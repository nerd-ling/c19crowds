HE GRAND REFORM PROCESSION was on its move, and the gates of Temple Bar, clesed only in honour of
the chief ones of the earth, slowly yielded way. Scarcely was passage made, when the GREAT REFORMER
rode proudly through.
“I shall go where I please,” said MR. PUNCH. “The Parks belong to the QUEEN (bless her) and to Myself.
Perhaps I shall visit them all. It depends upon whether I find my saddle comfortable. Follow, my faithful.”
His Young Men formed their ranks, waved their banners, and attended their glorious Chief.
The People were out “in their thousands,” and loud were the manly cheers, soft the womanly looks, that greeted
the Reformers on their March. Nor was it London alone that had come forth. PUNCH is the Guardian of the World.
From the Three Kingdoms, from all the Fifty Colonies, from the domains on which the sun never sets, from those in
which he never gets up, from the Arctic and Antarctic circles, from the Equinoxious Line, delegates had come to
signify the homage of distant regions. As MISS ISA CRAIG sang,
“He is a King for all.”
Along the Strand—that journey which is itself an education—proceeded PUNCH and his knights. Flowers rained
upon them, though flowers are awfully dear at this season. And as the unmatched Leader rode at the head of his
army, he shot benignant glances and uttered kindly words.
“If the idiot authorities do not soon sweep away that detestable street,” he said, with a look on his right hand,
“I will brick up one end and set fire to the other. Rebuilding Bell's Life, eh? Glad of my friend's prosperity,
How are you, FECHTER, happy to see you act again. How do, MR. GLOBE-revolved towards Conservatism, have you—well,
well, all parties should be heard. Gentlemen of Exeter Hall, the more HANDEL and the less humbug the better, and see
to your means of exit. BENJAMIN WEBSTER, the Evergreen, a merry Christmas—give my best love to Miss KATE TERRY.
Bless me, how the Strand is altered since I first went up it. Terminus at Charing Cross a boon to the civilised
world. Fine day, SIR Edwin, rejoined to hear that the Lions are so splendid—up with them. MR. BoxALL, very glad
to see you—a worthy purchase that Rembrandt. Academicians all, you know how I love you. My hat goes off to you,

my brave Physicians. Buckstone, a happy new year—glad to hear so good an account of BUCKSTONE fils. Along Pall

are we off for coals? On, my lads. Now, halt, and three cheers for Miss ANGELA CouTTs, who makes almost as
many people happy at Christmas, and all the year, as I do. WALPoLE, good day—when is the new Park-railing to
be put up—don't look sentimental, I like your honesty of feeling. Hyde Park Corner—easier to get up a hideous
statue than to get it down. Along Grosvenor Place, I want to see the alterations. My eye, what a havoc l Wonder
whether the new houses will be a success. Don't think the shops will. Victoria Road much too narrow for its work—

homage to her—0, Y.R.H. is going to lunch yonder—we meet again then. He knows me, your boy does—yes, my
dear, I am MR. PUNCH. Ha! JoHN BRIGHT, how dost thee do? Wilt come in on third day for a weed, I have
another good story for thine ear. Come with him, Bob Lowe, and keep him in order, but neither of you shall stay
after midnight, mind that, my eternal friends. Small and ragged boys, get from under my horse's legs, will you all?
There's a handful of sixpences—don't lay them out in Ritualistic tracts. In at the gate, my faithful, and guard me up
to the Palace door. I have an engagement in that edifice. Hats off, all, and nine cheers for the Princesses in the
balcony, and for Her who has commanded me to bring Her THE Book.
PUNCH dismounted, and turning to his followers, said, with his affable smile :-
“Let every man be Master of his Time. I dismiss you. All the great hotels are open to you, at your own
expense. I beg, as a personal favour to myself, that you will enjoy yourselves.”
Up went the shout into the Ether. And up, also went MR. PUNCH, mounted on his
fifty-first ºnlimt.

POLITICAL
HEN our last volume was closing, the Russell,
Cabinet had resigned office in consequence of the
defeat they had sustained on the Reform Bill, and the late
DARL of DERBY was engaged in forming a new Administra-
tion. After an unsuccessful endeavour to secure the pre-
sence in his Government of some members of the late
Ministry, and of the Liberal Section (the “Cave,” or
“Adullamites”) who had opposed the defunct Reform Bill,
LoRD DERRY sought and found the whole of his Adminis-
tration in the Conservative party, some of the principal
posts being filled by the same gentlemen who had held
office in his former ministry in 1859.
There being only a month of the session left after the
Ministers who were Members of the House of Commons
had been re-elected and the business of the country was
resumed, no measures of importance of their own origina-
tion could be introduced by the new Cabinet, or much more
done than to proceed with such routine legislation as it is
obligatory on Parliament under any circumstances to com-
plete. Before, however, the prorogation on the 10th of
August, one exciting occurrence happened which led to dis-
cussions in both Houses—the Hyde Park Riots. These
disturbances, inasmuch as they attracted a large share of
public attention at the time, and are the subject of frequent
notices in the earlier part of this volume, seem to call for
something more than a brief reference, and will be found
fully described in the following narrative taken from the
Annual Register:-
“This evening (July 23), Hyde Park was the scene of great confusion,
and a somewhat violent conflict between the populace and the police,
arising out of the Reform Agitation. A great meeting and demonstration
had been announced to take place within the Park by the Committee of the
SUMMARY.
Reform League; but the authoritics, disapproving of such an occupation of
a space devoted to public recreation, and apprehending a disturbance of
the peace of the metropolis, in case such a gathering were permitted, deter-
mined to close the gates of the Park, and to prevent the multitude from
attending the mecting. The adoption of this resolution cycitcd a deter-
mined spirit of resistance on the part of the Reformers. . . . As soon as
it became known that the police had received instructions to prevent the
meeting being held, a written notice was forwarded by the “Demonstra-
tion Committee" to the various Sub-Committees, to the effect that the
members were to march in procession to the Park, and if prevented from
entering it, were then to form four decp and proceed by way of Grosvenor
Place, Victoria Street, and past the Houses of Parliament to Trafalgar
Square.
The notice . . . concluded by czhorting those to whom it was addresscd
to show by their peaceable and orderly conduct that they were determined
to have Manhood Suffrage, and the Ballot. In accordance with previous
arrangements, processions were formed shortly after five o'clock in the
afternoon in the different metropolitan districts included within the opera-
tions of the Reform League. . . .
Meanwhile, vast crowds had collected in the neighbourhood of Hyde
Park. A force of foot and mounted police, numbering 1,600 or 1,800, was
here assembled under the direction of Sir Richard Mayne and Captain
Harris; and at five o'clock the gates were closed. Before that hour a con-
siderable number of people had collected insidc, in order to witness what
was about to take place, and these were permitted to remain therc. Out-
side, the throng was, as might be supposed, much greater. Masses of
people had assembled at all the approaches. The Marble Arch was the
centre of attraction. . . . Shortly after seven o'clock, Mr. Edmond Beales,
Lieutenant Colonel Dickson, and other leading members of the Reform
League, in a line of cabs which headed the Clerkenwell, Islington, and
other processions, advanced to the Arch, and, the Sub-Committee aving
succeeded in making a clear passage, Mr. Beales and his friends went up to
the police, who were drawn up in line, staves in hand, some of them being
mounted. The crowd immediately closed in, and endeavoured by an “ugly
rush” to cffect admission. The police used their staves freely to defeat this
attempt. After being refused admission, and having thus raised the ques-
tion in the form they desired, the leaders went back to their vehicles, and
with some difficulty managed to make their way through the crowd in
order to proceed to Trafalgar Square, there to hold the meeting, according
to the programme which had been laid down.
Printed bills were distributed among the various detachments as they
came up from Clerkenwell, Southwark, Finsbury, &c., directing them not

to attempt to forco an cintrance into the Park, but to proceed to Trafalgar
Square. It is much casicr; however, to collect throngs of people than to
keep them in leading-strings when collected, and a large portion of tho
“masses" were not disposed to follow implicitly the instructions of their
leaders. The gates, it is true, were strongly fortified, but to throw down
the railings seemed a feasible undertaking, and this was promptly at-
tempted. The police, indeed, hastened to every point that was attackcd,
and for a short time kept the multitude at bay; but their numbers were
utterly insufficient to guard so long a line of frontier, and breach after
breach was made, the stonework, together with the railings, yielding
easily to the pressure of the crowd. The first opening was made in the
Bayswatcr Road, when the police, rushing to the spot, prevented for a
time any considerable influx of people; but they could not be ubiquitous,
and along Park Lane especially a great cztent of railing was speedily over-
turned ; till in the end the crowd entered ad libitum.” A good deal of scuff-
ling attended these incursions. The police brought their trunchcons into
active use, and a number of the “roughs” were somewhat severely handled.
Several persons received injuries which caused them to be carried off to the
hospitals. The police, on the other hand, did not come off unscathed.
One of them received a thrust in the side from an iron bar; another was
knocked off his horse by sticks and stones, and several others sustained
slight injuries. Stones were thrown at Sik Rich ARD MAYNE, who, as well
as his men, was much hooted. Between forty and fifty persons were taken
into custody in the vicinity of the Marble Arch, and about as many more at
the other approaches. Many of the leaders of the crowd exerted them-
selves to prevent a breach of the peace, and MR. Bit ADL \ugh got consider-
ably hustled for so doing, falling under the suspicion of being a Govern-
ment spy. About eight o'clock a company of the Grenadier Guards and a
troop of the Life Guards cntered the Park, but it was then too late to pre-
vent the influx of people, for, though the gates were still jealously guarded,
breaches had been effected in every direction in the palings, and the mili-
tary, who were loudly cheered by the crowd, confined themselves to
manoeuvres, the only effect of which was to oblige the mob occasionally to
shift their position. . . . Specches were made at various spots. . . . None
of the speakers, inale or female, were interrupted by the police. By this
time darkness was drawing on, and the crowd rapidly thinned, until, at
about ten o'clock, only a very few persons remained in the Park.
With regard to the proceedings of that scetion of the Reformers, who ad-
hcred to their original programme, it is sufficient to state that on arriving
opposite New Palace Yard, some of the more violent of the party attempted
to get over the railings into the square, but in this attempt they were corn-
pletely foiled by the police, who were posted in the enclosure. At this
point there was much cheering, and among the shouts could 'e distin-
guished the name of MR. BRight, a reprint of whose letter in The Times
had been extensively circulated during the day. . . . Arrived at Trafalgar
Square, MR. BEALEs ascended the base of NElson's Column and conn-
menced haranguing the crowd. . . . MR. BEALEs was followed by several
other gentlemen, who all concurred in condemning the conduct of Sir
Richard MAYNE and the Hoxtº: SEcitºtARY. Two other meetings were also
held in the Square, under the presidency of Mtssks. How Ell, and CREMER.
This part of the proceedings, however, was exceedingly tame after the ex-
citing scene which had been cmacted in the Park, and the fatigued audi-
cnces were glad to get back as soon as possible to the various public-houses,
which served as their head-quarters.” -
Several of the ringleaders of the riot were fined or sen-
tenced to short terms of imprisonment on the following
days.
Turning to the Continent of Europe, the conflict between
Prussia and Italy, and Austria and a part of Germany,

Road and Park Lanc, mark the cwtent of the damage done on this occasion.
proved short but decisive. War having been proclaimed in
the month of June by the KING of PRUSSIA against Austria
and all states allied with her, the Prussian armies entered
Saxony and Hanover; while the Italian forces crossed the
Mincio and advanced against the Austrians, but were met
at Custozza, defeated after a severe battle, and forced
to retreat. A few days afterwards the Austrians in their
turn were defeated at Nachod, in Bohemia, by the Prussians;
and again on the 3rd of July at Sadowa, near Königgrätz,
also in Bohemia. This was the greatest engagement of the
war, and the most disastrous for Austria. The following
day the Emperor of Austria asked for an armistice, which
was refused by Prussia; he then ceded Venetia (after-
wards rendered to Italy) to the Emperor of the l’rench,
who offered his mediation and proposed an armistice.
Accordingly on the 26th, an armistice and the pre-
liminaries of peace were agreed upon between Austria
and Prussia, and on the 2nd of August peace was signed at
Prague, Austria consenting to her exclusion from the
Germanic Confederation, and agreeing to pay a large sum
towards the expenses of the war. Prussia, as the result of
her success in this war——which has been called a “ten days
war.”—gained a great increase of territory; so that “she
incorporated into her dominions, Hanover, Hesse-Cassel,
Nassau, Hesse-Homburg, the Duchies of Schleswig, Hol-
stein, and Lauenburg, (these last, however, had been pre-
viously annexed), that part of Hesse-Darmstadt which lies
to the north of the Maine, and the little principality of
Hohenzollern—the cradle of the Prussian Royal House—
situated on the borders of Lake Constance, between Wur-
temberg and Switzerland.”
At Home one or two marked events remain to be noticed.
HER MAJESTY's third daughter, the PRINCEss HELENA,
was married to PRINCE CHRISTIAN of Schleswig-Holstein-
Sonderburg-Augustenburg on the 5th of July; on the
27th of the same month the laying of the Atlantic Telegraph
Cable between this country and America was successfully
accomplished, and congratulatory messages were exchanged
between the QUEEN and the PRESIDENT of the United States :
great Reform meetings were held in the Autumn and
Winter, both in London and the country; a large body
of our Volunteers visited Belgium, and were most hos-
pitably entertained by the King and the civic authorities;
London, especially the East-end, was visited by cholera;
the Fenian Conspiracy was revived in the Autumn; and
the great meteoric shower which had been foretold for the
night of the 13th of November took place at the time pre-
dicted with extraordinary splendour,

ÇiğCHQ would have in-
eed laboured in vain
... for five-and-twenty years
if, at the beginning of a
- - - - - second quarter of a century,
he foundit . to imitate his contemporaries, and to address himself
to solemn leading articles upon the state of the world. But having several
original remarks which he, desires to utilise, and several quotations
which he is anxious to ventilate, he so far conforms to the course of his
brother journalists as to throw his o ening observations into the didac-
tic form to which the general j is accustomed. He can only
say that it will be entirely in opposition to his intention if, at the
close of the present article, the reader shall find himself either
improved or instructed. , Should the following remarks be effective
.ºins a single mind, the object of the article will be completely
autallleſl.
What, let us aski is the condition of England at the existing moment?
The question is idle in the extreme, and therefore the more fit, to be
asked when the atmospheric influences are most conducive to idleness.
MR. Hoop has remarked that his thermometer was at 80 in the shade,
and that this was a great age. Similar reports are now furnished from
the observatories, but no person reads reports or anything else. We
recur, therefore, to our original proposition, which we forgot to make,
not that we hesitated over the probabilities of its acceptance, but
because too many acceptances have been issued of late, and in conse-
quence the word “late” has been the befitting prefix to the mention
of establishments formerly of financial repute. But if we ask ourselves,
at the present time, what is the position of the Bank of England,
we cannot think that financialists would be much re-assured by the
statement that it adjoins the Royal Exchange. Such is one of the
results of forgetting the golden rule, Nemo repente fuit turpissimus.
Again, let us regard the political aspect of affairs. . Until the new
Premier shall have been assured that gentlemen are inclined to take
office under him, it would, we must be allowed to hold, be almost pre-
mature in him to submit their names to the Sovereign, and to direct the
issue of writs for new elections. , We, do not, accuse the EARL of
DERby of any intention to recruit his Ministry by force, but too strict
a watch cannot be kept over the principles of the Constitution; and it
would be a humiliating sight to see the law advisers of the Crown, and
the Home, Foreign, and Colonial Ministers, dragged to the House
under the stern surveillance of the police. We cannot forget that
OLIVER CROMwell, whom MR. CARLYLE and others admire so much,
ejected Members by violence, and though at first sight the cases may
not appear to be exactly parallel, we confidently affirm that there is no
clause in the Bill of Rights, no provision in the Statute of Frauds, that
treats as a lesser violation of right the compelling a statesman to take
office than the extruding him from the House of Commons. We make
these remarks in no unfriendly spirit towards LoRD DERRY, many of
whose family #. at Brompton are worth inspection, but we have
not yet learned to despise the salutary counsel contained in the maxim,
Judea damnatur cum nocens absolvitur.

compensations for grievances. If the streets of the metropolis are

wantonly torn up and converted into railway chaos, there have never
been so many good singers collected at the same time as are now to be
heard at the it. Italian Opera. The state of our cabs, and the
manners and morals of our cabmen are a disgrace to civilised society,
but the Bishop of LoNDoN resented in a becoming manner, the
angry language of DR. WILBERFoRCE at the late meeting of Con-
vocation. e do not look, with any violent interest upon the
progress of the Central Hall at South Kensington, but it is, some
thing to know, and we do know, that the practice of introducing
whitebait early in the dinner, instead of at a period when the appetite
is sated, is gradually making its way among sensible persons. .Nør
do we refuse to see, in the fact that the #oyal Academy is likely
to be removed to Kensington, an insufficient consolation for the
incompleteness of the Nelson monument. Omne tulit punctum qui
miscuit utile dulci.
It is not in these columns that habitual reference is made to theolo-
gical matters, but as regards the Ritualists we feel bound to express a
very decided opinion, and to use strongly condemnatory expressions.
We therefore say emphatically that it will be very satisfactory if they
are led upon reflection to reconsider some of their convictions. But
we are not reckless in our denunciation. For the stout, short, and
protuberant ecclesiastic who makes a Guy, of himself º the adoption
of a gorgeous costume in which he º a glorified porpoise, we
can entertain none but the sentiments of a harpooner. For the slender
and elegant young priest whose weakness of intellect, may, excuse his
fondness for millinery, we, having recently visited the admirable Asylum
for Idiots, own to a touch of tenderness. But it may become our
painful duty, at no great distance of time, to warn the clergy who will
not let § alone, that a {}. is already on foot for erecting, for the
Registrars of Marriages, edifices of a graceful description, with stained
glass windows and other luxuries, and that it will be a bad day for the
parsons when the first fashionable bride shall listen to the º
vow under the roof of the Registrar. We may add that many distin
guished bridesmaids have informed us that the dirty state of yarious
metropolitan churches is a consideration which will not be overlooked.
We commend these matters to the attention of all who are concerned.
Wictoria Romanis multo sanguine stetit.
It will not be expected that we should close these observations
without a special reference to ourselves. But it is contrary to our
reticent custom to intrude ourselves upon the attention of the reader,
and in the present case our indisposition to speak is, sºmewhat
increased by the fact that we have § to say. We shall pursue
the course which has hitherto been attended with so much satisfaction
to ourselves and the public, unless we should see ſit to depart from it,
in which case we shall have as little scruple in obliterating our engage:
ments as we have of hesitation in entering into them, and we shall
content ourselves with remarking that, although where ignorance is
folly, it is bliss to be wise, the proper study of mankind is not only
man, but the gentler sex, which doubles alike our misfortunes, and our
expenses, and is quite welcome to its share of both. Such willhº our
guiding principles for the quarter of a }.} before us, and if forty
centuries were looking down upon us from the Pyramids, we should
still say, Honorest a Nilo.

PARALYSING PIECE OF NEWS FOR MR.
Mrs. B. “MR. B. MR. B. : : HERE's
OUR COAL AND OUR COUNTRY.
MR. PUNCH,
GRAVE fears have lately been expressed by grave men that our
coal measures will have been practically exhausted within two or three
generations. What, then, ji'. do for force and for fuel? That
is the question which the Legislature is urged to consider by provident
and philosophical alarmists. It is a question relative to the subter-
ranean domains of England. But there is a parallel question, which
does not appear to have occurred to any of those prescient gentlemen.
What, in the meanwhile, will become of England's superficies?
Suppose that all our available coal is a quantity not sufficient to last
much above another century. But then suppose also that the gas-
works and factories and furnaces of England go on multiplying at their
present rate of increase. Suppose, too, that our population continues
to advance in the same ratio."ff the bowels of the ſand are consumed
in a hundred years' time, will not its face be likewise used up -
not this Island, honeycombed underground with excavations in barren
rock, aboveground be clustered all over with towns, separated by small
interstices of utilised sewage? And must not our rivers then receive
the jº', which it will be impossible to utilise?, Will not the merry
England that once was have become a hotbed studded with# egations
of bricks and mortar, and channelled with gutters? ill not our
herbage and foliage have been for the most part destroyed by the vitri-
olic fumes of chemical plants, and the remainder have been blackened
by factory smoke? Is it not likely that Great Britain will be exploité
no sooner underneath than all over, and in short that our coal will not
fail a moment before it should? On the other hand, is it not rather
possible that the country may be completely spoiled long ere the coal
that sustained its progress is nearly gone?
No alarmist myself, Mr. Punch, Y., º: one conceivable fear
to balance another. If we anticipate the exhaustion of our coal, we
may just as well .. the "pº of our space, and the consumma-
tion of our national career. For my part I fear neither one event nor

(Thoughts, on the far side of the Rubicon, by the Right
Honourable W. G.)
Lo, here, across the Rubicon,
e gather, stranded, on the strand–
Behind us the wide stream runs on,
Before us lies the promised land,-
Tracts whose bright hues, far off, might please,
But, closer scanned, a desert seem.
No treasury-loaves upon the trees,
No treasury-fishes in the stream |
The natives flock, of looks uncouth,
And blatant speech—a salvage crew,
Not such as in my Oxford youth,
Or manhood's Peelian prime I knew
When Church and State—two schemes in one—
Loomed on my brain through morning haze,
And by the old ways I wandered on,
Nor dreamed of treading other ways'
They raise their war-cries' shrilly screech,
ere our burnt boats bestrew the sand,
Dance round us, hail with rugged speech
And wave rude Stars, with welcoming hand!
Not such the greetings I foresaw,
When dreaming, studious, in the schools,
Of Commons bowed to Canon's law,
And Statesmen squared by Churchmen's rules |
Are these the men with whom my fate
Is linked, since here my boats I burned P
To this wild shriek of haste and hate,
Must my mellifluous tongue be turned ?
Must my wide vision shrink to theirs,
* vast horizon marrow in,
To this poor round of §º
And mob-led, or mob-leading, dinº
Bethink thee,_“they are flesh and blood,”
Are brothers—asses though they be:
That progress points, where o'er the flood
Is shaped, I hope, the great “to be.”

doubtless turn up, or else turn down. Somebody will discover a cheap
way to set the Thames on fire, or to draw below, and store, atmospheric
electricity. By a system of vertical elevation instead of lateral exten-
sion, our architecture will be adapted to our area, and our cities, no
longer expanding, will continue to ascend. The higher they rise, the
less will Posterity be troubled with any amount of smoke which it may
be unable to consume. The future of England will then be as fresh as
a daisy, still as familiar a flower as ever, and will wear the same roseate
aspect as that under which it now presents itself to the exstatic vision
of an ever hopeful OPTIMIST.

At first sight what there could have been, in an announcement that

may not be manifest. Perhaps it was the understood intimation, in an
ironical sense, that the EMPEROR was believed to intend making a
demonstration of respect for the Press.

FANCY IN FASHIONS FOR JULY.
»
“Sweet are the uses of adversity.” For the following good news
announced under the head of “Fashions for July,” by Le Follet,
ºntº is doubtless indebted to the Panic and 10 per cent. in
the City:-
“We are happy to announce a decided reactionary movement towards simplicity
of attire. There can be no question that luxury in dress has of late been indulged
in to an alarming excess. It is therefore gratifying to observe that the leaders of
fashion now show a decided inclination to allow the judiciously elegant to replace
the merely expensive; we no longer see toilettes covered and sparkling with gold
i. º these theatrical ornaments having given place to ribbons, flowers,
aces, &c."
It is true that theatrical gold and theatrical silver, are not precious
metals, and that the cost of such tinsel may be indefinitely exceeded by
ribbons, flowers, laces, &c.; especially “Sºc.” But, PATERFAMILLAs
may doubtless rely on the essential truth of Le Fallet's testimony to
the comparative cheapness of fal-lals for the time being. Thank the
alºs.
In the succeeding observations, Le Follet really shows sense :-
“Summer is undoubtedly a time of rest for the purse and of work for the fancy.
Expensive fabrics and trimmings are not required; a few simple materials, elegantly
made, so as to permit the possessor to appear often in what the Parisians call une
toulette fraiche, being all that is necessary, except for very dressy occasions, such as
Jétes or marriages."
Few things that º poet has ever said of summer will be deemed by
PATERFAMILIAs equal to the º of Le Follet about it. “Summer
is undoubtedly a time of rest for the purse and of work for the fancy.”
Most undoubtedly, as regards toilettes. Oh, Le Follet / thou art, a
summer bird! As to whitebait dinners, and the like, the case may be
rather different. The purse cannot rest if the muscles of mastication
and deglutition are to act. Though fancy may be all-sufficient for the
love of finery, it will not supply the pleasures of the palate. It may
make une toilette fraiche answer every purpose, but not provide a
cool cup or a satisfactory repast out of simple and slight materials.
So much the greater reason why fancy should do all the work that
ever it can to the end of resting the purse. Therefore, rive la toilette
fraiche while, the summer lasts; and let us hope that, in winter time,
fancy will still find scope for economy in the tasteful arrangement of
the cheapest of all those substantial fabrics which will then be necessi-
tated by the severity of the season.
In female education the importance of fancy in relation to dress, has
been grievously overlooked. A woman whose fancy has the power to
make an alpaca equal to a silk, or a merino to a moiré antique, is the
wife for a wise man's money; because she will not squander any of it
on excess of apparel.
COMIC TALENT.
AMong a number of other odd theatrical requirements we specially
select the following for remark:—
ANTED, COMIC and SERIO.COMIC TALENT of the Highest
Order, for June 25th and future dates. No stamp. Silence a respectful negative.
What is called the “comic business” in a Pantomime consists in
the transactions of Pantaloon and Clown, and these persons not unfitly
may lay claim to have some comic talent, for we know it takes a clever
man to play sagaciously the fool. But where is “serio-comic talent.”
displayed upon the stage, unless perhaps in the performances of certain
great tragedians, who play the sombre parts so funnily that they always
make one laugh. To them the gentle hint “no stamp'' seems *.
addressed; for these serio-comic actors are usually addicted to much
stamping when they act, and it would be wise, we think, to add the
further gentle hint, “no strut.”

[JULY 7, 1866.
TWO EIGHTEENTHS OF JUNE.
(The declaration of war between Austria and Prussia was exchanged on
the 18th of June, the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo).
'Twas one-and-fifty years ago,
The night of an eighteenth of June,
That o'er the field of Waterloo,
Rose, round and red, the summer moon.
And England, weak with loss of blood,
And black with battle's reek and stain;
From strength o'er-taxed half-swooning stood,
In trampled corn on Soignies' plain.
All day, from rainy dawn to dark,
She had looked on, in voiceless awe;
While the huge eagles grappled, stark,
For life and death, with beak and claw.
And ere that night the moon rode high,
The greatest eagle of the brood,
ose wings had darkened earth and sky,
Lay spent and shattered and subdued
Then—upshot of that awful day—
She saw the ‘...i i.e. bind
The conquered Eagle, as he º
Bafiled and bleeding, bruised and blind.
Saw censers swing above the blood,
Heard o'er the groans Te Deums rise;
And marked how reek of carnage stood,
Between the incense and the skies.
And then she saw the Eagles sit,
n crowned conclave, grave and grim;
To rend, what with a wicked wit
º called “freed” Europe, limb by limb.
Parcelling out, with haughtier air,
The lower they had lately quailed—
A gobbet here, a gobbet there,
As Eagle's craft or strength prevailed.
And England looked, and England thought,
That, like dogs, eagles have their day.
Too well she knew who most had Þji,
For fighting who'd had most to pay.
Her whistle won, 'twas time at length,
To count the cost, in purse and veins,
Where waxing debt, .# wasting strength,
Öf men and money told the drains.
Kings—Peoples—two in one, that hold
Close union as veins and skinſ
Kings—to pay out the blood and fºld.
And patriot Hºn. pay in
So has been, shall be, human hap:
So England saw, 'twas then to be,
Monarchs remodelling the map;
Europe, made free with, not made free.
And she who had borne the battle's brunt,
She who the pipers had to pay,
Now saw pretensions first in front,
That most kept out of danger's way.
Little of all she’d won she kept;
Gen’rous, when all were grasping round,
She saw the board of winnings swept,
By players whose first stake she’d found.
Now, one-and-fifty º are past,
'Tis the eighteenth of June again :
Again the summer-moonlight's shed,
On new cut hay and greening grain;
And once more i. stands aghast,
As, north and south, from near and far,
The shrill war-trumpet wakes the blast,
And Europe leaps again to war.
Nature and Man are still the same :
The earth as fair, as fierce its lord:
And still we see the little game
Of kings and peoples keeps the board.
But though the board, cards, game are one,
How different the players show
From those of that Eighteenth of June,
Now one-and-fifty years ago!
Then fierce BRITANNIA in the strife
With purse and person foremost stood.
Reckless of reason, flush of life
Less prodigal of brains than blood:
Then the black vultures, side by side,
The great French e linked to tame,
And, England aiding, checked its pride,
Banished and banned, and put to shame
Holy Alliance' Then we saw
Pruss, Russ, and Austrian combine
O'er Europe's war-blurred map to draw
The measuring-tape and marking-line.
France crush'd, and revolution done,
And peoples taught they can't be free—
'Tis strange, when vultures are at one,
How wonderfully they agree
Now, see this goodly work unpick’d—
Holy Alliance drawing swords !
Eighteen-fifteen's arrangements kicked
o shivers by its sovereign lords:
NAPOLEON's forfeit name, once more,
tº- Symbol of European power,
France at peace, arbiter of war
The Emperor master of the hour!
And England folding brawny hands,
And looking on with even heart,
As one who by a quarrel stands,
With neither brawler taking part—
Oh, startling difference in the tune
Öf the war-dance that now we know,
And that which closed, the Eighteenth of June,
Now one-and-fifty years ago |
CRIMINALS AND PAUPERS.
Not know how to treat our criminals' Don't we, though' Just
See now.
First of all, you catch your criminal—a brutal wife-beater, we will
Saý, or else a ruffianly garotter. Fat eaperimentum in corpore vilissimo.
à. having caught your criminal, cage him in a workhouse. Keep
him on thin gruel, and not too much of even that. § down to
skin and bone, and take all the spirit out of him. Give him work like
º; stupifying and monotonous, and never let a ray of hope
in to enlighten him. -
Then, when he falls ill, which he is pretty sure to do, confine him in
a sick-ward, which is crammed to suffocation., Huddle him with a
herd of raving, filthy lunatics. Taint him with the breathing of a
dozen diseased lungs. . Keep him, wakeful by the coughs of the
asthmatic and consumptive. Crowd round him the beds of paupers
dying of infectious cholera or fever. Prop him with hard pillows, fresh
taken from a death-bed. Tend him with hard hands, hard eyes, and
harder hearts. Let Ignorance and Malice sit watching by his side,
and Drunkenness and Dirt be installed as his head-nurses. Give him
physic by hap-hazard, measured by the rule of tipsy, shaking thumb
and fore-finger. Dose him with a purge if he complain of being aguish,
drench him with a salt-draught whenever he feels thirsty. Šio d he
be paralysed, take no heed of the bed-sores that will scourge him. Let
him lie, and slowly rot to death, and so be done for.
In short, treat your brutal criminal as you do your wretched pauper.
Torture British Vice to death as British Innocence is tortured. Leave
off petting your foul gaol-birds ¥ assaulters and garotters. Mould
your model prisons on the model of your workhouses. , Let your con-
victs lead the dog's-life that your paupers long have led, with just a
taste of the “cat” now and then by way of fillip. Then see the reduc
tion there will be in gaol-returns, and how the threat of workhouse
torture will tempt Vice to be virtuous.

which mingle lovingly in its gleaming gloom.
It is said, and it is done. On the day of the Moon, and on the 25th
day of June, Çame down the Earl, whose name is Russell, and spake
unto the Lords, *Hºº “The Commons trust us not, and therefore
we are no more. ave I not sent unto the QUEEN ? Begone, there-
fore until the hour of six to-morrow, when I shall have spoken to the
Lady of Windsor, and the rest shall be made known unto you.”
Likewise spake GIApstone, in the same sort, unto the Commons.
At the appointed time they came. The two Ministers had visited
Windsor, and by reason that other Royal Servants had blundered,
there were no carriages at the station, so the statesmen footed it unto
the mighty Castle, and were cheered by certain of the people. Of
what ºl between their Sovereign y QUEEN VICTORIA and
themselves, Russell and GLADstone made speech in the chambers
of legislation.
The EARL Russell, spoke unto the Peers. His feelings were those
of no ordinary emotion. He and his colleagues had tendered their
resignation, on the decision of the Commons upon the motion of
LoRD DyNKELLIN. The §§ had desired them to re-consider their
resolve, for it appeared to the Sovereign that they had been defeated
only on, a Point of Detail, and that with Europe in a flame it was no
time to be changing the English Ministry. At much length the Earl
adduced the reasons which induced him to differ in opinion from
Majesty. He defended the Reform Bill, complained of the hostility of
its enemies, and declared that honour iº the resignation. He
hoped that Parliament would not treat the claim of the artisan with
contempt, but would make generous concessions. Otherwise they
wºuld alienate, the people from the Crown and the Aristocracy.
Although unable to agree with the QUEEN upon the Point of Detail,
the Earl complimented Her, handsomely, upon her general discharge
of her royal duties.
º the EARL OF DERBY, that he had earnestly hoped to be able
tº listen in respectful silence, but the other Earl had been personal.
The change of Government, at such a time, was most unfortunate, but
it was the fault of the Ministers. They had been met only by consti.
tutional opposition on, matters of great magnitude. The &:
narrogant and, injudicious, alienating those who should have
been conciliated. And t $. resigned, on a Point of Detail, not
affecting the amount of the Borough Franchise, which had never been
discussed at all, The Commons had chosen to exercise their right of
judgment and therefore the Cabinet had resigned.
Bari Grºsviliº answered with . irit, and EARL GREY, in a lo
speech, condemned both the Reform '#' and the Ministers who h
abandoned it. Specially, he flagellated them for having put themselves
into the hands of MR. John BRight, of Birmingham.
In the Commons, after some of that easily evoked merriment for
which the Nether House is famous, and which seemed scarcely justified
by the cause—a doctor's statement that a certain Member had been
taken ill after a party—the Leader of the House, delivered an address.
It was, in the main, similar to that of his Chief, but it was marked by
such extreme good temper and grace as to produce a salutary effect
upon his hearers. He moved an adjournment until the Thursday, with
the idea that by that time Some Person might be able to propose a
her adjournment.
Some Person was Edward GEQFFREY SMITH STANLEY, K.G., better
known as EARL DERBY. To him the QUEEN had said, by letter
“Make a Cabinet, if you can.” And we learned that the Earl designed

assemblages just then, but he scoffed at the idea of apprehension. e
also warmly complimented MR. º the conciliatory way
in which he had spoken on Tuesday, for whic fº utterances
MR. NEwdEGATE was gracefully, thanked by the ex-CHANCELLOR or
THE Exchequer, But, before this, we had a speech from -
...MR. BERNAL OSBoFNE, who was perfectly discontented with the
situation. A commercial panic, Bank discount £10 per cent, an attack on
Canada, revolution in Spain, war in Italy, war in Germany, and the
nation for a fortnight without a Government....MR. GLADSTQNE had
vindicated his honour, but not his judgment. The Reform Bill ought
not to have been abandoned. The QUEEN, was of opinion that there
Was no 5. for a resignation. The whole session had been wasted.
Qther valuable Bills were shelved. The Qpposition had opposed fairly.

those exquisitely neat Gladstonianisms which seem to Mr. Punch to
belong to High Art. The QUEEN had regarded the defeat as one upon
a Point of Detail, but he had never said that after personal communi;
cation it was Her Majesty's opinion that her Government had resigned
on such a point. We have no doubt that in MR. GLADSTONE’s Letts's
Diary, or whatever volume he keeps, he has set down the exact words
of his Royal Mistress. Will he make a small bet with us, say a claret
cup, to be ordered next time we meet at the Club, that the words were
not these, or very nearly P “Well, if, My Lord and Mr. Gladstone,
wou say that it is a point of honour and not of detail, I can say no more,
but that I am sorry to lose your services.” We do not hold him
to claret, if he likes champagne better—we trust that we can be as
conciliatory as himself. - -
Thus stands the situation, and thus it will stand, so far as Parlia-
ment can, officially, know, when the world is reading this history. The
only secret which we shall, without regard to any ’s feelings, at
once disclose, is this, MR. WHALLEY has been offered—but no-we
must not convulse the country. We only warn all Roman Catholics
that the sooner they make arrangements for emigration the better. If

The Lords met on Friday, to hear from EARL Russell of the
requested adjournment. honour to the Peers. They improved
the occasion by rejecting the Bill, which the Commons had passed, for
ruining Victoria Park by means of Gas Works. May their Lordships'
own trees be green and flourish.
Gallus and Caesar.
THE MEssrs. LoNGMAN are publishing the third edition of a work
by the learned PROFEssoR BECKER, entitled, Gallus; or Roman Scenes

so apt as it would in connection with that of NERO.

SPEECHES BY AN OLD SMOKER.
PHYSICAL pain not the worst of evils, Sir? What other evil would
you not endure rather than grasp a red-hot poker by the fiery end for
one minute 2 MUTIus ScAEvola P. Either a myth or a madman. Case
of CRANMER P Miraculous, if true. Enthusiasm and mania are some-
times anaesthetic. Insensibility is not endurance.
Did you ever have the gout, Sir? Ah! I thought not. Nor even
the rheumatism? Well; that’s bad enough. Lately attacked this
thigh, Sir. Hurt abominably: hindered stooping. Problem in such
a strait, Sir, to put your socks on.
Might not the problem have been solved by a wife? Yes, Sir, I felt
that. Apprehended, during rheumatism, the * there may be
in matrimony. “O, woman, in our hours of ease !” You know what
follows. Weil, but, Šir, if she is a ministering angel only in your time
of trouble, and always inconstant, and coy, and hard to please except
; habitual suffering is the necessary condition of your conjugal
elicity.
But woman is not hard to please in your easy time. Scott was wrong
there. There is no ease without easy circumstances. If you have
plenty of money, you can always please Woman. You can let her dress
ad libitum, and act regardless of expense, and take all the consequences
of her doing so, and the blame of them, on yourself, Sir.
However, Sir, I don't say that when Poverty comes in at the door,
Love always flies out at the window; and I trust JoB's wife was an
exceptional person.
No doubt, Sir, woman can do much to comfort man. Can she miti-
gate his pecuniary anxieties? Yes, Sir, by succeeding to property.
Plenty of money is the sine quá non of domestic bliss especially. Less
will do for single blessedness. A safe annuity of £500 a year would
put you, as a bachelor, out of your misery. . As a married man, you
should have three thousand at least, derived from fixed capital. Then,
you know, Sir, you wouldn't have to insure your life, and stint your-
self of claret and cigars to pay the policy.
BENEFICE AND ECCLESIASTICAL MARKET
INTELLIGENCE.
. In a list of “Livings for Sale,” announced by the Times, the first
piece of Church preferment specified bears the highly appropriate name
of “Simonburn Rectory.” . The rectory of Simonburn is described as
“valued in the Clergy List at 426l. a year, with a population of 599
persons.” Such an easy cure of souls as this might, have contented
IMON himself, if SIMON's ideas of duty, and regard to emolument,
corresponded to the views of a modern simonist.
Singularly enough, the self-same catalogue of ecclesiastical invest-
ments also includes the particularly well-entitled benefice of “Hum-
shaugh, º: to Simonburn, and P. C. 120l. a-year, popula-
tion 443.” dimly conjectured
What “P. C.” means may be d to be a
per-centage in some way connected with Simonburn through Hum-
shaugh; but, at any rate, there is an obvious relation between the hum
of Humshaugh and the simony of Simonburn.

I saw BUMBLE Dives, smooth, oily, and fat,
In a glossy black coat, and a shiny black hat,
With a belly well lined, and a fair double chin-
All so soft none had guessed at the hardness within.
None had guessed that 'neath shirt-front so fair and full-blown,
In the place of a heart BUMBLE buttoned a stone:
Till at Guardians’ meetings the º: felt floored
To say which was the Stone-yard and which was the Board.
At his own dinner-table Host DIVEs I saw
Ply a keen knife and fork and a strenuous jaw:
I saw DEAcon Dives loom large in his pew,
Where sermon and prayer once a week were gone through.
I heard GUARDIAN DIVEs one Board-day address
To his colleagues an eloquent word on the Press:
What sad lies it told ; what sore mischief it wrought;
How it still against Local Self-government fought;
How the poor it spirited up to complaint;
And their Guardian-Angels as fiends loved to paint: :
Would have sick }. treated as well as their betters—
To be sure, what but paupers were most men of letters?
I saw Visiting-GuARDIAN Dives parade
Between rows of sick paupers to murmur afraid;
And over his shoulder I ventured to look, -
As, in large hand, he signed “No complaints” in the book.
And yet I had seen BUMBLE Dives walk through
More infernal infernos than e'er DANTE drew :
Past huddled-up horror and filth thrust away,
Where the tortured their tortures dared *tray.
Where, unchecked, madness howled, and foul idiotcy laughed;
Where fever lay parched, nor dared ask for a draught:
Where coarse food, random dose, were flung round with a curse,
And the sick pauper's cordials made drams for the nurse.

IN connection with the question of Clerical Westments, the Venerable
ARchdEAcon Hopkins proposed, as a gravamen, the numbers o
curates, in most dioceses, who were accustomed not only to accept,
but also to wear, showily embroidered slippers, manufactured for them
by }. ladies, members of their congregation. He moved “That
in the opinion of this House the colour of a clergyman's slippers ought
to correspond with that of his cloth.” - -
The Reverend LIMPUs HobbLEDAY seconded the motion. His own
curate was continually receiving from young ladies presents of slippers
for which that young man had not the least occasion. The work o
worki º for young curates was at best a work of supereroga-
tion. Now he (MR. HobbLEDAY) was an old Rector. He was very
much afflicted with the gout; might call himself Priest and Martyr-
to the gout. A comfortable pair of slippers would be a real boon to
him, and working them for such an one would be a work of charity;
But not a single young woman out of all his flock had ever presented
him with anything of the kind, although it was obvious that such a
present would constitute a most appropriate testimonial.
After some banter and much recrimination, the Venerable Arch-
deacon's motion was rejected.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
PARLIAMENT waited to hear the arrangements made by Some Person.
Some, Person's, Cabinet was being constructed, and will have been
revealed, in all its magnificence, before these lines are read. Mr.
GLADston E took a brief and gentlemanly farewell of the House, that
is, from the Treasury, Bench, and thanked his supporters for having
sustained him º recent struggles.
Meantime, that which would have been a Parliamentary theme but
for the suspension of business, the miraculous European War, could
be but briefly alluded to. Loßn Brough AM expressed his horror at
the slaughter and suffering which the struggle had occasioned, and
MR. LAYARD had an opportunity of certifying that the telegraphic
news was accurate. In a few days, therefore, from the declaration of
War, Prussia had acquired a vast extent of territory, had beaten down
Austria, out-mandeuvring and out-fighting her, and would have been
in full march for Vienna, but that Austria cried “Enough,” gave up
Venetia to France, to be rendered to Italy, and begged for an armis-
tice. Italy is free from the Alps to the Adriatic. ś. does not,
at present, belong to France. This is the quickest war ever fought.
Let us hope that it is quite over. What say the Ultramontanists to
the preternatural triumph of Protestant Arms?
Only Half an Advertisement.
The first line of one of MR. WINING's advertisements to the quick
and superficial reader runs thus:–
MRs. STIRLING will appear this evening in the HUGUENOT CAP.
and very becoming such head-gear must be. This presents an attrac-
tion to the Princess's in itself, even if the “-tain” did not occur in the
next line to tell us of the novelty at this theatre.

THE PERILS OF THE PARK.
How long are we to wait for a proper staff of park-keepers to manage Rotten Row, and
prevent people on horseback from half-killing other people? To ride there at high noon now
is like being in the thick of a cavalry . ement. Last week H.R.H. the PRINCE of WALEs
was cannoned off his horse, and it was on º: a hair's breadth that the Heir escaped dire injury.
Perhaps next week H.R.H. Mr. Puncil may get bowled over, by one beast on another, if means
be not devised to make the Row more safe to ride in. Surely it is time, then, for some one to do d
something to protect such precious lives, which are daily now endangered.
Men, who merely use the Row as a place to get a gallop in, should clearly be kept out of it at
certain times of the day, when a gallop there is dangerous. , When crowded at mid-day the Row
is not a place for rapid equitation. It is simply then a show-ground where fair centauresses
congregate, chiefly for the sake of exhibition to the centaurs. Gallopers should then not be
permitted to intrude: Let them take their sweating at some less frequented hour. A man
who would go galloping among a crowd of frightened girls is a snob whom it were flattery to
call a selfish brute.
There are other brutes whose presence is a danger in Hyde Park, and these are the stray
curs which are suffered to infestit. They delight to spring forth suddenly and bark at horses'
heels, occasioning great terror to indifferent equestrians. It often happens that a horse is
frightened by these beasts, and the sooner they are shot and turned to sausage-meat the better.

I had never seen a mountain. I beg their pardon, though, I had seen some ºn Wales, which
the natives, I believe, consider to be mountains. But the biggest is a pigmy to the Pyrenees, and
Snowdon, is a mole-hill to the snow-crowned Maladetta, Cader Idris must be doubled to reach
as far as º up the 'Pic du Midi, and were Helvellyn placed a-top of the shoulders of Ben
Nevis they could stand beneath the arm-pits of the white-peaked Mº, When, at Biarritz,
I saw some of the princes of the Pyrenees afar in the horizon, I felt that I must go and lay
my homage at their feet, and take my hat off to their Highnesses. As the loadstone .# attracted
Sinbad and his ship, they drew me to their presence with a power quite resistless. And I fear it
ls lºbe to try and get away from them, until all the metal has been drawn out of my
pockets. . - - -
. It surprises me to think how very little I had heard about the beauties of these moun.
tains, Everybody chatters of the wonders of the Alps, but, since the war in the Peninsula,
“il n'y a plus de Pyrenées" in London conversation. English tourists are, however, a race
moutonnière; John BULL is a mere º in following old beaten tracks upon the Continent.
Great Britons by the thousand flock to Switzerland each autumn, but there are hardly half
a hundred who think it worth their while to see what France and Spain can show them in
the way of mountain scenery. . Yet, from what my eyes have seen, and my ears have often
heard, I believe the Pyrenees in some respects are far beyond the Alps in beauty. “Mont
Blanc is the monarch of mountains,” I admit, and the princes of the }. are not to be
compared with her Highness the jungfrau, or his Mightiness the Matterhorn. But for
varied woods, and hill-sides seamed with
flºº cascades, for valleys bright with
owers, and musical with rapid, rushing,
murmuring, mountain rivers, the Pyrenees,
Ifancy, are unequalled by the Alps.
o
What is, DAURER doing that prevents his
coming hither? Why do BRush and MAUL-
stick go eternally to Wales, and never
ream of studying this far finer mountain
scenery : , Here are clean, cheap, pleasant
inns, and kindly peasant people, with bright
eyes, and brown faces and picturesque cos-
tumes. Here for figure-painters are girls
and women calmly a-straddle on their mules,
or walking with enormous loaves upon their
heads, while their hands are always spin-
ning as busily as spiders, Here are she
herds ever knitting the while they tend their
flocks, and wearing their hair closely shorn
upon the forehead, and falling in long tangled
clusters, on the neck. Here are railways
within shot of the shadow of the mountains,
Here, are footpaths for pedestrians, and
smooth roads for the carriages of voyageurs
en prince. Here are comely, light-brown
oxen, yoked to farmers' carts and ploughs,
and wearing picturesque white hairy, mats
upon their heads. Here are goats that bound
about the boulders on the hill-side, and pigs
washed in the gutter side by side with your
dress shirts. #. is foliage intermingling
darkest and lightest hues of green, and mea:
dows bright as rainbows in their varied floral
colours." Here, too, are craggy peaksfºr hardy
clamberers to climb, and lakes as cold as ice,
in which they may bathe, if foºl-hardy. , Herº
are mountains lifting their bare heads, all
silver-streaked with snow, above . nd,
#!". crags and cliffs, besprinkled with dark
rs and bright green birch and beech trees,
in a way that would assuredly, remind me
much of Norway, if I had ever been there.
Here, for water-colourists, are falls that
shine like ice, with seeming hoar-frostin their
midst, and here are “gaves,” or torrent
streams, not muddy like the glacier falls, but
flowing crystal clear: now brown, now bright-
|est green, now fretted overrocks and frothing
white as 'snow, and sounding like the sea-
roll on a shingly level shore.
Wishing much that, like the people of
Laputa, you could send me one of your eyes
to see this lovely mountain scenery, I
remain, with the assurance of my most pro-
found intention not to leave it till you force
me, yours serenely, WAGABUNDUs.
- without much exploration I gathered Alpine rose
(or rhododendron), dog ditto, and sweetbriar, daphne,
columbine, hopatica, gentian large as well as little,
| cowslip, violet, yellow poppy, pink, periwinkle, but-
terwort, achimenes, . daffodil, heartsease, corn-
flower, squills, hyacinth, saxifrage, forget-me-not
(which grows there by the acre) and double yellow
ranunculus, with a score of other lovely spring and
summer wild-flowers, of which I was not botanist
enough to know the names.
MUSIC AND MADNESS.
ThistLEs grow in Scotland still, and long
ears likewise. Only look at this now :-
“What Constitutes MADNEss.-The Scottish Com-
missioners in Lunacy state in their report for 1865
that in the course of that year a patient was brought
to a lunatic asylum with the certificate of a medic ºl
practitioner giving (by way of compliance with the
statute)’ as the fact observed by himself in proof of
insanity, that the patient “has a great desire to
appear conspicuous as a musician.' "
Scotland has never produced a great
composer. And no great wonder either; at
least, if Scotch people in general be like this
medical practitioner, and would shut up as
a lunatic any one who thinks that he knows
something about music.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“BY MY FAITH. A GENTILE.”
Right does not edit his
paper with care. We
make all allowance for
the crisis, and the de-
sirability of tall talk,
but even in the midst
of battle a gentleman
is a gentleman. The
Star lately issued a
squib to which the hon-
ours of leading article
type were assigned,
and which was, there-
fore, either considered
good by the manage-
ment, or was written
by somebody who must
be obeyed; and this
squib, which is stupid
andinartistic (because
the writer has not the
brains to be either
consistently serious or
jocular), sneers at the
new Government as
having a branch “un-
der the charge of an
enterprising and well-
known member of the
Hebrew persuasion.”
This is false, and is
also vulgar. Mr.
Punch has not been
articularly “soft” on
º Disraeli: and
- possibly the Cartoon of
last week may not be hung up amid the choicer ornaments at Grosvenor
Gate, but, "Ir, Punch has never seriously misrepresented MR. Dis-
RAELI's religious opinions. MR. Dish AELI's father was a Hebrew,
and a learned and delightful author. MR. DisrAELI is a Christian,
and MR. BRight knows this perfectly well.
Protest is needed against this Americanisation of our journals. Let
us keep to satire and sarcasm, as hot as we can make it, but let us
avoid the New York Herald style. Mr. Bºrºnt is a man of too much
real courage to be afraid of reprisals, but it would be disagreeable to
his personal friends to have change for “Jew” in “Quaker.” Let
him bear the Conservative Millennium with patience—everything has
an end. Meantime, let him order his organ to imitate the manner of
gentlemen.
BLOCKADES AND BLOCKHEADS.
EveRYBQDY knows that qur system of self-government is absolutely
perfect, and no true Englishman would venture to suppose that it is
capable, in any manner, of improvement. Yet, º, now and
then we hear audacious hints that the various powers which govern the
streets of the Metropolis are not to be commended for the way wherein
they generally fail to do their duty. The paving, lighting, watering,
and draining of our streets have with great wisdom been entrusted to
the government of several quite separate authorities, and it is said that
Commissioners, and Vestry Boards, and Corporation somehow never
do the things that should done, and never leave undone the things
º should not dream of doing.
. Complaints, too, have been made that these authorities are far too
independent in their action, and that in any street improvement they
scorn to work together. At the present time, however, there is a signal
instance to the contrary of this, and for the glory of self-government we
are glad to call attentiºn to it. At the very nick of time when the pick-
axes are hard at work in lowering Holborn Hill, and blockading for
awhile that, unfrequented thoroughfare, the streets adjacent have been
also handed over to the paviours, and the traffic through the neigh-
bourhood is very nearly stopped. Of course, the Vestries might have
known what the City meant to do, and might have got their streets in
readiness to receive the extra traffic which was obviously imminent. But
instead of this, they acted with true British ºil. and post-
poned the paving-rammers till the moment when their advent would
produce most inconvenience. Assurelly, in this case we cannot charge
the vestries with not having º ‘worked together” with É.
City, for under the two governments the works of re-construction are
wisely simultaneous.
Faces IN THE FIRE.-Hob-Goblins.
TABULA RASA.
Now clear the board from trace of fight,
Sponge up the bloody battle-stains,
Hustle the wounded out of sight, -
Hide mangled limbs and scattered brains;
With new n cloth the table crown,
Set the fauteuils in order due,
Take the old map of Europe down,
Bring rule and compass for the new.
Three weeks' and lo, the wonder's wrought !—
A great war closed ere well begun :
A twelve days' battle bravely fought,
And half a century's work undone.
No hand of his set to the task,
The EMPEROR's will to act is borne,
“The treaties of fifteen?” we ask,
And staggered Europe answers, “Torn.
Oh, irony of mocking fate'
The doomsters falſen from their stools:
The doomed, set high in peaceful state,
To mete the doomsters' realms and rules.

But wise the velvet glove to wear, -
Which masks, not mars, the iron hold.
They meted Europe, king to king,
kings' not Heaven's nor nations’ will:
And now o'er-mastering forces bring
The first to nought, the last fulfil.
And if a BISMARck seems to gain,
Or a NAPOLEoN to o'er-rule,
God’s Providence of Bism ARck's brain,
Or Louis’ craft, can make its tool.

be conveniently done under glass, so that the passengers would be as

PUNCH To THE TORIES.
MY DEAR LORD's AND GENTLEMEN, 85, Fleet Street, July 11, 1866.
HERE you are in office again. Accept such congratulations as you may think the situation deserves. I know what three or
four of you are saying to yourselves in #}
ow, listen to me, the Member for the United Kingdom. - -
I have, on former occasions of a similar character, given you advice and warning, I have been hideously abused by your organs, and I
shall be hideously abused again. But that is a trille between friends and gentlemen. It is more to the purpose to remind you that you have
always split on the exact rocks which I have done myself the honour of pointing out. I daresay that you will do so again, but I shall do my
duty to yourselves, as I do to all my Sovereign's subjects. - - - -
. From neither GLApston E, BERNAL Qsborne, nor myself need you expect any Taglious Opposition. From the third of these respected
º you will receive absolute justice, and, if you deserve it, some little kindness. I like to see turn and turn about in office, occasionally.
t is astonishing what new lights on the claims of the nation gentlemen obtain when they have to make themselves amiable to the nation.
And, personally, I like some of you very well. So don't say that [. unfriendly, .. - - - -
. .You will not remain in office yery long. The country elected, last time, a Parliament in which you were in a minority of 60 or 70. That
minority vanished during certain debates, but will reappear at need. If you dissºlve, you will be placed in a still lºss favourable position. I
do not wish to discourage you, but, though I think that you ought to be allowed fair play, it will not be constitutional to let you remain in place
long after February next. -
But you may do yourselves an awful lot of good between this and then, if you mind my counsel. . . - - -
You have nothing to do with a Reform Bill. We must have one, but you are not asked to make it. Dismiss that ſºn your minds.
You cannot carry that measure. You will go down on it, if you try. Never mind LQRp WESTMINSTER. He is not everybody.
Go to work directly, however, as you would if sure to be in office during the whole of next Session.
There are some large-minded men of business among you, and there is some new blood which ought not to fear Cant. - -
Address yourselves to the preparation of certain Domestic measures, which ought to be ready when you meet Parliament in the spring.
Firstly, Deal with Bumbledom and the Blackguardians of the Poor in a strong sound measure of Reform.
- ...}} Deal with Juvenile Crime and Destitution. Pitch, all Cant to the First Whig, and prepare a scheme for the Compulsory
Emigration of Juveniles. Let obvious want be the qualification, and empower the authoritics to rescue these unfortunate children from their
parents, and transmit the young “flesh and blood” to colonial reformatories, where a redeemed race may grow up to bless the old
ºntº to enrich the new, - -
hirdly. Deal with the Church Rates. Abolish them altogether. The trumpery money is not worth a word. The surrender of the tax
by you, the Church's friends and champions, will in itself be a victory to her. No one can say that it was forced from you. Lord DERBY has
not been afraid in other days, of bowling over half a score of bishops, like nine-pins. sº he has lost no nerve.
Fourthly. Deal with the Needle-Gun question. This is the question of the day. . If Jos ATIAN PEEL, who appears to be aware of the
value of the invention, puts the terrible Zündºadelgewehr into the hands of our soldiers, in spite of the certain opposition of the Horse-Guards,
and vested jobbery, he will be the best War Minister we shall have had for half a º - - - -
Now, there is a Quadrilateral for you, my Lords and Gentlemen. I do not say that you will be able to hold it, this time. But what a
splendid set of fortifications for you to return to hereafter, meantime claiming them as your own. . . . - --- -
... Only, be bold. These things must iſ done. Why should you not have the credii of initiating them?, Windicate your claim to be
considered as a constitutional power, whether in or out of office. You are pledged to nothing, you have nothing to fear. You must fall.
But leave those four monuments of your brief existence, and the Tory Eagle | your infernal fº have not murdered him as they do
all the other eagles) may hereafter fly from point to | and gaze fearlessly up at the Sun of Popularity.
And don't say that I did not give you invaluable advice at the exactiour of need.

* INTERESTING CERE-
Monv.–At the village
church at Claydon, in
Suffolk, afew days since,
at 8 A.M., about twenty
children (who had been
confirmed by the Bishop
on the previous Friday)
assembled and walked
in procession to the
parish church to receive
their first communion.”
The contemporary
to whom we are in-
debted for the fore-
going information,
which, certainly is
very “interesting,”
would naturally be
º to be the
Tablet. The phrase
used in describing
the object of the children's procession is one peculiar to the denomina-
tion represented by that organ; and the service to which they repaired at
8 A.M. was, in fact, Low Mass. 'But howcame flow Mass to be celebrated
in the º: church of Claydon, and who was the Bishop that had
confirmed the children? ell, the Tablet would speak of one of its
own bishops as the bishop, in contempt of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act,
and might argue that, as there is no true church but its own, the only
village church at Claydon was the Roman Catholic chapel there. The
continuation of the news above quoted is altogether in the Tablet's vein:
sº
.
ºſſ
“The church was crowded with devout worshippers. The young communicants,
many of whom were not more than 12 years old, were ranged before the altar, the
girls on the left, the boys on the right side. All were neatly dressed, the girls with
white veils and carrying bouquets of roses. The Rector celebrated the Holy Com-
munion, and after the Gospel delivered a short address to the children. . . . The
sermon ended, the celebrant resumed his eucharistic vestments, and after the con-
secration, the hymn “O Salutaris Hostia" was sung by the choir.”
Very proper, as a late Royal Duke used to say—very proper—in a
. Catholic church. Equally proper and suitable was what
ensued :- -
“The children received the Holy Communion immediately after the communion
of the priest, nearly the whole congregation remaining throughout the office. After
the blessing the “Nunc Dimittis' was sung, after which the altar tapers were extin-
guished, and the procession of the young communicants left the church in the
same order as before."
The paper, however, which contains the preceding intelligence, is
not the Tablet, but the Ipswich Erpress. There is reason to believe this
to be a journal in the spiritual interest of a Cardinal whose historical
celebrity has rendered him the boast of his native town. The Erpress
of #. concludes its account of an “office” whereat Wolsey
would have felt quite at home, with the following-observation:—
“Every one who was present at this most interesting service was struck by the
happy yet serious and reverent demeanour of the children.”
By
The Ipswich Erpress is, no doubt, less exclusive than the Tablet.
the village church at Claydon of course it means the village church so
commo } called; º the bishop the Lord Bishop of the legal diocese;
and by the rector the parish parson. It informs us, then, that the
“most interesting service” of early mass was performed the other da
in one of the churches of the Church by Law Established. Hence it
appears that the Rector of Claydon has gone over to Rome. It appears
so that he has at the same time remained where he was. This is a
mystery, and indeed a miracle, but it is one which Protestants cannot
deny, though they may decidedly º: to it. Mass in a parish church
exemplifies nearly the perfection of tolerance, which only has to be
completed by the abolition of the Act of Settlement. That might be
desirable to prevent mistakes. The Rector of Claydon, and his Bishop,
may have a dispensation from the Pope to retain their places; but
this is not known. In the meantime Ritualists may be vexed by the
consideration that, according to the original Mass-Priests, a mass
celebrated by a parson whom the Pope does not recognise is a sham,
and its “celebrant” a humbug.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
oNDAY, July 9. The
§ new Premier, the
EARL of DERBY,
came down to ex-
ound to the
eers and the
universe why he
took office, and
what he intended
to do. The DUKE
of CoRNWALL,
and his bride the

of KENT, and a
crowd of Nota-
bles were present
to hear the elo-
quent PREMIER,

to remain what he
had been for
seven years, the
head of a .
powerful enough
to exercise no inconsiderable control, to give the Minister useful support or check,
and to help him to hold back the extreme radicals. Had Lord PAIMERStoN lived
this would have been Lord DERby's wish. The departed nobleman had declared
that it would be unwise to attempt Reform this Session. LoRD RUSSEIL had
miscalculated, public feeling on the subject. The Commons, would not, have a
hastily-framed and fragmentary Bill forced upon them. Had the late Ministers
treated the Commons with consideration, resignation would have been needless.
But the QUEEN had, in the most gracious terms, desired him to make a Cabinet,
and he had done so. He had tried to form one on an enlarged basis—not a
Coalition—but a union of those who were separated by insignificant variations
of P. For there were no deep divisions between moderate Conservatives
an ºrate Whigs. However, he had not been able to enlist any outlying
recruits.
Here his Lordship introduced an awful
appearing in EARL DERRY's chamber in St.
to say that he could not join the new Cabinet.
He went on to tell the troubles of a Minister who has to make a Cabinet, and
how difficult it is to place the men, at once to their liking and to the interest of
the public. He then set forth the views of the new Ministry. Conservatives
generally had large stakes in the country, and therefore it was absurd to suppose
that they should desire war, the consequences whereof would, visit them most
heavily. He thought that we ought to be on terms of good-will with all nations,
not entangle ourselves in needless alliances, and not volunteer advice on which we
did not intend to act—as, Lord Russell, had done. Never mind our individual
ºš. in regard to the present bloody war, let the Government be Strictly
and Impartially Neutral.
[Here their Lordships sounded the note of plaudit, and Mr. Punch begs to indorse
that Note, thereby giving it value and currency.] - -- -
The PREMIER complimented the wisdom which PREs, DENT Johnson is displaying
in re-construction, and expressed the utmost gratitude for the vigorous measures
he had taken *; the Fenians.
Here again Mr. Punch is with you, my Lord, and, the weather being warm, he
takes this opportunity of liquoring in honour of jº. and MR. Johnson.]

Reform Bill cannot be carried except by a mutual, understanding between
the two great parties. He had never been adverse to the principles of Reform,
and, thirty-five years back, had helped EARL Russell, to carry the Reform Act.
But those who are most clamorous for another Bill will probably not be satisfied
with such a measure as the Great Parties may approve. Amy Bill of a moderate
character will be a mere Stepping Stone. -
Without discussing these º your Highness, we have said that you
had better let Reform alone, and that is enough for you.] - -

Finally, I hope for the Co-operation of many who are

not a nominal distinction of parties, on one side those who
are in favour of dangerous innovations and violations of
the Constitution, and on the other the friends of legisla-
tive º;
And the Earl ended with an eloquent firework about
our glory and prosperity, and on the whole was considered
to have acquitted himself boldly and well.
The Ex-PREMIER then took his innings, but, as usual,
this Earl was pleased to mumble in such a way that neither
the Princes nor the reporters could make much out of some
of his sentences. e thought, that Lord PALMERstoN
would have changed his mind if he had lived. He thought
the Reform Bill moderate, for it excluded 100,000 persons
who would have been admitted by the Bill of 1860. Lorp
ERBy might not have desired office, but what did he look
to as the result of his party's incessant resistance to the
Bill?, Lord DERBy had spoken of his difficulties, but let
him look at his advantages. MR. GLADstoNE, more suc-
cessful than even MR. Pitt, had put finance straight. The
Jamaica question had been admirably treated. The Fenians
have been put down, Lorp. CLARENDQN leaves foreign
affairs in an admirable condition. He hoped that out ot
this war German Freedom would arise. As to interference
as regarded Denmark, who could help speaking out when
treaties were violated?
[It is º that EARL Russell said many other re-
markable things, but a Minister who will take only his hat
into his confidence cannot expect justice from the rest of

So ended the sitting of the Lords. The Commons could
do nothing until the new Ministers should be re-elected.

their poor—the room used instead of one being a work-room, which serves also for
a nursery, a directors' dining-room, a receiving ward, and various purposes; whilst
the sacrament is administered in the vestry hall. If St. Pancras, however, has not

chapel, for the paupers of St. Pancras, made by the Rev. 'Sermºs Buss, their
chaplain, to their Board of Guardians:–
“Mr. CHURCHwandrs Robson said theirs was the only workhouse in the metropolis without a
chapel, and it was beneath a great parish like theirs to be without one. He moved that the
subject be referred to the select committee, which was agreed to.”
There are doubtless churchwardens who would deem it beneath a great parish
to be without a beadle attired in a sufficiently gorgeous uniform. Such gentlemen
would consider that it was likewise beneath their parish to be without a workhouse
chapel, regarding the chapel, equally with the beadle, an appurtenance essential to
parochial consequence. Of course, MR. CHURCHwaRDEN Robson meant to say
that it was beneath the spiritual dignity of St. Pancras parish, alone of all the
parishes of London, to have their workhouse unprovided with a chapel. You are
right, MR. CHURCHwa RDEN ROBsoN–you are right, Sir.

But “L’Empire c’est la pair!” and France is fain
To fold her hands: let the mad nations jar;

The mélée slackens, the war-reek blows clear,
And, lo, emerging from the waves of fight,
A mightier Prussia, of prouder cheer,
And statelier stride, and more majestic height.
Blind, battered, blood-drained, beaten to the knee,
Sore-stricken Austria before her reels;
But e'en in this, her hour of agony
A Parthian blow at Italy she deals.
After one stroke struck manfully and fair
Between her brows, upon Custozza's plain,
Calling in show of scorn to mask despair,
She cedes to France what she can not retain.
“The time is come: the game is at the best.
Is not this war a tournament for me?
And I king of the lists, to º: my hest,
Throw down my warder, bid the knights let be?”
The word is spoke, the warder is thrown down,
And baffled Austria is content to hear:
But how of Prussia? Will she wail the crown
She’s won so well—so long has looked to wear?
And Italy—e'en as she § the goal
Of a life's hope, how she stoop thus low,
To see Wenetia, like a beggar's dole,
Or Kaiser's appanage, tossed to and fro P
That fair Venetia, for whom her gold,
Her youth, her strength, her blood, were price too
Small,
By desperate Austria, to buy safety, sold
To France, as lord of old might sell a thrall!
Will Italy deign thus to round her crown
Lower her lance's point, and rein her steed,
Before the Imperial warder, thus thrown down,
A second time, in Austria's hour of need?
Who knows? 'Tis easier to avert the fight
Than stop it, even for Imperial power:
War is God's scourge: once raised, it must alight:
Its staying waits Heaven's, not the Évrenor's hour'.
Much in a Monosyllable.
WITH respect to European civilisation, there is little to
be said about the Battle of Sadowa. The first syllable of
its mere name is sufficient. It is “sad.”

DEMORALISATION
OF OUR WEST-END CORRESPONDENT, AFTER THE LATE ROTTEN-ROW CONTROVERSY.
SOMETHING BETTER THAN BEEF.
DURING the late battles in Bohemia, both the Prussian and Austrian |h
cavalry sustained severe losses. This circumstance may account for
the fact that a grand banquet in honour of the intrºduction of horse-
flesh as an article of food took place on Tuesday last week at
Lamandelay's Great Room, Rue Richelieu, M., DE, QUATREPAGES,
member of the Institute, in the chair. It is possible that some of the
meat consumed on this occasion came directly from the field, trans-
ported by railway with sufficient speed to prevent the influence which
would otherwise be exerted upon it by hot weather; for though it
is fine to ride the high horse, it is not well to eat him. Or the
hippophagists may have thought the carnage in §. offered a
seasonable opportunity for a demonstration to show that of the quantity
of flesh left upon a battle-field all need not be wasted; so such of it
as, in warm countries, is left to be devoured by vultures, being, in
temperate climates, available for the food of man. According to the
Paris correspondent of the Times:–
“182 guests sat down to table, and all, without exception, declared that the
dinner, of which the principal dishes were formed of various parts of the horse, was
excellent. The º from bouillon de cheval, the saucisson de cheval, horse-
flesh d la mode, and lastly, the filet rôti, were all eaten with great gusto, and pro-
nounced most palateable.”
Only one species of soup is named in the foregoing outline of a bill
of fare of which the elements were derived from the noble animal.
There exists, doubtless, another. The º must needs have
a horse-tail soup that corresponds to oxtail; and perhaps they have
also a mare's-tail soup and a colt's-tail soup; the latter analogous to
“Chesterfield.”
As to the saucisson de cheval, that probably is no novelty: many who,
when they think they are tasting it for the first time, having in fact
eaten it very often, before under the simple name of saucisson...So
likewise horseflesh á la mode may often be an old acquaintance with a
new name, formerly familiar under that of a la mode beef. The filet rāti,
however, running with gravy, may be new to those who have been
accustomed to see fillies run only as they run for the Oakz.
By the account above quoted, the banquet which it reports was the
manifestation of a “movement,” with a regularly organised committee,
to promote the use of horseflesh as an article of food. Its sale, in that
character, is now authorised in Paris; and doubtless horse-restaurants
will soon be established there. If we also take to horse, and horse eating-
ouses are established in, London, a slight change will probably be
made in the appellation whereby they are denominated in the vulgar
tongue; and instead of being termed cagmag-shops they will be called
“ſº - - -
continuation of the preceding extract, we are told that :-
“A number of the ordinary meats produced at a choice dinner were also served
up, but the company found the horseflesh so savoury and agreeable that they
remained faithful to it."
Also that:—
“M. DE LA Bédollière sang two new songs composed for the occasion: one
‘C'est le Cheval qu'est le Baruſ,' and the other "Enfants, n'y touchez pas.' The couplets,
which were extremely witty and appropriate, obtained a merited success."
All this looks rather suspicious. Horse may be good enough, but
if it were really more “savoury” and agreeable” than “the ordinary
meats produced at a choice dinner,” its superiority to butcher's
meat, as contradistinguished from knacker's meat, would have been
discovered long ago. A decided predilection for horse looks like
idiosyncrasy—to use a mild if a long word; and enthusiasm
may be inferred from such a song as “C'est le Cheval qu’est le
Boeuf.” We have outgrown old English prejudices, and no longer
regard as a typical Frenchman the one who, whilst he condemned our
cookery eulogised our meat—delivered, as he said, at the door on the
end of a skewer, Nor do we any longer suppose that the generality of
the French habitually eat frogs. The Société º perhaps
Il
may, going the whole horse, eat .# and all; but must it a tough
morsel. ese epicures are evidently ... ." - - --
Among the toasts with which the hippophagists in the Rue Richelieu
washed down their horse was one proposed by M. SIBIRE in the name
of the Society for Protecting Animals. Of course an animal enjoys
the temporary protection which preserves it to be ultimately eaten.
The horse protected for the table is, in the meanwhile, º
exemption from ill-usage, and also in the speedy extinction of life,
wherein he is spared from the death of lingering misery which awaits
the uneatable English pauper.

for one week, perhaps, in the year, and who can't follow the rapid dia-
logue of the plays they nightl rush to see, to disparage English acting,
of which they know, probably, very little, as compared with Frenc
acting, of which they know jus nothing at all. Then they take credit
to themselves for “a pretty good acquaintance with the language,”
and being “accustomed to French theatres,” whereas the idiots can
scarcely speak two words of the language, and are utterly stranded
without constant reference to a jº.

PoRK-chops for supper I esteem;
But arter which it warn’t no dream |
A man must sleep as well as º
To dream a dream—but I was hup !

As plain as I sees you!
The Westry ad been werry ot,
And I had gone and ad my pot,
But sober as a Judge need be,
A smokin of my yard of clay,
A walking home—there—in my way—
There—right afore me—there stood he .
He that to name his name I fears,
For talk about im he appears
I know'd im by his glarin eyes,
His orns, his oofs, his wings, in size
As might be of a normus bat,
iſis colour black as this ere at;
Ay, this ere at—without the lace—
The orrid grin of that ere face!
His mouth just like a grate red-qt,
Which fangs like iron spikes he'd got,
I know’d him by his crooked nails,
And by his ide all over scales,
His arrer-pinted tail—his prong.
—I see a flash of fire—I hear
The sound of, as it were, a gong
And boh, he did appear!
The sight so scared me I sprung back,
And bumped agin a post, right smack!
And with the shock I broke my pipe.
He come—I bobbed—he missed his gripe.
Down on my marrowbones I prayed
In hagony for Mercy’s aid.
He wanished in a flash of flame,
then a glorious hangel came,
- And said, “Here’s Mercy at your call,
Though you don't merit none at all.
This mornin, at the Workus door,
You druy my Sister from the Poor.”
Says I, “I won't do so no more.”
No; mind you don’t,” said she.
“For if agin you ever do,
Next time as Somevun comes for you,
Expect no help from me.”
A CHEER FOR CLAN HALPIN.
OMENS follow those who note them. And “we defy augury.”
These are things to say when unfavourable omens occur, and unwise
persons allude to them. But when a grand enterprise is preceded by
a gallant deed on the part of one of the undertakers, it may be per-
mitted, in a spirit of the most intense and Lord-Stanleyite coolness, to
say that the probabilities of success seem increased when the work is
seen to be in the hands of brave and daring men. We wish all good
fortune to the monster vessel now engaged in laying the Atlantic
Telegraph. We cannot help feeling that, in the above sense, a good
omen has occurred, in the gallant deed of which LIEUTENANT HALPIN
is perhaps the only man in the country who thinks lightly. , We read
that, a sailor, charged with a difficult duty aloft, lost his head, and
would have been dashed to pieces, but for LIEUTENANT HALPIN, who
rushed to the rescue, climbed the rope, supported the fainting man,
and held on, over the yawning abyss in which the gigantic machinery
was working, until help was afforded. No moble thing that a true
British sailor does can much surprise his countrymen; but it is fittin
that LIBUTENANT HALPIN and all the rest of the world should be toi
that when Paterfamilias read this story at the breakfast table, an
electric current of enthusiasm set, in for the great ship, and on
board, who will, we think, be proud to be called the CLAN HALPIN.

THE SONG OF THE MARRIED SOLDIER,
ALL you in Parliament and place,
So careful of the nation's coin,
Come, hear a married soldier's case
From one who never will rejoin.
I served my country long and well
In India, and in otherlands
And did a private soldier dwell,
Until tied up in wedlock's bands.
At Chatham quartered now we lie,
And married partners, other three,
The same apartment occupy
Along with my young wife and me.
Our beds are four, and bed and bed
Have no º ot between.

To see how you good soldiers use,

Why they to re-enlist refuse.

Such usage is the way to gain;
And you can but expect an ass,

Where soldiers grow of service tired,

A Reason Why.
THE Law of England, as we all know, is the perfection
pf human reason. It is doubtless, therefore, with a wise
intent that our Law declares the property of a suicide,
found felo dese, forfeit to the Crown. In thus disinheriting
a man's relations, the Law can possibly only proceed on
the presumption that nothing whatever can drive anybody
in his senses to commit self-destruction but the misconduct
of his family. If this, is not so, the sooner a law which
|É. innocent widows and fatherless children is abo-
| lished, the better.
A NEW IDEA.
At a time when the nymphs of Society are scared away from their
dances by the spectres of bank failures, the following notion is most
reassuring :-
Cautious Dowager. Three or four pic-nics in Richmond Park, and
dances afterwards in the evening, during the season. More than a
hundred persons, at each party, too! I don't understand how SIR
JAMEs manages it. It must be very expensive.
Little Dancing Captain (who, having married on small means, has been
rather curtailed in his entertainments, and runs the risk of losing his invi.
tations). Oh, no, not at all. Simplest thing in the world. SIR JAMEs
asks lots of people to º: their own hampers, own carriages,
and so forth; no expense then. Very jolly party. Dance afterwards:
rooms in hotel. Guests invited: pay five shillings each for a ticket
for their hat or cloak. That clears expense of room, ices, biscuits,
sandwiches, and orangeade., SIR JAMEs doesn't spend a “fiver” over
it. Good idea—doocid good idea! Sh’ like 'try it m'self.
Cautious Dowager (reserving her opinion). Dear me! Indeed!, Very
p. arties, no doubt. (Captain rises.) Mind you remember me

the vestment question—the clothes ºf the season. The Bishops could
not cope with it, though they turned Convocation into a Westry. The
word of command has been given to that pugnacious section of the
Church militant which fights for its gay clothes—“Dress!” What a
pity that our young Curates cannot find some better investment for

The line taken by the chief º of the #. Church party, at the

verse ! There is but one bard who can do it justice—PoET CLOSE.

Still, though nothing can be done now towards reforming of the

England, everybody knows, is quite a model nation, but her poor-

nations have a custom of killing their old people. We, who are more
civilised, only kill our poor folk. There are savages whose practice is
to thrust forth all their sick, and leave them in the open air, where
they may slowly die, untended. We, who are more merciful, crowd
our sick poor in fouſ rooms, that they may die the quicker.

GREAT SHOW OF CH IGNONS.
A HINT FOR THE HAIRDRESSERS’ SOCIETY.
“LORD DERBY'S WORKSHOPS.”
We hasten to rectify a remarkable omission in the account of these
spacious premises in the Builder. No mention is made of the elaborate
piece of Cabinet work, long in, preparation, which the indefatigable
prºprietor has at last succeeded in completing, and although the
‘Joiners' *. is noticed, not a word is said about the curious speci-
men of inlay, known to have been designed, in which the initials of the
. operatives,...B. DisRAELI, E. H. STANLEY, &c., were to have
gracefully blended with those of some of the leading employés of a rival
firm that has recently retired from business.
We are authorised to state that the Derby Workshops are now re-
moved to a more sº situation in Downing Street, S.W., where
the proprietor hopes by a strict attention to business, the use of none
ut the best materials, and a due regard to economy, to merit a
renewal of patronage, and support., (Treasury) Benches re-covered,
and Woolsacks re-seated. Households supplied. Some novel designs
in Secretaries. A stock of new Boards on hand. Cabinets turned
out at the shortest notice. Experienced workmen sent to all parts
of the kingdom to attend to Hustings. Plans for a Bankruptc
Court, and an improved Pauper Infirmary will shortly be submitte
to public inspection at the Offices, close to Westminster Bridge.
Estimates given. Accounts rendered quarterly. No connection with
any other firm. Clerk of the Works, J. MANNERs. The India Branch
is carried on in Cranborne Alley. - - -

Fº MR. Colºridge, Q.C., and D.R. LushingtoN, are the two

used to be imprisoned in the Pastille.) It is used in Le Prophète at

DoNNE, the present excellent censor, has never yet been swung in

The Precentaur is a mounted Ecclesiastic who leads all processions.

sented as a surprise. They are going to order §. :—
“A Rheumatic, a Cubicle, an Operetta, a Stole, two Copse, a Muni-
cipal, and a handsome Jezebel.”
We venture to suggest that there are one or two trifling errors in
the above list, which may possibly puzzle the Ecclesiastical tailor.
Suppose we read:—“ atic, a tunicle, a beretta ( eculiarly

But for the purely disinterested motives which always

like that of Sadowa, would be simply the conglomerate of
murder. A mangled body, however, is a mangled body, no

of that simply a horrid object, neither more nor less.

For Cabinet-making was always hard labour,

We’ve done all we could to enlarge our connections,

But the party from over the way had objections, -
And we’re forced to fall back on the old style of thing.

MR. BERNAL Osborn E attacked the Conservative Irish Law appointments, and
to the purpose., MR. BLACKBURN, aged 85, has been made Lord Chancellor
instead of MR. BREwsTER, wh9 ought to have had the place, but being a moderate
man as well as a great lawyer, is hated by the bigots. MR. Joseph NAPIER, who
is “ .#. ” is made head of the Court of Appeal. These are, simply jobs
H. orced on the Ministry by its Irish supporters, but none the less—we had
tter say all the more–disgraceful on that account. Mr. Disraeli had to make
an answer, but it was very helpless, and could be nothing else. He said, moreover,
that he meant to adopt the intention of the late Government and lend public money
on the Irish Railways. MR, MILL says that it is unphilosophical not to perceive
that Ireland is unlike England, and ought to be dealt with in a different way,
and certainly, the Government seem inclined to violate the rules of common
sense, of J. economy, and of professional etiquette in the Irish arrange-
ments..., Idiotic oaths, false charity, and imbecile justice are the small trifles i.
which the affections of the Irish are to be gained.
Then we had Ireland again, but this time MR. GLADSTONE and the late Cabinet
were in the mess. The Catholics, who if *. learned nothing else of the
Protestants, have successfully studied their bigotry, will not have their sons
taught algebra and the Greek chorus § persons who do not believe in the
Immaculate º any more than ultra-Churchmen will allow their children
to learn the rule of three from Unitarians, or hydraulics from Baptists. Well, if
they won't, *: won’t, and until all grow wiser, the best way is to assist them
in obtaining what they consider harmless teaching. , But it seems that the late
Government, pledged to the Irish Catholics to do something in respect to
university matters, managed to do it, or rather to attempt it (for the business looks
like a mull), in an underhand way, and in breach of a pledge that the House of
Commons should have an opportunity of discussing the question. Whereupon
of course, we got up a Shine. MR. GLAnstone's defence could not be calle
satisfactory, and MR. Lowe hit out hard. MR. DisBAELI promised that the whole
subject should receive the best attention of the Government, so that there is a
good opening for another rising and intelligent young muddle.
Tuesday. Interrogated as to his intentions with regard to the Black-guardians of
the Poor, MR. HARDY, we are sorry to say, intimated that he, hoped to effect
reforms without taking new powers, and without using compulsion., A certain
credulity on MR. HARDy's part § have recommended him to the dull men who
ejected MR. GLADstone from Oxford; but we did not, think that he would
...; * a Black-guardian would eat humble pie until he had been made to
cau stick.
MR. BERKELEY flºº us a Ballot speech and motion, and as he brought in some
charges affecting the election of the Solicitor-General, the House listened—we
like personalities. But MR. Bovil L was more than a match for his assailants,
introduced a Tory Housemaid †. tradesmen, and got the laugh, which
is the Blue Ribbon of Chaff. The balloteers were 110, the open-voters 197. MR.
Mowbray, new º; answered for Government, and spoke
well. His name used to be Cornish, but he has none of that dialect.
MR. Hunt introduced a Bill for making colonial sovereigns legal tender here.
We mention it, as MATERFAMILIAs sometimes writes to ask us whether the grocer
and butcher “ have a right” (as the lady matically puts it) to take Australian
sovereigns, of which PATERFAMILIAs often gives her several. Any that those
tradesmen will not take we shall be happy to divide among Qur young men, if she
kindly drop them into the editorial box at No. 85, Fleet Street.
Wednesday. MR. CLAY made an admirable speech on withdrawing his Bill for
WOL. L.I. E
NTRODUCED by that |f.
the Educational Franchise: , He remarked upon the gen-
tlemanly practice, adopted by the paper representin §.
BRIGHT's views, of publishing, day after day, the list of
iberal Members who contributed to the overthrow of the
Reform Bill, and $. said, that “knowing the influence
under which that Journal was supposed to be, conducted,
he was not surprised at such unfair treatment.” No. But
Mr. Punch would affectionately put it to MR. BRIGHT,
who, when years shall have matured him, and taught him
moderation and conciliation, may not improbably serve his
country officially instead of scolding her offensively, whether
it will not be inconvenient to recollect that he did not in-
terdict a species of gibbeting which is scarcely a courteous
method of waging political war. M.R., BRIGHT should re-
member at least one-half of the worldly rule–treat your
friends as if they may some day be your enemies, and your
enemies as if they may some day be your friends.
MR. GLApstone, moved the Second Reading of the
Abolition of Church Rates Bill. MR. DISRAELI did not
object, as no more was to be done with it this Session,
but he objected to the º of the measure. . On this
understanding we talked away until a quarter to six.
Thursday. The LoRD, CHANCELLOR, brought in a Bill for
amending the Law of Extradition with France. . We have
not given up a single rascal since 1843, owing to the
cumbersome proofs required by our Magistrates. He
explained that no sort of political criminal could be handed
over under the measure, which was directed against
murder, attempts to murder, and fraudulent bankruptcy.
LoRD CLARENDoN approved the Bill, which has also been
approved by SIR THOMAS HENRY, a Beak in whom Punch
has the utmost confidence.
The late Home Secretary, SIR GEORGE GREY, and the
present Home Secretary, MR. WALPOLE, concur in think-
ing that the Crown accords Hyde Park to the }. for the
purposes of public recreation, and that a Reform meeting,
which one BEALEs had invited, did not come within that
definition. Therefore, SIR Richard MAYNE, had an-
nounced that the meeting must not take place in the Park
but that Government had no idea of opposing political
meetings where they could be held without public incon-
venience, or danger. Let us try to make it up to one
BEALEs by announcing that he also invites Reformers to
send him sixpence apiece, but we hope that he will not
brand all non-subscribers as Wile Caitiffs, because that
would not be civil. -
A Coal Commission has been appointed to inquire into
the question whether the supply will last our time. With
such men as Dr. Percy, Professor RAMsAy, SIR
RoDERIck MURCHIson, and MR. PRESTwich upon the
Commission, we think that it was very unnecessary for
MR. WALPole to assure the House that the Commissioners
were notČ. to bore. - -
LoRD CRANBoRNE, the new Indian Minister, produced
his budget, and even the most, spiteful of his critics is
obliged to declare that his speech was lucid, and that he
showed an appreciation of his subject. We hope that we
know our duty to the public better than to enter into any
details on such a topic as India—but we may mention that
she is prosperous and progressive.
MR. Miil put a long string of questions to the Govern;
ment on recent affairs in Jamaica. MR. DISRAELI replied
that the questions themselves, begged, the questions, at
issue, and were untruthful, that the Commission had repo
ably and impartially, that Gover Nor: EYRE's case was
concluded by his dismissal, that the Admiralty º.
of the conduct of our Admiral, and that the Horse-Guards
had not yet decided on its course. He could promise
nothing more. We may add, as part of the history, of the
Case, fi. a certain association wished, the widow. of
GoRDON to prosecute MR. Eyre, that she declined, alleging
that she had forgiven what had been done, but being re-
monstrated with, on the ground that her refusal tended to
embarrass the agitators, she placed herself.in the hands of
those persons. MR. Buxton withdraws from the business.
Mr. Punch, as the friend of the British Navy, learns with
leasure, not with surprise, that the charges against certain
nglish sailors, accused of ill-treating a woman in Jamaica,
have proved to be º; accusations against JACK, over
whose fame the cherub Punch watches with jealousy. The
lady appears to have had a strong admiration for the
service, and to have manifested it with Occidental non-
reserve.
MR. GLADstone fired off the last joint in the tail of the
Great Reform Cracker. He moved that the order of the
No. 1307.

what Government would do, but did not blame them for doing nothin
at present. He would support any good and effectual Reform Bill,

upon European affairs, and introduced an elegant Latin quotation

by sad circumstances, it was the duty of England to do something in
favour of falling Austria. LoRD DERBY was unconvinced, as was
LoRD Russell. - -
LoRD SHAFTESBURY expressed his joy that the Hyde Park º:
had been prohibited. He had held many meetings, and hoped to hol
more, but always at propertimes and places: .
In the Commons we talked of guns, Irish railways, and the Navy,
and then we had an interesting debate on Foreign Affairs. Non-
interference was pressed upon and promised by Lord STANLEY. SIR
G. Bowy ER, as a Catholic, was so severeupon France and Italy, that
Mr. Gians toº likened his utterances to those of the MARQUIs DE
Boissy, husband of
“The beautiful Countess or GUIccroll,
Who admired Lord Byron habitually.”
MR. GLAnstone reminded Government that England had the strongest
sympathy for Italy. The general tone of the debate showed that
whatever may have been the origin of the great war, or the motives of
its promoters, England looks with satisfaction to the establishment of a
#. strong, free Protestant Germany, both for its own sake and as
a er.

Very sorry, no ſº footman says that under-gardener tells him the

At Marlborough Street Police Court, on Wednesday last week,
there occurred a very shocking thing. A gentleman with a handle of
Honourable to his name was actually convicted of being drunk, and
furiously riding a horse in Rotten Row, Hyde Parks to the common
danger of the public, besides resisting the police in the execution of

POPULARITY OF THE NAVAL SERVICE.
MR. Punch,
It cannot, surely, be true that any difficulty is experienced by
the Admiralty in manning the Royal Navy. tely met with a
statement, somewhere, to the effect that, for several years past, the
annual enlistments in Her *::::" sea-service had fallen short of
the requisite standard by some 200, Pooh, Sir!, how is it possible to
believe such an assertion as that, when you read in the papers such a
paragraph as this?—
* BREACH or THE Forrior ENLISTMENT Act.—Considerable excitement was
created at Portland on Wednesday in consequence of the º: by HER MAJEsty's
ship Caledonia of the Chilian steamer Greatham Hall, having on board nearly 300
men who had been secretly enlisted for the purpose of manning a war vessel for the
Chilian Government.” y p
Hence it evidently appears that there is a glut of unemployed able:
ed seamen. The Queen's ships, so far from wanting hands, are all
full. There never, occurs a vacancy on board any one of them, even
for a cabin-boy, but it is instantly filled. , The fact is that the sailors
are all so ...' paid, so well accommodated, and so generously and
kindly treated, that there is an eager competition among sea-faring
men for employment in Her Majesty's service. berth amongst
the crew of a British man-of-war is the prize of a fortunate few com-
paratively. The rest are glad to take what service they can: They
must live, and, rather than starve, they are fain to hire themselves out
to fight the battles, of foreigners. , Necessity alone it is that drives
them to this..., Perish the thought that the mere temptation of higher
wages than the pay they could obtain, from, their own munificent
country could, induce them to accept, the office of assisting in the
slaughter of fellow-men not being enemies of their fellow-countrymen
For of course, villains, capable of killing, men for hire, are only re-
stra from g them for plunder by the penalty attached to
killing with intent to rob. Is not the motive by which a mercenary
soldier or sailor is actuated when he shoots, or stabs, or cuts his
*f; down, precisely the same as that which prompts a garotter
to throttle his victim f Anybody willing to enlist in a foreign army
or navy, for what he can get, would be j
be just as ready to knock you
on the head, Mr. Panch
- and rifle your pockets, Sir, if he had not
fore his eyes chiefly. the fear of the gallows, and next the dread
of infamy inc by illegal robbery and murder. -
The Foreign, Enlistment Act punishes the agents by whom British
subjects are enlisted on behalf of *** but it imposes no adequate
penalties, on the men who enlist... If, Mr. Punch, the British navy
Were ly under-manned, and if the treatment of the British sailor
were not in every respect quite what it ought to be, a suitable punish-
ment to inflict upon those rascals, with a view merely to punish them,
would be that to which smugglers used formerly to be sentenced-
service for a term of years on a man-of-war. But even though
the British naval service were still somewhat of the nature of pen
servitude, it would be too bad to insult the honest sailor, whose voca-
tion is the defence of his native land, by forcing upon him the society
of such messmates as a set of venal unfit to inhabit any sort of
ship but a hulk. It would be literally hire and salary, not punishment,
to thrust fellows of that sort into a navy wherein they would be so
much better of than they could in any other as they would in that
of England. . The supposition that any English seaman ever enters
the service of a foreign country unless from inability to get employ-
ment in his own, is too ridiculous almost to be mentioned by anybody
who knows what it is to be abaft the binnacle, not to say one who can
call himself AN OLD SALT.
P.S. There is said to be a want of candidates, for medical appoint-
ments in the navy. Fudge, Mr. Punch (, If all the competitors for
them obtained commissions, there would soon be almost as many
naval surgeons as sailors.

A PLEA FOR THE UNPROTECTED MALE.
To Mr. Punch.
EAR .MR. PUNCH,-I am a
mild man, of what my friends
are pleased to call a prepos-
sessing appearance, and of
what, I feel myself to be,
amiable and if anything, en-
; manners. . It has
hitherto been my innocent
impression that, whatever
attraction there may be in
my appearance, and whatever
amiability in my manners,
should be used for the good
of my fellow-creatures in re-
lieving the tedium of a short
railway journey which I am
compelled to take twice a
day, to and from my resi-
dence in the suburbs to my
lace of business in London.
'ill now, when I have seen
a carriage tenanted by a lady,
I have sought that carriage
in preference, having a natural, and, I hope, justifiable liking for the
society and conversation of what I have always been taught to consider
as the gentler and weaker sex. I do not blush to say that the prettier
the lady was, the more gratefully I have availed myself of her society, and
the more I have striven—within the limits of perfect propriety—to
make myself agreeable. , Without fatuousness, I believe I may say that
I have generally succeeded in leaving a pleasing impression on my fai
compagnon de voyage. I am quite sure that, as far as I am concerned,
a pretty face, a tasteful toilette, a delicately-gloved, hand judiciously
displayed, and a neat pair of ankles modestly managed, with occasional
snatches of remark such as grow readily out of the weather, the journey,
my little movements of courtesy, and so forth, have in a number of
cases, made what would have been, a half-hour of dulness over the
moruing paper, quite refreshing little episodes in my day. I have
sometimes even enjoyed my rai
railway journeys—thanks to such accompa-
niments! and, though not a forward man, have congratulated myself
secretly on the Inodest ease and engaging aplomb of manner, which
enabled me to turn these opportunities to account, for what, I believe
1 may safely call, mutual pleasure and innocent enjoyment of the hour.
I little thought, while thus employed, that I have all this time been
sporting ou the edge of a volcano, big with the elements of one of the
most serious, not to say disagreeable, criminal charges known to the
law. From recent cases, it seems that I might in any of these cases
have been charged for an indecent assault, and that ou such a charge–
provided only my journey had been en tête-à-téte—all my little attentions
all my well-bred agreeableness and graceful gallantry, all my prepos.
sessing points of appearance, might have been invoked against me as
evidence of the most confirmed ruffianism, the most abo.uinable vicious-
ness, and the most outrageous acts. I do not see how a man is to
defend himself against such a charge, if only the Circe or Dalilah
who brings it watches her opportunity, chooses her ground well, and
takes even the most shallow and obvious precautions against conviction.
Of course, if she won't even so much as scatter her bouquet, crumple
her dress, or ruffle her bonnet-strings, before charging her male coin-
panion with an act of brutal violence, there is still some chance for one.
But these little arrangements of the mise-en-scène will soon be under-
stood, and then what is to stand between men like myself, who may be
weak enough to feel a taste for ladies' society, and brave enough to
jº the taste deur-d-deuz in a railway carriage, and the crimi
Ock º'
1 pause for a reply, with my hair on end, and my cheeks in a glow
of anticipative terror.
For some time after MULLER's murder of MR. BRIGGs, elderly gen-
tlemen of a soporific turn, and in the habit of carrying carpet-bags that
looked like money, used to avoid entrusting themselves to a railway
carriage with a single companion.
If the Railway Companies allowed themselves to be bullied into
providing bull's-eyes between compartments, and means of signalling
between passengers and guards, in consequence of MULLER's crime,
how can they resist the demand for some provision to secure innocent
single gentlemen, especially persons like myself of old-fashioned gal-
lantry and prepossessing manners, against such charges as that lately
brought by MRs. or Miss ALLEN against MR. MURPHY, to name only
one case out of several * -
The difficulty is to suggest any possible protection or precaution,
as the charge is founded in nothing, what is, there to guard against P
The only course I can suggest—as it would be impossible, I sup-
pose to have a guard in every carriage—would be that either the
fair of Three Millions? Mr.
single ladies, or single gentlemen shall be committed to cellular com.
partments, such as those in the prison-vans.
As the charge always emanates from the ladies, I think they ought
tº be the parties,condemned to solitary confinement in transition.
Failing this, all railway W. in future, will have to be made—as
excursions to and from auxhall and Marylebone Gardens used to be
made in the days of JERRY ABERSHAw, in parties, for the sake of
mutual prºtectiºn, not from foot-pads, but from female extortioners,
who call, the police, and commit us to prison on a criminal charge, in
stead of being committed thither themselves.
I hope, dear Mr. Punch, you will insert this complaint, and give the
matter your best consideration. If §. do, of course you will get
something done, and so relieve from the constant danger the thousands
who might sign themselves with me,
ours, in grievous apprehension,
AN UNPROTECTED MALE.
MORE AMENDS FOR FLODDEN.
CERTAINLY we are, wopped, and why shouldn't we say so? The
histle has done it this time. ANGUs, CAMERON, a young Inverness-
shire man, has carried off, splendidly, the Queen's Prize, at Wimble-
don, and the Scottish Eight have borne away the International Shield.
Mr. Punch, who represents the United Kingdom, has, of course, no
jealousies, but heartily * the victory, and congratulates the
VictorS. Furthermore, he begs to state that Ireland in a slight and
England in an enormous º ought to be ashamed of themselves
respectively. We must trouble them with a few figures. By the last
Census the pºpulation of Scotland was 3,061,251. That of Ireland was
5,764,543. That of England and Wales, was 20, 60,925; , Now then,
taking the due proportion of men capable of makin bulls'-eyes, what
does the balance of º Millions say to º licked by the balance
unch thinks that the less said the better.

A GRACIOUS PERMIT.
INASMUcli as we, Punch, consider that our friend, John BALDw1N
Buckston E, has, in a meritorious manner, and with all such means as
the times can afford, worked in the interest of the refined Drama,
bringing forth the best pieces he could get, and casting them with the
best strength of his company:
And inasmuch as it is represented to us by advertisements that the
said John BALDw1N Buckstone takes his benefit and closes his theatre
in the Haymarket on Wednesday, the first of August next, when he
will address the public : . . .
We hereby give permission to all persons who can procure admission
on that evening, to visit the said theatre, and in our name to signify
to the said John BALDw1N Buxton, by plaudit, our approbation of his
past proceedings. -
Finally, we hereby authorise, and desire the said JoHN BALDw1N
Buckston E to come on to our Palace after the delivery of his speech,
bringing a legibly written copy of the same, upon which he shall recei-
our candid opinion, with other confections. {3&ANVI gº.

A SHAME TO ST. PANCRAS.
Those who ascribe any, utility to the Invocation of Saints will
perhaps be disposed to invoke a Saint, who presides over an important
E. in the North-west of London, to attend to the following extract
rom the Post, which concerns his good name:—
* Yesterday at the meeting of the Board of Guardians of St. Pancras-MR.
Chuschwanprin Rossow in the Chair—the House Committee presented a report
stating that the master had called their attention to the desirability of relieving the
sick wards of the workhouse by placing the convalescent male patients in the
middle ward of the new building.”
St. Pancras, when his attention is, directed to the foregoing state:
ment, will see that the workhouse of his parish wants not only a chape
for its chaplain's #. but also a chapel of ease for its sick wards.
Reading on he will learn that:—
“The committee having consulted with the medical officer of the workhouse upon
the subject, he stated that to carry out this arrangement it would require the
services of a paid nurse to take charge of the patients, and the committee recoun-
mended that the ward be appropriated as proposed by the master, and that a
paid nurse be eng. at the usual of 6s, per week (rising to 7 s. after six
months' º:#:. with kº. wº. an &#"
The benediction of St. Pancras will of course be conferred on the
master, the committee, and the surgeon of the parish bearing his name,
to which they, indeed, have done credit by their consideration for the
sick poor. But what will he think of the Board of Guardians when he
sees that—
“Mr. JENRINs objected to the *Pººl. of an extra paid nurse, and there-
fore moved that the consideration of the subject be postponed for three months.
After some di ion, the tion for the tp of the subject for three
months was then adopted by 6 to 5, the smalſ attendance of the guardians (who are
40 in number) being accounted for by the absence of many at the quarterly dinner
of the Burial Board."
At a meeting of Guardians of the St. Pancras poor—so to be called
with any truth only in a rhetorical sense, as not guarding them—out
of forty who ought to have met, twenty-nine are conspicuous by their
absence, or would be conspicuous if they were not an obscure sort of
Bumbles. These nine-and-twenty parochial humbugs, instead of mind-
ing their business, are engaged in stuffing their most ungodly digestive
organs with funeral baked meats at the quarterly dinner of the paupers'
Burial Board. St. Pancras will probably account them so many ghouls.
St. Pancras strengthen the EARL of DERby in his determination to
effect a Workhouse Reform ' That, at any rate, is a reform to partake
of whose benefit the flesh-and-blood qualification is a sufficient title.
In the meantime, by the help of St. Pancras, MR. GATHoRNE HARDy,
let us hope, will so i. improve the administration of the Poor Law as
to avert from flesh-and-blood such ills as neglected ulcers and bed:
1|sores, and the verminous abomination, and the cruelty, which it
now suffers from the parsimony of such Guardians who, by their
barbarous procrastination, have defied the resentment of St. Pancras,
and deserve any chastisement that he is able to inflict upon, them.
They will perhaps find out their mistake, one of these days, when, in
sickness and sorrow, they, in their turn, have the measures needful for
the relief of their misery adjourned to that day three months, or sine die.

Now the Miantonomoh has crossed the Atlantic, we shall have to

. By the time we have done that, the Americans will probably have
invented a diving-boat to destroy Miantonomohs by pinning torpedoes
to their bottoms. Or else, or also, they will have invented huge steam-
rams calculated to run Miantonomohs down, and sink them. The
Americans will doubtless be wiser than to throw away powder and
shot on experiments in gunnery on vessels that show but six inches
above the water.
It may be that the Americans will not invent the diving-boat and the
ram themselves. The American Government will º s buy the idea
of those contriyances of an Englishman who will have had the offer of
it rejected by his own.
hen we are provided with Miantonomohs, then, in the unfortunate
event of war between England and the United States, we shall be in a
position to cope with the Americans as at present armed. Before that
time, they most likely will have provided themselves with torpedo

-- QUR. Wague Correspondent, who has now joined our

important intelligence:–

I went down to see about the Italian Navy, and give you
some particulars. Your Special Military and his assistant
are muffs. They wouldn't come on board. I dressed my-
self in a cºcked hat, and, carrying a white flag, stood on
the shore. Not being acquainted with the Italian language
—that is, not having as yet acquired my usual fluency in it
-I sang to them extracts, from BELLINI, RossINI, and
DoNizºl, giving each of the selections as nautical atone
as possible. They encored two, and I bowed my acknow-
ledgments from my private shore. I asked them when
the fight was coming off, but it was kept very dark on
account of the authorities; the whereabouts, however,
could be ascertained at a noted house-of-call in the neigh-
bourhood. By the way, while I’m with the Italians I

THE ROMANCE OF CROQUET.
“You told me,” said my romantic young friend to me, “that I
should have lots of opportunities of saying sweet things to-to-Her.”
I, pointed out to him that he had had numberless opportunities at
Croquet. He had not seen it. I gave him some hints, and he owned
himself perfectly astonished at the facilities afforded for, serious flirta-
tion by this admirable game. “Give me,” he exclaimed, “a. Croquet
party, and the object of my affections, and my success is certain.
For the benefit of fluttering flirters I carefully observed the game,
and present the following account, dramatically rendered, to the notice
of young ladies and gentlemen, in order that they may know the diffi.
culties to be encountered in the pursuit of the interesting science of
Out-of-door-Flirting-in-Croquet-Company.

to say on the subject.) I hope I shall have better fortune than MR.

makes her first hoop triumphantly.) There !

How To clear THE PARK.
MR. PUNCH has received several admirable suggestions. If they
have arrived a little late they will do for any future emergency:—
1st Method. Let the park be filled with fire engines. Let the fire
engines play soap-and-water on the Great ūnwashed. Let the engineers
be very particular about the soap.
2nd Method. Put one of our leading tragedians in the park as Hamlet.
The moral effect of this would be marvellous. -
3rd Method. Keep it perpetually undermined with gunpowder.
(Slightly troublesome this, perhaps.) -
nº. ºut. Turn the animals from the Zoological Gardens loose into
the park.
A New Peer and an Old Joke.

A LETTER FROM AN OLD LADY.
DRAt them “Bears,” I say. Ireelly can’t a-bear'em.
It's all through them as I’ve been well migh worrited to
death. You know they partly caused the Panic by their
precious goings-on, and what that Panic’s been to me
in worry and wesation is more than you would guess.
The way as I’ve been worrited nobody would credit, and
they drained away my life's blood till Ireally got quite
empty, and had scarcely any circulation in my veins.
Pray, dear Mr. Punch, do try and stop folks from
a-spekkerlating as they have done, and a-gambling with
their money as isn't theirs in fact, but their customers'
wholends it'em. And do say a word to help the passing
of that Bank Act for to put a check upon the swind-
ling—I beg pardon, the selling of bank shares., Men
who sell a lot of property which they haven't purchased,
and then damage the same property that they may buy
it cheap, are animals whom Stock #º. zoologists

when Ithink of all the misery these beasts have been

P.S. Ruining a family, by breaking all the banks in
which its money is invested, is not yet made in England
an indictable offence. But it would serve’em only
right to pump. Apon the brutes. A notice of there
having, been “Another Fine Bear Watered!” might
certainly do something pour encourager les autres.
THE SACREDNESS OF OPEN SPACES.
THE right of holding º meetings in the open
air is one of those privileges of a Briton which every
true Conservative would, equally with every true
Liberal, desire to conserve. Only let them be held in
proper places, that is to say, where they are not cal-
culated to occasion a breach of the peace, or of windows
or of heads, and skins. What are those proper places
To be sure they are open spaces. Let the Legislature,
therefore, make due provision to prevent all open spaces
hitherto accessible to the Public in the neighbourhood
of large towns from being enclosed. For the purpose
of public meetings, the more remote their neighbour-
hood is from those towns, and especially from London,
the better.

COLUMBUS FOR THE CALENDAR.
The Roman correspondent of the Post says that:-
“An enthusiastic pamphlet has been addressed to the Pope by a French prelate,
ardently advocating the cause of Christophen Columbus as a worthy...candidate
for the honours of canonisation. The work has been translated into Italian, and is
creating a good deal of attention, but it is to be doubted whether the Congregation
of Rites and the “Devil's Advocate’ will waive such an essential condition for
canonisation as the documentary evidence of the candidate's having performed
three well authenticated miracles, although the author, whose name I cannot re-
collect at this moment—although I have ſooked through his pamphlet-declares
that Chatstophea Columbus performed a miracle greater than that of any other
Saint by discovering a new world and converting the inhabitants to Christianity."
The discovery, by Columbus, of a new world was probably as great
a miracle, and a miracle as well authenticated, as anyone ever º
and truly performed by any saint whom the Pope has canonise
There is one miracle.
Colgºpus's conversion of the new world which he had discovered
to Christianity, regarded as a fact, was no less miraculous; and if the
conversion is not a fact so generally motorious as the discovery, it is
et #º full as well authenticated as most of the miracles of which
is Holiness requires proof as a condition, to canonisation some three
centuries after the saint's decease. Well, there is miracle number
two. Wanted, miracle number three. What historical occurrence
can be more readily cited? The third miracle performed by CQLUMBus
of course was his making the egg stand upright. Let St. Vitus, or
St. Valentine, or St. Antony j. beat that. There are three
miracles for the Devil's Advocate and the Holy Father, to attest the
sanctity of Columbus; and if they are not satisfied with them, we
should like to know what sort of miracle, established upon what sort
of evidence, it is that they require.
AN ULTRA-LIBERAL SUBSCRIPTION.
We have much º in º that a subscription has been
opened to raise a fund for the repair of the windows and other property
damaged or destroyed during the late riot in Hyde Park. The name
of MR. Edmond BEALEs at the head of the subscription list, followed
by the names of his principal associates, of the Reform League, will
afford satisfactory proof that they repudiate the acts of the criminal
classes who took the opportunity which the meeting convened by that
confederacy afforded them, to gratify their savage, passions by ºut-
rageous and brutal violence. The appearance of the names of MR.
AYRTon, MR. John Stu ART MILL, and MR, LAYARD amongst the sub-
scribers, will also be hailed with ſº The numerical import-
ance of the Reform League will be forcibly illustrated by the amount
subscribed, should it, prove large enough to defray the expense of
replacing the Park railings.
Something Racy.
When the Horse-Eating Society dined together in Paris, we
wonder how many horse-d'oeuvres were consumed among the viands
and whether the horseflesh was served up à la carſ. A lunatic, frien
suggests that the toast of the evening should have been drunk in a
cheval glass.

When the Atlantic Cable is completed, it is a fact, that a message

ECONOMY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
MR. PUNCH,
RINGs, bracelets, necklaces, and other trinkets, made of
É. stones, gold, and silver, articles sold by a jeweller, have
litherto been denoted in the º by the word *jeweller .”
Some of your contemporaries have lately taken to substituting for that
word the word “jewelry.” Now, “jewel” and “gem” are convertible
terms. Jºy. Sir, do you think it would be proper to call gems
-- gemry >>
If we are to follow the fashion, regardless of º: let us at
least preserve the analogy of orthography. If, instead of “jewellery,”
we write “jewelry,” by parity of spelling we should in place of “sta:
tionery” put “stationry,” and, for “confectionery,” “millinery,” and
“drapery,” use “confectionry,”, “millinºy,” and “drapry.” et us
sacrifice...both orthography and etymology, to economy, in regular
style. Then, in each of the foregoing words, we save an e. Never
mind the consideration that we also clip the Queen's English.
Suppose we say “buffoonery,” then, we mean the practice of a
buffoon. What if we say “buffoonry P’’ The change of termination
would perhaps suggest a change of sense: of course we know that
there may be some sense in buffoonery even. Buffoonry might be
taken to mean, a set of buffoons, amongst, whom the innovators who
affect the word “jewelry” are welcome, if they please, to class your
humble Servant, FITz-DILWORTH.
Rough and Ready.
A Good º: the roughs who rioted in Hyde Park at the Reform
Demonstration have been sentenced to imprisonment. Quod est demon-
strandum by such a demonstration is, that the demonstrators may be

SONG BY A MAIMED SOLDIER,
STUMP, sole remaining fraction
Of good leg crushed in action;
#. on thee despairing,
ſy sad heart fury tearing.
I mourn no limb that, fighting,
I lost, in war delighting,
For hire, or loot, campaigning,
Of just desert complaining.
For Fatherland defended,
The thought that 'twas expended,
Had been some consolation
For grievous amputation.
But in a herd, like cattle,
A Conscript driven to battle,
Stump, yon old King's ambition,
Brought me to this condition.
Ah, no more lightsome gambols'
No wood or mountain rambles'
More hope in this world, never !
Gone, all joy, gone for ever !
O º thus to linger!
I’d not have sold a finger
For all the world's vain glory,
And fame in song and story.
Could º honour please me,
There's little to appease me.
A one-legged soldier passes
Observed—as a lame assis.
Wreck that I am, and ruin!
Would all war-makers knew in
Their sweet selves the prival ion,
The woe of mutilation |
For Heaven itself, a martyr
Would groan his limb to barter.
For man's pride, by a quarter,
O wretched me, cut shorter
THE RIOT “ACT.”—Closing the Park-gates.
HOSPITAL TEACHING.
WALKING the hospitals is a most salutary, practice... It not merely
teaches healing, but, rightly undertaken, it refines the mind. The
sight of suffering induces pity and compassion, and a wish to proffer
help; and these .#. improve and elevate the thoughts.
; the minds of Kings and Emperors at all need to be refined Is
the sight of human suffering at alſ likely to improve, them.” Then let
their Majesties go forth, and walk the hospitals a while, and be softened
in their mind by the agony they witness. Would monarchs shrink
from war, if they saw the cruel i.;; it surely must produce?
Then let them pay a visit to the villages of Germany, and see the thou-
sands of poor creatures who are lying torn and tortured by sabre-cut
or bayonet-thrust, or wound by shot or shell. Would not their pride
be somewhat humbled at the sight of all the misery it may have helped
to cause *, And would they, being human not the less, for being royal
or imperial, not be softened in their hearts by the sufferings they wit:
... and be evenied to think that glory or dominion is purchased
far too dearly at the horrid cost of war?
RHYMES TO A RITUALIST.
FRIEND. Ritualist, how can a cope
Encourage any Christian's hope P
And what advantage hath a stole
To render his immortal soul?
Aught can a chasuble conduce
To any spiritual use?
In what way can an alb relate
To §: s future state P
Or atics concern hereafter ?
No more expose thyself to laughter.
WHEN does aboy begin bird-keeping When he first sets up a (h)owl.

“It has been stated that MR. Beales lost his watch, and to this
we may add that the same “patriot’ or some friend also “annexed'

..Let us trust that MR. BEALEs sustained no losses of the

culate among the weak and excitable classes. The Qther day, however,

It did not refer to a commercial failure. The announcement com-
mencing with it was found to be “Suspension of Hostilities.”

THE Improved Industrial Dwellings Company have recently com;
leted another of their blocks of buildings for the accommodation of

of this immense class should do for the Company's project what they
do for the dwellings they raise—ventilate, it well; and make widely
known an undertaking in which all may take a share (yielding, too, a
fair profit), without any sacrifice of political principles, although the
buildings are divided by a party-wall, and the scheme may be hopefully
regarded as a radical cure for some of the plagues of this swarming
town.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCHPS ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
WINDLING away, but
doing its duty, Par-
liament met, for its
last complete week,
on Monday, July 30.
The progress of the
cholera was the very
melancholy subject
before the Lords. In
the metropolis alone
the rate of mortality
had doubled, the in-
crease being solely
due to this scourge.
The Commons, how-
ever were doing what
they could in the
way of legislation for
the public health,
and, as yet, the Lords
had only to speak of
atheological remedy,
which is applied in
an awkward way.
The Prayer has, un-
happily, become an
anachronism, but my
Lords the Bishops
will doubtless rectify
this.
ALDERMAN LAW-
RENCE demands that
Waterloo Bridge
shall be opened
free, for the benefit
of the many who
will be ejected by the clearance for the Temple of Justice. Govern-
ment had no intentions to announce. Later, it was mentioned that
the Architects, who are stated to be fully, informed, of the requisi-
tions of Law, are to send in their designs by the 15th of December.
We recommend as mottoes for the competitors, “Astrata Redur,”
“The Virgin and the Scales,” “The Oyster,” “Fee-Farm,” “Causes
produce Effects,” “Glorious Uncertainties,” “Agree with thine Adversary.”
MR. O'BEIRNE was informed º: EcRETARY FOR IRELAND that
MR., Joseph, NAPIER does not believe that his infirmity, deafness,
would prejudice public interests, but as the reverse impression has
been produced, he declines judicial office. MR. NAPIER's course is
so graceful and honourable that Mr. Punch scorns to hint that a certain
marvellous Cartoon may have had any influence. The picture has evi-
dently not been seen by CHIEF JUSTICE BLACKBURN.
The Weather Office will probably be re-modelled. We mention the
announcement chiefly that we may express a hope that the subscription ||
for the family of ADMIRAL FITZRoy, who died in doing his duty—and
more—to the nation, is still being increased. John BULL is easily
stirred to an instant generosity, but his memory is not of the best.
Touching Fortifications, about the true principle whereof we seem
to be nearly as much in the dark as ever, it is satisfactory to state that
Government abandons a plan for taking £50,000 for the defences of
Chatham and Tilbury. At the same time, it would be agreeable to
have a few guns mounted in the very pleasant garden of the Rosher-
ville Hotel, as, after a good dinner, under the direction of MR. WATEs,
it would be rather amusing to play upon the passing craft; and these |i
are days when all rational entertainments should be encouraged. .
Public Health and Reformatory Schools occupied us until two in
the morning, and we had a little Protestant row about Popish sponsors, P
who are thought to baptise infants, ...; into the Catholic
Church. We hope that they make amends by liberality in regard to
apostle spoons and ivory-clad missals.
Tuesday. A Currency Debate. MR. DISRAELI has well remarked in
one of his sparkling novels, that the subject of Currency, which most
concerns everybody, is the subject, therefore, about which nobody
knows or cares anything. He had to sit out a long debate in refuta-
tion of his theory. We shall certainly not º: the speeches. But
with Two Hundred Companies in a state of smash, and with Bank
discount at £10 per Cent, it is hard lines for those who have not, like
Mr. Punch, cellars groaning with gold. The debate was adjourned,
like the consideration of a good man º: just now.
Then we had a Jamaica Debate. Briefly, every humane person de-
plores the excesses that were committed under martial law, and every
jº. gives, MR. EYRE all credit for the vigour with which he
acted, and which saved Jamaica. It is clear that GoRDON, was a
seditious and dangerous person, who might possibly have been hanged
by a regular tribunal, but it is equally clear that he was hanged on
insufficient eyidence. Several individuals have still to answer to the
law in Jamaica, and thus the matter should stand, for the present.
MR, RUSSELLGURNEY, who acted so ably as Commissioner in Jamaica,
spoke in the debate, and stated that the origin of the rebellion was a
general desire, by the blacks to become the possessors of lands. . For
saying this he has, of course, been horribly aſ: by the Negrophiles,
but what, better testimony can be had than that of an English Judge,
who has heard the evidence? The House rejected all the resolutions
proposed by the Jamaica Committee, except one which embodied the
expression of regret that all must feel. The Committee threaten to
rosecute MR. EYRE, and are touting for subscriptions for the purpose.
his will |. a re-action, and Mr. Eyre .# be presented with a
sword of honour. Does the Laureate sing in vain against the False-
hood of Extremes?
hºedºesday was given to MR. GLApstone's Bill for the Abolition of
Church Rates. The Government object to it, on principle, but did not
% the Second Reading, as nothing more is to be done this Session.
r. Punch seldom quotes, in this page, but will call attention to a Sign
of the Times. Read these eloquent lines, which refer to the debate —
“Englishmen know too well the services which the Church has rendered, to
wish for her decline. She has given us the finest theological literature in the world;
her clergy have in every age been renowned for their scholarship, their eloquence,
and their goodness; she has been the home of piety and tolerance, the haven of
rest to many a storm-tossed soul; and while culture has, generation after genera-
tion, accepted her divine guidance, she has . atically been the Church of the
poor. To maintain the stability of such a Church, no exertion should be spared;
and the bulk of the nation have no sympathy with the iconoclasts who assail her
with sacrilegious hands. She will retain her hold over the hearts of the people so
long as she is adequate to the fulfilment of her office.”
You admire both the sentiments and the language. So do we. But
whence, come they? Not, of course, from the Record, for . no
uncharitable taunt is in them, besides, the phrases will bear parsing.
Nor are they from the Defender of the Faith, our friend the Standard.
They are from the Daily Telegraph, an ultra-Liberal organ. , Who, in
his senses, will say that men have not become more thoughtful and
tolerant than their fathers? Would a radical writer have dared to say
this to radical readers twenty-five years ago?, And you owe the change
to the teaching of the First Gentleman of the Universe, Mr. Punch.
He is not changed—his soul is like a star and dwells apart—but you
all are; and you know it. Let us liquor.
In the evening the Lord Mayor feasted the Ministers. Let us say
for LQRD PHILLIPs that he has not only done all the hospitalities of
his office splendidly, but has also done them gracefully, and with such
oratory as is too seldom heard from the Fathers of the City. This is
not the gratitude which is defined as a }} sense of future favours,
as, in the first place, it is a favour on Mr. Punch's part to dine with
anybody, and, in the second, he accepts no more invitations this season.
The Ministers spoke well, having nothing to say, and the Mayor
quoted LoRD DERBY’s Homer to his Lordship, which was a meat
compliment.
Thursday, SIR STAFFORD NoFTHgoTE, the Board of Trade, was
asked whether anything would one by Government in case the
creditors of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway should come
own on the lines and hut out the public. Sir Sºroro did not
think there was any danger. Nor can Punch imagine that even
creditors would be such asses. But really, if a Company is to have
enormous powers, destroy whole suburbs, and get people into a habit
of using certain conveyances, protection against creditors, should be
anted, not for the sake of the speculators, but of the public., Fanc
the shock to a Swell, hastily han his shiny bag to supposed guard,
and telling him to put it into a carriage and lock the door, as he
wanted to smoke, and then, in return for his half-crown, (accepted,
of course) hearing from a Sheriff's Officer the words, “ Can't do no
ocking up here, Sir, but if you’ll step up to Cursitor Street, I can
oblige.”
§. MILL presented a petition complaining of the closing of the
ark Gates against the Reform Meeting, and condemning the conduct
of the Police. The charges are perfectly distinct, and we regret to
see them amalgamated, as Mr. Punch has taken great pains to illustrate
the difference between the Artisans and the Roughs. The complaint
of the former is on a question of law, that of the latter—we are º
to say a well-founded one,—is that their ruffianism received an instal-
ment of the punishment it deserved. - -
Government asked for leave to continue the Suspension of the
Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, and it was of course granted. -
MAGUIRE, MR. O'BEIRNE, and MR. BERNAL Osborn E made very good
tº: however, and in so far as they affirmed that reform in
the Hibernian land-system was needed, Mr. Punch is heartily with
them. But we can have no mob-law, on either side, the Irish Sea.
Much Fenian ammunition was seized at “Limerick Prodigious,” on
the very day of the debate.
Friday. In the Lords there was a little wrangle between Lords -
Russell, and DERRY, about the state of Hyde Park. The public is
concerned only with the facts that there is an idea of introducing police

Whereunto, any time,
If you’re asked for a º:
You may answer, “Remember the Grotto.”
Shortly after July,
Children tease passers-by,
In a way the young wretches ought not to;
Every brat whom you meet,
Boy or girl, in the street,
Crying, “Please, Sir, remember the Grotto.”
“Grotto! I'll grotto you,”
Roar old gentlemen, who
Say more definite cannot find what to ;
“Go along—get you gone!”
But they only keep on
Saying, “Please, Sir, remember the Grotto.”
What a nuisance and bore,
To be dunned evermore
By those fi. as though you’d forgot to
read that trial severe,
Once too often a year
When they bid you “Remember the Grotto!”
How they get in your way,
And your progress delay!
One would think 'twas a regular plot to
Make you frantic designed,
Drive you out of your mind,
Importuned to remember the Grotto.
With their oyster-shells pressed
In the front of your chest,
You, distracted, desire the whole lot to
Be off–go to the deuce!
'Tis of not the least use:
They keep on, “Please remember the Grotto.”
Interrupting the thread
Qf your musing, your head
They confound, by your sides as they trot to
Plague you out of your pence
On that idle pretence,
That appeal to “Remember the Grotto.”
'Tis when oysters come in
That this game they begin; .
For “an R in the month” 's not their motto;
Oh the maddening pest
Of that constant request—
“O Sir, Please Sir, remember the Grotto!”

And whose pound-foolishness arms my hand.

has been somewhat puzzled by the perusal of the
{eform meeting at the Agricultural
porters contradicted one another as flatly as sailors in a salvage case,
- - - His only course seems to be to present two
all. The re-
accounts, and leave posterity to reconcile their slight discrepancies.
“The “Reformers' had another series
of “demonstrations' last night. The
“gatherings' consisted chiefly of boys,
roughs, and idlers. The banners were
gen erally of the shabbiest description;
and the principal flag bore the legend
of ‘GLAdston E and Manhood Suffrage.”
Although large placards stigmatising the
affair as a “great Donkey show ' were
hoisted, “horse play' and rough practical
jokes were the order of the evening. A
number of enthusiastic Reformers, who
had paid half-sovereigns for places on the
platform, were disgusted to find that
* the people' had asserted their whole
‘sovereign rights' and taken posses-
sion without pay. MR. Brales found
no chair leſt for him to take. After
an effort to get a hearing, which was
not very successful, MR. Mason Jon Es
was the first *: but he, car-
ried away by his own enthusiasm,
quite forgot that MR. STUART Mill,
M.P., was waiting to follow, and Mr.
Jones had to be pulled down by the coat
tails. Then MR. Mill, of whose speech
not a word was audible, gesticulated for
some minutes so ludicrously that the
mob left off shouting to laugh at his
grotesque appearance. The hon, member,
who seemed quite bewildered with the
hubbub, left in a hurry, in order to
describe in his place in Parliament this
orderly and majestic demonstration of
the people. A free fight followed ; the
reporters' table was smashed, and the
scene of confusion and misrule which ſol-
lowed must be left for the imagination.”
Conservative Report.
“Such an indoor meeting as London
itself never before witnessed was held last
night in the Agricultural Hall. At least
forty thousand must have been present;
for not only were the area, the organ-loft,
and the side galleries absolutely crowded,
but listeners swarmed upon the iron
beams and girders of the edifice, and
many were festooned along the gigantic
ribs which support the roof. The re-
ports describe to us, indeed, a marvellous
spectacle. The faces of forty thousand
men turned to one point, with one object,
silent together, shouting with agree-
ment together, unanimous in cheers that
roll like thunder, and in hisses that
sound like the menace of some monstrous
snake. * * * The scene presented by
this vast concourse was one which no
one who witnessed it will ever forget.
Those who are fond of comparing MR.
MILL's present position with that which
he occupied before he had proved that the
greatest living sage was capable of sus-
taining himself in the turbulent element
of popular politics, and of winning from
the populace the admiration he had long
enjoyed amongst the highly educated of
his countrymen, might well have felt a
thrill of curious excitement bad they
seen the distinguished man's colossal re--
ception by this vast assemblage. * * *
There never yet was held in the world so
great a meeting, and in this dictum we
are pleased to have the concurrence of a
gentleman second to none in his acquain-
tance with the great mass meetings for
which America is celebrated.”

A PICTURE OF INTELLIGENCE,
THE following is a reporter's portrait of a gentleman as he appeared
before a coroner's jury charged with murder?—
“The prisoner is of short stature and short build. He has a round bullet head,
thick neck, small dark eyes, and peculiarly *...*.* bcetle brows. His de-
meanour was throughout dogged and indifferent, but there was nothing in his
appearance to indicate an absence of a low order of intellectual faculty.”
There is an obscurity in the conclusion of the foregoing extract,
3. occasioned by a misprint. The statement that the prisoner's
emeanour was dogged and indifferent is not clearly qualified by the
counterpoised, remark, “but there was nothing in his appearance to
indicate an absence of a low order of intellectual faculty.” Why
“but”? Of course there, is nothing in the appearance of any one
whose demeanour is º and indifferent to indicate an absence of a
low, as contradistinguished from a high, order of intellectual faculty.
It is conceivable that, on the cont
intellectual faculty might be indicate -
appearance. But then again a dogged and indifferent demeanour is
compatible, enough with intellectual faculty of a high order. If we
were told that a person's demeanour was dogged and indifferent, but
that there was nothing in his appearance to indicate an absence or a
low order of intellectual faculty, we should then know that we were
given to understand that his appearance, for all his doggedness and
indifference of demeanour, did not betoken an absolute idiot or even a
very stupid man. Is this the opinion which the physiognomist above
quoted intended to express as to the prisoner whose personal charac:
teristics, were a round bullet head, thick neck, small dark eyes, and
º overhanging beetle brows? Did he mean to represent the
individual of whose appearance such were the distinctive specialties as

AN INDEFINITE FLUNKEYISM.
A FASHIonABLE. reporter, in his
account of a marriage between the
son of a peer and the daughter of a
baronet, performed by a bishop, the
other day at a church in Piccadilly,
says that after the marriage had been
registered, the wedding party, ad-
journed to the house of the bride's
papa, “where a sumptuous breakfast
awaited them.” He omits, however,
to state the particulars of the break-
fast which he calls sumptuous. He
does not tell us whether or no that
º breakfast comprehended
any luxuries more expensive than new:
laid eggs, ham, cold beef, rashers, and
sausages. In the opinion of one who
has had experience enough to be a
competent critic, of wedding-break-
fasts in the world of fashion, what
things are necessary to constitute a
sumptuous breakfast?, Doubtless, in
relation to the digestive organs, and
the nutritive function, a great many
unnecessary things. But different
people have different ideas of sump-
tuousness. Skilled workmen of a
certain class, in receipt of high wages,
have been known habitually to make
their breakfast qm ducks and port
wine. This is a breakfast that would
be deemed sumptuous by many a peer.
In the course of a legal investigation
some time agº, a witness, who had
been the familiar cad of a sporting
man, employed the word “sumpshus.”
In º: of certain repasts. that
had been partaken of by himself and
others concerned in the case. Being
requested to specify the sort of fare
that he considere *: he
named rumpsteaks. This ascetic
would probably have esteemed eggs-
and-bacon sufficient to constitute a
sumptuous breakfast, and have even
lºoked upon that meal as worthy of
that epithet if inclusive of bloaters.
The majority of poor curates, we may
be sure, would account a breakfast
comprising hot rolls extravagantly
sumptuous, and there is reason to fear
that there are too many of them in
whose estimation a breakfast would be
rendered sumptuous by the addition
of butter.
FRESH GAME FOR MR. PUNCH.
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN ?
We are not, very often, so utterly
helpless as we feel in the presence
of this invitation:-
DVANTAGEOUS to PARENTS.
—A Lady who is educating the daughter
of a clergyman, formerly head master of a
Cathedral School, and now Vicar of a Count
Parish, has the privilege of INTRODUCIN
a YOUNG GENTLEMAN, who will receive
a superior education on very liberal terms.
Address H. O., &c.
HO, indeed. In fact, we may (and
do) say, Ho! hol. But, seriously,
what does it mean?, The primáſ.
impression is, that the Tex-school.
master's daughter is a beautiful and
wealthy little lady, , and that the
parents of some eligible little gentle-
man are invited to secure so desirable
a match for their son. The teacher
is “privileged” to say this, The
word is obscure... .It is used by a
certain class of religionists when they
only mean that they have got a bit of
§. But it may imply that the little
lady's papa has authorised the an-
nouncement. We are quite at sea in
the matter, and to our previous
remark, Ho! ho! we are only, as yet,
able to add, Hee, hee, and a delicate
hint that the advertisement may have
attractions for the class whose utter-
ances are akin to Hee haw.
Conversation and Conversion.
WHAT different tastes men have,
and what different things men talk
about! Some bore you with their talk
on the Conversion of the Jews, while
others small-bore you by º of
the Conversion of the Enfields. Just
now the latteris by far the more usual
theme for chatter, and at every public
dinner somebody is sure to make a
speech upon the subject, and become
for half an hour or so a sort of
“ENFIELD's Speaker.”
CLASSICAL,
DID the old Romans play billiards?
Very possibly they did, to judge from
the § saying, “a cue tºtipisti.

A NEW ERA FOR THE DRAMA.
By all means let us have Continuations. We do not refer to that
portion of the masculine wardrobe which is lº put on before the
vest and the coat; far be it from us to assert that the men of England
need any advice to eschew Highlanderism. We allude to Continuations
of Plays. When an author has invented a series of characters, an
has worked out a plot, why should not another author steal his charac-
ters, and taking such hints for a second story as he can obtain from
the first, put the old lot on the stage?, It is much easier than original
º The experiment has lately been tried, and though the
intellectual deficiencies of the second author seem to have caused the
result to be a Mull, another effort in the same line may be
luckier. We, suggest that at Drury Lane Theatre, about to
open for the legitimate drama, the novel expedient should be re-
sorted to, and we learn from good authority that another aspiring
young dramatist has submitted to MR. CHATTERTON a Continuation of
Othello. It is called, The Moor of Kenice, or a Year Aſter. We all knºw
the end of the SHAkspeaRIAN play. Othello stabs himself, and falls.
The second SHAKSPEARE has supposed, that, owing to a want ºf Anatº-
mical knowledge, Othello missed a vital part and slowly recovered. Iago is
tortured to death before the audience, and Emilia, who was but slightly
wounded, becomes, of course, a widow, and resolves to marry Othello,
who, as lago states, had, before the opening of Fº No. 1, paid her
marked attentions. But Bianca, who, breaks, with Casio, on a count
of his having become a confirmed drunkard, is Emilia's rival. and
moreover turns out to be an unrecognised daughter of Brabantio, by
whose death she has become rich. e do not propose to injure the
success of the piece by detailing the progress of the plot, but all ends
happily, and the grand scene at the end where othelio, now Doge of
enice, goes on the “Canal” to perform the celebrated ceremonial of
the Marriage of the Waters, will demand all MR. BEVERLEY’s best
energies to do it justice. The theatrical public may be congratulated
on the new device for its entertainment.

. J. A. SMITH most properly asked MR.HARDY whether Parliament ought to separate
without providing the means of summary interference, where vestries or others shoul
neglect their duty in regard to sanatory measures at this crisis. MR HARRY promised
a f. Bill, next year, for dealing with such subjects, hoped that the new Health Act would
do good, and distinctly said that Local Authorities were now On Their.Trial, and that
if they failed, their powers must be transferred. As they certainly will fail, we advise
that He new Biſbe framed on the basis that they have done so.
MR. DARBY GRIFFITH is uneasy about the designs of France or Italy, but Lord STANLEY
was unable to make any answer to the question of the honourable and uneasy gentleman.
It is a comfort that semper vigilat in aede Lar, Darbius.
We agreed with MR. WATKIN that it was inexpedient to talk any more abºut Currency.
MR. GILPIN hoped that the Government would consider the su . deeply during the

information that a Bank §. is nothing but a Mint Certificate, and when we say Mint, we

that she will have enough to do for a month at least in putting things straight. But go to
work, SIR John. -
The Indemnity Bill was passed. The law ordains that a lot of oaths shall be taken by all
sorts of persons, and by way of illustrating the value it sets on such profane nonsense, it
always steps in at the end of a Session with an intimation that if the oaths have not been
taken “it is of no consequence.” The farce ought to be called the Toots Act.
Also the Extradition Bill was passed. LoRD STANLEY had †. of it, and MR. MILL
said that if his Lordship were always to be Foreign Secretary, no further security against the
mis-use of that law could be wanted, but “as we were not likely to be always so favoured”

Tuesday. That discreet and venerated nobleman, Lorp WesTMEATH, made, complaint to
LoRD DERby touching Ritualistic practices. To him the Earl gravely replied, that the
business concerned the Bishop of LoNDoN, who was absent, but that such practices were
to be deprecated, as mischievous, although no doubt the Church allowed much latitude to
her priests. By the way, when the Bishops shall, have extinguished the Candles on the
Altars, some indignant Ritualist will probably exclaim (if such persons can understand
Pope) that the poet's prophecy is ed, and
“Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires.”
The Commons met for the last night of debate. MR, WALPole vindicated MR. Knox
the Magistrate, for a . which he had given in a º: Park riot case, and who had
well remarked to a complainer, “Do not blame a constable for a chance blow, but blame
those who turned the scum and refuse of the town on its peaceable inhabitants.” As Mr.
Punch has already signified, the feeling of all lovers of order is with the excellent Beak who
is so savagely abused by the friends of Roughianism. -
There was not much to amuseus, except a hope by MR. AYRTON, when the Public
Schools Bill was withdrawn, that we should soon abandon unsuccessful attempts to teach
the classic, languages to, the Middle Class.
Gracious, what a tyrannical and exclusive wish!
Shall only the haughty aristocrat read Horace,

WHO WRITES THE TIME-BOOKS P
DEAR PUNCH,
- You know everybody; pray do you know the author of the
railway time-tables and time-books? Because, if so, I wish you would
just tell him, with my most respectful compliments, that I wish he
would be earlier in sending in his “copy” for those interesting works.
Trains usually are changed upon the first day of the month, and the
time-books as a rule are never ready to be º till the morning
of that day. To be of service, then, they clearly should be issued a
week earlier, so that one may lay one's plans beforehand for one's
Journeys, and be saved from the annoyance of arriving at a station
just in time to be too late. - -
I travel a good deal, and have spoilt a splendid temper º:
trains which I have, missed by not, having a time-book, there being
none procurable until the day on which the times are altered for the
trains. The mysteries of a time-book are not easy to unravel, and on
this account, alone, if for no other reason, the time-books should be
issued considerably, before their information is required. Just touch
up the talented author who employs his time in writing them, and bid
him be in time in . us the times, and thus save from countless
miseries your tormented, WAGABUNDUs.
Animal Instinct.
THE Sea-Bear has whispered to his friend and Keeper that the grief
he feels at the death of the Sea-Cow on its passage to England and
the Zoological Gardens (which the Seal broke to him), is not unbear-
able. The creature is supposed to have been alarmed for the popu-
larity he now enjoys—to have felt it was fishy.
INTERESTING TO SMOKERS.
A NovE, is announced, called Brought to Light. It may be very
good. And we know many that are certainly as fit to be made Spills.
A SAND-PIPERS’ WHISTLE.
IN its largest type, as indeed, befits the terrible occasion, MR.
BRIGHT’s j. inserts the following frightful announcement from
a Correspondent, DR. SANDPIPER, of Kars:–
“I firmly believe that under the present Government the lives of such men as
MR. BRIGHT and MR. BEALEs are unsafe, and I am confirmed in this belief by sundry
observations I hear in society.”
Unhappily, we are enabled to confirm the terrors of the writer. We
had been disposed to give a contemptuous toleration to the existing
Cabinet, which is but temporary, because we think, with the late DUKE
OF WELLINGTON, that it is generally the duty of a good citizen to
support the QUEEN’s Government de facto. But we now denounce
that Government, and swear to do our utmost for its overthrow. It
seeks the lives of BEALEs and BRIGHT. We are in possession of facts.
LORD DERBy has sworn by St. Joan (a family oath, referring to his
aneestress, Joan of § that he will eat no pheasant of 1866 until
he has received the head of BEALEs at Knowsley, carriage paid, and no
fee to porter. We need not say what this means, when uttered in the
hearing of remorseless sycophants. Several attacks have already been
made upon MR. BEALEs, and though he has been hitherto providen:
tially, unharmed in consequence of the thickness of his skull, who shall
say that this will always be proof against the ruffianism of the blood-
thirsty scions of aristocracy? THOMAS A BECKETT fell in the Canter-
bury Cathedral, and BEALEs may be destined to a like fate in the
Canterbury Hall. Ultor et Ossibus, as, MR. GLADSTONE says, may
arise, but even if Bones should jump down from among the other
Ethiopians, and revenge BEALEs in the most sanguinary manner, what
atonement is this to a bereaved nation ? But BRIGHT is not destined
to succumb to the private vengeance of the haughty Lord of Derby.
An impeachment, with a packed majority in the Houses, is to send
BRIGHT to the block.
“The House impeach him, CoNINGsby harangues.”
. Yes, the malice of MR. DisrAELI is at length to be satiated. His
imaginative eye already sees the end, the shouted verdict, the awful
sentence, the dreadful array on Tower Hill. He hears the toll of St.
Peter ad Wincula. He beholds WILBERForce vainly trying to induce
the faithful Quaker to give some sign of attachment to the Church of
England, if it be only to bless a beadle. He sees WHALLEY, in his
Protestant mask, preparing the axe for the deadly enemy of all
Jesuitism. He marks ODGER weeping, Ropg|ERs, in convulsions,
BUBB bellowing for a rescue, and GILL trembling lest his own dark
doom be near. Then, with a face calm as young †. when led to
the stake, the Oriental Minister turns to the savage CAIRNs, and bids
him, at the peril of his own life, be sure that the forms of law are dº
observed. But the hatred of the tyrants may yet be baffled. We te
them to their cruel faces that their prey may foil them yet. It can do
no harm, now, to reveal, that BEALEs may pass at any moment through
Temple Bar in the disguise of an organ-grinder, and no minion of
MAYNE shall detect the patriot; or that MR. BRIGHT fishes peacefully
in a secret salmon stream while Disºrii rages and thirsts for his
blood. Yet the warning is well given, HUMPHREY of Kars, Corre-
º of the Star. Well whistled, HUMPHREY SANDFIPER, and the
observations we hear in society, touching thee, would well reward thee
for thy noble patriotism.
THE EPITAPH OF THE SESSION.
AUGUST 10, 1866.
HERE lies the Session that has ended,
Whereof “the least said soonest mended.”
It talked a deal about Reform,
And lashed itself into a storm,
That nigh wrecked GLADSTONE's reputation,
Lifted Lowe high, and bored the nation :
BEALEs and his roughs brought 'bout our ears,
And moved a WALPoLE's pious tears.
Turned out the measures and the men
That now we are calling for again:
And gave us men, who can’t pass measures,
Nor serve our profits or our pleasures.
Six hundred M.P.'s six months' skill
It used and hardly passed a Bill.
Sic transit, to the Banks of Sys,
Session no-Session, Sixty-six
Tell us, in a Word,
WHEN the Park rascals come—what they ought to get—and who
ought to deal with them?
ox—knocks–KNox.

be ready to go
into the water
in pursuit
− their favourite
amusement and
business at any
hour. I believe
they sleep in
their boots. -
First Morning,
after breakfast-Put on my landlord's big boots and walk in, the
meadow. M in a small boat fishing; ask him, ciyilly what, he's
doing. He answers, without taking, his eye of his hook, and being
disturbed, he answers gruffly, Dibbling for chub.” -- - - -
. I watched him dibbling. Dibbling appears to consist in sitting still
in a boat and holding a rod with the line not touching the water.
fish to be caught by dibbling must be a fool, as he has to come four
inches nearly out of the water in order to get at the bait. Luxurious
fish they must be too! epicures of fish, for the bait, is a bumble, or
humble, bee. The moral effect on a Dibbler is to make him uncommonly
sulky. All the villagers dibble, and are all more or less sulky;
End of First Hour of ºf the man dibbling for Chub.-Man
never spoke; no fish. He is still dibbling. -
End of Second Hour.—I have been watching him; one chub came
to the surface. He wasn’t to be dibbled; man still dibbling.
End of Third Hour.—I fancy I’ve been asleep;, the man faded away
from me Fº I am awake, and he is still dibbling for chub.
End of Fourth Hour.—I begin to feel hungry, I, ask him if he's
going, to leave off for luncheon; he shakes his head once, and goes
on dibbling. Much dibbling would soon fill Hanwell
Weil.
Fifth Hour.—I have had luncheon and sherry; I come down, the
meadow in the landlord's boots. Man still dibbling; no chub., I think
I will amuse him with a joke, which I have prepared at luncheon....I
say, jocosely, “What the dibble are you doing?” He answers, with-
out taking his eye away from his line, “I’ll punch your 'ed, if you
ain't quiet.” I try to explain that it was only a joke, and beg him not
to be angry. He says, “I’ll let you know if I’m angry or not;” but he
goes on dibbling, and I say no more. - -
Eighth Hour—I have been asleep again; it is getting damp., Man
still dibbling. I ask him§§ if there is any chance of catching a
chub to-day. He says, “Not while you sit there chattering.” Where;
upon I rise (which is more than the fish º and wish him a Y. i.
night. At ten o'clock I notice him in the clear moonlight still dibbling.
Up and down the stream there are dibblers. To-morrow I shall dibbl
o-morrow.—I am divided between two suggestions. A man inte-
rested in me as far asletting his boat out goes, says, "Go out a dibbling
for chub?” The landlord, disinterested, says, “ §§. I ask,
“Sniggle for chub f" He pities me, and, answers, “No, sniggle for
eels.” So, I am divided: dibbling for chubb, or snigglin for eels that
is the question. The man with a , boat settles it, like, a Solomon.
“Dibble,”, says he, “by day: ... says he, “by night.” That’s
his idea of life. It gives mean idea for a song. The fisherman's chant:-
Oh! the Fisherman is a happy wight !

some jokes on the landlord. I tried the song on theiandlord ;
it very much, and demanded it three times. N.B., I’ve since found
out that he’s a trifle deaf in one ear, and the other has got no notion
of tune. He was under the impression that I had been singing God
Sape the Queen.) -
. Third Day-In bed: having been out all yesterday dibbling, and all
night º: Caught *. except (the landlord knows this
joke and always laughs at it) a violent cold. I have no books, and no
papers. I shall compose my epitaph:—
“Here lies a Sniggler and a Dibbler.
Hooked it at last.”
A Then a few lines on a Shakespearian model might come in—
To sniggle or to dibble, that’s the question :
Whether to bait a hook with worm or bumble,
Or take up arms of any some trouble
To fish, and then home send 'em. To fly—to whip—
To moor and tie my boat up by the end
To any wooden post, or natural rock
We may be near to, on a Preservation
Devoutly to be fished. To fly—to whip-
To whip ! perchance two bream;-and there's the chub
The Doctor has just come in to say my head must be kept cool. He
allows me to write this note, and then I must take a soporific. Fare-
well, a long farewell, to all my dibbling and sniggling! Good night.
Postscriptum. I re-open my dairy (that's rather funny, because I
mean “diary”) to say that I’ve been able to go out in the garden in
a Bath chair. I asked what I could do to amuse myself for an hour in
the Bath chair. The landlord said, “Dabble for trout.” What extra-
ordinary lives these people lead! The Boots was out all last night,
sniggling. Whether he was successful or not, I do not know, as he
was discharged on his return.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GRIMALKIN FOR GAROTTERS.
No less than six roughs, two of them garotters, convicted at Man-
chester Assizes, of robbery with violence, were sentenced the other
day by MR. Justice Lush, to be, in addition to penal servitude, flogged
with the cat-o'-nine-tails. Their united terms of slavery amount to
thirty-two years, and the sum total of the number of lashes which
they were to receive is one hundred and twenty. Before passing sen-
tence on these rascals the learned Judge delivered a few admirable
observations, the point of which consisted in the announcement that
he should, at the present assizes, as he had done at the last, avail
himself of the new powers given him by the statute, of inflicting
punishment by the lash in addition to the ordinary terms of imprison-
ment and penal servitude. ... He further expressed the opinion, which
cannot be too enthusiastically cheered, that it would be the duty of
the rest of Her Majesty's Judges to pursue the course he was himself
adopting. His Lordship then proceeded to dispose of the gentlemen
in §."āoc. with a discretion whereby, accor to the subjoined
extract from *. report, which will be regarded by every truly
benevolent mind as most agreeable reading—
“Michael Carroll and Aaron Alcock (who had just been convicted of a street rob-
) were sentenced to five years' penal servitude each, and two dozen lashes each
with the cat-o'-nine-tails.
“Mark Fagan, (convicted of having, with two others not in custody, committed a
garotte robbery, leaving the victim insensible)—five years' penal servitude and
eighteen lashes.
“Michael John Flaherty, (who had pleaded guilty on two indictments, of having
committed two garotte robberies on successive days, 12th and 13th February)—
seven years' penal servitude and eighteen lashes.
" Peter Kelly and William Wright, (robbery with violence)—five years' penal servi-
tude and eighteen lashes.”
Among the judicious remarks with which MR. JUSTICE LUSH pre:
faced his dictation of these excellent, arrangements for the defence of
the community, was the proposition that—“The object of |.
was not so much to inflict pain on the criminal as to deter others
from committing offences of alike character”. Just so. Not so much.
Still the object of such punishment as that of flogging, administered
to a garotter, is very much indeed to inflict pain on the criminal. The
otter is, in *. unfortunately devoid of “the heart that can feel
or another.” He possesses, however, a skin that can feel for himself.
Therein, to restrain him from the repetition of cruelty, it is necessary to
make him feel very acutely. If there is in his nature any degree of latent
sympathy, inactive from want of º it can be stimulated to
ue activity only by a whipping which will give him considerable pain.
All that pain is economy of pain; of so, much pain as it saves respect-
able people from suffering by brutal violence.
e ruffians sentenced to the lash by JUDGE, LUSH have received
their discipline in the presence of several of the prison officials and
visiting Justices. In one or two cases the effect was excellent. But
it would have been more excellent had there been also present several
foot-pads. The flagellation, of a garotter should always be witnessed
by as many convicts as the place of punishment will hold, together with
º the roughs that can be got, by a distribution of tickets, to come and
see their fellow-man undergo the ºf punishment of the scourge,
unfortunately necessary with a view to their own instruction, and, if
possible, to render him gentle and good.
Some out of the six scoundrels whipped at Manchester, being pachy.
dermatous, made a show of brayado. To preclude this in future, let all
such offenders be sentenced to be flogged two or three times.
CELEBRITY FOR SAMUEL, BROTHERS.
THE subjoined announcement has gone the round of the papers:—
“Nºw MEDICAL CLUB-A new Club is to be established for the medical profes
sion. It is to be called “The Sydenham, in honour of the celebrated Physician of
the time of CHARLEs THE FIRst.”
The intended Medical Club had much better be called “The Harvey.”
The discoverer of the circulation of the blood is the most celebrated
physician of the time of CHARLEs THE FIRST, or of any subsequent
reign: , HARVEY is a greater name than SYDENHAM, and though it is
associated with a popular sauce as well as with a grand physiological
discovery, it is not prejudiced by a disadvantage so ludicrous as that of
association with a puff and a Pair of trºusers. As surº, as fate, if the
new Medical Club is named “The Sydenham,” it will be nicknamed
“The Seventeen-six.”

t is suppressed. M. DE LAVALETTE reports to the Emperor, and
NAPOLEON, by the Grace of God and the National Will Emperor of
the French, considers, and crushes.
Even to downtrodden France some pretence of a national reason
must be given by the Emperor of the National Will. We are told of
an article by PREVOST PARADol, insulting France by representing her
as spoliated, beaten, stupified, and degraded by recent events of war.
PRévost PARADoL is a profound thinker, a brilliant wit, and a true
Frenchman. Such men do not slander their country. The pretext is
infamously transparent. -
Here is the paragraph in the article of M. PARApol, which has
brought suppression to the Courier, and the true humiliation to France,
her Sovereign, and her Press:—
“Our birds of prey are already croaking with delight at the news of the distur-
bances in London-a riotous multitude, a few policemen beaten, gates pulled down,
a Fool trying in vain to restrain the mob he has himself excited, and reduced to
say, according to custom—“I must follow them, as I am their chief 1? What a
deſightful spectacle for those whom the too uniform spectacle of the freedom and
prosperity of England annoys as a reproach, or haunts as remorse.”
Whom does M. PARADol mean by his Fool P
It is not for us to say. -
But the Courier of the 29th July had scarcely been received in the
Refrom Clubb, in Picadilli, when a telegram flashed to the Tuileries—
One Beales, colleague of Bright, denounces the Wile Caitif of the Courter,
and demands vengeance.
Messages are carefully delivered to the Tuileries. DE LAvALETTE
the Emperor by the national will, the suppression, are but the iogical
consequences of that flash.

in these days of rams and ironclads they are both harmless and defence-
less. The Miantonomoh could sink them with a couple of shots apiece,
and then steam away unhurt by all the broadsides they could blaze at
her. What it yearly costs to paint them, and keep them at their moor-
ings, is more than we can guess; but it is clearly a waste of money to
let all this inutile lignum lie º; in our harbours, when it might, be
sold for firewood, and so return a few pounds of the thousands, it has
cost. Will somebody in Parliament }. ask why our old hulks are

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
WE have received numerous inquiries about the Vacation Judge in
Chambers. Our Legal Young Man has undertaken to give our readers
all the necessary information.
The Vacation Judge is the only Judge left in town during Vacation.
He is the “last rose of Summer left blooming alone, all his pleasant
companions are faded and gone.”
. It is, generally speaking, a punishment (the only one which can be
inflicted upon so high a legal functionary) for bad behaviour during
term time, and is, evidently, the very opposite of College Rustication.
His duties are light, but this is small compensation É. the long im-
prisonment. He spends his time, in starting imaginary objections, in
taking notes of ideal cases, in making speeches to himself before the
looking-glass, and in summing-up !
hi". tired of this, he plays leap-frog with the chairs, and dashes
Wig.
After luncheon, he amuses himself by playing on a small comb
through a piece of brown paper. Smoking is strictly prohibited in
Chambers, but his Lordship is not unºfi in keeping on the windy

REASONS WHY LADIES SHOULD NOT SHOP ON
SATURDAY AFTERNOONS.
Because it is tantalising to young men who are fond of the river to
be handling watered silks. -
Because it is hard on young men and women who would like to be
at the Crystal Palace, listening to music, to have their attention con-
fined to latestring, and their thoughts busy with band-boxes.. . .
Because it would be a pleasure to see the cheeks of the girls in the
cloak department mantle with the glow of health (fast colours). . .
Because it is better for young men, who are cricketers, to be minding
the bails of their wickets than the bales of their employers, and far more
º, to them to take part in a “tie” (both sides alike) than to
tie a scarf.
Because the shop-walkers may occasionally prefer a country lane to
a crêpe laine. -
Because it is pleasanter to be shown English meadows than to be
showing “Sicilian lawns.” -
Because if you detain young women “matching,” you may prevent
them making a good match elsewhere. -
Because it is aggravating to young men who are. Rifle Volunteers to
be answering questions about shot silks, giving replies concerning drills,
and producing “Garibaldis” for inspection. - -
Because too much of the shop may in the end bring on counterpains.
Because if it is to be all work and no play, any idea of enjoyment in
life becomes mere—illusion.

from the mention of these

is practised in their midst.
However this may be, the
advertisement, must pay, or
it would no longer be paid
for; and we therefore feel
quite justified in our ex-
tremely unpolite and barbar-
ous assumption that there
are feminine fools existing,
even in high life. Surely no
one but a fool would wish to
ruin her complexion with dis;
figuring cosmetics, and blind
her eyes most probably by
smearing them with paint.
every week, in a journal of

thing nice to look at and something clean to kiss; and he
about as soon would think of kissing his cook's dredging-
box as a face befloured and plastered with pearl-powder
and paint.

Whose blue eyes beam'd with ardent truth;
“How is it, spurning sumptuous dishes,
That great men dine on little fishes?”

They love to sport in shallow streams;

With twine, hard tugs have never fretted.

The only qualification for the Court Balls will be a

The art of
IMPROVEMENT AND EVICTION.
THE Americans talk of having improved Red Indians from off the
face of the earth. The authorities directing our civic improvements
might alsº boast that they have improved poor people out º the slums,
if, in, so doing they had not improved them out of house and home;
which is an improvement hardly to be boasted of.
On Monday last, in the Sheriff's Court, before the Common
Serjeant, more than twenty ejectment summonses were brought against
inhabitants of Lower Union, Court, Holborn Hill, who had received
notice to quit, in 9rder that their dwellings might be improved off the
face ºf that locality. Their time was up; they had not gone. What
had they to say for themselves? A young labourer said:-
'. If I am turned out. I do not know where I can go. I have a wife and three
children, and have walked many miles looking for a place Tcannot afford to give

Clarendon” and the, “Alexandra” hotels, as well as every other
public-house, open to him, on payment for accommodation. Upon
that condition, erhaps, the º e ministering at those establishments
would not even have objected to his brooms. Of course, a public-house
in the neighbourhood of Holborn would be more eligible for a scavenger.
But, having a wife and three º and earning, probably, eight or
nine shillings a week, he would have found every neighbouring public-
house practically, clºsed against him as completely as any such other
and superior public-houses as those above-named.
All that the learned Judge could say was, that “he was very sorry for
the defendant, but he must go out in ten days,” and to the remonstrance
of an elderly man, who asked where could they go if they could find
ºº:- § § ºiº ..º. . all ; hi,
ut, the law mus carried out.” He could neither he
the unfortunate defendants nor himself. p
Well, to be sure, the law of ejectment must be carried out; but
could not a law of provision for the ejected be carried in F.Could there
not be introduced among the statutes an Act obliging authorities who
preside over improvements to provide house-room for the helpless
people whose habitations they improve out of the way? The ord
whose houses are taken gets his compensation; if the tenants receive
not theirs there may be sauce for gander in this matter, but there is
negation of sauce for goose; sauce being understood to mean justice.
he Common Serjeant humanely expressed a º: that sufficient and
suitable habitations would before long be provided for the labouring
population of London; but while the bricks-and-mortar are in †. ara-
tion the houseless may perish. They would then be improved of the
face of the earth: but this would be no improvement to survivors, on
whom, by causing a scarcity of sweeps, scavengers, and other labourers
of that description, it would entail the expense of higher wages for
their labour. It will be a saving of money to save the victims of
improvement.

Nor sceptical be (like Jupitus APELLA)
Of #. my gain in the hand of a friend.
O yes, I’ll stand by him, while slatey clouds cluster,
And elements threaten their rage to expend,
And when the fierce rain-storm comes down in a Buster,
How sweet at that moment to stand by my friend
I’ll stand by my friend, if he’s dressed out in Swelldom,
And I look as seedy as any old Jew,
In greasified paletot, hat brushed very seldom,
And waistcoat that hardly was decent when new.
I’ll stand by my friend, folks will see us ºther,
And half of his lustre on me shall descend;
Is Friendship a Name? If it’s not, in bad weather,
Or queer ſooking toilette, I’ll stand by my friend.
An Incomparable Paving Material.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HARDY HOOD-WINKED.
THE RIGHT Honour ABLE GATHORNE HARDY, from his place in the
House of Commons, lately told us, in allusion to the treatment of sick
paupers in the London Union-houses, that “Local Self-Government.”
was on its trial. And so JoHN BULL feels it ought to be; and asks
nothing better than to see BUMBLE hauled up at the bar of public
opinion whenever a primá facie case is made out against him for inhu-
manity to our sick, and suffering, paupers though they be, But MR.
HARDy's notions about the mode of trial, the judges, and the verdicts,
in these cases, seem to differ from JoHN Burt's as much as from those
of his predecessor in office.
We have lately seen BUMBLE arraigned on some rather remarkable
cases of alleged cruelties and neglects of the sick in the ...'.
Rotherhithe, and Strand Unions, in which MR. FARNALL conducted the
case for his clients—who sued in formſ tºº the President of
the Poor Law Board (then the RIGHT Hon. C. P. WILLIERs) sat as
judge, and (as the inquiry was public, and very fully reported) the British
public was empanelled as jury. The Judge has not yet, we believe,
pronounced sentence, but we violate no secret when we say that the
§ have made up their minds as to the verdict, and that it is against
UMBLE on all the counts—“Guilty of the grossest inhumanity, stu-
pidity, and neglect of duty”—accompanied, certainly, by no recom-
mendation to mercy; but if § anything, by a suggestion of as much
extra whi #. law allows. But now it seems from what we
hear that MR. y’s notions of bringing BUMBLE to trial on some
even graver charges still hanging over his head, are altogether different
from those of his predecessor. BUMBLE, if he must be brought to
trial, is to appear before a jury of BUMBLEs, with one of the BUMBLE
family to prosecute, and another to pronounce sentence—MR HARDy
sitting merely as official assessor, to ratify the BUMBLE verdict and
sentence, We need hardly add that the result hitherto has been, and
º in all future cases be expected to be, a triumphant “Not Guilty.”
and a general whitewashing, by all the Husſairs concerned, of their
respected relative and very humble_servant in the dock. When we
state that the scene of the alleged offences in the first case thus tried
was Shoreditch Workhouse, and that among the charges on which the
*.was put to his purgation, were the following agreeable little
-- coun ”—
“That a patient was tied in a chair for hours barely clad, and that he was re-
º beaten; that foul substances were forced into his mouth as a punishment for
dirtiness, and, being ejected, were again forced upon him; that another 3.
- was tied, beaten, and kicked and laid upon the stones and denied water to k,”
it will be admitted that the case is no joke, except to the BUMBLEs,
who can get fun out of even such grave materials as mesenteric disease
and starvation-so they be among paupers. -
But if MR. HARDy's notion of putting Local Self-Government on its
trial, comes to this—to refer to the Guardians allinquiries into the gros-
sest alleged misconduct of their own paid officers—misconduct which, by
implication, involves, the Guardians themselves—we can hardly doubt
that all the trials will result, as this Shoreditch one has resulted, in a
triumphant acquittal of the accused on all the main counts in the
indictment. In the name of John BULL, Mr. Punch is instructed to
move for a new trial in the Shoreditch case—for a trial in which no
BUMBLE shall be allowed to take part, except as witness or accused,
instead of being invited, as MR. HARDY seems disposed to invite them,
to occupy both the seat of counsel for the defence, the jurymen's box,
and the Judge's chair, to the exclusion of more competent, unbiassed,
and disinterested agents of authority and ministers of justice... If the
farce of the Shoreditch inquiry be repeated by the new President of
the Poor-Law Board, it will be a case not only of hardi-hood, but of
“HARDy hood-winked; ” and we need hardly add, that for ahead of
the Poor-Law Board to wink at such infamies and abuses, is only the
§: step towards having that head removed to make way for a
er.
CASES FOR THE CAT.
THE worst of our legislative system is, that if a law is found to want
mending in August, we are obliged to wait before we can get it mended
till February. For instance, now, there is the statute relative to robbery
with violence. A case occurred the other day at the Middlesex Ses-
sions, showing that Act, excellent as far as it reaches, not to reach far
enough; but there will be no ºf the requisite enlargement of it
for the next six or seven months. Three fellows, described in the
Assize report as “determined looking ruffians,” and as “a sample of
the roughs who frequent Lisson Grove,” were indicted for a murder-
ous assault upon CHARLEs AMEs, a butcher in that neighbourhood.
They had stolen some meat from AMEs's shop and made off with it;
and on his §º. and taxing them with the theft, they all three
set upon him in the manner thus detailed by the prosecutor, whose
statement was confirmed by other evidence:—
“Blake struck him twice :*:::::::::::::::: §: is a
tely behind the ear.
erful fellow)
struck him several violent blows imm threw
ey
down, and CAIN jumped upon him. The prosecutor struggled to his feet again, when
CAIN put his leg round that of the prosecutor, throwing him violently to the
ground and tº: his leg in two places. The other prisoners were all this time
striking and kicking him in the ribs, and other parts of his body.”
Having been convicted of this outrage, MEssRs. SHEEN, BLARE, AND
CAIN, were sentenced by DEPUTY-Assistant-JUDGE PAYNE to such
punishment as the law enabled him to award them. , MR. SHEEN was
consigned to five, MR. BLAKE, to seven years' penal servitude. MR.
Čarº got off with two years' imprisonment and hard labour. The
reason why they were not, in addition, condemned to be severely
whipped, doubtless was because they were indicted merely for assault,
not for robbery, accompanied with violence, and whipping cheer
. to have been ; provided for assault, in connection with
robbery. It is very desirable that judges shºuld have the power to
prescribe the cat-o'-nine-tails in cases of ferocious outrage. For
ruffians who have broken a man's leg in two places no punishment can
be considered complete unless, for part of it, they have their backs
scored in several Corporal punishment for brutal violence is payment
in kind. The administration of knotted whipcord would ; be
also found, preventive of wife-squelching, or jumping and stampin
performed by a savage on his wife with the advantage of hob-naile
ankle-jacks. Moreover, it is likely that, if by a murderous assault
every ruffian incurred the visitation of the lash, considerably fewer
murders would be committed. To this result nobody could possibl
object but MR. CALCRAFT, whose income it would reduce. If, indeed,
that gentleman were younger, the loss might be made up to him by
employment in the application of the scourge which would supersede
the noose, But, unfortunately, MR. CALCRAFT is somewhat advanced

MR. WALPOLE'S “TEARS, IDLE TEARS.”
We have been requested from 59 many quarters to give thºrest gº
the beautiful version of “Tears, Idle Tears,” by the RIGHT Hon. S.
W., of which we printed the first stanza only in our penultimate
number, that we have obtained the right honourable gentleman's
consent to the reprinting of that stanza, and the printing of the others
for the first time.
Tears, idle tears—a sweet sensation scene-.
Tears at the thought of that Hyde Park affair
Rise in the eye, and trickle down the nose,
In looking on the haughty EDMOND BEALEs,
And thinking of the shrubs that are no more.
Fresh, as the first greens glittering for sale,
Brought by the vans up from their*den world,
Sere, as the last that linger on a st
Whose stock has not been cleared at lower'd charge,
So fresh, so sere, the shrubs that are no more 1
Ah sad and strange, as in dark summer dawns,
The stern “move on ” of half-awakened blues
To º ears, when upon park-tramps' eyes
Is slowly turned the bullseye's glittering glare,
So sad, so strange, the cads that rob no more!
Dear as remembered hisses to the roughs,
And sweet as those by baffled BEALEs arranged
For me from angry Leaguers, dear and sweet,
With lessons ſº though source of deep regret,
MAYNE force, Hyde Park, and rails that are no more 1

HAPPY THOUGHTS.
Happy Thought.—To take that Old Feudal Castle which is to be let
for one month, to see how I like it. I have written about it, and the
answer is “two months, with the shooting.” I may certainly note it
down as a happy thought, that I have agreed to the terms, including

umbrella, a fishing-rod, a stick, a great coat, and a writing-case.]" "
Having done so, I am overtaken, on my road, by the boots with a
Telegram, (I findi had forgotten to tip the Boots), to say that the
resent family are going to stop in the Feudal Castle for a fortnight
onger; so I must defer my tenancy, I don't think I can return and
dibble. A º §: just at this time occurred to a friend, whom
I met at the Popham Road Station. He said, “Come down with me
to els,” the name of his little place in the county, “ and we’ll
have some fun.” I said, “With pleasure, what fun?” He replied,
“Oh, lots of things: drag the pond.” I saw that he was enthusiastic
upon the subject, so I rubbed my hands, º: them together, and
cried, “Capital—the verything; nothing I should enjoy more:by all
means, drag the pond.” We will be off by this train. "My friend, who

out of spirit-land a violin is always held by one

answers carelessly, looking out of the window, “Oh, much the same as

which Old Merºval, regards with curiosity my friend from Boodels,
who is fast asleep, with #. leg over the arm of the seat, looking like

My friend says, “Haven’t you_heard?” I reply. “No,” pleasantly,
expecting to find ToMMY made a Lieutenant-General. It turns out that
the mention of ToMMY is unpleasant: he has not been heard of since
he went out to hunt alligators in a bush. I wish I’d not been so con-
foundedly inquisitive. A damp has fallen on our spirits. -
Old MERRIVAL presently attempts a change in the conversation by

inform him that “I don't think that’s Boodels.” . He says, “Oh, I’m

to burglar , that “we’re going to have some fun there.” He says, as
I did, “What fun?” ... I reply, as if that was something like a joke,
“Drag the pond.” He doesn't seem to take much account of this,
and rather snubs my notion of pleasure by remarking, ºğ.
“Slightly slow York, isn't it?” I reply, sticking up for it, “Oh,

I return, “so am I him.” He adds, as a happy thought, just
as the train is moving, “If you’re coming by this way at any time

wonder how he’d like me to look him up at 1 A.M. He nods

leave each other for another ten years. This idea tending to melan-

Hereupon, my friend of Boodels wakes up, and says, “Hallo! where
are we, eh?” being under the impression that we’ve passed the
station. He informs me that he has been asleep. He wants now to
know the eract time. I rouse myself with much trouble, and tell him,

sudden spring out of the carriage-window on the first opportunity,
when friend from Boodels, who has suddenly found his watch-key,
wants to know “the eract time.” I pretend to guess it. He says
“No ! do look, as 1 want to set my watch.” I lay down, for the thir
time, my rod, umbrella, stick, writing-case, rug, and great-coat, and
unbutton my frock-coat, also for the third time, take out my watch,
and tell him “3:30," with perhaps a little irritability of manner. He
doesn't say “Thank you!” but sets to work winding up his watch.
By the time I have my umbrella, great-coat, rod, writing-case, rug, and
stick, in my hands, and on my arms, for the fourth time (it seems the
fiftieth), he inquires, “Did I say 3:30 or 3.36°.” I reply, “3:30; but

it’s where they take the tickets.

writing-case, fishing-rod and rug for the fifth time, unbuttoning my

it, with my latch-key, which appear, both together, to have made a
hole for themselves in my waistcoat pocket, and gone on a burrowing
excursion into the lining. Thank goodness, I get rid of the ticket at

clippers, and goes on. It appears that we are half-an-hour from

because of the nuisance of unbuttoning, &c. The question is, for such
a short time, is it worth while to undo one's rug, exchange hat, for

Happy Thought.—To have separate pockets made for everything.
Happy Thought.—That here we are at Boodles. Friend's groom not
here. Friend wants to know the eract time. I refer him (being
buttoned up, myself) to his own watch. He says, “It’s stopped
again, he can't make it out.” I have just put down my fishing-rod,
umbrella, writing-case and rug. on the platform, and am unbuttoning
my coat, when friend says, “Oh, don't bother, here's the Station-master
will tell us,” who does so, and fbutton up my coat for the eighth time.

affably, who is sitting with his arms folded regarding the country

shortly, “Yes, Sir,” as if he thought I was taking a liberty in ad-
dressing him.
Happy Thought.—Always ingratiate yourself with servants: talk to
grooms about horses, if you can. Here we are at Boodels. It turns
out on arriving at the House, that the time at Boodels is different from
either London time or railway time, and, therefore, just as I am going
up-stairs to my room, § friend asks me for the eract time. I place º
rug, umbrella, coat, fishing-rod, stick, and writing-case on the h
table for the tenth, and last time, and tell him 430. Whereupon he
goes off and sets the big clock in the hall, the musical clock on the
stairs, the little clock in the dining-room, the time-pieces in the bed:
rooms, while the butler disappears, and is heard telling the cook all
about it, when a whirring noise comes from the pantry and the kitchen.

walks down to the sun-dial; the Footman returns loo at his own
watch. I follow him ..". to my room. Before he is out of the
room. I find myself asking him the time, and referring to my own
watch. He should say (diffidently) that it’s “about twenty minutes
to five.” I correct him, and give him the eract time. He withdraws
thankfully, and I remain standing opposite the window, mºditatively,
with my watch in my hand, ready to give anyone the exact time.***
Knock at the door; “Dinner is at half-past six to-day.” Very well,
thank you." Could I give Master the exact time, as his watch 'ave

CALUMNY ON THE CORPORATION.
At a Special Court of Aldermen the other day a com-
laint was made } MR. ALDERMAN GUTTLE, of disrespect-
§ language applied in the Pall Mall Gazette, to the
Corporation and the Lord MAYor. The worthy Alderman
said with the permission of the Court he would read out
the passage which he considered objectionable. It was as
follows:–“It is by no means a satisfactory thing that the
eating of luxurious feasts should be habitually looked up
to as the summum bonum of human life by that numerous
body, whose apex is the Lord Mayor of London.” He
defied the writer of that passage to bring forward the
shadow of º: that any sum had been boned by the
respectable body on which he (the writer) cast the impu-
tation of looking to a summum bonum in connection with
eating and ºf: and he (ALDERMAN GUTTLE) should
like to know what he (the writer in the Pall Mall Gazette)
meant by calling the LoRD MAYoR an apex. The LQRD
MAyor of LoNDoN was no more an apex than the writer
who termed him one, and if London's Chief Magistrate
was an apex, he would not hesitate to say the Editor of
the Pall Mall, Gazette was another. The observations of
the worthy Alderman were ordered to be recorded in the
minutes.

That on the name of Protestant thou bringest scorn and laughter.

Whereby thou mayst discredit thy so well assumed persuasion
By calumnies prodigious of our creed and practice, founded,

DANCING DINNERS.
THE Paris correspondent of the Post says that, at Anjou, about the
period of the Craon races, “a ball and several diners dansants are spoken
of, to be given by the Countess AIBERT DE LA RochEFoucAULD in
her beautiful château in la Poterie.”...We had often before heard of
a “the dansant,” but a “ diner dansant” is something new. Of course
the legs of mutton do not dance at a diner dansant any more than the
muffins do at a thé. A diner dansant seems a very questionable species
of hop. Who but a young lady, or a very young man, would ever
dance directly after dinner, having really #3? º, least, no prudent
persºn would venture on a waltz, recollecting what Stephano says:
‘Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.” e
wonder whether the guests of the Countess DE LA RochEroucAU1.D
in la Poterie danced, at or after their dancing dinner, amongst the
dishes of their fair hostess, as Scotchmen dance between swords, and
some people between eggs, which would do for a déjeiner dansant.
There is a light in which a ce round a vessel con food
appropriate for a certain class of consumers, may be regarded as having
been somewhat of a diner dansant.

“General Utility Office” at Whitehall, in-

EXPRESSION.
untold agonies from the REPOSE and snore of an elderly stout
gentleman with a pretty niece, he revenges himself upon the sleeper
by conversing with the young lady, to whom he shows marked
Polite NEss when attempting to hand her from the carriage on
their arrival at Southampton; but the WRATH of the disagreeable
Uncle produces an abject sense of FEAR in PHIPson, which is but
imperfectly allayed by the appearance of JACK Pugsby, whose tarry
hand he feels obliged to shake in a spirit of true FRIENDship. The
ready HELP afforded him by the first mate in handing him on to the
h/hipster is however very distressing to him, and the CAUTION which
he shows when vainly trying to hold his straw hat on his head in a
stiff gale, foretells his ALARM on their shipping a sea, but the DESPAIR
into which he sinks when, while making himself useful in preparing
the midday meal, he misses his footing and pitches knives, forks, glass
and crockery overboard at “one fell swoop” is something not to be

So that as his THIRST can only be quenched out of a two gallon
stone bottle, and HUNGER is but barely appeased by gnawing a mutton

several very narrow escapes. However, I nearly, succeeded in getting your Austrian
Military Correspondent hanged as a spy. I don't know why they didn't do it;
they promised me the would. There’s no trusting those Austrians. Praps
they've shot him. I haven't heard any report, to that effect. If they have, that
will be one off your staff, and you can give me the extra salary.
The EMPERoit of THE FRENCH wrote to BISMARck the other day,+but perhaps
I am hardly, justified in breaking a confidence. The Prussians, have a new
weapon called the needle-gun, it has proved yery serviceable during the recent war.
I have (being, you will be ashamed to hear, in want of funds) invented a new rifle,
myself, which has given, as far as the drawing goes, a great deal of satisfaction to
the Prussian Generals. It is so constructed as to be †. of being fired while
running away; and in time of peace, or in bivouac, it will serve as, an admirable
amusement for the soldiers, as there is a musical box in the stock which plays two

They now treat me very well: they didn't. Out of politeness they offered me

A SAD disappointment was inconsiderately inflicted on a numerous portion of
the British Public the other day at Manchester. A man had been sentenced to
be hanged. His execution was appointed to take place at the New Bailey Prison
on the 18th of August. For some reason or other, it was postponed. Let the Times
relate what cnsued;—
“The postponement of the execution was unknown to great numbers of º up to Friday,
and on that evening many persons from a distance took their stand under the prison walls with
a view, by remaining there all night, of securing a favourable position from which to witness
the spectacle, and many lingered about some hours, unwilling to believe when told that the
execution had been postponed, although they could sce no drop or
other signs of preparation on the part of the prison authorities.”
What a shame! How cruel to create hopes only to
mock them! The prison authorities of Manchester ought
to have advertised the *...". of the tragedy which
they had announced. placard, notifying the alteration
resolved on, should have been posted outside the prison. f;
the delay had arisen from "Cºcº's indisposition a
medical certificate to that effect ought to have been pub-
lished. No doubt when the Manager of the New Bailey
next appears on the stage of that institution, he will be
hissed. It was too bad of him to allow an anxious crowd
9f spectators to remain half the night, casting their long-
ing and lingering looks on the prison walls, without so
much as a drop to comfort them.

GBoyk, Q.C., high installed in the chair
Of the wise men assembled at Nottingham,
Surveys Earth and Heaven, Sea and Air,
By Science's metes and bounds plotting 'em.
Pokes his fingers well under Earth’s crust,
Explores our dirt-pie's darkest corner,
Pulls Geolºgy's plums from their dust.
Philosophy’s “little JAck HoRNER l’”
Treads, serene, aether's luminous field,
With an eye above fancies or fallacies;
Tests the metals in Phºebus' own shield, -
And puts star-light through spectrum-analysis.
Identifies heat, electricity
Reviews the Magnetical Forces;
Shows the Universe in its simplicity—
Cell, plus power of so many horses.
Till we ask, with a GRovE in the van,
What the dickens is science afraid of,
Thanks to spectra and forces, now man
Has quite settled what the world’s made off
We know matter and force and no more;
For that ghost—a first cause—we have laid it;
But the bore is, the world is still there,
And weak people will still ask, “who made it?”
Not content with cell-matter and force,

Will insist on some great “primum mobile.

Tries his hand at creating an elephant.
From a cell he su º it grew
Under pressure, by process Darwinian.
That there is a sell here may be true—
Is’t in elephant, or in opinion ?
We can readily fancy the shock
Of a ready-made elephant bringing
His trunk from the heart of a rock,
Or his tusks from a hollow-tree wringing;
But would it less shock (what we’re urgin

To witness the monster emerging

No GRove, Q.C., man's heart can ossify :

Folks will scarce leave old lights for the new

Nor believe with poor Topsy, they Grew,

pieces, the dimensions not to exceed a specified length, and, when new, the cloth
must be disfigured with mud, or otherwise, before he puts it on.”

ARTEMUS WARD
MR. Punch, My DEAR SIR,
You prob'ly didn't meet my uncle WILYIM when he was on
these shores. I jedge, so from the fack, that his pursoots wasn't
litrary. Commerce, which it has been trooly observed by a statesman,
or somebody, is the foundation stone onto which a nation's greatness
ñº". Commerce, was UNCLE WILYIM's fort. He sold soap.
It smelt pretty, and redily commanded two pents a cake. I’m the
only litrary man in our fam’ly. It is troo, I once had a deat guzzun
who wrote 22 versis onto “A Child who nearly Died of the Measles,
O' " but as he injoodiciously introjuced a chorious at the end of each
stanzy, the parrents didn't like it at all. The father in particler
wept afresh, assaulted my cuzzun, and said he never felt so ridicklus
in his intire life. The onbappy result was that my cuzzun abandind
poetry forever, and went back to shoemakin, a shattered man -
My Uncle Wºm disposed of his soap and returned to his nativ
land with a very ...] opinyin of the British public. “It is a
edycated, community,” said he: “they’re a intellectooal pºple. In
one small village alone. I sold 50 cakes of soap, incloodin barronial
halls, where they offered me a ducal coronet, but I said no-give it to
the poor.” This was the way UNCLE WILYix went on. He told us,
however, some stories that was rather too much to be easily swallerd,
In fack, my UNCLE WILYIM was not a emblem of trooth. e retired
some years ago on, a hansum comptency derived from the insurance-
money he received on a rather shaky Skooner he owned, and which
turned up while lyin at a wharf one night, the cargo havin fortnity
been remooyed the day afore the disastriss calamty occurd. UNCLE
WILYIM said it was one of the most singler things he ever heard of;
and, after collectin the insurance-money, he bust into a flood of tears,
and retired to his farm in Pennsylvany. He was my uncle by marrige
only. I do not say that he wasn’t a intº man. I simply say that if
you have a uncle, and bitter experunce tells you it is more profitable
in a pecoomery pint of view to put pewter spoons instid of silver ones
onto the table when that, uncle dines with you, in a frenly way-
I simply say, there is sumthun wrong in our social sistim, which calls
loudly for reform.
I rived on these shores at Liverpool, and proceeded at once to
London. I stopt at the Washington Hotel in Liverpool, because it
was named in honour of a countryman of mine who didn't get his ºf
by makin' mistakes, and whose memºry is dear to civilised peple
over the world, because he was gentle and good as well as trooly ſº

to be a candidate for a prom'nent offiss, and hence doesn't wish to

dubble the price of admission”); I say I am a exhibiter of startlin

'em. If you say, “Ah, yes, but also your hours of grief and misfortin;”

that he was the most feroshus Cannibal of his tribe, and that, alone and
unassisted, he had et sev’ril of our fellow-countrymen, and that he had
at one time even contemplated eatin his UncLEThomas on his mother's
side, as well as other near and dear relatives, when I was makin'
these simple statements, the mis’ble young man said I was a lyer, and
knockt me off the platform. Not quite satisfied with this, he cum and
trod hevily on me, and as he was a very musculer person and wore
remarkable thick boots, I knew at once that a canary bird wasn’t
walkin' over me.
I admit that my ambition ovelept herself in this instuns, and I’ve
been very careful ever since to deal square with the public. If I was
the public I should insist on squareness, tho'I shouldn’t do as a portion
of my audience did, on the occasion jest mentioned, which they was
emplyed in sum naberin’ coal mines. “As you hain't got no more
Cannybals to show us, old man,” said one of 'em, who seemed to be a
kind of leader among 'em—a tall º skoundril—" as you seem
to be out of Cannybals, we’ll sorter look round here and fix things.
Them wax figgers of yours want washin'. There's Napoleon Bony-
parte and Julius Cæsar—they must have a bath,” with which coarse
and brutal remark he imitated the shrill war hoop of the western
savige, and, assisted by his infamus coal-heavin companyins, he threw
all my wax-work into the river, and let my wild bears loose to pray on
a peaceful and inoffensive agricultooral community.

cum to London in a 1st class car, passin' the time very agreeable in

Holstein question. We took that int’resting question up and carefully
traced it from the time it commenced being so, down to the present
day, when my countryman, at the close of a four hours' annymated

be lots of fun besides. I find he means dragging the pond. I say, out
of ºpiº to him, that I am looking forward to this; and he seems
pleased. He, lights a cigar, and we then enjoy literary conversation-
that is, I read to him my manuscript materials for my work. Just as
I am commencing, he asks me for the eract time, as at nine o'clock
he has a friend coming in. I tell him it’s past that now, whereupon
he says, “ Fº he won't come: it's only MILBURD, who lives in
the next place; he won't disturb us,” and finishes by asking me to
“go on, old fellow!” I go on, accordingly.
Happy Thought.—It’s a rare i. find any one possessed of the
faculty of appreciation. BoopeLs has it. Böopels is a very good
fellow. I don't know any one for whom I would do more than I would
for, B9QDELs. There are very few to whom I’d read my manuscript
materials for Tºpical Developments—very few; but I don't mind reading
them, to BooDELs. It isn’t every one to whom I’d say, "Now, m

says, “Oh, I only asked.”. I thank him for asking, and tell him that

I liked that.” I say, “Yes, I do.” The lamp wants trimming, an

Osborne :—
“HER MAJESTY still adheres to mourning attire.”
Is this Court English for “the QUEEN still wears mourning " Or
are we to understand by “The QUEEN adhering to her attire,” that her

MISS LAVINIA BROUNJONES.—No. 3.
HAVING SECURED A MoDEL For “THE FLocks” IN HER PICTURE OF “CATTLE LIFTING"—
LETTER FROM A LADY.
DEAR SIR,
I do not trouble myself much about politics, of course. They
seem to be a tolerably harmless, if not very quiet amusement for grown:
up boys. If they meant anything serious, I suppose that they would
be taken up seriously by H. Government. In the meantime, if it
entertains my husband and other women's husbands to chatter and
clatter over them, while they finish their claret, I do not know that
there is any º Men must be amused.
But mischief is, often done by meddling with what people do not
understand; and though I am not at all fond of seeing myself in print
(except in the lists of our parochial charities), I must ask you to let
me say that MR. MILL and his friends have been at this work. -
Having to stay in town when every decent person is out of it (I will
not intrude reasons which might cause just shame on a certain face), I
thought that I would order in coals, which I naturally supposed would
be cheaper at this time of year. To my astonishment an disgust, I
found that the price was higher than in last spring.
“What does that mean?” said I to the agent, who is a very civil
Inan.
“Well, M'm,” he said, “the fact is, that gentlemen in Parliament
chose to raise an alarm that the coals of the country were being
exhausted, and the coalowners took the hint, and raised the prices,
and, what’s more, I don't believe we shall see them down again.”
Now, Mr. Punch, I call this beyond a joke. It is always so when
men meddle. As sure as fate, when I hear that any tax has been taken
off in the Budget, I know that the article will be charged more in my
little, red books, and so it always is. That is, natural. But that
Members of Parliament should go and raise an alarm, and make war,
as I may §§ upon the family coalskuttle, is rather too bad, and I hope
that MR. MILL and all the scientific men who have been talking non-
sense, as if coals would't last our time, will find their skuttles full of
slates all through the winter. I wish you would make a picture of this,
and oblige Your obedient Servant,
MATERFAMILIAs.

AN INSECTIVOROUS TRIBE.
SERVANTs, in London and its suburbs, have often much to complain
of the black beetles which infest kitchens, and, let masters and mis-
tresses bear in mind, larders also. To get rid of these coleopterous
nuisances, many housekeepers are wont to engage a hedgehog, in
addition to their domestics. Now, sometimes these object to the com-
pany of their prickly companion. The subjoined extract from a leading
article in the Daily Telegraph indicates a possibility of exterminating
black beetles, cockroaches, and any other such intruders into our
abodes by the simple aid of servants Wło are themselves insectivorous:–
“MR. Poston, the agent of the United States Minister of the Interior, tells us
that, having been requested by the Smithsonian Institute at Washington to collect
for scientific purposes all the bats, snakes, insects, rats, rabbits, birds, beetles,
fish, grasshoppers, and horned frogs in Arizona, he found, on arriving there, that

the other things above enumerated, by the failure of the customary
fertilising inundation of the Colorado River, but there can be no doubt
that they ate their snakes with all the appetite that a serpent can be
devoured with by a mungoose. If some of these Arizona Indians could
be imported into this country, and put into livery (which would become
them), they might be employed down-stairs in the twofold capacity of
footman and hedgehog. And when they had eaten up all the beetles,
and rats and mice, then they might be turned into the garden to destrºy
the slugs and snails, and worms, and w bs, and the like. Only
they would have to be told to let the toads and frogs alone, because
these creatures are not .# harmless but useful; for the kill flies,

for the purpose of

We are happy in being able to announce that the directors of the School of
Design intend to offer prizes for the best pictures suitable to adorn the walls of
workhouses, with a view to elevate the conceptions of their inmates above, the
realities of Union life. For that purpose engravings from the pictures will be
made for the parishes whose guardians may be disposed to purchase them, since
the ratepayers can hardly be expected to stand frescoes. Two distinguished
artists are already at work on paintings for the decoration of our chief parochial
institutions. The subject of one is fi. assistance rendered to the man who fell
among thieves, and a guardian of the Shoreditch Union is sitting for the Good
Samaritan. That of the other is Alfred Diriding his Loaf with the Beggar; the
model for ALFRED being a Beadle in his official costume.
A FACT AND A FICTION AT BOULOGNE.
THE other day at Boulogne-sur-Mer the Cathedral of Nôtre Dame of that ilk was
consecrated with great solemnity. This church has been erected in celebration
of the arrival, in the port of Boulogne, A.D. 636, of a boat without pilot or sail,
and of course without steam, enveloped in a mysterious light, and containing for
its sole crew a wooden image of the \º and Child. During the great French
Revolution, this miraculous image is said to have been destroyed by the sans
culottes. This, however, is incredible. There can, of course, be no doubt about the
arrival of the image, by superhuman impulse, in Boulogne Harbour in 636. But it
cannot have been destroyed in 1793. A miraculous image, is quite capable of
holding its own, and this one, if it had submitted to be smashed to pieces, would
have put itself together again. It will turn up.

ARTEMUS WARD IN LONDON.
You’ll be glad to learn that I’ve made a good impression onto the
mind of the lan'lord of the Greenlion tavern. He made a speech about
me last night: Risin’ in the bar he spoke as follers, there bein over
20 individooals present: “This North American has been a inmate of

This last remark is a sirkastic and wither’in thrust at them blotid
peple who live in gildid saloons. I tho't I’d explain my meanin’ to
you. I frekently have to explain the meanin' of my remarks. I know
one man—and he’s a man .# varid 'complishments—who often reads
my articles over 20 times afore he can make anything of 'em at all.
Our skoolmaster to home says this is a pecoolerarity of geneyus. My
wife says it is a pecoolerarity of infernal nonsens. She’s a exceedin
practycal woman. I luv her muchly, however, and humer her little
ways. It’s a recklis falshood that she henpecks me, and the youn
man in our naberhood who said to me one evenin', as I was mistenin
my diafram with a gentle cocktail at the villige tayun-who said to
me in these very langwidge. “Go home, old man, onless you desires to
have another teapot throwd at you by B. J.,” probly regrets havin
said so. I said, “Betsy Jane is my wife's front name, gentle yooth,
and I permits no person to alood to her as B. J. outside of the family
circle, of which I am it F. I myself. Your other observations
I scorn and disgust, and I must ji. ou off.” He was a able-bodied
young man, and, remoovin his coat, he inquired if I wanted to be
ground to powder? I said, Yes: if there was a Powder-grindist handy
nothin would 'ford me greater pleasure, when he struck me a painf
blow into my right eye, causin' me to make a rapid retreat into the
fire-place. I hadn't no idee, that the enemy was so well organised.
But I rallied and went for him, in a rayther vigris stile for my time
of life. Hisparunts lived nearby, and I will simply state 15 minits had
only elapst after the first act, when he was carrid home on a shutter.
His mama met the sollum procession at the door, and after keerfully
looking her orfspring over, she said, “My son, I see how it is distinc-

“I THINK, HERE BE TRUTHS.”
| ENGLAND’s Mission is to tell the truth to all sorts of people. Her
sons are seldom deficient in the will and the courage necessary to this
end. We think that a stronger evidence of the fact has seldom been
given than on a recent occasion by the Italian Special Correspondent
of the Daily Telegraph. ...All his senses outraged by the atrocious un-
cleanliness of an inn at Bergamo, MR. SALA expressed his opinions to
the landlord. This fellow—
“Was insolent enough to tell me that the incredibly horrible nature of his
domestic arrangements was thought good enough for Italians, and pari passu.
ought to suit English people. But I told him that his inn could not have been
intended for Italians, whom I respected as a noble and intelligent people, seeing
that his house was fit only for skunks and swine, of whom I added, by way of a
compliment, he was one. Whereat he looked as though he would have stabbed me,
but ultimately subsided into a kitchen."
As PETER PINDAR said, when his satires on KING GEORGE THE
Third were thought rather too emphatic, “It is of no use whipping
pigs with velvet.” There be also hostelries nearer, home, in which,
non obstante the cant about the perfection of British inns, and in
defiance of the hack quotation, from SHENSTONE, some, such mild
remonstrance might not be undeserved. But it is desirable that the
administrator should be prepared with the British fist to back up the
British criticism. We speak as those who have been bitten, over-
charged, cheated, and insulted, and who have read the above extract
with a vengeful pleasure.

HAPPY THOUGHTS.
At Boodels. The morning after the literary conversation already
recorded. Second day at Boodels. 6:30 A.M. eract time.—It’s won-
derful to me how BooDELS (of Boodels) manages to get up at half-past
six in the morning, after going to bed at 3:20. He does do it, with a
horn too, which he comes to my bedside and blows (his idea of hearty
fun!), and with dogs, which he brings into one's, room. I didn't see
the animals last night; now I do. I don't like them—at least in my
bedroom. There’s one Skye, a black-and-tan, a pug, and an unde-
cided terrier. He explains that two of 'em always sleep in his room,
and he then makes them º on my bed.
Happy Thought.—Always lock your bedroom door, on account of
sleep-walkers. I recollect a story of a monk stabbing a mattress,
and somebody going mad afterwards, which shows how necessary it is
to lock the door of your cell. At all events, it keeps out any one with
a horn, and dogs. -

morning, old boy,” and pulls up my blinds. I like to find out it’s a
lovely ºf for myself, and pull up º own blinds, or else I get a
headache. The undecided terrier and the Fº are growling at what
they can see of me above the counterpane. I try (playfully, of course,
because BooDELs is my host) to kick them off, but §. only snap at
my toes. BooDELs says, “They think they’re rats. Å. º ’re as
sensible as Christians, when they know you.” They don't know me,
however, and go on taking my toes for rats.
635 to 645–BooDELs, says, “We’ll have a little air, eh?” and
opens both, windows. He says, “There, that’s better.” I reply,
“Yes, that’s better,” and turn on, my side, trying, to imagine, by
shutting my eyes, that BooDELs, with dogs, is not in the room.

to open my eyes again. I ask him, feebly, where, he gºt it?”

to repeat, “Where did you get it?” He then begins a story about a

wards found, the door open. - -

black muzzle, and showing his teeth: what a fancier, I believe, would

would shut the door when he goes out. I look at the dog. The dog
doesn't stir, but twitches his nostrils up and down. I never saw a dog
do that before. I say to myself, in order to inspirit myself, “He can't
make me out.” I really don't like to get up while he's there. -

His eye is mistrustful; bull-dogs never growl when they’re going to
fly at you : he doesn’t growl.
Happy Thought.—If you hit a bulldog over the front legs, he's done:
If not, I suppose you’re done. [This for my chapter, in Typical
Developments, on “Nature's Defences.”] If you wound a lion in his
fore paw, he’ll come up to you... On second thought, p'raps, he'd
come up to you if you didn't. Bulldogs always spring at your throat.
If in bed, you can avoid that by getting under the clothes. -
Happy Thought—One ought always to have a bell by the bed in case
of robbers, and a pistol.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
7'45. The dog has been here for a quarter of an hour and I can’t get
up. WILLKs, the butler, appears with my clothes and hot water. The
dog welcomes him—so do I, gratefully. He says, “Got Grip up here
with you, Sir? He don’t offen make friends with strangers.” Isay, with-
out explanation, “Fine dog that,” as if I’d had him brought to my
room to be admired. WILLRs, the butler, informs me that “Master
wouldn't take forty pounds for that dog, Sir;” and I say, with sur-
rise, “Wouldn't he " Butler repeats, “No, Sir, not forty pounds—
e’s been offered thirty.” Whereupon, finding, I’ve been on a wrong
tack (N.B. Never be on a wrong tack with, the butler), I observe,
knowingly, as if I was making a bargain, “Ah, I should have thought
about thirty—not more, though.” utler says, “Yes, Sir, Master
could get that,” and I answer positively, “Oh, yes, of course,” which
impresses the butler with the motion that I’d give it myself any day of
the week. Think the butler likes me better after this.
I calculate upon getting ten minutes more in bed. “What’s the exact
time?” The butler has a watch, and is ready. “810.” “Eract.” “Exact.”
“Then" (by way of a further delay) “bring my clothes, please.” They
are here. “Oh, well,” (last attempt,) “my boots.” #éen here some
time. Then I must get up, that’s all. That is all, and I get up.
Breakfast. MILBURD has sent in to know if we drag the pond to-day,
BooDELs consults WILLKs “What does he say, eh?” WILLKs con-
sults the footman, and the footman says, the gardener has been to see
a man in the village about it, and it can't be managed to-day. All the
dogs are at breakfast, whining for bits.
Happy Thoughº-Politic to feed strange dogs. $º the bulldog.
Terrier still vicious. BooDELS i. “Oh, he’ll soon know you.”
I hope he will : I hate a dog who follows you, and then flies at your
legs. BooDELs says, “Well, if we don't drag the pond, you’d like to
get on with your work, eh?” . With Typical Developments? Certainly:
very much. BooDELs is fond of literature, and says that I can go to
my room, and shan’t be disturbed all day. I observe, I should like
to get to work at once. Just 9:30: capital time. I show him that I
can do a good deal to Chapter One between 9:30 and 1. He is glad to
hear it; and I tell him that, if he likes, I’ll read what I’ve done to
him in the evening. He says “he should like that.” I say, “I won’t,
if it, bores you.” He answers, “Bore me ! I should be delighted!”
I tell him I like reading out loud to an appreciative friend, because he
can give advice. He says, “Yes,” rather quickly, and prººf. One
turn, just as far as the pond, before I sit down to work. think I
ought to get to work: *. how far is the pond?, “Not a hundred
yards, or so.” Very well; just one turn, and then in. “With a
cigarº" Well, p'raps, a very mild cigar. We are at the garden door.
9:40–Excellent time. Still at the garden door. The butler and
the footman have been looking for BooDELs’ little stick with a notch
in it. Boonels says “It’s very extraordinary they can't leave that stick
alone.” That being found (in BooDELs' bed-room, by the way), we
want the matches. Butler thought they were in the study. Footman
(who is followed everywhere by all the 3. gs while clearing away) recol-
lects seeing them there last night. Thinks ANNE, the housemaid, must
have taken them, Will ask her. BooDELs says, “It’s very extraor.
dinary they can't leave the matches alone.” ANNE, from a distance—
voice only heard—says, “she ain't touched them ever since they
were put back last night.”. Being appealed to before the footman
and butler, I say, “I think I recollect them in the study,”—trying to
ºte everybody. Subsequently, WILLKs finds them in BôoDELs'
ed-room.
10–Now, then, for one turn, and then in to work hard at my MS.
WILLks asks BooDELs, “Will he speak to the cook about dinner?”
“Oh, yes,” BooDEIs answers, “ or you won't get any dinner.” This to
me, good humouredly. , I laugh (stupid joke, really), and say, “Well
make haste!” While he’s away, I think of the first sentence fii
write when I get in, so as not to waste time, “In the very earliest
and darkest ages of our ancient earth—” when BooDELs comes back
quickly, to hear if I like turbot. Yes, I don't care. , Because there's
a man come with turbot. “One can't get,” he explains, “fish regu-
larly in the country.” I answer, “Oh, anything.” He says “I’d
better come and see the turbot. He’s no judge.” I protest, “No
more am I.” But he thinks, at all events, Tºd better see ‘em. Ti
assent, “Very well.”. He says, “What?” (He must be deaf some-
times.) I explain that I, only said “Very well.” We go to the
turbot man. The cook is already there. We are joined by the butler.

“I fail to apprehend you,” I returned. “Attendance I understand

LADIES” LABOUR AND THE POOR.
“WHAT shall I do with my money?” is a question one sees adver-
tised, and a question which most people have small trouble in answering;
for most people find the needful expenses of their living are quite
º to swallow up what money they can earn, Some people, how.
ever, have some money they can spare, and which from time to time
they feel desirous to invest. Now, there are few better investments
than judicious works of charity, which are sure to bear good interest
both in this world and the next. Such, for instance, are the works of
the Ladies' Sanitary Association, which is urgently in need of an
addition to its funds. [N.B. 8, Pont Street, Belgrave Square, is where
the money should be sent.] -
The chief aim of this Society is to help the poor to live in cleanli-
ness, and health, and teach them to appreciate the value of clean
dwellings, clean habits, and clean dress. It also aims to give them
some good lessons in economy, and teach them to avoid the extrava-
#.” of finery, and to try by careful cookery to prevent the waste of
ood. Now that the black cholera and pallid death are knockin
at our doors, how great is the good done by a Society like this
By the labours of the ladies who undertake its management, and the
money of subscribers entrusted to its care, it visits our sick poor, and
distributes soap and flannels, brooms and disinfecting fluids, in the
neighbourhoods in need of them. It calls remediary notice to the
.# and sickness caused by crowded º and saves poor
rls from stitching all day long in stifling rooms. It provides a home
or servants when they are out of place, and teaches mothers how to
nurse, and their daughters how to cook. oreover, Gentlemen of
England who live at home at ease, just listen to this further informa.
tion, if you please:–
“The Committee have sent out during the last five seasons one thousand three
hundred and fifty-eight parties of the poorest children in London, from the º
Schools, &c., into the Parks, for fresh air and healthful recreation, providing toys,
and where the parents cannot afford it, giving a slice of bread to be eaten in the
Parks. Paying guides, who are generally the masters and mistresses of the
schools, to conduct the children to the Parks, and keep them there three or four
hours, twice in each week, during the summer months, in each year. Thus, ninety-
*‘....: eight hundred and fifty-two poor children have been benefited in health
and spirits.
Just think what it must be to live a little child in London, and have
nothing but the pavement, and the gutter for a play-ground ! And
just think that there are thousands of P. children now in London
who, but for, the kind helping hand of charity to lead them, would
never have the pleasure of a gambol in the parks! Just think, too,
how much freer would, the pavements be for walking on, were the
little ones who cluster there more frequently . to fitter places
for their play ! And then just read, and ponder on the following appeal:—
“Funds are *:: required to carry on the work." The Committee closed their
financial year with £18 in hand. This season the Lectures have been ped.
Next season the Park Parties must be stopped, unless this appeal is responded to.
If cheques be not sent in, forthwith, a check, is put to sending out
poor children for fresh air. Well, our City friends inform us that,
although the Bank has recently reduced its rate of discount, money
still is tight. But we trust that there are people, who will set loose their
purse-strings, and if only from politeness give aid to these good ladies
in doing their good Wºź.
Sporting Extraordinary.
THE following story is told of a gentleman well known in sporting
circles. Being mounted on his thorough-bred hunter, on which he
had backed himself to take any, thing, he rode up to an unfur;
mished five-storied house, and took it. Both horse and rider returned
home in perfect safety.

THERE is an ancient Joe that tells
How once an Irish steward,
Let fall the tea-pot overboard,
One morning when it blew hard.
He to the Skipper went forthwith
And popped this question flying—
“Captain dear, can a thing be lost
When ye know where it’s lyin’?”
“No!, you Blest fool!” the Captain roared;
“Ah, thin'" quoth PAT, quite gay—
“Sorra the pot’s lost, 'tis, I know,
At bottom of the say.”

But now its breed is crost;

Henceforward, is not lost.

And when GLAss spoke of catching it,
The world laughed, by direction:
“GLAss must be cracked; must be a Glass
With no power of reflection
“Mrs. GLAssE writes—‘first, catch your hare,’
Then dishes it for table;
But Mr. GLAss, unlike Madame,
Forgets “First, catch your cable.”
“Suppose it caught, to lift that weight
From that depth perpendicular!
“Ridiculous” can’t be compared,
Or, we’d ask, ‘What’s ridicular?’”
So when three ships, with three-mile lines,
For this strange catch went fishing,
They’d little of BULL's faith or hope,
Tho' much of his good-wishing.
When, lo, this deep-sea fishing proved
An easy business quite :
Scarce a day passed but every ship
Got, at the least, one bight.
Hooked, raised, hauled in from ocean's bed,
Spliced, sheathed with hempen thrum;
The wire, for all its sleep profound,
Froved neither dead no dumbi
All the year, in Valentia's Bay,
An anxious watch they kept;
And they that watched, though far away,
Heard it talk, as it slept,
Broken, unmeaning sounds, but now
It uttered sense again;
Spoke all the better, for the long
Deep snooze that it had ta'en.

whose poetical alti-

}. raph in the
eekly Dispatch:- |h
“Some tender-hearted people in Edinburgh have recently established a home for
cats, which may have been abandoned by their owners. As it is considered that
the existing laws afford no protection to poor puss, it has been suggested that the
name and address of every person guilty of the atrocity of turning their cats into
the street shall be º to the world without reg
of rank, position, or pro-
fession.”
The founders of a home for houseless cats would doubtless be
inclined to go farther than the infliction of mere exposure on an
wretch convicted of trying to turn a cat out-of-doors. They woul
perhaps even be inclined to doom, if they could, such a barbarous
person to a visitation of the cat with a plurality of tails. But actually
to perpetrate the barbarity of turning a cat out-of-doors is practically
impossible. Cats may be shut out of the house, but they always come
back again, and if people attempt to starve them out, they steal.
Moreover, anybody capable of turning a cat into the street would also
be capable of killing it, and would prefer that more certain way of
getting rid of the cat. -
Deserted dogs can be distinguished º .."; but the recog-
nition of a deserted cat must be a matter of some difficulty. Suppose
the necessary officers of a Cats' Home were commissioned to “com:
rehend all vagrom.” cats, and did so, they would deprive many an old
ady of a cherished darling abroad on a mere excursion. Their em-
ployment, by the way, would be hazardous, involving many perilous
adventures on the tiles, and particularly the risk of getting mistaken
for burglars and taken up, or perhaps shot. The tender-hearted
founders of a home for cats may, however, in some measure realise
their amiable purpose by saving kittens from being drowned, and thus
preventing the crime of catulicide, which, there is reason to believe, is
on the increase.
What sort of creatures can those be who conceived the foundation
of a home for cats? Doubtless a sort actuated by a strong affection
for their fellow creatures. It is not perhaps too much to surmise that
they are what in language more familiar than respectful is called a set
of old tabbies. Accordingly they may be considered to evince a #.
love of their species, and whatever may be thqught of their headsthere
can be no question that they are endowed with feline hearts.
PARSIMONY AND POTATOES.
WHERE is the reverend gentleman who once created a sensation by
saying that the Irish rejoiced in º: If still in the land of the
living, he must surely be the author of the annexed advertisement in
the Ecclesiastical Gazette:–
WANº. by a Clergyman in the Country, the DUTY of a small
Agricultural (population 160) R. for Six Months from the
esent time. Duty º” ht, the Advertiser offers only a large furnished
ouse and Fº with pºtatoes. One female servant left in the house. Neighbour-
hood very healthy.-Apply to R. M., &c., &c., Devizes, Wilts.
It has been said that culinary skill in general may be measured by
ability to cook a pºtato. If that is, true, and the one female servant
left in the house above advertised, to cook the potatoes which are to
constitute its ºccupant's stipend, can cook them well, she will be up to
coqking anything else, in case he can afford to find himself in meat,
and is not content to rejoice in potatoes. Perhaps it is that, as able to
cook a potato, therefore as a good cook, therefore as a valuable woman,
she is mentioned as part of the consideration proposed in lieu of money.
But an offer of potatoes, for pay can only be addressed to a curate
out of place, whom the high price of butcher's meat has compelled to
be a vegetarian. However, Fº are kidneys., There is the
walnut-leaf kidney, the ash-leaf kidney, the Lancashire kidney, and a
kidney which is a genuine kidney, although it is named the fluke kidney.
There are also red-nosed, kidneys, though they are scarce now, like
red-nosed Rectors. - -
Now the one servant left in the house may be competent to devil
this sort of kidneys for the poor parson whom hunger may constrain
to accept a very light duty for a very small remuneration, and then it
may be possible for him to rejoice in potatoes exceedingly. But as to
the reverend advertiser for a potato-fed curate, though the proprietor
of a garden, he can be no gardener, because, as MR. BERNAL Osborne
might say, he does not know the difference between potatoes and salary.
TEMPERANCE AND COOKERY.
MAN has been defined to be an animal that cooks; and a man who
is content to eat his food uncooked may be deemed to be degraded to
the level of the beasts. Yet Englishmen in general know nothing
about cookery, and even in the present era of enlightenment are
satisfied with dining upon underdone potatoes and a bit of half-raw
beef. In England i. is mostly, but half-cooked in the kitchen, and
the º process is º continued by the agency of drink.
An Englishman when dining lights a spirit lamp inside him, and
imbibes sufficient alcohol to cook and partly make digestible the viands
e consumes. Such cookery, however, must always be imperfect, and
must lead to indigestion and the evils in its train. Hence one often
hears an Englishman complaining of dyspepsia, and, one finds the
English journals, teeming with advertisements of medicines for the
stomach-ache and biliary complaints: -
Moreover, light inward, spirit lamps tempts, people to intem-
perance, and men who find a drop of brandy n for their comfort
are tempted not infrequently to take a drop too much. Instead, then,
of denouncing, the vice of insobriety, our teetotallers should preach
ainst the evils of bad cookery, and endeavour to persuade people to
pledge their word of honour not to put up with bad cooks. On the
plea that men are tempted to habits of intemperance Hº ill-
cooked viands given them to eat, let a national appeal be made to
Englishmen in general no longer to submit to eat their dinners badly
dressed. Not merely health but wealth is wasted by bad cookery, and
any Englishman with sense enough to take the pledge againstit would
soon find himself improved both in his person and his purse.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON NDON I15
CH
ARTEMUS WARD IN LONDON.
MR. PUNCH, MY DEAR SIR,
It is now some two weeks since a rayther strange lookin
man engaged 'partments at the Greenlion. He stated he was from the
celebrated United States, but beyond this he said nothin. He seem'd
to prefer sollytood. . He remained mostly in his room, and whenever
he did show hisself he walkt in a moody and morose manner in the
arding, with his hed bowed down and his arms foldid across his brest.
#. reminded me sumwhat of the celebrated but onbappy Mr. Haller,
in the cheerful play of The Stranger. This man puzzled me. I’d been
puzzled afore several times, but never so severally as, now. Mine. Ost
of the Greenlion said I must interrigate this strange bein, who claimed
to be my countryman, “He hasn't called for a drop of beer since he’s
been in this ere Ouse,” said the landlord: “I look to you,” he added,
“to clear up this dark, this orful mistry !”
I wringed the lan'lord's honest hand, and told him to consider the
mistry cleared up.
I gained axes to the misterus bein’s room, and by talkin sweet to
him for a few minits, I found out who he was... Then returnin to the
lan’lord, who was nervisly pacin up and down the bar, I said,
“Sweet Rolando, don't tremble no more I’ve torn the marsk
from the hawty stranger's face, and dived into the recesses of his
inmost sole ! He's a Trans-Mejim l’”
I’d been to the Beefanham theatre the previs evenin, and probly the
drammer I saw affected me, because, I’m not in the habit of goin on as
per above. I like the Beefanham theatre very much indeed, because
there a enthoosiastic lover of the theatre like myself can unite, the
legitermit drammer with fish. Thus, while your enrapterd soul drinks
in the lorfty and noble sentences of the gifted artists, you can eat a
biled mack'ril jest as comfor’bly as in your own house. I felt, con-
strained, however, to tell a fond mother who sot immegitly behind me,
and who was accompanied by a gin bottle and a young infant—I felt
constraned to tell that mother, when her infant playfully mingled a
rayther oily mack'ril with the little hair which is left on my venerbſched
that I had a bottle of scented hair oil at home, which on the whole i
tho't I preferred to that which her orfspring was greasin me with.
This Hići the excellent female, and she said, “Git out! You never
was a infank yourself, I's j Oh no!, You was too good, to be a
infank you was You slid into the world all ready grow’d, didn't you!
Git out !” “No, Madam,” I -
was a luvly child. Peple used to come in large and enthoosiastic
crowds from all parts of the country to see me, I was such a sweet and
intel'gent infant. The excitement was so intens, in fack, that a extra
hotel was startid in the town to accommodate the peple who thronged
to my cradle.” Havin finished these troothful statemints, I smilt
sweetly on the worthy, female. She said, “Drat you, what, do you
come a-chaffin me for,” and the estymible. woman, was really gettin
furis, when I mollyfied her by praisin her child, and by axin pardin for
all I’d said. “This little gal,” I observed, “ this surprisingly luyly
gali. When the mºther said...It's tºother sect is hºir; it's a boy.”
“Wall,” I said, “then this little boy, whose eye is like a eagle a-soar-
ing proudly in the azure sky, will someday be a man, if he don't choke
hisself to łºń in childhood's sunny hours with a smelt, or a bloater,
or some other dreſſul, calamity. How surblime the tho’t, my dear
Madam, that this infant as you fondle on your knee on this, night, ma
w up into a free and independent citizen, whose vote will be wort
from ten tºwn pounds, accordin as suffrages may range at that
o rid' '
J *... now return, jentle reader, to the lan'lord of the Greenlion,
who we left in the bar in a state of i. and perspire. Rubbin his
hot face with a red hankercher, he said, “Is the strange bein a
American.”
... A Giºral? xx
“A Colonial?”
º No.”
“A Majer?”
“Not a Majer.”
“A Capting.”
“He is not.”
“A leftenant P”
“Not even that.” -
“Then,” said the lan'lord of the Greenlion, “you ar deceeved He
is no countryman of yours.”
4. not ** I said.
“I tell you, Sir,” said the lan'lord. “My son-in-law is employed
in a bankin house where ev’ry American as comes to these shores goes
to git his drafts casht, and he says that not one has arrived on these
shores durin the last 18 months as wasn't a Gen'ral, a Colonial, a
Majer, a Capting, or a leftenant! This man, as I said afore, has
deceeved you! He's a impostuer!” - -
I reeled into a chair. For a minit I was speechlis. At length I mur-
replied, “I too was once a infant I h
merd, “Alars! I fear it is too troo! Even I was a Capting of the
Home Gards.”
... To be sure,” said the lan'lord; “you all do it, over there.”
“Wall,” I said, “whatever nation this person belongs to, “we may
as well go and hear him lectur this evenin. He is one of these spirit
fellers-he is a Trans-Mejim, and when he slings hisself into a trans
state, he says the sperrits of departed great men talk through him.
He says that to-night sev’rilem'nent persons will speak through him—
among others, CROMWELL.”
“And this MR. CROMWELL–is he dead?” said the lan'lord.
I told him that QLIVER was no more.
“It's a umbug,” said the lan'lord; to which I replied that we’d
best go and see, and we went....We was late, on accounts of the
lan'lord's extensiv. acquaintans with the public house keepers along the
road, and the hall was some two miles distant, but we got there at
last. The hall was about half full, and the Mejim was just then
assumin’ to be BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, who was speakin about the
Atlantic Cable.
He said the Cable was really a merrytorious affair, and that messiges
could be sent to America, and there was no doubt about their gettin
there in the course of a week or two, which he said was a beautiful
idear, and much quicker than by steamer or canal-boat. It struck me
that if this was FRANKLIN aspiritooal life hadn't improved the old gentle-
man's intellecks particly.
The audiens was mostly composed of rayther palełº, whose eyes
I tho’t rolled round in a somewhat wild manner. But they was well.
behaved, and the females kept saying, “How beautiful! What a
surblime thing it is,” et cetry, et cetry. Among the females was one
who was a fair and rosy young woman. She sot on the same seat we did,
and the lan'lord of the č. ion, whose frekent intervoos with other
lan'lords that evenin had been too much for him, fastened his left eye
on the fair and rosy young person, and smilin lovinly upon her, said
“You may º: me, my dear, four-penny-worth of gin-cold gin. i
take it cold, because—”
here was cries of “Silence | Shame! Put him out ! the Skoffer l’’
... Ain' we at the Spºtted Boar?” the lan'lord hºarsely whisperd.
. “No,” I answerd, “It’s another kind of bore, Lis'en. CROMWELL
is goin’ to speak through our inspired fren', now.” -
“Is he?” said the lan’lord—“is he? Wall, I’ve suthin to say,
also. Was this CROMWELL a licensed vittler P’’
“Not that I ever heard,” I anserd. - -
“I’m sorry for that,” said the lan'lord with a sigh; “but you think
e was a man who would wish to see licensed vittlers respected in
their rights? ".
O -
“Wall,” said the lan'lord, jest you keep a eye on me.” Then risin
to his feet he said, in a somewhat husky yet tol’bly distink voice,
“MR. CRUMBWELL | *
“CROMWELL | * I cried.
“Yes, MR. CROMWELL : that’s the man I mean, MR. CROMBLE |
won’t you please advise that gen’l’man who you’re talkin through ;
won't you advise 'im during your,elekant speech to settle his bill at
my 'ouse to-night, MR. CRUMBLEs,” said the lan'lord, glarin’ savigel
round on the º “...because if he don't, there’ll be a punched 'e
to be seen at the Greenlion, where I don't want no more of this everlastin
nonsens. I’ll talk through 'im'. Here’s a sperrit,” said the lan'lord,
a smile once more beamin on his face, “whic will talk through him
like a Dutch father I’m the sperrit for you, young feller!” “You’re
a helthy old sperret,” I remarkt; and then I saw the necessity of
gettin him out of the hall. The wimin was yellin and screamin, and
the men was hollerin’ perlice. A perliceman really came and collerd
my fat fren. “It’s only a fit, SIR RICHARD,” I said. always call
the perlice SIR RICHARD. It pleases them to think I’m the victim of
a deloosion; and they always treat me perlitely. This one did, cer-
tiny, for he let us go. We saw no more of the Trans-Mejim.
It’s diffikilt, of course, to say how long these noosances will be
allowed to prowl round. i should say, however, if pressed for a anser
that they will prob'ly continner on jest about as long as they can find
peple to lis'en to 'em. Am I right -

Poor plodding John BULL sadly labours
To do some things done by his neighbours;
To match their battalions
Of fighting rascallions,
And cope with their rifles and sabres;
To play the piano and fiddle;
In Art his position is middle;
A statue he never

His claim to be reckon

Reposing on trial by Jury.
Oh, fond is that cherished delusion!
How often, in stupid confusion,

regret it, but he does. BooDELs used to sit for hours either listening
to me reading my manuscripts to him, or enjoying my conji.
Now he doesn’t, and has taken to personal remarks, which he calls
repartee (hate it), and he and MILBURD play at Clown and Pantaloon
in the passage. It’s really waste of life and talents." " " " Talking
of that, let me get to work.
11 o'clock, A.M.–By the exact time, which I have just given BooDELs
from the top of the stairs. Qught to have begun at nine. Good room
for writing my ſcal Developments in. View of a lawn. No noise.
BooDELs said I should be undisturbed, and quite alone. I like that in
BooDELs; he is considerate, when he sees you are in earnest. Delight-
ful morning : just enough breeze to cause a sigh through the trees.
N.B. Mustn't forget “breeze” and “trees” when I write a serenade.
Mentioned this idea;. subsequently, on a lovely moonlight night, to
IIBURD, who immediately made a hideous grimace, and said, “Yah!
yah yah! Ho!” with a sort of steam-engine whistle, “Niggar ! are
§. dar?, Bolly golly black man, boo!” and then he and BooDELs
oth laughed. What at P I pitied them. BooDELs is really losin

suggested the Ethiopian Serenaders to him.] + +

ancient earth, before even the grand primayal forests could boast the
promise of an º bud, there existed in the inexhaustible self-

moment, in too embryotic a condition for beneficial production.”

to look. The butler says, “No, he don't see it,” begs pardon, and
retires. I hear BooDELs on the landing, saying, “It’s very odd they
can't leave my cigar-case alone!”. The slightes: interruption gets you
out of the swing of ideas. I must try back again. “Man at once pos-
sible and—” Knock at the door. “Come in.” BooDELs puts his
head in, and sings, “Who’s data knocking at de door?” as if that placed
the interruption in a more sociable point of view. It only reminds me
of that idiot, MILBURD.. I think MILBURD copies BooDELs, or Boopºls
MILBJRD. Whichever it is, I hate an imitation, . However, he explains
that “he wouldn't disturb, me without knocking first,” as if he'd
have, disturbed me, more by not knocking. I look as pleasant as
possible; “he wants my advice,” he says, I am flattered; though
if he didn't come to me, old friend, for advice in a difficult matter,
to whom should he go? Not MILBURD. He commences by as 3
“How are you getting on, eh?” and I answer, “Oh, pretty well,

inclined to wander, I bring him back to the point by asking “what he
was going to say to me?” BooDELs waits a minute, *# out of
window, and then says, “What?” (He is getting deaf. If he gets
very deaf, I shall #. away.) I º my question. He replies, “Oh,

about dragging the pºnd a shilling, or not?”
in the question. “Well,” I say, dubiously, “What's he done?”
“Well,” explains BooDELs, “he hasn't exactly done much; but he’s
been up to the pond, and examined it, and so forth, you know.” I say,
decisively, to show that I’m a man of business, “Oh, yes, give him a
shilling,” and take up my pen again, by way of a hint to BooDELs.
“It’s rather too much to give him, eh, for merely º a pond?”
objects BooDELs. I return, settling to write *gain, “Oh, no!” as if
I generally gave double that sum. “What?” says BooDELs. (He

What?” he asks, rather testily. I think he’s in a nasty temper; }.
never know a man well till you stay with him. Happy Thought that.
Ilay down my pen, “Well,” I explain, mildly, because it’s no use
having a row with BooDEIs about this confounded pond, “I meanif the
man has come to-to-or if he merely—why—that is, if the fellow—”
I own I am wandering. , BooDELs, notices it, and says, with some
tinge of annoyance in his tone, “I came to ask your advice; I
j thought you might have attended to me for one minute. Yºu
can’t be so busy as all that.” I feel hurt. Some people, are easily
moved to tears. A little more, and I should be moved to tears.
As he is going out of the door ſhe's hurt, too), he turns back,
somewhat mollified, and asks me, “I say, if I give him a s g,
to-morrow, when he comes with the net, it will do, eh?”, I say, enthu-
siastically, “Yes, that’ll do—the very thing!” which only elicits from
BooDELs a “What?” and I have to repeat, encouragingly, “Yes,
that’s the idea! A shilling to-morrow—capitall” BooDELs, leaves
me, and as he does so I feel a sort of pity for BooDELs, I don't know
why, and then become sensible of a beast of a fly on my neck. Bother!

to see about the pond. BooDLEs wonders “who the other fellow is,”

Let me abstract myself. “Man at once possible—” Knock at the
door. “Come in.” . A tall i. appears in a shooting suit, with
yery long light beard, reddish moustachios and a slouching white hat
in his hand. With him, BooDELs. , I have never seen the tall gentle:
man before: I rise. BooDELs apologises: “I told Captain,”, name I
don't catch, “that we mustn't disturb you, but he said as he’s going
away almost immediately” (by the way, he was here the whole after-
noon and then missed his train) he'd like toº—” Here BoopFLs looks
at the Captain, and that gentleman evidently feeling that his oppor-
tunity has been thrust upon him rather too suddenly, ulls at his
moustache, and says with a short, º: nervous laugh, “Ya-ya, ya-as,
ya, ya..” Not e that MILBURD's boasted #4. delineations, only
that it's natural. “You-ar-don't r-remember me?” No, I don'tremember
him. , I try to, feeling that, I ought to remember, him. I smile
and shake my head. I haven't even the faintest recollection. He is
somewhat taken aback by this non-recognition;, I don't wonder at
it, seeing that I hear, afterwards, how when he thought I was
miles away, he had exclaimed on hearing my name, “Know him!
I should think sq. Ah, I should like to see him again.” He looks at
me, almost º BooDELs looks anyhow, and the tall man
says, half defiantly, “My name’s CAwKER”. His face bothered me,
but his face and his name together have knocked me over.
Feeling that something hearty is expected of me, I say
“Oh, of course, CAwKER! ow are you?” In fact I
nearly overdoing it upon the spot, and calling him Öld Cºwker.
We shake hands heartily, and, I suppose, to myself, that, in the
course of conversation, he’ll let out where the dickens fºve seen
him before. CAWKER laughs very nervously, “Ya-a-a-haven't-a-a
—seen you far.”—(he puts a for, o very often, I notice, but this
doesn’t recall him to #"?'. far an age.” Then he laughs, and
so does BooDELs. y? I answer, steadily, “No, not since—”
and I leave him to fill up the blank, which # does, unsatisfactorily,
with, a laugh. There we stop. After awhile, CAPTAIN CAwkER,
who has been staring at my papers, says cleverly, “ Writing something,
eh P” and laughs. I reply, that I am writing something, “Yes.” He
answers, “Ah, ya-a-as-not much in my line, writing.” I say, “No”
indeed?” flatteringly, to give him the idea that he might do it if he
liked. BOODELs comes to the rescue. It ap CAwkER and I were
schoolfellows. Ah, I know now. He used to be hated, and called
“SNoBBy CAwkER, but I don't remind him of this. “You’re so
altered,” I tell him..." Ya-a-a-as,” he returns, conceitedly, stroking
his red moustache, “Ya-a-a-as. You’re not. I recollect {ij} (here
he turns to BoopFLs, and talks of me) “at school.” Here I begin to
be interested. “He was a little, short, ºft fellow, all suetty.”

I am obliged to laugh; but when he’s gone, I’ll tell BoopFLs that we
used to call him “ Snobby ”CAwkER at school. I wish I hadn't said
he was altered.
BooDELs cuts in. “Well, come along, we mustn't delay you.” CAWKER
(who is a Captain, too! Snobby CAWKER, a Captain'ſ how the Army
must be finº, !) says, ...Ya-as—leave him to his writing, ya-a-as,”
and laughs; I feel as if I will give up writing, there and then, and be
transported for merely one kick at CAwKER. BooDELs wants ČAwker.
to come and take a turn before lunch.

AIR-" Britannia's the Pride of the Ocean.”
BRITANNIA’s the pride of the Ocean,
The home of the brave and the free;
But Yankees it seems have a notion,
That we’re much greater fools than we be.
Two men and a § crossed the briny,
Of course we believe it, we do;
In a boat of two tons, vessel tiny,
And they called it The Red, White and Blue!
And they called, &c., (In Chorus).
In spite of the caviller's malice,
In spite of the doubts on her thrown;
It is now at the Crystial Palace,
And “seeing is believing' you’ll own.
Their dog's tale is lost, a sad thing this!
But the men with their Craft remain, two.
So to the Marines let us sing this
New song of the Red, ite and Blue.
Here’s the Craft of the Red, White and Blue,
Here’s the Craft of the Red, White and Blue.
So to the Marines we’ll go and sing this,
New song of the Red, ite and Blue.
Painful Parallel.
A New book, by a clever author, is announced, with the title, Lost
Among the Wild Men. A cynical friend of ours, who is obliged to stay
in London, and see a good deal of his humble relations, declares that
he can write a more affecting autobiography, to be caiſed found Among
the Tame Men.
SYMBOLISM.
“WESTMINstER ABBEy,” as DEAN STANLEY may have wittily ob:
served the other day, “has been ... ." small Altar-ation.”
It is, indeed, a piece of beautiful symbolism that the new altar-piece of
our Christian Cathedral should be executed in Mosaic.

of a list of the bonds, bills, notes, and securities which KING GEORGE
of HANOVER carried off in his flight from his dominions, and giving
notice that payment of them is suspended. We have heard of
Kings putting themselves in the Gazette—as conquerors, if not as bank.
rupts: but this is the first instance on record, we should suppose, of
one monarch Fº another into the Hue and Cry. KING GEORGE
declares that he has a right to his º and his interest besides;
and so he means to keep the money. He may plausibly contend that
he has as much right to do Hanover out of bonds, as Prussia has to do
Hanover into 'em. If it comes to the question of stealin (as between
KING G. and KING W.)—well, we should observe that there is a good
deal to be said on both sides.
Regiments on the Run.
THE Army and Navy Gazette contains the following announcement:—
* RUNNING DRILL.-We are at last, we believe, about to adopt the “running
drill;" not too soon, considering how long the Continental armies have used it.”
There would be a great necessity for Running Drill if the British
Army could escape from better, organised and better armed foreign
troops by running. If we keep behind Continental nations in the art
of war, we can º expect to flee before them in battle. , Let us run
a-head of them in the race of military improvement, and then Running
Drill will avail us, on occasion, by enabling us to run after them.
Science and Smoke.
At the imminent meeting of the Social Science Congress, ...;
to announcement, “DR. ANgus SMITH will discuss the evils produce
by the non-consumption of smoke.” The learned Lecturer might
suggest that railway companies could, in a great measure, remedy
these evils by the establishment of smoking-carriages.
CHRONOLOGY IN CLERKENWELL.
A GRATIFYING proof of the progress which education has made
among the masses was afforded in a remark made by one of them the
other evening at the meeting held on Clerkenwell Green to denounce
MR. EYRE. One of the orators, though professing himself a Repub-
lican, said the QUEEN was “the best, Sovereign the country had had
since ALFRED THE GREAT.”. For this concession he was reprehended
by another speaker, because it was going so far back as the time of
ALFRED THE GREAT—a period of “about two centuries ago.” A
parallel passage to this occurs in Tristram Shandy:-
“‘They are Socrates's children,” said my Uncle Toby. . . . " He has been dead
a hundred years ago,' replied my mother.'"
The critical democrat in the concourse on Clerkenwell Green was
evidently a humourist and had read STERNE.

the ocean by your side, and tracing your dear name on the sands ! But
fate and a father have placed a barrier between us. So I pace up and
down before the old house in T-Square, and look up at a certain
dormitory on the second story—in no state of elevation you may be

tender was not accepted? After telling him that it was the summit,
the pinnacle of my ambition to win you as my wife, did he not answer
that he considered I ought not to aspire to your hand until the state-
ment of my pecuniary means (as he worded it) was more satisfactory
and, meanwhile, requested me to discontinue my pointed attentions

for the report of another and more fortunate ºpetº, but that I
still fill the same niche in your affections I ever did? For, CAROLINE,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HAPPY THOUGHTS.
(My stay at Boodels comes to an abrupt termination.)
N this evening I will retire to my
room early, to work at Typical
Developments, Chap. I., Book I,
Volume L, Section I., Paragraph
No. 3. I feel that if I don't do it
now, while I am in the vein, I
never shall.

shall leave BooDELs, unless he
drags the pond to-morrow, because
that’s what I came down for.
BooDELs praises MILBURD in his
absence, as if he was disparagin
ne. I don't like the tone. Sha
leave BooDELs unless he drags the
- pond to-morrow.
I am now sitting with my note-book in my hand, so as not to waste
my time, watching BooDEIS. BooDELs is apparently going to sleep in
his arm-chair. Good. When BooDELs is asleep, I shall retire very
|. to my room. It’s a bad habit, that of BooDELs', sleeping after
nner. He is only dozing; if I move, he’ll wake. fºil pretend to
read; but I’ll watch. I'am going to think, so as not to waste time.
Can't fix my thoughts. Something flits through my brain about Meso-
potamia, then fire-irons,—then cockles, then—
* + - + + + + +
I’ve been asleep. BooDELs has gone.
11 P.M.–Another evening passed, and no Typical Developments done.
WILLKs, the butler, appears with my bed, candle, and says that, his
master is smoking a cigar, up-stairs. ... I'll just say “good night” to
him, and then, to work—to work in the silent night—at Typical De-
velopments, Vol. I, Book I, Section I., Chapter I, Paragraph No. 2.
I find BooDELs on a sofa, with all his dogs. They jump up, and
bark at me; all, except the bulldog, who creeps round me, smelling

his noise makes, BooDELs quite lively; . He says, Oh, don't go to
bed yet.”. I plead “work.” He says, “Bring it in here.” Shan't I
disturb him “Not in the least: he'd like it; wants to hear how
I’m getting on.'... I like BooDEls when you’ve got him alone; he’s
himself then. Evil MILBURDs corrupt good BooDELs. I think of
this while I fetch my MS. My paper is spread out: pens, ink, all
ready.
# last sentence where I left off commences, “Man at once possible
and impossible-–" I stick there. , BooDELs is petting the dogs,
and it distracts me. Seeing that it has, this effect, BooDELs consi.
derately tells the dogs to lie down, and then he smokes solemnly.
Somehow, this distracts me more than ever... I feel a strong desire to
talk. I must get myself into the swing. Would BooDEI's mind my
reading aloud just to get myself into the swing P “No ; he’d like it
immensely.”
Happy Thought—Always try to interest your host.
I tell him that I consider him as representing a section of the public,
and I should like to have his opinion. “Candidly?” he asks. “Can
didly,” I answer, “as a friend.” He says, “Very well; fire away.” I
fire away. I read, what I’ve done. * * * * Well, how does he like
it? “ *. he asks. Yes, of course. Well, then, he doesn't
like it at all. He doesn't set up for a judge, he admits... I should think
not. BooDELs a judge of this sort of thing ! Good heavens ! I te
him that I don't think he understands it. He answers, rather tetchily,
“Very likely not.”. I ask what passage he finds fault, with He
answers...that “he dislikes, the idea,”, I say, “Hang it! dislike the
idea! That’s confoundedly illogical.” He replies, that “he’s not a
logician; and if he'd known I would have got so angry on hearing an
honest opinion, why—",“Angry! No, dash it! I'm not angry;
because there’s nothing I like to hear better than an honest opinion;
but I mean to say that if he dislikes this of mine, why, he wouldn't
care about BUCKLE's History 3. Civilisation, or DARwin’s ‘Book’”
(I forget the name, so I call it “book”), “ or HUME, or JEREMY BEN-
THAM” (I like saying Jºy," it sºunds familiar),...or the old
metaphysical writers” (I think this will shake him a little), “or, in
fact, any of those fellows.” . I didn't want to say “fellows,” feeling
that it rather lowered the tone of my argument. BooDELs rejoins,
sharply, “Good heavens ! you don't mean to say you put yourselſ on a
#. with DARwiN, and BuckLE, and BENTHAM? " I don’t say I do.
e says, “What }*I repeat, loudly, “I don't say I do.” He takes
me up—he is very nasty to-night, “Do, indeed! I should think not.”
He aids, “that he doesn't know what I mean by Typical Developments,
and he supposes that...I don't, either.” I repress myself—he is my
host-and luckily recollecting a repartee of SheridAN’s, or some one's,
which I've used successfully on several occasions, I say, with quiet
satire, “My dear fellow, I can't find you books and brains, too.”

Having said it, it strikes me that I hadn't got the repartee quite right.
BooDE is returns, “Find brains for me / You must, have sufficient
difficulty in providing yourself with that article.” [N.B. Qn calm con-
sideration, this is such an evident reply that I don't think I could have
got my repartee right. If I did say it right, why didn't some one make
that reply to SHERIDAN ?
Happy Thought.—The wits of whom we hear so much were not such
very sharp fellows, after all. For Typical Developments, Chapter XIII.,
when I get to it.]
Silence. Can't see the answer to BooDELs’ repartee. There must
be one. Boodels takes his candle to go to bed. We shake hands.
He’s a good fellow, after all, only he oughtn't to talk about what he
doesn't understand. I regret, to myself, while shaking hands, that I
can't think of an answer to BQQDels' repartee. ... Something about
“his not having any brains” would do it, but I can't see my way. He
makes a discovery. We’ve been talking so much, he’s quite forgotten
to ring for WILLks to take the dogs away. All servants in bed now.
The pug always sleeps in his (BooDELs”) room, but the ºf and
the terrier ought to be outside. I propose letting, 'em out. It ap-
;: we can't without disturbing the entire household in order to get
the keys.
A. iºry thought, as he calls it, strikes BooDELs. “He will take
the pug and the terrier to his room, and I shall take the bulldog and
the skye to mine.” He says, “it’s better than disturbing the whole
household.” I don't think so, but, under the circumstances, won't
make an objection. I hope the bulldog will settle, the matter for him-
self, by refusing to follow me. This difficulty is obviated by BoopFis
carrying him. BooDELs wishes me “good night,” and retires with his
pug and the terrier.
12:30.-I am alone. The ...; and the skye have not moved from
the door....The skye is sniffing, and the bull is watching me, mistrust;

sit down to write. While brushing my hair, I wish, for the fourth

talms.
Now, for an hour's quiet work...","... ." Both dogs have taken to
sniffing, or whining, alternately. This’ll drive me distracted, I don't
like to turn them out in the passage, BooDELs is so particular about
his dogs. P'rhaps they’ll tire themselves out. Let me write. “Man

of hitherto conflicting natural particles. an was developed, slowly,
among the ruins of a mammoth world, to rule the brute, creation, to

glad to see me again, MILBURD makes an ass of himself by pretending
to embrace me and then cry bitterly. - - - -
Happy Thought—Never ask a friend's opinion on one's original MS.
Leads to difficulties.
Happy Thought in Railway Carriage—I’ve thought of the answer to
BooDELs' repartee. When he said that about... my not being able to
find him in brains,” I ought, to have said, “Brains! don't talk of
what you know nothing about.” That would have done him; I wish
I was quicker at thinking of these things. I must practise repºrtee.
Happy Thought—Having nothing to do in the carriage, I’ll begin
practising repartee with myself, in my note-book.
Let’s suppose cases. 1st Hypothesis. Some one says to me “What a
fool you are " Now, what’s the repartee for that I don't know
what I should say exactly. There must be an answer to it of some
sort. To return “Not such a fool, as you are,” sounds rather weak;
at least it isn't the brilliant style of repartee that I want to have at my
fingers' ends. I’ll try it on somebody presently, and see what he says.
Better try it on a boy; some sharp lad, not too big.
Suppose another. 2d Hypothesis. Some one says to me, “Why you’ve
got no more brains than a cat.” What should I reply to that. Some:
thing about “cat:” I don’t, quite see what, but that’s the line of
thought for the repartee to that. Odd, how slow I am at this sort of
thing: I must practise.
Happy Thought.—As I can't see any little boy, I'll try “What a fool

we were moving on, but we were only taking on fresh carriages or
something, and came back to the same place. The man, a herculean
porter, was at my window again in a second, very angry. “If I’d
come out there” (he meant on the platform) “he’d show me if he was
a fool or not. He got quite a crowd round the door. I couldn’t
give him a shilling because everyone was looking. The station-master
came up for my name and address. ...I tried to explain that it was
merely a sort of witticism, but the Policeman, with the station-master,
said it was Wilſº provoking an assault. The porter wouldn't take an

of it in strong language. He finished up by crying out, at the top of
his voice, “Call yourself a man! Why, I'm blanked if I ain’t seen a

shout of laughter from every one at this, and he drove off before I could

adulteration stop

bread and butter

terated coffee. Then
the bed on which
we toss and tumble
in the pangs of in-
digestion is stuffed,
we may discover
with" adulterated
feathers, and finally,
the doctor whom we send for in the morning makes, up his pre-
scription with adulterated drugs. Nor is our º: the only part
attacked. We wear upon our backs adulterated coats, and adulte.
rated silk is the material of our neckcloths. Our linen, is washed weekl
with adulterated soap, and our boots are daily polished, not with bril-
liant EveRETT's—but, with adulterated blacking. #alf of what we
read is written in adulterated, English, scraps of French and Latin
being needlessly lugged in; adulterated pictures are vamped up for
our eyes, while our ears are sorely tried with adulterated music.
Musical adulteration is performed in this wise. Somebody, without
the brains to write an air himself lays hold of one composed by some
more gifted writer. This he twists and turns about, first in one key,
then another, putting what should be the treble in the bass, now
whispering the tune in the softest of pianos, and then thundering it
forth in the noisiest of fortes, keeping up the while a hop-and-skip-and-
jump accompaniment, which so effectually disguises the melody in
treatment that they who know it best can with difficulty recognise it.
All its beauties are disfigured, distorted and destroyed, and a simple
c ing air becomes a º: piece of senseless jingle-jangle. When
his work is published, the adulterator calls it a “Theme with Varia-
tions;” and if he have, a name for the concoction of such rubbish,
thousands, of pianos will be thumped with the poor tune until it is
supplanted by some newer “composition.”
What wonder that when girls are taught to practise stuff like this
they lose all taste for music, and buy, whatever trash their teachers
choose to foist upon them? Playing brainless music is as weakening
to the mind as reading senseless novels, and for the health of female
intellects there ought to be a social Act of Parliament to stop it. If
the pains young ladies take in learning how to knock a tune about on
the piano were devoted to such works as those of MENDELssoHN and
BEETHoveN, their minds as well as fingers would in some measure
stretched, and their time would be by no means unprofitably spent.
There is a real pleasure in striving to interpret and give a proper
utterance to the thoughts of great musicians, and both the player and
the hearers may be benefited by them. But in studying a §.
“air with variations,”, not mind but merely mechanism is the thin
required, and all the player aims at is dexterity of fingers. Instead.o
jºjº to these musical gymnastics on account of the agility
and skill which are displayed in them, nine people out of ten who have
the benefit of hearing them must think it a great pity that so much
time has been wasted on what gives so little pleasure when it is
achieved. Watch the faces in a drawing-room when Miss THUMPING-
TON, performs one of these acrobatic morceaur, and you will see the
shade of boredom spreading as she plays, and that every one will look
relieved and . when she finishes. “The Battle of Prague’—or
Plague—was bad enough to have to listen to, but these “airs with
variations” are infinitely worse; for one can’t help feeling savage that
the themes of a great master should be put to such a use. For all who
have a hand in this adulterated music (whether they be writers, pub-
lishers, or players) Punch wishes that a Cave of Trophonius were
handy, whence Silence might be prayed to take all sound out of their
works. Blondinism on pianos is a misuse of dexterity; and as for
giving any praise because adulterated music is difficult to play, Punch
inclines with DR. Johnson to wish it were impossible.
SOWEREIGN ALLEY.
As down in sº Alley
For “sugar.” I did go,
Admiring of the gutters
Which in that alley flow,
I there did meet a voter,
And unto him did say,
“Beest thee engaged on either side?
Come tell me now, I pray.”
I ben’t engaged on either side,
I solemnly declare;
For I’ve took this here one's money,
And means to vote that there.
BEAR AND EAGLE.
According to a telegram which arrived the other day, from St.
Petersburg, at a farewell banquet lately given at that capital in honour
of the United States Embassy, PRINCE GoRTschakoff made a speech
wherein he expressed his confidence in the permanent duration of a
good understanding between North America and Russia, and said, in
addition: – “This good understanding is neither a danger nor a
menace to other nations, and is dictated neither by ambitious or covert
designs.” . Of course the Prince made this declaration with profound
gravity. If a Russian dinner is always a diner a la Russe, at which the
#. are served by Attendants, of course the American Ambassador
ad no opportunity of saying, “Shall I help you to Turkey ** and
enabling the Russian diplomatist to reply, “Thank you—perhaps you
would like to take Canada.”

THEY wouldn’t let me have my leave,

Claimed choice of times, left me to grieve
An August and September thrall!
They had their country-house invites,
Their moors or stubbles, yachts or streams,
Their little tours, their foreign sights,
And I was left to dream my dreams—
To dream of pleasure out of town
And wake to toil, from ten till four;
Doomed civil-servant of the Crown,
Upon a Whitehall second-floor
With everybody out of town,
And nothing even in the Times
To keep the weary yawning down,
From ten's curs'd stroke to four's glad chimes.

“There’s nobody in town, you know!”

Close shutterêd from ground floor to top,
Stare blankly at me, one and all!
“The Park a waste—the swells withdrawn-

Like swallows with the summer gone
To happier fields than I may know.”
So, left behind, I dreamed of joy
for them of dreariness for me,
And deemed my draught without alloy–
The bitterest bitters that could be.
When lo, the weather has come down
As my avenger! Day by day,
I mark the sky’s forbidding frown,
I hear the rain that rains alway.

WORKMEN IN POSSESSION.
OYE who are out on the mountains and moors,
Released from all business, remote from all bores,
How well you are off were you only aware l—
As long as you can, wise ones, stay where you are.
Repose in the lap of aontent far away,
Until you can't sponge any longer, or pay;
Nor homeward return from the game and the grouse,
At least ere the workmen are out of your house.
Poor wretch, whom necessity calls back to Town,
When there his abode he #. turned upside down,
The carpets all up, walls of paper laid bare;
The premises all undergoing repair!
Doors, balusters, passage, with paint are all wet
Your coatsleeves besmeared in the first place you get;
Size mingled with turpentine, grateful perfume
Exhaling, with fragrance pervades every room.
Io, buckets and pails in your way all about:
Steps stan within, doors and ladders without,
Here scattered are paint-pots and brushes, and slabs,
There, stuck in the corners, of putty lie dabs,
There 's tº of highlows about naked floors,
Loud talking, and laughing, and banging of doors;
Continual hammering vexes your ear, w
And ever at eve the men ask you for beer.
You sleep where you can, and your bed-room must do
For sitting-room, study and library too,
our papers a chaos, your books strewn around,
In heaps, on the chest of drawers, table, or ground.
A looking-glass smashed may your fury provoke,
Perhaps a rude fist your barometer broke :
Some damage or loss, more or less you are sure,
When workmen dismantle your house, to endure.
Discomfort, distraction! The wealthy how blest
With leisure to flee and ascend alpine crest |
The time and the money they're able to spare,
Escape smell of paint and breathe fresh mountain air.
But, º; a slope with a footing like glass,
To make a false step and slip down a crevasse,
In what a position the climber would be
One not to be envied, now even, by me.
TOASTED CHEESE.
“TALHAIARN,” of Llanfair, Abergele, North Wales, has written to
the Times a letter in vindication of the Eisteddfod, with special regard to
the Welsh language and Welsh music. He omits to notice the testimon
to both which the divine WILLIAMs (of Welsh extraction evidently
puts into the mouth of Hotspur:-
“Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
And 'tis no marvel, he 's so humorous.
By ºr lady, he's a good musician."
If Welsh is particularly a language of humour and harmony, the

establish in this metropolis a Welsh Comic Opera. There can be no
doubt that a Welsh Opera might be very comic even though meant to
be serious. An overture performed § an orchestra consisting of Welsh
Harps, however, if possible, would be novel. Hitherto the great
Welsh composers have had no theatre for the display of their genius.
“The intention,” says TALHALARN, “of the Eisteddfod is to culti-
vate poetry and music, art and science.”. Another object of Welsh
nationality, might be the cultivation of that excellent vegetable the
leek, which TAIHAIARN, like his compatriot Fluellen, taking up the
cudgel on behalf of his º might compel English %. to eat,

THERA is a deficient supply of seamen for the Merchant Navy. Can

TOO MUCH LEARNING.
If a Pupil wants a good deal for his, or her, or friends' money, let
him matriculate at the London Academy of Music. See here :—
THE LONDON ACADEMY OF MUSIC, St. James's Hall, 28,
Piccadilly.
Principal–PROF. Wylde, Mus.Doc,
Harmony and Composition-DR. WYLDE.
Pianoforte—DR. WYLDE, HERR HEN.slsa, and MR. J. F. BARNETT.
Italian Singing—SIGNORIGARCIA, LABLACHE, Gilah Doni, and Schia A.

The NEXT TERM COMMENCES Oct. 1st. The Academy is for amateurs and pro-
fessional students, ladies and gentlemen. Students residing at a distance can
receive all their lessons on one day.
Fourteen branches of knowledge taught and nineteen masters to teach
them. So far so good and very excellent. But the point to which we
would draw attention is this—"Students residing at a distance can
receive all their lessons on one day.” . We suppose the students would
come up to town, and not have their lessons given them by telegraph.
The Italian singing lesson with SIGNORI GARCIA, LABLACHE, GILAR-
DONI, and SCHIRA at one end of the wire and the pupil at the other
would be an ...i.". M. PETIT would perhaps find more
difficulty in adapting his lessons on Deportment to telegraphic com-
munications. . But as we said before, of course the Pupil comes up to
town, fresh from the country to be touched up in these fourteen
departments of useful knowledge, by the nineteen paid, professors.
Perhaps they will be all waiting in the hall to receive him or her.
DR. WYLDE first with music-paper and pens; HERR HENSLER carrying
a pianoforte, with J. F. BARNETT inside. The Italian professors singing
a quartette, *...*. by the harp-players OBERTHUR and WRIGHT;
while apart from the rest in a corner will be seated at a small table,
wº i.Fuent safety lamp, if necessary, HERRGANZ reading something
at Sight.
Say he or she arrives at 9 o'clock in the morning.
First hour, 9–10. –DR. WYLDE Harmony and Composition.
Second hour, 10–11.-Pianoforte, DR. WYLDE again (piu lento),
HERR HENSLER ºff, J. F. BARNETT (furioso, #.
Third hour, 11–12.-Italian sing: without pianoforte-players for a
change. SIGNOR GARCIA first. SIGNOR LABLACHE who doesn’t quite
approve of SIGNOR GARCIA's method. Then SIGNOR GILARDONI, who
doesn't think much of either of them; and SIGNOR SGHIRA who is un-
teaching what has gone before when the lesson concludes. Five minutes
allowed for refreshment, and the Lady-Superintendent brings in a
supply of wet towels and snuff; or, if for a lady, eau de Cologne. ..
ourth hour, 12–1–Harp; Pupil comes up, smiling, but a little
shaky. MM. OBERTHUR and WRIGHT show their separate ways of
playing. Pupil grateful, but *...* -
% hour, 1–2–When pupil would have lunch, if at home. Lesson
on Organ, by MR. GEORGE Cooper. Pupil glad to play on it with
his or her feet. Pupil wants to smoke the organ pipes; matches re-
moved by MR, Cooper. - -
Sixth hour, 2–3–M. LEMMENs, on Harmonium. Pupil won't let
him get off harmonium. Altercation; introduction of a New Poker.
End of the harmonium. - - -
Seventh hour, 3–4.—SIGNOR REGoNDI arrives with Concertina; Pupil

Eighth hour, 4–5–HERR JANZA comes to teach violin; Pupil plays
Concertina to him. Lady-Superintendent º: for police.
Ninth hour, 5–6.-M. #. looks in at the door, and just shows
the top of his violoncello. Pupil flies at him; end of ninth lesson.
Pupil £º. on the head º friend. Pupil as º better.
'enth hour, 6–7.-SIGNOR MAGGIONI hears Pupil translate the first
scene of an italian opera, “Oh, heavens ! 'tis he ſ Shameless one !”
Eleventh hour, 7–8.2–French lesson. M. ToURRIER enters and says
“Commongvooportyvoo.” Pupil says, “Trabang Myshoo,” an
dances round him. -
Twelfth hour, 8–9.--M. PETIT to teach deportment., Walks, with
Pupil up and down the room. Pupil carries him pick-a-back suddenly.
Finally, M. PETIT undertakes to see him, or her, carefully back again
to the country, say as far as Colwell-Hatchney, where for the future
this highly educated person will reside.

“Though only an amateur in the science, he had discovered the
telescopic planets, and his only instrument was a common opera-

Surely not a common opera-glass. The opera-glass must
have been an uncommon one. A common opera-glass will

THE MEETING OF THE WINES.
A HIGHLY-PRICED Meeting of established old Wines was recently
held at The Green Seal in Cork Street, called together to consider
their "...P. and futureſº. OLD Port, who met with
a most cordial reception, presided, and opened the proceedings by re-
marking that he and his fellow-decanters felt it to be their duty, he
might say their, wine-duty, to broach a subject which, in the privacy
of their particular, bins, and the seclusion of their own saw-dust, they
had long and soberly discussed. Born in the year 20, he was of an
age to remember the good old drinking times, and the contrast between
their convivialities and the effeminate sobriety of the modern mahogany
often racked him with anguish, and 3. him to pipe his eye in
secret sorrow. . But they had not met by the dozen to whine over this
sad change, although he feared the doctrines of those amiable fanatics
the teetotallers, (hisses and confusion,) were being rapidly imbibed by aii
classes, even by the very top crust of societ }. only the other
day he was disturbed by hearing, that a j, eman of high rank
regaled his guests with—ginger cordial. (Here a shudder of horror ran
through the whole wine-party.) No, it was not a selfish motive that had
induced them to exchange the calm quiet of the cellar for the heat and
ferment of the platform, for they had made a pretty good thing out of
the British public, and would have been satisfied to rest tranquil in
their ancestral cobwebs; but a regard for the nerves, the temper, the
jº apparatus, the internal mechanism of the human frame com-
pelled them to warn the nation against those low-priced and pernicious
º with which the kingdom was now flooded, boldly placarded
as Port and Sherry in the windows of every grocer, confectioner, and
licensed victualler, until they, the long-descended wines of genuine
foreign extraction, were ashamed of their names and vintages. The
veteran Port, whose, remarks were hailed with a storm of applause,
and heeltaps, concluded by calling on his friend, Excellent SHERRY,
to address the Meeting. . .
Excellent SHERRY, in his natural dry manner, lamented the decay of
the golden age, protested against others making a butt of him, declared
he was #. and solemnly assured his brother bottles that he
frequently turned pale at the º of the stuff consumed under his
name, especially by ladies and the humbler clergy, to whose consciences
and digestions i. made a most impressive appeal. He closed by saying
that he had a great regard for his poor relation, ALA, but must
entreat him not to suffer himself to be handed round (along with sweet
biscuits) as SHERRY. -
[At this pint in the proceedings the venerable MADEIRA was in-
troduced, having just arrived from a long voyage, and placed in his
decanter with every mark of respect.]
CLARET said he had drunk in every word that had been dropped, and
thought no respectable wine ought any longer to bottle up his wrath at
the indignities he was exposed to; but though somewhat corky and
inclined to pour forth his grievances, in humble imitation of the for-
bearance º their exhilarating Cheerman he should only say, as to
much of the Lafitte in circulation, that he felt disposed to laugh it to
scorn; and of the Médoc he met with in society, one word woul
express his opinion—mediocre. He must add that he had no connec-
tion with the fluid he saw ticketed at 1s. a bottle. (Sensation.) .
CHAMPAGNE, who could no #. be kept in, was up the instart
CLARET resumed his jug, and indulged in some sparkling allusions to
the common gooseberry and familiar rhubarb. He was followed by
MosellE .#. who both rose together, as they found it impossible
to be still any longer, but being slightly elevated the Cheerman put
them down. The bottles then broke up, and things took a convivial
turn.
Amongst the company we noticed WIN DE GRAVE (looking very
serious), Tokay (with an Imperial), BURGUNDY white, with rage,
which he could hardly gulp down, HERMITAGE in a retired corner,
MoUNTAIN hampered with TRNT, and CHABLIS, who protested against
the practice of servants calling him Shabby.
Several Greek, Hungarian and Sicilian wines were unable to obtain
admission.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VETERAN IN woodstock WORKHOUSE.
Y HERCULEs,
Nil admirari is no motto of
mine. I could only adopt
it by construing your friend
“Q. H. F.” in a very literal
sense., Could one admire
hothing, as girls and babies
laugh at nothing, that,
indeed, would be something
to make and keep one happy.
Nay, it is not easy to con-
ceive greater happiness than
that of being constantly in
a state of admiration with
nothing at all to admire.
This would be like a per-
petual enjoyment of all the
pleasures of the table with-
out turtle, or venison, or
tripe. It would correspond
to an everlasting state of
beer minus beer, and apart
from anything else like
Château d'Yquem. But man
cannot enjoy empty dishes.
Nonentity won't do for
mutton. As I want some-
thing to eat, so I want
“... w something to admire...
esteem the capability of 'admiring answerable to a good appetite.
Therefore, I systematically admire everything that I can. I am always
finding some fresh object of admiration, and what I now see chiefly to
admire is the condition of the British Army and Nº.#;" but
particularly, (with a letter I have recently read in the Times before
me), the self-sacrifice of the British soldier.
ven you, Sir, were once a baby; so was DR. Johnson. Well,
Mr. Punch, in early da .* of you were perhaps 9ecasionally ex-
asperated by nursemaids’ reciting, in the thought that they were
diverting yous certain doggerel amoebaeics beginning with–
“Who comes here?”
“A Grenadier.”
“What do you want?”
“A pot of beer.”
T. Experience, however, sometimes discovers a pertinence in the
idiotisms of the nursery which may afford delight. There is, Sir, now
a soldier in the Woodstock Union Workhouse, one, Joseph OLIVER
ose case appears to have been contemplated by the prophetic bar
that originally composed the lines above quoted, doubtless in a state of
clairvoyance. The Chaplain of that Union, who is also Master of the
Woodstock Grammar §. gives us, in the Times, a short speech,
of the sort which the military pauper, an old Waterloo man, is in the
habit of delivering to, those who sympathise with him under, the cir-
mstances in which he has been suffered, in his destitute old age, to
place himself by a grateful country. According to the reverend
gentleman :—
He º “I feel I am fast going down hill, but I could eat better and suffer less
pain if I could have something lighter to eat. I don't think I've eat an allowance
of cheese these three weeks. If I could but have half-a-pint of beer a day it would
be everything to me. I could do with that and my tº. and should be contented.
I hope I am as happy as anybody can be in a workhouse, but I rever knowed any:
body stop in as could got out. Oh, how glad should I be to have liberty once more "
. This old soldier, it is true, was not a grenadier in the limited mean-
ing of the word. He fought at Waterloo in the 95th Rifles, now the
Rifle Brigade. But a Rifleman, is, to all intents, and purposes, a
British Grenadier, as contemplated in the song which asserts the
incomparability of Conon, Lysander, and all the other valiant heroes
to that one, Nor does this veteran in the grey uniform demand a pot
of beer in the pot-house sense of the word. That, as you and I, and
MoRLEY, and SAM Pope, and LAwson know, is a quart. The British
Grenadier in the workhouse limits his request to a pot of beer in what
we will call the workhouse sense of the word. He asks for only half-
a-pint of beer a-day; a pot so named rhetorically, part for the whole, a
parochial pot, a union pot of beer. If the old man who in#. adven-
tured to pour out his blood, like water at Waterloo, could now get a
small measure of beer poured out for himself, “it would be everything
him.” He was ever a good soldier. At Waterloo he “followed LoRD
ILL up three times within pistol-shot of Boney's platform;” and
after the fight was over he saved two lives. He is now aged 74
years, the last six of which he has spent in the workhouse, an example
to its other inmates. After seven years' service, he had left the Army, and
remained in his native yillage, working in the Stonesfield slate-quarries
till he was nearly blind. e parish then allowed him out-door relief
to the amount of half-a-crown and a loaf a week; but, since this
Mr. Punch, i.
I other
allowance, however generous for the needy people of Woodstock, was
one “as I couldn't,” he said, “live honeston,” º: was obliged to enter
the institution wherein he now abides, sighing, “Oh, how glad I should
e to have liberty once more!” and ºil; craving half-a-pint of beer.
... Small beer indeed, Mr. Punch, ought not that country to think of
itself which permits its veterans to implore half-a-pint of swipes in vain?
But now, don't you admire, like me, the self-sacrifice performed by
the British soldier in entering the service of a country that will let him
want half-a-pint of beer in his old º Don't you, Sir, also admire
this treatment of British soldiers, and don't you unspeakably admire
the magnitude of our Army, which, notwithstanding such usage, is
kept up to a strength not less, perhaps, than one-fifth of the force that
would be necessary for any serious attempt to resist invasion? All
this is very admirable, certainly. Qf course, we cannot, for one
moment, entertain the fear that too hard trial of the self-sacrificing
spirit of our voluntary soldiers will one day end in the alternative of a
conscription, or no Army at all. re is one thing more, Mr. Punch,
that cannot but greatly excite your admiration, as * does mine. That is
the vast military expenditure of a nation so frugal that it cannot afford
an old soldier half-a-pint of beer. “For Heaven's sake a pot of your
smallest ale !”. How much longer shall Joseph Oliver be permitted
to remain ineffectually uttering that piteous entreaty of
CHRistoph ERO SLY P
GOOD AND SAFE WOMEN,
MR. PUNCH,
... I’ve no patience with the fuss that is being made by those
stupid papers about bribery. Of course, if a man really thi he
ought to vote on one side, and takes money to go and vote on the
he doesn't do what is quite right, unless he has claims upon him
that he ought to consider before everything; but how often is it the
case that he has any idea which is the right side and which is the wrong?
I’ll be bound to say not ninety-nine times in a hundred, nor so much,
scarcely ever. Nobody knows what a woman has to go through with
a large family, and for a man in that situation, unless he is very well
off, not to vote for whoever will pay the most, I think it positively
wicked. It’s a shame that women have no votes. , Why not Woman-
hood Suffrage as well as Manhood Suffrage I know what I would
do with a suffrage I could get a hundred and fifty pounds by, or eventen.
But whether women have votes or no there is one thing I know,
they could do much better than men, I mean managing the bribery,
which I am sure there is no wrong in, or why do men laugh and joke
about it, if they think it serious? ...I have heard them of a great
briber years ago—I mean the briber lived many years ago—whose
name was FRAIL. Who was it said “frailty thy name is woman”?
meaning to be satirical, but I’m confident any woman, would be
much better than FRAIL at electioneering. We should be able to
coax the voters in a way men can't, and get their votes at a much
more reasonable rate, which would be a great save. What was that
story of the butcher, 1 think, who let the beautiful Duchess of
Whereabouts have his vote in favour of her candidate for a kiss P
Only if the butcher's wife had known, she would have taken care that
her husband shouldn’t have been such a fool.
And besides, the women could do all the bribery among themselves,
and that would prevent the money being spent at the public-house
instead of in new dresses for the children, and § the bills which
run up in no time to a º which is perfectly dreadful, and I’m sure
it's always best to pay all the tradesmen as soon as you can, or else
they put down all sorts of things you never had, and as to giving
evidence before Commissions like Great Yarmouth, I should, like to
see how much they would get out of one who would only just like to be
THE Wom AN IN THE Moon.
P.S. It’s the best plan always to send the money to the voter's wife,
like the four sovereigns at Reigate done up in the starch.

FEMININE SUPREMACY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, --
BEING a lady, I of course but very seldom read the news-
apers. Politics and such stuff are all very W.ſ. men, but there is little
in a paper that is interesting to women, except perhaps the murders an
the fashions, and the breach of promise cases. The other day, however,
I chanced to see a letter in the Pall Mall Gazette, written by a lady
upon quite a lady's subject, namely that of the employment of a
charitable sisterhood for “such works as hospital nursing, teaching in
schools, and yisiting the poor.”
Having a husband to manage, as well as five small children, I have,
Qu may imagine, as much work as I can do, and have scarce a moment's
eisure for visiting rich Pººl. even, and naturally none at all for
j.". poor. But I thoroughly agree with the writer of the
letter that yery much good may be done by a charitable sisterhood; and
though, being a true Britoness, I think that nothing, except, bonnets,
should be copied from the Continent, I quite admit with her that
foreigners might give us a few vastly useful hints upon this interesting
work. But I do not at all agree j. her in stating as an axiom that—
“Every woman wishes for a beaten and familiar path to walk in. Whether
ſº or wrongly, the most highly educated women are generally the most ready
to feel and urge the impropriety of any unneces singularity, or anything like a
disregard of public opinion, or even of custom, in their own sex.”
“ Unnecessary singularity” I abominate most heartily, as I have
often told my husband when scolding him because he meanly will persist
in keeping for my use a merely one-horse vehicle, while nearly all my
friends are accustomed to a pair. But I deny that “every woman
wishes for a beaten path to walk in,” for I am very sure that most of
us now much prefer to ride. , Nor do I admit that women always feel
inclined to comply with public custom. For instance, it is customary
for a wife to make a promise that she will obey her husband, but I see
no “impropriety” in her not keeping her word. And this leads me
to another foolish statement in the letter, which I utterly dispute—
“Every woman likes to be ruled, and prefers that her ruler should not be of her
own sex."
“Likes to be ruled ” indeed! What stuff and nonsense, to be sure!
I have no patience with the woman—if it really be a woman, which
I’m half inclined to doubt. It’s just the style of language that men
very often use, when, cowards that they are, they try to . a Woman
fancy she was born—poor thing !—with braisinferior to their own.
d|Before I married him, my husband, sometimes talked in this way about
the “weaker” sex. But I soon showed him that some women were
quite as strong as men, and indeed a little stronger, both in mind and
body too. The precious “lords of the creation,” as they delight to
call themselves, often find out that they have to give in to the ladies.
“Like to be ruled,” do we? Well, if this really be the rule, there are
plenty of erceptions to it, and among them you may reckon,
Sir, your very humble Servant,
GRIFFINA GREYMARE, née PRANCER.
P.S. Pray does Mrs. Judy like being ruled by you?" If so, poor
thing, I pity her

A GOOD OLD ATROCITY.
Not long ago a man, suspected of murder, committed suicide. A
coroner's jury returned him fºlo de se. With reference to this case, the
Times states that “a memorial is about to be presented to the Crown
that the claims to the property of the deceased may be waived by HER
MAJESTY for the benefit of the children.” . Of course the claims of
HER MAJESTY will be waived. But how is it that the law which
punishes the widows and orphans of suicides for a crime committed
principally against themselves, has been allowed to survive the laws
that burned witches and disembowelled traitors alive? The present
punishment of wilful suicide is no less barbarous than that which was
appointed for treason and witchcraft, and much more unreasonable;
for the persons who were burnt or eviscerated were the witches an
traitors, and not their relations. When the law in regard to self-murder
was altered, the Legislature did away with the least absurd and least
brutal part of it,only. They abolished the burial in cross-roads, and
transfixion with a stake, of senseless corpses, and they retained the
infliction of beggary on innocent survivors.
THE SCHOOLMISTRESS ABROAD.
What slipslop ladies, “educated” ladies even, write! See, here is
a queer specimen:—
RIGHTON.—A lady of education, having a luxurious HOME (for
the first time) is desirous of meeting with an elderl gentleman and his wife,
or two ladies to join the family table (if slightly ...}not objected to).
... For whom, we wonder, does this lady intend the covert taunt that
it is “for the first time” that her home is now luxurious?. And what
advantage can there be to her in mentioning the fact? Of course she
cannot mean to say it is her table which is “slightly invalided;” but
after having boasted about her education, she might as well have taken
the pains to write correctly the half-score words of English her adver-
tisement required. |
A CULINARY QUESTION.
My DEAR MR. PUNCH, . -
IUNDERSTAND there is nothing you don't know, from comets
to cookery. Will you help me in a little difficulty? I am sure you
will. BERNARD and I have not been long married—indeed, we have only
just returned from our wedding tour—and I am most anxious, to have
everything very nice for him for breakfast before he goes to the office.
Now, I hear there is a book called A Century of Potting, and I want to
know whether it tells you how meat, and game, and fish have been
potted for the last hundred years, or only gives a hundred receipts for
doing veal, and grouse, and lobster, and other good things, like, the
books that instruct you how to cook eggs, or apples, or rabbits in three
hundred and sixty-five different ways f -
Tell me this, and I will have anything potted for you that you like
to choose, from peacock to partridge, from salmon to shrimps, and sent
to your address, carriage paid. Ever yours, BERTHA.
[Mr. Punch would have been delighted to answer this note, and
receive the promised dainties, but unfortunately BERTHA, accustomed
he supposes, to sign her letters to BERNARD as above, has forgotten to
give either her surname or address. Mr. Punch, therefore, an onl
recommend her to look carefully into the works of the learned Pottek.
- -
A SMILE FOR THE SERIOUS.
REspecting a deceased clergyman, who was a leader of the Ritualists,
the Church and State Review says:-
“It is intended that his friends—and they are legion-shall pay their tribute to
his memory by completing the work which he loved best."
Very good; but what a name is Legion for the friends of any Clergy-
man to give themselves and each other | Legion, as the Chuºh and State
Review, knows, is a noun of multitude, signifying many. , Many what?
Has our Ritualistic contemporary never considered who they were
whose mouthpiece, on a certain occasion, named them Legion?, The
adoption of that word by a party of High Churchmen will no doubt be
what is vulgarly called nuts for the opposite party.

cRETâ NoTANDA.
RETE, it is reported, has re-
cently been the scene of an
action between Greeks and
Turks, in which 40,000 are
said to have been engaged on
either side. The probability
is, that not 10,000 arm
Greeks could be collected in
the island. This sort of canard
shows that one element at
least of the old reputation
of the island, as expressed
in a famous verse" of a
Cretan poet has not yet dis-
appeared.
: ... Crete was famous in old
times for three things, a great
law-giver (Minos), an intri;
cate labyrinth, and the skill
of its inhabitants with the
long-bow.
The labyrinth may still be
found—in Hellenico-Cretan
olitics: the skill with the
ong-bow, has been equally
ºf lived, and is being laid
under vigorous contribution
in the recent communications
from the island; as for the
famous law-giver, if he sur-
wives, like the other features
of old Cretan celebrit , —
for mercy’s sake let Crete
be annexed to Hellas, and her
law-giver be established en
permanence in Athens.

BUTTS IN THE BACK SETTLEMENTS.
THERE are butts upon Wimbledon Common,
here riflemen practice pursue;
That of neighbouring Sheen there are some on:
There are butts upon Wormholt Scrubbs too.
Such butts, in most suitable spaces,
Are stationed all over the land
And those butts are injust the right places:
Where they are it is well they should stand.
There are butts among men, who, by folly,
Themselves make the targets of wit:
Thºse butts yield good sport; they are jolly:
They never feel when they are hit.
And some butts are butts but from the weakness
Which obliges them insult to bear;
They are schooled in the virtue of meekness
By the bullies to snub them who dare.
There are other butts holding the water,
Reserved for some people to drink;
Stuff that qualifies thousands for slaughter
Who victims to pestilence sink.
In crowded and close habitations,
The homes of the labouring poor,
Absorbing all foul emanations
The buftstands behind the back door.
Its contents, at the best, filtered sewage,
Such drink as the Thames or the Lea,
Have worked into a horrible brewage,
That teems with things wondrous to see.
Confervae replete with 'tis render
And fungus-like growths, in brief time,
Infusoria, and insects, engendered
Amid rotten wood, rank ooze, and slime.
What a mixture for Christians to swallow!
These butts, though they targets are not,
Might breed, for the shaft of Apollo,
Such a mark as the Python he shot.
O Wººl rulers, remove them,
To some monster before they give birth!
O ye vestries and guardians, improve them,
At once, off the face of the earth!
HAPPY THOUGHTS.
(In the intermediate state between BooDELs' and FRASER's.)
At the London Terminus-Chopford is the station for Furze Lodge
or Cottage, or Furze Heath Lodge or Cottage. I’ve lost the address,
but recollect that whatever else it is or isn't, it’s certainly Furze some-
thing or other.
... Happy Thought.--To buy a little book for addresses only, and kee
it in my pocket. Or have a pocket made for it. That reminds me
was going to have aspecial pocket made for railway tickets. -
º to be labelled “Chopford” immediately. Porter says it’s
no good labelling it immediately, as the train doesn't go for two hours.
It appears that only the very slowest trains, which have nothin
better to do, stop at Chopford. But I say, “ There’s one at twelve.
“Was one at twelve,” he corrects me, adding, that “if he’d a known as
I was going by the Chopford train when I was talking to the cabman,
he’d a told me as there warn’t time to spare.”. It was trying; that
confounded repartee lost me the train. A policeman says, affably,
“Late, sir! Yery unfortunate, sir. There’s a nice refreshment-room
for waitin’in, Sir,” and he offers to conduct methither. I know what
he means. He wants a glass of beer. I hate such sycophancy. I reply,
sternly, “No, I don’t want the infernal refreshment-room. I want the
train.” A Hansom cabman º fellows those Hansom cabmen
because they’re so high up), says, jocosely, “Have a ride, Sir it ii
cool your temper.” I should like to have had something ready for
that. That’s what I want—ready wit...I must get some ready. Goo
* by the way, for a chapter in Typical Develºpments, Boºk VI,
Wol. iii. Ch. X., º I, when I come to it; heading, “Ready Wit.
Its Origin. In Use among the Ancients. Eramples in Animal, Kevetable,
and Mineral Life.”
Happy Thought.-Might compile a small Handbook of Repartees for
Tć. #. make a most useful pocket companion, with mar-
ginal references to Typical Developments. . -
Happy Thought—I’ll have plenty of marginal references in my boºk.
I like them. I’ll arrange this Handbook of Repartets alphabetically.
Thus, A: What comes under A* Armourer. Well, there you are,
repartee for an armourer. Also (so as to be quite fair), repartee to be
said to an armourer. B. What’s B? Baker. Butcher. partee for

baker or to baker; ditto for butcher or to butcher. C stands for Cook.
Capital little manual for cooks and housekeepers in conversation with
tradesmen. There might be permutations and combinations with
bakers and butchers and cooks. This opens up a large subject. Will
try a little book specially for notes on repartees; to put in my pocket.
ºil have a pocket made on purpose for it; also for railway tickets,
and addresses. - -
Nearly two hours to wait at the Terminus. My life seems to be cast
among railway officials. Dull work waiting.: noman with a note-book
can be dull: I am, though. I might as well have remained at Boodels
as waste my time here "Perhaps, if I had stopped, he’d have ††

Never stop too long at a friend's, or they won't regret your leaving.
I dare say Boodels misses me. Don't know, though; dare say he
doesn't. I think he'd miss me if it wasn't for MILBurd: MILBuko's
an ass. Time goes very slowly at a station. -
Happy Thought on seeing the Bookstall.--One can pickup a great deal
of knowledge from desultory reading. Take out the last new books as
if you were going to buy them; read a page here and there. You can
get an idea of most of them in ten minutes; at least, enough for
ordinary conversation. For instanº, when MRs. FRAsen, who reads
everything (well-informed woman, MRs. FRASER), says to me have
you read Îºlºr Holt?” I am able to reply, Well, I've not had time
to go right through it,” having, in point of fact, read, not more than
three pages in the first volume, in consequence of the stall-keeper's
becoming rather annoyed at my taking down ten books one after
d another without buying. Ishan’t tell Mrs. Fraser this. Some one
at dinner will suppose that “Of course, you...ye, read SIR SAMUEL
BAKER's book,” and I am enabled to º: “Well, um, not all of it,”
as if I’d only got one chapter more to finish. This is an age of º
literature, Mé. perhaps, the cheapest form of acquiring superii
knowledge. Go and see a train off. They won'tlet me ºn to the platform,
without a ticket.* * * Been doing nothing for the last quarter of an
hour. Go and see a train come in : might pickup character...Can't:
too much noise. Back to bookstall. Man objects, to my taking, any
more volumes down, and suggests his terms of subscription. I have
not pacified him by the purchase of a penny paper. Dull work even
with a note-book. .
Happy Thought.-I don't know much about locomotives. Will go

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ARTEMUS WARD IN LONDON.
MR. Punch, MY DEAR SIR, -
. I’ve been lingerin by the Tomb of the lamentid SHAKSPEARE.
It is a success.
I do not hes’tate to pronounce it as such. -
You may make any use of this opinion that you see fit. If you think
#: pºtion will subswerve the cause of litteratoor, you may pub-
Cate lit.
. I told my wife Betsy, when, I left home that I should go to the
birthplace of the orthur of Otheller and other Plays. She said that as
long as I kept out of Newgate she didn't care where I went. “But,”
I said, “don’t you know he was the greatest Poit that ever lived
Not one of these common poits, like that young idyit who writes verses
to our daughter, about the Roses as growses, and the Breezes as
blowses—but a Boss Poit—also a philosopher, also a man who knew a
great deal about everything.”
She was packing my things at the time, and the only answer she
; was to ask me if I was goin to carry both of my red flannel
illgilt, Caos.
Yes, ſºve been to Stratford onto the Avon, the birthplace of
SHAkspeARE, MR. S. is now no more. He’s been dead over three
hundred (300) years; . The peple of his native town are justly proud of
him. They cherish his mem'ry, and them as sell picturs of his birth-
place, &c., make it proftible cherishin it. Almost everybody buys a
pictur to put into their Albiom.
As I stood gazing on the spot where SHARSPEARE is s'posed to have
fell down on the ice and hurt hisself when a boy, (this spot cannot be
bought—the town authorities say it shall never be taken from Stratford)
I wondered if three hundred years hence picturs of my birthplace will
be in demand * Will the peple of my native town be proud of me in
three hundred years? I guess they won't short of that time, because
they say the fat man weighin 1000 pounds which I exhibited there was
stuffed out with
in July, “Oh bother, I can't stand this,” and commenced pullin the
pillers out from under his weskit, and heavin 'em at the audience. I
never saw a man lose flesh so fast in my life. The audience said I was
a * man to come chiselin my own townsmen in that way. I said,
“Do not be angry, ſeller-citizens. I exhibited him simply as a work
of art., I simply wished to show you that a man could grow fat without
the aid of cod-liver oil.” But they wouldn't listen to me... They are a
ow and grovelin set of peple, who excite a feelin of loathin in every
brest where lorfty emotions and original idees have a bidin place.
I stopped at Leamington a few minits on my way to Stratford onto
the Avon, and a very beautiful town it is. I went into a shoe º to
make a purchis, and as I entered I saw over the door those dear
familiar words, “By Appintment: H.R.H.;” and I said to the man,
“Squire, excuse me, but this is too much. I have seen in London
four hundred boot and shoe shops by Appintment: H.R.H.; and now
gou're at it. It is simply onpossible that the Prince can wear 400
pairs of boots. “Don’t tell me,” I said, in a voice choked with
emotion—“Oh, do not tell me that you also make boots for him, Say
iºnº. that you mend a boot now and then for him; but do not
tell me that you make 'em reg’lar for him.” - -
The man smilt, and said I didn't understand these things. He said
I perhaps had not noticed in London that dealers in all sorts of articles
was By Appintment. I said, “Oh, hadn't I? Then a sudden thought
flash ove: me.” I have it !” I said. “When the Prince walks
through a street, he no doubt looks at the shop windows.”
The man said, “No doubt.”
“And the enterprisin tradesman,” I continnerd, “the moment the
Prince gets out of sight, rushes frantically, and has a tin sign painted,
By Appintment, H.R.H. ! It is a beautiful, a great idee l’”
I then bought a pair of shoe strings, and wringin the shopman's
honest hand, fºstarted for the Tomb of SHARspeARE in a hired fly. It
lookt, however, more like a spider.
“And this,” I said, as I stood in the old º at Stratford,
beside a tomb-stone, “this marks the spot where lies WILLIAM W.
SHAKSPEARE. Alars! and this is the spot where—”
“You’ve got the wrong grave,” said a man—a worthy villager:
“SHAKSPEARE is buried inside the church.”
“Qh,” I said, “a boy told me this was it.” The boy larfed and put
the shillin I’d given him into his left eye in a inglorious manner, and
commenced movin backwards towards the street.
I pursood and captered him, and after talkin to him a spell in a
skarcastic stile, I let him went.
The old church was damp and chill. It was rainin. The only persons
there when I entered was a fine bluff old gentleman, who was talkin in
a excited manner to a fashmibly dressed young man. “No, ERNEST
MontREssex,” the old gentleman said, “it is idle to pursoo this
subjeck no further. You can never marry my daughter. You were seen
last Monday in Piccadilly without a umbreller I said then, as I say

tion. I sort of inferred that he wasn't inclined to listen to me, and so
I went on. But he was right about the umbreller. I’m really delighted
with this grand old country, Mr. Punch, but you must admit that it
does rain rather numerously here. Whether this is owing to a
monerkal form of gov'ment or not, I leave all candid and onprejudiced
persons to say.
WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE was born in Stratford in 1564. All the com-
mentaters, Shaksperian scholars, etsetry, are agreed on this, which is
about the only thing they are agreed on in regard to him, except that
his mantle hasn't fallen onto any poet or dramatist hard enough to
hurt said poet or dramatist much. And there is no doubt if these com-
mentaters and persons continner investigatin SHAKSPEARE's career, we
shall not, in doo time, know anything about it at all. When a mere
ind little WiLLIAM attended the Grammer School, because, as he said,
the Grammer School wouldn't attend him. This remarkable remark,
comin from one so young and inexperunced, set peple to thinkin
there might be somethin in this lad. He subsequently wrote Hamlet
and George Barnwell. . When his kind teacher went to London to
accept a position in the offices of the Metropolitan. Railway, little
WILLIAM was chosen by his fellow pupils to deliver a farewe
address. “Go on, Sir,” he said, “in a glorus career. Be like, a
eagle, and soar, and the soarer you get the more we shall all be
gratified That's so.”
M. young readers, who wish to know about SHAKSPEARE, better
get these vallyable remarks framed. -
I returned to the hotel. Meetin a young married couple, they asked
me if I could direct them to the hotel which WASHINGTON IRVING
used to keep? -
“I’ve understood that he was onsuccessful as a lanlord,” said the
ady.
ºwe 've understood,” said the young man, “that he busted up.”
I told 'em I was a stranger, and hurried away. They were from my
country, and ondoubtedly represented a thrifty Ile well somewhere in
Pennsylvany. It’s a common thing, by the way, for a old farmer in
Pennsylvany to wake up some mornin and find iſe's uirtin, all around
his back yard. He sells out for 'normous price, and his children F.
on gorgeous harness and start on a tower to astonish, peple. , They
succeed in doin it. Meantime the Île it squirts and squirts, and Time
rolls on. Let it roll. - - - - -
A very nice old town is Stratford, and a capital inn is the Red
Horse. Every admirer of the great S. must go there once certinly;
and to say one isn't a admirer of him, is equv'lent to sayin one has jest
about brains enough to become a efficient tinker.1.
Some kind person has sent me CHAwcER's Poems. MR. C. had

INFORMATION FOR THE CRIMINAL CLASSES.
ThERE has appeared a little narrative in the Daily Telegraph which concerns the
dangerous classes. It is to the effect that a riot, nearly occurred the other day at
Chatham Convict Prison, in consequence of the change lately made in the quantity
and nature of the food supplied to the criminals confined there. Qne Sunday,
as soon as dinner was served, several of those, rascals began to behave in a
mutinous, manner. Before their example, could be followed by the rest of the
villains, they were romptly seized, ironed, and hurried off to the solitary cells.
Finally, twelve of them “underwent corporal punishment,” and will be reduced
to a lower class, in which they will be curtailed of all the “privileges” which
they had “enjoyed” before.
t is desirable that thieves and ruffians should be let know that if they get into
aol, they will there be restricted to diet which is unsatisfactory in quantity and
istasteful º: that, should they dare to murmur at their coarse and low
diet, they will be soundly flogged, and that, after having “undergone corporal
punishment” they will be reduced to a state more uncomfortable than that which
the Pºiº “enjoyed”—in the sense in which invalids are said to “enjoy ill
health.” They will be deprived of even all the enjoyment compatible with hard
labour and hard fare. The paragraph whence the foregoing particulars are derived
should be reprinted for gratuitous distribution by the police, and it should be posted
about in all places where it is likely to meet the eyes of the rascalry. For the especial
benefit of the “R.,& W. Imp.” class, the text should be accompanied with an illus.
tration, which would render it the more ºdifying—a woodcut representing the convict
mutineers “undergoing corporal punishment.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LOVER'S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
He world once upon a
time was indebte
to Mr. Punch for his
Complete, . Letter-
writer, which, it is
needless to remind
that world, has ever
since been its manual
for epistolary, com-
pilation. . Therein
the Merchant, the
Bishop, the States-
man, the Shop-
keeper, the Lover,
could find a guide
and afamiliar friend.
There were samples
--- of all sorts, colours,
and sizes, fitting every hand better than the finest Parisian kid. In such
a volume, of course, particular attention could not be given to the
various individual cases included under any one head, therefore the
appearance of a small red-coveredibook entitled The Lover's Corre-
, has not in anyway taken Mr. Punch by surprise. On the con-
trary he has long º: such a production, and it has come atlast.
Much, however, as this little work has achieved, it yet falls short of
being a Complete Lover's Manual “in all matters relating to Court-
ship and Matrimony.” - -
it is an Incomplete Letter Writer, complementary suggestions
which Mr. Punch, by the hands of his ready writer, intends to throw
in, can only be appreciated after a careful perusal of the yolume in
question. With this slight, but necessary, preface Mr. Punch will now
offer to the letter-writing public, a few elegant specimens of such, a
style as will, if happily imitated by even the verydullestlovers, speedily
lead to a termination eminently satisfactory to all parties concerned.
LETTER. I.-From a Gentleman to a Lady he has only seen once, when he
was mounting to the knife-board ºf a Brompton omnibus,
Madam or Miss, - 19, Bucklersbury Walk.
The first º that you caught of me, the other day must
have been when I was half way up on my road to the top of the public
conveyance, which had the inexpressible º of carrying you as far
as it is legally allowed, “all the way,” for the small sum of one-third
of a shilling; that is, Madam or Miss, you would have seen me, or
part of me, if you had then cast your sparkling glances in the direc-
tion of my boots, which I now remember, with regret, were more or
less sprinkled with the murky mud, for which the streets of our
metropolis are so famous. -
But, Madam, or Miss, I had seen you gº and, in one second, the tele-
scopic dart of Čupid the God of Love had pierced through to my hearſ.
Feeble must necessarily be any description of the sudden shock, which,
together with that occasioned by the onward movement of the vehicle,
caused me to fall forwards and clutch with the desperation of a drown-
ing man at the º umbrellas of my fellow-passengers. Did you
not, Madame, or Miss, feel a sympathy with me during the journey:
I sat above you, having selected a seat just over the spot where I
knew your beautiful head was. Yes, Madam, or Miss, there was, as
the Poet has observed- ---

impulse, I ascertained your name from the Postman, who, a few
moments after your arrival at your own portals, which were shut in my

SHOCKING BRUTALITY. ºn
MR. Punch,
... ... SoMEBody, I believe, has lately thought fit to publish a com-
pilation of the sayings of celebrated authors in the praise and dispraise
of “lovely woman.” I have not seen that work. I do not wish to
see it, but all well-regulated female minds will agree with me when I
venture to assert that it contains nothing so atrocious as what I am
about to introduce to you. ... . . .
In a report of the proceedings of the Commission, sitting to inquire
into the purity, or otherwise, of the Electors of the Borough of Totnes,
one of the Commissioners was a MR. BERE, and he was examining a
witness called CHAPPLE:-
*MR, BERE. Did you tellany human being about your coming here to-day?
“WITNEss. Human being? No, Sir.”
Should not MR. BERE have been satisfied? I say, emphatically,
Yes. But he fiendishly proceeds:–
“Mr. BERE. Did you not tell your wife?
“Witness. Yes, Sir.”
Let us hope, Mr. Punch, for the sake of that unhappy witness, that
MRs. Q. is not a highly-developed strong-minded female, but that she
is small in stature, and of an angelic temperament.
You may, or may not, just as you please, consider me a misogynist,
but I have much pleasure in subscribing myself, A BACHELOR.

A DEBATE OF THE FUTURE.
IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT. Monday, June 21, 1876.
THE House met at four o'clock. It being the Hebrew Chaplain's
turn to read prayers, that ceremony was performed by the REv. DR.
ABLER, whose magnificent intonation excited much admiration.
Petitions being no º resented since the Manufacture of those
articles was suppressed, the SPEAKER, the Right HoN. S. H. WALPole,
who had been unanimously elected for his great, knowledge of Parlia-
mentary practice and for his affable and jºi. manners, called for
*Sº which Members desired to put.
answer to LoRD STANLEY, SIR, John BRIGHT said that he was
furnishing the British º as rapidly as possible with the new, fulmi-
nating powder, and as War Minister he was glad to say that he
believed the novel invention would be most destructive, though, of
course, as a Member of the Cabinet, he trusted the war would be
avoided.
. In answer to Lorp John MANNERs, SIR ERNEst Jones (the Soli-
citor-General) said that it was the intention of Government to prosecute
the persons who had held a riotous political meeting on Shakspeare
Hill (late Primrose Hill) and had º: the oak. He regretted that
Conservatives should so misconduct themselves, but they must be
taught to respect the law. (Cheers.)
In answer to, MR, WHALLEY, SIR GoLDw1N SMITH (the Home
§§ said that the endowment of the Roman Catholic priesthood
in Ireland was working exceedingly well, and that Her Majesty's
Government was not inclined to disturb existing arrangements.
On the orders of the day being taken, -
LoRD CRANBoRNE moved the Second Reading of the Bill for giving
votes to Paupers in Workhouses. -
MR. ODGERs moved that the Bill be read a second time that day six
months. He condemned the revolutionary conduct of the Tory party.
The franchise had been made quite extensive enough by the Reform
Act of 1867, and he should oppose any endeavour to give political
power to those who were notoriously unfit for its exercise. To have
A SHOOTING QUEEN.
The Post lately contained the announcement following:
“The KING and QUEEN of DENMARK are expected to arrive at
Marlborough House in the course of the ensuing week, from Den-
mark. Their Majesties will remain a fortnight in London, after
which they go to Sandringham for pheasant shooting.”
What, both of them? So it seems that the QUEEN of
DENMARK is a sportswoman. As such we hope that she
will set an example in pheasant shooting; go out and kill
pheasants fairly, and give no countenance to slaughtering
them in a battue.
LAY OF A LOAFER.
I wish I were a King
But one without a throne;
A heavy Crown is not the thing
... I wish to call my own.
'Tis not a reigning Rer
That I would wish to be :
I’d rather have prefixed an “ex”
Unto my Majesty.

Figures of Fact and Figures of Speech.
We don't know any Manchester Demonstration so con-
clusive as the Manchester Guardian's Demonstration that
the ground on which, the open-air, League Meeting was
held in that city, could not possibly have contained more
than 50,000 people, packed as close as human beings can
be packed, and that it did not, as a matter of fact, contain
half that number on that particular occasion. So, between
the Star's 130,000 and the Telegraph's 40,000, if we split the
difference, we shall still be enormously above the mark in
gauging the Manchester assemblage by the League's sole

man from using a vote rightly.
GENERAL #: said #. the honourable Member talked cussed
nonsense. (Order, order.) Well, he withdrew the expression, and
would substitute’ unimaginable bosh. Many persons had become
paupers from no fault of their own, but from ſhe working of a system
which they desired to be able to, alter. The Honourable $fémber had
no sense of religion, or he would not speak in that way of the poor.
Many of them were very jolly chaps, - ---
Mr. BEALEs said that this might be so, but #". was not, per se,
a qualification for electoral rights. Gravity and sobriety were bºttºr
claims. The course of the so-called Conservative party reflected little
credit upon them, and they would not be, allowed to overthrow our
venerated institutions. LoRD DisrAELI had said in the House of
Lords (Order, order)——in another place, that we were “drifting into
oligarchy.” it was perfectly untrue, but oligarchy was better than
anarchy, and he for one would be no Anacharsis. -
Loni, John MANNERs said that when the PREMIER was simply LoRD
AMºrley he had used very different language from that of his present
subordinates and supporters, but ever since he had taken.his sea!
beside his venerable father, as a peer of the realm, he had hidden, all
true liberality in his gilded coronet. Even EARL, GLADstone had
more advanced views, and he wished that nºble Earl were in the
Čabinet, instead of confusing himself with translating CQNFUCIUs.
Mr. Bugg deprecated personalities, which he observed always came
from the aristocracy. EARL GLADStone had done enough when, as
Governor-General of India, he had re-arranged the finances of, that
Empire in such a way as to \make India prosperous, and provide for
the 'speedy extinction of the National debt, which was now incon-
siderable. -
GENERAL BrownLow KNox said he did not care much about this
Bill, but as an old and veteran soldier he would ask, the Secretary for
War why he refused votes to Chelsea and Greenwich pensioners.
Sirjöhn Bright replied that he wished the honourable and gallant
Member would talk only of what he understood, though at the cost of

Army—and he would add, the Navy, taking leave to . what his
honourable friend the First Lord, (Ma. Roebuck,), would say much
better, were among the noblest of professions, but fighting had
nothing to do with voting. Besides, a pension compelled its holder to
support the system that gave it, and therefore he had gladly carried the

revolutionary character, and the object of its promoters was to set class
against class. He had an awful good mind to ascertain whether they
could not be prosecuted for sedition. (Hear, hear.) -
SIR John TRollope said that his brother Baronet was a little hard

intentions which they had always conceded to him. (Cheers.) Why
should not a pauper have a vote?, Did bribery exist, he admitted that
there might be danger, but bribery ..º." made impossible

and unless they were prepared to supply the workhouses with the
seventy-two morning and ninety-five evening daily papers, an expense
which his friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (MR. Lowe) might
not view º he could not sanction the measure, even were it
genuine, instead of a manifestation of Tory spite against our Consti-
tution.
EARL GRosvenoR was no enemy to the Constitution, and indeed
walked up Constitution, Hill every day of his life. (Ironical cheers.)
He had no doubt that allusions to the Park were distasteful to many
Honourable Members, and he was glad that thiſ had the grace to be
ashamed of certain passages in their history. He should support the
Bill, as poverty was no crime. ---
R. MILL begged to protest against the last proposition of the noble
Lord. To profess compassion for poverty was needless, all good men
had that, but poverty represented criminality somewhere, as logic
would show the noble Lord. Would it not be better to wait until
º, should be extirpated, as there was every reasonable hope it
would be after a few years’ working of the Self-Maintenance Act?
SIR DARBY GRIFFITH ... that poverty would never be extir-
pated. What would benevolent people have to do, especially females,
if their pauper º whom he º say they preserved, like
heasants, were taken away? He hated this new-fangled flying in the
ace of nature, and considered that paupers, if kept in their places,
were highly conducive to the benefit of society, as affording a field for
the exercise of º and º:
SIR ERNEST Jones had yet to learn that we had a right to keep

ill it was a bit of popularity hunting and clap-trap, if not of the
§ character ascribed to it by his honourable friend the Minister
Or War.
IoRD CRANBoRNE would not occupy the House long with a º:
and he would avoid the personalities in which Ministers and their
friends had indulged so disgracefully. The Cabinet was tyrannical and
its friends were insolent. Of this he did not complain, for he ex:
pected nothing better. But he did complain that efforts in favour of
the helpless and the oppressed were slandered as this had been, and he
hoped that at the coming elections the people would notice who had
sought to extend the franchise.
SIR John BRIGHT. We understand you—so will the people.

The Punch Testimonial Bill, the Abolition of Bells and Street-Organs

attraction of the drama.

and gas-lamps for street
scenes, and sometimes the

these realities attract, there
are surely other ways in
which the drama may be made more real, than it is. For in:
stance, real banquets, might be served upon the stage, and, instead
of venison pasties being made of paint , and pasteboard, they
might be manufactured with real meat and crust, Toasts might
be proposed and drunk in real bumpers, and not with empty goblets,
Ot a jº of coloured water which is made to pass for wine. For
rewards of honest service, or as bribery for crimes, real money might
be given and not bits of brass or metal counters jingling in a purse.
It would add, too, in some measure to the interest of a play, if certain
of the characters were really what they say they are. ere the actors
really wealthy who play the rich old uncles, or benevolent old fathers,
how very much more naturally they would perform the part!...Only
fancy, how the audience would warm up to them when saying, “There
take her, you young dog, and here’s a real cheque for you, upon a real
banker, and you may really get it cashed . "
Being an actor myself, and not having * money, I am competent
to feel how very difficult it is to personate the character of a man of
handsome property, in which, however, I feel certain I should make a

fancy, to settle an estate, or a comfortable income, on some member of
his company, who should be specially º ed to play the wealthy
parts. If you hear of any Manager who feels at all inclined to act
upon this notion, I shall be happy to act for him at a moderate weekly
wage. Of course, however, the estate must first be legally secured to
me, or else a good round sum invested for me in the funds. I feel
erfectly convinced that I should make a great success as a large

So much as there has been said lately about the Working Man
nobody says a word for the wife, and I’m sure she very often works
the harder of the two. I declare with me it’s work work work and

another I never get a moment's peace, there’s wash wash wash, and
mend mend mend, the children always tearing their things, never out
of mischief, and the cooking to attend to, and help clean the things
and make the beds, and lay the table-cloth and knives and forks, an

worse than they were before, and the house always in a mess and a
state of confusion, and then when one's husband comes home he
expects his dinner ready for him and grumbles if he has to wait only
half-an-hour and is cross because the potatoes are cold, and then there’s

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“KNOCK-OUTS,” TRADE AND PARLIAMENTARY.
HERE's been enough of auction-rooms,
their tricksters, touts and liars,
Their Jews and brokers leagued to
fleece poor bond-fide buyers;
How by mock bids 'gainst others
they “the green horn put the
cheat on,”
Till he pays five times the value for
the lot that he is sweet on.
And when at this nice little game
these rogues have had their in-
nings
We’ve heard how in a smug knock-
out they meet to square the win-
nings. -
Dividing losses, if there's loss, or
rofits, if there's profit,
Ti whichever way the sale has one,
they get their “reg’lars” of it.
So to bid or buy at auctions if hence-
forth you make bold, Sir,
'Tis with warning private buyers are
the one lot that is sold, Sir;
And if the bargain hunter with the
broker tries conclusions, .
'Tis a case of wilful ignorance, in an
age of disillusions.
But there’s another auction-mart
where craft and fudge and flam are
Seen in quite as ſº perfection as
in sales under the hammer,
Where bids are just as duffing, and brokers even bolder,
And bond fide customers more certain to be sold are.
And that's the auction mart maintained by our election-brokers,
Who to fresh-fledged ambitions of new men act as stokers:
At MR.NEwMAN's ear they buzz, M.P. before him dangle,
While for his purse with subtle bait and well-barbed hook they angle.
- 2
Some public cause, with honest will, Fº NEWMAN p . espouse;
They translate “pro bono publico” “for the good of public-houses.
Their man’s the man who'll “cut up well,” nor question of the slices,
That have melted down so quickly, in paying folks their prices.
Poor NewMAN steps into the mart; he’s set his heart a seat on :
No borough in particular, but any borough sweet on :
Legal expenses must be paid: he don't mean to be º
But of bribery and corruption he no more dreams than a babby!
The touts are busy round him: most respectable of visitors-
ocal grandees, trade magnates, and sharp-witted keen solicitors,
What’s wanted in the market is his purse and not his person,
Legal expenses only trust his brokers to disburse on.
And so they play their little game, the vote market is flourishing,.
Corruption's stream, like sewage, runs so foul and fat and nourishing:
The brokers bid, with tongue in cheek, the struggle most intense is:
And all the principals have got to do, is to pay expenses.
And when the contest's over and Buff has won the borough,
Blue's agents file #. and demand inquiry º: 3 ..
And Blue and Buff must pay again, for accusing and defending,
And there’s another bill run up, and so on without ending !
When the game's out, or Blue and Buff will not stand further bleeding,
The brokers meet, and pleasantly compound, or stay proceeding:
And at a snug “knockout” arrange their late (mis)understanding,
And square accounts, the difference one to the other handing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 145
ARTEMUS WARD IN LONDON.
MR. PUNCH, MY DEAR SIR, - -
It is seldim that the Commercial relations between Great
Britain and the United States is mar'd by Games, - - -
It is Commerce, after all, which will keep the two countries friendly
to'ards each other rather than statesmen. -
iſ look at your last Parliament, and I can't see that a single speech
was encored during the entire session.
Look at Congress—but no, I'd rather not look at Congress. . .
intertainin this great regard, for Commerce, “whose sales whiten
every sea,” as everybody º observes every chance, he gets; I
learn with disgust and surprise that a British subjeck bo't a Barril of
Apple Sass in America recently, and when he arrove home he found
§: a few deloosiv layers of sass nothin but saw-dust. ... I should
have instantly gone into the City and called a meetin of the leadin
commercial men to condem and repudiate, as a American, this, grºss
frawd, if I hadn't learned at the same time that the draft given by the
British subjeck in payment for this frawdylent sass was drawd onto a
Bankin House in London which doesn't have a existence, but far
otherwise, and never did. -
There is those who larf at these things, but to me they merit rebooks
and frowns.
With the exception of my UNCLE WILYIM-who, as I’ve before
stated, is a uncle by marrige only, who is a low cuss and filled his coat
º with pies and biled eggs at his weddin breakfast, given to him
y my father, and made the clergyman as united him a present of my
father's new overcoat, and when my father on, discoverin it got in a
rage and denounced him, UNCLE WILYIM said the old man (meanin
my º hadn't any idee of first-class Humer'—with the exception
of this wretched Uncle, the escutchin of my fam’ly has never been
stained by Games. The little harmless deceptions I resort to in my
perfeshion I do not call Games. They are sacrifisses to Art.
I come of a very clever fam’ly.
The WARDs is a very clever fam’ly, indeed.
I believe we are descendid from the Puritins, who nobly fled from a
land of despitism to a land of freedim, where they could not only enjoy
their own religion, but prevent everybod else from enjoyin his.
As I said before, we are a very clever ..
I was strollin up Regent Street, the other day, thinkin what a clever
fam’ly I come of, and looking at the gay shop-winders. I’ve got some
new close since you last saw me. I saw them others wouldn't do.
They carrid the observer too far back into the dim vister of the past;
and I gave 'em to a Qrſun Asylum. The close I wear now I bo't of
MR. Moses, in the Commercial Road. They was expressly made, MR.
Moses informed me, for a nobleman, but as they fitted him too muchly,
|...}. the trows'rs (which is blue, with large red and white checks)
e had said, “My dear feller, make me some more, only mind–be sure
you sell these to some genteel old feller.” " .
I like to saunter thro' Regent Street. The shops are º and it
does the old man's heart good to see the troops of fine hea thy girls
which one may always see there at certain hours in the afternoon, who
don’t º their beauty by devourin cakes and sugar things, as too
many of the American and French lasses do. It’s a mistake about
everybody being out of town, I guess. Regent Street is full. I'm
here; and, as iſsaid before, I come of a very clever fam’ly. -
As I was walkin along, amoosin myself by stickin my penknife into
the calves of the footmen who stood waitin by the swell-coaches (not
one of whom howled with angwish), I was accosted by a man of about
º summers, who said, ºf have seen that face somewheres
ore l’”
He was a little shabby in his wearin apparil. His coat was one of
those black, shiny garments, which you can always tell have been bur-
nished by adversity; but he was very gentlemanly.
“Was it in the Crimea, comrade * Yes, it was. It was at the
º: Sebastopol, where I had a narrow escape from death, that
we met !”
I said, “No, I wasn't at Sebastopol. I º: a fatal wound by
not bein there. It was a healthy old fortress,” I added.
“It was. But it fell. It came down with a crash.”
“And plucky boys they was who brought her down,” I added;
“and hurrah for 'em!” - -
The man graspt me warmly by the hand, and said he had been in
America, Upper Canada, Africa, Asia Minor, and other towns, and
he'd never met a man he liked as much as he did me. “Let us,” he
added, “let us to the shrine of Bachus !” And he dragged me into
a public house. I was determined to pay, so I said, *Mr. Bacăus,
give this gen’l’man what he calls for.” - -
We conversed there in a very pleasant manner till my dinner-time
arrowe, when the agree’ble gentſeman insisted that I should dine with
him. “We’ll have a banquet, Sir, fit for the gods!”
I told him good plain vittles would soot me. If the gods wanted to
have the dispepsy, they was welcome to it.
We had soop and fish, and a hot jint, and growsis, and wines of
rare and costly vintige. We had ices, and we had froots from Green.
land's icy mountins and Injy's coral strands; and when the sumptoous
reparst was over, the agree’ble man said he'd unfortnitly left his
ocket-book at home on the marble center-table. “But, by Jove'."
e said, “it was a feast fit for the gods !” -
I said, “Oh, never mind,” and drew out my puss ; tho’ I in'ardly
wished the gods, as the dinner was fit for 'em, was there to pay for it.
I come of a very clever fam’ly. -
The *...* gentleman then said, “Now, I will show you our Club.
It dates back to the time of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.'
. Did | belong to it?” I inquired.
e did.” -
“Wall,” I said, “if BILLY was one of 'em, I need no other endorse-
ment as to its respectfulness, and I'll go with you, my gay trooper
bº, ” And we went off arm-in-arm.
n the way the agree’ble man told me that the Club was called the
Sloshers. He said I would notice that none of 'em appeared in evenin
dress. He said it was agin the rools of the club. In fack, if an
member appeared there in evenin dress he’d be instantly sº
“And yit,” he added, “there's geneyus there, and lorfly emotions, and
intelleck. You’ll be surprised at the quantities of intelleck you’ll
sec there.”
We reached the Sloshers in due time, and I must say they was a
shaky-lookin lot, and the public house where they convened was cer.
timily none of the best.
The Sloshers crowded round me, and said I was welcome. “What
a beautiful brestpin you’ve got,” said one of 'em, Permit me,” and
he took it out of my neckercher. ... “Isn't it luvly,” he said, parsin it
to another, who parsed it to another. It was given me by my Aunt,
on my promisin her I’d never swear profanely; and I never have,
except on very special occasions, I see that beautiful boosum pin a
parsin from one Slosher to another, and I’m reminded of them sad
words of the poit, “parsin away.' parsin away!” I never saw it no
more. Then in comes a athletic female, who no sooner sees me than
she utters a wild yell, and cries:–
“At larst' at larst! My Wily!M, from the seas"
I said, “Not at all, Marm. , Not on no account. I have heard
the boatswain pipe to quarters—but a voice in my heart didn't whisper
SEU-zAN I've belayed the marlinspikes on the upper jibpoop, but
SEU. ZAN's eyes wasn't on me, much. Young woman, f am not you’re
Saler boy. Far different.”
“Oh yes, you are l’” she howled, seizin me round the neck. “Oh,
how I’ve lookt forwards to this meetin!” -
“And you’ll presently,” I said, “have a opportunity of lookin
backwards to it, because I'm on the pint of leavin this institution.”
I will here observe that I come of a very clever fam’ly. A very
clever family, indeed.
“Where.” I cried, as I struggled in vain to release myself from the
eccentric female's claws, “where is the Capting—the man who was
into the Crimea, amidst the cannon's thunder? I want him.”
He came forward, and cried, ...What, do I see ? Me. Sister! me
sweet ADULAIDE! and in teers! Willin!” he screamed, “and you’re
the serpent as I took to my boosum, and borrowed money of, and went
round with, and was cheerful with, are you?—You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.” -
Somehow my coat, was º off, the brest-pocket of which con-
tained my pocket-book, an it parsed away like the brestpin. Then
* Sorter º; hustled me into the street.
t was about 12 at night when I reached the Greenlion.
“Ha! haſ you sly old rascal, you’ve been up to larks!” said the
lan'lord, larfin loudly, and digging his fist into F; ribs.
I said, “Bigsby, if you do that º I shall hit you! Much as I
respect you and your excellent fam’ly, I shall disfigger your benever-
lent countenance for life'."
“What has ruffled yours irits, frend?” said the lan'lord.
“My spirits has been ruffled,” I ansered in a bittur, voice, “by a
viper who was into the Crimea. What was it,” I cried, “for
Sébastopol to fall down without enwelopin in its rooins that viper ?”
I then went to bed. I come of a very clever fam’ly.

It’s an out-of-the-way place, is Slumborough station. No one to
talk to. , Let me observe. There's a porter, who is always whistling ;
an impulsive station-master who won’t be stopped to be spoken to,
he’s so busy; a potatoe-garden, a small neat cottage, three broken
helpless looking trucks, the commencement of an unfinished line, with
the ends of its rails turning upwards towards the sky, as if that had
been their destination. I may note down as a

idea comes to be developed, Vol. IV., Book VIII, Chap. I., Typical
Developments, it will be very poetical. Qdd, how full of poetry I am to
#. This is the second poetical thought I’ve had within the last half
lour.
I ask the porter, in order to get at statistics, “How many trains pass
here in a day?” He stops his whistle, about four bars from the end of
the tune I should say, and answers, “If you look at the time-table,
it's all up there,” and then he starts a fresh tune. An express passes,
and I wonder if there’s any one I know in it. The porter takes another
turn at the truck, and then strolls into the potatoe-garden, and kicks
the potatoes. . this is the process of 5.ºf in this part of the
country. (“Agriculture,” Typical Developments, Vol. III., Book.VI.) I
should like to talk to the station-master. I go inside. Office shut up.
Behind the partition I hear the scratching of a pen, and rustling of paper.
He is then, probably, hard at work. While I am thinking this, the door
in the partition opens and he comes out briskly; I say to him, “Can
you tell me—” He replies impulsively, “Yes, there's the time-table,”
and goes out on to the platform....In a minute he, is back again, as
brisk as ever, l address him, “Will the train—” He replies, with
his hand on the brass knob of his door, “Office open five minutes
before train comes,” and disappears. More scratching of pen and
ſºlin; of paper within. There is a large, clock with an impressive
tick. I compare, my watch with it, and, though I arrive at no con-
clusion on the subject, feel satisfied at having done something.

The Train arrives.—Hurrah! For Chopford at last. Now, do the
FRASERs live at Furze Lodge or Cottage y
Chopford Station.—Get out. Official receives my ticket. Very nearly
getting into a difficulty with him, as I have tendered my Second class
ticket from Slumborough to Chopford, and he saw me get out of the
First class carriage. * * * What an agony it puts one in not to be
able to find the proper ticket. * * * Right at last. I’ve often said I
must have a regular pocket made for tickets, and so I must. Luggage
here. No name on it, but labelled Chopford. I am going to Furze
Lodge I tell him: because if it isn't Furze Lodge and is Furze Cottage
he’ll correct me. The official is most civil. “Furze Lodge, oh, of
course.” The FRASERs are evidently well known and highly respected.
“The carriage for Furze Lodge is waiting, Sir, to take you. Here’s
the footman.” He takes me | to a tail menial in a handsome livery
and a cockade. (I note that the FRASERs are going it.). The mºnial
touches his hat, on the station-master introducing me politely as “the
gentleman for Furze. A porter puts my luggage into the carriage,
and I put myself in after it. The coachman touches his hat on seeing
me, the footman bangs the door, the station-master salutes me, the
porter, interests himself in my welfare to inquire “if I’ve got every-
thing,” which simply means sixpence for himself. (Note for travelling.
Always carry threepenny bits.)
My spirits rise. Such a carriage. Damask lining: softest cushions.
I suppose FRASER is a Deputy-Lieutenant or something, or else why
jºi the servants wear cockades? It can’t be to impose upon the
country people. No, FRASER's above that. He is not a snob.
We enter Furze gates. Pretty little lodge at the gate. Qld woman
comes out and bobs a curtsey to me. Nice old woman. I bow to her
and smile. For a moment I imagine myself the Prince of Wales. . It
must be very tiring to go on bowing and smiling; but gratifying.
Deer in the park. Öld timber.
Happy Thought.—I must get up my sketching again, and practise
trees. Splendid oaks. Chestnuts. Cows. Two labourers: or peasants.
What's the difference between labourer and peasant? One's real, and
the other poetical. (Query this in Vol. IV., Typical Developments.)
They touch their hats respectfully to me. . I return, graciously. More
gates. What a delicious place FRASER has. Knowing him and his
wife only in town, where they take lodgings for a month in the season,
I had no idea he was so wealthy. (N.B. Never judge a man by his

FRASER, too, is such a nice person. All clever people here I'll be
bound, or they wouldn’t do this sort of thing; because there is origi-
mality about it. Delightful; simply ãº ! I think I see FRASER
and MRs. FRASER among the party. I wave º hand. I feel exhila-
rated. I shout, “How are you, how are you?”. Meaning FRASER,
who of course can't answer at that distance, but will take the inquiry
for what it’s meant. I like being hearty with people.
Here we are at the door of Furze Lodge. A grey-headed butler
descends, solemnly : he is like a clergyman, indeed for the matter of
that, an archbishop. Iivery opens #. carriage door. The archbishop
stands on the steps as if about to impart a benediction. I should like
to kneel to him.
Happy Thought—If I do get up my sketching, I’ll draw a picture of
Hospitality in the Olden Time. Arrival of Pilgrims at the Archbishop's.
More livery servants. FRASER must be very rich. (I have time to
make a note or two while, they are engaged with my luggage.) The
butler tells the servants “The Blue Room,” and I think of Fatima and
Baron Ahomelique. (N.B. Another subject for a sketch.), I see m
packages being carried up the grand old oaken staircase adorned wit
portraits of FRASER's ancestors, all with very white hands. This is just
the place I like. Beautiful!!! I address the butler for the first time,
having É'. my hat, coat and umbrella to a livery, who has di
appeared with them. In an offhand manner, in order to show that I
am accustomed to all this grandeur, and am quite one of the family, I
ask him, “Are they in P’” He replies, benignly, “I was to show you to
the study, Sir, directly you came.” answer, “Oh, very well,” and
then inquire, also in an offhand manner, “Who’s in the Croquet
ground P’’ The butler calmly replies, “There’s LoBD ADolphus,
Sir, and LADY ADELA, they only came down this morning; there’s
MR. AYLMER, CAPTAIN DOODLEY, Miss Ascutt, CoLONEL LYNE,
LADY TULKoRNE and Miss GREME, and the family, Sir His Grace
hasn't been able to go out, Sir, for three days.” I had no idea the FRASERs
did this sort of thing. What a letter iſ shall write to old BooDels
about the place. He'll be precious glad to get me back again to
Boodels, thinking I’ll introduce him to the FRASERs, But I won't:
or perhaps I will, and astonish him. That vulgar fellow, MILBURD,
wouldn't get on here. I note this while in a library,where the butler has
left me, while he prepares his master for my coming. From what the
butler says Ifancy poor Fraser has got the gout.” “The gout,” the
reverent domestic has casually observed, “does make, an invalid very
irritable.” He returns and motions me towards a door artfully con-,
cealed from view by sham bookshelves. I enter, prepared to say,
“Well, old boy, I'm . to see you like this,” when the butler an-
nounces me softly, so softly that I cannot hear what he, says, to the
invalid, who is in a large comfortable chair, swathed in flannels. The
room is partially darkened, and I see that noisy heartiness is out of the
question. -
I go up to him. “Well, doctor,” says he, groaningly, “glad
you’ve come.” Fancy of his to call me doctor, I º What a
change: FRASER's voice is quite altered. I reply, “Well, I hope I

conscious of the eyes of the Croquet party. I don't wave my hand

It is a point of wisdom to make

the country at large may as well
have the benefit of the transac-

might not the Legislature autho-
rise the CHANCELLoR or THE Ex-

of The Huguenot Captain.
The Captain has been
doing very well, and
MR, SHORE, who plays
the Duc d’Hamandreal (I. haven't kept a playbill, but the name is
something like that), has discarded the gorgeous dressing-gown which
I had (stupidly, Iown) thought, up till now, was the chief point, in
the plot. The ballet is simply, the best grotesque ballet that has
been seen for years in London or anywhere else, Paris included; and
it is not out of place here to mention the fact that its success. is
almost entirely due to M, MILANo, who, despite his name, is an English
Master of the Dance, and who invented, at the shortest possible notice,
this Bohemian ballet which has been the rage, ever since the first
night of its production. MR. WINING handsomely and substantially
acknowledged M. MILANo's services, as well as those of every one who,
on this occasion, worked with a will. I heartily, congratulate MR.
WINING on all past and present success, which his liberality thoroughly
deserves, and wish him the best luck for the future.
I went, Sir, to the Surrey Theatre, to see MR. SLOUs's play of True
to the Core. In brief, the plot is this. CRANMER's grandson, was
brought, as a treat, to see his worthy relative in the fire, and while he
was standing near the stake, his eye caught that of a naughty Jesuit,
who was making º (in the language of the boy of that
eriod, “cutting snooks”) at his (CRANMER's) respected grandfather.
nstead of knocking him down there and then, or getting him alone in
a corner, and “punching his 'ead for his himperence,” Young CRANMER
waited for nearly thirty years, following this Jesuit through a long
course of study in several Jesuitical colleges abroad, and at last tracking
him to England, and there denouncing him as a Spanish plotter against
QUEEN ElizaBETH and a Plymouth pilot. Mixed up with this very
original plot, is a seducer in large boots, a diffident Admiral Drake,
Sir Walter, Raleigh, without a pipe, a boisterous Walsingham, and
a gipsy girl of some strange tribe now lost, to our shores. The
Jesuit is the character, and a precious black character his is._This
play, you must know, gained the T. P. CookE prize; and, as M.P.'s
do occasionally offer little bribes here and there, it is not impro-
bable that MR WHALLEY, for purely Protestant purposes, sent gifts
unto the Selecting Committee, having first prompted MR. Slous to
write the drama. MR. WHALLEY knows how to convert the stage into
a mighty Protestant engine. MR. Slous obtained a hundred pounds as
his prize: the drama then, it appears, became the property of the
trustees under the T. P. CookE will, who take a share, as I am credibly
informed, in the nightly profits accruing to MEssRs. SHEPHERD and
CREswick, lessees of the Surrey, from the performance of this attractive
piece, while the author has never received, and, probably, never will re-
ceive, another penny. I hope this is not so; and for the sake of Trustees
and Managers, I sincerely trust that I am misinformed. I have alluded
to one Manager handsomely recognising the services of those to whom
he owes his success. Surely, then, something is due to the author for
the performance of a piece, over and above the award of the hundred
pounds’ prize, which he would have received independently of its pro-
duction! Let Mr. Punch hear some more of this ñºríº of

MR. CALCRAFT'S MINOR OPERATION.
As long as the columns of our contemporaries continue to present us
with Fº headed “Garotte Robbery,” so long will they gratify
us whenever they afford us such information as that which we proceed
to copy from the Times:–
“Flogging GARotters.-Three persons, named DANIEL and David BRYANT, and
WILLIAM PRENDERGAst, who were convicted at the last session of the Central
Criminal Court to be flogged prior to undergoing sentences of imprisonment and
penal servitude for robberies in the street, accompanied by personal violence,
underwent the most unpleasant and painful portion of their punishment on
Saturday in Newgate. The flogging was inflicted by a cat-o'-nine-tails by CALCRAFT."
Here, benevolent reader, you will perhaps pause. Knowing that
MR. CALCRAFT has now been some time before the public, you may be
apprehensive that the muscular power of that gentleman at his time of
life, though perfectly adequate to drawing a bolt, may, when a cat-of-
nine-tails is to be exercised on the back of a garotter, not be quite
| sufficient to produce the desired effect. You will be reassured by the
sequel of the foregoing narrative relative to the subjects on whom
MR. CALCRAFT j :-
“Although they were sentenced to receive 40 stripes, Mr. Grason, the surgeon
of the prison, felt himself justified in ordering CALCRAFT to desist after the
prisoners had received 20 lashes only.”
It is satisfactory to find that MR. CALCRAPT proved fully equal to
the occasion. The preceding statement has been found to require
some modification, but that only renders it the more satisfactory. The
ractical lesson in humanity which Michael, not DANIEL, and David
RYAN, not BRYANT, and BARTHoLoMEw, not WILLIAM, PRENDERGAST,
received from MR. CALCRAFT, was given to them on the 25th of Sep-
tember, and not on Goose Day or the Feast of St. Michael. The
Messrs. BRYAN had their full allowance of 40 lashes. It was only on
MR. PRENDERGAst that the executioner was obliged to abridge his
discipline. In that one case, however, the vigour of his arm was
amply demonstrated. Nevertheless, the next garotter MR. CALCRAFT
has to flog, more power to his elbow !

DR. MANNING AND HIS MASTER.
MR. PUNCH,
BEFoRE going over to Rome, except as a visitor, and before
agreeing to drink the health of the QUEEN after the Pope's, I should
like to ask DR. MANNING a few questions suggested by his late
Pastoral concerning his master's Temporal Power.
Is not the number of Popes, who have been persecuted since the
time of Constantin E THE GREAT, pretty considerable
If the Pope were to become mere Bishop of Rome, would anybody
who does not dare to persecute him now dare to persecute him then?
In case his Holiness were simply Bishop of Rome, who could pos-
sibly persecute him but the Constitutional Government of Italy P
Were the Italian Government to persecute him, could not the
Catholic Powers of Europe interfere for his protection as effectually as
they can now *
As long as the Pope continued to be an Italian subject, would not
º fºreign power that might attempt to coerce him have first to fight
taly
But, then, if the Papacy were deprived of the º power, would
not that be a signal demonstration of the fact that the Authority which
theoretically claims the right to govern the world is practically unequal
to the government of a petty territory?. Would not Popery thus lose
what in French is called prestige—in plain English the magical humbug
of a name? -
If the Most Reverend DR. MANNING knew his own mind would he
not know the affirmative of these last questions to be the real reason why
he and other Ultramontane Roman Catholics are so fearfully anxious
that the Sovereign Pontiff should be maintained in possession of his
temporal sovereignty P And would not the contraband ARCHBIshop
of WesTMINsTER also know that the consideration that, if the Pope
were only a spiritual Sovereign, the worldly consequence of dignitaries
of the Romish Church would be considerably diminished, is also some
reason why those dignitaries for the most part, object to the reduction
of the States of the Church to a kingdom which is not of this world?
Answers would oblige. Yours truly,
PHILALETHEs BLokE.
A CAUTION TO UN OBSERVANT YOUNG MEN.
Look well, BEFORE YOU TAKE UP You R Position AGAINST THE RAILs
BETTERING THE INSTRUCTION.
IN the “high-falutin” address presented by the Manchester Branch
of the Reform League to MR. BRIGHT last week, we find, among other
bursts of eloquence, the statement that “the voice of the metropolis of
the empire has echoed through the land. Hyde Park and #.
Street, to the venerable §. have been compactly filled with law-
respecting, freedom-loving multitudes of our fellow-countrymen,
solemnly resolved to regain those rights which a proud and over.
bearing minority still presumes to withhold from them.”—including,
yºne. the right to break windows, pick pockets, and tear down
rallings.
By way of practical comment on this, we read of the hop-pickers at
Loose Court, in Kent, the other day, striking work, arming themselves
with hop-poles, demolishing the bins in another garden, where abject
country hands, who hadn't been taught their rights by the League,
were engaged, and threatening their employers unless he raised the
terms they had agreed to work for, “to show him what Hyde Park
riot was like.”
Evidently, the voice of the metropolis of the empire, if it have not
echoed through the land, has .# in the Maidstone hop-grounds.
And the Loose Court hop-pickers seem to have viewed MR. Hodsoll,
in the light of the Manchester Address, as one of “the proud and over-
bearing minority” which “presumed to withhold their rights from the
law.respecting, freedom-loving” “roughs” out of the slums of West-
minster, the alleys of Whitechapel, and the courts of Bloomsbury.
Who henceforth will deny that the majestic Hyde Park demonstra-
tions have borne fruits—and that these are of them?
Commercial Intelligence.
Much anxiety has lately been felt in the City for the safety of a
well-known and long-established National Bank, but it is hoped that
the alarm may now be considered groundless. We allude to the Bank
of the Rhine, which, it is understood, is to be left alone—at least, for
the º-s, those who were disposed to take French leave and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ARTEMUS WARD IN LONDON.
MR. PUNCH, MY DEAR sº -
I skurcely need inform you that your excellent Tower is
very pop’lar with peple from the agricultooral districks, and it was
chiefly them class which I found waitin at the gates the other mornin.
I saw at once that the Tower was established on a firm basis... In
#." history of firm basisis I don't find a basis more firmer than
this one.
“You have no Tower in America?” said a man in the crowd, who
had somehow detected my denomination. - -
“Alars no,” I anserd; “we boste of our enterprise and improov-
ments, and yit we are devoid of a Tower. America, oh my onhappy
country thou hast not got no Tower! It’s a sweet Boon.”
The gates was opened after awhile, and we all purchist tickets, and
went into a waitin-room. - - -
d # frens,” said a pale-faced little man, in black close, “this is a
sad day.”
“Inasmuch as to how !". I said. -
“I mean it is sad to think that so many peple have been killed
within these gloomy walls. My frens, let us drop a tear !”
“No,” I said, “you must excuse me. Others may drop one if they
feel like it; but as for me, I decline. The early managers of this insti-
tootion were a bad lot, and their crimes was trooly orful; but I can't
sob for those who died four or five hundred years ago. If they was m
own relations I couldn’t. It’s absurd to shed sobs over things which
occurd durin the rain of HENRY THE THREE. Let us be cheerful,” I
continnerd. “Look at the festiv Warders, in their red, flannil
iº. They are cheerful, and why should it not be thusly with
us x
A Warder now took us in charge, and showed us the Trater's Gate,
the armers, and things. The Trater's Gate is wide enuff to admit about
twenty traters abrest, I should jedge; but beyond this, I couldn't see
that it was superior to gates in gen'ral.
Traters, I will here remark, are a onfortnit class of peple. If they
wasn’t, they wouldn't be traters. They conspire to bust up a country-
they fail, and they’re traters. They bust her, and they become states-
men and heroes.
Take the case of GLosTER, afterwards Old DICK THE THREE, who
may be seen at the Tower, on horseback, in a heavy tin overcoat-take
MR. GlostER's case. MR. G. was a conspiriter of the basist dye, and
if he’d failed, he would have been hung on a sour apple-tree. But
MR. G. succeeded, and became great. He was slewd by Col. Rich-
Mond, but he lives in histry, and his equestrian figger may be seen
daily for a six ence, in conjunction with other em'nent persons, and no
extry charge for the Warder's able and bootiful lectur.
There’s one king in this room who is mounted onto a foamin steed,
his right hand graspin a barber's pole. I didn't learn his name.
The room where the daggers and pistils and other weppins is kept
is interestin. Among this collection of choice cuttlery I notist the bow
and arrer which those hot-heded old chaps used to conduct battles
with. It is quite like the bow and arrer used at this day by certin
tribes of American Injuns, and they shoot 'em of with such a excellent
recision that I almost sigh’d to be a Injun, when I was in the Rocky
ountin regin. They are a pleasant lot, them. Injuns. , MR. Cooper
and DR. CATLIN have told us of the red man's wonerful eloquence,
and I found it so. Our party was stopt on the plains of Utah by a
band of Shoshones, whose chief said, “Brothers! the pale-face is wel-
come. Brothers! the sun is sinkin in the West, and WA-NA-BUCKY-
sHE will soon cease speakin. Brothers! the poor red man belongs to
a race which is fast becomin extink.” . He then whooped in a shrill
manner, stole all our blankets and whiskey, and fled to the primeval
forest to conceal his emotions.
I will remark here, while on the subjeck of Injuns, that they are
in the main a very shaky set, with even less sense than the Fenians,
and when I hear philanthropists bewailin the fack that every year
“carries the noble red man nearer the settin sun,” I simply have to say
I’m glad of it, tho' it is rough on the settin sun. They call you º
the sweet name of Brother one minit, and the next they scalp you wit
their Thomashawks. But I wander. Let us return to the Tower.
At one end of the room where the weppins is kept, is a wax figger of
QUEEN ELIZABETH, mounted on a fiery stuffed hoss, whose glass eye
flashes with pride, and whose red morocker nostril dilates hawtily, as
if conscious of the royal burden he bears. I have associated Eliza-
BETH with the Spanish Armady. She’s mixed up with it at the Surry
Theatre, where Troe to the Core is bein acted, and in which a full bally
core is introjooced on board the Spanish Admiral's ship, givin the
audiens the idee that he intends openin a moosic-hall in º the
moment he conkers that town. But a very interesting drammer is
Troo to the Core, notwithstandin the eccentric conduck of the Spanish
Admiral; and very nice it is in QUEEN ELIZABETH to make MARTIN
TRUEGold a baronet.
The Warder shows us some instrooments of tortur, such as thumb-
screws, throat-collars, etc., statin that these was conkerd from the
Spanish Armady, and addin what a crooil peple the Spaniards was in
them days—which elissited from a bright-eyed little girl of about twelve
summers the remark that she tho’t it was rich to talk about the crooilty
of the Spaniards usin thumb-screws, when we was in a Tower where
so many poor peple's heads had been cut off. This made the Warder
stammer and turn red.
. I was so pleased with the little girl's brightness that I could have
kissed the dear child, and I would if she'd been six years older.
I think my companions intended makin a day of it, for they all had
sandwiches, sassiges, etc. The sad-lookin man, who had wanted us to
drop a tear afore we started to go round, fling'd such quantities of
sassige into his mouth, that I expected to see him choke hisself to
death, he said to me, in the Beauchamp Tower, where the poor
* writ their onbappy names on the cold walls “This is a sad
sight.”
“It is, indeed,” I anserd. “You’re black in the face. , You
shouldn't eat sassige in public without some rehearsals beforehand.
You manage it orkwardly.”
“No,” he said, “I mean this sad room.”
Indeed, he was quite right. , Tho' so long ago, all these dreſful
things happened, I was very glad to git away from this gloomy room,
and go where the rich and sparklin Crown Jewils is kept. I was so
pleased with the QUEEN’s Crown, that it occurd to me what a
agree’ble surprise it would be to send a sim’lar one home to my wife;
and I asked the Warder what was the vally of a good, well-constructed
Crown like that . He told me, but on cypherin up with a pencil the
amount of funs I have in the Jint Stock Bank, I conclooded I’d send
her a genteel silver watch instid.
And so I left the Tower; . It is a solid and commandin edifis, but I
deny that it is cheerful. I bid it adoo without a pang.
I was droven to my hotel by the most melancholly driver of a four-
wheeler that I ever saw. He heaved a deep sigh, as I gave him two
shillins. “I’ll give you six d’s more,” I said, “if it hurts you so.”
“It isn’t that,” he said, with a hart-rendin groan, “it’s only a way
I have. My mind’s upset to-day. ... I at one time, tho't I'd drive you
into the Thames. I’ve been readin all the daily papers to try and
understand about Gover Nor AYRE, and my mind is totterin. It’s really
wonderful I didn't drive you into the Thames.” -
I asked the onbappy, man what his number was, so I could º
find him in case I should want him agin, and bad him good-bye. An
then I tho’t what a frollicksome .# 'd made of it.
Respectably, &c.

LADIES AND THEIR LUGGAGE.
ONE finds in our old Comedies the term “baggage” applied on some
occasions to a woman, at times as an endearment and at times as a
reproach. The word is well nigh obsolete, but we think that it might
be revived with some propriety, in its latter sense at any rate, when we
notice in the newspapers such paragraphs as this:-
“The American public have been greatly astonished by the announcement that
MADAME R — requires 107 trunks and boxes to carry her personal baggage--a
number far in excess of the standard heretofore necessary for a Saratoga balle in
full fashion.”
What luggage may be needful for a Saratoga belle we are not com-
º to guess. Peradventure eighty trunks and boxes may content
her, or indeed, if they be big ones, fifty may suffice. Ladies here in
London now go about in trains, but the Saratoga swellesses must go
about in luggage trains, for every lady must require a dozen railway
trucks at least for all the luggage that she takes with her. When we

Notes written down soon after my arrival at Fraser's.—The groom who
took me in the pony carriage was not quite certain which was Furze
cottage. After going up a considerable hill we came to a door which
seemed to appear suddenly out of a plantation. There was nothing
outside to indicate that it belonged to the FRASERs, or anybody else.
Here I find notes made on the spot.

repeat my question, and he repeats his faces, , I threaten him, when he
suddenly disappears, having, as I hope, tumbled off a chair. If this is
the FRASERs, they have children, or at all events one child, who makes
faces at visitors. I don’t like this. -
Why the groom on seeing the child should say, “Oh, yes, this is
Furze Cottage,” I don’t know : on looking again at the window I
catch sight of a comely nurserymaid, and from, certain indications on
her countenance I am inclined to think that the groom is upon, at all
events, winking terms with the domestic. The groom gets out to ring
the bell while I hold the reins. I am glad when he has rung, and is at
the pony’s head.
appy Thought.—Must practise my driving.
A youngish butler opens the door, he lacks the stateliness of the
archbishop at Furze Lodge, but he is dapper and genial; and a butler
should be genial. Wishing to do things well for the sake of the FRASERs,
and with a view to reading the Duke's groom the useful lesson that a
menial mustn't despise º who may happen to be shown out of a
nobleman's house, I give him half-a-crown. I watched the effect upon
him. None, visibly. Turning suddenly, a few seconds afterwards, I am
confident I saw him with the half-crown in his right eye, pretending to
ogle the nurserymaid at the window. Analysing this act subsequently,
(with a view to materials for chapter on Human Nature), I find in it
ingratitude, immorality and tomfoolery. [Query. Why Tom foolery
why not Henry-foolery or John-foolery. Must think over this, an
startle the world when I’ve found it out.]
# Thought.—That groom 's a Lothario. Who was Lothario?
Useful thing to get a history of him. Everybody is hearty at FRASERs.
The butler and the footman are hearty. They get out my lug
heartily. They hang up my hat, on a peg in the hall, heartily. #.
butler putting down my hat-box" thinks that that’s all,” heartily. The
footman thinks yes, that that is all, very heartily. . They smile at one
another and breathe, heartily. I begin to feel hearty myself. The
load of the aristocracy is off me, now that the Duke's groom (much
worse than the Duke #: as oppressing me, until I saw him with
my coin in his right eye) is gone. f notice that there are about ten pairs
of little shoes, and hoops, and hoopsticks in the hall. The FRASERs
have evidently a large family. Didn't know this before. MRs. PLYTE
FRASER comes in from the garden. She talks in italics, most heartily;
“So glad to see me: so delighted : so sorry if I hadn’t come: should
never have forgiven me: never. You’ll have a cup of tea? We’re
just come in º: tea; and a chat : so long since we’ve had a chat.”
MRs. FRASER then gives some directions about MASTER ADOLPHUs
coming down to , dinner, and the others to dessert. ...Very large
family, I'm afraid. Asking for FRASER, I am told he is arranging
a bin. I, like MRs. PLYTE FRASER, , she is thoroughly appre-
ciative. She is fond of literature, specially, of the higher walks in
which I am engaged, and she interests herself in what interests me.
I shall get her to give me an opinion on the first Chapter of Typical
Developments. A clever woman's opinion is worth a great deal; and
then, of course, she represents a class. Now my mistake in appealing
at all to Boopsis was, that he didn't represent anybody.
Odd question for Miss. FRASER to put to me, almost directly we are
in the drawing-room, “So you're not married yet?” I laugh, and
reply, “No, I’m not married yet,” having, in fact, no other answer
ready. She returns, knowingly, “Well, we’ll see what we can do for
you?” I smile, but I don’t quite like this style of conversation.

Analysing it, subsequently, for materials for chapter on Human,Nature,
I find in it frivolity and curiosity. I take this opportunity while we’re

Laura. “OH, CHARLEs, Do RUN to KITTY | SHE DAREN'T come oN, AND HER Pony is canny.ING ALL THE BEST of THE LUNCHEoN "
OUR SOCIAL CHURCH SCIENCE CONGRESS,
(From Our Colucell-Hatchney Correspondent.)
I’ve been quiet, haven't I, for a long time. But what of that? Is
it because a Briton must never be a slave that therefore he is to submit
to tyranny ?, Never! Our Christmas holidays are put off until, Mid:
summer, and we, the students of Colwell-Hatchney, have complained
in consequence. There was a grand demonstration which no one was
able to attend, for reasons which are easier described than imagined.
But we have had a Social Church Congress. All shades of opinion
§. ºvesented including sun-shades, lamp-shades, and PEPPER's
OSt.
To prevent any unseemly squabbling, it was provided that there
should be no argument above a whisper, unless enforced at the point
of the bayonet. ; on the flute was strictly prohibited, Peri-
winkles admitted half price: No shrimps, except by voucher. Evening
dress at first: afterwards Harlequin." Villains of the deepest dye can
only be admitted under ten years of age free.
On the evening of the eleventh ultimo, which followed, as you may
remember, the sixty-first proximo ſquartered in Ireland for the time
being, the Congress was held as tightly as possible in the Dormitory,
after the lights were put out., Thousands were unable tojº. admit-
tance. In spite of the crowded state of the place, a proposal was made
tº open the ceiling, and let in a few of our weaker brethren in the room
above. This was negatived by five, armed with fire-shovels, to one, with-
out. They then shook hands, and got to their corners.
The Mºº divided into Sections. One Section that liked it,
and one that didn't. Another Section that hated it whatever it was
and another that only knew it to love it. They all wreathed the bowl
with smiles. The extreme Ritualist party, who were scarcely, to be
detected from the Anti-rittles in the dark, wore nightgowns and caps,
according to their degrees; Qne wore a splendid robe of 60 degrees in
the shade. At 8:30 the clock, struck nine, and all was delirious joy.
the first cessation of hostilities, several members wanted to adjourn
to the infirmary. (Cries of “Kah/?” “Coward /* “Sneak /*)
A gentleman calling himself the Bishop of Hippopotamus asked the
first question, “Do you bruise your oats?” (Cries of “Shut up /*
“Brute?” “You’re Another /* and so forth.)
. An Apology was then read from an Oratorio who was to have en-
livened the proceedings. In his absence the Hailstone Chorus was
erformed by all the students. Every available instrument was used.
The effect was electrical; in fact, the Principal of the ºf: came in
and owned that he was shocked. (Meeting adjourned until he’d gone.)
On re-meeting, a representative of the Irish Church asked any one to
tread on the tail of his night-gown. Here shillelaghs were introduced,
and ten minutes were allowed for refreshment. Time called. Hunt
the slipper and other amusements served to pass . another hour
or so, and when Aurora with her snowy streaks brought happiness to
the fair maiden who dwells on the tower (admission fee to warder
sixpence), then, and not till then, did the party separate, throwin
boots and shoes at each other's heads for good luck. The good º:
was, not to get much hurt. The casualties are still unreported; but
all acknowledged that they had spent a rational and truly instructive
evening.
==
THE WAY TO WOMANEIOOD SUFFRAGE.
THE cause of Womanhood Suffrage was ably pleaded by MADAME
BARBARA BoDiction, at the Social Science Congress, , and MADAME
BoDichoN was º followed, on the same line by DR. MARY
WALKER. It may safely be said that if every man is fit to vote, so is
every woman; on conditions. These, of course, are, that if women
are to exercise political functions, like men, they must accept all the
obligations of the sterner sex. For instance, the right of yoting would
give women a voice in the organisation of the army...This ought not
to exist apart from liability to be drawn for the Militia, or to become
subject to conscription, if that method of recruiting should come to be
adopted in this country. The ladies who sigh for the suffrage should
lose no time in enrolling themselves in regiments of Amazonian volun-
teers to signify that whilst they demand the rights, they are ready to
accept the duties of citizenship.

MAKING THE MOST OF IT, AND HOW TO Do IT.

YRON's §. of Manfred, which in my edition is printed
wrongly thus:–
“I should be sole in this sweet solitude,
And with the Spirit of the place divide
The sovereignty of these waters.",
. Clearly, the word “place” ought to, have an “i”
in it. y one may see that with only half an eye.
From the context it is obvious that “plaice” the fish
is here alluded to, and not “place” the locality. By
the emphasis which is laid upon the two words “sole”
and “plaice,” it is clear that an antithesis is marked
between two fish. Spirits, we know, are often found
in water, and I can see no reason why they should
not exist in fish. At any rate, I fancy that the passage
I have cited is a good proof that Lord ByRoN, fully
entertained the notion, that Spirits do exist; and this,
no doubt, will be considered extremely satisfactory to
those who think that Spirits are really

HAPPY THOUGHTS.
(An Intellectual Dinner and Musical Evening at Furze Cottage.)
Notes made at intervals during the evening, collected at night.
At Dinner. In consequence of having to listen to several whispered
observations on the company present from MRs. PLYTE FRASER, who
tells me who every one is, and how clever they all are, I find myself
left, alone, eating fish, I make three picks at my fish and finish. The
butler and footman are both in the room, but neither will catch my
eye, and I can't § my plate removed. The coachman, who comes in
to wait occasionally, and is very hot and uncomfortable all, the time,
does catch my eye, and sees me pointing to my plate. He looks in a
frightened manner at me, as though begging me not to ask him to do
anything on his own account. He is evidently debating with himself
whether he oughtn't to tell the butler that I’m making signs. I
should say that this coachman is snubbed by the others. His rule for
waiting º: to be, when in doubt play the lobster sauce; which he
hands with everything.
MRs. FRASER whispers to me to draw the American General out.
“He was in the war,” she says, behind her fan. Isay, “Oh, indeed!”
and commence the process of drawing out. It’s a difficult art. The
first question is everything. I ask him, diffidently, “How he liked the
war?” Before he can reply, MRs. FRASER informs the company, as if
she were, exhibiting the military hero, “Ah! GENERAL DUNcAMMON
was in all the great engagements—” The General shuts his eye and
nods towards a salt-cellar. “He knew,” she continues, still exhibiting
him, “all the leading men there—” The General looks round the
table cautiously to see, perhaps, if anybody else did, “and he was in the
very centre of the battle, where he received a dreadful sabre wound, at—
at—” she looks for assistance to the General, who seems rather more
staggered than he probably did in the battle, and PLYTE FRASER,
from the top of the table, supplies, “Bull's Run.” “Bull's Run,”
repeats. MRS. FRASER to the General, as if challenging him to con-
tradict it if he dares. “GENERAL DUNCAMMON's property,’” she goes
on, still ºf on him as a kind of mechanical wax-work figure,
“was all—all—all—dear me, what’s the word I want?” She turns
to me abruptly. I don't know. The General doesn't know. Every-
body being appealed to, separately, “has the word on the tip of his
tongue!” “You,” says MRs. FRASER to me, “of course have
quite a storehouse of words.

to say what you want, you know. Now what is the word I’m waiting

ment—taken away—not ‘compromised’—no–dear me—” All eyes
are upon me. Of course. I know. Boldly but with a nervous feeling
that I’m not quite right yet, I say, “Sequestered,” and lean back in
my chair.
Happy Thought.—Sequestered.
MRs. FRASER adopts it... “Sequestered by Government.” Miss
HARDING goes into a fit of laughing. I see the mistake, so does
MRs. FRASER, so does every one. Everyone laughs. They all think
it's my joke, and MRs. FRASER taps me on the hand with her fan and
I never can imagine an author without a |}
explains to the General “sequestered you know for sequestrated.”
Everyone laughs again, except, Miss HARDING, who, MRs., FRASER
keeps whispering to me is “such a clever girl, so well read. Draw
her out.” She won’t be drawn out any more than the General. The
party, I subsequently find, has been asked expressly to meet me, and
the FRASERs do, their best to give º a literary turn. Odd;
I don't feel a bit brilliant this evening. Very disappointing this must
be to the guests. I can’t even talk to Miss HARDING. In consequence
of what is expected of me, I can't stoop to talk about the weather, or
what anyone’s “been doing to-day.” After the haunch of yenison. I
am going to begin to Miss HARDING about “the Human Mind in its
several aspects,” when she says, “I thought you authors were full of
conversation and sparkling wit.” It’s rather rude of her, but MRs.
FRASHR shouldn't lead her tº expectºmºh. sI can ºnly sº. Did
you?”. As an afterthought I ask “Why?” She replies, “Well, one
reads of the meetings of such men as SHERIDAN, BURKE, GRATTAN,
DR. Johnson, and they seem to have said witty things every moment,”
I feel that I am called upon to defend the literary character for esprit
in the present day... I reply, “Well you see,” deliberately, “it’s so
different now, it’s in fact more—” I am interrupted by a gentle-
man, on the other side, in a white waistcoat and iron-grey whiskers,
“No wits now-a-days,” he says. “Why I recollect ColeRIDGE
Count D'ORSAY, Scott, SouTHEY and ToMMy MooRE, with old
MAGINN, Sir, at one table. Then, Sir, there was poor Hook, and

thought of ~ He says this as if he’d done something clever in
being born when he was, and as if I’d made an entire mistake in
choosing my time for an existence. Every one is attending, to the
gentleman in the white waistcoat, who defies contradiction, because
all his stories are of a time before any one at the table “was born
or thought of.” It’s very annoying that there should ever have been
such a period.
Happy Thought.—In Chap. X., Book IX. of Typical Developments. “The
Vanity of Existence.” From literature he gets to the Drama. He seems
to remember every actor. According to him, no one ever did anything
in literature or art, without asking his advice. His name is BRounton,
and he speaks of himself in the third person as HARRY. I try to speak
to Miss HARDING, but she is º: to a story from BROUNToN
about “Old MATHEws.” “You didn't know old MATHEws,” he says
to FRASER, who humbly admits he didn't...“Ah, I recollect, before he
ever thought of giving his entertainment, his coming to me and sa ing;

says he, ‘I’d give a hundred pounds to be able to sing and speak like

dren. I see the one who made faces at me from the window.

it’s in your room, you know : we got such a lot of things in it.” . I
don't like to tell MRs. FRASER, who says, “There, Doñy, don't be
troublesome.” I am distracted. The boy on the side of MRs. FRASER
(he was the nuisance in the croquet ground) says, #." at me
“Oh, he's got such a funny hat,” and is immediately silenced, should
like to hear more about this hat. I ask, Dolly, who whispers,
“the nurse, took it away from him, 'cos, she said that he 'd hurt
himself.” The little FRASERs have evidently been smashing my
ibus. The ladies rise, and the children go with them. “You won’t stop
ong,” says MRs. FRASER, persuasively. “No, no,” answers FRASER.
“Because, I’ve allowed the children to sit up on purpose,” continues
MRs, FRASER, looking at me. “All right, returns FRASER; “we’ll
just have one glass of wine and then we’ll come into the º;
room, and ”—smiling on me—“he’ll give us ‘The Little Pig Jumped,’
with the squeak and all.”
I find that all the guests have been asked expressly to hear me sing
this: I also find that there are a great many people coming in the evening
for the same special purpose. I haven’t done it for years. FRASER
seems to think that any man who writes is merely a buffoon. I only
wonder that he doesn’t ask me to dance a saraband for the amusement
of his friends. I am astonished at MRs. FRASER. I tell FRASER I’ve
forgotten the song. He won't hear of it; he says, “You’ll remember Cl
it as you go on.” I say, I can’t get on without a good accompaniment.
He returns that the Elder Miss Sympe Rson plays admirably. Every
one says, “Oh, you must sing.” The American General who speaks
for the first time, now says, “He’s come ten miles to hear it.” BRoun-
TON i. “I don't recollect Old MATHEws at Home?” I don't,
and he has me at a disadvantage.
He goes on to ask me if I accompany myself? No, I don't. . “Ah!”
says he, “I recollect THEODoRE. Hook sitting down to the piano and
dashing off a song and an accompaniment impromptu. You don’t
improvise?” he asks me. I am obliged to own frankly that I do not,
but in the tone of one who could if he liked. “Ah,” he goes on, “you
should hear the Italian Improvvisatori! Ever been to Italy P" No, I
haven't.: he has, and again I am at a disadvantage. “Ah,” he exclaims,
“ that is something like improvisation: such fire and humour—more
than in the French. Of course you know all BéRANGER's songs by
heart?”. Before I have time to say that I know a few, he is off
again: Ah! the French comic songs are so light and sparkling.
No English comic song can touch, them—and then, where are your
singers?” ... I wish to goodness he'd not been asked to hear “The
Iittle Pig.'. Going out of the dining-room, FRASER says to me,
“Capital fellow, BROUNTON, isn't he so amusing.” If I don't admit
it FRASER will think me envious and ill-natured; so I say heartily,
“BRouston very amusing fellow—great fun,”—and we are in the
drawing-room.
Here I find all the people who have been invited in the evening.

will be happy to play for me, is seated near the piano. She is half a
head taller than P. § thin, and very dry. y last chance is try-
ing to frighten her out of accompanying me. I tell her, the tune is
difficult to catch. Will I hum it to her? I hum it to her. Two children
standing by the piano give their version of it. I say, “hush” to them,
and lose the tune. Miss SYMPERson does catch it, and chooses a ke

was’—when f have to explain that we’re not ready to begin yet. The
conversation is resumed: MRS, FRASER seats herself on an ottoman
with her two very youngest children, who are fidgety, near the piano;
the two others insist on standing just in front of me łº Miss
HARDING takes a small chair quite close to me; by her sits a Captain
some-one, who has come in the evening with his sister. I feel that she
despises buffoonery, but if the ºf: is to be anything at all, it
must be done with a good deal of facial expression. The Captain is
evidently joking with her at my expense., Don't know him, but hate
im: because it’s very ungentlemanly and unfair to laugh at you, just
when you’re going to sing a comic song. I tell FRASER, apologetically,
that I really am afraid I shall break down. BRouxton says, “Never
mind—improvise.” Miss SYMPERSON says, “Shall. I, begin?” ... I
answer, “If you please,” and she Fº what she thinks is the air.
I am §§ to stop her, and say that it’s not quite correct. This
makes a hitch to begin with., BROUNTON says something about a
tuning-fork, and everyone laughs except the Captain, who is talking
in a low tone to Miss HARDING. MRS, FRASER's youngest child on
her lap, says, “Ma, why—doo-de”— Hush! Miss Syxperson, in
not a particularly goo temper, plays it again. More like a march
than a comic song, but I don’t like to tell her so. I begin—
“A little pig lived on the best of straw,
Straw—hee—haw—and Shandiddlelaw."
And the idea flashes across my mind what an ass I'm making of º
At the “hee-haw,” the pianist has to do six notes up and down, like a
donkey braying. This is one of the points of the song. Miss SYM-
PERSON doesn't do it. I hear, afterwards, that she thought it vulgar,
and omitted it purposely. I go on—
“Lillibullero, lillibullero, lillibullero,
Shandiddlelan,
My daddy's a bonny wee man.”
. I feel it is idiotic. , Miss SyMPERSON plays a bar too much. She
didn't know I finished there. I beg she won't apologise. Next verse—
“This little pig's mother she was the old sow,
Ow, ow, ow and Shandiddleow.”
I feel it’s more idiotic than ever. Here I see Miss HARDING ex:
changing glances with the Captain, , and MRs. FRASER with several
ladies; they raise their eyebrows and look grim. I suddenly recollect
I’ve got some rather broad verses coming. The idea also occurs to
me for the first time that when FRASER did hear me sing it, years
# it was amongst a party of bachelors after supper. I go on with
ibullero, and have half a mind to give it up altogether:—
“The Farmer's wife went out for a walk,
Walk, ork, ork, and shandiddle lork.
“I fancy,” says she, “a slice of good pork.”
This I used to do, I remember, with a wink and making a face like a
own. I risk it. I feel I don't do it with spirit, and nobody laughs.
I see BRounTON whisper behind his hand to the American General
and I am sure that he’s “seen old MATHEws do this verything,” or
something of that sort. Getting desperate I make more hideous faces
in the Lillibullero chorus. ISS # ARDING looks down, the ladies
regard, one another curiously, I believe they think I’ve had too much
wine, the ugly * by the piano, begins to imitate my faces, and the
youngest in arms bursts into a violent fit of tears. Miss SYMPERson
stops. The child won't be comforted. MRs. FRASER tells the wretched
little brat that “the gentleman won’t make any more ugly faces, he
won't.” And turning to me, asks me to sing it without the grimaces:
“They can't,” she argues, “be a necessity;” and FRASER reminds me,
tº: that when I sang it before, I didn’t make those faces.
have a mind to ask him (being rather nettled) what faces I did
make? The result is, however, to set the two boys off making faces
at their little sisters, for which they are very nearly being ordered off to
bed instantly. Miss SYMPERSON asks me, “Shall I go on " " I say,
despondently, “yes, if you please, we may as well.”
“The farmer's wife was fond of a freak,
Eak, eak, eak, and shandiddleleak,
And she made the little pig squeak, squeak, squeak.”
Here used to follow the imitation. I think it better not to do it now
and am proceeding with the next verse when FRASER says, “Hallot
I say, do the squeak”, I tell him I can't, I don't feel up to it. He
says, “Oh, do try.” I hear Miss HARDING, say, “Oh, do try.” The
Captain, too, remarks (I see his eye) “He hopes. I’ll, try,”
BRounton hopes the same thing, and then tells something about Hook
(probably) behind his hand to the General. I say, “Very well,” and
yield. I begin squeaking: I shut my eyes, and squeak: I open them
and squeak... I try it four times, but am obliged to own publicly “that
there is no fun in it, unless you’re in cue for it.” No one seems in
cue for it. The children begin squeaking, and are all packed off to
bed. É'. begin to resume the conversation. I say to FRASER I
don’t think there’s any use in going on with the song? He answers,
“Oh, yes, do-do by all means.” But as he is not by any means enthu:
siastic about it, I thank, Miss SYMPERSON, who acknowledges it
very stiffly and coldly, and cuts me for the remainder of the even-
ing. BROUNTON comes up and tells me loudly, “That he re-
members old MATHEws, doing that song, or something exactly like
it, years ago; it was admirable.” Miss FLORELLY asks me quietly.
“If I’d written many songs.” I disown the authorship of the pig,
The Captain sings a sentimental ballad about “Meet me where t

IGNORANCE AND FASHION.
Rustic (paralysed). “My THERE's A PRIs'NER 'scAPED FROM JAIL, with HER CHAINs on !”
POOR JOHN BULL'S PRESTIGE.
WE have kept clear of foreign contention,
Of the Russian stronghold since our siege,
So, by reason of non-intervention, ..
We are told we have lost our prestige.
Had we deemed interference our mission,
There is reason, truth bids us allow,
To believe that our present position
Would be other than what it is now.
- Had we fought to save Denmark from plunder,
We a generous act should have done,
And committed a chivalrous blunder,
Matching Enfield against needle-gun.
Great renown a campaign would have brought us!
In the Duchies, a brave British band
That which Austria's example has taught UlS,
Would have long ago learned at first hand.
On the side of Secession º -
Had been boldness whereof we might brag ;
And the Stars and the Stripes would be waging,
At this time, war against Britain's flag.
And on either side Ironsides º
The Atlantic, might now, foe and oë,
Shot for shot on the waves be exchanging,
For the messages crossing below.
Suits of black, and crape hatbands, surrounding
On all hands, would denote them that grieve;
Wooden legs we should see, too, abounding:
so many an empty coat-sleeve,
And, at best, a solution no better
Ö: disputes than what Europe has found,
With thine Income Tax, national debtor,
At some two or three shillings a pound.
If the loss of prestige has pain in it, -
In our case there’s this salve for the sore,
That we might, in attempting to win it,
Have i. lost it and also much more.
And prestige is a consideration
Of small weight as compared with expense.
Butlet no cost be spared by this nation
That it needs to insure its defence.

IN LONDON.
R PUNCH, MY BEAR SIR,-
I was a little disapinted in
not receivin a invitation
to jine in the meetins of the
Social Science Congress.
I don't exackly see how
tly got on without me.
hope it wasn't the in-
tentions of the Sciencers
to exclood me from their
delibrations.
Let it pars. I do not
replne. et us remember
Hoxier. Twenty cities

which the livin MR.
How ER couldn't have got
trusted for a sandwich and
a glass of bitter beer, or
words to that effeck.
But perhaps it was a
oversight. rtinly I have
been hosspitably, rec'd, in
this country. Hospitality
has been pored all over me.
At Liverpool I was asked to walk all over the docks, which are nine miles
long; and I don't remember a instance since my 'rival in London of
my gettin into a cab without a Briton comin and perlitely shuttin the
door for me, and then extendin his open hand to'ards me, in the most
frenly manner possible. Does he not, by this simple yit tuchin ges-
ture, welcum me to England?, Doesn't he Oh, yes—I guess he
doesn't he. And it’s quite right among two great countries which
speak the same langwidge, except as regards H’s...And I've been
allowed to walk round the streets. Even at Buckingham Pallis, I
told a guard I wanted to walk round there, and he said I could walk
round there. I ascertained subsequent that he referd to the side-walk
instid of the Pallis—but I couldn't doubt his hosspital feelins, , .
I prepared a Essy on, Animals to read, before the Social Science
meetins. It is a subjeck I may troothfully say I have successfully
wrastled with. I tackled it when only nineteen years, old. At that
tender #: I writ a Essy for a lit'ry Institoot, entitled, “Is Cats to be
Trusted?” Of the merits of that Essy it doesn't becum me to speak,
but I may be excoos'd for mentionin #. the Institoot parsed a reso-
lution that “whether we look upon the length of this Essy, or the
manner in which it is written, we feel that we will not, express any
opinion of it, and we hope it will be read in other towns.”
Of course the Essy I writ for the Social Science Society is a more
finisheder production than the one on Cats, which was wroten, when
my mind was crood, and afore I had masterd a graceful and ellygant
stile of composition. I could not even punctooate my sentences proper
at that time, and I observe with pane, on lookin over this effort of m
yooth, that its beauty is in one or two instances mar'd by ingrammati.
cisms. This was unexcusable, and I’m surprised I did it. A writer
who can't write in a grammerly manner better shut up shop.
You shall hear this Essy on Animals. Some day when you have
four hours to spare, I’ll read it to you. I think you'll enjoy it. Or,
what will be much, better, if I may suggest—omit all picturs in next
week's Punch, and do not let your contributors write anything what-
ever (let them have a holiday; they can go to the British Mooseum;
and publish my Essy intire. It will fill all your collumes full, an
create comment. Does this proposition strike you? Is it a go?
In case I had read the Essy to the Social Sciencers, I had intended
it should be the closin attraction ºf had intended it should finish the
proceedins. I think it would have finished them. I understand ani-
mals better than any other class of human creatures. I have a very
animal mind, and I’ve been identified with 'em doorin my entire per-
fessional career as a showman, more especial bears, wolves, leopards,
and . - -
The º: is as lively a animal as I ever came into contack with.
It is troo he cannot change his spots, but you can change ’em for him
with a paint-brush, as I once did in the case of a leopard who wasn't
nat'rally spotted in a attractive manner. In exhibitin him I used to
stir him up in his cage with a protracted pole, and for the purpuss ºf
makin yell and kick up in a leopardy manner, I used to 'casionally
whack him over the head. This would make the children inside the
booth scream with fright, which would make fathers of families outside
the booth very anxious to come in—because there is a large class of
parents who have a uncontrollable passion for takin their children to
places where they will stand a chance of being frightened to death.
One day I whacked this leopard more than ushil, which elissited a
remonstrance from a tall gentleman in spectacles, who said, “My good
man, do not beat the poor caged animal. , Rather fondle him.”
; iii fondle him with a club,” I anserd, hitting him another whack.

I understand the idiosyncracies of these creeturs
better than you do.” With that he went up to the cage, and thrustin
his face in between the iron bars, he said, soothinly, “Come hither,
pretty creetur.” The pretty creetur come-hithered rayther speedy,
and seized the gentleman º the whiskers, which he tore off about enuff
to stuff a small cushion with. -
He said, “You vagabone, I’ll have you indicted for exhibitin
dangerous and immoral animals.”
I replied, “Gentle Sir, there isn't a animal here that hasn't a beauti-
ful moral, but you mustn't fondle 'em. You mustn't meddle with their
idiotsyncracies.”
The gentleman was a dramatic cricket, and he wrote a article for a
paper, in which he said my Entertainment was a decided failure.
As regards Bears, you can teach 'em to do interestin things, but
they're onreliable. had a very large grizzly bear once, who would
dance, and larf, and lay down, and bow his head in grief and give a
mournful wale, etsetry. But he often annoyed me. It will be remem.
bered that on the occasion of the first battle of Bull Run, it suddenly
occurd to the Fed'ral soldiers that they had business in Washington
which ought not to be neglected, and they all started for that beautiful
and romantic city, maintainin a rate of speed durin the entire distance
that would have done credit to the celebrated French steed, Gladiateur.
Very nat'rally our Gov'ment was deeply grieved at this defeat; and I
said to my Bear, shortly after, as I was givin a exhibition in Ohio-I
said, “ Brewin, are you not sorry the National arms has sustained a
defeat?” . His business was to wale dismal, and bow his head down,
the band (a barrel orgin and a widlin) Pºli slow and melancholly
moosic. What did the grizzly old cuss do, however, but commence
darncin and larfin in the most joyous manner. , I had a marrer escape
from being imprisoned for ſºlº I will relate another incident in
the career of this retchid Bear. I used to present what I called in
the bills A Beautiful living Pictur—showing the Bear's fondness for
his Master: in which I’d lay down on a piece of carpeting, and the
Bear would come and lay down beside me, restin his right paw on my
brest, the Band playing “Home, Sweet Home,” very soft and slow.
Altho' I say it, it was a tuchin thing to see. I’ve seen Tax-Collectors
weep over that performance. ..
ell, one day I, said, “Ladies and Gentlemen, we will now show
łº the Bear's fondness for his master,” and I went and laid down;
tho't I observed a pecoolia ºxpression into, his eyes, as he rolled
clumsily to'ards me, but I didn't dream of the scene which follerd.
He laid down and put his p" on my breast. “Affection of the Bear
for his Master,” I repeated. “You see the Monarch of the Western
Wilds in a subjugated state. Fierce as these animals natrally are, we
now see that they have hearts, and can love. This Bear, the largest
in the world, and measurin seventeen feet round the body, loves me as
a mer-ther loves her che-ild!” . But what was my horror when the
grizzly and infamus Bear threw his other paw under me, and riz with
me to his feet. Then claspin me in a close embrace he waltzed up and
down the platform in a frightful manner, I yellin with fear and anguish.

by bein in the way when a hevily loaded gun was fired off by one of
my men.
But you should hear º Essy which I wrote for the Social Science
Meetins. It would have had a movin effeck on them.
I feel that I must now conclood.
I have read EARL BRIGHT's speech at Leeds, and I hope we shall now
hear from John DeRºy. I trust that not only they, but W.M. E.
STANLEY and Loko GLADSTONE will cling inflexibly to those great
fundamental º which they understand far better than I do, and
I will add that I do not understand anything about any of them
whatever in the least—and let us all be happy, and live within our
means, even if we have to borrer money to do it with.

A Compromise with a Cloud.
THE important question of smoking in Railway carriages might be
satisfactorily settled if an Act of Parliament were passed as i. aS
ossible next Session, compelling every Railway traveller who indulges
in a cigar or a pipe to consume his own smoke.
WHY AND BECAUSE.
Why is the KING of PRUssia like an exorcist
Because he has dispossessed his neighbours.

It seems an impossibility for two silly lovers ever to agree, seeing
that between them there can be no understanding.

THE APOLOGY OF THE YARMOUTH
BLOATER.
|
HERE's your regular Yarmouth Bloater,
Free and º Voter,
If you like, a Ten-pound-noter,
And as much more as may be.
Where's my virtue P, Safe, I’ve hid her
In my pocket. I consider
Him that is the highest bidder
For my vote, the man for me.
In no party name I glory,
Stand not in the category
Either of a Whig or Tory. .
But I always give my voice
For a Liberal politician.
Answering to my definition.
Liberal hand's the one condition
For the Member of my choice.
Talk to me of conscience? Gammon'
What care I which side I am on ?
To the market as a salmon
Let your Bloater go—to sell.
Even if my inclination
Were to form some valuation
Of the best man for the nation,
That is more than 1 can tell.
Say I were to sky a copper,
And to vote for tail or topper,
Would that method be more proper
Than the course which I pursue?
Why, if I’ve no better reason
For my choice at polling season,
Should I not, which side I please on,
Vote for lucre as I do
Sold again and got the money!
“Sugar” is more sweet than honey.
Let me, whilst the time is sunny,
Domy best at making hay.
Sugar ! I will not refuse it
For my suffrage. Must I lose it
Knowing not how else to use it?
Will you take my vote away
ROME AND ITS DEFENDERS.
The Foreign Legion has made its entry into Rome—in the midst of
that profoundest mark of respect-dead silence. We are told that its
organisation is excellent; its officers picked men; its uniforms very
elegant; and that, in fact, it is a corps of the French army under a
foreign º This explains what puzzled dull people in the EMPEROR's
Lavalette letter, the sentence, about, the army of occupation being
withdrawn, to be replaced by the shadow of French protection. This
is the protection in question, and if it throw a shadow on Rome, Rome
returns the compliment, and looks black on it.
But if the Romans scowl and are silent, the Vatican has a warm
welcome for its new defenders. They were feasted in the Belvedere
adorned for the occasion with Gobelin tapestry—the ghost of a temporai

and myrtle–the olive being omitted, no doubt, as superfluous, where
NAPoiroN and PIUs THE NINTH are ruling powers. Don’t we all
know L'Empire c’est la Pair; and isn’t the Pontiff the Prince of peace
in propriá persond? Then what need of the olive-branch?
The end of the saloon was occupied by a plaster model of the colossal
statue of the Immaculate Conception. ere is something very neat
in the adaptation of material to dogma. What could be better than
plaster (Plaster of Paris, no doubt, out of compliment to the Eldest
Son of the Church) for a model of the Immaculate Conception—plaster
as immaculate as the conception, and as easily, crumbled into dust as
the doctrine And under the statue—as he has bent his neck under
the dogma—stood the bust of PIUs THE NINTh—a hollow white head,
without arms to use, or legs to run away.
The table of the superior officers was separated from the other eight
tables—what should officers and rank and file have in common in such
a service?—by an artificial garden, º: us º mustard,
in playful allusion to the ſº of the ion, with rue, for the
probable upshot, and parsley, which the etymologists tell us, is—like
the papacy itself-only a corruption of “Pater selige,” or Št. Peter,
patron at once of the Vatican and the entertainment. But it was an
artificial garden. The laurels and pot-herbs had no root to them, any
more than DR. MANNING's º for the temporal power; any more
than the Holy Father's trust in Peter's pence, or Catholic powers; any
more than the flowers of speech, which were lavished on the occa-
sion when GENERAL KAUZLER minister of ...'. riate mouth-
iece of the Prince of Peace—proposed the health of the Pope. “The
Kºi..., spoke timidly—in a very low voice—and one could only dis-
tinguish some confused words about France, the EMPEROR, and
continual protection.”
What could have been more appropriate to the occasion ?__Here is,
in a few words, the secret of such health as poor old Pio NoNo can
boast. It all hinges on France, the EMPEROR, and confused words
about “continual protection.” But of all the speeches of the day com-

DERICK CHARLEs,
with reference to the

subscribed for and
presented to them by

respectable, for it consisted principally of proprietors of hotels in the

fare must have been benefited by the late imposing entries of the
victorious Prussian army into the capital, the money they must have
made out of strangers taking apartments, and by letting their windows,
to say ºf of the sale of refreshments and drinks to patriotic
Prussians, I don’t see why their motives in giving a testimonial to the
Crown Prince and his Cousin should be ridiculed or suspected. It’s
all the same whether one looks at the parties the testimonial was meant
for, as Princes or as Generals. Without Princes there would have been
no Royal Family, and without a Royal Family there would have been
no Bism ARck, very likely, and most certainly no annexation, and with-
out annexation there'd have been no triumphal entries, and without
triumphal entries, there'd have been no profits to the hotel proprietors
of Unter den Linden. Qr, looking at the Princes as dº, it comes
to the same thing. Without Generals there'd have been no army;
without an army there’d have been no victories; without victories
there’d have been no popular rejoicings; and without popular rejoicings
# 'd have been no profits to the hotel proprietors of Unter den
inden.
Itake my stand on either principle, and I ask you, Sir, and I ask
you emphatically, if these highly º: º are not the

monial to her on the occasion of their union-treated the deputation
in a most unbecoming—if he wasn't a Prince I should almost say
coarse or even brutal–manner. Not only did he flatly refuse the sword
which one would have thought was bad enough, but he added insult to
injury by saying—“He did not like to receive #. which had been got
up by persons whose chief object was to make themselves talked of, and got
up moreover at the e e of their fellow-citizens.”
Now, I put it to you, Mr. Punch, if this is the sort of thing that is
to be blurted out in the face of a #lºgº deputation, when
they attend to present a testimonial? hy, Sir, what’s to become of
nine-tenths of the testimonials by which parties express their feelings
in this country, if the parties they’re presented to were to take upon
themselyes to impute motives to other parties in this style? A precious
sight of testimonials, you’d have, if none were to be accepted that
were got up º whose chief object was to make, themselves
talked about! hy, bless, you, Sir, I know all about it, having been
§ in the testimonial line, off and on, this thirty years, and,
though I sayit, having got up more costly black silk flºº and tea-
pots with sovereigns in 'em, to ornaments of the church; more silver
services to M.P.'s with a proper sense of what they owed to their con-
stituencies and their country, in course; more portraits to masters of
hounds; more silver cups to disinterested members of vestries for
their exertions in resisting the advocates of a profligate and bloated
expenditure of the rates; more handsome épergnes, to managers for
their exertions in the cause of the drama; and more Shakspearian vases
to actors for their professional sacrifices in elevating the public taste,
than any other man in our line-I mean the Honorary Secretary
business. And I’ve yet to hear of the testimonial where the parties
as get it up didn't like to see, themselves and their subscriptions in
º: and the bigger print the better. Why, Sir, people, to my know-
edge, like to have their betterfeelings properly ventilated; and ain’t the
fact a credit to human nature?. t can be pleasanter to a real dis:
interested, enthusiastic disposition—and naturally it's mostly that kind
expresses themselves in testimonials-than to be able to say to all the
readers of the Times, “Go thou and do likewise.” There’s Scripture
for that, I rather think. Feeling that if the PRINCE OF PRussia's
line were to be generally taken, we shall be bunging up all the gushi
impulses of our common humanity that, now find a chamel in testi-
monials—and I’m proud to say they're always a-running and a-running
freely through that channel in this public-spirited and patriotic
ºši. men of all sorts may go on toiling and molling all
their lives, without any recognition from their fellow-men; and them
that makes it their business to see virtue rewarded, and all the
trouble of receiving the subscriptions and making arrangements for the
advertising, and choosing and settling for the testimonial, and getting
} the dinner; and all the other little matters that falls to the hard lot
of an honorary secretary (which we are proud to do it, and I for one
was never heard to grumble) will be forced to drop our laborious and
ratuitous line of business, that of reducing into testimonials the
É. feelings of human nature.

HoN. Sec.
P.S.. I have often talked to parties about a testimonial to Mr. P.
Couldn’t we meet and square it? My figure is as moderate as any
man's in the market-ten per cent; on the gross amount of the sub-

One is not much surprised to find that it is precisely this kind of
receptacle that has been selected to receive his spat by MR. Hoare, of
Dublin, the principal Irish oyster-grower. The odd thing is, that the
Irish oysters should have shown as national a turn for taking things
by the wrong end as the Irish oyster-grower, and should have attached
themselves ardently and by scores to these fascines or bundles of twigs
which your º or "Ile de Rhé oyster wouldn't so much as look
at. For some time we were puzzled to account for this, but we believe
we have now discovered the reason. The twigs were shillelagh cuttings,
and the oysters natives of Ireland.

CHEERS AT THE CHURCH CONGRESS.
HoLDING forth in the Church Congress at York, the very Reverend
the DEAN or CORK, on the subject of “Dogmatic Teaching from the
Pulpit,” said that:-
“Science discovered facts; but theology accepted revelation and clung to creeds.”
This observation elicited “ loud cheers.” It is not easy to see why.
MR. G. J. HoLyoAKE might make just the same remark to an assemb
of Secularists, and they with equal reason might respond to it §
shouts of hip, hip, hip, hooray!—which, as expressions of assent to a
theological proposition on the #. of a concourse of divines, are new,
and may be thought to sound a little unclerical.
The Dean proceeded :-
“Science allowed them to say that this or that thing would be the truth; but it
would not allow them to say this is the truth; has been the truth, and always will
be the truth (Cheers.) The Church was bound to protest against this phase of the
age, and assert the right of the supernatural over the natural, and that there were
certain truths which were and must be true, although they did not admit of logical
demonstration. This state of mind was further due to the i. and revolutionary
character of modern religious thought. (Hear, hear.)”
Hear, hear, again, is a cry which although eminently parliamentary,
may not be accounted º Apart, however, from that
consideration, it is one with which the foregoing assertions would be
hailed by another Church Congress than that ºft. has been meeting
at York. If DR. NEwMAN or DR. MANNING were to make the same
observations to a Congress of Roman Catholics, their audience would
also cry, if not Amen, hear hear as loud as they could bawl. Indeed
the Pope's last Encyclical contained something very much like the
language above quoted. But who shall decide about dogma when
doctors of theology ºf: And what authority can any ody claim
for dogma who denies that of the original dogmatists. “Hear hear,
indeed. Yes, to be sure,” his Holiness will say, “Hear the Church.
Hear me.” The Protestantijºno Coº further spoke and said:—
“Men had ceased to believe that it was right to burn a man for his religious
opinions; but they were in danger of believing that there was hardly any opinion
worth burning a man for. (Laughter and cheers.)”
The laughter is intelligible. , Perhaps there were present, some con-
sistent thinkers who perceived that if any opinion was worth burning
a man for, it would be right and not wrong therefore, to burn him;
Perhaps also the DEAN of CoRK's hearers included some ºff.
members of the English Church, who thought it absurd as well as
wrong to burn any man for his religious opinions.
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
I HAVE assisted at few more exciting entertainments than The Derby
Day at the Holborn Theatre. “The tip,” MR. SEFTON PARRY might
advertise, “is Flying Scud for any night in the week;” and I dare say
the horse will run some considerable time. The attraction, there, is
undoubtedly the scene on the Epsom Downs, which is most admirably
managed. The Derby winner is not, perhaps, as a general rule, ridden
by its jockey into the very midst of the Aunt Sallies, Punch shows, and
niggers, the very moment after the victory; and by the way, the owners
of racehorses usually confine their betting transactions to the ring. But
an audience, unlike SIR. Boy Le Roche's bird, can't be in more places
than one at once; and therefore is it that the exigences of stage effect
excuse such breaches of custom as mentioned above. The judicious in
the stalls may grieve at the jockey boys and their master performing a
thorough stage-ballet hornpipe; but as gallery and pit applaud, the inci:
dental dance is likely to be retained in the bills, by favour of the gods and
groundlings. . A propos of stalls, the seats are most comfortable, and an
ordinary sized gentſeman can walk from end to end of a row, with
comfort to himself, and, which is a still greater point, without incom-
moding the sitters. -
The first two acts are very good, and the scene, where the reading of
the will occurs, has about it all the comedy tone of London Assurance.
After the Second Act it possesses neither such telling dialogue as
delighted every one in Arrah-na-Pogue, nor is it admirable for its
close construction, as, is The Long Strike. It is not a dramatic suc-
cess, but it is undeniably a theatrical success, and that, I, take it, is
sufficient for the Manager, who has evidently been most liberal in its
production.

A PHYSICIAN ON FUMIGATION.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH, -
THERE is a controversy which has begun in smoke, and will
º end in smoke. I mean, the controversy about Smoking on
ways. The practice of smoking will doubtless go on as before.
Railway Directors had better accept the situation, and provide smoking
carriages exclusively for smokers.
I don't at all º of smoking in moderation. Indeed, I
always smoke a cigar the last thing before going to bed. Of course, if
I am called up in the night I put on a fresh dress. A medical education
accustoms the nose to worse things than tobacco-smoke. However,
I really like the smell of it. But many of my patients don't. . That’s
the worst of travelling in company with smokers... Smelling of smoke,
in vain I tell them I have been the fellow-traveller of smoking men.
They say, “Oh, come Doctor, that won't do,” and imagine that I have
been sotting with medical students. They are simply terrified by the
suggestion that tobacco-smoke is a good disinfectant for a physician
who may have just been visiting a case of small-pox.
Now it is a bore to lose patients by a graveolence derived from other
people's tobacco, and therefore I want smoking carriages, or rather
some non-smoking carriages in which passengers really mustn't smoke.
At the same time I must say there seems something absurd in the
necessity of making arrangements to meet the fact, that the majority
of men are unable to remain, during their waking hours, an hour or
two together comfortably without a cigar or a pipe in their mouths.
They thus keep their nervous systems under the constant influence of
a narcotic. As a medical woman I cannot but consider this practice
injurious. Constant smoking must affect the brain, and, I believe,
exerts a peculiar influence on those parts of it whereby the human
brain exceeds that of brutes. The immediate effect of smoking is ease
of mind. . A pipe or a cigar smothers anxieties, and stifles reflection.
Continual smoking fosters supreme satisfaction with the present. This
ends in a habitual state of ...; serenity. So men get indifferent to
injustice, tolerant of rascality, and acquiescent in cruelty and oppres:
sion." Hence the prevalent cynicism that sneers at all earnestness, and
calls the abhorence of wrong sentimental. I am confident that inor-
dinate smoking tends to stupefy the higher moral affections and intel-
lectual faculties. This, although I am a moderate smoker myself, and
an advocate of smoking carriages, is the firm opinion of
Yours truly, AMY SYDENHAM, M.D.
P.S. The smoking carriages should be for men only. No woman
can want to be always .."; Many men would be glad to be able
to insure themselves against the possibility of a shameful extortion.
A MODEL LOCAL BOARD.
MR. PUNCH hastens to call attention to the spirited and energetic
conduct of the Local Board of Oswestry in regard to a sanatory duty.
He reads in the Oswestry Advertiser that the Local Board resolved to
deal with a pestilent and hideous nuisance, known hy and well de;
serving the name of the Clawdd-du, or Black Ditch. The active and
intelligent Council met, and unanimously agreed that such a place
ought not to exist in the pretty and thriving borough of KING Oswald.
They wasted little time in discussion or experiment, and they did not
permit any jobbing considerations to stand in their Nº. With a
| F. and decision which command all respect, and which should
|be imitated by all other local authorities, they instantly removed the
blot from the map of Oswestry, by re-christening the Black Ditch, and
calling it Market Street. The new name was to be put up immediately.
We hear that though it is not usual to reward a Board for merely
doing its duty, silver medals have been forwarded to all the º
Councillors from the Local Government Act Office in London. e
add (with regret that a generally well conducted contemporary should
forget itself) that the Qsicestry Advertiser is exacting enough to express
a hope that some day the Black Ditch “will disappear in substance as
it has done in name,” a piece of press impertinence to which we find
it difficult to affix the befitting condemnation.
Is it remarkable that. Sheffield logicians try gunpowder arguments
when MR. BRIGHT is always blowing everybody º

I answer “Nºthing.” “I thought so,” he says. “You just come

The coachman can’t make out why the dog didn’t bark. With the
groom he searched the grounds. Everyone goes about searching

a poker in his hand. The footman sits at the top of the servants'
stairs, and, alarms, the entire household, for a second time, by falling
asleep, and tumbling down half-a-dozen steps. He spends the re-
mainder of his night in brown paper, vinegar, and groans; but
heroically at his post, at the bottom of the stairs where he fell, with a
poker. Everyone seems to have got a poker.

EAR SIR,--I am sure that you
will be glad to hear from me,

tain that I feel very kindly
towards you, and belief in the
good feeling of others is the
way to create it. Do not think
again of the outrageous and
unkind letter you sent, hinting
that I had been away more
than twice as long as I had
romised to be. I have quite
orgiven it, and have shown
you that I would take no
notice of a friend's temporary
- forgetfulness of propriety.
Rather than add to your self-
... reproaches, I would stay here
another fortnight.
For it is very pleasant.
The season, has long been
over. All the Parisian idiots
- - and idiotesses, who used to
change their dresses three times a day, have departed, and there are
few visitors here except some pleasant %. who do not dress
three times a day, but in revenge wash at least once, to the astonish-
ment of the servants, accustomed to French habits...Do not you set
this down as a bit of old-fashioned Anglican prejudice. I am very
fond of the Frenchman. I like his readiness to be amused, for ever
so long, with the slightest trifle. I like the solemn and earnest care
which he bestows on his pretty gloves. I like his courteousness of
manner, when nothing has annoyed him. . But he does not wash,
Send out a commission to inquire into the subject—those light-hearted
Commissioners on Election Corruption would be just the men, as the
French love small and weak jokes. Their report would be in the lan-
É. used by Miss EDGEworth's bear, who put his head in at the
arber's window and cried “No Soap !”
Fº knows Dieppe, of course, and therefore, though I for one
have never been here before, I scorn to describe it, as otherwise I
could do elegantly, for I am known to have much graphic power.
There are some good hotels. I am at that of Les Bains, to which I
resorted because, although, my Parisian accent is perfect, it is not
appreciated at Dieppe, which is a provincial town. therefore prefer
to converse with an English host. But I think that the French waiter
(he is called a garçon in French) partly understands me, with the aid
of my pantomime, when I ask for the mustard. The hotel is very
comfortable and the charges are reasonable, and if you see any reason
why I should not say this in favour of MR. MoRGAN, you may excise
the paragraph, and put in some stupid joke about Fata Morgana.
It was near here that HENRY THE FourTH, of France, fought, the
battle of Ivory. The memory of the victory is still preserved, for there
is no town so celebrated for its ivory work. Wishing for a relic, which
should be a representative type of the French mind, I have bought an
ivory mousetrap to catch flies in.
I fear that there may be one or two persons in Paris who are not
strictly honest. My reason for saying this is, that a lady whom I have
met, purchased in that metropolis, for the sum of fifty francs, a kitten

. It is pleasing to see the doctrine of Equality carried out so well as it
is in France. oman is regarded not only as equal to man, but as
equal to man's work. I was smoking for an hour on the east Cliff near
the coastguard's station, and watching the women toiling on the beach
below. It was work to which, in our unenlightened country, we
should put only the strongest sort of *g, Each woman had to take
along walk with a basket on her back. She came to a heap of stones.
She filled the basket, till she could hardly lift it to her back, but, she
did. Then she toiled back again, up a steep hill of shingle, up a plank
at a severe gradient, and º º until she came to the place for
unloading. She emptied the basket, and instantly, set out to repeat
the journey. It was awful work. When ſhad looked at it for some
time, my own back began to ache, and I moved away, as one should
never distress oneself. The sight did not distress a lot of stalwart men
who sat smoking their pipes near the toiling creatures. I regret that
my own weakness of nature unfitted me for longer observation of these
proofs of the civilisation of the French. .
The superior classes, however, are ..º.º. Just before
the Parisians departed, I had an illustration of this. Two French gen-
tlemen, staying at the hotel, used. I observed, to engage every morning
in earnest conversation, and by their gestures I saw that they were
i.; some process, perhaps of chemistry. After four or five
days, each produced a small paper, in which was a powder, and they
eagerly compared their powders, with a profusion of debate. Being
myself, as you know, one of the most intelligent, attendants at the
lectures in Albemarle Street, I was interested, and I got a friend, who
knew the gentlemen, to inquire what the philosophical investigation
referred to, in order that I might report to DR. FARADAY., . My friend
informed me that the philosophers could not agree,as to which powder
made a man's complexion loºk the prettier, after shaving, -
The amusements of the refined classes in France are also of a high
order of elegance and intellectuality. I hoped that the Diva THERESA
would come here, for I anticipated a great treat from the singing of a
lady who is so great a favourite at Court, and with the salons. She
will not come, however, but I have received a copy of one of her latest
songs. It is sung in the character of a provincial wet-nurse, who has
a lucrative engagement in Paris, but who laments her home. I regret
that the differences of English and French taste are so marked that if
I should translate for you any verse in this Court song, and you should
print it, no subsequent number of your publication would ever enter
all English household. Something else certainly divides the French
and English besides the sea. - - - -
I s remain here a little longer, chiefly in order to convince you
that I have entirely forgotten your unkindness. This country, as you
are aware, is Catholic, but Protestants are tolerated, and I am º
to say that º countrymen here show great respect for the Sunday, for
on that day they always wear hats instead of wide-awakes. There are
excellent English clergymen here. It was not always so, for a horse-
racing friend remarked at the table d'hôte, touching a minister who was
here some years ago, “He could not preach an ounce.” -- -
Dear Sir, if the weather keeps fine I shall stay here, because it is so
p. and if it gets bad, I shall not leave here, because I cannot
ear a rough sea. But I shall be very happy to hear from you-letters
go round by Paris, perhaps, Marseilles and Algiers—therefore my
return and reply are somewhat uncertain.

AFTER all, the aggrandisement of Prussia is the extension of a con-
stitutional monarchy—is it not? The States recently annexed to the
Prussian Kingdom will all share in the enjoyment of that political and
personal freedom which is the common blessing of KING WILLIAM's
subjects. As witness the subjoined telegram from Copenhagen :-
“BARon Schre L-PLEssex, the Prussian governor of Schleswig, has prohibited the
raising of subscriptions by the Danish inhabitants for the purchase of a wedding
gift for the PRINcess DAGMAR."
“Freedom, freedom, hey-day freedom!... the KING OF PRUssia's
new Danish subjects may exclaim with Caliban. Perhaps there is as
little love lost between the Danes of Schleswig and their prosperous
master as there was between Caliban and Prospero.

FANGs filed, and talons blunted, his once wide wings clipped low,
The flion of St. Mark hath been the wonder of a show. . . .
For years on years the crowds have flocked, to see him in his cage.
To note his beauty, and his strength, his weariness and rage.
The light of ancient majesty in the sunk eye smouldered dim :
Dreams of old deeds seemed weak to nerve each huge but wasted limb :
As hot with hunger of his heart, in that ignoble show,
The close-caged #. of St. Mark, paced, ever, to and fro.
Now and anon the sunk eye lit, the great throat gave a sound,
A growl of warning thunder, that scared the gazers round:
The huge limbs thrilled, the broad i. shook—then all was as before–
We saw the Lion of St. Mark pacing his narrow floor.
Pacing, as who must pace till death—but lo, what now we see,
The Lion of St. Mark is loose, his gaunt limbs stretching free—
Trying with wonder and delight the stiff wings, once so wide,
Free and agaze, not pacing his cage from side to side'
Free and agaze, in ecstasy, across the green lagune,

A MODEL BISHOP AT YORK.
MY DEAR PUNCH,
OH, how happy you must be to be able to do what you like
and go where you please! You might, had you chosen, have attended
the Church Congress at York, you might have visited the “Eccle:
siastical Art Exhibition” in that city, and there you might have feasted
your eyes on an object, which, from the account of it given by a love of
a fashionable reporter, must be º charming. It is the figure of
a Bishop in full vestments, of which the following description when I
read it, made me ready to dance with ecstasy:—
“Sandals of purple velvet, banded with cloth of gold, jewelled; cassock of purple
silk, trained; rochet of fine lawn, edged with Irish point lace; alb and girdle of fine
linen; tunicle of blue silk, banded and fringed with silver; dalmatic of gold coloured
silk, banded and fringed with gold; mitre of cloth of gold, embroidered with passion
flowers; gloves of purple silk embroidered with gold; ring, a sapphire surrounded
. º ; pastoral staff of ivory and ebony, set with topaz, emeralds, and
carbuncles.”
Oh, how sweetly pretty! How nice it would be if live Bishops were
to appear in such lovely dresses as the one worn }{ the model prelate
in the York Ecclesiastical Art Exhibition | Then they would be
models indeed, and particularly for the toilettes of us girls. If Papa
would have taken me to the ğ. Congress, it would have been a
real treat to feast my eyes on the pretty Bishop in effigy, only I should
have envied it so ! It is tantalising enough to look at an elegantly
attired dummy in the window of a dressmaker's º but the episcopal
one at York must have inspired a still more ardent longing. The dear
Ritualists, who get up these things, are taking the right way to win
the female heart; and my stupid old uncle may say if he likes that
clerical purposes are not likely to be promoted by lay figures.
Believe me, dearest Punch, ever yours, affectionately,
FANNY.
P.S. Why don’t they publish Ecclesiastical Fashions for October,
and so on, every month in Le Follet?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CASE (FOR THE OPINION OF MR. PUNCH).
CASE.
BEFORE the Legislature gives its sanction to any Railway, Bill
involving the construction of New Works, it requires that such Bill
shall enact :—
1. The amount of the Share Capital to be subscribed.
2. That the whole of this Share Capital has been subscribed for, and
that one-half of the amount has been *. up, and that a Justice of
the Peace (not interested) has certified to the above state of things,
before any of their borrowing powers can be exercised by the Company.
3. No Railway Act confers any borrowing powers beyond one-third
of the declared amount of the Share Capital of the Company.
The object of these enactments is evident.
No issue of debentures being legal, except against a share capital
of three times the amount, one-half actually paid and certified,
on a statutory declaration, to be so paid § a Justice of the
Peace, and the other half at call, debenture-holders are secured
against loss by ample and bond ſide security.
. 4. The London, Cheatem and Clover Railway (in April, 1864) bein
in want of money for their Eastern Extension, entered into an agreemen
with an eminent firm of Contractors, SLEEkow E, GETTs, & WAMPEM,
of Great Lupus Street, Westminster.
5. Under this agreement, the Company gave a receipt to the Con-
tractors in the terms and form annexed:-
(Copy) LONDON, CHEATHEM and CLOWER RAILWAY.
Secretary's Office, Queer Street, Pimlico, S.W.
April 1, 1864.
Received of Messrs. Sleekowe, Getts, & Co., the sum of Four Hundred and
Twenty-nine Thousand Seven Hundred Pounds for Deposit, and in anticipation of
Calls on 85,000 Metropolitan Extension (Eastern Section) “A–Z” Shares.
#2429,700. (Signed) W. E. STRAwMAN, Secretary.
. 6; The Contractors, at the same date, gave a receipt to the Company
in these terms:–
(Copy) 9, Great Lupus Street, Westminster, S.W.,
April 1, 1864.
METROPOLITAN ExtENSION (*. SECTION).
Received of the London, Cheatem and Clover Railway Company the sum
of Four Hundred and Twenty-nine Thousand Seven Hundred Pounds in respect of
our Contract for the Construction of the above-named Section.
Per pro. SLEEkows, GETTs, AND WAMPEM,
£429,700. ABRAHAM OiLY.
7. These receipts of the Contractors to the Company, and the Com-
É. to the Contractors, were then entered as payments on the
ompany’s books.
8. The declaration required by statute, of the fact of these pay-
ments, was then made before a Justice of the Peace, who duly issued
his certificate, and thereupon the full amount of debentures authorised
by the statute (£356,300) were issued, and are still outstanding.
9. Qur client, MR. SAP GREEN, holds £40,000 of these debentures,
on which a year's interest is in arrear, and which the Company are
bound to redeem at two months' notice.
10, The Company is now in Ghancery and insolvent; and is equally
unable to redeem the principal or to pay up the interest on these
debentures.
ll. On an official investigation into the affairs of the Company, it
appears that both the receipts above given were illusory.
12. No such payment on account of works was ever made by the
Company to the Contractors. No such payment on account of shares
was ever made by the Contractor to the º and in consequence
our unfortunate client is left without any available security for his
advances.
You are requested to advise on the above facts,
OPINION.
1. Whether a criminal º: 1. I am of opinion that a cri-
can be sustained against either the minal charge can be sustained on
representatives of the Company, the facts as submitted. I am at a
or the Contractors. loss to distinguish the case from
the many, well-known, reported
cases, in which criminal proceed-
ings have been taken successfull
against persons, obtaining ad-
vances on fictitious title-deeds,
dock-warrants, or deposits fraud-
ulently represented to be of value,
the depositor knowing them to be
worthless. See, inter alia, Smug's
Case (2 W.& H.180) in which SMUg
obtained an advance of £10,000
on certain stones, ºf them
to be Indian diamonds of the first
9. Whether, if such charge can
be supported, proceedings should
be i. against both the Com-
pany and the Contractors; or one
of them, and if against one only,
against which.
3. How the indictment should
be framed : Whether for conspi-
racy to defraud, or for obtainin
water, they being proved to be, to
his knowledge at the time, certain
imitations of diamonds, of little or
gºvalue, commonly called “Bristol
Stones.” He was thereupon found
ty of obtaining money on
alse pretences and sentenced, MR.
JUSTICE GARRow observing that
“suchE. s are calculated
to undermine confidence in
commercial dealings between man
and man, and that they seemed to
him of a higher degree of turpi-
tude than petty º burglary,
Ori. of the coarser forms of cri-
minal inroad upon property.” See
also Cole & Windle's Case (4 Crimi-
nal Reports, p. 674.)
.2. I am of Qpinion that an in-
dictment would lie against either
the Company, or the Contractors,
singly, or against both jointly.
3. If the indictment be laid
ainst both jointly, I am of opinion
that it should be for conspiracy to
money on false pretences, or
- - obtain money on false Fº:
neither, how otherwise. l
If it be laid against either Com-
pany or Contractor singly, I am
of opinion it should be for obtain.
ing money on false pretences.
4. In advising generally on the
case I think it would be well that
the prosecution should bearin mind
that the Conspiracy, or the False
Pretences, in this case having for
object the raising of enormous sums
of money, great difficulty is likely
to be experienced in procuring a
conviction; and that, it must not
be supposed that either the evi:
dence, or the reasoning, that would
support an ordinary indictment of
the § in a Criminal Court will
satisfy a jury where the sum raised
amounts to nearly fifteen millions,
and where the accused are such
eminently respectable persons.
4. You are requested to advise
generally on the case.
It is not in accordance with my experience that a jury can be readily
brought to regard the fraudulent operator who works for millions in the
same light as the petty offender who cheats for pence or pounds.
Finance has its own º: such transactions as those s in
this case may be within its limits. I do not think, however, that this
could be pleaded in bar of an indictment. It is true that the Çourt
will recognise the customs of trade in interpreting contracts; but I
am not aware of any case in which such custom has been held to jº.
an utterly false representation of the value of a security, proved to be
made with knowledge, on the strength of which large sums have been
advanced; particularly where the representation is one required by
statute, and supported by the certificate of a Justice of the Peace.
I observe no question is submitted as to the legal effect of makin
the statutory jº falsely. By many statutes the making of suc
declarations falsely is made punishable as perjury, though they are not
on oath. This point should be considered.
Altogether, I think this eminently a case for raising the question
whether there is such a crime known to English law as raising mone
on false pretences, where the money raised amounts to millions...
may also do much to fix the limit (as yet undetermined) at which
“financing” ends and “swindling” begins. 39852&Cº.

A BRADFORD BLUNDERER.
Nemo bis retari, and so forth, saith a law maxim; and as Mr.
Punch is, morally sure that the unhappy Editor of the Bradford Ob-
server will ere this have received from MR. BRIGHT, per post, a private
flagellation, in return for the scribe's abject attentions, ſº Punch will
merely notice, not for the Editor's sake, but Yorkshire's, a slander
which the Observer has published in reference to Mr. P.'s last beautiful
and suggestive Cartoon....The Bradford writer is a “numb hand; ”
and we imagine that he will speedily discover that the canny Yorkshire-
men are not to be *...* by a scribbler who is too lazy to turn to
the file of a journal which he wishes to vilify. He had charged Mr.
Punch with having caricatured the late MR. Cobden, the last time he
was mentioned in Punch. , Yorkshiremen are accustomed to straight-
forward language, and we leave them to apply the right name to the
Editor of the Observer, when they have been reminded that, about two
months before MR. Čognºs's death, he was referred to as a “true
statesman,” and a kindly hope was added that he would not support
certain Liverpool financiers. He was never alluded to again in Punch,
during his life, but tributes both in verse and prose appeared when the
nation was mourning him; and, if Mr. Punch divulged confidences, he
could show that those tributes were welcome where such servility as
that of the Bradford scribe must have inspired disgust. So much for
the Bradford Blunderer. He may settle with MR. BRIGHT for having
contended that, because MR. Coºden was a great and good man, MR.
*::::: ought not to have been depicted in the admirable Cartoon in
question.

A MAN, calling himself a gentleman, was lately convicted, on his
own confession, of taking up his residence.
DON'T CALL BAD NAMES.
MR. PUNCH has always pleasure in º little pleasures which
promote the harmless happiness of society. It is delightful to him to
see a round—or oval table of grown-up and bearded gentlemen sniffing
at Pharaoh's Serpents, or evincing *; at Fairy Bubbles. But a
certain good taste should dominate our delights. We certainly dis-
approve of the vulgarity which has given to the last new #.
name which should not be made a household word. Certain little balls,

THE NEW PRIMER.
For the use of those who teach the young idea how to shoot, there
has very lately been invented a new Primer. We have not yet had
the leisure and the pleasure to examine this new weapon of instruction
carefully, but we §. that, although it may be found to miss fire
here and there, upon the whole it pretty fairly contrives to hit the mark.
Clearly, it is better for the noble army of our martyrs—we mean to
say our schoolmasters; the two words are synonymous-that they
should all be furnished with one uniform weapon o i.º. than
have half a hundred to pick from and Fº them. The new Primer
on the whole is the best that is in use, and, although some of our great
guns may differ. in d to it, we believe it will be found a very
serviceable jāj:

THE WOMAN IN WIGHT.
THE quiet of Ventnor has been disturbed by an incident which might
have been attended with circumstances more or less serious, but, for:
tunately, was accompanied by nothing of the kind. It is thus recorded
In a prºgraph apparently comprising a week's news from the Isle of
Wight:—
“WFNTNOR. Agent, MEssRs. KNIGHT & Son.
“AccIDFNT.—Asalady was coming down from the railway station into Grove Road,
last week, she trod upon a stone which lay in the road, and her foot taking a rather
peculiar turn, she fell to the ground without, happily, receiving any severe injury."
The sensational announcement above quoted from the Hampshire
Telegraph, may at first, seem to indicate that in the Isle of Wight
there has not been much stirring lately, but—as a popular comedian
used to say—stagnation, ...This idea arises from the want of a due
appreciation of the sensibility of Isle of Wight people. At any rate,
the inhabitants of Ventnor have hearts that can be affected by a
sister's fall, even when not only are no bones broken by it, but even
so much as a bruise does not appear to have been sustained. But who
was the sufferer of that alarming accident f we would ask—if only she
had suffered anything. Who was the heroine of the startling occur-
rence, related in the foregoing paragraph, which frightened the Isle of
Wight from its Pºiº e know not. There are perhaps reasons
sº we should never know....Let her remain unnamed—a mystery.
Suffice it to speak of her as “The Woman in Wight.”
FUNCTIONAL INACTION
THE late Bishop BLOMFIELD was thought to have said a good
thing when, having been asked what an Archdeacon did, he replied
that an Archdeacon “performed Archidiaconal functions.”. Some
people may be inclined to consider that, by way of definition, it might
with equal and corresponding propriety be said, that a Bishop performs
Episcopal functions. But, with regard to our present Bishops, this
would be saying a very great deal more than the truth. Clergymen of
the Established Church, in Anglican churches, are acting Popery under
their Bishops' noses. Those Bishops take no steps to banish and drive
the strange doctrine and practices away. It is far too much to say of
such Bishops that Episcopal functions are performed by them. On the
contrary, the fact, as touching a Prelate of the Church of En land
would just now be more exactly expressed by the statement that a
Bishop does not perform Episcopal functions.
A CARD TO CLERGYMEN.

HAPPY THOUGHTS.
(The morning after. At Furze.)
HERE is no one up : except
the servants. FRASER is in
the wine-cellar, as usual,
some samples having just
arrived from town, and two
cases. Miss FRIDolin Ecalls,
while I am at work on
Typical Developments. I can
see her arrive, from my room.
She is talking to the foot-
man, who, from his rubbing
his left shoulder very often,
is evidently telling her about
his º fallen down-
stairs, and last night's affair
generally.
Happy Thought.—To let
her see me at my window.
I wonder if she did see
me. I ought to have looked
at her. She’s * in. I

saying, “Yes, MRs. FRASER, I’ll get them for you.” She passes my
door, and descends the staircase. Shall I? I will. Typical Develop-
ments can wait.
Happy Thought.—Brush my hair, and settle my tie.
We meet, in the hall. She is, going to the hothouse, to get some
grapes for “poor MRs. FRASER.” I say, “I’m going in that direction,
myself,” and then look at her with a smile intended to be full of
meaning. On repeating, afterwards, the same smile to myself in the
looking-glass, the meaning doesn't appear sufficiently, distinct and
ºne. But then it is difficult to look tenderly at oneself in a looking-
glass.
Happy Thought.—Try the effect in the glass, before, not afterwards,
another time.
W. are walking along the gravel-path, about two feet apart from one
allotiller.
She is humming a tune. I feel that all my conversational powers
have entirely, deserted me. She says, “I’m sure it’s boring you very
much to walk with me. I really can go alone, I assure you.” I feel
taken aback by the remark; somehow, with all my knowledge of
human nature, it isn't what I had expected her to say. I should like
to come out with something now which would clinch matters. 1
reply, “Oh no, I'm not bored,” which, I feel, implies that I am only
saying so out of politeness. After this, it seems that my power of
speech has entirely deserted me... If I talked at all, I should like it to be
on very serious subjects. It strikes me that if there was a third person
here, I could be brilliant. We enter another path. Miss FRIDoline
remarks, laughingly, that I don't talk. Again I have no answer ready.
I can’t make out where my answers have gone to. I am sure she
knows what my feelings are towards her, and she oughtn't to laugh.
I'm afraid, after all, she is frivolous. I ask her “What we shall talk
about?” She says, “Oh, you must start a subject.” Something, I
don't know what, suggests, as a subject, “Beetles.” I can't put it
down as a }} thought.
#. Thought.—The art of talking to anyone with whom you are
secretly in love, is included in the power of making repartees.
She is evidently getting tired of me. . She wants to know...if I
haven't any stories to tell her. No, I haven’t. “Dear me!” she
returns, “I thought you would be such an amusing companion. I
thought you'd have a fund of anecdotes.” So I have : somewhere. I
defend myself by saying, “I didn't come out to tell anecdotes,” I am
obliged to laugh after this speech, as I am conscious of its having a
certain amount of surliness in its tone. “Didn't you?” is her reply.
“You don't expect we to do it.” I feel I am becoming cross: I tell her
that “I don't want any one to do it.” A little more, and we shall
quarrel. She suggests, “Well, you can sing me a comic song, then?
I’m sure you must know numbers of songs.” This is an allusion to
“The Little Pig Squeaked.” I don't like it. The idea of walking about
with the girl whom you secretly love, and doing nothing but sing comic
songs to her! I brood over this, and am silent... I make up my min
to lead up to the subject nearest my heart, on the next ºpportunity.
We turn up another gravel path. ... She observes that she’s “afraid I’m
not well.” Is this an opportunity? No: I’ll wait for a better., I
tell her that I’m not very well this morning, in order to excite her
compassion. “Then,” she says, “don’t fatigue yourself to walk with
me.” The time has come. ... I pump up my voice, with difficulty
through a very hot throat. When it does come out, it sounds as if I d
been eating a pound of nuts, with the husks on, and was talking under
a blanket. P. “I can't feel fatigued,” here I clear my throat,
but am still under the blanket, “while walking with you.” And I clear
my throat again.
Happy Thought.—Not to clear your throat in the middle of a speech.
Ineffective. - -
She appºintly hasn't heard my observation, as she remarks, imme-
diately, “What a beautiful place this is!” I answer, coming a little
way out of the blanket, but hotter than ever, “You didn't hear what
I said P’” She asks, “What, just now ** – I answer, “Yes.” Her
reply is, “that she did hear it: but why?” I don't know “Why.”
Happy Thought—Always have some fixed attitude for one's hands.
To º: them looks careless when you’re talking to some one you
really Ilke. -
I try to explain “why.” . I say, pointedly, with my wide-awake
well shading my eyes, “I don't think you understand me.” I am
getting to the point. She returns, that “she didn't know there was
anything particular to understand.” Not seeing my way to an explana-
tion, I say, “Oh!” in tone of disappointment. She suggests that we
had better make haste to get to the grape-house, as poor MRs. FRASER
is waiting. I say nothing, but, quicken my pace º She
commences another topic. “What a very nice person, MRS, FRASER
is 1* Not caring to taſk about MRs. FRASER, I feel inclined to depre-
ciate her. I say, sourly, “‘Nice!” I hate that phrase.” Well, then,
Miss FRIDoline will substitute “so agreeable and kind, and so lively;”
adding, “I like lively people.” I am aware this is a cut at me.
Feeling hurt, I can't help saying, “I’m afraid I’m not lively.” She
returns, “No, you do not seem very lively this morning.”
º Thought.—Never give anybody an opening to make a cutting
remark.
“One cannot always be lively,” I answer, bitterly, “and playin the
fool. Women, I suppose, are fond of that sort of thing.” “Thank
you,” says Miss. SYMPERSON, “I didn't know I was fond of playing
the fool.” “I didn't say that,” I explain. “I give you credit, Miss
FRudol, NE, for appreciating thoughts of a more serious charactºr.”
I should like to talk to her about my Typical Developments. While
I am thinking how I shall begin, she asks me, “Are you generally
so dull ?” I see the º I. answer, “No, not always;
but—” (here I made the plunge) “with you f can't help it.” . She
interrupts me, “Oh, then, with anyone else you’d be lively and cheer-
ful ? That’s a nice compliment.”
Happy Thought.—Never come out without a pocket-handkerchief.
When you’re talking with . you really care about, it's a very
difficult thing to use a pocket-handkerchief with anything like grace.
You can't say, “I love you!” with your nose hidden. I find it; but
wait for an opportunity. If we come to a narrow path, where I can
walk behind her, I’ll use it then.
We turn a corner, and come suddenly upon the children. “Dear
little things!” cries Miss FRID9LINE. She takes the baby from the nurse.
I look on, morosely. The º boy is there making faces at me. I
think I could strangle them all. Miss FRIDOLINE shows me the baby,
and asks me if it isn't a pretty little darling * I smile on it, and say,
“Charming !”
Happy Thought.—Always take care what one says of children, before
the nurses. They may tell MRs. FRASER. Qne of the children, a
sharp little girl, who ranks between the ugly boy and his younger
brother, begs to be allowed to walk with “FRIDDY.” . Nurse says,
“She’ll be a nuisance to Miss FRIDOLINE,” who replies, “Oh, no-not
at all; do let her come; I’ll take care of her.” I agree with the
nurse, but keep it to myself, and say, gratuitously, “I always get on
well with children.” The child says, “Come on, FRIDDY.” How I
should like to call her “FRIDDY!” Away we walk towards the hot-
house—she, I, and the sharp little girl. The sharp little i. begins
yº She says to FRIDOLINE, “I º FRIDDY, we don't want
in with us, do we ?” meaning me. I shou dike to box her ears....I
say, “Oh, yes, you do, though,” and smile. She continues, “Oh,
you’re a great stupid, you are ; we don’t want you.”. Miss FRIDOLINE
laughs. f'. too; such a laugh? I tell the child, hoping to stop
her sharpness, “You mustn't be rude.” Whereupon she cries out,
“You’re Mister Pigsque AKER, you are; that’s what we all call you,
MISTER PIGsquEAKER!” Miss FRIDolin E is º: the child is
encouraged, and goes on, crying out, “Wee, wee, wee, MistER PIGGY.

MR. PUNCH TO SIR MORTON PETO.
My DEAR SIR MoRTON, - -
THERE is an integrity like the diamond. There is also an in-
º like the Bristol stone. The one is pure, transparent, lustrous:
it has no flaw, and it defies .# The other looks like the same
ºn." it isn’t. You may polish it up, flash it in the light, set it
off with the arts of foil-backing, puff it, praise it, preach over it,
maunder over it, but you can't turn a Bristol stone into a diamond–
“nohow you can fix it.” You have been trying your best—and very
good your best is—to accomplish the transformation. You have put
yourself on a jury of your supporters, and they have not acquitted you
exactly, but—thanked you for }". explanation. I haven't an idea
what their thanks may be worth under the circumstances. One has
heard the phrase “thank you for nothing.” Your supporters, who
crowded St. Martin's Hall, Broadmead, had that much, at all events,
to thank you for. Your explanations, my dear SIR MoRTON, come
precisely to nothing.
You have learnt, among ſº other chapel experiences, the great
virtue of “ º and 'splaining”, in the abstract, without
reference to the quality of the exposition or explanation. That
virtue was never more apparent than at the Broadmead meeting. It
even, projected its blessed influence in advance, and seems to have
satisfied your congregation, that all was satisfactorily “’splained”—
tº: before the “’splaining” began. I read in the report of the meeting
“On SIR Morton entering the room he was received with a burst of applause.
The company rose en masse, and gave vent to their feelings by waving their hats and
handkerchiefs, and vociferously cheering for a considerable time.”
Some crotchety peºple may think that the reception indicates what
is vulgarly called a packed” meeting. I recommend you to treat
the insinuation with silent contempt... If I were you, I would certainly
not stoop to “’splain” the enthusiastic demonstration of your Broad.
mead audience before you even opened your mouth. -
I have read your explanation, and, like your Bristol friends, am
quite ready to thank you for it. But having given thanks for what I
have received, like Oliver Twist, I have the audacity still to feel
hungry, and to ask for more. I appeal to you, ". dear SIR MoRTON,
in your own name—“PETo”—I seek—I seek a leetle more explana-
tion. In fact, I want an explanation of your explanation: what at
Cambridge would be called an explanation squared—to the facts... I
am very sorry for my stupidity. } grieve that I can't feel satisfied
with what was so satisfactory to the Broadmeadians. I would if I
as she's only got this one idea of fun, goes ºn in a could, but I can't. And, therefore, I am compelled, with man
apologies, to put you through a second course of “’spounding an
splaining.”
But before I begin, it is best that we should understand each other—
that you should know what I want to have “’splaned.”
This is the more necessary, because I see that, clear-headed as you
are, you seem to be under a misapprehension on this point.
“It was impossible,” you remarked,
“For anyone who had read the report dispassionately to come to any other con-
clusion but that the firm of PETo & CoMPANY had been guilty of selfish conduct, and
had taken advantage, in an improper way, of the railway."
You may make your mind perfectly easy on that Woint, my dear SIR
MoRTON., No one, I can assure you, ever dreamed of accusing you of
having taken lºgº. advantage of the London, Chatham an E.
any more than of accusing the London, Chatham and Dover of having
taken improper advantage of you. The public is quite satisfied that,
as far as you and the Cºy go, it is a case of “six to one, and half-
a-dozen to the other.” What I have heard both you and the Company
accused of, is of “taking advantage, in an improper way,” of the public,
º º of the unfortunate London, Chatham and Dover debenture-
Olders.
; I must ask you to direct your 'spounding and 'splaining to this
polnt.
And, first, you say, when you were called in on December 17, 1863,
to assist the Directors with your valuable financial advice and counsel
you found a million and a quarter of Lloyd's Bonds outstanding, an
taking precedence of all Debentures. And thereupon you—
“Gave them the best advice that you possibly could, and it was this—that unless
the whole of these Lloyd's Bonds were taken up and paid off it was impossible for
them to go into the market as honest men to borrow money, because the debenture-
holders were not able to know the position that they were in.”
And then, instead of the Lloyd's Bonds, you advised the Company to
issue £1,500,000 of ordinary Stock, and to raise £500,000 of Debentures
on that. And the Company did issue the Stock, but the public did
not come forward to buy it, so the Company handed it over to you, and
you never paid a º on it, but took it into the market and raised
money on it, and gallantly, redeemed the Lloyd's Bonds—and
earned, or ought to have earned, the gratitude of the Company.
Will you |. explain, SIR MoRTON, whether the holders of the
£500,000 Debentures issued against the £1,500,000 Stock, which }.
had used to redeem the j. Bonds, and of which not a share had
been bond ſide subscribed for, “were able to know the position they
were in P’’ -
Will you please explain, also, where lay the difference, in real value,
between the £1,500,000 unsubscribed stock, deposited by you, and the
million and a quarter of Lloyd's Bonds which you withdrew with it?
I can see one difference, and it is this: that on the Lloyd's Bonds the
$.". could not issue any Debentures, whereas on the unsubscribed
Stock, in your hands, they could issue Debentures for half a million, in
illusory—it would be offensive between friends to use such a word as
“fraudulent”—compliance with the law? -
Next, I should be extremely obliged if you would explain, whether
when you gave the Company a receipt for £429,500 which you ha
never received, for works you had never done, and the Company gave
}. a receipt for £429,500 which you had never paid, for shares which
ad never been really taken up, and when, on the strength of that
exchange of dummy receipts, the Company issued £350,000 Deben-
tures, on a Justices’ certificate that three times that amount of shares
had been subscribed for, you considered that the people who took
these Debentures “were able to know the position º were in P”
I see you say that the same sort of thing was done by MR. CRAMPTON
in making the line from Sevenoaks to Maidstone; and that you had
the advice of MR. NEWMAN, a solicitor, of the firm of FREshPIELD,
NEWMAN & Co., for all you did.
MR. FRESHFIELD, MR.NEwMAN's partner, denies this point-blank.
Don't you think it might be advisable that you should explain the
contradiction ?, May I suggest also that you should explain how two
wrongs can make a right: and how right and wrong, truth and false-
hood, 'can change their natures as well as their names under the
advice of a solicitor. I want you to explain—in short, I want you to
EXPLAIN YOUR EXPLANATION.—as I said ſº I find I can’t say
it better. En attendant, I remain, dear SIR MoRTON, .

ExPERIMENTs have recently been made with “chilled projectiles,”
which have proved them to be prodigiously destructive. Of old, when it
happened that an enemy hove in sight the order to the gunners was to

command; and we shall not hear so much about the heat of an engage-
ment, when the victory is won by chilled projectiles and cold steel.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ARTEMUS WARD
MR. Pu Nch, My DEAR SIR,
You didn't get a instructiv article from §." last week on
account of my nervus sistin havin underwent a drefile shock. I got
caught in a brief shine of sun, and it utterly upsot me. , I was walkin
in Regent Street one day last week, enjoyin your rich black fog and
bracing rains, when all at once the Sun bust out and actooally shone
for nearly half an hour steady. I acted promptly. I called a cab and
told the driver to run his hoss at a friteful rate of speed to my lodgins,
but it wasn’t of no avale. I had orful cramps, my
IN LONDON.
º left me
and my P. went down to 10 degrees below zero. But by careful
nussin I shall no doubt recover speedy, if the present sparklin and
exileratin weather continners.
º of the foregoin is sarcasum.
t’s a sing lar ſack, but I never sot eyes on your excellent British
Mooseum till the other º I’ve sent a great many peple there, as
also to your genial Tower of London, however. It happend thusly:
When one of my excellent countrymen jest arrived in London would
come and see me and display a inclination to cling to me too !".
thus showin a respect for me which I feel I do not deserve, I would
sugjest a visit to the Mooseum and Tower. The Mooseum would
ockepy him a day at leest, and the Tower another. Thus I’ve derived
considerble peace and comfort from them noble edifisses, and i hope
they will long continner to grace your metroplis. There's my fren
Col. LARKINS, from Wisconsin, who I regret to say understands the
Jamaica question, and wants to talk with me about it; I sent him to
the Tower four days ago, and he hasn't got throogh with it yit. He
likes it very much, an he writes me that he cºni never thank me
sufficient for directin him to so interestin a bildin. I writ him not to
mention it. The Col. says it is fortnit we live in a intellectooal age
which wouldn't countenance such infamus things as occurd in this
Tower. I’m aware that it is fashin’ble to compliment this age, but I
ain't so clear that the Col. is altogether right. This is a very º;
able age, but it's pretty easily riled; and considerin upon how slight
a provycation we who live in it go to cuttin each other's throats, it
may perhaps be doubted whether our intellecks is so much massiver
than our ancestors' intellecks was, after all.
I allus ride outside with the cabman. I am of humble parentage,
but I have (if you will permit me to say so) the spirit of the eagle,
which chaſes when shut up in a four-wheeler, and | feel much eagler
when I'm in the open air. So on the mornin on which I went to the
Mooseum I lit a pipe, and callin a cab, I told the driver to take me
there as quick as his Arabian charger could go. The driver was under
the inflooence of beer, and narrerly escaped runnin over a aged female
in the match trade, whereupon I remonstratid with him. I said, “That
Qor old woman may be the only mother of a young man like you.”
!hen throwing considerable pathos into my voice, I said, “You have
a mother ?” -
He said, “You lie!” I got down and called another cab, but said
nothin to this driver about his parents.
. The British Mooseum is a magnifcent free show for the people. It
is kept open for the benefit of all. -
The humble costymonger, who traverses the busy streets with a cart
containin all kinds of vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, etc., and
drawn by a spirited jackass—he can go to the Mooseum and reap
benefits therefrom as well as the lord of high degree.
“And this,” I said, “is the British Mooseum ! These noble walls,”
I continnerd, punching them with my umbreller to see if the masonry
was all right-but I wasn't allowd to finish my enthoosiastic remarks,
for a man with a gold band on his hat said, in a hash voice, That Í
must stop pokin the walls. , I told him I would do so by all means
“You see,” I said, taking hold of the tassel which waved from the
man's belt, and drawin him close to me in a confidential \". “You
see, I’m looking round this Mooseum, and if I like it I shall buy it.”
Instić of larſin hartily at these remarks, which was made in a goakin
spirit, the man frowned darkly and walked away.

Mooseum, as I said afore, but when I see a lot of erthen jugs and pots
stuck up on shelves, and all “of a uncertin date,” I’m at a loss to
'zackly determin whether they are a thousand years old or was bought
recent... I can cry like a § over a jug one thousand years of age,
...; if it is a Roman jug; but a jug of a uncertin date doesn't
overwhelm me with emotions. Jugs and pots of a uncertin age is
doubtless vallyable property, but, like the debentures of the London,
Glºun and Dover Railway, a man doesn't want too many of
€in.
I was debarred out of the great readin-room. A man told me I
must apply by letter for admission, and that I must get somebody
to testify that I was respectable. 'm a little 'fraid I shan’t get in
there. Seein a elderly, gentleman, with a beneverlent-lookin face, near
by, I venturd to ask him if he would certify that I was respectable.
He said he certainly would not, but he would put me in charge of a
policeman, if that would do me any good. A thought struck me. “I
refer you to Mr. Punch,” I said.
“Well,” said a man, who had listened to my application, “you have
done it now ! You stood some chance before.” I will get this infamus
wretch's name before you go to press, so you can denounce him in the
present number of your excellent journal, -
The statute of Apollo is a pretty slick, statute. A young yeoman
seemed deeply impresst with it. He viewd it with silent admiration. At
home, in the beautiful rural districks where the daisy sweetly blooms,
he would be swearin in a horrible manner at his bullocks, and whacking
'em over the head with a hayfork; but here, in the presence of Art, he
is a changed bein.
I told the attendant that if the British nation would stand the
expens of a marble bust of myself, I would willingly sit to some
talented sculpist. “I feel,” I said, “that this is a ãº; I owe to
posterity.” He said it was hily prob'l, but he was inclined to think
that the British nation wouldn't care to enrich the Mooseum with a
bust of me, altho' he venturd to think that if I paid for one myself it
would be accepted º by MADAM TUss AUD, who would give it
a prom'nent position in her Chamber of Horrers. The young man Was
very polite, and I thankt him kindly. -
After visitin the Refreshment room and partakin of half a chicken
“of a uncertin age,” like the Roman antiquitys I have previsly spoken
of, I prepared to leave. As I passed through the animal room I
rson was urgin the stufft
elephant to accept a cold muffin, but I did not feel called on to remon-
strate with him, any more than I did with two young persons of
diff'rent sexes who had retired behind the Rynosserhoss to squeeze
each other's hands. In fack, Irayther approved of the latter proceedin,
for it carrid me back to the sunny spring-time of my life. I’m in the
shear and yeller leaf now, but I don't forgit the time when to squeeze
my Betsy's hand sent a thrill through me like follin off the roof of a
two-story house; and I never squozed that gentle hand without wantin
to do so some more, and feelin that it did me good,
Trooly yours,
ARTEMUs WARD.
THE WIRTUE OF INTEMPERANCE.
MAGISTRATEs with Midas ears, harken to the words of HENRY
BROUGHAM, delivered at the meeting of the Social Science savants:—
“One sees with astonishment and indignation, in cases before Magistrates in the
country, intoxication urged in extenuation of offences, whereas it is a gross aggra-
vation. No Magistrate is entitled to suffer one such word to be uttered before him
on the part of the accused. Any Magistrate is bound to stop the party or his
advocate the instant he begins on this, and to tell him that if intoxicated he must
suffer a punishment more severe, and the Magistrate is further bound to take it
into his consideration when the prosecutor has stated it in explaining the circum-
stances of the case. It is undeniable that a most wholesome effect would be produced
by the general impression being made that drunkenness though by law it may be
not liable to punishment, except by small pecuniary penalty, yet makes offences to
which it has given rise more severely punishable."

assure you that the department is a very important one, and it has

Lord Derby. Deducting epigrams, some of us don't see any chance of
coming into a new coalition istry, and therefore are not afraid of a

Mr. Disraeli. England dislikes coalitions.
Lord Stanley. England is a wise child, and though it dislikes hysic,
takes it, when necessary. I have no doubt that we shall see a Mº.;
in which all the leaders will not be selected from one side.
Mr. Disraeli. Wishing, the noble Lord a good, place in such a
Ministry, I have done. My views are before the Cabinet.
Lord Derby, I don't wish to seem offensive when I say that I really
do not care which way we decide, but as a veteran who has fought his
battles, I think it fair to give advice to younger soldiers. The great
Duke never fought a battle needlessly. But Iown that it is also fair
that DiskAELI should have this chance, and not be laid open to taunts
that he dared not bring in a Bill.
Mr. Disraeli. Pray do not consider me.

much. And (laughing) it really does not much matter. If you will

a single point. When Letitia throws off her mask, she must feel, with
fear and trembling, that the manner of her reception by Doricourt will
be by no means certain. His pride might have resented the trickery,
even though the trickster were his own sweetheart. From what Letitia
knew of Doricourt's character, it could have been by no means clear to
her that, on her throwing off her disguise,he would exclaim, “Rapture
Transportſ Heaven'" And her º; “This is the most awful
moment of my life l’” spoken behind her mask, loses its force with an
audience who are more ready to take the words as jestingly applicable to
the matrimonial ceremony just concluded, than to the revelation about
to be made. It was altogether a very good performance, as you won’t get

be thanked for her laudable endeavours to instruct the boxes and

append a conversation:-
Young Gentleman (probably a Student of the Temple). I like seeing
these old comedies. (He evidently has a literary reputation among his
friends.) Instead of the Sensation Scenes of the present day, it is
delightful to hear such sterling dialogue as this.
His Friend (who prefers on the whole, “The Black Mask, or the
Delirious Demon,” but doesn't like to own his taste in the present company).
Well, yes—(with greater certainty)—Oh, yes. Yes. (They didn't get a bill
as they came in, as his companion “knew all about it.”) This was one of
Sheridax's, wasn't it?
Young Temple Gentleman (who didn't take a bill because he wished to
sare bor-keeper's fee, and thought that his friend's questions would only be
about the names of the actors). SHERIDAN’s P Let me see—(Up to this
time he had a general idea that everything was SHERIDAN's.) Yes, I think

WINTER MUSIC.
THE º: on the spray, the north wind howling through the
trees, the hail when pattering on the pane, the hounds when running
in full cry, all these make Winter Music, and any one who wishes may
attend the winter concerts Nature annually gives.
But there are other Winter Concerts which are annually given, at
the Crystal Palace, namely, every Saturday afternoon. Here the man
who hath some music in his soul may listen to the symphonies of
BEEthoven and MENDElssohn, of HAYDN and MozART, played as
nearly to perfection as wood and brass, and sheepskin, and lip, and
hand, and catgut are capable of reaching. Here a man may listen to
such sermons in tones as may comfort heart and soul, and make him
feel the better man for having lent his ears to them. Here the won-
drous chords of BEETHove N may thrill him to the bone, and fill him
with fit reverence for the majesty of music. Here, too, the female
mind, that cannot comprehend a symphony, may be entertained with
ditties which are usually well sung, and with lighter instrumental music
following the symphony. Between BEETHove N and the ballads, five
minutes intervene, that hearers who have different tastes may have
their exits and their entrances, and need not be forced to listen to that
which does not please them. If they have no mind for a symphony,
JPunch P. them sincerely, believing that it yields the very highest
kind of musical enjoyment. Still, they who do not choose to try
and cultivate their taste, may walk among the Qrange-trees, or peep
into Pompeii, or chatter to the cockatoos, or study the old statues, or
criticise the newest bonnets, till the symphony is over, and may
then go to their seats and ſisten for an hour to the soloists and
singers.
Then, supposing that their appetite for music be not satisfied, while
they feel the wakened cravings of an appetite for meat, they may
banquet at the Palace upon mutton-chops, or turtle, and, after their
dessert, may take their seats at Covent Garden, and listen to the music
of melodious MR MELLON.

Thompson. “WELL, SIR, I REELY DoN'T KNow what Is to BE DoNE It

“ ETHEL.” AT THE ADELPHI.
MANY worse plays than Ethel have found kinder critics. Why it should be
so, we will not presume to guess. Dramatic criticism in the London daily papers
is now, and, has long been, a mystery: one of the mysteries, however, best left
alone—on the old principle that the more you poke in it the less agreeable you are
likely to find its savour.
It seems that Ethel was half-damned the first night. One is so thankful to
find that the power of dealing theatrical damnation still remains to our excellent
British Public, that one would hardly quarrel with any exercise of the function.
But the Ethel of the first night must have been much worse than the Ethel we saw
last week, or the British #. as often happens with functions rarely brought
into play, was making a mis-deal of its double d’s. In point of fact, we are
told that one particularly offensive scene, in which MR. STEPHENSON (as father)
and MR. BILLington (as son) indulged in a prolonged chuckle, over the subject
of seduction, has wisely been cut out; and that our old friend, the pruning-knife
has been beneficially, applied in other places. That useful, instrument might still
be advantageously called in to lop some ten minutes off the opening part of the
first act, and nearly as much off the earlier portion of the last.
Probably John BULL, when he shouted “trash” and “rubbish”, as the curtain
fell on Ethel the first night, sniffed, the French atmosphere, which pervades the
piece, and didn't like it. In truth, that atmosphere is not pleasant; and it does
not lose in offensiveness when a strong dash of English vulgarity is stirred up
with the original “stock” of French profligacy. The French piece or story is
one, that needed especially delicate handling in the adapter, and in, the artists.
Such handling, with some eminent exceptions, it has not had at the Adelphi. The
vulgarity which is rampant in the part played º MR. BILLINGTON, for example,
would have been toned down by a more tasteful adapter, or softened by a more
refined artist. Such a Hilton throws the unfortunate Ethel quite out of gear. One
can't, for one’s life, understand how so refined a girl—and of course in the gentle
hands of KATE TERRY we cannot forget Ethel's refinement, for a moment—should
have tolerated such a swaggering snob, and even sacrificed for his most offensive
advances, the affections of the well-spoken, decently.
behaved little Doctor, so nicely played by MR. AshLEY.
If MR. BILLINGTON, had dressed and acted his part with
more judgment, we should not feel this incongruity. As
it is, it is forced home upon us every moment. M.R. BIL.
LINGTON has fallen into the great and perfectly super.
fluous, mistake of making Hilton Hordley more vulgar
than the other parts he plays. Let him try to refine the
part as much as he can, and he will isiſ, come up to
the mark of bearing and manners required to make the
retired linendraper's son tolerable.
There is not a word to be said on this score against MR.
STEPHENSON's Old Wordley. His purse-proud, selfish snob.
bishness was natural, quite in ; with his position
in the piece, and very artistically s aded throughout. It
would hard to point out any actor in London who
would have played the part better. But the part of
Judith is another instance in which, adapter and actor
concur to make an offensive original more offensive in
the copy. , Miss Fu RTADo should be less pert, and
º , which should be easy for one so pretty and intel-
Igent.
It is very common for our dramatic critics to confound
the part and the performer, and to ascribe merits to the
latter, of which the former ought to have all the credit;
but Æthel is really a part in which the actress has an
excellent action for heavy damages against the adapter.
With all the drawbacks we have allowed for, and in spite
of the drama's narrow escape the first night, there is
nothing now to be seen in London comparable to Miss
TERRY's performance of Ethel for refinement in the truest
sense, which in no º excludes power, but is rather
power in its most sublimated form; for those subtler
graces of acting which reach the heart while they delight
the eye; which satisfy the most exacting criticism, and
contain nothing to offend the most fastidious taste. With
the appreciation of gifts like hers are bound up the best
hopes of those who value refined theatrical art at the
present not very brilliant epoch of its fortunes.
There is no fear of a British public not appreciating
hearty fun, and well-uttered humour, in the hands of so
true a mistress of her craft as Mrs. Melios." But with
an average audience, we fear, the fun goes farther than
the art at all times, even in winning favour for such, an
Abigail as MRs. MELLON. Considering what our public
is, when our comic actors are conscientious as well as
laughter-moving, we ought to be very much obliged to
them. We owe Miss Mºiros a heavy debt of obligation
on this score. She is always a true artist, and never
loses sight of nature and its limitations, even when at her
blithest and broadest. But all lovers of the stage, and
especially all theatrical critics, should pray, for, and pro-
mote the due appreciation of that more refined art which
finds expression in an actress like Miss KATE TERRY; for
such appreciation requires culture and delicate perceptions,
fine susceptibilities, and hearts as well as heads in the
right place. May she long continue to delight us, and
may she soon have a pleasanter }. one giving more
scope to her great powers, and with cheerier surroundings
than she has in Eihei-though we must, in fairness, end
as we began, by expressing a very decided opinion that
many a worse, and infinitely worse-acted, piece has found
kinder critics.

To BENJAMIN PHILLIPS, MAYOR.
MY DEAR LORD MAYOR,
About to leave your chair,
And live in Portman Square,
(A neighbourhood I much prefer
Unto the noisy City stir)
To GABRIEL resigning
The dining and the wining,
The chain so rich and shining,
The robe with costly lining,
The seat where you sit fining
The sinner, but combining
Justice with mercy, twining
The sword with ivy, signing
Stern warrants with repining;
Now, that your sun's declining,
Hear me Swear,
Or, perhaps, in talking to a Beak,
More discreetly I should speak,
And say Declare,
That of a many Mayors who’ve sat in glory,
(Each having been my host),
You, for a many reasons known in story,
Have pleased me most.
Take the certificate, I’m glad to pen it,
And take the picture by my C. H. BENNETT.
My Lord,
For so you are while I indite,
And when the Public, with delight,
To buy me go,
You'll still be so,
(Though ere my date you quit your state)
Your Board
Throughout your Consulship, or year,
Of which the termination's near,
Has been—well—all a Lordly Mayor's should be,
And every dainty culled from earth and sea
Has been your guests’
Until their vests
Expanded, and their buttons started free.
But 'tis not therefore that I raise my song,
Jia'ere fortes ante Benjamin,
And I have sat at civic feasts too long
To be much moved by aught I find therein.
Nor, that your speeches do the City credit,
Though that's the truth, for I, my Lord, have said it,
Nor that before a King, and not long since,
You bore you like a gallant Merchant Prince,
When Brussels cheers
Our Volunteers
Hailed—and the wine and wassail did convince--
(Convince, I mean, that Belgian love was great,
Not in the Macbeth sense—intoxicate.)
Not for all this I raise my praiseful strain,
One that a King might sue for, and in vain.
But that because
When the fiend Famine gnashed her cruel jaws,
And rushed along her Indian way,
While the poor dead in heaps behind her lay
(Some cheeks will blanch when England asks the cause).
And when the sister fiend, that fierce Disease,
Sent a remorseful nation to its knees,
Wailing for its neglect of Nature's laws,
You, generous-hearted Jew,
Stood nobly out to do
Your part in work that made the Slayers pause.
So, PHILLIPs, take, with PUNch’s parting bow,
Praise rarely given by those who give it now.
REWERENCE FOR THE SEAT OF
ROYALTY.
. GENUINE humility is something yery rare, but an
instance, or rather two instances of it, occurred the
other day in the Scotch metropolis. The Duke of
EdinBURGH *śj the city of his dukedom,
found himself incommoded by the multitude of flun-
keys who followed him about and thronged him.
To evade this nuisance, his Royal Highness, having
need to go shopping, took a hack-cab from the stand.
In this pro g, however, he had been espied by
two ladies described as "well-dressed” in the joi.
o' Grout, Journal, according to which newspaper, as
soon as he got out of the vehicle, they “stepped u
to the cabman, and in winning accents demanded,
Hº long will you let us sit in your cab for .
shilling P " What Saint in all the Roman Calendar
ever performed such an act of humility as this?
How very little indeed the ladies must have thought
of themselves to think they could derive any dignity
from mere contact with cushion bearing the
recent imprºlº of the Royalty which it had
sustained ſ. Of course they supposed that it commu-
nicated to them some of the honour which, together
with warmth, had been imparted to it by the surface
which had rested on its own. What an utter absence
of º not to say of self-respect, is implied in this
truly humble idea!
But people who feel that they can contract from
a cushion honour which it has been imbued with
by Royal use, are capable of humility still deeper
than the lowliness of seeking to acquire that honour
by venturing to use the cushion likewise. In the
º of their self-abasement they would pro-
ably not hesitate to pay it the same homage as
that which enthusiastic Romanists render to the
Pope's slipper.
MOULE'S NEW GROUND-PLAN OF
SANITARY REFORM.
SHAKspeARE, we all know, knew everything, fore-
saw everything, had been in all lines himself, and
has put all things in his lines. It doesn't in the
least surprise us, however it may startle some
irreverent and un-Shakspearian peo (, to learn that
he even saw—in his mind's-eye—the earth closet—
that admirable invention of the excellent Vicar
of Fordington. This is clear from the passage in
Hamlet:-
“Well said, old Moule 1 Canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioneer 1"
We make a present of the line, as a motto, to
the Company that is working MR. Moule's valuable
—or should we not rather say, invaluable?–dis-
covery.
PRETTY PATRONS.
THE Standard, in its account of the Norwich
Musical Festival, says, in reference to one of the
evening Concerts:–
“The attendance was inconsiderable, particularly in the
Patrons' gallery, which was accounted for by the rumour that
the county families did not attend for fear of not being thought
to be amongst the invited to Costessey Hall, where there was a
And this is what the British Rural Swells mean
by “patronising” music. They stay away from a
capital performance (Mr. Punch is glad to read much
praise of a new overture by his highly meritorious
and also young friend, MR. ARTHUR SULLIvan) for
fear that the rustics of the lesser sort should º
that the º ones had not been asked to a

of such “patrons.” Is it not almost time that the
flunkeyfied word should be got rid of by artists of
all kinds P

mercial self-sacrifice, not to say suicide. We are further
informed that:
“A similar proceeding was adopted by the brewers in 1860, but
upon strong, representations of the trade the additional charge was
withdrawn the following year. It is understood that the trade have
again remonstrated with the brewers on the subject.”
The self-sacrifice of the wealthy brewers, however, is in-
considerable and moreover inconsiderate. It may be all
very well for those gentlemen, who have made their for
tunes, to retire from business; but in kicking down the
heer-barrel, which has raised them to opulence, they will
overturn the support of...all the poor publicans and

of their business by the act of their chiefs, to whom its
existence is no longer any object, because they can afford
to live without it in the height of splendour and magnifi-

eat deal more than it is worth, and the public will not
have it at any price which is even higher than that; so that,

nection with the º Station, and, for the enlargement of the
Station, to take part of the º of Apothecaries' How are
the Apothecaries to be paid by the London, Chatham and Doyer

land without paying for it, or to pay for it in debentures, which would
come to the same thing *
The names of the new streets about to be made by the insolvent con-
cern above;named do not appear to have been settled. There is in the
ancient, holy, and venerable city of Winchester, a street named Cheese-
hill Street, pronounced Chisel Street. With this spelling, it might be
adopted for one of them. The other two might be named respectively
Doo Street and Diddle Street.

in our Social History as the Milk Diet.

him,blandly, “Well,
policeman, what’s
the matter?” He
replies, “This here,”
and hands me this
printed paper:—
“WHEREAs you have
this day been charged
upon oath before the
undersigned, one of the
Magistrates of the Police
Courts of tho town of
Dornt n, sitting at the
Town Hall of Dornton, in the county of Dampshire, and within the .*.
Police District, for that you, on the 16th day j. instant, at the parish of
Little Boddington, in the county of Dampshire, and within the said district, did
unlawfully assault and threaten and beat one GroRGE CoRNELius PENNEFAthen,
whereby the said GEoRoe CoRNELIUs PEN N EFATHER goes in fear for his life.
“These ARE THYREpoRk to command you, IN HER MAJEsty's NAME, to be and
appear before me, on the 1st of October next, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon, at the
Police Court aforesaid, or before such other Magistrate of the said Police Court, as
may then be there, to answer to the said charge, and to be further dealt with
according to Law.
“Given under my hand and seal,” &c., &c.
“MORGAN JAMES BULLYER."
Good Heavens ! Where’s Dornton? Where's Boddington P Who
on earth is GeoRGE Cornelius PENNEFAther ? I tell the official,
then and there, that I never beat, or assaulted, or threatened, anyone.
He says, “He ain’t got nothing to do with it; it’s forwarded from the
other county district.” He adds, as a formula, that “anythink as I
say, now is safe to be used agen meat my trial,” and goes out with the
butler. “In Her Majesty's name!” I wish I was a istrate.
Happy Thought.—Refer to my diary. It was on that day, I find, that
I tried to get the repartee out of the railway porter, and there was a
disturbance in the Station. I suppose the porter's name is PENNE-
FatheR. Why, I'd forgotten all about it; PENNEFATHER hadn't,
though. He’s been, going about in fear for his life ever since:
PENNEFATHER must be a fool. “To be further dealt with according
to Law.” Don't understand it. I’ll run down to see what FRASER
says to it. -
Happy Thought.—N.B. Anyhow, consult a solicitor.
FRASER's in the cellar, arranging his bins, as usual. From the top
of the stairs I shout, “I say, FRASER!” and then his voice comes up
suddenly from the cellar, “Hallo!” like a ventriloquist’s. I say to
him, still from the top of the cellar-steps, “What shall I do in this
case?” He answers, “Is there another up, then P” being under the
impression that I am ºf to wine.
f explain, coming down five steps to do so, and FRASER listens,
while putting away some curious old Madeira. When I’ve finished,
I ask him what I shall do? He replies immediately, “Dine at six,
sharp.” “Yes,” I say, “and after dinner I’ll go up by the last train
to town, and see my solicitor in the morning.”
FRAsen agrees with me, and as I come up the stairs, CAPTAIN
TALBoots and a MR. MINchIN, who was at the party the other night,
come to make a call of ceremony. MRs. FRASER can’t receive them,
being still unwell, so I call down to FRASER, and announce them. ... He
replies, from below, just like the ventriloquist's man in a cellar, “All
right, I’ll come up directly.” I tell TALBoots about the tºº.
e is bellicose, and says, “If he was me, hanged if he'd pay any
attention to it. Blessed if he wouldn't go and punch the infernal
Magistrate’s head.” I point out to him that this would hardly clear
me of a charge of assault. -
Happy Thought.—Note, while I think of it. I will take lessons in
boxing: capital exercise. Gives you such a quick good eye: and
such a bad eye occasionally. See about it, after my solicitor.
MINCHIN, who is a young barrister, wants to hear the case, in full.
FRASER joins us, and listens, with TALBoots, like a couple of jurymen.
MINCHIN appears in several characters, during my story; but first, as
the judge, with his hands in his pockets, his legs apart, and his head
let me ask you, did you or did you not touch him?”
MINCHIN is calmly triumphant, repeating, “You did,” whereat FRASER
and TALBoots, in their impersonation of jurymen, shake their heads.
MINCHIN continues, “Did you or did you not call this railway official
a fool?” I can’t help it, I am obliged to admit that I did. Jury dead
against me. MINCHIN, now as the judge, having evidently abandoned
any idea of appearance as counsel for the defence, sums up carefully.
Somehow or another, MINCHIN's opinion suddenly appears most
valuable to me, and I listen anxiously.
MINchIN says—“You touched him, lightly or heavily, no matter,
the fact stands that you touched him. If you had no weapon in your
hand, yet you touched him. The porter was an unarmed man, you
own that you had an umbrella, and you are not sure that you did not
touch him with that.” I shake my head.. “Be that as it may, you
touched him, and that touch was an incitement to him to riot. It is
no defence to say, ‘I touched him †† on the shoulder,’ the question
is whether you could have touched him roughly in the position you
were placed in, that is, from the window of the railway carriage P. But
the law deals with intentions, and judges of the intentions both by
words and deeds. Now, you accompanied this blow—(I deprecate
the use of blow,’ and he substitutes,“touch,’ as if it really didn't
make any, difference) HYou accompanied this blow with the oppro-
brious epithet of ‘Fool.” Now the law having regard to the liberty of
the subject, and being no respecter of persons, will not allow any man to
go about touching his fellow citizens, lightly or heavily, and calling
them fools. No,” says MINchin, discarding the Judge, and appearin
finally as a private friend, “I’m afraid it 's a nasty case.” p.
think so, too. I put it thus, “If he says I did, and I can't say I didn't,
what defence am I to make?” I don't see. MINCHIN considers: FRASER
1Sº CAPTAIN TALBoots says, with a laugh, Qh, you sin
‘The Little. Pig Squeaked’ to the Magistrate, and he'll let you off.
His levity is ill-timed. They smile out of compliment, but the joke is
a failure. MINCHIN says, “Well, he must be off.” TALBoots says,
“He must be off, too.”
Happy Thought.—They are off.
Dinner, 6. Melancholy. FRASER thinks it good taste to joke about
“the prisoner sat down to his usual meal of which he partook heartily.”
On my telling him how much I have enjoyed my stay here, hoping Hºt
he’d re-invite me (9. FRIDOLINE 1), he replies, jocosely, “The prisoner
expressed himself sincerely grateful to W. oNAs, the Governor of
Newgate, for all his kindness.” . My train goes at nine; at half-past
eight I hear music in the drawing-room. I find out that it's Miss
FRIpoliNE, who's been dining up-stairs with MRs. FRASER. A fly at
the door. ÖAFTAIN TWinoots arrives with his cornet-à-pistons: he and
Miss FRIDOLINE are going to practise a duet. He offers me his fly
to take me to the station: I am obliged to accept it.
I go in, drearily, to wish Miss FRIDOLINE good-bye. She says, “Oh,
are you going so soon?” I have no reply ready, except “Yes, I’m
going now.” Whereupon she returns my adieu with the addition of
wishing me a pleasant journey. . As I am stepping into my fly I hear
the piano, and cornopean in a duet, “Yes, we together,” from Norma.
If I could run back, burst into the room, jump on TALBoots's back,
and cram his cornopean down his throat, I would do it... He might
summon me, if he liked, I should soon become used to that. Drive
on: he drives on. Furze Cottage is a thing of the past.
Happy Thought, or rather Unhappy Thought.—An opportunity missed.
When FRIDoline said to me, “Are you going away so soon?” I
ought to have returned impressively, “Soon! I am glad to hear that
since I have been here, the time has flown so fast. It will appear like
an age to me before I see you again. For,” and here I should have
taken her hand, and if neither TALBoots, nor FRAs ER, nor the butler
was looking, I might have kissed it fervently, saying, as I relinquished
it, “FRIDolin E, I love you.” Then, unable to utter anything more,
I should have got into my fly comfortably. I wish I could have those
minutes over again. I wonder if I should really do what I think
I should. I should like to drive back and try it. No-it can't be.
Happy Thought—To prepare oneself for occasions of this sort. I’ll
suppose cases as I go up in the train.
Nine o'clock. Off to London: Addio, FRIDOLINE and Furze.
I admit I did.

am never deceived, and something in that fellow's nose and left whisker
convinces me that he committed the crime. But law demands logic,
and conscience requires conviction, and you shall have both, of the
severest kind. Why shouldn't he have committed the crime P. He is
just the sort of man to do such a thing. He is five feet nine, and I
ave statistics to show you that five feet nine is the average height of
criminals. He squints, too, and what can be more likely than that
moral º: ould accompany physical?, Besides, Gentlement, he
has told you himself, that he was born on the 7th of July. He little
thought, when he made that fatal admission, that it was his sentence of
condemnation...Why, Gentlemen, do #. not know that at least five great
criminals who have gone to the scaffold lºng the last century were
all born on that evil, day, the 7th of July? I cannot insult you by
doubting that you will convict him. But there is more. I have evi.
dence to show that when he was a little boy he pushed a cat into a
well, from which the º animal was rescued only by a marvellous
accident. The child is the father of the man, and it is plain, therefore,
that the prisoner did the deed of which you are about to find him
º But I will overwhelm him with an avalanche of evidence beneath
ich the £". miscreant shall struggle in vain, like Enceladus under
Etna. (The jury took notes of this illustration.) A witness, whose tes.
timony is unimpeachable, was told that somebody has once heard the
prisoner say that, his grandfather never went to church. Gentlemen,
it is revolting to lay bare the black secrets of crime, but in the interest
of society it is necessary. What sort of morals can you expect from a
man whose grandfather never went to church, and who mentions this
detestable fact without a shudder? How, then, can you doubt that
he committed this crime f Again, gentlemen, what was found in his
portmanteau? He had but one clean shirt. There is guilt, blazing as
the sun at noon. Gentlemen, the despairing voice of his criminal con-
science told him that he should want but one clean shirt—only one—
the shirt in which he should be led to expiate his crime in the eyes of
an ji crowd. That fatal linen enveloped him as the shirt of
Nessus clad the dying Hercules. (Jury take notes.) Does an innocent
man go about with only one clean shirt P. Gentlemen, I have sixteen,
and I dare say that the care of your admirable and amiable wives has
provided similar stocks for each an of you—for you are innocent,
and unlike that guilty and ºf wretch. Bear with me still, Gen-
tlemen, while, as the organ of public justice, I adduce more evidence
of this atrocious monster's culpability. The crime is supposed to have
been committed at half-past six o'clock in the morning. É. criminal's
watch was overwound, and the works, broke, stopping the hands at
half-past seven. There is complete evidence of itself. He took one
hour to reflect over his wicked deed (and I do not wish to torture him
by recalling the agonies of that hour), and then, with a shaking hand
and in a nervous rage he tried to wind up his watch, and broke it. An
hour, Gentlemen, is just the time which it would take a man of average
sensibility to recover from the excitement of a crime like that which
yonder felon committed—this I shall prove to you by the evidence of
physicians of the highest character. Again, Gentlemen, I beg you to
observe him. It is afflicting to have to call the attention of virtuous
men to a vile object, but I ask you to steel your nerves, and observe
him. There he stands, the criminal | Does he look pale P No.; he
has hardened his heart. Does his eye fall P - No, in anticipation
of this day, and perhaps by the advice of my learned friend, whose
defence will lack'no merit ºut truth, he has schooled his base eyes to
confront those of honest men., But does he smile No; even his con-
summate wickedness is not bold enough to let him smile. But did you
mark one thing, Gentlemen? My learned friend uses an eye-glass, and
I am sure that I deplore his being in need of such an aid. A few
minutes since it caught the rays of the sun, and the reflection sparkled
in the criminal's eyes. He drew back hastily; ...Gentlemen, what did
he see ? A useful and scientific assistant to a failing sight? No, Gen:
tlemen... He saw something more dreadful. He saw the fatal knife of
the guillotine, glittering in the sun rays of morning, and ready, to
descend upon his neck-and he shuddered. He laughs. Does that
false and brazen laugh deceive you, Gentlemen? Ah, no; and he will
do well to lay aside all such miserable and abject devices for avoi
the doom which he sees written on your virtuous lips. Gentlemen,
sit down, and it is with no feeling of pride that I conclude my task of
wreathing round that frightful malefactor a coil fatal as the snakes
that encircled the devoted Laocoon. (Jury take notes.) I denounce
that man to the Justice of the Universe.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 197
LET THE VOICE OF THE TURTLE BE HEARD
IN THE LAND.
To Mr. Punch.
IR,-We live in an age which
calls itself, an age of huma-
nity. I call it an age of hum-
bug. We ain't humane. I
used to think we were, but
now I say we’re brutes, or
next door to it. It's true
there’s what’s called the
after broken-down cab-horses
with raws on 'em, and over-
driven bullocks, when the
drovers helps 'em on by twist-
ing their tails and using ten-
penny-nails at, the end of
their goads. , I'd like to know how the Society would manage to
get an over-druv, animal to the slaughterer, if they was asked to set
about it? And I think I’ve heard of a Society for looking after stra
dogs, and restoring 'em to their owners. Such societies may be
very well in their way—though I don't see it myself—but, bless you,
suppose they was what they talk 'em up for, how far do they go ? For
one act of what they call cruelty that they're down on, there's a thou-
sand they take no count of, and can’t be expected to, if they was twice
as sharp as I take 'em to be. No, Sir, we’re little better than a set of
brutes. I may seem to i. strongly, but it is because I feel strongly.
At this moment I am blushing for §§ England, when I think of our
horrible cruelty, and unparalleled ingratitude as well, to what I will
venture to call the most blessed and bountiful of all our benefactors. It
ain't our poor I’m alluding to. Paupers is paupers, and wants a tight
hand over'em. Mind I don’t say they ought to be allowed to die of bed-
sores, bad air, and vermin, for all that. And I’ve often told our Board
that the newspaper people will be down on us if we shut up our bed-
ridden people at i. without fire, candle, or attendance. There's sure
to be a fuss if anything was to happen to any of 'em, such as tumbling
out of bed and not being able to get in again, or going off sudden in a fit
of coughing along of nobody lifting their heads up, or such like, as old
eople will do, you know. I’ve even voted for two paid nurses to our three
undred sick paupers, and I think you’ll own that’s liberal, and shows
what I'm made of And we’ve got 'em, too—leastways we've got one,
and have another under consideration; only there’s two crotchety
chaps on the Board objeets to her because she’s been turned out of
three hospitals for drinking. No ; our workhouses is right enough
while there’s Guardians like me on the Board, and there's enough of
us, I think I may say, to leaven the lot. And I don't mean our out-
door poor, neither, that ain't on the rates—what’s called “the lower
orders,” you know—them that works for weekly wages. There’s a deal
talked and wrote about that class—you hear as how landlords is hard,
and agents sharp and screwy; how they won't give their small tenants
a wholesome water-supply, and P. repairs, and sinks, and sewers,
and such luxuries. Bless you, I’ve had small house property—worse
luck!—and I know what that means. Give your tenants all they ask
for, and they’d never stop asking. That sort don't like being com-
fortable. , Start 'em with a nice water-butt, the best of brass, taps,
Company's water on twice a day for an hour at a time, a beautiful pipe-
drain, and in a week there'd be a dead dog in the water-butt, the
brass tap would have walked off to the nearest marine-store, you’d be
under notice for running the water to waste, and the pipe-drain would
be blocked up with ºf hats and blacking-bottles. ..It’s all very well
talking of keeping such a set as tidy as if they was living in Portland
Place; but it can't be done, and give you twelve per cent. for your
investment, and that’s as little as you can get on with, in small house
H.; No, Sir, depend on it our small tenements is all right.
rust the landlords to look after them.
And it ain't our climbing boys, neither, nor our little pottery hands,
nor. Sheffield, grinders' boys, nor our journeymen bakers, nor our
milliners' work-girls, nor our slop-workers. Poor people must live,
and work for their living, and can't be nasty particular how or where
they does it; and employers must have their profit. All the talk
about ventilation and healthy *...* and inspection, is like the
talk about better houses for the poor. f it means anyt it's cen-
tralisation (and we all know what that would do for us, ruining our
glorious constitution, and treating us like Frenchmen or Prussians),
and if it don't mean anything, which it usually don't, it's bunkum.
Nor it ain't our sailors neither that I’m alluding to, for all they talks
about dirt, and bad air, and bad food and scurvy, in the merchant
service. They don't think of the expense of lime-juice. , No, it ain't
none of these I’ve my eye on. Besides, even if all these kind of {º}.

ment as human beings, the suffering innocents, and yet we make their
passage to our shores, a scene of such torture and suffering, that the
old slave trade was º: to it.
I allude, to QUR TURTLE-ouR FINE LIVELY TURTLE, the blessed
greatures that flounders on the West India Dock quays, that flops in
the tanks at the Albion, and ultimately, bless’em'ſ comes to de ight
Qur palates, and comfort our stomachs at Corporation and Company's
ners and other feeds given by parties that know what’s what, and
haven't to pay the bill.
Yes, Aſº. Punch, we’RE Actually cruel to our TURTLE After
that fă like to know what right we have to call this “an age of
humanity.”
- Here ’s the passage I cut out of the Pall Mall Gazette last week. I
Ain't partial tº the paper. Its religious principles are shaky-little
better than rational, our rector tells me—and it don’t respect Boards of
Guardians. . Things always goes together, if you’ll observe, and Com.
sitºtional Institutions hangs by one another. However, though the
Pall Mall Gazette can put up, with Bishop Copenso, and believes in
DR. ERNEST HART, I’m thankful to see it ain't quite lost to all good
feeling. Tt can still speak up for the poor suffering Turtle. Here is a
copy of the paragraph. Excuse blots—which they’re tears:–
“Now that the slave trade has been abolished, humanitarians are turning their
attention from the negro to the turtle. That miserable reptile suffers quite as much
as the African has ever done from the horrors of the middle passage, its fins are
brutally titched tº its sides with rope yarns, and it is then packed either upright
on its tail, or standing on its head, for the better cconomy of space on board the
steamers which convey it to its doom in New York and in London. In these dis-
tressing positions thousands of turtles cross the Atlantic in all weathers. Many die
tº transitu from agony and fatigue; or rather would die, if they were not killed.
But the butcher's knife generally anticipates the exhaustion of nature, and every
morning the turtle pen on board the transatlantic steamer is narrowly scanned by
the steward, in order that those which exhibit the most decided signs of approach-
ing dissolution may be butchered for the use of tho first-class passengers' table. A
benevolent society in America has at last raised up its voice against the wasteful
and unnecessary cruelties practised on these poor creatures when at sea, and is about
to communicate with the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
on the subject.”
Well, at last, there’s a chance of that London Society doing some
useful work—something it may be proud of. Protecting Turtle is a
thing a man might be glad to subscribe for. I’ve sent my name to
the Society, for a guinea annual, as long as they look after the Turtle.
I hope you won't think I’m stepping out of my line if I enclose you
a copy of verses. They ain't mine, but a young man in my establish-
ment, that I spoke to on the subject.
Entre noo, He's the party as do our advertisements, and well worth
his salary, though I say it.
“Where is the hand that will crown with the myrtle
The bust of that old % worthy sublime
Who the palate first cuſtured to love of the turtle
And crowned its green fatness with punch of the lime?
All unknown is that name that with glory should shine,
Should be blessed o'er our soup, an invoked o'er our wine.
When of “clear and of ‘thick” we inhale the perfume,
And a double allowance of green-fat consume;
When the loving-cup carries my LoRD MAYoß’s salute,
And the voice of the toast-master never is mute;
When on fish of the sea, and on fowl of the sky,
And on beasts of the earth, civic gourmets : high;
When the swells and the nobs at the Mansion House dine,
'Till with toasting and talk my LoRD MAYok seems divine;
What still crowns the feasting and hallows the fun?—
'Tis the juice of the Turtle, when all’s said and done.
Qh, if earth have one joy that has ne'er proved a sell,
'Tis the fat that you taste, and the soup that you smell!”
There, Mr. Punch, I think you’ll own that’s about equal to ByRoN.
I hope this well deserved mark of respect to the ill-used Turtle, that
we all owe so much to, will have its effect, and that we shall hear no
more of the atrocities of the Turtle pen and the horrors of the middle
passage.
I am, Mr. Punch, your obedient Servant,
MARMADUKE MARRowPULL.

MR. BRIGHT AND MR. SHAKSPEARE.
Y a contemporary we are told
that a question lately an-
nounced for discussion at
a meeting of the Oxford
Union Debating Society was,
“That, in the opinion of this
house, MR. BRIGHT is a re-
proach to the country that

Parliament for the benefit of Ireland, where, when Bills are under-
oing consideration in the House of Commons, would you go to find
their supporter but to the seat diligently occupied by the Hon. Member
for Birmingham; Echo answers, “Nowhere!” However, no doubt,
it was good enough fun for the Oxford Union Debating Society to
dispute if John BRIGHT is a reproach to his country. The next ques-
tion which that argumentative but humorous body will propose to
consider, will perhaps be, “Was WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE an Ass?”
HAPPY THOUGHTS.
(In London. Consulting a Solicitor.)
Going up in the Train by Night-I intend to call on my Solicitor
about this, assault, affair directly I get to town. Think I’
better dismiss all thoughts of it from my mind. Will read paper.
Can’t. Light in carriage so bad, . At the first station I want to
get out to complain to Guard. . Can't : carriage locked. ... Passenger

most useful. Other Passengers get in ; all got keys and lamps. If
we go on like this we shall bring our own gushions. Last man did
get in with a cushion. The next thing will be to bring your own
carriage.
Happy Thought.—To buy a railway lamp.
Can't sleep on account of the blaze of light in my eyes from lam
opposite. Arrive in town late. Go to Solicitor's. Shut up. To hotel.
et up early to-morrow. . I see that I’m chalked up on a black board.
89.730. The Boots, is satisfied: another Boots coming by acci-
dentally is satisfied. Waiter assures me, on my inquiring anxiously,
that if I gave the Boots my instructions it would be all right.
Difficult to get to sleep. Noise, after quiet of country, terrific.
ºffſ Thought. Central hotels bad for going to sleep in. Do for
men of business, º who want to be up early in the morning. Bed.
Morning—Not called: had to ring the bell to tell them to call me.
Boots says he didn't know I wanted to be called, didn't see it on the
black board. A different Boots. I refer him to the other Boots for
confirmation, in fact to the other pair of Boots, . He doesn't know
them : he alludes to them disdainfully, as the Night Porters.
Happy Thought. Small Hotel’s best: where the Boots and Night
Porters are on friendly terms. Do it next time.
I’m very late. They bring me number ninety’s boots; and number
seventy-five's breakfast, which I don't like. More delay. Off at last
to Lincoln's Inn Fields. To SEEL's, my Solicitor's.
On the door is MR. SEEL, above, and MR. PERCIVAL SEEL
below. Who MR. PERCIVAL is, I do not know; probably SEEL's son
just come into the business. I knock and ring.
The clerk is a small boy with a large forehead, ready for all the law
that’s coming in to it one of these days, curly hair which won't lie
down under any pressure of pomatum, and large eyes, which wander
all over me.
On being asked if MR. SEEL is, within, he replies, “No, he’s
not,” in an uncertain sort of manner, which leads me to suppose that
patriotism, would you go to |}.
he is in. I give him my card. He looks at it, and then at me, as if
unable to trace any connection between my name and my appearance.
Happy Thought—I note that to be, brought "; in a lawyer's office
makes boys suspicious. He evidently doesn't believe either me or
my card.
Boy says, “He’s not in:” but he adds, “you can see MR. PERCIvaL,
if you like.” He speaks of them as if they were a show. I ask who
MR. PERCIVAL is, and he replies that he's MR. SEEL, JUNIOR, which
he evidently thinks is a more dignified form of description than calling
him MR. SEEL's son. I consider. Well, yes, I will see MR. SEEL,
JUNIoR. I am shown suddenly into MR. SEEL, JUNIOR's room. MR.
SEEL, JUNIOR, is very much junior to MR. SEEL, SENIOR.
He offers me a seat timidly. He says, awkwardly, that he believes
my business is with his father. I say yes, but I suppose he’ll do as
well. He evidently detects some hesitation in my tone, as he answers
boldly, and, to mythinking, defiantly (as though if his father did come
in he didn't care), that, “Oh, yes, it would be precisely the same
I tell him it’s a very simple case, whereat I fancy he seems more at
his ease. I suppose he can advise me. He replies, “Oh yes, of course.”
But he doesn’t inspire me with confidence. I tell him, to re-assure
him, I’ve known his father some years, which seems to make him
uncomfortable. I tell my story very carefully. . When I’ve finished,
he asks me to tell it again... I do. At his special request, I tell it once
more, with (I can't help it) variations, which puzzle him. I ask him
what I shall do? He appears confused, and thinks; at last, he says,
“Well, you see, I’ve only lately come into the office, and—” (here
he laughs nervously) “I can't exactly advise you without—without-
” (here he loses his theme, but recovers himself) “without, in
fact, consulting my father.” Then I’d better see his father?
he says, diffidently, “if you please.” I say I will, whereat he is much
relieved, and, so to speak, breathes again. must see his father
to-night—most important—at eleven. suggest, at all events, that,
having spent one hour with him in painstaking narration, MR. PERCI:
wal may put the case before his father. I don't believe he's understood
a word of what I’ve been saying, as he replies, “No, you'd much
better do it yourself.”
Happy. Thought.—What a dreadful thing it would be to have an
idiot Solicitor.

it down. Good-bye.
Happy Thought.—Nothing to do in London. Dismiss all thoughts
of PENNEFATHER's assault from my mind. How shall I amuse myself?
Go to Charing Cross. Stand for ten minutes waiting to cross the
road. Don't know why I should cross at all, having no object in
reaching the other side, except to come back again. I came up, to be
very busy with my Solicitor, and here I am with nothing to do.
Special appointment. Inote
distroll into Bow Street.
Happy Thought—Visit the Police Court, and f up the forms and
ceremonies, so that when I have to appear, if I ever have, before, a
Magistrate, I may know when it’s my turn to speak, and when to be
silent. Go into what I take to be the Police Court. Am asked what
I want by two policemen. They are civil, but suspicious... I won't gº
in: I will dismiss, all these thoughts from my mind. I find myself
continually dismissing these thoughts.
Drop into my Club. , Letter waiting for me from — at the Feudal
Castle. Will I come down when I like: only telegraph. I will when
this business is over. This business—no, I said I would dismiss
these thoughts from my mind, and I will. But I must answer him.
Not necessarily. I can wait until I know...if I am free to
Dismiss thoughts again for the third time within ten minutes.
In St. James's Street. Somebody slaps me on the back, and says
allo! What brings you to town?” It is MILBURD. . I dislike
MILBURD at Boodels', but when you meet him in town, and can't get
any one else to talk to, he’s not a bad fellow. I wish he wouldn't think
slapping on the back, a sign of heartiness. He tells me afterwards
that he considers “slapping a fellow suddenly on the back when he
doesn't know who the deuce it is,” a first-rate practical joke. I don't
think it first-rate. “Well,” he puts it, “not bad,” I state my
general objection to all practical jokes. He agrees with me, excepting
slapping on the back. ... I give in on this point, not liking to be
obstinate, and suffer for it, as he's always, being with me for two hours
in the day, ºff to take me by surprise. I tell him, my case. He
sympathises. e is not a bad fellow when you know him. He says,
‘Look here,” I avoid his slap, and he goes on somewhat disappointed,
“come and dine with me this evening. Dismiss all thoughts of your
trial.” I don't like his way of speaking of it, but his idea is the same
as mine about dismissing the thºught, “ and spend a quiet evening.
I'll give you dinner at my Club.” I tell him that I’m not in the
humour for a dinner-party. He informs me that, it’s no party, only
ByRTON of the Fusileers. I repeat, “Oh, only BYRT6N, of the
Fusileers,” as if his presence was nothing at all; though I’ve never
seen him in my life. MILBURD says, “’Yes, that’s all: say 630
Bradshaw.”
Happy Thought.—Always note down engagements.
…
I am noting
… Yes,”

this. MILBURD (he is an ass sometimes) says, “Good-bye, old boy,”
and slaps me on the shoulder. I am inclined to be annoyed, but he
laughs, and cries, out, “Another practical joke, eh?” so I can't be
angry. Besides, he has asked me to dinner. -
e comes back for one minute, to ask me “if I think that bonneting
a fellow, knocking a hat right over his eyes, is a good practical joke,
eh?” I treat the notion with contempt, as beneath such a man as
MILBURD. . I think this is the best way of stopping him, | repre-
senting such conduct as unworthy of him, or if I don't, ºf t crush
mine in : he's just the sort of fellow to do it. “Full of animal spirits,”
his friends say. It’s a nuisance if you’re not full of animal spirits at
the same time. Go to my hotel. Unpack writing materials. Try to
do something in Typical Derelopments about Spirits of Animals. Think
of FRIDOLINE. Think if this matter ends happily . . . . Dismiss all
thought of this sort, from my mind. Doze. Hot water. Dress
to go to MILBURD's Club.
He introduces me to ByRTON of the Fusileers. He is friends with
me in five minutes, and is telling us in a half-whisper with his head
well forward towards the soup tureen something “which of course,”
he knows, “won't go beyond this table.”
• ByRTON can tellus curious circumstances about every one. If we
talk of the Great Mogul, he is ready with a curious circumstance
about him of course, entre nous ! Milburb and I are perpetually
swearing ourselves to secresy all through the dinner. Trying to note
down (privately outside the door) one of his remarkable anecdotes,
names excepted, I find myself making rather a muddle of
confidences.
Happy Thought.—Capital wine, Moselle: sparkling. Not so strong
as champagne.
We dispute this point, and try champagne. I note down the name
of the wine-merchant. BYRTöN tells us something rather curious
about him. It is decided that we shall return to the Moselle. I must
keep my head clear, having to see my Solicitor at eleven. MILBURD
says, “Oh, don’t think about that, now. We will have some more
his soon at Sºlic’tor's. Very. SEEL SEN’R in.
Moselle, or champagne.” (On referring to my notes in the morning,
which I made as opportunities occurred outside the door, I find the
names of several wine-merchants put down as “MR. Moselle” and
“MR. CHAMPAGNE SPARKLING,” and I don’t know quite what I meant.]
The dinner goes on. So does the Mcselle.
Happy Thought.—Ask for Moselle at my Club. Ask MILBURD and
BYRtoN to dine with me. [Referring to notes in the morning can't
make out date.]
They accept. We accept to dine also with ByRTON: don't know
when. The room is ". hot. The next bottle of Champagne wants
more icing., Capital, wine Champagne: so’s Moselle. We are, all
telling, good stories in confidence, hoping they’ll go no farther than

that the puffing gentleman calls himself STRADUARIUs REDIVIvus, and
that provincial critics have no word of remark upon this piece of sweet
taste, but accept the same, and laud the fiddler as if he were a JoAcHIM.
These facts would not be very remarkable, as times go. But look at
this certificate which the fiddler publishes. We will not give the real

DEAR SIR,-We, the undersigned, being amongst the recognised
musical authorities of Broguetown, and as many of us have had the honour of
being personally and professionally acquainted with the original STRADUARIU's,
think it our pleasing duty to assert that ãº. playing of fantasias, unaided by any
other accompaniment than that supplied by your own violin, was to us a source of
wonder and admiration; also, that your performance of the Overture to William
Tell, upon one string only, and without any hairs to the bow, is absolutely marrellows:
and that by it you have, in our opinion, extended the limits of “the possible" in
violin playing to a degree hitherto undreamt of even by your great prototype himself:
in fact, you have out Straduariused Straduarius. You cannot fail to awaken in every
town the same excitement and enthusiasm that you did here.

We commend the above to the notice of the Professors of the Divine

been done in this case, are not acts that we should think worth notice.
Fiddlers must live, or at least they think so. But if the “Recognised

bankery, we think that the Professors of the Divine Art generally should
be aware of this new homage to its dignity; and so we throw away a
couple of paragraphs on a fiddler's puff. -

THE TURN OF A CORKSCREW.
A PART of the DEAN of CoRK’s speech at the late Church Congress
turns out to have been incorrectly reported in the paper whence it was
quoted by Punch, with comments. The Very Reverend Dean did not
say “that men had passed to the extreme of thinking there were no
opinions worth burning men for.” What he did say was, that “they had
assed into the extreme of thinking there were no opinions worth being
urned for.” A very particular friend of the Dean writes to Mr. Punch,
ointing out the misstatement as above, and says, “The DEAN or
É. is sure that you can have no more wish to roast him in Punch
for words which he really never said—than he (the º to burn any
man for any cause whatever.” Well said. Mr. Punch has to thank the
DeAN or Cork's friend for a good joke, although a joke at Punch's
own expense. Indeed Mr. Punch is very happy to stand the joke.

“AND Did you Ask ANY LITTLE GIRLs To YoUR WEDDING, MAMMA ’”
“YEs, DEAR, sever AL LITTLE GIRLs."
“AND, PRAY, why DIDN'T You Ask ME?"
SELF APPRECIATION IN EXCELSIS.
MR. PUNCH, not happening to want the services of the accommo:
dating creature who advertises as below, reprints, a delightful
announcement:–
CHANCE WANTED, by a married gentleman, who is qualified for
a superior or subordinate situation, who can keep a set of books by double entry
with any one, write a leader on any given subject, act as an efficient secretary to an
individual or a company, fill any general office, with credit to himself and satisfac-
tion to his employers; requite confidence and kindness with energetic, faithful, and
devoted service: and who, in short, wants little but what he here advertises for—
a chance. Address, Nil Desperandum, &c.
Nil Desperandum seems an unworthy motto for such a Phoenix.
The wonder is that such a wonderful being should not already be
Prime Minister, or College Porter, or, something of a tremendously
superior kind. His politics are not in his way—he will write a leader
on any given . and of course in any given direction. He will
fill any general office, whatever that may mean, perhaps the office of a
General—why does not JonATHAN PEEL take him into partnership :
He will requite kindness with devotion—he wants only to be patted
on the head a little, and he will jump over any stick, or bite anybody
ener etically.
And he is married. He may have married without
“a chance,” as he says, which is not considered wise in ordinary cases,
but his prescience told him that his future was safe, and MRs. NIL
DESPERANDUM must be an enviable lady. Failing anything else,
could he not apply at the Horse Guards, and ask whether there is a
vacancy for a jolly good trumpeter
Contradiction.
We do not believe the statement that the Jamaica Committee intend
to follow up their proceedings against MR. EYRE by a prosecution of
M. Du CHAILLU for shooting and stuffing so many of our African
relations, the Gorillas.

THE POPE AND MR. GLADSTONE.
“MR. Gladston E has had a long interview with His Holiness, and is reported to
believe himself to have wrought certain convictions in the mind of Pi Us THE
NINTH.”—Correspondence.
Mr. Gladstone (howing with much elegance as he approaches His
Holiness). Salve, Sanctitas.
His Holiness. Tu quoque salvus sis, mi fili.
Mr. Gladstone. Placetne paulisper confabulari, Sanctitas
His Holiness (smiling). Non recuso. Moreover, having all know-
ledge at our command, we shall be happy to converse with you, Sir, in
the tongue in which you are said to have marvellous skill; we mean,
your own.
Mr. Gladstone. I thank your Holiness. Visiting in the Eternal
City, with some personal and political friends, I have thought it
respectful to your Holiness to solicit the interview which has been so
graciously accorded.
His Holiness. I am always glad to see visitors. FANNY ELLsLER
came to see me. So did LoRD DUDLEY. Take a seat, and pray forget
that I am anything but an old Italian clergyman, who is very happy to
receive an English friend.
Mr. Gladstone. Your Holiness's condescension is very kind. But
might I venture to ask its further extension?
His Holiness. Refreshment? Dabo tibi aliquid boni. (Is about to
sign to a servant.)
Mr. Gladstone. Ego domijentaveram, thanks, your Holiness. I did
#.allude to creature comforts. I should not have thought of such a
g.
His Holiness. I had an idea that you English never fancy yourselves
welcome, anywhere unless you are set ‘ī; and drinking directly.
Mr. Gladstone. We certainly eat and drink too much, your Holiness,
but some of us can dominate our appetites. I was about to ask your
Holiness whether I should be regarded as officious if I touched upon
public affairs.
His Holiness. Do you know, I would much rather hear a few
anecdotes of your London society. - |
Mr. Gladstone. My poor budget should be heartily at your Holiness's
service, but you will be asked to receive a visit from one who can tell
you much more, I mean my friend and late chief, the EARL RUSSELL,
who edited the Journals of Tom MooRE, and has a very good memory
for the stories contained in that book.
His Holiness. As you please, my son. But at least tell me how your
Ritualists are getting on. . . .
Mr. Gladstone. Not to speak irreverently, Holiness, the cauldron of
mock-turtle soap will boil over one of these days, and then let the cooks
look out for scaldings.
His Holiness. Real turtle being at their service, I shall not compli-
ment their present tastes or sympathise, in their future misfortunes.
Enough (with majesty). And what does MR. GLADSTONE want to say
to St. Peter P -
Mr. Gladstone. Nay, if your Holiness takes, that attitude, the
humbleyisitor has only to thank your courtesy, and withdraw, (Rises.)
His Holiness. Sit down, can't you?, I thought you would appre-
ciate a touch of finesse. Do you want to talk Liberalism to me?
Mr. Gladstone. Definitions, your Holiness, are perhaps not the thing
in the best society, but the word you have used approximates to the
suggestions I had ventured to think of making.
is Holiness. Make them fearlessly. Do you want me to go away
with you, and sail in MR. MILNER GIBSON's beautiful yacht for Malta,
where I shall be received with a salute from the English cannon, be
treated with every luxury, and find on my toilette, table a book
obligingly supplied by the British and Foreign Bible Society.
Non possumus.
Mr. Gladstone. I cannot sufficiently admire your Holiness's good
º: and pleasantry. Though out of office, I may take the liberty
of assuring your Holiness that England would know how to honour
a venerable guest. It is not with an inhospitable purpose that I would
suggest what might make such asylum needless.
is Holiness. Shall I send a Golden Rose to King Gallantman?
Mr. Gladstone. Better so, Holiness, than that Rome should send to
him to come for that and some other articles.
His Holiness. ANTONELLI would go mad to hear you.
Mr. Gladstone. The Cardinal is mad already. , Quem Deus, and so
forth, your Holiness. His counsels are most detrimental to your best
interests.
His Holiness. There is an old proverb to the effect, that if you can't
kill your enemy, you should give him your daughter to wife. I can’t
hang ANTONELLI, so I obey him.
Mr. Gladstone. It is the earnest wish of all thoughtful men, your
Holiness, that anything like violence should be avoided in the changes
which are coming upon Rome. The bigots who express personal hos-
tility to a Pope are in a miserable minority.
is Holiness. MANNING telegraphed to me that there were a great
many Guys in London on the Fifth, and that several of them repre-
sented myself.
Mr. Gladstone. Precisely, Holiness. Dirty boys and foolish old
women of both sexes represent your personal enemies in England. If
an Englishman were so fortunate as to assist in the settlement of your
º ties, he would receive the applause of the best part of his coun-
rymen.
His Holiness. I am very glad to hear it. Poor England shall be
remembered—wherever I may have influence. But your English pre-
scription I take to be more effectual than agreeable. I am to give up
everything, and then nobody will ask me for anything more.
Mr. Gladstone. Not so, your Holiness-—
His Holiness. What? They will ask me for more after I have given
up everything ! That will be rather exigeant.
Mr. Gladstone. I scarcely like to submit alternatives to your Holi-
ness, but it really appears to me that you will soon have only Three
Courses open to you.
His Holiness. Name them, Peelides?
. Mr. Gladstone. Let me put it with more periphrase than I had
intended. It may be that your Holiness will reconstruct the present
system here—it may be that you will prefer retirement to another
locality—it may be, pardon me, that your retirement may be enforced
by the Romans. -
His Holiness. Reformation-abdication—expulsion. Three pleasant
things. Well, of three evils, I will choose the least.
Mr. Gladstone. I may venture to assume, and I do so gladly, that
your Holiness means—
His Holiness (smiling). We must not tell all our State secrets at once
and to a foreigner, before, apprising our own advisers. Be assured
that we are much ob y your kind interest in our welfare.
Mr. Gladstone. Ignosce, quaeso, si quâ in re offenderim.
His Holiness. Ego abste idem peto. Discedamus, for such humble
food as an aged priest can offer awaits us, and if you do not say that
the Lachrymae is scrumptious— [Eneunt.

AN AWFUL WARNING.
MR. PUNCH is the last person to spoil sport. “More Ates, more
Alès, stir them on,” is his motto., Pacification is the thief of fun.
Still, fair play is the brightest dew-drop in the British Lion's mane,
and when a combatant is exposed to an unforeseen peril, Mr. Punch is
the first person, singular, to cry Mens tuus oculus ( In this spirit he
respectfully invites the persons who are touting for subscriptions in
. to get Ex-Governor EYRE hanged for saving Jamaica, to take
note of the fate of Shylock. That gushing Hebrew, under, pretext of
avenging the wrongs of an oppressed race, sought to use the law un-
justly, to the detriment of a gentleman. The fearful result was, first,
that the prosecutor was heavily fined, and secondly—we tremble to
}} up such a menace to our vengeful friends—he had to turn
Aristian.

FROM the quarries of Bermuda, in my intervals of leisure,

Arena where brain wrestles with law for wealth and station,
Metropolis of industry, whose knights we boast to be
To me, a baffled actor, driv'n from the stage with hisses,
In convict-garb and quarry-gang condemned to eat my heart,

Had I my life to live again, what a different life were mine !

Cursed and railed at thee unheeded, or but earned thy Christian

NOTORIETY FOR KNAWES.
THE more hilarious portion of British playgoers would
doubtless be highly diverted by a sufficiently laughable
burlesque of Fidelio. In the prison-scene of the mock
opera, where the hero and his companions in captivity
come out of gaol, a fine effect (the idea of which would
have amused BEETHoven) might be produced by the
introduction of the Rogue's March. But a more suitable
adaptation of that }. of music is suggested by a para-
graph in the South London Press, to wit:-
“ UNJrst WEIGHTs.—At a Special Sessions at Newington, on Wed-
nesday, sixty-eight tradesmen were fined for having in their possession
unjust weights, scales, or measures. The list comprised twenty-five
licensed victuallers and beer retailers, eleven chandlers, five butchers,
eight bakers, one eating-house keeper, five coal and potato dealers,
five grocers and cheesemongers, one fruiterer and fishmonger, two
marine storekeepers, one corn-chandler, one woolstapler, one iron
merchant, and one zinc worker. The fines amounted to £121 15s.
Curious to relate, one of the persons fined—a widow—rejoiced in the
name of WIRTUE INNOCENT 1" -
And a truly proper name: as much so as BLANCHE
would be for the niece of Aunt Sally, or for the sister of the
Coal Black Rose. But to revert to the Rogue's March. A
most edifying impression would have been made on the
mercantile mind in a small way of business if the Magis-
trates who fined the sixty-eight tradesmen above referred
to, and MRs. VIRTUE INNOCENT, could have caused them
and her to be marched, to that good old English military
measure, during a certain time every day for a week,
about the streets of London. To render this procession
the more distinctly instructive, the convicts composing
it might have been made to carry banners, respectively
specifying the name and, fraud .# the bearer. An Act
of Parliament ought to be passed, enabling justices to
institute, on occasion, this sort of spectacle with appro-
priate musical accompaniment. oreover, it should
empower them, to compel every tradesman convicted of
using false weights and measures, of adulteration, or of any
|sort of ºi Or lº to exhibit, for a stated
period, in his shop window, a large poster notifying the
particulars of his conviction, and also, at his own expense,
to advertise them at least thrice in the Times newspaper.
“The HEAD AND FRONT OF THEIR of FENDING.”
LADIEs if you go on diminishing the size of your head-
dresses, you must be punished—you must be bonneted.
I BELIEVE
| And now thy high career of bold rectitude high-crowning,
Like MARIUs at Carthage, amid collapse uncowed,
Bayed by London, Chatham, Dover debenture-holders frowning,
Thou drown'st loud accusation in defiance yet more loud.
Ah, had I but had the wisdom, in my days of young ambition,
Like thee, friend, to look upwards, and choose the better part!
To aim at high financing and scorn small imposition,
And despising tens and hundreds; to millions raised my heart!
Had I felt the truth that with their scale things English change their
nature, -
That what in pence is “swindling,” “speculation” grows in pounds:
I perhaps had learnt to elevate to thine my moral stature,
And from my gig, like thee, defied detraction's baying hounds!

As it is, here in Bermuda, a convict, sad and seedy,
I read of my friends' progress in finance's pleasant ways,
His ever ready charities unto the poor and needy:
The fair chapels he endows, and the unctuous prayers he prays.
And I feel that what our chaplain says is true unto the letter,
(And wish like you to prove it, I'd my life to live again)

The absurd men, young and old, who, whilst American toilettes are
costing between six and seven thousand pounds, desire that, English
matrons and º girls should limit their apparel by considerations
of economy, will rejoice to hear of the daily diminishing length and
width of dresses; but they will be dissatisfied with the information
that the diminution is as yet confined to walking dress. They will
learn, with due vexation, that evening dresses continue as long as ever,
and they will derive peculiar annoyance from the fact that the Oracle
of Fashion commends the length of the skirt in calling it “graceful.”
Nor let them flatter themselves that they are going to save, or to be
encouraged with the prospect of saving, anything by a partial retrench-
ment of skirts. This º be safely compensated by augmentation of
the garniture thereby revealed. All ladies of taste will indemnify
themselves for their diminished drapery by extension in crural invest-
ment. They will, of course, take generally to wearing Hessian boots
of increased altitude, and more and more costly materials and manu-
facture, in defiance of mankind's opinion, and to the envy and admira-
tion of each other. What are these things to men, except articles
which it is their place to pay for? And ". great recommendation of
long trains for evening wear is that, as often as they are trodden on and
torn a necessity is created for a new dress. It is hardly possible now
for a lady to walk out of a theatre without º train arrested in
descending the stairs by the foot of the man behind her, who is look-
ing about him, and thinking about SHAkspeaRE, or something else.
This is as it should be; and the curmudgeons who object to so natural
a course of things from parsimony, ought to provide the ladies for
whom they are responsible with train-bearers.
An effort, according to Le Follet, is being made to “make the bonnets
more bonnet-like,” in spite of which, “at present, the ‘Catalane’ and
the “Lamballe” are very perceptibly the favourites.” Nevertheless, it is
the opinion of our º contemporary that “as the winter
sets in a more comfortable coiffure will º its appearance.” It had
better: otherwise the consequence will be the very general indispo-
sition of fashionable females. Lucky will be those who merely catch
the slight catarrh; influenza will be prevalent amongst the influential,
and beauty will be very generally affected with cold in the head; so
that, in recording the approaching winter fashions, Le Follet will have
to state that noses are now worn red at the end.
EENLAN SURGEONS IN THE ARMY.
THE Fenians, and all such friends of England, will be overjoyed by
accounts received by the Pall Mall Gazette from the Army Medical
ing School at Netley. These accounts the Pall Mall Gazette calls
more pleasant than surprising. The Fenians, and their like, will perhaps
deem them more surprising than pleasant; though that is not certain.
The fact is, that the unpopularity of the military service with the
medical profession is so great, that, as our discerning contemporary
says-
“For some years it has hardly been possible to obtain any English students, and
not many Scotch. The Irish schools have been swept freely. The present batch of
students at Netley exhibits this peculiarity of national distribution in common with
others of the last few sessions, but it seems to have a greater variety of mauvais
sujets than usual. Two of these medical gentlemen have been lately expelled for
drunkenness, and one publicly reprimanded.”
Now, the Fenians will of course rejoice to learn, first, that the
majority of students in training for Army-Surgeons are Irish, and,
secondly, that they are mauvais sujets; because an Irishman who is
also a mauvais sujet, or bad subject, may be presumed to be, or to be
ready to become, a Fenian. all know what work a Fenian Army-
Surgeon would be likely to make with a knife in his hand, and a British
officer at his mercy. The notion of Fenian Army-Surgeons in Her
Majesty's Service, must, of course, then, be extremely pleasant to
MR. STEPHENs, and the rest of the Brotherhood; but surely, in the
present state of Europe, and in the face of their own conspiracy, the
existing condition of our Military Medical Service must be still more
surprising. It surprises us immensely when we think how perse-
veringly the Duke of CAMBRIDGE has been for several years labouring
to carry out the ations of the Royal Warrant designed to meet
the wishes of medical officers; and especially, when we consider the
signal encouragement to enter the Army which his Royal Highness
has just afforded the medical profession º promoting MR.ELKINgton
of the Guards, indefiance of all remonstrance—of course, on the groun
of pure merit—over the heads of his seniors.
SPORTING NEWS.
Mr. Punch is happy to announce that the Garotting Season has
opened, and that some very good * has already been afforded. On
º at dusk, Mr. Conky Bill and Mr. W. Sikes succeeded in
bringing down an old gentleman with one of the finest gold watches
that have been seen in Houndsditch. The next evening, Mr. Horse-
monger Lane and Mr. Bigg Bludgeon brought down the father of a
family by a couple of well-directed blows on the back of his head, but
their º and gallantry was not rewarded º spoils,in consequence
of the approach of a little girl, whose steps they mistook for those ºf a
policeman. But on Wednesday night, Mr. Gorging Jack and Mr.
Guzzling Jimmy, assisted by that promising young ãº:
Billee, garotted a governess who was returning from Clapham with her
week's salary, and they effected an easy retreat. About the same hour
on Thursday, Mr. Black Muzzle, accompanied by his friends Mr.
§o." foºter and Mr. John Cadger, made a determined attempt
upon a War.Office clerk, who was on his way home to Kilburn, but we
regret that the ferocity of the quarry not only prevented a capture, but
injured one of the sportsmen, whose eye was poked out by the umbrella
of the infuriated clerk. On Friday, the only success we heard of was
gained by a party of sportsmen from Bow, conducted by the well-
known ranger and guide, Isaac Moses Smouch, whose sagacity soon
brought them behind a º who was incautiously carrying in
both hands presents for his children, and who therefore was soon at
the feet of his captors. But on Saturday night there were several
splendid heads of game brought down, among them a noble medical
man on his rounds among the poor, and who fell, to the bludgeon of
Mr. Richard Ghrimes; an old city clerk, going home to his family
and whose pocket-book rewarded the daring of Mr. Nobbler an
Mr. Smasher, junior; and an author who, on his way to his club,
unguardedly took a short cut through an unfrequented, street, and
who was brought down by four or five sportsmen º repairing
to the spot, and making short work of the unlucky scribe. We may
therefore congratulate the garotting public on the auspicious inaugu-
ration of their season, and we may add the good news that several
Members of Parliament have been viewed, and are reported as haunting
the Belgravian and Tyburnian Squares... We doubt not that our
adventurous sportsmen will give a good account of some of this
game, as the dark nights come on.
MILLINERY AND MURDER.
Among other fashionable novelties, we see...that the , "Sadowa
Autumn Dress” is pretty largely advertised. What a delightful taste
it is to use the title of a battle as the title for a lady's gown, thus
mingling in the mind ideas of finery and bloodshed! Perhaps we next
may see the “Murderer's Mantle” advertised, or else the "Cut-throat
Crinoline.” The Solferino scarlet has been popular in its day, and
bright eyes have sparkled at beholding the Magenta crimson. It is so
nice to mix up millinery and manslaughter. Perhaps the “ Strangler's
Shawl” may next come into fashion, or else the “Burglar's Bonnet.”
War, in many cases, is merely wholesale murder; and if Sadowa
dresses are hºld in high repute, there would seem to be no reason why
the fair sex should not like the names of their new clothes to be taken
from the columns of the Newgate Calendar.

BRAVO, BOXALL | WELL DONE, WORNUM
We have to record an act of heroism on the part of the Director and
Superintendent of the National Gallery. Not the muzzling of MR.
GREGoRy, nor the taking off of MR. AYRTON or MR. Cayendish, BEN-
TINCR §*. nor the dexterous dispatching of MR. MoRRIs MooRE
to a world where there are no Raphaels in §: market but his own.
They have done a feat far more heroic than any of these. They have
dared to brave the bray of the noodles and the º s—a very
powerful body among the connoisseurs—and to have the dirt taken
off some of the National Pictures'. Not off all, unhappily, but off
just enough to give us a relish of the beauty that lies drowned,
fathom deep, under SIR GEORGE BEAUMont’s liquorice-water, and the
late MR. SEGUIER's favourite brown varnish. These men have actually
had the pluck to dive to the bottom of these filthy brown standing
ools, and to bring * the jewels of RUBENs, and PoussiN, and
iºn Rosa, as bright as when they left the hand that set
em.
. They have ventured to let us see trees green, and skies blue, as these
ridiculously naïf old masters actually had the courage to paint them.
They have removed the crust and the rust, and the patina of venerable
antiquity,+in other words, the old cleaner's dirty work,+till we stand,
for the first time in this generation, face to face with the Château of
Stein, the grey walls, the small stone-framed windows aflame with sun-
set, and the briery copses of the chase, where the keeper is stalking
the sitting covey, and the hay-wain comes lumbering home; and the grey-
green willows of the polders, square on square, through which the full
streams course, lazily, for miles of flat, to where the towers. of
Antwerp twinkle against the sky in the golden smile of the setting
Sun. they never did another stroke of work in the Gallery, MR.
Box ALL and MR. WoRNUM, have earned the nation's gratitude, the
freedom of the city of London, the Humane Society's first §. for
saying persons apparently drowned, and the Geographical Society's
old medal for the most interesting discovery of the year, by stripping
the BEAUMONT stucco of brown varnish off RUBENs's Château.
They have done an equally successful work, and one quite as much
wanted, for GAsPAR PoussiN and SALVATOR Rosa. But though
Abraham and Mercury look all the better for having their faces washed,
there was no such beauty as RUBENs's to bring to light from under the
yellow mask.
Of course, these bold innovators can’t hope to escape, the penalty of
their pluck. They must expect to be abused by old, fogies of the
BEAUMont school, who like their trees brown, and their skies black; by
snarlers of the MoRRIs MooRE breed, who find everything a National
Gallery Director does ill done; and by the echoes always ready
to swell the chorus of Noodledom. The pack has opened already.
An idiot, writing in the Telegraph, raves over the ruin of the renovated
Rubens, and i. about its having been “painted over with lemon-
yellow and filthy megilps,” the fact being that not a touch of colour or
a drop of º has been put on to the canvas, only some inches of
filth most carefully removed, under the Director's own eye, by a dex-
terous Italian hand. So well has that hand done its work, that, it
deserves to be immortalised in our columns, and it shall be. The
dirt-destroyer in all these cases, is one SIGNOR PINTo... No relation to
the well-known FERDINAND MENDEz—for he tells no lie when he calls
himself “a cleaner.”
Mr. Punch, in the name of the nation, thanks MR. Box ALL and
MR. WoRNUM for their good sense and courage, and congratulates
them on the triumph which they have achieved. And looking round
his National Gallery with pride and pleasure—which culminate as he
takes his hat off before the homely but most touching pathos of REM-
BRANDT’s “Christ Blessing Little Children,” the new Director's first
purchase, and a noble one—he notes how of his Art-treasures some of
the grandest—notably, the Lazarus of SEBASTIAN, DEL PIoMRo–still
wear the “coat of darkness,” which we have read about in Jack the
Giant-Killer, and which renders the wearer invisible, , Turning from
the renewed Rubens to the sunken and smothered Sebastian, he asks
why the courage and skill which have bared for us the real face of the
one, should not be employed,—under close and competent superin-
tendence,—in taking the mask of dirt off the other?

SEMPER
IDEM AT EXETER HALL.
To Mr. Punch.
ould you be so kind, Sir,
as to use your irresistible
influence with the govern-
† ment of the Sacred Harmonic
Society, so as to induce
them to provide some, suc-
cedaneum for occasional per-
formance in the place now
invariably occupied by
MENDELssoHN's Lobgesang.
There are certain mights
when that Society is accus-
tomed to present the Public
with two several composi-
, tions, the works of two
different masters. One of
these, on one night, is, for
example, MozART's Requiem,
another, on another night,
RossINI's Stabat Mater, a
third, on a third might,
Tºri BEETHoven’s Mass in C.
– Tºm But, on every one of the
three nights, one of the two
works performed is always
the Lobgesang. So that, suppose aman has heard th. Requiem at Exeter
Hall, and goes to hear the Stubat Mater, of necessity, unless he eschew
one-half of the performance, he must also hear the Lobgesang a second
time. I will not say that the Lobgesang will not bear hearingasecond time,
but I will say, that I, for one, found a second hearing of it as much as
I could bear, without impatience. But now suppose that the man who
has heard the Requiem and the Stabat Mater wants also to hear the
Mass in C. He cannot hear the Mass in C at Exeter Hall without
having again to hear the Lobgesang, or to hear only half of the music
which he has paid to hear. Now, to many men, at the third hearing
the Lobgesang begins to be a bore. It did to me. But the Requiem,
and the Stabat i. and the Mass in C will each of them bear a
second hearing at least as well as the Lobgesang. A second hearing of
each of those works involves, in succession, a fourth, a fifth, and a
sixth hearing of the Lobgesang, or so many payments for hearing it if
not heard. Surely this is an intolerable deal of %. in comparison
with other music. . If the directors of the Exeter Hall Concerts cannot
do without the Lobgesang, if they insist on adjoining it to every other
--
work whose performance takes up a certain time, could they not make
the inevitable Lobyesang the second instead of the first of the two works
performed. It would then be possible forus who are bored with the Loboe-
sang to bolt as soon as the work which we came to hear was over, and
thus escape the alternative of enduring the other or risking our seats.
If we must take fat and lean together for our allowance, let us at
least have the option of leaving the fat without hazarding forfeiture of
the lean, or vice cersä. I do not insist on the special analogy between
the Løbgesang and fat. To my taste its frequent repetition at Exeter
Hall lºft". it rather, a similarity to stale bread. Its conjunction
there with something better is the musical equivalent to stale
bread-and-jam, and many who like the jam, will, as to the bread, be
disposed to say ditto to yours truly, JAM SATIs
A KING'S JUDGMENT.
SINCE the Judgment of SoLOMON, there has not been a more re-
markable sentence than that which Mr. Punch, an all-unworthy
medium, now imparts to the myriads.
The subject is the merit of that great Welsh Bard CRIston, or
CYNDDYLAN, of whom honourable mention was made at the last
Eisteddfod, mention which he deserved by a Poem, noble passages of
which are translated as follows:–
“A sigh ascends up to the heavenly land,
From the heart in the shape of the letter O.”
And thus—
“The army in fear of his manoeuvres fled, -
In the absence of an arm they were thankful for a leg—"
And again (David describes his fight with the lion)—
“He gave a leap; but o'er my head he leaped;
More angry still, he back again did spring,
But sideward, I jumped over his º: --
And, finally,–
“As the ox is charmed by the green grass of the dingle,
As man is charmed by night's deceitful light,
As youth is charmed by woman's eye of love,
As the cuckoo chaffer is by the cuckoo charined,
So is David charined upward toward heaven.”
This inspired bard has been a good deal chaffed by the cold-hearted,
and a King comes forth to vindicate a Minstrel. ...We read in a Shrop.
shire paper a letter frºm a MR. THOMAS, of Derbyshire, who says,
“In conclusion we will quote the Rev. W. CALEDFRYN WILLIAMs's,
the KING of MoperN WELSH BARDs, adjudication on CyNDDYLAN's
prize. : on the late “Rev. DAVID Rowlands of Llangeitho,”
Cardiganshire: ”—
“Another competitor would have a real claim for this prize were it not that
“Criston' (CVNDDYLAN) stands before him on the list. This author is full of origi-
nality and spirit, akin to the spirit and originality of Rowlands himself, when he
broke over the sanctified fol's. Rowlands was a peculiar man in his days. It was
therefore necessary to have an elegy for him superior to all that have ever been
written before in Welsh ; and we have this in a great measure by “Criston The
*ost callous and obdurate stoic could not read this elegy without feeling intestine emotions.
It would defeat eveu David HUME, the notorious infidel.”
The King has spoken. Let the people note his words, and be dumb.

SIR. M. P. REFORMER AND MORALIST.
SIR MoRTON PETo has been º: telling speech, at one of the
Colston Festival dinners at Bristol. e are informed by the Bristol
papers that SIR MoRTON was vehemently cheered. But as the Bris-
tolians cheered SIR MoRTON’s “explanation,” they could hardly do
less for his speech. - -
If they cheer SIR MoRtoN, they hissed Burks. Taste runs in the
blood electoral, and probably the two things explain each other.
SIR MoRTON's subject was Reform. e do not observe among
the Reforms he recommended the appointment of an Official Registrar
of Railway Debentures, to check over-issues, or that of an ex-officio
Director, on every Board, to prevent cooked accounts, and generally
to spoil the Directorial or Contractorial broth. -
SiR MoRTON lecturing on Reform is an edifying spectacle, and will
suggest to many a modification of an old saying about physicians
; themselves. - - -
SIR. MoRTON was very great in exposing the delinquencies of our
naval and military administrations. Who should know better what
mismanagement means than SIR MoRTON? Why won't these wretched
public departments take a hint in conducting their business from our
railway companies? Why the clever fellows at the London, Chatham
and Dover would teach them how to knockoff a couple of millions from
the estimates, and add four millions to the expenditure, in no time,
without Parliament's knowing a fraction about it, unless they took it
into their heads to appoint a Committee of Investigation, And then,
think what a blessing it would be if we could have great “financiers,”
—men with a real modern genius for finance, and a thorough mastery
of every dodge in the money market—men like SIR MoRTON and MR.
Hodgson, or poor calumniated GeoRGE HUDsoN-at the Exchequer!
Why they would conduct the Government, on Railway principles, rig
the three-per-cents up to fifty premium, and payoff the nationa debt:
by debentures. , And if it did come to a national bankruptcy, what
then P. We needn't pay our creditors. Railway Companies don't.
But as we can't have SIR MoRTON. at the Exchequer, and probably
cannot hope even to keep him long in Parliament, it is a comfort to
think we have him, to point our morals for us. He says that what
has taken place with reference to poor MR, SNIDER has quite shocked
the moral sense of the entire country. So it has, SIR MoRTON, and so
have one or two other things, Ah, if poor SNIDER had only invested
his capital in London, Chatham and Dover debentures, instead of

A very pretty domestic piece by MR, CRAVEN is to be seen at the

of the most charming bits of painting I’ve ever seen on any stage,
large or small. The three * houses seem to be doing excellently

of ringing the punning changes on their names, is beyond me, and I

That he’d live like a game fighting-cock.
And then, as for glorification,
If your Holiness cared about that,
You would meet with profound adulation,
Upon all sides, as fulsome as fat.
Wherever you went, I will bet, you
Would be lustily cheered by the mob,
And assiduous crowds would beset you,
With the taste of the true British Snob.
If you preached, admiration would urge on
Greater numbers to go and hear you,
Than have ever yet sat under Spurgeon,
Or been drawn by the Rºverexplºilºw.
Expositors hostile endeavour
To make out that Rome's Pontiff's the Beast.
Thus much we may grant them, however;
You would here be a Lion, at least.
Lords and Dukes would compete for the favour
Of your tasting their dishes and wine;
And of course—in Lent turtle would savour-
The Lord MAYoF would invite you to dine.

Your blessing you, after the grubbing,
Could impart to the City and Globe.

At Rulers and States you could aim;

For needful were that limitation
Of libel to keep a free course;
And our Alien Act give Prince or nation
No occasion to bid us enforce.
Observing this easy condition,
You would live more completely at home;
And hold a much safer position,
Holy Father, in London than Rome.
And should you, the Vatican quitting,
To England be pleased to repair;
You would find here a mansion as fitting,
The Alhambra, to wit, Leicester Square.

PUNCH'S POLISH FOR A BELGIAN JEWEL.
THE Order of Leopold is, we suppose, a jewel, and we are sure that fair play is
another. Mr. Punch, the Patron of all the Academies, the Artist's Benevolent

artists, or the public, has an idea that he is called on to deliver an utterance.
Certain British artists recently exhibited works in Belgium, and upon two of
those gentlemen the aforesaid Qrder has been ºf Whº. may
flash from it ought to be cheerfully hailed by their brother artists, and the donation
should be considered as a compliment to the profession. MR. CLARKson

must rejoice at any foreign recognition of the genius which he has so long and so
nobly displayed. He º: on his laurels, yet not so quietly but that he occa-
sionally rises to paint for us a fine picture, worthy of his fame. The other
gentleman who has been decorated stands very high in his profession, and his
works enjoy a popularity which is shown by their being household favourites, nor
can we see why he should be grudged the Belgian jewel. MEssRs. STANFIELD
and FRITH did not receive the Order for courtly reasons, but in accordance
with the recommendations of the Belgian jury which sat to deliver verdicts in
regard to the merits of the works exhibited at Brussels. This is the official
answer to the inquiry made by the younger recipient of the honour, . Mr. Punch,
who values no distinction which is not conferred by himself, (or by his Sovereign
at his suggestion) nevertheless deems it his business to set this matter exactly
right for the world and for The Ages.
A Delicate Offer.
THE Senate of Oxford has been informed by the outgoi
that an offer has been made by a gentleman to found an annual prize of the value
of for good reading among the Candidates for Holy Orders at the Univer-
sity. The gentleman inquestion wishes to be anonymous. No wonder. Offering
candidates for Holy Orders a prize for good º; is like offering a young lady

is very commonly too evident, as soon as a parson opens his mouth.

A SHINDY IN THE CITY.
“A Court of Aldermen was holden yesterday in the Long Parlour at the

An Alderman. Irise to order. The line must be drawed somewhere,
and in this Court it ought to be drawed above monkeys.

be the fashion here, the sooner Mayor, Show, Corporation, Dinner, and
all the rest of it are given up the better. We are a tradition of the
ast, a historical link, or we are awful nonsense, and the Loving Cup
is the pasteboard giblet—goblet, I mean—of the stage...The moment
we begin to laugh at ourselves, let us abandon our turtle and eat our
goose—for it is cooked. (Sensation.)
This speech made a deep impression upon the Court, and the subject
was referred to the Committee of Privile The Lord MAyob had
wanted to go in State to Guildhall to help the Duke of EDINBURGH
to open an excellent Charity Bazaar, but it appeared that the Mace
could not be removed from the Court during a sitting, so the Charity

a proposal by a young Alderman that the LoRD MAYon should go
with the Mace, and leave his Umbrella to sustain the Majesty of their
proceedings was indignantly scouted. Punch does not yet despair,
therefore, of the safety of the civic republic.

Nephew. Is it true that DR, Pusey denies that he and his adherents
demand or enforce Confession?
Uncle. Yes. I hope he means what he says, and says what he
means. If he preaches the necessity of Confession, when he says that
he doesn't enforce it, he equivocates; and an equivocation, meant to
mislead, is simply a lie.
Nephew. Does Pusey claim the same powers as those asserted by
Roman Catholic Priests P
Uncle. So I understand. -
Nephew....What do the Roman Catholic Priests say of his pretensions?
Uncle. That they are false. The Roman Catholic Priests disown
connection with DR. PUsey. They consider him no priest at all, and
not even a Catholic. . In their estimation he is no more a priest than I
am, and no less a heretic. The Roman Catholic, Priests, with the
Pope at their head, and the whole Greek Church besides, Patriarch
and all, hold precisely, the same opinion of DR. PUSEY as that which
the President and College of Physicians, and the President and College
of Surgeons entertain of Professor Holloway. - - -
º . That is to say, they regard DR. PUSEY as an ecclesiastical
quac
Uncle. Yes; or rather a lay quack; no ecclesiastic at all.
dºw. May not DR. Pusey's pretensions be as well-founded as
elrS
Uncle. Yes; if theirs and his are equally unfounded. By far the
greater part of Christendom votes DR. Pusey a humbug. I do not
say a conscious humbug; but still a humbug. On the question whether
he is a humbug or no, that is, whether he is a priest or no, DR. Pusey
is in a very small minority. All Protestants think him a humbug. All
Roman Catholics think him a humbug... The contrary opinion is con-
fined to the High Church party in the Church of England. DR, Pusey
is certainly not a humbug-if the authority which º: Pope claims is
vested in that body of English parsons. - -
Nepºew. Was a young lady caused to remain in an Anglican convent
against her will by DR. Pusey's threat that, if she did not, he would
Sease to be her “spiritual director,” and no longer grant her absolution,
for want of which she feared she would be “lost"?
Jim. “AND THE GENTLEMAN, Too, SIR.”
Uncle. Such a statement has been made in an account published by
a lady of her experience in an Anglican Sisterhood. , Let us hope that
the lady was misinformed, and that the story is utterly untrue.
Nephew. Don't you believe it?
Uncle. I have no evidence for its truth, and the gown of DR. PUSEY
remains on his shoulders.
Nephew. You don’t approve of Father Confessors? -
Uncle. Especially not of amateur Father Confessors. Confession has
been abominably abused even in the Roman Church, by the Romanists’
own showing, as in the evidence for the defence in that cause célèbre,
Achilli v. NEwMAN. It is liable to foul abuse even there where it is
practised as a system, subject to strict regulation. The probable
results of its irregular and unrestricted practice may be imagined.
Nephew. Cannot your sham Father Confessors be turned out of the
all Church 2
Uncle. Hardly. In these days it would be almost impossible to turn
a Mormonite out of the Church—let, alone a Puseyite. The only
feasible º is to turn them out of the house whenever they are foun
in it, and the º of ejectment would be best performed by the act
of kicking as hard as possible, for which I would recommend PATER-

PAPERS AND PASSENGERS.
WE lately noticed a placard, advertising a certain journal as a “First
Class Evening Paper.” The idea of a first-class paper implies the
supposition ºf second and third class papers., Why should not the
two latter classes of papers be also advertised as such? By an ex:
tension of the same plan novels and other works could be announced
as first, second, and third class publications. People, would thus be
uided in the selection of newspapers, periodicals, and books, so as to
. enabled readily to choose those suitable to their tastes and circum.
stances; and the option of taking his own class would accommodate
every traveller on the lines of literature.

Hose
the Report on the Recruiting of
the Army returned by the Com-
missioners appointed to consider
that pressing matter, will perhaps
be of opinion that the most valu-
able part of it consists in the fol.
lowing postscript or appendix:-
“DISSENT.
“Feeling most strongly that a suffi-
cient pension is what soldiers look to
more than any other boon or advantage
that may be offered to then, and also
being of opinion that the recruiting for
the Army may be much injured by the
unfavourable account that a dissatisfied
pensioner may give of the service, and
vice versá, in the case of a satisfied
pensioner, I reluctantly dissent from the
recommendation of the Commission as to
the amount proposed to be added to the
2d should be added to the present rate
of all pensions to non-commissioned
officers and soldiers.”
There is no object that more tends to counteract the eloquence of the
recruiting sergeant than the sight of a ragged and famishing old soldier,
or of a veteran in the workhouse. If the superannuated hero has the
cuff of an empty sleeve pinned to his breast, or is hobbling on a wooden
leg, he is a spectacle all the rather operating to the discouragement of
martial impulse. He is, as it were, a scarecrow, deterring all reason-
able spectators from adventuring to tread the path of glory in which
he got mutilated, so that he is now for the town's end to beg during
life in order that he may be enabled to eke out a starvation allowance.
If the soldier's retiring pension is even raised by fourpence instead of
twopence, making it twelvepence a day, will what a grateful country
thinks of its brave defenders be very much more than adequately repre-
sented even by the munificent sum of one shilling?

a winding-up order was made last week. We do not rejoice in the

A WORD ON RAILWAY SLEEPERS.
(To Mr. Punch.)
SIR,
I READ, the other day, a statement, in the Times with the sig-
nature W. I. S. H. I wish you would allow me to say something
which it suggests. The writer avers that he not long since was talking
to a guard in the Midland Counties, and that he found on inquiry that
very often men were compelled to work thirty-six hours uninterrupt-
edly; that if a man, thus overworked, ventured to remonstrate he was
invariably dismissed from service; and hence it is that engine-drivers
are often found asleep on their engines, or at least so drowsy as to be
unfit for further duty, though still fº some hours' duty to perform.
No wonder, observes W. I. S. H., we have accidents, but who, he
asks, are the persons blameworthy –and he so far answers his own
question as to reply, “Surely not the overworked engineer, but rather
they who exact more than is reasonable from those in their employ.”
That is to say, I suppose, the Railway Directors. Now, Sir, I am a
British householder, and I am liable to be summoned to serve on
Coroner's Juries, and I will tell you what I will not do if ever I have
to sit on the fragments of the body of somebody who has been smashed
by a railway accident, arising from the drowsiness of any official
occasioned by overwork, or, let me add, from inexpertness, or incom-
petence, the fault of inadequate remuneration. I will not, whatever a
fool of a Coroner may tell me, be such an ass myself as to agree in
returning the verdict which the asses, who too commonly constitute
Coroners' Juries, are accustomed to return in such cases. I will not
be a party to finding a verdict imputing criminal negligence to the
merely unfortunate guard, stoker, engineer, signalman, or pointsman.
That is what I will not do. Now, Sir, I’ll tell you what I will do. I will
insist on giving in a verdict of manslaughter, not to say wilful murder,
against those Directors who, because they will not give wages enough
to ensure ability, engage servants who are unequal to their duties, and
unfit to be trusted with peoples' lives. I will, as I am a true-born

PUNCH. OR THE IMONDON CHARIVARI.
[DECEMBER 1, 1866.
- - A PASSION FOR ASTRONOMY.
ZADKIEL'S OWN FUTURE.
It is with pain that Mr. Punch has read in the Globe newspaper the
paragraphs to which he is about to refer. But he hastens to say that
that excellent journal has erred only from want of the information
which is in Mr. Punch's possession. In reviewing the predictions which
the unfortunate Zadkiel has made for 1867, the Globe, with a natural
and gentlemanly indignation at the liberties which the astrologer has
taken with the names of distinguished persons, observes,
“September threatens the Kinos of Italy and 8Axony—and the PRINCEss
Louis A again: why cannot the fellow leave our Princesses alone * Does it delight
his maid-servant readers to find evil prophesied of princesses. Constantinople and
Venice, Manchester and Liverpool (again (), are to have troubles in October; but
royalty is spared in that month for a wonder. However, in November the PRINCEss
HELENA is again persecuted by the stars."
Even severer remarks than these would have been more than justi:
fied, but that it is not generous to strike a person when he is menaced
by terrible dangers. The Globe had not taken the trouble to consult
the stars in reference to the future of the astrologer himself. Mr.
Punch has before him ZADKIEL's own horoscope for 1867, and a sad
one, it is. In January the persecution of the unlucky creature will
egin, for Jupiter is in the second house, and the aspect of Sirius is
lurid. About the middle of the month, ZADKIEL will nearly be choked
by the tail of a shrimp, but will cough it up. Without, giving the
astral configurations by which his fate is made clear to the youngest
student of the sublime science, we briefly state the rest. In February,
he will be terribly cut in shaving. In March, a maid-servant will, out
of spite, manage to spill a kettle of boiling water over his, left leg, and
he will be confined to his house until April, when he will slide over a
iece of orange-peel, and severely damage his southern configuration.
n Mºſ he will have many things stolen from his house, and his chim-
ney, will catch fire. . In June, he will fall down-stairs. In July, he will
be knocked down by a carriage. In August, he will buy some toad.
stools instead of mushrooms, and be awfully ill for several days. In
September he will sit down upon a live cat, and be severely bitten, but
cauterisation may prevent evil results. In October, the stars seem to
indicate a treacherous calm, but it will end early in November, when
| he will fall over the coal-skuttle, break his shins, and knock his head

against a pewter beer-pot. And in December, his medical attendant
will make a revelation to him which we earnestly counsel him to take
into his serious consideration. It has nothing to do with tripe or
buttered muffins, but Saturn and Mars are in trine, with, Gamma
Baconis, and everything points at something awful... We make these
revelations with pain, for though ZADKIEL himself has no scruple in
trying to make, the Princesses, uncomfortable, the miseries which he
will himself undergo in 1867 will render him a subject for tolerance and
...” We shall announce the fulfilment of each prediction, and
mark how ZADKIHL bears his fate.
FASHIONABLE BIRDS OF A FEATHER.
According to the Liberté, ladies in Paris have begun to come out in
dresses trimmed all over with feathers, so copiously that:—
“Sportsmen cannot supply them in sufficient quantity. Feathers of the peacock,
partridge, pintado, pheasant, jay, blackbird, and pigeon are all seized with eager-
ness, and even the ducks of the poultry-yard are plucked to satisfy the caprice of
our fashionable ladies.”
An occasion whereon ladies might, appear suitably decorated with
feathers would be a musical assembly. If they took part in it as
vocalists, they might, being feathered all over, be considered as appear-
ing in the character of singing birds. Ducks, indeed, do not sing; but
swans are said to, and a dress covered with swan's plumage would be
suggestive of a song with the burden of Down, derry down. ...But, to
satisfy the caprice of a fashionable lady, the ducks of the poultry-yard
would yield feathers less appropriate than those which might be derived
from the geese.
A Thought in Church.
The income of the excellent ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY—long
may he enjoy it—is £15,000 a-year. If he were travelling, with a year's
income about him, and he were attacked by robbers who took about
eighteen hundred pounds from him, we wonder whether he would

HORACE HALL-RAYS ON THE GREAT DLAMOND
QUESTION.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,
THERE have been loud, and I daresay very just complaints of
the extravagant price of beef and that sort of thing. Not being myself
a family man, however, I am precluded from entering into a pure table-
talk matter like this with so keen a zest as my friends who are more
happily situated. When conversation takes a higher tone, when elo-
quence, eschewing steaks, is fired by stars—not astronomical, but
aristocratic—a sympathetic chord is struck in every noble breast. For,
let me ask, what man of refinement and sensibility can dilate on the
resent F." rice of gems without his voice becoming tremu-
ous with emotion ? ho can stand for an hour in an auction-room,
where jewels are driving competition to madness, and not feel humbled
by his own comparative worthlessness and insignificance * Precious
stones are j down by the irrevocable hammer to a startling
tune. A necklette is “run up” to a figure that a hunter couldn't reach.
For pearls you must dive in your spare cash deeper and deeper still.
A pansy-brooch shall cost you a clump of trees; and in catching a
butterfly you may drop as many ten-pound notes as, judiciously dis-
tributed, would secure you a seat in Parliament.
Sir! this question has a moral as well as a monetary aspect. The
imitative genius of our manufacturers was never more conspicuous than
at this moment. From pictures to pepper, shams confront us on every
side, and it is wonderful how true they are to nature and art. As great
original gems recede from our view, a white light no less than ared
one may come to be regarded by timid men as a signal for caution.
Let me explain. An impulsive Major, lately returned from India, was
attracted by a German Baroness (the relict of an unpopular diploma-
tist), in a ball-room at Wiesbaden. Fascinated by jewels, which he
fondly supposed to be of pure water, my poor friend plunged into the
giddy whirlpool of love, and striking out boldly, soon found himself in
that ridiculous piscatory position which a fishing-line suggests, Madam
being at one end and Major at the other. en too ; he became
conscious that he had acted like a gudgeon, and been caught inglo-
riously with paste.
One word of consolation, and may it yield comfon Y to all who sig
alas! unavailingly for earth's too costly gems. In this favoured lan
may be found many rough diamonds more noted for their sterling
worth than for their shining qualities; but depend upon it our beloved
country will never lose her native lustre so long as she can boast, as
she does now, in countless profusion of those “real brilliants,” Beauty
and Wit. Ever yours,
Cameo Willa, HoRACE HALL-RAYs.

ens that MR. KAVANAGH was born without arms or legs. Nevertheless

a salmon-fisher as MR. BRIGHT, and, in fact, seems to make it doubtful
whether arms and legs are not superfluities. To notice these peculi-
arities, by way of excuse for heartily welcoming MR. KAVANAGH to the
senate is no impertinence on the part of Mr. Punch, who is himself the

HE Blunder of Short Garments. Thou shalt wear
Thy supple thighs in sheaths of splendid fit,
Much use whereof shall surely render bare
The mystery, yea, the very threads of it; .
And cold shall seize thee standing; should'st thou sit,
Thy skin shall vex thee with its tenderness;.
Qr stoop, thy perilous underseam shall split;
This is the end of every man's excess.
The Blunder of Gay Seasons. Strange delight;
Thy seething garb shall cleave to thee, and cling;
Thy red wet palm shall reek beneath the white;
And fierce . shining leather bite and sting,
A future of sore troubles gathering;
The dawn shall send thee ... and comfortless,
Creeping along the kerb, an abject thing.
This is the end of every man’s excess.
The Blunder of MuchMusic. Sit thee down,
Nay, stop thine ears, and sleep. For verily,
She that is playing heedeth not thy frown
And she that singeth takes no thought for thee;
And song shall follow song till thou shalt be
Smitten and bitten with fierce restlessness
To bite and smite in turn, or turn to flee;
This is the end of every man's excess.
The Blunder of Great Banquets. Out of sight,
Beyond the reach of hands that heal for gain,
The dish of thy desire and thy delight -
Shall vex thy sleep. Thou shalt behold again... .
The Lord Knight Mayor, thy host, as King of Pain;
And lo, the worthy Lady Mayoress -
As Queen of Pleasure in thy fond heart shall reign;
This is the end of every man's excess.
The Blunder of Long Speeches. Thou shalt burn
To see men whisper, and thy voice grow thick,
And shame shall stain thee red and white by turn,
And all thy wine shall rise and make thee sick;
And short swift sobs shall take thy breath betw.hicſ
And in thy skull shall be much emptiness,
And in thy stead, the likeness of a stick.
This is the end of every man's excess.
The Blunder of Late Hours. Leave thy sad bed;
See what strange things shall jº thy straining sight:
Stray broken glass to greet the dawn; grey de
Strewn ashes of the weeds of thy delight;
Sicksterile leavings of the hot fierce night;
Yet must thou bend thee to thy business
Thy brain to brood; thy tremulous hand to write;
This is the end of every man's excess.
The Blunder of Strong Spirits; warm and sweet,
Or cold without, and pale; whereof to tread
The wild wet ways is perilous to thy feet,
And in thine eyes, where green was, lo, the red;
And where thy sinew, soft weak fat instead;
Burning of heart, and much uneasiness
About thy girdle, and aching in thine head;
This is the end of every man's excess.
The Blunder of Much Rhyming. If thou write
That once again that should be once for all,
These market-men will buy thy black and white
Till thy keen swift full fervent ways shall fall
On sated ears; thy stinging sweetness pall;
And barren memories of thy bright success
Shall burst in thee the bladder of thy gall;
This is the end of every man’s excess.
The Blunder of Long Ballads. Bide in peace;
For when the night is near, the day shall die,
And when the day shall dawn the night shall cease,
And all things have an end of all; and I
An end of this, for that my lips are dry,
And the eleventh hour's exceeding heaviness
Doth overweigh mine eyelid on mine eye. . .
This is the end of every man's excess.

Poets, who tread the fast and flowerful way,
Heed well the burden these sad rhymes impress;
Pleasure is first, and then the time to pay;

SOLDIERS AND CIGARS.
FRIEND Punch, -
PERAdventure thou hast seen that the Army Re-organisation
Commissioners º that soldiers, after twelve years’ service, should
be tempted to re-en
to their pay, and a retiring pension of 1s: a day.
I think the pay at present actually received, after all deductions, by
a private soldier, amounts to about lºd daily. At that rate the pay,
per diem, of the re-enlisted soldier, would be 343.
Thou didst, peradventure, also see that when the KING or PRUssía
quartered his army on certain provinces which he had seized, he
exacted from their inhabitants a tribute which included, for each
soldier, a large allowance of cigars.
How many cigars dost, thou think, a British soldier could buy for
3\d.” I suppose thou wilt answer, Two penny Pickwicks and a Cuba.
Dost thou think the KING or PRussia would have been satisfied with
the su ply of such cigars to his soldiers? Wouldst thou smoke them
º- -
ow many men, thinkest thou, besides the few who love fighting for
its own sake, are likely to enlist for the price of one Čaba and re-enlist
for the equivalent of one Cuba and three penny Pickwicks a day?
How many, in thine opinion, will the prospect of 7s, a week for their
sustenance in old age allure to resume the occupation of exposing their
viscera and their limbs to be lacerated and crushed by lumps of lead
and masses of iron? Imagine the effect of an Armstrong bolt on thine
own shins.
Methinks, friend Punch, that if the British Army is to be recruited
with a sufficiency of volunteers, they must be encou
the wages as above recommended.
Which if the country cannot afford, it will of necessity have to
submit to a general conscription irrespectively of rank and riches,
which is what the principal nations of the Continent have brought
upon themselves by their glorious victories. Truly that would be a
great calamity, especially for Members of the Society of Friends, even if
they were allowed to buy substitutes, which would be as contrary to
their principles as serving themselves. For a consistent Friend would
refuse to do either; and then, friend Punch, Ifear that grievous perse-
cution would be the lot of thy friend, OBADIAH.
Gone Goose in Venetia.
Poor old Pope . His Holiness scolds Italy for having “destroyed
the Convention stipulated by us with our dear son FRANcis-Joseph,
Emperor of Austria.” A pretty pass that same Convention has
brought our dear son FRANcis-Joseph tol. The Concordat pretty
nearly destroyed the Austrian Empire, and the Holy Father wonders
that it has been destroyed by the Italian Kingdom. The Pope has
many virtues, but by far the most admirable of all his qualities is
simplicity—or a magnificent imitation of it.

A WARD THAT DESERVES watchING.
MR. PUNCH would recommend “funny men,” on or off the stage, to
hear ARTEMUs WARD “speak his piece” at the Egyptian Hall, and
then, in so far as in them lies, to go and do likewise. §.,. y who
is liable to be afflicted by funny men, whether in his business—as dra-
matic author, say,+or in his pleasure (so called), say as theatre-goer
or diner-out, must continually have felt how the dreariness of funny
men is enhanced by the emphasis and effort with which they force their
facetiousness into your face, or dig it into your ribs. The low come-
dian of the second-rate theatre, the comic singer of the music-hall, is
probably the most offensive organ of what is called “amusement,” ever
allowed to outrage good taste, good sense, and good breeding, and to
minister, unreproved, to coarseness, imbecility, and vulgarity. . But
nothing contributes so much to the irritating effect of an “entertainer”
of this deplorable kind, as his way of emphasising his own, fatuous-
ness, and writing himself down an ass in italics. ithout this pecu-
liarity, he would only make us sad: with it, he makes us savage.
Oh, if these unhappy abusers of gag, grimace, and emphasis, these
grating, grinding, grinning, over-doing obtruders of themselves in the
wrong place,—could take a leaf out of ARTEMUs WARD’s “piece,” and
learn to be as quiet, grave, and unconscious in their delivery of the
words set down for them as he is in speaking his own Unlike them,
ARTEMUs WARD has brains. That is, of course, beyond hope in their
case. But if they could once be made to feel how immensely true
humour is enhanced by the unforced way it, drops out of A. W.'s
mouth, they .." learn to imitate what, probably, it is hopeless to
expect they could understand.
o be sure, ARTEMUs WARD's delivery of fun is eminently “un-
English.” But there are a good many things English one would
like to see un-Englished. Gagging, gross, overdone low comedy is one
of them. Snobbishness is another. The two go hand in hand. One
of the best of many good points of ARTEMUs WARD's piece is that it is
quite free from all trace of either of these English institutions. And it
is worth noting, that we owe to another native of the States, Joseph
JEFFERson, the best example lately set us of unforced and natural low
comedy. His Rip Wan Winkle was very un-English, too.
A LITTLE LESSON.
MR. PUNCH is pleased to see that a decoration has been given by the
QUEEN to the Finance Minister of Victoria [Victoria is one of the
Australian colonies, it is at the southern extremity of the continent,
Melbourne is the capital, and the inhabitants are far in advance of
England in regard to civilisation—for instance, they have compulsory
education]. The HoN. GEORGE WERDON came over on a mission to
our Government. Victoria wants an armour-plated ship, for which
she will partly pay, and a training ship, and SIR John PARINGtoN has
assented. The Minister, for his various services to the colony, has
received the Bath Cross. Should it not have been the Victoria Cross P
This little goak is the bit of sugar with which Mr. Punch rewards his
readers for learning more than most English people know about one of
our noblest colonies. If his readers are .. they shall have another
colonial lesson some day. For we have other colonies besides Victoria.
A Good Judge.
SIR HUGH CAIRNs is said to have declined a Peerage which was
offered to him on his elevation to the Bench. If he did, no doubt he
was wise. We may presume that the title which he declines was a
mere barony, which would have been a barren honour.

THE PRESS AND THE LAW.
MR. PUNCH cannot regret the result of MR. Doulton's application
to the Queen’s Bench, touching a remarkably severe castigation which
was awarded to that gentleman by the Daily Telegraph. Much that was
in the article Mr. Punch thinks might well have been omitted. MR.
Doulton had only exercised the right of a Member who scorns to be a
Delegate. , But the remarks, were addressed to Lambeth, and the
writer probably considered the tastes of that quarter, which is not
famous for refinement. Be that as it may, there is far too much en-
couragement given to persons who are irritated by press comments to
avail themselves of the aid of old father Antic, the Law. Instead of
profiting by newspaper counsel, and amending any conduct which is
justly complained of, the chastised individual flies to an attorney, and
too many juries assist the couple in obtaining pecuniary consolation for
a well-deserved punishment. *. jurors are simply stupid asses, and
many others have a fellow-feeling for a man whose tricks of trade they
probably practise, with better luck. For instance, this very Lambeth
is notorious for its crop of rascally tradesmen who cheat the poor with
false weights and measures. MR. THoMAs HUGHES, the Member for
Lambeth, with his accustomed courage, flung the fact right in the
teeth of a meeting of Lambeth-folk the other day, and the report says
that he was hissed. The hissers were probably either scoundrels who
had been fined, or sympathisers with º The ridiculous little
penalties that are inflicted on those who cheat with false weights and
measures are the laughing stock of that class of tradesmen, who pay.
the fine, grin, and recoup themselves, by the same means, in a couple of
days of roguery. Punch would like to see their ears nailed to their
shop-doors, or to a pillory, as he delicately hinted in a recent picture.
The remedy is preposterously weak, and #. is no publication of the
names of the knaves. Consequently, the journalist has a right to speak
out on the part of the public. T.Yet, if Mr. Punch should select a few of
the names of the rascals, and parade them before the public, some
dirty attorney would bring an action against him, and idiotic or dis-
honest jurors would j; be found to give damages to the cheating
scoundrels, though Mr. Punch, who cannot know anything personally
of such fellows, would have acted º in the interest of society. His
remarks, of course, do not apply in the remotest degree to the case of
MR. Doulton, who has shown himself a gentleman of spirit, and also
of sense (except in his ill-advised º at a press prosecution), but
we are glad that he has failed, and Punch will always glad to see a
failure of any endeavours to gag the press, whether such endeavour be
made by an honest politician, in a moment of unwise irritation, or by an
advertising uack writhing under a newspaper lash. The result of the
action by “Doctor.” HUNTER against our ºp. the Pall Mall
Gazette, must delight everyone who honours, the noble profession of
which the plaintiff pretended to be a recognised member, and Mr. Punch
thanks LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE CocKBURN for steadily keeping the facts
before the jury, and Mr. P. also compliments the jury on their exact
appreciation of the value of the plaintiff's professional character.
UNTER got a verdict, damages one farthing, and the public is to be
congratulated on the termination thus put to the medical career of a
man who traded on the ignorant terrors of the afflicted.
SKIRTS AND STREET-SWEEPERS.
STREET-SweepERs and scavengers will rejoice in the prospect of
increasing employment which they may derive from the intelligence,
announced by Le Follet, that—
“As winter costumes make their appearance, short dresses are seen to be more
and more in favour; in fact, for walking dress the trained skirts may be said to be
quite out of date, they are reserved for in-doors or carriage wear.”
Instead of sweeping up the mud, and other yarieties of “matter in
its wrong place,” about the streets, the skirts of ladies will now, it may
be j. sweep clear of those incidental trimmings to the hems of
their garments. A man riding inside of an omnibus, when the female
assengers brush by him, will perhaps no longer be liable to have his
É. anointed with the borders of their trains.
University Intelligence.
Young Oxford appears to be Conservative, not to say reactionary.
Every week we expect to read that the great partiality the men show
for “ coaches” has resulted in a majority at the Union against Rail-
ways; or to hear of a motion being carried in favour of a return to
spade husbandry, by the votes of those undergraduates who are averse
to a “ploughing.”

GREATNESS AND GLORY.
We used continually to read in the news-
papers, and to hear in public speeches, that the
schoolmaster was abroad. Our journalists and
our orators have ceased to tell us that. The
schoolmaster is now no longer abroad. It is
the drill-sergeant who is abroad at present;
abroad and at home, too. “The progress of
civilisation” was, within man's memory, a stock
phrase—a common heading of newspaper para-
aphs.
The newspapers contain few examples, of
the progress in civilisation now. But they
contain, a great many illustrations of the pro-
gress of brutalisation; and here, extracted from
a contemporary, is one of them:-
“THE REsults of WAR.—A Berlin letter says: “The
following is one result of the late Prussian campaign.
Out of a total of rather more than 130,000 Berlin house-
holds 85,000, or 60 per cent., were unable to pay the
house-tax due in July. Add to this the number of families
not subject to this tax in consequence of the lowness of
their rents, and you will have a pretty accurate idea of
the sort of prosperity at present enjoyed by the inha-
bitants of the Prussian capital.’”
In these days, “ tremendous events,” as the
saying is, “succeed one another with such extra.
less, avail. ordinary rapidity,” that the immense event of
one day is put out of mind by that of the next.
he last grand battle swamps the memory of the
one that preceded it, and then its own dies away,
and, except for the few who have gained by it,
nothing of it remains but taxes, grief, and the
| life-long wretchedness of mutilation. Qh yes,
there is one thing more—the consolidation of a
certain number of states into a military monarchy;
which is a fine thing for those who, as MR.
MATTHEW ARNOLD says, have “got Geist.”
There are, perhaps, too many Philistines amongst
the ignoble British vulgar who will say, “Geist
blowed!”
A HINT ON HUMAN CHARCOAL.
THE share and debenture holders of the London, Chatham and
Dover Railway have burnt their fingers, but nothing else; unless, per-
haps, their debentures and shares, as waste paper. There is, however,
another line, on which, though its shareholders may rejoice in having
escaped the fire, certain passengers the other day, if indeed they were
not actually roasted alive for some time, appear to have narrowl
missed being burnt to death. In the Post of Tuesday last you will fin
the statement following:—
And
“A PassFNGER TRAIN on FIRE.-The 10:45 express from Bedford, which runs
through to London, was stopped yesterday morning near Hitchin, owing to one of
the second class carriages taking fire. The passengers were unable to attract the
attention of the i. by their united shoutings, whistlings, and banging of doors
for at least ten minutes, during which time a hole was burnt in the roof, and the
carriage filled with smoke.”
From this account the inference would seem to be that the occupants
of the burning carriage must have been, for the time above specified,
undergoing a culinary process, and that, if they had failed for a little
longer to attract the guard's attention, they would soon have been
done. As, however, the fire was caused by a tarpaulin having been
blown over the lighted oil-lamp, it began in the roof, and raged over
their heads. But when fires occur in railway carriages, they will not
always break out in a convenient situation. Therefore, it is satisfactory
to know that—
“MR. ALLPort, the general Manager of the Midland Railway, was in the train,
and by his prompt exertions the fire was soon extinguished, and the passengers
removed to another carriage.”
If a preventible accidentis to happen to a train, it cannot happen better
than to one which contains the Company's Manager, unless it happens
to one containing the Chairman and the Directors. The Manager of the
Midland Counties will doubtless now take good care to press on the
Direction the necessity of instituting some means of communication be-

“The KING of DAHomey has had another grand sacrifice. According to a letter
from Lagos, of the 19th of October, his Majesty was about to go to war with the
Ashantees, and to propitiate the gods he had ordered 200 men to be put to death.
This is the third sacrifice within the year.”
Well, he is a foul and cruel savage, and we should all rejoice to hear
tween the passengers and the guard. If they think the thing is not to be
done, they are right—because it has been dome; and an apparatus con-
trived for the purpose by MR. PREECE, the electrician, is now in use
on the London and South-Western line. If the other railway com-
É. know of any invention, better than MR. PREECE's, let them
indly give us the benefit of their information; if not, employ that one,
together with the London and South-Western.
that some condemned victim had protested emphatically by cutting off
his Majesty's head. But is Dahomey the only country which sanctions

stories, we are ashamed to say more against the KING or DAHOMEY
than that there is another tyrant called The System, and that we wish
the two Molochs were in the same grave.

me to add to my wardrobe
a Bankruptcy West and a
Commonlawcoat, the latter
for general wear, with a
Conveyancing Wrapper for
the top of the omnibus on
foggy mornings. The price
of these trousers, as given
in the circular, is inexpres-
sibly low, and just fits my
exchequer; but I would
suggest to ... the learned
- Bench of Tailors that they
might find the article take better if offered at a still smaller sum–say,
thirteen-and-fourpence.
What can those shopkeepers mean who by tickets in their windows
try to allure me to buy “French Wrists”? Can we wonder at the
degeneracy imputed to our medical students when a useful portion of
the human frame is thus publicly exposed for sale P. Where are the
professors of Muscular Christianity F. We spend thousands on the
conversion of an occasional cannibal or two in the Pacific Ocean; we
had far better give our attention and money to the hosiers in Totten-
ham Court Road. What I have quoted is it not enough to put our
relations with France out of joint, and to set the two nations by
the ears ? We shall have the B. shopkeepers retaliating with some
such announcement as “English Chests,” if this nefarious traffic is
not immediately stopped., Let the police be instantly instructed to
search the premises of these retailers, where they will probably find
secreted the members of other nations—the Roman nose, the Austrian
lip, the Grecian profile, and the Grand Trunk of Canada.
What can Advertisers mean who tempt me to take houses with
“entertaining rooms”? If Fº #. or St. James's were to let,
such a designation might not be inappropriate, but I do not see how
it can be applied to private residences, unless, indeed, it has reference
to their excellent stories. My friends are few, and my digestion
indifferent, so I rarely go into company, but if what I hear and read
be true, dining rooms are anything but entertaining rooms—rather
chambers of horrors.
Lastly, why do the promoters of public concerts solicit me to take
“Fauteuils” at half-a-guinea, or to go into the “Parterre” with a florin?
Is the English language bankrupt, and the Dictionary in the hands of
assignees? Are “Stalls” only fit for cobs, and canons Are we
roWn. So genteel as to have a soul above “the body of the Hall,” to
eave the “Area” to the Policeman, and be as much ashamed of
“Back Seats” as we are of poor relations and holes in our gloves
A BLUE-CoAT AND BUFF-WAISTcoAT MAN.
A BRUSH BETWEEN BROTHERS.
RECENT intelligence from America includes the announcement that
“the shoeblacks of New York are to have a trial of skill for the cham-
ionship of America.” In what contest?, Professional or pugilistic?
n operations on leather, or in the art of “leathering ” each other? In
blacking shoes or in blacking eyes P Will they compete in polishing
boots one with another, or will they try to polish one another off?
The white shoeblack, being a sort of black that may be said to be
white, is susceptible of a certain polish, which, however, differs from
that effected by the manual art exercised by shoeblacks. According to
Sam Slick, however, this latter species of polish has been brilliantl
developed on the negro skin. Let us hope that it is not the only j
of which our sable brethren are capable.
TOUTING FOR PICTURES.
THE British Public likes nothing better than being on familiar terms
with its favourites. A theatrical audience is perfectly delighted when
any casualty causes an actor to step out of the picture frame and speak
to his generous benefactors in his natural voice. Church-goers who
happen to have the pleasure of being in their pews when the clergyman
utters a few secular words on a bit of parochial business are quite
pleased, and smile at one another and treasure the little incident for
tea-table talk. All of which is very amiable, in its way. But we
really think that some public people go a little too far in cultivating
the private regards of their friends. Look at this notice in a pious
contemporary:—
“THE Editor's Album.—The special friends of the Christian World—both ladies
and gentlemen—are respectfully informed that the Editor will be much gratified to
receive their cartºs-de-visite for his Album ; and that he hopes to be able to make a
collection of several hundreds of them at least.
course, be written on the back of each portrait.”
Now, Mr. Punch discharges his editorial functions in his own way,
and begs to disclaim any idea of interfering with the course which his
Name and address should, of
Christian brother, above-mentioned, may deem wise. But Mr. Punch
earnestly prays and entreats that the Special Friends of Punch (that is
to say the world at large) will not j that he, also, would like to be
favoured with the photographs and autographs of his admirers. Fleet
Street already presents blocks enough, thanks to empty cabs and the
Van Demons, but what would it be if an extra thousand parcels were
delivered every day ? And what would become of the Post, Office
while the men of the DUKE OF -
toiling under the additional myriads of letters to No. 85? Setting
aside this view of the case, which is exceptional, and could occur only
in regard to Punch, he puts it to his friend the Editor of the Christian
World, whether an Editor gains by seeing the likenesses of his corre-
spondents. Some of the best of writers are tºº. ugly, while
many elegant men and adorable women send rubbish. Even an Editor
is human, and might, be inclined to read unfavouringly the MS. of a
arty who looked like a snob, while as unwise a tenderness might be
felt for a pleasant-looking swell, or a charmingly-depicted young lady:
Again, *: should an Editor have a contributor's likeness? To aid
the police in case the contributor bolts, after cheque, without sending
his article 2 That is practical, but we should care little for a contri-
bution extorted while Z 365 was at the writer's elbow. But does the
Editor of the C. W. give soirées, at which his photograph books are
handed round with f tea? We hope better things of a fellow-
craftsman. We, at least, hold no such spoony re-unions. Fancy any
of Punch's fellows, or his darling she-fellows, sending their cartes-de-
visite, to be inspected over claret and through smoke. Truly, their
ears would tingle at the candour with which their lineaments would be
remarked upon. However, if the C.W. does give soirées, we shall be
obliged by an invitation. A deputation from Punch shall attend, and
a report may be relied upon.

Dr. Bull. The old Irish complaint with a new name. The urticaria
Feniana is essentially the same disease as the Irish nettle-rash which
has been so long endemic in the Isle of Breakings-out.
Dr. Slop. It is a very troublesome disorder.
Dr. Dulc. Very obstinate, indeed; seems to have become almost

Dr. Bull. In fact, it is a malignant º Well, gentlemen; but
what are we to do with this case? You know what the old treatment

Dr. Dulc. The time for that very active treatment has gone by.
Dr. Bull. Humph! I hope it is not to come:
Dr. Slop. Principiis obsta. I recommend palliatives.
Dr. Dulc. I concur in that recommendation.
Dr. Slop. And in the first place I would remove that excrescence,
which creates so much irritation—that ecclesio-sarcoma.
Dr. Bull. It is rather unsightly. But it is not at the root of the
disease; and it has such important connections, that its removal,
whilst it would probably do little or no good, would certainly do more
or less harm. - - - -- -
Dr. Dulc. One peculiarity of this disease is analogous to an occa-

Dr. Dulc. You consider the disease contagious?
Dr. Bull. Certainly, and the susceptibility of it is especially peculiar
to the Irish system, irrespectively of climate. It rages violently
among the Irish in America. The infected who arrive here propagate
it afresh. I mean first to deal with them, and stamp it out, # possible,
as I did the Cattle Plague.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ºf HAMPSTEAD HEATH TO THE RESCUE!
HERE seems to have
occurred an extra-
ordinary case, of
smuggling. Witness
the following por-
paragraph :-
“BUILDING on HAMP-
stEAD HEATH.-Yester-
day the attention of the
Marylebone Westry was
drawn to the fact that
SIR THoMAs MARyos
Wilson had commenced
building huts on the
best part of Hampstead
Heath, to be let on
short leases of twenty-
one years.”
Does, them, the
popularly-received
story that SIR
THoMAs, ... WILsoN
was inhibited by his
father's will from
building on Hamp-
stead Heath, turn
out to be a myth
If not, surely some
Bill, which em-
powered him to convert that open space into slums, must have been very
craftily smuggled through Parliament. . If, such a Bill was necessary,
and has not ‘. obtained, what law is there to hinder the \;
of Marylebone from proceeding to demolish the odious hovels whic
SIR. T.M. WILson is disfiguring Hº! Heath with ?
According to a correspondent of the Times, a part of Hampstead
Heath is also in course º conversion into brickfie ds. Parts of it, in
loads of sand, are being carted away. by Railway. Contractors, the
Despoilers General of England's sanctity and beauty, Between SIR
Thomas Wilson and those other Vandals, Hampstead Heath, unless
their havoc is arrested, will soon be converted into a wilderness such
as Wilderness Row. -
The fact, to which the attention of the Marylebone Westry has been
drawn, that SIRTHoMAs MARYon WILSON has commenced the abo-
lition of Hºº Heath, is one to which, with shrieks and screams
of alarm, we hasten to direct the notice of all London. Hampstead
Heath, no doubt, has its price, and if WILSON could obtain that, which
he has a right to claim, might be redeemed from the ravager.
COOKS AND CREEDS.
No obliging Correspondent sent us this advertisement. We found
it out for ourselves in the Bath Chronicle:–
W ANTED, by a small family in the country, a thoroughly Good
PLAIN COOK, not under 28 years of age, and of the Church of England, to
undertake soups, made dishes, &c.
The question that occurs to us is, Why a Member of the Church of
England? What has a cook's creed to do with her cookery For that
matter, a cook is generally held to be without much religion, and BEN
Jonsos, in the Alchemist, has put the matter somewhat plainly:-
“The place he lives in, still about the fire,
And fume of metals that intoxicate
The brain of man, and make him prone to passion.
Where have you greater Atheists than your Cooks?”
! But, waiving this view, we incline to infer that the person who
wants a Church of England cook has an idea that in Dissenting house-
holds there is less attention to the refinements and luxuries of creature
comforts than in the dwellings of the orthodox; and that a cook who
knows the Assembly's Catechism is likely to be less accomplished than
one who answers “M. or N. as the case may be.” Now we beg to
inform the advertiser and the world that this is a vulgar error. We
have dined, during the moribund year, with many Dissenters, and we
have much pleasure in stating that the dinner a la Russe, and all the
comforts and extravagances of orthodoxy are to be found in full bloom
on the tables of schism. Finer claret, at a hundred and twenty, than
was given us last week by a jovial Independent, we do not desire to
taste, and a Baptist friend º ours has some still champagne which is a
precious deal better than that of our friend, the Bishop of BELDRAGON,
and so we tell him. The Dissenters are fº in, fast, for all the
elegancies, and we rather suspect that it will be the thing, one of these
days, among epicureans, to cultivate sectarian Amphitryons. Church-
men had better look to their reputations. Meantime, noticing that at
Bath the old prejudice lingers, Punch feels it his duty to propagate
more catholic sentiments. Art has no nation, and cookery no creed.
- |
tion of a newspaper H
|ring,
CAN YOU FORGIWE HIM 9
My DEAR MRs. GRUNDY,
I AM a young bachelor, and have a handsome face and figure,
and (what some people may think of vastly more importance) a hand.
some fortune also. It is not very surprising therefore that the pleasure
of my company is pretty frequently requested by ladies who have
daughters of a marriageable age. There is a fable, I believe, about the
eir and many friends. For myself, I find my friends (so at least they
please to call themselves) have daily been increasing since I came into
my property; and none of them appear more anxious to maintain their
friendly footing in my house than the ladies I have mentioned, who
have daughters to provide for. To these good people it appears to be
a matter of astonishment that I have not a wife. } my ears were only
long enough I should doubtless hear them whispering their wonder at
my wretchedness. “So fine a property, my dear, and so fine a person
too, it is really most surprising our young friend is still a bachelor.”
But the fact is, my dear Madam, my wild oats are not all sown; and I
have no wish to be a slave of the ring just at present. That there are
pleasures in a married life I don’t mean to deny; but allow me to
observe, that there are pleasures in a single one. You see, one has at
least the pleasure to do just what one pleases; and husbands as a rule
are seldom left at liberty to do the things they like. . If one stays out a
bit late, one has no fear of being lectured for it; and though a sweetly
smiling face undoubtedly is pleasant to behold on coming home, there
are few things more unpleasant than to see a sour or sulkyone. Besides,
a wife is certainly a most expensive luxury, and costs more than a
yacht, say, or a couple of good hunters. My ocket, it is true, is
tolerably well furnished; but there are many id: comforts which, I
fear, if I were married, I should for prudence sake find it were needful
to deny myself. Cigars that cost a shilling, each are vastly pleasant
smoking, but a married man is hardly justified, Ifancy, in consuming
very many of them. Besides, most women hate smoke, although the
may not like to say so (at least while they are single); and how can
be sure that, when I wanted half a whiff, my devoted little wife would
not act as a tobacco-stopper.
But the thing that most deters, me from committing, social suicide
and bringing to a close my bachelor existence, is, the difficulty that f
feel in knowing something of the girl with whom my life is to be
linked, before I pop the fatal question. Except on very rare occasions,
young fellows such as I am can only hope to meet young ladies at a
party or a pic-nic, when they are pretty sure to be in their best dresses
and best tempers and demeanours. Now, the social treadmill often
claims me for a turn, but one cannot spend one's life in going out to
arties; and before I make an offer, I should like to see how AGNEs
ooks on her off-nights, and whether she is very yellow in the morning.
I want to see her in her sulks a bit, as well as in her silks, and to find
out if her temper be, as º: at home as when she is out visiting.
Living º at a club, as I am privileged to do, I am unable to make
these needful observations, and I have no kind female friend on whom
I can rely to go and make them for me. When I am staying at a
house where there are marriageable daughters, they are on their good
behaviour from breakfast until bed-time, and I rarely get a chance of
seeing what their real habits are. If Mammas would only let their
daughters be more natural, and less formal and constrained by what is
termed good breeding, a young fellow such as I am would more easily
be smitten by them. I would willingly forego half the parties I get
cards for, if people would allow me to take them in the rough, and
without a formal bidding, to look in when I liked. Only, if I chance
unluckily to call some day when AGNEs was, in a dowdy dress, or had
her temper slightly ruffled, I fear, when my knock came she would not
be “at home to me.
As a wife is chiefly wanted for domestic purposes, it is surely a
mistake that men should only be allowed to inspect their future help-
mates when they are least domestic. Girls gorgeous in a ball-room are
quite other creatures from girls dowdy in a breakfast-room, and with
their back-hair badly brushed. A partner for life should not be chosen
lightly, like a partner for a polka. The qualities, one most desires to
see united in a wife are by no means what one looks for in a girl one
wants a waltz with. Let me see how AGNEs behaves herself at home
in the bosom of her family, before I ask her leave to take her to my
own manly breast. Depend on it, dear Madam, could young men only
see young ladies in the daytime, while doing their home duties, and
not pranked out for a party, there would be far more happy marriages
and far fewer of those unhappy ones, wherein proposals made in ball-
rooms so frequently result.
Pray then, my dear lady, do put forth your utmost influence to en-
courage homely visits for the purposes of love-making; and meanwhile
pray believe me, your most devoted Servant, but no slave yet of the
CROEsus NARcissus CoeleBs SoLoN SMITH.
LookING Forward-A Man we know kept his bed the night of the
great star and meteor shower, but he has since made an appointment
at Greenwich Observatory for next generation.

HAPPY THOUGHTS.
GET into the gig, and leave the Station. Very cold. At first starting
it seems a brightish might. Getting away from the Station (where the
gas is on, which is all the difference), it is pitch dark.
Happy Thought.—I think of the word “pitch,” and hold on by the
rail at the side of my seat. Feels unsafe. Always feel unsafe when
being driven. -
Happy Thought—What must others feel when I’m driving them?
Recollect I once did drive some one through a lane, in Devonshire,
in the dark, I say “some one:” I now forget who he was, as I never
saw him again. Drove him and every one up against a wall, which I
thought was the continuation of the road. Recollect driving once
again in Devonshire, after dinner, by moonlight. We walked the
horse, so as to be particularly careful. Drove him up a bank, which I
thought wasn’t a bank, and upset everybody, with a boot full of rabbits
which we’d shot, and three guns. Didn't drive again in Devonshire,
except once more in broad daylight, when I tried to turn a corner very
neatly. I recollect, on that occasion, one fellow went into a green
mud pond, and was laid up for three weeks, and the other fellow dis-
appeared over a hedge, and said he wasn't hurt much. The driver
ways falls easier than the others; at least, I did.
I wish I hadn’t recollected all these things.
Happy Thought.-Unfasten the apron, so as to be ready.
Talk to the man in order to give him confidence, and not to let him
think I'm afraid. I observe to him, “It’s very dark.” He observes,
“No, it ain’t,” which doesn’t promise well for a sustained con-
versation. I think we’re turning a corner, by the feeling of being at
some sort of an angle with the hand-rail, but I can’t see. Whatever
it is, we’re safe again, and (I think) on a straight road.
The horse stumbles. I suggest he'd better “hold him up.” Hate
careless driving, specially in the dark. Man, who is well wrapped up,
replies from behind a high coat-collar and comforter, and from beneath
a hat (which three things are all, I can see of him), “He’s all right.”
Man is sulky : perhaps been called out of bed to drive me to Bovor
Castle, and doesn’t like it. I shouldn't.
Happy Thought.—Be kindly towards him. Hint at the possibility of
his having a warm drink on the road, if he’ll only drive carefully.
Happier Thought—To give it him at the end of the journey, not at
the beginning. He might get excited.
In a dark, narrow lane. I say, as pleasantly as possible, “Nasty
place, this; can't pass many things here,” by which P. to convey
that if any other vehicle was meeting us, one of the two would be in
the ditch. He admits, with reserve, “No, there ain't much room.”
He doesn't seem to know what he should do if another vehicle comes.
I wonder (to myself) if I could jump into the hedge. Something is
coming. No. Yes. No. Horse stumbles again. I laugh, and, not
liking to give advice to a professional driver, say, “He wants a
holding up, eh?” Man replies, gruffly, “No, he don't.” From
tone I gather that he won't take advice. Stars are appearing, as it
seems to me.
Happy Thought—Looking at the stars (it is clearer now), Iremember
how African travellers in the deserts, or jungles, or prairies, or some-
where where nobody is, except occasionallions and tigers, guide them-
selves by the stars. Wonder how they do it. M. Du CHAILLU in his book ||
says he did it. I suppose it requires a thorough knowledge of the
Heavenly Bodies. At present the only Heavenly Body I know is the
Great Bear; which, by the way, is about as much like a bear as-as-say
a poker. [That’s where I fail, in simile.] If I looked at the Great Bear,
I wonder where I should get to at last.
see other stars and lights. This would be very puzzling. Sailors, steer
by the stars. It must be very difficult to find which way to turn at
Sea.
America. Well, that can’t be easy to find at any time—specially
at night. At least, I’ve always thought so, looking at it from Brighton.
These thoughts distract me from my present danger. I don’t
know that there is any danger, but I feel as if there was. Horse
stumbles. Man informs me that “We’re going down a rather stee
hill.” Odd, I don't know it. But why doesn't i. “hold him up” P
ask. He replies, “He doesn't want, any holding up.” He says, “he
knows the horse well enough.” So do I by this time: a beast. Driving
on. Another corner. The driver is rather rash at corners, but steady
in the straight road. I feel I should like to say to him, “Don’t try to
drive so dashingly.” But perhaps it will only irritate him.
I want to pull his right rein when he’s going round a left-
hand corner. Perhaps I make matters worse by interference.
Shall be glad when this is over.
“Where,” I ask, “is the Castle?” He answers. “Oh, that ain’t
here: this is Beckenhurst, this is.” “Well,” I say, “we’ve come
two miles, and the station was Beckenhurst.” He corrects me, with,

evidently, the clear knowledge of a native, “No, that’s Beckenhurst
Station ; this is Beckenhurst village.”
“What, all this?” I ask, alluding to the distance we’ve alread
| travelled. He informs me, with his whip pointing straight forward,
and then from left to right, at the hedges, “Yes, all this: Bovor’s a
matter of four mile from here.” -
I tell him that they said it was only four miles from Beckenhurst
Station: which notion seems to amuse him behind his collar and
comforter, and under his hat.

is: therefore, he may be wrong. Y. but wrong which way? Is it
more or less than four miles? I ought to have asked at the station
how much a mile the fly charges here. This is just one of those
occasions when I want }. of mind. I think of these things,
just like my repartees and similes, a quarter of an hour after I ought
to have said them.
Happy Thought.—To º I know the road: then he won't
impose on me. I do recollect having been in this neighbourhood, or
at all events in Kent, when I was a child. I observe, with decision,
“Oh, it’s not more than four miles” it doesn't seem to make very
much difference to him, so perhaps they charge here by the hour.
don’t like to ask him to drive fast; and yet if he dawdles for the sake
of running up a bill, I shan’t get to Bovor Castle, until, perhaps,
one o’clock'in the morning, when everyone’s fast asleep.
Unhappy Thought.—Supposing I can’t get in P Because, hang it, as
my telegram has not arrived, they don’t expect me. If I do get in,
p'raps they won’t have got a bed. House full, perhaps. I put this
case to the driver, and add, “I suppose (as a matter of course) that I
can easily get a bed at the Hotel.” #. asks, gruffly, “What Hotel?” I
say, “Why, at Bovor.” This amuses him under his wrapper, as before,
and he observes presently, “There ain't no Hotel.” I think he's
stickling for names, and putting too fine a point (so to speak) upon it;
so I explain that when I say Hotel, I mean village Inn. He answers
me, displaying some little petulance, “There ain't no village :” adding,
as a consequence, “and there ain't no Inn.” “No Inn'.' I exclaim.
I hardly like asking after this if there is a Castle. , Supposing it should
be only a practical joke of CHILDERs 2 Impossible.
“If the worst comes to the worst,” I say, “I can get a bed at the
hotel at Beckenhurst, then P” He is doubtful about this, as they’re
sure to be closed, being so late.
THappy Thought.—This flyman comes from some stables; the stables
belong to an inn, of course. I put this to him, thus, that “if the worst
does come to the worst, I can get a bed at his inn. He extinguishes
all hope in this quarter by telling me that “his master only lets out
horses and flys.”
I hope to goodness CHILDERs will be up. He used to be a great
º . town for sitting up late. Perhaps in the country he goes to
early.
Happy Thought.--Dismiss anxiety, and obtain information about the
country from the driver.
I ask him about the crops. He doesn't know much about crops.
“Any floods?” I inquire. He’s not heard of any.
Happy Thought.-Get some statistics from him about Cattle Plague.
I ask him “if he's had much Cattle, Plague here.” He is angry and
returns that he hasn’t had no Cattle Plague.” He thinks I’m laugh-
ing at him. These country º are very tetchy. I tell him politely,
that I don't mean that he's had the Cattle Plague (though he’s ass
enough for anything, but I don't say this), but ſwant to know has it
been bad here.” He hasn’t heard as it has.”
Perhaps he's "got some information about the antiquities of the
county. No he hasn't. “Bovor Castle's very old,” I suggest, to
draw him out. He “supposes as it is.” I ask . How old?” He
don't know; but it’s been there ever so long. “Is he acquainted
with MR. ChILDERs 2 * “No he ain't.”
He, won't be drawn out. It is lighter now. The moon shines.
Delightful night to arrive at an old Feudal Castle. I imagine to
myself a grand entrance: Gothic or Norman arches : [Happy Thought.
Get up my architecture.] a fine old bridge, a large massive gate, with
an iron rod at the side, which moves a deep toned bell on the arrival
of a guest. Or perhaps, a horn hung up outside wherewith to summon
the warder. Shall read Ivanhoe again. We go downhill.

idiotcy and thoughtlessness of our Norman ancestors. I wonder if they
ever arrived late at night and couldn't get in. I will descend.
Happy Thought.—To doubt the honesty of this country driver. If I
descend, he may drive off with my luggage; and I shall never see him
again. In fact, as he has been behind his wrapper, coat-collar, and
underneath his hat, I haven’t seen him yet, and couldn’t swear to him
in a Court of Law.
Happy Thought.--To make him get down and drag my luggage out,
while I stand at the horse's head. Good. But what's next?' Here’s
my Fº box, desk, bag, hat-box, rugs, dressing-case, and how

the gate, and carries my portmanteau across the field. Following him
with my eyes, I ſº become aware of a building in the distance,
across apparently two fields, by moonlight. Not my idea, at present,

REFLECTIONs, CYNICAL AND COMMERCIAL.
BY SIR MUNGO MALAGROWTHER.
CHARACTER is formed by circumstances—some say. I deny it.
Look at the turf, how green it is but does it impart any verdure to
those whose grand stand is upon it? Go from the turf to the bank.
Some simpletons suppose that all who get up a bank must necessarily
have lofty views. Pshaw! A bank has natural attractions for men
with a keen scent, and who don't mind little slips in trying to secure
their summum bonum-cent. per cent. I know a bank (it is not that
whereon the wild thyme grows). People shouted “Look at the mint
there!”, and straightway a rush took place to get up the bank. Of
. there was a ditch at the bottom, and every man of them put his
oot in it.
Turning aside from banks, let us look at rails. Women and childre
with here and there a country parson, fancy that everything connecte
with rails) must be perfectly straightforward. I §: so once, but
my faith was shaken in travelling from London to Chatham and Dover.
Rails, I have lately discovered, are carried out in very crooked ways,
and those who lay down the sleepers are themselves remarkable for
being very wide awake. Rolling stock, like rolling stones, gather
sometimes but little moss, and those who have leant heavily upon it,
too often lose their balance. -
I am about to make an original remark, and expect to be ridiculed
and reviled—by those who never take up either an opinion or a news-
paper until it has been aired. Public confidence, like an eel, has won-
derful vitality. It may be fearfully cut up, but its power of voluntary
motion is not"annihilated. ...Perhaps, like its prototype, according to
popular tradition, it rather likes to be stripped of its outer integument
alive. When put over, the glowing fire of Chancery, at the final
winding-up, it wriggles about a little, but gradually becomes reconciled
to the rarefied atmosphere, and is obedient to the call of the chef de
cuisine. What conclusion, then, am I driven to ? This, in plain prose—
that being frizzled, yourself does really afford º as much pleasure as
cooking accounts for your most trusting friends.
From banks and rails a short cut brings us to the Commons. There
is some talk—a large sum-about putting the fences further back.
You needn't walk far to meet wiseacres who are for removing them
altogaher. These fences no doubt keep out many a †. goose, and
hence arises a deal of angry cackle. I hate cackle, and shall be thank-
ful if a limited number ... receive a general invitation to come
in with their bills. A green goose, inspired by this charming thought,
addressing his equals, exclaimed in my hearing,
“'Tis sweet to think that Bright eyes mark our coming,
And will look brighter when we come !"
'Sweet-stuff! Did you ever see any that wasn't coloured with poison
and trash *
To a Retiring L. C. J.
FAREwBLL, kind WILLIAM ERLE!
Though your wig go out of curl,
And moth upon your scarlet cloth may gnaw with hungry jaws
Let Punch your scutcheon fix:

Justice's nobler Essence with the Spirit of the laws.

OLD BROWN,
WHO, THANKS TO THE ADMIRABLE ARRANGEMENTs of THE SOUTH-EASTERN CoM-
PANY, HAs JUST ENDURED THE HoRRORs of A Twelve HouRs' PAssage FROM
BouloGNE, DoES NOT APPRECIATE THIs customARY JOKE AT ALL.
A CASE OF REAL DISTRESS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
THERE are some folks in the world who can’t let other folks
alone, and, unluckily for me, my friend MRs. CUDDLEwell happens to
be one of them. She is jºi must own, a most estimable woman:
as a wife and as a mother, her behaviour is most admirable; but I can-
not i. I think she is quite faultless as a friend. She is, however,
sensible enough to read Punch pretty regularly, and that is why I beg
of you to let me say a word or two º: the way in which she worries
me, and other nice young men with whom she happens to be intimate.
She may relent from teasing, when she sees herself in print.
A better creature hardly can exist than MRs. CUDDLEwell, but her
fault is that she never can be friendly with a fellow without doing all
she can to make a married man of him. She is for ever preaching little
sermons on the benefits of wedlock, and showing how, to her view, it is
selfish in a man to attempt to live a bachelor after he is thirty. From
that age until sixty, no single man is safe with her. , You may be sure
when you receive an invitation to her house, that she wants to intro-
duce you to some “charming girl” or other. Her house is certainly a
pleasant one, and you are sure to meet nice people there; but, lown
these “ ...i girls” have well nigh frightened me away from it. f
like croquet well enough, but it becomes a precious bore when one is
asked to play it daily for some five hours at a stretch, and with always
the same “charming girl” selected for one's partner. I like a pic-nic
very well, but I also like variety; and this is not attainable when one
has a “charming girl.” confided to one's care, and special steps are
taken to prevent one's being civil to any other charmer. Like a cat
upon a mouse, MRs. CUDDLewELL keeps constant watch upon a single
man, and pounces on him in a moment if she ever finds him straying
from the girl she has picked out for him. She is constantly inventing
the most delightful opportunities for fellows to make love, and planning
those snug tete-à-tetes which are so likely to provoke it. Her garden
and conservatory are full of quiet nooks where there is a seat for two,
and every seat placed there may be regarded as a man-trap.
THE QUACK'S FARTHING.
WHENEVER a thief doth come to grief
In his attempt to plunder: . .
With heart and voice we do rejoice,
And shout hurrah like thunder.
The rascally quacks, how wroth they’ll wax,
And howl with fear and fury,
When they peruse, in the public news,
The award of a British ury!
Crying—“Out on the British Jury!
Confound that British Jury!
We can no more,
Rely, as of yore, ...
On the brains of a British Jury.
Time was, a Quack did the Press attack,
When he brought his legal action;
And twelve fools gave, the dirty knave,
| A swingeing satisfaction.
Which counsel's jaw, if he go to law,
No longer will secure : he
May sue in vain, or a farthing gain,
The award of a British Jury.
Crying, &c.
He must bear the lash, or lose his cash,
For his lawyer's bootless trouble;
| And besides he may have costs to pay,
His loss which will redouble.
Sing hey for the Judge, who is up to fudge,
| And my LoBD CHIEF JUSTICE, you’re he ;
| Having ruled that a Quack, exposed, should lack
The award of a British Jury.
Crying, &c.
Statistics of Penal Discipline.
Six garotters were flogged the other day at Newgate, in
the presence of the prison authorities. Their names were
HENRY WILsoN, CHARLEs EveRETT, MICHAEL MACK,
DAVID BENJAMIN, GeoRGE, NAIN, and WILLIAM WHITE.
|Their united ages, amounted to 157 years, the sum, total of
the number of lashes they received was 145, and they will,
collectively, retire into 40 years of penal servitude.
A SMILING CountENANCE is “The Happy Mien.”
Now, falling in love is one thing, but pitfalling is another. , A man
dislikes the thought of being trapped into a marriage. . Let “charming
girls” by all means be asked to meet young fellows, but let the men
alone to profit by the meeting. A man is º sure to find a wife
when he desires one; and nothing is more likely to deter him from a
marriage than to be continually advising him to marry. He naturally
feels frightened, and as timid as a hare, when he finds that he is hunted
by a pack of marriers. -
Hoping MRs. CUDDLewELL, and all the other match-makers, will
take the hint I proffer them, allow me to subscribe myself,

CoMMUNICATED.—The report of a
split in the Cabinet arose out of a con-
versation at Tattersall's concerning
the Derby “crack.”
What says the blue-book?—
THE BLACK COUNTRY.
IS IT AS BLACK AS MR. PUNCH HAS PAINTED IT?
SoME lines in our last number called “The QUEEN in the Black
Country”, have, it seems, given pain to certain susceptible inhabitants
of Wolverhampton.
One lady returns our last week's number to the publishers, as un-
worthy to be bound up in this year's volume, on account of an article
. ing “so much ignorance and ill-feeling,” as she finds in the
lines above referred to.
Mr. Punch is not sorry that his arrow has gone home : that it has
not only inflicted a wound, but rankled there. He would rejoice if not
| Wolverhampton only, or Birmingham, or Dudley, or Bilston, but
all the Black Country, from end to end, could be roused to indignation
by his lines, provided that the indignation did not stop there: that it
roused those who felt it to inquiry and thought; to look in the face
the ignorance, vice, overwork of children, disease and degradation
round about them; to measure the evil and to set about its amend-
ment in right earnest., Mr. Punch is only sorry that his picture of the
Black Country should be so true. He did not make either his colours
or, his subject; he found both., Compare his picture with this in the
sober official Report on the Trades in the Wolverhampton, district—a
Report made !" two º, ago—for the Children's Employment
Commission, by MR. F. D. LONGE:—
“The large working population of this district are peculiarly isolated from the
rest of society. All the large employers live far away from the workpeople whom
they employ. A few ministers of religion are almost the only representatives of the
upper class resident in the ‘Black Country.” No one, unless compelled by duty or
necessity, resides in a district from which nature has been so roughly excluded.
Huge, ugly heaps of refuse, spoil from the pits, or cinder from the iron-furnaces,
cover the whole surface of the country, to the very doors of the houses in which
its denizens live, while smoke issuing, night and day from hundreds of furnaces,
shuts out the sun and stifles what little vegetation the few patches of soil left
unoccupied by buildings or rubbish might afford. Although conditions of life such
as these would seem very unfavourable to the development of either refinement or
intelligence, the industrial occupations of these districts undoubtedly offer less impedi-
ments to the education of the young than those of many other places."
Does this last sentence lighten the sorrowful impression left on us
by the description which precedes it? Hardly.
Mr. Punch spoke of the excessive hours of youthful labour, as
stunting the bodies and souls of the children condemned to it.
º
“The peculiarity of the employment of many of their children and young
persons and women is that in the blast-forges, and in the mills and forges, large
numbers of children and youths are employed in ‘night-sets,' between 6 P.M. and
6 A.M., and that in the miscellaneous trades overtime is very common, a great
number of children, young persons, and women working the same long hours as the
men from 6 or 7 A.M. to 9, 10, and 11 P.M.; among them little girls are often kept at
bellows-blowing (very hard work for children) fourteen hours a-day: the work on
Saturday afternoons being in but few cases abridged, and the work towards the end
of the week being generally much increased in duration, in consequence of the habit
of the men of idling on Moudays, and occasionally a part or the whole of the
Tuesdays also.”
Mr. Punch has given offence by saying that many of these over-
worked little toilers know as little of a Queen as of a God.
As to their knowledge of a God let the blue-book bear its witness,
MR. White's Evidence on the Birmingham District.—“Of very many the state of
mind as regards the simplest facts of religion is dark almost beyond belief. It is
not too much to say that to many God, the Bible, the Saviour, a Christian, even a
future state, are ideas entirely or all but unknown. God is “a good man,' or ‘the
man in Heaven.' 'I've heered that (Christ) but don't know what it is.' Nor do
others know ‘where he lives," or ‘about the world being made,' or ‘who made it,'
or of the Bible—“It is not a book.” “Had not heard of Christ ; I had not done my
work till so late.’ ‘Have heard about Jesus Christ, but it's so long since that I've
forgot.’ ‘Don’t know if I am a Christian, or what it is, or means, but all people are so."
Heaven was heard of only “when father died long ago; mother said he was going
there.' Some think that “bad and good go there alike,” or on the other hand, that
‘them as is wicked shall be worshipped, that means small all go to hell: or, again,
that when people die, ‘they be buried, bain't they 2—their souls as well as their
bodies.” “All go in the pit-hole, when them be buried; they never get out alive
again; they have not a soul; I have not one.’ ‘The soul does not live afterwards;
it's quite an end of people when they die.’ ‘The devil is a good person; I don't
know where he lives.” ‘’Christ was a wicked man.'”
For their knowledge of the QUEEN, let MR. White's report vouch—
“As many as 32 persons averaging over 12 years each, and including a young
man of 20, and 3 girls or young women, one of 18 and two of 17, could not tell
the Queen's name. Q. “Is it Victoral A 2' A. “Oh, no ; I don't know what I hears
of so.” ‘’Can't understand them things.’ Some did not know of her existence;
others showed a dark and lately-got glimmering, by such answers as that ‘she is
the Prince Alexandra,’ ‘is the Prince of Wales,' ' him and her got married,’ ‘she
belongs to all the world,' and so on. Indeed a question about the Queen when
put was scarcely ever answered. These 32 persons were in a variety of work-
places and occupations; 28 of them in Birmingham, 1 at West Bromwich, and 3
tº: º eldest of them 16, near Stourbridge. Very few, indeed, of them were
under 11.’”
The Assistant-Commissioner goes on :-
“This however is merelyipart of a wider general ignorance shown by large

numbers. Of the commonest and simplest objects of nature, flowers, birds, fishes,
rivers, mountains, sea, or of places such as London, &c., or England, or other
countries out of it, or how to get there, many knew little or nothing. London is a
county, but also “is in the exhibition.' Ireland is “a little town.'...A violet is ‘a
retty bird'; lilac is a bird’; ‘believe I would know a primrose: it's a red rose
ike.” “Don’t know if a robin red-breast is a bird, or if it flies or sings' ; ‘don't
know what a river is, or where the fishes are’; ‘a mountain would be in the water
I should think”; “don’t know where the snow falls from, or whether it comes from
the clouds or sky, or where’; ‘the sea is made of land, not of water.'. A picture of
a cow being milked is shown ; “he's a lion." A map is incomprehensible to a
young man of 20, who thinks that “the sun is in the north, or the middle of the day;
mo, it sets in the north.' Even women sometimes are unable to tell the clock."
But it may be said these are isolated cases of special stupidity. Hear
MR. WHITE again:—
“out of 80 girls of from 7 to 16 from one factory, 72.5 per cent admitted they
could not read; 1375 practically could not; 12-5 could read a little; 125, i.e., one
girl, could read effectually."
Mr. Punch accused the conditions of labour, and the greed of gain
in the Black Country, with blighting lives as they blight vegetation, and
with driving their iron plough over souls and bodies.
For souls, let such extracts as those above, quoted from the latest
official inquiry, speak. - -
For what concerns bodies, let us, call into Court, DR, GREENHow
the inspector charged by the Medical Department of the Privy Council
to inquire into the effect of occupations on health (in 1860 and 1861).
In his inquiry into the Wolverhampton district, DR. GREENHow tells
us that—
“The rate of mortality from pulmonary disease in Wolverhampton, both in adults
and in persons of all ages and either sex, is considerably above the standard rate,
an excess which, as regards the adult mortality at least, may with perfect truth be
largely attributed to circumstances connected with the individual occupations of the
inhabitants.”
As regards souls and bodies taken together, the Children's Employ:
: Commissioners (in their Report of 1864) come to this general
Conclusion :-
“That the system of night-sets in the blast furnaces, and in the mills and forges;
the frequent overtime in the foundries, and other miscellaneous occupations of the
district, and the state of many of the places of work are causes of injury to the
health of the young employed in such great numbers, and occasion material ob-
struction to them in regard to their education, has been amply shown by the above
review of the evidence upon these subjects; and the conclusion plainly suggested
by these facts is, that as far as it is practicable to apply remedies by legislation, it
would be desirable to do so.”
Mr. Punch has no wish to
- - - - º: the “Black Country” blacker than
it is, The question, suggested by the Report he has been quoting, is
whether it be possible to paint it blacker than the black reality. He
is thankful to know, however, that black as this country is now, it was
blacker once; and that, however grim, gloomy, and depressing be the
picture to be made out of the materials furnished by the Report of 1864,
it is light and hope itself compared with that to be gathered from MR.
HoRNE's and DR, MITCHELL’s reports made for the original Children's
Employment Commission in 1841.
There has been an improvement among the workers even in this sad
and unlovely region, thanks to the influence of enlightened minds and
lives of Christian effort, like the PRINCE Consort's. But, allowing for
all the improvement that the last twenty years have brought about,
there is still suffering, ignorance, neglect, and degradation enough in
this Black Country to justify the writing of far harder things than the
hardest Mr. Punch could write, even at the whitest heat of his indigna-
tion, in the deepest blush of his shame, in the bitterest scalding of his
sorrow, in the warmest glow of his pity.
SOCIETY FOR RELIEF OF THE WILFULLY BLIND.
ERE, in the Quarterly Report
just issued, we observe seve-
ral very obstimate cases of
this prevalent malady. Some
are strongly calculated to

below drawn a few notes at

public acceptance, hoping
they will be found of value
to those who suffer under a
singular affliction.

ECONOMY AT ATHERTON.
EconoMY is the soul of Local Government. This maxim is illus-
trated by the Local Government Board of Atherton in the following
advertisement, which has appeared in the Manchester Guardian :—
LERK WANTED.—The Local Government Board for the district of
Atherton, in the county of Lancaster, require the services of a Gentleman compe
tent to fulfil the duties of CLERK to the Board. He will require to reside within the
district. His duties will be to keep the books and accounts of the Board, according
to a system similar to that adopted by the Poor-law unions and approved by the
district auditor; to examine and check the weekly accounts of the surveyor and
collector; attend personally at every meeting of the Board and Committees, take
the minutes of every such meeting ; write out the rate-books of the Board, there
being at present two general district rates made per annum; prepare all demand
notes, receipts, &c., for the collector, and all contracts, agreements, notices, forms,
&c., required by the Board; conduct all correspondence, and otherwise perform all
the duties of the said office, carrying out the spirit of the “standing orders" of the
Board, the Local Government Acts, and the other incorporated Acts relating to the
powers and business of the Board. The salary to be allowed has been fixed after
the rate of £40 per annum; no additional remuneration whatever will be paid for
extra services of any description rendered to the Board. The person appointed will
be required to enter upon his duties immediately ; the appointment to be held
during the pleasure of the Board.—Applications, in the hand-writing of the candi-
dates, stating age, &c., and enclosing testimonials as to fitness for the office, must
be addressed to “The Clerk to the Local Government Board, Atherton, near
Manchester,” not later than Wednesday the 5th day of December next.
By Order of the Board.
Boardroom, Public Hall, Atherton, 22nd November, 1866.
Another maxim, however, equally true, is “Parsimony begets Em-
bezzlement.” The great amount of labour for which forty pounds
a-year are offered in the foregoing announcement as a remuneration, is
worth a great deal more than that comparatively small sum. Yet the
offer will no doubt he accepted, for forty pounds are forty pounds, and
the duties to be performed in return for that salary may afford oppor-
tunities of eking it out, whilst the ºrgº of those duties may
admit of being considerably neglected. So that the Local Administra.
tion of Atherton ought not, to be surprised if one fine morning they
find, should any º fellow accept their laborious and underpaid
clerkship, that he has bolted with a portion of their funds, and left
their accounts in confusion. |

Conductor. “FARE, Miss DoN'T MENTION It ”
MEMENTO TO MISLEADERS.
INSINUATE that mine's a drunken lot,
I’ll soberly disprove the imputation.
But talk to me as though I were a sot ..

Who calls me fool offends me not so much
As he who shows me that he thinks me such.
Say we’re impulsive, and I little care.
hat charge my smiling calmness shall refute.
But much you will insult me if you dare
Attempt to play on me as on a flute,
To agitate me with false eloquence,
Meant to create sensation, not strike sense.
Don't go to work me up with gross appeals
To purblind passion and stupidity,
Which declamation, void of truth, reveals
That you attribute in your heart, to me,
Whilst with your tongue, that much your mind belies,
You tell me I am all that’s good and wise.
Don't extol me, don't butter me, don't soap.
Don't flatter me... I’m neither king nor fool.
Don't think to wield me at your will; don't hope
Me with the vapour of your mouth to rule.
A working man a thinking man may be.
Sway, Demagogue, the mob—but I’ll be free.
Ritualists.
THE Ritualists now lay great stress upon the point of their close
resemblance to the Early Church. The Roman Catholic Oratorians at
Brompton are, after all, nearer than these mock turtles, as they have
their first service at 5:30 or 6 A.M., which is Early Church enough in
all conscience.
THE CULTIVATION OF ANAKIM.
The language which has been employed by MR. BRIGHT in his
speeches on Reform may be strong, but is not nearly so revolutionary
as that employed by SIR DAVID BREwsTER in delivering a lecture to
the Edinburgh Royal .# “On Light as a Sanitary Agent.” The
learned Professor is reported to have expressed himself as follows:–
“If, then, the light of day contributed to the development of the human form
and lent its aid to art and nature in the cure of disease, it became a personal and
national duty to construct our dwelling-houses, our schools, workshops, factories,
churches, villages, towns, and cities, upon such principles and in such styles of
architecture as would allow the life-giving element to have its fullest and freest
entrance, and to chase from every crypt, and cell, and corner, the elements of
uncleanness and corruption which had a vested interest in darkness.”
Who can doubt the soundness of scientific reasoning advanced on
such authority as that of SIR DAVID BREwsTER P If accepted and
acted on it will, however, effect a complete revolution in our domestic
architecture. Our houses will be as conservatories and greenhouses,
our cottages as melon-beds, and cucumber-frames. Who can fix any
limit to the dimensions which the human form may attain to if
Posterity is grown under glass f. The British people, may wax great
indeed when it comes to be raised in this way. England's Royal
Palaces will be all Crystal Palaces; and then what great Kings
and Queens and Princes will spring up ! Morality will rise to a high
degree when the actions of all the inmates of every abode become
visible to their neighbours. There will be no more any street Arabs,
or any other mischievous boys to break windows; because there will,
on the one hand be no windows to break, and, on the other, of course
those who live in glass houses will not throw stones.
Explanatory.
THE Compositors, it appears, declined to join the Trades' Reform
Procession. Probably they thought that if there was any crowding or
crushing in their division, people would say it was the letter-press.
But printers can hardly be classed with working-men, they more
resemble the Bourgeois type.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE UNITED CABINET.
A COUNCIL IN DOWNING STREET.
Lord Derby (in continuation). Yes, all very fine to call it a canard, but
the wild duck flies with the wind. It is a bore that such a thing should
appear in the Scotsman.
Mr. Disraeli. So unfounded a statement, too. . At least, I suppose
that it is unfounded. Our organs have declared it to be so, and they
ought to know best.
}.} Cranborne. I am sure that nothing that has occurred here could
justify the assertion that we are not unanimous—painfully unanimous-
monotonously unanimous. To say that I am not upon the best of
terms with the right honourable gentleman, the CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExchEQUER!
Mr. Disraeli. Or that he entertains feelings less exalted than reverence
and admiration for the noble Lord who presides over India!
Lord Cranborne. If there is anything which I honour, it is frankness,
consistency, and large statesmanship. - - -
Mr. Disraeli. A.; if there is anything which I adore, it is good-
nature, modesty, and self-abnegation.
General Peel (aside to Mr. Walpole). What are those chaps humbug-
ging about P
Mr. Walpole. I never understood a second meaning, but I hope that
they are only poking some kind of fun—not that such a thing is appro-
priate in a serious discussion.
General Peel. O, I like fun as well as anybody, and the more we
have of it the better in this bothering old world, but look at their
my. Those ain’t strictly funny, as at present made up, eh?
d Derby. Well, gentlemen, we’ll take mutual regard for granted,
and go to business. §. DUX BUCKS.
The President of the Council. Order, my Lords and my Gentlemen.
Lord Stanley. Here is December. e have eight weeks, and then
the Speech must be written. What is to be said about Reform * ..
Lord Cranborne. Without wishing to be in the slightest degree disa-
able, might one, ask why the initiative in reference to domestic
egislation is taken by the Secretary for the Colonies? -
General Peel. Bother! Hang it ! What the deuce does it matter
who takes it? I move that we say nothing about Reform. There !
Lord Cranborne. I beg to second the motion of the gallant General.
Lord Derby. Come, that’s like business. The Anti-reform Cock’s in
the pit. Who puts down a cock to fight him?
r. Disraeli. I compliment your Lordship
traditions of Lancashire. And I accept the invitation. I move as an
amendment that HER MAJESTY's Speech should contain, as its first
paragraph, an announcement, that, in a week, a Bill for the improve-
ment ºthe representation will be laid before the Legislature:
Mr. Walpole. I don't move anything. I beg pardon for interrupt-
ing. But should not the Speech begin with thankfulness about the
Cattle Plague, you know?
Mr. Disraeli. Let the cows alone, and take the bull by the horns.
Lord Stanley. Certainly. I second the proposal of the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER. And we ought not to separate to-day without
settling the question.
The President. Has anybody got anything more to say?
Lord Malmesbury. Why, really, nothing has been said at all. Surely,
surely, we are not going to rush at a decision without hearing the
arguments.
Lord Derby. Argue away, my dear fellow. -
Lord Malmesbury. O, I haven't got anything to say, at least anything
particular.
Lord Derby. Then say something general. Anyhow, let’s get on.
Lord Malmesbury. I would really rather listen to others than speak.
Mr. Disraeli. It is an odd taste, but eccentricity is the flavour of
society. I, as mover of the amendment, had better give you my reasons
for supporting a Bill. It is that I do not wish-I mean that I do not
think it will be for the good of the country—that we should go out in
March.
General Peel. Iºdon’t know about that. We could be turned out
comfortably, and go off, jolly, for the Easter holidays. Let's see, when
do they fall? I must look at Punch's Almanack, which I always carry
about me. (Takes out THE Almanack.)
Lord Derby. After you, PEEL.
Lord Chelmsford. And after you, LoRD DERRY.
General Peel. I just shan’t. Buy your own copies." How mean you
are :
Mr. Disraeli. The Tories were always mean to the press, not that they
are niggardly, but that they have no true appreciation of its power.
General Peel. I bought a hundred copies—went to Punch's office
myself for them—and I’ve been giving them * to everybody. Here
you are, “Easter Sunday, the 21st April.” say—that’s awfully
convenient. Let’s go out the second week in April.
Sir John Pakington. My dear General, this is positively outrageous.
Why do you talk about going out, as if it were part of a programme *
I am not prepared to say that it is not unconstitutional.

General Peel. My honourable and bumptious friend, don't be a
hº;
The President. Order 1 order - º
Mr. Disraeli. Permit me, though *: on this topic to the gallant
General, to say that I am convinced that when he termed the FIRST
LQRD OF THE ADMIRALTY a humbug, he only meant to express his
belief that to affect to anticipate the retention of office, while aban-
doning the only means of securing it, is a course savouring less of
intelligence than of insincerity.
General Peel. Precisely. Put that in your pipe, PACKY.
Sir John Pakington. The good humour of the gallant General dis-
arms hostility, and I will now address myself to the main question.
am free to confess that I share the opinion of those who do not dis-
believe that it would be possible for HER MAJESTY's present adminis-
tration to frame a Reform measure which might not be unsatisfactory
to the country.
General Peel (to Mr. Walpole). Is he for or against? Blest if I can
disentangle his blessed negatives.
Mr. Walpole. For.
General Peel. Pump :
Lord John Manners. It would be very distressin
just when one had got the flower-gardens into suc
spring. CowPER knows nothing about flowers, an
most piteous work with my nice arrangements.
| Lord Derby. You shall come and look over my gardeners at Knowsley
JoHN. I am sure that we shall be enchanted to see you, and you sha
read poetry to the ladies in the evening.
- John Manners. That would be a great consolation, my dear
friend, and I am very much obliged to you. But I have taken no end
of }} with the Parks—the word makes me ready to weep.
r. Walpole. Don't! Always command your emotions.
Lord Chelmsford. We are as slow as Chancery. , Let us come to the
point. Do we care enough for a chance of our places to sacrifice our
principles—our recorded principles?
Mr. Disraeli (slowly). Yes—recorded principles, LoRD CRANBORNE.
Lord Cranborne. Other records might be as inconvenient as the
speeches of last session, MR. DISRAELI.
Lord Derby. Pardon me—noblesse oblige—and so on, I cannot hear
the matter discussed in that manner. I do not care one farthing about
office, and, but that I serve my party, I would sooner be out than in.
| Don’t let us talk vulgarly.
Lord Chelmsford. I am not vulgar. I used to be called the elegant
THESIGER. I never did or said a vulgar thing in my life.
| Lord Derby. Never. I know it., I retract vulgarly, and substitute
without due regard to conventional decorum.
Mr. Disraeli. I do not affect to despise office. But you may buy gold
too dear. However, it may facilitate our settlement if I say that I
decline becoming the advocate of any Bill which shall not be apparently
large enough to afford me some chances in the combat. If I throw a
tub to the whale, it shall be a big tub.
General Peel (aside to MR. WALPole). If he was thrown to the
whale, like JEHoshAPHAT—or somebody—we should get on better.
Mr. Walpole. Hush | Pray do not be irreligious.

We have promised a Reform Bill when it was not asked for. Now
that it is very much asked for I can't see that we can omit such
romise. My view is, therefore, that we bring in a decent kind of

(Erterior of the Feudal Castle. Interior.)
WHAT inconvenient P. these old castles are! This Bovor Castle

othing.
Happy Thought.--Tell the flyman to shout.
He says if he shouts, it will frighten the horse. I must shout, and
he must run back and tie his horse up: then return and shout. In his
absence I walk along the side of the moat, to see if there’s any way of
crossing without the bridge. None.
It’s very solemn and . rºy in the moonlight, and mysterious and
dark out of it."f feel as if I’d come to release \ Y, Queen of Scots.
I see a punt moored to the opposite bank: MARY, Queen of Scots, again.
I see the places where they used to pour hot lead out on to the
people below. --- - - - -
ope CHILDERs isn't hiding, and going to have any practical jokes.
Flyman returns. I tell him to shout.
Happy Thought.—A man can’t shout with any energy in cold blood.
The shouting of a hireling cannot be so hearty as that of the person
interested.
I tell him to shout louder.
He asks “what name he shall shout?”
I tell him “CHILDERs.”
He begins, “Hi, CHILDERs' CHIL-DERs!”
I don’t like hearing him behave so familiarly, but won't stop him, in
order to insert the “Mister,” or perhaps he won’t shout any more. I
fancy he takes a secret pleasure in calling the present owner of the
castle “CHILDERs.”
i. Hays he can’t do it any louder. Absurd ' A flyman, and can’t
Sllout, .
I begin, “CHILDERs 1” I take a turn of two minutes. There’s no
echo; no effect of any sort, except a growing sense of hopeless desola-
tion. The flyman is sitting on a portmanteau, and beginning to dose.
“Chil-DERs' ChIL-DeRs 7 Childkrs!”
I can't believe they’re all asleep. They hear me, and won’t get up.
It’s cruel. “CHIL-DERs, hi!! !!!” He may not be at home.
Somebody must hear.
Happy Thought.—Make the fl shout with me...
Duet—“CHILDERs' Hi! Hi! CHILDERs! Hi!” I don't like
leaving off for a minute, but we are obliged to do so for want of breath,
the hireling giving in first. -
Happy Thought–Throw a stone at a window. Glazier less expensive
than driving to a hotel. -
We look for a stone. Flyman says he should like to break a window
or two. I tell him there’s no necessity for that. Can’t find a stone.
Can't throw grass.
Shout once more, Wish we'd not left, off shouting, to look for
stones; as, if we had roused them, they’ll all have gone to sleep again.
Wish I was in London—in bed. Wish I’d asked for an answer to
my telegram. Wish all this while I shout.
Alight behind a red curtain at a window. A voice, which comes in
as a pleasant relief to ours, says, “Hallo!” A stupid thing to say, by

It is down: he works, it with one hand. He says, “..Qh yes, it was
no good calling the maid to do it. They're all in bed.” Flyman crosses
with the luggage. I pay him, standing under the portcullis: he
grumbles, and I pay him again. I stop to admire the romantic scene.
CHILDERs says “Yes, deuced cold though, See it better to-morrow
morning.” He closes the gate, and leaves the drawbridge down. He
tells me he was asleep when I arrived.

Happy Thought—Praise the place as much as possible to put him in
a good humour. Wish I could recollect, if he's got a family or not,
I’d ask after them. Qught to recollect all these sort, of things before
calling on anybody... Safe question to ask him, “All well aſ hºme!”
only it sounds as if he had just arrived, not I. His reply is, “All Tº:
well,” and I wonder to myself whether there is a MRs. CHILDERS. I've
only known CHILDERs as a bachelor in town. I don't recollect his
mentioning MRs. CHILDERs then. -
We cross a court-yard, which reminds me of being in a small
college, and coming home late. In fact I can't help expecting to see
plenty of lights, and hear jovial voices. Neither.
He asks me, doubtfully, if I won'titake any supper. I say, “No,
no, my dear fºllow don’t let me F. you to any trouble.” By which
iſ want him to understand that I’m § hungry, and had expected
to find chickens, champagne, and salad awaiting, my arrival. He
replies, “Oh no trouble in the least. As you don't want any, you’d
like to go"to bed at once.”
I say “Yes, at once!”
Happy Thought.—Never travel without biscuits. Makes you inde-
pendent. So do matches and soap. -
A noise in the passage. Two men, come in loudly. One, who I
should say sleeps in his spectacles, has evidently had his trousers,
slippers, and shooting-coat close by his bedside. The Qther has only
been able to lay hold of the two first articles. º rush in, shake me
by the hand heartily, and say “How d'ye do, old fe
as energetically, “How d'y do?. How are you?”
Happy Thought-ºf have certainly never seen either of them before.
They are asleep Ithink. -
ey insist on shaking hands again. They then look at one another
and laugh. I laugh. CHILDERs laughs. We all laugh. We then sit
down, and there is a pause.
Happy Thought.—I say, cheerfully, “Well, I’ve kept my promise.
Here I am.”
The short man in spectacles laughs as if he were going to make an
observation, but doesn’t. The taller man smiles thoughtfully at the
candle. I am almost positive they are asleep. ...CHILDERs observes
“That he didn’t expect me solate,” but adds, that “he’s deuced pleased

up to do it, and then resumes his dosing.
I suppose they don't introduce people at Bovor. Wonder if they’re
brothers or cousins, or only friends. ust take care what I say.
Short man in spectacles inquires for something to drink. CHILDERs,
addressing him as “BoBBY,” tells nim he can't want º at that
hour. It appears, however, that he can, and does. The er man.
also wakes up at the mention of something to drink; and the bar-
barian, who has now lighted a pipe at the solitary candle, is struck
with the idea, as a good one.
They, all know where everything is, to be found. BoBBY says he
wouldn't mind somet to eat. Tall man, becoming more wakeful
§ minute, suggests “cheese,” and, as an after-thought, “bread.”
The barbarian, taking a kindly view of my case, asks me to join him in
a pipe, and wait till CHILDERs brings in some cold pie. This (with the
exception of the pipe) is thoughtful. I take to the barbarian.

Everyone's gone to get something. There is an air of hospitali

CHILDERs returns alone, with a cold pie and a plate.

are. He is surprised., “What, don’t I know them?” No. Oh, then
he'll tell me. The short one, in spectacles, is Bob ENGLEFIELD, the
dramatist, Don't I know him?
Happy Thought.-Say (in order not to offend him), “I’ve heard the
name somewhere.”
“The tall one,” he continues, “is a very rising fellow—JACK STEN-
TON.” I ask, “Rising? in what way?”. CHILDERs replies, “Oh, in
every way: philosophy, and that sort of thing.” Then adds, as if this
wasn't enough to determine his character, “Writes for several reviews.”

“Why Poss?” Nobody knows: they’ve always called him so.

THE NEW RUNNING DRILL.
(A RESPECTFUL APPEAL TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE commander-IN-CHIEF.)
CAPTAIN BLUARD, As HE APPEARED IN CoMMAND of His Company.
SYMPATHY SUPERSEDED.
It is with heartfelt pain that, compelled by a sense of duty, we give
the advantage of universal publicity to the paragraph subjoined:—
“Floggings For Highway Robbenirs.-At the Stafford Winter Assizes yester-
day, Thomas HARRIson, CHEAvenil, WELCH, and JAMEs ARMSTRoNG were convicted
of assaulting and robbing Thomas BRoadBENT on the 2nd of September at Wolver-
hampton. MR. Justice BYLEs said that people must walk the streets in safety, and
he should pass a most severe sentence on the prisoners. HARRIson, who had been
previously convicted, was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, and to receive
25 lashes with the cat-o'-nine tails. The other prisoners were sentenced to 12 months'
imprisonment and to receive 20 lashes each.”
Poor Thomas HARRIson' Poor CHEAVERIL WELCH ! Poor JAMEs
ARMSTRONG ! No wonder at the sequel of the foregoing extract:—
“The sentences were received with evident dismay by the prisoners.”
* The feeling mind must sympathise with the mental pain with which
the poor footpads above named anticipated the physical pangs which
they were doomed to experience. It would be well if garotters and
other thieves accustomed to combine robbery with violence were aware
that, when a criminal is flogged, the executioner who administers the
lash waits about half a minute between each application of it. This
gives the convict under its infliction full time to realise to the utmost
the sensation which it excites, and to reflect on the inexpediency of
committing the crime which earns such a recompense: , Poor HARRI-
son, poor WELCH, and poor ARMSTRONG probably didn’t know this
when #. assaulted and robbed THoMAs. BROADBENT. But they were
most likely informed of it by some kind fellow-prisoner in gaol. Some
companion in confinement, who had himself been *: also perhaps
explained to them thoroughly the physical effects and, the impression
on the sentient nerves produced by the cat-o'-nine-tails. , Well, then,
may the poor fellows have regarded its prospective endurance with
may.
But pity for the destined sufferers of the scourge, however distressing,
ceases to grieve us when we consider the likelihood that their sufferin
will prevent some cruel outrage which, but for it, would be perpetra
on somebody or other. This consideration would make us contemplate
the punishment they are to undergo as we should regard a surgical
operation, only we should not smile upon the latter as we should upon
the former, because pain is not the essential of the surgeon's handi-
work, whereas it is that of the executioner's. Therefore, we cannot
recommend that the patients whom JUSTICE BYLEs has most judiciously
sentenced to flagellation, should be subjected to that process under the
influence of chloroform. *-

IDREAD a rebellion. I dread it, Sir, on account of the fearful
destruction of property which must ensue. Directly I heard that there

with a certain proportion of rum; add a little sugar, and

THE MANHOOD OF LAMBETH.
..I.AMPETH, famous for Short Weights and Bad Measures, had to
vindicate its character. When MR. Thomas Hughes reminded his
constituents of the little distinction above indicated, he was met by
hisses, Lambeth then considered the situation, and on the whole
arrived at the just conclusion that something ought to be done, England
clearly looked scornfully at Lambeth, and regarded it as a fosterer of
rascality. So it was thought that when an º arrived for
another meeting, it would be well for the masses of Lambeth to show
that they could extend patient and respectful attention to their repre-
sentatives, and even, should either of the latter entertain views which
were not those of the majority, he should be judged fairly, and, if
necessary, censured calmly, and as became men who held themselves
entitled to pronounce political verdicts. The opportunity was last
week afforded. MR, Doulton, M.P., invited an audience, and it
came. The Morning Star shall continue the story:—
“The Chair was taken by MR. ALDER, Carriage-Builder, of Newington, who tried
in vain to obtain a hearing. After having essayed to do so for some time, he gave
up the attempts in despair, and MR. Doulton then came forward The scene at
this moment was of the most exciting and extraordinary character. For several
minutes the honourable Member stood facing the assembly, his friends cheering
vociferously, whilst from the body of the meeting came counter demonstrations of
the most tumultuous description. Several gentlemen with excellent intentions
advanced to the front of the platform, and gesticulated wildly in the vain hope of
quelling the uproar. These attempts, however, ouly provoked a fresh storm of
shouts and jeers, whilst above the noise some electors gifted with more stentorian
lungs than others could be heard uttering expressions of indignant disapproval of
their Member's Parliamentary conduct.”
This statesmanlike proceeding lasted for a long time, and at length
MR. Doulton thought that it might be more practical to address the
reporters only. Those gentlemen, whom nothing ever deters from
their duty, took such notes as the impassioned utterances of the
assembly would permit, but occasionally the howling was too frantic
to jº. the speaker's sentences to reach the stenographers. But they
took down enough to show that MR. Doulton endeavoured to º
fairly, and to offer his antagonists his reasons for the votes he had
given in Parliament. But even this modified arrangement did not
please the friends of Manhood Suffrage, and the Star proceeds:–
“At this juncture the people occupying the body of the hall became intensely
excited—the pottery boys lost all self-control, if they ever had any—and the ‘ticket-
holders' of the platform sent defiant cheers in the teeth of the loud and unmis-
takeable disapprobation manifested by those who formed three-fourths of the main
body of the meeting. A rush was made for the platform across the tables occupied
by the reporters, who, effecting a precipitate “skedadle,' notes in hand, took the
platform by storm.”
Nevertheless the gallant reporters, driven off for a time, returned to
the charge, and managed to hear MR. Dou LTON say,
“If anything were wanting to show the tyranny of those who, up to the present
time, have been leading the people, and to show how they would exercise, their
influence over them, I think we could find it in the infuriated language used in the
last few weeks to render this meeting of mine impossible.”
The discussion continued, but MR. Doulton pluckily stood, his
ground, completed his address, and retired amid a storm of yelling
and hooting. Then some folks of another sort mounted the platform,
and were heard with applause. They carried resolutions in favour of
giving every man a vote. MR. PUNCH heartily congratulates Lambeth,
the meeting, and the promoters of the good cause upon their amicable
and patriotic tolerance, and the decided, advance which such demon-
strations cause to the fortune of Manhood Suffrage.
Might makes Right.

Who plucks both marks and lands from friends;
And, in her grasp their wealth possessing,

a falling off in our mural literature. , Time was when

renown by some popular legend inscribed upon it, an
though dead men tell no tales, dead walls produced some
charming fictions, and Town boys who delight to run and
read, could boast of their familiarity with the choicest
gems of mercantile romance. Some eccentric traders had
their advertisements literally lithographed, and when
walking we have been startled by a flagstone at our feet
solemnly charging us to tolerate no more #" hair, but
boldly stand the hazard of the dye, and old ladies were
startled at every turning by horned monsters advertising
the Smithfield Cattle Show. -
Omnibuses now carry on a brisk trade in the diffusion
of commercial knowledge, and our Merchant Tailors pay

JUDGES ALWAYS AT FAULT.
THE report of an assault case which occurred in the Court of Common
Pleas, before LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE Bovill and a special jury, the
other day, contains the subjoined passage, commencing with a state-
ment given in evidence:—
“The defendant would not let the cabman into the house, saying, “Don’t put
your foot inside my door, or you will have to pay fifty bob." (Laughter.)
“The Lord Chief Justice. Fifty what?
“MR. STRATToN (Examining Counsel). It means shillings, my Lord.”
There is one particular wherein the learning of learned Judges appears
to be commonly at fault. Their Lordships in general evince a remark-
able unacquaintance with those synonyms which, amongst the masses,
are usually substituted for words º, have a place in Johnson's Dic-
tionary. In short, no Judge ever seems to unders and slang. As, for
instance, when a witness is undergoing an examination, and there
ensues a colloquy of this sort:-
Counsel. And then you said, what?
Witness. And then I said, “Here’s me and BILL agin you two and
that other bloke.”
Judge. What does he say, Brother GABBLEs?
Counsel. Bloke, my Lud; a word in use among the humbler classes.
It means man.
Judge. Homo or rir 2
Counsel (grinning). Wir, my Lud.
Judge. Very well; go on.
Counsel (to witness). And then you said, “Here’s me and Bill agin
you two and that other bloke.” Well, and what did the prisoner say ?
Witness. He said I’m good for two-and-a-kick.
Judge. Two-and-a-kick?
Counsel. Half a crown, my Lud; two-and-sixpence. A kick, in the
language of persons of the witness's station in life, means sixpence.
Judge. Sixpence. Oh! Sixpence. A kick—sixpence.
Counsel. It also signifies, your L’idship, that part of a glass bottle
which a French Minister described by saying that the bottom entered
the interior. But sixpence is the witness's meaning.
Judge. I uniº.
Counsel (to Witness). When the prisoner said he was good for two-
and-a-kick, did he do anything?.
Witness. He put down the money.
Counsel. He put down the money. Was any observation made in,
the prisoner's hearing f
Witness. BILL said, “Who stole the moke P”
Judge. Stole the what? Stole the bloke—the man? How could he
steal the bloke *
Counsel. Moke, my Lud, not bloke. A moke is what costermongers
call a donkey.
{. Really the language of that class of persons is very extra-
ordinary.
When the case has been completed, and the Judge sums up, he is
F.'. sure to make some remark on the strange expressions which he
las heard, speaking of them as though they had then occurred to his
ear for the first time. As thus:– “And then, Gentlemen, the witness,
as you heard, used certain words, which perhaps may be new to you.
He spoke of a bloke, and he mentioned a moke. Now, Gentlemen,
bloke and moke are words that sound very much alike, but you must
know they are not convertible terms; that is to say, they don't mean
the same thing : for bloke, as we are informed by the learned counsel,
whose explanation of these terms is, I have no doubt, as correct as it
is clear, signifies man, and moke donkey. Not but that some men
may be termed donkeys in a certain sense; but that is not the sense in
which the witness used the word moke. Well; and then, the phrase
two-and-a-kick, Gentlemen, means, as you heard, not anything involving
a peculiar assault, but a sum of money—the sum of—ell, brother
GABBLEs –two shillings and sixpence.”
Whether the learned Judges whom such words and phrases as those
above instanced apparently puzzle, never possessed any knowledge of
them at all, or have simply unlearned them, is a question that may be
asked. There is º: pleasing in the thought that the purity of
the ermine exerts on its wearer a mysterious impulse that expels from
the memory every word of a grotesque and undignified character which
it may have been charged with during its experience at the bar. A
.." propriety, too, appears in a Judge's innocence of thieves'
atin.
Hard but Natural.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SUICIDE BY CRINoLINE.
Hose ladies who are fond of
reading by the fire-light are
requested to |. and pon-
der on the following:—
“The coroner remarked that
this cuse, and that of the poor
girl whose death in Sloane Street
was last week recorded in The
Times were instances of the ex-
treme liability of women being
injured or killed by fire. In the
one case the distended dress was
the cause of the calamity, and
this oue showed that the material
of women's dress added to their
risks. There were 3000 women
burnt to death annually in Eng-
land and Wales, and for every
death by fire there were twenty
persons injured who recovered,
and this being the case, it might
\ well be said that there was room
*W) for a reform in women's dress.”
Reſorm * Yes, we should
think so: , but how, are we
- -- to get it? To reform, the
House of Commons is difficult enough, but it is, merely child's play
to the labour of reforming the follies of the fashion. Here we see
that crinoline and muslin kill women at the rate of three thousand a
year; but the risk of being burnt to death is nothing in the eyes of
fools whose aim is to be fashionable. Better die a fiery death than live
out of the fashion.
So the Suttee system spreads, and women commit suicide without
thinking of the sin of it. Perhaps were this view of their wickedness
plainly put before them, it might serve as a deterrent. Deaths which
are occasioned by wearing dresses specially constructed to catch fire,
can hardly be regarded as being accidental. . One might as well expect
to smoke a pipe in safety in a powder magazine, as sit in safety near a
fire-place in a protruded petticoat. When the dress catches fire, it
cannot be extinguished, because of the air under it. Yet women,
knowing this, still wilfully persistin wearing suicidal clothing. Perhaps
they might be somewhat frightened towards, reform, if, instead of
giving verdicts of “accidental death,” our juries returned verdicts of
“Suicide by Crinoline.” -
PUNCH*S MIDNIGHT REVIEW.
Relly's Post-Office Directory, for 1867. pp. 2904.
“A GREAT book is a great evil,” said the eminent Grecian, but he
might have reconsidered his famous dictum if he had had the advantage
of beholding and studying this colossal work, which is not less remark-
able for its vastness than for its accuracy, and convenience. The
industry which could collect, and the skill which could condense and
distribute into accessible departments so enormous a mass of informa-
tion, are worthy of an age of engineering triumph, and we unhesi-
tatingly declare KELLY's Post-Office Directory to be one of the most
signal memorials of British energy and talent.
Our young man had written thus far, when his wife looked over his
shoulder. -
“My goodness, ALPHONso,” she said, “are you out of your senses?
Are you writing for Punch & What are you composing all those
absurd sentences for P They are just nothing but a stupid common-
place review, such as any one of Punch's office boys would write.”
“I don't care,” said Alphonso, recklessly. “It’s twelve o'clock,
and I am too tired to write wit.” -
º, leave it alone, then. I’m sure I wouldn’t send in such stuff
as that.
“What do you mean by stuff?. It’s very elegant—you women are
no judge of composition. I shall do nothing else,” said this dogged
and venturesome young man.
“Yes, dear, do,” said the affectionate counsellor. “At least add
that it is the most wonderful book in the world, and how they find out
the addresses you can't think. Why, we have only been in this house
three weeks, but here we are–
“Alphonso SMITH, 16, Lucretia Villas, Alabaster Road, West Camberwell, S., and
Arts Club, W.” -
“Wonderful book, beautiful print, capital map, strong, binding,
indispensable to everybody,” said Alphonso. “Blessed if I don’t
send in what you’ve been saying–teach you to interfere with a great
writer.”
“Oh ALPHONSO !”.
“I shall, though.”
And he did.
[And for his flippancy received a wigging which will remain on his
mind until he is ordered to notice the Directory for 1808–Ed. P.]
A BEAST SHOW IN THE HAYMARKET.
| THE Cattle Show, as usual, has been held this year in Islington, and
some remarkably fine beasts were as usual exhibited. But we see
there is announced to take place in the Haymarket another public
exhibition of-not to put too fine a point upon it—beasts. ing
borrowed from the French, the show is called by a French name, it
being difficult to find a fitting English title for it. In the advertise-
ment of this “Bal d'Opéra,” as the show, is called, considerable
emphasis is laid upon the statement, that visitors may “with perfect
º, take tickets for the purpose of seeing what goes on,
which of course provokes the inference that they cannot with the like
propriety take part in it.
Moreover, it is said that “the arrangements are acknowledged to be
most effective : ” but as it is not said by whom this acknowledgment
is given, there may be a reasonable doubt about its worth. What sort
of enjoyment may be looked for at this bal may be a little gathered
from the fact that a quadrille has been expressly composed for it,
entitled, “ Therese, founded on airs sung by the celebrated Parisian
| chanteuse, MADAME THEREsA.”

to this bal the title of a Beast Show,

it never doth run smooth. , Witness, for example, the following an-
nouncement in the Globe, which is a sort of one as familiar to every
reader of newspapers as the paragraph about the great gooseberry:-
“BERNEY v. Bishop of Norwich,-This case, which was argued before the
Judicial Committee of Privy Council for two whole days last week, is to be re-
argued, it having been ascertained by their Lordships that the hearing was invalid,
as no Prelate was rummoned as a Member of the Court, in accordance with the
provisions of the Church Discipline Act. Their Lordships will appoint an early day
|ior the rehealing of the cause."
How is it that the lawyers who are charged with the conduct of
ecclesiastical causes always, omit to observe som º pre-
scribed by the Church Discipline Act, or by some other? The .
of every such cause, is sure to be impeded by some such blunder,
tending to frustrate the ends of ecclesiastical justice. Hence protracted
litigation, which would be ruinous both to the Bishop and the party on
the other side, if they were not both well backed by their respective
supporters. Perhaps the lawyers know that the expenses on either
side will be defrayed by subscription, out of which they think they may
as well get as much for themselves as they can by contriving to make
mistakes that will necessitate proceeding de noco, Are ecclesiastical
attorneys particularly stupid, or are they too clever by half?

NOBLE CONDUCT OF SIR. THOMAS WILSON.
THE Times publishes a copy of a very brief but very gratifying letter
addressed by SiR Thomas M. Wilson to a resident at Hampstead, who
had written to SIR. Thomas in reference to the Heath. We also subjoin
it, from the Times, but we have the additional pleasure of stating that
the letter to which it is a rº ly pointed out to SIR Thom As Wilson
that it would be very º: to the inhabitants of London, it they
were permitted to mark out a Race-Ground, and erect a stand, with a
view to holding races on the Heath. This explains the answer, which,
as given by our contemporary is,
- Charlton House, Dec. 7, 1866.
Sir, Take your own course.
I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
Thomas MARYon Wilson.
Arrangements will at once be made for carrying out the plan so
generously assented to by SIR. T. M. WILson.
The Sister's Penance.

BRITANNIA having to put the strait-waistcoat on Hibernia; though
to judge, by the arrests, the part of Mys-tery is not quite so well kept
up in Dublin as that of Miss Terry in London.
A DISAPPOINTMENT.
GREAT surprise was expressed by many country visitors when they
found that the Pope had not sent any of his Bulls to the Cattle Show.

a good supper as his area pensée.

“Of course I don’t mind a haunted room P” Of course not.
I announce, as a curious fact, that I never was in one. Somebody
says, “No P really l’’ as if I was quite an exception to the general
rule.

They admit they’ve not; “but, perhaps,” CHILDERs says, “he’ll
be more polite to visitors.” . Have I had all I want? CHILDERs wants
to know. Yes. We retire from the dining-room in procession, BoBBY
first, CHILDERs last, myself just before CHILDERs.
It is a very old house. Tiles on the floor in some parts. Can't see
the advantage of tiles: perhaps they thought they were going to build
roofs, and ãº their minds. . -
We pass through a large hall with a splendid old fireplace. Enor-
mous chimney. [Note for Typical Developments. Look up authorities
about the Mediaeval Sweep.] There is an oak screen at one end.
My candle (they know their way about without any), though not
particularly brilliant, puts everything else in the shade. -
I can’t help exclaiming, having an eye for the picturesque, “Charming,
delightful j place l’” -
ChILDERs replies, “Yes. Wants doing up.”
“Doing up !” I exclaim... “Oh, no.”
'º' says he, “you don't know it. Rats and damp. Come along
to bed.”
Somebody says “Hallo!” from above. ... It startles me. Whether it
is the shadows or the candle, or the family boots all in a row, I don’t
know, but I am nervous. CHILDERs points BoBBY’s face out to me,
high up, looking out of a little window in the screen. I daresay an
ancestor put it down as a “Happy Thought” to have a window in the
screen. 1diot! - -
I stumble up the glorious old oak stairs... My candle only shows me
the next step each time. The shadows which I make...by moving the
light about, look exactly like rats. These stairs twist so. Ancestors
could never have walked straight.
Happy Thought.—To ask if there are any black beetles.
No. None. Except in the hall through which we’ve just passed.
I stumble up three more stairs and some loose tiles. Did ancestors
have carpets?
Happy Thought.—Look out in some Useful Knowledge Dictionary,
“Carpets. When introduced into England. . By whom F},
We are on an old landing. I ask, jocularly, whose ghost it’s sup-
posed to be that haunts my room?
CHILDERs doesn’t know. JACK STENTON (the rising philosopher)
does. He informs us, “Old woman burnt.”
I say, “Oh P' inquiringly. “Old woman burnt, eh?” and medi-
tate on it. I don’t know what I think about it. But I do think. We
all stop to think.
“Let’s get in,” I suggest. They say, “Let’s do so.”
CHILDERs stops on a stair to say, he hopes I’m prepared to rough
it a little, as he didn't expect me.
I tell him I like roughing it. Wonder (to myself) what his idea of
roughing it is. I knew a man whose idea of roughing it in the country
was to have a villa in a park, a French cook and a valet. He used to
tell me he would be perfectly content with homely fare: his idea of
homely fare was potage à la reine, mullet and woodcocks. Ho
CHILDERs calls this roughing it. CHILDERs stops suddenly, and looks
at Bob ENGLEFIELD, the dramatist in spectacles. A notion has struck
him: . He says, “I don't know how we’ll make you a bed, though.”
This promises to result in roughing it.
I am ready with a manly reply, “Oh, I can sleep anywhere.” I
qualify this by adding, “for the night.”
Bob ENGLEFIELD, who has a ready invention, says, “Oh, I’ve got a

Śrºstos the reviewer, who appears more thoughtful perhaps
because he's sleepier than the others, says, in a deep voice, “Sheets.”
With a view to lesson the roughing it process as much as possible,
I say decidedly, “Yes, sheets.”
CHILDERs * know where the sheets are.

Poss FELMYR asks, “how about a pillow P”
With the same view as before, I second this inquiry.
Bob ENGLEFIELD has it. “The sofa cushion.’
Carried nem. con, and I brighten up.
Bob ENGLEFIELD has it again. “There are two sheets in his room
for him to-morrow.” - -
I say, “don’t bother on my account” politely. CHILDERs replies
cheerily, “Oh, we’ll dodge it somehow,” and I look forward to
roughing it. We are obliged to bring all my luggage up, as I can't
recollect in which thing my sponge is.

Some one (the novelist, I think) says he’ll lend me a towel. Each
one will give something like the three Witches in Macbeth. They all
say, “Here’s a lark!” and run off to collect the materials. Childers
gets the sofa cushion, and we make for my room. Luggage on a landing.
In my Room.—This is, I am informed, the Haunted Chamber, where
the old woman was burnt. Odd; as I remark there is no fire-place.
Bob ENGLEFIELD, JACK STENToN, and OLD Poss are making my bed.
It is one of those iron unfolding things which is intended for a chair
and a bed.
Childers apologises for its being a little cranky, and OLD Poss
tells me I must take care when I am lying down to lean more on the
left than the right side, or it will give way.
... They enjoy making the bed. I fancy they laugh because they think
it’ll be uncomfortable. It appears none of them have ever done such
a thing before. Poss Fei MYR says he recollects making apple-pie beds
at school. I’ll examine mine when they’re gone.
Happy Thought.—Every man ought to be able to sew his own buttons
on, and make beds if necessary. If I ever have a family they shall
learn all these things.
The bed is made, and, as they are all immensely pleased, I thank
them, and they retire, hoping I'll find it all right, and adding that “If
the Ghost comes, I’d better throw the sofa cushion at her.”
I do hope that there are not going to be any practical jokes. Irecollect
hearing of a man becoming an idiot when a practical joke about a
ghost was played on him.
Happy Thought—To wind up my watch while I think of it.
Childers walks to the window.
“I’m afraid.”. he says, apologetically, “that the window doesn't
fasten very well.”
I say, “Oh, never mind,” implying that there's no necessity to send
for a plumber and glazier at this time of night on my account.
... But,” he explains, “it’s a tumble-down old place.” -
I,tell him I like this sort of thing amazingly. He expresses himself
glad to hear it.
Am I quite comfortable?” is his last inquiry.
I look round at the truckle bed, at my bag, at the towels, and reply,
that I am, cheerily. I have a misgiving that I shall want some.

Won't hear you.”. It is an oddly built place; everyone appears to be
sleeping in “another passage,” with a staircase all to himself.
I make the best.of it, and say cheerfully, “Oh, I shan’t want any-
thing till morning.”
“Then, that's all right,” returns Childers. He comes back to tell
me that if I want a bath in the morning, Engierieli's got it.
I thank him. When he's gone I remember that I don't know where
ENGLEfielp's room is. He comes back once more to tell me that the
door doesn't fasten very well. He wishes he could give me a better
rººm. "My dear, fºllow,” I say, “Capital—excellent—the verything
I like. So quaint,” I add.
"Well,”, he says, “it is a quaint little place: better than a great
uncomfortable modern room.”
I don't answer this... Somehow. I don't like his praising the room.
He º to have left that to the visitor. Childers wants tact. He

ghosts.
I reply, I'll tell him all about the ghost in the morning. I re-
member (as he says good night) a story of this sort in Washington
IRWING, I think, where a man jested about telling them in the morning
about a ghost and was haunted. I think his hair turned white, and he
saw a picture roll its eyes, and the top of the bed came down. i
fº rget exactly; but it's not the sort of thing to remember just as
you're going to bed in a strange place. He is gone, and I quite
forgot to ask him about ENGLEFIELD's bath. How my presence of
mind deserts me !
Happy Thought.—Brush my hair.
Very dull and lonely here. My face in the glass looks spectral; not
like it does in other glasses. I feel as if some one was going to look
over my shoulder. Shake this off. Make notes. Analyse my nervous-
ness for a chapter in Typical Developments. \
Oak panels. No fire-place. Wind is getting up.
Happy Thought.—Early wind getting up as I’m going to bed.
Joke this. Laugh to myself. Look in the glass. In the glass I
appear like a dull photograph. Window blown open. No blind. As
ChILDERs says, it does not fasten well: as a matter of fact.
Wind getting up more than ever. Rain, too. Casement windows
begin to rattle.
Happy Thought.—Fasten the window-latch with my rug-strap. Done.
Rats in the wall, I think. Can't come out. Manage to latch my
door. Very cold and damp feeling. Think of FRID9LINE SYMPERson.
Fancy some one’s coming in. A sense of desertion and loneliness
comes over me. Note it down, and, having done so, feel it less. Horrid
candle, and no snuffers.
Happy Thought.—Put my note-book and candle by bedside on my
portmanteau, and jump into bed quickly. Do it.
Truckle-bed gives. They’ve managed to make the bed so that I get
more blanket than, sheet. The sheet seems to be chiefly round the
pillow. Try to pull it down. Worse. Leave bad alone. Will read
in bed. Remember some one saying it’s dangerous. Suddenly think
of the old woman burnt. Casement rattles. Rug-strap won't hold.
m * Window blown open. Shall I get out, and shut it. Think over
this.
No: more healthy to let the air in, as there’s no fireplace.

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
Hunted Down at the St. James's, I only arrived after the Second
Act had commenced, and derived additional gratification from the
accident, as the mystery of the plot was rendered doubly mysterious.
It was admirably . all good. An elderly gentleman in the next
stall to me allowed the curtain to descend without making any obser-
vation, and it was not until we were well into the afterpiece that he
suddenly exclaimed to a young lady at his side, “Oh, then she was his
wife.”—which I take it meant that he had suddenly discovered the
whole point of the plot. -
Miss OLIVER & Company have made a great success with the
burlesque version of Black-eyed Susan. Union is strength, and the
actors at the New Royalty play well, together. It is not like many
burlesques, made a mere piece of patchwork by the vanity of ignorant
professionals. There is not a song for, Miss So-and-So here, and a
dance for Mr. Whatshisname there, and twenty lines for somebody
(who ought not to be allowed to say twenty words) somewhere else.
No, at this theatre individuals work for the general effect, and both in
Meg's Diversions and Black-eyed Susan the result is a genuine success;
in fact so strongly has “the business” of one of the songs taken hold
of the public that the management of another theatre has copied it as
nearly as possible. A graceful compliment, undoubtedly, as imitation
is the sincerest flattery.
THE GAIN OF GERMANY.
THE dull and stolid English middle classes, who do not see that
Germany has got much good by the late conquests of Prussia, will not
perhaps have their vision greatly improved for that matter by the
subjoined telegram from Dresden relative to the Saxon Chambers:–
“To-day the Upper House unanimously adopted the new Army Bill, which
proposes the introduction of general liability to military service, and adopts the
other essential points of the Prussian system."
To be sure our Philistines know pretty well that German unity is
rather a good thing for themselves. They are not unaware that an
united Germany constitutes an equipoise to France, and that the pos-
sible inconvenience for England of a German fleet is at any rate remote.
But they are far too dense to envy the states annexed to Prussia, or
constrained to acknowledge Prussian supremacy. Seeing that the
Saxon Parliament has voted the introduction of general liability to

A PLEA FOR PANTALOONs.
It would be incorrect to call DR. MARY WALKER a physician in
petticoats. She is a physician, indeed, and a duly qualified one ; a
physician, moreover, of experience not only in actual practice, but also
in actual service. Still she is not a physician in petticoats: for DR.
MARY WALKER wears mether garments of a description similar to
those which are worn by the majority of doctors. Only they are
named “pantalettes.”
Now, why pantalettes ?, Call a spade a spade. Miss WALKER is
not styled “Doctress.” What is the good of mincing phrases? Let
pantaloons be named pantaloons. When physicians go to Court they
are attired, as to the lower limbs, in the fashion which gentlemen were
wont to use before pantaloons were invented. Suppose a female phy-
sician took to wearing the like, as she probably would if she married,
there would be no refinement in modifying their simple name. They
would not be rendered at all the more becoming by being called
“breechesettes.” -
Some people laugh, at the idea of ladies' pantaloons. Certainly,
crinoline is a more serious matter. We must perhaps take with some
grains of salt the statement that three thousand women annually fall
martyrs to hooped pettieoats. Still, no doubt, a very large number of
cooks, and housemaids, and small shopkeepers' wives, who continue to
wear them, do get roasted to death in their own cages during the year.
Ladies who laugh at DR. MARY WALKER's pantaloons, are earnestly
lººd to take care lest one day they laugh on the wrong side of the
mouth.
At this season of the year, when the public mind is intently occupied
with the anticipation of Boxing Night, no apology can be necessary for
the discussion of pantaloons.

and to do it far better than any existing company could play it as a
whole. For not only does Miss GLYN set before us the realisation of
a fine conception of a great part, which she gives with marvellous
power, but her reading elevates the minor parts to the intellectual level
designed for them by the poet, and thus we have a noble picture,
instead of a single prominent figure surrounded by puppets. The
admiration which Mr. Punch feels for Miss GLYN's personation of

SEASONABLE INGREDIENTS FOR A CHRISTMAS PUDDInG.
AN HONOURABLE PROFESSION IN FRANCE.
.THE following announcement in the Post suggests a high idea of the
dignity of the French Bar:-
“The BAR and the Turf in France.—The French Council of Advocates has
decided that to be a Member of the Jockey Club is incompatible with the profession
of a barrister.”
The Jockey Club is an institution which has for one of its objects
that of keeping the Turf as clear as possible of rascals. This, of course,
cannot be the reason why the French advocates consider membership
of that body incompatible with the forensic profession. Their objection
to the Jockey Club must be supposed to rest on the belief that it does
not succeed sufficiently well in its endeavours to keep the Turf
honourable. Hence follows the inference that the Bar of France has
fixed for itself a very high standard, of honour. Accordingly we sup:
pose that no French barrister would ever condescend to accept a brie
on behalf of a notorious quack, for example, bringing his action for
libel against a critic who had called him a scoundrel. So, neither, we
presume, would an honourable member of the French bar, deign to
undertake the cause of the plaintiff in an obviously speculative action
for breach of promise of marriage; for what black-leg can be farther
below the dignity of a true gentleman than a “gentleman of the long
rebe” who suffers his tongue to be hired as an instrument of extortion?

BEGGING THE QUESTION.
. . DEAR MR. PUNCH,
PAPA is so hasty and speaks so loud that, I always tremble
when I ask him for an explanation of any little simple thing. Were it
otherwise, I am sure I would not trouble you, dear Mr. Punch, know-
ing how much of your valuable time is taken up by young ladies
desiring information on various matters of importance, but whose
perplexities cannot be greater than mine are at the present moment.
I am very anxious to know what is meant by a phrase I have often
heard Papa use in argument—“Begging the Question,” and I'll just
mention how my, anxiety arises. At a thé dansante very recently,
CHARLEs proposed and I accepted, on the understanding, of course,
that he obtained Papa's consent. Well, last evening an opportunity
offered; Papa was alone in his study, CHARLEs knocked and walked
in. I listened at the door with a faint feeling, and distinctly heard
Papa say sternly, “Sir, you are begging the question,” so I concluded
#. º the question of Papa was the same as popping the ques-
lon to me.
Now, dear Mr. Punch, don't you thinkita sad thing that high-minded
young men like CHARLEs should be obliged to begin this way? In
distant countries where pastoral manners prevail, a lover is not
required to humble himself to obtain his dear one's hand. No, he
comes with his flocks and herds to the rustic dwelling of his intended
and if her parents are pleased with his offer they take his lambs an
fº him their Liza. What a pity it is we can’t do so in Belgravia,
this custom could be introduced there, how nice it would be, and
what a sweet pretty picture it would make. Oh, fancy a very fair-
y calculates the value of his *: ift. º ily, in our
case, CHARLEs has no flocks and herds. If he had, Ithi #, would
give him a kind answer, and not revile him, poor fellow, because cir-
cumstances over which (during his uncle's lifetime) he has no control,
compel him to do what I know his º revolts at, though I suppose
many do it every day, without blushing, but then, as you are aware,
º differ, and some poor young, barristers would, Idare say,
rather die single than expose their briefless condition by beg ing the
question. Pray pardon, dear Mr. Punch, this intrusion, and #. me,
The Olives. AMELLA SwansDown.
Yours very very sincerely,
P.S.. I have solved the prize enigma in my—that is, dear Punch, in
our Pocket-Book: it is “Two-lips.” Papa says no, but I point out to
imit must be that or º similar, and then he becomes warm
and vehement, and concludes by reproaching me for begging the
question. Whether I am innocent or guilty Idare not, in my present
ignorance, venture to say.
[You are wrong, dearest AMELLA.—Ed. ºf P. B.]
A CRUSHING REFORM.
- THE Vestrymen of London and its neighbourhood are respectfully
advised to repair, as soon as they conveniently can, to Hyde Park, so
as to see in operation there the machine mentioned in the subjoined
newspaper paragraph:-
“Steam-Rollen in the Panks.-Atlast a Steam-roller has been set to work in
the Parks. It is a cumbrous looking machine, and is worked at night. One result
of its working may be seen on the Kensington side of Hyde Park, where some newly
laid granite was transformed into a smooth and compact mass on Friday night.”
The brutality which mends the roads with fragments of granite,
leaving them to be ground down by carriage-wheels and the feet of
horses, has long been a disgrace to British local self-government, and
afforded a spectacle to foreigners' derision. There is something ex-
tremely ludicrous in the excess of dogged barbarism. This eminently
arochial quality is frequently displayed in the expedient of laying
own logs of wood on either side of the sharp stones which a tract of
road has been newly mended with, in order to prevent drivers and
riders from shirking them. The brutes accustomed to resort to this
contrivance may now go and learn how stones may be crushed by an
engine which the stones cannot hurt in return, as they do a horse or a
carriage. If steam-rollers are not put immediately in use on our
highways, the savages whose duty it is to mend the roads ought to be
compelled to walk, barefooted, over a good mile of their own macadam.

If the Pillory were still an institution, the occasional exposure in it of one of the too
numerous Bears that provi amongst those gentlemen, would probably have the effect of
rendering their body avery much more respectable one than it is at present. -
The lying Bear who set about the report that the Chairman of the South-Eastern Railway
had failed, would, with his face and fore-paws fixed in a Pillory, erected in the place, where
Stock-jobbers most do congregate, present them with a most edifying spectacle. In default,

THE BLACK COUNTRY, NOT ALL BLACK.
...LET our friends and correspondents of the Black Country-good or
ill-natured, regretful or angry, reasonable or unreasonable—be assured
that in anything Punch has written of their district, in connection with
the inauguration of PRINCE ALBERT's statue, at Wolverhampton, he
has neither meant to malign the country nor to ignore or undervalue
the efforts of those—and they are many, as he is thankful to acknow-
ledge—who are doing their best to educate and improve the habits of
its working population. The very purpose of his lines was to point
out how much needed such efforts were, and how appropriately PRINCE
ALBERT, as the advocate, aider, and abettor of popular education, the
#. promoter of social improvement, the foremost asserter of the
uties of capital and culture to labour and ignorance, took his place in
the centre of a region where education, improvement, and culture have
been so terribly neglected heretofore, and are so sorely needed now.
Surely, there was nothing in this that could justly offend those who
are helping in the good work to which the PRINCE Consort owes his
hest honours.
the bitter waters of truth have caused wry faces to any such, Mr.
Punch, is sorry; the tonic was not meant for them. It was adminis-

acknowledge, on cool reflection, that the medicine was not superfluous.
