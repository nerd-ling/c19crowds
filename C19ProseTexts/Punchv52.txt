BRITANNIA'S BABY-HOUSE.
AIR-“ There was an Old Woman."
THERE was an old woman who lived in a stew,
She had so many Members she didn't know what to do:
So her House she pulled down, built a new one instead,
At a cost that made Bull's hair rise up on his head.
'Twas the floridest, flashiest plan she could get,
All gurgoyle and crocket, and finial and fret :
With stone Kings and Queens stuck about it in swarms,
Stone angels, stone dragons, and stone coats-of-arms :
Stone lions in crowns, sitting up on one end;
Stone unicorns rampant, in stone panels penn'd:
And windows, for fear too much light should get through,
Dark with monsters heraldic, in green red and blue.
In short, decoration was piled to a pitch,
That, like Melton pork-píes, many tastes found too rich.
But lest its profusion should turn JOHN BULL's brain,
'Twas the same thing repeated again and again.
There were forests of pinnacles, piercing the air ;
And mazes of lobbies, to goodness knows where :
And by way of direction to wand'rers at need,
Labels writ in black-letter that no one could read.
And a house for the SPEAKER, where room there was not
For swinging his cat, if a cat he had got:
And a tea-room and dining-room gorgeous to see,
But most inconvenient for dinner or tea.
Committee-rooms, stifling when windows were shut,
And by Father Thames poisoned, when wide they were put :
And a new ventilation for bringing in pure
The air that had travelled for miles through a sewer.
With pride DAME BRITANNIA her new House surveyed
(Though she raised some ado ere the bills were all paid);
But she found, when her Members she came to instal,
That their new Gothic quarters would not hold them all.
Their tale was six hundred and fifty and eight,
And four hundred at most could find șitting-room strait :
And when the four hundred were packed, 'twas averred
That the louder the speeches, the less they were heard.
She did all that she could in her Members' behoof,
She coved in the cornice and lowered the roof,
But acoustic improvement no change would afford :
Sounding bores there were plenty, but no sounding-board !

THE SWEATING OF SOVEREIGNS.
O FREEDOM from tormenting cares !
It would be such a blessed thing,
That, safe to make my own affairs,
Almost I fain would be a king:
But what a life must sovereigns lead !
Of income though they rest secure,
Perhaps the lifelong fear of need
Not equals all that they endure.
They're sure of their three meals a-day,
Of house-room and apparel-true.
But, well indeed, they earn their pay,
If any slaving mortals do.
From early morn till late at night,
Hard fagging monarchs cannot cease.
In quiet thought denied delight,
They never know a moment's peace.
'Tis not the dull routine of State,
The documents to sign and seal,
That I should so intensely bate,
If I reigned o'er the commonweal.
Nor is it any mental task,
That active kingship might demand,
Or Government's direction ask-
Such simple labour I could stand.
'Tis all that pomp, parade, and show,
Day after day, for evermore ;
Which weary sovereigns undergo,
That I should vote so great a bore.
Those levees, drawing-rooms, and balls,
Which oft, in guise grotesque arrayed,
They needs must hold in gilded halls,
(Or ought to) for the good of trade.
'Tis laying those foundation stones,
* Inaugurating," as they say,
Those statues, that would make a throne's
Work, to my mind, beyond all pay.
'Tis that kings ever must allow
Addresses to fatigue their ears ;
Where'er they go, compelled to bow
Acknowledgment of idle cheers.
'Twould irk me being, any night,
Required to dance just when one feels
Disposed a bland cigar to light,
Or smoke a pipe, and rest one's heels.
Engaged in a perpetual round
Of solemn, tedious, trifling things,
I hardly think I would be crowned
To lead the life that's led by kings.
No, scarce to gain a mind at ease,
Nor live in dread of fall delayed,
Beneath the sword of DAMOCLES,
With "workhouse" written on the blade.
But if I did accept the part
Of Royal pageantry and show;
I'd act it out with all mine art,
And pay the debt which sovereigns owe.
For the Use of the Belgians.
The Camp at Wimbledon will this year offer a fresh attraction in the

PASHA AND PADISHAH;

OR, PUTTING A FACE ON IT.
East and West a hob-a-nobbing,
Giaour and Moslem hand-in-hand,
Fez and Chimney-pot a-bobbing,
Side by side, along the Strand !
Who says 'tis an age prosaic,
Common-place, in dulness drowned,
When, dovetailed in strange mosaic,
Contrasts such as these are found?
In the days of great AL-RASCHID,
Whatwould Moslem Sheiks have thought,
Had the CALIPH thus his rash head
To the British Lions brought !
Think of crews of red-cross Galleys,
Rhodian warriors, or Maltese,
Changing their crusading sallies
For civilities like these !
Lo, the stagnant East upheaving,
Stirs with feverish unrest,
Impulse 'gainst its will receiving
From the forces of the West.
Pasha, Padishah, saluting,
Through the Railway's rush and scream,
See Kent's pleasant fields go shooting
Past them, like a hachich-dream:
See a country all of gardens,
See a realm of steam and spade;
Labour, Law, and Peace its wardens,
None to make its sons afraid :
See its fair face at the fairest,
Not the nakedness below:
Who art thou thy sores that barest ?
Pauper ?-Hence, nor spoil the show!
We've a Padishah!to dazzle,
We've a Pasha to amaze ;
We've to teach them England has all
That makes prosper, all that pays.
Keep the paupers in the Union,
Lock the vagrants in the ward;
From such frowsy, foul, communion
Needs our Eastern Guests we guard.
Show our millions of toilers,
Mete their work and count their pay:
How the engines burst their boilers,
Here and there, no need to say.
If Trades-Unions threaten, picket,
Ratten, murder, now and then
On such dark facts close the wicket-
Blue Beard's closet o'er again. .
Don't present our guests to Bumble ;)
Keep him from our village schools :
There are things at which we fumble,
Or come down between two stools.
Union sick-wards smell unpleasant;
Workhouse nurs'ries breed foul air :
Don't show how we house the peasant,
Or the Padishah might stare.
If your House he deigns to visit,
M.P.'s, let your hands be clean :
Though that's scarce the feature (is it ?),
By observers soonest seen.
Would he learn how you can cobble ?
The Reform Bill let him see :
Would be watch a party-hobble ?
Of the Carlton make him free.
Generally, keep the platter
On the outside very clean ....
Let sensation-writers chatter-
Things are judged by what is seen.

SIX MONTHS OF LIFE-SAVING.
A REPORT just issued by the National Lifeboat Institution affirms that in the first half of
this present year of grace no fewer than four hundred and forty-three lives have been saved
by the lifeboats on our coasts. A society which saves nearly a thousand lives a-year (in 1866 it
saved nine hundred and twenty-one) is certainly deserving of liberal support. Conservative
support should also be extended to it, and Radicals and Tories ought to vie with one another
in trying who can help it by the biggest cheque. The office is at 14, John Street, Adelphi,
where the Secretary is ready to respond to all inquiries as to the great service yearly rendered
by the lifeboats, and where the largest contributions are most thankfully received.

Nor reply to my tenderest talk “She had heard

She'd the brooch I had bought,
And the necklace and sash on;
And her heart, as I thought,
Was alive to my passion;
And she'd done up her hair in the style that
the EMPRESS had brought into fashion.
I had been to the play
With my beautiful Peri,
But for all I could say,
She declared she was weary,
That the place was so crowded and hot, and she couldn't
abide that Dundreary."
Then I thought, “ 'Tis for me
That she whines and she whimpers;"
And it thrilled me to see
Those sensational simpers ;
And I said, “This is scrumptious!” a phrase I had
learned from the Devonshire shrimpers.
And I vowed, “ 'Twill be said
I'm a fortunate fellow,
When the breakfast is spread –
When the topers are mellow-
When the foam of the bride-cake is white, and the fierce
orange-blossoms are mellow."
Oh, that languishing yawn!
Those emotional eyes !
I was drunk with the dawn
Of a splendid surmise-
I was stung by a serpentine smile, and tossed
on a tempest of sighs.
And I murmured," I guess
The sweet secret thou keepest,
And the dainty distress
That thou wistfully weepest;
And the question is Licence or Banns a' though
undoubtedly Banns are the cheapest."
Then her white hand I clasped,
And with kisses I crowned it;
But she glared and she gasped,
And she muttered “Confound it !”

more than doubted; it is denied. The statement that they succeed in
gaining the masses can only be made true by taking the letter m away
from the word masses. They ape the Mass, but do not gain the masses,
and those whom they do gain are stupid asses.

ANOTHER REMARKABLE STUDY FROM NATURE.
A LEAP IN THE DARK.
A FINE horse, a fine rider,-and first of the steed-
Caucasian Arab, they say, by his breed-
Limbs lithe, light, and lissome; with sinew to spare,
And though past mark of mouth, not a single white hair :
Yet his coat seems to change, as 'tis viewed in the light,
Now, a dull Oxford mixture, now dark, and now bright.
Till what its true colour, 'twas puzzle to say,
Till they found a new name for it-Vivian Grey-
His temper, you 'd say, that a quieter horse
Never played in a paddock, or walked o'er a course,
But for all he's so quiet, a look in his eye,
Warns 'gainst trusting one's ribs his fine fetlocks too nigh.
And if ever a horse had a will of his own,
One is fixed in that flesh, and was bred in that bone :
Ere you cross this dark horse, let him look ne'er so nice,
See you've muscles like whip-cord, a band like a vice,
Or the horse you'll soon find with the bit in his teeth,
And the rider, where riders should not be, beneath.
And he who backs this horse, for field, course, or park,
Ten to one, finds he's taken-a LEAP IN THE DARK.
And what of his rider, the lady in blue P
There are fears and forebodings, BRITANNIA, for you!
Though in front of the field 'twas your glory to show,
Time was when your steed by your will had to go :
When though riding your fastest, you still, as you led,
Kept a hand on your horse, and a watch well ahead ;
Never rushed at your fences, your mark overshot,
Nor galloped o'er ground where 'twas wiser to trot:
When, if strange to a country, you stuck to a guide
Who knew it, -nor scorned by direction to ride :
When if a big jump, or a blind, crossed your course,
You noted the ground ere you lifted your horse;
If the lie of the land binted danger beyond-
Old quarry, or chalk-pit, sunk road-way, or pond-
When your horse would have taken the fence in his stride,
You pulled him together, and turned him aside,
And the chance of a fall and a fracture to baulk,
To the terra incognita went at a walk-
Too brave to heed sneerers' or scoffers' remark,
And too wise to hazard a LEAP IN THE DARK.
Those fashions you've changed, and those rules you ’ve thrown by;
With no hand on your reins, across country you fly,
Curb and snafile hang loose, and your horse has his head,
And as once you steered him, now he steers you, instead ;
Takes a line of his own, you reck nought where or how;
Let him trot over pasture, and gallop o'er plough?
Let him shy the old ways, well-known gaps, ancient rides,
Leave your skirt on the thorns, smash your knees, bruise your sides,
In his rush betwixt gateposts too straight to pass through,
At stone walls he can't leap, gates you cannot undo;
Till at last, when your head you have lost in the run,
When your eyesight is failing, your strength fairly done,
When your line shaped at random, the guide-posts upread,
You know not an inch of the country ahead.
He goes by BRIGHT and GLADSTONE, HUGHES, FAWCETT, and
MILL,
At a thundering gallop, tearing with you down-hill,
In his stride takes the fence that, big, bushy, and black,
Throws up its thick sprays, and sharp thorns in your track,
And over it skims, like a lad in a lark,
And—who knows what will come of this LEAP IN THE DARK ?
THE CARCASE AND THE VULTURES.
The Tichborne Baronetcy and Estates are in Chancery. The Post
announces that “ bills have been now filed in the causes of TICHBORNE
0. TICHBORNE and TICHBORNE 0. Mostyn,” remarks that " in this

"A formidable array of Counsel are engaged on both sides. The ATTORNEY and
SOLICITOR-GENERAL are retained by the plaintiff's solicitor, MR. HOLMES ; and in all

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SONG OF A TAILOR-NOT ON STRIKE.
My life is dull, my lot is low,
Sleep brings me dreams of cannon balls.
A page ascends the death-heaped stair,-
A tailor-sitting on a board-
And hostile garments rolled in blood :
Ho! Doth thy Mistress tidings send ?
I urge a hot goose to and fro
With morn I wake to troops of smalls What! Tokens from my lady-fair ?
O'er seams of fustian, seams of cord. Stained by a peaceful country's mud. “No! MR. THOMPSON's coat to mend."
I had a dream in early days,
Sometimes a thought across me comes,
“Oh! heedless, heedless 'prentice boy,
Ere cramped about the heart and knees, - In busy labours of the night,-
The errand you too-quickly ran.
The youthful longing for the bays
That I do hear the roll of drums-
One hour-I feel the warrior's joy,
That heroes bring across the seas.
Loud clarions clam'rous for the fight. The next-a fraction of a man!
But poverty-in scornful mood
Then my swift lance despises rest,
Yet, wherefore should I thus regret
Upraised a haggard face and said,
Fierce through the ragged breach I whirl, A blood-stained wreath-a shroudless grave;
“Go! Take this needle, work for food, This hand hath made a crimson vest, Men's hearts are not so narrow yet,
Thy fate is spun of wincey thread.”
And pinked the doublet of an Earl.
But they may think a tailor brave.
When now I wish for great renown,
O'er lifeless limbs I hotly press,
I have a friend who loves me well,
A "ragged regiment me assails;
O'er soulless bodies---cut and torn, There is a maiden holds me dear;
The ghosts of future jackets frown
I see the ranked battalion's "dress," Away regret! Renown farewell !
From out paternal swallow-tails.
Gods! It will an awful morn.
I have a worthier consort here.

The dews begin to linger,
Cease to drain the frequent pewter,
Once again, amid the revel
On the Christ Church meadows laid.
Cease to make the flagon ripple.
Of the theatre above,
Every spire's a ghostly finger,
My binocular I level
Every wall a fringe of shade.

At the face of her I love.
But the night is nearly gone,
Cooks their fellow'rs are regaling :
It is hard that my awaking
Once again, through Memory's vista,
I seem myself to see,
By the window flits the bat:

And where she I love kiss'd me.

Its walk is still and bare,
And because his flagon deep-
And the Chris-I beg their pardons-
Where I and LAURA flirted.

What silly things we were !
That my mind should be disgusted

Through my LAURA's very tones,
Her turrets and her stones.
And because his systems porous.

Hark! a fall the ceiling shaking!

Whether it be wine of Xerez,
The usual percursor
At the tankard or the cup;
Or the subtler juice of Port.

O SYMPATHY with others' joys !
That's what we ought to feel, my boys.
He who has that can want no more ;
He's happy howsoever poor.
Entranced in the mesmeric state,
"Tis said that some participate,
In taste, of what another eats ;
And share his drinks as well as meats.
If you could sympathise like that,
An Alderman might gorge green fat,
Yet not enjoy it all alone;
For you might make his gust your own.
You could rejoice when gourmands dine,
And quaff the best of every wine,
For so they'd be obliged to do
Not only for themselves but you.
Beyond the pleasures of a meal,
All others' gladness could you feel,
Envy would in your bosom end;
Your rival's self would be your friend.
What if, preferred, he gain your Miss
Imagine his domestic bliss.
Be conscious of it if you can;
Then will you be a happy man.
But sympathy should never go
So far as sharing others' woe;
For wbilst that hurts you, it doth not
At all alleviate their lot.
Let me not taste the sable draught
Which by mine ailing friend is quaffed,
Nor of bis leathery chop or steak,
With sympathetic sense, partake;
Nor share my blessed rival's ire
When Madam's bills bis patience tire,
Or when she, with her whims and pets,

The weather is warm as I walk in the square,
And observe her barouche standing tranquilly there,
It is under the trees, it is out of the sun,
In the corner where GUNTER retails a plum bun.

Plumes a sky-blue, and her pet a sky-terrier-
The scene is majestic, and peaceful, and shady,
Miss HUMBLE sits facing : I pity that lady.
Her footman goes once, and her footman goes twice,
Ay, and each time returning he brings her an ice :
The patient Miss HUMBLE receives, when he comes,
A diminutive bun: let us hope it has plums !

A HINT FROM THE WHITEBAIT.
Dizzy, whose Caucasian glory
Doth all Eastern lore enfold,
Well thou know'st th' Arabian story
By SCHEHEREZADÈ told,
How the enchanted fish, defying
Breadcrumbs brown and yellow yoke,
From the pan, where they lay frying,
Words of truth and warning spoke.
Gammon deem it not and spinach,
Nor proclaim it " like a wbale,
If from white bait's moath at Greenwich
Mr. Punch unfold a tale.
At the Ship the Official Party
Gaily round the table drew;
In vacation prospects hearty,
Red-tape fetters broken through.
Blood of innocents and martyrs,
Life-blood of birth-strangled bills,
Left these Ministerial Tartars
Free to eat and drink their fills.
Not a face you there might question
Told how as a burden
sate
On the Cabinet's digestion
Humble pies that it had ate.
On no conscience of the bevy,
In so far as looks betray,
All too hot or all too heavy,
Weight of broken pledges lay.
None had guessed those diners hearty
Late had gone volte-face about,
Coolly turned their coats and party
With “hey-presto!” inside-out.
But the gods above they knew it,
And the little fish below:
To the waiters the winds blew it,
E'en the mud-larks seemed to know.
Blushed, while on the watch for coppers
On the hard they held their stands,
Felt the mud where they took croppers
Clean to Ministerial hands.
Souchés had their watery zest bad;
Fishes boiled, and stewed, and fried,
Fishes plain and fishes drest had,
In their weary round, been tried.
And the appetites were waning,
Seeking whets à l'Indienne :
Of monotony complaining,
Ministers grew moody men.
When to still official pishes,
Charm official taste and smell,
In were borne those loaves and fishes
Folks in office love so well.
Crisp and hot as they had fried them,
Lay the whitebait, sauté quick,
With the brown-loaf squares beside them,
Thinly sliced and buttered thick!
Eyes official gleamed and glistened,
As the pleasant piles they view;
Ears official longed and listened
For the President's “Fall-to."
Sudden, as with hand officious
QUARTERMAINE the covers stirred,
Came a whiff of scent delicious,
And a silv'ry voice was heard.
'Twas the White bait's chosen squeaker-
Mute as fish are known to be,
Every tribe has still a speaker
For its sessions under sea-
“Call not, pray, the query fishing,
If, my swells, I ask you why,

TURNED AWAY FROM THE TOWER.
MR.'PUNCH,
TAERE was a time when you could walk into the open space
about the Tower of London, and wander around that historical edifice at
your own sweet will. Now, for some years, at the entrance thereof,
has been posted the odious notification—"No Thoroughfare," and you
cannot enter to inspect the outside without paying to be shown over
the in. You yourself, Sir, would actually be barred in the exercise of
your former freedom of way. But this exclusion is not all. The other
day, having, with some children, gone the round of the Tower show,
conducted by a beefeater, I, as soon as that bore had relieved us of his
presence, took them to see the specimens and relics of old artillery
arranged at an outer corner of the building. Presently a soldier came
up, and told your correspondent, very civilly, to be sure, that we were
doing what we could not be allowed to do unless accompanied by a
warder. On inquiry, I ascertained that this new prohibition had been
in force three months, and that it was dictated by the authorities.
Now, Sir, the Deputy-Lieutenant of the Tower is, I believe, LORD
DE Ros, or, as the schoolmaster said, LORD de Rore, to give him his
due. LORD DE Ros comes de Roribus that came in with the Con-
queror; therefore authorities subordinate to his Lordship are the
authors of the recent edict which expels the public from the precincts
of the Tower, and they decreed it without his knowledge. You, of
course, discern the logic of this argument. LORD DE Ros is noble;
the edíct is churlish. It could have been none of his; it must have
been the ordinance of niggardly, and presumptuous underlings and
Jacks-in-Office. If you will publish this letter, the knightly De Ros
will, doubtless, have the uncourteous regulation, which those fellows
probably dared to promulgate in bis name, incontinently rescinded, and
cause the knaves themselves to be soundly whipped, and imprisoned in
the most uncomfortable dungeon of the Tower Moat.
The open space surrounding the Tower may not be an eligible place
for Reform demonstrations, but if the public are to remain excluded
from it, the Government might as well close Kensington Gardens. I
note, Mr. Punch, with very great dissatisfaction and disgust, the daily
increasing curtailment of the right of way belonging to us from time
immemorial, and acquired by
USER.
Black v. White.
A WOMAN-HATER of Mr. Punch's acquaintance declares that the
substitution of brown for blonde complexions and tresses, is bringing
Black-bait into fashion instead of White bait.

“Laughter” notes the reporter. Of course. But what is the inference ?
Are we to conclude “Art=wild beasts,” in the eyes of the West, or
in the judgment of BERNAL OSBORNE ?' And if the former, again we
come back to the question, are we therefore to have no expenditure
for Science and Art? But BERNAL must have more laughs, so he goes
into particulars. “ There was an Inspector-General with a salary, and
occasional inspectors at £3000, and there was a grant for taking the
Brompton Boilers to the East End of London, in order to improve the
architectural_taste of the people of Whitechapel! (Hear!' and
Laughter.) He found £2,500 a year for Professors, and from his expe-
rience of professors in that House he had acquired a great horror of
them." Very probably. Suppose we asked the professors in that
House the effect of their experience of BERNAL OSBORNE ? He goes
on, hit or miss, “Not satisfied with £2,500 a-year for Professors,” (of
course, all professors are humbugs and rascals, who draw their salaries
without earning them,) "the department had put down an addi-
tional £100 a-year for a professor, who gave his services as Dean.
He should like to know what were the services the Dean had to per-
form ? He had only time to take a bird's-eye view of these items,
because before coming down to the House he did not know they would
be brought on." You see BERNAL is "such fun”-he can get a laugh
out of anything with so little trouble! A "bird's-eye view" is enough
for him. He requires none of the bother that people have to give them-
selves who consider reasons, and weigh public needs, and take objects
into consideration, and inquire about results.
“At all events he had no hope. That House would vote anything.

No, BERNAL, stop at your "laugh." Don't go too far. You speak to

(With KIND PERMISSION OF THE LATE WILLIAM COWPER, Esq.)
BETWEEN Ayes and Noes a strange contest arose,
The Reform Act had set them unbappily wrong,
The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,
Who carried the measure we've wanted so long.
So Chief Baron Punch sat to balance the laws,
So famed for his talent in nicely discerning,
And the Star was the lawyer, and argued the cause
With a great deal of spleen, and small classical learning.
"In behalf of the Noes it will quickly appear,
And your Lordsbip,” he said, “will undoubtedly find
"That the Liberals have always been highly sincere,
"And have talked of Reform measures time out of mind."

Your Lordship observes it applies to 'The People'
Whom Tories have always distrusted, in short,
Declared bitter foes to the sceptre and steeple.
“ Again, would your Lordship a moment suppose,

That the Tories were faced by no critical Noes,
Do you think we should hear of Reform measures then ?
“On the whole it appears, and my argument shows
With a reasoning the Court will never condemn,
That the Ayes have been forced to Reform by the Noes,
And therefore all credit is owing to them.”

DEAREST girl, for the high cultivation
Of your form, take all possible care,
But oh pray to your mind's information
Of attention do pay a small share !
In a few years, without satisfaction,
On your toilet you 'll lavish your pains :
Beauty goes, and a woman's attraction
Then entirely depends on her brains.
While you still keep the figure and features
Which men gaze on with joy and delight,
You may say what you will, pretty creatures,
'Twill be taken for clever and bright.
Such delusion is owing to Cupid,
That no word can be uttered amiss,
Though entirely unmeaning or stupid,
By the lips that appear made to kiss.
When her mouth's lines of grace have got broken,
Eyes grown dim, cheeks are faded and blurred,
By a woman if nonsense is spoken,
Man perceives that her speech is absurd.
'Tis the waist that has ceased to be slender,
'Tis the ankles that no more are slim,
When she talks any folly, that render
All that folly apparent to him.
Persevere, then, with earnest endeavour,
Still those fugitive charms to enhance,
Study dress as intently as ever,
With a view to display and to dance.
But read books, too, that make the mind stronger,
When your good looks have vanished away,

BURYING THE HATCHET.
It is pleasing to read that no time has been lost by our leading
statesmen in showing that the political Millennium has arrived,
and that those whose doctrines have hitherto been most hostile
are, now that Reform .is accomplished, prepared to fraternise with
the utmost amiability. We see by the Morning Post that on
Monday week MR. BRIGHT entertained at the Reform Club a
select party, among whom were LORD DERBY, LORD GROSVENOR,
LORD ELCHO, MR. DISRAELI, LORD CRANBORNE, MR. WARD HUNT,
MAJOR Knox, MR. ROEBUCK, and the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, and
that on Tuesday, the eve of the prorogation, MR. DISRAELI had a dinner
at Grosvenor Gate, at which were present, in addition to some leading
Conservatives, both the Members for Birmingham, MR. HADFIELD,
MR. JAMES WHITE, and MR. BERNAL OSBORNE. LORD DERBY had
intended to conclude the Session with a grand banquet in St. James's
Square, and the intention was carried out, though the noble Earl was
prevented from presiding. LORD MALMESBURY took the head of the
table, and was faced by EARL Russell; Mr. BRIGHT, SIR GEORGE
BOWIER, THE O'DONOGHUE, LORD AMBERLEY, MR. PETER TAYLOR,
and other distinguished Liberals being present, in addition to a large
party of Ministerial supporters. Toasts, of course, are exploded in
all societies superior to churchwardens and costermongers, but MR.
GLADSTONE begged for a single exception to the rule, and in a most
graceful speech proposed the health of the Cabinet, coupled with the
hope that they would never forget the principles which placed the
House of Commons at the head of the Ministry. MR. DISRAELI
neatly replied that be hoped never go far to forget himself. A Reform

THE RITUALISTIC REPORT.
YOUR Majesty's faithful Commissioners, appointed to
inquire into Ritualistic Practices, have the honour to in-
form your Majesty that they have not done so.
For reasons with which they need not trouble your
Majesty, they abstained from making any report at all until
Parliament had dispersed. They may, however, just men-
tion, that they considered it would not tend to the peace of
the Church to have disagreeable Parliamentary debates on
the subjects in question.
They now beg to state that they have asked several
persons what they thought of the new Vestments, and that
The Commissioners have arrived at the important discovery
that there are different opinions on the topic.
They are strongly of opinion that it is Expedient not to
give offence.
They therefore unhesitatingly say, that where persons
are aggrieved by the ritualistic Vestments, those persons
should be enabled to obtain Redress.
The name of MR. WALFOLE, subscribed to the report,
will be a sufficient guarantee to your Majesty that no un-
called-for joke is meant in the last word of the preceding
paragraph.
The Commissioners are quite unable to offer the slightest
hint as to the means whereby such redress should be ob-
tained, but they beg to disclaim in the strongest manner
the idea that the Bishops of the Church ought to be
troubled to inquire into the doings of clergymen. If
parishioners are aggrieved, they should take action for
themselves, if able to afford it.
The Commissioners need not add, that where a minister
can induce his flock to assent to Vestments, or any other
novelty, interference would be objectionable, inasmuch as
po principle is involved in church matters, and, as has
been said, the question is one of Expediency:
. They conclude by expressing to your Majesty their con-
viction of the great value of the Commission, and of the
satisfaction with which all good persons will hail this
conclusion of an important controversy.

Pass hence with no guerdon of thanks and farewell

For the mem'ries with which their true Art has enriched us,
The hours of delight we have owed to their spell ?
No-let mole-eyed, hen-hearted, and snow-blooded scribblers,
Who write themselves "asses” in blame as in praise,
The vipers who still at the steel must be nibblers,
Who, blind to all good, call the sense of it “craze, -"

The sneers that recoil on the pens whence they flow-
If their game please the slingers, it hurts not the slung at,
And envy and malice are wide in their blow.
Be ours the more manly and pleasanter duty
To offer our homage where homage is due,
At the fair shrine of Genius and Goodness and Beauty,
Of grace ever present, and Art ever true.
God-speed to KATE TERRY, who leaves all too early
A stage such as she are sore needed to grace ;
It taxes philosophy not to feel surly
For the loss of that innocent sensitive face-
Where the ripples of feminine thought and emotion,
Of gladness's rapture, and sadness's shade,
Like sunshine and cloud o'er the surface of ocean,
With utt'rance and action in harmony played.
For the loss of that presence, still gentle and gracious,
And womanly ever, in act or repose;
The merriment chastened when most 'twas vivacious,
The grief that was rythmic, to height though it rose.
In a time of coarse cravings and coarser purveying,
When the craft of the stage 'tis a task to sustain,
Her delicate influence seemed a gainsaying
Of those who despaired of true Art and its reigr.
She has passed from us, just as the goal she had sighted
From the top of the ladder, reached fairly at last ;,
With her laurels still springing, no leaf of them blighted,
And a future-how bright, may be gauged by her past.
From childhood through girlhood to womanhood toiling,
Un-hasting, un-resting, she went on her way;
Neglect ne'er discouraged, nor praise led to spoiling,
Right instincts, sound teaching, she felt, to obey.
Nor of bounds of good taste deem the rhymester unwitting,
If of privacy's curtain so much he withdraw,
As to peep on a life such an artist befitting,
Pure, gen'rous, unselfish-a fame without flaw.
May this rhyme, kindly meant as it is, not offend her;
And fragrant with flowers be the paths of her life;
May the joy she has given, in blessings attend her,
And her happiest part be the part of “The Wife.”
Truly Base.

CRIMINAL POPULARITY.
MR. WILLIAM BROADHEAD, ex-publican (and sinner),
appears to be a great attraction still at Sheffield. The
Magistrates most properly have closed his public-house,
but they have not annulled his liberty by refusing him his
licence. MR. BROADHEAD is at large, with other uncon-
victed criminals, and has not left his pothouse bar for the
bar of an Assize Court. As a proof of his exceeding popu.

the neighbourhood, stating that a

held, and that the famous MR. BROADHEAD was "expected
on the ground.”
We wonder how much MR. BROADHEAD was paid for his
attendance, and whether he did anything to entertain the
company, more than simply walking round to show himself
to their delighted eyes. "Perhaps he sang a comic song,
introducing the old street cry of “Flare up and join the
Union,” and told some funny stories of the way in which
poor saw-grinders who would not join the Union had been
fired at or burnt out. No longer having his own pot-house
at which he can exhibit himself, MR. BROADHEAD may
be heard of soon as starring in the provinces, and giving
public entertainments, in company perhaps with his ac-
complice, MR. CROOKES. The latter villain will exhibit
the identical air-gun” with which he shot his victims;
and, as a climax, the two worthies may parody the last
scene in The Miller and his Men, and end their entertain-
ment with a Sheffield “ blowing up:

their fathers of old crowded to see MR. THURTELL's gig.

Adieu, Sir, I go to bathe in the Consonantic Welsh River.
A SCANDAL FOR THE SULTAN.
O doubt it is well, for one
reason, that the Sultan has
gone. If he had remained
here, he might possibly have
had explained to him a cer-
tain letter addressed to the
Editor of the Times, on the
subject of “Oakum Picking."
For those who are acquainted
with the details of prison
discipline, it will suffice to
quote the bare statement sub-
joined :-
“Sir, I read, two or three days
ago, that some paupers, who had
received temporary relief, were
sent to gaol for fourteen days, with
bard labour, because they had not
picked 2 lb. of oakum in the day."
But other people may need the following information :-
“Now I am certain that those who imposed the task, and punished the wretches
for its non-performance, bave not even the smallest notion of what they were doing.
I know, from my occupation, something about oakum picking, and I venture to
assert that if a thousand persons who have never picked oakum before, nor been
taught how to do it, for it is almost an art, were given the task, it would be found
that, exert themselves as anxiously as they might, the average of them could not
properly pick more than 1 lb., unless the oakum were very soft and favourable, and
that not one in the thousand persons would be able to pick 2 lb. in a day."
Had the Sultan become cognisant of the foregoing remarks, they
would doubtless have dissipated_a belief which he has perhaps taken
away with him. What is the Turkish for "Walker !" Gammon!”
and "All my eye!". Have we not borrowed a term nearly their
equivalent from that language in the word “Bosh!” Because one or
another of those incredulous exclamations would, had the SULTAN been
acquainted with England's treatment of England's poor, as above ex-
emplified, escape instantly from his mouth if anybody were to observe
in his presence that England was a Christian nation. The SULTAN
knows enough of Christianity to enable him, had he known the case in
question, to know better than that,
There is something else that the Grand Turk would probably have
said, if his interpreter had read him the preceding extracts, with this
in addition :
“I am aware that practised bands, such as able young men with hard bands,
and who have had months of imprisonment, probably, can pick double the 2 lb.;
but these are very exceptional instances, and I know that i lb. would be found to
leave the unpractised hands very little, if any, time to spare in a day, now that
daylight has become so materially shortened."
The SULTAN's observation would naturally have been that the
Justices who doomed the paupers to imprisonment and hard labour in
their ignorance of what oakum-picking is, ought to be sent to prison,
and have a fortnight of it themselves, in order to be furnished with the
necessary enlightenment on that subject.

STATESMEN and soldiers, authors, artists, --still
The top-most leaves fall off our English oak:
Some in green summer's prime, some in the chill
Of autumn-tide, some by late winter's stroke.
Another leaf has dropped on that sere heap-
One that hung highest ; earliest to invite
The golden kiss of morn, and last to keep.
The fire of eve-but still turned to the light.
No soldier's, statesman's, poet's, painter's name
Was this, through which is drawn Death's last black line;
But one of rarer, if not loftier fame-
A Priest of Truth, who lived within her shrine.
A Priest of Truth : his office to expound
Earth's mysteries to all who willed to hear-
Who in the book of Science sought and found,
With love, that knew all reverence, but no fear.
A Priest, who prayed as well as ministered :
Who grasped the faith he preached, and held it fast :
Knowing the light he followed never stirred,
Howe'er might drive the clouds through which it past.
And if Truth's priest, servant of Science too,
Whose work was wrought for love and not for gain :
Not one of those who serve but to ensue
Their private profit: lordship to attain
Over their lord, and bind him in green withes,
For grinding at the mill 'neath rod and cord ;
Of the large grist that they may take their tithes--
So some serve Science that call Science Lord.
One rule his life was fashioned to fulfil :
That he who tends Truth's shrine, and does the hest
Of Science, with a humble, faithful will,
The God of Truth and Knowledge serveth best.
And from his humbleness what heights he won !
By slow march of induction, pace on pace,
Scaling the peaks that seem to strike the sun,
Whence few can look, unblinded, in his face.
Until he reached the stand which they that win
A bird's-eye glance o'er Nature's realm may throw:
Whence the mind's ken by larger sweeps takes in
What seems confusion, looked at from below.
Till out of seeming Chaos Order grows,
In ever-widening orbs of Law restrained,
And the Creation's mighty music flows
In perfect harmony, serene, sustained ;
And from varieties of force and power,
A larger unity and larger still,
Broadens to view, till in some breathless hour,
All force is known grasped in a central Will
,
Thunder and light revealed as one same strength-
Modes of the force that works at Nature's heart-
And through the Universe's veinèd length
Bids, wave on wave, mysterious pulses dart.
That cosmic heart-beat it was his to list,
To trace those pulses in their ebb and flow
Towards the fountain-head, where they subsist
In form as yet not given e'en him to know.
Yet, living face to face with these great laws,
Great truths, great myst’ries, all who saw him near
Knew him for child-like, simple, free from flaws
Of temper, full of love that casts out fear :
Untired in charity, of cheer serene;
Not caring world's wealth or good word to earn ;
Childhood's or manhood's ear content to win ;
And still as glad to teach as meek to learn.
Such lives are precious; not so much for all
Of wider insight won where they have striven,
As for the still small voice with which they call
Along the beamy way from earth to heaven.

But through the valet of my Lord
Revealed they have been.
For once a quarter he appears,
And for the unseen three,
Three cheques receives, their quittance leaves,
And that is all men see!

Where grow from deeds and dockets
Three sinecures, such as of old

Candle-ends and cheese-parings,
To cut down pensions, places, jobs,
And triumph in small sparings.

Nor this unique example
Of a job like our fathers' jobs,
Out of existence trample !

Then shall this Mammoth-sinecure
Unwept, unpitied, perish ?
This Mammoth, that like Mammoths found
In bergs Siberian sticking,
Still shows, complete, hair, teeth and claws,
And bones well worth the picking !
A VERY BAD JOB.
(See the "Times,” of Wednesday, September 4.)
OH, cruel Times, to go and grope
In a Blue Book as cruel,
For your hard-up dead-season fire
By way of finding fuel !
To drag thereout a cosy nest
Of harmless sinecurists,
And offer it a holocaust
To prating, prudish, purists !
Why leave the beaten path, thick strewn
With the dead season's traces,
To brand three lucky men whose lines
Have fallin in pleasant places ?
With centenarians to record,
Toads-in-coal, piscine showers,
*The viper that bolts weasels whole,
The pike that “ browns” devours :
With all that for quotation yearns,
In proud provincial journals-
With all the Yankee nuts to crack,
Rich in dead-season kernels :-
With fruit, crops, tourists' grievances,
And social ills to howl of,
Two harmless sinecurist swells,
And a Lord, why fall foul of?
What had LORD TRURO, Or LE BLANC,
Or VILLARS MEYNELL done,
That thou, oh, Times, should'st show them up
Three job-masters in one ?
Was 't that some briefless barrister,
Flat leaders doomed to brew,
When fain peak, pass, and glacier,
He had been free to “do,
Felt savage, thinking of these three
Paid but to take their pleasure,-
Seven thousand pounds per annum shared,
To feed their lucky leisure ?
Was 't private wrath or public zeal
Most served to make him sore ?
Was 't that he loved the jobbed-for less,
Or the job hated more?
Boots not to ask: the job is there,
The show-up true and telling,
And TRURO, MEYNELL, and LE BLANC,
Stand like trees marked for felling!

A pleasant place art thou-
Nay more, three pleasant places rolled
In one great job, I trow.
Five clerks, four under, one their chief,
And ten for copying paid
Of Middlesex's registry
For lands bought, leased, conveyed,
Do all the work, and take in fees,
Twelve thousand pounds and more;
Whereof three thousand they retain,
And pay seven thousand o'er,
To the three blessèd Registrars,
Who sit, serene, on high,
Like gods of Epicurus, perched
Above our workday sky:
Who toil not, but take toll of men,
Hard-labouring men below,
And smile as murmurs and complaints
From their inferiors flow.
So sit LORD TRURO and LE BLANC,
And MEYNELL, each a god,
Their work, to pocket quarterly
Five hundred pounds and odd.
THE WEATHER, THE CROPS, AND THE COUNTRY.
THERE has been a good deal of weather about lately.
There was some very bad wethers in Sussex, but the Inspector had
them killed at once.
A lady, who has taken to farming, has separated the beans from the
other vegetables, on account of their being so broad.”
A French Bean has been hired by an agriculturist in the neighbour-
hood of Colwell-Hatchney, to give lessons in his native language,
A labourer in the north, who began his iniquitous career by robbing
his master of pig-iron, has now been transported for pig-steeling.
Farmers are saving up their money to buy sewing-machines for
next year. Women are to be employed on the work, who will chiefly
be engaged in sewing tares.
A Kentish agriculturist has composed a new harvest song, with an
appropriate chorus ; the burden is -
Hop light Loo,
And sow your pretty wheat."
Chorus. " Rye fol de riddle.”
A gentleman farmer, who is something of a logician, writes to us
to say that he considers the due springing up of the corn after the
sowing of the seed, to be a clear illustration of the “Doctrine of Corn-
sequences.”
FUNEBRAL FINERY.
Among the “ toilettes ravissantes” to be seen at a French watering-
place, a Paris newspaper describes this sweetly pretty novelty :-
“Le bas de la jupe orné de têtes de morts, imprimées sur la mousseline."
Cette fantaisie funèbre," as the writer nicely terms it, 'might be
thought somewhat appropriate, if the wearer were in mourning : and,
as novelty is charming, we may see death's heads embroidered, not on
the skirt merely, but all over the dress. Crossbones might be also
used by way of decoration, and coffins might be deemed a fitting kind
of ornament for a funeral costume. As a check upon their gaiety, the
Egyptians used to set up a skeleton in their banquet rooms : but
if we chanced to sit at dinner by a lady in a dress with a téte de mort
embroidery, we doubt if our politeness would be able to prevent a
laugh at her bad taste.
A Pottle of Poetry.
It is said that an Italian poet has written a poem of nine hundred

A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PILLORY.
THERE are not a few reflecting persons who lament the abolition of
the Pillory. They think, if that structure were still in being, it would
form an admirable frame for the face of the small tradesman, but great
rogue, who is addicted to the use of false weights and measures. It is
their opinion that such a face, so framed, would form an excellent sub-
ject for a photograph to be distributed amongst the rogue's neighbours,
and that it would also present a suitable target for volleys of eggs,
constituting a merited ovation.
That the moral exposure, at least, of every such rogue is extremely
desirable, nobody will deny or doubt except himself and his fellows.
Towards this no good at all is done by the mere enumeration, with
respect only to their several callings, of a lot of rogues who were
brought to justice and fined. Nobody derives much gratification, or
any advantage, from the simple announcement of a list of anonymous
rogues. In every case of convictions for cheating of any sort, a nominal
catalogue of the offenders ought to be made public, and moreover their
addresses should be given as well as their names, for the information
of those who, without it, might deal with them, and perhaps not take
the precaution of looking very sharp after them.
Mr. Punch has much pleasure in recommending to journalists in
general for imitation, the excellent example furnished by the Morning
Post in publishing, on Thursday, September 12, a full, true, and
particular Return, made to the vestry of St. Pancras, by MR. GEORGE
COLLINS, foreman to the Weights and Measures Committee, of persons
amerced in penalties incurred by them for using false weights and
scales in that parish. It will be found in Page 2 of our fashionable
and serviceable contemporary, column 4, at the bottom. Note these
points. The addresses as well as the names of all the cozeners,
together with the particulars of their several frauds, are carefully
specified, so as to enable their neighbours and all other persons in any
danger of becoming their customers, to know whom they have got to
trust to-which, of course, they will do no farther than you could
throw a bull by the tail.
BY THE SEA.
(A Grumble of September.)
ELL! London may be dull,
With the dulness of Sep-
tember;
Or dark and suicidal
With the fog-wreaths of
November.
But the dulness of her
autumn,
And her winter's miserie,
Are lively to the dulness
And suffering—by the sea !
With the snobs on the
parade
I'm not inclined to mingle:
I can't get up Platonics
With the nurse-maids on
the shingle.
I'm sick of the hot cliff-
walk,
I'm tired of shrimps at
tea;
Bored to death with barrel-organs
And brass-bands—by the sea !
And if such out-door pastimes
And pleasures leave me weary,
Indoors, at Sea View Cottage
Existence is more dreary.
Where the only thing that's living,
Is the sharp F or flat B,
About the flabby pillow
At our lodging-by the sea !
They tell me sea-air 's tonic;
They bid me seek the briny;
Dip my head till I am stifled,
Rub my body, till I'm shiny.
But I've no taste for sewage,
Diluted though it be,
And that's the sort of brewage
Supplied us-by the sea !
The papers come in late,
And the letters go out early :
The butcher is extortionate,
The poulterer is surly.
The fish comes down from London,
And stale is apt to be ;
The fishers they hook human flats-
Not flat-fish-by the sea.
'Gainst the cheating of the natives
My day is one long struggle :
They've ta’en to highway robb’ry,
Since they have ceased to smuggle;
And their harvest is the season-
And the crop they clear is me ;
And I'm grist between the mill-stones
Of the millers-by the sea.
If longer here I linger,
WINSLOW knows what I may be !
I may mope into an idiot,
Or maunder to a baby :
Become a human jelly-fish,
Or sea anemone,-
As soon in an aquarium
Exist, as by the sea !
My wife may call me selfish,
And read me Caudle-lectures,
On my private grounds for bolting
Indulge in harsh conjectures :
Blest if I stand it longer-
In town to-night I'll be,
Better London in September,
Than a week more by the sea.

This for That.
What a ludicrous change the alteration of a single word would
sometimes make! An evening paper remarks that " They (the upper
classes) must, at whatever cost, and with whatever labour, inoculate
the constituencies with their own ideas,” &c. Try the substitution of
vaccinate (the more modern practice too) for “inoculate."

DURING the vacation Ministers will have time to con.
sider and determine whether, in the ensuing. Session of
Parliament, they will bring forward any legislative measure
for the abatement of Ritualism, and, if any, what. In
the event of their resolving to propose an anti-Ritualistic
enactment, perhaps they may think it advisable to discou-
rage rather than absolutely to prohibit indulgence in excess
of ecclesiastical apparel. For this purpose could they
not, with advantage if not to the Church yet at least to
the State, have recourse to the expedient of imposing a
heavy tax on albs, copes, chasubles, stoles, and all other

THE ARREST OF SINALUNGA.
More in surrow than in anger."
Sad and yet stern, a firm but reverent hand
Italy lays upon her hero's arm,
Whose love for ber spurns Prudence's command,
And sees in polioy less help than harm.
In sorrow, not in wrath, she bids him pause,
Reminds him how e'en love law's rule must own:
How subjects must be subjects, be their cause
The purest, holiest, e'er to patriot known.
With love that thus love's urging countermands,
Patience that quenches Passion's fev'rish fire,
Sbe kisses, as she binds, the martyr's bands,
Who for THE CAUSE would kindle bis own pyre.
She honours her great prisoner, and his crime
Of love too eager, hope and faith too strong
To wait the mighty aids of Truth and Time-
Sure helps-if slow-whose work endureth long.

A FEAT FOR THE REFORM LEAGUE.
The Reform League, the other day, at the instance of
MR. BEALES, resolved on holding a meeting to express
their indignation at the arrest of GARIBALDI. This demon-
stration will doubtless exert some influence on Louis
NAPOLEON, who bas been the real cause of GARIBALDI's
arrest, by holding the Italian Government to the Sep-
tember Convention. With the view of compelling him to
release VICTOR-EMMANUEL's Cabinet from that compact,
the Reform League, with Beales at the bead of them,
should go and bold their meeting on GARIBALDI's behalf
in the Tuileries Gardens. Such a demonstration under the
nose of the EMPEROR OF THE FRENCI would not fail to
bave a due effect upon him, particularly if its authors

It is hardly necessary to tell Englishmen that Isaac Newton did
not steal any discoveries from PASCAL. You might as well say he
wrote Don Pasquale, or the Provincial Letters. Nor will Germans
make any mistakes on the subject. But other continentals are shame-
lessly ignorant about everybody but their own countrymen, and are
delighted to accept any story against an Englishman. Therefore
Mr. Punch signifies to Europe, and especially to Frenchmen, that a
recent impudent attempt to deprive NEWTON of some of his glory has
been proved to be based on a blundering forgery, of which only an
ignorant man could be guilty. _ Certain Frenchmen of science know
and loyally admit this, but few Frenchmen care to be either scientific
or loyal where an Englishman's renown is concerned, and therefore
this avertissement is given by Mr. Punch. BLAISE PASCAL was a great
man, and has reputation enough. NEWTON saw an apple fall, and
immediately thought of gravitation. Most Frenchmen, witnessing
the same sight, would have thought of making a beignet de pommes.

And given to the Popedom a chance it has not now.

Of temporal dominion for life he holds a lease.
The years it has to run yet at most can be but few.
That lease no bond obliges the Romans to renew.

AN IRREGULAR HARVEST ODE.
With corn from every corner of earth,
From Pau to Pesth, from Prague to Perth,
Let us hope we are safe from dearth.
Come then and liquor up,
Hundred and wapentake ;
Old age shall flicker up,
Strangers shall stop and take
In the guest-chamber,
Thirsty and sober,
Lucent and amber
Cups of October;
Drinking in house and hall,
Drinking to one and all,
Jolly with sụpper,
Good luck and benison-
Rhyme not in TENNYSON,
But maybe in TUPPER.
GRAND CHORALE.
So come, so come,
To the Harvest home;
Come, if you like,
With fife and drum,
There's a Volunteer band
Always at hand,
And flags and banners
In most of the manors-
But all of you come
To the Harvest home,
And shout and sing
Till the rafters ring,
And cheer for the sake of the corn in ;
And dance all night,
(But don't get tight)
And home by the train
in the morning,
Then ho ! for the great mill-wheel,
And the eels that lie on the bottom,
And ho! for the fisherman filling his creel,
Id est, when he has got 'em;
And heigh! for the whirring birds in stubble,
And ho ! for the hare that
must die or double,
And hey! for the day,
Not far away,
When the foxes find themselves in trouble.
STROPHE.
THE Harvest is over,
From Dantzic to Dover,
The Harvest is ended,
And not very splendid;
But still all ye rural and rustical peoples
Rouse the
ringers to ring Triple Bobs in the steeples,
Not omitting the towers ;
For sunshine and showers
Have brought you again to the end of your labours,
You, and your hard working classes, and neighbours,
So drink and be merry
With ale and with sherry,
Or anything handy,
Scotch whiskey or brandy,
But all things in order
On both sides the Border,
For each of us knows by experiment
'Tis well to be careful in merriment.
ANTISTROPHE.
Wheat, and barley, and rye,
On earth, and Ayr, and Skye,
Wherever the corn-crakes cry,
Wherever the partridges lie,
Sown and mown and cocked,
Sheaved and stooked and shocked ;
Reaped, and winnowed, and screened,
Ground and thrashed and gleaned ;
Ricked and stacked up high,
For the dusty miller to try,
And the Newark maltster to dry,
And all to eat and to drink by-and-by.
Oats, and beans, and peas,
From Thames, and Trent, and Tees,
And all the farms within the seas,
Scotia's Lochs to the House of Keys.
Golden, golden grain,"
From hill and valley and plain,
And all the wide champagne,
Browned by sun and “ lodged” by rain,
With here a speck and there a stain,
By many a maid and many a swain
Piled in cart, and waggon, and wain,
Crushing through thicket and spinney and lane,
To the great farm-yard with the creaking vane.
Golden, golden grain,
All to be gold again,
When the farmer takes the passenger train,
Or drives his mare with an easy rein,
Or trots on his cob to the market town,
And stands in the crowd in front of the “ Crown,"
And shows his samples, white and red,
To the miller who grinds the County bread;
And barley bright,
A beerful sight,
To the maltster who covers his malting floors
With the crops that waved on heaths and moors,
And rustled and rolled,
A sea of gold,
On Weald and Wold,
On Wold and Weald,
On fen and field,
An average yield-
But if it is under,
This line is a blunder,
And must be repealed.
GREAT ANTISTROPHE.
Corn in sacks,
Corn in stacks,
Corn on staggering peasantry's backs;
Corn in docks,
Corn in stocks,
Corn in barges passing through locks.
Corn from the north, corn from the south,
In spite of rain, and rust, and drouth,
Corn for everybody's mouth;
Corn from the east, corn from the west,
Corn from Bremen and corn from Brest,
From Riga, Russia, and Trieste ;

By bulbous roots,
By your last gathered load;
Rehearse, O friends,

PRETTY WORDS FOR PENNY READERS,
The art of calling a spade a spade is not much cultivated seemingly
by writers in cheap newspapers. Here, for instance, is a passage from
a leader upon pheasant shooting from a contemporary :-
“A pheasant, a goodly, and a beautiful sight it is to see the spangled exotic of
our woods come crashing down into the hazels or the ferns, like the broken end of
a rainbow, or a piece of damaged jewellery, while the echo of the shot rings through
the autumn woods."
Spangled exotic! We wonder what our cook would say if we begged
her to roast for us a spangled exotic. Perhaps we ought to add, that
we desired it to be served with staff-of-life sauce. Still more we
wonder what would be the exclamation of our gamekeeper if, when
next we beat a covert, we told him that we hoped to bag ten brace at
least of broken ends of rainbows! From the use of such fine language
one would think some of our newspapers import their tall talk from
America.
Another Episode in Insect Life.
The lower creatures in this country appear to be making wonderful
progress, to be developing rapidly. The common insects are becoming
mathematicians. An advertisement of a serial work on British Moths
informs us that Numbers Four to Ten contain the Geometers.

by patting anybody on the shoulder while talking-he has a pocket fuli
of them. A light breaks in on me. Have I been walking about

in which the Policeman, at a short distance, joins, “only down High

adds in intense enjoyment of the joke.
Are they all off, now?” I demand, sternly.
Oh, yes,” he replies, " they're all off now; won't hurt your coat
a bit.” I tell him it is not my coat, but my character, that he injares.
And now, being at the door of the Factory, I will not take him unless
he gives me his word to be quiet. He pretends to be very much hurt
by my distrust, makes a great show of crying, and sobs out like a child,
"Please-Sir-1 (sob) won't (sob) do it again!" (sob, sob, sob), and
attracts the attention of the Foreman, who is coming down the yard.
He holds me a minute. “ Here's some fun,” he says. I ask what
it is. He replies, “ Look here: if you'll call me ‘My Lord' all over
the Factory, I promise to be quite quiet and serious.” As this is a
very harmless jest, and one which really won't sound badly with these
manufacturing people, I agree. Anything to keep him quiet. He
immediately becomes very upright, buttons his coat, allowing a little of
his handkerchief to ooze out, as it were, from his breast pocket under-
neath (this is his idea of a Lord), and poses himself in the attitude of
what he calls, “Portrait of a Gentleman.'
The Foreman is ready to take us in. This way, my Lord,” I say
to him, according to agreement. The Foreman is impressed.
He frowns upon me, and answers in a deep tone, “Proceed, Mr.
Inspector. I trust that I may have to give the Government a satis-
factory account of your conduct." I smile, to show him I appreciate
the joke. He resumes, severely, “Do not smile, Sir! this is no time
for levity.” He repulses me, on my attempt to expostulate with him
about not carrying the joke too far," and adds distinctly and more
severely than before, “ No, Mr. Inspector, I will have no ex parte
statements. Any dereliction of your duty I shall be compelled to
report to the Government."
The Foreman hears this, and so do several of the Factory officials.
They eye one another as we enter, and I begin to regret my compact
with my Funny Friend.
So methinks Mr. Punch can't do better
Than follow the Synod's example,
And put forth his encyclical letter-

And most vital of organisations.
If the Bishops were all of one mind;
If the Bishops' one mind were the right one ;
If black Church or white we could find ;
If each Church weren't a black and a white one;
If of clerics the Church were composed ;
If the laity hadn't a say in't ;
If all truth in one volume were closed;
If only the Priest knew his way in't :
If Capetown were certainly right;
If ČOLENSO were proveably wrong;
If Sam Oxon's soft-sawder held tight;
If Denison's logic were strong ;
If Rational question were sin ;
If Ritual roads were salvation ;
If Priestcraft had nothing to win,
If the Pulpit supplied inspiration :
If with Heathen we were not o'er-run ;
If missions weren't needed at home;
If the Church and the School were at one ;
If the worst of our dangers were Rome
If Science through Church specs would read;
If Greed would to preaching give ear ;
If the poor found the Church fit their need ;
If the wealthy the devil would fear :
If curates were decently paid ;
If paupers in germ had good schooling;
If polemical hates were allayed ;
If sense restrained clerical fooling ;
If bishops were more like St. Paul;
If Truth to all kens were one colour ;
If the beam in our eyes were more small;
If our sense of our brother's mote duller :
If all of these "ifs" could be gained,
Then to Lambeth we all might betake us,
To its mitres pay rev'rence unfeigned,
And all that they would let them make us.
But while these “ifs” “ifs" must remain,

Dead letters your letters remain,
Your resolves only serve to amuse us.

A SONG OF THE SYNOD.
“ Great virtue in an if,"
TOUCHSTONE.
THE Pan-Anglican Synod has met;
The Pan-Anglican Synod has parted :
Lambeth's board has for forty been set :
Hosts of clerical hares have been started.
Colonial mitres and Yankee
Have wagged PRIMATE LONGLEY's beside,
And earned a most unctuous “ thankee,”
From the Bench with whose call they've complied.
Its stout northern pillars withdrawn,
(York don't like to play second fiddle),
Our Bench, on the broad of its lawn
Might have come down, split up in the middle.
But thanks to rough-hewn Yankee props,
And supports from Colonial quarters,
It has staved off undignified drops-
Said its say, and kept out the reporters.
But though access to short-hand 's refused,
Except for the "authorised version,"
Some whisperings out-doors have oozed,
Of collision and counter assertion.
How Bishops through trouble and tiff
,
Having found out what “ being at
, sea” meant,
Have learnt the great virtue of “if,"
As a means of securing agreement.
Thus since they'd to settle Natal,
And Natal isn't easy to settle,
Since COLENSO St. Davids might call
Very much what the pot called the kettle.
They adopt Convocation's decree,
Against that misleader of Zooloos-

And so saves from owning a screw loose.
THE HANGMAN'S PRACTICAL DIRECTOR.
The following remarks, in a letter addressed to the Lancet.by Dr.
TUKE, on the question to hang or not to hang an alleged maniac under
sentence of death, deserve consideration :-
“ If, after due examination, he be pronounced sane, let him undergo his deserved
punisbment; if insane, send him to a criminal asylum: or, if the law inexorably
demands his life, let him be hung as a declared 'madman.'"
Your alternative, Dr. Tuke, is the thing to do. Hang everybody
who commits murder, whether he is mad or sane. If any madmen are
murderers, hang all such madmen. Never mind the motives of crimi-
nals, look' only to their acts; retributive justice is sentimental bosh.
You punish a convict for the crime which he has committed simply
to deter others from committing the same, and to deter himself also
from doing it again; or to prevent him, in case you hang him. Hang
every man who has done what the law calls murder; hang him with
the sole view of getting rid of him and constituting him a scarecrow,
In that case hang a madman with no more scruple than you would
have to hang a mad dog. This has got of late to be a fashionable
preachment on the part of some public instructors. Very well. But
if these counsels are to be followed, first legalise their practice. Be it
enacted, then, duly and formally enacted, that everyone convicted of a
crime capitally punishable shall be hanged whether he is a madman or
not. Suppose we agree that expediency shall be the object exclusively
regarded in the infliction of punishment, and righteousness be set
altogether aside; only, in the meanwhile, let a declaratory Act of
Parliament definitely ordain that the former only shall be consulted,
and that the latter shall not be considered at all in sending a man to
the gallows.

The small birds strain their throats;

With flowery hues, defying dearth,
And scent per scent bestows:

AMERICAN BEGGARDOM.
Punch studies all the American newspapers. Hence the mingled
grandeur and jocosity of his style. The last American Journal which
he has studied is the Philadelphia Enquirer, in the advertising columns
whereof he finds something to note. This is a circular in behalf of a
gentleman named PESTER, whom his friends purpose to
Alderman” for a region called Roxborough. Run for Alderman does
not mean that the civic candidates race each other for the honour;
this would scarcely be aldermanly. It only means that MR. PESTER is
to be put up for election. And he is recommended for these reasons :-
1. Because he is good hearted, and a free giver to all worthy objects.
“ 2. He is the widow's friend.
“ 3. He is a friend to the poor man.
“4. You can trust him to collect money for you; you will be sure to get it.
“5. He was the soldier's friend when at the front.
“6. He is a friend to all the churches, without distinction of name or creed.
“7. His office is situated in the centre of Roxborough, where it is convenient.
“8. He is a sober, hard-working man, and minds his own business."
We are not quite so plain-spoken as this in England, though a good
many elections are decided upon grounds like those on which MR.
Pester's fame reposes.' Out of these eight reasons six set forth that
he is good to Mendicants. Objects beg of him, Widows beg of him,
Poor Men beg of him, You beg him to beg for you, Soldiers beg of him,
Preachers beg of bim--and his office, seventhly, is convenient for all

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CURRAGH
WREN.
It was on a merry time,
When CURRAGH WREN was young,
So neatly as she danced,
And so sweetly as she sung!
PRIVATE CROSSBELTS won her
With his coat of red,
He doffed his cap to JENNY,
And thus to her he said :
“My dearest JENNY WREN,
If you will but be mine,
You shall eat nice Curragh-pie,
And drink nice Curragh-wine.”
Jenny listened to him,
And declared her mind :
“Pretty Mr. Soldier,
I take your offer kind."
His corps it got the route,
Her soldier marched away,
Poor JENNY WREN she followed him
For all his saying, “Nay.”
Now in the furze-bushes,
Girl-beasts in a den,
With five others like her,
Herds CURRAGA WREN.
Infamy her darkness,
Misery her day;
Whiskey and starvation
Eating life away.
Spring east winds to blench her,
Summer heats to tease,
Autumn rains to drench her,
Winter snows to freeze.
CURRAGH WREN falls sick,
CURRAGH WREN must lie,
With the girl-beasts round her,
Watching till she die.
Then the coroner's jury
Sits on CURRAGH WREN,
Brings in “God's visitation”
Not villany of men.

Thou liftest thy finger-enough is the show,
For Italy yields to the threat of a blow.
And ought we not, therefore, thy praises to sing,
For guarding the crown of our Pontiff and King ?
How generous, how noble espousing our cause,
Whilst we and our Chief curse thy maxims and laws.
Denounce and condemn, with one heart, soul, and voice,
What gave thee thy sceptre—the people's free choice !
We hate French philosophers--all that they teach-
And French civil

And France's religious equality, ban-
Yet when we want soldiery, thou art our man !
No thanks for the troops for our sway that have bled-
No thanks for the blood thou wouldst yet bave them

No thanks on our subjects for thrusting our rule,
Thyself and thy people thereby to befool.
Our thanks are for those who of French souls have care,
And know how to work the Confessional chair :
Whom thou dost not dare, for thine empire, offend-

When shams" are all the fashion !
For oh! what innocence was mine,
When MARY JANE appeared divine,
With those fictitious dimples !
How little did I dream that art
The bloom of roses could impart
To what I know is-pimples !
With falt'ring voice and accents low,
I swore eternal love; but, oh!
In time I came to search her,
And found that all my hopes and fears
Had fallen on adhesive ears-
Of coloured gutta-percha!
O Woman! Woman! Man must know
How false you are from top to toe!
In vain you take a pleasure
In what may please the fashion's eye, -
Forms rounded by a purchased lie,
A falsehood made to measure !
O Woman! If, as we are told,
Girls nowadays are bought and sold,
Without of shame a particle ;
If marriage is reduced to be
A mercantile expediency-
One ought to get the Article !
But what have I to cheer my life?

All sorts of folly made for!

I find it but an empty shell,
And that I haven't paid for!

Among the many strikes which we lately have been witnessing, we
really wonder that we have not seen announced a strike of Governesses.
As a rule, they are extremely, overworked and underpaid, and have
really far more cause for striking than the tailors. Still, there seems
but little prospect of our seeing them on strike while we find them
putting forward such advertisements as this :-
A SINGLE LADY, aged 36, with a limited income, offers £20 per
annum and two hours' daily instruction to one or two Children in English and
the rudiments of music and French, in return for her BOARD.
We have often known a Governess content with a small salary, but
it is a novelty to hear of one content with less than nothing, and even
offering to pay a yearly premium for her place. An income which is
limited may fail to satisfy the cravings of an appetite which is not :
still, unless this single lady be uncommonly voracious, she need
scarcely, one would fancy, offer £20 a year, and two hours' teaching
daily, merely for her board.

MARVELLOUS EVENT AT HULL.
On Monday last week, at the Town Hall, Hull, a statue of ANDREW
MARVEL was consecrated; invested with a new office by solemn rites.
At least, a newspaper report says that it was 'inaugurated”
JOHNSON's Dictionary. Of MARVEL's statue we may pretty safely
venture to say that it is a marvellous work of Art. Almost every
specimen of British sculpture is that; but we trust that Mr. W. D.
KEYWORTH's statue of MARVEL is a marvellously good one, and repre-
sents him as faithfully as he represented Hull.
This Marvel was a prodigy of integrity. Marvels, they say, will
never cease ;
but such as ANDREW MARVEL have now become very
uncommon. Why was ANDREW MARVEL like the celebrated mineral
teeth advertised by dentists ? Because he was incorruptible. A
duplicate of his statue might be subscribed for, by his admirers, and
set up in the borough of Great Yarmouth.
HOW TO CLOAK A MEANING.
MR. LUCRAFT, with some other Councillors of the Reform League
having brought down a storm on their heads by talking disloyalty in
the shape of sympathy with Fenianism, the Council has since tried to
undo the effect of their seditious stuff by a very proper resolution,
which, however, it did not come to a vote upon, “ that the League does
not counsel private assassination, or secret political assassination." In
the course of the discussion MR. MANTLE gave an explanation of MR.
LUCRAFT's language-"that MR. LUCRAFT has a singular way of saying
things that other people understand in a different sense from that in
which he meant them. This may be irony, or it may be earnest. Let
us call it flinging the League's Mantle over MR. LUCRAFT.
That England can't be caught with chaff,
Her millions fooled with praises,
Cozened by Asian mysteries,
And fed on windy pbrases :
That impudence awhile may thrive,
But earns, at last, a licking :
And that the brass which gulls an ass,
Sets 'cuter creatures kicking.
Learn, BOB, from Ben, to manage men,
By humouring their folly,
Nor rub weak wits against the grain,
Till their hair 's sharp as holly :
That truth's point may be cut too fine,
Too hard thrust down folk's throttles ;
That if you'd store strong wine, 'tis wise
To allow for flaws in bottles.
That one-half of a truth, at times,
Is better told than all of it:
That wisdom 's sometimes wise to yield,
When folly takes the wall of it :
That to tread on weak brethren's toes
Is rude, e'en the best cause in,
May trip the treader up, and oft,
À fair career give pause in.
P. O. Queries.
"The postal duty for a simple letter to or from America has been fixed by the
Reichstag Committee at one silvergrosh.”
This is the news from Berlin. How do the Prussian post office
authorities ascertain whether a letter is simple or otherwise ? By
opening and reading it? And is the postage on a simple letter
heavier than on a wise one, or the reverse ? And does the rate of
postage on letters in other countries, England for example, depend
upon their simplicity ?
Euphemism Extraordinary.
A LAWYER of our acquaintance, who has acquired great skill in con-
ducting an election, declares that in the course of his canvassing
experience he never heard a bribe even distantly alluded to, excepting
by the synonym of a “votive offering."

MIRACLES OF MECHANISM.
This is good :
“I understand tbat bis Holiness has visited the wounded and the
prisoners, and has taken so much interest in the events of the day,
that he had the mechanism of the Chassepot rifle explained to him
by a French soldier the other day when he passed through the
Popolo gate to the Borghese Villa."
Thus writes the Roman correspondent of the Post.
Considering whose Vicar the POPE calls himself, and is
supposed to be by his spiritual subjects, he must, whilst
having the mechanism of the Chassepot rifle explained to
him by a French soldier, have presented a somewhat edi.
fying spectacle to the faithful bystanders. Fancy the
Representative of the Prince of Peace attending with
interest to instruction in tbe mechanism of a breech-
loader ! So occupied he should bave been sketched for an
historical picture. The curiosity of the Holy Father,
however, is quite intelligible. He knew that the Chasse-
pot rifle had“ done wonders” for the temporalities of
the Holy See. He naturally wished to know the con-
trivance by means of which those wonders were wrought.
People who are credibly informed of any wonders mostly
do. There are those who deny that the age of miracles is
past. Certainly the wonders of the Chassepot rifle appear
to have been the only sort of miracles of late done for the
Papacy. A few years ago we used to hear of others.
Certain pictures and statues, for example, winked and
made faces. Now, one good turn deserves another. The
POPE knows, or at least ought to know, by what
machinery the grimaces of those images were occasioned.
His Holiness has had the mechanism of the Chassepot
rifle explained to him. Will he, in return, be so kind as to
explain the mechanism of the winking Madonna of Rimini ?

A Man of Two Months.
THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH has been called the Man

Nation. On Monday the fourth instant the Elect of the

nation. He has now, then, earned a right to be called also

greet the captives, and were met by a long train of the wounded.

OPEN thy gates, O Rome, to those that come, -
Open thy gates and let the vanquished in,
Thus-with no measured sound of fife and drum-
Thus-with no ransomed people's joyous din,
Silently meet thy conquered children, Rome!
This is their welcome to their ancient home!
To Porta Pia, down the paven road,
Go forth the crowds to meet the dreary train, -
Wearily drag the waggons with their load
From the bright hills across the dusty plain ;
Those hills from whence they watched St. Peter's dome,
And dreamed, that they were waited for in Rome.
And Rome waits for them.-By the long, dead walls,
Where bides Torlonia's Villa with its state,
From where the water in the Piazza falls
To the low cypress by St. Agnes gate
Romans, by tens of thousands, watch to-day,
And crowd the stones of the Nomentan way.
Poor was the victory-little is the show,
Lo! Rome's deliverers-wounded beggar-boys !
When Romans, richer, older, wiser grow,
They think of winter-trading and the joys
Of piled polenta. Let the Pope remain-
And let his subjects make their righteous gain !
Yet there is something stirring in their heart
For those who fought to conquer or to die.
No cheers. French bayonets are not far apart, -
Yet, as the moaning freights go slowly by
Each head uncovers. So they enter Rome-
Their prize erewhile--their prison now-their home.

Thy priests, God's servants ? and thy people free?
And will thy children ever learn to fear

Hopeless our hope! Thy lowest fall is now;
Shrine of long memories, happy are thy dead.
Blest are the wounded captives lying low-
Bat thou art fallen—thy earthly light is filed.
“ Ilicet." All that made thee great is gone-
Our only reverence is for earth and stone.
If thou art desert in the future times
If daisies in the DORIA's palace grow;
If ivy round thy RAPHAEL'S Loggie climbs,

JUSTICE'S TWO SCALES.
“Two respectably-connected youths-AUGUSTUS Higgs, aged nine,
and WILLIAM GREENWOOD, aged thirteen-convicted of stealing from
the stalls of the Crystal Palace, and remanded in order that their
medical attendant might prove they were afflicted with epileptical
kleptomania,' were yesterday again brought up before MR. ELLIOTT,
at Lambeth, when some medical evidence appears to have been given
as to the nature of this strange malady. All we can gather from the
newspaper report is, that one of the boys was subject to fits, but we
are still left in the dark as to the connection between epilepsy
and kleptomania. MR. ELLIOTT said he felt a difficulty in dis-
posing of the case on account of the youth of the boys, that he was
bound to deal with them as if they had been common little boys not
respectably connected, and then dismissed them with an admonition.”

FROM OUR FOREIGN OFFICE.
EUROPE has discerned the possibility
of a provisional arrangement which
will terminate in a solution of the
Roman question.
The Holy Father declares that he
must absolutely maintain his non pos-
sumus as far as regards the territorial
demands of Italy.
It is added, on authority, that his
Holiness is bound by his oath, but he
considers it by no means impossible
that his successor should enter into
negotiations with the Italian Kingdom.
On this point the sentiments of the
Holy Father are in accord with those
of M. PUNCH. The eventuality con-
templated by his Holiness is not im-
possible. Nevertheless the endeavour
of the approaching Conference must
be to take the requisite precautions
that it shall not occur.
Those precautions will centre in the
careful provision that the successor of
the Sovereign Pontiff shall succeed
him only in his Pontificate.
The temporalities of the Holy See,
on the demise of the Tiara, will be
guaranteed to the Kingdom of Italy.
Thus the circumstances under which
non possumus could be the rejection of
an overture will have ceased to exist.
The Powers will not reproduce the
situation.
Italy, confident and tranquil, will
afford to wait for a reversion secured
on a legal basis.

For, by the way he cocked his bat,
And wore each careful rag,
And by the sign of this and that,

But how I cannot guess.

He turned his elbows out, and let
His bands hang from the wrist;
“He is," said I," for any bet,

in some cases, but this can hardly pay bim for the extra time and labour they
involve. Sometimes as many as eighty patients are submitted to his care; and,
as his work upon the average takes two hours every day, he receives the splendid
salary of eighteen-pence an hour, which is less pay than a chimney-sweep's for
cleaning, a foul flue. Out of this large sum, however, he has to find the drugs for
the medicine he dispenses; and, unless he chooses to be largely out of pocket, the
black doses he makes up had need be cheap, as well as nasty.
Blackguardians may say that physic good enough for porkers is quite good
enough for paupers ; and, while they keep their poorhouses as filthy as their pig-
styes, no doubt they will consider that invalided paupers should be cured about
as cheaply as invalided pigs. Indeed, we really are surprised that they should go
to the expense of a regular practitioner, even although they pay him such starva-
tion fees as those we quote above. A veterinary surgeon would surely be quite
good enough to look to the infirmities of those who, in most poorhouses, are treated
as mere beasts.

Why should small people complain of the dearness of provisions when the upper

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LORD DERBY intimated that though by international law we had
only to deal with the QUEEN's subjects, it would be “lamentable” to
leave missionaries and their children in captivity, and Sir ROBERT
NAPIER knew what to do. This wink, wunk by LORD DERBY, seems
sufficient.
The Abyssinian business was settled, and then LORD RUSSELL asked
about the Conference.
LORD DEBBY said that his noble relative (his son) had said to France
that he should be happy to confer; but, without a basis and an under-
standing that decisions were to be accepted, it would be useless.
In the Commons we had a free fight on Abyssinia, everybody ven-
tilating some notion of bis own, and pitching into everybody else for
being so foolish as not to see the truth as it was. The Lost Letter
was talked of, and Mr. LAYARD thought it of very little consequence,
MR. BERNAL OSBORNE thought it of a good deal, and smartly said
that the postage of that letter would cost us £5,000,000.
COLONEL SYKES hit the nail which Mr. Punch inserted into the
question last week, and made some very awkward remarks about
Egyptian raids and Abyssinian ladies. The whole affair had been a
system of bungling from beginning to end. Yes, and something worse
than bungling. Mr. Punch could be at once diffuse and sledge-
hammerish upon this subject; but as the war has begun and must
go on, the wiser way is to cry booray, and applaud MR. CHANCELLOR
OF THE EXCHEQUER when he cries to Mr. John BULL to tuck in his
two-penny (that is, to pay his twopence increased tax), and vaults
gallantly over the head of the good-natured old fellow. But Mr. Punch
reserves his right to make a row hereafter.
MR. LAYARD did not want to be uncivil to DR. BEKE, and withdrew
anything said in anger, and substituted the allegation that the doctor
made statements without any foundation.
SIR S. NORTHCOTE said that MR. SEYMOUR FITZGERALD, Governor of
Bombay, was for a smaller, and SIR ROBERT NAPIER for a larger force.
There were many other speakers, but their words need not be im.
mortalised. Once again Mr. Punch remarks, “ Lethe is a brave river.”
Friday. There was a short sitting, and again the Abyssinian flavour
was imparted to the debate. It was conceded by LORD STANLEY that
some correspondence of a most objectionable character should be
published to gratify MESSRS. LAYARD and NEWDEGATE.
To-night Her Majesty's Theatre was burned down, and Parliament
sustained a severe blow. The distance from the House to the Opera
House was delightfully easy. Vale, Vale, NovoSIELSKI.
Saturday. The Abyssinian Session was over. We shall be glad to say

And show to fares benighted

St. Margaret's tombstones crossed are,
Came stealing on a Cabby,
And along with him a Coster.
Cabby in great-coat muffled
A handbill bore close folded ;
And the Coster as he shuffled,
At his side a paste-pot hold did.
Through the great hall they went creeping,
On to the Commons' lobby-
The door-keepers were sleeping,
And on duty snored the bobby!
Were they traitors thus intruding
On DENISON's dominions ?
Guy-Fawkeses blow-up brooding,
Or Greek-fire-breathing Fenians ?
Was there powder in the paste-pot,
And treason in the poster,
Which that Cabby from his waistcoat
Unfolding, showed that Coster.
A CARD TO CONSPIRATORS.
MR. JOHN BULL presents his compliments to his American Irish
enemies, and desires to know whether they see any green in his eye?
The reason which occasions MR. Bull to ask them this question is
their vehement declaration that nothing he can do for the conciliation
of Ireland will be of any avail, that Irishmen all hate and abhor him
utterly, and that no good that he may render them, how great soever,
will ever prevail upon them to acquiesce in being his fellow-subjects.
Suppose MR. BULL were to believe all this, what would he do?
Immediately rescind Roman Catholic Emancipation, re-enact the
penal laws, and re-establish Protestant ascendency. He would forth-
with proceed to undo all the good that he has done-and MR. BULL
takes note of the admission that he has done good of late in Ireland.
His endeavour would be to rule Ireland with a rod of iron. In short,
MR. BULL would adopt a course which would drive the Irish people
at large, and not merely a disaffected minority, into rebellion, and not
only that, but would justify their rebellion in the eyes of the whole
world.
MR. John Bull has no doubt that, if he took this course, he would
do just what his Fenian adversaries want him to. Instead of that, he
intends to persevere in doing the very best for Ireland that he possibly

Where his flock oft have mused, as their Bibles they fingered,
“How good would our warm-hearted Bishop, be, cold !”
What to him were short commons, wet jacket, hard-lying,
The savages' blood-feud, the elements' strife,
Whose guard was the Cross, at his peak proudly ilying,
Whose fare was the bread and the water of life?

convinced that in some instances—one black and sleek family in par-
ticular—the tails had been carefully curled for the occasion.
The Eland also was too much sought after to allow me a comfortable
inspection. There was a difference of opinion as to what he was. I
believe a cross between a camel and a buffalo was the favourite theory;
and an equal uncertainty existed as to his native clime,' some loudly
protesting-but then they were Scotch-that he must be a Heelander.
There were no calves; and lambs, I understood, were not in season.
You will expect minute descriptions of the machinery. You will be
disappointed, for if I was Ignoramus amongst the cattle, I was Igno-
ramissimus in the throng of implements, being one to whom the con-
struction of the ordinary squirt is an unrevealed secret, and the rela-
tionship between lock and key a hopeless puzzle. But there was
everything that a gentleman engaged in agricultural pursuits (modern
English for farmer) could desire to get credit for, from a steam-engine
to a sausage-machine, from pianos to pickles, from Kohl Rabi, which
must be a Hebrew root, to tenpenny Sauterne not an operation of agri-
culture but what was provided for and rendered easier, except, perhaps,
corn-cutting. There was a “ Village Phaëton," a mythological novelty;
there was a cheap and expeditious chaff-cutter-I longed to ask whether
it could cut jokes also; there was a dove-tailing machine, something
in the conjuring line, no doubt; there was the "Ecoscevephoron,
which might be a wild beast or an American drink; there were
“Whalebone and Gutta Peroha Jockeys," for anatomists and anthro-
pologists to study; there were "Straw Elevators,” which naturally
connected themselves, in my mind, with the exhilarating implements
used in Sherry Cobler; indeed, everything that has been produced
by the ingenuity of CLAYTON and SHUTTLEWORTH, and FOWLER, and
GARRETT, and HORNSBY, and HOWARD, and NICHOLSON, and RANSOM,
and dear old Mary WEDLAKE, and a hundred more was on view.
Have I anything to say about the visitors ? The farmers disap-
pointed me, they seemed to have shrunk and dwindled and lost girth,
but it was late when the duties of an arduous public appointment
allowed me to arrive, and the bulk of them had, perhaps, gone. The
days of my childhood came back to my recollection when I looked
once more on the old familiar smock-frock, but, alas ! not of the rich
blue we used to see at N-, May Fair; and—but hark! hush!
can it be! It is the Waits, the Belgravia Waltz-my pen drops from
my hand, I can write no more, except to add, that as I passed out from
the Show I felt that, after all the pains I had taken with the cattle, I

I've been to the theatres, I've seen Drury Lane,
And I do not mind saying I'd see it again.
From my seat in a loge,
I would hear Phelps's Doge,
And see him beheaded without any pain.
I've been to the Queen's,
And supped, after, at GREEN'S,
Which I needn't say means,
The Great Evans's Hall.
I've seen MR. BELMORE
(What acting could tell more !)
In a farce which they Up for the Cattle Show call,
Writ by a young gemmun
Whose surname is LEMON-
'Tis original, not from the Vaudevilles of Gaul.
I've seen one more farce
That made minutes pass
As pleasantly as one could wish them to go,
'Tis Highly Improbable,
Though from my nob able
To give the plot,
Yet, I will not ;
'Tis at the Royalty, if you would know.
There Miss BROMLEY,
Looks so comely :
And Miss ADDISON,
Oh, so glad is ’un,
To see her bright face,
Worth ten times my place
In the stalls whence I see six or eight other girls
In picturesques costumes, and chignons and curls.
Where next !
I’m perplexed,
I must not become triste;
On this week,
When I speak,
Falls the mark of the beast;
Not speaking profanely,
In other words plainly,
'Tis the time,
When the prime
Sheep and oxen are shown
At Smiffel. Away to the fat and the bone !
I see the fat beef,
I think what relief
These beasts would afford to a Farnham Work'us ;
And then my thoughts shift,
Then presently drift,
Down to Holborn among the train'd beasts in the Circus.
Bare-backed steeds,
Galloping round;
Muscular deeds
In air, on ground.
Acrobats,
Without any hats,
Come from that stage with its "pair of fats."
Over they vault,
A somersault,
Always safe and never a fault.
Marvellous folks,
Clowns with jokes,
And obstinate mokes;
A couple of poodles,
Far less of noodles,
Than many I see in the window of Boodle's.
And children all around were there,
Curly-haired, straight-haired, dark and fair,
Clapping their little hands with glee.
And thinking it all such an excellent spree,
They shouted with laughter left and right,
There never was a pleasanter sight.
