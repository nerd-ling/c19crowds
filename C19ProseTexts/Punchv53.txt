PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
!

PRE PACE
“BY
Y Corona Borealis et Corona Australis," said Mr. Punch, laying down the gorgeously artistic description by his
friend WILLIAM HOWARD RUSSELL, of the Hungarian Coronation, “ I will be crowned. I wonder I never thought
of it before. That's my modesty again. But I dare say the Universe expects it of me, and is afraid to say so. I
will be crowned.”.
“ Who is worthy to do it ?” said Mrs. Punch, indignantly.
“ Asked like a dutiful and adoring wife,” said her Lord. “ Take this cheque and buy yourself the biggest
diamond in London."
“I have it already," said Mrs. Punch, blushing. “I have you.
"
“ That is true," said Mr. PUNCH. “ Send the cheque to MRS. GLADSTONE, for her admirable Convalescent
Hospital, with my best wishes that many may do likewise. Who is worthy ? H’m. Yes, I know who. But I must
consult authorities. What says Mr. VINCENT, able editor of Haydn ?”
“ The first coronation he mentions," said Mrs. PUNCH,“ was that of MAJORIANUS, 457."
" Who the deuce was MAJORIANUS ? ” said MR. Punch. “ I know no more of history than SERJEANT GASELEE
does of geography."
"I think I remember reading about him in my GIBBON,” said Mrs. Punch. “ He was gentle to his subjects,
terrible to his enemies, and he excelled in every virtue, PROCOPIUS says,” added the docta conjux.
" He might have been describing me," said MR. PUNCH.
Nay,” said his wife," at least I should be more copious than PROCOPIUS, with you for a theme.”
“Best of women,” replied Mr. PUNCH,“ more authorities. Look into CHARLES Knight." ,
"I remember what he says,” said Mrs. Punch, modestly. “The Saxon Sovereigns were crowned at Kingston.
upon-Thames."
“ Not a bad place. They went over to Richmond afterwards, I suppose, and dined at the Star and Garter.”
“I think,” said Mrs. PUNCH, hesitatingly, “ that the Order was instituted rather later.”
“ So much the worse for the Saxon kings. Well ?”
" The ceremony of anointing was first used here in 872."

[JUNE 29, 1867.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“ I'll have none of that. Did I ever sing you Dr. Maginn's song on WILLIAM THE FOURTH's crowning ?” And
he sang out lustily-
I suppose all was right that Will HOWLEY has done,
That for oiling the king he has warrant divine,
But when I am the Primate, as sure as a gun
I shall hallow my King with a flagon of wine.
And let nobody think that a drop of the drink
On head or on bosom away I shall fling,
No, bemitred I'll stand, with the cup in my hand,
And I'll cry, 'Here, you beggars, three cheers for your king!'
“ As for kissing the girls —"
“My dear Lord,” said Mrs. PUNCH, “ consider the neighbours."
“ I do. I consider them fools, as LUTHER says, if they don't like song, especially mine. Anything else ?
“ The Coronation Oath"
“ By George, by Jove, by jingo, and by gum," as another great bard wrote, “I'll have no oaths. They hamper
a sovereign. Even that windbag, KING TURVEYDROP, was troubled by his oath-to be sure he could not understand it.”
“ The Liber Regalis has been, since EDWARD THE THIRD, the authority for coronation business here," said MRS.
Punch. “ It is kept with religious care in the archives of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.”
“Write to Dean STANLEY and ask him, with my regards, to send it me by the Parcels Delivery Company."
“ You will find its essence in STRUTT, dear."
“ Yes, I believe the essence of a coronation is in strut, dear,” said MR. Punch, laughing riotously.
That night he had a dream. It came through the gate of horn. He beheld himself, like the KING OF HUNGARY,
bestriding a magnificent steed, which stood on a mound composed of earth contributed by the four quarters of the
World. In fact, it was the World itself. And in his right hand was something which was not the Hungarian Sword,
but a mightier weapon. It was the Punch Pen! And gazing forth with lion courage and eagle keenness upon creation,
he waved with his Sword-Pen at the four points of the compass, and at each wave a Humbug howled and fell. And
the loyal cheers of innumerable and unseen crowds went up to the firmament.
Suddenly there was a dead silence. Then the silver trumpet voice of the Emperor of the World was heard :
“ There was but one worthy to crown me. I have crowned myself. In remembrance of this immortal day, I
bestow upon the world as immortal a boon. I present it with my
Fifty-Second Volume.

ment. This will show you are a free-born Briton,
and can do as you like.
When introduced to a French gentleman, thrust your
tongue into your cheek, and say familiarly, “Comment vous portez-
vous, vieux coq?” When you meet him again, exclaim, as the French
do, “Slap bang, voici nous encore !” This will serve completely to put him
at his ease, and show you are acquainted with the customs of the country.
Always when you can, walk in the middle of a street, and stare about as if tho houses
all belonged to you, and you were merely travelling to inspect your property.
To show that you were fortunately born in a free country, comment freely on whatever may
excite your laughter, and particularly at the queer names over the shop windows, supposing that their
owners can hear what you say.
When you hire a cab in Paris, you will do well to begin a conversation with the driver by calling him a “rcuge
gorge," the French for robin red-breast. Then you may please him by pleasantly inquiring, “Madame votre mère, sait-
elle que vous n'êtes pas chez vous ?" This will manifest a lively interest in his family, and prove you are not proud, as
Englishmen abroad are mostly thought to be.
On entoring a church, if you so far condescend as to take your hat off, do so with a gesture that signifies contempt. Strut noisily
about, and sarcastically criticise the pictures and the shrines, paying no heed to the worshippers who are on their knees before them.

BALLADS FOR BACHELORS.
THE BRIEFLESS TO HIS BOY !
Rufus ! my chambers thou may'st close,
Draw in the outer oak;
And from our labours let's repose-
Hang LYTTELTON and COKE!
My slippers find, my candles light,
My flute fetch from the press ;
But bring no books-for this one night
We'll give to idleness.
Oh, Rufus, in those awful tomes,'
How oft have I dug deep;
To hold dread converse with the gnomes
Who there pale vigils keep.
Thy day-dreams in an easy groove
Glide, checked by sorrows brief ;
Thy brain burns not a court to move,
Or bow before a chief.
While Juniors with each others spar,
At clubs in sham debate,
You long to practise at the bar
Which tops some rustic gate.
Thy mind ambition never racks,
And more delight you'd feel,
In netting humble stickle-backs,
Than bagging the great Seal.
To get silk with its charming gloss,
Long legal yarns we spin;
Your little games entail no loss-
At mine, heads only win.
Thou hast no reverence, I fear,
For shrines where learned dust is;
Nor would a fig give for the ear
Of even a Lord Justice.
Some ladies say I'm growing bald
With mental wear and tear;
'Tis scarce three years since I was called
To shun my native hair.
Hark! there's a knock-don't crush my wig

And mind ! if it's a guinea pig -

The world is another year older,
So are you, my young fellows and dears,
Never mind, whilst the old fogies moulder,
May you see many happy new years.
There is hope that you will, for in store you.
Health and wealth may be destined to find.
It may many years are before you,
And maturity isn't behind.

Can be happy-a truth to regret!
And whene'er an old friend you wish many,

All in vain 's the good wish of the season,
Would, indeed, you were able to say,
As on juvenile birthdays, with reason,
Many happy returns of the day!"

FIRST ANTIPHONE.
All the plagues of the season,
Thick and threefold are down on me:
Lord of Mis-rule and Un-reason,
Christmas doth frown on me.
My patience hath gone by the board,
Ridden over rough-shod :
One growth Christmas trees should afford,
And don't that's a rod!
SECOND ANTIPHONE.
Turkeys, plum-puddings, mince-pies !
Mis'rable sinner,
Must the sins of my youth arise
To make penance of dinner ?
Why should I tip the breed
Of brats, all about me ?
Why find Christmas boxes to feed
Harpies that scout me?
THIRD ANTIPHONE.
From dishes that ruin digestion,
From juvenile hops,
From wares readers should like a pest shun,
In the booksellers' shops :
From the coarse Christmas beef butchers kill,
With fat triple-lined;

When I hate human-kind-

With Rome accounts to square:
And a Papal Zouave, with rope
To hang himself in air.

ANNUS PLORABILIS.
In vain, Old Year, with summer shows
Thou striv'st to prank thy dying face,
Mocking with green the month of snows
Till winter wears spring's breath and grace.
A sorry year thou camest
in,
A sorrier year thou diest out;
Little 'twas thine for earth to win,
But death and dole, dismay and doubt.
At home, what have thy conquests been ?
What goodly sheaves thy garner fill ?
The many's cries, that little mean,
The few's retorts, ill-word for ill.
A battle, but no victory won
A problem set, but still to solve;
Loose arguments, the grasp that shun,
In vicious circles to revolve.
In high finance, in shares and stocks,
Swindling, collapse of credit wide,
A murrain on our herds and flocks,
With watchful Cholera at its side.
High Church, with Mumbo-Jumbo rites,
Stopping the road 'twixt man and heaven;
Low Church, content with Sabbath slights
Of Mammon, Lord six days in seven.
Death-dealing, e'en as it expired,
Thy breath spread ruin and dismay;
Kindled the spark the mine that fired,
Its hundreds at a stroke to slay.
Unto the palace of our pride,
And all its gathered treasures rare,
Thy dying hand the torch applied,
Ånd left a ruin blank and bare!
Abroad, at one another's throats
Kings letting loose the dogs of war ;
By armèd hosts, or doctored votes,
The nations' landmarks shifted far,
Soldiers in rivalry increased,
Till
nations into armies turn,
And Peace goes armed when War has ceased,
That scarce their difference you discern.
Shakings of thrones, kings hunted out;
Of race and blood strange throes in air ;
And throne of thrones, its props struck out,
All tottering, St. Peter's chair.
Go hence, Old Year, and hide thy head,
Leaving thy awful tasks undone
To the Young Year, with lightsome tread
And hopes
of youth that fears outrun !
ANNUS MIRABILIS.
The old year raised his dying head,
With pity in the glazing eye,
Though curses rang around his bed,
And not a loving look was nigh.
And all the angry tongues were hushed,
As with light like eve's after-glow
The sharpening features fired and flushed,
And he spake solemnly and slow.
“What metes have ye to mete my task?
What scales to weigh my good and ill ?
Is yours the verdict I should
ask
On what I leave or what fulfil ?
Fools ! that with the foot-rules of man
Think to gauge Him, who guides the spheres-
Whose voice, e'en through your buzz and ban,
Sounds audible for reverent ears.
“ Murrain and Plague'-Did not my hands
Bring blessing, even bringing these ?
Shake penny-wisdom, where she stands
Guarding the dirt that breeds disease.
Prove pestilence another name
For duty shirked, and work ill-done ;
Show where air, light, and water came,
How baffled Cholera must run.
“' Wars that shift land-marks, shatter thrones :
Armings of nations, far and wide'-
Is not seed fed on dead-men's bones,
Seed of large growths that shall abide ?
The year that made North-Germans one,
Swept Italy of aliens free,
Can show, besides these great things done,
Ground laid for greater things to be.
“Strange stirs of blood, new throes of race,
Seeking new order, spurning old '-
Is it so hard His hand to trace
In young loves lit, grey hates grown cold?
The year that laid, 'neath ocean wild,
The wires of peace, good-will to man,
'Twixt mighty mother, mighty child,
Is not a year to blame and ban.
" 'Battles of church and creed and class,
Roguery unmasked, and fraud laid bare'-
Does the storm end with storm, por pass
And leave behind a healthier air ?

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
To see MR. T. ROBERTSON'S play of Ours, which did much content
me. As at the New Royalty, in Meg's Diversions and Black Eyed Susan,
so here, the actors play thoroughly well together. The piece is of
course by this time an established success, and a genuine success too.
Ars celare artem, and, with one single stagey exception, this piece is so
thoroughly well acted as quite to remove from the spectator's mind the
notion that he is looking at acting. Of the exception I shall only say
that he is the tallest gentleman in the company, and the one who evi-
dently fancies himself most of all at his ease. The piece is well written,
but that alone wouldn't bave insured its great success, which I, there-
fore, feel myself justified in attributing generally to good stage manage-
ment. The author knows how to write for the stage, but, beyond this, he
is evidently capable of directing the actors how to play his piece. The
actors are to be praised for thoroughly carrying out the author's inten-
tions. I'll be bound that most actors, of any position at all, would
have thrown up the part of the Russian Prince in disgust.
I have also seen the Covent Garden Pantomime by GILBERT À
Beckett, whose first success will, for the sake of Auld lang syne, be
hailed by Mr. Punch with real pleasure. Great praise is due to
MESSRS. GRIEVE AND Matt MORGAN for the ingeniously designed
Transformation, which, however, is not so startlingly original as MR.
MORGAN's Clock in Cinderella. MRs. Wood is visible any Christmas
night at the Princess's, playing The Invisible Prince, and I can't but think,
that in a livelier part and a more bustling piece, she will prove herself a
very first-rate burlesque actress, in a special line of her own. The last
scene at this theatre is beautiful, and, with its cool groves and dripping
wells, is quite refreshing after the gorgeous fiery displays at the larger
houses.
Controversial Query.
The Ritualists draw arguments in favour of the celibacy of the
clergy from the most ancient ecclesiastical writers. How can they
consistently appeal in such a case as this to those who, on all hands,
are admitted to have been Fathers.

A RECOMMENDATION TO RITUALISTS.
A DREADFULLY intolerant law prohibits Roman Catholic
priests from going about in their sacerdotal costume, on
the wretched pretence of preventing a no-Popery row and
breach
of the peace. But no such law restrains the clergy
of the Established Church from perambulating the streets
and thoroughfares in their canonicals.
It is therefore extremely desirable, for the propagation
of Puseyism, that Anglo-Catholic diviņes should fully avail
themselves of their privilege to march in procession, attired
in their rubrical vestments in the very height of the fashion
which the law allows. They will do well to carry plenty of
ecclesiastical banners, emblems, and images, particularly a
Madonna and a bambino at their head.
By frequent recourse to this expedient for converting
the British Public, they will at least succeed in securing
numerous followers among the juvenile part of the popula-
tion, for the boys will follow them.

And cool, “Modern Athens,” self-styled.
Where in wordy-duello encountering his fellow-
A DEMOSTHENES each, with the stones-
On Democracy's bane and Democracy's gain,
Ding-dong at it went BLACKIE and JONES.
First BLACKIE went in determined to win,
Or, O'CONNOR-like, die on the floor :
And with ink from the bottle of old ARISTOTLE
Daubed the ancient Democracies o'er :
Proclaimed himself foeman of Cicero's Roman,
Picked Italian republics' old bones :
Made France sorrow sup, and the Yankees chawed up,
In the first round of BLACKIE and JONES.

And drew with his blows as much couleur de rose

If our calendar marked ides and nones !
But, without these large ifºs, mere spouting club tiffs

But as each made a case, where the facts had no place,

He's home! he's home! the Soldier bleeds
From his sarcastic snout.
Ha! well returned, the stream of gore
From FREDERICK's muzzle drips,
That kissing-trap shall never more
Entrap sweet Anna's lips.
Then with twin yell the champions close,
And hit the best they can,
And blackened eyes and flattened nose
Attest the English Man.

And knows not which to choose,

And FREDERICK's iron thews.

He strives to rise ; Brave FREDERICK, no,

And marry me instead.”

And stole bis last new breeches.

A CHIVALRIC BALLAD.
“A LANGPORT ROMANCE.-On Sunday the congregation at Huish Church were
amused by the forbidding of banns of marriage between FRED, BIDDLECOMBE, of
Muchelney, and a girl named ANNE HARRIS, of Huish Episcopi. A dispute had
arisen between the parties in consequence of a soldier having met the couple and
insisted on a prior claim to the girl. A fight ensued, and shortly afterwards HARRIS
decamped with the soldier, taking BIDDLECOMBE's best clothes with her."-Pristol

So spoke young BIDDLECOMBE

His hand in hand of ANNE's,
Her whispered answer ANNIE
gave,
My FRED, put up the
banns."
He published once, he published
twice,
That reverend priest and good,
This Sabbath day to publish
thrice
In holy church he stood.
“If any know a righteous cause
Why these should not be wed,
Cite the divine or human laws
On which they seek to tread."
Young BIDDLECOMBE he smole a smile,
Fair ANNIE blushed a blush,
When up the consecrated aisle
A Soldier rushed a rush.
His face was bronzed by Eastern suns,
He seemed to come from far,
As one who'd charged on Indian guns,
And fought the Russian Czar.
To his broad brow his manly hand
He raised in grave salute.
The plighted pair that Soldier scanned
With gesture stern and mute.
Then turning to the priest he said,
“I do forbid those banns."
The bridegroom's cheeks are fiery red,
And pale are lovely ANNE'S.
“Before I joined the Ranks of Death,
Our foemen to defy,
To me she pledged her troth and faith,
ANNE! answer, if I lie.”
No answer gave the trembling maid,
But glistening tears she shed,
Outspoke the bridegroom, "Who's afraid ?
I'll punch that Soldier's head.”
In vain the frighted Beadle cried
“ This here's no place for jaw,"
The lovers and intending bride
From holy church withdraw.
And e'er the good and reverend man
On knees hath meekly kneeled,
They stand, those twain, and faithless ANNE,
In an adjacent field.
Brave BIDDLECOMBE flings down his coat
His Sunday coat so gay,
The Soldier from his manly throat
Tears his cravat away.
From Huish there hurries many a clown,
They form the fatal ring :
The Soldier fires a furious noun,
Unmeet for bard to sing.
Then stern on guard, like Saxon men,
They both together fell,
If either spoke his rival then
'Twas scarce to wish him well :

HOW TO PLEASE AMERICA.
YE Gentlemen of England who sail upon the seas, give
ear unto the paragraph that follows, if you please :-
"A fund is being raised for the families of the six poor men who
were so unfortunately, swept overboard from the yacht Fleetwing
during her recent match from New York to Cowes."
Of course all British yachtsmen will heartily contribute
to so laudable a fund, and there will be a race between
them, doubtless, to decide who can the most quickly draw
the largest cheque. So all that COMMODORE Punch need
add is, that subscriptions may be paid to the credit of
the “Fleetwing Fund” at the National Bank, Charing
Cross, and that the biggest contributions will be thankfully
received.

THRICE welcome, Thaw, Deliverer, comes,
The greedy cabman scowls and swears,
And thinks upon the awful sums
Extorted from his bullied Fares.
How, in those days when snow was ice,
He waged his war on great and small,
At times exacted ten-fold price,
At times refused to go at all.
Now, blest be Thaw, the snow is mud
Which rains and carts will clear away,
It drips with tears, it falls with thud,
In turn the Public has its day.
When next the greedy Cabman begs
For extra sixpence, answer
“No”-
What joy to knock him off his legs
With “ Please remember New Year's Snowo."

The above joke is SIR WALTER SCOTT's, by the way, and serves Mr.
Punch very well for a heading to half-a-dozen lines which, in departure
from his general custom, he proposes to insert in reference to a contem-
porary. The Examiner newspaper is completing its sixtieth year, and is
gracefully mindful of the fact. Mr. Punch wishes the Examiner many
happy returns of its birthday. That journal has stood manfully by the
famous motto from Defoe, which it has worn on its shield for so many
years. Fearless, witty, and gentlemanly, not given to gushing, but
not ashamed of honest sympathy, scholarly but not pedantic, and
always in tone with the minds of thoughtful and refined readers, the
Examiner is distinguished even among the high class journalism of
London. Mr. Punch, who is also remarkable for all the above good
qualities, and many others, takes off his hat, and gives a cheer for the
birthday of the sparkling sexagenarian.

THE GLADIATORS' MUSTER.
The time's at hand! The fateful nones
Of February near,
And the great city buzzes
In flush of hope or fear :
Nor the great city only,
But England far and nigh,
Wherever rumour reaches,
Or pen-winged ducks can fly;
Ir the shop of the Plebeian,
Where BEALIAL faiths prevail ;
In Patrician triclinia
Where the BRIGHT star is pale ;
Where in pleasant country-houses
Time is killed and hearts are lost;
Where at cover-sides the hunters
Wish good-speed to the frost;
In adyta, whence noodles
Are with flap-doodle fed;
In Oracles, that palter;
In leaders that are led ;
On one chime and one only
The changes still are rung,
One theme sets each pen driving,
Sets wagging every tongue-
That theme is the Arena,
Its matches, chances, names-
England's Ludi Sessionales,
Our Gladiatorial Games!
If thus the crowd is eager,
That will but watch the scene,
Back its chances and its colours,
The blue, or red, or green;
Deal hisses or rain plaudits,
Turn its thumbs either way,
Dooming to death, or sparing
To fight another day,
From the front-rows patrician
Where knights, and vestals sit,
To the top-bench, where flashes
The Proletarian's wit,
On wearers of the purple,
Too dignified to laugh,
Show'ring the Forum's offal,
And the Suburra's chaff-
If these are hot to fever,
What must the fighters feel,
The Gladiators, entered
To test each other's steel?
DERBEIUS, fierce lanista
Of the new TORIAN school,
MERRIPEBBULUS the mighty;
And Humilis the cool;
LUCIDUS RADICALIS,
Born in the sect of peace,
Whose life of bull-dog warfare
Has never known surcease :
WALPOLIUS the weeping;
PAKINGTONIUS the prim,
Hight Naso, from proboscis
O'er-reaching vizor's rim;
CRANBORNIUS ACIDULUS,
Bitter of word and blow;
And STANLIUS DERBEÏDES,
Sedate and strong and slow.
And-mystery of the Arena-
One shape of many names, -
VIVIANUS, CONINGSBÆUS,
SIDONIUS, who claims,
But to ludi and lanista,
As Dizzius far-renowned,
With form not quite an angel's,
And falchion razor-ground:
Fighter 'gainst odds undaunted,
And at all weapons yare,
Secutor's deadly dagger,
Or Laquearius' snare;
As swift as MERRIPEBBULUS
The hampering net to throw,
Nor slower with
the barbèd point
To deal the after-blow-
The peopled Circus knows him,
Will cheer as he comes in,
Yet though so great a fighter
None ever saw him win :
When they shout his final “ habet!”
And he waits the word to die,
Will the thousands in the Circus
Turn thumbs to sand or sky?
But why name—when so many
Un-named must still remain,
Some who have gained their glory,
Some whose glory's still to gain ?
Known and unknown, they're must'ring,
And arming head and heel :
Dizzius grinds his weapon,
While DERBEIUS turns the wheel :
In vain to Stanlius looks he
To lend a filial hand,
Hard son can nought for heady sire
But with crossed arms to stand :
CRANBORNIUS sourly weigheth
The odds 'twixt foes and friends,
When MERRIPEBBULUS attacks,
And Dizzius defends :
Stout Lucidus is plying
His thonged and loaded fists,
And, as he hits a dummy,
Pounding it where he lists;
But he must be more cautious
When he the fight comes to;
The difference none knows better
'Twixt dummy foes and true :
While MILLIUS, the philosopher,
How came he to such craft ?
Taking his heat for earnest,
Proffers a cooling draught:
Here, brisk and biting HUMILIS
With keen eye seeks the joint
Where in LUCIDUS's armour
He best may plant his point:
There-pigmiest of fighters-
But of bigger heart than thews,
RUSSELLIUS strains to compass
Five feet seven in his shoes.
Plying unequal dumb-bells,
The big his youth essayed,
Against the bunch of little ones
That his old age betrayed.
But hark! the trumpet soundeth,
And thousands straining stare;
And PunchIUS the Prætor
Hath ta'en his curule chair.
Now, Gladiators, forward
To win or lose a name.

Et victuri !”—Make your game!

Of desire for Reformation,
Make it by the presentation
Of petitions; and sensation
Rouse by their accumulation.

Of a monstrous aggregation,
Which will cause an obstipation
Of the streets, with depredation,
Harm, and loss by trade's cessation.
If you do, you'll breed vexation,
And engender indignation,
And encounter execration,
For endeavour at dictation,
Bullying, and intimidation.

And pacific operation,

BETWEEN THE LIONS.
THE January sunlight
Was struggling faint and low
With the upward-creeping shadows
That quenched its fitful glow,
When the Lion from the portal
Of the PERCIES gazing down,
Was ware of something stirring
At that end of the town.
Or is that tail averted
From the Art that is, to say
The road to Art that should be,
Lies just the other way?
Or points it towards Temple Bar,
As if John Bull it prayed,
To give Art up altogether,
And go city-wards to trade ?
But of that Lion's action
Be the riddle what it may,
He ne'er looked more astonished
Than when, the other day,
He saw four mighty monsters,
Swathed all in canvass shrouds,
Round Nelson's column planted,
And girt with gaping crowds.
Amazement grew to anger,
When, all four placed, at last,
MANNERS and MAROCHETTI
Bade shrouds aside be cast:
And through the London fog-damps,
A stone's throw from his paw,
Round the base of Nelson's column
FOUR LIONS COUCHED HE SAW !
And, gradual, o'er the rumble
Of traffic far below,
Was shaped to utterance leonine
That sound, sublime and slow,
Through roll of cab and omnibus,
Deep-chested as Big Ben,
Once roared the Percy Lion,
Roared once, and roared again.
Who are ye, huge impostors ?
You the British Lions-fie!
If there's a British Lion,
At Charing Cross, 'tis I?!
Your very number's fatal
To the claim which you would roar,
The British Lion's singular :
He's one, and you are four!
Long, long has he been pointing,
From off his airy stand,
His nose towards St.
James's,
His tail along the Strand;
Long foreigners and natives
Have questioned, but to fail,
The meaning of that muzzle,
And the moral of that tail.
Was that tail stiff with anger,
Was that muzzle curl'd in scorn
Of the usage London's finest site
At John Bull's hands has borne ?
Of our HAVELOCK and our NAPIER
In soot and copper drest?
Of our brace of mounted GEORGES
One rampant, one at rest ?
Or, of WILKINS’ range of punch-bowls,
With
pepper pots en suite ?
Or, of our mast-headed NELSON,
Or the fountains at his feet?
Or at the combination
Of these abortions, planned
To stamp John Bull the biggest muff
That e'er took Art in hand ?
“Are these the little strangers'
We've waited for so long?
Announced when first the man and boy
Were themes of jest and song?
The man has grown a dotard,
The boy a man, and grey;
But still empty staid those bases,
And so, I hoped, would stay.
“And better still left empty,
Than tenanted by you ;
SIR EDWIN had been wiser
To stick the canvass to.
You are big, and you are brazen,
That much must granted be:
But if a British Lion
Is wanted, look at me!
'Tis said, and I believe it,
That at the startling sight,
His tail, unwagged for ages,
Wagged, thrice, fromi left to right:
That from o'er the Percy's portal,
Out of those jaws of stone,
Came, audible to mortal,
A sound 'twixt growl and groan !

On my four legs I stand :

True habitat, the Strand.
The head in air I carry,
The frame and flanks I show,
May not be realistic,
But High Art has made me so.
'But you, what shall I call you?-
Four in one, or one in four !
Mere real Lions, cast in bronze-
Like life, but nothing more!
You look over-fed and sleepy,
On your bellies prone you
With your useless arms before you-
Disposed for fighting shy.
Great works! Yes, you are woppers :
Great, if size be grandeur's crown;
Of worth, if into coppers

Grant yours the image true :
The reality is vanished,
The type should vanish too.
We are the likeness, breathing
With the life that genius gives,
Of the genuine British Lion,
The Lion as he lives.
“ Calm and sedate, and peaceful,
Nay slumb’rous, till the call
Of danger or of duty
Bids the veil of slumber fall.
Let the foe come near my dwelling,
Or assail my brood-no more-
Then ask if I am sleeping,
And for answer take my roar.
“If there be might in movement,
There's might too in repose :
And strength is ten-fold terrible
That waits just cause for blows.
Emblem of such repose and strength
Here, four in one, I lie,
To east and west, to north and south,
Fixing a watchful eye!
“Not roaring for slight reason,
Not stirred by false alarms :
Not blunt, if sheathed, the talons
That point these sinewy arms,
As the true Lion mighty,
But magnanimous in might,
The British Lion fights to live,
Lives to do more than fight.
“But if the occasion cometh,
As come, perchance, it may,
To quicken tusk and talon,
And crush the foe to clay,
Then learn if my old terrors
Are dead, that here you see
A smoothened crest, an armed rest,
A slumberous majesty!”

THE GREAT MEDICINE-MAN.
(4 Nero Canto of Hia-watha.)
Took their scalps, their paint and feathers,
And the moccasins they walked in.
Shall we let them longer wear these ?
Shall we trust their medicine-maker,
The Kau-ka-syun BEN-DEE-ZEE ?
Never! Let us spoil them, strip them
Of the loaves and of the fishes,
Drive them from the pleasant places,
From the hunting-grounds of Of-fis,
From the Bench of Tre-sor-ee-wah,
From the secret Lodge of Dow-nin.”
Then the blowers blew their conch-shells,
DA-LEE-NOO-SAH, the long-winded,
TE-LE-GRA-FAH, the tremendous,
And the Sun, whose beams are bottled,
From the brains of BRIGHT, the Big Tongue,
Blew their conch-shells for the battle.
Round about the Fire of Council,
On the bench of Tre-sor-ee-wah,
In the secret Lodge of Dow-nin,
Sat the chiefs of the Tor-ì-has,
Sat the advisers of LOR-DER-BEE.
The Kau-ka-syun DEE-ZEE, foremost
Of the medicine-men, the Medas,
The Magicians, the Wa-be-nos,
And the Jossa-keeds, the prophets :
Chief of war and braves, JON-À-THAN,
Wrinkled, like an o'er-kept apple,
Juiceless, but the PEEL remaining.
PAH-KIN-TÒ-NOH, guide of war-ships.
Who ne'er sailed the Big Sea-Water;
STAN-LEE, with eyes looking two ways,
One behind him, one before him,
Calm of counsel, cool of judgment,
Still a wonder to his father,
Standing puzzle to LOR-DER-BEE:
And CRAN-BOR-NOH, the sharp-tongued one;
WAL-I-POL, the weeping willow,
Quick to bend, and ever tearful,
With HaH-DEE, surnamed the Gay Thorn,
For his sharpness and good-humour.
Dark and doubtful was their aspect,
Glum and grumpy were their glances,
As they laid their heads together,
Drew around the Fire of Council,
On the bench of Tre-sor-ee-wah,
In the secret Lodge of Dow-nin.
For the braves of the Re-for-mahs,
In their war-paint and their feathers,
With their clubs, from all their lodges,
League on league, were thickly gathered
With the strength of BRIGHT, the Big Tongue,
Bounce of Beales and push of POTT-AH,
Storming round the Lodge of Dow-nin
At the doors of Tre-sor-ee-wah,
Crying “Down with the Tor-i-ahs !
Can they shape the mighty measure,
Weave the charm of the Re-for-mahs,
Fix the wonder-working Fran-chees,
That shall cure the people's ailments,
Give to all what they're in want of,
Wit and wisdom, work and wages,
Short-cut to the Happy Valley,
To the Islands of the Blessed,
To the kingdom of Come-eat-me,
Where the geese fall ready-roasted,
And all good things come for asking ?
JON-À-WO-BUN, he could shape it,
And WILL-YOO-IT, called the Glad Stone;
They had cured the people's
ailments,
Fixed the wonder-working Fran-chees,
In the Wig-wam of West-min-stah,
In the Big Talk of the nation,
For the land of the Yen-gee-zees.
But the braves of the Tor-ì-has
From the Cave the serpents summoned-
The Ken-à-beek, the great BOB-LO,
And the little snake GRO-VÈ-NAH,
Marsh-snake from Australian diggins,
EL-co, painted snake that rattles,
And the Orcadian serpent LA-ING,
Called to aid the Headless HORSMAN,
From their ambush in Adullam,
In the back stung Jon-À-WO-BUN,
Stung WILL-YOO-IT, called the Glad Stone,
Braving wrath of Bright the Big Tongue.
Bounce of BEALES and push of PoT-TAH.
Till they stormed the Lodge of Dow-nin,
Won the Bench of Tre-sor-ee-wah,
Scalped the braves of the Re-for-mahs,
The Tor-i-ha chiefs, in council,
Heard the cries of the Re-for-mahs,
And the blowing of their conch-shells,
And their brows grew dark as thunder,
For their council was divided,
Black on this side, white on that side,
Like the leaves of the red willow
When 'tis tossed by Mud-jee-kee-wis,
By the breathing of the west, winde
Then arose the medicine-maker,
The Kau-ka-syun BEN-DEE-ZBE :
“Wherefore are our hearts divided ?
Wherefore are we twain in council ?
Wherefore clutch we spear and war-club
'Gainst ourselves, and not our foemen ?
Shall we, in the Lodge of Dow-nin,
Cut the throats of one another,
Nor unite to save our bacon,
Save our loaves and save our fishes,
Save our seats in pleasant places,
Save the hunting-grounds of Of-fis ?
Let me go forth on the peace-path,
Let me deal with the Re-for-mahs.
I will make a mighty med'cine,
I will outwit JON-À-WO-BUN
And WILL-YOO-IT, called the Glad Stone;
From the med’cine-bag of Mo-shun
I will draw the yarn of glamour,
Wampum string of Re-so-lu-shun,
So that we shall have the glory,
And that they shall have the labour,
Of the shaping of the measure,
Of the fixing of the Fran-chees,
In the Wig-wam of West-min-stab,
In the Big Talk of the nation
For the land of the Yen-gee-zees,
And yet we shall save our places,
Keep the Bench of Tre-sor-ee-wah,
Keep the secret Lodge of Dow-nin!”
So went forth the med'cine-maker,
The Kau-ka-syun BEN-DEE-ZEE,
To the Wig-wam of West-min-stah,
To the Big Talk of the nation,
With the braves of the Tor-i-ahs,
Ranged in ordered ranks behind him,
One in name, but twain in council.
Fronting them, sat the Re-for-mahs,
In their war-paint and their feathers,
Many tribes and many colours ;
Red-men painted with vermilion,
Followers of Bright, the Big Tongue,
Some in neutral colour-Sha-kees-
Some in blue-and-buff,—Whig-à-mores, -
Of the tribe of JON-À-WO-BUN;
Some who all these colours blended
Red and blue and buff and neutral,
As their hopes or humours prompted,
Or the hunt of loaves and fishes :
Many trusting in WILL-YOO-IT,
More who only said they trusted.
And WILL-YOO-IT, called the Glad Stone,
The Keneu, the Great-war-eagle,
Lean and lowering, in the van-ward,
O'er his hooked
beak scowled scornful,
Knit his iron brows so ruthless,
Lit his keen eyes for the onset,
Set his thin lips hard for battle.
Then out-stepped the med cine maker,
The Kau-ka-syun, BEN-DEE-ZEE,
In the space betwixt the armies,
Of Tor-i-ahs and Re-for-mahs.
Very still and solemn looked het;
Black and bright, and sparsely scattered,
Curled his scalp-locks, cork-screw twisted:
Keen and cold, and like a serpent's.
The great serpent's, the Ken-a-beek's,
Glittered his black eye, sole life spark
Of the dreamy, death-like features.
In his belt he bore no weapon,
Scalping knife, nor axe, nor war-club,
Spear nor arrow, nor yet long-bow,
Nought but medicine bag of Mo-shuns ;
With his right-hand putting forward
The Peace-pipe, and in his left-hand,
Half displayed, hid half behind him,
Wampum-strings of Re-so-lu-shuns
Large and loose, thirteen in number.
Then his med'cine dance he measured,
And his med'cine music chaunted,
Slow, sonorous, high and hollow,
Till you would have said that butter
Would not in his mouth have melted :
While he blew his cloud of vapour,
The Puk-wa-na of the Peace-pipe;
Singing, how the war was ended,
'Twixt Tor-ì-ahs and Re-for-mahs;
How the time was come to bury
The war-hatchet, Par-tee-quest-shun,
To shake hands and blow together
The Puk-wa-na of the Peace-pipe,
In the Wig-wam of West-min-stah
In the Big Talk of the nation.
Calling both sides' braves together
To prepare the magic measure,
Fix
the wonder-working Fran-chees,
The Tor-ì-abs lending ballast,
The Re-for-mahs lending movement.
And that both might scheme and shape it,
Both Tor-ì-ahs and Re-for-mahs,
Proffering medicine of his Mo-shuns,
Wampum string of Re-so-lu-shuns.
Eagerly, with rapt attention,
For awhile the warriors heard him,
Chaunting, heavily and hollow,
Spouting, slowly and sonorous,
Till attention grew to wonder,
Expectation to amazement,
“ What the mischief is he up to?
What the dickens is he after ?
Then came weariness of wonder,
Of bewilderment came boredom,
And they said, " There is no magic
In his med'cine bag of Mo-shuns ;
All is bosh and all is bunkum;
He is but a medicine-maker,
And his medicine is moonshine."

SANGER v. BEALES.
HAVING visited the Agricultural Hall
during both the entertainments given there
last week, we can confidently back MR.
SANGER and his Hippodromatic company
against MESSRS. BEALES and POTTER, and
their stud of Demonstrationists. MR. SAN.
GER's artistes, male and female, know their
business, and his clowns and ring-master
understand what they are talking about.
M. AVICE balances himself gracefully in
mid-air more wonderfully than MR. POTTER
in the periods of an extempore speech; and
though MR. BEALES may be great in jumping
over facts and through figures, we prefer
the jumping of MR. SANGER'S Voltigeurs
and MADEMOISELLE GAERTNER'S daring
bounding act through balloons and over gar-
ters; and then, what is the cloudy vagueness
of platform oratory to the graceful sweep of
MADEMOISELLE ETHAIR's veil, as she floats
along, the bewitching sylph of the arena ?
Lastly, MR. SANGER welcomes us to a con-
gress of all the European monarchs (from
KING JOHN CHINAMAN, on his dragon, to
QUEEN VICTORIA, on her magnificent car of
triumph), including not only France and
Prussia and Russia and Spain and Italy,
but the Pope, drawn by donkeys, and the
last unannexed Mabarajah on his elephant.

THE RIGHTS OF REFORM.
BOB Lowe, thou dearest friend of Bright's,
In politics have no men rights ?
Then A bas no more right than B,
Which latter bath as much as he.
How much? The right of doing nought ?
Nay, but of doing what he ought.
So rights and duties are the same,
And every man the right can claim
Of doing that for wbich he's fit,
If he do right in doing it;
The right in making laws to bear,
In due proportion, such a share
That neither Capital, nor Labour,
Nor Land shall overrule its neighbour.
Read the Reform Bill now that places
Reform exactly on this basis :
But, on a broader or a straiter,
Read that which puts it six months later.

OLD QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
Why does a miller wear a white hat ? Not always to
keep his head warm. In hot weather he wears it to keep
his head cool. A miller wears a white hat because he can-
not help it; or because it pleases him.
A herring and a half for three-halfpence, how many
herrings for threepence ? Not necessarily three. The
values of the halves of a herring may be unequal. One
selling at a halfpenny, the other may sell at a penny or a
farthing. Besides, one whole herring would probably fetch
more than the sum of the prices of its two halves sold
separately.
Who was the father of ZEBEDEE's children? For aught
we know, MRS. ZEBEDEE's first husband.
Where was Moses when he put the candle out? In
the daylight very likely. Perhaps he had lighted the candle
to seal a letter.

Though Tory and Liberal dames sat as tight
As berrings, the press they'd abide;
We'd settle our boundary questions all right,
And they 'neath reefed crinolines ride.
With a row of sweet faces, and bright eyes, or soft,
Our gallery why mayn't we pack,
While the sweet little cherubs may sit up aloft,
To keep watch o'er the life of poor Jack?
Who's "poor Jack," to have cherubs thrown in with his pay!
And his chances prize-money to touch,
While our cherubs still are poked out of the way,
Like odalisques housed in a hutch !
Can it be, as 'tis whispered, your married M.P.,
Who don't like the ladies to show,
Lest too close the watch of wives' lorgnettes might be
Of Hub's post on the benches below?
For like other Clubs, the House serves, but too oft,
As excuse for liege Lords, who've grown slack,
To leave wives, not like cherubs, to sit up aloft,
And sulk till stray sposos come back.
To MANNERS I said, when I saw he fought shy
Of BERNAL's warm petticoat plea-
“ The state of a House that's not under the eye
Of a woman a bad state must be.
For ever since Eve upon Adam began,
'Tis the influence of woman that rules,
For woman makes manners, and manners make man,
And her smiles are the pleasantest schools.
Then why ber sweet sway should our House only lack
To make the rude tame, the hard soft ?
We've as much right to our ducks, to perch up aloft,
As to his little cherubs poor Jack.'
I admit your M.P. should be fint at a pinch,
That he always should answer the whip;
Nor from all the bright eyes in Belgravia should flinch,
If they wooed him in voting to trip.
But witch’ry's most witching from under a veil,
Half-hid beauty's more fatal than bare,
And perhaps, while the ladies are parted per pale,
One may fancy more charms than are there;
Then M.P.'s, let's he men, masks and muzzles have doffºd,
Bid all grilles and gratings go pack,
And let's seat the sweet cherubs in sight up aloft,
To rain smiles- from the SPEAKER'S chair-back!

• OLD KING COLE."
OLD King Cole was a stirring soul,
And a stirring soul was he:
He told the public to put in their pipe
And smoke what he willed to be-
He pooh-poobed the Privy Council,
Laughed Royal Commissions to scorn,
And the more they tried to put him down,
The higher waxed his horn!
Old King Cole took tax and toll
Of the grants for Science and Art:
Bring schools on their knees, for alms or fees,
But give him the lion's part.
Wbate'er lacked oil, the Boilers must boil,
South Kensington wax fat
On purchase and loan, though a bare-picked bone
Be flung to all but that.
Old King Cole never scratched his poll,
But out of it flew a scheme-
Now a Central Hall, with a beavy call,
And an estimate like a dream :
Now a picture-show to draw high and low,
Now a horticultural féte,
With the Princes to walk, and the Nobs to talk,
And the Queen to inaugurate.
Old King Cole could bore like the mole,
Or like the eagle fly :
There was nothing too heavy and nothing too hot,
For old King Cole to try-
From coaxing the ROTHSCHILDS their treasures to lend,
Without a penny of pay,
To getting her Gracious Majesty
To his Mumbo-Jumbo play!
But at last King Cole with wrath the Roll)
Of the Commons has dared to fill,
When for the great First of April show
He sent in his little Bill.
A hundred and sixteen thousand pounds,
And as much more falling due !
No wonder the House of Commons looked black,
And the Treasury looked blue.
But old King Cole, with Stoic soul,
Explanation vouchsafed none,
Of where the money had come from,
Or whither it had gone.
And to reason from things that we have seen
To things that we shall see,
His purse John BULL will have out to pull,
And King Cole still King will be !

ED
AN OUTRAGE ON AN ISM.
We are never tired of hearing it repeated that the
French mind is pre-eminently logical. JOHN BULL cannot
be too often admonished of its vast superiority in point of
logic to his own. Every opportunity ought to be taken
of beating that truth into his head. Let him, then, know
that, at Paris, according to a contemporary's own corre-
spondent :-
“ The manager, oditor, and printer of the journal the Libre Pensée,
have boon subjected to a criminal prosecution for a series of articles
which appeared in that Paper on the 20th and 25th of January and
the 5th of February, on subjects of controversial theology. In
one of these the author attacks Catholicism, which he declares to
be 'a rotten trunk, a receptacle of death whose fatal emanations
spread all around desolation and solitude.' The manager of the paper
has been sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and the editor
to four months, and to pay each a fine of 300 fr., together with the
expenses of the proceedings."
Is it not obvious that Catholicism is not a rotten
trunk, and a receptacle of death whose fatal emanations
spread all around desolation and solitude ? Is it not
manifest that the faith of three hundred millions of man-
kind, mostly civilised, cannot be either the decayed body
of a tree, or an overcrowded cemetery; or that, even if it
can be one or the other of these things, it cannot be both
of them ? "No," answer a French Government, a French
judge, and a French jury. It is not obvious.' It is not
manifest. There is too much verisimilitude in that de-
scription of Catholicism. There are too many people who
are likely to believe a good deal of it, if not all. The
truth, moreover, is that, if any argument about it were
permitted, too much of it could be apparently proved. Let
us not, therefore, contemptuously leave it to meet with a
refutation which it will not receive. Our wisest plan is to
silence its promulgators. Accordingly we will sentence
the manager and editor of the Libre Pensée to fine and
imprisonment." This is logic.
Here, in England, Papists and Protestants are free to
abuse each other's respective isms as much as they please,
so long as they refrain from libelling one another or any
one else. Joun Bull cannot see who is wronged by the
abuse of an ism. Of course that blindness is owing to

TEN minutes-one sixth of an hour-
To settle the “Yes” or the "No,"
Whereon hangs the balance of power
Of classes high, middle, and low.
The time could not well have been shorter,
Though the old one, not RUPERT, had driven-
But e'en RUPERT's self, sure, a quarter,
Or, perhaps, half an hour might have given !
Ten minutes—to say what the bid
At St. Stephen's Dutch auction should be:
Whether BENJAMIN's mess should be hid,
And a way found therefrom to get free;
To decide between braving the rough rage
Of POTTER, BEALES, BRADLAUGH, & Co.,
And risking whole-hog household suffrage-
Though as JONAH our JONATHAN go.
Ten minutes—to fix on the fiat
That may mould generations unborn:
Whether new men and measures to shy at,
Or stick to old ruts, safely worn;
Ten minutes—to make up the mind,
Yes-or no-to a leap in the dark,
With the pluck of blind leaders of blind,
And the lightness of lads on a lark!
Ten minutes-to forfeit our pledges,
Our principles overboard pitch,
Count odds, balance books, settle hedges,
And put a good face on the hitch.
Ten minutes—to eat our own words,
And bid up to BEALES, over BRIGHT;
To harden our hearts for Lowe's girds,
The General's scorn, CRANBORNE's spite !
Ten minutes—to choose 'twixt all this,
And quietly backing the coach,
And, though Bright's alliance we miss,
Escaping the Carlton's reproach,
Tearing Dizzy's wild projects to bits,
Last
year's bills taking down from their shelves;
Spreading stucco o'er Cabinet splits,
And keeping our rows to ourselves !
Ten minutes !-No wonder the plunge
Seemed too much like a jump in mid-air,
That e'en RUPERT threw up the sponge,
And his JONAHs determined to spare.
Ten minutes ! With RUPERT for guide,
And on either side motives so strong-
No wonder, howe'er you decide,
Your decision should prove to be wrong!

It is a gross insult to the
community at large to call a prison-van

able for all of HER MAJESTY's subjects, but only for some. Therefore,
let it henceforth be named the “Queen's quibusdam.”

What bitter, wintry weather !
Confound it altogether!
The tiles are dight
With snow more white

About the streets 'tis lying,
And round your ears are flying
Conglomerate cakes
Of kneaded flakes;
The boys are snowballs shying:
Protect your panes with shutters !
Youth slides along the gutters.

And on your threshold futters.
The birds have all stopped singing,
The crops have left off springing,
There ne'er was seen

So biting, piercing, stinging.

To perish, sun-forsaken ;
The violets blue,
Though that's their hue,
For snow-drops may be taken.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Strength, nursed on long avoidance of extremes,
Knit by the ties that run 'twixt class and class;
That no more shares in democratic dreams
Than oligarchic horror of the mass.
Strength, that has root in reverence for right,
That, by law shaped, has gone on shaping law,
Strength, that will never perish while our light
From principle and precedent we draw!
WHAT THE LIONS THOUGHT OF IT.
'Tis a wild night: in flaws the east winds blow:
Slant drives the sleet, that neither melts to rain,
Nor keeps up its pretension to be snow-
Mad March has brought mid-winter back again.
How comes a crowd gathered on such a night,
About the Lions couched at Nelson's feet !
On what do those red naptha-lamps throw light ?
Wherefore those loiterers, cumbering the street ?
This little man, that perks himself to roar
Between the Lions, strong and dark and dumb,
These listeners, many curious, careless more,
And it were hard to doubt it-earnest some ?
These roughs who through the crowd their calling ply,
Bonnet, pick
pockets, or put on the hug,"
And, blessing Beales and BRADLAUGH, qualify
For the Roughs' University-THE JUG?
At length a stray policeman I impawn,
From rougbs afar, on the mob's outmost bound,
And learn that 'tis Reform the crowd bas drawn,
The League, that lamps and orators has found.
So having in my pockets nought to pick,
old hone,
I force a passage where the crowd is thick,
To hear the blast by Beales his trumpet blown.
But empty breath to empty air is given;
Vox et præterea nihil! All I hear
Is sound and fury without meaning driven
By the east wind, down their kind throats that cheer.
So, as from Beales's blast I gather nought,
I work myself free of the crowd again,
And, musing, try to shape the Lions' thought,
About the crowd, the occasion, and the men.
They think, I think, that neither here nor there,
About their feet, or round the SPEAKER's state,
Is met the Parliament, that mirrors fair
The strength that makes the British Lion great.
Here, in the BEALES and BRADLAUGH Parliament
Is too much bark for the wish or power to bite :
Mountains to heave, in desperate intent,
And, for the heaving, here and there a mite.
Wind-swollen puffiness for solid strength,
The braggadocio of cbiefs, whose brass
Wire-drawn or beaten out to utmost length,
Only with idiots for gold will pass.
There, Potterers, as there are Potters here
Both impotent to shape the nation's clay;
Cowards, who make great questions small, for fear :
Jugglers, who for their tops with pledges play.
Spinners of cobwebs, when we cables need :
Half-adepts, who a spirit can invoke,
In hopes to lame or lay him, at their need,
But impotent his summoned strength to yoke.
And baser tricksters, hiding on their hands
The soil of dirty bribe, or dirtier gain;
And many-acred, small-brained lords of lands,
And hungry dogs, of office-offal fain.
In neither Parliament the strength resides
That of our England makes us emblems fit:
The strength that sways the trident of the tides,
So wide, the sun sees not the bound of it.
WANTED A LITTLE MORE OF THE TORNADO.
THE House of Commons can find time for two or three hour dis-
cussions of Mr. CHURCH WARD's scandal, or MR. LEATHAM'S “ Apologia
pro corruptione suá," or Sir John PAKINGTON's defence of his promo-
tion of LORD HARDWICKE's son over three-fourths of the lieutenants
of higher standing in the Service-in short, for any pretty little quarrel
that involves spicy personalities, and leaves a stain on somebody's
fame or fingers. Can't it spare a night for a case which involves the
rights of half-a-hundred Englishmen? Can't it muster up virtuous
indignation enough-enough of the spirit that blazed into flame over
CAPTAIN JENKINS's ear, some hundred and thirty years ago-to bring
home to the insolent and overbearing " Jack Spaniard” that England,
though in no way disposed to pick quarrels with foreigners, or to bully
on slight provocation, is not content to put up, quite as quietly as
LORD STANLEY seems disposed to do, with the seven months' illegal
imprisonment, plunder, and ill-treatment of the officers and crew of the
Tornado?
It is true that forty-five of the fifty-three sufferers from this out-
rageous violation of international law and natural justice have been
liberated, but eight still remain in captivity, and even the forty-five
so tardily set free bave been ordered by the Foreign Office to be sent
home “
as distressed British seamen," and with express directions
given to our Minister at Madrid not to insist at present on any indem-
nification for their long suffering, not even for restoration of the money
-some £1093-of which they were robbed at the time of their illegal
capture on the bigh seas! And this, after LORD STANLEY has ex.
pressly stated in his despatch of March 12) that the intervention of
our Government has been exclusively founded on the injustice and
illegality of the proceedings adopted by the Spanish authorities in the
prosecution of their claim against
“the vessel.”
Unless indeed, LORD STANLEY have merely deferred the claims of
these ill-used men for indemnification nor that he may exact it, with
interest, hereafter. If that be so, it is England's duty to strengthen
his hands. If it be not so, and LORD STANLEY be inclined to let the
men whistle for the compensation most righteously their due, it is
doubly England's duty to speak out, through her Press and her
Parliament, and let both Stanley and Spaniard know that such crying
and scandalous injustice must not, and shall not, be.
“ CHAMPAGNE CHARLEY.”
It is with a gentleman's reluctance that Mr. Punch has brought him-
self to print the above vulgarity.. But he heeds po sacrifice of feeling
when he can instruct. He bas just lighted upon an amusing passage
in tbat most entertaining book, MR. JESSE's Memoirs of George the
Third, and it is a triumph of art to be able to append a morsel of read-
able stuff on such a peg or such a name for a time :-
“Exactly a hundred years ago CHARLEZ TÓWNSHEND delivered one of the most
brilliant speeches ever heard in the Commons. He bad previously spoken with
calmness and judgment, then went to dinner with two friends, and re-appeared in
the House about eight, balf drunk with champagne, and more intoxicated with
spirits. But whatever may bave been the source of bis inspiration, there flowed
from his lips auch bursts of impassioved eloquenco, such flashes of wit, such bitter-
ness of invective, so varied a torrent of mingled ribaldry and learning, of happiness
of allusion, imagery, and quotation, that everybody was enchanted. For some days,
says WALPOLE, the universal question was, Did you hear CHARLES'S champagne
speech ?'"
Now, if TOWNSHEND had been called Champagne CHARLEY, the
words, instead of being intolerable (luckily the cleverest of the bur-
lesque writers, and a respected contributor to Mr. Punch, has wittified
the tune) would bave been worth remembering. As it is, they inspire
Mr. Punch with a desire to kick the person who uses them. When
shall we escape the Cad-lyrics of the music-balls ?
That strength lies in the calm and common sense
That, drawn from deep reserves, can turn to scorn
St. Stephen's pride and peddling impotence,
And bring low BEALES' and BRADLAUGH's brazen horn.
Strength which can smite offence, occasion shape,
As lions make Earth's weaker herds their own:
Clear off the sophist films white truth that drape,
As lions' tongues the membrane rasp from bone.
A Centenarian in a Cage.
THE Dispatch states that the sister of BÉRANGER is still living, at
Paris, in good health, 101 years of age, in the Couvent des Oiseaux.

A STRIKE OF SMOCK FROCKS.
(MR. HAWCOCK sings.)
'Tis strikun for wages as now's all the rage
In this here progressive enlightenment age;
All labour 's a risun, and prices is too :
And I doan't know what we be goun to do.
The weavers was always a strikun, and then
The miners, they struck, and the ironworks men.
The builders is often on strike for a rise;
And even the tailors strikes sometimes, likewise.
Of strikes on the railways intended you hears,
The cry is Strike Stokers,'and Strike Engineers !
Which must, sitch small profits the Companies shares,
Make them strike as well by an increase of fares.
The shipwrights have struck for additional pay,
Can't live on six shilluns and sixpunce a day;
Whilst here there is fellers, that bain't fur to seek,
Contrives for to do't on nine shilluns a week.
When I, as a youth, did a clodhuppun roam,
I oft heer'd the bumpkins zing “Britons Strike Home,”
But there was no strikun in them days as now:
They only struck hosses that foller'd the plough.
Now they've took at last too to strikun, I hear ;
The lab'rers at Gawcott in Buckinghamshire.
Ten shilluns a-week's all they arned heretofore,
But now they have struck to get two shillun more.
Trades Unions for workmen arranges a strike.
Farm lab'rers have now begun doun the like.
They 've got their Committee and Treasurer too,
Likewise Secretairy to carry 'em droo..
That systum of strikun, by all I can find,
Will soon be tried here if we farmers doan't mind;
And if the men strikes that's employed on the land,
I s'pose their employers must grant their demand.
Consider'n to how much provisions do come,
Ten shilluns a week, I must own, 's a small sum.
And if there's a strike as is anyways fair,
'Tis sitch as the strike up nigh Buckingham there.
But if we complies, for to gie 'um content,
We also med strike for reduction of rent,
But can't strike and pay at the same time, wuss luck!
While others can strike, we can only be struck.
Of all this here strikun the end I doan't zee,
Nor who, arter all, is the suff'rers to be.
But this I'll acknowledge, there's nobody can
Have moor cause to strike nor a farm lab’run man.

the Mutiny Bill had been carried, it would have put an end
to corporal punishment in the Army during the time of
peace. What then ?
Jobbernowl. Sir, if logging in the Army were abolished,
the Army would be demoralised, and, go to the deuce.
Can't do without it, Sir. Civilians may talk; but we can't
do without it, Sir-can't do without it.
Jones. As a civilian, of course, I speak with due diffi.
dence. But is the British Soldier, generally, a fellow that
can be restrained only by fear of the lash ?
Job. Can't do without it, Sir-can't do without it.
Jones. But, 'my dear General, fear—the fear of bodily
pain—is that the sort of feeling to restrain a man whose
business consists in exposing his flesh to be lacerated and
his bones to be shattered ?

Jones. Well, I don't know, but I should have thought
that? a man who could only be got to behave himself by
the terror of the cat, must, be a good-for-nothing fellow.
Job. Can't do without it.
Jones. Can't you do without such fellows ? Hadn't you
better get rid of them? Are there so many scoundrels in
the rank and file of the British Army, that the cat is neces-
sary to keep the Army together ?
Job. Can't do without it, Sir.
Jones. Well, but then, if that is so, the British Army is
worse than the British Rascalry, the British Felonry, the
British Rogues and Thieves. Among convicts the cat-
o’-nine-tails is reserved for the exceptional punishment of
cruel and cowardly garotters.
Job. Can't do without it, Sir, for all that. Discipline,
Sir, discipline must be maintained. Can't do without it.
Jones. Well
, it certainly does seem odd to me. Flogging
is held to be too bad for any but the worst of criminals,
and yet you can't do without it in the honourable pro-
fession of arms.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Charles H. Bennett.
KATE TERRY, though she cannot, short as her experience of the stage
has been, reasonably be expected to equal her, she will have achieved
something over which all the lovers of the higher dramatic art may
and will, rejoice. There is room in this field for her and many more.
That the promise of this interesting young lady's face, voice, and
name, may be fulfilled to the uttermost, is Mr. Punch's hope and
prayer. Buffoon as the superficial public may think him, he loves
and feels high art, and he is not the first low comedian who like BEN
Jonson's Master Matther, has kept in his closet "a stool to be melan-
choly upon.”
APRIL 2, 1867.
A VERY able colleague, a very dear friend, has been
removed, at an early age, from among us. To his genius
it is not here that tribute should be paid, but it may be
said that none of our fellow-workers ever entered more
heartily into his work, or laboured with more earnestness
to promote our general purpose. His facile execution, and
singular subtlety of fancy were, we hoped, destined to
enrich these pages for many a year. It has been willed
otherwise, and we lament the loss of a comrade of invalu-
able skill, and the death of one of the kindliest and gentlest
of our associates, the power of whose hand was equalled
by the goodness of his heart.
SIDDONS TO THE RESCUE.
A GREAT name is a perilous possession; and the name of SIDDONS
is the most burdensome that a lady-aspirant to stage-honours can have
to stand up under.
The young Lady who bears this mighty name in the third genera-
tion, and who has been acting for a year past in the provinces, has now
challenged the verdict of London. It is to be regretted that she should
have done so, from the reading desk in the first instance, instead of
from the boards. The more genuine her vocation as an actress the
worse, in all probability, her chances of succeeding as a reader at
this point of her experience.
An old actress may have so tamed her histrionic fire, and have so
learnt the limits which divide elocution from impersonation, that she
may be able to turn stage experience to account in reading. MRS.
SIDDONS did so in her old age. Her distinguished niece, MRS. FANNY
KEMBLE, has done so in middle life. We have seen a similar power
more recently manifested by Miss HELEN Faucer and Miss GLYNN.
But MRS. SCOTT-SIDDONS is still on the threshold of her womanhood
and her Art Her instincts and impulses as an actress can, at present,
only serve to hamper instead of helping her as a reader.
We are glad to see that she is at once to have the opportunity of
showing how she can bear the burden of her name, as an actress, and
we shall watch the event with interest.
Some good points about her eye and ear give warrant that she
carries the credentials of her illustrious descent in her face. Take ten
years from the lineaments of Sir Joshua's Tragic Muse, and
MRS. SCOTT-SIDDONS might, almost, have sat for those lambent eyes,
and grandly-chiselled features.
True, the great grand-daughter is small of stature and slight of
proportions, while her great ancestress was stately of height and
largely moulded-a muse in figure as in face. In the descendant, for
the present at least, we see no possibility of a Constance, or a Lady
Macbeth ; but by way of compensation, she has all that is needed, in
voice and person, for a Juliet, Rosalind, or Imogen. The voice is at
once sweet and sonorous. It has the unmistakable ring of education
and good-breeding. What powers of humour, pathos, or tragic
intensity, may lie behind those beautiful features, or find breath through
this musical organ, London has yet to learn. On these points we
should not trust any opinion formed on her reading only, for reasons
already indicated. If there were errors of emphasis enough to indicate
that the inexperience of twenty had not been corrected by deeper or
maturer counsel, these would be quite immaterial, if the test of the
stage reveal the power to conceive and sustain a character as a whole,
and to interpret it with grace, refinement, and right apprehension of
its humour or its passion. At present, we have one young actress,
and one only, who has shown this power in a consummate degree,
and who only waits the opportunity of a fitting stage to show that the
loveliest womanly creations of the ideal drama have still among us an
admirable impersonator, who is fitted for the task, at once by grace of
person, and refinement of mind and manners, by natural intelligence and
laboriously acquired mastery of her art. That actress is Miss KATE
TERRY, who is egregiously misjudged as an artist, if tested only by
even her best performances in realistic drama, and who, in her Ophelia
and Viola has, as yet, had but infrequent and unfavourable oppor-
tunities for revealing her noblest and purest metal. If Mrs. SCOTT-
SIDDONS should develope qualities at all approaching those of Miss
SHALL WE RUB “NO POPERY!” OFF THE
DOOR?
(See the debates on the Bill to repeal the Ecclesiastical Titles Act.)
Who fears to speak of fifty-one,
And anti-Papal panic,
When John BULL swore no Bull should roar
Loose here, save Balls Britannic:
When Papist mitres he cried down
As Papist levers' handles ;
Swearing their wearers to discrown,
And quench their Roman Candles ?
When LITTLE JOHN a-tiptoe sprung,
And penned “the Durham letter,
Defiance at Rome's lightning flung,
Her faggot and her fetter,
Some said that faggot was burnt out,
That fetter long rust-rotten:
But there was meaning in that shout,
Of instincts true begotten.
When on the letter came the Bill,
Of penalties and pains,
For all that Romish titles still
Dared sport in John's domains :
When giving rope to Priest and Pope,
Those who the Bill dared bring out,
With threats content, to clamour bent
And coolly took its sting out.
When Punch showed Act and Actor up
And little Johnny chiselled,-
As boy who chalked “ No Popery
On WISEMAN's door, and mizzled !
Since then, up-hung, the Act has swung
The deadest of dead letters :
But footpads may a warning read
E'en from a corpse in fetters.
And, by his hunch, now will not Punch,
Though the law's dogs be dumb ’uns,
Eat humble pie, peccani cry,
At Pope's or Prelate's summons.
The Act was good, for all no blood
Its bite has ever followed.
It spoke a truth, that still is sooth,
And must by Popes be swallowed.
That England's Church owns England's law,
Knows no head but the QUEEN,
But from the State draws power and weight,
And on the State must lean.
That here Rome's mitres are fools' caps,
Rome's hierarchy naught:
And Romish Sees but the mirage
By thirst of priestcraft wrought.
As boys they press, who've made a mess,
Into the humbling office
Of wiping clean what fouled has been,
While loud their comrades' scoff is-
Some wish LORD JOHN were called upon
The vain words to out-score,
And write “By Licence of the Law"
On the Archbishop's door!
But Punch says "No!”-Be this not so :
Still let those words remain :
Rather, that all may read who go,
Write them up o'er again.
Dogs, in their sleep, their grinders keep,
Though the lips are closed o'er 'em :
And a rod is not less a rod,
That's hung up in terrorem.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
JACK SPANIARD AT THE TRIANGLES.

-
LORD STANLEY has spoken out at last-not before it
was wanted, and redress for the outrages on the crew of
the Tornado, and on the owners as well as crew of the
Victoria, has been demanded, in terms which leave nothing
behind them but an ultimatum and reprisals.
When the Don has done us this satisfaction-and he will
have to do it, in spite of his bluster and braggadocio, for
there is nothing under the sun like Spanish brag-we shall
have to face the further question of the wrong done to the
owners of the Tornado. LORD STANLEY has given them
the cold shoulder from the first, having, apparently been
prejudiced against their claim by the daring allegations of
the Spanish Government—allegations, we are bound to
say, contradicted by the ship's papers, and by, every
particle of trustworthy evidence extant in the published
correspondence.
This point has yet to be cleared up, and LORD STANLEY
is bound to satisfy himself and the country about it. But
whatever conclusion may be borne out in this particular,
as to which we must confess our own impression to be
that the owners of the Tornado have been as cruelly
wronged as the crew, John Bull must not allow his
Tornado to be put down, now that it has once been raised.
We cannot measure Spain's liability to compensate our
injured sailors and shipowners, by her poverty, her weak-
ness, or her dishonesty, any more than by her conceit and
her blustering.
She has shown herself in this case, what she has always
been in all her international relations, a brazen braggart,
and a measureless liar. This is hard truth, but Punch is
not a 'diplomatist, and need not mince matters. We have
now to teach her that the liberties and property of English-
men cannot be invaded and confiscated without a penalty,
and that England has made up her mind to insist on that
penalty being exacted to the uttermost farthing.

FRENCH BEEFEATERS AND ENGLISH BEEF.
ENGLISHMEN in days gone by were wont to sneer at their French
neighbours because they drank sour wine and ate fricassées of frogs.
But French dishes and French drinks are common now in England,
and there seems reason to believe that English beef and beer will soon
be popular in France. See for instance what a writer in the Morning
Post says about the way in which our two refreshment places at the
Paris Exhibition are winning converts to our tastes :-
“ Pale ale is in great demand at these two establishments, and is highly appre-
ciated, not only by Englishmen but by crowds of foreigners, who loudly praise it.
Here also are to be seen splendid rounds and ribs of beef, which are cooked
in England, and sent over by the night mail, so that they arrive perfectly fresh in
the morning ready for luncheon."

will be changed. His revolutions will subside into reform demonstra-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOAT RACE.
A DULL dead sky distilling rain,
A sun reserved and prudish,
And vicious gusts whose hints were plain
That Boreas was rudish;
Rain wed to mud in every place
(A dirty kind of leaven);
Such hopeful case showed in the race
Of eighteen sixty-seven.
The English public thronged the paths
In endless helpless muddle :
The English publie took foot-baths
In many an obvious puddle.
(Benighted aliens might refuse
To recognise the good in't;
And rather choose to keep dry shoes
The English public wouldn't.)
Maidens were present, high-born dames,
In phaëton, coach, and brougham,
And other vehicles whose names
I'll mention when I know 'em.
And fair-haired girls on horseback there,
So soaked, and oh, so pretty!
With nought to wear except the bare
Blank macintosh of pity.
Blue, dark or light, on each man's tie,
Blue on each lady's bonnet;
Blue everywhere, except the sky
With leaden grey upon it.
Blue on the harness horses shook,
The oars of every sculler-
Blue in his look, who'd made a book,
And backed the Cambridge colour.
For vainly GRIFFITHS spurted strong,
And showed his pluck and musele,
As side by side they raced along
In that unequalled tussle.
The grand slow stroke they never shift,
The heir-loom of the Isis ;
The boat's long, “lift," that fatal gift,
Saved Oxford at the crisis.
And Bowman struggled all he knew,
And didn't shame his nomen ;
But showed himself superior to
The usual run of bow-men.
And CROWDER crowded might and mass,
And CARTER proved no ninny;
And Tinne's brass--but let that pass,
We won't make puns on TINNÉ.
And MARSDEN managed well the crew
That put their trust his skill in ;
And WILLAN proved a good and true
As well as "heavy willa(i)n.”
They owe him much, but all the same
As great to Wood their debt is,
Since Wood by name, must be a flame
Of sylva-footed Thetis,
And Fish of course propelled the bark
As swimmingly as could be ;
And Torrenvan's steering (vain remark !)
Was all that steering should be.
And choice of place, seven times the case,
And luck, and "lift," and leaven,
And pluck, and pace, pulled off the race,
Of eighteen sixty-seven.
Yet fight brave Cantabs one and all,
Nor let the light blue ribbons
Distinguish a "decline and fall”
Perhaps as great as GIBBON'S.
Hope, work, and wait, 'twon't be too late,
When once again you've striven,
If sixty-eight reverse the fate
Of eighteen sixty-seven.

Poor earthen flagons small,
Dashed on each other, kind to kind,

Lo, Emperor and Minister,
Crowned craft, and craft sans crown,
Gamesters as desperate as e'er
On the green cloth staked down.
He who 'gainst Rouge for Noir went in,
An Empire's throne to gain :
He who thrones for his Lord could win,
Content to rule, not reign.
A well-matched pair, calm, crafty, cool,
Stern wills and smooth regards;
The fate of Europe in the pool,
Dynasties on the cards !
QUOS DEUS VULT PERDERE.
Whom God to ruin dooms for sin,
Their wits he first withdraws !
Lo, France and Prussia brought within
That awfullest of laws !
The powers that boasted, late, how each
For an idea warred,
Draw off their velvet gloves, to reach
Their swords, and spring on guard.
'Tis an idea, too, that now
Bids troops take place of talk-
That either should to the other bow,
As cock of Europe's walk.
It is an idée fixe of France,
Or his who is her fate,
That France grows less by each advance
That Prussia leaves more great.
Whereas 'tis Prussia's Grund-idee,
That strong enough she's grown
To slap France on the face to-day,
Yet hold more than her own.
What wonder if, set side by side,
These two ideas clash,
And Janus' gates, which war sets wide,
Fly open with a crash!
So Time's wheel brings round destined ends :
So to the poisoner's lip
The poisoned chalice Heaven commends,
His own drugged draught to sip.
Strong hand against strong hand arrayed
Must weaklings' wrongs repay ;
The mights that owned no right are made
To waste themselves in fray:
A match in which who wins shall stand,
Or seem to stand, supreme;
In which who loses, from his hand
Sees power fade like a dream.
And they who all laws have defied,
Except the law of might,
Mights, long unholily allied,
Åre met to test in fight.
While at their side unseen doth pass,
Nemesis with her glaive,
To give the loser's coup de grâce,
And dig the winner's grave.
As these arm each for th other's end,
So him that gains the day
Sure Retribution will attend,
To claim him for her prey.

Have learnt how to behave:

Their very undertakers
No coffins will supply!
And we're all striking, strike, strike, striking,

Political Economy,
You tell us, we've defied :

In church or shop can teach :
While we know what masters practise,
We don't care what they preach-
So we're all striking, strike, strike, striking,

What wonder while rich Capital
To number one is true,
Poor Labour should the interest
Of number one pursue ?
But while, in clash of capitals,
No master master spares,
Our number one I take it
Is a bigger one than theirs.
Though we're all striking, strike, strike, striking,
Though we're all striking in our shops at home.

Each man for his own hand :
We fight, in our trades-unions,
Each man for the whole band.

'Tis the weakling's case we heed,
While we're all striking, strike, strike, striking,
We're all striking in our shops at home.
We don't deny that Capital
Might yet be Labour's friend :
And when the two are friendly,
Why then-their feud will end.
But while master thinks for master,
And never thinks for man,
Man to man will hold the faster,
And wring out all he can.

He plays unmolested the frisettes amid,
Scarce, save by a microscope, seen:
There be gambols at will, being easily hid,
Like the fays on the moonlit green!

He crosseth the ocean, this roamer gay,
Of a daiuty dwelling in quest;
And on many a head will be couch on his way,
Ere he fiudeth a quiet nest.

In a foul-smelling Russian back-slum :

With hosts of his relatives come!

But, tho' lowly bis birth, a free entrance he gains

On the Queen of the Fashion, in Mayfair who reigns,
He dwells, where no foe need he fear.

TRUTH AT THE ACADEMY DINNER.
UDE people attack the Academy Dinner-declare it is a wrong
expenditure of the Academy funds, a tribute to flunkeyism,
and an occasion for snobbishness, an example of the worst
features of public dinnerism, in a case where those features
should find no countenance, with the Arts for hosts, and the
Eminences and Celebrities for guests.
But the fact is, the thing is misunderstood, owing to a
shameful mystification preached by the press. Reporters are not
now admitted. In order to conceal their humiliation at the
exclusion, the morning papers have connived at the publication
of a mock report of the speeches at the dinner, founded on
the sort of thing that used to be said there; but is now, happily,
and thanks to the influences which have brought about both
Parliamentary and Academic Reform, out of date.
The fact is, that dry fact and candid experience are now the
standing dishes of the Academic dessert; that the toasts of the
day are drunk, not in more or less questionable vintages, but in
the tonic waters from the well of truth, decanters of which, with
“ bitter cups" for quaffing it from, are placed on the tables as
soon as the cloth is removed, and the Academicians and their
guests are left to their own reflections in the Academic
mahogany, which is polished, for these occasions, as bright as
a mirror, expressly that hosts and visitors may see themselves
as they are.
We have been requested by the Council-naturally indignant
at the fictitious report in the morning journals, which puts into
the mouths of those who proposed and those who responded to
the toasts of the day, exactly the same fulsome and unmeaning
rigmarole of compliments and congratulations wbich used to
go down in times of less sincerity and straightforwardness-to
publish a sample, at least, of what was actually said by some of
the speakers at the last dinner.
The PRESIDENT, in proposing the Guests of the Day, remarked,
that a good deal used once to be said on these occasions of all
that the Art owed to the patronage of the nobility, and the
enlightened protection and interest of the Legislature. This
was all rot, of course, and they all knew it to be rot. The
mobility, if they had ever been the artists' best customers, had
long forfeited that character. Indeed, he doubted if they had
ever done much in the way of patronising native Art-con-
temporary Art, at all events. But, so long as the painters had
trusted to the Swells-he was a bit of a Swell himself, so he
hoped his language would not be considered
offensive or unbecoming--they had had a deuced
bad time of it—had, in fact, hardly been able to
keep body and soul together. He excepted the
portrait-painters; they had no doubt owed a
great deal to the nobility-or rather the nobility
had owed a great deal to them. They had
painted their family pictures, and had not always
got paid for them as punctually as might be. He
understood REYNOLDS had a heavy balance due
to him when he died; and he hoped this would
be a warning to SIR Joshua's successors in the
President's chair,he assumed they would, as
a rule, be portrait-painters—always to insist on
the rule of half payment before the first sitting.
But, except in the way of having their por-
traits painted, it was certain that, now-a-days,
at all events, it was not the Nobs who were the
painters' best patrons. They had to look to the
dealers first, and there were no patrons like
them, and he was sorry not to see some of them
at that table; and then to the rich manufacturers
and merchants—the men who made money and spent it, and who considered pictures the correct thing. Whether they knew or cared about
’em much was another question. So that their Lordships and the other Swells invited to this dinner must not suppose they were asked in the
character of patrons. "And if they didn't do much in the way of buying pictures, he was afraid they did about as little in the way of
knowing or caring about 'em. He lived with the class he was describing, and knew all about it. There was hardly one of them could
trust himself to an opinion about a picture; and if he did take a shot at that kind of game, ten to one it was a miss. No. The Swells were
there because it was creditable to the Academy to have them there; it put the R. A's. on a sort of level, for the moment, with the big-wigs
they were allowed to ask, and that was a great thing for a good many of the members who, unlike himself, were not born into that
class of society. Besides it kept up the prestige of the Academy out-of-doors, and that had a direct effect on their market. The Snobs bought
because they fancied the Nobs understood and admired : so that it was a very short-sighted yiew to take—and he had known such a view
taken within as well as outside the Academy, he was sorry to say, -that the money spent on the dinner was improperly withdrawn from the
cause of the Arts. It helped to keep up the credit of the Academy, to give them a tone in society; it afforded them a point of contact
with the " upper ten,” which in this country always pays in the long run. In point of fact he'd be bound to say there wasn't any £300
spent by the Academy in its schools, or its prizes, or any common-place expenditure of that kind, which brought them in as much money
as the £300 spent on that dinner.
LORD DERBY, in returning thanks for Her Majesty's Ministers, observed that he believed it was quite true, as the PRESIDENT had
said, that public men in this country didn't know much about Art;
but one thing at least he knew about it-it was a confounded nuisance
whenever it turned up in Parliament. There were a few fellows–ELCHO and Hope, and BENTINCK and LAYARD, and GREGORY and
DANBY SEYMOUR—who thought they knew something about it, and

PREFORM
THE POPE'S WAY WITH THE
BRIGANDS.
The Government of his Holiness the Pope is
commonly accused of being addicted to the
pursuit of tortuous courses. The subjoined
extract from a letter, quoted by the Corre-
spondent of the Times at Florence, however,
shows that the Pontifical Government is quite
capable of going very directly to work. A Papal
edict has at last been issued against brigandage.
It is evidently a straightforward measure; and
its effect has been excellent :-
“One brigand has cut off the head of another brigand,
and taken it to the authorities, and claimed the reward of
2,500 francs, promised by Government. It is the head of
a brigand of Sonnino."
This is one way of dealing with brigands-
short and simple. It enables a State to dis-
pense with judge, jury, and JACK KETCH, and
may be considered a saving plan; economical,
though costing £100 odd a-head. There is some-
thing ingenious in inducing the brigands to cut
off one another's beads. This process of mutual
decapitation is perhaps expected to go on till
there is only one brigand left alive-the "Last
Man" of the robbers and assassins. The POPE
will only have to catch him, and take his head
regularly by the official chopper, to be rid of the
whole lot. But perhaps the cheapness and
cleverness of making the brigands murder each
other are more obvious than the morality.

A WORSE STRIKE THAN THE TAILORS'.
The tailors' strike I do not heed,
Let dress grow costly as it will;
For if my clothes have run to seed,
Full many a day they 'll last me still.
But though it takes me years and years
To wear out long enduring suits,
I find that very short careers,
Alas! are run by strongest boots.
Patched garments will exclude the cold,
And hang together winters yet;,
Boots can be but a few times soled,
And then they will admit the wet.
For when the soles replacement lack,
The uppers soon want mending too;
Ere long each seam, and cobbled crack,
Will let the dust and water through.

The cordwainer's contented mind;
And there should be, in CRISPIN's trade,
A strike of journeymen combined ?

million lire. We imagine that the SIGNOR delivered this

WHY, AT LAST, I BELIEVE IN REFORM.
(BY A SCEPTIC.)
Till now I believed that Reform
Was a humbug by mere humbugs vaunted,
But now I begin to believe
That Reform must be really wanted.
'Tis not because BRADLAUGH and BEALES,
Like the three famous Tooley Street tailors,
For “the people of England” came forth
In Hyde Park, as un-railers or railers :
'Tis not because GLADSTONE maintains
The rights of our own flesh and blood';
Or the Star in its leaders proclaims
That whatever BRIGHT says must be good:
'Tis not that my faith I have pinned
To Jupiter Junior's thunder;
On Bob Lowe see the mark of the beast,
Or think John MILL can ne'er make a blunder:

But it is because here is Reform,
After travelling just the same road
All great questions have travelled before,
Disposed of in just the same mode.
Who was it loosed Catholics' bonds ?
Who was it swept Corn Laws away?
Those who for free Church or free trade
Bore the burden and heat of the day?
No; their hands that had still locked the door,
Were destined the key to apply:
Their voices that still had cried No,"
Were fated to register “Aye.”
So now that Reform is their pet
Whose bugbear it used to be known,
That what Radical treason was called,
Conservative wisdom has grown,
To me 'tis the proof of all proofs
That Reform's grown a fact for JOHN BULL,
That it ranks with the things he wants done
By the long, strong, and all-party pull !

A QUESTION which came the other day before a meeting of the
Middlesex Magistrates was whether the celebration of Mass should be
permitted in the House of Correction at Coldbath Fields. It was
negatived by the narrowest possible majority, 32 to 31. On the affirm-
ative side was urged the argument that Mass is now allowed to be
celebrated in the Government and other prisons. As the Protestant
party on the Middlesex Bench is in a majority of only one, no doubt the
celebration of Mass will very soon be permitted in all the prisons
which they preside over. DR. MANNING may be congratulated on the
progress which Popery appears to be making among the criminal
population.
