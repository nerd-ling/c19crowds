VERYBODY knows how hot it was that June Wednesday, and that the thermometer stood at 84° in the
refrigerator, but everybody does not know—assuredly MR. PUNCH does not—how many times he had replenished
with iced Hock-cup—and emptied—that big silver tankard which was brought unto him from America by HoRATIUs
Ponnius, the Hermit of the Haymarket. Somehow, MR. PUNCH subsided upon the grass by the river side, and burying
his grand nose in a mole-hill, dreamed. He dreamed that he was CADMUs. Perhaps he had been looking at CHARLEs
KEENE's sketch, above.
“I know I am CADMUs,” to himself; “but why am I CADMUs, and what put CADMUs into my mind 2 And
if you come to that, which CADMUs am I, the son of AGENOR, or the son of PANDION, or the executioner mentioned
by the other HoRATIUs—aut tradere Cadmo 2 I ought to know that, you know, but I don't. Perhaps I am all three,
like ORION.—no, I mean CERBERUS, or at least DIANA. It's very unpleasant not to know who you are. Who am I,
you mole,_you old mole in the cellarage 2 Can't you speak, you blind old fool 2 You can't see, but decent people
don't speak with their eyes, except young ladies. What do you say?—I am to run after a cow till she stops, and then
I am to call the place Boeotia? But suppose the cow runs after me, who'd be the Boeotian then, do you think?
Ha! have I got you on the horns of a cow—I mean a dilemma, but the moral's the same? I am so thirsty. Then
a dragon will eat up all my servants—well, I see no particular objection to that, and the dragon is the child of Ares,
and that is why he is partial to servants, who are also children of areas—tell you what, mole, you've been reading
LEMPRIERE's Lies and not DR. WILLIAM SMITH's Well-authenticated Statements—I shan't talk to you. I shall kill that
dragon, and extract his teeth, and sow them, and then I shall have a crop of letters, and the double teeth will make
double letters. I am so thirsty. And the men in brass are to be called Sparti, or the Sown. But men in brass,
—I didn't say anything about men in brass—I think you are all drunk. When the letters have fought and all killed
one another they are to be the ancestors of the Thebans. O, decidedly you are all drunk. Next I am to marry a
beautiful maiden called Harmonia. Well, that's all right, only mind that JUDY don't hear of it, or the harmony of
this meeting might be disturbed. I am to give her a necklace and a peplus 2 Anything to oblige, but what's a peplus 2

iv. PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [June 27, 1868.
Ear-rings 2 If you call me a fool I'll punch your heads. I am so thirsty. A long loose robe, without sleeves.
I know that without your telling me. Four daughters and a son, who might as well be a daughter too, because his
names's PollyDoRUs, and then I should have five daughters, which is just the right number, and I despise every man
who hasn't five daughters. After which I am to be changed into a serpent—then I shall not. I undo it all. There.
I won't be a serpent, so get out. I am as wise as a dove and as harmless as a serpent; and I am so thirsty. What
do you mean by only sixteen letters? I mayn't be quite right, but I know there are six-and-twenty, and you've stolen ten
letters—police —here's a mole been robbing the post-office, I mean the alphabet. Six-and-twenty letters, and sometimes
W and Y, also the digamma and amperzand. HARMONIA, my dear, where are you, and can you play the harmonium
in church 2 Hush, heathen country and no churches? I'll convert it and build a lot; but no ritualism, mind that—
none of that. I am so thirsty. Where's that cow gone? I can't see her, and I should like some milk-punch.
Where's the dragon, and where are the three jolly post-boys a drinking? I wish I was with 'em. I am CADMUs, am
I? Where are my letters, think you I meant them for a slave 2 Give me my letters. What do you mean by all
wrong, and that I did not sow teeth to grow letters?—tell you it's all right; look at the picture, a picture can't be
drunk, can it? though it may be a little cut. Ha! haſ your only wit o' the world. Come out of your earth-closet,
mole, will you? and let us hunt the cow. DR. WILLIAM SMITH says we are to hunt the cow, and he knows all about
it. I am so thirsty. I wish it was the cow with the iron tail, then I should get a drink, you old pump. Why am
I not changed into that serpent, according to the Doctor's orders, I should like to know. I'll choose my own skin,
though, mind that. I'll be a boy constructor. No, I'll be an adder, because I'm fond of arithmetic ; put down one
and carry two and let the rest walk. I'll be the Serpent of the Old Nile and go and see DR. Livingstone, my dear
brave friend. Only he might chop my tail off, not knowing me to be CADMUs-PUNCH. He'd be sorry, after, but all
the sorrow in the world won't sew a serpent's tail on. I'll be a viper, that 's it—a pen-viper—in allusion to my
mordant writings, and my wife shall be a viper—which indeed she is. I am so thirsty. My wife is a viper —”
“I have borne much, Mr. PUNCH,” said MRs. PUNCH, lifting him somewhat suddenly to his feet, “but I never
thought to hear myself called names. As, however, you are in no state to talk, I think you might be better on a sofa
indoors. Pray let no person witness your humiliating condition.”
He felt that he had deserved it that time, and obeyed in silence. He must have been very far gone, for he
actually forgot to publish his
fifty-fourt ºnlimt.

MR. PUNCH'S ALLOCUTION TO MANKIND.
BRTHREN AND PERSONS, - -
HERE we are again, and how do you do at the beginning of
another New Year P
I am quite well, I thank you kindly.
Nevertheless, Brethren and Persons, it cannot be denied that there
are many things which we must regard as misfortunes.
Oysters (I hope you all like oysters) are much too dear.
The old Opera-House º: of oysters) has been burned down.
We have only an armed truce with the Cabmen.
The Walrus is dead. -
c: are the dear little Hippocampi, that were like the Knights of
ess.
The miscreants who mend the roads won’t roll them.
. Women of the inferior class have not learnt from their betters to
discard Dorothy Draggletail dresses, and they be-plaster you with mud
as they come into an omnibus.
WHALLEY sits for ;º. -
Postmen are insufficiently paid. If they should strike?
There is º little holly this winter.
Music-hall slang-songs are sung by ladies and gentlemen.
The Street-Organ still rages, unstamped out.
Ritualism is rampant.
A good cigar is frightfully expensive.
So is matrimony.
The porters on the Underground Railway will not sound their H.
Mayors of Dover assail sea-sick Notables with addresses.
oung ladies write novels which make bearded men blush.
NAPOLEON is arming Twelve Hundred Thousand soldiers.
They have spoiled the beautiful front of the Travellers' Club.
Scotch bairnies are refused sweeties all through a four hours' service.
Irish stew is rarely made good;
Welsh rabbits are less digestible than ever.
People who had better hold their tongues—talk.
Smart stock-jobbers make slow puns.
THOMAs CARLYLE has published nothing lately.
You know who I mean has published a great deal. ..
Parliament meets in February–the only compensation (I admit a
grand one) is My Essence. -
alf-crowns have not been called in.
The Christmas-box extortion is not made felony.
Bumble is still blatant.
Crossing-sweepers beg. -
Shaving is incompatible with comfort, and soup with moustaches.
Few servants can boil . Slush or stone.
Boys learn Greek instead of French.
Gas is bad, and worst on Sundays.
I cannot publish myself every day.
-
These be griefs, but there are many consolations, Brethren and Per
sons. You have much to be thankful for. I am among you. My
Pocket Book is stupendous, and my Almanack gigantic; and, guided
by these, and by a reverent study of my hebdomadal pages, you will be
preserved from all sorts of evils too tedious to mention.
I wish you a Happy New Year. It is sure to be a lucky one, for it
begins on a Wednesday—the day of my issue to the World.
Begone dull Care, and begone all of you.
Early Satire.
A YouNg, lady sends us this...We don't see much in it, but it is
accompanied by so pretty a petition for its insertion, and by a photo-
graph which proclaims so much prettiness in the original, that we do
not like to refuse. She says, that at her Papa's table there was discus.
sion on the last horseflesh dinner, and her Mamma said, “Dear me,
how, nasty." They’ll eat donkeys next.” “I hope not,” said her
brother. “N.B. My brother is rather stupid.”
WOL. LIV.
Something like a Miracle.
A GENUINE double miracle has been worked in Brussels. Three
miscreant carpenters got into a church, and stripped an image of the
Virgin of all its jewels. They got off at the moment, but not only was
a policeman inspired with the power of seeing them, but he was
miraculously endowed with intellect which, enabled him to fetch
assistance, and seize them. There is something in Catholic miracles
after all. We are seldom favoured in the above way.;

WORKEIOUSE CURIOSITIES.
At a Conversazione of the Poor Law Commissioners, the following curiosities
were the other evening shown:—
Facsimile of the entry made in the Visitors' Book at Farnham, stating that
the Guardians had found the workhouse “in good order,” five days before the
probe of the Lancet was thrust in.
Photograph of a Poor-Law Inspector, as he appears when “inspecting” a
workhouse with his eyes shut.
Model of the “rabbit hutch” which the Farnham Guardians considered in
cold blood to be quite “good enough for tramps.”
A pair of damp sheets, from a poorhouse infirmary.
A bit of one of the hot bricks by which a girl was scorched severely, and was so
weakminded as to die in consequence.
Samples of workhouse wine in various stages of emaciation, showing its in:
creasing weakness in every hand through which it passes, from the master of
the workhouse down to the pauper nurse, until at length it reaches the poor
patient for whom it is prescribed.
Specimen of an infirmary blanket, warranted not to keep the cold out.
A slice of pauper Christmas pudding, curious as showing how much pudding can
be made with how few plums.
One of the toys broken by the order of a master of a workhouse, in order that
the children might not be too happy there.
Sketch (coloured) of the cesspool into which the epileptic Farnham pauper fell
perversely, and so died.
A specimen of hard, tough beef, administered to toothless paupers, when they
are ordered by the doctor a tender mutton-chop.
A bottle of air taken from a workhouse bedroom. In proof of its impurity, a
light being placed in it immediately goes out.
One of the newspapers removed by the late Master at Farnham, who feared that
the paupers might really be too comfortable.
A few stalactites found in the “Stalactite cave of filth” referred to in the
Lancet Commissioners' Report.
LE BLocus.--A French work has been reviewed in the Times called Le Blocus.
If translated into English, will it be entitled The Old Bloke *
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
I.
*TIs the time
For Pantomime;
Spend your well-stored farden;
o “the Lane,” now young 'uns come,
To enjoy Fee, Faw, Fum,
And own that BEVERLEY
Does the trick cleverly;
That in all Pantomimes,
Produced in our times,
Never did CHATTERTON
Out-do this latter one :
Then leaving “the Lane,”
As brisk as Cham-paigne,
You will find real PAYNE
At “the Garden'."
II
Advertisements had said
The Pantomime of Town
Was to be the Holborn one ;
I paid my money down.
Affliction sore
Long time I bore, . .
Musicians were in vain,
The “business” slow
It didn't go,
Nor I, to it again.
I only said I am a-weary, .
The fun comes not, I said.
I am a-weary, I am a-weary,
I would I were in bed.
III
Genuine good old Pantomime,
Very rare in this our time.
Now they are, as they’ve not been,
Getting few and far between.
And there are, pray note it down,
Only two Burlesques in Town
Y.Ybut one Extravaganza–
All fled, p'raps, to the 'Nyanza,"
Or some other distant clime,
With the shade of Pantomime.
To the Adelphi hosts repair, .
Making stoppage on each stair,
Till the cry’s “No Thoroughfare /*
Elsewhere ballets, plays and dramas,
Music Halls and Serpent Charmers,
Men who eat up swords like pies,
And do dreadful things with eyes.
Holborn Circus full of steppers—
Polytechnic lectures, PEPPER's.
Round and round and round we go,
Theatre, O ‘. Concert, Show. -
And when H. fth Day comes, we sigh,
“Dear me, how the time does fly!
To-morrow gone, to-day we’re here,
Christmas comes but once a year.”
SATURN FINDS SOME MISCEIIEF STILL.
THEY can't get their Astronomy right at Rome, but
they are improving. His Holiness says in his Allocution:-
“Saturn, his satellites, and his suns, do not cease to unchain
their fury in the most horrible manner against our religion."
Saturn, if we might hint as much to the careless secre-
tary who prepared this document, has eight satellites
certainly, but no suns, only three rings, which revolve, an
which are probably hateful to the Pörg from their habits
of revolution. But how the illustrious party unchain their
fury we do not understand. Saturn was always thought to
be rather a dull bird. ToMMY MooRE says, more or less,
“Only think what a world we should have of i here
If the haters of punch and the lovers of tea
Would but fly up to Saturn's cold comfortless sphere
And leave earth to such spirits as you, Mr. P.”
Saturn ought to have been more kindly treated by the
Pope, since Mentana, if only for the sake of the classical
image of an aged party destroying his own children.

GREAT DAYS AND EVENTs.
y BOXING DAY. As Burke says, the age of Christmas Boxes is
º past—for me: no servility of attention, no parade of †† would
/§ rocure me a single shilling. But it procures me a holiday.
--- he Public Department to which I am attached (devotedly) is
- liberal in the article of holidays, and Boxing Day is one of them.
I occupy it in recording a few current reflections suitable to
lum-pudding season. uld I do better? No, especially as the
og outside is so thick that I can scarcely see across Woobyrne
Place, and grey horses in cabs emerge from the mist like phantom
steeds. If the Society of Arts, who are laudably placing memorial
tablets on those houses
where eminent men have
lived, and loved, and
smoked, wish to know the
number of the mansion
occupied by }. contri-
butor, Mr. Punch, with
a view to inserting a meat

scribed “Here * * * * * *

communicate it to the
Secretary.
To revert to Boxing Day.
I hope it, will be mad.

of Parliament.
Envy is not *; those emotions of the mind (see DUGALD STEwART and SIR JAMEs
Mackintosh passim) which ought to be the liveliest at this season, but I have detected
myself envying WALTER FRANCIS, age 15, coming home from school for six, or rather five
weeks’ revelry—for the last week is embittered by the thought of returning to DR. CANE
and OvID's Metamorphoses—with his Christmas Box, if in these times of general gentility
there is such a thing, and it is not thrust aside by the gentlemanly º and the
olite valisse; and I foresee that I shall be envious of MINNIE, age, 10, MARY, age 12, and
HILIP, age 14, in their Christmas Box at the Royal Palatial Theatre, enthusiastically
delighted with Harlequin Little John, Sister Anne in the Tower, and the One-eyed Gnome;
and I should also envy, the same little, party, those Christmas boxes of bon-bons, which
Uncle ADRIAN will supply, did I not still retain my relish for crystallised fruits, which, if
I please, can jºf to repletion at SweetNUM AND JAsoN's. One more thought comes
with Boxing Day. ... I hope it is not inconsistent with the regulations laid down by the
Police Authorities, for members of the Force to receive those well-earned gratuities which
I apprehend everybody just now, will be disposed to give them ungrudgingly. -
§: YEAR’s DAY. What do I hear? The rustling of all those new leaves we are turning
over. What do I see? The inscription upon them in a firm hand of all those excellent
resolutions we have moved and carried nem, con, without the formality of a public meeting,
to get up earlier in the morning, to read through the entire works of SHAKSPEARE, MILTON,
GIRBON, and ADAM SMITH, in the course of the next twelve months, to take more exercise,
to lay by something, however small, for the pluvious day, to leave off flirting, to keep a
diary, to put down all our expenses, never to play more than sixpenny points at Whist,
gradually to give up smoking, and to discontinue that last tumbler.
Is there anything remarkable about the incoming 1868 to distinguish him from the outgoing
1867? I carefully scrutinise a certain Pocket-Book, not unknown to you, Mr. Punch, which
in the language of BLAIR, ARCHDEACON PALEY, DR. Johnson, and other standard authors
felicitously combines instruction with amusement, and is calculated equally to inform and
delight, and I find that this is Bissexstile, or Leap Year. Many reflections are the result
of this discovery in the Calendar.
Imprimis. Take any party of well-dressed, well-mannered people who will assemble within
the next week to dine or dance, and ask them, when the conversation flags, for an explanation
of the term Bissextile. Do I leap to a conclusion when I predict that their answers would
frequently be vague and incorrect.” My next thought is of the ladies. Leap-year brings
round again their quadrennial privilege of making, instead of receiving, matrimonial proposals.
Is there any well authenticated instance, say in the archives of the Statistical Society, of
a single woman availing herself of this traditional prerogative Just as SIR GEORGE Lewis
doubted the existence of a modern centenarian, so do I doubt, not that ladies make offers,
but that they make them because of, and only in Leap-year, which year will of course be the
year for those who joy in the diversion of hunting, and the occasion of a great many more
tremendous jokes, exhumed after four years hybernation, as I suspect that you, Mr. Punch,
will know to your sorrow before the infant year is many days old. Were I on your throne
I should without delay make it public that you
have contracted with one of your regular pur-
yeyors for a supply of levities amply sufficient
for your wants, and must decline to deal with
any other jokester. Lastly, I recollect with
sorrow that persons condemned to hard labour
in Public Departments will have to serve an
additional day in 1868 without the stimulus of
extra remuneration, but, as a compensation, I
remember the excellent dinnerishi get on the
29th of February in the Albany with PINKIE
WHITE, who is only born once in four years.
On further reference to the P-B. mentioned
before, I make myself master of a great mass of
useful information dealing with the Golden
Number, the Epact, the Dominical Letters,
which are not in any way influenced by the
Post-office Sunday Regulations, and the Solar
Cycle and Solar Ingresses, on all which subjects
I should be glad to have the opinions, between
the courses, or preparatory to the last fi in
the Lancers, of those festive parties to which it
has been proposed to refer the Bissextile difficulty.
I do not neglect also to ascertain the exact day
when the Jewish year commences, and the year
of the Mohammedan era begins, and for pur-
poses of abstinence I carefully note the date of
the recurrence of “Ramadan.” (Ladies and
Gentlemen, what is Ramadan P)
The Stamp Duties on Leases or Tacks, “with
or without any sum of money by way of fine,
premium, or grassum,” look interesting, but
they must be passed by for the Astronomical
Notices in which I regret to observe the same
º for other countries, to the neglect of
ngland, which is too often noticeable in the
behaviour of the Eclipses. If the assiduous
watchmen on the hill at Greenwich, who it is
reported have never had a night's rest for
years, wish to see the total Eclipse of the Sun
on August 18th, they must take their smoked
glass to the Cape of Good Hope or Mauritius,
and even the far inferior performance on February
23rd, the annular (MRs. MALAPROP is warned
not to confound this with annual) eclipse of Sol,
is grudged to a country which has produced a
DolloND and a FLAMsTEED. There will be no
irregularities this year in the conduct of the
|Moon, but a transit of Mercury over the Sun's
disk, which reads like one railway being allowed
running powers over another, will be partially
|visible at Greenwich (notice again the unwilling-
mess to give us full measure) unfortunately in
November after the Whitebait Season is over,
or the Astronomer Royal would have been happy
to see all the London stars (of the first and sub-
sequent magnitudes) to dinner at the Observatory.
ALTER ET IDEM.
THE Pall Mall Gazette—which has a relish
for the discovery of literary mare's nests, not
quite in keeping with other characteristics of
one of the best journals of the day — lately
echoed—with that cheerful alacrity which dis-
tinguishes its note in such cases — a cry of
“stop thief,” first raised in the Athenaeum,
against a certain unlucky DR. BURETTE,
accused of producing as his own, in London
Society, under the title “How I fell into the
clutches of KING THEopoRE,” a translation
from the German of F. H. APEL, published in
Zurich last year.
It now turns out that DR. BURETTE and
F. H. APEL are one and the same, in short that
it is a case of identity of person with a mere
difference of Appel-ation. Of course the Athenaeum
and Pall Mall have done penance for their
slander in their own sheets.

A CHRISTMAS CAROL.
THE year is dying in darkness and damps,
That shroud and chill the face of day,
The clinging fog-wreaths muffle the lamps,
Till you scarce can see them over the way.
Darkness—as if hope's light in doubt
And fear was dying far and wide :
Damps—as if Nature was weeping out
The sorrow that loads this Christmas-tide.
“Peace on Earth, and goodwill to men,”
So still ring out the Christmas chimes:
“Warfare on Earth, man's hate of men,”
So clangeth the tocsin of evil times.
At home or abroad, when the world we scan,
Or north, or south, by land or sea,
'Tis every man's hand against every man,
The Cyclone let loose and the Earthquake free.
Not for worship, but watch and ward,
In “merry” England we muster and meet,
From terror of fire our homes to guard,
Lest the mine be sprung at our children's feet:
The Nemesis of ill-deeds of old,
The curse that ever survives the wrong,
Are gathering round us, fold on fold,
With a sob and a shriek for their Christmas song.
Scared Authority stands aghast,
At sight of Anarchy's hideous face,
And sound of her shattering trumpet-blast,-
“Class against class, and race against race!”
Even our Gold and Labour fail,
In thousands on thousands of pauper-homes,
And fetid lazar-house, crowded gaol,
Throw a gloom on Capital's palace-domes.
Never was sorrier Christmas time,
Since Christ lay a babe in the oxen's pen;
Ne'er was worse discord of Christmas chime,
And the doings of Christian men.
Ne'er was it harder to feel the life
Christ lived on earth a living thing, .
Peace more than war and love than strife,
And present Winter the nurse of Spring.
Is there a blessing in this bale
That deepens round the dying year?
Shall Christ o'er Mammon yet prevail,
And love o'er hate, and joy o'er fear?
Shall eyes be cleared God's ways to trace,
Love in his chastening own confest ?
His lessons to read, his laws to heed,
So rarely learnt, until transgrest.
If strength in Christ's word still may be,
As we believe such strength abides,
The sin and sorrow that we see
Are seed of brighter Christmas-tides.
False trusts so sorely shaken now
Stronger foundations shall replace;
Anarchy, Fraud and Force shall bow,
Law, Love and Truth reign in their place.
** Obstinati Mulati.”
It is seldom worth while to correct, an error of the Press, and we
cannot think that it was at all worth the while of MRs. KAYE DE
STANTon, an American lady, to complain that in a recent anti-nigger
speech of hers, in which she meant to call her countrymen white
males, she was made to say white mules.

FENIAN FRIGHTS.
A SH.T DOMESTIC DRAMA.

SCENE–The Guards' Club.
Captain Hawkerly (to Ensign SHAKQ, who is going down with his men
on Bank duty). 'Spose you’ve heard the news 'bout these c founded
fellars, eh? -
hako (who has been studying the papers). The Fenians, you mean *
Hawkerly. Ya—as. They’ve sent to the ar—whathisname—
Shako (thinking he’s read it in the last edition). Oh, to the gas-works.
Hawkerly. No, no, to the ar—Governor of the Bank-
Shako (interested). Eh P -
Hawkerly. Yaas; to say they intend º the place. '--
Shako (uncomfortably). Blow up the Bank f Why—why—I’ve
asked some fellows to dine with me on guard. -
Wishes he could put them off, and himself too.
Hawkerly (carelessly). Have you? Wery jolly. Ta-ta. -
[Saunters off to another Club, where he has great pleasure in announc-
ing that young SHAko has got some fellars dining with him on
guard at the Bank, and that the Governor, &c., &c.
SCENE 2.-The Civil Service Club. Time, 6 P.M.
Bulsby, of the Foreign Office, and KYRTE, of the War Office, at the
writing table.
Bunsby. I must finish my letter off. Got to dine with little SHAKKY
at the Bank to-night. - -
Kyrie. Are you? I’m going too., I must just go to my rooms and
dress, and I’ll call for you if you like.
Bunsby. Very good. - -
[Erit KYRTE. Descending the steps he meets a Friend with CAPTAIN
HAwKERLY. Bunsby nods to Friend.
Friend. Any news in the latest editions?:
Bunsby (supposed to have read them all in the Club). No.
Captain #., *: at the opening). You haven’t heard, &c.
As they haven't heard, he tells them, with various additions about the
Governor, &c., SHAKO, &c., and the two fellars, by Jove, Sir,
dining with him. Erit BUNSBy thoughtfully. . -
Friend (leaves the Captain and enters Club. Seeing KYRTE just
leaving). Seen the latest, &c. -
[KYRTE hasn't: therefore Friend repeats the Captain's story as
“an official communication from some one who knows all about
it,” &c., about the Governor of the Bank, young SHAKQ, and the
jellars to dine with him, Sir. KYRTE oauses, then sits at table
and writes. Rings.
Enter Servant.
Kyrte, Send a Commissionnaire, at once with this to the Bank; and
when MR. BUNSBy calls for me tell him not to wait, but to go without
me. [Servant bows and retires. Erit KYRTE to dine at another Club.
SCENE 3.-Hall of Same Club.-Enter MR. BUNSBY's Servant.
Mr. B.’s Servant to Porter. Oh, you’re please to tell MR. KYRTE that
he’s not to wait for MR. BUNSBY, as he can’t go. - |
[Porter nods, writes it down, and erit Servant.
SCENE 4.—At the Bank. ENSIGN SHAKo on guard. Dinner ready.
Shako. Hang these fellows | Wish they’d be punctual. Thinks he’d
rather not dine alone to-day. Has also a sort of vague notion that there’s
more safety, under the circumstances, in company;
Enter Servant, with two letters.
Shako. Hullo! BuNSBY's writing. (Opens it.)
Dear SHAKKY, Very sorry can't come to-night. I am obliged
to leave town suddenly. Explain when we meet. Complimeuts of
the Season to you, old boy. Yours ever, JIM BUNSBy.
Confound it. “Obliged to leave town suddenly.” Bosh! He might
have sent this afternoon, and I could have filled his place. What’s
this? (Opens second letter.) From Old KYRTE.
Dear S. Can't come, . Laid up. Cold. Awful. See you soon.
So sorry. Bore a cold is . This by Messenger. Envy your jolly
party. Yours, heartily and Christmassily, FRED. KYRTÉ.
[SHAKo uses strong language implicating his friends and his enemies.
Servant (announces). MR, WERDE.
Enter WERDE, pleasantly.
Shako (heartily). That's right, old boy. (To Servant.) Dinner,
Jon Es, at once. Cold, isn’t it, eh?
Werde (warming himself). Yes. (Pleased with himself.) I’m the
first, I see. -
Shako. Yes, you are. (Makes light of it.) T'other fellows aren't
coming. Cold, or some dashed nonsense.
Werde. Ah, I’ve had a bad cold. (Says this to show to what inconve-
nience he has put himself in order to dine cith SHAko.) -
Shako (cheerily). Dinner will set you all right. (They sit.) Oysters.
Werde (after swallowing sir natives). Oysters deuced dear.
Shako. WILTON charges for 'em, no end. Chablis.
Werde. When l’m about the Strand (Says this as if he only got there
by losing his way,) I drop into RuLE's, in Maiden Lane. As good
oysters as amy, if not better, and a shilling less a dozen. (Drinks.)
Shako. Potage aux ocuſs?
Werde (pleasantly). Oui, s'il vous plait. (Both laugh.)
Jones (waiting briskly). Sherry, Sir?,
[VERDE takes Sherry, and they warm to their work. Conversation
leads itself up through the bad times for oysters to the bad times
generally, then to Fenians in particular.
Shako. I believe those fellows, KYRTE and
because they’d heard about the Fenians.
Verde (amused at the notion). Oh, absurd .
Shako. Of course: it’s deuced cowardly. (... he wouldn't have
minded being on duty somewhere else.) Why what on earth good would
it do those infernal scoundrels if they did blow the Bank up P
wº (pulled up short in the middle of his second glass of Sherry), Eh P
at,
Shako (explaining). Why, they’ve sent to the Governor to say that
they mean to blow this place up.
Werde (upon whom a sense of his situation is gradually dawning). Not
—not—this—ſ mean not here?
Shako. Yes. It’s true. If there was any advantage in it to them,
that would be another thing, but there isn't the slightest.
Werde (doesn't see this £; and looks at his watch, so as to pave the
way for saying presently, that he must be off now, got to go and dress for a
party in Bayswater). But they wouldn't—
[Pop—bang—whizz.
Verde (pale as his napkin). What the-
Shako (infected by his Friend's nervousness). By—I—
Jones (entering and going to Verde). Champagne, Sir P
[The sound is explained. The conversation is resumed with difficulty.
Werde. 'Pon my word, we live in awkward times.
[Bang bang, flop whop, against the door. Rattle of arms outside.
Both jump from their seats.
Verde (paler than two napkins). What was the-
Shako. It sounds like—
Werde. Your men's arms—
BUNSBY, stopped away
Both start up.
Enter Jones penitently, with fragments.
Jones. Beg pardon, Sir, but Islipped in opening the door, and the
tray’s gone, with all the things on it.
- [A pause: they have to wait. They drink.
Shako (to his Friend). What a nervous fellow you are.
Werde, (annoyed). No, I’m not. But (excusing the fact) I’m not
very well to-night. I-I-I shan’t stop long—I mean, I can't—in fact—
a party at Bayswater. (Crack, crack, sputter, and something hits him on
the cheek: he jumps up.) Good heavens ! (Is about to exclaim he’s
wounded.) *
Shako. It’s only a chestnut-Iput some on the hob, and quite forgot
all about 'em.
[Rises and removes chestnuts. After this the dinner continues, but is
hurried oper.
Verde (after cloth is removed). I—I’m sorry I must be off—really—
but (looks at his watch)—party at Bayswater. Good night. Enjoyed
myself immensely. See you again, soon.
Shako (annoyed). Good night.
[Erit WBRDE, and departs in the quickest Hansom. SHAKo returns
to his Guard, and indulges in the solitary pleasures of the table.
Thinks over friends, foes, theatres, the Derby, pigeon matches,
chances of hunting, debts, and finally sleeps peacefully before the
fire. END OF DRAMA.
Come, Wake Up!
CHRISTMAs will soon be over, let us get ready to pitch into one
another again. MR. JoHN BRIGHT is a public benefactor. He has
prepared the way for a jolly row when Parliament meets, or sooner. In
alluding to LoRD DERBY and the way the Tories had “done” their
friends on the Reform question, MR. BRIGHT said, “Turf Morals
will not do in politics.” Hooray, and LoRD DERby has race-horses.
There’ll be wigs on the green and Tories too. We will take care to
keep the epigram before the eyes of all whom it can possibly annoy.
“More Ates—stir them on.”
NOT SO BAD AS THEY SEEM.
MISTRESSEs show more consideration for their servants than is
generally supposed. Not long ago. MRs. FIDGITT was heard telling
MARY ANN that she had been scouring the whole house for her.

* BEGGARS OF BETHNAL GREEN.”
It is not all dark in East London. In spite of low . and short
commons, hard Guardians and promise of bitter winter, looms out of
labour, hearths out of fire, cupboards out of victuals, and toilers out of
heart and hope, there are some good soldiers of God even in that all
but dead level of ill-requited toil and soul-and-body crushing poverty,
who have still pluck to fight the battle not only of benevolence against
starvation, but even of culture against, ignorance, of beauty, against
ugliness, of taste against squalor. With the stout Rector, the Rev.
SEPTIMUs HANsARD–who deserves a Parliamentary Record of his own
—and who, with a catholic courage and cheerful charity that inspire all
about him, is to be found, where a pastor should be, at the head and in
the heart of every good work that goes on in Bethnal Green for the
souls or bodies, minds or morals, comforts or manners, education or
edification, reformation or recreation of his flock, a knot of gallant
and good men have banded themselves to bring into the East-End
one of those humanising institutions which have hitherto been thought
a special West-End luxury—a Museum of Science and Art. South
Kensington is to have an opportunity of radiating some of its super-
fluous light into the outer darkness of East London, and the Brompton
Boilers are to be made to boil in Bethnal Green, if the four stout
stokers under-written, can but get up the steam. Mr. Punch records
their names, not for their glorification, but for the information of all
who are inclined to aid in their good work. They are—
ANToNio BRAdy, J.P., F.G.S., Maryland Point, Stratford, Essex, E.
SEPTIMUs HANs ARD, M.A., Rectory, Bethnal Green, N.E.
John Moxon Clabon, 21, Great George Street, Westminster, S.W.
J. MILLAR, L.R.C.P. Ed., F.G. S., F.L.S., Bethnal House, Cambridge Road, N.E.
These four have made a conditional purchase of 4 acres of land at
Bethnal Green—being part of the Green itself. This site they have
offered to the Government, for the purpose of erecting, thereon a
Museum of Science and Art, and it has been accepted by the Govern-
ment as admirably adapted for the purpose, being within an easy walk
of upwards of a million of people, mostly of the artisan class.
This Museum is intended to be educational in the widest sense of
the word; and it is hoped that it may be the means of enabling our
workmen to compete on more equal terms than at present with the
skilled workmen of foreign countries, especially in matters of taste.
Government—the Circumlocution Office and, Red Tape to the con-
trary notwithstanding—has come heartily into the scheme. Parliament
has voted the money. The plans of the buildings have been prepared,
and the Government has already entered into a contract for their
boon to the East-End of London, is to pay for the land. The four
whose names we have given, have undertaken to raise subscriptions
for this. A further sum of about £2,000 is required, to cover the cost
of the land, and all other expenses. -
All else is ready. The contractor and his workmen are anxious to
begin, and, in anticipation of the completion of the purchase, the
vendors have even permitted the materials to be placed on the ground,
so anxious are they to facilitate matters. In one sense, therefore,
brick can be laid upon it until it shall have been paid for.
the poor, so many of whom are out of work, time is
Under such circumstances, these “Beggars of Bethnal Green”-not
“blind beggars,” assuredly-make their appeal for funds. If Mr.
Punch’s “Roo-too-it!” can serve as a trumpet-call in, such a cause,
these gentlemen shall have it. He echoes their appeal, and begs his
readers to answer it first, and echo it afterwards.
Subscriptions may be paid to the “East London Museum Account.”

and promoters of the scheme. - --- -
Finally, we may mention, that they have made it a condition with
the Government that the land not actually occupied by the Museum
buildings is to be laid out and kept up as an Ornamental Garden, and
that the Museum be open every week-day until ten o'clock in the

to fight the gin-shop and tap-room on fair terms. Both will be open
when the people, whom the one is meant to educate, and the other
serves to brutify, are released from work. The usual English rule is
to drive the people into objectionable places of recreation by shutting
up the unobjectionable ones when they are freest to resort to them.
But these promoters, knowing the place and the Fº they are serving,
have arranged matters, otherwise. Hitherto, the only flowers grown
in Bethnal Green have been those sad ones, which cheer, the gloom of
the poor weaver's garret, or the still sadder ones that glow with a
mocking splendour on the silk or velvet in the loom, at which twelve
hours’ daily toil hardly keeps life and soul together. These are surely
funereal flowers—flowers of sorrow and despair. The flowers that
blossom in the Museum Garden should be flowers of Hope. These
blessed flowers may be made to grow even under that sullen and
smoke-laden sky, and this effort is sowing the seed of them.
A FEW FRIENDS.
(FROM MY PHOTOGRAPH BOOK.)
TABLEAU XI.--THE LONG-ENGAGED.
Just to run over her family, and have done with them.
By the way, a cruel form of expression the above.
I said SoPHIA was the youngest of four, and the eldest of five. The
three first we have seen. The five after Sophia form the tail of the
CHERTTON family, its tip (not speaking as my Funny Friend would
say, in a sporting sense) being GEORGE FRANCIs Augustus, one year
and a half old, who cries whenever he sees me, causing MRs. CHERT-
TON to § to him in infantile language what I am and why I am
there, with little ill-natured remarks thrown in to the baby, but at me,
on my general personal appearance or my manner.
The other four are LYDDY, a pert, sharp girl of fourteen; John NY,
twelve years old, who's always at home on account of some illness at
school, and MILICENT, aged seven, who is of a malicious disposition,
and entirely under her brother's coercion. They are dreadfully de-
ceptive children, so quiet and demure when in their Mamma's presence,
so rude and boisterous when she’s away.
Once, on MASTER John NY coming up slily and knocking a book out
of my hand, I boxed his ears.
Never * will. I take upon myself to correct other people's
children. His two sisters (then ten and five) set upon me, he howled,
and ran straight to MRs. CHERTTON to complain. §. she came in
a tantºm, “What had JoHNNY been doing?” and “Why did I hit
I couldn't lower myself by saying, “Well, he hit me first,” which
was the truth; and I felt that I should be including myself among the
children if I entered into an explanation. On the other hand, to
suggest that the little brute was howling for nothing, would
only
elicit the reply (from him) “That he wasn't,” and from his Mamma,
that “Her children didn't cry for nothing.”
So I said “I thought he deserved it,” and offered no further remark.
Then there arose a storm. The elder sisters came in: all joined, even
SoPHIA THERESA herself, and the engagement was on the point of
being broken off then and there, had not old CHERTTon suddenly
come home from the City and brought unexpectedly two friends to
dinner. The old goose saved the citadel. John NY, got his ears boxed
ain by his Mamma for getting in her way, and subsequently meeting
the child on the landing, on his way up to bed, I made vengeful faces
at him, and then ran down stairs as quickly as possible, in order to
establish an alibi in case of inquiry.
We (THERESA and I) fell in love with one another in the country—at
a pic-nic. She was seventeen then. Everybody said it was too young
to marry. We were to wait till I was settled. For six years I’ve
been trying to get settled. Becoming Inspector under the Olfactory
Act was most unsettling. Before that, * tried every appointment
ever offered for public competition. Four years ago, I thought my
fortune was made, in consequence of the interest possessed by a distant
connection of mine with the Governors of Bedlam. I mean, I was to
have got the post of Secretary to the Lunatic Asylum. But, unfor-
tunately, on my presenting myself to the Governors, I found that there
was some mystification somewhere, and on mentioning the name of my
distant and influential connection, the gentlemen looked at one another,
then referred to an entry in the Hospital book, and there, sure enough,
was the name of my unfortunate relative figuring among the least
*. class of patients recently submitted to their care. I bowed,
and retired. I hadn't the heart to ask for the Distant and Influential.
It was a severe blow to my Great Aunt, who had always spoken of him
to me as “the cleverest member of our family, who will be of great
service to you one of these days.”
My Great Aunt could settle me, I believe, if she liked. But she
won’t; and I haven’t the smallest idea what’s in her will. She can't
allow me anything to marry on, she says, and, for my part, I believe
she doesn't want to lose my companionship. idon't think'she takes
lax views of society, but she is decidedly, averse to my marriage.
Sometimes she becomes pathetic, and says, “Ah, you’re getting tired
of me; I’m a nuisance and a trouble know.” and ºf: can reply
is, in a tone of kind remonstrance, “ My dear Aunt l’ though what f
am expected to say beyond this, I don't precisely know. She has
lately taken to driving into the Čity twice a week, to see her broker,
and has one penn'orth a day of the Times newspaper, from nine till
eleven, for the sake of the money article. Formerly, from economical
motives, she only had a ha'porth of Times per diem; that is she only
took in the advertisement, sheet with the births, deaths, and marriages
in it. However, she won't settle or make any provision for me... She
* to me that I’ve got my Olfactory Inspectorship, and that’s
enough.
#. being the state of affairs for six years, I have got so accustomed
to º: engaged to SoPHIA THERESA that f scarcely realise any other
position.
During the first, three months of our engagement, we were always
together. Gradually, we didn't see so much . one another. I didn't
miss her. I had begged old CHERTToN to let us correspond. It was
delicious—in its commencement. Aletter a day, crossed and re-crossed.
Verses, too. Then, º it came to “Dear THEREsa,—Sorry
have not time to write more, but must go out now on business. These
dreadful Factories Your ever devoted,” &c.
Then, in the next stage, I would say suddenly, “Confound it, I
haven't written to THEREsa,” and f}} apologise next day. Two
weeks passed without a letter, and then, going down at the end of
the month to meet her by appointment (a deuced bore, as I wanted to
dine with some fellows in town, and ’twas my last day's holiday), I
missed the train, and she was kept waiting for two hours, I brought
her a bracelet on that occasion, but it was acknowledged with a
frigidity which I felt, under the circumstances, I deserved. . . .
. Once I called on her, very hot and uncomfortable, and said, in an
injured tone, after seeing her receive the attentions of a good-looking
oung man in the Artillery, at a ball, “If our engagement wearies you,
HERESA, let us break it off. Don't let me stand in the way of your
happiness.” It was no good: she stuck to it, they stuck to it (I mean
the CHERTToNs) like leeches. -
I once hinted to my Aunt, confidentially, that she might take upon
herself to call upon the old CHERTTONs and refuse her consent. She
did call; but, : to the high state of nervous excitement she was
thrown into, fainted, and on recovery was supplied with such unusually
strong brandy as to render any communications on her part utterly
unintelligible.
On the day when my Late Friend prevented my departure for the
Continent I called at the CHERTToNs. -
Old CHERTToN was at home... Would I speak with him? alone *
decidedly: not being afraid of Old CHERTTon. Well, then, what he
had got to say, was, in fact—it was—ahem' delicate. It took him an
hour to break the intelligence to me that SoPHIA THEREsa had fallen
in love with somebody ºf. and he left it to my kind sense of, &c., &c.,
honour, &c., &c., and so forth. At that moment, I felt I could have
done anything for Sophi. Theresa. As for the man (it was the
Artillery officer) I could have * his hand and called him my true
friend. I believe, on meeting him, I complimented him on *
like an officer and a gentleman; but I haven’t a notion of what
meant by it. Qld CHERTTON wept, and said I had a generous noble
nature. This pleased me, and I have allowed him to remain under
this impression. I saw SoPHIA THERESA for two minutes that even:
ing: pressed her hand; said “Good bye,” turned away, and hurried
off. I went to a supper º the same night, and never was in such
spirits. I said º funny things that even GRIgg laughed, and at
last I utterly outshone him in his own peculiar line.
As I write, I am free, free as air, I mean as an engaged man. I
send back her letters with pleasure. The presents among them, a set
of studs and wrist-links, I am bound in honour to return. I regret it.
But on the other hand, back came my bracelet, two rings, a brooch.
They’ll do for another time.
To-morrow I go for my holiday, whether my Late Friend will come or
not. I’ve only got one call to make, that is on my Portable Friend
(this next picture), who wishes to give me some advice about travel-
ling, and then I close my photograph book for the present.

ITALY is said to be organising an army on a footing of 1,641,000 men.

- THE PRIDE OF THE JUSTICES.
CERTAIN functionaries have gone up in the world's market. MR.
THOMAS CARLYLE has been made a Justice of the Peace for Dum-
friesshire, the county that has the honour of claiming him as its son.
Justices of the Peace not being invariably selected from the Articu-
late Classes, an inaugural address on appointment is, mercifully for
many, not customary. But we hope that the philosopher of Chelsea
will, if he condescends to take his place, favour his colleagues with a
few ideas. One thing is certain, he will not
“Shake the country bench with clumsy wit,
When he the dullest of dull things has said,
And then ask pardon for the joke he made.”
We should like to hear him imparting to a culprit the fact, that as the
latter managed his Can do in a way his fellows can't stand, he must
withdraw from the activities, and it may be not without hide-cutting,
study to be quiet. Many a happy new year to True Thomas.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SLAP AT THE FRENCH STAGE.
ERILY, whatever Anglophobiacs
may say, there are some things
which they do not “manage
better in France.” For in-
stance, take the Censorship,
both of the Press and of the
Play-house. How would free-
born Britons like to go with-
out their Punch, if only for
one week, because it had said
something obnoxious to the
Government, and had therefore
been , suspended ?. Qr, how
would playgoers in England
like to go without their SHAR-
sPEARE, because the Censor-
ship had found out that he
wrote not for an age but for
all mortal time, and that such
: a line, for instance, as
“Uneasy lies the head that wears a
crown."
might be interpreted to mean
a sneer against the reigning
Sovereign?
- WICTOR HUGO's Ruy Blas
has been prohibited in Paris, for the reason, it is thought, that.the
play contains a speech against the Ministry of Spain, and the Minis- |d
ters of France, have found that the cap fits them. If Censors are so
sensitive, it will be difficult for playwriters to avoid giving offence, for
sneers against a Government might be plausibly detected in most com-
monplace assertions. In a nautical drama, all allusions to a vessel
might be looked at as referring to the vessel of the State, and such an
innocent command as “Clear away the top hamper” might be viewed
as recommending a clearance of the House of Lords, as hampering
the State vessel. - -
Fond as are our Fº of adapting from the French, they would
hardly like to see the French Censorship adapted here. How Brown
would stare on hearing that his burlesque was prºte: because he
had inserted a pun on the word “Sovereign”! What expletive, of
vehemence would Jones use in his wrath, when told that his fine
comedy—the work of half a life-time—could not be produced, because
the Censor had discovered that the words “Oh, hang that king !” were
spoken in a scene where a game of cards was played If the French
Censors were but half as strict in looking to the morals of the plays
which they permit, as in examining the language of those which they
Fºg º: English should consider that they really did some service
to the State.
ONE THING QUITE CERTAIN.
UNTIL further informed, Mr. Punch is uncertain whether he should
begin the next paragraph thus:-
“There is a well-meaning person trying to raise money for charitable
purposes,”
Or thus,
“There is a photograph-seller trying to get off his wares.”
The fact being that Mr. Punch knows nothing about the party, except
that he advertises in one º: that he wants to sell photographs for
one charity, and in another expresses similar wishes in regard to a
different charity. Therefore, Mr. Punch neither assists, nor exposes.
But he has one thing to say. One of the advertiser's baits offers an
alternative, namely:-
“Portraits of Twelve English Bishops,”
Or, if preferred,
“Twelve Copies of your own Carte de Visite.”
Distinctly, should Mr. Punch accept either, the Latter. Most dis-
tinctly. He prefers his own Fº to the likeness of any twelve
hierarchs in the universal world, bar none, from Pius THE NINTH to
CRowTHER the Negro. Ha! haſ He should think so. No doubt
there.
A Lather of Naples Soap.
THE Mediterraneo, a Bourbonist organ at Naples, advocates the
claims of that city to be the capital of Italy, enumerating, as grounds
of its superiority over all rivals, “its blue sky, its burning Vesuvius,
its lively and intelligent population.” We wonder it did not add to
the list of recommendations, its stinks, its sirocco, and its lazzaroni.
These would seem to be at least as good grounds of preference as a
scorching sun, an active volcano, and a feather-headed people, hot as
the one, and liable to eruption as the other.
WOL, LIV. c
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
LADIEs, please to look at this important news from Paris:—
“It is evidently the determination of our modistes that fur shall play an impor-
tant part in toilettes during the ensuing winter. A fancy of the moment is for
ladies to wear not only the skin but the head and paws of a sable, an ermine, or a
Canadian marten on their muffs, and strange enough these look, with the pointed
head and sharp piercing eyes of one of these little creatures, flanked by its two
paws, peering over their tops. It is further a fancy to wear one of these little
animals round the neck, with its tail thrust into its mouth as it were.”
Happy the, animal whose fur is out of fashion 1 . How many little
creatures will be hunted down this winter, simply for the cause that
their fur happens to be fashionable ! The modistes determine that
ladies shall wear muffs with a sable or a marten on them, and of course
the ladies bow to the imperative behest, and never dream of thinking
of the deaths which it occasions. , Merely to gratify “a fancy of the
moment,” sables, ermines, and martens are slaughtered by wholesale,
and if the fashion did not change, would speedily be numbered with
the mastodons and mammoths, and other extinct animals.
Another piece of Paris news may also interest you, Ladies: —
“Plain silk sashes terminating in a deep fringe, and tied in large bows at the
waist behind, are worn with redingotes, and ordinary toilettes de promenade, made
of some richly-embroidered silk, worked over with flowers, buds, insects, anchors,
horse-shoes, and even such things as a highland bonnet; and with their long ends
passed at the back of the waist, through gold rings encircled or surmounted by gilt
ornaments of a more or less grotesque character, they are largely in favour for
evening wear. These ornaments comprise such objects as a banjo, a sailor's hat
and anchor, a yacht and a coil of rope, a group consisting of a peaked cap, whip
dog, and gun, with a twisted hunting horn beneath, a strung bow, arrow, and
quiver, rings, chains, and fetters, monster dragon-flies and bees with their wings
in gold filigree, the latter intended of course to be worn with such scarfs as are
perfect parterres of flowers, and a lock and key, both large enough for a prison-
oor.”
Dressmakers have queer ideas of what is ornamental.., Imagine any
lady, with the slightest sense or taste, wearing any of the ornaments
here spoken of as fashionable ! Monster dragon-flies and bees appear
to us about the best of them, and perhaps we next may hear of
monster frogs and cockchafers; , But fancy a girl wearing a banjo, or a
horse-shoe, or prison lock and key, and being under the delusion that
they prettily adorned her | Why, if this ugly fashion spreads, we shall
hear of ladies wearing a trombone at their waist, or coming to a party
with a poker at their back, or a bootjack or a coal-scuttle dangling
down behind them.
A REMARKABLE REQUIEM.
A CoRREspondent of a Fenian Irish newspaper relates that “a
solemn requiem mass” was performed, the other day, in the Parish
Chapel of Ennistymon, Clare, “for the souls of our martyred fellow
countrymen,” as he calls the criminals hanged at Manchester. Sub-
joined is an extract from his bletheremskite:–
“The choir performed MozART's Requiem amid solemn silence. A half-
smothered “amen' broke from out that silence when the good priest said, “My
dear people, pray for the souls of those noble-hearted men, and also pray that God
may save Ireland." Scarcely a dry eye was to be seen in the church, and I said
within myself, ‘Ireland is not yet dead—all are not yet gone with a vengeance.”
The people were now standing up to leave the chapel, when, like a thunder-clap,
broke on their ears the chorus ‘Tramp, Tramp.’”
It is wonderful that such a service as that above described should
ever have been celebrated. What necessity was there to sing a mass
for the souls of martyrs Is not martyrdom a direct passage to
Paradise? Surely the “good priest” who called BRETT's mur-
derers “noble-hearted men” must think BRETT's murder an act of
Christian heroism—an act of faith. Let us hope that such is not the
view taken by the priesthood in general of rebellion against the consti
tuted authorities, and shooting an officer in the execution of his duty.
The chorus of “Tramp, tramp,” is rather, a remarkable, sequel, one
thinks, to a Missa pro Defunctis. We shall, see, by-and-by, perhaps,
whether or no this kind of thing takes place “permissu superiorum.”
But perhaps the whole story of this alleged mass is an Irish hoax.

“DR. Gillooly, Roman Catholic Bishop of Elphin, at a Meeting to

astonishment at the “mania of blind, remorseless hatred against the
Pope which exists among the great English people.'"
THERE was an old Doctor Gillooly,
Whose tongue was a member unruly,
And he talked at Roscommon,
Like any old woman,
Or worse, like a bigoted Fooly.
GILLooly's inveterate bias
Induces that cove to belie us,

against that way of meeting a complaint, and added “It

A PLEASANTRY OF PENNY-A-LINING.
In the Pall Mall Gazette, the other week, appeared a letter from
f| “An IsrAELITE,” complaining that whereas when a Christian of any
denomination is charged before a Magistrate with any act of dis-
honesty, reporters never mention his religious creed, whenever the
person accused of such an offence is one of the Hebrew º;
they always take care to describe the prisoner as a Jew. But surely
this practice ought to give no offence to “AN IsPAELITE.” When a
member of the Church of England, a Roman Catholic, a Methodist, a
Baptist or Dissenter of any kind picks a pocket, robs a till, breaks open
a house, passes bad money, or receives stolen goods, he does no more
than what people in general know well enough that many others of his
persuasion are quite capable of. They see nothing extraordinary in
the commission of any theft or fraud by a fellow-Christian. But when
a rogue or a thief happens to profess the Jewish religion, that does
appear to them a very extraordinary circumstance. As such it strikes
the reporters. When they note that the culprit is a Jew, what they
mean to denote is that he is a scandalous exception to the generality of
Jews—a pretty fellow, as the familiar saying is, to call himself a Jew:
On consideration of this way of putting the case, “AN IsbAELITE’”
must see that the Children of Israel have cause to acknowledge a com-
pliment, and not to resent an insult, in the practice which he reprehends
on the part of the historians at a penny-a-line.
More Good News.

boys home from school say—that Paraguay is in America, and it’s
as likely to be there as anywhere else. We know nothing more on the
subject, but that does not make us less rejoiced at this happy pacifica-
tion, and we are quite equal to see fireworks if there is a Paraguay
Ambassador, and he likes to treat us.

[JANUARY 11, 1868.
THE POPE ON THE PEA-HENs.
-----
The Pope has issued a decree against the extravagant style of dress
tº: by the Roman ladies. He complains that the Romans seem
to forget that a church is the House of God, and that “probably the
cause of the evil is to be found in the conduct of the women, who
when they go to church dress as if for a theatre or fashionable
promenade.”
Poor, dear, old Pio NoNo! If he feels all this about the ladies at th
St. Peter's what would he say if he saw them at St. Barnabas'?"
Suppose Protestant pastors were for once to take a leaf out of the
book of the Papal pastor-in-chief, and to pour from their pulpits, on
a set Sunday, a combined volley, on the vanities of butterfly bonnets,
the enormities of chignons, and the sinfulness of sweeping tails?
The Cardinal Vicar, publishing the Pope's decree, announces that
women with extravagant head-dresses are not in future to be admitted
to the Communion-table. English ladies may argue that they would
not fall within that prohibition, seeing that their head-dresses, so far
from being extravagant, are becoming small by degrees and beauti-
fully less, till they threaten to vanish altogether—unless, indeed
“hair” be considered as head-dress, in which case it must be owned
that chignons are extravagantly dear, and Auricomous fluid as costly
as if it were, indeed, the liquid gold whose name it usurps, instead of
chloride of potassium.
Perhaps, when pulpit eloquence becomes practical, we shall hear
sermons preached from a certain well-known passage, in which one of
the greater prophets has relieved his mind against the fine ladies of
Jerusalem, º the necessary adaptation to the fashions of our own
day. Whenever and wherever that text is properly handled, Mr. Punch
will be found with his Judy—to point its moral, as pulpit morals should
be pointed, at the wife of his bosom.
In the meantime the fact that the Pope has led the way in the
crusade against the fantastic extravagance of ladies' toilettes, supplies
the best argument we have ever met with in favour of the celibacy of
the priesthood. The Roman Catholic priest can afford to pitch into
the pet sins of the sex. The unfortunate British Clergyman, a model
paterfamilias in enjoyment or expectancy, knows that that ground is
taboo to him, and is reduced to dilate on masculine enormities.

A BIRD OF GOOD OMEN.
The old Army Stick-in-the-Muds have got it now. Hooray for the
§. Cºntrollerin-chief Down with the Logs, and up with the
TORKS
A FENIAN WITH A CHIGNON.
ALLow me, Mr. Punch, to congratulate you (although somewhat
late) on the gallantry which has induced the Fenian conspirators to
make women partakers of their plot. Of course we know all about it.
Thank the “American Fenian” who, in addition to the enlightenment
which she afforded us on that subject in Tinsleys' Magazine, has been
so kind as to give us a little more in the Pall Mall Gazette.
Why do I take that writer to be a woman? In the first place
because she has let the cat out of the bag. In the next, because she
writes in the spirit of a woman who is as mad as a snake, yenting her
spite intaunts of the same import as those which, spoken by low females
sometimes occasion wives to be stamped upon by their husbands, an
account for the black eyes exhibited by many of the weaker sex in the
slums. Thirdly, the unreason of this American, that is, of course,
American Irish, Fenian is more than Irish! It is feminine, too. It
transcends that of the Irishman. It plainly bespeaks an Irishwoman.
Let us call her BIDDY.
BIDDY will have it that we are allaset of hypocrites for saying that the
Fenians who murdered BRETT were hanged for mere murder. She
insists that their punishment was a political execution. BIDDY seems
never to have asked herself, whether, if the accomplices in rescuing
whom they shot a policeman, had been mere thieves, her Fenian friends
would not have been certainly hanged all the same.
Because the murder of BRETT was committed on behalf of fellow-
traitors instead of fellow-thieves, BIDDY argues that it was the mere
incident of a political act, and not murder at all at all. Killing is no
murder when it is treason besides, according to BIDDY. Treason makes
murder justifiable homicide.” At this rate the assassination of MR.
LINcoln was a political act, and what sanguinary tyrants the American
Government were to hang the confederates of Wiikes Bootſ -
Then Brony calls the hanging of the Manchester Fenians a political
execution. If it was not a political execution, a merely political exe-
cution, why, asks Biddy, were soldiers stationed to guard the scaffold.”
Och, sure, not because it was a political execution, but only because it
was thought to be one by some spectators of Biddy's way of thinking,
who would, as BIDDY knows, then and there have repeated the ver
crime for which the convicts were to suffer, if fear had not restraine
em.
Why, if the killing of BRETT was murder, inquires BIDDY, don't we
demand of the United States Government the extradition of those
Fenians concerned in it who ran away, and got off to America? Whether
or no that deed was murder the American judges, she says, might be
trusted to decide. Might they? No doubt they might in a parallel
case—if a party of conspirators, engaged in a plot for Southern inde-
pendence were, in the attempt to rescue an accomplice from custody,
to shoot an officer of the United States in Washington or New York-
º in case any of them were British sympathisers., Does
IDDY entertain any doubt that American judges would send the per-
formers of such a political operation to the gallows? Performed at
Manchester by American Irish Fenians they would possibly consider
it quite another thing.
or one hint which BIDDY is so kind as to offer us, we are her debtors.
She says that the English people are no longer loyal, and suggests that
they have become disloyal from not seeing so much as they once saw
of Royalty. This is so far from being exactly true that the demonstra-
tors in #a. Park would probably, on invitation, have at any time
given three cheers for the QUEEN. But the disaffection of a minority,
which exists, has certainly grown up in Royalty’s absence, and most
of it might, doubtless, be very soon dispelled by a due exhibition of
the light of the Royal countenance. Let us be grateful to BIDDY for
a hint which she will be vexed to see most graciously taken. -
Poor BIDDy! She, and the men she is mixed up with, would fain
taunt or frighten us into treating Fenians, even if assassins also, as
prisoners of war. Oh yes, and give them the position of belligerents!
As if we were, as the schoolboys say, so jolly green. But perhaps,
Mr. Punch, I am mistaken all this while. The “American Fenian”
may be no. BIDDy, but a loyal Briton, masquerading in...green petti-
coats. Others also, who want us to treat Fenians as belligerents may
really be their deadly enemies in disguise. Talk, to us of acknow-
ledging the Fenians' belligerent character, and allowing, them belli-
gerent rights! With the view, perhaps, of causing us to take very
good care that there shall be no mistake upon that point-by hanging
without mercy every Fenian we can catch. But we won't lose our
temper. Only when policemen are shot dead in the discharge of their
duty, whether for the rescue of a traitor or a thief, we shall continue to
treat their assassination as murder, by the lave of BIDDY, darlint, and
her associates, or widout their lave, bedad, and by JINgo.
A Plant in Season.
Now is the time of year when Managers of Theatres show abotanical
taste, for there is not one of them who does not do his best to have a
great rush at his doors. -

THE ANTI-FENIAN ORATOR.
THE moments of wise hesitation are past
And the Bromwicham Statesman has s oken at last,
To say, in grave times, just the thing that is right
Whom could you expect, if not loyal John BRIGHT!
How mild and forbearing the censure he throws,
In dignified strain, on political foes! -
Their acts with what candour and justice he weighs,
And qualifies blame, where he can, with due praise!
How little resentment you hear him express
Qf free comments made on himself by the Press!
As ready at taking or giving a stroke,. .
He simply refutes them, or passes with joke,
And now, when good men, of all parties and creeds,
Unite against doers of villanous deeds,
How nobly, above the mere demagogue's view,
esoars in denouncing that infamous crew
John BRIGHT has a heart, and he is not ashamed
To say that he pities the killed and the maimed,
And hates all the dastards who plot and conspire
Toblast and blind women and children with fire.
He dares to speak out like a trueman of
Against Fenian traitors who shoot the Police,
For law and for Order, he takes his firm stand:
You heard his voice, trumpet-like, ring through the land.
He’s nomanto offer a ready excuse,
With weak condemnation of treason broke loose,
Qn stump and on platform he ever contends
Against England's foes, on the part of her friends.

A hundred miles would not the wise go to hear?
How great is their wisdom who lend him their ears,
And hail his right loyal orations with cheers!
A COMPETITOR FOR THE PLATE.
MR. PUNCH,
WHERE, it is asked by people apparently concerned about
us rather than themselves, do we go to when we, die? They
mean to inquire what becomes of our carcases, proverbially never seen.
They denyus spirits—otherwise than as the United Kingdom Alliance
would deny gin and whiskey to people sufficiently like ourselves to be
content with mere water. Yet who knows that it is not our, ghosts
who rap, the tables through which some persons think, with some
reason, that they correspond with their deceased relatives?
... We do not die; we disappear. That would do pretty well for the first
e of a “spirit-song,” of average quality. It would, however, express
only partial truth. We die fast enough; though it is true that we
disappear in an unaccountable manner. Now, Sir, allow me to propose
our claim to have our disappearnce visibly accounted for. Intercede
for us that we may be decently put out of sight. I do not propose a
plea for any funeral rites. Those who care about the disposal of their
earthly remains, as such, have less head by half than we have, and two
fewer legs. But do not let us go to the dogs—and the cats. Hip-
phagy, Isee, has just been imported from France. Why should not
nophagy be tried in England? I will venture to back myself for
tenderness and flavour, to afford as good a steak, a round, an aitch-
bone, a sirloin, to yield quite as good a consommé, an escaloppe, an
eminée, a culotte, a fileſ piqué; yes, or as good oil as that noble animal
the horse, as he is offensively styled. I am as a clean a feeder, and a
daintier drinker. Why do I want to become food for Man rather than
any of the other carnivora!' ...Not because I have so little sense as to
desire a fancy sepulchre in the human stomach. ...Notwith any silly
concern for this carcase, dead and senseless, but with a sensible regard
for it living. If you eat me, you will take good care that I shall be
well, and º and fattened when past work, and you
will have me dispatched at once by the butcher, instead of being left
to perish almost as wretchedly as a pauper is. You will, on the con-
trary, make my latter, days as easy as those of the horse whom you
mean to devour. I i. then, you will see that, in asking to have
the flesh of us fellows tried to see if it is not equal to horse-flesh, I am
by no means an unwise animal, although you may write me º,
88.
P.S. How do I contrive to write? How do some other donkeys?
ContRARY toº ExPECTATION.—It is, rather disappointing at a
Christmas party, when º have been told that a girl is pretty certain

DENSE DARKNESS AT FARNHAM.
WHEN º are illiterate, blame the ºp of the diocese,
According to this rule what will MR. BRIGHT say of a right reverend
prelate who lives at Farnham, and under whose nose the following
address was composed, the Times informs us, by abody of gentlemen:-
“To the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and Guardians of the Farnham Union.-We
the undersigned ratepayers and inhabitants of the several parishes constituting the
above union desire to convey an expression of our entire confidence in you as the
representatives of the ratepayers, and that (sic) you have, in our opinion, at the
sacrifice of much valuable time and anxious labour (although fettered with legal
and official restrictions), performed the duties of your office in a most just and
conscientious manner. eat the same time beg to express our extreme et
that you should have been subjected to the serious charges recently made st
you, and which (sic) have occasioned the late painful inq .”
What may the state of education among the rustics in the neigbour-
hood of Farnham be supposed to be, when a number of gentry are
found capable of writing such as that above annotated Will
the Honourable Member for Birmingham omit to take the opportunity
afforded him by the publication of the foregoing address of denouncing
the Bishop of Winchester? - -
It will probably, however, be questioned whether, the intelligence,
evidenced by the specimen of English written by a body of Farnham
gentlemen, is not very considerably higher than the moral qualities
with which it is associated. By what conduct have the Farnham
Guardians and their Chairman earned the confidence of the ratepayers?
By making all proper arrangements for rendering their workhouse a
healthy and comfortable abode? If so, the “painful inquiry” into
the state of that institution will issue in a report which must give all
parties to its management extreme pleasure. Of course they will be
gratified to hear their asylum for the infirm and sick poor everywhere
referred to as the Model Workhouse.-In that case beneficence will
rove to have been supra grammatican—only a rather too exalted
eficence. But the enthusiastic recognition, in bad English, of a
mere saving of rates, argues a stinginess not above bad grammar-a
not too exalted stinginess. .
However, the gentlemen in question may indignantly deny that they
are stingy; for-
“A subscription list has also been opened for the purpose of raising a fund for
the purchase of a testimonial to be presented to MR. S. Nicholson, Chairman of the
Board, the contributions to which are limited to 5s, and solely collected from the
ratepayers and inhabitants of the parishes comprised within the union.”
Solely collected from the ratepayers of the Union, and the inhabi-
tants of the parishes thereinf . if the workhouse of Farnham
Union is the model workhouse, the subscription for a testimonial to its
Chief Guardian should be open to the universe. The Farnham Work-
house is at any rate, universally celebrated. The amount of subscrip-
tion should also be limited to the lowest coin, to enable poor people on
the brink of pauperism gratefully to join in it. A handsome service of
gold plate might be provided with their united coppers.
As it is, perhaps the testimonial most suitable for presentation to
the Chairman of the Farnham Board of Guardians would be a copy of
the New Testament, handsomely bound, together with an equally well
got up volume containing the complete description of Farnham Work-
house compiled from the Lancet.
A DEAL IN A NAME.
We learn from the Pall Mall Gazette that a vivacious Wet, called
QuARK, advertises, a lotion for strains by the euphonious title of
CLARK’s “Neurasthenippouskelesterizo.” The name, if not the physic,
is evidently extracted from Greek roots, and resolved into its elements
means, "I strengthen the weak nerves of horses’ legs.”...... We
may this becalled CLARK's medicine! It needs a “learned clerk,” indeed,
to swallow such an amount of heathen Greek, and still more, to get it
up again.
W. should like to hear the Whitwall or Black Hambletonyersion of
this cacophonous compound. If crackjaw constitutes a title to trial
on cracks' legs, MR. CLARK may claim such a trial for his lotion. We
should recommend him to offer a prize of a dozen bottles to any
trainer or stud-groom who succeeds in pronouncing the word, and
two dozen to any one who achieves the tremendous feat of writing it.
A DESIDERATUM.
THE new Master of Eton is named HoRNBY. Considering how Eton
boys spell, a better name were HoRNBook?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TRUTH IN BLACK AND WHITE.
PUNCH is once more in the black books of the Black Country for
his lines on the translation of Bishop SELwyN from New Zealand to
Lichfield and Coventry.
He had the same crow to pick with the same cavillers some twelve
months ago, when, in an article entitled “The Black Country: is it as
Black as it is painted?”" he gave his reasons for what he had said
in some lines on the inauguration of PRINCE ALBERT's statue, at
Wolverhampton, as to the state of morals, manners, and education
among the workers of that region of coal and iron. He begs to refer M.R.
LAwley, of 27, Broad Street, Bilston (correspondent of the Birming-
ham Daily Post), to that article. It would be superfluous to reprint
here the extracts from the Report of the Children's Employment Com-
mission of 1864, therein quoted. But if MR. LAwLEY has not got that
report, let him get it, and read, mark, and inwardly digest it.
R. LAwLEY keeps up the character of Bilston for strong language.
We give his letter the benefit of such publicity as Mr. Punch can
help him to, though we hardly see how that will help him, if we are to
accept as gospel the comment which the editor of the Daily Post has
appended to his letter:—
“[There is one consolation. Punch is only looked at for the sake of the pictures;
nobody reads him now.—Ed. D. P.]"
If this be true, we cannot understand how MR. LAwley came to
know of our offence; and, above all, why he should be so angry at it.
Perhaps, even if Mr. Punch is not worth reading when he writes in
#. persond, MR. LAwLEY’s letter may gain him some readers. MR.
Awley charges Mr. Punch with writing—
“Of ‘Wednesbury roughs,” “Tipton cads,’ and ‘Bilston Bullies,” as though he
had been asleep, a la Rip Van Winkle, for half-a-century, and was describing people
of that remote period. Associated with such characters, one wonders he did not
mention “cockings,’ ‘bull baitings,’ ‘highwaymen," and ‘blunderbusses.’
would have made excellent materials for such poetry (?) as his ; but even Punch
knew that that would have been a little overdoing it.
“If Mr. Punch believes that the Black Country is the same now as it was fifty
years ago, he must be a very antiquated old fellow indeed. He knows well enough,
I take it, that “moral' standards—unlike commercial ones—change whenever edu-
cation and religion are brought to bear upon a people; and that these levers have
been used Punch may or may not believe. Ill does it become a moralist to preach
of sin and crime when he is guilty of charging a people of crimes which are as un-
founded as they are mean, and which he knows to be so. I had always thought
that the first principle in journalism was truthfulness, but Punch seems to consider
its antipodes the primary qualification, at least so far as the Black Country is con-
cerned. He has, in his character of satirist, stooped from his proper sphere to
attack an industrious people, who, it may be as well to say, take their distinctive
title, not from their social, moral, or spiritual darkness—in the latter of which
Afr. Punch seems to be deeply dyed, or he would have, at least, a drop of the “milk
of human kindness”—but from the nature of their employment, and the appearance
of the country. Surely there can be no reproach in this.
“However much Mr. Punch may ignore the true state of the Black Country
people, it is certain intelligent men will never believe that Staffordshire Englishmen
are more savage, more brutal, more ignorant, and more beastly than the poor
aborigines of New Zealand.”
Mr. Punch would be but too glad if, like Rip Van Winkle, he could
fall asleep, not over the Black Country only, but over every manufac-
turing district of England, to wake, in fifty §. and find education
for ignorance, thrift and comfort for improvidence and squalor, gentle-
mess and refinement for coarseness and brutality, in man and woman-
kind: health and happiness, rosy cheeks and childish glee, for sickli-
ness and suffering, stunted body and pallid cheek, decrepitude of
body, and deadening of mind–bitter fruits of premature and unwhole-
some toil—among children. We say it with deep conviction, and with
a shame of which we are quite ready to take our full share, that there
is to be found, in those sad reports, on one of which our lines were
founded, such a picture of English labouring life, not in the Black
Country only, but in the lace-making and straw-plaiting, the cotton
and silk-weaving districts, among the seamstresses and milliners of
London, and the miners of Durham and Cornwall, as should make all
#. hearts heavy, and all English faces hot with remorse and shame.
If there were no Nemesis for such things, there would be no beneficent
Power to guide the universe, and mete out to men a just measure of
Consequences.
Where the blackness is so wide spread, it may be that Mr. Punch
has been unjust in singling out any one spot in the sable waste. God
knows, it would not have been hard, to widen the application of his
lines, and to insist on what he blushes to believe, that there is no
industrial district of England but calls more urgently for real Christian-
ising influences than New Zealand, or any outlandish Missionary
station in the world.
The savagery at home is sadder than the savagery, over sea, be-
çause it is savagery in the bosom of a so-called Christian land; because
it is savagery at the elbow of civilisation; because it is ignorance, pri-
Yation, childish over-toil, premature death, side by side with culture,
luxury, and pampered enjoyment. Worse still, because our home.
º: are savages of our making—savages bred of our unhallowed
greed of gold; the prolétariat swarmed by a sordid system that dealt
with human beings as hands, and ignored heads and hearts alike, for
generations.
* See the Number for December 15, 1866.
They
We never said, or meant to say, that things were as bad in the
Black Country now as they were fifty, forty, or twenty years ago....We
are quite ready to believe, with a more courteous and kindly Black
Country correspondent than MR. Lawley, that much has been done,
and that much is doing, for religion, education, and civilisation in that
region as everywhere else. We not need this correspondent’s
assurance of the fact; but we are glad to put on record what he tells
us of Tipton :-
“A Parish three and a half miles long by two and a half miles wide. Population
about 30,000, and containing over thirty churches and chapels, to all of which
Sunday Schools are attached, and Day Schools to many (one of which I know to
have an average attendance of over 300), all this does not look like New Zealand
aborigines. Statistics of crime smaller than in agricultural districts. Pray do not
libel us by confounding the blackness of ignorance with the necessary blackness of
occupation—an occupation very essential to England's greatness.”
Yes, the working up of coal and iron is “very essential to England's
greatness,” no doubt; but not so essential as the working up of human
hearts, now blacker than coal and harder than iron, into the beauty
and ºnath and shapeliness of an instructed and well-ordered
people.
If Mr. Punch has been unfair to the Black Country, he has, at least,
been sinning in f. company. Hear what MR. Justice KEATING
spoke from the Bench, in a Black Country case, not three weeks
ago:—
“At the Stafford assizes the chief witnesses in a case were two young girls
about fourteen years old, who are employed in canal boats. In cross-examination
they both said they could neither read nor write; they had never been at school,
church, or chapel, and they had never heard of the Bible. MR. Justice KEATING,
in his summing up to the Jury, thus remarked upon the subject—‘I cannot help
noticing the most º: state of matters shown by the evidence of these girls.
We ourselves a Christian people, and pride ourselves upon being a civilised
nation. These two girls have said that they could neither read nor write; that they
had never in their lives been at school, church, or chapel; that they had never
heard of the Bible; and, as the learned counsel had suggested, in all probability
they had never heard of a divine Being. We send out missionaries to the heathen, but
what avails all this when we see such a state of things at home f"
Mr. Punch echoes the learned Judge, in the last of those very lines
of his which have given such offence to MR, LAwLEY, and asks again,
“What's the savage o'er sea, to the savage at home f"
THE “SPECIALS’” PROCLAMATION:
OR, Two WRONGS MAKE ONE RIGHT.
We have hitherto believed this logical contradiction to be beyond
the possibility of any other solution; but we live in strange times,
which produce results of a like character. . The proclamation below

chester and Clerkenwell) and when read separately there can be but
little doubt about there being two outrageous “Wrongs; ” but let

IDEA
A MOST UNSEASONABLE IDEA.
Did you not shudder, my dear Mr. Panch, when you read CAPTAIN
SHERARD Osborn's letter in the Times, advocating a voyage of Arctic
discovery at this time of the year? The thermometer is now down
below the freezing-point. I am sitting near a fire, but can hardly
write, my fingers are so benumbed. The cold in England is more than
intense enough. I am much too far North to think, without horror of
oing any farther in that direction now. At present I should suppose
that, if anybody entertained an idea of an ºf expedition, he
would rather contemplate researches in the interior of Africa. I should
very much prefer the Equator to the North Pole for myself.
If this were Midsummer now, instead of Christmas-time, and if it
were blazing hot instead of bitterly cold, I could understand a man's
wishing to be afloat in the Polar sea, if not ice-bound. When ice is a
luxury, one feels a natural inclination to get into it. Now our feelings
prompt most of us to envy the inhabitants of the Torrid Zone. CAP-
TAIN SHERARD Osborn must be a man of very ardent temperament to
be capable of conceiving the suggestion that makes me shiver. That
isit. He is fired with the professional enthusiasm of a British Naval
Officer, who wants something to do. Perhaps that would suffice to
keep him warm at zero. He can be actuated by ºf else but mere
geographical curiosity. Sir, however, I respect that. I am no Philis-
time, although I confess myself A SybARITE.
Warming-Pan Willa. New Year's Eve.
A GOOD WORD FOR A GOOD WORK.
MR. GROVE, the zealous secretary of the Palestine explorers, com-
g. that funds are not forthcoming for their interesting work.
pecially he murmurs that the Clergy are not liberal in subscribing,
to which the Clergy—at least, some of them—may possibly reply that,
while so many a Fº Curate is wanting help in England, they can
hardly be expected to send money to Jerusalem. Still, the parsons
might subscribe a sermon to the fund. The exploration of the Holy
Land is surely a fit theme for comment from the pulpit, and a collec-
tion for the fund might follow the discourse. Further small sub-
scriptions might be fittingly obtained, if every diner-out this Christmas
would but kindly give a guinea to the Palestine explorers after every
occasion of his swallowing a Fº of Palestine soup. All who do
so may be sure that the fund which they are helping will be wisely
and well spent. MR.G.Rove has well explained the object and the
benefit of the work he has in hand, and every one who knows him will
; if need be, that he assuredly is not one of the GRove of
arney.
BRITANNIA DOING PENANCE IN HER BALANCE
SHEET.
SAID PUNCH to BRITANNIA, gloomily brooding -
Q'er her balance-sheet squared, for the twelvemonth just past,
“Why that frown, dear Mamma, on your forehead intruding,
That sigh, up and down as sum-totals you cast?
“True, a few hundred thousand Excise may have dwindled,
Nor does Income-Tax show so plethoric a purse;
But still, for a year, when finance has so swindled,
And credit collapsed so, things might have been worse.
“There’s the “Customs, you see, show a rise on the quarter,
And the ‘Post Office, still, has a surplus in store;
‘Miscellaneous Returns' aren't perceptibly shorter,
And “Stamps’ might have º fallen off more.
“Then cheer up, old Lady; Threadneedle Street owns
o cause for thus clouding your new-year felicity,”–
But the Old Lady will not cheer up, only groans,— - -
“What are “Customs” and “Stamps’ to my lost elasticity!
“Time was that my income kept swelling and swelling,
As if 'twas the law of its nature to swell
Without docking taxes, or outward propelling
Of trade, still each year the same tale used to tell.
“Still I bought more and sold more, ate heartier, felt stronger,
And found every year more I’d spent and more made:
But that's at an º 'm elastic no longer;
No, ‘go’ in my commerce, no tide in my trade.
“My business is on its beam-ends for the present,
And harm done that can’t be so easy repaired,
For what with financing and making things pleasant,
My credit I’ve crippled, and capital scared.
“Qh, had I but stuck to hard toil and fair trading,
Not taken to paper and kite-flying º
For advances in cash looked to good bills of lading,
Not to “pig-upon-bacon” straw-men and their names!
“Had I ticked rogues as rogues, branded swindlers as swindlers,
Nor at rascaldom winked, if for millions it threw,
My commerce and credit had not both been dwindlers,
My balance-sheet minus, my look-ahead blue.
“For my turkey and chine I had still felt inclined,
Nor to the sad fact given shameful publicity,
That poor old BRITANNIA is knocked out of wind,
Out of credit, and commerce, and—worse-elasticity 1"
* City slang for accommodation bills, in which A draws on himself under differ-
ent names, right hand on left, and vice versii.
GETTING ON BY DEGREES.
It appears that, annually, about thirty-six thousand Tramps pervade
England, and are good enough to patronise the Union Hotels esta-
blished by the rate-payers. But there be Tramps and Tramps. There
are lazy rascals who like a lounging life, and are content to eat dirty
bread; that is, bread that is not earned. There are honest fellows who
are obliged to wander in search of work, and who deserve to be º;
on their way. Some of the counties—fifteen, we read in the Standard
—have devised a Test, and it seems to work reasonably well. Honest
Tramp, when leaving a Union, must take a ticket, appointing him his
next halt, which is a good way off, and when he gets there, he must do
a good bit ºf work." Then he receives reliefon what is called the first
Class Scale, sufficing food, decent bed. Rascal Tramp, who neglects
these formalities, is relieved on the Second Class Scale, which can by
no means be called luxury. These are prosy details, but Mr. Punch is
so pleased to see any exemplification of Brains in relation to the treat-
ment of the poor, that he gives himself leave to note the facts, adding
that, according to the reports, many of the Tramps who can't take a
First Class, become Wranglers.
A Very Ill Bird.
M. Thiers, in his war-speech, protested against defensive war. He
said, “A defensive war begins when one has been unfortunate. I add
that it is little in accordance with our national character.”
Which, then, must be Offensive. -
The deduction is M. Thiens's, not ours. We adore French persons,

A NEW HUMANE SOCIETY.
THE Reform Bill being passed, there is properly a cry for extending
education among the poorer classes, that they may become worthy to
be trusted with a vote. But in order to be educated, children must be
fed, for brains grow weak and useless unhelped by bread and meat;
Our ragged schools do wonders in their teaching of poor children, and
would do greater wonders still if the children were well fed. A child
that hungers after knowledge can, however, hardly pay attention to his
lessons, supposing he be also craving after food. So a new Humane
Society has sensibly been formed for the purpose of providing weekly
dinners for poor children, whose—
“Almost constant destitution of food is not only laying the foundation of per-
manent disease in their debilitated constitutions, but reduces them to so low a
state, that they have not vigour of body or energy of mind sufficient to derive any
profit from the exertions of their teachers.”
This new Humane Society is conducted by LoRD SHAFTESBURY and
a dozen other gentlemen, whose names, afford a guarantee that what
#: #.*: be well done. What they have already done is modestly
us stated:-
* Experience has proved that one substantia meat dinner per week has a
marked effect on the health and powers of the children. Such a meal may be sup-
plied with facility, and with little danger of abuse, in or near their school-room,
under the management of the teachers and local committees. Fifteen thousand
good solid dinners have been supplied in Westminster and Chelsea by means of this
society at a cost of four-pence per dinner, all expenses included, of which one penny
#: º to a rule of the society, been paid by each child before obtaining a
inner ticket.”
Among the middle classes, and the upper too, perhaps, children as
a rule have too much to eat, at Christmas, and the same thing may be
said, of many an “old boy” who is a constant diner-out. In their
plethora, º: hardly will much pity the poor little ones, whose appe-
tites are rarely blest with dinners made to match. An Alderman who
never has been hungry in his life can scarcely have much sympathy for
people who are starving, because hunger is to him an agreeable sensa-
tion, forerunning a luxurious and copious repast. Still, Christmas is
a season when the organ of benevolence is usually in tune, and the
Poor Dinners Society is surely a fit theme on which an overture of
purse-strings may be founded or proposed. If all who over-eat, or
over-drink themselves this Christmas will but fine themselves five
shillings in their next morning's repentance, and forward them to
MEssie URs RANsom, Bankers, Pall Mall East, many a little ragged
scholar will get a Christmas dimer, and be all the wiser, and the
healthier, and happier for having the good meal.
“BENE WALE, OCULE MI.”
AN accident to a prime face is not, primdº facie, a thing to joke about.
But Mr. Punch is so resolved to congratulate MR. GLApstone on his
escape from a serious disaster, that the compliment shall come in any-
how. He was watching a woodman who was not sparing that tree at
Hawarden Castle, and was no doubt saying to himself that he would
take an early opportunity of taking a chop like that at the present
Democratic Cabinet, when a bit of Bark flew at him-just as if Dizzy
had been answering him. We rejoice to learn that his eye, which was
struck, is not likely to be permanently injured. He can see more with
one eye than most men with two, but we shall want him for PREMIER,
some of these days, with all his faculties about him, and not as monops
inter cacos.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FEW FRIENDS.
(FROM MY PHOTOGRAPH BOOK.)
TABLEAU XII. —MY PORTABLE FRIEND.
My Portable Friend is a dodger: an artful dodger. Not in a bad
sense ; far from it: he wishes to benefit his fellow-creatures—specially
his travelling fellow-creatures. - -
Being, therefore, about to leave England (without my Late Friend),
I call on Sey MoUR, the Portable.
I’ve got so accustomed to designate him as the Portable, that it
does not occur to me until I see the word on paper, that few people,
except his immediate friends, will understand my meaning.
Well, everything with him is comparatively valueless unless it is
somehow or other a dodge, a portable dodge.
His hat, for instance, would be unworthy to bear the name of my
Portable Friend, unless it was capable of being turned into a cloak, a
warming-pan, an umbrella, or something equally startling, unexpected,
and, in his opinion, “the most useful thing possible.”
I will just premise that, Head Quarters having sent to say they
wanted my attendance in London for some extra duty under the
Olfactory Inspection Act, I was obliged to put off º departure from
º until winter. Having said this much, I call on my Portable
riend.
I find him (it is winter) wrapped up in a variegated dressing-gown,
and seated before the fire.
In front of him is a large glass cylinder on brass legs. By means of
a handle he is turning this cylinder round and round slowly, eyeing its
revolutions with an air of solemn, melancholy interest, his general
appearance conveying the notion of a man testing the powers of a
barrel-organ by its performance of the Dead March in Saul, or of a
deaf gentleman under the impression that he is eliciting beautiful
sounds from the instrument at hand. - - -
“How d'ye do? Sit down,” says he, without rising, or leaving off
his grinding. -
Not liking to disturb him, I take a seat, and watch his proceedings
with some interest. If this were a private room in Hanwell, the per-
formance would be an easier one to understand.
I say I take a seat—I should say the seat takes me, for no sooner do
I attempt to place myself comfortably upon it, than its arms and legs
suddenly join, seize me in a sort of embrace, and down I come on the
flo
Portable Friend, “that’s a good dodge, isn't it?
or.
“Ah!” says Å.
that’s my sofa walking-stick, only it’s a little out of order now. Take
any other. No, not that,” seeing me about to take a very easy-looking
chair with a large back; “that’s what I call my “bath chair, and if
you sit on the centre button—exactly on the centre, mind,--it opens
out into a large bath, and the water flows in from the back. The back
is a tank.”
Having escaped Scylla after my fall into Charybdis, I settle myself
On a j where, as the conjurors say, there can be no deception.
Presently crack, crack, crack, noises from somewhere like bon-bons
being pulled. Thinking it the camp-stool, I jump up.
I am reassured by my Portable Friend, who tells me he has been
.."; this result for the last two hours. It appears that the noises
proceed from the glass barrel he is turning. , Apparently satisfied, he
commences putting away this infernal machine (nothing less appa-
He goes on to tell me that he is having a galvanic portmanteau fitted
º which is, from his account, to do everything except pay the expenses
of a journey. It will mark the time, the distance, §º the day of the
month, cook a dinner, be a bed, a carriage, a boat; º he has
even some idea of making it a horse. On occasion, with a little
extra galvanism, it may be made to bark like a dog, or some other feat
equally useful.
“So you’re

(Communicated to our own Circle by DANDo, the Oyster-
Eater.)
A MEssage from the Spirit-sphere,
List, ye who linger yet behind;
I found not any oysters here,
Which did at first disturb my mind.
The natives that I loved so well,
At Colchester which had their birth,
When in these climes I came to dwell,
At first oft drew me back to earth.
And oh, regretfully I cried, -
Would I were in the world again,
To tuck into my dear inside ..
Those sweet molluscs as I did then
But Spirits that have newly come
Where all of you will have to go,
Inform me what is now the sum
A dozen oysters cost below.
True, that would have been nought to me,
was in my mortal day,
But now it is not right, I see,
To eat your fill, and then not pay.
To point a moral is the care
Of all us disembodied souls;
Your oysters fail you. Now beware,
Says DANDo, how you waste your coals.

might have managed them better.

THE STAGE AND ST. STEPHEN’S.
The following mottoes for Ministers, &c., will be found, on examina-
tion, more applicable than they appear at the first blush:-
The EARL of DERRY.-The Game of Speculation. There is much
fitness in this. The noble Earl's premiership will be distinguished by
the º: of a measure which (quoting Punch) he has himself termed
“A leap in the dark.”
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER.—A Winning Card. . Though
we thought he had a bad hand, BENJAMIN kept his great card till the
last, and there is no question about its being a winning one. He
might have played it fairly when he ought to have done, though.
LoRD STANLEY.-Perfection. This, of course, must be true, when
both friends and foes are trumpeting his praises.
MR. GATHoRNE HARDY.—The School for Tigers. Amply proved by
his treatment of FINLEN and his companions, and the treatment he is
prepared to give others of a like calibre.
MR. WALPole.—Kind to a Fault. Even his worst enemy will say
this of our poor male Niobe.
LoRD JoHN MANNERs.-Caste. The extreme propriety of this motto
will º: be denied when we remember that the noble Lord, once
Wrote :-
“Let laws and learning, arts and commerce die,
But leave us still our old nobility.”
SIR John PAKINGTON.—We had some thoughts of writing He’s a
Lunatic, but beg to substitute Still Waters run Deep, having especial
reference to the attachment SIR John has always borne to Household
...; but which he never allowed to bubble up to the surface until
recently. -
SIR STAFFORD NORTHCOTE. Allow me to Erplain. The Right Hon.
Gentleman, it will have been observed, is particularly anxious that his
proper share in the “Reform Bill” should be distinctly understood,
and consequently he is always asking to be allowed to explain. Hi
proper position, however, stated briefly, is this :—that at the com-
mencement of last Session he vowed he could never consent to House-
hold *. whilst at its close he was a member of the Cabinet which
passed it.
MR. WHALLEY.-Man is not Perfect nor Woman neither. The former
is sometimes along way from it. N.B. Note the present instance.
The Adullamites.—A Little Flirtation, illustrating their position with
the present Government.
The Tory party.—The School of Reform. . We say nothing respecting
this, , as the Schoolmaster recently said enough respecting it at
Edinburgh.
FUSTIAN FROM FRANCE.
AMong other manufactures our neighbours, the French, are cer-
tainly rivalling us in fustian. A specimen of this article was exposed
the other day in a column of the Times. Its producers were French
democrats, who addressing their British brethren on the subject of the
Manchester martyrs to murder and treason, said, amongst other things
altogether untrue:-
“Ces trois hommes ont ét condamnés, non pour avoir tué deux chevaux et un
agent de police Ils ont été condamnés pour avoir délivré a leurs risques et périls
deux chefs patriotes, le Colon EL KELLY et le CAPITAINE DEAsy, revenus d’Amérique
au secours de l'Irlande et pensant qu'après avoir affranchi les noirs, il était juste
d'affranchirles blancs.”
Fellows who assert that negro slaves and Irishmen are as black and
white would be perfectly ready to declare the former colour the latter.
They call DEAsy and KELLY two patriots. What would they think of
prisoners in custody on the charge of freeing a gentleman of his watch
and chain, and would they approve of shooting a constable in order to
rescue them —
“These three men have been condemned not for killing two horses and a
policeman.”
Horses first; policeman afterwards. This looks like supreme.con-
tempt for policemen; but what M. PYAT and his associates more likely
feelis fear of them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVART.
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
HIS Evening is
passed a consi-
derable way from
home; at the Am-
bigu Theatre, Pa-
ris. The Theatre
is very full, the
Second Act is just
about to commence
as we take our
seats in the fau-
teuils d'orchestre.
Behind us sit two
gyoung Englishmen,
who, having mis-
taken the charac-
ter of the place,
appear in full e-
vening dress, with
white ties and
gloves, and are
generally supposed
by their French
neighbours to

1st English Swell (with a sense of his mistake). The people never dress
here. I notice. - -
His Friend. No. (Looks round about him.) But what queer sort of
people to be in the Stalls.
[On his left is a very fat Frenchman, who appears to have put %
washing till to-morrow morning on account of the intensely co
weather. Behind him are three middle-aged, good-tempered look-
iny females, evidently bent on a holiday amusement.)
Woman (with basket of oranges, apples, and sweet-stuffs, enters the row
where they are sitting). Messieurs, (in a shrill, nasal tone) des oranges,
&c., pardon, M'sieu. [He has to rise to let her pass.
lst English Swell (taken aback). Hang it, we haven't made a mis-
take, eh? Fancy allowing this sort of thing in the Stalls!

Pantomime time, indulging in apples, oranges, and ginger beer,
and becomes j;
His Friend (suddenly inspired). Ah, I see, this is a sort of Transpon-
tine Theatre (looks at his Friend). We oughtn't to have dressed.
Three raps are heard, the Theatre is re-filled, the orchestra com-
mences, and the curtain rises upon the Second Act of
LES CHEWALIERS DU BROUILLARD.
ScENE-A Carpenter’s Workshop.

Boy (sharply, and in a very high pitched tone). La pièce? Ouim'sieu.
Cinquantecentimes (all in one word).
Friend (takes Book, pays, and looks proudly at his Friend, as much as
to say “See chat it is to speak the language”). There!
1st English Sicell (reading the cast). Hallo! do you know what it
is we’re seeing, eh?
His Friend sorry to be obliged to own it after his recent triumph of
language). No.

His Friend (explains, and adds). It’s all in HARRIson AINsworth's
story... (Having made this statement, he begins to feel uncertain on the
subject.) At least, I think so.

TAMiss (THAMEs). DARREL, and the rest of the characters.
Jack (after, in a fit of jealousy, trying to stab Tamise, and being forgiven
by Tanise and Cecily Wood, says to her). Wous étes bonne missil
Audience (breathing again after the excitement). Ah!

thing immensely. (Looks at the Entr'acte). By the way, what’s the

His Friend (who knows all about it). Oh, it means, the Chevaliers—
the Cavaliers--the Cavaliers—(is satiſed so far)
1st English Swell, Yes. Du “of the”—
His Friend. Yes, of the—um—of the in fact—of the Brouillard.
It's hardly translatable. (His Friend is satisfied. At the end of the
4c., however, he goes into a corner, refers to a small pocket dictionary, and
looks out" Brouillard” hurriedly. On his return he says carelessly),
Qh, by the way, I’ve thought of what Brouillard means: it’s a sort of
slangphrase; it means literally, “waste-paper basket.”
lsº Raglish Swell (prepared not to be astonished at anything French).
Qh, I see perfectly. (Translates) Les Chevaliers du Brouillard. “The
Cavaliers of the Yº: basket.”

meaning, when a Friend meeting them, suggests that they appear
to be completely mystifted on the subject.

gets out of the window on the right, and then Monsieur Wood
exits by the door, followed by the Policemen of the period.
Entr'acte. Newspaper cries, oranges, apples, sweet-stuffs, ereunt
more than half the audience. We enter the Theatre café, and
“command” an echoppe of beer.
Enter ALPHoNSE, a Friend of the Garçon's.
The Garçon (assisting Alphonse to allumettes for his cigarette). Com-
ment aimez-vous la pièceſ?
Alphonse (ecstatically). Magnifique ! MARIE LAURENT est . . .
[Is overcome by emotion, and raises his eyes and hand to heaven. The
Sonnette is heard. We return. After a view of the Tower %
London at Greenwich, we are shown the Thieves' Quarter in Old
London. (Some confusion apparently with Alsatia.) Enter all
the Chevaliers du Brouillard with lanterns and flags. Then
follow Dancers and Danseuses. We are rather astonished at
this display of the Thieves in the open street, but become per-
jectly reconciled to the manners and customs of this class in
George the FIRST's time on seeing Monsieur SHACK SHEP-
PAR enter on horseback.
Tous (avec les trois cris anglais). Hup! Hup! Hup ! hurray!
Swell (astonished for once). Why they say hooray!
His Friend (erplaining). Yes, it's supposed to be the national custom.

of acknowledging the salutation. Then descends. The dancing
commences.

His Friend. Yes. It’s—(suddenly hits upon it)—why, it’s the Nigger

as “from the principal London theatres.” Between the Acts Irish
jigs are played. Swell and his Friend nudge one another, and
try to look as if they’d never heard them before.

these fellows don't dress to come to a theatre.
His Friend. Oh I dare, say they’re only a better class of Shop-

Hup, Hup, Hooray,” and the Orchestra play “God Save the Queen.”
MRS. GLASSE ON EDUCATION.
YoU have read my book? and º remember my preliminary precept,
“First catch your hare f * Well, my directions are quite as applicable
to the head as to the hare. Education sets one, trap, employment
another; but a knowledge-box is not baited with toasted cheese, and
how to tempt a hungry little bumpkin to put his head into it, would
puzzle a Chancellor.
Having caught your hare by hook or by crook, now as to dressin
it. Some esteemed friends will recommend for this *. a professe
cook, sincerely believing that unless the cook is well dressed—say, in
lawn-sleeves, and a silk apron—the hare cannot be. Some zealous
advisers will insist that what you require is a plain cook, and will
perhaps refuse an invitation to dine if#. engage a chef whose thoughts
run in a jelly-mould, and who has a discriminating taste for syllabubs
and trifles. What do I advise? Well, I don't pretend to lead you
out of this dense mist. Your own good sense must be your ºf
star. Only take care lest while the cooks are chattering in the hall,
your hare, suspended in the pantry, should become a little too gamey.
Whose sauce do I recommend ? Reading, of course. It makes a
“full man.” With respect to Puddings, it has been suggested that
the Cabinet might be improved by putting Punch in it. No doubt
Punch would give the Cabinet a very rich flavour, but then you must
bear in mind that the Cabinet don't agree with every one, although
Punch does. I have, taken, it myself regularly for five-and-twenty
years, and can say with confidence that there is nothing which contains
so much pure spirit, or gives so much comfort and support to the
constitution. -
Bacon is nourishing, but rather difficult to digest, and should be
taken º by those who suffer from mental dyspepsia. You
should go to Milton if you wish to astonish the natives.
An important branch of education is that which relates to the know-
ledge of tongues. In WALPOLE's time, as you have read, a brisk trade
was carried on in tongues. Ministers went into the Borough Market
and bought them—some, I believe, with a bit of riband. Whether
this practice prevails now, I have no means of ascertaining—have you?
Many tongues which out of doors are distinguished by a strong
flavour—so strong, indeed, as to, be unpleasant—become very mild
when brought into the House. They also lose a good deal in weight,
and this will apply to those which are smoked in Town as well as to
those which are sent up from the country. An excellent way to pre-
serve a mild tongue is to hang it up in an office—the higher the better.
—Conversations on Economy, Domestic and Political.
“Very Good Taste, Mr. Punch.”
F HER MAJESTY, by the advice of MR. ARTHUR HELPs, has published
a Diary which would, were such a thing possible, endear her still more
to the loving hearts of her people. Praise, even from Mr. Punch, were
an impertinence, but he begs leave to say with his usual adroitness,
that MR. HELPs's advice was admirable, and that Mr. Punch hopes the
| fines which he incurs.
QUEEN may always have such Friends in Council.
SEWEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THIEWES.
BEFORE we pay our Christmas bills, it might be wise in us to ascer-
tain if any of our tradespeople are included among those referred to in
this notice of the Pall Mall Gazette –
“An easy and safe method of making money in trade appears to be offered by the
use of unjust weights, scales, and measures. During the past year 740 South
London shopkeepers have been convicted of that offence—and have had to pay in
fines Él,070 15s. 5d., or rather less than £1 9s. per conviction. The general preva-
lence of the practice and the lightness of the fines imposed make the speculation a
good one-especially as in many districts there is no supervision of any kind exer-
cised over the retail dealers, and as in all districts the supervision exercised is
superficial and perfunctory. For every dealer who is fined, there must be scores
who deserve to be fined, and who would be fined were the supervision exercised
active and real.”
The Forty Thieves were few, and their thievery a mere fleabite, com-
º: to the rascality of these Seven Hundred and Forty Thieves. The
qrty. Thieves robbed only those who could afford to lose, and they
robbed openly and boldly, and at the risk of being hanged. But these
infamous South London Seven Hundred and Forty. Thieves have been
robbing the poor, probably, more even than the rich, and have been
thieving secretly and sneakingly, at no risk to their necks, merely
paying a small fine if they have chanced to be found out. To a small
tradesman who chooses to act as a big rogue, a fine of nine and twenty
shillings is, nothing of a punishment, j never will deter him from
cheating all he can. We can fancy him, indeed, keeping an account
of the profits of his roguery, as an insurance fund for payment of the
The pillory of old was a more sufficing punish-
ment, for except by honest dealing, no one could insure
against the inconvenience of standing to be pelted with dead cats and
rotten eggs. But the present age is too refined to suffer such a º:
as a rascal in the pillory, and the only way to punish him is to have his
name exposed in the pillory of the Press. Of every cheating trades-
man convicted of the usage of false measures, or short weights, the
name and the address should be advertised in the newspapers, and
placarded conspicuously in the neighbourhood of his shop. But the
present is an age of universal easy whitewash, and, when gigantic rail-
way swindlers are allowed to go unpunished for using false accounts
one really can scarce wonder that petty cheating shopkeepers should
expect to escape punishment for having used false weights.
A RELIC OF THE OPERA.
“By Jove, I’ll write a puff of SANTLEY!” said Mr. Punch, as he
heard that artist conclude his capital Rendering of a capital song
(words by MR. LATEY, music by MR. SMART) at the Monday Concerts.
He forswore himself, however, only as there is no such party as Jove
now, the sin does not perturb him. The reason was this. He found
on his desk, through the kindness of some correspondent or other,
four printed verses in honour of MR. SANTLEY, and they appear to him
to be so remarkable that he inclines to give them to his readers, instead
of a lyric of his own. They were written before the fire at the Opera
House, and it is a mercy they were not consumed in it. Now, they are
imperishable:—
SANTLEY.
Oh! sing, my good friend, jovial SANTLEy,
With voice sympathetic and clear,
The homage to artistes most grateful
We'll give you, a smile, and a tear.
I'll think of thee always with pleasure,
What style, so expressive, and fine,
So heart-touching, feeling, and tender,
Here's thy health in a bumper of wine.
Let us to Her Majesty's go, friends,
This night glorious SANTLEY to see.
Besides there's the gem, charming TIETJENs,
DE MERIC, and rare MonuinFE.
For when Fiorow's sweet Marta's perform'd,
The house then is glorious to see.
And when TIETJENs sings charming “Ardſta,”
The applause is both frantic and free.
There ! MR. SANTLEY should be proud, Mr. Punch is proud, and
the author, whoever he be, must be proudest of all. -
But this shall not prevent Mr. Punch saying that he hugely admires
MR. SANTLEY.

will still be some extra
nights, under the patro-

chore, M. Momus, and others of the more light-hearted deities,
before we go back to school, and work, and getting up early in the
morning, and the worship of Plutus and Mammon, and the more busi-
ness-like divinities. But the lawful period during which anybody, even
a dun, may salute you with “A merry, &c., and a happy, &c. has
ceased with the last stroke of twelve, by Big Ben;, and they are all
this moment gone—I have just º: them to the door—Old Father
Christmas, and the Lord of Misrule, and the Abbot of Unreason, and
Saint George of Cappadocia, and the Mummers, and the Wassailers,
the Fairies and the Goblins, the Waits and the Hand-bells, and, the
Twelfth-Night characters in their masquerade dresses, leaving me alone
with Clown and Columbine, who are to remain for a few weeks º:
on board-wages. There is a crossing-sweeper in Russell Square who
will wish me a happy new year till about the middle of February, and
from whom I can at any time obtain a very warm benediction by the
expenditure of a penny, but with this exception I feel that I am, safe
from the compliments of the season until another December, and am
relieved by thinking that the other festivals of the Church recur unac-
companied by any formulary of politeness, and that there is no prece-
dent for my laundress wishing me.“A Merry Easter and a Happy
New Whitsuntide.”
I am not one of the popular writers of the day, and there is a
reason why I am reconciled to the absence of that distinction—I
escape being invited, in the calm, sentimental autumn, when holidays
are realities, and work seems more than ever the badge of a fallen
state, to dash of a story (a ghost preferred), or a dream, or a poem, or
a double acrostic for Christmas numbers and Christmas annuals. And
as everything has been said about Christmas and the New Year. that
can be said, from the meaning of the word Yule and the antiquity of
lum-pudding to the exact number of tons of mistletoe supplied for the
ondon market, and the statistics of Lincolnshire geese and Norfolk
turkeys; and as I have never spent Christmas Day, in a weighing-
machine, or a lighthouse, or a lunatic asylum, or a coal-mine, or on an
uninhabited island in the South Pacific, or even in a London tavern;
and as I never had an interview with a ghost, and possess no family
tradition of a white bird that flutters against the window-panes in a
storm of wind and rain whenever the head of the family is going to
die; and cannot speak from personal experience of the domestic habits
of fairies; and was never in a baronial hall in my life, except under
charge of a housekeeper, to whom I had to º: a fee; and do not even
know what joint or joints a baron of beef represents; and did not
become engaged to my wife in consequence of a chance encounter
under the Druidical parasite in an old-fashioned country-house in
Nottinghamshire; and have never been reconciled to a rich but unrea-
sonable uncle, softened by boiled turkey, plum-pudding with blue
lights, and respectable port wine, in Upper Bedford Place, I feel
that my contribution to the literature of the season would be thin and
vapid, and am content to be obscure and unsought, the question of
compensation always excepted.
I can imagine that there are those who really find their Christmas
merry, and commence their New Year hº MANSFIELD WooD-
- ird week in December,
received a letter from a highly respectable firm of country solicitors,
announcing a legacy of ten thousand pounds left him by an elderl
gentleman, a stranger in blood, whom he had once helped throug
a growd at a...contested election; Norton Disney, who arrived
Xith his beautiful bride from a foreign tour of long duration, on
Christmas Eve, at the family mansion, built in the jacobean style in
a well-timbered park, amid the greetings of an hereditary and punctual
tenantry; my capital City #. KINgston Hull, who made, about a
fortnight ago, that lucky speculation in inseed, by which he cleared
more money than I shall amass all my life long; the young lady, the
.# new Starr in the horizon of Art, who won the A. gold
medal for the best historical painting—the only one of her sex who has
so triumphed since SIR. Joshua first took snuff in the Presidential
chair; Holme PIERREPONT, who finished the last chapter of his tri-
volumed, novel, and brought the fortunes of Godfrey Sutton and Gwen
Ashburnham to a successful, and hymeneal termination, as the Waits
for the last time were waking up the better half of Captain Coram
Street—the most exquisite music Holme thought he had ever heard;
CLEFFE SHARP, who, not a month since, made another loud hit with
|his “Upper Ten”.Waltz and “Abyssinian”. Galop;-these, and a few
other, exceptional beings, can, I believe, give and take the customar
compliments with cordial sincerity, and brave the horrors of an Englis
Christmas with cheerful fortitude. But—but I will avoid any appear-
ance of cynicism (convivial parties to track this word to its source),
on an evening when the nine o'clock post has brought me something
very agreeable, particularly as I have this moment said farewell to the
whole of the Christmas bevy, whose voices I, can now hear dying
away in the distance; for, as CICERo said to the junior PLINY when
they were supping º: at the Three Taverns, a celebrated restaurant
of antiquity, being t ºf: public-houses rolled into one, and
|LYDIA, who was waiting, told them the news of NERO's death that
evening, from a surfeit of stewed º mulled metheglin, “De
mortuis nil nisi bonum.” So, as the “W of Life” has fairly rolled
into the New Year, I will set down one or two thoughts on 1868, in
part suggested by the revolutions of a lively instrument, which amused
|me to-night as much as it did CYBII, and DICK, ALICE and FAN, and a
great many more.
|, Will the Conservative droll i. jump clean through the Liberal
balloon?, Will the accomplished acrobat take another leap?' Shall
we see strange tricks transformations, wonderful surprises and
combinations? Will there be :*::: match the performance of
Tory Ministers º a Radical Reform Bill to the steps of the
Throne? Perhaps the Co of Physicians will announce their adhe-
sion to homoeopathy, or the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House will
turn pirates, and destroy all their Hº: and Beacons or the two
|Houses of Convocation will sanction the practice of Mormonism, by
the stipendiary clergy. Perhaps MR. BRIGHT will attend Her Majesty's
|Levee in a new Court suit, or MR. WHALLEY become a convert to the
|Romish faith, or DR. Pusey place himself at the head of Positivism in
England. Perhaps we may see the formation of a Happy Family
Ministry, with ARGYLL, and BRIGHT, and CAIRNs, and CRANBoRNE,
and STANLEY, and Lowe, and MILL, and PALMER, and BRUCE, and
ForsTER, and STANsfELD, and GRANT DUFF, and RAWLINson, and
all the best men, with GLADSTONE as Captain, manning the good old
ship Britannia for another long and prosperous voyage.
But I must remember that mine is only a crow-quill. Certain events
are sure to º before the wassail bowl is sent round again. About
the middle of February we shall be told that more Valentines have
passed through the General Post-office than in any previous year since
the invention of Love and Penny Postage, and the exact tonnage of
those inflammatory documents will probably be calculated. Several
new singers will be brought out at the Opera, the majority of whom
will not prove lº. rivals to PATTI, or LUCCA, or GARDONI, and
a new Opera may be expected the last five nights of the season. There
will be an exhibition of a musical salmon, or a mermaid, who can paint
in water-colours. In July the Wimbledon Meeting will be a greater
hit than ever. About August the newspapers will insert, letters on
some popular grievance or popular whim, the deleterious character of
London sausage, or the superiority of horse-flesh over the ordinary
sorts of animal food. As Winter approaches, that is to say about the
end of Summer, Illustrated Books will be announced for Christmas,
and Specimen Plates appear in shop windows, CRABBE's Seasons, or
Pope's Ancient Mariner, or GAY's Elegy in a Country Workhouse. Later
on there will be the usual signs of an unusually severe winter, the
hedges bright with unlimited hips, and haws, and flocks of wild geese
|flying over the Mansion House. An infallible cure will be discovered
for sea-sickness, several new methods of swindling will amuse the Town,
a fresh man will be found for the Letters of Junius–ToM PAINE, or
“Old Q.”—a priceless Titian will turn up in Houndsditch, ladies will
discontinue wearing bonnets, the Master of the Buckhounds will be
made Secretary for the Colonies, and the President of the Poor Law
Board go out to India as Governor-General, the streets of London
will remain as dangerous and dirty as ever, several persons will die at
the age of 100 or upwards, one of whom knew a man who knew
another man, who knew a third man, who knew one of the men who
smothered the young Princes in the Tower, Mr. Punch will hold his
usual Durbars, and immortality is tº. anybody who succeeds
in devising a new set of figures for the Quadrille, a feat only inferior to
the taking of the Quadrilateral.

PROBABLY THE NEXT ABSURDITY
IN LADIES’ WINTER COSTUMEs.
A FEW FRIENDS.
(FROM MY PHOTOGRAPH BOOK.)
TABLEAU XII.—MY PORTABLE FRIEND.—(CoNTINUED.)
“Now, I tell you what you should have for travelling in this
weather,” says my Portable Friend; and therewith he takes up what
appears to be a sort of travelling-cap, not unlike the smuggler's pattern
in a melodrama.
“A travelling-cap,” I say. -
“Yes,” he answers, “that’s one use of it; but you'd find it a little
heavy for that, until you’re accustomed to it. But you fill it with air,
and round the sides there’s a lining of india-rubber, so that the hot
water won't come through.”
“Hot water?” I exclaim. - -
“Yes,” he returns, apparently astonished at my interruption. “When
blown out it serves as a foot-warmer, don't you see? That’s a new
dodge, isn’t it?” - - -
I suggest that what between its being a travelling-cap and a foot-
warmer one wouldn't know whether one was standing on one's head or
one's heels... ... . . . - -
He doesn’t like joking on his favourite subjects, and says, seriously,
that if I don't want his advice he’ll talk about something else.
I assure him that I do want his advice, and tell him that the joke
was GRIGG’s, not mine; I had heard him say something of the sort
once, but I forget the occasion.
“Well,” he . on, still with this cap in his hand, “you want a
portable bath blow it out more and more, there you are!”
He produces a small pair of bellows, and, true enough, in less than
five minutes, “There,” as he says, “we are.”
“So far there’s nothing particularly dodgey about it,” he goes on.
“But now comes the triumph of art. By merely removing this screw
it becomes at once a waterproof coat, thus—”
He does something with a screw, and such a waterproof coat ensues'
You’d be hooted, in any capital in the world. I don't say this, but

MORIARTY'S MILK FOR BABES.

Has behaved like a gentleman—very;
The good Doctor, by name MoRIARTY,
Roman Catholic Bishop of Kerry,
He addresses his own priests, indeed,
But appears to be talking at others
Who have not the instruction they need
From his tacit episcopal brothers.
Information he gives them, which news
Would be reckoned amongst us by few men,
And by none who did ever peruse
Romish treatise for young catechumen.
In his letter he speaks, to their shame,
Simple truths of religion and reason,
Saying “Martyrdom isn't the name
Fit to give death for murder and treason.
“For a criminal's soul, beyond doubt,
'Tis in private all right to say masses;
But the State with your prayers to flout,
You’re no better than Catholic asses.
Not in triumph should requiems be sung
For the men to whom justice was meted.
If the deeds for which those men were hung
Were good deeds, they’d be rightly repeated.
“Who can be, than all those who complain
Of political hanging, absurder,
All the while when they will not abstain
From committing political murder?
They should shoot not who wish not to swing,
Keep their hands clean from assassination—
Due concession a short time will bring,
In these days, to all just agitation.’
Milk for babes above all things is good,
When as yet they can live but by suction;
Donkey's milk, as it were, is the food
For grown men who want children's instruction,
And such food MoRIARTY supplies
To the priests who’ve to feed lay believers.

“Yes, I do,” says he, triumphantly. “The lower part comes but
thus (he takes it out); these separate pieces of wood join together
like a fishing-rod—” --- - - -
“Yes,” I say, breathless with interest; for it's better than any trick
change in a pantomime. -- - - - -
“Yes,” he continues; “you fix it in this screw-hole, and there you
are at once, mast, sail, and boat...Then you cross the swollen torrent.”
“In Norway?” I say, meditatively.
“In Norway,” he answers, ºf -
“But,” I say, “I’m going to Paris, and perhaps to Zurich.”
“Equally useful,” he replies. “Travelling-cap, boat, waterproof
coat, ºvue: bottle, and sponge-bath, all in one: what can you want
more
“True,” I admit, “I don’t think any one could want any more.”
“I’m not quite sure if you couldn't use it as a portmanteau.”
Being prepared for anything, I ask, How?
“Well,” he says, scrutinising it carefully, “a false bottom would do
it. And then” (here he lights up as with the fire of inspiration) “by
Jove, it might be a bed; or, if you could only carry a set of wheels, all
inside one, it would make a car. I’ll call it the Wheels-within-wheels,
and take out a patent.” - - -
He is quite excited. The excitement is contagious. I actually find
myself assisting him to invent some additional advantages for what was
originally a travelling-cap, with a (so to speak) foot-warmer to follow.
It doesn't take us ten minutes to turn it (in theory) into a piano,
then to carry inside table and chairs, and finally, as far as I can follow
the intricacies of the invention, the entire furniture of a bed-room.
“. Look!” says my Portable Friend, enthusiastically; “There you
are independent of any one ! You don’t care what sort of a room you
get. Top story, attic, no furniture, out you come with your wheels-
within-wheels-travelling-cap” (he has already adopted the name) “there’s
the bed, out comes a screw; there's a wheel, take out the spokes,
there are the legs of your table, cover the top with this part (the sail)
there’s the top of the table, let out the water from the bottle sides into

tired of that—exhaust the air, and set it up as a bed; then go to sleep.
When once the thing’s in, working order, you 'd be independent
of everything and everybody, which is after all the great point in
travelling.” - - -
I think if it could be made into a free gratis railway and boat ticket
real independence would be obtained. -
“You ought to have one made at once,” is my Portable Friend's
advice to me.
I excuse myself on the ground that there won’t be time, but if he’d
tell me of some, simple, contrivance to secure a certain, amount of
comfort in travelling, I should be much obliged. By which I mean to
hint, “Let’s be practical, not portable.”

and do all sorts of things.
Will no good Guy FAUx

Terrace before something
worse happens?
They – they — excuse
our agitation, we shall be
better presently, we dare
apparently quite sober.
Pº. noble BEALEs addressed them :-
*The CHanamax said: My friends, I am happy to meet you again after the
recreation of the holidays, and trust that you are prepared to encounter the labours
of the present year in the same spirit of sound and sober patriotism and judgment,
and ºf. firmness, in what you believe to be right, as that which has hitherto
distinguished the proceedings of the Reform League."
No harm in that, you’ll say. Bumptious, perhaps, but BEALEs has
been awful bumptious ever since SIR ALEXANDER CockBURN turned
him into the cold. Well, he went on, made a very long speech, declaring
that the Reform Bill must be reformed, that all its Tory clauses must be
taken out, and that Irish difficulties must be adjusted “to the satisfac:
tion of the Irish.” Their Reform League has been suspended, out of
compliment to the suspension of the Habeas Corpus, and BEALEs
allows that this was right. Then he made a dreadful fuss because a
letter to him had been cut open somewhere. Of course, he said it was
done in the Post-Office, but there was not the least proof that it had
not been done for a lark by one of the League errand-lads who wanted
to rile his tempestuous patron. Finally, a resolution of Deep Sympathy
with Ireland was proposed.
Then the Bubblyjocks began to gobble:—
“MR. GUEDALLA said that nothing would ever satisfy the Irish people except a
national Parliament sitting in College Green. (Hear, hear!). He hoped the League
would soon help the Irish people to agitate for a repeal of the Union. They were
not to be carried away by this Fenian craze, and he hoped they would pass a resolu-
tion that they would help the Irish people to agitate for a repeal of the Union, and
let them wish God speed to the Parliament which would sit in College Green.
(Hear, hear !) . The Chairman spoke of “Fenianism run mad," but they had lately
seen loyalty ‘run mad.” (Hear, hear !). He was glad to see that a number of
working men had declined to be sworn in as special constables.”
An amendment breathing GUEDALLA sentiments was moved:—
“Mr. MUDGE said he saw no liberty in England at all but the liberty to do as
the powers like—the right to keep a lot of German cut-throats in the country."
MR. BEALES, M.A., who thinks it a hardship that he is not one of
* little judges, immediately rebuked this brutal insolence.
101 [10
“The CHAIRMAN said he would not pledge himself for or against the repeal of the
Union, but he thought the addition to the resolution was out of place.”
Those were MR. BEALes's sentiments. We don't blame his caution,
considering the ..ºf he got from his Bubblyjocks for having writte
something supposed to reflect on Fenianism, but we do think that .
might have hinted that “German cut-throats” was a little—eh? Never
* terrified by their name-
family, and have arepublic,
say. The Reform League Council met again after the holidays, and
mind. Then arose the terrible MR. FINLEN, bullyer of the Home
| Office, and as bould a speaker as if he had served an apprenticeship to
a Judge and Jury Club.
He wanted to speak, but the League did not exactly like his
bouldness:—
“MR. Cooper moved that MR. FINLEN be heard.
“MR. ACLAND moved that he be not heard. On the last occasion that MR.
FINLEN spoke in that room he concluded his speech with the words, “Success to
Fenianism.” Mr. FINLEN had been the greatest.enemy to the League. (“No, no /'
and "Hear, hear?') In fact, MR FINLEN's conduct had been most prejudicial and
dishonouring to the League. (“No º' and “Hear, hear!”)
“MR. Mudge knew no man who had done so much for Democracy as MR. FINLEN
had. (Hear, hear!) (A Voice, Mr. Punch's. “Such men are likely to do for it altogether.')
After some discussion the Chairman decided that MB. FINLEN was not a member
of the council, but that through courtesy they would hear him.
“MR. FINLEN said he would not address any observations upon the resolution
on sufferance, but he protested against the unmanly insinuations of MR. Acland.
(Hear, hear?) MR. AcLAND seemed to forget the course which he (MR FINLEN) had
adopted, viz.: that he acted altogether upon his own responsibility, (Hear, hear 1)
He had taken extreme views of subjects, and had been a thorough Republican-
(cheers)—in sympathy and persuasion for many years past.”
| These loyal gentlemen, having cheered the Republican, passed the
sympathy resolution, minus GUEDALLA's tag, and then got up the
great Odger. This is the tremendous shoemaker who threw MR.
GLADstone and MR. BRIGHT into such terror by announcing his
disapproval of their conduct., He now removes the QUEEN from
Ireland, unless the Irish should happen to wish to retain her.
“Mr. Opark then moved, and MR. HALEs seconded—“That this meeting is of
opinion that the Irish people should have an opportunity afforded them of voting
by manhood suffrage the kind of Government which they, as an intelligent people,
thinkwisest and best for the happiness and prosperity of their country.”
Thereupon, there was what, the reporter of the Morning Star (a
capital and fearless. reporter, by the way, who showed great spirit
when the League tried to dictate to him) calls, a warm discussion. At
length MR. CREMER º a way by which we can keep Ireland.
Hear it, DR. MANNING; hear it, DR.NEwMAN!—
*
“Mr. CREMER declared his belief that the Irish people did not want liberty. It
was not a question of liberty with them, but a creed, and MR. WHALLEy, M. P.,
was not, after all, very wrong in many of his remarks. They denounced GARIBALDI
and MazzINI as fiends, and said they would welcome the banners of France flying
upon the mountains of Ireland. It was not that the Irish hated the English be-
cause they were Saxons, but it was because they were of an opposite creed. (‘Oh,
oh/") He believed that if the English came into the bosom of the Holy Catholic
Church—(a laugh)—those Irishmen would hug the chains which bound them now.
(Cheers.) There were State and geographical reasons why he could not ºpº the
resolution, as if it were carried out Ireland might be placed in the hands of a foe to
this country. (Hear, hear!)"
Sense in that last sentence, MR. CREMER, and we suspect that you
have too much brains to be long tolerated by the Council of the
| League. But up and spoke the portentous MUDGE:-
“MR. MUDGE protested against the religious element being introduced into this
matter. People said that the Clerkenwell outrage was a Fenian one, but he believed
it was far more likely to have been a police outrage. (Hear, hear / ) He believed
it was a ruse got up to prevent the *::: of this country from expressing sympathy
with the Irish people. (Hear, hear !) He believed that the ultimate object of the
Government was to stop all free expression of opinion in this country, and to put
down all public meetings. (Hear, hear 1) He no doubt that, if they could, they
would prevent that very meeting of the council.”
We should have been very sorry if they had. For what the Clerken-
well outrage has done for Fenianism thi .# we suspect, has
done for the League. It may be interesting to know that further
discussion was postponed, and that HER MAJESTY cannot be informed,
for, some time, whether she is to be allowed by BEALEs and his
Bubblyjocks to retain Ireland.

MR. PUNCH-DEAR SIR,
- Though a very young man, I would, from feelings of humanity,
raise a warning voice against a system of gaming, which is no less
pernicious than polite. Don't let me be mis-understood. So far as
“book-making” is concerned, my mind is a perfect blank. No man,
I believe, who can write a book ever makes one. My speculations
have been simple, my winnings, as I find on reference to my tablets,
during the past season are as follows, viz.:-
10 Pairs of Paris gloves.
1 Perfumed Sachet.
Seal-skin Gauntlets and Collarette.
1 Diamond Ring (rose-cut-gipsy set).
TENNyson's Idyls of the King, morocco gilt.
20 Complete Copies of Punch, from the Conquest downwards.
TUPPER's Proverbial Philosophy (half-calf).
3 Gold Pencil Cases.
Box of Cigarettes.
1 Jar of Preserved Ginger.
1 lb. of Ratafias.
1 Ivory Fan.
There!, Am not I fortune's favourite? Ought not your corre-
spondent to feel flattered by the smiles of that whimsical arbitratrix,
who blindfolded at the wheel, might be taken for the twin sister of
Justice on the Bench * Bear in mind in every instance where I have
been a winner, I have not given, but accepted a challenge, and learn
with incredulous surprise that all the challengers are my country-
cousins. Girls of spirit I admit, but so imperfectly educated in the
ethics of Tattersall's as to exhibit an ignorance of turf obligations,
which to my moral sense is positively startling. They have lost, but
they don't pay. ...And what makes it still more painful is not merely the
gay tone of indifference in which these defaulters refer to their debts
of honour; but the absence of those roseate tints which are the legacy
of departed innocence, and afford some slight consolation to sufferers
like myself who ineffectually mourn over its remains.

Speaking for myself, long after I arrived at man's estate, I turned
scarlet when accused, whether justly or not, of revoking at short
whist, while the cousins aforesaid have been detected in offences
equally heinous, and remained as passionless and pale as marble. .
In conclusion, I would ask—as a man and a brother—are these irre-
sponsible “persons”, qualified to sit in a representative chamber—to
revise our codes and digest our statutes? Can legislative functions be
safely vested in “lame ducks,” and should not all who answer to that
description be required to discharge their honourable obligations,
before they bring in their bills? JUSTINIAN.

“IA HORSE! GIVE ME ANOTHER HORSE 1"
Y DEAR MR. PUNCH, - As it
seems all the rage at present to
ive what I call Horseman-
eeds, I and two or three other
fellows have determined to get
one up in better style than is
usually attempted. We have
rescued a venerable cab-horse
(dum of course) from the
knacker's, and named KNAGG
Chairman, because of his name;
it seems so suitable, don't it?
Well, you see, that’s just what
we mean it to be, symbolical,
-illustratiye, and that sort of
sº thing. I just want you, dear
* Mr. Punch, to cast your ap-
preciative eye over a rough
sketch of a kind of Pro-
gramme KNAGG and I have
been making out, and tell us
what yºu think of it. I think
it don't sound bad,
First place, KnAgg issues the
invitatiºns for a feed, next
Saturday, in his dining-room—
BLACK, that’s another of our
fellows, wanted us to call it a
- ... "sally manger;” but that’s only
to show off his French, because he was at the Paris Exhibition, and we weren't. He says
“A horse is far more in its place in a manger than in a room.” I can’t deny there’s
something in that. He says he’ll send us, a cheval-glass to decorate the sally manger. Of
course he can if he likes. We mean to have a band, of course; that’s to say we’ve got
Skweeker to promise to come with his fiddle, and give us a tune at the Fº intervals.
He has, composed a grand martial air expressly for the occasion, entitled “To Horse, to
Horse /* This he will play while we seat ourselves at a horse-shoe table, spread with a fair
saddle cloth. -
First Course.—Saddle of horse, with capers; vegetable—grass.
Second Course.—Curried horse. -
Obligato accompaniment from SKWEEKER on one string.
Issh . . . ssh . . . ssh . . ._(as like a groom as he can make it.)
This we expect to be very effective, and cause so much emotion that probably no one will
eat the curry. Still hock is now to be handed round. . .
Third Course—Entrées of horse's trotters, and other kickshaws.
Air, “Trab, Trab,” to which they will be sent trotting.
Salad.—Horse-radish. - - -
Towards the close of the banquet there will be a dish of bridal cake handed round, , and
the stirrup cup will be set on the table; but before this KNAGG and I have agreed he’s to
ask me to sing. Of course, I shall say I'm a little hoarse, and couldn't get through an air.
KNAGG is to reply, he’s not particular, to a horse hair (good, that, isn't it?), and to press
me again, and then I'm to say, “May!”. We reckon on some of our guests here rising and
saying something good about our horsepitality. , We can't very well introduce that ourselves,
but we shall take care to get up a horse-laugh, Well, then the stirrup-cup is to be sent
round, and KNAGG, rising, will give the toast of the evening, Gentlemen, charge your glasses,
“The Horse, and Peace to his Mane-s / , , , .
What do you think of it, Punchey? I think it’ll do.
Yours, admiringly,
John TROTT.
P.S.. I can't help thinking something good might be got out of de-canter. Canter’s plain
enough, but what the d to do with the de. I’m a moral man, and shouldn't wish to swear.

MENDING OUR WAYS.
'ANY Londoner who chances to be driven about Paris must be struck with the extraordinary
smoothness of the streets, and must sigh for French steam-rollers when he returns to
England. However, it is never too late to mend. After being bumped, and bruised, and
shaken, and driven to distraction in every drive we have taken for many a year past, we are
happy to see it stated that :-
“The Commission of Sewers have resolved to substitute asphalt, or fº. as a cement for the usual
granite pavement of the roadway, in place of the ordinary grouting. . This plan will prevent the soft bed
from passing up between, the stones, which will remain firm and level much longer than at present while
the formation of mud will be rendered impossible.”
Fancy London without mud | What a blessing to look forward to Certainly, if gas-pitch
e of service in keeping the streets clean, we hope that no time will be lost in endeavouring
to bring them to such a pitch of excellence. The crossing-sweepers possibly may ask for
compensation; but with the saving in our clothes, from having no more muddy streets, we
could very well afford to compensate the crossing-sweepers.

To combat with their fears.
The journey little comfort brings,
Such trials are in store,
They almost drop

“Your holidays you have enjoyed,

And have some tea,

Some five-and-twenty perhaps sit down
Around the smoking toast:
A sorry sight,
No appetite
That any one can boast.
Teetotallers may prattle ;
It’s very plain to see,
The cup which cheers
These doleful dears,
Is not the cup of tea.
When left alone the old ones seem
A little more resigned;
The new girls meek,
Afraid to speak,
But little comfort find.
Now Night, the old Confessor, comes
To listen to their woes:
What tears are shed
When they’re in bed,
He never will disclose.

Show ING what A wonDERFUL IMPROVEMENT THE Holes IN THE RAILwAY
CARRIAGES ARE, PARTICULARLY DURING THE HOLIDAYs.
A CRY FROM THE CUSTOM HOUSE.
MY DEAR LoRD DERBY,
As first Lord of the Treasury and the Premier of England,
you have probably a fair amount of work upon your hands, and it is
probably as much as ever you can do to look into your Punch. How-
ever, ºf it, for granted you do not neglect this duty, I wish to ask
you privately what you mean to do for the poor clerks in the Customs,
who have appealed to me to get them an increase of their salaries?
They tell me that so far back as last March º had the honour to
memorialise your Lordships of the Treasury, with the object of con-
vincing you that they were sadly underpaid; but then, of course, you
were too busy with reforming the Commons to pay heed to reforming
the poor pay of the Customs. So they (repeated their memorial on
the 13th of December, doubtless hoping (that your Lordships would,
with seasonable benevolence, have given them a Christmas-box to help
to pay their Christmas bills. My good friend SIRTHOMAS FREMANTLE,
the Chairman of their Board, would doubtless willingly have joined with
me in backing their request had there been any prospect that by doing
so he would have profited himself. But SIRTHoMAs has a salary of £2000 a
year, and I fear could hardly furnish you with grounds for its increase.
With Abyssinia and Ireland and some other things to think of, you
i. not find the time to think of helping these poor clerks, although I
make no doubt you would be glad enough to do so. A Conservative
just now is pretty certain to be liberal, and Lancashire well knows you
ave a big bump of benevolence. Among their various grievances the
principal are these :-
“The Customs Department, though one of the most important branches of the
Civil Service, collecting upwards of £22,000,000 annually, and furnishing commercial
statistics of great value, is the worst paid of the Revenue and other large Govern-
ment Departments.
“The examination for admission to the Customs Service is identical with that of
the Inland Revenue; the members of both departments are drawn from the same
class in society, derive their appointments from the same source, and are engaged
in the performance of duties of a very similar character; yet the average salary of
tº:.* latter department is forty-two per cent superior to that of clerks in
My good old friend, SIR Thomas has, himself, no grounds for
grumbling, for he pockets the same salary as the Chairman who pre-

sides over the Board of Inland Revenue, whose clerks, upon the average,
get £235 a year, while the poor Clerks of the Customs are paid upon
the average £70 per annum less. Why, if the Boards are paid alike,
the clerks’ pay should be different, is a riddle which your Lordship
perhaps will beg their Lordships of the Treasury to solve, and the best
thing they could do would be to say, “We give it up;” and then, by
making theſº equal, prevent the question being put to them again.
Another fair cause for a grumble on the part of the poor clerks, who
help to pay into the Treasury some two-and-twenty millions sterling
every year, is that:-
“While the salaries of clerks in many branches of the Civil Service have of late
years been considerably increased, those of clerks in the Customs have remained
nearly unchanged, notwithstanding that the educational standard of qualification
has been materially raised, and that the difficulty in obtaining admission into the
service has been greatly increased by competitive examinations.”
Men with a large income, like you and me, my Lord, of course have
small occasion to trouble our fine minds by thoughts about the price
of bread, and beef and mutton, and other things which poor folk call
the “necessaries of life.” But a newspaper informs me, in an article
which advocates the cause of the poor clerks, that:—
“All the necessaries of life have risen from twenty to twenty-five per cent.
within the last seventeen years; but the salaries paid to the officials in the Custom
House are almost exactly as they were seventeen years ago. In some respects the
prospects of the senior clerks are positively worse.”
Surely, then, your Lordship will agree with me in thinking that John
BULL, in common justice, ought to give his Customs' clerks an increase
of their salaries, to balance the augmented cost of bread and meat.
º in such matters is clearly the best sºliº , for servants who
are badly paid are rarely zealous in good work. . Men who have the
charge of collecting twenty millions every year, for MR. Bull should
not be stinted in their salaries, but encouraged by good pay to do the
best for him they can...Let a liberal per-centage be added to the income
of the poor clerks in the Customs, and, depend on it, the income Ms.
BULL gets from the Customs will also be increased. So well-to-do a
gentleman should really feel ashamed to be a stingy skin-flint in the
payment of his servants; and, as his best adviser, I wºuld beg him in
this matter to listen to the voice of justice and of wisdom, as uttered
to your Lordship, by your Lordship's servant, 338||NC#.

(FROM MY PHOTOGRAPH BOOK.)
TABLEAU XIII.-MY REGRETFUL FRIEND.—A GROUP, “MY COMMIS-
SIONERS.”—AN OLD FRIEND WITH A NEW FACE.
IN turning over the leaves of this Photographic Book, the portrait of
my Regretful Friend may strike your eye. -
... He is the man who is always wishing he hadn't done it, whatever
1, 18.
He regretted having had his likeness taken; having given me this
one instead of another; and, as he had parted with it, regretted gene-
rally the art of Photography, which had, so to speak, imposed on his
trusting nature. -
I meet him on my way home from my Portable Friend’s. I tell him
that I am off for a holiday. He is delighted. “Where P’” He should
so much like to go.
Being without a companion, and liking WINIAMs, I say, “Come.”
I describe to him the pleasures of travelling, omitting the sea-voyage,
He thinks it an excellent idea. When am I going? he wants to know.
“To-morrow morning.”, Can I make it to-morrow evening he in-
quires, . For the sake of his company. “Yes,” I answer, “decidedly.”
“Ah!” he sighs, “I’m very sorry I can't come. I wish I could.
If it had been the week before last—” -
“No time,” I put in, “like the present.” A weak observation at
the best, and not at all calculated to decide an irresolute man. He
points out that there have been many times very like the present; the
week before last, for instance, which was so like that it might have
been mistaken for it. He regrets not having met me yesterday night:
if we’d only met then, it would have been all settled. He regrets
meeting TUMPson then instead of me: he explains that this is his
peculiar luck. - -
Finding him so melancholy, I wish him good-bye. He is still so full
of ts, that I am sure there is a chance of his coming. “Will it
do,” he asks, “if he follows me in a couple of days?”
“Capital,” I answer.
He brightens up. , “He will, certainly: I may depend upon him.”
I don't depend upon him in the least, but wish him good-bye, heartily.
I know that within half-an-hour afterwards, or certainly after dinner
that evening, he is regretting having even committed himself to so much
of a promise. -
I'll wait for no one any longer for my holiday. . . -
Having settled º before explained) my little affairs with THEREsA
and family amicably, I call in, there, to say good-bye.
The Family are at home. I say I am going to Zurich, but
shall take Paris and Brussels on the way, or return by them. They
are all enthusiastic, and it appears that I am about tº do something
very clever. Ferhaps this display, of, freedom of action, before
THEREs A and the Young Officer in the Engineers, who is, metaphori-
cally, tied by the leg, is somewhat galling. Āhat dini soit-il, as our
lively neighbours say in church. Talking of .# neighbours, I ask
in a burst of good-nature, Can I be of any use to them in Paris? To
them, collectively ... I saw the pitfall in a minute.
hº I been my Regretful Friend, I could not have been sorrier for
the lapsus.
They begin, of course, by saying, “No, thank you;” they are much
obliged to me all the same.
Whereupon I am bound in courtesy to press my point. “Are they
sure, because if I can be of any service, &c., &c., they’ve only to name
it, and—&c., &c.” -
“By Jove, old fellow,” cries the Young A.; Officer, suddenly.
“I wish you’d go to TIRALLIER's for me, will you?”
Will I? I handn't included him, confound him; but, “Of course
I' will, with pleasure; only,” I add, smiling, “he must tell me
exactly where What's-his-name's is.” I call TIRALLIER’s “What's-
his-name’s” advisedly, to show him how careless I am about names,
and how unlikely it is he’ll get his commission properly executed at
my hands; “also, exactly what you want,”—exactly sounds formid-
able; “and I'll do my best.”.
gº Thanks,” he returns, heartily, “I’ll write it down.”

Mercy asks me if I won't mind kindly §: to a small shop, near St.
Genéviève’s, where they sell embroidered prints of a religious character;
she wants some for her schools; also what she calls two small chaplets
for children, and if I see, any inexpensive, but effective articles of a
devotional character, small candlesticks, for instance (such a frown from
old CHERITON), “will I get them for her ? And oh, if I please, some

these articles down for me. -
MRs. ChERTToN just hints that if I do see anything in the way of
reasonable fur, cloaks and wrappers, not to trouble myself about
buying them there, and then, but to write a line to her as to the
price. - - - -
I make a note of this, and the Artillery Officer gives me his instruc-
tions. Two seven chambered revolvers, pea-bullet size for drawing-
room use; a telescope rifle, with cleaner, powder-flask, and everything
to match, on the three-times-a-second principle. He adds, that he
doesn't know exactly what the price will be, but if I’ll kindly settle,
he’ll square up with me on my return; as if that was a noble and
generous action on his part.
I rise to go; I remind myself of the merchant in Beauty and the
Beast who takes his daughter's commissions.
Beauty, I mean Sophia THEREs A, comes up last. May, she trust
me, she says, winningly, to pick her out the newest shape in bonnets?
“In for a penny, in for a pound:” in for devotional candlesticks
and three-times-a-second loading revolvers, and in for a bonnet or two,
more or less.
I will. Good-bye, all round. -
“Oh!” says the eldest daughter married, suddenly recalling a fact;
“you’ll he there (meaning in Paris), on le jour de l'an, the first day of
the year.
“I think I shall be,” I say: “why?” -
“Oh!” she returns, “I shall be so much obliged if you’ll go to that
shop on the Boulevard des Italiens—the great shop you know, and get
me a lot of bonbons for the children: you can't get anything like
them in England.” -
The little boy of twelve is there. By instinct he cries out, “And

numerous friends.
“Good-bye! good-bye!” all most heartily;
“I won't forget, will I?” “Oh, no.” “It’s not too much trouble,
is it?” “Not a bit.” Of course, delighted.
Old CHERTToN, who has some sense in his head, grasps me warmly
by the hand, and says, “My dear fellow, it’s too bad of the ladies to
bother you in this way.”
He is right; but naturally I say, “Oh, dear me, not at all,” and
“Don’t mention it.”
Still holding my hand, he says, kindly, “You know Paris well, no
doubt?” I see that he is going to give me some paternal advice as
to my conduct in that gay metropolis, so I at once tell him (with not
perhaps an exact regard for truth, but a great one for expediency), that
‘I know it almost as well as I know London; and shan’t go,” I add,
º “very wrong there.”
It’s just what I oughtn't to have said.

This, is old CHERTTON's last request. One sensible thing he does
add, which is, that if it bothers me very much, I needn't do it.
Once more, “Good-bye.”. They continue thanking me over and over
again, as if I’d brought all the things back. I tear myself away.
I'd half a mind to ask them for the money for these things. When
I get them, how on earth shall I ever Fº the Custom-House ?

going to have a smoke. There are no signs of the smoke at present,
but he must soon, with naturally generated heat, if he continues

I light up. I should like, I think, as I open m evening paper, to
have a photograph in my book of that creature as he is: name, under-
neath, “The Gentleman who is § to have a smoke.”

doubtedly. No, he’s perfectly still.

Not a dog in with the gentleman who is going to have a smoke? No.
I hate a row; and before I take the initiative in a case of this sort,
I always find it advisable to think once or twice, and reason the matter
out thus: “We both having paid, have an equal right to be here.
True... I gave the Guard a shilling for the privilege of smoking : why
shouldn't he have paid a shilling, or even more, for the privilege of
growling. I don't know. Again, smoking is against the regulations:
growling isn't. So far, in an argument he would get the best of it.
Only, I've been admitted here under false pretences; the Guard ought
to have told me that this was not ‘the gentleman who was going to
have a smoke, but ‘the gentleman who was going to have a growl.’”
What shall I do?
He is-yes, he is rising from his seat gradually: an invalid, . I

Nurs”. “PERHAPs, MA'AM, you'd LIKE to come AND SMooth Your HAIR IN My Mistress's Room ?”
Little#Innocent. “Oh No ; Do STAY HERE!—AT LEAst, IF You Don't MIND TAKING off YoUR HAIR BEFore ME."
THE QUEEN’S BOOK.
Let cynics scoff and worldlings sneer,
And cold aristocrats condemn;
Their censure weighed not in her ear,
Her counsel was not ta'en with them.
A wiser, womanlier thought
Whispered within her woman's heart:-
“They that my solace would have wrought,
They in my grief shall have their part.
“The love I mourn, for whom I go
In mourning, ever, to the end
What England lost in him they know,
How sure a guide, how firm a friend;
“But what the loss the wife, and Queen,
Had in that nature, pure and sweet,
That judgment, steady and serene,
That counseſ swift all needs to meet,
“That light of #. within the home,
That fount of peace beside the hearth,
That gravity, which ne'er was gloom,
That glee as pure as maiden's mirth—
“All this my people cannot know,
All this I only can make known,
That they may ſº the joy and woe
I knew with him, now know alone.
“So tº life, my walks and ways,
The wife's and mother's, not the Queen's,
My treasured tale of happier days,
My record of love-hallowed scenes,
“I’ll open to m people's eyes,
And therein § them take their part,
That they may weigh the weight that lies
On my lone life and widowed heart.
“Till feeling what my joy has been,
They feel how vast my grief must be :
And, when my treasure they have seen,
May measure what its loss to me.”
What Queen like this was ever known,
To take her people to her heart?
When was Queen's household-life so shown
With modest truth and artless art
The Royal Widow has done well
Thus on her people's love to call,
Her simple wifely tale to tell,
And trust her joys and griefs to all.
Ne'er since Victoria felt the Crown
A weight upon her ; brow,
Have Heaven's best blessings been called down
About her path, as they are now.
A Model Uncle.
A smart Pawnbroker that, at Ratcliff, who was nevertheless too
smart and came to smarting. He takes a poor woman's clock in pawn.
Yes, that is his lawful business. But it was not his, lawful business,
but his unlawful pleasure, to divide the clock into three parts-face,
weights, and º. and issue three tickets, for each of which he
charged, and each of which bore interest. The Magistrate told him
so, and by way of impressing the fact on his memory fined him heavily.
Thus poor wives are cheated, while their husbands go gaping after
Potter and BEALEs.

thought it was a regular Carnival.
English Habitué (nodding to Friends). Mon cher, see this once (nods to
more Friends) and it’s always the same. (Nods again.) You ought to know
a lot of people here. (Recognises and nods to male Friends.)
English Friend (who knows nobody, feels the truth of the remark). Yes.
(Sees a French Swell, with a Domino on his arm, coming up to his Friend.)
Who’s this P
[Feels he’d like to be introduced to anyone, and especially when such
a pair of eyes shine from beneath the mask.
Habitué. This? (Aside to him.) He’s the little MARQUIs DE LON-
GUEPáE: fought fifteen duels.
English Friend (feels that he’d rather not be introduced; or if he is, that
he must mind his p’s and q's with the Domino). Oh! indeed
Marquis. Ah, mon cher! (Whispers in his ear.)
Habitué. Wraiment? -
Marquis. Je l'ai vu. Tenezl (Takes his arm.)
Habitué (to Friend). Excuse me a minute. I’ll join you again here
by the door of entry. -
[Disappears with the Marquis and the Domino in the crowd. English
Visitor experiences a dreadful sense of isolation, and wishes he
was at home. Thinks how gay he has always heard these balls
are. Expects to hear sparkling wit from the Masquers. Listens
or it.

Brunette Domino. Tiens! (Stops English isolated stranger.) Ah! mon

Brunette. You speak English, n'est-ce pas ?
English Visitor (slightly disconcerted). Moi!—I—oui—yes.
Light Domino. Il est un Ruski.
English Visitor (catching at the word). Ruski? bien. (Thinks he’s
had enough of this wit.) Au revoir.
Brunette Domino (giving the whole point of the interview). Nous offres-
tu a souper ?
English Visitor. Nous verrons. (Taking a leaf out of M. ERNEST's
book as recorded above.) Trois heures à la porte d’entrée.

[Thinks he’ll see what the merry dancers are doing. Enters the lobby,
and stands at the top of the steps leading into the Pit part.
Superb Official (peremptorily). Il faut que vous descendez, M'sieu !
[English Visitor unwarily goes down, and subsequently finds that once
among the gay masquers he cannot return, ercept by going all
round and back again to the other side of the Foyer. Experientia
docet. He comes against a Friend.
English Visitor (delighted). Hullo! JENNINGs, old boy!
[Doesn't care about “JENNINGs, old boy,” at home.

Jennings...Ah! you here? ... (With intense enjoyment of La Vie Parisi-
enne Quadrille now being performed.) Nothing like this in London, eh?
English Visitor. No, you’re right.
Jennings. I say, look there. (They look there and are much edified).
That's over. Now let’s walk round.
Bows to a veiled Lady in a private bor.
English Visitor. Who's your friend?
Jennings. English people. I’ve just been talking to the Lady and
her husband. They find it awfully slow.
English Visitor (honestly). This part of the *; is slow. No real

Habitué (joining them). Oh, here you are § with an “Ain’t-I-

there? I hear it’s the PRINCEss— But I’d better not say the
name. She’s coming to speak to me again.
Jennings (who knows Paris). I know her. Elle est petillante d'esprit.
Habitué (with the pride of a Don Juan). Now, look here. (Domino
approaches.) Ma petite chère
Domino (haughtily). Monsieur ! (Then abruptly.) Allez vous en chez

to be true. The Domino passes on, and is joined by two other
ladies.

Habitué (disgusted, to his Friends). Let’s go and sup.
English Visitor. Supper by all means.
[330 a.m. Cafés all alight in the upper parts. Discreet, waiters
moving about with dishes and wines. Paris all alive by night,
until breakfast time, when Les Jolis Vireurs retire, the Church
doors open, and the ouvriers go to work as usual.
English Visitor (to Friend at same hotel). Must go to bed, I suppose.
(Fawning.) Rather fun, though. Wonders where the fun was.
His Friend. Yes (doubtfully). Rather. (Gives the moral.) Wouldn't
do every week; though they do it. (Thinks over the point.) Good night.
English Visitor. Bon jour.
[Turns to sleep in the peaceful consciousness of having seen a Bal
d'Opéra in Paris, and at all events done the correct thing.
Habitué (strolling to his apartments). “Votre femme !” Odd.
Couldn’t have known 1–By Jove, I must write home.
[Retires to rest, Dimanche 730 a.m. being in Paris “on business
of the utmost importance.”
The Wrong Animal.
THE delayed replacement of the Hyde Park railings at Knightsbridge
is the fault of somebody. A correspondent of the Times, whose letter
is signed “WILLIAM Lyon,” contends that the parties to blame are
not the Westry of St. George's, Hanover Square, nor the Metropolitan
Board of Works, but the Government. He concludes his statement
by saying that he trusts that it "may have the effect of placing the
saddle on the right horse.” Ought he not rather to have said, the
right donkey?
SPORT FOR US.
The favourite game of the Spanish Merchant might be varied for
the delectation of the lighthearted—a definition which , of...course
excludes anybody who has trusted Spain. “I am a Spanish Minister,
and I have something to sell.” “Is it alive º’” “Just. How
many legs?” “None to stand on.” “Is it rational?” “No.”
“Give it up.” “A creditor.”

Stumpey. Any more Fenian outrages * - - ---
Dibbs. Not that I know of. Am in hopes the panic is subsiding.
Stumpey. But what are we to do with Ireland P -
Dibbs. Colonise it. Didn't you read ALIQUIs's letter in the Times?
Stumpey. Who’s ALIQUIs -
Dibbs. I don't know. But he says he is somebody, and that he
hºut ’s what about Irish affairs. And he says, “Colonise
reland.
Stumpey. Well, but are not the Irish population emigrating P and
isn’t that considered a good job
Dibbs. Why, yes. There are too, many Irish in Ireland—but not
enough English. At least, that’s what “ALIQUIs”, thinks. His idea
is, that the truth of the matter about Ireland, and the root of the evil
is that the Irish people are all crazy.
Stumpey. Oh! but that’s a joke. .
Dibbs. No, indeed, he is quite serious. He gravely gives it as his
opinion that the only way to deal with Ireland is “by spreading over
an impracticable, almost a lunatic community, such little colonies as
we could of sane men.” And he puts it still stronger when he asks
the question, “How can you spread a sprinkling of sane men, like
wheat, over the insane human chaff of to-day ?” -
Stumpey. Insane human chaff! Is that what he calls, the Irish *
No, come; they are not mad—but some of their editors will be at being
chaffed like that. -
Dibbs. Great wit—who is it says?—to madness nearly is allied. Macy
Irishmen are men of first-rate ability. But still the Irish are as a race
—well—peculiar. -
Stampey. What’s the wheat which he proposes to scatter over
the chaff? -
Dibbs. Well, he says something about English convicts.
Stumpey. That’s complimentary. English convicts the wheat to
Irish chaff!
Dibbs. He doesn't exactly say that he would colonise Ireland
STUMPEY. DIBBs.
altogether with convicts. He speaks of the “representatives of the
extreme of our social system,” and the “rescued scum of the United |
Kingdom.”
Stumpey. Won't he have the Irish hornets about his ears
. Dibbs. But then he would have the scum “helped towards regenera-
tion by men of proved probity and self-restraint from the Army, Navy
and Constabulary of the United Kingdom.” He also mentions Dea
and Yarmouth boatmen to work the fisheries. “Many and many
hundreds of miles of coast swarming with unmolested fish.”
Stumpey. The fisheries would pay. . But how about the land P
Dibbs. There are millions of acres, he says, that would pay for recla-
mation. He would plant them with trees and stock them with game.
Then, he *f; they would rival the Scotch forests.
Stumpey. There's something in what MR. Allquis, or Lorp ALIQUIs
or whoever he is, says: Englishmen and Scotchmen in lireland would
very likely develope its resources. But they'd want English capital.
Dibbs. What do you say to an Improvement of Ireland Company
(Limited), to colonise and cultivate Ireland?
Stumpey. Capital idea.
Dibbs. For capitalists—ehº
Stumpey, You don't mean that for a joke?
Dibbs. Quite the reverse.
Stumpey. Then I do think it capital.

Stumpey. The money is now all lying idle.
Dibbs. Very well, then. Let’s set to work instantly, and draw out
a prospectus. Improvement of Ireland Company. just the thing
wanted to bring about revival of confidence and legitimate speculation.

THE POET'S PAGE.
MR. RQBERT BRowNING has afforded a proof that a Poet is what
the name implies, somebody who can Make. He has made a tribunal
do justice, and a tradesman eat humble-pie. A MR. PAGE charged
him—sued him—for two, bottles of port wine, at four shillings each,
bottles included (O lor!), and had the bard before the Marylebone
Court. The proof broke down, MR. BRowNING stating that he never
drank ; wine, and never had ordered any of anybody. That a Jury,
notwithstanding, did not instantly find for a brother tradesman is to
be accounted for only in one way. The Judge decided for the poet.
Then came out the poetical nature—he gave the costs to the poor-box.
But he justly complained that he had been obliged to waste a day,
because a tradesman did not use proper caution in his business. There
was no implication that the charge was intentionally fraudulent, and
on the whole PAGE should be proud that his name has been coupled
with BRowNING.'s, unwelcome as may be the lesson which the poet has
scrawled on the page. What say the Philistines to a poet teaching

“WELL said, old mocker, I must needs be friends with thee.”
So, in Shakespearian phrase, remarks Mr. Punch to MR. BEALEs.
Early in last week the latter statesman was in a great rage with the
former, called his remarks by vulgar names, and declared that he did
not heed them at all, so long as he had “his praises chanted” (sic) by
MEssRs. GoLDwiN SMITH and FAwcETT. How far these accom.

the end of the week, so lofty and aristocratic, an apology, at a League
Council, that there is an end, until he offends again. e recognise
the blue blood, and drop the point of our rapier:—
“Mr. BEALEs, the Chairman, said if he had anything to tax himself with in
conducting the discussions of the League it was that of being too lax. If the
meetings had been composed of gentlemen of his own class, he should not have
allowed many things that have occurred; but as they were composed mostly of
working-men, he did not like,” &c., &c.
Just so—and we have done. Mrs. Candour could not have let her
friends down more agreeably than PRESIDENT BEALEs drops his
Council. Is the same rule to be adopted when the Council gets into

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BRITANNIA TO AUSTRALIA.
MY DEAR DAUGHTER, -
You have come out. You have been presented to my sailor
Prince. You have pleased º: old mother vastly by your splendi
celebration of this one of the greatest events in your life, and she is
eager to offer you her thanks and congratulations. - -
hear you are a fine, handsome lass, with a bush of golden hair,
blooming and buxom, who have not yet done growing-figure rather
fuller than mine, but features much the same. I hope, the family
likeness will be preserved through many centuries and cycles to
come, and that when you are as old as I am you may look as well as I
o, and have as few wrinkles and furrows, as after all my years and
trials, my time-beaten visage shows. - - - - -
So young, too! only four-score! for Sydney will keep her eightieth
birthday this very year... I am conscious that when I, was your age I
was not able to give balls and banquets, or dazzle with transparencies
and illuminations (piping times for your gas-fitters), ºr breed Mayors
and Corporations, or erect Exhibition buildings as big as your old
friend Westminster Hall. I am afraid I was subsisting on acorns and
berries, and painting myself a warm blue, and going and coming nude
as your own aborigines. So spread, so developed at 80, what will you
not be at 800? You are the superb young beauty, the rose, on your
cheek, the brilliant in your eye, full of life and expectation, with many
squires to hold up your train of cloth of gold, and a long and trium:
ant career before you. I am the mature matron, with a silver thread
É. and there in my glossy hair, and a line or two on my ample brow,
but handsome and stately still, proud of my bonny daughter, proud to
betold that she resembles her mother, wondering whether she will make
the great conquests I have made, or stand amidst the affluence of pos:
sessions that I can command, and wishing her with heart and voice all
the ºf. that I have known, without a tithe of my suffering, or a
tenth of my sorrow. -
My Daughter, do not listen to those who will tell you that I have
seen my best days, and that there is no prospect for me but decrepitude
and decay. I mean to be the Methuselah of nations, the evergreen of
kingdoms. I have no intention, at present, of dismantling London
Bridge, or converting St. Paul's into a picturesque ruin. I mean
to live to see your future prosperity as far, exceed your present,
as your present does that forlorn time of Cook and BANKs from
which our own is separated by such a scanty handful, of years;
You, in your turn, will have to colonise and emigrate, and you will
bless me with lusty and vigorous grandchildren. Your stride will
lengthen, your pace will quicken; but don't make the running too
soon, don't go too fast. - - -
You resemble your mother in many things. Like her you have your
Ministers, your Parliaments, your Speakers; your Reohabites, your
Druids, your Odd Fellows. You would not be a woman if you had
not your Opposition; you would not be my child if you were without
your jobs and blunders. I doubt not that you have your Usher of the
Black Rod, your Beadles, and your Waits. I am sorry that you
have no Lord Mayor, but I hope, as some compensation, that you are
not Westry-ridden. I notice that you have what I cannot afford, your
“Free Gardeners,” and “Free Banquet.” Send me the Gardeners'
address, and some dinner tickets, will you? and a case or two of your
beef (without bone), would not come amiss. Are your Metropolitan
streets as dirty as mine? In the bustling thoroughfares of Melbourne,
or Sydney, or any other of your several capitals, do you take a human
life nearly every other day in the year, as indifference and stupidity
do in London 2 Are you old enough to have vested interests and a
National Debt? - -
In some points I cannot compete with you. I possess no marsupial
creatures for an active young Duke to stalk down (partridges at Sand-
ringham, and pheasants at Osborne, will be tame sport after elephants
at the Cape, and kangaroos in the Bush); I cannot emulate your
emus, except, perhaps, in the enclosures of the Zoological Gardens;
the Ornithorhyncus is not one of my domestic animals; there are no
auriferous diggings in Regent Street, and at present I have not heard of
º being picked up in the Strand by zealous agents of the Gold-
smiths’ Company; my sheep-walks and cattle-drives are mere toys and
laythings compared with yours; you enjoyed a Session of Parliament
asting exactly three-quarters of an hour; “and not a single person was
put into the lock-up that night for misbehaviour.” Bravo, Melbourne!
and not a teetotal population either. , Hull, and Newcastle, and Not-
tingham, and other towns of mine of about the same size as Melbourne,
mark, learn, and copy. But, my Daughter, we have one necessary of
life in common; there is one great banner of which we both hold a
pole, and the blazon that sparkles upon it is Punch /
I wish your geography was rather simpler. , My young men, whose

:
DOG DAYS OUT OF DATE.
How very benevolent we
are, some of us!
How extremely hu-
mane! Not only do
we relieve the dis-
tresses of our fellow-
men, but we even
minister to the wants
of our fellow-crea-
tures on four legs.
Witness the en-
suing item of recent
news :-
“CHRISTMASTREE For
Starving Dogs.-A no-
velty in the way of rais-
ing money to help the
Starving Dogs of London
—a Christmas Tree, with
rizes for all visitors—is
operation this week at
the offices of the Royal
Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Ani-
mals, in New Bond
Street.”
Out of curiosity, if
not charity, many
H. will very
ikely be disposed to
- - go to inspect this
Christmas-tree for the canine species. They may want to know
whether or no the tree selected to serve for the benefit of the
dogs is, appropriately, dog-wood. It may, interest them to examine
the * of which the fruit is to be devoted to the bow-wows.
The bark of every tree is silent, but those who cannot expect to
hear this dogs' tree may wish to see it., They, however, who have
money to give away had better, before they devote any of it to the
succour of starving dogs, wait until they shall have contributed a
sufficiency for the rescue of human outcasts from starvation. The
destitution at the East End ought to be put an end to first, and it will
be soon enough to think of appeasing the hunger of dogs when that of
the famishing inhabitants of the Isle of Dogs has been satisfied. We
know that hungry dogs are not º about the puddings they eat,
which accordingly cost little, but are still too dear whilst there are
poor people who get no pudding at all.
DR. DISRAELL’S ACADEMY.
DR. DisRAELI ºl. his pupils to take notice that his Academy
re-opens on the 13th proximo, after the Christmas holidays, and he
hopes to see them all re-assembled on that day in order that their
ucation may proceed without further delay.
To the friends of young Conservatives who may not yet have been
confided to DR. DISRAELI's care he ventures to say that his system of
Education, though conducted upon the most gentle principles, pro-
duces results which may fairly be described as startling. After a few
months of DR DISRAELI's tuition a pupil who has previously been so
neglected as to be unable, without an effort, to follow the simplest
argument in favour of improvement, will deliver an eloquent address
in advocacy of radical reform, and the most experienced listener will
not be able to discover that it has not been the one study and object
of the speaker's life.
DR. DISRAELI respectfully invites the friends, and guardians of
youthful Conservatives to attend the speech-nights at the Academy
and judge for themselyes. , He would, particularly request their
presence on the nights (of which, due notice will be given) when his
pupils will debate the subject of Secular Education, and when some of
those whose backwardness and stolidity have been the grief of their
acquaintances are expected to manifest a most remarkable advance.

MAJOR BROWN;
OR, A SHORT CUT TO GLORY.
To the land of the gorilla
Went the dauntless MAJOR BRow N ;
Took he neither scrip nor siller
When he left his native town.
Nothing took he when he started,
Saving leave of MRs. B. ;
Nothing said he when they parted,
Only “You’ll remember me!”
Crossed he then the stormy ocean
In the A 1. packet “Punch; ”
Gave he to the sea a notion
Of the things he’d had for lunch.
Called himself a wretched sinner
When the vessel heaved the most ;
Fancied giving up his dinner
Worse than giving up his ghost.
“Land at last,” and all the wonders
That are Afric's soon he knew:
Afric's native black who plunders,
Kills, and cooks, and eats you too !
All the man-and-beastly dangers,
Bird and fish, a fearful host—
Such as welcome little strangers
Like the Major to its coast.
When at first the king of monkeys
Met him with an ugly grin,
Being somewhat in a funk, his
Bullet barely raised the skin;
But instead it raised the dander
Of that most malignant ape,
Who, with one adroit left-hander,
Knocked the Major out of shape.
After this he#: on better;
Killed gorillas by the score:
And an extract from a letter
Dated April, sixty-four, -
Says, “herewith, my dearest cousin,
My return of game I send:
Full-grown monkeys—fifteen dozen;
Smaller animals—no end.”
Years elapsed, and then to London
Homeward travelled MAJoR BRowN,
And his great deeds—done and undone—
Soon were common talk in town.
All the Leo Hunter party
Took the Major by the hand;
Read his journal, bought his Carte-de-
Visite, and a banquet planned.
So, my friends and fellow-flunkeys,
See how easily fame is won;
Pay your passage, pot your monkeys,
Presto, fly! the deed is done !
Bag the beasts, as once Orion
§ in Chios—southward roam :
Go abroad, and be a “lion”—
You're an ass to stop at home !
A BOB'S-WORTH OF EDUCATION.
No Greek
No Latin' '
No Grammar !!!
No Moral Philosophy' ' ' '
No Logic! !!!!
No History !!! !!!
But instead—
English Language (Miscellaneous).
French and German (ad lib.).
Practical Science (as much as you can get);
Synthetical Mathematics (as little as you please).-
Isn't either of these, without the other, rather a Lowe view of educa-
tion, aſter all?
An Event.—A Sporting Gentleman lately ran his Head against a
Door-post. We have not heard which won.

CURIOSITIES OF NATURAL HISTORY.
Lizzy. “Oh, PAPA, what Do You THINK GEORGE HAs CAUGHT 7"
Naturalistic Papa. “WHAT, DEAR}"
Lizzy. “Why, A RING-WoRM 1"
A WORD FOR THE NEW OPERA.
SPEAKING as a musical, a risible and a sensible man, Mr. Punch has not enjoyed
any public entertainment so much for many weeks past as that which is now given
at the New St. George's Opera House. To say that what is seen and heard
there is “as good as a play” is not to speak the truth exactly, for—as plays go
now-a-days—it is a great deal better. Sprightly, pleasant singing is added to
fair acting; and though both fall short at present of what one may expect at the
French Opéra º: it may be hoped that further practice may lead to
French perfection. The band indeed are quite as good as need be wished;
and, if all the singers acted as well as MR. Shaw, their songs would tell far better.
Unlike most so-called comic singers, MR. Shaw is really funny: nor is there any
whit of coarseness or vulgarity about him. A comic English tenor is more difficult
to catch, and the tenor is at present a weak point at the New Opera House.
English singers as a rule have not a notion how to act, and might learn a useful
lesson from quiet MR. SHAw and noisy MR. AYNsley Cook, who, it may be from
the contrast, seems a trifle over boisterous. MADAME (why not MRs. *) FINLAY-
son has also a fair notion with what gestures to accompany her voice, and
can sing gay, sprightly songs without destroying their effect by looking glum
and solemn, as most English singers do.
That the songs are gay, and sprightly, which one heard at this new Opera
House, nobody can doubt when he sees the names of Orrºca and suivas on
the play-bill, and knows what gay and sprightly music they can write. That
the latter, can write music which is good as well as gay, º be horribly stale
news to all who know his works. There is plenty of good music in the pleasant
little º which he has last composed, and the more of his new operas we hear
at the New Opera House the more we shall be pleased.
It has been stated that “the British Public is an Ass,” and in the matter of
its amusements there is truth in the remark. Only people having ears as long as
those of Bottom, when Titania fell in love with him, would listen, to the vulgar,
stupid, singing at a music-hall, when such pretty, lively music as that at the new
opera-house is nightly to be heard. Support is what this opera now needs for its
success; and if the British Public foolishly lets slip this opportunity of seeing
Comic Qpera established here in England, Mr. Punch will but repeat “the
British Public is an Ass.”

SERVANTS' HALL IN THE STREET.
Lonpon warns Cape Town that any attempt to
See “Morning Post.”
TUNE:—Parochial Psalm.
KIND Christian friends and brethren dear,
Before you here this day,
We are ashamed thus to appear,
In this disgraceful way,
Which we, that better days have known,
Do now declare to you
It is necessity alone
Occasions us to do.
We once were servants at a "Squire's
In happier days gone by:
Though then our meals did our desires
Not fully satisfy:
But yet the victuals weren't so bad
But what we all did thrive:
The number every day we had
Amounted unto five.
For breakfast, bread-and-butter, toast,
Eggs, tea and coffee too,
With bacon, which may be almost
Too much for some of you.
For lunch we oft had bread and meat
And never did we fail
Of bread-and-cheese, enough to eat,
To drink, of ample ale.
For dinner joints we did obtain,
Pastry likewise had we,
And bread-and-butter had again,
And buttered toast for tea.
On bread-and-cheese, or meat once more,
At supper we were fed, ---,
And also had our ale before -
We went, each night, to bed.
But, oh, we couldn't rest content,
But more must need require,
And in a body so we went
Complaining to the "Squire.
Our wants he couldn't understand,
And him we had to tell,
We steaks for breakfast did demand,
Besides, and chops as well.
The DUKE of CAMBRIDGE, well we knew,
Was coming there to stay:
A threat of striking out we threw,
And master then gave way;
Which, when his Royal Highness left,
He straightway º ...if
We grumbled, of the boon bereft;
Then he dismissed us all.
So here we are, all out of place,
From holding out for board,
Which everywhere we found the case
No master would afford.
Of those five meals a day we had,
When we were in employ,
Oh, now we should be very glad
One only to enjoy!
We feel, at this inclement time,
And season of the year, .
Accustomed to abundance prime,
Privation is severe. ..
On us poor souls, who didn't know
When we were too well fed,
Kind Christian friends, your help bestow
To buy a bit of bread.

THE ARISTOCRACY OF TO-MORROW.
SoME short-sighted people, observing that the landed property of
the kingdom is passing into the hands of modern money-makers, thence
predict the extinction of the British Aristocracy. But those who are
able to see into the future, discern that an Aristocracy will still exist
in these dominions, only it will be one which will have replaced
another. In the Morning Post of hereafter, they have read the
following announcements:–
The DUKE of Cotton, from his Grace's Factory, at Manchester,
has arrived at the Clarendon.
.The EARL of Gasworks has quitted the Plant, Victoria Park, for
his seat in Derbyshire. -
The MARQUIs of CHIMNEys is entertaining a distinguished circle
at Falconbridge Hall, the venerable and once hereditary mansion of
the Mowbrays, lately purchased by the noble Marquis.
The coming of age of the Hon. MR. MAx, the eldest son of LoRD
JUNIPER, was celebrated yesterday with great festivities at the great
Distillery of Max & Co., Lambeth, which establishment bears the
family name of the noble Lord who is the head of the firm. This
auspicious event afforded occasion for a réunion of the most distin-
guished members of the aristocracy.
A grand battue took place on the 29th instant at Ravenstone Castle,
the recently acquired property of LoRD WIscount FITz GUANo, the
wealthy owner of the extensive Dry Earth Artificial Manure Manufac-
tory at Roseville. The company included several leading members of
the peerage, and they bagged, on an average, each 248 head of game.
. The *: which wesome time ago had the honour of announc-
º: was on the tapis between LoRD FRIBBINs, son and heir of the
ost Honourable the MARQUIs of MUSLIN (chief partner in the house
of FRIBBINs & Co.), and the LADY ADEliza. EMMELINE PENDRAGoN,
eldest daughter of the EARL of Snowdon, was celebrated yesterday
at St. George's, Hanover Square, by the Bishop of LoNDoN, assisted
by the HoN, and Rev. MR. MERLIN, uncle of the bride. The wedding
breakfast was held at the extensive establishment in Regent Street
and the happy pair left town for Cairngorm Castle, the Highland
residence º}%. INVERBoGIE.
When the landed property of the United Kingdom shall have changed
hands, the new territorial proprietors, doubtless, will come to enjoy
the same honours as those which the old ones did. Worthiness to be
ennobled, heretofore deemed exclusively peculiar to distinction in
arms or statesmanship, will hereafter be considered to accrue from
success in commerce ; and the aristocracy which that will have created
will take a natural pride in being contradistinguished from their feudal
predecessors by having their titles derived from the mills, warehouses,
and other premises, or appurtenances to premises and places of busi-
ness where they made their money, or from commodities which they
grew rich by dealing in.
A Good Hearing for Erin.
THE Standard says:— -
“A Dublin-paper announces that the PRINCE of WALEs is to visit Ireland in
April next, to be present at the Punchestown races.”
If this is true—and we hope it is—the PRINgE could not have deter-
mined on any excursion more gratifying to Ireland, or more compli-
mentary to Mr. Punch, who will make a point of visiting his ancestral
home at the time named, and receiving his Royal HIGHNess with
appropriate splendour. He will also, as a sporting man, give a plate,
one of his best, in honour of the happy occasion.
A LITERARY STATES MAN.
AN advertisement announces a letter from EARL Russell to the
RIGHT Hon. CHICHESTER FoRTEscue on the state of Ireland. Who
is England's most notorious man of letters? Surely EARL Russell.

pUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FEW FRIENDS.
(FROM MY PHOTOGRAPH BOOK.)
TABLEAU XIII. —ContLNUED.
“You here !” - -
“What’s left of me,” replies GRIgg. As if he couldn't say, simply,
“Yes”. But that comes of being a Funny Friend. . -
“Going to Dover?” I ask. He nods. If he’s going on to Paris,
I think to myself, we shall be together the whole way. “Perhaps
he'll stop at Dover ?” I ask.
“No,” he returns, “The sea! The sea! The blue, the fresh—"
By the way, I hope it’s not too fresh.” -
I hope not, too. I picture to myself being wretchedly unwell on
board the packet, and GRigg funnier than ever. He'd mislead the
Steward; he'd tell me funny stories, or talk about things I don't like
for dinner. - - --- - -
My Funny Friend on board a steamboat will be an infliction. I
think I'll stop at Dover. Then I shall waste a day, and, I can't afford
to waste a day. As it is, I shouldn't be surprised if the authorities
sent me orders to inspect French factories, for the sake of information,
during º, vacation. -
GRigg begins talking about Paris. He knows it well. I don't. He
says º can speak French fluently, but is somewhat out of practice at
present.
Question to º: Shouldn't one look over, or try to put up with,
his eccentricities, because he will be undoubtedly useful tº me. road,
if I am with him. He knows the place and the language thoroughly.
He tells me about everything there is to be seen, in the gay ca ital.
I've been to Paris before, but it strikes me that either I’ve never been
out of one street, or I’ve not ventured beyond a certain point, for I
seem to have missed more than three-quarters of the amusements that
GRIGG knows all about. Skating fêtes, midnight illuminations, opera
balls, masked balls at the Châtelet, casino dances, the Students’ gos-
tume balls—on all these subjects his information is immense. The
theatres, the actors, the actresses, he knows all about these too, and
his stories of past times fire my imagination until, on my word, I rather
think I was in luck when I accidentally tumbled on my Funny Friend
going to Dover. -
“Got a passport?” he asks, suddenly.
“No,” I reply; “None is required.” -
“True,” is his answer to this, “so they say. But just now it is as
well to have one. For instance, how could you prove you weren't
STEPHENs in disguise f"
I think for a moment... I confess I don't see at this moment how I
could prove it satisfactorily, even to myself.
“You’d send for your Great Aunt, Pº. suggests GRIgg.
I look at him, narrowly to see if he's begun .."; No, he is
* Well, he's right. I suppose I should send for my Great
unt.
“That doesn’t get you out of the difficulty,” he continues. “I
º: she hasn't got a passport P And if they won’t believe her ?
And suppose that they insist upon her being an accomplice of
STEPHENs's, eh?”
“Well, but, my dear. GRIGG,” I say; “the French Government
can’t do anything, even if I was STEPHENs.” If I go on talking in this
train I shall begin to identify myself with the escaped Head Centre,
GRIgG is surprised, at me : at me, he says, “who are so mixed up
with the authorities.” Did I never hear, he wants to know, of the
September Convention and the Treaty of Üirecht?
I say of course I’ve heard of the September Convention. But that
was about the Pope, and—
GRIgG laughs sarcastically, and charges me with trying to humbug
him. He says if I want to joke, say so, and he'll be the first to enjoy
it, but there are times for talking seriously, and this is one of them.
I own I am glad to hear him speak in this manner, and I suppose his
erformance as a bear was only a temporary burst of *spirits.
ut seriously, then, about a passport. ...
“Well, seriously,” says he, “as you haven't got one—I have
and he shows me the edge of a green leather book, labelled “Passport,”
but which, being among a lot of papers, pipes, and odds-and-ends in
his travelling-bag, he can't pull out entirely—“and it is, as well to be
guarded. Besides, if you were short of cash in Paris, it's useful then,
and in many other cases. Take my advice, and get one.”
“I will. How P’’
“Well,” he says, deliberating, “don’t stop before Paris, but when
you get there, get the waiter at your hotel (or I’ll show you) to take
you to the Mont-de-Piété—you know what that means—”
‘Yes,” I say; but, as an afterthought, thinking it better to be
candid, I confess that I don't know exactly, having, indeed, a general
sort of motion that it's a monastery.
“No, not a monastery,” explains GRIgg, who evidently does know
Paris very well, “but a religious house for decayed Relations. As in
the monasteries you call the monks Pères, or fathers, so here you call
»
them. Oncles, or uncles; and in some places, like convents, Tantes, or
aunts. The idea is French, of course.’
“Wery French,” I say, knowingly. -
My Funny Friend informs me that all I have to do there is to enter
the place, see the chief, swear I have an Aunt in England, and then
...; myself in a book kept for the purpose, name, age, weight, and
so forth.
“But,” I object with a lurking suspicion of my Funny Friend's
truthfulness, “why not go to the Embassy "
“All right,” says GRIgg, shrugging his shoulders, “try the
Embassy. Do, oh, do. Try it. Be sent off from one clerk to
another, be perpetually told that the Ambassador's out, or that his
Chief Secretary’s not in, or that his Under Secretary has just gone
home, and in fact be kept hanging about the place for two weeks,
until at length the police begin to suspect you, and you actually incur
what you are taking the greatest care to avoid. Oh, yes, try the
Embassy, do !” -
p;" is so energetically sarcastic about it that he must be serious.
o—Wer:
Nearly ten o'clock. Dark and cold...Wind roaring out at sea.
We are taken down to the embarking place, and, descend dank,
dark steps, as if we were secretly escaping from England, instead of
going boldly for a pleasure trip. -
GRIGG says he was born to be a sailor, and whistles a hornpipe.
He asks the mariner who has us in charge, whether he is sure the
* maintop's deck is all taut, whereat the mariner grunts
Surilly.
GRIgG does make me laugh sometimes.
He does now; , but I am glad to laugh at anything under such
miserably depressing circumstances.
At last . allow us to cross a shaky plank, and go on board.
In a second GRIGG has disappeared suddenly down somewhere. I
don't know where to. I am carrying so manythings that I can't do
anything suddenly, except drop them.
GRIgG reappears. He has collared a berth, he says. He adds,
always do that first when you get on board, so as to have a place to
stow F. things safely.
I'll go and do it. He points out that I’m too late to get one; but
if I can find any room in his, without tumbling his things about too
much, I may make use of it. In travelling my Funny Friend becomes
my Selfish Friend. -
When I come on deck again, I find him comfortably seated, that is, as
comfortably as can be under the circumstances, about the centre of
the vessel.
“You’re all settled, I see,” I observe, envying him.
“Yes,” he answers. “You ought always to do that at once on
board a steamer.” He makes no offer to me of a seat, though if he
took his legs down, there'd be lots of room.
The Captain, I think it’s the Captain, comes up and observes the
train’s a little late. -
I say “Yes it is,” taking his word for it, and then inquire as gaily
as I can, with about as much of a dare-devil and cheery nautical air as
would suit the Apothecary in, Romeo, and Juliet, “What sort of a
passage do you think we shall have f" -
“Well,” * the Captain, looking up at where the sky is supposed
to be—“Well, I think it’ll be a dusty passage.” -
“Oh, you think it’ll be dusty P” asks GRigg, who has been whist-
ling “Rule Britannia.” - -
“Yes,” answers the Captain, in a decided tone this time, “it’ll be
dusty”. And walks away.
This information appears to depress even GRIGG. For myself, I
prepare myself for the worst. I find a narrow strip of a seat round
the corner of where GRIGG is lying, and sit down, thoughtfully. I am
not ºn troubled with presentiments; but I do not like the Captain's
WordS.
We are in for “a dusty passage.”
A Rude Russian.
THE Russian official organ says—and rudely is it said,
“The ARchbishop or KAMTschatka, INNocent, well known as a converter of the
heathen, has been appointed to the Metropolitan See of Moscow.'
We have always been told that the Moscow folks were the most
ious in Holy Russia, and we do not approve of the above implicatiºn.
º: would have been proper enough had the writer been referring to the
appointment of the Bishop of LICHFIELD.
LITERARY GOSSIP.
It will not be surprising if the Americans, justly proud of the writer
of The History of the Netherlands, assert that there is no other living
historian worth reading, and quote SHAKSPEARE on their side, because
he says—“MoTLEy’s the only wear.”

WRONG IN THE MAYNE-
- s TR,-Permit me through your
- º sº to ask the %io;
questions:-
Where is the humble rate-
payer to take his daily exercise,
and may he deduct the expense
of his revolver from the police
rate P
The circumstances are as fol-
lows:—We all know how ad-
mirable are our police arrange-
ments, and what a debt of gra-
titude we owe to SIR RICHARD
MAYNE for perfecting them;
but there remains the uncom-
fortable fact that, even before
the Fenians took to blowing
us up, it was unsafe to walk
- - through the streets of London,
owing to the thieves, roughs, and garotters.
.The only secure promenade for the ratepayer was the sewers. Alas,
Sir, these are now closed to him; every passage and hole is guarded or
locked, I am informed, on account of #: Fenians.

HOITY! TOITY
An Original Poem for the Infant Minds of MAstER John and Miss
CoLUMBIA.
How now, my dear children, it’s always the way,
ou can't be contented with innocent play;
But you wrangle and squabble, with tempers too high,
And then there’s a scoſd, and a sulk, and a cry.
What, are there no games you can take a delight in,
But sneering, and jibing, and scoffing, and fighting?
I’m weary § telling you, time after time,
That you’re cousins, and therefore each quarrel’s a crime.
John, do what she asks you, no angry replies,
You're older than she, and you should be more wise;
And QolusſBIA, my dear, don't speak pettish and tart,
If he’s surly sometimes, you’ve a place in his heart.
You two, well descended, well fed, and well taught,
You should set an example, yes, that’s what you ought,
Remember how much on your conduct depends,
You’re Christians and cousins—there, kiss and be friends.
LYRA. INELEGANTIARUM.
MR. Boosey, the eminent music-publisher, has been defending him.
self, or rather his ballad concerts, in the Musical World. . We are not
going into the controversy—we think the concerts excessively pleasant
ones—and the gentleman on the other side is perfectly capable of con-
ducting his own case. But we are going to assure MR. Boosey that
our experience of song-composing is not in this wise :—
“The truth is that verses are rarely read by the publisher, and the way in hich
they escape his scrutiny is easy to explain. The poet gets hold of a popular com-
poser in a weak moment (perhaps over a cigar) and asks him to set some words to
music. The composer, wishing to do ºt friend a turn, finds a tune for the words
and plays it over to a publisher. The tune is liked and the song published. It
afterwards leaks out that there is a poet hiding himself behind the com r. Then
comes the publisher's grief. The poet, whº is of as much importance to the composer
as the frame-maker to the painter, give Wºmself airs, and takes all the credit of the
song to himself.” \
Now this, we repeat, is not our experience. Extraordinarily brilliant
and popular composers come to us (whether we are smoking or not is
nothing to the purpose—most likely we are, we generally are) and say,
“O, my dear boy, do sit down for a quarter of an hour, and knock us
off some verses one isn't ashamed to set. The batches of bosh which
the publishers send me are enough to make a fellow tear his hair. Just
#: here.” And then he pulls out a lot of MS., and reads first
nes :-
“The stars are smiling on the beans.”
“I knew thee by that gay perfume.”
“Pop your dear letter inside the old tree.”
“Tears along my brow may trickle.”
“Come where crocus-berries glisten.”
“Jump, little heart, for Johnny comes.” .
And a dozen more of the same beauty; and then in a plaintive way
he demands something else. Perhaps he gets it, perhaps he doesn't.
But we never hide ourselves behind him, for reasons, and we never
take all the credit of the song, or any of it, inasmuch as provided song-
words have plenty of open vowels, and no elisions, and mean as little
as possible, they answer the composer's purpose, and there’s no ques-
tion about credit. The comparison between the frame-maker and the
words-writer is not quite apposite. A picture can exist without a
frame, but a song can’t exist without words, except when a MENDELs-
soHN writes it, and we are not likely to have MENDELssohns while
fºulevatiºn are not ashamed to push the songs of the music-
8.
But, as the late MR. STRICKLAND used to say in Uncle Foozle, “Lor',
after all, what does it matter?”
—
A Warning.
THough Hampstead’s the place to ruralise, it labours under the
disadvantage of being sadly inaccessible from London. A friend of
Mr. Punch, who lives there, says that there are two lines of omnibuses
which will convey him to the Bank; that from the Swiss Cottage,
known as the City Atlas line; and that aid Camden Town and Totten-
ham Court Road, which may be called, from its tardiness, the City
at last line. He has hit the difference to a “t.”

STARVATION IN THE MIDST OF TURTLE.
DIED on Sunday the 19th instant, in Holloway Prison, Michael Lyons,
aged twenty-seven, from previous starvation. According to a contemporary:-
“It is stated that 51 persons, men, women, and children, were committed to the City prison
at Holloway in three days by one Alderman last week. They had been found destitute in the
streets of the City by the police, and they had been taken into custody on the charge of begging.
For this they were sentenced to an average punishment of from 14 to 21 days' imprisonment,
with hard labour, on a diet of dry bread and gruel.”
Were they, then, a set of impostors? Not so :—
“Of the whole 51 the money found in their pockets amounted, it is said upon authority
which there is no reason to doubt, to the sum of 1d. That coin was found on the person of
a blind man. They contained amongst their number representatives, not only of every form of
misery, but almost of every class. One was a stockbroker who at one time had been possessed of
a fortune of more than £100,000. He came to grief through having invested too confidently in
Spanish bonds. . . . One little child of two years of age was locked up with its mother. The
whole fifty-one were more or less suffering from starvation; thirty-four of them were in a state of
physical exhaustion from want of food. Young women were seen to stagger from weakness when
entering the prison.”
The refinement of some readers would be outraged by the publication of the
£º to the foregoing description. It goes into surgical and . entomological
etails.
The deceased MICHAEL Lyons was one of those twenty-one miserable creatures
committed, for begging, to imprisonment and hard labour in Holloway Prison.
“He was fairly exhausted from want,” deposed MR. WEATHERHEAD, the governor
of the prison. “He got six ounces of bread and a pint of gruel one hour after he
came in.” It was not a savoury meal, but “when he got his food heate it raven-
ously, like a man suffering from want.” He got bread and gruel; but he did not
get a glass of brandy, which might have saved his life; and he died of serous
effusion on the brain. So, according to medical evidence, decided a coroner's jury,
adding that they considered “it would be advisable that the governor of the
prison should have the power of altering the diet of prisoners whenever he sees
a necessity for doing so.” As capital punishment has ceased to be, the punish-
ment of robbery, the jury probably thought that even a thief had better not be
suffered to perish like MicăAEL Lyons.
In a letter in the Times MR. Oke denies that any persons were committed from
the Mansion House for begging; but seven, he says, were
brought there. The Alderman, therefore, whoever he was
that sentenced 51 to imprisonment, hard labour, and
meagre diet, may, in so doing, be presumed to have been
a free agent, unboundby law. So the law, in this case, need
not be called barbarous and unchristian. Does the Alder-
man, however, who administered it, think that, had
Dives had the option of sending LAzARus to the House of
Correction, instead of suffering him to lie at his gate-in
the state of some of the poor companions of Lyons
—and if DIVEs had accordingly punished Lazarus
with imprisonment and hard labour Dives would precisely
have done his duty instead of neglecting it, and that this
would have made the whole difference in the ultimate lot
of Dives? If the story of Dives and LAzARus is a myth,
if it has no moral at all, well and good, or, as some will
say, ill and evil. Then, maintain a Workhouse System,
which drives the destitute to starve in the streets. Then
abolish the law which makes suicide a crime: let every-
body who is miserable go and hang himself. Then, no
poor rates; no expenditure on paupers! Also, no church-
rates, and no waste of money in the payment, to the
amount of one single farthing, of any clergyman!

HYMNS OF HATE.
A cuRIous little controversy is going on in Shropshire, as we learn
from the Oswestry Advertiser, upon a feature in hymnology, and as this
is a typical quarrel, likely to be repeated in many a county, Mr. Punch,
the great Arbiter, steps in to “stint the strife.”
The question is whether a Christian ought to feel comfortable in
singing a hymn in honour of his own religion, when he does not in-
clude in his singing some abuse of other creeds.
Those who take the affirmative side, urge that the cause of religion
is not likely to be much served by congregations joining in this sort
ºing—a verse from a hymn of John WESLEY. Appeal is made to
ºn to
“Let Mahomet's imposture end:
Bºok superstition's Papal chain,
and the proud scoffer's rage restrain.”

SPIRITUALISM AND STRETCHING.
THE writer of a letter in the Spiritual Magazine for January accuses
Punch of gross, misrepresentation, perpetrated in a notice of certain
“Spirit-Poetry.”, He-if not she—omits to mention the number of
Punch in which that notice appeared. It was the number for Novem-
ber 23, 1867. So now, any intelligent reader of the Spiritual Magazine
is enabled to compare the notice with the accusation.
The Spiritual Magazine also contains a statement by an eye-witness,
who doubtless believes he saw what he says he saw, that MR. Home,
the Medium, was, at certain séances, elongated and shortened—elon.
rated on one occasion to the height of from six to seven feet. Many
eople are satisfied that.MR. Home stretched a good deal in his auto-
iography; but few will credit him with the capability of stretching
ze a piece of india-rubber.

56 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 1, 1868.
AND THIS IS THE WAY HISTORY IS WRITTEN 1
ThE Mark Lane Express says that LoRD HILL's fat Eland, which
attracted so much attention at the Islington Christmas Cattle Show,
has been slaughtered and eaten; that a sirloin of the beef was placed
on the table of the Farmers’ Club dinner at the Salisbury Hotel, when
those who partook of it pronounced it to be capital beef; that the
Eland was slaughtered by MessRs. BANNISTER, who bought it, at a
low price, there being no º for such strange meat.
Within a day or two after this paragraph was published in the Pall
Mall Gazette, MR. BANNISTER writes to say that no Eland sirloin
appeared at the dinner in question; that the Eland was not purchased
or slaughtered by him; and that the Eland, to the best of his belief,
has never been purchased, slaughtered, or eaten at all.
If the best history be the newspaper, as CoBDEN used to say it was,
what are we to think of this specimen of historical material? No
wonder Lowe would banish History from education, as being made up
of contradictions, if our “best possible instructors” are to be made to
give themselves the lie—the, lie circumstantial, too—thus, from one
day to the next. And if we can be thus crammed apropos of meat,
what may we not expect àpropos of measures and men?
MR. LOWE IN “TOM AND JERRY.”
, Illustrating the error of hasty generalisation, MR. Lowe said, in
his instructive speech at Liverpool:—
“If a man rode his horse against a wheelbarrow, and it tumbled down, that
horse would be frightened at every wheelbarrow it saw—because it had generalised
too hastily.”
As the horse generalises too hastily, so does the ass. What a
blessing to society it would be if MR. Lowe could make every donkey
see the absurdity of so, doing. What a bore for all the impostors and
charlatans, and especially the medical quacks, who thrive on the
donkeys only because they are prone to hasty generalisation! ...A
donkey has been persuaded to take MoRison’s or HollowAY's pills,
and, after having taken them, has felt himself relieved of the complaint
for which he took them. So, whenever he feels unwell, he always has
recourse to those particular pills, believing that they will be sure to
relieve him again. This too hasty generalisation is at last, perhaps,
the death of the donkey. --- - -
MR. Robert Lowe has exposed illogical reasoning so, well, that
although he repudiates the logic of the schools, instead of being com-
monly called Bob Lowe, he might be called Bob Logic.
PROGRESS OF HUMANITY.
The Post's correspondent at Paris says:—
“The military mania is a contagious malady, not confined to Europe alone. The
EMPERoR of Morocco has just decreed the formation of a regular army, to be com-
manded for the most part by European officers, Inore especially Spanish.”
Christian Sovereigns having set the example of “bloated armaments,”
a Mahometan Potentate is now “at it” too—but for what purpose
Whom does the EMPEROR OF MoRocco want to leather?

Had its roots in accurs'd civil strife,
Was fed in the foray's red ruin,
And the camp-harpy's war of the knife.

But while brand and noose it evaded,

Brazen-browed, bloody-handed and callous,
Took the Fenian mask for its screen;
Found poor Irish pockets to plunder,
When the Camp-vulture's quarry was gone,
And mimicked the patriot's thunder,
As the soldier's garb erst it put on.
In one point alone they’re Milesian,
These blots on the brave Celtic race:
To the cause that deplores their adhesion,
Destruction they bring with disgrace.
When their hate to the Saxon they’d show men,
At the Fenians, it is, they strike hard,
And seeking to blow up their foemen,
Hoist themselves with their murd’rous petard.

Now, MR. TRoLLOPE is the recognised authority as to what girls
ought to do in the way of marriage—he is the Judge in the Marriage
Court, a SIR. J. P. WILDE reversed—and his decisions have the Nº.

PERSONS WHO PLEASE THEMSELWES.
Of course, Mr. Punch, you have read a letter, pleading the cause of
certain outcasts, which the distinguished surgeon, MR. SKEY, the other
day wrote to the Times. If any of your readers happen to be acquainted
with any prigs and any prudes, endowed, however, with some share of
good feeling and good sense, f hope they will try and induce them to
attend to the appeal put forth, for their enlightenment, by M.R. SKEY.
But, Sir, there is one little argument in MR. SKEY’s above-mentioned
letter, to which I must demur. He asks :-
“Can it be supposed that the society of their own sex is a sufficient incentive to
extravagance in dress?"
The answer to this question expected by MR. SKEY of course is–No.
But my reply is Yes. More than that, I say that, not only can it be
supposed that the society of their own sex is a sufficient incentive to
extravagance of dress on the part of most Persons of the sex referred
to by SKEY, but also that such is in general actually the case.
The great majority of them, I am sure, dress solely with a view
to the effect, which their clothes will produce, on others, who are
naturally qualified to wear similar clothes. I don't imagine that effect
to be intended to be always, or even usually, admiration or, pleasure.
Astonishment, I should rather think. Perhaps it does not disappoint
expectation when it is envy. -
R. SKEY represents “the love of finery and dress” characteristic
of Persons, as “a taste implanted in them by nature for purposes that
make them attractive to our sex, for whom they live and move.” Yes;
but it has been diverted, or perverted, from those purposes. Why did
Persons persist so long in wearing crinoline? It was detested, it was
ridiculed by all mankind. Why is their evening dress generally so low as
to be grotesque, and solong as to be apparently intended to conceal splay
feet? as it probably was by the Person, whoever she was, who invented
it, or for whom it was invented. We, Sir—I trust I may say we–like
to see the Person decorated and adorned in such wise as to set off
every one of her personal advantages, and enhance them, all and
sundry, in the highest possible degree. A quantity of fine clothes, which
might, for aught we can discern, drape a stake or a pole, excites no
emotion in our minds but pity for the wearer, and more pity for the
man who will have to pay for it all. The majority of Persons dress as
Fashion bids them, and would not on any account dress otherwise to
make themselves ever so attractive to any one of the sex which is MR.
SKEY's, and yours, and mine. Why do they still wear those pigtails?
I mean chignons. -
. However, Fashion has certainly done one graceful thing for Persons,
In ºf them their gº." walking-dresses, at once elegant and sen-
sible. Too pretty and too reasonable to last, I am afraid, Mr. Punch.
It is too probable that we shall soon see distended skirts again ob-
structing, the pavement, or flowing trains, once more sweeping it.
Some "ºf ersons continue to go about with hoops under their
gowns. They are accustomed, as you have observed, to cram omni-
buses, and make them stuffy, and wipe their muddy skirts as they go
in and out on people's, knees. A true lady, if hoops were fashionable
for a . carriage-dress, would relinquish them if she had to ride in
a public vehicle.
he remarks in MR. SKEY’s excellent letter about female extrava-
gance in dress—obiter dicta-are quite true for their purpose, only the
cause of that extravagance is not that which he fondly assigns. Such,
at least, is the opinion of your old friend, SILENUs.
P.S.. I am stopping at the Graces.
A Graphic Symphony.
TRANSGENDENTALISM in ideas of the power of sound has been sup-
posed to be represented as pushed to absurdity in the notion of ... music
descriptive of a man's going abroad, and changing his religion.”
What, then, do you say to a composition performed the other evening
at MR. BARNEY's Concert, namely MENDElssohn’s “Reformation
Symphony?” For that describes people staying at home and changing
their religion, which it is not easier to conceive capable of being
musically described than going abroad and doing so.

58- PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 8, 1868.
BEFORE THE SCENES.
EveR was I behind the
scenes in my life, ex-
cept once, in dim and
distant youth, at the
Theatre Royal and
Sole Magnustown,
long since trans-
formed, without the
magic touch of Har-
lequin's wand, into a
Pickle Warehouse.
If I were to meet, in
my walk down the
Strand to-morrow, all
the actors and ac-
tresses, all the lessees
and managers of the
various Metropolitan
Theatres, there is not
one of them who
would know me. I
have never written,
or adapted, or trans-
lated, or edited any-
thing for the Stage.
I am merely an occa-
sional playgoer, easy
to please, mostly a
Pittite, not hope-
lessly inconsolable if the piece I pay to see is of foreign, extraº-
tion, with a fanciful idea that I can tell pretty well by the title
of a play whether it will have a long run or soon drop, with no
tº: recollections of the great performers of gone-by days, with
a memory which does not punctiliously remind me that I have seen
this situation or discovered that plot twenty times before, with entire
ignorance of the French stage, saving me from contrast and compa-
rison; and with intermittent resolves to cease being even an occa-
sional playgoer, and become a total, playforegoer, for the following
(amongst other) reasons, which I shall set out with all the solemnity
of a Tory Peer’s protest:-
Because I object to crowds and crushes, gloomy vaults and passages,
and constricted entrances and exits.
Because I object to narrow and hard seats, alternate benches with-
out backs, bad ventilation, and itinerant vendors of lemonade and
stout—stout and lemonade.
Because I object, when I take ELEANOR and ELEANOR's sister to the
superior parts of the house, and secure seats, to be fined (fee for
booking) for paying ready money; and consider that my butcher and
baker might as reasonably increase the price of their goods when my
dealings with them are for cash.
Because I object, after I have paid a stiffish sum for my seats, with
the booking-fee in addition, to be further plundered for the benefit of
the functionary who shows me to my box; and feel that if this is right,
I ought, the next time I accompany my wife to MEssRs. WINCEY AND
PopLING's, to give a gratuity to the young man who hands us chairs,
and tempts ELEANOR with the new Abyssinian jacket.
Because I object to be charged twopence or more for a playbill, and
ºjºple enough to think I ought to have one for nothing, as at the
pht.
Because I object to pay for the temporary custody of my overcoat.
All which objections I put on record, with a sturdy conviction that
any Manager who would abolish these grievances and abate these
nuisances, might realise a swift and substantial fortune.
This is the prelude—the overture—now for the performance. One
moment more before you ring the bell. What capital have I to
start with as a critic? Have I studied the history of the Greek
theatre P Do I know anything about the unities of the Drama? Can
I speak of mysteries and miracle-plays, masques, and º: Am
I versed in the annals of the English Stage, from the Globe to the
Alhambra, from SHAKs PEARE and BURBAGE to BULWER-Lytton and
Kean, with ready references to BETTERTON, MRs. BRACEGIRDLE,
QUEEN ELIZABETh, MAsTER BETTY, and the O. P. riots? Do I even
know the meaning of the commonest stage directions P Can I, who
am going to say something about Clown and Columbine, Harlequin and
Pantaloon, reveal the origin of Pantomime, and follow its chequered
(and spangled) career, from RICH to GRIMALDI, and downwards to
FLEXMoRE and BoLENo Any answer to these interrogatories? No;
at least none that would satisfy a Court of Equity. Then run the risk,
and ring the bell, and let us get as near as we can to the front of the
pit of Drury Lane.
I have great advantages as a seer of Pantomimes. All mechanical
forces are unknown wonders to me. I cannot tell how any of the tricks
are done, and I don’t want to be told. Even the resounding smacks
and slaps Clown and Pantaloon deal each other, are in my eyes so many
savage and dangerous assaults... I may get rather tired, but then Jack
the Giant-killer or The Babes in the Wood was not prepared for my
amusement (forty last birthday), but for the entertainment of these
two young gentlemen sitting by my side, who laugh and clap, and roll
and writhe with delight, the more Clown & Co. cuff and whack and
thump and thrust, each other. (I declare there are grown-up people
in the auditory, laughing immoderately, but only, of course, as an
example to the children.)
If I were writing beautiful poetry, and not plain prose, I should
make “cleverly”, chime with Beverley (I shall not be surprised to
hear that it has been done already), not merely as a rhymical conve.
nience, but as a just and sincere compliment to the scenic artist of
Drury Lane. If any wayfarers will adopt me as their theatrical
MURRAY, I should advise them to :* the Giant's Causeway and
the Cornish Coast, and the Road to St. Ives, which it may surprise them
to hear are nearer home than is generally supposed-in fact, no farther
off-than Drury Lane! If an excursion into Fairy Land, to which
country no Handbook has at present been ilāh. be preferred, the
Golden Garden of the Peerless Pool will be found a *|†. prome-
made, and the Fairy Boudoir prove a bower of bliss. If I may indulge
myself in, a good, hearty wish, it will be that, the “Fruit Fairies”
may getttheir des(s)erts for their picturesque ...; and although
old Pater Christmassis-defunct, and not particularly lamented by me,
I should not rebel against a second visit to a Christmas Kirmess during
a Frost, or be put to torture by re-seeing the Grand Flambeaua Dance.
From Drury Lane to Covent Garden is not a far, cry. The Fates,
should I not rather say the Fata Morgana & have been propitious to
Covent Garden. MR. MATT MoRGAN's Realms of White Diamond is a
brilliant success, and his enchanting Seasons as good as Thomson's.
They may be “Fleeting,” but they will certainly not be short-lived.
Those who are of opinion that The Åº Greenwood is a glade of glad-
ness will signify the same in the usual manner. MR HAwes CRAVEN,
you need have no fears; a forest of hands would, I am sure, be gladly
raised in your favour.
Whatever hesitation you may have, MR. FRED PAYNE, I can have
none in pronouncing MR. W. H. PAYNE and yourself to be the Premier
Pantomimists, and Prime Ministers of fun and frolic, notably in The
State Bedroom in the Baron's Castle, which with its romantic four-poster
ought to be on a poster all over London, surrounded by little robins,
and merry men in Lincoln green under the command of CAPTAIN
SHERIDAN, of the “Robin Hoods.” . And, MR. HARRY, you are
certainly the pleasantest of Clowns, being as neat as a new pin, and
never offending by vulgarity.
I venture on one final word of remonstrance to the two Sovereign
Houses. Set a good example to your minor brethren. Bring out
next 3. pantomimes as good as, or if possible, better than the two
now being performed, but do not pervert them into an “excellent
advertising medium.”
THE GREAT CONVERT.
The Catholic papers intimate that Rome is about to gain another
convert of so much influence and importance as to make the operation
a grander success than any of the recent manipulations.
Who is it? ask the Protestant papers.
Answers are given at random. Among the suggestions are-
The Bishop of SALISBURY.
MR. Buckston E.
MR. MARTIN F. TUPPER.
BERNAL OSBORNE.
CHANG.
The EMPEROR NAPOLEON.
GeoRGE FRANcis TRAIN.
W. H. PAYNE with his Son, Harlequin, thrown in.
EARL Russell.
MR. John BRIGHT.
MACE.
BEALEs.
But it is left to Mr. Punch to reveal the mystery. The fatal blow has
been struck at last. The work of the Reformation is undone. Pro-
testantism is moribund. The Papists have been and done it. They
have got
WHALLEY!
We shall come out in black next week.
Quite as Likely.
THE increase of the French army to 12,000,000 men by the new Bill,
will, according to the Imperial organs, conduce to peace, by leaving
France to enjoy her “ otium cum dignitate.” But how if it converts
her otium into braggadocium ?

ARMADILLO.
A SONG OF BLOATED ARMAMENTS.
A QUEER little animal there’s to be seen
In the Regent's Park Gardens, where you have all been:
Armadillo, Armadillo, he’s armed like good fellows,
In mere self-defence from the wild beast that bellows.
His back is protected with armour of scale,
... And he runs about safe clad in that coat of mail.
Armadillo, &c.
O rare Armadillo, how well it would be,
Were all of our neighbours armed only like thee!
Armadillo, &c. -
If they would but just leave one another alone,
They’d want safeguard not even so much as thine own.
Ar 0;
There’s Italy, fain herown business to mind,
And Prussia, with & y; likewise inclined.
O, &C.
And for the same reason in quiet remain, , .
By all means would Austria, Russia, and Spain.
Armadillo, &c.
In the whole world there’s no one that wants to advance
One step in the way of encroachment on France,
Armadillo, &c.
France will arm to the teeth, not with rivals to cope,
But to fight, if required, for the crown of the Pope.
Armadillo, &c.
So poor France with taxation must sheep-like be shorn,
And hersons from their homes by Conscription see torn.
Armadillo, &c.
France must pay, France must bleed, that her Ruler Elect
May the Romans keep under the yoke they’d reject.
Armadillo, &c.
If the Pope were but left his own rule to enforce,
France herself could relieve, and us all, too, of course.
Armadillo, &c.
The example by France set would act like a charm,
By disarming herself she’d all Europe disarm.
Armadillo, &c.
DOING THE CHAMBERLAIN'S OFFICE.
My LoRD CHAMBERLAIN,
. You R Lordship cannot be much of a playgoer, or else you
have very liberal ideas of public decency. If you erase impro-
prieties of the pen from the authors’, MSS., you allow pruriency of
dress to make amends for your excisions. If the no dressing of
actresses increases as it has done for the last two or three years, the
Pantomimes and Burlesques of next season will become exceedingly
costless, so far as the costume of the ladies is concerned, and our
fruiterer, MR. Lewis SolomoN, of Covent Garden Market, will no
doubt be appointed costumier en chef to all the º theatres in
London. No modest woman will be able to take her daughters to the
theatre, if this and some other French innovations are permitted to
extend; and the beautiful scenery of MR. BEVERLEY and MR. MATT
MoRGAN will hardly compensate for the indecent exposure of poor
wretched ballet, girls, balanced on slotes, or dangled from wires, an
who are compelled to submit to such indignities for the sake of an
engagement. "My LorD CHAMBERLAIN, }. are not doing your duty.
Should HER GRAcious MAJESTY again honour the theatres with her
presence, she will certainly give your Lordship a wigging. F
OOZLE.
Bettering the Instruction.
“WHEN your sons ask for bread do you give them a stone **
Was a question once asked of the Jews.
Would Bumble's mouth shut, if that question were put,
And the querist an answer refuse
No ; by way of reply, with a wink of his eye,
“To the yard,” he would say, “stir your bones:
There we gives the unfed, when they asks us for bread,
Not one stone, but a whole heap of stones.”
TA RIDDLE FROM ABYssinIA.—What is the difference between the
AGsHUM GoBAZIE and Mr. Punch f The former is the “Prince of
Wag,” the latter the Prince of Wags.
PUNCH'S REVIEW.
KELLY's Post Office Directory for 1868.
ConscIENTIOUSNEss has caused some delay in the appearance of this
Review, for, unlike many of his critical brethren, Mr. º: invariably
peruses the whole of a work before judging it. We have now read the
Post Office Directory through, from beginning to end, and unhesitatingly
pronounce a verdict of approval. There is a lucidity of style, which at
once enables the reader to grasp the author's full meaning; and if the
language be epigrammatic almost to a fault, that is not a fault on which
Mr. Punch can be severe. The amount of information which the
volume contains is colossal; indeed MR. KELLY may be called the
Colossus of Roads, also of streets, squares, terraces, avenues, lanes,
broadways, alleys, circuses, paragons, ovals, parades, fields, villas,
buildings, gardens, courts, places, chambers, crescents, vales, gates,
hills, parks, inns, rows, walks, houses, flats, cotta
other localities in which the population of the Province of London is
to be found—and it will be found if MR. KELLY be taken as a guide.
It does not occur to us to add anything more to this, puff, except
that the ponderous yet handy volume seems just the thing to shy at a
Fenian if he comes within reach, and it is our fixed intention to
launch it at the head of the first who shall approach the Presence—the
i.º for the coroner, and his address will certainly be found in
the book.
NO BISHOP OF EXETER HALL.
WE fear that the new Bishop of Lichfield will not be popular in
|Exeter Hall. Read this:-
“Bishop SEEwyn does not like ‘missionary meeting anecdotes." At a meeting
at Coventry the other day, he said, “After more than twenty-five years spent upon
the islands of the Pacific, her could give them plenty of anecdotes if he thought
well. He especially hated anecdotes which were called ‘interesting. People
wanted to hearinteresting anecdotes from the same maudlin sentimentality which
induced them to read sensation novels.’”
“Interesting anecdotes about the dear heathen.” That phrase, the
darling of the Dames de la Halle d’Ereter, proscribed, and by a Bishop !
We do not think that DR. SELwyN will get an engagement for the
May entertainments. What, not a single story? Not one about a
dear New Zealander, who, a year ago, proposed to eat his grandmother,
and now, through tracts, carries her about on his shoulders, singing
hymns : Nothing to bring out those curious noises alternating between
a sympathetic murmur and indignant groan, which used to accompany
tales of negroes, flogged to death in thousands for keeping the Sabbath,
and which now proceed when there is talk of Jamaica? No, and the
Bishop may do very well for the Black Country, but evidently is not
the man for Philadelphion.
SAD NEWS FROM ROME.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
WHAT do you think has happened . Such a frightful piece of
news | I read it in the Times, so of course it must be true :-
“I shall conclude my Roman report with the last sapient act of the Government,
which has been to prohibit chignons, and regulate the toilette of ladies in church.”
“Sapient act!” Only fancy calling this a sapient act 1 Imagine if
the British Government were to imitate the Roman, and were to forbid
our wearing chignons when we go to Church But LoRD DERBY is a
gentleman, besides being so clever, and I’m sure would never dream of
doing such a stupid thing. l’ve heard that his Reform Act is not
thought a very wise one, but surely it would be the very height of
* compared with such a “sapient act” as that described
above.
My feelings are too strong for me to say much more about it, and so
I will remain, Yours, most indignantly,
GEORGIANA Gus H.
P.S.. I suppose we next shall hear that ladies are obliged to go to
Church in their old bonnets.
PP.S. Sad news for the dear Ritualists, this information must have
been | No lady now will dream of going over to Rome, if she is to
take her chignon off before she goes to Church.
Freedom in France.
“L’Empire c’est la pair,” we were once told. It hath not appeared.
What France has got by the Empire, besides the restriction of the
Press, is the Army Organisation Bill. France, whatever may be said
by her Emperor, may now, for her own part, say, “L’Empire c’est la
Conscription.”

HOW IS IT DONE 2
WRITING on distress in London a competent authority says, “There
are no Jews suffering. A Jew mendicant is as rare as a black swan or
a white elephant. The Hebrews relieve their own poor.”
Just so. We were thinking of advising all distressed persons to
become Jews, only that the Hebrews. do not care about proselytes.
However, it may come to that. Meantime, would DR, ADLER, or some
other eminent Jew, tellus how the relief is managed? The Christian
way, we should tell him, is to establish twenty or thirty separate
associations, which by the natural laws of rivalry, become antagonistic,
will not work together, and relieve one street a dozen times while they
neglect the next altogether. Moreover, they preach to the hungry.
How are things managed in Jewry P
Since the above was written, there is news of a Reform. The
Societies, weary of impostors and blundering, amalgamate, and adopt *
system. Good. They have learned something from Judaea. le
recalcitrant East End Mission stands out for the right of giving tracts
as well as money, to .# beggars. We recommend the public to
save the Mission the second trouble.
The Last.
If a tall man held a most responsible situation in a Bank, why
would, his description, given by a Scotchman, be the name of an

warn him of his impending doom; but if he meglects counsel he will
have only himself to thank when he tries to combº his hair: some
morning, and finds that he has no head.
HOW TO CHECK POACHING.
BEING a good sportsman, and not a mere game-butcher, Mr. Punch
is pleased to see that the Farmers’ Club at Hexham have passed a
resolution that big battues are a nuisance which ought to be abated.
If every farmers' club in England had the sense to do the same, no doubt
a good effect might be produced upon the game butchers. What is sport
to them is death, not merely to the birds and animals they slaughter, but
to the crops which these same birds and animals consume, and for
which no compensation, really compensates the farmer. . Great game
preservation leads to wicked waste of food, and so far from making
sport to a true sportsman, it destroys it. To shoot tame pheasants as
; rise by dozens, scores, or hundreds, at “warm corners” of a
covert, isi, neither nerve nor skill, nor * quality of º
and only lazy, idle fools can fancy that there is any pleasure in it.
Then think at what a cost this pleasure is enjoyed. Not merely waste
of crops, but waste of life is caused by it. here hares and rabbits
swarm, there poachers, too, abound; and labourers are tempted to
jeave their ploughs and hurdles to look after their snares, and so are
led to worse than waste of time in prison. -
Game preservers surely might, help somewhat to check poaching,
if they only sold their pheasants, let us say at sixpence each, and thus
e them so cheap as to be hardly worth the taking. But so long as
game is sold as dearly as it is, and so long as game preservers let their
keepers purchase eggs and live birds from the poachers, there is very
little hope that we shall see our prisons emptied of them.

Subterranean Spelling.
Wr heartily approve of the teaching bestowed upon the men, em:

the accuracy of the Directors' spelling. At a dinner the other day,
the employés were told to remember the three S's, Signals, Safety,
Sivility. But the intention was good.
the dangerous classes, we could never do without policemen.
| . The efficiency of the police requires that they should be duly orga-
nised. For this purpose it must be borne in mind that though police-
men are combatants, they are not such combatants as soldiers. They
have to act not against masses of enemies, but against single foemen;
their warfare is battle with individual villains—the swell-mobsman, the
thief, the footpad, the garotter. The organisation which they require
is such as would qualify them not º to encounter such antagonists,
but to keep them out of the field. Of late this object has been imper-
fectly accomplished. The malefactors have had things very much their
ownway. To be sure the police are not nearly numerous enough.
|The ant fellows, have not had their numbers augmented in any
|adequate, ratio to the increase of population. But also there appears
to have been more military drilling of them than was necessary, and
not enough of that special training which is necessary to render them
sufficiently sharp in looking after those “characters” who ought to
be known to them. Hence not only have very many of Her Majesty's
subjects been plundered, throttled and stunned by an ..unmolested
felonry, but a monstrous outrage has been committed, which ought to
have been prevented. Had the police force been in a proper state of
efficiency, the prison and the houses in Clerkenwell would º:
not have been blown up the other day by the Fenians, whilst the
Fenians' own plot would.
The activity needful for bringing the police up to the mark cannot
be expected at this date of an official career solong as their present
Chief's. . It is time that career should close, with adequate acknow-
ledgment of merits past. The day will doubtless come when the
nobleness of the constabulary profession will have been so well recog:

Commissioner of Police, for distinguished services, to the Peerage.
That is to say, if the country have no war to carry on, like the Abyssinian
so that Parliament will not refuse to vote him the means which he will
require to sustain the dignity of a nobleman. In the mean time SIR
RichałD. MAYNE might be invited to retire on a pension, the full
amount of his salary.

John Bull (the paper) takes the liberty of lecturing the QUEEN for
the patronage HER MAJESTY bestows on the Kirk of Scotland, and it
intimates that the Sovereign is little better than a Dissenter. That
charge is too awful to be spoken about. But Punch may be allowed
to remind the John Bull that if the QUEEN did not when in Scotland
Wºº. the Kirk, she would be not only almost, but quite a Dissenter.
e wonder whether John BULL can realise the fact that in Paris he
would be a Foreigner. It may be very humiliating, but England
isn't Everywhere. English persons would make fewer mistakes if
they could manage to acquire this idea.

A CERTAIN CURE.

[Fred has no idea, but under present circumstances feels the Bath-chairs are doing wonders for him/
A PLEA FOR TIGHT LACING.
IN The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine a controversy has for
some time been going on about tight lacing, as if the good or harm,
the taste or barbarism of that practice were an open question. “TIGHT
LAciNG,” indeed, is given as the signature of a writer who affects to
advocate it. Our readers will perhaps be of opinion that he ought to
be invited to contribute to Punch. It is necessary to observe that
among the defenders of tight lacing in the above-named magazine there
are some who * represent themselves as men. This one writes
in the character of a lady, and is evidently a humorist. She says:–
“Most of your correspondents advocate the early use of the corset as the best
means to secure a slender waist. No doubt this is the best and most easy mode,
but still I think there are many young ladies who have never worn tight stays who
might have small waists even now if they would only give themselves the trouble.”
-
Only 1 Mark the satire that is compressed into that little word of
two syllables. “TIGHT LACING,” or, for brevity, let us say T. L.,
proceeds:–
“I did not commence to lace tightly until I was married, nor should I have done
so then had not my husband been so particularly fond of a sumall waist, but I was
determined not to lose one atom of his affection for the sake of a little trouble. I
could not bear to think of him liking any one else's figure better than mine, conse-
quently, although my waist measured twenty-three inches, I went and ordered a
air of stays, made very strong and filled with stiff bone, measuring only fourteen
łºń. round the waist.”
The foregoing, passage will be seen to be a capital imitation of the
habitual phraseology of uneducated women of the lower middle class.
“Consequently . . . I went and ordered a pair of stays” is, an ad-
mirable example of vulgar colloquialism. T. L. continues, with refer-
ence to the stays:-
“These, with the assistance of my maid, I put on, and managed the first day to
lace my waist in eighteen inches. At night I slept in the corset without loosing
the lace in the least. The next day my maid got my waist to seventeen inches, and
so on an inch smaller every day until she got them to meet."
In the specimen, above quoted, of familiar narrative, there is a
combination of touches that remind us of both Swift and Defoe, and
very much, also, that resembles the autobiography of BARON MUN-
cHAusEN: We seem to fancy we have read something like it in that
wonderful relation, as well as in Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver's Travels.
One declaration in particular savours strongly of the last named work
of creative genius:– “All night I slept in my corset without loosing
the lace in the least.” . There is an obvious mistake in it, but it is
characteristic, and the Dean of St. Patrick's all over. . So is the con:
; bit of inferior female grammar. So, pre-eminently, is what
oliows :-
“I wore them regularly without ever taking them off, having them tightened
afresh egery day, as the lace might stretch a little.”
ct stated, and the reason assigned for it, are both very like
especially the fact, which was not nice, and of all of his
may be said least to suggest the Tale of a Tub. But now to
ude T.L.'s tale :-
“They did not open in front, so that I could not undo them if I had wanted,
or the fir the pain was very great, but as soon as the stays were laced close,
and I had them so for a few days, I began to care nothing about it, and in
month o ould not have taken them of on any account, for I quite enjoyed
the sen nd when I let my husband see me with a dress to fit i was amply
repaid f uble; and although I am now grown older, and the fresh bloºm of
youth is from my cheek, still my figure remains the same, which is a char”
age will no me of. I have never had cause to regret the step I took.”
The grave representation of a figure like an egg-glass, as a charm
which age would not rob the possessor of, is highly ludicrous. Im-
mensely so, likewise, is the serious assertion on the part of a woman
that her waist was reduced from twenty-three to fourteen inches by
mere compression without ever giving any cause for regret to the
subject of that process. It is a parallel to the allegation in Swift.”
mock advertisement about the juggler, who allowed any gentleman to
drive forty twelve-penny nails up to the head in a porter's back, and
drew them out again by putting him in a loadstone chair, the said
porter feeling no pain. - -
It is gratifying to find The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine,”
structing its readers by satire. They must be very intelligent. . Let
us hope that none of them are so much the reverse as to take the iroºy
of a wise and clever man for the credible communication of a "a",
silly, and disgusting woman.

A FEW FRIENDS.
(FROM MY PHOTOGRAPH BOOK.)
TABLEAU xiv.–MY FUNNY FRIEND.—THE CAPTAIN.—THE STEWARD.-
SAILORS.
A RIDDLE suggests itself while we are at sea :-
*When is my Funny Friend not my Funny Friend? Answer. When
he’s on board the packet between Dover and Calais, and the passage is
what the Captain has already prophesied it would be-'dusty.”
Limp, huddled up on a bench, prostrated helplessly under a tar-
paulin, lay GRIGG. - -
ifeless, wn beautiful he lay, or staggering to the side of the vessel
without his sea º on, he leans o'er the bulwarks, and communes
mysteriously with the glad waters of the dark blue sea.
But now a GRIgg, now thus. I say this to him, and feel very unwell
immediately afterwards. I feel unwell, but am not in the least ill; so
that my Funny Friend has the best of me after all, though, for the time,
he has all the practical joking taken out of him.
He asks me from under a rug and a tarpaulin to fetch the Steward:
I can’t. Not from a want of will, but from a modest mistrust of my
own powers of locomotion, and a dread of the consequence; if I, once
move. I utter the word “Steward!” feebly, and flatter myself that I've
been as kind and charitable as the good Samaritan himself wºuld have
been under similar circumstances; unless, indeed, that excellent per;
son should have happened to have been a first-rate sailor, which would
of course alter the case entirely. The Steward only comes once near
us. I am glad he doesn't ap again, as the i. of him, sur-
rounded as he is by such uncomfortable traditions, makes me qualmish
and irritable. -- - -
The sailors, too, are so careless, and exhibit such shocking taste. If
I was the best sailor in the world, Ireally think that I couldn't stand
this.
The Captain comes up to me. He reminds me that he said “it
would be dusty.” He is cheerful and talkative, and apparently always
on the look-out for something in the dark. I murmur, “Yes, he was
right,” and intend to show no disposition for entering into further
conversation. He tells me, without my asking for the information,
that he’s known such nights on board on this yery passage, short as it
is (thank Heavens !), sailors, bred and born sailors, who couldn't keep
their legs, and had to be lashed to the something or other—a nautical
term meaning what I don't know...I reply, “Ab l’. I don't know
that it interests me, I don't know that I am glad to hear it, I don't
know that I am sorry to hear it, I don't know anything: I wish he
wouldn’t talk, that’s all... I prefer being left alone with my misèry,
I don’t say so, because it's unsociable, specially to a Captain; but
I am unsociable, and I mean to be. I begin to regret leaving England,
Perhaps I may never see it again. I am beginning to be envious of
GRIgG, who is in a decidedly bad state, while I am still in an unde-
cidedly bad state: which is worse...The Captain asks me why I don't
go down into the cabin P , The cabin.' ' ith all the people— I
only say, “No,” shortly, but I do wish he wouldn't come bothering
here. The cabin. Oh, confound him! I try for a moment to, com-
fort myself with the notion that GRIgg, my Funny Friend—ha! haſ–
I can’t laugh in this state, but it's the idea) is more wretched than
am. Only I can't imagine any one more wretched than I am.
Miserable Thoughts on board–Wonder who invented these con-
founded steamships? (By the way, the one thing I was careful to
explain to the Captain at first was, that “I was always all right on a
sailing-vessel,” so that he might not be taken by surprise on seeing me
all wrong on his steam one.) Why the deuce don't they make a tunnel
from Dover to Calais ? Or a bridge P I’d take a season-ticket, and walk
over. There’s the Thames Tunnel. What's that doing?...Why can't that
be utilised? " " " Raining, I think. Dusty passage, indeed. I wish
it was dusty. Oh, how I prefer travelling by coach to this infernal
if ! * * * That was a wave that time. If another comes like that, I
shall be knocked off my seat. Shall I be able to get back again f 'A
man might be blown overboard, and no one be any the wiser until they
got to Calais, and then they'd only find he was lost when they asked
for his ticket. No, that’s not right: I can’t put it right now. " * *

sailors are incredulous. The Steward comes, and wants a fee. GRIgG
treats him very curtly. He tells him he hasn't attended to him during
the passage, and in a general way charges all his sufferings on this offi-
cial. The Steward comes to me. I hate him. In the words of the
song (some song about “My Mother”), He is “the cause of this
anguish,” i.e., Thou art the cause of this anguish, my Steward!

tographs; but they are in my memory's photograph-book.
A SONG OF THE SHAMBOCK.
THE particular tint of Old Ireland is green;
By the Emerald Isle that’s the thing Poets mean.
And the wide world all over, as everyone knows,
By the name of Green Erin Hibernia goes.
There’s a Paddy that's one of the best of his kind;
PADDY GREEN is the boy that occurs to your mind.
Though the closest observer could never yet spy
Any green in his aspect or green in his eye.
Paddy Greens and Green Paddies don’t fancy the same-
Some by nature are green, others only in name;
But among simple Paddies that green we may call,
Sure the Fenians by far are the greenest of all.
'Tis with verdure they’re clad from the top to the toe,
Like the banks of Killarney where evergreens grow;
So they plot and conspire in their poor verdant way,
And they still find that traitors will traitors betray.
Oh, how green were O' Guy Fawkes and all of his band
Who the Gunpowder Treason in Clerkenwell planned,
The accomplice that was an approver behold!
It was so with conspirators ever of old.
So “The Green,” then, “above the Red 1" shout Fenian boys,
'Tis a mighty fine banner, and mighty great noise;
But the green of Green Erin is not such a hue
That she’ll e'er be done brown by such blackguards as you!
THE PECULIAR PEOPLE.
AFTER all, there is Tolerance in England...There is a Book, by the
precepts of which, the people called Christians profess to be guided.
Certain folks, calling themselves by a name derived from that Book,
have been practising a method of cure which is therein expressly
ordained in the plainest language, as a remedy. They have not been
successful. They have been sent, for trial, placed in the dock, but
acquitted. It is satisfactory to add that in a Christian country persons
have not been hanged for obedience to the New Testament. There—
so a Voltairean might sum up, and leave that affair of the “Peculiar
People.”. But he is a sham philosopher who can get nothing out of a
curious incident but the cue for a sneer. Suppose we go a little
further, and, ask what the §§. Police, who are paid to direct
wandering theologians, have been about in the district of the Peculiar
People. These poor folks had to be told by mere lawyers that though
I say I’ll give it him F.; and beg him not to bother. He puts
it forcibly to me that he won't be able to see me º as durin
the landing he’s wanted to do something (something nautical that
they had read the Book right, they had read but a bit of it. It seems
hard that simple people should have to be tried for their lives in order
|to get a little teaching.

BRIGANDS IN LONDON.
THE drama of The Streets of
London, which for some weeks past
has been performed at the Princess’s,
might be made somewhat more life-
like if a scene were introduced to
show how brutal robberies are done
in open daylight now in many
London streets. Either a lady
might be knocked down and vio-
lently trampled on, while her pocket
was ripped open, and her purse and
watch and chain and jewels were
purloined ; or a gentleman might
be tripped up, or surrounded and
garotted, and left senseless on the
pavement, robbed of all he had
about him... The business of the
scene should be well-rehearsed be-
forehand, and a score of real foot-
pads taken, say, from Endell Street,
might be specially engaged, so that
the robbing and maltreating might
be done with all pºlational correct-
ness and despatch.
THE CAUSE IN BOTH CASEs
This would clearly make a good
sensation scene, to the benefit no
doubt of MR. WINING's treasury.
Some profit to the public too would
probably accrue, for public notice
would be drawn to the unsafe state
of the streets. Perhaps SIR RICHARD
MAYNE might be tempted by the
scene, and might take a stall to see
how brutal robberies are done be
neath the eyes of the police. And
perhaps when he had thus acquired
a knowledge of this fact, he might
take measures to prevent the Streets
of London and the Brigand being
played in open daylight within
three miles of Saint Paul's.

Paying our Way in Abyssinia.
THE Abyssinian Expedition forms a case wherein the usual relation
between invaders and invaded, the latter being the weaker, are reversed.
The Abyssinians will sell us nothing for any sum under a dollar. They
thus stick it into us instead of our sticking it into them, and it is we
and not they who are plundered. These things are managed contrarily
in countries invaded by France.

THE CIR-
COMMON SENSE ON WEHEELS.
THEY still “manage some things better in France,” and among them
may be mentioned road-making and cookery. In these respects we
might with profit take a lesson from our neighbours, and perhaps the
time may come when French rollers here will be as common as French
rolls, and a vol au cent be served as well as a Welsh rarebit. What
fools the French must think us, when they see us strewing lumps of
granite loosely in our roadways, and wearing out our carriage-wheels
in grinding it to slush. . A road so formed is never firm, but quickly
becomes rotten; and the saving of steam-rollers is a short-sighted
economy, for narrow carriage-wheels make ruts and cannot bind the
stones together. Thus they are kicked aside and wasted, and, as the
road is not rolled evenly, holes are very quickly made in it, and carriage-
º are broken, and horses are tripped up, and are broken-kneed or
anned.
We Britons continually boast that we are a “practical people,” and
this is ever our excuse when charged with being inartistic. Qur build-
ings may be clumsy, our statues hideous burlesques, but we don't profess,
you know, to be an ornamental nation; our talent is for business, and
all sorts of useful works. Yet few things are more useful than good
thoroughſares and roads, and with these we either are too stingy or
too stupid to provide ourselves. If every business man would calcu.
late the time he loses daily, to say nothing of the temper, by reason of
the roughness and the badness of our roadways, there would surely
before long be held a public meeting somewhere, and somebody would
propose that somebody should do something which somehow should
help somewhat towards the mending of our ways.
NEW WERSION.
It was the reflection of a thoughtful hall-porter that the self-
denying man must be the man who says he is not at home when he is.
SUPERNATURAL IMPUDENCE.
These are awful times, Mr. Punch. Strange spirits are abroad.
J. W. K. writes to the Times an account of a street robbery, with brutal
violence, of which he was the victim. Having stunned him, the ruffians
who had knocked him down made of with his watch. The says:-
“I afterwards saw two policemen, who treated the matter very calmly, saying,
f “I was not the first who had been robbed on the same road this week.’”
Not the first! Why this is the very language of the mocking fiend.
“She is not the first.” Your readers are also . of them, readers
of Goethe, and know who said that. Two Britis policemen were
never capable of such a sneer. It was the chaff of Mephistopheles, and
his companion—Asmodeus, perhaps; possibly Modo and Mahu, himself
—who knows? Strange spirits, I say, Mr. Punch, are abroad, to say
nothing of those spirits which seem to be so intimate with spiritual
“circles” that they may be called familiar. None of them have told
us, however, where to find the Rev. MR. SPEKE.
But I say, Sir, what a pass we have come to when robbery is so
rampant, for want of policemen, that we have Mephistopheles and
another roaming the streets in the disguise of two of those deficient
Guardian Angels, and saying to a man who has been plundered and
maltreated, “You are not the first.” For never could that jocular but
unfeeling observation have proceeded from the mouth of a beneficent
creature whose popular name is the fond and playful diminutive of
RoBERT.

A TRADE REFORM BILL WANTED.
DEAR LORD DERBY, - -
Now that Parliament is assembling, you will have little time
to spare for reading any thing but Blue Books; and foreseeing this,
you doubtless took good care to read, during the holidays, whatever
was worth reading in reviews and magazines. Of course you read the
famous article in the October Quarterly—not that upon the Talmud,
though perhaps it was the famous one, but the one upon Trades'
Unions, wherein these words occur:—
“This then is our case against the Trades' Unions. . . . We say that they injure
working class whom they are
meant to aid, that they threaten some branches of manufactures with extinction,
and seriously limit the diffusion of others, that they are carried on by means fatal
to every right that a free country respects, that they are ruinous to the legitimate
ambition of industry and merit, that they can only be conducted by a systematic
breach of the law, and that they run through the whole gamut of crime, from a
mere conspiracy in restraint of trade, to robbery, arson, mutilation, and murder."
|
That every word of this is thoroughly well founded there is in the
article put forth abundant proof.
That Trades' Unions are becoming a curse to the whole country,
and, if not utterly extinguished, should be sweepingly reformed, surely
no one in his senses will venture to deny. How we may reform them
the Quarterly points out:—
“A Friendly or Provident Society, which cannot obtain registration for its rules,
should be absolutely prohibited, and the attempt to establish or carry on such a
society should be treated as a fraud, and punished as a criminal act. By this simple
means an effectual bar would be interposed to that conjunction, out of which the
power of Trades' Unions mainly arises—the union of a fraudulent Provident Society
with a society formed for the purpose of restraining trade."
|
|. My Lord, as you are now at the head of the Reformers, and were
fortunate last Session in passing a Reform Bill, let me
year to try and pass another. Amend the law by which conspiracy
and fraudulence, beneath the mask of providence, are suffered to com-
|bine: forbid the banns of marriage—the crime bearing Trades' Union
—of conspirators and cheats; and thus annihilate the trade of “loath-
some miscreants” like BROADHEAD, and gain the thanks of honest,
free-born Englishmen, like

Publicans, have been at him to know his opinion about MR. ABEL
SMITH's Bill for restraining Sunday tipple. He has poked some fun
at them. He tells them that their present organisation for what they
consider protection is admirable; but that a Reform Act has passed,
and the representation will be Doubled, Trebled, and in some places
$º: (lights on the Leap in the Dark), the political influence of
the Publicans will diminish in that proportion, and will in many places
be ºº:: therefore, they cannot expect in future “to force
men in the House of Commons to vote against their Convictions” for
the sake of the public-house. He therefore suggests that they make
kind of regulation that is suggested for the prevention of drunken-
ness. Mr. Punch's sentiments on Liquor are too well known to make
it needful for him to say, that any effort in the Puritan direction will
meet with his bitterest enmity. But regulation is one thing, and su
pression is another.

MY DEAR DISRAELI, - •

that is practical, don't you clap a penny tax on
PHOTOGRAPHS P - -
I have mentioned it before, but as our friend BRIGHT said last week,
it is necessary in England to repeat a thing a great many times before
it obtains attention.
There are about five millions of photographs made every year.
Do you know how much five millions of pennies, make? 9f course
ou don’t, nor do I, nor does either of us know how to calculate it.

Some way of finding out, with decimals, or cubes, or hyperbolic logger-

POACHERS, BEWARE I
GAME butchers are more plentiful in England than in France, for
most of the French landholders have fortunes far too small to allow of
big battues. There cannot be much game preserved where everybody
shoots; and as their guns well-nigh outnumber their partridges and
pheasants, it is not very surprising that French sportsmen condescend
to shoot at smaller game. By universal pot-hunting such havoc has
been made, that fears are entertained lest there be nothing left to
shoot; and recently an outcry has been raised against the poachers,
and it is said more stringent game laws are shortly to be passed. More
than half-a-million chasseurs yearly pay for a certificate, and doubtless
count themselves quite numerous enough to kill the scanty game there
is now left for them to shoot. So we cannot wonder they feel savage
with the poachers. Still, they must be well-nigh savages to dream of
doing things like this:–
“One proposition is, that all the rural guards should be well armed with re-
volvers, and provided with mastiffs of English breed, with acute noses for ferreting
out poachers; these dogs to be previously trained to the attack by exercising them
upon puppets dressed up in dark-coloured clothes, such as night poachers commonly
wear, and in which they might find une sanglante nowrriture.”
Our French friends may not know that mastiffs are not used in

£43s. 4d., and that is a thousand pence. Well, a million is ten hun-
dred thousand. O, bother, we shall never do it so. There must be
some shorter way. Let us divide five millions by a penny, that seems
simple. One in five—stop, that only brings us where we were before
like the American pig that thought it was getting out of the field
through the pipe, §§ the pipe was crooked, and brought him in
again. -
Well, details are beneath great minds. I suppose you will allow
that five million pence make a very large sum of money, which would
look well among your pretty figures? -
Get it, then, by enacting that no photograph shall be sold unless it
bears an impressed stamp of one penny. - - -
A photograph is surely a Luxury. At least, people think it so,

Also, the Tax is so small that no one who can afford a photograph
can feel the addition. -
Also, the work of collection will be very easy. Let the Post Offices
sell the stamped cards. -
It is possible that a few of the touting blackguards who infest the
streets, haul in customers and fight for them, may be discouraged by
the tax; but this, instead of being an evil, will be a very good thing.
Humble and honest artists will buy their photograph stamps day by
day as they do their letter stamps. - -

THE MAINE LAW A MULL.
In a lecture delivered the other evening at Exeter Hall on America,
the Rev. NewMAN HALL, according to the Pall Mall Gazette, made
the following important statement:—
“Touching the position of the temperance cause in the States, he said that the
Maine Law had, he was sorry to state, proved inoperative, and would, he believed,
shortly be repealed, and a strict excise law, such as was in force in New York,
substituted for it.”
The United Kingdom Alliance, and the promoters of Liquor Bills in
the Legislature may be congratulated on the fact above announced.
It will save them trouble, if they will only be so reasonable as to learn
the lesson which it ought to teach them; namely, that moderation in
the use of exhilarating drinks is not to be effected by Maine force, and
that the only means of getting people to practise it is moral suasion.
THE RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT LAST DISCOWERED.
THE Pall Mall Gazette says, “...MR. TRAIN is now “lecturing’ on the
“True Laws of Health’ at a Water-cure establishment, St. Anne's

FASHIONABLE HALF DRESS,
pº subjoined piece of an advertising paragraph is cut out of the

“NudA VERITAs.-This valuable specific changes grey hair to its original shade,
after which the hair grows out the natural colour, and not grey. As a dressing, it
is superior to pomades.”
Indeed! . Muda Meritas, no doubt. The bare truth, neither less;
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth—not the bare-
faced reverse of the truth, by any means. Certainly not.
. But what are we to make of Muda Peritas “as a dressing” The
time may come when fashionable young ladies will go in the character
of Truth to a Fancy Ball—not, oś, a Fancy Dress Ball. They
only half do it now—in a costume corresponding to that of a pugilist
prepared for the ring. So perhaps are they—but can they expect to

Short clothes and long clothes—that seems to be the definition of
Evening Fashions for February. ‘Imagination suggests that its wearers
are mermaids:–

You seem to suspect that, if the whole Truth were visible, you would
see a reproduction of that direful monster who :—
“seemed woman to the waist, and fair,
But ended, foul, in many a scaly fold,
Voluminous and vast, a serpent armed
With mortal sting.”
So that if masquerading WERITAs were entirely nuda, Truth would
turn out to be no prettier than Sin. Full dress used to be the fashion
of evenings; now it is half dress; but how should it be otherwise
when it is copied from the demi-monde?

'Twas the drum you heard, 'twas the fife's piercing note,
As our corps, that a Fenian had slurred,
Did that soldier discharge who had been its blot,
And the doom of a felon incurred.
We made him a shabby and shameful sight,
Inside out his coat by turning, ..
In the open glare of the broad daylight,
Where no other light was burning.
No badge or medal adorned his breast,
Off his buttons we tore, confound him!
And his good conduct stripe we removed with the rest,
Having formed a square around him.

For the scoundrel we felt no sorrow,
And we º in a º that covered his head,

To gaol; as a martyr parade him:
But little he’ll know of all their golngs On,
In the cell where his treason has laid him.
Thus much of our morning's work was done
In the face of his comrades i.
For the sake of example that all should shun ;
And with Fenians avoid conspiring.
To the gate of the barracks we led him down,
As he went, to conclude a long story,
The Rogue's March being played to proclaim his renown,
Then in handcuffs he went to his glory.

A RUFFLED PROPHET.
DR. CUMMING is getting irritable, for which we are sorry, inasmuch
as he is tolerable only because of the fun he causes. He must really
not be angry because the universe does not explode at the exact time
he fixes for that event... He is not everybody, and if his sapient con-
gregation is content with him, and the public is as good-natured to
him as to ZADKIEL, RAPHAEL, and the other Vaticinators, it is as
much as the Seraphic Doctor ought to expect.
He writes petulantly to say that he never prophesied anything.
Now this is only squabbling over words, for he distinctly says that
“about 1868” is pointed to by those who have studied the subject as
a date at which the end may be expected. Theologians are proverbially ,
slippery, but if that is not prophesying, what is
We are never angry—except when Fº richly deserve it—but if
we were habitually furious, we should be soothed into smiles by the
Seraphic Doctor's desperate attempt to wrap up his “three frogs” in

Especially to us, his fellow augurs, because he will remember that the
Greek poet LIvy expresses his wonder that augurs, can ever meet

VALENTINE’s DAY.
MR. Punch has received
his first instalment of Valentines
from the young ladies at MR.
RIMMEL’s. The Valentines are
as pretty as their donors, and so
odorous, that Mr. Punch ex-
claimed, "Ah! Yes!

INARTICULATE INFORMATION.
It is highly requisite that the Directors of the Underground Railway
should cause those servants of theirs whose duty it is tº call out the
names of the stations to be taught to speak intelligibly. The eye often
misses the station's name as the train passes it...You hear a fellow
shouting “Oosh! Qoosh!” for example, or “N'ill N'il!’ What
can you make out of Nil, but nothing; and what mor; can yºu under-
stand from 'Oosh? He means “Shepherd's Bush,” and “Notting
Hill.” It would be good of MR. MACREADY to come out of his retire-
ment and give those inarticulate railway men lessons on elocution.
Whilst on this subject we may also observe that the conductors of
certain omnibuses are in the habit of uttering a cry which may some-
times occasion gross misapprehension. ...As they go, or halt, on their
journey westward, they keep continually calling out “EMMA SMITH!
EMMA SMITH !” Who is £º SMITH a country gentleman might
ask. They are supposed to mean Hammersmith.

DELIGHTFUL PROSPECT.
Hunting Man (to town friend, arrived on a visit). “Look, OLD FELLow !
That's The MARE I'M GoING To Put You on To-MORRow.
She's QUITE FREsh, You see ; HAD Two of MY MEN off YESTERDAY, At ExERcise !”
A FEW FRIENDS.
(FROM MY PHOTOGRAPH BOOK.)
TABLEAU XV.-MY FUNNY FRIEND IN PARIS.
The last photograph of My Funny Friend GRIgG in Paris, Done at
Paris in a French hat, a French winter-coat trimmed with fur, with a
large fur cape, usually and only worn by coachmen, and a white “hide-
nose” (as he will insist upon calling his wrapper—the cache-nez of our
lively neighbours) round his throat. GRIgG abroad is perhaps rather a
greater nuisance than GRIgG at home. The climate, he says, raises his
animal spirits, and makes him joyous and lively as a little bird on a fine
spring morning. - -
I am pleased to see GRIgG adopting, as it were, the national costume
for the time of year. It argues, I say to myself, that he is going to
try and assimilate himself to the people about him, and behave like
an ordinary Parisian, for whom, in his present dress, he could easily
be mistaken; that is, if he wouldn't talk.
My great desire when at Rome is to do as the Romans do, and be
taken for a Roman by my travelling fellow-countrymen; this, I con-
fess, is flattering. As it would be one of my pleasures in Turkey to be
regarded as one of the Turkeys, so in Paris I derive a real pleasure
from being mistaken for a Parisian. If l don't speak, the deception is
perfect, and I defy any one at a table-d'hôte to detect my nationality.
The waiters, who are Prussians or Russians, can't tell, and I never
lift the mask. -
GRIGG lifts the mask; he's always doing it, and annoying me. I
try to shirk him, but it's no good. Where I go, he goes; where, I
dine he will dine too, and no amount of hat, sealskin wrapper, hide-
nose, or great-coat, can make my Funny Friend anything but a regular
downright Englishman, and so half the charm of Paris is to me gone.
GRIGG thinks it necessary to protest against the very French garments
he has on : he finds fault with everything; while, I own, being here
for pleasure, I am inclined to praise anything. In the streets and
all public places he is of opinion that he is “having a lark with the
foreign coves,” as he expresses it, by assuming the tone and bearing of
the traditional John Bull.
We walk up the Boulevard des Italiens. I like looking in at the
º windows, dawdling my day away. -
RIGG lets me alone, and walks on for a short distance. There is a
young and very pretty French lady inspecting the same window as
myself. I feel that I am one of a gallant nation, and settle my shirt-
collar, which is a trifle too stiff this morning. I know I can't talk to
her, even if I had the F. of her acquaintance. But she isn't
aware of this fact, and, from her manner, I suspect she thinks me a
gay young Count--a Monsieu R JUAN; and her mamma or aunt, who
has just caught sight of me through her spectacles, will immediately
take her away. . This flatters me; I don't mind confessing it; and
feel the French language flowing into my veins. The pretty girl acciden-
tally drops her tortoise-shell purse. Accidental? Glowing with a new
sensation, and with the French language and spirit rushing into me
(so to speak, like the water in a house when it’s “turned on "), I step
forward, pick up the purse, and am about to present it to the lady with
the Fº bow I can make by raising my hat several inches above my
head, when that infernal GRIGG comes up suddenly and loudly, with
“Hallo, MR. RoAstBEEF l’” he always will call me Roast BEEF, or
SMITH, or BRow N, or some such, name, in Paris; it does make me, so
angry. I {{ to ignore him, and in presenting the purse, am prepain
a few French words, commencing with “Permeties,” but what I’m
going to say after that I don’t know; when my Funny Friend, regard;
less of everything and everyone except himself and his confounded
“fun,” continues in a sort of robust, farmer-like voice, “I say, come
and see my bull-dog kill rats, and have a lot of plum-pudding !”
Plum-pudding ! Bull-dog! Favouring the most mistaken French
notions about us.
I should like to explain to the pretty young French lady and her
mamma or aunt that my name is not Mister Roastbeer, and that
I am not in the habit of seeing bulldogs kill rats and eating plum:
pudding at twelve o'clock in the middle of the day. There is no sort
of opportunity: hearing GRIgg, they acknowledge my civility curtly,
and are off.
I am annoyed: justly.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 75
“I beg,” I say to GRIGG, remonstrating firmly. “I do beg you
won't call out Mister Roast BeEF to me again.”
He says he’s very sorry—he's º ready to say this—but, he
thought I'd like to keep up our national character. I am afraid that
on this occasion I exclaimed Dash the national character. (“Dash"
is not the word.) - - -
Whenever, he is near a sentinel he invariably comes out with the
word Waterloo; such execrable taste as I pointed, out to him, and
might lead to something serious, with a bayonet perhaps.
His language in Paris, too, becomes so dreadfully strong. On
every possible occasion, even when he is merely hiring a voiture, he will
use what is supposed by the French to be our national compound oath.
“Combien º’ for instance, I ask a voiturier, politely. -
| GRIgG, standing at my elbow, immediately exclaims, pronouncing
what French words he does use with a most execrably English accent;
“Wee, Godam Rosbif, oh my eyel ... Combeang—how much, my eye ''
If I remonstrate, I know he will call me MistER PLUMPUDDING... But
for this I might pass peaceably among Parisians as one of themselves.
My Funny Friend tells me he knows Paris; certainly, Paris, will
soon know him. On pretence of taking me straight to the Panthéon
by a short cut, he walks me about for two hours, until at last I charge
him with not knowing the way. To this he invariably has one excuse,
“that Paris has been so altered since he was last here.” I suggest
that we’d better ask a sergent de ville the way. GRIgG bows politely
to a stern-looking sergent. I am glad to see that he does bow.
“Monsieur,” says GRIGG, “J'ai quelque chose a vows demander.”
The sergent listens officially.
“Pernettez-moi,” continues, GRIgg, “Une porte, Monsieur-vous
saves?” The sergent inclines his head, and gives all his mind to it. I
am interested, being under the impression that this is some French
idiom for asking your way to the Panthéon.
He continues, “Une porte, quand est-ce qu'il n'est pas une porte '"
| The sergent looks from GRIgG to me. I confess I did not catch what
he said, so unfortunately beg him to repeat it, which he immediately
does, adding pleasantly, “Le donnez-vouz en haut f* Before the
official has time to decide whether he has been insulted or not, I take
GRIGG forcibly away, and hurry him down the first turning to the
right. , 1 tell him plainly I won’t go about with him any more: where-
upon he sets up a howl, and pretends to weep bitterly. If I knew my
way home, or could see a voiture, I’d leave him; but believing that he
really does know his road back, it’s better to stop. When he is quiet

I propose the Theatre in the evening. GRIGG says, By all means;

bureau. I look from one to the other. The shopkeeper, or librarian,
or whatever he is, civilly accosts, me. “What an I in search of?”

wonder how he, knew I was an Englishman?, I make up my mind to

condescend to reply in English.
The man stares, and doesn’t understand me.

and to ask him to speak to this idiot of a Librarian. (By the way.

through the glass door, and grinning fiendishly from ear to ear.
| The Librarian, who is really a civil fellow, sees how the matter
stands, and so do I now: GRIgg at the window. The Librarian pre-
sents me with a Guide to Paris, and points out to me the description

deuced good-natured fellow, I should—
Here prudence warns me to break off. For after all, what is the
good of jºi. for not kicking a man, on the ground of your im-
perturbable good nature, when the expressed intention might lead him
to consideritas done, and then returnit? Besides, a fight between two
Englishmen in the streets of Paris would be too great a scandal; and
more than that, the French would find out that there was one English-
man who could not “box,” a discovery which I am sure would injure
our national character in their eyes.
. But my Funny. Friend sees his advantage, “Sir,” says he, quoting
in a serious tone from a celebrated farce, “can you fight?”
Itell him not to be a donkey; I say this because º know that the
proper answer in Bor and Cor is “No,” which would lead to exactly
the reply that I don't want. In a second he throws himself into a
pugilistic attitude, and proceeding with the dialogue says, “Come on!”
We are at the corner of a street; I turn down it sharply, and gain

had any idea that he was annoying me, he wouldn't have done it for
the world, Finally, he asks me to put of leaving this evening, and to

I don't know why it is, but I like GRIgg; he is, really, a very good

present, a Frenchman, a friend of his?. I say, “Oh, no; he is the

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
HEY met on Thursday, the Eve of
Sillſ § St. Valentine, and, appropriately,
SUR § the Lords heard something about
Promissory Oaths, but the CHAN-
CELLOR would not then be explicit.
LORD DERBy was unable to be
present, and Mr. Punch sincerely
regrets that podagra medicines

CLANRICARDE said something or
other about Irish land, and the
other Lords naturally went away.
New writs in the Commons.
SIR CHARLEs JASPER SELwyN,
late the Solicitor-General, is
made a Lord Justice, and sits
beside LoRD CAIRNs, so Cam-

ber. There be two Candidates,
MR.? CLEASBY, Q.C., and MR.
BEREsford Hope. The latter
gentleman vacates Stoke-upon-

is MR. BALIOL. BRETT, Q.C.,

“The great Vision of the Guarded Mount,”

about on all fours till somebody came and informed them that was not
the way to use their hands, so they put them into their pockets, and
have kept them there ever since—according to their satiric neighbours.
MR. BRETT is promised a fight for his seat, which is attacked by MR.
Rogers, a Liberal lawyer, and it is a question whether Solicitor or
Solicitor-General wins:

those which will ignite only on their own box.
Caledonia, stern and wild, was informed that her Reform Bill would
be presented on the following Monday.
| Mortification and Disappointment. Absit omen, but these be ugly
words in an opening speech by the Leader of the House. He had to
announce that he had intended to follow the advice of the Select Com-
mittee, which recommended that Election Bribery Cases should be
taken away from the jurisdiction of the House of Commons, and should
be tried by the Judges. But the Judges, on being poſitely asked to
state their views as to the best method of managing this, imitated the
chickens who were consulted by their owner on the best method of
cooking them. “But we don't want to be cooked.” MR. DISRAELI
did not feel equal to the famous rejoinder. “Confine yourselves to the
questiºn, Gentlemen,” and in the first place felt the mortification and
disappointment above mentioned, and in the second caused a new plan
to be devised. He proposed to have a new tribunal, to be composed
of three barristers, at £2,000 a year each, to try election petitions, and
be appealed to against revising barristers. He further proposed that
any M. P., unseated for bribery, should be kept out for seven years,
and on a second conviction should be incapable of ever coming in
any more.
- 5. brethren the Judges objected to the original plan “on constitu-
tional and personal grounds,” and declared that the new duties would
be incompatible with their oaths of office, their present functions, and
their duty to the Queen and country. This sounds very *...*.
The plain English may be that they think they have enough, to do
already...Inasmuch as the idea that British Judges would not try election
cases fairly because in earlier life those eminent persons are mostly
keen politicians, is simply all our eye and MR. Justice MARTIN. We
won't talk about the proverbial purity of the Ermine, because, we
believe that the article in question is not appended to judicial robes,
and also because the story of the Mustela erminea, or stoat, being such
a particularly clean beast is exploded, like every other pretty story.
But Mr. Punch has too much reverence for his brother Judges to allow
such nonsense to be talked. The real objection is a valid one, but
might be got, over by the appointment of more Judges. Mr. Panch,
however, while he detests, abhors, and abominates bribery in all its
forms, (even in, the shape of a smile from a lovely Person) cannot be
blind to the fact that the opinion of the majority of Britishers is not
yet sufficiently enlightened to enable them to perceive that the giving

the felon's dock. And unless public feeling backs the laws, they will
not be enforced. Argal, we must educate folks a little more before we
can, with advantage, proceed to dire severity in the matter.
The House of Commons showed considerable distaste for the pro-
posal that it should part with its power over its Members.
MR. KNATch BULL. Hugess EN (precious ugly name, but awfully old,
that KNATCHBULL; learned MR. MARK ANTHONY Low ER guesses
that knatch is North Country for knock, and that some KNATCHBULL of
other days was a daring tauridor) who is a Liberal, could consent to
such a transfer only to the highest tribunal. -
SIR FRANCIs GöLDSMID (Liberal) was for putting the defeated can-
didate into Parliament, if he had not bribed, and his victor had.
MR. WHITBREAD (Liberal) thought it monstrous to say that the
Judges could not do the work.
SIR Robert Collier (Liberal) had been on the Select Committee,
and was disinclined to part with the House's power to any but the
Judges, and so felt MR. RussELL GURNEY. M.R. SANDFORD was for
retaining jurisdiction. -
MR. Lowe (Liberal) was for making the Judges do what the House
required, or for showing them off the bench. They were the public
servants, and bound to do their duties like the meanest. If there were
not º, make more. But do not part with the jurisdiction to any
one else.
LoRD CRANBoRNE (Conservative) thought the Judges had been wise
and patriotic, and he dwelt on the early politics objection.
SIR. RoundELL PALMER (Liberal-Conservative) was exquisitely
polite to the Judges (at whose head he means to be one of these fine
days) and thought that their number must be increased if more work
were given them. -
MR. HENLEY (Conservative) of course was against change.
So was MR. AYRTON (Liberal), who thought that the aspersions on
election committees emanated from the impure minds of election
agents. MR. Bouverie (Liberal) too, was for retaining the power,
but improving the committees. -
SIR §. BEACH (Conservative), however, did not think much of
the wisdom of committees. l
MR. BERKELEY (Liberal) implored Government not to take away
tº:
R. GLADSTONE º thought, that no blame
attached to Government in the matter. It was easier to condemn
than to suggest. The House was strong enough in the affections of
traditions needful to
weaker assemblies. He was in favour of transfer, but asked MR.
DISRAELI to note that some twenty gentlemen, some of weight, had
protested against its being made to any inferior tribunal. He should
give candid consideration to the proposed plan.
MR. BRIGHT (Conservative) thought that the case must be desperate
when a popular house would transfer its powers in regard to seats.
But there? was no desperate case. Let us try to prevent bribery. It
was due to small constituencies and 'open voting. "Let us make large
constituencies, and give the Ballot. The proposed remedy was
unpleasant and humiliating. - - - - - -
MR. Locke (Liberal) was for maintaining the ancient rights of the
House. So was MR. CARTER, so was MR. GoLDING.
MR. DARBY GRIFFITH (Liberal-Conservative), said something civil
to. * Government, and was curious to know all that the Judges had
Salol.
MR. DISRAELI made no reply to him, or to anybody else, and leave
was given to bring in the Bil
Yes, MRs. GRUNDY, M’m, an uncommonly dull evening, devoted to
an uncommonly disagreeable subject. We can't help that. There was
not an element of fun in the whole business. On the whole, it may be
thought rather scandalous. The first night of the resumed session of
the first assembly in the world is devoted to admissions that people
et into it in a disgraceful manner, and to a discussion whether it is
onest enough to deal out justice to such folks...We see nothing to
laugh at, MRs. GRUNDy. Nor did a single Member venture on
jocularity. As CHAUCER saith,

i. perhaps in less than yeres two we shall have new lights on the
subject.
Meantime, with tears in our eyes, we must own that the first night
of the Session was not, a pleasant one for the Government, and as

Mistress. “You R CHARACTER Is SATISFACTORY, BUT I'M very PARTICULAR About on E THING : I wish MY SERVANTs to HAVE
PLENTY, BUT I Don't ALLow ANY WASTE.”
A SPEECH-GAUGE FOR ST. STEPHEN’S.
SoME journal lately stated that a sixteen-minute sand-glass, which
the writer called a “Sermon gauge,” had been royally presented to
some pulpit near the Strand. The report was contradicted, and some
heathens were believed to have felt sad for half a second at hearing that
the tale was thought to be untrue.
Punch rarely condescends to borrow an idea, but no mere charge of
#ºg shall stop him from, suggesting, now that Parliament has met,
that a Speech Gauge would be really an immense boon in St. Stephen's.
Whether Members would submit to a sixteen minute limit, may be open
to some question; but there cannot be a doubt that their reporters
would rejoice if that restriction were enforced. What prosiness, what
platitudes would they happily escape, if the longest-winded speakers
were but given sixteen minutes | Perhaps, by some mice mechanism,
sand, when ending each four minutes, might be made to sound a
ong, in order that the orator might time his periods aptly, and allow
f:lf at intervals a moment for reflection. It would be terribly pro-
voking to find one's time was up before one had blazed off all the fire-
works one had been so long preparing, and orators would doubtless
rehearse their speeches well beforehand, to ascertain exactly the precise
amount of time each point in them would take.
Anybody who knows anything about political debates is, doubtless,
thoroughly aware that few speeches are delivered in an hour and a half
which might not quite as well be made in sixteen minutes. Were a
speech-gauge to sanctioned, of the limit here suggested, it would
:.. teach speakers to think before they speak, a feat which very
many of them have probably been hitherto too lazy to attempt. In
s g, as in writing, it is easier to be prolix than pithy and concise.
As somebody says somewhere, -
“Words are like leaves, and, where they most abound,
Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found."
Were orators to study "Punch's Essence of Parliament” they
might learn a useful lesson in the art of condensation, and fit themselves

for making pregnant sixteen-minute speeches, which would stand a
better chance of being listened to attentively, and faithfully reported,
than wearisome, long winded, empty hour-and-half harangues, With
a speech-gauge in the House, what a saving there would be in the time
spent in legislation! How short would be the Sessions, and how small
the waste of paper in the publishing of Hansard, compared with what
has hitherto been squandered on debates' How rare would be the
midnight sittings of the House, and to what improvement in its ways
would this conduce . . Instead of loitering about, and smoking till the
small hours, with the dissolute excuse of expecting a division, Members
would be able to get home by ten o'clock, and would be in time to take
their wives into society, or to civilise themselves by going with them
to the Opera, or by spending a domestic quiet evening at home. At
present Parliament too often is regarded as a club, and Members, on
the plea of being “wanted at the House,” are led into all sorts. of
selfish dissipations, while their wives think them engaged in settling
national affairs. If short speeches were the rule, short sittings would
be usual; and Members would no longer have excuses for late hours.
For domestic reasons, therefore, a speech:gauge would be really quite
a godsend to the House, and, if certain “persons” were allowed to
give º votes, the ways and means of getting one would speedily be
granted. -
Midnight legislation is seldom beneficial, and if, by setting up a
sixteen-minute speech-gauge, the Commons should be led to give
up their late hours, it would clearly be a proof that they possess some
Commons’ sense.

AN ENIGMA.
A PopULAR essayist speaks of a boy on a steamer offering “to brush
human boots.” Hoby, to create a new oath, what are “human”
boots?, An awful thought banishes sleep. Have we not read that in
the dark ages, or the middle ages, or the seven ages, or at all events
ages ago, somebody, who had been proved guilty of Erastianism, or Pela-
gianism, or a wavering faith in astrology and the virtues of the blood-
stone, or some such deadly heresy, had his cuticle tanned and converted
into leather, which may still be seen by travellers ornamenting the door
of the refectory of a monastery in Morocco, or was it Russia? Has this
tremendous punishment been revived amongst us (lookout, CoLENso!)
and are these “human” boots the Fº result f What will polishe
society say to such hideous cruelty?. Or are they called “human” to
distinguish them from inhuman, which we take to be boots that are
new, that pinch, that are tight, that heat the foot, that press upon
corns and callosities, on hot days and dust roads, on hot nights and
chalked floors? Or are they designated “human” to contrast them
with brute; but then the beasts we are best acquainted with, the
çiyilised animals at the Zoological Gardens, not even do they appear in
Wellingtons, or elastic sides, or patent leathers?
Our questionings seem bootless. There appears to be but one other
solution of the riddle. The “human boots” on board the steamer
must have been the useful menial largely employed at hotels; but why
he was there, unless it was his vacation, or why the boy offered to
brush him in particular, or why the popular essayist saw anything so
remarkable in the occurrence as to chronicle it for us and after time,
long reflection and much smoke have failed to discover.

PHYSICIANS OF THE FAIR SEX.
MR. PUNCH,
WHEN your likeness has passed through a photograph and a
woodcut, why do you resemble a patient with tie-douloureur? Because
you suffer in the face. And if you suffer, Sir—excuse me—what must
a lady?
* question should be considered with reference to a portrait
w adorns the Lady's Own Paper. It is meant for Miss ELIZABETH
GARRETT, Physician, and L.S.A.. I am told that it is like enough to
be recognisable, but very inadequate. MR. BRALLAGHAN informs me
that it might be taken for the picture of a considerably elder twin-sister.
The “counterfeit presentment” of the above-named lady, is accom-
panied by a sketch of her career, the like of which might be recom-
mended to the pursuit of young ladies disposed thereto, and capable
thereof. Might be, that is, if the Apothecaries, unable, legally, to
reject, Miss GARRETT, had not since, by a by-law, excluded female
candidates for their diploma, and if such candidates were not also
excluded by the other medical corporations.
Why, Sir, are they excluded? According to DR. PRIG and DR,
PUMPwATER, because the constitution of the female mind is not adapted
to the cultivation of médical science. PUMPwATER and PRIG . aS
well say that women have no right to be pianists because the constitu;
tion of the female mind is not adapted to the cultivation of musical
science. Many women are quite as capable of routine practice as the
average of medical men, in so far as intelligence goes, only they
want nerve for it. The number of women fit to be medical women may
not be great... But what shall we say of the man who argues that
therefore the injustice of excluding them from the medical profession
is small? ...Palliating an injustice on the ground that it is “only a
little one,” betokens a no small Philistine; but confounding, more-
over, an injustice done to a small number with a small injustice bespeaks
a very Goliath of Philistines.
: Tell the medical corporations, Mr. Punch, that they are afraid of
female competition, that they are no better than Trades' Unions, that
their Presidents are all so many Potters; bid them shake hands with
BiºADHEAD, and fraternise with CRookes.
... There are many ladies who have their living to get, and wish to get
it themselves by themselves. Almost the o employment open to
them is that of a Governess. If I were a girl Y,...; much prefer a
situation at a respectable confectioner's.
It is not every girl who, though she might marry if she chose, wishes
to marry. Some girls object to matrimonial servitude. They feel no
beer, and perform the other function which
..º. chronicle sm
Inline ent names. They have sense enough to see what wedlock is
in nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-
nine cases out of a million, and they don't much value the chance of the
paradise on Earth which it offers them. A few would accept husbands
if they could find men that they could like better than other men;
these are among the salt of the earth, only the earth, I fear, Sir, is but
slightly seasoned by them. Those of them who have as much brain as
heart would make first-rate doctors. -
Well, Sir, and then there are girls who can't get married because
they are “plain,” and men for whom they would be valuable wives are
so dull as not to see that a plain face will never spoil, whereas a hand-
some one will, generally very soon, whilst, long before that, familiarity
will have bred š. for it, not to say contempt. -
Besides, Mr. Punch, a medical lady might marry as well as practise.
She might go into double partnership with a medical gentleman. Her
specialty, of course, º be the night-bell business, and when sum-
: on that, she could leave the sleeping partner, for the time being,
enlild.
1 am interested, Sir, in the future of some young ladies. . Their
faces are their fortunes, and very fair fortunes too, but their abilities
would be more lucrative if they could exert them in the medical line.
I have seen them at work on fashion-book patterns as intricate as the
distribution of the fifth pair of nerves. If they were only to give to
the study of anatomy the attention which they devote to that of fiddle-
ſaddle, they would soon qualify themselves for the Fellowship of the
College of Surgeons. But they can't try for it. I say, this is a
shame, and I say, moreover, that it is not for men's interest that girls
should be under the necessity of marrying, when they would, if they
could, take refuge from matrimony in medicine. - -
You are no Fenian, Sir, but blow up the Council which presides over
medical education. Make them throw open the healing profession tº
ladies who have qualified themselves for its practice. That they had
better make a graceful concession whilst they can, than be forced to do
justice º a Reformed Parliament, is a suggestion respectfully offered
to them by a Brother CHIP.
P.S. The medical corporations will perhaps make a merit of being no
respecters of Persons. An indifferent joke, Sir, to cover a wrong.

ANOTHER "Rock AHEAD"
MR. PdxcH is chivalry itself. Whenever a new Knight comes into
the ring, SIR MAGNUs PUNCH courteously hails him, introduces him to
the spectators, reads out the heraldry on his shield, and wishes him
good fortune and the smiles of dames. Having thus done his duty to
the stranger, there is nothing to prevent SIR MAGNUs Punch from
laying lance in rest, and coming down, as LoRDLYTToN says, like an
Armed Storm on horse and horseman, and knocking them into the
middle of next week. It all depends upon the like or dislike he may
take to the proceedings of the new party. In this spirit he apprises
his readers that there is a young weekly paper called The Rock, which is
of the class called religious. He has seen but one number—the fourth.
There is no lack of vigour in it. The new journal's mission is to assail
the Church of Rome—the Mock Turtle Ritualists—and the enemies of
the Church of Ireland, and, as we infer, the Broad Church and the inde-
pendent thinkers. DEAN CLose, who signifies his admiration of the
paper, encourages it not to be afraid of speaking out. So it attacks
the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY for presuming to call the Greek
clergy “his brethren in the Lord.”. The paper has a picture of itself,
but this is not a rock, but a mountain cone, on the top of which only a
very few people can stand; a hint, we suppose, that the Evangelical
conductors believe that a very few people #. rightly, or are in a safe
condition. The pitch into Catholic priests generally is done with
energy; and when we have added that the Rock recommends Foxe's
Book ºf Martyrs to everybody, we shall have performed our office of
courtesy. Greeting the Rock politely, we retire with the idea that we may
have to smash some Roc's eggs.
Legally Impossible.
." At the last sitting of the March Magistrates”—such is the be-
inning of a º raph detailing something which occurred before this
nch one º ast month. Can any one explain how it is possible
for the March Magistrates to sit in January *
-
A PEABODY TO THE POLICE.
It is with peculiar satisfaction that Mr. Punch transcribes, from a
police report of the proceedings at Marlborough Street, on Saturday,
the 8th instant, the following announcement :-
“Inspectors Thompson and GARForth came to the Court to apprise MR. Knox
that a gentleman had given a donation of £1000, the interest of which was to be
applied to the purpose of giving recompenses and gratuities to future constables
injured or maltreated in the exercise of their duties. Sin Thomas Heway, Mº.
Waughan, MR. Knox, and another Magistrate were named trustees; and the gentle-
man, who did not desire his name to be made public, wished the circumstance to be
known, as it might have the effect of inducing others to come forward and subscribe
to this fund.” -
Whenever Mr. Punch obliges the universe with a solo on the trum-
pet, he always borrows an instrument for that purpose. He never, on
any occasion, makes use of his own, except in the seclusion of perfect
solitude, when he occasionally gives breath to the music of an approv-
ing conscience. He cannot, however, refrain from pointing out the
speedy sequence of the donation above recorded upon the remarks
lately appeared in a certain periodical on the high deserts of policemen
who incur bodily harm in their country's service. He will not say that
there are any who owe him a thousand pounds, because there are many
who owe him a million: his love is worth, a million, and he hopes it
will go for what it is worth, to increase the fund which affluent and
generous persons will subscribe to constitute for the reward of brave
licemen hurt in the execution of their glorious duty, that of protect-
ing his valuable readers.
Political On Dit.
It is rumoured that MR. GATHoRNE HARDy, conscious that those
Gladstophobists, the Tory Dons and Country º, would as soon
have thought of returning MR. BRIGHT as their Representative as
himself, if they had supposed he would have supported a
Reform Bill, has º determined to resign seat as Member
for the University of Oxford.

85.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FEW FRIENDS.
(FROM MY PHOTOGRAPH BOOK.)
LAST TABLEAU.-MY FRENCEI FRIEND.—PROSPECT FOR MY FUNNY
FRIEND.—FINISH.
At the corner of the street, on our way to the Café, lam introduced
by GRIGG to MonsLEUR FARG6, subsequently my French Friend.
It would be more correct to say, that on this very cold day I am in-
troduced to a t-coat and cape, a stout pair of shoes below, a cache-
nez and a .#. hat above, which, taken together, contain
my French Friend. He reminds me, coming upon him in this way, of
a charade; when, for instance, my first is a hat and wrapper, my second
is a great-coat and boots, and my whole is M. FARG#. I don't tell him
this, as I can’t arrange it in French; and, if I could, perhaps he mightn't
like it. GRIgG tells me he’s called several people out for less, and that
he’s a peppery little fellow. He adds that I shall like him well enough
when I know him. I should like to hear some account of his duelling,
and whether he'd ever shot anybody. By the way, to my surprise, I
hear my Funny Friend talking French volubly to this gentleman, and
also to the waiters at the Café, so that his calling me MISTER RosBIF
and MILoRD PLUM-PUDDING in the public streets, with loud observa-
tions in execrable French, is simply unpardonable.
My French Friend º from his chrysalis state of great-coat
shell, is a gay butterfly in bluish coat of a sporting cut, a white waist-
coat, and a tie of many brilliant colours. He is sharp-eyed, eager to
speak, and careless of reply. He has a little pecking habit at table,
arising, probably, from the presence of hors-d'oeuvres in small dishes,
which amuse his leisure time between the courses.
I like meeting him, because it will be admirable practice for my
French. I am a long time about taking off my own upper-coat and
hat, so that, when I do turn to face him in the salle-à-manger, I shall
have a sentence ready in the best possible style to start with. After
that, my future will depend entirely upon him. he says anything
I don't understand, I can only look doubtful, and laugh. ...
This course answers with most people, but not with duellists: won't
do (it suddenly strikes me) to look doubtful and laugh at what may be
(though unintelligible to me) an assertion, made by a man who will
immediately say “Pistols,” and give me his card if I smile when
he’s talking. - -
I approach him, nervously, but determined not to let him have, so
to speak, the first fire. I am going to say something to him about
having a good appetite. I smile at him. He at me. I cough. Now
then: there's no one here; GRIgg is out of earshot, so he can't laugh
at me if I’m wrong, and the waiter (who detects me as an impostor in
French) is out of the room.
A remark about the weather is better for a prelude; he can’t call me
out for saying it’s a cold day. Unless, indeed, he differs with me, and
a "peppery fellow” will quarrel about anything. “Ahem!”. I, say,
rubbing my hands, so as to convey an idea of my meaning, “Il fait
bien froid, n'est-ce pas ?” - -
“Yes,” returns my French Friend, “it is very cold.” And this in
excellent English. I am disappointed, and feel that “Yes, it is,” lacks
brilliancy as a reply. - -
M. FARG6 tells me “he has been in England-lived there, in fact,
during one year and a half.” It is some years since... He likes, much
London. Being on the subject of amusements, he informs me that he
considers the entertainment at the Coal Hole, presided over by BARON
Nicholson, is the fashionable lounge for our sprigs of tºº. l
enlighten him, in spite of GRIGG, who assures him that he is perfectly
correct, and as dinner proceeds we warm towards one another. That
is, he occasionally asks me how I call so-and-so in English, and I
º . compliment by requesting him to name something or other
In trencil.
We must, he says, after the champagne, be his guests during our
stay. Accepted with pleasure. Will we go to the theatre to-night,
for example *, Yes, we will, Then do not trouble yourselves, about
taking places, he says: he will see to that. Shall we take a voiture to
the theatre By all means. We are in the street...We must not, he
says again, trouble ourselves about a voiture: let him get one. We
are, he reminds us, his guests. This is after GRIGG's dinner. I
whisper to GRIGG that his friend is a capital fellow, and that now we
shall see Parisian life, inexpensively. -
We drive to a theatre. My French Friend, who has chatted all the
way about various celebrities, jumps out, and is followed by GRIgg.
I conclude that my French Friend, settles for his guests' cab, so walk
into the theatre. I am summoned back peremptorily by the coachman.
I offer him two francs, which he scouts and enters into a long explana-
tion. I don't understand it, but to save a row give him another franc.
Now this is just what I should have liked my French Friend to have
settled. It’s too bad of GRIgg, at all events, to go on and leave me to
*:: I find them both at the ticket place. -
y French Friend is very lively, he tells me he has settled it, that
he has got three places for us; three of the best stalls. He winks at
me as much as to say his interest here has done this. Isay, “Oh! this
is very kind of you, I’m sure.” He replies, “Not at : not at all.
am at your orders. Look there, the tickets.” The Box office
keeper holds out her hand with three tickets to me. I thank her, and
am about to follow my friends, when she screams out that I haven’t
paid. , I am astonished....“Hasn't my friend paid?”, “No” “Oh!
then how much P’ “Fifteen francs.” 'Pon my soul it’s too bad of
GRIgg. When I find my seat, I am next to my French Friend, who is
delighted to see me again, and congratulates me on having had the
benefit of his assistance in getting such an excellent position. I am a
little hurt, He translates (at GRIGG's request, confound him!) all the
Fº in the play out loud to me, as it proceeds. Itell him twice that
understand it perfectly, but GRIGG on the other side whispers that I
don’t, and my French Friend is very proud of airing his English in the
presence of his fellow-countrymen in the house. I should prefer being
alone and laughing when I like.
Going out of the theatre, between the acts, we meet a flower-girl.
GRIgG addresses me loudly as Monsieur LE PRINCE, and stands before
me, bowing with his hat in his hand, I try to pass him, but the flower-
girl has me fast by the buttonhole, in which she is placing a moss-rose.
A delicate attention. I thank her profoundly, and am about to walk
away when she hopes that MQNSEIGNEUR will not forget her, pecu-
niarily. I give her a franc, and I think I leave her abusing the mean-
ness of Royalty. I beg GRIgg not to play the fool. He complains
that there is no pleasing me. I can’t leave him, as he has my ticket
for re-entry.
After the theatre our French Friend reminds us that we are his
guests, and in his hands. ill we sup? Feeling inclined for this
gaiety, I, say yes, by all means. He walks between us, and says slily
that, he'll take us somewhere. . He himself does not care for supper,
but he knows we English eat always. He will take perhaps a cup of
chocolate, but he adds good-naturedly we can have what we like.
What will we command? ..I say polite # “leave it to him.” GRIgG
says he shall only pick a bit and see me feed. Supper is brought; the
: by mistake, brings for three; I press them to join, they
Consent,
MonstEUR FARGá will show us everywhere to-morrow, and take us
to another theatre. I understand what his taking us means. He
meets a comrade at the Café, who joins us, and is introduced. He
doesn't speak_any English. He is a little, thin man, with a large
moustache. GRIGG tells me it is ALEXANDRE DUMAs. I disbelieve
him; whereupon GRIgG refers me to the waiter for corroboration, or
to our French Friend, who, when asked, replies, Certainly, yes. After
this, I am not astonished to hear that this is a literary Café, and
GRIGG points out, several distinguished people including M. OFFEN-
BACH, who is, curiously enough, humming one of his own airs out of
the Grand Duchess. He subsequently joins us, knowing our French
Friend. I like ALEXANDRE DUMAs; he is still quite a young man,
and apparently very fond of oysters.
Our French Friend calls for the bill; GRIGG says he won’t hear of
his paying it, and hands it over to me.
It is made out for five, including, as I find, what M.OFFENBAch
had before we came in. I don't like to say I won't pay, but I’ll talk
seriously to GRIgG afterwards. (GRIgG, on getting home, by the way,
says it's the regular French custom.) , I am delighted, of course, to
entertain such distinguished visitors, but if I go on at this rate I shall
have to return home in two days. I can't stand ALEXANDRE DUMAs
lſl.
Newt morning. Thorough row with GRIGG, on finding, from published
photographs, that MM. ALEXANDRE DUMAs and OFFENBAcH are totally
different people. I leave to-night. I don't tell GRIgg. I pen a note
to my French Friend, thanking him for his hospitality, and another
for GRIGG (who is out somewhere with him), telling him that I leave
!. bill for him to settle. For once I have the best of him, and
So Ilone.
"." Soon after my arrival in England I meet my Serious Friend, on
whom GRIgg played one of his tricks some months ago. My Serious
Friend, who is not a man to be trifled with, calls every day at GRIGG’s
chambers with a horsewhip. I think I'll write and ask my Funny
Friend to return quickly, as he's wanted on business of importance,
something very much to his advantage. My Serious Friend is six feet
at least, muscular, and determined.
Postscript. There are several Photographs yet in my book, of uncles,
aunts, and cousins, but my Inspection duties under the Olfactory Act
have recommenced; and, moreover, my Great Aunt not being very
well just now, it would not perhaps be advisable to * * * you see * *
family reasons. Some uncles are also ailing. Wait a month or so,
and I may be able to reopen the Photograph, Book, which, for the

PROFESSORS FOR PIGEONS.
THAT eminent member of the Society of Friends—to the Turf–ARGus, thus
writes in the Post with reference to the case of a young nobleman victimised by
usurers, and to a similar case in which usurers were baulked of their prey by a
judgment in Chancery:-
“With this precedent on their side, which may be found in any of the reports, it is to be hoped
that the representatives of Lord JEasey may rescue him from the extraordinary position in which
he is placed at the present moment, for to be charged sixty thousand for the loan of eight is
beyond a joke. I would also submit to the new head-master of Eton the propriety of calling the
attention of his more wealthy pupils, orthose with great expectations, to the above miserable case,
in order that they be cautioned against the jackals of the bill-discounters and the temptations of
their circulars, as by so doing much after-misery might be averted.”
It is to be feared that headmasters of public schools, being clergymen, are,
owing to prejudices of education and calling, too, generally unaccustomed to
enlarge their minds by the perusal of sporting intelligence. in. head-master of
Eton may not perhaps have been used to read the instructive letters of ARGus.
Many a reverend gentleman, too, in scholarship though excelling Joseph ScAll-
GER, may in knowledge of the world be an absolute ignoramus, and perhaps not
even know what a bill-discounter is. Not every head-master of a school may
have the ability to put, a boy up to snuff of the sort mentioned by ARGus. But
there is now before Parliament a Public Schools Bill. Couldn't a clause beintro-
duced into that measure "...f. provision for teaching the young idea
how to shoot aloof from prowling usurers and avoid their snares?. Suppose a
; preceptor were appointed to give the senior pupils at public schools all
needful information on the ways of this wicked world, and especially about the
various rogues, with their arts and devices, who lie in wait to trepan and plunder
#. emight teach them, in periodical lectures, what for example, is the
ifference between honest and dishonest bill discounting, how a rascaily bill-dis.
counter makes his money, how he practises on greenhorns with expectations, and
in what ruinous debt he finally involves them. These lec-
tures might be illustrated with specimens of the letters and
circulars by means of which the money-lendersinyeiglelads
into their clutches, and also with sketches, and if possible
with photographs, of some of those scoun to give the
hearers an ocular idea of what sort a fellow a bill-dis-
counter of the harpy breed generally looks like, so that
they may know one when they see him.
At the Universities, with a view to the inculcation of some
knowledge of life on those who are about to enter it,
the Government, ºf private munificence, would do
well to found Professors º of that desiderated knowledge.
They might be called Professorships of Savey, or, if a title
less trivial than that were required, Prºfessorships of
Practical Experience. With proficiency in this, equal to
their other attainments, men having taken high places in
examinations for honours, would no longer go up to Lon-

I shrunk not, when they summoned me
To swell the censure's blast,
But due tribunal there was none;
No valid judgment passed.
Then since that truth must be confest,
Don't give us cause to say,
Oh the law, the law was broken
By the move of Bishop GRAY.
REFUGE FOR ROGUES.
AppBºssing an audience composed of members of the
Social Science Association, in the lecture-room of the
Society of Arts, DR. LETHEby informed them that:-
“Alum was found in bread to increase the water in it, so that a
sack of flour, instead of making 94 loaves, should make 100, then
water was put into milk, dripping into butter, Ostend butter was
manufactured at Bow—(laughter)-gelatine was ingeniously put upon
isinglass, chicory into coffee, sulphuric acid into vinegar, and tea was
faced with blacklead."
How are we to deal with the shopkeepers who are
guilty of these dishonest practices? Our ancestors had
their ways of dealing with them :-
“In the olden time there existed a law that the trader convicted
of adulterating any article in which he dealt, was made to walk in the
public thoroughfares with a specimen of the article on his breast and I
a label,- This is adulterated, and I'm the fellow that did it.'"
DR. LETHEBy has probably referred to a º couched
in the phraseology of a former period. “Here you may
see a cheate and ye knave that wrought ytt,”.D.R. Lethe-
By went on to say of the fraudulent offender that:
“For the second offence he was drawn on a hurdle, and for the
third he was put into the pillory, and his trading licence was removed."
There may be some reason to regret that modern
refinement forbids us to deal with rogues as our fore-

blacklead would well, deserve to have his own visage
faced in the frame of the pillory with unpleasant missiles.
But the question how to deal with rogues of this de-
scriptionis happily superseded by the discovery ºf the ways
how not to deal with them, by dealing, instead, with Co-

WE THINK THAT THE CRIsis of said NiGHTMARE Is APPROAching FAst.
IT MUST END IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ;
- A VILLAGE IN ARCADIA.
MR. PUNCH lately excited a great deal of black bile by comparing
the Black Country and New Zealand-by no means to the advantage
of the former, as respects the practical savagery of its masses. Without
bating a word he then wrote, he has since admitted that many of the
neglects, abominations and miseries, he had deplored in the region of
coal and iron might be found in other manufacturing districts. Oh,
those dreadful manufacturing districts, Let us fly from them to the
pure air and primitive simplicity of the country! “O Rus quando te
aspician /* me, Gentle Reader, and accompany your Punch in a
ramble through one of these regions of rural .# -
The scene is Terling, an *ś. some distance º: rail-
ways, four miles to the west of Witham, in the famous calf-county,
Essex. e country is flat and moist: water stagnates everywhere in
pools and ditches. The village lies scattered about the sloping banks
of the Ter, a rivulet #ºf into the Blackwater. The houses are
most of them tumble-down lath-and-plaster sheds, on a slight brick
basement; others all of wood, rotten and worm-eaten; a few, more
recent, of brick. The population, about 900, is made up of labourers
on 10s. or 12s., a week, and their families. Fresh meat they rarely
taste; a piece of bacon, or, a herring; even, are occasional luxuries.
Vegetables and bread-and-cheese are the stable diet. -
DR. THORNE, a Medical Inspector of the Privy Council Office,
reports of these Arcadians:-
“From the description which I received of the villagers it appears also that they
have a tendency to isolate themselves, many hardly ever leaving their own parish,
even to visit a neighbouring village, and hence they intermarry to such an extent
that “half the people are related to each other.” They are intellectually and
physically of a low type, there are among them eight or nine idiots and imbecile
children, all seem dull of comprehension, and ‘hardly a well-built man is to be
seen.”. An extraordinarily large number of them are the victims of phthisis and
scrofula ; this may be partly accounted for by the numerous inter-marriages,
partly by the moisture of the soil and the atmosphere, and the entire absence of all
drainage. Ague was very prevalent throughout the neighbourhood until about the
#. 1840, but it is now only seen on rare occasions. There is much intemperance in
he place, illegitimate children abound, sometimes many in one family, and so dis-
tinguishing a merit is it deemed for a girl to marry without being pregnant, that to
each such bride, a principal benefactress of the village is in the habit of giving
a special wedding gift.”
So much for the Arcadians, and now for their Arcadia. -
“At Terling all the nuisances which are generally associated with outbreaks of
typhoid fever exist in great and unusual abundance, and all that is necessary to
produce contamination of air, soil, and water is to be found throughout the village.
The cottages are literally surrounded by every species of nuisance that it is possible
to conceive; slops and ashes are thrown down on the unpaved yards and gardens:
manure heaps, cesspools, and masses of decaying vegetable matter lie round about.
The privies, none of which have a properly constructed tank for the reception of
faecal matter, are in many instances in a most dilapidated state, and owing to their
being frequently constructed of wood, the back is in part broken away, and the
contents either lie in masses on the ground, or else are collected in large holes
which have been dug out for that purpose; and LoRD RAYLEIGH having granted
allotments of ground to his tenants, they cherish and store up these foul accumula-
tions, nominally for the purposes of manure until they assume a magnitude which
none but those who have seen them can believe in. Surrounding one cottage, and
within a circumference of 20 feet of it, I found one pigstye, three manure heaps,
two cesspools, and a privy, the contents of which extended about 12 feet down an
adjoining field."
Note that this passage in the report has the comical side-note—
“Administration of sanitary law in the place.”
Now for the water with which these Arcadians wash down their
vegetarian diet:—
“In the central part of the village, each cottage, or each group of two or three,
has its own well, and if the ground is at all undulating, it is invariably placed at
the lowest point. These wells, which are all sunk in the gravel, are as a rule un-
covered, and are merely lined with bricks placed loosely one above another, without
any cement or plaster; their depth, which varies from about 5 feet to 40 feet, agrees
with the increase in the rise of ground. On a higher level than these wells, and
everywhere surrounding them, lie the various nuisances just enumerated; and
when we remember the loose and porous nature of the soil, and the ease with which
it admits of the percolation of fluids, the closeness of such sources of contamination
to the cottagers' drinking water is seen to be fraught with the greatest danger.
Some of the cottages lying in the outskirts of the village have no wells, and those
who reside in them are therefore compelled to fetch their drinking water from ponds
in the adjoining fields. All the drainage from the field ditches, and at times from
the roadsides runs into them, the cattle frequent them, and in summer they are, to
use the expression of a resident, “nothing better than stinking pools." In only one
instance did I find that the river water was used for drinking purposes, but in this
case at a point where the stream was little better than a sewer.”
Can we wonder iſ King Typhus, looking out for a place for a revel,
should have pitched on Terling? He had paid flying visits to it in his
frequent “progresses” through our happy island, but this time he

sat himself down for right royal disport. On December the 4th he
arrived, and by the 13th of January 208 were down under his heavy
hand. The death-bell tolled perpetually, till, for the sake of the living,
its death-recording voice, was silence Women with tears flowing
down their cheeks, called from their cottage-doors for help. The
fever-stricken lay in almost every house—in many two and three in one
bed, most of them women and children. Typhus was King of Terling-
King without a check on his supremacy, or a curb on his royal will,
But how about those whom the law has placed to keep the ground
against him P
Let DR. THORNE answer:-
“The nuisance authority for the village of Terling is the Board of Guardians of
the Witham Union, and from what I have stated, it must be seen that this authority
had entirely neglected its duty. On the 23rd of December I was present at a º:
of the Board : I explained to them the serious nature of the epidemic which h
broken out in Terling, and pursuant to my instructions urged upon them the ne-
cessity of prompt and energetic action as the only means by which the fever could
possibly be arrested. I ..". directed their attention to the importance of see-
ing, first, that the filth, which was so abundant, should be removed after it had
been disinfected ; secondly, that the inhabitants should at once be provided with a
pure water supply; and thirdly, that means should without delay be adopted to
remedy the overcrowding. The Board º saw the importance of following
the advice given, and immediately gave orders for a large quantity of disinfectants,
which were at once distributed to the cottagers, and applied to the various nuisances.
Permission was also given to all the medical men (not exclusively the parish doctor)
to order wine, brandy, and beef tea to any annount which they thought necessary
for their patients, and the more effectually to carry out these measures a kitchen
was procured where the beef tea was always kept ready made. Unfortunately these
recautions had hitherto been neglected. although the º of adopting them
#. been brought under the notice of the Board. On the 12th of January, 1868,
I again attended a meeting of the Board of Guardians, and it is much to be regretted
that I was obliged to call their attention to the fact, that though they had been
profuse in their supply of disinfectants, they had very seriously neglected the
removal of the nuisances around the cottages, and I informed them that the steps
which they had taken to effect this object were quite inadequate; for though the
disease had then been lasting for six weeks, cesspools could be found full to the brim,
and those which had been emptied were filling again. I explained to them, that,
had they originally performed their duty as a nuisance authority, the epidemic in
Terling would never have occurred, and the lives of the villagers would have been
spared, and that therefore, the least which could now be expected of them was an
energetic performance of their every day duty. The necessary works to supply pure
º: had been ordered by the vestry of Terling, in consequence of a letter
which, accordance with my instructions I had addressed to them; and by .
of preventing a recurrence of this disease by the well-water becoming saturated wit
the contents of privies, Lord RAYLEigh informed me that he was supplying all his
cottages—that is to say, 78 out of the 164 in the village—with properly constructed
bricked cesspools lined with cement, and effectually covered over.”
At least it may be said, if the local authorities had neglected their
duty before the outbreak, they were disposed to show some alacrity in
shutting the door after, the enemy had established himself. But he
had already effected his lodgment, and was not to be easily ousted. In
the interval between the 22nd of December, when DR. THORNE first
visited Terling, and the 29th of January, when he made a second in.
spection, he found, the fever had continued to spread, and had risen
from women and children to able-bodied men and boys. Up to that
date 260 cases had occurred. “Of course,” it will be said, “in spite
of all that the local authorities could do, in the way of strenuous exer-
cise of their powers under the Nuisances Removal Act.”
Let DR. THORNE’s second report answer on this point:—
“Notwithstanding that the urgency of very immediate and prompt action had
been again and again pressed upon the Board of Guardians, I still found abominable
nuisances in Terling, and it is hardly possible to speak in sufficiently strong terms
of the culpable neglect shown by that authority. Fortunately the vestry of the
parish (the Sewer Authority), acting under Sec. 11. of the Sanitary Act 1866, had in
three of the most populous parts of the village provided a pure water supply for the
inhabitants; but to give an example of the mode in which the Board omitted to
perform their ordinary duties, even when the villagers were dying around them, I
would call attention to a nuisance of colossal magnitude situated behind some
cottages on the Upper Green. Within about ten or twelve feet of the back doors
and windows of the cottages in question, is a large ditch in one place nearly two
yards broad, full of stagnant #. Over this ditch four wooden privies are placed,
and their entire contents fall into it; the floor in one of them is nearly broken
away. All the slops from these cottages are also poured into the ditch, and for a
space of between fifty and sixty yards a foul urinous fluid with faecal matter floating
on its surface, lay soaking into the porous soil on which the cottages are built, and
emitting a stench which I, in common with two companions easily detected at a
distance of 100 yards. This abominable nuisance has been the subject of much
discussion: twice I formally brought it under the notice of the Board, and on two
occasions I pointed it out to the officers of the authorities, especially on account of
the existence of fever in the adjoining cottages, but, unfortunately, on the 29th of
January it was in the same state as when I first drew attention to it. Evidently the
main object at which this local authority has aimed is not so much to remove with
an exemplary haste all possible sources of disease in Terling, as to give the public
an impression that it has already done so; whereas, in reality, the present sanitary
condition of the village would disgraceful, even if this vast epidemic had not
rooted itself so deeply on the spot. In no single instance could I ascertain that the
Board of Guardians had been instrumental in causing a properly constructed cess-
pool to be made.”
id: º :* principle is “Local Self-Government,” and BUMBLE is
lts pro -
1. private benevolence has done and is doing its best to
supply the shortcomings of local officialism :—
“Fortunately for the sufferers,” says DR. Thorne, “immense private efforts
have been made for their relief. Terling Place has been, to use the expression of an
inhabitant, “an open house;’ wine, brandy, beef tea, milk, and luxuries have been
liberally supp from that residence, and DR. GIMson who has without official
obligation, given up almost all his time in attending to the sick, informed me that,
at Lord and Lady RAYLEIGH’s expense, the poor were provided with every requisite,
' and had their linen washed for them. In addition to this, as the Nuisance
Authority had made no attempt to remedy the overcrowding, Lond RAYLEigh had
fitted up the village school as a convalescent hospital for children ; these were
brought to it in a covered waggon, and on their arrival they were stripped and
washed, then entirely reclothed with garments provided by private individuals, and
placed under the care of a lady nurse. Sisters from St. Margaret's Home, East
Grinstead, were superintending the nursing throughout the village, and spending
their nights with the most dangerous cases.”
If King Typhus be finally driven out of Terling, he need not go far
for his next “Grand Court.”. He has, only to move four miles east-
ward to Witham, which DR. Thorne thus describes:–
“Witham is a small town, containing about 3500 inhabitants, and is the only
º: in this Union which is governed by a Local Board of Health. The main streets
ave an appearance of great cleanliness and comfort; but on passing from them into
courts and slums which are hidden from the general view, cesspools, dilapidated pri-
vies, with their contents running about the yards and gardens, heaps of decaying
animal and vegetable matter, and every species of nuisance can be found in abund-
ance. Some of the inhabitants live in hovels of the most miserable description, where
they are surrounded by intolerable stenches, and, I was informed that they dare not
complain to their landlords or to the Inspector of Nuisances of the filthiness around
them, for if they go to the former they fear that he will turn them out of their
houses, whereas the latter is the relieving officer, and it is their belief that any
complaints made to him would go far to prevent their receiving parish relief. But
a more serious obstacle even than this exists to any sanitary improvement. The
}. on which the worst nuisances exist belong to members of the Local
oard, and I would especially allude to several groups of cottages belonging to a
MR. ToMAs.IN, the stinking nuisances around which render them unfit for human
habitation. MR. ToMAsiN is a gentleman of large fortune, he has a seat at the Local
Board, and yet so much has he neglected the dwellings of the poor which belong to
him, that the magistrates have been compelled to summon him before them, in
order to force him to remove nuisances on his cottage property.”
Bravo, again, Local Self-Government! There is a clause in the
Sanitary Act of 1866, empowering the SECRETARY OF STATE to inquire
into cases where Local Authorities neglect their duty, to make order
on them for the performance of that §§ and on non-compliance with
that order, to º a person to do the necessary work. Has this
clause been invoked, or put in operation, in this case, or in the many
similar cases And if not, why not *
The question should be asked where an answer can be insisted upon.

The Upper House (when the Reporters were out.)
THE Bishop of LoNDoN said it didn’t seem to be any good their
talking about Ritualism, as no one attended to them.
The Bishop of Oxford thought that the present time was one when
more than ever great caution and Christian forbearance was necessary.
(Hear, hear!)
The Bishop of SALISBURY observed that he'd like to speak out
boldly, and say what were and what were not the doctrines he held.
But!perhaps it was better at present to agree with his Right Rev.
Brother, the Bishop of Oxford.
The Bishop of LICHFIELD regretted that some parties went too far,
and others not far enough. For his own part, he was willing to con-
cede, a great deal to either party. It was to be wished that a definite
conclusion could be arrived at on some point, either as to DR. Colºnso
or Ritualism. In the meantime, he would urge the necessity of a
careful policy.
The Bishop of Ely was sorry to hear what his Right Rev. Brother
of London had let fall. There must always be differences of opinion,
and at latitude must be allowed to Members of the English
Church. (Hear ſ As the Bishops did not agree on essential points, and
Heaven forbid they should, why compel the inferior clergy to assent
to an uncertainty?, He was perhaps a little confused, but on the whole
he had always found it the safest course to sº with his Right Rev.

pardon. (Hear, hear!)
The ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY rose to say he was astonished to
hear any Member of that House express an opinion that every Rubric

went together, and the action of Parliament would not be called in as
long as Convocation continued its present safe course,

what the original motion was, DR. TAIT was understood to say, quietly,
that it was of no consequence, as, in his experience, the result was the

In the Lower House, a vote of thanks was proposed to the ARCH-
Bishop of CANTERBURy for having written to the Greek Church.
DEAN STANLEY said that an Epistle to the Greeks of course found
its precedent in the Epistle to the Romans, to whom, however, he was
sorry the ARchbishop had not written. He thought letter-writing
mischievous as a rule; but, at all events, the present amiable corre-
spondence would amuse the Easterns, and wouldn't hurt us, and so he
should concur in thanking the Archbishop for nothing. By the
way, of course, the House knew that the English Church was anathe-
matised implicitly, if not explicitly, by the Greeks.
ARCHDEACON DENISON said that it didn’t matter. It was a great
thing to have written a letter at all. It showed life. There was too

was his maiden speech, and it
was clear and to the point;
| “without o'erflowing, full.” more
| or rather less than can be said of his old friend the Ness, which has
| lately been misconducting itself riotously, and nearly drowning the

This is the Tory-Radical Reform for Scotland.

2. A £12 rateable holding in Counties, or
3. A £5 ownership occupation gives
4. No Re-distribution.º.But -
5. Seven new Members to Scotland, namely, two to the Univer-
sities, the Counties of Aberdeen, Ayr, and Lanark, one each,
Glasgow to have a cocked-hat member, and divers Boroughs,
Wishaw, Kirkintilloch, &c., are joined, and have the seventh.
The Scotch Members, mostly, said, and such of the Scotch papers as
we have seen echo the remark, that the Bill is rather worse than that
of last year. Some suggested waiting to see what a new Parliament
would do, but MR. DISRAELI warned them against, that kind of Jack
O'Lantern. MR. S.MolleTT and MR. LAING defended the Bill.
There was a smart little passage of arms between MR. S.Mollett and
MR. REARDox, an Irish Member. The Scot thought that as the popu-
lation of Ireland had diminished, she did not want so many Members,
and also observed that though the Scotch were coarse and democratic
they were loyal, and did not make patriots and martyrs out of hanged
murderers. The Irishman replied, that Irishmen had never sold their
King, nor abandoned their flag on the field of battle. These arguments

In the Lords it was asked whether there were any floating batteries
being provided for the defence of the Coasts, and it was answered that
such things would cost £7,000,000, and could not be afforded. To do
the French nation justice, its Executive would not dare to make such
an answer to such a question.
Tuesday, The CHANCELLOR explained what he had meant by Promis-
sory Oaths. He referred to those which are taken by persons on
admission to offices. He did not mean the profane and improper
language used when the old woman in charge of an office has kept her
unexpected employer a long time at the door, but the vows on entering
situations. There are about 300 pages full of these oaths in the report
that recommends abolition. Only tremendous official swells are to
swear in future—also soldiers and constables. But no clause affects
those who are addicted to swear in verba magistri, and when that
Master is Mr. Punch, it is the best thing they can do.
Brompton Boilers are to be erected in Bethnal Green, as the poor

In.
Wednesday. , Deputations of bank clerks and other inferior beings
beg that the day after Christmas Day may be a Bank holiday, and
that the QUEEN may be able to proclaim a Bank holiday without an
Act. Into a plan for this purpose, MR. C. O'Loghien inserts a
clause making bills and notes that fall due on Sundays or holidays
payable the day after, not the day before. But the great City men
oppose the measure. “It is a serious thing,” said MR. GoschEN,
“to stop the commerce of the City for even one day.” “The paucity
of holidays in Protestant countries,” said MR. Thomas BARING, “gives
them a commercial advantage.” A Select Committee, however, is to
consider the Bill...MR. MLAREN, Member for Edinburgh, made a
singular and startling revelation. He said that “the Scotch, being
Presbyterians, knew nothing at all about Good Friday.” We had fan-
cied-from early impressions of hastily read history, perhaps—that the
Scotch were some sort of Christians.
MR. LEFEvae introduced a Bill to this end. You assure your life.
Qf course you do. It is the duty of any man with a wife and family,
if his income is derived from his own exertions. But you want to
keep this provision safe for those whom you care about. There are
two ways of effecting this. One is by paying all your creditors before
you die, and this is a very good way, only sometimes there are difficul-
ties., The other is by assignment, but it involves questions, and is not
absolutely safe. It is proposed to revive the practice of assignment
by nomination on the º The representatives of trade object, on
the part of creditors, but a moralist may at least ask whether a wife
and children, suddenly left helpless, ought not to be considered as
lawful Preference Creditors, in a society which very properly holds
marriage to be the Duty of Man. Still, young people, keep out or get
out of debt. Owe nothing but grudges, which you can pay at conve-
nience, or never pay at all.
And, now we come to MR. GLApstone, who selected this day for a
feat, which will be remembered. If the Church Rate question be not
settled now, it will be the fault of so-called friends of the Church. He
would put the Rate to death as Cæsar's slayers dealt with him,
“We'll carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcase for the hounds."
All MR. GLADSTONE proposes is, that there shall be no legal power to
levy the rate on all inhabitants, but that those only shall be taxed who
come forward and offer to subscribe. . The machinery shall be pre-
served, in order to meet the feelings of Churchmen, but it shall have
no compulsory power. This is really, as MR. CHARIES MATHEws said
in that beautiful and sparkling, composition, Anything for a Change,
“killing a fellow so gently, that he must rather like it than otherwise.”
Even LoRD CRANBoRNE held that the Church should accept this. Bill,
and avoid worse things at the hands of a Parliament of Radicals.
Government reserved itself, MR. HARDY thinking that it was for the
Dissenter to come forward and proclaim his wicked schism. The Bill
was read a Second Time. - -
The Solicitor-GENERAL was re-elected for Helston without a fight.
But the Government lost a seat at Stoke, where MR. MELLY got into
MR. Hope's vacant seat. , Sic vos non vobis Mellyficatis, gentlemen
Conservatives.
Thursday. Nothing noteworthy, save that MR. DISRAELI, questioned
y MR. WHALLEY and MR. DARBY GRIFFITH as, to Abyssinian
Expenses, deigned only the curtest intimation to those illustrious
Senators, that he had no reason to believe that his general estimate
had been exceeded. He is right not to be too credulous, but there
may be something in what is stated by the Correspondents.
Friday. There was to have been a Boys' Night with Ireland, but
the juvenile fête was postponed until the next Tuesday. , MASTERs
CLINToN, AMBERLEY, GLAdstone, and other interesting lads, were
then to let off their little fireworks, after a lecture by MR. Maguiº.
The chief incident of the night was an elaborate exposure, by MR.

EXCELSIOR'ſ
THE chains of Trade were falling fast,
As to the Tory benches passed , .
A youth, through social snow and ice,
Who bore a flag with the device-
l “Excelsiorſ”
His brow was brass: his eye, beneath,
Slept like a daggerin its sheath;
;: 'twixt the stabs of his keen tongue,
Everin under-tone there Tung-
“Excelsior "
He smote his foememblack-and-blue,
#is friends he served, a henchman true;
He turned from Truth’s white-mountain-throme,
And upwards pressed, with stifled groan-
“Excelsior f*
“Try not that road!”. Experience said,
“Truth's rocks hang threatening o'erthy head;
The stream of Proof runs deep and wide.”
But, firm, that stubborn voice replied,
“Excelsior'."
“Oh, stay” fair Fiction cried, “and rest
Aliºrelled head upon my breast !”
A flash awoke his slumbrous eye,
JBut faded, as he gave reply,
“Excelsior l’
**Ware Toryism's rotten branch
*Ware democratic avalanche'" -
Such was calm Caution's last good-night:
A voice replied, from Treasury height,
“Excelsior l’”
As Tory Chieftains officeward
Expectant turned their keen regard,
Discussing chances, hopes, and fears,
His voice burst on their startled ears-
“Excelsior ”
There, on Ambition's topmost round,
This climber at his goal was found,
Triumphant over snow and ice,
True to his flag and its device,
“Excelsior'''
For all his triumph, in cold blood,
Passionless, but not proud, he stood:
As from truth's peaks, crowned with her star,
A proud voice rang above far,
“Excelsior'."
ONLY A PEG.
WE read in the Star:—
“The HoN. F. STANLEY, M.P., wounded his hand by slapping a chisel whilst
engaged in joinering, of which he is very fond. The wound, though very severe, is
rapidly healing.”
“Slapping” is probably a misprint for “snapping,” but never mind
that. MR. STANLEY is getting well, we don’t mind telling him that
he must have paid very little attention to the instructions of his
father, that eminent Cabinet-maker—and this gives us an opportunity
of expressing our satisfaction that the EARL OF DERBY is recovering
ºr. Punch hopes to “play many a brother's wager frankly”
w1 -
The Westments Divided Against Themselves.
THE Justice of the Supreme Court of Natal, who has pronounced for
the validity of Bishop ColeNso's letters patent, is called “Cope.”
This is a great blow to Bishop GRAY and the Ritualists who sup-
port him. It is a case of Cope against Chasuble, Dalmatic, Alb, and
Tunic all put together. “Hammer and tongs” is a trifle to such
inter-vestment-ine warfarel
FRENCH ASSES ON THEIR ARMY BILL.
BEING happily, for the present, at peace with all the world, France
merely wants a loan of four hundred million francs or so, which, her
Ministry confess, are to be chiefly spent in armaments. Only see what
a blessing it is to live a peaceful life, and to have no thought of worry-
ing one's neighbours!. The financier, M, MAGNE, is so happy in his
mind at the prospect of tranquillity that he actually is able to make a
little joke in the midst of his arithmetic. If faithfully reported, he tells
us that the present small addition of four hundred and forty million
francs to the Consolidés is solely for the purpose of “consolidating
ce.”. It is entirely for this object that the large army of France is
rgely to be increased. Some people may fancy that a big army, kept
idle, might be clamorous for war, but M. MAGNE has happily no such
foolish apprehension. Nor has he any fear that French braggarts may
make mischief by talking stuff like this :—
“By sometimes inspiring terror, France has always made herself respected; and
for my part I would not permit a single stroke of policy to stake place in Europe
without our permission.”
So brayed BARON BRENNIER, in the debate upon the Army Bill; and
many a French jackass will probably lift up his voice in this same key.
GENERAL Count DE LARUE, for instance, was pleased to echo, thus:–
“A nation like France must be assured of maintaining its preponderance abroad
and its security at home.”
. A reign of “terror” and “preponderance;” this, according to these
jackasses is, or ought to be, the aim of the EMPERoRoy FRANce. What
will be the cost of it no donkey ever calculates. Some asses even
fancy, or at least pretend to fancy, that great armies are, on grounds of
mere economy, good things. Hear, for instance, M. RoulanD :—
“As to the economical objection, I say that commerce and industry require pro-
tection and security, and for this object force is necessary to repel aggression. The
additional cost is an economical outlay, and the commercial class and the country
are well aware of this. When the country is strong, thanks to the patriotism and
prudence of the EMPEROR, then industry and business may in
| security, and disquietude will disappear.”
“When the country is strong,” i.e. has a million soldiers idle and
waiting for a war, there is everywhere a dearth of labourers and crafts-
men, and works of commerce and of agriculture languish and die out.
In France, not less than England, “the commercial class and country
are well aware of this.” Hence the new French Army Bill is univer-
|sally regarded as a bitter pill to swallow, and in spite of all the sugary
speeches of the Senators, the French will make wry faces before they
gulp it down.
“THE BOOK OF THE FARM.”
ONE of the Reviews of DARwin's New Work, after quoting the
subject of the Second Volume, remarks:—“To all º Gentle-
men, Farmers, and Breeders, these chapters will be as full of light and
interest as to all Biologists and Speculative Thinkers.” Does any pro-
fane person doubt it? “Country gentlemen,” of the finest old-crusted
Tory politics'and viewson education, &c., are fartoo solemnatheme to be
treated with levity; but “farmers and breeders”—are they generally
the classmates of “Biologists and Speculative Thinkers?” Old John
Stockwell, of Bathley Wood Farm, as good a judge of a beast as any
man in Midlandshire, hears of this wonderful new book of MR.
DARwiN's, perhaps at the Market Table at the “Clumber Arms,”
where nothing else is talked about but “The Variation of Animals and
Plants under Domestication,” rides home, borrows the two stout
volumes from his clergyman, who is scientific, and subscribes to a
London Library, and in the company of his pipe, and with the stimulus
of some brandy-and-water, examines them for information about the
best method of crossing sheep. Let us look over his shoulder. “The
laws of Inheritance and Reversion (Atavism) in Praepotency and Limi-
tation of Sex.” STockwell's education closed at fourteen, his reading
since has not been varied or extensive, and the character of his hand-
writing is rude : he makes a conscientious effort to master the poly-
syllabic difficulties, but fails, Atavism in particular, which is delusively
placed within brackets as though it were a simple and explanatory term,
meaning possibly great-grandmotherism, proving an impassable barrier.
He tries again—“Hybridism”—and gets another tumble. Full of
Pluck, he puts all his mind at what proves a regular stone wall–
‘Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis,”—which so completely floors
him, that he throws DARwn down, is quite laborious with his pipe,
empties his tumbler, takes off his boots, and as he goes up-stairs to bed,
resolves never again to stray away from Old Moore, the weather-glass,
and Bell's Weekly Messenger.
Saturday Afternoon.

An instrumental gentleman,
Facetiously inclined, -
Doth stick and stand and stare at 'em,
And thus he speaks his mind:
“THE TENOR AND THE BARITONE
ARE FIGHTING FOR THE CROWN ;
I’D LIKE To KICK THE BARITONE,
AND Knock THE TENOR Down!”
A TRUTH FROM THE HUSTINGS.
THERE was one sentence in the speech of MR. LEA (the Candidate
for Helston, who showed at the hustings, but not at the Poll, in oppo;
sition to Mä. BRETT) which, strange to say of anything in a hustings'
speech, is, at once, new and true. -
When offering bribes to the Helstonians allround, in the shape of all
manner of local improvements and benefits, to be secured by electing him,
MR. LEA crowned the list, which included cheap gas, a railway, a free
library, and general prosperity, by the paramount blessing—dwarfing all
the others—of his own Establishment at Dartmoor in the Goose Trade l'
We should infer, en passant, from MR. IBA's speech throughout,
that he had been accustomed to deal with, if not in, Geese, all his life.
So that, probably, what he contemplates on oor is an extension
or branch of his regular business. To this most tempting promise
MR. LEA tacked on a confession. “Talk about Geese, I will make
money out of them, if you will let me.” This sentence Qught evidently
to be read with an accent on the “you,” like that laid on “him” by
Joe Miller's well-known preacher, in giving out the text. “And he
said, ‘Saddle me the ass,” and º saddled him.” This outburst of
MR. LEA's we take to be about the most candid thing ever spoken
from a hustings. How many Candidates for Parliament come forward
with this intention of making money out of Geese, if the Geese will
let them! How few have had the honesty to avow the design totidem
verbis like MR. LEA at Helston |
Cut Out.
TRUMPINGTON, who is miserable without his rubber, finding every

all round.
HOW TO STOP STREET.BEGGING.
Fourscope and one beggars brought to one London Police Court
within one single week! A pretty little problem is suggested by the
fact. How many beggars, would you calculate, are begging now in
London, when to one of its Police Courts no fewer than fourscore and
one are brought at one fell swoop?. Another problem to be solved is
how the streets may best be cleared of them, and on this point SIR. R.
CARDEN, the Magistrate in question, has put forth some good sense:–
“In this country there should not be a beggar in the streets, and there would
not be one if everybody would abstain for one week from giving money in the
streets, and give into custody every one that solicits alms, have the cases investi-
gated, and see them provided for. This is the duty of humanity. By giving alms
you only perpetuate the misery."
In its efforts to stop begging, the Mendicity Society has done the
state some service, and we should like to see it aided by an Anti-Beggar
League, or a Society for Total Abstinence from Giving Money in the
Streets. Almsgiving encourages both idleness and vice, and, though
it pleases sentimentalists, it does no one real good. DEAN SwiFT pro-
posed that beggars should, by law, be forced to wear a badge, and the
suggestion may seem suitable to those who have been badgered by
them. Impostors fittingly might wear the Order of the Fleece, and,
when known, it might help somewhat to check, their imposition. But
if people would abstain from selfishly indulging in the weakness of
street almsgiving, our pavements would be cleared of the impostors
who infest them. Idle beggars would be driven to be usefully indus-
trious, and money worse than wasted on them might be spent in really
useful charitable works.

Bowler, MR. ToM RQ-
BERTson, and, delivers, his
fourth ball during Miss
MARIE WILTON's success-
ful innings on" the little
Prince of Wales's Ground,
Tottenham Court Road,
which locality has by this
time, judging from the stall
and box audience, a good
deal more of the Court

“How's that, umpire P’.
A hit, a palpable hit, and
the piquante Manageress
(did she ever look more
charming than in this new
piece? Ah, me!) will make
a good score, to be added
to the previous runs. MR.
BANCROFT's hair , is a
triumph of art; and so is
. . . MR HARE's wig. The suck
cess, however, of the piece, which is faulty in construction and
"tricky” in its effects, is, in our opinion, at least two-thirds, due to
the admirable acting of Miss WILTON, Miss LYDIA Foote, and MESSRs.
Bºjijani Monrºque. The two ordinary comic characters
(well played by MRs. MURRAY and MR. BLAKELEy) are too prominent,
and might be even now advantageously toned down, specially, in
the last Act. With this º no other company in London
could have done so well for their author, as did that of the Prince
of Wales's Theatre, and, we believe, at no other theatre could "Play
have achieved the same success, or jumped so suddenly intº public
favour. Great praise is due to Messrs. MontgomERY and SYDNEY
for their performance of two Prussian officers, character bits which,
in less clever hands, might have marred the good fortune of the piece.
The costumes of the ladies appear to have been taken from
MARCELIN’s sketches of the Porte St. Martin Ballets in his journal La
Wie Parisienne. But, as it now appears, given the Prince of Wales's
Company, with MR. Robertson as author, and the result is certain.

SCENE.-The Interior of the Prince of Wales's Theatre. View of Stage
from the Stalls. First night of new piece, when everybody knows every-
body else, and for appropriate music might be played, “We’re all
Nodding,” to one another, and asking “how d'ye do?” “How are
you?” with a here-we-are-as-large-as-life sort of air, and a general
assumption of importance as much as to say, individually, upon me
depends the fate of an empire this night. We, the audience, are the
“I(ind Friends in Front,” who used to be so humbly alluded to by
the dramatist in his trembling tag—a fashion now happily dying out.
Inquiring Person (reading the bill to his friend, a well-educated person,
in Stalls.) There’s a lot of German here, what’s it mean? Der Brunnen,

the bill (hopes that'll help him; reads, and is inspired.) Of course, there's
the translation at the side—Act II: Das alte Schloss? Afternoon l'.
Inquiring Person explains to another Inquiring Person afterwards thus:
Good idea, isn't it, writing the time of day in German? Yes, Der
Brunnen means “morning,” Das alte Schloss “afternoon”—the trans-
lation's at the side; Der Worplats is, “evening,”—queer word for
evening, isn't it Der Spielsaal, “Night,” and Der Kursaal und Kur-
garten “The next day.” It’s all there, you see.
[Friend is much obliged, and uses his knowledge freely.

A VERY PRETTY SCENE.-Vague German people grouped about, zll
standing quite still, as if waiting for something or somebody. . As
somebody doesn't come, and nothing happens, they burst into sudden
life, and show each other the shortest route off the stage, so that the

DEAR MR. PUNCH, Q
I ReAD the paper; and find man |. in them, this for
example—“New Queen's Counsel. The following Members, of the
Bar are, we understand, to receive the honour of a silk gown.” . And
then the names of the recipients-elect of silk gowns are given, to the
great amusement, I imagine, of their wives, daughters, and other
female relatives, to the great wonderment, I am sure, of ºf If it
had been a silk handkerchief, or a silk scarf, or a silk umbrella, I should
not have been so much surprised, *:: I might have wondered
how such a present could be a mark of honour. But a silk gown!
Could not Government—for I *Poºr it is Government—have thought
of something rather more useful ? An opera-glass, for instance, or a
set of studs, or a gold pencil-case ? For what can these gentlemen do
with a silk gown P Give it away, I suppose, with a great fuss, to
their wives, if they are married, or to their laundresses, if they are
wretched Maledicts, existing in chambers on the top of those gloomy
staircases, where I used to lunch once or twice in the season, when
my cousin, FRED WIGMORE, lived in Gray's Inn, before he went out to
Sierra Leone as a judge, and caught the yellow fever there, and had to
come home, and married HESTER MAINWARING who hadn’t, a penny,
and took to farming, and buried himself in a village where there were
only two hundred people and no squire, and the clergyman came to do

|tions, but can you (or perhaps dear. MRs. P.) tell me how the gowns
are made, whether plain skirts, or trimmed? Are they all of the same
colour, and what is it? Are they checks, or stripes, or without any
attern at all? Moiré, or watered, or plain rich Lyons? ...Who pays
or them P Do we (I am unmarried, property at my own disposal, no
trustees), out of the Income-Tax? ijó Government buy upremnants at
the end of the season, or is the newest material and the latest fashion
selected by the LoRD CHANCELLOR and the rest of the Judges, who
take their wives to Lewis AND ALLENBy’s to choose these silks? And
are these Counsel of the QUEEN’s presented to HER MAJESTY in their
new gowns, and can she keep her countenance? Perhaps, they match
the knights who, I see, are to appear, at the Levée, in their collars.
| I could not help reflecting how amused the intelligent Abyssinian
would be when he read about these honourable silk gowns, which no
doubt he will think are as much admired and prized f our great men,
as red cloaks are by his chiefs and warriors. But I must not take
up your time any longer, just now, especially, when, you have so much
to think about and advise upon with Ministers and the Co-operative
| Stores, and Bishop ColeNso, and the Spring fashions.
Yours, dear Mr. Punch, affectionately,

I cannot eat the old horse
I rode long years ago;
I’m sure my teeth would fail me,
And foolish tears might flow.
For bygone hunts come o'er my heart
With cuts from round and side,
I cannot eat the old horse
On which I used to ride. }
I cannot eat the old horse,

PARLIAMENTARY NOTES.
ONE WORD FROM MY FUNNY FRIEND.
GRIGG, my Funny Friend, in answer to numerous inquiries, wishes,
through the present popular medium, to intimate to his friends and
patrons that he intends establishing a SocIETY FoR THE PROMotion of
PRACTICAL JokING:
Subscriptions will be received by him at his private residence until
THE School of DESIGN is built and ready for use.
He can at present only place before his admiring friends and patrons
a rough sketch, or mere outline, of the future plans, and will at the
same time attempt to convey some notion of the Educational Scheme
which he intends that his pupils should adopt.
N.B. He further, takes this opportunity of announcing that he has
by him a stock of first-rate tricks on Elderly Gentlemen, Elderly
Ladies, Butlers, and Policemen, which, requiring no sort of mecha.
nical apparatus or elaborate preparation, are calculated to cause
as mugh, amusement as the, now worn-out witticism of putting a
basin full of water or a coal-scuttle on the top of a partially open
door, or the classic extravagance of placing the steel barrels of small
musical-boxes in your grandfather's bed.
N.B., N.B., Parties attended with all sorts of practical jokes. Lec-
tures given at private houses to the younger members of the family.
Grown-up pupils three guineas a quarter, which will include two tricks
with gunpowder.
The Onion-Seed trick, the Magic Match, always on hand. (Wide next
Number.). Reduction made on taking a quantity.
Open-air exercise will not be neglected.
The Runaway Knock and Ring will be taught practically from 1 to
2 P.M., and 11 to 12 P.M. No danger.
The Wild Horse, or “Am dat you, Ginger ?” How to rattle your
hat, &c, &c. This will be shown while the lecturer is out for recrea-
tion in the Park with his more advanced pupils.
Evenings, at Home. The Domestic Circle. How to mix whiskey-
toddy, so that it will explode on being touched with a spoon, break the
glass, the lamps, and any crockery in the room.
Warranted GREAT FUN. One Turn, Two Guineas.
The Plan of ". with the Hours of Lectures, my Funny
Friend will have great pleasure in furnishing as soon as possible.

INTERNATIONAL COINAGE.
A CoMMIssion has been appointed to consider the question of Inter-
national coinage. The Astronomer-Royal is on it. His duty will be
to detect by means of his 'best telescope the ºff" weights. On the
excellent Secretary, MR. RIVERS WILSON, will devolve the duty of
. each national coin in the English fashion, i.e., the ordeal by
iting.
The Commission will occupy its first day by tossing for centimes until
they’ve reduced themselves to a common denomination. As the Shilling
is likely to be abolished, Mr. Punch proposes establishing an office, his
own in Fleet Street will do to begin with, where all the shillings will
be called in, and full value up to sixpence given for each one.
Sympathies with Respect to Shot.
UNDER the title of “L’Empereur et le Soldat,” an article in the
| “Foreign Office Agencies.”—Always questionable, too often mis-Moniteur contains, according to a contemporary, the passage following:
chievous.
“Capital Punishment Inside Prisons.”—Hard labour (for lazy rogues),
and the Cat (for Wife-beaters, Child-starvers, and Garotters).
| : Corrupt Practices at Elections Bill.”—Ten to one, an attorney's.
“Precautions against Cattle Plague.”—Proper stowage on the voyage,
clean water, wholesome food, and decent treatment after it.
“Short Bill for the Removal of Nuisances.”—Take away that Bumble /
ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION.—In Meteorology.
|, “When a regiment passes, the clarion vibrates in the heart, the drum quickens
the step, the eye grows proud, the hand is impatient to grasp arms. Men become
animated and sympathise with the flag torn by the bullet."
| Do they? No doubt some men do sympathise with the flag torn by
the bullet. Others are rather disposed to conceive sympathy with the
flesh torn by the bullet, and with the bones which it smashes.

To MR. BEALEs.
MR. BEALes, accept a compliment from Mr. Punch who, you will
admit, has not precisely plastered 5. with eulogy...At a meeting of
the Council of the Reform Leagueſast week, a resºlution was proposed
in favour of the instant destruction of the Irish Church. You ap-
proved the proposal, but you demanded that vested interests should be
respected, and compensation, provided. You,were, yelled down, and
the Irish Clergy were called “thieves and robbers.”. You were indig-
nant, but the Bubblyjocks were your masters, and the motiºn, for
destruction, “without regard to wested interests,” was carried by a
large majority. You insisted, on recording your protest against dis-
onesty. Accept Mr. Punch's compliment. Protest again when the
Bubblyjocks carry a resolution for the obliteration of a National Debt
incurred by aristocrats for tyrannic purposes. Protest for the third
time when the Bubblyjocks carry a resolution that you have had your
own comfortable house long enough, and qught to resign it, without
compensation, to some Citizen Bubblyjock who is tired of his own
garret. Then abdicate; and, if you have *ś to do, take to
a crossing. It would be far more respectable than being the tool of
men who could carry the resolution of last week, and who have thereby
added their meeting-place to the list of Thieves' Kitchens.

“HANG HIM, FOUL COLLIER!”
WE prefix this quotation only to 'show our clever-
ness, as SIR Robert Collie R is not foul, and had
not the least desire to MR. EYRE. But, in-
structed by that Jamaica. Committee, who cannot
forgive MR. EYRE for having saved the island, and
extirpated a pestilent cunning fanatic by means which
were legally irregular, SIRRoBERT has applied at
Bow Street for a warrant to try whether the deci-

of MR.EYRE., SIR THoMAs HENRY refused the
warrant. As there was no case against the “prin-
cipals,” who hung GoRDON, of course there was
none against the “accessory.” Will EYRE's per-
secutors never understand “us English.”. When,

stamps out firebrands, the English nature is much

thing in the wrong way. We are the most law-loving
people in the world, but we are not prigs and pedants,
and as BURKE said, “when a neighbour's house is on
fire, we do not think it amiss should engines play a
little on our own.”. We admit that it would have
been better had “MR.” GoRDoN been disposed of
with , the same regularity as “MR.” GREENACRE,
but this is no reason for such persistent persecution
§ an officer who endeavoured to do his best for his
UEEN.
There is a passage in the Scouring of the White
Horse, a delightſul book written by MR. THOMAs
HUGHES, M.P., a gentleman known to MR. EYRE’s
persecutors, which is as follows. Speaking of the
Governor of the East Angles (and the moral would
be the same if the people had lived in the West), MR.
HUGHEs says, “It is a pity he did not on this occa-
sion remember that having caught a great scoundrel,
the best thing to do with him was to see him hung
out of the way himself.” That’s all.
CIVILISATION RECEDING.
THERE are not a few persons who will derive high gratification from
the sign of the times thus announced by contemporaries:—
“THE PENALTY of DEATH IN Switzen LAND.—The Grand Council of the canton
of Friburg has just re-established the penalty of death, which was abolished 20
years ago. Out of 85 votes, 51 supported the re-introduction.”
Twenty years ago and more there was a very Fº persuasion that
mankind had arrived at the commencement of a new era, in which
loving kindness would subdue brutality, and overcome evil with good.
Enthusiasts went about predicting that there would soon be an end of
war, and of capital punishment. We said at the time they would find
themselves mistaken. So they do. We have had, in spite of your
Great Exhibitions, which were to knit mankind in universal brother-
hood, but didn’t, a Crimean War, and an Indian Mutiny, an American
Civil War, and a War for German Unity, not to mention an Insurrec-
tion stamped out in Jamaica. The crime of murder has increased, to
the proportionate increase of executions. Obstinate, and determined
treason going on to assassination has necessitated hanging, here in
England. And now, after twenty’ years trial of secondary punishment
: jºriend, it has been found necessary to re-establish the penalty
OI Clealil.
-
The abolition of capital punishment has proved a failure. So -
for you, mawkish sentimentalists. , Let us have no more C
amiable aspirations. As the world always has it is, J it
always will be. There is no hope that war will , and tºº we
shall ever be able to do without the gallows. Hoºray!, The substance
of the foregoing remarks will doubtless seemº: to many of our
friends, who are accustomed to enjoy the versation, or recreate
themselves with the writings, of strongminded but impassioned pessi-
: to whom all evidence of the backward march of humanity is
Cneering.

100 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARCH 7, 1868.
CALL THAT A MEDAL P
> HE interesting and imposing ceremonial depicted
in the annexed engraving was in this wise: ... Mr.
Punch himself honoured the French Exhibition,
the Gasometer, the Ovals, the Ellipses, or what-
ever you may like to call theº by permitting
his statue, exquisitely executed, to dominate over
a sumptuous cabinet—it deserves no humbler name
—on whose spiral columns were inscribed. Names
of Power, and on whose tablets were displayed
marvels of art, pictorial and typographic. This was the gem of the
Exhibition, and while myriads crowded to behold it (some of them
so intensely interested that they could not help prigging choice speci-
mens—we forgive them) Mr. Punch from his lofty height smiled upon
the crowd, and said, in the words of the American beetle that was
pinned to the wall,
“Though I'm stuck up, I am not proud.”
Well, he desired no further recognition than the homage of the
entire world. He had that, and dismissed the subject from his mind.
But, the other day, there comes to him—or rather to his esteemed
publishers, for even with the 1,200,000 soldiers behind it, the Dynasty
would not have dared to profane the name of Punch—a hideous thing
in the semblance of a medal, silver or pewter he did not trouble himself
to ascertain, but assuredly something which no charity boy with a
sense of what was due to the parish would wear on his jacket.
You perceive what Mr. Punch did with the rubbish, and Toby, we
believe, has expended it in cat's meat for the relief of the distressed
cats of Fleet Street. Value such a medal? No, the reverse.
HOW TO CURB A CENTAURESS.
As the season is approaching, and Rotten Rowere long will be as
crowded as Cheapside, it is as well to warn young ladies not to be too
fast, when taking exercise on horseback, lest they haply share the fate
of one who lately had to pay two guineas for her gallop, besides paying
a visit to the Marlborough Street Police Court. This young Centauress
was summoned for furious riding, “going at the rate of sixteen miles
an hour, and whipping her horse constantly,” so the constable alleged.
He also said that “several ladies and gentlemen had complained of her
conduct,” and MR. TYRWHITT, the Magistrate, in fining her, remarked:
“He was sorry to see a young lady in such a predicament, but he did not believe
at the same time that the horse ran away with her as alleged. He believed she had
ridden the horse at a fast rate, which might be amusing to her, but at the same
time was dangerous to others, and she would therefore have to pay a fine of 40s.
and costs.” -
When desiring to perform a rapid act of horsemanship, fast young
ladies should not choose a place like Rotten Row, which never was
intended to be turned into a race-course. For a young lady to make
her début in a Police Court is not a very pleasant predicament to con-
template, but the Row would not be safe for quiet girls to ride in, if
something were not done, as in the case above condensed, to clap a
curb upon the centauresses. Let them amble, trot, or canter in Hyde
Park as they please; but when they want a gallop, while they live in
London, let them be content to take it in a ball-room.

AN ARTICLE IN THEIR OWN STYLE.
..WHAT is the use of the Americans going on bothering and humbug-
ging in this way? Here is their Government at a dead lock, the
PRESIDENT defying Congress, and Congress denouncing the PREsi-
DENT. The latter is made to keep a Minister whom he hates, and he
appeals to the law to turn the man out. Reconstruction fails, and the
negroes are partly inclined to obey their late owners, partly disposed to
seize the United States generally, and make the whites work for them.
And everybody is obliged to toady the Irish, for the sake of votes,
though as soon as the votes are given the Irish will be kicked. The PRE-
sIDENT lays a trap for GRANT, and GRANT snubs the PREsident. Is
this a state of things to go on? Is this a condition into which the descend-
ants of the English should be plunged? Can they not see with their
eyes and understand with their elbows? Clearly, the Americans have
before them a splendid chance of regeneration. Let them have a coup
d'état—they like French words. Abolish the President as a power,
but let him reign, and have responsible Ministers—men responsible to
Parliament (get rid of the ... word Congress), and liable to be turned
out when a majority opposes them. Abolish, also, universal suffrage,
and impose a qualification which shall exclude all rowdies, Irish,
contractors, New York municipals, bully-boys, pugilists, and the
scum generally. Create an Aristocracy—the Americans have the
words “Honourable” and “Reverend” now, and it is childish to be
afraid of “Baronet” and “Lord.” Have a standard of manners and
good breeding. Don't wear black clothes in the morning. In a word,
become a gentlemanly as you are a great nation. We frankly º:
you with this advice in exchange for your lectures on our duty tº
Ireland, and inasmuch as you are at a dead lock, as we have said, and
our institutions are working exceedingly well—a man from the ranks
has just become Premier—we consider that we are doubly entitled to
blow you º for not understanding your own business. Let's liquor
up all round.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCHPS ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, February 24, Great news this week, enormous, gigantic,
colossal. But we must take it in its due place. Mr. Punch, like MR.
DISRAELI, knows how to wait. - - -
My Lords, waking up for the first time since the holidays, plunged
into an Irish debate to-night. LoRD CLANRICARDE moved his Land
Tenure Bill, and drew a pleasing picture of Ireland: rents were paid,
farmers were doing well, and that he thought was wanted was a
law for making written agreements more easy and general. -
It is easy to say Tenant jº but suppose the Tenant can't write?
LoRD Kim BERLEY, Liberal and late lord-Lieutenant, criticised MR.
MILL's proposal that Government should become The Irish Landlord,
saying, that this was to hold out to the tenant that if there were no
Government, there would be no rents to pay, a Fenianite suggestion by
no means desirable. - - - - -
LoRD MALMEsBURY (Lord Privy Seal) said that really his friends
and chiefs had told him nothing, and therefore that was all that he
could tell the House.
The Bill was read a First Time. -
Loºp MALMESBURY repeated that he could not tell the Lords any-
thing, but he moved the Second Reading of the Habeas Corpus, Sus-
pension, saying that the late Government had 360 disaffected folks in
custody, the present one only 95. . . - - -
LoRi, Russell, introduced a fair and ingenious, puff of his new
pamphlet, which he begged their Lordships to consult, if they wanted
to know his views. He adduced the fact that of all emigrants it was
only the Irish who were hostile to their home government, in proof
ſº was something wrong, and the sooner we set matters right
the better.
LoRD HARDwickr wanted to know why LoRD RUSSELI, when in
office, had done nothing towards such settlement, and thought it
unfair in him to scold ot for not doing what he had *...*
LoRD GREY *. that it would take time to secure the regard of
the Irish, but that the first thing to do was to upset the Irish Church.
The Duke of RichMoRD (who is not Premier) said that on the next
night in the Commons, LoRD MAYo, the Irish i. was going to
reveal the plans of the Government, so he, Dux, wo d say nothing
now. This was much neater than LoRD MALMESBURY...
The MARQUIs of WesTMEATH (actat. 83) said something, about, the
desirability of imitating OLIVER CRomwell’s treatment of the Irish.
The EARL OF ELLENBoRough was stern....We owed a debt to the
Irish Protestants who had so long and so faithfully garrisoned Ireland.
He was, however, for religious equality. - -
The Bishop of KILLALOE, as patron of 52 livings, naturally had
something to say in behalf of the Church.
The Bill was read a Second Time.
In the Commons, MR. DUNCAN M'LAREN, M.P. for Edinburgh,
ave notice that the Scotch Reform Bill would not do, and that Scot-
nd must have at least 15 new Members. She won’t.
Session and other courts in Scotland. The Scottish Members wisely
settle these Bills among themselves, whereby the law gets decently
drawn º and trouble is saved to the Imperial Legislature. We, like
the old Scotch woman who heard the great preacher, “wad na hae the
presumption to understand a word o't.”
Tuesday. There was to have been great Irish debate, but Saxon
arrangements thrust themselves in the way.
The EARL OF DERBy resigned :
And the QUEEN desired MR. DISRAELI to form a Government., “If
possible,” said, LoRD MALMESBURY, announcing the facts with his
usual exquisitely felicitous language. Anybody not acquainted with
his Lordship's special grace of speech would have thought that there
was difficulty. Whereas the Great Educator had no trouble at all, and
the old Ministry became the new one, with the exception that we have
a new Premier, a new Chancellor, LoRD CAIRNs (the able-bodied
seaman CHELMsFord not being exactly “pressed” on board the Ben-
jamin Disraeli), and we have the most stalwart Chancellor of Exche-
quer that ever carried a Budget, MR. WARD HUNT.
EARL RUssFIL, of course, paid a †: tribute to the retiring
Premier, and his great qualities, and hoped that the Lords would
again and often hear his noble and eloquent language.
In the Commons the announcement was far more interesting, as it
had to be made by the son of LoRD DERBY. The Foreign Minister
spoke with emotion, and was loudly cheered on all sides. He moved
adjournment. There were shouts for
MR. GLADSTONE, who, in allusion to the special cause, ill-health,
which LoRD STANLEY had, by a singular destiny, to announce as the
reason for his father's retirement, expressed regret that such a career
should be so brought to a close.
MR. MAGUIRE, who had been about to initiate the Irish debate,
hoped for an early day. LORD STANLEY was no less desirous of a full
discussion.
The House adjourned until Friday.
The LoRD Advocate introduced Bills for improving the Court of
Here Mr. Punch º a few precious words of his own. In
one of the most remarkable Cartoons which he has ever presented to a
delighted world, he has recorded the event of the day, the rise of an
un-aided, untitled, and originally unpopular man to the highest place
in the state. The Educator is now formally installed as Head Master,
and as at Eton, he receives a Rod (Blue Ribbon in º time) which,
doubtless, he will be glad to use as little as possible, but which we take
it will not exactly resemble that spoken of by Duke Vincentio:— |
* Fond fathers
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not for use; in time the Rod
Becomes more mocked than feared.”
Mr. Punch has fought with MR. DisrAELI, many an hour by the
Shrewsbury clock, which used to sound the close of the poll for the
honourable gentleman. It is extremely possible that Mr. Punch may
have to fight with him again, many a time, and oft. He is a foeman
worthy of Mr. Punch's steel. Be this as it may, Mr. Punch hereby
presents his best compliments to the Premier of England, and respect:
fully reminds him that in 1848 MR. DisRAELI said in the House, “I
belong to a party that can triumph no more.” The words were half
true. The party to MR. DISRAELI, and the triumph is his.
He

Whether it shall be peace or war between us depends upon the future,

the genius and the perseverance which after thirty years of strife, have
been rewarded with the Premiership.
We shall take no formal leave of Prince Rupert. We share the hope
of EARL Russell that we shall often meet LöRD DERby in the House

LoRD, STANLEY’s notification—did not think that, as a rule, there
should be so much delay, as a few changes of office required but little ;
but as of late, owing to LoRD DERBy’s health, the Cabinet must have
approached the Irish Question, in a crippled and partially restrained
condition, and as there might be more Significance in the change of
Premiership than those outside could be aware of, he would freely and
cheerfully, but on those special grounds, accede to the proposal for
adjournment. But, the business of the Session promised to be rather
| “severe,” and we should be nearly a month behindhand. If any flip-

COURTESY TO COLOURED GENTLEMEN.
A CHANGE has come over the colour of Southern independence never
dreamt about by the insurgent Southerners—a change from white to
black. Not only has black become independent of white, but the
former element in the Southern Conventions preponderates over the
latter, Moreover, it is asserting not merely its independence but
likewise its dignity, insomuch that, according to an American corre-
spondent of the Times:—
“In North Carolina one of the latest achievements of the Convention has been o
expel a newspaper reporter for calling the black members “niggers;' and in
Mississippi a proposition has been made to expel such reporters as do not put “Mr.’
before the names of the dark delegates.”
In thus insisting on ºf named with the title which they consider
due to their consequence, the coloured gentlemen of North Carolina,
however, should remember that there are cases in which its omission
is complimentary. We do not say MR. CAESAR.
Two Good Reasons.
. HARSH comments are made upon the conduct of SIR MoRTON PETo
in retaining his seat for Bristol. He is unkindly accused of doing, so
in deference to a clique that is not yet ready with a candidate. We
believe that this is not the case, and that SLR MoRTON PETo merely
desires to take part in the coming debates on “Charities” and on the
Bankruptcy Law.

Rise in the Clubs, and saunter to the House,
In-looking on the happy Hugh, LQRD CAIRNs,
And thinking of the Bills that are in store.
Sure as the hammer falling at a sale,

Sad as the feeling when our bargains prove
Not quite the treasures which we hoped to find ;
So sad, so sure, the Bills that are to bore.
Ah, sad (not strange) as on dark winter morns

THE BRITISH LION AT THE HOME OFFICE.
It is doubtful if more of the naked truth was ever exposed in a
Minister's Room than by one MR. SMITH, “of Rotherhithe,” at
MR. HARDy's reception of the Deputation from the National Con-
servative Union last week. Our good friend the Pall Mall Gazette,
which has a sharp eye for the plums in the gathering of the day, prints
a verbatim report of this harangue of the illustrious SMITH-who
assumes the proud title of “part-proprietor of the British Lion.”
And who, let us ask, if we may judge by the Post-office Directory,
can set up a better title to that designation than SMITH-John
SMITH, no doubt—at once eponym and representative of the gens
SMITH, which counts more heads than any gens in the nation—BRowN,
Joses, and RoBINsoN not excepted. And thus he roared, at the Home
Office, in the manner characteristic of the animal, with one eye to his
principles, and the other to his profits:–
“The stronghold of Radicalism has been the weekly cheap press, but we, Sir,
have established the British Lion, which circulates in thousands, and I call on you,
Sir, and all present, to support it in a business way by giving it advertisements.
In the British Lion, Sir, we have given the Liberals what they will not forget.
They have libelled us in every way, and called us everything, even walrusses:
They have even gone so far as to say that no one could know whether we had a head or
a tail. What are those people to whom we are opposed? Are they the people
who figured in last Saturday's paper as persecuting the press? Are they not the
people who get up an agitation like wildfire * I have been used to work all my life,
and I can te º: I don't want no mercenary agitators. What we want you, the
Conservative Ministry—you whom we have the highest respect for and confidence
in—to do is, to associate with us, to come a little more amongst us. You did not
come to the Crystal Palace. But, certainly, Lond John MANNERs did come. Well,
Sir, I wish to present you with this paper (British Lion) to peruse over. I wrote to
the CHANCELLOR of the Exchequr R about this “ British Lion,' but I did not receive a
reply, and I also wrote to Lord DERBY for support, but I did not get any. [A very
cruel hit this...] It is a penny paper, Sir–it is a new Paper, Sir—and is doing an
immense amount of good. If there are any Conservative gentlemen here who have
advertisements to give away, let them not mind sending them to the daily papers,
but to us; because I may tell you, Sir, that I'm a part proprietor of the British Lion,
and of course I wish to do my property service. In conclusion, Sir, I have very
great pleasure in meeting Mk. HARDY, that great hero of the metropolis."
Well roared, British Lion] ... The conclusion of the Gazette's re-
port, is startling. “MR. HARDY,” it says, “bowed, and put the
British Lion in his 'et.”
Let us hope no British HomeSecretary ever did that. MR. WALRole
once put the British Lion, if not in his pocket, in his pocket-handker-
chief, when he wept in the bosom of BEALEs, but we had trusted that
MR. Hºnor, as his name implies, was made of sterner stuff. Perhaps,
however, if he did put the British Lion in his pocket, it was only to have
him ready to slip at any noisy mob who may hereafter venture to
invade the Home Office, be it FINLAN and his Fenians, or even BEALEs
and his Bubbleyjocks.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW NOVEL COMPANY.
THE first novel by the Sensational Novel Company (Limited) con-
sisting of-
The Authors of Never Too Late for the Colleen Pogue, Dora's Wampire,
Who’s Griffiths (Gaunt) & Hard Streets of London Assurance,
Peg Woffington's Strike, The Double Carriage, Hunted Up.
Also of the Authors of The Woman with No Name, The Thoroughfare
without a Heart, The 'Idden 'And.
Also of the Authors of Les Mystères de Château Boum, Mokeanna, or
The White Witness, Jasper's Money, The Grandmother's Wengeance,
Disorderly's Secret, Romula and Rema, The White Ram, The
Mabel False, Spiritual Columbines, Nobody's Nephew.
THE EDITOR'S PREFACE.
In order to present the public with a work of fiction which shall be
unequalled by any similar production of the present day, the Editor
has ordered a novel from the above recently-established Sensational
Novel Company (Limited) consisting of various distinguished authors
whose works are mentioned above, and whose names it would there-
fore be unnecessary, may superfluous, to give. -
The Editor’s object has been to obtain the most startling, most
thrilling, most exciting plot constructed by the most original romancers,
whether from their own or foreign brains it, matters not, now in this
country; situations contrived by experienced dramatists, sharp, crisp
dialogue by the ablest novelists and dramatic writers, and descriptions,
where requisite, by several distinguished gentlemen whose speciality
lies in this groove. . -
The reader’s time will not be wasted on pages of analysis of character,
descriptive touches about sunsets, sunrises, trees and the appearance
of nature generally under various aspects, which only impede the clear
course of the story and tire the patience of the purchaser.
As each Author engaged upon this tale has been constantly employed
(according to the rules of the Company) in revising his collaborators’
work, the desired end has been obtained, and with few exceptions
[where the Editor has at the last moment restored passages or inter-
polated necessary explanations] the story never flags either in action
or in dialogue. - . .
That is, as far as the Editor has read at present, for the entire novel is
not º in his hands. - - - -
The illustrations are, or rather will be, by several artists of un-
doubted reputation, whom it would occupy too much space here to
name, and whose particular praises it would be to a degree, invidious
to *; They are, the Editor is most happy to say, on excellent terms
with the Authors of this novel, and therefore he confidently expects
the happiest results from such a combination of Genius and Talent.
To his dear friends, the Authors, the Editor turns and begs them to
remember the old fable of the bundle of sticks, a suggestion he
would not dare to make to a Company of Āctors—but to the Literary
Limited Company the case is happily far different. Bear with each
other's faults of style, and continue to aim at producing by your united
efforts One such work as shall establish #. new speculation on a
secure basis, and shall mark an era in the Literature of our Great and
Glorious Country. Now, to the public | *
• ADDENDUM.
On consideration, the Editor deems it as well to state, at the outset
of this new undertaking, two conditions for which the Éirectors of the
Co., for themselves, and the Authors, for themselves, have stipulated as
a sine gud non of publication in this journal:—
First. That the Directors shall have full liberty, from time to time,
to publish with the story such notes as they may deem necessary for
the clear explanation of the novel, the benefit of the public at large,
and their own protection as Directors of the aforesaid Company.
Secondly. That the Authors shall have full liberty to publish, from
time to time with the Story, individually or conjointly, the one with
the other, such notes as they together, or each severally, shall deem
necessary for the furtherance of the plot, their own reputations indi-
º or collectively, and the general advantage of the public at
e.
*...* The Editor having as cheerfully as possible consented to the
above º now trusts to the good faith, kindly joriearance,
and gentlemanly feeling of all concerned in this present Novel, not to
abuse the concession thus made, and finally throws himself upon the
kindness of a generous and indulgent public.
* This finishing sentence was unluckily in print, and escaped the Editor's wary
eye. It means “now I place this novel in the hands of the public, who will pro- |
nounce upon its merits.” As it stands it does appear as if the Editor, fatigued by the
excessive exertions of Preface-writing, had thrown down the pen and thirsting
for refreshment, had exclaimed, “Now to the Public : " an erroneous impression
which he hastens to remove. As MR. Dowie:R said, “Those who know me best,
best know me,” or words to that effect.—ED.
A few Words as to the Title of the New Novel, “CHIKKIN HAZARD.”
The Authors jointly and severally protest i. this title, which has
been selected #. the Editor—[also jointly and severally against all the
titles proposed by one another]—as however no, better one could be
agreed upon, this was at a recent meeting of the Company adopted
under protest:—
They wish it to be distinctly understood that CHIKKIN HAZARD
(spelt thus also under protest) was not, nor is, nor ever has been, sug-
gested by the highly successful novel now º: in weekly parts,
entitled Fowl Play, nor any part or parts of it, nor do they (the Authors)
think that as far as they’ve gone the name CHIKKIN ARD has very
much to do with the Story.
Note by the Directors of the New Co .—The Directors beg to
state that they have the greatest confidence in the Editor's discretion,
and in justice to him, themselves and Company, they now place
before the public the titles originally suggested by the various Authors
engaged upon this work:—
. The Fiend's Followers.
. The Clergyman's Grandmother.
. Gentle Maud: a Tale of Saxony.
. Happy Days in Langouste: a łowiadour. Story.
sº Sam : or, The Rollicking Recollections of Toothless
ommy.
. The Better Land: a Series for Children.
. Dan, or the Murderers of the Mhoilijm.
... My First ſoil.
. Golly Boy. A Tale of the Early Christians.
. Boar Hunting in Australia.
. Glen M'Kroskie, or the Last of the Highland Chiefs.
- Wº there’s a Will there’s a Way, or how to Cure Smoky
... Uhlmneys.
. Sir Martin Nickleby, or Dombey and Twist: a Romance of the
Thirteenth Century.
14. Hocus; or, The Dark Horse. A Confession of Turf Rascality.
The fifteenth was Magnolia, or the Captive Turk: a Poem in Seven
Books; and was immediately protested against by every one concerned
in the success of the work. Its proposer was unable to see that his
idea scarcely fitted in with the scheme of a sensational novel, and he at
first resigned his seat at the Company's board, but an arrangement
having been entered into that he should provide whatever poetry might
be wanted (three pieces at least being stipulated for) in the course of
§: story, our kind and amiable friend resumed his functions in the
Ompany.
.
CHAPTER I.
(Will appear in our next.)]
FOXHUNTINGIN FRANCE.
. It is with pardonable pride that we reflect upon the fact that our
lively friends the French are yearly learning more and more to imitate
the English. Roast beef with them is now an extremely common dish,
although they have not yet acquired our taste for eating it with horse-
radish. Plumpouding a l’Anglaise they also vastly relish, though their
cooks have not yet learned the art of making it correctly. Beer is now
the favourite º: on the boulevards, and French swells are 'seen
parading with a big stick and a boule-dog. The athletic game of domi-
noes, is going out of fashion, and young athletes pant for glory, in
le noble jeu de cricket. Rowing clubs, too, flourish, and have capital
regates, and the science of la bore is now so popular in Paris that
!. will, ere long, be decided with the fists, instead of swords or
pistols.
So we can hardly be surprised when a newspaper informs us that—
“The novel entertainment of fox-hunting in the Bois de Boulogne is promised
this season.”
Fox-hunting in France How the ghost of poor Tom Moody would
stare at such a notion! How he would have roared at Mounseer
j. going fox-hunting! Conceive his burst of laughter at the
marvellous costume which would adorn the gallant sportsman. Fancy
his delight at hearing “Yoicks!” or “Tallyho!” or their nearest
French equivalents, shouted by a Frenchman.
But we are fast outgrowing our old insular ideas of British universal
world-superiority. Why should not Frenchmen hunt, and hunt as well
as Englishmen? Perhaps the Bois de Boulogne is hardly fitted for
the sport, any more than would Hyde Park be, for men who like big
º: and are straight goers across country. But let the sport be set
on foot, and better meets will be suggested, and French journals, like
our own, will soon be full of hunting fixtures. We love to see good
sport, and would everywhere encourage it, believing that it leads to
health and happiness in life, if enjoyed in moderation. Fox-hunting is
certainly a far more manly pastime than lounging in a café, ſplaying
dominoes or billiards.

“A shrewd and witty lady used to tell me that

the date was a long time ago."
LADY MoRGAN was shrewd, but did she

º Sir, mad as a March hare... What! why, his brother was the
great African traveller. All mad, Sir; all African travellers, LIVING-

eat their sick relations—mad, Sir, mad! Uncontrollable impulse to
wander about—monomania. Outbreak of travelling craze—disap-
pearance. Accounted for at once. §uppressed madness, all of a sudden
º: That’s all, Sir, that’s all.’ - "..
“There seems to be a great deal in what you say, Sir,” I replied to
old MR. JBRUFF. It certainly is difficult to imagine what but mad-
ness could induce anybody to go *:::: about, as you say, amon
lions and cannibals. But we might think the same of gentlemen o
wealth who choose to put themselves in the way of cannon-balls.”
“So I do, Sir. Only, so long as we want an army, we mustn't say
so.”
“Well, Sir, I only so far venture to differ from you as not to call
our famous travellers and explorers all absolutely mad. But, doubt-
less, your Mungo Parks, your Belzonis, your. Burtons, your Bekes,
and your Spekes, are actuated by a peculiar ſimpulse to travel. It
looks like the operation of a particular faculty—a special genius.”
: Inordinate passion, Sir ; enthusiasm—insanity.”
“When excessive and outrageous, yes. , Qtherwise, like a peculiar
turn for music—or ciphering. Now, certainly it does not follow that
because a man likes butter, therefore his brother must like butter.
Still, brothers very often have similar tastes. Phrenology—”
: Phrenology is all humbug, Sir.”
“Possibly not quite all. Your brains, Sir, pººr. are not mere
stuffing, they may have functions above those of so much fat... Now,
Phrenology, Sir, says, that there is a certain organ of “Locality, of
which large size and great activity occasion ardent love of travelling.
Suppose two brothers have it, both of them, large. In the case of one
it finds relief in exertion, has no play in that of the latter. At last its
pent-up energy explodes in temporary aberration. Of course, Sir, this
is a mere hypothesis, but isn't it as good, a one as the less charitable
§. on which journalists have been using strong language,
talking about suicide of reputation and so on "
“Well, Sir, perhaps so. But mind, I don't give in to Phrenology;
I can't, I won't, I never will; nor to Mesmerism neither, nor
Popery. -
#. Profundity, Mr. Punch, will discern that my suggestion of a
mind unbalanced by a seizure with over-excitement of the desire to
travel, may be true independently of Phrenology, 1 propose it, not of
course, as any possibly new idea to your masculine readers, but in the
hope that the numerous young ladies who study your columns may
perhaps derive some recreation from considering a little question of
mental philosophy and pathology. Wherewith I rest, yours truly,

FANCIFUL, BUT FISHY.
FANcy Balls have recently been plentiful in Paris, and we can fancy
from what follows that these Fancy Balls have brought forth some
fanciful costumes:–
“Among the novel toilette effects, people speak of an aquarium, showing the
waist enclosed with beautiful shells, the continuation being a short jupe of sea-green
‘....” which are to be found numerous samples of the animal and vegetable

hat a queer quadrille it would be where two such partners were seen
dancing with a farmyard and a stable, which, considered as costumes,
would be hardly more preposterous. With regard to the aquarium, we
think a wreath of sea anemones entwined round her back-hair would
have been prettily appropriate. A nice bouquet of sea-weeds would
also have been suitable, and when going to the ball she might have
been most fitly wrapped up in a seal-skin. The shells worn round her
waist must have been troublesome to a partner, if they were either
sharp or prickly. Fancy what a state his right-hand glove would get
into, after clasping in a waltz a waist girt about with razor-shells, Or,
still worse, with prickly cockles! Moreover, we object to the “samples
of the animal world,” as being wholly out of place upon a sea-green
petticoat. If it ever be our fortune to dance with an aquarium, we
should much prefer her wearing a score or two of nice fresh, juicy
oysters on her jupe, which we could open at our leisure, and eat after

NARCISSE.
“Narcissumque vocat. De quo consultus, an esset
Tempora maturae visurus longa senectae:
Fatidicus vates, ‘Si se non viderit,' inquit.
Kºśl."
Resque probat, letique genus, Ovid, Met. III. 346.
MR. PUNCH is glad to hold out the right hand of fellowship to a
foreign actor, HERR BANDMANN, who has lately made a very successful
appearance among us in a favourite German part called Narcisse. This
gentleman brings to our stage a bilingual reputation-German and
American. He can hardly speak German more fluently and correctly
than, on the whole—and bating an Americanism or two-he speaks
English. The American stage, like most American arts and institu-
tions, is, as yet, little more than a copy of the English, stage, with its
worst points, such as excess, trust in clap-trap, and lack of refinement,
more prominent; and the Transatlantic brand—as we have learnt
from too many imported samples of United States stage-wares labelled
“first-class American,” but which, on trial, have turned out Brumma-
m on this side of the water—is anything but a guarantee of quality.
xceptions, like JEFFERson, only prºve the rule. - -
But the German stage is quite unlike our own. The direct influence
of such men as GoFTHE, ScHILLER, and LEssDNG, and, in a lower
range, IMMERMANN; LAUBE, and other literary stage directors, and the
connection of the theatre with the Court in the small German states,
have both tended to give an intellectual character to German actors
and audiences, which, if occasi leading to dulness and artificiality
in the players, and to tolerance of long-winded plays and stilted per-
formances in the people, has yet produced a sense of respect for art
and brains in both, the want of which is the chief cause of the coarse-
ness of most English acting, and the relish of the British
public for coarse sensations and sources of effect, and insensibility to
refined ones. - - -
In MR. BANDMANN’s acting, the idealising and artificial style of the
German stage has been dashed, but not destroyed, tempered, but not
trampled out, by the influences of his American experience. He has
learned to depend on nature, without jº the measure and
means of Art, to keep his fervour on this side of rant, and to sustain
his pathos above the region of whine and namby-pamby. His art has
just that ideal and poetic, quality which is so rare on our stage just
now, that it may practically be treated as altogether wanting. . . He
has, especially, two gifts which are indispensable to a poetic actor–
fervour of passion, and grace of movement. Realism, the supremacy of
“coat and waistcoat” plays, the reign of sensation and prose, instead
of idealism and blank verse, and the study of the models furnished by
a time of restrained: emotion, and slovenly manners, have gone far to
destroy these among English actors. It is well that we should be
recalled to their charm and value. MR. FECHTER did much in this
way, MR. BANDMANN continues, and, unless we are mistaken, betters
the instruction.
But the play and the part he has chosen for his début are not what
they ought to be. HERR BRACHyogºl's Five Act Tragedy, translated
literally, would be utterly, intolerable to a British public, from its
tediousness and stiltedness together. Even as condensed (to little over
two hours) and enlivened in the adaptation played at the Lyceum, it
is, too often, heavy and dull. Nor is the part of Narcisse, though it gives
the actor some effective openings, .# better than the play.
We have heard Germans call him “a nineteenth century Hamlet.” We
can only say as German a Hamlet, as Klopstock is a MILTON.
But the merits of the actor are distinct from those of the part. As
to the former, we recommend playgoers to judge for themselves. As
to the latter, we recommend HERE BANIMANN to study the Sors
Ovidiana which we have prefixed to this notice. -
If he wishes to maintain and enhance his success, don't let him fall
in love with himself in Narcisse, but turn from that unhealthy and
stagey part to something manlier and nobler–Hamlet, Othello, Shylock.
There is SHAKSPEARE crying, “ Come act me!”
Don’t let him think, because MR. FECHTER was faithless enough to
throw over SHAKspeARE for sensation, and to prefer the fustian of
French melodrama to the fire and force of English tragedy, that there
is not room and verge enough for a great actor among the high places
of the poetic drama. He will find plenty to preach that doctrine to
him. t him turn a deaf ear to these evil counsellors, and take for
his motto, the American poet's device, “Excelsior l’”

A FENIAN ON HIS FRIENDS.
TUNE-Itinerary Ballad.
O PITY a Fenian prisoner,
Awaiting of his doom,
For treason and for murder too,
All in a prison's gloom.
My native soil was Ireland,
#. Island of the Free,
But I scorned to live the Saxon's thrall
In chains and slavery.
In proud disdain to be a slave,
I emigrated o'er the wave.
A citizen of the United States
In due time I became,
And there fought in the ranks of death
On the glorious field of fame.
But when the war was ended,
And Peace prevailed once more,
Ijoined the Fenian Brotherhood,
And returned to my native shore.
We thought to lay the tyrants low,
The time was come to strike the blow.
But, what made us especially
The British Lion dare,
Was the friends of the bold Jamaica blacks,
And the foes of Governor EYBE.
The more because among that crew
The ers, name by name,
That took our part in Parliament,
Were all of them the same.
They weren't kicked out; which when we saw,
It encouraged us to defy the law.
Policemen we did shoot and kill,
For which occasion some,
All in the town of Manchester,
Did suffer martyrdom.
In Clerkenwell we did blow down
The prison wall, and blew
Up working men and women,
And many children too.

MR. PUNCH takes off his hat to M. º: gushes with con-
gratulation on the fact that some fresh laurels have been added to his
grown, . To have written a new opera at the age of nearly ninety, is a
feat which no composer, excepting M. AUBER, has ever yet achieved.
Moreover, the new opera has gained a marked success, and has most
thoroughly deserved the applause it has excited, if Mr. Punch may
credit the critical reports, and § §: too, by the ºf and
the whistling of its music, wherewith he has been favoured by obliging
connoisseurs. Not having time himself to go to Paris just at present—
for what would Parliament become, without his weekly Essence f—
Mr. Punch must wait a month or two ere hearing the new opera, which
he hopes to do in London before the season ends. Then as Agamem-
non, being, like him, “King of Men,” Mr. Punch will shake the earth
in applauding Monsieur Nestor, who is also Monsieur Orpheus. Mean-
while, Mr. Punch has consoled himself a little § a visit to the pretty
little new Saint George's Qpera-House, where he heard MADEMoisBLLE

ears full of the charming melodies of AUBER, he plodded his way home-

By the bye, Mr. Punch, in a recent article, did an injustice to his old
friend, MR. WEBSTE of the Adelphi. Mr. Punch objected to º:
a fee for “booking,” and avowed “that any Manager who wo
abolish this grievance might make a swift and substantial fortune.”
Now Ms. Wººstºn is a Manager who deserves that his pieces should
have an Arabian Entertainments' run, and be the talk, and the sight,

NDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR THE LO
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
N Thursday, March 5th, 1868, BEN-
JAMIN DisrAELI entered the House
of Commons, amid cheering, PREMIER
of England.
There was not much to be said, no
F. complications having cause
he change in the Ministry—so far as
the public yet knows. It is motorious
that LoRD DERBY's health made it
necessary for him to retire. Whether
MR. DisrAELI designed the shaping
any august decree which seemed too
august for the Earl, may hereafter
appear. The new PREMIER had
simply to bear a fitting tribute to the
industry of the late PREMIER, and to
refer to his brilliant perception and
fiery eloquence. As regarded MR.
Dish AELI's accession to office, he
knew that in his position there were
personal and peculiar reasons which
would aggravate the burden and aug-
ment the difficulties. People can in-
terpret these words as they please.
Those who give them a significance
- - connected with birth, and who have
intelligence enough to take a large view of pedigree, may note
that they were uttered by a man descended from one of the
Hebrew families expelled from Spain by the Inquisition, and who
settled in Venice as merchants. The PREMIER’s grandfather, who was
therefore Italian, came to England, and his son, Isa Ag DisBAELI, a
retired gentleman of Buckinghamshire, was the author of the series of
subtle literary and historical researches, of which the Curiosities is best
known, but all of which are delightful to scholarly minds. LoRD
Lytton, observes in a note to one of his earlier works, that when he
was contesting an election, somebody took an objection to him as a
new man, “Well, if pedigree be of any consequence in politics, MR:
BULWER's flºg is about three times as old as that of his opponent.”
“Is it possible, Sir?—it can't be—MR. BULweR is an author.” Add
§: Bunsby's formula, and we have done with that part of the
usiness.
. MR. DisBAELI stated that he had enjoyed twenty years of confiden-
tial co-operation with LoRD DERRY, and had succeeded to his policy.
Our Foreign Policy is to be that of Peace, not of selfish isolation,
*: of sympathy both with the prosperities and the troubles of other
Ilations.
Our Domestic Policy is to be Liberal—a truly liberal policy. We
are not to shrink from requisite changes, but we are not to forget that
we dwell in an ancient and historic country, rich in the traditions that
are the best security for order and liberty.
Ireland, a most interesting and important portion of the kingdom
has still to be protected, by the Suspension, against an unprinciple
foreign confederation, But he believed that agitations were dis.
appearing. He would not fritter away the interest felt, in regard to
the intentions of Government as to Ireland, as they would be explained
by LoRD, MAYo, in the coming Irish debate. . He added, that some
time had been lost this Session, but he should work as hard as he
could, and should also do all he could to facilitate the promotion of
measures on the other side.
Amid the cheers which followed, up bounded the bouncing
Bouvekre,
What do you mean by a policy? Last year's, or the year before last?
Are you educating your party, or is its education complete f You are
fairly entitled to your own position. But you have no majority. In
Lºad Dººby the key-stone of your arch is gone. It is the fault of the
Liberals that you are in power. The Liberals are little better than a
Rabble, with a great man in front. Last year you yielded to mob dic-
tation. You were afraid to hang the Irish rebels. All this is uncon-
stitutional... You will come to grief. You ought, to have made a
Coalition Ministry out of the best materials. Can't we unite on any:
thing Are we to fight over the Irish Church? Are we not agreed
about land, all of us except MR. MILL, who would atone for three con:
fiscations by a fourth?_Public interests are suffering by the neglect of
necessary measures. There !
SIR. GeoRGE Bowyer thought that really this was not the way to
behave to a new Minister. As to a rabble, the time, had passed for
blind following of leadership. If Government did its duty, it would be
º: regardless of majorities.
here ended the opening chapter in the history of the Disraeli
*
Ministry., .
Before leading our readers to the foot of the gallows, it may be con-
venient to take them into the House of Peers.
§ genius, energy, and (young people) |had
The EARL or MALMEsBURY, who is to be—don't laugh—the leader
in the Peers, began by explaining that he had been inaccurately
reported as having said that MR, DisrAELI was to make a Ministry
“if possible.” hat he had said was, “as soon as possible.” The
Earl is a gentleman, and the explanation, was enough. But he must
add that it was “a very natural mistake.” Did, he mean that it was
natural for people to believe that he was likely to think that Tory
Peers would not fall into their ranks under MR. DISRAELI's leader-
ship P The rest of his speech was formal, but he promised an early
Education Bill. -
EARL Russell could not help saying that he had no confidence in a
Government that openly professed to say, one thing and mean another.
He used the word deception, and contended that he might have used a
different word. -
The Duke of MARLBoRough had not the least idea what the noble
Earl could mean. - -
EARL Russell would tell him, then. Would he read his Chief's
Edinburgh Speech about educating his party, to, consent to what he
been for years calling a degradation of the Franchise. Fox
GREY, Althorp, would have scorned such a course, and so would
Pº Live RPool, and WELLINGTON.
“The subject then dropped.” -
The last word naturally suggests a *k. another kind. In the
Commons, MR. HARDY moved the Second Reading of the Bill enacting
Private Executions. -
SERJeANT GAselee said that it was a poor man's question, and that
if a poor man were to be hanged, he had a right to be hanged in
public. He moved the rejection of the Bill. -
SIR. GeoRGE Bowy ER seconded this, thinking that the sight of an
execution was very deterrent from crime.
MR. GILPIN opposed the Bill, and quoted MR. CoBDEN, who was
said to have likened the proposed practice to private assassination.
After a short debate,
MR. M'CLAREN (Edinburgh) supported the Bill, and begged that
Scotchmen might share with Englishmen the advantage of being
privately hanged. - -
The LoRD Advocate promised this boon, and on division, the
Second Reading was carried by 181 to 25. -
The PREMIER moved the Second Reading of the Election Bribery
Bill, which had been so unfavourably received. , He, now proposes
that two real judges, Judges of the Land, shall be detached, as it were,
from the main body of the army of justice, and sent, on full salaries, to
the places, accused, of corruption. Of course, new Judges will be
appointed in their place.
MR. GLADSTONE, thought this a very great improvement, and would
not oppose the Second #. reserving his right of consideration.
LoRD LoBNE took his seat for Argyllshire. We mention this to
flash off a quotation from WALTER Scott. MR. BRUCE was already
in the House. Suppose they debated education:-
“Short were their shrift in that Debate,
That hour of fury and of fate,
Had Lohne encountered BRUCE."
Friday. The son of the inventor of that delightful article, the Shrap-
nell shell, petitioned the Lords for a national reward. Government
replied that the shell was valuable, but as the inventor had £1200
a year for 28 years, and £10,000 from the East India Company, there
would be no more shelling out.
In the Commons there was a very good debate on the Alabama busi-
ness. MR. SHAw LEFevre gave an elaborate history of the case, and
LoRD STANLEY replied in his best manner. MR. ForstER and Mr.
MILL spoke, and so did MR. GLADstone, who said that he did not
wonder that the Americans thought themselves wronged, but that if
We º before the Arbitrator, we ought to be prepared to contend that
we had done no wrong, but that whatever miscarriage might have
occurred was accidental. This delivery of MR. GLADston E's is carped
at by those who want us to humble ourselves before the North, because
it has been successful; but MR. GLADston E represents the feeling of
the nation. We are sorry to have wounded the Americans, and they
know it; but, we having said that, and being ready to pay for broken
windows, the matter should be closed. It is satisfactory to be told by
LoRD STANLEY that good-feeling towards us is increasing in America,
and that MR. SEwARD inclines to a new mode by which our differences
may be adjusted. -
A small wrangle as to the day on which the Irish Reform Bill should
be introduced. The PREMIER said that it was for him to fix the order
of business, and MR. GLADsTone said that the Irish Reform . Bill was
part of the Government scheme for Ireland, and ought to be forth-
coming at once. But MR. DISRAELI would not give way.
A GRAND INVENTION.

The Poor Law Board is obliged to admit that DR.

THE WAY NOT TO WIN WESLEYANS.
THE enemies of the Church of England must be sorry that Convoca-
tion stands º for two months. They may, however, console
themselves with the hope that it will be permitted to assemble after
Easter, and will then go on as it has hitherto been going, in a way cal-
culated, as though on purpose, to bring the whole institution of which
it comprises the º officers, into contempt. Should it turn over
a new leaf, make a fresh start, and go on for the future injust an oppo-
site way, then, indeed, there may be some chance that brave Bishop
SELwys (of Lichfield, and, pending a successor's appointment, of New
d) may, should he live a hundred łº or so longer—as let us
hope, he will-see, towards the end of his labours, fulfilled the hope
which, at a missionary meeting in the Guildhall of Cambridge the other
day, he thus expressed:—
“He hoped that tfe day would come, and that soon, when all those faithful
disciples of Joan Wesley, who are now doing a good missionary work abroad, would
unite and be one with the Church in those efforts. The missionary of New Zealand
would be greatly benefited if the missionary efforts of the Wesleyans could be
combined with those of the Church of England. Christians should so unite to
evangelise the world."
. But if Bishop Selwyn's colleagues in Convocation continue to dis-
†: themselves by such feats as ºf themselves unable to
deal with the Ritualists while the question of their legal ability, or
inability is yet under trial; if one of them, may still avow Ritualist
doctrines without getting himself disavowed as well as ColeNso; and
if the whole lot will permit themselves to entertain such a question as
that of “reserving” the viațicum, the faithful disciples of John WESLEY
will most assuredly intrench themselves more strongly than ever in the
Wesleyan Meeting-house, at the greatest moral and spiritual distance
possible from a Church by that measurement apparently next door
to the Roman Catholic Chapel. As long as this is the sort of business
transacted by Convocation, the Wesleyan Conference will mind its
own, and Bishop SELwyN may employ spare time in whistling for the
Methodists, uninvited with the song “0 whistle, and I’ll come to ye,
my lad,” by any one member of that Protestant body.
A NEW MUSICAL CONDUCTOR.
IN PROFEssor TYNDAL's interesting Lectures upon Sound, we find
the following put forth among his other sound opinions:–
“It would be possible to lay on, by means of wooden conductors, the music of a
band to a distance in all directions, much as we lay on water."
While clever MR. MANNs conducts the Crystal Palace orchestra,
nobody with any truth can venture to assert it has a “wooden con-
ductor.” But how pleasant it would be to hear the charming con:
certs there, without the bore of going to them | Fancy “laying on”
a symphony to one's smoking-room or snuggery, and revelling in
Beethoven while relishing one's tobaccol. Perhaps in a few seasons
subscribers to the Palace may enjoy this in addition to its manifold
attractions. Ears made of india-rubber have been in fashion lately,
and we often wish our ears were equally elastic. If they were so, we
might stretch them on a Saturday to Sydenham, and hear MozART and
MENDELssohn without a railway journey. However, if these wooden
conductors be adopted, our ears will need no straining to catch the
Crystal music. But surely great care must be taken in laying down
the sound-tubes, so that no unpleasant noises may chance to be con-
veyed by them. How horrid it would be if one's conductor, while
conveying some sweet music to one's ear, were suddenly to vibrate
with the whistle of a steam-engine! And conceive the aural torture,
when one's ears are full of BEETHoven, of hearing a few squeals
somehow intruded by a barrel-organ!
More for Selwyn.
New Zealand and Lichfield,
And he prefers Which field?
He'll go to New Zealand, he’ll on his old sec land ;
Returned again, Lichfield will be his new Zeal land.

“Why? haſ hal” laughed the elder grimly, and both his eyes
shooting forth a murderous he rose from his seat, and waved a keen-
edged hatchet above his head. JoB turned deadly pale. He could
scarcely raise his glass to his lips as he said with a sickly smile,
“Always the same light-hearted creature, father.” -
Once, twice the fearful weapon flashed through the air, and then
descended upon—

OHAPTER II.
Not on the prostrate form of Job FRIESTLoR fell the cold steel.
For, the form of Job FRIESTLoR was not prostrate. -
But, as MICHAEL bent forward, the younger and more active man
sprang upon his back, and by a trick, which, he had learnt from the
utlandshire Wrestlers, staved in his father's head between his
shoulders. - - -
Had Michael been in good training, his muscles hard and taut
would not have yielded to this sudden pressure, and his brave old
heart would have snapped altogether, nigh broken as it was even now
by his son's thoughtless and unfeeling conduct. But his muscles were
lax, and gave to the force thus exerted so easily as to cause the old
man a sensation of extreme pleasure, as of drowning, especially when
his head rose once more to the surface.
The second which this had occupied seemed years to Migh AEL, who
in that dark moment had seen all his young life brought before him,
had seen his parents imploring mercy at his hands, his brothers at his
feet, his sisters starving under his roof, his aunts and uncles chained
to the damp walls, the flames, bursting from the convent, the ship
scuttled, the Derby favourite hocussed, the bridegroom poisoned, the
butler (who was supposed to have stolen it) exiled, the Sepoy's cruel
sword descending on her fair young neck, the fierce animal rushing on
him with whetted tusks, SIR JASPER's white hair streaming in the
wind, the calm martyr refusing the Emperor's last offer of life, and he
raised his hands to shut out these fearful sights.t
A roaring sound as of lions raving and tearing into the cave.

“I shall take it in through the pores,” observed Michael,in whom
the instinct of self preservation was stronger than the greed of gain.
The aperture through which the sea flowed in was scarcely big
enough for a man's body.
The idea struck them both: at once. Whose Bopy?
“Father,” cried Job, kneeling down, “Your forgiveness; ” and he
clung to his parent's knees, frantically.
“Job!” exclaimed the aged fisherman, “Rise, I entreat, I com—”
Louder and fiercer comes the remorseless tide. -
Seizing his knees, and head for the second time, JoB compressed his
father into the smallest possible compass, and inserted him backwards
into the entrance of the cave.
The wind might beat, the waves roar and surge against that old man,
but his ear was for ever deaf to the voice of his favourite child, who
now knelt before him to implore his last blessing. There he sat, fixed,
taking it in, as he had said, through the pores. - -

was gradually melting. To remove his father and admit the air, was
to let in the water. -
The sun acting externally upon the surface had rotted the cliff
above ; it wanted but the exclusion of the air underneath to set the
crumbling mass in one steady blaze.
He was alone! It was a maddening thought.
ALONE!
Was there no hope P
No chance of escape P
Yes—one.
ONE | | |
For through a fissure in the lurid rock above he now distinctly saw,
as it were, a gigantic iron hand swinging forwards and backwards, as
if in search of prey. -
t came nearer, nearer, lower, lower, within his reach. Leaping
upwards, h

CHAPTER III.
LEAPING upwards, he clutched The Iron Hand.
A Grapnel, a huge grapnel !
Retaining a firm hold upon his preserver, JoB looked towards the
*} gratefully.
t was a balloon streaming calmly away towards the horizon.
To climb into the car and throw out its two occupants, who were at
the moment engaged upon scientific computations, was to Job FRIEST-
LOR, the work of a second.
“My poor father l’ sighed the young man, for now that the first
excitement was over, he had time to give a thought to others. The
old man had been so proud of him. He had often prophesied his rise
in the world. “And here I am,” said Job to himself, smiling sadly.
Still his situation was too critical for him to indulge in any maudlin
sentimentality.
“What have we here!” he exclaimed, kicking his foot against a box
biº at the bottom of the car.
The car was filled with chests of gold, bullion, and silver coins.
Besides these, there were tin boxes labelled with names and initials
containing title deeds, policies, wills, shares in various companies, and
ank cheques with signatures attached.
The balloon had evidently belonged to two Fraudulent Solicitors,
who were escaping from justice.
They had met, as we have seen, with a fate richly merited. We
shall hear of them no more.”
Night came on. He was alone floating over the silent ocean.
“Where am I?’” was his first thought P
He knew the Great Bear by sight, and this knowledge he felt would
now be of infinite service to him if he could only see that constellation.
At last. The Great Bear.
He recollected how he had heard of mariners before the invention of
rudders, guiding themselves entirely by the Great Bear, and he won-
dered how they had done it.
tº: he burst into a loud chant, waking the sea-birds on the ocean's
som.
Twinkle, twinkle,
Little star !
How I wonder,
What you are l
Then the words, seemed to fly from him, and others came into his
mouth, and he made wild rhymes, singing as if “star” rhymed with
“balloon; ” then he ran his fingers up and down iº. scales on
the piano, as he had been wont, to do in his old fisherman's home,
when, as a boy, he had played to his father after their late dinner. He
then broke open a box of legal documents, and jumping in among
them bathed himself as it were with deeds, scattering them wildly
right and left of the car.
Then, the strange idea came across him that he was Convocation,
and he tried to shut down the lid upon himself. * * * Then followed a
second of acute consciousness.
He was going mad: he knew it now—too late
The paroxysm again.
... In another hour the full moon was shining down upon a helpless
idiot, sticking pins into the balloon, which was streaming slowly away
towards the horizon.
Suddenly he jumped up, and with a wild laugh struck a match.
He applied it, thoughtfully, to the neck of the balloon.
As this moment his reason resumed its functions.
The fire was spreading !
Was all this treasure to be lost P
Ha! The Parachute.
Lading it as quickly as possible, he lowered it from the car.

A LENTEN ENTERTAINMENT.
MANAGERs are becoming very courteous to one another. Now-a-days
they lend each other an actor or two for the night, with as much
readiness as they would a pocket handkerchief, and with much greater
certainty of the loan being returned. Nay, these theatrical autocrats,
though unwilling to lend themselves to anything, do not appear to
entertain a similar feeling with regard to anybody, for we find them
“letting themselves out” perhaps for a lengthened run.
A Playbill, with a “ loan collection” Company will soon present an
appearance of this sort:-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
DRAMATICUs.-We have your five comedies
with great pleasure, and burned them with §:
th and send in until we leave off burning
ena.
ARCHzoLogist.—The word “shilling” is a corruption of
she-lion, or lioness, which used to be stamped on the
Saxon coinage. Always ask when you don't know,
also when you think you do, as you will most pro-
bably think wrong.
R. A.—He is a very bad painter, but there are worse,
yourself for instance.
A YANKEE.—Congress is not the female of Conger, but
eels are slippery, and so are many of your statesmen.
PIT-Box.-We prefer him to any one else whom we have
:* the part, except Garrick, who lived before
our time.
Toots-We never do read perfumed letters, and they
ought not to be scent through the post. How can
we “smell a rat" above all that vile patchouli ? Com-
parisons may be odorous, as Shakspeare says, but the
paper they are written on may not.
MR. CHAsuble (a Ritualist) is informed that we de-
nounce his nonsense, but that if he can get a church
to himself he may have, as Moore sings, a bright little
aisle of his own.
A YouNg NUMISMAT1st.—The British Museum will
gladly give you ten shillings for an English half-
penny dated earlier than 1800, but you must take it
there yourself, with your baptismal certificate, and
a lock of your hair, not necessarily for publication,
but as a guarantee of good faith.
JAMEs GEDDLEs.-Don't bother us to invent titles for
new magazines. As architectural names are in vogue,
take the Marble Arch, or the Monument, the latter
for choice, as it has what you'll want—capital.
STAMP-Collector.—Most advertisers sell forged postage
stamps. We can't see that they are not quite as good
as genuine ones, but perhaps it is hardly fair to sell
stamps as the production of a country in which such
things are unknown. When you are in doubt, how-
ever, call on the Ambassador for the place in ques-
tion, and is ºrill either certify or condemn the article.
You pay him sixpence a dozea.
Loose Fish.-Yes, we see you Bohemians do not want
to be called so any longer, but you will be, until you
adopt the habits of the Moravians.
ALFonso P.-A father does not deserve to be one, who
when his wife remarked that she thought she heard
baby crying, said that it certainly was very like a
wal
Stopg|E.-Not so bad. He asks when silver is better
than gold * The answer, when the plate comes round
for a collection.
ETYMologist.—Baggaas is the Hampshire for haw-
berries, and the Scotch for a horrible pudding, fit to
be º only by haggies such as the witches in
Afacbeth.
A Constant READER.— That you are not, and what is
the good of telling a falsehood that can be found out?
If you were, you would have seen that we have many
times informed correspondents that the pretty hymn,
How doth the little busy bee,
is by Dr. Cumming, the “Bee-keeper,” and refers to
the bee in his own bonnet, an insect that hums 1868
as the End.
A Bother ED RELATion.—Never quarrel, that is vulgar.
Lend your relative five pounds, and get him to fix a
given day for its return. It will not come, nor will
he, and the release will be cheap.
Hockey.—Write to a sporting paper. We know nothing
about any athletic exercise except smoking. But, on
general principles, we do not know why you should
not purposely bang him over the legs, unless you are
afraid of being licked. It all depends on your respec-
tive sizes—if your friend is the smaller, hit away.
At least, that is the rule of life, and why not of
hockey *
A Young DINER-out wants to know how to prevent soup
from sticking to his moustache, and then dropping
down on his shirt front. Why be anxious about such
a trifle f Cicero would not have minded it, nor would
Solomon, or Demosthenes. A soup-stain shows that
you have dined with some stateliness. But you can
either pass the soup, cut off your moustache, refuse
the invitation, or come late.
GUSHER.—Never be in a hurry to return a kindness.
It will seem much less three months hence, and at
six you will begin to fancy it was you that did it.
ELoisa.-Rogers wrote the Pleasures of Hope, Akenside
the Pleasures of Memory, and Campbell the Pleasures
of lunagination. You should fix this in your mind
without artificial means; but if this is, as you say,
very difficult to you, r ber that Rogers, abanker,
was partner of Hope, the famous banker of Amster-
dam, that memory often leaves an ache inside, and
that a strong imagination is wanted to hear a camp-
bell, as there is no such thing. These mnemonics,
properly studied, will prevent confusion for the rest
of your life.
Pictor INCIPIENs.-It is rather late, perhaps, to com-
mence a picture that shall have at least two hundred
full length figures in it, for the next Exhibition of
the Academy, especially as you ask us for a subject,
and another week is lost before you can read this.
But get to work at once, and do Xerxes counting his
soldiers... You can depict him stopping at the two
hundredth to reprove his courtiers for saying that
the sea would obey him, and the neatherd's cottage
and the burnt cakes could be seen in the distance.
“A CAD."—When we hear fools quote that idiotic Not
for Joseph, we are reminded of the inscription some-
§§ chalked on a lunatic asylum built by Joseph II.
in Wienna.
Josephus, wbique secundus, hic primus.
A WASHERwoman's DAUGHTER.—No ; a cathedral quire
is not so called from the resemblance of the surplices
to clean sheets of paper; quite the contrary.
SAucy JIM.–We never interfere in family squabbles,
but must own that we think your big brother was
ustified in “whopping you." To ask the young
dy on whom he was spoons, why he was like a
hideous mendicant, and to explain that it was because
he was an ugly beggar, deserved the repartee in
question.
A MEMBER of THE ALPINE CLUB.—There is no eleva-
tion in Scotland higher than Primrose Hill, but to
say this made Sawney so outrageous that by the Act
of Union it was provided that the Scotch hills should
be called mountains in public documents, and so the
habit has been preserved. But the barometrical
returns, every day, stare the nonsense in the face
with a contradiction, as Sir Roderick Murchison well
knows.
ELEANort.—Photograph is operly spelt foto -
being named from the tº: }: th F. : . or
bath—one part of the process. But either way will
do. To say that a man is more N. than P. H. mean-
ing that he is more nave than fool, is exceedingly
amusing.
McGRIGoR.—We are not aware of the existence of any
book that will give you an account of Edward the
Confessor, but you might apply to some respectable
Catholic priest, or search the confessions of Rousseau,
or do anything else that occurs to you.
HuMANITY..—Do not ask a carver for calf's flesh until
the animal shall be killed mercifully. You are re-
quested not to speak to the man at the weal.
A YoUNG CHEMIST:-Gellic acid is the chemical name
for cheap claret. Old vines slºe better wine than
young ones. So do old men, or they & ºld fools.
STUDENT.-With pleasure. Un port de reliche is the
name for the theatre door at which Parisian actors go
in when there is no performance.
SHIRLEY WARREN.—Neat enough, for a provincial.
England is not to imitate the French autocrat's ex-
nditure—he may play Unlimited Loo, but not
ggar my Neighbour.
A FELLow of BALIol.—Yes, the Solicitor-General is en-
titled to his fee of six-and-eightpence every time he is
consulted by the sovereign, and he is paid out of the
taxes, which are therefore called his taxed costs. If
a Liberal goes out, and a Tory comes in, or vice versd,
while any fees are unpaid, the costs are taxed as
between party and party.
AN OLD CHEQUE-TAKER.—Yes. The existing represen-
tatives of the historical persons in Shakspeare's trage-
dies (as the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
Lord Hastings, Lord Westmoreland, Duke of Bedford,
&c., &c.) are obliged, under the 12 Geo. II. c. 38, to
attend and act at Drury Lane when the plays are
revived, but not during Lent.
A MoRMon.—Other vermin have religion quite as good
as yours. Tom Moore says—
In the woods of the north there are insects that prey.
PhotoGPAPHER.—The new Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Mr. Ward Hunt, is the godson of Mr. E. M. Ward and
Mr. Holman Hunt, and therefore out of deofilial feel-
ings must desire to protect true art. You'll be taxed.
FANATico.—We have not heard that the charming
prima donna will in future travel for the firm of
“Patti & Caux," but wherever she goes the announce-
ment is “no orders.”
TURNING THE TIME-TABLEs.-We must decline giving
any opinion as to where any metropolitan railway
goes from or takes you to. o person has ever yet
mastered that system, but we believe that half the
cases of persons “missing " arise from their having
believed that they could get from somewhere to
somewhere else. me day a decent map will be
issued
ONE who Distausts “QUEEN's HEADs.”—
Trust not for freedom to the franks,
because they are all abolished. If a stamp comes off,
you must stick it on again, by Gum.
A WIFE who can ARGUE.—Where is your husband's
difficulty? We should answer him thus:—Wiewing
the cosmos of each sentiency as a pure construction
of that sentiency out of its subjective affections, he
may find the reason of the manifest co-operation of
the sentiencies in a law of relation among them-
selves, producing a unanimity of illusion. If that
does not carry conviction to his mind, he had better i
take some more brandy-and-water.
A GUMMER IN of Disconnects.D TRIFLEs.—We cannot
É. you our º of Julius Caesar, because we
ve only one, and it is stuck in an album with his
daguerreo by Dionysius Photographicus, the
Areopagite, but we dare say you can get one from
our neighbour, Mr. Waller, Fleet Street.
Two YoUNG LAdies “want introductions to husbands.”
With pleasure. We have been a husband a long
time, and our secretary is in the same condition.
The young ladies may call, but we don't see what
particular good it will be.
SLightly Excitable asks us whether the Stoics did
not believe in the malignity of matter, and whether
Dean Swift did not say that nothing was more pro-
voking than the perverseness of inanimate things,
and whether Bishop Sandfordº: Merton) did not
find himself continually inclined to forget that such
things had no volition? We were about to reply, like
echo, “in the affirmative," when we happened to
turn over, and to find in a lady's writing (evidently
clandestinely added), “Please don't encourage my
husband in raging and kicking over water-jugs, be-
cause, when washing his hands, the soap slipped into
the fire-place.". We won't. But there is something in
what he is driving at.
LoRD B.-Not going to spoil our eyes over your scrawl.
Get your valet to copy it, and correct the spelling,
and we'll answer you. As far as we can make out
our º: we reply that we will see you
lowed first, but this is a leap in the dark.
PROFEssoR PARTRIDGE.-Thanks, dear old bird. Your
uotation from Punch at your farewell lecture at the
cademy was very happy, and the compliment you
bestowed upon him he receives with a smile. May
your First of September be fifty years off.
TRiPos.-Vulgar be hanged Nothing is vulgar that is
nice. Besides, to like it argues amiability. Cart-
wright, an old writer says, in a play called the
Ordinary,
You never knew
A tripe-eater become a tyrant.
Round Robin.—You are a set of foolish monkeys. The
husband who said that he was going to set up an
apiary, and whose wife asked him where he would
et the apes, ought to have known you. . We shall
{.. the document until some of you attain distinc-
tion, and then we shall print it. You are right not
to be frightened at that menace.
PLEASING LITTLE Lily.—Your handwriting , is not
exactly good, but it is of no consequence, for your
photograph is so pretty, that we are sure no man
who marries you will ever go away, or want to be
writted to. There, is not that a sweet compliment 2
Lector Assidu. –We will encourage you by printing
the epigram which you say you made on a “literary
friend's" declaration that he did not care about
reading.
“I do not care for reading books," says Whizz,
Words which the public echoes, adding—his.
Fifth ForM.—We regret that we have no space for
your clever historical parallel between Leotard's-
muscles and Cockle's pills.
A RUGBY Boy.—The football rules of your school are
disgraceful. We should certainly not say
Come to me like the rugged Rugby Boy;
but should much prefer an interview with an armed
rhinoceros, or, as an Irish tragedian says, a hurricane
tiger. Do you recollect what Vivian Grey said when
his father proposed to send him to a public school?
“Anywhere but Rugby, that's so devilish low."
That's not true now ; but your football rules are, as
Mr. Gladstone says, “worthy of savages.”
DAisy Flower.—Yes, dear, the charming lines from
Wordsworth are as follows:-
Small malice is true malice while it lasts,
Of foes, however humble, spare not one :
The schoolboy, with the snowball that he casts,
Bungs up your eye, and makes you swear like fun.
ANTIPHolus.-We really must decline giving an auto-
schediastic, that is, off-hand opinion upon the con-
nection between Buddhism º the differential cal-
culus.
SANCHO,-Like the majority of proverbs and cisterns,
it will not hold water. “Many men, many minds,”
is a foolish saying, seeing that when many men
meet, there are generally but very few minds among
them, and those are seldom minded.
J. A. FRoude.—How can you? When Mary I. said
that the word “callous" would be found written on
her heart, she showed that she knew herself. Calais
was a blunder of the reporter, Burnet, Bishop of
Salisbury, her Confessor, and author of the Shepherd
of Salisbury Plain, by Richmond.
BAshrul JAMEs.-It is so long since we were courted
and married by our present wife, that we almost
hesitate to advise you; but it seems to us, that when
a young lady, walking with you, insists on lingering
at the rather uninteresting windows of furniture
shops, she means to give you an opportunity of
asking her whether there is any other article you
could show her, say a wedding-ring. But, on the
whole, better let her speak out this Bissextile. If a
man is worth having, he is worth asking for.

SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE.
ºunsel lately applied to WICE-CHANCELLOR MALINs, at the
instance of the Charity Commissioners, to commit SIR Robert PEEL
to Whitecross Street Prison, for disobeying an order to furnish the
Commissioners with the accounts of Tamworth School, of which he is
sole trustee. For these accounts the Commissioners have been bad-
gering SIR RoBERT ineffectually during the last two years.
SIR Robert had been personally served with notice of the motion
at Drayton Manor, but he neither appeared in person nor by counsel.
When a legislator sets such an example of repeated and aggravated
contempt for the laws, those who administer them, of course, are
prompt and severe in showing their sense of his conduct.
The order for commitment was no doubt at once made out, accom-
panied by some severe and well-deserved observations of the WICE-
CHANCELLOR on SIR Robert PEEL's conduct in the matter. But the
case seems to have been strangely mis-reported, for we read that the
WICE-CHANCELLOR said “the notice of motion might have been served
upon SIR RoPERT when he was going out to shoot, and therefore he might
not have read it.”
Clearly this must be some stupid blunder of the reporters. The
Vice-CHANCELLOR knows the duty of his office far too well to suggest
excuses for a manifest contempt of Court following on a course f dis-
respect to a constituted authority, in a matter of public duty.
SIR. Robert might, no doubt, have been going out to shoot, or
to fish, or to hunt, or to bait badgers, or kill rats, or any other
“country contentment,” when the notice was served on him. But
nobody knows better than WICE-CHANCELLOR MALINs that if any
counsel were to put in such a plea before him for a sporting publican,
a dashing linen-draper, or any other variety of the genus “snob,” who
had treated a similar notice of motion with similar contempt, he would
receive, for his impudence, such a rebuke as he would not easily forget.
The blundering ºte: goes on (still putting excuses in the WICE-
CHANCELLOR's mouth):—
“Sir Rouent was probably now at Whitehall, and to afford him an opportunity
of informing him of the present proceeding, the motion must stand overtill a
would be obliged to dispose of the case in
That there is some unaccountable mis-reporting here is clear from
what follows:–
“It turned out that Sir Robert was not in town, and the case was put off for
a week.”
. Evidently, after the VIgE-CHANCELLOR had announced his intention of
disposing of the motion in Sir Ronent's absence, if he did not show,
in person or by counsel, at a quarter-past one, he would not have put
the case off for a week, when a quarter past one came, and º Ilo
SIR. Robert. Nor is it in itself conceivable that a Judge would thus
allow the majesty of the law to be flouted, to suit the convenience
of even the most eccentric of Baronets. -
We conclude, therefore, that the Reporter is utterly and unaccount-
ably at fault throughout this altogether incredible account of these
proceedings.
We can readily believe that SIR Robert PEEL defied the law, and
was insolent in his mode of defying it. What we cannot believe is,
that a Judge was quick to suggest excuses for such defiance, and to
use his power over the business of his Court to shield the offender
from the penalty of it.
Curious Mistake.
An elderly maiden Lady, who has lived all her life in Little Trenid;
dlum, Cornwall, said that she had always considered Westminster Hall
as a sort of Museum for stuffed Notabilities, as she had been invariably
given to understand that it was there you could see “the most distin-
guished men in cases.” Her view was moreover confirmed by the
expression, used, by her young nephew just called to the bar, who told
her that the other 4; he saw *. Hossal R, the eminent Queen's
Counsel, “regularly ‘shut up” in a long case.”

THE ART OF ADVERTISING.
WHERE will the mania for advertising carry people?, Not merely
hoardings but houses are now covered with advertisements. Puffs are
pasted on dead walls and painted upon pavements. Poster-bearers
everywhere perambulate the streets, and omnibuses are made, hideous
by #. placards which disfigure them. Railways are among the worst
offenders in this way. Their stations are let out to advertising agents
and well nigh every carriage is a vehicle for puffery. Puffs are inted
in their time-books, and even on their tickets. “The backs of these
tickets to be let,” was the inscription we saw yesterday upon a railway;
ticket. Perhaps we next may see the backs of railway-guards and
porters covered with advertisements, Why should not other people
also adopt this useful notion? Such a notice, for example, as “My
back to be Let” would speedily, we fancy, attract a crowd of followers:
and such a space would surely be a first-rate medium. Many a puffing
tailor would be glad to make a man a gift of a new coat, on condition
that it bore the maker's name in big red letters on the back: and what
hatter would refuse, to give away a hat, with an advertisement
inscribed conspicuously outside it?
Cutting Their Own Throats.
(A very Irish Division.)
We are told that the Government are prepared to consent to MR.
M'Evoy's Bill, for repealing, the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, on the
understanding that amendments are to be introduced in Committee to
ut. Roman Catholic Prelates in the United Kingdom on the same
ooting as the Catholic º in Canada and other Colonies. This
compromise, we are, told, will be violently opposed by the Ulster
Members, who will take the sense of the House on the Second Reading.
Will they?. It is a pity they should court such an overwhelming
majority against themselves.
ALL UP WITH EXETER HALL.
WALLs are said to have ears. If so, those of Exeter Hall the other
evening must have experienced a sensation. They heard ARCHBISHOP
MANNING hold forth in the capacity of Chairman to the Catholic Tem-
perance Association..., Shade of SpoonBB | WHALLEY, man alive!
Extremes meet. ... Rationalism and Popery are extremes; positive
and negative. Well, certainly there is something rational in what the
members of the Catholic Temperance Association call their “war-cry;”
namely, “We have one enemy-not, drink, but drunkenness, and we
will not rest till we conquer.” Let the United Kingdom Alliance note
the distinction between drunkenness and drink. They have ARch-
Bishop MANNING, however, personally on their side. He advocated
“the necessity of a wise, alteration of the existing law, so as to shut up
the public-house and the beer-shop.” This intolerance is quite con-
sistent with Popish claims to dictation; but the votaries of Bacchus
: have as much right, if they could, to close the Roman Catholic
Chapels.
But a Romanist meeting in Exeter Hall, what a sign of the times,!
§§ is indeed spreading with a vengeance. It was little that High
Church, Parsons, running wild, on theology, went over to Rome.
Fervid dowagers and enthusiastic noblemen turning Papists did not
signify; still less did, the sequacious valetaille who followed, them
because they thought it genteel. But Popery in Exeter Hall ! Roman
Pontifex, thou hast conquered. Government proposes to re the
Ecclesiastical Titles Bill conditionally. Pooh!" Unconditionally;
repeal it altogether. Let the House of Lords change bishops. Pro-
fessing Protestants are now on one platform with Pépists—they had
better profess Protestantism no longer. There is an end of everything.

SCIENTIFIC CRUELTY.
THERE are some things which they certainly do not “manage better
in France,” and the teaching of veterinary surgery is one of them.
Only hear what horrors are sanctioned by French schools:-
“Each veterinary student is obliged to practise twice on the living animal from
twenty to thirty operations. . . . . . At Lyons eight or twelve vivisections are per-
formed within two hours, at the end of which time the animal is destroyed, if not
already dead from agony and loss of blood.”
The “animal” referred to is that noble one the horse, and we mean
no joke in saying that by cruelties like these the heart of a young
id: must certainly be ossified. French veterinary surgeons *
clearly bigger, brutes than, those on which they operate... Even
HoGARTH, in his E. of the School of Cruelty, has not equalled the
tortures which take place in the French schools. In England the dis-
secting-room suffices for instruction of the student, and no one ever
dreams of ºf the horrors of the scientific torture-chamber.
Vivisection in another sense would be performed here on the surgeons
who were needlessly to practise it, for every living man of them would
certainly be cut by every one who knew him.

It is announced that the Court will go into mourning for his late

The facts related by a contemporary in the following announcement
will supply our friends the pessimists with some addition to the grati-
; evidence, afforded by contemporary history, of a receding civi-
isation :-
“THE PRoduction of Chassepots.-According to the Progrès of Lyons great
ctivity prevails at present in the imperial manufactory of small arms at St. Etienne.
In that establishment and in the private workshops of the town twelve thousand
men are employed. Nine hundred Chassepot muskets can now be supplied daily."
Hooray!, Nine hundred contrivances for killing and maimin
people are daily producible for the benefit of mankind. Nine hund
thaumaturgic instruments for the working of wonders on the human
frame–miracles of slaughter, of lacerations, compound comminuted
fractures, and tracts of traversed muscular fibre mashed into pulp. And
these wonders, if needful, are ready to be wroughton behalf of the Pope's
temporal power. Truly the world is moving in a right direction—to
the right about. Worthily are such illustrations of its present march
recorded in the Progrès of Lyons. Of course that journal is an organ
of the progressive movement of Europe in which France is endeavouring
with all her energies to take the lead. The Progrès of Lyons repre-
sents the walk of a crab. Only civilisation seems to be going the
crab's way at the speed of a racehorse.
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED,
“THE Bheels have risen at Punch.” To allay the apprehension that
the majority of civilised beings will feel at this alarming intelligence,
wherever the sun rises or sets, Mr. Punch has fº. up a quarter of an
hour earlier to assure the nobility, clergy, and gentry of the hemi-
spheres and the vicinity, that he is not the person or party (there is
good authority in the English classics for this use of the word) referred
to in the disturbing announcement quoted above. . No Bheels have
risen at him, although he has now and then taken a rise out of BEALEs.
Whether some Indian namesake, a learned pundit, of course, has been
attacked by insurgent contributors, Mr. Punch, is at present unable to
say, but he has telegraphed to SIR John Law RENCE for information,
and instructed him to march instantly with all his chivalry and cavalry
to the relief of the sufferer, if only the most distant connection of the
great house of Punch. Meanwhile, notice has been given to SIR
Šºrčan Noºracote that he will be interpellated as to the meaning
of this appalling rumour, and all the iron-clads, including the Hercules,

A CREDIT TO THE CITY OF LONDON.
THE Weekly Dispatch announces that:—
“The Commissioner of the City Police is to have his salary raised from £1,000 to
£1,350 a year."
The Corporation of London is to be congratulated on its appreciation
of valuable services. The office of a Commissioner of Police is no less
honourable than that of a Field-Marshal, whilst it is much more
onerous, for the Police Chief is always on active service. The City
...' does show a due estimate of policemen. The gallant protec-
tors of life and property within the domains of Gog and Magey are all
fine able-bodied men, who look as if they were accustomed to live on
prize beef. This argues decent pay. lf Scotland Yard were in the
City, SIR RICHARD MAYNE, ere now, would doubtless have received
his full retiring pension.
“And doth not a Meeting like this make Amends?”
LoRD CHELMsFoRD, having been presented with the sack, has had
an interview with LORD DISRAELI (we anticipate the title), who
deprived him of the woolsack. As to what transpired at this affecting
interview, the newspapers unkindly have left us in the dark: excepting
that, they mention that LoRD C. and MR. D. (we cancel our anticipa.
tion) had “shaken hands” ere parting, and this, in certain circles, is
commonly the prelude of a regular set-to.

PUNCH's ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
oNDAY, March 9. The new LoRD
CHANCELLORCAIRNs introduced
a Bankruptcy Bill, and a Bill for
abolishing Arrest for Debt—not
a bad inauguration feat.
Health stated to the Commons
that the Department of Science
and Art was publishing the “Art
Catalogue” in Notes and Queries
and that the ultimate cost would
be about. £8000. It is the only
dull reading in the pages of our
delightful contemporary, and if
LORD Robert MonTAGU would
give us the £8000, we would un-
dertake to supply articles much

Water in the Regent's Park
would be replaced, with a con-
crete bottom, before summer. He

be late; but if LoRD JoHN meant that the present hideous black
wilderness would-be-converted into !. Water by the 24th of
June, he had betterwalk-over from Cumberland Terrace, and note the
rate at which the work is proceeding.
The new CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer—but would you like to
know what he islike? Thussaith the trustworthy Correspondent of the
Inverness Courier:—
“The House is very well disposed towards MR. WARD. HUNT, who has always
been popular among the Members. His personal presence is much in his favour.
He might almost sit for Punch's typical portrait of John Bull. To be sure, he
stands upwards of six-feetin his stockings, and his head seems rather small to be a
proper capital for such a massive-column, but his countenance is frank and jovial,
expressing bluffmanners, good .. and resolute will. His finance reputation is
yet to be acquired, but it is generally supposed that MR. DiskAELI will lend him a
hand, in the composition at least of his first budget.”
The New PREMIER lent him a hand to-night, to help him to carry a
little Bill about Irish Fines and Fees; but the loan was not useful.
The Bill did not seem of the slightest consequence; but the Irish
Members raised objections to it, and SIR PATRick ÖBarºn said that
it would throw all the Irish counties into confusion for the small sum
of £60,000. We should have thought so much fun would have been
cheap at the money; but Irishmen are not now as TYRONE Power
depicted them, and go in for the gravities. Government had to give
up the Bill.
The Scotch Reform Bill was read a Second Time after a very dull
debate, not graced by the presence of more than half of the Scotch
Members. Our old friend, MR, HADFIELD, of Sheffield (actat. 82),
moved the rejection of the Bill, because it proposed to increase the
numbers of the Commons. MR. SModlett (great-grandnephew of
ToBLAs) warned the House that the effect of the Bill would be to
exclude gentlemen from the Legislature in favour of municipal spouters
and rich railway jobbers. Under-Secretary SiR JAMEs FERGusson let
out that if the Scotch particularly wanted two or three more Members,
Government might not be disobliging. But we wait for BAxTER’s Last
Words. He wants to drive a harder bargain.
We don't want to frighten anybody, but a Bill for making Subways
under us all is before the House. We believe that the object is to
accumulate the gas, which escapes from the pipes, with a view to
blowing a parish or so into the air, in case Fenians are thought to be
lurking about. MR. PAULL, of St. Ives (how are the Seven Wives,
with their sacks, cats, and kits *), will give further information.
Tuesday. To-night began the Great Irish Debate. It went on until
Friday, inclusive, and was then adjourned... Mr. Punch, with his calm
smile of superiority, begs leave to suppose that he can deal in a much
more masterly fashion with the Irish Debate than the House could do
with the Irish. Difficulty. He is the friend of mankind, and therefore
has no intention of afflicting it with any amplified account of the
orations delivered on this occasion. He proposes to be Essential: and
Essence, according to Locke, is the Very Being of Anything; and, in
common parlance, the principal, constituent, concentered qualities.
The word is corrupted from Eristentia. There, you shall learn some-
...” an Irish Debate, an achievement hitherto thought im-
possible.
We met to learn from the CHIEF SecretaRY FoR IRELAND what were
the intentions of Government in regard to that “interesting” island.
LoRD MAYo talked for three hours; and, on the second night of the
º MR. HoRsMAN neatly summed up the statement in three
Words:
INACTION.
PRocrastiNATION. RetRogression.
The President of the Board of
more to the liking, we imagine,
The Chief Commissioner of:
A very slight dilution of this very concentrated essence will adapt it
to all palates.
| A. Inaction.—Nothing is to be done with the Irish Church until the
Commission shall have reported, and this, said a Member of it,
may be two or three months. We may add that Lord MAYo
declared that Government would tolerate no “levelling” policy—
which, means that the present Cabinet will not touch the Irish
Church. Did not LoRD CAIRNs's appointment announce that
to all who have understanding f
B. Procrastination.—A new and “roving” Commission to inquire
| into the relations of landlord and tenant. (Laughter.)
C. Retrogression.—Primary education to be left in the hands of the
| present Commission. A University, for Catholics only, to be
endowed by the nation. .
But it would not do to promise nothing at all in the way of an imme-
diate instalment, and LoRD MAYo seems to have acted in the spirit of
the commercial traveller, immortalised, pictorially, by Mr. Punch.
“Now, waiter, what is the smallest sum I can give you, without being
considered mean ** The CHIEF SECRETARY promised
To bring in a Bill that should secure compensation to tenants
for improvements, should increase the leasing powers of limited
owners, and should encourage written contracts between tenant and
Owner.
| This is the Government solution of the Irish Question.
| MR. MAGUIRE opened the debate with an able speech. We compli-
ment him on the moderation of his language, but it was his business to
make a black picture, and he laid on the black vigorously. LoRD MAYo,
111 iº scraped a good deal of it off with success. MR. MAGUIRE urged
that Ireland was under soldier government. LoRD MAYo said that it was
for the P. of the Irish, and that all the officials were Irish, and
many of them Catholic. MR. MAGUIRE showed that Ireland was in a
state of decay, and LoRD MAyo showed that she was in a state of
advance. Ms. MAGUIRE contended for the destruction of the Church,
but Lord MAYo argued that this would be unjust, and also useless.
And so assertion was met by contradiction.
MR; NEATE attacked MR. M.ILL's proposal that Government should
forcibly buy the land and re-sell, and likened MR. MILL to JACK CADE.
| But the debate was renewed on Thursday with much more spirit.
Three Great Bounding Brothers leaped into the arena and did their best.
| MR. HoRsMAN made a very dashing attack upon the Government for
having no policy, and for, consequently, doing nothing. He denied
the loyalty of Ireland, he denounced the Church, and he declared that
the present Parliament ought to deal with the Question.
R. Lowe despised the Fenians, disapproved of the new University,
and was very condemnatory of ultramontanism. . He pulled MR.
|MILL's plan to pieces, with much energy. He was for destroying the
Church, but he evidently regards the Irish as very imperfect and
| objectionable creatures, utterly inferior to Englishmen, and disposed
to give much more trouble than they are worth.
MR. MILL (behold him above) described the Government Scheme as
a beggarly account of empty boxes, and defended his own plans. He
accused MR. Lowe of not understanding political economy, and said
that what was good political economy for England would not be so for
Ireland, or for the savages of New Zealand. He cannot speak without
being original, and he retorted the taunt of Utopianism by calling
Kºi... -
A maiden speech of MR. JAcob BRIGHT, who rejoiced that a new
political power had arisen, that of working-men who had no vested
interests in injustice and wrong, -and a vigorous reply on the whole
§§ MR. HARDY, were the other noteworthy matters of the Second
ight.
On Friday, MR. Chichester Fortescue (a past and future Minis-
ter), intimated that Government must not be “permitted” to turn a
deaf ear to the Irish appeal for justice. The O'Donoghue, boasted
that the immense majority of the Irish were disaffected, and he got it
rather hot from LoRD CLAUD HAMILTON for assisting at the coffin pro-
cessions in honour of the Manchester Murderers. MR. NEW DEGATE
denounced the Jesuits as inciters to Fenianism. But the event of the
night was a very fine speech from MR. BRIGHT, who was heard with
admiration on all hands, and complimented by the Indian Minister for
his eloquence and sincerity. We seldom quote; but must give part of
his peroration for the benefit of those who read no reports :-
“I would counsel to all men moderation and justice. We are after all, I believe,
of one religion. I imagine that there will come a time in the history of the world
when men will be astonished that Catholics and Protestants have had animosity
and suspicion amongst each other. I accept the belief in a very grand passage,
which I once met with in the writings of the illustrious founder of the colony of
Pennsylvania. He says that “The humble, meek, merciful, just, pious, and devout
souls are everywhere of one religion, and when death has taken off the mask they
will know one another, though the diverse liveries they wear here make thern
strangers.' Now, may I ask the House to act in this spirit, and then our work will
be easy. An inspired king and bard and prophet has left us words which are not
only the expression of a fact, but which we may take as the utterance of a prophesy.
He says—‘To the upright there ariseth light in the darkness." Let us try in this
matter to be upright. Let us try to be just. The dangers which we see will vanish,

and we may have the happiness perhaps of leaving to our children the heritage of
honourable citizenship in a united and prosperous empire.”
The Debate was adjourned until the following Monday. .
Among the smaller matters of the week were an admission by MR.
HARDY that the system of Baby-Farming (exposed so admirably by MR.
ERNEs.T HART in the British Medical Journal, to which reference was
made) was atrocious, but he did not see his way to interference—a
revival of the Cromwell Statue Question, whereof more when we get
LoRD JoHN's final answer—the carrying, by a large majority, the Abo-
lition Clause in MR. GLADstone's Anaesthetic Bill for *ś.
Church Rates—a statement that, the Albany has stopped the Burling:
ton House Works, and very likely the Academy will not move in 1869
—and that the Lords on Friday enjoyed what may be called a rattling
mill between the DURE OF ARGYLL and the LoRD CHANCELLOR about
the PREMIER’s “Education of his Party” Speech, and the letter
explaining it away. Both lads did all they knew, both were much
punished, and the claret flowed freely. The veteran Russell awarded
the stakes to the Duke, but the decision was contested, and the result
was a wrangle. -
THE ENCORE THIEF.

air, “Deeper, and Deeper still,” and the audience had been goo
enough to signify the warmest, approbation. ... He sat down, when
the prisoner, with violent shouts, demanded that the air should be
given over again. Many of the audience indignantly protested against
the prisoner's dishonest conduct, but he persisted in his attempt at
theft, and was at last i. into º: MR. REEVEs added that
..f. the attempt at robbery had been directed against himself per-
sonally, he appeared on public grounds, and had no windictive feelin
against the prisoner, who, he thought, was stupid rather than wicked,
and perhaps might be dismissed with an admonition.
The Prisoner said that he would not be called stupid. He liked

he hoped any similar offender would be taken into custody, and brought

THE DANGER OF SELF-DEFENCE.
..MR.G.THACKER, Farmer, of Brownhills, Norton, hears a noise in
his father's fowl-pen, at night. He takes a gun, and, accompanied by
his sister, goes to the spot with a candle. A man, who had been
robbing the pen, springs out upon him, and knocks the candle ſrom his
hand. There is a struggle between them; the gun goes off by acci-
dent, and the thief, one JAMEs HAMER, a miner, is shot dead. State-
ments of these facts were deposed before a coroner's jury. A report
of the case thus concludes:–
“This completed the evidence, and the jury were left to consider their verdict;
and after a short time they found that the deceased was killed by the gun acci-
dentally going off in the struggle. MR. G. Thacker will, in due course, be taken
before the Magistrates on the charge of having caused the death of HAMER.”
A coroner's jury finds that a thief, in a struggle with a respectable
man, on his father's premises, was accidentally shot, and “in due
course” the respectable man is taken before Magistrates on the charge
of having caused the thief's death. This is practical logic, so far as it
goes. To make it perfect the Bench should have committed the
accused for trial on a charge of manslaughter, or º: murder.
let honest men know that the idea of shooting a thief, even in self.
defence, is not to be entertained. When, therefore, you go to disturb
a fellow who is robbing your house, you had better never take such a
thing as a gun with you, lest you should have the misfortune to be
involved in a grapple with him, and chance to shoot him.

THE POPE AND THE PETTICOATS.
In spite of what the song says, it may be questioned if the Pope has
recently been living a very “happy life.” Besides his cares of state,
and fears about his throne, other smaller worries have been troubling
his existence. The ladies have annoyed him by their vanities of dress,
and by coming to his churches decked out as for the opera, and flaunt-
ing their fine fashions in his holy face. His Holiness is one of the
best tempered of men; but the flaring, glaring way in which the women
have been going it has been enough to “rile a saint,” as a Mormonite
would say. So we can hardly be *#. that, speaking to an audience
of some two hundred ladies, His Holiness gave vent to the following
strong terms:-
“His Holiness severely censured the licence of the toilette, condemning the
‘fantastic headdresses" in use, and the ‘scandalously indecent' robes. He exhorted
his audience to *:::::: to such “propaganda of the devil,' a counter display of
modest feminine attire."
“Propaganda of the devil!” There’s a stinging phrase for you !
What a contrast to the pretty words which ladies generally use when
they chat about their toilettes! Fancy a duck of a new dress, or a
darling, sweet silk jacket, being stigmatised as “propaganda of the
devil”! Still, without, exactly echoing such strong . as the
Pops's, we agree with him in thinking that a lady should dress de-
cently...When loyely woman stoops to the folly of absurdly following
the fashion, she is pretty sure of spending all her thoughts upon her
toilette, and will not think much of a lecture, even from the Pops.
But to our mind, any lady must be a proper goose, who stoops to
wearing dresses “fantastic and indecent” like those which are Old-
Nick-named the devil's propaganda.

WILSON ?
ANOTHER CRY FROM THE CUSTOMS.
A week or two ago Mr. Punch called public notice to the fact that a
great grumbling had reached him from the Custom House. The
clerks there, it was stated, were the worst paid of all the Civil servants|
of JoBN BULL, and, as they had this grievance, like Englishmen they
grumbled at it., With his usual benevolence il. Punch, took up their
case, and . to MR. BULL, through their mutual, friend LoRD
DERBY, who then managed his affairs. In the course of his complaint
Mr. Panch was pleased to tender his advice to MR. BULL, that he had
better behave liberally and pay his servants well, than get the name of
being a stingy, screwy, skinflint, whom everyone, that worked for him
would do their best to cheat. - -
MR. BULL of course has listened to the Voice of Wisdom, and the
Chancellor of his Exchequer is engaged, with other experts, incalculating
what may be the smallest sum that MR. BULL can offer to his servants,
in increase of their wages, without its looking mean. When this
problem has been solved, Mr. Punch will have to state if he approves
of the solution. Meanwhile he begs to mention that the Custom-house
in London is not, the only place where British customs, are collected,
and where British Customs, clerks are miserably paid., M.R., BULL
should blush to read such a statement as the following, lately put forth
in the Civil Service Gazette :-
“In connection with the memorial of the London Clerks of H.M.'s Customs, under
consideration of the Treasury, we are glad to learn that the clerks at the principal
outports have, with the Board's permission, forwarded applications to their Lord-
* That the grievances complained of by their London brethren are felt in a
s greater degree by the Outport Clerks is undeniable, and we trust that the
anxiously expected amelioration will be extended to all the clerks throughout the
Service, and that the irritation and discontent arising from the exceptional treat-
ment which has so long characterised the department may henceforth and altogether
cease.”
“Irritation and discontent” among your servants, MR. BUIL?...And
you, stupidly pretend to boast of being a good master, Sir? ... Good
workers want good wages, and when men are discontented with the
money they receive, they are apt by human nature, to render service
grudgingly, and neglect their work. Depend on it, you will not find
it pay you to be stingy, even at your outports. For only look at this,
ir :-
“There can be no good reason why the Outport Clerks who collect one-half of the
entire Customs revenue, should be differently treated from their London brethren
who collect the other half, or that the same work and equal responsibility should be
better remunerated at one port than at another. Let these invidious distinctions
be swept away, and a liberal scale be arranged for the whole body of the clerks,
and the committee now at work at the Treasury, will have succeeded in removing
one of the most glaring anomalies in the Service, and securing the heartfelt grati-
tude of a great department of the State.”
With such a property at stake as your Customs, MR. BUIL, you are
silly to be stingy to those who are collectors of it. The better, you
pay them, the better you will find their service will pay you. Your
new manager has declared that he will do his very best to pursue “a
liberal policy,” and, in the small matter of paying your poor Customs
Clerks, you will be wise if you insist upon his §. to his word.
A BISHOP IN PARTIBUS
(Heligo-landium),
THE Society for the Propagation of the Gospel is collecting funds
for the establishment of an Anglican Bishop for North Germany, with
Heligoland for his see!
Heligoland is a small sandy island, some thirty miles from the mouth
of the Elbe, belonging to England, with a population of some three
thousand frisians, and, as many rabbits, a banished British Governor,
and a good many publics, lodging-houses, and gambling saloons. It
is in short a sort of Hamburg Margate—but a Margate at once marred
and gated Oceano dissociabili; a Margate towed out to sea, as it were,
and moored some twenty miles outside of the Goodwins.
“Bishop of Heligoland” sounds comical. He certainly will have a
see to overlook, but it will be the German Ocean, and it is difficult to
imagine what duties he will find to do (now that the duties are taken
off most things that enter the island) unless it be that of, exchanging
confidences and condolences with that." Banished Lord,” the British
Governor. We can imagine these heads; of the Church and State of
Heligoland, “by the sad sea-waves,” and “we listen while they moan”
—not the waves, but the Governor and Bishop-first antiphonically,
then chorally, to some such effect as this: ,
Antiphonically, }}
Governor. The sea’s all about !
Bishop. Fled are croupier and tout !
Governor. The bathers are gone.'
Bishop. And the play-season’s done !

Aºtiphonically,

'Neath my parental sway !
Bishop. Here I’m a British Bishop, with no Anglicans to scold-
In a Hierarchal way !
Governor. So here we both are stranded,
Bishop. Landed here and Heligo-landed,
Chorally.

ANTISTROPHE.
Antiphonically.
Governor. Would we were countermanded, English Church and State
disbanded,
And º punters, handed to the Prussian pipe-clay

Bishop. For in our opinions candid, there’s nothing on this sand-
ead,
For a Bishop to look over, or a Governor to rule.
Governor. Here’s no Church for Confirmation,
Bishop. And no Commons for jawbation,
Chorally.
Governor and Bishop. Oh, would we were recalled, and our passage
paid to Goole !
Antiphonically.
Governor. For that’s the Port of Hull.
Bishop. Which it’s flat, and very dull,
Governor. But of life and lark it’s full,
Bishop. Compared with the strand of Heligoland,

Chorally.
Governor and Bishop. And pop at the rabbits that burrow the sand!
Roman and Improbable.
A New Cardinal is to be made, says a Correspondent from Rome.
Is it to be an Englishman? The Papal Court, on dit, is somewhat

there's a publisher with a name made to hand: why not let us have

In the pleasantest room of the pleasantest house in one of the
Benician Islands, built in the Gothic style upon the crater of an appa-
rently extinct volcano, sat an elderly man and a young lady.

In a second something flew from his hand, and, whirring past his
niece's ear, within an inch of her golden hair, was dashed into a thou-
sand fragments against the mantelpiece.
It was the tea-cup.”
Her eye darkened for a moment, where a splint from the crockery
had struck her, but she soon recovered her good humour, and playfully
taking up the classic urn, poured the contents upon her uncle's head.

“The sooner the better,” she returned, replying to his observation

Their house, better furnished than any other in the island, had been
carefully fitted up with dumb bells, so as not to disturb the Lieu-
tenant's repose, who was something of an invalid.
She sounded, and an intelligent Boomerang entered the room.
"Clear away,” she said, addressing him in his own language.
The Boomerang, a fine handsome fellow, regarded his young mistress
with an expression of unutterable, melancholy, and commenced his
evening's work, using his feet like hands, with a dexterity which only
early education could have given him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Sometimes as she cast downther eyes, the poor Boomerang was
| sighing at her feet. - -
While these domestic arrangements are being carried out, let us say
a few words about MR. PIEL DoRNTON. . - -
The Rev. PIEL DoRNToN had been in the island for nearly sixteen
years. He was very rich. He had enormous feet and hands; no one
knew how they had been acquired. He had nº relations; that is in
the island; nor did he speak of any one cºnnected with him as existing
elsewhere.' He was unmarried; at least he had always given out as much.
in build he was if anything somewhat above the middle height, with a
strong leaning towards corpulency, which in a man of twice his stature,
and of a less emaciated appearance, would have been unnoticed, or
,would have passed for an evident mark of good breeding; but in
jonºron it led the shrewd external observer to a wrong estimate of a
character which was in other respects amiable, though perhaps a little
too reserved for his associates. Generally, and among those of the
other sex, especially his coleopterous propensities were the theme
unbounded admiration. -
off. Trist, who illustrates this work, will perfect the sketch."
On his arrival in the island he had announced himself as a Clergyman,
and the good Bishop, having immediately collated and inducted him,
subsequently, gave him letters of introduction to all the most, savage
tribes, among whom the proficiency of the new minister upon the harp
of Ancient Judah was to have been soon turned to account by the
astute prelate.
But for one person.
GRACE MARCHMONT ft
Or another? - - -
Was GRACE always in his thoughts? Perhaps.
OR ANY OTHER Woman P - a tº
Rising from his solitary meal, the Clergyman said “Grace,” after
dinner, to himself, and walked down towards, the shore. y
It was the cheapest and shortest route to the Lieutenant's house.
“Why give more?” he asked himself, as he descended the steep.
Footsteps behind him 1 |
He peered over the ledge of the rock; nºt a soul. . . .
Taking from his neck the badge of his calling, he paid it out over the
cliff. When it had reached downwards, some two hundred feet or so,
he carefully fastened it to the stem of an old tree. -
Chuckling to himself, the Clergyman readjusted what remained of
his white tie, and walked slowly on. -
No footsteps this time, but a young man in a boat.
The Rºy. PIEL DoRNTON shuddered. . . - -
“Bah!” he muttered to himself, “this is cowardice!” and filling
a tumbler of brandy from a magnum, which he invariably carried in
his breast-pocket, he drank it off.
“So,” he said, “Calmer now. Calmer.” -
He could read two names on the boat. “The Penguin, by Joseph.”
Slowly he drew forth a pistol, and pointing it steadily at the oars-
man, took such sure and certain aim—
CHAPTER W.
SLowLY he drew forth a pistol, and pointing it steadily at the oars-
man, took such sure and certain aim as would have undoubtedly
terminated Joseph’s existence, but that it was unloaded.
It flashed across his memory now that he had been at the Episcopal
Palace in the early morning, and there had seen
The Bishop drawing a charge.
Little had he then thought how it would affect his after career.
t The man in the boat, Joseph, looked up on hearing the snap of the
rigger.
“Pas pour Joseph!’t he sang out in a clear tenor voice, touching
his cap reverently to the Ecclesiastic, and at the same time giving a
strong pull with {j sculls, which caused him to disappear within the
water-cave.
The Clergyman remained wrapped in meditation.
* The Artist begs to state he has not been treated fairly; that is, if this is the
hero. He understood him to be quite a different character. He will not alter his
drawing. They may call the picture somebody else, if they like, and write up to it.
But he is not prepared for coleopterous people. , (Artist.)
- Editor's Note.--Beautiful picture, but finished perhaps just a little bit too soon
before the Authors had entirely agreed upon the character of their work. Everyone
is very much pleased with it, and the Editor does hope he may depend upon the
good feeling, forbearance, and gentlemanly tone of all concerned in this New Novel
not to bring about a rupture, where everything should be, and indeed in reality
is, one harmonious unity.
t The Author, who wished this tale to be a Poem, in Seven Books, using his
liberty of publishing a note, begs to record his own conviction that this is the place
for a song. Besides mention having just been made of the harp, what fitter oppor.
tunity can present itself? Again, “MARCHMONT" rhymes with “parchment”
sufficiently for all practical purposes.
Editor's Note:-The Editor, with the other Authors and Directors, has promised
that a song shall be put in on the first opportunity. The Editor and the rest reserve
to themselves the right of judging when such opportunity occurs. But at the same
time the Editor does really hope he may depend upon the good feeling, forbearance,
and gentlemanly tone of all concerned, &c. &c. (wide previous note).

Once there did the dwelling stand
Of a wight famed wide and far;
Who surpassed in name Old PARR.
But it fell upon a day—
Down, right souse,
Came the house
Of PROFEssoR HollowAY.
O PROFEssoR HollowAY!
'Twas upon a Saturday,
Thy house fell;
Fare thee well,
O PROFEssoR HollowAY!
There, a quacksalver by trade,
HollowAY, compounded Pills;
There a certain Ointment made.
They would cure all human ills
He declared in puffs and bills.
But one morning it gave way.
Down it went,
Tenement
Of PROFEssoR HollowAY,
O Professor, &c.
Space to make for Courts of Law,
It would soon have had to fall;
This had forced him to withdraw,
Men, slabs, mortars, pots and all.
Therefore crumbling roof and wall,
When they came down, as we say,
With a rush,
Did not crush
Sham PROPEssoR HollowAY.
O Professor, &c.
But, auspicious omen, hail |
Thou in Hº: º: clear
Emblem to the dullest eye,
Quackery's downfal to be near ;
May thy verity appear !
- Quacks. on public health who prey,
Read your fate,
Sealed when, late,
Fell the House of HollowAY!
O Professor, &c.
From that Eternal City.
THERE has been a creation of Cardinals this last week at Rome.
It may not be generally known that the first thing Cardinals do after
their great elevation, is to collect themselves, and send round the Hat.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“IGNORAMUS” ON SOME GEOGRAPHICAL TROUBLES.
S I was waiting, this morn-
ing, for an “Atlas,” I step-
ped into a shop, and bought
a map, to help me to un-
derstand the newspaper
articles on “Russophobia,”
and Central Asia, a distant
district which, for aught I
knew to the contrary, might
be that Asia Major I am
always expecting, to turn up
as the indispensable counter-
part of Asia Minor; an Ox-
ford training having taught
me to believe that where
there’s a Minor there must
also be a Major. -
The purchase of this map
set methinking of the many
maps and atlases I had been
obliged to buy during the
last fifteen years—indeed,
ever since my interest in
Epirus and the Ægean began to slacken-and of the many lessons in Modern Geography I
had been constrained to give myself, to fill out my spare education, and effect my rescue from
the total darkness of ignorance in which I must otherwise have blundered on, touching
those various regions of the earth where War has left so many deep and crimson scars to
attest her terrible presence.
I believe I first began to impoverish myself in this way when the war with Russia broke
out; making excursions into the Crimea, plunging into the Black Sea and the Baltic, and dip-
ping into the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, which last-mentioned expanse of waters I had
always taken to for its melodious name, and fanciful association, in my very irregular mind,
with a favourite pear. The next item in my expenditure with MAPPMAN was for India, of
which rather important country, previous to the rebellion, I had possessed but little more than
what may be termed a nursery knowledge, mainly represented by TIPPoo SAIB, tigers in
jungles preparing to spring on defenceless white men, the Black Hole at Calcutta, the Great
Mogul, crossing-sweepers in white turbans, the cruel Car of Juggernaut, and, above all,
the burning of widows, considered by far the best thing to think of just before going to
sleep on a winter's night in a warm bed, which, for the occasion, might be looked on as
the mail from London to York, with the wind driving the rain against the windows. A
serious geographical trouble was the war, between Austria, and France and Italy, with
its—the constant intrusion of this antagonist on my privacy was such an annoyance that I
must beg the printer to employ small capitals—QUADRILATERAL, and notorious battle-fields
chiefly remembered now by new dyes and bright dresses. But no part of the globe involved
me in so much anxiety as Schleswig-Holstein, for years the terror of newspaper readers,
the bore in the European family, the poor relation always dropping in and never welcome,
until at last Prussian and Dane came to blows, and compelled us to determine whether
S.-B. was a º: myth or a geographical reality, and, to explore in maps provinces of
which I, and I dare to say, tribes more of the “better educated classes,” were as ignorant
as we are to this day of Lapland or Turkistan.
All over the world have I known trouble.,. Danubian Principalities, Japan, Poland, China,
States of the Church, Bhootan, Lombardy, Mexico and Austria, have been heavy trials; but
never did I picture myself so far from home and ten to four as Abyssinia. RasselAs
Where’s RAsselAs? Just stepped out, Sir, to Fleet Street to ask how his friend SAMUEL
Johnson is, after attending his Mother's funeral at fighfield. Jºs BRUCE, Esq.-he
was here a moment ago telling me there were no musical instruments, not even a lyre, in
Abyssinia—where has he ; To dine in Arlington Street with HoRACE WALPole and
GeoRGE Selwyn, and relate to them those marvellous stories about juicy steaks cut from
live oxen, which CAMERON, and RAssam, and STERN, may some day confirm in the º
narratives we are all hoping they will soon return to deliver in the rooms of the Roy
Geographical Society, Burlington House, Piccadilly.
Aden is now familiar to me as Household Troops, Annesley Bay has displaced Pegwel
Bay in my regard, and Massowah and Zoulla are no mere acquaintances, but friends of long-
standing, like Margate and Ramsgate. And yet could I draw an outline map of the country?
I doubt it, so great is the depression in my cranium where the prominence denoting philo-
; ought to be; for all my life long I have experienced the greatest difficulty in
istinguishing a peninsula from a promontory, and the shock I felt on Saturday evening last
on finding that there was a sea of which I had never even heard—the Ochotsk Sea—I have
not yet recovered from. But there is something else than the geography of Abyssinia to
comment on. What was your guess when you read that the Aboona of Abyssinia was dead P
If I had seen such an announcement under the head of the Zoological Gardens, Regent’s
Park, I should have expected to find that the Aboona was a rare animal of the country
which had died unexpectedly through change of scene and diet. As it was I suspect
my thoughts ran on a favourite Sultana of KING THEODoRE's. , All wrong, the Aboona
being Abyssinia's Archbishop of Canterbury, whose life, let us hope, was not disturbed
# such a diversity of clergy and variety of robe and ritual as prelates in England suffer
rout.
But I must, end, and it shall be, where I began, in Central Asia. , I must take my map
home and study it. .I must be ready with my geographical knowledge against the time for
which articles and letters are already preparing us, when the Oxus and Jaxartes (only rivers,
I assure you, not, especially Jaxartes, pagan divinities) will be admitted into the best society,
and met with at every London dinner-table; when Cashmere will have other costly asso.

IGNORAMUs.
WE DON'T BELIEVE HALF OF IT.
A LETTER from the Capital of Civilisation,
Liberty, Morality, Wisdom, and Human Excel.
lence in every particular, especially Refinement
and Elegance with Economy in Female Dress,
informs us that:—
“What is called the imperial pamphlet, under the
title of “Les Titres de la Dynastie Napoléonienne,' has
appeared with the motto of ‘Voz populi vow: Dei,'"
NAPOLEoN THE THIRD calls himself EMPE-
RoR, both Dei gratid and by the will of the
French people. According to the motto of his
Imperial Majesty's pamphlet, these appear to be
just º: for one thing.
Did *. people once shout Les aris-
tocrats à lanterne? This was vow populi
certainly. Another le, once upon a time,
shouted for a certain BARABBAs. That was
voz populi too. What more can be said in such
cases, unless you add voa diaboli & The Univer-
sal Suffrage to which the French People owe
their Second Empire, and present freedom of
the Press, liberty of meeting, and immunity
from oppressive conscription, was surely no
better than vow populi, if it was no worse.
When the Man of December adopts for the
motto of his Monarchy, Vor populi voz Dei,
does he not rest his title on the ground of a
saying which at best expresses only a half-
truth?
There is a cry which has been heard here in
Englard by the Elect of the French People,
whose forces now hinder the people of Rome
from electing their own Sovereign. The British
public sometimes cries “No Popery !” Here
you have voºr populi. Does Louis NAPOLEON
consider it also voz Dei?
WEARING THEIR OWN HAIR AGAIN.
HERE is a delightful piece of news from
Paris :—
“At the last Ball at the Hôtel de Wille a revolution
was apparent in the ladies' style of headdress. No chig-
nons, but the hair flowing over the shoulders, and a
ringlet or two drawn in front, after the manner in-
troduced by the PRINCEss of WALEs in 1863.”
Crinoline has gone the way of all departed
fashions, and chignons now are doomed to follow
the same fate. In cases such as these there is
no appeal against the Judgment of Paris.
Venus bows to Paris in all matters of the
toilette, and Ugliness is sure to imitate what-
ever Beauty does. Farewell ye chignons, there-
fore, and ye gregarines infesting them :
Farewell ye frowsy frisettes, stolen from the
neighing steed Farewell ye pads of alien hair
clipped in Caucasian back slums | Farewell, a
long farewell to more than half your greatness,
ye fashionable heads ! And, O ye monstrous
hairpins, whose huge nobs the hilts of small
swords and of daggers counterfeit, farewell!
The Chignon's occupation’s gone !
Butter in Excelsis.
THE French paper, La Liberté, is given to
that slavish eulogium characteristic of Impe-
rialistic literature. It says that in the Irish
debate, “MR. GLADstone spoke like a states:
man, MR. DISRAELI like a writer in Punch.”
MR. DisrAELI spoke very well, and we have
done and would do all fitting honour to his
reat talent, but the ascription_to him of such
immeasurable superiority over M.R. GLADstone
is fulsome flattery, offensive to gods and men.

She struck a few brilliant chords on the instrument, and then broke
into a Tarantella. - -
“Shall we polk’?” asked the Clergyman, seizing the Lieutenant
round the waist. -
“With pleasure,” was the answer; and, gracefully curving and
bending, they went round the room... .
Oh those happy evenings in Benicia!
“Now for the Contract,” exclaimed GRACE. -
They all seized pens, but before PIEL DoRNTON could affix his sig-
nature a loud report as of a cannonade burst on their ears.
The House divided. -
“Smithereens !” exclaimed one of the three: , The Lieutenant was
the speaker. In another instant the speaker had left the chair. Amidst
confused cries

“Ha!” cried the Lieutenant, as clutching at his niece, they went

FREEDOM.”
CERTAINLY PIELDoRNTON was in luck. The volcanic eruption which
had caused LIEUTENANT MARchmont's house to be raised from the
ground had forced him through the window, whence he fell, the worse
for a few bruises on the velvet lawn in front.
“Fallen on the lawn,” the Clergyman said to himself. “That prº-
mises well for a bishopric in futuro.” He knew Latin and spoke it,
when nobody was listening. -
Marchmont House had disappeared, and with it the Lieutenant and
GRACE, but the contract of marriage was still in PIEL DoRNToN's hand.
PIFL looked cautiously round. He was a bold bad man, but eyen

“That headings be affixed to every chapter, to be chosen by vote.”
*...* The Directors present their respects to the Editor, and wish to know what's
become of the young men who were engaged at an enormous expense to illustrate
this novel. Why, they wan't to know, hasn't there been a picture of any one as yet?
Editor's answer to the above.—All the Artists have sent in pictures of the same
situation, and as each one had taken a different view of the time, place and cha-
racters, it was difficult to select the one exactly illustrating the great sensations in
the foregoing chapters. The Editor, however, does hope that the good feeling, for-
bearance, and gentlemanly tone of all concerned will prevent any contretemps
occurring just as the work is progressing so favourably.
Notes. (a) Thirteen of the Authors were out of town when this was written, and
agreed to leave the description of the voyage, and so forth, in the hands of the
remainder, two of whom professed to have travelled all over the globe, and were
able to vouch for all their localities. These two were under the control of the other
five, among them are two professed naturalists, an archaeologist, a geologist, and a
pisciculturist. Four of them are members of the Acclimatisation Society, and the
two first are Fellows of the Royal Geographical ; at least, so they say.
(b) We, the Directors, think that the above description is too much like the
Child's Noah's ark, but we are loth to interfere with the clear course of the story.
Only do get on.

“to look round than to keep square.
At the thought of his father, DoRNToN paused and mur-
mured, “Still taking it in through the pores. So many
years ago. . How quickly the time has passed.”
His eye fell * the paper in his hand. The sound
awoke him from his reverie.
He walked to his own house, and unlocking a desk
which opened with a spring, he drew from a secret drawer
a small bottle of black ink, a steel pen, a holder, a sheet
of white paper, and an ordinary blotting pad.
Then he lit the fire.
He was º uncertain as to his next proceeding.
He rang the belſ.
A servant in a large mask and a deep sepulchral voice
answered the summons.
DoRNTon asked if º had called, and receiving a
reply in the negative, told the man that he was not to be

as it happened, it entirely escaped his observation.

towards PIEL DoRNTON.
It was midnight before he had finished. -

#. were somewhat afraid to open the low French windows, whence they had
formerly stepped on to the lawn—and they felt the want of air.
But on the second day they discovered three trap-doors in the roof, and the
Boomerang having found a saw, in a short space of time with the aid of a few nails
and a hammer, joined the three traps º so that the whole of one side of the
sloping roof could now be opened and shut at pleasure. -
ortunately the remains of the tea, with muffins, dry toast and butter, were still
upon the table. The Boomerang, who, by the way, had been in their service
for nearly fifteen years, was named NUTT-at least so he had always given then
to understand—now, rose with the occasion, and exhibited a spirit, a determina-
tion, and a knowledge which, though it did not strike them at the time, was far
above any j acquirements of the ordinary Boomerang native.
The Lieutenant sat moping in his arm-chair... GRACE played a little upon what
remained of the piano; but NUTT assumed the directorship, and at once, as a prac-
tical man, portioned out the tea, the dry toast and butter, so as to put them all on
allowance for four days. “His religion,” he said merrily, “taught him charity, and
he always made allowances for everybody.” -
So they ate sparingly three crumbs each of toast, two drops a-piece of tea, and

him back into his seat.
“Sugar !” gasped the wretched man.
* No,” replied NUTT kindly, but firmly, “we must feed equally.” .
“And,” added GRACE, nodding to her Uncle, “as to the sugar, if you do not
like it you must lump it.” - -
They were the first unkind words she had ever spoken to him. She felt it was
necessary, and that upon her resolution now depended their common fate.

MR. PUNCH'S DESIGNS AFTER NATURE.
THIs LITTLE Duck wears AN EFFECTIVE Aquatic JACKET, stroNGLY
REcoMMENDED FOR THE BOATING SEAsoN.
BELOW THE LOWEST DEEP A LOWER DEEP.
THE DUKE OF BRUNswick has lately astonished the audience at the
Bouffes by falling through the bottom of his box into a baignoire
(luckily empty) beneath.
It has been popularly reported that the Duke is too rich ever to
come to the bottom of his strong box; but he evidently can not only
get to, but through the bottom of any box less strong than his own.
We had always heard there was no strength in the Duke's public
case. It seems now that the weakness extends from his public case to
his private box, and that the Duke has accomplished a feat we had
thought impossible, of ºf still lower than he had done already.
Qn his re-appearance, let us hope the band received him with “Hail,
Star of Brunswick!"—said star being invited, it is presumed, to hail,
in consideration of its being prevented from reigning.
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS.
THE EMPEROR has published a Pamphlet, showing that the Napoleons
owe their Imperial position to thirty millions of votes.
MR. HoRN has published a pamphlet showing that the present
Imperial Government, for fifteen years, has cost the country 800 millions
of francs a year more than the Governments which preceded it. In
ºther words, we have NAPOLEoN debtor to France, 30,000,000 of votes,
France creditor to NAPOLE9N, 31,000,000,000 of francs. So that every
vote has cost France 1,033 francs = £41 5s., or thereabouts.
This strikes us as very handsome interest indeed for fifteen years
loan of a Napoleon.
Curiosities of Nomenclature.
We should be careful what names we give to our establishments.
While “The Blackrod Grammar School” (see Commissioners’ Report)
sounds painfully appropriate, “The Mountjoy Convict Dépôt” reads as
dismally incongruous. . (To save future historians confusion, be it
noted that the Usher of the Black rod, &c., is no connection of the
well-known Parliamentary Functionary.)

A stately red Museum stands, a truly noble sight, , .

I let the public enter in, the glorious sights to see :
On Monday, Tuesday, Saturday, I let them enter free,
On Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, they approachin different manner,
Defraying sixpence which they call, if playful-like, a tanner.
The Public is a stupid pig, my girl, and that’s a fact,
They really want an awful deal of telling how to act,
This Show is truly wonderful, if persons only knew, . -
Yet not one Swell in twenty knows the sights as he might view.

It was not so at Hampton Court, which also fusty smelled.
But that’s High Art, at which the Swells as on the painters fawn
Because they are the fashion, when they’re not a looking, yawn;
So come with me, my Susan, to the gorgeous sights down-stairs,
Gold, jewels, silver, ivory, enamel, china wares.
That play we saw the night when you unkindly did behave,
The chap went down burglariously and plundered of a cave.
4laddin were the party's name, and what he saw was fine,
But nothing to the treasures in this Cave of Cole's and mine.
We’ve ransacked every jewel-box for things no price could buy,
We’ve watches, trinkets, amber, pearls, and splendid Bigotry,
The meedy evil relix as I’ve heard from them as knows
Alone would make South Kensington the true A l of shows.
A Trojan’s column, large as life, at least a fairish slice,
Wºº's model of Št. Paul's before he took the King's advice,
And such Italian pulpits, cut and carved to that degree,
I suppose they’d stupid parsons, so required fine things to see.
Old painted coaches and sedans, as like could tell some tales,
As bright as them I see at France, I mean to say Versales,
And lovely music instruments as melts your eyes in tears
To think the ladies they belonged is dead two hundred years.
Which France reminds of purchases that's only just come in,
(I says to Cole, says I, you know the way to frisk the tin) .
We’ve got some crack Art Furniture, as took the highest prize
I never saw such heavenly blue, except in SUSAN's eyes.
Of creature comforts let me speak, of which I can report
Refreshments are provided of the very primest sort.
But O that ass the public, when on our map they read
“Provisional Arrangement” they think that the place to feed.
And now, dear SUE, I’ve toldń. not the half of what I guard,
That Swells don’t come more fluently does seem uncommon hard.
A place like this of mine and CoLE's, at once a Show and School,
The man or woman as don’t see is nothing but a fool.
All the Difference.
GREENBERy, hearing that TRollops was to be made a Pºº.

favourite authors. He was soon undeceived, and laughed at for sº.
posing it possible that Literature in this country should receive *

a Story-Teller, while SIR John may have been a Tory-Teller.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GREAT ZAGAZIAS.
(A Bumpkin Ballad.)
osias GUTCH was GUTCH's name,
Which he took at his christening,
You might yourself ha' heard the
Same,
Had you been there a listening.
Josias had a labouring friend,
Whose name was not Josias,
Though I.A.s. was at its end,
And it was ZACHARIAs.
Jos was a worker in the fields, -
A sort of hedge-and-ditcher-man;
ZAC lived by what the garden yields,
And therefore was a richer man.
Now once upon a holiday
Jos, having no employment,
Thought he would have a jolly day,
Devoted to enjoyment.
And so he sought the market town,
To see the yearly fair there;
And coming home told ZAccHY BRowN
Of all the sights as were there.
“The fust thing as Izeen”—(but, yes,
'Tis here we must announce it,
“Zeen” stands for “Seen,” as every “s”
As “Z” these men pronounce it.)
“The fust thing, Zacchy, as Izeen
Worzomething like a Zircus,
As they'd put up upon the green,
Just oppozite the Work’us.”
“I’ve zeen a Zircus too,” says Zac,
“With horses and young wimmin
As had small clothes upon their back,
Which they lookéd very zlim in.”
Says Jos, “Aye, that t'ain't nout at all,
ur when I got outzide it,
Izeed a pictur on a wall,
And zo Iztopp'd and eyed it.
“Aye, that’s the Jock for me,” says I.
“What was f" asks ZAchARIAs.
“The name writ up,” was his reply–
"Twor the Great Zaga-zias.”
“Great what?” cried ZAc, and scratched
his head.
“I’ll tell you,” says Josias;
“Didn't ye mind, ZAc, what Izaid?
'Twas the Great Zaga-zias.”
“I’ve zeen,” says ZACHARIAs, “too,
Queer beasts as four foot goes on,
But not a Zaga-zias, noo—
At least not as I knows on.”
“It worn’t a tiger, eh?” “Noo, nor
A lion,” says JosLAs.
“It worn’t nout else but what it wor—
"Tworthe Great Zaga-zias.”
“Wor it alive?”, “D'ye think I’d pay
To zee a Zaga-zias
As worn’t alive f Noo, noo, you may
Make zure there, ZACHARIAs.
“Well, I gives tuppuns at the show
Of lions, tigers, lots on 'em ;
And also leppards, which you know,
Be beasts as has great spots on 'em.
“Great bears worlyin' at their ease
Sly lynxeses a watchin',
And : too, and chimpanzees
Continually scratchin’,”
“I’ve zeen all them, the blessed lot,”
Says MusIER ZACHARIAs;
“But what I want to know is what
Be this here Zaga-zias f*
sº Jos, “He worn’t about the show,
hough I looked round and round un,
And if he had been there, you know,
I’d zartin zure ha' # Ull.
“So back I goes right oop to door,
Where I had had to come in,
Just where in front zix men or more
Were trumpetting and drummin'.
“‘My tuppuns 1 wants back,” zays I,
The folksgrinned standing by us, .
‘Cos why?" Zays I, ‘that board do lie,
There bain't no Zaga-zias.”
“‘What not zeen 'im,” zays he to me,
A pointing at the paintin’.
Zays I, ‘that’s what I’ve come to zee,
Zo don't you zay he bain't in.”
“‘He’s in, zays he... Zays I, which be
The way?" Zum zteps wornigh us,
down I went, and in a tent
Zeed the Great Zaga-zias.
“Lor! Zuch a brute, with zuch a fute!
And zuch a mouth, my eyel as
I never zeed, I han’t indeed,
Has the Great Zaga-zias.
“He makes a noise, he grunts and blows
Like wrostlers when they’re grapplin',
great long nose do touch his toes,
And takes a bun and apple in.”
Cries ZAC, “Why mun, I think you can't
Know what you zay, JosLAs;
That beast there wor'an Nellyphant,
And not the Zaga-zias.”
“The Zaga-zias that beast wor,
I tell ye, ZACHARIAs :
I paid my tuppuns, and they swore
twor the Zaga-zias.”
“It wor an Nellyphant,” Zac cries,
“You saw his tusks and trunk too.”
“D’ye think,”, says Jos, “that I tell lies.
D'yethink that I be drunk too.”
“An Nellyphant, ask any one,”
Says laughing Zacharias.
ays angry Jos, “ you zto your fun;
It wor the Zagazias.”
Atlast to ask they did agree
The Parson without bias,
Who went with them himself to see
If 'twas the Zagazias.
The Parson drove’em in his trap,
Drawn by his old mare Margery.
“Woa, lass!” cries Jos," therebethe chap!”
'Twas Wombwell’s Great Menagerie.
“There be the pictur', that’s the one.
Lookoop | "Josias cried, “There !
That be the Zaga-sias, mun,
As they have got inzide there.”
-The Parson said, “You’re wrong, J. G.,
'Tis not the Zaga-zias-
That is an elephant.” “You zee
I’m right,” cries ZAcHARIAs.
*
“If 'tis an el’phant, all the zame,”
Objects the hard Josias.
“Why write above it that there name—
‘Here’s the Great Zaga-zias P.”
The Parson read and stared, then he, .
Turning, exclaims, “Good gracious !
What you make ZAGA-ZLAS, we
Pronounce as thus, SAGAcious.”
“Where’s el’phant writ?” asks Jos Gutch,
warm, -
“The placard isn't ious,
They’ve left it out, and drawn his form
Beneath ‘The GREAT SAgacious.”

Stokes. No, I’m ashamed to say. It’s very stupid of a fellow to sit
mooning at home when there is so much intellectual entertainment to
be had at every playhouse; and not only that, but also at every music-
hall. What an exquisite song that is—“Not for Joseph "
Brad. Capital. ... Really, considering what abundance of recreation
there is for any fellow of decent mind to enjoy if he chooses, one feels
that one ought to make an effort, and dine earlier. It’s too bad to
allow one’s self to prefer a cigar. -
Stokes. Talking of that, here’s something that, once, in the .#
might even entice you from cigars. Then, indeed, possibly it would
make you give up smoking altogether. And it’s likely enough to beat
any play, even of the highly comic order that is now popular.
Brad. What are you talking about?
Stokes. The British Anti-Tobacco Society.
; The Anti British-Tobacco Society you must mean; anti-
Cabbage.
Stokes. No, I don’t. Here it is advertised in the Times—(reads)
BRITISH ANTI-TOBACCO SOCIETY. — A Conference at Exeter
Hall. To-morrow (Saturday) Evening, 21st March, at 7 o’Clock precisely, to
discuss the question, “Is Smoking Injurious?" Rev. Edward White in the Chair.
Supported by DR. EDMUNDs, Robert E. WAINEwRight, Esq., John H. EarERBrooke,
Esq., M.R. Thomas REYNoLDs, and others. Admission free.
There ! . No charge for admission either. The counterblasts of these
British Solomons must be worth hearing.
Brad. British Solomons ! British pumps, British prigs, British
meddling, officious, fussy humbugs!
Stokes. Don't be, angry. . It will be good fun to see these solemn
buffoons, and hear them, seriously, with grave faces, and probably under
violent excitement, declaim in strong language attended with furious
gesticulation. In a scene on the stage they would make the people
roar.
Brad. They make me savage... I hate all these impertinent Societies
with their movements anti this, that, and the other, anti every practi
pleasure, and enjoyment of their neighbours—anti wine, beer, an
spirits, anti Sunday excursions. -
Stokes. You see, by the way, they have got a Committee,
Brad. Hang them, yes! e shall soon get bound hand and foot by
a set of platform agitators—these not anti-humbugs, but the reverse;
humbugs-anti. The next thing will be an anti-beef and mutton, or
anti-butcher's meat agitation by the Vegetarian Asses., We shall have
anti-racing societies, anti-hunting, anti-shooting and fishing, anti-
theatrical, anti-pictorial, anti-poetical—
Stokes. Societies of the Philistines. -
Brad. Brutes' We shall have anti-amusement associations; anti-
billiards, anti-croquet, anti-cards, anti-dancing, perhaps even anti-
football and anti-cricket: , a set of leagues, altogether, anti-social,
including perhaps, ultimately, an anti-matrimonial alliance.
Stokes. Well, you have already the monastic orders. ..
Brad. No, no; the anti-comfort and enjoyment ſanatics of Exeter
Hall have nothing of the monk about them. Publicity is what they
like, not seclusion. Besides, they are specifically British; varieties of
the British Snob. How foreigners must laugh at them, and at us for
giving them any hearing !
Stokes. Well; if we listen to them; we too can laugh at them.
Brad. My good fellow, it’s no laughing matter, when you find these
coxcombs influencing legislation, and actually getting restraints im-
posed on your personal freedom! -
Stokes. There's something in that. But don't grind your teeth.
(Conversation closes.)

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCHPS ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 16. Fourth and last night of what we have been
calling the Irish Debate, but which in presence of certain facts to
mentioned presently, it may be convenient to distinguish as the
MAGUIRE Debate. For it hath a sequel, which, moreover, may be even
more memorable than what led to it.
Even as ROBERT BRUCE (they say) halted his entire army, at an
important crisis, until arrangements could be made for the comfort of
a Scottish matron whom Juno Lucina had visited at that inconvenient
date (of course we don't believe a word of it), Mr. Punch delays his
rush into the ranks of Hibernian battle, while he bestows a favouring
and encouraging smile upon the Younger GLADstoNE, who to-night
made his début, and acquitted himself as one worthy of his sire. His
name being HENRY, we were happy
“To see young HARRY with his beaver off,”
and we wish him many a crowded hour of fight and fray, and all the
honours to be won thereout.
Many men had hit out, GREGORY had remembered his swashing
blow, and BRUEN had given a good hug, when the clock struck ten.
Nicholas NICKLEBY translates a drama in which a bad man hears a
clock strike ten-remembers that he heard a clock strike ten in his
infancy, bursts into tears, and becomes a virtuous character for ever.
We are not aware that anybody burst into tears when the clock struck
on this occasion, but probably more than one person burst into a per-
spiration. For the Chariot of the Hour brought MR. GLADSTONE, and
there was That in his eye which meant business.
It boots not (boot is from the Anglo-Saxon Botan, to profit, and
hence the large profits of bootmakers) to detail the series of blows
which he dealt at the policy and plans of the Government. Had he
stopped after this, nobody would have been much hurt. But he brought
to our mind a former master of Eton, who, having screeched reproof at
an offending lad, added, “I’ve a great mind to flog you.” Then, after
a considerable pause, which gave the culprit much comfort, he would
add, “And I will, too.” MR. GLADstone drew down a tremendous
storm of Opposition cheering by declaring that the time had come for
Dis-Establishing the Irish Church.
[“Dis-establishing,” by the way, is a detestable word, but you must
not say “subverting,” because the Church is supposed to be able to
stand without state aid—why not “divorcing”—for incompatibility of
disposition of revenue PJ
Then MR. GLADSTONE informed the PREMIER that unless his speech,
for which we were looking, materially differed from the speeches of
his colleagues, the Opposition meant not only to ask the Decided
Opinion of the House, but to take a Practical Step.
Then we all looked at the PREMIER.
And he looked at us, as he stood at the table, and waited until the
cheering of MR. GLADSTONE's side, and the answering cheers of his
own men should have ceased.
It boots not to detail his sarcasm, and his counter-attack, in which
he commented upon the conduct of those who demanded that in the
first hours of his Ministry he should deal with a question of 700 years,
a question which they, when in office, had never dared to touch. Here
he made some good play. He had next to say something on behalf of
Religion, and the desirability of connecting it with Government, and
of having a Church to keep Faith steady. He denied that anybody
but dissenters and “philosophers” opposed endowments. But this
was his thunderbolt :
“I deny your moral competence to deal with the Irish Church without
an appeal to the Nation.”
He was for attending to necessary business, and would then cheer-
fully hasten to appeal to the enlarged sympathy of our countrymen,
which fortunately last year's Reform Act had secured.
MR. MAGUIRE withdrew his motion, and the House went into the
interests of Qysters and Mussels. Then it adjourned about two o'clock
in the morning of Saint Patrick's Day. That Saint’s anniversary in
1868 will be remembered.
Tuesday. The Commons had a great wrangle about the constitution
of the tribunal to which Private Bills should be referred, and there was
a division, but we should think that you don’t want to hear anything
about this. DoDson moved something, and then we got into a Fog.
The Anaesthetic Treatment of Church-Rate Bill was considered, as
amended, and mind the last comma but one, as that shows the sense.
MR. BRUCE brought in his Education Bill, and explained it, but it
was not to beB. if the Government scheme, to be set forth to the
Lords by the DUKE or MARLBoRough, were satisfactory. MR. BRUCE
is for Compulsory Education, with Religion, but gives power to a
parent disapproving of the instruction, to take his child away. Whereof
more—and a great deal more—at fitting time.
Wednesday. Previous work having been awfully † to-day we got
at the Liquor., M.R. ABEL SMITH moved the Second Reading of
Bill about Sunday drinking. He proposes that all public-houses shall
|8 to 10 in the evening. No drinking
| to such publicans as desired
be closed on Sunday, except from 12:30 to 2:30, in the day, and from
on the premises.
MR. Locke & that the working men did not need
the legislation in ion. So did MR. LABouchers, who said that it
had been urged the women were in favour of the Bill, the fact
being that it was the woman, in London at least, who drank the most,
and that as soon as the d had laid down the shilling for food,
and gone off to his work, the wife went ofte the public-house to drink
gin with her gossips. his was his fancy sketch, and of course there
was given an answer in thes of another f sketch of crowds of
women standing round their husbands ** gin-shops and begging
for a share of the wages in order to buy food.
MR: GLADstone could not see that we ought to desist from our
crusade * drunkenness, only because it was said to be on the
decline... But he was unwilling to do the working-class good against
their will. He thought well of a proposal for giving a six days’ licence
t
15.
MR. RoeBUCK was very indignant with the Bill, and asked its pro-
moter whether, “when passing by his club on Sunday, he did not turn
in to read Punch and take a glass of Sherry.” We hope he does, as
both are virtuous actions.
MR. HARDY, for Government, would oppose the measure, but would
not oppose full inquiry into the question.
MR. THOMAS HUGHEs supported the Bill, and pointed out that the
club suggestion was not in point, a club being a private house into
which no one could go but the owners, and the artisans were, with his
full approval, forming clubs for themselves. -
There was a good deal more talk, and there was much jeering, on
both sides, at the petitions on the subject, those for the Bill being
signed by women, Sunday-school scholars and the like under the
influence of the clergy, and those against it, by the frequenters of the
public-houses, and under the influence of the publican. Finally
The SPEAKER decided that by reading the Bill a Second Time, the
House affirmed its principle, the Bill was read a Second Time, and sent
to a Select Committee.
Thursday. The Bishop of LoNDON made, as might be expected, a
rational and moderate speech in presenting a petition from some Sena-
tors of Cambridge in reference to throwing open the Universities. The
bishop epigrammatically said that the petition was not numerously
signed, because the prayer did not accord with popular excitement on
either side.
It is pleasant to turn from coarse politics to fine China. A singular
discovery has been made at Bow. Evidence has been detected as to
the manufacture there of English porcelain, and moulds have been
found whence china now at South Kensington is stated to have been
made. The Practical Geologists of Jermyn Street are charged with
the matter, and report that MEssRs. BELL & BLACK, on whose pro-
erty the discovery has been made, evince liberal willingness to make
}; research in the interests of English art. If any goose questions
the ability of our departed potters, we shall henceforth be able to say
Bow to the goose. - - -
LoRD MAYo introduced the Irish Reform Bill. This is the Tory
Radical Reform for Ireland:—
1. No alteration in the county franchise.
2. *::::::: franchise reduced from £8 to £4–adding about 9,000 to
3. Same lodger franchise as in England. -
4. The boroughs of Downpatrick, Dungannon, Bandon, Kinsale, and
Cashel to be disfranchised, and the seats to be given to the
counties, and Portarlington to give up its seat to Dublin.
No Member spoke up against disfranchisement except MR.O'BEIRNE,
Member for Cashel, who protested, remarking that his borough was
larger than many English boroughs which retained their men, and
moreover was a classic borough, for it was the first place that had
returned SIR. Robert PEEL. But the Duke first sat for Trim, and
where is Trim P - - -
MR. GLADSTONE said that there were good principles in the Bill,
but it did not go far enough with Extension.
Friday. A Railway Bill was explained by the Duke of RICHMOND.
One of its features is, compulsory—there is to be communication
between passengers and guard. But it appears by figures that a rail-
way carriage is the safest place in the whole world.
MR. GLADSTONE gave Notice that on the following Monday he would
present the terms of a Resolution on the Irish Church. He hoped the
Government would help him to a night; if not, he should do his best to
take one. ..MR. BRIGHT made an opportunity, in the course of the
evening, of complimenting MR. DiskAELI, on certain postal improve-
ments, and of hoping that if he remained in office long enough, he
would effect some more... Possibly the PREMIER thought he had
enough to do in looking after his own post.
A WoRP to DQMESTICs. A good servant should always be ready to
“answer” the bell or the door, but never a master or mistress.

A FRENCH MORALITY |
IF anybody but Mr. Punch had said what he is going to say, anybody would not
be believed. But from information which Mr. Punch has received through his
own eyes and ears, he is able to make this startling assertion. There is now in
performance at a fondon theatre a Fº taken from the French, in which there is
ardent love, very stirring interest, and a sensation effect, and yet not only is there
no offence, or, suggested offence against morality, but the whole purpose of the
play, is to exhibit high, principle, severely tried, but triumphant. We keep on
reading and re-reading the above lines, they seem so absurd, but we are not writing
in our sleep–Mr. Punch saw the play with his own fine eyes. Go and see the
wonder for yourselves; the piece is called a Hero of Romance, and is performed
at the Haymarket. MR. Sothern has the principal part, plays it with great
finish, and executes a leap in the dark from which Lord DERhy would recoil;
and Miss Robertson, the heroine, is a great deal more than charming. MR.
CoMPTON has walked out of his line into another which he makes his own most
artistically, and the Manager, who has nothing to do, manages, with the aid of an
amazing get-up, to seem everybody. Two º the scenes are admirable paintings
and building up...The play is very attractive, but the Miracle of Morals is what
specially wins for it Mr. Punch's applauding smile. Is Gaul among the prophets?

DAME PARTINGTON AND HER MOP.
(An Orford University Prize Poem, respectfully dedicated to
the signers of a certain Address to a certain Archbishop)
DAME PARTINGTON stood on the shore,
As stern as old woman could be:
And her wonderful mop she bore,
With which to sweep back the sea.
Before her crept up the tide,
Behind her arose the towers
That rise in stately pride
Round Isis’s mystic bowers:
To mask each yawning gap, , ,.
Where the rampart is crumbling down;
On her head was a trencher cap,
On her back was a Master's gown.
Proudly that gown she wore,
As one of her worth aware;
And her mop-handle bore -
“Tests” carved in letters fair.
Now and anon she backed, -
“High and dry,” from reach of the brine,
To save her reticule, packed...
With Articles Thirty-and-Nine,
In the which, as her ballast and stay,
And sheet-anchor she seemed to confide,
As in forcible-feeble way
She apostrophised the tide:
“If it’s coming—let it come,
DAME PARTINGTON is here !
Wild waves might frighten some;
DAME PARTINGTON knows no fear !
“These waves may rise and roar,
And with weaker bars make free;
But e'er they flood this shore,
They’ve to deal with my mop and me !
“Through sand the brine might sop,
But 'tis rock on which I stand :
What I hold looks like a mop,
But it is a magic wand.
“Though Ocean come up like ‘the bore,’”
It comes but to lick my feet—
The swifter its rise, the more
Precipitate its retreat
“I trust to the Articles here,
This impious sea to stop ;
I trust to the walls in my rear,
But most I trust to my mop.
“And if the friends 1 serve,
From the raging and roaring deep,
Their walls wish to §.
They’ll see that this mop I keep !
“For save this mop is nought
That trusted to can be,
'Gainst the wild wave of Free Thought,
And Inquiry's rising sea.
“DAME PARTINGTON is here
At her post to resist the main;
And if saucy waves come near,
To sweep ’em back again
“But rob me of my mop,
And gone is my magic power;
My Articles I drop
or the wild waves to devour.
“My rock is turned to sand ;
My towers and walls decay:
Free Thought is Lord of the land,
And sweeps Altar and Throne away! .
“If your loaves and fishes you’d save,
And crozier and mitre a-top,
Sole barrier against the wave,
Uphold DAME PARTINGTON's mop !”
* The phenomenal tide-wave of the Severn.

MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT OF A BISHOP. WELL! WHY NOT P
THE following statement appears in a newspaper paragraph uncom- Bradford Barracks, Yorkshire,
monly well headed. Note, that the St. Barnabus Church to which it DEAR SIR, March 18, 1868
refers is that of Heaton, near Bradford, Yorkshire, not in Pimlico:-
“On a recent Sunday morning an elderly gentleman, who had been noticed as a
stranger in the congregation, walked into the parsonage of St. Barnabas at the close
of the service, and introduced himself to MR. Mitton as DR. BARING, Bishop of
Durham. He told the young clergyman that he had previously heard of his ability
and worth, and had the pleasure of offering him the living of Bishop's Auckland
(the parish in which the episcopal palace is situate), and which had become vacant
by the appointment of the REv. G. H. WIlkINson to the incumbency of St. Peter's
Church, Westminster. MR. Mitton, full of surprise and thankfulness, accepted
the living, which is worth between £700 and £800 a-year, and will forthwith enter
upon its duties.”
The heading prefixed to this narrative is “REMARKABLE CASE of
CHURCH PREFERMENT.” Capital | A good living given by a bishop,
unsolicited, to a clergyman who is no relation to him, on the pure
ground of personal fitness for its duties, constitutes, indeed, a case of
Church Preferment which cannot but be considered very remarkable.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AWKWARD REMINDERS.
(A Chapter from a New Political Romance.)
“I have been reminded in the course of this debate of expressions which I used
five-and-twenty years ago. I could remind other gentlemen of the expressions they
used on the same subject five-and-twenty years ago; but I do not much care for
that sort of thing.” "
“Not care for that sort of thing?” said Mr. Punch, laying down the
Times, and turning to a volume which lay on his writing-table.
was a punchy small 8vo, with two labels, the upper one inscribed
“D'Israeli's Novels and Tales,” the lower bearing the names of
“Coningsby’’ and “Henrietta Temple.”
Mr. Punch had only lately bought the volume, but he remembered
to have read one of the stories in it when Coningsby first made a
sensation. A quarter of a century had elapsed since then, and the
dashing political novelist had transferred his powers of ingenious con-
struction, fluent utterance, and daring invention, from the library table
to the Treasury Bench of the House of Commons, where he now sat in
the proud position of Prime Minister.
“Not care to be reminded of the expressions he used five-and-twenty
years ago,” repeated Mr. Punch, slowly turning over his Coningsby
“I don't wonder at it. It can hardly be pleasant, with the history of
1866 and 1867 fresh in men's minds, to reminded how, in 1844,
Young BENJAMIN DISRAELI wrote:—
“'The principle of the exclusive constitution of England having been conceded
by the Acts of 1827-8-82,' said CoNINosby, “a party has arisen in the state who
demand that the principle of political liberalism shall consequently be carried to its
extent; which it appears to them is impossible without getting rid of the fragments
of the old constitution that remain. This is the destructive party; a party with dis-
tinct and intelligible principles. They seek a specific for the evils of our social system
in the general suffrage of the population.
“‘They are resisted by another party, who having given up exclusion, would only
embrace as much liberalism as is necessary for the moment; who, without any embarrass-
ing promulgation of principles, wish to keep things as they find them as long as they can :
and then will manage them as they find them as well as they can : but as a party must
have the semblance of principles, they take the names of the things that they have destroyed.
Thus they are devoted to the prerogatives of the Crown, although in truth the
Crown has been stripped of every one of its prerogatives; they affect a great venera-
tion for the constitution in Church and State, though every one knows that the
constitution in Church and State no longer exists; they are ready to stand or fall
with the ‘independence of the Upper House of Parliament," though, in practice,
they are perfectly aware that, with their sanction, “the Upper House' has abdicated
its initiatory functions, and now serves only as a court of review of the legislation of
the House of Commons. Whenever public opinion, which this party never attempts to
form, to ducote, or to lead, falls into some violent perplerity, passion, or caprice, this
party yields without a struggle to the impulse, and, when the storm has past, attempts to
obstruct and obviate the logical and, ultimately, the inevitable results of the very measures
they have themselves originated, or to which they have consented. This is the Conservative
party.
“‘ I care not whether men are called Whigs or Torics, Radicals or Chartists, or by
what nickname a bustling and thoughtless race may designate themselves ; but
these two divisions comprehend at present the English nation.
“‘With regard to the first school, I for one have no faith in the remedial qualities
of a government carried on by a neglected democracy, who, for three centuries, have
received no education. What prospect does it offer us of those high principles of
conduct with which we have fed our imaginations and strengthened our will ? I
perceive none of the elements of government that should secure the happiness of a
people and the greatness of a realm.
“‘But in my opinion, if Democracy be combated only by Conservatism, Demo-
cracy must triumph, and at no distant date. This then, is our position. The man
who enters public life at this epoch has to choose between Political Infidelity and a
Destructine Creed."
“‘This, then,' said MillbANk, ‘is the dilemma to which we are brought by nearly
two centuries of Parliamentary Monarchy and Parliamentary Church 2'
“‘'Tis true,” said CoNINosby. “We cannot conceal it from ourselves, that the
first has made Government detested, and the second Religion disbelieved.’”
The italics are meant to indicate, what it would be hopeless to
attempt in description, the effect which Mr. Punch gave to these words
as he read them. Let the reader imagine all that is most cutting in sar-
casm, pointed in invective, and scathing in contempt, conveyed by the
inflections of the most wonderful of human organs – an organ
ranging from the deepest bass of virtuous indignation to the highest
falsetto of screaming fun—and he will have some faint conception of
the force given to these passages by Mr. Punch's reading.
England listened; and, as the voice of the admirable reader paused
on the concluding sentence, burst into a guffaw that rang from John
o'Groat’s to the land's End, from St. David's Head to Orfordness.
As the laughter died away, Mr. Punch's flexible voice was heard
again,_*Is it indeed the truth that a Parliamentary Monarchy has
made Parliament detested, and a Parliamentary Church has made reli-
gion disbelieved P. Is it not rather clever Humbug and unprincipled
ambition availing themselves of the emergencies of party, and the privi.
leges of a Church, that have worked this feat -
“Pºoyons, HERR SPRUch-speechER.” So saying, he turned from his
Coningsby to his Times, and read, with the same malicious but mas-
terly emphasis, this extract from MR. DiskAELI's latest Defence of
Establishments:—
“If you admit that it is wise to connect the principle of religion with govern-
ment, the mind is naturally brought to endowment. It is the practical mode of
carrying the system into operation. It gives a corporate character to the religious
* See M.R., DishAELI's Speech of Monday, March 16.
principles, which influence men. A Church—an ecclesiastical endowment—a
Church, whatever its character—for when I use the word Church I speak not
only of the Church of this country, or even of the Roman Catholic Church, but of
* body of religious men who have an organisation—such a church steadies faith.
It is a bulwark alike against incredulity and fanaticism, and I do not myself prac-
tically see how such a state of things can be carried on unless you adopt the principle
of endowments. . I should say this particularly with regard to this country, because
the spirit of our legislation of late years has extended into so many subjects—into
education, charity, the reform of criminals, and other matters—which it is utterly
impossible to carry into effect unless the State has at its command the active and
dignified co-operation of a body of men like the clergy, set apart for such noble and
spiritual purposes.”
Again, the guffaw, arose, more irrepressible than before. Punch
waved his ºfton, and all was silence. “You have heard the Strophe,”
he º: “now for the Antistrophe.” And he read from Co-
wings
“The only consequence of the present union of Church and State are, that, on
the side of the State there is perpetual interference in ecclesiastical government, and
on the side of the Church a sedulous avoidance of all those principles on which Alone
Church government can be established, and by the influence of which alone can the
Church of England again become universal."
“There is, I think, a rising feeling in the community, that parliamentary inter-
course in matters ecclesiastical has not tended either to the spiritual or the material
elevation of the humbler orders. Divorce the Church from tho State, and the
spiritual power that struggled against the brute force of the dark ages, against
tyrannical monarchs and barbarous barons, will struggle again in opposition to
influences of a different form, but of a similar tendency; equally selfish, equally
insensible, equally barbarising.”
By this time the feeling of outraged propriety had overborne the
i. of the ludicrous, and there was no laughter from listening Eng-
“What! allamort?” said Mr. Punch. “Be not alarmed. That was
the cockerel's note of twenty-five years since. It is not thus he crows
now, now that, he uplifts his cock-a-doodle-doo from the steeple,
—where he fulfils the appropriate function of weather-cock.” And,
turning once more to the Times, he read:—
“I am in favour of ecclesiastical endowments; I believe they have contributed
greatly to the welfare of this country. I believe they are one of the greatest secu-
rities for civilisation, and I believe that they are beloved on the whole by the
population of both islands.”
“Utrum horum mavis, accipe,” said Mſ. Punch, turning with light
laugh, and ever-ready Latin, to Mother Ecclesia, in the venerable per-
son of the Åroºtstop or CANTERBURY, “BENJAMIN is, indeed, the
Angel of the Church, the ‘Angelical Doctor’ of these Evil Days; but
tell me, Mother, for it is thine to split straws, and take distinctions
between natural and non-natural senses, which reading of the oracle are
we to be guided by ?”
THE EASIEST OF WAYS AND MEANS.

sant. But different quarters are comparatively more or less sensitive;
let, the scourge cut into the less. There is one that should be so
callous as to be incapable of suffering from any fiscal infliction, if truth
inspired the proverb according to which “*::: feels no pain.” Now,
therefore, BENJAMIN, read, and perpend the subjoined statement,
which concerns the work of your situation :-
“ARMoRIAL BEARINos.-The number of persons using armorial bearings is con-
stantly increasing. In the financial year 1855-56 the tax produced in Great Britain
only £53,769; in the year 1865-66 it produced £65,024. A return which has been
issued shows that in this last year the tax was paid by 55,603 persons; 15,077 of
them, being persons keeping four-wheeled, two-horse carriages, paid a tax of
£2 12s. 9d. cach, and the other 40,526 paid 13s. 2d.”
Of course proverbs must be taken with large grains of salt. The
pride that cherishes the “boast of heraldry” is probably not so
entirely devoid of tenderness in the pocket that it would be altogether
senseless of any expense it may be required to sustain; but it can
stand a good deal. You see that it does, in paying the present tax on
Armorial Bearings, which it pays, willingly. Would it not, perhaps,
stand a great deal more? Very likely; and then the question is, how
high you would be able to screw that impost up without making people
disuse the things that render them liable to it—as one would say if
talking of matters concerning parties whom one could presume to
call GARTER, CLARENCIEUx, NoFRoy, & Co.,L-without checking
consumption. - -
However, there is an opposite plan, which might perhaps be success-
fully adopted, for raising the national, wind by the scutcheon-tax:
Everybody in these days can practically have a coat-of-arms if he will
pay for it. Suppose the tax were considerably reduced. Might not
the consequence prove to be a very large increase in the number of its
ayers ? Is there not reason to expect that if you allowed the
}. a reduction, they would more than make up for it by taking
quantity ?
At any rate the tax on Armorial Bearings, as a source of revenue,
has this immense merit that it is optional; and what can be fairer than
that they who choose to bear arms should, at least rather than the
single class of Income-Taxpayers, pay for our battles?

AN EMPIRE IN BANKRUPTCY.
The French empire will, financially, be soon in a nice fix, according
to the balance-sheet which M. HoRN has issued. Assuredly this Horn
makes rather doleful music. Here, by way of a finale, is a sadly mourn-
ful strain:—
“The financial credit of France and her political credit are fallen lower than
before 1852, and her internal condition is characterised by general embarrassment,
which is turning to misery. . . To continue as we are is impossible, and there
remains for France no choice between reform and bankruptcy.” -
Reform and bankruptcy! Scylla and Charybdis' Look either way
he will, the EMPEROR can hardly find much pleasure in the prospect.
What a tempest would arise from the stormy MARSHAL. NIEL, if
reform should take the shape of a reduction of the army How would
M. HAUSMANN rave at a Reform Bill which should clap a stop upon
his organ of destructiveness, and check him in the costly work of
pulling down half Paris' How would the lovely EMPREss pout at a
proposal to reduce her yearly pin-money, and to put her on a limited
allowance of new bonnets! Yet, on the other hand, the EMPERoR
would hardly like to figure in the Court of Bankruptcy. With all his
strong ambition to be likened to his Uncle, he would scarcely wish to
be discovered out at Elba. (Oh!) Will he then do penance in his balance-
sheet, we wonder, and turn over a new leaf in the Imperial account-
book? If he listened to the voice of wisdom, this would be his course:
and if he would gain the ſ. opinion of the world, his first act of reform
should be to lessen, his large army. Let him follow in the "...º.
of his friend, MR. BULL, and the cqurse which he pursues will cease to
be the road to ruin. M. HoRN shows him at present on the horns
of . dilemma, embarrassed by the choice between reform and bank-
ruptcy.

Le Bilan de l'Empire, addressing his fellow freemen, neatly
says:-
“Debt alone sustains us, very nearly in the same manner as the
hanging man is sustained by the cord round his neck.”
Very nearly. This qualification is exquisite. By the
enormous debt which, France has been made to incur by
the maintenance of “bloated armaments” for the glory
of dictating to Italy, and keeping Europe in alarm, she is
not yet quite hung up. But, adroitly suggests M. HoRN,
if she doesn’t mind, she very soon will be.
A Fair Complaint.

M. Horn, in his “sweet remembrancer” of a pamphlet,
Le Bilan de l'Empire, addressing his fellow freemen, neatly
says:-
“Debt alone sustains us, very nearly in the same manner as the
hanging man is sustained by the cord round his neck.”
Very nearly. This qualification is exquisite. By the
enormous debt which France has been made to incur by
the maintenance of “bloated armaments" for the glory
of dictating to Italy, and keeping Europe in alarm, she is
not yet quite hung up. But, adroitly suggests M. HoRN,

relative to GENUINE ARTICLEs, TRUE Conveniences and CoMFORTs,

fact, for grotesque and inartistic illustrations of the superstitious
legends of the Middle Ages. Messrs. SPELTER & Co. trust that by
the acceptance of their proposal to furnish sacred edifices with Pic-
torial Advertising Church Windows, they will be enabled to experience
the gratification of combining Utility, Ornament, Sound Doctrine and
Devotion, with Economy.
I wonder, indeed, but I shall not wonder, if I, shall soon see
churches whose windows are actually glazed with advertisements in
glowing colours. That is what British taste appears to be on its way
to when we behold illuminated posters lining all the approaches to a
lace for the performance of classical music; for instance, the Monday
opular Concert Room at St. James's Hall.

At a meeting of the Aéronautical Society, it has been announced
that a Member, named SPENCER, has flown; and that as soon as he shall
have perfected his wings, will fly the length of the Crystal Palace,

be engaged. This is the first flying Spencer we have heard of since

PIEL DoRNToN walked towards the window. - -
“It is a risk,” he repeated, and pressed the papers which he held in
his two strong hands. - -
* “There are no witnesses; why not?” he said to himself.
Looking upwards he perceived the cradle: and started.
No WITNEsses!
“The child is out late,” he said, frowning. “MRs. Dixon should

He paused.
Should he never be free ?
The southern breeze which had hitherto rocked the cradle forwards
and backwards, was gradually dropping, and in its place was springin

trees, rending rocks, and carrying away men and animals for twenty
miles with irresistible violence. This dreaded breeze is called the

PIEL, DoRNToN gently undid the rope by which the cradle was
suspended. -
he wind blew fiercer. -
Piel, DoRNton rang the bell. “Tell MRs. Dixon I wish to see her.”
With a heavy crash the cradle fell. - -
In a minute the frantic mother was kneeling by the side of her infant.
“Who has done this f" she exclaimed.
PIEL DoRNToN passed down the garden, on his way from the house.
“My dear MRs. Dixon,” he said, in his softest tones; “you left
your baby on the top of the tree.” She paused and pressed her brow.
He continued, quietly, “When the southern wind blows, the cradle is
rocked, I know; but when that wind drops, and the Azuwos arises,
the cradle, MRs. Dixon, will fall, then down must inevitably come the
crºlle, the baby—”
She was kneeling on the grass, with her baby clasped in her arms,
and both hands stretched high above her head towards the starry sky.
PIEL DoRNton, papers in hand, pºssed on.
“ MARY Dixon,” he muttered, “You mean mischief.”
But for the present, the WILL.
Turning the corner he entered the bank of MEssRs. CHEKK, Diss,
Count, & Co., the great Benicia Agents.
What was he doing there *
CHAPTER XII.
IN BANCO.
THE Clerks received him.
“We were just, closing,” said old grey-headed MR, SNAGG, the
Senior Cashier; “but pray walk in, MR. DoRNToN. What can we do
for you, Sir P’. -
...Cash this,” replied, PIEL DoRNTON, presenting a cheque for two
million six hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds.
"Will you have it now,” inquired MR. CHEKK, “ or wait until it is
given to you?”
PIEL DoRNTQN preferred the former alternative. “I shall also
require money for this,” he added, presenting a formidable-looking
document. -
“The signature is a good one,” said MR. SNAGG, smiling, “I don't
think there'll be much difficulty about that. I will just make a memo-
randum of the transaction.” -
So saying the methodical old man drew out a neatly-bound ledger
and made the following entry:—
“Paid to the Rev. PIELDoRNTon on account of LIEUTENANT CHARLEs
AUGUSTUS LEONARD MARCHMONT's cheques to said account, and also on
account ºf the aforesaid CHARLEs Augustus LEoNARD MARCHMONT's
last will and testament, the sum of three million sterling, allowing the
present price of Benician stock and discounting the same at 93$.”
Here followed the date and the signatures for himself and the Partners,
And so PIEL DoRNToN went back to his house the acknowledged
HeiR of the late CHARLEs Augustus LeoNARD MARCHMONT.
fºr The Directors (to the Editor) express themselves much pleased with the first
illustration to the interesting novel, Chikkin Hazard. They do not profess to know
much of drawing, but isn't the house a little out of perspective : [Being bound by
--
the rules of the Novel Company to communicate with the Artist, and receive and
publish both letter and reply, the Editor has pleasure in announcing that he
has received the following from the Artist. Ed.
“Dear Eddy, -I will not be interfered with : if I am to draw at all, it must be
with a free pencil. I'm glad the Directors like the picture, but if I am to do every-
thing in perspective, why you must give me more space. Hang it, you give the
Authors five times (I've measured it) as much room as you do me. Why shouldn't
one number be only a picture ; extra work, of course, requiring an extra honny-
raryum. I don't know if this is the word, but in English I mean pº Yours, &c.,

From the Authors.-The majority of the Authors have decided that the ta-
tion of the Boomerang is a mistake. A small minority (who dined with the Artist
the night before—we've found that out) say it's excellent. You, as Editor, should
tell the young gentleman that he must keep to our plan, or you'll get somebody else.
Note in haste from the Artist.—“Either my representation of the Boomerang, is the
one or not. If not, I won't do any more. why should I go on drawing up to the
Authors' ideas? I can't undraw the thing : I can withdraw though- will. Let
them make their confounded Boomerang suit mine—Yours, The Artist.”
Note by the Editor.—The Boomerang turns out to be in disguise. #:
say more at present. * * * Since writing the above the Editor is happy to thform
the Directors that a compromise upon most equitable terms has been effected.
The recent illustration will be taken to represent the disguise, from which in future
pictures the Boomerang will gradually emerge. And the Editor does hope that the
good feeling, forbearance, and gentlemanly tone of all concerned will prevent any
contretemps occurring just as the work is progressing so favourably.
From Directors to Editor.—Why don't you publish opinions of the Press Puff it
Sir, puff it.
Editor to the Directors.—The Press hasn't expressed any opinions. Don't tell me
to puff it—you can puff it yourselves. I know my work. -
The Editor begs to state he has received numerous offensive letters from the
shareholders. It is not in accordance with the rules to publish them. Let all
offensive communications be addressed in future to the Directors.
MORE FROM OUR ARTIST.
S To the Editor of “Chikkin Hazard.”
IR,-
. The drawing sent herewith requires, some little explanations.
This morning, at 10:30 A.M., I had prepared everything necessary for
the illustration of Part IV., which Part i expected to receive in manu.
script at 1035, according to promise. My models (male and female,
including the individual whom I have engaged to sit for the Boome-
rang), my Reader, who deciphers MSS., and selects the subject, my
‘Aye, PIEl DoRNton,” interrupted the woman, savagely, “AND ALL.”
Instructor in Navigation, my Tropical Ornithologist, and Entomo-
logist, and the gentleman from Kew, who has kindly undertaken to
coach me in the Benician Flora, were all waiting in my studio to help
me in the execution of the required woodcut.
11 o’Clock struck; no MS, but a telegram from one of the gentle-
men connected with the Letter-press of Chikkin Hazard, and suggesting
a subject.] I went to work immediately with all my staff. At 11:35
(just as I had finished the illustration) another telegram from another
gentleman, which rendered a totally different composition indispens-
adle.
I went to work once more. At 11:46 12", another Telegram / and so
on till 2 P.M.
I then made up my mind to choose my own subject; and that none
should feel aggrieved, I have ventured to select for illustration an in-
cident, which inay possibly not be described in the Letter-press, but
which nevertheless must force itself on the mind of the reflective
reader; namely, GRACE’s toilet on the roof of the ark.
I have endeavoured to show how, through the 'discretion and inge-
nuity of the Boomerang, GRACE is enabled to perform her ablutions,
and put on her back hair as privately as if she were in the seclusion of
her own Benician bower.
Trusting that the difficulties I had to labour under will prove a
sufficient excuse for the liberty I have taken in thus acting on my own
responsibility,
I remain, Sir, faithfully yours,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
HABET |
l. That the Established Church of Ireland should cease to exist as
an establishment, due regard being had to personal interests.
2. That it is expedient to prevent the creation of new interests.
3. THAT the QUEEN be asked to hand over to Parliament her interest
in the temporalities of the Irish sees and other dignities.
That is the triple cord with which, MR. GLADstone stood up, on
Monday, March 23rd (dies notanda, colour chalk to your taste), and
proposed to execute the Irish Church.
MR. DisRAELI, counsel for the Irish Church, Religion generally,
Faith, the Altar and the Throne, and the Angels, procured stay of
execution until the following Monday.
F. He next day wrote a letter to the Dartmouth Union (not the work-
house of that delightful place, but a Society calling itself “National,”
of which LoRD DARTMOUTH is Chairman), and said that “we had heard
something lately of the crisis of Ireland.” In his opinion
The Crisis of England is at hand/
“For the purpose is avowed, by a powerful party, of destroying that
Sacred Union between Church and State which has hitherto been the
ºn. of our civilisation, and is the only security for our religious
erty.
Ere these lines reach the eyes of the Universe, Mr. Punch will have
remarked, in a mild and Shakspearian manner,
“Now they are clapper-clawing one another.”
Of course this is the beginning of the fiercest and most important
fray which it has been his duty to record, and he feels impressed
accordingly. But it is somewhat inconvenient to be always in hys-
terics. Moreover, although his convictions upon the propriety and
expediency of removing the lish Church are graven with a pen of
diamond upon a tablet of adamant—diamond cutting diamond—he begs
leave to refer the pensive public to his Cartoon for what he will venture
to call, in cookery-book language, “the Same Another Way.” There
will be plenty of sesquipedalianism without his aid. Nevertheless, he
knows how to do the big bow-wow at the proper time.
. In the Lords, the CHANCELLOR explained his new Bankruptcy Bill.
No person who reads Punch, and acts up to his teaching, can ever be in
tºniº difficulties, but the heathen may be interested in knowing
Imprisonment for debt is abolished.
But if, after judgment, Snip the tailor thinks you are bolting to

Only in open County Court is a man to be committed, and by the

man because a scoundrel tally-man has duped the wife into taking
credit for trash.
But the County Court may arrest a Quarter of a debtor's
earnings.
You may not make yourself a bankrupt, as now.
But you may, after twenty-one days after your advertisement that
you can't pay anybody, no creditor interfering.
Scotch system of Trusts in Bankruptcy to be tried; that is, credi-
tors choose any trustee they like to assist in the winding-up,
and they may have inspectors over him.
No suspension of final discharge for more than three years.
After-acquired property to be available for creditors, after proper
maintenance for family, and paying later debts.
County Courts to be the Bankruptcy Courts; but for London and
twenty miles round, a Tribunal, which shall also have appellate
jurisdiction over all bankruptcy.
The Law Lords discussed. Lond WesTBURY was strong for a big
Qhief Judge; Lond CHELMSFORD approved his successor's Bill; LoRi,
RomLLLY advocated the cheap and simple way in which the estates of
| the dead are sorted in Chancery (clear your mind of cant; old Chan-
cery jokes are gone by), and the Bill was read a Second Time.
“Time,” says SHAKspEARE, “is a Bankerout, and owes more than
he is worth,” so we hasten on to remark that (after the awful Irish
notice) SIRJ9HN PAKINGTON moved the Army Estimates. He wants
Fourteen Millions of money, 138,691 men, says that recruiting has
greatly improved, (it will improve still more, we hope, now that MR.
OTWAY, whom we heartily congratulate, has carried his resolution
against Flogging in the Army,) and that the Enfields are nearly all
converted into Sniders. We hope that the Militaire will repay to
SNIDER the love that SchNEIDER has for the Militaire. This allusion
will puzzle posterity. Let posterity be puzzled. It will be, many a
#. and oft. For instance, what does ToM Hood, the elder, mean by
“Burn the Breeks of meddling vicars
Picking holes in ANNA's Urns”?
* Does posterity know that a vicar of the name of BREEks insisted on
facing a monument erected by a widow whose Christian name was
ANNAP Shall it know that a very fast songstress in Paris has made a
sensation by singing "J'aime le militaire’?
Tuesday. The DUKE of MARLBorough introduced the grand Go-
.." measure on Education. It has one very good feature,
namely,
THERE IS TO BE A MINISTER OF EDUCATION.
The rest of the Bill is mild enough. There are to be grants for
secular schools, but there is nothing compulsory about the measure.
The Duke again administered his anodyne—we are not so far behind
other nations. ... But, Duke, we are. ou argue from sloppy and
generalised statistics, against sound ones, and it is of no use prophe-
sying smooth things to please the parsons... We ought to be ahead of
l nations, instead of living in a fool's Paradise. However, the Minis-
ter is a gain, and once we get him, we’ll work him.
The Commons discussed Licences to trade, and no doubt grievances
are to be proved. But we can't relieve piece-meal. MR. GLADstone
never loses a chance of letting the Publican know what the ex and
future.C. of X thinks of him. “Out of the seller of spirits, and Qut of
what he sells,” said MR. GLADSTONE, “it is our accepted conviction
that we ought to get as much as we can.”. Which words will bear
fruit in their season. Fine spirits are not finely touched but to fine
issues, and we know who º touch up fine spirits by the issue of
licences with fines.
MR. GLADstone's Bill for the Gentle Slaying of the Church Rate
came in for its last stage, and after a feeble attempt to get adjournment,
numbers 131 to 28, the Bill was read a Third Time, and passed with
cheering. It is to be hoped that the PREMIER has signified to the
Peers that the measure must be accepted, or the next will be worse.
The child's rhyme indicates what the present Bill is, and what the
future may be:—
“Here comes a Candle to light you to bed,
And here comes a Chopper to chop off your head.”
Wednesday. Perfectly dull, except that MR. BEResford Hope
brought in a Bill about TANCRED's Charity. This TANGREP is not the
hero of TAsso, or of MR. DisBAELI, but was a pig-headed old York-
shireman of the last century, who left his property in what is called a
charitable and Bounderby *. Without, detailing the old donkey's
caprices, except that two of them provided that deer should be kept
up, and women excluded from his place, it may be mentioned that the
Charity Commissioners propose to upset most of his nonsense; and
that this Bill, which was to perpetuate some of it, was thrown out.
“Ed, oime, grida, e qui TANCREDI ucciso.”
Thursday. On the motion of EARL STANHOPE, a Committee was ap-
pointed to inquire into the working of the Ecclesiastical,Titles Act, ,
the Act (it may be necessary to inform the post nati) which was typified
by Mr. Punch in the immortal Cartoon of LoRD JoHN RUSSELL who
wrote “No Popery” on CARDINAL WisemAN’s door, and then ran
away. It was a Protest, however; and now Protest-ants can, afford
not only not to mind whether the Pope calls, a clergyman Bishop of
Holborn or Bishop of Hippopotamus, but to be glad, that any effort is
made in behalf of any respectable sect of Christian religionists,
A Vote for Volunteers, not nearly liberal enough, was taken, and
there was a debate on the Bribery Bill, which went a little way...Then
came the Mutiny Bill, and MR. DARBY GRIFFITHs, hindering it, was
told by Colonel, STUART Knox that he was talking nonsense, and on
making a lumbering sort of remonstrance was ordered by the SPEAKER
to confine himself to the question, MR. Otway—we are happy to
repeat it, carried by 152 to 127—his motion against administering to
soldiers the punishment which should be reserved, for, , and most
lavishly bestowed upon ruffians who commit crimes with violence.
“Descend, ye Nine, descend and sing,
Till soldiers' cheeks with triumph flush :
Descend, ye Nine, descend and sting,
Till ruffians' hides shall redder blush."
Friday. EARL Russell, afraid that England and America, are
growing too affectionate, did what he could, by a recapitulation of his
own mistakes during the Rebellion, to cool down the feelings of the
former, and bring her back into an attitude of “proper pride.” But the
chill fastened upon his own amiable endeavour. ---
Miscellaneous talk—clever speech by MR. GREGORY on the British
Museum, good one by MR. DisBAELI, who has a Bill º for the
Extrusion of the Beasts—debate on ..". Pilotage : the ship-

a storm of wrath, but if the affair of the Cocks is a battle for place, all is fair in
war, and if an affair of principle, and the House is in earnest DisRAELI might

The numerous Sabbatarian readers of Punch will rejoice greatly in perusing the
subjoined glad tidings:-
“FINED For SELLING Fish on A SUNDAY..—At the Bull Police Court, on Tuesday, a fish-
hawker was summoned on the information of a police constable for having sold some plaice on
a Sunday, morning. The officer said he saw the defendant sell the fish on the east side of the
Humber dock basin. Defendant admitted that he had sold sixpennyworth of plaice, but he was
a poor man, and did not know that he had done any more wrong than a smack-owner who had
sold his £10 worth of fish. Defendant was fined 5s. and costs."
A fine of five shillings may seem a slight punishment for the crime of selling fish
on a Sunday. But perhaps the criminal convicted of that enormity at Hull could

thought that he had a week's low diet and hard labour in the House of Correction.
. It is satisfactory to see, as in this instance, Sabbatarianism vindicated pure and
simple. When a tradesman is fined for keeping his shop open on a Sunday, it
may be said that he is punished principally for an offence committed against other
people, the assistants, or servants whom he deprives of their lawful rest. But
the penalty imposed on a hawker, for desecrating the Sabbath by labouring in hi
yocation, is punishment, inflicted simply, and solely for the offence against the
Sabbatarian religion. The hawker islgunished for nothing more than desecrating
the Sabbath personally, by himself. This is religious liberty—the liberty to enforce
religious observance.

AN “OFFICIAL ENGLISH?” DICTIONARY WANTED.
THE art of calling a spade a spade seems sadly out of fashion with
our Pogr:Law Inspectors...Instead of swallowing their squeamishness,
and speaking in plain English, and telling us plain truths, they use fine
official language to veil, in some degree the horrors they discover, and
which it is their duty plainly to disclose. Their official English teems
with euphuistic epithets, which no unofficial dictionary can help us to
translate. . For instance, who could guess that “insufficient” and
ºt º ” meant half what is ascribed to them by MR. ERNEst
HART P—
“‘Inadequate” and “insufficient' stood for the evils which had been exposed in
connection with the Bedminster Union, the scrubbing of black gangrened hands in
mistake for dirt, the holding a patient's hand against a place hot enough to ignite a
match, and a number of other cruelties, only prevented from being inquired into
by the resignation of the master and principal officers, and to his (MR. HART's)
mind the Poor-Law Board too often connived at the quashing of an inquiry, which,
although it might cause a scandal, would show where the weak points were. But
if there were no official inquiries the accidental inquests brought to light the evils.
Quite lately inquests had been held on paupers ‘done to death’ in provincial work-
houses, and one showed how a child was killed by being placed in scalding water,
and then having the blisters rubbed off with a towel. These were some of the facts
which would help the Poor-Law Board to a translation of the words “inadequate"
and “insufficient' in their inspectors' reports."
Or who, without the help of MR. HART's translation, could have
imagined that fine phrases, like those he further mentions, veiled such
terribly foul facts P-
*Thus, “want of classification” meant that people with bronchitis were put in
beds with people with the itch, as at Bury Union; it meant the aggravation of the
sufferings of the sick, in short, by neglect of the most cruel and indescribable
character; "insufficient attendance" meant no labelling of bottles, neglect of giving
to the sick their proper diets or at the proper times, leaving the sick to their own
help or no help at all, the mixing of the convalescent sick who needed rest and
quiet with the noisy lunatic.”
As language was invented to conceal our, real, thoughts, so fine
official language has likewise been invented to hide the real facts. But

far better sicken people by telling' them plain truths, than gloss over
evil doings which are sure to bear ill fruit. Clearly our Inspectors, if
they are to be of use to us, must learn to write in language which we
can understand. Otherwise, the Poor. Law. Board must issue a new
phrase-book, in which, “official English” will be put into plain

PADDY'S NEW PICTURE-BOOK.
'Twas a sight Saxon eyes to bewilder
JoHN BULL saw through PAT's º,
PAT, enjoying a pipe with the “childther”
Round his knees clustered close on the floor.
The boys, with their keen Celtic faces,
The girls, with their sweet Celtic eyes,
And lithe limbs, whose natural graces
Defied tattered linsey and frieze.
By the hearth sat the wife at her stocking,
With her needles in rythmical play,
While her foot kept the rude cradle rocking,
Where a rosy young Celtikin lay.
From the brown hearth the turf-reek ascended
With the blue curls of Paddy's dadeen,
And cool light, and warm shadow were blended
On the prettiest group ever seen.
PAT was busy, but not upon treason—
Nor pike nor revolver was there—
With a wide-open volume his knees on,
Whose title John read, printed fair:
“Irish history—People's edition—
Eighteen sixty-eight—volume two "–
Volume one, all of wrong and sedition,
On the hearth, burnt to ash, smouldered blue.
Round the new volume, cheap, but clear-lettered,
The children pressed close to his knee,
And the father's slow spelling was bettered
By his babes, 'cuter scholars than he.
He might trip in his moods and his tenses
But the import they caught in the rough ;
For those bright Celtic wits and keen senses
E’en half-uttered words were enough.
But the pictures Ah, there was the glory
Of the book, to old listeners and young !
'Twas they gave a point to the story,
And a glow, in advance of it, flung,
That lit the dark cabin with splendºr,
Like the outburst of sun after rain,
Till from hard the old faces waxed tender,
And the young more of youth seemed to gain,
For frontispiece, England and Erin
Crowned with shamrock and oak seemed to stand:
With Justice her sheathèd sword bearing,
And her scales, even-poised, in her hand.
And facing this picture of union,
The Heir of the Grown of the Isles,
hile Erin, in loyal communion
Of creed and class, brought him her smiles.
A page further on, 'twas a prison
Where law-breakers sat, but the sun,
The great sun of Justice, new-risen, , .
Had blent “green” and “orange” in one.
By an Irish-American plotter,
A Downshire grandmaster I saw—
And Ascendency's pillars a-totter
By the firmly-based columns of law
And the same sun of Justice whose beaming
No foul party colours could smirch,
A few pages further, its gleaming
Had spread from the Cell to the Church.
And in its fair radiance were clustered,
"Unbindered, the Protestant few,
While the Catholic myriads mustered,
To receive, not their dole, but their due.
No longer sly slave and hard master,
iike lions with lambkins at play,
Walked Popish and Protestant pastor
And worshipper, each his own way,
And there Irish landlord and tenant,
"By fair-dealing no longer foes,
One grown honest, the other turned clement,
Made the waste places bloom like the rose.
For that new light of Justice in Heaven,
Was ºf. strange light on earth,
As with new peace new plenty was given,
Where lately reigned hatred and dearth.
These things in the new Irish history
That PAT showed his children, John saw ;
A morality 'twas—not a mystery-
And John shouted ERIN-Go-BRAGH !

AN EXPLOIT IN ABYSSINIA.
(By a Special Correspondent.)
The personal prowess of our countrymen is very remarkable. It is
wonderfully exemplified in the exploits which, when occasion takes
them to India and other partially civilised or uncivilised countries, they
are wont to *..." upon the natives. In particular, they are uncom:
monly good hands at kicking, those who offend them... You may call
this an Irishism. Never mind. Thinking of that, reminds us to say
that, amongst those countrymen of ours who are especially wont to
astonish the natives by the feats of the foot abovenamed, we by no
means intend not, to include, but, on the contrary, do somewhat
expressly class Irishmen. It would not at all surprise us to learn that
the following narrative was penned by a hand, of which, in national
parlance, it might be said that the natural weapon is the shillelagh:—
“Before leaving Ad Abagha we had rather an amusing episode with the natives,
which might, however, have proved costly. Being averse to start at so early an
hour as soven o'clock, we did not strike our tents till after the troops had left, and
were left alone in our glory on the top of the hill. A crowd of the Aborigines, on
plundering bent, rapidly collected, and the eyes of an Argus, and the hands of a
Briareus were required to protect our numerous chattels. All at once I perceived a
dusky individual sloping off with a bridle. I gave chase, and overtook the thief.
Now, my stature is diminutive, and my physique anything but formidable, but,
like MR. JAGGERs's clerk, I have the greatest regard for portable property, and
unlike Othello, I deny that “he who steals my purse, steals trash." Moreover, my
blood was up at the audacious theft, so I made a furious onslaught on my stalwart
but fortunately unresisting adversary, and kicked him from top to bottom of the
hill with the greatest gusto."
The hero of the adventure above related is a gentleman attached to
the Abyssinian Expedition, and connected with the London Press.
His entire letter impinges on the mind's ear with a Hibernian reso-
nance, especially notable in the quotation, first of Iago's words as those
of Othello, and next in assigning a dissent from the valuation of a purse

But what to me most strange appears
Is, whether Whig or Tory,
He mostly reaps but scoffs and sneers,
Instead o' praise and glory.

expressed in them as a reason for objecting to being robbed of a bridle,
As an illustration, however, of the alacrity at kicking, characteristic of

splendid, No matter how stalwart and gigantic the native may be

FASHIONABLE MODESTY.
CoNsideking the follies which are put forth in Le Follet, we rarely
find much pleasure in the news which comes from Paris in the matter
of the fashions. Here, however, is a statement which most thoroughly
delights us:—
“The dress is not worn so low as last year, either on the back or front.”
It sadly lowers one's opinion of the sense of the fair sex to consider
that, with many women, modesty is nowadays a matter of mere fashion.
For many a month past dresses have been worn so low as barely to be
decent. , Ladies who of late have been modestly attired, could lay no
claim whatever to being in the fashion. Decency, however, is once
more to be the mode, and, as few ladies have the courage to disobey
their dressmakers, we may hope that for a while, until the fashion
changes, we may be able tº dinº out, and even go to dances, without
blushing for our partners.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[APRIL 11, 1868.
STUDY IN A HIGH WIND.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 30. Mr. Punch cites, with pleasure, a charming
passage from the PREMIER's brilliant novel, the Young Duke:-
“Ah, that terrible House of Lords,” said MAY DACRE. “Scarcely forty-eight
hours and all will be over, and we [Catholics] shall be just where we were. You
º: 3. friends manage very badly in your House,” she said, addressing herself to
e iduke.
“I do all I can,” said his Grace, smiling; “BURLINGton has my proxy.”
“That is exactly what I complain of. On such an occasion, there should be no
proxies. Personal attendance would imply a keener interest in the result. Ah, if
I were Duke of St. James for one night !”
-
, if you would be Duchess of St. James 1" thought the Duke, but a despairing
lover has no heart for jokes.
His Grace did better than joke. He hurried off to London, got into
the House of Lords in time, delivered a fresh and effective speech for
Catholic Emancipation, hastened back to overhear the lovely May
Dacre delightedly reading it to her father, and the next time the Duke
and May— But get the book: it is full of dash, wit, and “go.”
Why Mr. Punch quoted it is that dear May Dacre's reform has come
about, and that early in the week, the Privy Seal to the author of the
Young Duke carried a standing order which practically does away with
proxles.
The CoMMANDER-IN-CHIEF did not see his way to opposing the
Mutiny Bill as altered to prevent Flogging, but his Royal Highness
hoped that consideration would be given to the question of military
punishment. It was necessary, we suppose, that some such speech
should be made; but Mr. Punch, who is not good at seeing red-tape
difficulties, cannot perceive reason why the Duke, and GENERAL
FonstER, and the Horse-Guards, should be in any fix. Surely, in
peace time, there are fifty practicable punishments, exclusive of a cruel
one, and in war time nobody proposes to take away any power neces-
sary to a General:—
“For Britons rarely swerve
From discipline, however stern, that serves their force to nerve.”
Childe Harold.
n Merely mentioning that on Wednesday, the CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExchequER has brought in the Bill enabling Government to Acquire
the Telegraphs, Mr. Punch proceeds to the Great Irish Church Debate,
which occupied the Four Nights.
Monday. Before the º a farce. Certain Tories demanded the
reading of part of the Act of Union with Ireland, and the Coronation Oath.
The gentlemen meant that MR. GLADSTONE was about to ask Par-
liament to violate law, and the QUEEN to commit perjury. The farce
was not very well received by the audience.
GLADsTONE moved his Anti-Irish Church Resolutions. He
spoke very moderately, declared his own consistency, urged that the
time had come, and dwelt tenderly with the rights, real or possible, of
all persons in any way interested in the Church. Let us build up
TO CHIEF RABBI ADLER.
MR. Punch reads in that excellent paper, the
Jewish Chronicle and Hebrew Observer, that at
Liverpool the new Hebrew congregation wants-
AN ASSISTANT SHOCHET AND PORGER.
Mr. Punch has on hand an assortment of
young men of the EARL Russell type, prepared
at a moment's notice to undertake anything,
from taxidermy to seismography, and many of
them are pteridophilists, but none of them knows
what a shochet and porger is. ill the
admirable Chief RABBI ÁDLER clear our addled
wits f And while about it, will he tell us
whether it is really true that many rich Jews
|scarcely contribute to the fund of the Board of
Guardians of Hebrew Poor, an institution which
enables the Jews to avoid all the scandal which
we, and ERNEST HART, and LoRD Devon, and
some others are trying to do away in the case of
the Christians? r. Punch makes no apology
for interfering, everything is his province, as it
was BAcon's (with apology for mentioning such
a name) and he is particularly anxious for
answers to both questions.

MR. O'RBILLY. If Ireland cannot look to England for justice, she
will look to the West for Revolution. ---
MR. SHREIBER. Stand by the Church, or troubles and calamities
are coming. -
CAPTAIN.WHITE (a very good maiden speech). Let us do justice,
whether injustice be to our advantage or not. Irish Protestantism
had suffered from over-pampering.
The Irish ATTORNEY GENERAL, said what a clever, energetic lawyer
could say for his client the Church, and her rights.
MR. BRIGHT, smiling at legal cobwebs, humorously arrayed the
varying utterances of Ministers, and ridiculed the calling that a revolu-
tion which affected only a tenth of a country. The Church was a
failure, and its demolition was asked by a Protestant minority in Ire:
land, by all the Catholics, and by general consent in England and
Scotland. Remember how well other denounced measures have
worked. Do not play the game of the Fenians. One of his best
natured speeches.
Thursday. MR. Roebuck would support M.R. GLADSTONE-hating
all Establishments. Don't talk to me about, sacredness; no human
interest is sacred. But mind, if this is only a trick to oust MR.
DISRAELI. As to other considerations, I am an Imperial Englishman,
and the Catholics are hostile to our rule. No sentimental talk about
oppression shall prevent my maintaining Imperial rule.
HENLEY, of course opposing, spoke so much in the style of the
old days when an illustration was not held to be objectionable because
it was a little full-flavoured, that we must only say that the gallant old
Tory uttered his mind, and protested against breaking a treaty made §

the present lot. Will he be one?

MR. GLADSTONE's private secretary, to talk Gathorne Hardily.

EARL QF MAyo. That is the talk of thirty-four years ago. Volum-

MR. DISRAELI (who spoke for two and a half hours). This House,
as LoRD PALMERSTON's manifesto showed, was not elected to decide
the Irish Church question. We ought not to be asked, at eight days'
notice, to repeal the Union. , I denºunce this vast and violent change
proposed. It violates the rights of property. And where, if you sepa-
rate religion from Government, will yºu stop? Are we to recognise
the Pantheistic principle f MR. GLADsºone represented Ritualism and
Popery. That combination had superhuman power; but, while the
QUEEN allows me to stand here, I will fight it.

imagination. It is ultra-democratic, if nºt anarchic, to say that Par-
liament cannot act without appeal to the éonstituencies. Each of the
Establishments must stand on its own merits. It is too late to endow
the Catholic Church, MR. DISRAELI wants to set up the Pantheism
he deprecates. Let Parliament show its sincerity, and clear the ground

THE SNOB-WANDAL.
THE venerable MARQUIs of LANsDownB, at once Nestor of our party:
fights, and Mecaenas of our arts, in the last days of his life bestowed
a drinking fountain on Berkeley Square. After his usual gracious and
princely fashion, the good old Lord went for his design to a sculptor,
not a stone-mason, and, also after his fashion, to a young sculptor, one
of the most graceful and tasteful of the rising generation of artists in
clay and marble, ALEXANDER MUNRo. In due time the sculptor
modelled and carved a fair nymph, from whose uplifted urn poured a
stream of clear water for the passers-by who liked to drink. The
statue was at once a beautiful decoration of a place where beauty, in
marble at least, is rare—a London Square, an honour to its sculptor,
and a seemly memorial of the kindly and cultivated old nobleman, who
had given it to the neighbourhood. And now some snob has defaced
the poor nymph of Berkeley Square by knocking off her nose !
Is there any capital of Europe in which such an outrage could have
been perpetrated, except indeed for a lark, by some rowing, roving
Englishman P - -
These are the things that make sensitive, and cultivated Britons
blush for their country, and bear out what Mr. Punch has insisted on
more at length in, another article this week, that we have amongst us
an element of coarse, stupid, brutal insensibility to the beautiful in
art and nature, feeling and conduct, which is as rife in “upper” as in
“lower” classes, and can display itself comfortably, indeed is rather at
home than not, along with what is conventionally called good breed-
ing, good society, and good manners. Whatever we may think of the

How we DRIVE IN ABYssinia.
THE Pall Mall Gazette, which, among all its useful functions, exer-
cises none more useful than that of Inspector-General of Administra-
tive Departments, especially the Poor-Law Board, the Horse-Guards,
and the Foreign Office, prints, in its number for March 26, a story
which ought to be repeated till it is contradicted; or, if it cannot be
contradicted, till those who are chargeable with the amazing stupidity
andº: it discloses, are exposed, and, if possible, punished. Here
is the story:—
“The Turkish and Egyptian mule-drivers, engaged for the transport service of
the expedition, on joining, were placed under officers who did not know their lan-
guage. In the confusion of starting an expedition like this, they were left some days
without food or water. They maturally did not like it, and were ºf: daily by
fifties, when really the poor creatures only expected to be properly used as first-class
mule-drivers. Interpreters were then sent, and CAPTAIN ANNEsley, who knows no
end of language, offered to take them all in his division. This was acceded to, and
they were soon made happy and contented, working like slaves; so well, indeed,
that CAPTAIN ANNERLEY was thanked and complimented, and it was further pro-
mised that the threat of discharging them should not be carried out. Suddenly,
down comes an order to pay up and discharge them all, and to take away the
clothing they had received from the Government. They had all thrown away their
old rags, and the Government clothing was all they now had. . It was represented
how unjustifiable it would be to send the men back to Egypt in that plight, but
remonstrance was in vain. They were embarked under an armed guard, and an
officer of the department had to go on board and take the clothes from off their
backs. . In some cases they were allowed to keep their trousers, otherwise they
would have been utterly naked. This was on the 18th of February, when it is very
cold in the northern portions of the Red Sea, and even in Egypt. . . . . One day
about 150 of these poor devils came up jabbering to an officer, who could not under-
stand them, and reported it as a case of mutiny. Forthwith two companies of
infantry were sent down, and sixty of the Turks were tied up to the triangles and
got fifty lashes each. It then leaked out that the poor wretches had been three
days without rations, and were only complaining.”
Mr. Punch simply repeats the tale. He cannot improve it. Com:
ment on its monstrous combination of stupidity and brutality would
only weaken the force of the facts, if facts they be. If they are not
facts, the sooner .# arºdºnied the better for our reputation.
The truth is, that for all the pluck and “practical” good sense over
which he is so ready to hug himself, John Bull is too often the most
offensive of snobs,--brutal, pig-headed, and blundering-as odious, a
creature, altogether, as . that lives; a being to blush over, and to
repent in sackcloth and ashes for. - - -
Here—assuming this story to be true—the “nigger-driving” ele-
ment, which is one of the odious ingredients in JoHN BULL's character,
is in the ascendant; and the worst of the thing is, that nobody hesi-
tates about believing such a story. It is, in fact, only a reproduction,
on a large scale, of the blundering cruelty and overbearing stupidity
which mark the dealing of your English snob with “niggers,” where-
ever he has authority over them. Only of your English snob, however.
Happily, there is your English ſº.” to trim the scales. But then
your “smob” is so frightfully frequent in this blessed country! Is
there any other country under the sun so overrun with snobs—any
other where the snob is to be found, rampant, in all ranks, classes,
j: and, in such force that he often determines their tone, and
establishes their laws? We doubt it. The snob is the British Philis:
time, and not a corner in our island but boasts its GoLIATH... Punch
once tried his hand at a “Book of Snobs.” Alas! the subject is too
big for a book! It affords matter for a library.
Scientific and Seasonable Intelligence.
On Wednesday, : the First of April, the Harveian Lecture was
delivered before the College of Physicians by Professor HollowAY. .
The audience assembled in horour of the lecturer, and the anni-
versary, included a large number of visitors. . In accordance with a
saying, ascribed to ABERNETHY, that “at forty every man is either a
fool or a physician,” it was obſerved that many of them appeared to
be above forty.
ALL TIME DIFFERENCE,
MR. GLADstone is for dis-stablishing the Irish Protestant Church.
MR. DISRAELI, on the contrary, is for Diz-establishing it.

THE HEIGHT OF FASH! ON.
MORE GRIST TO THE MILL.
MEDICAL students will have read with some interest a telegram from
Florence, according to which :–
“In to-day's sitting in the Chamber of Deputies the debate on the Grinding-Tax
Bill was continued.”
There are many taxes that may be said to be grinding. Schedule.D,
by earners of precarious incomes, is felt to be a particularly grinding
tax. But a Grinding Tax Bill, so called by its authors, of course does
not mean a Bill by which a grinding tax is to be imposed. It must
signify a tax upon grinding, the consideration whereoſ may occasion
some of those youth who design themselves candidates for diplomas in
medicine and surgery to rejoice as being better off than the Italian
students are likely to be, in having no tax to pay on the only means o
possibly passing their examinations. - - --
It is curious, we may observe, taking another view of the Grinding
Tax Bill proposed by WICTOR EMMANUEL's Government, that such a
measure should have originated in Italy, how suitable soever it may be
for some Italians. . The British Legislature is that wherein, one would
think, the proposal would first have been made to tax Italian grinding
Organs.
SUBMARINE OBSTRUCTIONS.
IT appears that a Special Committee has been sitting since 1863 on
the subject of floating obstructions and submarine explosive structures
for sea-defence, and that they have already reported on “Passive Ob-
structions for the Defence of Harbours and Channels.” . D9 they
include in these the Board of Admiralty.” It professes to exist for the
defence of harbours and channels: it is eminently obstructive; and,
as passive means not active, it has every right to that epithet also.
Altogether, we should say it is a typical example of a “Passive Ob-
struction for the Defence of Harbours and Channels.”
A Beales Administration.
According to the Dispatch, the West-end Cabinet, Makers have
iven a testimonial to MR. BEALEs, to express their satisfaction with
#. conduct of the Reform agitation. It consists of an English oak
cabinet, embellished with a silver plate, bearing an inscription. So
now the great M.A. has been made by his supporters the master of a
Cabinet. This looks emblematical if not ominous. The multitude
may some day make BEALEs Prime Minister. If they do, no doubt
his Cabinet will still be a wooden one.
THE ARCHES JUDGMENT.
. SIB Robert, PHILLIMORE proceeded to give his elaborate judgment
in the cases of MARTIN v. MACKonochIE and FLAMANK v. Simpson.
The learned Judge, said that, in the first instance, it would be
necessary to give an historical and archaeological account of the Court
in which he was sitting, and he accordingly entered at great length
into a description of that Court, and of Bow Church in which it was
formerly held, and from the arched roof of which, de arcubus, the Court
took its name, and not, as some think, from the ARchbishop of CAN-
TERBURY, to...whom it belongs. He then described the origin of
Christianity, the corruption of the Church of Rome, the Reformation
of the Anglican branch, the Marian persecution, the stern rule of
ELIZABETH, and the regicide and Puritan troubles, and admitted that
in the lukewarm state of the Church in the time of the first GeoRGEs,
there was much extenuation for the present excess of zeal at Saint
Albans. Here he warned the Church, and his hearers not to con-
found the religious edifice in Holborn with St. Albans in Hertfordshire,
upon whose foundation in honour of the British protomartyr ALBAN,
and,into the disfranchisement of whose borough for corrupt election.
eering practices, the learned Judge animadverted for several hours.
He then sketched from evidence and from conjecture the early lives of
MESSRs. MACKONOCHIE and SIMPsqN, profoundly observing that an
investigation into the method in which a character had been trained
threw much light upon its subsequent development, a position which
he learnedly supported by citations from CICERO, Apollonius RHo-
DIUS, PLOTINUs, ANASTAsius, and the Seven against Thebes. Having
shown that in his youth MR. MACKONochie had been almost repre-
hensibly careless in his personal appearance, the learned Judge acutely
pointed out that the reaction which not unfrequently succeeds to such
carelessness might have induced that gentleman to over-excess in
regard to ecclesiastical costume, while in the case of MR. SIMPson,
who as a young man was remarkable for meatness, the Dean of Arches
felicitously indicated a persistence of nature which in other days might
have produced an IGNATIUS Loyola, of whose interesting and romantic
biography he then gave a brief but comprehensive view. He then
reverted to the main... thread of his judgment, and proceeding to
the question of candles, read an account of the Roman candle
(which he carefully distinguished from the elegant but dangerous
pyrotechnical device of that, name), which was composed of strin
surrounded by wax, or dipped in pitch, described the splinters of woo
fatted, which were the lights of the lower orders of England in 1300,
and the incorporation of the Wax Chandlers' Company in 1484. He
congratulated the Church that the question was not one of oil, because
that would have brought in HER MAJESTY's Coronation, and the re-
sults of the introduction of gas upon the whale fishery, both which
topics were providentially excluded from the present inquiry. It
would be unjust to do more than to condense the remainder of his
remarks, in which he proved, inter alia, that although in CHAUCER,
RABELAIS, HUDIBRAs, and Don Juan there were many references to
ecclesiastics and their habits, it would not be safe entirelytodepend upon
secular, not to say profane authors, for authorised teaching upon the
f| dogmas of the Church. It was clear, he thought from the sixth Homil
against Excess in Apparel, which he read in extenso, that the Church §
not especially favour a theatrical tendency in adornment in private life,
though he jºi that this had nothing to do with the question of
Church vestments, but then as the question of vestments had not come
before him, so that he was relieved from the painful necessity of enter-
ing into it at any length. On the question of incense, the Dean
was especially elaborate, and detailed its various preparations,
Hebrew, Greek, and Roman, and urged that though at first it
was excusable and even meritorious, as, it tended to counteract
the unpleasant odours arising from assemblages of uncivilised persons,
in times when lavation and perfume was not so well understood, it was
hard to find the same justification for it in the present day, when per-
sonal cleanliness is the rule, and when, as he showed by some prolonged
extracts from M. EugèNE, RIMMEL’s work on Perfumery, private
persons could for a trifling ſoutlay save the Established. Church any
necessity for providing odours. Having gone, with similar conscien:
tiousness, into the other questions of ceremonial and manipulation, and
having proved by abundant extracts from SouTHEY's Book ºf the Church
that the Roman Catholic and the Protestant religion one origin,
and that the only reason why the churches could not happily reconcile
was the deplorable fact that there were insurmountable differences in
the way, as he showed from, DIQDoRus SIGULUS, Pokphy Ry, and
TRUNCULUS ELEPHANTIACUs, the Dean gave his judgment for Lighted
ainst Elevation, Incense, and Mixed Wine (except
mixed privately) and regretted that a more important authority than
himself had not happened to be called in tantas componere lites. The
majority of the audience had fainted with fatigue long previously, but
an agent of the defendants had strength to give three cheers, and was
then carried out of Court, followed by the learned Dean, who apo-
logised to him for omitting to quote a fine passage from the Gesta
Romanorum.

PICTURES IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
LET Mr. Punch pay his tribute to an act of Christian kindness and
true sympathy with suffering on the part of a brother artist, MR;
ABsolon, who without money-payment has given three months of
well-occupied time to the painting of ten pictures in distemper, for the
decoration of one of the sick wards of Guy's Hospital.
lt is sad, from a sick bed, day after day, week after week, to have
no choice for, the weary eye between the blank white-washed walls
before it, and the sufferings, all around. To provide a pleasanter
resting place for the patients' ken in one of the wards of Guy's, MR.
ABsolon has painted these pictures, scenes of pleasant, bright, out:
door life—a fisherman's wife, watching on the beach for the return of
her husband's boat; young men and maids, tossing the tedded hay;
gleaners coming home at eventide with their gathered, sheaves; har-
vesters eating, their mid-day meal in the shadow of the oat-stooks;
a º. of English rustic lovers at a stile; a Scotch lad and lassie, he
taking a thorn from her round arm—the su gestion is BURNs's; a
congregation gathering in an English village churchyard of the olden
time; a brace of Swiss mädchen in their hay-boat, on the lake at the
glacier foot; a group of Italian contadine gathered about the fountain
-and as the central, subject, summing up the thought which has
inspired the series, the gentle figure of Mercy from the Pilgrim's
Progress. The pictures are of large dimensions, some nine or ten feet
by six or seven, and executed boldly and broadly in distemper, in a
material and style which will give the right effect for works to be
hung some twenty-five feet from the floor, and viewed from the other
side of a spacious hospital-ward.
e should never look gift-horses in the mouth, and it would be out
of place to criticise these F. as we should criticise works pro-
duced for sale, or prompted by desire of distinction or display of ºi
But we may say without, impropriety that MR, ABsolon's pictures are
excellent specimens, of the broad and decorative kind, full of open-air
brightness and sunshine, and, in their colour and treatment, as in their
selection of subjects, well calculated to cheer and enliven those whose
sad and suffering hours they are meant to beguile. Why should not
entirely at the cost of the artist, as in this case.
DOUBLE-ACTION. -
(BY THE RIGHT HonourABLE B. D'DIs RAELI.)
As in harps so in men, again and again,
I’ve proved to my own satisfaction,--
And as far as effront'ry could prove to the country-
There's no secret like “Double ACTION.”
If you want to progress, yet keep out of a mess,
And hold place in defiance of faction,
Adverse notions to burke, and consistency shirk,
The secret is still Double Action.
If a man in a ship wants to make a clean º
From port to port, say does he tack shun
No, he first works to starboard, and then works tolarboard,
In fact he adopts Double Action.
In opinions or schemes still betwixt two extremes,
Truth lies, and requires a transaction,
A touch of black, here, and a touch of white, there,
That is, in two words, Double Action.
Thus my weight I divide, one half on a side,
So to balance the other's attraction,
And, in medio tutus, defy to confute us
The fools who eschew Double Action.
... WINEGAR FOR A ROCK.
We noticed, with our usual chivalry; the new “Evange.
|lical” paper, the Rock. We also smiled at its ludicrous
|little picture. The smile has gone round, and the Journal
has discovered an obliging correspondent:-
“THE Rock.-In reply to several correspondents who have do:
murred at our choice of the emblem which adorus our pages. and
which is intended to represent the rocky eminences of Ararat, which
the Persians call ‘the happy mountain,' from its having been the
resting-place of the Ark, a friend vindicates its appropriaten-. He
thinks that a more fitting emblem could scarcely have been chosen
for The Rock, whose principles are those upon which alone the true
Ark,” &c., &c. -
We omit the profanity, and merely suggest that on the
Rock's own, showing, Ararat was, a place, on which a con;
struction which had been quite done with was abandoned
by wise folks, who came out of it. Is that the Rock's
notion of the Church of England P
the example, MR. Absolon has set be followed P − not, however,
Why should not
some of the many, who at once love Art and feel for suffering, sub-
scribe to have similar series, of decorative pictures, executed for
other wards of other hospitals? Think of the delight that might
thus be diffused at comparatively little cost; for those who wrought
in such a cause would, we are very sure, be as liberal with their
labour as those who commissioned them with their purses.
There are the men—DUNCAN, GeoRee FRIPP, WiLLIAM BEVERLEY,
TELBIN, John GILBERT, and scores beside-what need to enumerate
them?—Who will take up our hint, and say to them, here is the work?

we are, I am in possession of no mechanical contrivances, no sort of

She bowed slightly, in token of acquiescence, and he proceeded,
I place this tiny pellet upon your work-table, which I see stands
sadly in need of repairing, and I hide it for one minute from your view
by the simple process of covering it with one of the three thimbles
with which you have kindly furnished me. Moving these rapidly from

reverence of a character so gradually revealed--so new to her. Then
she glanced downwards towards his feet. He interpreted her glance,
and answered it. - - 22
“They are sea-legs,” he said. “I will make you a pair.
Presently he came up from below with a, beaming face. I have
discovered our exact position.” GRACE looked at him inquiringly,

Towards evening GRACE complained of an unsatisfied Graving for
nutritious food. The flight of the Pangofflins was indeed a loss.
Nutt sat silent for a few minutes. Then he turned to her.
“Will you play on the piano 2' he asked: - -
“I cannot sing the old songs,” she replied, “but I will comply with
your request.” - - -
While she struck the few remaining notes, he was busy fashioning a
pin into a hook-shape.
Then he dropped his line into the sea. -
“I have no ; he said, “and your music is now our sole chance.

A tremendous splash and a heave, which, as appeared to her, nearly
capsized the frail tenement, caused her to leap from her music-stool in
consternation.
“Ah!” she exclaimed in terror.

Neither.
“Do not be afraid,” cried the voice of NUTT, reassuring her, “it is
a terrific looking monster, but he will not hurt you.”
He had hooked and landed an enormous marine creature, which
writhed in grotesque twistings as it opened its jaws, and flapped its
fins and tails against the sides of the drawing-room.
“Oh, take him away, he will spoil the furniture,” was the feminine
cry which rose to her lips; but she immediately checked herself, and
holding out her hand to NUTT, said smiling, “Forgive me, I am very
foolish, I know.”
*We are indeed fortunate in securing such a prize as this, MIss
MARCHMONT,” said NUTT, securing the creature from committing
further acts of violence, by holding one of his antennae, nipped tightly
in the forceps of the tongs. “It is the developed Shrimp of the
Antipodes, and is known in Southern waters as The Colleen Prawn.
Its fin is equal to the most savoury turtle, its flesh just over the ribs
..nearly º: in flavour the delicate Southdown, the brain has all
the qualities of the most plump partridge, while the “coral” which
comes away in clusters, far excels the plover's eggs, and the tail is far
superior to the ordinary apple-tart, upon which so much store is set in
more northern climes. When stewed it distils from itself a delicious
liquor, scientifically known as Shandegaf. Its presence here shows we
are not far from land.”
“He has fallen overboard l’”
He looked at her: her face was pale, and in another second she
would have fallen to the ground but for his support.
"I have talked too much,” he said, kindly. “You are hungry.”
. So saying he at once Hº! to cut %m his new acquisition a
F. of rich juicy meat. The fire was burning, (he had contrived to
eep it perpetually alight, as he had only a few matches, which he
knew could not be easily replaced), and placing the teapot upon it, he
had in a few minutes cooked sufficient to serve for their meal.
Then they, sat down and ate heartily. It was like pork-chops.
After º dinner they drank from the thimbles a portion of the
Prawn's Shandegaf, which indeed was hardly less strong than a liqueur.
Then they suffered from, indigestion. But neither spoke of their
sufferings to the other. So they sailed on for three hours.
GRACE was the first to arouse herself.
“If we are, so near land, would it not be possible to see it? But,”
she immediately added, fancying that NUTT was hurt by the insinuation,
“we have no telescope.”
. NUTT, from whose face-ºll traces of the Boomerang native were fast
disappearing," looked quickly round.
She watched his movements eagerly." He seized the drawing-hearth
broomstick, which could be lengthened or shortened at will, and
wrenching off the brushend, pulled it out to its full length, and applied
it to his eye. .
GRACE was in ecstasies. It was indeed just like a telescope. He
then explained to her how a glass with water in it possessed magnifying
properties, and one without water did not. The first, a tumbler half
filled with sea-water, he fixed on the larger end, the handle; the other,
a wine-glass partially filled, he attached at right angles to the smaller
end where the brush had formerly been.
With this instrument he reconnoitred, for some time unsuccessfully.
At length a loud shout escaped him.
“...We cannot be far distant from the coast of Benicia,” he cried.
She clasped her hands in expectant agitation.
. “Through the large end I distinguish the shape of a buoy. On it
is some writing. They have only one of this sort to mark the ship line
off the Benecia coast, and as I read it—” he began to spell “B. E.—”

SOMETHING MORE FROM OUR ARTIST.
To the Editor of “Chikkin Hazard.”
DEAR SIR,
The drawing sent herewith requires some little explanations.
I have again, as you see, chosen a subject for illustration out of the
depths of my own consciousness. None of the incidents mentioned in
the MS. are pictorial; moreover, I did not receive the MS. in time;
moreover, when I did receive it I could not make it out, on account
of the numerous erasions and corrections by different hands.
On the other hand it struck me that GRACE and the Boomerang
must occasionally have found the time hang rather heavily on their
hands; and I have tried to show how the Boomerang, being a man of
many parts and possessed of varied and delightful accomplishments,
was able to divert GRACE’s mind from her peculiarly painful position
(on the roof of the ark). Faithfully yours,
GASTON DE MALALEIL.
P.S.. I have put them in evening costume, to show that in sº
their forlorn position, they still preserve their self-respect and c
the habits of good society. The bird is intended for a tame pan-
the pangofflin is a variety of the spoonbill, at least so my ornit'

of utterance, a metropolitan bard would have to make those two
names read thus :-
You’ll own that ABERG'ENNY's no mean cove, nor

whether that it is not an orthographical mistake * , I have heard some
people so pronounce a name spelt otherwise, and, I want to know
whether it is nobbish or snobbish to say, WILLARs for WILLIERs. . As

CHAPTER XV. -
THE SYREN'S WOICE.
PIEL DoRNTON had calculated his chances cleverly; perhaps too
º for it is so difficult for a sharp man of the Dornton stamp to
avoid being just a thought too clever for himself. He stretches out
his arm to gain his object, but having griped the coveted possession,
he overbalances himself and falls. The Rev. PIEL DoRNTon had not
yet fallen, but was he overbalancing himself? This was a question for
the business conclave which met behind the glass doors in the Banking
House of CHEKK, Diss, Count & Co., the great Benicia Agents.
Their decision was that the papers in their hands were correct, and
they could find no reason for disputing the legality of the several
instruments.
So PIRL DQRNTON was cringed to, and bowed to, and fawned upon
by the Benicians, and visiting cards from the wife of the Lord #.
Admiral, and the Bishop's Lady, down to the last importation into
Benician salons, were showered in at the doors and windows of
Phlebosco Palace, now the residence of the fortunate clergyman.
. On the tenth day after the disappearance of Wolcano Villa with its
living freight, it became painfully evident that the Lieutenant and
GRACE had ceased to exist.
The Rev. PIEL DoRNTon invited the inhabitants to a Masqued Ball,
and he himself, as Cupid, was the gayest, and apparently the most
light-hearted of all that merry, chattering, brilliant crowd.
“You are so satirical,” said LADY ANNA Domino, removing her
mask in order the more, easily and gracefully to apply her lace-em-
broidered mouchoir, to her aristocratically-chiselled nose, a custom
which the highly refined though somewhat artificial Benicians inva-
riably adopt on occasions such as we are describing.
Not to you,” murmured PIEL, looking into her full hazel eyes,
whose lids were gradually lowered under his steady gaze.
h ºut you love some one else,” she whispered, turning away her
eaQ1.
“No ; on my soul, no,” exclaimed, DoRNTON, passionately. The
sound of the waltz came fitfully through the doors.
..She was a handsome woman, LADY ANNA, and she knew it. Through
life, ever since her early impulsive marriage with the dissolute SIR
FALSENows Dom(INo, (who, criblé des dettes, had died, leaving her his
entire property) her experience among men of the world had been of
the veni, widi, vici order.
And now, what was this had suddenly come over her? Was she, the
charmer, to be charmed at last? Had she, who had made even women's
natural enemies, the serpents, dance to her piping, at length found the
serpent who was to pipe to her dancing Where was the fascination ?
Or was it he who was fascinated after all?
He watched her lying at full length upon the snow-white ottoman
beneath the overhanging fuchsias and dainty jessamines; he watched
her, as she arranged her pink satin, dress, with its drapery of moirá
antique, trimmed with the rarest embrocation, seldom applied, except,
as now, externally, and he smiled as she threw herself back, reclining
upon the damask pillows. A coronet of diamonds, each separate stone
far exceeding the koh-i-moor, sparkled in her dark hair; rings flashed
and coruscated again and, again, lighting her taper fingers ; small
| tinkling bells, Benician fashion, sounded from her sandals as she pressed
the drawing-room pile, or shook her feet twinklingly, over the edge of
the fauteuil., Torches of naphtha (for PIEL DoRNTon spared no ex:
pense) shed their soft light upon her, and upon the cream-like and
rosy tints of the cold frozen ice and small thin wafer cake which she
had taken for her refreshment in that pale voluptuous hand.

. “Do not talk the world's cant to me,” said PIEl DoRNTON, suddenly
rising and violently kicking over the ormolu, tables, the lamps, the
chairs, and the bigger ornaments in the room. “I know you—beautiful
as you are, I know you.” He stood by the mantel-piece glaring upon
her. Her eyes looking up, met his, and she listened intently. . She
had never seen him in this mood before. “Tell me,” he said, calmly,
yet with firm, determination as he flung the velvet stool through the
window, “Tell me, why am I here **
For one moment she, the conqueror, the syren, who loved so many
to their destruction, felt how she had been trapped, caged, caught.
PIEL DoRNTon rose from the hearth, and coming towards, her,
clasped her waist in his iron grasp. She was powerless in his hand,
and suffered herself to be carried into the ball-room like a child,
The Bishop was bringing the festival to a close by leading the last
dance, which, as is the Benician custom, has something in it of the
religious element and of the action of worship; the entire movement
has its own peculiar music, and is dedicated to one of the Island's
patron saints, St. Vitus—the other patron being the guardian of
Hospitality, namely St. Invite-us. - - - -
PIEL Doānron forced LADY ANNA to kneel down, as his ecclesiastical
superior removed from his face the white and red colours which had
served him for a temporary disguise during the Masque. -
“My Lord,” exclaimed PIEL, seizing the Bishop's hand, “She will
be my wife.” - - -
“Bene ego nunquam /* said the good Bishop, piously. “Fecitti tu
unquam f*
IEL took a ring from the finger of the fainting LApy ANNA, and
was preparing to repeat the usual formula after the Bishop, when a
slight rustling was heard in the crowd, and a black figure, closely hooded
but with two brilliant eyes piercing through the apertures of her mask,
stepped forward. On one arm she supported what was apparently a
large oblong shaped bundle.
The disengaged hand she stretched out, and before the bystanders
could prevent her —

“Who brought this?” he cried, when he had read it.
No one could tell him. It was a black-hooded mask, and she had
gone, silently, as she had come. - - - -
LADY ANNA fainted, and was carried insensible to a fountain, in
whose sparkling basin she was tenderly deposited, in the hopes that
the cold fresh water would revive her. -
“Who will take a message for me?” muttered DoRNTon to him-
self, confusedly, “Is there no one I can send ?” .
As if in answer to his ºn thought, a voice from the throng
around hissed shrilly, “Me vil.”
“Who spoke f" asked DoRNTon. A small form emerged from the
crowd. It was the bundle which the Mysterious Mask had on her
arm : a child.
“How old are you?” asked DoRNToN.
“Fourteen months and a half,” was the ready answer.
“The emissary for my purpose,” said Piel to himself. A bold bad
man cannot act alone; he needs an instrument, a tool; rarely do bold
bad men find such an one present to their hand as did Piel DoRNTox
now.
º You know the town well?” he inquired, before handing him the
note.
“Wew vel,” answered the infant.
“Your name * *

Had not the ears of PIEL DoRNToN been careless to their own good,
he would have recognised in the infant's lisping accents the name of
Dixon, and he would in all probability have called to mind the mother's

words in the garden, uttered only a few short days ago, “Down comes
the Cradle, The Baby . . . AND ALL!” -
But he heeded not signs and sounds which might have saved him
even then. -
“Take the letter, BILLEE,” he said, and gave it to the boy.
* Largethe,” urged the child, extending its hand.
“He means Largesse,” observed a bystander.
DoRNToN regarded him curiously for a moment.
“We have met before,” he said. -
The child's clear upward gaze brought no distinct time or place to
his memory, and so dismissing the matter from his thoughts, he threw
the urchin a piece of jº: and waving back the curious crowd, he
pressed his brows over his hat, and bidding them look to the comfort
of the LADY ANNA, strode from the ball-room, and scattering the
pampered menials right and, left, touched a secret º the wall,
which, turning on a *; allowed him to pass through, and instanta-
neously closed behind him. -
“At this moment 'º' he muttered, shaking his clenched fistin impotent
rage tºwards the starry firmament. “To send to me now / But no

Here he thrust his hand into his open west, and smiled with bitter
scom as he continued, “She shall be mine. Had I risked so much to
stop short of my object now? PIEL DoRNToN, there is a devil luring
thee. What care 1 P Devil or angel to-night decides her fate and
mine, perhaps, for ever. So that is well,” he said, as he drew a
twelve-shooter from his pocket, and examined the priming. This
will enforce, when arguments and cajoleries fail.” He trifled with the
weapon for a few minutes, firing it off, loading and reloading, aiming
at a tree while running, until he appeared satisfied with his own pro-
ficiency. Then he paused. ...What was that?, a rustle?. He fired into
the bushes. With a scream like that of a child, a wild cat bounded
forth and was lost to sight in the surrounding gloom.
PIEL DoRNTox, who was an excellent shot, fired again, and the
animal fell mortally wounded..." Bah!”, exclaimed Phil for ston,
“This is folly. I have many miles to walkere I reach her house. It
must be done to-night—to night!.. I have sworn it, and it shall be
done.” He turned out of the public path, and took his way by the
Black Pine Wood. Alone. -
As he disappeared among the arboriferous productions of a beneficent
Nature, a small form emerged from behind a bush, and stole cautiously
into the deep darkness of the night. . .
The diminutive watcher was searching for something. At last he
stopped, and examined what appeared to be a ºfs. bundle of
white fur. -
“In my power now,” said the strange being to itself, “and he wanted
to know if we'd met before. Yeth, MITHTER DOENTON, and we’ll
meet again thoon. Ha! Thee!” -
The clouds breaking allowed the moon to send her strong bright
white light upon the ground, bringing out a tall retreating shadow.
Concealing himself from the receding pedestrian's view §: crouching
within the deep shade of the shadow-head, and moving on hands and
feet evenly with it, LITTLE BILLEE (for he it was as our readers may
haye already guessed) closely followed him, dogging his footsteps.
So they descended the hill. One bent on his own cruel selfish pur-
pose, utterly unconscious of the other; the latter with all the concen:
irated hate and suspicion of an infant's nature, pursuing steadily and
marking down his prey.
Once and once º the thought crossed him that a struggle was
inevitable, and he clutched his coral more firmly, and hushed the
jingling silver bells, which, sounding mournfully in the night wind, fell
on PIELDoRNTON's ear as a warning knell; but he heeded it not, and
in his pride and false security strode onward to his fate.
The Benician Island was lulled in repose as PIEL DoRNToN crossed

word admitted by a majority, and this bracket inserted in justice to the minority

ublic. Gentlemen, according to the published artſcles of this Company [Vide
so. 1391 of this Journal for March 7, 1868, page 105. Ed..] the Directors, the Authors,
and the Editor, only and solely, individually, and collectively, separately and each
for himself or for others associated with him, reserve to himself, to herself (*.* An

To hold in reserve the rights of printing and publishing such notes as “they,” the
aforesaid, “may deem necessary for the clear explanation of the novel, the benefit
of the public at large, and their mutual protection." Now, Gentlemen, we, the
undersigned and aforesaid, do beg to call yºur attention to the constant breaches of
this stipulated egreement łrom time to time on the part of the EDITOR, in conjunc-
tion with cre of the gentle men *f; as ARTISTS by the present Company, a
entleman recently coming out of his ambush, and signing himself Gaston de
alaloeil, which we believe is not his name, [*.* Yes it is.-Ed.,] which aforesaid
breach of agreement consists in the Antist being allowed to issue his own notes—not,
with even then questionable taste, through the Editor and under his plume, but as
ºne of the notes to the tale of Chikkin Hºard, in which he disparages our combina-
tions, disputes our conclusions, and finally with a transparent apology, ventures to
draw, upon his own resources for an illustration to his own puerile invention.
Gentlemen, we demand the immediate dismissal of the Editor, and that a severe
reprimand be conveyed to the Artist. If our demand is not instantly complied with,
we resign. (Signed by the majority of the Authors, and for the rest.)
The Directºrs to the Authors.—Gentlemen, we can only repeat that we have the
greatest confidence in the Editor's discretion, we leave the matter entirely in his
bands, feeling sure that we can carry on the Company with the present novel to a
most, successful issue, aided only by the minority who did not sign the recent
manifesto.
Directors to Editor.—Can't you make capital out of this slight fracas, and puff the
novel? Thus: have a bill out headed “Dismissal of The Editor (this day.
FEARFUI, SCENE between AN ARTIST and AN AUTHOR engaged on the Great
Novel of CH]KKIN HAZARD." Puff it, sir, puff it.
Editor to Directors—It's your business to puff it., Do it: only don't play tricks
with my name, as I am advised that an action for libel willlie.
Editor to the Authors.-In allusion to the above difference which has unfortunately
arisen between the literary and artistic gentlemen connected with the publication of
this admirably written and beautifully illustrated novel, the Editor feels assured that
the misunderstanding is of the most trivial and temporary nature, and that, as far as
he is personally concerned, he is certain that with the courteous answer of the Direc-
tors the affair will be brought at once to a happy termination,-he, as Editor, explain-
ing to them, that as he holds somany paid-up shares, and also his present position, by
distinct written and stamped agreement with the Directors, in return for having
§. the Company, it will impossible for him to yield to their demand for
is dismissal without gross injustice to himself, and therefore he is willing to go so
far as to promise that no notes from the Artists shall be admitted henceforth as
genuine unless countersigned by him, the Editor; and finally, he does most sin-
cerely hope that he may trust to the good feeling, forbearance, and gentlemanly
tone of all concerned, to prevent any contrétemps occurring just as the work is
progressing so favourably.
From Some of the Authors.-The explanation is satisfactory. But in allusion to the
letter signed Gaston de Malaloeil, we wish to know who sent the telegrams to the
Artist about the picture? The telegraph boy who was sent backwards and forwards
has not received a single sixpence. His mother, a most respectable person, has
called to-day to prefer a charge against nine gentlemen for cruelty in overworking
the lad. Justice, Sir, to the aged mother.
Editor's Note:-The Directors will see to this. The other Artists are now preparing
their blocks, so Gentlemen, pray get on with your thrilling story, as I am dying to
know whether the Boomerang does turn out to be —, also if PIEL DoRNToN ulti-
mately - as I supposed, and so on to the end. Once again, the above difficulties
being perfectly smoothed and everything settled, let me press upon you most
strongly that the Editor does hope that the continuation of the good feeling, for-
bearance, and gentlemanly tone of all concerned will prevent any contratemps
occurring just as the work is progressing so favourably.
ANOTHER SMASH FOR SPIRITUALISTS.
THANKs in a great measure to the jokes of Mr. Punch, the spirits
have left off their concert-giving lately. But how easy it would be to
copy, their performances will be seen from what PRöFEssoRTYNDAL
has disclosed, in one of his late interesting Lectures upon Sound:—
“There is practically no limit to the distance through which sound may be
transmitted through tubes or rods of wood. The music of instruments in a lower
room may be made to pass to a higher floor, where it is excited by a proper sound-
ing-bcard, being all the while inaudible in the intermediate floors through which it
passes.”
The spirits, we repeat, have not been musical of late, or at any rate
their concerts have not been widely advertised. Still, as their per-
formances may ere long be resumed, for gulls as well as geese are very
plentiful in England, it may be worth our while to notice that without
the aid of spirits, sounds may be conveyed from one room to another,
as easily as a waiter could convey that of a codfish. If a guitar or an
accordion were played upon down-stairs the sounds might be trans-
mitted . the help of wooden tubes to the apartment where the spirits
were holding their séance, and thus might wondrously astonish the
weak minds of the audience.

As it is probable that in the course of future Irish Church debates,

The letters on its leaflets make the legend, TRUTH and LOWE. .
And that’s a spell diffuses a magic all around,
And clothes with bud and blossom the hardest hungriest ground.
To the fairy-well it grew by two streams run side by side,
One from Tººth's bitter fountain, one from LOWE'S sweet spring
Supplied,
But round about the margin sharp shards and flints were piled,
And thistles thorns and nettles grew stinging rank and wild.
And if any water struggled through those stones and weeds to day
'Twas now the bitter, now the sweet, that forced its separate way.
And ever and anon came they who filled their pipkins full
From the bitter stream for Erin, who thereat wry mouths would
pull,
And turn away to them that drew of Love's stream warm and sweet,
Though | flººd by truth untempered it un-nerved head, hands,
and teet. - - -
While if one stooped to clear the stones and pluck the weeds away

Until at last there came the hour, and with the hour, the man
Who set at naught opposing hands, nor heeded shriek nor ban. .
But thrust the hard and heaped-up stones and stinging growths aside,
And made way for those parted rills henceforth in one to glide:
So letting warm attemper cold, and bitter season sweet,
That the waters mixed were cordial, whereof each was poison, meat.
And where these streams first mingle for blessing and for boon,
And ripple golden to the sun, and silver to the moon
This four-leaved shamrock hangs its head the sister founts above-
And proclaims upon its leaflets its nurses TRUTH and LOVE.

Those leaves, but ALEXANDRA, the Loving and the K. P

FAC-SIMILE OF A C
RECENTLY DISCOWERED IN THE SEED AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
URIOUS BAS-RELIEF
A PLEA FOR THE POLICE.
WHEN.Mr. Punch next takes the chair at any public dinner, he pro-
bably will startle, some old fogies in the company by making an addi: |
tion to the usual list of toasts. After doing honour to the Army and
the Navy and “Our Gallant Wolunteers,” Mr. Punch will fill a special
bumper to the health of the Police. They may fitly now be classed
among our national defenders; and, indeed, the many dangers they
encounter in our service entitle them most thoroughly to have their
health ...]". whenever public toasts are drunk. Knocked down,
and kic and stamped upon with heavy hobnailed boots, and bon-
neted and bludgeoned, and beaten black and blue—to all this our
Policemen are well nigh as well used as the eels were said to be to
skinning; and, in addition to all this, they have of late been shot at,
and have served under fire as bravely as any of our troops. |
For encountering these perils, and for the weary work of ten hours,
daily watching in the streets, the wage is nineteen shillings weekly,
with a hope by slow degrees to earn six shillings more. The man who
rises to be sergeant, as not one in ten can do, will get eight-and-twenty
shillings weekly for his work; and, what his qualities must be, the
following will show:—
“To enter the police as constable a man must bring a long and unimpeachable
character for honesty, industry, sobriety, intelligence, and good temper. . . . . An
able constable who is offered a Sergeant's vacancy has to go through an educational
examination which, ten years ago, would have broken half the Civil Service candi-
dates. The arithmetic and writing he has to do are, perhaps, in these days not
thought so dreadful as they used to be, but he has to draw out hypothetical cases of
police charges, and to give answers in writing to such cases, stating whether he
would detain or liberate prisoners under such and such circumstances, and his
reasons in writing for or against.”.
Plenty to do and little to get is evidently now the rule in the Police
: and ºne is not surprised tº learn that the matter is becoming
one of chronic discontent.”. Skinflints may contend that while the ranks
cºntinue full, there surely is no need to proffer higher 3. . But men
who are not skinflints will not let their eyes be blin º; a short-
sighted economy, and will have the wisdom;
“To look at three things-1st, that the police service now requires a much higher
class of men than was thought necessary when they started as watchmen in 1830;
2nd, that the growth of the force has by no means kept pace with the growth of the
metropolis they have to guard; 3rd, that 19s. a week now is not much more than
equal to 14s. a week fortyº: ago. The deduction is obvious. Not only must the
fºrce be increased, but the pay must be such as to induce good men to enter, and,
above all, when entered, to remain in the service. Entering the police force should,
saw a large steam-roller at work, upon the roadway!
in its pay and future rewards, be held out as an object of ambition to able and re-
spectable men, and not regarded, as it is now by the most intelligent constables, as
i.º resource against want, to be retained only till something better presents
With ruffianism rampant, and Fenianism scarce º and robº
beries with violence still frequent in our streets, it will hardly be denied
that we have urgent need of a strong army of Police. There is little to be
gained by being º in the matter, except the chance of a picked
§. or a broken head; and skinflints who object to increasing the
olice rates, if they find themselves garotted, may be told it serves
them right.
A TERRIBLE STREET IMPROVEMENT.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I write with º horror, s
rise and indignation to
inform you that the other day, as I was w
ing down Park Lane, I
There was a
crowd of starers round it, as though it were a Dodo or a Plesiosaurus,
or some other praediluvian and now non-extant monster, Viewing it
myself as a proof of the levelling spirit of the age, Iown the sight of it
excited in me pangs of grief and terror. “Stare super anti vias”
is the maxim I admire, and I hate new-fangled notions of what some
call, “street improvements.” Especially I hate to see true Britons
condescending to take lessons from the French, as in this matter of
street-rolling. Far better let our carriages be knocked about and
splintered in the good old-fashioned way, and our bones be bum
and bruised, and battered as they used to be, than degrade ourselves
by cop § those confounded foreigners, and by driving on smooth
roads which may lead us to destruction... Steam-rollers, to mythink:
ing, must end in revolutions, and if we Frenchify our streets we shall
soon see barricades in them.
I remain, Sir, yours in some alarm,
ONE OF THE OLD SCHOOL.
P.S. Nothing is safe nowadays. The Irish Church is threatened-
Saint Paul's go ere long, and Windsor Castle follow it—while the
regalia at the Tower, being useless in a Commonwealth, will be pawned
or put to auction to reduce the national debt.

“The Parcel of a Reckoning.”
For a reason which it might be uncivil to assign, we have no great
distaste for seeing jº folks at log erheads. Just now the
Great Small Parcels question is up. A tradesman desires to pay the
railway for carrying one big parcel, which is made up of lots of small
parcels, to be delivered by his agent. The railway says that every
parcel is a parcel, and ought to be paid for. If Mr. Panch were a
É. London grocer he would support the former, if a Railway Share-
older, the latter; but as, it is he is like the American l who,
beholding her husband fighting with a bear, remarked that it was the
first time she had ever seen a fight without caring which licked.

the following pas-
sage in the “Sporting

world by ARGUs :—
“It would be unjust

by the example they
made of a person who
had lately committed a
glaring robbery, in or-
º his jockey, after
starting, to up at th
first fence and return home, whereby his backers were deº º: i.
their money. The cºmmittee sat, in Petty Sessions in Burlington Street, and the

rom running any Steeplechase under the rules of the Committee for the next five
ears, and that the jockey be suspended from riding until next year, provided he
not drunk himself to death within that time, which is more than probable from
the appearance he presents.”
“A couple of cads, very rightly served, especially the jockey's
employer, the lower cad of the two.” Such, Sir, º: . id: 3.
foregoing statement very naturally suggested to my mind. But judge,

HOW TO QUASH THE QUACKS.
MY DEAR MR. HARDY, -
Allow me to congratulate you, on, your famous Irish Church
speech. I like to hear a man speak plainly and not beat about the
| bush, even though, as in your case, I may not at all agree with him.
|... As you have now a character for pluck, as well as firmness, I hope
that º will shortly exercise those qualities in dealing with a matter
which undoubtedly demands them. A man must have, some courage
to stamp upon a skunk, and that is what a medical journal now
requires of you :-
“We venture to hope that the Home Secretary will be induced to press forward
the Medical Acts Amendment Bill, which will rob the quacks of their power to
assume medical titles. It has been lying in the Home Office for three years; and
SIR GEORGE GREY, MR. WALPole, and MR. BARDY have, in turn, expressed a general
approval of its main provisions, but pressure of “public business' has hitherto pre-
vented the measure from being introduced.”
There can hardly be, much public business which should be deemed
more pressing than that of taking care of the health of the public.
Salus populi suprema lear, as your classical constituents could easily
explain to you. Now, the people's health is constantly endangered by
quack doctors, in dealing with these miscreants the law should be
supreme, Take away the titles which they falsely assume, and you
deprive them in great measure of their power to offend. The boobies
who consult the quacks are of all people the likeliest to be º: by a
fine name, and when a quack bedubs himself “licentiate,” or “doctor,”
the boobies think his title, has been legally acquired, and flock to fill
the swindler's pockets with their fees. Distinguo is a word unknown
in their vocabulary, and any advertising scoundrel who calls himself a
doctor to their mind ranks as highly as a qualified M.D.
Help the boobies, therefore, and help to quash the quacks, and be
laudatus à landato, even by your, 38836%.
PUNCH AT THE PALACE.
“Now,” said Mr. Punch, with what remained of his fine voice, after
cheering all the way from Putney up to Mortlake, “Now is the time to
visit the Crystal Palace l’”
This remarkable remark was made at half-past noon on Saturday the
Fourth, and few of those who heard it were aware of its significance.
But it occurred to Mr. Punch that, having shaken hands with Oxford,
the proper thing to do was to get away, to §º. ... For after
hearing the young oarsmen give their details of their race, it seemed a
pleasant contrast to hear the “Ancient Mariner.” - -
Besides the flowers, and the air, and the Bath buns, and the beer,
there is always something fresh at the charming Crystal Palace. Fresh
music especially is certain to be found there, tha to Ma. MANNs,
| that most electric of conductors. A new symphony by MENDELssoHN,
a new symphony by Schubert, these the Crystal Concerts have this
| winter introduced, and, by way of further novelty, they add the
“Ancient Mariner.” -- - -
Mr. Punch goes to a concert to enjoy, and not to criticise; so, he
will not perplex his readers with a critical description and account of
this cantata, however strongly he be tempted to show off such fine
phrases as “melodic progression” and “contrapuntal cleverness,”
which every critic nowadays has at his pen's tip, Mr. Punch will only
say that good music invariably gives him a good appetite, and that on
Saturday the Fourth his hunger was so great after listening to the
concert that he was forced to get a dinner impromptu at the Palace:
and this impromptu dinner proved to be so good a one, that Mr. Punch
in making it took all the time he could, and then pronounced it un
impromptu fait a loisir.

ANOTHER bit of spooneyism exposed. Soft people actually believed
that the betting fellows at Tattersall's had gentle moments, and were
in the habit of stealing aside to deposit small money in the box of
St. George's hospital. To make this easier for the kind creatures, a
box was put up for them in their own haunt, and at the end of the year
there were found a bad fourpenny piece and many bits of tobacco-pipe.
The old hospital-box had its usual £100, or more. However, the spooney
can continue to believe as before, and that the betting men did not like
to risk their charity in their own box. -

CANINE.
Toby prays that Mr. Punch will find room for the following, which,
he fancies, will be read with considerable alarm by those who are Old-
Bogyfied by fears of Centralisation:—
“The Inland Revenue Collectors, to the affairs of which department has been
delegated the duty of collecting the new dog tax, have received payment on no less
than 400,000 dogs more than the old parochial collectors. This success is a fresh
§§ in the direction of committing the general collection of taxation to the officers
of the Crown, instead of the nominees of the parish.”
Toby is an honest dog, and, having yearly paid his tax as such, may
be allowed to blush for his defaulting brethren. . Many of them no
doubt have, for many years evaded the parochial collector, and are
debtors to the State for considerable arrears. Toby has no sympathy
with such dishonest dogs, and he is glad to see that honesty is being
thrust }. them by the aid of the Excise. In the interests of caninity,
Toby wishes that a black list of the men who are convicted, of having
shirked the dog-tax should from time to time be issued, so that would-
be honest dogs may all refuse to live with them. Moreover, Toby
would suggest, if his master, Mr. Punch, will kindly suffer him to do
so, that ºr. collars should be issued for dogs that pay the tax, in
order that all honest dogs may recognise defaulters, and cease to wag a
tail at them when meeting in the street.

in the purchase of the annuity. The plaintiff is surely entitled to have
it known that, the case was a good and just one, and the public, is
interested in knowing that justice has been done upon the Joint
Hereditary Grand Chamberlain. We detest vulgar curiosity, but the
publicity of a legal sentence, which an award under the order of a
Court is, must be desirable for the monition of those who have not yet
imitated LoRD WILLoughby DE EResBy. For which reason Mr. Punch
makes record of an otherwise unedifying matter.

PUNCH, OR THE
THE CELESTIAL HAT.
THE ANGLICAN LIBERTIES.
| PREAghINs about the disestablishment of the Irish Church, the
| Rev. M.R. BELLEw, who approves of that i.f measure, and
| further thinks that, as its consequence, the Church of England must
and should be disestablished too, on the evening of last week's Sunday
bespoke his audience thus:-
“Were there not hundreds of churches, in England supported entirely on the
voluntary principle—his own for instance?, What benefit was the Establishment to
them º. he nor his church received a farthing in the way of endowment.”
There is something in that; and perhaps, if the time for settling the
| British Constitution could come over again, many friends of the Estab-
lished Church would wish it re-established on the voluntary principle.
But MR. BELLEw desires that it should not be established at all. He
went on to say:—
“The Church of England, as an Establishment, had found itself utterly unable
to deal with a heretical bishop, and therefore might as well cease to be an Estab-
| lishment.”
Fair and softly, MR. BELLEw. Wo ho, Sir! Whom do you call
heretical? The 'Bishop of NATAL; if so, DR CoIENso might
| tell you that you’re another. He could say, with justice, that he
holds the Thirty-nine Articles, as much as you do. His biblical criti:
cism may, like the successful Easter-piece at the Olympic, be “all
| my eye and BETTY MARTIN,” and it may be as remote from sound
doctrine as that diverting extravaganza is from tragedy, but, whether
sound or unsound, is out of the question. It is not heretical in the eye
of the law, has never been decided to be by any competent tribunal,
and could only be made so by an er post facto Fortieth Article. Well,
MR. BELIEw, you could perhaps get that, if the Church ceased to be
an Establishment. But, if you could have a. Fºrtieth Article, you
| could also have a Forty First; and Article Forty Two, decreed by
ecclesiastical .. might interdict clergymen from earning
an honest penny by reading Shakspeare, and other profane authors, or
by lecturing upon any secular persons or things for the entertainment
of the public. As it is, the Church of England cannot make new
Articles without the consent of the Legislature, which no doubt is
fortunate for ColeNso, but may be also lucky for you.
Neat.
"You R young friend Wigsby should be a good lawyer,” said SMITH
to RoBINson, “at least he has a large collection of law books, nobly
bound.”, “Sir” said Robinson, “you appear to think that law is
binding.” SMITH has offered a reward for the meaning.
IMPORTANT RAILWAY NEWS. ,
. The past Easter has been marked by the opening of two railways
into, wild and savage Northern districts. One is an extension of the
Highland line, and is called the Sutherland Railway; the other is an
extension of the Metropolitan line, and is called the St. John's Wood
|Railway. Of the former, Mr. Punch means to say nothing until he
shall have Inspected it, but the speeches at the inaugural banquet were
very jolly, especially the Duº or SUTHERLAND's and LoRD Ronald
Gower's (the latter told how a Scotch magistrate, to whom an old
woman called, “O man, stop my coo!” very properly responded that
he was not a man, but a magistrate), and Mr. Punch is rejoiced in any
|improvement, which may spare even a few Highland horses the barbari.
|ties practised upon them in the tourist season—barbarities which
destroy the pleasure of all travellers except the coarser Cockneys and
the British provincials.
| The line which is now open from Baker Street runs through the stern
and frowning wood of Saint John, then takes a district which reminds
one of the glories of Marlborough's Arms, and finally conducts us into
|scenery which, surrounding a famous cottage, may as well be called
Swiss as anything else. Here the rail halts, but it is to be pushed on
to the swarthy moor consecrated by the memory of the patriot, John
| STRAw. Mr. Punch performed the return journey with much ease and
safety, and was not greatly longer, in doing it #. sixpence, than he
would have been in an Atlas omnibus, for threepence. The carriages
are new and luxurious, the stations well built and cheerful, and the
| clerks and porters are, at present, all affable, and indeed encouraging.
The stern “Now, jump in 1" of the Southern district is here exchanged
for the gentl: “As quickly as you please, for our time is up:” and the
snapping “What class P’ is here translated “For which class do you
wºn a ticket?” These holiday amenities are agreeable, but will dis-
appear as business increases upon a much wanted line.
| Mr. Punch, whose hopes, like those of his friend SERIEANT BALLAN-
TYNE, in the boat case, are of great depth, looks sanguinely (that is to
say, with, blood-shot eyes—thanks to the Easter wind) to the develop-
meat of the interesting region which has now been brought within the
range of civilisation. The inhabitants are not ill-conditioned, and some
of them are said to be humane and hospitable, while the spires of more
|than one church show that missionary, effort has been ruccessfully
| directed. Their º: has affinity with that of the Pembridge dis-
tricts, and Bayswater, but, probably owing to insufficient drainage, is
less, guttural. The amusements of the inhabitants are of the dreary
kind usual among savage tribes; they frequently meet at each other's
houses, and voluntarily undergo slow torture, four or more performing
on instruments, and, they will often decoy a lecturer, or other moun-
tebank from a neighbouring, tribe, and reward his imbecile exertions.
They have no history worth, naming, but there linger traditions of a
Great Spirit called the Pine-Apple Ghost, who revealed to one of their
ancestors that a murder had been committed somewhere, but who,
with the usual unpractical habit of apparitions, vanished without leaving
his own address or that of the victim. The Government imposts are
collected without material difficulty in this wild district, though at
times it is necessary to resort to the extreme measure of cutting off the
water, and the Fiery Cross has long, ceased to be carried save in the
form of the Hot Cross of the Good Friday bun. There is no reason
against settling in the region, except that the chiefs to whom the
habitations belong are somewhat exacting, and, any neglect of their
dues involves a demand, not exactly of black mail, but by a very black
looking male, who is, severe about settlers who are unable to settle.
|But much will now be done for their advantage. Mr. Punch adds,
however, that the new railway does not take you from the North to
the Baker Street Station, but to a point at a great distance from it,
and you have to make your way º passages, and down stairs,
for a quarter of a mile or less; and, unless you are athletic and in
training, you arrive. in time to see the red eye of the City carriages
receding into the distant gloom. This part of the business must be
|rectified forthwith, or it will be Mr. Pinch's painful duty to be per-
sistent in warnings which will not help dividends.

A PARLIAMENT OF LADIES’ MEN.
THE great event of last week, next to the PRINCE and PRINCEss of
WALEs's visit to Dublin, was the meeting on the Women's Suffrage
Question at Salford, in the Free Trade Hall, on Wednesday. If it
was not a perfect success, that was º owing to the absence, occa-
sioned unfortunately by a bad cold, of the eldest Miss BRIGHT,
daughter of FRIEND John, M.P. Train up a child in the way she, as
well as he, should go. Also, to have been completely successful, the
meeting should have been honoured with the presence of One who is
not excepting MR, MILL, the greatest philogynist in the world, and
as such would have offered it the suggestion which follows.
The capability of women to choose between political good and evil
| being questioned, let it be tried. Ladies, try it yourselves. On the
basis of universal suffrage, or any other that you may prefer, choose
a Parliament of your own. Though unrecognised as a legislative body,
it will be quite legal—just like Convocation. Indeed, it will exactly
how fit or unfit they are to be intrusted with legislative power.
answer the very purpose which Convocation serves. Convocation
enables us to see what laws the clergy would make if they could, and
our
Parliament of unacknowledged legislators will also, by their debates
and conclusions on the various proposals brought under their consi-
deration, show us what sort of addition you, in your representatives,
might be expected to contribute to the Collective wisdom. And in
the meantime it will perhaps do something more than Convocation
ever does; that is, it may now and then frame some measure so sensible
as to get adopted by the real Parliament, and passed into a law.

ORANGE-1SM IN EXCELSIS.
IF MR. DisbAELI anticipates any difficulty with the Orange lot, Mr.
Punch advises him to send for one M. Agouste, at present engaged
by the Management of the Holborn Circus, but whom the patriotism
of that Establishment would doubtless. induce it to surrender at the
prayer of the Minister. M. Agogste disposes of the Orange Question
in the most miraculous way. In fact, he declines to concede that there
is any question. The Oranges in his hands, or on his heels, or in his
plates, or wherever else he may choose rather to wish than to put them,
obey him with a promptness which suggests volition as well as yolita-
tion. Whether they eddy idly aloft, move gracefully in mid air with the
regularity of the planets, or rotate before him in an endless little chain,
sight is so remarkable, that MR. DiskAFII had better go and see it for
political reasons, and the rest of the public for the sake of beholding a
feat which Mr. Punch hesitates not to declare unique. ... He will add,
while about it, that the Holborn Circus has nearly supplied the loss of
Astley's; and, if the former were dirty instead of clean, and the boxes
were disagreeable instead of comfortable, the charm would be com:
plete. As it is, we must put up with luxury for the sake of a capital
evening. There is a clown, too, who speaks out, and has some, new
jokes, and whose impudent persistence in mischief sends the children

right.

MUSICIANS” LATIN.
MR. Ella, in his “Record of the Musical Union” (cited in the new
announcement of the Handel Festival), has a remarkable quotation.
He observes,
“of Costa, therefore, it may truly be said, Quisque sua fortuna ſaber est.”
Punch has a profound respect for Latin, no matter how introduced
(or with what variation from the received text, as when, in MR.
ELLA's next quotation, he says of Æolus, et temperat, ira); but, as
matter of mere curiosity, he would like to know what, MR. ELLA
thinks the above saying means, and especially, whether he supposes
Quisque to be Latin for Costa? Faber, perhaps, in that case stands for
faba, and no doubt MR. Costa is both a bean and a brick. Would
somebody seek ELLA's bower, and give him this message?
IS IT CORBAN ?
THE Pall Mall Gazette, in a very able article on Establishments, says
“Every Englishman has a right to spiritual services from some given
clergyman.” There is no such thing as a given clergyman, we always
have to pay for him—to say nothing of those collections. Else, we
would not look a gift clergyman in the mouth, unless he were a
Chrysostom.
"Though the veteran Reformer has
withdrawn from his old place of com-
mand, his services in the cause of civil
and religious freedom are such that his
absence from the fore-front of the battle
against the Irish Establishment would
till many minds with deep disquiet. All
the more important is it, therefore, that
their hereditary leader should step for-
ward, and say that he heartily goes with
the younger and bolder men. Coming
from the chief of the aristocratic Whigs,
! such a declaration will have a powerful
effect on the weakkneed Liberals. Nor
can Lord Russell's worst enemies pre-
| tend that he has taken up the question
hastily, or tuat he speaks with the pre-
cipitancy of a convert. From the first

yet another few months of office.”
A POOR LOOK OUT FOR COUNTRY PAUPERS.
ATTENTION has been lately directed to the fact that many of our
poorhouses are far filthier than pigstyes, and that many of our paupers
are far worse housed, and fed, and nursed, and cared for than our pigs.
Respectability, of course, is shocked by the disclosure, and affects to
be astonished that the workhouse inspectors have not disclosed the
evils which the press has dragged to light. But this surprise will not
be shared by those who read the following, from the Pall Mall Gazette:–
“Inspectorships have long been the chosen reward of political friends and
adherents; and the Poor Law Board, in the view of the President, may still with
safety remain the favourite asylum for outdoor pensioners of parties, provided
there be a due annount of codification and regulation, and that everything is pro-
perly bound up in red tape.”
. An overseer has been defined as “one who overlooks;” and an
inspector is a person who does not inspect. When sent to look into a
workhouse, he goes with his eyes blindfolded by routine and red-tape.
| Find fault as little as you can, or you will only bother Us, is the hint
| that he receives from the Poor Law Commissioners. Now, however,
that the matter can no longer be smoothed over, they propose to make
poor union doctors, who are already overworked, responsible for seeing
that the poorhouses are looked to:- *
“It is proposed to shift the responsibility of seeing that the new order of things
to be constituted in the future is maintained, and that the houses are made perfect,
from the Poor Law Board to the overworked and ill-paid medical officers. They are
to inspect themselves, their workhouses, and their guardians, and to make weekly
reports, monthly reports, quarterly reports, to the Board. Already loaded with
work and paid less than postmen or day labourers, exposed to the indignation of
their guardians, and yet making a living almost entirely out of their private prac-
tice amongst these guardians, they are to remonstrate, they are to initiate reforms,
they are to do the work, and inspect the mode of doing the work.”
Who physics poor people should himself be poor, this has long been
the rule in workhouse medical appointments. Guardians like to hire
some poor devil of a doctor, who is fearful to offend them, and whom
they may bully and browbeat as they please. They often get him to
attend their families at half price, and their servants for nothing, on
the threat of cutting down his pittance of a salary, or else of bringing
in a rival to the parish, whose exclusion is the sole cause of the poor
fellow's submission to their terms. How can such a slave speak the
truth about his masters, and, when they neglect their duty, call atten-
tion to the fact? Nevertheless, to make a scapegoat of their surgeon,
and consider him responsible for their own shortcomings, is what the
Poor Law Board would suffer country guardians to do. Punch pro-
tests with all his might against such vile humbuggery, and adds his
weight of influence to what is here proposed :-
“The necessity for an auxiliary corps of medical and technical inspectors is
urgent and plain. It has been granted in London, and with the best effect. There
is no pretence for withholding the same benefit and safeguard from the sick poor in
the country. It is, too, a most cheering fact that the immediate result in London
of the improved management and inspection of workhouses has been an immense
and unexpected saving. The Chairman of the new St. Pancras Board of Guardians,
in his first annual report, just issued, announces that in that workhouse alone,
while profligacy, mismanagement, cruelty, and vice have been placed in check,
while the clothing is better and the dietary improved, the saving has amounted to
no less than £11,090 a-year. What has been done for London must be done for the
country, and by the same means."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES IN DUBLIN,
(By Our Special Irish Correspondent.)
O comply, Sir, with your stipulations, I take up the pen
of Mercury, plucked from the *::: of the pretty little
God of Love, to dip it in the blackest ink-absit omen,
as we used to say at ould Trinity—in order to give you a correct,
luminous, and mighty particular account of the present visit of their
Royal Highnesses to the Emerald Isle...Qn Thursday night, Sir, or as
some of the very early Christians call it Wednesday morning, at five
o'clock (five o’clock!, divil a less, if ye’ll excuse the observation),
when my vally de sham rushed into the chamber where your own
Special lays his weary caput, and says he, in a sort of ecstasy, and
waving a shaving towel like a maniac, says he-
... “Och, glory be!” says he. “'Tis the flate intirely all stayming,
like hot praties, in Doblin Bay.” - - -
“Git out widye, CoRNELius,” says I, addressing him in his own
vernacular, not having forgotten my native tongue during my pro-
tracted residence at Boulogne-sur-Mer, but speaking it with the
least taste in life of a foreign accentuation. “ 8. out wid ye, CoR-
NELIUS them.” says I, “and don’t distorb yer masther in his first
beauty slape,” wherewith I rolled myself round, with my face to the
: as the most delicate hint to the menial to retire, and be blessed
onlm.
“Sure,” continues the baste, yelling with excitement. “What are
ez sent here for, at all at all An’t it to chronicckle the ivints of the
!yle Wist to Doblin, and is it meself that’s to do the wurk for yer
kind implyer, Misther Ponch, and you a snorting in the shates and
blankits there?”
“CoRNELIus,” said I, sitting up majestically in bed, “You leave me
this day month: I warn you.”
“Maybe, thin, ye’ll settle that thrifle o' wages—”
The conversation at this point will scarcely interest the generality of
your readers. The upshot was that I came to an arrangement with
my faithful vally de sham which will be highly satisfactory to you,
inasmuch as you will obtain all the information you require on the
subject, and more than it would be in my power to furnish you with.
All you will have to do is to settle with me.
(From the Observations of CoRNELIUS DELAN.Y.)
5 o'clock, A.M. The Charmel Flate staymed in. Thar worthe Mine-
Otter, the War-ere, the O'Killes, and the Diffense. An’ if they hadn't
binjist nine hars in crassin the charn'l they'd ha’ bin here befur this.
[By a skilful manoeuvre Imanaged to get CoRNELIUs engaged as a
waiter in one place at the Royal repasts, and as an attendant he was
admitted when a man with your own Special's reputation would have
been feared, and the doors closed against him. Being myself busy
upon this visit as part of my future History of Great Britain, I have
left the present account in his hands. He will send you his account
himself by the first post.] - -
The Ryle skooner staymed into the arbour, and all the ships at say
run up flags, and foired sloots. The Ryle party, including some of the
quarries in waitin', didn't same mighty well aſther the say parsage; bot
His Ryle Hoighniss the PRINGE and Har Ryle Hoighniss PRIncess
ARLegsonDERER wor as chairful and brimmin wid good spirts as a keg

an’smoilin' this way an' that as the LoRD LIFTIN’t with the Mashy-
NIss of HAVE-A-CoRN (in such toight boots that it’s meself that don't
wander at the toitle), wid, as somebody said, “his Staff; ” but I sor
nothin' of the sart—not avin a walkin-stick in the LIFTN'T's hand, nor
a bomboo cane. Thin there was the LoRD CHALLENGER, a purty
soight intirely, in his robes and wigs, an’ the Granddear Gyards wid
fixed bagnets, to resave the Ryle Copple on the landin’.
* Long life to yer !” sez I, chairing wid my caubeen this away.
“Be aisy now,” sex the MASHYNIss HAVE-A-corn, pushing me back
contimptuus. Botfier Ryle Hoighniss had cot me oi.
“The heavens be your bed, ARLEGsonDERER!” sex L., “...'Tis yer-
self that’s the Rose o' Denmuk!” With that Her Ryle Hoighniss
nodged the PRINCE, an sex she blushing, in a whispur, “Sure BERTY
dear, 'tis MISTHER CoRNELIUS DE LANY, him as oi’ve minshunned to
yez so arſen.”
Wid that the Good Grayshus PRINCE rases meself from the ground
where I was ginnyflicting on wun knay, and sex he, “Misther, DE
LANY,” sex he, “’tis meself that’s de-loighted to wilcomeyez to these
arts.”
With that I pulled out o' my pocket the pome I’d composed, whin
the LoRD LIFTN'T steps forwurd with an ard-driss.
“Markkis,” sex the PRINCE, “Forst come forst sarved.”
“”Tis manners,” sez I, backin op me fushur Sorvrin. -
k “MISTHER DE LANY will oblige,” sex ARLEGsonDERER, with swate
um nce.
“Ai!” sex I, boshfully, “’tis a thrifle, bot if MISTHER DAN'L

and droms, if he'd jist play the ac-compriment, it moight be som-thin'
grotifyin' to a thriflin' potion of your º Hoighniss's sobjicks.”
With that I song my Ode, which the PRINCE went homming all the
day out, so plased was he with me purr-formance. Afther this, which
left me exharsted on the sile, the PRINCE and PRINcess of WALEs
partook of lonch, an’ were driven through the Phaynix Parruk, accom-
panied by the LoRD LIFTN'T on the Saxe-horn. -
I heard that “The ships on the river were decked with coloured
#. Decked, Sorrl bedad, it must have been pleasant walking
intirely.
There was great chairing and cries of daylight as we passed through
the strates, meself disgeyuised as a liveryman, up behoind the car, and
clearly among all the chairs of the poplace I heard with proide, “More
power to your elbow, CoRNY DELANY. Shure 'tis himself’s the boy
to wroite for Misther Ponch.”
I bloshed, Sorr, but recovered, and bowed with the utmost poloite-
ness. More in nextht.
The races wor at Ponchestown in honour of your own Special.
SINGULAR INCIDENT.
WE really didn’t mean it, and if we ever begged pardon we’d do it
now, but a Roysterer (who subsequently and at our expense showed
himself an Oysterer) rushed in and defied us to give him a Shaksperian
quotation applicable to SIR BRook BRIDGEs having been made Lord
FITzwater. How could we help saying with Don Pedro –
“What need the bridge much broadcrthan the flood 2"
But the Roysterer, who is noisy but not clever, did not see it.
“Why," says we, in a rage at his stupidity and his voraciousness
with the bivalves, “if the bridge is the right size it fits the water,
don't it, hass?” He swallowed eleven oysters before he could speak
again.
“An Excellent Piece of Principality.”
IRELAND, whose sons are born poets, prettily presented the PRINcess
of WALEs with an Irish Dove. Wales, not to be behind-hand, had
prepared as a gift, a Welsh Rabbit, but it was clandestinely devoured
by one of the “Bards,” who was unfortunately born too late to come
under the police arrangement of Edward THE FIRST.
One Letter Different.
A New word might be introduced to express the whole art and
mystery of Croquet-Croquetry. The objection, perhaps, to this neo-
logism is, that people might confound it with Coquetry, with which
reprehensible diversion the game can, of course, have no possible
connection.

to play billiards, and drink beer; but lots of girls do that without

lots of girls are fond of it, and would die to go in training for a match

GOLDEN GOOSE KILLING AT CHESTER.
“”TIs N'T every day,” say the agriculturists of Hampshire, prover-
bially speaking, “that we kill a pig.”. So, perhaps, the Portsmouth
lodging-house and hotel-keepers, in the language of their county,
thought to themselves when they stuck it into the people who came to
see the Volunteer Review. It is not everyday that they get such a
ig as the sight-seeing British Public to kill. Therefore, when they
#. get hold of that sort of pig, if they kill it, and eat it up, from snout
to tail, pettitoes and all, they do not act otherwise than, with that
enlightened selfishness which is said to be the basis of all goodness.
They are wise in their generation—but some other_persons are other-
wise. Let Angus, sporting correspondent of the Morning Post, amuse
you with an illustration of the unwisdom of those other persons:–
“MR. W. E. Jones, one of the most respected members of the Ring, has done
| such good service to the Turf that it is fit it should be recognised. I have often in
these letters called attention to the extravagant charges to which racing men are
subject, and showed how Doncaster, Northampton, Chester, and other places, had
killed the golden goose by driving people away on account of the way they skinned
them.”
The goose that regularly lays golden eggs, you will observe, is a
very different creature from the occasional and fortuitous pig. To kill
the pig is all very well, but killing the goose is most injudicious, and
| indeed suicidal. A goose appears to have been thus effectually killed
| the other day at Chester :—
“MR. Jon Es, it seems, having made up his mind to go to Chester for the races,
| and wishing to enjoy the comforts of an inn, wrote to a well-known hotel to know
their terms for a sitting-room and bed-room for the four days during which the
meeting lasted. To his communication he received a reply, stating that he could
have the accommodation he wanted, but that each person who came into his sitting-
room must pay one guinea per diem for that room, as well as that sum for his bed-
| room, and eighteenpence a-day for servants.”

It was a sudden thought, but a good one, for his purpose. The horse
was cantering on at an even pace, making the circuit of the common

execution of his rapidly conceived design.
He tore off his coat, waistcoat, and hat, while the horse was still in

beneath the other two.

to see the glitteringspangles of the Sungod's costume. “It is enough if

follows:–
“MR. Jones, of course, declined these terms, as he conjectured the meals would
be handicapped on the same terms, so he forwarded the letter to the sportsman, in
which newspaper it was published, and as other sporting papers have copied the
communication, the establishment in question has got an advertisement for which
they would rather not have bargained, although it was a gratuitous one.”
In sending the letter which he had received from the chrysocheno-
phonous innkeeper to the Sportsman, MR. Jones proved himself a very
valuable contributor to a sporting paper. *There is no better sport, in
the opinion of Mr. Punch, than to see an attempt at over-reaching

MR. E. J. REED, who makes ships, is habitually wigged in the Stan-

than any of his critics could do, and that he does not care for any
attack. He then likens himself to NARCIssus, and says that his foes
“are free to pine away into a sound with hating him.” Good; we like
pluck. But does NARCIssus REED recollect how Echo was avenged?
The cruel Fitzger HIssus was condemned to see his own face in a
fountain—some MSS. read a wet dock—and to admire his own perfec-
tions until he collapsed. What says NARcissus REED to that?

have been to that now brimless battered hat as it ...ſº over the
moonlit plain which reached for miles in the basin naturally formed by
the perpetual landslips, and the overshading pine hills surrounding it.
He would not shout, he would not cry for assistance: Onward he
hurried. One moment with extended arms to seize the receding form,
another prone upon the uneven soil, then with his short curly hair
streaming behind him in the breeze, he flew across the open plain.

A distant murmur fell upon his ear. Louder, louder, the voices of a
myriad deep-tongued monsters baying for a victim.
“The Seal” he cried in terror. “It is the sea!”
Lucid, two-horned, antler-bearing, changeable, vague, wandering,
nightly, continuous by night, silent, tacit, smiled the daughter of

* Notes.—The Authors who looked over this description of the ocean erased this
description of the moon shining on the sea, and described the fact simply in five
words. On an early copy being sent to them for perusal, they find the Editor has
restored the passage. Why?—(Sigmed.)
Editor.—Gentlemen, you are only three out of the number, why did you erase
the passage aforesaid? It was written by a scholar and a poet, the Author, in fact,
to whom was J. that he should write a song in this on the first opportu-
nity; failing this, that he should be allowed to indulge in poetic licence. He is a
scholar and gentleman, and retains his classic knowledge. He was brought up at
Eton and Oxford. A touch here and there gives elegance. I beg the subject may
be dropped.
The Authors, the three above-named with others, to the Editor.—Sir, We did not state
our reasons, but will. Scholar ! pooh l—no more scholar than-well, never mind.
“Retained his classic knowledge,” you say: you mean, Sir, retained his old school
books, and makes the barest extracts from them, which are to pass for cultivated
scholarship. He was with us, you may recollect, in the country (the humbug I he
pretended he must be away in the country to get inspiration () and we coming
upon him unexpectedly found him writing his portion of this work with an old
copy of the Gradus ad Parnassum before him, open at the article.LUNA, to which
pray refer, and you will find all his epithets in the original Latin Lucida, bicornis,
corneoera,” &c., &c. Then turn to article NEPTUNus, and in the very first line you
will find this gentleman's paraphrase word for word. Now, Sir, if we dealt thus with
you and the public, what would you, what would they say? It was this impostor
then who wrote those Latin º Greek headings to the Chapters, eh? Gross igno-
rance, Sir, gross. Again, Sir, as to the heading to Chapter XIV., any schoolbo

of this.
Editor to the Above.—Gentlemen, the Editor has been imposed upon. The Classic
Poet is no longer connected with this Company. The passages complained of were
allowed (the Editor is willing to explain how) to remain at the wish of the Directors,
upon whom the Musical Poet had called to sing some of his compositions for this
work. The Editor always thought him a detestable humbug, but does not shrink from
admitting that the epithets were admitted as a compromise, so that the Directors
and Editor might not in future be obliged to listen to his singing every day, and at
every hour between ten and four. However, he has received a certain amount for
his shares, and has retired; and now, Gentlemen, the Editor takes the present
opportunity of expressing a strong hope that the good feeling and forbearance, and
gentlemanly tone of all concerned will prevent any contretemps occurring, just when
the work is progressing so admirably.

His pace had brought him impetuously to the very verge of the
abrupt cliff, when from the door of the cottage a female form issued,
and, throwing herself across the object
of his pursuit prevented ...its, being
carried forcibly over into the boiling
waves beneath.
The first ray of morning light fell on
their faces.
The woman raised her arms and
screamed. She would have fallen over
the cliff had not DoRNTON caught her
in his arms.
“BEss! look up ! speak to me!”
he cried in an agony.
He knew she had recognised him,
but at that moment, yielding to as
irresistible an impulse as that which
urged the Grecian Matron Hubardé to
make osteological search within the
closed recess, or the wary Pimannos
to entrap the yielding , and simple
Simonides on his road to the Athe:
nian Fair, or the impulsive Hornerus to dare P. dangers *
in extracting the solitary fruit of , the Plumm-bearing tree, -
he pressed his hot lips to her icy cold forehead, and felt such a
thrill of pleasure shudder-
ing through his frame as
threatened to render his
position upon that un-
guarded ledge every se-
cond more dangerous, .
He had not noticed it,
but by a coincidence he
had stopped on the exact
spot where some days
before , he had dropped
the white cravat over the
edge of the cliff, and it
had remained there flut-
* in the breeze.
“You are in my power
now,” he whispered, with
concentrated passion in
- her ear. “Come! your
- father is dying; I
he will consent; let the past be forgotten. Come! Come!”
He seized her round the waist, but her voice returning, she uttered
a piercing shriek, which was suddenly answered from below.
DoRNToN paused. He was a bold bad man, but even bold, bad men
must pause sometimes. The time had come for him.
* The Editor, in answer to numerous queries from the Authors, has great plea-
sure in announcing that these elegant interpolations, so happily illustrating the
situation, are from the pen of the celebrated Authoress who has recently joined this
Novel Company. (Limited). . The Editor is sure, that the esteemed member of the
Company, the author of the White Ram, &c., will be the last person to find fault
with the style of the hand which has produced Canaries of Supplication, Shalotte's
Inheritance, Blabbington Black's Forgery. -

“It is Joseph,” cried the poor girl. “He has heard me, and comes
to my assistance.”
“Bah!” laughed, DoRNToN, savagely, “he is two hundred feet
below the level of the sea, your chick- -
weed-gathering lover; twill be dusk ſº
again ere he reach us. You are mine ! -
Nay, pretty one, do not struggle.”
But he had to exert all his force, for
Bess, accustomed to row her father's
smack of sevent -eight tons, could put
out more than the ordinary strength of
a woman. But she was hardly a match
for PIEL DoRNToN, who lifting his now
unresisting burthen far above his head,
was offering her his love or instant
destruction, which two steps forward
would have accomplished, when a hand -
apparently issuing from the earth,
grasped him firmly round the ancle. -
The Horse.—He was walking in the last num-
ber, but as it gives more life to the picture by
introducing a horse, the Editor ventured to put
him on horseback. It'll go so much better. -

Derwentwater estates, where he had joined Wordsworth, always fond
of an “Excursion,” Lamb, Sheil, curiously enough at that time Master

the inventor, on his marriage with Kitty Clive—which were wet after
a long walk across the Plains of Abraham, the party sat down to a
rubber, Whiston cutting in without, any controversy with Mulready,

man that he had seen him at the Rugby Station with Usher, earnestly

SOME MISUNDERSTANDING.
MR. Punch has been surprised by receiving the following infor-
mation from a distinguished physician :-
“SIR,-At page 136 of your current volume you describe me as a prig and a
humbug.”
The letter thus commencing is signed JAMEs EDMUNDs, M.D.” Mr.
Punch never applied, or ever dreamt of applying, the terms Prig and
Humbug to Dr. JAMEs EDMUNDs. On reference it will be found that
those are merely the words of an angry smoker in a dialogue, who is
inveighing against an Association which he dislikes—the Anti-Tobacco
Society—in the mass. A preceding enumeration of persons advertised to
attend a meeting of that body happens to include the name of a DR.
EDMUNDs, who, for aught Mr. Punch knew, might have been a Doctor
of Laws, or Divinity. He had not the least idea that Dr. JAMEs
EDMUNDs was a Member of the Anti-Tobacco Society, and is by no
means sure that he is now. DR. JAMEs EDMUNDs writes especially in
the character of Honorary Secretary to the Female Medical Society.
That is quite another thing. Has he actually read what he complains
of, or has he been misinformed?
“When he Stamped, Sir, I Stamped.”

THE “Great Tichbourne Case,” as it is called, has been introduced

fellows without are kept well aware that they are dieted on the former
and not on the latter. A clause should be introduced into the Capital
Punishments within Prisons Bill providing a limited number of select
ruffians with the accommodation requisite #. enabling them to witness
the execution of any one of their order whom it may be necessary to
hang for murder. Due provision should likewise be made to give
parties of the same class opportunities for witnessing such instructive
exhibitions as the one described by the Chester Chronicle under the head
of “Flogging Garotters.” Another spectacle of a different nature was
going on hard by:—
"At the time when a joyous crowd of people were collecting about the Chester
Railway Station for the purpose of witnessing the arrival of and showing their
loyalty to the PRINCE and PRINCEssor WALEs, two fellows confined in the castle
were writhing under the infliction of the cat-o'-nine tails for robbery.”
Is it too much to say that the crowd collected about the railway
doubtless included some persons whose more suitable place would have
been among the spectators of the scene that was then proceeding in the
Castle, narrated as follows f–
“The prisoners, HART and CookE, were taken from their cells to one of the
prison yards about half-past six. HART, who is only eighteen, was the first to
undergo the punishment awarded to him, viz., fifteen lashes. So terrified did he
become at the preparations that while he was being fastened to the triangle he
cried. At the first blow he shrieked loudly, and continued to shout and clutch the
st to which he was fastened until the full number of strokes had been dealt.

It is of no use making agarotter howl unless he is heard, and heard by
those who will be instructed by his howling. Revenge is unchristian;
but Society, like individuals, may, try to make enemies repent, if,
indeed, it is not our duty to try as hard as ever we can... On the prin.
ciple of loving-kindness, let garotters be shampooed, if shampooing
will tend to stop garotting; but, as flogging is found rather to do so,
flog them. Don't inflict a pang upon the worst of ruffians, except to
the end of deterring other ruffians from cruelty. Spare not the lash
in any degree to effect that end. But then let the pangs of the

wasted; his howlings and writhings thrown away: let them always
have the proper witnesses: all the other rascals in prison, and as large
a number as may be convenient of outside blackguards privileged with

A KICK AT THE CANCAN.
ENGLAND boasts its hornpipe, Scotland its reel, and Ireland its jig.
But what, except the cancan, is the Frenchman's national dance? %
ask, because we notice that a writer in a Paris newspaper is savagely
indignant on this tender point:-

UR contemporary the Spectator says, in re.
ference to MR. DiskAELI's assumption of
terror lest our religion should be in
danger:-
“It were better to have MR. WHALLEY for
Prime Minister, for he at least would not say
these things without honestly believing them.
But bad as it would be to have a fool for Prime
Minister of England, is it not worse to have one
who, not being a fool himself, but very much
the reverse, addresses himself,” &c.
Mr. Punch is never so outspoken as
this. When he wishes to intimate his
belief in the non-wisdom of folks, he says
with the Shakspearian lady–
“I do not call them fools, but this I think,
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have
drink.”
But he would like to know what the
sapient electors of Peterborough say to
the above label, so neatly gummed on
their representative.

CHAPTER XVIII.
THE HAND OF FATE.
THE towering Atlantic wave, whose dizzy height only those who
have once surmounted it to gaze upon the lake-like valley beneath, can
possibly imagine, seized the devoted house with the hand of a giant,
and twirled it into the air, as NUTT had often done with his hat for
GRACE MARCHMONT's evening amusement..., For one instant she clung
to him, but in the next, relaxing her hold, she, with true feminine
instinct ...iſ that her watch, which played two tunes and struck
the quarters, would be most useful, to her on some future occasion,
wound it up rapidly, securing it tightly by the chain to her waist, and
then as her maiden blood rose to her cheeks, pressed both hands
firmly upon the skirts of her dress. So she awaited her fate.
NUTT's one thought at that moment was for her.
The huge wave gathering itself together like a concrete sea-wall
careering on the face of the qcean at a rate too fearful for contempla-
tion, began to quiver beneath its own immensity as though trembling
under the consciousness of its murderous work.
Ah! how little do we, sitting by our comfortable firesides, realise
such dangers as these ; and, after all, how small, how little, does this
mighty work of nature seem when told on ſpaper. And what is it?
A man, and woman by themselves unaided, save by their own intelli-
gence, left to battle with a vast Atlantic wave.
wave only, but one which had rolled itself from one ocean to another,
which had glided stealthily round the world's four corners into the
broad ocean highway,+a double horror, a multiplied power, an Atlan-
tic wave in the Pacific.
The wild wind was, its master, driving it onward in the dark night.
It sucked in the smaller fish at its base and heaved them up to the top.
Some of these NUTT was enabled to catch and place in his pockets.
“She,” he said to himself, “likes fish.”
What tables and chairs he could reach at the moment, he attempted,
somewhat unwisely, to seize and secrete about his person, as they were
forced through the house window by inner pressure. As he did so he
thought to himself how the time might come when she would be glad
to sit down, upon something, and then he would provide the means.
Would she be touched at last P Would she at length understand him
and read his heart?
A sharp cry from her attracted his attention, but the night was too
dark for him to be º: to her, by anything except her voice.
He stretched out hişºarms, and leant, as he imagined, in her direction.
This action had unforeseen consequences.
The sudden weight, so, slight in itself, thus brought to bear more
upon one side than the other, destroyed the equilibrium of the already
tottering sea-wall, and shaking for one second as if the course of its
fall were still uncertain, it toppled headlong and fell with one great
gigantic ruin, and then the sea was calm and tranquil, and the moon
shone out as upon a peaceful valley. -
GRAge awaking from her stupor, found herself upon dry land. She
pressed her hand to her side.
“My watch thank heaven!” was her first exclamation.
The next instant she thought of the Boomerang.
Yes, where was NUTT *
And the House?
GonE. -
And not an Atlantic like
She uttered a loud cry. She shouted his name, there was no re-
sponse. She was on an unknown sea-shore, alone.
Then the roof of the house in which they had suffered so much
together drifted in on the tide. In its wake, floated a few notes of the
old piano from the lower b to the upper c, reminding her of many
happy hours in her Benician home past and gone. - -
hen she had recourse to true feminine relief: she cried. This was
a relief to her. After a while she began to ask herself what he would
have done had Providence willed him to be in her place then.
She came to the conclusion that her best course was a careful search.
This led her to the southern extremity of the island, for she had nº
doubt it was an island, from seeing water entirely surrounding it, and
here she began her work in real earnest. . - - -
A magnificent growth of trees of all sizes and descriptions covered
the cliff down to the sea's edge; it had all the appearance of a carefully
preserved and well timbered park, so bountiful had nature been in this
respect, and so careful of her bounties.
ith a faltering step she approached the confines of the park, and
uttered Nutt's name. There was no response; but as she neared the
º tree in the plantation a vague sense of heat well nigh overcame
er.
“You are getting warm,” said a well-known voice, in tones of deepest
anxiety, not two yards distant from her.
“I am,” she murmured faintly, “burning,” and she stretched out
her hand. -
In another moment NUTT's strong grasp, as he stepped from behind
a large trunk, prevented her falling to the earth. .
gº É. me,” he said to her, almost apologetically, “I had but
just awoke from a deep sleep, and seeing you approach, my first idea
was to recall to your mind the light days of innocent childhood's
pleasures, and to conceal myself behind yonder broad-shouldered pine.”
“It was scarcely fair,” she replied feebly, but with returning
strength. “You should have cried ‘hoop,' or something to, that
effect. At first I thought you lost,” and the delicate form, 5 uddered.
Ah! what Heaven was this to him He would have had her always
shuddering, for that one thrill of strong excitement had, set his
veins on fire, and made his hair stand out rigid in the last red light of
the glorious sun. - - - -
“Come,” said he, playfully, “no more games: it is, getting late,
and this is our first evening in our new quarters. We have much to
do. What say you, Miss MARCHMONT, shall we name this group of
trees, Seek Plantation?” -
She answered him with an angelic smile, “Call it rather Hide Park.”
“Be it so,” returned NUTT, “and now to provide for our evening
meal, for nothing is left us from the wreck of the old house.” -
“Except a few bon-bon crackers,” said GRACE, who had by this
time regained her usual composure.
NUTT pondered for a few seconds, then he answered.
“No,” he said. “There is not enough in one at a time for a single
meal, and 1 doubt whether in this new climate the saccharine compo-
sitions would agree with us. Let us keep them as luxuries, and per-
haps I can find a better use for them hereafter.”
.." Why mayn't I eat them now ** she asked pettishly, “I shall, if I
Nutt regarded her in silent, loving, despondency, Who was this
strange being who had so enthralled him? as this the return for all
his untiring patience, his unflagging zeal in her behalf
She looked up. “Forgive me,” she said, smiling. Forgive her!
there was nothing to forgive. So he put the bonbons in his own
pocket, and told her that he had, a good use in store for them which
she should soon know, and satisfied with this assurance she put no
further questions. -
The sun had gone below the horizon, and º later in these
southern parts than elsewhere, was coming on slowly but surely.
GRAce looked at her watch. It played a tune and struck the
quarters.
BEDTIME.
From the Authors at work upon the PIEL DoRNToN portion of the Tale to the Editor-
Sir, Why is this favouritism : Why do you allow the Artistic Staff (which seems
| reduced to a Power of One) to illustrate only the other, and we may say secondary
| part of this work, upon which we are not engaged, of which we do not in its extent
entirely approve, and to which you are, it appears, inclined to attach undue impºr-
tance? Why has there never been a picture of PIEL DoRNToN ? Why not of the
thrilling events in Chapters XVI. and XVII., and why was our portion of the story to
be filled up with pictures of the Boomerang? We know, because we assisted at the
plot, who the Boomerangis, and will turn out to be: , (If he does not turn out to be
what he was arranged to eventuate in, we shall withdraw and bring an action for
obtaining—But this will be a matter for our Solicitor's consideration.) But we
must strongly object to luis appearance in the PIEl DoRNTON Preserves. Yours,
The Seven Authors engaged upon this. Signed.
Editor to the Seven Authors.-Gentlemen, Your PIEL DoRNton part is so graphic
as to need no illustration, and the reason why the Boomerang, pictures were intro-
duced was because the Editor was afraid lest in the perusal of your exciting story
the public attention should be entirely withdrawn from the other part. . At the
same time, as the Editor is bound to publish all notes in connection with this work,
he wishes to say that there is No Favouritism. That the Editor is equally pleased
with all the Authors, and also with the amiable and indefatigable Artist; and he
does sincerely hope that the good feeling and forbearance, and gentlemanly tone of
all concerned, will prevent any contretemps occurring just when the Work is pro-
gressing so admirably.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHAPTER XIX.
THE IRON AGE.
NUTT, whose whole appearance,” to the astonishment of Miss
MARCHMONT, had º lost all its Boomerang character, divined
her thoughts at once. “You shall have, before nightfall,” he said,
“a house worthy of Hide Park, and,” he added, after surveying the
island for a few seconds, apparently calculating its internal resources,
“every luxury which modern improvements furnish, or the dross of
unbounded wealth can purchase.”
She watched him in tearful admiration; she devoured him with her
eyes. He was so strong, so good, so persevering.
“Now, make haste,” she said to him, sharply, “and don't stand
gaping there all day.”
This inuendo cut him to the quick, but he felt it was deserved, and
so he determined to be inactive no longer. -
He plunged into the thicket, and almost instantly returned with an
enormous tree. -
“What on earth are you going to do with that?” was her question.
“This,” he answered, “will be your house. Miss MARCHMONT, we
are indeed fortunate. This is the Plant of the Entire Building. The
trunk is in four, compartments, and nature has herself made the stair-
case in a rough and rugged way, only omitting banisters and stair-
carpets, which we can easily add. We have but to fix this firmly in the
ground, and more than half our work is accomplished.”
“Stay !” she exclaimed.. “Have I not seen at home printed offers
for selling an Entire Plant for Building or Manufacturing Purposes?”
He nodded assent. “Why,” she continued, with her eyes widely
opening at the vastness of the idea, “I have seen as much as £100,000
offered for such a Plant.” - - - -
“You have,” said NUTT, “this is it; we are indeed in luck.”
He laboured on for half an hour, and had then only got the first
floor finished. He stopped for a few moments to gain encouragement
from her smile and wipe the perspiration from his own brow. She
was thoughtful. -
“I must help you,” she said, presently. “If I could only twist
the sand on the sea-shore into bell-ropes—or-or-oh, dear, what can
I do? It will kill me to sit idle.” -
This was a good healthy sign, and NUTT would not discourage her.
“Well,” he said at length, “you can go down to the shore an
obtain some of that white and red sea-weed; when dried it will make
admirable ornaments for the fire-stoves.”
She rose quickly, but as suddenly stopped, and looked downwards.
She had on only the very thinnest white satin shoes, having been in
full evening dress when the fierce Atlantic wave had swept them on
their new career. - - -
“Your poor feet!” he said, tenderly, but with a puzzled air, for he
himself was without boots of any sort. - -
She leant against a small tree, in thought... It bent with her weight
and she jumped away from it, fearing that it was about to break, but
on her removing the pressure the tree sprang up again into its original
Ce.
She pointed this out to NUTT, who ran to examine the phenomenon.
The next instant she saw him raising his hands and shouting like a
Inaulac.
“What is it f" she inquired.
“This, Miss MARCHMONT,” said NUTT, as quietly as his excitement
would permit, “is indeed a most opportune discovery. Without it
we should have had to undergo much suffering; with it we are at Qnce
upon our road to comparative ease and luxury even here. The damp
of the marsh, the flints of the beach, the unpleasant, moisture of the
sands we may, by the aid of this natural provision, alike defy. This is
the celebrated Boot-TREE.”
“I have often heard my poor uncle mention it,” she said, and a
shade of melancholy passed over both their faces, as they remembered
the deceased Lieutenant, and thought how fond he would have been of
the Boot-tree had he been still alive. Then they came to action.
“Let me take the measure of your foot with this leaf. Thank you.
i.ºthe shade. Now,” said NUTT, “in another moment you will be
t ->
He gained the top by means of short stunted branches, and selecting
the strongest and best small pair from the uppermost boughs, de-
scended triumphantly with them in his hand. “It is the Spring
º: ºf year,” he said, “and therefore these early boots have elastic
sides.”
“I’m sorry to hurt your feelings, MR. NUTT,” she said, when after
#: §ne on it had been found to fit admirably, “but they are both
rights.
* “Whole appearance" was substituted by the Editor iu lieu of “Face, form,
features, hands, feet, legs,” &c., which you gentlemen had seen fit to foist into
this portion of the narrative. This is an answer to the Authors' query. See Illustra-
tion labelled “Omega" in last week's number.—Ba.
From Authors to Editor.—Sir, Those pictures of the Boomerang only partially
represent our idea of the Boomerang. à." heavens ! Sir I we all went and explained
our meaning to M.R. MALALEIL one morning. He said he understood it when we
left him. He never gave us any luncheon, nor offered us anything to drink.
“The rights of woman,” said NUTT, playfully; “but,” he added,
seeing that she looked serious, “There is one left,” and he went up
aloſt again to fetch it, returning as before.
Armed with these she descended to the sea-shore, while NUTT cut
down a few oaks, and having concocted a sort of putty with some
earth moistened by the early dew, he commenced soldering the walls
together, so as to keep out the draught. His next difficulty was
the stair-carpets, and then the door-bell. This last nearly staggered
him. , While he was meditating this new difficulty, he thought he
heard his name called, and looking round sharply, saw nothing. He
was certain he heard it repeated feebly. He ran to the edge of the cliff
as quickly as he could, for his new boots (he also had plucked a pair
of a shinier and harder kind) pinched him sadly, and 1.É. down, he
saw what made his blood stagnate with horror, and recede from his
thumping heart.
(The Editor is bound by agreement to publish all notes, &c.)
Thirteen Authors engaged on the Grace and Boomerang Department. To Editor—
Why didn't you publish our letter to you last week? Publish it.
This is not the way to talk to an Editor. I don't like it. Alter your tone.—Ed.
Sent to Authors aforesaid.
From Directors to Editor.—We have been appealed to by Thirteen Authors. Pray
comply with their request.
Bditor to Directors.-Gentlemen, In accordance with your calm and temperate
letter, I will, in this Number.
Bditor to Authors.-The Directors wish your letter published. It was an accident
that it was not done before. Everything that your Editor can do to forward your
views for the general good shall be done; but do not let there be a feeling of bitter-
ness springing up specially towards your Editor, who would not hurt a fly. And,
Gentlemen, you should be above underhand reprisals. The Editor with pain alludes
to the hamper sent to his Office, labelled Game, and which contained nothing but
liye frogs. The powdered sugar was fortunately given to the Office boy to put in
his tea, and was not used by the Editor in whiskey-and-water as advised. It blew
the boy's teacup into atoms, and the spoon struck him a severe blow in the eye.
This is not revenge; and if it were, would be unworthy of you. One of the Gentle-
men engaged upon the PIEl DoRNToN part of this Work, informs me that you've
threatened him with a booby trap if Le calls upon any one of you. Now, Gentlemen,
under the circumstances I will publish your ſ: if you still desire it. But the
Editor feels sure that by the time it appears you will have reconsidered its terms,
and will thank the Editor, with tears in your eyes, for his gentle forethought and
calm advice. The Editor knows that you are all—Authors and Artists alike—good,
kind-hearted fellows at bottom, and that these little differences do but arise from
various views of Art, accidental to the essence of Individual Genius. We shall go
very evenly to work in future; equal chapters being given to each set. And now,
Gentlemen, the Editor [The Editor was just winding up this address at
the moment of going to press, when the following communication arrived:]
From the Thirteen Authors.-Just read proofs. Ours is the part of the story.
From the Seven.—Seen the proof of next. Good gracious ! Why don't you con-
dense their part? Stick to Piel DoRNrox. You know the plot was settled on paper
briefly thus:-
“BoomERANG and GRACE should be wrecked out of their House, and should be
immediately—" [The Editor cannot publish the remainder of this, as it reveals
the future plot]—and these fellows, the Geologist, the Naturalists, the Ornitho-
logists, and the Artist on your staff are just following out their own fancies, regard-
less of the plot at all. Stop it at once, or we'll withdraw, and bring out a new
Novel, called “The Captives of Corcyra," and ruin you.
We are only seven in number, and the others are thirteen. Literary men and
Editors fight for less in Paris. We are determined, if we feel the necessity, to call
them all out, and commence with you, Sir, as Editor. Six of ws will fight, and six
will be seconds; the seventh is a Doctor. (Signed, the Scwen.)
Editor to the above, suddenly received.—There is no time to reply. Must publish
the notes. I know I am bound to do so. But you are joking. I see you are joking.
Come, come, I 'm as foud-I mean the Editor is as fond of a bit of fun as you are,
and he enjoys the joke, only dou't push it any further, and let us all dine together
with the Directors at Greenwich. Whitebait just in, small and fresh. There, name
your day; and now, Gentlemen, the Editor, in closing this correspondence, is sure
that he may invariably depend upon the good feeling, the forbearance, and the
gentlemanly tone of all concerned, to prevent any contretenps occurring just when
the ...; well written in all parts, and admirably illustrated, is progressing so
favourably. * -- - - -
GOOD NEWS FROM PARAGUAY.
THE tidings from Paraguay are exceedingly interesting and impor-
tant, and although, from the peculiar mode in which South Americans
of opposite parties forward intelligence, we are perfectly uncertain
whether Brazil has demolished Paraguay, or Paraguay has exterminated
Brazil, or there has been any fight at all, the news which comes from
such a distance and in so many ships must command respect. Further-
more, there is one bit of intelligence which must make the English
heart beat pleasantly. Iron-clads, supplied by British Merchants,
have proved to be honest, seaworthy articles...This advance in com:
mercial morality is to be hailed with joy, and pride, and we rejoice and
are proud j Whatever may be said of Marine Assurance,
in shipbuilding we believe that honesty is the best Policy.
Our Fair Flesh and Blood.
We are indebted to the Pall Mall Gazette for making us aware that
one of the Speakeresses at the Manchester Suffrage Meeting spoke of
being “heavily weighted by Nature.” Do ladies who are a trifle too
emboupoint (that, we believe, is the correct word in fiction) expect that
the Franchise, when they get it, amongst other marvellous charms,
will make them thin so, there will be an end to the stout resist-
ance, which they seem disposed to make to the many grievances of
which they are the pitiable victims.

AS SCUMMLES'S PICTURES ARE INVARIABLY “SKYED' AT THE

AN ABYSSINIAN EXHIBITION.
The cost, of the Abyssinian war is a matter of no consequence whatever to the nation at
large, as it has been imposed wholly on the payers of Income Tax. Still, these persons, made
to pay for fighting their country's battles, constitute a minority of the population which is
large enough to be not altogether contemptible. If Government could, without any expense to
the masses, recoup the victims of confiscation, it might as well, for it would do so with perfect
safety from clamour. Now the CHANCELLOR or THE Exchique R will be enabled to make
restitution of conscience-money on the part of Government to the sufferers of partial taxation
with perfect convenience to the people at large if SIR Robert NAPIER succeeds in capturin
KING, Theodorp., His Majesty the Negus may possess, no treasury, the contents of whic
would serve to indemnify the British Income-Tax }*; but is not so extraordinary a poten-
tate as the Abyssinian tyrant a treasure in himself f : First catch your NEGUs, of course; but,
having caught him, bring him away and constitute him an exhibition. In so doing there would
be no need to keep him in a cage or den; he
might be made perfectly comfortable, only
open to... public inspection during certain
hours daily at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly,
or some other place equally commodious.
Admission on five days out of the six (on
Sundays Theodore being a Christian would
even if instructive exhibitions were allowe
to be open, of course have leave to attend
to his devotions) might be one shilling, the
sixth day being a half-crown day, for the ac-
commodation of the superior classes. After
having been shown in London as long as he
continued to be sufficiently attractive, he
might be conveyed throughout the rest of
the United Kingdom, and afford a spectacle
to the inhabitants of Edinburgh, Dublin,
and the various provincial towns. Then, if
the State had not made enough money by
him to replace the amount which he has oc-
casioned it to exact from a single class, he
could be sent abroad to fetch more, travel-
ling, not necessarily in a van, all over the
Continent, and doubtless, drawing contri-
butions in abundance towards obtaining
income equivalent to what he has cost that
section of the people who have had exclu-
sively the honour of paying for the expe-
dition against him.
THE MODERN INQUISITION.
PERHAPs, the PREMIER, who has now got
to make a Bishop of HEREFoRD, will write
one more letter, and satisfy the British Booby
on the subject of “MR. DisrAELI's religion,”
which appears to afflict divers. Scarcely a
day passes but some new º imper-
tinence, or some particularly unnecessary
information is tossed out. R. Dish AELI
knows that Punch has not refrained from a
great lot of good-natured allusions to the
nationality of which the former is so justly
ſº." and it is possible that we , may
ave many another cartoon of which he
will be the smiling or scowling hero. But
we protest—and we are as good a Protes-
tant as MR HARDy—against sneaking into
a gentleman's study, and taking notes as
to whether Prayer Book, Missal, WATTs's
Hymns, Koran, or Shaster, be most thumbed,
and publishing inferences. We do not see
whose business it was to announce that MR.
DisrAELI had no particular religion until
he was five, and that he was then taken by
SAMUEL Rogers to Hackney Church, espe-
cially as we believe the latter statement to
be false, MR. Rogers and his father having
been regular attendants at the Unitarian
Qhapel at Hackney, of which the celebrated
DR. PRICE was, in older days, Minister.
Nor do we see why the pastor of Hughen-
den should gratify vulgar curiosity by pro-
claiming that the PREMIER has been a
º: Church-goer for seventeen years,
and was a Communicant at Easter. Is this
England, or America?. We do not habitu-
ally admire French legislation, but the late
edict against ransacking Private Life is not
without its merits. Somebody will be askin
about our religion next, and will need
his own to bear the consequences.
A Dangerous Gift.
THE last possessor of the watch, which
was the cause of BARRINGTON, the Pick-
pocket, being transported, has bequeathed it
to the South Kensington Museum. Curiosi-
ties of this sort, give so much delight to
visitors, that, not improbably the watch in
question will send some one into a transport
a second time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FEMALE SELF-EMANCIPATION.
EAR MR. PUNCH,-Woman is a tender
and delicate organisation, with an intelli-
gent heart in it. I speak abstractedly,
and of womanhood in general, not as you
find it individualised without exception
in every woman—washerwoman, for in-
stance, or charwoman.
The intelligent heart of woman, Sir,
is for many purposes worth all the brains
in the world. "Is it equal to the per-
formance of political functions? Would
it suffice for the exercise of the elective
franchise, and ought it to entitle women
to votes ? Every man, almost, will ad-
mit that Miss RTINEAU is naturally
at least as well qualified to choose a
representative as MR. BROADHEAD, or
probably be represented by some one
not inferior, morally or intellectually to
- the man of their choice. But then it may
be said that Miss MARTINEAU is no ordinary “person.” Very true;
could not women, however, for political emancipation, be levelled up
sufficiently near to such a person's standard P “Educate the
masses” has long been the cry—attended with very little wool.
Suppose we now begin to shout “ £a. the Lasses.”
Legislators have decided that the numerical majority, educated even
as they are, is the wiser portion of mankind. They appear not to have
the same confidence in the majority of womankind. MR. MILL, pro-
bably takes the philosophical view in considering the majority of
women equally fit to vote with the majority of men. But it must be
owned that the mistrust existing on the other side is not wholly un-
founded. An objection of some weight to absolutely universal man-
hood suffrage is that the multitude of men is gregarious, and apt, now
and then, to follow a leader who may be a wolf in sheep's clothing, or,
even a goose. Now women are much more gregarious than men.
With very few exceptions they all go in droves: as you see in the
matter of fashion. Whilst the crinoline mania lasted, what was the
good of pointing out the absurdity of crinoline : How many women
did it induce to leave their hoops off f Rather than that they died at
the firegrate, martyrs to fashion. Ask any woman now to drop her
monstrous chignon. You might as well request a black cat to turn
white. This very general unreason may, not unreasonably, be regarded
as a disqualification for the suffrage. Is it not fair to say to the fair
sex—“Emancipate yourselves from the tyranny of fashion, and then
you shall enjoy the rights of free women.”
I may be an optimist, Mr. Punch, but I look to a bright future for
female humanity. I confidently expect to see the time, if I live long
enough, when, should the leader of the demi-monde, or whosoever else
may be the dictatrix cf the fashions at Paris, take up the * of
wearing a ring in her nose, her example will not be followed by the
women of England. And then 1 trust that my enfranchised country-
women will, grateful for kind and good advice, rush to the poll, if they
are asked to, and vote for A LADY's MAN.
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
The White Fawn at the Holborn is, as its original, La Biche au Bois,
was at the Porte St. Martin, as successful an Extravaganza as any
F. of the kind since the glories of the WestBus productions at the
yceum. It is capitally played throughout; the music is sparkling,
and has the advantage of better voices than can usually be found in an
ordinary acting company, while the six legs belonging to the three Low
Comedians execute terpsichorean wonders in a grand Dance-Contest,
which takes the place of a fight, in such a grotesque fashion as leaves
scarcely any other dancers in London a leg to stand upon. The combina-
tions of colour evince great taste in costume, while the Ballets (for
there are two, and one of them, most ingeniously lit up with electric
sparks) shows the Management's great regard i. its patrons in the
stalls by its admirable “Natural Selection.”
The mention of The White Fawn reminds us of the new piece, The
Black Sheep, at the Olympic, which we have not yet seen, because it
is not (or was not at the time of writing) yet in sight. We may hope,
hºwever, that to the question, “Ba, Ba, Black Sheep, have you any
Wool?” MR. B. WEESTER may be able to reply, “Yes, Sir, I have,
Sir, House Crammed Full.” ith which good wish we leave Theatri-
cals for the present week.

would be taken in the right spirit. [With the right spirit, he perhaps meant, for
things went on in a most whiskeyfied manner.]
“MR. JAMEs ANDEason, Glasgow (speaking from the gallery). The like of Robert-
son coming forward after all this nonsense about our shares—it is making a perfect
fool of every one of us. (Laughter.)
“MR. Robertson. Who are you, Sir? who are you? (brandishing his fist.). I
know you of old, Sir; I know you of old. I leave it to any shareholder; I leave it to
Colonel Salked himself, if that is not a fair and legitimate proposal of retrench-
ment and economy.
“MR. ANDEason. It's a perfect farce; that's all I have got to say. (Laughter.)
“MR. Robertson (again shaking his fist). Are you not done yet, Edinburgh F. Do you
think we are going to lose our money, and stand hearing you Edinburgh oyster
boys with your £750 preference stock :
“The Chairman. F. as the board is to a considerable extent newly con-
stituted, MR. Robertsos might have spared himself the trouble of bringing forward
* MR. Robertsos. I differ from you, Sir.” º -
Why Edinburgh oyster boys, MR. Robertson f Was that meant
for a term of reproach # If so, allow a Saxon to say that it falls harm-
less. Mr. Punch has had such oysters in Edinburgh, (likewise at
Portobello, which was taken by ADMIRALWERNoN with six ships º:
—with concomitants—made him more than happy." Are you not done
et, Edinburgh?” is, however, a splendid outbreak, worthy to be
anded down with Quousque tandew, Catilina, “of Ciceronian plead-
ing ” (Burns). -

THE PLEASUREs of SHOPPING,
DEAR PUNCH, -
I AM one of the old school, and like the old ways, Judge
then, my old friend, of the shock to my equanimity the other day.
I required six pennyworth of goat buttons, and went into the first *
which looked like one for the sale of that article. On entering,
walked up to the counter
“Oh, Sir!” said h
Department,’ this is B Infºil. -
went to the other side, and “I want some buttons,” said I.
“What do you want them for f*
“For my coat.” - - - -
“Oh then, Sir, if yºu please, to the next shop, this is the “Ladies'
Button Department.’”
I was accordingly ushered by a perfumed ladies' button department
gentleman, through several gilded corridors, then up one pair of stairs,
and down another, and finally found myself roaming at large in the
gentlemen's department general. I went up to the first counter, and
repeated my request. - - -
‘Oh, Sir, if you please,” said the attendant, “the other side; this is
the 'Gentlemen's Flannel Department.’” -
It is needless to describe the thing any further. Suffice it to say
that, after applying at the Gentlemen's Hosiery Department, running
a tilt at the Gentlemen's Pantaloon Department, and being nearl
stranded on the Gentlemen's Fancy Shirt Department, I got what
wanted, sixpennyworth of buttons.
Ever yours, dear Punch,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 197
MR, PUNCH PAYS HIS
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 20. Easter holidays being over, DR. DISRAELI's
§: friends re-assembled, to count the weeks until Whitsuntide
olidays.
". vacancies occur. Peers have been made, and the voices of
| Sirs John WALSH. BRook BRIDGEs, and JoHN TRollope will be heard
no more in the Nether House, Lords QRMATHWAITE, FITzwalter,
and KESTEven walking into the Chamber of Peers.” Sir Morros
| PETo, bankrupt, has resigned Bristol, for which MILEs and MoRLEY
| fight on the day Mr. Punch appears, and there be other changes.
The work began with a severe attack by MR. S.Mollett on the
| Madras Irrigation Company and the conduct of the Government, which
has been guaranteeing interest for ever, without taking care that the
waterworks shall last for ever, or even for any time at all, inasmuch as,
according to MR. S.MolleTT, the channels are so constructed as to be
of no use. Next, the Company having collapsed, Government takes
the 'affair into its own hands. R. S.MoLLETT was very severe on
everybody, and used language which does not seem out of place in
Roderick Random, but which its author's descendant might have made
a little more decorous for the House of Commons. The Indian Minis-
ter answered, of course, and, equally of course, there was an empty
house. Who cares about watering the provinces of India?
MR. WAT KIN moved for an inquiry into the affairs of Ceylon, but he
was set upon by MR. ADDERLEY, whose hymn was that
“Although the spicy breezes
Blow soft o'er Ceylon's Isle,
And every prospect pleases,
E. WATKIN has the bile.”
Then we got on Estimates, and the debates were dull, until a select
party began an attack upon Hampton Court Palace, and tried to reduce
the vote, for keeping up that place. Punch is happy to say that LoRD
John MANNERs, utterly routed them. , Hampton Court Palace is a
place of which the poor are º fond. They can get there
without, much expense, there is no trouble in going in-(the artisan's
wife seldom being afflicted with a lace parasol which has to be taken
away from her—fine ladies and cooks suffer heavily in this way), there
is no trouble in seeing all the sights, the gardens are very pretty, and

the gold fish very tame and fat, and there ſs no attempt to bother the

Tuesday. MR, SHAw LEFEvRE brought in a Bill for f; a wife
absolute control over her own property, or earnings, or deposits. He
mentioned that there are 3,200, married women in this country
working for their living—800,000 of them in trades. The Law Amend-
ment Society thinks that the law should be altered, that the wife should
retain her property after marriage, instead of its becoming the husband's,
and that anything which she afterwards may obtain should be at her own
disposal, The Sanctity of Marriage would, of course, be appealed to,
but as that, was habitually violated by settlement under Chancery
order, the objection was answered by anticipation. MR. MILL seconded
the motion. Mr. Punch, who never hesitates to express his opinion on
anything, from a new pin to a new planet, says that there is much
Philosophy in the view of MEssRs. LeFevre and MILL. But he does
not suppose that it will find much acceptance, because there is a sort
of notion, partly derived from the usage of several thousand years,
partly from human nature, partly from theological teaching, that
somehow marriage is a little more than a mere partnership between
EDw1N Jones and ANGELINA BRowN, and that in return for EDw1N's
name, strong arm, protection, support, maintenance, fidelity, and
labour, ANGELINA is to become a complementary Edwin, rather than
to remain an independent ANGELINA. Also, the marriage service says
something about a mystical union, the conditions whereof may not
seem exactly satisfied by rival, banking accounts. There are a great
many hard cases,'divers of which are the fault of Fº who are in such
a hurry to be married that they don't take half the pains to inquire
into the character of a spouse which they would give to that of a
servant. But there are settlements for the rich, and protection orders
for the poor; and so long as a married couple, neither rich nor poor
lives together, it may be for the promotion of affection that there should
be no separate interests.
- After the Matrimonial Noose Question had been laid aside, we came
to the Capital Punishment Bill—the measure for making executions
private. Hereupon MR. GILPIN rode a race upon his favourite hobby,
and delivered a long speech to show that there ought to be no execu-
tions at all. He finished, with so pathetic a. picture of the dying
criminal, penitent and ready for glory, but considered unfit for earth,

that MR. GREGoRY sprang up and declared that the question was nºt
one of softening hearts or saving souls, but of preventing the QUEEN's
* from being murdered. But the speech of the night was
that o
MR. MILL, who approved of many of the labours of the “philan-
thropists,” but said that they ought to know when to stop. To deprive
a criminal of the life of which he had proved himself unworthy-
solemnly to blot him out from the fellowship of mankind; and from the
catalogue of the living—was the most appropriate and the most im-
pressive mode in which society could deal with so great a crime as
murder. Imprisonment Jºe far more cruel, and less efficacious.
None could say that this punishment had failed, for mone could say
who had been deterred, and how many would not have been murderers
but for the awful idea of the gallows P. Do not bring about, an ener-
vation, an effeminacy in the mind of the nation; for it, is that to be
more shocked by taking a man’s life than by taking all that makes life
valuable. Is death the greatest of all earthly ills? A manly educa-
tion teaches us the contrary; if an evil at all, it is one not high in the
list of evils. Respect the capacity of suffering, not of merely existing.
It is not human life only, not human life as such, but human feelings,
that should be held sacred. Moreover, taking life for murder no more
implies want of respect for life than fining a criminal shows want of
respect for property. In countries where execution is morbidly dis-
liked, there is no abhorrence of the assassin. MR. MILL added that
we had been in danger of reducing all our punishments to nothing;
and, though that disposition] had stopped, our penalties, for brutal
crimes (for which he earnestly recommended the Scourge) were ridi-
culously light, and ought to be strengthened. - - -
A speech like that “stints the strife;” the House went to Division
and by 127 to 23—Majority, 104–affirmed the principle of Capital
Punishments. Discussion on the clauses followed, the only remarkable
proposal being MB, NEATE's, who, because, hanging was disagreeable,
would administer Carbonic Acid Gas, or allow the criminal to destroy
himself. The latter suggestion made the Committee laugh; and cer-
tainly, the idea of CALCRAFT coming into the cell, and, like the gaoler
of Socrates, respectfully presenting GoRDON, of Jamaica, or, PRIT:
chard, of Glasgow, with a bowl of poison, was provocative. The Bill
passed through its last stage but one.
Wednesday. Theology, of course. Battle on a Bill for allowing
Roman Catholics to be buried, with their own religious service, in
Irish Churchyards, without obtaining leave from the Protestant incum-
bent, who, it was asserted, always refused this. The measure was
resisted by the LEF.Roy and NewDEGATE party for the usual anti-
Catholic feeling; but MR. HENLEY, who has his prejudices, but is not
a bigot, suggested that the real objection to free burial might be, that
three sets of religionists might come at once, and the churchyard be a
| scene of unseemly strife. But
“Gin a body meet a body,
Need the mourners fight?”
This is only a detail, and the London cemeteries never witness frays.
The Second Reading was carried by 74 to 51.
Thursday. The EARL OF DERBY, walking with a vigorous step
took his place in the House of Lords. "He will accept Mr. #
congratulations.
MR. D'ARcy M'GEE, an Irish gentleman whose antecedents were
rebellious, but who became a loyal and valuable servant of the Crow
has been brutally murdered, at Ottawa, by a Fenian, who assassinate
him on his way from doing his duty in the House of Commons. The
Canadians are justly enraged to the utmost, and caught the murderer,
and, as they believe, accomplices, for all of whom there will probably
be “a short shrift and a long cord.” The Colonial SECRETARY to-
night spoke worthily of the slaughtered victim, who is assuredly a
martyr to loyalty.
MR. GLADston E's Bill for the mild extinction of the Church Rate
was considered by the Lords. It was introduced by EARL Russell.
Mr. Punch is sorry to say that some of the Peers showed small wisdom.
The Bishops of London and Oxford spoke as men of the world, who
saw that the time had come for a concession, and so they made it; but
LoRD DER BY assailed the measure with much fire, and LoRD CAIRNs
also assaulted it. These friends of the Church had better pass the
Bill—or the next will be a shorter and less civil one. It was read a
Second Time, but menaced with a Select Committee.
In the Commons the new CHANCELLOR or THE EXCHEQUER brought
in the Budget which it had pleased MR. DisrAELI and the Depart-
ments to give him. We shall say nothing about it, except that there
is a deficiency of upwards of a Million and a Half, and of course the
money is taken from the Middle Class, which never defends itself.
The Income-Tar is to be raised to Sirpence.
There was something about India, at least Northcote made a very
long speech, but we were much too sulky to listen. Improved Govern-
ment, or something of the sort. Income-Tax, Sixpence. We’ll save
or evade it somehow, MRs. GRUNDY, eh?
... Friday. The Lords, sent the Church Rate Bill to a Committee, and
it may be that it will be improved there. But the principle must be
again
unch's
accepted fine grano. The author, MR. GLApstone, publishes a letter,
denying that he is a Papist, a confederate with the Pope, an enemy of
DR. WYNTER, a condemner of public aid to the Clergy, a refuser to
attend the QUEEN to a Scotch Kirk, a receiver of Papal thanks, or a
member of a Ritualist Church. He knows best what attention liars
and fools deserve; but, while he was about it, we think he might have
added, for the amusement of those who are neither, that, he is not a
Buddhist, does not speak, with his mouth full, never broke into a
Sausage shop, takes off his hat in church, is not afraid of snails, seldom
cheats at whist, dislikes eating asparagus stalks, and has not been
turned out of the gallery of the Adelphi Theatre for insisting on “Hot
Codlings” in the middle of No Thoroughfare.
In the Commons, a debate on Crete, and exchange of abuse of Turks
and Russia, and another on the case of a Post Office Clerk, extruded,
after having been reprimanded 9 times in 1866, and ll times between
February and July, 1867. Truly the Legislature has leisure.
THE BUDGET OF THE FUTURE,
Lo, the Income-Tax ascending
War expenses to defray,
You, whose cash alone by spending
Its whole cost the State will payi
And would you have others share it
In proportion just and due *
“Wictims, you must grin and bear it,”
Parliament replies to you.
Bear it; yes, for not much longer)
That injustice you'll endure.
When the masses are the stronger,
Equal burdens they’ll insure.
They’ll insist that each his fraction
Of taxation shall sustain,
And no more, of gross exaction,
One sole class stand all the strain.
Hope, from Parliaments elected
By the People, justice done,
And the rights of all respected,
Imposition forced on none.
Wrong will ne'er be done to any,
When their will its way has got.
Then, wars voted by the Many,
Will the Few be taxed for, not.
A CAPITAL PUBLIC DINNER.
As a rule, a public dinner is a thing to be avoided and abhorred, like
a bagpipe or a barrel-organ, or any other noisy nuisance. However,
there is now a marked exception to this rule, and such a pleasant
novelty demands a pleasant notice.
MR. John PARRY, having given up his Merrymaking, now makes
merry with the people who attend a public dinner. In half-an-hour of
drollery he personates a dozen of the bores whom public diners meet
wherever they may dine, and he makes them so amusing that all who meet
them with him wish to meet them all again. By mere facial expression
and a slight change of the voice, MR. PARRY fills his stage with a host
of public characters, without whom no public dinner could be deemed
to be complete. . He is by turns a chairman, a steward, a treasurer,
a toastmaster, a man who can't speak without laughing, another who
can’t speak without crying, a band of music, a soprano, a procession of
|small children, and a tenor with a cold, What most “entertainers"
fail to do by aid of wigs and whiskers, MR. PARRY does successfully by
change of tone and look. , When you see him as a lady sitting down
to a piano, pulling off her gloves, arranging a stray curl, and smoothing
down her dress, you believe yourself the victim of an optical, delusion,
| when you find it is a gentleman on whom your eyes are fixed. Clever
artists have the power by half-a-dozen touches to present a life-like
face; but John PARRY by an attitude can represent a person, and por-
tray a man, a child, a lady, or a lapdog, by a gesture or a glance. By
just one touch of nature he makes the whole world grin; and, if we be
pardoned for a further misquotation, we may say that, as an enter-
taining “entertainer,” none but himself can be his Parrylel.
What says Sir Bernard Burke P
In the Installation Procession in St. Patrick's, there was a “gentle-
man at large.” “Who could this be?” the curious ask. Some one
who was released from incarceration for that day only, on his promising
to return at nightfall P. But Irish gentlemen have been far too wise to
bring themselves into this predicament. It therefore remains a myste
who the “gentleman at large” was, and how he got his ticket-of-
leave—a thousand pardons, admission—to the Cathedral.

THE ABYSSINIAN DIFFICULTY.
(Concerning certain “Know-nothings.”)
DURING the present expedition to Abyssinia, I, as one of Mr. Punch's
Educational Committee, have been much interested in listening to the
various opinions freely expressed on all hands as to the merits and
demerits of our naval and military organisation.
One young gentleman held forth on the blunders committed by our
chiefs: an elderly person, connected prospectively with the Librarian's
department of the New Courts of Law, gravely deplored the prevalence
of red-tapeism at Head-quarters; another individual, who brought the
authority of a prematurely bald head to bear on the question, asserted
that all the Abyssinian travellers up to the present time had been
wrong in their explorations, and that, in fact, no one knew anything at
all about the country. The aunt of a cornet who had served in the
Crimea (of course the cornet, not the aunt), and who, therefore (the
aunt, not the cornet, this time), ought to know, expressed much con-
tempt for the mule arrangements; and a lady of uncertain age, who
had, it was, commonly whispered, been engaged, years ago. to an
Austrian Colonel (who was conquered at Baden-Baden, and 3bliged to
beat a retreat from that dissipated camp), wished that our troops were
managed after the Continental, fashion, when they would be always
§ for action, whereupon a tºº. gentleman, with military
whiskers joining his moustache, as if they all came off together if pulled
over the ear, stretched his legs before the fire, frowned on the circle,
and smacking his lips, as much as to say, Here’s something nice for
you in the way of a clincher,” observed, “They ought to have sent a
flying column into the country.”
There was a deep, silence. Everyone evidently was regretting the
omission, and, from the expression on their faces, individually takin
the blame upon himself or herself for such an evident neglect. Sud-
denly inspired, I asked, submissively,
“What is a flying column P’’
Everyone looked at me, then at the military man, who frowned
harder than ever. - -
“A flying column?” he returned, raising his eyebrows, as much as
to say, “What! don't you know that?” -
A smile of pity for my ignorance was on all lips.
Rendered desperate, I repeated the question, “Yes, a flying column;
what is a flying column?”
. All eyes waited upon the military whiskers, who, having got himself
into the hole, unassisted might now get himself out again. repu-
tation was at this moment as nicely poised as a rocking-stone.
“A flying column,” he commenced slowly, and, upon my word, I
felt for him—“a flying column is a column º should say”—
here he brightened #. “But, first, do you know what a column is f"
Now, here was a dilemma. If I said “Yes,” then he’d ask me for the
information. If I said “No,” then he’d say that it was no use explain-
ing a flying column to a man who didn't understand the meaning of
an ordinary Column that didn't fly. But the ladies came to the rescue;
under cover of my assumed ignorance, they ventured to inquire the
nature of a column and of a flying column. Whiskers was in for it,
and being in for it, it was at least a quarter of an hour before he got
out of it, and then, he only saved himself by flight under cover of an
º at the Horse Guards. -
hen he had gone I asked the young man, who had been finding so
much fault with our military and naval organisation, to describe the
system and plan of our Army to me. I asked him, How many foot regi-
ments are there? How many regiments of Guards f How many Line?
How many Cavalry f What are the regulations as to age of entrance?
His answer was that a Captain, in the Line ranked as a lieutenant
and something else in the Guards: that there was a Guards' Club in
Piccadilly: that a fellow he knew was often on guard at the Bank, and
that, everything in a general way was grossly mismanaged somehow,
but he hadn't time to go into details. To the prematurely bald person
who had set down all Abyssinian travellers as hitherto totally wrong
regarding that country, I put one simple question, “Where is Abys-
Wol. Liv.

sinia?” I wouldn't let him laugh it off or treat it as a joke, “Where
is Abyssinia P” l repeated sternly, xx -
It was no good for him to say, “Oh, you know,” jocosely. I was not
to be trifled with. Besides, I saw I was doing a good work, and
| awakening the others to a sense of the nonsense they’d been talking,
so I pushed into the enemy's country, crying no quarter, no parley,
|
“Where is Abyssinia?” -
If the carpet pattern could have opened and swallowed him up
(into the dining-room) he would have been thankful. -
“Well,” says he, rubbing his knees, “Abyssinia is—I can't exactly
give you the latitude and longitude”—the humbug-I wouldn't hear
of the latitude or longitude—where, I demanded was Abyssinia P
The wretched impostor, who had sneered at our explorers and
learned travellers, hesitated, and then looking me full in the face, said
boldly, “Africa.” I saw that even this was information for some of them.
“North or south?” I asked, scarcely giving him time to breathe.
“About the middle,” he replied, cautiously; “perhaps a little more
south than north, if anything.”
He was uncomfortable: but I knew he would go home and consult
his map; so I left him (he sneaked off when my back was turned), and
confronted the lady who had praised the Continental armies at our
expense.
ACROBATS IN PETTICOATS.
- I- Hough Mr. Punch is a Hercules
himself, he is fond of seeing the
performance of feats of strength by
others; and he has specially been
pleased by the Japanese performers,
who astonish weak minds nightly
at the Lyceum Theatre. Mr. Punch
dislikes all acrobats who aim to make
his flesh creep, or his hair to stand
on end, by the peril they are placed
in. These Japanese, however, only
make him stare and clap his hands
with admiration. All they do is done
with such apparent ease that there
never seems a chance of any accident
occurring. They fan themselves so
calmly in the middle of their feats,
that mothing they can do seems dif-
ficult or dangerous. No accountant
can be cleverer at balancing than
they : and in their feats of ledger-
de-main they would beat the best of
book-keepers. Climbing up a bam-
boo, and squatting cross-legged at
the top, appears as natural to them
as it would be to a monkey. To lie
flat on one's back, and balance boys
and tubs and ladders on one's feet,
seems as easy to these men as swim-
ming to a cod-fish.
Acrobats in petticoats have been
popular of late, and, Mr. Punch by
no means admires their popularity.
It is bad taste in a woman to §.
form on the trapeze, and tumble,
and throw summersaults; and it is
worse taste in the public to applaud
her exhibition. These Japanese,
however, are men who wear a petti-
coat as Scotchmen wear a kilt, and their novelty of costume adds a
charm to their performance.
Their children, too, look plump and pleasant, and not stunted and
deformed, like those who move our pity in our pantomimes and circuses.
One little chap climbs up a ladder, balanced by his father on the soles
of his feet, and then creeps along another at right angles to the first,
without a quiver in the balance. Another little fellow sits upon a tub
that is hoisted in the air upon half a score of others, all of which are
kicked away by the feet whereon they rest, which catch the lad as
deftly as players catch a cricket-ball.
so perfectly at ease that nobody feels nervous at seeing their perform-
ance. Indeed the only fear that Mr. Punch º: was the dread
lest Master Punch, who happened to be present, might be tempted to
º: some Japanese feats in his nursery, such as balancing the
aby on the spike of an umbrella, or spinning a big humming-top on
the edge of the best carving-knife, or breaking Mrs. Punch's most
§: fan while attempting to perform the feat of flying paper
utterflies.

“What,” I asked, “did she see to prefer in their systems?”
She murmured faintly, “Vivandières!” and looked so imploringly
at me that I hadn't the heart to push the question further.
The rest were scattered, and at my mercy completely.
Sir, I hear a great deal of nonsense talked about manythings, but about
none, at present, more than about our Abyssinian Difficulty. When,
therefore, in future, the subject is started, a few home questions will
soon show who among the party are competent to talk upon it; and
if, after a few geographical inquiries, you ask the object of our Expe-
dition, you may be pretty sure that the respondent is not well posted
up in the facts of the case if he replies, “Well, I suppose that Old

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
and be ready to do all he knew.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 27. An Irishman, and a Fenian, calling himself
O'Farrel (the name has served as well as any other in his execution-
warrant) came behind PRINCE ALFRED, Duke of Edinburgh, at a ban-
quet held at Port Jackson, on the 12th of March, in aid of a charitable
institution, and fired a pistol at the young Prince. The bullet lodged
in his back, but did no great harm, and has been extracted... The
Prince, was to be sent to his home, and the ruffian to his gallows.
Even the favourers of Fenianism have not ventured to say anything in
behalf of a miscreant who could try to murder a boy in order to wound
the heart of his mother, the Queen of Ireland. Addresses of sympathy
were voted by both Houses of Parliament.
LoRD DERBy gave notice to EARL Russell to put his hands up,
The Education Bill of the Government was rather severely handled
by two or three opposition Lords, but was read a Second Time. LoRD
GRANVILLE, who was suffering from, gout, a gentlemanly disorder-
HoRACE WALPoLE says no disorder, but a remedy—but uncommonly
disagreeable, had the pluck to stand up and make an Education speech.
Perhaps the debate, which partook of the character of morphia, had
assuaged his trouble; if not, he deserves the laudation due to a man of
brave endurance.
SIR Robert NAPIER has stormed Magdala, the captives are free,
and KING THEoDoRE is dead. Naturally, therefore, the House cheered
the lndian Minister when he came in to-day. The PREMIER, in answer
to M.R. LAYARD, confirmed the good news, and likened our progress to
that of CoRTEz in Mexico—with the difference that CoRTEz went to
plunder and massacre, NAPIER to execute justice.
“So, sink Pizarro's daring name,
And, CoRTEz, thine, in NAPIER’s fame.”
Who wrote those lines? For NAPIER read BERTRAM, and consult
Rokeby. They are not particularly good, but are quoted to show Mr.
Punch's readiness in the citation line. |
The SPEAKER left the chair, MR. DoDsoN took his, and invited MR.
GLADstone to move the First of his Three Resolutions, namely,–
That the Established Church of Ireland should cease to exist as an
establishment.
MR. GLADston E moved this in a meat nod, and there was
Debate all might on the lish Church.
Tuesday. LoRD DERBY squared up at EARL Russell, and let fl
right and left, chaffing very well, and charging the smaller Earl Wi.
inconsistency. He supposed LoRD RUssell might be still of the same
mind about the Irish Church as he was when he spoke at St. James's
Hall, on a platform with BEALEs, Potter, and MAsoN JONES, though
this was a fortnight ago, and therefore LoRD DERBY demanded what
the Opposition was going to do. The third of MR. GLADstone's reso-
lutions was a defiance of law, and would bring the Houses into col-
lision. He advised Government, whatever might be the Provocation,
not to resign until the enlarged constituency should have elected a
new Parliament.
LoRD Russell quoted BURRE. “I vary my means to secure the
consistency of my ends.” He had modified his views as to the best way
of securing religious equality in Ireland. LoRD, DERBy had no busi-
ness to ask him questions, but the promoters of the Resolutions meant
to found a Bill on them, and, when it had passed through Parliament,
to submit it to the QUEEN, and if the Ministers chose to give advice
that might bring on a collision, they would come to grief.
LoRD GRANville remarked upon the novelty introduced by LoRD
DeRBy... He was out of office, LoRD Russell was out of office, and
he ºtioned LoRD RUssell as to what men in office were going
to do.
LoRD CHANCELLORCAIRNs was down upon that third Resolution.
It asks the QUEEN to place her Irish patronage at the disposal of Par-
liament, and the cue has been given to the Conservatives to pretend to
believe that by Parliament MR. GLADSTONE meant the House of
Commons.
LoRD MALMESBURY was very angry because noble Lords went away
without listening to him. Mr. Punch, with regret, must follow their
example.
In the Commons there was
Debate all night on the Irish Church.
Wednesday. SIR WILLIAM HUTT has a Bill designed to promote
something like honesty on the part of Railway and Joint Stock Com-
panies. He wants to compel them to make out truthful accounts, in a
prescribed form, half-year { This cruel and persecuting measure was
sent to a Committee which has a ministerial Bill, of similar character,
before it. Where is this tyranny to cease? We shall have a Bill next
for compelling railway clerks to give the right change in good money,
and to answer civilly.
A Bill for making County Financial Boards was thrown out.
Whether they were to be made by sawing, or by what other means,
Punch did not care to comprehend. The Bill was probably a good
one, as the Ministry of the squirearchy opposed it.
SIR Colman O'Logh LEN had a Bill for preventing the Crown
from making any more Irish Peers, but as the SPEAKER seemed rather
to think that if SIR, CoLMAN went on, it would be the unpleasant duty
of the Serjeant-at-Arms to take him out into Palace Yard and cut off
his head, he withdrew the Bill.
MR. Torrens has a Bill for helping artisans to better dwelling-
houses, and at a late period the Government has found divers objec-
tions to it. There are objections to everything, and we should never
et anything done if we waited until perfection could be obtained.
R. LABouch ERE, mentioned that some discounting fellow is secretly
buying up miserable dwellings in the hope of getting large compen:
sation when this Bill shall be passed. If MR. LABouchERE will send
us the name, we will do our best to defeat the amiable purpose.
Thursday. The Church Rates, Abolition Bill was sent to a Select
Committee of Lords, on the understanding that the principle is agreed
to, and that the amendments are to be improvements only. LoRD
MALMEs BURY, having recovered his valuable temper, was “much
obliged” to LoRD Russell for letting the Bill go up-stairs.
Then, passing with smiles from the Church and LoRD RUssell,
My Lords they attended to Oyster and Mussel.
In the Commons,
MR. MILEs, who had just come in for Bristol, after a tremendous
struggle with MR. MoRLEY, another ultra-radical demigod of the
MoRTON PETo type, took his seat in time to be of no use in the
struggle that was coming next.
One scoundrel, Michael BARRETT, has been convicted for a share
in the Clerkenwell atrocity, and has been sentenced to be hanged on
the 12th. MR. Joseph REARDoN, an Irish Member, asked the HoME
SECRETARY whether he would not reprieve the wretch, seeing that he
had managed to get some witnesses to swear to an alibi. MR. HARDY
was sorry that a Member of Parliament could feel it a duty to ask
such a question. The cheers of the House marked its sense of this
exhibition of interest in a Fenian rufian. We suppose it is perfunc-
tory, for MR. Joseph REARDON appears from his speech about the Irish
Clergy to be a very kind-hearted gentleman, and we must . say
that any exertion for the doomed beast BARRETT is Not for Joseph.
On the eve of the Private View day, MR. LAYARD º -
asked whether the Royal Academy's new buildings at the back of
Burlington House were so nearly ready that the next Exhibition
|might be held there, but for the Royal Society's Library stopping the
way. LoRD JoHN MANNERs said that the work was going on as fast as
possible, but that moving 100,000 books twice was a serious business.
These swells, accustomed to the imbecility of their lazy menials, think
everything serious. We would back a couple of the spirited officials
at the Museum to bring a staff that should move, dust, and catalogue
every book in a fortnight.
Then came a row because MR. SURTEEs, a valiant Protestant, wanted
an old Catholic oath read. MR GLADstone opposed the reading as
intended to annoy, and so did MR. DisBAELI.
Debate all night on the Irish Church.
Ha! But not of the flat and meagre kind which had marked the
receding nights. The debate was closed by a brilliant speech from
º GLADstone, the best he has made on the subject. He not only an-
swered, very effectively, all his antagonists in that House, but, adverting
to what Lord DERby had said on the Tuesday night, declared that as
a representative of the people he would not receive the word of com-
mand from the House of Lords.
The PREMIER replied, as he said, in a condensed way, and spoke
rather as one who must speak than because he had either convinced
himself or thought of convincing others. Indeed, he made some fun
at the expense of the Irish Church, for he said that it ought no more
to be disendowed because it did not fulfil the intention of its founder,
than certain Companies should be for the same reason. The Fish-
mongers no longer supplied good fish, and he had dined at the Merchant
Taylors, but never, he believed, had met his own tailor. When agen-
tleman drops into pleasant banter over the Crisis of England, and the
Destruction of our Holy Religion, we may be assured that he sees no
more use in the nonsense he talked for the sake of the Stupid. And
then, though the Conservatives have won some elections, the numbers,
when division was taken, were-
For MR. GLADSTONE .
For Government - -
330
265
Provocation to resign Sixty-Five.
Last time, remember the majorities were 56, and 60. - -
MR. Dish AELI. “The relations between the House and the Ministers
are altered. It is necessary for us to consider our position. I propose
to adjourn until Monday.”
“What man,
What Roman, would be dragged in triumph thus,
Not Punch : not he who bears one name with them
Whose freedom cost the Egyptian host and king.”
Luck Erius—(varied).

EXCOMMUNICATING AND EXCOMMUNICATED.
THE celebrated Bishop of Capetown, DR, GRAY, is reported to have preached a Sermon last
week on Tuesday evening, at Holy Trinity Church, Colchester, when-
“After remarking on the troubles and trials of the Church in these latter days, and giving a sketch of the
great work that was being carried on in Africa, his Lordship took occasion to allude to Bishop Colºnso, and
after recounting the heresies alleged against him, said that Churchmen in Africa had done what they could to
clear themselves of responsibility in the sight of God and man; they had declared that this false teacher was no
longer in their communion, that they did not recognise him as such. But it yet remained for the Mother Church
to do the same; for until this had been done they would not be clear in the sight of Christendom.”
The attention of Bishop GRAY is respectfully called to the following extract from an article in
the Observatore Romano, on “The Maledic-
tion of Protestant barrenness”:-
“The false Anglican Church, separated from the
true Church of Rome, could not be better described
than the Anglican Lowe did with the above words.
Yet the English Protestants cultivated with great
care, labour, and love the Anglican Church in Ire-
land, so that its sterility is innate in schism and
error, and will only cease when heresy itself ceases

that, the Osservatore Romano is an organ
which expresses the sentiments of one of
the Bishops of that Christendom in whose
sight he wishes the Mother Church of Eng-
land to put herself clear by excommunica.
ting Bishop Colenso. It may further be
necessary to tell DR. GRAY that the Bishop
represented by the Osservatore Romano is
no other than one who claims to be the chief
of Christendom's Bishops, and is acknow-
ledged as such by the greater part of
Qhristendom; in short, his Holiness the
Pope. Now let DR. GRAY be pleased to
observe that the Pope's own paper calls the
Anglican Church a false Church, and its doc-
trine heresy; consequently, DR. GRAY, him-
self a heretic and a false Bishop. This being
the opinion respecting the Anglican Church
and all its Bishops, the Bishop of CAPE-
Town inclusive, in which Christendom for
the most º entirely agrees, it may be as
well for 5. Gº to consider whether, by
affecting to excommunicate DR. Colenso,
his Mother Church will put herself in any

THE LAUREATE'S NEW POEM.
MR. ALFREDTENNyson has just published, in Macmillan's Magazine,
a poem called Lucretius. It will be read by everybody, because it is
written by the Laureate, and it should be read, by everybody, firstly,
for that good reason, and secondly, because it is a poem of singular
beauty and power. Now, as Mr. Punch is ever, anxious to assist the
Diner-Out, that person is recommended to arm himself for inevitable
cross-examination by young ladies, who desire, or pretend to desire
information upon the subject of and the allusions in this poem, now
the talk of society. Diner:Out will do well to get the poem, and with
the aid of DR. WILLIAM SMITH's classical dictionary, and some con-
sideration, enable himself to answer the following questions.
l. Who was LUCRETIUs, and in what year B.C. did that Roman
poet live P
2. What is the Hexameter f

CHAPTER XX.
TIME RUNS ON.
GRACE MARCHMONT had sunk in terror upon the ground, while an
enormous turtle, more than six feet high, and broad in proportion, was
standing upon its hinder fins of iron muscle, and was regarding her with
a fixed amatory look, which NUTT at once interpreted as in the last degree
threatening and dangerous. Poor GRACE seemed utterly unable to
move, fascinated by the bright twinkling eye of the leering savage
monster which had assumed this hostile attitude a few feet from where
she was gathering sea-weed. In vain NUTT above tried to distract the
attention of the amphibious reptile; then he descended quickly, and
taking off one of his new boots, hurled it at the creature's head. With
a yell of disappointed love it turned from Miss MARCHMONT to regard
its new antagonist, who was standing on the defensive, hoping to draw
any attack upon himself, when the turtle seemed to stagger in his
purpose, and instead of attacking NUTT, commenced a slow unwieldy
movement, somewhat ...; a portion of the old minuet, swinging
its head, lazily from left to right, and accompanied by a low gurgling
sound, like the half suppressed laughter of an idiot, terrible to hear
. its eyes rolled with vague inconstancy, dwelling upon no fixe
object.
NUTT saw at once what was the matter.
“I have read of such cases,” he explained to MISS MARCHMONT,
who, pale and trembling, was now by his side.
“The Turtle is either mad, or simply an idiot. The head you can
see from here is very soft. With one blow from a switch,” here he
cut one from a neighbouring tree by the aid of a blade of grass, which
he had fitted to an agate handle, “I can despatch the fellow. He will
be very good eating.”
But at the sight of the switch the Turtle suddenly reeled and fell,
dead. . It was so sudden and strange, that NUTT could scarcely credit
the evidence of his senses.
“The Turtle saw the stick and expired from fright,” said GRACE;
“so much is evident.”
“Nature, Miss MARCHMONT,” answered NUTT, “never acts without
a reason, however distant the motive power may be from our present
vision, however obscure the cause of the visible result may be. In
this case I think I have traced the effect to its proper cause. This
huge Turtle has been doubtless the parent of a vast family, all destined

A NEw novel is advertised under the name of The Countess's Cross.
It is rumoured that this is the first of a series with similar titles, such
as, The Baroness's Bracelet, or The Fatal Clasp; The Duchess's Dia-

these works of fiction as precious rubbiah.

not the words City of London, Alderman, Lord Mayor, be a lesson to
the surviving mother. Undoubtedly, then she swooned and died on
seeing that the switch with which I had armed myself was—” he
hesitated.
“What?...I long to know, what?” exclaimed GRACE, anxiously.
“BIRCH,” replied NUTT. ..
This led to further conversation, and then GRACE asked him if he
thought anybody had ever been there before them. He was silent for
a considerable time, but on her assuring him that it was not meant as
a conundrum, he answered,—
“You asked me if I had any reason to believe that
been here before. I have: here it is.” And
he showed her certain indications of a building
of some sort having once stood on this very :
spot. i
What was remarkable and most puzzling ; ;

p GRACE was silent. Then she said slowly, “I know what it was.
Trace its form. These which you think were wings, were wheels.”
“A carriage!” exclaimed NUTT,inutter astonishment at the deduction.
“No,” answered GRACE, gravely; “has nothing wheels except a
carriage **
He looked at her. His mind was busy suggesting watches, manu-
factories, organs, steamers, and as busily rejecting them. Then he
said that he would give it up.
She answered slowly and sadly, “A Bathing Machine.”
They were silent awhile, both occupied with the many serious thoughts
suggested by this discovery.
Presently the bass voice gave utterance. “This was,” it said
solemnly, “perhaps the Margate of the ancient world, the Scarborough

many contingencies which might prevent an

of the trouble it would have caused her.
The turtle's eggs were delicious. The salad
made from the rare grasses of the island
excellent, and a, whale * to swim
within stone's throw of the island served
them (for he was soon i. by NUTT)
with oil enough, when gently strained through
a cullender of dried grass, interwoven with
twigs, for six weeks’ salad and a month's
lamps; but this latter was not required, as
they found gas on the island in large quan-
|tities, the pipes being naturally formed by
hollow bamboo canes from tree to tree and
rock to rock, which gave on a dark night the
|effect of a thousand additional lamps lit in
the well-wooded inclosure.
During the meal GRACE started up, and
exclaimed that the last bottle of St. Æmilion
had been lost in the wreck of the house,
“Let us look about us,” said NuTT, “per-
haps we may find a substitute.” After a few
minutes' search he came back, radiant with
smiles, and bearing in his hand a flowering
shrub of a most, peculiar description. Its
roots grew out above ground, deriving ap-
parently, its life from the various suckers
which shot themselves out into the air while
its leaves and branches had spread and flou-
|rished underneath the earth, affording shelter
to a variety of insects of a genus between
avis and scarabaeus.
| “This will serve us, MIss MARCHMONT,”
NUTT said, “for at all events one sort of
beverage for this evening. From it I shall
distil a sweet, and potent spirit, dear to

SNOBS AT THE OPERA.
HERE are some people
who apparently do not
care much for other
people; else, being at
the Opera, they would
not behave in this
way:-
“It is simply disgrace-
ful to see the unmannerly
conduct of holders of
boxes in the grand and
pittiers. During the solos
and duets it is no unfre-
quent thing to hear aloud
guffaw of laughter and
chattering, so loud in
tone as to entirely dis-
turb those of the audience
who go to hear the
music. One night last
week this was so marked
as to elicit loud hisses
from all parts of the
house, which, after all,
only partly checked the
nuisance."
One hardly would believe this in a civilised community; but the
Court Circular is certainly a trustworthy authority. Indeed, were
further evidence demanded, Mr. Punch might .# his own, for he
repeatedly has suffered from the nuisance fºre described. Certain
snobbesses and snobs think it fine to be heard talking in the middle of
an Opera, when the house is hushed and listening to 5. singers on the
stage. They like to make.believe they know the music so by heart
that it is hardly worth their while to pay the least attention to it.
They fancy that by making noises, when their neighbours all are
silent, they perhaps may º the credit of being old habitués; and so
: laug and chatter, being selfishly regardless of the nuisance they
create.
There is small use in appealing to the good taste of a snob; but it is
to be regretted that, when he has the bad taste to make himself offensive
at places like the Opera, the Nuisances Removal Act cannot beenforced.
Peºple, snobs and fools excepted, when they pay a visit and a guinea
at the Öpera, pay to hearthesinging of Patti, or of Mario, of Titless,
or TREBELLI, and not to hear the prattle of Miss Jones or MRSMITH.
If chatterers can't hold their tongues until the Act drop falls, they
ought to keep away, and not robother people of the pleasure they have
aid for. A snob, who makes a noise when MARio is singing should
e taken into custody and charged with picking pockets, for every
note he drowns is as good as a bank-note.
SET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER.
It is well known that, MR. BRIGHT, for instance, in the House of
Commons, is not called MR. BRIGHT, but the Honourable Member for
Birmingham, and that he will, when MR. GLApstone comes to be
Prime Minister, very likely be called the Right Honourable Gentleman
the Chancellor of the Exchequer. This is the rule of Parliament; and
its observance, in the Lower House, is perfectly easy. In the House
of Lords, however, as the Pall Mall Gazette has pointed out, “confu-
sion is, no doubt, sometimes occasioned by a reference to ‘the noble
Lord on the other side of the House, who followed the noble Earl on
the cross benches in replying to the remarks of my noble friend
behind me.’” This confusion might be prevented by adopting a
method of personal reference which would involve nothing more than
a slight sacrifice of dignity.
. A very great humorist once, speaking in a convivial assembly which
included some who were strangers to him, indicated one of them as
...thegentleman with the foreign waistcoat and domestic countenance.”
Their Lordships the Peers might, in mentioning one, another, adopt
similar methods of description. They might particularise the noble
Duke with the sandy hair, the noble Earl with the Roman nose, the
ºvered Prelate with the red-face, or the noble Lord who
squints.
If any of these descriptions were found to give offence to Peers
unable to take a joke, peculiarities of attire or ornament might be
adverted to instead of distinctions of form and feature. There could
be nothing unpleasant in calling a Peer the noble Marquisin the white
tie, or the noble Lord with the eye-glass. Mistakes would thus be
effectually precluded, and noble Lords would be enabled to observe a
maxim which all boys either born to or destined for seats in the High
Court of Parliament, should be taught to write in their copy-books.
“Avoid circumlocution.”

COSTUMES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY.
THE 3. of the Royal Academy Exhibition this year has, as a
matter of business, been interesting to artists of another class than the
brotherhood of the brush and the chisel. It must have proved very
beneficial to those whose art consists in the confection, as the technical
phrase is, of female costumes, namely, milliners and dressmakers; and
moreover, the linendrapers and silk-mercers must have derived a con-
siderable haul from it. The length of many of the trains worn by the
ladies who visit the picture-show of the Royal Academy might suggest
the supposition that their wearers regarded the Royalty of that Insti.
tution as being of a nature so absolute as to necessitate the display of
those flowing robes which etiquette demands at Court. .
There are trains and trains—excursion trains and ladies' trains.
By the former you go tripping; by the latter you get tripped up.
An excursion train taking the British Public to see a Volunteer
Review is long, but the trains worn by some of the fair visitors to the
above-named Exhibition, may be said to have been longer; for the
excursion train is *..." not more than long enough, whereas the
ladies' trains are all too long, at least for any purpose other than the
purposes of business, aforesaid. For no fellow, wedged in a crowd,
and contemplating the works of our best artists, can be expected
to look. and see where he is treading., Hence ensue damage and
destruction of skirts, to the loss of husbands and fathers, if to the
good of trade. Now, not only from a rational point of view, but with
regard to ostentation, the worst place in the world for long skirts is
a crowded room, where their presence is remarked in so far as it is
sensible to ºf only, and not to sight, being unperceived by the
eye, and felt by the soles. . In a picture gallery crammed with people

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH's ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
So the PREMIER went to see the QUEEN, and to mention to Her
Majesty the Provocation (as LoRD DERby calls it) which had been
given to the Ministry to resign. He came back, and on
Monday, May 4th, he expounded his doings and his intentions unto
the Provokers and his own men. The exposition occupies two columns
and a half, and though in no sense what Bottom calls an exposition of
sleep, it shall, as Hamlet says, to the barber's.
We, the Derby Ministry, did not dissolve, though we might have so
treated a Palmerston Parliament. -
We have governed the country beautifully. -
We have made England influential everywhere, but not by Bustling
Intermeddling. - - -
We j on liberating the Abyssinian, Captives, we chose the
victorious General, whom we supplied with all means of war. Therefore
Suddenly there uprose the Irish Church Question.
We have four reasons against Destroying the Irish Church:
1. It is a retrograde policy.
2. It endangers property. -
3. It disunites Religion from Authority.
4. It menaces the Church of England.
We have three reasons for Dissolution:
1. This Parliament cannot legislate conclusively. -
2. The Irish Church question had never been hinted at when this
Parliament was elected. - -
3. The opinion of the Nation on this question is opposed to the
opinion of this Parliament.
I do not care for the taunts about wanting to retain office. I have
never shown an undue desire to do so. -
We rule by a Minority, do we ? Then that is an Imputation, not on
us, but on the House. But it is false. We govern by general con-
sent. JoHN RUssell governed by a minority, if you like.
I saw the QUEEN, who acted with all her accustomed frankness,
kindness, and wisdom.
I said that I should advise a dissolution.
But that there were times
when the Sovereign should not be embarrassed by personal claims, and
if the QUEEN thought we had better retire, out we would instantly go,
with every grateful jº. Her Majesty, for her warm support,
and for the aid which the QUEEN gives to any Minister by her now
vast acquaintance with foreign affairs. In fact -
I tendered my resignation. The QUEEN took a day to consider, and
then Refused to accept, my resignation, and Declared her readiness to
Dissolve as soon as public business would permit. -
I then advised that the appeal should be to the New Constituency
to elect under my Reform Act. - -
I stated that I was advised that this might be managed in the
autumn.
I shall oppose the two remaining Resolutions, but without debate.
We must pass the Scotch and Irish Reform Bills, and the Boundary
#. and a short Act, hastening the operation of the English Reform
Ill.
Such was the PREMIER's explanation. He was at once followed by
MR. GLADSTONE. Never did a Minister dissolve when he had had
60 and 65 against him. There is no reason for a dissolution, and no
hope of reversing the decision of the Commons. I do not altogether
object to your compliments to some of your colleagues, but the conduct
of the Spending Departments I do greatly condemn. You gave the
QUEEN bad advice—
| [For, brethren, in spite of the exceeding care with which MR. DISRAELI
| spoke, he left a muddle in the minds of some of his hearers, who º
he meant that he had advised an appeal to the present electors. T
was cleared up in his reply.]
And I am glad She did not take it.
The only question was of your own Ministerial existence.
| Autumn be hanged—you will make it the Winter, and meantime you
|
are to govern, and carry important measures |
However, your fate is your own business. I mean to carry m
Resolutions and a Bill for suspending Irish Church Appointments, º
I make no Covenant with you.
MR. Lowe. So we are to keep in office a Ministry that neither
trusts the House, nor is trusted by it.
MR. NEW DEGATE. Nice talk. You treat us as a Warming Pan, do
you ? [He was too polite to add, “We’ll warm you.”]
MR. CHILDERs. Autumn ends on the 21st December. Tell me the
time at which you mean to dissolve.
MR. BRIGHT. You got into office by unworthy arts, you have held
office (I mean you, the PREMIER) by adopting a policy opposed to all
you had professed, and why are we to depart from Parliamentary and
constitutional usage to keep in place Ministers who have hooted all
their own principles out of the House? I am not convinced by a certain
newspaper. which has a constant small liaison with you. Are you to
sit there like the gods in LoRD DERby's Homer, eating Ambrosial
Provender? If we keep you in, the question can't be settled till 1870,
and the Irish will distrust us. Are Governments a set of Cricketers
wh9 think that they must have Innings, because others have had
theirs? I advise the House to watch you, for you will stick to office
until turned out by an Offensive vote. [It may be remarked that the
future Chancellor of Exchequer, or Indian Minister, or Trade Secre.
tary, or whatever it is to be, was not tormented to-night with any return
of the affability with which he has lately been afflicted.]
The PREMIER. The QUEEN gave her assent to a dissolution without
any reference to old or new constituencies. There! I believe we can
dissolve in November, but I will let you know. Newspaper, bother!
MR. BRIGHT is always thinking of º: but they are not public
opinion, nor is the country governed by them [of course, with the
exception of Panch], and I wish at least he would not charge us with
being in communication with Ç." journals. MR. Lowe is full
of the amenity and suavity which make him such a favourite, but if you
We are not afraid to appeal to the Nation. want a vote of No Confidence, pass one, but let it be a straightforward
vote. , (Loud cheers.) There is no candour or justice in transferring
recent votes into those of Want of Confidence.
There the Ministerial Crisis question dropped for the time, and we
went into Ways and Means and voted

Tuesday. Jolly row in the House to-night, based on the way the
DUKE of RichMond had spoken of the interview with the QUEEN.
The Duke, in fact, not having the fear of the fiery Provokers before
his eyes, frankly let out that the appeal would be to the old or new con-
stituencies, as might please the Minister. MR. DisrAELI showed very
good fence, but at last said that the permission to dissolve at present
referred only to the Irish Church question. It were not profitable or
amusing to re uce the Westminster Assembly’s Catechism for the
| PREMIER, but he managed to provoke the Provokers º: bearing.
MR. MILL brought in two Bills, for making Municipal Corporations,
and, for making a Corporation of London. They are not to be pro-
ceeded with, but are to set folks a-thinking.
Wednesday. Do you know that Mines (except Coal-Mines) are not
taxed -that is, the Lord of the Mine is rated, but the property, some
six millions and a half, escapes. MR. WINDHAM's Bill for making this
rateable, was read a Second Time. Thus far into the bowels of the
land he hath marched on without impediment.
Thursday. The Lords approved and read a Second Time the Bill for
Private Executions. A coroner's inquest is to be held on the body of
the criminal, so that there may be no room for insensate stories of the
escape of rich felons.
In the Commons there was simply the most appalling Shine that has
marked the debates for years.
MR. GLADstone's Resolutions were put, and MR. DISRAELI did not
divide against them. So, brethren, the Palmerston Parliament HAs
| DECREED THE DOOM of THE CHURCH of St. PATRICK AND THE
TUDORs.
. Then did two Scotch Members (MR. Aytoun and MR. LAMont) go
in for mischief like men. They proposed that the grant to Maynooth
(Catholic) and the Regium Donum (Presbyterian) should be discon-
tinued, and that no secularised money should be given in any way to
the Papists of Ireland. Then began the fray, and it waxed furious.
Divisions were taken, and all the Ministers went out of the House
into “a little room,” sarcastically, referred to by M.R. Gladstone,
though it was not the room's fault that it was little. Two forms of the
Scotch Resolution were rejected, but at last it was agreed to ; and so,
brethren, the Palmerston Parliament HAs Decreed THE Doom or
THE MAYNooth GRANT AND THE Roy AL GIFT. -
But of what bitter things were said by everybody who could think
of any, Mr. Punch can give but a slight notion. Acrihus ercicit sti-
mulis furialis ERINnys. MR. DisrAELI scoffed at the Provokers, who
were Quarrelling over the Plunder: MR. BRIGHT accused the PRE-
MIER of Pompousness and Servility: and, according to the Star, “in a
magnificent burst of eloquence, denounced him as a Traitor to his
Sovereign and his country;” Lord JoHN MANNERs derided MR.
BRIGHT for constantly praising his own virtue; MR. GLADstone
charged MR. DisrAELI with language such as had never been heard
from a Prime Minister; and MR. DisBAELI declared that his lan-
uage was appropriate; and, in spite of MR. BRIGHT's Stale Invective,
jº him to make a specific charge, and was willing to be judged by
the “Gentlemen” (marked emphasis on the word) who sat on the
Opposition side. -
Then the Irish Reform Bill was quietly read a Second Time.

“FEMALE PARISH OFFICERs.-On Saturday the Aylesbury Bench of Magistrates,
at their Annual Session for the appointment of Parish Officers for the several
parishes in their division, appointed MRs. SARAH WoostER to the offices of overseer
of the poor and surveyor of highways for the parish of Illmire, there being no other
‘person' resident there so j. qualified to perform the duties. Last year the same
magistrates appointed not fewer than four females to similar posts, in parishes
within the Aylesbury petty sessional division.”
It is no disparagement to the honourable Member for Westminster,
at any rate, to say that he is a respecter of persons. The same remar
with as little offence, may be made of Magistrates who evince the kin
of respect for persons that has been shown by the #. Bench in
electing persons of the feminine gender to the office of surveyor of
highways, and overseer of the poor. Experience very likely will justify
their worships, in extending woman's parochial sphere of usefulness.
The person who is fit to be overseer is fit to be churchwarden, and
also, if physically strong enough, for the place, and not unfitted by
station in life, fit also to be beadle. The paupers and the parish-boys
would rejoice under the rule of a beadle of the softer sex, and perhaps
if persons thereof were eligible for the post of relieving officer, an

“Can't intelligence be diffused?”
He stared at her. She repeated her

communing with herself, drank it.
Then he began to talk. -
“Th’. Lectry Trelgrar wufful’vention,” he began in a voice so little
resembling his own, that it was now her turn to stare at him in mute
Surprise.
He continued. “If we’d lectry Trelgrar here we send say where
were, bus sno Leckstrelgrar, thingspossil.” -
“Thing is what?’ she inquired, with a look of angelic reproach.
He slowly closed his right eye, which was turned towards her, an
shook his head as he repeated, “I shay things spossil.”
The thing is impossible,” do you mean that, MR. NUTT P” She
asked.
He laughed, and then became suddenly grave. He attempted, to
rise from his chair, which seemed to slip away from under him, and in
another moment he was prostrate beneath the table. - -
He told her afterwards that he then experienced a sweet delirium,
which seemed to him like the poetry of motion going the wrong way.
She knelt by his side, being nigh heartbroken. What, after all their
toils and danger was it to come to this?
What was she to do P
Had he been in her place, she thought, what would he have done?
Certainly not have sat there idle, uselessly bemoaning the past, regard-
less alike of present and future.
He slept for three hours, and she sat by him, keeping watch. 'Twas
all she could do.
At last he woke confused, giddy, with a splitting headache and a dry
distasteful tongue.
“Why am I not walking about ** he inquired. -
d With her ready woman’s wit, she replied, “Because you are lying
own.'
“I will take that for an answer,” he said, sadly.
“You are under my orders, now,” she said, playfully, “ and as your
doctor, I forbid you to rise.”
He wished to hear what prescription this young physician would
recommend, and finding that she had none to suggest, he asked her
with some curiosity what was that leaf with which she was playing at
that moment. She did not know, but was able to tell him that she
had gathered it from a tall tree on the Island.
“We are indeed fortunate, Miss MARCHMONT,” said NUTT. “This
tree is one of the rare productions of the tropics, and is Nature's own
rovision for the parched and weary traveller. It was doubtless over-
anging a clear running stream of no great depth.” .
“It was,” she answered, unable to restrain her evident admiration
of his apparently unlimited resources.
“I thought so,” he returned. “It is the Soda-water tree; squeeze
one of those lemons, which you will find growing, in large quantities
close at hand, into a tumbler, with a spoonful of this powdered sugar,
which I have luckily preserved in my pocket-book, º it will, I know
from experience, produced the desired effect.
She complied with his request, but she saw, though he whistled and
hooray'd whenever she approached, that the pain in his head was not
yet overcome.
He drank the soda-water and took the lemons, and though still
feverish he was enabled by these stimulants to give his mind to the
great problem which he had been engaged upon when he fell ill.
In the afternoon she left him for awhile, and returned joyfully with
two large dressed crabs which she had found apparently just about to
undress themselves (as is their wont, NUTT explained, to her in these
hot climates, and therefore she was to esteem herself fortunate in
arriving so opportunely) in cool cave upon the sea-shore.
The sun shone upon them brightly and burningly hot...With a
portion of NUTT's ingenuity she had plucked up one of the large
tropical mushrooms to serve her as a sunshade, ºil. the next size to
it she planted carefully over her patient's aching head.
“Do you think,” he asked, presently, “that your friends will ever
come in search of you?”
i: Then he made another
inking, and while she sat there
within herself than addressing an observation to her companion,
“They may,” she replied. “But if they do not, it would be pleasant
to get somebody to call here, even if only to have a little music in the
evening.”
She felt, immediately the words were out of her mouth, that the
speech was an unkind one. She placed her hand in his, and said
simply, “I did not mean that—I am very happy here.”
hen he saw his duty plainly, and set himself to do it.
His duty was to let anyone and everyone know that he was with a
young lady alone on an island.
He was puzzled, and looked at her inquiringly.
“No cards,” she murmured sadly, and she thought to herself “are
not these words in the marriage service f"
. “Friends at a distance will please accept this notice,” he said, as if
in reply to her thinking aloud.
A sharp . note from a bird struck on their ears.
NUTT turned, and looking upwards saw a bright red breasted puffy
little bird, not unlike a bull-finch perched on a branch.
He rose excitedly. “The problem is solved,” he cried. “This is the
bird for us. The salt! MIss MARCHMONT, for pity’s sake, the salt!”
|..She brought it to him, and they both approached the bird cautiously.
|His object was to climb the tree without disturbing the pretty little
warbler. It was a difficult matter, but he succeeded to admiration.
GRACE MARCHMONT stood transfixed to the spot in breathless sus-
pense. Another second, and the saline grains were sprinkled sharply
upon his tail, and he fell as she had seen the Pangofflins fall under the
same influence at sea. -
“The bird is stunned, not dead,” explained NUTT, “when he wakes
up he will be our messenger. He has served numbers of people before
this time, and, even in the most civilised countries, where the invention
of the Electric Telegraph has in a measure superseded that of writing,
the bird is still the vehicle of communication between various parties
who find this means most suitable for their purpose.”
| “And yet,” GRACE said, “it is not a pigeon.”

favouritism and timorous policy, and all may yet be well. .

Editor's Note to the Above.—The Editor did inspect the illustration alluded to
above, but unfortunately had mislaid his spectacles, without which all objects pre-
sent to his vision much the same appearance. The gentlemen engaged on this Novel
are far too generous and noble to be hard upon an Editor simply on account of an
affliction, on account of which he is rather an object of deep commiseration than of
scorn, temper and reproach. Let their kind hearts ponder over this, and not again
will be heard the petulant complaints of gentlemen who up to this time have shown
themselves in every way worthy of the high literary reputation with which they are
accredited. In the meantime, to Authors and Artists alike the Editor appeals, and,
| holding out the right hand of fellowship to all, he does hope that the good feeling
and forbearance and gentlemanly tone of all concerned will prevent any contretemps
occurring just when the work is progressing so admirably.
CHAPTER XXI.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
THE Boomerang (whom we indeed need no longer distinguish by this
| name) next proceeded to dry some leaves in the Sun, and having in the
| course of his rambles found a cedar tree and a vein of lead, he at
once constructed a couple of pencils, marked respectively H and B,
with which, however, he was not satisfied, and so waited patiently until
the evening, when he observed to GRACE, she would see what she
should then and there behold.
As she implored him to let her be of some use, he asked her to
gather for him a number of white ferns resembling feathers, while he
was engaged in fashioning a kind of awkward boot out of the turtle-fins.
When she returned laden she saw to her surprise that he had fitted
these fins on to his feet, and was practising a sort of step which he had
often seen the soldiers at home doing in the barrack-yard or on the
common at drill.
Without a question, for she had implicit trust in his wisdom, she
gave him the ferns, and assisted him to tie them, and otherwise fasten
them all about his body until he was completely covered. Then he
| stooped his body, and elevated his neck, and in this guise, and this
attitude, repeated the step she had already seen him practising.
“Oh you old goose!” she exclaimed, with an amused air,
.NUTT was delighted. “I have deceived you,” he said, “with this
disguise, and if I can deceive the birds who have no reason to guide
them to a conclusion, my object will be gained. The step I was

LITERARY FUND TOASTS
AND PUNCH'S SENTIMENTS.
HAT MR. DISRAELI was the
right man in the right place
in the Chair at the Literary
Fund Dinner, all will admit.
Whatever men's estimate of
the political DisBAELI, they
can É. contest the claims
of the author of Vivian
Grey, Contarini Fleming, and
Coningsby, to sit as the offi-
cial representative of let-
ters. Where shall we find
another author, who has
worked out in life, at sixty-
three, the very conception
| of a political leader, -as
45 the unscrupulous brains,
|'s tongue, and sword of a stu;
|'s pid, dumb, and dispirited
party,+which he had put
s forward in his first novel at
twenty? The worst that can
be said of him—that he habi:
tually confuses the limits of
romance and reality in his
speeches, and leaves us un-
certain whether what we
- - - - are listening to is fact or
fiction—involves a compliment to, his powers of invention and imagi:
- nation. But, while we feel that the Committee of the Literary Fund
had got hold of the right, Chairman for the last dinner, we find it
difficult to explain their choice of proposers and acknowledgers of
|Toasts? That EARL STANHOPE, by virtue of his literary performances,
| rank, and character, should respond for the Literary Fund was quite
proper. A popular nobleman, and a creditable writer, benevolent and
wealthy, with the means to relieve the wants of needy i.
* *
|
and the will to help the lame dogs of literature over the stile, it wou
be hard to find a better representative than, LoRD STANHope of the
good work the Literary Fund is established, to do, and the spirit in
which it does it. But, when we read that the Toast of Poetry and
Imaginative Literature * was proposed by SIRSTAFFORD NORTHCOTE,
and acknowledged by MR. VENABLEs, Q.C., Mr. Punch must really
ask the Why and Wherefore of the selection. What is the connection
between one of the dryest of Ex-Chancellors of the Exchequer and
Poetry : What has the most matter-of-fact Indian Secretaries, to º
| with “Imaginative Literature?” ... Is it a piece of sly fun poked at
Northcotean Budgets, Home or Indian?--or a slap at the flights of
Indian Estimates, and the fancy shown in building up the income of
India a year in advance, out of such shaky and questionable sources of
gain as Opium Duties? Has MR. DisBAELI's influence so spread, that
Revenue Returns are henceforth to be raised to the dignity of Epic,
and India to be governed, like the Carabas party, in the fine imaginative
spirit of Vivian Grey £ And why should MR. VENABLEs, one of the
| exactest and most hard-headed of leading Parliamentary Counsel, be
| charged to respond on such a theme? Hunless on the ground that,
having found the most unsuitable man in the world to propose the toast,
the Committee was bound to find one still more unsuitable to return
thanks for it, And § LoRD Houghton, who might, with some con-
gruity, have been asked either to propose or respond to SIR STAFFORD
Northcote's toast, was set to propose “the Judges, and Legal
Literature,” except that he once sat as Judge of the Burns-Centenary
Prize Contest, and pronounced sentence on the most prominent offender
in that outrage, we are as much at a loss to imagine, as we are to
understand why CHIEF JUSTICE Boyill, who never, as far as we
know, was guilty of anything more literary than a Charge or a Judg:
ment, and never found his way into print except in the Law Journal
and the Authorised Reports, was chosen to respond to the toast.

THE LAST NEW BALLAD.
MR. PUNCH,
I observe by your last Number that there is a Song just
published with the title “ I will not Ask to Press that Cheek.”. I know
no more of it than the title, and therefore trust I am infringing no
copyright, interfering with no right of translation reserved, in offering
you my notion of what a Ballad with such a title should be.
Yours harmoniously,
ARNE Bishop PURCELL.
P.S.. The Song is a tenor. The statement of this fact will also serve
to indicate to you the sum I shall be contented to receive as an ac-
knowledgment, however inadequate, of the time and labour I have
bestowed on the composition.
“I will not ask to press that cheek,"
Without a guarantee”
That Nature spread the pearl and red
Which there I always see;
Those lustrous lips I will not touch,
Unless you promptly say
That their bright hue is fast and true,
And will not wash away.
Those brilliant eyes may owe their charm
To belladonna's use,
Complexion tints, I’ve heard dark hints,
Are changed by walnut juice;
And if I ask the dearest girl,
For whom alone I live,
For one long tress to kiss and bless,
It mayn't be hers to give.
The pencilled brow, the raven lash,
Are open to a doubt,
And some mistrust, but they ’re unjust,
The shape I rave about :
So in this dubious state of things,
And as the weather's warm,
I will not seek to press that cheek,
Or ask to clasp that form.

UGLY FOR EVER /
AN enameller and painter of women's faces, and cosmetic vender,
who advertises herself as “the great Beautifier to the Royal Courts of
Europe,” and whom we may ºft MADAME JEZEBEL, winds up one of
her horrid puffs by declaring that—
“All other persons endeavouring to copy the beautiful art of which she is the
sole professor, and who are vending dangerous and destructive compounds under
the name of enamels, powders, and liquids, in imitation of her Royal Arabian
Preparations, commit a gross fraud upon ladies.”
And ladies, when they employ MADAME JEzEBEL's Royal Arabian
Preparations to colour their skin and falsify their faces, commit a gross
fraud upon gentlemen. That is to say they commit a gross fraud upon
gentlemen in so, far, as they can deceive any, but there are very few
men so dull of eye as to be unable at a glance to detect a fraudulent
complexion. The ladies who attempt to practise this imposition must
all be purblind, or colour-blind. Otherwise they would need, only a
moment's view in their looking-glasses to see what an unnatural repul-
sive appearance their visages present. All mankind, possessing ordi-
. acuteness of vision, can tell paint, when they see it, from skin;
and, if they could see through it, they would see the skin under it in a
most unwholesome and disgusting state, produced by the operation of
irritating substances and the obstruction of the pores. The continued
application of any sort of plaster to a lady's face for the purpose of
beautifying it can only result in rendering the poor simpleton ugly for
eWer.
Tricksy Spirits.
SPIRITUAL communications, we are told, are sometimes grotesque,
and take the form of practical jokes. . If this is so, spirits are more
conversant with séances than with the bienséances. . Their tricks, it may
be argued, rather tend to prove the truth of spiritualism, as for in-
stance, suppose a spirit pulls your nose. The spirit is probably a
familiar spirit and familiarity doth breed contempt.
A GOOD CUT WITH A WHARNCLIFFE KNIFE.
To LoRD WHARNCLIFFE who, in a speech at the Cutlers' Hall,
Sheffield, very justly described WILLIAM BROADHEAD, the Trades'
unionist and murderer, as a cowardly scoundrel, the fellow has written
an insolent, yet whining letter. This LoRD WHARNGLIFFs notices
thus, addressing the editor of a Sheffield paper:-
“Sir, I enclose for publication a letter from the man whom I designated in my
speech last Tuesday as a cowardly scoundrel—viz., BRoad HEAD.

munication from a sneaking assassin is abhorred by any honest man... I trust,
therefore, to your kindness for the insertion of that man's letter and this one in
your next impression. Your obedient Servant, Whar NCLIFFE."
We are glad to republish this outbreak of manly indignation. And
whereas. BROADHEAD complains that he is attacked now that he is
“ down,” we assure him that all honest men sincerely regret his posi-
tion, and would gladly see him up—say from 8 to 9 A.M., any morning.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Mox Day, May llth. We forget how many times we have had to
write the following record, but here it is again, and we hope the Com-
mercial World is happy. “The Bankruptcy Bill was abandoned for
the Session.” There was no hope of passing it, said LORD CHAN-
çELLOR CAIRNs. What are the interests of ten thousand traders and
five hundred thousand creditors compared to the question whether
DISRAELI or GIADstone shall lead the House of Commons?
No more Public Executions. The Bill has passed both Houses.
LORD RAVENsworth—what reminds us of LoRD BYRON ?
“To and fro, as the nightwinds blow,
The carcase of the assassin swings,
And there alone, on the Raven Stone,
The Raven flaps his dusky wings.”
Because it has nothing to do with the matter—there is no hanging in
chains, no raven, and LoRD RAVENsworth is a very amiable gentle-
man—this inveterate habit of quotation will get us into a scrape some
day. LORD RAVENsworth proposed that all prisoners in a gaol where
execution is done should be obliged to see it. The DUKE of RICH-
MoMD thought that it would be unfair, as there were prisoners of
various degrees of guilt. We suspect that nine-tenths of them will not
thank him for depriving them of a sight, but he was logically right.
And there is an end of the Execution Mob, and the arrangements will
IIl ſº be Academic—a hanging committee, a private view, and press
In Otlees.
LoRD SALISBURY protested against the severity of the Bill for
sending Railway authorities to #. if the accounts should be frau-
dulent, and LQRD CAIRNs, smiling, softened the clause, and made a
guilty knowledge essential. Moreover, it was enacted that a railway
running twenty miles without stopping should be compelled to have
communication between Passengers and Guards. This relieves all the
of the Fatuous Railway Company, that still forbids tobacco).
“COME INTO THE GARDENS, MAUD.”
CoME into the Gardens, MAUD,
Now the bleak east wind has flown,
Come into the Gardens, MAUD,
I shall wait at the gate alone;
For my uncle and aunt are going abroad,
And the day will all be my own.

And the fl. are stuck in the eye;
Beginning I am to fear that my love's
Afraid of a showery sky,
To fear for the feast of the monkey she loves
On the bun I’ve just been to buy.

There’s a sound of a Hansom near—
It has stopped at the entrance gate;
She is coming, my duck, my dear,
She is coming, though rather late;
The brown bear dances like mad, like mad,
And the kangaroo lengthens his jump,
The parrots scream out ‘‘so glad, so glad,”
And the camel distinctly says “ Humpſh) !”
She is coming (from Harley Street),
With her juvenile brother, FRED,
A belle who is hard to beat,
As the men in the Gardens said;
A girl who is hard to beat,
rom the little excuse on her head
To the little bottines on her feet—
And I know that I’m turning red.

A Mighty Lively Concern,
THE Irish bishops and archbishops, in the address which
they presented the other day to the QUEEN, say “we have
the strongest confidence that nothing which affects the
well-being of the Irish branch of our United Church can
be other than of liveliest concern to your MAJESTY.”
Now, on the contrary, is it not likely that the QUEEN
regards the Irish Church question, as a matter of the
gravest concern ?, With the exception of the persona-
lities interchanged between MR. DISRAELI and MR.
BRIGHT, which were extremely diverting, the debate on
that subject at least has been anything but lively.
“STRONG
already fitted with such things will not, therefore, be dismantled. The
larger º: population using a line, the more chance of meeting ruffians
or lunatics.
MR. CoRRY and Navy Estimates in the Nether House. Estimates
a good bit over Eleven Millions of golden sovereigns. Criticism by
MR. CHILDERs, but not a halfpenny taken off, beloved MRs. GRUNDY.
Tuesday. The Guardians of Guildford have imbibed an idea in the
interest of virtue. They think that no one is entitled to poor-law
relief, if he or she happens to be an unvirtuous character. ... Of course,
if we could carry out this Arcadian view, and obliterate all folks who
are at once poor and evil, it would be very charming; but as the law
ordains that, virtuous or not, a pauper shall not be starved to death;
we fear that the sun of Guildford charity will have to shine on the evil
and on the good. The question was raised in the Lords, and the
Guardians were pronounced, wrong, but LoRDs REDESDALE and
Overstone warn us against the increase of vagrous men.
Architecture gives our magnates a deal of trouble. The selection of
a law Courts architect has got into a dreadful muddle, and the
ATToRNEY-GENERAL has been called in as umpire—his decision is
awaited. As regards the new National Gallery, things are worse, for
LoRD JoHN MANNERs cannot make up his mind what architect to
employ. Considering that Mr. Punch has already furnished about a
dozen designs, and that the architect has only to carry out one of
them, LoRD JoHN had better say which, and take the first name that
comes out of a hat.
In the Lords this day and in the Commons on the next, there was
discussion on the Metric System of Weights and Measures, which is
adopted by nearly all other civilised nations, but which it is good clap-
trap to resist, call un-English, and otherwise abuse, and those who
seek the admiration of the stupid bid for it highly in this case. But
the Commons voted in MR. EwART's Bill, by 217 to 65, which has
rather raised the Commons in Mr. Punch's esteem.
HER MAJESTY, addressed on the Irish Church, has been advised to
short London trains from any such necessity, but we hope that those
make the very gracious and very wise reply, that The QUEEN desires

that her interest in the temporalities shall not stand in the way of the coº-
sideration by Parliament of any measure that may be introduced in the
present Session. -
Land groaned that it was taxed too much, and MR. MILL admitted
that for some of the groaning, but not all, there might be reason, but
then the value of .# had increased hugely.
Wednesday. MR. ColeRIDGE, in an eloquent speech, moved the
second reading of his Bill for doing away with religious tests at the
Universities. MR. WALPOLE made the º: plea on behalf of what
he, honestly enough, considers religion, and a new Member, MR. WIN-
TERBoth AM, for Stroud, made an able speech, and, as a dissenter,
begged that the exclusive rules might be done away, for though dis-
senting clergymen were very pious and all that, they really were not
i. and they wanted academic advantages. The hours of adjourn-
ment came while some champion of the Church was talking.
Thursday. The weather was so splendidly hot that the Lords steeped
their senses in cool Sea fisheries, and sº. of splashing waves and
deep waters. Happy for them that legislation and luxury could be sq
pleasantly combined. Lord Punch pulled his coronet over his eyes, and
thought of MR. Hook's pictures until he smelt the refreshing spray.
Then he fell asleep, and dreamed that he had got into a refrigerator
and was utterly refusing to come out to dinner. When he woke, he
heard the words “Irish Education,” and the double idea was too much
for him—so he made tracks. -
MR. MILL presented to the Commons, a petition signed by 21,757
women, who asked for the Franchise. The first signature was that of
MRs. Somerville, Mechanist of the Heavens, the second that of
Miss FLORENCE Nightingale, Healer on Earth. Right or wrong, the
request ought to have been granted to such petitioners.
Complaint was made against the 200 to 300 Iron Gates which close
divers streetsin London. We actually pay for repairing these contrivances
for hindering our drives. There are too many vested interests to be
got through without the aid of Rebecca and her Daughters, whom we
shall be happy to hear of in town. After the Hyde Park railings,
there can be no railings against those ladies. The block in Park Lane,
a thoroughfare judiciously selected to be shut up during the time that
it is most wanted, was also declaimed against, and early redress was
promised. All is for the best, there is nothing like showing the in-
fluential classes the brainlessness of those to whom at present we
| confide our local government. -
The Honour ABLE MAJoR STUART KNOx began to be bumptious
about the Suspensory Bill, and gave sweet promise of the fun he was
to cause later.
We were then asked to go into Committee on the Boundaries Bill,
and MR. GLADstone pointed out a good many reasons for dissatisfaction
with divers recommendations of the Commissioners, but would not
hinder the Bill if the Government would be reasonably elastic.
The PREMIER thought that with patience and temper the Bill might
be made satisfactory, as no question of party policy was involved.
Mr. Punch apologises for having winked at this moment—his wink only
meant that sundry of the proposed arrangements might not be found to
be exactly hostile to the . interests of the Conservative party.
MR. BRIGHT was for referring the principal objections to a Com-
mittee of Seven.
MR. Russell, GURNEy, one of the Commissioners, said that they had
looked on the Bill as an Enfranchising measure, and therefore had
looked outside boroughs for voters to be brought into them.
The PREMIER consented to a Committee of Five, who should con-
sider petitions against the proposals, and should take documentary
evidence only.
MR. BERNAL Osborne wanted to know a little more about what was
to be done, but he asked it humbly, recognising the terrible power
which MR. DISRAELI had to deal with a refractory House.
Finally the suggested arrangement was accepted, and the House re-
sumed and got upon the Estimates. A great quantity of miscellaneous
wisdom was poured forth about the new law courts, Aberdeen theology,
the Regent's Park lake, the statues in Westminster Hall, the ladies'
gallery, the Members’ grotto under Westminster Bridge, the unjust
way in which DANIEL MACLISE has been treated (whereof more another
time), OLIVER CRomwell, and other interesting topics, and MR.
Osborne was beaten by 234 to 76 on the question of refusing the vote
for the pedestals of the above-mentioned statues.
MR. GLADstone moved for leave to bring in a Bill for Suspending
Appointments in the Irish Church.
The Honour ABLE MAJoRSTUART Knox in opposition began to read
a quotation from a speech which asserted that the Irish Church could
never be overthrown but by a recreant Senate and an apostate nation.
MR. GLADston E. Whom are you quoting
The Honour ABLE MAJoR STUART KNox. You.
MR. GLADston E. Where P
The HonourabLE MAJor STUART KNOx moved that the debate be
adjourned for six months.
MR. GLADSTONE. But what are you quoting from ?
The HonourABLE MAJOR STUART KNox. Partly from your speech
in 1845, no,1835, and partly from your work published in 1841. You
were not a boy then, ou know. -
MR. GIADstone. No, but I want a reference. I don’t believe I ever
said anything of the kind. That's right, LoRD CLAUDE HAMILTON,
do help him to find out the passages.
After some discussion, a friend of MR. GLADstone's helped him to
the passage lastly quoted, and he read it and the context with mis-
chievous emphasis, the Conservatives loudly cheering the sentiments.
Then MR. GLADSTONE said,
“The speech was made by MR. WHITESIDE.”
The Honour ABLE MAJOR STUART Knox, amid the roars of the House,
thanked MR. GLADSTONE for “corroborating ” him, and having made
several efforts to speak, and having been put down by the SPEAKER,

Mr. Punch missed this fun, having long previously departed to join
the PRINCE and PRINCEss of WALEs at the Royal Italian Opera, and
to enjoy MADEMOISELLE LUCCA's adorable personation of the heroine
in Fra Diavolo, a work which never seemed fresher or more sparkling
than in this year's edition at Covent Garden. He took the opportunity
of complimenting the Prince on his capital speeches at the St. Bartho.

Shored up.
MR. SERJEANT ARMSTRong gave notice that he should on the 25th
vote that he had No Confidence in Ministers. This Armstrong will
probably be spiked.
Among the miscellanea of the Friday Conversazione was a debate
ºn a Motion, by SIR. C. QLogBLEN for an Address, requesting the
QUEEN occasionally to reside in Ireland. The Leaders of the House
and of the Opposition were exceedingly gracious, in their replies, and
all sorts of proper things were said, after which the Motion was with-
drawn. The Times points out that SIR WALTER Scott invented Scot-
land, and induced PRINCE ALBERT, and through him, the QUEEN, to go
thither, and suggests that Ireland should get some genius to invent
that country. But let it be noted that, whereas Scott lauded his
country, and nearly all the dwellers therein, Irish writers tell us of
nothing but gloomy scenery, murdered gaugers, profligate landlords,
cunning and savage peasants, haughty parsons, and vulgar priests.
That’s not the way to bring people into ireland.
FREEDOM IN THE FREE KIRK.
. According to the Scotsman, one MR.PETER CLARK, of North Knapdale,
in Argyle, has incurred the censure of the local Free Kirk Session for
“the sin of dancing.” The Rev. MR. FERquson, MR. CLARR's pastor,
is going to bring his case before the general assembly of the Free Kirk,
with a view to obtain a decision on the question whether dancing is
sinful...The meaning of the word “Free,” in connection with Kirk.”
is peculiar. The Free Kirk does not mean a Kirk or Church of which
the members are in any sense free, but one whereof the clerical body
is free to impose decrees on all the rest. In this respect the Free
Kirk of Scotland resembles the Church of Rome as closely as an
anthropoid ape does a human being. Only, according to the Darwinian
theory of development, the ape was the original animal, whereas the
Free Kirk is not the prior institution. Should it decide that dancing
is a sin, it will play a sort of monkey's trick, imitating the papal decla-
ration of a new dogma. - -
. The Free Kirk is notoriously ultra-Sabbatarian. Its Sabbatarianism
is based wholly on its own authority, which if any of those who belong
to it wish to dispute, they will have a capital opportunity of doing so
should it condemn dancing. Instead of sitting and stupefying them-
selves with whiskey in-doors on a Sunday, they could come out, lads
and lasses, and have a dance on the green, or any other open space
they may find suitable, and thus assert their Christian liberty against
the dictation of the Free Kirk in two particulars at once.

A scIENTIFIC friend, visiting the National Portrait Exhibition, was

A NATURAL. QUERY.
Conductor. “WILL ANY GENTLEMAN RIDE Outside To Oblige A LADY 1"
Obliging Gentleman. “WITH PLEAsuBE
BAD FOOD FOR THE MIND.
AT Bow Street, one day last week, Mr. Punch, two boys, cousins,
John BARRETT, aged 14, and Edward BARRETT, aged 13, were com-
mitted for trial by SIRTHoMAs HENRY on a charge of burglary. The
father of the former of these young thieves “said the prisoners had
been led astray in consequence of their minds being perverted by
reading novels, published in penny numbers, in which the heroes are
highwaymen, burglars, and other thieves and criminals.” Every now
and then, Sir, you read in the Police Reports of so much putrid or
diseased meat, fish, or other provision, seized and ordered to be
destroyed, as unfit for human food, the person guilty of exposing it for
sale being sometimes also fined, and sent to prison; Gould not a law
in like manner prevent or punish the publication and sale of pernicious
literature as unfit to be food for the mind?
Look into almost any news-shop window in the poorer neighbour-
hoods, and there you will see the romance of ruffianism inviting pur-
chase in profusion. Its nature is indicated by illustrations; ten or a
dozen, perhaps, adorning so many tales of villanous fiction or actual
crime. In each of these some one, evidently meant for a hero, or
interesting personage, is represented committing some sort of depreda-
tion or outrage—piracy, burglary, highway robbery, garotting, assault
with intent to murder, or murder, in fact... Somebody in almost every
print you see, striking an attitude, is discharging a pistol at, or
plunging a dagger into, somebody else, or cutting somebody else’s
throat, or hewing down, jumping and stamping upon somebody else, or
battering his or her brains out. Was it not a Saint who said that
pictures were the books of idiots .*.*. merely the illiterate.
The pictures, in low news-shop windows are books that even a born
idiot may understand; he who runs may read them: and they consti-
tute the education of our street Arabs.

and art specifically Fº Could not its provisions be extended

public by the employment of equivocal titles. A paragraph, headed
‘Spirit Movements,” lately appeared in the Times, and attracted a
great number of readers, who expected to find in it some information

LFRED TENNYSON, ESQ., Poet Laureate, in his new and
beautiful poem, Lucretius, describes, with subtle art, the working
of a §. philtre administered to the Roman poet by a lady who
foolishly believed his affection withdrawn from her, and wished to regain
it. Exquisitely the English poet says-
“The wicked broth
Confused the chemic labour of the blood,
And tickling the brute brain within the man's
Made havoc among those tender cells.”
Poetry and º were never married with a finer, result. But
there are other than love-poisons, and other than love philtres, and if
the public knew how poisonous is the water they drink, and how
wholesome it can be rendered by Messrs. Crystal's filters, they would
at once apply at No. 50, Fountain Street, Pond Road, E.C. l
ALLANT DR. LIVINGSTONE'S return to his native country
is now expected with the utmost impatience, and in the words of
his faithful friend, Sir Roderick Wich Murchison, ho, ieroe, “we count
the minutes” until we hail the presence of the noble adventurer. Those
who desire to count the minutes accurately, should procure the new
fººt watch manufactured by Messrs. Clicker & Spring, Ticker's

HAT DISTINGUISHED MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL, the
Rev. C. H. Spurgeon, at the meeting of the Liberation Society,
bore testimony to the temper of the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, a
temper which, considering his provocations, is regarded by Mr. Spur-
§. as quite as good as can be expected. The zealous and indefatigable
aptist pastor would have borne a still warmer, tribute to the temper
of Grinder & Pivott's knives and scissors, had he paid a visit to their
world-famous manufactory, Steel Yard, Cutler's Street.
HE IS MARRIED.—Who? Why, La Diva PATTI, who made her
first appearance this season as Rosina, in Rossini's delightful
Barbiere. That is, the secular marriage has taken place, but the vows
at the altar will not be exchanged until the charming songstress shall
have delivered her last lyric vow over the orchestra. Happy Marquis

..Such is the question now agitating the Anglican communion.
While it is to be deplored that such a cause of quarrel should inflame

NALFABETL-This mellifluous word is probably unknown to the

to be counted by the million among us. It indicates the Italians who

St. Cadmus, and sold at all the offices of the A.B.C. Railway Guide.
R. BUCKSTONE AS LAGO, for the farewell benefit of Mr. Paul
Bedford, on Saturday, the 16th May, is a very suggestive persona-

AR WITH PRUSSIA is apparently,the intention of the Em-
peror of the French, for though, as Emile de Girardin has observed,
words say No, facts say Yes. Fearful will be the responsibility of a
potentate who without any just cause or impediment plunges two vast
nations into the vortex of combat, and while increasing the financial
burdens of his country diminishes the number of persons who bear them.
But it is the dutyof all to be prepared for the vicissitudes offoreign affairs,
and at this moment Berlin wool is at a price which encourages invest-
ment. Apply to Messrs. Kettle, Holder, & Slippers, 15, Woolpack Lane.
WHQ SHALL DECIDE when doctors disagree ? Great Punch's
answer is, refer to Me, and the advice is marked by his usual
boldness, and wisdom. But there are times when even the supreme
skill of the philosopher of Fleet Street fails to relieve the patient who
repiningly beholds himself made the corpus rile for the experiments of
quacks, basely fumbling in the dark, and inserting drugs of which they
know little, into a body of which they knownothing. At such a moment
the Balsam of Timbuctoo, prepared only by the lawful wives of the
Emperor of that region, is the true remedy, and it, may be procured
in large or small bottles at Fur & Mendax's, Swindleton Road,
Knavesmire.
W HAT THE QUEEN SAID to Mr. Disraeli, when he asked her
leave to dissolve, is the subject of speculation, but will probably
never be known until that versatile author publishes his Curiosities of
Politics. While all are equally in the dark, it is lawful to all to venti-
late suggestion, and it is quite possible that Her sty may have re-
commended the Premier to call at No. 2, Liquorpond Row, Yorkshire
Stingo, and take a ham or beef sandwich and a glass of prime old
stunning ale, for fourpence. , But if the hint was not given by the
Sovereign, it is now given by her loyal servants, the proprietors, to
the Premier, and also to the People.
HQULD THE WORD implying excess of joy be spelt Ecstasy or

heavy bet has been laid at one of the leading clubs: Some persons rely

of the words, we will observe that bumps, as also bruises, sprains,

CHAPTER XXII.
An OLD FRIEND.
THE hand which had griped PIEL DoRNTON round the ancle was
not to be shaken' off easily. - ---
Bess failed to take advantage of his helpless position, and was only
too glad to welcome Joseph, as the young man sprang up, through the
hole in the earth, from the cavern where he had been secreted. He
had been climbing the cliffs, in the pursuit of his usual occupation,
when his attention had been arrested by the girl's cry for assistance,
and he had at once dashed into the recess and so gained the entrance.
“PIEL DoRNTON,” said the young sailor, “this is my betrothed.
You have riches, no matter how you came by them, you have houses
and lands, but dare to injure so much as a hair of the head of this
trembling girl, and your sacred calling shall prove no protection to you,
PIEL DoRNTON grasped his pistol.
. In another moment a gaunt spectral form, partly appeared from the
inner chamber, and rising from the low pallet—
The Authors engaged on this part of the Novel to the Blitor-So, at last we're going

utterance to his º feelings.
The Clergyman was foiled. He did not at once see his plan of action.

BEss was hardened to most things, but this allusion to her father
came so sharply and rudely upon her ear, that for a moment she could
only attempt to gather his meaning.
“Do you wish to see him f* asked Joseph.
“I do,” replied PIEL DoRNTON, savagely. “You shall have his last
word, ay, if it be the last he should speak, on this earth, for the
solemn promise he made me. Your triumph will be short, young
man. Come, come !”
They descended the hill.
Still following in his track came the Child of Destiny.
“He is mine ! mine !” he whispered to himself.
A light shone from the cottage window, as they tapped at the door.

T-
Taking the advantage thus offered him, Joseph shook him off and
descended the staircase.
On his way out he passed a crouching form in a dark corner. That
form was his good genius; it was DoRNToN's evil genius. The infant.
It was a rugged and perilous descent down the steepest part of the
cliff to where the papers were hidden in a hole in the rock. . .
He looked over the edge, and saw a white strip fluttering in the
breeze. In an instant he had decided.
While Joseph was thus engaged PIEL DoRNTon was alone with old
MARTIN, for BEss, seeing that her father was unable any longer to go
out fishing for a livelihood (he had always caught one #. in the
neighbourhood) had taken his boat, and nets, and bait carefully pre:
served in moss, and had gone out to win the support which was needed
for their evening meal and the next day's dinner.
PIEL DoRNTon was alone with old MARTIN.
... The papers!” shouted PIE.L.DoRNTON in the dying man's ear.
“Don’t | Don’t l” said old MARTIN, who was sinking fast, getting
under the bed clothes and kicking feebly.
Seeing this muscular demonstration, PIEL DoRNToN, who, as has
already been shown, was something of a physician, at once saw that
he was near his last. A bucket was in the room, used probably for
the preservation of the fish after they’d been caught. this he carefully
removed from within reach of the old man’s feet.

CHAPTER XXIV.
NETT PROFIT.
TEN miles out at sea sat. Bess MARTIN laboriously toiling. No fish,
except a few of those hybrids between bird of the might and flying-fish,
intitled Tittlebats, had come to her net. She thought of her father, she
thought of everything, and everybody. -
Then she felt a jerk at her floats. The net bobbed, it was as much
as she could do to hold it. At last, after much struggling,t she hauled
it into the boat. At first, by the light of the crescent moon, it was diffi-
cult to see what monstrous creature this was twirling among the hooks.
At last as the clouds cleared off, and the moon again shone forth, the
night was as clear as a summer's day. - -
Then she clasped her hands above her head. In the Net was a man
writhing.
“Joseph " ' " she exclaimed.
He tore through the cords which held him, and telling her of PIEL
DoRNTON's dastardly attempt, pressed her to his arms.
“Saved Saved ſ” she exclaimed.
He would have returned to shore at once with the papers, which
they then examined carefully, but unfortunately to very little purpose,
neither of them having had those extra advantages of education
which include a towel, spoon, and fork, and the alphabet, in at all
events its ordinary form, exclusive of capital letters.
They wept; tears of joy.
Then said she, “You must not return; he will kill you.”
“If he will do that, I will not return,” he said, boldly.
“But where is a place of safety?” he asked.
She shook her head.
A light streamed across the ocean.
“Ha!” she exclaimed. “I see it.”
“So do I,” said Joseph.
In a second it struck them both.

SCIENCE APPLIED TO THE POLITICAL ARTS.
I. TO DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT.
THERE are two descriptions of Parliament, one perfectly transparent
and insipid, the other dark and full of impurities. According to the
qualitative analysis of some eminent chemists, common Parliament, that
is the Parliament of commerce, is composed of
Ministerial Warnish,
Soft Soap,
Gum Benjamin, and
Colouring Matter.
From gum Benjamin Parliament is supposed to derive its adhesive
properties. This substance, though not possessing, any peculiar con-
|sistency, is wonderfully plastic, and may be moulded into any form by
patient manipulation. It is, however, capable of resisting considerable
| pressure, and while it is itself with difficulty displaced, is said to have
the somewhat anomalous power, in combination with Queen's metal, of
dissolving all bodies to which it is opposed.
Who has not observed with admiring interest how the sensitive
atoms of Parliament are held in suspense, sometimes for weeks, by an
occult influence which when in motion resembles fine dust, producing
violent irritation and intolerable dizziness *
II. ELECTORAL AFFINITIES.
Gold is an universal political solvent, specially remarkable for its
electoral affinities. Administered by an expert hand, tumid indepen;
dence is speedily reduced, and if largely employed, decomposition of all
the electoral tissues supervenes. When the auriferous wires of a
º club battery are brought in contact with the Poll, which,
or this purpose, may be considered as an inexhaustible receiver, the
Poll becomes positively electrified with venal avidity, the whole body
surrounding the Poll, being charged with a subtle fluid technically
called craft. - -
Decomposed electoral tissue is always very offensive, and causes
faintness among young practitioners if exhibited in the House.
- A New song to an Old Tune.

A CLERICAL TONE.
THE ARchbishop of CANTERBURY, the other day, told the deputa-
tion which waited upon him with a memorial praying him to oppose
the Universities Tests Bill, that “he should do all in his, power, to
maintain the religious tone of the clergy and ministers.” In this
determination his Grace is to be commended-with some reserve.
There is a tone which, being adopted by some of the clergy in the
reading-desk and in the pulpit, but especially in the pulpit, may be
called religious, but which the Archbishop should do all in his power
not to maintain but to terminate. A certain class of reverend gentle-
men, thinking to read prayers, or to preach, impressively as the re-
porters say, and, from natural vulgarity, uncorrected by drill in
elocution, not knowing how, are accustomed to recite the service, or
deliver their discourses, in a moaning tone of voice, which instead of
being impressive is ridiculous. A preacher had better intone his sermon
than hold forth in such a tone as that...The ARCHBishop of CANTER-
Bury will do well to deprecate this canting sort of utterance.

POLITICAL PARLANCE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH. . . . -
How delightful it is to be able to converse with Politicians !
I often wish I were, not a butterfly nor a bird—nothing so ridiculous—
but an Electress!...That’s a new, word, Mr. Punch; but it will be
required soon, you’ll see, if things go on merrily with our dear little
.." When the wind blows, then—” you know the rest; and
every little puff is of service in keeping it in motion. But, dear Mr.
Punch, sometimes I tremble at the very thought of my impending
responsibility, for I am so dreadfully ignorant of Parliamentary chat.
Qf course, I know perfectly well what is going on in the “Deliberative
Assembly” (as it is sometimes pleasantly designated) near Westminster
Hall. How can it be otherwise, when every week.you so kindly set
before your, grateful guests that “Essence of Parliament” which is
so nicely adapted to please every lady's taste, however exigeant it
may be
§: what I cannot comprehend are the technical terms with which
you, Mr. Punch, are so charmingly conversant. For instance, how
funny it seems for people to resolve to read something “this day six
months.” If it be worth ...i. all, why not read it at once, and
have done with it? I doubt whether a novel would be allowed to
“lie on the table” so long uncut.
Then, again, some honourable Member, at his wit’s end to bother a
pertinacious opponent, moves a curious obstacle in his way, which he
calls “the previous question,” but never dreams of telling any one
what the question is. Before EDMUND (not the Confessor, but my
EDMUND) popped the momentous question to me, the previous question
he put to my little brother PETER was—a most ridiculous one, to be
sure, but it shows what importance men attach to anything that grati-
fies their senses—“Did CICELY ever make a custard pudding ** That
was his “previous question;” but EDMUND is a little bit of an artist,
and I have heard if you wish to impress a painter's heart, you must
show a lively interest in his palate.
I half suspect the “previous question” is, “Would MR, SPEAKER
like to recline on the sofa P” an inquiry which would naturally precede
the ordinary proposal that “MR. SPEAKER do leave the Chair;” a
3. which however uncomfortable, I suppose he can only occupy
uring the suspension of the “Standing Orders.”
. As the essence of female curiosity is a laudable desire for mental
improvement, º s, Mr. Punch, you will some day introduce into

HINTS FOR DERBY TALKERS.
|
Trou inform me, my dear
GERALD, in a letter which
you omitted to prepay,
that you are going to for-
sake the study of the law
... on Wednesday, the 27th,
to accompany your ſel-
low-student, MARKBAM
CLINTon, his sister and
cousin, and hamper, in
the family barouche, to
Epsom Downs; and you
ask me to supply you
with some materials for
conversation on the way,
telling me, as one of your
trustees, that you are de-
sirous to secure the good
opinion of your friend's
sister (photograph enclo-
sed), who is two-and-
twenty, of prepossessing
exterior – your expres-
sion, not mine—and the
- favourite niece of an aunt
with funded property, in delicate health and Dorsetshire.
Having known you from your perambulator, and being anxious to
see you settled in life, and a roomy house, I am ready to comply with
your wishes, and be your “Guide to the Turf,” and will do for you
what I have done for millions in previous years in these pages—a testi-
monial, I am told, is in contemplation, the minimum subscription
five guineas, and the substantial acknowledgment an épergne and an oil
portrait—run through the names of the principal competitors for the
great stakes, and prime you with some stable talk, avoiding technicali-
ties, imparting useful information, and abstaining from any attempt to
waticinate the Winner of the Derby of 1868, which the newspapers are
sure to say was more numerously attended than on any previous occa-
sion, although I have it on the tip of my tongue to put you up to some-
thing which my man told me he heard from his cousin, who is engaged
to the sister of the brother of one of the helpers in the – stable.
Place aur Dames / Lady Elizabeth. (No indirect opinion is meant to
be conveyed that the filly is sure to get a place.) A safe Bet, her
backers say—a good Bet, all will say who have money on the mare
from a florin to a rent-roll, happy as the Day is long, when the Battle
of Hastings is over, and the Elizabethan style has thousands of hoarse
admirers, provided she passes the Judge's chair first, if only by an
eyebrow. I halt a moment to express my conviction that of all duties,
a Government Whip's alone excepted, those of a racing Judge must be
the most delicate and difficult.
Rosicrucian. BLANCHE and her cousin Is ABEL will be sure to ply
you with searching questions, which your University education may
fail to enable you to answer. Who was Rosicrucian * What was
Rosicrucian P Why is a horse called Rosicrucian P L will therefore
deal you out a little of my encyclopaedic information, that you may
pass your examination creditably. The Rosicrucians, then, were a sect
of philosophers (according to their admirers), of impostors (according
to their enemies) who filled the daily papers, and got involved in law-
suits about five-and-a-half hundred years ago, pretending, amongst
other things (see bills of the day in the British Museum), that they
possessed the secret of the philosopher's stone, a contrivance for
changing the inferior metals—tin, copper, electro-plate, &c.—into gold.
If you, my dear GERALD, have money on the horse, and he wins, you
will be a sincere believer in the power of a Rosicrucian to produce
sovereigns such as the Master of the Mint cannot beat; but if he
loses, you will, with the satiric literature of the time in which the sect
flourished, show him up as an impostor. -
Blue Gown. You will find your fair travelling companions (by the
way, I cannot be certain, from the photograph, whether she is light or
dark : if the former, l shall use the freedom of calling her likeness a
carte Blanche) very much interested in this steed, its name suggesting
millinery and dress-making observations, which, if you wish to have
rational conversation, you must instantly suppress. May SIR Joseph
HAwley's lot in life and Surrey be happy! Yet there are sceptics
who insist that the Derby is “not for Joseph’—a quotation from a
classical author º: Macmillan for May—Article, “Lucretius”) irre-
sistible, but indefensible.
Paul Jones. Who is he? Is he in society? BLANCHE the blonde,
and Isa B&L the brunette, will test your academical knowledge with a
co-operative curiosity which you may find embarrassing. Narrate,
therefore, when the lobster blushes and the Moselle sparkles with
delight, and the glove business is uncommonly brisk, as follows:–
Distinguished political economist; founder of the Utilitarian school in
the Black Forest; in favour of marriage with a deceased wife's sister;
WOL. LIV. Z
invented the corkscrew and the Shoeblack Brigade; Knight of the
Hare and Tortoise; died at sea; monument in Westminster Abbey.
Speculum. Have you backed this horse * Then, if he lands his
ducal owner's colours first—you will observe by my phraseology that I
have been reading sporting papers lately, night and day—he will prove
a good Spec.; if he is in the ruck, wherever that may be, you will
denounce him as a bad Specul(um)ation. Another glass of Moselle, if
you please, after that.
Tom Bowline Colt. How can a horse expect to run away with
stakes of the value of £5,678, or something of the sort, when he has
not even taken the trouble to provide himself with a name of his own f
If you are pecuniarily interested, retain some spiritualist to cross-
examine the late MR. CHARLEs DIBDIN as to his estimate of T. B.
Junior's chance, and get M.R. SIMs Reeves to sing his praises, and
tell you whether “Bowline” ought not to be “Bowling.”
Green Sleeve. See observations on Blue Gown.
Orion. Read up astronomy, mythology, and quote from MR.
HoRNE's poem; also compose a parody on “Beautiful Star” and
recite it in the barouche coming home, if this constellation, or Sign of
the Zodiac, or galaxy, or whatever the Astronomer Royal would call
it, is in the ascendant, and shoots a-head of all terrestrial competitors,
carrying off the prize to the skies where he will be received with a
“perfect ovation,” and have addresses presented to him,
Pace. I think I understood that you had drawn him in a sweep-
stakes : if so, let us hope he will ge the pace.
St. Ronan. The title of one of Scott's novels (you have heard of
SIR WALTER Scott, I believe f) will rise to the lips of the backers of
this the last horse I shall embalm for posterity, if he wins—St.
Ronan's well !
I shall find the barouche out. Don't forget the truffles in the
ie. You will know me by the ruffles on my shirt. If any one of the
orses puts money into your pocket, show your gratitude to the noble
animal by vowing never to eat him, or any other courser.

MEMORANDUM ON MILITARY ECONOMY.
THE only serious, argument against the abolition of purchase in the
Army, proposed in Parliament by, MR. THEvely AN, is that the country
will have to pay handsomely for that reform. In connection with the
increase of payment which will be thereby entailed, your economists
may consider another department of warlike expenditure. They have
been informed by the Times that :—
“A charge of powder and shot rarely cost above 15s. ; now every shot from a
9-inch gun costs at least £4 5s., and from the 12-inch gun about £7 12s. Many
varioties of projectiles cost a great deal more. The ammunition alone required to
test a 9-inch gun costs £1,300. In 1860 it cost only £150. We are now making
12-inch * and if it costs £1,300 to test a 9-inch gun, it will cost £2,000 to test
a 12-inch."
From the same authority economical legislators may learn that shells
cost £7 12s. each; from £7 12s. perhaps we should rather say. Now
only fancy firing our modern iſ: on these terms—blazing away at
this rate in vain The expense of military projectiles and ordnance
may be less than that of naval, but is more than heavy enough to make
its prevention, or diminution to the smallest possible amount, very
desirable. Howbeit no such expense, if necessary, can be spared.
The object, therefore, to be accomplished in warfare is that of having
the greatest possible number of enemies, or amount of mischief, to
show for the money which goes in every shot, and still more in eve, ,
shell. To this end the shooting must be got over by victory as so ºn
as possible. That requires the most efficient officers we can procu-
Let promotion, then, go not by purchase, but by merit, which will cost
à. much less than you will otherwise throw away in powder and

DENSITY AND DIRTY WATER.
At the approaching Handel Festival, some that have ears will hear
that wonderful Chorus in Israel in Kaypt, “They Ioathed to Drink of
the River.” So, the hearers may think, might the British public. In a
summary of the Registrar-General's report for 1866, thus says the
Times:—
“DR. FARR has to state that there is no apparent evidence of decline in the rate
of death from fever. He considers it exceedingly probable that typhoid fever is
sustained by increasing contamination of the waters, and typhus by the increased
density of the population.”
No doubt the increased density of the population is what chiefly
sustains both typhus and typhoid ſever. The increasing contamination
of the waters is caused by the increased density of the population
whose towns are drained into them. That density is double; not only
physical but moral; and it is moral density that pollutes the streams
of England, making them flow with slops, and sewage, and the slush
of chemical works. Owing to this density the fish are perishing in the
rivers and the flowers on their banks. It is a density worse than
PETER BELL’s in effect; for the primrose on the river's brim had at
least an existence for PETER, and he saw that it was yellow, whereas,
from our population of increased density, that primrose has mostly
disappeared; and, where it does here and there occur, it looks whity-
brown. But if the increasing density of the population causes des-
tructive, fevers, the moral density must in a considerable measure
operate in diminishing the physical. That is to say, it must thin the
population. Were this density rarefied by needful culture, would not
its rarefaction bring the death-rate down f
This is a question that may be deemed worthy of attention by prac-
tical gentlemen accustomed to stigmatise solicitude for the conservation
of pure streams, pretty flowers, and the beauties of nature at large, in
any degree of contrariety to material progress as “sentiment.” Čaii
it sentiment, Gentlemen, if you will; this sentiment is a difference |th
between you and some of our humble servants: it also distinguishes
them from the lower animals. It is a weakness which you are exempt
from, eh? So is the ass.

THE DEAR CREATURES.
LADIEs, look at this description of how one of you was dressed at a
late ball in Paris, a ball which probably did not begin till midnight,
and may therefore very fitly be referred to as a late one:–
“Instead of a necklace of precious stones, she wore a garland of flowers à la
Parabëre. Her blond hair was relieved behind, straight from the roots: with
neither chignon nor nattes; the hair attached at the summit of the head, and ter-
minating in bows. Several roses were fastened in the hair in a very graceful
manner."
A punster might protest that a lady without mattes hardly could look
natty; but wiser persons will reflect upon the wisdom of a woman who
wears neither mattes nor chignon which in any way may hide the beauty
of her neck. They will rejoice, moreover, to learn that in these days
of over-dressing and extravagance, there is still living a lady who
“instead of a necklace,” has the taste to wear a simple garland ot
flowers. Surely, they will say, a jewel of a woman needs no jewellery
for ornament, Good looks require no diamonds, as good wine needs
no bush. A bright eye far, outshines the sparkle of a ruby; a white
skin has a beauty far more brilliant than a pearl.
Pearls however are still worn by the swellesses of Paris, and worn
in great profusion, as the following will prove:-
“Another lady had a very peculiar kind of headdress; she was literally covered
with pearls."
A lady covered with pearls must be really a dear creature, in respect
of the enormous lot of money she must cost. We pity the poor man,
unless he be as rich as Croesus, whose wife goes out to dances with her
head covered with pearls. We wonder how many she loses on an
average each evening, and whether she drops more in a gallop or a
waltz. To dance with such a woman must really, to our thinking, be
a dangerous adventure; for if a handful of her pearls were to fall into
one's pocket, her husband might suspect one of intending to pearl-oin

“WHAT, You HERE, MY DEAR Mr. BRUMMLE |
IF WE HAD ONLY KNOWN 1
WHY, You MIGHT HAVE CHAPERONED ME, AND Poor
PAPA MiGHT HAVE STAYED AT Home !”
MAGNETISM OF THE HORSE.
WHATEveR, Mr. Punch, may be your opinion about Mesmerism,
you will doubtless admit that, in a certain sense, there is some reality
in a species of animal magnetism; a magnetic force which attracts
some people to some animals. Not to mention mere pets, dogs and
horses may, for example, be said to be animal magnets, or magnetic
animals. The magnetic *. of the horse, especially, are wonder-
ful, in the extreme. What attraction the creature has for the multi-
tude, what fascination for most, and how, it possesses some people
with downright infatuation!, Permit me, this racing week, to quote a
few lines from your friend “ARGUs":—
“Still, faulty and ruinous as the conduct of the MARQUIs of HASTINGs must be
admitted to have been, and for which, as I have said before, I am no apologist, it is
only right the public should know, before they condemn him so severely as they
have done, the sacrifices he has made for the maintenance of his credit. In the first
º: he has disposed of bis Racehorses, his Hunters, his Hounds, his Hacks, the
eversion to Donnington, and his London estate. . In addition, he was absolutely
forcing into the market the other securities he had to offer to meet his difficulties
when they had come to a crisis, as he felt them at the time very keenly.”
The liabilities which have necessitated these sacrifices on the part of
the MARQUIs OF HASTINGs are estimated by “ARGUs” at about
£50,000, to meet which the Marquis was prepared to raise £20,000—a
sum whereof one-half would make a philosopher (without wife and
gº happy...That noble lord the MARQUIs of HASTINGs, you see,
Sir, has lost all his property, apparently, if not more besides, in bets
made upon that noble animal, the horse. A noble animal it is, truly;
chivalry and the equestrian order derive their very names from it; yet
in these days, anyhow, it is one thing to be chivalrous and another to
be horsey. Regarded as an animal magnet, the horse does not appear
to emit exactly a noble animal magnetism—does it? On the contrary,
it attracts blackguards about it in far greater numbers than gentlemen,
and it is apt to exert a very demoralising influence even on gentle-
men; stultifying most of those whom it does not demoralise. Under
the influence of that noble animal men win money like rogues, or lose
it like fools., But what I want to call your attention to is the evidently
magnetic nature of this influence.
In the first place, Sir, consider the polarity of the horsey influence,
The roguery on the one hand, and the folly on the other, in which it
becomes visible, curiously correspond to the north and south poles of
terrestrial or ferro-magnetism, or to Fº and negative electricity.
In the next, think of the property, which horses, thus apparently pos-
sess, of imparting the aptitude to cheat or to be cheated. Is there not
something in this similar, at least, to magnetic and electric induction?
The horse appears to affect the majority of those about it either with
positive dishonesty, or with a negation of intellect. In the latter case,
that is to say, when its magnetic induction is an inducement to lose
money, may not that noble animal the horse be said to induce upon a
man the condition and quality of that ignoble animal the donkey P
Strange that the horse should make asses of men; but so it does.
In the particular, case to which this communication refers, let us
rejoice, Mr. Punch, that the negative effect of horsey animal magnetism
was the only one induced. Let us hope that it was transient, and no
longer exists.
Allow me to conclude with a remark on a few peculiar words in the
foregoing quotation. I wonder how many sporting gents would like
to bet that they could correctly recite the statement of “ARGus” that
the MARQUIs of HASTINGs had disposed of his Hunters, his Hounds,
and his Hacks. Horsey magnetic influence does not seem always to
confer the ability to pronounce the word “horse” aright, or to talk
horse with any utterance of that word's initial letter, unless where it
Qught not to be sounded. Of the betting men congregated at Epsom,
for instance, a no small proportion, perhaps, would tell you that they
don’t believe in 'Ossy Hanimal Magnetism. They demonstrate, how-
ever, what they mean to deny to PARACELSUs MINOR.
P.S. Horse-shoes are still mailed to doors by bumpkins for a defence
against witchcraft. The most usual form of magnetised iron or steel
is that of the horse-shoe magnet. These are facts—valeant quantum.

[May 30, 1868.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 18th. The Education Bill was scratched. No great
loss, for it was a three-legged brute, and very weak. “All MR. GLAD-
stone's fault that the scratching had to be done,” said the DUKE of
MARLBoRough, plaintively. Which, in a sense it is, no doubt, as if
he had not brought out the Irish horse, the Government screws might
have had a chance. Excuse racing slang on the Derby Day. . .
Next came the Regulation of Railways Bill. One good thing was
stuck into it. The nuisance of a smoky chimney, reeking before you
for hours, and filling the carriages with sulphureous odours, ought to
be abated. The Companies lay the fault on the engine-drivers, and the
engine-drivers on the Companies. The Bill imposes a heavyish penalty
on both. Something should have been said of the cheek of a Company
that inflicts huge volumes of foul smoke on a passenger, and fines him
for lighting a ten-penny cigar.
About three years ago a fellow called O'LEARY was sent to gaol in
Ireland, and to the usual question, “What’s your religion ?” impu-
dently replied, “that he had none, and that he called himself Pagan”
O'LEARY”. Whereat the Governor, a military man, ordered him to
have a religion immediately. He refused, and was put on penal diet,
and this process was repeated until he declared himself a Roman
Catholic. This being precisely the plan which Roman Catholics,
where they have power, adopt for the purpose of making conversions,
they can say nothing against it, but MR. PETER TAYLOR, the Leicester
grievance-monger, brought the matter before the House, which roared
a good deal during LoRD MAYo's explanation. Of course, a con-
scientious atheist is entitled to all consideration and commiseration,
but as this O'LEARY merely meant to be insolent and defiant, we do
not know that any particular harm was done. When Coler IDGE, at
school, avowed himself a republican, his master flogged him, “wisely,
as I think, soundly, as I know.”
We referred the Boundaries Bill to a Committee of Five, chosen by
MR. Disraeli, who selected a majority of Liberals., Actually, none
of the Opposition attacked him for this, or accused him of hypocrisy
or trickery.
Then we prepared to go into Committee on the Scottish Reform Bill.
It was proposed to give seven additional Members to Caledonia (stern
and wild), and thereby to raise the numbers of the House of Commons.
M R. Baxter asked, instead, that all English boroughs with fewer than
5000 intabitants should be disfranchised, and the Scotch Members
obtained in that way. SIR RAINAld KNIGHTLEY, an old Tory, preferred
that places having two Members, and ſewer than 12,000 people, should
lose one seat. The PREMIER found that he must give way, so he sup-
ported the second proposition, but the House carried the first, and
Government was again defeated; numbers 217 to 196, majority 21.
The Scotchinen thus pulled a piece out of the English Reform Act,
and obtained their demands at English expense. We suppose it is
revenge for Flodden, but they must not carry their vengeance too far,
or English indignation will carry an Act forbidding a Scotchman to
quote BURNs more than six times in any one speech or article.
We went into Committee, and the irrepressible Scotch, led by MR.
Bouv ERIE, an Englishman, wopped the Government again, by 118 to
96. The clause enacting a Rºle;paying qualification was knocked out.
MR. DiskAELI then cried “halt,” as this was an important
alteration.
There was remonstrance, when out spoke SIR CHARLes Russell, of
the Victoria Cross, and advised the PREMIER to appeal to the country
against his antagonists. The nation understood the situation, added
Sir CHARLEs, and that the business was merely a struggle for power
between two men of eloquence and ability.
MR. DIs RAEli took until Thursday to consider.
It is couveulent to add here, that having considered, he announced that
this Amendment had been arrived at precipitately, and that he should
give the House an opportunity for reconsideration. He should on the
following Monday move that no one should vote in Scotland who had
not been Rated, and paid his Rates.
Another scene of abuse was added to the Cabinet Drama. A few of
the epigrams may amuse theatrical readers.
Hon. Percy Wyndham (a Conservatioe). Government pull out what
they call their principles, as a showman draws his puppets from a bag,
to be dangled awhile, and put away when they have served their turn.
Some of us refuse to be dragged through the mud.
John Bright (a Quaker). The Minister ought not to menace us. A
crisis twice a week is rather too much for my nerves. If he picks a
quarrel now, it is for love of the quarrel.
Mr. Bouverie (a H/hig). The Minister is like Ancient Pistol, also
Mr. Tools. I could wish my enemy nothing more humiliating than his
position.
Mr. J. Hardy (brother of Mr. G. Hardy). If MR. Bouver IE likes to
go into the country, nobody will regret it. Why give the narrow-
minded Scotch more Members ? I won’t say with CHARLEs THE
SEcos D. that Presbyterianism is not a religion for a gentleman; but it
is not colservative, and bands with Papists.
Sir R. Knightley (the old Tory). I only want the two other Reform
Bills passed; then turn the Ministry out next day, if you like. -
Sir George Bowyer (Catholic). The language used is the true humi-
liation. If Ministers desire to keep office, their opponents are hungry
§: place. He had heard no Ministerial menace, which would, indeed,
e a crime.
Col. Loyd Lindsay (Conservative Son-in-Law of Lord Overstone). Mean
and paltry motives ought not to be attributed to the Ministerialists;
and, as for MR. WYNDHAM, let him remember ADDIson on SIR. Rogeh
De Cove Riry's hounds. An old one is listened to, but a raw dog may
yelp his heart out.
[Of course, they met at Chalk Farm in the morning, when MR. Wynn HAM's ball
took effect in Primrose Hill, and MR. Li ND3AY's somewhere in the Adelaide Road,
after which they shook hands )
Mr. G. Hardy (Home Secretary). I say nothing in the way of retalia-
tion for offensive remarks, but why don't, the Opposition try to put an
end to an exhibition which they say is a disgrace? For that proceeding
I long. I defy you. Make a distinct motion.
Mr. Bernal Osborne (“a nondescript country gentleman"). Baiting a
Minister is delightful, but it may be carried too far. Let us pass the
Bills. Representative institutions are getting rather to a discount.
Mr. Moncrieff (late Liberal Advocate). It is not right to throw
Government crises into Scotch faces.
Then that matter was left until the Monday.
L ºw. The important Friendly Societies Bill was scratched in the
ords.
MR. GLADstone demanded the intentions of MR. DisrAELI as to the
Suspensory Act.
R. DisrAELI. As it is the first step towards the disestablishment
of the Church, I intend to give it all possible opposition. -
The whole sitting was given to a debate on the Purchase System in
the Army. It was originated by MR. TREvely AN, who would abolish
the system and buy up the vested interests, a process which GENERAL
Peel, estimated would cost between ten and twelve millions. The
discussion was too technical to be interesting, but the subject itself
demands attention. The middle classes complain that they are nothing
in the Army, which is composed only of the highest and lowest.
Wednesday. The day sitting was given to SIR Colm AN O'Loghlen's
Libel Bill, the object of which is to make the speakers of libels respon-
sible for them instead of the newspaper which merely records them.
It is a small and reasonable relief, yet it was opposed; but when we
say that among the opponents was MR. WHALLEy, we need scarcely
add that the measure commends itself to every sensible man. It made
progress.
Thursday. In addition to the Reform epigrams above, we made some
progress with the Bribery Bill, which Mr. MILL declared to be, though
incomplete, very creditable to the Government, as a bold attempt to
grapple with a great evil. A Bill for the “comprehending all vagrom
men’’ went through Committee, and a Member feared that it would
punish two of the Commons who might toss for a cab, and also would
interfere with games at marbles and buttons. Was not the elephantine
trunk illustrated P
Friday. MR. DENIs Joseph REARDoN signalised himself in the
House of Commons by asking, or rather by trying to ask, whether, as
the QUEEN has gone to Scotland, Ministers did not intend, for her
own comfort, and the good of the Nation, to advise HER MAJESTY to
Abdicate | . From all sides of the House descended a storm of indig-
nation, which the SPEAKER crystallised into an intimation that such a
question must not be put. The case is not one for the use of hard
language about poor MR. REARDoN, whose own Abdication is desirable.
CAPTAIN ARCH DALL put into a Question Mr. Punch's suggestion last
week, that Negromania might induce a prosecution of SiR Robert

EYRE. Two military gentlemen also adverted to the subject; but on
the whole, we think their advocacy of MR. EYRE had better be con-
fined to an imitation, according to their means, of Lord OVERstone,
the typical dispassionate man, who has come forward with a subscrip-
tion of £200 to the Eyre Defence Fund, and a dignified intimation that
the pecuniary ruin of that brave and good officer “can never be

BosN AT EDINBURGH, SEPTEMBER 19, 1778.
DIED AT CANNEs, MAY 7, 1868.
A GRAND old tree has fallen' Can it be,
That with so little stir it has come down
That in the forest scarce a gap we see
For loss of that great trunk and reverend crown?
Gaunt, º with vice-like roots and gnarled knees,
A green leaf here and there on some tough limb,
That once had growth and girth for many trees,
He stood : no passer-by but noted him,
Wond'ring to gauge his wreck, and learn his age,
And hear how broad was once the shade he cast;
With what defiant port he faced the rage
Of storms, when weaker growths gave to the blast.
He lived and lived . . . from hot youth to hoar eld,
From flush of leaf to bareness of green bough :
A giant in decay, that still up-held
A shrunken strength, and weight of furrowed brow.
Lntil at last we heard he was laid low;
Not by the stroke of storm or levin sped,
In still Provençal night, and May moon’s glow,
When none was by, he bowed his ancient head.
The peaceful death to close the restless life,
The quiet eve to crown the stormy day !
Such should be the surcease from noble strife,
So should a well-spent being ebb away.
As he lies thus, . . . ere earth to earth is given,
We trace back his long life, and find it knit
With all wherein our century has striven, -
Stirred, spoken, reared, o'erthrown, fought, wrought, or writ.
The ninety-year-old man was part of all,
Great part of most that’s worthiest and best:
Through that long race the oar he scarce let fall,
Scarce through that long day's work paused once to rest.
It was a time of tempest and of toil,
An age of battle with all forms of ill,
Ill that brought strength to crush, and fraud to foil,
Delay to sicken, and contempt to chill.
Bias of honour, place, wealth, worldly good,
Drew all away; he would not so be drawn.
Truth and Right's soldier from the first he stood,
And in the thickest darkness looked for dawn.
Count all the triumphs in these fifty years
By Right and Truth o'er Wrong and Falsehood won;
Of the Good Cause's Paladins and Peers,
A faithfuller than HENRY BROUGHAM is none.
He lived through all those fights, and seemed to grow
Tenser and tougher with their wear and tear;
And when the strife was done, and the sun low,
And “age brought honour and the silver hair,”
He could look o'er his life, and say, at last,-
“No cause for which I fought now counts a foe:
No goal I made for but is reached and past;
No ill I aimed a blow at but lies low.”
A fighter born, with fighter's work in hand,
He had the fighter's weak points with the strong;
Hot, vehement to rashness, never bland,
In hates, as loves, too sudden oft and wrong ;
Wain, quick of temper, proud of all he knew,
As who, that knew so much, but might be proud,
By all he had done, and all he hoped to do–
Lifted, his great head's height, above the crowd P
Why note what flaws may be in such a fame P:
Freer of flaws than his the fames are few ;
Sum up the gains to which he linked his name;—
What nobler work did ever statesman do?
The senate purged; charity's stream strained pure;
Slaves freed; chicane and bigotry put down;
Knowledge on ignorance gaining, slow but sure;
This was his life's work, is his memory's crown!
COMFORT FOR CAMPAIGNERS.
MR. PUN
CH, -
I AM, an old Soldier, Sir, and I must protest against the milk
and water tenderness which, in my belief, is ruining the Army. Only
look at this, Sir. I quote it from the Lancet, which is pleased to make
some comments on our infantry equipment:—
“The equipment, as now perfected, is extremely simple; so much so, indeed,
that it seems wonderful it was not sooner adopted. The old framed knapsack is
entirely discarded, and a soft valise is substituted. The weights are distributed
round the body, and are brought low down, with a view of gaining the great me-
chanical advantage of keeping the centre of gravity of the body as near as can be in
the position in which it is ºn the unweighted person, and of allowing free action of
the chest and of the great muscles of the shoulders. The sacrum and the tops of
the scapulae, which are the two strongest parts of the body, bear the chief weights ;
and advantage is taken of the principle of balance. The equipment is most easily
adjusted, and is put on and off in a unoment."
.These “improvements,” as some call them, are all owing to the
hints of a War Office Committee, appointed to investigate the health
of the Army, and ascertain how far the ancient knapsack was affecting
it. I suppose that pipeclay will shortly be discarded, lest soldiers get
sore throats from wearing a damp crossbelt. Perhaps ere long the
troops will all be stethescoped before they are allowed to undertake a
march, and if they get their feet wet they will not be allowed to go to
bed without warm bottles. “Tallow your noses” will be the final
bugle call at night, and, for fear of the raw atmosphere, no soldier will
be suffered to appear upon parade before ten in the morning.
Sir, in my belief the service is going to the dogs, and our abolishing
the Cat is but a further proof of it. It sickens me to think that there
should be such care to keep our Army in good health, and I am
horrified to find that it is actually thought proper now to make our
soldiers comfortable. Clumsy knapsacks, Sir, were worn when Waterloo
was won, and it is my belief, Sir, men only grow effeminate by being
molly-coddled. Yours, in indignation,
ONE of THE OLD ScHool.
POISONOUS PLANTS.
MEssRs. BAYLEY and RAwsTHoRNE, of the Patent Wheel Works,
42, Newington Causeway, in a letter to the Times, headed “The
Lambeth Smoke Nuisance,” attest the praiseworthy activity of MR.
SANDison, the Government inspector. They state that on the previous
day they were fined at the Southwark Police Court for “unlawfully
using a furnace not constructed so as to consume its own smoke.” Of
this mulct they say:—
“We do not complain. We have a burning desire to consume our own smoke.”
Very well said. They have no right to complain. Their burning
desire to consume their own smoke is commendable as far as it goes;
but a burning desire, how hot soever, has not the heat that will con-
sume smoke. What they want is a ſurnace which will burn the smoke
up. This, indeed, they go on to urge, sensibly enough. But they
remark:—
“We submit that, if the Government insist on all manufacturers using a smoke-
consuming apparatus to their satisfaction, they should be prepared to adopt what
they consider the best invention, and fine all manufacturers who do not use it.”
Nay, gentlemen manufacturers all and sundry, the Government does
its part, and has enough to do, in taking care that you shall not defile
your neighbourhood with soot, and poison the atmosphere. It is for
you to discover how not to establish nuisances, whether works which,
in towns, offend the eyes and the nose, or, in the country, plants that
sear and blacken all surrounding vegetation. You must live by your
plants and works, must you? There is no necessity for that ; and
your right to live must be conditional on your managing to let live,
and so not killing herbage and trees, nor stifling people to death.
Common Cause in the County Court.
SUBJoſNED is the conclusion, according to the Globe, of a County
Court case, wherein, TITIENs was sued by a perruquier to recover
; 17s. for a wig which she had ordered to wear as Marguerite in
aust:-
“MLLE. Takrºse TITIENs, defendant, said the wig produced was not of the
colour she had selected; it did not fit her, and was not the natural hair she had
stipulated for, and therefore she declined to pay for it. The jury found a verdict
for the plaintiff."
Qf course. At this time for betting it would be as safe as seasonable
to lay any wager that the jury was composed of small shopkeepers.
AN OLD QUOTATION WITH A NEW APPLICATION.
Those who think that the proceedings against PRESIDENT Johnson
are not over wise, will be glad to see that so far, the American Senate
is not disposed to “own the soft impeachment.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DR. JOHNSON AT THE DERBY.
(Hitherto unpublished in Boswell.)
1780. AGE 71.]
The next day I carried my revered friend to the Epsom Races, at
which a new Prize was to be contended for, the struggle being called
the Derby. I took care to drive thither early, so that DR. Johnson
might escape the ribaldries of the lower sort; and I also took pains to
obtain a good place for our vehicle, which was drawn up between two
garriages of persons of quality, as appeared by the heraldic insignia.
Pointing this out to him, he was not pleased, and said, “Sir, you are
a fool. That my carriage should be in juxtaposition with dukes, con-
fers upon me neither personal dignity nor the right to address them.
We came hither for pleasure, and I had rather have been brought nearer
to those agreeable ladies.” I proposed to move. “Nay, Sir,” he said,
“that were greater folly than t’other.” Perceiving me dashed, he
added, with his accustomed kindness, “Never mind, Sir, we do not
expect wisdom or knowledge of the world from a Scotchman.” The
usual fry of gipsies, mendicants, and miserable instrumentalists
gathered round us, and I ordered them away with more severity in my
voice than was needful; but I was anxious that he should not be dis-
turbed. “Tut, let the creatures, alone,” he said; “they exist, and
therefore it is for us to tolerate them. They were created for some
purpose or other.” I ventured to urge that it was not his ordinary
custom to favour the worthless. He replied, rolling his head, and
laughing loudly. “I favour You, Sir.” It was impossible to be
offended, so prompt was my revered friend's wit. But he would
allow me to be assaulted by no one else, for on one of our companions,
a gentleman of merit, saying, “You have handicapped Bozzy, Sir,” he
replied, “Sir, although in the open air I stickle not for the rule of
the saloon, I admire neither the cant of the ſº nor the fami-
liarity of the clown.” So jealously he watched over the interests of
those whom he loved. I ordered the servants to produce refreshments
of which I had provided a good store, and he was pleased to say that f
had catered well; yet his humorous nature and vast power of illus-
tration immediately hurried him into satire. “What would one of
your hungry Scotch ancestors say, Sir, could he see you devouring a
pie of France, and washing it down with a wine of Germany fº I said
that I hoped my ancestors had better food in Elysium, but he instantly
rebuked my levity, and bade me not talk like a heathem. Then, his
good nature prompted him to add, “But you are a small poet in your
small way, Sir, and we must permit licence to such folk.” l repre-
sented that Day DEN had written of Elysium. “Nay,” he said; “iſ
you liken yourself to DRyden, I have done with you.” I thought he
did me injustice, but I would not say so, and turned the conversation
with a harmless but natural remark upon the greatness of the crowd,
and the thought that, in a hundred years, all those persons would be
dead. “I think, Sir,” said my venerable friend, “that you are one of
the greatest asses in the world. Whether these persons are on Epsom
Downs, or scattered at their ordinary avocations, they will equally be
dead in a hundred years. Why these trite moralities P” He then did
me the honour to bid me fill his glass, and hummed aloud gaily his
own immortal line—
“Come, my lad, and drink some beer.”
A kind of lottery being proposed by one of my companions, DR. JoHN-
SON said, “With all my heart, you gambling dogs, l’ll have a frisk
with you;” and he allowed me to pay his half-crown for him, and
seemed pleased when told that a favourite animal had been allotted to
him by fortune, quoting from I know not what Greek writer, to the
effect that “fate had thrown for him the Treble Six.” I did not at
first see the entire felicitousness of this; but when I discovered that
my revered friend's horse was Number 18, which I need scarcely
remark is the treble of six, tears of admiration came into my eyes.
“You are so dreadfully ignorant and slow,” he said, when I explained
the cause of my emotion, “that a small thing produces an undue effect
on you.” Thus did the great DR. Johnson undervalue his vast
merits. The bell then resounded for clearing the course, and he was
pleased at seeing the ease with which a few constables divided that
mob, and ranged it in order. “Were this Scotland, Sir,” he said,
“we should have had every Sawney wrangling and arguing with the
constables, and thus defeating his own pleasure; but we are a civilised
nation.”. I said, “that perhaps we Scots carried our pertinacity too
far, but that it had helped us to civil and religious freedom.” “There
is neither a civil nor a religious man in Scotland,” roared my venerable
friend,”, adding playfully, “now that you are in England.”. But I
refused to accept this compliment at the expense of my nation, and
told him so, when he instantly answered, “Don’t be afraid of your
nation going to any expense.” I pressed the subject, and he told me
that I had better hold my tongue or else get out of the carriage—
“Manet sors tertia, cardi,” he added, holding up his large fist in merri-
ment. The first Derby race then took place, which was gained by a
horse named Diomed, and it will cause no surprise that DR. Johnson's
wonderful memory instantly served him with a happy quotation from
WIRGIL–
“Widimus, O cives, Diomede Argivaque castra.”
which is peculiarly applicable, when we reflect that the dishonest
persons who attend races are called Greeks. He pronounced the
words with his accustomed sonorous voice, which attracted the atten-
tion of some young ladies in a neighbouring carriage, and one of them,
with scarcely excusable familiarity, asked him whether he was talkin
Dutch. “No, you pretty little idiot,” he replied, with perfect good-
humour, “as you might know, evidently coming from the Low
Countries.” Then, thinking that he might have hurt her feelings, he
desired me to get out of the carriage, and convey to her a glass of wine to
drink his health, which she did with much gratification when I informed
her, in a whisper, of the name of the great man who had thus honoured
her. Returning to my place in the carriage, I ventured to joke, and
to say that I had played the part of Cupid, at which my revered friend
was good enough to laugh heartily. He had º drawn the second
horse, and thus saved his stake, but when I claimed the coin, as having
aid for him, he pocketed it defiantly, saying, “No, no, Sir, he who
eads his friend into gambling deserves to incur a penalty.” Thus did
my venerable acquaintance omit no opportunity of fixing a moral in
my memory. The wine, and the excitement of the day, and the
honour of being abroad with DR. Johnson, combined to liberate my
fancy, and I said that I wished our #. could be painted for
posterity. “No, Sir,” he said, almost sternly, “I desire not to be
remembered by my acts of recreation, nor,” he added, slily, “by my
companionship with you. Let’s have no more of that.” Yet I flatter
myself with the hope that nomen erit indebile nostrum, and that in
virtue of my friendship with my revered companion, I may find a place
on Academical canvass in years to come. The thought enabled me to
bear his raillery, but it made me pensive, which Dr. Johnson observ-
ing, cheered me up by kindly asking why I hung down my head like a
booby, and pointing out to me, with his accustomed exactitude, that a
man should be either sober or drunk. Acting upon this hint, I
proposed a series of toasts, among which the clarum et venerabile
nomen of my illustrious friend was foremost, and I have not a very
distinct recollection of our return to London. But in our next inter-
view he reproved me severely and deservedly for this lapse from virtue,
concluding by saying: “And, Sir, remember that to the sufferings of
those who had lost their money at the Derby, you added a new pang
by the intolerable howling with which, under the pretence of melody,
you made night hideous on our return journey.” May the lesson of
the illustrious sage be useful, not only to me, but to all other spectators
of the Derby
THE REWOLT LEAGUE AGAINST EYBE.
YE savages thirsting for bloodshed and plunder,
Ye miscreants burning for rapine and prey,
By the fear of the lash and the gallows kept under,
Henceforth who shall venture to stand in your way?
Run riot, destroy, ravage, kill without pity,
Let any man how he molests you beware,
Beholding how hard the Jamaica Committee
To ruin are trying to hunt gallant EYRE.
Our mob-leaders suffered, in fancy, with others,
Of stamped-out rebellion who felt the strong heel,
They are touched by the hemp that chastised their black brothers,
And their feelings are hurt by the lead and the steel.
A set ever ranged on the side of sedition,
To mutinous negroes, now, hands they extend,
And, now, with their names back a Fenian petition—
The foe of the Ruler is always their Friend.
They are doing their worst to make certain that, never
Again, shall rebellion encounter a check;
That the chief who to crush a revolt may endeavour,
Shall his duty perform with a rope round his neck.
Conspiring against one, from maddened brutes' fury
Who saved Englishwomen, and Englishmen’s lives
Their fangs may they gnash while they curse a Grand Jury
Of Britons who value their daughters and wives.
Rather Type-Confounding.
A PAPER was recently read at a meeting of one of the Scientific
Societies, with the apparently cruel Title—“Elasticity of Animal
Type.” As this requires explanation, perhaps some intelligent com-
positor will have the kindness to say what sort of type this is; and
whether it can be used without inflicting much suffering, which would
be distressing to the workmen to cause and witness, printers being
usually most humane men. It occurs to us that the only type which
can possibly be considered animal is—Bourgeois.

AT length, MR. PETER TAYLoR (with the aid of a Black or two, and
a sailor, who was so overpowered by remorse, or rum, that he was as
hard to bind over as the tipsy priest found the child was to baptise)
has obtained the Committal of MR. EYRE. A man whose name was dear
to the Australians for his gallantry as an Explorer, and for his humanity
to the natives, an officer who saved Jamaican society, White and
Black, by his promptness and resolution, is to stand in the dock, and
answer for that crime against some of the most brutal savages, in
creation. At last, MR. EYRE himself expressed his feelings, and his
words deserve all publicity:—
“Not upon me, but upon those who have brought me here, will fall the disgrace,
that a man who has served his country faithfully for twenty-six years, and for
twenty years in positions of high responsibility, is now, after two years and a half of
unceasing and most rancorous persecution, about to be committed to a felon's dock
for having discharged his duty faithfully to the best of his ability, and irrespective
of personal considerations, saving indubitably a great British colony from ruin, and
the people from massacre, or worse than massacre. I do not envy the feelings of
those who, conspiring to ruin a public officer, now at last succeed in bringing
this additional stigma upon him, but I do rejoice in believing that they form a
very small section of the community. I have the confident belief that neither these
views nor the magistrate's decision will influence or be accepted by the higher
tribunal to which the case will now be preferred, or by the large majority of my
fellow-countrymen, to whose common sense and sense of justice I confidently
entrust my honour as a gentleman and my character as a public officer."
The Court *g.” plaudits, which could with difficulty be checked;
and, that the Echo may be prolonged, we republish the speech.
It reminds us of the story of WARREN HASTINGs, the victim of the
hate of far greater men than those who persecute EYRE. He, too,
underwent a long martyrdom at the hands of his enemies, and was
ruined. But he lived to be received with acclamations by the House
of Commonº, who rose and, uncovered to receive him, and to be
thanked by the representative of the Crown for having saved British
dominion. Englishmen listen too much to noisy ºf gushing men,

A HOMOEOPATHIC HOME.
The following advertisement, extracted from a daily
. speaks for itself, and sufficiently well bespeaks its
author:-
OMOEOPATHY.—Paris-A Physician can RECEIVE an
INMAte, with or without medical care. Being graduate ºf Ox-
ford and Paris, and late gouverneur of a prince, could efficiently direct
; studies : a pupil. Terms from £300, or per month. Address,
r. , &c.
This “Physician,” who “can, receive an inmate with
or without medical care,” and “being graduate ºf Oxford
and late gouverneur of a prince, could efficiently direct the
studies of a pupil,” is evidently a man of education, and
thereby particularly qualified to be a tutor. He writes
remarkable English. The heading of his announcement,
“Homoeopathy,” is by no means to be taken to mean
Humbug. His proposal of “Terms from £200, or per
month,” cannot but be regarded as a very moderate offer
to take anyone in.
but recover themselves in time, and make ample amends. But in MR.
YRE's case, Society has long given its verdict, and a Grand Jury
will, we hope, ji, confirm it.
SPIRIT HANDS WANTED.
For those who like strange puzzles, here is one we find in a dra.
matic newspaper. For absolute inexplicability (a nice word that for
an after-dinner speaker) it beats all to nothing what Prime Ministers
will say when they mean to be mysterious:-
WANº. to join immediately, a GOOD LEADING CORNET
PLAYER: also to play First Wiolin Inside. -
It may seem a little strange that somebody should want to hire a
player on the cornet to play the violin; but how very much nº
curious is the demand that he will play the latter instrument “inside".
How on earth can anybody play a violin inside?... A spirit hand might
do it, but where are we just now to find a spirit hand MB. Holſº
has left off playing “Home, Sweet Home!” on the accordion. Since he
got into Chancery his spirits have quite left him: most men find their
spirits leave them when they get into that court. Since they were
nearly smashed at Liverpool, the DAVENPORTs disclaim connection wit
the spirits. So we really quite despair of learning how to play a tune
inside a fiddle; although we feel convinced that: nobody, without a
spirit hand to help him could possibly perform so curious a feat.

CHAPTER XXV.
PENDENTE. LITE.
She shut her lover into the Lighthouse and returned. -
This proceeding had been watched by PIEL DoRNTON by the aid of
his powerful telescope.
“She must be mine,” he exclaimed. The prospect of the baronetcy
and the millions had entirely absorbed him.
But the papers. How to obtain them?
Joseph would not part with them, and without them—stay! The
girl’s claim existed—that was a fact, at all events. One set of papers
attesting the fact was as good as another.
Old MARTIN was dead, at least so he believed, and for the first time
he regretted an act which had deprived him of the only person capable
of giving him any information. -
“Just like me,” he said to himself, remorsefully. “Always choking,
or shooting somebody. I must give it up.”
Ah, PIEL DoRNton, would you could even then have acted upon
this call of conscience. But he stifled it.
“The Girl!” he said, suddenly. “Bess can tell me.”
He ran to the cottage.
She was gone.
He searched the house. Old MARTIN was gone: not a trace of him.
“I must have shot him, thoroughly,” he muttered to himself,
“Blown him quite away!”
He was silent for one second: then he fired of a pistol.
Roused by this, he saw, but one course before him. .
“She has gone to the lighthouse,” he thought, “to join him. I can
produce papers as good as theirs, ha! hal" and he laughed fiendishly
at the recollection of the documents to which CHEKK. Diss, Count
& Co. had given their respectable attestation.

[Didn't he “catch it / "
'Twas all clear now. -
“I can succeed without them,” he said, and waved his hat in
triumph.
From the shelf he took a box of matches, which would only ignite
when you didn't want them, or on other solemn occasions, and he
proceeded by the secret pass among the rocks to where his small canoe
was always kept, ready, if need were, for instantaneous escape.
Seizing the paddle, which in this boat, being his own property, he
always worked himself, he glided noiselessly towards the lighthouse.
A voice from an upper window asked, “Is that you BEss?”
al was Joseph's, and came as a revelation to him. She was not
ere.
“Will you give me those papers?” he asked, pitching his voice as
high as it could go. 'Twas not like Elizabeth's; Love knew the
difference.
“Go away !” exclaimed Joseph, with real aversion. “I have
nothing for you.” - -
“Then perish,” exclaimed DoRNToN, savagely, and applied a lighted
match to the base of the Lighthouse.
Creeping, curling, slowly, certainly, upward the flame took its way.
In and out of the brickwork, round the stones, through the wainscot
crept the cruel unerring fire.
Joseph instinctively dreaded something, but he only felt a sudden
warmth, for which he was unable to account.
PIEL DoRNTon returned to the shore, and landing opposite Phle-
bosco Palace, summoned his dential servant.
“Is your mistress within "he asked.
“LADY ANNA is asleep, your Reverence,” was the reply.
“”Tis well,” he returned. “Loose the bloodhound.”
The confidential servant did so.

“My Lord,” exclaimed the wretched man, “I cannot.”
“Obey my behest,” thundered his master, “Or by heaven”—
The man staggered back. The ball had entered his head.

It was a thoughtless act, and one of which even he, in his calmer
moments would not have been guilty. - -
Aroused by the noise, the LADY ANNA stood behind him.
“PIEL!'” she said, tenderly. 4. -
“I cannot stop now,” was his rough answer. 2 I am going out
hunting. Don't whine—don't mope—go to—bed.’
She looked at him searchingly. So changed He who owed so
much to her, which only they two knew. -
But she feared to rupture the one silken cord still between them, and
turning on her heel waltzed into the house.
Once within, she opened a secret door, and out stepped the Infant-
watcher.
“You say you are devoted to me,” she said to the Infant, who bowed.
“I believe you; follow him, and let me know the result.” The Infant
stole out upon the track. -
“She is treacherous !” said Piel DoRNton, as he stood alone in the
court-yard. “She cannot deceive me with these gay steps I must
be free of her.” So saying, he unmuzzled the hound, and mounting
upon his spotted steed, followed in the track.
Till he came up with Bess: for the Hound was sure and safe, and
held her till he arrived, when he enticed him away and secured the girl.
“I am thy lower,” he hissed in her ear., “I love you, madly.”.
The word made her tremble."She felt the force of this description of
his wild and lawless passion. - - -

MY first remark is,
“Hooray "my se-

“That I wish you all
many happy returns of

all your good healths.”
And now to business,
which should always
be postponed to plea-

takes a clever man to
enjoy himself. It is a
pleasure to me to ad-
dress this annual pro-
phecy to my affection-
ate readers and noble
patrons; they are all
so blessed clever, and
understand a fellow's least hint and wink as well as if he expatiated like ten
DIsraelis rolled into fifteen GLADstones. Talking of that, Do you know what
an expatiator is? Well, in Lancashire he's a fellow who stands on a bank and
sees a man sinking, and says, “That poor chap 'll be drownded; what a pity there's
nobody here to take hold of this here rope and pitch it to him.” There's a lot of
that sort in other places than Lancashire, my esteemed swells; mind that, when
you might help a cove, but modestly content yourselves with pitying of him.
Where was I? This Derby makes me Dizzy, when I ought to be Hardy, but mind
my Manners notwithstanding, Hunt up defaulters, and pay whatever I May Owe.
Twig them Ministerial puns? Bless you, I could make twice as many in half the
time, and think no more about it than if I'd swollered an Irish Church. But touch-
ing and concerning these horses. The horse is a noble beast, that must be allowed,
and perhaps it is the very excess of his nobility that makes most bipeds who aspire
to be intimate with him so uncommon ignoble; but that’s neither here northere.
He is a distinguished member of the family of Equidae, is a herbivorous party, but
will devour Christians, vide the case of Dioxiedes, also will eat up gold
and estates very rapidly, vide a variety of handsome young noblemen and
gentlemen, on whom you may look around from the height of your drag. Now I have
assembled here to see this 89th Derby run, and you demand of me which horse will
win the same. I reply to you, with the same frankness, that I don't know. But you
little know your prophet if you think that he is to be deterred by “a trifle like that"
(for we all love a pretty girl under the rose) from stating in the most positive, Macau

The sky was illumined with a fearful glow. He gave her his glass,
and through it she saw the Lighthouse in flames: in flames which were
chasing a running frightened figure with papers in its hands up the
iron stairs.
The entire lower part of the Lighthouse was consumed, not one
brick or stone or stick left to tell its fearful tale. Only the upper part
remained, which was fast becoming enveloped in the arms of the
raging devouring element. The glass was the old powerful one of
PIEL's, and brought the object so near that she stopped her ears, lest
the º creature's cries should pierce them. Then as the flames
reached the last point, the very top of the Lighthouse, all beneath
having fallen and crumbled entirely away, they saw the form of a man
tying some papers to his belt, and as the trembling support gave
beneath, his feet, they saw him, distinctly, with one tremendous leap,
plunge, headforemost, into the dark and angry sea below.

most difficult word which a young lady can give you to make out of separate letters,

saying more on the subject. This is Blue Gown. Edie Ochiltree was a blue gown and
a beggar. This animal is a beggar to run, but when called on to mend his pace, may

sternation, at least a constellation, and it is called Orton. That heathen, as you may
all forget, came to grief at the hands of Diana, to whom he proffered attentions of an
unacceptable character; and though he ran like mad when the lady fitted her
arrow to her bow, she brought him down whack. Let him run to-day as he ran
then, and I will ask MR. HoRNE to write another Farthing Epic about him, and if
he won't, I'll do it myself. Next cometh Pace. He was not called so from his rate,
nor is it Irish for peace, nor a Latin gabblative, but he was named from the respected
Jockey Club steward at Newmarket, and his sire was Caterer. I think it's a case of
monops inter carcos. Here is Paul Jones, so a word in your private-ear. There is, I am
given to understand, a continental coin called a paul, and after putting that limited
amount upon this horse, you can invest the rest of your assets in Jones's locker.
And now place for the lady, the Lady Elizabeth. I take off my hat to that darling,
and if wishes were horses, and beggars could ride, I'm the beggar that
would ride her into glory, and win the Battle of Hastings, though I grudge
the money that would thereby accrue to a lot of greedy ring men. For Le Sarazin,

would be if after-dinner speeches could be made by some

plan, by which to get a speech made, without the bore of
making it? Everyone knows everything that anyone can
say, when called on for a speech; and if nobody were to
make one, surely nobody would suffer. By the side, say,
of the chairman, a wax figure might be placed, modelled
to resemble him in features and in figure. This dummy
might, by clockwork, get upon its legs, when wound up
by the toast-master, and might be made to mumble what
might pass for a good sample of after-dinner º: To
carry out, this notion with suitable effect, each famous
dinner, talker should go about provided with a model of
himself, supplied with tubes and tones to imitate his own
peculiar voice. Perhaps after awhile the presence of a
speaker might entirely be dispensed with, and his effigy
one be invited to attend. hen this is happily the
fashion, what rejoicing there will be among our martyred
public diners, and what a ºffinº digestion and of
temper will be spared them e i recommend our
notion to the Humane Society, whose duty clearly is to
rescue Pºiº orators from floundering about in a perfect

The MissEs MAUD and HESTER HAzy respectfully beg to announce that they
º at Midsummer to extend the sphere of mental cultivation to which they
ave hitherto confined their assiduity, in compliance with the urgent wishes of
many esteemed friends of feminine enlightenment and progress.
The MIsses MAUD and HestER HAzy humbly venture to hope that the grati-
fying, success which has so long attended their labours in a less elevated path
will be deemed a satisfactory assurance of their ability to confer on the young
persons under their tuition the crowning triumphs of a refined jº. education.
Gentlemen of acknowledged parliamentary talent have kindly volunteered their
valuable services, and will conduct the various classes as will be seen on reference
to the subjoined synopsis.
LoRD CLAUDE, FLEUR-DE-LIs, M.P., will attend on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and
Saturdays, from three to five, to ſecure'on Parliamentary Amenities.
Much attention will be given to finesse, and the nice art of misquoting Hansard
with perfect safety, and advantage taken of the brilliant light afforded by recent
achievements.
A class for instructing novices in political º and the mode of
reserving the countenance when “found out,” will be conducted by a most
onourable Member of celebrity in this very difficult department.
Pale blue principles will be superintended by a liberal Professor, Cantab.
Violet ditto by a Conservative B.A., Oxon.
The mode of preparing Estimates and regulating Ways and Means will be
taught by an ex-official perfectly au fait with the pulse of the House, and con-
versant, with its peculiar prejudices in reference to economy.
Paintings, of the most attractive arrangement of colours for “catching the
SPEAKER's eye,” will be furnished to pupils at a trifling expense.
The most approved system of settling small Bills with Government checks, will
be explained by a young gentleman of great Parliamentary promise.
The secret of keeping the Seals will be communicated by a voice from the
Cabinet.
The softer sentiments will be tenderly cherished, and the sweetness of resigna-
tion illustrated by examples drawn from ancient history.
The “Standing Orders”, will be recited daily by a provincial Member,
whose normal impetuosity has been tempered, if not entirely subdued, by the
salutary discipline of being repeatedly coughed down.

neglected, qualified for Office in a few lessons. 1

NOVELS WITHOUT NONSENSE.
Y pear Miss BRowN,-Occupied as you are
daily, like most other young ladies, with
dressing, driving, dining, dancing, flirting,
drumming, and the hundred other labours
of a fashionable life, you can have but little
leisure to devote either to reading, or to
writing, or to thinking, or to any work
which really may exercise your mind. If
you are sentimental, perhaps you keep a
diary, and doubtless write long º:
letters to your dearest bosom friends. But
your reading, I suspect, is confined to the
Church Service, and the last sensation
novel, and you seldom take the pains to
look into a newspaper, unless to see what
at the last drawing-room, or the EMPREss's
last ball. So I have small hope that you
ever read the Quarterly Review, or have
been questioned by your partners as to
what you think of the late article therein upon SIR WALTER Scott,
and whether you consider there is much truth in the following:-
“Doubtless there will be found at most railway stations cheap copies of Scott's
Poems, and of the Waverley Novels, which travellers purchase one by one that they
may read them on the journey as they read any other worthless trash, and then
throw them away. But the instances are rare, we suspect, in which, even among
educated persons, young men or young women under five-and-twenty know any-
thing at all, either of what Scott wrote or of what he did.”
Judging by your conversation when I have had the happiness to
hand you down to dinner, I fear that you are not one of these rara
aves (ask your brother what that means when you next write to him at
Eton; and give him my condolence in his poignant grief at having to
leave school without a “leaving book”). I doubt if you can name
half-a-dozen of Scott's novels, or faithfully describe the plot of any
one of them. Your sister, I believe, is a devourer of French romans,
and may possibly have stumbled on Les Puritains (which is French for
Old Mortality), or scrambled through Evanóay (to use the foreign
accent), or skimmed over the cream of Les Aventures de Nigel, or
sighed over La Prison du Comté d'Edinbourg, as our lively neighbours
call it, although Le Caeur de Midlothian would surely sound as well.
But translations are poor substitutes, even at the best, and I should no
more care to read old RABELA1s in English, than SIR WALTER Scott
in French. I fear, however, you are not so learned as your sister, and
could neither make a list of all, the Tales of my Landlord, nor give the
title of the novel in which Amy Robsart dies. And I thoroughly agree
with the reviewer in the Quarterly, that ignorance of Scott's works is
a thing to be deplored:–
“We look upon this fact.... as a great public misfortune. You cannot find a surer
test of the habits of thought in a people than by taking note of the light literature
which is most in favour with the young of its educated classes. When we find such
great works as Waverley, Guy Mannering, and the Antiquary cast aside, in order that
§. ladies and young gentlemen may break their hearts over the sorrows of
igamists and adulterers, we confess that the impression made upon our minds is
not very flattering—we do not say to the tastes, but to the moral sense of the age.”
Girls nowadays, I fancy, but seldom go to school: in fact, there are
no girls’ schools in these euphemistic days, for they either are called
“seminaries,” or, more grandly, “ladies' colleges.” Still, I dare say
you have had some sort of mental culture, and you would doubtless be
indignant if I questioned, your belonging to the “educated classes.”
Yet how little has your mind been cultured in reality; if it finds plea-
sure in the sorrows of the interesting bigamists who figure in so many
flashy novels of the day! Such “light literature” as this to me is
very heavy reading, and I am astonished that a girl of any sense of
what is delicate and feminine, can find the slightest pleasure in it. I
should as soon expect to see her read the Newgate Calendar, or devour
morning-calling, lunching, riding, kettle-
fêtes and flower-shows are in prospect,
; or what toilettes ravissantes were worn
the latest dirt which is dug up in the Divorce Court. To say nothing
of propriety, there is far more life and interest in one of Scott's fine
nºvels than in a score of Frenchy fast sensation stories, which are as
false to nature as they are false to art." Yet Guy Mannering and
Waverley are left upon the shelf while ladies sigh over the sorrows of
Dora the Deserted, or wonder what will be the end of Miriam and her
Mysteries, or breathlessly await the coming magazines, which will con-
|tinue the sad story of Laura, the Lone One, or the Wife of Seven Hus.
bands, or will reveal the thrilling fate of the Mormonite Unmasked.
Love: Marriage: Murder: Mystery: there is plenty of all these in
the tales which Scott has written, and there is plenty of a hundred
|other interesting themes. Where is such pleasant history as Scott
§. in his novels? Where are kings and queens and court-scenes
rought sº, vividly to life again? Where are ancient rites and customs
so truthfully described P ... Where else is such poetic word-painting of
scenery: such close, insight into character: such humour and such
|pathos: such naturalness of dialogue: such variety of incident: such
|vigºur of invention; and, as in the Bride of Lammermoor, for instance,
such poetry of passion, and such poetry of prose? Yet far too com:
monly will a young º leave unnoticed and untouched this “well of
English undefiled,” and will drink in with delight the tales of trashy
writers, who draw their inspiration from the cesspool and the sink.
Yes, I know these are strong words; but when I happen to feel
strongly I must use words to match. You may call mean Öſd Grumpy,
or a Great Big Silly, and may pout your pretty lips at the lecture I am
giving you; but you will owe me many a kiss for many a happy hour,
if I persuade º to. follow the advice of the Quarterly, and read

use a sporting phrase, which I dare say you will not want your brother

(Interesting Incident in the Experience of MR. HomeGREEN.)
WHEN I was up in London, as it happened t'other day,
From Richmond back droo Hammersmith to town upon my way,
When I’d got zummut past the Bridge, a new sight there I see,
A Pig a §§ of a man, as willun as could be.
A ragamuffin kind o' chap the feller was to view;
His four-legged follerer by fur the clanest o' the two.
However, that there man had got command o' that ere Hog,
As trotted along arter unlike any spannel dog.
A whity-brownish coloured Pig, looked nigh about five score;
But, big or little, sitch a Pig I never see'd afore.
I’d heerd about a sportsman as for pointer had a sow,
Which story you may doubt on, but I quite believes it now.
Sometimes Pig lagged behind a bit, then on again a'd run,
Soon as his master whistled to 'n, and cut to heel like fun.
I wonder, now, if ever they’ll put up that Pig to fat.
I thinks I shouldn’t have the heart to kill a Pig like that.
That there Pig and the Larned Pig's relations, I should say.
His teachun 'oodn’t, anyhow, be all on't throw'd away.
Was other Pigs all sitch as that, we mightn't gridge the State

THE REWARD OF WALOUR. |
The subjoined announcement will perhaps evoke a remark from more
than one young officer in a “crack” corps :-
“BATTA To THE Abyssini.AN Expedition ARY. Force.—According to the custom
in the Indian army at the close of a war, the Indian troops in Abyssinia, with their
officers of all ranks, will in all probability be granted batta, or extra pay, as a
reward for their suffering and toil on active service. The batta usually means one
year's extra pay.”
. The remark will perhaps be that batta pudding is better than par- |
liamentary praise. A member of the Rag and Famish may be ex-
pected at least to know that there is such a thing as batter pudding.

MURPHY AND WHALLEY.
IT may have appeared to reasonable people that certain genteel
persons with ritualistic proclivities make two mistakes when they call
everybody, who, in any respect, tries to oppose or controvert Romanism
and Roman Priests, a WHALLEy; the first mistake being that no such
controversy and opposition can possibly be based on liberal principle,
and the second that the name of WHALLEY is as synonymous as it is
symphonious with folly. The second mistake, in rational estimation,
may seem as great as the first certainly is.
A letter, however, in the Times, signed John PAGE HoPPs, dated at
“The Parsonage, Dunkinfield,” on “The MURPHY Riots,” informs the
civilised world that:-
“Mr. WHALLEY told the House of Commons on Monday night that “a more
honest, truthful, and he might almost say, a more careful man in his statements
had never appeared as a public lecturer than MR. MURPHY.’”
MR. HoPPs, in illustration of the extent to which this declaration is
true, tells us that, in January last, MURPHY began a lecture at Staley-
bridge by producing, without any provocation, a ten-chambered re-
volver, and saying, “I’m a queer lad, as you’ll find out yet,” that he
next threatened to smash something or somebody, and then offered
up a prayer. Here follows a passage from MURPHY's lecture:-
“The way to get rid of Fenianism is to hang the priests. Every priest is a
Fenian head-centre. I am going to Ashton to lecture in a cotton mill, and within
300 or 400 yards of the Catholic chapel, and it will not take as long to drive the
jº. lambs to Paddy's land. If the people once break out in Lancashire, they
will first seize the Catholic priests, then the Sisters of Mercy, and afterwards the
lambs, and send them all afloat, neck and crop.”
If MR. HoPPs has not been misinformed respecting the demeanour
and language above reported, there are only two suppositions whereon
those peculiarities can be conceivably accounted for. Either MR.
MURPHY was lecturing under the influence of excess in whiskey, or
else in a state of excitement and absurd persuasion arising from mere
disorder or lesion of the brain, On the former hypothesis he ought to
have been put, if possible, in the stocks: on the latter he should be
immediately taken care of before he does himself or others some mis-
chief beyond that of provoking Irishmen to attempt to refute imputa-
tions on their religion by rioting. His friends should look after him in
the interest of Protestantism as well as for his own sake; and those of
MR, WHALLEY, if WHALLEY knows how MURPHY has been raving,
ought also to take care of him. Hanwell or Colney Hatch might

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 25. This Derby week was so horribly and indescribably
dull, Parliamentarilily (spell that after dinner, WINoso) ºf: that
Mr. Punch felt inclined to dispose of the proceedings in a single line, in
which the two words Scotland and Boredom should be, the nouns;
But he scorns to yield to his inclinations, being lord of himself and
all that. Don't blame him, however, because your legislators were not
amusing. There were one or two episodes that may be worth notice—
to the hot weather, and it may be to the means resorted to in com-
pensation, is chiefly due the state of affairs.
Mr. DisrAELI was asked whether Government, would not defend
Mr. Eyre against the Negromaniacs. He replied that it would not,
but that he reserved the right, after the trial, to appeal to the Houses
in favour of MR. EYRE. Such would not have been the answer of
Lord PALMERston. We can hear the fine old English gentleman.
*Sir, Her Majesty's Government may not give unqualified approbation |
to all that was done for the purpose of making, an example that should
deter conspirators and savages, but believing that MR, EYME rendered
signal service to the Crown, and that he acted to the best of his judg-
ment in a terrible emergency, the Government would feel that it shrank
from its duty to a public servant, were not my learned friend the
Attorney-General to undertake MR. Eyre's defence against inveterate
persecution by an irresponsible Junta.” And we hear the cheers that
MR. DISRAELI has missed. -
MR. BRIGHT made a solemn appeal to the Home Secretary to give
Michael BARRETT, twice convicted of murdering and mutilating men,
women, and children by the Clerkenwell explosion, a third chance of
escaping the gallows. MR HARDY replied that the only ground for
reprieving BARRETT was the desire to investigate the evidence of an
alibi, which had utterly broken down. ...About fifteen hours later the
Fenian assassin was hanged, and he will be remembered by his atro-
cious crime, and by his being the last felon publicly executed in this
country. Apropos whereof, a curious piece of biography has been
issued. Some of the Gushers who write articles in the provincial
papers have improved the occasion, and have abused CALCRAFT, the
executioner, on general grounds. A clergyman addresses the Telegraph
as followeth :-
“As the minister of the church in which he worships, I happen to know the
man, and a more worthy creature does not exist. * * * He is a good and tender-
hearted man, an habitual frequenter of a Church of England place of worship,
where his white head and venerable appearance is pleasingly conspicuous, though
his identity is not generally known among the congregation-, * * * He is by trade a
shoemaker, and you might deal with him all your life, and have no more idea that
he was the common hangman than that he was the Grand Lama of Thibet. He is a
very devout attendant upon public ...? and a man of very simple and straight-
forward mind, fulfilling all the relations of domestic and social life in a kindly and
affectionate manner."
Something of the same sort (deducting the .. of course) was
written about the Frenchman SANson. It may be true, but if a
living could be got by shoe-making, it would scarcely occur to shoe-
makers of average amiability to improve their income by killing people.
In America the engine of death is nearly self-acting, and no regular
executioner is needed, a fact which may be commended to the attention
of MR. JonAs, the admirable Governor of Newgate.
Then, and also on Thursday, the House went into Committee, and
discussed the details of the Scotch Reform Bill. Of course Mr. Punch
is not going to bother you with such things, but when the Bill is com-
plete, he will tell you as much about it as you care to know. MR.
DisRAELI got the Committee to reverse, practically, the decision which
enacted Household Suffrage pure, and simple, and the Scotch are to
have but seven of the condemned little boroughs, three of the ten being
reprieved. MR. MILL made a stand for fair play and the triangular
vote, and MR. BRIGHT opposed both.
Tuesday. The Lords debated MR. To RRENs's Bill for improving the
dwellings of artizans, and LoRD CHELMSFORD made out so strong a
case for it, that it might well have been passed at once, but it goes
to a Select Committee, and may be lost altogether.
The Roman Catholic bishops, having signified that they will accept
the proposed College only on such terms as no Protestant Government
can accord, the negotiation falls to the ground, and the Cabinet is free
to cry, “ No Popery 1” -
MR. LABoucheap gained a little victory over the Government,
carrying by 76 to 72 a resolution that the sums granted for diplomatic
services should be submitted to Parliament in detail. LoRD STANLEY
said that this would transfer responsibility from the Foreign Office to
the House... But that is in accordance with what the present Cabinet
calls, its principles. Then, this being the Eve of the Derby, Members
çould not be bored with a discussion on the best means of preventing
Colliery accidents—how could you expect it?—and were Counted.
Wednesday. The Derby. A splendid day. All the world at Epsom.
Our contemporary above cited describes the business of the day thus:—
“A scramble to the Downs, ample eating and drinking, a minute's mad excite-
ment, more eating and drinking, and then home from " the Isthmian games,” with
much foolish horseplay, and British efforts to be joyous, which means but too often
being noisy, stupid, brutal, and drunk."
Mr. Punch speaks of himself as he finds himself, and respectfully
asserts that he did not scramble, was never madly excited, acted no
horseplay except a game at sweep-stake, and does not exactly re-
member having been either noisy, stupid, or brutal. Lady Elizabeth,
LoRD HASTINGs's mare and the favourite, displayed unladylike temper,
and was nearly last, and the winner was SIR Joseph HAwley's Blue-
: as predicted by Mr. Punch, who explains his vaticination else-
wnere.
Thursday, Scotch debate as above, and the only amusing incident
was this. MR. LIDDELL had remarked on MR. BRIGHT’s devotion to
American principles. MR. BRIGHT politely rejoined,
h -- º: is not a syllable of truth in what the honourable gentleman
as said.”
The CHAIRMAN apprised MR. BRIGHT that his language was in
excess of Parliamentary usage.
MR. BRIGHT had no doubt that MR. LIDDELL had spoken in mistake.
MR. Lippell, said that at all events MR. BRIGHT was evidently an
admirer of American manners.
Friday. A great thunderstorm came to-day, and with it woe to the
ladies who went in brilliant garments to the §§.
“Desinatin Piscem Mulier Formosa superne;”
which, being interpreted, means that the Woman who went to see
Formosa win ended as wet as a Fish.
But the Storm did not get rid of the Electricity in either House,
and the night was tempestuous. After Royal Assent to piles of laws,
including the Private Execution Bill,
LORD RUssell made a fierce onslaught upon Ministers, declared
them not to have the confidence of the Commons, and hoped that, in
the new Parliament, they would not unconstitutionally seek to keep
place if that House voted against the Irish Church. LoRD MALMES-
BURY replied that the Government had the confidence of the House in
regard to many important measures, and, when the new House met,
LoRD Russkii's friends might move an adverse vote. Then my Lords
“º till the 8th June.
e were miscellaneous, in the Commons. Condemnation of the
MURPHY riots was º MR. WHALLEY, justified MURPHY, on
the ground that his father had been stoned to death at the bidding of
an Irish º: Filial vengeance has been respectable since the days of
Qrestes, but it has usually been expended on the right people, not on
folks who had nothing to do with the offence, and it is time that MR.
MURPHY's tender affection should command itself.
Fight on the site of the Law Courts, which most people think
should be placed on the Embankment. , Lord JoHN MANNERs says
that the question is Decided; but surely a Parliament, like a Disraeli
Minister, may change its mind.
Then a question by MR. W. E. ForstER as to Dissolution, brought
on some hot firing. LoRD ELCHQ hoped that the Ministers would not
be in a hurry, as he wanted to make holiday in August and September,
and not be bothered with Electioneering. MR. GLADston E, who pro-
bably does not want to make holiday in August and September, was
very severe upon stress being laid on such a trifle. Mr. Punch, who
not only does want, but intends to make holiday in August, and Sep-
tember, and October, too, doesn’t care a farthing which way the office-
holders and office-wanters settle it—he goes off, weather or no. There
was no definite information to be got out of the Cabinet, and so the
House rose until the following Thursday.
HAYTI.TIGHTY!
THE Jamaica Committee will have been pained to learn, by telegram
received at Liverpool on Thursday, that:-
“Anarchy reigned at Port-au-Prince, and the stores had been pillaged and many
civilians shot. The British Consul was endeavouring to stop the outrages when the
steamer sailed.”
As Hayti is not a British possession, the Jamaica Committee, if the
British Consul shall be found to have taken the law into his own
hands when Anarchy was reigning at Port-au-Prince, and to have
º the outrages by what they may consider too strong measures,
will be unable to prosecute him.

CHAPTER XXVI.
TBIE BROTHERS.
STRUGGLING, battling manfully with the waves beating upon the
lower rocks beneath Old MARTIN's cottage, came ashore, upon the
eventful evening which has occupied the last few chapters, the body of
a man, old before his time, grasping in his right hand a bottle and a
lump of sugar.
He lay for some seconds extended upon the beach, until another
wave more furious than that which had stranded him, turned him and
tossed him over, like a giant at play with an empty butter-cask, and
§ him as it were a last kick, retired again into his ocean cave,
º: in his breath with a chuckling roar over the broken state of
s old toy.
'Twas the sea's last effort, a grand one, and then it ºr. retreating,
like a cowardly giant as it was, to go and play with huge ships for
shuttlecocks and vast rocks for marbles on the other side of the world.
The form on the beach moved, stretched, and finally sat upright: a
bottle in one hand, a lump of sugar in the other.
“Confound them for a couple of idiots! Commit me to the sea when
they hadn’t given themselves or me, for the matter of that, time to know
whether I was dead or not l” muttered the figure in a grumbling tone.
Then he poured three drops of “stuff,” as it was labelled, upon a
lump of sugar, and placing the latter in his mouth, soon appeared
much invigorated. -
“A murrain on the jadel” he exclaimed, trying to rise, “an she
hath not given me, cramps and agues, and a tertian, it may hap
enough to last me till next Martinmas, may I never crush cup or
demolish pasty more.” "
Rising with some difficulty, the Lieutenant, for, as our readers have
probably already divined, it was indeed he, commenced the ascent of
the crag overhead.
“Come Martinmas!” he said to himself, "odd that the name of
MARTIN should occur to me now. My poor brother! But for a quarrel
about some, wretched property and a title (may all ill light upon such
causes of disagreement') we should have been living together now,
and he would perhaps have been an Admiral.”
The past seemed like a dream to him: NUTT, GRACE, the Pangoſ-
flins, the fatal sugar, the Castor oil, all had passed away like the
fashions of a kaleidoscope. It was evident to him that while in a trance
they had, as we, being truthful historians, have stated in another
place, committed him early on the fifth morning of their floating-house
voyage to an ocean grave, which is as much as to say they pitched him
over. And we added, “interred him decently;” that is
turned him out well, as became a faithful niece and attached servant.
So as he strode up the crag the thought recurred to him, and he
questioned in his heart the treatment he had received at their hands.
“Pitched over! Turned out !” he went on, harping upon these
grievances until the balmy air of morn, stealing from the far west, crept
in among his grey hairs and whispered peace. -
A harmony as from another world seemed round about his head,
He clasped his hands, and with a smiling self-devotion looked up-
wards as he murmured softly, so softly, to himself,
“A singing ! in my ears! Ah! happy childhood!”
Then in reverent spirit he doffed that weather-beaten hat, and moved
in a gay and stately manner, reminding the looker-on of the expressive
joyous occasion of an old Castilian, whose blue blood would have been
stirred by the sight of some wild deeds, of chivalry, or some Moorish
dº biting the dust before the sainted banner of Compostello.

!,
An old man above, from a window where he had crept to see “the
blessed sun before life ebbed.”" -
He could only feebly breathe “Hi!” -
The sound attracted the Lieutenant's attention.
He ran towards the door.
It was MARTIN's cottage.
He lifted the latch, and quick as lightning threw the bottle towards
the sinking figure, who, guarding his head by the instinct which even
men in the last stage have of self-preservation, seized it, and drained
it to the dregs.
The morning sun shone in. -
“My Preserver !” exclaimed old MARTIN, rushing madly towards
the Lieutenant. - - -
“My Life preserver !” ejaculated the Lieutenant, feeling in the
vest of his uniform.
Within an inch of each other both started back.
“It cannot be l’” was their one exclamation.
Then MARTIN, holding off from the other at a foot's length, stared
straight in his face, and asked rapidly,
“CHARLEs AUGUSTU's LEONARD P”
And the other replied with an interrogatory:
*MATTHEw MARMADUKE MARTIN ?”
The two old men were in each other's arms.
“My brother l my dear brother!” each cried.
In that moment all was forgotten and forgiven. Explanations
quickly followed, and MARTIN, or as we must now call him TTHEW
MARMADUKE MARTIN MARchMont, put it clearly to the Tieutenant,
his elder brother, how when they had both married, he had never
intended to hurt his feelings, by taking the girl who should have been
his brother CHARLEs’s bride; while a similar assurance on the part of
AUGUSTU's LEONARD soon cleared the veil of doubt and mystery from
the heart of the younger, though now old, MARTIN.
One other explanation.
CHARLEs LEONARD asked,
“How is my daughter P”
Old MARTIN replied, trembling.
“CHARLEs, she thought me dead, a villain has her in his power, but
I dare say Joseph, her lover, will find her.”
Then it was Old MARTIN's turn to ask,
“How is my daughter P”
“GRACE is lost at sea,” was the Lieutenant's hurried reply. “The
young scapegrace, buried me; but if we take a ship (you want a little
change of air, so do I), I dare say we shall find her somewhere about
the Pacific.”
For each old 'man had, out of revenge, in early days, stolen the
other's daughter when a child ;, and the one, GRACE, had been brought
up as CHARLEs MARCHMONT's niece, as indeed she was; while the
other was called Old MARTIN's daughter, as indeed she wasn't.
“The first thing then is,” said the Lieutenant,
“To get—”
“A SHIP.”
- º º * + + * +
They had been at sea three days,
These two old men.
“Steer to the right, MARMADUKE MATTHEw MARTIN, will you?”
said the Lieutenant.
t I will Not, AUGUSTUs LEONARD CHARLEs,” was his stern relation's
return.
“If you don't,” retorted AUGUSTU's LEONARD, irritably, “I’ll break
your old head.”
“Break my old head, you—”
Angry words might have followed but for the intervention of CoM-
MANDER BOUNCER, a veteran Horse Marine, who had been in the service
ever since that peculiar branch of it had been first organised, and who
had kindly undertaken the conduct of this expedition.
...Hold Hard!”.said CoMMANDER BounceR.
His ship, by the way, which before was called the Gemini, had now
been re-christened the Penelope Anne, Owner Knox.
...Don't let’s have norumpus,” was the Commander's homely advice.
The old men wept in each other's arms,
Now then,” said the Commander, “You two go up aloft, one on
the mast-head, 'tother on the jib-boom, and keep a lookout.”
Away they went up the rigging.
Then, they sailed on, the Commander steering.
On the sixth, day, the two old men never having moved from their
Pºsition, the loblolly boy caught a fish which was hauled upon deck.
The fish was a flying one apparently, but on opening it they found it
swallowed a small fat bird, whose wings were sticking out.
On this bird was a card of invitation.
It was the Round Robin.
On it was Miss MARCHMONT's name.
* The Editor, at the request of the authors of the Boomerang portion, who have
º proofs as per agreement, wishes to know from what poet this quotation
*ny Member of Parliament in the habit of quoting; and read, Sir, read.
Then the sailors hoorayed for joy, and the Lieutenant gave them
three pound six and eightpence halfpenny all round, and entered it all
in his private account book with a share of three-quarters of the whole
sum down to his brother, to be repaid when he came into his fortune.
Then the Commander liquored up freely, and the two old men wept
again in each other's arms.
Then they thought they saw something.
They sailed to the right, according to the direction on the card, and
within a few hours, the Commandertaking a second and a stiffer glass,
made out
EEL Pre IsIAND, and GREEN FAT."
Then the Sailors cheered the Lieutenant, who bowed courteously
from the masthead, and distributed sovereigns among the men, who
had already begun to pity the poor old gentleman, as a harmless
lunatic not very distantly related to the Flying Dutchman.
|. So they sailed on. MARTIN at the prow, BounceR at the helm, the
Lieutenant, like the good Cherub, smiling aloft, and ...; watch on
the life º poor Jack below; then onward sped that good ship, the
Penelope Anne.
(To be continued.)
* The Editor compliments the PIEL-Dornton-portion Authors on so readily
falling in with the romantic notion of the Boomerang authors. The Editor does
hope that they'll all work together with a will for the finish, which is now rapidly
approaching.
PUNCH'S DERBY PROPHECY FULFILLED.
ERE you are again, and such of you
as followed the advice of your
only true and faithful friend,
Punch, have won a pot of money,
and can afford to take your lovely
and attached charmers to Ascot.
Now, my noble sportsmen, what
did I tell you? I gave you the
right tip, while all the other
prophets (except the Star and
the Era) led their too confiding
victims into dreadful bogs and
abyssmal quagmires, where they
are now wallowing in the cold
abjectness of disappointment and
dismay. Let us hooray over them,
for two-thirds of the pleasure of
life is beholding the deserved
misfortunes of others. Hooray,
accordingly. And now what did
I say? This:-
“THE WINNER will BE A WomſAN OF FASHION COMING DOWN TO
|BREAKFAST IN A CountRY House.”
What does that mean? That Blue being a fashionable morning colour, a lady will
probably come down in a Blue-gown? No, Sirs, though that would be a much more
explicit prophecy than nine out of ten of my contemporary prophets dare risk.
| No, Sirs. But it means this:—
THE WINNER will BE THE ONE THAT IS IN THE GREATEST HURRY TO GET AT
| THE Post.
Now then?
A WORD TO THE WITLERS.
Punch recommends his beloved friends, the Licensed Victuallers,
to give up, for a short time, the pleasure of holding blatant meetings
for self-protection, and talking tall nonsense under the presidency of
fifth-rate members of Parliament, and to take notice of evidence which
is being given to the House of Commons on the part of the artisan
|class. “Mr. Potter, and other officials of unions, associations, and the
| like, are assuring the House that the workmen desire stringently
| restrictive measures as to the sale of liquor, not only on Sundays, but
at other times. That the most skilful, drink, the most, and pray to be
protected against themselves. That they wish beer were a guinea a
pot. That the fault of the Sunday Bill is that it is not half strong
enough, and much more, to that effect. Now it does not in the least
matter, for the present purpose, how far these witnesses are authorised,
or whether they desire a wise and just thing. Their evidence has
reat weight and will be listened to. And it will be quoted, if not now,
y the next Chancellor of Exchequer, who is notoriously inclined to
be as hard as he can upon the Drink trade. But the blessed Bungs
won't pay attention to all this. It is, so much easier to drink toasts
and cheer a rampant secretary describing a Publican, as the nearest
| likeness to an Angel which this world affords. Why is not the great
|body of artisans appealed to, and asked whether they want the sort of
4 ºr of Authors of the Pia Dornton part—what not know that, ºr consult legislation desired by MR. Pºrºk?
| Are they virtuous, and
shall there be no more cakes and ale?

THEi i}+ORSE SHOW.
--
'mist the Derhy week is on, there are few people
who would not give it as their opinion that the
“proper study of mankind is—horse”. There
| is an equine flavour pervading society during that
period, as there is undoubtedly a beefy odour throughout London at
the Cattle Show season, the latter being possibly accounted for by the
superabundance of ox-ygen in the air. Following close upon the wild
excitement of the Derby and the Oaks comes the calmer attraction of
the Islington show, and in admiring the animals when quiescent in
their stalls or careering proudly round the centre, the real admirer of
the noble brute who has won his money may spend it profitably in
some judicious purchases, whilst the sight cannot ſail to be gratifying
to the luckless speculator who has backed his Lady Elizabeth, and has
lost heavily by his Bet.
Irrespective of the actual entertainment derived by witnessing the
Show, the contemplation of the animals must have its due effect upon
those heartless utilitarians who would degrade the horse to the level of
the dinner-table, and who, in talking of “stakes,” are apt to confuse
the legitimate meaning of the word with another—a juicier and more
revolting one, repulsive alike to the admirer of the genuine article at
fourteenpence per pound, and the respecter of the “friend of man.”
On the present occasion it is true there was a grim suggestion of
what in this horribly practical age might occur some day in the presence
of a new kind of sausage machine; but we trust it was admitted by
accident, and was not deliberately placed in a prominent position, as a
moral warning to the animals after the manner of those jolly ancient
gourmets, who couldn’t enjoy their banquet without the presence of a
skeleton; a cheerful addition, at once suggestive of the hollowness of
worldly delights, and the advantage of picking one's bones. Be that
as it may, we for one hope the day is far distant when there shall be a
run upon collared horse, or a lively demand in the poorer neighbour-
hoods for “a pound of nice horse-ages.”
One is not required to have what is technically termed “an eye for
a horse” to see the vast superiority of a Show like the one at the
Agricultural Hall over such an exhibition as the Derby, as a means
towards the legitimate end; namely, the improvement of the quadruped
himself. Where at Epsom one seldom sees anything but lean fine
drawn weedy specimens, fleet of foot and delicate as Italian greyhounds,
at Islington one beholds a collection of honest, full-grown, well de-
veloped sturdy fellows, up to weight, fine enduring wholesome looking
animals of all sorts, shapes and sizes. The present show was no
exception to the rule.
As usual, however, human judgment was not considered infallible,
and some of the judicial decisions of the noblemen and gentlemen who
awarded the prizes were received with anything but favour by the
spectators. Many well conducted persons indeed went so far as to
hiss, hoot, and yell at the lucky recipients of the judges' approval, and
to receive the less fortunate animals with extravagant applause.
Prominent amongst the unlucky ones was Samson, to our fancy a
grand animal, who on the second day distinguished himself beyond all
others at leaping, being magnificently ridden by MR. Hawes, who was
evidently destined to
“Witch the world with noble Hawesmanship."
and who took a fence after a fence with excellent temper.
The PRINCE of WALes's Knight of St. Patrick, which took the
second prize amongst the weight-carrying hunters, was a decided suc-
cess; but his Royal Highness's Rupee was not a popular prizeholder.
We should, however, fancy the mare to be exceedingly fleet, indeed
Rupee struck us as being a kind of foreign coin which any one would
find very difficult to pass. And here let us protest against the hideous
habit of shortening the horse's tail in a barbarous manner, which in
many instances brought before our mind's eye vivid recollections of
old Newmarket nags in black wooden frames, plentifully flyblown, in
the rusty inn parlours of bygone days. Some of the tails in the present
instance were the merest paragraphs. Such, mutilation should be
felony, and on the homoeopathic principle, for those who cut short a
horse's tail, the consequences should be decidedly the dock.
We would also urge the advisability of the persons who show off the
animals taking a few lessons in horseriding between this Show and the
one next year. In more senses than one fl. was a great falling off
this June; indeed, so often did some of the would-be huntsmen come
to the ground, that we were surprised they did not occasionally indulge
in that exciting and suggestive sporting exclamation, “Tan-tivy '''
On the whole, however, the Fifth Annual Horse Show was the best
we have had, and though the prices attached to some of the numbers
were rather extravagant, they were no º like bets when lost by
ladies, not expected to be paid. The behaviour of the animals in their
stalls and boxes was a striking example for certain frequenters of other
stalls and boxes, who are supposed to be as well bred, but who might
in many instances take a profitable lesson from the more quietly con-
ducted denizens of the Agricultural *
* We may add, * the only disappointment we met with was the
absence of a Suffolk Punch (which we held to be a personal slight);
that we were totally at a loss to discover the connection between a
Horse Show and a patent pea-sheller; that the Prince's white Arabian
was the popular attraction with the ladies, whilst the favourite judge
with the horses themselves was evidently Colonel, HAY.
TWO WAYS WITH RASCALDOM.
TheRE are two ways of doing most things, to say nothing of masterly
inactivity, or not doing them at all, which is pleasantest in hot weather.
We all know the extreme politeness displayed by our excellent Police
Magistrates towards criminals, and the careful avoidance of any ex-
pressions likely to wound the feelings of those interesting objects, and
to notify to them the opinion of Society on their doings. That is one
way.
h In America there is another. We learn from the New York Leader
that—
“Judge Dowlina, of Boston, is eminently fitted for his position. He is prompt,
intelligent, decided, humane. He will get through a hundred cases in an hour,
Discharge, fine, imprisonment, follow rapidly, mingled with paternal advice.”
And the writer follows this †: which we understand is really
deserved, by a specimen of Judge Dowling's talk to a rascal.
“A man complains of a girl for º his windows. The Judge gets at the
story in a minute. “So you turned her out of doors, and she smashed your windows,
did she 7 I wish she had broken your head. Great, idle, lazy vagabond, living on
the blood and bones of these poor creatures; if I catch you in my court again. I'll
send you up for six months. Clear out!" And the chap-fallen fellow leaves the
court-room. The prisoner is in great glee, but is instantly sobered as the Judge
turns to her and says: “Look here, # you break that man's windows again, or
disturb him in any way, I'll send yow up for six months. Now go.'"
That, as we have said, is the other way. We are not sure that it has |
not its merits. It is the way Punch talks to sundry.
–-
The Way to Rule the waves.
THE thanks of the British Nation are due to the Admiralty for
having provided it with Naval Defences, described by the Times as “a
fleet of ironclad broadsides, which can only fire, their guns in such
exceptional weather as cannot º be anticipated for a naval action.”
It may be said that these Men-of-War, like KNicKeRBookeR's Dutch
Emigrant Ship, are likely to be particularly great in a calm. But per-
haps that is too much to say; and all that can be safely asserted is,
that the British Navy will be unable to fight in rough water.

[June 13, 1868.
M.R. PUNCH*S DESIGN's AFTER NATURE.
The DOVE STYLE.
A WORD WITH A YENGEE.
A cleven American gentleman, who writes in Tinsley, and who has
told us some wholesome truths about sundry Englishisms, which we
frankly admit to be absurdities, has, in his last Paper, attacked us on
the subject of Theatres and Music Halls. We do not consider an
American a foreigner, but we will call this writer so, pro hde vice; as,
but for his being a stranger, we should not have answered him. “Let
them rave,” is Mr. Punch's motto, when abused. This gentleman,
after a contrast between the English and the American stage, and after
assigning great superiority to the actors on the latter (the samples we
get seldom justify his sentence), makes a stand for the Music Halls
and their Music. Further, he intimates that Punch depreciates, both,
because certain of his young men are theatrical authors. That is cer-
tainly not his reason, nor is it a natural one, as theatrical authors are
generally much more inclined to castigate Managers than to fondle
them. As regards the music, minus the words, he has no further
objection to it, than that it is of a low type, despite the fact that most
of the very successful tunes are stolen from the French, or other sources.
The words usually sung are so utterly idiotic that it is hardly worth
while to express contempt for them, or for those who applaud them.
But for the Music Hall itself he has a hatred, which is so well vindi-
cated in the following paragraph, that he will spare himself the trouble
of inditing another. This is from an article in the First Number of the
New Series of the Gentleman’s Magazine (which periodical he hereby
takes the opportunity of mildly puffing, by merely saying that the man
or Person who does not read it is guilty of Voluntary Lunacy), and
here is Mr. Punch's reason for his hostility to the Music Hall:—
“The Music Halls encourage drinking. By an air of respectability, assumed as
a ‘cloak to carry on the trade,’ families of the bourgeois class are induced to fre-
quent them, and are thereby brought into social contact with the profligate and
abandoned of both sexes."
Add, that the young are thus led into temptation, and frequently into
crime, and we have done. But we ourselves are quite willing to
“encourage drinking” to the extent of saying to our American critic,
“Let us liquor up.”
WHAT MR. Hoyt E is AND has No LoNGER.—The Lyons' cher.
TO THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, K.G.
MY DEAR GEORGE. - -
I shall, publish this letter, but by Jove, old fellow, you
scarcely deserve it. . - -
I read, in the Imperial Review, this,
“We are informed that at a public dinner last week the proceedings of which
were not reported, his Royal Highness THE Duke of CAMERIDGE refered pointedly
to the late caricature of him in Punch, which represented him as “knowing nothing
of " Sir R. NAPIER. His Royal HighNess declared emphatically that, so far from
such being the case, he was the first person to suggest the name of the gallant
general to the Cabinet for the command in Abyssinia.”
Now, first, my dear GeoRGE, as to the manner of this proceeding of
yours, and then as to the matter.
Either the courage or the kind feeling for which your family and
yourself are distinguished must have failed you when you saw my
Cartoon. Else, mon vieur, you would not have waited for a public
dinner at which to express your sensations, but you would have driven
down here, as you have done hundreds of times, and over a cool drink
and a cigar have had the affair out with me, and received the explana-
tion which †. give me the trouble to make with the thermometer at
80° in the shade. Or, at worst, you might have sent GENERAL FoastER
to know whether you had annoyed me. I would not have chaffed him,
at least not more than was good for his soul.
But, as to the matter to which you have referred pointedly (that
means, I suppose, that you pointed at my picture), P. truly say,
my GEORGE, that I had no intention of wounding your feelings. I make
allowances for a Royal Duke who associates with old Generals, and that
kind of intellect, but you ought to have seen, and have been sure, that
the Portrait which you have chosen to imagine meant my personal
friend, George, Duke of CAMBRIDGE, meant him in his official capa-
City, as Head, of the Horse Guards. I like you very much, as you
know, and I believe you to be an excellent Duke and good fellow,
with the interests of your Cousin's Army, and of your º very
much at heart. Moreover, are we not, as I have said, personal friends,
and have I not glorified you in many Pictures? Do you not recollect
how I applauded your accession to the Head of the Army, your deal.
ing with coarse young officers, and other merits?... And if I could
forget your good deeds, and our private regard, would I have willingly
been unkind to the Cousin of my Queen? By Jove, George, I am
nearly ºf riled in trying to un-rile you. Your health, however.
But º ear Commander-in-Chief, business is business. I am
hearily glad to know from yourself that you suggested NAPIER for
Abyssinia, and from other trustworthy witnesses that you exerted
yourself strenuously to prevent that Indian officer from being hindered
by prejudice, Forsterism, and red tape, and that º were most laudably
prompt to get the Decoration sent out to him the moment we heard of
his triumphs. I rejoice that your own excellent nature, and my teach:
": have combined to induce you to see things in the right way, and
I have no doubt that you will signalise yourself still further as becomes
the Head of the Army. But you know that I have had for years the
most awful struggle with the º of which, in my picture, I
made you the type. Remember the days of the Crimea. Remember
how I have had to fight for reforms, which are even now but half
accorded. Tell me, my dear George, is not SiR Robert NAPIER the
very first officer of Engineers to whom command has been given?
am more than happy that it has been your hand that has broken the
red-tape chain, but the breakage is of the latest, and you know best
how the old fogies like it. I am quite justified in still considering the
Horse Guards very much behind the time, while I congratulate you,
my Royal George, in keeping up with it.
There, my gallant friend, I hope that explanation pleases you, and
that you are vexed with yourself for not having come down to my
office, and had it out there. However, I forgive you, or rather, I have
nothing to forgive. Come down as usual, and the sooner the better,
for I have just opened a prime lot of weeds, on which I should like
our opinion. Bring old Forster, if you like, for I am rather fond of
lin. Ever, my dear George,
Yours affectionately,
85, Fleet Street. 49&ANCA.
P.S. You are quite wrong in being obstinate against the bit of brass
on the soldier's shoulder. Read Hozier, and learn how that little defence
saved hundreds of men from being cut down.

Family Man. “WHERE Do You Go THIs YEAR, JINNINGs "
WHERE 'You off to ?”
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
THURSDAY, June 4. The House of Commons (a very small one) met
after the Whitsuntide Holidays, and Punch was reminded of a verse in
a gallant old ballad by JAMEs Hogg, a poet of whom Scotland is not
half so proud as she ought to be—
“Rough was the onset—boast, nor threat,
Nor cry was heard from friend or foe;
At once began the work of fate,
With perilous thrust and deadly blow.”
Scarcely were Members in their places, when SIR THoMAs BATE-
son, Member for Devizes, and Conservative, demanded of the PREMIER
whether his attention had been called to a letter signed by MR. GLAD-
stone, and published for the benefit of the Liberals (who won) at the
East Worcestershire Election. In that letter the writer accused the
Ministers of proposing to endow the Catholic Church in Ireland, and
to create a Catholic University to be paid out of the taxes of the
country.
MR. DISRAELI (with a masterly imitation of the bantering manner of
the late Lord Palmerston). My attention, Sir, is called to most things.
I believed that letter, and still believe it to be, one of those effusions
which, in election language, are sometimes called squibs, and some-
times hoaxes; (Laughter.) It appeared to me to be a gross caricature
of the right hon. gentleman's least º style; and, as it contained
assertions, which could not be proved, and which nothing but the
excitement of an election would justify, I really have given no further
consideration to it. (Loud laughter.)
Mr. Gladstone. Sir, I wish—
Mr. Surtees. Sir, I rise to order. The-
Speaker (sharply and sternly). There is no question of order. You
must not interrupt the proceedings of the House.
Mr. Gladstone. I will speak presently.

[And he says this in anything but a sprightly manner—which was weak and injudicious.
When the Motion for going into Supply came, -
... Mr. GLADSTONE had his innings. He had written the letter, and if
it had helped the Hon. MR. Lyttleton to beat MR. LAslett, was
very glad of it. He was not going to defend his style. But he showed,
with great earnestness and elaboration, that the policy pointed out in
that letter had been the policy of the Cabinet.
MR. DisBAELI, preserving something of his sportive manner, endea-
voured to prove that Ministers had never said anything that amounted
to what MR. GLADstone had charged. The country knew better, he
said, than to believe that he wished to do more than improve the
status of the Catholic Church. -
The battle of the knights was followed by the battle of the squires,
MR. CARDwell and LoRD MAYo having a set-to, which was in favour
of the former. Then the debate went down so low as to include dis-
cussion as to the politics of MR. REARDON | Then it ceased, for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHIKKIN HAZARD.
CHAPTER XXVII.
“MINE FOR EVER 1 "
The waves which had received Joseph when he leapt from the burn-
ing height extinguished such flames as had already caught his dress,
and carried him to shore. -
Thence, after inquiry at Martin's hut, who had by that time de-
parted with the Lieutenant, he at once betook himself to town,
trusting to the information which he was able to gather on, the road
from those who had seen PIEL DoRNToN galloping towards the metro-
polis with a fair burden laid across the horse, as to where Bessy was
imprisoned. -
t first he thought that the best method was to call upon the LoRD
CHANCELLOR, and obtain some letters dimissory or a mandamus; but
on second thoughts he gave up this plan as involving too great a waste
of time and money. - -
e soon began to be aware of several people in disguise following
him wherever he went, and once coming round a corner sharply when
he was evidently supposed to have gone the other way, he discovered a
middle-aged man taking off a false nose and a pair of coloured spectacles.
tº This alarmed him, and in future he only ventured out at night.
One evening he was in St. James's Park when a gentlemanly man
accosted him, asking him if he wanted “a little dawg.
Something about his interrogator's appearance attracted him, and he
was led, contrary to his usual custom, to enter into a conversation
with the man, and while so engaged they drew near the small summer-
house which was built for the sole use of Royalty some years ago, and
which is still a show place for our country cousins, with its grotesque
pictures, its rich velvet-covered sofas, and Dutch mantel-pieces carved
over with the conquests of the Regent, a special attraction perhaps
being that the entrance is gratis, and it can only be seen on certain
days in the year, such days being, among others, if we remember
right, the twenty-ninth of September, the first of April, the glorious
thirty-first of June, and the annual commemoration on the same day in
November.
Hence it was not astonishing that Joseph, new to London as he was,
. have expressed his curiosity to visit the interior of the Royal
our.
The man had the pass-key and admitted him. Joseph sat down to
admire wonders in art quite new to him.
It was a hot day, and he complained of thirst. His new acquaintance,
who appeared to be a sort of a metropolitan farmer, offered to procure
him a delicious draught of curds and whey straight from the cow.
Joseph accepted, and in another second he was alone. -
. He felt in his pocket for the papers, and cursing his own stupidity
in not having secreted them carefully before, he now, with a dim
intuitive perception of coming danger, sewed them into the heels of his him
boots.
Scarcely had he taken this precaution when the man re-appeared,
earing a bowl of the grateful beverage.
After this Joseph knew no more. He drank, and fell, insensible.
The full-length portrait of the Ranger opened, and a tall Inan in a
mask appeared, accompanied by two others in cloaks.
... “Bear him away at once,” said the tallest of the masks, in a tone of
imperious command.
‘Where to, Master DoRNton f" inquired the man who had
administered the potion. -
“Silence, fool!” thundered DoRNTon, for the Mask was he, “Your
incautious folly may ruin us.”
“I beg your honour's pardon,” replied the man, surlily.
“Hold your confounded tongue, Jeremy,” said the younger and
shorter Mask, “if you can, or I'll shoot you as I would a dog.”
“Nay,” interposed the third, who was stouter and of a more noble
bearing. “Poor JEREMY means no harm. What say you, CAPTAIN
DoRNton, whither shall the carrion be borne P’’
PIEL DoRNTon paused, then in a gloomy voice he gave the command—
“To the Black Mine of Cwmdgrwrr. Away !”
They bore his body among them, PIEL DoRNTon controlling their
movements with a revolver which he ever and anon pointed from one
to another as occasion seemed to require.
To the Black Mine of Cwmdgrwrr, in Cornwall.
Then, as they closed the door and departed, he threw aside his disguise.
“I breathe again,” he cried. “Mine | Mine for ever !”
hen he went to Hanover Square.
HANover SQUARE 11
CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE BLUSH ROSE PATTERN.
In an elegant apartment in Hanover Square sat ELIZABETH, the
supposed daughter of Old MARTIN. She was a prisoner, to all intents
and purposes a prisoner, as much was the statue of George CANNING,
which looked sadly down upon the ancient pump below, as if though
they had both been there for years, no one had ever yet had the civility
to ask him to take a drop.
º looked the statue on poor Bessy as she walked to the
window.
She tried to amuse herself with books; but she could not read. The
piano was her only resource: she was entirely ignorant of the practical
science of music, and did not know one note from another, but she
swept her hands indiscriminately over the keys, and made such music
as perhaps few, even proficient in the art, could have heard unmoved.
Then she surveyed the apartment. It was a gorgeously furnished
room. , Chairs of various ornamentation, with figures of sea gods, and
small fishes stood out in bold relief, showing the seats to have been
constructed less for utilitarian than decorative purposes.
The carpet was a rich heavy cut pile of a strange pattern. In the
centre was a large circle, and in the centre of this ring a blush rose.
This attracted her attention, and º she could not in the least
understand the train of thought, she could not help, connecting this
rose somehow or another with the memory of her, to her, lost Joseph.
The door opened, and PIEL DoRNros., in an evening dress of the
height of fashion, with large white tie, high collars and tail coat that
swept the floor, entered, gaily.
“Do not approach me,” said Bessy, flying to the bell-rope.
“Nay, pretty flutterer,” said Pier, smailing, “ the bells will not
serve thee any more than will those they summon. They are dummies.”
“But your servants?” inquired Bess, sharply.
“I have none here but dumb-waiters,” was the cold * response.
“Come,” he continued, “enough of this prudery. Life was made
for love and pleasure; see where the banquet is prepared,” and drawing
aside a heavy drapery, he discovered to her astonished gaze a table
covered with a profusion of delicacies, including nuts from Brazil, and
oranges from sweet Seville, with bottles of the richest home-made wines
and ices, which could not have cost one penny less than that exact
sum. Then soft music began to play, and Piel watched its effect upon
her with evident satisfaction.
She permitted him to take her hand.
To lead her towards the banquet.
She trembled: soft aromatic vapours were wafted across the room,
and she sank upon a sofa, fetling that her will was becoming powerless
in the hands of this terrible being.
“Joseph " " she murmured.
“Bah!” exclaimed Piel. “Think not of him. He has neglected
you: he is toying at this moment with some lead-begrimed miner's
daughter.”
“Has he indeed sunk so low f" asked, in a subdued tone, Bess,
whose last remembrance of her lover was as he leapt from the burning
Lighthouse.
“He has,” replied Piel Dornton, feeling that the fewer words he
used the more powerful would be their force.
." So much beneath my level?” she continued more to herself than
“Sixteen thousand feet beneath the level of the sea,” returned
PIEL, gally. “Come, he is unworthy of you. To the banquet. Let us
drink his health.” So saying, he filled a jewelled goblet to the brim,
and as the beads sparkled and twinkled on the bosom of the wine of
Ginger, he cried aloud, “Joseph, to you I drink: gallant knight,
who would protect thy mistress haſ ha! Joseph, upon my word,
I should like to see you here !”
“You shALL!” exclaimed a voice. It came apparently from
The Blush Rose in the centre of the Carpet.

unseen force, Joseph stood before them.
DoRNTon discharged all his barrels at him as he rose, but with such

anything like certainty direct his aim.

And with this he drew from his boots the long coveted prize. PIEL
tore them open, and it was evident that he had immediately hit upon
an important discovery.
“ls this true P” he asked,
“It is P’’
“What?” asked Bess,
“No matter,” replied Joseph.
“Yes, it does matter,” answered PIEL, “I will tell her.

“He thought so,” explained Joseph. “And, do you know more

, Bess fainted.
; : I leave her in your hands,” said Piel, hastily.
* “Take her and be happy. There is a supper and excellent wine,
and gold pins for the crustacea. My work lies in another place.”
Joseph drew back from his proffered hand, and cursing the Miner's
pride, he strode from the room.
..When Bºssy revived he told her how he had been immured in a
mine in Cornwall, and how he had dug his way, wearing out his hands
and teeth for her, until he had found the subterranean route to her
present abode. -
Then he took a bath, and having discovered a rich suit of clothes, he
returned to her gaily.
When she heard that she was the daughter of LIEUTENANT MARCH-
Mont, she at once proposed to find him out, and join him and her
Slster.
“Or, if not,” she said to Joseph, “that bold bad man will marry
her, as he has already tried to marry me.”
“You are right: at any cost we will go.”
So these two set out upon their journey, and finding from inquiry at
the various coasts that Old MARTIN, who was very well known every-
where, had sailed away with a strange gentleman, (for LIEUTENANT
MARch Mont, from his long residence in Benicia, had been quite for-
gotten by the good inhabitants of the fishing villages), they took the
first steamer, leaving England, for CAPTAIN BounceR's course, which
he had declared before sailing to the look-out clerk, at the Storm
Signal Office. They sailed in haste, with all steam up, in the wake of
the good ship, Penelope Anne.
hile she was getting under weigh the partners in the bank of
CHECK, Diss, Count & Co., Benicia, were engaged on a scrutiny not
wholly unconnected with the present dramatis personae.
A strange Child, scarcely as tall as the money-shovel if upright,
called upon MR. SNAGG, the Chief Clerk.
MR. SNAGG was in bed, but as the Infant was importunate, the old
man-of-business deemed that, in the interest of his employers, he had
better see him.
The result of the interview was, that MR. SNAgg at once ran down
to the office and summoned the three partners.
. The four (the Child waiting anxiously without) commenced a rigid
inquiry into the title-deeds, contracts, and all law papers, bonds,
scrip, shares, and debentures held by their estimable client PIEL
DorintoN.
In an hour's time the Child was on his way to Phlebosco Palace, and
was standing before the LADY ANNA Domino, who was writing a letter.
He regarded her lovingly. “I don't like to hurt her, but he’s a villain
—he's a bad 'un., I will.”
This he said to himself, and then she turned and addressed him.
“You have seen my hus—. Your master P” she inquired.
“I have.”
“And he is—” -
“Don’t ask me,” said the poor boy, “I’ll do anything to save you—
I would, indeed, I would.”
And, he shouted and screamed, and laid hold of her dress, and
whined, and wriggled in his deep despair.
“You are the only cove who's ever been kind to me,” he said to
her. “And for your sake—.”
“Hush l’” she said, gently pushing him through a pane of glass into
the garden.
Then she thought for a few minutes. ... “The end must come,” she
said, presently, to herself. “Letit: take these packets to your master.”
The Child, who had returned, pulled a lock of his shaggy hair, and
quitted the house.
Immediatel , upon the doorstep, he was seized by a rough hand,

ERIN-GO-BRAY!
The great little Nightingale of Twickenham is said to have been
out when he sang—
“Earless, on high stood unabashed DEror."
Loss of ears, however, as well as the pillory, might have been in-
curred at one time for a political libel, and then both would doubtless
have befallen certain poor journalists, who, happily, can only be pil-
loried now, and that not bodily, but in print alone, represented by
specimens of their quality. Thus, two of them have stood in the
pillory of the Pall Mall Gazette, and that of the Times. Now also they
shall stand, just for fun, in Mr. Punch's pillory. MR. O'BLETHEREM-
skite, or whatever your name is, mount the stage of honour. Read
out of the Irishman some of your abuse of the Australian legislators
for passing a Treason-Felony Bill—just barring obscenity, if you please.
Hear, Mr. O'BLETHEREMs.Kite :-
“Out upon them, for a wretched selfish scum ; a shame and a hissing to the
name of manhood; a mock and a derision to the world; a hideous wen upon
creation; they had liberties and they lost them; they had a free Constitution and
they sacrificed 1t; they were all fetterless, and º put on the clanking fetters of
the felon slave, and branded themselves with a brand of immortal infamy.”
This rant would once have certainly cost O’BLEtherEMskite his
ears. In sentencing him to a barbarous but appropriate punishment,
a Judge of the period would perhaps have remarked that the culprit's
ears were much too long, and that cropping them, it was to be hoped,
would render him somewhat less an ass.
Now, MR. HowLAGAN, of the Nation, get up and expose yourself
MR. Howlagan believes that the next Mail from the far South will
probably bring “accounts of prosecutions, and fines, and imprison-
ments, and perhaps of rioting and bloodshed.” . As to the rioting and
bloodshed, MR. HowLAGAN's readers will mostly take his wish to be
the father to his belief. There he stands, then, with his hands and face
in a frame beside the other Fenian. Attention to How LAGAN :-
“In Sydney the suggestion sent from the Home Office has been taken up at
once, and even improved upon in its practical realisation. The rulers of that Colony
have set their gallows to work already, hanging upon it an Irishman of unsound
miud, who had fired a shot at PRINCE Alfred, and inflicted on him a wound from
which his Royal Highness recovered in a week. And they have rushed through
their Legislature, in the brief space of seven hours, a Treason Felony Bill, so wildly
and irrationally tyrannical in its provisions that not a vestige of public liberty can
be said to exist in the country where it is law.”
º MR. HowLAGAN! for thus supplying, a demand for treasonous
driveſ, in a former time you might have had not only to atone with
your ears, but also to pay through the nose. It might have been slit,
Sir, and cauterised, and your cheeks might have been branded with a
hot iron, and you might have been finally whipped some three or four
miles at the cart's §§ -
All that would have been cruel; but cropping, as a symbolical opera-
tion, would be as suitable for the ears of MR. How LAGAN as for MR. |
O’BLETHEREMskite's. Mr. HowLAGAN implicitly says that the inflic-
tion of a wound intended to be mortal, is rendered a trifling offence by
the circumstance that recovery from it takes place in a short time.
What else can he desire to be understood to say when he abuses the
Australian Government for hanging O'FARRELL because he had merely
“fired a shot at PRINCE ALFRED, and inflicted on him a wound from
which his Royal Highness recovered in a week” . This, too, is
how Howlagan speaks of a wound from a shot which glanced on a rib
close to the spine, and went half-way round the body In thus talking,
MR. HowLAGAN indeed proclaims Fenian sentiments; but rather dis-
plays a most superfluous longitude of ears.
Much too strong language would probably be used in calling HowL-
AGAN and O’BLETHEREMs.Kite malignant scoundrels. They may not be
malignant. Very likely Fenianism is but their brief, and, when they
rave, they are no more in earnest than a foul-mouthed barrister, who,
addressing a foolish jury, vents outrageous invective against anybody,
no matter whom, for a fee. -

Now we turn up our eyes and our noses at hazard,
And of Trente-et-Quarante and Roulette we fight shy,
Unless when of Homburg we’re ordered the waters,
Or at Baden stroll in for a coup on the sly.

Look at the article I’m appraising.
I just put 'em on, and then the eye
Discerns the folks who are going to buy.
There go the lot: sold, down in my book.
Put 'em on; you’re free
To stare at me.
Now then, do you think I’m as green as I look?
These spectacles are of a yellow hue,
Making everything golden ; that’s what they do.
Just look at a coal mine: black as ink,
It's the brightest gold colour wouldn’t you think?
Of course you would; and you’ll not be bested
Until in the shaft you have invested
Your old stocking full of yellow shiners
To pay the wage of the working miners.
You'll dig and not get, and bore and bore,
There's yellow to touch, could you dig any more;
But you can't ; for you’ve bored to the end of your purse,
As I have bored you to the end of my verse.
You'll never believe it, though you’ve been told?
You're a fellow

Go in for these Specs, they will realise gold.

So black, no parson could look much blacker.

And not see that rest is Heaven's own wages.

Here's some I can recommend—I can;

Look at anything through’em—short or tall,

Who think as these spectacle-wearers do.

I see who'll buy-there’s a College Don.
He won't : will none *
No: everyone
Like him, save a few, have got 'em on.
Now here's a pair for a right direction,
They’re called the Specs of Introspection.
I regret to say I’ve a great many pairs
On my hands at present; for whoever cares
To look into himself? why, I and you
Can do it when we’ve nothing better to do.

I don't think they’ll be of much use to him.
Now take 'em : but through 'em be it known
You'll see no one else's faults but your own.
You'll find enough for a life's correction—

CHARITY AND MUSIC.
a year, the clean, neat clothing which Charity bestows, should be
paraded at St. Paul's, and º inspected. The gathering of the
school children under º huge dome is a sight which never palls by
its yearly repetition. There is ever a fresh charm inseeing those fresh,
rosy, innocent young faces, all looking as plump, and clean, and
tº thy, as plenty of good food and good scrubbing can make them.
t is pleasant to see the costumes of a century ago, the white pelerines
and caps, dark frocks and yellow gloves reaching to the elbow, and the
pink, or green, or blue rosettes and ribbons worn for ornament. What
a snowstorm seems to come, when the girls all bury their faces in their
aprons as they say their prayers; ...i what a peal of tiny thunder
sºunds, as girls and boys stand up “with one consent” to sing, the
glorious “Old Hundredth.” The piercing, shrill young voices thrill
ou to the bone; and, “albeit unused to the melting mood,” you will
ardly avoid losing a tear or two while listening. The way in which
they sing does credit to their teachers, who must take enormous pains
to train them to keep time and tune so perfectly. Even in the chant-
ing the words were fairly audible; and, when each word is uttered by
some four thousand voices, unless they speak together with most
accurate exactness, no word can well be audible. Where all behaved
so well, it would be invidious to single out for praise; yet Mr. Punch
as he went out, could not help patting on the head the girls of good
Saint Mary-le-bone, who were throughout a pattern for composure and
propriety, and sat like statues through the sermon, which was certainly
protruded to receive his contribution, Mr. Punch could not, help
noticing that there were fewer sovereigns than sixpences and shillings
in it. Next year he hopes, sincerely, this may not be the case. With
Universal Suffrage looming in the future, it is more than ever needful
that Electors should be educated; and, as helping towards this end,
the Charity Schools of London deserve, and make good use of, all the
aid that can be given them.

ANOTHER TURN WITH HANDEL.
“HATs off, Gentlemen!—a Genius !” -
This, says Robert Schumann, was the way in which a friend of
his one evening, at a gathering of musicians, preluded a morceau by the
French composer, ChopIN.
But if one makes a bow before the elegance of CHOPIN, what ought
one to do before the majesty of HANDEL! An enthusiast like Schu-
MANN might doubtless recommend us to go down on our knees; but
Mr. Punch, who is more practical, would advise all Handel worship-
pers to go down next week to Sydenham.
There will then be heard the third three-yearly HANDEL FESTIVAL.
On, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the grandest, works he wrote
will be performed more grandly than he ever could have dreamed of
Imagine HANDEL seated at his little tinkling harpsichord, and com-
posing his sublime, and mighty, “Hallelujah/* What would have
been his ecstasy to hear it thundered forth by the army of musicians,

o one having sympathies that vibrate to fine music should lose a
chance of hearing HANDEL at the Crystal Palace. Some over-carping
critics, who are gifted with long ears, make moan over the building as
unfitted for good music, and, take, delight in pointing out acoustical
defects which ears less long than theirs perhaps might fail to notice.
Of such kind are the men who can't enjoy a puppet-show, because they
will keep continually looking at the wires. There are effects produced
at Sydenham which can nowhere else be heard, and which anybody
having any real taste for music must cherish as a memory to be a joy
for ever, Many a grand solo may elsewhere be better audible, no
doubt; but where can a grand chorus be ever heard more grandly f
Moreover, people often are dissatisfied by what is their own fault, and,
having been too stingy to pay for a good place, they grumble at not
hearing well when seated in a bad one.
It was said of some one that “to know her was a liberal education;"
and, it may be said that “to know HANDEL is a religious education.”
If there be sermons in stones, there are sermons in tones also. No-
Jº
body, who listens to it reverently, can hear an oratorio of HANDel's
without being made the better for it. Could PALEY but have heard
the glorious “Messiah,” as worthilyº: as it will be next week,
he would have cited it among his Evidences of the Truth of Christi:
anity. The prophecies and gospels upon which the work is founded
must infallibly be true, or they could never have inspired such true,
soul-elevating music.

ave not much more to say on the subject, until question arises how
the man who saved Jamaica is to be compensated for what he has
undergone in consequence. But, law and society having given final
judgment, baffled spite continues to rage, and the inferior agents of the
Committee declare that they are now "unmuzzled.” The word is their
own, and it is singularly applicable. The muzzle being off, howl and

ably they will pass unnoticed, but it may not be altogether unjusti-
fiable to remark that where a muzzle hangs up, another article available
for canine education, as well as for winning Nemean games, is gene-

MY DEAR MR. PUNch,
I would not be so forward as to dare write to you, did I not
feel sure you have a dear, kind heart. The truth is, I am married to
a gentleman, who, unfortunately for both of us, is a Clerk in the Cus-
toms. Well, when you yourself, and lots of influential papers and
things said justice should be done to the Customs, Guss and I got
quite hopeful, and together, we formed all sorts of nice prospective
schemes, such as sending John NY and CLARA to good schools, and
getting a little way out of town ourselves, which I’m sure you don't
think extravagant notions, do you? Of late, however, to my utter
dismay, Guss gets moody, and murmurs something about, “the ques-
tion being shelved,” and “afraid the Government will drop it.”
Now, dear Mr. Punch, please don't let them. Guss tells me MR.
DiskAELI is the great man in the Government; and,of course, you
know him. Do speak to him, please. I feel certain if I could only
see MRs. DISRAELI, and, talk to her, she would make her husband
do something for as , but there is no chance of my seeing her.
I hope you will forgive me for bothering you, but I assure you it is
very serious for us; but I’m quite sure you’ll help us.
Believe me, Dear Mr. Punch, ever gratefully Yours,
Lucy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN UNIMAGINABLE conversATION.
Some—St. James's Park. Hour—Just before the House met after
- Whitsunfide.
Mr. Disraeli. My dear GLADstone. how are you ?
Mr. Gladstone. And you, my dear DisrAell P -
Mr. Dis. Holidays are good things, and about the only good things
: which one can't have too much. However, here goes the school
ell again.
ºa. Calling in the educated, and the Educator? .
Mr. Dis. Yes. I'm tired, though, of teaching, the old idea how to
shoot—Niagara. What will you give for the good-will of the business *
Mr. Glad. Is there any good will ? -
Mr. Dis. Don't be uncharitable, but that’s always the way with
you pious men. And, by the way, talking to a brother author, why do
you go writing in goody-goody magazines, and getting your theology
overhauled * Why don't you write a nove
Mr. Glad I don't know that I could.
Mr. Dis. Every man can do what he is resolved to do. But you are
as above false modesty as—
Mr. Glad. As a friend of mine is above tºwe, -- -
Mr. Dis. You flatter me, and I wish you'd do it in the House. But
with your impulsive nature, ingenuity, and wealth of language, you
would write the best novel going. should tremble for the lady to
whom your hero made love.
Mr. Glad. He would make no love that ought to be trembled at, you
may be sure of that. - - -
Mr. Dis. Highly proper, I’m sure. Well, turn it over in your mind,
as you’ll have plenty of time for three volumes before you get back to
Downing Street. -
Mr. Glad. Perhaps.
Mr. Dis Nay, who should know if I do not * -
Mr. Glad Just so. And suppose, we exchange literary, recommen-
dations. Surely you will prepare a Memºir ºf your Administration?
Mr. Dis. I am not vain. I can afford to have an episode in my life
forgotten. In fact, I might prefer it. ---
Mr. Glad. I can understand * preference, but not the probability.
Mr. Dis. Well, I am in the hands of my friends, and other enemies.
I dare say that biography will be very frank when I have done with
patronage. Is that SALisbury going by ?
Mr. Glad. Why don't you take a peerage and meet him again?
Mr. Dis. In another and a better place " No, I think I'll wait.
Besides, how could l bear the parting with you?
Mr. Glad. Self-sacrifice is a duty in this world.
Mr. Dis. I have read so. But I prefer sacrificing other people. And
you cannot say that I have not offered up my hecatomb.
Mr. Glad. A hundred oxen—a happily chosen word for your bucolic
followers.
Mr. Dis. It is an effective trisyllable, only smart writers are in such a
hurry to explain one's good things. Well, my dear successor, you
expect a long innings?
Mr. Glad. I do not know. I cannot tell what to expect. But if we
get an innings for ten years, you know whose fault it will be. If you
had taken our moderate Bill, you would have had all the legitimate
chances of the chapter of accidents. Now, I must own, at any risk of
being rude, that I do not seem to see you on the SPEAKER's right
again in a hurry.
Mr. Dis. I have waited through worse discouragements. Years ago
I had to declare that I belonged to a party that never would rise again.
Mr. Glad. And did it *
Mr. Dis. Well put in. Why, we are in office.
Mr. Glad. We, the protectionists over whom you made elegy
Mr. Dis. “Those, Sir — or others,” as Sir Amorous Lafoole says.
What a capital play is that Epicene A. The mock divorce—lawyers draw
distinctions as finely as you could, though not in such beautiful Latin.
Mr. Glad. No. And the masterly surprise when the old party finds
that a mild conservative lady turns out a violent and voluble reformer
of the house— -
Mr. Dis. Ha! haſ Let us have some private theatricals at Christ-
mas, and do that play. SALISBURY shall be Morose.
Mr. Glad. And you shall be forgiving, and present him with the
Garter, and say, “Answer me not but with thy leg, Morose.”
Mr. Dis. Will I ? For trying to jerk the Ribbons out of my hands
But other people have their Salishuries. How do you like your super-
natural Bishop, you Dragon of Wantley that eats churches, and calls
himself ºft Churchman.
Mr Glad. The Bishop of SALisbury is a very good man, and may
not be the only person in England who thinks that he can work
miracles I should imagine that it might be your own belief.
Mr. Dis. Iſ Not at all. My feats are purely chemical.
Mr. Glad Performed by treating principles as drugs. -
Mr. Dis. One to you. . But bide a wee, as we say in my favourite
country. Your Birmingham pounder is a Harmonious Blacksmith, but
I fail to see that he has welded your party very tightly. You may have
to study elective—and electoral—affinities yet. Have you got an
English anti-Church Bill ready?
Mr. Glad. Come—nobody hears us.
Mr. Dis True, and my watch is fast, which is to be deplored. But
you’ll have to do it.
Mr. Glad. I thought that we were talking in the green-room, but if
you will get back upon the stage—
Mr. Dis. Never was more in earnest in my life. -
Mr. Glad. Occasionally, I fancy. And you will be a good deal more
in earnest when a certain vote comes.
Mr. Dis. Is it certain f
Mr. Glad As far as anything human can be.
Mr. Dis. Taat would be inhuman... But—this is a free country, and
when one is at an auction one may bid as high as one likes. Suppase
I outbid you, and offer a dozen bishops for twelvemonths’ cº I
think it would be knocked down to me. If so, will you go in for a
knock-out, afterwards—you know what that is—and share the spoil
Mr. Glad Hardly, if I have the power to fix the reserved price.
Mr. Dis. Very well-don't say I did not offer to do business with
you... We might make a capital Cabinet between us, and defy all ..
world. Who would, dare to show fight, with you to point out his
crimes and me his follies -
Mr. Glad. Some men are vain enough to think themselves neither
criminal nor foolish. And I may tell you that I think another Parlia-
ment than this may go in for Seriousness.
Mr. Dis. What, in the sense of the housemaid who advertises for a
serious family
Mr Glad. I did not mean that in the first instance, but we may
come to that in time.
Mr. Dis. Bajght is a Quaker-Beales is º write psalms
and hymns and spiritual songs–BRADLAUGH has his º:
would abolish drink—you have put a motion into my head. -
Mr. Glad, I may put one or two more there he fore l have done.

there is a door-yea, a great aud a wide door-yea, and a door
that º easily upon the hinge, as it were a hinge that hath been
oiled with the oil of the fish, even the great fish which is carnally

Mr. Glad. He is not a fish, and you are, and an odd one. What is that

Mr. Dis, Truly and verily thou hast hit it, brother WILLIAM, and
the root of the matter is in thee, and there is joy and rejoicing, yea,
and blowing of trumpets, and sounding of psalteries and dulcimers
over thee, and thou shalt live, and not die. Be one with me, my
brother, and we will eat the fat of the land.
Mr. Glad. I hate fat.
Mr. Dis. Nay, but cast in thy lot with me, and we will be like unto
the worthy brother_SPRATT, whose name is John, and the comely
vessel his wife, and I will eat the fat and thou shalt eat the lean, for I
say unto thee that a good time is at hand. My dear GLADs tone, I will

Mr. Glad. By Jovel, Thor forgive me ! But what in Gehenna—you

BRowN AND GREEN.
Green. By Jove, it is too bad |
Brown. What is too bad
Green. Well; one doesn't care much about foreign Affairs in general,
but can’t help feeling shocked at the way in which the CzAR is treat-
ing the Poles.
Brown. What about it *
Green. He has abolished their separate administration—the whole
country is now ruled by the Russian Home Office.
Brown. Indeed
Green. He has proscribed their language in all Government matters;
they can’t even present a petition in their native tongue.
Brown. Really *
Green. He has forbidden it to be taught in their schools.
Brown. You don’t say so ! - -
Green. He is trying to destroy their religion by bribery;
converts to the Greek Church; closing the Roman Catholic Č
by military force. -
Brown. Well, to be sure.
Green. He is confiscating their landed property, and giving it away
to Russian local officials. One hundred and sixty-seven estates have
been already distributed amongst those brutes to reward them for zeal
in doing their dirty work of carrying out his plans of oppression. This
is your mild and humane EMPEROR OF Russia
Brown. Whence did you derive all this information ?
Green. From the Post.
Brown. And you believe it
Green. Yes, I do.
Brown. Do you—then I don't.
Green. Why? What reason have you to doubt it
Brown. The best in the world.
Green. May I know what that is
Brown. This. The EMPERoR of Russia is much too enlightened
and much too well advised to defy the public opinion of Europe by the
monstrous acts that you have mentioned. What, when England dares
no longer maintain the sentimental grievance of an Irish Protestant
Church, do you suppose the Russian Sovereign would venture to do
anything whatever displeasing to his Roman Catholic subjects * The
idea that he would dream of attempting to destroy their religion | Oh,
ho, ho! excuse me—but it is too absurd.
Green. Well ; it does seem so certainly.
Brown. Besides, isn’t there a Reform League in Russia with its
head-quarters at St. Petersburg, with a President who is just such
another man as MR. BEALEs (M.A.), and other leaders like MR, ODGER
buying
hurches
WOL. Ll W. C
and MR. Lucraft and Colonel Dickson 2 And isn’t there a Working-
Men's Association directed by a Chief who corresponds exactly to
MR. Potter P
Green. I have not heard so.
Brown. No; very likely. You never heard of their parading the
streets in menacing processions and destroying public property. They
have no occasion ever to do anything of the kind.
Green. How is that P
Brown. Oh! the Russian Government always saves them the trouble,
by executing their orders. When they want to dictate the policy of
the Empire they have only to wait on the Minister of the Interior and
inform him of the resolutions which they have voted at a public-house.
Green. Well now, all this is really quite new to me.
Brown. Oh! you don’t know what progress liberal ideas have made
on the Continent. Alexander is even more advanced than Louis
Napoleon. But then these great progressive rulers have enemies,
who propagate reports about them which are precisely the reverse of
true. For instance, what the EMPERoR of Russia has really been
doing in Poland is this. He has established Imperial Colleges for
educating the people irrespectively of creed, and in each of these there
is a Professor of Polish literature. He is now at work about a mea-
sure for securing tenant right in respect to the improvement of land,
and he is engaged in maturing a scheme for the disestablishment and
disendowment of the Greek Church.
Green. You surprise me, indeed.
Brown. I dare say. But mind. It is doubtful if he would try to
conciliate Poland so much as he does if it were not for his respect for
public opinion as expressed by the Russian Reform League º:
through its Beales. His Imperial Majesty is also said to be very
much influenced by the eloquence of another Tribune of the Russian
People. I believe his name is BRIGHTHOFF.
(Conversation closes.)
NOT FOR ENGLAND !
The subjoined telegram from St. Petersburg, indicates a degree of
coolness, if not of simplicity:-
“The Russian Government has addressed a communication to several foreign
Governments, proposing the prohibition by treaty of the use of explosive pro-
jectiles in war, or the limitation of such projectiles to submarine torpedoes."
Oh, yes! No doubt it would be very convenient for Russia if the
use of explosive projectiles in war could be limited to submarine tor-
pedoes; for, as a torpedo is not a projectile, that would amount to
their total disuse. How jolly to be enabled to sweep the seas in her own
Ironclads safe from shells, and at the same time keep Cronstadt clear
of the enemy’s with torpedoes! Does the Russian Government see
any of the peculiar tint of the waves in the eyes of the maritime powers ?

“NONE BUT THE BRAVE,” &c.
A SKETCH IN BROMPTON |
SOUTHERN EMANCIPATION.
THE Saturday Review says, touching one of the resolutions lately
voted by the Chicago Convention:-
“A declaration of sympathy for peoples struggling for their rights is virtually
addressed to Ireland, unless Crete is included for the purpose of placing Turkey in
the same category with England.”
Some of our other contemporaries have further suggested that this
resolution was meant to catch the Irish vote for GENERAL GRANT. To
suppose that it relates to Ireland and the Irish in any degree, what a
strange º Why, Ireland is not struggling at all." The
American Irish Fenians, indeed, tried to make Ireland struggle for a
Republic; but they failed. Ireland is an integral part of the United
Kingdom. Corresponding union has still to be re-established in the
United States. In America, at least, Liberality, like, Charity, begins
at home. When the Chicago Convention declared its sympathy for
peoples struggling for their rights, the Southerners, held under by
military force, were, of course, the people that it was particularly
thinking of.
THE DISCOUNTER DISHED.
A MILITARY correspondent of the Times, “LEFT HAND,” suggests an
expedient for sickening usurers of sending gentlemen in the Army
circulars offering to lend them money. He advises officers “simply to
return all such circulars in unstamped envelopes.” Good. But he
adds :-"If these bear the regimental device so much the better, as it
will give a good hint that no more need be sent to that corps.” Well,
too; only let the regimental device be stamped inside the envelope
containing the circular. Then it will never defeat the end of returning
that communication unstamped. . But, if the envelope bear it outside,
then the regimental device will, after Shylock has once paid twopence
for his returned circular, prove a device for warning him not to be so
caught again. He will bº enabled to avoid being taken in a second
time, by refusing to take in the letter; and, moreover, Shylock, havin
ºnce been sold by a letter bearing a regimental stamp, will, from ºi
fellow-feeling, caution his friend Tubal to beware of being done likewise,

THE ONE THING I COULD MAKE.
THERE was a time when I,
Though I could, no more than fly,
Make a statue with my uttermost endeavour;
At the least could build a ship,
And in that point did outstrip,
As I thought, all other people whomsoever.
But, adzooks, where am I now,
When so many rivals plough
All around, on every side, the field of ocean P
en of war must all wear mail—
And do mine excel, or fail,
For defence, or for attack, or locomotion ?
I’m afraid I mustn't brag—
I have strong ships, but they lag—
I have fast ones, but they roll so in rough weather,
That their naked hulls they show
To the broadside of the foe—
Couldn't fire a shot—big blunders altogether.
Has it come to this, afloat,
That I’ve scarcely a gun-boat,
But she’s either a mere tub, or else a roller?

That confounded Chief Constructor and Comptroller.

A NEW INVENTION.
IN nine cases out of ten a visit to a coiffeur may be considered one
of those minor annoyances which human flesh is hair to. We believe
there are º: who like to have their locks cut, as there are eels who
enjoy being skinned; but it is a peculiar taste, to say the least of it, and
for our part we look upon the operation as we do upon a thunderstorm,
or the measles, as a “thing well over.” Therefore, do we welcome
the intelligence that there is to be a new machine shortly introduced
for the mechanical cutting of hair. The hard breathing and the clammy
finger of the operator are to be dispensed with, and we are to resign
our head to the tender mercy of a machine which is warranted not to
express any opinion as to the weather, by no means to make offensive
observations about “thinning at the top,” and under no circumstances
whatever to pester us with pots of Astrachan shaving paste, or Patent
Patagonian Pomade.
Whether the inventor, who is a Frenchman, will be able to adapt
this ingenious contrivance to English heads is a question—hair-cutting
from the foreigner's point of view being a process closely resemblin
the peeling of turnips. The machine may not º: so successful wit

A MEETING LIRE THIS.
LocKED in each other's arms stood the Lieutenant and GRACE.
She had been introduced to her father, Old MARTIN, but preferred
her uncle.
“ Fie, GRACE ' " said the Lieutenant.
a"; Lieutenant wanted to know who that gentleman was in the
lstance.
“My preserver !” she exclaimed rapturously, and told them what
an amusing and instructive companion NUTT was, and how she'd
never enjoyed herself so much anywhere as on this island.
NuTT came up smiling, bashfully.
“This ' ' ' exclaimed the Lieutenant. “What do you mean, GRACE?
This is the Boomerang !!”
Through all his change he saw it—the Boomerang.
‘. Once, I was,” NUTT replied, bearing himself erectly, and showing
off his dress clothes to the greatest possible advantage.
“ Not now.”
“A servant!” exclaimed the Lieutenant.
“A kind one,” answered GRACE, extending her hand.
NIITT worshipped her now, and the tears rose to his eyes.
: Take her,” said the Lieutenant, “and marry her.”
: My consent is wanted,” interrupted her father, Old MARMADUKE.
“Stop!” said GRACE. “I am another's—PIE1, DoRNToN’s.”
“True,” was the Lieutenant's answer. “The contract was signed
on that fatal night.”
“MR. MARMADUKE, Lieutenant, and Miss GRACE,” began NUTT
much moved.
“Hear!, hear!” said CoMMANDER BounceR, who had not been in-
j
cluded in the opening part of the address. Nutt rectified the omission
and proceeded.
“Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I am bound to say,+
ahem—that this is the unhappiest, though the proudest, moment of my

RACE.
She received him confusedly. Then he confronted NUTT.
Suddenly the blood left his cheeks and he would have fallen, but for
Old MARTIN, who fell instead, and hurt himself. - -
“Hear him,” cried the Commander, with true English love of fair
play, and some curiosity as to the rest of NUTT's speech.
“Lady and Gentlemen,” he recommenced, “let me tell you my story,
I was brought up at an infant school, and subsequently, being a boy of
studious habits, was apprenticed to a lecturer at the Polytechnic. Here
I acquired that scientific knowledge, which to have learnt has made me su-
premely happy, seeing that it has alleviated the miseries of one for whom
I entertain eelings of the most profound admiration and the deepest
love.” He bowed to GRACE º proceeded. She felt he had never,
even when dressed to catch the geese and wild fowl—never, never,
looked so beautiful as now, -
“It was here, too, I mean at the Polytechnic, l, mastered that
clear and lucid style in which it has been my highest endeavour to
explain to #" the wonders of nature, and the marvels, during our
evenings, of the microscope. So well have we employed, our hours
here,” he turned to GRACE for corroboration, who said “yes,”, and
begged him to go on—“That we have run through the entire cycle of
Polytechnic lectures, including the dissolving views, which we really
managed admirably, the drop of Thames water with the living, crea:
tures in it, the exposition of spiritualism, the automaton Leotard, and
many other useful and entertaining experiments, including glass-blow-
ing for the tails of peacocks and imitation candles which won't light,

George under water when your arrival interfered with our settled plan,
Excuse me—to return. I quitted the Polytechnic to join a distinguished
aéronaut—” - -
“I know you now,” exclaimed DoRNTon... “This fellow,” he said,

“You thought so, perhaps, Piel DoRNton,” was NUTT's calm reply,
which seemed to crush the other into the earth., “When you threw
my companion and myself out of the balloon into the sea. You thought
so, no, doubt, when you seized the deeds and papers with which my
unhappy companion was indeed escaping from the hands of justice. He

“Hear, hear !” said CoMMANDER BounceR. -
—" He is no more. My aeronautic friend started his balloon from
a public garden. Here it was hired by a private party. That Private
Party was the Fraudulent Solicitor; I was told off to attend him. He
arrived with his deeds and boxes. His pistol was constantly at my
ear, and I was obliged to give up all chance of escape and leave him,
the balloon, and myself to a merciful fate—with my eye, however,
always on the parachute. From above I saw this man give his wretched
father the fatal blow in the Cavern by the Sea—””
“It’s a lie l’” shrieked PIEL DoRNTON. - -
“It is truth, as I stand here,” returned NUTT. “He climbed in by
our grapnel when we were almost aground, and repaid our hospitality
with another crime.”
“The name of the Solicitor?” asked Old MARTIN, eagerly.
“SMITH,” was NUTT's answer.
Old MARTIN turned to his brother, LEONARD CHARLEs.

So excited was every one that they had not noticed the approach of
two separate boats, whose occupants now stood forward.

the Detective, holding the Infant, and SNAgg, the clerk, steering.
In the second, Bessy with Joseph and the papers, sailing. . .
GRIPP spoke. “These papers, signed Smith, were placed in the

NUTT was of immense use here, owing to his having spent so much
time in a balloon with a solicitor.
He pointed out the habendum clause, and explained all the flaws
and the dealings with the various technicalities and difficulties, and
when these were removed, it was as clear as daylight that GRAcE
MARCHMONT must henceforth bear the title of BARQNess BIsMUTH,

JOKES I MIGHT HAVE MADE.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,
IT is a hard thing, you will admit, to be a victim to circum-
stances. When we look around us, and behold the numerous list of
sufferers of this sort, from milliners to malefactors, the first being
slaves to a kaleidoscopical creature termed Fashion, who never knows
its own mind, the latter martyrs to a squeamish sentiment of Society,
which insists on punishing the unhappy felon; how lengthy is the
list of the victims to circumstances, one cannot help remarking, Sir,
that it is a hard thing.
Stay, though, I have said “one” cannot help remarking, &c. Yes,
Sir, “one” can. That particular one am I, for I, have not been a
victim to circumstances—I have been a victim to the absence of cir-
cumstances. . With me things never happen—nothing ever takes place.
I am crushed by an entire absence of everything; that is, everything
which would enable me to score in the conversational cricket-match.
Nobody ever gives me a chance; nothing is ever said calculated to
F. an exhibition of my peculiar talent—my very peculiar talent.
am a wit, Sir ; I am indeed : my best friends would not believe me,
for I never make a joke—aloud. To myself I make many. Indeed, at
times I am quite ill from the plethora of puns, the surfeit of smart
jokes and ridiculous riddles which, if I were permitted to make public,
would, 1 am convinced, convulse the world at large. I think, Sir, you
will admit that if Prince Hal didn't play up to Falstaff, the fat knight's
fun would fall a little flat: Cor would beliterally “shut up” without
his Bor, and no conundrum would answer without its corresponding
}. Very good. Then why won't people give me an opportunity?
ask for nothing more.
The day after the Derby, for instance; I was dining with Jones.
Conversation turned upon the race—odd, but it did. The noble owner
of Lady Elizabeth was sympathised with, and the unwillingness of the
animal to start was descanted on. Somebody asked the name of the
|Jockey, and here 1 could have fired off a double-barrelled shot with
great effect, if—ah, that “if”—I say, if I had had an assistant. But,
| Sir, like the Northern States and HERR FRIKELL, I will never stoop to
confederacy. No ; but if anybody had asked what would have been a
good name for the Marquis's Jockey (which no one did) I could have
replied unhesitatingly,–Money. Because, you see, the owner could
have put his money on the animal, and as is well known money makes
the mare to go. This I think would have produced its effect; but
from the cause I have mentioned, it did not. I have noticed that good
things, when left out of a piece, seldom go for much.
I was at the Adelphi the other night, and a really brilliant joke was
lost from the fact of no one making the following remark. I must
premise that the drama being performed was No Thoroughfare, and
that a very spooney-looking young man in a private box was evidently
terribly smitten with the charming actress who played Marguerite.
Now it only required some one to ask, “What is the difference between
a gold-digger and the spooney-looking young man P” for me (on the spur
of the moment) to have replied, the former goes to seek a lot o' money,
and the latter goes to see CARLotta Leclercq. ... But the people
about me would have perished in their seats rather than have assisted
me in any way.
In the course, Sir, of a long literary career you may possibly have
met with the remark that—
“Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.”
That, Sir, is my case. I could really bloom forth in public splendour
and achieve a wide celebrity, would, surrounding circumstances only
occasionally resolve themselves into what the man in the play describes
as “a concatenation accordingly.” The diner-out who says funny
things is a person generally in considerable request; now I venture to
suggest that any individual who would devote his time to assisting the
funny man, who would with tact, delicacy, and a happy appreciation of
the right moment at which to say the right thing, lead up as it were
to the prandial wit, would be literally worth his weight in gold. Here
is a great opening for the charitable. There are crowds of diners-out
who are dummies. Let them devote themselves to this noble work.
They will be welcomed cordially by such sufferers as myself.

A ROW IN A COURT.
AIR-Popular Hornpipe.
In the House of Commons, now,
Very often there’s a row ; -
While the Ermine keeps its gravity,
. And dignity and suavity:
So a rumpus in the higher Courts of Law is very rare.
But a shindy, in the Court
. Qf Queen's Bench, has given sport;
Twas occasioned by Judge BLACKBURN in the case of MR. EYEE.
JUSTICE BLACKBURN did preside
When that EYRE was to be tried,
And a charge to the Grand Jury gave,
- A just one, to be sure, he gave,
But he said the other Judges his opinion all did share.
So the Bill was thrown right out,
"Mid a universal shout
Of “ Hurrah for the Preserver of Jamaica, MR, EYRE!”
When the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE read
What his colleague then had said,
Says he, “I don't agree with it,
- So let no one credit me with it;
In particular I think that GoRDON's trial was unfair,
If that charge I had foreknown,
Then another of º own.
I would surely have delivered in the case of MR. EYRE.”
Then my lord pulled off his wig,
If the scene was infra dig,
Yet how charming is variety,
- Though from general ºf; !
And a wig in summer weather is an awful thing to wear.
Slap, he shied it at the head
Of the puisne Judge, and said,
– “Now take that for what I think about the case of MR. EYRE | *
}: for wig then BLACKBURN threw,
And flung back the other's too.
There ensued, with reciprocity
Of mutual ferocity, - - - - -
Such a wigging, that it might have made blind justice even stareſ
But when judges disagree
How decide, good folks, shall we?
How shall Governors determine in the place of MR. EYRE *
A WARNING TO THE MAN IN THE MOON.
.THE end of bribery and corruption is within sight, at no, great
distance. Members of the House of Commons are threatened by the
Registration Bill with loss of their autumnal holidays. All work, and
no play will make the parliamentary Jack a still duller boy than he is
already. As it is, the duties of a Member of Parliament are very
laborious; and if, as seems likely, they become much, or, indeed, only
a little more so, they will amount to a bore of greater magnitude than
even the calamitous office of a Juryman, . It will be necessary to
impress men for public service in the Legislature just as it is to compel
them to serve on juries. Instead of seeking to be the representative
of a county or a borough at the price of an enormous expenditure, a
gentleman will have to be forced to accept election by the alternative
of a heavy fine. Or else it will come to . that, so far from getting
paid anything whatever, electors will be obliged to pay the man of their
choice very handsomely indeed in order to induce anyone to come
forward as a candidate for the employment of representing them.
Canada and Capetown.
THE Weekly Dispatch announces that:-
“Bishop Lynch is to be the new Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canada."
The Bishop is not supposed to be any relation to his namesake the
Judge; nor are the Canadian Roman Catholics thought likely, to be
subjected to ecclesiastical Lynch law; such as certain English divines
want to enforce at Natal.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Punch's Essence of PARLIAMENT.
Mox DAY, June 8. Government intimated that it was burning and
raging to get business over, and to come to the General Election, and
the Vote of Confidence; but that, inasmuch as it would require “fine
steering” to bring the New Parliament together before Christmas, and
as there would certainly be no time then to discuss money matters, a
Year's Supplies would now be asked., The House was to have a week
to consider this proposal. Except that the present state of things is
utterly unconstitutional, there is no particular objection. .. -
We took the Scotch Reform Bili in Committee, and polished it off.
Glasgow is to have the Three-Cornered Wote, which LoRD, DERby and
MR. BRIGHT think so wrong, and which MR. MILL thinks so right.
It is sad that the Member for Westminster's logical powers are so
feeble, that he cannot perceive that ninety-nine men of education ought
to submit in silence and humility to be reduced to political nonentity
by one hundred non-educated persons; but so it is. -
The Scotch get their 7 New Members; and the 7 English Boroughs,
which it was finally agreed to sacrifice to Caledonia (stern and wild),
are—
Arundel of the Owls.
Ashburton of the Quarterly GIFford. ,
Dartmouth of the Gunpowder.
Honiton of the Laces.
Lyme Regis of the Cobb.
Thetford of the Black Church.
Wells of the Cathedral.
Battle over the Boundaries Bill, and whether the Commissioners
who took so much pains over the arrangements, or the Committee,
which had political considerations before it, should be supported.
Much sharp language, MR. BRIGHT wrathful, and MR. Osborne com-
limenting the House on self-stultification. We went at it again on
hursday, and were still more sarcastic upon one another. M.R. HiB-
BERT fought for the Committee, MR. ADDERLEY attacked MR.
BRIGHT, who warned the Conservatives that Numbers would one of
these days avenge any attempt to ignore them, LoRD GALWAY called
MR. Osborn E a Buffoon, and the latter neatly
“Order” being raised—“O, he is quite in order.”. Finally, MR. HIB.
BERT's Resolution was carried by 184 to 148, against Ministers, who,
however declined to regard the matter as one of vital importance, a
sweet and pleasing line of conduct to which they have nobly adhered
upon several occasions, which might have disturbed ordinary souls.
The public may like to be reminded–
“These must be taught, as if you taught them not,
And things unknown proposed as things forgot—”
to be reminded, we say, of the little history of this matter. Boun-
daries for voting purposes being wanted, an Act of Parliament was
obtained, and under it a couple of Commissioners (a barrister and an
officer of “the educated Service,”) were sent over the country. All
these Commissioners studied the subject on the spots, examined wit-
nesses, and reported. There were people who did not like the pro-
posed changes, and they made such a row, that a Select Committee
of the Commons was appointed to consider the Report. They upset
nearly all that the barristers and officers had done, and now the vote
which we have described confirms the upset.
we legislators, MRs. GRUNDy, eh, M’m We need hardly say that
the farce cost nothing, as barristers and engineers are always ready
to go everywhere and do all sorts of work for nothing, and pay their
own hotel bills.
Tuesday. A morning sitting on the Bill for Handing over the Tele-
phs to Government. The subject, which afforded material for a
ne and suggestive speech, was rather barrenly treated by MR. WARD
HUNT; but he explained the Bill, and thought that it ought to be at
once read and sent to a Select Committee. It was opposed by MR.
LEEMAN for the Companies, who of course only want to extort the
uttermost farthing from the Nation, and he introduced the usual cant
about Government's reading our messages, and being, averse to im:
provements in electrical science. As we let them read our letters if
they like, the first objection is not much, and as for the second it was
rather Cheeky, considering that the Companies never introduce any
improvements, that our Telegrams are the worst in Europe, and that
even the common convenience of having the message printed, as has
been done in America for twenty years, is not adopted here, but the
messages are transcribed by blundering clerks, who send frantic
nonsense...Mr. Punch's, whole domestic arrangements were nearly
plunged into despair and dismay by reason of Judy's opening a telegram
of mere business, but which the ass of a clerk had converted into a
summons from a Lady. From that moment he vowed extinction to the
Companies, and HE will KEEP HIs Wow,
...For the time the Bill stood over, MR. GLADSTONE and the 9;
sition approve the plan, but think that more inquiry is needful—that
* to tº: they prefer that the Boon should proceed from the next

retorted—a cry of
We are practical people, ||
Ascot Races began to-day, and the House was Counted Out at night.
It was...very pleasant on Ascot Heath this Tuesday, the attendance
being distinguished rather than enormous. Our darling PRINCEss was
in green, and Mr. Punch wore, by instinct, a green cravat.
Wednesday. Woman, in her capacity of ill-treated Wife, was the
theme of this day. The Bill for the Protection of the . y of
Married Women was taken in hand. The usual talk followed. One
side, harped upon the marriage vow, and the duty of submission and
obedience, and the revolutionary character of those who would encou-
rage a wife to be independent, and the hard and cruel nature of some
wives, and LoRD GALWAY said that the words in the service must be
altered, and instead of “love, honour, and obey;” the lady ought to
say “enter into a partnership on equal terms.” fhe other side showed
that woman was unfairly treated, and that in her case matrimony was
made a crime, for her property was instantly taken away. Rich
girls had settlements, but poor girls had no such protection against
brutal husbands. On division, there was a Matrimonial Tie, each side
mustering 123, so the SPEAKER, in accordance with rule, voted in the
affirmative, that is, for the women, in order to give the House another
opportunity of considering the subject.
The ies in the “Cage” above the reporters, made all sorts of
disturbances during the debate, such as murmuring, hissing, clapping
hands, and rattling fans against the brass. Mr. Punch thinks, º: all
submission, that they had better confine such demonstrations to the
theatre. There, nobody, except the unfortunate actors whose points
are lost, and the general public who pay to hear the play, complain
that the private boxes are noisy, and that the chatter of ladies who
have dined, and swells who have had something after dinner, disturbs
the performances. They must not bring their box manners into the
gallery of the House.
Thursday was the Cup, Day at Ascot. It was very pleasant on
Ascot Heath this Thursday, the attendance being enormous rather
than distinguished. The horses who had been the first three in the
Derby alone ran for the Cup, and Bluegown won, .." being before
King Alfred, instead of behind that monarch, who on this occasion
burned the cakes. Our darling PRINcess was in pink, and Mr. Punch
. by instinct, a cravat #: might have been pink, only it was
ue. º
MR, HARDY brought in a Bill for expediting the Registration of the
new electors. The revision of the lists, is to begin in September, with
an enlarged staff of lawyers, and the roll is to be complete and printed
by the 1st of October. The elections are to follow, with a somewhat
shorter time than usual for the return of the writs. The idea is to get
Parliament together in time to have the Big Battle fought about the
14th of December. This will greatly conduce to the harmony, peace,
and goodwill which should prevail at Christmas.
Friday. The Lords, like Mr. Punch, had found it too hot to attend
to much business early in the week, but also, like him, they woke up
this evening, and did a capital º On the motion of LonD CLAN-
RICARDE, they sent to a Select Committee (in this case all but a
sentence of death) the Bill for effectuating the Conspiracy by which, as
LoRD REDEspale said, the three Southern Railways propose to extort
more money from the Public for worse service." The way that several
Lords fired into this attempt at Fraud, was pleasing; and it may be
that the Railway Interest “elsewhere” might have winced at the
anguage in which their devices were described. The Commons had
showed themselves subservient to that interest, and afraid to help the
º ; the Lords stood up like the Barons of old, and claimed the
eople's lawful right to travel well at a fair charge. To be sure it cost
their Lordships nothing but attendance in their places; but we can’t
ways get them to give even that.
Discussion on a proposal to remove such restrictions on the publi-
cation of Newspapers, as the giving security. MR. MILL thought that
it was like making physicians give security not to poison, merely
because some quacks poisoned. The week finished with an hour's
wrangle and fight as to whether we should go on with a Bill for reliev-
ing Excisemen from the Disability to Vote at Elections. The 53
Scotch Members ought to have attended in a body, and voted for the
Bill; for was not BURNs an Exciseman?, But the last division was
only 42 to 33. To be sure, it was two in the morning, and BURNs has
written–

Jp in the morning early.”

RITUALISM IN CHANCERY.
A MEETING of the Juridical Cogers was held at their usual quarters
yesterday, when a paper was read by MR: WINKINs on “Remedies
against Ritualism,” wherein he contended that ARchbishop MANNING
might by application to Chancery obtain an injunction against the
Hon. and Rev. M.R. LIDDELL, of St. Paul's, Knightsbridge, and others,
Clergymen of the English Church, to restrain them from the perform-
ance of services proper exclusively to the Church of Rome. The read-
ing of the paper was followed by a discussion. MR.,CAvrl objected
that the performances of the Ritualists were similar to those of
buffoons, and argued that their imitation of the Mass and other Roman
Catholic rites and ceremonies was no more chargeable with piracy
than a burlesque of a serious drama. The learned fºliº opinion
on this point was controverted by MR. QUIDDIT, who said that though
the Ritualist mimicry of Papistical celebrations was very absurd, yet it
was not intended for the purpose of affording amusement, but meant
to be perfectly serious. It could, therefore, not be regarded in the light
of burlesque. The burlesque of Othello might be less laughable than
the tragedy itself exceedingly ill acted, but still the tragedy so acted,
if acted gravely as a tragedy, would not be a burlesque, however comic
it might be in effect. He thought an injunction against the Ritualists
would be granted to D5. MANNING. M.R. QUILLET agreed with the
last speaker that the Ritualistic performances were not burlesques;
but suggested that ARCHBishop MANNING would be precluded from
getting an injunction, for stopping them by the circumstance that his
archiepiscopal authority was not recognised by law. The Ecclesiastical
itles Bill would have to be repealed to enable the Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Westminster to obtain an anti-Ritualist injunction. He
would then, undoubtedly, be in a position to apply for it with success.
Whether he would do so or not was another matter. He would be a
fool if he did; for what hotel or eatinghouse-keeper who supplied real
turtle would wish to check the demand for it occasioned by the unre-
stricted sale of mock?

A FORETASTE OF THE HANDEL FEAST.
For many a long day-indeed, for not far short of eleven hundred
days—Mr. Punch has not heard such a great singing in his ears as he
enjoyed last Friday. With the echoes of this Rehearsal Day still
sounding in his memory, he feels no doubt of the success of the Third
Great Handel Festival. The transept being enclosed more completely
than before, the voices do not, waste their sweetness, on the desert
air of Norwood and the neighbourhood adjoining. , Moreover, men
who have no music in their souls must enjoy a Handel Festival, if only
for the pleasure of staring at the singers. It is well worth a guinea to
look at that big Orchestra, nearly twice as big as the Dome of St.
Paul's, and filled to the last inch with near four thousand faces. The
sight, too, of the audience, who cover nearly an acre, is also well worth
seeing; and, when “the many rend the sky with loud applause,” the
ſº of the hands clapping is one you do not witness often in a life-
Inne.
One thing Mr. Punch remarked at the Rehearsal, which he hopes he
may not see at any one of the performances. Certain Snobs, whose
names he would vastly like to publish, selfishly prevented him from
hearing the last chorus in each of the parts by making the disturbance
of leaving in the middle of it. They might endeavour to excuse them-
selves by saying they were hungry, and alleging that they wanted in
the first place to go and get some lunch, and in the second, to get
home in time for dinner. Now, Mr. Punch will grant that one of the
advantages of music is, that it gives him a good appetite; but he will
not admit that this is any plea for his annoying other people. There
is no need to hurry home from a Crystal Palace Music Feast, merely
for the sake of sitting down to dinner. In the south end of the building
are most comfortable dining-rooms, where the vulgar rage of hunger
can be easily appeased. Instead of hurry-scurrying away to catch a
train, and robbing quiet people of the hearing of a chorus, which they
DECORATIVE ENTOMOLOGY.
CoLEOPTERA are coming into fashion. Fact. See Le
Follet, dears, wherein, under the head of “Fashions for
June,” you will learn that, for bonnets, that is to say the
ornamental tiles or slates, so to speak, worn in place of
bonnets, besides lace and crape :-
“Rice and fancy straw are also much used. A very pretty model
with these materials may be made with a very small fanchon, trim-
meden diadéme, with a wreath of green beetles and grasses.”
What a pretty fancy to have been taken into a female
head, that of wearing beetles outside of it ! The beetles
thus worn by a lady as an ordinary head-dress being green,
she would perhaps, if she went into mourning, wear black-
beetles. In that case she would enjoy a large choice of
beetles, of which many, if not most, are black. Among
these maybe mentioned the stag beetle, and the shard-borne
beetle, celebrated for his flºº hum. Equally suitable
for the purpose, of decoration, though not properly called
beetles, would be the cockroach, and the devil’s-coach-
horse. Of beetles not black the lady-cow is one which
might be suggested as becoming, and the time is at hand
when a seasonable chaplet might be composed of cock-
chaſers.
Lepidopterous, hymenopterous, neuropterous and orthop:
ferous insects might also be laid under contribution, and
ladies might go about crowned with wreaths of moths and
butterflies of various kinds, bees, wasps, dumbledores,
dragon-flies, crickets, and grasshoppers. The arachnida,
or spider family, could also supply many interesting mem-
bers that might be similarly combined in an extremely
elegant arrangement, to which might be added specimens
from the myriopoda, various scolopendrae or centipedes,
British and foreign. The limacinae and helicidae might also
be employed in the adornment of her head with slugs and
snails; nor should the larvae of the insect tribes be neg-
lected; for a lady of taste might garnish her crown very
prettily with different sorts of grubs and caterpillars.

WE, have often wondered if the chignon could ever be
applied to any actual use, and, according to a contem-
porary, some ingenious person has conceived the idea of
making it a receptacle for aregular galvanic apparatus, and
a small Rhumkorff coil. This may be one way of attracting
the sparks, and may not only produce the requisite flutter
in the body of the bird, but also in the breast of the human
admirer. Nevertheless, we do not desire to run the risk
of receiving a “ thousand natural shocks” from the same
number of artificial ones.

CHIVALRY OF THE COMMONS.
“WILL any gentleman give up his Seat to oblige a Lady ?” This
question is not infrequently put to a male omnibus passenger, and
never, we trust, without eliciting a cheerful “Certainly.” The Rain
of Chivalry is not over, and its Wotaries defy a ducking.
To make woman independent of her master is a task becoming a
chivalrous if not a commercial people, and will completely redeem our
bad reputation for shop-keeping. Hymen we expect will soon be
legally empowered to open an office in Serjeant's Inn for the due
registration of conjugal partnerships, and over every drawing-room
door we shall see the name of the firm “Henry & Hannah (Limited).”
Once more, “Willany gentleman resign his Seatto oblige a Lady ?”
This question, without any modification, we really believe might be
addressed to more than a hundred useful Members of the Lower House,
and every Man with polite alacrity would jump up and make his congé.
MR. SPEAKER, we know by recent facts, is ex officio the “Ladies'
Champion,” and we will be bound that ten thousand ingenious fingers,
animated by gratitude—that lively sense of casting votes to come-are
now busily employed in knitting anti-macassars for his chair.
CERVANTEs made fine fun of Spanish chivalry composed of soft
metal, but ours, hardened under a vigorous Parliamentary hammering,
will not easily be dinted by poking short jokes at it. Don Quirote
believing that he saw before him a monster that held captive distresse
damsels, attacked the Mill on the Commons. The MILL of the Com-
mons is now a gallant knight armed cap-à-pie, and wearing a white
favour. Hip ! hip ! Hurrah!

PUNCH,
[June 20, 1868.
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FALSITIES FOR THE FACE.
our Red Indian, Mr. Punch,
doesn’t he call the natives
of Great Britain, and others
who resemble them in com-
lexion, “pale faces”?
here are some of our
countrywomen, Sir, whom
he would certainly misname
by that poetical appellation.
For of course they must in-
clude a considerable num-
ber of customers for the
things which are daily
advertised in thenewspapers
to redden the face. For
instance:–
OWE'S CELEBRATED
DAMASR ROSE DROPS,
an elegant and innocent extract
for giving immediate and natural
colour to the cheek, lips, and
complexion, in packet cases,
3s. (d., free by post for 48 stamps.
I copy the foregoing announcement minus the address, because
among your casual readers there may possibly be one or two who, if
you called it loathsome, would think you were joking, and meant to
endorse the lie which it tells, and to recommend the use of the trash
which it relates to. No doubt, however, this stuff would effectually
remove the complaint of paleness, if not permanently, for some time ºf
least. An application that would immediately stain even the lips would
doubtless irritate the skin, and the person who had employed it would
afford wags occasion to ask why her face was like Vesuvius in the last
days of Pompeii. -
When the divine WILLIAMs made Piola, speaking of herself, tell
Orsino that:—
“She never told her love,
Butlet concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
Feed on her damask cheek,”
he probably suggested the epithet misapplied to the abovenamed drops.
Anyhow their name suggests his lines, and with them the observation
that feeding on a damask cheek, which owed that colour to damask
rose drops, would make concealment very ill, if concealment were so
far like a worm in the bud as to be poisonable, and if, on the part of
any one using a face-dye, concealment were possible. - -
Now, Sir, here is another of these advertisements, more sickening
than the first. Read it !
HE WESTRIS ENAMEL.—This valuable COSMETIC, as prepared
from the original receipt for the late Madame Westris, which preserved her
youth and beauty to so late a period, is perfectly harmless, and gives a beautiful
tone and colour to the skin, improving a good complexion, and making a bad one
beautiful. Sold only by — . Price 5s. and 10s. per bottle.
There was a time when the report current, with many other ab-
surd sayings, about the lady whose name is above abused, that she
was “enamelled” was regarded as tending, and intended, to render
her an object of aversion. Now we have a cosmetic commended to the
softer sex under the name of “Westris Enamel !” Not a nice sign of
the times, Mr. Punch, is it? The fashionable world is very fast; it
certainly doesn’t go at a snail's pace, nor yet in the snail's direction.
In that respect it resembles another of the crustacea. It is going
back to rouge, and will next perhaps recede to patches and powder.
Somebody has too truly said what is too apt to be forgotten, that
beauty is only skin deep. Youth, if no more, is no less, according to
the advertisement of the “Westris Enamel.” The youth as well as
the beauty of MADAME WESTRIs, it tells us, was preserved by that
species of stucco for the skin.
Here, again, our advertiser has borrowed a poetical thought. When
he describes his enamel as “improving a good complexion, and making
a bad one beautiful,” he just paraphrases ByRoN's words about the
effect of moonlight on the Coliseum:—
“Leaving that beautiful which still was so,
And making that which was not.”
Only the paraphrase is not so much poetical as fictitious.
Let me call your attention to a candid acknowledgment made by
one of the most notorious of the advertising face-forgers. In the first
place idiotic females are invited to buy :—
ADAME JEZEBEL'S Queenly, Arabian, and Circassian beauty
WASHES FOR THE HAIR, Teeth, and Complexion. Alabaster powder, Arab
bloom, Armenian liquid for giving brilliancy to the eyes and removing wrinkles,
pure liquid extract of flowers for giving fragrant odours to the breath and pearly
whiteness to the teeth, liquid enamel and Circassian lily wash. The choicest per.
fumes of Arabia for the bath. Those queenly and costly preparations render the
hair, teeth, and complexion beautiful for ever.
And then they are told that :—
“All other persons vending dangerous and spurious compounds in imitation, and
who are endeavouring to copy her art, commit a gross fraud upon the public, she
being the only importer of the above preparations.”
One would think, even an idiotic female might see that when MADAME
Jeze BEL mentions, “all other persons, vending dangerous and spurious
compounds in, imitation” (of what if not of the natural colour and
complexion ?) º those other persons she means persons other than
herself. She, then, is one who does what those others do. Idiotic
females may not see that. ... MRs. Borrod'AILE may not have seen it.
But all that are not quite idiots will avoid every dangerous and spurious
º, whether pigment, or wash, that would be injurious even
O a plg.
Faugh! as people used to say, on occasion, in the good old time
of my celebrated anti-cosmetic ancestor, the Vicar of Wakefield. At
your service, Mr. Punch, I have the honour to be, a PRIMRose.
P.S. Idea of a puff for Jezebet, Hamlet (to skull). Get thee to my
lady's chamber, and tell her that, let her paint an inch thick, to this
complexion she must come at last; but not if she places herself under
the hands of MADAME Jezebel, and is made beautiful for ever.
DISGRACEFUL,
MR. PUNCH,
Do you consider these are proper questions to put to a grow-
ing boy P. They have been drawn up by our head-master, who is
evidently not master of his head. The fact is he went out during the
hot weather last week without his hat, and had a severe altercation
(resulting in blows) with his eldest male offspring. I think he is
suffering from a stroke of the son. I wish you would give us boys a
word. There is no one to appeal to but the Press, and you are our
favourite paper. As for relying on any protection from a fellow's parents,
it’s bosh. So I say, you know, do just give us a word. We’ve taken in
all your back numbers, so do take up our case. These are a few of
his questions—pretty fellow to have the instruction of youth, he is:–
1. “What's a' the steer, Kimmer ?”—Give the derivation of the word
“kimmer.” Is he a comparative of “kim,” and did his ancestors kim
over with the Conqueror P Spell “Conqueror.”
2. Knot for Joe.—How is this tied, and which of the DAVENPoRTs is
Joe P Why?
3. High Cockolorum Jig.—Describe the figures of this ancient dance.
When is it considered in season P
4. Virginia Creeper.—Relate the leading incidents is this lady's life.
Wºº not connected very closely with an ancient house? If so,
WnlC
5. “I Winna buckle to.”—Do
(feloniously appropriated by a nort
a lady who shied at the second volume of Buckle's Civilization ?
so, speak out like a man, and no heel-taps.
6. “Stand to your Guns.”—Is there any ground for believing that
this was the remark of a great naval commander to some “hearts of
oak” of niggardly disposition, who never treated their sixteen-
pounders ? What is the favourite beverage of the gun when stood to ?
And so on. Do just stop him, will you please.—Yours truly,
A Boy who has his FEELINGs.
P.S.. I re-open this to say that the benighted tyrant has just entered
the Schoolroom, and remarked that there is something wrong about
Nature; for whereas one swallow doesn't make a summer one grass-
hopper does make a spring. Perhaps if you publish this it may reach
the eye of his friends.

JUNE 27, 1868.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. 275
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
N Monday, June 15th, my Lords,
a few of them at least, talked
some remarkably good sense
about the education of the
upper classes. When such men
as Lords STANHoPE and CLA-
RENDON say that Latin and
Greek composition is of no
use, and that the course of
study should be modernised, it
is º: that in highly gen-
teel families, where the opinion
of mere, newspaper writers
might not Command Respect,
attention will be given to what
º
one's Betters remark. No-
/ body wants to neglect Homer
%º and Horace, and Mr. Punch
2 would as soon cut off his nose
~ as his quotations from Naso;
%
but it is, an awfully useful
ºf to be able to do a rule
of three sum, and to order a
dinner in French or German,
and really everybody ought to
know that solid parallelopipeds
which are contained by pa-
rallelograms equiangular to
one another, each to each, that
is, of which the solid angles
are equal, each to each, have
to one another the ratio which
is the same with the ratio
compounded of the ratios of
their sides.
The MARQUIs of BATH was
very properly added to the
Committee on Artizans' Dwel-
lings, and we hope that the
article from which he takes
his title will be invariably added to the dwellings themselves.
REARDEN rose to give notice of a question, and “was received with tokens of
disapprobation.” - - -
The Irish Reform Bill went into Committee, and we assume that we may take it
for granted that the universe will be content with a very brief account of what has
been done with it. There were some Redistribution Clauses, which the House
did not care about, so MR. DisrAELI very obligingly knocked them out, and then
the Commons, not to be outdone in courtesy, supported him against all the pro-
posals made by Gentlemen who sought to amend the measure, and also against a
proposal by REARDEN. : - - - ---
Second Reading of the Bill for expediting the Registrations. The British Con-
stitutent may like to know that it is “considered” that the new writs may be
issued by the 12th of October, and that the NEw PARLIAMENT MAY MEET ABout
LoRD MAYOR's 1)AY.
Tuesday. There is a Sale of Poisons Bill in hand, and Lord REDEspale wanted
all bottles containing such medicaments to be made of a peculiar shape, so that
there could be no mistake as to the contents. The idea does not seem irrational
but the Lords thought that its adoption would be inconvenient to the chemical
and druggical profession.
On a Debate on our Public Schools, Eton was described as the worst school in
the world...MR. LABouchERE said that he had been there three years, and had
learned nothing. ...That statement did not exactly prove the other proposition, in
which, however, there is an approach to the truth. But Eton is not a school. It
is a Gymnasium, to which hundreds of fine young fellows are sent to learn athletic
sports, and to which the sons of a good many Snobs are sent that the Snobs'
boys may pick up Swell acquaintances.
MR. BRIGHT set forth, in an hour's speech, that the Blue Noses, also known
as the Nova Scotians, do not like the Union with Canada. MR. ADDERLEY denied
that they disliked it as much as was said, and the House, by 183 to 87, declined to
vote an address for inquiry, which decision Mr. Punch unhesitatingly declares to be
a mistake. The Blue Noses are very loyal Blue Noses, and do not deserve a wipe
of this kind. At least, we might hear what they have got to say.”
On the passing of the Bill for Demolishing the lish Church, CoLoREL STUART
Knox sped it from the House with a parting kick, declaring that it was going to
its last home. ...And, late, in the week, LoRD, CHANCELLOR CAIRNs, for the
Government, intimated that he meant to move its rejection by the Lords... We
do not like risking a bold opinion; in fact, timidity of utterance is one of Mr.
Punch's graces—
“He would not, in a peremptory tone,
Assert the Nose upon his face his own;”
but he ventures to think that he has some grounds for not being entirely con-
vinced that the rejection of this Bill will put an end to the agitation against the
Church of Ireland.
Wednesday. REARDEN asked a ridiculous question about
the alleged flogging of an Irish priest because a newspaper
had been sent to him in prison. MR. Adderley gave a
contemptuous answer, and expressed regret that such
idiotcy should be put into the Notice Paper.
MR. MILL's Bill for getting rid of the strongholds of
Bumbledom—the Westries, was lucidly explained by him-
self, and was then talked out of the House of Commons,
Bumbledomonians prating on until the fatal Quarter to
Six. ...But there will come another “bad quarter of an
hour” for the Westries.
Thursday. Whether, under the pretence of going to
Church, paupers ought to be allowed a chance of running
away from the Unions on Sundays, leaving families charge.
able, was considered by the Lords, who thought that on
the whole poor people had a right to say that they wanted
to go to church.
The Abyssinian Army, in reward for its bravery and
endurance, is to have six months' batta, so it will have the
solid pudding as well as the empty praise.
MR. DISRAELI refers the Electric Telegraphs Bill to the
consideration of a Select Committee, and Mr. Punch refers
the following fact to the consideration of a Select Public.
An Irish editor of a newspaper, having dared to publish
articles in support of the Government scheme for tº:
the wires away from those who manage them so badly an
charge, so high, a Telegraph Company (we mean to know
which by next week), has menaced him with the taking
away the contract under which he is at present supplied
with news. These, are the folks who presume to talk
about a possible arbitrary course on the part of Govern-
ment, if it had the telegraphs in hand. There is no pos-
sible, English Minister who would commit the insolent act
which MR. Norwood described.
Friday. The Lords were wise and busy, the Commons
wiser and idle. The Peers listened to the EARL of ELLEN:
BQRough, who wished the Abyssinian army to be received
with grand military honours. It was allowed that any
honour which could be paid that gallant force had been de-
served, but the Duke of CAMERIDGE pointed out, very
fairly, that such a reception would º a precedent,
and that, oftence would be given if such a reception were
ever omitted for the future. But H. R. H. expressed, in
language of honourable warmth, his own gratitude, and
that of the nation, for the noble services of SIR Robert
NAPIER's troops.
.Then there was talk about Foreshores. This means the
hit of land between high and low water. It is the
QUEEN's, but her lieges have a right to use it. As far as
we can make out, the Scotch landlords use the Foreshores
a good deal too much, to the extent of Foreshortening, as
a painter might say, and do not like being told that the
land is not theirs, but the QUEEN's. .

_PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHIKKIN HAZARD,
LAST CHAPTER.
THE END.
THE Bells of Benicia were ringing for the double marriage. GRACE
at one Church to her beloved NUTT ; Bess at the other to her º
dear Joseph, now, Joseph, MARQUIs of MewsICKAIL, with title o
Free-Pass-to-The-Alhambra, and Baron Cancan, of Mabille, as a special
honour from the Tuileries, whose motto has, since the events here
recorded, become familiar in English mouths as household bread. We
must also take this opportunity of adding, that Her Majesty's Govern-
ment, determining to reward LIEUTENANT MARCHMONT for his dis-
tinguished services, patented him by the title of Sir CHARLEs, to
imitate which is fraudulent, and punishable by several acts of Parliament.
While these festivities were being enacted, another scene of a dif-
ferent sort was being played out by two performers.
In an apartment in the Good Bishop's Palace, which by a special
rescript from the Home-Office he had been permitted to let unfur-
nished, the tenant, LADY ANNA Domino, taking the fitted fixtures, &c.;
on which arrangement we have neither time nor inclination to dwell
now more minutely, sat the LADY ANNA Dom INo.
On the opposite side of the room behind a curtain stood PIEL
DoRNTON, regarding her curiously.
“Beautiful for ever!” he muttered between his set teeth.
Then he stood before her, pale, with bloodshot eyes and matted hair
—he stood before her.
She saw at once, with a woman's intuitive perception, that the end
had come. - -
“At last,” she said. She still admired the man who had so cruelly
deceived her.
“Recrimination is useless,” he said, slowly and bitterly.
* Yes,” she replied, in a cold tone. “It is.”
“The police are here,” he added, looking calmly from the window.
She inquired what division, and with his glass he was enabled to
answer her question satisfactorily.
. “My mind is made up,” he continued; and then, with a slight tremor
in his voice which even now midst all his villain's cunning showed
there was one green spot in that cankered, sin-dried heart, he added,
“What will become of you?”
“What P’’ returned LADY ANNA, turning towards him. “Do you
think of that at last?”. She stretched out her hand to him with some-
thing of the old affection in her touch. “Go, PIEL,” she said, “Go,
and Fº yourself.” - -
“I will,” he replied, and undoing a large hamper marked “glass with
care,” which he had hitherto kept carefully concealed about his person,
he extracted therefrom a large glass jar, and was about to drink its
contents, when she arrested his hand.
At that supreme instant was it an old tender yearning f
She looked at him, then downwards at the carpet.
He had owned, property himself in his prosperity, and divined the
meaning of the glance.
“True,” he replied ; “as you wish. In the next room.”
He walked towards the door, then turned, and in both arms held
aloft the fatal bottle which contained a bright red fluid, and was marked
outside with a hieroglyphic character, known only to those whose trade
it is to deal in such dread preparations.
Once more he spoke:
... And you?”
“I will survive to know that you are out of the clutches of these
myrmidons of a cruel law, and then—” she covered her face with
her hands and sank upon a fauteuil.
He closed the door.
In another moment the officers rushed into the apartment.
“The Forger, the Murderer, the Upholsterer—where is he f"
...Your warrant?” asked the LADY ANNA indignantly,
The Chief beckoned, and a private in the force stepped forward with
a roll of paper under his arm.
“. It is enough,” she said. “You will find him, there.”
They entered the room, and returned almost immediately.
... There must be an inquest,” said the Chief.
...As you will,” said LADY ANNA. “At all events I am at liberty.”
The polite officials did all that was necessary, and were subsequently
entertained in the servants' hall until a late hour.
The LADY ANNA being much pitied, as the victim of a villain's
machination, was feted for some considerable time aſter his decease, and
if there was the slightest stain upon her otherwise fair character it was
at once removed by the Good Bishop, whose tenant she continued to
be at an advanced rental. Only she obtained permission to change its
name from Phlebosco Palace to the more appropriate title of Kreammawn.
Soin the beautiful gardens of Kreammawn, amid water-works and fire:
works, with lovely singing-birds, foreign and native, including the several
rare specimens of the Flying Trapèze which, with cuttings from the Boot-
trees, and genera of Corkscrew-fish, Spoonbills, and other such Lapsus
linguae, GRACE had found upon the memorable island, and had pre-
sented partly to LADY ANNA partly to the Benician Museum, were cele:
brated the Matrimonial Festivities of the Happy Two pairs, which lasted
several days. Then the Brides and Bridegrooms left in a couple of
steam-yachts, which had been previously blessed by the Excellent
Bishop, for the dear old Eel Pie Island in the Pacific, where NUTT
(who was now the Right Honourable WILLIAM NUTT, elected to repre-
sent his new possession in the Lower Benician Chambers) built them a
couple of houses, and stocked their paddock, and laid out their gardens,
and charged them only half as much again as it would have cost them
if they’d done it themselves.
And then they rested. -
And on a calm summer's evening, with the aged, Lieutenant, now
obliged to wear a white wig, and support himself with a stick, and still
clinging to the costume of his old Venetian regimentals, on one side, and,
on the other, Old MARTIN, who, unable to shake off his old labourer's
habits, was always dressed in the brightly spotted dress of the clownish
order in Benicia, his red and white, cheeks being, at his age, the
external signs of inward ...}. and rude health; we say with these
two, one on either side, would stand in the centre the happy NUTT, in
a bright gorgeous dress and a black half mask, partially concealing his
features, (the custom in the Benician gº supporting with his
out-stretched knee and stalwart arm the form of his fair and beautifully
dressed bride, while behind them rose a romantic bower, as it were,
a Fairy Pavilion of Imagination and Fancy, glittering, and dazzling,
until among the plaudits and huzzas of the delighted populace, the
kind MARquis Joseph, aided by his dear wife Elizabeth, would
light up great fires of joy, which shed their sometime red, sometime
green light upon the glorious scene before them.
“Happy indeed,” said GRACE, in after years, “ was the thought
which occurred to me, dear, upon the Island of sending those FOWLS
out with our dinner advertisements for the Island.”
“Sending the fowls in that manner, and on such an errand was
hazardous,” would her husband reply, caressing his eldest son, ToMMY,
who was growing every day more like both of them, with perha s just
the slightest resemblance to the pet seal which he had trained upon
the island.
“It was hazardous,” would be her answer,
“It was indeed CHIKKIN HAZARD.”

their children.—This is the tale we have told to you.

having fraudulently packed her rooms so closely that nobody could dance with any
comfort at her hop, should be expended in a quiet little dinner at the Crystal
Palace, Sydenham, to which the dancing men who were swindled at her party were
invited to attend. The Committee beg to state that their agents are instructed to
keep a sharp look.out for offenders, who thus fraudulently over-gram their ball-
rooms, and that during this hot weather the heaviest fine inflictable will be inva-
riably imposed.—Phillis's Rooms, June 18. A. WALAINoMAN, Hon. See.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“BEAUTIFUL FOR EVER 1"
A REPUTATION may be stained,
With smirch of foulest filth engrained,
But still the motto be sustained,
Of “Beautiful for Ever!”
Still o'er the door the Royal Arms
May lure, within our Circe's arms,
The fools who’d by cosmetic charms
Be “Beautiful for Ever!”
Still battered belles, in triple veils,
Through real aches and borrowed ails
Will wade, in hopes to lure the males
When “Beautiful for Ever!”
Still dropping character and cash,
Fools will risk palsy, pimple, rash,
In hopes to rise from paste and wash
As “Beautiful for Ever!”
Would Punch could have a mirror raised
Before these fools, cosmetic-crazed,
To show the face they'd hear bepraised
As “Beautiful for Ever!”
For mature's rose, red rouge's wear,
For nature's crown, a corpse's hair,
For nature's white, the enamel's glare—
There’s “Beautiful for Ever!”
But foully as such faces show,
Still fouller humours lurk below,
And more than healths to wreck may go,
In “Beautiful for Ever!”
Soon, seamed without and soiled within,
Soul may grow hideous as skin,
A whited sepulchre of sin–
Unbeautiful for Ever!
PENITENTIAL QUADRILLES.
MY DEAR OLD PUNCH,
. In a column of fashionable intelligence, I find an account of a
dancing party in high life, which informs me that:—
“The company began to arrive just before eleven o'clock, and dancing com-
menced shortly after that hour. . ... ... At one o'clock supper was served up in
the principal dining-room, after which dancing was resumed, and kept up with
great spirit until an advanced hour."
The advanced hour, I suppose, was about most people's breakfast
time. ...If I were a young man, and obliged by some prudential con-
sideration—nothing else would induce me-to dance attendance at a
ball, and be kept up till then, I should be tempted to get somewhere
into a recess or behind a door, and cry “Muffins !” or “Hot Rolls I’”
I know this would be a very rustic and vulgar expression of impatience,
but it would relieve my mind, and might perhaps hasten the break-up
of the assembly, to the deliverance of reasonable men impressed by
unreasoning women to go to a dancing-party when they should have
gone to bed, and to stop at it until they should have got up again.
Nemo saltat sobrius is a saying that one might think was illustrated
by the fashionable, dancing world in apparently practising a resolution
not to go home till morning, till a very considerable time after daylight
hath appeared.
Dancing, in primitive ecclesiastical times, those of the old Fathers,
I believe, was regarded with great disfavour by those venerable per.
sonages, or parties as I may say in the Gentoo. Our modern dancing
may not be so objectionable as that of their period; but still, if they
could see it, they would probably not more than half like it. We may
doubt whether, recause they commended vigils, they would approve of
so much as the sitting up. But, could they look at dancing instead of
sleeping in the light that I do, they would consider it an exercise alto-
gether a great deal more laborious and tiresome than that of the tread-
mill, and perhaps .#. conceive the idea of imposing a course of it
on persons like myself who might have committed some excess in the
matter of eating and drinking. Watch, I think, is kept by some devo-
tees on the eve of certain Saints' days. Would it not be something in
the way of our fashionable Ritualist parsons to go to a ball at eleven,
and stay there dancing "until, an advanced hour,” in honour of the
Vigil of, St. Vitus?...All rational men, of course, would in the
meanwhile be engaged in the worship of MoRPHEUs.
P.S. Vigil of S. W., a fast of course, for the Ritualists. No supper.
A NAVAL REFORM BILL WANTED,
The Song of "Rule Britannia” will soon have to be altered, if measures
not taken to improve our Naval Architecture. How can, it be
possible that she should rule the waves, when her ships can hardly
float, and of course still less can fight, on them? Just see what the
Times says:—
“The Admirals selected for the experimental trials of the Ironclads report them
so unsteady that a hostile force of turret ships would fire against them six shots for
every one, while they in a seaway could not hope to hit their target ‘except by
accident or miracle.” But the Board have adhered to the old broadside form, in the
teeth of warning and experience, and now, two years after the truth has become
hº to all the world, they discover ‘that the rolling and pitching of ships is
volved in obscurity,” and have issued a Memorandum calling upon officers to
register anew the obscure phenomena.”
The Chassepot rifle, we are told, worked miracles at Mentana; but
[. miracles apparently will have to be accomplished, to render our
ig broadside ships effective against turret ones. Yet we still keep
building ironclads at half a million each, although they have been
proved to be comparatively useless. For what can be the use of vessels
so unsteady in a sea way that a turret ship would knock them into
smithereens well-nigh ere they could hit, her? The “obscurity” in
which this fact is said to be involved is simply in the foggy state of
intellect of the Admiralty Board: of whom the Times thustersely sums
up its complaints:—
“They squander our moneys, they neglect our coast defences, they maintain at a
huge expense a wooden navy rotting in our harbours, and the Ironclads they build
are built on so false a principle that an enemy can sink them as they roll, without
being hit himself, ‘except by accident or miracle.’”
The Wooden Walls of England of which we used to boast are worse
than useless now that iron has supplanted them, for it costs us thou-
sands yearly to let them lie and rot. But these wooden walls are not
so costly to the country as the wooden heads that constitute our
Admiralty Board. Wasteful, ignorant, shortsighted, and neglectful as
they are, it surely is no wonder that such broadsides of complaint have
often been poured into them from the broad sheets of the press.
Well, Parliament is going with a vengeance to reform itself; and let
us hope that one of the first measures to be introduced next Session
will be a thorough-going, no-quarter-giving measure for correcting the
abuses of our present dockyard system, and securing us the benefits of
Admiralty Reform.
WAIL BY A SMALL “BOOKMAKER.”
IAIN'T a Member of Tattersall's,
But I ventured my pound or so
At a bookmaker's 'ouse in the Boro’,
As gentility might term low.
I lost my pound, and the gent
Was took afore the beak;
To prison of course he’s sent
For four-and-twenty week.
It’s wrong for to venture small,
It’s right for to venture large:
It seems all square for the rich and sich
What never gets given in charge.
You may book the bet of a Bart or Duke,
Not of cads and snobs and tykes,
For there’s one lor for the HEARL OF FLUKE,
And another for WILLIAM Sykes.
Alter et Idem,
SoME, cute, Yankee importers, have been, cheating . their own
custom-house by getting their lead sent from Spain, run into moulds
representing the heads of eminent American statesmen, and invoiced as
“works of art,” which come in free of duty. If the United States
have to complain of lead being smuggled in on them under the form of
statesmen's heads, our complaint on this side the water is that we have
to pay heavily for “statesmen's heads,” which should properly be
entered as “lead.”

A CONTRADICTION IN TERMs.
IT seems unaccountable that the Treasury should have appointed
MR. STREET architect of the New Law Courts, when everybody com:
plains that “Street-architecture” is the thing in London that most
needs improving. -

FAR ABOVE ST. PAUL’S.
HAs MR. Bowley, of the Crystal
Palace, time, to read the Post £. If
not, he will perhaps, be furnished
with a bit of news and a hint, in the
following extract from the letter of
its Paris correspondent:—
“Many persons avail themselves of the
short aerial voyage by means of the ballon
captif, which ascends from the Hippodrome
every quarter of an hour. The car is ca-
pable of containing fourteen persons, and
the balloon is allowed to reach a height of
300 French yards, when it is held fast by
a coil of rope, and remains stationary some
twelve or thirteen minutes. A magnificent
view of the city of Paris and the surrounding
country is thus obtained, and the ascension
is described as being exceedingly pleasant.
Every precautiou is taken to insure per-
sonal safety."
Couldn't a captive balloon be sent
up from the popular pleasure-garden
at Sydenham as easily as from the
Parisian Hippodrome 2 In respect
of the British Public, would it not
probably prove a no less paying
speculation than it is as regards the
ench * Some notion of its pecu-
niary success may be derived from
the statement that:—
“The fee for the trip is 5fr., with the
exception of the reserved days, Wednesday
and Friday, when the charge is 10fr.”
On shilling days at the Crystal
Palace it would be advisable to put
the price charged for going up in the
balloon at the lowest remunerative
figure, thus carrying out the principle

THE FORTIFICATION FOX
RUN TO EARTH.
This seems the costliest brute to
hunt, and the most difficult to catch,
in sporting records. -
ow the Shoeburyness experi-
ments have shown that he isn't to
be caught in iron, let us hope he may
be run to earth, at least, and secured
in the cheap form of fifty-foot dykes
such as two thousand navvies Could
fling up in forty-eight hours in any
part of England threatened by an
enemy. Building up 15-inch screens
of iron, to knock them to pieces
with 15-ton guns and 500-lb. shot,
is surely throwing money into the
dirt, without getting protection for
it. Suppose we tried earthworks
instead of iron, and then if we threw
our money into the dirt, we should
at least throw a good deal less of it,
and get protection into the bargain.
