-
-- R. PRESIDENT-ELECT, Ulysses Grant, of the United States of America, I congratulate you, Sir, and the
great American Nation, upon your election to the throne of King GeoRGE WashingtoN, and, in this goblet
of driest champagne, I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy reign,” said M.R. PUNCH.
“Festive cuss 1" said GENERAL GRANT, smiling.
“Your name, my Ulysses," said MR. Punch, pensively, “appears to me to be of good augury for yourself and
country "
“Defy omens.”
“Man of brevity (which is the soul of wit), not to say of silence (which is golden), you are right.
And I, too, hold her General's blade
Columbia's omen and her aid.
Nathless, Odysseus, a pleasing coincidence meriteth notice. There be points in the history of your classic namesako
which a West-Pointsman will recal, and which somewhat adumbrate your own history.”
“State 'em.”
“Sir, thus. You did not desire to be employed in war, but like the King of Ithaca, when engaged, you showed
the utmost sagacity, activity, and valour."
“Too brown to blush.”
“There is no need. Nextly, happier than some heroes, you were universally applauded by your countrymen, and
rewarded with the arms of AcHILLEs ; that is, the most exalted military honour in the nation's gift.”
“Good again!"
“ULyssEs, Sir, was famous in connection with the horse. He valiantly carried away the horses of Rhesus, and
he invented the horse that took Troy. I think, Sir, that you are a great authority in the matter of horses.”
“Health, old hoss "
“Thanks. Then, Sir, in steering for the wished-for shore, I find that you stopped your ears to all Siren blan-
dishment, did your best to prevent Wind-bags from blowing your vessel wrong, and escaped safely from republican
Scylla and democratic Charybdis."
“Classic cuss '"
“Again, Sir, I find in your peculiarly wise dealing with the shoals of hungry beggars for office, the antitype of
Ulysses smashing the Suitors.”
“Blow ‘em / "
“Further, Sir, you have given a lesson to the Cyclops, or one-eyed people, who can see but one side of a

question, and forget that a King, or President, must rule for all. That lesson was given by a hot pole, and there was
never a hotter poll than at your election.”
“Playful cuss 1”
“But, Sir, your greatest similitude, save one, is in the fact, that like the Ithacan your namesake, you, inspired
by MINERVA, goddess of Wisdom, ‘resolved to give peace to the Tribes.'"
“ Tot up.”
“Yes, §, for here is your last and grandest similitude. Equally with Ulysses inspired by supernatural wisdom,
you secretly departed for a gloomy region,
Where, in a lonely land, and gloomy cells,
The dusky nation of Britannia dwells.
The sun ne'er views the uncomfortable seats,
When radiant he advances or retreats.
Unhappy race whom endless night invades,
Clouds the dull air, and wraps them round with shades.”
“In the dark, now. Where's that ?"
“Here,” said MR. PUNCH, mildly and forgivingly. “Is not that the view taken by you Americans, and by the
French, whom you adore so, of the mental and physical condition of this rotten little old island 2"
“We have fools. Haven't you ?”
“Many, thanks be to the Parcae, or how should the wise live 2 Well, Sir, you repudiate the description, but
you accept the fact that you made a secret and mystic journey to consult TIRESIAs, the most profoundly wise Creature
in all Creation, upon your future course. TIRESIAs, I need hardly add,” said MR. PUNCH, modestly, “is MYSELF.”
“By Jove,” said the President-Elect, jumping up, clasping his venerable friend's hand with one of his own
hands, and raising high the goblet with the other, “you are TIRESIAs, and your bâton is the staff which was given
him by MINERVA, when he lost his eyes for —— ”
“Never mind about that,” said MR. PUNCH. “I have not lost mine, and if you have studied my works, you
will know that my peculiar gift is that I never see anything which true reverence forbids me to see.”
“Right, MR. PUNCH, and I would that all censors were as conscientious. I glory to know you, Sir. I came
by the Cable, and I shall return the same way, for I cannot be bored with passenger chatter. I came to ask a
favour.”
“If possible, it is done. If impossible, it shall be done. That's the way to answer Queens and Presidents.
Speak, Ulysses!" -
“Firstly, however, I want you to say something civil for me to John BULL. Say that I have some more of
that difficult steering to do, and that I may not at present see fit to express for him all the good feeling I entertain.
But my watchword is “Peace,’ and MR. REVERDY Johnson does but amplify the sentiments all really good Americans
have for you. In my name, if you'll be so good, return John BULL best wishes for a Happy Christmas, but give
him a finger only, until—you comprehend ?”
“Thus,” said MR. PUNCH, dashing off a sketch with KEENE-like facility.
“Just that; bravo! And now, old man, give me your
fifty-fift ºnlimt.
“I foresaw your wish. It is here, inscribed—
Cireşias fo illusges.”
Perhaps they didn't quaff and fume until a late hour?

ON CHARIVARI.
OR THE LOND
PUNCH'S ESSENCE
MONDAY, June 22nd. Question in the Commons about the Half.
Crown, which has not been coined for fifteen years. Is that coin to
be withdrawn?, There is no present intention of withdrawing it. We
hope not; we like to use it for tormenting a cabman, whose fare may
be a florin. It is sweet revenge to seem about to tender him the larger
coin, and suddenly to see your mistake, and give him his due—which
every .# and every spirit should have.
An odd mistake was made over a petition recently presented in
honour of MR. EYRE. The numbers and the importance of the signa-
tories were largely over-stated. The explanation was that a clerk had
taken on himself to suppose that all the subscribers to the Defence
Fund might be counted as subscribers to the petition. It was careless
but we can hardly t anything that gave the House the fun afforded
by a member of the Jamaica Committee, who declared that body to be
“persecuted” by the Defence Fund. Wolf and Lamb.
ow, about the last Friday's Count. Of course Government was
charged with being in a “plot” to lose time, and delay the general
election. Any stick will do, in certain circumstances, for castigatory
purposes. The idea of keeping a House, this weather, to debate the
rights of Excisemen to voteſ "The fact was that an irish Member
“Came winking through the House,
And canted off the Exciseman.”
A short Indian debate, AYRTON floored, and the Government Bill
advanced in Committee, Question is, shall the Council overrule the
Indian minister, or only have a Veto. House decided for the over-
ing, as at present.
The Irish Reform Bill, much scorned by the Irish Members, went
through final stages, and passed at the end of the week, in silence.
Fancy an Irish measure passing in silence!
Tuesday. The Lords read the Scotch Reform Bill a Second Time,
and received a remarkable petition in favour of the destruction of the
Irish Church. It was presented by LoRD Lyttelton, and signed by
261 beneficed and other clergymen of the Church of England. Lord
Redespale was dreadfully shocked, and said that they were asking
for a Sin and a Sacrilege. LoRD GRANVILLE complimented their
moral courage, and the Bishop of Oxford, who at once grappled with
WOL. LW.
OF PARLIAMENT.
the petition and began to count the names, found very few incumbents,
and called the others “clergymen unattached.” hen Punch adds,
that among the names are those of MAURICE, KINGSLEY, Jowett,
TEMPLE, ALFoRD, GILBERT ELLIOT, FARRAR, and MonTAGU BUTLER,
it may be thought that such a petition means a good deal. .
LoRD ELCHO made an elaborate speech, upon the ineffectiveness of
the British Army, and there was much military talk, ending with some
severe comments upon the misbehaviour of a portion of the Volunteers
at the Queen's Windsor Review of the previous Saturday. . It is hard
to say whether the misconduct of those Volunteers or the blundering
of the Railway authorities deserves most reprobation; only the Railway
folks are paid to do their duty, and the others are not. -
Ought the Knights of Windsor to be obliged to go to daily service
in St. George's Chapel?_SIR. C. O'LoGHLEN thought not, because they
might be Catholics. MR. LABouchERE thought not, because they
were old, and might be ill. ...But MR. HARDY showed that they were
the Chapel guard, royal soldiers, peculiar champions, and almost part
of the Dean and Chapter. So by 83 to 39 the old knights were desired
to attend to their military-religious duties. ...It does not seem very
hard to have to say one's short prayers, with fine music, in a fine
chapel, just across the square. - - - -
A Lords' Committee reports that the Ecclesiastical Titles Act is no
mere vain flourish, but a significant protest against Papal arrogance,
and that it ought not to be repealed. The Bill for repeal was with-
drawn, in the Commons. . So was MR. T. HUGHES's Sunday Trading
Bill, to the great delight of Houndsditch.
Wednesday. An Education debate, ending with the death of MR.
BRUCE's Bill.
Thursday. Bº the Grand Debate in the House of Lords on the
Irish Church. The splendid chamber was crowded with Nobles, and
brilliantly-attired Ladies smiled from the galleries on the knights below.
The Commons swarmed around the Throne, and the audience was
altogether one to make a gentleman, with anything in him, seek to
bring it out in his best way. The only things that . rather tend to
dull his efforts were the facts, firstly that it was perfectly well known
what was going to be done; and, secondly, that it did not much signify.

[July 4, 1868.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LoRD GRANVILLE ably moved the Second Reading of the Suspen-
sory Bill. He had no inconsistency or suddenness to excuse, having
talked Anti-Church of Ireland, in the Commons twenty-four years
ago. He asked the Lords to look at Canada, where Disendowment had
made the Colony loyal and the Church prosperous.
LoRD GREY moved the rejection of the Bill, but denounced the
Irish Church. But the Bill did not º with the subject, and,
moreover, was a partisan Bill. Why not the fiberals, when in
office, discovered that the Irish Church ought to come down
LoRD MALMESBURY could not help animadverting—and didn’t help
—but was helpless. - - -
LoRD CLARENDON. The Irish Church has failed. , Let us do justice.
The Lords ought not to wage battle with a decided majority of the
House of Commons. - -
The ARchbishop of CANTERBURY, holding that the question involved
the vital issue of union of Church and State, was bound to struggle to
the last against Disestablishment in Ireland.
LoRD DERBY, pleading ill-health, but manifesting all the dash and
fire of a veteran champion, reminded us, if he will excuse us for saying
so, of another distinguished nobleman—
“Cheers LARA's voice, and waves or strikes his steel,
Inspiring hope himself had ceased to feel.”
ant organic changes it involves, and the interest the
afflicted
He made a vigorous onslaught upon the enemies of the Irish Church,
and with the skill of a practical orator rang out about Spoliation,
Rights of Property, Blenheim and Strathfieldsaye, WILLIAM THE
THIRD, the Coronation, Oath and the QUEEN’s feelings, until the
Bishops nearly cried, and the Curates in the crowd felt eager to fight
somebody.
LoRD KIMBERLEY could not see that he was a Church Robber.
Tithes had been taken away. The Nation was the rightful heir to
Church Property. - . . . .
The Bishop of LoNDoN temperately expressed his dissatisfaction
with the measure. It would be useless. Ireland wanted peace and
quietness. We adjourned. - -
In the Commons, the Bristol Election Committee reported that MR.
MILEs had been unduly elected, and had been guilty of bribery through
his agents, but that there was no proof that he knew it. The evidence
showed about the same sordid and vulgar corruption as usual, but
rather more impudence. MR. MoRLEY did not claim the seat, but
offers himself for re-election. There were some election agents at work
at Bristol, whom the House should order to be soundly flogged. There
would be then no more mock elections in Bristol for a quarter of a
century—and not many elsewhere. It would be against the law, would
it? What are laws, passed by men who acquire, 5. bribery, the right
of making them : ere’s a rope's end coming, boys, a rope's end
coming. -
The House got on Art, which curiously never softems the manners
of Members, nor forbids them to be ferocious. On a motion of
LoRD Elcho's, the Peel Statue, in New Palace Yard, was ordered to
be taken away. It is due to the memory of the sculptor to say, that
its inadequate proportions were due to the architect of the Houses, who
was afraid of the effect of an heroic statue.
The PREMIER was taken to task for a º he had lately made to
the Merchant Taylors, in which he had said that, until Loºp STANLEY
took office, the affairs of Europe were in a wild sort of condition. Yet
LoRD DERBY offered office to LoRD CLARENDON. M.R. DISRAELI did
not make much of his explanation, and had better have referred to the
rest of his speech, and to his discovery that the Hand of Providence
was in the present crisis, and have asked with the poet,
“Must one swear to the truth of a song "
Then the Bribery Bill made some progress in Committee, and the
House of Commons divided in favour of giving up its jurisdiction over
Bribery cases, and then came a fierce wrangle, and bad language till
two in the morning.
Friday. The Lords resumed their High Debate about the Irish
Church and State. LoRD CARNARVox, tore his late colleagues to
pieces, and though not approving the Bill as regarded its time of intro-
duction, and as a partisan measure, could not take the responsibility of
rejecting it. Lord REDEsdale talked of Sacrilege and Sin, and had
more to say about the Day of Judgment and our Creator than we care
to set down. The DUKE of MARLBoRough (Minister) defended the
Church according to his lights, Lord DUFFERIN answering. The
ARCHBISHOP OF York spoke up valiantly for the Irish Establishment,
and the Star politely called him “a lº, gentleman blustering,” an
awkward phrase considering whose fragile form and modest speech it
is the Star's pleasure to glorify in and out of season. LoRD Royſilly
complained that he had heard in that House six references to the acqui-
sition of Church property by the BEDPoRD family, and said that if
compensation had been made to the poor abbots, the secularisation of
such lands would have been an unmitigated ood.
The ARchbishop of ARMAGh said that if the Church had failed, it
was the State's fault. The EARL of CoRK was for imitating our policy
in Scotland. The DUKE of Rutland wasn't. The gentle SoMERSET
charged LoRD DERby with trying to kick, the House before him, and
declared himself very !º in Opposition, a happiness which the
MARQUIs or SALISBURY hoped the Duke would ſong enjoy. LoRD
SALISBURY delivered a long, pungent, and telling speech against the
principles alleged to be represented in the measure. Lord Lyttelton
thought, the Church's position strange and untenable. LoRD HAR-
Row By described the Bill as one for gratifying priestly revenge, and
the Bishop of KILLALOE said that all property was a “grievance" to
those who had none. Adjourned at 1.
The Commons talked | Cattle, Telegraphs, and Records till 12:25.
N.B. See. Mr. Punch's cartoon of last week. It was yet more
''. vindicated later. Because the Lords would not allow the
way Conspirators to tax the E. as they pleased, Messrs.
WAT KINs & Co. have flung up the Combination Él. and growl that
the public may now look out for squalls. We thank the Coronets, and
we warn the Companies. Our Iron Flail swings fluently.
PLEASING INTELLIGENCE.
A PIECE of foreign news, from Italy, has hardly made the noise, the
agreeable noise, that might have been expected, considering the import-
have for this
metropolis—far greater than the attitude of Prussia towards
France, or the movements of PRINCE NApolleoN, or even the proceed-
ings of the Austrian Reichsrath. The Italian organ-boy has been
brought up before the Italian Parliament, and the comforting words of
an Italian Minister give multitudes of distracted sufferers .. that
their troubles are iñº, to cease, through the compulsory deportation
of Italian organists into England and France (the co-operation of both
these tortured countries is, it is superfluous to add, expected) being
stopped by the Italian Government. What a happy day that will be
which shall Fº without a single organ, Harmonian, or street piano,

of; but now, thanks to Italian Statesmen, to be serenaded hereafter

FRANK BUCKLAND ON THE DEVONSHIRE FISHERIES.
“MR. F. Buckland recently, at a public meeting at Exeter, in giving
thanks to the Corporation for a grant of £150 towards improvement of the
local fisheries, pointed out that if the river obstructions and pollutions were
but removed, the Devonshire waters would soon be swarming with delicious
fish. He had himself lately turned 700 salmon into the Axe, and 600 into the
Exe.”—Devonshire Paper.
Says BuckLAND to Exeter, “Think it not gammon:
º pay to keep weirs, filth, and poachers in bounds,
And the Are for the axing will answer with salmon
And, in money and fish, your Ere-pence bring back pounds.”
The Turf in a Blaze.
THE MARQUIs, or AILESBURY's Moors at Osmotherly in the North
Riding of Yorkshire have taken fire, and were burning furiously the
other day. Nobody knows, it is said, how the fire originated. Mr.
Punch would suggest that it may have been roused, if not nursed, by
the rotten state of the Turf and the heat of the Days, together, since
the last Derby. It is observed that, as in most cases of this kind,
there is more smoke than fire. What with the blacks and the choking
clouds of vapour, the spelling of the name might well be altered to the
O'Smotherly Moors.

THE SPIDER AND THE FLY.
(Respectfully dedicated to all whom it may concern.)
“WILL you walk into my Office?” said the Spider to the Fly,
“”Tis the º: little office for business on the sly: *
The way into it lies down a broad and easy stair,
And I’ve such accommodation to offer parties there !”. .
“Oh no, no,” answered the Green Fly, “To ask me is in vain;
Your stair is easier to go down than to get up again.”
“Scorning hedges, following fancies, no wonder you’re drained dry ;
Do let me offer you a draft,” said the Spider to the Fly. .
“I like to be the friend at need, and à. poor green flies in;
You'll oblige me by accepting : I’ve no use for the tin.
“No, thank you,” answered the Green Fly, “I think I have heard say,
That for your accommodation through the nose one has to pay.”
Said the knowing Spider to the #. “Dear Fly, what can I do
To prove how strong’s the * that I have ta'en to you ? ..
I’ve no end of ‘ good things’ of which you’re welcome to a slice,
If your stomach is not squeamish, and your taste not over nice.”
4. F. think,” answered the Green Fly, “that my way to that I see :
Your “good things’ with green flies, I’ve heard, are apt to disagree.”
“Dear creature!” said the Spider, “You are witty as you’re wise :

But though to take a check from §'. I really must decline,
Lay aside your º: and take this cheque of mine.”
“Not at present, Mr. Spider,” said the Fly, “and now good day:
P’r'aps we may yet do business, should I e'er come round your way.”
The Spider turned him with an air that said, though he was dumb,
How well he knew the poor Green Fly soon round his way would come.
So he wove his web of meshes, as strong as they were sly,
And set his table ready to dine upon the Fly... -
Then he came out to his door tºº and temptingly did sing

But I’m the card to teach you how doers may be done,
And each “lost’ in your book-balance transmute into a ‘won.’”
Alas, alas, how surely and how soon the º Green Fly,
With the Spider's wily tempting, round the Spider's way came by:
His crippled wings slow dragging, still near and nearer drew,
Not dainty was his stomach now: all qualms o'erboard he threw:
Burning with shame to fly the last where 'mongst the first he'd flown,
And hot to wreak on others the wrong that he had known.
Recking only of the suff'ring, and reckless of the sin:
Whatsoe'er the loss in winning, at all hazards bent to win;

When out-sprang the cruel Spider, and his long arms round him cast!
Dragged him down his easy staircase into his little den,
Then, a scratch—a drop of poison—he ne'er came out again!
Now, Turf Flies—green ones, most of all—who may this fable read,
To the temptings of the tempter be deaf adders in your need.
If you lose foulſy, never thin §§ off wrong with wrong;
Of the dead men's bones be mindful when you hear the Siren's song;
'Ware down-ward stairs; of “good things” and turf-agencies fight shy.
And take a lesson from the tale of the Spider and the fly.
Additional Amusement.
IT is proposed to add a room full of astronomical celebrities. Among
such scientific stars are to be CoPERNicus, GALILeo, Newton, HER:
schEL, &c. It will be a substitute for the Chamber of Horrors, and
be advertised as the Chamber of Horrery.
ALADY going to MADAME RACHEL to be made beautiful for ever, is
in Richard the Third's position of standing “the hazard of the Dye.”

ing, non-Novel-writing person of the weaker—I mean—stronger sex,
and a firm believer in the Rights of Men. -
Such, my dearest, is your Mother, and I cannot conceal my satis-
faction that I am not writing this letter to you fifty years hence;
for your dear Papa, MR. John STUART MILL, and reformers
whether they be great and glorious, or the veriest rag-tag and
bob-tail of society, prophesy such changes, that the very thought
of being alive then, and of having daughters, makes my hair. stand on
end. To be sure, it would be a good thing for *ś ladies to find
wholesome occupation; but how overwhelming to think of one's girls
being M.A’s and M.D.’s, and Curates and Barristers, and Members of
Parliament! I console myself with thinking that if the study of Greek
and Algebra would not make ladies better housekeepers and financiers
than they are now, it could not make them worse.
To return to the point, though I really forget what that is now, my
heart swells with British ardour and maternal pride when I contem-
plate the education I have been enabled to give my daughter, and all
the money it has cost! I know that it is the fashion to run down the
present system of female education, but has not my daughter learned
to dance, to sing, to speak a little French, to dress her hair becomingly,
to play croquet, to discuss with knowingness every topic of the day;
to amuse herself from morning till night?—and is not this the accepted
curriculum of female education in this great country?
Your education, finished thus, it is my wish to discourse to you upon
many things which every ..". woman on entering life ought to see
through the eyes of a mother, even if she is only a meek minded person
addicted to Pickles and Pastry. I really feel ashamed of myself
when I reflect that I am a nobody, and have not even written a novel !
But though extremely humiliated at the idea of never contributing
immortal works to the literature of my º I can discourse to
you in your mother tongue upon such topics as Hair Dyes, Husbands,
Chignons, Curate's slippers, Ladies' Committees, Rights of Men, Dear
MR. MILL's theories, (of which I am a humble expounder) and so on.
When I first surveyed the greatness of my undertaking I thought I
should never have courage to battle with it, but the sight of so man
words on paper has such an exhilarating effect upon the º: that
can well understand how ladies, take to writing as men do to cigars
and billiards. It is the only dram-drinking within their reach, and
having once got, a taste they cannot abstain; and really it would be
very terrible if this desire to hear oneself wordify had no other vent-
hole but conversation. Your Papa, however, though he has a great
objection to what may be denominated as Tatting and Twaddling
women (for it, is astonishing and lamentable how, ladies' tongues go
when occupied with their harmless tatting needles), is at all times
pleased to hear the opinions of Persons, as we may now call ourselves,
who have any—and no British matron ought to be without—though
they suit his palate better when they have been kept for some time,
like onions, and are not too strong.
... Qh, dear! I ask any feeling Person of the other sex to think of what
it is to have a daughter just coming out, or rather one ought to say,
going in, -a daughter going in, then, for croquet and curates, if she is
an ordinary young lady, or for Committees and Degrees and Causes if
she is clever; but in either case with so much sail and steam that it is

Before expounding upon this particular text, I will state what I con-
sider to be the rights of all Britons of the malesex, only excluding
Spirit-Rappers, Mormons, and all mischief-makers; from Mr. EYRE's
persecutors and MR. REARDon downwards.
The Rights of Menare:-
1st. The last word but one in every domestic discussion.
2nd. The privilege of proroguing the parliament when the º:
lº consideration has been vehemently handled for the space of an
Our.
3rd. To see that his wife or fiancée is properly taught the rudiments
of arithmetic, so as to be able to do such sums as these:—
B.'s income is £600 per annum, but B.'s wife cannot, with the
strictest economy keep house under £800 per annum. Subtract the
last sum from the first, and what remains to lay by for the education
of the boys, and for the dress of the girls, poor things?
If this does not answer, a man is justified by the laws of his coun
to quote ADAM SMITH, JEREMY BENTHAM, and other learned authori-
ties, demonstrating that two and two make four.
4th. To go to the club with SMITH and BRowN whenever he
returns home, to find the kitchen chimney on fire, remonstrating
policemen in the hall, cook sulky, mistress stormy, dinner not in sight,
and most likely out of the question.
5th. To be treated like a reasonable being, and not like a fool; that
is, cajoled into follies he cannot afford, to snobbisms he detests, flat-
tered, fooled, wheedled. -
6th. Every free-born Briton, Pºlº. he is harmless, and does his
duty to his family, and the world in general, has a right to a quiet life,
a cigar now and then, sensible conversation, and a comfortable home.
Having enumerated the Riº of Men, I must now say a word or
two about their wrongs; and this brings me back to the question—why
is a man treated like a fool by most of the women §§ whom he is
brought in contact? Whilst other ladies are proclaiming on the house-
tops that we want Votes, Universities, and Medical Degrees, and Pro-
erty Laws, let me, as becomes Mr. Punch's consort, act the part of a
§ reformer, and tell my daughter and the rest of her sex, what
we want besides in the way of reformation.
I wonder whether there will be a Professor of Common Sense in the

“It was Not Even DAMAGED.”

THE WEATHER AND THE WAX-WORKS.
IN consequence of continued complaints from the Wax Figures at
MADAME TUss AUD’s, Mr. Punch issued a Commission to inquire into
their state as affected by the present hot weather. The result of the
inquiry the Commissioners now beg to place before the public.
ated, June, 1868. The TUss Aud's Bee-hive, Baker Street.
From the Large Room, Centre Group.
Fig. No. 8. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN of GREECE. Baker Street.
I should think so, indeed : might as well be in an oven at once. I
am described in the Catalogue as “celebrated for her beauty and
accomplishments.”. If this weather continues, and we’re not allowed
any ices; or, if I might suggest it, a quiet walk, after the Hive has been
closed for the evening, in the Thames Tunnel, mine will be a melting
beauty. Am I often dºed? Oh, yes. The kindly young person who
waits upon me every morning, thought I had either been crying in the
night, or had caught cold (no such luck () and I was unable to make
her understand that my left eye been running. Am I wandering *
Wish I could, if away from Baker Street. The heat affects my head,
neck, shoulders, arms, and hands. For the rest—-a-hem —sawdust
we are, and unto sawdust we shall return, unless the subject of this
present memoir be put forward for ventilation. Ş". of GREECE,
indeed! if this state of things is permitted, I shall be Queen of onl
one very little spot of Greece, which will be found where I now stan
as all that remains of yours truly, H. M. Q. G. As the witness appeared
in a fainting condition, the inquiry was discontinued at this point.
No. 7. KING of SARDINIA.
Phew! Fought once with England and France against Russia, the
Tallow Country. Tallow ! And this is retribution in wax. King of
Sardinia! Wish I was a Sardine: done in oils, instead of this. Phew!
The Commissioners bowed, and passed on.
No. 17. GENERAL CANROBERT.
What is this costume? It is the dress of a French General of Division.
A wrong title, par eremple: there should be no division in a camp.
Too hot to laugh. Have I read MR. KINGLAKE's third and fourth
rolume * No; I hear he represents me as a General of Division in the
matter of St. ARNAUD and myself. He is a droll. If the proprietors
would only give me a holiday, then he who now runs, might then read.
Will I gire you LoRD RAGLAN’s present address & By all means. LoRD
RAGLAN lives at No. 15 (back of First Group). He says he's been
often under fire, but he never knew any engagement so hot as the one
he is fulfilling now with TUss AUD & Co.
The General was informed that his conversation with LoRD RAGLAN
could not be received as evidence; whereupon he refused to reply to
any further questions.
ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY.
Right Hand.
Oh, yes! at home and at your service. Don't call me, your Grace;
say, your Grease; that’s more like it. Tuss AUD's Hotel has been ver
long established. Would I, in this June, 1868, roſe for its Disestablish-
ment * Yes, heartily. I wish I was at Lambeth, ho, hi, ho! - -
If I could only be permitted to stand in one of Sydney Smith's
… º as that irreverent divine, used to call the stone
pulpits!. Or take a dip in my own See Or dance on my own Lawn
# Grace having become slightly confused, the Commissioners
Withdrew.
No. 70. CHARLEMAGNE.
Yes, I am correctly described as “A Magnificent Figure.” What’ll
become of it if this weather continues. , You can't say to the heat as
you do to any other visitor, “Please not to touch the Figures.”
No. 76. Wolt AIRE.
f Alºn I think I had better not complain of the heat, though I
eel it.
The subject, being evidently a painful one to the Philosopher, was
dropped.
WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE,
Would listen to no questions.
“O, that this too too solid flesh would melt!”
“But alas ! to make me
The fixed figure . "
“Albeit unused to the melting mood.”
“I’gin to be aweary of the Sun.”
“We know what we are, but we know not what we may be.”
The Bard supposed it was too hot to go to the Theatre, or would
have liked to have heard how his plays were drawing. Under cover of
a cough, the Commissioners finished the interview.
No. 117. LUTHER.
I perfectly agree with my friends, His Holiness (he’ll only be his
Address, No. 35, Second Group.
Half-iness if July is like this) PIUs THE NINTH, CARDINALs Wolsey,
ANTONELLI, and WISEMAN, also with John BRIGHT, on the subject of
90 in the shade. If it continues, we shaîali require Reformation. -
The Doctor here wished to enter into the Colenso Question, in
which he manifested considerable interest. He was informed that such
a topic was irrelevant, whereupon he commenced swearing in Latin.
At least, it being Latin, the Commissioners concluded it was swearing,
and left him to himself.
HENRY THE EIGHTH.
Lodging at No. 78. Ha! who said Reformation? Ha! Smithfield,
I’m sure, could have been nothing to this Tyrant Tussaud!
Commissioners retired in haste.
No. 120. John WESLEY.
My Dear Brethren, I do not in anywise dissent from my neighbours,
H.R.H., the PRINCE of PRussia, and His Majesty Richa RD THE
Third, lodging at Numbers 119 and 121 respectively, who are using
strong language about the heat. RICHARD says that he never will be
“himself again,” and calls this the summer of his discontent. I believe
I am not long for this climate. How is SPURGEoN ? (Left speaking.)
The next witness was roused by treading on his foe; whereupon he
º arm, turned his head mildly, and pretended to take a pinch
01 Silulii.
No. 138. WILLIAM CopDETT.
I believe I am entirely “out of order.” My arm mºve: rheumatic-
ally, and my head turns feebly. Where’s a Doctor?. As in life, so
now, people tread on my toes. Oh, yes, they invariably beg my pardon,
that's true; but the mischief's done. I grant I was a warm partisan,
always, and perhaps a first-rate growler when there was something to
growl at. º man, am I? Perhaps so. I expected that
in this weather I should have been accommodated with a seat near the
door. If they leave me here, they won’t see much more of WILLIAM
CoBBETT, and be hanged to 'em.
No. 148. HENRY THE THIRD.
I hear visitors reading out of the Catalogue that I died of “natural
ecay.” I shall do it again.
Further conversation declined.
No. 154. Edward THE BLACK PRINCE.
Ich dien, Tussaud, but I should like to take a turn, on a pony, with
Louis NAPOLEoN on horseback, in Rotten Row.
The Commissioners were becoming interested in some important
historical disclosures commenced by H.R.H. The BLAck PRINCE,
when they were abruptly summoned §
No. 181. WILLIAM of ORANGE.
Orange Wishes he had one now. Too faint to say any more, except
that he thinks JAMES THE SEcond is better dressed than he is. Would
the Commissioners make a note of it?
OLIVER CRoMwell (examined by CoMMIssionER LINN).
Expresses himself always glad to see Commissioners—reminds him
of old times. Regrets he can't be removed like a bauble. Doesn't
mean barbel—bauble. What's that on his nose P Wart. Wart & Yes,
teart he said it was. Hates jokes; but said some good things himself
when younger. Is dissatisfied with his position here. Why? Heat.
Very hot between CHAREs the FIRST and CHARLEY THE SEcon D.
Why does he think the Tussauds Royalists? Because they erecuted

CHARLEs THE SEconD.

Park and other little ducks. Wasn't there a dog show P Odds-
fish, there's the governor asking for something, gentlemen; as I said
on a former occasion, I beg your pardon for detaining you.
CHARLEs THE FIRST.
Feels the heat. Would like to go out to the Serpentine. Why?
Because he would make a decent thing of it by letting out boats.
New idea for Ship-money. Sorry they couldn't stop.
The Commissioners were walking towards the refreshment bar, for

DEAR Lord. John, - July 1, 1868.
You were kind enough to promise us that water should return
to the cleansed lake “in June.”
It may have returned, but I walked across the lake, with my feet on
the bottom thereof, in company with the Duke of Cornwall Terrace,
the Duke of Albany Street, the Earl of Kent Terrace, the Earl of
Gloucester Terrace, and the 'Misses Goneril, Regan, and Čordelia Lear,
and back to the Ornamental Enclosure (where we play at croquet) last
night, and none of us were in the least wet.
One would not hold a gentleman to a day or two, as if one were a
sharp attorney, or an old maid who had grabbed at, an offer, but the
evenings are very hot, and if you would just prod the contractor a
little, we and the ducks should be much obliged. ...Not that he has not
been doing his work very neatly, or that the job will not be a good one.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[July 11, 1868.
THE ALEXANDRA PARK RACES.
UR readers of African
| - travels are aware
ſº º that the races in
- - \ "--> Mungo Park are ex-
º - º ceedingly dark. In
this they differ
widely from the
races in Alexandra
Park, which struck
us as being remark-
ably fair. From
Muswell Hill to
Africa, may appear
somewhat of a jump,
but the suffocating
state of the weather
was decidedly most
suggestive of the
continent in ques-
tion, and certainly
every race may have
been aptly termed
a heat. The ap-
proach from the
railway station to
the course having
been liberally mac-
adamised with
crushed by the heels of some
thousands of pedestrians, produced a rich and aromatic powder,
which showed to great advantage on the boots and trousers of
the visitors, and completely negatived the remark of a., tolerant
Çockney, who gave it as his opinion, that the affair was “none so
dusty.” The charge of a shilling admission kept out the roughs,
the Bill Sykes element being almost unnoticeable save in one or two
instances when Bill had passed in with his Bob. The police arrange-
ments were, however, most efficient, nobody being apprehended for
any offence in the park, itself, though several people were taken up by
their “carriage” friends on the road. The ring was crowded, every
inch of standing room being occupied, which rendered the declaration
of several bookmakers that they would “lay against the field” some-
what absurd; and the voices of the shouting betting-men seemed to us
to be even huskier than usual. It is evident that, paraphrasing the
line of the poet, they think
“Who bets on horses should himself be hoarse,”
for anything more rasping and suggestive of a rusty stable-door hinge
we never heard than were some of the “voices of the crowd’” º:
Muswell Hill betting-ring. The Grand Stand itself is a very iº
piece of Alexandra Parkitecture, and its general appearance is exceed-
ingly refined, whilst the racing ground must really be considered a
little course, Still, by going over it twice the distance is obviously
doubled, and the victory is invariably settled after the second round.
There was a marked absence of “three sticks a-penny” men, and of
broken heads in consequence; for though, as usual in English assem-
blages, there were many who were reserved, we are bound to say we
saw nobody shy. Even the unlucky dog who on race-courses as a
rule “urges on his wild career,” i." as he does so the execra-
tions of the populace, was absent from Park, and practical
joking snobs were content to carry flowers in coats instead of flour in
ags, whilst that most nourishing but misused esculent, the pea, was not
* to the naked eye, either as an instrument of deception or as
a missille. -
The means of transit, too, were specially commendable, and though
we are compelled occasionally to grumble at the extremes in dress to
which ladies go, we confess to feeling with the manager of the Great
Northern line that there are seasons when it is quite the right thing to
go in for long trains.
There can i. no doubt that the affair was more successful as an oppor-
tunity for an “outing” than as an event in the racing world. The
managers could not ensure a perfect condition of the course after so long
a drought, and if the horses' hoofs found the earth’s crust a “hard case,”
| it must be remembered that the Alexandra Park is only a walk from
Town, and that one can't have everything even in these accommodating
times. If the Muswell Hill gathering is not an Ascot for its style, a
Goodwood for its “family partyishness,” a Stockbridge for its jollity
an Epsom for its immensity, a Newmarket for its thorough professional
flavour, or a Hampton for its furious fun, it partakes of the nature of all of
them, and it only requires some judicious improvements—in the matter
of admission money to the exclusive portions of the field for instance—
to render it one of the most pleasant of annual attractions.
We would however suggest that there should be some protection
afforded even to the “Welcher.” There have been instances where
broken brick, and then "...'
|innocent people, have fallen, a victim to that spirit of rough justice
which incites a British crowd to resent and punish the deliberate cheat.
It would be, better for a “select circle” to investigate the charge
rather than thrust him forth to the mercy of the mob. But for another
offender we would urge no leniency. e allude to the individual (and
his name on both days, was legion) who continually remarks, “I’ll have
your hat.” An assault in his case is quite justifiable; and in every
instance of an expressed desire for the possession of one's head-covering,
i.should be perfectly legitimate to take him at his word, and “let him
we it.”
PEEL’S GHOST
Apropos of PEEL's Statue.
Says PEEL's ghost to PEEL's statue, as sadly it stood
In the corner of New Palace Yard : -
“You’re by far, far, the worst, where I fear none is good;
And to blush for one's own brass is hard.
“In the spirit, as erst in the flesh I was wont,
Choice of three courses let me suggest :
When of Osbor NE and ELCHO you’ve faced the full brunt,
I don’t much doubt which you’ll think best.
“The first is the course which gºod MANNERs demands;
But which Good Taste, says “No” to, I fear;
To leave your .."; just as it stands,
To Commons and Cabbies a jeer.
“Next course, to the wit and the wisdom we owe
Which John HARDY hovers between,
To leave you a statue, but not statu quo,
Clapped away where you cannot be seen.
“The third course is that which I think, on the whole,
As original I should like best—
By way of se for my wandering soul
That now howers round you distrest—
“To the furnace again your spoiled brass to consign;
The poor Baron's friends it may hurt :
I honour their feelings, let them think of mine;
Qf the three courses, that’s your desert.”
MRS. PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HER, DAUGHTER.
MY DEAREST JUDIANA,
- AFTER those preliminary remarks of mine, I debated in my
mind what was the most important topic with which to begin a series
of letters to my daughter, and it took me several anxious days an
sleepless nights to come to no conclusion. At last I went to your dear
Papa, who, however waggish and cynical he can be upon occasions, is
the most feeling of men when his wife, or indeed any lady, is in real
distress ; and what was my surprise when he said, without .# a
moment's time for reflection, “Dress, my dear, may be briefly stated as
the most important object in a woman's }*. there begin.”
So there begin' I couldn't have believed that matters had come to
such a pass: but who so able to decide upon any grave question where
ladies are c as my dear Mr. Punch? Of course, Mr. Punch is
right, but I can only say that Dress is far from being my most import-
ant object in life; and though he did not say so, it is to be taken for
; : that he excepted me, as every gentleman is bound to except
is wife when making severe assertions. -
It must be admitted that the sin of dowdyism can no longer be laid
at the door of º: by any impertinent foreign nation. It is,
indeed, a most delectable and praiseworthy circumstance, and a crown-
º and honour to #. age we live in, that ladies of all ranks
in life have at last been awakened to a sense of their moral responsi-
bility as Wives, Mothers, and Daughters, and have learned the ART
of DREss' -
Golden Age, ineffable period' when the whole Duty of Woman is
understood and acted up to with exemplary zeal and unmitigated self-
devotion. How will my daughter's heart glow with exultation when
she finds the heroic sacrifices of which her sex is capable, where so dear
and so paramount a duty is concerned, as that of being well dressed!
A few unkind people may doubt as to whether such a principle is the
best upon, which to found a moral code; and I was only saying some-
thing of this kind to MRs. GRUNDY the other day, but she answered in
a very decided tone—
“My dear Mrs. Punch, what you say is very sensible, and so on; but
then, like all theorists, you live up in the clouds. Put yourself in m
shoes, if you please. As a practical, conscientious British matron, with
grown-up daughters to marry, and poor GRUNDY not being nearly so

well-off as he appears, and tradesmen's bills increasing like snowballs
from year to year, and the boys being obliged to launch out a little at
Cambridge as other young men do, I cannot do as I would for my
girls, though I give them every advantage in my power. It is true
they have had ii. education, excepting dancing and music, but
what is education in comparison to a good wardrobe and really
few girls can make a better show than my Julu A and CLARA and
BLANCHE, especially at night, when white silks don’t show their yellow
tint, and no one is the wiser for cleaned gloves and “done-up’s.”
The worst of it is, that milliners are sometimes so dist ble and
ask for money, the ungrateful creatures, when a lady of my position
has patronised them for years, and is almost sure to settle up accounts
some day or other!. Ah! poor GRUNDY and I have an anxious time of
it, especially since false hair and other expensive fashions have come
Ill.
bought—(for paying is quite out of the question, just now when pro-
visions are so dear, and one is obliged to º lawn marties and othe
sociabilities of the season) no less than twen guineas' worth of false
hair for my girls, and even now BLANCHE's chignon is detestably
small. If crinolines were a thorn in the flesh, hair is two thorns, for
the fashion is always changing, and you can’t do up hair at home.
Last year, my darling girls ºthe loveliest golden locks, so crisped
and flossy, perfect bits of colour as artists would say, and now brown
has come into fashion, and any lady knows what those simple words
involve; to-morrow it may be black or burnt sema, or in aqua-
marine for all I know. But what Englishwoman would not dye for
the honour of her country? and Lpride myselfthat my daughters have
dyed to some purpose. º us, dearlſº. Punch, as much as
you please in other respects, but the art of dressis, in myopinion, the
first business of a woman’s life.”
I confess to you, my dear daughter, that I do not agree with MRs.
GRUNDY, and I been a person of moral firmness, I should have
told her my opinions of the present Red Indian, Abyssinian, frizzy-
headed, scanty-skirted, be-feathered, be-spangled, befººled sort of cos.
tume, illogically called Ladies full dress.
Your dear Papa and I are old-fashioned people, and though we try
to keep up to the spirit of the times, we cannot reconcile ourselves to
seeing respectable ladies dressed with as much violation of good taste
and º as women in the Gorilla country who know no better,
poor dears!
Mr. Punch and I went to an evening party the other night, arriving
as we were bidden to do, at the rational hour of ten; but no sooner
ad we entered the drawing-room, than Mr. Punch drew back, and
said with a shocked, almost a solemn air, “We have evidently come
º soºn, my love, for the ladies have not finished dressing them-
selves.”
I said meekly that I thought he was mistaken. “We must have
come to the wrong house, then,” he ejaculated quite fiercely; “and,
in Heaven's name, Mrs. Punch, among what sort of company are we?
fetus retire forthwith.” But up ste pped the hostess, a charming
young lady, the modest wife of a fond husband, the mother of sweet
children, and lo and behold, she was as outrageously dressed as a
dancing-girl at a fair! ... An awful boss, of some hairy material sur-
mounted her head, and the remainder of her costume might be said to
consist of a pearl necklace, pearl ear-rings, and a white silk train com-
mencing at waist. Of anything pretending to be a bodice there
was no sign. - - -
What are, we coming to, then? What does it prognosticate when
mothers and wives dress in the style of ANoNYMAs Is it done to
please the men we wish our daughters to marry? What a lesson for
them is this drawing-room spectacle | What an incentive to decorum !
Oh, fie, ladies!, Burn your chignons, every one of them; cut up your
trains into vestments for your shoulders, dears; fancifully as Nature
the flowers, if you will, but with regard to comfort and pro-
priety, and see how the men like that.
If ladies adopted this insufficient mode of Ball-dress out of economy
there might be something said in its favour, but as it is, they spend
double and treble the money necessary to cover their shoulders .

A NATIONAL TRIUMPH.
MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL read in The Owl, which he had borrowed:—
“Her Majesty's Government have resolved to confer a Peerage on SIR
Robert NAPIER.”
He remarked to MR. ARchi BALD FRAZER—
“There'll be just nae Peer like NAPIER.”
MR. ARCHIBALD FRAzER, in less than a minute, burst out laughing.
MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL laughed too. Then they went off, both of
them, into fits of laughter, which continued with .. inter-
missions for about twenty minutes, and recurred at intervals during a
period of four hours and a half.

A PROTECTOR.
“ALL RIGHT, Miss, ALL RIGHT! I've Got 'old on 'IM You've No CALL To BE AFEARD
A WELCOME TO NAPIER AND HIS ARMY.
'Twas Old NAPIER of Merchistoun first won the crown
Which a NAPIER has never been wanting to wear :
And NAPIER of Magdala now brings renown
To a stock with scarce room a new honour to bear.
Let the heart of old England be vocal with thanks,
Let the joy of old England be uttered in cheers,
That know no distinction of races or ranks,
But of chief and of army, alike, own “nae peers.”
Ne'er had Captain or soldiers a worthier cause,'
Nor themselves of that cause did more worthily bear;
Maintaining, not outraging, Chivalry's laws, .
Till they tracked the hyaena to Magdala's lair.
In all the strange hardships through which they have past,
Foes or friends had the due that to either belonged;
In march, halt, or fight, from the first to the last,
Not a woman was outraged, a peasant was wronged.
From the salt of the sea, and the sand of the shore,
Through the wall of the mountain a door-way they clove;
Up the torrent bed slowly but surely they bore,
Over Alp upon Alp irresistibly strove.
If the loads were too heavy for scaling the track,
If the followers shrank from such marches, dismayed,
Let loads be abandoned, and followers sent back:
The track must be scaled, and the march must be made.
On and on, up and up, ever higher and higher,
But forwards, still forwards, they held on their way:
Till the basalt of Magdala gave back their fire,
And the tyrant stood, faced in his fastness, at bay.
Small renown such a foe to his conqu'rors can bring :
With the realm, not the chief, was the battle they won :
But from holier cause never warfare did spring,
Nor gave retrospect fairer, when fighting was done.
'Twas in no doubtful quarrel, for no sordid ends,
Not to humble a rival, or win land or fee;
But to prove England counts not what treasure she spends
If the wronged she but rights, and the captive sets free.
ROYALTY v. RITUALISM.
If the Ritualists are prohibited from using incense à la Romaine,
they may find some substitute for it in the following telegram, sent by
her Most Gracious Majesty, QUEEN VICTORIA, Defender of the Faith,
on the occasion of the unveiling of DR. MARTIN LUTHER's monument
to the KING OF PRussia, at Worms:—
“Pray express to the Committee for the erection of the Luther Memorial
my most hearty congratulations upon the successful completion of their task.
Protestant England cordially sympathises upon an occasion which unites the
Protestant Princes and peoples of Germany.”
Priests of the mock-turtle persuasion put that, in your thuribles and
smoke it. You see the QUEEN calls this country “Protestant England.”
HER MAJESTY expresses sympathy with, an assemblage met to honour
the memory of LuTHER, whom you call a heretic. hat do you say
to this demonstration on the part of your ãº. Nothing dis-
respectful, nothing malignant, nothing foolish, nothing that convicts
you of hypocrisy and humbug f . Then you will agreeably surprise
straightforward and sensible people by showing yourselves more loyal,
and wiser, and honester, than they imagined you to be.
AN EXTRAORDINARY RISK.—From the case of Risk ALLAH against
the British and Foreign Marine Insurance Company, it seems that
the Company consider that though they insure against any ordinary
risk, they decline the responsibility of Risk ALLAH.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH*S ENGLISH PRIZE POEM.
Recited at No. 85, Fleet Street, on the occasion of the Encaenia or Comme-
moration of Benefactors and Typefounders.
DescEND, O Muse! Yea, condescend, all Nine,
To aid my venture in the heroic line;
Your plectrum lend, your aluminium lyre,
And fill me with the best poetic fire.
In orient climes, where broad lagoons of sand
The horizon rim with leagues of lonely land,
Where green savannahs cool the heated eye,
Their grassy prairies billowing to the sky,
And the bright heaven is gay with tint and hue
No poet dreams, no painter ever drew :
The ile palm the monarch of the scene,
The blithe cicala chirping on the green,
Birds on the wing with iridescent crest,
Proud of their plumage and their rainbow breast,
Now nigh, now neighbour to the climbing sun,
But all unconscious of the doomful i. -
The fragrant bush—its tamarisk an teak
Restoring bloom to many a distant cheek-
With sweet temptation and mellifluous bribe
Alluring all the apiarian tribe,
And with a burst of coleopterous i.
Which SPENCE and KIRBY would have longed to see,
Startling the love-birds in their dewy nest,
Mourning the brood they yesterday possessed,
And wondering why the cruel heart of youth
Could know no pity and could feel no ruth.
There, in their own pagoda, miles away,
With neither taxes, rates, nor rent to pay.
They sat and watched the young Mammalia play;
Heard the flamingo in the adjoining wood
Bleeding herself to find her offspring food;
- Helped the torpedo, loth at first to creep,
Not half-awakened from hybernal sleep;
Enjoyed the peace, the privacy, the prawns,
Walks in the woodlands, lounges on the lawns,
And in the evening, resting from their toils,
Painted in water-colours and in oils—
A youthful pair, by boonful nature blessed
With gifts of grace and beauty, nicely dressed,
Boundſ by the tie but death of Wript can sever,
And º: five-pound notes would last for ever.
The moon was up, when in their new caique
They dared the sea and rounded peak on peak,
ting the star that shimmered in their wake
Deep as their love, but tranquil as a lake,
Flying from home and several guardians' rage,
Both wealthy wards, and under legal age :- .
He, who risked for those blue eyes and hair
All that conspires to make life's morning fair,
The large estates which his great-uncle won
Beyond the telegraph and beyond the sun,
In various lands and different climes
Where no man thinks of writing to the Times,
Careless of fame and foxes, friends and foes,
If only she were near to mend his clothes;
While she, half-madden'd by the arrowy taunts
Of spiteful cousins and malignant aunts,
lung to the winds her hopes of Earls and Dukes,
And fied with Fºrcy from the world's rebukes.
See roseate youth with mutual grace advance
º the swift mazes of the rhythmic dance,
Wile the soft hours and lead the day along
With all the pomp and pleasantry of song,
Give time no respite, and foreclose the dawn
With games and sports, and croquet on the lawn;
Or, sometimes, neophytes in nature's lore,
Examine infusoria on the shore,
Till the chill shades of punctual twilight fall,
And PERcy's hand adjusts her Paisley shawl.
High in the midst the Sujah on his throne,
Between two monoliths of carious stone,
In robes of le slashed with angry puce,
Spangled with bees, and fleur-de-lys, and luce;
A carcanet of “cat's-eyes” on his brow,
Sculptured all over with the sacred cow;
Grasping a sceptre jade and jacinth mixed,
With one blue º in the ferule fixed;
Swords at his side, and hauberks in his waist,
These set with sard, those with smaragdite faced;
His voice distinct above the maddening drums,
—
The É". the cymbals, and the hoarse tum-tums,
Rolled like a simoom through that vaulted hall
Where lions crouched and leopards came at caii,
Bidding the tremblers say why they had dared
Enter a land, where youth was never spared-
A land no stranger ever left alive,
But died next morning at the stroke of five.
Around him ranged his stalwart stevedores stood,
Lust in their eye, and rapine in their blood,
In curious armour cased from head to heel,
Corslet and casque, and greaves of Sheffield steel,
Wielding the claymore and the Libyan lance,
Awful in slogan, awful in the dance, ...
And leal to him their Sujah and their King,
Who ordered fifty turbaned slaves to bring
Mead and metheglin in huge mazer bowls,
And told out moidores to buy sausage-rolls.
The goblets brimmed, they . Odin's praise,
And made their talk revolve round other days:
Told of their chief at tourney and at tilt, .
Horsemen unhorsed, but he was never spilt;
First at the joust, and foremost in the fray,
The kingdom's backbone and the nation's stay;
Stalking the jaguar in its mountain lair,
Flashing his falchion through the polar bear,
Cleaving the dodo down from toe to tip,
And smiting wily wombats on the hip.
Such are the souls who mount supreme and climb,
And write their names upon the towers of Time ;
Who soar in space away beyond the ken
Of well-dressed, drawling, ordinary men,
And on the roll of those who've dared to think
Stand as indelible as marking ink.
The Sun, with clouds in waiting, was at rest
On Ocean's broad immeasurable breast,
The moon had risen, as sometimes is the case,
With one slight frown across her lovely face,
The usual stars were winking in the sk
Theme of the poet’s song, the lover's sigh
And the wide welkin rang with peals of glee
Arising from a party taking tea; ..
When-for the Sujah changed his dire intent
And death commuted into banishment-
The Trireme came, and at her prow appeared
An aged henchman with a milk-white beard,
Charged to escort the youthful couple back,
By cape and coast, º tor and mountain track,
Past islands anchored in pellucid seas
Where spices scent the soft meridian breeze,
Past headlands haunted in the gloaming hour
With Faun and Fay from barracoon and bower,
Along lone straths which few have ever trod,
Or heard a footfall chiming on the sod,
Through vales and valleys, gorge and gloomy j."
Where pumas prowl, and ounces pound their den,
Up to the hills which skirt the eternal blue,
Home of the Condor glittering in the dew,
Who brings his .#the lamb, the savoury cub,
And meets a member of the Alpine Club.
She spoke—her words were soft as eider down,
And heard with rapture by the crowded town,
Who thronged the casements and the chimney-tops,
Who dressed their areas with festoons of hops,
Got banners, flags, and military bands
Grew hoarse with
ºf national airs, rang all the rolling bells,
And fired off matchlocks, guns, and petronels;
To honour her and him so loth to go
From those bright shores where never falls the snow,
To face offended aunts and outraged law,
And all the horrors which their fancy saw,
In hyperborean districts, zones away,
Where morns were dark and eyes were mostly grey—
Lands which might suit the solemn and the strong,
And had made something like a name in song,
But could not please that melancholy pair,
Who in each other's arms both perished there.
So have I seen the great Atrides' son
Fall down and die ere yet his race was run,
Expire and sink amid a ruined world,
blood the flag his prowess had unfurled ;

“Bird, tell my queen, who owns yon streaming star,
That her great chieftain, loveliest of his clan,
Lived like a hero— died like a man.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
YEOMANRY TRAINING-(VERY SEVERE
DELIGHTFUL POSITION FOR MAJOR BLAZER,
IN THE HOT WEATHER...)
COOLING ON HIS WAY HOME FROM PARADE.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MR., PUNCH is a Trappist. . Not only because he sets the most
refined traps and catches therein all the Notabilities of the time. . He
is one of #. order of La Trappe, founded 1140, in Normandy. Like
Alice, he has quitted his Normandie, but he adheres to the rule,
especially in this hot weather. The monks of La Trappeare bound to
silence, and to labour, and are forbidden study, wine, fish, and other
luxuries. He has obtained a dispensation from labour and from
observing the other inhibitions, but he has devoted himself to silence
and to smoking, and means to adhere to his vows until the thermo-
meter shall permit him to wear clothes, and walk about. In these
circumstances, he cannot restrain his compassion for people who crowd
into public places, make speeches, hear music, or do anything which
they are not obliged to do. He is filled with the tenderest compassion
for the Lords of England, who met on -
Monday, June 29, for the Third and last night of the great set
debate on the Church-of-England in Ireland. Again came the Nobles,
and the Ladies, and the Commons. The DUKE of EDINBURGH, home
again from Australia, sat with the CoMMANDER-IN-CHIEF on the cross
benches, and in the §. the Princes CHRISTIAN and Louis of
HEsse. The Stranger's ery was blackened with parsons.
The DUKE OF ARGYLL, whose lady-clan mustered i and
.# force, opened the night's debate, and declared that all Eyes
and all Hearts were on the great question. He believed that the object
was gained, for that
living politics. His
THE Bishop of Oxford took a large piece of chalk, and wrote
“Presbyterian” all across the Duke's back. He was ve humorous,
and the way in which he imitated MR. SPURGEoN, while ing a
letter from that hierarch, was exceedingly telling. He had .#
to say about a concession to the spirit that excited Fenianism, an
about a sentimental grievance, like that of Cain against Abel. Finally,
he protested against sacrificing the Church and our liberties to Rome.
It was all very clever, and did not in the least convey the idea that his
Lordship was in any terror for the Church of England.
LoRD SHAFTESBURY was like Shirley, in the old play, “O dear, I
in lar
ighland Grace made a very good party speech.
#; was raised from languid speculation into
cannot tell what to say, nor what to do.” But he manfully resolved to
do nothing, and not vote, though he owned that the course was pusil-
lanimous. We do not think, considering LoRD SHAFTESBURY's sur-
roundings, that it was anything of the sort. He was reasonably averse
to putting the Lords into collision with the Commons. .
HE DUKE or RICHMOND made a very mild speech against the Sus-
#. Bill, and in behalf of the bulwarks of the Constitution, which
ad * be called bullrushes if they are likely to go down on such a
question.
LoRD Houghton thought that sentimental grievances were the most
likely to become serious grievances. The Irish establishment was the
|Church of the Conqueror, and the Church of the Garrison. Had Pitt's
intentions in favour of the Catholics not been defeated, we should have
long ago made Ireland tranquil:, now we must do it in the best way
we could. The Poet windicated his name—he was a Doer, eh, MR.
CARLYLE *
LoRD BANDON was solemnly, Protestant, and a clever reporter re-
marked to his successors in the duty of taking down the dreary
harangue,
“All Hope a BANDoN, ye who enter here.”
LoRD GRANARD, as a Catholic, declared that his fellow-believers
were most anxious for the disestablishment. Which nobody can deny,
or has denied except in Parliamentary speeches.
LoRDCLANÇARTY protested against violating the Act of Union. Dear
CLANCARTY, the Union was obtained, º } bribery, and partly b
noble promises which have never been fulfilled. You know that, jewel.
Eh, now, grammachree, mavourneen, dudeen, astore, and several other
terms of endearment which we don't remember at present.
EARL Russell. The veteran Irish Reformer made a very good
speech. He could lº anything new, having been agitating
against the Church in Ireland for fifty years, but he stated the entire
case with vigour and terseness, and Mr. Punch feels contempt for any
man (whether he regards the Irish as fellow-subjects who deserve justice,
or aliens who are the better for stern rule), that could listen without a
sentiment of veneration for the honourable little old brave English
nobleman who, true to the convictions of a life, made another appeal
on behalf of a principle which he has held so long.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LoRD CHANCELLORCAIRNs (evidently ill, Punch is sorry to say) then
made his grand effort, and in a speech of some two hours and a half,
addressed himself, with, signal ability, to all sorts of arguments, great
and small, º: touching the Church. He ended by declaring that
he had confidence in the true heart and faith of the country, and let
the result be what it might, a statesman could desire no nobler cause
for which to fight, no fairer field on which to fall. The plaudit was
well-earned, and enthusiastic.
LoRD GRAN VILLE replied in a speech of point, and said that in a
few months the battle would be fought and won.
About three in the morning the fords divided.
For the Irish Church 192
Against her . - 97
Majority for rejecting MR. GLADs.TONE's Bill . 95
In the Commons there was also a great question. Some boys at
Leominster had been fined for playing at Cricket, and of course the
“liner” said that they were fined for playing it on a Sunday. The
punishment was for damaging a growing crop, and Sunday had nothing
to do with it. But, unless they were hardened sinners, who had been
warned, JUSTICE PUNCH thinks a good blowing-up might have done.
Something about the Customs on Silks—not so interesting as those
of ladies, whose customs are to make remarks on silks worn by their
friends, and if the silks be cheap, to call the wearer a dowdy, and her
husband a mean wretch; and if dear, to wonder how soon that extrava-
gant woman will bring her poor henpecked spouse into bankruptcy.
SIR CHARLEs Russell (Conservative), himself one of the braves who
wear the Victoria Cross, becomingly pleaded, for giving, Government
employ to discharged soldiers. His º was warmly praised by
MR. GLADSTONE, and coldly ap rºi"; IR John PARINGTON.
Another row about the Architects, ending with a division—the
House by 90 to 45 didn’t want to hear any more about it.
Vote for increase in E. force, now more wanted than ever, and it
was resisted by a little knot, who could number only 22 to 192, and we
hope the minority will have an early opportunity of discovering that
the police are much wanted. Of course we don’t desire any serious
damage, but we should like to read that MR. AYRTON h -
watch-guard torn away, and that ALDERMAN Lusk's best Sunday hat
had been knocked in, with the loss of his lunch, if he carries that in
his castor or beaver, which is silk.
Tuesday. The Lords, as we mentioned last week, did well in crushin
out the Conspiracy among the Southern Railways. They did less j
to-day in passing a Bill by which the Brighton line will be able to raise
its fares. They were lowered to defeat competition, and that being
defeated, the Company discovers that the fares were too low. Lori,
§§ e an energetic protest against assent, but was outvoted
to 35.
Protestant magistrates somehow hate to let Catholic priests into the
risons to see Papist criminals. Continued complaint is made of the
hdrances, and some of them are offered in a very vulgar and petty
spirit. Of course, a Protestant may be as sincere in believing it wrong
to assist in teaching Popery as a Catholic is in believing it to be right,
but it was the intention of the Legislature to grant the priest as it
grants the parson; and though the Act is permissive (which no Act
should be, in a country of men who dislike doing anything new), its
meaning ought to be carried out. Don't let us hear more of magiste-
rial impracticability in this matter. M.R. NEATE was amusing. He
would make it obligatory on a priest to state whether a hanged Catho-
lic had confessed his crime, or not. We object to this for two reasons.
First, the Catholic Church enjoins secresy, (though a good citizen
would, in the interest of society, manage that a needed fact should
come out), but, secondly and chiefly, because the criminal is hanged on
evidence that ought to satisfy every one, and not to need confirmation
from the lips of a felon. The hankering for confession is natural, but
illº.
ose Excisemen and their votes again. Government thinks they
º: not to vote, so does MR. GLADstoNE; but a general election is
at hand, and the measure was carried by 79 to 47. If it gets to the
Lords, they will probably throw it out.
. M.R., M.I.L.'s most valuable Bill for giving us Municipal Corporations
instead of jobbing Westries, was got rid of—for the present.
Hednesday. More massacre. Down goes the Weights and Measures
Bill, and our system, or rather our bundle of anomalies, the scoff even
of the French peasant, is to continue, . And the Libel Bill, to prevent
newspapers from being punished for doing their duty and giving truth-
ful reports, is also withdrawn.
But MR. Col.ERIDGE's Bill for admitting Dissenters to all the privi-
leges of the Universities was read a gº; Time by 198 to 140. One
opposing gentleman was good enough to say that the Dissenters were
composed of the lower classes. Well, we have no particular friend in
the First Life Guards who is an Independent, nor have we lately read
the name of any distinguished Baptist lady on the doors of an opera
box. But we fancy that we have met ladies and gentlemen who go to
his
chapel. And if dissent prevails among the lower classes, it is a very
ood thing, for the religious police of dissent is far more vigilant than
that of the Church, and very useful to those who are in danger of
. into divers temptations. ARCHBISHop PUNCH is justice in-
Carnate.
Thursday was a remarkable Parliament day, but it was marked with
a black as well as a white stone. First, the white. The thanks of
both Houses were given to SIR RoBERT NAPIER, for the third time,
mind. He has been thanked for Indian and Chinese services, and they
have been noble. To-day LoRD MALMESBURY moved and Lord
RussBLL seconded the vote to him, and to his gallant naval coadjutor,
CoMModore HEATH, and LoRD i)ºr by and "Lond ELLENBoRoUGH
echoed the praises. And in the Commons, MR. DISRAELI, in language of
artistic power, and MR. GLADSTONE with a generous warmth, performed
the same duty, and LADY NAPIER ºi them. When Mr. Punch
adds, as he heartily does, his loudest cheer, the victor of Magdala may
well be proud—yet he is one of the most modest of men, and talks of
º one's services but his own. - - ---
this was delightful. But then, in the Lords, we had the jolliest
row. M.R. Dish AELI in the Commons (his friends say for the Commons
only, but this was taken to mean for the Government) accepted the
altered Boundary Bill. Now the LoRD CHANGELLOR and LORD BEAU-
champ proposed to undo the alterations—to delay the Bill; and, folks
say, to try to make a before-Christmas Parliament impossible. LoRD
Russell was so indignant that he declared he would not stop in the
House, and accordingly he haughtily left it, followed by about twelve
Liberal lords. The Government in the Lords was so astonished at
this that it opened its mouth, and had not shut it when, our reporter
left, and Mr. Punch was so much amused that he swore by Odin. that
he would do no more Essence this week. , Mirth takes various forms
of demonstration. BEAUCHAMP's proposal was withdrawn next day.

EGYPTIAN FINANCE.
WE have often of late had }. and elaborate articles in the Papers
under this heading. They might be compressed into one sentence.
Egyptian Finance is for the Pasha to take all he can get, and quarrel
for the rest. IsMAIL's real revenue is black mail, levied indiscriminately
on all the Pasha's subjects, and all other Egyptian residents whom he can
plunder with impunity. - - -
As the Pasha never pays a debt, he is naturally disgusted with the
Consular Courts, which are the only Courts in Egypt rude enough
to give judgment against the Pasha in suits by the Pasha's creditors.
He therefore proposes to, alter the capitulations under which these
Courts exist. There is nothing wonderful in that, What is wonderful,
considering that the British is the most respectable and independent of
all the Consular Courts, and that many of the Pasha's principal creditors
are English subjects is, that LoRD STANLEY should be in favour of the
alteration... It is meant to make the Pasha independent, he says. We
don’t exactly see why he should be made independent of law and justice,
and that is the independence he most values, and can most safely rely
on Courts of his own to secure for him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 21
“MEDEA" AT DRURY LANE.
ACT THE FIRST. We perceive on the rise of the curtain,
That Dirce considers her future uncertain,
For though she’s expecting her Jason, and he
A wonderful hero is well known to be,
And is going to wed her, the fact that her J.
Has another wife living although far away,
Whom he’s left, makes her fear that he may noti. steady,
And she turns all white, knowing he’s married all-reddy.
For, after all, heroes should not commit bigamy:
It’s right to be Young, but it’s wrong to be Brigham-y.
However, when Jason and Creon appear
With the famed Golden Fleece, she gets over her fear,
And whilst the procession files grandly before us,
She seems to be much re-assured by the Chorus.
But in midst of the general con-gratulation,
There enters Medea in great agitation,
And there, in the hearing of swells of the nation,
She calls Jason “Ingrate’’ in-great perturbation.
Medea says, “Jason, this match mustn't be,
You know you are lawfully wedded to me,
And surely one wife is enough, sometimes more;
You’d be married by two, you’ve been married before.”
§: Creon to Dirce, who’s cut to the core,
“I’ll see to it, calma il tuo terror:
Medea, at Jason’s attempt tºwards the lady,
You needn't take umbrage-admitting it’s ‘shady;’
But leave us this instant, for though p’rhaps we may
Have shortly a dance, or charade, or a º:
Whichever the bride and her spouse may desire,
A dull mourning consort we do not require.”
Medea then kneels, and in scena pathetic
Appeals, then indulges in language prophetic;
But Creon, the father, is blind to jet kneeling,
Is deaf to entreaty, and dead to all feeling:
He’s a stony Qld père—so it’s no use ap-pealing.
Then deep threats of revenge at the party she flings,
ct Drop descends on this nice state of things.
And the
When the SECOND ACT opens, Medea says, “Oh, King,
I feel in a humour just now Not for jo-King.
Vol. LV.
I ask you to pºlise in this act you’d commit.”
Says Creon, “The Bridal put off! Not a Bit. .
Leave the place—you shall punished be, Ma'am, if you stay.”
Thereupon she appeals for another short day
Which |. grants; then to Jason, who’s really unkind,
She gives a most liberal, bit of her mind,”, .
And she asks for her children, which Jason denies her:
To her threat’ning he turns a deaf ear, and def-ies her.
And then with unlimited heartlessness goes
And marries a second wife under her nose.
Whilst wrathful Medea, the º mood for crime in,
Exclaims, “Hymen, aid me, for such a rage I’m in
And seizing a brand all alight in her hand,
(Which proves her wrath’s genuine—witness the brand,
With revenge in her eye, as the dullest can see,
Rushes off in a tempest of passion O. P.
| ??
In the THIRD ACT we find out her dreadful intention,
Of which in the previous one she'd made mention.
It is to present to the young bride as present
A mantle and crown steeped in poison, which pleasant
Acceptable gift Jason's children, no other -
Hand their father's new wife with the “ Compts ” of their mother.
And then poor Medea determines to slay
Her innocent boys as a lesson to J.
But feelings maternal asserting their sway,
She finds that she can't put them out of the way;
And her sorrows in wild plaintive music out-pour
uch an air It commences, “Del Rio Dolor.”
At length she determines she will do the deed,
And vainly doth Jason with sword intercede;
Too late to defend either Dirce or those
Who called him Papa,” we are left to suppose
That the dreadful design of the ill-treated wife
Is accomplished, and so for the rest of his life
We feel pretty sure as the curtain descends
That Creon is safe to be cut by his friends;
Whilst Jason, no longer a husband or pappy,
Can’t even expect to be mol’rately º
And the moral conveyed by the airs which abound
In this beautiful work are in two senses sound; ..
Whilst the lesson that’s taught by the author's libretto,
Is, that once on a bad road who knows where you’ll get to P
Medea is, for instance, seized by Furies,
Which forms a most effective “situation,”
Although the densest of provincial juries
Would find in her case some extenuation.
But we confess, as given at old Drury's
Grand house, the climax meets º, approbation;
And as a change from VERDI and BELLINI,
We welcome very warmly ChERUBIN1.
“Two stars keep not their motions in one sphere,”
The Poet sang, but we saw 'tother night
Three stars at Drury Lane, each brilliant, clear,
One really ºf but all very bright.
Punch could not yie d the palm; and so, to steer
Clear of mistake, gave both palms– left and right.

EXQUISITE HOMAGE TO A LION.
Of course, when SIR Robert NAPIER visited the
Crystal Palace there was tremendous cheering, and— |
“The two bands, accompanied by the Great Organ, at the
same time played ‘See the Conquering Hero Comes.’”
This was a truly British, straightforward, and explicit
demonstration of merited homage, honest and hearty, if
a little, adipous. A more refined and delicate, because at
first sight not quite so flattering compliment was paid, in
the course of a musical performance, to the victor of
THEoDoRE, when SIGNOR Foll sang the famous air from
HANDEL’s Samson, beginning with the words:–
ONDON CHARIVARI.
“Honour and arms scorn such a foe; ”
As whom, one naturally asks, if not the late King of
Abyssinia The song continues—
“Poor victory,
To conquer thee,
Or glory in thy overthrow ;
Wanquish a slave that is half slain!
So mean a triumph I disdain.”
To anybody whose sensibilities are but commonly keen,
the foregoing strain, considered as sung in honour of
SIR. Robert NAPIER, may appear an example of curious
infelicity. A nicer sense discerns the exquisite subtlety
of a reticence, which may be imagined to suggest that
the foe with whom that great General had to contend was
not the miserable THEopoRE, but the nature of his country,
with the obstacles which it opposed to an invader. Other.
wise one would think that “Honour and Arms” had been
selected for the occasion of Wednesday's féte at the Crystal
Palace by some sly member of the Jamaica Committee and
the Peace Society, or at least that NAPIER had fallen into
the hands of the Philistines.

Cruel Satire.

The Church will be spoiled by too much of “the cloth.”
For proof I appeal to the deliberations—

THE GREAT AMERICAN ELECTION.
It is fitting that every Dimer-Out should understand the situation in
America, as, Mr. Punch is happy to say, you are º sure to meet
American gentlemen, and happier to say, American ladies, in good
society. He will, therefore, in a few words, explain, matters with the
lucidity all his own. . PRESIDENT Johnson's time will soon expire, and
his successor must be elected. The rival candidates are GENERAL
GRANT and MR. HoRATIo SEYMoUR. The General is #" by the
Republicans, HoRATIO by the Democrats. You might think that in a
Republic everybody was a º but this would only show your
frightful ignorance. You might think that in a Democracy everybody
was a Democrat, but this would only show your frightful ignorance.
There is much more behind. It is all very well for men in a rotten
old country like this to label themselves Liberal or Conservative, and
so to be placed at once. Subtler politics pervade the States. Gene-
rally, you may say that the General’s friends are those who were most
persevering with the war, and are most resolved to make the South
understand that it is Nº. and to give power to the Nigger. You
may also understand that MR. HoRATIO's party call themselves Conser-
vative, and are for something like repudiation of financial bargains,
and for encouraging the Fenians while the vote of the Irish rabble is
useful, and then for throwing them over. that SEYMQUR's friends
are of the Johnsonian party, partly. Those facts will do for you to
shuffle with; but, if you want to discuss the whole subject seriously
you must know that the Reconstruction Question has to be considere
along with the Nebraska Line, and yet that the Hard Shells are sepa-
rated, to a certain extent from the Copperheads, yet not so far as to
involve the Naturalisation Doctrine, at least in its bearings upon the
issue of Greenbacks, and the recognition of the Confederate Debt,
You must also bear in mind that ãº. MR, CoLFAx, who is put
up as Vice-President with the General, is in the habit of smiling a
ood deal, this by no means weakens the right of CHIEF JUSTICE
ñºse to be sent to Vienna in the place of Mr. Motify, when Mr.
HoRAcE GREELEy, shall have finished inaugurating the new Public
Ledger Buildings (the most superb newspaper office in the world, and
much stress must be laid on the return of MR. ADAMs, greatly
respected by all. Lastly, you must balance all the above, items, and
then throw into the scale the death of HIRAM KIMBER, the eminent
Mormon, which is a counter-blow to the demise of MR. Bucha NAN;
and then, if you read the Constitution by the light of the will of
GENERAL WASHINGTON, and the European Edition of the New York
| Herald, and carefully study ... the first minety-seven tons of MR.
SEwARD's Despatches, you will be able modestly to sustain a conver:
sation on American politics, if §. own share in it be limited, as Punch
advises, to asking questions of your American friends.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
FRIDAY, July 3. As if the Sun were not pertinacious enough, the
Lords must kick up a little Shine again to-day. They could not wait
for 'the Monday, to which LorºD BEAUCHAMP had postponed his
Amendment on the Boundaries Bill. M.R. DisrAELI had, of course,
sent for his colleagues, the Lord CHANCELLOR and Lord MALMEs.
BURY." and had told them that they must º the Amendment
which they had supported on the previous might, whereby they had
made EARL'Russei, and his tail rush out of the House in wrath. The
PREMIER's orders were imperative, but LoRD MALMEsbu Ry revenged
himself by giving Lord }. a terrible scolding, declaring that
conduct so disrespectful to the House had never been seen. Lord
BEAUCHAMP also told him that his behaviour was ignominious, and
Lord DERby added that it was ungenerous and unworthy. LoRD
RUSSELL could not see things in that light; but, as the Government
had abandoned the º Amendment, it dropped.
The Commons talked about the admitting Foreign Cattle into London.
It is a dull subject, but it acquires liveliness when we come to look at
; butchers' bills, and to find ourselves charged thirteenpence a pound
or meat.
Monday. The groans of the Nova Scotians were respectfully listened
to by the Lords, and the Blue Noses were assured that they had really
nothing to º of, and ought to understand that.
LoRd JoHN NNERs was asked by MR. THOMAs PARRY whether
he meant to do anything to carry out the recommendations of a Report
of 1866 as to the Accommodation of Public Departments. The Mem-
ber for Boston was informed that nothing was to be done at present,
but that notices would be given at the proper time. The idea of
expecting Government to do anything, when only two years have
elapsed since they were told what to do. N.B. No water in the
Regent's Park yet !
ow, about this Bribery Bill. Whether the House of Commons
much wants to pass it is not for Mr. Punch to say. It is a Government
measure, and MR. MILL says that it is a meritorious attempt to grapple
with a tremendous evil. Some wicked folks affirm that there is inten-
tion to use corruption at the General Election on a more stupendous
scale than has ever been witnessed, and in this case it might be highly
inconvenient to sundry persons to find themselves being tried before
real Judges, who, have a way of administering the law without
respect of persons, instead of before a Committee which is very hard
upon “publicans, low attorneys, and other villains” (as MR.DENMAN
observed), but has such a belief in the virtue of gentlemen, that
it, can never think that, they know anything about bribes. The
Bill º to take the jurisdiction from the House, and give it to
the Judges. It were unprofitable to detail the wrangling, and the
divisions that nearly brought the measure to grief, and caused a
rumour to spread that MR. Disr AELI intended to throw it over. He
has once more adjusted it, and declares that he will pass it if he can.
We shall see.
Tuesday. The Lords passed the Scotch Reform Bill, rejecting LoRD
REDESDALE’s proposal to enlarge the boundaries of Glasgow. Mr.
Punch is worshipped in Glasgow with the fervour of admiration which
distinguishes the erridi, and he has some idea of standing for that
enormous city. is only objection is that, during the canvass, he
should utterly ruin his digestion by yielding to the temptations of
LANG's, the most variegated luncheon-house, in visible creation—and a
reproach to London, with its greasy sandwiches, of two sorts only, and
both usually stale.
Schools debate in the Commons. MR. Lowe wanted to examine all
the great schools, once a year, in the very things they don't teach;
namely, reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, an
history. This was very properly described as an insult to the schools.
And who wants his son to learn any such useless nonsense, or anything
else but bad Latin and good cricket? The real examination of Eton
and Harrow is º on while Mr. Punch writes, and is being conducted
at Lord's, in the presence of thousands of elegant spectators. But
what do you think M.R. MILL said: “All those things a boy should
know before he goes to the[. school.” Should is a noun, or it may
be a verb–we never learned grammar—anyhow it is a word, and it is a
word that saves more trouble than any other in the language.
On a British Museum debate ALDERMAN LUsk intimated that the
contents of the Museum were not various enough, and that there were
too many things, so much alike as to be a bore... Also the place
abounded with “big stones and men without heads” (the honourable
Alderman was supposed to refer to the Elgin marbles) and a friend of
his did not think that they were so very good. The Trustees instantly
ve orders that the natural history collection and the sculptures should
e sold for what they would fetch. Will Finsbury return this Alder.
man again? Punch may have something to say, at fitting time, and
his influence in that borough has been fatally tested by candidates
whom he thought objectionable
Questioned about a Small Packets Delivery Company, which is now
being prosecuted by the Post-Office, MR. WARD HüNT said that he did
not know anything about that, but that some of the “circular delivery
agencies had a way of throwing the circulars into rivers and ponds,
instead of leaving them at the doors.” . We heartily applaud such
agencies, and beg that they will continue to do so with all the circulars
that they may be asked to deliver to us; and if the postmen would do
the same with ninety-five per cent. of the letters, our happiness would
be increased.
h'ednesday. The Bill for making Mines pay rates was taken in Com-
mittee, and cut to pieces in the most wholesale manner. In fact, all
the clauses but one were knocked out.
On the Oaths Bill, SERJEANT GASELEE remarked that the less a man
swore the better. Mr. Punch is happy, for once, to proclaim his entire
concurrence with an opinion of the learned serjeant.
Thursday. On the preceding Monday morning, early, our adored
PRINCEss of WALEs added a little Princess to the group at Marl-
borough House, and to-day addresses of congratulation to the QUEEN
were moved in both Houses, Mr. Punch, of course, drains his deepest
goblet to the health of the three royal ladies, and rejoices with all his
might. H. R. H. was at the Napier Fireworks on the Saturday, and
driving about on the Sunday,+a lesson to young matrons who make
unseemly fuss over these little arrangements.
*In the Lords, the EARL OF SHAFTESBURY got . a debate on
Ritualism, and, declaring that he had never known such Awful Times,
wanted to pass a .# on the subject. , Needless to add that he
met his match in Lord SALISBURY, who said that the contest between
those who liked different forms had been waged for two hundred years,
and now Parliament was asked to strike down one party—the result
would be to strengthen it by uniting all who approved the high worship,
who supported the weak against the strong, and who hated the Evan-
gelicals. The Bishop of CARLISLE made a good speech, showing that
Ritualism, professedly intended to catch the poor, caught none except
the upper classes, the poor preferring the sermons in the theatres.
LoRD RUSSELL was for postponing i. to the most distant
period, and there was other opposition. Then LoRD, DERBY º
cut the knot by moving the }. º and this was carried,
“to the apparent astonishment of Lord SHAFTESBURY.” . .
The i. Reform Bill has been passed, so the Triple work is complete,
In the Commons, a select party, nine soldiers and four officials, said
MR. CHILDERS, discussed the all-important question of the management
of the War Office. Bref, the Treasury is trying to defeat the admirable
lan for consolidation, and for entrusting the direction to a master-
d, like SIR HENRY STORRs. This must be seen to.
Friday. The Abyssinian Conqueror is ed by his QUEEN with the
well-earned title of LoRD NAPIER, of Magdala, and by, Parliament
with a pension of £2000 a-year for his own life—may it be long and
happy—and for that of his male heir.
“So should desert in arms be crowned.”
Strong expressions in the Lords about the conduct of some of the
Volunteers at the Windsor Review. Perhaps Lord LoNGroRD,
Under-Secretary, for War, went far enough in observing that the
offence of straggling led to the offences, for which the Duke hanged
many soldiers in the Peninsula. The authorities are considering what
less punishment will suffice. -
The Commons went at the Bribery Bill, and got on. They were
also bored about the diet of Irish paupers, the dishonesty of Egyptian
tribunals, and Trinity College, Dublin. The Lords' Amendments to
the Scotch Reform Bill were accepted. “Courage, lads, I see land,” as
º used to say when he nearly got to the end of a volume of
1807.

LEX TALIO-NIS.
(BY A SAD. Dog.)
Why clap dogs into muzzles.
In this time of parching
drought?
'Tis the knottiest of puzzles,
From which we can’t get out.
-- ** It is not yet the dog-days,
And even if it were,
We're not more giv'n to rabies, then,
Than in winter time, we swear.
But though we don’t go mad from heat,
Nor yet from want of water,
We do, what’s vulgarly called “sweat,”
And the tongue’s our sweating quarter.
To show their tongues, and not their teeth,
Is dogs’ need in this weather,
But how can we hang out our tongues,
With jaws fast bound in leather ?
The Blues may say, “Dogs shouldn't drink, -
No more than human critters:”
And if our kind were given to gin,
The Law might addits bitters;
But strong drink isn’t in our line,
On Adam's ale we draw:
Then why, SIR RIGHARD, tie us up
By this MAYNE-liquor law?
If London areas had tongues,
To reach the Commons' lobbies,
They could tell tales to prove Dogs' teeth,
Less dangerous than Bobbies'.
The cat stands charged with broken glass,
The dog with broken victuals:
If cats and dogs laid down the law,
They both would earn acquittals,
While area-walls proclaimed the deeds
Of guilt by Bobbies done,
And the devourer stood revealed—
In cook-charming All
Think, if the Nemesis that waits
On t ts and their minions,
Were the new Parliament to move
To clip the Force's pinions,
And, mindful of their cup-board loves—
And midnight area-pickings—
Wanish'd weaſ pies, cold legs walked off,
And fugitive cold chickings—
And anxious no more cooks should fall,
No masters more be chuzzled,
Were to condemn your Blues to walk
Their round of areas muzzled !
I see the sudden shudder run
From A to X division,
As each portrays in his mind's eye
The horrible position
Beholds the rich cold roast and boiled
The ..º.º. load,
The crown of foam from off the pot
Demanding to be blowed,
And there, before the liberal Cook,
In Tantalus-like pause,
The baffled Bobby of her love,
A muzzle round his jaws.'
Imagination from that scene
Of Horror shrinking cowers—
Conceive the suffering of the Force,
And put an end to ours!
ELEMENTARY AND PAPAL TEACHING.
According to the Pall Mall Gazette's Roman correspondent, the
Pope, the other day, paid a visit to his army on the plateau of Monte
Cavo. Here his Holiness, in a temporary chapel, erected at great cost
in the midst.of the º, said mass during a violent storm. At that
elevation it was so cold as to oblige him to wear his red velvet cap.
The rain came through the roof of the chapel, and an umbrella (red,
...? had to be held over his head. "By reason, also, of the
Weather—
“The white linen of the altar was retained in its place by the weight of
bullets, and the Host was placed under a glass clock-shade to prevent its being
carried away by the tempest.”
Bullets, considered as means for the maintenance of the Pope's tem-
poral power, may be deemed objectionable, but nobody can disapprove
of their employment, in the way abovementioned, for the purpose of
aiding him in the celebration of mass. It is to be hoped that he will
have no more occasion for recourse to bullets except in some such a
way as that. The necessity for the glass clock-shade may have taught
the Pope something. jºi consecration has but a limited
effect on the elements.

edwise as burgelars and pickpokkets and sich should be ad afore the

PENAL STARVATION.
IN avoiding mistakes it is rather characteristic of cer-
tain administrative officials to run into opposite extremes.
Some time ago, society had reason to complain that con-
victs were too well treated in prisons. Rogues and ruffians
were so absurdly pampered that Mr., Punch was, obliged
not only to point this out with pen, but also with pencil
}* le sketches and cartoons. Picturae idiotarum sunt
tort.
... From facts lately published by the Howard Association,
it appears that criminals, instead of being any longer pam.
ered, are now starved, not a few of them ...iſ. to
eath. Now, although the law directs that malefactors,
condemned to death, shall be executed within prison walls,
it orders them to be hanged, not starved, and none others
to be executed at all. Even a fraudulent contractor,
director, or banker should therefore be allowed a suffi-
ciency of food to keep body and soul together.
Some difficulty is doubtless, created by the necessity of
maintaining the diet in gaols below that of the Union, in-
asmuch as if it be raised a degree above the starving:
point, convicts will be put on a level with paupers. But
could not DIVEs afford to add a few crumbs to the pit-
tance of LAzARUs whom he confines in his workhouse? .
It cannot, however, be denied, and should be borne in
mind, that rogues and thieves can effectually secure them-
selves from being starved in prison by the simple expe;
dient of not stealing, and cheating any more... An
certainly a solution of the question how to deal with our
criminals is discernible in the possibility of a sufficient
bellyful, balanced by a sound flogging.
More Political Inconsistency. -
THERE is ground for fearing that LoRD John MANNERS
will, in the future, not be so good a Conservative as he is
at present, for he has warned the House of Commons
that next year he thinks it will be necessary to take a
vote, (of course, there is no doubt that he will be in office
for years to come) for the purpose of reforming—the ground
to the north of the Albert Memorial!
A MATINEE MUSICALE-A Lark's.
THE COURT CIRCULAR A SPHINX.
Why were the QUEEN and the Royal Family like might-lights on the
morning of Sunday last week? Because, according to the Court Circular
for that day—
“Her Majesty the QUEEN, and the Princes and Princesses went out this
morning.”
After this alarming announcement it was reassuring to learn that Her
Majesty and her illustrious children had continued to pursue their
usual occupations.
“In the Multitude of Councillors there is (no) Wisdom.”
THE Judy of our bosom, reading of the proposed. General Council,
long insisted on confounding “cecumenical” with “economical.” We
have at last succeeded in impressing upon her, that though the sound;
are almost alike, the meanings are as nearly as may be the reverse of
each other. An “economical” council is a Saving council. An
“gecumenical” council is a council that never saved anybody or any-
thing; but has precipitated the destruction of a good many.
PROTESTANT THOUGHT.
The Pope's Bull of Invitation to the (Ecumenical Council was pub-
lished to the sound of silver shawms. , Before the Prelates come, Rome
may have heard the trumpets of Jericho.

A POET'S INDIGNATION.
IR, -
You have been down upon me a good many times, but I know
you love justice, and I º ask your aid. Sir, it has been re.
ported that I am the author of the words of the song sung (and
excellently, I hear, by MR. CUMMINGs) at the Crystal Palace on the
day the DUKE of EDINBURGH was there. , . - - - -
§: Mr. Punch, it is not true. I had nothing to do with it. . .
I allow, Sir, that the style of the so-called Poet is based upon mine,
and that the mistake is not unnatural. But when you come to look at
the verses that were sung, you will see that I, the PoET CLose, could
never have written such nonsense. Look here, Sir.
DEAR
“Of NELson, Hood, and Collingwood,
Our grandsires used to sing ;
Our fathers had a toast as gººd,
They gave the Sailor King!”
Now royal ALFRED treads the deck,
His courage to evince;
He braves the storm, nor fears the wreck;
God bless our Sailor Prince : ”
Treads the deck to evince his courage ' Mr. Punch, would I thus
libel my Prince? He treads the deck for no such unseamanlike and
idiotic purpose. He treads the deck because it is his duty to do so
| at the right time goes below for the same reason. But worse stuff
follows.
“Young, brave and true, he wears the blue,
His courage to evince,
The pride, ‘the darling of his crew;'
God bless our Sailor Prince . "
Wears the blue to evince his courage! One would think that it was
a proscribed colour, and that like wearing of the green in Ireland, the
feat was one of danger. Isn't it sad that thousands of folk should have
to hear such bosh But there is worse still.
“When o'er the land a flash of pain,
Shot through th' electric wire,
That England's darling son was slain,
High rose the people's ire;
Now let him know, the coward blow
Our fealty doth evince,
And blend our prayers, that God who spares,
May save our Sailor Prince.”
What does the so-called Poet mean by saying that a flash of pain
shot .# the electric wire? Did it hurt the wire And how does
the coward blow (which wasn't a blow) evince our fealty The fact is
Sir, that the barren-brained bard wanted to rhyme to Prince, and
could think of no rhyme but evince. I, Sir, could have given him
many rhymes, much better; as
Our noble Prince
Did never wince,
But ever since,
When eating mince,
Has wished for quince,
His mouth to rinse,
And thus convince
That he is every inch a Prince.
Sir, as the LADY FLORENCE PEPPLE, the sister of the young King of
Bonny, successor to him of whom I was proud to be Laureate, is coming
over, and I shall have to address her in song, it might do me injury in
* business if I were supposed capable of writing such verses as those
I have quoted. By giving publication to the facts, you will oblige,
Your obedient Servant, THE POET CLOSE.
July, 1868.
What will the Teetotallers say?
THE REv. DR. JELF, on retiring from the Principalship of King's
College, London, had a testimonial presented to him. You shall have
as many guesses as you like, and yet you shall not find out what, was
selected to be given to a Doctor of Divinity on resigning the headship
of a great educational establishment. A Theological ºil.” A set
of clerical robes?. A full-length portrait? A silver tea and coffee
service? A candelabrum ?--All, wrong. They gave him (besides
founding a Jelf É. or iºlºrship, or something of that commendable
character), “A Bacchanalian Wase!” This we can only suppose to be
classical either for a claret-jug or a wine-cooler—a punch-bowl being,
of course, out of the question. Whichever it may be, we heartily wish
the excellent Doctor many years' use of it!

ALDERMAN LUSK.
“MR. ALDERMAN LUsk could not congratulate the Museum upon its success
in a popular point of view. Notwithstanding the sums that had been spent
on it, the people did not go to it as they used to do, and the number of visitors
fell off every year. . . . A person he knew said of one room that it was
‘ full of big stones, and men without heads, and he did not see much merit in
them.'. (A laugh.) He told his friend he was not perhaps a judge of fine art,
but being himself in the room devoted to antiquities the other day, not a
single person was to be seen. People wanted greater variety, and not so much
of one thing to look at.”—Debate of Wednesday, July 8th.
ALDERMAN LUsk may love things that bring grist in ;
ALDERMAN LUsk may be purely Philistine; .
ALDERMAN LUsk MATTHEw ARNOLD may slight
ALDERMAN LUsk may scorn “sweetness” and light;
ALDERMAN LUSK may not see, for M.P.'s use,
What's the #. of your Fates, your Ilyssus, or Theseus;
ALDERMAN LUsk on the marbles of PHIDLAs -
May look but as “damaged lots,” more or less hideous.
In whom AIDERMAN Lusk may feel want of clothesis,
Still worse than the want of heads, legs, arms, and noses.
But when ALDERMAN LUsk takes his trumpet, he blows it—
“. He don't want no Museums, and don’t care who knows it.”
Philistine he may be, but one thing he’s not,
A Pretender, that is, to more taste than he’s got.
And were all our Philistine M.P.'s, LUsk, like you,
The Fine Arts would fare better with us than they'do.
Philistines with no tastes, on Art may keep quiet,
Philistines with had tastes are sure to run riot'
AN EXAMPLE TO OUR NEIGHBOURS.
IN the French Legislative Chamber, the other day, M. EMILE
OLLIVIER made a speech against the financial extravagance of the
Imperial Government, in which he said:—
“In France, we shall never, come to bankruptcy, but we shall arrive at
expedients such as we know have been adopted in countries which have
entered upon the dangerous routes in which we ourselves are now travelling :
we shall come to taxes on the rente: we shall come to paper money.”
This prophecy was received with “loud exclamations.” Well it
might have been. France has a frightful example before her. We
English have come to “taxes on the rente” already, and worse; we
have also come to a tax on hypothetical income. What we shall finall
come to, Heaven only knows. Possibly not grief. , Perhaps a #.
Parliament, elected by the People, will readjust fiscal burdens on the
acknowledged principle that partial taxation is confiscation. Let us
hope for the best.
SAD WASTE OF OIL.
A, TELEGRAM from Belgrade, dated July 5, informed newspaper
readers that:—
“The solemn unction of PRINCE MILAN, as Sovereign of Servia, took place
at the Cathedral to-day.”
So it seems unction is not only practised in the Roman Church, but
also in the Greek, and indeed a punster would remark that it is a rite
which might be supposed to be especially characteristic of the Church
of Greece. . In these days of progress, and especially steam-progress
when people are so familiar with the process of oiling machinery, i
does seem rather an odd trick to oil a king. If ºff. princes are
oiled, why not sovereign presidents? Af. ANDREw Johnson was
never oiled, but if he had been is it likely that he would have suffered
any less than he has from friction with Congress * Louis NAPOLEON
has never yet been oiled as Emperor of the French, and yet he appears
to rub on in that capacity tolerably well.

THE PATENT PREMIER.
(From the “Arcana of Art.”)
This is a very clever invention. Until recently it was thought impracticable
to produce a Premier possessing such comprehensive properties—the vis inertia
in perpetual motion. Picture to your perplexed imagination a solid body attached
to a fixed point while constantly progressing, in political space. Science smiles
upon her latest triumph-a Premier in a rapid state of oscillation, and never for
one moment in danger of being displaced. . - -
Several curious mechanicians have examined its intricate works, and confess
themselves unable to discover by what combination of secret springs its vibratory
action is regulated. To some extent, the Patent Premier resembles an ordinary
repeater with a dial elegantly enamelled, but its maintaining power surpasses that
of any similar instrument extant; . -
The Premier has a heavy striking weight and a powerful alarum-so powerful,
indeed, as to startle many superstitious people in the dark. Another remarkable-
feature about the Patent Premier is its marvellous accuracy. It is warranted never
to go wrong, nor. to stand in need of correction, its capacity of self-adjustment
rendering it peculiarly suitable for any Government office. e are happy to see
that our most influential merchants—those connected with the Tailors—have set
up the Patent Premier in their Hall of Audience, where its, ticking is listened
to with whispered delight and admiration. If furnished with stronger hands—
at present those indispensable adjuncts are somewhat rickety–the Patent Pre-
mier would really be a valuable church-clock. As it now stands, the Premier

A Place very much Wanted.
THERE are not too many employments in the public.service open to men who

an office for which skilled authors # would be a qualification is suggested by the
disputes continually occurring on the construction of Acts of Parliament, The
ambiguity and obscurity of parliamentary enactments is due to their not havin
been properly revised and corrected. To put the language of all bills into suc
order as to fit them to become law, Parliament wants an Editor.

Where stars and stripes wave high

But here, ah me, I nowhere see
The drinks the time requires;
If, clubless, I for “coolers” cry,
What answers my desires?
There’s soda-water, lemonade,
And there’s Imperial Pop;
There's SAINSBURY's fruit syrups, made
At his peculiar shop.
There’s lemon-kali, with the gripes
Resulting from its use; -
There’s more or less adulterate swipes,
In quantities profuse. -
There’s JAcob Townsend's cooling draught,
Sarsaparilla sp’iled;
But for my taste, however chaste,
Drinks may be drawn “too mild.”
There’s what for BAss attempts to pass,

MARRIAGE ON A MODERATE INCOME.
GENTLEMEN entertaining the question whether a man can afford to
marry on, £1,000 a year, are informed, in an advertisement by a
Milliner, that there exists at a shop in Regent Street:—
HE LARGEST COLLECTION of ANTIQUE and MODERN REAL
LACES in EUROPE.-The new Bruxelles pointe d'aiguille bridal veils
(without powder), 10 to 100 guineas; volants, tuniques, &c., ensuite. Shawls
in every kind of real lace, 5 to 500 guineas (many exclusive designs and par-
ticularly adapted for wedding trousseaux). Real laces of every description
direct from the ouvrières at the lowest prices.”
This information may suggest the inquiry whether shawls at from 5
to 500 guineas each, particularly adapted for wedding trousseaux, con-
stitute a beginning that may be looked upon as an earnest of the way
in which a wife, is likely to go on. . If so, this sort of earnest will be
no fun for anybody but a millionnaire, who thinksunlimited expenditure
a joke. That amongst those shawls there are some whose designs are
exclusive, one would think likely. The designs of 500 guinea shawls
must be exclusive of all º except those endowed much more
plentifully with money than with brains, unless endowed with practi-
cally no end of money. From the figures named with reference to
shawls and veils, the lowest prices of real laces would seem to be too
high to admit of matrimony on a pittance of £1,000 * annum. Bridal
veils at from ten to a hundred guineas may be thoug t to imply brides
ortionally, expensive in every, other particular. All this is intel-
É. but what is the meaning of bridal veils without powder? Not
surely that they are composed of materials like gun-cotton, which will
blow up. That can be no recommendation, although many husbands
may wish that such costly veils were exploded.

THE RAILWAY AMALGAMATION SCREW.
THE subjoined extract from the Railway News looks rather like a
defiance thrown in the teeth of Parliament and the People of England
by certain Directors of:—
“THE RAILWAYs South of THE THAMEs.-One of the first effects of the
withdrawal of the Amalgamation Bill of the Southern lines will very shortly
be felt by the public. É. to the present time several of the Brighton trains
have been allowed to run into the Cannon Street terminus. As, however,
Parliament has refused power for the South-Eastern to charge a reasonable
toll for the use of the station on which so large a sum has been expended, the
directors have given notice to the Brighton Company that their trains will
not, on and after August 1st, be allowed to enter the station. Some additions
to the fares, which the company have power to make under their present Act,
will also come into force at that time.”
“We will see whether you and your Legislature, or we are the
stronger. We will try whether we have not the power to, make you
accept our terms, and submit to what you are pleased to call our impo-
sition.” Such is clearly the meaning of the announcement that the
Brighton Company's trains will be excluded from the South Eastern's
station, and the intimation that, simultaneously, the fares will be raised
to the highest s allowed by law. In short, the Railways South of
the Thames inform the British Public that, in order to extort consent
to their rapacious Amalgamation scheme, they are about to put on the
screw. Let them. A few turns of that instrument will probably have
a different effect from what they contemplate. Already Government is

Artiste can be seen for sir shillings in Paris.

to be peculiarly “chiquey") sinacking a little riding-whip in front of

Young Brown (to Miss Sharpe). What do you think of her ?
Miss Sharpe (sensibly). I haven't seen enough of her yet to judge.
[YouNG BRow N is astonished, he has always heard ScHNEIDER
praised immediately she has appeared.
The Great actress then walks round, leers at her audience, winks at
them, takes them into her confidence in bye-play, smacks, her whip,
i. a little kick of the leg, hits two or three people, including a pon-
erous Frenchman, doing his best in a perspiring performance of General
Boum (the original pºor Koud E.R.—was very good, and not a bit of a
buffoon) and sings “Ah, que j'aime les militaires,” during which, with
an admirable display of wit and humour, and with an elegance of action
which belongs, we are glad to hope, to this actress alone, Mlle.
SchNEIDER kicks her leg up in the air, and hits the person nearest to
her with her riding whip. º: greater part of the “business” of the
First Act seems to consist in hitting each other, grimacing, upsetting
tables and such morel practical fun.
º: Smith (to her husband, indignantly). Well, if that’s what you
mlre—
Smith (rather taken aback, and apologising). She didn’t do that in Paris.
f Whenever this “kicking up behind and before” is repeated, shouts
of laughter issue from certain private boxes saluting this and the con-
stant repetition of hitting anybody with her whip as an inimitable piece
of burlesque humour. o or three true English ladies, in Nobility's

Miss Sharpe (who, for reasons abore-mentioned, is something ºf a critic).
She's very vulgar, and I am sure that any of our actresses who play
burlesque are infinitely superior to SchNEIDER.

Miss FARREN, MRs. How ARD PAUL, &c., &c.
Young Brown (feeling that she is not far wrong). Yes, but—[falling
back upon his one resource)—they haven’t got the chique.
Miss Sharpe (following up her attack). i; you mean they are not so
º vulgar, I hope that they never will have the chique, as it is
called.

going to play together at LADY KETTLEDRUM's in a few days.
Robinson (during entr’acte, to Young Brotch in the lobby, quoting
Flannay as his own opinion). She has du chien, eh?
Thinks he has shut up You NG BRow N, then.
Young Brown (thinking of Miss Sharpe, and gradually coming to a
decision). If I want to see this sort of thing I can do so legitimately
at one of our music-halls. It’s only a form of the Fast Female Comic
Singer.
Jack Bull, Esq., Jun. (to his young Wife). SCHNEIDER may be the
Duchess, but no one would call her your Grace.
M. j. Bull, Jun. (after the Second Act, when the Grande Duchesse
has sung “ Dites-lui,” and Jºined in the can-can). If any but a French
actress had done this, she'd have been hissed off the stage. I’m sure
she would—it’s disgusting !
* Jack Bull (highly respecting his Hºſe's candour). Yes, it is; but they
really do manage these things better in France; for there, ScHNEIDER,
whose performance, by the way, as it is, is witnessed chiefly by ladies
of the faster sort, would not do a quarter of what she has done here.
What was hinted at the Variétés, is developed at the St. James's. In
the song, for instance, of “Diſes-lui,” where you admit that SchNEIDER
manages the few notes she has in her voice admirably, or it were more
correct to say, M. OFFENBAch manages them for her, she grossly over-
acted. She out Schneiders SciNerº here.
Mrs. J. Bull, Jun. (from an economical point ſ view). As we have
lº ºil. enough to pay a guinea for our stalls, we will remain to
e ell(1.
She does so, and understanding French and French acting, is not
particularly deſ ghted with the Third Act, showing how Messieurs les
tambours disturbed Fritz and handa; nor with the Grande Duchesse's
Hº! of Baron Grog, and her reason for marrying Prince Paul in
the Fifth.
LoRD NINKUM is delighted throughout, and applauds all the strong
points throughout most heartily. Flannay in the stalls follows suit, and
the after-dinner party in the stage-box are in ecstasies over the action
and manner of Mademoiselle in the “Dites-lui” song especially.
Flannay (to Robinson at the door, during the entr’acte, where they are
smoking cigarettes—so like Paris.) She's delicious! it’s quite refreshing
to see her. (Assumes the character ºf l'homme blasé.)

ULL, SENIOR, note asleep.) It is a pity that the QUEEN does not re-
sume her personal patronage of our theatres. From your account, my
dear (To MRS. J. B. JUNIOR), I do not think that such a performance
would have been tolerated by Her Majesty. What do you say, John ”

Mr. John Bull (awakening to the situation). My dear, I don’t under-
stand this introduction of can-cans. I can't make out why my licences
permits to French players in England what would neither be allowed
to our own performers, nor to them, I believe, in their own country.
Some two hundred years ago we English required an apology for the
appearance of a female actor upon the stage. For another reason, it
seems to be required now. The stage, as a clever writer has observed,
should be a popular school of morality, a supplement to the pulpit
where virtue, according to PLATO's sublime idea, nerves our love an
affections, where—

Would you like to see SchNEIDER in La Belle Hélène &
Both Ladies (decidedly). No, thank you. Instead of wastin
money on that, take ...ſ. for the Opera. [All retire.
P.S. Since writing the above I have seen La Belle Hélène—announced,
by the way, as produced for the first time in London. This is not
correct. Helen, with º: the music, was done at the Adelphi,
and M. OFFENBAcH himself complimented Miss FURTADo upon her
performance of the beautiful Queen. Miss FURTADo had the advan-
tage over, MLL.E. ScHNEIDER in many respects, and MR. ToolE was
far beyond his French prototype as Menelaus. Neither of them can sing
brilliantly. Again, the riddle scene in the First Act is tedious in the
French original, as is also the Game of Goose in the Second Act, which
was wisely omitted at the Adelphi.
In its French form, and played as it is at the St. James's, it would
not last a week here were it not for MLLE. SchNEIDER's prestige and
the judiciously high prices; but Helen at the Adelphi, with MRs.
MELLON, Miss FuRTADQ, and PAUL BEDFORD (pleasanter to the eye in
his stolidity than is M. Ravel, with his overdone buffoonery) ran for
upwards of a hundred nights, and is still a favourite piece.
MLLE. SchNEIDER as Helen is Pºlº scarcely so extravagant in her
vulgarity as in La Grande Duchesse, but there is all that excessive
imacing, continual adoption of a “cad”-tone (which her admirers
think so charmingly clever), that pointless introduction of rough horse-
play, hitting and icking, without which SchNEIDER would not be
SCHNEIDER. - -
The “cascader” song does not give her such an opportunity for
acting as did the “ Dites-lui,” and as there is no translation of it in the
book, (there is a weak adaptation incorporated with something else on
another page,) our English ladies, not understanding, follow the male
lead in their applause; I don’t, suppose they, know much about the
history of Jupiter and Laeda, which is delicately portrayed on the wall
of HELEN's chamber. Well, well, it was coldly received by a very warm
audience. Royalty was not there, and not many stopped to the end:
those who did, however, got ". feeble call for the great actress.
The costumes were dull. By the way, when classical dresses are
worn, is it not usual for French actors to adopt calecons & I was in the
stalls: need I say more ? The second Ajax was knocked by MLLE.
SchNEIDER right over a stool, heels uppermost.
Mijºs” was not equal to the rºle of Paris, he could not touch
the high note in his song about the three goddesses. Perhaps he was
suffering from cold; but he was much better in Fritz. The rest were
nowhere; except Örestes, who shone out as she did in hºanda by the
neat quiet . of her burlesque acting. I have alluded to the English
translation sold with the French j. it is what might be called
“humorous,” awakening a gentle feeling of pity in the reader's breast,
but lacking the genuine fun of the usual English libretto to a serious
Italian Opera.

So now I’ll sing a rummy lay of ancient Rome to you.

Now don't you fancy KICKERo looked very much like me }
(Spoken.)—Old KICKERo was a celebrated Lawyer, you know... I
y you’ve heard of KICKERo's Qffices. They wasn't in Lin-
coln's Inn; nor yet in the Temple of Jupiter, or any other divinity.
But never mind KICKERo. "Tis another ancient rum 'un I’m going to
tell you about— -
With my 'ic 'oc 'orum, unky dorum, asinus dum sto.
Did you ever see such a Guy as me, Quirites ? O ! Iol
your ||
Now listen to the story, what I’m § to relate,
I’ll take my arſ a David of the truth of all I state,
We 'ad at Rome, I tell you 'cause I don’t suppose you know,
A place we called the Forum, ”bove two thousand years ago.
(Spoken.)--Well; this Forum, you see, was an open space surrounded
with public buildins, like—I don’t know what you’ve got exactly—but
suppose I say Trafalgar Square—
With my 'ic 'oc 'orum, &c.
A wonder in the Forum did our minds one day astound,
The earth yawned rightasunder, and wide open gaped the ground;
We couldn't tell, how deep ’twas to the bottom of the 'ole,
Some said it 'ad no bottom; and they called it PLUTO's Bowl.
(Spoken.)—You’d have said Ancient Nicholas's Bowl. PLUTO, he
was the Ancient Nicholas of the ancient rum 'uns, but we didn’t fancy
he drank punch ; thought his tipple was nectar, 'cause we 'adn't got no
punch ourselves, either liquid or literary, in my young days–
With my 'ic oc orum, &c.
This 'orrid gulf we looked on with astonishment and fear,
As DR. CUMMING views a sign the end is drawin’ near;
And then it 'indered bisnis worse than ever you 'ad yours
With excavations made by the Commissioners of Sewers.
(Spoken.)—You see, we used to 'old public meetins in the Forum with
our BEALESEs and Potters in the Chair. There was situated our Ses-
sions Ouses and Palaces of Justice; so in course a great 'ole in the
middle of the Forum was a bore of uncommon dimensions to my
fellow-citizens and self—
With my 'ic 'oc 'orum, &c.
We sent and asked the oracle what course we should pursue,
The answer we got back was one that put us in a stew—
That 'ole will never close up, was the message brought us 'ome,
Till it has 'ad flung down if the most precious thing in Rome.
(Spoken.)—Now, in London I suppose you’d call that the Koh-i-Noor.
But we 'ada jewel among us that proved worth any diamond—a regular
Brick, as I may say—
- With my 'ic oc ’orum, &c.
“Now what, in all Rome's city of more value can there be
Than youth and arms and valour—a young swell, in short, like me?”
So said a cove who thirsted less for cooper than for fame,
One MARCUs CURTIUs, to pronounce his full and proper name.
(Spoken.)—Only, you see, we used generally to call him MARKCURTIs,
by way of abbreviation. f was in the abit of sayin that CURTIS was
a title of courtesy—
With my 'ic 'oc 'orum, &c.
“I’m in for it,” the ‘Ero cried, and few more words he spoke,
With which he put his armour on, and jumped across his moke,
And right into the Forum, amid all the people's cheers,
He rode the patient animal distinguished by his ears.
(Spoken.)—Some said there went a pair of 'em, and inquired which
was the biggest moke of the two. For my part, now, if you my
opinion, my answer is, I can't exactly say—
With my 'ic ’oc 'orum, &c.
They went together at the ‘ole, but down the moke did peep;
He didn't seem to see the fun of takin such a leap.
‘’It'im be ind,” said Curtius, and thereon exclaimed, “Here goes!”
So down they went, and over them the earth at once did close.
(Spoken.)—To the mingled 'orror and admiration of the be'olders.
The Patres Conscripti werry much applauded what he had done, and
on the strength of it took a boat and went to Philippi, where it formed
the leadin topic of their conversation. They called it an 'eroic act of
self-sacrifice and virtue as was its own reward, which may be quite
sufficient for some4. but decidedly not for Josephus, oh dear,
no; not for JoE. ccordingly, peraps you’ll excuse me if I venture
to improve the occasion—
With my 'ic 'oc 'orum, &c.,
and conclude with an appropriate
MoRAL.
Reflect on MARcus Curtius, gents, and let his early fate
Be an example to avoid and not to imitate;
Don't act with eyes wide open like that caution to young men,
'Tis easier gettin in a 'ole than gettin out again.

SHAFTESBURY TO THE RESCUE I
BRAvo, SHAFTESBURY | Fear not but Punch and JoHN BULL
You will find at your back for a long and strong pull,
From our Protestant pie to keep out the Pope’s paw,
And on Ritual rigs § the . of law.
Hold tight to your Bill that proclaims through the land,
That no monkey nor monkish tricks England will stand.
As for vestments, and incense, and lights and such stuff,
Let who want them seek Rome, where they’ll find quantum suff.
But we won't have Pope's work done by Anglican hands,
Nor in Protestant rope let 'em twist Popish strands.
Of the claims of the Church let the Ritualists jaw;
There’s but one Church of England—the Church of the Law
Let DENISON shudder at thought of a Church
Where priest high o'er layman has no right to perch.
He may prose and may prate, and declaim at his ease,
Of the charge to St. Peter, the power of the keys;
BUIL loves the old rule that no strange shaven poll
In English dominion shall tithe, tax, or toll.
And his Church is a Church that holds clergy and lay
Qne in eye of the Law both are bound to obey.
His Church has no sanction that Law does not bound,
His Church has no terrors that Law does not ground.
Sway or swag whence they list other churches º draw,
England's Church has one root and one refuge—the Law.
No miracle-mong’ring she needs or desires,
Simple service and seemly is all she requires.
'Tis enough in our clergy if models we see
In learning and life of what laymen should be.
# the lives that they lead more of power they will reach,
Than by titles they claim or by sermons they preach;
'Tis the man that makes sacred the office he bears,
Not the rites he performs or the vestment he wears.
These moppings and mowings, incensings and lights,
As mummeries are harmless, but serious as rites.
Who trust their hocus pocus had better withdraw
From the Old Church of England, the Church of the Law.
THE ROMAN CITIZENS AND THEIR BIG BROTHER.
Of course, Louis NAPOLEON, you observed the passage, following in
the address presented by the Roman, Committee to the KING of
PRUssLA, on the anniversary of the Battle of Sadowa:—
“The most ardent wish entertained this day by the Roman people is, that
under your wise guidance the noble, German .."º". fully attain its
object, and raise itself to that absolute greatness t does not envy the
development of other peoples, nor desire to oppose it.”
Is there a nation, think you, between which and the German a con-
trast is suggested in the words foregoing? Do you know of any nation
in Europe which has not raised itself to that pitch of greatness that
does not envy nor desire to º: the development of other Fº
No, you don't. It is a mistake to suppose that the French is that
nation. France is too generous to be such a nation as that. If she
appears to be so ignoble a nation, that appearance is simply owing to
the deplorable fact that her Government is forced to oppose the com-
§. of Italian unity by a groundless fear of the influence of an
ltramontane priesthood.
Only Natural.
THEY say that the War Office Clerks are in revolt against King
Storks. No wonder. They have been used to King Logs, and don't
want a change of dynasty.
Most LIKELY.--Is it because so many, Swells have “handles” to
their names that they are called “knobs?”

July 25, 1868] PUNCH, O
R THE
41
LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Mox DAY, July 14th. These Railways give a great deal of trouble.
Perhaps more than they are worth. Let us go back to the old Coach-
system. Parliament was never bothered about the Coaches. There
would be many advantages in this retrogression. People travel a great
deal too much, instead of staying at home minding their business and
saving their money. Women are always wantung to go somewhere.
Folks keep two residences, and spend half their time in unprofitably
running from one to another. There are many other evils connected
with Railroads, only it is too hot to think and remember. But it is
clear that the system is a failure. LoRD TAUNTON to-day proposed a
resolution that no Railway Bill, containing power to raise fares, should
be read a second time before a special report from the Board of Trade
that such increase was just and necessary. LoRD REDESDALE thought
that all Railways ought to be kept to their bargain with the public, and
he entirely objected to being guided by the Board of Trade, which was
motoriously under Railway influence. Lord SALISBURY (a chairman of
a company) thought the Railways ought to be treated generously.
We should particularly like to know why. Certainly not because they
show any generosity. A Company has as much human feeling as one of
its own buſiers. Some row was made in detence of the Board of Trade;
and LoRD TAUNTON (he used to be M. R. LABOUCHERE) carried his
motion. It will not do much good, but it is well to show what the
Lorus think of the Companies.
Mother Church was then finally destroyed for ever. At least, as
much was done to that end as can be effected by the passing of the Bill
for the Abolition of Church Rates. The Lords mended the measure,
and assented to it. We have not heard of the fall of any churches in
consequence, but when such catastrophes happen, Punch promises to
record them. Nevertheless, it is a fearful sign of the times, and if it
was not too hot to care about anything except iced drinks, we would
be terribly emphatic on the subject. When it is cooler, we will be
hotter. Meantime, Mother Church must do us the favour to believe
that we are awfully what-does-she-call-it about this proof that the
#: | Lords is atheistic, and that all religion is done away with in
Llgland.
Naval debates in the Commons, and it was clearly shown by the
Enemies of the Admiralty that all our ships are good for nothing.
First Lord ill, so LoRD HENRY LENNox had to defend the Admiralty,
and we honour his pluck, for he was so gouty that he had to speak with
his knee on a stool. He promised two turret-ships as soon as possible,
and more when the best designs could be obtained. We went into
supply, and supplied a great lot of naval money. It was very hot-we
mean the night; though the money might have been hot also, to the
burning of ſingers, to see the readiness with which it was dropped.
Tuesday. The Conservatives had intended to throw out the Bill for
letting Excisemen have votes, but MR. DISRAELI had ordered his col-
leagues to change their minds, and the LQRD CHANCELLOR ably advo-
cated a Bill which his associates in the Ministry had resisted in the
Commons. These little spectacles of consistency are now so common
that they cease–especially in this hot weather—to excite a smile. The
Exciseman is to have a vote, and we hope that he will make no mistake
in the exciseman of an election, but give his vote like a calm gauger.
If not, we shall sing, with BURNS,
“We'll mak' our maut, we'll brew our drink,
We'll dance, and sing, and rejoice, man,
And mony braw thanks to the muckle black deil
That danced awa’ wi' the Exciseman.”
The Commons, in Committee, discussed the Bribery Bill, and there
was a good deal of cavil at many of the clauses. Among other things
it was proposed that MESSRs. GURNEY, the short-hand writers to the
House, should not have the monopoly of taking official notes on election
trials. M.R. GLADSTONE emitted a great eulogy on the incomparable
way in which their work is done. No doubt they do it very well, but
there are scores of gentlemen in the gallery who can do it equally well.
The newspaper reports on an important night, when the crack steno-
graphers go to the front, deserve quite as much praise from M.R. GLAD- l
Besides, any machine of a man can take verbatim reports.
STONE.
The high class reporter is seen in the reports in which all is condensed,
and nothing worth note is omitted. No disparagement to MESSRs.
GURNEY, whose house has been famous since its representative, accord-
ing to LoRD BYRON, went to Madrid to take down the divorce pro-
ceedings in ALPHONso v. INEz AND ANOTHER. We wonder whether it is
as hot in Madrid as in London.
The Bill proposes to exclude a briber from Parliament for seven years.
This M.R. Powell declared to be a horrible punishment, taking from
a man all that was worth living for. We honour his affection for the
House of Commons, which no doubt returns it, but we think that there
him, said a wise thing. He could see no difference between bribery by
an agent and bribery with one's own hands. . Yet we can. The former
is the worse offence, as it makes three rascals instead of only two. A
tremendous majority, notwithstanding the hot weather, remained to
support the horrible punishment, which was enacted by 197 to 26.
This looks like earnest.
MR. CHILDERs showed that the Civil Service costs us about Twelve
Millions and a half a year, and is not done particularly well, either.
By the way, an odd result has arisen from our desire to have clever
men. We get them too clever. They pass examinations, and then
consider themselves superior to the work for which they have been
struggling. It is, however, only fair and just to the Civil Service to
say that though we have frequently been brought in contact with its
members, for official purposes, we never witnessed any particular supe-
riority of intellect. If the weather were not so hot, we would enumerate
a series of anecdotes illustrating this, but it shall suffice to say that
having, the other day, desired a Treasury clerk to make a champagne
cup, he came humbly up to us to know whether he should put in any
curaçoa.
On Secret Service Money, ALDERMAN Lusk, who aims at being a
successor of the late M R. W. WILLIAMS, and is, in the fact that he
comes a long way after him, wanted to know the use of Secret Service
when everything is published in the papers. It is too hot to be witty,
and we content ourselves with a hope that one thing will not be pu
lished in the papers, namely, ALDERMAN Lusk's re-election for Fins-
bury. We would introduce a compliment to his excellent colleague by
instituting a contrast, only his name reminds us of torrid, and that is not
an idea to be invited.
JWednesday. The Bill for interfering with the sale of poisons was dis-
cussed in Committee. LoRD ROBERT MONTAGU wished to be bound by
the suggestions of a farmer whom he named, but we don’t see why this
Farmer Sutical, or any other farmer, should dictate. There are some
good things in the Bill, and when it has passed we will get the Professor
whom we keep on the premises to analyse it, and report for the warning
of chemical and druggical men, which reminds us that, this hot weather,
the chemist with his cool bottle of soda-water fresh from his damp vaults
below is a sort of angel. But—
“O for a draught of vintage, that hath been
Cooled a long age in the deep delved earth '''
Thursday. The Lords held important discussion upon the endeavour
on the part of the Government authorities to make the proceedings of
SIR HENRY STORKs of none effect. The DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE spoke
out manfully for his gallant friend SIR HENRY, and hoped that he
would be allowed to complete all that he wished to do. The same sub-
ject was raised in the Commons, and SIR Joh N PAKINGTON was very
bumptious, but quite unable to remove the impression that the War
Office was divided, and that some superior power was hindering
reform. We shall get at it all in time. The lords then went away,
like gentlemen, at thirteen minutes to 8, just in time to dress for
ler.
But we shudder to say that the Commons kept the SPEAKER in his
chair, this hot weather, for fourteen hours and a half-that is, till 3 in
the morning. We have no heart to dwell on the details, beyond saying,
with approbation, that MR. DISRAELI declared that he could not advise
the Queen to prorogue until the Bribery Bill should be late. Well said,
Sir. The chief talk was of bullocks.
Friday. Dear LoRD REDESDALE, this Coronation Oath gives you
much trouble. You are a good Lord, and Punch will try to make it
easy for you. Suppose that, in exchange for the great glory and com-
fort of your being allowed to sit at the head of the table, when Punch's
Council meets, he made you take a tremendous oath, by Thor, Odin,
and Frigga, that the current volume of his work should always, lie
upon your dressing-table. Suppose that your housemaid objected that
the book was much in the way of your combs and brushes and Macassar
oil. You are bound to leave the book in its place. But would it not
be competent to Mr. Punch to say, “Never mind the old oath, REDDY,
know you honour the book—put it on the bookshelf.” Would you
be breaking your vow in doing so? Come, use the sense you apply to
railway matters, and take a cool drink.
The Commons declined to pay the judges £500 a year more for sitting
in Bribery. And in the debate MR. DiskAELI said that the Lords
used to have power to tax themselves, though they are now taxed by
the Commons. MR. GLADSTONE said that nothing but the whole
weight of MR. DISRAELI's authority could make him believe that. Mr.
Punch cannot understand MR. GLADSTONE's demurrer. Did not both
Houses sit together? /ide CoRE. And as for the Bishops, did not
Convocation tax itself, that is, the clergy MR. DISRAELI knows
history.
are one or two other things worſ, living for besides the honour of Mr. Flashwas, of Dover, petitions that Palestine may be restored
sitting in the same assembly with M.R. Powell. As has been well to the Jews. But, to say noting of Palestine not being Parliament's
asked, does nobody in the world except the 658 live for any worthy to give away (a trifle to a religious reformer) the session is too far
purpose? In the course of the debate, MR. Clay, as is common with advanced and too hot for the Restoration to be managed this year.

A CARD.
| Monday is the 27th of July. What imports the
nomination of this date? Simply this. On that
| date there will be performances at Covent Garden
Opera House for the benefit of MR. WILLIAM HAR-
| Rison, whose fortune was wrecked in his chivalrous
attempt to establish English Opera in England.
|Two classes Qught to give him their best support-
those who think we ought to have an English
Opera, and those who think that an honourable
artist who has fallen into undeserved trouble should
be assisted out of it. The bill is a very attractive
one, and (as Abel Drugger was told to bury a mag-
net to attract the spurs of the gallants towards his
shop) hope that under the portico of the Covent
Garden Opera House will be found the potent at-
traction of the pleasure of doing kindness to one
who has been deprived of wealth and health by his
exertions in aid of National Music. If MR. HARRI-
son has not a fine Benefit, we shall say that there is
more cant among musical people than we at present
believe that they talk. Monday, July the 27th.
OUR NAVAL ROLLING STOCK.
THE Admiralty has provided us with ironclads
deserving a name to match with that of SEELY's
pigs. In their course on a cruise they roll in a
manner which entitles them to be called REED's
porpoises. We are too little provided by land with
steam-rollers; and we have too many at sea: not
enough to crush stones; more than enough to cut
water. BRITANNIA did at one time rule the
waves; now she rolls them: and if she goes on
rolling them with broadsiders instead of turret-
ships much longer, they will very soon be ruled by
France or the United States, and even, Germany
may become more of their ruler than England.

Mr. Bumpy. But whether the judge or the magistrate is right about
which of 'em ought to admit MoTHER RAcHEL to bail, is a point that
should be settled for the sake of better people.
Mr. Grumpy. Unless LoRD JoHN iſºs soon turns the water
into the Regent's Park Lake, there will be a row... I wonder what that
ideous great pipe is for. The boats will run against it, and capsize–
that’s certain.
Mr. ; MR. HENRY MORLEY is an authority, and he seemsſto
have no doubt that those quaint verses which he has discovered are by
MILTON. But the Museum authorities say that the initials are not

horses this awful weather. [Cue for drink. . They drink.
Mr. Grumpy. I don't know. The patronage bestowed on MADE-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MRS. PUNCH*S, LETTERS TO HER. DAUGHTER.
Y DEAREST DAUGH-
TER,--I feel that I
should be ill pre-
aring you for the
attle of Life with-
out some practical
hints on the Choice
and Management of
a Husband ; for
though it is not in-
cumbent upon every
young woman to
marry at all, it is
highly necessary that
she should have her
mind made up upon
tant. First then, let
me tell you that your
dear. Papa, and I
are both of opinion
that the present sys-
tem of Husband-
hunting' which has
its laws and seasons
as well as otter or
fox-hunting, or any
other fashionable
- sport, is both ayulgar
error and a reprehensible custom; and curiously enough I was only yes-
terday lining my jam-cupboards with waste-paper when I came upon this
fragment of some old chronicle evidently written by one of our posterity.
“In the nineteenth century a curious and immodest fashion prevailed
among what were called the Upper Classes of this barbarous people. For
quite regularly in the pleasant spring-tide of the year, all the youngest
and fairest women, insufficiently, clothed but profusely, adorned, ran
races by gas-light in what was called the Matrimonial Curriculum, all
their mothers looking on and encouraging the game, by every con-
ceivable womanly wile and art. And those who ran best won divers
gº ; this one an Earl, that one a Baronet, a third only a Younger
on ; and many got no prizes at all, and as there were no other stakes
whatever to run for, left the Courses, sore dismayed.”
Oh, my dear! It does seem shocking that Posterity should have
such a bad opinion of us, doesn't it 2 but Mr. Punch views the matter
in precisely the same light, and Mr. Punch's Posterity must be right.
I hope and trust, however, that Posterity will not class me with those
ambitious and unmotherly mothers, as I am not ashamed to call myself
a person of only one or two ambitions, and those of most humble and
maternal kind.
I would have you especially take notice, my JUDIANA, that choosing
a husband is quite as important as choosing a dress, for the unsuit-
ability of the first is much more inconvenient than that of the last, and
the quality quite as much so. Be circumspect therefore, lest you allow
yourself to fall in love with a man on account of a delectable appear-
ance, of which he is pretty sure to be conscious—and, for worlds, do
not marry a handsome man. Good looks being quite as much of a
delusion and a snare to the one sex as the other, especially to the other.
For myself, I proclaim it on the house-tops, that }. proud to be the
wife of an ugly man. I should be proud to own an ugly son-in-law,
and if the world asks the reason, why, I can give it, chapter and verse.
An ugly man will most probably ſº been treated in a reasonable
manner by his mother, sisters, aunts, female cousins and friends. He
will not
women who have had the honour of ministering to him, he will not
have begun his career in life by taking it for granted that if he knew a
million nice girls, nine hundred thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
would take precisely his own view of the case, if he proposed to them.
Ah! it is a º piece of good fortune for a man to be hand-
some; he may be big, he may be little, he may be young, he may be
old, anything but that—till there are fewer foolish women in the world,
and then it would matter less.
I shall never live to see that golden age, my JUDIANA, though you
may do so, when a man who prides, himself upon his whiskers, his
waistcoats, and his knack of tº: drawing-room twaddle glibly, will
be all but an extinct species—as also the women who delighted to
honour him.
Having warned you against marrying a man with patented attrac-
tions, let me warn you against one or two other types to whom
it. Punch and your mother have objections quite as decided.
The Money-loving Tribe is quite as low in the scale of humanity as
the one just described, which may be called the Self-admiring tribe.
The latter cares for his wife and family because they are his belongings
and furniture, so to say; but then they must be common-place and

a subject so impor: |h
have been spoiled from his babyhood upward by all the &
vulgar to suit his fancy. He has no vanity, and plenty of contempt,
and entertains odious notions concerning Women’s Emancipation and
other intellectual topics. Have nothing to do with him.
* There is a particular race of clergy of mild exterior against whom I
urgently warn you; for I know not how it is but men of their profes-
sion are more prone to a sleek sort of self-assertion than any other;
and I never see a country rector issue from the vestry in his white
robes but I think how sick his poor wife must grow of that stagnant
self-satisfaction which neither she, nor refractory dissenters, nor in-
croaching dissenters can for a moment distrust. Such men are quite
unimprovable, and terribly dull company. Marry no man, though he
were an angel, who is your junior by ever so few years or months.
Women, my daughter, are much too prone to command, and assuming
the equality of the sexes, humanly considered, no man has a right to
put himself in this position of inferiority.
Marry a man double your age, if you don’t mind it.
Marry a wise man if he be ugly as AEsop : of any profession: but do
not marry an ass, although he may have the look of an Apollo. Of
such Apollos there are not a few, and they are sure to give a warning
ray.
Between a spendthrift and a money-hunter choose neither. Pursue
the same course with men who spend their time in toys, trifles, and
unproductive conversation.
Marry no man who will not subscribe to these Articles in a satisfac-
tory manner to yourself:—
Do you believe in MR. MILL, and in his notions concerning women?
Are you prepared to sign any document concerning the legal claims
of women to the Franchise, Universities, Professorships, the Medical
Curriculum, efcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera,
efrefera, etcetera, including the entire and arbitrary disposal of their
husbands' income? -
To you hold women to be superior to men, and men to be horrid
selfish creatures, preferring clubs, papers, and cigars, to the delights
of tea and home conversation?
Will you engage never to interfere with vour wife in her choice of a
church, and to admire the sermons of her favourite preachers; also to
subscribe handsomely for Easter decorations, presentation gowns, &c. *
Will you promise never to shelter vourself from reasonable expenses
under the plea of “Limited Income.”
Lastly, will you take an oath to see everything exactly from that
point of view that your wife desires 2
Having caught your hare next proceed to skin him, the old cookery
book says; so having chosen your husband, next begin to break him
in, mv JUDIANA. Far be it from Mrs. Punch to come before the world
as a Female Rarey, and yet has not Mr. Punch himself gone through a
mild process of taming * For, if we unfortunate women who are so
shamefully enslaved by the laws of our country had no moral weapons
where with to defend ourselves, we should be in worse plight than the
squaws of barbarons tribes. Thank the happy Fates, therefore, that
you are blessed with a tongue, a fountain of tears, and an implacable
memory. An ordinary domestic tyrant may be kept perfectly tractable
by the cunning use of the first appliance, an extraordinary one is tamed
with the second, and the most incorrigible despot going cannot stand
the third. For instance, your husband is sulkv when asked to take
you to Switzerland, or to buy you a new piano—but you can remember
a thousand things he said once upon a time—in the Spooning season,
as Courtship is vulgarly called—bearing upon foreign trips, or pianos,
or anything you fancied, when you were an angel. Recall these things,
omitting neither dates, nor interesting geographical or atmospheric facts.
Such, for instance, as “How we strayed from the others at the pic-nic,
and it rained, and we stood under a tree,” &c., &c., &c., or, “How we
staved at such or such a place in North Wales on our wedding tour,
and there was a horrid cracked piano, and you said, -oh, that men
should be so depraved —you said, that I should have a Broadwood,”
C., &c.
Take heed that you use your memory discreetly, my daughter, and
wou will never find your husband more than you can fairly battle with.
Never forget to remind him in season how often he goes to the Club,
how seldom he takes you to the Opera, what he spends on his own
pleasures, what he ought to spend on yours. What selfish creatures
men are, and what a mistake marriage is. Obey these instructions,
and you will have every reason to bless your mother,
MRs. PUNCH.
Recreations of Fontainebleau.
IN a column of gossip about Court Life at Fontainebleau, the Paris
correspondent of the Post says: —
“The visit of the new librarian of the Palace of Fontainebleau frequently
imparts a literary character to the Court soirées. At a recent réunion of this
kind, M. FEUILLET read to their Majesties several chapters of a romance
which he is now finishing.”
Whereon the PRINCE IMPERIAL may perhaps have taken occasion to
say, “Hear M. FEUILLET reading Papa and Mamma his fevilleton.”

DEAR BROTHER PUNCH,-Rather a good idea of
Brºther WILDE's letting us take off our wigs in Court;
eh? What we might term an unexpected “refresher.’
Yours without prejudice,
R. ARTHUR PoRUs.
--
Poetry or Doggerel ?
MR. PUNCH,--Has not too much importance been
attached to the fact, as an argument showing the Poem
ascribed to MILTON not to be MILTON's, that the initials
appended to it are P. M. instead of J. M. P. May not
. M., Sir, be su 1. to stand for PoET MILTON ?
If the letters h n, P.C. would many of us have
doubted them to mean PoET CLose? I venture to sign
myself, Hotspur.
MAJOR PALLISER'S HEAVY CHARGES.
. My eye, Mr., Punch, was caught the other day by the following
jocular paragraph in a newspaper:—
“Mason PALLISER's GUN.—It may ease the minds of tax-payers if they
are informed that the gun which burst at Shoeburyness on Thursday, as well
as the powder and shot, was MAJon PALLISER's private property, and that no
expenditure of public money has been incurred. The gun in question is one
of a purely experimental nature, and steel was tried only in consequence of
the great pressure put on MAJoR PALLISER to give that metal a trial.”
The writer of the foregoing statement could never have intended
seriously to express an opinion that tax-payers would be glad and not
sorry that the cost of an accident incurred by a gentleman in tryin
experiments for their advantage would have to be borne by him, an
not by themselves. . For an individual alone that cost would be heavy;
a share of it for each one of a multitude would be light, and if the tax-
payers would rather MAJoR PALLISER should stand it than they, their
meanness would be ridiculous. Does not the British Public always
make a point of compensating every one who loses either money, life,
or limb in its service, by the award of a handsome grant or pension to
or his survivors? Generous British Hºf. it takes nothing
for nothing; never allows anybody to sacrifice anything for it without
being amply remunerated
If MAJok PALLISER has lost anything by the bursting of his gun, of
course Government will take care to see that he is reimbursed. Other-
wise it will not go the way to get clever men to devote their abilities
to the improvement of our artillery. Your humble Servant
EGOMET IPSE.
SCIENTIFIC EVENING DRESS.
“Why,” says the Lancet to its readers, “do not the members of
our profession set a good example by clothing themselves in a rational
manner during the present weather? Our medical contemporary pro-
ceeds to explain that the elements of a rational costume are porousness
and whiteness of material, rendering it a non-conductor, a sparing absor-
bent, and plentiful reflector of heat, and allowing evaporation from the
surface of the body. The Lancet states that:-
“These qualities are possessed in the highest degree by white flannel, and
there is no reason that we can find why this material should not be adopted
: in place of the atrocious costume which fashion inflicts upon suffering
mankind.”
Fashion with regard to colour and caloric, is even more unscientific
as touching male attire than female. It requires men toM. themselves
into suits of black when they go to dance in crowded ballrooms. The
consequence, the least injurious, is liquefaction. For waltzing in such
weather as we have lately had, he only fit attire would resemble the
uniform in which recruits are Men should wear a fatigue
dress-coat, waistcoat and trowsers, made, as the Lancet suggests, of
white flannel. It might, if needful, be picked out and trimmed narrowly
with pink, or scarlet, or sky-blue, or any other. tint suitable to the
tomfoolery of capering, and satisfactory to the ladies.
Don't Mention the Place.
THE Eisteddfod this year is to be held at Ruthin. Reporters be
pitiless: let there be noruth in what you say of that grotesque meeting.

Y DEAR CHILD,-At this season of the year, when
those who can afford it leave the green nooks of England, and fly from one - - -
end of the Continent to the ...: with enjoyment exactly proportionate to the county families, and an excited section of the ladies residin
the expenditure, it may be as well to give you my thoughts on Travel.
Your, Father has little inclination for the favourite British sport of riding a
steeple-chace across, Europe, with the cream of one's country-people, in
the dog-days; but shall his wife and daughter on that account be deprived
of pleasure ? Never, never—so pack up your finest clothes, my Jupi ANA,
buy the biggest chignon you can get, and with maid, courier, and boy in
buttons, let us set ofonour travels.
Do you ask whither we go? Naire, Miss Punch / As if it mattered in
the least so long as we find plenty of fine ladies and gentlemen there, and
if a baronet and his lady, or an Honourable Miss Came-in-with-the-Con-
queror, will not the place be a Paradise of the first water? -
Formerly, I confess, people used to travel for the sake of studying fo-
reigners, and the ways of foreigners. My Grandfather took his family
from one end of France to the other in a private coach-and-four, and they
what education they had, and so on. But the fashion is wholly altered
now, and you and I must submit to being whirled from Calais to Paris in
crowded carriages till our limbs are agonised with cramp, and our brains
dizzy, and our senses—nowhere: and not grumble, because the Grand Hôtel
du Louvre is like an Inferno this hot weather, peopled with those polyglot
imps in black swallow-tail coats, the waiters, poor wretches! -
or, why should we grumble indeed, because we are whirled on in the
same way to Geneva, ini perhaps farther, window-blinds down all the time,
carriage packed to the last inch with rugs and bags, and no fellow-travel-
lers but English, who are frigid and unyielding as to elbow-room, as the
locomotive Englishman or Englishwoman is sure to be. We stop some-
4th. Travel is an admirable method of giving one's daughters
what may be called an Opportunity.
5th. Travel is an admirable field for flirts of both sexes.
6th. Travel is the fashion.
T. These are a few of the reasons why people should travel,
though their name is Legion.
If a foreign tour à la mode, is a probation to fathers andmothers,
it is some recompense to have got one's eldest daughter engaged,
to have made the acquaintance of old LADY BIGNAME and her
inestimable JEAMses, to have one's sons lolling about cafés, and
losing money at cards with that young LoRD FITzvagabond—
(what matters it how a lord behaves?) to have screwed down
the domestic staff at home to the minimum of board wages, and
the hotel-keeper to the minimum of Pension prices, so retrieving
the extrayagance of the London season.
And then for mothers, there is the especial gratification of
seeing how sweet their girls look in rechauffé toilettes, and how
much admiration they get!. Dressed in the flimsiest, flashiest
style, ribbons streaming, chignons, a miracle 1 and abundantly
using the liberty allowed them, what an astounding impression
our young ladies must create upon the minds of foreigners. The
manners of that portion of our sex are so perplexing, that I am
afraid we have things said of us that are far º: true,
and no wonder.
Prepare for your travels, therefore, my child, for it is highly
desirous that you should go abroad and see what your country-
ople are like. We will go, and conquer. Perhaps the º
ates may lead us to some Swiss Arcadia, where the Ranz des
Paches is heard on the heights, and the glaciers shine in the
sun, and the pine-woods are green—and the Upper Ten Thousand
of our adored country most do congregate. "Let us take with
us an abundant and fashionable toilette, a courier glib of speech,
and of immaculate honesty, our maid for comfort, and our But-
tons, for the look of the thing—and how will hotel-keepers and
waiters bow down before us. -
Oh! for a flunkey—but that is a dream of Elysium in which I
dare not indulge. Let us be thankful for the Buttons, and tell
nobody that he is a newspaper boy hired for the occasion.
Your ambitious Mamma,
MRs. PUNCH.
THE CHURCH IN DANGER.
THE following are a few of the alarming and disastrous cala-
mities which a large proportion of the Peerage, the clergy, and
- g
in market-towns and rural districts are confident will be the
certain result of the Disestablishment of the Irish Church:-
Scarcity of Foxes,
Stoppage of Banks,
An inferior º of Sherry (bad enough already),
Decay of County Balls,
Increased consumption of Tobacco,
Demoralisation of Curates,
Alarming spread of Poaching,
Indifference to the office of Rural Dean,
Decline of Croquet,
General neglect of Gloves,
Disease amongst Grouse,
Servants more and more independent,
No Railway Dividends,
Black Beetles,
The Fires of Smithfield
Disuse of Powder by Male Domestics,
Cheap Claret,
Short Sermons,
The elevation of MR. BRIGHT to the Peerage, and
The Setting of England's Sun for Ever.
Racy Bit of Foreign News.
where and eat nothing, and thus gaining heaps of new experiences and
information, cattle on to our journey's end.
“Why do people travel, then ** asks my ingenuous JUDIANA * There
are a hundred reasons why, all cogent and plain enough to be understood
by a mind as innocent in the ways of the world, as that of Miss Punch.
1st. Travel is the best means of studying the manners and customs of
the English. -
2nd. Travel is the best means of making acquaintances of superior rank
to our own.
3rd. Travel may be recommended to those who “from circumstances over
which they have no control,” cannot stay in their own country.
CAR-CANADE.
A week or so back, a rather novel race took place between a
One-Horse Car and a Velocipede; the former was driven by a
Monsieur CAR-RERE, and the latter propelled by a Monsieur
Comical names under the circumstances. They
started frºm Castres—it ought to have been Cartres—but it
wasn't. Their destination was Toulouse, though their object was
to win. However, the gentleman with the horse came in first.
A spectator, who had recently seen Mazeppa, was so impressed
with the rapidity of the winner, that he shouted out, in the lan-
guage of the soul-stirring drama in question,
“Again he urges on his wild CARRERE!”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ODD MEN OUT.
PREFACE. –1. THE MAN WITH AN EAR.
It was a toss up whether. I should put them into the photograph
book of “A Few Friends,” but I decided upon making them into a
collection of the Odd Men Out.
Happy Thought.—To call them Heads and Tales, i.e., Sketch the head
and then write the tale. -
But this idea was immediately abandoned, as among the first in the
collection came - -
The Headless Man; that is, The Man without a Head on his
shoulders. -
After him comes another portrait, of whom you will hear as The
Man with a head on his shoulders.
The other Portraits are—
The Man with an Ear.
The Man with a Nose.
The Man with an Eye.
The Man with a Palate.
The Man with a Voice.
The Man with No Woice.
Leaving the Man with a Head and the Headless Man for the present,
we will come to the Man with an Ear. -
There is a Man with an Ear who knows how to play some instrument
and plays it, as he says, merely for his own amusement, which however
does not prevent him from treating you to a private performance when
you º: allow yourself to get with him alone for five minutes in his
own room. He doth, as it were, ravish you with sweet sounds when
he getteth you into his net. With this ear of his he does wonderful
things. He uses it as an elephant does his for the purposes of
picking up. There is the Man with an Ear who does not play upon an
instrument; and the Man with an Ear who does. - -
I met Biiscombe (one of the former division) standing in the street
in an attitude of the deepest attention. I salute him. . .
“Ssh!” says BILscombe. I look about to see what is the cause of
this mystery.
“Ssh!” says he again, apparently feeling that some sort of explana-
tion is perhaps necessary. “I want to catch something.” .
If by any chance my practical-joking friend, GRIGG, is with me, he
will pretend that what É. wants to catch is a fly or a flea, and
disturb him gently by pretending to hunt it on his coat-collar.
“Ah!” says BILscom BE, with a sigh of annoyance, “they’ve
finished. Bother l’”
been listening to as much as he could catch of the strains of a German
Band, performing selections from something or other round the corner
of the next street. -
“I wonder what that tune was,” he says more to himself than me,
as we walk on.
To humour him I inquire what tune; but this was before I knew
BILscom BE well.
“Well,” says he, “it goes like this;” whereupon he stops suddenly,
it may be in the middle of Regent Street, he doesn’t care, and standing
j, opposite me, he directs an imaginary band with a short stick,
much after the impulsive manner of the late M. JULLIEN, while the
part of the imaginary orchestra is filled by his mouth and nose to-
gether (mouth shut, nose open, like an organ with two pipes), which
under the direction of the stick, perform a solo of this sort, time a
little uncertain, say two four to begin with, and four and a half when
in doubt, “Rum dum a dum dum dum dum dum, dum, dum dummy
dum dum dirum di-”
I tell him I don’t know it, and propose moving.
“No, no,” says BILsco MBE, “that part's all right: here’s the
jºy :—doodle loodle rum adum doo and—then, how does it go
then P’’
“I really don’t know,” I answer.
“You’re the tenth man I’ve asked to-day who doesn’t know,” he
exclaims, almost angrily.
“Why does he want to get hold of this tune so particularly P"
It appears from BILscombe's modest confession that he is the colla-
borateur of a friend (under the assumed name of well never mind
what) who writes those amusing pieces in which a considerable element
of success is either the judicious adaptation of the popular melodies of
the day, or the careful introduction of such novelties as shall become

IRISH PROTESTANT BOYHOOD.
THE Dublin Correspondent of the Post, the other day, announcing a
|Protestant demonstration to come off under the presidency of the
EARL OF ENNISKILLEN, said :—
“A placard has been posted throughout the County Fermanagh stating
that the EARL of ENNISRILLEN ‘hopes and expects every Protestant, from
fourteen to sixteen years of age, will be at his post on that day, to enter his
rotest against the meditated attacks upon the Established Church and the
'rotestant Constitution by the enemies of both.”
The meeting of Protestants thus convoked, in view of the conditions
of age prescribed for those invited to attend it, seems to have been
º to be a demonstration of Protestant boys who would be boys
lindeed.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
SATURDAY, July 18th. It is 'all very well to beg that Members will
not put unpleasant questions, to the delay of public business, but when
thousands of pounds are being spent on Target experiments, the tax:
payer is rather inclined to ask about results. MR. O'BERNE insisted
on poking a question at SIR John PAKINGTON, and in fº it
answered, and the answer showed, as LoRD ELCHO observed—and he
has studied the subject—that the sort of forts we are building at Ply:
mouth, at £35,000 a-piece, are good for very little. Mr. Punch inspected
one of the Plymouth forts last year, to the extent of looking at it as he
smoked his cigar on the Breakwater, and asking the boatman whether
it was an ice-house, and therefore he is P. competent to give
judgment, which is that a French ironclad would knock it to pieces
fore a Flymouth Brother could row off and tell the invader to go
a

º: then debated the Bribery Bill, and twice carried, mark you, an
amendment by MR. FAwcETT for throwing the lawful expense of elect
tions on the county and borough rates. MR. ALDERMAN, LUsk did
not speak in support of the clause, which was virtuous self-denial, as
his own outlay, at the last Finsbury election, was £6,143 lls. 11d., and conduct in respect to the Lake.

silent as one of the Elgin marbles which he “doesn’t think so much of.”
Monday. Debate in the Lords on the Public Schools Bill, and LoRD
MALMEsbu Ry emitted two propositions: one, that it was not necessary
to teach the modern languages at Public Schools, as parents could easily
have them taught by engaging foreign Nurses for their young gentle-
men; and the other, that the Holidays given at school are a great deal
too long, and cause youths to forget much which they have been

College has some bad drainage which must be amended. The Baptists
are a very objectionable sect, both in Jamaica and England, and we
have a great mind to put them down, only that we love MR. SPURGEoN.

Asked whether he meant, as was rumoured, to knock MR. FAw-
cºrr's Amendment out of the Bribery Bill, the PREMIER gave sharp
answers, stating that he always behayed in a highly superior manner,
and gave notice of what he meant to do. The upshot was, that on the
following night notice to the above effect was given, and on the Thurs-
day the Government induced the House to upset the Amendment by
115 to 97, whereby there was much storming. Also two other pro:
posals were made; one, that every candidate should deposit £100, and
the other, that any candidate not getting a fifth of the votes, should
y his share of Election expenses. The House rejected both, and
ter in the week again defeated MR. FAwcETT. -
Women, and other men who steal flowers from public parks and
gardens, should know that there is an Act under which they can be
committed and punished. A Magistrate's having recently overlooked
the fact, and let a flower-thief off, may lead other selfish persons into
mistakes, with disagreeable results. -
We had a jolly Irish row over the proposal that local Irish beaks
should have power to alter polling-places. Everything connected with
that delightful country has a party bearing, and the object of this pro:
posal was to enable the landlords, to drag their tenants to the poll
without rescue by the priest and his mob. The Priest Party was as
sharp as the Landlords, and a good fight took place, ending in the
defeat of the Government and the Clause by 84 to 74, an
MAYo flung up a º slice of the Irish Registration Bill.
Then, thanks to t -
Cattle Bill." This was for preventing foreign cattle from º; into
London. It was proposed that only the British Meatmonger should have
the right to sendſ his articles to town; the alien beasts were to be taken
to a distant market somewhere down the Thames. The pretended
reason for the vehement support given to this Bill by the landlord
interest is fear of the Cattle Disease; the real reason is, that it was a
LoRD
Protectionist measure, tending to raise the price of food. The Liberals
fought hard against it, moving adjournment after adjournment, and
being stormed at by the Colonels and such like. But it was beaten
out at three in the morning; and the next time it came on, by appoint-
ment, MR. AYRTON snapped a Count Out, scarcely fairly, but pardon-
able in the circumstances. º on Saturday morning, the Govern-
ment, wearied out, threw up the Bill.
Tuesday. The Electric Telegraphs Bill went through Committee. It
was abused by a few Members, and MR. PHILLIPs, Liberal Member for
Bury, objected to it, as only for the benefit of merchants, lawyers, and

betting-men. Merchants may not be altogether an insignificant class
in this country, and lawyers manage much of our business for us. We

But many other º: want the telegraph. Mr. Punch him-
self uses it freely, and his despatch, “Hooray, Bumpy, Lumpy says

and demands as much care in the transmission. The Bill, with much
honour and glory to MR. Scuda MoRE, has passed the Commons.
It has been read twice in the Lords.
Something really ought to be done to satisfy the Catholics on a matter
about which they make such a botheration that it is clear they think it
of importance. Papist, paupers and criminals ought to be allowed full

of being converted to Protestantism and virtue together. Guardians

MR. MILL tried to obtain an enactment forbidding the employment
of paid agents at Elections. He was elected gratuitously, to the
ke of himself and Westminster. But there were other
Members who had not deserved such a distinction, and they shuddered
at the danger of offending those whom such a Clause would hit. It
was rejected by 116 to 86.
All the Ministers, except LoRD STANLEY, ate the Whitebait dinner,
and, we hope, enjoyed a Banquet which perhaps they may not repeat.

Mr. Punch leaves the former allegation to the treatment of enunciated the very wise doctrine that the Head Master should be as
autocratic as possible, and not be shown to the boys as under the
Sway of a Committee. It is true that a wise Committee will seldom

with all government and responsibility; but all Committees, even of
individ wise men, are not wise. Decidedly, boys should be under
a just and benignant despot, whose diri should'be final.
India must wait till next year for Legislation. The Government
Bills were withdrawn. Panch has already recorded, the other cata-
strophes of the day, which, by the way, was a good deal cooler than any
day for a month.
Friday, We never knew the House of Commons behave worse.
Everybody seemed desirous to say or do something that ought not to
be done or said. It will hardly be believed that MR. MILNER GIBson,
who is the archetype of goodnature, and whose smile when, as a
Minister, he used to seem to be answering questions, would have dis-
armed a savage—he who was always as busya honey-maker as the Bee
in the Epitaph which MILTON, DID NOT write—he was in a passion
the whole evening, and wanted words to be taken down, and had to be
called to order. hen he could stray, what wonder that others erred,

“faction,” had to apologise, that MR. AYRTON was not going to be

There was a general disposition to make rows, and the only two good

any knowledge or patronage of the low cad, FINLEN, who intruded on
him with a deputation (and who leaves his own children in a condition

The place which the º gooseberry generally occupies in the
newspapers has this year been taken by mosquitoes, which are said to
have turned up, if with truth certainly in season, during, the late
tropical weather. A Correspondent .# the Times declared that he
heard one of these insects make a noise which he described as boom,
oom, oom-the sort of hum peculiar to the mosquito. There is another
insect, too common in some beds, which is altogether silent, and yet
its name is associated, in a vernacular expression, with hum. It is not
the flea, We shall soon know whether the boom, oom, oom of the
supposed mosquito was a genuine hum, or mere hum in connection
with the word which, per se, is the name of that other insect.

DISRAELI’S WEEK OF CRIME.
(From the Morning Star.)
Monday. The ant but artful PREMIER declared that the weather
was almost too hot for anything. This was a characteristic hint to
the representatives of the nation to go away from the House, and leave
him to control the destinies of the country. It was not taken.
Later, MR. DisRAELI said that he did not think it was quite so hot.
We cannot speak calmly of such inconsistency, yet what else can be
expected of the Tory author of a Reform
R. DISRAELI ... LoRD John MANNERs what the opera of that
Irish fellow-citizens, those of whom, only thirty-two years ago, he wrote,
“This wild, reckless, insolent, uncertain, and superstitious race have
nq. sympathy with the English character. Their fair ideal of human
felicity is an alternation of clannish broils and coarse idolatry.”
Wednesday. We do not often allude to private matters, but MR.
DisBAELI's conduct this day was too offensive to be overlooked. He
was seen standing in his balcony at Grosvenor Gate, and pointing out
to a º the new railings of the Park. On his lip i. the bitter
smile which he was too cunning to allow to be seen, but it may easily
be . that he was expressing hatred for the people who had
made those new railings necessary. At least, if he were not, will he
stand up at the table, and manfully explain what he was saying to the
night was. Would MR. GLADs.TQNR have asked such a question while lady?
the responsibilities of office weighed upon him? But MR. DISRAELI
was ever a trifler. -
Going home at night, MR. DisRAELI said that he should walk; , Yes;
it is certain that he is not the man to hasten home, and betake himself
to the study of blue-books and national questions. We believe that he
went basely to bed.
Tuesday. Meeting MR, WARD HUNT in the lobby, the PREMIER was
heard to observe ãº he hoped the white-bait were good. He was
thinking of the Ministerial dinner next day? When did he think of
* but of the advantages of office?
he #: observing a Liberal Member who had, crossed the
House, seated near him, asked him whether it was cooler “overthere,”

§ not deserve the playful answer which it received, and we regret
that one who professes to be of the people, had no more earnest and
worthy reply than, “Yes, you know, we’re out in the cold.” -
MR. DisrAELI in the most bare-faced manner ate an Orange º

indecent symptom of sympathy with the tyrannical faction was perhaps
never manifested. And this is the man who affects to care for his

of ours. But in due time they will discover on what sort of viands

shes while they may. Delendus est DISRAELI
Thursday. MR. DisRAELI laughed to SIR John PAKINGTON in a
peculiar manner on taking his seat in the House. Evidently there
was some reminiscence of the Banquet of the previous night. Now
we put it to MR. DISRAELI, who has talents above those of the Roys-
Tons and the tipsy Colonels, whether some show of gravity does not
befit the Minister even of a Minority?
Well, indeed, might the PREMIER look as grave as he did at the
ominous termination of this day's proceedings. There was matter for
gravity in his meditations, but he had no right to manifest upon his
countenance the displeasure which he felt. The House of Commons
is not to be brow-beaten by a man whom it once refused to hear, and
to whom it would have been well had attention never been accorded.

FAwcETT, the PREMIER’s umbrella might, perhaps have been service- bar, that the example would be generally followed, and that the profession
able, yet even that would not have repelled the tempest. would soon see an end of the wig.”—Law Report of Friday.
It is the PREMIER’s habit to close his eyes during the speech of an
opponent. This we consider a treacherous advantage, as it deprives
an antagonist of the means of seeing the full effect which his arguments
may be producing. But it is part of MR. DisRAELI's nature to be
tricky in all things.
The mode in which MR. Disraeli watched every glance and gesture
of MR. GLApstone during the latter's majestic speech of last night,
was in itself no doubt intended to be offensive, but it was really the
highest compliment which the orator could receive. It was the reverse
of what is seen in nature. The Serpent was fascinated by the Man.
But this did not make the stare less Disraelish, that is, less rude.
Saturday. Not much was done in the House, but we could not hel

THE WEATHER.
MAN could not stand boots, so took
to pumps and hose. Ladies wore
silks, . but only those that were
watered, or glacé. The Meteoro-
logical Report in the papers became
unexpectedly popular, and to read
about the wet bulb was delicious.
(Where are Greencastle, Helder,
and Skudesmaes?) There was moré
barometrical pressure than is gene-
rally supposed, for people were con-
stantly tapping the weather-glass.
Many persons went out of town to
the nearest watering-place; those
who couldn't, made for the next
drinking-fountain.., Nobody cared
for any music but the Coldstream’s.
The Park and Piccadilly were com-
letely deserted for Brook Street,
onduit Street, Wells, Street,
#" ond Street, and Snow
Hill. ow ungrateful we are
The barometer was “corrected,” and the thermometer exposed—to
most unpleasant remarks. The heat completel upset Mrs. Malaprop:
she talked about the weather being one of the chief tropics of conversa:
tion, admitted she was of a warm temperature, and said she understood
that the temperament was the highest ever known in England. The
advice of the late SIR Robert PEEL was never before so extensively
followed on the summer eve of a general election, for everybody made
it his business to “register, register, register”—the heat. Warm dis-
cussions arose about the exact geographical position of Wenham Lake:
some said Norway, others Iceland; *. minority held to
America—but America’s a large district: , People were variously
affected—some were knocked up, others pulled down.
Photographers did a great sunstroke of business. Everybody knew
an authority who had just returned from Barbadoes, or Bengal, or
Mauritius, and declared it was cool there by comparison. Great re-
joicing when the weather became a shade better." Bets freely made
that after three days’ moderate temperature people would begin to
grumble about the cold, and the summer being gone, &c. The wonder
was that Parliament was not dissolved, but who could have stood a
hotly-contested election, unless it had been for an Iceburgh P
Undeniable.
SoME of ourcontemporaries have recently published some interesting

Time was when a man with a handle
To his name found his way plain and clear,
When no service had witnessed the scandal
Of Plebeian allowed to pass Peer.
Now to service and purse of the nation,--
Be access to backstairs what it may—
Through Competitive Examination
Swells and snobs must alike make their way:
While Rank with Low-birth’s on a par,
And none asks if you're Tory or Whig,
Methinks, beyond pale of the Bar
We may soon “see an end of the wig.”
In the House there is less faith in Bum BLE:
To Red-tape we no longer vote thanks:
In the Army at purchase they grumble,
Talk of raising good men from the ranks:
And elections, at last, circumscribing,
Of their º hard-worked agents #y 'd chouse :
And on M.P.'s found guilty of bribing,
For sev’n years shut the door of the House !
Yes—the times very ominous are,
For old ways few or none care a fig–
In more callings, I fear, than the Bar,
We may soon “see an end of the wig.”

º #. to be suggested by the very
THE need of a public -
to the s concerned in an outrage thus
mild justice administere
described by the Times:—
“NEARLY A MURDER.—An atrocious case of assault was heard at Malton on
Saturday before a full Bench of magistrates. The gross nature of the case
caused the court to be crowded. Four men, named THoMAs Potter, W.
Potter, and W. SHARP, labourers, of Terrington, and THoMAs GooDALL
groom, of Wigganthorpe, were charged with assaulting a young man, name
John Swann, a tailor, of Slingsby, in Hovingham, on the 14th inst., between
ten and eleven o'clock at night. GooDALL only pleaded “Not Guilty.' From
the evidence of a gentleman named SEDGwick, of Hovingham, who witnessed
the latter part of the affray from his bedroom window, and whose appearance
appeared to have saved the life of the . the four men, seemingly
without provocation, most cruelly ill-treated the man Swan N, got him down,
and kicked him until senseless.”
When, in such a case as this, the accused are not committed for trial,
the obvious supposition is, that their victim preferred to have it sum-
marily settled. That, in some measure, enables us to account for the
apparent leniency shown by the Malton magistrates to the above-named
criminals. The Times continues:–
“The walls of MR. SEDGwick's house and the pavement are yet covered
with blood, the heavy rains having failed to obliterate it. MR. SEDGwick
did not hesitate to say that if not interfered with, the men must have murdered
the complainant, and some of the magistrates expressed a similar opinion.
With the exception of GooDALL, who said he took no part beyond holding the
coats of two of the others, the men made no defence. The Bench were unani-
mous in fining the defendants heavily, and imposed a penalty of £10, costs
included. Three of the men paid their proportion, the fourth to pay in three
weeks, or two months' hard labour.”
Who can doubt that, if these fellows had killed the man on whom
they committed the assault attested by MR. SEDGwick, they would
have committed quite a murder, and be the first to get hanged
in private? The crime they did commit deserved penal servitude for
life, and if they were let off with a fine of £2 10s. each, or the option
of two months’ hard labour, surely it was but because they were sen-
tenced to the heaviest punishment that the Bench had power to inflict.
“The Bench were unanimous in fining the defendants heavily.”. Of
course, that means as heavily as they could. Only, what needs a little
explanation is the statement that one of these brutes, to whom imme-
diate ...; was inconvenient, had three weeks’ credit given to
him ins of having been immediately sent to gaol. We do not blind
ourselves to the fact that John Swans, the sufferer of their maltreat-
ment, was a tailor; but we dismiss, the suggestion that the Malton
Bench regarded the injuries which he sustained as bearing a relative
}. to merely the ninth part of a man. But, anyhow, a Public
rosecutor is wanted to take perpetrators of atrocious assaults out of
such hands as theirs, and send them to the Assizes, where a judge will
have the authority, as well as the intelligence, to visit them with a
punishment not absolutely ridiculous.
ANGLO-AMERICAN JURIES.
# DeNYING.. that the American Government has any just reason to
complain of the treatment of captured Fenians, who were naturalised
Irishmen, the Times explains that :—
“The form in which the doctrine of immutable allegiance appeared was the
refusal of a jury de medietate lingua: ; for if a prisoner could not satisfy the
Court that lie was an American born, his claim to a mixed jury was rejected.”
It is difficult to see, how, in the case even, of an acknowledged
American citizen, it would be possible to empanel a jury de medietate
linguae. The English language is the English language. All Americans
claim, as they say, to talk good English; and some do. As to lan €,
a mixed jury of Americans and English would be six of one and half-a-
dozen of the same.
Scarcely Likely.
In the news brought by the West India Mail we read that the
“agent general of immigration has arrived en route for India to engage
coolie labourers for Jamaica.” We hope he will succeed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
SATURDAY, July 25th. That Foreign Cattle Market Bill was aban-
doned, to the wrath of the Country Party, who owe the PREMIER
another grudge. MR. J. LowTHER observed that the money needed
to carry out the measure, would easily be raised if the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER would only levy a sovereign or two every time the
same arguments upon it were repeated in the House. Smart; but
until you have re-stated an argument about twelve times, the average
John BULL scarcely recognises the fact that you are arguing at all.
Ask the new Serjeants SLEIGH and SARGood how many times they
find it necessary to hammer an idea into what jurors consider their
brains. MR. MILL said that if there were a new attempt at legislation
on the subject, it ought to apply only to cattle from suspected countries,
and then there would soon be no suspected countries. . This is one of
the happy epigrams in which a true thinker wraps º wisdom. By the
way, MR. BRIGHT having expressed a sort of hope that MR. MILL was
seeing his way to the ballot,
that he hates it as much as ever. - - -
The Commons added a clause in the Railway Regulation Bill,
enacting that every train should have a smoking carriage. . .
But better late than never. Even the common enemy of mankind, the
South-Western, provides smoking §§§. which proves that
even in those of whom the world justifiably thinks the hardest, there is
some spark of goodness unextinguished. -
The #. Government Supplemental Bill was passed with the Lords'
amendments. This Act compels the use of MR. MoUIE’s invaluable
º invention in a large variety of cases, and is therefore a real
On.
Monday. LoRD NAPIER of Magdala and of Caryngton, in the County |
Palatinate of Chester, took his seat in the House of Lords. He was
isºl by LoRD LONGFord (Minister) and Lord STRATHNAIRN,
(Soldier).
The Bribery Bill was read a Second Time. Of course it did not
entirely satisfy LoRD RUSSELL, though he approved the principle, and
of course he improved the occasion to observe that Government had
been carried on for two years without the confidence of the House of
Commons. This says a good deal for the cleverness of the Govern-
ment and the cowardice of the Commons. The latter are dead, but
de mortuis nil nisi rerum.
Kindly reference was made to the memory of good and gentle LoRD
CRAN worTH, who, at a venerable age, expired peacefully on the pre-
vious Sunday. -
In the Commons MR. Roebuck asked whether a monument to
LoRD BROUGHAM ought not to be erected in the Abbey, MR, DISRAELI
and MR. GLADSTONE expressed themselves reverentially and affection-
ately on the subject, which is to be considered, and so, we are glad to
say, is the erection of a national monument to MICHAEL FARADAY.
He needs it not, but England needs it.
Everybody then went away, in order that SIRSTAFFORD Northcote
might introduce the Indian Budget. He presented it to a select
audience of 16, which at times rose to 18. As the subject affects
200,000,000 of our fellow-subjects, they will doubtless feel flattered at
the intense interest which India excites. The budget showed a deficit,
as there was last year, and as there will be next year, but Indian
affairs are held to be going on tolerably well. We are spending less
on useful public works, and more on the army and in expenditure in
England, which are two other gratifying facts. -
Then we had another theological debate. MR. WHALLEY described
Catholic priests as men who preached a º that was essentially
iº, and on remonstrance he withdrew the words, quietly adding
that he retained the opinion which they conveyed. The eternal bother
about the admission of priests to teach pauper children was renewed,
and dreadful twaddle was talked on both sides. Thank the Parcae, we
shall have no more of this rubbish for a while.
Tuesday. Hooray! The Electric Telegraphs, Bill passed the Lords.
Thanks to a pertinacious opposition, we shall pay the Companies a
great deal more than they ought to have, but we shall get decent tele-
grams, which will be promptly delivered as a rule and not as an excep-
tion. Thank you, Scuda MORE, we are sure.
A pleasant affair was mentioned in the Commons. By the “zealous
activity” (as was declared by a Minister) of MR. HEP worth Dixon,
five volumes of "...i State Papers, of the time of JAMES THE
FIRST, have been restored to England by the Library Committee of
philadelphia. The act was done in the gracious manner in which the
Americans always do a deed of kindness, and Punch was glad to hear
that our Government had forwarded to the Philadelphian Committee
in acknowledgment of its courtesy, 156 volumes of Chronicles an
Records of Great Britain and Ireland, with facsimiles of Domesda
Book, and some manuscripts, . He is pleased, too, that the Philadel-
phians have been pleased at this.
They play tricks with poor MR. REARDEN. We have heard some-
thing of this before, and about an Amendment he was nearly made to
move on the Irish Reform Bill. To-night he was instigated to move
R. MILL has published a letter declaring .
At last.
something about the mountebank TRAIN, but of course got no seconder,
and was knocked down at a single bidding by the SPEAKER.
Why should we not record that to-day
PATTI was married? It is not a Parliamentary fact. Well, we don’t
know and we don't care. Yes, the pet of the public was raised to the
Peerage by the title of MARQUISE DE CAux. If that is not exactly a
Parliamentary fact, it is quite near enough to one to give us an oppor-
tunity of wishing the Marquise all happiness, which we hereby do.
Thursday. The Lords sat for a few minutes to hear from LoRD
CAIRNs that he was not going to tell them anything definite about the
Courts of Justice, except that a plan had been agreed upon and would be
sent to the Treasury in a few days. Apropos of a great deal, a bit of the
Thames Embankment, from Westminster to Essex Street, was in-
augurated by SIR THwa ITEs and a lot of people who simply ran after
him, and cheered when he declared that the place, was open. It is
something on account, but it will be a long time before the work is
done. Punch pledges himself to prod everybody.
The Commons did not meet. i. us hope that they passed the day
|. fasting, penance, and resolves to be much better patriots for the
|
future—but we don’t believe they did.
Friday. Both Houses met to part. The Royal Assent was given to
half-a-ton of excellent Law. -
The Commons had a short final sitting. Among the items of interest
was a Resolution of the United States' Congress, thanking the House
for its message of sympathy, on the assassination of PRESIDENT
LINGOLN, and the attempted assassination of MR. SEWARD. . The com-
munication would seem to have come in some rather roundabout way
as those events took place in April 1865.
. The War Secretary announced that, the dreadful doom of annihila-
tion had gone forth against the Second Company of the First Adminis-
trative Battalion of the Hertfordshire Volunteers, for its insubordination
at the Windsor Review. We think that mercy should ever temper
|}. and that Government aid should be given to the wretched men
to enable them to emigrate, under assumed names, say to Western
Australia, whence, after perhaps half a century of penitence, they may
return, and lay their ancient bones beneath Hertfordshire sod.
The last occupation of the PALMERSTON House of Commons was to
behold poor MR. REARDEN, perform his final feat by moving for leave
to bring in a bill for Repeal of the Union. No one seconded him—no
one even bonneted him. The farce was too dismal. We were then
called to the Lords.
LoRD CHANCELLOR CAIRNs read MR. DISRAELI's Speech from the
Throne. It was brief, and well written:—
. Release, with thanks for diligence.
Friendliness with Foreign Powers.
. Brilliant Abyssinian success.
. Ireland quiet—no Fenian prisoners.
. Thanks for Supplies.
. Reform Scheme complete. - - -
. Various other laws—Schools—Railways—Fisheries—Telegraphs—
Scotch Legal Proceedings.
. Controller-in-Chief in War-Office. .. -
. Intention to dissolve “at the earliest day that will enable my
people to reap the benefit of the extended system of repre-
sentation.” - -
10. º confidence in their proving themselves worthy of the high
rl Willege.
11. Trust i under the blessing of Divine Providence the expression
of their opinion on those great questions of | policy which
have occupied the attention of Parliament, and remain undecided,
may lead to maintain unimpaired that civil and religious freedom
which has been secured to all my subjects by the institutions
and settlement of my realm.
Prorogation till Thursday, October the 8-h.
The last clause of course means MR. DisrAELI’s hope that the new
Parliament will maintain the Irish Church, Not, of course, that he
hopes or cares personally about that particular thing, but that particu-
lar thing means office or resignation. It may be however, that the
result may be brought about as a different issue. Never mind about
that. Sufficient for the day is the Order thereof.

THE WORST MANAGED RAILWAY RUNNING OUT OF LONDON.
º; ... Mong the London Lines *
º Eastern Counties, used to
bear away the bell for mis-
management. Its stations
were generally voted, the
most inconvenient and ill-
managed, its trains the slow-
est and most irregular, its
treatment of the public the
most unbearable, its results
to its shareholders the most
disastrous, its break-downs,
in whatever, it attempted,
the most entire and conspi-
cuous, in the world of Metro-
politan Railways. -
The Eastern Counties

the proud distinction of
being absolutely the worst-
* º # London.
t must yield the -Ill.
this respect to the §.
Western.
ſlº Vºž The conductors of that
ſ ºf line may boast that they
| ||||I. º have brought bad manage-
== ment more completely to a
system than the directors
of the Great Eastern ever
succeeded in doing. Their
# stations are dirtier, their
arrangements for ticket-
taking more inconvenient
and insufficient, their staff
of porters more scanty, their
train and station attendants
- - - - - more uncourteous and in-
attentive, their carriages filthier and more insufficient, their times worse kept, than
ever were those of the Eastern Counties in their grandest phase of mismanagement.
When this is the case with the ordinary traffic of the South-Western line, it may
be supposed that matters do not improve under the pressure of an extraordina
occasion, like a Volunteer Review, a monster excursion, or any other demand whic
tests official mettle.
ſº ſtis hardly necessary to say that the normal condition of the South-Western on
these occasions is utter collapse and blank break-down, borne on the part of the
Company's servants with the calmnessengendered by long experience of calamity
and on the part of the public, with vociferous wrath among the inexperienced, and
with that concentrated, but silent, indignation among those who know the Company
and its ways, which finds its best comfort in looking forward to a clean sweep some
day of incompetent managers, directors, and chairmen, all together.
n all suffer, Mr. Punch ventures to complain, and hereby pronounees, and
means to go on pronouncing, till he sees a change for the better, THE South-
WESTERN THE WoRST MANAGED RAILway THAT RUNs out of Los Don.
The South-Western, claims credit on two grounds. It has avoided accidents
and it has not cooked accounts. Quite true. But what if it have purchased
safety by slowness, and maintained its dividends by starving its service It
has carried, nine-hundred and ninety-nine thousand passengers at a snail’s pace,
that it might boast the millionth's immunity, from #. and it has put one-
fifteenth per cent. into the º of twenty thousand shareholders, by destroying
the comfort and crippling the accommodation of as many million passengers.
And this is Railway Economy a la Mangles /
THE CABMEN'S FLOWER SHOW.
People complain sadly that Cabmen are uncivil, and even go so far as to say
they are uncivilised. There certainly, however, are exceptions to this rule. Mr.
Punch the other evening was ºil, hanked for giving to a cabman his proper
legalfare. More than this, there is a Cabmen's Flower-show on view now at the
Euston Terminus. Only think of Cabmen being worshippers of Flora, and sºlºing
for their place of worship the precincts of the other ancient deity called Terminusi
All a joke, eh? Not a bit of it. The show has cost the cabbies a matter of five
pounds, and that surely is no joke to men who work so hard, and whose incomes
are so limited. Mr. Punch has seen enough of ordinary flower-shows to wish to see
no more of them; but this at Euston Square is really so extraordinary, that he
hopes to see another and another still succeeding the success which has attended it.
Perhaps at the next Flower-show the Cabmen may inaugurate, a first prize will be
:- º: the pink of politeness, which some of them assuredly might be advised to
lvate.

POEM BY LORD WINCHELSEA.
YEARs ago you published a poem, not exactly in
my honour, beginning
“Silly little Finches have silly little ears.”
That, Sir, I have forgiven you, I write much better poetry
now, I assure you, than that which called forth your criti-
cism. In proof Ibeg to enclose you a composition which
I have just completed, and it will much please me, and the
rest ºf the aristocracy, if you will give it publicity.
Ishall also be delighted if you will admit any critical re-
marks which this poem may callout from delighted readers.
Believe me, Yours very sincerely,
August 4. WINCHELSEA.

As it fell upon a #.
Sliding down the Milky Way,
Like a little child of Zion

As she sang Ising to you :
Neither more and neither less,

When the silver stars are steaming,
Earthis on its axis dreaming,
When the comet-bolt is shot,
I am there and I am not.
Watch me when Orion sickens

Watch me when Osiris perches
On the wrecks of Irish Churches,
Watch me when the Red Star, Ares,
Cries aloud “Reform your Dairies.”
When each gipsy Dimber-Damber
Wraps him in a sheet of amber, .

When electric organs roar

And the mermaid seeks her den,
Eating oysters—watch me then.

When young SARA left her alley,

tain }}. ” as a piece which may not, perhaps, be far from the mark.
The polka (the music suggested turns out to be a polka) is produced,
and is inspected by BILscox BE, who says he doesn't think it is it, but
as he cannot iii. notes very well, (that is his apology for knowing
nothing at all about it) he asks the foreman to play it. The foreman
cannot do that, but MR. J.ENKINs, their tuner, has just gone |.
and he would oblige, the foreman is sure, MR. J.ENKINs, a thin man
in spectacles, comes down and obliges, and the tune is as much like
what BILscom BE has been humming as “God Save the Queen’’ is to the
“College Hornpipe.” BILscom BE is profuse in his thanks, and wishes
MR. TUNER to oblige again. Three pieces are tried; nothing like it
any of 'em; and Briscom BE says to me aside, “We ought to buy one,
it looks so odd; ” but as he makes no further advance in the matter,
I purchase it, to save appearances. . He praises me outside for this
conduct, but doesn’t offer to buy it himself, though I show him that it
is of no use to me, and I can't get it into any pocket. He says that by
going a little out of the way we shall pass a post-office, where I can go
In i. it to some lady of my acquaintance, and send it with my
compliments; then, he adds, we will at once go to the park. I agree,
this being really a good idea. Unfortunately we have to pass (on our
return from the Post-office he sees it, though he didn't as we were going)
the shop of the well-known Music Publishers, MEssRs. Toot LE AND
SoNs.
He will look in : on condition that this shall be the last, I accompany
him. The shop is a business-like p and an eminent composer is
being bowed out by MR. Tootle himself.
Every one else being occupied, MR. Tootie undertakes to attend to
him. BILscombe adopts a new plan here. He explains about his good
ear, and is increasing the length and interest of the story since I last
heard it, when MR. Tootle, º under the impression that some-
thing is going to be proposed for the good of the art in general, and
his firm in particular, asks B11sco MBE and myself into his private room.
When there, he apologises for the absence of the Sons, who generally
manage these matters; but will we be seated, and lºſſ from one to
the other as if we were another firm with an idea for him) will we
explain. I reply that it's BILsco MBE who—and BILscom BE begins in
some confusion.
MR. Tootle leans back in his chair, joins his hands in front, and
listens attentively. Bliscom BE (politely, of course) intimates his belief
in MR. Tootle personally as a musician (Tootie bows) and therefore
what he is going to put to him, MR. ToQTLE knowing what it is to
have an Éar, bow again towards his hands) will not a pearso strange.
“To put it shortly,” says BILscoy Be, evidently feeling that he is
inclined to wander, “perhaps MR. Tootle knows, or has heard, he
may as well explain it is for business purposes—theatrical purposes—”
(bow from Tootle as before)—“perhaps MR. Tootle knows an air
which begins—” here he leans forward and directs. Tootle with his
finger as a baton, “Rum ti dum tum tiddy–run ti dum—and that’s
where he loses it.’
Tootle looks at us. on the next step.
He is evidently $ºf ul
If the Sons were at home we should º be kicked out. As it is,
MR. Tootle, with his eye fixed on BILsco MBE, rises and opens the
door, so as to command help (if necessary) from the shop. I rise and
say, “I’m afraid we’re * # mix myself up in it now) “taking up his
valuable time.” MR. Tootle doesn't deny it, and I go into the shop
as quickly as possible. -
BILscom BE is stopping to say that should MR. Tootle think of the
tune—he is certain it begins Rumtiti or Rum tum or dum—when MR.
TootLE answers abruptly, “’Yes, certainly,” and closes the door.

HERALDRY IN GUILDHALL.
The Chamberlain of the City of London is supposed to be as it were
the Brain of the Civic Body—the Intelligence of the Corporation.
Personally MR. B. Scott is reputed to be a gentleman of erudition—in
particular, a good antiquarian. As such he may be credited with a
robable knowledge of a science so nearly akin to archaeology as
heraldry is. Of course, therefore, it is to be presumed that he knew
what he was talking about when in delivering his address on the pre-

licence has been granted to the soldier as the reward of valour, and severity
has sometimes been permitted to degenerate into cruelty; thus the escutcheon
of many a successful leader is disfigured with the bar sinister.”
The commonly entertained supposition is, that there is only one way
in which an escutcheon can be disfigured | a sinister. This must
be wrong if MR. Scott, in his above-quoted statement on that subject,
is right. Perhaps he will take some opportunity of informing the
public by how many, acts of a man's own the disfigurement of a bar
sinister can be entailed on his escutcheon.

“As green as grass” is a trite simile, and usually a true one... But

-- PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MRS. PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HER DAUGHTER.
INCERELY, MY DEAR
CHILD,-it is the
source of the great-
est gratification to
me that you receive
these lucubrations
of your Mamma in
a meek and appre-
ciative spirit; for
nothing would have
more completely
harrowed up my
feelings and those of
your anxious Papa,
than the discovery
that in spite of all
* our training—in
spite of the educa-
tional conclave we
summoned on your
behalf, consisting of
MR. Ruskin, MR.
MUDIE, and all his
novelists, male and
female, LoRD
SHAFTESBURY, the
Author of “The
Girl of the Period,”
and other social and
educational authorities, you were a mere “Girl of the Period,” after
all, with no sort of respect for your mother and her old-fashioned,
homely notions. -
You ask me, and I respect you for putting the question,-"What
books of instruction do yºu advise me to read before setting out on
this foreign trip, Mamma; *-but, I am sorry to tell you, my daughter,
that reading for instruction would be sadly out of place upon such an
occasion, and that if you wish to compete with the other young ladies
abroad for social and matrimonial successes, you must store your mind
with the utmost possible number of fictions, such as, “ Unwisely, but not
too well,” “Cometh up as a Nettle,” &c. Thus prepared you can travel
all over Europe with advantage, no, matter through what scenes of
historic or artistic interest you pass through. As much history as you
t in “Byron,” will not, perhaps, do you any harm, but do not venture
yond that.
usic is an important element in English life abroad. I have seen
the occupants of a salon in a fashionable hotel entirely taken by storm,
awed, thunderstruck, enslaved for ever, by an audacious maiden of
seventeen who without any ceremony, or invitation, sat down at the
piano and played noisy operatic airs for upwards of an hour. It was
so coolly and charmingly done that she carried everything before her
ever after, and married the gentleman she had startled the utmost.
If you wish, therefore, to do as others do, you must get up your
music, and create a sensation with it whenever opportunity offers. But
what is music in comparison to dress P
Ah! how well I remember the last time I went to Switzerland with
dear Mr. Punch (who had worn himself to a skeleton in the effort to
educate his party during one or two trying parliamentary seasons) with
what admiration we noticed the modest demeanour and sweet º:
dress of the young Swiss ladies at Neufchâtel, Geneva, and other
towns. We looked from one of these to one of our young country-
women, and Mr. Punch said, “Look, on this picture and on that,”
and sighed, and could hardly eat any dinner.
If I consulted my own wishes, I should take you abroad in the
costume we both admired so much, but I think of the future, and
hesitate. May not your whole prospects in life be at stake, and have
I the right to sacrifice my child's interests for any motive whatever ?
No, I arm myself with the thought that I am doing my duty, and march
off to Regent Street to buy porkpie hats, flimsy dresses stuck all over
with ribbons, two chignons, one brown and one golden, with lºng
curls to match, pinched up little boots trimmed with tassels, miles
length of coloured ribbon to make streamers of, little bonnets, little
ſº little parasols, everything little that ought to be big, and every:
thing big that ought to be little. Then I say to my daughter-go and
Conquer.
But a dashing toilet does not suffice alone. A dashing manner must
accompany it, or all the arts and crafts of milliner and dressmaker will
end in defeat. Have no fear of anything or anybody. , Set at defiance
the ordinary rules of etiquette. Flirt in season, and out of season.
Talk, to any amount on any topic. Improve upon the models with
which modern fiction supplies you, and wait the issue with hope and
umph.
§§ my JUDIANA, is the advice that I give you before setting out
WOL. Lv.
on your travels, not wise advice perhaps, but the only advice possible
under the circumstances. We shall not see much of the countries we
visit; we shall be subject to many mortifications; we shall perhaps sit
down to table with MR. Soles, the shoemaker, and his family, or MR.
and MRs. MARRow, our worthy butcher's wife: we may find after aii
that LoRD and LADY CHURCH MoUse are only gracious when it is
raining hard and nobody else is in the way, and begin to snub us
directly the sun shines; or the trip may end in no grand acquaintances
at all; but we shall have gone to a certain number of places and to a
certain number of fashionable hotels: we shall have done as other
people do; and if that is not a crowning satisfaction, what is?
I must tell you that your Papa is very vexed about the Boy in Buttons,
and will not hear of it for a moment. “I did not expect, it of you,
Mrs. Punch : I did not indeed,” he said, and summoning the boy, who is
a very nice little boy and was quite delighted at the idea of seeing
foreign, parts, SAMUEL,” says Mr. Punch very, sternly, “I believe
your calling is Penny Papers?” “Yes, Sir,” said the boy, very down-

to the topic.
How do other people manage, I wonder? If we cannot afford a
Buttons for six weeks, how can MRs. So-AND-So, over the way, afford
a footman all the year round? I don't envy people their flunkeys, but
I envy their management. If good management does it all, are not
we to blame who manage badly, and go without the elegancies of
life P Mr. Punch knows what our friends' incomes are, and says they
make a rule of not paying their bills. But why should we be compelle
to |...} if tradesmen let others off?
et that be as it may, we must yield the Boy in Buttons, and cut as
good a figure as we can with maid and courier.
The courage is a little taken out of me by this act of Mr. Punch's.
I would just as soon go to Bournemouth or Brighton, since we cannot
make a grand appearance abroad; but the tourist tickets are taken,
our plans are noised among our friends, and if we gave them up at the
eleventh hour, they would think that there was something in it, which
would never do. Let your actions appear accountable to fools, and
their tongues will not wag about you.
We, therefore, obey Mr. Punch's mandate with the best grace we are
able, and go abroad, to see as much of English society, and rattle over
as many miles of railroad as possible, in the holiday allotted to us. Upon
our adventures I will duly moralise to you in another letter,
Your excited Mother,
MRs. PUNCH.
P.S.. I have just heard that the Dowager LADY CRAB, with her
maid, man, and their dogs will cross over in the mail-packet with us
to-morrow. Put your gold-stoppered scent-bottle in your pocket, and
if my lady is ill and my lady's maid incapable of waiting upon her, offer
your bottle with your sweetest smile, and feed the dogs with biscuit. It
will be a fine opportunity of commencing an acquaintance.
P.S. No. 2. English is the language of the countries through which
we pass. I name this as you nairely suggested taking “Murray's
Tracellers' Talk” in your pocket—unsophisticated JUDIANA
NARCISSUS PER DEWLA LUSTRA VAGANS.
MR. NARCIssus (as he called himself) REED does not resign the
Constructorship of the Navy, and go into the House to defend his
mistakes. It is not that the reed has been shaken by the wind, but
that the Admiralty has. They know that he is wrong, and that Cowper
CoLEs is right about the turrets, but sooner than have a disturbance
with NARcissus, they let him conquer them and the British Navy. He
has piped and they have danced, and soon they will
“Tell us how with eager speed
They flew to hear their vocal REED,
And how with Bumbledom profound,
They came to judgment quite unsound.”
On the whole we are sorry, partly for the sake of the Navy, though
| “that’s but a trifle here,” chiefly because we should like to see
| NARcissus in Parliament. Now, his classic hard-heartedness returned,
he scorns the Echo of St. Stephens, and is as much in love with himself
as ever. Wale, inquit et Echo.

ARCHBishop MANNING announces (a Pall Mall Gazette reminds us)
that the Pope is for the separation of Church and State. Therefore
of course, DR. MANNING is for it. But the Pope, in an edict of no old
date, announced that, to advocate such separation, was a something-
able Error. Ergo, either the Pope or the ARCHBishor, or both, must
be Heretical. Now, as Rome is entirely under Church rule, there is

“BRAVO, SIR JOHN 1"
That brave and noble old soldier, the Constable of the Tower, has
just published a letter upon certain incidents of the Crimean War. SIR
olin Fox BURGoyNE's name, at the end of an epistle, would ordinarily
save Mr. Punch the necessity of calling attention to anything the
Constable might have to say, but newspapers are not regularly or
carefully read in the holidays, and Punch is. Therefore, a few lines.
Firstly, at Sebastopol, the Russians were tremendously strong, much
stronger than the besiegers. -
Secondly, LoRD RAGLAN did not wish to attack the north side, for
the double reason that if won, it would not have given him the south
side, where all the Russian resources were, and that it would have left
him dangerously exposed, without even a sea-basis.
Thirdly, LoRD RAGLAN did not §. to GENERAL CANRoBERT an
attack in front immediately on §. ing of the Allies, because such a
course would have violated common sense, and would, as SIR John
says, have been an act of madness, which would have caused us to be
beaten off with heavy loss. GENERAL CANROBERT, on the 18th of last
July, confirms this statement, and adds l'expression de son affectueur
découement, evidently more than phrase of compliment.
Fourthly, Sebastopol could not, with its resources, have been taken
at that time, and SIR John, almost touchingly, says, “I should have
been #: have defended it with 20,000 men.” Wouldn't he have
defended it? The Russians had more than 25,000.
Fifthly, The verdict of ºil be more favourable to the Army
than its contemporaries have been. “The English people have no
reason to be ashamed of the part played by their countrymen in the
Crimea.” We should think not. -
Lastly, “OUR MEANs were totALLY INADEQUATE To our TAsk.”
That is for the War Authorities, who are now . the Volunteers,
and will, if not hindered, destroy that Household Guard. And so,
with the heartiest thanks to the brave old Constable for standing out
to stand }. for the Army, Punch wishes him many a happy year of
repose under his laurels.
SERMONS AND SUFFERERS.
PEOPLE, who complain of the length and dulness of Sermons should
consider that listening to the discourse of an average Clergyman is an
exercise of the Christian virtue of patience. Perhaps it may be said,
indeed, to be something more. It may be regarded as a sort of
Protestant penance. This view is confirmed by the fact that the
Ritualists, as a rule, preach short sermons. They very likely think it
quite enough to enjoin their penitents to get themselves flogged, to
crawl a long way on their hands and knees, or walk about with peas
(unboiled) in their balmorals. Therefore we may suppose that, when
Ritualists preach, they considerately endeavour to inflict as little as
possible of their tediousness upon their hearers.
A Testimonial.
THE other day a worthy gentleman was presented with a Clock as a
Testimonial. Now what would the present of a clock signify? Cer.
tainly not that he was “up to the time of day,” or the gift would be
superfluous. Had he been the secretary of a Company on the verge of
dissolution, it would have constantly reminded him of the minutes of
proceedings and the Winding-up Act. Qr was the testimonial satirical,
covertly hinting that the donee was a Time-server? If none of these,

THE GREAT ECLIPSE.
THE Great Eclipse is fixed for Tuesday, August the 18th. Tuesday
next as ever is. We do not want to frighten anybody, of course
we think everybody had better be prepared. Because such an Éclipse
is a very tremendous phenomenon, and the Sun will be darkened for at
least six minutes, and longer if anything goes wrong. The newspapers,
under the instructions of üovernment, have been spreading the belief
that the Eclipse will not affect this country. The object of the authori-
ties is benevolent, but it is questionable whether the propagation of a
fable is justifiable under any circumstances. It is better to know the
truth. The phenomenon will not affect Switzerland, and HER MAJESTY's
journey thither is well understood. The venerable ARCHBishop of
QANTERBURY has also departed for a distant part of the Continent, and
he is to be followed by the Bishop of LoNDoN. The PRINCE and
PRINCEss of WALEs will not be in London on the 18th, that is also
certain, unless the Heir-Apparent, with the proverbial courage of the
Royal Family, shall deem it his duty to be present to re-assure the
Metropolis. But we say again, let no person be more frightened than
is becoming in the presence of such an apparition, over which it is
impossible to exercise any control, . We do not say that there is any
real danger, but danger is invariably greatest when unsuspected. Let
proper precautions be taken. We have had no total Eclipse of the
Sun since 1715, and of course the present generation is without expe-
rience as to the necessary provisions. First, let every housekeeper
remove all knockers, bells, rails, balconies, in fact all metal likely to be
acted on by the penumbra of the node, and let these be placed, if pos-
sible, in a cellar, but if not, in a darkened apartment, from the walls of
which the paper, if stained with any metallic agent, must carefully be
torn down. windows, and most especially skylights, must be
painted over with any dark colour, or if this be not easily attainable,
cover them with paste by means of a brush, and throw on soot or black
ash, until light is effectually excluded. Have an earthenware flower.
Pot in every room, and let this be half filled with sulphur, ready for
Ignition the moment that the apogee manifests itself. So much danger
arises, from the use of fire-arms that we hesitate to recommend them;
but where children and servants can be trusted, the continual discharge
but
of guns and pistols (of course without ball) is a great safeguard, and in
any house with a gong, let it be beaten from morning to night, the
servants relieving one another—in humbler homes large bones beaten
on the shovels in the house, will be available. The danger from the
mesozoic eocene may be much diminished by continuous inhalations of
nitrate of hydrogen, and where practicable this should be taken in bed,
which should be carefully turned due east and west, except in extra-
Fºliº districts, where the mattrasses, &c. must be thrown to the
oor. All food must be avoided sedulously, and the only really safe
drink during the phenomena will be barley-water in which chloride of
ammonium or gentian has been infused. , Silence should be preserved
as far as possible, especially º females, children, and persons with high
| WOlces.
arking of dogs and talking of parrots must be prevented at
all hazards—it is better to destroy a dog or a bird than to risk oolitic
aberration. These few hints as to what is absolutely necessary we
reprint, with permission, from the Nautical Almanack for Marines, and
though such details are not akin to the usual contents of our.columns,
the solemn and exceptional nature of the great phenomenon will be
our excuse. We repeat that we hope all will pass off well, and this is
all that we dare say.
Godfather to a Great Gun.
THE Pall Mall Gazette says:—
“We have been informed that the Peabody gun has been adopted as a new
arm by the Swiss Government.”
The Peabody gun perhaps derives its name from its . for
throwing shells, and thus, in a manner shelling out. Considering what
shot it may be supposed to carry, we may estimate it to be at least a
hundred thousand pounder.
THOUGHT BY AN OPTIMIST.
THE good people there are in the world are wholly unknown to many
of us. Do you doubt it? Then think of the perfect Strangers you
have met with in your life.

ODD MEN OUT.
MAN WITH AN EAR.—SECOND SPECIES OF THE GENUS.
Before quitting the Man with an Ear I must come to the second
species of this genus. He is the Man with an Ear who plays by it, on
some instrument. One instance in point will suffice, and we will then
#. on to the other lusus natura enumerated in my first number.
ere is my experience.
When I am unwell, and in need of rest, I write to a distant relative
I mean a near relative who lives a hundred miles away from town, and
suggest my staying with him. Distant relative being an invalid of
some standing himself, is generally glad of the º of recount-
ing to some one besides (i. doctor, the curate, and his housekeeper,
his symptoms since we last met; say, perhaps, six or seven months ago.
At his house I may depend upon absolute quiet. Here among cawing
rooks and glistening trout [of course I don’t live among the trout or
the rooks, j this poetical description must be accepted in the true
sense] i. may recover that internal peace of mind and health of body
which London organs, villanous German bands, the rattling of cabs an
omnibuses, the jolting of underground, railways, and the business of
metropolitan pleasure, have previously done so much to destroy.
“At Drouzemoor-Ripple I shall be happy,” I said to myself on a
recent occasion ; “and to be all alone, º the exception of my excel-
lent relative, will do me a world of good.”
This was soon after the HANDEL Festival, when, being of a fine
organisation and a peculiarly nervous temperament, the four thousand
voices had somehow or another suddenly galvanised me into a sort
of hysterica passio, and I was suffering from HAN DEL and hysteria.
In this state I proposed, and was accepted, for a spare bed at calm,
sleepy, pleasant, soothing Drouzemoor-Ripple. On arriving, my relative
met me at the door, and we at once compared notes of how we’d
been for the last few months.
He generally has the advantage of me in reminiscences, but I can
beat him in present afflictions. A good deal, too, depends upon who
gets the first opportunity of describing his symptoms. If he begins
and exhausts every part of his º, having had a pain everywhere, it
is evident that I can’t go beyond that. But if he leaves out a leg, or
arm, or a hand, or a finger, then I seize the vacant place immediately,
and there I plant my º -
For every ache of his, I have three : for every three, six, and so
forth. Has he suffered from headaches which have kept him awake
for two nights at a time, why I’ve had 'em for weeks together. Has
he been knocked over by bronchitis—I have been brought nigh to
death's door by diphtheria. Has he had scarlet fever—I adopt a kind
of tertian ague. As for colds, coughs, toothaches, and ear-aches, we
throw those in as a matter of course, and they don’t count for much
now. I have lately shown premonitory symptoms of gout. This was a
strong point with me at our meeting. He had never thought of the gout.
In fact, whatever he has not had, I have, and so we get on very
pleasantly together.
A surgical operation which I was fortunate enough to have under-
gone years ago, is always my last resort, and wins the field. I am
afraid, however, that the next time we meet he will have undergone
one too, merely out of envy. However, whatever his envy be I'll back
my old operation against it. I will not dwell upºn these pleasing topics
any longer, but it was necessary to show you “how,” as the advertise-
ments say, “to pass a happy day” at Druzemoor. Ripple. This time
there was no necessity to fall back upon the operation, as Incipient
Gout carried all before it triumphantly. My relative was rather prou
of my having the Gout, and volunteered instances in point about my
Grandfather and Great Grandfather.
Second day of my Pisit.—My invalid relative is not down to break-
fast, being, the butler informs me, too unwell to leave his room this
morning. I sit alone, happily, with my Times, my Pall Mall Gazette,
and Post. Strangely enough I see mºre of the newspapers, here, a
hundred miles from town than I do in London. What more delicious
than to cut a slice of grilled chicken, accompanying it with a morsel of
buttered toast, and then, while engaged upon §. combination, to read
some twenty lines of interesting news P. What more delicious, I say
than this, for a nervous invalid You take in telegrams with your tea,
leisurely, and murmur to yourself your opinions on the Government
policy without fear of contradiction. And this is a great thing, because
with an hysterical subject, contradiction invariably flies to the head.
Then I lounge over the grass: I watch the trout and the carp, and
the jack, and I wonder which are the carp and which the jack, and
whether what I took for a trout is a trout, or a floating weed. It gene-
rally is a weed: except when I have taken it for a weed, when it turns
out to be a trout.
I look at the view, I sigh with pleasure as the gentle breeze passes
among the branches, º, a polite , request, that the leaves
will be good enough to move a little, and let it go by. So the leaves
move a little, lazily, and the wind travels onward, and my relative in
his nightcap (being old-fashioned) and dressing-gown, appears at a
first-floor, window, unopened, and nods, smilingly, holding up a letter
to which he evidently wishes to draw my attention. 2x
Satisfied that he is not walking in his sleep, I say, “What's that?
Not that I care, not that, I’ve the slightest curiosity. Qn the con;
trary, I would rather not be troubled with letters now, and the servant
in town has particular orders not to forward anything to me, for a week,
But I ask, “What's that?” because it is evident to the laziest
capacity that that is what my "...º. relative wishes me to say. He
opens a little pane in his window, drops the letter out, and closes, it

action, arises in my mind that this were Spain, and behind that window
a dark Señorita dropping a billet dour at my feet, instead of a hypo-
chondriac relation in a night-cap and faded dressing-gown. -
The letter is very brief, and very much to the point. It says simply
DEAR DAD, -
Returned suddenly. Shall be with you to dinner at 6:30, and
sleep. Your affectionate Son,
FRED.
Well, I am not sorry; one person can’t destroy the º of this
delicious spot, and, as I haven't seen my Cousin FRED for years (I
think when we last met I was small enough for him to kick me for
saying I'd seen him smoking), why it will be a new sensation. Besides
he can’t be very noisy, as i he proposes is, “to come to et all
sleep.” As I subsequently discover, this is precisely what he has
come to do, and this is his exact order of doing them. -
I nod to my relative cheerfully and say “capital.” He is so pleased
at the prospect of seeing his son who, I find out, only turns up when
in want of money, that he has pains all over him for the rest of the day
until it is time to dress for dinner, to which he comes down with a
mustard plaster concealed somewhere.
To the outer world, i.e. the butler, the footman, m
myself, my relative is in evening dress clothes—intern
this black mockery, he is blisters. - -
I go to dress, and when we meet at dinner my long-lost-cousin has
arrived. He is (I did not, know it when I cordially greeted him) the
other species of the genus Man with an Ear. -
He doesn’t talk much, but he hums a good deal to himself. He is very
lad to see me, so he says, but we are . rather shy of one another.
#. is not great at conversation, at least not at first. He is older than
I am by nearly ten years. He says, he thinks it’s a little colder. ..I
reply that I think it is—perhaps. He hums, and spreads his coat-tails
before the grate, though there’s no fire. He looks up at the chan-
delier and hums—he breaks off humming to wonder when the Gover-
nor will be dressed. Then he laughs at nothing—then he hums again.
I descant upon the Governor's health – on health in general. He
hums all the time in an undertone, so that I am as it is called on the
operatic stage “Speaking through music.”
He interrupts his humming to say ‘Yes or no,” as the case may be.
He tells me suddenly he’s glad I’m here, it’s so dull alone with the
Guy. I return the compliment, omitting all mention of dulness, as
in fact the Guv's style of disposing of himself suits me to a nicety.
That is we, when alone together, talk rheumatics during dinner, com-
plaining that we can't eat anything; and after dinner, we talk politics,
and finish a bottle of old Port, because we must be very careful as to
what we take.
Seren o'clock.-Guv comes down late, with an apology for his mustard
laster. Dinner announced. My long-lost Cousin FRED takes me
y the arm and hums me across the hall into the dining-room. My
relative says grace devoutly, and I detect an undercurrent of humming

he kept DAMON. But MR. JEFFERson DAvis, who is to be tried for
High Treason late in the Greek Kalends, is comfortably settled at
Liverpool, leaving nobody as hostage, except HQRACE GREELY and a

it catches me behind, i. in the nape of the neck, which they tell me
is just where a cove fust feels a sunstroke. So in coarse you see I

feller, it’s the drink. And then he spouts me this here sermon from a
%. }: were reading, which he said it were the British Medical
ozzzzzzz! :-
“As the heat begets thirst it is well to remember that alcoholic liquors and
high feeding are the great aids of the burning sun in producing sunstroke.
SIR. RANAL.D. MARTIN relates, from his Indian experience, some striking
examples of the effetts of enforced abstinence among troops in warding off the
fatality from sunstroke on a burning march, and others, equally well marked
of the opposite effects of indulgence. Light wines, plentifully diluted, an
aérated waters are the suitable drinks for this temperature; sulphuric acid
lemonade is at once refreshing and an excellent prophylactic of diarrhoea.”
MR. PUNCH, S
Well, I º I’m a true Briton and I must 'ave my beer, which I
takes my 'ar pint ler at each end of my journeys. If You calls that
“indulgence,” you’d better take the reins and drive the 'bus yourself,
which, mind you, it’s ’ard work, especially this weather, and a man to
do... his work had need put something into him.... Light wines may
suit them forriners, which they’re as used to broiling in the summer
as the eels gets used to skinning. But to my belief an Englishman
can’t live without his beer, and as for squenching of his thirst with
sulphuric acid stuff, he would as soon take a black dose, or a drain
of arsafetida'ſ "Soli remain, Sir, yours most humble to command,

P.S. The Medical Journal says likeways that “a good large silk
umbrella will save any one from sunstroke.” What would the public
say, I wonder, if we drivers was to strike, because our governors won’t
furnish us with large silk umberellers ?
MORE EFFECTS OF THE HOT WEATHER.
MR. SwellingtoN last Wednesday walked out without his gloves
on, a feat which was entirely owing to the hot weather.
Mr. Lateriºd has been so much overcome by the great heat that,
he has found it difficult to dine until just midnight.
MR, HobbLER, being chaffed for having suffered from the gout,
remarked that such attacks were all owing to the heat, as any gardener
would tell you that a hot summer produced abundance of toe-martyrs.
MR. HARDUPPE found his º so much impaired by the hot
weather that he quite forgot to pay his debts ere starting for the con-
tinent.
MR, TIPPLER finds the heat affect his º: terribly. , “The sun
is in his eyes” continually just now, and by an optical delusion he
frequently sees double. -- - -
GENERAL LovER has been jilted for the second time this summer, as
the lady could not bear the warmth of his affection.
CAPTAIN SHARPER, who in general is a notedly cool hand, with the
thermometer at 90°, has quite lost his reputation.
“We'll Sweep Yer 1"
We hear that the Railway Bullies are renewing the old threat that,
if people who can afford first and second class fare choose to ride third,
the companies will serve them out by inserting Chimney Sweeps into
the carriages. The threat should carry no terror. Physically, a penny
newspaper spread between oneself and the sweep would prevent an
real injury, unless Chummy were a ruffian, in which case a stout stic
would settle the question with his nob. Morally, Punch would much
rather ride in a carriage with an honest Sweep than with a railway
man who had lured poor folks into a suburb, and then suddenly raised
their fare 100 per cent. Ride third class, masculine enemies of swind-
ling, and never fear Sweep or Director.

OR THWEE
PATTI IN A NEW PLACE.
MY DEAR MR. Punch,
- YoU will, I am sure, feel a lively interest in the following
information which I extract from some foreign correspondence:—
“It is not in some quiet spot in England or Scotland, or at some pretty
Swiss chalet, or other delightful retreat from the bustle of the world, that
ADELINA PATTI, now the $º. of CAUx, is passing her honeymoon.
It is in Paris. The young Marchioness was present at the Opera on Monday
evening, in an open box in the dress circle, when the Trouvière and the §.
were represented. Notwithstanding the heat of the weather, the house was
crowded, and, as may be supposed, PATTI was the observed of all observers.”
* This is just the thing that aº artiste like the charming PATT1,
circumstanced as she was, would do. One can imagine what a luxury
for her there was in going from the back of the house to the front, and
in listening to a performance as º: as her own, if there is any.
It was very natural of her, for one f easure of her honeymoon, to go to
the Opera. But may I be allowed, dare I venture to say, that, grace
and elegance apart, in so doing our sweet PATTI reminds me very much
of one Bob, the waiter at a tavern near unto Drury Lane? #. aS
perhaps you are aware, when he had got a holiday, was accustomed to
spend it in sitting down to one of the tables at which on other days he
attended, and causing himself to be served by his fellow-waiters. In
suggesting this parallel am I guilty of a base comparison? Nay, say
not so., “One touch of Nature makes the whole world kin.” Adorable
PATTI has ministered to our enjoyment in a very high degree, but so
likewise has BoB in no small measure. In so saying, ". dear Sir,
I think I speak not for myself alone, but for you as well as for
MEMOR.
P.S., You have doubtless seen the agreeable announcement that
PATTI has not finally retired from the stage. If ever I have the plea-
Yours truly,
sure of . her as Alice in Roberto il Diavolo, her great scene with
Robert will always make her remind me of BoB.
A JOLLY CHRISTENING.
SEssion and Season are over, and Mr. Punch, gladly turning from
what good QUEEN Bess called the lippe-laboured orations out of the
i.e. mouthes of the House of Commons (she struck out “ §§.
ut we replace it) and all the other rubbish that has prevented his im-
roving his mind, proposes to devote himself to a perusal of the Six
undred and Sixty Thousand Volumes which his friend MR...WINTER
JoNEs has had counted in the British Museum. But before addressing
himself to his studies, he proposes, and moreover resolves, to drink one
large bumper (it may be more, but details are unimportant) to the
health of the youngest Christian of his royal house. A health to the
PRINCEss Victoria ALEXANDRA QLGA MARY, fourth child of Marl-
borough House...Perhaps he would not have made public note of this
ceremonial, but that the christening on the Sixth of August seems to
have been one of good old English jollity. After the ten godmothers
and godfathers had promised and vowed, there was a banquet, with
music from Fra Diavolo, and other merry works, and then the young
parents went to the play, that is, to the Holborn Amphitheatre, to see
the horses and the acrobats. Another bumper to the jovial Prince
and his adored wife. “England yet”—yes, and Merry England yet,
my Puritans and Ritualists.
Sporting.
A CoRREspondent sends us the following heading to an advertise-
ment which caught his eye the other day:—
ET OF FOX HUNTS, BY HERRING..—These four beautiful
Coloured Pictures, &c.
A Fox Hunt by HERRING must surely be the picture of a Drag.
WHEN is an author most likely to be sick of his own writing?
When he’s regularly in the swing.

MR. PUNCH,
MY tongue being bridled, and my canine privileges curtailed,
you will pardon me appealing to public justice through those respectable
agents-pen and ink.
It is high time, Mr. Punch, that our family had a recognised voice in
Parliament. At present our quasi representatives are most inefficient.
I know one who comes from my county, who is a good setter, but he
can't bark. Another can only snarl at an estimate, though perhaps he
may snap at a place; and a third is always getting in a §. way,
. coming out with a yelp. If we look into Boroughs what do we
find? No qualified champion of our persecuted race. The majority
pride themselves on their clever little tricks, and I confess it is rather
surprising how they stand up and beg; Now and then one of the pack
breaks forth with a lamentable howl, but which among them I would
ask does his duty dogfully when he sees a rat in the house Ay—
there’s the rub.
Taxation and representation, we are told, should go together. Well
don’t we pay our quota when the fiscal burdens which we bear extend
from poll to poll?. The British Lion annually drops in at all our
kennels, and takes from each a little bit of biscuit for his royal lunch;
and now I think of it, coming across the Mountains of Rasselas, why
BRITANNIA’s triumphant car is drawn by the “dogs of war.” Who
after this will dispute our claim to parliamentary honours? I pause
for a reply. Faithfully yours,
Lord of the Isles, RASPER.

MARKING A GENTLEMAN IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE.
GENTLEMEN who are not averse from being marked in a railway
carriage, but on the contrary, rather like it, may gratify their desire at
the small cost of one penny, unless, like “ j. C.B.” †. writes to the
Standard, they ...iſhappen to be as badly treated as was that cor-
respondent, at Market Harborough. Here is “J. C. B.”’s letter to our
excellent contemporary:-
To the Editor of the “Standard.”
Sir, When stopping at Market ºf Station this morning about
10:30, on my way from Leicester to town, I asked the proper man (not to
mistake him, he appeared a young man of eighteen or nineteen, no whiskers)
for a Standard, and was told in reply that he had none. I asked if he had
sold them all, and was told in reply that he had. I was obliged to have
recourse to a Daily Telegraph, and whilst he was handing me that anti-con-
stitutional organ, I descried a copy of your journal in his bundle. I took
possession of it, and informed the man that I should make the fact known at
your office to-day,
Travellers surely ought not to have to search a newsvendor's bundle to
obtain a copy of the only journal which marks a gentleman in a railway
carriage. I am, Sir, &c.,
London, July 29. J.
Everybody would not have been as determined as “J. C. B.,” who,
having travelled from Leicester as far, as unto Market Harborough
station without being able to get himself marked as a gentleman, was
near being foiled by “the proper man”—a very improper man, we
should say—but succeeded in procuring the cheap and only proof of
gentility on its travels. Well done, “J. C. B.' "

YES, FOR “JOSEPH'-AND HIS BASE BRETHREN.
THE Music Hall gentry had a great gathering the other day, for a
Yº. which we should approve, if we did not hold that the Music
Hall, as at present conducted, is so pestilent a nuisance that charity
can have nothing to say to it. One of the performers had grace or
shame enough to deliver some doggerel in which he deprecated the
wrath of Punch, on the ground that everybody must live. It is the
}. usually heard in the dock, and the answer is, “Yes; but decently.”
ut, as it is of no use telling the Music Hall folks what gentlemen
think of them, perhaps they would like to know what the respectable
artisan thinks º them, and of the spirit in which it is not impossible
that, he, may deal with them. , Here are the words ºf the organ of
hundreds of thousands of the skilled artisans and the Trades' Unions,
in fact, and we recommend them to special attention:—
“To these glaring temples of dissipation our youth are nightly attracted;
where they are being gradually trained to drinking habits; where their minds
are debased by the low songs and vulgar exhibitions provided for them ; and
where their morals are undermined and corrupted by cºntact with loose asso-
ciates, when their blood is fired and their brains hemuddled with drink. . . .
The expenditure incurred in those places of amusement keeps young men
poor; causes marriage to be greatly postponed—to the increase of vice; or, if
entered into, without the necessary provision for making a comfortable home;
while the habits they acquire by going there will too frequently cause them to
neglect home and family for their nightly amusements. The temptations of
those places have also too frequently caused persons to have recourse to unlaw-
ful means for gratifying them; and too often to forfeit place, trust, position,
and character. That the young should seek amusement is natural, and that
the man of toil also should at times seek relaxation and enjoyment after the
labour of the day; but the great evil is in permitting those amusements in
connection with public-houses—nay, to license those places in preference to
places of amusement unassociated with drink. . . . To license, in connection
with them, music, singing, farce, and folly, to beguile the young and thought-
less, and to lead them into habits of drunkenness and vice in life's earliest
spring, is a disgrace to the magistrates that license them, the Government
that sanctions, and the Legislature that permits them. The publican interest
is already the corrupting curse of many of our towns and villages."
So says the Beehire, speaking the sentiments of the Working Man.
We do not think that he will see much force in the mewing plea of
“must live.”
ZADKIEL ON THE PAST.
- Meteorologists have questioned whether the moon
has anything to do with the weather. Perhaps it has as much as the
stars have; and that is a great deal. Read old ZAD KIEL's
“WEATHER PREDICTIoss, July, 1868 –Storms, hail, and thunder at first;
3rd and 4th, rain ; high winds, thunder, fair intervals; 6th and 7th cool,
some rain ; 8th to 11th, fair, dry air; 13th and 14th, heat, lightning, and
meteors; 15th and 16th, rain and thunder prevail; 18th and 19th, fairer;
21st, violent thunderstorms all through the land; 23rd, cloudy: 25th, very
unsettled; 27th and 28th, misty, drizzling rain prevails; 30th and 31st, cool
and cloudy. Much rain this month, and on the 21st day riolent thunder;
deaths frequent by lightning.”
Observe, the concluding italics of the foregoing prophecy are ZAn-
KIEL’s own. What are lic, meant to imply: When one man says to
another, with reference to anything disagreeable to him which that
other is going to get, or intends doing, “Much good may it do you,”
we know what he means. ZADKIEL's meaning was the same as that
when he announced “Much rain this month.” Obviously.
Seeing what a hit has been made by ZAnkiel, in foretelling the
drought, we should be prepared to find his exactness equally instanced
in the prediction of future events. But herein ZAnkiel is transcen-
dental. After having distanced MERLIN, and outshone the very
lucidity of clairvoyance in foreshowing the weather we were to have in
July, he excels even himself by enumerating under the heading of
“Voice of the Stars,” this startling item of things to come in August:-
“At 5 h. 11 m. 30s. A.M., on the 18th, there will be a new Moon (a total
eclipse of the Sun) in about 25°28' of Leo. This will overthrow the power of
Theopolº in Abyssinia, and open up his country to civilisation.”
'Fore Heaven this is a more excellent prophecy than the other! The
total eclipse of the Sun in Leo, due on the 18th instant, and destined
to smash Thronohe, was, in effect, whilst anticipated, retrospective.
This is a new thing in Astrology. Truly we perceive ZAnkiel, is a
conjuror. His credit amongst the farmers and others who believe in
him will doubtless be greatly reinforced by the astonishing success of
his divinations, above exemplified, for July and August.
Right again
Fortunate on the Whole.
MR. DisrAELI's Tragedy of Alarcos has many of the faults of a young
poet, but it deserved better treatment than it has received. It is some.
thing to indite an intellectual drama, though an imperfect one. But
he is to be congratulated on one thing. Had the play succeeded, we
should have had several burlesques entitled Hºhat-a-Larkos.

ady’s keen eyes detect the fellow at Lewes Races, and he
º gets six weeks with hard labour, a fortnight more than
most ruffians get for brutal assaults on women, and not
º more than, comparisons aside, he deserves. But we hope
that MR. CRAwsHAw is not unduly proud of his own
cleverness. Punch might not have mentioned it, but has
no kindly feeling for folks who encourage dirty nuisances,
and he would be glad that everybody who does it were
fined £1 as MR. H. C. has been.

Of the egg daily brought º the bird to him,

A short-cut to millions occurred to him.
If his goose thus could lay one gold egg every day,
For him to put by in his būreau,

On some Southern Line of his region,
Who accustomed his public to humbug or hector,

squirt you can possibly get. Take each fly separately, and pressing his
cheek-bones gently, force him to open his mouth. Then squirt in

SIR,-Are humming-birds ever seen in England? Yesterday evening
I saw a small creature which at first I took for a wopps: then for a
| moth : but on closer inspection I found it to be uncommonly like a
small bird, with wings and bright sort of shot-silk body. It had eyes
as brilliant as toads, and it worked itself along not by its wings but by
the tail, which acted on the º of the screw-propeller. I heard
it humming to itself, but could not clearly distinguish the air, I fancy
it was a reminiscence of “Not for Joseph.” Was this a humming-
bird P Jos. Mopps.

[What you saw was an insect not uncommon in these islands... It
was not a humming-bird, though in some respects, resembling that
ornithological species. Just as the Lady-bird is a link between the
insect and bird world, being named equally “Lady-bird” or “May-
bug,” so this insect you saw we have not the slightest doubt is not
a humming-bird but a “ Hum-bird,” or, more commonly speaking, a
“Hum-bug.”—Sp. Ed.]

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HYMEN AND LOW MEN.
ONE of the most rampant forms which Snobbism assumes, is the way
in which the fact of a relationship with Swells is publicly paraded in
advertisements of marriage. If the bridegroom be remotely related to
a lord, or the bride's jº. be third cousin of a bishop,
mention specially is made of this delightful circumstance, although the
families concerned are sure to be aware of it, and it can hardly have
much interest for society at large. -
Descending in the social scale, this Snobbism assumes a form which
is more practical, and often serves as an advertisement for those who
by the etiquette of their º; are not allowed to advertise their
whereabouts, or puff publicly their works. Thus, for instance, our
attention is directed to the fact that the bridegroom's second cousin is
the famous DR. BoLUs, whose titles are paraded with great elabora-
tion: or a reference is lugged in to the brother of the Bride, in order
that his treatise upon bunions, bricks, or boilers, may be publicly
announced.
If this fashion spreads much further, small tradesmen will soon follow
in the footsteps of the Swells, and advertisements of marriages will be
F. used as a means of making known the whereabouts of ware-
ouses and specialities of shops. The lº will proclaim himself
the son of MR. BugGINs, of the noted firm of BUGGINs, BADGER,
BRow NAND BugGINs, whose Emporium of Fashion stands conspicuous
in Whitechapel, and will shortly be augmented by a branch at the
West End. The fair bride will announce that she is the only daughter
of MR. EPHRAIM CoRDURoy, of the old-established house of CoRDUROY
AND CADGER, whose reversible ten-shilling trousers were honourably
mentioned at the Paris Exposition, and whose guinea mungo overcoats
are worthy of all fame.
Dropping to another round in the commercial ladder, we may see
announced the fact that MR.TIMOTHY TRotter, º New
Cut, has espoused Miss SUSAN SwePTBREAD, daughter of the late
Josian Swºrpiºn, of East Smithfield; and the worldwill beinformed
that his business as a pork-butcher, is carried on triumphantly by his
desponding widow, by whom the largest ordeys will *. thankfully
received. Or, ha ſy, some fine morning we may see this notice paraded
in the Houndsditch Halfpenny Gazette :-
“On the 11th inst., at Bethesda Chapel, Minories, by the Rev. MR. STIG-
GINs, assisted by the REv. LUKE O'BLARNEY, uncle of the bride, SAMUEL
SRUNK, EsquiBE, alias ‘SLIMY SAMMY,’ Retail Rag Merchant, Black Doll
Street, to SUKEY ALEXANDRA, youngest daughter of BILL SIKES, EsquiBE,
late of Seven Dials, but now of Portland Prison.

ELECTION ADDRESSES.
I. —TREMENDOUSLY TORY.
To the Worthy and Independent Electors and Freemen of Great
Briborough.
GENTLEMEN, -
A NUMEROUs and influential deputation from your loyal and
ancient, Borough, now by reckless legislation unjustly deprived of one
of its Members, having honoured me with an invitation to present
myself as a Candidate for your representation in the ensuing Parliament
I, accept the flattering proposition with feelings of equal pride an
pleasure, and hasten to place my humble services at your entire disposal.
Being personally a stranger to you, a brief and temperate statement
of my political opinions may not be deemed inappropriate, especially at
a time when masks are worn and coats turned, when traitors abound,
and men hesitate to show themselves in their true colours.
I glory in the name of Tory, and firmly believe that England was
never so great at home, never so feared abroad, as when her Councils
were swayed by statesmen who bore such illustrious names as ADDING-
ToN, CASTLEREAGH, ELDoN, and LIVERPool. In the present deplorable
dearth of rulers of their unwavering consistency and unshaken
attachment to the Altar and the Throne, I must be content to support
Her Majesty’s existing Government, as the sole barrier, the only bul-
wark, between us and anarchy and Mr. Brigin.
On the all-absorbing question of the hour and the day, I am firm as
a rock, steadfast as a tower. I will hearken to no compromise, I will
listen to no surrender. I regard with feelings, in which horror and
contempt struggle for, the mastery, the sacrilegious, impious, unprin-
cipled and "... assault upon the State Church in Ireland
and solemnly pledge myself that the rights, emoluments, perquisites, and
privileges of every, stipendiary, dignitary of that venerable establish-
ment, from the highest Archbishop to the humblest sexton, shall ever
find in me a devoted champion and supporter. I tremble to think of
what might follow in this our beloved country, if the plot and con-
spiracy of MR. GLADSTONE and his heterogeneous band were unhappily
to succeed, and dare not trust myself to contemplate the possibility of
the existence of our own Deans and Chapters, so dear to us by a thou-
sand ties and hallowed associations, being menaced with gradual
extinction.
I think the House of Lords perfection: I regard the presence of the
Bishops in that august assembly as one of the Palladiums of our
lorious Constitution, and only regret that the Bishop of SoDoR AND
#. all Irish, Scotch, and Colonial Prelates are debarred from
seats in the Upper
latitudinarian age.
Those time-honoured institutions of our common country, in which
daring...democrats and licentious levellers pretend they can discern
anomalies and abuses, I cherish with feelings of unmixed pride and
satisfaction; and will resist to the utmost all insidious attempts to de-
prive us of what the wisdom of our ancestors devised, and the prudence
of our forefathers, maintained in inviolate integrity. Our National
Debt, our Public Expenditure, our Naval and Military administration,
our system of promotion by purchase in the Army, our Bankruptcy
Laws and Chancery Suits, our Diplomatic Service, our Ecclesiastical
discipline, our Educational arrangements, our Religious Disabilities, our
Universities and Endowed Schools, our Game Laws, our Grand Juries,
our Cathedral Establishments, our Agricultural Labourers, our Poor
Law, our Vestries, our Turnpikes and Treadmills, are all in turn the
; of my unqualified admiration and respect; and the audacious
political adventurer who may dare to lay but a single finger on a single
stone of that edifice of our Constitution, which has been alike the
admiration of ages and the envy of the world, will arouse my unflinch-
ini antagonism, and provoke my undying hostility.
will not outrage your feelings by allusions to such un-English topics
as the ballot, the law of primogeniture, the Bribery Bill, reduction of
our National armaments, and compulsory, education. Bachelor and
Lieutenant-Colonel as I am, I cannot regard with an eye of favour the
participation of women in the Électoral Franchise.
When returned by you as your honoured º you will
hear me, in this great crisis of our National History, in my place in
Parliament, rallying round the Throne, defending our Altars i #.
nailing my colours to the mast, upholding Church and State, advo-
cating no Surrender, guarding the bulwarks of our Constitution, sound-
ing i. tocsin, uttering watchwords and words of * J.
our ancient landmarks, stemming the advancing tide of democracy
manfully resisting the thin end of the wedge, and unfurling that proud
Conservative banner, which has for its inspiring motto, “Stare super
antiquas vias /?” -
Freemen! your immemorial rights I will protect as amongst the
brightest jewels of the British Crown; and to all, Freemen and Inde-
pendent Electors, I say in conclusion, a long pull, a strong pull, and a
pull altogether, and victory is ours
I have the honour to be, Gentlemen
Your obedient humble Servant,

THE MAN WITH AN EAR WHO PIAYS BY IT.-SECOND
SPECIES OF THE GENUS.
AFTER dinner the Guv commences politics; that is, he gives me the
result of his reading during the day, which embraces the opinions of
the Times, the Telegraph, Daily News, and Standard—a political salad
which we mix with our own oil, vinegar, and Attic salt, if any at table.
My long-lost Cousin trifles with the decanters, which always seem to
be “forming” in front of him; and presently, not being interested,
º: in any question of the day, slips a little way down in his
chair, gives himself his head, and falls asleep. Being aroused in order
to pass the wine, he jº, himself together for the purpose of filling
his own glass (the largest, claret size), and having forwarded the
decanters a stage, like the Parliamentary bills we are discussing, col-
lapses, again, and slumbers... My, relative, gives me “himself on the
Times,” I return with “myself on the Standard,” and so on.
We exhaust the topics of the day, including the City article and
markets. I beat him easily on markets, as he never thinks of reading
them, and I have the movements of the Army and Navy at my fingers'
ends, this being a part of the paper he can’t manage at all. As he
doesn’t contradict . of my statements about hops, grey shirtings
calicoes, twist, the embarkation of troops for New South Wales, an
the orders from the Horse Guards as to the movements of the House-
hold troops from Windsor to Hounslow, I have the talking all to my-
self for a good ten minutes, managing it judiciously and slowly.
At five minutes to ten my relative has a pain in his back, and goes
out of the room, and is not seen again by me till the next morning,
when he will probably inform me that he hasn’t slept a wink all night.
The night .. one of these complaints I happened to pass his door
on a late visit to the library. If ever I heard a man snore, my relative
was that man. I suppose there is no smoke without fire, and no
snoring without sleep. I re-passed his room an hour and a half after
this, and the snoring was as heavy and regular as before. When we met
in the morning he said, as usual, that he hadn't slept a wink all night.
Now, what possible amusement could my relative find in lying awake
and snoring P. Can a man snore himself to sleep? Can he induce
sleep, gentle sleep, to visit him by correct imitation ? Or I catch him
on the horns of a dilemma–if he wasn't snoring, who was 2
Not I: and there are no other bed-rooms near his. Do I ask him
this?-no, I do not. I like Drouzemoor-Ripple, and its ease and com-
fort; therefore I amuse myself with these queries, and am content to let
my ºld relative think that I am taken in by his constant sleepless
nights.
The above digression occupies me while my long-lost Cousin is waking.
First he opens his eyes, and looks very wide awake for two seconds;
then he shuts them suddenly, and is very much asleep for five seconds;
then he re-opens them, shakes his head, and draws himself up in the
chair; then he stretches himself, hitting out vigorously left and right,
.
and screwing his head about as if it was new and inconvenient to him.
Then he laughs at me shortly: I smile. Then he asks me, as if suddenly
alive to some neglect on his part of the laws of hospitality, if I’ll take
any more wine? I won't—he does—throwing off a º: of glasses
of sherry—“whitewash” he calls it—easily, and rising from his chair
proposes “a smoke” in his room. This, falling in with my notion of
comfort, I agree to it; but place before him “my room” as an amend-
ment of the original motion.
All the same to him (a very pleasant, unselfish fellow my long-lost
Cousin, I think to myself); my room be it.
Why do I choose my room, and why appreciate the unselfishness of
the long-lost P
Because I can get as far as my dressing-gown and slippers, sit in my
own particular seat (every man in his own room has a right, by cour:
tesy, to his own particular seat), and when I'm tired I can “turn in,”
which, gives the hint to your visitor to turn out. Or if he will stay,
his talking will send me to sleep, and his promise to put out the candle
relieves me from all anxiety.
Being in the country my window is open, so that I shan’t be sleep-
ing in tobacco-smoke, and the amount of that fumigation in the room
is 3. enough to keep away insects. A pipe ought, to have been
included among Titania's directions for protecting the slumbers of her
donkey-headed Bottom. Being, as I have before stated, something of
an invalid–really I mean, and not only upon my relative's account—it

everything, that I should go to bed º
Had I suspected for an instant that I had suddenly stumbled upon
the second species of the Man with an Ear, I should have thought
twice before suggesting my room, and then I shºuldn't have suggested it.
We go up-stairs. Our rooms are divided from one another by
another spare room, where there is no one sleeping at present.
FRED, my long-lost Cousin, is so glad I’m here—I’m so glad, I say,
that he is here. I can't say more; and when two men meet, (relations
mind you) after an interval of ten years, it’s, rather odd if the inter-
change of experiences is not both amusing and interesting.
I am under the impression that my Cousin has been to Gibraltar
Malta, Italy, Sicily, Norway, Sweden, Holland, Africa, America, an
Canada, not to mention, a long stay in Ireland and a short one in

tire wºks ºr more. "The information will be,” i say to myself,
wrapping myself in my dressing-gown, “served up hot and hot; or,”
I say, changing my trope, “the fresh-gathered fruits of recent travel.”
So lighting my pipe, and putting aside Plutarch, Vol. IV., Montaigne,
Count XAvieR DE MAISTRE's Morks, SchEMMELING's Semific Races,
DuNN's Commerce and European Finance, BAcox's Essays, Von DUL-
LERMAN On the Hebrew Particles, and The Four Books ºf Confucius,
I await the entrance of my long-lost Cousin.
A tap at the door. “Come in " Enter the butler, carrying a large tray
with tumblers, spoons, glasses, sugar, bottles of spirits, bottles of wine,
bottles of soda and Seltzer water, enough apparently fºr a large party.
“MR. FREDERick said as I was to bring these in here, Sir,” says
PHIBBs, the butler, looking about for space on the table, and getting
the thin end of the tray into DuNN's European Finance, as a hint to me
to assist him in clearing the table. Bacon, Hebrew Particles, Mon-
taigne, Confucius, and my other friends are replaced by brandy, gin,
whiskey, sherry, Hollands, sugar, and various waters.
“There was indeed a tap at the door,” I say to my Cousin when he
looks in to see if “the stuff” is all right. Anything to drink he calls
“stuff,” no matter what the quality of the liquor may be. By the way,
he doesn’t see my little funniment about the word “tap;” but only
replies, “Oh, it’s come up all right. Now, PHIBBs, you can go to
bed.” Exit PHIBBs. To me—“I’ll put on my smoking-coat, and come
in for some stuff.” I say, “Make haste,” as I have half finished my
allowance of one pipe before bed-time, and I wanted to take it with his
experiences of foreign countries,and peoples during the last ten years.
He leaves my door open, and goes humming down the passage. What
time it is I cannot exactly determine ºf think the same as he hummed
at dinner—“Marble Halls,” with a dash of “Home, Sweet Home,” and
something else. It reminds me of BILsco MBE for a minute, but I
dismiss all thoughts of Men with Ears from my mind.
MistER FRED returns. In such a smoking-coat!—made, apparently,

Gigantic roses, enormous dandelions, sp themselves in folds over
his body, and in fact the barest apartment couldn't be unfurnished as
long as he was sitting in it. He is chair-covers, sofa-covers, rug, cur-
tains, and carpet, all in one. They are big enough to hold three
cousins, being cut on the made-for-growing principle.
“You like it?” he asks, alluding to the suit.
I candidly answer that I don't know whether I do or not, being
dazzled by it. My Cousin hums to himself while I inspect the dress
from my chair.
“I’ve got another,” he informs me, “all lions and tigers.”
I suppose, I say, that he brought it with him from abroad—Turkey,
perhaps. I throw this out, hoping that thereby hangs a tale of exciting
adventure and thrilling interest.
“No,” says he: “Piccadilly.”
It is at this moment I perceive for the first time that he is carrying
an odd-shaped black box fastened by brass catches.
hi “Liqueurs, eh? More ‘stuff?’” I ask, smiling at my quotation from
ilm.
“No,” he returns, brightening up more than I have seen him do
since his arrival—“my cornet.” - -
“Do you ſº ”. I ask. But why this question? Does a man carry
cornopeans about with him when he can’t play P Does any one in his
senses lug about with him a violoncello when he is ignorant of the art
of scraping its strings? -
An answer flashes through my mind with telegraphic velocity,
startling me like galvanism. An answer, do I say? The answer—the
only answer—to the above queries.
Yes. The very time when a man, in his senses too, does carry about
a cormopean, or any other musical instrument, with him, is when he
can't play, and is (Gracious powers, how it flashes on me!) LEARNING
To Do so!
I anticipated his answer. “You are learning it?”
“No,” he replied (thank Heaven for that, as far as it goes I
thought to myself); “I only have a master when I want to learn some
particular tune, because I have a difficulty over notes.”—(Here he begins
screwing on a mouth-piece, and shaking nothing out of the bell end of
the cornet.) “I always have had a difficulty since I first began.”
“When was that P* I ask, hoping for the best.
“Ten years ago,” is his answer, which, so far, is satisfactory. A
musical man in ten years' time can't be so very bad a performer on any
instrument he has studied.
“No,” says he, after giving a blast through it, to try the A crook-
piece, which pierced my ears, “I’m no great hand at notes: I almost
always PLAY BY EAR.”
The Hour had come, and the Man!
“Now,” says hº playfully, “mix your liquor, and "I'll give you a
toon on the corny."
I grip my chair as if he was going to blow me off it, stare at him
helplessly, and then he commences The -

UNDER the heading of “Railway Spite”, a correspondent of the
Times says, with especial reference to the North Kent Line:—
“Since the railway fares have been raised, many gentlemen have travelled
third class. The railway people, however, with great ingenuity, manage to
pay us out in this way; they incommode the few who have paid for first-class
tickets and accommodation by introducing into their first-class carriages the
ordinary holders of third-class tickets, who smoke, spit, swear, and make
themselves generally disagreeable.”
So then, because many decent people choose to travel third, class
rather than submit to extortion, the Railwaymen are doing all, they
possibly can to drive all of them into third-class carriages. If this is
spite on the Railwaymen's part, is it not cutting off their noses to spite
}. faces They seem to have borrowed a hint from the Irishmen,
who, owing a banker a grudge, made a demonstration against him by
burning his notes. -

THE POLITE ELECTION.
(A Model, respectfully recommended to the attention of all the
Constituencies.)
EGARDING the election
of a Member of Par-
liament for the bo-
rough of Pax-cum;
Wobis as a credit and
honour to the British
nation, we give a
somewhat fuller re-
port of it than has
appeared in other
journals. There were
two candidates, who,
though professing
opposite olitics,
could hardly be
called antagonists,
they having con-
ducted their canvass
together, and having
throughout it dis-
º all the most
indly and brotherly
feelings, an example
which had a highly
beneficial effect upon
the borough. }.
Honourable WELVET
BLAND, son of LoRD HONEYBALL, was the Conservative candidate,
and the Liberal interest was represented by MR. GENTLE SMILER,
the opulent owner of the Treacleton estates, near Pax-cum-Wobis.
The nomination took M. in front of the Assembly Rooms on
Tuesday. The worthy Mayor, MR. JENIAL Sole, an eminent fish;
monger, presided. The respected Vicar, the Rev. DR. HARMONY, and
the leading Dissenting minister, the Rev. Moses MEEK, who was
driven into town in MRs. HARMONY’s basket carriage, and by that lady
herself, accompanied the Mayor upon the hustings. Proceedings Were
commenced by MR. MEEK's reading the Prayer. Book collect for peace,
and we may as well add that they were closed by DR. HARMoxy's
giving out the hymn, “Let dogs delight,” from the Congregational
Hymn-Book. The Mayor made a brief speech, in which he said that
it was needless to ask those whom he saw before him to preserve the
utmost amity and concord, as quarrels, even at election time, were
unknown in their happy borough; but he would just express his hope
that in the eagerness of all to exhibit good fellowship, after the nomi-
nation, they would bear in mind that the head in the morning some:
times accused the heart of being over-gushing over-night. He hoped
that such a hint, coming from a fishmonger, would not be considered
out of plaice (Roars of laughter and applause), or offishus (Renewed
laughter), as he should be sorry to ſºuſ: in the discharge of his duty.
The wit of the excellent Mayor increased the good-humour of the
meeting, and the crowd arranged itself with the utmost consideration,
the shorter persons being invited to stand in front, that they might see
the better. Three cheers were then given for the ladies in the balcony,
which were acknowledged gracefully, with bows from MRs. SMILER,
the wife of the candidate, and (with some little modest hesitation) from
Miss DARLING, who sat by the former, and to whom MR. BLAND is
engaged.
R. SYRUp (grocer) then º MR. BLAND, and said that, with
two such candidates, it was of little consequence which he had the
honour to nominate; but, having for many years supplied grocery to
LoRD HoNEY BALL, and as MR. BLAND might remember, Everton Toffy
to the junior branches of that noble house (laughter; and MR. BLAND
said, laughing, “Very, good toffy, too. I wish I had some now”)
he, Mr. SYRUP, had thought it not inappropriate that he should pro-
pose that gentleman. He could hardly give him higher praise than
in saying that he was worthy to be a fellow-candidate with their friend
}", º MR. SMILER. (Applause, and MR. SMILER raised
28 ſtaf.
MR. ANODYNE (chemist) seconded the nomination, and said that,
whatever might be the result of the election, he was sure that every.
body would be delighted. . . Speeches were a drug, and the only one
he, a druggist, did not dealin, but as a vendor of scent he would give
them a scentiment: “May the perfume of politeness ever sweeten the
pockethandkerchief of patriotism l’’ (Loud cheers.)
MR. SILK NAPPER (hatter) proposed MR. GENTLE SMILER, and said
that the Borough was so fortunately situated, that it could not go
wrong, but that perhaps it would go a little more right in electing MR.
SMILER, as he was married and settled, and could give all his time to
their interests; whereas a little bird had told him that, for a couple of
months, perhaps, MR. BLAND might be occupied in reference to
to forfeit my word, and therefore, you will do as you please.
|another union than that of England and Ireland, though it might also
be said to be a Church question. (Great applause.) He hoped that he
had taken no liberty; for, if he thought he had done so, it would make
him as mad as the proverbial hatter. (MR. BLAND. “ Not at all, MR.
NAPPER.”)
MR. FETHER BEd.D (furniture maker) said that, in seconding MR.
SMILER, he discharged an office which made him very happy, but he
wished that the wisdom of Parliament had left them two M embers, for
two better men could not be found than the two before them. How-
ever, he hoped that the one they did not choose would soon get a seat
elsewhere, and if he had the stuffing it, the honourable Member should
not complain that it was not soft. (Much cheering.)
The MAYor then looked at the candidates, but neither seemed inclined
to take precedence.
C MR. BLAND. Only a little older, MR. SMILER, but still the older man.
Ome.
MR. SMILER. The son of a nobleman, my dear young friend. Please
begin.
§. BLAND. The best manners is to do as you are bid, but I am
really ashamed to be the first to address you. Gentlemen Electors—for
all the electors of Pax-cum-Wobis are gentlemen—I feel that if I were
to advise you in this matter, I should conscientiously recommend you
to select my friend MR. SMILER, for though he cannot be more attached
than I am to the institutions of our country, or more devoted than I
am to the interests of our beloved borough, he has the advantage of
years and experience. But, “situated as I am,” as you heard MRs.
GERMAN REED sing so delightfully when she favoured us with a visit,
ū. will allow me to put my modesty in my pocket, from which, as you
now, I have drawn no other arguments in my favour, and to say that
I should much like to be your Member. My dear old father would
like it, and a young lady not a hundred miles off would like it, and I
am not without hope that you would like it also. But I earnestly beg
that you will be guided b |. own discretion and your own con-
science. One advantage y ave over my opponent, or rather I will
say, my valued friend. This is a great advantage, and lithink, though
it may be ungrateful to say so, that it, ought to give me the victory.
My valued friend has promised, should you elect me, to afford me in
private the benefit of his best advice on all public questions. I leave
the rest in your hands. (Loud and long-continued cheering.)
A Voice. Ten thousand pardons, and indeed it’s of no consequence,
but the honourable candidate has omitted to mention his politics.
MR. BLAND. Ten thousand thanks, rather, for reminding me. So I
have. Well, you know, I would not say a word against MR. GLAD-
ston E. (Cheers.) He is a splendid orator, a thoroughly honest and
earnest man, a real friend to the Church, and one of whom we are all
roud; but it so happens —well, as a rule, I should like to vote with
MR. DiskAELI. (Cheers, and cries of “Nothing can be manlier.”)
MR. SMILER. Upon my soul, Gentlemen, I think that you had better
choose my gallant young friend, BLAND. He has spoken to-day in a
way that makes me feel I am doing an unjust, and almost an unkind
thing, in offering you a choice. What does it matter to me whether I
come in or not? I live near you. (Cheers.) I know you all (Cheers.)
I shall see you very often. (Cheers.) And it is not the adventitious
circumstance of being łº". Member that can draw us closer together.
And, as he has frankly told you, he shall have the benefit of my
advice, paleat quantum. § iſ having undertaken to give you the
option, it would be inconsistent with my habits as a man of business
I should
prefer your electing him. But if you like, take me for a Session, for I shall
certainly retire in his favour when he, too, shall have settled down into
the sedate happiness I enjoy with yonder good woman. (Loud cheers.)
I may as well say that I ſold MR. DisrAEL (cheers) to be one of the
most remarkable men of the day. Self-made, he has attained the
leadership of a party not over-fond of men from the ranks, and he has
shown º, political talents, while his books, are, I believe
among the most brilliant of fictions. But, on the whole, I should
º; to go into the lobby with MR. GLAdstone. (Cheers from all
sides.)
No other candidate being proposed, the Mayor asked whether a poll
were demanded ?
MR. BLAND. Couldn’t we draw lots?
MR. SMILER. Or toss up
The MAYor. I'm afraid, Gentlemen, that we must go on in the old
way. My return made on the writ that MR. BLAND had drawn
“Seated,” or that MR. Swiler had cried “Woman, and it Was,” would
scarcely content the SPEAKER.
A CoARse Voice. Let 'em fight for it.
There was a painful sensation in the assembly, but MR. ANopyNE,
with great presence of mind, sprang from the hustings, and, rushing to
the offender, administered to him a large dose of chloroform. He was
speedily rendered insensible, and was conveyed to the Dove and Olive
Inn, the landlord of which undertook to have him severely pumped
upon by-and-by.
MR. BLANd. He's a stranger, poor fellow. Give him some dinner,
and send him away. I may treat him, as he's not an elector.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. SMILER. And give him half-a-crown—here it is.
This was the only unpleasant incident of the day. . It was arranged
that a poll should be taken, and on the Wednesday it began at 10.
Until the close the carriages and other vehicles of the neighbourhood
were impartially used to convey electors to the poll, Conservatives
driving up Liberals, and Liberals returning the civility, and the soli-
citors on both sides were incessant in imploring voters not to think of
anything but the interests of the country. The utmost courtesy pre-
valled at the hustings, and when there was any crowd, the cry “New
elector” instantly caused way to be made for the novice. The candi-
dates lunched in each other's rooms all day, and suggested to each
other the names of voters who had not arrived. At four o'clock it was
known which had been chosen, but by common consent it was agreed
that nothing should be said about it until next day, and both candidates
had a bespeak at the theatre that night, the performances being The
Itivals and The Two Gentlemen of Pair-cum-Mobis.
The declaration was made on Thursday, when the Mayor announced
the num to be
Smiler 589
Bland 588
Majority for Smiler l
MR. BLAND insisted on returning thanks for his friend. The electors
could not have made a better choice. He heartily congratulated them
and if he could identify the one voter who turned the scale, he would
ask him to dinner for six weeks. (Cheers.) -
MR. SMILER, M.P., said that he thought they had not made a mis-
take, because his friend could now go away and be married, and come
back ready to serve them far better than he, MR. SMILER, could. But
in the meantime he would do his best. He called for nine cheers for
MR. BLAND, and a lady who should be nameless. They were heartily
given.
MR. BLAND called for eighteen cheers for a lady who should not be
nameless, for she bore the honoured name of the wife of the honour-
able Member for Pax-cum-Wobis. When the applause had ceased, there
was a general cry for “Flowers,” and the Mayor, the Speakers, and
the hustings were overwhelmed with showers of bouquets, which were
descending when our parcel was made up for the rail.

Danby. I, say, old fellow, you look anxious. What's the matter?
Drawl. My friend, I am thoughtful. Let me confide in you. Listen.
You know I’m engaged, and to whom -
Danby. Yes, to be sure. You are going to be married next month.
Drawl. Yes-(hesitates)—I was.
Danby. Is there anything wrong? -
Drawl. I have every reason to believe that SAM BLUBB is very fond
of Louis A.
Danby. What, jealous P. And of little fat BLUBB P
Drawl. Oh, dear no!, I didn't say that Louisa was fond of SAM
BLUBB. But I’m afraid that SAM BLUBB would be likely to make her
a deuced deal better husband than ever I shall.
Danby. Why so? - -
Drawl. Poor little sentimental beggar, he loves her to distraction.
Danby. And don’t you? - -
Drawl. Not to distraction. I fear SAM BLUBB is worthier of her
than I am.
Danby. Why, you’re talking sentiment yourself! You have scruples
about your feelings towards a girl with tin. .. -
Drawl. Ah! there you’ve hit it—that same tin, I thought I was in
for a good thing. My old Uncle said so—indeed the whole affair was
his suggestion.
Danby. What isn’t it all right, them.” - -
Drawl. Well, you see, most of the tin's to come. She'll be in for it
by-and-by, when an old woman dies; but those old women, when they
turn seventy, do go on living so long. However, it would be all right
enough some day-as the law now stands.
Danby. Then where’s the hitch -
Drawl. That confounded Married Women's Property Bill.
Danby. Why, it was thrown over long before the .#
Drawl. Yes; but suppose it passes in the blessed Reformed Parliament.
Danby. Suppose it does. - -
Drawl. Then what I want to know, before I plunge into matrimony,
is, will its operation be retrospective? Willit affect a fellow who marries
next month When Louis'A's old aunt dies, say five years hence, will
it cut me—if I’m her husband-out of the tin *
Danby. That’s more than I know.
Drawl. Everything depends upon that. . Because what should a
be quite content to remain as I am if I could afford to live as I like
without the "...# of unpleasant exertion. In fact, I’d rather.
Louis A is very good looking, and all that, and would suit me as well
as any other girl; but I’m not going to take a leap in the dark.
Danby. Can you help it?
Drawl. That’s a question, too. I don’t know if I should be able to
back out now if I wanted. Not that I positively do want: I'm only
uncertain. But if I did, it would be a neat way to retire in favour of
BLUBB. He for his part would be satisfied to gain her heart.
Danby. But you’re the man for her money.
Drawl. Precisely so; and if I married her, and didn’t get it, as I
expected to, I should be very unhappy. Then I should never, be able
to make her happy, even if I were to try. Now, BLUBB would try, at
any rate. I’m not at all sure she hadn't better let him. It all depends
upon what alteration will be made by that Married Women's Property
Act in my look-out.
Danby. Of course there is no foreseeing.
Drawl. Of course not. There is no prophet you can go to, even on
the Turf. The “sperrits” are all humbug. It’s a very puzzling

SABBATARIAN IGNORANCE.
THE Lords' Day Qbservance Society recently addressed a memorial
to the Brighton Railway Company against Sunday trains. Is not the
following extract a pretty specimen of a snuffle –
“Lastly, as recognising the Christian principle of a particular Providence,
we cannot conceal from ºurselves the conviction of the signal instances of the
Divine displeasure in two accidents on the Sabbath day, the one of which in
the Clayton tunnel ended in the hurrying of several lives in the moment of
time into eternity, and which, in a financial point of view, resulted in a loss
to the proprietary of an amount certainly not less than £50,000.”
The Christian principle of a particular Providence in cases of fatal
accident is illustrated by a memorial still standing in Christian records
though it fell bodily somewhere under two, thousand years ago, an
killed a number of people. The members of the Lord's Day Observance
Society seem not to be aware of the particulars mentioned in a certain
narrative about a tower which stood in a place in Syria called Siloam,
until it fell upon those people. Apparently, they are also as little con-
versant with modern newspapers, as with the ancient writings in which
that narrative occurs. Otherwise they would know that horse-races
near Paris, generally, if not always, take place on a Sunday, and steeple-
chases as well; notwithstanding which, no more necks are broken on
those occasions in France than there are in England. Does the Lords
Day Observance Society object to Sunday Schools? . Its con-
stituents would be wiser for some lessons which, peradventure, they
might be taught to read in those institutions. At present they appear
to be ignorant, of any history, sacred or profane, and even contem-
porary, evidently knowing no more about the Grand Prix than they do
about the Tower of Siloam.
LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.
“IGNORAMUs” is informed that the French novel called “Le Blocus.”
has not yet been translated into English with the title of “The Bloke.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MRS. PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HER DAUGHTER.
MY DEAR JUDIANA,
MR. PUNCH and the British Public have been so overcome with the
heat of the weather that I fear there is no present chance of the following
important questions receiving proper consideration at their hands:–
Firstly. Whether, on the whole, foreign travel is more satisfactory
than staying at home *
Secondly. How does MR. DARwiN, or the DUKE of ARGYLE and other
naturalists, account for the regular migration of the Swell and Snob
Tribe to certain foreign resorts at this season of the year 2
This made me so excessively nervous that I closed my Diary forth-
with, and as there was a good deal of jam-boiling going on in the
kitchen, I committed it, leaf by leaf, to the flames. I# ies addicted
to writing would often follow the same plan, I feel sure they would
experience the amount of relief that I ii. Has it come to this, then,
that I am a Snob in my husband's estimation? And if you and I are
Snobs, my poor unsophisticated JUDIANA, who is not? Have I given
utterance to the words that have dropped from the mouth of the
oracle, and remained all the time unwise P
I will fell you what we will do, my child: we will find out some
|Marine Utopia, free alike from Snobs, Swells, and Shams, from ladies
who paint their lips and cheeks, from fast novelists, and from those
Thirdly. What motive induces people of tolerably harmless manners who affect the manners of heroines of French plays. There we will
at home, to lead, French railway guards, policemen and other officials study the common objects of the sea-shore, and lead a life, so Arcadian,
such a terrible life of it, going exactly where the laws of His Imperial so inartificial and so poetic, that we shall prove to the world in general,
Majesty, forbids, them to go, ruffling the temper of His Imperial an
Majesty's official army in most unprovoked ways, and refractorily
persisting in their naughty ways even when under severe reproof. Poor
things—I mean the Custom-House Guards! I do pity them this warm
weather.
A hundred other questions I would gladly put to Mr. Punch and the
British Public, but the thermometer and humanity forbid. When the
weather has grown cool, I will consult the oracle; meantime, I proceed
with my comments on our journey, which might fairly fill a book, or
figure as A Summer with the Snohs or an Autumn with the Flirts on
MR. MUDIE's list, by the side of other works of satire and entertainment.
My Jupi ANA, must I confess it, in spite of your Papa's precautions,
in spite of the training I have had in my capacity of wife of the wisest
of men, in spite of a thousand things in my favour, I am not wise, and
on occasions, a goose.
Did I not set out on my travels with all sorts of aspirations? We
were not going to mix ourselves up with Snobs; we had yielded our
pet ambition, the Buttons, rather than indulge in a sham; we deter-
mined to show Mrs. and the Misses GRUNDY what models of prudence
and decorum Mrs. Punch and her daughter should be ; and without
tuft-hunting and toadying, pick up desirable acquaintances whenever
chance threw them in our way. -
Alas! when I compare my aspirations with my experiences, I could
almost die of mortification. What trophies of a brilliant campaign we
were to bring home : but let the following extracts from my diary and
Mr. Punch's comments thereon, read my daughter and her sex a lesson
on the Vanity of Woman's Wishes.
Neufchâtel, July 2nd–We have got so intimate with a charming
family of the highest rank, though not rich; there are five daughters,
and all so sweet and simple, and with such fresh youthful complexions—
one thinks they must all have been born on the same day—only I
suppose five twins were never yet heard of. And then there was no
pride about them, though their father was a Baronet, and titles were
is thick in their families as blackberries. Dear Lºy's new would
darn her daughters' stockings in the most winningly unpretentious
way, and say, when the holes were such as to shock one, “Dear Mrs.
Punch, do we not travel in order to wear out our old clothes?”
Mr. Punch. “Stuff and nonsense from beginning to end: those young
ladies have looked fresh and youthful for the last fifteen years. Paint
does it; and though they were so gushing abroad, they wouldn't know
you in 'London. Everything is sham about them but their fine name,
and they live on it—a sorry living, too. Proceed to the next entry.”
Here I made a feeble remonstrance. “In the matter of paint I do
think that you do those young ladies an injustice, my dear. I assure
i. . foreheads were as smooth and their lips as red as our own
ear girls’—”
Mr. Punch, “Which proves you know nothing about it, Mrs. Punch.
Red lips in these days are a delusion and a snare. Proceed.”
I read tremblingly.
Genera, July 6th.-A sweet charming young married lady has thrown
herself upon my protection, and borrowed money of me under the fol-
lowing circumstances. She had come abroad with her husband on a
wedding tour, and at some out-of-the-way junction he had got into the
wrong train, while she was looking after th. luggage, and had gone no
one knew where. He couldn't speak any foreign language whatever:
he had got all the money, and she was in great distress —
Mr. Punch. “And you believed the story, and (in a melancholy
voice) lent her money?”
“Did not humanity dictate P” I asked.
Mr. Punch. “Rarely, if ever, does humanity dictate that one should
lend money. Abroad, never ? Do the husbands of sweet charming
young ladies ever run away from them on their wedding tour P Choose
your company with more circumspection in future, and proceed.”
Willeneure, July 9th.-This is the most delightful boarding-house in
the world. LoRD CRotch ETT hands me down to dinner every day
with extreme politeness—
Here Mr. Punch made some remark that I did not catch, and I begged
him to say it again.
Mr. Punch. “I said Fudge, Mrs. Punch, and I repeat the observation.”
to Mr. Punch in particular, how entirely our Snobbishmess was
a foreign habit picked up on the way. -
You too, my daughter, will not there be cast into the shade, as you
were abroad § those highly accomplished and finished flirts we en-
cºntered everywhere. And that reminds me that some interesting
notes on the subject of flirts are irrevocably blazing under the jam-pot
– a warning to husbands of impatient temper |
n those lost records, I lamented, how bitterly only mothers can tell,
that things should be as they are, and not as we would have them to
Have I not brought up my daughter simply and modestly, with a
view to graces of mind rather than salient attractions of dress and
manner; but what follows? She is a century in advance of her age,
and is as much obscured by her companions as a primrose by tulips.
Who would be a GALILEo in a superstitious age; but was not his fate
light compared with that of modest Miss Punch in an age of flirts,
French plays, and MADAME RAchEL's cosmetics? But let us quit this
world for a time, and occupy our minds with the habits of barnacles
and jelly-fish and other simple pleasures. We will patronise the cheerful
sea-side donkey, and in the enjoyment of its frolicsome capers, forget
the existence of Vanity-Fair and all the mortifications thereof.

THE *TISER ON THE TIMES.
OUR frothy old friend of the Tap-tub, in discussing the substantial
grounds of the complaints against the preaching of the day, comes to
the melancholy conclusion that “the universal tendency of all thin
human is towards deterioration... We see this,” says the oracle of the
Licensed Victuallers, “in everything around us. In the place of CAN-
NING we have DisRAELI; in the place of PEEL we have GLADstone.
The chair of REYNoLps and Lawrence is filled by GRANT; MENDELs:
soHN's successor is STERNDALE BENNETT. So in religious places and
things. WESLEY and WHITFIELD have been followed by BuNTING and
: Punshon, and BUNTING and PUNshon have both left us, and are
followed by—we scarcely know whom. In the Church Newton and
CºgIL were followed by DANIEL WILson, and he by Stowell, and
MNEILE. Stowell is gone, and M'NEILE has relinquished his pulpit.
: All things seem to tend to dulness and mediocrity l’”
Not so. Most things undoubtedly do so tend. But one thing does
not deteriorate, and that is the Tiser. The oracle of the “Great
Metrolopus” is as brilliant, as original, as profound, as instructive as
ever.
Unlike the beer of its lords, the Licensed Wittlers, the tap of the
'Tiser still runs as g strong, stimulating and º; iquor as
ever—the same true blue, Protestant, Stingo—as sweet with the malt
of human kindness, and as tonic with the hop of high-principle as when
it was first drawn and distributed to its admiring publics.
The 'Tiser, alone, defies the law of “backwardation” it has discovered
and rises, daily, to higher flights of Wit and Wisdom, Patriotism and
Protestantism, love of Liberty, and the Licensing System, encourage-
ment of Virtue and the Wictuallers... A solitary exception to the
universal prevalence of decline and fall, the Tap-tub alone bears, like
a star, on its broad and benignant brow, its own exclusive motto-
“Excelsior!” or—in the language of the Li Wittlers whom it
cnlightens— Uppards!”

CONTRADICTION OF A MATRIMONIAL RUMOUR.
We are authorised to contradict a 'report that a union has been on
the tapis between a Divine of eminence and a daughter of the distin-
guished house of Wesley. Where there is smoke there is fire, how;
ever, and some grounds have been given for the rumour., The eminent
clergyman in question, having recently been unsuccessful in his court-
ship of a party of the Roman Catholic persuasion, had subsequently
turned his attention in the direction of the Dissenting family that
inherits the name of the founder of Methodism, as also the original
name of the Duke of WELLINGTON. His overtures were deemed un-
acceptable, not on account of any personal or mental disqualification, for

PUNCH*S HANDBOOK FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
The want of a complete, concise, and comprehensive Guide to the
more popular watering-places has long been felt. Black, Murray,
Bradshawe, &c., are too elaborate for these run-and-read days, whilst
the local Handbooks are fiſof what few care to know anything about.
Punch therefore feels sure no apology is needed for the following
descriptive pages.

independent manner. Old prejudices are dying out.

Sir Richard having renewed his absurd anti-dog proclamation, we suppose this will recent number of the Saturday Review, from seeing in its

A RAILWAY REFORM BILL WANTED.
IN an article about our railway highwaymen, the Pall
Mall Gazette made the following remarks, which we would
recommend electors to lay to heart before they pledge
their votes for next election:-
“The present strength of the companies is mainly attributable
to two facts—the accidental presence of so many directors in
Parliament, and the indifference to railway matters of so many
members who are not directors. Neither of these circumstances
is beyond the reach of human effort. The elector who travels
by rail may resolve never to vote for a director, or he may make
it a condition of giving his support to a candidate that he shall
help forward whatever legislation is needed to protect theinterests
of the public.”
Are you a Railway director? Yes. Then you shan’t
have my vote. This should be the way of dealing with a
candidate. And this would be the way of insuring against
such accidents as the “accidental presence” in our Par-
liament of so many Railway highwaymen that a reform in
railway matters is most difficult to get. Voting for a rail-
way-man is like voting for a robber, which no honest voter
surely would intentionally do. Having plundered all their
shareholders, the railway-men are bent now upon plunder-
ing the public; and as they have a thorough monopoly
of transit, there is small chance of the public escaping
from their clutches. However, fortunately Parliament can
undo what it has done, and possibly the first act of the
House elected under the Reform Act will be an “Act for
Abolition of Directorships of Railways, and Introduction
of more Honest and Efficient means of Management.”

A BENEFACTOR TO THE BRITISH NAVY.
Louis NApoleon has been a great benefactor to the British Navy.
He invented iron gun boats. We should never have had any ironclads
but for him. Now he has just made M.NELATON, the great French
Surgeon, a senator. This is nearly as though the QUEEN should be
pleased to confer a peerage on MR. PAGET. Now that the EMPERoR
of the FREN.h has given a surgeon the equivalent to a seat in the
House of Lords, perhaps our Admiralty, and combatant naval officers,
will begin to conceive that there may be something not unreasonable in
the condition of accepting commissions in the Navy insisted on by
educated surgeons, namely, that they shall be recognised as the equals
of gentlemen. Then will his Imperial Majesty have done our Navy
one more service by having brought about a cessation of that dearth of
medical officers which is still severely felt throughout it.

that it was presented by A. Ghote.

saddled or in harness, and I recommend any harassed or jaded person

of vexatious detractors; and so on. There were two reasons why we

The young ladies make half-a-dozen toilettes a-day. The modern
fashion of wearing full dress out-of-doors has found its way here. Too
impatient to let the sun and fresh air have fair play, the feminine leaders
of fashion have brought down the roses of RAchArl on their cheeks.
Why do ladies scream so much when enjoying the pleasures of a dip?
Are they afraid of sharks, or do they like people to come and look at
them? I never can make out. It is quite a misfortune to see so many
things in daily life that one cannot make out.
I cannot make out either what our sea-side libraries are coming to.

thus situated, and being thus situated Mr. Punch calls him a man an
a brother, will not sympathise with my sentiments regarding that
interesting creature, the young shrimp 2
You, my JUDIANA, are not drawn to the study of nature by the same
reasons. You are young and happy; but if you wish to preserve your
complexion and your spirits, without resorting to artificial means,
beware of despising the shrimp. I do not allude to the shrimp as he
appears on our breakfast table, coral red, and savoury, and where he is
equally admirable; but I allude to him as we encounter him among
myriads of his playfellows on the sea-shore.
Here we come upon a pool of them. I take out my scientific manual
and read the following extract:—
“Unfortunately many marine animals are very fond of young shrimps, and
a great amount of catching and eating goes on as soon as a fresh batch of
shrimps comes into existence.”
Now, if this is not an interesting fact, what is P Facts are so scarce
nowadays, that it is positively refreshing to be sure of anything; but
when we are told that young shrimps are so nice as to be eaten by
wholesale, we feel there is no sham in the matter.
Who can wonder at the cries of ecstasy with which young ladies
pounce upon any common object of the sea-shore ? They know well
enough how many shams there are in the world, but a jelly-fish is a
jelly-fish, and there is no mistake about it.
I wish writers of scientific manuals would not be so sentimental.
For instance, who could deliberately eat a prawn after reading the
following piece of information ?—
“The prawns when living are most exquisite beings, their partially trans-
parent bodies being diversified with delicate tintings, and their radiant eyes
glowing like living opals.”
And I must say, my daughter, that writers on Natural History make
many unaccountable omissions in describing the shore and its living
wonders. -
Here are a few species which even I, your mother, have observed in
her sea-side experiences.
The Cormorant Hotel-keeper, for instance, a very greedy bird, and
ike the cormorant in my guide, insatiable in appetite and unparalleled
in digestion... And, oh dear, what lots of crabs are left out altogether:
there is the Preaching Crab, who will put alarming little books in your
way; and there is the Official Crab, who will never give you the informa-
tion you want at the railway station; there is the Ladylike Crab, who
scolds her husband if he lets the children run into the water—and so on.
There is the large family of Snobs: Literary Snobs, Artistic Snobs,

air, an in a moment, my cynicism vanishes. Let us, for a time,

WHY LORD MAYO :
MR. DISRAELI's Governor-General for India, the successor to DAL-
HousIE, LAwRENCE, and inferior men of that sort, is an Irishman
named Bourke. He was born in 1822, and taught at Trinity College,
Dublin. He was politically known as form NAAs, was Irish Secretary
when the Tories got in, 1850, and 1858, and is Irish Secretary to MR.
DisRAELI. Nothing against him in all that Certainly not. But
MR. DisrAELI has set the people of England and of India a Conun-
drum, and it is this:– º
Why should LoRD MAyo be made the Governor-General of India,

the occupant of about the most important position in the world—a seat
on a throne not excepted P
This Conundrum baffles everybody. , Solutions have been attempted,
but they are feeble. One is, Because he is a jolly, good-natured, blun-
dering speaker, rather apt, to tumble over his own rhetorical legs.
Another is, Because he did not hinder LoRD STRATHNAIRN and the
Irish constables from putting down the Fenians. A third is Because
he is a good sportsman. A fourth is Because his name always recals
an extraordinary mºss about MR. JUSTICE KEQGH, and the singular
way Lord NAAs floundered out of it. A fifth is Because he was
Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber to LoRD, HEYTESBURY...But evi-
dently none of these answers can be the right one. _ We wait a better,

an appointment *

THE FRENCHMAN OF THE FUTURE.
FRENCHMEN fond of dancing may in the future be expected to take
malt with their hops; at least so it would º from what a Paris
correspondent tells us that he noticed at the Fête of the Fifteenth :—
“The chief articles for sale were coloured glass and gingerbread, and the
Frenchman of the old school sees with horror the ... succeeded by the
beerhouse. Paris is beginning to drink malt to an extent that will soon
change the genius of the people.”
Many people think that Frenchmen owe their levity to the light wine
which they drink, and if this, be changed for heavy brain-affecting
liquor, it is possible that their lightheartedness, as well as their light.
headedness . so to say, be ballasted by the beer which they imbibe.
Our lively neig ibours, as we call them, may in course of time be known
as our deadly-lively neighbours; and instead of being a gay city as at
present, Paris may become as dull as Birmingham or Bradford, or any
other place in England where beer-bibbers abound. No longerfrivolous,
the French may, by dint of beer, become as phlegmatic as the Germans;
and instead of their light chansons in praise of their light wine, they may
join in heavy chorusses in praise of “heavy wet.” It is possible that
ere long we may hear a Frenchman warbling a French version of the
ballad, “ For I likes a drop of good beer,” and smoking a “ Church-
warden” in lieu of cigarettes.

he goes. He says he will. He himself is like the candles, which won’t
go out unless they’re put out, or when they’re blown out, as my
Cousin stands a good chance of being if he expends much more of the
vital air upon his cornet.
If I could get him to talk me to sleep, I shouldn’t so much mind his
presence. I rouse myself and throw out a bait.
“You’ve seen a good deal of America, haven't you?”
“Been all over it,” he answers, working the pistons of his instrument
without putting it up to his mouth. He is evidently ſingering a tune,
by way of a slight preparation.
“How did you like the South P” I ask.
“Very much,” is his concise answer.
I can’t complain of his way of meeting my questions. Perhaps the
fault lies with my questions. I want to draw him out, and I want
information. He has got it in him, as they say, only the difficulty is to
get it out of him. He keeps it back in his memory garner, as if there
was going to be a dearth of information later in the year, and it would
the more valuable them.
“I heard a waltz the other day,”, he says, ruminating, and still
fingering the keys, “I can't quite catch it.”. He thinks and frowns.
“Are they musical, generally speaking, in America?” Now this
did open up a subject.
“Yes,” he answers, and continues, “this is it; ” by which he wishes
me to understand that he has found another tune. The waltz in
question.
Three-four time, it º: is a difficulty with my Cousin, who has to
keep himself strictly within bars by beating the ground with his toe; not
with his whole foot, but the toe end of the slipper only, keeping his
heel in rest, as if he were a scissor-grinder at work, or was practising
the movement for a sewing machine.
He says it is a waltz. Perhaps it was before it got into his cornet.
As he can (I find subsequently) hum the tune correctly, it is fair to
suppose that it does . in at one end of the instrument in its proper
shape; but, oh me! how does it come out at the other Do I know it
again? Can I recognise it?
Of course it must be very trying for any set of notes in a tune to
have to go down one pipe, round another, up a third, into a piston, be
knocked out of that "with such violence as to send them into the
open air, and yet to appear in the same order in which they came from
the performer's mouth after quitting his inner consciousness.
I have seen a conjuror duly load his magic gun with º wad,
bullets; and, lo, out there came, when he fired and we all (no, I mean
the ladies all; of course we didn't, we men, we smiled; and that was not
a start I gave, but I was just settling myself in my seat, or looking
for my poc º ve a little jump and a squeak, out there
came, Irecollect, flowers and bonbons.
My Cousin's was not a pleasant magic cornet. He duly loaded with
a beautiful tune–quavers, crotchets and rests all complete—and, poof
poof out there come bullets, hard, skrieking bullets, of unmusica
notes, which hit me in the ear that’s uppermost as I lie upon my bed,
and sincerely wish that there was some magic about somewhere to
whisk him and the cornet into the next county. I should call the trick
The Disappearing Boy.
This occurs to me as I lie gazing at him hopelessly, sleeplessly.
There he is stumbling about, now with one music-book, now with another,
riding his hobby not over rough ground, to which iſ have likened his
revious performance, but trotting over ground undermined by rabbits.
e tries a new country: a #.” which he has heard played, he says,
at Portsmouth by the band of the Forty-third. Splendid band the forty-
third have, he says.
He’s right there. I’ve heard 'em myself, directed by MR. CLARKE,
their leader, to whose compositions I have listened with the greatest
leasure. That band, thank heaven! does not play by ear. Imagine
or one minute a Regimental Band, consisting of performers who
layed by ear only . Think of the ophicleide, of the trombone, of the
utboy, trying their best at harmonies by ear. It makes your head
ache to dwell upon it. It would make their heads ache—including
that of MR CLARKE's, the composer—to hear my Cousin repeating
from memory the galop they played. -
... I know an imitator who takes off popular actors, and is not pleased
if you tell him how excellent is his representation of MR. Buckstone
§ always is BUCKSTONE) after he has been giving the company PHELPs.
riends suggest to him that he should name his man beforehand so as
to enhance the pleasure of his audience, and preyen; mistakes.
... My Cousin says he is going to play the “Night-bell Galop; I know
it, and he doesn’t. Who would recognise it? I don't. Would the
composer? would those who have danced to it scores of times P would
the military band whose favourite it was 2 No, not even the small
boy who turns over the leaves for the helpless hautboy could recog-
nise it. He tells you that the orchestra sing in the middle of it some-
thing about “Ha! haſ haſ fallal de rar; ” and he tells me, after
failing horribly in trying to render the effect for my benefit in bed,
that I ought to hear the Forty-third do it.
I say, “I have,” and add bitterly, “it was magnificent then; but it
doesn’t do at for one instrument alone.” Hè agrees with me, of
course, he says, and tries it again, as if that would make it better. At
last he stops, to drink, and to smoke. Now, then there must be a
respite; there is. “This shall not occur again,” I think to myself,
“You don’t come in here to-morrow night.”
He doesn't talk. He smokes dreadfully strong tobacco. In a few
moments my chamber is like a tap-room, and I get out to open the
window, and to catch a cold at the same time. When he takes his
pipe out of his mouth to puff, he hums “snatches” before resuming it,
and occasionally takes up his cornet to make two or three notes (as it
were) of a stray tune among his musical memoranda.
Suddenly (and this is a phenomenon I never observed in anybody
else except my long-lost Cousin with an Ear) his pipe falls out of his
hand, as his body goes back, and his chin drops on his breast: he is
asleep ! In a second he is asleep. No drowsiness first, no yawning, no
H. whatever. . There is something almost awful in this start-
ing collapse of all his faculties. It must be, I should imagine, a shock
to his system—it was to mine, merely to see it.
Now, I say, at all events I can turn and sleep. No, he supplants
his cornet by another instrument. He suddenly snores—not a long
wearisome heart-drawn sigh of a snore, but a sharp loud snort of
defiance—yes, it defies me to go to sleep.
I suppose I do sleep, because it is four o'clock, when, amid an unwhole-
some stench of guttering spitting candles (of course he didn’t put out the
lights before he slept; how could he and I didn't foresee the conse-
quence), I am awoke by a blast on the cornopean, with which, as
it appears to me, my Cousin has roused himself.
e asks me if I remember that sweet thing, “Good night, my Love /*
Yes, I do. “Well, then,” he asks, “how does it go 2 " I tell him
surlily, that it goes like himself, slowly, to bed. He says I must tell
him to-morrow. To-morrow, be it—good night—good night.
The torture is over at last. . It begins again three hours after at
seven, when it appears my Cousin rises to practise his cornet, “because
no one is up then,” he says, considerately.
“No,” I return, “but you seem to forget they’re in bed.”
“Then,” he retorts, “iº's time for them to get up. Besides, how
can I”—he thinks he's clenching the argument now. “How can
play to you in the evening, if I don't practise in the morning P”
This is unanswerable, at least, civilly; so I hold my tongue. If I
wander by the stream, he comes out with his cornet ſo amuseme while
I’m fishing. If I go to the farm, he follows me with his infernal in-
| strument, “to,” as he ..". says, “please the pigs.”
My invalid relative sends for in into his sanctum. They are
together for a long time. The interview ends satisfactorily to the long
lost Cousin–unsatisfactorily to me, having been quiet for nearly an hour
—as appears from his radiant face, and his immediately playing what
he thinks is “See the Conquering Hero Comes” on the lawn in front of
the house.
Hearing from him, that, as I am here, he will stop till I leave, I feign
important business, which is to take me away at once.
M. invalid relative is sorry to lose me, as he had just discovered a
new pain in his right side, which beats anything that I have ever felt.
Before I gº I say, “Ask FREDERick to play ‘Love Not’ and “The
Jast Rose’ to you.” He will. What a pleasant treat is in store for
him
Now he’ll know what a sleepless night is.
So I leave my second species of the genus, and come to The Man
without a Head on his Shoulders.
Similia Similibus.
A CRUEL young cad, of Wandsworth, has been sent to gaol, with
hard labour for a fortnight, for brutality to a poor cat. We are very
glad, but if the excellent Magistrate had ordered him another kind of
cat—a cut for each of his victim's legs, one for each of her ears, one for
her tail, and a couple for luck, to make up the supposed number of her
lives—the memoria technica would have been better.

A JOLLY WELSH POET.
ALL"that Mr. Punch has ever said about the Eisstteddfodd (he hopes
he has given all the consonants), he hereby retracts absolutely and, with
one small reservation, unconditionally. The object of the meeting was,
as explained to him, to encourage Welsh Poets. He did not think that
the encouragement had produced a very satisfactory result. But he
has changed his mind. The operation of the process of bringing the
Cambrian violets from under the leaves has º slow, but it has
been triumphant.
“Diu parturit leana catulum—sed Leonem.”
A Welsh Poet has been fostered, and he writes in English. Mr. Punch
º: to vindicate his own conversion by showing how it has been
effected.
SIR Ivor GUEST, having recently wedded, brought home his bride to
his native place, Dowlais, Rejoicings greeted the happy couple, to
whom Mr. Punch also wishes all happiness. ... But nothing could have
given the bride and bridegroom so much delight as a poem that was
addressed to them by the Rev EREND THoMAs I), MATThias, Baptist
Minister, 6, Lower Thomas Street, Merthyr Tydfil (we’ll have a
memorial slab on that house one of these days) who poured out his joy
in stanzas of which we subjoin a specimen.
“Welcome to Cambria, “ladye faire,’
And to Glamorganshire,
Where, midst our hills, the Taff and Dare
Flow down through vales of fire.
With joy the festive board we spread,
Aid deck our spacious hall,
That the worthy may be honoured
By a grand and splendid ball.”
Now we like this Baptist Minister. He does not take a fanatic
view of things, and like the Record, denounce a harmless and inspiriting
dance as a Satanic . He knows that young folks, not to say old
ones, may go through the Lancers and Sir Roger de Coverley, and
et not be .# depraved and lost, and if it had been necessary to
º: our good nature for his straightforward and simple strain, this
line would have assured it. He proceeds to say something about
Cambria's harp-changing his metre, as a facile bard can do if i. likes.
“Now that harp of mighty mem'ries—
Cambria's harp of silvery strain—
Cambria's harp that hath, for ages,
Held her peerless sovereign reign,
Hither greets the courtly chieftain,
Good Sir Ivor, to his home,
To the land of flood and mountain,
To his loved ancestral dome.”
But now we get jº. than ever, and our jovial Baptist Minister
declares that we shall make a might of it. We dare say that we have
often done so with duller fellows.
“Fill the bowl with spic'd metheglin—
Wreath a garland fresh and fair—
Sing of Ivor HAEL and ELAINE–
'Till the morn we'll banish care ;
Rose and lily, pansy, pink,
Violet, primrose, pimpernel,
From forest, field, and river's brink,
From lofty mount and lowly dell,
Cull them.” “In a chaplet.” We have not the least objection to their
being culled, but somebody else must go after them. We prefer stopping
to drink metheglin (or, if we might put a name to our own choice,
rum-and-water) with our glad bard, MR. MATTHIAs. We thought he
would not miss his little joke about GUEST, and why should he
“Cull them—a chaplet bright to weave
For our bonny bridal pair,
No honours too high to ‘a Guest' can we give—
To a bridegroom so bright—and a bride so fair.
God speed, we wish you, and length of years,
And household gifts, both rich and rare,
And the King of iº in yonder spheres
At last receive you to reign with him there."
This conclusion, put into a still longer metre, shows that the ReverEND
MR. Matthias, spite of ball and metheglin, and not going home till
morning, is mindful of his sacerdotal character. . We believe him to be
a very good fellow, and very likely he is a capital and devoted minister, |
and we hope that he has liberal deacons, who do not take the liberty of
lecturing him. We hinted at a condition. We will never say anything
more against the Eisteddfod, if it will annually turn out as jolly a poem
as MAtthias's welcome to SIR Ivolt and LADY GUEST. ſ: has never
done so yet.

HANDY-WOLUME LAW-BOOKS.
DEAR OLD PUNCH,
I AM a young man and aČ. er son, and as he has no chance
of 5..."; for me a living in the Church, my father put me in the law
to work for my own º; But though I am in the law, the law is
not in me at present; and I fancy that, unless I read, the law will go
on keeping out of me.
Now, reading is to my mind invariably a bore, and at this time of
the year, it is a bigger, bore than ever. In the first place I may say
with Falstaff, slightly altered,
“Why, 'tis my vacation, Hal; 'tis a sin for a man to labour in his vacation l’”
Besides which, what a bore it is when travelling about, as of course
one is obliged to do when everybody does so, to have to lug about a
lot of bulky law-books with one’s own luggage I declare I’m often
forced to leave my books, at home, because I cannot possibly find room
in my portmanteau for them. Moreover, if a law-book were as port-
able as Punch, not to say as pleasant also, one might often find a spare
half-hour, when one is out of town, to fly; to it. But really in one's
holidays one cannot sentence oneself daily to the hard labour of hold-
ing up a ponderous big law-book, or else of stooping to pore over it
until one's backbone feels as bent as if were a boomerang, and one
fancies that one's brains must all have sunk into one's boots. ...And
fancy what the horror of your friend's young wife would be, if she
found, a dirty dog's-eared smoky ponderous old Blackstone left among
the gilt-edged gift-books on the table in her drawing-room
I would suggest, then, that some publisher should make a speedy
future by publishing a series of Handy Volume, Lawbooks. As for
saying that tworks cannot be printed in small compass, the Handy
Wolume Shakspeare quite refutes that false assertion. The weightiest of
law works might in this manner be added to our volumes of light
literature, and might still }: to the student extremely heavy reading.
The Handy Wolume Blackstone might fitly start the series, and a dimi-
nutive edition of the Statutes at Large might be feasibly adapted to the
tourist's waistcoat pocket.
As it is, the Handy Wolume Series of plays, novels and the like, is
both for comfort and contents so tempting to a man when he is packing
for a holiday, that I for one shall certainly content myself this autumn
with reading the GoRDIAN KNot, SHENston E, Doctor JAcoB, and
HAppy Thoughts, while my BLAckstone, Broom and DANIEL, and
other bulky friends, rest quietly among the books I leave behind me.
So believe me, my bo-o-oy, yours trippingly, -

MARGATE AND THE ISLE OF THANET.
rather fancy improve
upon) the Laureate's
well-known line—
ly turns to
of Thanet.”
“Thoughts of
Thanet” we consider
- not only alliterative,
but euphonious in
the extreme. It is
not, however, until
the summer that the
thoughts blossom in-
to deeds. To the
metropolitan mind
Margate is not “in
good cut” until the
warm weather has
thoroughly set in,
until the steamer
has commenced for
the season, until the
asphalte on the jetty
has reached boiling pitch, and SIR RICHARD MAYNE in his deep desire
to add to the ... of the brute creation has issued an order for the
dogs to adopt a summer muzzlin’.
Margate is mentioned by Venerable BEDE, who says that Thanet
was really an island, being separated from the continent of East Kent
by the river Wantsume. This stream, however, took an early oppor:
tunity of drying up, and the Isle of Thanet is now no more of an island
than Salisbury Plain. The inhabitants, however, still fondly persist in
terming it one, and perhaps it is as well not to contradict them, but
#. them to indulge in their island fling. A writer of more than a
undred years back says, “The English spoken here is very good, only
the natives in common with the other inhabitants of this part of Kent,
are used to pronounce the th as d.” So wrote the author of “The
History and Antiquities of the Isle Q Tenet. but the more, modern
historian would probably write as follows, “The English spoken here
(during the season) is very bad. The visitors, in common with the
other inhabitants of certain quarters of London, are used to pronounce
the H as soft when it should be aspirated, and vice versä.”
According to a respectable authority the word Margate took its origin
from, Meregate, a small mere running through a gate there into the
sea. This, however, is mere assertion, and the popular pronunciation
of modern visitors is “Margitt,” with the accent laid well on the
“gitt.” The same rule applies to the word Ramsgate. ... But the
strangest alteration occurs in Broadstairs, which is very frequently
pronounced Dull. There are two ways of getting to the Isle of Thanet
—by rail or boat. The patronisers of the latter means of transit des-
pise the South-Eastern and Chatham and Dover Lines, whilst the
railway travellers in their turn declare the voyage to be a sure provoca-
tive of sea-sickness. This we consider to be basin sinuation. The late
boat on Saturdays is termed the “Husbands' Boat,” and those Benedicks
who can brave the satire of the assembled visitors during the walk
down the long jetty escape comparatively unscathed. But woe betide
the luckless husband who retaliates. The career of the Derby dog is a
delight compared to his quarter of a mile of misery. There is no such
behaviour at Ramsgate. There the “rowdy” element is confined to
the neighbourhood of the smaller concert rooms in the evening, where
every variety of music-hall monstrosity may be heard through the open
oughts

which the box closes, times of delivery, &c., is to read the paper in the
window. Opposite this useful, but candour compels us to
what unobtrusive building, stand
The 4." Rooms.-Here there is a concert mightly, after which
evoid of any absurd pride do not stand on forms,
but have them removed for dancing....Be it understood, too, that
dancing at Margate means dancing. What is termed “metropolitan
talent” is engaged here during the season, and until recently this
handsome room had it all its own way, but a formidable opponent
sprung into existence, a season or two ago, entitled
The Hall by the Sea.—Between these two rival establishments there
exists about the same difference as that between Tweedledum and
Tweedledee. As a gentleman in a black velvet jacket, and hounds in
full cry down his shirt front, observed to us, “The Rile is regler old-
fashioned Henglish style, whilst the Yall is more foreign like.” There
is no doubt, however, that in all matters of amusement Margate super-
sedes its more aristocratic neighbour, Ramsgate, for it also possesses a
Theatre.—This temple of the drama is somewhat awkwardly situ-
ated. We have heard several plans suggested for its speedy discovery,
of which we believe the most effectual is to stand with your back to
the ocean, walk straight on and lose yourself. The only drawback to
this proceeding is the possibility of your finding yourself, in the course
of time, in the neighbourhood of Canterbury. If you do so, you should
at once turn back. You will have saved your admission money, an
have had a nice walk. The theatre is, we believe (but cannot under-
take to assert) in Hawley Square. If you cannot find it, an appro:
riate ditty, with which to lament the fact, is “Hawley’s lost now.”
We simply throw this out, as a suggestion. Skirting the coast, the
visitor perceive those “common objects of the sea-shore,”
The Bathing-Machines.—Tradition states that, on more than one
occasion, when the rush for rooms has been excessive, these amphibious
vehicles have been let out as sleeping apartments...We would recom-
mend the idea to the attention of their owners this sultry weather.
As an article of utility, we consider the bathing-machine to be as yet in
its infancy. A convenient contrivance, which can be at once employed
as an assistant towards, immersion, a bed-room, and a family coach, is
certainly an article worth cultivating. When drawn up on the shore to
be let to bachelors on the occasions we speak of, we believe the announce-
ment on the doors ran thus: “Apartments for Shingle Gentlemen.”
Visitors should by no means think of leaving Margate without viewing
. The Pump, the Gasometer, and the Grotto.—These are all remarkable
in their way, and will well repay inspection. Parties can be made to
visit the Gasometer, by which #. individual expense incurred is ren-
dered very trifling. The Pump is a popular place for pic-nics.
Having tried several of
The Hotels, we have no hesitation in pronouncing them good, and
not unreasonable. But, there is one, peculiarity about them—they
seem incapable of providing good breakfasts. Dinners are good, teas
are good, attendance very fair, but the Isle of Thanet is decidedly bad
at breakfast. Without mentioning names, we throw this out as a
gentle hint to the hotels generally, and hope that it will not be wasted
upon their proprietors. -
THE LAW IN A SCOTCH MIST.
Scotch MEN not know how to write plain English! Nonsense! Only
see how clearly they express themselves in the hundredth clause of
their new Court of Session Act:— -
“It shall no longer be competent to direct a Brieve for the Cognition of a

managers of the concert-rooms obligingly permit, the visitors to hear
the choice ditties in the open, which is a cool and economical arrange-
ment for which one can scarcely be sufficiently grateful.
The first object of interest which catches the eye of the visitor at
Margate is
The Pier. — The charge for walking on it is a Pº Stingy
people consequently consider it an imposing edifice. A band plays
there at stated periods, and it is appropriately composed of wind instru-
ments. The pier cost a hundred º. pounds; and when it nearly
broke down for want of proper support, MR. Cobb gave it a hand, and
helped it out of low water. Kent, as all know, was ever famous for its
the Court of Session, directing him to inquire whether the Person sought to

is of lawful Age; and such Person shall be deemed insane, if he be furious or
fatuous, or labouring under such Unsoundness of Mind as to render him
incapable of º: his Affairs; and such Brieves shall be served upon the

They, who think the Scotch Reform Bill ought to have included a
clause for the reform of Scottish legal phraseology, may see from the
above how needless such a measure would have virtually been.

reconsider the step which he proposes to take in setting up a Bishop of

cautery and the knife.
I am ashamed to have to state my views on absurdities which should
long ago have been as much a thing of the clumsy past as stage coaches
and street watchmen. -
| First, on the black list of abuses stands that established insult, the
Irish Church. The fall of this dilapidated fabric is certain. Other
ecclesiastical edifices will follow.
. The House of Lords, as a legislative body, is a dangerous obstruction
lying across the path of progress. It must be removed. An hereditary

mentary Reform is only in its perambulator. Everyone who contributes
to the expenses of the State should have a share in the management of
the State. Women are entitled to the franchise, and to be eligible as
Members: whether they should be allowed to speak, as well as to vote
in the House, is a matter for serious consideration. The bailot is a cer.
|tainty. Redistribution of Seats will be one of the first exploits of a sincere
“Whom should we ask to Parliament. But a far more important redistribution must follow—
that of the soil.
... I am discontented with all our Public Departments....In the Army
there is incapacity, jobbery, º and either inability or indispo-
sition to keep step with modern times and nations. In the Navy
there is waste, extravagance, bad book-keeping, and an expensive new
gun, every year. The Church is a puzzle, and in pieces. The Ad;
ministration of the Law is cumbrous, costly, and tedious., Juries and
| Justices might be admirable inventions in the days of ALFRED and
ETHELRED : in the reign of Victor LA they should disappear. The
Game Laws are the last flash of feudalism, and cannot outlive º
more seasons and sessions. In our Universities there is bigotry an
backwardness. In our Public Schools too much cricket and too little
.# I am not attached to our Diplomatic Service, and recom-
mend all the Public Offices being carefully explored. Öur taxation
is unjust, our expenditure enormous. We compel children to go to
gaol; why should we not compel them to go to school P. The Corpora-
tion of London can hardly feast into another.century, and the next
generation will probably know the comfort of living in a clean, sweet
and ornamental metropolis, when the last vestryman has died off, and
the last statue has been taken down.
I would consign to a Dictionary of obsolete and archaic words such
terms as Articles, Church-rate, Convocation, Dean, freeman, Gold Stick,
Horse-Guards, Latin verses, Lord Mayor, religious tests, sinecure,
turnpike, Usher of the Black Rod, and Westry. Our glorious Consti-
tution, our time-honoured Institutions, a well-considered measure, a
due º to vested interests, prescriptive rights, Protestant ascend-
ency, the balance of power, the wisdom of our ancestors, and the settin
of England's sun, for ever, are all highly objectionable phrases, an
mean bigotry and cant, subterfuge and job. One pledge I will give.
Is a measure brought before the House the object of which is, to
change or abolish something that is ancient, exclusive, and costly
I ºf...; that measure. There should be no Old Style in politics.
If you want me as your Member, the seat must not cost me a shilling.
The usual election expenditure is a poll-tax I am not disposed to pay.
I shall not degrade myself or you by a bowing, hand-shaking can-
vass. On the hustings I will answer any questions you may like to put
to me, from the state of our Foreign Relations to the condition of
our London Streets. Such is my platform.

is “a Descendent of WALLACE and an Admirer of Scotland.” After

ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS.
THE advantage of possessing a head is shared, a proverb tells us, by
men and pins; a proverb, which, read syllogistically, does, in this
manner, equalise men and pins. Were it not the purpose of my present
aper to *. you with some species of the genus “Man without a
}. on his Shoulders,” I could use a considerable quantity of ink, and
Wear One º down to its stump in a dissertation upon
heads in general, trying to show the superiority of the Pin Tribe over
its supposed master, Man. Moreover, there is the Great Pin Mystery,
which would involve as much curious philosophical research as the
whence and whither of the Human Race. Moreover—but I am not
going to write the treatise here suggested, I leave it to anyone whose
vacation is longer, and whose vocation for such serious psychological
studies is more decided than my own. So to my Genus.
My friend MILLER is a Man without a Head on his Shoulders. I
didn't find this out for some time after our first introduction. I say
emphatically, ourſº introduction, because we have been introduce
several times, and it was only aſter, I think, the sirth time of asking
(doubling, you see, the number of banns for certaint 's sake) that
MILLER addressed me by name, sat next to me after dinner, and, as
we cooled ourselves with the generous. Bacchus, iced, asked me to
dine with him, at Maidenhead. It was in the summer, on a certain
day, at a certain time duly named, and so to speak, signed, sealed, and
§§ as his act and deed. - - -
He borrowed my pencil to note it down in his pocket-book, both
actions being characteristic of this species of the Headless Genus, who
always carry either a pencil or a pocket-book, and sometimes both,
only in the last case they lose both together after a couple of days, or
mislay it for months or years. If the Headless Man has a pencil, he
will borrow one of your visiting cards to make a note on the back of
it, or an old envelope, or a leaf out of your metallic clasp-book.
MILLER, for instance, is very particular in making me note down all
the particulars, and is impressive on the utility of memoranda.
I didn’t know then, as I do now, that I was talking to a Headless Man.
In consequence of this invitation I refused two or three other
very pleasant parties fixed for the same day, and trusting to MILLER's
memory being as good as my own, went down to Maidenhead. . .
I went to the Inn by the bridge. Smiling, cheerful, and inclined
to be most affable to the polite Landlord, courteously jocose with his
family at the bar in muslims, and graciously familiar with the temporary
waiters, who appear at these out-of-town retreats like the flies, in
summer only, and like them attracted by the meats.
I was dressed, like the Wicked Old Gentleman who took that satirical
walk, “in my Sunday best,” but, of course (if you insist upon pressing
the simile upon me to the end of the stanza just alluded § everything
was of sufficiently sober hue and decorous cut, without any departure
from the very latest fashion of the day.
It was evening dress in which I did honour to MILLER, and my tie
was of the purest white. A bright geranium beamed from my button-
hole, the fragrance of Jean-Maria-Farina-and-none-other-Genuine was
wafted from my pocket-handkerchief, and within me was a not un-
pleasant void, where Hope and Faith were calmly awaiting Charity.
“I have come,” I explain, “to dine.” The Landlord bows, as if all
apprehension of my ultimate object being the spoons was now entirely
cleared from his mind, I feel that the above statement, though expla-
natory is not sufficiently so for the occasion; nor does it show a desire
to repose confidence in the Landlord. So I say, “I have come to
dine with MR. MILLER.”
. The Landlord inclines his head, not a bow or a nod, but an inclina-
tion, and is evidently to be taken to mean that he has no objection to
my dining with MR. MILLER, or with anyone else for the matter of
that, so long as I do dine.
But his movement does not convey the idea to me of his possessing
any knowledge of MR. MILLER... With a view to assuring him of
the fact, and reassuring myself (for Faith is in a somewhat fainting
state from being kept so long), I observe,
“MR. MILLER has ordered dinner here.”
I am sure of it. I have it down in my pocket-book.

evidently does not want to discourage me—“Very likely, Sir: I dare

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
say tº gentleman ordered it to-day. Was it,” be asks, “in a private
room t
Upon my word I really don't know. Because, the Landlord says,
he has a list of the private rooms ordered, to which he immediately
refers, without finding any mention of MILLER.
“Perhaps he hasn’t ordered dinner, Sir, and expects you in the
coffee-room.”
Perhaps so, I admit: only it’s rather taking MILLER down a peg or
two; in fact, I don't think, if I'd known I was going to dine only in
i. coffee-room, I would have bought that geranium for my button-
ole.
Another thought, as I ascend the stairs, having been invited to
inspect the coffee-room to see if MILLER is among the visitors there: If
a man says, come and dine at Maidenhead, and omits the words “with
me,” does he mean that you are to dine yourself at your own expense
Because if so, I wouldn't have chosen Maidenhead, as it costs a heap of
money for a return-ticket, and then the trains are not convenient, and
you may catch cold from the damp carriages or the river fog, or the
motion of the train may upset you so soon after dinner (I have known
this happen to the most abstemious people who didn't remember having
taken any wine to disagree with them, or indeed hardly any wine at
all); or, finally, I would have accepted the MELviLLEs’, at Richmond,
or the first-rate dinner and company at Tom WHITTAKER's new Club
in Piccadilly, with a en behind it, rather than come down merely to
dine with MILLER alone, and—and—pay for my share of the enter-
tainment.
Another doubt crosses my mind as I slowly enter the coffee-room
door: Has MILLER thought the same thing, and given it up? Impos-
sible. Besides, perhaps he is here. If he is here, I wonder whether
he has expected to come and dine with me; so that I, have to pay
for the entire feast? I decide, that it is impossible he can have
* that; land yet, I don’t know, I did, or something very
ike it.
Let me look at it reasonably. I enter on my notes the statement as
above, and from it deduce that I am to dine at MILLER's expense.
Well: if I arrive at this conclusion, why shouldn't MILLER, who has
entered in his note-book the same memorandum, substituting my name
for his, why should not he, I ask myself, also deduce from it, that he is
ing to dine at my expense? If he has so settled, how, am. I to un-
i. him? If we’ve both arranged in our own minds to dine at one
another's expense, then who's to pay ? However, that’s a question for
a third party, the Landlord. -
In the meantime I enter and inspect the guests. I am evidently
looked upon as an intruder, and can't help thinking of some scene I
have read where the detective goes into a Thieves' Kitchen, accom-
panied by the rascaily Landlord, and having seen his man, takes him
off in custody, or not finding the vagabond in question, says, “Gentle-
men, I don't see anybody I want here. Good night.”
I stand undecidedly near the door. , Ha! isn't that MILLER there,
by the window? Hope, suggests, it; but no, it isn't. There's Fos.
BERRY, whom I know; dining with two fellows I don't know, though.
Inod, as much as to say, “’Yes, I too am coming to dine.” If FosbERRY
was alone, I’d join him; but FOSBERRY and party is another pair of
snoes.
I go a little farther into the room, and now I suddenly feel that my
object is less to see MILLER, than not to see FosBERRY and his two
friends. There they are; dining: yes, dining. Far advanced in
dinner, too. By Jove, it is past seven. There’s not a table to spare.
I should like, but for pride, to take the crumbs which fall from
FosBERRY's table : so to speak. I mean, I should like to ask humbly,
to be allowed to join his table; to get myself out of the way—to rest—to
escape those remarks, which are now—I feel them passing behind hands
placed at right angles to mouths, and delivered in undertones—goin
round the room, remarks on m º appearance. I know wi ºf
should be saying if I was one of the gay gormandisers, and saw a fellow
hovering about the tables.
I nod to FosBERRY again as I go towards the door, and his friends
look up at me as much as to say, “What the deuce are yºu nodding
at our FosBERRY for? He's giving us a dinner. Ha! hal’’
The head waiter mistrusts me. The Landlord, however interests
himself in my case. - -
“CHARLEs,” he asks of a bustling little man who attends on the
rºoms. “Didn't a party come in to No. 8, just before half-past
six --
CHARLEs thinks. “Yes.” Hope brightens ".
“Perhaps your friend is among them,” says the Landlord. Perhaps
he is—capital idea.
“I know,” says CHARLEs, “that they’re a-waitin' for one or two
parties as 'asn't come yet, afore they set down to dinner.”
Waiting for me—this is very likely: very. Because not knowing
MILLER well, he would be polite at first, and wait for me.
Should the waiter ask if any gentleman of the name of what was
my friend's name * Yes, MILLER, Sir, was there *
es—no... “Couldn’t you just look in, Sir,” asks the Landlord,
“ the door is open.”
t
there is the void, voider than ever.
+
t
The door was open. From a party of eight persons arose a buzz of
conversation. I stand on the mat and look for MILLER. It’s the
detective again, only in another scene. An elderly gourmet, turning
round towards where I am standing, says, “Bring me a glass of sherry
and bitters,” after which order he resumes his conversation. .
I look to see to whom this was addressed; there is no waiter near;
so, perhaps, with their proverbial softness and activity, he has de-
scended for the º: drink, I inspect. There is a man by the
farther window, with his back turned, talking to a man with the upper
half of his body out of window-, both of whom might be MILLER, that
is, if the first would turn round, and if the other would draw himself
in ; if the latter doesn't do this, I can, only judge by going below and
looking up. When I do go below and look up, he has, perversely gone
in, so I have to ascend to the door-mat again. -
When I do, the elderly gentleman who wanted sherry and bitters
comes to meet me, angrily, “I ordered,” says he, undoubtedly to me,
“Sherry and bitters.”
“Sir!” I return with dignity, “I am not a waiter.” .
He begged º!". humm’d and haw'd, and I descending the stairs
with hauteur have the pleasure of hearing a roar of laughter in the
room above where that old fool has returned to tell “a good thing that
has happened to him just now.”
Confound MILLER! Hope and Faith have fled from the void, and
Hang MILLER! When a fellow
asks another to dine at Maidenhead—
But stop ! can I have made a mistake in the day, or the hour, or the
lace. Not the day, that’s booked; nor the hour, booked also. . But
have not booked my place; I do not mean Maidenhead, but the
name of the Hotel where we are to dine.
I do not like to say to the Landlord that I am going to seek another
hostelrie, as I see nothing near at hand but a beer-shop.
MILLER can’t have asked me to dine with him at a beer-shop
I will ask if there is another Hotel. If there is, perhaps I’ll find
MILLER there. Hope and Faith have returned to the voi , both very
much shaken.
I take a glass of sherry and a biscuit at the bar; (they can see from
this that I have not come after the silver, having my own), and leaving
word for “MR. MILLER, if he comes,” (they don't believeme, and won't
take the trouble to ask any one if he’s MILLER or not, I’ll be sworn)
that “I’ve just gone out for a stroll,’ (it's half-past seven and more)
“and will return immediately,” I quit for a time the Hotel by the bridge.
“If,” I say to myself, walking fast, “MILLER isn't at the other
place i’ll Tº
I cannot say that I had any distinct idea of what my intentions
towards MR. MILLER were if he wasn't there. But if he was, I intended
to show him no quarter (for my being late, mind you, or for his not men-
tioning the name of the Hotel, it didn't matter which), and I made up
my mind that, if I did find him, I would dine with him, with a vengeful
appetite.
Oh! here we are at the other Hotel. A stout man in a light costume
is the Landlord.
I come very nearly to the point with a direct question;
“Do you know a gentleman of the name of Miller’”
The Landlord does. Oh yes, certainly. Gentleman from London.
Oh yes, often dines here.
This, then, “is the place,” as the song says, “stand still my steed.”
Now for the next all-important question.
A WERY BAD SHOT.
THERE is a new paper which its contributors probably call the
Broad Harrow, and it is addressed to. “The Services,” which most
people, thought were already pretty well served by certain high-class
ournals that “speak of what they do know.” However, there is room
or us all, the Arrow and the %. included. Only, until the gushing
and rather green gentlemen who write the Arrow shall have established
relations with somebody who knows something, it may be well for
“the Services” to look into other journals as well. In a special and
solemn paragraph of rebuke to the }imes and all the other papers that
had condemned the appointment of LoRD MAYo to India, the Arrow
emphatically assured the world that there never had been the least
idea of making such appointment, and that the notion had arisen from
some gossip in the }}}} Englishman. Three days later, LoRD MAYo
himself was informing Cockermouth that he was going out to India as
the Eclipse Governor.
Not to be Caught.
MR, WAIT WHITMAN, the American bard, has published, a Poem
here, in which he elegantly likens his own soul to a spider. That is his
business. We suppose he knows all about it. But British souls will
not be his flies.

HOW TO SAVE OUR INCOME-TAX.
ADMIRAL PUNCH presents his compliments to the present Board of
Admiralty, and begs to call their notice to the following remarks,
jºins in a letter sent by CAPTAIN SHERARD OSBorn to the
lmes :-
“After having given much consideration to the subject of public expendi-
ture on the Navy, I avow that there should be now little difficulty in reducing
it by the annual sum of six millions, or a sum equal, say, to our Income-Tax
of 5d. in the pound sterling, and that without impairing the real fighting
power of the State. Whether in effete admirals, unserviceable half-pay
officers of all grades, huge dockyard establishments, crazy ships, gangs of
loafers receiving pay as combatants who have sworn to themselves never again
to see blue water, and reserves which are only so in name, I maintain that
there never was a time in the history of our Navy when unsparing retrench-
ment could be more advantageously carried out, both in the interest of the
State and of our service.”
ADMIRAL PUNCH not being exempted by his virtues from liability to
Income Tax would thank his brother Admirals to give up wasting
*: which he, and hundreds like him, can, but ill afford to spare.
Let the loafers in the Navy, who now eat the bread of idleness, be sent
abºut their business with a big flea in their ears. Let the obsolete
old wooden hulks now rotting in our harbours be broken up for fire-
Wood, rather than continue to cost us thousands yearly for keeping
them afloat. Let a serviceable fleet of turret-ships be built, and no
Anore millions be wasted upon men-of-war monstrosities—big, rolling,
broadside ironclads, whence, it seems, in roughish weather not a
broadside can be fired. Let promotion depend less on patronage than
merit, and let brains not always be overcome by birth. "Let expensive
dockyard jobbery no more be winked at by extravagant and indolent
officials, who º keep their eyes open to their own advantage. Let
the Navy be no longer preyed on by the knavish. And, with a view
to these amendments, let electors recollect that they may save their In:
come-Tax, if needless waste of money be prevented in the service; and
let them, therefore, firmly refuse to vote for candidates who will not
pledge themselves to vote for thorough Admiralty reform.
THE HAIR AND A FEW FAIR FRIENDS.
WE wonder if young Gentlemen now ever ask young Ladies for alock
of their hair. One would fancy men of sense would think twice ere
they did so, after laying to their hearts such intelligence as this:—
* Long hair now costs as much as 110 f. a pound; short hair ranges between
18 f. and 35f. One of the principal dealers in human tresses occupies a house
five storeys high entirely to himself, and last year he did business to the extent
of 1,233,000 f. The capillary razzias executed among the peasantry no longer
suffice to meet the enormous demand. The hair of dead persons, cut off the
corpses in the hospitals, is a great help, but still insufficient.”
Fancy begging for a love-lock, and being probably presented with
some hair cut in a º: and purchased by pound-weight ! And
fancy women fancying that a lump of purchased hair in any way can
add to their capillary attractions !, Venus Calva, the bald W. Was
º: in old Rome, and we should not wonder much if baldness
be ere long regarded as a beauty. A man, of any sense would surely
much prefer to marry, a woman without hair, than one who wore a
chignon, transplanted from a hospital.., Instead of being attracted by
copious hirsuteness, a man will find that “beauty draws him with a
single hair;” or he at any rate will think that the fewer hairs a lady
has ". her head, the greater chance there is that she is wearing
what belongs to her by nature, not by purchase.

sorts consider this most probable, and indeed traces of the former
frequenters of the town are continually cropping up in the shape of
very * bills, which every now and then catch the eye of the casual
visitor. The author of Don Juan refers to the expense attending a
visit to Dover thus—
“Thy cliffs dear Dover! harbour and hotel,”
º certainly it used to be anything but a harbour of refuge for the
estitute.
However, thanks to a growing taste for light wines, the days of dear
ports are over, and landlords and landladies are beginning to see that
their lodgings, like guns, don't go off when the charges are too heavy,
a blow up being more frequent y the result; so that the visitor may
now seek what MATT PARIs termed the “lock and key of England”
without immediately meditating a bolt. In fact, we can safely recom-
mend Dover to the attention of the holiday seeker. It is bracing,
breezy, and briny, and possesses a remarkably strong attraction in
The Castle.—There is only one instance of an escape from this great
stronghold. This was many years ago, when it was full of prisoners,
and a serious illness broke out. Steps were afterwards taken to pre-
vent the repetition of the deed, and with every success. The Castle is
of a º ectionate disposition, and is much attached to its native
soil. This pleasing trait is evinced by its embracing thirty-five acres.
It has several watch-towers (not to be confounded with clock-towers
remember), and on the north-side may be noticed the arms of the
quondam constable, Lond GREY, of Cod-nor, who was famous for his
fondness for fish. Visitors should particularly motice
The Keep.–The summit of the Keep is four hundred and sixty feet
above the level of the sea, and it is quite worth while going in for what
is certainly a good “ spin” in º: to enjoy the view from the top.

will then see how far good jokes can be carried. The French coast is

BROADSTAIRS,
Though such a proceeding is suggestive somewhat of the “Coals to
Newcastle” adage, for there are assuredly more than sufficient flies
there already. - -
Everything at Broadstairs is on the Fº principle—small, com-
pact, and cozy. There is a little bay, a little pier, some small hotels
and under-sized shops. The inhabitants are a civil, simple, race, and
the boatmen are primitive in their notions. They have not yet arrived
at that advanced state of civilisation when it is considered only proper
to bully you into }; a boat, and f. at your illiberality, when
you get out of it. Punch has unfeigned pleasure in º; the Broad-
stairs boatman on the back, and he by no means ºgrudges him an
extra sixpence when he remembers how hard life must be to these
brown-faced blue-jacketed fellows in the long winter, when there are
no visitors, and only an occasional wreck. These latter casualties bring
them in money, and doubtless suggested the familiar phrase “h'recks
pºuniarum.” The only object of interest here is
The Goodwin Sandº–They are perfectly tame, and will allow the
visitor to approach them. They are, however, not good things to be
wrecked upon, and we should advise the hardy navigator not to try it.
The perpetual contemplation of the Goodwin Sands and nothing else,
is apt after the first month or so to render the visitor's existence a
trifle monotonous; but he must console himself with the recollection
that he is not at, “ vulgar” Margate, or “snobbish” Ramsgate, that if
he is driven well nigh to the verge of lunacy, that at least he is at a
highly “genteel” resort, and that it will be all the same a hundred
years hence. There is, however, one course always, open, to him, and
after twenty-four hours of Broadstairs we should advise him to adopt
it—he can go somewhere else. Excursions should be made to
Richborough—so called from the wealth of the inhabitants; to
Birchington (famous for its boarding-schools); to Pegwell; thus named
in consequence of the appetite its air induces; and to Dover, which
still maintains pre-eminence for its wonderful “powders.”

oint out the exact spot where the fleet in question did not do what it
intended; and if you like to drop a tear to the memory of DRAKE,
FROBISHER, How ARD and HAwkINs, there is no reason why you
should repress a national and an honourable emotion. You must not
fail to observe the famous cannon termed “Queen Elizabeth’s Pocket
Pistol,” on which was written the well-known couplet by a Covent
Garden poet— -
“Load me well and keep me clean,
And I’ll carry a ball to PADDY GREEN.”
Irreverent historians have occasionally substituted the word Calais for
the patriarch of Evans's, but our version is the correct one. The
visitor should by no means miss
... Shakspeare's Cliff, which the inhabitants, by the way,
'likely to do in the course ofſ". as it is gradually “caving in,” as
the Yankees say; but it will last many centuries yet and as this
chalky promontory stands three hundred and fifty feet above the level
of the sea, it must be always looked upon as the grandest milk walk in
the kingdom.

| Dover was always famous for its pilots, who abound here in great
numbers, in fact there are pi-lots. The first submarine telegraph-
cable was laid down from here to Cape Grisnez. According to a received
authority, it broke in consequence “ of fretting on a ridge of rocks
under the Cape.” The fretting culminated in such an attack of depres:
sion that the cable eventually sunk under it. It is generally *.
that the two opposite countries were originally united by an isthmus,
but the sea being up to its “Isthmian games,” the Continents were
by the “water parted,” DesMAREst attributing the rupture to the
violent current from the north, so that they may be said to have
divided on the current-sea question.
The Bathing is considered dangerous in consequence of the sudden

The Cinque Ports consisted of Hastings, Romney, Hythe, Dover, and
Sandwich, to which were added Rye and Winchelsea. There is a
strong family likeness between these sea-port places. Indeed we have
frequently come across a Sandwich at the railway refreshment-rooms,
and taken it for Deal. They were compelled to furnish the King
(HENRY THE THIRD) with seventy-two ships, and the Cinque Port
Fleet was something to look at.

peers, before the Vlorë Warden, or the King; were not obliged to
serve as soldiers, and in fact had rather a good time of it; but the
Municipal Corporations Reform Act has altered all that, and now

THE ENFRANCHISED WASHERWOMAN.
D's bobs this, I declare, is a
surprise now, faith and
truth,
I never no more dreamt of
than of cuttin' a new
tooth !
My name, as sure as Fate,
down in the register is
wrote,
And them as 'ort to know
says I’m entitled to a
wote.
And why the dickins
shouldn’t every 'ooman
sitch as me,
What pays her parish rates,
besides a tax upon her
.."; -
The birthright of a Brittin
be allowed for to enjoy
As if no right by birth come
but through bein’ born a
boy!
'Cause I ain't no great scol-
lard, that can’t now be
- - held no rule,
For why, the franchise is all one, for wise man and for fool,
Electors now don’t need to have no wit—a will alone—
And don’t I 'ope to let you see I’ve got one of my own |
Hand which I takes in warshin’, and a mangle which I keeps,
I reckon my opinion is, as sweeps goes, wuth a sweep’s ;
My woice as wuth an 'earing as most men's wot lives by means
Of drivin' of a donkey-cart about, and cryin' greems.
Ah, drat all plaguy ribbles that their cloven’ooves has shown,
And set their 'orns and tails agin the Halter and the Throne
I’ll show 'em what I thinks about the tintacks they pursue,
The traitors, prostrates O the nasty good-for-nothin' crew
I’ll never wote for nobody as traffics with the Pope.
He never can't, I’m sartin, as took off the tax on soap.
Which, and whoever have a mind my sufferidge for to win,
Must pledge hisself for to reduce the duty upon gin.
I’ll make him promise to purtect the property of wives
From lazy, idle, drunken sots, the burden of their lives,
From roughs as beats poor women, yah! I can’t abear sitch brutes.
That them as they should cherish stamps beneath their 'obnailed boots.
Look out for tickletoby, all you miserable sinners, .
Now women of their rightful doos is like to be the winners.
Get out, both Whigs and Tories! Let each’ooman choose her Member,
And we shall be about your House, perhaps this next December.
You’ll 'ear upon the 'ustins a woice risin from the Tub,
“Reform, not Revolugion, but an out-and-out good scrub.”
For Purity of Election we shall go with 'art and soul,
A cryin’ “Suds and Sodal” as we rushes to the poll.
The words of the Reform Act which we thinks for to come hunder,
Was meant by BEN DISRAELI; all my eye about a blunder.
A duck, he'd made his mind up for to grant our sect admission;
And honly wished to do it so as for to shun suspicion.
Which bless 'is 'art, I say, and bless the overseers likewise.
Drat the rewisin’ barristers if º our claim denies'
Agin their imperence we’ll appeal, in case they so decrees,
Suppose the Court confirms it—drat the Court of Common Pleas!

Formosa has won the St. Leger, to the satisfaction of her admirers
and backers, who were right in saying, “Beautiful for ever!”
ELECTION ADDRESSES.
III. —CHARMINGLY CANDID.
To the Electors of Closeborough.
ELECTORs,
I can Not address you as “Gentlemen,” because the majority
of you are no more jº. than you are geniuses, and I cannot
call you “worthy and independent,” because I know from Election
petitions that those of you who are LoRD LostwitHIEL's tenants will
vote as LoRD LostwitHIEL pleases, and that those of you who are not
will expect bank-notes, beer, and places for your sons, all which neces-
saries of election life, as you deem them, I caution you it is now dan-
gerous for candidates to provide and constituents to consume.
At the last election for Closeborough there were two hundred and
seventy-five voters to canvass and cajole, but as LoRD LostwitHIEL
owned most of you, I bore with your small houses, back lanes, and dirty
hands, and for three days was all smiles and suavity; but now
WEEDLEs AND WINKINs, mine and, LoRD LostwitHIEL's agents,
inform me that your number is doubled by the Republican Reform
Bill, and that I am not to walk over the course, but must lose at least
a fortnight's partridge-shooting in begging you to prefer me to
RUMFORD HALEs, the Radical brewer, who distances me by many lengths
in brains, and purse, and public-houses, and would, make you a capital
Member, but is the son of a butterman, and though aspiring not
aspirating ; whilst I was at Eton, am a member of the Jockey Club,
and LoRD LostwitHIEL's brother-in-law.
I suppose I must repeat my political Creed, although I don't believe
in it, and you won't understand it. No Election Address is considered
complete without the Irish Church—the horse with which every candi-
date declares to win. You know little and care less about disendow-
ment and dis-establishment, and would infinitely prefer the abolition of
your Local Improvement Rate, or beer a penny a pint cheaper.
As my father's Archdeaconry, and College living, and Cathedral
Precentorship, and Prebendal stall are all in England, I have no per-
sonal interest in the life of the Irish Church; but so long as LoRD
LostwitHIEL and MR. DisrAELI are of opinion that it should be
propped and shored up, I shall come up by the express from Melton
to vote for the maintenance of that venerable but costly ruin. Should,
however, the keepers of my political conscience think, that it will be
for the good of the country and themselves to pull this or any other
Church down, and so prevent the job from falling into the hands of
those grasping contractors, GLADston E and BRIGHT, I shall be just
as ready to destroy as I am now to defend; and, generally, should
my noble relative and my spirited leader consider that the prosperity
of the nation and the existence of the Ministry depend upon the
adoption of the ballot, or the abolition of the Horse-Guards, or the
destruction of our Cathedrals, or the total disregard of Primogeni-
ture, or the repudiation of the National Debt, I shall not take to kick-
ing, but be quiet in harness and obedient to the Whip.
i have never found you excited about Foreign Affairs, but remember
well how violent you became when some meddling people who called
themselves sanitary reformers suggested that the death-rate in your
agreeable little market-town might be materially lowered by better
rainage. I should not, therefore, trouble you with my views about
the left bank of the Rhine, or the increasing power of Russia in India,
or the Paraguayan War—if I had any.
I am not economical myself, as my father and my tradesmen would
allow, and having through life enjoyed a handsome allowance and un-
bounded credit, I am incompetent to sympathise with those who clamour
for a reduction of the National Expenditure. Having numerous rela-
tions of my own and my wife's in the Army and Navy, in the Church
and at the Bar, in Government Offices, in Diplomatic and Colonia
Appointments, and on the foundations of our Universities and Endowed
Schools, I would have all Public Establishments which yield pay and
F. salaries, outfits, and allowances, fees, perquisites, and pensions,
eſt up with rigid extravagance. -
The Archdeacon disliked the education of the lower orders—so do I,
in my heart. On the other hand, I have an hereditary taste for Church
Rates and Ecclesiastical Courts. -
I am sorry to announce that I shall arrive at Closeborough on Monday
next—greatly to my annoyance, having to leave a pleasant shooting
party at Lord BARMoUTH's—to commence my canvass and increase
the receipts of your public-houses, and I suppose either I or MR.
FREDERICK WEEDLEs must address you every evening from the
windows of the Saracen's Head—where, happily, the cookery is more
than respectable—and confidently declare that we are sure to win and
RUMFoED HALEs certain to lose.
I shall have the bore of writing out and learning off º heart a short
º for the Nomination Day, and I shall feel particularly obliged if
the Non-electors will abstain from throwing decayed vegetable matter
at me, as I stand on the hustings and state my views about the
Regium Donum. Your anything but obedient Servant,
RoLAND RAYMOND FREscHEVILLE.

THE worst of WALEs is, THE WILD BEASTs ARE so NUMERous AND INQUisitive.
CAB STRIKE.
Lounger's Diary, Sept. 7, 8, 9.-Awful bore, no Cabs. Thought so at
first. Found one must go to the Club. Walked there. Had a tre.
mendous appetite for dinner.
Quitº awful. They don't charge any
more, though, at a Club. Haven't felt better for an age.
Shall always
walk.
Spend generally about five shillings a day in Cabs. That’s £1.15s.
a year—no, I mean a week. That’s about £87 a year. Always won-
dered where the money went to. Now I know. Keep it for very wet
weather. Hang the Cabs |
Government Clerk's Note.—No Cabs. Don't like to be seen outside a
'bus. Go inside. Met several other fellows all there for the same
reason. Got to the office as soon as usual. Try the knife-board
to-morrow morning.
8th–Have tried. Very pleasant. Wish they’d stop quite still
while one gets up and down. Nasty knack they have of going on
before you’re seated. Soon get accustomed to this. And what a
saving !
By an Invalid.—No Cabs. Oh, dear—so ill! Must go and see my
doctor. I generally go to him, for a consultation, in a Cab. Saves his
coming to me. S'pose I must walk, but I never do walk. Besides,
where is there one can walk in London? Can't send the servant—the
other lodgers want her.
Nert day.—Odd it is I have walked. When I got to the doctor's
door I felt so well that I was sure a guinea would be wasted, and pre-
scriptions would be throwing money away.
All I wanted was a walk—a good, rattling, blood-circulating walk.
And as to fresh air, I don't know when I’ve enjoyed anything more
than ºf Kensington Gardens and the Park to get down to Saville
Row, Shall do it regularly. I am very much obliged to the Cabs for
striking.
Little Wife.—FRED took me out for a walk to-day, and we walked to
the theatre, together. , FREn said he enjoyed it immensely. So did I,
I’m sure; because I don’t like going to the theatre generally with him,
it is such an expense (he says, and so it is) on my account. We must
have a Cab there and back. But as there were no Cabs, it was a capi-
excuse, if any one met us not in evening dress; and FREd is so
particular–on my account. I wish there were no more Cabs ever again,
until we can afford it; and then, perhaps, we’ll have our own carriage.
An Old Stager.—Wonderful! The first three days in my life I’ve
ever passed, consecutively, without a row with a cabman. Don't miss
them a bit. Mere matter of habit. I find (I didn't know this before,
cabbing having become a routine with me) that I can go everywhere

rallway.

Sir. Plenty of air and exercise. If you want a stroll, try the Embank.
ment., Who wants a vacation?...I do; and if I only save up the money
I used to spend in Cabs, I shall have a first-rate trip for next year.
That’s my moral out of the recent Cab Strike.
HIS HOLIDAY TASK.
LoRD MAYo is spending his vacation in strict seclusion, educating
himself for the Indian Viceroyalty. He has nearly finished Macaulay's
... Clive and Warren Hastings, and will shortly commence reading
an abridgment of Mill’s History of British India. #. Lordship takes
lessons, every day in the º of the extensive Empire he is
about, by the kind permission of MR. DisBAELI, to govern, and can
already find the three Presidencies on the Globe: he is also, with the
help of a Memoria Technica, making himself acquainted with the lead-
ing events of Indian history. At the dinner-table the conversation
chiefly turns on the Works of Sir William Jones, and the baneful effects
of Caste, and, the younger members of the family are allowed to speak
nothing but Tamil in the school-room, and out walking. The Viceroy
Elect's constituents at Cockermouth are subscribing to present him
with a Hindustani Grammar and Vocabulary.

MoAN, HEARD on A RAMSGATE BOAT.
“Why DIDN'T we Go BY RAIL?”
123
NO ADO ABOUT ANYTHING.
WHEN, the deputation from the Cabmen who struck
against the public, to put pressure through it on the rail-
way directors, waited on SiR RICHARD MAYNE at Scotland
Yard, and suggested to him that he had the power of
asked by our active and efficient Chief Commissioner of
Police the following remarkable question :-
“How could the Association expect him to put a law into
force against the railway authorities when he had abstained from
putting it into force against the Association, for not sending
their cabs for hire in the proper way?”
This beats SHAKSPEARE. The doctrine of constabulary
non-intervention is not better illustrated in Much Ado
RICHARD MAYNE’s way of dealing with emergencies
affecting the public, particularly when he knows that an
Act of Parliament has been driven through. Having
owned that he had abstained from enforcing the law
against persons who had acted illegally, he went on to tell
those same persons that he very much applauded what they
had done:—
“There was, however, one thing which gave him great satis-
faction. On all sides he had heard it stated that the conduct of
the men on strike had been admirable and satisfactory. He
trusted this would continue, and that they would on no account
tlisturb the public peace. He felt pleasure in saying thus much,
because it reflected great credit on the men.”
Law-breakers º credit from SIR RICHARD MAYNE for
having been so kind and forbearing as to refrain from
aggravating the breach of law by violence, and injury to
person or property. Perhaps he will next praise a pick-
pocket because he was not a #. SIR. RICHARD is

him with the Cross of the Legion of Honour.

A BUZZ BY A TRUE BLUEBOTTLE.
(In the Ear of ARCHBIs HoP TRENCH.)
I still remain a Protestant, I’m not ashamed to say,
And “No Surrender” is my cry; or, if you like, my bray.
While yet the Pope’s a Power abroad, the Pope’s a foe at home;
And I shall cry “No Popery’ until the French quit Rome.
I doubt, though, of the Irish Church, and if you let it go,
Whether you’ll yield a bulwark to the enemy or no, , , ,
Whether indeed he do not, while against him you maintain
The Syllabus in spirit, the advantage rather gain.
But O mine Irish Bishop, O my Parson, O my Friend!
Beware with what munitions you your citadel defend.
Raise mounds, plant stakes, and with chevaux de frise your ramparts
crown, - -
But don't you set up skittles to be instantly bowled down.
O reverend rhetoricians, can you possibly suppose
Because you call a Church “Her,” that your Church has eyes and
nose, -
And is a living Person, as that word’s by MILL applied,
With rights, as such, of property, that must intact abide?
Your Church is an Abstraction, without either crown or sole,
Can neither wear chaussure on foot, nor chignon upon poll;
Your vested rights are all the rights whereof she stands possessed:
Whilst your life-property is spared, the State can claim the rest.
Then take your loaves and fishes, and enjoy your several shares,
No Corporation has a right of leaving wealth to heirs; .
Save only what the nation grants, which if you’d have it do,
Show your successors like to be more worth their salt than you.
THE STAFF of LIFE.-A French Bread Bludgeon.
SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BEST.
THE Indépendance Belge the other day published a statement that
the PRINCE IMPERIAL had lately said, “When I shall be Emperor I
shall not allow any one to be without religion.” To this has been
given an official denial, thus concluding:—
“These words were never made use of by the PRINCE IMPERIAL, who, at
his present age, would not think of interfering with political matters.”
No. Not with matters simply political. But might he not possibly
think of interfering with politico-religious matters ? Perhaps the priests,
by whom he is partly brought up, have forgotten to teach him not
to think of any such thing. Such a speech as that which little NAP is
reported to have made, any child, might have naturally made under
eculiar circumstances. Born with an organisation partly Spanish, a
oy would very likely feel predisposed to acts of faith. Even if he did
not say that he would perform them one of these days, he might be ex-
ected to think he would. , France may, nevertheless, hope that when
AstER Louis comes to be a man he will, think better of it, so that,
notwithstanding the Syllabus, he may have been taught to think by at
first, his second thought will be toleration.
A Cosmopolitan Idea.
THE Extradition Committee have just published their Report. They
recommend that, on stipulated sº. the extradition of criminals
should be facilitated. It is well that we and foreigners should agree to
give up each other's rogues, but how much better it would be if we
could also get our foreign friends to give up their rogueries :

GOOD WOMEN AND GOOD WORK.
LIKE every other gentleman, Mr. Punch is always happy
when he can help a lady, and he doubts not but that many
other gentlemen will thank him for informing them how
they may go and do so. Well, then, let them call a hansom,
and drive forthwith to 8, Pont Street, near to Belgrave
Square, and ask to see Miss GRIFFITHs, the Secretary of
the Ladies' Sanitary Association, whose offices are there.
This lady is at present very much in need of help, not for
herself, please mind, but for the poor people for whom she
yearly pleads. Pull out your purses therefore, Gentlemen
and ſº p her to assist them, and be fººl to your Pune
for telling you how you may aid a lady to help those who
sadly need your aid. -
§. in London merely, but throughout the kingdom,
these sanitary ladies are doing much good work. They
wage fierce war with dirt, as tending to disease, andº
ood advice on cleanliness as helping to good health
K. substantial than advice, a gift of soap and brushes is
often added to it, and a coat or two of whitewash accom-
panies the present, and makes a filthy ceiling a thing
purely of the past. ... But food as well as cleanliness is
#. to good health, and so these sanitary ladies serve
out soup as well as soap. Last year, in Chelsea only, they
gave well nigh five thousand dinners to poor half-starving
children, and next year they will be happy to give fifty
thousand more, if they can only get the funds to pay the
bill of fare. Besides these ragged, dinner-parties º
have also ragged park-parties, and give a breath of fres
tº: to some forty thousand pent-up and half-stifled
ittle lungs.
So, ye Gentlemen of England, who go yachting on the
seas, or are otherwise enjoying }. vacation and your
ease, assist these useful sanitary ladies, if you please, and
send them many sovereigns, or, better still, guin-eas.
Annexation of Useful Knowledge.
At Guildhall, the other day, one HENRY R. HERBERT, a
porter, was brought before ALDERMAN HALE, charged
with stealing from the shop of MEssRs. HAMILTON & Co.,
of Paternoster Row, two books, value 58s. Former con-
victions were proved against the prisoner. The books
which he was accused of having stolen were “two volumes
of a magisterial synopsis.”. A useful work, one woul
think, for a gentleman liable to be often brought by his
vocation into contact with the Bench.
ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS.
(Continued.)
THE next question was,
“Is MR. MILLER here?”
“No, Sir, he is not,” the Landlord answers; “and, I don't think
he will be; for 'tain’t often as he dines two days together here in the
season.”
Two days together! Oh, then he came—that is he dined here—
“Yesterday. Sir. Yes: don’t 'spect him to-day. No, Sir. Are you
waiting for any one, Sir P”
Yes, for a Headless Man, who was here . Knowing more
of him after this (when I am bound to say he amply made up É. his
headlessness on this occasion; but even then it was only by mysticking
close to him), I found that though he entered all his engagements most
scrupulously in a book, he was sure to mislay or entirely ose it.
The Headless Man is an admirable systematiser. To hear him arrange
the hours of his day, or of his week, and to see it all on paper impresses
you immensely: at first.
I stayed at MILLER's house in the country. If MILLER had invited
me by letter, and given me to understand that he expected me on such
and such a day, I should have gone, and in all probability he would
either have got his house full, or been absent from home; but, luckily,
meeting me in Town, he said, “Pack up, and come, along.” So the
day being lovely, and the prospect agreeable, I packed up and came
along.
The first thing to strike me was his utter ignorance of the railway
arrangements on his own line, by which he must have travelled hun-
dreds of times, as well as of his own locality, when he got there.
“I don’t know exactly,” he says, “when the train starts. I’ve got
a card somewhere.” #e he rummages all his pockets, one after the
i. makes a discovery which entirely changes the current of his
oughts.
“By Jovel” says he, “I’ve lost my handkerchief!”
Could he have left it in his great coat.” No, he hadn't had his great
coat on that morning, at least he thinks not. Yet, on consideration,
didn’t he, he asks me, put it on to come to Town in?
“How can I know P” I ask him. He pauses over this poser, and
answers himself to the effect that if he did put it on it must be at the
Railway Station at Blatchford. “Talking of Blatchford,” he suddenly
exclaims, “I wonder where the deuce I #. my ticket,” Here
follows another rummage which ends in the discovery of a hole in the
lining of his right-hand, coat, pocket, through which no doubt, the
ticket would have slipped easily, only that (after ºf the hole to
the size of his fist and finding {i, latch-key, which he inflost months
ago) it occurs to him that he hadn’t taken a return ticket that morning,
and so, of course, couldn't have lost it.
... I think,” says he—he never gets beyond the expression of a proba-
bility—“that there’s a train at two-thirty.” He appeals to me for the
time, as he finds that he had forgotten to wind up his watch last night.
This reminds him (before I can tell him what he wants to know) that
he has to call and get a new watch-key. Will I come * or shall he go
and then return for me. No, I will accompany him. , I know well
enough if he is once out of my sight, farewell to my chance of going
down to Blatchford with any likelihood of seeing him there.
Off we start together. The sight of a stationer's shop causes him to
stop abruptly. , Isn't he well ? No, he only wishes, me to be quiet
one moment while, he thinks. Another rummage in his pockets. An
tººl to me : didn't I see him take out his pocket-book just now *
I did. “In your room.” Yes. “Then,” he returns positively, “I
must have left it there.”
This, however, is no reason why he shouldn't buy another. “You
can’t,” he argues, “have too many memorandum books—always
useful.” We enter the shop : he addresses the man at the counter.

A PIECE OF LOCAL PATHOS.
HERE is a good six-penny-
worth from the Surrey
Advertiser and County
Times. It is very nearly
seven lines, each one
of them cheap at its
cost price. The lad to
whom it refers was an
orphan, aged fourteen,
employed in hop-pick-
ing, and his history,
which “our informant,
a lady,” says the pro-
vincial ournalist,
“elicited from the
boy,” is too sad for
these pages. Suffice it
to mention that he
was the son of a
butcher, and that,
having been thrown,
friendless, upon his
own resources, “the
youthful hop-picker,
cladinbutcher's smock,
was then left to fighthis
way in the world.” Our
journalist proceeds:–
“As the poor boy unfolded his tale of woe, bitter tears rolled rapidly down his sunburnt
theeks, and, later in the day, tears of gratitude bespoke his thankfulness for the assis-
tance rendered by the lady, who on leaving his “frame’ placed a shilling in his hand.
The gratuity was accompanied by words of counsel, which the youth promised to remember
in his season of trial.”
There will be recognised, in the foregoing, a quite peculiar combination of airiness
find pathos, sobered with a grave tint or serious shade, and set off with a touch of
humour. How manifest is the latter in the idea of the youthful hop-picker, clad
in butcher's smock,” and the former in the statement that “the gratuity,” ordi.
marily called present, and vulgarly tip “was accompanied by words of counsel,”
that is to say, religious advice, “which the youth promised to remember in his
season of trial,” or, in common language, whenever he was in trouble! By the
Yºy, trial and trouble are too often convertible terms, especially when trial is
followed by conviction, and conviction by imprisonment ºf hard labour, which
words of counsel (in wig and gown), have failed to avert.
Had our journalist been contented with saying that the boy cried bitterly, he
would have eyinced a want of that vivacity of sentiment which bespeaks itself in
the more flowing relation that “bitter tears rolled down his sunburnt checks."
The epithets “bitter” and “sunburnt” applied to the
cheeks and the tears, and the representation of the latter
as rolling down the former, constitute the boy “clad in
butcher's smock” a picturesque and interesting object,
somewhat more than a mere object of simple prosaic com-
passion. In this point of view we feel his effectiveness much
enhanced by the further information, that again, “later in
the day, tears of gratitude, bespoke his thankfulness for
the assistance rendered by the lady.”
The assistance amounted to the not very enormous
šum, of one shilling, which she gave the boy, or, as our
local contemporary more graphically puts it, “placed in
his hand.” For this relief much thanks were doubtless
received, but its vastness was perhaps not so overpower-
'i. to make the recipient absolutely cry with gratitude,
A little embellishment, however, is allowable in the poetical
paragraph. The plain fact, probably, was that the boy, when
the lady gave him the shilling, just said, “Thank yer,
Mºm,”, and, then went and told his companions that “a
jolly old gal had, forked him out a bob; ” but if plain fact
only were usually reported in the country papers, their
habitual subscribers would miss the accustomed, gratifi-
cation derived from those affecting narratives by which their
occasional readers are amused.
Donkey Race at Doncaster.
AT Doncaster Races, among the quadrupeds that ran
for the Badminton Handicap one was named Ritualist.
The owner of this beast was a MR. PRIoR. Supposing
that the Doncaster Races are horse races, some people
may wonder that a Prior should have given the name
of Ritualist to a noble animal. A regular Prior would of
course never have done any such thing, and we are driven
to the supposition that the Badminton Handicap is a race
in which the winner comes in hindmost.

PENANCE FOR THE FRENCH PRESS.
Owing to a printers' strike, the journals of Marseilles
were reduced the other day to º nothing but blank
sheets. What a prºlº to be followed by the rest of
|. French press] Considering how very little news or
| useful information they are suffered to impart, it would be
|surely all the better if French newspapers in ſº Were
ninety-nine days in a hundred, to . en blanc, instead
of coming out in their now usual black and white. Faute
| de news, their corners not uncommonly are filled with
| such indecencies as certainly no English editor would
suffer to appear. These would clearly be º: by
the course which, the Marseilles journals have recently
| pursued. For their º: in this way, the majority
of Paris papers should do penance once a week, to say
the least, in a white sheet. Really a French journal
would be readable throughout, if there were nothing, to
be read in it excepting just the title and the date of public
cation. Gagged as their Press is, our “lively neighbours”
now-a-days produce the dullest newspapers; and to make
their journals fit to lie on English tables, nine in ten of
them at least should be issued in blank sheets.
A NEED IN THE NURSERY.
WANTED by the generality of ladies, being mothers of families, and
ranking amongst the richer classes, a nursery, directress, who would
undertake the supervision of the baby, or babies it may be, to see
that their tiny clothing be well aired, kept in repair, even replenished
º the help of º: to arrange that they have their proper hours
of rest, airing, suitable amusements to, prevent fretful weariness—in
short, to perform all the duties actually above a low menial's work.”
he words above quoted are taken from a letter in the Times signed
. MARY HEATH, Lady Superintendent, Home and Foreign Governesses'
Institution, iſ8, Brompton Road.” This lady says that there are
hundreds of women, who, “ º hardly fitted for teaching,” “would
§: be treasures in the house” if engaged to attend to the needs of
bies, such as she specifies. “With such a person,” she observes
“ the mother might depend on having in the nursery one who would
not, as is too often, the case, be giving mere eye-service, and whose
own superior position would be sufficient, security to her employers,
that in their absence there would be no lengthy flirtations with the
butler or coachman, no lounging for hours in the kitchen to the neglect
and often pain of the poor little helpless ones in the nursery above.”
The nursery directress, in short, is wanted in the place of a parent, and
in the stead of a servant-gal. Mothers who have duties to do in the
drawing-room cannot perform them in the nursery, and the question is
whether, in their absence, their children shall have the benefit of
“lady-like manners and gentle firmness” on the part of their attendant,
or be at the mercy of “vulgar coarseness and want of judgment in an
3.x
resent in the great majority of instances. And it is not a case of
#. choice.
What is the difficulty that can possibly deter children from being
ruled and guided with ladylike manners and gentle firmness? Finan-
cial? Not so. “A home and small salary,” we are told, would be a
consideration sufficient to secure those advantages. The one thin
needful is not pecuniary. “The position of nursery-directress, woul
be a boon” to the numerous ladies qualified to take it, “could the
but accept, such without lowering themselves as ladies.” That is all.
“This could be arranged by mothers placing such a member of their
household in so relative a position to themselves that none of good
birth and gentle breeding need hesitate to accept.” There is nothing
to prevent this on the part of mothers but that stuckupishness in
which there is really as much vulgar coarseness and want o jº
as any that the commonest nursemaid exhibits in her way. It is,
indeed, as much servantgalism in a mistress, as the corresponding dis-
osition in a master is flunkeyism. Courtesy costs nothing; and it is
or ladies to consider whether that is too great a price to pay for a
nursery-directress. If they will not choose to afford it, they must be
content to leave their children in the hands of a sort of person who is
called a bonne, but would more correctly be termed a mauvaise.
Queer Taste.

Perhaps a mystical significance was intended by the Roman
Legitimists in the number of the which they presented
to the occupant of the Apostolic See. The Pope will,
possibly, evince his recognition of it by calling his twelve
new rifled cannon the Twelve Apostles.

DOGBERRY AND THE DOGS.
- R. PUNCH,-A policeman ap-
peared as a witness the other
day before one of the *:::::::
trates, covered, as to both his
hands, with black scars, the
marks of dog-bites, caute-
rised. He had received these
injuries in carrying out the
orders of Sir Richard
MAYNE to “comprehend all
vagrom’ dogs, unmuzzled.
R. Holmes Coote, the
eminent surgeon, writes to
the Times, and says that,
during... an experience of
above thirty years at St. Bar-
tholomew’s, he has only seen
two cases of hydrophobia.
It is, he adds, everywhere,
a very uncommon disease.
There is no class of public
servants more valuable than
the police. They are worth
quite as much as soldiers
to say the least; as useful
at all times as soldiers are in
war-time. In fact, they are
soldiers who fight our daily
battles with our native black-
guards. Now that, the hand
which was intended to grasp
the collar of a garotter, or
enforce the advancement of
the populace with the ashen
-
staff, should be liable to be
.5 disabled from performing
those inestimable services
- by the fangs of curs, is a
thing “most tolerable and not to be endured.” If hydrophobia were really likely
to be contracted from dog-bites, we should tremble for the safety of ourº
tors, and that of our own persons and property, which depends upon the efficiency
of their hands. No less than as many as 12,000 dogs have been apprehended by
the police. How many of the gallant fellows must have been bitten Under these
circumstances, MR. Coote's statement of the infrequency of hydrophobia is
reassuring.
Thus much, however, we know, that, so long as policemen are employed in
taking up dogs, they will, very many of them, bitten at any rate. That is
certain; whereas we are not sure that anybody would be bitten if the dogs were
left alone. The only effect which SIR. Rich ARD MAYNE's ukase can possibly have
is, that a certain number of policemen must necessarily be bitten, and so many
must consequently incur whatever chance there is of hydrophobia.
With a view, therefore, to the prevention of hydrophobia, as well as to the pro-
tection of the public from thieves and ruffians, SIR. Richard MAYNE will, perhaps,
be pleased to recognise, if he can recognise anything, the expediency of ſº
the police to let dogs be, and devote their attention rather to interfering with street
robberies. Believeme
No MAIN-IAC.
NEW NAMES FOR THE NAVY.
It seems generally admitted that the monstrous ships which lately have been
added to the Navy are by no means worth the monstrous sums of money we have
paid for them. Qur big men-of-war in armour, which cost half-a-million each, are
said to be as useless and unhandy in a sea-way as the obsolete old men-in-armour
who adorn a Lord Mayor's Show. Yet still we go on building them, and naming
them the Hercules, the Irresistible, and so forth; as if the use of strong words
for their christening would suffice to prove their strength. Would it not be wiser
to call a spade a spade, and to name our naval failures in a way that at a glance
should designate their worth P When we launch, the broadside iron-clads which
now are in construction, instead of calling them by names such as the Powerful,
the Valiant, the Dauntless, or the Thunderer, let us christen them the Wasteful, the
Ertraragant, the Useless, or the Blunderer. There, is small doubt that the Navy
will be always dear to England; but that, pecuniarily speaking, it is dearer than it
ought to be, the doubt is smaller still. Names such as we suggest might possibly
awaken public notice to this fact, and by calling ships the Costly, the Gander, or the
Jackass, we should identify them faithfully with blundering authorities, who sanction
their construction, and leave us to pay their cost.

ONDON CHARIVARI. 133
PUNCH, OR THE L
PUNCH'S HANDBOOK FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
BRIGHTON.
T- RIGHTELMStone was ori-
ginally a fishing village,
and inhabited by fisher-
men, who were termed
ſ Jugs. These Jugs were
getting on very comfort-
ably, when some Flemish
folk cast a longing eye
at the natural advan-
tages held out to follow-
ers of the gentle craft
and they came over and
attempted to share...in
the silver plunder. The
Jugs, however, soon
found they couldn’t get
on very well with these
Flanders bricks, and got
very much broken up,
as must inevitably be the case with crockery under such circumstances.
French vessels, too, were continually hovering around, and trying to
trade with the Brightelmstone natives, who, however, invariably re-
jected French-ship's offering. The sea, too, in the seventeenth century
!. n to make itself exceedingly unpleasant, and used, to appear at
awkward hours in the bedrooms of the inhabitants, which was hard
lines for the Jugs, whom it would not perhaps be out of place to term
Brightelmstony-'uns. -
By the advice, however, of DR., Russell, the fashionable world
commenced visiting the quondam fishing village for bathing, and one
lucky day for Brighton the PRINCE of WALES determined to settle
there, and commenced the Pavilion, which in 1817 was very much
altered, and eventually converted into that magnificent architectural
nightmare which looks very like what, a gigantic Vauxhall Firework
Temple would do afterº: the best years of its life in Wardour
Street. The Pier was built, houses covered the downs (and the ups),
and the railway direct to Iondon ensures an inexhaustible supply of
newspapers, fruit, fish, flowers, poultry and stockbrokers.
The Pavilion claims (and indeed secures) notice from the fact of its
being the very ugliest building in the world. The contemptible mean-
ness of the pepper-boxes in Trafalgar Square, the determined hideous-
ness of King's Cross Railway Station, the sullen º of Newgate,
all pale their ineffectual, frightfulness before the Brighton Pavilion.
NAsh was supposed to be the architect (he should have built the
Nash-ional Gallery too), but the real conceiver of the edifice was a
Royal Prince. Architecture might have been his weakness, it certainly
was not his strength.
The Chain Pier should not be missed by the visitor, as it would
inevitably result in an immersion. This, with the West Pier and the
Esp e monopolises the fashionable promenaders of Brighton, not
forgetting, however,
Kemp Town, built by THOMAS KEMP, concerning whom the absurd
story that his relations, proud of their family name and his achieve-
ment, exclaimed, “THoMAs a KEMP is,” may be considered a fiction.
It contains a magnificent square and crescent, to say nothing of a
tunnel leading to a private esplanade. , Behind it stands the Sussex
County Hospital and St. Mary’s Hall, where clergymen's orphan
daughters are brought up, economically as governesses, poor dears,
and Brighton College, which, having a back and front entrance, estab-
lishes its claim to be considered a good specimen of Two-door architec-
ture. The visitor should patronise the British Drama at the Theatre,
drink every variety of mineral water at the Royal German Spa, walk
himself out of breath on the Downs, and by no means fail to take a
bath at BRILL's and a bun at MUTTON's.
HASTINGS AND ST. LEONARDS.
That this delightful town takes its name from HASTEN (who even-
tually found what he was looking for we trust, the early chroniclers
declaring he was always a sea-king) is proved to have been a mistake.
The in marks it as an early Saxon settlement. Early Saxon settle-
ments, by the way, we hear the tradesmen of the period found exceed-
ingly rare. The word takes its rise from the Haestingas. Their descendants,
in the shape of Male Mosquitoes, have visited the coast this summer.
It had at the time of the Confessor many ships and sailors—the latter
being appropriately termed but-se-Karls. The town sunk to a mere
fishing }. however, in the course of years, but DR. BAILLIE (what
do the inhabitants, to say nothing of the patients, owe these doctors')
recommended it to invalids, who came in such quantities that MR.
BURTON, the architect, and his son DECIMUs, commenced another
town, and now two miles of terrace stretch out to the London and
|Brighton Railway Station, and will eventually, no doubt, catch the
train. From the East Cliff the visitor can see the old town “at a
glance,” and on a fine day he can descry Picardy; if, however, it isn't
clear weather, it isn't clear whether it is the coast of France or not, but
tradition states that in the summer of 1797, by a curious atmospherical
phenomenon, the people on the opposite coasts could almost distin-
guish each other, though one short-sighted Irishman declared he found
it “by no means hazy.” A strong sea-wall once ran from Castle Hill
to East Cliff, but the effort was too much for it, and it completely
broke down.
There is an interesting remnant of the old Castle to be seen, and—
well, that’s about all. To speak the truth, Hastings and St. Léonards
are in themselves dreadfully dull. LoRD BYRON found it dull here
CAMPBELL found it dull, CHARLEs LAMB found it very dull, and longe
for smugglers. The only person, in fact, who ever found it lively was
WILLIAM THE ConquERoR.
º though the town itself is uninteresting, we can highly recom-
Inell
The Neighbourhood, which is rich in rare spots of beauty. A ramble
to Ecclesbourne, returning by the shore when the sea is out, may be
considered a very tidey walk, whilst Fairlight Glen and the Lover's
Seat present peculiar attractions—the latter especially to any one who
is tired. The legend states that the Captain of a revenue-cutter selected
this somewhat exposed, and certainly slightly uncomfortable position,
for stolen interviews with his ladye love, the only person to whom he
cared to pay his duty. It was certainly a dangerous choice, as in the
event of the Sussex maiden feeling disposed to throw him over, the
llant Captain could never have recovered himself. Near here is a
amous waterfall, called Old Roar. This, however, is perhaps the dryest
waterfall out, in consequence of the continual absence of the roar
material in the shape of water. In fact, so silent is this venerable
ºlº, that it may be said to suggest far less the liquid than the
mule.
TERMINUS MORALS,
Scene—A Railway Terminus, MR. and MRs. WRANGELtop have re-
turned, tired and cross, after a long tour, and desire nothing so much
as getting home, and losing the sound of each other's tongue. But
all the Cabs are gone.
Mrs. Wrangeltop. Of course you have let the last cab go. You are
as helpless as a child.
Mr. W.£arºltop. My fault, of course.

r. W. And so have to sit upon a box. Ha, ha! You had better
have sat upon the principle, and got to Brompton in good time.
Mrs. W. Wretched joking ! #. it is easier to make bad jokes at
your wife than to exert yourself like a man for her comfort. I recollect
when we came up with oR BouncE, we had no such trouble. He
commanded a cab, and was instantly obeyed. No porter dared slink
away from him. -
| Mr. W. He is a great man, no doubt.
Mrs. W. He is the sort of man a woman likes when she is in need.
He does not fawn on a servant, and beg him, if he pleases, to get a
cab, but orders him to do his duty.
Mr. W. With a wink of his eye, and a shilling between his fingers.
Mrs. W. I don’t believe it. AJOR Bounce knows how to get on
in the world. Are we to sit here all night?
Mr. W. (doggedly). The*. say we shall get no more cabs.
Mrs. B. Then I shall walk to Brompton, and you may see to the
lussº; at your leisure.
[Malks. So soon as she turns her back, MR.W. speaks in his own way
to a porter, and that intelligent being suddenly sees a Cab
going by. In a few minutes they are riding home as comfortably
as is consistent with a renewal of the quarrel. . The moral is—
Tºp the porter, and don't let your wife see you do it.

ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS.
(Continued.)
We arrive at Blatchford—the Headless Man and I.
That he has lost his ticket cela va sans dire: that, while looking for
his purse, to pay his fare over again, he finds it, is also a matter of
course.
A season-ticket is too t a responsibility for a Headless Man. He
tells me that the possession of one of these billets had gone near to
bring on a violent fever. -
“Sometimes,” says he, “they ask for it, sometimes they don't... If
they don’t, you are afraid they are going to, and you search for it in
every pocket, you prepare an explanation to account for its loss, but
the Guard appears, and knowing you, says, “All right, Sir, and
passes on, when you, have the satisfaction of explaining to a fellow-
traveller, that it was lucky he didn't ask to see it, as you hadn’t got
it "if there comes an official who knows not Joseph, then Joseph
has to show his ticket, and if he can't, he has to accompany the Guard
(which looks as if you’d been picking pockets in the carriage, or card-
sharping) to the Inspector's office, and then you have to take your
oath, and sign a paper, and write to a secretary, and promise you’ll
never do it again, and be good in future on pain of various penalties
when you are dismissed., Perhaps, on your return home you can't fin
the season-ticket after all your affidavits, or you do find it, and forget
to put it in your pocket on the very next day, when the same cere:
monies will take place, unless a gratuity for secret service is bestowed
upon the Guard; but this, if repeated often, when added to the original
cost of your season-ticket comes to a considerable sum in the end, not
that I ever did add it ". says my Headless Man, who I find is not
happy at figures, though he prides himself upon, being most exact and
correct in his accounts when he keeps them, “but of course it would
mount up, you know.”
MILLER (odd that his name should be Joseph, as may be seen from
the foregoing paragraph) tells me this at the station while the porter
is getting our luggage.
I ask him how far it is to his house.
“By Jove!” exclaims the Headless Man, smacking his hands
* sharply. -
.The º strikes me that his house is full and no bed for me, or
his wife is ill, or no one at home, or the painters and plumbers there,
or any other little pleasantry which
“What is it P” # ask, anxiously.
“I’ve forgotten,” he says, “to tell the trap to come for us.”
“Is that all?”. I return. “We can walk, and send for the luggage.”
He had never thought of this. “Of course we can,” says he, “and
I know a short cut.”
I am delighted to hear this, as a short cut across the fields on a fine
day, in the midst of a lovely country, is a real treat to a Londoner.
ut as I knew my friend by this time (this is an after-consideration
as I write) why did I trust his head for remembering a short cut, even
when that short cut was to take him to his own home P Because I did
not know enough of my headless friend—but this is a warning to all
who have headless men, or women, among their acquaintance.
[I have just said Headless Women. I do not intend to say a word
on that subject. Let me merely observe that it would be too painful;
for of all the irritating, obstinate, wearying, perverse— oat I
have got into a cul-de-sac of a parenthesis, so gently round, Peggy
(familiar for Pegasus: gender not so much an object as absurdity), an
back again into the main road.]
We leave the Station.
“The house is about three-quarters of a mile from here,” he in-
forms me.
“Nothing,” I answer, with the true air of a Londoner when he first
* in the country, ready to do everything and anything athleti-
Cally.
“Let me see,” says he, pausing to consider. “Is it this stile, or
the next P” -
I cannot help him over either stile. He decides upon its being this,
not the next.
This decision, be it remembered, is that of a Headless Man: he fixes
upon what is before him: it is easiest of settlement: it is to hand:
and, above all, it makes him congratulate himself upon not being a
fellow who shilly-shallies.

So we climb over the stile, and take the field.
“I thought so,” he exclaims; “here’s a path.” He is delighted
with his own sagacity.
How came it that I didn’t notice this extraordinary pleasure at what
was, evidently, a discovery P No, I didn't. If I had, I should have
insisted upon going by the highway.
I ask him what those distant hills are.
“Those hills are—dear me—they’re-um-I forget the name.” I
don’t believe he had ever noticed them before.
“What county is that, then, eh?” is my next question.
“Eh! County? Eh P, Qh, that”— He hesitates. Up to this
moment the fact of there being a county near at hand never seems to
have struck him. -
“I suppose,” I say, “it’s Hertfordshire.”
He appears relieved by this supposition, and dismisses the matter.
We cross another field. The path in this commences fairly enough,
but ually loses itself in the grass.
“We must bear to the #. observes the Headless MILLER. At
i. moment I began to distrust, slightly, his topographical
euge
the right: it gives § a bias like that of a ball at Bowls, and you
don’t walk comfortably. -
However, we bear to the right, which is fast bringing us up against
an impeuetrable hedge, when I perceive a gate on the left. .
“Ah! yes,” says MILLER, “that's it: I’d forgotten it for a
moment: we bear to the right after the gate.” There is no sign of a
pathway in the next field, so I ask him if he is sure we are going in
the right direction for his house.
4. i. yes,” he replies, “my house ought to, lie out there.”—he
points to the north, and then corrects himself by directing his finger

“But,” I remind him, “you said it was only three-quarters of a
mile by road, and we’ve been nearly that distance already.”
“It is º by the ” he returns. “I’ve often walked
it; but this is the short cut.”
“Well, then,” I object; “itoughtn't to be more than half a mile this

8 No more it is,” he says, “if you know the way. But,” he adds,
slowly, looking about, “I’m not quite sure of it.”
Suddenly joy beams from his countenance.
“There it is 1”. he exclaims; “there's my house!” I see in the
south-west direction a roof rising above the trees: more than a mile
off, º: However, there it is, and we make for it, until we
come to a field where there are two flocks of sheep, two sheepdogs,
and no shepherds. We sit on the gate: both dogs dash towards us;
and we are back again, with the bars between us and the two fierce
beasts, in no time. . .
... We have to make a détour, and, while skirting the field, we catch
sº of a road at the end of the turnip-field.
artridges get up.
“We’d better get out of this as quickly as possible,” says MILLER,
ing to his heels. I protest I can’t run in this hot September, but
fancying I hear, a shout behind me, I do. In fact, as MILLER is
running, it would be unsociable in me not to join him. We are in the road.
“Now,” says the Headless. Man, looking round and about him,
“hang me if I can see my house anywhere.”
“But you know where you are,” I say to him. No, he doesn't—not
a bit. But where does this lane go to ? He hasn't the slightest idea,
But that was his house of which we saw the roof just now? “Oh,
}: hº answers, heartily—“Oh, yes; at least I think so; it was very
Afte iſ.”
This situation is most trying.
“We shall never get to your house by stopping here,” I remark,
axiomatically.
“No,” he answers, “but—which way shall we go?”
Now, on my word and honour, this is too absurd. A man takes me
down “to spend,” as the advertisements say of Rosherville, “a happy
day” at his own house, in his own place, and he doesn't know where
he lives, or if he does, as he says he does, “when he gets there,” hasn't
the slightest idea how to get there. Upon my word, I really haven't
patience with a-
“Stop!” I say to myself, “remember it is your own fault; you chose
as your companion a Headless Man.”
We reach his house after a hot, dusty walk. It isn't the one we saw
through the trees; nothing like it, and in quite a different direction.
- LER is there, and MRs. MILLER has got a head on her
shoulders., Our, luggage is sent for at once, my room is ready for me

orgotten.

busy, and every piece of business, whatever it is, interferes with every
know-
I know no such vague direction as being advised to bear ;
He has no excuse, except business: the Headless. Man is always
other piece of business, and there are no results.
He is great, as I have before hinted, on the subject of keeping
accounts. Although he puts them down occasionally, he can never be
said to keep them, as he loses account-book after account-book; or, if
he does retain one in use for a longer time than usual, he will turn it
upside down, and commence funny sketches for the garden at the other
end, or scratch unfinished portraits of nobodies, or he will put a fresh
marker in the very centre of the book, and then commence a diary,
with a vast amount of flourish as to particulars of time, date, and place.
I would dismiss the Headless Man at once, were it not for his pocket-
books, which, during my stay, we found in rummaging and clearing
out his room. These will be found worthy of the reader's examination
in a separate chapter; and, before I come to this end of the present
one, let me note this down for the general benefit: Never have any
pecuniary dealings with Headless Men.
| Better to lend a large than a small sum to a Headless Man.
The Headless Man never possesses, stamps, (Headless, you see, in
this sense, some one will say—only I’ve said it, now-Ah!) for his
letters. It is wonderful to what an extent a Headless Man may mulct
his friends in this small way. -
He never has any coppers. This reminds me that my Headless
Man is, above all men, most charitable. He cannot pass a beggar in
the street, specially a child º a snivelling Arab, without put-
ting his º in his pocket, and, not finding anything there, getting
companion to give it for him.
He will cross Waterloo Bridge, and any other where payment is
demanded, at his friend's expense. If a smoker, he never has cigars nor
lights. He is not stingy: not a bit: he is simply Headless, Take
him into a shop instead of giving him a cigar, and make him buy one,
or force him to get change for his shilling, sovereign, or whatever it may
be, and you’ll É. him a real service.
The Headless Man's pocket-books are such curiosities that, I must
let you see them, and then dismiss our species to the limbo of the other
genera of Odd Nien out.
FRENCH SOLDIERS AND SIRLOINS.
TREMBLE, John BuLL, if you ever did or ever will. The EMPEROR
or THE FRENch feeds his army upon beef. Four hundred thousand
soldiers of France consume 108,405. oxen a-year. Their ordinary
ration of beef is two pounds a-day. These figures are quoted by the
Gazette de France with reference to a meeting “ lately eld” by the
butchers of Paris, “to consider the dearness of meat"—and how to
maintain it? No, BLUEgowN and STEEL, dear friends—to “devise
means of remedying that evil.” The dearness of beef, they found, was
caused by the enormous consumption of the french Army. w at
shall we do now that beef has come to be the diet of the French soldier?
Will it be any longer possible, as the rule, for one Englishman of the
average type to beat three Frenchmen P During the great war with
BoNAPARTE the Good and True, an anonymous British bard put into
the mouth of a Mounseer, as our predecessors used to call a French-
man, a song wherein he is made to tell MR. BULL :—
“You say dat your beef make you not fear de gun;
But remember, Shon Engleesh, we make you to run
After us at Busaco and Barossa battle,
Where de guns zey did rorar and ze cannons did rattle.”
There will be no more singing in this strain, we shall, have to sing
small. Beef, now that French soldiers are kept upon it, will make
them not fear the gun, albeit the Armstrong gun or the Whitworth.
“Give them great meals of beef.” and “they will eat like wolves,” too
and doubtless also “fight like devils.” Who knows but what we shall
make them run after us, if ever, unhappily, we have to cross bayonets
with them P But there is robably an end of hand-to-hand fighting.
The battles of the future will most likely be fought out with artillery
and breech-loaders. Our neighbours will pot, their adversaries º,
Chassepots, and we shall pepper ours with Sniders. It will not much
matter on what meat men are bred to make food for powder. This
consideration may somewhat console the patriots who lament that the
British Grenadier must cease to be incomparable when the gallant
heroes across the Channel, nurtured upon beef, shall have acquired
their due proportions. Perhaps, if “O, the Roast Beef of Old England /?”
were ever sung now, it would soon require to be sung in a minor with
a rueful emphasis on the interjection. O, the old English Roast Beef,
indeed . It is in danger of being put out of joint by the Roast Beef of
La France. That must not º and the business of the War
Office now will be to take care that our Army shall be provided with
the very best of beef, and, whilst at least as well armed as that of
France, shall be so fed as to excel it in one thing, and maintain the
ancient superiority of British troops over French in that at any
rate.

Q. What is a Regular Nob? -
A. As aforesaid. Handle to name, tin, togs, and all complete.
Q: What is a Tip-top Swell ? -
A. Mostly Coves in four-in-'ands. From twenty to thirty-five.
Q. A Regular Swell ?
A. He is a older cove—from thirty-five to fifty. He rayther runs to
fat, but there ain't a speck on him anywhere, and his boots and tile are
out-and-out. - -
Q. The terms Cheap Swell, Gent, and Snob require no explanation.
What, then, is a Cockywax * -
7. It’s a term of endearment, and may include any of the above, or
may be a class by itself, without a swell or nob in it. Cockywaxes are
any age. If addressing a Cockywax you qualify it by prefixing “old”
or “young.” - -
Q. You mention Togs, whence is this word derived P
A. Undoubtedly from the Latin Toga. “Togs” means dress.
Q. When was the word Core first used ?
Printed
& J h Rmith, of 24, Holford Square, in the Parish of 8t. James, Clerkenwell, in the County of Middlesex, at the
street, ºf the Precinct of whiterº, in the city of London, and Published by him at No. 3, Fleet street, in the Farish of st. Bri
.4. It was imported by the Romans, and was first used in an abbre-
vinted form by the British whenever they saw a Covinarius, i.e., a
soldier in a war-chariot.

It now appears—to those who didn’t know before—that when a
stranger ſº his way by chance into the room wherein these Bulls
and Bears transact their business, instead of being civilly informed that
it is private, and being shown out by an attendant, he is immediately set
upon by the society which he has fallen amongst, bonneted, hustled,
and forcibly extruded. This is much the sort of way in which anyone
would be treated if he were to tumble into a real bear-pit; only that
there the bears would tear him to pieces, which the members of the
Stock Exchange are of course restrained from doing by the fear of
CALCRAFT. Their maltreatment of strangers evinces a rudeness an
ferocity remarkably characteristic indeed of bears, but not of bears
only. Bulls, for example, can exhibit just the same qualities; and the
Bulls of the Stock Exchange show themselves equally savage with the
Bears. . It is not, therefore, by the “Bears of the Stock Exchange,”
inº that strangers are attacked, but by both the Bears and
Bulls in conjunction; in a word, by the Brutes of the Stock Exchange.
Were you aware, Mr. Punch, that the City, of which you are the
boast, contains such brutes as those same Bulls of Basan, and Bears P
If so, surely, for all your objection to old English sports attended with
suffering to animals, you would ere, this have diverted the British
Public with a little -baiting and Bear-baiting. At least you might
have produced a pictorial exhibition of certain Bulls tethered and
“pinned,” and Bears muzzled and undergoing the punishment of being
worried by dogs, or forced to dance, in a shameful and ridiculous
Inanner.
It is not, however, only the Stock Exchange, of all places in the City
of London, which is tenanted by ferocious creatures. Brutes equally
savage infest the neighbourhood of Lombard Street, where, the other
Friday, afternoon, they collected in a pack, like wolves, or hyaenas,
howled at, pelted, and otherwise assailed the congregation issuing from
the church of St. Edmund the King, wherein they had been listening
to a sermon preached by FATHER IGNATIUs. They had heard that, in
one of his previous discourses delivered, there, IGNATIUs had compared
| London to Jericho, had called their class Yº: of the golden
calf, and money makers in general thieves; . If real hyaenas and wolves
could understand human speech, no doubt they likewise would have
flown, tooth and nail, at anybody whom they understood to have said
that they were greedy, bloodthirsty, and cruel.
| FATHER IGNATIUs, while he was ºns the monk, shaved his head.
Thereby, perhaps, he did himself good. , He has now taken to boots
again, is decently clothed, and seems to be in his #|| mind, at least
in as far as he preaches home truths. But even if he continued to
reach Popery, mock or real, to beset, and fall upon, and pitch into

like the jackass. It promotes a *ś to the dignity of a con-

PUNCH*S HANDBOOK FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
LEAMINGTON.
NE MR. BENJAMIN SATch-
well, a shoemaker, in the
year 1784, who, not content
with improving the soles
of his §. men, was de-
sirous of renovating their
bodies also, discovered a
very remarkable saline
spring. He was probably
an ancestor of the more
modern follower of the
same craft who invented
side-springs. A friend of
SAtchwell's, one WIL-
LIAM ABBOTs, a worthy
licensed victualler, and
landlord of “The Dog,”
established some baths,
and Leamington is really
indebted for its present,
popularity to these enº.
prising bath chaps. The
young watering-place was
also written up” by the
Morning Chronicle, who
proved a friend to its
#. for it, published
ttering articles on the
infant’s spa. DR. LAMBE,
of Warwick, wrote a trea-
tise, on the waters, which
was very clever of him, and several other springs were discovered, culminating
in one great spring into popularity, which flowed on successfully until the .
e ~
time, and will no doubt continue to do so whilst there are so many who
in its
Mineral Waters:-These are twelve in number, and of the usual sort—Chaly-
beate, involuntarily recalling WELLER, Junior's “warm flat-iron” comparison;
sulphureous, suggestive of a decoction of lucifer-matches, and saline, which are simply
nasty. It is as well, they say, to consult one of the resident medical men (who by
long habit have almost induced themselves to believe that the waters have some
effect on their patients) before indulging to any great extent in this most unplea-
sant, beve People who have chronic biliousness flºº ceaseless spirit-
imbibing will derive "... from occasional draughts of the Leamington water;
It is in two senses salutory for “hard livers.” It is said that the proper period
wherein to test the efficacy of the waters is a month, Lodging-house keepers say
two, but we mistrust their motives, Lazy people should jump at them, and they
should be, if possible, drunk, at the spring. This, however, requires practice.
More than two good-sized pailfuls at a draught would be injudicious on a first
..". The dose, however, may be increased, and if the patient lives he should
go in 10r
Bathing.—This is a healthful pursuit at all times, and even at home, in connec-
tion with soap and a rough towel, may be safely indulged in by the most timid.
Shower; tepid, sulphureous, vapour, and gold baths may be all obtained in perfec-
tion at i.eamington. More than three of each sort daily are not recommended to
nervous patients at first. They are not expensive, and stout people will find that
in the case of hot baths there is “a considerable reduction in taking a quantity.”
Should they make the patient ill, he may rely upon it they disagree with him.
Analysis of the Waters.-Without descending to decimal fractions, we are given
to understand that an imperial pint contains as follows:–
Sulphate of Somethingorother . 35 grains.
Chloride of Whatd’yecallit . 30
Bicarbonate of Kafoozleum - - - 2 ”
We confess at this juncture to having lost the paper on, which this highly in-
teresting analysis was elaborately given. We believe we dropped it somewhere
between Brunswick Street and Lillington Place; or on second thoughts, it may
have been in Jephson's Gardens, or possibly on the Rugby Road: The visitor
should not miss the Royal Assembly Rooms or the Royal Music Hall, the Jephson
Gardens, or the Tennis Court (of which place a poor demented player once re-
marked, that for one ball missed, ten is caught, but he was at once seen to by his
friends); and last, but not least, in all seriousness,
The Warneford Hospital, called after the worthy rector of Burton-on-the-Hill,
Gloucestershire. This supplies baths and medicines to the poor. Werb. Sap. “The
smallest donations ºil. received.”
SCARBOROUGH.
Nobody, knows anything about its foundation, but as it has stood so many years,
there can be no doubt that the foundation is pretty strong. The name is Saxon,
->
and was originally Skardaborgar, and a very pretty name too. HAROLD HARDRADA,
who ought to have known better, destroyed it in 1066;
and though accustomed to stormy gales, the town was some
time in recovering from this tremendous blow. This is
scarcely to be wondered at, after being utterly demolished
it does take some little time to recover oneself. We have
all felt that, and why shouldn’t Scarborough.
It has frequently been sieged. PIERs GAVESTON, Earl
of Cornwall, fled here, but was forced to surrender. Other
Piers have given way at watering-places, since his time.
In 1536 Robert AskE, leader of the Pilgrims of Grace
(grace, indeed!) tried to take the Castle, but he failed
and in his case it was by no means a case of “aske an
have.” Some chroniclers state that the Castle was taken
once by a son of LoRD STAFFORD. Other historians, how-
ever, say it was taken by Stratagem. Our time is too
valuable to waste any of it in deciding, which was in the
right. The Castle was besieged twice by the Parliamen-
tarians, and the garrison held out for twelve months on
the first occasion, until at starvation point, then having no
more provisions to give out, it was naturally obliged to
give in.
The Spa -The reputation of Scarborough, resembles
* j and mainly, rests upon two springs. They were
found out by a lady, who discovered perpetual spring, if
she didn’t everlasting youth. . A slight earthquake, in
1737, buried the springs, but a hardy and adventurous per-
son nerved himself to the task, and after looking about
for some days, eventually found them hiding artfully in a
corner. The visitor should by no means miss the
Spa Saloon.—A Spa-cious building, in which entertain-
ments of all kinds are given. The term “given' must
not of course be taken in its literal sense; a sum is charged
for admission. Music from the ºf strains of a
MozART, down to the modern effusions of a MACKNEy,
may be heard during the season at this popular establish-
ment. Gentlemen who dive under desks, and re-appear
with another name and another wig, sombre minstrels of
the plantation, with a tendency to harmonise everything
they sing, and always possessing one big black fellow
with a maddening falsetto, ladies from La iii and gen-
tlemen from the Royal Ritolderol Music with an
overwhelming weakness for unlimited Chorus, conjurors
lecturers, concert parties and Shakspearian readers, a
patronise the Spa Saloon, and its influence is therefore
antagonistic to
The Theatre, which is a very well-conducted little place,
and where you may often see London Stars in a popular
Comety.
How to Take the Waters.-One reliable authority states,
“ those who are in health may drink the water ad libitum.”
Punch's advice is, “add something else.”
A PLEA FOR THE PILLORY.
THE good old times | The rare old times' One can-
* well help sighing for them when one reads a bit like
ls :-
“In 1311 a baker was imprisoned for offering putrid bread for
sale; and in 1316 two bakers were drawn on hurdles through
the streets of the metropolis and pilloried for using false weights.
In 1319 WILLIAM SPELYNG was fixed in the #. whilst the
putrid carcasses of two bullocks found in his shop were burnt
under his nose; and in 1348 two similar punishments for similar
crimes are recorded against delinquent butchers.”
Cruel P. Well, yes, possibly. But are not bakers cruel,
when they cheat poor half-fed people by giving them short
weight : Small tradesmen often are big rogues: of this
at every Sessions there is offered ample proof; and the
worst are they who cheat the poor in food and drink.
These small tradesmen make large profits, and can easily
afford to snap their fingers at the fines, which are
nowadays imposed on them for swindling in their shops.
It would be a fine thing for the poor if fines were no
more suffered, and a fine, sight it would be to see a baker
in the pillory, or whipped at his shop door for having sold
short weight. Cheating such as this is virtually stealing,
and deserves a harsher punishment than payment of a
fine, an item, which is simply classed among the trade
expenses, and paid out of the profits of the next half.
score of thefts. . If we merely fine a shop-keeper for rob-
bing by false weights, we ought merely to fine a burglar or
a pickpocket, and we ought to shut our prisons against
every sort of thief.

LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE JUDGE'S DREAM.
THE Court in which I did preside
Was close, and I myself was tried
By heat, and want of air,
Whence ventilation's needful gale
Cleared not the fumes which crowds exhale,
In courts of justice that prevail,
And soap and water spare.
The case was like to last a week.
Night came ; I smoked cigars: to seek
My pillow then was fain.
And, as I lay reclined in bed,
I had a vision of the head,
It may be of tobacco bred;
I was in Court again.
Methought that on their verdict, late,
The Jury, to deliberate, -
#. for some hours, retired;
And there I sat upon the Bench,
And tried, with gin-and-watery drench,
In vain the raging thirst to quench
Wherewith my throat was fired.
The Foreman entered, and, said he,
“My Lord, the jury can't agree;
Wo chance they will to-night.”
I said, “I’m sorry, Gentlemen,
For your predicament, but then,
Together, in exclusive pen,
You must await the light.
“The officer, no doubt, to make
You comfortable all, will take
Such measures as he can.
But must, by law ordained of old,
Permit you, shut within that fold,
Communication none to hold
With any other man.”
“My Lord,” the Sheriff said, “and you
Apart I must imprison too,
Until this trial’s o’er.
In strictest custody confined,
As the new Act—need I remind -
Your Lordship ?—me perforce both bind.”
I cried, “Oh, what a bore l’’
Lock up the Judge too! On my word
That locking up is most absurd;
Such hardship might provoke
A very saint to curse and swear
And stamp, and dance, and rend his hair.

But oh, if 'twere a bad time spent

ELECTION ADDRESSES.
| -
!
IV.--THOROUGHLY TEETOTAL.
To the Electors of Coldstream.
GENTLEMEN,
YoU know me as an ardent spirit, as a man with but one idea
and aim—the idea that all our national ailments would
water cure, the aim to advocate and extend the power of the Pump.
| You will, therefore, not be surprised if in this address I am a total
abstainer from every topic but Teetotalism. In my eyes Parliamentary
Reform is insignificant in comparison with Public-House Reform; in
my eyes Compulsory Sobriety is more important than Compulsory
Education, and the evils of the Irish Church far less than those of
Irish Whiskey. In the minds of many there is alarm lest our Institu-
tions should be overthrown by the men whom they denounce as Repub-
licans: I am bent on defeating a still more dangerous enemy—the
Publicans.
Some election addresses are so spirited as to make one suspect that
they were written under the influence of alcohol: mine will not be of
that character; not extravagant, but, temperate, indeed more than
temperate-teetotal. Others are so mild as to deserve the term milk-
and-water: mine will escape that reproach, for it will be all water.
I have never, required pumping about my intentions, should you
send me to Parliament as your representative. My ambition is to form
a great water-party, at Westminster, and deluge every Government
with motions, questions, petitions, remonstrances, and objections, all
flowing to the same point–National Teetotalism. I expect to have
gold water thrown on my projects—cold water will only brace and
invigorate me for renewed exertions. . To ridicule I am indifferent: I
dread ºpº much more, lest I should be intoxicated by it.
One of the first things I shall do, in the House will be to object to
that item in the Navy Estimates which deals in rum. all move to
substitute the word “cocoa,” with “chocolate” for the officers. This
will expose me to intemperate language: I care not, if I can only save
! Our nt sailors from being half-seas over. . If I stand alone, as I am
proud to say I have been able to do through life, I will propose the
imposition of the heaviest taxes on wine, spirits, and tobacco; for a
pipe of tobacco and a pipe of wine are equally obnoxious to me. I
shall broach the subject of the erection of drinking-fountains out of
the public (house), money, in every inhabited spot in the British
dominions. No half-and-half measures will go down with me. Stricter
| licensing regulations and the closing of public-houses on Sunday ma
content some: such sipping legislation will not satisfy my thirst.
would close the public-houses altogether: they have been allowed too
much licence already. ... I would prohibit the sale of all intoxicating
liquors, except for medicinal purposes, and I hope the time is near
when an enlightened profession will label brandy as eau-de-mort instead
of eau-de-vie. The manufacture of beer I would attack with bitter
hostility; the cultivation of barley (except for barley-water) should be
made a penal offence; I would suffer no more malt-kilns to be built:
hop-yards should be converted into strawberry beds, and I would
compel the owners of orchards in the cider counties to make a declara-
tion that the fruit had been used, solely for cooking purposes and
desserts. Why should not our public dinners be conducted on the
toast-and-water principle * Why should not wine-parties at our Uni-
versities be followed by rustication? Why should not the Legislature
set a bright example, by interdicting the sale of all stimulants (including
currant and other home-made wines) in their own Refreshment Rooms?
I would limit the Clubs to the consumption of the stocks now in their
cellars. I would have inspectors of wedding-breakfasts and super-
intendents of evening parties appointed. I would only permit pic-nics
in the grounds attached to temperance hotels; and I would have all
convivial songs licensed by the Lord Chamberlain before publication.
I hope to live to see the day when dictionaries will no longer explain
Gin as “a trap or snare ; ” I hope to welcome the hour when only the
antiquary, and philologist will understand such ..". as runn
ºl. jã Tom yº. brandy-cocktail, sherry-cobbler, Kinahan's
, and London stout. Soda I would restrict to wash-
ing purposes, and the sober orange should never be contaminated by
association with the dissolute bitters. -
I know what my opponents are saying of me; that I am suffering
from water on the brain, that my speech on the hustings will be a
water-spout, that I have not three grains of sense in my flead (this by
the brewing interest), and that I shall be the butt (this by the wine-
merchants) of the House, when I enter it., Let them pour out their
long bottled-up rage; I heed it not, provided you take the water-side.
It is almost superfluous to add that mine will be a dry election;
those disgraceful scenes of violence in which eyes have more than once
been bunged-up will cease to occur, when barrels of beer cease to flow.
will tap nothing but the shoulder. My head-quarters and Committee
Room are at the Temperance Hotel, where I hope to address you on
Monday next after an early tea. Your faithful Servant,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MRS. PUNCH's LETTERS TO HER DAUGHTER.
EAR DAUGHTER,-
— "if it is advisable
for ladies to think
twice before mak-
ing a speech, my
advice to those
ladies about to pub-
lish a book is—
think three times,
and then don’t do
it. Ah! little did
E I imagine what I
# was bringing upon
myself when, out of
the fulness of my
maternal affection
and patriotic soli-
citude for the Im-
rovement of the
ex, I committed
= myself to print in
a public journal.
For, though I set
- out on my literary
career with the in-
= tention of confining
myself to domestic
litics and Par-
our, instead of
Political Economy
I am driven," nodens rolens, which means, º, scurried, an
flurried, into the current, of public affairs, and where I shall be
driven to, if indeed I shall ever be driven anywhere, I don’t know.
For only think of it, my dear JUDIANA, here in this quiet little
Suffolk *† my sins—i.e., my authorship—has found me
out. As I walk along in the humblest manner, wearing, as does
HER MAJESTY on her travels, a broad-brimmed straw hat, I hear
#. little boys cry after me, with rude boyish gestures—
“There goes Mrs. Punch, who writes letters to her daughter 1’’
What lady’s feelings would not be hurt by such conduct? but that
is not the worst. What with the Elections, the speech of Miss BECKER
at the Social Science Meeting, and other inflammatory matters, the
ladies in the country who know very little about the real state of things,
are beside themselves with excitement: so what must they do but get
up deputations to me, taking it for granted that Mrs. Punch would place
herseſ at the head of the female fiberal Party and take by storm, one
after the other, every remaining stronghold of Masculine Tyranny.
Now, º both Mr. Punch and your mother think that too much
cannot be done in the way of making women happier and more useful
by giving them plenty of education and occupation, and do honour to
the wise and temperate crusaders . inst follies, we are always anxious
to check the zeal of the over-hot and inconsiderate.
Having gone out of the way to make this explanation, I will now
relate to you what has happened to disturb my mind from its quiet
contemplations of Seaside §. such as Sand-hoppers, Engaged
Couples, Sea-weeds, fast young ladies, and so on.
As I was settling my weekly accounts then, with our good landlady
Mrs. Mealymouth, we heard a tramping sound as of a file of soldiers
marching. We both gave a little scream, thinking MR. BEALEs or the
Fenians might have something to do with it, but on looking up, beheld
an army of ladies, who drew up round the door, and by the mouth of
their spokeswomen clamoured to see Mrs. Punch. Qh! what an awful
moment was that, and what a lesson for ladies with literary and philan-
thropic aspirations.
The first deputation consisted of Girls of the Period, who, after a
gºod deal of giggling, º: whispering, were, so far silent as to
allow, their spokeswoman, s FITz SWELL, to deliver the following
speech:-
Hºnoured Madam,_We, the highly misused and agitated Girls of
the Period, shall be very glad to enrol our names on the voting lists,
always provided those mischievous old things, the revising barristers,
tº us; but we wish you to consider our difficulty regarding a
Candidate, and to advise us, if possible. What we want is a repre-
* under thirty years of age, with a handsome beard and j
Here the speaker was interrupted by a voice that said,
Not black eyes, please, ANNIE; blue is my favourite colour.”
Th; speaker cried out, “For shame,,GRAcre,” and went on—
He must be the most gentlemanly of beings, and able, both in
speaking and writing, to cut up our adversaries and detractors into
Inºcemeat; we mean those horribly critical creatures who find fault
with us, and want us to leave of chignons and Sensational novels, and
all that sort of ...; Things are coming to such a pass that we are
growing quite alarmed, and expect one of these days to be pounced
upon by the Social Science people, and carried off to some elegant re-
formatory for so many months–not of penal servitude—but of mental
improvement. We should not so much object to go to Cambridge, as
a Lady proposed in Macmillan’s Magazine, and study in the house of
an M.A., provided some nice young men would help us to learn our
lessons; but we object on principle to having our minds improved. .
Now, Mrs. Punch, if you can recommend us a Candidate who will
fulfil the following qualifications, we will give him our support, and
persuade Papa to do the same :-
He must be handsome, and at least five feet ten inches in height.
He must waltz to perfection, and be able to read poetry aloud.
He must be of High Church principles, and amiable disposition.
He must strictly oppose all the tendencies of the age towards im-
proving Ladies' minds, and be ready to fight a duel with any one
impertinent enough to hint that they need it.
e must not be over-clever or fond of politics, except as they imme-
diately concern the welfare of the Girls of the Period.
I said that I would see what could be done for them, and the Depu-
tation then retired. One young lady ran back two minutes afterwards
to say, “Florence sent her i. and forgot to say that she thought
they could do more with a Curate than anybody, if Mrs. Punch would
be so good as to recommend one.”
The next Deputation consisted of ladies who had formed themselves
into a body called The Anti-Domestic-Liberty-League. Some members
of the Deputation were single or widows, and all householders, thus
fulfilling the qualification for the franchise. The speaker, Mas. REv.
DRIVER, laid down their grievances as follows:—
The * of independence among domestic servants was growing so
intolerable, that nothing but parliamentary measures of the severest
kind could put a curb upon it. The undersigned ladies were prepared
to support any Candidate for their Borough who should pledge himself
to introduce the following Bills:—
1st. A Bill to make it illegal and punishable, by fine, for any young
woman in domestic service to wear chignons, curls, crinolines, or
dresses of any kind, except such as meet the sanction of her mistress.
2nd. A Bill to make sound Church principles compulsory on all
servants whatever, and the offence of attending a Methodist Chapel
amenable to the law.
3rd. A Bill to put a stop to sweethearts, valentines, love-letters and
light literature, restricting the kitchen library to tracts and works of
all "Fºls nature. - - --
4. A Bill to render warnings invalid, except on the side of the
mistress.
Puzzled as I had been by the first Deputation, I felt stillmore turned
mentally topsy-turvy by this, and the Ladies' severe looks only added
to my agitation. I contrived to say that I was much obliged to them,
or that they were very welcome, or something equally incoherent, when
the Speaker of the Third Deputation began —
Respected Mrs. Punch,-We, the undersigned, Members of the
Aggrieved-Authors, Artist,-and-Philanthropic-League, all entitled to
vote, either as householders or lodgers, beg to offer our support to any
Member who will bring our case before Parliament.
We say it with all modesty, we are Fº aspirants for the emolu-
ments of the Civil List, and our ungrateful country refuses to acknow-
ledge our claims. One of us, for the present we omit names out of
delicacy, worked like a slave in the cause of the Emancipation of the
Shoshones Squaws; another sent out a mission to establish the Legal
Equality of the Sexes amongst the Cannibal Tribes on the Gold Coast;
a third wrote a book proving that all men are monsters; a fourth
established a Convalescent Home for Cats ; a fifth established Classes
for instructing Destitute Children in AEsthetics and the Love of the
Beautiful, gratis; a sixth offered a Prize of Fifty Pounds to the lady
who should write the best treatise on the “Connection of Transcen-
dental Mathematics, Lucifer Matches, and the Political Position of
Women,” which Prize has not yet been drawn. We would humbly
suggest our claims to any gentleman desirous of qur support, and beg
to add that tea and such humble hospitalities will be offered to his can-
vassers—provided he possesses the most unmitigatedly liberal opinions.
The ladies then withdrew.
Oh! my JUDIANA, imagine the feelings, and sympathise with the
embarrassment of your perplexed, and would-be Un-political, Mother,
MRs. PUNCH.
A Cynic on the Supplement to the Times.
THE Births I don’t regard a jot ;

“The frigate Victoria, which had appeared before Corunna, retired in
consequence of the attitude assumed by the Captain-General.”
..What scope this announcement affords for the conception of a grand
historical picture!. In the whole range of profane history there is only
one instance at all nearly parallel to the wonderful fact which it pro-
claims. That occurred at the last siege of Acre, where, the garrison
immediately laid down their arms on the appearance of ADMIRAL SIR
CHARLEs NAPIER in the breach, when he raised his walking-stick:
This, however, was too simple a gesture to be suitable for pictorial
illustration. But if there is any British Artist sufficiently endowed
with that sense of grandeur which is characteristic of Continental
genius, he can embody it in a portrait of the Captain-General of
Corunna, as he appeared in the attitude in consequence of which the
Wictoria retired.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. -
ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS.
(CoNTINUED.)
No one but a Headless Man would put an ordinary friend in pos.
session of his pocket-books, note-books, and diaries for many years
past. But a Headless Man foresees nothing, and has no memory
unless suddenly jogged, when it shoots up brilliantly for a few seconds,
and then, just as you think it is about to illumine the darkness for
some time to come, it sputters, gutters, and goes out, on that particu-
lar subject at least. Did you ever burn red fire during the representa-
tion of the Miller and his Men (SKELT's scenes and characters, so much
lain and so much more coloured) on the stage of your nursery theatre :
}; so, you will remember sprinkling an extra pinch of the powder on
the expiring sparks still twinkling in the pan; up it, flamed, bright
and . as ever, and then down again, leaving nothing behind except a
hot pan which burnt your fingers, and disappointment, which ended in
a difference with your nurse on the subject of bed-time. So, with my
Headless Man's memory: it flares up, and throws a warm light upon
the past: suddenly it is almost extinguished : scatter a few grains of
memoranda over it, and it is again enlivened for a short time, and
there's an end.
It was while I was staying with MILLER (not the one with “the
men.” just alluded to, but the Headless, MILLER, my friend of former
chapters), that it suddenly occurred to him to tidy his room.
his is a peculiarity of Headless Men: they pride themselves on
extreme neatness.
MILLER says to me, “My dear fellow, I know where every book
every pipe, everything, anything, is in my room. I can put my han
upon it as well in the dark as in the light.”
This assertion I find is literally true: he can put his hand upon it,
whatever it is, equally as well in the dark as in the light, and a nice
mess he makes of the attempt at any time.
“Here,” he says, indicating a small drawer, “I keep my gloves.
Say I want my riding gloves: well, I open this drawer, and—”
He opens it, and we find packets of newſº envelopes, and pens.
“By Jove l’ he exclaims, forgetting all about his gloves and his
admirable arrangements, “I’ve been looking for these things for the
last three weeks. Now that’s very odd.”
I remind him that he had expected his gloves to be there.
“Gloves,” he says, º considering the subject, and eyeing the
papers and envelopes with the pleasure of a true discoverer. “Yes—
gloves. , Yes, yes. Gloves ought to be here. But,” he continues,
cheerfully turning to me, and extracting as it were a moral of praise
for his own carefulness, “You see this just bears me out. I knew I’d
put these packets away carefully—because I always have a drawer for
everything—and,” he adds, triumphantly, “here they are.”
He is quite satisfied with this proof of his forethought and care :
“here they are.” He shuts the drawer up, and on my asking where
then he keeps his gloves, he dismisses the subject as one of not the
slightest importance in comparison with having found these papers.
“Oh,” he says, “the gloves are down-stairs, in the hall somewhere.
It's all right. I know where to find them when I want ’em,” from
which I º infer that, as he doesn’t want them at that moment, he
doesn’t at that moment know where to find them. In fact, he takes
very much the sort of devil-may-care view of the matter which the
adviser of Little Bopeep did when counselling her to leave her sheep
to their own devices, as the probability was that they’d return,
following their noses.
Now this is how we came to “tidy” his room.
After the episode of the gloves and the papers, he sits at his writing-
table º, observes, thoughtfully, “What have i got to do to-day—let
me See :
In order to let him see clearly, I go on with the perusal of my news-
paper, and say nothing; but I watch him.
e searches for a pen everywhere, then he rings the bell, then he
walks to the window and looks out. The servant answers the bell.
“Did you ring, Sir P” asks the maiden.
“Yes,” MILLER, replies slowly, looking first at MARY and then at
me, as if I had had something to do with it (which is objectionable
in a s e house, where you can imagine, the servants saying,
“What’s want here, coming ringing the bells, and a-giving us
hextra trouble * * because they don’t know what they’re going to get
when you º
...Yes,’ says he, deliberately, “I rang.”
This, though a plain answer to a plain question, is of course not
enough, because no man in his senses would ring a beli merely for the
sake of telling the servant who came up that he fi rung. I suggest,
seeing MARy uncomfortable, that he wanted something.
“Yes, I did,” he returns, as if choosing out of a number of things
one that he really did require.
“You wanted a pen? didn't you?” I ask, diffidently, being some-
what afraid of offending him.
Offend him not in the least. He is delighted. Yes, that’s it—a
pen :-will MARY get him some pens !
She will; and instead of stepping out of the room, steps into it, and
from a basket, on MILLER's writing-table, under MILLER's nose, pro-
duces a bundle.
I think the Headless MILLER is a little ashamed of himself for a
second or so.
“I never saw that,” he says to me, apologetically. MARY smiles,
and wants to know if there is anything more he wants.
“No,” he answers, promptly; then, as she is closing the door, he
repeats hesitatingly,
“No : I—I think not.” She is gone.
“There was something else,” I hear him saying to himself when she
has left; “but I can't remember what it was.”
Then follows a search for writing-paper, then for a blotting-pad,
which he says he only bought the other day, and where the servants
ut these things he tells me, puzzles him. ... I stop him from ringing the
ell, and easily find everything he wants for him. Indeed, they are all
before him, which circumstance he points out to me, as I find them,
in proof of his own care and arrangement.
An hour goes in this way, before he sits down fairly to consider his
plans for the day.
The Headless Man's formula of expression invariably implies the
result of a sudden discovery of a line of duty, commencing F.
with an adjuration addressed eitherto Jove, or to that deity of modern
mythology, Jingo.
The formula is, “By Joye | I ought”—to whatever, it may be.
On this present occasion he commences saying in a quiet manner,
which is even more startling than his other way of rapping out his
discoveries,
“By Jingo I ought to see about those taxes to-day.”
Taxes are an endless trouble to a Headless Man. He never will
attend to them, or rates either, under the last penalties of an execution
in the house, when he writes an indignant letter and most probably
forgets to inclose the cheque.
“Yes,” he continues, “I must see about those taxes.” Here he notes
down on a slip of paper, “taxes.” “And then I ought to write to that
man about the drains, and the wine,”—notes down “drains,” “wine.”
“I ought to go and see about the hedges being mended in that field;
and, ah! I know I’ve got some letters to answer,”—notes down “answer
letters.” “I wonder where the deuce”—here follows a rummaging for
the letters he has got to answer, an accumulation of, it is impossible to
say, how many weeks, including some unopened, which we find are not
bills, as he had ..". but on matters of more or less importance,
generally in a social way.
At this moment a knock at the door interrupts his search. It is
MRs. MILLER, who wants to know whether he called at the Glass
Warehouse yesterday in town, and also whether he brought down the
oil and vinegar from the Italian shop in the Haymarket, and ordered
the fish and ice at the fishmonger's by the Station.
“You know, Joseph,” she says, with an air of sorrowful reproach,
“I wrote them all down for you.”
“By Jove l’’ exclaims the unfortunate MILLER, “so you did.”
And here he commences patting his chest and sides, which is his way
of º; his pockets, when he suddenly remembers that this wasn’t
the coat he had on yesterday.
“But,” remonstrates MRs. MILLER, sensibly, “you haven't got the
oil and the things in that.”
No, of course he hasn’t, but he wants to assure himself of having
the list still about him. -
“Yes,” she continues pertinaciously; “but did you do what I
wanted you?”
No, he is obliged to own he had not: but, if he hadn't the list with
him, it will be clearly shown why he didn’t. The list, however, is
found in his breast-pocket, carefully folded up, and enclosed in an
undirected envelope, “I knew I’d taken great care of it,” he says, and
is almost as much pleased as if he had executed all the orders.
MRs. MILLER is annoyed. MILLER is ready for the emergency.
“Telegraph,” says he. Rs. MILLER objects that this costs money,
and that as he really had nothing to think of in town, yesterday
except what she had given him to do, he might have attended to her
commissions.
So the scene ends.
(To be Continued.)

for of whom else can he be speaking when he says, “Nullo imbre, nullo

If you want to go from the City to Hammersmith, and are near
the Moorgate Station, whence the trains start regularly every
twenty minutes, go by rail. Otherwise, get into a 'bus. It is practi.
cally, the quicker way. Unless, you carry a time-table in your head,
and know exactly when your train is due, you may be a little too late,
and have to wait for the next. If you don't keep a sharp look-out,
you will miss that.
. When you do travel by the Metropolitan Railway, mind these direc-
tions. , Take, a third-class ticket. yhow, never take a first. The
second and third class carriages are obvious; the first you may have
to run up or down for. At intermediate stations the train sometimes
stops only a few seconds; and, if you don’t jump in at once, will be off
without you.
As you will find no one on the platform who can or will give you
any information, always get into the first train that arrives. Hold the
carriage door. open until the Guard comes to shut it, and then shout
out your destination. If you are right for it, he will most likely tell
you; if you are not, you can get out again.
In like manner, if you are bound for any other station than the ter.
minus, open the door at .# one you come to, and ask which it is.
You will thus probably succeed in getting an answer. -
nless you are so familiar with the line as to be able to recognise
every station at a glance, you will scarcely ever know which is which.
The porters still continue to shout “Oosh! Oosh!” for Shepherd's
Bush, and “Nil!, Nil!” (which of course is nothing) for Notting
Hill; never articulating the name of any station. The Gaulois, the
other day, stated that the town of Gerond had made a pronunciamento.
§§ y, that is never done by the attendants of the Metropolitan
Ilway.
This indistinctness is all the more remarkable from its contrast with
the particularly clearvoices of the newsboys. “Times, Pall Mall Gazette,
Daily Telegraph, Standard, Star, Punch /?” you hear these youths sing
out as loud and plain as any cathedral canon could possibly intone the
service. Of course. They are paid to sell the papers. They are
interested in making themselves heard.
As you can seldom hear, so neither can you hardly ever, see, on the
Metropolitan line, the name of the station which your train has stopped
at. It is posted up on a single board, so that the chances against your
catching a sight of it are numerous. -
Once, again, then, take care to open the door eyer. time your train
*:::: and keep bawling, “Hoy! wº. is this?” till you are told,
owever, the Metropolitan Railway is, as Iago says of wine, “A good
familiar creature, if it be well used.” At any rate, it is an institution
commendable in one respect, as being eminently calculated to foster
habits of vigilance, activity, and self-help.

Cook. “WELL, you see, MUM, As You prEFERs A TAKING MY PLACE IN THE

TOO MUCH CLARET.
CoNCERNING the poor ex-QUEEN of SPAIN, the Times truly remarks:–
“She is a fugitive in a country where one of her own subjects reigns: one whom a fort-
night ago she might have met on equal terms.”
Yes. The sometime subject of Isa BELLA THE SEcond does reign. Does she not
also govern ? Is that not the reason why French troops occupy Rome? Would the
Elect of the French People prevent the Roman People from electing their own Sove-
reign if he were not himself under petticoat government? In a sense, to be sure,
it may be denied that he is under the government so called. We know what
rments Is ABELLA, the other day, expressed a wish to wear. It may be said
that Isa BELLA's subject, that was, has renounced crinoline, and actually does wear
the garments which Isa BELLA named. Do we not know that she has set ladies
the fashion of wearing Hessian boots? Considering boots as Hessian boots, one
naturally associates boots with nether garments other than petticoats. When the
wife wears those other garments, of course the husband is not under petticoat
government. No : he is under a government, which Qught to be petticoat, but
isn't. What, however, if in that case, she herself is under a government of
petticoats, that is to say, a government, of priests? What, if a great nation is
governed by its Elect and he is governed by his consort, and she by the Jesuits
and Ultramontane clergy? This, perhaps. ISABELLA THE SEgoND is now an
awful example to Continental Sovereigns., . She is suffering from the conse-
quences of too much CLARET. The same kind of excess—not in Lafitte, look
you, or Château Margaux—in France may affect another in the same way.
There is a lady, once IsabelLA’s subject, whom, as the Times says, a fortnight ago
she might have met on equal terms, If French olicy continues to be swayed by
Ultramontane dictation, who knows but that #4. Isa BELLA and that other
lady with her husband, may very shortly meet on equal terms once more?
TEMPESTUOUS.
A short time ago, the papers had articles about “Spain and the Tornado.”
Such a heading would be particularly appropriate now when the storm has burst.

And little arms and º
And this was in a subbub, which

A. coRREspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette,
writing from Rome, says, speaking of two new
Cardinals, “To-morrow their Eminences will receive
the hat in a public consistory, which will be suc-

ceremony of opening and shutting the mouth.”
How is this to be understood? If by “opening the
mouth”, is meant being allowed to say, what you
really think, the ceremony—if it is anything more
than a ceremony—must be as agreeable as it is
unusual at Rome, and perhaps it is as well for the
Papal power that it is a secret one: “shutting the
mouth” in Rome, as in all other capitals where
men's lips are sealed, must be rather too much of
an open and constant reality to be treated as a
secret and occasional ceremony.

THE PRICE OF AN M.P.
It is calculated that the expense of the next General Election will
fall very little short of Three Millions of Pounds sterling. So the
privilege of adding M.P. to their names will cost Members on an
average Four Thousand Pounds apiece. Really, people ought to bear
in mind this fact when they are trying to wade through a tedious
debate. Englishmen are ever prone to test the value of a thing by a
mere monetary standard, and orators who pay four thousand pounds
to obtain the right of speaking, must surely think it worth their while
to do their very utmost to say something worth the money. By the
bye, four thousand pounds is what they F. upon the average, and,
inasmuch as many of them º a great deal more, we think their words
should have the weight of the heavy price at which the power of utter-
ance is purchased. We would suggest that our friend DoD, in his
crect list of the Commons should specify each Member's weight—in
the gold his seat has cost him, as well as making mention of his pedi-
gree, his names, his age, and his political colours. The public thus
might learn to read with proper reverence the speeches of an orator
whom, intrinsically viewed, they might regard as a great bore, but in a
money point might class among the great guns of the House, if his
election costs j ranked him as a seven thousand pounder.
A Trifle from Pau.
SIR GEORGE Bowy ER considers that in declaring Sister PATRocINIo
and Father CLARET to be awfully pious, and utterly ignorant of poli-
tics, he has disproved the charge that they have been advisers of the
Ex-QUEEN OF SPAIN. But as IsabelLA has been awfully pious, and
has ſost her throne, our deduction from SIR GEORGE's premisses is
exactly the reverse of his.
We see an incessant advertisement, “CHURCH BEFORE PARTY.”
Qſ course., Quite right. Church in the morning, Party in the evening.
What need of such iteration?
ZAMIEL WITH A CHIGNON.
AMONG the autumn novelties in female attire is announced the
“chapeau Freischütz.” . It is made, we are told, “ of gray felt. The
crown is rather high, with a narrow brim, trimmed .."a wreath of
ostrich feathers the same shade as the hat.” To this ornament is added
“a large bow of satin or velvet ribbon, with a little bird nearly concealed
in it.” An owl peeping out of an ivy bush would seem to be the ornitho-
logical decoration most suitable to a hat in imagination associated with
Der Freischütz. If the owl were objectionable as being too big, then
perhaps a bat would be near enough to a bird to serve in the place of
one, and would be highly appropriate. Some skeletons of rats and
mice and such small deer might be added to the wreath of feathers on
the crown, so as to represent the spectral hunt which scuds athwart
the sky in the incantation scene. The apparition of a girl with her
head thus garnished, however, would º: evoke from some be-
holders, an exclamation nearly resembling that uttered by Gaspar (on
the British stage): “Ha! A wild chase in the air. A fearful omen!”
The cry which the wearer of skeletons in her “Freischütz hat” might
occasion would be more probably “A fearful woman ”

150 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[October 10, 1868."
ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS.
(CoNTINUED.)
WHEN MRs. MILLER is gone, her Headless husband has to look
about everywhere for the notes which he has been previously making
of what he is going to do to-day. He hasn't an idea where he put
them. He opens a drawer, and comes upon a collection of pocket-
books and diary-books large and small. ... --> ---,
“By Jove l’ he exclaims, all arrangements for the day going out of
his head, “fancy finding these !” He takes one after the other up,
and examines them separately. “I wish,” he says, “I’d found these
some time ago. It would be a very good plan to have a drawer regu,
larly arranged for diaries, in order, according to the years. I think I'll
begin one this year, and keep it regularly. Capital plan.” - -
§ this point I can't sayſ agree with him, not approving of diaries
generally.
“These are amusing,” he says to me, giving me diary books of
many years ago. He tells me I can look over them, if I like, while he
arranges his room, as he wants to catalogue the contents of his drawers
and his books.
I wonder how often he has commenced this same catalogue. Is
there nothing, I ask, he minds my seeing in his diaries “Not a bit,”
he returns. So I commence.
No, he has no secrets; schemes he may have had in embryo ; hints
of designs never worked out; plans for the day, forgotten before the
hour in which they were written down was over; memoranda of visits
to be made, of letters to be answered, of things to be done, remaining
memoranda to the end. Arrangements to go to different places at
different times, dates fixed, trains settled, expenses calculated, and an
entry in a diary some time after showing that all these had been forgot-
ten as soon as made. His biographer using these note-books would
not have to write the Life of the Headless Man as it actually was, but as
it might have been. The Headless Man's ink is bottled off (as it were)
for his own private use from the waters of Lethe.
There are, as will be seen by the diaries, certain points of resemblance
between the Man without a Head on his Shoulders, and a Procrasti-
nating Man. But the two must not be confused. The Procrastinator
has a head on his shoulders, and generally possesses a memory which
is to him in the place of a conscience. The Headless Man is necessarily
§ effect a Procrastinator, but a Procrastinator need not be a Headless
all.
A Procrastinator has probably a stubborn will; a Headless Man has
a weak will. The former is the donkey who won't go, and it is a
question whether walloping or blandishment is the better calculated for
making him stir. The latter is the young retriever with your string to
his collar. He may feel inclined to turn aside to salute a friend, or
challenge a stranger of his own breed, or to dash at a cat in a London
area, a rabbit or the sheep during your country walk, but chuck the
cord towards you, and he sacrifices his impulse to make your will his.
So, my friends, deal with a Headless Man. If you want him to do
something manifestly for his own good or yours, make him do it there
and then. Take him off, turn not to the right or left, take him to the
Bank or Insurance Office, or the Doctor's, or the Dentist's, or the Solici-
tor’s, or to see the elderly relatives upon whom his independence depends,
and don't let him swerve from his course. This is my conclusion as to
the treatment of the sort of patient; it will be, if it is not already,
yours, when you have glanced at MILLER's notes, mems, and diaries.
For instance, in looking over, at hap-hazard, pocket-books and diaries,
the one explaining the other, I find this entry perpetually occurring
between the years 1855 and 1861:—
“Mor. 19. Must, call on Aunt SARAH to-day. Most important, as
my father told me I am her favourite nephew.”
Then in another book.
“Nov. 21. Must keep memoranda of what I am going to do. In town
to-day; must call on Aunt SARAH. Important.”
The former pocket-book, was evidently found again by MILLER in
1857, having been mislaid for a whole year.
“Jan. 1. Begin a new year in an old pocket-book. This will save
buying a new one, as I can turn it upside down.” [Turn it upside down /
here,the Headless Man unwittingly sketches himself with a master-
stroke..] “To-day I really must call on Aunt SARAH ; I haven’t seen
º for, an age. To write also and accept MERKs's invitation. See
liza.'
ELIZA, 1.find, referred to a young lady who at that time was to have
been Mrs. Miſſiºn. By the way there is nothing of heartlessness in a
Headless man, although he may get the credit for it, and his conduct in
some cases may apparently justify the suspicion.
* cº-
tº “April, 1857. Tried to explain to ELIZA why I hadn’t been able to
meet her in the Park. I didn’t remember it till too late. I told her
how I only thought of it just as I was starting to call on Aunt SARAH,
and immediately gave up Aunt SARAH for her. By the way, must call
on Aunt SARAH to-morrow. I forget when I went last, but I think it
must have been two years ago. Dined with my father this, evening,
who was remarkably º about it. . I like her very much, but don't
care about calling, merely for the sake of what I shall get. Must call,
though. Will to-morrow. Make arrangements for to-morrow. Say:
1st. Get up in the morning. 2nd. Breakfast. 3rd. Write letters, one
to ELIZA. 4th, Go and call on Aunt SARAH. 5th. Call at my father's,
and tell him I’ve been to Aunt SARAH's : he'll be pleased. , 6th. Ride
or do something : billiards, perhaps. Dinner, &c. Capital plan keeping
a diary; will do it regularly.”
This carefully arranged plan was evidently mislaid with note book;
or certainly not adhered to, as there are no more entries in that pocket
book for that year, (the other pages being mostly blank, or taken up
with calculations (generally wrong), in pounds, shillings and, pence,
hº vaguely “expenses; ”) and in another small metallic one
find—
- “April, 1857. Mustn't get out of the way of keeping a diary. Begin
it fairly now. -
“Say, to-morrow. 1st. Get up..., 2nd. Breakfast. 3rd (leave this
open). After this, go out and call on Aunt SARAH. Must do this :
have put it off for so long. Letter from ELIZA to-day: don't under-
stand it.”
| | next entry in the Book, which I find by merely turning over the
eat, is—
“July, 1859. Just returned home.” . [Two years after the above
entry, you see..] “Delicious trip ! Dear ANNIE She is still at Geneva.
I must see my father about it at once. Found cards waiting for me from
MR. and MRs. PLYNN. I’m glad of that. She said, in her letter to
me when the match was broken off, she could never smile again.
suppose she smiles at PLYNN. Poor Eliza' , I dare say it's better
as it is. Aunt SARAH, I hear, is at Dover for her health. I wish I’d
known it: I might have called on her, as I came back that way. Must
do so when she returns to town.”
ANNIE, it turns out, is not the present MRs. MILLER. MILLER
laughs as I recall the name: he has got his coat off, and is arranging
old newspapers. “Yes,” he says, pausing for a minute, “I plunged
into that affair rather recklessly. I was sorry for it when I got back
to England. So was she, I suppose, because it came to an end very
easily, and I think—I forget what became of her: I think some one
told me something about her going to Turkey with a Consul, or a
dragoon; but I forget.”
1 pick up another pocket-book: the first mem I come across is:–
“Feb. 1860. Thursday. Must call on Aunt SARAH to-day.”
In another pocket-book:—
“ 1861. My father very angry. Says I ought to have been more atten-
tive to Aunt SARAH while she was alive. Everything to my cousins.”
This is how MILLER lost some extra hundreds a year, if not more.
Mixed up with these are random writings, sometimes across the page
lengthways, sometimes breadthways, sometimes from one corner to
another. There are extracts from books, proverbs, poetry, good stories
he has heard, riddles, appointments, addresses in alphabetical order up
tol E, and then in any sort of disorder.
uncheon-bell rings, and I descend. He will, he says, be with us in
a second. Being sent for twice, he appears an hour afterwards, and
says he has been re-arranging his room, and that now he can find any
book even in the dark. Wishing to refer in the evening to MILTON's
Paradise Lost, he offers to get it without a candle. Listening on the
stairs we hear him groping about, and coming in contact with the
table, then kicking his boots, then stumbling over the waste-paper
basket, then a heavy fall as of an inkstand or paper-weight, then other
falls, as of smaller articles from a height, then the tumbling of a heavy
metal candlestick, by which it is clear he is at the mantel-piece fumbling
for the lucifer-box, and finally his bell rings violently, and then, before
the servant can answer it, his voice is heard asking for the matches.
To write more of the Man without a ſlead on his Shoulders would be
to give the life and adventures of my friend Joseph Miller, the
Headless Man, which is not within the scope of these papers. In all
matters of real importance I found M Rs. MILLER at his elbow as his
guardian-angel. Had he been married to this excellent lady during
the lifetime of Aunt SARAH, Joseph would neither have lost a little
fortune, nor incurred his father's anger by his Headlessness.
The best course for the true friends of a Headless Man to pursue, is
to pick out a sensible woman and marry him to her. Then there is some
chance of his doing good in his generation; otherwise he is a boat
without a steerer, the rudder !"; turned this way and that by every
varying current of wind or water. Put the Pilot in #. on board,
and a prosperous voyage to the Headless. Man.
V The next specimen of the Odd Men Out I find is the Man with a
Olce.
WHEN is a candle likely to be enraged You say when it is put out.
I should say rather when it’s lighted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH's HANDBOOK FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
THE ISLE OF WIGHT.
IN the spring a young man's fancy
Lightly turns to thoughts of NANCY,
In the summer and the autumn he in Touring doth delight.
Whilst prosaic facts inditing,
- Rhymes will run into our writing,
For the spirit of the poet permeates the Isle f Wight.
For mighty ALFRED TENNYson
Lives at this island when he's on
A Poem that shall thrill us with its music and its power.
Alone that theme we’d better let,
Nor that this is a guide forget—
The flys at Ryde and Ventnor are a half-a-crown an hour.
The island’s early history
Is not involved in mystery,
For WESPASIAN, under CLAUDI Us, swooped upon it “like a bird,”
And compelled the wretched folk to
Bend their necks the Roman yoke to,
Although they fought with forti-tude. A.D. the forty-third.
Then CYNRic, CERDIc, two men,
Without compunction slew men,
And left the place to relatives, one WIGHTGAR and one STUF ;
But names Just at this time about
Get dullicult to rhyme about,
Of dates and archaeology a trifle is enough.
Then the island was invaded,
And the people speared and bladed
By French, and by one TosTIG, and those dreadful chaps the Danes;
Till Earl Warwick (HENRY BEAUchAMP)
Was set over 'em to teach 'em,
As you can read in FROUDE and BEDE some morning when it rains.
But enough of musty chronicles,
And partles in canonicals,
And warriors and sieges, revolutionary rows;
For discoursing on the present
Seems to us so much more pleasant, -
The chief town in the Isle of Wight decidedly is—
Cowes.—This is the best port in the island (except some they have at,
we are afraid to say how much a bottle, at the Pier Hotel, Ryde) and is
the Station of the Royal Yacht Squadron, many of whose vessels may be
seen—as a Cockney gentleman once observed in our hearing—“in the
yarbour during the yot weather.” Members of the Royal Yacht Club
occupy West Cowes Castle, and under their auspices a Regatta takes
place every August, when a plate (not to be confounded with the River
Plate, mind) is sailed for, and people watch the boats go out and come
in again with an amount of excitement that at times rises to fever heat.
For our part we consider that, of all the dull and depressing ways of
getting through a day, watching a Regatta is—well, everyone has his
opinion, and Punch's opinion is that a Regatta is a delusion and a snare.
The e in Cowes is a modern innovation. East Cow and West Cow
were the original names of the vaccine twins. There is a pleasant
parade to walk on, and the Green which was presented to the town by
MR. STEPHENSON for recreation, to which the inhabitants are so given,
stretches to the So-lent. If you wish to thoroughly appreciate Cowes
you must purchase ayacht, we believe, of not less than several tons, and if
admitted a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron Club you will be
privileged to carry the St. George's ensign, and you will be admitted
into foreign ports free of dues. Think over it.
Osborne.—This charming Royal residence is situated close to Norris
Castle, which is not very lar trom Slatwoods, where DR. ARNOLD, of
Rugby was born (the family came, we believe, from Whippingham–
good place for a schoolmaster to hail from), and is rather near to East
Cowes Castle. The general public are never admitted to Osborne
House ; an exception is, of course, made in favour of Punch, who is
taken in there weekly. Five miles from Cowes is
= Newport.—A funny little place, which was completely destroyed by the
French in 1377, and was even in the time of ELIZABETH described by
her Commissioners as “not yet fullie builded.” It has been represented
in Parliament by LORD EAULKLAND, the DUKE OF WELLINGTON, and
LoRD PALMERSTON : so that, like a finely-formed person, it has every
reason to be proud of its members. Within a mile of Newport is
Carisbrook Castle.—The entrance is through a famous oldgateway,which
was erected by LoRD SCALEs (not as might be imagined one of the
Finny tribe-another family altogether), and having passed it you come
to that portion of the Castle wherein CHARLES THE FIRST was placed
under tue guardianship of Colon EL HAMMOND, and from whence he
endeavoured to escape. But the aperture was too small, and though he
got through half he could not quite get through the hole, and he re-
mained in an uncomfortable position a considerable time, being quite
out of breath and half out of window. This coming to the ears of
CRow well, he was removed to another apartment, from which he
determined to make another effort for liberty, selecting Co.LONEL TITUs
as an accomplice, which was certainly an unfortunate, cognomen for a
confederate, considering the King had been wedged in the window of
his previous room. But the plot got out, though the King didn't, and
the indignant guardian who had not favoured the Monarch, with many
delicacies now gave his royal prisoner a taste of his Hammond Tongue.
Here it was the CountEss of PortLAND came forward and told the
assailants that she would herself fire a cannon at them, unless they
went away, which has always struck us as having been somewhat
absurd, as in case of a cannon being fired, the sex of the party who
applies the brand would scarcely affect the destructive power of the
projectile. We know nothing of gunnery, but that is our opinion.
However, the Mayor of Newport retired from the siege, and the
Countess may be said to have resembled money—she made the Mayor
to go. .There is here a remarkably deep well, said to be sunk nearly
three hundred feet. Don't tall down it often; it is a great waste of time,
and you have so much to see in the island.
Ryde.—Which was anciently called Rye, La Riche or La Rye, and
the fact of the French burning it down in the reign of RICHARD THE
SECOND (curious thing, you say, for it to be burnt during a reign : thank
you, but unsuited to our columns) put the inhabitants to some little
inconvenience – not to say annoyance. In fact, the town was set
alight, and the inhabitants put out simultaneously, a remarkable his-
torical phenomenon which has hitherto apparently escaped the notice
of the chroniclers. After this it was ordered that “a watch should be
kept for the security of the island.”. The town has since thriven, and
Indeed now almost every grown-up inhabitant has a watch himself.
Here the Victoria Yacht Club has its club-house, and of course, a
Regatta. The town has one too for the boatmen's benefit. We have
already expressed our sentiments regarding Regattas–the subject is a
paintul one, and if you don't mind, we’ll drop it. Ryde is decidedly a
Jolly place, it contains capital hotels, and every variety of lodging, from
the economical two pair back, with an unlimited view of over the way,
to magnificent first floors, with a splendid blue look out upon the
ocean. The neighbourhood is rich in attractions, and you will be all
the better if you depend upon your legs rather than the fly drivers; for
remember that exercise is half the battle, and that you really go to walk
when you go to Ryde. A capital route is through Brading, an old-
fashioned place at the foot of the chalk downs of Nunwell. Chalk
Down the name on your mental slate, and don't forget it, for it's worth
seeing, as is Bembridge, most interesting to the , botanist, if you
happen to be a botanist; if not, it hits the taste of the geologist; of
course you’re a geologist : Neither one or the other! No Well
then, it’s a very good place to stay and have a glass of ale at. Will
that suit you ? It was somewhere near here that LEGH WILSON wrote
The Negro Serrant, probably after a visit to Black Gang Chine. Presently
you will arrive at
Sandown.—A rising place, originally brought into notice by the
writer of the North Briton. In fact, whilst it owes much of its popu-
larity to lobsters, it is also largely indebted to W Ilkes. Here he
occupied what he termed his “Villakin.” No trace now remains of it,
or indeed of Dinah. You can walk from here by the edge of the cliff to
Shanklin.—Which can be confidently recommended as possessing
delightfully hard sands, when the tide is out, as exhibiting a remarkable
chine, and as being an excellent rhyme to FRANKLIN. Passing on you
get a fine view of Sandown Bay, Culver Cliffs, and the strange pro-
montory termed Dunnose. Should you ask what this is called, and the
answer should be “dun' know, Sir,” you must not be surprised.
Bonchurch is a beautilul place, and the visitor should climb to St.
Bonulace Down, the highest ground in the Island. We should have
thought St. Boulface Up would have been more appropriate, but this
by the way. By continuing your walk at the edge of the down (don't
step over, it is 783 feet above the level of the sea, and it might shake
you a good deal) you will come to
Wentnor.—Which is just twelve miles from Ryde. SIR JAMEs
CLARKE was its inventnor—we mean inventor, for he wrote about it
in such a laudatory manner that it speedily became the favoured resort
of those who require a particularly mild retreat for the winter. Ac-
cording to the Registrar-General's report, Ventnor is the healthiest
spot in England. Nobody is ever taken ill there. There is an instance
on record of an inhabitant having a slight headache, but we believe
it was accounted for by natural causes. Much excitement prevailed
here a few years back from a report that a cottager's child exhibited
symptoms of a cold in its head, but on inquiry it was found to be
without foundation.
The visitor must by no means miss the wonderful pair of bays,
Scratchell and Alum : he must not fail to visit Yarmouth and Fresh-
water, Gore Cliff, Niton, Chale, and St. Lawrence; and, above all
things, he must make a point of keeping his eye on the Needles.

ZADKIEL THE SAME AS EVER
ZADKIEL is right as usual. His Voice of the Stars—October, 1868,
announces that:—
“QUEEN IsABELLA, of Spain, will have Mars on the place of the Moon at
her birthday, which excites her to strange acts of violence, and I fear that
bloodshed is again seen in that hapless land. The position of Mars on the
...) of that Queen is in square to the Sun, very evil for the peace of her
realm.”
Qn the 30th of September QUEEN IsABELLA, of Spain, was deposed,
and left St. Sebastian for Pau. She committed acts of violence in
October as punctually as THEoDoRE fell in August. Before October
she had ceased to be 'QUEEN of SPAIN. What then? Of course she
only anticipated her fate, predicted clearly by ZADKIEL.
Read On, Mr. Dean.
We applaud the ingenuity of the DEAN of CoRK in selecting for the
text of his sermon in behalf of the Irish Church, the verse about a
certain crew beckoning to their partners in the other ship to come and
help them. But may we be allowed to remember that their distress
arose from having a vast quantity of fishes, of which they would make
no use, and which threatened to sink them, and that “the other ship”
got into distress by helping. Some texts are double-edged.

law, physic, or divinity. My insight into character is, consequently,
at once extensive, accurate, and profound. I can therefore speak with
authority upon many points which common Parliamentary people
should approach with, hesitation and distrust. Our noble PREMIER,
however, is an Individual (if I may be permitted such an expression)
who is gifted with a wonderful species of clairvoyance (so to speak).
His penetrating vision can see into a blockhead, and trace the work-

go further, and say without fear of contradiction, that he can see into
the middle of next November, when I apprehend the forthcomin
elections will transpire. He predicates that Constitutionalism wi
then achieve its most signal triumph, its Champions being men with
chuckle-heads and beefy hands (so to speak). He owns, does our
noble PREMIER, that he has but little faith in education and refine-
ment. He ooh-poohs them (so to speak), and he is right in so doing.
I shampoo them; and, although myself necessarily a man of (perhaps)
over-refinement and education, I know by observation, as a Perfumer
of twenty years' standing, that excess, of those things does lead in

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
is a long time since Theatrical
attraction been strong
enough to induce me to
spend a few Evenings from
ome (m º home at
Stowe-in-the-Hole, in a land
where no water is), as was
my wont when there was
anything worth seeing; but
the King o' Scots has done it.
The appearance of MR.
PHELPs, “last of a noble
line” (i think I’m †.
from a newspaper criticism),
tickled me under the gills.
Pictures of Old London, by

adaptation of SIR WALTER’s

Marry come up!” and I came º I will give you my Postscript first,
showing how gratified I was with the entertainment, and then in mine
ancient fashion will give you the stage drama, mixed with the auditorium
drama, which somewhat distracted my attention.
As to the play, let me observe that MR. HALLIDAY has satisfac-
torily executed a difficult task; difficult because of the front scenes,
required, not so much to give time for MR. BEVERLEY’s “sets,” as for
MR. PHELPs's change first from King Jamie to Trapbois, the Miser, and
then back again from Trapbois, the #. to Jamie the King.
MR. PHELPs is admirable in King James; in fact, wherever there is
comedy, there MR. PHELPs is admirable. Miser Trapbois he represents
so naturally, as to be*. repulsive; which I mean as a compli-
ment. And next to MR. PHELPs is Miss FANNY ADDIson, who plays
a singularly unsympathetic part, in a necessarily painful and unplea-
sant scene, most artistically. There cannot be, I should say, a more
difficult rôle for a young woman to undertake than that of the hard-
grained Martha Trapbois; and, if ever, artiste deserved recall, that
artiste is Miss FANNY ADDIsox. For the scenes, the two great ones
are Fleet Street and Old London Bridge; the former being, in this,
MR. BEVERLEY’s chef d’aeuvre. But, MR. BEVERLEY, why will you not
et rid of those unsightly old sky-borders *. They imperil your London

a hand in the disposition of the colours of the costumes in which
costumes, by the way, there is nothing, I think, peculiarly charac-
teristic of person or period.
Permit me, MR. F. B. CHATTERTON, to congratulate you on your
first venture this season, and to hope that this will go so well as to
defer for some considerable time (for your sake, Sir) the production of
The Cat with Nine Lives, from Les Misérables, or some such title, which
is, I notice, already underlined in your attractive playbill.

I was in the midst of a great battle, with the Revising Barristers and RICHARD-

at one of Dick ENs's Readings on Bosworth Field, when a crooked-back gamekeeper

SCARLATINA ANGLICANA.
WITH reference to the Ritualistic yagaries practised at St. James's
Chapel, Brighton, a Correspondent of the Times under the signature of
“TESTIs,” says:–
“SIR,--I find, on inquiry, that it was on account of his feeling ill at the
moment that MR. PunchAs sat in pronouncing the absolution on Sunday
morning. But it is scarcely honest in him to plead illness for his other omis-
sions in the service, as I am told by a member of St. James's that these
omissions are customary and not exceptional.”
The Reverend Gentleman, however, is not shamming for all that.
Together with his associates in ceremonial extravagance, he is sadly
afflicted with Scarlet Fever, attended, apparently, with delirium.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. JOHN THOMAS UPON THINGS IN. GENERAL,
DEAR CHAwLEs, º -
As you have gone abroad perhaps it may emuse
Hif I devote a hour or so to telling you the news:. . .
For law them forrin newspapers theres reelly nothing in em,
Exceptinck of the Fulltongs as in general begin em;
Tho any English editor hed deem it a disgrace
If a novel were hintruded in his Valuable Space.
But to matters more important-Hevery footman ort to know
That to give small fees to suvnts is in High life voted Low;
Yet some mean and stingy fellers have been writing to the Times
(A jurnal whose apinions with my own they mostly chimes),
And ses they we Bloated Flunkies are well paid to do our work,
So fees should be forbid to us, as wine is to a Turk.
For ses they when out a visiting its hard lines on a swell
To have to pay a Fiver for our answering the bell.
Well, as to getting fivers that them Gamekeepers may do,
But its seldom as a fivers tipped to such as me and U.
Nor it isnt only swells as gives the most they can aford,
For youll often find a Mister pay more libral than a Lord:
And although to get a fiver every footman he is willing,
lve known him in some cases condescend to take a shiling !
But surely gents a visitting a trifle ort to pay,
When they gets wet thro in Unting or come late ome from the Play,
What with cutting them their Sangwiches or cleaning of their cloes
The hextry work they give us we pore Suvvnts only knows.
And Im sure theres not a Phootman now in England or in Wales
As would bear the Hills of service if it wasn't for the Wails!
Theres not much news a stirring now as nobodys in town,
Excepting as the QUEEN OF SPAIN have been and lost her Crown.
So now she has to de her edd by living out of sight, ...
And the only comfort Left her is to feel it serves her Right.
And altho with Revolution all her subjex maynt agree
Some change for their bad sovereign they must be glad to see.
You dont care much for Polly tix, else doubtless youd be busy
In betting whos to win the game BILL GLADston E or BEN Dizzy.
BEN hes for Hirish Church and State which BILL he hopes to sever, ,
For he wants to see them Paddies as contented as they're clever.
BEN Dizzy hes a downy Card and plays the parsons game,
For he knows that thro the country thºyll set all the Squires in flame:
And spite of Hax of Parliament this Lection time I fear,
Therell be a lot of Bribery which to voters it means Beer.
Still I hope the side of Justice it will in the end prevail,
Lay th Irish Church low on its Bier in spite high tories Ale.
But speakin of church subjex, whod have thought of our SUSANNER
A walking in purcession and a bearing of a banner!
I dont wish to be ard on her, for ladies well I know
Is lible in religion to be smitten with mere show,
And mummeries and flummeries are likely to impose,
For people who like Incence are led easy by the Nose'
I like to hear good singing and good sermons too no less,
But I doubt if a fine preacher need to put on a fine dress:
And all them gorgeous vestments and them crucifers and copes
They ain’t .. parsons but for Papishes and Popes.
While as for Arvest Festivals which now is all the go,
To me a church it aint the place to hold a Flower Show:
And when it comes to carryin of a Pigs Head thro a town,
Tis a going of the whole hog as in England won’t go down lº
Theres other news of hintrest that Im sorry not to tell,
But missus for five minutes sheve been ringing of her bell,
Which if it isnt ansered soon shell make me cry Peccavy,
And so no more at present from John THoMMAs of Belgravy.

THE CRITERION OF FEMALE SUFFRAGE.
MR. Pººl, l h babl h
N several papers you have probably seen a paragraph statin
that at the Sittingbourne Revision Č. on Monday last "... §
J. D. CHAMBERs, Revising Barrister, allowed the names of forty-eight
females to be retained on the list of persons entitled to vote for East
Kent, in addition to thirty-three who had been previously allowed for
Ashford. A part, therefore, in the next election for East Kent, the
Court of Common Pleas not forbidding, will be taken by eighty-one
free and independent electresses.
Sir, the question of women's intellectual fitness to vote is not to be
dismissed with shallow levity. I do not consider the argument that,
whereas most ladies are taught music there are no female composers,
conclusive as to their inferiority to men in intellect. The education
necessary to the development of high musical genius requires much
|. experience of which no woman almost can have any except an
ndian squaw. To have roamed woods and forests, to have been out
in all weathers, thunder, lightning, hail, and rain, to have seen Nature
and to have seen life, is needful in order to become a great musician.
|It is scarcely possible that we should have mistresses of music equal to
masters. But there is another point wherein women might reasonably
be expected to rival men, if their equals in capacity. The culinary art
is something quite in their way. They are actually employed in it very
generally; in by far the greater number of families. Yet how very
few of them attain to º proficiency in that art? . Where do you find a
woman presiding over the staff of any considerable kitchen P Did you
ever hear of any female filling the place of a chef: Would you not
almost as little expect to hear of such a commanding officer as you
would to hear of a female general The truth is, that cookery is a
scientific art, and women do not seem capable of the grasp of principles
which applied science demands. They make very good cookmaids;
but you must fall back upon the sterner sex for a cook.
I should like to know how Miss Beck ER gets over the difficulty
which I have above pointed out. Let me advise her, since she wants
the franchise for her division of mankind, to exhort with all the
eloquence of which she is mistress, all women to apply their minds, if
they really have minds, to the study of cookery, | substantiate their
claim to the elective franchise by demonstrating their intelligence in
the º of dishes whose excellence shall be such as to show that
the hands which concocted them were governed by a head of necessity
belonging to a rational being. She may call me, if she like,
- ELAGABALUs.
P.S. Man, you know, is a cooking animal. What Miss BecKER has
to show is that this definition is true of Man, not only as contradis-
tinguished from animals, but also from Woman.
MR. GLADSTONE ON RATS.
Not a few of those persons who entertain an aversion to ecclesiasti-
cal apes of the Haydock and Brighton breed, will have been agreeably
surprised at seeing, in the Times report of an Anti-Ritualistic meeting
at Manchester, the following remark recorded as part of a speech
delivered, ea cathedra, by MR. GLADstoNE:—
“When people had rats or thieves in their houses they set to work to get
rid of them and punish them according to law; so should Churchmen deal
with Ritualists.”
Of course, in saying that people should try to punish Ritualists
according to law, MR. GLADston E merely meant to say that they ought
to take steps to prosecute them in the Ecclesiastical Courts. It is not
for a moment to be supposed that he meant to advocate the ecution
of Ritualists. Nobody can fairly deny that he was perfectly justified
in comparing Ritualists to rats. They have undoubtedly ratted from
the principles of the Reformation; and they are busily at work bur-
rowing as fast as they are able beneath the foundation of the Church
of England, and doing all they can to undermine it. By rats MR.
GLADstoNE perhaps meant the Ritualistic clergy; and if they may pro-
perly be called Church rats, then perhaps we may call their lay dupes,
of whom there are a few, Church mice, to make a distinction between
the greater and the smaller vermin. However, the Ritualists, as a
body, will be considered by the majority of the British public to have
been very happily described as rats by MR. GLADston E.
It may be as well just to add that the chair, at the Manchester Anti-
Ritualist Conference, was filled by the MR. GLADstone who is Presi-
dent of the Manchester Diocesan Church Association. From that
chair the speech above quoted, wherein the Ritualists were called rats,
was made by MR. Robert GLADSToxE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE Good of THE “GOLDEN ROSE.”
His Holiness the Pope, only the other day, sent the “Golden Rose,”
which he is accustomed periodically to bless and confer on faithful
Sovereigns, to the QUEEN OF SPAIN. It was the reward of devotion,
if not of virtue. There are some who will remark that it appears to
have proved auspicious.
Not quite a year ago, the Naples Observer published a list of
sequences which in some nine or ten cases had ensued on the papal
benediction. They were all signally calamitous, from the time when
the Holy Father blessed Italy in 1848, just before Novara, to the last
blessing he pronounced on Austria, followed by Sadowa. The rule
seems to have been, that everybody who has been blessed by the Pope
has presently come to grief. Isa BELLA THE SEcoRD is at least no
exception to it.
The Romans regard these sequences of the Pope's benediction as
consequences. They believe him to be a gettafore, a person possessed
against, and indeed contrary to his will, of an “evil eye.” This is aii
my eye and BETTY MARTIN, you will say, of course. But it is what
those credulous people imagine, and, by the rule of post hoc propter hoc,
facts might seem to prove it. Pio Nono's blessing would appear to
have all effect ºthe reverse of that which he intends.
Of course, an “old man's blessing” can do no one any harm, and no
sensible person whom the Pope might bless would therefore expect to
be blowed. But this is worth noting by those whom it may concern;
that if his benediction does harm to nobody, it certainly, as far as we
can see, does nobody good. At any rate, the Ex-QUEEN OF SPAIN has
derived no visible advantage from the “Golden Rose,” which, elabo-
rately consecrated, blessed, and perfumed, she received at his hands.
So, then, whilst the notion that any amulet or charm of that kind
might bring ill luck, is superstitious, the idea that any good could come
of it, is unfounded.
If, indeed, the Pope were, as his subjects think, a gettatore, instead
of having excommunicated Victor-EMMANUEL he could have given
the KING OF ITALY his apostolical benediction, which would have in-
fallibly done for him and his kingdom.
PENCRAFT AND PRIESTCRAFT.
At a meeting of the Irish Church Congress, the other day, ARCH-
DEAcos LEE, of Dublin, read a paper on “The Church and the
Periodical Literature of the *. wherein he paid the public a
compliment. The purpose of the Wenerable Archdeacon’s lecture was
to urge the necessity of requiring that every article published in any
newspaper or other periodical should be signed by its writer. He
argued that articles often derive undue weight from the mere character
of the paper in which they appear. This is as much as to say that the
public are accustomed to pay that attention to an article which they
[. to be written by a celebrity that they would withhold if they
new that its author was a man of no mark. What a truly discerning
public the public would be if it were capable of letting its judgment be
ruled by such a consideration as that ' There are people whose intel-
lects do not enable them to recognise excellence apart from “prestige,”
who can appreciate a good thing if they hear it said or see it written
by somebody famous—otherwise not. But the public is not a mass of
such boobies as those. If it were, then, certainly, the adoption of
ARCHDEACON LEE's proposal, that all, newspaper and other such
articles should have to be signed, would be very advantageous for
those exponents of the clerical and evasive mind who wish eve
sº or assertion they object to but cannot answer, to be ignored.
“Who is BRowN ?” That question would then constitute a short
way of dealing with the irrefragable but obscure BRowN. Ecclesiastical
and academical handles and spouts to names would then, too, have all
the influence which they ought to have for the purpose of divines more
. for the maintenance of opinions than for the investigation
Of truth. w
The system of obliging writers to sign their articles would also to
some extent have the advantage of rendering them punishable by the
infliction, if expedient, of those social penalties which dogmatists have
still a considerable power of invoking. But the public is not what
MR. BUMBLE said the Law was, and what ARCHDEAcon LEE appears
to think JoHN BULL; widelicet, an ass.

THE LIBERTY OF COUNSEL.
THE freedom of forensic speech is in danger. LoRD RANELAgh
has addressed a letter to the South Middlesex Volunteers, denying, on
his honour, that he had ever visited “Beautiful for Ever's" shop from
any other motive than idle curiosity. It is but just that the noble
lord's vindication of his fair fame should be accepted. MR. Knox, at
Marlborough Street, when first “Beautiful for Ever” was had up,
stated that the name of LoRD RANELAGH had been most improperly
imported into the case touching that person. No doubt the suspicion
which his Lordship incurred by not having carefully enough observed
the copybook precept, “Avoid Bad Company,” was groundless. Even
if he had given any apparent ground for it, nobody would have, or have
had, any right to insinuate that against him which could not be proved.
Nobody, that is, out of Court—out of a wig and gown. In a long robe,
however, and under cover of horsehair, unbounded liberty of insinua-
tion is the privilege of a gentleman. In the interest of that noble
institution, the Bar, therefore, every, Englishman will feel bound to
protest against the censure pronounced by LoRD RANELAGH on counsel
In saying:—
“But capital was made out of me, and the public received a bias. I would
specially refer to the unwarrantable remarks of SERJEANT BALLANTINE at the
Old Bailey, who, without a tittle of evidence to justify it, had the audacity to
imply improper motives to me in my going into MADAME RAchel's shop.’
What! Find fault with any aspersion, true or false, founded or
unfounded, which a barrister, in pleading his cause, may think fit to
cast on the character of a nobleman, or any other manº Suggest that
calumny in the way of advocacy ought no more to be allowed than it is
in any other way? Oh! Then there would be an end of everything
that we have always been accustomed to... No restraint upon the
barrister's tongue! At least let him be at liberty, in his vocation, to
abuse everybody that he may choose, except, of course, our Sovereign
Lady the QUEEN and my Lord Judge. But then, a word for the Press.
Let every public writer be likewise at liberty to defame all and sundry,
on condition only that he shall have duly received his fee, and been
paid for doing so.
“INSPECT YOUR SILVER FORKS AND SPQONS.”
DEAR PUNCH, - - - - - - -
THE above advice is given by a writer in the Times. To him
I reply, like the war-horse, “Aha!” or rather “Ha, ha!”
I should like to see myself doing it. I mean that I should not. ..
Do you, or does the writer in question, at least there’s no question,
but I mean the writer in the Times, think
1. That I would lock up my capital all my life in inconvertible
metallics? -
. That I would tempt my servants to establish relations with a
marine-store thief?
. That I would live in such dread of burglars as to be unhappy if
my Fº were not under my bed all night? -
That I would have spoons and forks which I shouldn't like to
lend to my friends when they give big parties?
. That I would aid to restrict a circulating medium ?
. That I would prevent my admirers from presenting me with the
testimonial which my virtues have long demanded, and which I
live in hopes of receiving one of these fine days.
Sir, I have no silver forks or spoons, and that’s my answer to the
unsolicited advice of the writer in the Times.
I am, Sir,
Yours obediently,

I HAVE LET THAT FELLow DREss ME As HE LIKEs For The LAST THREE YEARs, AND Now HE HAs
ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITH A WOICE.
Of this genus there are two species, as there were of the Man with
ar.
The first is the Man with a voice pure and simple, not necessarily to
be qualified as a tenor, baritone, or bass voice, or even as a musi
voice, but simply as A Voice. -
I select Tufton as an excellent specimen. I catch him alive, and pin
him on to the board for your inspection. , No one requires to see this
species to be certain of his presence in the house: you will say, instinc-
tively, “I know TUPTON's here : I heard his voice.”
He is a sort of Invisible Prince in a household. You may recollect
that young LEANDER (which was the Invisible Prince's name, I think)
used to be heard and not seen, and his voice would be constantly sayin
all kinds of pretty things to the Princess, and ugly things to the wicke
somebody ". and no one, for the life of them, could tell whence the
sound came. So with John Tupton, the Man with a Voice. (Of the
second species I will not now speak: suffice it, that it is necessarily
musical, but not necessarily powerful.)
The Man with a Voice possesses little, if any, power of modulation.
His voice may be marked on a sono-meter, as never standing at lower
than Loud, and rising by tonic degrees up to Bawling point. TUPTON
is somewhat above the average English height, but is not to be spoken
of as a man. Some people would call i. stout: some wouldn't:
say, comfortable. He has a mode of his own for dress, which, by some
appy instinct, is never strikingly fashionable, nor strikingly out of the
fashion. You would say, after some consideration, that he is well.
dressed. He is neither handsome nor ugly, so, in short, you would
pass TUPton in a crowd as you would have the Invisible Prince, if it
wasn't for his Voice. That arrestsº you can’t help it. You'll
turn and ask who he is. There is only one way of expressing in print
the loudness of TUPton’s voice, and that is by such a judicious use
of Capitals, as the Irishman employed in his letter to his deaf mother.
After this preparation, enter Tupton. -
I am walking during the season in the Park, and talking to a loyely
}. lady, to whom I have been introduced the night before at MRs.
ILLIps's At Home. The lovely young lady speaks with the slightest
suspicion of a French accent, with the most º touches of
French manner, and is ignorant, [why should I bother her with my
domestic circumstances? and my wife couldn’t go to MRs. FILLIps's,
cal no matter why—she couldn't],-she is ignorant, I say, of my status in
society as a married man.
The conversation has stopped at some interesting point just for a
second, while she selects a seat and I search for twopence. It is
impossible, I admit, for any casual observer to see that the lovely
young lady and myself are together. She is sitting down; I am
standing up, with my gloved-hand wedged in my trouser-pocket, strug-
#: with twopence, and my hand, having gone in open, makes some
fficulty about coming out again as a fist. Anyone who would not
have addressed me when with a lovely young lady (unless he was a
designing scoundrel who only did it for the sake of an introduction,
and ultimately cutting me out; I hate such guile, but that is not to
the point here) may certainly do so now. I am addressed; loudly.
“Hallo!” shouts a Voice, as if I were miles off
“Hallo! Old Boy!” it repeats, and here is Tupton. - -
I say how d'ye do to him, and remark, for the sake of diverting his
attention from the lovely young lady, between whom and Tupton I
carefully place myself, that it is so difficult to find coppers when you
want them.
-- pers!” shout TUPTon’s voice. “Here you are. How many?”
People attracted by this confounded Voice turn to see how many
coppers I am in want of; people passing slowly in their carriages lean
out, and languidly draw one another's attention to the Voice, and the
two people engaged in the copper transaction. I feel for the lovely
young lady, it must be º annoying to her. She cuts herself of
from me by a tilt of her little parasol, 3. her ear is not brotected from
the Voice.
I am about to explain to TUPton that I am with a lady, preparatory

to sitting down, and continuing that pleasant flirtation gossip, which
the chair has interrupted, when TUPToN says, in a voice which seems
to me louder than usual, -
“And how’s the Missus? Hey?” -
It’s his jocular way of mentioning any friend's wife, instead of giving
her name and title fairly and plainly. - -
Loungers turn and smile. A quick side glance shows me a slight
movement of my lovely young lady's parasol. She evidently considers
herself deceived, and doesn't º: it. TUPTON must be answered
quickly, and dismissed.
“Oh, she’s very well,” I answer, “at least,” correcting myself, for
when I do speak, it must be the whole truth, though one does consent
now and then to a suppressio, “she’s getting on very well, indeed. I
hope,” I add by way of choking him off, and getting to my seat by the
lovely young lady before any further mischief is done, “when she is
well again you’ll come and see us.” And here I extend my hand.
“Thank yel’ he returns, and taking my hand, holds it affectionately.
together are at a standstill.
One shake of the hand, and I shall be clear of TUPTON. He gives
the whole Park, confound him ')
“Remember me to your wife. Glad she's getting on so well.” I
nod and smile, “Saw it in the paper: usual column.” Everybody is
listening now : I am thinking how I should like to jump at him and
ut a plaster on his mouth, like Bunkº and Hºnºused to do, when
ſº out as he half turns to go, “It was Twins? eh?”
I can’t restrain myself: I shout in reply, “ No.”
I must calm myself. Fools are laughing and whispering about me.
They don’t (as it seems to me) laugh at Tupton. No : he escapes;
they laugh at Twins. And why? Why should they laugh at Twins?
I don’t. His Voice has made me the butt of the whole Park. I turn
to the lovely young lady: Twins have settled it; she is ing to
Some else. Serve me right: what business have I—

They don't go out much, and TUPTON does, so they depend upon him

precious loud reports they are.

Oak trees mostly do abound;
And I sid, wi' lamentation,

Hogs, if hungry be their mood,
Can but grunt for want o' diet.
What a sinful waste o' food |
Herds o' swine, that Park all over,
Ought to be turned in to roam,
For to live like 'twere in clover,
In the Forest as at whoam.

Not unless pigs' lives is taken
'Fore their eddication’s done.
With high art I be acquainted;
For my likenus once I sat,
And Izee a sign-board painted:
Just likewise a pig you fat.
Paint a pictur, then you lays un

Last of all you takes and glaze un,
That’s the way as I took note.
So wi' pigs: you gives 'um taters

Those who do not favour

somewhat of a shock in
examining the annals of
Clifton. Two remarkable
dreams are inseparably as-
sociated with its history.
The first was dreamt by one
WILLIAM GAgg, a broker
(broken slumbers, you ob-
serve—much obliged), who,
in 1680, dreamt that he
drank of the Clifton water,

of the dreams. The other one o to MRs.
WATTs, wife of WILLIAM Watts. This person
was a plumber, and it is not surprising that
his wife’s mind wandered on the leads. The
metal took the form of shot, and it struck her
(a motion—not the shot) that if molten lead
were dropped into water, it would assume a
round shape, and save any quantity of expense
and labour. She must have been in a very
heavy slumber, but she woke up before, the
morning light, and telling her husband the
subject of her dream, he continued the conver-
sation by dropping the subject; and though at
first he questioned the experiment, he soon
found it answer, and sold his wife's discovery
for ten thousand pounds; so that fortune not
only came to her in her sleep, but followed in
her wake. We wish we could close the story at
this point, leaving poor WATTs with money in
lots because of his shots. Alas! he might have
made a million (he started as a º'. but
he took a mania for building, and commenced
a terrace, which turned the tables on its pro-

DONKEY DINNERS.
HoRSE dinners were all the go a few months
since, and donkey dinners, doubtless, will ere
long be in fashion, at least if we put faith in the
paragraph that follows:–
“Everybody who has eaten roast donkey has pro-
nounced it excellent. In flavour it is said to resemble
turkey, though the colouris considerably darker. The
animal in question, is a very clean feeder, cheap,
hardy, and subsists easily at little cost, and it seems
within possibility that donkeys may be reared on the
poorest commons, not only as beasts of burden for the
use of the poor, but as a luxurious addition to the
banquets of the rich.”
If I had a donkey that wouldn't go, d'ye think
I’d waste my whipcord in walloping him O
no | I’d send him to the butcher's, sure as I’m
a living sinner, and eat him nicely roasted for
my next Sunday dinner. Such may be the reso-
lution of many a London, costermonger, after
reading the above; and strict, utilitarians will
probably applaud it. As novelty is charming,
we may expect that ass-flesh i". will be
viewed as quite a º: and donkey-eaters
will be giving delightful little dinners, whereat
the menu will begin with delicious ass-tail soup,
and after a few entréeſ, such as “oreilles des
ânes farcies aux truffes,” or “cotelettes de l'ane
jeune à la financière,” the banquet will conclude
with a juicy haunch of donkey, to which no
haunch of venison will be deemed worthy to
compare. We might suggest, by way of entre-
met, a salad of fresh thistles, of which the
donkey-eaters might º riately partake.
After the repast, we may look for a few songs
in the praise of donkey-eating, in the manner of
the following :-
Here’s a health to all fat asses |
Theirs all other meat surpasses—
Let the donkey-steak go round.
He who’d have a novel pleasure,
Let him relish at his leisure
The joys that in ass-meat abound.
Fill a bumper—'tis no thumper—
In Donkey sweetest flesh is found.
A CoNFIDING PUBLIC.—The Tavern that Trusts.
THE EUPHONY OF COMMERCE.
MR. PUNCH,-SIR,
CALLING one day last week on my pickle-merchant, I was
recommended by that, Purveyor of sophistigated acids to purchase an
original sauce which had given much satisfaction to his “client,” SIR
- “Are you a solicitor?” I inquired, somewhat startled
by this strange synonym. ... “I am not admitted to be so,” blandly
replied the man of chillies, “though I am often consulted about family
Jars.
I may here observe that this citizen of Cheap, like many of our
merchant princes, occasionally tempers business with badinage. Makin
fun of the Funds, by a timely mo! he relieves the Reduced, and, wit
innocent levity, attenuates the Consolidated. He recently remarked-
when touching lightly on certain Bank insecurities—that no Stock was
such an unfailing source of interest as a laughing-Stock.
“You spoke of your, client,” said I, pointedly. “You mean, I sup-
pose, your customer?”
The Purveyor, with a forgiving smile, softly corrected me. “We
have no customers. Tradesmen have, but pickling is a profession.”
. The conference ended by my giving instructions for a bottle of cap-
sicums; which, being handed to me, I, like a model client, paid my
professional adviser his charges without wincing.
Now, Mr. Punch, I am sanguine enough to anticipate that the
refinement of language adopted in South-East Cheap ºbe frequently
imitated elsewhere. rejoice to say that we have very few Farmers
now, though we have many Agriculturists. Cotton-spinners are daily
becoming Millionnaires, and a Milliner is a Marchande des Modes from
Tyburnia to Timbuctoo. Even a Needle-maker—so I am gravely in:
formed by my maiden sister—is now a manufacturer of Penelope and
Uncotopic crochets. A Dentist of genius cannot draw a tooth without
first extracting a Greek root from his Lexicon.
All this is very nice, but some old-fashioned titles are still retained,
however inapplicable to modern circums' ºnces. A licensed, carrier of
flowers and parasols, and watcher of eyes, is frequently called } youn
ladies of good education a Lover. A laymaster-General and a Husban
are universally convertible terms. If we go to Parliament, we shall
find doomed warriors defending a beleaguered Treasury, against, a
rampant Majority, spoken of .# touching tenderness as Ministers by
an admiring little flock. - -
Here let me pause; but, before concluding, I would improve m
present opportunity, and suggest that henceforth no ornate correspond-
ent should'seek to begui e agentle Editor, and deface his Doric columns
by subscribing himself, with wilful inaccuracy,
A CoNSTANT READER.
A WORTHY MEMORIAL.
THEY who think that a Free Press is an advantage to a nation,
should subscribe to the Memorial of a man who, in his time, fought
many a brave battle for the freedom of the Press, LEIGH HUNT was
sent to prison for publishing opinions which Mr. Punch in perfect
safety may now put forth when he pleases; and the fact that Mr.
Punch can say just what he likes without a fear of Nº. is owin
in great measure to the battles LEIGH HUNT fought. Gratefully an
§. remembering this fact, Mr. Punch would say a word for the
Memorial to LEIGH HUNT, and they who would be sorry to see
Mr. Punch in Newgate (imagine the world living for a week without
its Punch (), will freely give their guineas to perpetuate the memory of
a writer who worked manfully to gain for England a Free Press.

ANOTHER KIND OF CAB-STRIKE WANTED.
IN, their late strike the cabmen made a striking fault. Instead of
striking, in a manner that but served to hit themselves, they should
have rather aimed the blow at the pockets of their masters. It mainly
is their owners' fault that cabs have a bad name, and that London is
worse off for them than most provincial towns. That there are some
ood cabs in London we are willing to admit, but where else run we
the risk of riding in a rumbling, rattling, ramshackle four-wheeler, which
possibly has just conveyed a patient to a hospital, or has carried measly
meat to the back-door of a pork-butcher That man
can be civil we allow, but where else run we the º of being bullied
by the foul-mouthed driver of a night-cab, who is dirtier in language
and appearance than a nightman.” Such black sheep taint the flock,
and are the cause why London cabmen have an evil reputation. People
clearly would use cabs far more often than they do, if they were sure of
finding civility and cleanliness. A cab is far too often a mere vehicle of
abuse, and the chance of dirt, or insult makes many a man prefer the
safer course of walking. “None but the clean deserve the fare.”
should be the golden rule with cabmen. We don't expect a cab-driver
to put on white kid gloves; or, when we give him haſ a sovereign, to
hand us our right change in a sweetly-scented envelope; but we do
expect clean cabs and civil spoken, cabmen, and if the contraries of
these, were all struck off the streets, we feel certain that the strike
would find great favour with the public.

WHALLEY IN SPAIN.
The more we read of foreign intelligence the more we are convinced
of our superiority to all other European nations in liberality, tolerance,
and common sense. Here, now, is a statement in the letter of a con-
temporary’s Special Correspondent at Barcelona:—
º “The Junta have resolved to enforce the law, which had been allowed to
fall into disuse, forbidding the residence of Jesuits in Spain. They have dis-
covered that the Society was plotting a reactionary movement, and they have
ordered the Members of it to leave the country. º, were found plotting at
Maaresa, and went at midnight last night to the Italian Consul for passports.”
By still more recent intelligence from Madrid, we are informed that
actually—
“The Minister of Justice has issued a decree suppressing the Society of the
Jesuits throughout Spain and the Spanish Islands, ordering that its colleges
and institutions be . within three days, and declaring its movable and
immovable property sequestrated to the State.”
Such is the way in which a body of harmless ecclesiastics is dealt
with by the §g. Junta. And this is the Liberal-Provisional
Government of Spain' Nor are the innocent and guileless followers
of IGNATIUS Loyola likely to be the only victims of its bigotry. It
proposes, we are told, the extinction of .# religious communities and
associations which have been established since 1835. On what ground
does it base this monstrous proposal The notion that all such
societies are “contrary to liberty,’. and that their suppression, with
“the abolition of all their privileges’’ is “a measure urgently necessary
for the safety of the State.” Now, only suppose this sort of language
had quoted as that of any man in this country, whom wo
have been concluded by the generality of instructed readers to be
MR. WHALLEy. Of course, everybody in this country but MR.WHALLEY
laughs at the idea that the poor Jesuits are in any way capable of being
mischievous, or that monastic institutions are at all inimical to liberty.

The suggestion that MR. WHALLEY himself is a Jesuit in disguise is a
mere joke; of course the Jesuits are incapable of disguise, and, at
least in enlightened England, their simplicity is known to all men,
except the Member for Peterborough.

Says the Honourable MR. Bouver IE to MR. J. S. MILL, -
“You know nothing about it, and I will be jolly well blowed if I will.
He a shining light! He's only a candle with a bad wick,
But whether he is or not, I shan’t make way for MR. CHADwick;
And your law of selection is in my mind a very bad law,
I suppose it was that made you recommend the blasphemous fellow,

A Slang Phrase.
“I’ll have your hat?” What, asks. Thoughtful THEoPHILUs of
us, is the origin of this slangism? We give him the answer. It came
rom Rome. When there was a probability of one of the Cardinals
dying, an enemy of his who was expecting to be raised to the Cardinalato
was so uncharitable as to allude to the probable event in the presence
of the fast failing dignitary in these words: “I shall have your hat.”
The phrase has travelled northwards, and here it is.

SIR,--I reside in a ºil. in a º of town, where, I
occupy an elegantly furnished bedroom, and join the ladies in an evening, in the
drawing-room with my concertina, I believe to our mutual, satisfaction. I filled
in a paper which I obtained from an obliging baker, and sent in, my claim for
the lodger franchise. ... Being a Conservative, and devotedly attached to, “Our

for the Borough of Pimlicopolis, because—you will hardly credit it—I could not
prove an uninterrupted use of the backgammon board for a period of twelyemonths,
ending the last day of July. Can there be a greater absurdity? But I have the
sympathy of Miss TILTON and all the other hi. at No. 40, who declare that if I
were to offer myself as a Member of Parliament, and they had votes, as they
ought to have, they would poll for me to a woman.

PUNCH,--I tell you I will appeal to every Court in Westminster against the
decision of a hireling lawyer dressed in a Yiğ and gown and a little brief authority
which, it is well known at our Debating Club, the “Stentorian Spouters,” he
owes entirely to the circumstance of his having an agreeable tenor voice, and occa-
sionally taking part in a glee with MR. JUSTICE JUMBLEBY’s daughters. I am an
unfurnished lodger, a radical corn-extractor, and therefore objected to by a syco-
phant of a Tory agent, and deprived of a Briton's º: cause I could not
produce my latch-key; and the Barrister, who had only been º hours,
refused to adjourn until I could go to Great Cromwell Street and fetch it. And so
after all the processions I have walked in, and the meetings I have talked in, and
the petitions I have signed, and the #. overseers, vestry-clerks, Home Secre-
taries, Statesmen, and parish beadles I have had interviews with about my right to
vote, I am still a political outcast, robbed of that which the “Spouters” have
often heard me allude to as the Pharmacopoeia for all our ills. Was there ever
such tyranny ? (I suppose next we shall be required to show that we have had
all the disorders of infancy, and are always in bed by ten o'clock, and never enter
a public house, and don't owe anybody a º But smaller causes than
this have undermined thrones before now, and brought a haughty aristocracy
down to the dust. We shall see, we shall see. As the poet says,
“And Freedom shriek'd, as Kosciusko fell.”

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I appeal to your courtesy, your chivalry, I am a single
woman, and with 77 more single and 33. widow women have been refused the
Electoral Franchise by the Revising Barrister—I will be more generous than he
was, and not disclose his name, lest he should never be able to hold up his wig
again—all of us dismissed by him, as though we had been a flock of geese, with.
out a moment’s reflection, without going back as far as HENRY THE SIXTH in the
calm retirement of his own º without refreshing his memory with the
names and deeds of those deathless females who decorate the pages of our
history, from BoADICEA to BECKER, Shame on him and his profession (always
.# those gallant gentlemen who did go back as far as HENRY THE SIXTH,
and made the Register glow with Woman's name) and his sex, who are jealous of
us, of us women, who will yet in the emancipated future soar above Acts of
Parliament, and Barristers, and Conventionalisms, and plant the oriflamme of pro-
gress on the citadel of freedom-man's equal, man's master | Until that day
dawns, I will no more register my name, but my vow to
avenge the wrongs of my trampled sex.
Yours now trodden down, but then triumphant,

P.S. Scorn on the withings who say that woman's proper
place is the fireside—the Register Stove'
MR. PUNCH,-Is there anything about kitchen fire in
the Reform Act? any allusion to the use of plate and linen
and the back parlour for breakfast on Sunday morning,
and a fixed charge for dinner on that day? any reference to
the vexed question of boot-cleaning? any mention of that
delicate point, attendance? I can find none in my edition;
and yet. I am disqualified, because, after a learned argu-
ment, an hour . a half long, by my lawyer, and a º
of equal length and learning by his opponent, and an elabº
rate judgment by the presiding Barrister, who reserved his
decision till the next morning, and then told us he had
assed the whole of the previous, evening (in the New
yalty Theatre, it was openly said in Court) searching
for a precedent in the reign of Rich ARD THE THIRD, it
was determined that as all the luxuries I have enumerated
at the beginning of this letter were charged to me as
extras, º the weekly rent for my apartment to
3s, 93d., it did not amount in the year to ten pounds, the
minimum fixed by the Act. An Act of injustice, I say.
Your obedient Servant,

MR. PungH,-I am done. ... I, the industrious, sober,
saving, studious carver and gilder, ambitious of a share
in the government of my native land, am not to have the
distinction of voting for BUN.com BE, the advanced Candidate
for Thousandstreets. I suffered an inquisitive lawyer to
extract from me the admission that to oblige MRs. PARLBy
º landlady), I turned out of my room for a few nights,
and slept in a folding bedstead in the kitchen, to accom:
modate her niece from the country; and a very nice girl
Louisa turned out to be, and we are now engaged, and
§§ to be married at Christmas. And so MR. LAwLEY
wAviTER decided that I had not occupied the same room
for twelve months uninterruptedly, and struck me of the
Register. I think there is room for improvement in these
Registration Courts. Don't you?' I offered to prove that
MRs. PARLBy had had the uninterrupted use of my tea-
caddy for twelve months or more, (Louis A knows nothing
of this) but that wouldn’t do, they said.
Yours,

SIR,--I have lost my vote entirely through the stupidity
of the Packbury overseers and the formal, mind of the
Packbury Barrister. My name, as you will observe, is
John, but I invariably sign it JNo., and so subscribed my
claim, forgetting, I admit, the servile subjugation of lawyers
to forms. The overseers omitted to alter it, and MR.
ELDoN Stowell, GLIBLEY ruled that as I had not fulfilled
the letter of the law, I must be struck off. A great blow
to me, I assure you. But he granted me, a case for
appeal. So look out for me in the papers in November.
Yours faithfully,
Napier Street, Packbury. JNo. DUGWEED.

it. Eh

CRUELTY TO BACHELORS.
| A FRENCH journal relates that, as a provocative to marriage on the
part of selfish bachelors, at a fête held at Montreuil—
. “On a décidé que le concours de tir au pistolet et à la carabine serait
rigoureusement réservé aux hommes mariés.”
A novel, method this, to drive a man to marry! ... Fancy a B.A., or
.# other British bachelor, imagining himself forced to go and get a
Wife; for the reasºn, that without one he could never shoot at Wimble-
don! ...We can't help thinking that the ladies of Montreuil would have
for the benefit of those who were denied the use of bullets. In this
case the young fellows who were not allowed to shoot, might have been
exposed to the risk of being shot at; for there is no doubt that, if
husbands are there in such demand, the bachelors at a ball would have
each become a target for some of Cupid’s arrows.

BELLS ON BEER.
OF an eve, homeward bound, from a walk rather º -
As I passed through a village, out rang the Church bells;
And they sang me the chorus, methought, of a song:
How bells sing, the old story of WhittingtoN tells.
Plain as ever were words spoke by MAG or by Poll.
Did those village Church bells resound Tol de rol iol,
Tol de rol tippledy,
Tol de rol tippledy,
Tol de rol tippledy,
Ri fol de rol.
I had nowise exceeded for some time before,
Had a perfect teetotaller been all the day,
But I meant to have one glass of beer and no more,
At a house I was going to pass on my way.
It is one of the few where you get the old stuff—
Beer of which, as a rule, half-a-pint is enough.
Tóide rol tippledy, &c.
Oh, 'tis woeful to think how deplorably few
Åre the places where good beer is still to be sold.
For most brewers have now ceased such stingo to brew
As we used to imbibe in our young days of old.
In its stead there 's your flat, heavy, ...} Burton ale,
Or a dreary dead level of bitter and pale. -
Tol de rol tippledy, &c.
When the beer-engine came in place of the tap,
From that time it was never in England good beer;
For that base machine spoils any brewed worth a rap,
'Tis increased population, the truth if you’ll hear,
Which the publican needs must draw fast to º ;
And the reason malt liquor is ruined—that’s why.
Tol de rol tippledy, &c.
What a thought that we’re sunk and degraded so low,
That, what sort of a thing decent swipes ought to be,
We have beer from Vienna sent over to show !
Who would ever have feared such debasement to see
Is the foreigner even in beer now excels:
'Twas his triumph I seemed to hear rung by Church bells.

A GOOD FRENCEI FELLOW.
THE French have a reputation, not unmerited, for saying smart
things. Their witticisms, however, analysed, for the most part resolve
themselves into utterances, offensive or defensive, of restless vanity.
But there are exceptions to this rule, and here is one of them, thanks
to the Pall Mall Gazette :-
“M. HENRI Roch EFort, in a recent number of La Lanterne, alluding to
the supposed determination of the EMPEROR to make war if the elections went
against him, asks what would be thought of a man rushing into the street and
stabbing an inoffensive person because his landlord had raised his rent.”
This is an apt and manly illustration. Its manliness is quite peculiar.
he love of approbation which, in an irritable state, is the basis of
most French wit, men have in common with animals. You may note
it exceedingly active, for instance, in the cur and the monkey. If these
creatures could speak, they would be always saying something piquant
either to flatter or to wound one another's self-conceit. In the parallel,
put as above by M. HENRI Roch EFoRT, there is evident, besides |
reason, the distinctly human faculty of conscientiousness, or the moral
sense. Welcome to a Frenchman thus saying a really, in every sense
of the word, good thing.
NO PARTY QUESTION.
“I Do not,” says the KNIGHT of KERRY, in a sensible letter to the
Times on the Irish Church, “presume to say whether M.R. DisrAELI
should have approached . GLADSTONE, or MR. GLADSTONE MR.
DisRAELI; but undoubtedly they ought to have met.” If they had,
he thinks that a measure º have been pºssed. which “must have
commanded the respect of the country.” “I believe,” concludes the
honourable gentleman, “that all that was needed on the part of the
ers for such a | consummation was the possession of two
qualities most rare indeed among eminent statesmen—common sense
and common honesty.” Just, so; and if the Leader of the Liberal
Party and the Conservative Premier had met together, there would
have been a conjunction of Common Honesty with Common Sense.
Which would have been which -

ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITH A WOICE.-SECOND SPECIES OF THE
GENUS.
THE Second Species is divided thus: 1. The Big Man with a Small
Voice; 2. The Small, Man with a Big Voice. Both are musical; the
former being, generally, a man with considerable knowledge of the art,
and a studious cultivator of the twopenn'orth of talent in his possession.
The latter also knows music, superficially, and trusts to his strong
voice to pull him through all difficulties. We will look at Number
Two first, being the noisier, and then return to the Big Man with his
pretty little voice, who will be found a pleasant companion in a drawing-
room entertainment, or “An Excellent Substitute’” (as the advertise-
ments say) for MARIo in the evening.
SILFor D-BILLY SILFORD–is my Little Man with a Big Voice.
SILFoRD's is a most convenient voice. You begin with it down-
stairs—so to speak—in the cellar, as basso, almost prºſondo (an attempt
at profondo being sufficiently uncomfortable to º his friends advise
him not to try it too much); then he mounts to the ground-floor
appearing here as a baritone; then another flight takes him into the
first-floor as a tenor, with his voice in his nose; the next step bein
a jump up into the attics, where his eyes and ears help him, bot
moving up with his voice, which seems to have forced itself violently
through his palate, and out at the top of his head.
SilroRD, therefore, is a very ... fellow in choirs and places where
they sing, and where followeth the anthem, and nothing delights him
more than being asked to take his place as a chorister in his own parish
church, or to join in a madrigal, quartette, or any other sort of fette
in a private party, or at an amateur concert. SILFoRD will sing about
the house, up-stairs and down-stairs, and in anybody’s chamber, as
much as our friend TUPTON, and as loudly; only SILFORD will be
musical. He sings snatches of tunes correctly, generally preferring
himself in well-known bass songs of a nautical or roving character;
or if he has any concert on hand, you will hear, nothing from him
but his “part,” some turn in which he generally “can’t get” till the
very day of the concert itself, when he secures the lº correctly at
the morning rehearsal, practises it all day, and finally loses it at ni i.
“Come down,” says he to me, “for a week; we’ve got a festival on.
We caſi it the festival of the Three Choirs, because we’ve got a very
decent lot out of the two parish churches a few miles from us, and our
own. It’s a great thing to encourage a musical taste,” says he, “and
I think you’ll like it.”
I accept, and ask if he takes a part.
“Take a part Of course—several.” Then he adds, “Do you
know the bass part in the old glee ‘The Little Birds Warble?’”
I do not, unfortunately. - - - -
“Ah, then,” says he, taking the opportunity for practising, “this
is how it goes.”
From his specimen I want to know why this sort of music was ever
called a “ Glee?” Good heavens ! if SILFoRD (who is singing awa
from a thick volume of very ºf music, while I am regard-
ing him thoughtfully) is correct, it is melancholy enough to hear one
perform this sort of thing, without troubling the fifteen voices for
whom it is arranged. Can I find some excuse for deferring my visit?
I think, but I only say, smiling with apparently awakened interest,
“That sounds rather”—he probably thinks I am going to say
“pretty,” but I don’t, and I won’t.
“Yes,” says SILFoºd, stopping in the middle of a sort of a wander-
ing bravura of several pages on the one word “little.” “There are six
bassi with me.”
“All singing the same ** I ask.
“Yes,” he answers, “all the same,” and off he goes again. “When
the Li-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e (working upwards) e-e-e-e-e (down again) e-e-e-e
(round and round in a circle of five notes I should say, until I wonder
the singer doesn’t become giddy), e-e-e, &c., &c., much the same over
again, until he perches on “it-tle,” which concludes the variations on
the word Little.
“Now,” says SILFORD, apologetically, “I can’t always get the next
bit quite right.”
As, at all events, he begins by fº the next little bit all wrong
I tell him, pleasantly, that I will leave him to practise it alone, an
then he gives me aº: of the amusements, which I see includes
the performance of several pieces without bass parts, also some old
, great favourites of mine, and so I accept his invitation.
A Day with the Little Man with a Big Woice.
He has been * quiet the night before, owing to a slight cold,
which depressed him so much that he retired early, and sat in
boiling water, drank hot, drinks, and slept under a weight of extra
blankets and coverlets. All he could do was to play his bass parts on
the piano, as he was afraid of forgetting 'em. -
Before bidding him “Good Night,” he warns me that he takes his
morning bath early, and always sings in it; so that if I do hear a noise,
I mustn't be alarmed.
But I am alarmed: for such a row by one voice, in a musical way,
as his makes in his bath, I never heard.
He takes cold water all through the year—as cold as he can get it.
“Strengthens your throat, my boy,” says he, knowingly : “capital
thing for the voice. So’s going on a hill, and singing against a fresh
breeze—that’s a first-rate 5. or out in the open air, anywhere, is an
excellent practice.” And, º there isn’t a part of the garden
where you can be free from him, whenever he's got a “bass part to
get up for next Thursday week.” - -
I am asleep at 7 A.M., and have no ideas on any subject in particu-
lar, least of all of getting up before half-past eight. I am awoke by
what first appear to me to be shouts of some person in distress. , Now,
when you are attired for your night's repose, and are disturbed while
taking that, repose, a man with any regard for propriety should, think
twice, at all events, before dashing out on any Quixotic errand. To
put on a dressing-gown in answer to a cry of anguish, may shake your
resolution, and, if no other sound reaches you, the difficulty of finding
your slippers (which never are in their proper place) will probably
determine you to go to bed again.
I am half awake. Another shout of horror, of terror, of — Good
heavens ! is it SILFoRD's voice In broad daylight, too ! What has
happened Another, louder and fiercer, from the room below, “Ha!
I defy you! ... Come not near me! HA!” I leap from the bed. Í
must fly to his rescue, when, just as I am putting my wrapper roun
me, I hear, evidently jovial and laughing, “Ha! ha / ha /−ha / haſ haſ
Neprends plus l’air patelin : . On connait tes farces, Jupin ſº Which I
recognise as the laughing chorus in M. OFFENBAch's, “Orphée aur
Enfers.” “Ha!, ha! haſ” goes his voice again, and then a shriek;
but with that shriek a splash, and after that follow briskly several
splashes and dashes, and dowses of water, through which come out in
sudden bursts, “Oh, meet me in the Lane when the clock strikes,”
*Sound an Alarmi" Sound an ala armſ”. “With a hey ! h9 chivy!
hark for’ard! Hark (gasp) for’ard (gasp) tan (gasp) tivy.'" “God
save our noble QUEEN ?? like a hand-organ under a cataract. All is
explained. SILForp is in his bath, and I am “not to be alarmed.”
I return to bed again, and listen. It is a fearful performance this of
SILFoRD's, alternating between the terrible, the agonising, the
glorious, and the utterly ridiculous. -
Thus:—dash of the sponge full of cold water: shriek: “Ah!”, then
in operatic recitative . recovering from the shock, “Villain!
approach me not, for i will—" dowse of sponge full again, which
produces a wildly frightened voice, as if he was being beaten, “Spare
me! Spare me!” to the second part of “Robert toi que j’aime.” . Then
(he never in this situation gives more than a fragment) another furious
spongeful, followed by—victoriously, as if he’d conquered the tyrant
who was sponging him—“Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves |
For Brit-ons i. never (splash) never (evidently a fearful struggle
with the imaginary person who is sponging him) NE-VER”—then, as if
he had escaped entirely, and was free as air, comes joyously a º
tune, “Up in a balloon | Up in a balloon!” rum ti tum ti ad lib.,
with a slight pause before the recommencement of hostilities. Then,
“I would I were a bird—” Another dowse from the sº lºt.
out the developed idea suggested by the last, song, in “We fly by
night—we (sponge and gasp) fly (sponge and gasp) by (the same)
might.” Then comes a sound as of a longer process of sponging-
perhaps he is standing up—which is accompanied by “A life on the
ocean wave, a home on the rolling deep.”. This is given defiantly to
the sponge. He is now out of it, as I can distinctly hear him scrubbing,
rubbing, and blowing over his hard brushes, gloves, and towels.
“Nothing like rubbings for the voice,” he explains to me afterwards.
During this, being jubilant, he never indulges in anything less than a
chorus, which on this occasion is all the bass part of the “Hallelujah,”
which he has to sing next Sunday “in another place,” as Members of
Parliament say.
Then he comes up-stairs, ready for breakfast, and “hopes he hasn't
disturbed me.”
To be Pasted up Along the Line.
HE is a Snob, and not a gentleman,
Who smokes upon the Me-tro-po-li-tan :
Yes, M'm, regard him as some arrant Snob,
Sent by his master to perform a job,
And meanly doing, while annoying you,
That which at home he would not dare to do.
Pity so low a Cad, nor wish him licked:
Perhaps to-day already he’s been kicked.
Humbugs.
THE Middlesex Magistrates, 44 to 30, again resolve that Catholic
Criminals in gaoſshai not have paid Catholic priests to see them. We
argue not with bigots. But, when those Yºr. talk about their
“consciences”—and then license, Music. Halls—we own to that sen-
tºuch. on board a steamboat, dictates a hasty call to the
steward.

RichMonn may boast of being one of the best Quts, and possessing
some of the best Inns near Town. Even as Punch writes the word a
hundred pleasant memories rise before him, recollections of delightful
banquets at which his aristocratic and withal genial countenance has
heightened its glow, of snug little parties at a corner table, of jovial
revels in the Castle “bowers,” and never to be forgotten feeds in the
The latter establish-
ment has even gone up higher in his estimation since it has taken to
itself another wing. The quiet old Roebuck (where it is not true
all the waiters answer to the name of John ARTHUR) is a good
house too, and we have played many a good knife and fork there, and
hope to do so again. The original name of Richmond was Sheen, and
it certainly must be sheen to be appreciated. It has been in the pos-
session of the Crown since the reign of Edward THE FIRST, and
Holixshed states that the earlier monarchs used “customarily thither
to resort as to a place of pleasure, and serving highly to their recrea-
tion.” He is silent, however, on the subject of º, with which
toothsome trifle the word Richmond is inseparably associated. In vain
ave we searched through the chroniclers, hunted up all sorts of
historians, dived into volumes on which the inst of ages has settled,
and questioned the cleverest and most date-crammed of our friend's

of leaving this charming locality without looking out for the celebrated
“Lass ºfº. Hill.” She is to be seen in every variety, as are
also the famous “Maids of Honour,” a combination of pastry and
cheese-cake, which is warranted as the most economical means of
achieving abilious attack at present known. The Poet in speaking of
the former attraction sets down the value of “the Lass” at a somewhat

[October 24, 1868.
MRs. Punch's, LETTERS TO HER. DAUGHTER.
MY DEAR CHILD, - - - - -- " " — -
BEFORE I proceed to discant upon Court-circulars, Croquet-
parties and other matters, I must give utterance to a feeling of unmiti;
gated astonishment that whilst our young ladies are so severely handled
under the name of The Girl of the Period, our young men go of scot
free. How right-minded mothers of daughters can support such all.
injustice, I cannot conceive; for I am sure that for every six Girls of
the Period, f could find half a dozen young gentlemen to match. As
you are no longer a Butter-cup, my JudLANA, which means a schºol-girl
according to writers of authority, but a grown-up young lady about to
enter society, it is highly desirable, that you should know sºmething
of that large portion of it, which may be distinguished as the Whiskerſ:
and Bearded; or perhaps a better classification, would be the To:
bacco-consuming tribe; for if I talk in the old-fashioned way about
two sexes, the stronger and the weaker, what will Miss BECKER and
her American supporters say * - - - - -
Oh, dear! what a queer and contradictory age is this? If one thing
seemed more certain than another, it was that men were men an
women were women; but now we are told that history has been be-
fooling us ever since the world began to spin, and that one sex has been
so nearly like t'other, that as the American said, you couldn't tell either
from which ; which is which or which is either, or if either be which,
I hope somebody will determine some day or other. - -
One thing I am quite sure of, however; and you will discover it for
yourself during the forthcoming season, when your Papa and I propose
to introduce you into the º artistic and fashionable circles;
namely, that the Young Man of the Period is an ass. Ah! my daughter,
from the way some women talk, one would fancy that every man was
as wise as SocRATEs—or why, such an ardent desire to be thought his
equal—but for my part, I think the question is not, Man rersus Woman,
but Wise rersus Foolish, and a wise woman will be thought a wis,
man's equal any day. Having stated that the Young Man officieriod
is an ass, I will tell you a little about ilis bray, which is mostly a very
mild and soft-sounding bray, though at times a touch of ferocity may
be detected in it, when the ass is an aesthetic ass, abusing his critics it
he be an author, the public if he be an artist, and the best writers and
artists of the day if he be merely an amateur. - - - -
The Young Man of the Period has a faculty of depreciation quite
unparalleled in history, and when he takes you into supper, or flatters
you over the croquet game, do not for a minute imagine yourself
charming in his eyes. K. women are fools and all women are in loye
with his especial sclf, thinks the Young Man, of the Period; and he
arrays his bewitching person in clothes made by the royal tailor, and
talks the same talk all the year round, and never finds out why all
women seem alike and everything a bore. -
Occasionally one meets with a sentimental Young Man of the Period,
who delights in being tormented by some accomplished and, unscru-
pulous flirt, most likely old enough to be his mother, and has very
elevated notions of that sort of woman to the depreciation of all others.
He hates men and men's doings, reads fast ladies' novels, lounges in
fast ladies' drawing-rooms, manages to find the same sort of company
abroad, and looks down upon the sober world that earns its victuals,
and does its duty with supreme scorn.
The Young Man of the Period certainly does one thing for Society:
he spares no pains to make his person as Charming as possible; his
º his complexion, his teeth, are matters of daily and earnest solici-
tude. If nature has endowed him with a shapely foot or a small hand,
he could weep for joy when his boots and gloves fit to perfection. But
the crowning joy of the Young Man of the Period is his mind: he
cultivates it by reading the most satirical of the weekly papers, by
smoking inordinately, by getting into debt, and by writing travels,
poems or novels, which he is delighted to see in print; this possession
of his never disappoints him—I mean his mind.
What do the old fogies know? What are the old fogies good for 2
Half-a-dozen fellows of our set, thinks the Young Man of the Period,
are worth all our fathers and grandfathers put together; and he seems
in his own eyes, twice as clever as they, because he can spend so liberally
what they accumulated with so many privations.
The Young Man of the Period, who has entered the Church, will be
sure to come in your way, ere long, my JUDIANA, since he is, seen to
º perfection at social gatherings in the country. This harmless
ooking being does not possess the angelic temper one would at first
sight impute to him. Many things of late, the Irish Church especially,
have soured his temper; and he can be Jesuitically severe upon occa-
sions. Women, in his eyes, were born to work altar-cloths, curates'
slippers, and coddle up their husbands with tea and broth when suffering
from depression, caused by Dissenters, the Rock, and MR. TUPPER's
ballads. Man, represented by a High-Church Bishop is a demi-god;
woman, a ministering slave.
Well may the mothers of daughters—I mean, Buttercups, wonder
from what ranks future sons-in-law are to be recruited. Fancy these
cool young satirists, these industrious spendthrifts, these loungers in
foreign hotels, these clerical despots turned husbands !
I really think that the State ought to interfere and draw up a code
of articles to be signed by all parties about to contract matrimonial
alliances. Certainly, the first t ºff to be taken in hand by ladies pos-
sessing Parliamentary influence is the Reformation of the Young Man
of the Period. A Reform Bill dealing with a question of such vast
social importance, would have to be handled with great skill and
delicacy; but in the absence of that, surely such questions as these
ought to be put by mothers to future sons-in-law before the Banns
are published:—
Supposing that unforeseen circumstances occur, state the occupation
by which you could earn your salt.
Are your Tailor's and Perfumer's bills such as you would have any
delicacy in mentioning *
How many Locks of Hair are in your possession ? Can you give
a satisfactory account of cach.
State the minimum quantity of claret, champagne, soda-water, cigars,
and Bass's ale on Wºl. you can subsist per diem.
Appraise yourself at your own worth, and declare the estimation.
Do you bet on the Turf
Do you lose at Billiards 2
Have you made up your mind to relinquish little dinners at Rich:
mond, little suppers elsewhere, and other bachelor enjoyments with a
good grace.
Can you condescend to forsake “the fellows at the club,” and dine
at home with your wife off a leg of mutton :
Can you amuse yourself and your wife on wet Sundays in the country
Can you give up the delightful homage of all the ladies of your
acquaintance, and content yourself with as much homage as your wife
sees ſit to bestow upon you ?
Lastly, did you ever try the experiment of making ends meet?
Other questions might with advantage be put, but I will leave them
for the present, contenting myself with having thrown out a hint. Be
on your guard against the Young Man of the Period, my daughter,
whether you meet him at croquet parties, pic-nics, balls, or archery
meetings, and profit by the advice of
Your simple, but not to be trampled-down Mother,
M Rs. PUNch.
AN EXCUSE FOR MONKEYS TRICKS.
PLEASE Sir, “ there being two slight inaccuracies in your interesting
report of the Harvest Thanksgiving Festival at All Saints', Lambeth,

recently addressed to the Editor of the Times. They constitute an
excuse for playing at Roman Catholics to which the only suitable

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
(A Few Words on a Foolish Practice.)
HERE is so much to
be seen in London
just now, that I have
en obliged to write
to MRs. BLANQUE
three times to put off
my return to Stow-
in-the-Hole from
“the great Metrolo-
pus,” as MR. CoMP-
ton used to say in
An Unequal Match.
Overflowing, as is my
pen, I must get rid
of some of the super-
fluous ink in writing
down a practice
which, commenced in
all kindness and with
the best possible mo-
tives, is now growing
into an abuse. My
pen is to be put in
rest against the abuse
of º". a first
night's performance
of a piece. What is a
call? (By the way,
what an augury ºf
success it would be for a future Roscius to be born with a caulº). By
a “call” is intended on the part of the audience an especial public
testimony to the artist's skill. It is over and above applause; or rather
it is the sum total of applause. Thus it may be stated algebraically:
the denominations being Laughter, Hiss, Delight, the L. Hiss. D. of
the Theatrical Addition and Subtraction. -
By delight I mean evidenced delight; that is, clapping of hands:
m = much, m = none. s = some.

For a final and first-rate situation 0 0 m (mx m)*
m” + m + m + m” + m (m x m)* = a call before the curtain at the
end of the Act.
And this call may be taken as the algebraic expression of aggregate
feeling. But the calling at the end of an Act is a vicious custom at
best, savouring of vulgar impertinent curiosity on the part of the public,
and is sofar uncomplimentary to the artist as it hints, its desire to
praise while praise can be given, a suspicion of his being unable to
endure to the end.
Supposing an audience to be justly inclined, let me give a sketch of
what the calls would probably be,
We are present at the first night of
THE DARK LANES OF LONDON,
Written by the celebrated author MR. PRIGGIWIGG, and produced
under the direction of MR. DASH, the eminent actor and lessee. . The
uppercrust audience is lº. with a bill of the play. It is beau-
tifully got up, laced, and scented. They are put into a good temper;
a great point for the success of the coming piece.
vidently here is the First Call.
Audience in Bowes, Stalls, and Dress Circle (shouting).
Printer / Printer //
[In the midst of these cries MR. BURJoICE, of Little Friars Lane,
Lambeth, steps before the curtain and gracefully acknowledges the
compliment.
But the bill for the pit and gallery is not so good. Evidently another
call.
Pit, Gallery, &c. Printer | Printer / |
[Cat-calls and hissing. MR. BURJoice reappears, and in answer to
the furious hissing from the pit and gallery, attempts an expla–
nation, but is unable to obtain a hearing.
The Gas arrangements now attract public attention, and the plaudits
are loud and long as MEssRs. METEOR & SoNs (to the number of five),
*g before the curtain and modestly bow their thanks.
Some parts of the House have been re-decorated. This is another
call, and as the cushions appear to be kept in good order, and the
Printer ||
place generally is free from dust, the audience testify its appreciation
in the usual manner.
Audience (enthusiastically). Cleaner | Cleaner / Cleaner// -
[Three Old Women enter at P.S., and walk across the stage curtseying
their acknowledgments.
Then after hissing the box-keepers and checktakers, and the .
of the refreshment saloon, the Conductor of the Orchestra takes his place
The Conductor may have to respond for himself in the first instance,
then the call (after the undergraduate fashion in their theatre at Com-
memoration time) may be for his Tailor, or his haberdasher, or his
florist; viz., if he has such a superb coat as used to adorn the person of
the lamented great MONS, M. JULLIEN, or a magnificent white tie or
shirt, or a rare flower in his button-hole. -
Nert Calls. For the Composers of the pieces of music played by the
orchestra, then for the Publishers—then the Play commences.
Scene 1.- A Street in Westminster, with a view of a Dust-heap, and
bºnd, the Sºnentinº and Primrose Hills in ihe distance ºn the
left is a House entirely built, with all the Rooms perfectly furnished,
and the Cellars '...} with wine. Prolonged cheering.
Calls. First for the Scene Painter, for being so clever as to carry out
without bungling the author's design. This call is hardly complimen-
tary, because it seems to express astonishment on the part of the
audience at his being able to do such a thing. - -
2nd Call. For the Manager—being to compliment him for having
been so fortunate as to secure such a scenic artist and such an author.
All the respondents to these calls walk a few paces on to the stage,
lift their eyes to the gallery, wag their heads, disclaiming all merit,
much as to say, “Don’t, don't! You mustn't really l’” and back out,
keeping a sharp look-out, on the audience, as if they expected it, in
sheer fickleness, to suddenly take up things and throw at them.
3rd Call. For the Carpenters who built the House.
4th Call. For the Property-man who furnished it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Call one, Call all, or call none, excepting exceptions. “Calling” is
fast becoming a matter of first-night routine, and losing its value as a
public reward of merit. -
Of my Alhambra Ballet I must treat next week. Space forbids.
Postscript.—Why do M. of experience force a piece by hot-
house process? Is the strawberry in January equal to the strawberry
in June And why do not Critics withhold their judgment on such a
first-night performance, contenting themselves with a few lines of
public warning to the rash Manager? As pieces are now-a-days pro-
duced, that is, without sufficient rehearsal (“sufficient” applying more
to mode and system than to time), to come to anything like a fair
decision upon their merits is next to an impossibility at a first night's
representation, which is, in nine cases out of ten (to the actors', scene
artists’, and stage-managers' shame be it spoken), only a dress
rehearsal. - - -
I am led to these remarks by a recent visit to the Adelphi. I had
seen Monte Christo abused in the criticisms on its production. I have
no hesitation in saying, that if the third might could have been the
first, no unfavourable verdict would have been recorded. But, on the
contrary, it would have been pronounced a great success, likely, to
hold its own for many a month io come. MR.WEBSTER is admirable
in it, specially in his marvellous “make-up” as the Inspector of
Prisons. MR. FEchten, as the Abbé Busoni (who ought to be called
the ABBá BELLEw, so closely does he in this resemble that popular
entertainer), and, as the Count ºf Monte Cristo, is the very picture
drawn by ALEXANDER THE GREAT. No better duel than that between
MEssRs. FEchTER and PHILLIPs has been seen on the stage for some
time; and if only that prison scene, with MR. STUART's long-winded
story of Lucrezia Bongia and the College of Cardinals could be
shortened, there would be no delay in the action from beginning to
end. At this and all other Theatres let the Public judge for itself. |
THE NEW EXCHANGE; |bodi

THERE is a newspaper devoted, we hear, entirely to publishing offers
of exchange. Hitherto the plan, though economically valuable, has
not been generally taken up, and this may be owing to the want of a

ELECTION ADDRESSES.
WI.-DECIDEDLY CAUTIOUS.
To the Electors of Bamborough.
GENTLEMEN (I am debarred from saying Ladies and Gentlemen,
after the adverse decision of the Revising Barrister),
A Dissolution of Parliament, being looked upon as not improbable,
I, yielding, with pardonable pride to a requisition signed, as I have
ascertained by a careful examination of the Borough Register, by a
clear majority of your number, am not unwilling to become a Čič
for the representation of my native town in the Imperial Legislature.
With reference to the principal political questions now awaiting an
answer, I have deliberately weighed all that is to be said on both sides,
and am therefore fully prepared to give such a summary of my sentiments
as I should rejoice to find was considered satisfactory by a Constituency
so unprejudiced as that of Bamborough.
There are those who believe that Parliamentary, Reform has been
indulged in to a dangerous, a ruinous excess, and who predict that the
funeral of the British Constitution will take place at an early date;
there are others who would do ten times more than has already been
done, and who º a future for their ºnly of such prosperity
and power as history can º no example. I do not participate in
the despair of the alarmists; I am not carried away by the enthusiasm
of the sanguine.
I shall vote for the º graceful extinction of the Irish State
Church, if the Catholics desire it, and the Protestants do not object
to it, and a decided majority of the House demand it; and I shall be
ready carefully to examine the details of any scheme that may appear
to me to ensure a fair and º: application of the revenues of the
Establishment—when it has been disendowed.
I am a loyal subject of the Church of England, but yet I respect the
conscientious opinions of those numerous and influential religious
ies who have separated themselves from her doctrine and discipline,
and have always regretted that I was not in Parliament when Church
Rates disappeared from the programme of party, nothing in the world
being so agreeable, to my temperament, as a judicious compromise.
With an impartial hand I would check the innovations of the extrava-
gant, and correct the laxity of the indifferent, amongst the Clergy.
Economy in our National Expenditure is essential; efficiency in our
National $º is not inferior in importance. Let there be
brought under my notice some plan which shall lighten the burdens of
the people and at the same time insure the safety and welfare of the
QUEEN's dominions, and no man in the House will give it a more pro-
tracted consideration than I shall.
The various religious communities will, I trust, be able to agree on
some comprehensive measure of National Education which, without
offending the conscience or interfering with that personal liberty of
action so justly prized by Englishmen, will offer, the means of instruc-
tion to every child in the realm. When this happens, I shall not be
found absent from the ranks of the workers against ignorance. It will
not surprise me if I live to see, the day when the nation shall claim
and the universities yield the abolition of religious disqualifications.
The great landed proprietors of this country have º to form them-
selves into Leagues in favour of the adoption of the Ballot to secure
my humble co-operation.
In the same spirit of concession, I would say to those who have
dominant influence in towns which though ancient and respectable are
now faded and forgotten—intimate your willingness, to submit to the
political extinction of these, boroughs, and I will, in my admiration
ive my voice for the transfer of their elec-
toral privileges to other and more important centres of industry and
enterprise. -
One word in conclusion. You tell me that it is your practice to defray
by a subscription amongst yourselves all the election expenses of the
Candidate º your free choice. I have not language at my command
sufficiently strong to express my unqualified F. of so excellent a
custom, and one so creditable to the enlightened constituency º:
suffrages I hope speedily to be placed in the proud position of Member
for Bamborough. Your faithful Servant,
Swan Egg Lane, E.C. BARTHOLOMEw TRIMMER.
Precaution for Prelates.
THERE is a Person who may not perhaps be quite so scarlet as she is
painted. What is there to prevent the Pope from giving Ritualists
one over to Rome a dispensation to remain ostensibly in the English
hurch, and there act the part of decoy-ducks in regard to geese?
You may be tolerably certain that he has, in fact, done no such thing;
but, my Lords Bishops, would it not be well to make assurance on that
point doubly sure by immediately taking all practicable measures in the
several dioceses over which you preside for making a clean sweep of
Ritualist duffers?

is hard to say whether they deliver letters or fire with more precision.
It is clear that they may be trusted with any post.

VERMIN AND BAKING POWDERS:
IND how you use baking pow-
der. this:—
FAMILY FROM Poison ING.- .
The family of a shoemaker,
near Pontefract, has had a
narrow escape from , being
poisoned. It appears that the
servant girl was about to make
a pudding for dinner, and asked
her mistress for a baking pow-
der. She was directed to a
drawer, but instead of taking a
:ket of baking powder, she
in mistake took a vermin powder
—another illustration of the
careless manner in which
poisonous articles are kept.”
Five of them partook of
this pudding, and were very
near going the way of effec-
tually baned rats. For fur-
ther details, see the Post of
- October 20th. . But you
should take care how you use *...i powders, not merely because if
you don't you may use vermin powders instead. In the first place
—witness the Lancet—the baking powders, if egg powders, may be
coloured with chromate of lead; in which case you might nearly as
well use vermin powders. In the next, baking powders are, according
to the same authority, at best a mixture of carbonate of soda an
tartaric acid, with a small quantity of rice or flour, and act by producing
a sham fermentation. You would, perhaps, prefer the real.
Egg powders not containing chromat of lead may be innocuous,
Ladies, but they are innutritious. They may be very good to make
puddings for children and others with whom eggs disagree. Otherwise
there is nothing so true than, as the popular saying affirms, that “eggs
ls ; ”—and that nothing else is. %. the worst of these powders,
be they ever so harmless is, Ma'am, that if cooks are not looked sharp
after, there will be eggs in your bills, but, in lieu of eggs, egg powder
in your puddings and pies.
or further information on this subject, see a fourpenny pamphlet,
On the Practice of Employing certain Substitutes for the genuine Ingre.
dients of some Articles of Daily Food. By a Lady. Therefrom it would
appear, that if you have any baking powder, and also any vermin
powder, the best thing, you can do with them is to mix them both
together, and put them in the way of vermin.
PAPAL PLUSH IN PARLIAMENT.
QF course no man can serve two masters, but Fº Dundalk
and Rome (ecclesiastical) are one place. Yet should the Irish Romish
borough re-elect its present representative, it will have a Parliamentary
servant in livery of another description than any which he has worn
heretofore. Such, at least will be the case if there is truth in the state-
ment referred to by a contemporary as follows:—
“SIR GeoRGE Bowy ER.—It is stated that SIR. GeoRGE Bowy ER, Bart.,
M.P. for Dundalk, has just been made a member of the Pontifical Household,
having been appointed by his Holiness the Pope as one of his Chamberlains
in recognition of his services to the Roman Catholic Church.”
Is the Pontifical Household identical with the original Household of
Faith?, Then, how many chamberlains were there in that primitive
establishment, and did they wear the same plush, lace, shoulder-knots,
or other peculiarities of uniform as those in which, according to the
above-quoted announcement, SIR GEORGE Bowy ER will be qualified, if
ermitted, to appear as the Member for Dundalk and Rome in the
ouse of Commons?

“Pray silence for the Char!” It is sometimes taken for trout, but

..". notice of Belle Isle, an island containing a º;
round dwelling-house, supposed to be the most perfect brick and mortar
embodiment of the “domestic circle” extant; nor should the Two
Pikes be missed, though you needn't look for them in the water, because
they’re not there; and so on to Coniston, where you will meet with the
Old Man. This is a mountain (nothing to do with the Old Man of the
Mountain—oh no, we mean the Old Man of the Sea—eh? Which is
it? Never mind), and the Walna Scar road here, passing through
Church Coniston, takes you to some wonderful scenery, on, which
WoRDsworth wrote—-
“That mountain stream, where shepherd and his cot
Are privileged inmates of deep solitude.”
This is absurd. How can a cot be an inmate 2 Now if it was altered
to “where Shepherd and his Creswick,” it would read sensibly, at all
events. But we forgot; this is a guide to Cumberland, not Surrey.
The Lake of Coniston is also called Thurston Water, which is a mean-
ingless title—thirst on water | A lake, too ! Isn’t it absurd, now, on the
face of it? . PROFEssoR WILsoN, º of the view from the moun-
tain side at Lowwood, close by, says, “Bold or gentle promontories
break all the banks, into frequent bays.” The only bank we should
imagine that would be likely to break into a bay would be—now, are
you quite prepared , . Well, Dog-ger Bank, then—there ! But the
subject of banks breaking is always unpleasant, and so on to Ambleside,
which is a most irregular little town, dating its wickedness from
its very foundation, which is itself badly inclined. It abounds in villas
in fact, as an irreverentjester has observed, it
“Possesses every kind of villa—nigh.”
We are sorry to have to speak the truth about Ambleside, but it should
behave better, and mend its ways, which are }. rocky, though plea-
sant, more especially that leading to Rydal, which you are particularly

Lady (with substantial luncheon) to her Maid. “You MAY Ask For A GLAss of WATER AND A BUN, PARKER, IF You LIKE."
PHYSICAL FORCE CONSERVATIVE MACHINES.
WHATEvKR MR. BRIGHT, MR. GLADSTONE, and the great Liberal
party may think as to the expediency of conserving the British Consti-
tution, they are no doubt all prepared to vote for the Conservation of
Force. As far as that goes also, the followers of MR. DisrAELI may
safely trust him for being a true Conservative, and not betra ; them
by insensible education. It will, therefore be #. On 3. sides
that MR. ERicsson, the original designer of the onitor, has done the
state, and every state, some service if he really has, as he is said to
have, succeeded in constructing a machine for collecting and applying
the force which, in the form of heat, radiates from the sun. Perhaps
there are few young ladies now who do not know that the sun is #.
one sole origin of all force, though we get it immediately out of coal
for our steam-engines, and for our limbs, and those of our horses,
out of the food and provender with which we stoke ourselves and them.
Most girls who have read SwiFT-a, much fitter, author for them
than any sensational novelist—in laughing at the idea of extracting
sunbeams from cucumbers, have nevertheless recollected that this
is what they themselves do, whenever they eat cucumbers, if they
digest them; and then that the sunbeams may actually re-appear in the
; of a sparkling eye. -
It is suggested that a steam-engine of any horse-power might be set
in .."; the sun, and made to compress all its force into springs,
therein to be stored for use. Mºº one prevents Mr. Punch from
saying that this is a very clever idea, for he himself not very long ago
started, as far as the º: of force É. the very same. 5. y,
instead of going directly to the sun for force, he proposed to derive it
from certain intermediate sources; namely, convicts under sentence of
mal servitude or imprisonment and hard labour. He pointed out, he
§. that a c worked by a º might, instead of
wasting muscular energy on the prison air, be made to stock it by the
condensation of air confined in iron cylinders. For practical purposes
it matters not of what material the spring to be the reservoir of force
may consist, whether it be gaseous or metallic. If, however, MR.
ERicsson’s conservation of force machine is preferable to the con-
trivance suggested by Mr. Punch, let it by all means be rather adopted.
Only don't suffer the force now uselessly expended by convicts to be
any longer thrown away, “Unproductive labour” in gaols and
houses of correction is simply a sinful waste of oatmeal, molasses,
potatoes, bread, and all the beef or mutton that may be allowed for the
unproductive labourer's consumption. Primarily it is so much sun-
power, ultimately wasted. The sun must needs shine both upon the
just and on the unjust ; the former employ its force in uses—there is
no reason why the latter should be not only allowed, but even con-
strained to throw it away.
There is much other muscular power besides that exerted at the
Grank and on the treadmill, squandered in motion, which if not unpro-
ductive labour, is, un roductive force. In dancing, for instance,
could not the impulse of the light fantastic toe, by a suitable mechanism
connected with floors, be made to communicate force, to some sort of
spring of sufficient delicacy, which would retain it till wanted The
accumulated force of all the dancing that goes on would be enormous.
Look at the quantity of force that is dissipated during the spring and
summer in London by young oarsmen racing and pulling up the river.
It might be too much to expect them to pull away at conservation of
force engines instead; but some of them might be pleased to do that
occasionally for the benefit of their fellow-citizens as well as their own
recreation. There are, also many young men of large fortune and no
business, for whose idle hands mischief, as DR. WATTs says, is con-
tinually found by Somebody to do. Thus is force worse than wasted,
whereas it might be treasured for good purposes if those who have
no better employment could occasionally be induced to amuse themselves
by taking a turn at the machine for its conservation.

keeps eft eye on it while he pours tea out for me with his right
hand. He glances at it while he holds out his plate, and he fixes hi
mind upon it; that is, he thinks he does; even when talking to me.
For he does talk, this breakfast practice being to keep the notes before
his eyes, and so to get ’em into his throat that way, and also to fancy
himself singing, so that he is having an inaudible rehearsal, and, except
when he is carried away by some theme which may be started in the
course of our conversation, he talks to me in that staccato manner, peculiar
to young ladies who try to keep up a flirtation with you while they are
{}. SIGNOR SCHERzo's elegant variations on “Maggie Lauder.”
inder such conditions a flirtation is well worth keeping up, it being a
g-room purgatory to the young lady who, in all probability,
thoroughly deserves such refined torture. As, however, I am not
ealing with young ladies, but with BILLY SILFoRD, the Little Man with
the Big Voice, let me continue.
I camot interest him in politics (I don't mind his having his music-
paper up before him, because thereby I get the newspaper all to my:
self), nor in the weather; so I become absorbed in the Times, and
breakfast time glides peacefully away.
Having finished the Times, and finding that the state of the world
generally will not materially affect my arrangements for to-day, I ask
SILPQRI, what he is going to do.
“Well,” says he, “I must get up this thing : there's a particular
passage I can't catch for the life of me. Stop!”
As if suddenly inspired, he turns away from me, and goes into a
corner, with his faee to the wall, like a naughty boy.
Here he begins growling to himself, with his head first declined then
ſº in order to get out the bass notes and the higher notes; and
this makes him look like a duck feeding.
..I hear him trying several low notes in his voice. I feel a sort of
pity for him ; I should almost like to pat him on the back, as officious
##". will do when you’re choking, and say, “Never mind, old boy:
it’ll do you good.” But I'm afraid he’d be offended.
The attempt is abortive; and so, after alternately making double
chins (which is his mode of producing double bass) and stretching his
neck out as though he were easing it over the points of an overstarched
collar, he gives it up for the present and comes out for a walk.
He is nothing if not musical. If I start, as a topic, the elections, it
only suggests to him the notion that if candidates might sing their
i. how easily SANTLEY might come in for some imaginary
orough.
The mention of SANTLEY leads him on to ask me if I remember that
eminent vocalist's rendering of “Ruddier than the Cherry,” of which he
immediately stops in the road to give me reminiscences., . He does it
with a i. deal of waggling of his head and elevating his eyebrows,
and suddenly breaks off with, “Ah! what a voice he has 1” as a sort
of tºº. his own performance.
The political state of Italy is nothing to him compared with its
musical state; and a question of mine as to the progress of philosophy
in Germany, merely opens a way to him to introduce, at the corner of
a lane, under a sign-post, an imitation of HERR ForMEs, as Marcel,
singing “Piff. Paff.” - -
My Little Man with a Big Voice is very fond of “Piff Paff,” and of
his souvenirs of HERR ForMEs : he will
encourage him, as I do BILLY SILPoRD) whether you remember LA-
BLACHE. If you say that you do, he will merely say, “Ah! there was a
fine voice!” and subside into an interior contemplation of that great
vocalist's performance. If you do not remember the original, you will
be immediately treated to, as it were, a Lablache Entertainment, which
you won't forget in a hurry.
... I suggest, at the conclusion of what I may term the third part; that
is, LABLAche as Dulcamara; that we should continue our walk.
“Ah,” says he, as we stride along again, “I wish I had such a voice
as that...Stop a moment!” he cries, suddenly. Is he ill? He turns

I beg his pardon. “I really didn’t know —” -
“No,” he says, slightly put out, “of course you couldn't know; but
when you see a fellow trying to get a tune, you oughn't to interrupt.”
I won't again, I promise, and we walk on.
I try him upon the subject of travel. Does he know Rome?
Ah! wouldn't he like to go there, and hear the Gregorians in the
“Hang it!” º
Sistine Chapel.
I have unconsciously set him off on a favourite subject. Little
ly
style affords for a voice like his.
“You see,” he explains, “with a regular Gregorian you can pull if
out,” in which expression he treats his voice as if it were a sort of
trombone." There’s something so simple and solemn in a Gregorian:
it goes straight to your heart.” By the way, I once went to hear
SILFoRD sing Gregorian in a chapel. I have no doubt it would have
gone straight to my heart, if it hadn't stopped somewhere on the road,
and made me feel very uncomfortable.
By the way, BILLY, is not a High Churchman, except in point of
musical taste; he is decidedly a Low Churchman in voice, and a broad
one in his views on such questions, and where music is the considera.
tion. I have known him figuring away in the choir of a Catholic
. º to sing; and BILLY in a
rocession, with a large book and a surplice, is an impressive sight.
e is indefatigable in his own parish, and when we return from our
walk he expects the Choir for practice. I don’t think this voluntary
association is so enthusiastic as SILFoRD, for only two come, and they
are both baritones. So they grumble and growl together, and try
fugues arranged for ten voices, with seven imagined. -
| A friend looks in, after this practice is over, and accidentally, while
looking out of window, hums. -
SILFoRD immediately accompanies him with a bass to the tune. The
Hummer leaves off, thinking SILFoRD's bass a hint to be quiet. On
i. contrary, SILFoRD begs him to continue, as he wants to try his
aSS.
This is a peculiarity with my Little Man with a Big Voice. He
never can hear any tune started without evincing an irrepressible
desire to harmonise it, whether with a bass or a second. If the bass
fails, he will try a second, or rice rersä. The Man with an Ear has no
chance against him : if he begins to hum, Little Man with a Big Voice
lays wait for him attentively, catches him up about the fourth bar, and
insists upon -
because, as SILFord doesn't always hum to time, but is invariably
º for a harmony at all hazards, he has to let each note get (so to
speak) a little ahead of him before he can tack on something like an
appropriate one from his bass stock. * -
| The effect is curious, and generally, unless SILFORD meets with a
very determined Hummer with a º". of self-abstraction, results in
the starter of the tune treating the matter as a contest, and giving
it up.
An hour before dinner (we are dining early in the afternoon, because
he has to keep his voice clear for the rehearsal in the evening), I see
him standing in the summer-house, engaged, apparently, in the exami-
nation of some minute object at his feet—a snail perhaps.

thing which is agonising him.
I go up to him. -
“Oh, hang it!” he says, reproachfully; “I wish you wouldn't. It’s
the third time you’ve done it to-day.”
“What?” I ask, innocently.
“Why, disturbed me just as I’d got it. How the deuce can a fellow
ever get a passage right if, directly he hits on the starting note cor-
rectly, you halloo out to him; in another key altogether, too ! ”
I say I’ll leave him to himself. -
“Oh!” he exclaims, despairingly, “it’s, all gone now. I might
have got it, and been perfect before dinner.”
After the rehearsal and the last try at night, he comes to my room in
his dressing-gown. Without saying a single word, he stands at the
door, and delivers himself of the bass passage required in “h hen the

THE SPANISH REVOLUTION.
(From our own Correspondent.)
IN answer to several questions on matters of detail in the present
crisis, we beg to state that GENERAL PRIM is not a Quaker. Also,
that the Rose, which bears his name was not so called after him.
b ºw the Spanish Onions have risen in a body. I perfectly
eitetxe tº.
The Anti-Slavery Society have memorialised the Spanish Provisional
Government. foreigner, hearing this, quoted Hamlet’s line—
“What's 'Cuba to him, or he to 'Cuba?”
Freedom of thought is proclaimed everywhere. I am thinking what
like, and so is everybody else. Expression, however, is dangerous,
and even a countenance may be mistaken.
Religious Equality is also proclaimed, and, as a commencement, all
the property of the Monastic or Conventual Institutions has been
confiscated, and appropriated to the present uses of the Provisional
Government.
This is levelling, down. (Why not level up (as I said to PRIM my-
self), by placing all Religious bodies on an equality with your Monastic
Communities? PRIM said it was § a Provisional Government, and
that, in short, he begged I wouldn't bother, as he didn't exactly—and
—would I call to-morrow. Poor fellow !
I cannot write any more at present, as I have got to dine with the
Junta at Madrid. Being a Provisional Government, of course they’re
bound to provide dinners for everyone. Do you recollect our child-
hood's song— -
“Rain, Rain,
Go to Spain.”
Well, here it is; and, if I didn't know the joke was such a despe-
rately old one, I should say that, although the Queen no longer reigns,
yet—but I will say it, at dinner to-day: they don’t know it here
and the Junta will be delighted. PRIM and SERRANo were enchante
with my song about IsabelLA.
For, oh, poor IsabelLA,
You are the sort of fellar,
To sit inside a Cellar,
And mend an Umbe-rel-lar.
The above has a political signification, which you could only under-
stand by having resided in Spain for some time."
You cannot stay at home, Ma'am,
Then why not go to Rome, Ma'am,
Or cross the ocean's foam, Ma'am,
And go to Angle terrey.
"or, oh, poor Isa BELLAR, &c., as before.
Here’s a good thing, said by PRIM. (N.B. Private and not to be
printed. Put it in, because I’ve pledged my word to him that it should
appear in Punch.) - -
‘What,” he asked, “is the difference between a certain fashionable
colour and our resent Government?”

Important Announcement.
MR. BEAREs has recognised the Spanish Revolution, which is very
much gratified. He is, however, less satisfied with Vesuvius, and
means to call the attention of the Reform League to the conduct of
that mountain, and possibly to propose a vote of censure on the eruption.

A WOLUNTEER POLICE WANTED.
“CoNSTABLEs, form, form,” might be the first line of a song by which MR.
TENNYson will perhaps do fondon the service of creating a Volunteer Police.
Under the orders of SIR Richard MAYNE, the Metropolitan Policemen, are
employed in taking dogs into custody, and seizing hoops, instead of lººking
after thieves and apprehending footpads. As appears from the letter of “E.”
in the Times, not one Police-officer can be spared at Scotland Yard to watch a
house which it is known that burglars intend to break into. The regular Police-
men have as much work as they can do in the service of catching curs and
mongrels, and hoop-hunting, assigned to them by their Chief. Literally, the Police
has gone to the dogs. Roughs and footpads range the streets, committing outrages
unmolested, enjoying a system of strict non-intervention. Society is in a state of
absolute invasion.
There are many spirited young men, possessed of wealth, but not provided with
work, who do that of coachmen, for want of better. They are driven by idleness
to drive, four-in-hand. Some pop, their time away in pigeon-shooting, others kill
it at billiards, and by various other unproductive amusements. The practical
duties of Policemen would afford them ample pastime with the advantage of excite-
ment, attended by the new and pleasurable feeling of conscious utility rewarded
by the thanks of Business and the smiles of Beauty, in the balcony as well as at
the area. Constables, therefore, form, form; that is to say, Swells, get sworn in as
special constables, and organise yourselves into divisions. Graspyour truncheons;
go forth on your beats; and arrest the street robbers whilst the paid protectors of
the public and preservers of the peace are occupied, by command of SiR Richard
MAYNE, in the capture of canine vagabonds, and a crusade against children.

AN arrangement has been made for all cases arising out of the new dog-code to
be tried by MR. CoMMIssionER KERR.

[November 7, 1868.
WILL THERE BE WAR P
ow that the French news-
papers are full of informa-
tion upon this momentous
question, it seems absurd
to talk about the press as
being “gagged,” when daily
it . such intelligence
as follows:–
“We hasten to apprise
our readers of an interesting
circumstance
cul on the
the EMPERoR's late visit to
the camp at Châlons. As
the cavalry, (10,000 strong)
were marching past at a
hand-gallop, the eagle eye
of his Majesty, with the aid
of a large opera-glass, dis-
cerned that seven of the
horses had, each of them,
a nail missing in one of their
hind shoes. Subsequent ex-
amination proved that the
EMPERoR had been accu-
rately correct in detecting
this deficiency in the equip-
- - - - - ment of his troops. Trifling
in itself, the incident acquires a marked importance from the fact that
it shows, with what a searching scrutiny the Emperor reviews his
army; and proves therefore that his Majesty considers War as immi-
nent.”—Le Menteur du Midi.
." The fact is not less interesting than, as we think, significant, that
his. Highness, the Prince Imperial, has, under the guidance of his
ºilitary, tutor been sketching out a plan for a Winter Campaign.
When it, is remembered that youths are prone to imitate the actions of
their fathers, it . be readily imagined that the EMPEROR is engaged
upon a similar employment as the one which now soprofitably occupies
the leisure of the Prince.”—Courrier de Fourille.
“Panic-mongers we are not, but we cannot help observing a curious
cºincidence. ears, as has been proved, are often similar in decades.
Now, the vintage has this autumn been extraordinarily fine. Since
that of 1858, no wine has been grown equal to it. But France has not
forgotten yet that 1858 was followed by 1859, and that a fine vintage
ºf the red wine of Bordeaux was the prelude of the red tide which
flowed at Solferino. So the rare wine we are making now in 1868 may
in, 1869 refresh our gallant soldiers, when they return triumphant from
Rhineland and the Danube.”The Fräion Bordeidi.
‘....We hasten to announce that, as a welcome addition to the batteries
at Dieppe, the gallant garrison who have the charge of the old Château
were put yesterday in command of a new batterie de cuisine. By a like
ºil. attention to the wants of our brave army in the present
warlike crisis, a new soup ladle was supplied for the table of the officers,
a companied most opportunely by half-a-dozen napkins and nine electro:
plated spoons. This addition to the stores and matériel of war, in a
fortress, so important as the Château de Dieppe, may be accepted as a
proof that a campaign is now regarded well high as a certainty by the
ever-watchful Government of France.”—Rataplan du Nord.
“With every desire to É. a peaceable construction on the circum-
stance that Prussia has reduced, in a slight measure her preposterously
large, and in fact, unwieldy army, we regret that, on the contrary, to
us it seems to indicate a settled warlike purpose." Why should Prussia
have dismissed some hundred thousand of her troops, if not merely as
A boast, “There, see what I can do!” and a bragging challenge, plainly,
for France to go and fight? If we wait another twelvemonth, perhaps
Prussia will disband another hundred thousand, and thus reduce her army
to a manageable compass. But we would not take a mean advantage
of delay. Our counseſ is for war, for instant battle with the braggart.
Let us at once annihilate this Enemy to Peace. Let us crush this
ºquin-this Slaughterer of Schleswig--this Havocker of Hanover–
this Despoiler of Denmark—whom England feared to fight... A million
swords are ready to leap forth from their scabbards, and strike, for the
good cause. For populi, por Dei, it is the Nation's voice that clamours
now for War. France boldly calls for vengeance on the Brigand of
Berlin.”—Petit Braillard de Brest.
“We have confidence in stating that a feather serves to show the
way the wind is blowing, and we may state with equal confidence that
the feather in the j. which we may here .. shows that the
Gallic weather-cock is pointing now to War. This we think will be
apparent when we mention that on Tuesday last his Majesty the
| Lºrenok went out shooting sea-gulls, being, as is usual, attended by
which oc-
occasion of rash speculation, which is sure to end in ruin. Have our commercial
| readers reflected on the fact that Venus has been nightly visible of
his armourer, and the other gallant officers who form his corps de chasse.
The day's sport was devised that he “might get his hand in,” as
His Majesty, with some significance, remarked; and the fact that he
had done so was happily apparent when he returned to dinner with a
feather in his cap. Now, the Romans in their augury were often
flºº by a bird, and doubtless in the eyes of the historian of Casak,
this slain sea-gull has been viewed as a favourable omen. The Black
Eagle is assuredly a bigger bird, to hit, and there is little fear that,
after the practice he has had, the EMPERoR will miss the mark he
plainly now is aiming at.”—L'Incendie Provinciale.
“For our own parts we believe that there will not be War—for some
few months at any rate. It is however only prudent that all who live by
commerce should reflect, in this great crisis that war when it does come
brings paralysis to trade, and that stagnation for awhile is better than
late P Mythology will inform them of the strong tie which existed
between Venus and Mars, and they may learn from any schoolboy that
wherever Wenus went Mars was pretty sure to follow.”—Le Trembleur
| Financier.
“We would gladly count ourselves with those who still believe in
peace. Yet what are we to think of an appalling fact like this? Our
| readers are aware that our gallant GENERAL CHAssepot has been sent,
of course incognito and under a feigned name, upon a most important
| secret mission to Berlin. Arriving there at nightfall and in most com:
lete disguise, he was at once invited to a banquet at the Palace, and
|É. the privilege of sitting on the right hand of the King. Little of
much consequence transpired till the third course, when desiring with
his salad to partake of a roast chicken, the brave General was most
pointedly, as well as, most º º with the drumstick /
learly if the King had any real wish, for peace, he would have taken
special care to have excluded from his table so bellicose a viand.”—
| Petit Journal des Niais.
“Our readers, like ourselves, will be startled to observe that Rentes
fell yesterday no less than & below the previous quotation. The cir-
|cumstance becomes the more alarming from the fact that speculation is
| at present quite unknown upon the 'Bourse, the only persons who do
usiness at this continental crisis º:fide buyers for investment.
The only cause, as yet assigned for t remarkable d slon Was a
rumour that the EMPEROR, while dressing after a bathe, had twice
been heard to sneeze, and from this, it was assumed that, His Majesty
unhappily had caught a sudden chill, by which his valuable life might
haply º imperilled.”—Le Gobe-wouches de la Gironde.
NURSERY REIYMES.
Suggested by some recent letters to the “Times.”
HushABY, baby, sleep sound as a top,
While JANE goes and stares at that milliner's .
No doubt if you wake you will make a great squall,
But little she careth how loudly you bawl.
Sing a song of nursing: in the Park you’ll spy
Four-and-twenty hussies flirting on the sly;
While in their perambulators the children may be seen,
And if they tumble out of them they'll hurt their heads, I ween.
If she rides the high horse, and gives you her sauce,
Be sure that your nursemaid is cruel and cross:
If she’s rings on her fingers, and buyeth smart clothes,
She’ll bully your baby wherever she goes.
Pipsy Popsy had a great fall,
Pipsy Popsy made a great squall:
But Mamma's a fine lady, and trusts to her maid,
So poor baby will tumble again, I'm afraid.
New Ghost Melody.
A CRITIC speaks of “the apparition of a dramatic singer of such
indisputable promise as Miss MINNIE HAuck.” But is it not Miss
HAuck herself who is singing at Covent Garden? Why then startle
us with the idea that it is her ghost, and delude perhaps thousands in
search of a new sensation to go to the theatre, possessed with that
notion ? We do not doubt that a dramatic singing apparition would
draw immensely, if one could be engaged.
THE ENGLISH PRIMACY.
It cannot be denied that many holders of the see of Canterbury have
committed, at various times, various blunders; but at all events, it
must be true, that whatever his after-career may be, every new Arch-
bishop commences by succeeding.

but she has £e. somewhat selfish in this instance; indeed one of the
poets says of the valley in question, -
“This spot was built by Nature for herself,”
and as is usually the case with builders, she has looked after her own
comfort. Commend us to the corner houses these gentlemen secure for
their own inhabiting, they are generally snug. Landlords don’t drink
the worst wine in the house, as a rule. , About a mile further on is
the Wishing Gate. Here you may wish for anything you like, and
don't you wish you may get it. Mind and take what is called “The
Langdale Excursion,” it is the only journey in which the traveller
may safely “do the pikes,”—
“The two huge peaks,
That from some other vale peer into this.”
One is called Pike o' Stickle and the other Harrison Stickle. Pike's
easy to mount, but Harrison's ticklish. The Dungeon Ghyll New
Hotel is close by ; not a very inviting name, but the cells--we beg

providing for you, it woul ; waste of money; for they tell you so
much you don’t want to know, so much you know already, and so
much that they don't know themselves, but have learnt to believe in
from constant repetition. Mind and look out for Elterwater Tarn and
Loughrigg, on which spot WILSON wrote some exquisite lines, though
you can’t see them without a very strong glass.
Keswick is a pleasant little town, famous for its pencils, which are
made of plumbago, sounding like something good to eat; but it is, in
fact, §. more nor less than black lead, or to speak chemically,

crusty bread and butter, sardines, marmalade, and fresh river fish.

| Bassenthwaite Water is worth seeing too, and so is Skiddaw, a moun-
tain six miles from Keswick, and which you must ascend. From this
extraordinary place you can see, it appears to us, almost everything—
umfries and the Cheviots, Penrith and Helvellyn, Lancaster Castle
and the Isle of Man. On very clear days you can do what many
| politicians have striven in vain to do for many years—you can even
make out Ireland. Well might Wordsworth put it thus—
“What was the great Parnassus' self to thee,
Mount Skiddaw P’’
We repeat the last line emphatically—by all means mount Skiddaw.
The tourist, must also go to Lodore, where there is a capital hotel, with
a wonderful rush of waiters when a traveller arrives. So remarkable is
this that a famous poet has put it into rhyme, from which we extract a
small portion:—
“How do the waiters come down at Lodore ?

And rushing,
And crushing,
Striking and raging

To clutch at one's boxes
Like hounds upon foxes.
Around and around,
With many a bound,
Smiting and fighting,
Imploring, inviting,
Cringing, and bowing,
Declaring, and vowing.
And so never ending, but always descending,
Most anxious it seems to take you and your friend in,
All at once come a score, or it even seems more,
And that's how the waiters come down at Lodore.”
By all means go to Ulswater, at which place you may spend five or
six days, and as many pounds, to great advantage, and a mountain
stream which descends from the Great Dodd (no doubt an ancestor of
the notorious “ToMMY") should be seen to be appreciated. It is
called the Airey Force, and is a standing or rather running denial to
those Utopians who declare they require no police at the i.
THE SOLE CASUS BELLI.
QUIET people are continually being disquieted by rumours of war.
In the meantime a very simple but a very obvious question is “What
have the principal European nations got to fight about?” What does
any one nation want that any other nation has any real interest in not
letting it have? Russia wants Turkey. But united Europe can make
Russia keep the peace. NAPOLEoN THE THIRD, has raised his army from
400,000 to 800,000 fighting men, to one million and a quarter alto-
ether, and his navy to, if not above, a parity with that of England.
he only thing that there is any occasion of fighting for now in Europe
is tranquillity denied by monstrous armaments. There is no assignable
cause for any possible war but simple provocation, such as that which
is given by a man who stands with his fist clenched in the face of his
neighbours.

DR. JENNER, the Bishop elect of New Zealand, is said to be very
unpopular in Maori-land because of his Ritualist opinions. Nonsense
Considering how keen the new maniacs are for novelties in the Church,
we should say that if ever there was a case of the right man in the
right place, it is a Ritualist in New-Zeal-land.

unhappy men merited their fate.
MRS. PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HER, DAUGHTER.
MY DEAR DaughTER,
IT had been my intention to attend the Social Science Con-
[. at Birmingham, and not wishing to appear as a drone among
ees, I had written a paper that I hoped would convince my Sex—
(oh dear, I am always forgetting that we are to talk now of Two Sexes
of Man)—well, then, the sex of man to which I belong, that Mrs. Punch
has as much natural craving for Social Science and Stirring-up-your-
y
Neighbour in general, as the most ardent female (oh, dear, t s the
difficulty again!) reformers going.
Now, I must frankly confess, to you, my darling child, that if ever
your mother was proud of anything in her life it was of this said Paper,
which she thought would set her upon the same pinnacle of greatness
with those ladies—I beg .."; I meant to say those—how very
awkward it is—I really don’t know what to say—those—Bonn ET-
weakING creatures, then, whom Social Science delighteth to honour.
Yes, my paper possessed a general interest which I could but hope
would make up for its homeliness of treatment; not only did it appeal
to the whole Bonnet-wearing community, including Spoilt Women
- Flowers, Girls of the Period, N º Buttercups and Ol
Girls, but it appealed to that sex—to which I will simply say, for the
sake of avoiding all invidious distinctions, Mr. Punch and other young
ladies' papers belong !
You will remember, my Daughter, that when I first forsook my jam-
saucepans and spice-cupboards, in order to prepare your mind for
Society by a series of Letters, I declared myself a champion of the
Rights of Men; and I am still of the same opinion. I see the faults of
the Young Men of the Period, and deplore them, as any right-minded
would-be Mother-in-law must do—but I hope that I see the other side
of the question as well.
It struck me then that a Champion of the Rights of Both Sexes of
Man, like myself, could hardly take up a more fitting subject of inquiry
at the Social Science Congress than that of dinners.
Must I confess it, my 5.º. The man of the middle classes,
and indeed the married man of all ranks of life, who is not a diner at
clubs is *. an ill-fed, often an under-fed, and sometimes an
execrably fed creature. Now, nothing can be better than plenty of
education, or as a great authority has called it, Sweetness and Light,
but while the ladies—I mean the wearers of bonnets—at Birmingham
are attending to that branch of Social Science, let Mrs. Punch concern
herself with what is no less important than Sweetness and Light; viz.,
Digestion and Dinners.
At least so said Mr. Punch, though he forbade the attendance of his
wife at the Social Science Congress. A wife who is a mother, said
Mr. Punch, whether she be the mother of one or the Mother of Seven,
should not appear in public unless duty compels, so let the world be
benefited by your lucubrations in another way, and leave Brummagem
ºne, my love. Of course I obeyed, and I should never have married
Mr. Punch, unless with that intention, and thus it happens that I read
upwards. - - --
It is all very well to say that Mrs. Punch is a materialist, and an
enemy to asthetic progress; but let any hard-worked Person of either
sex, whose brains are worth anything, either to the world, his family,
or himself, spend a few days in the household of a dinner-despising
|wearer of bomets, and see what he is good for at the end of the time.
| No doubt, men are all monsters, more or less º JUDIANA; but
seeing how helpless they are in this matter, we should exercise - sort
of lofty pity, and keep up the poor gorillas' fire as the savages do, since
they cannot keep it up for themselves. -
| After all, who can say what these monsters might not have been, had
they been well fed from the time of the Conquest until now? and if we
do not bestir ourselves, we shall find the tables turned with avengeance
pretty soon, and the men, grown desperate, looking after the #.
in our place
i Sºlove and respect your father, my JudLANA, much as I
| sympathise with the universal cry for extension of privileges to both
sexes of Man, could I bear with equanimity the sight of my husband
making a pudding or doling out spices to the cook? Never, never!
|I should die under the mortification. -
Bestir yourself then, in the attainment of this branch of knowledge,
which is a sine quá non of an accomplished, Person of the sex to which
we both belong. Whilst encouraging all other pioneers in the right
direction, let us remember that the first duty of a woman—the forbidden
word, is out again—and a very noble duty too, is to insure the health,
working capabilities, and much of the happiness of future generations
|by providing not, merely good food, but the best food to be had for
our families. Why do not some benevolent personages offer prizes
and create scholarships in the Ladies' College that is to be for pro-
ficiency in these jº ? There might be—
The Beef-Tea Scholarship,
The Boiling Potato Prize,
The Pastry Gold Medal.
The Nursery Pudding Silver Medal
The Tea and Coffee Fellowship, and so on.
| Might not the more interesting, domestic pursuits take the place of
useless knitting, netting, and crochet, or sensational novel- g, Or
|endless scribbling of letters * , Whatever the world may say, hearken
to the words of your domestic but not benighted Mamma,
MRs. Punch.
How Very Happy :
The Bishop of CHESTER has delivered a *:::: attack upon
Ritualism. We wish the DEAN or WESTMINSTER would do the same
—nobody could do it better—and then we could quote SIR WALTER
gloriously—
“Charge, CHESTER, Charge ' On, STANLEY, on 1"
“AMONG THE POTs.”
THERE is one pot which MR. Douſton, the potter, declares he never
made—a pot de vin. The decision of the Court of Brussels shows that
pot-luck is not always good luck.

AN EPISODICAL NUMBER ARRANGED FOR TWO WOICES.
It is odd that, on going up to town with my Little Man with a #
Voice, in order to join my Big Man with a Little Voice, I shoul
happen to run against Tupton, the first species of the Voice genus.
As on this occasion I was favoured with an experience of him which I
had not previously had, it will be as well to mention it here, episodically,
and then get on. - -
Having stopped at the houses of both, I take this opportunity of
asking them to dinner at my club, and after that we would go to the
Opera. - -
I don’t think I shall ever do it again.
I belong to the Mausoleum Club. It takes, an undistinguished
person about forty years to become a member of it, and even then the
candidate's father has caused his name to be put down on the club list
immediately after entering him upon the district register of births, or,
at latest, in the church register of baptisms, and in all probability his two
godfathers will be his proposer and seconder at the Mausoleum. To
these worthy people the being a Mausoleum Man is one of the highest,
if not the highest, honour to be obtained in life. So great is their
veneration for the institution, that, I think, if LoRD, EBURY could
obtain a revisal of the Liturgy, they would move that the words
“when I was proposed as a candidate for the Mausoleum” be intro-
duced, in special cases, after the words “wherein I was made,” &c. in
goung would-be wits of minor clubs have said, be buried: but we are
buried alive; and what could be more pleasant, in the afternoon of

W. are (a few of us, perhaps) laid on the shelves, as is the fashion of
some countries, but being neither swaddled nor swathed, crib'd,

in as perfect a state and with as dignified
the Church Catechism. "In the Mausoleum we may indeed, as some

ing our morning-room roughly, would be awed by the calm and grave
deportment of our Senior Members. I am not supposing the barbarians
to come in when old HAwkER coughs, or the spell would be broken.
By a recent decision of our revered senators, meaning the Committee,
we have been allowed a smoking-room under the leads, and have also
been permitted to ask a guest to extend his legs under one of the small
mahoganies, thereto e and provided, in our new hospitium.
In the Mausoleum, even in our lofty smoking-room (alluding to the
height at which it is placed in the building) no Member addresses
another Member unless he has been duly introduced either within or
without its walls.
Self-introduction during a lonely journey, on the Continent is not
sufficient, nay, is even hinted at as a
of membership, and, among strict disciplinarians, as a ground of expul-
sion. For one Member to ask another “If he has finished with the
Times or Pall Mall Gazette "" is an extreme measure. The mode gene-
rally adopted being, if you are seated in the next chair to a Member
who is dozing over the paper you want, to ring the bell, and tell the
waiter to make the inquiry, not as your *śa: specially, but
appearing, as it were, for the rest of the Club.

unbend in the refectory. Here we fix on our meat like solemn blue-
bottles, buzzing between the courses, before we settle on a fresh dish.
That is, those who are not engaged in studying the Quarterly, or some
such light aid to digestion.
With our guests we are, perforce, more guarded, having the
character of the establishment to keep up. Hence, a loud tone is
never heard here. We dine sotto voce, as if we were broken up into
little knots of conspirators, each occupied with its own deep plot. We
give whispered orders, and draw our guests' heads together over the
cloth to point out celebrities—Members, of course—who are enter-
taining other celebrities at other tables. - -

both refusing. They accepted. They came. , TUPTON in great voice,
with some capital anecdotes he had just received from America: SILFoRD

I hear TuproN, as I descend our noble staircase, asking lº.
“Where shall I hang my coat ". ” The waiter will take it..., “Ah,

that my dinner will be a practical illustration of what the “Many have
told of the monks of old,” how they “laughed haſ haſ and quaffed

considered a poetic licence, and a physical impossibility without
choking.
“Ah, Tupton,” I say, pleasantly approaching, “that's capital;”, and
I am free to own that beyond intending to welcome him generally to
the Mausoleum, I don't know what I mean:

who was inspecting the plant before making a bid.

go up six steps, as a decoy elephant, and the monster follows me

“First time I’ve been here,” he tells me as an apology for stopping

Foolishly, on the score of the room being empty, I allow him the free
use of his voice. I have continual cause to regret this good-natured
laxity, as subsequently, it is impossible to explain to him why he may

whisper in a dining-room, where the dishes are expected to be seasoned
with conversation.

sent (for he is considerate), four bars of a new song for SANTLEY,

THE DEMONSTRATIVE CLASSES.
Now all men by the *
telegram from Madrid that:-
“The people burnt a scaffold
to-day on the public square where
executions have hitherto taken
place, as a demonstration against
capital punishments.”
We sometimes hear persons
intent on making merry say
that they will sing old Rose
and burn the bellows., What
fun there can be in burning
the bellows we cannot see, ex-
cept as much as there may be
in mischief when the bellows
that is burnt by anyone belongs
to somebody else. But burn-
ing the ows we can well
understand to be a high joke
for people, so to speak, accus-
tomed to be hanged. The
populace of Madrid, whilst
they burned the scaffold which
is their equivalent for a gal-
lows, perhaps also sang some-
thing tantamount to old Rose;
- - - possibly they sang old Rios
Rosas, if they didn't sing old GonzALEs BRAvo. -
Now the roughs, even, of England, not to say the people, are little
aggrieved by capital punishment, and, were a revolution unhappily to
occur in this country, the would not, although CALCRAFT is º:
unpopular, * º ink of burning the gallows. But in case of
any tumult, if the street, followers of MR. BEALEs were to get the
}. hand, it is very likely indeed that, by way of a demonstration in

Thank Evins I ain't one of them there Ritualist boys' mother!"
Folks sometimes talks of Mother Church as though of an old woman;
And them sons of the English apes the children of the Roman:
Wears coloured frocks with petticoats, fallals, fandangos-fiddle !
And—yah!—some on 'em too has their hair parted down the middle.

Their fumigatin’ censer, and their muffin-bell a ringin'.

Which, if the reg’lar dustmen's right, is but a vain endeavour,
And if they’re wrong it can’t be mare a bit o' use whatever.

Which to my life's end I shall cry, whoever tells me not to.

For all the world, like them things between birds and mice; them
atses;
Which some calls neither bird nor beast; in sayin' so they flatter:
Them creturs, as the former, flies; but is, in fact, the latter.
-
But whilst theirselves they crosses, and like Popish Priestes mutters,
None on 'em, mind you, quarrels with their precious bread-and-butters,
They all bides where they be, although to be at Rome they wishes:
For why? they can’t make up their minds to leave the loaves and fishes.
About my house I never would allow sitch chaps to lollop;
That set of hulkin’ fellers with a broomstick I would wallop.
They talk of patens, do they I’d let my old clogs fly at 'em.
Get out! I arm’t no patience with them jackanapeses—drat 'em.
EMANUEL AND HIS DOGs.
We read in Saturday's Standard a police report to this effect. One
HARRY EMANUEL, who lives in Pembridge Villas, Notting Hill, was
summoned for causing a nuisance by keeping a number of noisy dogs.
The complainant, a neighbour, stated that these beasts, bark, howl
and fight all night; a second neighbour stated that he had complained
to this EMANUEL in vain, and several other neighbours urged the
taking out the summons. Enºsugi, according to the report, does not
apologise, nºr at first promise to abate the nuisance, but his attorney
contended that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction. MR. DAYMAN,
however, crushing this objection, the ndant said he would remove
the dogs that made the noise. The complainant begged that an order
might be made, as his wife was very ill, and was much disturbed by
the noise, on which MR. DAYMAN made an order for the removal of
the dogs in seven days, and for the payment of two shillings costs. Then
EMANUEL's attorney applies for a “case” to enable him to *. and
it was granted. ell, is the sick lady to be annoyed by the yelling
beasts until the Superior Court decides whether her husband ought or
ought not to have brought a civil action against EMANUEL An indig-
nant husband might be tempted to abate the nuisance in another way,
and let EMANUEL bring his civil action; but it would be wrong to
yield to the temptation, of course, and Punch gives the hint in the
interest of the dogs.

TOUCHING.
“You SEE IT was A FUNERAL, AND. It war.N'T A FUNERAL. It was only A
BURRYING. We've Lost our LITTLE Dog TowsER, AND As I wouldN'T HAVE
HIM STUFFED LIKE his BRother, My Missus MADE ME PUT on WEEPERs As A
MARK o' RESPECT, MR. Jonas."
PAY MR. STUDD.
MR. STUDD, landowner, Epsom, owns a piece of the course on which the Derby
is run. He wants—he actually wants from the 3. who manage the races, a
large sum of money for leave to use his land, and declares that they shall not race
upon it unless they*: him.
This is simply and perfectly Monstrous, with a large M.
All that can be said in favour of a man who ventures to demand payment—as
much as he can f. too—for the rent of his quºn property is that he has been living
at Australia, and is unacquainted with British facts.
Does STUDD know that money is nobody’s object in England?
Is he not aware that nobody who goes to the Derby ever tries to get as much as
he can for anything that he can sell or let or dispose of:
Has nobody told him that the horses are run by their owners solely for the sake
of keeping up a noble breed, and of affording a jolly holiday to the people?
Can he be unaware that the betting men who use his land, aprarently for pur-
poses of business, are only at play, and that they never really make any profit by
that business?
Why is he so ignorant as not to be certain that the tickets for the Grand Stand,
and all the other stands, are given away; and that if he has seen money paid when
the cards are issued, it was only for charitable purposes? He cannot be so stolid
as to think that profit is made out of the Correct Cards that describe what is to be
done on his land. . . -
It is shocking to think of such ignorance; but it is his only excuse. Were we
the people who manage, the races, we would pay him what he certainly has a legal
right to demand, in the present, absurd state of the law of property, and thus
heap coals of fire on his hat, and raise the blush of shame upon his green veil.
And the sooner the better, for we cannot be all agitated upon the subject—that
anxiety and electioneering are too much for us. , Besides, if he is affronted further,
he may remember his Antipodean motto, “Advance, Australia!” and advance
his terms accordingly. Pay MR. STUDD.

Hoist your flag—let it bear,
As it spreads to the air,
A message of justice and peace
To i. Land in the West,
Where with Hope for her guest,
All tumult and faction shall cease.
Raise your cry—let it swell,
Like a trumpet, and tell
To all England expectant to-day,
That the † has begun,
In which right shall be done,
And ages of wrong roll away.
Choose your side—there are two—
Be on that which will do
More than all it has done in the past;
Give new strength to the State,
Make it happy as great,
And anchor the old Wessel fast.
Take your stand—in the van
Of an army who can
Show the palm, and the prize, and the crown;
Still with conquests to make,
Still with strongholds to take
Sure as death in the end to come down;
Marching up, marching on,
Past the heights they have won,
Other obstinate foes to assail:
Not a wrong unredressed,
Not a soul left oppressed,
When the future s oast of the tale:
Better laws, better times,
Fewer shames, fewer crimes,
Their trophies and triumphs to come;
Wise heads at the helm,
Knowledge blessing the realm,
And respite from cannon and drum.
Ask for help for the poor
Who now die at your door -
For the hind when the few shillings fail,
For the mendicant child,
Vicious, ignorant, wild,
Ready-made for the gallows and gaol.
Choose your man—let him be
The man whom we see
OnlyW. in the dawn of his fame;
ise, honest, and just,
The man we all trust
To lighten the land of a shame.
Give him power and place,
And England shall trace
Her annals in letters of light;
Give him numbers and strength,
And England at length .
Will feel she has come to her might.
With your vote and your voice,
Show the world by your choice
In County, and City, and Town,
That you know whom to send
That you know the true friend,
Of the State, and the Church, and the Crown.
Then for GLADSTONE unite,
Fly his flag in the fight,
As you charge in the glorious fray,
Sure all over to win, .
Sure to bring your men in,
And scatter the Tory array.
Ay! and thousands shall say—
“We are proud of the day
When we handselled the right of the free;
For we swelled the great roll
Of the host at the poll,
Who bore him to victory.”

LEADING ARTIcLE ON THE ELECTIONS.
- N accordance with
- - - - the usual and emi-
- nently useful prac-
tice of our contem-
poraries, we give a
lance at the list of
those whom the dis-
solution againsends
to the hustings, and
of those who ap-
Fº that plat-
orm for the first
time. Our remarks
may be severe, but
they are dictated by
our sense of duty to
the country, and the
man who at this
moment, fails to ex-
press himself with
tº courage and accu-
| racy on the coming
elections is un-
worthy the name of
- - a British politician.
- - - We own that the
- list, now daily sup-
s - plied to us, pre-
- - - sents on the whole
a satisfactory aspect, though it comprises many names which we could
wish to see absent, and many which will certainly be so in about a fort:
night. There are also a large number of candidates who, if elected, will
reflect credit on their constituents, though we do not know whether SIR
R. GLAss, at Bewdley, is a reflector or not...MR. Pond ER, Linlithgow, no
--- -
doubt reflects. Mr. TITE, Bath, is a sober statesman, and Colonel
Hogg will º: pigs to a fine market, Bath being famous for chaps.
MR. ANTHONY TRoLLope would not have offered himself for Beverley,
but that He Knew He was Right, and we know that he is a writer, and
a delightfulone. CAPTAIN SHERARD Os Bob NE, Birkenhead, having been
an iº. Alº. is just the man to get to the top of the Pole,
and we hope he will. orkshire jollity is proverbial, ...” the old city
has to choose between a GLADSTONE and a MERRYWEATHER, and we
hope that MILTON's Paradise will be Regained in the West Riding, south.
Northampton, also, has a MEREwetHER: “O, the Recorders. Let us see
one”—elected. Whether M.R.SPARK will go out at Darlington we are not
at present able to say, nor why MR. BACKhouse does not call himself
Bacchus, which is a pleasanter name, but he may be a teetotaller. We
hope that what MAJoR PALLISER heard in the Shell was success at
Devonport, and we are pleased that MR. H. B. SHERIDAN has no Rivals
at Dudley. The bad grammar of MR. LITTLER's name must exclude him
from Lambeth,and we know not whether M.R.S.ALMoN is a catch for New-
castle-under-Lyme. MR. ScourFIELD has scoured everybody else off the
fields of Pembrokeshire, but the due of MR. HERMON may or may
not be a seat for Preston. Sandwich may like MR. WoRMs, but we should
not like worms in a sandwich. MR. MARSH Nelson expects every man to
do his duty in Mid-Surrey, which signal he sets flying at MR. PEEK. Al-
though capital punishment is now private, we wish MR. CALCRAFT to sit
for Wareham, and MR. CREMER's doll warehouse has made so many dear
children happy that we wish him all luck at Warwick. We desire the
return in Westmoreland of LQRD BECTIVE because he rhymes to invective.
If SIR F. Lycett be rejected at Worcester, the relieving officer may say
Ire licet if that will comfort him, and in East Worcester, if the same
event occurs to MR. AMPHLETT he may write a pamphlet—we shall by
not read it, we believe. Why MR, VANCE stands on the Conservative
interest for Armagh when music-halls pay so well we know not; perhaps,
as he opposes M.R. Low, it is to show his liking for the genteel. MR.
VINCENT Scully is in two places at once, like an Irish bird, and we
fervently hope he will get in for neither Cashel nor Cork County, but
come an awful cropper between two stools. In Galway there are two
members and nine candidates, so there ought to be a howling, good
fight, but we should like LoRD St. LAwRENCE to come in, while the
Irish Church is in question, because at St. Lawrence in the Isle of
Wight the Church is reduced to a minimum. If DR. WILLIAM
Russell comes in for Chelsea, there will be no need of DR. BRADy’s
return in Leitrim. . ColoneL Totte NHAM may be a worthy man, but
he would remind us too much of squalid Tottenham Court Road for us
to wish him elected for New Ross; nor, liking large measures, do we
desire to see MR. GILL in for Tipperary, unless he sounds his name
with the hard initial. If we have objected to MR. WoRMs, what can
we say for MR. GRUBB, at Waterford? Can he not change his name
to that of MR. PAPILLóN, who does not seem to be standing, and MR.
CRUM-Ewing at Paisley will also oblige us much by altering his, unless
he thinks crumb hewing easier work than crust cutting, which he would
if he had eleven hungry healthy children to cut bread for every morn-
ing and the knife as blunt—but we wander. We have said º to
indicate the constitution of the new Parliament, and at least we have
been as practical and instructive as any similar summary which we have
yet had the misfortune to peruse.
POLICE INTELLIGENCE.
It is understood in the best areas that the next things to be seized
are the Perambulators. Their freights and attendants will be confis:
cated, and disposed of to pay the expenses of detention, if not claimed
within one week from the time of capture.
Great inconvenience having been caused by the strings attached to
the kites boys are in the habit of flying in the parks and other public
places, the Police have had strict orders to take down all these aerial
machines, and deposit them with the Meteorological Department of
the Board of Trade. If necessary, they are to form a cordon round
the parks, to prevent the escape of the delinquents.
In consequence of numerous complaints that have been made at
Scotland Yard, all toy-carts, carriages, railway-engines, waggons, &c.,
are prohibited from being drawn on the public pavement, unless in
charge of the family footman or upper nursemaid. -
Foot passengers having been seriously incommoded by the increased
dimensions of certain popular favourites, the maximum size allowed for
Dolls when carried out of doors, may be learned on application to the
Chicf Commissioner, Whitehall Place, S.W. N.B.-A licence must be
obtained, before any doll can be allowed to speak.
A WOICE FROM THE HUSTINGS.
(To the Crowd below.)
FREE and independent Electors of Great Britain, and Ireland
What do you think the London University's Annual Committee of
Convocation has done? ... Issued a Report “on the most appropriate
mode of conducting the Election of a Representative in Parliament”
for the University of London, wherein they declare, that they “think
it undesirable that,” before the result of the election is known,
“speeches should be made by either the proposers or seconders of can:
didates or by the candidates themselves.” What an insult, free and
independent Electors, this declaration is to you ! It is bad enough for
the fastidious old University of Öxford to affect to say that there
shall be no speechifying of candidates for its representation, and
thus to affect to be superior to the influence of that declamation which
excites the impulsive masses. But for the young, popularly consti-
tuted, London University to give itself such supercilious airs as to
announce that it will not be harangued as you are, is to treat you with
contempt. .
What, too proud to cry, “Who stole the donkey ** above shouting,
“How's your poor feet?” “Does your mother know you’re out?”
“Shut up!” and “Go home!”: , So fine as to be incapable of hissing
and hooting and screaming “Yah!” or of hurling a few dead domestic
animals or stale eggs at an unpopular orator's head? Is this the
character affected ; the London University ? Then let those aristo-
cratic beggars know what you think of them; for they have unmis-
takeably declared what they think of you.
SOMETHING WILICH WENT THE ROUND OF THE PAPERS.
LoNDON, reasonably alarmed at the prevalence of assaults,burglaries,
robberies in the day-time, and other acts of lawlessness, heard, with
immense satisfaction, that the successful result of a new order issued
SIR. Richa Rd MAYNE was, that there were to be found “at the
different police-stations in the Metropolis thousands of ’’—as London,
not unfairly, hoped and expected—burglars, garotters, and thieves, or,
at the least, street beggars, tramps, and impostors, London was a
little disappointed at finding that the occupants of the police stations
were “thousands of boys and girls;” for, although glad to think that
the streets would be cleared of an army of dirty young mendicants and
pilferers, it would have preferred to be rid of the adult rascal and
ruffian. But London, was filled with amazement and ridicule, in equal
Joroportions, when it discovered that the thousands in detention at the
police-stations were “thousands of boys' and girls'-hoops!” –
Worse and Worse.
MR. Punch lately remarked on the suspicion that must be felt as to
the previous career of Candidates who announced themselves to be
“unfettered.” But what must be thought of a Candidate who appeals
for support on the ground that he is a “tried” Member
SoNG for MAGISTRATEs.-“Let us speak of a man as we’ve fined
him.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SERIOUS SPORTING-MAN.
MR. PUNCH,-Your contempo-
rary, the Record, and your other
contemporary, the Guardian,
much as they may, differ on
some points, will probably º
in taking the same view of an
example of Turf momenclature
which occurs in a letter o
ARGUs under the title of Sport-
ing Intelligence in the Morning
Post. Indeed, Sir, I dare say
that not only all the denomina-
tional papers and periodicals
will, on that one matter at least,
be quite unanimous, but that
almost the whole of the re-
spectable secular press, will
concur with , them. ... Simply
chronicling the particulars of a race at the Lincoln Autumn Meeting,
ARGUs thus writes :--
“Such a ‘crucifying’ day backers have not experienced this season, as only
one race out of seven was carried off by the favourite, and the layers of odds
in that instance, on the Crucifixion filly, had a near squeak for their money,
as CANNoN only just managed to * in DR. Short House's filly a neck
before the roaring Conrad. . e Doctor subsequently named his filly
• Atonement,’ and, though treading on dangerous ground, perhaps, con-
sidering the ecclesiastical locality where she underwent christening rites, it
foreshadowed a turn of luck to the gentlemen on the last day, when the
favourites made ample atonement to their backers by carrying all before them.”
Now, Mr. Punch, I expect that the majority of your decent con-
temporaries, and indeed of their readers, will be down upon DR.
Shorthouse for giving his filly the names above specified. But, Sir,
permit me to point out that they will be greatly mistaken if they
suppose that those names were bestowed on that animal in any spirit
of conscious irreverence. Let it be considered that the application,
by a racing-man, of such names to a horse, proceeds from no want of
respect for them. You know, Mr. Punch, there are names of Colleges
both at Oxford and Cambridge of just the same kind as those which
DR. Short House conferred on his mare. A man, Sir, of DR. SHORT-
House's species esteems a horse at least as highly as a college. If he
regards the latter as a noble institution, he accounts the former,
perhaps, a still more noble animal. He thinks no name can be too
ood for a horse, and, in giving one any appellation such as a pious
ounder might, with acknowledged propriety, assign to a seat of
learning, may be supposed to be influenced by the same feelings as
those which actuated a Fox and an Alcock in naming their several
foundations. In short, Mr. Punch, the truth may be presumed to be
that DR. ShoBTHouse is simply a serious sporting gentleman, accus-
tomed to name his stud by words not in general employed unneces-
sarily, in perfect gravity. All else that can be said is that perhaps
he may be chargeable with a slight excess of horse-worship. As an
exponent of the stable mind, allow me, Mr. Punch, to spell myself,
TCLCQCLK.

We are authorised to state that the Right Reverend DR. ColeNsq

MR. MAC RoARIE will be consecrated by DR. GRAY at the Cape, and
sent on to fill the see of Natal, thus vacated, and by these means the
Premier will happily heal all the discords in the Church.
A GREAT IMPROVEMENT.
SIR. Richard MAYNE’s last edict has had one good effect. It has
put an end to that absence of the Police when wanted so often com:
plained of, for now they are always ready to “come with a hoop and
come with a call.”
MR. Mowbray’s best recommendation to a good many Oxford
voters—The Bray in him.
EXPOSITION OF THE LORD MAYOR ELECT.
. ON Monday last was performed an annual solemnity, in the estima-
tion of our French friends, doubtless, as many as have heard about it,
of tremendous importance. The Lord MAyoR Elect was, according
to usage, presented and described (with the help of a wand perhaps)
to the form Cºncil on by the REcoRDER. The idea of a meeting
between two such Lords must needs be overwhelming to the imagina-
tion of Continental believers in the Great Lord Mayor; only they
f|probably consider that, with due regard to relative dignity, the cere-
mony ought to be inverted, and the Lord CHANCELLOR presented
to the LQRD MAYor. Be that as it may, in the course of the grave
chaff which, the permanent Law Lord customarily addresses to the
temporary Civic one, LoRD CAIRNs observed, referring to conceivable
i.e. with the rights and privileges of the Corporation of
Orloton :-
. . There is but one circumstance which could lead to any danger to those
rights and privileges, and I may be allowed to mention it. That danger
would lie where, if there should be matters with respect to which the Corpo-
º be required to adjust itself to the requirements of the times,
essentially different from those in which they had their origin, there should
be any failure of the Corporation to amend and adapt itself.”
This is high and courteous chaff; stately and dignified official banter.
Translated into the vernacular of familiar and undisguisedly contemp-
tuous intercourse, the gist of it would run thus:—“I’ll tell you what
it is, my Lord Mayor of London Elect, and Aldermen; there’s no fear
that your rights and privileges will be interfered with, except in one
case. Do you want to know what that is ? Then I’ll tell you. If
you choose to go to work and reform all your antiquated abuses up to
the mark of the present day, well and good; but if you don't do that
thoroughly forthwith yourselves, the Legislature will very soon do it
for you. You had better set your Mansion House in order now of your
own accord, or else you will shortly have it set in order without your
assistance.”
A PLUMPER FOR ROEBUCK.
MR. PUNCH,
F course, Sir, you are aware that the constituency of
#not
O
Sheffield includes a considerable number of accessories after
before the fact for which MR. BRoad HEAD was not hanged. You
know, also, that these fellows, from sympathy with BRoaphe AD and
his accomplices, and because of the part taken by MR. Roebuck in
dragging their deeds to light as a Trades Unions Commissioner, intend
to oppose MR. Roebuck's re-election. In reference to the possibility
of losing his seat, in the speech delivered at a meeting of his consti-
tuents, MR. Rorºuck is reported to have said, after having reminded
them that he had been before the public and in Parliament for six-and-
thirty years:--
“Am I now, in my old age, to be sent back with contumely, as if I had
done nothing in my day worthy of regard : Is there not something in it, Sir,
shocking to our nature, our common sense, and common justice?”
|
If the Broadheadites succeed in turning out MR. Roebuck, then,
about the most honest man that ever sat in the House of Commons since
|ANDREW MARVELL, will have been rejected by a majority of the
Sheffield electors. Honesly will be in a minority at Sheffield. The
most fit and proper person to, represent that borough will then he
BRoadh EAD, and the mext will be CRookes. MR. DFIELD will,
therefore, of course retire, if he be not also rejected, in order to make
room, if not for CRookEs, for somebody equally fit with CRookes to be
the colleague of BROADHEAD, or the representative who may be
chosen in BROADHEAp's place, for want of }. But no, Sir,
| Sheffield is not the Sawgrinders' Union; and we may trust that our
friend John ARTHUR will find the blades of Sheffield as true as steel.
Yours, &c., SIMON PURE.

savagery of its political parties, the corruption of its municipal elections

now warning that in a short time they will be cut off. The persistent
efforts of Mr. Punch and others to arouse public opinion on the sub-
ject, have brought forth very good, though tardy, fruit. Last Thurs-
d
h
ay, the Marylebone Vestry, the most intelligent of all the vestries,
eld a meetin , and PROFEssoR MARKs, one of the most able vestry-
men, proposed certain resolutions for the Protection of Society against
our poor friend, the Street-Ruffian. In brief, these were to the effect
that something must be done, and must be done at once, and that the
other vestries be asked to join in a deputation to the Home Secretary,
to urge the doing. The spirit in which the interests of the Street-
Ruffian are to be cared for may be gathered by him, and by the public,
from the following passage in the Professor's speech:--
“Although it seldom occurred that offenders met with punishment beyond
what they deserved, yet, for deeds of violence, the punishment was often
absurdly inadequate—so absurd, indeed, as often to induce the criminal to
laugh at it. ey would recollect that three years ago no crime was more
rife than garotte robbery; and after it had defied almost every, mode of
punishment, it occurred to the Legislature that it might be advisable to try
the lash. They knew that the lash had been applied in but very few instances,
and yet nothing had had so great an effect in reducing garotting. He could
not help thinking that if for other dastardly assaults it were permissible to use
flagellation, they would have far less of them. The brutal ruffian was almost
y nature a coward, and feared most that bodily t + - he so ruthlessly
inflicted upon others.”
Exactly what Mr. Punch has been saying, in type and in F. for
the last ten years, and therefore he need not express his hearty con-
currence in the sentiment. MR. HARDY will not be in office ºf
enough to assist, officially, in the matter, but we are sure that he wi

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ODD MEN OUT.
AN EPISODICAL NUMBER ARRANGED FOR TWO WOICES.
(CoNTINUED.)
FROM its commencement I try to make the dinner at the Mausoleum
as short as is consistent with our reputation, as a club, for hospitality.
TUPTON has some first-rate stories, which in such a place as our dining-
room should be narrated auricularly, not oracularly. I look up from
my plate cautiously. We are the only table talking. I beg him not to
speak quite so loud. He takes it in very good part, and says in an
ordinary voice he was not aware that he was making any noise. In a
few minutes, getting into an argument with SILFoRD as to whether it
is Otello or Jºo who has the grand duett with Desdemona, he not only
rises with his subject, but puts on “the full stop,” in an organic sense,
to such an extent as to positively cause a vibration among the glasses.
To remonstrate now is impossible, at least without shouting at them,
for SILFord, finding Tupton will insist upon misquoting an air, must
needs raise his basso by way of correction. Had we been dining in a
robber's cave the noise couldn’t have been worse. I frown, I shake my
head: it’s no good; they understand my pantomime as a sign of my
taking part in their confounded Babel (if there can be a Babel of two)
of a discussion, and disagreeing with them both. I shall have the credit
of having introduced drunken men into the club. I see the Rev. M.R.
PRYM, Master of a College, with two clerical guests. I nod to him as
an acquaintance, and shrug my shoulders as much as to intimate (so as
to bring him in as evidence afterwards if this is made a committee case)
that I have nothing to do with this row, and would stop it if I could.
There is not time enough to have coffee and a cigar in the smoking-
room; so we go at once to the Opera. We have three stalls. Seein
what a combination they effected at dinner, I separate them now, an
place myself between them. A boyish playground rhyme occurs to me
àpropos of my present situation—
Hi diddle diddle,
Fool in the middle.
There are some days when we are not wise. This, then, is one of my
unwise days.
The Opera is Lucrezia Borgia. We all three know it well. I know
it, generally; that is, I couldn't
making it more mysterious than it is.
airs, nor the exact order in which they occur. But Lucrezia is a
favourite of mine; and, what I have always called “the scene with the
Duke” (that is, where Lucrezia exhibits some tenderness towards Gen-
naro, and is caught at it by her husband), I have invariably quoted, as
affording grand scope for acting. If asked to place a §. meaning
on this phrase, I should be had at a disadvantage. SILFoRD knows
the opera musically; TUPton knows it historically; that is, opera-
tically-historically, and I dare say is not very correct in his facts.
When we enter the house, ushered in by a stall-keeper, SILFoRD is
humming “Il segretto,” and TUPTON is looking to see, as he says, in
his usual tone, “where the deuce his stall is P’’
He commences by indicating three as ours, and immediately get-
ting into the wrong row, from which he is beckoned out by the stall-
keeper, who puts us in 90,91, 92. “I’m 91,” I say, ereupon
Tupton, who has had quite as much of the Mausoleum Champagne as
is good for him, exclaims, “Ninety-one, eh? Very well preserved for
your age; ” which is only tittered at by a few ladies, behind their fans, in
the next seats, whom TUPTON hasn’t to Fº and upon whose toes he is
not treading. His progress to his stall is the cause of envy, hatred,
and malice, and all uncharitableness in those whom he has to incon-
wen lence. -
When seated, he says, “What a nuisance getting to one’s seat is!”
with which sentiment ail, who hear it, cordially agree. So here I sit,
hoping that now, at all events, while those who are paid to make a
noise are making their noises, these two amateur noise-makers will for
awhile be quiet. The Man with a Voice, first species, is on my right;

Hereupon TUPTON, in a stentorian and indignant tone, protests that
he is not talking louder than I am, and that it is SILFoRD who is
attracting public attention by his confounded humming. SILFoRD is
at this moment contentedly following Lucrezia in her grand “Scene
with the Duke.” He interrupts himself, to discuss the point warmly
with TUPTON, both leaning across in front of me. The Act-drop falls.
I quit my place, on the pretence of saying “How d'ye do?” to a lady
in a box, and I do not return again. I fully expected to see in next
day’s paper, under the heading BOW STREET-
‘JAMEs GEORGE TUPTON, describing himself as,” &c., &c., “was
brought up before MR. BEEK, charged with assaulting SAMUEL PRAT, a
stall-keeper at Her Majesty's Theatre,” &c., &c.

now, and talk of each other as “a fellow who doesn’t know how to
behave in public.”

The United States have done well to choose a Ulysses to preside

but because, considering the plague of office-seekers in Washington,
there is great need of one who has had previous experience of ridding
a house of suitors.

A WORD FOR A PATRIOT.
MR. PUNCH has ever a tear of compassion for the afflicted, and he
proposes to weep with his friend MR. PETER TAYLOR, of Leicester, if
convenient to that gentleman. Among the candidates for Chelsea was
MR. ODGER, working-man. It became a question whether M.R.ODGER
or SIR HENRY HoàRE should retire from the contest, and this ques.
tion was referred, by consent of both, to, three umpires, whose ex-
tremely radical views made it certain that they would be guided only
by consideration of the interest of Liberalism. . When MR PUNgh
names them, it will be seen that they are out-and-out Liberals. MR.
STANspeLD, MR. Tom Hughes, and MR. PETER TAYLOR aforesaid
were the three. They decided that MR. ODGER should retire. He did;
but, in the following gracious speech to an artisan meeting, signified his
discontent:-
“No doubt the working-men, had been insulted by what had taken place.
A blow had been dealt to the Liberal party; and, although he was as faithful
to the Liberal party as any man could be, he was not faithful to every limb of
it, because he §§ there was a rotten limb behind it. (Hear, jº
The Chairman, a MR. NIEAss, was still more explicit.
“It was the old story over again—that working-men acted with undue
faith in those whom they considered they might trust. . (Hear, hear.) They
had been too honest and too confiding in the class whic had no sympathy
with working-men. (Hear, hear.)”
MR. PUNCH has nothing to say about the decision—of course it was
impossible for three men to be honest Liberals, and yet to believe that
an enormous constituency, comprising not only a t mass of the
wealth and education of London, but a variety of interests requiring
the attention of a Member with leisure as well as skill, might be more
conveniently represented than by a working-man, however intelligent.
But the cruel charge of, want of sympathy! MR. STANsfeld is a
statesman, and can afford the taunt, and ToM Hughes has done so
much for the artisan class that he can laugh at the accusation. But
we fear that it may damage our friend PETER TAYLOR at Leicester;
and we sorrow with him enormously, and sincerely trust that at the
eleventh hour no opponent may start up, and deprive the House of
PETER’s solemn yet fervid oratory, profound wisdom, and sparkling
epigram... We cannot spare our PETER TAYLoR, and we shall be very
vexed with Leicester if it avenges ODGER on him. Banish patriotic
PETER and banish all the world. -
THE FIGHT FOR FINSBURY.
The men of Finsbury have resolved, to pay all MR. Tonkens's
election expenses. This is a fitting tribute to a worthy man and a
useful legislator. ALDERMAN Lusk, we believe, pays his own, which is
equally fitting, not to say necessary, for if we were a Finsbury elector
we would stand on our head on “Finsbury Pavement” before we would
subscribe a shilling to help a man who “didn't think much of the Elgin
;
Marbles,” and then we wouldn't... We don't think much of Albekman
Lusk, in fact we never think of him at all, except when obliged, as we
were by having to speak of the other, and excellent candidate, MR.
ToBRENs. If our old friend and enemy Cox licks Lusk, we don't know
that we shall go into ..";
bury ought to be represented by Somebodies, but we never heard that
Cox sneered at the Elgin Marbles—so for Cox we'll raise our vor, and
into Lusk we’ll run our tusk. Hooray!
An Example to Ritualists.
The newspapers have announced that the Rev. J. Montesquiku
BELLEw is . to be received into the Church of Rome. In the
words of Hamlet, says Mr. Punch to Mr. PURCHAs, “I would you
were so honest a man?”
They are both Nobodies, and Fins.

ELECTION
ITEMS.
N the week ending Novem-
ber 21, 1868, the Inquisi-
tion with all its terrors
was set up in England—
so future historians will
record. Pressure was
brought to bear all over,
and the screw vigorously
applied. , Many men of
good birth, education, and
fortune, were put to the
question, and tortured past
endurance and luncheon
time, openly in Market
Places, Town Halls, and
other public resorts, in the
presence of the clergy and
ministers of all denomina-
tions, who far from inter-
fering to save the victims
from suffering, at times
added to their torment. The
Government whip was not
forgotten, and the “boot.”
of the Irish Church mer-
cilessly worked. Men were
on the rack for hours ; they
were badgered, baited, and
trapped, and some went
away from the scene of tor-
ture hopelessly fettered for
years to come. One poor
man, quite young, could
hardly reach his i., § SO
prostrate and exhausted
was he, all through an ex-
- - traordinary combination of
Bishops in the House of Lords, deceased wives' sisters, married couples
in workhouses, garotters, life peers, Protestant Dissenters, Ritualists,
teetotallers, Trades' Unionists, compound householders, litish Deans,
female yoters, Fenians, public school-boys, and street Arabs. He
declared that he had also been interrogated as to his opinions upon
Latin verses, open spaces, fancy bread, undergraduates' dinners, #:
distress prevailing amongst the purveyors of “canine provisions,” the
surrender of Gibraltar, and the November star-showers. Another
victim sat up the whole of the night before he was led out to the
Hustings, at his, inn in, a , Scotch Burgh, where fortunately the
whiskey was all that could be desired, trying to master the Law of
Hypothec; and in Wales several aspirants bound themselves to the
Atlas-like task of removing Monmouthshire from the Map of England.
Some speakers had to face the vegetarian question when cabbages
lightly touched their whiskers, and in more boroughs than one rabbits
introduced the *; of Game Laws.
Many youthful Candidates, who relied principally on their family
connection with Thisborough and Thatborough, made the farce com-
plete by having a prompter at their side when it was their turn to
s ; others were observed to look anxiously into the crown of their
hat-the crowd all the while very desirous to have it from them.
The usual platformitudes were spoken. All the forms were gone
through, but some unlucky men never found their seats again. Many
young fellows lamented their imperfect education, when they found |
themselves unable to explain to BERTHA, and CARA, and MARt. ARET,
the exact meaning of such expressions as hustings, scot and lot, pot-
wallopers, freemen, forty-shilling freeholders, faggot votes, knights of
the shire, pocket boroughs, &c.
The show of hands was as liberal and dirty as ever. -
. The ladies, not in the least troubled by all, Bowllſ, and BYLEs had
been saying of them, displayed their usual beautiful colours, and
seemed a little disa ãº at the Returning Officer not appearing
in orm, nor could they make out to what regiment he be onged.
Perhaps they thought more of the Candidates' looks than their yiews
and although not generally partial to statistics, they were delighted
with many of their figures, one or two cases of incompromising
wigs, the state of the poll was not considered, satisfactory. When
the speakers treated (thereby breaking the law) the electors to equalisa-
tion of the poor-rates, county, financial boards, Regium Donum, &c.,
the ladies exercised the franchise ":; the Court of Common Pleas,
and voted them a bore; but on the whole they received the addresses
of their favourite Candidates with marked approval and pocket-hand-
kerchiefs. The gentlemen who proposed were in high favour, and per-
haps to the ladies the most interesting event of all was—the Declaration.
A great many votes were split, and a few heads.
Special Trains ran, and so did Special Constables.

“Sigh no More, Ladies: Ladies, Sigh mo More.”
AN indignant “advocate of her sex” writes to us, denouncing ºr

plaining especially of that ungallant orgah for having dared to call the
claim of ladies to vote at common law, a “mare's nest.” . . . . . .

- BRUTAL TREATMENT OF A FENIAN
PRISONER.
WELL may the Fenians raise the cry against
the Saxon tyrant. Read the Cork Herald:—
“MRs. MACKAY, the wife of “CAPTAIN"
MACKAY, the Fenian convict, has had two in-
terviews with her husband in Millbank Prison.
She seemed well satisfied with the treatment her
husband was receiving. MACKAY was comfortably
clad, and had become so stout that she did not re-
cognise him until he spoke.”
Here is a theme for the Fenian Press in
America:—“The brutal wretches who have
incarcerated our patriots, cram them, like
turkeys, until their glorious and godlike
figures are destroyed, that they may hold
them up as ludicrous monsters of obesity.
But we tell the haughty. Saxon that, when
we regain our hero, we will soon starve him
down into heroic mould ; and when he comes
with banner, brand, and bow, as leader seeks
his mortal foe, the Governor of Millbank
shall expiate, on coals of fire, the tyrannic
cookery which has fattened our Mackay.”

MR. GLADSTONE A PAPIST.
MR, PUNCH never had the slightest doubt that Ma. GLADsroNE was
a Papist. But as less acute persons than Mr. Punch appear to be just
now much exercised on the subject, and keep on writing letters to MR.
GLADSTONE and the papers about it, Mr. Punch begs leave to submit
the following irrefragable proofs of the Roman Catholicism of the next
Premier. After this, surely no more need be said.
Mr. Punch knows that MR. GLADSTONE is a Papist,
BECAUSE, even in his family circle, he has never been heard to call the
Church of Rome a Scarlet Lady, or to propose the toast, “Bad
End to the Pope l’’ -
BECAUSE, when a Shoe-black of the S.V.P. brigade once asked him ſo
have his shoes “shined,” though MR. GLADSTONE hypocritically
refused the young Papist's services, he gave him a penny.
BECAUSE he never fastens his letters with wafers. His adulators say
that this is because gummed envelopes are gleanlier and more con-
venient; but we know better. It is out of respect to the Wafer
used by the Church of Rome, . - - - - -
BECAUSE the hair at the top of his head is thinning... Naturally, say
his defenders. Out on them! We know that in the most secret
and artful manner he has a few hairs taken out every day, with a
view to an ultimate imitation of the tonsure.
BECAUSE he destroyed the Italian prisons, that were full of priests’
victims. This was because the scandal of the system was injuring
the Papacy, which he sought to conserve.
Because he never lets off fireworks from his balcony in Carlton House
* on Guy Faux Day, nor gives money to the boys with
uys,
BECAUSE MRs. GLADSTONE is always doing acts of charity to the poor,
as notoriously enjoined by the Church of Rome, as proofs of faith.
BECAUSE he has translated several Protestant hymns into Latin, to
make them resemble Popish hymns.
BECAUSE he frequently makes quotations from Pope, who, besides
having such a name, was a Catholic.
BECAUSE he is not a subscriber to the Record or the Rock.
BECAUSE he does not intend to offer very high office to MR. WHALLEY.
BECAUSE DR. MANNING, long before he went over, * been god-
father to a son of Mr. Öinstone, he did not, on the Doctor’s
oing over, procure a private Act of Parliament for disestablishing
e sponsorship. - - - - -
BECAUSE if there is fish at his dinner on Fridays (as there usually is,
mark), he generally takes some.
|
BECAUSE his brother-in-law, SIR, STEPHEN GLYNNE, notoriously lives
in a castle that belonged to Roman Catholics for several hundred
. . . years.
BECAUSE he has never becn known by his family, when at table, and
there was mutton, to .P. a desire to eat the Pope's Eye.
BECAUSE with Diabolical and Jesuitical art he has always declared and
proved himself a devoted supporter of the Church of England, and
this alone, to any “truly Protestant” mind, M.R.GIADSTONE's
evil character being considered, would be—and indeed seems to
be- sufficient proof that he who will be Premier at Christmas is a
bigoted Papist.
N.B. The abore may be reprinted by any Protestant Association,
JOHN BULL TO JOHN BRIGHT.
My eloquent JoHN BRIGHT, your denunciation’s strong,
But more potently would smite your satire's stinging thong,
If for guidance of its might, you’d take this with you along—
That you aren't always right, your opponents always wrong;
That *: ºtius worth a whiffare, though they lead between two
stools;
That sails for the state-skiff are, without ballast, dangerous tools;
That dull folks' backs get stiffer, the more you call them mules;
And that men from you may differ, yet be neither rogues nor fools;
That 'twixt argument and reason wise men two ways may decide;
That to ride slow there’s a season, and a season fast to ride;
That to truth it is no treason, both eyes to open wide,
One that things their Darkside sees on, and one on their Brightside.
Too Bad.
THE Brigands, a week or so ago, took off MR. CAMPBELL, Vice-Rector
of the Scotch College in Rome. MR. CAMPRELL was returned by the
brigands, on compulsion, safe and sound. Now what was the ºbser:
yation of the Times Correspondent on this matter P. Why, will it be
believed, an unfeeling pun; he actually wrote to the leading Journal tº
say that “Brigandage in this province is not killed, though Scotched,
e shouldn’t ha’ thought it of him.
ExTREMEs MEET.—So did MR. BRIGHT and the Gun Trade.

WE’RE GUY ON'Y ONE BUCKET. At SHAviN' TIME, so WE’ve All Got To DIP our RAzoks IN

A CABBY QUESTION.
MR. PUNCH,-SIR, - -
BEING attached to a public vehicle, I trust I am not abusing
the licence granted to individuals of my stamp in conveying to you my
ideas on a subject of Fº political importance. My shafts may not be
so pointed or satirical as yours, but they are much more irritating, and
when chewing my oats, I often think of SHARspEARE's familiar line,
“Let the galled jade wince,” and fancy he must have had in his fine
poetic eye a London cab-horse like myself, with wheels behind wheals.
Although by habit identified with the party of progress, my instincts
are purely Conservative. I have great respect for our Prime Minister,
because, he has succeeded (which I have not) in raising himself from
the ranks. Looking at his new Reform, Bill from my stand-point, I
heartily approve of that clause in it which prºhibit; cabs from being
employed for electioneering purposes. Well do I remember what
sufferings I endured to bring in the popular candidates at the last
election. I was completely run off my legs, and compelled to strain
my sinews in a cause which I conscientiously detested. It is yery sin-
gular that Blues as a rule carry, more weight than Buffs, which can
only be accounted for by Dublin Stout having a greater specific gravity
than spirits-and-water. Those who stand up for our “glorious consti-
tution” know well what generous support it derives #. malt and
hops scientifically combined, and, they generally fortify themselves
. before they start for the hustings. en of stable minds
despise toddy.
I presume, Mr. Punch, that you are hand and glove with the Govern-
ment Whip? Be so good, then, as to ask him, in order that the Cabby
question may have a Čabinet answer, as cabs are scratched for the
approaching race between DISRAELI and GLADSTONE, whether sedan-
chairs are legal conveyances *
I am not at all clear on this point, for as no Act of Parliament, I am
told, was ever framed, but a coach-and-four could drive through it, I
should be surprised if, in one that has been more tinkered than, an
: a loophole could not be found wide enough to admit a wheel-
arrow.
In any event, Reform must be a boon to the working-horses of this
. Metropolis, whose energies are now relieved from an oppressive
poll-tax.
I hate agitation, and think that many of our parliamentary leaders
require curbing. There is far too much play about their heads, and
their mouths are not near so tender as they should be.
You are aware that I am an humble votary of the Mews, and I beg
therefore to subscribe myself by my nom de plume,
Very truly yours,
Whetstone Park, Lord Mayor's Day. AURORA FLOYD.
A ROCK CRYSTAL.
WE would give, a small sum — say the worth of the Cabinet's
chance of life—to be so near MR. DISRAELI as to be able to see hi
face when he sees (as he will see for the first time when reading his
Punch) the following conclusion of an article in which, one of the
“religious” papers commends him to the battle, as Achilles dismissed
Patroclus, with a prayer, to the fight in which he fell:—
“May the great Protestant statesman who is now piloting the vessel of the
State under Providence in a dangerous sea and amidst Rocks of peril (we do
not allude to ourselves) trust not merely to human foresight however clear, or
to i. however gifted, but like the wise mariner who pilots his barque b
looking for guidance to one fixed star above him, so may MR. DISRAELI loo
to that Great Light above him which never leads astray, and never ceases to
shine on all who truly seek it, and trust in it.”
We must preserve this as one of the Election gems. What will the
Rock say, if MR. DISRAELI runs his barque ashore ?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[November 21, 1868.
MustERING For THE MÉLÉE.
FROM Lizard Point to John o'Groat’s, from Fair Head to Cape Clear,
'Tis slogan cry, and brass blown high, chink of metal, flow of beer;
For the Great Tilt of the Session, . Electors' lists are dight
And, in cognisance and colour, are mustering squire and knight.
Chief of the knights defenders, arrayed to hold the field
SIR BENJAMIN D'IsrAELI on high hath hung his shield;
Party-per-pale its colours, its device a rope of sand,
And the legend—
“jºr fightts at prºbtatt that fightts for his cºunt hambt.”
Round him, in their pavilions, his knights companions see
SIR John DE PAKINGTON-LE-NEz, SIR Gyriosº HARD).
Northcote, and PATTEN, and WARD HUNT, but late a simple squire,
And, tower of strength, Lord STANLEY, cool son of heady sire.
What need to tell how to these strengths others bring ancient names,
MANNERs and RichMox D, CHAN Dos and MARLBoRough—here be
claims |
And what if somewhat slackly they sit or rashly ride,
They charge with weight of ancestry, and acreage beside.
Now shields are hung and gages flung, and armourer-work’s complete;
Targe braced, helm laced, 'tis time, I trow, each knight were in his seat;
But oh! 'tis heavy heaving, and many a hitch and fall,
Ere, fast and free, in saddle-tree, they are mounted one and all.
Nor them ’tis easy guiding those steeds with bit or spur:
Some fling out viciously behind, and some refuse to stir. . . . -
Though the dark hand of D'Is RAELI show the course he’d have them ride,
sºil. some bolt, some, bit in teeth, are circling wild and wide.
Little look these defenders like knights to hold a field,
Spite of broidery on housings and blazonry on shield.
'Tis many men and many minds, there where one mind should rule:
He may be a mighty master, but there’s murmuring in the school.
Not such the show where far below on the tourney’s level field
Are mustered the knights challengers to strike the defenders' shield,
To break their lusty lances, fair England's grace to win, -
As she bows the unhorsed defenders out and the challengers bows in 1,
Chief of those lusty challengers, grim, gaunt, but blithe of cheer,i
Curvets the gallant GLADston E upon his great destrere:
Sat ever warrior in selle so like a tower of steel? .
Trod ever steed so stately, or so answered hand and heel?
His shield is white, and fair to sight displays a rising sun,
And for legend “Lucem affero /* º in gold, doth run;
And his lance is like a weaver's beam, but, in his stalwart hand,
He sways and sweeps it lightly, as a child a hazel wand.
At GLADSTONE’s side, feet planted wide, broad-shouldered, square, and
Stout
Joh N Bright, that sturdy swordsman, ſlings his two-hand blade about:
'Ware swashing blow, or friend or foe, that comes within its sweep,
It swings wider than he's 'ware of, and its edge cuts keen and deep.
And there a knot of gallant youths that their spurs have early won,
Who take no glory from a sire, but will leave it to a son;
ForsTER, and BRUCE, and STANSFELD, and CHILDERs, good at need,
Bony and bright their coursers, though with no boast of breed.
And with these youth are veterans, seamed with old battle-scars,
Whose delight is tilt and tourney, and talk of ancient wars:
And philosophic heads are here that in helmets strangely show—
Mild MILL, and FAwcETT needing not eyes' help to find the foe.
Now speed you, lusty challengers, for God and your good cause,
The ennobling England's statecraft, and amending England's laws.
The lists are clear, the hour is here—the hour and eke the man!
Charge, gallants, charge, on either part, and let him win who can!

SPAIN.
(From our own Correspondent.)
HAT do the Oxford Dons, say
to the Spanish Revolution?
I believe they have given in
their adhesion to the Provi-
sional Government. I have
been asked why they don't
offer the crown to the O'Con-
NOR DON. But how do I
know? Or, if I did, how can
I tell? I can’t : I won’t.
The present, state of Spain
is impecuniosity. Is ABELLA
could come back, for money:
if there was any money to come back for. If she only promised to
be good for the future (and, she has made one step, you see, by
shutting the Palace door, after the Intendant had stolen off, against
future male ballet-dancers or opera-singers, and to be opened
only to grandees), she might yet make friends with the people:
though never with the Reds, who had much better be left to cut each
other's throats, as assuredly they will do in due course of time. As
your correspondent, I refuse all offers, and never take a bribe: remember
that fact, if you please, next quarter. The Spaniards are not a bit like
Don Giovanni or Leporello, or anybody I ever saw in their costume; so
they must be wrong. ...Perhaps before the Revolution it was otherwise:
now, at all events, will be the time for a theatrical costumier, DoN
MAIUs DE Bos STREETos, e.g., to come over and get first-rate dresses
for a mere song, or if not for an entire song, at all events for a couple
of small notes.

THE canvass at Aldershott Camp, I’ll be bound,
*Ood cover a good many acres o' ground.
Now canvass all over the country we see;
Some fellers come down here a canvassun me.
I went t'other day to the next market town.
There was handbills and squibs stuck all over the Crown;
Likewise the White Hart they had beautified too;
The one bills all yaller, the t'others all blue.
At that time BILL BUCKLE, the saddler, come by,
We both was athirst, and the Wheatsheaf well nigh;
About the Election our talk mostly run;
And I poked up friend BILL wi' some o' my fun.
“Well, WILLUM,” I sez to un, “bismus is—how P”
* Oh, well,” he replies, “pretty middlun, jest now.
... At 'lection times, hereabout, WILLUM,” sez I,
“”Tissed as how prices do mostly run high:
“I’ve heerd leather gaiters was last time so rare,

And how about sugar P Han’t mare a balloon

Says BILL, “Sitch fine times as they once have a ben,
I’m feared we bain't gwinn’ to zee here again;
But, Bribery Acts let um jº. as they ’ool,
The pus as is longest will have the best pull.
“Supposin' I do sell my birthright, why not,
To gie ’n away right when no judgment I’ve got?
I han’t a got no other rason to vote
And better than none ſaccounts a bank-note.”
Sez I, “BILL, that there’s thought a sensible rule
By others, 'sides you, that be less knave than fool.
The end o' which is that the country gits sold
To Railwaymen, jobbers, and schemers, for gold.
“As no better rason than money you own,
For votun', your best plan’s to laveit alone.
That there, BILL, 's the dooty o' fellers like you
Your country to serve 'tis the most you can do.”
“My country be blowed' " was BILL BUCKLE's reply;
“And as for my dooty I don’t know, not I,
No more nor the Church Catechism do declare,
And no word I knows on agin sugar there.”
Taking Things Philosophically.
READER, whatisfyour idea of the best way of spending one of these
long November evenings pleasantly? Is it not to attend a meeting of
the Cambridge Philosophical Society—going, it may be, an hour before-
hand, to secure a good seat—and listen to, perhaps, in the excitement
of the moment, encore, “Communications on the Factorial Resolution of
a" — 2 cos nº + * ” and “On some Porismatic Problems?” We are
sure it is, and we hope you enjoyed yourself, and had a tumbler when
all was over.
A Constituent's Question.
WHEN Candidates, to gain your votes,
In urgent manner sue,
Their importunity denotes
That they’ve some end in view.
Do Railwaymen at public good,
Or private objects aim P
Of all such customers you should
Ask—“What’s your little game?”
A PASTORAL IDEA.
A BISHOP's crook reminds him that he is, as it were, a Shepherd; and
then, if there are any Ritualists in his diocese, he must regard them as
so many silly sheep that have got the staggers.

LAST NOVELTY.
THIS IS How FitzwellingtoN CREATED A SENSATION WITH THE NEW
BROBDINGNAGIAN SAMPLE SCARF.
A SCRAP FROM A SPIRIT'S DIARY.
To Huntingdon, where a Church Conference and my LoRD SANDwigh did
º: a pretty short High and Dry Speech, and therein say, as I copy from a
aper:-
“He regretted that the Bishops had not the Power over their Clergy that they
ought to have. He instanced the 8. of MR. Purch As, at Brighton, towards the
Bishop of his Diocese. A Bishop ought to have the same Power over his Diocese as a
General had over his Army. Bishops ought to have Power of holding a Court-Clerical,
and he hoped in the next Session º Parliament it would receive Attention.”
Lard! to think what would happen if a Bishop did have the Power to try
Heretics and Apostates by Court-Clerical as a General do Deserters and the like
by Court-Martial' ...That Rogue, BUTIER, do talk of Pulpit Drum-ecclesiastic;
and methinks the Notion of a Pulpit Drum-head Court-Clerical mighty pretty.
No doubt we should soon see alſ that dare hold their own Way, and other-
wise than their Judge, tied up to the next Tree, or indeed more likely the
next Stake, and pretty short Work made of the Fssayists and Reviewers, and
CoLENso, and Voysey ! For I always note the Clergy almost all seem fain
to govern the Church and rule Men like a Schoolmaster do little Boys, making
Laws for the Nonce to whip them by, as Occasions, require. And so I do
believe if Bishops were able to hold a Court-Clerical to try People for Heresy,
they would, nine out of ten, not at all regard the Plea that the Charge was
no Breach of the Articles of Religion, but in any new Case and not within the
Thirty-nine, the Bishop would make himself both Law-maker, Judge and Jury,
all in one, and very likely Jack Ketch also.
And, Lardſ to think my LoRD SANDwich should say he wished Bishops
holding Courts-Clerical
Sounds THE SAME-At the Marylebone Election the Cabmen *jº

| THE LATE LORD MAYOR'S FAREWELſ.
GUILDHALL, NOWEAlBER 7, 1868.
AIR-" JWeber's Last Waltz.”
Lo, mine hours of office numbered .
Ah, my reign will soon be o'er!
With the robes of State encumbered,
I shall shortly be no more,
To my name I lose the handle
Which it bore throughout the year;
Lord by tenure, brief as candle-
Lordship not like that of Peer.
Brothers of the Corporation,
Fain my tongue to you would tell
All my sense of obligation,
Whilst I breathe my fond farewell
For those aids you me have rendered,
In my labours taking share :
Till my grateful thanks are tendered,
Oh, I cannot leave this chair!
Fare3. well, my coadjutors,
Aldermen, and Sheriffs two;
And, my trusty º
Chamberlain, Recorder—you !
On me, civic monarch reigning,
oft did irksome duties fall,
Which you lightened, part sustaining :
Officers, I thank you all.
Though laborious, in a measure,
Yet my year of mayoralty,
Notwithstanding, one of pleasure
Very great, has been to me.
Profit, which, with best endeavour,
At its worth I cannot sum,
I’ve derived from whomsoever
Into contact with I’ve come.
Whilst in life I’m yet abiding
You may see me, now and then,
At the Mansion-house presiding,
As mere Alderman, again.
Some years hence, if this November
I survive, when I sit there;
Then old times will you remember,
Saying, “He has passed the Chair.”
Take this Chair, then, my Successor,
hich must be no longer mine.
Of this Mace be thou possessor,
Purse and Sceptre I resign.
Sword of State, and Chain of Glory,
Take, to grace thy grandeur new.
Grandeur, oh, how transitory!
Take, oh, take, my wild adieu !
FIREPROOF THEATRES.
WE are informed by the Morning Post that all the scenery,
and all the coverings of the seats of the new theatre Delle
Logge, have been rendered incombustible by a process de-
vised by SIGNOR Borghi, wherein the essential element is
tungstate of soda. A similar method especially designed to
augment the safety of ships, commonly known in this country
as BURNETT's process, might, the Post judiciously suggests,
be more extensively applied to the purpose of protection from
fire. This idea merits the attention of managers of theatres,
in their own interest as well as that of the combustible British
Public, of which no member would ever get killed in the
crush created by a cry of fire, if there were no fear of fire, and
could therefore be no crush. We º the reference to
BURNETT's process for the benefit of those whom it may con-
cern, but may at the same time remark how odd it seems,
in reference to anything inflammable, that the process of
BURNETT should prevent it from igniting.
Success to Sidney Sussex.
THERE is nothing surprising in Cambridge Undergraduates
protesting against their bad dinners. They have only done as
the people of England are doing all over—shown a determina-
tion to have a change for the better in the “Commons.”

ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITH A WOICE.-SECOND SPECIES OF THE
GENUS.–THE BIG MAN WITH THE LITTLE WOICE.
A very big man, six feet two in his stockings, and six feet four in
his boots; that is, allowing, as they say at cribbage, “two for his
heels.” A prominent man, carrying as it were all before him, or cer-
tainly nearly all. Middle-aged and prematurely bald, being exposed to
the nipping and eager air at that height from the ground. His voice
takes you entirely by surprise, it is so small, but at the same time so
sweet. . After TUPTON, with his shouting, and SILFORD, with his
double basso profondo, NoFFINGER's voice comes as a comforting
revelation. º
NorBINGER warbles, or now he thinks he warbles as he used to
warble when a young man. Now he rather wobbles t warbles,
but still there are many who agree with me, that they’d rather hear
!NoHRINGER at forty-three, than most amateur or professional tenors
at twenty-five, that is as long as NoHRINGER sticks to his own line.
having a voice, having been*. for his voice, having
come at last to consider his as the voice of all voices, a pocket-voice as
it were, easily taken out to evening parties, and capable of being car-
ried up and down anywhere without the smallest inconvenience,—
having, I say, become accustomed to regard it in this light, he stops at
nothing.
*iment, before NorBINGER, that your musical party, so evenly
balanced will come to grief, because SILFoRD's basso won’t be there.
. “Well,” says Northinger diffidently, he is always diffident in open-
ing up a suggestion, “Well, is the music difficult?” You reply—No,
not very.
: Have you got it?” NoRRINGER asks.
“Yes, here it is.” You show it to him. . NoFRINGER looks over it
with what he intends to be the eye of a musician, and hums something
indistinctly (he takes precious good care to be indistinct) which has in
it the character of the air before him, and causes perhaps somebody to
: “I didn’t know you were such a musician, NorFINGER,” being
taken in by this reading at sight.

WHERE's the OSTLER }"
Shall Boy. “SHURE, or 'LL P-HUT 'M op. For YE, SoR. THE other MAN's Gone IV A. ARRAND !!”
l
“Oh, didn't you?” says NoHRINGER, cheerfully. . .
“There are very few things,” he continues, looking round at the
company with a jolly cheery sniggle (as much as to convey, “It’s very
absurd my having to make this mention of myself, which everyone here
knows to be true,”)—“There are very few things I can’t do: in music,
at least.” By which reservation he hints that he is perhaps not so expert
in gunnery, architecture, surgery, painting, and a few other arts and
sciences, although, somehow, he does give you to understand (by silent
eloquence) that he’s not such a very bad hand at even these matters;
in fact, when it comes to conversation on any one of them he generally
professes “to know something of these matters,” whatever may be the
topic in dispute. Of course, he knows well enough, without formu-
lating the syllogism, that the majority, reasoning from what he can do
in music, will give him credit for a great deal he can’t do out of it.
. “Well,” says Noahngen, after reading the bass part aforemen-
tioned, “this isn't out of my compass.” -
Some one expresses a doubt of this, whereupon NorringºR sits down
to the piano, and playing a few chords, goes down to his lowest note,
“which,” he says, “ of course, isn’t very clear to-day, because it’s
just after luncheon,” or dinner, or . as the case, may be, or
ecause it isn't after any of those meals, either excuse being a good
one for each individual constitution. -
Hear NoHRINGER singing something quite above his reach, or below
it. You tell him it doesn’t suit him. NoHRINGER immediately “begs
your pardon; it does suit him exactly; in fact, it might have been
written for him, so exactly does it suit his organ; only his organ is, so
delicate that the slightest irritation caused either by some inconsiderable
humidity in the atmosphere, or ...; early in the morning forgotten to
take a lemon, or having, unfortunately, eaten a fig the night before, or
not having had anything since breakfast—for my organ (he explains)
uires much sustenance, and that at regular times—at once affects
the bronchial tubes, and causing a certain roughness in the orifice of
the glossal pipe, prevents the voice, which is purely from the chest, not
in the head or throat–not (he assures you earnestly) in the head or
throat (as if he would be indeed hurt if you thought that)—from issuin
forth with its usual clarity.” You thank him for the explanation, an
probably observe—if you know nothing about anatomy or medicine
yourself—that he appears to be “quite a doctor in these matters.”

“I should think I was,” he exclaims, cheerfully smiling, as if it is
intensely amusing to him that you shouldn’t know that: “I’ve studied
these things. Lor' bless you, there are very few doctors who could
pose me.” Nokki NGER is a Solicitor. “I studied surgery for some
time under old Cooper, who used to say to me, ‘Norfly, my boy,
you’ll beat us all, if you only stick to it. But,” he adds, as a sort of
tribute to his kindhearted disposition, “I couldn't stick to it.” After
this confidence you begin to look with a certain amount of reverence
* a man who can sing you a song or set you a leg, whichever you
e, as easily as I write this next word.
Talking of causes of vocal derangement, the quasi-discovery of ozone
was a godsend to NoFFINGER. ... “By Jove, Sir,” he’d say, when he
was only in doubtful voice, “I didn’t get º mouthful of ozone this
morning. Short constitutional for a quarter of an hour, in a thoroughly
ozonised atmosphere, is the thing for my organ.” He sp of ozone
as if it was bought by the pound, and put into the air every morning by
some one whose business it is to look after this sort of thing: perhaps
the Secretary to the Board of Health.
As a solicitor he is supposed to have lost a great deal of business
through his voice. It was said his voice kept him away from the office.
He was always out somewhere. A bitter critic once said of him, that
this last remark would cause him the loss of all his musical friends as
well as his clients. When asked his ºn; he explained that
“Singing or not, NoFRINGER was always out.” But this was unchari-
table, for Nor RINGER sings beautifully in tune when taking a part in a
glee or chorus.
He is always astonishing people with his voice, and the older he gets
the more—by his own account—he astonishes them. Sometimes he sings
so well as to positively astonish himself.
The first time I had the pleasure of making his acquaintance was
while waiting for our host to come down, and introduce us, his two
only guests, who were to dine with him.
We bowed to one another. He was in the room when I entered.
“SMITHsON isn’t down,” says MR. North INGER, smiling. I see he
is not, I say, and look at my watch so as to check my own and
SMITHsON’s punctuality. “Just seven,” I observe. “A little past,
isn't it?” asks Nor RINGER, by way of not allowing the conversation
to drop merely through an agreement of time-pieces. “Then I am a
trifle slow, I dare say,” I return, humouring him. We settle that I am
a trifle slow; or finally, that, perhaps, he may be a little fast, that if one
is right the other is wrong, or if SMITHSON is going by his clock, then
we are both wrong, and so we smile at one another, and I observe that
town’s not very full. He too has noticed this fact; but makes an
exception in favour of Bond Street, where there was quite a block of
carriages this afternoon. This, though, he thinks may be accounted for
by the Afternoon Concert at Hanover Square Rooms.
“Oh, a Concert?” I say, and feeling that after all his endeavours to
sustain conversation I oughtn't to allow the shuttlecock to drop now,
I ask, “What Concert?” This North INGER doesn’t know ; but
GARDONI, he says, is there. “Ah, I like GAR pox1,” I observe, having
heard him once in something, of which f don’t recollect anything
definite, except that it wasn’t Les Huguenots, when (not being well
osted in musical matters) I know I heard MARIo. “Ah!” says
NoFFINGER of GARDON1, “thin voice, no sweetness. Do you recol-
lect his Ah mia madre ** and with that he sits down to the piano
and strikes some chords. He can play very nicely, I think to myself.
What a sweet voice, I say, also to myself. I find afterwards that all
his accompaniments are in one key, and his entire musical know-
ledge is confined to those chords which do duty in various tunes to all
sorts of airs, the gaps between them, when they are not quite suitable,
being filled up by a good deal of action in lifting up and putting down his
hands, turning his body to a three-quarter view, and stretching out his
left leg as if he were so au fait at the instrument, it didn’t matter to
him how he sat; but knowing him better, I have seen him throw a quick
nervous glance out of the corner of his eye, to see if his left and right
hand were coming down on the correct notes for a finish.
I compliment him. He accepts it easily, and makes light of such
a trifle as a tenor song. -
When he is giving you reminiscences of operas, he is knowing
enough never to give one entire; but only a fragment of it, as far as
his chords will go (which you don’t find out for some time), and stopping
at such a point as leaves what he could have done with the remainder
to your favourably aroused imagination.
SMITHSON doesn’t come down; and Nor RINGER, finding in me a new
and willing audience, commences a eulogy upon his own organ, a lec-
ture on chest voices, head voices, and voices in the throat, with a hint
or two as to style and treatment, a passing review of some of the prin-
cipal singers, English, Italian, and German, during the present century,
with vocal illustrations generally tending to show how far superior he,
NoFRINGER, could have been to any one of them if he had liked; which
opinion had indeed been expressed, so he says, by some of the leading
vocalists, who must have been so dreadfully afraid of this terrible Nor-
RINGER, that it struck me at the moment, how kind it was of him to
restrain himself, and not come out of his drawing-room practice; and
finally, winding up with a question to me, put suddenly, but founded,
like an examination query, upon the previous lecture, as to “what
should I say was the compass of his voice?”
I feel I ought to have some idea on the subject, after all he has been
telling me; but as I haven’t the most remote, I look thoughtful for a
minute or so, during which I wonder if S Mithson will come down and
help me out of it, and, say, at last, that I really can’t guess.
he reply pleases him. “You wouldn’t believe,” he says, “that it
took in all this.” Whereupon he sings a high note, and strikes one
several times on the piano, to show it's the same and no deception,
like a conjuring trick. Then he sings a very low one, and repeats the
same action; and then, as I see he expects it, I look utterly astonished
and say, in a subdued tone of admiration, “Really.' That is a compass.’
And he returns, more pleased than ever, “Isn't it?” and is going to
encore himself, and go all over it again, when SMITHSON enters, and we
are introduced.

VOTE FOR THE POCKET-BOOK.
THE Standard has brought out a clever proof of the absolute duty of
everybody to vote at this election. It shows how a single tourist, by
hurrying home from Switzerland, turned a scale by one vote, and that
the Member so elected, in his turn, by one vote saved the country, more
or less. The story is like a beautiful romance that appeared in one of
Mr. Punch's Pocket Books, and which showed how a European war
was brought on, by a button coming off. But the Standard is quite
right. Everybody ought to yote in this struggle. British Nation, let
us know exactly what you think. This reminds us (in fact, we write the
whole paragraph to lead up to the announcement), that Mr. Punch's
next Pocket, Book will be the most amazing one that ever has been
issued, and that we are delaying it partly because the printers cannot
work for laughing, and partly because we want to get in the list of the
new House of Commons.
“Not Air of the Ed, Stoopid!”
THE clever Spanish Correspondent of the Morning Post appears to
us to have lapsed for a moment into hypercriticism. In one of |. we
pleasant letters he says, “An heirless old leader like Esparteno will
never do for Spain.” What has his baldness to do with it The
Crown would hide that, to say nothing of his laurels.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“DEFENCE, NOT DEFIANCE.”
ALMost the last act of Bishop TAIT before
leaving Fulham for Lambeth, was a fitting
crown of the good work he has been dºing
in his bishopric—the acceptance of the Pre:
sidency of an Association now being formed
in London, to which Punch, is glad to call
his readers' attention, and wish his and
their God-speed. . Its object is the Pre-
vention of Pauperism and Crime—by strik-
ing at their roots. - -
oth these cankers are spreading in
London.
Metropolitan pauperism, by the official
returns, has increased 50 per cent. in the
last three years. Where there were
00,000 paupers in January, 1866, there
were lº in January, 1868. Two
thousand convicts
are yearly turned
loose from our con-
vict establishments,
and 100,000 crimi-
mals of all sorts
from our gaols.
And, lastly (says
the prospectus of
this new Associa-
tion) “it is esti-
mated that there are
at this time in London upwards of 100,000 children without proper
guardianship, education, food, clothing, or employment, ready many of
them to be instructed in crime by the discharged convicts and crimi-
mals with whom they are necessarily brought into contact.”
Now, Punch, like everybody who has gone º the London
Yi. knows, by sad experience, that London poverty has many roots.
dleness, drunkenness, improvidence, early marriages, the pauperisation
of parochial doles, and ill-directed charity, all help to feed the upas-tree.
But there is a vast deal of the poverty of London which arises from the
saddest of all causes—want of work, where there is willingness to work.
It is to this root of the poverty of London that this Association means
to address itself, byP. the co-operation of existing charitable
agencies, official an ... giving facilities and aids towards the
employment of the destitute and vagrant, and the industrial training
and education of homeless and uncared-for children.
There is nothing that rings more mournfully on the ear of the
voluntary almoners of the poor than the sad hurden of “out of work.”
—no sight sadder, than the return, to the cold hearth and hungry wife
and little ones, of him that should be the bread-winner—foot-sore, and
heart-sick—from his long and unsuccessful tramp for work. Surel
something could be done by such an Association as this, to whic
ARchbishop TAIt has just given his name, by establishing centres of
communication, and co-operation in each parish, with the view. to
discover, record, and make known where work is to be had for willing
hands. There is many a discharged convict, too, who would prefer
the wages of industry to the uncertain fruits of crime, with its sure
consequence of detection and punishment. These the Association pro-
poses to help in their sore struggle back to honest ways.
We have headed our notice of the proposed Association “Defence,
not Defiance.” Its founders are volunteers in the noble army of
#º against sin, sorrow, and suffering, and they have a right to
take the Volunteers' motto. If they cannot defy those gaunt giants,
Crime and Pauperism, they can rear against them the defences of
benevolent effort and timely prevention. What can be done in this
way is shown by the Red-hill Reformatory, where out of some three
hundred lads, between twelve and sixteen, all picked out of the sink of
the convict-prison, an average of above eighty per cent. is reclaimed,
taught, and turned out into the world, at home as well as in the
colonies, in possession both of the will and the way to earn an honest
livelihood. Why should there not be such a school, for each of our
London parishes, and every town in England And if this can be
effected for full-fledged young gaol-birds, might not as much at least
be done for our young Arabs before they have reached even the first
stage in the rogue's march to perdition ?

Ye most they colde doe was doe moe wrong,
Hush up all bate, and smoothè down all strife,
Anything onely for a quiet life.

A Doctor who schall nothing blink me shirke.
Ye clergè, that wolde get the upper hande
Of the realm’s law, I wis hee wyl withstande ;
And eke ye crewe which moveth every rope,
To set up Popery without y Pop E.
All Canterbury's Archbishoppes, of late, .
Have gone as doth a clocke pulled by a weight;
Or stood stuck fast in pomp, as pumpes in drought.
Which soe as they be worked will only spout.
Thys one, sans doubt, a will and wit wyll showe,
Sihence hys Grace doth bear a brain ſtrowe,
Which few before him, an the truth be said,
Have borne since when the last dyd lose his head.
More use and wisdom schal in TAIt be seene,
Than to speak maudlin words which no sense meane;
Thys wyll be an Archbishopp of a newe sorte,
For Canterbury not called Cantyn shorte.
There ys a saying which ys old and true,
And soe give Dizzy, by that rule, his due.
For, certes, whatsoever els he lacke,
He hath, at making Bysschops, a good knack.
Soe may hee, yff the Commons turn hym out,
And GLADston E send him to y' righte about,
Say, with hys bowe, “I gave you yonder man,
Choose an Archbishop better when ye can.”
May GLADSTONE, that schal govern bye-and-bye,
Live long, but never have the chance to try;
Ne who else Minister meanwhile may be,
Need to fyll Canterbury's emptye See.
DUKE AND DUKE.
ONE DUKE of BEAUFort was a man of the most elegant manners.
We were to dine with KING GEORGE THE FourTH, one day, at Brighton,
and his Grace was to be of the party. But he did not arrive, and our
Fat Friend liked to be punctual at table. We all went to dinner, and
the King said, “Puncé, my boy, of course we shall be sorry if anything un-
leasanthas detained Bºurgºt; but if he has been made late by a rifle,
f shall be glad of it, for it will do these young fellows good to see how
a perfect gentleman excuses himself.” “Right you are, George,” said
we, and soon afterwards the Duke came in, and his apology was grace
itself, which probably the King thought a good reason for having no
other grace. This Duke must not be confounded with another, who
wrote to a clergyman that he was “impertinent” for daring to ask aid
for his parish school, when he did not vote for the Duke's candidate;
nor was it the same Duke who declared that what the Conservatives
had got to do was to “get MR. GLADstone between their fingers and
thumbs.” Perhaps, however, there was no need to warn people against
mistaking the gentle for the ungentle Duke.
The Latest Remedy Out.
FRoºt his speech at Aylesbury, it may be inferred that MR. Dish AELI
thinks Ireland’s “damp climate” has a great deal to do with the
atmosphere of misery in which that country is mostly enveloped; and
that “a melancholy ocean” is the cause of its sea of troubles. Most
opportunely, according to the Pall Mall Gazette, “an ingenious
Frenchman has patented an invention by which he supplies artificial
climates, tempered to order, to invalids, tropical steam-packet compa-
nies, &c.” Cannot the ingenious Frenchman be induced to try his
wonderful invention on invalid Ireland P Will not MR. DisrAELI head
a subscription for a new climate for her? -

“THE SMUGGLER AT BAY.”
...This picture by PURCHAs (exhibited a few weeks ago at Brighton) is
illustrative of scenes familiar to all who are acquainted with Canterbury
and York, and the curiously-rigged vessels which traverse those stormy
sees. The Church-guard are constantly being signalled to keep a sharp
look-out, but no active attempt until recently has been made to board
the bold smuggler, and overhaul his saucy craft. At length, however,
Bishop, an intrepid guardsman, resolved on his own motion to make a
dash at a contrabandist on the south coast, and in the present picture
we see the smuggler at bay, Bishop being armed with a slender crook,
and his opponent defying him with a candlestick.
The contraband traffic is confined chiefly to Roman candles, milli-
nery, and articles of very trifling virtu, which are run in open daylight
from the Pontifical States into the middle aisles. Gallantry forbid that
we, by slip of pen, should cause unnecessary pain to those fair voyagers
who, last summer, on landing at Dover, never told their love of Brus-
sels lace, but let concealment feed on their damask cheeks. Neverthe-
less, candour urges us to declare that the smuggler we have in view
Call *# avoid sinking in his own esteem while sailing under false
colours. Hugging, the º: coast of Heresy, he turns his back
on the ancient lights of the adjacent quicksands, and is constantly
tacking about to take advantage both of the shallow and the deep.
England expects that every man will do his duty—not the customs b
which it is enforced. An old proverb tells us that we cannot touc
the produce of the fir without receiving a stain (to put it softly); and
certain it is that no man, however dexterous or ambi-dextrous he may
be, can play a smuggler's part with clean hands.

Church of England.” A better Arch-Primate than DR. TAIT could
not have been found. He knew that when a man desireth the office of
a Bishop, he desireth good work, and he took the office, and did good
work, and for what he said to the º little boys who wanted to ;
their toys to church, the Bishop or LoNDoN obtained from Mr. Pan
an historical picture, which is doubtless the proudest ornament in 22, St.
James's Square. The new ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY honours the
office he accepts. London and Lincoln are also fortunate in Doctors
JAckson and WoRDsworth; and Mr. Punch, who, may have less
pleasant things to say to the PREMIER before many days, makes him
three ji bows, and places on record that in the matter of eccle-
siastical patronage the aut lor of Coningsby has shown that, in the
language of his speech on his re-election, he has “always studied to

And Norf and Thouf Amellikee—ee—ee | | | | ''
are hereby advised to procure themselves that treat at whatever cost, and
MEW MAYORS.
OUR M.P.'s must not make us forget our Mayors, a list of whom
.. a few, practical observations, which, to prevent municipal
jealousies, shall be registered with alphabetical impartiality.
A stands for Abingdon, which furnishes a PAYNE, and if you require
a GLASIER you will find him at Lincoln. Who would have thought it?—
When we were introduced to him by our Mutual Friend, MR, DickeNs,
we little expected to live to see GUPPY Chief Magistrate of Barnstaple,
probably his native place, Bath is thorºughly happy with a Mayor
who is Jolly, and a Member who is Tite. Berwick’s Mayor is
Young—so were ByRoN, RAPHAEL, MENDELssohn, MASTER BETTY,
&c., when they first became famous. Has not Birmingham troops of
ood men of its own Why on earth then betake itself to Holla NDP
É. Birminghain is not singular in this º: for magnificent Liver-
pool has recourse to Dover, and a good old town, Newark, negotiates
successfully with WARwick. Winter this year is setting in early, for
from Chester comes a report of FRosſ, and the news from Clitheroe is
BLEAKLEY. Darlington's motto is PEASE at any price, so re-elects
him....Who ought to be at the head of a town F-one of its leading
inhabitants : so Derby thinks, and appoints a ForMAN. Grimsby
clings for support to a BANNISTER. Kingston-on-Thames has selected
a MARCH-the March"of intellect, we hope, for these are days of pro-
ress. Is not, Leeds a little too familiar, calling its new Mayor
EORGE * (Salford is still worse, for there even a Member of Par-
liament is commonly, addressed , as, CHARLEY.) Middlesborough,
which ought to be but is not in Middlesex, is an example to other
places, for it relies entirely on, Laws, unlike Qxford which requires
protection of a CASTLE. Though, Morpeth shows a preference
for a JoBLINg, we do not for a second suspect it of any leaning, to
a little job. Nottingham requires a BARBER for the second time, but
the list does not state whether his election was a close shave. Can a
clergyman serve the office of Mayor, especially, if he is likewise a
Regius Professor? Yet Stratford-upon-Avon, with the full approval
of SHAkspeaRE, has covered itself with honour by doing rather a
novel thing in choosing KINGsley. (This, perhaps, is the proper
place to notify that the MANsell, at Rochdale, is not the same person
as the new Dean of St. Paul's.) Stockport—HEGINBOTHAM : where
did we last meet with him P Was it not in “ Rejected Addresses.”
—More honours for fiction. At Truro the Mayor was re-elected; a
rising man, we imagine, certainly a CLYMA, perhaps some day to be an
M.P., which would be a climax. Windsor is unique—the Royal borough
has a CHAMBERLAIN for Mayor. For the third time the voice of Wey-
mouth is for TIZARD-we suppose he likes it, else he might murmur
“’tis hard.” Yarmouth, which from its position might have been
expected to produce say a Gull, delights in a NIGHTINGALE-far
before Tamworth, which can only show a RUFFE. Fitly enough, York
brings this list to an end with a-CLose... (Latest evening edition.
CLose declines to serve, and, in fine, has paid the penalty.)
Zoological.
ONE of the Scotch papers made LoRD MINTo say that something or
other was going to rise from its ashes, “like a Sphinx.” Well, it is
something to have spelled the word right, an achievement not common
to the press. Of course, LoRD MINto, who graduated, at Trinity, did
not say it, but he might as well have done so. Until, DR. SclatºR
exhibits a Phoenix at the Zoological Gardens, as he will probably do
next year (having now got everything else but that and a Kraken, which
is coming), Punch declines to believe in any Phoenix but Himself.
THE CURRENT Coin.-In the event of a contested election for Orkney
and Shetland, it is understood that all bets are to be paid in “ponies.”

THREE EYES.
Oxford and Cambridge, as we
all know, have been called the
Two Eyes of º: ... We
don't object to the designa-
tion, whetherit were originally
given sentimentally, or
cause they contain pupils
which would be a base an
contemptible jest. Some-
times those eyes would be the
better for a little wiping,
notably when one of them is
blind to the merits of men
like GLApston E and PALMER,
and so dim as to see much in
MR. Mowbray. But now that
the University of London is
not only famous, but has got
a Member of Parliament, and
has made choice of no de-
bility, but of Robert Lowe
surely England has a Third
Eye. London claims ocular
honours. Macbeth talks of
having Three Ears, and here
is a case of Three Eyes. The
new eye has more Speculation
than the old ones, and evi-
dently sees more clearly what
sort of man should represent
- - - - a seat of learning. Mr. Lowe
is hereby apprised that, in the coming Session, he must do all that he
knows; and that, if he takes office with Mr. GLADston E, we look for an
Education Bill...And if he wants to refresh his memory as to the sort of
Bill which Mr. Punch desires, that gentleman refers him—and everybody
else—to the last. Chapter, of Miil on Liberty, which chapter iſ.
Punch takes the MILL and Fº of saying gives, exactly, what he
himself would have written on the subject; that is to say, a lucid
development of a wise, design. Mr. Punch concludes by taking an
Eye-opener to the health of Bob Lowe and his Constituents.
VERY HARD NAMES.
MANY of Punch's readers are in the habit of reading Punch out loud
to their female relations and others whose apprehension of subtlety
needs assistance from elocution. This is a very laudable practice. It
would be well, indeed, if societies for the elevation and instruction of
the masses were to appoint Punch readers, duly remunerated, though
their labour, to be sure, would be, in most people's opinion, its own
sufficient reward, to read Punch to the º: at penny readings, and
in the cottages of the poor. But here is something which any reader
of Punch had better read to himself. It occurs in an obituary notice
of the late KING OF SIAM in the Morning Post.—
“PHRA BARD SoMDErch PHRA PARAMENDz MAHA Mongkut, also named
PhRA Chom KLAN Tu Hua, the supreme King of Siam, was the eldest legi-
timate son of BorroMMATHAM ... XATHARAt PHRA Chao PRASAT
Thong, supreme King of Siam, who died in 1824.”
. There is in existence, if not in print, a little book, written by a dis.
interested dentist, entitled Ten Minutes' Advice on the Care of the Teeth.
It is an imperfect work unless it contains a grave caution against any
attempt at the enunciation of such names as those of the late King of
SIAM and his Fº No less of a crackjaw character are the
seven names of his subordinate Siamese Majesty; for:—
“Siam, as is well known, has two kings, and the second king of the country
was PHRA BARD SoNDETCH PHRA Pwan ENDz RAMEso MAHiswaneso.”
Such names as the foregoing, may be regarded as almost as perilous
to, utter as the mastication of cheap college-pudding, or the plum-buns
sold by inferior pastrycooks. They are nearly, if not quite, as hard as
the small pebbles which commonly occur in those articles of food and
all others ºf the same stamp apt to contain gritty currants.
Note:-That the Siamese Kings are not as the Siamese Twins. One
King is above another, whereas the Twins are upon a par. Also, that
the two Kings of Siam, differ materially from those of Brentford. A
sub-King and a super-King cannot, with any congruity, be imagined
smelling at the same rose.
LORD MAYO.
TELEGRAM last week from Italy, “Psyche is waiting for the EARL of
MAYo.” What a charming Cupid—and what rhymes to Cupid?
AFTER THE MÉLÉE.
Now º: are blown, and warders thrown, forth like two waves
they go,
Challeºd Defenders—crests high and lances low ! -
Hark! The roar of shouting thousands—and the ring of shields and
glauves; - - -
Lo! the emptying of saddles, and the splintering of staves!
The dust-clouds fly so thick and high, they almost shroud from sight,
The rushing gleam of plumes that stream o'er housse” and harness
bright;
Scant time to test device or crest, as the mêlée hurleth past, ... .
Of knights that reel, and knights thatroll, and knights that still sit fast.
But now the clash of conflict’s o'er, the great tilt hath been run:
Men's hard-held breaths are freely drawn, and talk's pent tide may run;
And eager eyes may traverse the tell-tale field of fight, .
For count of gains and losses, and fate of squire and knight.
The knights defenders have the worst: the challengers have won
The prize that waits the conquerors, when the great tilt is run.
But though victor chief of victors, Giºns rose comes from the mélée,
He will miss good names at muster, and find gaps in his array.
Where º ten-man power of brain? Where BRUCE, with mind
and hand,
Ever as ready to obey, as able to command? -
Where MILNER GIBSON, fainéant in fight, but glib of speech,
Aye powerful at a parley, if of small count on a breach *
And these are noted captains, who high place would have ta'en, .
When GLADstone wipes his forehead, and counts his loss and gain:
Less grave, but not less notable, the blanks your seats display—
Roebuck, the rude and rough of tongue, BERNAL, the blithe and gay !
The stalwart SMITH of Westminster, with strength that baffles skill,
Hath earthward borne, in wisdom's scorn, the philosophic MILL :
Why saved he not for tilt the force that all to waste has gone, .
In patting BRADLAUGH on the back, and cheering CHADwick on ?
Some have fallen to fair fighting, some to might of coin and beer,
Some to the terror of a cry, and the phantom of a fear,
Some to hatred of the Pope, and some to feeling for the Church, .
Some to dread of GLADstone's ferule, some to trust in Dizzy's birch.
But be the losses what they may, the victory is ours—
The gallant GLADston E rideth, chief of resistless powers.
§. of the lists, prize of the fight, BRITANNIA bends to lay
er hand in his, to find therein her guidance and her stay !
* Housses—housings.
FLOREAT ETONA |
SAID Mr. Punch, as he was walking through the playing-fields with
DR. BALston. -
“Why is Football at Eton a demoralising pastime?”, The worthy
Doctor started. “Inasmuch,” continued the sage, calmly, “as it
teaches the boys a vain and meretricious art?” - - -
The excellent Doctor looked more astonished than ever he did since
BoLTER MAXIMUs took leave of him, without putting a ten-pound
note on his library table.
“If I thought that,” he exclaimed, “I would make the boys
give it up.”
“Nay,” returned Mr. Punch, pleasantly; “do not do that, but do
you yourself give up the conundrum?” .. - -
“I do,” answered the Master, responding for himself, as if he were
at a baptism, and had “renounced them all.” - -
“The practice of your Eton Football, then, is demoralising,” quoth
the amiable and learned Punch, “because it teaches the boys to Rouge.”
So they went into DR. BALston's house and sherried and biscuited.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 231
A CAUTION TO CAPITALISTS:
MR.PUNCH,--Some consolation may be derived
} large minds in narrow circumstances from
the following statement in the Paris corre-
spondence of a contemporary relative to a
great capitalist:—
“There was no repose for that mind—figures,
money; more figures, more money. At table he
knew not what he was eating, and the servant
sometimes reminded the Baron that he had not
taken wine or tasted something before him. He
could scarcely ever have seen a play or enjoyed
music; no doubt his dreams were all about money.
His art-treasures he knew he possessed, but had
no time to contemplate.”
Certainly, Sir, pea-soup, which you tuck
in with a relish, is preferable to turtle which
you eat without knowing it; would eat, that
is, unconsciously, if you were capable of
being so insensible. §e. also is swipes
or bitter ale, which you enjoy at all, than
the Château d'Yquem or Chambertin that you
care not to take. Not to know what you
are eating is about the unhappiest of all igno-
rance, and indifference to your liquor is the
most wretched apathy. You are happier, if
you can take pleasure in a public sculpture
or picture gallery, than you are in the pos-
session of no end of art-treasures which you
have no time to look at: All work and no
- º and no music, will certainly result in
making JACK a dull boy, how rich soever;
and, as for dreams all about money, if they
are the dreams of avarice, and avarice has
none other; avarice has bad dreams.
But, Sir, if anybody, from the "above-
quoted bit of biography, argues that opu-
lence is undesirable, give him thistles,
until he asks for a penny, to buy a roll.
Whoever infers that money is not º is either a truist or
a moke. To be sure, money is not happiness if you spend all
your time in making it, and no time in converting, it into flavour,
or , some other joyous sensation. Our capitalist had to make no
end of money. Very likely he could have been happy on a certain
allowance. Of course, money in a box is not happiness in itself; but
you can be happy in thinking of the good you are going to get with it
or perhaps to do; or if, whilst you contemplate the cash, you applau
§: although the public may be hissing you. Oysters cost money.
ay they are two shillings a dozen. lf so, many oysters are so much
money; then money is oysters, for one good thing out of º: In
so far as oysters are happiness to the oyster-eater, money is happi-
owed his oysters, he bolts without paying }.
Il
ness, unless, having sw -
them, as DANDo did, even in the fº old times of cheap oysters.
eating oysters we may now indeed be said to eat money.
... As money is oysters, so it is every other luxury or comfort. Money
is meat, money is clothes, money is fire. The increasing cold reminds
us that money is coals, and money is blankets, and there are rich
#. to whom money is the happiness of distributing them, and soup
kewise, among the starving and shivering poor. I am, Sir, one
whom circumstances compel to be shabby and mean. I should be
happy if they allowed me to be splendid and generous. A would-be
EABODY, I am an actual Elwes.
P.S.--Money not happiness! Why, Sir, you yourself are 3d.—4d.
stamped. Punch is the happiness of millions.
CONGRATULATION TO H.R.H.
THE PRINCE of WALEs and all his family (except Baby, who stops
With Grandmamma at Windsor) have departed for the long tour
that is to take them to the Second Cataract, Mr. Punch would have
* Companied them, but for his duty to his .# He wishes them
*oº of pleasure and joy, but does he not envy the PRINCE for being
out of the Nº. of the Preternatural Cackle which has begun with the
*lections, and will endure until the Second Prorogation? A report of
*peeches that will be made in the meantime would, if laid on end,
*ch from Charing Cross to the Pyramid, which the Princess is going
to * fºr the first time. And the Rºyal Party are out of sound of it
all! There is something in being a Prince, and if we were not Punch
We would be H.R.H.
pº, Tºrº-The Church of England being in want of a head,
*AELI has shown his sense by giving it a Tête.
PYROTECHNICAL CHEERS.
At Ultra-Protestant Demonstration Meetings enthusiasts sometimes
make a noise called “Kentish Fire.” It indicates approbation. A
similar kind of fire has been adopted, if not invented, by the students of
Princeton College. It may, perhaps, be said to be New Jersey fire.
This fire is indeed, so to speak, a firework, being named a rocket.
According to the New York Times, the new President of the above-
named seat of learning, DR. M'Cosh, delivered his inaugural address
the other day, when—
“He spoke with a very strong Scotch accent, and is by no means a graceful
orator, but he produced throughout a most favourable impression upon all his
hearers, and especially upon the students, one of whom shouted as the speaker
closed, “Long live PRESIDENT M'Cosh ' ', and then proposed three cheers,
which were given with a will, followed by the usual tiger and ‘rocket.’ This
rocket, by the way, is a thoroughly Princeian institution, and as such deserve
ing a word of description. It is given with a f-z-z-z-boom—ah ! The first
exclamation is supposed to imitate the flight of a rocket in the air; the second
the explosion, and the third the admiring exclamations of the enthusiastic
spectators as they witness the burst of coloured fire.”
Surely this rocket is a very º: firework. . In this country, at
least, its display would be attended with great risk. Let off in the
open air, at an election for instance, it would, to be sure, do little
rsonal damage. But in a theatre its effects might be most disastrous.
he sound of f-z-z-z uttered on the *. of an actor, or at the
fall of a curtain, would, if intended to express commendation, or
encouragement, be entirely misunderstood on the British #. The
noise made by a rocket differs only in loudness from that which a squib
makes, and amongst us a squib is considered to hiss. In addition, it
may be observed that the “tiger cheer” of Princeton would in London
be far from cheering. An English audience is not used to express its

MR. PUNCH is much displeased with Westminster, and doesn't care
who knows it. . The election of CAPTAIN GRosvenoR, when it involved
the rejection of John STUART MILL, was something worse than a mis-
take. It was seen that the Conservatives had rallied round MR. SMITH
in a way which made it clear that he would be at the head of the poll,
and seven thousand Tories have as much right to be heard as six
thousand Liberals. MR. SMITH is an able man, and will make a very
good Member. But the six thousand ought to have exercised dis-
cretion, and when the choice lay between i. son of Lord EBURY and
the father of Political Economy, the Westminster Liberals should have
known better than to choose the wrong man. Had they plumped for
MILL after one o'clock on that Tuesday, Westminster would have been
spared the disgrace of hearing MR. MILL say that “a sensible man
ought not to be much moved by losing a contested election.” People
have said that MR. MILL has made some mistakes, and thereby alienated
the regard of friends, but what is the friendship worth that forgets a
hundred noble services and remembers a few twopenny errors ? West-
minster is not sufficiently educated, as yet, to comprehend how great a
man MR. MILL is; and Punch, by this writing under his hand and
seal, deposes her from her position as Queen of ă. Representation, and
degrades her to the ranks of mere boroughs. 2-

THE MAN WITH ANOSE—HIS MELANCHOLY STORY, COMMENCING
WITH HIS EARLIEST HOME AND SCHOOL DAYS.
Of all the Odd Men Out, it is a toss up—as is natural in the present
instances—whether the Oddest Man Out is not, all cases considered,
the Man with a Nose. Do we not remember a German fairy tale, one
by the Brothers GRIMM, bearing this title, wherein, as you may recol-
lect, an unfortunate, soldier ate an apple, and straightway his nose set
off growing with such rapidity that it was encountered by the man's
comrades six miles off, who, tracing this nose upwards to its source
and also following their own as well, came at last upon their frien
seated under a tree in a woeful plight. Well nigh as wonderful, fairy
agency excepted, is PUTTYK's nose; taking, as usual, PUTTYK as my
representative man.
ot that his nose is long; on the contrary; that is, I mean it is
rather short. It is an ordinary nose. You wouldn’t stop in the street
and say, “What a nose that fellow has "" if PUTTYK passed. Conse-
uently it is a nose which would escape notice in a crowd. It is neither
man, nor Grecian, nor of any other order of Nasal Architecture. It is
a nose pure and simple, and as such, judging by sight, alone, would
not place its owner, in my gallery of Odd Men Out. But it is not by
sight alone, if by sight at all, that you will arrive at the conclusion,
that, in the presence of PUTTYK’s nose, you are near something ve
much out of the common. The remarkable !...". connected wit
PUTTYK’s nose are those of sound, objectively and subjectively, of mus-
cular tension, of membraneous irritation, and extraordinary pressure
upon the nervous system. After the above description (as far as it
goes) I need scarcely add that I am no anatomist, nor doctor, nor

It is a delicate subject to touch, this nose of PuTTYK's; everyone
will, I am confident, recognise the picture as I scumble it in. [I have
said I am not a professional medico, neither am I a painter, but if
“scumble” isn't a good word, I don't know one when I hear it. I once
knew an elderly gentleman, an artist, who was always “scumbling.” He

some Poet. - - - - - - -
“Oh,” he’d say, working away with his right hand, “just scumbling
in a little.” Then I’d look and see a clean place left for Ptolemy's
wife to come into presently, in the middle of all the scumbling.
Midday I’d find him standing a little way from his easel, with his
left leg forward, his head well back and on one side, like a raven in a
difficulty, and his hands in such an attitude as he would probably adopt
were he going to fight any one with his palette for a shield, and his
paint-brush as a sword.
... Well; how are you getting along?”
“Oh,” he’d reply, “just got the scumbling in.”

I have known PUTTYK for years, he was a very much younger child
than I was, and I still have the disadvantage of him in #" of age.
His nose was always getting him into trouble. His father, old

more cleanly at home from his being his own master, and very man

sorts of things, in a general way (paper bags for bakers, and screw:
{...}. with riddles on 'em, for the tobacconists, and public-houses, I
ieve, were a large source of income) by the aid of complicated and
powerful machinery, which began whizzling and steaming, and con-
suming old PUTTYK’s smoke by Act of Parliament, from eight in the
morning until six at night. So when old PUTTYK came, home (I was
often there for young Puttyk to play with, but I despised him in those
days, º myself, and he was hardly out of frocks with curls
like a girl), he went up to his room, and returned thence very clean and
meat, with a shirt-front as irreproachably spotless as was his moral
character underneath, supposing it to be on the left side—call it heart.
Young PUTTYK, JIMMy, was admitted to see his father dine; and as
sure as PUTTYK Senior had sat himself down to his soup, so certainly
would PUTTYK Junior sniff. This would lead to an inquiry as to the
whereabouts of his pocket-handkerchief, followed by a search in all his
ockets where it wasn’t, succeeded by a short stirring lecture on noses,
andkerchiefs, and stupid dirty little boys (whereat I used to smile
ifyingly at little JAMEs), and finally an order to go up to Nurse
F. to Nurse,” haſ haſ mine had been gone three years since) and
bring one down.
The next difficulty with my friend PUTTYK's nose was the use of the
handkerchief. His father had a regular drill for this. There were
words of command, such as “Take it out of your pocket,” “Hold it
well in the middle,”—JEMMY’s eye on his father all the time—“Now
then l’’ which was the signal, as it were, to fire.
Oh, such a failure | A little tweaky, stringy sound, like a

with pocket-handkerchief. Nothing more simple, he would say—but
so would have been, to JPMMY at least, the little doll's head in a green
bag, or the omelette in the hat, which ancient mysteries he had seen
the venerable magician, MR. SpRATT, E." in the dining-room at
Christmas, had the wretched little boy known how to do them.
“I can’t make out,” he said sadly, one day to me, “how Papa makes
such a noise,” and I saw that the poor boy had been relicarsing until
his eyes were dangerously bloodshot.
He little knew then what eminence in the line he would achieve
some day; nor had his father the slightest idea of what amount of
misery and suffering to his son, and others, he was laying the founda-
tion, when he went through the nose-drill every morning with the
unfortunate JIMMY, and paraded his own organ as the model.
The tears JIMMYPUTTYK has shed over that mose of his in his poor
father's life-time would have washed a pocket-handkerchief. Growing
older and less able to brook a scolding, he would retire into corners
for a gentle blow, or choose the moment when the front-door announced
his father's return; anything to avoid a blow in his parent’s presence.
f motice now that JAMEs Pºrtyk's son has it, in embryo, and I should
thence conclude, if I might without offence, that this was a Nose which
ran in the family. - -
At sixteen, JIMMY's nose had got beyond him—it was uncontrollable.
I was six form then, and in my last half. I had occasional .
of seeing Young PUTTYK, to whom I had promised, on consideration of
certain tips from his father (0 ingenuus Puer'), my powerful protection.
In the middle of a construing lesson before a sharp and severe
master, PUTTYK’s mose would make itself heard, and immediately
et its owner into a scrape : its owner having the best reasons for
eeping himself as much as possible out of the master's sight and
penny
mind.

Master Puttyk rises, with a vague idea as to where the other boy

the next boy in his unhappy situation. Nerf boy, however, feels SMick's
eye is on him, and ignores PUTTYK's distress.

RECREATIVE RITUALISM.
THE Court of Common Pleas has decided that the “Recreative
Religionists” have a right to perform services, including sacred music
and instructive lectures, on Sundays, and receive payment for reserved
seats. Such payment has long been usual at chapels and churches
maintained by voluntary support; sacred music has constituted one of
the chief attractions; and lectures have been delivered under the name
of sermons, at least professedly instructive. This is all very well; and
the service of Recreative Religion, is a reasonable service, which per-
sons of that persuasion may surely practise without just ground of
offence to those of any other. But ought not the line to be drawn
somewhere? Have not our Mahometan fellow-subjects, or guests, a
right to mosques, as our Jewish have to º: Might not the
| possible establishment of a mosque possibly lead to a performance of
dancing dervishes under the pretence of a devotional exercise If this
were permitted, it would be difficult to prevent, the ballet being

on Sundays under the denomination of a Jumpers' Chapel.

| How luxurious living is spreading ! The very beasts of the field are
turning epicures. They have lºng had their appetites tempted with
various delicacies in the form of “Foods,” and now the last novelty in
cookery for Cattle is feeding them with cocoa; chocolate, we presume,
being reserved for the more aristocratic, animals—race-horses, prize
oxen, successful Southdowns, and the like. Rare times these for
horses, cows, sheep, and pigs! No, more common oats, and hay; no
more plain turnips and oil-cake, and meal; but almonds and raisins
and asparagus *; boiled, with melted butter, and macaroons an
pound-cake, and Ribston, pippins, and truffles (specially for the pigs)
with iced water, and lambs’ wool and possets, and all SAINSBURY's
summer beverages to drink. We do not despair of hearing that the
times are so much improved, that even poor old rheumatic farm-
labourers are able to enjoy a jorum of hot cocoa, sweet and strong,

A CONSOLATION PARAGRAPH.
THE Tories have gained several signal victories in
Lancashire. People ask how this is, Lancashire and
Liberalism being supposed to have other links than the
only one which j men say connects Modesty and
Merit—the initial. The answer which is given is that
the Lancashire men know the Irish Catholics well, and
don’t like them, and won't support candidates who are
friendly to their interests. That has something to do with
it. But Mr. Punch guesses at another reason. The fact
Witches are jealous of the rivalry. , Lancashire men
| are always running over and losing their hearts in Ire

exerted, and the Liberal candidates in Lancashire have
really been sacrificed at the shrine of English beauty. If
this does not console them, nothing can; and Mr. Punch,
ever ready with balm and oil, thus, picks them ". and
. a slightly reproachful kiss to the beauties of Lanca-

HOW SOLD BREAD.
MR. ARNOLD gave his decision the other day that “Cot-
tage loaves” were “Fancy Bread,” and were not amenable
º #: laws which regulate the sale of the ordinary “staff
of life.”
| “Oh tell me what is “Fancy Bread’?”
The public unto ARNoLD said.
“Should it be weighed like tea or lead?”
“No,” worthy ARNOLD deci-ded.
“If you get cottage loaves instead
Of that on which you should be fed,
And will new-fangled food-paths tread,
Not those your fathers follow-ed,
You must put up with being bled,
If you will fancy Fancy Bread.”
“Haussez les Mains, Messieurs!”
WE read in the papers the announcement that “the
House of Commons and its approaches have been thoroughly
cleansed.” Punch hopes this is true—particularly the
approaches—as, from some stories he has heard of the
Elections, he finds a difficulty in believing it. He can only
hope that honourable Members will all show clean hands
on meeting in their clean house.

FINLEN’S ALLOWANCE.
AT rascaldom's demonstration in Hyde, Park, on Sunday week,
MR. FINLEN is reported to have expressed himself in a speech chiefl
characterised by abominable words; but containing a declaration whic
many respectable people will be glad to hear:—
“He declared that he had been kicked that day by the police because he
was the “only prominent public man' who dared to stand up in defence of
Fenianism.”
It is only to be hoped that in making this statement MR. FINLEN
spoke the truth. Not that it is desirable that MR. FINLEN should have
been kicked by the police for his advocacy of treason. The police
have no right to take the law into their own feet in dealing with even
such a subject as MR. FINLEN. It may be the opinion of some that a
law which subjected him to being kicked would have been a wholesome
law; but his mere advocacy of Fenianism is better treated with simple
contempt. Of itself it is not of sufficient “...l. to require so
much as the notice of a kick. No kick can be administered without
giving pain, and humanity forbids the infliction of unnecessary pain
even on a Frien. Neces pain is another thing. MR. FINLEN
tried to collect a mob on Clerkenwell Green. . He was compelled to
move on. Perhaps he had to be kicked to make him move on. The
police were then under the necessity of kicking him. He endured the
necessary pain of necessary kicks. This is probably the true account
of the fact that he was kicked by the police, and, if so, that fact is
eminently satisfactory. The police only did their duty in kicking
MR. FINLEN. Let us hope that they will never have occasion to do
it again, but will do it again if, and whenever, they have. All
that MR FINLEN has to do is to be careful to move on when he
is told by the police, instead of waiting to be kicked. Under
the ignominy of which he has proclaimed himself the victim at the
: of the police, he had better, in the meanwhile, sit down as well as
6 Can.
WASON v. WALTER.
We never thought to have to mention RIGBY WAson's name again.
But it must descend to posterity, and thus we place it on the groove
for immortality. He has been the cause of a final and solemn decision,
by the Queen's Bench, that, the Public has a right to reports of Par.
ºº:: and that a journal publishing faithful reports
is not to be liable to an action by anybody touching whom Parliament
men may have said what he does not like. “WAson v. WALTER,” will
be the case to squash any such attempt. But all the gratitude we can
find in our hearts is to MR, WALTER, M.P. for Berkshire, the Defender
of Right; and, as he will have sundry costs to pay, it would be but a
graceful thing if all the readers of Parliamentary jebates were to raise
a fund to pay them for him. Of course, he would hand the money to
some charity, and thus two good things would be done. We could
indicate the most appropriate receptacle for such charity, under the
circumstances; but this might offend MR. WAsoN.
Another Clerical Caper.
THE unlucky parson who wants to be set up as an Opposition prelate
to DR. ColeNso, Lord Bishop of Natal, has been induced, it is said,
by a recent promotion, to believe that he has no chance of getting
qualified here, so he takes himself off to the Cape. A voyage that way
improves certain wine, but we never heard that it would do any good
to small beer. The Natalians will decline to have anything to do with
him—they are merry colonists, and cut Capers.
FRANK.
At the first meeting of the Reform League after the fatal election
day, MR. BEALEs stated that he should have been elected if it had not
been for the police, who hindered his friends. This is not unlikely.

ELECTION REPORTS.
- HERE has been a large cir-

affecting many of those, both

when the lawyers, and the
printers, and the publicans
have got in their harvest, and
the bill-sticking (and the bill-

very best authority, to have
taken a leading part in a
great Duke's great battue,

weekly numbers illustrated; that he did not lay, with Masonic rites, the founda-
tion-stone of a Particular Baptist chapel at Shrewsbury, when Member for that
borough; that he had never killed a fox; that he did not induce M.R. GATHoRNE
HARDy to sing comic songs to his own accompaniment whenever he dined with
him; and—worst of all—that he did not take a new greatcoat which belonged to
somebody else, after one of the Countess of DERBY's Assemblies. -
The University of London before electing MR. Lowe were satisfied, on strict
inquiry, that there was no truth in the allegation that he sympathised with canni-

Those who knew SIR John PARINGTON best were slow to believe that he had
for years been in the habit of subscribing secretly and largely in support of
Mormonism.

At Bristol, MR. SAMUEL MoRLEY found it advisable to publish handbills denying

THE OLD TORY'S YOUNG DAYS.
(Occasional Song at an Election Dinner.)
O Those old days when I was young,
We ne'er again such times shallsee,
When horse and sheepstealers were hung,
And likewise rogues for forgery!
Then thieves and robbers had their due,
By twenty at a time upstrung;
A spectacle not rare to view
In those old days when I was young.
Sing foodle, doodle, doodle doo.
It is a chorus which was sung,
Before your fathers dreamt of you,
In those old days when I was young.
Then, when a rabble raised its head
Against the Government and Crown,
The Riot Act forthwith was read,
Thereon the mob at once put down.
The Law and Judges then could teach
A demagogue to hold his tongue.
None of your liberty of speech
In those old days when I was young!
Sing, &c.
Our food was cheap then; poultry, meat,
For those who had the cash to buy.
We grew the bread we used to eat;
ere happy when its price was high.
The beer we brewed, bright, brisk and strong,
Was kept in barrels, under bung:
No *. ever did it wrong
In those old days when I was young.
Sing, &c.
-
'Tis true no railways then we had;
Folks were contented still to keep.
Tº wanted not about to gad
When they could quiet sit or sleep.
And if they were obliged to roam,
To their firesides in mind they clung,
And wished they were again at i.
In those old days when I was young.
Sing, &c.
People, to travel who had need,
Coaches with ample means supplied,
Or, rather than on foot proceed,
Ön horseback gentiºmen could ride.
The surgeons had some work to do
On them that were upset, or flung,
But monster accidents we knew
Not in the days when I was young.
Sing, &c.
No telegrams, with fresh alarm,
Disturbed our minds from day to day.
Few letters ever plagued the farm,
High postage if we had to pay.
'Tis said taxation crippled trade;
But land was not so hardly wrung:
Succession duty not yet laid
On in the days when I was young.
Sing, &c.
Much India-rubber we had not,
And gutta percha we had none.
Now we’ve enough of both, I wot;
That’s the chief good Free Trade has done.
We all did very well without
All those light wines that up have sprung;
Drank port and sherry, ale and stout,
In those old days when I was young.
Sing, &c.

over, he is an Alderman. Qf course, this could not beforgotten on the
hustings. “A Cockney Alderman, who knows nothing of Scotland,
has been brought away from his turtle and champagne, to disturb our
representation.” However, the Cockney Alderman came in triumph-
antly, even though, as has been pathetically remarked, he did not show
the quickness of Mr. PARKER, and learn up a bit of BURNS, . He
might as well have taken this trouble, as his doing so would have
afforded an innocent pleasure to the electors, and one of BURNs's best
songs is specially connected with the shire SIR SYDNEY represents.

SIR SYDNEY WATERLow begs us to say that he meant to have given
this, ore rotundo, from the hustings, and will do so on his re-election.
In the meantime, and by way of a reward to the Dumfries men for
having despised the old-fashioned cant about Cockneys, Mr. Punch
informs Scotland generally that SIR SYDNEY WATERLow is about as
like the typical London Alderman, who “wallows in turtle” (as dear
old SIBTHoRº used to say of the Whi Ministers), as Ben Nevis is like
Primrose Hill. He is, personally—Mr. Punch's right to personality is
a divine right—a tall and handsome man, who would look very well in
the garb of old Gaul; nextly, he is a travelled gentleman, and, whatever
he may know about Scotlan , knows a deal about the East; and, finally,
e is an energetic labourer in the good work of improving the dwellings
of the humbler classes. Mr. Punch is not much in the habit of raising
people, remembering Sir Peter Teazle's dictum thereament; but the
exceeding good behaviour of Scotland upon the present occasion merits
guerdon. Punch bides by the Buff and the Blue, when the Buffers
who sport it are True Blue.
PUNCH*S DREAM OF 1868.
ONCE when prophets were loud on the changes to be,
After England had taken her Leap in the Dark–
How tails in the places of heads we should see,
And strange creatures gathered in Westminster's Ark,
I, Punch, dreamed a dream", which I hear has come true—
How nought was so like the Old House as the New.
Her Leap in the Dark, they say, England has taken,
And, as far as she knows, found no mischief therefrom :
Not e'en shooting Niagara seems to have shaken
John BULL's constitution, in spite of old Tom.
And those who count heads or count noses, aver,
That the New House's motto will be, “As you were !”
One change we shall see—“ins” and “outs” shifting sides,
But its heads won't be fuller, its pockets less full;
Some sense it will lack, and some nonsense besides;
More decorous it may be, it must be more dull.
We may miss the good work that a BRUCE might have dome,
Or, when flat, sigh for BERNAL to poke us some fun.
So they say: so I said: and I thought of my dream,
And on Poor Humanity’s text, “As you were:”
And pond'ring that text for my next sermon's theme,
Ere I knew it, had dozed off again in my chair,
And with my head running on things old and new,
Dreamed again, and I’ll tell you my Dream number two.
Methought that I walked in a wood wild and wide,
Where many men walked, among pathways that spread
In maze labyrinthine, on every side,
And this way and that way those wanderers led :
But so devious the tracks, and the pathways so crost,
No wayfarer tried tº sm but soon he seemed lost.
Now hither now thither, mow forward now back,
I saw them still stumbling, and blund'ring along :
Yet none would confess he had strayed from the track,
But declared himself wirit", or her wayfarers wrong :
And to hard words and even to blows they would fall
O'er a “whither” and “whence” that was myst'ry to all.
Oh, many the pit-fall where wayfarers ſell,
And were smothered, or struggled, half choked, back to air,
And many the furze-brake and thorn guarded dell.
Where they stuck, sunk, or scrambled, all bleeding and bare.
Yet now and again would these wand’rers form bands,
And cheer and halloo, and as comrades join hands
Till it happed while I watched, how to left hand and right
The tumbling, and stumbling, and blundering went on,
Of a clearing .. wand'rers had struggled to sight,
Still at odds with each other which way they had gone:
Some declaring 'twas forward, and some that’twas Back,
And each chiding the other for blocking the track.
But now when they met at this clearing, behold,
Under two heads the wand'rers confusedly drew—
And the downcast grew cheerful, the cowards grew bold,
As no pitfalls they’d 'scaped, and no thorns struggled thro’—
And all sung in a chorus, complacent and clear—
“Our wand'rings are ended—our haven is here !”
“They told us the road that we took led to woe,
That darkness and danger surrounded our way;
But we went on, nor heeded the warning, and lo!
We have found * places, and fair light of day;
Nought is changed save for better: Earth's Eden is here:
Then Halloo—boys Halloo! Of the wood we are clear !”
Then I saw in my dream, how surrounding the wood,
Where those wayfarers halted to raise that halloo,
Vague shapes, lovely some, and some terrible, stood—
ut of º air or fearful, was none that I knew.
“And be they for evil,” I thought, “ or for good,”
“You were best not halloo, till you’re out of the wood | *

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITH A NOSE.-HE MERGES INTO THE GENUS
“LIVERY-MAN.”
To College PUTTYK's nose, so to speak, followed him. It saved him,
I believe, from attendance at lectures, for what lecturer on classics or
mathematics would of his own accord invite the presence of a constant
interruption, which he was utterly powerless to stop?
For if PUTTYK was asked to try his hand at a passage in Herodotus,
in which he was only put on with the design of stopping his nose
PUTTYK would get over two lines of open Greek country at a fair pace
and then, seeing what Americans call “a difficulty” (with them its
meaning would be illustrated by a precipice in front and a mad bull in
the rear during your afternoon’s quiet walk), would come to a standstill
and take refuge behind his pocket-handkerchief. The Lecturer, at first
would be inclined to wait patiently till PUTTYK had finished; but you
might safely back PUTTYK’s nose against the Lecturer for holding out.
So the “call,” as convivialists say, being with the Lecturer, another
Undergraduate was “called” upon for a translation, and not until the
Lecturer had got well into some learned explanation of a phrase, or
was bringing £ºi a variety of proofs, or disproofs, of the Greek
historian's veracity, would PUTTYK's nose turn up again.
“I think, MR. PUTTYK,” said the Lecturer to him, choosing, in the
most gentlemanly and kindly manner, the conclusion of his hour after
the dismissal of the class, for his “word with PUTTYK,” “you might
manage to control the noise; for you see it disturbs everyone, and robs
us of at least fifteen out of our sixty minutes.”
PUTTYK was most apologetic: “It was a source,” he said, “ of far
greater annoyance to him than it could even be to theiecturer." He
was afraid”—here he became melancholy—“it was a disease. He had
deferred consulting doctors about it, but now he should certainly do so.”
It was a difficult case; for if PUTTYK’s nose was a bond ſide affliction,
not even a College Don—no, nor the Master of the College himself—
could have the heart to insist upon a man overcoming an illness on the
spot, as it were, or getting rid of a disease “to order,” so that he
might attend his duties in hall, chapel, and lecture-room. It was like
saying, “Be quite well to-morrow at ten o'clock, or rustication will be
your portion.
So, gradually PUTTYK’s name dropped off the Marker's list, and
Lecturers never summoned him to their schools, nor complained of his
non-attendance, too pleased at his absence to express more than a
assing regret that such a promising young man should be debarred
§ †fi. is, nasal) causes from filling his pails at the College
fountains.
PUTTYK’s was not a mere excuse: like the guide who came at last to
take his own lies for historical facts, PUTTYK soon worked himself into
a belief in his own theory.
He was worth four customers at least to his haberdasher in pocket-
handkerchiefs, and to his laundress in washing them.
I have been with him to the theatre, and have seen an entire audience,
justly irritated by his interruptions, hiss his unfortunate nose, while
the §: himself has begged him to accept his entrance-money
and retire. Tragedians have scowled at him while taking poison, and
villains of the deepest dye have directed their last curses at him as they
were borne off, struggling, in the arms of the officers of dramatic justice.
fiave seen aii the fun taken out of a Low Comedian by one blow of
PUTTYK’s nose: I have heard the finest tenor's finest chest-note
pitched in vain contention with this remarkable organ.
PUTTYK awake is powerful, but PUTTYK asleep is irresistible. If
you want to give a dull, long-winded preacher a hint, take my friend
with you, after a good lunch, to an afternoon’s service in winter time.
He will fall as fast asleep as Eutychus, and the greatest pulpit-orator
will not make headway against him. " .
As I have said, the Man with a Nose, becoming aware of his own
nuisance, forms an explanatory, theory on the subject, and, after con-
sulting several medical friends (whose advice he doesn’t follow unless
it jumps with his theory), and after some superficial examination of
medical treatises, with a view to establishing his theory, finally decides
that his (which no one can persuade him is simply the consequence of a
nervous habit) is a most extraordinary case arising entirely from Liver.
It is at this point that my Man with a Nose is merged into the Man
with a Liver; or, to put it more delicately, a Livery-Man, say, of the
City of London. Some one or some book has shown him that the cause
of most ailments is Liver: his nose-difficulty is an ailment: ergo, the
cause is Liver.
PUTTYK made this discovery early in life, two years after he had
quitted the University. From that moment he became a perambu-
lating druggist's shop. Pills were in his waistcoat-pockets: if he sat
down suddenly he was soon reminded of the existence of various draughts
in phials in his coat-tails; he had a minim glass and a larger one
marked with the quantities held by tea or tablespoons, in his breast-
pocket; prescriptions were in his trouser-pockets, ready for an emer.
gency in case he should travel and find himself without a supply.
y
| Since PUTTYK has become a Liveryman, he has, I am glad to say,
ceased to be, regularly, the Man with the Nose. At intervals there is
a return of the organ with all its old trumpet power; but these relapses
are few and far between.
But now PUTTYK has always something the matter with him, and I
don’t wonder at it.
| Tell him that (as is the fact) he looks the picture of health, he will
smile at you, and shake his fuzzy head. “Only the picture, my dear
fellow,” he will reply, with a mournful enjoyment of his sad state—
“only the picture, not the reality.”
“But,” I say to him heartily determined, if I can, to shake him out
of his hypochondria, “I never saw you looking better.”
“Very likely,” he will return in a resigned tone, as if his hours were
numbered, and your dinner with him to-night is to be the last, in this
world at all events.
“I know what it is,” he says, cheerfully,
A friend suggests walking exercise. “
walk.” Regularly £ “Regularly.”
Then another recommends idiº; “He does ride,” he replies,
becoming somewhat irritable. “Ah! but not every day,” his adviser
says. ... “Yes,” says PUTTYK, boldly stretching a point, “I do; at
least,” he interpolates as a correction, so as to save himself from a
positive untruth, “every day I possibly can.”
You’ll never see PUTTYK wift a pain somewhere. He acts con-
cealment, occasionally, of his miseries. He will breathe hard while
speaking to you, and put his hand to his side. You stop—what is the
matter? othing,” answers PUTTYK the martyr, affecting to hide
his agony and return to the subject of conversation. This is done only
in the presence of an unbeliever, who, he’ll tell his friend afterwards, he
was afraid would have laughed because he didn't understand his case.
He does not, like my relative mentioned incidentally in the sketch of
the Man with an Ear, complain of loss of appetite, and then fill his
* º himself from every dish and bottle (except the water one) on
: the table.
| No (he is a first-rate gourmet, by the way, and you can do worse
than dine with PUTTYK), he professes an appetite; but he calls it a
deceptive sign. He eats of everything generally, “Just to taste it, to
see if the cook has exactly followed out his directions.” He is, at all
his meals, in a chronic state of poisoning and antidote.
He commences dinner with two pills in half a tumbler of water, as a
general corrective, and generally tells you, if you make any observation
on the practice, that “you’re a lucky fellow to be able to do without 'em.”
The soup he may only just touch, but he asks the servant in waiting,
| “Has MRs. LUCAs, the cook, put sherry in it ** John doesn’t know.
PUTTYK tries it. “If there’s sherry in it, it will play the deuce with
| him,” he tells us. However, he doesn’t think there is º flavour of
wine being as palpable as it should be) and eats a plateful. Between
the courses he . WILLIAM, the page, and gives him minute instruc-
|tions as to where he’ll find, in his bed-room, a small bottle labelled
with CARRICK the Chemist's label and his directions. WILLIAM
returns with it, and PuttyR, who has in the meantime explained the
properties of this draught, which appear, to be antagonistic to sherry
and º empties it into a wine-glass and drinks it off.
| Now he says it doesn't matter if he does take a glass of sherry, and
he accordingly takes that and another.
| Fish invariably disagrees with him, except done in a particular way.
|This is done in a particular way by his particular directions, and he
partakes of it heartily. When finished, John arrives from the kitchen
with an apology from cook, saying that “she had been unable to
manage the fish as Master wanted it, but—”
There is no but. , PUTTYK is angry it wasn’t mentioned before; how-
ever, it is not too late, there is a remedy. WILLIAM is summoned, and
informed that, “in the top drawer, on the right-hand side of the chest
of drawers on the right, not the first, but the second, nearer the looking-
glass; does he understand?” to which he says “Yes,” and looks hope.
fº helpless. But we hear him asking John outside, “What he did
say, blessed if he knew.” Thence WiiLIAM will bring down a small
square blue box, labelled “To be taken during meals.” This, says
PUTTYK, is a French remedy, and an admirable one. We warn him
against his nostrums; but you might as well tell the Monument not to
stand on Fish Street Hill. He won't hear, and he won’t be moved.
He has up, for his guests, some rare champagne. “ Champagne is
death to him,”, he tells us; “but, on this occasion—” and so
|WILLIAM is again dispatched, and this time returns with a full-grown
medicine-chest., PUTTYK apologises for its appearance, and º his
leaving the table for one moment to go to the sideboard where he
doctors himself (I think, this time, homoeopathically), and returns to the
head of the table. So the dinner proceeds. Afterwards, though we
prefer getting to our cigars and coffee at once, Puttyk insists upon our
tasting some of the Port wine and the Claret, which comes from his
father's cellar on purpose for us; “We will,” he says, “get to pipes
and cigars when we take our Grog.” Grog' after all this. So we,
out of politeness, taste his wines, which are excellent, but unnecessary.
Judging by myself next morning, I don't wonder, if this is PUTTYK's
usual course, at his never being well.

letter and the spirit of the English Church as set forth in the Articles

persond, to give us his explanation.
MR. MAchoNochi E was then called and examined.
First, said the learned Commissioner, as to the two lighted candles
on the Communion-table during the Communion service. They are not
lighted for the purpose of giving light? ..
Mr. Machonochie. No. They are symbolical: and direct the thoughts
of my congregation to the True Light. It is an ancient practice of the
Church Catholic. It is used in all branches of the Church.
Commissioner. So much I find in DR. Rock's Hierurgia, a Roman
Catholic book on ceremonies. Your reason, then, for lighting them is,
first, because you consider them as aids to devotion. secondly, because
of their antiquity; thirdly, because such is the use of the Greek and
Roman Churches P
Mr. Machonochie. Precisely so.
Commissioner. I see, Sir, that I may trust you to answer my questions
honestly and fearlessly. iſ now come to Number Two-the elevation of
the consecrated elements. - -
Mr. Machonochie. The lifting up is in illustration of the
§. by the lifting up of the brazen serpent. It is
elevated, so that all the people in church may see and adore.
É. action
ted up, or
Commissioner. Quite so: and honestly answered. Now, in your
answer you have just given is involved the answer to Number Three.
Why do you kneel after the “consecration”?
Mr. Machonochie. I kneel to adore.
Commissioner. Now, MR. MACHONochir, I am sure you are too {
sensible, not to say too pious, a man and clergyman to give adoration
where it is not due. You would not, that is, adore a piece of bread?
You would abominate such a motion.
oºi. Undoubtedly. My adoration is paid to Its Highest
Ject.
Commissioner, I am sure of it, Sir. But why on that special occa-
sion, after the Consecration and at the Elevation ?
Mr. Machonochie. Because the Highest Object is then specially pre-
sent. Understand me, Sir, I do not ; transubstantiation or consub-
stantiation—both are equally forbidden by our Articles. But I believe
in a Special Presence, which no word can adequately express.
Commissioner. Setting aside the name as a mere jºi. question,
do you believe that aº miracle is worked by }. hands the same
in effect as is believed by persons belonging to those Churches, to be
worked by a Roman Catholic Priest, or a Greek Priest, at their Com-
munion Services.
. Mr. Machonochie. Yes, undoubtedly. For I have the same power by
virtue of my orders to perform the same sacrificial act as they perform,
and I am as much a Priest as is sº Catholic clergyman.
Commissioner. MR. John BULL, MR. MARTIN, and Gentlemen of the
Church of England, MR. MachoNochik has spoken out fearlessly and
honestly. For my part I have no hesitation in deciding that his form
of worship, logically consistent with his belief, has no place in the
fstablished Church of these realms. We will not, as he will not, stickle
for names. He believes in a miraculous change in the elements which,
though he cannot call it Transubstantiation, because the word is literally
forbidden by our Articles, is the same thing to all intents and purposes as
what Roman Catholics mean by their name for it, and involves the lead-
ing Roman Catholic tenet, which it was one of the chief objects of the
Reformation emphatically to condemn and utterly sweep away. For
if we do not stickle for names in any case, what difference is there

--
THE TWO SIDI.S OF T.I., S.11).Lº.
MR. Pusch found the following in a recent copy of the ºndari,
and he thinks it exceedingly just. Attacking a contemporary for
alleged partiality to its party—the Standard says:–
“Every Liberal Member is in its columns an angel of light and purity; -
every Conservative a bigot and an oppressºr, a foe to freedom, civil and ie-
ligious, in this country and elsewhere. If a Conservative writer ventures to
say a word for the working-man he is hypocritically touting for votes. . If a
Tory landowner, through his agent, requests his tenants to vote as they please,
he is guilty of an impertinence; if he is silent, he is, of course, guilty of
coercion. So we learn that every Radical meeting is unanimous, enthusiastic,
a noble demonstration, a convincing expression of electoral sentiment; whilst
a Conservative gathering has no importance whatever, is a packed assembly
or ticketed mass of unintelligence.”
Just so; and a curious coincidence the other side says that,
mutatis mutandis, this is the exact way that the Conservatives describe
Liberals and their doings. , Suppose then, instead of such incrimi-
nations, each side tried to be fair. Only then the papers would be
dull reading. True, we forgot that; and things had better go on as
they are. -

Explanation.
A LADY of Stepney requests us to say that she has read a cock-and-
bull story about a pillar letter-box in that district suddenly exploding,
a gas-pipe being accused of having leaked into it. She wishes justice
to be done, even to gasmen (though they do cheat, and she d.
believe in the meter a bit), and she thinks it right to say that, havin
good cause and occasion to rebuke her husband very severely, she di
so in a letter which she posted in the box in question. What exploded
she has no doubt was her Blowing-Up letter, as her husband has never
apologised.

FUEL SAVED BY FELT.
Professor Jevons, and other men of science, differ in their esti-
mates of the time which we shall take in using up all our coal, at Qur
present rate of consumption. Is there no remedy for this consumption
of the coal? Economy, if the Government could enforce it; but
Government can’t. All that we can do, therefore, is to economise,
as well as we may, our own private and particular coal measures,
namely, certain, quantities, deposited from sacks, in cellars not com:
taining more than a few tons. One way of doing this is that of
adopting a method of dressing meat, most truly described by a con-
temporary as–
“SENSIBLE Cooking.—The Norwegian felted boxes now on sale in Duke
Street, Grosvenor Square, deserves notice. When a leg of mutton is to be
boiled, instead of its being kept on the fire for three or four hours (on the good
old English method, which wastes fuel and hardens the meat), it is sufficient
to keep it boiling for only ten minutes; and when it has been boiled for that
time, the fire is no longer needed, but the saucepan containing the meat is to
be inclosed in the rited box tiii three or four hours later, when dinner-time
arrives. The heat in the saucepan is prevented from escaping, as it cannot
pass through the non-conducting felt, and the process of cooking therefore
goes on gently for hours with no new application of heat. A leg of mutton
eaten by the Food Committee is stated to have been quite hot three hours and
a half after it was taken from the fire and inclosed in the box.”
Another leg is said to have been brought from Paris to London in a
Norwegian box without flºº. The Norwegians know the
value ; fuel, and they have also known how to make fuel go as far as
it can in boiling meat. Their felted box is a contrivance for boxing
heat up, so as to compel a given quantity of heat to do all the cooking
that it can, and to render the generation of any additional heat
and therefore the combustion of any, more fuel, needless. ...Your
felt, you see, Ma'am, keeps your boiling water hot. How
Because it is what you may call a cad on the step of an omnibus—a
bad conductor. The Norwegian felted box must be a real blessing to
servants as well as to housekeepers, in summer no less, if not
Inore º than in winter. tºuring hot weather your cook
would like to put the fire in the kitchen out as soon as possible. In
the case of boiled meat your felted box makes this possible as soon as
the meat has been boiled ten minutes. In these days there are
many persons who find it a very hard matter to make the pot boil.
The difficulty of effecting that object, occasioned by the present
extravagance in female dress, under a thousand a year, keeps many
young people single. It certainly has been simplified, and persons
about to marry are enabled to do so on proportionally lower terms, by
the invention of the Norwegian felted box.
THE MEMBER FOR GREENWICH.
THE graceful GLApston E has been rejected in Lancashire for a
gentleman who is so large in the girth that, when, he had to be girt
with the sword it was impossible to make the ends of the belt meet.
The electors have preferred a big man to a great one. However, if
MR. GLADstone ever condescends to stand again for the district that
has shown such bad taste, he had better previously go through a long
course of the dinners the idea of which is the only one that arises when
his present borough is mentioned. We shall have great pleasure in
dining with him at Greenwich, (at the national expense, of course,) four
times a week until further notice. The hotels are kept open in the
winter. The splendid conceptions which MR. GLADstoNE and
PUNCH will strike out during these repasts will amply repay the
country for the six or eight guineas which each may cost; ºf i.
the latter gentleman happen to recollect any part of the conversation,
he may give it to the world in his own columns. He heartily congratu-

In the case of a Duke, an Earl, a Bishop, a Nobleman of any rank,
a Baronet, a º a Barrister, a Clergyman, an Alderman even, the
victim of a railway accident, what would be thought of a reporter
writing as follows?—
“It was at first thought that some of the unfortunate fellow's ribs were
broken. Such is not the case, though he has sustained some internalinjury
about the chest.”
This is an extract from a contemporary’s account of an “Alarming
Railway Collision.” The sufferer described as “the unfortunate
fellow” was the driver of an express run into by a mineral train. No
doubt he was an unfortunate fellow. Every fellow who meets with a
bad accident is an unfortunate fellow. But that is not what a reporter
would call any fellow, who had come to grief in a first-class carriage.
He would describe any such fellow as “the unfortunate gentleman.”
A small shopkeeper, in a similar case, but second class, he would pro-
bably term “the unfortunate man.” First Class and Second Class
passengers, ſº in his momenclature, respectively, to gentleman
and man. Third Class, mechanics and their like, answer to Fellows.
When he º: of an engine-driver, hurt by a collision, as “the un-
fortunate fellow,” he inspires us with mere sympathy for the engine-
driver, whereas, if he applied the same description to a bruised trades-
man well-to-do, not to mention a peer or a prelate, he would amuse
some of us, shock others, and rather astonish everybody. Yet, on the
principle of equality, we are all fellows, only some are finer fellows than
othersi." they are fellows never reported as such in our British

RUSSIFICATION UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
The Pall Mall Gazette, in one of its occasional notes, publishes the very natural
complaint of a conscientious Russian school-inspector in Lithuania. ..
Russia is benevolently anxious to Russify—another, and rather different word
for civilising—this part of her Holy Empire. - - -
Now, it is notorious that polish can’t be diffused without extirpating Polish, and
accordingly Russ law forbids the use of that demoralising language in the Polish
schools of Lithuania. , But the perverse little wretches who, attend them are
guilty of talking Polish with their fathers and mothers when they go home, and
thus all the Russ varnish so laboriously laid on in their school-hours during the day
is rubbed off every night. M. BATouschkoff, the zealous school-inspector, who
makes the complaint, draws the obvious conclusion, that unless the Polish children
are entirely removed from the influence of their parents, there can be no real Russi-
fication. Still, he does not propose to punish the parents, as one might expect, for
talking to their little ones in what he mildly calls their “pernicious” native tongue.
He contents himself with the charitable, observation, that “these imprudent
§. do not understand what a demoralising influence they exercise on their
children.”
For the present, he contents himself with recommending, “as a preliminary
measure, that all children, except those who live with their parents, should, after
the hours of study, be placed under the surveillance of committees composed of
educational officials.”
Happy little Lettish-Poles' Blessed with the perpetual guidance and example
of their, Russ pastors and masters—not only in, but out of, school-hours!. Ah, if
we had but the paternal Czarism of Russia established among us for a Session |
But we cannot understand why M. BAToUschkoff, who sees the evil so clearly
stops so lamentably short in the remedy... He proposes, we have seen, to put all
the Polish little ones under official surveillance, “except those who live with their
parents.” Why, it is just the º children who do live with their parents
who are tº: by the “permicious.” Polish element'
What M. BAToUschkoff ought to have recommended is the substitution of Russ
remplarants for Polish parents throughout Lithuania. Thus he would have struck
at the root of that “pernicious” national feeling which neutralises all Russia's
benevolent efforts at Russification. She will never stifle
the language unless, she can put down, the parents; Till
she has done that, her mission of civilisation will be but
half accomplished.

BAITED CIRCULARS.
MR. PUNCH,
..I AM old enough to be the father of grown-up º but
I am neither a father nor a husband. It is well. A wife of nearly my
own age would most likely not be so hale and strong as I am. The
only delight she could well afford me would be that of alleviating her
numerous complaints, and of this pleasure I should be very much
deprived by narrow circumstances. The same limitation would forbid
me to make my children happy. As for my daughters, if I had any,
they could not, for ºf could do, but be the reverse of happy.
My means would not enable them to appear in the expensive dresses
now exacted by society, and as necessary, with any view to matrimony,
as the silk, and hackle, and gold and silver thread, with which hooks
are adorned to make artificial flies, and catch trout.
Puffing linen-drapers, however, Sir, are unaware both of my
indigence and celibacy. At least they are ignorant of the latter;
knowledge of the former would probably not prevent them from sending
their circulars. to my abode, on the chance of tempting thoughtless
girls, or a foolish old woman to mis-spend money, run me up a bill, Or
COax, Or ºff. me into extravagance.
Messrs. TAGG AND RAGG, the other day, sent me one of their
announcements of sales of depreciated stock, accompanied by three
different specimens of silk, with their respective prices. The least
costly was 60s, the dress, the next 75s, the highest 78s. 6d.
“WALKER!” was the exclamation which audibly burst from my lips,
as, winking mine eye at TAGG AND RAGG in idea, I pressed my thumb
hard on the end of my nose, and forcibly twiddled my fingers.
“Ah!” thought I, “how many a poor fellow like myself, and having
incumbrances which I am not saddled with, has been let in by means
of that circular and its enclosed patterns for from fourteen or fifteen to
twenty or thirty pounds if not more l’”
“Matrimony,” said Íñ. JoHNson, “has many pains, and celibacy
few pleasures.” Sir, I experienced one of its pleasures as I cast the
silken baits for my imagined females into the fire, and proceeded to
convert the paper which had contained them into spills. Which
whilst I used from time to time in lighting my pipe, I tried to work
myself into a state of mind approaching to content with my lot by
comparing it with what it might be if f were poor PATERFAMILLAs,
and not DioGENEs TUBhouse.
P.S. Whenever a weak sense of loneliness comes over me, I comfort
myself with the reflection that, whilst others are necessitated to incur
linendrapers' charges, my whole expenditure on apparel is limited to
infrequent transactions at the ready-made clothes-shop.

[December 12, 1868.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN ARCHIDIACONAL FUNCTION.
From ARCHDEACON PUNCH to all Ritualists in his Archdeaconry.
GENTLEMEN,
I KNow, and you will not deny it, that you avowedly and
openly hear confessions. I feel it my duty to make a few remarks
npon a letter to the REy, JAs. A. ANDERSON, O.S.A., a Catholic priest,
from his Bishop, DR. O'BRIEN. Here is the letter:-
“Waterford, Nov. 9, 1868.
* Rev. JAs. A., ANDERson, O.S.A., I hereby withdraw, from you, all fa-
culties and approbation to hear confessions from the date hereof within the
limits of the diocese of Waterford and Lismore.
“Yours faithfully,
+ D. O'BRIEN, Bishop.”
You see from this, Gentlemen, the system of the Roman Church.
The clerical practitioner is licensed to hear confession on the premises,
not off them, and that licence can be revoked by his superior. Your
Archdeacon, Gentlemen, is no admirer of the Confessional, and he looks
upon the Rubric as vaguely permissive in an extraordinary case, while
the form in the Visitation Service is, demonstrably, for a special case.
If the English Church Reformers had intended confession to be gene-
rally and usually practised, it would have been guarded as jealously as
it is in the Roman Church. But your Archdeacon wonders who is to
restrain you? You have no confessional boxes in open church, in the
sight of the entire congregation. No, your studies, your libraries,
your friends’ rooms, your vestries, your sacristies, these be your holes
and corners.
Would you not be astonished to read:—
- “To the REv. MACHONoch IE (e.g.), St. Alhams.
“I hereby withdraw from you all faculties and approbation to hear
confessions, from the date hereof, within the limits of the diocese of
London. “T. LONDON.”
Of course you would be astonished.
But I, as your Archdeacon, must put a prior question; namely, “Have
K. ever, received ‘such faculties or approbation from your Bishop.”
o, Have you ever asked for them?”. No. I advise you to ask for
such licence at once. Let all Ritualistic clergymen apply for their
licences to their respective diocesans. -
I do not, I will not, anticipate the answer, but if the powers exist
you will obtain your licences. w -
Everybody can keep wine and spirits in his cellar, but everyone ma
not retail them to customers.
Gentlemen, as your Venerable Archdeacon, I agree with you that,
having due regard to your liberty, you are better placed as Anglican
Clergymen than if (which with your opinions you might easily do) you
joined the Church of Rome. 3. you’d be laymen, . have to
make, not hear confessions.
There you’d be taught, not allowed to teach.
There, if you would be Priests and hear confessions, 'twill be under
grave restrictions.
Or if you are, as I trust most of you happily are, married, you could
not, if you would, be a Priest at all.
But, Gentlemen, why move, when you can hold all Roman doctrine,
hear confessions, absolve, expound antiquity, and be married ? Wos estis
Di, diri. Better to be Popes all, than serve one.
... Gentlemen, may your Priestesses convert you to an honest mind, or
if they will not, but on the contrary, be inclined to agree with you (as
even good wives sometimes will) why then do you be FATHER DARBY,
let her reverence be Pope JoAN, and hear the young ladies' confessions.
But, ah, me! I tremble to think of the penances. "I am, faithfully,
Your Venerable Archdeacon,
39QANTHQ.
P.S. And to you, my dear Bishop of ELY, yours and many of 'em.
You are wrong, my dear Lord, in your supposition that because Prayers
de mortuis were officially pronounced not #. in that celebrated case
that therefore “A Mass for the Repose of a Soul,” as performed by
that Clergyman of the Established Church in your Lordship's diocese,
at Cambridge is permissible as a corollary. If you think so, my
Lord, then permit me to say that on this point you are no theologian,
and perhaps don’t want to be.
Acclimatisation Overdone.
So, Australia is in danger of being eaten up by the progeny of
rabbits imported from the mother country. The Australians shoul
import foxes to keep them down. It must be understood that the too
prolific rabbit of New South Wales is a totally different creature from
the Welsh rabbit.
UNPOPULAR OPERA JUST Now.—The Trova-tory.

IXION'S FALL.
Ixion scaled Olympus; with the Immortals
Like an Immortal sat, and held his own :
Made mocks at Jove, and even passed the portals
Of the Great Queen and whispered by her throne.
Flung topsy-turvy the Olympian board, -
And taught its gods their natures to reverse:
Made Bacchus drop his cup, and Mars his sword,
Turned Venus vestal, and Minerva worse.
Daring—for what had he not braved, defiant.
Of low beginnings, to reach realms so high
As tough in purpose as in practice pliant;
Still keeping on his goal a single eye.
Merging all arts in one, the art to rise,
Holding no way forbid that upward led:
Scorning all bars between him and his prize–
And leader most, when seeming to be led
Marking his feats of wit, his force of will,
His victories o'er scorn and low estate, .
We own, were greatness but successful skill,
Ixion well had earned the title “Great.”
But as men's greatness never yet has stood
Gauged by the height they of reach but to fall;
As will and power to do great things and good,
Make mortals great, who wanting these are small,
Ixion, at his highest, stood but low ;
Andrew there are will grieve his fall to see,
Who nought beyond himself.e'er seemed to know ;
And, not being god-like, claimed a god to be.
And if, when he aspired to fold a Queen,
A phantom cloud to his embrace was given;
If, when he thought Jove's master to have been,
He found himself hurled down by Jove from Heaven,
'Tis only Justice, nor can we desire,
Nor he hope, to Olympus his return :
His fate is in the metherworld of fire,
Bound to a wheel, to turn, and turn, and turn.
That wheel, his fitting punishment who taught,
The Ruler's Art was but to turn in time;
That nether world, with keener suffering fraught,
For him who had the strength so high to climb.
But hark' Ixion's voice,—whose courage strove
With pain, defiant still though faint and floored:–
“Deem me not from Olympus kicked by Jove,
If I’ve come down, 'tis of my own accord.”
A LONG SHRIFT.
THE Pope, waking up with a Happy Thought, suddenly cut off the
heads of a couple of men who were sentenced about a year and a
|. ago. Their crime was a dastardly one, worthy of Fenians, and
their fate needs no pity. But the Italians are making a grievance of
it, and calling it an insult to Italy, because these criminals blew up a
barrack of sleeping soldiers who were among the guards of Rome.
With all Punch's desire to see that done for the Pope which Catholics
desire to see done for the Irish Church, he cannot applaud the Italian
demonstration, which is justified only by the dogma that we may do
evil that good may come. Only, we should have thought that short
shrift might have met the justice of the case. As our friend SIR
GEORGE Bowy ER has leisure from Parliamentary duties (and we are
sorry for it, as also that the two excellent English Catholics, LoRD
Eowann Howard and Sir Joſis AgtoN, are out), perhaps he will,
taking competent time to ascertain, tell us why it took fifteen months
to “justify” a couple of assassins.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 253
ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITH AN EYE.
IN the kingdom of the blind the Man with an Eye would be king.
But as it doesn't happen to the Man with an Eye to live in a “Blind
Country.”—which I suppose a hunting man would define as a country
full of blind hedges and blind ditches—he erects himself into an abso-
lute monarchy, and pities those who with their two eyes are not blessed
with such correct powers of vision—which are indeed but visionary
powers—as he is with his one.
Not that he hasn’t got two good useful serviceable eyes. He has: but
he always prefers to speak of them, as the French republic, one and
indivisible.
. He will fell you that he has “an eye for colouring.” Which eye it
is he doesn’t say. He has also “an eye for effect.” Perhaps it’s the
other eye; not the one he uses for colour.
He has got “an eye to the main chance,” like a raven “twigging”
a worm upon which he’ll presently come down sharply, as with our
One-Eyed Calendar in his character of early bird on the main chance.
He has “an eye for comfort,” he has, generally speaking “an eye
for this sort of thing,” whatever it may be at the moment, and such an
§: as no one else possesses for the same thing, nor can he conceive
the possibility of there being another eye belonging to any other person
equal in any kind of way to his.
The question may occur to some, isn’t he rather an Argus, speaking ||
of everyone of his eyes individually, than a man of only one eye *
This he may be, but to all intents and purposes he is, in every case,
the one-eyed man.
BENTON, my one-eyed friend, is most annoying.
When he comes into the room, nothing is straight in his opinion.
You have a headache, perhaps, and having given up business for one
day only, you are sitting comfortably before your fire, with the tea and
toast of invalid tradition, when in comes BENTON of the Eye.
“My dear fellow, sorry to find you seedy; what is it?” And while
łº are answering, his eye is commencing a tour round the chamber.
t makes you fidgety; you know that something is wrong; you would
almost like to ward off the blow by telling him that “you know what
he is going to say,” only that this course you foresee may just draw on
}. the attack you want to avoid. For this power of the Eye, makes
ENton the most particular man you ever met. He is so neat in him-
self that he wouldn't even cock his hat on one side, not on account of
the raffish look, but because it would put his entire self, as it were, out
of the perpendicular. His rooms are the perfection of neatness and
good taste; there is no doubt about it. And while his Eye enables him
to pick holes, or rather to point out the holes, and then, by picking at
'em, to make 'em larger in other people's habits, yet there’s not one of
aff his acquaintance who can honestly point out a hole in his domestic
arrangements; that is, as to furniture, bric-à-brac, articles of virtu, or
the colour and position of any chair, curtain, stool, sofa, fire-screen, or
what-not from kitchen to attic in BENTON's chambers.
Therefore, being encased in mail himself, he can charge others fear-
lessly; but at the same time it is less in the spirit of a knight of the
tourney than in that of the crusader that BENTON brings his lance up
to the rest against you; for he wants to convert you from the error of
your ways. He would have you all as he is—all BENTON. “If his
standard of taste is correct, and it is admitted by his friends and ene:
mies to be admirable, and nearly perfect, what is not up to his standard,”
he argues, “comes short of it, and is not correct; that is, is incorrect.
If I am right,” he says, “You are wrong. There is a right and a wrong
in these matters, and it is wonderful to me,” continues BENTON, “how
men can i. On aSČ. do, allowing their rooms to be all higgledy pig-
gledy anyhow, and not taking a pride and pleasure in seeing them look
neat and artistic.”
This is dreadful when you’re unwell. You can only say, “Oh, dear, it
doesn’t matter,” or the here-to-day-and-gone-to-morrow theory, which,
BENTON, will at once (being a High Churchman and strongly Gothic)
tell you is not the way to look at anything however small; such a view
being the lowest old Pagan morality known to the ancients. Where-
upon (if your headache is really bad) you will say you “prefer being an
old Pagan moralist,” and will try to show by your manner that this is
where the full stop comes (stop, and count four) in the conversation,
“Not a bit,” BENTON says, standing up and putting his glass in his
eye (the eye), “my dear fellow; you haven’t got, that lamp straight.”
It is a hanging one, and the chains somehow or other never will remain
the same length for two days together. -
“I couldn’t stop in the room with such a thing as that,” says
BENTON, fidgeting. “It quite upsets me. 'Pon my life, Í don't
wonder you’re ill.” - -
“Well,” you say, feebly, “BETTY shall, put it to-rights; in fact,”
you add, suddenly admitting to yourself that you haven’t been strict
enough about these matters, and they ought really to take more care,
“I’ll speak to her sharply.” -
“I wouldn’t make a row about it,” says BENTON.—which is just his
annoying way—after stirring you up with a long pole as it were until
you’re only too glad to get some one on whom to let off your anger,
—he says, “Oh don’t make a fuss about it.”
“Fuss l’’; you growl, “surely ’tisn’t making a fuss to ask them why
the deuce they don’t hang a lamp properly—it’s too bad.” Here
BETTY enters in answer to your bell. She looks as if she had been
suddenly disturbed in commencing the colouring operations on her face
to quali y herself for a part in the Female Nigger Minstrels.
“BETTY,” says her master, in a tone enough to bring a pallor even
to her cheek, and the more startling seeing she had only expected to
be summoned either for more tea and toast, or to remove the tray, or for a
bottle of soda-water, or some such mild and gentle order in the way of
stimulants with which the headachy bachelor is apt to regale himself.
So BETTY looks for one second as if she’d seen a ghost, and the
next she braces herself up to meet “what’s a comin'!” -
“BETTY, why on earth can't you keep this lamp straight I’ve
been going to speak to 3. about it every day,”—this is your excuse
to her for being so suddenly furious; a mere excuse, which she sees
through, and you know she does too, and would give something if
BENTON hadn't come in with his confounded eye—“but I haven't,
because, somehow, it slipped my memory. Just see to it at once.”
And you look across at BENTON, as much as to say, “See what a Turk
I am when I like—there's a man of business for you!”
BETTY advances towards the lamp, and examines it cautiously. .
“She don’t think there ain't not much the matter with the lamp, it's
the chains as 'olds it: the man 'ad better come and do it, as she only
might break it a touchin of it, and that’s why she aven’t liked to do it
efore.”
“Then why not,” you ask still severely, for you feel you are
answered, and that BETTY has the best of it—always confounding that
fellow BENTON, who will interfere—“why not mention it to me, instead
of letting it go on in this way : * -
BETTY replies that “I’d ave a mentioned it, Sir, before, only that
MR. RIPPs up-stairs’aving a friend for a week, and MR.WIGGLEsworth
down-stairs 'aving just left down-stairs in order to let MR. BLAssoNE
as is going to 'ave a brass plate on the door; he’s a dentist, Sir, and
cleaning the house down, and one thing and another, it quite slipped
out of my thoughts.” - -
“Slipped: ” a quotation from your own speech a while ago. Things
have not hitherto gone so well for you during this scene that you can
afford a side-attack from BENTON, who says, as if remonstrating, mind,
with you for your harshness to the poor maid about such a petty matter
as the lamp not being straight, “ P dare say,” observes this traitor,
“BETTY has quite enough to do without looking after your lamps
hanging exactly as they ought,” (the double-faced villain), “and after
all it’s the proper hanger's business, not hers.” - -
You can’t say, before her, that, BENTON oughtn't to talk like this,
making you appear like a tyrant lodger to the servant.
When she is gone you will talk over this seriously with BENTON ;
and you will also find that you have, up to this time, forgotten your
headache.
Of the Man with an Eye more hereafter.
OLD COLLEGE LAW AND NEW COLLEGE JUSTICE.

The Dons won’t admit “an excuse for the glass:”
And as they can’t hit on the midnight offender,
They rusticate all of their students en masse.

The Dons of New College still hold a wise saw :
And while sin of the parent’s paid off on the child,
Who can grumble if such is, and was, Oxford law?

'And all England, beholding the act, must acknowledge
That Oxford’s still Oxford, and stands on old ways

IT certainly happens that the Liberals have a numerical
majority of one hundred and ten, or some trifle of that kind,
in the new House, and that, just as matter ºf form, MR;

hardly say that the state of parties is to be estimated in
another way. Of course, nothing more can be done to the
Irish Church; that is beyond doubt. The majority of one
hundred and ten is easily disposed of—thus:–
Irish Liberals who could not think v. v. ling, oil a Pro-
testant Church question . . - - - -
Scotch Liberals, who could not think of interſering
with a question between England and Ireland -
66
Total - - . 116
There, of course, the majority is done away at -
But, if we add that there are 7 Jews, who cannot vote on
a Protestant topic, and 11 Liberal Quakers out of the 12
who cannot have anything to say to a Church at all, and
about 50 Dissenters to whom the same remark must appl
and SIR John SIMEON, who is a Catholic, and thereforew
have too much good taste to vote, we get 69 more, which,

them with only j99, places MR. D'Ixion in the magnificent
majority of Sixty-Nine ! We see no reason why he should
not at once resume office.

Those who totally º that England has ever behaved worse to the
United States than the United States have to England, may neverthe-
less entirely approve of the suggestion thus made at tº
Chamber of Commerce, when the pacific American Minister dined
there the other day, by MR. BRIGHT:-
“Then let us here, if we can, originate or help on a new idea, which is,
that the American people are the same people, and that every man, be he a
Member of Parliament, or a mere private citizen, or Minister of State, and
every writer who endeavours to create jealousy between the two nations, is
an enemy not only to those two nations, but is an enemy to the human race.”
As above, at any rate, ditto to MR. BRIGHT. His proposal, endorsed,
has hereby the advantage of a world-wide circulation. Copy, however,
and approve, likewise, American newspapers.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL DISCOVERY.
IN a report of a paper lately read before the Anthropological Society
by MR. L. Owen PIKE, M.A., on “The Claims of Women to Political
Power,” occurs a passage announcing an indisputable truth:—
“The various fields in which women have won distinction were surveyed;
and the conclusion arrived at was, that however great the capacity of the
female mind may be, it has a natural tendency to occupy itself with those
pursuits that most adorn the mother.”
The study of the fashions, especially, for example. It is true that this
pursuit adorns the daughter no less than the mother, and perhaps gene-
rally rather more of the two; yet, as the daughter is adorned by it with
a view to matrimony, in adorning her it adorns, in intention at any
rate, the future mother: so that the truth of. Miń. PIKE's statement
about the tendency of the female mind is as plain as a pike-staff.
BAD BACKER For THE LATE GoverNMENT.-The Election Returns.
TO THE YOUNG AND HANDSOME.
We do not take unqualified delight, in all the writings of MRs.
FANNY FERN, but she often talks good sense in plain English. For
instance, denouncing the follies of dress, which runs as wild in Broad-
way as in Bond Street, she says:-
“Oh, how I wish that a bevy of young, handsome girls, of good social
| position, would inaugurate a plain lady-like costume for street and church
wear. - I say young and handsome, because if an old woman does this, the
| little chits toss their heads and say, ‘Oh, she has had her day, and don't care
now—and we want ours.’”
A very good suggestion. If a bevy of young and handsome English
girls would like to act upon it, and iſ send us their photographs,
and an intimation of º our office shall be at their service,
and Punch will be happy to preside. Cigarettes, and maraschino–tea

PERAMBULATOR RACEs.
ELocIPEDEs are all, the go at Paris, and,
unless some check be put to the proclivities
of nursemaids, we may expect, ere long, in
London, to see races with perambulators.
We shall not be surprised to hear that MARY
JANE has backed herself to wheel two babies
round Hyde Parkin five-and-twenty minutes,
and doubtless matches will be made in most
adjacent nurseries, , and winners, will be
handicapped by having heavy babies added
to their ſoad. Indeed we doubt not that ere
long perambulator races will be noticed in
Bell’s Life, and we shall read that SUREY
Scroggins, alias “the Flying Spider,” is
open to a race with SALLY Skeggs, the
Brompton Pet. Or the sporting world will
learn, with mingled wonder and delight,
that MRs. LEAVEchild’s “Novice,” on Mon-
day afternoon, raced her perambulator along-
side of a hansom, for upwards of a mile
upon the Hampstead Road.
As nursemaids now, when told to take
the children for an airing, desire invariably
to stop and stare at iſ the bonnet-shops,
it becomes of course their object to go at a
ood pace over the pavement intervening,
- - that they . have fair time for their flir.
tation in the park. By having periodically races with perambulators,
they will learn to keep in training, and acquire both speed in progress
and skill in steering quickly through the crowded streets. The chief
business with our nursemaids, being mostly their own pleasure, their
object naturally is, when ordered out for exercise, to get to their
flirtation-grounds as quickly as they can, after wasting a good time in
the allurements of the shops., ...They pay little heed of course to
what accidents may happen, while they recklessly are urging on their
wild career. Caring little for the little ones entrusted to their charge,
they trust to their good luck to prevent bones being broken, a d keep
eyer at their tongue's § a whole volume of excuses, to account for
it
the upsettings their stupidity and carelessness are certain to induce.

A PAPER FOR THE GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.
MR. Punch,
I KNow I am stupendously ignorant, as I have more than
once confessed penitentially in your ear, but is it absolutely, indis-
pensable to be versed in the geography of Central Asia? I read in an
evening Gazette, the very one which drove me to confide my uneasiness
on the same subject to you before, the following:-
“So preternatural a blunder in the veriest elements of Central Asiatic
geography as the confusion of Little Thibet or Baltistan with the newly
consolidated Turkish realm of the Kushbegi of Yarkand can hardly be the
result of anything but mere oversight.”
In my case I felt it would have been the result of mere ignorance, as
I could not remember ever to have heard of the Kushbegi or his do-
minions before, and the only way in which I could comfort myself was
by reflecting that the paragraph did not refer to the usual ignoramuses
like myself, but to a correspondent's letter in another paper. My com-
placency, however, such as it was, was soon disturbed, for not many
nights had passed when the same journal plunged into Central Asia
again, saying:-
“We cannot º tell whether the two events—that is to say, the defeat
of a force of the Kushbegi in a collision with a Russian force on the Narym,
and lºud of the Russians for a post at Gumah—be well authenticated
or not, &c.”
The easy familiarity with, which all this was treated, as though the
journalist were writing of the defeat of MR. DISRAELI, or the widening
of the Cam, or the EMPEROR of THE FRENCH, convinced me of the
disgrace it was not to be as thoroughly acquainted with the Kushbegi
and the Narym (assumed to be a river, but which may be a cape or a
promontory) as I am with the movements of the PRINCE of WALEs
and the course of the Thames, and I deplored more than ever the
unfinished state in which my education had been left.
During the elections it was sufficiently embarrassing to be asked at
dinner where Eye or Cricklade was, and to be expected to know the
exact position on the map of Linlithgowshire, and the names of the
places forming the Wick District; but if the conversation is going to
turn on Yarkand and its ruler, on Gumah, and Ilchi, and the Chang-
chenmoo route–and we know thatJºº. will talk newspaper, and
this particular journal is a good deal in society—I must procure the
latest Gazetteer, and refuse all invitations, until I am as well up in the
towns and rivers of Central Asia as I am in the Stations of the Metro-
politan Railway. IGNORAMUs.

and among other articles, there were eccrulus indicus, grains of Paradise, an
copperas, the latter being nothing less than green vitriol. He would leave
it to those who understood these things better than himself, to calculate how
much harm such things as these must do to the physical strength and health
of the labourers. As employers of labour it was a serious question for them to
cousider, for it not only depreciated the value of their labourer, but it also
depreciated his whole capital—his health and strength. It was commonly
said that the great curse to the country was the beerhouses, but he believed a
much greater curse was the stuff that was sold in them.”

FRENCII MEDITATIONS.
SIR HENRY, Bulwer (Punch is very glad to see Tamworth had the
sense to elect him) has made a tremendous sensation by his revelation
of a diplomatic secret. In 1840 he says that the French Government
was so º with us, that, “it was considering whether England
should not be attacked without º her any warning.” This
amiable meditation has been denied by M. THIERs.; at least, he says it
was not in hand at the time Lord Howpen, who had asked him about
it, mentioned. But, with all respect for M. THIERs, we incline to
think that SIR HENRY Bulwer was sufficiently well served to ensure
first-class information as to the plans of his enemies; and, though it is
highly proper and decorous for M., THIERs to deny the statement
diplomatically, we should not from the whole case exactly deduce the
moral that England ought to disarm, in confidence that no friend will
ever play her a trick. As SHAKSPEARE remarks—
“Nought shall make us rue
While England keeps a stick, and pistol too.”
Colonial Rule. -
IN a leader relative to New Zealand the Times judiciously remarks:—
“The scale must be revised according to which it would appear that one
Maori's life is computed to be worth the lives of ten Englishmen.”
Yes ruly, it should be revised; and had it not better also be re-
Versed :
Parliamentary Nightwork.
WHEN women have got the franchise, one use which they will make
of it may be expected to be the exaction from candidates of a pledge to
keep earlier legislative hours. They cannot but sympathise with the
wives of Honourable Members who very often do not come from the
national public house till half-past two or three in the morning.

THE Millennium may appear to many of the sincerest wishers for its advent to have been
postponed by the decision of the St. Petersburg Conference to forbear from the use of rifle-
shells in warfare. It may, with great reason, be argued that the more frightful and mur-
derous warlike weapons are made, the more destructive the means of destruction, the sooner
will war, become so terrible that nations will shrink from incurring its horrors. There is
a good deal to be said why the Peace Society, instead of meeting, talking, and agitating for
the direct accomplishment of their object, should devote themselves to the encou ment,
by adequate prizes provided by subscription, of inventions such as Armstrong and Whit-
worth guns, Moncrieff's battery, Palliser's chilled shot, and all manner of torpedoes and
naval or military infernal machines. Suppose, for instance, a joint-stock company (limited)

and enclosing it in swan-shot, with which bombs being filled might scatter certain death,
j, whom they so much as i. It might very plausibly, if not justly, be
maintained that the Peace Society would do one of the best things it could towards galning
its end by promoting such an enterprise.
On the other side there is no denying that the idea of disusing a projectile because it
hurts dreadfully, is perhaps a step to the disuse of all projectiles used in war, and therefore
to the abolition of war. All projectiles hurt dreadfully when they smash bones or inflict
lacerated wounds. The wonders worked by the Chassepot rifle at Mentana hurt those on
whose limbs they were performed, very dreadfully indeed. The St. Petersburg Conference
has decided that the pain given by shells under one pound's weight is, something too
horrid for humanity to permit. If sovereigns and peoples think a little further in this way,
they will possibly get in time to apprehend that the effects of a jagged lump of iron, or even
a smooth one, impinging on the shins with a certain velocity, or tearing up any sentient
region of the human frame, are not so much less horrid as to be allowable. Is it altogether
absurd to suppose that the time may come when
civilised mankind will think of smashing one

SENSATION FOOD.
ood MR. PUNCH,
YoU recollect who
said that he “once
tasted a pea,” when you
told him if that was all
he was a fool; and
GEORGE THE Fourth
agreed with you. I might
so far imitate the hon-
ourable. BRUMMELL in
affectation, as to say,
that I once tasted a
snail: but the fact is, I
have eaten two snails.
I bought them at the
capital charcutier's shop
in Princes Street, Soho,
out of a lot in a bowl,
of course, set in the
window for the foreigners
of Leicester Square;
cost me, as MR. PEPys
says, a penny each. I
ave the honour of re-
porting to you that they
find that you are eating a gasteropod. The cavity can be
stuffed with seasoning, like the inside of a morel; was so
in my two instances: the whole—I mean no pun—
flavoured with garlic. Your snail, thus †. iled
first, as mine had been, and then warmed through in the
oven, is truly a savoury morsel, a tit-bit, a bonne bouche, as
they say. What does it look like? A large, fat, periwinkle.
As that ºl. mollusc is extracted, you hook"it from its
shell, and it comes plump out, about as big as your little
finger, a buttery W. plug of sapid substance. It is, as
the vestryman pronounced the workhouse-soup, decidedly
“succulent; ” but not at all so in the sense suggested by
the living creature.
Do I fancy myself a rook, a blackbird, a thrush, a captive
curlew, or sea-gull kept in a garden, a tame duck? Have
I dreamt I was a low style of owl, or that ignoble member
of the Falconidae, a buzzard: No, Sir, not although I
have eaten snails. Nightmares may come of eating horse,
but snails do not breed them: have not, anyhow, bred
any such chimeras for your WITELLIUs.

A FRENCH LESSON FOR US LONDONERS.
CERTAINLY in some respects our French friends are ahead of us.
Their Paris is, for instance, a far finer city than our London, and not
only are its streets more grand, but more convenient and cleanly than
those of our Cockaigne. The nuisances we tolerate would not be
suffered there. Mud and dust and van demons in Paris are unknown;
and steam rollers for the roadways of Macadam there abound.
Imagine BARON HAUSMANN installed as our Lord Mayor, and gifted
with authority to beautify the City | What a widening of narrow streets,
and º; out of holes and corners, and pulling down of ugly
buildings, and sending to the right-about of vested rights and interests
would infallibly ensue! Give HAUSMANN full command for a single
year in London, and he would build a dozen boulevards to meet at ||
Charing Cross, and would there erect a Second Louvre worthy to adorn
“ the finest site in Europe; ” Holywell Street would be absorbed by
the Boulevard of the Strand, and Temple Bar be carted off to the
South Kensington Museum.
Moreover, our French friends not merely make good streets, but
take the º to give good names to them. In Paris several new
thoroughfares have recently been christened after men of art and
science and philosophy and state-craft, and poetry and medicine; and
not France alone, but England has helped to furnish names of eminent
distinction to distinguish these new streets. Now, this surely is a
precedent we Londoners might follow at a very little cost. If Lord
MAYoR HAUSMANN were installed here, some of us might grumble at
the price of his improvements; but to christen a few score of streets
would only cost a little paint. Let us scrape away the titles of nine-
tenths of King Streets, and our Queen Streets, and our Princes Streets,
and George Streets, which only serve to puzzle postmen, and drive
strangers to despair, and in their place let us paint up such names as
Shakspeare Street, and Newton Street, and Herschel Street, and
Hogarth Street, and Punch Street, which would be easily distinguished
by their distinguished names. Should English history and biography
fall short of the demand, we might well return the compliment
our foreign friends have paid us, and follow “La Rue Faraday”
i. Bouffon Street, Woltaire Street, Montaigne Street, and the
e. -
In some cases indeed we might improve on our French precedent,
|by adapting in a measure the name to the locality....City, streets, for
| instance, might have names of civic note, such as Dick Whittington
Street, Wat Tyler Street, and so forth. Streets christened after lawyers
might be clustered round the Inns and Courts, where lawyers, mostly
congregate, and Blackstone Street and Sugden Street might lead
thence to Chancery Lane. Near the hospitals such names as Abernethy
Street and Brodie Street, would find a fitting place; while in the
neighbourhood of St. Stephens, names such as Chatham, Street and
Pitt Street would clearly be appropriate, to be followed by Peel Terrace,
and Palmerston Place.
THE PRIWY COUNCILLOR. UNSWORN.
THE Court Circular of Wednesday the 9th instant, contained an
announcement which History will call memorable:–
“MR. John BRIGHT was introduced to her Majesty's presence at the
Council, and made the affirmation prescribed by law on, being appointed a
Member of her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, and kissed hands
on his appointment as President of the Board of Trade.”
It may be noted that this occasion was the first on which admission
into the Privy Council was solemnised by simple affirmation. Let us
hope that her Most Gracious Majesty will find her new Privy Coun-
cillor a true Friend.
- QUOTATION REVISED.
A LIBERAL friend assures us that he feels perfectly comfortable now
as to the safety of the Wessel of State, with “BRIGHT on the prow, and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
THURSDAY, December 10th. The “Leap in the Dark” having been
taken, earit Mr. DISRAELI, and enter M.R. GLADSTONE, with a majority
of about 110 behind him.
To-day the Houses met for the first time since the Dissolution.
It may be convenient to the thousands who read nothing else but
Punch, and are therefore the salt of the earth, to be told in a few words
who are the new Ministers, and what are their functions. Mr. Punch
has desired his little boy to make a Ministerial Alphabet, and the poor
child seems to have earned his orange:–
A is ARGYLL, who will mind the East Indies,
And AYRTON, who looks out of Treasury windies.
B is John BRIGHT, who's to see after Trade,
And BRUCE, who will now the Home Office pervade.
C is Lord CLARENDON, Foreign Affairs,
CARDwell, who’s troubled with War Office cares,
CoLLIER and ColeHIDGE, the A. and S.-G.,
And CHILDERs, who sends out the Ships to the sea.
D is GRANT-DUFF, from the north of this isle,
And he’s to be under the DUKE of ARGYLL.
F’s MR. ForsTER, who'll see to the Schools,
While ForTEscue virtually Ireland rules.
G’s MR. GLADSTONE, the Captain on Deck.
GLYN, same as AYRTON, Joint Treasury Sec.
DE GREY, the Lord President (perhaps you think he
Should have come in before, as beginning with D).
Gösches at Poor flaw an absolute Solon 1S,
And GRANVILLE the courtly’s to manage the Colonies.
H is LoRD HATHERLEY, learned and good,
He s Chancellor now, he was known as PAGE Woon :
And HARTINGTON, Marquis, who writes a good hand,
So will see to the Letters in Martinie Grand.
K, KIMBERLEY, Lord Privy Seal, doth produce,
Besides KNATCHBULL-HUGEssen, Home, under BRUCE.
L, dear Papa, is the Loquent Lowe,
He takes the Exchequer where taxes do grow.
And LAYARD, of Nineveh, partial to Turks,
Succeeds Lord JoHN MANNERs in charge of the Works.
M 's MonsPLL, who under LoRD GRANVILLE has got.
And MR. MoncKIEFF, the Lord Advocate, Scot.
O 's MR. Otway, an excellent man,
Who under Lord CLARENDoN does all he can.
And JUSTICE O'HAGAN, of whom you’ll be glad :
First Catholic Chancellor Erin has had.
S is LoRD SPENCER, of Wimbledon, Sire,
Where you took me to see all the Volunteers fire.
To Dublin he goes for to play the L.L.
(And there's no doubt he’ll do it uncommonly well).
MR, STANSFELD, created a Treasury Third Lord,
And SYDNEY, with elegant Chamberlain Sword.
Those are the Ministers, and some of them have to be elected, and
some to be re-elected. The Houses met this Thursday, and MR. DENI-
son, proposed by SIR GEORGE GREY, and seconded by MR. WALPole,
was unanimously re-chosen Speaker, and he read the Commons a very
proper lecture on the duty of moderation in the use of strength and
respect for the rights of Minorities. He was subsequently approved of
by the QUEEN, who confirmed all the rights of Parliament.
Since then the Members have been swearing.
Prodigy Peabody.
WHAT ought MR. PEABODY to have for his addition of another
£100,000 to his P. gift of £150,000 to the London poor? A
statue, if we had a PHIDIAs to make such a thing; but we haven’t.
One as Fº nearly, as could be made in England, except as to dura-
bility of material, will probably be erected in his honour by MADAME
TUssaud, if there has not been already. For the credit of human
nature, to balance the monsters of crime, MR. PEABODY ought, if he still

Works, LoRD John MANNERs. Let it be said of him that he found
the Regent's Park Lake of mud, and he left it of concrete. He remains,
however, as a legislator, and this is essential to the Constitution: for
what says the maxim Leges sine Moribus.pande–laws are vain unless

OUR OWN FUDGE ADS.
EREMIAH.-Pipe out, and bird's eye winking. She never told her
love. Nature's Nobility. Give an address that will not find you. This
day twelvemonth. Oysters and treacle.
Bºº lady and the fortune are yours for the asking, and
the title may be had when the new Government is settled. But you
must pay the one-and-ninepence. Punch's Private Enquiry Office, box 365.
OB LOT.-These are not proper names. The father softens, but the
Governor is resolved. I fear you will have to be honest and industrious,
but while there is tick there is hope, so keep up your spirits. Also keep your
boxes locked, or the landlord may discover the true value of their precious
contents. Frightened at a skeleton key? No bones about that.
Eº M——The mine is charged, and one word from you will
blow them into ten thousand pieces. Say it, or for ever hereafter hold
your peace. Private Enquiry Office, M.R.
AURISTINUS.—The baby is very ugly, and has been christened
Bonassus. The family are not anxious for your return. Would not a
voyage to Australia do you good? You need not expect any remittances.
Pourquoi non couper votre baton &
RACK.—“Too deep for tears.” . In fact, much too deep, they spoil
the eyes you once said were so fair. Do not mock a broken heart with
opera tickets. If used, only that they may not be lost. May you never know
the united agonies of bereavement and indigestion | Forgive you. Yes, until
my lawyer succeeds in serving the writ.
ERSECUTED BILL.-It is false. I am no lunatic. I have bathed
in the holy light of the Seven Stars. I live on glycerine and onions.
Yah! You set your comet to spy on me, but I nailed his tail to a moon-beam
in the wall. I have eaten your gold fish. To-night at 12, look for a black-
beetle under your pillow, and beneath his left wing find a letter from Julius
Caesar. The creak of my boots has been set to music, and my soul sings to
you. . Why should I be sad, when the Cattle are gone to the Show 2 Mary,
call the cattle home. Yah! Private Lunatic Enquiry Office, but don't direct
letters on the outside, the postmen are spies.
THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE.
WHY can’t the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council stick
to one thing at a time, and finish that off, instead of muddling them-
selves with all sorts of cases, running into one another?
For instance, I am fond of Ecclesiastical squabbles, and therefore I
look with pleasure for the continuation of those Ritualistic Causes
which were only partly heard. -
Well, Sir, say on Monday I, read MARTIN.p. MACHONochie, it
reaches an interesting point, and is to be continued in to-morrow's
ader.
p f take up to-morrow’s paper, and turn to Judicial Committee Privy
Council. Instead of MARTIN v. MACHONochi.E, I find EMILY ANNE
v. AMELIA JANE, which turns out to be not a question of people utterly
at sea about lights, but of people not having lights at sea. After this
is THE BoomERsuND p.ALLEN BAY, a dispute about a collision, unworthy
of the Great Judicial Privy Council . The next day I again turn to
the Judicial Committee and expect MARTIN v. MAchoNochi E or some
such serious ecclesiastical trial, which is more befitting the J. C. P. C.’s
consideration than the horrid swearings and counter-swearings of a lot
of reckless mariners. No, Sir, I read that the Court was occupied in
investigating whether RUMTUM JELLY BAG of º Was
right in appealing against a decision of a Judge in Calcutta who had
directed a verdict in favour of BABoo BRoolecuRT TUBAHOY Bhoy.
A thoroughly heathen case is allowed to put the Christian out of Court.
Collisions are taken the next day, and BARRY LULLABY LALLA, RHoo
has his turn next day. I believe they’ve forgotten all about the im-
portant Ecclesiastical questions awaiting their Lordships' final decision.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
A MAN.
(Clerk to St. Simon's Without.)
SIR,
Anything but the Right Wood for the Work.
To make CHARLEs Wood–Lord HALIFAx, Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland, would be really going beyond the large licence allowed to
Cabinet-makers of putting round pegs into square holes. Er quoris
ligno fit Mercurius, perhaps. But, “Er quoris ligno, non fit prorer,”
—you can't make a Lord-Lieutenant out of any Wood.
will His SECRETARY TELL Us?
At one stage of the elaborate rites and ceremonies which protect the
British Constitution, when a New Parliament, is provided with a
Speaker, he presents himself in a “bob-wig.” The question has been
asked, whether it is so called as only costing a shilling?

“Well, dear fellow,” he replies, having a finniking way with him;
“Well, dear fellow, I don’t think the table is quite straight, eh?”
“Yes,” you say, you think it is, and you give it just the slightest
move to the left or the right.
Whichever it is, BENTON, has the same objections, namely,

MRS. DURDEN ON SCIENCE.
(Inspiration derived from Zadkiel’s Almanack.)
AstroNoMY Geology! and Chemistry | Drat all your science,
On which you han’t a got no doubt, but places sitch entire reliance
Ah, there, now mark my words, I say you’ll all on you one day awaken,
And when you thought how wise you was, you’ll find how much you
was mistaken.
I don't deny but what you may foretell eclipses and the weather,
But as for your vain therios I disregards 'em altogether,
I don’t believe the world a year more older than of old 'twas reckoned,
Nor yet that it goes round the sun, not I, not for a single second.
Your tree of science is a tree which there º good-for-nothin' fruit on.
In Zadkiel's Almanack I’m glad to see there’s a show up of Newton.
And there’s a book wherein a man the courage has the truth to utter;
This earth’s a dixt, for all the world exactly like a pat of butter.

Joe MILLERs,
What if they was but dragons slain by early saints and giant-killers?
And how if somebody, by 'nd by, beyond a doubt succeeds in provin'

Don't talk to me, don't say a word agin what is my firm, conwiction;
Because, if so, I always turns a deaf ear to sitch contradiction.
Your scientific wonders is, in my opinion, the invention -
Of one whose name it is n’t thought polite and proper for to mention.
I thinks when he found out that folks in witches had got unbelievin',
That he put into wizards' heads them other methods of deceivin'.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SWELLS AND THE SHERIFF'S OFFICER.
A BALLAD OF BREAM'S BUILDINGS.
(See the “Times,” Police Report for Wednesday, December 9th.)
A Pleasanter, party ne'er got into Queer Street
Than the gallant ex-Captain Charles Leveson LANE,
Unless 'twas his neighbour next door in that dear street,
The gallant ex-Captain MACARTHUR RALPH PAYNE.
Two more out-and-out bricks ne'er scored honours and tricks,
Or floated more paper at forty per cent.:
Kept opener houses, ran º larger ticks,
r in riding or rowing the pace faster went.
But spending, worse luck, can’t go on without earning,
And the wind's hard to raise when the pace is so fast:
And, as 'tis a long Lane that hasn't a turning,
CAPTAIN LANE was brought up with a round turn at last.
CAPTAIN PAYNE, who ne’er craned before “bullfinch” or “double,”
But took them as straight as his horse he could ram, -
Came a cropper like LANE, but like LANE, when in trouble,
his Moët, and cried, “What true Pain but stands Shan . "
Two Captains like these ’twas an honour to SLoMAN,
To receive at his snug box in Chancery Lane:
Where if swells can and will pay, 'tis certain that no man
Can say SLOMAN's shabby, or stints his Champagne. |
For your snob, when he’s “tapped,” into Whitecross Street passes.
But SLQMAN’s Hotel your swell debtor receives;
If its windows are barred,—’tis to guard their plate-glasses,
If its yard’s grated o'er, 'tis to keep out the thieves.
So SlomaN's Hotel LANE and PAYNE took their ease in,
For a º: room stood their two guineas a day;
Their habits were sociable, chatty, and pleasing
They ate, smoked, and drank, and ne'er asked what's to pay. t
They had in MR. S.LoMAN's young man, JextMy Luckrºtt,
In the affablest way for a glass and a song,
Made him sit down to supper, and in bade him tuck it,
And life in the lock-up sped gaily along.' ' Tº yº
•
Brim-full of the Swell's wine and friendly attentions,
UCKETT bowed himself out in the state known as “tight;”
Used to bolt in the day, he felt no apprehensions,
Such out-and-out nobs would e'er bolt in the night.
The next morning came, with the milk and the muffins,
And LUCKETT looked scared, when the window he found,
Bars, wrenched from their sockets, for all they were tough 'uns,
While those swells through the opening had dropped to the ground!
They were gone, he was done, done were Bower and SLoMAN,
That brace of caged captains were loose on the wing;
Free as sea, or as air, which ne'er pay what they owe man,
On the pier at Boulogne they were taking their swing.
Oh, wild was the outcry of SLOMAN, the sold one !
Not that out of apartments, and dinners, and wines,
They had done him, who deemed him a match for the old one,
But that worse might be still in the wind he divines!
For SLOMAN, so long as he holds debtors’ bodies,
For their care must to creditors answer at law;
And if they escape, English justice so odd is,
Their creditors’ claims out of SLOMAN to gnaw
He has steamed to Boulogne by the morning's mail packet;
He has found LANE and PAYNE at its snuggest hotel;
Made appeal to their feelings, and offered to back it,
With a handsome douceur to each hard-hearted swell.
One hundred' two hundred!! three hundred!!! four !!!! five, Sir!!!!!
So ran up the bidding, but coolly quoth PAYNE,-
“We’ve got you in Chancery now, Ali alive, Sir,
More safe than you had us in Chancery Lane!”
“Only think of our creditors,” added the Captain,
“What chance of a copper, poor devils, have they,
If we were again your hotel safely clapt in,
To pass through the Court, and go whitewashed away?
“Whereas you are good, you delightful old SLoMAN,
For twice the five thousand for which we were “in :'
And as you’ve let us slip your fingers, you know man,
The creditors must look to you for the tin.
| williºn
“They’ll own that our conduct is full of good .
Shows we’ve come to a sense of our duty, though late;
P'raps—I’d not be surprised—with a little appealing,
If they vote us a teapot or service of plate.
“In debt, as in love and in war, all is fair,
And yourself you’ve to thank if you’ve giv'n us the pull,
And found us the means, which we don’t mean to spare,
Of our numerous creditors paying in full.”
So they chaffed and they laughed, and they fleered him and jeered him,
While sorely-sold Slow AN, with agony wild,
Prayed they’d think how he’d dined ’em, champagned’em, and beered
em,
Prayed they'd pity himself and his wife and his child.
In vain through Boulogne with entreaties he followed 'em ;
The more he besought them, they chaffed him the more,
Till the matelo!!es and gamins derisively holloaed him
From the quay to the station, the pier to the shore.
At length outspoke LANE, with a mock’ry of pity, ,
“E'en the woes of a Slow AN o'er right shall prevail:
I’ll return and surrender myself in the City, -
If you’ll pay me a hundred down, here, on the nail."
Oh, a glad man was SIoMAN, as, out of his pocket,
He thrust two crisp fifties in flane's ready palm—
Ah, little he knew that already LANE's docket
Was struck in the Court that is bankruptcy's balm"
But PAYNE, more obdurate, a new and last proffer
Of five hundred down still refused with disdain,
So, thankful one Captain had closed with his offer,
Sad Sloman took steam back to Chancery Lane.
To the carcase full soon the grim vultures were gathered—
The creditors came upon SLoy(AN en masse—
And LANE's debts upon him, with PAYNE's he found fathered,
While LANE through the Court was preparing to pass!
SLoMAN's crib had been cracked ere LANE took to “the Act,”
So his debts lay, like PAYNE's, at the officer's charge;
And the creditors sung, as they welcomed the fact,
“One SLOMAN in hand's worth two fast men at large.”

THE PEABODY FUND.
DEAR SIR,-Look here, Peabody again. Upon my word, one
hundred thousand pounds given to the general poor of London. I
don't say one word against MR.P. for this: no it’s his own and he has
a right to do what he likes with it. But why fritter all this away among
the poor when a fiftieth part per annum would have done some genuine
and real good to Yours ever,
G. RUMBLER.
SIR,-All very well these Munificent Gifts. But if it goes on, where
will the Poor be? Why as rich as a Rothschild without the trouble
of having worked for it. The Poor, in fact, will be the Rich man’s
Heirs. Yours,
Won't Doo.
SiR,-Suppose the PEABODY Money be thus applied:—
1. In disposing of hardened professional thieves and sending them
to people the interior of Africa.
2. In providing for the children of the above at home, educating
and making them industrious, honest members of society.
3. If Interior of Africa won't do, get some other place. Part of
the money might be used for this purpose. Buy. Spain. Buy
Tartary, and call it Crim Tartary, short for criminal.
At your service,
BUz.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IT 'S ALL VERY WELL
To ENJoy RUDE HEALTH AND To Look For ALL THE World LIKE A Substantial Country SQUIRE, BUT THE conseqt ENCE is, THAT
DURING THE CATTLE Show WEEK THE ATTENTions of the London Populace ARE MoRE EMBARRAssing Than PleasANT :
PUNCH IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH.
MR. Punch extracts from the Standard the following report of what
took place in the Court of Queen's Bench, one day last week, in the
course of a case which will now become immortal, MoRRIs v.RALLING.
The plaintiff, a doctor, complained of having been caricatured.
every week in Punch.
“The Lord Chief Justice.—But ‘PUNCH' is privileged.
“MR. SERJEANT PARRY.-I should be sorry to say anything to the contrary.
“The Lord ChIEF Justice.—We have all appeared there more or less.
“MR. SERIEANT PARRY.-I am sure your Lordship never appeared there
except in a complimentary manner.
“The Lord CHIEF Justice.—I once saw myself there; and if I believed I
could have appeared in so ruffianly a form I should have been very much
ashamed of myself.”
For the earlier remarks of the Lord Chief Justice of England, Mr.
Punch simply tenders his thanks. The declaration from the Bench is
useful as a notice to any foolish persons who do not comprehend that
Punch can do no wrong. The sharpest attorney will hardly venture a
letter after SIR ALEXANDER Cockburn's dictum, not that Mr. Punch
ever cared for attorneys’ letters. Further, he offers to MR, SERJEANT
PARRY his acknowledgments for the admirable way in which he con-
veyed Mr. Punch's own sentiments in reference to the Chief Justice.
But in reply to his Lordship's last remark Mr. Punch has a word to say:
SIR ALEXANDER was upon one occasion depicted by a hand that dwelt
more upon the situation to be illustrated than upon the praisemblance of
the portraiture—let that pass, and let it be noted that on a later occa-
sion, when the Chief Justice was again delineated, his º Was
represented in all the dignity of his high office, manifesting a noble and
judicial disgust at the appearance of a Briber and Corrupter. There
full justice was done to one whom Mr. Punch delights to honour, and
of whom he hath ever spoken in a befitting way. He has, however, a
complaint to make against SIR ALEXANDER for involuntarily cutting
him out of a capital picture and quotation, which would certainly have
“MR. SERJEANT PARRY said it was nothing more than what appeared p
followed the above remark of the Chief Justice, if he had only happened
to be an individual of Vanity. . In that case it would have been Mr.
Punch's obvious duty to depict himself conducting the judge to a
mirror, and saying, from Henry the Fourth,
“My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that Wain Man.” -
But as SIR. A. Cockburn has more right to be vain than ninety-nine
eqple out of a hundred, and yet does not exercise that right, Mr. Punch
is debarred from this exercise of his wit, and he is glad of it. Finally,
and in all the seriousness, which is becoming when a Christmas wish
is uttered, he wishes SIR ALEXANDER all the good wishes of the coming
season.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 267
THEATRICAL REFORMERS.
All . . . . . . . . . , OLD playgoers
| may complain
!, of the decline
of the drama,
and, say that
nothing on
the stage is
ever nowadays
worth seeing;
\\ but consider-
ing that all the
old theatres
are flourishing,
\ and that a
, brace of new
& ones have been
lately built and
opened, it
| | ls
º, .. that people
fºll differ from old playgoers. The more playhouses the merrier,
et us hope will be the case; and may the Globe and Gaiety succeed for
many a season in P. contributing to the gaiety of the globe.
That success is well deserved in the instance of the Gaiety should be
allowed by all who read this comment in the Times:—
“One reform deserves special notice, and it is that all fees, donations, or
gratuities to attendants are under any and every pretence prohibited. There
is to be no fee for booking, no charge for bills, no charge for taking care of
coats, cloaks, or hats. e one payment at the door clears everything. This
is a radical º: and one which will soon force other theatres where
the attendants live by open mendicancy, and where a programme is often not
to be had at a less price than a shilling, to follow an example which should
have been set long before.” º
Theatres, like Tories, are slow at all reforms: and a century or so
hence, when, all the playhouses in London will have followed this
example of abolishing all fees for cloak-rooms, bills, and box-keepers,
the critics of the period may dispute as to the theatre where this
reform was started first. If they will turn then to their Punch, they
will find it here recorded that it was not at the Gaiety, but at the New
Adelphi, where fees for bills and º were primarily abolished;
and for being the §ſ."; manager to follow the º of MR.
BENAMIN WEESTER, MR. HoLLINGsHEAD of the Gaiety will share with
him the honour of living for posterity in the immortal page of Punch.
PUNCH's Essence of PARLIAMENT.
DECEMBER 14: Monday. Ninety-three oaths were taken, making
above five hundred which Members had fired off as a salute to the
QUEEN. Then MR. GEORGE GLYN swore he would have no more of it,
and cleared the House.
Tuesday. The Lords met, and sent for the Commons. Then did
LQRD HATHERLEy, the new Lord Chancellor, olin SIR PAGE Wood,
deliver a neat little Message from the QUEEN without spilling any of
it. He informed his hearers that divers vacancies had occurred in the
House of Commons, by reason that divers Members, had accepted
offices. It was HER MAJESTY's pleasure that an opportunity be given
for º these vacancies, and that, after a Suitable Recess, Parlia:
ment, should proceed to the consideration of such matters as would
then be laid before it.
Then did the Commons walk off, and the CHANCELLOR went out and
made a magnificent toilette, and re-appeared in all the glory of full
robes. He then knelt down before the Royal Chair, but to show that
would seem M
he was not. afraid of that handsome piece of furniture, he rose, and
then kneeling down again, gave it a playful poke with his patent of
peerage. Next he got up and went to the table, but did not kneel to
that, or even poke it, but only swore. Then he went to a back bench
and sat down humbly as a mºre Baron, but he promptly got up and
took his seat haughtily on the Dukes' row, to show his right, as
Chancellor, to precedence. Sticking to neither of these seats, he then
went and got upon the woolsack, which we hope he found pretty
comfortable. This pleasing pantomime being over,
EARL GRANVILLE came out in a very little farce. He told every-
body a grand piece of news, namely that MR. DISRAELI's administration
n succeeded by that of GLApsToNE, and his Lordship
hoped that their lordships, would not think it unreasonable if his
Lordship moved their Lordships' adjournment until Thursday the
11th February, 1869. Apparently their Lordships did not think it un-
reasonable at all, at any rate nobody objected, and they all went away.
On the whole Mr. Punch is inclined to be glad that the Intelligent
Foreigner was not present at these performances.
The Commons, three hundred strong, returned to their own House,
and the SPEAKER reported what had taken place during their presence
in the other. This was a delicate but not precisely a necessary atten-
tion, as they had all heard the message. Then there was more swearing—
about fifty oaths were taken.
MR. AYRTON, for the first time in office, made a speech about Election
Petitions, and a great number of gentlemen **. shuddered. He
reminded the House that the Judges of the Common Pleas were thence-
forth to judge election grievances. In the absence of MR. GLADSTONE
and his other chiefs, it would be inconvenient to discuss anything, and
he should move for new writs only in cases where the time for petition-
ing had expired. Then they would adjourn until the 29th, and on that
day the other writs would be moved. But where a petition had been
presented, but the seat was not claimed (you’ll see what this meant,
directly) the course was to let the writ issue. - -
Then, amid enormous cheering, he moved the Greenwich writ, for
MR. GLADstoxE.
He moved Oxford, London University, Pontefract, and when he
came to Birmingham, there were loud cheers, on both sides of the
House, at mention of the Right Honourable John BRIGHT.
He moved London. But there is a petition against the three Liberal
embers, and MR. Gosch EN, President of the Poor Law Board, is one
of them. Some discussion took place, but SIR. Round ELL PALMER
[Punch hopes that you understand, foreigners especially, that this
gentleman might have been Lord Chancellor, iſ he had only chosen to
resign his conviction that the Irish Church ought not to be destroyed.
How many people with so splendid a prize dangling within reach would
not have modestly felt that their conviction must have been wrong,
since so many good and clever men held a different one—and taken the
office and coronet?] -* .
said—the House on both sides had the grace to cheer him vehemently—
that it was clear that the writ ought to issue. It did, and MR. GoschEN
was re-elected on Monday last. -
Writs for MR. LAYARD, MR. CHILDERs, MR. STANSFELD, and others
—thirteen in all—were issued, as was one for Wareham, where death
made a vacancy. _º
A great many Notices of Motion were given, some most desirable
some utterly absurd. But sufficient for the day is the debate thereof.
When the motions are made, Punch will know how to deal with them.
The House rose until the 29th, and it will be ºl. jolly for
forty gentlemen to have to be in town on that day, instead of being
out of it with their amiable wives and lovely families; or, in the case of
bachelors, flirting in country houses. But we dare say that a Residuum
will be found to listen to Mr. GLYN's Whip. The CHANCELLQR 9F
THE Exchequer ought to give these patriots a jovial dinner in the
Tea Room at the national expense, by way of commencing his pro-
mised reduction of expenditure. We’ll come, if we’re asked, as we
shall be bored with º: by that time—or earlier.
Mr. Punch wishes .." a Merry Christmas—not that this has any-
thing particular to do with Parliament—but he appears just forty-
eight hours before the Festival, and likes to be polite. However,
you needn’t accept_the compliment unless you like. He’s sure he
doesn’t care.
A.
“De Amicitia.”
SPEAKING of the EMPEROR of the FRENch, the Paris Correspondent
of the Pall Mall Gazette says,
“ His Majesty was visited the other day by an old and bluff-spoken friend,
M. LAITY. He was about to consult that gentleman on public opinion when
the EMPREss intervened,” &c.
Remembering the influence under which the EMPRESs is supposed to
act, the obvious comment on the above is, that the EMPEROR's friend
ls LAiry, the EMPREss's—Clergy.
A Great Compliment.
“It is said that the decree which fixes 75 years as the limit, on attaining
which the First President of the Court of Cassation is obliged to retire from
the Bench, is about to be revised for the sake of M. Troplong, who has long
held that office. M. Troplong, though 75, is still with his faculties unim-
paired, and, moreover, he is too useful to be dispensed with. In any case, his
retirement from the Court of Cassation would not necessarily require him to
give up the Presidency of the Senate.”—Paris Correspondent of the Times.
PUNCH congratulates the venerable President, for it is evident that
long as he has served, he is not thought to have served too long.
THE EASTERN BORE.
It is said that, “when Greek meets Greek then comes the tug of
war.” Never mind that; but, for the peace of Europe, let us hope
that, when Greek meets Turk the case will prove otherwise.

MRS. PUNCH'S LETTERS TO HER, DAUGHTER.
MY CHILD, . .
At this time of the year, when fond Fº are preparing
holiday amusements for the Children, of the Period, it behoves a
British matron and patriotic mother like myself to say something
about both. -
Are there indeed any children of the period?
Fashionable young ladies and young gentlemen there are of all ages,
from four years upward; but the Children—where are the children
gone to ? I see very few in the West End streets decked so gaily for
Christmas; I see very few among the Christmas Trees at Covent
Garden Market; I see very few in the places of amusement especially
opened for the young; plenty of richly-dressed, supercilious little men
and women; but are these children?
Picture, to yourself the holiday life of a little lady of six or seven
years. She is supplied with an expensive toilette, consisting of
morning-dress, afternoon-dress, ball-dress, fans, flowers, and feathers;
she issues and accepts invitations for evening parties; she drinks tea,
cats ices, dances, coquettes and sups in hot rooms hours after all little
people should be in bed; she goes to theatres, concerts, and private
theatricals; she is taught to discriminate between those who are of
“her set,” and those who are not. She looks down with contempt
upon child's play and childish children, and grows up the veriest little
snob in the world.
Where will all this, end? Shall we soon have children going into
Committee on the rights of minors, children sending up pºſion. for
Nursery Reform, children's newspapers, children's clubs, C. P
* where will the extravagance end which is being imitated by all
ranks :
A lady lately writing in a popular . magazine, made the
somewhat inconsiderate statement that no gentleman could dress upon
a sum under £100 a year. How much would she allow for the dress
of a young º six years? How much for the dress of the said
young lady's dolls :
Really, these calculations are enough to afflict any married man of
moderate means with all sorts of terrifying visions, and to make him
wonder where these costly vanities of the drawing-room, the school-
room, and the nursery will end. If the Children of the Period cause
him to tear his hair at the influx of Christmas bills now, what will he
do when they have grown up into young ladies and gentlemen?
I must confess to you, my dear daughter, a nervous dread of the
Children of the Period. Supposing that Mr. Punch and I were to deck
a Christmas-tree for them, would they enjoy it, would they care for our
sixpenny toys, would they play Blind-Man's Buff, and be content to go
home at eight o'clock, after partaking of your mother's home-made
cakes and goodies? fear not. I fear they would criticise us, and
think us shabby, and declare they would never enter such a dull house
again.
... But how to pass the Christmas-tide without children? That is quite
impossible to children-loving old souls like your papa or myself, so let
us gather the dear little people about us, the rich as well as the poor,
make merry with them, after our own way. ..I cannot but believe that
this fashion of young ladies “coming out” at the early age of five
years, will soon be put down, with other monstrosities, such as children's
“Revivals,” and that the toilettes, r creations, and sociabilities of
the nursery, will soon cease to parody those of the drawing-room.
once heard two little French children talking to each other at a juvenile
party, and this is was what they said, “Do you know those little girls
yonder f" asked one. “Oh, no!” answered the other, with a shrug
of the shºulders, “ (Ils ne sont pas de notre monde)—they are not of
our set !”
Do we want this sort of worldly wisdom in our children? Do we
want them to be little satirists and little snobs? I say, no! and that is
why I want to see the children's Christmas kept in a simple fashion.
Bless them all. Your affectionate Mother,
MRs. PUNCH.

THE POLITICAL EXCHANGE.
THE late elections showed us how candidates for the honour of
adding M.P. to their names appear in .# many cases sadly puzzled
what to call themselves. If they be True Blue, Church-and-State, and
No-Surrender Tories, or if they be Root-and-Branch, and Out-and-
Out Reforming Radicals, they are thereby saved much pains in framing
their election addresses. But the moderate men seem frightened lest
they be mistaken for either of these classes, and are terribly afraid of
offending their constituents either by avowing too little or too much.
With the moderate Conservative the perplexity is greater than it is
with the moderate reformer, and he is far more puzzled to determine
what principles to acknowledge, and what promises to make.
What a º it would be, then, at any future election, for a
Candidate thus puzzled, if some one were to start a Political
Exchange, wº old principles and seats might be exchanged for
new ones, and political aspirants be relieved from the expense of a con-
tested election, and 1rom the cost to their conscience of fabling glib
excuses for pledges unfulfilled, and of flourishing fine promises
whereof the right of violation is inwardly reserved? The following
º will suffice to show the reader how the project might be
Worked :-
I have a seat for a close borough, which has for several ages belonged

pledges, and freed from the absurd and bigoted high Tory traditions of
my family. I should be glad to hear where I can have a good, sharp,
savage, radical contest in exchange. SIMON PURE.
I inherit a large stock of old Tory principles and prejudices, which,
as I am anxious to enter the Reform Club, I am willing to exchange
for some advanced ideas. WIRTUous WILLIAM.
Will anybody give me a few classical quotations, commending free
trade and liberal institutions, in exchange for some in praise of a pro-
tective policy, for which I am obliged to say I have no further use ?
RATTING Richard.
I have the offer of a nomination for a Radical constituency, but as I
hitherto have always called myself a Tory, I am afraid some rotten eggs
will be thrown at me on the hustings. Will some kind person give me
a snug borough in exchange? CAvenDo TUTUs.
|EI have a common-place book nearly filled with clap-trap sentimen
ts
well suited to be used in a Conservative canvass, and to be spouted
after dinner to the addle-pated farmers at an agricultural meeting. I
am desirous to exchange it for a volume of more liberal opinions, con-
taining some statistics on the progress of free trade. AN AsPIRING
REFoRMER.
As I have no fortune, to speak of, and am gifted with but little in-
dustry or intellect, and can therefore see no other chance of earning a
good living, I am willing to exchange very precious liberty for the con-
finement of a close attention to the business of the House. Any
borough that is willing to pay me for my public services will confer a
private favour by electing me its Member. CHEEKY CHARLEY.

I am plagued with poor relations, who, because I happen to have a
seat in Parliament, are always pestering me to help them to a snug
place under Government. If any one can aid me to get rid of those
annoyances, I shall be delighted to exchange addresses with him. A
LovER of A QUIET LIFE.
I have been solicited to let myself be nominated for a rotten borough.
The cost of my election, it is thought, will not exceed, much, £11,000.
As I vastly prefer yachting to sitting in a stuffy house, and hearing
stupid speeches, I will exhange my nomination for the loan of a good

I have some old-fashioned notions about honesty and honour, and
the great value of virtue in a public man. As I hope to make my seat

his disposal a close borough in a capital hunting country. Not feeling
myself quite equal to undergo the labour of sitting upon committees,

So when she had made it, she took it
To FATHER IGNATIUs, to book it
Said she, “He’s a Saint—don't he look it?”
Dear FATHER IGNatius the Deacon.
Oh Good Gracious !
FATHER IGNATIUs,
Even young women are mendacious.
For after this girl had made a vow,
To do or to don’t, I can’t tell now
What was its object, or how she spoke it;
Whatever it was, it’s certain she broke it.
Then FATHER IGNATIUS rose up in a rage,
And paced about like a man on a stage;
He called for his book,
And he called for his candle,
He called for his bell,
Which he held by the handle;
When, just as the Acolyte lighted the taper,
Cries IGNATIUS, “Stop! bring to me pen, ink, and paper.”
With extracts, in Latin, made from a Missal,
IGNATIUS indited a sacred epistle.
The sum of the translation
Was “EXCOMMUNICATION | *
What did she do? this girl of a vow P
Did she at once to the sentence bow P
Or grovel in ashes?
Or answer with dashes 2
Or hang herself in a couple of sashes?
No : she did nothing at all of this sort:
She simply behaved as a good child ought.
She went to Mamma and showed her the letter,
Says Ma, “I should just like to see him 11 he’d better //"
“It’s like his impudence,” says she,
“He’s not heard the first nor the last of me.
She called for her bonnet,
She called for her shawl,
She called for her servant
A cab to call,
And away they went to Fulham to see
The Bishop of London, TAIT, A.C.
ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL TAIt is he
Who’s just appointed to Canterburie;
“I’ve half a mind,” said he, with a frown,
“To take away BROTHER IGNATIUs’ gown;
If MR. LYNE
Were a Deacon of mine,
I’d very soon take him a peg or two down.
His teaching’s not bad,
But his practice is awful,
This Excommu— 'tis quite unlawful.”
So he writes to the Rector, MR. HILL,
Whose church IGNATIUs used to fill,
To say the days of IGNATIUs are numbered,
“I won’t have him preach in the street of the Lombard.
* The story of how FATHER IGNATIUs excommunicated a young lady,
who appealed to her mother, who †. to the Bishop of LoNDoN, has
appeared in several papers within the last fortnight.
“The world is spacious,
BROTHER IGNATIts
Can go and preach just where he may please;
But he doesn’t come here,
That is, my dear
MR. HILL, while I’m master in this diocese.”
Postscript ad Linum.
MISTER LYNE, you’re a Christian, be a meek’un,
Behave as becomes a man and a Deacon.
You’re only a Deacon, think of that,
ith just as much right
That note to indite
To that young lady, as my old hat.
Come, no more scandals,
Drop your sandals,
Your flowers and candles,
And be to our flocks a flaming Beacon,
As PARSON LYNE,
You yet may shine,
If you drop this FATHER IGNATIUs the Deacon.
A LITTLE WORD FROM A LITTLE BIRD.
PLEASE, Mr. Punch, why should a canary not be treated as kindly as
a cat? . This is not a riddle, but a question which was asked the other
day at Bow Street, where the Magistrate was requested to state if he
could punish, a brute who “tamed” canaries by breaking both their
wings, and then showed the little crippled creatures in the streets,
where people paid their pennies to see how tame they were, and how
fond they seemed, because they did not fly away from him. should
have thought that cruelty like this was legally forbidden; but, alas! I
find that—
“MR. WAUGHAN, after consulting the statutes, said that a bird was not an
animal within the meaning of the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
even if the specific act of cruelty alleged in this case could be proved.”
I often hear young ladies sing, “Oh, would I were a bird!” but,
until the law be altered, they are surely very silly for expressing such
a wish. How would they like the cruel torture of having their poor
wings broken, so that they might seem tame, and then the further tor-
ture of gaining a good living for the wretch who had thus º: them.
and whose cruelty the law as yet is powerless to prevent! now that
it is often rather i. to ascertain the “meaning ” of an Act of Parlia-
ment, and, of course, I am aware that “a bird is not an animal.” But
I can't see why the law should not prevent a man from being cruel to
canaries, as well as dogs and cats; and I hope SIR RICHARD MAYNE
will get it altered for the sake of his small namesake,
Poor DICKY.
A BREAK-DOWN IN COURT.
THE wisdom, humanity, and utility of keeping jurors confined all
night long, pending their detention on a trial for felony, has been beau-
tifully illustrated again. At the Central Criminal Court, the other
day, {e}. MR. BARON CLEASBY, a man was indicted for forging a
. The case not having concluded that day, the jurors were all
locked up for the night, of course. The next morning it was found
when they were placed in the jury-box, that one of them was too ill to
continue to perform his duty. A medical witness deposed that the
man was suffering from “disease of the lungs,” threatening hºmorrhage,
and pronounced the opinion “that his life would be endangered if he,
was compelled to continue his attendance in the jury-box.” Accord:
ingly, the Judge discharged the jury and ordered a fresh trial, , of
necessity sine die, to the relief of the prisoner's mind, in case of his
innocence, no less than to the advantage and accommodation of the
witnesses and prosecution, whose time may be of no value to anybody,
not even to the owners. - -
All this is as it should be in all, if in any, judicial proceedings which
comprise juries. But what should be is only in cases of felony, and is
not, once more let us repeat, in cases of misdemeanour, though punish-
able with penal servitude. How long will the #. need to
have beaten into their heads the equal necessity of locking up juries
together every night in cases of misdemeanour too, and together
with the gentlemen of the jury, of locking up my Lord Judge?

A PARTY by the name of BRowNING has just º The Ring

are of the book-making fraternity, such a confusion is conceivable.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DRAMATIC COMPETITION.
S To the Editor of “Punch.”
IR,
I PICKED the accompanying parcel up in the street some time
back." It contains some manuscri ... without any names attached.
What does, it mean * I have asked a theatrical friend, who says they
are evidently specimens of style, and intended to assist Managers in
forming an estimate of the writer's ability. I send them to you-I
don’t exactly know why, but I am a little confused after their perusal
—as I have no doubt you will be, but I imagine their appearance in
our universally-perused pages will be the best means ºpletting the
consolate author or authors know where their property has found
its way. Yours sincerely,
A WELL-WishER.

tion to a selection.—Ed. Punch.]
THE REALISTIC DRAMA.
The SCENE represents an Office. Desks in reckless profusion, Charts in
heaps, ". Iron Safes, Waste Paper Baskets, Lists of Sailing
Messels, Almanacks and Ledgers scaffered about with a liberal hand.

awkwardness with the claret-cup), gone; last quick train to Greenwich
gone; MRs. Colon EL CARRAway’s inimitable cook gone; H.M.S. ship
Coon gone; BROWN’s hopes of inheriting his {..i. business gone;
all the seats for BUCKSTONE's benefit gone; most other things in the
commercial world gone. Erit Loup-Voiced CLERK.
Thingummybob. Terrible. But it doesn’t touch our firm. Having
taken advantage of the temporary absence of my partners and the
clerks to commit several forgeries, to tamper with all the books I could
collect, and embezzle as widely as was possible during the hour devoted
to luncheon, I am enabled to snap my ſingers at the commercial crisis.
But am I º No. That º is still my wife, and I cannot marry
the honourable MRs. Fitzswispleton. Oh, father Apºy father

and takes a life-preserrer, a metallic note-book, a thermometer,
and a bor of pepsine lozenges from secret drawers, shakes his fist
at the Portrait of the Junior Partner, over the fireplace, and
erit through sliding panel with a triumphant sneer. Sir detectices
rise simultaneously, and shake their forefingers. Scene closes.

Of slides | }. year has past its phase of sere
And yellow, and is very black and drear;
And those whose rents are greatly in arrear

They really must request that you will clear
The old account. Now don’t be cavalier
To poor relations' shabby clothes, nor jeer
At sentiment, let charity flow freer
At Christmas time, nor check its glad career.

I rejoice most exceedingly therefore;
For my means are so small,
That I’ve nothing at all,

THE MAN WITH AN EYE.—(CoNTINUED.)
THE Man with an Eye, when out of doors is always pickin
what he calls “pretty bits,” and exhibiting nature or art to you
showman.
The Crystal Palace was a great boon to the Man with an Eye, being
a “point of sight” from everywhere. The Man with an Eye is never
tired of the Crystal Palace at a distance. He discovers it in Piccadilly,
and when you are in the middle of your good story, or are about to
make your bow to LADY SUMBODDIE, he stops you suddenly with,
“There it is 1., Look! You can see it from here ſº adding, cunningly,
“You didn't think you could see it from here?”
“See what?” you exclaim, inclined to be unphilosophically º:
“Why,” he returns, almost indignant at your supposing that there
could be two distant objects of equal interest, “The Palace, to be sure.
The Crystal Palace,” he explains, so as to remove all chance of your
saying, “Yes, I see, Buckingham Palace,” and looking in a wrong
direction. The Man with an Eye, being flºº a thorough Cockney,
will, when pointing out some unexpected peep at the Crystal Palace
#: the Seven Dials or Great Coram Street, generally lecture in this
aShlon :-
“Ior', talk of country and beautiful views, you only want to know
London well, and you’d never care about going out of it. Look there!
What’s finer than that f° meaning, of course, one of the above-
mentioned glimpses of the Crystal Palace. - - ---

lam in the Strand with BENTON. He halts, and I find myself face
to face with a dirty little boy selling oranges.
“There !” exclaims BENTON; “there’s a study for a MURILLO.”
The study for MURILLO soon discovering that our object is not com-
mercial as regards his oranges, asks BENTON: “What he’s a twiggin
of a cove for P’’ and treats him to some kind inquiries as to his poor
feet, and announcements of his intention to possess himself at some
future time of his (BENTON's) hat, I point out to BENTON that study.
ing MURILLO in this fashion will bring a crowd about us, and we
move on.
I have noticed that ladies stand in some sort of fear of BENTON.
Why? Because BENTON, in his capacity of The Man with an Eye,
sets up for a critic on dress, its style, cut, and colour.
He will click his glass into his eye (he always does this as if by machi-
nery), and from some safe stand-point will examine a lady's toilette in
detail. If BENTON knows her very well—(he is not a marrying man,
but they think he is, and the wish is father to the thought, for he's worth
catching)—the lady will ask him point blank if he does or does not like
her costume. BENTON will reply cautiously at first, but, overcome #
the compliment paid to his judgment, will end (in al probability) with
a º: condemnation. If unasked, he will advance smilingly, and
beg to be allowed to congratulate Miss or MRs. SKIMMERY upon her
dress. “It is,” he says, “perfect charming !! in exquisite taste!!”

CHEEKY GREECE.
THE impudence of the Greek Cabinet, in pretending to plead inability,
as a constitutional Government, to prevent the enlistment of volunteers
in aid of the Cretan insurgents against Turkey, is wonderful. It is all
very well for a State which is great and powerful in comparison with
another to take 'no cognisance of war levied within its boundaries
against that other. Our Spanish Legion, which helped to place the
Ex-QUEEN OF SPAIN on the throne whence she just been driven by
her people, was very properly permitted, and even encouraged, by the
British Government of the day; because if DoN CARLos had triumphed
we should have been in no danger of a second Armada, or even of so
much as a little and inexpensive war. Our rulers were quite right in
winking hard at the enrolment of Englishmen under the flag of GARI-
BALDI, and that of Irishmen under the banner of the Pope. Neither
VICTOR-EMMANUEL on the one hand, nor Pio NoNo on the other, was
capable of calling us to account. . But it is intolerable that a weak and
diminutive * like that of Greece should presume to take the
liberty exercised in parallel cases, by its greaters and strongers...The
example it should follow is that which they exhibit pending hostilities
between Powers whose strength equals or, exceeds their own. We
tried, to enforce the neutrality of our fellow-subjects between the
Northern and Southern belligerents of America, and are preparing to
ay for having in a measure failed. It is as we behaved to the United
tates, not as we behaved in the case of Spain, and Rome, and Italy,
that the Greeks should behave to Turkey.

No one knows better than the Ritualists themselves that the word

the Church. The “intention,” that is, as Mr. Punch pointed out, “what
they mean by it,” is the point; and as doctrines utterly repugnant to
the expressed and implied teaching of the Anglican formularies underlay
the outward ceremonies and actions, so the Privy Council in con-

A NEW DODGE.
UR attention has been called
to a new dodge for Adver-

used for advertising a

For instance, we might see announced in the leading journals:—

AIDS TO REPLETION.
A LITTLE paragraph, not headed “Advertisement,” is wont to appear
...}* this time in the Morning Post. It informs the sumptuous
classes :—
“The little silver saucepans for warmin
- brandy for mince-pies, plum-
udding, &c., so successfully introduced by
R. HYPHEN, the Silversmith, of
ew Blank Street, are again in great demand, and suggest themselves not only
as most useful, but also appropriate gifts for the approaching festive season.
They are made in three sizes, at 30s., 35s., and 40s. ; with silver lamp and
stand, 40s. extra. Forwarded carriage free, on receipt of a post-office order.”
These elegant Christmas conveniences must be highly recommended
by the Faculty. Medical men are interested in the diffusion of facilities
for ...i plum-pudding and mince-pie with brandy. The more of
mince-pie and plum-pudding there is brandied, the more there is eaten;
for the good of physic...The little silver saucepans for warming brandy
make work for the little brass and º machines for grinding
}. and the little glass graduated vessels for measuring out draughts.
erhaps this consideration may lessen the envy with which many per-
sons regard, the opulent, who are enabled to afford silver saucepans,
with silver lamp, and stand, by the fortunate circumstance of having
entered the world with spoons of the same metal in their mouths.
A PRIZE FOR THE POLICE.
MY WISION OF THE YEAR.
I saw, where a-dying the Old Year was lying, -
And the weight at his heart mocked the green at his door:
He heard pauper-voices, for bread hoarsely crying,
He heard soldiers' tramp, and low thunders of war: -
ere were no friends to cheer him, and small comfort near him,
And his life's lamp burnt low, and his breath laboured sore.
Yet, unloved as he ended, his deathbed was tended–
A cloaked shadow sat in the sick nurse's room, .
Nor speaking nor sighing, like the dead by the dying,
That mute, muffled shade seemed to deepen the gloom:.
Did it bring mirth or mourning, come for sorrow or scorning f–
Was’t veiled spirit of light, or cowled angel of gloom?
As º was nearing, the presence uprearing
To its height, lowly bent by the dying one's bed,
And a hand from the folds of its mantle appearing—
Who could say if to bless or to ban was outspread
Did the shudder that crept through the Year,ere he slept,
Speak of horror or hope, from that hand o'er his head
Even thus the last stroke of December outspoke,
And I knew with the sound the Old Year was no more,
And I saw where from darkness the Young Year awoke,
And heard its clear pipe and light step at the door;
And the great shadow gathered the folds of its cloak,
And stood by the bed, muffled, mute, as before.
Then I knew 'twas the shade of the Future, arrayed
By the Dead Year with new might to bless or to ban;
But the darkness upon the cowled features that played,
Still baffled the effort their promise to scan.
And I waited the Young Year’s encounter to see
With that awful presence past reading of man.
With his childish laugh ringing like silver bells swinging,
Came the Year to his heritage frolic and free,
Nor shrank as its broad shadow over him flinging
That dark presence fronted the child in his glee:
No fear froze the joy of the jubilant bo
As he faced the cowled features, ...} climbed the veiled knee.
Then I knew that, though dim, not unlovely to him
Was the face of that º: nor threatening its eye,
And that under that veil was no aspect more grim
For the Year I saw born than the Year I saw die. . .
And I woke as from clouds rose the sun's crimson rim,
And the fair light of morning enkindled the sky!
CHARITY AND COWERT SHOOTING.
Is it the gamekeeper, or the butler, or the toad-eater, we wonder,
who, when the DUKE or PHEASANTON has had a big battue, is so foolish
as to advertise the details in the newspapers? -
Advertise F Well, yes; such paragraphs must surely be inserted as
advertisements. Unless they were paid highly for, assuredly no editor
would spare for them a corner of his valuable space. Can it in the
least degree ever interest the public to learn that LoRD BLAZEAway
and half a dozen noble swells have butchered in cold blood a pyramid
of pheasants and a hecatomb of hares? True sportsmen shrink with
horror from such wholesale acts of game slaughter, and no one but a
toady or a snob could find delight in hearing of them. “What great
men do, the less will prattle of: ” and snobs and toadies love to read
about a lord, be it but a tame description of his slaughter of tame
pheasants. - - -
We could suggest a way, however, by which, the list of birds and

the papers lately have shown
that the practice of º: has
gained ground. “If the Person
who took the sable muff by mis-
take will send it to such and
such an address, the Other (with
a capital Oj will be returned.”
Of course the Person will not
restore the 'sable muff; but some
purpose is nevertheless served by
the advertisement. The sable
muff will be spoiled spoil for the
- Person. A similar advertise-
ment calls upon some amateur thief who snapped up a not uncon-
sidered silk umbrella, with a buck-horn handle and twisted silver-
wire, mount, to return it forthwith to its disconsolate owner, who
would seem to have placed it confidingly against a chair in a city
tea-shop. The pitiful rogue, who could not keep his hands from
picking and stealing, when he saw that umbrella momentarily un-ſh
watched, was probably not of the class of professional shoplifters, nor
would he have stolen a publican's pewter pot from the railings of a
back street in the suburbs. But he is as fit a subject for the prison
hair-cutter to operate upon, notwithstanding. The buck-horn handled
umbrella with silver mount will not be given back; but its new pos-
sessor will be unpleasantly troubled to account for the strange acquisi-
tion, to people who have the dishonour of his intimacy.

“The new Banking Establishment [Norton & Co..], possesses, moreover,
what no other private bank in Paris can boast of, viz., a burglar and fireproof
room, where depositors can themselves lock up their valuai, es, &c.”—Paris
Correspondent of the Illustrated London News.
DETECTIVE TRACKHAM observes that this is the first time he ever
heard that, it was an advantage—something to “boast of"—for a
bank, whether private or public, to possess—a burglar!
ONE OF THE MISERIES OF LONDON.
MR. Pusch's Compliments of the Season to the First Commissioner
ºf Works, and hopes that he will do something to make the streets of
this Dirtopolis a little more passable; that, as a new broom, he will
sweep clean. Some people have to walk.
SENSELESS suggestion.
A GENT said he supposed that opera buffa would be performed at the
Gaiety Theatre. He suggested that, for the performance of oratorios
and sacred music there should be a Melancholy Music Hall.
IF THIS SHOULD MEET THE EYE of the gentleman of the name
of SMITH, who was dining somewhere in London on the first of Aprillast,
he is entreated by his friends to purchase Punch's Almanack, and to benefit
his health by having a good hearty laugh at its enjoyable contents.
ODD MEN OUT.
THE MAN WITH AN EYE-(ConcLUDED.)
THE remaining aspect under which the Man with an º is to be
considered may be looked upon as scarcely within the classification
under this genus. And yet it is a species legitimately placed here, as it
seems to the present writer, who would name it the Man with Half an
Eye. This Half an Eye is not in reality physical, but mental, and its
power is properly applied to taking cognisance of motives and inten:
tions rather than of external actions. For, though it must in most
cases of necessity depend upon the outward deed for its judgment of
the inward thought, yet is it equally true of the Half-Eyed Man, that
his half-organ iº. receives such impressions, as the visible
action was not intended to convey. Hence it may be taken for granted
that nine times out of ten the Half-Eyed Man, while priding himself
upon his acute perception, is utterly at fault in his conclusions. It
will also be at once seen that the Half-Eyed Man has something more
than “a blind side”. it is indeed a blind three-quarterface.
The Half-Eyed Man is, in consequence of this blind three-quarter
face, intensely suspicious. - - - -
He is also painfully self-conscious: as self-conscious as is a man with
an iron-mould on his evening shirt-front, or a middle button off his
dress waistcoat at an evening party. - - ----->> 1.-
He uses his Half-Eye to see that every one is going to “do” him. .
* He sees what he calls the “little game” of the man whom he is
obliged by society to greet as his friend, or, at least, as an acceptable
acquaintance. - - - -
§. congratulated Fº his success in any line, he will tell his
confidential friend that “he saw with half an eye that you didn't mean
what you said.” - - - -
He is a mischief-maker, for he promulgates his half-eyed opinions as
certainties. -
He'sees ſº MRs. BLAIZE in a box with CAPTAIN Du Sºpswell,
while MR; BIAize is engaged at the House or on some important busi-
ness which prevents his attending in his place by his wife's side at the
Opera. Immediately our friend “sees with half an eye what’s up in
that quarter,” and intimates that he could put the scandal beyond a
question were he so minde --
He is fond of alluding to himself as “Any one” and “One.” For,
mistrusting everybody, as a person so gifted must, it is most, unlikely
º * terms should be applied by him to any other individual than
mselt.
Thus he will listen to your friend º: upon the beauties of
some horse which you are thinking of purchasing, and will tell you
afterwards that “Anyone could see with half an eye that THUMPER was
umbugging you.” - -
Naturally annoyed at this construction put upon your friend
THUMPER's description, which you had taken to be strictly true, you
ask your Half-Eyed Man his reason for such an opinion.
You will find he has none; and, in lieu of a reason, will give yent to
a pooh-poohing laugh at your inexperience, and will repeat, as he goes
away (he always contrives to go away at this point
anyone could see it with half an eye.” And then he leaves you with
a variety of pleasant impressions upon your mind to the effect that-
1st. You yourself are an ass.
2nd. That THUMPER is a knave.
3rd. That the horse is unsound. - - -
4th. That the Half-Eyed Man ought to have warmed you in time;
and, finally, you “wish to goodness that people wouldn't say these sort
of things :” and if you are going to dinner you sit down “with what
appetite you may.” - - -
e sees with half an eye that the object of your affections is a flirt.
He sees with half an eye that “something is going on” between
Miss CUMLEY and MR. Fopp. -
He sees to the bottom of a mine, and cautiously keeps his º out
of it. H it succeeds,-well then anyone can see with half an eye that it
won't last.
His motto, in fact, is, that ol a ready-money dealer's—“No credit
given to º -
And so with this agreeable sketch I close the series; and upon the
public table, side by side with my collection of a Few Friends, I lay
my album of Odd Men Out.
A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all!
A Double DAY-The last of 1868 Christmas Days came on a
Friday. Was not Christmas Day, then, Good Friday too?
G9 TO JERICHO! or if you prefer it, go to Paris, or Calcutta, or
Owyhee, or Jerusalem. Go where you will, in fact; but first of all
be sure you purchase Punch's Almanack to amuse you by the way. Better still,
buy a few thousands to distribute on the journey, and thus help to civilise the
savages you meet.

January. No turnips for cattle. Everything dear.

“Dear me, you don't say so : " I do say so. Now
then, where's your bacon? Gammon : There won't
be any Spring this jº. Ruin, utter ruin, unless
this stops pretty quickly.
March, Floods, of course. Just as everything was
getting to-rights. Distress fearful. There won't be
any grazing land this year. No birds—nothing.
Grass utterly ruined. Land soddened. We'd better,
all we farmers I mean, emigrate.
April. Things beginning to grow: good prospects.
Three *. sharp frost nipped everything again.
No grass for the young calves. Cows feeble. Price of
labour enormous. Ruin to the farmer. Can't get
any work done. Weather so uncertain, requires
double the number of hands to get it over quickly.
Ruin, Sir. Better emigrate.
May. Well, we had looked forward to this month.

weather, and plenty of it.
June. “This fine weather?” It may be fine for

there's what's called a Glorious Harvest, every
sign of it everywhere. So it is if we could only
pay for the lobour. But the farmers, Sir, can't
et the labour. It's no good my having twenty
elds ripe with corn if I haven't the hands to cut
it: nor the horses to cart it: nor people to buy it.
and only make a loss by exportatiºn. Why, a Glu-
rious Harvest is absolute ruinto the farmer.
August. Thanksgiving services everywhere, of
course. Sheaves hung up, and the like, because
we’ve got three weeks of fine weather. We want
rain, Sir, rain. The farmer, Sir, (I speak as a
farmer, and reverently) is as thankful for small
or large blessings as any one else. But what's
the good of a plentiful harvest to the farmer now?
I know there won't be any wheat in the country
by November. No, Sir, times and seasons have
changed, and the farmer loses every year.

We want a week or two offine, dry weather.
October. Hot as summer. Play the very mischief
with everything.
November. Seasonable weather—apparently: but
bad for cattle. There'll be the disease again with
a fortnight's time. What we want is rain.
December. December 1 more like April. what
we want is dry, fine weather. “Turnips, Sir-"

Egonomy. For Swells—Two sixpences are better than a
shilling. You must sometimes tip your inferiors, and you
cannot ask them for change.
Mental Exercise for Idiots-If the Great seal is in

Ye maids, that practise wicked arts,
and eke young widows with light hearts;
Gay guardsmen, and pet parsons dear,
and all such heartbreakers, see here!
I charge you all, and every one,
To waste no loveye may have won,
For fear of this grey limbo, where
all you fine flirts that ever were
ºf either sex, shall bud and blow
As grafts on rooted stems, and grow,
lºor many around of days and years,
self-watered with your own salt tears,
And wipe your eyes on your own leaves,
For Jack of pocket-handkerchieves!
and wet your lips at your own cost,
To whistle for the loves you lost,
That these may cast their eyes, and sco
Fit cause to kiss, and set you free-
For if by dint of tears, or trace
of some old unforgotten grace, -
You chance to charin a stray kiss out
of lips you once were fainto flout,
Then may you pluck yourselves, and up-
Your leaves for pinions, if you choose,
To soar upon, and seek for peace;
Thus, only thus, the spell shall cease.
And trust une, yºu shall not, I trow,
Be beautiful and bright, as now .
Your features shall be modelled then
By Mr. Punch's smart young men
And here your victims, great and small,
Shall whisk about you, one and all ,
With banded wings like butterflies,
And, oh! such beautiful big eyes!
and eyelashes an inch at least,
And ail their wealth of locks increast !
and faces brighter than of old,
and beautified a billion-fold, 3
And little else but face to show,
For having buried long ago -
Their bodies, and the broken hearts
That plagued them so, in foreign parts,
1n fact, such faces as you see
In keepsakes wilded gorgeously :
And they shall have sweet kisses too,
But none to waste on such as you!
No! they shall either cut you dead,
or take to teasing you insteau.
and point at you. and poke their fun.
And try your tempers, one by one,
and raise false hopes and lay thema low,
And pout their lips to kiss, and go!
so shall they nip you in the bud,
or leave you sticking in the mud,
That you may rue your tickle days
of dancing, and yºurjilting ways:
Till haply you shall culminate
In quite a vegetable state,
and even run to waste, I wis,
and all for want of one pour kiss.

A CODE FOR FIRST-CLASS CABS.
BY THE EMPEROR OF UTOPÍA.
IN order to distinguish him, every first-class cabman
must be dressed in a court suit: white silk stockings,
satin breeches, shoes with silver buckles, jewelled sword,
embroidered waistcoat, gold-laced coat, frilled shirt, and
powdered wig.
Every first-class cabman must wear lavender kid gloves,
and none of larger size than eleven and three-quarters will
be passed by the police.
#. must be conversant with English, Scotch, French,
German, and Italian, and, as a civil servant, must have a
civil answer ready in any of these languages which his
hirer may prefer.
For the usage of bad grammar, every first-class cabinan
will be fined, upon conviction, the sum of half-a-crown ;
and will be sentenced to a month's imprisonment for any
stronger imprecation than “Bless me !" or “My eyes!"
If found smoking in his cab, while waiting for a fare, he
will be fined half-a-guinea or imprisoned for a week.
He will, however, be permitted, when off duty, to smoke
upon his box, provided that he smokes only sixpenny
cigars, and is careful to ignite them with wax allumettes.
Every first-class cabman, must provide some first-class
literature for the benefit of his hirers; such, for instance,
as the Times, the Quarterly, and Punch.
He must on all occasions be able to give change, and to
a lady must deliver it in a clean, soft, scented envelope.
In case any dispute arise as to the fare, a first-class cab-
man must produce a gilt-edged book of distances, with a
map and ivory rule to measure every mile.
THIRD QUARTER.
FIRST QUARTER.
PUBLIC NOTICE.
The Council of the
Zoological Society will
be glad to obtain, either
by gift or purchase (the
former mode of acquisi-
tion preferred), the fol-
lowing interesting ani-

collection is at present
deficient:"—the boome-

There is an obvious pro-
priety in going out to

Motto for Sheffield
(wil EN well-BEHAved
AGAIN.)--" Foremost in
the files of time."
First-class cabs must all be furnished with yellow sain
cushions, and a crack of an inch long in any of the windows
will be held sufficient cause why the licence be annulled.
Every first-class cabman must carry in the luvgage, not
merely to the hall, but up to the top attics, if he is asked to
do so; but for this cytra service he may claim, if so in-
clined, a glass of dry cham le.
In order to insure rapidity of transit, every first-class
cab-horse must be lineally descended from a winner of the
Derby, and a pedigree to prove this fact must be displayed
inside the cab.

FARM NOTES.
How to Winnow Corn. 1st. Method.— Get some corn. Get
some body who knows how to winnow it. Lºt him do it.
2nd Method.—If you know all about it, do it yourself.
3rd Method, for Beginners, given in Agricultural Terms.
Place a steward near the blower, and let him drive the
blower while the hopper is filled with a large wecht.
(This is called the system of Hopperation.) Then let a
woman with a small wecht slide down on a wheel crushing
the blower with her shoes. This should be done in a neat,
cleanly way until the scum has been swept with a besom
through a wire screen, while anºther lot go on riddling.
when it is the duty of the fanner to answer each riddle as it
comes out. The fanner's chief work is, however, to prevent
any labourer becoming too hot. When a labourer is very
warm, he sits down before the fanner who soon restores
him to coolness.
Treatment of Fowls in Winter.—Roast them.
For the Volunteer-farmer in Winter.—Attend turnip drills.
How to Pickle Pork.-Get the hog into a proper tempera-
ture. To bring this about make him swallow a small
thermometer. This 'll warm him. Rub him with paper
dipped in oil, give him a uniform coating of barley, tar
syrup of squins, pitch, and gºld tin-foil"Paint his head
green with orange stripes, and by that time he'll be in a
pretty pickle. -
Breakfast.—Always visit your poultry yard before break.

Remember that, where eggs cannot be obtained, a yoke of
fine oxen beaten up with a cup of tea is most invigorating.

So marvellously small it
Then in high dudgeon did he use
To feel himself all over;
But little sinew, and nothews
Could Richard's thumbs discover;
And wickedness is rarely met
In men that play the flageolet.
At length a happy day came round
(Which I was there, and drew it)
When Richard liſted from the ground

Almost one foot three-quarters high
And that with ladies standing by 'l

MATRIMony MADE EAsy.—A young lady is in want of a
husband. She is intelligent, amiable, and accomplished,
but not pretty. She advertises for a blind man.
THE Force of HABIT.-A literary friend was overheard

proof sheets on his bed.
There lived a youth (he liveth yet),
And Rich ARD was he christened;
And well he played the flageolet,
And all the ladies listened;
And some were even heard to say
His brow was handsome (in its way).
But 'twas not yet too late to mend;
He got dumb-bells, and shyly,
He took the counsel of a frien
(“Experimentum vili")
And tried them first on his left arm,
And found they acted like a charm I
Not only that ; he, on his head
So dexterously caught it
That all the ladies present said
They never should have thought it!
And ever. I could not but own
'Twas hard lines for the paving-stone !
But Richard met REN BALL, a man
All chest, and cheek, and shoulder
And cver so much bigger than
Himself, though little older;
Whose biceps Richard felt and found
It measured fifteen inches round !
Much bigger waxed his biceps, but
when this left arm was finished,
The left lobe of his occiput
Had sensibly diminished;
So then he went it, right and all,
To make his nut symmetrical l
Next day he caught a cold, alack
And all his muscles vanished,
But none of his old brains came back
Which his dumb-bells had banished;
And not a rack was left behind
Of what he chose to call his mind I
Now this demoralised him quite;
And then he took to reading
The naughty books that ladies write
And found there, with exceeding
Dismay, that ladies' heroes are
Wild, wicked men, and muscular !
His nut soon got so hardened that
It hurt you when you hit it;
Nor could his hatter find a hat
(Alread made) to fit it,
grew,
As all may judge from this back view.
Poor Richard now (0 have you met
Him lately) has grown bitter;
For when he plays the flageolet
The ladies talk and titter;
And no one ever thinks his brow
In any way good-looking now !
O little men, who wish to please,
Be wiser than r Dick 1 shun
Bigfriends with brawny bicipes,
And female works of fiction;
Bu stick to music all your might,
Or be cut out. And serve you right!
