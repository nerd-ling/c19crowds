FREFACE.
66 WAS obliged to ask you to meet me, MR. PUNCH,” said the EMPEROR, “and this was about the only place where
we could meet without fear of listeners. Deign to accept my apology for having asked you to pull out into
mid-channel in such weather.”
“Don't mention it, MAJESTY. I am the Old Salt of the Earth, and shan't melt in the sea. I am at your
Majesty's service, so far as that is consistent with my devotion to Balmoral.”
“Would I injure your admirable balmorality, my dear friend ? You will confer a benefit on all Europe by
advising me at this crisis.”
“I advise your MAJESTY to light up.”
“I imitate you in this, and in much else, MR. PUNCH. And now to business. “No man of many words am
I, as our friend DU MAURIER saith. You have noted and considered my Elections 2"
“Habeo, Sire; which is Latin for, I have.” -
“And what do you deduce.”
“A Fact and a Lesson.”
“The first 2"
“One half of France, and that half which contains the Brain, has unmistakeably pronounced against Personal
Government. You see, Sire, that some personalities cannot be tolerated by civilised society 2”
“You put things pleasantly,” grumbled the EMPEROR. “But the fellows on my side don't want cleverness.”
“I should say that they did not, Sire. They must have a good stock in hand. For they never use any.
Even the work of managing your elections with reasonable decency very few of them have done. Half your victories
are moral defeats. But never mind that. You have out of the 290 men in the Chamber 213 of your own to 77 liberals,
42 real, 35 red. Are those the figures?"
“Are you ever wrong?"
“Never, Sire. I may take that slight credit. Well, your President can frown on the Opposition, and stop any
mouth that is uttering disagreeable things, and a majority of 136, like a certain commination,
“Answers every doubt so eloquently well.”.
“Ce cher Byron.”

iv PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [July 3, 1869.
“Wee, Sire. But there is another passage in the writings of that misguided party but meritorious poet, and
though the splash of these infernal waves interferes with the effect of my elocution, I take leave to recite that passage.
“Still, FREEDOM, still, thy banner, torn but flying,
Streams like a thunder-cloud against the wind,
Thy trumpet voice, though broken now and dying,
The loudest that the tempest leaves behind.”
“I am not given to sentiment, Sire, but it is liked on the Continong. Will you extract my meaning in the
above recitation ?" -
“I understand.”
“Why then rejoice therefore, Sire, as the Divine WILLIAMs observes. For I credit you with meaning well. To
understand where one is, and to intend to act rightly, be twain steps in the road to honour. I believe I am spoiling
True Thomas of Chelsea, but he loves me and will pardon."
“Have you visited the French Gallery in Pall Mall?"
“Aye, Sire, and with pleasure."
“On the East wall is a portrait of a Boy." -
“A princely Boy, Sire, and you desire that years hence the catalogue that describes his portrait should call him
what his father is now is called. Rem tetegi '"
** Acu.”
“He will be Emperor over free men, Sire, or no Emperor at all.”
“Bridge the space between fact and lesson, MR. Punch. You say half, and the half which ought to have
Ascendency is my enemy. Am I to throw the gates open to him 1"
“Do you prefer that he should batter them open 2"
“Batter,” said the EMPEROR, with a kindling war-glance that swept the Boulevards. “I had an Uncle.”
“They say so at St. Helena,” said MR. PUNCH, kindly. “Come, Sire, you are a better man than he, and too
good for thoughts like those. If a nation cannot be governed without a constitution of cannon, it is not worth
governing. Do you believe that of the France you have recently discovered to be noble?"
* I am bewildered,” said the EMPEROR. “Holdfast is a good dog, as your proverb is.”
“There was another dog, Sire, who wanted more than was good for him, and so lost all. Our WILLIAMs has
said, ‘'Tis better using France than trusting France,' but on my honour, MAJESTY, I think you might act on the
opposite rule."
“And trust France?”
“Half of which—yes, Sire, in spite of that. Because France, which is generous, would then begin to trust you.
Conquer France, Sire. Nobody else can do it. It will be a grander campaign than any of your Uncle's, and it will
have neither a Moscow nor a Waterloo."
“I will think about it,” said the EMPERoR, moodily, turning away his canoe and raising his hat.
“Don’t think too long, Sire,” cried MR. PUNCH as His Majesty departed. And read to your young Prince my
fifty-sixt; ºnlimt.

LA CHASSE.
“Sweet-cheek" was a pretty term of endearment a couple
of hundred years ago. It might be revived with appropri–
ateness; for not only are the cheeks of our young ladies
uite as sweet as those of their ancestors, but to do some of
them justice, their characteristic is—of course the nicest,
but still—cheek.

mouse is not now to be found on the Catskill Mountains.
THEATRICAL.-Not the least important part of the ma-

like more than ever masculine
Women.

It may not be generally known

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
TU DAY, December 29. The House of Commons sat but for one
golden hour, and did nothing but cheer the Ministers, and issue
some writs. But mark you now how the hand of a great artist shall beat
Qut that gold, and give you a longsome and important article. The
fact is that the nation has setup such a clamour for “a lot of Essence,”
as the nation inelegantly puts it, that we cannot deny it such a New
Year's Gift, the less that it will get no more until Wednesday the
24th February.
Fact is, Mr. Punch had some doubt whether it would be prudent in
him, as the father, of a family, to resume this Essence at all. For he
had been so horribly i. ever since the Reform Act passed, at
the terrific ...; of those who called it a Revolution, that he slept
for weeks with revolvers under his pillow, and only discontinued the prac-
tice because they slipped down to his toes, and went off in the night to
the discomfort of his household. Chaff the new Parliament, he thought.
Never. And he beheld in his mind's eye furious mobs electing savage
DANTONs, and MARATs, and, RoRESPIERREs, who i. formed
themselves into a dreadful tribunal, erected a guillotine in Bride Court,
and brought out Mr. Punch to look through the National Window.
Doubtless he would have met his fate with decency, but to say nothing
of his much preferring not to die at all, consider his life assurances
which would have been vitiated by his execution. He shuddered, and
resolved that there should be no more Essence.
Then he hid himself, (as it is all over, now, he doesn’t mind saying
that it was in the least likely place in all England to be searched, the
abandoned lighthouse on the top of the hill in the enclosed gardens at
Purfleet) and made calculations. He discovered that the Reform Act
would add one Million to the electoral rolls. As this fact flashed upon
him, he became so dreadfully ill that it required all the kindness and a
reat deal of the champagne of the excellent hotel at Purfleet to bring
im to * like a comfortable state.
But he held on somehow, until the elections began: Then, unable
to behold any frantic mobs, except through the mind's eyes of some
of his *.*. he gained a little courage, and abandoned his
fears of the National Window. But he said to himself in a legible
whisper, “They are going to elect men like the leaders of the Reform
:ague, pretentious, stuck-up folk, of that detestable class that can
neither give nor take chaff, or of that more detestable class that can
WOL. LWI.
only give and can't take it.” And then he thought of a majority of
Forcible Feebles having him 3. up to the bar of the House of
Commons, and asked how he d smile at the Representatives of the
Millions. “I will never go, down on my knees and ask pardon,” he
said, with a revival of his t spirit. “I have too much pluck, and
respect, for my silk stockings for that.” But whether the Essence
should be written or not bothered him, and he asked counsel of friends,
who talked to him the usual nonsense of Friends in Council—not
MR. HELPs's, who are the wisest and most delightful councillors he
OWS.
The Elections were over, and again he fled away to his lighthouse to
consider the returns. You should have seen him come smiling down
the hill, and along the road to order another banquet. He struck the
stars with his sublime head. A Revolution;. You be disestablished!
A Revolution, you disendowed fool! Nothing like it. A Capital
Good Parliament, whence he deplores sundry exclusions (as MILL's
Roebuck's, and Rauce's) but, composed for the most, part of ood
men and true, of all parties, but with a great majority pledged to
support his friend PEELIDEs. Educated, wealthy, some titled, all
vowing to be governed by no ignorant constituents, but by a resolution
to do justice to all men. And the average age of a Parliament-man in
1869 is Fifty Two—just the age that a wise man ought to be—until he
}. º #: * º: fact settled him, * º: º,that the
ssence of Parliament, should appear again, and, Ilke 0 .
with fifty thousand additional #. every week. , And he pledge
himself to do it, too, and took the pledge in Burgundy. -
Which pledge—the former, he now #. to redeem, and wishes a
Happy New Year to the nation in pledge the latter.
As hath been said, the Commons met, and the newly re-elected
SPEAKER took the Čhair, which means, sat down in it. Took has
various meanings, for which see Tooke's Diversions of Purley, and you
will not find them.
The Ministerial benches were about half filled, out this must not be
taken as ominous of ministerial half measures. With Falstaff, we
hate an unfilled can. But what would have been the use of a large
attendance? There was nothing to do. Why should men spoil their
Christmas holidays * Echo answers with a profession of inability
to make a satisfactory response. There were very few Opposition

Members. Why should they have come, when there was nothing to
oppose, except a beestly driving small rain f
MR. DUNDAs took the oath (we’ve only one little oath now) and
his seat for the Orkneys. These are islands of the north, and were
called Orcades by the Romans, but they were known to the ancients
before the circumnavigation of Britain by AGRICOLA, who, as his name
implies, having been a husbandman, easily learnt to be a navigator, and
might have made railways, if he had thought of it.
MR. GLADstoNE, Premier of England, and Member for Greenwich,
was loudly cheered on his entrance. We shall always think the better
of Greenwich for having made such good use of its new franchise, and
shall be happy to show our satisfaction by accepting any invitations to
meet pleasant people at either of the great fish-houses. By the way,
there has been a plentiful lack of imagination in the Greenwich cooks
lately, and we hereby order them to invent a Something a la Gladstone,
and ſº it be an excellent good thing, and let us have no humbugging
with old enemies under new names. Somebody says that Punch is a
roclaimed Epicure. So he is, but where did EPICURUs place pleasure?
}. virtue. And is there no virtue in a good dinner? If not—why does
it—or what is meant for it and never is-precede an appeal for a
Charity? Away, and vex not thougreat Punch's mind With thy shallow
wit, Wex not ; u that creature's mind, For thou canst not fathom it.
Various Ministers took the oath, but the Right Honourable John
BRIGHT made affirmation strong as kiss of Holy Writ. This reminds
us of an American story, which has nothing whatever to do with MR.
BRIGHT's case. A poll-clerk, fancying from a voter's hat that he was
a Quaker, asked him whether he would swear or affirm, to which the
§.in a pleasant manner, replied, that he was disendowed if he cared
Wnic

believe, somewhere in Ireland, but we should be louth to say we know
where, up and spoke
The LoRD BURY, son and heir of the EARL of ALBEMARLE, the
Lord of Quiddenham Hall. This frightful Revolutionist (mind you,
we don’t like it; read CARLYLE, and see how at the beginning of the
French revolution certain young aristocrats who had been in America—
and LoRD BURY has been in America, and we dare say will declare
that he is very happy indeed to have been there—began proposing to
abolish old customs–Bury, too—that has a funereal kind of sound)
this frightful Revolutionist, we say, inaugurated the destruction of all
things by complaining of the inconvenience occasioned by the law
which compels the re-election of those who take office under the Crown.
He thought he should venture to move, hereafter, for the repeal of
that law.
Between ourselves, the rule, very proper when Sovereigns were
more despotic, and could force a Minister on the nation, has become
simply a foolish nuisance, when Ministers can hold office only by permis-
sion of Parliament. But then it was made in the days of the good QUEEN
ANNE, and it would be disrespectful to the sainted memory of MRs.
TRUEMAN to repeat it. Besides, if you begin abolishing, when will
you leave off? It is clear that the spirit that would abolish an old rule
merely because it is useless and mischievous, would abolish the Throne
and the Altar, nay, the very Precession of the Equinoxes. The House
of Commons said nothing to the titled Revolutionist, but let us hope it
thought the more, like the Welshman's Bubo, or Owl.
More new writs were issued, including one for South Derby, where
the vacancy has been caused by the second demise since the general
election. Eight more of the Administrators have got to issue
addresses, take long journeys in vile weather, make speeches, and
come home again, in obedience to the law of the good MRs. TRUEMAN.
Her correspondent, DUchess FREEMAN, would tell her, if they lived
now, that the law was nonsense, and if SARAH didn't put a strong
word, such as disestablished, before the moun, her manners would be
shown to have mended in Elysium. -
Nextly, we had some Notices of Motion, but they were mostly given
by new Members, whom the gentlemen in the gallery had not seen
before, and of course were not bound to know. There is a vast lot of
these in the Parliament, and it would be well if each new man would
get his name legibly printed in large type, and paste (or gum) it upon
the top of his hat. The outside of his hat, we mean, Irish Members.
Then the reporters would notice him as he liſted his hat on rising (or
he might hold it up towards them for a moment) and his fine
oratory would not be set down to “an honourable Member,” or to a
wrong person. MEssRs. HANSARD would, no doubt, print such a |
thing on moderate terms, or an M.P. may come to Whitefriars, and
sit in our office while the MS. is being set up—only he must bring
his own cigars.
Of the notices, one was ament Local Taxation, one for the Legisla-
tion of Trades' Unions (hal spirit of RobespierRE | \, one for making
English and Scotch bankruptcies alike, one (this was for MR. ToRRENs)
about the asylums for the sick poor, and one (this was by M.R. LystER
O'BEIRNE) for leave to brin; in a Bill to facilitate the acquisition of
small estates in Ireland. This is a very desirable object, and MR.
O’BEIRNE may acquire a small one for us, if he will be so good. Or,
on second thoughts, a large one. And—we are ashamed to trouble
him—but would he make it in England, as we are desirous to reside
upon it, and do not care about crossing the Channel? He shall come
and see us whenever he likes, nobody welcomer.
MINISTER AYRTON, Joint Secretary of the Treasury, then moved
that the House, at its rising, should adjourn until Tuesday the 16th
February. And being interrogated (we mean asked) as to whether
the meeting was for business, fie made as brief reply as the American
General, in that capital new poem, when told that
“Dat Bummer der Breitmann ish holdin' der ford "
He replied,
º e ."
Then did such of the Commons of the Kingdom as had attended
disperse, without making any particular Revolution to speak of. But
we shall watch them, and prepare to bolt at any appearance of danger
to ourselves, or to the State.
SOBRIETY OF ELECTION.
THE suggestion of the Right Honourable the PRESIDENT of THE
BoARD OF TRADE, that the public-houses should be closed on the
nomination day at elections, deserves to be considered. There are,
perhaps, some constituencies in which a certain amount of drunken.
ness prevails, even amongst the class of British electors who cannot
afford to spend, any of their hardly-earned wages in excess of drink.
Certainly, it might be in a great measure prevented by the closure of
the public houses; but would not that be an ill compliment to the
toiling millions of this great country? It is surely at the top of
society, as much as at the bottom, that we are to look for drunkenness,
and it would be an invidious distinction to close the public-houses
without closing also the private cellars, and the clubs.
A voter, who gets drunk at Election time, gets drunk on duty. He
unfits himself for the exercise of that exalted privilege which is the
birthright of every Briton above the residuum. For an elector to be so
drunk as not to be capable of giving the name of the candidate whom
he means to vote for, is to be drunk and incapable indeed; certainly
to be incapable of performing his lofty constitutional function. indeed
it may be held that any elector so drunk as not to be able to say, dis-
tinctly, “British Constitution,” is politically drunk and incapable.
Suppose, then, gross drunkenness, apparent at the hustings, is sub-
jected by the Legislature to disfranchisement, temporary, or final.
Qn the one hand the public-houses might remain open, and the pub-
licans suffer no injury. On the other, constituencies would be weeded
of unworthy voters; of course to the sole detriment of a bigoted and
stupid faction and to the unqualified advantage of the party of
enlightenment and progress.
CHINS AND CHIGNONS.
MoUsTACHE and beard we did not wear
When I was young, days long ago;
But modern girls no longer care
If swells have bristly mouths or no.
Not only shave not fogies old,
No good by shaving who could gain,
But gallants, in an age less cold, -
Who would have shaved, nor shaved in vain,
Moustaches only in the way
With soup a fellow now can find;
But if he will take soup he may :
At any rate the soup won't mind.
Sparkle on the Bench.
WE find, in the Era, the following piece of wit, emitted by the
Chairman of the Petty Sessions for the Enfield district of the Duchy of
Lancaster. A brace of rogues, male and female, had cheated a pub-
lican, and were sent for trial. The male requested that the female
might be released on bail, as he would be bound for her.
“The CHAIRMAN. 0 yes. The prison walls will stand bail for both of you.”
True wit on the bench is so rare that Punch at once immortalises
this Chairman, and recommends him to MR. GLADstoNE for Chancellor
of the Duchy.

as heretofore, has been numerous and select, and trust to merit that liberal

HAVE PITY ON THE UNLEARNED.
“MR. Lowe, perfectly aware of the ox on his tongue, justified his reticence
on the broadest and most elementary grounds.”
REALLY, newspaper writers should remember that it is not everybody
who has had the advantage of a classical education, and if they must
deal in allusions which those who have small Latin and less Greek can-
not be expected to understand, the least they can do is to add a word
of explanation, or a foot-note. Mr. Lowe, with an “ox on his tongue,”
proved a hopeless puzzle to numbers of painstaking readers who
conscientiously try to make out the meaning of all they see in print.
His admirers only hope that it is not some dreadful disease with which
the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER is threatened.
Area of Force v. Force of Area.
THE falling off in the security of our streets is ascribed to the great
extension of the area of Police-duty. This is very true, and may be
put in another way. Not only is the Police too small for the area, but
the area is too much for the Police; or to put it dynamically, “The
action of the force is in an inverse ratio with the area.”
QUITE RIGHT, MY DEARS.
ALICE, CONSTANCE, DAISY, EVELYN, GeoRGINA, SUSETTE, and a
great many more most charming but slightly illegible correspondents,

to women, they have unanimously formed. BRowNING's new poem,

In Europe as to cut a serious figure,
Then there may be some chance for your audacity,
At present you are not of that capacity.

BEWARE OF TRAPBOIS.
Is there any sufficient reason why sending a money-lender's circular
to a minor should not be rendered punishable And ought that act to
be made less punishable than the offence of sending a threatening
letter to anybody? -
If, however, the paramount importance of Commerce requires that
the liberty of advertising shall be unbounded, might not some protec-
tion against usurers be afforded to infants by a certain relaxation of
the law of libel? If TRAPBOIs must needs be allowed to advertise
himself without restriction, let it be lawful to advertise TRAPBois.
Let parents, preceptors, guardians, clergymen, philanthropists, any-
body and everybody, have a º: to post TRAPBoIS all about the
Universities and over camps and garrison towns, or any other places
in which TRAPBOIS is likely to catch, youth. “Beware of TRAPBois.”
“Keep out of TRAPBois’s Clutches.” “Borrow not of TRAPBOIs, the
Usurer.” “Who’s TRAPBQIs? A Bill Discounter—lends money at
sixty per cent.” Such are the sort of ºff. with, which it ought to
be lawful to bill the hoardings, dead walls, and railway-stations, or to
put the unwary and inexperienced on their guard by, means of a
watchman with a staff and a lamp displaying a nocturnal illumination.
THE CRIES OF THE SEASON.
A STRIKING illustration of the late extraordinary mildness of the
season occurred, the other day, on the Basingstoke platform of the
London and South-Western Railway. A boy ran along a train which
stopped there, shouting, “Any apples, oranges, lemonade, soda-water,
ginger-beer?”
If the weather shall have changed, will that boy and other boys,
touting, the trains, cry, “Any taters-all-hot, kidney-puddings, wine,
negus, brandy, rum, gin, whiskey, spirits-and-water, punch?” They
may add Punch's Almanack. But both that and this periodical are to
be cried at all seasons and decried at none. -
“A Bloated Aristocracy and a Bloater Church.”
“John Knox” confides to Mr. Punch his opinion that, “Like all
people between two stools,”. Ritualists, must come tº the ground,
They are neither Protestant nor Papist, “neither fish, flesh, nor good
red-herrin'.”
Neither fish nor flesh, perhaps. But Punch must demur to the rest
of the description. ... Many Ritualists are “good,” a few are not only
“read,” but “well-read,” and all, without exception, are “errin'.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON MR. MACKONOCHIE, &c.
R,--I don’t often write to
you, but having last week
sent a letter to the Times,
it occurs to me that the
next best step to be taken
is a communication on the
same subject to you.
The Judgment, Sir, of
the Privy Council is but
an exposition of various
Acts of Parliament, show-
*E. ing what is the Law on this
matter of Rites and cere-
monies in the Church. of
England. It is not binding
upon the consciences of
* Churchmen. It does not
prevent them from beliering
whatever they choose to
believe. Therefore they can
hold all Roman Doctrine,
even the supremacy of the
Pope in a certain sense, as
long as they do not out-
- - - - - - wardly demonstrate their
inward convictions. This is what I mean by “the Loss of modes of
outward, expression of belief only drives pious souls more inward,
and the inward devotion shines the more through.”
Since writing the above I have been led to consider the full import
and bearing of my argument, and I discover in it a new moral code for
the benefit of society at large.

I have been accused of too
heretics and Dissenters by my own party, and I may again incur its
displeasure by stating boldly, that deeply, sympathise with all those
unhappy criminals hung or unhung, and with those no less unfortunate
sufferers in civil actions, who have been unable to evade the legal
penalties which they have severally incurred.
This is a legitimate conclusion from my own premises, and from it I
do not shrink.
What, Sir, is any Judgment, Criminal or Civil, but “an Erposition
of an Act or Acts of Parliament **
And, as such, not binding upon the conscience of Englishmen.
The felon, unfortunately for him, being in the dº. and guarded by
police, cannot walk out and snap his fingers at Judge and #. as Call
an Anglican Clergyman at LoRD CAIRNs, the ARchbishop of York,
and all the Privy Council.
Now, Sir, I will conclude;
all Ritualists—
No matter in what precise terms our belief is condemned; no matter
that Bishops and Archbishops equally condemn all our distinctive
tenets; no matter that the spirit and tone of the entire English Com-
munion is against us, we can always meet a Judgment as we should a
Temptation, and find a way to escape. Words may mean anything,
everything, or nothing. . Actions shall be valuable or worthless. But,
with the exception of a few absurdly straightforward and honest men
who are no longer with us, we have shuffled and shirked from the
commencement, and, please Heaven, we will shuffle and shirk to the
end.
And, dear Sir, who shall prepare the net out of which we Ritualistic
Eels will not wriggle? I am, Sir, yours

P.S. In effect, I would say, with old Mr. Weller, “Why warn’t

ings would have to be commenced de novo.
A Rubric Well Ruled.
DR, Pusey complains that, the Judicial Committee have not inter-
"preted, a certain Rubric, relative to the MACKoNochre case, gram-
matically. They will generally considered to have interpreted it
according to, its obviously intended meaning. , DR. Pusey must not
expect worldly judges to interpret even Church law in a non-natural
Sense.

Jeudi, et aussi de PUNCH. Go and get his Almanack, if you still are in the
sulks. It is a certain cure for jealousy as well as indigestion.
A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD BETS.
FQQLs who fling, away their fortunes by betting upon horse-races
would do well to take a leaf out of the betting-books where wagers like
the following are registered. We quote them from a recent icter
º America, inserted in the Times:--
“Ludicrous election bets are now being paid in many places. The losers
are made to saw wood and do other menial things, while sometimes the loser
|wheels the winner through the streets in a barrow, preceded by a band of
music, and followed by a gaping crowd. In New York one bet was paid by
the loser wheeling a negro through the streets, and thus practically testifying
his regard for the African race.”
| We heartily commend this novel style of betting to the noble race of
plungers who now gambol on the turf. How much better to wheel
your winner in a barrow, than to hand him over, a handful of bank-
notes! There really is no fun in emptying one's pockets, and the
process of exhausting one's credit with one's banker can º:
...; although done for sake of sport. Bets, however, of this kind
reported from New York would afford both entertainment and pleasant
occupation to men who find their time hang so heavy on their hands
that they are forced to kill it by going on the turf. To the philosophic
mind a ºl. theme for contemplation would be the sight of noble
swells being wheeled about the streets, each preceded by a band of
music and a banner, on which should be placarded the name of the
loser, and the wager he had lost. Instead of ºf “ thou’s” and
“ponies,” as young foolish plungers do, they might, by betting rides
In wheelbarrows, effect the needful time-s i. without º
their estates. By way of a variety, perambulators might be use
instead of wheelbarrows, and, in lieu of bands of music, a blast of
'penny trumpets might º the conquering better in his passage
through the streets. Other wagers too might fºllow, such as drives
about Hyde Park in a costermonger's cart, or rides upon a donkey in
the thick of Rotten Row, with the season at its height. Young GREEN
may book a bet that if Darkhorse wins the Derby, he will have to black
his face and plºy the banjo for an hour upon the doorstep of his club;
or LoRD ToM NoDDY may record that in the like event, he will have to
shave off one of his pet whiskers; and to go for a whole fortnight with
a cabbage-leaf instead of a camelia in his buttonhole. . Bets too may
be made that men must give up smoking sixpenny cigars, and for a
given time must condescend to common “Pickwicks;” and wagers
will be laid that, if Skyrocket wins the Leger, LoRD SwellingtoN will
have to carry a baked 'tatoe can twelve times along Pall Mall, or
ENSIGN GUzzleR will have to drink mulled ginger-beer in lieu of iced
º; and, instead of whitebait dinners, will be reduced to tea
and shrimps upon his next six trips to Greenwich.

SMALL BEER CHRONICLES.
TWO EPITAPHS FOR A BIRD AND A CAT.
| I.
| A Cat of our household killed a pet bird. The victim was buried
with as much pomp as a stable-boy for gravedigger, the cook, and the
housemaid as mourners, could give to the ceremonial. On the tomb-
| stone I inscribed -
“Rara Avis in Terris.”
Neither the gravedigger nor the cook nor the housemaid understood
it; the latter, indeed, . on the score that the canary wasn't laid in
a terrace, at all. If the lower classes had been educated, they would
have understood this classic epitaph.
II.
Our large dog killed the cat, that had killed the bird. We were
indeed much grieved. Two of the softer sex wept. One of the sterner
interred the remains of poor Pussy, and another of the same persuasion
wrote o'er her silent tomb,
“Requies-Cat.”

“OH, THE MISTLETOE BOUGH ! ”
Greengrocer, Jun. (to whom our Little Friend in Velvet had applied for a piece of Mistletoe for his own private diversion). “I’ve Got YERA
BIT, MASTER GEORGE.
(OLD SONG.)
IT AIN'T A VERY BIG PIECE, BUT THERE's Lots o' BERRIEs on IT ; Aw' It's The BERRIEs As Does IT / / / "
TELL THIS TO THE MARINES.
PUNCH never allows an empty bottle to be called “a Marine” at his
table, without º: the good old explanation of the image—“A
good fellow who done his duty, and is ready to do it again.”
He hates to hear the Marines chaffed, because he knows them to be
about the least indulged, most devoted, hardest worked, best drilled,
best set up, best officered, best disciplined, and best behaved corps in
the Service: and because at the bottom of the chaff occasionally fired
off at them by dandy and empty-headed officers of more “swell”
branches, there lies, nothing more respectable than snobbishness, con:
ceit of caste, and pride of privilege, the natural enemies of unfavoured
merit, continuous hard work, harassing service, and uncomplaining
devotion to duty. -
As for Jack's half real, half affected antipathy to “sogers,” that is
another matter. There is a natural antagonism between blue jackets
and red coatees, white-duck and pipe-clay, loose order and drill, stocks
and shirt-collars, schakos and straw-hats, buttons and lanyards... But
that does not hinder each Service from respecting the other at bottom;
and both from pulling, working, and fighting together on all occasions,
like twins of the same bull-dog.
For the same reasons that Punch don’t like to have his Marines
chaffed, he is sorry to hear that the Plymouth Manager has so far
forgotten himself, as to poke fun at the #. Officers in his Panto-
mime. He is still sorrier, however, to learn that the Marine Officer in
command of the corps at Plymouth has condescended to notice this
piece of bad taste by forbidding the Marines the theatre.
CoLoREL PENRose should remember that the proverb, “de minimis
non curat,” *. as well to military law as to civil.
After all, Pantomime impertinences should no more give offence
than Pantomime red-hot pokers burn. We never heard that Police-
man X was a less formidable guardian of the peace because of the bad
time, he has of it at the hands of Clown and Pantaloon; or, that the
butcher, baker, and greengrocer of private life were more liable to be
taken sights at because of the gross insults perpetrated on their order
in the comic business, for which their shop-fronts usually furnish the
background, and the proprietors the victims.
But, even if the s were more likely to hurt, noblesse oblige.
The Marine should be above bandying buffets with the Manager.
the Marines like to stay away from the theatre, let them, but don’t
enforce their absence by pickets.
At the same time one cannot be sorry if the Plymouth Manager
should suffer for his impertinence in insulting a body of men who are
far more of an honour to their cloth than he is to his. We never heard
of anything that was particularly to his credit. We never knew anything
that was not pre-eminently to theirs.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I AM a very social girl, and also very scientific, so I always
read the reports of the Social Science Meetings. I see that at one of
º: mentioned in the Standard (I am a Tory girl) D.R. STALLARD
said, -
“If only one quarter more of the dirt of London could be swept away than
now is, how great would be the gain.”
Dear Mr. Punch, the gentlemen should be reasonable with us. I am
sure we women do what we can. My dress is very long, and I never
loop it up, not that my ancles are bad, but because it is absurd to care
about saving the clothes other people pay for. And I never come in
from a walk without bringing in more than my fair share of London
dirt with me, to say nothing of cigar-ends, orange-peel, herrings'-tails,
and other trifles, and the way my i. go on at me for what they
are pleased to call slatternliness, and how they name me DoROTHY
DRAGGLETAIL, and sing stupid songs about me, would daunt anybody
but a female who scorns to be dictated to about dress. Really, we
cannot do more than we do, and I only wish you could see my stock-
ings, and the state of my Mamma's new Turkey carpet.
Yours sincerely,

SUPPLEMENTARY TREASURY MINUTE.
To be appended to that composed by Mr. Ward Hunt, and published
by Mr. Ayrton.
My Lords, adhering to all that has been set forth in the above
Minute, in regard to the extravagant habits of certain Civil Servants
(whereby, and by reason of the embarrassments into which they plunge
they are the less qualified to attend to the Business of the Nation) bu
holding also that prevention is better than cure, annex the following
suggestions.

down thereupon the amount of their º }. they sub-divide
this, with the aid of a Ready Reckoner, into fractional parts, so that
they may see how much hard cash they ought to spend daily, weekly,
monthly, "; and yearly.

had nothing but pocket-money from his parents, but let him look at it
thus:-

present ill-regulated state of society, involve paying or owing for.
Now he may have £200, £300, or º i. highest of these

421 0 0
Which leaves him the handsome, but scarcely adequate sum of one
shilling and elevenpence for the expenses above enumerated, or for his
wife, if he has fascinated a Girl of the Period into marrying him.
\fy Lords are aware that there are many other ways of muddling away
an income, but they have no intention to be severe, and merely suggest
that the first sum which a newly-appointed clerk should do, might well
be the sum of his own happiness. Examination of income, on the
above º will, they are satisfied, do more to produce the desir-
able effect in the mind of an honest young gentleman, than all the
thunder which they have deemed it necessary to emit in the hopes of
scaring the Service out of its extravagance.
By ". of showing that, while urging others to reform, they can
amend their own customs, My Lords propose, at the beginning of the
ſºº to pay all salaries monthly. Young wives will be glad

BIRDS, BEAST's, AND FISHEs.
CHAPTER THE FIRST-OF THE HAPPY FAMILY : THE
FIRST BIRD OF THE LOT.
FROM the Preface which was honoured, I hope, by your perusal last
week, you will have learnt the object of this present series. If you
have not, I should be inclined to go over the same ground with you
again, did I not recollect that at the end I should be no further ad-
vanced than I was at the beginning, and moreover I should be com-
pelled, at the request of º had seen neither this chapter nor the
initial one, to accompany them also along the old path. . .
These two concessions would form precedents for a third, and then
Heaven knows when the first Chapter would begin. -
And besides the above considerations, there recurs to my mind the
excellent advice given by the celebrated Mr. Ducrow to a dramatic
author, “Cut the dialect, come to the osses—that’s amoosin’.” -
No one knew better than that equestrian genius wherein lay his
strength. Peasants might defy proud nobles behind the footlights,
and be dragged off by the tyrant’s “creatures” to the deepest dungeon
beneath the castle moat, heroines might utter sentiments the most
virtuous, and keep the double-dyed villain at bay with his, the double-
dyed villain's own sword, but to “’osses” it must come at last; and
'osses meant to MR. DUCRow what the people had not only “come for
to see,” but the amusement of the evening, without which the
audience would not go away satisfied, even if they left at all,—the
attraction that drew the metal into the Manager's pocket.
Cut the dialect and come to the 'osses. Cut this sort of semi-
preface and your apologies for not giving us another—for which
nobody axed you, Sir, she said—and come to your beasts, or your
irds, or your fishes, §ſr. Showman; one by one, or two and two, in
Noah's-arkical fashion; or all together, as they used to be when the
Happy Family occupied “the finest site in the world” (I quote some
celebrated person), between the Great Basilican Cruet-stand, commonly
called the National Gallery on the one hand; and on the other,

And the above description, flows out of a space six feet or so, by

BETSY WARING.
(On Ecclesiastical Westments and novel Ceremonies.)—AIR: “Jenny Jones.”
YoU knows “Betsy WARING,
What goes out a-charing,”
Likewise for an airing
On Sunday I go.
To Church at eleven,
Or P.M. at seven,
To 'ear about ’eaven
And—what’s down below.
I likes when my teachers,
The reverend preachers,
Send tears down my features
A running: and, oh!
I’m sometimes a-weepin',
And sometimes a-sleepin',
But always a keepin'
Respectful: just so.
I’ve old fashioned notions
About my devotions,
Which I takes, like my lotions,
At the proper time.
I’m fond of a sermon,
And º: about Hermon,
And hymns to a German
Tune; which it’s sublime !
I likes the prayers said out,
The Colicks all read out,
With them we are fed out
Of Scripsher alone.
'Tis a block for my stumblin’
To hear parsons mumblin’
With the organ a-rumblin
Years back, cast your eye up,
The pulpit was high up,
The reading-desk nigh up
To that ; it was then.
His head just emergin'
And dressed gown of serge in,
Sat droning and dirgin'
The clerk his “Amen.”
But now that’s all knock'd down,
The Clerk’s somewhere cock'd down,
And boys, whitely frock'd, down
The Church walk demure,
The “wersickles” singin',
The “innocence” a-swingin',
And sparks about flingin',
I hope they insure.
The Curate, a spooney ’un,
Sings the Communion;
His voice is a tuney ’un
At a slow rate;
They separate “the sexes,”
Which some people vexes,
And they sing all the teres,
While handin’ the plate.
They crosses and blesses,
Wears wonderful dresses,
Their names no one guesses;
I was fold; so you see
They call 'em “dam-maticks,”
And that’s like Rheumatics,
Which I wish them fanatics
We don’t have no hossacks:
The clergy wear “ cossacks,”
Which fit as they won sacks
Tied in with a band .
They calls lessons, “lections;”
They makes “Jennyſlexions”
In various directions,
I don’t understand.
They’ve one papist Massy bell,
They wear “cope” and “chassybel,
Which makes me irascible
As a Protestant taught
To call all this flummery
“Papistical mummery: ”
They do—this my summary–
What they didn't ought.
If Bishops don't stop it,
The Clergy won’t drop it,
The rich folks up prop it,
Well let ’em, I say.
I’ll put my golosh up,
And ToM’s maggintosh up,
Till I find where to washup
In the old fashion'd way.
They’ve “chassybel” and “cope” too,
They’ll soon have a Pope too,
I must say I hope to
See them go to Rome:
Oh drat them fanatics
As wears them dammatics,
Yes, I’ll stop, with rheumatics,
To give 'em a tone.
Could feel 'stead o' me.
Next Sunday at home.

LONG LIFE TO THE LIFE-BOATS
“LIFE let us cherish,” as an old song says, and therefore, as another
old ; says, let us “Man the Life-boat.” Now, you Gentlemen of
England, who live at home at ease, and sit cosily at dinner with your
napkins on your knees, how many lives, do you suppose have been
saved in the last twelvemonth by the Lifeboat Institution ? Just look
at this account of its year's labours in life-saving :-
“This long list makes a total of 570 lives rescued by the life-boats of the
Institution from the above-named disasters, in addition to twenty-four vessels
saved from destruction. During the same period the Life-boat Institution
granted rewards for saving 259 lives by fishing and other boats, making a
grand total of 829 lives saved mainly through its instrumentality. In the
same period the crews of the life-boats of the society, at a very large expense,
have either assembled or put off in reply to signals of distress 150 times to
ships not eventually requiring their services.”
And look at this account of work done since its starting:—
“The number of lives saved either by the life-boats of the institution, or
by special exertions for which it has granted rewards since its formation, is
#3; for which services ninety gold medals, 792 silver medals, and £28,906
in cash, have been given as rewards. When we remember that nearly ever
life saved by life-boats has been rescued under perilous circumstances, it .#
at once be seen what great benefit has been conferred by the Life-boat Insti-
tution, not only on the poor men themselves and on the country, but also on
their wives and children, who would otherwise be widows and orphans. Since
the beginning of the present year the institution has spent £18,813 on its
194 life-boat stations on the coasts of England, Scotland, and Ireland; and
since its first establishment in 1824 it has expended £212,820 on its life-boat
stations.
Britons often brag about their British “institutions.” Now, is not
this an Institution which we may well be proud of P and should not
every great Briton, and small Briton, who is rich enough, fork out like
a Briton for the Life-boat Institution?
A Trifle from the Rock.
We have rarely read a better thing than this, which we find in the
Home News for India :-
“Whether we give up Gibraltar, or do not, there can be no hurry. We
should like the Spaniards, in the first place, to show themselves mindful of
two things; the Bonds from which England delivered Spain, and the Bonds
which Spain has delivered to England.”
If Indian readers are often treated to brilliancy like this, no wonder
they don’t think much of LoRD MAYo.

THE CHEMISTRY OF QUACK HAIR-WASHES.
MR. PUNCH,
TRUTH is stated in the letter in the Times of the other day,
headed “Poison for the Hair.” My hair has got very grey—but I am
not very old—so my hair is greyer than it ought to be, and I look older
than I am. Hence I have people, on occasion, offering me their arms,
as though I could not walk without assistance. Unless I take care to
spring into an omnibus, my entrance is generally expedited with a
helping hand by the RICHARD BAxTER of a conductor; . A

that I must expect this, that, or the other at my time of life. All this
is a, bore, and if. I could renovate my hair, at least to a shade that
* not be ridiculously out of keeping with my visage, I shouldn't
Imlilol.
Sir, a bottle of wash fell in my way, purporting, by a statement with
which it was labelled, to be a restorative of the hair to its pristine
colour, but no dye. if I had believed this I should have used the
wash, in order to put a stop to the civilities and incivilities with which
eople, according to their natures, are accustomed to annoy the aged-
ooking. But I suspected that it contained sugar-of-lead—the parent,
by absorption, when rubbed into the system through the scalp, or any.
where else, of painters’ colic and palsy. , So I got a spoonful of it
#. me, not to buy a bottle for several shillings, and to this, Sir, I
id add a few drops of iodide of potassium dissolved in water. Let
any of your readers who flatter themselves that they are renovating
but not dyeing their hair by the use of any such popularly advertised
wash, go and do likewise. If, then, the wash thus tested is struck, as
I found it, a rich yellow, the lotion is leaden, and their heads will be
more so if they continue to use it.
Ah, Sir, the best thing to prevent the hair from turning grey, and
without which nothing will ever restore its colour, is the blessed cer.
tainty of a sufficient income. It is the winter of anxiety that crests
the head with snow, and makes a Mont Blanc of a man be he never so
stumpy. If Nature has endowed him with reflective faculties, and

Fortune has not endowed him with an assured competence, no wash
that is not a dye will avail to renew his hair, so as to improve it to any
colour from that of mouldy, if not, CANISSIMUs.
Twelfthcake Day, 1869.
FINNIS AND THE FARMER.
PUNCH has a propensity for praising, Aldermen, and it is a shame
that they do not more often give him the opportunity of iºlº it.
He pounces upon a case in which he has that happiness. A Norfolk
armer of substance (for he occupies 700 acres) was brought before
MR. ALDERMAN FINNIs, last week, charged with sending up abomi-
nably unsound meat to the London market. When the charge had
been proved, MR. ALDERMAN FINNIs observed that a fine would be no
unishment, and therefore he favoured the substantial but unrighteous
armer with a sentence which probably involved some—he sent the
farmer to the House of Correction for a month. The rich are in no
danger from such rascality, they pay hideously extortionate prices, but
they get good meat; but in the interest of the poor, who are poisoned
§ carrion food, Mr. Punch heartily thanks ALDERMAN FINNIs for
the example made in the person of FARMER DoDD, of Great Ryburgh,
Norfolk. ...We imagine #: it will be very safe indeed to deal with
that bucolic personage, when he shall have returned into the peaceful
groves of his county.

it might be called but isn’t,

Stoy LE, the basso, on two
ingeniously contrived cro-
codiles ; but it is not, to
my thinking, very funny.

GAN's Transformation Scene
equal either to his last year's
performance, or “the clock”
one in Cinderella; neverthe-
less it is sure to be popular
on account of the lavish
display of foil, tinsel and
bright colours. By the way,
Mr. HARRIs is a very clever
man; but why does he
always come forward to
bow whenever great 'ap-
plause greets some scenic
effect: surely he can’t do
everything at Covent Gar-
den? Perhaps, though, he
does, and I didn't know it;
so lest I should make some
other egregious mistake, I will, with the kind permission of my friends
in front, pass on to
Drury Lane.--Charmingly pretty: specially adapted for young chil-
dren, and to old boys, it is {{...}. real pantomime fun. The Puss in
Boots is played by MR, IRVING, who sings and dances capitally. There
is a good î. bit of burlesque on the sensation scene in After Dark.
The Cat is shut up in a basket, and breaks through to save his young
master, whom villains as cruel as MEssRs. WALTER LACY and MuRRAY
at the Princess's have laid across the track of Tofºno, not the train, but
the Miller's Wheelbarrow, which is driven on with all the noise, shrieks,
and .# music that announces the approach of the velocipede
engine and third-class carriage in MR. Boucic AULT's piece. MR. CUM-
MINgs, as a Notary, sings a well written song, detailing the legacies in
a will, which would be encored in a smaller house. The Comic business
by MR. Clown & Co., (there are a double set), is full of “hits” of the
|. year, all more or less telling. Had I two hearts, I had left them
oth with Mademoiselles the Columbines ; but not being so provided,
I could only envy MR. HARLEQUIN, and console myself with a pinch of
snuff, subsequently, at the house of everyone's esteemed friend and
“dear boy,” Paddy Ever-GREEN’s. -
The Lyceum is also a capital boys’ and girls' Pantomime, and is
remarkable among other matters as containing only one allusion to
somebody of the name of SMITH. We shall return to this subject next
week, as the legs, or corkscrews on which MR. Woles dances deserve an
especial notice, and the Transformation Scene is one of the prettiest
and most tasteful of any we have witnessed.
By the way, among #. signs of these Theatrical times is the fact,
that at four Theatres in London are now singing and acting four young
ladies from the Music Halls. The Gaiety has one in Miss Constance
Loseby : Covent Garden one in Miss NELLIE (why not ELLEN ? was
she christened NELLIE *) Power : the Queen's one in Miss KATE
(Catherine surely, not KATE, sweet KATE) SANTLEY, and Drury Lane
possesses Miss HARRIET CovKNEY. -
Perhaps the Music Halls are not doing so particularly well just now :
certainly I see that no spirited Proprietor has yet got the Oxford.
The Gaiety, in MR. GILBERT's Qperatic-burlesque of Roberto, presents
good Christmas fare; and MR. WIGAN’s personification of the Mounte-
bank is the salvation of a crude piece. This theatre, I suppose, is
oing to take up the Opéra bouffe line, and I hope its management will
ring forward some English talent which is only waiting such a chance.
The lobbies of this house being still, of course, rather damp, are fumi-
fº by “RIMMEL’s vaporisers.” This is not mentioned as a
ar from it: but if MR. RIMMEL will only put some of his deficious
rfumes (and he has got some) into these machines, I will mention
im again with pleasure. The Gaiety stalls are comfortable, and the
house is brilliant. Here Venus and Mars wait upon the worshippers
of the Comic Muse—that is, amiable young ladies take your coat, if you’ll
let ’em (and you can’t refuse), and commissionnaires take your tickets;
amiable young ladies offer you books and refreshments, commissionnaires
briefly, }. politely, tell you where to go; and more amiable young
ladies curtesy you to your seat. These nymphs were, I was informed
by a sly dog who knew all about it, trained behind the counters and
stalls of the Alhambra. Perhaps so; but no matter:, they are very
nice, and here’s a health to all good lasses, merrily take your opera-
glasses, º the stalls and boxes round. - -
..What can I say of the Haymarket? MR. 80th ERN is back; with
him the Hero ºf Romance as Yº: as ever, After this piece is ended,
you will see MR. KENDAL's performance of Wynyan the Frightful Hair:
and if you've not seen HERH BANDMANN, you'll see MR. KENDAL in
a travestie on his part which is better than the original: if you haven't
seen BANDMANN, never mind, see KENDAL. Any author of travestie
receives his reward from MR, Compton, who plays burlesque in its true
spirit, seriously, and makes every line tell, when it has got #!".
tell in it; and when it hasn't, why his delivery makes you think it has.
Miss Ion E BURKE sings and plays, well throughout, and comes out
very strong in the last scene as a barrister. By the * talking of
good music (I wasn't, I know, but suppose we suppose I was), MR.
ENDAL gives MR. ARTHUR Suſilvº's Figaro sort of song from his
Contrabandista admirably. Not a note or a word is lost.
This was only intended as a sort of prelude to one of the usual dra:
matic sketches made in the front of the house, which, Ladies and
Gentlemen, I shall, with your keyind permission, call the Man in the
Box, and which I will give you next week; or, not to be too particular
as to dates, as soon as possible. -
.***...Why do actors ordinarily say “Skee-y” for sky, “ * for
kind, “Leeeew-cy” for Lucy, “Ha-aven” for Heaven? &c. This is not
new ; but no explanation has ever been given. A Pronouncing Dic-

PUNCH'S REVIEW,
Kelly's Directory for 1869.
THIS notice is simply apologetic. We have laid down one rule for
ourselves, from which we will not depart. . We never review a book
which we have not gone through from beginning to end, ing such
notes, for reference, as may occur to us. Christmas has, somewhat
interfered with our examination of this Directory, and we have as yet
got only to the north end of Bourerie Street, E.C. Thus far, we have
found no fault, and we may say that the fºliº work appears to us
to contain everything that anybody can by possibility want, and a
great deal more. But we are approaching a most interesting and ex-
citing part of the composition, and we will spoil neither the pleasure
of our readers nor our own by forestalling. We are rejoiced to see
that the author is unflagging as ever, and that his stores seem to be
inexhaustible.
Music and Patriotism.
MR. SIMs REEves is carrying the point for which, with true artistic
feeling, he has long been .# in his own interest, no doubt, but
not less in that of the singing world., M.R. HALLá, among other cele-
brities, has given in his adhesion to the proposed reform. The English

English Tar bow before the standard of France, Jammy, Mounseer.
That, we are adamant about.

ut slightly irritating, to MR. BENNETT or MR. MACKoNochi E, and a
positive assertion that ARCHDEAcon D—N in early life held Pela-
ian opinions, and that DR. P−Y was inclined to adopt the tenets of
MANUEL SwedENBoRG, will make the after-dinner hour pass pleasantly,
if the clergyman near you shows by his vestments and conversation that
he would prefer the stake to having his candles put out by that extin-
guishing Lord CAIRNs. You can have no hesitation as to what you
should say to the foolish young creature whose hair, now of golden
lustre, you remember was shabby colour when you met her twelve
months ago at the LUMLEY GILLsoNs: remarks on the destructive
character of dyes and washes and the diseases their use brings on
including hydrocephalus, malaria, madness, and impecuniosity, from aii
of which several of your own friends and relatives have had hair-breadth
escapes, will fill up the intervals between the quadrilles agreeably,
and if you are of a jocular turn, as you go round the room, and the
room goes round with you in the waltz, whisper, that you suppose
women always were, ºld always will be, dying or men. Your popu-
larity with boys in the holidays will be unbounded, if you can encourage
them to give you the date of the foundation of ancient Rome, or the
leading events in the life of NUMA Pompilius, with a translation off
hand of “Mea mater sus est mala,” or any other scrap of catch Latin
you can think of over dessert; while, if you desire to make yourself
agreeable to their sisters' governess, the readiest way will be to invite
her opinion as to the best manuals of geography, chronology and
calisthenics. -

are sorry to hear such an account of the mothers of Young France.
On the whole, we are glad that no such marriage right exists in Eng-
land, and that if there did, we have no theatre for its exercise, Flippant,
stupid, sensational, our theatrical º may be, but they are
nearly harmless, and would be quite so if managers were aware, how
very inexpensive, thanks to free trade and improved machinery, femi-

OUR POLICE.
SIR -
> - -
Two subjects have lately been prominently before the public in
the Times—our §. and our Theatricals. The galleries of our
large, theatres when, pantomime is played are crowded, and in the
crowd must necessarily be a large proportion of pickpockets, from the
professor to the graduate, from him to the under uate, and so to
the pupils at Fagin's preparatory school for young gentlemen. Well,
Sir, what do they see ? ...Sir, the object which most excites their
laughter is the Policeman ill used by Clown, and treated with contumely
all .g. by that speckled ruffian. -
Now, Sir, as long as we permit the representative of law and order
to be thus assailed and exposed to public ridicule, how can we expect
minds, naturally leaning towards evil, to be imbued with the majesty of
those principles which are embodied—or embobbied—in the persons of
our protective force I used the word “Bobby” just now. At t
time, when it is proposed to erect a new statue to that eminent
legislator, Šia RoBERT PREL, can we find no better way of sustaining
his fame in the Metropolis than by calling the beings of his creation
“Bobbies,” and occasionally “Peelers”? -
... There is only ºne thing in which ºf Qught to imitate Cloºn; that is,
in calling him “Mister Policeman.” This is a step in the right direction;
but to call out, “I say, Bobby,” and then lie down before the station
door, &c., in order that seven constables, one after the other, may fall
over you and hurt themselves, is not a model for imitation.
I remain, Sir,
Yours, EDUCATION.
VERY INDUSTRIOUS.
Follow the little shoeblack home, who has been brightening your
boots in these dirty streets, and you will find that his work is not yet
done, for you will see him busily polishing off his supper.
THE OVEREND AND GURNEY AFFAIR.
MR. PUNCH is certainly not going to forestal the decision in the
OverEND AND GURNEY case. It is before a Mayor and an Alderman,
and until they shall have said their say, he reserves his. But he wants
to protest against the case bein ed “great,” in compliance with
the foolish habit of the day, which takes bigness for greatness. It is
only great because a great deal of money was lost and a #. many
§. were ruined. And the fate of MEssRs. GURNEY, BIRKBECK,
ARCLAY, GoRDON, and RENNIE, ought not to be affected by º:
except justice. They are accused of a º offence, and they declare
that they can refute the accusation. The allegation is that they frau;
dulently constructed a Company, whose assets largely consisted of bad
debts, that the men who sold these debts, to the Company were insol-
vent, and that those who bought those debts knew the circumstances.
h;|It happens that the old firm of QyeREND AND, GURNEY is charged
with having owed Twenty Three Millions, and with having had to set
against this only Twenty Millions of doubtful assets." The †† may
be disproved, as º charges raised by the prosecutor, DR. THoM,
and his solicitor, MR. Lewis. But the case, should be argued apart
from the *...* of figures, and as if a firm of Tripesellers in a
back street behind Holborn had owed £23, and set over £30 tº a
Trotter Company, Limited. Let right be done, and let us have no false
moral perspective.

THE RITUALISM OF TERPSICHORE.
A certAIN man went the other night to a ball at past ten o'clock,
and he did not come away till three. He believes he left the whole of
the dancers behind him, except two young ladies and their Mamma,
whom he took away—he is bound to add, at their own time. Nobody
else, that he knows of, had gone but a gentleman who did not dance,
and who did not care to stay because he could only get claret:
§ and not any brandy-and-water. , The gentleman might have danced
if he had remained, but then again he might not, for there is no affirm-
ing the converse of Weng salia; sobrius. . Indeed that aphorism itself is
not altogether undeniable. The companion of those three ladies danced,
and he was never drunk in his life—on duty. He danced attendance,
to be sure—that was all.
. By the way, he would fain remind the numerous girls whose educa-
tion has enabled them to construe Latin, that the insobriety pro-
nounced by CICERo conditional to dancing, does not necessarily impl
brandy-and-water, or anything like it, or even so much as claret-cup. It
is quite compatible with nothing stronger than Adam's ale; as teeto-
ers often demonstrate by their demonstrations.
He has heard serious people object to *:::: If they would but
go to a ball and see any, they would find it no ". matter. He
can assure them that the most part of dancers go through the amuse-
ment of *. round and round, and wheeling in prescribed direc-
tions, with perfect gravity. , In one dance, indeed, named “The
Lancers,” this man, who never for many years witnessed any
dancing out of a theatre, where it was incidental to some otherwise
rational performance, beheld a sort of gesticulation ceremonious to the
degree of absolute .#. The parties concerned in this action
stood facing each other and bowed half-way to the ground. An idea
then struck him. He .# it would answer the purpose of a com:
poser of dance-music to publish a Ritualist Quadrille, with a coloured
rtrait of MR. MACKonoch IE in full pontificals on the face of it.
t occurred to him that a dance illustrative of Ritualism would afford
ample scope for the display of grace and elegance in congees and genu-
flections, and that the Terpsichorean rubric of chassez-croissez, especially
croissez, might be executed in characteristic style. Also that occasion
would be aforded by a Ritualist Quadrille for wearing the most mag-
nificent vestments, liable to no possibility of prohibition by the Privy
Council, that flowers might be exhibited in profusion, candles burnt by
gas-light, and eau-de-Cologne or kiss-me-quick could do duty for
Incense.

It is the opinion of a good many free and independent British

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“HOME.”
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
Not having written any beautiful plays for the last forty or "
fifty º may I write a word in the way of a theatrical notice? You
see that f cannot be suspected of wishing to Fº ºly except
myself, yourself, and the rest of the population of the world. -
Get a stall at the Haymarket. } like those stalls, because there is
room to pass other people without making women frown and men
scowl. Also there are º three rows, so that you can catch the feeling
of a real pit, and I am old-fashioned enough to like to see how a play
works with the groundlings. Go and see Home, the new Comedy by
MR. Robertson, a gentleman who writes plays which are very much
to the taste of yours truly. He makes real men and women, and lets
them talk as men and women do, but elevates and points their talk,
giving it dramatic purpose, and I suppose this to be true art, distin-
guishing dramatist from playwright.
There may be some French in the pedigree of Home. I don’t know,
and I don't care. There is some in my own pedigree, but I am English
enough, and so is the play.
Having told you to go and see it, of course I am not going to tell
you the plot. It is a very pretty one, however, and the main business
is the deliverance of a father, by a son, from a marriage which would
i. have had its disadvantages, though the lady turns out much
better than we expected, and the scene in which she does so is charm-
ing, and charmingly played by Miss CAvendish. The effect, upon
the other characters, of her touching revelation of a history of trial,
: º change from dislike to sympathy is in the spirit of high-class
omedy.
MR, SoTHERN plays the son, an Englishman who has served in the
American army. It suits his quiet, observant, incisive style, and it is
creditable to him that so far from taking lion's share in a play produced
for his sake, he has been content with a part which, º it is the
pivot of the piece, is anything but showy. His self-possession, and
never-flagging attention to his own business and everbody else’s give
great finish to the performance, but an actor gets little credit for this
with most folk, who do not hold with the doctrine that it is art to con-
ceal art. They like to see points worked up to and made ..".
I do not. . Mſ. SotherN's scene with Miss HILL, when both, bein
earnestly in love, are awkward and embarrassed, is another bit of re
º: And when Miss CAVENDIsh's true nature is seen, and
M.R., SOTHERN who has previously shown bitter, contempt for her,
suddenly bids his pure and pretty little sister shake hands with her,
the touch of generous atonement hit the house hard. [I use the curt
old phrases, Mr. Punch, Sir, because I am writing to you. Believe me,
dear Sir, I have the amplest assortment of Mºjº: for my genteeler
lucubrations whence }". eliminate all conventionalisms and
colloquialisms.] Finally, MR. SøTHERN showed much humour, espe-
º when grumbling at himself.
R.,Co.MPTON's part is the one which stands out. He is a sordid,
.."; drunken ruffian, with a red, face,’ and moustache. That
sounds disagreeably, doesn't it ! ...And the part would be disagreeable
in the hands of sº but this Master in his art. By Jove, Sir,
though Mountraffe is such a rascal, you are never angry with him. He
is so cool, so satisfied with his debasement, so good-naturedly uncon-
scious that he ought to be hanged, that—I, really won't say that I
didn't almost wish The had got a certain £20, which he had Jºãº On
“...for himself.” MR. CQMPTON never showed a richer humour, or more
of what an artist can do than in somehow redeeming this scoundrel
from hate. But you have not to learn my opinion f MR. CoMPTON,
He and I worked together towards the end of the last century. Ha! h
Sir, there was a character called Bottles—but the present generation
knows not what CoMPTON and EPICURUs can do in conjunction.
A word for Miss BURKE, who had to be very young indeed to suit
her little young lover (very intelligent and modest, MR. Asti.Ey, I
think you’ll do), and who looked daintily, and frisked joyously, MR.
CHIPPENDALE was the Old English Gentleman of 56 (I say, MR.
Robertson, that’s not so old, come), about to marry a young wife,
and who had persuaded himself that he was going to do a wise thing—
the actor had quite got hold of the nature of the old fool. He adopted
Quite a Parliamentary manner. I mean, of course, that he showed he
knew he was a humbug.
The audience stormed applause, and called author and performers.
That’s nothing, of course, in these days; but I applauded, and that is
a great deal. The comedy is a success.
O, º way, the author. Just so. But why shouldn’t I imitate
the fashion, dismiss with a couple of words the author, who has spent
weeks in conceiving all the situations, and polishing all the dialogue,
and devote myself to praising the performers, the scene-painters, the
çarpenters, the prompter, and the call-boy, SiR JAMES MACKINTosh
fashion . But I shan’t. I have been an author myself, and I tell
you we have really something to do with the success of a piece, though
you may, not think so. MR. Rob ERTSON has written ever so many
capital, plays; and this one, though not one of his strongest, is as
agreeable as any of them. I have to thank him for many pleasant
evenings, and Thursday's was one. I don’t know what he was saying
to himself when he went on the second time—probably remarkin
that he was glad to see EPICURUs Rotundus in the last stall, secon
w, P.S.
The Café de l'Europe is a most respectable and convenient chapel of
ease to the Haymarket Theatre, and, as has been proved before MR.
KNox, is the resort of very eminent characters. But I should be false
to my mission, if I said that my Seltzer water was sufficiently iced.
I have no doubt that it will be, next time.
Returning to my stall, I beheld the Frightful Hair. Somebody has
told me that its author contributes to your paper, therefore, of course,
I can say nothing about it, except that I laug led from the beginning
to a point at which duty to my family dictated my leaving off, but a
judicious friend kindly took up the laughing for me, and went on until
the fall of the curtain.
. There were a great many pretty women—I mean handsome ladies—
in the house. Italked to several, between the acts. I wonder whether
it is overleaping the barriers to say that two fair faces looked, and had
a right to look, radiant at the respective º of two husbands.
When I have added that a lady gave me two bonbons, I have com-
pleted my criticism, and I remain

IRELAND’S I)OUBLE GRIEWANCE,
MR. PUNCH,
Fiat justifia, ruat coelum, as LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE Cockburn,
when Recorder of Southampton, said to a barrister in the Sessions
House, who wanted the Court adjourned because the rain came in
through a hole in the roof, and wetted his wig. Be just and fear not.
Do justice to Ireland, for instance, in respect of the Irish Church
Establishment, regardless of consequences. - -
However, the consequences of doing Ireland justice in that particular
will probably be good. The excessive endowment of the Irish Church
is a substantial grievance. The redress of such a grievance will doubt-
less prove, in a measure, conciliatory. Your Irish property to its right
use; 'tis for the irish. "For a nation to have to pay for a clergy whom
it disowns is an injury as well as an insult.
Disendow and disestablish the Irish Church, however, say some who
nevertheless regard it as a sentimental grievance merely. If it were
no more than that, Mr. Punch, your friend GLADSTONE would do best
to leave it alone. He would not, by abolishing it, abate the grievance
of which it is merely one exemplification. That grievance is the Pro:
testantism of the United Kingdom. The Pope’s Irish subjects will
not cease to feel sentimentally aggrieved, whilst they are precluded
from the possibility of having a Popish Sovereign, and Lord Lieu-
tenant, or rather a Viceroy and a Subviceroy of the Pope’s, to reign
over them.
A sentimental
evance, regarded as an insult, is a sentimental
grievance, ...i. as an insult is an insult. A substantial grievance
may be great or small. you ever been kicked much, Sir, you
would know, and as it is you can conceive, that there is a difference, as
to a kick, between boots and boots. ... A kick hurts, or may hurt, more
or less, accordingly as one is kicked with a light or heavy boot, Whereas,
a horsewhip, flourished over one's head, does not, hurt at all, if one is
a philosopher; but, if it does hurt sentimentally, a little horsewhip
urts as much as a big one. Of course nobody but a fool will consider
himself horsewhipped when, he is only told to. Still less will he
insist on considering himself horsewhipped when he is entreated to
think no such thing; but you won't, persuade Ultramontane PADDY
that you have redressed his sentimental grievance whilst you maintain
the Act of Settlement. Of course that consideration will not prevent
you and GLADSTONE from dealing º on your friend Cock-
BURN’s, maxim with Ireland; only you will do it with your four eyes
open, like the hundred of your most vigilant humble servant, AR
GUS.
JOB AND A JOBATION.
WE have not the least idea what a meat salesman's man is, but he
must be a kind of JoB. We read in the City Press (a '. good paper,
by the way, and full of news about London, new and old) that the in-
dividual in question has been described, at a public meeting, as “ filthy;
depraved, gin-drinking, insolent, ignorant, licentious, and abandoned.’
Come, that is a nice derangement of epitaphs. , And the representative
of the class merely asks, meekly, “Why should this be said of us? It
is not true.” Primă facie, people who can meet such a shower of com-
liment with so mild a remonstrance, must be good * and worth
nowing, and we mean to take a lounge through the noble New
Market, and have a look at them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN APOLOGY FOR PLAYGOERS.
CRITIC has been animadvert-
ing on the British Public
for thronging to see sensa-
tion-plays, burlesques, and
pantomimes, in preference
to the ideal and rational
drama. This predilection is
º to
dulness and depraved taste,
On, reflection, however, it
will be seen to be really
owing to the high intellec-
tual and moral endowments
of the majority of playgoers.
Their daily life of business
consists in the laborious
exertion of , the higher
mental faculties, and the
arduous exercise of the
nobler sentiments. In their
hours of idleness they fly,
for the recreation of change,
to scenes and exhibitions
which afford a temporary
excitement to their sensu-
ous proclivities and animal
natures. . Suppose a man is
living in inactive luxury, or
is habitually engaged in
some frivolous avocation,
such, for example, as that
of writing levity, without
- - ever trying to make it the
vehicle of any truth which may be worth considering, it is all very well
for such a fellow, when he wants amusement, to go to one of SHAK-
SPEARE's plays, or an opera by MozART or BEETHoyEN, or an oratorio
§ HANDEL. His mind, whose lower powers are those which he em-
oys as a rule, is refreshed by the exceptional stimulation which it
erives from musical and dramatic performances of an elevating ten-
dency. Very maturally, therefore, this kind of man resorts to the
legitimate drama, or the lyric theatre, and frequents the Philharmonic
or the Monday Pops; whilst the multitude, accustomed to grayer
pursuits, repair, for that variety which is restorative as well as charming
to the temple of buffoonery and nonsense, and to the music-hall.
NAIRN AND LAPUTA.
THERE is some reason to suppose that the Public has not seen a
nuine copy of the answer returned by the Right Honourable the
REsident of THE BoARD OF TRADE to the letter sent him by MR.
ALEXANDER DREW, of Nairn, inviting him to encourage officially, by a
Royal bounty, a company to be formed for the º: of clearing the
seas of porpoises and bottle-nosed whales. . It will be clear to every
person of any discernment that the following transcript of the repl
which MR. DREw's suggestion was honoured withal, is stamped wi
authenticity:—
Sir, It is impossible for me to express, in suitable terms, the
opinion I entertain of your proposal that the Government in which I
have the honour to serve should grant }. aid to a commercial
association for ºterºlinating bottle-nosed whales and porpoises. But,
unfortunately, Her Majesty's Ministers have not at their disposal any
public money which they could devote to the furtherance of an enter-
prise even so practicable and promising as that which you propose. In
order to obtain the necessary funds, they would have to apply to
Parliament. I regret to, say that the House of Commons is not yet
sufficiently advanced to be likely to view, your project in any other

age. In short, I am afraid that were I to move in the House of

capture of those monsters of the .# the bottle-nosed and other
cetaceans whose enormities you so justly denounce, the only effect of
my motion would be that the House would vote forthwith my own

DEAR SIR WILLIAM,
PUNCH does like
true NAPIER impulse, whic
and ten times into grief.
You sent to the Times a letter from a Lady, who described what she
saw, and told what she had heard, during the late fighting in Malaga.
It was essentially, “a woman's letter,” and whether that phrase be
praise or censure depends upon whether the employer likes women or
not. Some people don’t like them. Punch adores them.
Then somebody told you that the Pall Mall Gazette had been rude
to the lady. And then came out the NAPIER characteristic which
Punch does admire so, you can’t think. , You scorn to get the Journal
and see whether the accusation be true, but you write a letter of mag-
nificent abuse, and add that you will never again expose a lady to suc
treatment., Probably, by this time, you have seen #. paper, and may
think that beyond the liberty of daring to make any remark on anything
which a NAPIER has endorsed, there was no great harm in what the
Critic said.
... Bless you, stick to this way of doing things. We (and others) find
it so convenient. When we a sensation story of some grievance
or wrong, we instantly *.* an indignant article upon it. For as
the story is nearly sure to a wild exaggeration, or an unfair state-
ment, we should be done out of our gush if we waited for the facts.

“At the Montgomeryshire quarter session at Welshpool last week a tramp

To laugh at a Welsh jury is as natural a thing as it used to be to

A GOOD WORD FOR A GOOD WORK.
PUNCH is clearly not the place for medical discussions. People who
read Punch wish to be enlightened, instructed, or amused, but do not
want to see a word which may shock their tender feelings. A descrip-
tion of a hospital is not the sort of article that one expects in Punc
any more than an account of a painful operation. Still, every now and
then, a word about a hospital is admissible in Punch, as is a charitable
word for any other work of charity.
The º Free Hospital is not more free than welcome as a
charitable helping-place to thousands of our poor. When it first was
started, not a hospital in London was ever freely open, as in charity all
should be, to such sick folk as the Royal Free was founded specially to
succour. In this really useful hospital, so long as there are funds un-
t, and sleeping wards unfilled, any poor sick persons may come to
them and fill them; and they need not lose their little strength by
hunting up subscribers to send them “Open Sesame,” in an admission
ticket.
Now, like most of us good people, the directors of this Hospital very
i. want money; for, like most of us good people, they don’t get
enough for the work they wish to do. See here what they say as
to what they have to do—
“It must not be forgotten that the present medical practice is to “build up'
patients, and the resulting increase in the consumption of food and stimulants,
coupled with #: prices, renders the item for food, wine, and spirits a ve
serious one. The arrangements of the dispensary are being remodelled wit
a view to greater economy, but when it is considered that we have frequently
to make up 3000 prescriptions in the course of one week, and that the cost of
one year's drugs alone (purchased under the most favourable circumstances
open to the Board) amounts to more than £1700, we need not point out how
great is the expenditure connected with the relief to out-patients. They
§§ ...; hospital, but must be turned away unless the public supply us
with funds.”
And see here what they say as to what they want to get—
“In no spirit of self-laudation, but merely to show that the managers are
not unmindful of their responsibilities, we may mention that within the last
year four members of the committee have between them contributed more than
£500 towards the hospital funds, but such efforts of course cannot be con-
tinuous. Our annual subscriptions do not much exceed £1400, and the total
amount received from donations and legacies during the current year is little
more than £4770.
“And, now, what is our position ? We have no property beyond the hos-
pital buildings, and some legacies payable on future contingencies. We owe
nearly £5600. We have a very slender balance at our bankers, and our
expenditure (irrespective of salaries) is more than £110 per week. What are
we to do * We have room in the wards for 200 beds, and we can only fill
about 70. We have beds and bedding, and are willing to work if the public
will help us; if not, we must close the hospital.”
Please to fork out, therefore, Gentlemen. , You surely would not
wish to see the Hospital shut up. Think what suffering is succoured
by a charity like this. Think that but, for Heaven's mercy, you your-
self, Q Croesus! might haply there become a supplicant. Remember,
there’s no shamming in the sick ward of a hospital, Shut your fists
against sham sick folk as close as you can clench; their gin-distilling
breath tells where your coin will go to... But be royally free-handed to
the Royal Free, and be sure that you do good with every shilling that
you give to it.

all events I shall be able to show you new species of the old genus,
and even the genera themselves, under novel aspects. I show them
all under one roof, and will point them out as they come and go,
hopping backwards and forwards. - - - -
*. 5. Old Cock. First Specimen—Often described by his friends
and acquaintances as a Rare Old Bird. He is apparently the essence
of hospitality. He is a widower without encumbrances, living an easy
bachelor life. His home, a compact snuggery, with all the appliances
of comfort and luxury within reach of his arm; and, for what is
beyond this distance, there is a butler attached to a bell, who will get
it for you, whatever or wherever it is. So excellent are this Jolly Old
Cock's dinners, that, strange to say, other birds are perpelually press-
ing him to come away from them and dine at their nests, where neither
food, drink, nor serving, are half so good as at the table of the Jolly
Öid cock himself. Yet he is not without at least four invitations for
every night in the week, including Sunday; and he, would be, really
welcome were he to “ drop in” on some families suddenly at , dinner-
§: only that he is much too old a bird to run such a fearful risk as
80.
Young Kock Robbins, who has recently gone on the Stock
Exchange, with a view to doing something somewhere (or, perhaps,
somebody), looks in upon me one morning about breakfast-time, and
complains of headache. , Kock RoBBINs even refuses the crumbs, he
is so poorly. Knowingly, I offer him soda-water, - -
“Yes,” he says: “I was dining with old BARNDoor last night.
Jolly old Cock—old BARNDoor. By Jingo! he has got wine, You
don't want to smoke when you get such wine as that.”
I observe that it's a great treat to get really fine wine.
“I should think sol” says Robbins, gulping down his soda-water.

“It was foolishly * one glass of Champagne at dinner that º

Wards.
Having relieved his mind on this score—(he tries to believe in his
own theory about the one glass of Champagne; but knows that he
can’t impose it upon others)—he reiterates his conviction that “Old
BARNDoor is the jolliest old Cock going. You must know him!” cries
Robbins to me, enthusiastically. “I’ll introduce you to him. He'll
be º: to see you at any time. Quite an accident my meeting him
yesterday as he was walking home from the City; he asked me to
dine without ceremony, and I was delighted at the chance.”
Little Kock Robbiss is, by the way, a bird who is always coming
in for crumbs. When first Kocky came to town, he was in want of a
dinner, and hopped about piteously until something was thrown to
Now, bless you, crumbs are spread out before him. He is a Pro-
essional Diner-out... Not that he is asked out for his beautiful notes,
or his brilliant chittering powers: no, he is simply asked, “to make
one.” Rob BINs is the small weight thrown in to adjust the dinner-
arty scales. Time was when little Kocky would have flown for a
#. from the Strand to Bayswater.
is really too far to go,” and he chooses the nearest out of three equally
good invitations. But wherever there is a dinner difficulty, Robbins
is called in.
The MACAws of Macaw (whose plumage made such a sensation some
seasons ago) expect a §§ to dinner.
On the morning of the day itself, MRs. MACAw receives an apology.
One can’t come. -
“Well,” says MR. MACAw, who is in his slippers examining the
Mining Journal, and is not fully alive to the difficulty.
“Well, my dear,” returns his wife, “we shall be thirteen /*
“Shall we ?” answers MR.MACAw, who has just ascertained that
}. ; his numerous speculations is looking up—“Well, it can’t be
elped.
..Thereupon MRs. MACAw demonstrates the utter impossibility of
sitting down thirteen to dinner, and presses (not for the first time, of
course) her superstition upon her husband so pertinaciously as to make
him feel a little uncomfortable about that codicil which #: has been
going to add to his will any day this last two years.
“You can ask some one at the Club, dear, can't you?” suggests
MRs. MACAw. Cunning woman; she knows that this, at most times,
would be a grateful, concession on her part; but, unfortunately he
can’t go near the Club to-day—in fact, must be in the City almost up
to the moment of returning to dress for dinner. This means that he
can't think of anyone at the Club, just now, whom he would be certain the bishops will loo
to find there, and he doesn't want to run the chance of a refusal. He
knows how men talk.
“Oh, send to MR. Robbins,” cries MRs. MACAw. “He’ll be glad
to come, I’m sure.”
“But at such short notice,” says her husband, with some sort of
regard for Robbins' feelings, who, he should think, would not always
like being asked merely at the last moment to make an even number.
MRs. MACAw poohpoohs Robbins' feelings. She knows he’ll be toº
delighted to come, and she rather prides herself upon having performed
a charitable action.
“I’m glad,” she says subsequently, “I thought of MR. Kock
Robbins. He hasn’t got much money, and it’s quite a kindness to
ask him out.” So this estimable lady spreads this account of poor
Robbins among her friends and acquaintances, and consequently
Robbins, for pity’s sake, is the gayest man I know. . He is, in fact,
a Professiona º He is less engaged in the Regular
Season than he is in the Off-Seasons; but at all times he has as much
as he can do, and in the Winter, especially, Kock Rob BINS comes out
in great force.

The meeting, indeed, was inclined to refuse to admit the duty of sub-
mission, and at first knocked out of a resolution words recognising
that duty; but ARCHDEACON DENISON, however tolerant of Ritualistic
nonsense, had too much respect for scholarship to sanction nonsense in
composition, and threatened to leave the chair if the sentence were not
completed. . So the duty was owned, but it was also declared that the
degree in which it was to be performed must be left to individual judg-
ment; that is, priests are to be ritualistic where they may, and to obey
the law where they must. And then they bound themselves to spread
to the utmost of their power the doctrine which they say can only be
properly taught by the aid of a yard of best wax. However, it is
something that they did not imitate the Scotch clergy, and leave the
Church for a reason of conscience. They were too much men of the
world for that. Now, we would not persecute, even with a smile, a
sincere fanatic, while he does no harm, but as many of these gentlemen are
clearly not sincere, and as they all do much harm, preaching that which
their vows º forbid them to preach, Punch continues to hope that
after them, or he will have to look after the bishops.

HINTS FOR CONVERSATION.
ConcLUDE you have

topic of all work

care not to know
whether the lady to
whom Mrs. Butt-
Ton Joyce, your
hostess, is intro-
ducing you, has
taken her ordinary
daily exercise since
luncheon. If you
long to distinguish
yourself in some
other arena than
the Theatres, the
Monday Popular
Concerts, the Balls
or Private Theatri-
cals in your respec-
tive suburbs, do
not scruple, if the
lady consigned to
"you is single, to
ask her at once
whether she is en-
gaged, and what
fortune she will have on marriage, whether she has any poor relations, whether
she dyes her hair or uses stimulants to her complexion, and what the amount of
her allowance is from Papa; not forgetting, if you observe the slightest indication
of a dawning pimple, to notice its intrusion with profuse regrets. If you have
charge of a married lady, begin by making a guess at her age, or picking holes
in her dress, or finding some flaw in her jewellery, adding a little light pleasantry
about the skilful arrangement of the millinery on her head to hide that dubious
place in the parting, until, when you see that your remarks are taken in good
part, you º secure enough to inquire how much the weekly housekeeping ex-
penses are, and whether she allows her servants fresh butter, and how often they
ive her warning, and whether her husband, whom you will not fail to point out
aughing and talking with pretty MRs. GAYLErgh Dashwood at the other end
of the table, is the same smiling amiable being in his own home, when tested by
* getting up late in the morning, by indifferent vegetables, and unexpected
lils.
Try this style of conversation when next you are dining or dancing out: if it
succeeds, you will go home a happier manthan you have felt for a long time, if it
fails, you can but fall back on your reserve of Robertson’s Plays and BURNAND’s
Burlesques; and the Ballet in the Pantomimes and the Ballot at Elections; and
the Election Petitions, which fill the papers to weariness, and the new halfpenn
paper, the Echo, (mind you quote what DIAMond DE WITT so neatly said, that it
is sure to pay, because Echo always answers); and The Ring and the Boºk, and
the Report of the Marriage Law Commission; and the Convention with America,
and Reverby Johnson, and the Alabama claims; and the Christy Minstrels:
and JoaçHTM's playings; and Dickens's Readings; and the new edition of

MR. SERGEANT PAYNE, celebrated no less for his admirable decisions and his
marvellous wisdom at the Clerkenwell Sessions than for his recitations of poetry
at second-rate tea-pot º that Roman Catholic priests should not
he paid for their prison-work, because two out of three criminals, professedly
Roman Catholics, would rather not see the priest. And, MR. PAYNE, perhaps two
out of three criminals would rather not see the policeman, or even your Worship:
or, to carry the argument somewhat further, they would rather that there were
not any moral law at all.
Is not a diseased man an idiot who will not call in the physician? How do
you deal with idiots? Would you not be lacking in your duty to a friend who
so acted, if you did not do all in your power to force medical advice upon him?
Were there a chance of his disease being contagious, would you listen to an
obstinate man who refuses the doctor's aid?
You would regret, MR. SERGEANT PAYNE, that you could not force the ministra.
tions ºf the physician upon your friend, and you would rather pay the ſee yourself
than allow a man to die of his disease, or linger out his days, a pest to society.
Your Irish Roman Catholic, or your English criminal of that faith, fears and
respects the priest; but he flatters º that he can blarney the Chaplain, for
whom he entertains no respect, nor of whom has he any fear.
You must admit the Priest: you need not pay him;
but MR. PUNCH, who recognises Catholic and Protestant
on an equality, as Ratepayers, tells you that you will
have to act fairly, you Board of Injustices, in spite of
yourselves.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CONFERENCE.
Foreign Office, Paris. Present, for France: MARQUIs DE LAVALETTE,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, President. For England: LORD Lyons.
For Russia: Count STAcKELBURG. For Austria : PRINCE MET-
TERNICH. For Prussia: Count DE SolMs. For Turkey: DJEMIL
PASHA. For Italy: M. NIGRA.
“This Conference was sadly borne.”—Benedick.
M. de Laralette. Pray be seated, Gentlemen. The cigarettes are in
that box, the cigars in this, and our friend the Pasha has his pipe.
Lord Lyons. The Pipe of Peace, we’ll hope. (Laughter.)
Pasha. That depends on yourselves, Gentlemen. Put that in your
pipes, and smoke it.
M. de Lavalette. Ha! haſ We begin pleasantly—a good omen.
Pasha. Inskallah /
Lord Lyons. But where is M. RANGAB}, our friend from Greece.
Will you not direct his admission, M. le Président *
Pasha. I have no objection to the son of a burnt father coming in
and sitting down. But he must have no vote.
Count Stackelburg. It is needless to say that my Government is
greatly displeased with Greece for agitating against the Sublime
°orte—
Pasha, Quite, (Winks.)
Count Stackelburg. But will Greece accept the proposed insult:
M. de Lavalette. You have reason to think she will not :
Count Stackelburg. I didn't say that.
M. de Lavalette. Well, we’ll see. (Rings.) Invite the Greek gen-
tleman to come in.
Enter M. RANGABé.
[All bow, ercept the PASHA, who grunts.
M. de Laralefſe. There, M. RANGABé, is your chair, and the Con-
ference will feel indebted to you for the valuable information (markedly)
with which you will favour them in reply to any inquiries that may be
addressed to you.
Pasha (aside). His face is blackened already. . .
M. Rangabé (perfly). Any information I may †. will be limited to
the informing the Conference which way I intend to vote.
M. de Laralette. I reply, Sir, with an intimation, on behalf of the
Conference, that such information will be needless, inasmuch as w
shall not trouble you to vote. -
M. Rangahé. Ah, two words to that bargain. -
Pasha. These sons of Sheitan are always thinking of bargains.
The Powers bought an unclean beast in a poke when they took up
Greece. May his grandmother's grave be defiled !
M. Rangabe. What is that Turk muttering P Gentlemen, I must
hear what my Government says to this outrageous proposal.
Pasha. His Government' A pack of brigands plotting in a back
Shop. -
M. de Laralette. You must see, M. RANGABE, that you cannot vote.
Your Government was no party to the Treaty of Paris. -
M. Rangabó. No ; nor to the Treaty of Utrecht, which has as much
to do with the question as the other. (Looks guardedly at the Count
StACKELBURG, who trinks at him to hold out.) In the name of the
Hellenic people, I protest against injustice, and I shall telegraph for
instructions.
M. de Lavalefſe. Then, M. DE RANGABAE, I reluctantly invite you to
take a cigar and your leave.
Pasha (aside). Fine tobacco is wasted on a fellow like that. A weed
at a sou is good enough for him, and he would prefer it.
M. de Rangalº. EUROPE SHALL REPENT THIs riff.
Count Stackelburg. I did myself the honour to hint to the Conference
what would happen. -

Count Stackelburg (laughing). On my honour I never said a word to
him about his conduct here.
Lord Lyons. Never mind—we can do just as well without him.
am sure that the Count is quite as well qualified as RANGABé to look
after the interests of Greece.
Pasha. Ha! ha! Very well spoken. By the Prophet, your face
shines like the sun, Lord of the Lions.
Count Stackellurg. My English friend and I understand one another.
Pasha. Yes, since Sebastopol. -
M. de Lavalette. Pray—pray—memories are, at times, brutalities.
Well, suppose we do something. Of course when I say do, I mean
say. We must spoil some paper besides what is round the cigarettes.
Will the representatives that have not yet spoken oblige us with some
conversation? Remember, we are bound to nothing that we agree
upon.
M. Nigra. I think the Musical Pitch is a much more interesting
subject than politics, and I hear, my Lord, that it is being agitated
again in #. Musical Europe decides that the Pitch must be
lowered before all the singers' voices are ruined.

thing mean as much like nothing as possible. My Government, of
course, can have no sympathy with a Power, large or small, which
seeks to aggrandise itself at the expense of a neighbour.
Count de Solms. There are neighbours and neighbours. Moreover,
though this is an inopportune moment for disturbing the peace of
Europe, which peace, º le Président, you and I know is so dear to
our Governments, there are questions affecting Greece which—
Pasha. I stand upon my ultimatum. If those questions are raised, I
can but retire to my hotel, where I hope to see you all at dinner at 8.
M. de Lapalette. We should be getting into business if we raised
questions. We are here to avoid business. But I think that if we
saw a way to recognise the justice of the Sublime Porte's ultimatum,
and such recognition were embodied in form, it might be for the
Sublime Porte to consider whether that would justify Turkey in with-
drawing the ultimatum, and expecting the submission of Greece.
Pasha. You had better let us lick her into submission. Beckesm—
on my eyes be it, we should make short work.
Lord Lyons. I have no doubt of the power and the valour of Turkey,
but I do not see that we can quite allow the work of 1S28–9 to be
undone by her,
Pasha. Well, by the Beard, I don’t care. Will you lick Greece for
us, if she does not mend her manners ?
Lord Lyons. As you well put it, Pasha," it is a case of manners, so
we must deal with it morally. The President’s suggestion seems
admirable.
Pasha. Inshallah, it will come to about the same thing. Compre-
hend, Gentlemen, that Turkey may be going to collapse, or not, that is
with Allah. But she is not going to be punctured by a Greek poniard.
If the sons of burnt fathers take your hints—well. If not, tº: will
have to take ours, which will be conveyed to them in the form of
bombshells. Make me happy, all of you, at S. |.
M. de Larale/fe. That is what you call, in London, plucky, my Lord.
Count Stackelburg. Especially as he knows that he will not be allowed
to fire a shot.
Iord Lyons. Then he has supernatural knowledge. Nobody else
knows that, Count STACKELBURG. England has a fleet in the Medi-
terranean, Count STAckelburg, and I do not believe that there is
anybody on board, from Admiral to powder-monkey, who knows that
Turkey would be interfered with, if, after all warnings, Greece persists.
Count Stackelburg. Let us hope that she will be better advised.
M. de Laralefſe. Some more tobacco, Gentlemen -
Lord Lyons. Well, I think not. Don’t give M.M. the journalists a
right to say that the Conference ended in smoke.
M. de Lacalette. My dear friend, when did journalists speak the
truth : - LEreunt.

WANTED AN ISLAND.
DEPUTY.CORONER RICHARDs the other day put the following question
to the husband of a she-drunkard, and then a Juror made a remark.
“Coros ER. Why did you give her the money to get drunk? In old times
when a husband found his wife getting drunk he locked her up in a room, and
fed her on bread and water until she got sober. In Scotland there is, it is
said, an island where drunken wives are landed, and all that they are left by
their husbands is a loaf of bread and a pitcher of cold water.
“A JUROR. If that island was near London, it would be thickly populated.”
May be so, MR. JUROR. But we thirst for geographical informa-
tiº. and hereby inquire of all Scottish friends (3,096,SOS at the last
census, but we imagine a baby or two may have been born since) where
º Sober Island is : What is its name : Is it Rum ? The state-

“The Law of the Land, by the Judges laid down,
And the will of the Clergy controlled by the Crown.”
Your Parson would fain culprits #. by the rule

“Church Courts for Church Causes?” ...Q Reverend Divine,

Of one who did seal with his blood that same cause *
As thine, the Church Courts set above the Realm's laws.
Art thou, too, prepared to encounter the fate

MR. REVERDY Johnson ran a terrible risk when he went the other
day to Luton, where they make miles and miles of straw plait; for,
suppose he had been “bonneted ”? In connection with this subject,
we should be glad to know what and where “The MILEs PLATTING
. ” is, at which MR. JACOB BRIGHT has lately been speaking on
eClucation.
AINSI SOIT-IL:
OR, as we believe the Freemasons say, “So mote it be.” But what
imports the nomination of those gentlemen, and why is reference made
to that mote in the brothers' eyes? This is why. Because we read
that before leaving Stockholm (which is the capital of Sweden) the
PRINCE OF WALEs was made a Knight of the Freemasons of CHARLEs
THE THIRTEENTH, after having successively received the six inferior
orders. Now the Oswestry Advertiser, in which Punch found this in-
formation, objects to the proceeding, because the Grand Lodge of
England recognises no six inferior orders, and holds the knightship of
CHARLES THE THIRTEENTH to be spurious Masonry. It further invites
the PRINCE OF WALEs, after he shall have shown to his Princess that
noble exploit of Freemasons, which is called the Pyramid, to come to
Wales, and be made into a right sort of Mason there, under the auspices
of Provincial Grand Master SIR WATKIN WILLIAMs WYNN, in Car-
narvon Castle. Further, it is *ś that the Prince do become the
Archmason of all, the Head of the craft, vice the EARL of ZETLAND,
who would be º to retire. To this latter arrangement Punch has
no objection, if his Prince have none, but Grand Master PUNCH pro-
tests against the Welsh business, nor does he propose to substitute a
ceremony in the Hall in the streetcalled after HENRIETTA MARIA. If the
Prince is to be made, it must be in no less noble a place than the Punch
Lodge, all the brothers of which are of the most profound and º:
learning in Masonry, and, proceed to refreshment in a way which is
more imposing than can be imagined by the profane. We will hold a
Lodge of Emergency whenever the Prince likes, and rattle him through
the degrees before he can smoke, a quarter of one of the unequalled
cigars that shall be presented to him. And instead of one secret, we
will impart to him at least a hundred. Moreover, he shall see a Cartoon
made, and other wonderful things. We take a base advantage of the
Oswestry Advertiser, which may not be much read, in Viº by for-
warding to the Prince an early proof of this invitation. But if H.R.H.
should prefer to say with CowPER—
“0 for a Lodge in some vast wilderness,”
we shall be happy to join him, our friend DR. Russell, and our friend
SIR SAMUEL BAKER at Cairo, and hold our Lodge in the desert, while
the Princess looks smiling down from the top of the Great Pyramid.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BIRDS, BEASTs, AND FISHEs.
Old Fellow abominates, he sends off, or goes himself to Kock Robins
as the head of the professional diners-out. Failing him and his kind,
he goes down the scale, and knows where to find those who will b:
cHAPTER THE SEcoSD-or MR. Kock RobbiNs, THE PROFESSIONAL ſºciolº glad tº come, and who think they are doing themselves a turn
cRUMBEATER, THE MACAws, JACK SPRATT, AND THE Jolly old (the simple, slybooters!) when in reality they are actually conferring a
COCK. (CoNTINUEd.)
THERE are some days when there is a perfect rush for Robbins. If
he were the last stall left on an old Jenny Lind night, he couldn't be in
greater demand. RobbiNs' presence would be bought, if it could, at
dinner, in hard cash—and handsomely paid for, too. What was once
undoubtedly a favour to Robbins, is now a favour ſº RobBINs to
his entertainers. Ten families, for instance, have all fixed the same
day for their dinner-parties, and every family, receives, on the very
same morning, one refusal from one guest. All, the parties are now
uneven numbers. At this crisis, what is to be done P Send for
Robbins. So the
--
tations by word of mouth, or by letter. But a call in proprid persond,
from host or hostess, if not too late, does the trick, and wins RoHRINs for
his, or her, table. This is the only way to catch him, while, like the
Cit in Bombastes, he is, “Pondering which to take and which refuse.”
Robbins has the power, you see, of making many people happy. For
it is a fearful cry that goes up from despairing matrons on such a
morning as that ği above, of which the burden is, “MR. Kock
RoBBINs; or, Thirteen at Dinner * I hare heard of a party of twelve
ultimately reduced to Kock RobBINs alone; that is, to him and his
host, for the º of the house had neither the face nor the heart to
meet her husband's guest, evº - -
decorate him with the blue Riband of the Almonds and Raisins. -
RobbiNs now thinks that he is in such request, on account of his
llant bearing, his polished manners, and his unexceptionable costume.
resuming upon this, he was very nearly being kicked out by an indig:
nant husband, but that affair has been hushed up, (in fact, I only heard
it from MAgg PyP, and took it for what it was worth, in the smoking-
room,) and little Kock Robbins is at the top of his profession. .
His card bears upon it simply “MR. Koçk RobbTNs,” with the
address, which you may be certain is central; for, like a doctor, he
must live where he can
trouble. - - -
I do not care who the professional man is, or to what profession
he belongs, he can’t afford to despise the humblest client.
If Kocky were to refuse my crumbs, as 1 hear he has done some
people's, at whose doorstep, he would, at one time, have timidly
scraped his boots, I shouldn’t let him have the chance of refusing a
second time, that's all. - - -
Kocky RobHINs is a privileged man. A professional dinner-eater is
not expected to gire, dinners, only to eat them. But, great as is
his immunity, the obligations of his state are heavy, and, sometimes,
oppressive. He is expected to eat of everything at table. He is ex:
pected to know his host's and hostess's taste, and should anything of
which they are fond be running short, he would forfeit their confidence
for ever, were he to take the last bit, just before it was being brought
(by particular direction given to the waiter) to the lady of the house.
He is even to suffer her to say sweetly, “I know you don’t care for
this,” as the supercilious Plush passes him over. It would be an act of
ingratitude, for instance, if RoHBINs, after dinner, backed up somebody’s
suggestion about another bottle of claret, or if he didn't meet such a
proposal by at once saying, “No more for me, thank you; I shan’t
touch a drop, I assure you.’ - - - -
RoBBINs is becoming, however, so well known that this last trick is
getting somewhat stale, and graceless fellows, who have no households
of their own, will inquire after RoBBINs appetite, and drinkatite, in a
way which would make any amateur in the art of dining out blush first,
...} throw decanters afterwards. Not so Robbins, he considers their
vulgar banter as a professional joke, and knows well enough that
they’ll pour in oil ºf wine on his wounds by asking him to a bachelor
dinner at the Club, where there’ll be the best salad, and with the bird,
the finest Burgundy that you can get anywhere in iondon.
KoçKY ROBBINs consequently is a great ally of Old BARNDoor's. As
Old BARNDoor ºf a Jolly Old Cock, gives dinners, he likes to have
always some one ready to whom to give 'em.
have heard that Acting Managers of Theatres know exactly
where to pounce down upon enough people sufficiently presentable to
make a fair show in his stalls, dress-circle, and private boxes, when the
business is horribly below par.
It, is a tradition, I believe, that there are rooms full of these people
of all sizes, looks, shapes and ages, always in evening dress, with cleaned
gloves from six till nine, sitting as mute as wax-works till the messenger
from the Theatre arrives to * they are wanted, and takes off so many
of them as suit his purpºse. should like to come suddenly into a
family of “Orders,” just before seven o'clock. At half-past nine (they
are never sent for later than this, and as a rule they needn't be in
waiting, after eight) they lay aside their festive costumes, not to be
resumed until six the next evening.
Well, the Jolly Qld Cock has dependents of this kind. Should it

favour on him.
“But, Jor bless you,” as Little JACK SPRATT, a very respectable
teacher of the piano, with, I fear, very few pupils except a protégée, I
believe, of Old BARNDoor's—as poor little Jack said to me, “we don’t
confernºbenefit on MR. BARNDoor, Lorno.” Jack Spratt calls BARN.
Doo; “Sir, and he and his wife, whose platter is clean and bare, are with
rotégée aforesaid, always, ready to dine with the Jolly Old Cock.
t would be as much as little SPRATT's professional existence is worth
to refuse; nay, both MRs, and MR. S. call to apologise for being out
when MR. B. came to ask them to come to dinner the other day. Old
BARNDoor was kind to them when there was a man in ossession, and
since that, SPRATT, or his wife, would lay down their lives for such a
generous noble-hearted man. JACK SPRATT has told me as much with
tears in his eyes, MRs. SPRATT had some objections to jack's giving
ymusic lessons to the protégée (a very pretty young lady, named Miss
GALENE,) and subsequently receiving . at the house. But the Jolly
Old Cock invited them to dinner, give Mis. Sº a bºilij gold
watch and chain, and arranged with them that they should be at no ex-
pense if they would take this young lady-in whom he professed a fatherly
interest, and whom he wished to see brought out as a pianiste, under
her husband's able instruction,--if she, Mrs. SpRAtt, would, he said,
take the young lady as a lodger, she should be at no loss, she might

So MRs. SPRATT (who was a clergyman's daughter, and one of six-
teen) saw at ºnce that there could be no harm in such an arrangement,
and severely blamed herself for allowing a shade of suspicion to cross
her mind concerning the conduct of such a kind, generous, good
creature as MR. BARNDoor.
The Jolly Qld Cock prefers his own table to anyone's.
“I like,” he says, jovially, “my friends to come to me. Let me en-

IS IT ONE P
A GENTLEMAN who has lost his seat in Parliament through bribery
by his agents declared in Court that he Never told a Lie in his Life.
..We have no doubt that he believed what he said, and that he is a

hen True Thomas was informed by the Queen of Faëry that she
meant to give him a tongue that could not lie, he vehemently remon-
strated against a present which he said would make him unfit for
lordlings feast and lady's bower.
What is a lie?
Is it One, when you are .# to tell the lady that you never
before saw any girl whom you could love, and that if she will wed you,
every hour, ºvery moment of your life shall be devoted to efforts to
make her happy?
Is it. One, when a worthy and kind-hearted utter bore calls upon
you, interrupting your work, or preventing your walk, to say that you
are glad to see him P
Is it One, when, you get two invitations, to choose, the pleasanter,
though you opened it after the other, and write to the sender of the
other that you regret that a previous engagement, &c. *
Is it One, when the author of a book which he has sent6. asks you
how you like it, to say that you think it is admirable. Or to say that
}. saw it was too good to read hastily, and that you are reserving it
or quiet perusal during your holiday? - -
Is it One, when you are being bored beyond bearing at a dinner-

to excuse your slipping away early -
Is it Qne, when a well meaning, but ignorant host asks you point-
blank whether that is not a fine glass of wine, to make him think you

cheque, to be returned on Tuesday, to be sorry that your balance is so
very low just now, &c.: -
Is it One to say something of the same kind when your wife, in the
course of a walk, shows a marked propensity for examining the
windows of silk-mercers or jewellers ?
Is it One when the Whip wants you particularly, and you can’t get
an answer about the Fº you want for a voter's son, to say that you
hope to be down for the division, but that you are afraid of bronchitis,
these disagreeable nights.
Is it One to misdirect a letter, so as to cause its delay, when you
particularly desire to stand well with your correspondent, and yet that
your answer shall be too late for his purpose -
Is it One to oblige an incompetent person with a testimonial to his
fitness for office, in terms that will ić. him, but which, if examined,
commit6. to nothing f
Is it One, when your friends are talking of their swell acquaintance,
to ask, in a casual way, whether anybody has heard of LoRD HYPHEN,
as you did not see him at LADY AstERisk’s on Saturday—the fact
being that you were not there, and don't know her or him?
Is it One, when A tells you that he knows you heard that sto
against him from B, to give him your solemn word of honour that
lºoke to you on the subject, the fact being that B wrote you the
story :
Is it One when a painter shows you a bad work, and demands your

BRUCE AND BISGROVE.
It seems barely conceivable that in a case where the Saturday
Review and the Pall Mall Gazette are on one side, and the Home
SECRETARY on the other, * should dare to express an opinion
that the Official is in the right, and his critics in the wrong. But Mr.
Punch must venture on this daring step, in the case of BRUCE v. BIs-
GROVE.
Here is the case as summed up by MR. BRUCE.
BIsgrove, a cobbler, had been drinking, but was not too drunk to
know what he was doing. -
In this state, at a late hour of the night, he comes upon a stranger
lying asleep in a field. -
A devilish desire (as he himself confesses) seizes him to kill this man.
From the bed of a neighbouring brook he picks a stone of 30 lbs.
weight, dashes it on the sleeper's head, and kills him.
e then lies down by the side of the murdered man, and is found
there quietly sleeping by those who discover the body.
* is proved he had never seen the man, and that he had not robbed
A strange case, surely, on the face of it, but there is no evidence
tendered at the trial to show that the murderer is in other than his
right mind. - -
The jury find him guilty, with another man who was found in the
ºutlood at the time, and the Judge passes sentence of death on
oth.
Bisgrove subsequently confesses the deed, and exonerates the man
who has been sentenced with him.
A clergyman who had been present at the trial, struck with the
* of the case, sets about inquiring into the prisoner's ante-
cedents.
He finds that he had been an illegitimate child, deserted by his
parents, and brought up by charity.
That he had become a collier, was quiet, inoffensive, and a general
favourite. -
That a few years ago, while, at work in a pit, he received a shock
from seeing a man killed close beside him by a fall of a stone from the
roof of the colliery. -
That, ever since, he had been subject to epileptic fits, which had led
to his being discharged by his employers.
That it was the general impression among his neighbours that these
fits had weakened his mind (as epileptic fits, after a time, usually do).
These facts were communicated to the Home SECRETARY.
He desired the Chief Constable of the county to go to the spot, and
carefully sift the evidence as to these facts.
The Chief Constable took the evidence of ten or twelve trustworthy
witnesses, which fully corroborated the clergyman's statement.
On this, MR. BRUCE commuted the sentence.
For this he was roundly taken to task by the Saturday Review and
the Pall Mall Gazette, before his explanation of the circumstances
under which he stayed the execution was made public.
Unexplained, the commutation was startling.
But as explained, it seems to Mr. Punch not only that the Hoy E
SECRETARY did his duty in commuting the sentence, but that the
method he took of satisfying himself as to the grounds for doing so
was sufficient, and, under the circumstances, not open to objection.
The Pall Mall would have found no fault with him “if he had sent
down a º of skill, and experience in diseases of the brain, had
ordered him to examine BISGRove personally, had laid before him the
evidence as to his past history carefully sifted, had received a report
from the doctor that BIsGROVE was certainly insane, had taken counsel
with the Judge who tried the case as to the weight to be attached to
this report, and had then, as the result of this investigation, given
orders for the prisoner's removal to a lunatic asylum.”
How does the Pall Mall know that MR. BRUCE did not consult with
the Judge who tried the case? We would venture to assume that he
did. If so, the head and front of MR. BRUCE's offending, even on the
Pall Mall's showing, is, that he substituted his own judgment and
the Chief Constable's for that of “the physician of skill and experience
in diseases of the brain.”
We should be glad to know the physician whose judgment in such a
matter is primd facie so much better than that of a Home Secretary of
long experience at the bar, and a Chief Constable, that the acting on
the one would have been altogether right, while the acting on the other
was “altogether wrong.”
The Pall Mall assumes, that the evidence collected by the Chief
Constable was not subjected to the test of cross-examination, was not
borne out by the º of impartial experts, did not, perhaps, even
clearly distinguish between the fits which were matters of fact and
the mental weakness which was matter of inference. Is not this
rather a large assumption.”
It strikes us that the Chief Constable was in all probability just as
capable of such cross-examination and distinction, and of taking
9pinions of impartial experts, as the “physician of skill and experience
in diseases of the brain,” would have been likely to be. Judging by
what Mr. Punch has seen of such physicians in the witness-box, he is
not inclined to rate their average judicial faculty, very highly; and
would in any case that concerned himself decidedly rather, trust the
iudgment of a Home Secretary and Chief Constable than that of any
W. ... he has ever watched under cross-examination. -
Nor can we see the marieté that so “astonishes” the Pall Mall, in
MR. BRUCE's adding, (as evidence that he has acted º in the
case,) that the Visiting Justices at Taunton had ordered a medical
inquiry; that the man had been pronounced insane; and that º,
tion had been made at the Home Office to have him removed to a
lunatic asylum. - -
What right has the Pall Mall to assume that either the Somerset-
shire justices, or the Somersetshire doctors have come to this conclu-
sion, as a matter of course, and merely or mainly because the Secretary
of State had come to it before them *
We really do not see what the latter have done to deserve the
Pall Mall’s sneer that they would have carried independence to an
absurd pitch, if they had refused to enable the Visiting Justices to
support what MR. BRUCE had done, not because it was just and right,
but because he had done it. -
Mr. Punch is glad to own to a better opinion of both Somersetshire
justices and Somersetshire doctors, and takes the liberty-pace, the
Tall Mall—to express his opinion that the HoME SECRETARY has done
his duty in this case, and has not laid himself open to fair animadver-
sion by the way in which he has done it.
IIYNCH HIA"EAAHN DIAOISIN ‘EAAHXIN.
My dear little Hellenes, pet no more rebellings:
Get up no more rows under auspices Russ: -
There’s a fable of which you should need no more tellings,
Touching certain hot chestnuts, a pug and a puss.
Already by dabbling in Eastern hot waters,
Your poor little fingers you’ve burnt to the bone.
Leave Russia in future to catch her own Tartars,
Fight shy of the CzAR, and let Turkey alone.
Need I tell you the tale how, when once dwarf and giant
Went to make joint-stock war on the world, the big gun
Thrust the small one in front, till the dwarf, too compliant,
Found that he dropp'd a limb every battle they won.
If the Great Eastern question so presses for oping,
Let those who will º by’t stand the expense.
Don't you play in the hand of an ally who's hoping
That you’ll take the kicks, while he pockets the pence.
Trust Bulgaria and Bosnia, Wallachia, Moldavia,
With their Suzerain Sultan to clear their own scores:
Let the Turk bind Crete over to better behaviour;
Leave Albania still Moslem, though close at your doors.
“Grande idée” though it be to make Hellas commander
Of all the Turk rules on this side Helle's sea,
There’s an idée I venture to call even grander-
Let Hellas make Hellas all Hellas should be.
Instead of declaiming about her old glories,
Lether kickdrones and demagogues both off her back:
Open roads, pay off debts, and give up telling stories,
Get rid of her brigands, her army bid pack: ..
Make her peasants secure of the fruits of their tillage; , ,
Find the right men and in the right place set them fast:
Keep her judges from bribes, her officials from pillage,
Turn her face to the future, her back to the past.
Till the star of her youth through her dark present flashes,
And the dead bones around stir and draw to its light;
And a nobler Byzantium arise from Time's ashes,
And Hellas's rule is the rule of the Right.
Then beneath her broad a gis the nations shall gather,
While the glories of old re-emblazon her name,
And the shades of her heroes exultingly father
The Hellas they now from Olympus disclaim.
A Saintly Garment.

That law kept its fangs and feelers

gave the verdict of hopeless lunacy.
TWO-LEGGED WERMIN.
ALL you who have ever been accustomed to recreate your minds and
bodies by rural rambles, are familiar with a certain exhibition of
natural history .# presented on the skirts of coppices. You
recollect the spectacle of sundry specimens of the i. Jauna, in a
state of more or less perfect preservation, affixed to the trees. Stoats
to wit, weasels, jays, magpies, carrion crows, owls, sparrowhawks and
kestrels ; the kestrels owing their position to certain outward belong-
ings which they share with the sparrowhawks, namely, a crooked bea
and talons. Now, your kestrel uses these appliances principally, and
almost entirely, for the purpose of catching and devouring mice an
insects; and it, at any rate, ought not to be found where you find it
gibbeted by stupid keepers, who, if they knew their craft, would leave
it alone to fly at large, and fan the wind over the fallows. The exter-
nal attributes of a hawk do not necessarily bespeak a member of the
dangerous feathered classes. Your honey-buzzard is as harmless as
your kestrel, destroying no creature of more consequence than a
dumbledore. Now, is it possible that what is thus true of the fal-
conidae, may be equally true of the human species P A useful bird may
be mistaken for a bird of prey; but can any reasonable doubt be en-
tertained as to the predatory character of the plumeless biped named
in the subjoined extract from the Post:—
“THE CoNTENTs of A Ticket-of-LEAve MAN's Pocket.—A man, named
JAMES GoLLAGHeR, ... º. at Hull on Tuesday and charged with
being a suspected person. He was remanded for further inquir: s for seven
days. In his pockets were found two pistols loaded and capped, a black mask,
several wax-tapers and knives, such as are used by oºr ars, matches, and
gunpowder.”
Few, probably, will question the individual, whose capture is an:
nounced as above, to a really pernicious member of the raptorial
order. Not many would hesitate to bet a round sum, that the result of
any inquiries which may have been j made was the discovery
that the possessor of the articles enumerated in the foregoing state-
ment is a character well known to the police, and most likely also to
the governors of a great variety of gaols, metropolitan and provincial.
What is to be done with such an obvious person of prey—such an un-
mistakeable instance of human vermin! What is he fit for but a place
equivalent to that assigned by the keeper to the local carnivora 2
Humanity, however, forbids the cheapest way of dealing with him. It
will be for the wisdom of an enlightened Ministry and a Reformed
Parliament to devise the most economical way of making society safe

them alive.
WELCOME TO A POET.
MR. PUNCH observes that MR. Robert BuchanaN, a poet of the
right sort, reads publicly in London. Ha! Sirs' We could well like
to hear him in his own bold talk between Silenus and Polypheme,
“That great sad Mountain, in whose depths doth roam
His small soul, wandering like a gentle lamb.”
Mr. Punch wishes him every success, and by way of pointing a
paragraph avowedly written to serve a gentleman for whom he has a
regard, adds that he has no doubt that MR. Bucha NAN speaks up, for
| ği as are his Undertones in print, they won't do on a platform.
Pauca Verba.
A NooDLE writes to ask Punch if there is any truth is the old saying
that “pigs see the wind,” and if so what wind is it they see. Pune
is not to be done. He has his reply ready. Why of course they can,
and the particular wind in question is a “Sow-wester.”
A JUDGE MADE FOR THE ACTION.
AWATCHMAKER has lately got damages for injuries arising from an
accident on a Railway platform: appropriately enough, the case was

BLACKHEATH AND THE BEGGARS.
BRAvo, Blackheath! What a blessing it would be if all the towns in England
were to follow its example, and set on foot a Men-and-women-dicity Society! This
is how all beggars are treated at Blackheath:—
“Tickets are supplied to every house in the neighbourhood; one of these is to be given
to the beggar in answer to his application. The ticket merely gives him the right to be
attended to by the society's officer, at the Alexandra Rooms, Blackheath, and has, therefore,
no marketable value.
“The officer listens to his tale; if he be resident in the neighbourhood, he will receive
a printed form, in which his statements are inserted, enclosed in an envelope, to the relieving
officer of his district. Very few of these letters will ever be delivered, the impostor weſi
knowing the reception which awaits him; and, being unable to procure anything but the
society's tickets in the whole of the neighbourhood, he will go elsewhere.
“The committee is quite ready to admit that there occasionally may be a Y. case.
In this instance the letter will reach the relieving officer. By him a form will be filled up,
stating what the guardians have been able to allow, and expressing his opinion if any
further assistance might be advantageously given. The applicant is thereupon referred
to the clergyman or minister near whom he resides; and the society hopes to be able to
forward a donation for his relief, to be applied through authorised local channels.”
If the beggar be deserving, he will be relieved; if he be an impostor, he will be
detected. How many beggars in a hundred are worthy to be helped, the bulletin
which is displayed at fjº every week may indicate:— -
“BLACKHEATH MENDICITY SocIETY.—Cases attended to—last week, 98; ditto last
month, 410. Professed mendicants and distressed labourers sent from the neighbourhood—
last week,69; ditto, last month, 241. Deserving cases—last week, 6; ditto last month, 20.” |d
Honest workmen out of work, and wanting to get home, have a railway ticket
given them to do so. Beggars who declare that they are absolutely starving get
a bit of bread, which they must eat in the presence of the officer, who gives it.
Worthy cases are endorsed by the parish authorities, and charity flows in abund-
antly to help them. But scamps are scared away, and tramps go tramping off
from the village of Blackheath, and on this account it surely may be called the
Happy Willage.

RETRENCHMENT: A SOLILOQUY.
(BY A SENTIMENTALIST IN THE CIVIL SERVICE.)
OLD fogies say, old stories show,
That fellows, fools though far above;
For †: half mad went years ago,
Fell, as they used to say, in lové.
So frantic as those fellows flew,
Never in these days you see men;
Some seniors this attribute to
Tobacco, which they smoked not then.
They melancholy got, and pale,
In various books, the fact we read;
Became indifferent to ale
Ånd actually off their feed
A state of mind one scarcely can
One’s self imagine being in;
Except, supposing that a man
Were terribly hard up for tin.
Yet when I look into the face
Of somebody that I could name;
It is undoubtedly the case
That something like a gentle flame
Communicated from her eyes,
A slight sensation does impart,
Which, if a fellow were unwise,
He might encourage in his heart.
Her smile such happiness beams through,
That, if she were a fellow's wife,
He fancies he’d be lº too
Being the partner of her ife.
But when he estimates her dress,
And counts the cost of being wed,
Of course this dream of happiness
He then dismisses from his head.
But now economy’s the cry
In public service; so it may
Become the fashion by-and-by
Likewise in the domestic way.
Impressions one might then allow
9 have upon him those effects,
Which prudence will not suffer, now,
Them to produce, if he reflects.
Once, on two hundred pounds a-year,
I’ve heard, a couple could commence;
Now it requires a thousand, clear—
So great is married life's expense.
Perhaps Retrenchment will recall
The cheaper times of which we’re told,
And fellows, if they choose, may fall
In love, and marry as of old.
THE ASTRONOMY OF THE STAGE.
STUDENTs of theatrical astronomy who are desirous of
learning all about the movements of the , Stars in the
dramatic firmament, should provide themselves forthwith
with MR..ANson's Almanack, wherein, abundant infor:
mation is furnished on such matters. Here º will find
recorded the times and places of the rising and the setting
of all the stars of any magnitude that have appeared since
wellnigh SHAKSPERE's time until the present. Here they
may learn the orbits of the planets who go starring in the
rovinces, and the positions of the fixed stars that prefer to
º in town; and they may find recorded very interesting
tales of many of the comets, or eccentric bodies, that from
time to time have blazed upon the stage. Here they will
learn when Harlequin, that “bright, particular star,” first
shone before the footli hts; and they will hear who first
discovered the constellation Pantomime, at which so many
º in the shape of opera-glasses, are nightly now
irected.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PERFECT CLERKS.
A Drama of a Government Office in 1870.
RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED TO MR. GREG.
Scene—A Government Office. TIME–Fifteen minutes before the hour
for attendance. But all the gentlemen have arrived, and all their
coats and hats are duly hung up. SEAson—Winter.
M Goody. This is a most excellent
plan, Gentlemen, this arriving
a quarter of an hour before the
time prescribed. It not only
insures the commencement of
the nation's business at the
proper moment, but it enables
us to enjoy that social converse
which would be improper
during the hours for which we
are paid.
Mr. De Coram. If I could
add anything to so delightful
a remark, it would be that we
are also able, in what I may
facetiously term an Economic
Parliament, to discuss any
little ideas that may have oc-
curred to us for the promotion
of the reforms desired by our
respected chiefs.
Mr. Docile. º said.
º Itake the libertyofasking
eac º present to a:
cept from me, (opens a small
#.” one of these Penwipers,
which I think will be found useful. Nothing tends to the conservation
of a pen so, much as carefully wiping it when done with, or in the
intervals of business. -
Mr. Goody. Speaking, I am sure, not only my own sentiments but
those of our friends here, I may say that we are much obliged to you,
DocILE. Your own handiwork, might we ask -
Mr. Docile. Well—yes—that is, with the assistance (blushes) of a fair
friend or two. -
Mr. Arch. Ah, DocTLE 1 (Lays his hand on his heart.)
Mr. De Coram. Nay, spare the banter. He said “or two.” We will
assume sisters" or shall we say cousins?
Mr. Docile. Not so; but aunts, who are deeply interested in our
little economic reforms, and favour me with many hints in that
direction. -
Mr. Amenable. I shall ever regret that I was not taught to write
with steel pens; but it is no affectation to say that I cannot dischar
the required amount of duty without quill pens: But I feel so strongly
that the nation ought not to lose by the inadvertence of my parents
(of whom, however, I would speak with all reverence), that I have cal-
&ulated the difference in cost between steel and quill, and it is my
intention to supply myself, at my own expense, with the latter, so far
as its cost is in excess of the former.
Mr. Goody. Our friend needs no praise but that of his conscience, or
I should say that I hardly know whether to admire most, his exact
habit or his sense of justice.
Mr. Amenable. Praise from MR. Goody is praise to be received with
out hesitation, and to be remembered without vanity.
Mr. Milde. I hear with regret that there has been cause for displea-
sure in the next room. ..I abstain from using names, but I am told
that a gentleman, having the misfortune to overturn his inkstand
(general shudder), was thoughtless enough, instead of wiping up the
ink with his coat, or his handkerchief, or some other article of his own, P
to use the national blotting-paper; (Sensation.)
Mr. Docile. The painful report had reached me, but I thought it best
to be silent, in the hope that there might be exaggeration. But I
deplore the fact that the case was even worse than our friend MR.
MILDE has forbearingly put it. The blotting-pad was a new one.
(Renewed sensation.)
Mr. Goody. I trust that the Heads will take a lenient course, but I
doubt whether they will consider it justifiable. Was it a first offence,
do you know, Docile *
Mr. Docile. Alas, no. The same misguided person had been already
admonished for cutting his nails with a national penknife.
Mr. Goody. Thus imperilling the edge; for the nail, unless saturated
with water, is exceedingly hard. Yet I can feel for the offender, for
(smiles) I had nearly been led astray in the same manner.
All. You !
Mr. Goody. Indeed, yes. For though, of course
my own, for use on such occasions, in a moment of
on the point—
I carry a knife of
abstraction I was
Mr. Arch. Of the knife P -
Mr. Goody. Ever, playful—but harmlessly so. . No, but of using the
wrong one. Providentially, I noted my mistake in time.
Mr. Prin. It has occurred to me, but, as a very {*.*. here,
I make the suggestion with diffidence, that did we all bring, slippers
with us, much wear and tear might be saved to the national carpet.
We could change our boots or shoes for them in the washing-room,
resuming the former at the close of business. - - -
Mr. Goody. The suggestion evinces so good a spirit that I hesitate
to damp it, but I may mention that the idea has been considered by the
Heads, and its adoption has not been recommended. I am without
information as to reasons, but as we are bound to believe the best (as
indeed it is a pleasure as well as a duty to do), we may assume that
gold feet, whence indisposition, and of course incapacity, may be feared
from the use of slippers. But pray, MR. PRIM, believe that your zeal
excites admiration in your colleagues. -
Mr. Gentle, Friday next, I observe from Men of the Time, is our own
Chief's birthday. , Do not think that I would suggest a testimonial of
the ordinary kind—he would dislike, if his kindness did not prevent
him from refusing it. But suppose we marked the occasion by tendering
him a document in which we should express our willingness to remain
at our desks for an additional hour? (Partial applause.) -
Mr. Goody. I think, my dear MR. GENTLE, you have the happiness of
being a bachelor, by which very imperfect expression I mean that you
have not the happiness of being a husband?
Mr. Gentle. I am indeed a solitary one.
Mr. Goody. Then I will, with all respect, ask you to reconsider that
§ of yours at a date when other than official influences have sway
with you.
Mr. Arch. There are circumstances over which some of us have no
control—some of those circumstances have bright º: and ready
tongues, and they consider that the nation has enough of our time.
Mr. Gentle. I am answered. -
Mr. Soſtroe. I could wish you, MR. Goody, to notice a trifling act of
duty. My private stock of note-paper was exhausted yesterday, and
it was necessary for me to write two notes in time to save post. I
wrote, of course, after four o'clock, but I borrowed two sheets from
the office. Ireplace them, adding a third, for Ithink that I tore one
sheet about two months ago. I am not certain, but it is well to be on
the safe side. - -
Mr. Goody (gravely). The restitution is honourably complete, but I
§ be allowed to remind you that London is full of accident, and that
anything happened to you between taking the nation's note-paper
and replacing it, your recovery might have been retarded by the
promptings of conscience.
Mr. Softroe. That thought came upon me, so strongly to-day, that I
nearly fell off the omnibus, and thus might have incurred the peril
against which you kindly warn, me. The matter shall not occur again.
Mr. Goody...So best... Our fire is but low this morning, and the
weather is chilly. I will ring and order a better blaze.
All. Not so, dear Sir.
Mr. Goody. No?
Mr. Docile. No. We have all brought our railway rugs, or other
. and with these over our legs, any present appeal to the national
coatskuttle will be needless.
Mr. Goody (visibly affected). Gentlemen, I am proud to be associated
with men of such devoted patriotism. You are all far above the petti-
ness of desiring plaudit, but it would be unfair to me, to yourselves,
and to the nation, if I did not say, MR. GREGsHALL HEAR OF THIS
[Clock strikes X., and the next instant all are hard at work.
A CURE FOR THE STREET ORGAN PLAGUE.
THANKs to the exertions of benevolent Mr. Punch, street organs
may be silenced now more easily than formerly. Still it is not always
leasant to rush out of one's study, and get a is thick stick, and strut
into the street, some half score of times, a day, to send away the
miscreants who get pennies from your neighbours for worrying your
life out. So we are very glad to see this scrap of news from Florence:–
“A Bill has been brought into the Italian Chamber to prevent the expor-
tation of boys for organ-grinding.”
What to do with our street criminals? This is one of the momen-
tous questions of the day. Well then, why, not “export” them, in
*. for the Italian organ-fiends * here 2 If Italy persists
in sending us street-brigands, who rob us of our comfort, to say
nothing of our coppers, why should we not retaliate b º her a
cargo of our scoundrelly garotters? A hint to this effect would surely
expedite the Bill to which we have alluded; and perhaps our Foreign
Ş. will be so good as to convey the hint by the next post to
"lorence.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EPICURUS AS GYMNAST.
oMFORTABLE PUNCH,-I have
been very much exercised b
MR. MACLAREN’s new boo
on Exercise. Youread every-
thing, so of course you have
read that book, and are aware
that it is a masterly exposi-
tion of a sound system of
physical education. It ap-
pears to me that anybody
who has any youths belong-
ing to him, or has the charge
of anybody...else's youths,
and who omits to study the
admirable preliminary cssay,
is morally responsible for the
consequences of neglect of
the invaluable rules laid
down by the Principal of the
Oxford Gymnasium. -
MR. MACLAREN makes it
so perfectly clear to me that
I am injuring one of , the
finest bodies and one of the noblest minds in the world, by not taking
sufficient exercise, that I feel it my imperative duty to write to you on
the subject. - -
Sir, I hate exercise, and the sight of MR.MACIAREN’s pictures, which

A LEAF FROM A FRIENCH PLAY.
Of course it never could occur to any English dramatist, that it
might be worth his while at sundry times to borrow an idea from the
French. But we really feel, inclined to wish that, just for this once, a
notion could be taken, and transplanted into England, from a play
which has been brought out at the Ambigu Comique. In a street-
scene, laid in Paris, this incident occurs :—
“A horse is seen on the stage vainly endeavouring to drag a load which is
too heavy for him. When he stops, exhausted, a brutal carter beats him
ferociously with the butt-end of the whip; a crowd collects; a generous
outrier remonstrates; carter threatens ouvrier; ouvrier knocks down carter;
tableau; situation; and tremendous cheering.”
In London, as in Paris, there are brutes who beat their beasts; and
in London, as in Paris, a lesson such as this might be given with
effect. Here too, “tremendous ... would probably arise when
the ruffian was floored; although an English audience is rarely so
intelligent as an audience in France. But we doubt if our Society for
Protecting Animals would act like their French brethren in the
manner here described:—
“At a recent meeting, the Société Protectrice des Animaux, recognising
the daring of the author in risking the fate of his piece for the sake of humane
ideas, “congratulates M. BARRIERE on his success, and thanks him for his
courage.’”
Fancy any English dramatist being ever thanked by any one for his
courage in attacking the vices of the day ! Fancy anyone in England
caring so much for the drama as to think it worth his while to go and
say a “thank you” to an author who had done the State some service
by his pen e fear that such a notion is one that never will be
“adapted from the French.” We should as soon expect to hear that,
in the interests of humanity, and as a trifling recognition of his civilising
influence, a Peerage and a pension were conferred on Mr. Punch.
HINTS FOR CONVERSATION.
START, selecting a pause, with something startling. Have they
heard—let your tone be deep and distinct—of the latest London terror,
one which will probably hasten the appointment of a new Commissioner
of Police, and may come before Parliament? No-for questions wi
follow fast and thick—you do not mean the beggars, or the garotters,
or the Directors, but you do mean that within a few minutes' walk
of a crowded thoroughfare, a police station, a fire-escape, a telegraph
office, and all the other conveniences of modern civilisation, in the
advanced life of the nineteenth century, contemporary with breech-
loaders, cartes-de-visite, perambulators, sewing-machines, and matches
that ignite only on the top of the head, HIGHWAYMEN have re-appeared,
and are at this moment (9:30 P.M.) following their calling and their
victims, not on the lonely heaths of Hounslow and Bagshot, not on
Wimbledon Common or Shooters' Hill, but here in very London, in the
centre of a densely-populated district, where night after night they
rifle pockets and lighten purses, unchecked by the police, who indeed
look on and laugh, loudly applauded by the spectators, and encouraged
by the approvaſof the public press. At this point in the narrative
raise your voice and drop your ºś. refer your excited hearers
not to the HoME SECRETARY, or SIRTHOMAS HENRY, but to Miss M.
OLIVER, who will introduce them, in her very best manner, to-Claude
du Val, “the Ladies' #. and his dexterous associates,

London telling everybody that the new piece, Claude's piece, went off
well, with its ammunition of good scenery, charming singing, grotesque
dancing, bright sayings, and one scene, “On the Tiles,” which, with
its burlesque sensations, ought to cram the house from floor to roof
for months to come. Talking of Claude du Val, you will be reminded
of the Claudes and all the other pictures, in the National Gallery,

it is hard upon a Party, in the singular, to be told that he is dead,

LEGAL ENTERTAINMENTS.
FROM time to time questions as to the legality of certain entertain:
ments arise which, after a vast deal of expense, time, labour, and
trouble, are disposed of with a certain amount of satisfaction to the
parties º and to the public in general. Entertainments then
are to be thus divided–Legal, illegal, undecided.
Setting aside entirely the last class, and of course refusing to have
anything to do with the second, a suggestion occurs to me, with regar
to the first, which would lead to the announcement of Legal Entertain-
ments for the People.
. But Legal Entertainments under a novel aspect, combining instruc-
tion with amusement. Permit me to explain.
The study of the Law is dry—let us moisten it. It is heavy—I
will lighten it. How By adopting the entertainer's plan, and in:

body else with a wig on.
. Instead of our Law Lectures at the Temple being heavy and unin-
viting, they would become most attractive, and many a youth, now
deterred, at the very commencement of his legal career, by the character
of the studies, would throw himself into them with an energy which
would soon hoist him on to the top of the first vacant jº
I will at once give an example of my meaning, and will then leave
the matter in the hands of those whom it chiefly concerns.
SCENE.-A Lecture Room, or Hall, in the Temple. On the Dais at the end
stands a piano and a table with two lamps on it. N.B. Evening
would be the fittest time—but this is for future consideration. Students
arranged facing the Dais. While they are assembling and inscrib-
ing their names in the attendance-book, a Pianist performs various
airs, e.g., “Law ci darem,” “The Jura Waltzes,” &c., &c.
Enter the Law Lecturer through a private door on to the Dais. Great
applause. He bows and commences.
Gentlement—I shall treat of various subjects in this evening's enter-
tainment, and I must ask the kind indulgence of my good friends in
front-if they will allow me to call them so (applause)—should I becom-
pelled by the disorder under which I still labour (coughs and dissembles;
applause)—to omit some of the imitations, recitations, and musical
ustrations, with which it has hitherto been my wont to enliven the
passing hour. In accordance, I say, with what I term my wont, the
present exception is far from being agreeable to my will.
[Laughter and applause. Lecturer siniles good-humouredly, coughs,
and continues.
You have, no doubt, Gentlemen, heard, or read of, or in some way
met with, the expression Corporeal Hereditaments. I will try and
convey to you some notion of its meaning, by .# what it doesn’t
mean. I will now appear, Gentlemen, as a Corporeal Hereditament.
[Lecturer disappears behind table. Music, “Scots wha whee.” Buzz
of expectation. Chord. Lecturer re-appears in large white wig,
green spectacles, false ruddy cheeks, and generally giving the
idea of a fat man. Great applause.

Corporeal Hereditaments. I say, don't. I recollect when your great

“Oh, yes, Sir, I have heard of Cor-
..+oreal Hereditaments.
Which it is a term of Law,

[Qf course this is only a sketchy outline, which any Lecturer can fill
up for himself. After the laughter has subsided, he will disappear
again, and reappear as himself.
Lecturer #: Having shown you what is and what is not a
Corporeal Hereditament, I will now explain how it is that neither Idiots,
Lunatics, nor Infants, are legally capable of making any binding dispo-
sition of any estate in them.
By “estate in them,” I do not mean that any of the above-mentioned
characters could have swallowed Hyde Park, or any other estate,
(laºghter), though the attempt would only go toº the man an idiot,
and, therefore, as I have said, incapacitated. I will now appear as a
Lunatic. Music : “ Hush / 'tis the
Lecturer (re-appears singing)–
I’ve seen him dancing in the Hall,
He cannot bind himself at all,” &c., &c.
[Great applause. He disappears and pops up again as the Infant,
then as the Idiot; finally in his own character.
Lecturer...So now you see Richard is himself again. (Applause.) We will
next consider the Mortmain Act. Some people think it necessary in
order to perform this, to have at least two bare-backed steeds and a
circus. Not so, I assure you.
Music. He goes through the Mortmain Act. Terrific applause.
The Second Part of the entertainment will consist of the story of
The Descent of an Estate in Fee Simple, when I shall have the honour of
assuming the following characters:—Susannah Brown and John Smith
(without issue), then Joseph Brown, the father of the Purchaser;
Bridget, his sister, from the country; Timothy, her half-brother, with a
song. The climax will be the Failure of the Heirs of the Purchaser,
and the sudden but triumphant appearance upon the scene of Harriet
Tibbs, who is entitled to the estate of her Maternal Grandmother and
Her Heirs after her (ifuch applause.)
The Third Part is very brief, and will consist of a series of beautiful
Dissolving Views, showing the practice of the Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes Court (applause), which will conclude with a dance of Rever-
sionary Interests and a military review of the Contingent Remainders.
And for the present, Gentlemen, there are ten minutes allowed for

CHAPTER THIRD.—THE JOLLY OLD COCK; A PARTY AT HIS HOUSE;
THE HENS, THE WRENS, AND THE SKYLARK; THE GOOSE AND
THE DUCK.
As a married couple the BARNDoors were not, I believe, singularly
happy, though he was as Jolly an Old Cock then as he is now, MRs.
BARNDooh was a quiet little woman, who tried to force asympathy with
her husband's jollity. She brought him a large fortune, which will, one of
these days, go to his son (the young Goose), with whom I do not think
the widower is on the best of terms. Goosey BARNDoor married the
dearest little Duck in the world, as poor as a church mouse ’tis true,
but every one thought that Qld BARNDoor was too Jolly an Old Cock
not to § them something handsome, and help 'em along.
The Jolly Qld Cock, however, talks of Goosey with the utmost kind-
ness, regrets his step, pardons him (over the wine), complains of his
conduct as a son towards him, a kind indulgent father, “who had spent
enormous sums upon that boy, Sir-are you taking Madeira or Port?—
and that boy, Sir, that ..". rascal, has repaid me by—but there I
won’t bother you with my affairs—your health. Now let me ring for
another bottle of that '20.” -
Of course such a good hospitable old Cock as this must have been in
the right, and his son consequently in the wrong.
Old BARNDoor's table groans under a profusion.
You are expected to take something of everything: you, as an inde-
pendent guest, needn’t-Kogk Robbins must—so must SPRATT, or
perish in the attempt. The Jolly Qld Cock wants to know, (though I
am only this instant introduced to him, and have been just invited.)
whether there is “anything I particularly fancy for dinner?” Of
course I leave it to him. . -
i. And,” says he, jovially, “I leave it to the Cook; haſ ha!
Whereat Kock Robbins, and SPRATT, and I, all laugh: SPRATT in
convulsions: he overdoes it.
At table the Jolly Old Cock is full of stories; and I never heard
stories obtain such a hearing, or such receptions as these,
The dependents know them, and can laugh in the right places, with-
out being off their feed. , SPRATT will point out #; or pun, to a
guest, or will repeat the story in part, with a note of admiration upon it;
To BARNDoor's house come singers, players, artists, and ladies and
gentlemen, Fº of the arts. Ladies love going to Mr. Barndoor’s,
. say. I have been astonished to see to what extent these Ducks
and Hens will flatter and smile, and laugh, behind their fans, at a
slightly naughty story from the jolly Old Cock, for the sake of gloves,
or scents, or an opera-box, or fashionable concert tickets, which are
sure to reward their attempts to fascinate. -
Goosey and the little }. are, never seen at such parties, and
no opera, boxes, or gifts, go to them. But then, we hear from the
Jolly Old Cock that “his dear boy Goosey is making a lot of money
at º, bar, and getting on capitally;” so, of course, he doesn't
Want, lt.
In fact, everyone says that Goosey has behaved badly, that though
there are two sides to every question, there is only one to this, and
that Old BARNDoor is the Jolliest Old Cock; while the ladies flatter
themselves that they can get anything out of him.
And how disgusted are MRs. WREN, and Miss WREN, and Miss
CooBIDDY, and several more, if any preference is shown by the Jolly
Old Cock to one pretty little_hen in particular—say, Miss AUGUSTA
DoRKING. The WRENs and CooBIDDIEs would peck her to pieces,
; dared, there and then, in the presence of the Jolly Old Cock him-
self, only they know better, and tolerate Miss DoRKING as being, un-
certain about the next holder of Qld BARNDoor's handkerchief.
Meanwhile, they, will peck her to pieces behind her back as they
drive home to-night.
“Upon my word,” says MRs. WREN, throwing herself back in the
double brougham, “it’s disgusting to see AUGUSTA DoRKING really
fauning on MR. BARNDoor.”
º § you see what a beautiful watch he jº. her on her birthday?”
cries Miss WREN, whose Papa has promised her a similar present “one
of these days.”

“Well,” says MRs. WREN, with asperity, “I hope no daughter of
mine ever fawm and grovel as that girl does.”
“Indeed not!” replies her daughter, wrapping herself more closely
up in her opera-cloak, and º to herself what she can do to
put AUGUsta DoRKING out of the field.
Old WREN (a direct descendant of SIR CHRISTOPHER's) feigns sleep,
and wonders to himself how women (including MRs. WREN) can be
such confounded humbugs. Then his thoughts return to Qld BARs.
pool; and he wishes that he could get the Jolly Qld Cock to “go
into” a rather extensive building speculation into which he has recen %
entered. An idea just crosses his mind that his womenkind might
somehow manage it for him; for he has a shrewd suspicion that the
Old Cock is not to be caught with salt sprinkled by a male hand on his
jolly old tail.
Miss SKYLARK, however, and not Miss WREN, is destined to over-
come La belle Doºking, for a time. Miss, SKYLARK has the piano, so
to speak, at her fingers' ends, and can warble deliciously.
“Will Miss AugustA sing?” asks the Jolly Old Cock.
She will not—so sorry—not brought any music.
A difficulty soon provided for. Miss SKYLARK has brought a
quantity, and, no doubt, there is some little piece among her collection
which Miss DoRKING can sing.
Miss DoRKING inspects the répertoire. There are several pieces she
knows by heart, but this fact_she keeps to herself, and pretends that
Miss SKYLARK has nothing there with which she is acquainted.
Miss SKYLARK suggests various songs, to which she will be delighted -

He does. He sits by her side. Delight of Augusta: consciousness
of future victory exhibited in the SKYLARK's eyes. Augusta's mother
sits herself down by Miss SKYLARK’s mother. Admirable tactics.
When Miss SKYLARK sings and plays, Augusta's mother will talk to
MRs. SKYLARK, and ask questions as to her daughter's musical ac-
quirements, her studies, her masters. Mrs. SKYLARK, don't you see

Tactics all in vain. La SKYWARR's voice rising above the chandelier,
piercing through the cunningly concealed ventilator, enters the bed-
room above, where the housemaid catches it and takes it down-stairs with
her for imitation. Old BARNDoor hushes AugustA, and will listen
to the SKYLARK. When she has finished, the Jolly Old Cock heartily
congratulates the young lady on her voice, the mother on having suc
a daughter, himself for knowing where to obtain such a pleasure, and
then praises her to AUGUSTA and AUGUSTA’s mother, who, of course,
perfectly agree with MR. BARNDoor, and would, were it not for the
pains and penalties attached, do her to death with hair-pins, or back
combs, or suspend her without her chignon, Absolom fashion, from
the highest branch in Hyde Park.
Tactics are necessary again. So they join Old BARNDoor in pressing
her to sing once more, in pressing her to sing once more after that,
and ever so many times after that. For are not the chances in favour
of ONE failure / But MAMMA SKYLARK's wing is at hand to shelter
her child. The carriage is at the door. The retreat is an admirably
contrived triumph.
“Oh, pray don't come down, MR. BARNDoor!” entreats the young
lady, º: the arm of the gallant host, who insists upon her taking
something, and being well wrapped up before he sees her into the
Carriage.
How sweet, how sympathetic, are the exchanges of “good nights”
among the ladies! How fullofa secret sub-understanding—with a sort of
Masonic significance—are the farewell nods and shakes of the husbands !
They all know what they’re going to hear as they drive home, and
will be prepared to recline, doze, and avoid conversation.
. So La SKYLARK flies home, and next day calls Old BARNDoor with
kind inquiries, a box for the theatre, a bouquet, gloves, scents, and an
invitation to his next dinner-party.
The other Sultanas nowhere.
Somehow, the Jolly Old Cock's caprices affect neither JACK SPRATT
nor his wife, nor the BARNDoor's artistic protégée, who, learning the art
of singing and playing in public, is domesticated at SPRATT's, and
makes one of an Fº very happy family. -
Coming out of the house, and crossing the road after lighting a
cigar, I stumble on a lady and, gentleman, not in evening dress, who

Here little Kock Robbins ioins me.
“Wasn't, it an excellent dinner, eh? First-rate,” he asks, taking
my arm with somewhat unnecessary hurry, and bringing me out of the
gaslight. “Pardon!’” says he. “I want you to come a little way off

A PUZZLING PERFORMANCE.
Of all bewildering advertisements, none perplex us more than those
relating to the Stage and to theatrical engagements. Here, for instance,
ls a specimen:—
ANTED, a WALKING SINGING LADY, stating her lowest
Terms.
A lady walking and singing and stating her lowest terms! What a
curious combination of simultaneous performances! What a queer
umble a songstress would make of any ballad, if, while singing it, she
ept on stating what her terms, were, and bargaining, about them!
Into some such stuff as this would a sentimental ballad be reduced by
such a process:–
I’M leaving thee in sorrow, ANNIE,
See the tear upon my cheek:
[Terms? You # find them less than many:
Only one pound ten per week.]
When I gaze upon thy photo,
With grief my brain goes whirling round;
[What? And wear my dresses low, too?
No, I could not say a pound !]

THA MUI "G RADH !
OUR dear friend PROFEssoR BLACKIE, whom Punch loves, and who
loves Punch, has been speaking as followeth, the occasion being the
anniversary of the birth of a Scottish poet of the name of Burns:-
“There was not a greater bore in the whole creation than an untravelled
Scot--he was generally a most bumptious, cantankerous, disagreeable crea-
ture, and required to go abroad and get rid of half of his Scotticism before he
could be admitted into good society.”
Then thus again :—
“He would not on any account, give a º on a Sunday, but it
seemed odd that people should not be allowed to play the piano on Sunday in
Scotland, or that a minister should be ...f wrong in going to the kirk
on Sunday with a rose in his coat button-hole... That, he believed, was a
piece of gross &nd º: superstition, which all Scotchmen would unlearn
as soon as they travelled abroad from the narrow triangle within which they
were born. Another remarkable characteristic of the untravelled Scot was
his immense sell-conceit—his high estimate of his own learning. But when
such a person went three months to Berlin, or some such place, he found his
notions curtailed—he began to feel that he knew almost nothing.”
The Professor, being a Scot, knoweth, and moreover, being a Scot,
may speak impune. Such is not Mr. Punch's experience of Scotsmen
whose weakness is that, thanks to the facilities afforded in Scotlan
for learning things, they know a deal too much to enjoy healthy non-
sense, that sovereign remedy for many evils. They don’t (habitually)
admire the Unfitness of Things, and he who doth not this is an incom-
plete party. For the rest Mr. Punch can, but express, in Northern
Scotch, his surprise at the Professor's boldness, and hath done so at
the top of this paragraph. I say! He would add, “Come, you know,”
only his Gaelic young man is gone out.
A Good Reasoner.
A TEEToTALLER's arguments are pretty sure to be sound, for he is
certain to make use of nothing which will not hold water.

THE BRIDES OF PARIS.
WHAT a pleasant thing it must be, for a man of moderate means, to be so lucky
as to fall over head and ears in love in the charming city of Paris!—at least, sup-
posing he be forced to marry in that capital, and furnish for his wedding-day some
trifle like the following:—
“A very interesting bride has entered married life in white satin and Alençon, for
which latter trimming (a flounce) the sum of 50,000 francs was paid by her happy husband.”
An agreeable rule of three sum is suggested by this anecdote. . If the flounce
of a girl's wedding-dress costs fifty thousand francs, how much is it likely that
the rest of it, will cost? A bride who spends two thousand pounds upon the
trimming of her flounce, would probably require a fifty pound bouquet and a
hundred guinea handkerchief. The other items in her toilette would be costly in
º and not the Koh-i-Noor itself would satisfy her wants in the matter
of her jewellery. Judging from the lace expended on her wedding-dress, it is diffi-
cult to guess what amount of yearly income would be needful for her pin-money;
but when one thinks of bonnets, gloves, shawls, parasols, and shoes, and other
little trifles, one would fancy that a husband had need to be a Croesus to support
a wife in Paris. -
To unsophisticated folks it jº seem well-nigh preposterous to talk of such a
thing as a hundred guinea handkerchief; but there is little, doubt such, articles
# be procured in Paris, or we should hardly find recorded there an incident like
this :-
“Another bride has had her pocket-handkerchiefs exhibited in a large store of the Rue
de la Paix. They amount to the small item of 80,000 francs.”
“Grande Exposition des , Mouchoirs de Mademoiselle Dépensière.” What a
pretty notice to put in a Paris newspaper! What a sight for a father! and for a
fiancé / Wº a ă. must be afflicted with chronic influenza, to require upon her
marriage eighty thousand francs' worth of bridal pocket-handkerchiefs! Even if
they cost her but a ten-pound note a-piece, she would for eighty thousand francs
obtain some six-and-twenty dozens of them. Whatever be the uses to which they may
be º: clearly hundred guinea handkerchiefs are not things
to be sneezed at. But imagine the expense of a bride's
entire trousseau, if above three thousand pounds be ex-
pended on her handkerchiefs! How many new bonnets
would be needful for her honeymoon, and what would be
her wants and wishes in the way of pearls and diamonds?
Well, Punch thanks goodness he is married, and so he
runs no risk now of having to fork out for a trousseau
à la Parisienne. In the judgment of Punch, no, such
foolish luxury ever can be needful to make a happy bride,
º: much it may be deemed so in the Judgment
of raris.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STARTLING EFFECT.
ONLY TO BE PRODUCED BY LONG HAIR PINs AND EQUESTRIAN
ExERCISE.
WHALLEY’S NEWS.
MR. PUNCH,
HAVE you heard of, or do you suspect, the existence of any
Secret Society, in connection with Exeter Hall, which is employing
agents to get fictitious paragraphs and passages inserted in Continental
apers, to the end that, being translated, they may excite and awaken
ritish fanaticism *
. For instance, Le Sport, in its sporting news, too, contains the follow-
ing announcement :-
“During the last year there were two thousand conversions to the Roman
Catholic faith in England.”
Hereupon a contemporary remarks, “Two to one there will be more
this year-taken.” It is all very well to make a joke of obvious fudge.
But are there not stolid Protestants by whom Le Sport, in publishin
the above-quoted statement, will be taken in earnest, as of course it
was meant to be by the parties who smuggled that statement into it
under the pretence of fun? I don’t say that they are connected
with Exeter Hall—but I suspect it, Sir.
Then, we have the Osservatore no, expatiating in a leader on
“Joyful events in the history of England 1’ namely, on the conver-
sion to Popery of the MARQUIs or BUTE, and the spread of Ritualism.
Protestantism has its Jesuits, and did not one of them write this
article, in the assumed character of perhaps a genuine disciple of
Loyola f Judge you from its conclusion :-
... “The joyful events, then, which have been, are being, and will be fulfilled
in England are the conversion of the Anglicans, and the return of that Island
of Saints, as it was formerly called, to the Catholic religion. Meanwhile we
have a gauge of this happy future in the frequent.conversions of so many
virtuous, learned, noble, and rich persons, not the least of which is the joyful
event of the conversion of the young MARQUIs of BUTE, which excites such a
noise now, and agitates so profoundly all the English.”
. Nobody with eyes, in his head can fail to see the drift of all this. It
is very cleverly calculated to frighten the British Public with the idea
that we are rapidly drifting into Popery. The Editor of the Unità
Gattolica was taken in. Some people cannot reflect. He did not see
that any controyertist who knew what he was talking of would know
better than to boast of conversions on the ground that the converts
were, not only many and virtuous, but, besides, many learned, *
nobić, and many rich. But his treacherous contributor knew we
what importance the common British, mind attaches, to nobility and
riches, as well as to learning. He knew how likely, it was to be
alarmed by the announcement that the wealth and intelligence of the
country were going over to Rome. He also knew that, as to learning,
it would never consider what was really the case, and ask itself what
learning had gone thither but that of mere scholars: how many men
accustomed to sift evidence and investigate truth : how many natural
philosophers: how many lawyers : whether any such fish had come to
the Fisherman's net as a PROFEssoR Owen, or TYNDALL, or HUXLEY,
or a LQRD CAIRNs. - - -
Finally, the Unità Cattolica asserts that the principal object of the
ARCHBishop of WesTMINstER's visit to Rome this winter is to execute
a mission intrusted to him by M.R.GLADSTONE; namely, to prepare the
way for a re-establishment of official diplomatic relations between the
British and Pontifical Governments. Now, if this assertion had been
found in the Record or the Rock, everybody would know what to think
of it. We should all, say it was a weak invention of MURPHY, or
WHALLEY., The Unità Cattolica, doubtless, publishes it in good faith,
but has evidently been hoaxed, ‘You must see that the thing is an
insidious canard, devised for a base p". by Protestant bigotry. It
is too bad, Sir, it is unworthy of Britons, it is mean, it is low,
to practise this kind of humbug on the simplicity of .#
Italian Ultramontanes. But the ridicule of educated Englishmen
defeat the endeavour to create an absurd i.p.: amongst the
vulgar that, in this land, of liberty, this land of enlightenment, this
land of political and intellectual progress, Popery is g ground.
But even if it were, what would that be to you, an GALLIO P

FROM ROME.
(From our Erclusive Correspondent. News warranted not to be
in any other Paper.)
THE Pope is very well. He has had several games of billiards lately
with CARDINAL ANTONELLI and the young MARQUIs of BUTE. .
I record some jeur de mots made by His Holiness and His Eminence
on the estimable young Convert's name. The Marquis made nine at
one stroke. - -
i Yº, play,” exclaimed ANTONELLI, in his best English, “BUTE-
The CARDINAL, at pool, held the Pope twice in the middle pocket.
His Holiness had only one life left; this the Marquis took.
“Et Tu BUTE!” cried his Holiness, in a tone of mock reproach
“ then I give up the game.” On second thoughts he starred two, an
Won.
: Italy is like you, Marquis,” said ANTONELLI, at supper. -
“Why?” asked the generous young nobleman, determined to give
his jocund Eminence a chance. ..
... Because,” returned the Cardinal, “It is a Boot, and so are you.
This answer threw a gloom over the party, which soon after broke
up. The Marquis has gone to Egypt, where he and MonsignoRECAPEL
(whose name some clever English papers have given as “Bishop
KEPPEL"—so well-informed are these Correspondents, forsooth !) will
probably join H.R.H. the DUKE of SUTHERLAND and EARL Russell
of the Times and Chelsea (in posse), with whom no doubt they will go
U; and down the River Nile,
n and out the Desert,
That’s the way the money goes—
And “pop goes the weasel” is the proper—or popper—finish, but it
won't come in. - -
There is a Reaction in Rome, but which way it goes, I don't know.
There are Reactions all over the place; it’s very puzzling. It only
wants two equal Reactions, to be going on at the same time for º;
to be perfectly quiet. Isn't that the doctrine of Mechanical forces
Rather. And as the Italians say, in one of their best proverbs," Mio.”
But I will send it you in full on hearing from you that you will under-
stand it in the original, as it will not bear either translation or the
sea-voyage.

Suicidal.
THE most ludicrously inconsistent, thing Punch has heard of for a
good while was the attempt of the Ritualists to get into the Committee
of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. What on
earth have they to do with Christian Knowledge? The more they keep
out of its way the better for them. We shall hear next of blackbeetles
insisting upon getting into scalding water.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HINTS FOR CONVERSATION.
S you my choose º; odd, something
out of the common way, for a beginning,
instead of º at length on the noto-
rious fact that the days are growing ;
ask everybody who is conversible, includ.
ing LoRD CLARENDON, if you can get hold of
him, whether they saw the advertisement in
which a Lecturer on “Women Doctors” an-
nounced that he would “exhibit a foreign body
six inches down his own throat,” and what
they thought of it...Or read aloud, with a proper
attention to elocution and stops, the following
tempting invitation:—
OARD and RESIDENCE for WORK.—An
old literary gentleman invites some lady, about
40, to assist him in doing without servants, except-
ing the best general servant that the highest rate of
wages can obtain and the kindest treatment can
secure...The lady must undertake entrées, soups,
and jellies. She must be too strong to feel the
slightest fatigue, as all the work of the house will
be mainly directed by her own taste to her own com-
fort. Company (at luncheon only) once a month. , Large.bed-room, private
sitting-room, †. free. The gentleman and lady dining together at
7 o’clock. References of mercantile exactness required. Address A. B., &c.,
stating age, and very full particulars of antecedent position, &c.
If you think it safer to stick to the ordinary necessaries of conversa-
tion, the weather will be all the fresher if you plunge at once into the
Gulf Stream, by which it is supposed to be unduly influenced and inti-
midated; and you will derive much quiet amusement, if, taking the
precaution first to read up all about this notorious old offender in the
usual standard works of reference, you probe your victims' knowledge
on the subject, and ask, just for information, what the Gulf Stream is
where the Gulf Stream is (venture as far as latitude and longitude), and
how it comes to pass that the Gulf Stream should have the power of
interfering with §. temperature and the consumption of coals in Bel-
gravia or Bloomsbury. , You, who have carefully pg. yourself for
examination, will be shocked at the ignorance of Society about this
one of the great Meteorological Powers, the wicked partner, as it may
be called, of the weather. - -
Do not forget what the fourteenth of this month.is. Just as
people want to know the connection of fº with Michaelmas, or,
at Christmas, cannot rest until they are told the meaning of mince-pies
and the origin of kissing under the mistletoe, so now you will find that
they seek information about Bishop VALENTINE and his family con-
nections and ecclesiastical preferment, and the tº in which he, a
great dignitary of the Church, came to be mixed up, with fancy
stationery, . the postman, and Hymen, and Cupid, and affec-
tionate couples and º; Always be prepared for these emer-
gencies. o, to your Notes and Queries, or your Hone, or your
Chambers, or the recesses of your own imagination, and have ready for
immediate use at the dinner-table or on the drawing-room ottoman,
just the sort of neat little obituary notice the papers would have put
in, if S. Valentine had lived and died in this country and century. A
few Post-office statistics as to the yearly increasing number of Valen;
times would not be amiss, with a calculation that if all those distributed
in the year 1868 could have been heaped one upon the other, they
would have exceeded in height, the Monument piled upon the Great
Pyramid, with the Duke of York’s Column thrown in. If you can add
a romantic little story of a youthful painter who had for more than six
weeks worshipped in secret a beautiful girl, with chestnut hair threaded
with gold, living with an aged aunt in the second floor front opposite
his studio, and at last e known his passion by a lovely Valentine,
his own design, in the flamboyant style, and was married to her after
some opposition on the part of her friends, and became prosperous, and
a Royal Academician, and his will quoted in the Illustrated
London News, you will not regret the result of your efforts to please.
Other topics suggest themselves, such as the enthronement of the
ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY, the Hull convent case, pricking Sheriffs
... and (can it be true?) floggi fiº; but the one which you will pro-
ºbably find most in vogue is the Loºp CHAMBERLAIN's Circular to the
Managers of the Theatres, and his laudable attempt at petticoat govern-
ment. Talk to MRs. DE Colºry on this subject. You will have no more
gloomy forebodings about the decay and decline of Old England, you
will forget your apprehensions that we are going the way of Ancient
Rome, and Assyria, and Babylon, and all those otherwicked kingdoms,
when you hear how warmly, how properly, she expresses herself con-
cerning the shockingly indelicate dresses worn by ladies—on the stage.
But say everywhere and to everybody that “a thorough good hissing,”
as one of the papers sensibly recommends, would be the most effectual
way of abating the shame.
THE CANINE FANCY.—Too often the calf of one's leg.
SEWAGE IRRIGATION A LA FRANCAISE, IN EGYPT.
THE PASHA of Egypt seems to be knitting himself by all his three
tails at once to the Péchés mignons of the West. ... He has granted a
concession to the administration of one of the Hells, which Berlin has
voted too hot for Homburg and Wiesbaden, to set the ball rolling and
spread the board of green cloth at Cairo. He has engaged Grande
uchesse SCHNEIDER, and, a. Parisian corps de ballet; has set his
Foreign Office clerks translating into Arabic the liveliest librettos of
OFFENBAGH and the spiciest of the Palais Royal vaudevilles, and has
gº the ladies of his harem private boxes to look on at their perform-
ance .
The man who has done this deserves to be called a Vice-roy in the
richest sense of the word.
The purveyors of opera-bouffe, ballet, roulette, and rouge-et-noir, at
least, will be able to disprove the old proverb, “er Nilo nil fit,” and
prove that a good deal is to be made out of the Nile.
Who says Egypt is not advancing, and that the tide of civilisation is
not even now beginning to flow into her bosom from France, viá Port
Said, through the Suez Canal?

A Call to Conversion.
WE hear a great deal about conversions such as that of the MARQUIs
OF BUTE, and in the meantime our Volunteers are armed with uncon-
yerted. Enfield rifles. If we were invaded by troops ºling with
breechloaders, what would become of our national defenders? MR.
CARDwell, pray have the Enfields, instantly converted to Sniders.
Let not conversion be delayed, until it is enforced by the wonders
wrought on our Volunteers by the Chassepôt rifle.
HOW SIMPLE.

in the right place, the King's name is discovered. They have found it

BIRDS, BEASTS, AND FISHEs.
CHAPTER FOURTH.—THE STORY OF THE Jolly old cock (Continued).
THE GOOSE HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH THE OLD BARNDOOR-KOCK
ROBBINS PICKS UP CHRISTMAS CRUMBS–AN OWL ACTS PROFES-
SIONALLY FOR THE GOOSE-THE GOOSE CONSORTS WITH A DOR-
MOUSE AND A PORCUPINE.
It seems that as I understand from little Kocky Robbins, Goosey
chose to run counter to Old BARNDOOR's wishes in every particular.
Goosex came of a wilful stock; he seems to have tried to please his
father, but all to no purpose. The Jolly Qld Cock brought up Goosey
expensively, with a view, to position, and making a connection. He
sent him to the University with the same idea. So far so good, and
Goosey went on the usual road. He proved himself not more of a
Goose than nine out of ten of his a quales; he came out of the first
examination an unplucked Goose, and being subsequently crammed and
fattened up for the Christmas examination for B.A. degree, he came
out of that well placed in the penultimate class, and had the privilege
of putting his head between the Vice Čhancellor's legs in order to be
told, in Latin, softly whispered in his ear by way of a secret, which
Ye wasn’t to tell anyone, that he was nothing more or less than a
13accalaureus Artium entitled to a hood, a pair of bands, two strings
to his gown, and to pay about forty pounds for these enviable dis-
tinctions.
The Jolly Old Cock knew that a degree was the period put to the
necessity for an undergraduate's residence at the University, and,
having been himself in business from the * of fifteen, he suddenly
announced to Goosey that he had obtained for him a situation in a
Banking House. Goosey did not realise the situation until he had
fairly entered upon his duties, and then, after .# counsel with some
friends, especially with DAwson DoRMouse, an old College chum, he
naturally set their advice on one side, and followed his own course.
Now his own course was diametrically opposed to the Jolly Old
Cock’s plan.
Goosey showed his father how unfitted he naturally was for business,
and how this unfitness had become positive incapacity under the train.
ing which Old BARNDoor had himself given him. Now of all days in
the year Goosey chose Christmas day, after Church time, as being best him
suited for his explanation. One reason for this was, that it was a holi-
day in the City, and another had something to do with the kindly tone
and charitable feeling which was, as it were, brought in by the recur-
rence of the Christian festival. But as you have seen, Goosey was a
Goose. So, when BARNDOOR heard his son's mild explanation, he grew
redder than, ever about, the gills, and swore that if his son didn’t do
what he wished, he would not give him a sixpence. This he confirmed
with an oath: in fact, being highly choleric and explosive, he sent him-
self to perdition, conditionally, more than once during the interview.
Goosey said he had tried and failed. It was hard for him at his age,
and after his education, to be doing a mere office-drudge's work.
Old BARNDoor, glowing before the fireplace, exclaimed, “Why, con-
found it, I was put at it when I was only fifteen. Yes, I had to work
for my daily bread”— this phrase was thrown in as a sort of pious
quotation suited to a father— and deuced glad I was to get it, I can
tell you. Your work! I was there from half-past eight till six, and
Old GRANNIT would have turned any one out who was a minute late.”
“But you were only fifteen, you say,” commences Goosey, about to
show that no parallel exists.
...Well, Sir, and you’re twenty-two,” Old BARNDoor retorts, sharply.
“What of that ? You’ve had a blanked fine education, which you
seem to forget you owe to me—to your father.”
“No, I don’t forget that,” shy; Goosey, “but—”
“But, but, º ut WHAT!” shouts his Jolly Qld Cock of a
father, and before Goosey can continue his answer, Old BARNDooH has
taken it up for him, sneeringly -- -
“But You are too proud; but You can't sit in an office; but You
can’t go the rounds on account day to the other houses; but You can’t
associate with clerks, because your father has made a É. of you;
more fool he to waste his money on such an ungrateful vagabond.”.
At this point, after a little #: swearing to himself, during which
Goosey was wishing he could adduce some new and telling ar ent
on his own side to justify the facts which he admitted, the Jolly Qld
Cock thrust both his hands into his pockets, turned on his heel abruptly,
walked to the window, and looking out into the street, it was winter
time, and looked very starved and cold, said, scowling, “There! I've
had enough of this. If you change your mind, well and good; if not—
don't come here again. Ah, how d'ye do? How are you?” This salu-
tation was given in the pleasantest tone possible to Kock RoBBINs,
who happened to pass at that moment. - - -
Kocky RoBBINs, not being allowed by his profession of dinner-
eating to be a family man, depends upon his patrons for his Christmas
udding. If his patrons fail him, he has to jollificate, by himself at
#. Club, if he is in funds, or in his own room on the landlady's beef
and pudding, which come up for him warmed after their first appearance
at the one o'clock dinner. Should there be no crumbs from even this
§: then RoBBINs is as festive as he can be all by himself, on tea,
uttered toast, marmalade, and an uncertain egg.
His patrons had failed him on this Christmas Day, and hence it
# that he was passing, slowly, very slowly, in front of the
Joly Qld Cock's house, where, he felt there was still a last chance of
an invitation.
So the ill wintry wind which blew sharply on Goosey’s face patted
RoRBINs on the back, at the same time and on the same doorstep.
The Jolly Qld Cock beckoned him in, as Goosey slowly put on his
coat and hat in the hall. -
...A Merry Christmas!” said Kocky, blithely, to the poor Goose.
. The Goose thanked him, and returned the compliment, as of no use
in his keeping.
“You'll just make, up our number,” exclaimed Old BARNDoor,
shaking RobbLNs’ hand heartily, and drawing him into the drawing:
room.
Then Goosey knew that he was not expected, and passed out by the
door which the servant was holding open for him.
}ld BARNDogB gave a magnificent dinner that night. Everyone
olitely asked after Goosey as their host's son, and everyone was per:
ectly satisfied with any answer. It was the Jolly Old Cock they’d
come to see, and his dinner they were going to eat, and they wished
him and themselves many such another happy Christmas in the same
place, and really meant it. And if there had been, which there wasn't,
sort of doubt as to BARNDoor's right and title to being parezcellence
a Jolly Old Cock, it would have been set at rest for ever on that jovial
Christmas night. -
To DAwson DoRMoUSE and others—who, whatever opinions they
held, as to the conduct of Qld BARNDoor, freely told his son that he
had behaved like an impolitic Goose—Goosey explained his father's
motives; but not until two years afterwards, when they had been ex-
plained to him by MR. Owl, the solicitor, to whom it fell to draw up
a deed, by which, for a certain annual consideration, Goosey made over
to Öld 3A spoon all claims upon such property as would of right be
his at the Jolly Old Cock's decease. - -
The protégée, who lodged at SPRATT's, had not a little to do with
the Joſy Öld Cock's conduct in this matter. -
Old BARNDoor found his son a nuisance, a check upon his pleasures,
an º when he had looked forward to his being no burden upon
al, all.
“But he can afford it?” I asked DoRMOUSE.
“Of course he can, and plenty over,” returned DoRMoUSE, slowly. .
...And the DoRMOUSE bestowed a variety of epithets, at intervals, as is
his way, upon Old BARNDooB, among which not the least strong were
miserly, cunning, selfish, wicked, cruel, debauched old scoundrel.
But this, after all, is only the opinion of DoRMoUSE, and perhaps one
or two others who are º to Goosey; but if you ask SPRATT, or
Kocky RoRBINs, or the WRENs, or the SKYLARKs, or, in fact, any one
who knows BARNDoor, his house, and dinners, they’ll all be unanimous
in iºns that “he is, without exception, the Jolliest Old Cock
possible.” - -
Being thrown upon the world the Goose found two friends in
DAwson DoRMoUSE and ToM PoncUPINE, who had lodgings together,
and were delighted to offer their spare room to the Goose. -
DAwson DoRMouse was at College with Goosey; and is, nominally,
very nomi , at the bar. ToM PoRCUPINE is (i.e. at the time of Goosey's
expulsion:-keeping myself in the present tense as accompanying
Goosey in his career) three or four tº. older than, his two friends.
He is in the precarious position of a sort of extra-clerk in a Govern-
ment office, put on for a special occasion when, there is work to be
done, and has “something to do with the papers,” and something less
to do, but equally mysterious, with a Publisher in the East End.
Two fellows more dissimilar, apparently, than the Dormouse and
the Porcupine, never chose to lodge in the same hole together.

BRILLIANT
IDEA
OF Young RARDUP DURING THE TRADESMEN's BILL SEAsoN.
AN ENGLISH-SPANISH FLY.
We entirely hold with the late KINg Epwamp THE
Second, that when men close for serious fighting, it is not
a time for courtesies.
“In battle day,” the King replied,
“Nice tourney rules are set aside.”
But is there any º
Star and the Englis
justify the Correspondent of the former in t
into the latter?—
“I believe the salary is £6000 a-year. Let the English who
come to this city, answer what help or courtesy they receive at
the hands of the Ambassador. As it is, one must go generally
twice, sometimes thrice, before one can even deliver one's cre-
dentials to the deputy, the principal being seldom visible, or
visible only for a few moments. e only place where one is
certain to find him is at the Museum, copying, with more, or
less success, one of the many masterpieces to be found in that
magnificent collection. The new Ministry might do a far worse
thing in diplomacy than recal SIR John CRAMPToN.”

into the water-butt and shut the lid down. If LoRD
CLARENDoN were to write a strong letter to SIR John
intimating that he must sometimes forget MURILLo an
attend to travelling cockneys, the remonstrance might have
its effect, as Mr. Punch has always heard that the Ambas-
sador is a gentleman. Besides, the best thing that an
Ambassador can do, is to do as fittie as possible; this is a
doctrine which we are sure that the Star will approve. At
all events we cannot approve the Spartan sternness which
proceeds to execution without giving the alleged offender
a chance of self justification or of reformation. The Star
Correspondent may be justly vexed with the Spaniards for
having returned a Monarchical Parliament instead of a
Cortes of Republicans, but he should not vent all his ill-
temper on SIR John CRAM PTON, or interpolate, in a com:
plaint, the feminine spitefulness of hinting that he is not
a good painter. The Star is usually so honourably dis-
tinguished by its avoidance of yulgarity that we have the
utmost pleasure in at length being able to hit a blot.
SYMPTOMS OF A COMING ROW.
ANYTHING for a Fight. Hooray! The Irish Protestant Defence
Association is up, and roaring like a young lion. An “enormous.
meeting has been held at the Rotunda, and Mr. GLADSTONE caught it
in a way that would make his friends very uncomfortable, if they did
not know that he had been already likened to everything from Anti-
christ down to BEALEs, both included. Quotations of the most terrific
character were hurled at him, one speaker not yery luckily likening
him to Achilles raging to slay Hector (Hector being, pro hdc vice,
the Irish Church) but PEELIDEs can bear, that. Another orator en-
couraged the Defenders of the Faith—Church we mean—with the
following touching sentiments:—
“Although we have—
“A struggling warfare, lingering long,
Thro' weary day and weary year—
A wild and many-weaponed throng
Hangs on our front and flank and rear.”
I would remind you that ARTHUR WELLEslEY, driven back behind the lines
of Torres Wedras, yet lived to see his victorious arms within the battlements of
Saint Sebastian, and his brave troops marching upon Paris. We must be
filled with such a determination ; we must be inspired with a like courage.
Yes, my friends, when I look at and consider our high and noble cause, I
would say—
y * Ne'er heed the shaft too surely cast,
The foul and hissing bolt of scorn,
For, with our side shall dwell at last,
The victory of endurance born' (applause).”
Applause ! We should think so. At the risk of tautology, we must
in remark Hooray! The wild and º throng, by
which is meant the Liberal majority, also likened to BonAPARTE's
Frenchmen, must shake in their Wellingtons and Bluchers. But one
remarkable lapse was made. MR. VERNER, M.P., to whom we are
indebted for the above splendid outburst, was shamefully abandoned,
at one moment, by his guardian angel, and was allowed to say:—
“We have our BRADy—a most valuable but scarcely reliable institution,
given to us by MR. GLADSTONE, AS HE onCE GAVE Us PEPPER.”
Well, we do not care to be prophetic, but if the Defenders go on in
this way it is just on the cards that MR.GLADSTONE may again favour
them with that pungent present. . Without *...* intruding on
domestic privacy, we may say that we happen to know that MR.
GLADSTQNE’s pepper-caster is by no means empty. Things have been
very dull this winter, but “the wild night-huntsman hath gone by,”
and we shall have a row. Finally, and for the third time, Hooray!
NEW THING IN RACES.
AFTER all, we shall be able to bear up should there be no Derby this
year. , Racing is becoming more comprehensive, as is proved by the
report of a velocipede race for twenty pounds. The horses of those
wh9 accompanied the competitors could not keep up with them. This
will probably "º. a new era in racing, and we shall shortly hear
of the Grand Wheelbarrow Stakes, the Perambulator Cup, and the
Iron-Hoop Handicap. Why not? It will improve the muscles, and
benefit the human race in a double sense. In the particular instance
uoted, a MR. WALosKI “trod”—that is the correct term, it seems—
the two miles in nine minutes and a half. This is a º idea; for
after all, why should betting scoundrels be the only “legs” who find
their condition improved by racing f
Logic and Lighthouse.
ON Wednesday night last week atelegram from Plymouth announced
that the rumour reporting the Eddystone Lighthouse to have been
destroyed was without foundation. So all thinking persons expected
to hear. . Of course, º were sure that the Lighthouse had a very
strong foundation, and they were not sure that the rumour of its
destruction had any.
“Holidays of the Church 1”, exclaimed an elderly gentleman,
who was perpetually being worried into “early services” and “high
celebrations,” by his Ritualistic daughters; “Don’t tell me of such
holidays—my festival and real day of rest is W.et-Sunday.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STAGE COPYISTS AND STAGE CRITICS.
E read in ARCH-
DEACON HARE's
Guesses at Truth
of a kind of men
who, coming near
a tree, never lift
up their eyes, but
go looking dili-
gently on the
ground till they
come on a dry
stick, and havin
found it, cry wit
aloud voice, “Eu-
reka! behold one
of the roots!”
From this order
of men, seems to have sprung a good many of the dramatic critics
now-a-days, incompetent or indisposed for the more useful duties
of their ºf the merits, analysing the purposes, gauging
the point, wit, humour, fancy, poetry, imagination of a play, or the
merits or shortcomings of the actors, they are large on the possible
sources whence the author may have borrowed his idea, incidents,
subject, story, or situations. If they can possibly refer anything in
the play to anything that has ever been presented on the stage before,
they insist on doing so, no matter how remote the resemblance, or how
improbable the “conveyance.”
his is a safe and easy game, and gratifies the smaller sentiments of
critical matures. It may sometimes be fair criticism; but in a great
many cases it is equally unfair and useless.
Ever since there has been a stage, dramatists have borrowed their
subjects and stories, and it was when they were most original that they
borrowed most freely and fearlessly. SHAKSPEARE was a reckless con-
veyancer. Look at the Italian novelists whom he drew upon without
scruple. See how he cut up North's Plutarch into cantles for his Julius
Cesar and Coriolanus, giving himself no more trouble than was required
for the slicing of North’s prose into ten-foot lengths. Think of the old
plays he was content—like a master-cobbler, as he was to vamp and
patch and polish, and sole and heel,-the earlier King Johns and Henry
the Sixths, and Timons of Athens, and—who knows-Hamlets, perhaps.
He had his critics of the time, one of whom pitched into him as “a crow
beautified with our feathers.” But before and after him, in all times
and all countries, play-writers, grave or gay, big or little, have put in
practice the right of taking their matter where they found it. TERENCE
robbed MENANDER, SENEga, Sophocles, and EURIFIDEs; Rorkou,
Corn EILLE and RACINE, SENECA and the Greeks; MoLIERE, REG-
NARD, and their followers, TERENCE, PLAUTUs, and the Spaniards;
WANBRUGH and Wyche RLY, MoLIERE; SHERIDAN, BUCKINGHAM an
WANBRUGH, And so stage conveyancing has gone on, in a round of
wrong, in all countries, from the earliest times to our own. . .
Boºcicaul'ſ and Mapoison Monron are not less original than
CoLMAN and KENNY, but the French sources which the elder play-
wrights drew from were not known to their public. The moderns do
not and cannot keep theirs a secret. Everybody reads the French
feuilletons; JEFF's shop is open to all; and the Magasin Théatrale
costs only sixpence a number. But, as a matter of fact, what are called
the good old English comedies and farces are, in six cases out of ten
at least, adaptations from the French.
Of course, the dramatist who invents story as well as dialogue and
characters deserves more credit than he who invents only one or two
of the three. But he who makes a character live and move and have
its being for reader or spectator, does more than he who ferrets out
from life or history.a subject not yet turned to stage account, or builds
up a plot out of his own invention; So does he who clothes his bor-
rowed skeleton of a story in the beauty of fervid passion, and high
thought, sweet and stately verse, consummate wit, or genial humour.
These are the qualities that show the master. The story is but the
peg to hang them upon. True, when the sole merit is in the story,
when all the interest is got out of surprise and suspense, or the shock
of a startling incident, as it often is in modern plays, he who borrows
the story, situation, or incident, borrows all. - -
display of character is nil, poetry absent, wit wanting, humour, point,
or grace of style dispensed with, for mere story, let us by all means
credit the inventor of the one quality of the piece with all its success.
But let the critics learn to distinguish between borrower and bor-
rower, between adaptation, and adaptation, between those who convey
to enrich, grace, embellish, and invest with new life, and those who
steal to deform, and defoul, stunt, and starve — those who bring
everything, and those who bring nothing to replace all that evaporates
in translation. - - -
Why should there not be a rule laid down that the word “original.”
shall be confined in the bills to pieces of which no originalin a dramatic
form already exists, and why should not the International Copyright
#. play of passion or
Bill be so modified that he who lays a foreign author's work under
contribution shall pay for it *
In the meantime Mr. Punch is not sorry that this question should
have been started, by the recent charge against MR. RoRERTson of
having borrowed the idea of his charming comedy, School, from BENE-
Dix's very inferior Aschenbrödel. For this may set people thinking
wherein lies the merit and demerit of stage-plays.
Would that lack of originality in plot and story were the worst fault
of our dramatic writing.
Undoubtedly, it cannot be said to be a good time for the theatre in
which coarse sensation, buffoonery, and bare ballet-girls usurp so much
room, and are so relied upon to draw.
But,there is a great deal, more to be said for our stage, even as it is
than the critics are in the habit of saying, just as there is a great deal
to be said against it that needs saying and is left unsaid. And this
applies to acting as of play-writing.
. Till we see sounder and honester, more impartial, and outspoken
judgment of both—the judgment of critics who º what is good and
relish it, yet can take into account the conditions of the time which
stand in the way of what is good—who have taste and culture, yet are
neither pedantic, bigoted, or impracticable, -and above all critics who
have no interests to serve but those of Art and the public,+Mr. Punch
is as little disposed to lend an ear as to look for good to the cuckoo
cry of originality, raised without distinction or discrimination, and
prompted far oftener } the ill-nature of a rival, or the jealousy of an
unsuccessful confrère, than by the outraged feelings of those who respect
§: and are anxious to see every man credited with all that
fairly belongs to him, and no more.
THE ENGLISHWOMAN’S DOMESTIC BROWNRIGG.
A SERIEs of vile letters has been published in a certain Magazine,
with the apparent object of outraging the feelings of simple people,
in order to gain notoriety by creating sensation. These communi-
cations might be described as a sort of Brownrigg Papers, with the
*::::. that they do not profess to advocate pushing MRs.
Row NRIGG's practices to murder, and that they affect to recommend
the perpetration of them, not by mistresses on apprentice girls, but by
mothers of families on their grown-up daughters of eighteen or twenty.
The writers of these foul, if feigned, articles enter into minute
details on the choice of instruments of torture, and on devices for
inflicting on young ladies a combination of “shame and pain.” Over
these some of them appear to gloat in such a way as almost to persuade
one that they are in earnest, and write under the influence of feelings
which have been engendered, or aggravated, in Ritualist confessionals.
For further particulars, see the Saturday Review of Jan. 30.
But, although all these odious letters in the Magazine may be mere
inventions, it is possible enough that they may produce the effect of
inflaming the morbid .# and malice of some depraved female, and
may so develop a maternal BRow NRIGG. In that case it is to be hoped
that MR. BRqwNRIGG, on first discovery, will let his wife know what
he thinks of her discipline by a vigorous application of it to her own
person, and teach her to inflict “shame and pain” on her daughter by
putting her to both herself. For this purpose, before all the family
and , the servants, following her own procedure, MR. BRow NRIgG
would but perform, an act of retributive justice } lashing MRs. B. with
a horsewhip to within an inch of her life. With a horse-whip? No;
with a dogwhip—the more appropriate scourge.
Conventual Tender Mercies.
THE Court of Queen's Bench has presented us with a pretty view of
a convent interior. Who says the disclosures are revolting : The
treatment which Sisters of Mercy are liable to be * to may
seem merciless. But doubtless it is founded on principe. Its object
is educational. “She had suffered persecution,” says STERNE, “and
;: mercy.” Sisters of Mercy are tormented to teach them their
uSlneSS.
Personal, Surely.

DEAR PUNCH
You will recognise my signature, probably, although I have
been so terribly screwed up of late that when I speak, I hardly know
myself from my next door neighbour. There is a great deal of nonsense
written about all my friends and relatives just now, and you, dear
Punch, can do us service by correcting some false impressions that
have gone abroad.
It was Costa who made me so much sharper than I was formerly;
therefore he alone is to blame if I am bold enough to say what I think.
It is absurd to accuse poor VERDI and other Composers of our rise,
How can any man write us a semitone higher or lower? You could
not, if you tried. Yet an authority, who has, I suppose, confused har:
mony with tuning, attributes to VERDI and others our present elevated
osition. He suppose; because VERDI extended the compass of the
aritone, and wrote Tenor music for him, that therefore he wrote
higher, as truly he did, but not, sharper. The trap was a good one,
and the wise man fell into it. The same critic talks about the police
not interfering with us, and complains that the “Teutonic Directors
take their own line as to the pitch fork.” If they do, he ought to
follow their example, and take to farming.
Some people sneer at MR. SIMs REEyes, and at all the efforts he is
making to restore us to our proper positions. They say MR. REEves
has been singing “under º for the last twenty years—clearly a
gross error; for though MR. REEVEs may be sometimes not up to
scratch, he was always up to and never under anything else in music.
My near relative A has been cited as being too highly favoured by
MR. REEves.. I have often heard the note brought out by our great
Expositor, but never oftener than HANDEL (who knew us when we
were differently situated) would have wished. The particular note is
employed by our old Master no less than eleven times in “Sound an
Alarm,” twice in “Thou shalt break them,” and twice in “The Enemy
said.” I can only remark that I wish I were A instead of what I am,
and that HANDEL could hear me when MR. REEVEs deigned to give
me out—shouldn't I be proud 1
But the object of my writing to you at all was not to expose the
olly of anybody so much as to explain that we unfortunates, who
belong to §. only harmonious scale in Nature, have been hardly used by
Costa. Ever since he came into power he has insisted upon pulling us
up higher and higher, to make his band sound more brilliantly, until at
last we are not only out of our element, but out of the good graces of
all good singers, young and old, whose voices, we are seriously
damaging. e don't mind giving ourselves airs, in fact it is our duty
to do so, but we strongly object to the high jinks we have been made
to play for the last quarter of a century.

AN
|NSULTED BIRD.
he Poet of Paradiº Lost and Il
Pensieroso, my dear Mr. Punch,
says of the nightingale:–
“Sweet bird, that shunnest the
noise of folly,
Most musical, most melan-
choly!”
Addicted as I am to soaring,
I hope I do not fly too high in
saying that MILTON might have
sung nearly the same about
me. Nearly, observe, not quite.
Although #. it that shouldn't,
I am most musical, but alto-
gether the reverse of most
melancholy; on the contrary,
universally accounted most
merry. Hence, my name has
come to be abused in a shame-
ful manner; of which I now
complain to you. . It is made
to signify a sort of merry-
making which is about the
most despicable and brutal
foolery that I look down upon
from the sky. You saw in the Pall Mall Gazette, the other day, that
two young snobs were committed for tearing down the fittings o a first-
class carriage, and throwing the footwarmer out of window., They
pleaded that this damage was only done for a purpose to which they
gave my name. I object to such a vile misapplication ºf it. Drunken
idiots usually make the same excuse for wrenching off door-knockers
and bell-handles. Even in common discourse it is customary to use
my name as a synonym of the word, equally vulgar and disgusting with
the outbreak which it signifies, called a "spree” by Champagne (harlie
and the gents. I do protest against the misnomer of ºly In IS-
chievous frolic, of which the character is always essentially low,

SCOUNDRELISM ON THE SEA,
PERHAPs no plummet that shall be cast will ever find the bottom of
uman baseness and wickedness. We have sometimes thought that
we had nearly sounded them, as in the case of the first Napoleon, or the
last hag sent to penal servitude for stripping children of their clothes.
But up crops a new case, which seems to demand a heavier lead and a
longer line than do either of the criminals we have mentioned. At
first we know not whether to thank MR. JAMES GREENWQOD, Qr nºt,
for making the revelation, so disgusting is, the cold brutality he
records; but, on reflection, we th him for having added another to
his good deeds. What think you, brothers and sisters, who lie safely
listening to the furious tempests, and who find some comfort, when
ou are pitying the sailors, in the thought that they are furnished with
ife-buoys, that may hold them up in the fight with the black waves,
what think you, we say, of this?
“Writing to me,” says MR. GREENwooD, in last Friday's Star, “con-
cerning loss of life at sea, MR. Dixon, a well-known life-belt and buoy maker
of Sunderland, informed me that he had grave suspicions of the quality of the
life-buoys manufactured in London, and supplied to the Jew slop shops. . He
jº met with life-buoys composed of the basest materials, and sent me
some bits of common rush as a sample of the interior of one he had dissected.
He further apprised me of the fact that to such an extent had this fraud been
perpetrated, }. a very large number of seamen would have nothing to do
j. life-buoys, declaring that they would rather go down and have done
with it, than hang in the jaws of death for a few hours, with the certainty of
drowning after all, becoming more apparent as the treacherous support gradu-
ally soddened, and sank under their weight.”
There, just read that quietly. * case for tall lan e. The
simple words are pretty nearly § “: Au think?...You have
taken in the fact. The men struggling in the waters, thinking of
firesides and children, and feeling the article from the Jew’s slop
shop giving way under their cold hands. Let us go on, then. .
R. GREENwood, naturally, did not care to receive this story without
inquiry. He is no Gusher, eager to gush before a tale can be contra-
dicted. On the contrary, a hard-headed, practical gentleman. He went
to Shadwell, and found a belt and buoy maker. The man was frank
enough :—
“He informed me that the buoys which are all stamped “warranted cork-
wood,' are nothing of the kind; ‘not one in a dozen.’ ‘You couldn't do it
for the money,” said my informant; ‘the Jews that such as we work for won't
give more than three-and-six or four shillings each for 'em, and how much
cork can you afford to stuff into 'em for that, I’d like to know º' . . . He
appeared to think that it did not matter what the canvas covers were stuffed
with so long as they were well sewn and painted. I further inquired as to
where the precious goods of his manufacture might be bought, and he replied
shortly, “Anywhere.' And it seemed that this was perfectly true.”
He told MR. GREEN wood what was put into the articles—rushes,
. But this will be shown better in MR. GREENwooD's own
account, :-
“The neighbourhoods of Shadwell, Ratcliff, and Poplar were visited, and at
each place at a seaman's slop-shop a “good life buoy” was inquired for and
bought. One was branded “warranted corkwood,' one ‘all cork,' and the third
simply bore the word warranted. They ranged in price from six shillings to
seven-and-sixpence. They were all three carried home, and dissected with the
following results:—
“No. 1 (“warranted corkwood’), when its flimsy yellow skin was slit, was
discovered to consist bodily of straw, sparely covered with cork shavings for
the satisfaction, it is presumed, of any cautious mariner who might feel dis-
º: to risk a like slit in his purchase so as to make sure of its quality before
e paid for it.
“No. 2 (“warranted') was stuffed with rushes.
“No. 3 (“all cork’), cork chips and rushes, about twenty per cent. of the
former and eighty of the latter.
“To test the buoyant capability of the three detected impostors they were
º in water, a weight of ten pounds being attached to each. This was the
result:—
“‘Warranted corkwood :' sank in an hour.
“‘Warranted:' stood the test for nearly two hours, and then succumbed.
“‘All cork,' floated for four hours, and then sank from view.”
We really do not see that we can do better than leave the case as
thus succinctly stated. . We thought, that no form of rascality could
surprise us much; but this revelation has more nearly produced
astonishment than *::: of which we have read for years. Yet
why be astonished P. For, “buthiness is buthiness,” as the Jew slop-
shop keeper would say; and “business is business,” as his Christian
rival would remark. But, but—would it not be pleasant to fling a gang
of the vendors of these accursed things into the sea off Brighton pier
Oil a º day, and pitch them a choice assortment of their own
buoys and belts to save them? We doubt whether a purer pleasure
could be suggested to us, unless we could hand them to the unfriendly
Maories about dinner time. We may not have either happiness; but
we may call upon all our contemporaries to do their best to spread the
knowledge that such are among the devilish tricks of trade; and we
may among us save a good many poor fellows from the deep. Can't
the Sailors' Home, among other channels, send about the facts?
And if Jack inquires into the matter, and, lººr. a buoy at a
slop shop, finds straw or shavings, we hope that he will not be so hard
as to pull the Jew’s nose off—that is, not quite off.
CUTTING IT FINE.
THE Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office has issued a
Circular to the public offices, urging greater economy in the consump-
tion of quill pens, which, judgin rom MR. GREG's cutting remarks,
appear to be very wº used between ten and four. As this is a
question of pounds, shillings, and pens, the nation having to stump up
a large sum every year for the supply of these quills, the Controller is
no doubt right in making a pounce upon what seems a decided abuse.
But, perhaps, a still, more necessary reform would be effected, if the
consumption of another article in constant use in Government offices
could be lessened—Red Tape.
Nice Police News from Wigan.
THE other day at Wigan a publican and collier were tried for brutally
assaulting aH. iceman who had called at the house of the former after
midnight. He knocked him down, kicked him, and, says the local
report, “tried to hold him over a fire—a performance in which they
succeeded for a short time.” The publican was fined ten pounds: the
accomplice half. Policemen are evidently not very highly valued at
Wigan. There is a touch of professional, originality in the collier's
putting the policeman on the coals. Possibly they had been bitten by
the ºtomime in which the guardians of the peace are generally
roasted.
A Box of Smoke.
A SEA-CAPTAIN has been fined, at Liverpool, for smuggling over
tobacco in a missionary box. As such things are about the size of
cigar-boxes, the poor man’s offence could not have been very large.
%. didn't he plead that the tobacco was some piqus and anonymous
contribution to the society to which the box belonged If “VIGILANs”
and other Argus-eyed writers say truth, many missionary contributions
are dissipated in much less sensible ways than the smoking them.

A SPANISH BULL.
At the opening of the Spanish Constituent Cortes MARSHAL SER-

announcement that:—
“The inaugural address was received with great enthusiasm, and at its
conclusion shouts were raised of “Long live the Nation l’ “Long live the
National Sovereignty.” “Long live the Provisional Government!’”
How little the shouting part of mankind are accustomed to consider
the Nºi; of their vociferations, it is amusing to see. “Long live
the Nation!” is a reasonable cry, and there is consistency in “Long
live the National Sovereignty;” but the Cortes convoked to settle
a permanent Constitution, evinced a rather unthinking enthusiasm
when they shouted “Long live the Provisional Government!”

“Honour to women, to whom it is given,
To make men sigh to escape to heaven,”
or to that, or another effect. But the gem was the finish...“I thank
you, Prime Warden, for this homage to those who are the Wardens of
our Hearts.” The worst is that one can’t use this again, as Wardens
are not often met. But if ever we meet one at a wedding-breakfast,
and we propose the bridesmaids, we see our way to something about
making them Church-wardens of our hearts. Church—don't you see—

A CIVIL MAIDSERVANT'S QUESTION.
THE other night, at a meeting of the National Association for the
Promotion of Social Science, a philogynist read a paper, and a con-
versation ensued, on the employment of women in the Civil Service-
which the Government are about to reduce. The argument of the
paper, however, and the general "g. of the meeting were in favour
of opening the overmanned Civil Service to women. The utility of so
doing may appear less obvious than the equity; but the idea, at least,
suggests an inquiry perhaps of some importance as a woman's question.
There is one particular in which women will naturally like to know
whether, if eligible, for the Civil Service, they will be subject to, the
same condition as that which generally regulates the Domestic—“No
Followers Allowed”?

A LITTLE PLEA FOR LARGE APPETITES.
People who have suffered from a plethora of turkeys, and who, with
all their frolicking and feasting this last Christmas, may have found it
hard some days to get an appetite for dinner, are likely to forget that
hunger really is a most unpleasant feeling, and becomes indeed distress-
ing when carried to excess. To a gourmand who is daily gorged with a
good dinner, hunger may appear a sensation, to be ºft. for; and
envy, more than Fº may be the inward feeling with which he may
regard a child half starving in the streets. A boy stuffed to repletion
with plum-pudding and mincepie may awaken, his compassion in a far
higher degree than the little hungry urchins who crowd about the pie-
shops, and flatten their small noses against the dirty glass.
ut we are not all gourmands, and Christmas feasts are over, and we
most of us know what it is to have a healthy appetite after a day's
work. So we most of us can feel real º for the little ones, with
whom appetites are far more plentiful than dinners, and whose limbs
are lean and stunted by paucity of food. But something, more than
pity it is in our power to give, and how to give that something usefully
may be learnt from this :—
“Last year the Committee of the Refuges for Homeless and Destitute
Children commenced, in December, a system of providing 500 children with a
good dinner weekly. These dinners were regularly given during the months
of December, January, and Fº last, the whole number of dinners pro-
vided having been 6,682, at a total cost of £196 1s. 7d., or at a very small
fraction beyond the sum of 7d. per dinner.”
Sevenpence per dinner and here are hundreds of us Christians
dining pretty often at some three guineas a-head ' . At one, meal we
consume the cost of giving dinners to above a hundred children, who
need a dinner far more than we do ourselves. If you have any doubt
on this point, listen to what follows:–
“It is impossible to calculate the value of these meals to those who ate
them, but it may be safely estimated that this one good meal in seven days
has saved many a little child from fever, lung disease, or some other m
such as would be almost certain to attack the little frame wasted and weakened
by a lack of nutriment. Many of these little ones are the children of very
--- ---
poor parents. Their fathers have probably, no regular employment: and when
work fails, food, as a matter of course, fails also. “You are not as quick as
usual,” says the teacher of the ragged school. “Teacher, I have had no
breakfast, and I feel very weak,’ is the reply.”
Starving often leads to stealing, and a good dinner once a week may
save a child from growing to a ruffianly thief. Think of this, please
you, whose selfishness is really the mainspring of your charity; and
reflect that the more dinners you subscribe for in the Refuges, the less
likelihood there is that you will be garotted by some hunger-bred
street-ruffian a dozen years, say, hence.
BROTHERLY, BUT A BORE.
WE read in the Pall Mall Gazette-
“The inspectors of weights and measures for St. Pancras have again in-
flicted penalties on a large number of tradesmen for having defective weights
and measures. Amongst others they have fined a vestryman 10s., but accord-
ing to the system adopted by the vestry under the local Act of Parliament the
names of the vestryman and other tradesmen who have been fined are kept
strictly secret.”
Punch considers this latter course rather noble and brotherly on the
part of the Westrymen. Each is willing to bear his share in the dis-
grace. But it is also rather a bore for i. ublic, who have to procure
a list of the Pancras Westry, and carefully abstain from buying anything
at the shop of any vestryman who sells by weight or measure.
To Authors and Managers.
We wish to suggest a suitable name for the first new Burlesque on
Pantomime that shall be brought out with decent dresses. Let it be a
pastoral Watteauesque piece, and let it be called, out of compliment to

TERRESTRIAL ANGELS’ TEARS.
You are all aware of the saying that the French capital is the place
of final beatitude reserved for all good Americans. Even to its native
inhabitants Paris, fashionable Paris, seems to be very nearly Paradise.
Very nearly; not quite. In Paradise there is no crying, of the lachry-
|. kind, at least. But in Paris, says the Post's Correspondent,
there :-
“The Skating Club people have not recovered from their disappointment at
the sudden break-up of the frost. It is a source of positive . to
some ladies who had ordered icing costumes. I called to-day on a family, and
found Madame in her drawing-room, gazing sadly on a pair of beautifull
engraved skates and lovely Polish boots. “Why so melancholy?” said I.
“Adieu patins!” she exclaimed, and burst into a flood of tears!”
Only think how happy, in general, this lady must have been to be
capable of * over the skates to which the mildness of the season
obliged her to bid farewell! What surroundings, what memories, what
prospect could leave her tears for the despair of exhibiting her agility
in ornamental skates and boots? From four to five, or even six meals
a day, and nearly as many changes of dress in the height, of fashion,
are doubtless her portion in this vale of tears, of which vale Paris is a
part, even to her. To all these blessings, house, servants, º to
match, and all the other good things of wealthy life, lots of ready
money inclusive, may be º: to be added; and Paris, no doubt,
contains legions of equally blessed beings, in respect of their blessed.
ness almost angels. Yet very probably, like herself, they all cry at
times, because something prevents them from showing themselves off
in some special finery, or for some other disappointment or calamity
not more heartbreaking...Therefore even to them, Paris is something
short of Paradise—even their own Paradisaical part of it is. For there
are other parts of Paris, where dwell les misérables. If the beautiful
superior beings of that city could º know, and think, what the
wretched classes have to cry for, they themselves would never cry at
being merely precluded from wearing º: and fancy clothes.
Paris would then become for them as nearly as possible the place with
which it is identified in the imagination of good Americans. Almost,
if not quite, all tears would be wiped away from their eyes, had they
any notion of the sorrows of those others.
A Sound JUDGE.-A Musical Critic.
VERY SERIOUS DANCING.
A short time ago someone ventured to .# est the idea of Ritualist
quadrilles. The following statement, in a published letter from Paris,
announces an advance far beyond that in the cultus of Terpsichore:–
“An Italian composer has published some dance-music under the title of
“The Seven Cardinal Sins!'. This is a new idea, and may even sell bad
music. Here is the original title:—‘Lest Sept Péchés Capitaux, Danses
Caractéristiques, ‘ L'Orgueil,' schottisch; “L’Avarice,' polka-mazurka; “La
Luxure, valse; “La Colère,' galop; “La Gourmandise,’ quadrille; ‘L'En-
vie,' polka; ‘La Paresse,’ mazurka.”
Hereon observes the letter-writer:—
“Dance-music is often F. in the churches of Italy. Why should not
divinity come to the aid of music?”
The divinity that came to the aid of the composer of such dance-
music as that abovenamed can hardly be conceived to bear any relation
to the divinity which “doth º a king.” It may be rather imagined
akin to the divinity apostrophised by Iago, Dance-music really charac:
teristic of the Seven Cardinal Sins would be music to which one might
fancy fools dancing down an inclined plane, on the “primrose path,” a
“facilis descensus,” down the middle, and not up again.
But perhaps the Cardinal Sin-dances, in spite of the present state of
Parisian society, are not really characteristic. Possibly mone of them
are illustrations of wickedness, such as might be, and sometimes, if not
usually, are, presented to the public in the modern ballet. It may be
that pride, avarice, luxury, and so on, as the titles of polkas and waltzes,
no more imply immorality than Sebastopol, Magenta, and Solferino, in
the same connection, do carnage. For aught anybody knows, they
express nothing worse than the condition of mind from which words
that mean the most solemn things are commonly employed, by some
composers, in the nomenclature of dance-music—idiotic frivolity.
Conundrum.
WHY oughtn't a Boot and Shoemaker to be trusted?
Because he’s a Slippery Customer.
WHAT MANAGERs, ACTRESSEs, AND SPECTATORS ALL WANT-A
good Dressing.

BIRDS, BEAST's, AND FISHEs.
CHAPTER FIFTH –THE STORY OF THE JOLLY OLD COCK, THE GOOSE,
AND THE LITTLE DUCK, INTERRUPTED BY A DORMOUSE AND A
BAT—THE DORMOUSE AT HOME-HIS HABITS – HIS PROFESSION
– HE LECTURES ON CHAMBER PRACTICE, AND GIVES THE,
GOOSE SOME EXCELLENT ADVICE.
DAwson DoRMoUs E is the sleepiest fellow I ever met. I don't
know what he was as a boy, but at college, where Goosey made his
…intance, his somnolent habits were proverbial.
o one, with any experience of DoRMoUSE, ever thought of asking
him to breakfast at nine. Such an invitation has often received from a
Night Bird the answer, “My dear fellow, I don't sit up so late,” but
DoRMouse hadn't this excuse; in fact, he had no ercuse, but would
accept the offer of hospitality with the proviso, “If I don't oversleep
myself,” which was tantamount to informing his host that he either
wouldn’t come at all; or, if he did come, would not make his appearance
till mid-day.
He has always been the same ; as he was, so he is, and in all proba-
bility will be to the end. DoRMoUSE is not a man who lives fast; he
does not, for instance, agree with those Sad Dogs who assert that
“not going home until daylight doth appear” is a necessary condition
of conviviality. On the contrary, DoRMoUs E will dine with a party
determined to make a night of it; will join them in that determination;
will drink toasts, will take his share in sustaining the conversation,
will help himself and pass the bottle, will smoke, will, in short, not be 1
behind any one there in promoting the pleasure of the evening; but,
about hal pº eleven, some one will ºilº, exclaim, L
“Hulio where’s for Mouse?”
Two or three, wags will, instantly look under the table, where,
perhaps, they will be in another two hours, and, not finding him there,
will discover, on further inquiry, that he had left abºut three-quarters
of an hour ago. Whereupon they will cry, “What a fellow that
DoRMoUSE is ’’ and apply themselves, in a most Christian spirit, to
make up for his defection.
DoRMouse, in the above instance, has kept to his expressed resolu-
tion to “make a night of it,” only he has done it in his own way.
He “makes a night of it’ in bed; and a precious long one it is too;
for though DoRMouse has no regular time for rising, he is punctual to
half an hour in retiring.
“ DoRMoºse is a horribly provoking fellow,” young BAT tells me,
and tells him, too, to his face. Young BAT is of opinion that night
was made for “sitting up.” He will stay up long past the smallest
hours without any sort of excitement, or even without a companion, as
if he expected the end of the world between twelve and six in winter
and therefore it was no use his going to bed. When he is satisfie
that another day has commenced, he looks at himself and his wry hair
in the glass, shakes his head, and after observing confidentially, that
“this sort of thing won’t do—he must give up these late hours,” he
jumps into bed; and closes his eyes to the fact | the grey dawn.
Nothing will induce DoRMouse to sit up with BAT, although he'll
begin an evening with him. DoRMoUSE will look in at BAT's rooms,
on his road home, at nine o'clock.
.." ºal !” cries BAT; “come along, and sit down. Have a
cigar -
DoRMouse returns that he doesn’t mind if he does. A cautious
character is DoRMoUs E's, you’ll observe. A somnambulist never
comes to harm if you only let him walk on ; and in my opinion DoR-
MoUse is never łºń, awake. He sits down by the fire and
commences his cigar. Conversation gets along at a fair pace; they
are plunging into the topics most interesting to Bachelors, and BAT is
warming up when DoRMouse looks at the clock, then corroborates its
evidence by his watch (some men have this morbid craving for absolute
certainty), and then says
* Eleven o'clock: "I didn't know it was so late.”
“Late l’exclaims BAT : “Nonsense ! the night's only beginning.
Have another cigar.”
“Thank you, i will,” replies DoRMoUs E.; and BAT, handing him a
light, is rejoicing at the success of his scheme for delaying his de-
parture, when DoRMoUSE takes up his greatcoat, and observes that the
cigar he has taken “will just see him home.”
“Oh, hang it !” says BAT, “stop a few minutes longer.”
It is always a request for “a few minutes” with BAT. This ex-
}. means anything from a quarter of an hour to half a day.
oRMOUSE is adamant.
“Well, then,” says BAT, with an air of decision, as if he must really
* this a matter of business, “stop till the half-hour eractly, and
then go.
Anybody but DoRMouse would yield to this: in fact, BAT knows
that, this concession once made, to gain another half-hour after that is
a comparatively easy matter. -
But DoRMoUse is granite in his determination. He merely shakes his
head pleasantly, and, putting on his hat, still puffing BAT's cigar, which
his friend considers as obtained under false pretences, he wishes BAT
good night. -
“Oh, you’re not going?” says BAT, trying to make it appear that
he really can't believe DoRMoUse to be in earnest. -
But DoRMoUs E is in earnest, and moves towards the door. BAT is
at his wits' end for ºtest to delay him, in order that he may have
some one to sit up with.
“Oh,” says BAT, suddenly, “Just stop ! I wanted to say something
very particular to you.”. DoRMoUse pauses, and, BAT feels that the
corner of the thin end of the wedge is just wriggling in, and that the
greatest delicacy of manipulation is required. - -
DoRMOUSE waits a few seconds. BAT assumes º air, as if
he was trying to recall what he so particularly wanted to say to DoR-
MOUSE. "... fails him; he can only implore his friend to “wait
a minute, and he'll think of it.” But iº observes that “it
doesn’t matter: he'll look in again another evening.”
Now, nothing annoys BAT more, at this juncture, than the postpone-
ment of a sitting. . He is inclined to say, indeed sometimes does, say,
“Ah, perhaps Islan't be here another night,” and adds, that he is
probably going to Devonshire or Cornwall for a week: which is merely
&l little, romance of his to induce DoRMoUSE to seize the present
In Omen".
“Well,” replies the imperturbable DoRMoUSE, “I must take my
chance—good night.” And before BAT has time to think of another
excuse for procrastination, DoRMOUSE has crept down-stairs, and is
out of the house. -
DAwsos DoRMouse is studying the Law. His notion is to take up
Chamber Practice. I think his idea is that there's no moving in this
ille.
“You see,” he says, while in his dressing-gown and arm-chair, with
his feet on the fender and his breakfast, at two o'clock p.m., by his
side. “Chamber practice will just suit me. In the first place, it’s
practice,”—his friend admitted that it was, -“and then it’s in a
Chamber.” This also I owned sounded far from improbable.
“Well, then,” he continues, putting one foot over the other, to give
each its due turn at the fire. “A chamber’s comfortable; there’s no
rushing into Court at ten o'clock in the morning. In fact,” he says,
pursuing his idea of chamber practice, “there's no reason why you
shouldn't see people in bed, or in your dressing-gown.”
I suppose my face assumes an air of doubt upon this point, as he
continues, “Why not I give up these chambers and I have chambers
in Lincoln's Inn; very good. I sleep there—my bed-room adjoins my
sitting-room. Client comes to clerk in the outer room; Clerk shows
him into the chamber. I am in bed, in the next room, with his papers
on the counterpane. Client wants my opinion. “W hat do you think
of So-and-so?” says, he in the sitting-room. “Well,” I should reply
from my bed-room, “it’s a case of Tenant-in-Fee,” or whateyer it
might be, you know. “All right,” he says, goes away, and I make my
fifty guineas (with something included for the clerk, you know, who
opens the door, and brushes one's clothes, and so forth) without stirring
out of bed. That’s chamber practice.”
“You don’t wear a wig, I suppose P’’ asked Goosey, who was
present, and for whom the public work of the bar had many attractions.
“A wig ’’ repeats DoRMouse, thoughtfully, as if this, was a
question on which he had read a great deal at one time, but had subse-
quently > forgotten. “A wig Well—I suppose not in chamber
practice.
“Yet,” says Goosey, “all barristers have the same dress.”.
“Ah, yes,” returns DoRMouse; “but not in chamber practice—that
is, it would be absurd to suppose that I should be obliged to wear a
wig and a gown in bed, while I am giving my opinions.”
“Of course,” says Goosey. “But no one does practise in bed.” . .
“Why not?” asks DoRMoUSE, who has evidently only chosen this
department of the Law on the distinct understanding (between himself
and imaginary Vice-Chancellors) that he can do business in his own
style, and in comfort. -
When Goosey was going to the Bar, how the Moles helped him I
will presently record.

DECANAL ITERATION.
THE DEAN OF YORK is reported to have thus spoken in improving the occasion of a deplorable
accident, the result of obvious and extreme incaution:-
“These dispensations we are unable to fathom. But this we may say, these things happen for examples,
and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.”
Suppose a man, carrying a gun at full cock, and dragging it through a hedge behind him,
shoots himself, would the DEAN of York consider that a dispensation which he was unable to
fathom * That casualty would be not a whit less mysterious than the one to which he referred.
When the Dean remarks that these things happen for examples, no doubt he is right. So did
deaths by fire through Crinoline. But when he says that º are written for our admonition,
does he ascribe sanctity to penny-a-lining? And what does he mean by “upon whom the ends
of the world are come”? Apparently much about that which was meant by the celebrated under.
graduate under examination, when, being asked who was the first King of the Jews, he
answered SAUL, but instead of limiting his
reply to that accurate statement, was,so
superfluous as to add, “which is also called
PAUL.” Unbridled iteration is no more than
what we expect from CHADBAND; but a
Dean should know where to stop.

HARK, the Convent Bell is ringing!
Child of Fashion, young and fair,
From your heart affections, clinging
Still to home, it bids you tear.
Hark, how it seems to say,
“Tired of a life too gay,
Hither your used-up soul bringing,
Come and let us crop your hair.
“Here, from constant dissipation,
You will find a nice retreat,
Of the flesh mortification;
Mouldy crusts of bread to eat:
Fat mutton if you hate,
Fat mutton on your plate.
Come where holy maceration
Shall take down your self-conceit.
“You’ll be chastened here by snubbing,
Have, for faults, to kiss the floor,
On your knees be set boards scrubbing.

Unto deaf ears may cry
For tallow, to º:
When you shall, the skin by rubbing

“Or, if there be cause to blame you,
You'll be made to knuckle down,
And, in public, more to shame you,
Wear a duster on your crown.
For bloom you’ll have disgrace
With rose to tint your face;
Here they know the way to tame you,
Or the proudest girl in Town.
“Here your tongue must be close holden

E’en with sisters you must learn.
If you exceed in chat,
You’ll punished be for that.

Or, a letter should you send,
Though to relations near,

Penance too, when you offend.
“Wholesome discipline will humble
You completely to the dust.

Or you’ll out of doors be thrust.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
THURSDAY, February 11. Of course, the universe had marked down
in its Pocket-Book (Punch's) that the Essence would be resumed next
week. But the extraordinary importance of the proceedings, of Thurs-
day last, in the House of Lords, to say nothing of Mr. Punch's glowing
impatience to rush into political fray, induces him to forestal the hap-
piness of the universe, and at once begin a New Series of Records,
which promise supernatural interest and excitement. The fiery Fish-
mongers, in their noble eagerness to learn news, gave the PREMIER and
his colleagues a splendid banquet on that same Thursday, but MR.
GLADSTONE told them only that his hand was at the ſº h, and he
did not mean to look back. Look out, therefore, for the Plough-
% or other day on which he will unveil the statue of Hibernia
cata.
In the House of Lords, to-day, the new Chancellor, LORD, HATHER-
LEY (mind, we don't object to occasionally naming the officials, but
folks with bad memories must § a Ministerial list), took his seat on
the wooladº at two o'clock. The seat of the Lord High Chancellor
of England in the House of Lords is called the woolsack, from its bein
a large square bag of wool, without back or arms, covered with re
cloth. Wool was the staple, commodity of England in the reign of
Edward THE THIRD, when the woolsack came first into use... It was
fortunate for Chancellors that so agreeable a material offered itself for
their seat, as if the staple commodity had been flint, arrow-heads,
tempenny nails, or Wenham Lake ice, their comfort might not have
been so entirely complete.
The House sat at two, in order to show that the Peers are wise men,
and despise lunch. They regard it, as did a great #. of the last
generation; namely, as an Insult to Breakfast and an Injury to Dinner.
Prayers were read by the Bishop of Hereford, DR. JAMES ATLAY.
Hereford is the capital of Herefordshire, and is a bishop's see, near
the Wye. . When a husband resembles it, in being, near the why, that
is, in thinking of demanding his wife's reason for doing Qr not doin
anything, he had better go out of town and remain in fresh air an
meditation until he shall have regained his senses.
EARL GRANVILLE, Colonial Secretary, sat on the Ministerial bench,
He was doubtless Fº to answer any question that might be put
to him as to any of the Colonies., Our colonies and dependencies em;
brace, affectionately, about one-third of the surface of the globe, and
2^NSUNCH presents his best com-
nearly a fourth of its population. Their area is more than Four Mil.
lions of square miles. Our colonial and dependencial population, at
the latest returns, was 154,810,787. LoRD GRANVILLE was ready to
#. information as to all or any of these places or people. But the
ouse of Lords was as well informed as himself; at all events it was
not considered necessary to ask him a single question. EARL DE GREY,
Lord President of the Council, sat by him, affably.
There was not anybody on any of the Opposition benches. . This, we
think, is a gratifying fact... It showed that there was no immediate
disposition on the part of the Conservatives to harass the Administra-
tion by raising factious questions. LoRD MALMESBURY has solemnl
handed over the leadership of Opposition to LoRD CAIRNs, who §
doubtless take many an opportunity to
“Show what the Arm of Old Erin has in it.”
But, ever just, Mr. Punch compliments, the Conservatives for not
having come down to the House for mischief. . He thinks it exceeding
º that they all forgot that the Lords had adjourned until this
ay, and not the following Tuesday, but there are so few occasions on
which we can safely say a civil thing about º that, we pounce
with hawk-like avidity upon any chance of being polite. This is a sad
world for disillusioning of people. , Punch heard the other day that a
publican, in a road much, frequented by the humbler class when they
take holiday, had subscribed two pounds towards a drinking-fountain
near, his place. “Noble fellow,” said, Mr. Punch. “It would seem
the last thing a vender of liquors ought to be expected to do.” So
Mr. Punch went into the liberal, man's, hostelry, and ordered refresh-
ment. While consuming it, he pleasantly complimented his temporary
host on his goodness in the matter of the fountain. He was an honest
and frank man., "I’d pay a deal more than that, Sir,” he said, “to save
the bother of children coming in, on busy days, and asking for drinks
o' water... You can’t refuse 'em, but it’s greatly in the way of busi-
ness.” But this is a digression, and we now come to the next item in
the proceedings of the day.
The Bishop of DERRY, a Representative Prelate, whose name is
WILLIAM ALEXANDER, D.D., took the oaths and his seat. Derry is
the same as Londonderry, but we presume that when the disestablish-
| ment takes place, the English half of the word will be finally cut away.
Derry is situated on the Foyle, and therefore foiled all KING, JAMEs's
army for many months (see Pinnock, also Mangnall, if you don’t believe
us). In the favourite chorus, “down, Derry down,” the famous siege'is
commemorated, º, jerry did not go down. But this is a trifle when
an antiquarian fact has to be assumed. -
It was then felt that the House should address itself to serious busi-
ness, and the Colonial Secretary rose. We usually | an extra
hydraulic screw upon speeches, but we shall give this in full:—
“I move that your Lordships adjourn to Tuesday next.”
This speech appears to us to be as nearly perfect as possible in a world
of imperfect tenses. Every word was needed. It might have been
shortened, had the Earl said, “you” instead of."your Lordships,”
but something is due to traditional courtesy. “To Toosday” would
have sounded ill—“grated,” as LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE CocKBURN says,
om an old-fashioned speaker, but LoRD GRAN VILLE is an accom-
º linguist, and hit the happy mean (not that the mean can ever
e happy) between the “too” and “tew.” Were we hypercritical we
might say that “next " might have been omitted, as the proximate day
is always taken for granted when a date is not given, yet precision
should mark the utterances of a legislator. Non offendar maculis is a
good rule, except when they are spots produced on the shirt-front by
carelessness over your soup.
The House of Peers rose at ten minutes past two.
We have depicted a placid scene....The torrent's smoothness ere it
dash below. But in the Orcades of THORMoDUs ToBFA:Us, and also in
BARTHOLINUs, is a Norse song :—
“Ere the ruddy sun be set,
Pikes must shiver, javelins sing,
Blade with clattering buckler meet,
Hauberk crash, and helmet j.
Sisters, hence, with spurs of speed,
Each her thundering falchion wield,
Each bestride her sable steed,
Hurry, hurry to the field !”
Imitate the Moon.
... If you are a wise man you will treat the World as the Moon treats
it. Show it only one side of yourself, seldom, show yourself too much
at a time, and let what you show be calm, cool, and polished. But look
at every side of the World.
OF COURSE.
THE idiot who writes to ask if DRUITT on Wines was published at
Stockton-on-Tees is beneath anybody's notice.

“THE immortal WILLIAMs” down upon it, as usual'
Although the Fishmongers' Company had not yet, in his
time, hoisted the true blue flag, as the Libera Bhoenix
of Čity companies, his prophetic pen, has bracketed for
evermore FISHMONGER with HoNEST MAN. - - -
And now GLADSTONE, whom, in his opinions, his
enemies declare to be “neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good
red herring,” but in whom Punch devoutly believes as
honest man, is, in sober earnest, the Fishmonger that
Hamlet’s “wild and whirling words” dubbed Polonius.
From this time forth he can at once enjoy the Fishmongers'
room and the Fishmongers' Company, and will find it
hard to say that the one is better than the other, the first
being the most stately of halls, as the second is the most
go-ahead of i. - -
And why should Ministers not be Fishmongers? Unless,
indeed, it be thought that, to become free of the Fish;
mongers is lèse-majesté in Ministers to their own special
mystery—THE LOAves-AND-FISH-MONGERs. -
Otherwise, the connection between Ministers and Fish-
mongers is obvious and manifold, Like the Apostles,
Ministers are fishers of men. In the way of votes all is
fish that comes to their net—odd fish or flat fish, fresh fish
or stale fish, fish with scales (to weight them in) and more
without, fish with tails (like the large family of the Tad-
poles) and fish with no more tail than WHALLEY.
Everybody has enjoyed their flounders when in diffi-
culties; has heard their opponents denounce their bills
as “fishy,” and has seen them trying to cobble up a bad
measure’b help of fresh soles and ’eels. O eWer

AIR-" We may roam through this world.”
WE may roam through this world, North and South, West and
aSt,
For the soles of our feet and our faith seeking rest
From the kingdoms of earth we know best and like least,
To the kingdoms of earth we know least and like best;
But if peace in this world and place in Heaven
Are the choicest blessings that life supplies,
Seek these where Infallibility’s leaven
Helps poor mortality's dough to rise—
In that land of lands where the Pope sits crowned,
Where Faith is at anchor, and Truth at home,
Where Doubt is dumbfoundered and Heres bound,
Seek these in that Heaven upon Earth called Rome!
Poor England in constant hot water is kept
By heretical jangle and wrangle and brawl;
Through her Church's pale blind Reason has crept,
And with fruits of faith played the deuce and all.
Ah, she wants the high º holy fence
Which rqund Rome's blessed dominion dwells,
Admitting belief while it shuts out sense,
And reason's bewildering light repels.
Then remember who in the flesh sits crowned
'Neath the one true cross on St. Peter's dome;
In the deluge of doubt who would not be drowned,
Must ship in the Ark—PETER’s bark at Rome !
France under Imperial colours may sail;
Her Colère de }. let Prussia try:
Spain may make PATRONICIo and CLARET turn tail,
And Italy bid the Church good-bye–
Pio NoNo on bay'nets be forced to sit,
French cannon guard Civita Vecchia's shore,
Rome loves the gag and adores the bit,
More kisses her rod as she’s whipped the more :
Then remember, when nations run their round
As by reason's will of the wisp they roam,
In one spot faith's steady light is found,
And that is the Heaven upon Earth, called Rome !
AN ANTI-EARTHQUAKE COMPANY (LIMITED).
THUS says the Leading Journal:—
“EARTHQUAKE TIMEs.-The citizens of San Francisco have formed a com-
mittee to inquire into the means of preventing or lessening the destruction of
property by earthquakes. The bricks used in building are reported to be very
lºve. and it is proposed to adopt a method of bracing buildings with iron
rods.’
A good precaution. But wouldn’t it be better to construct the
houses, as to their framework, altogether of iron, and build them on
:...i. Here is a suggestion for the benefit of any enterprising
speculators whom the revival of credit may dispose to invest capital in
* pºling speculation. How much for the idea P “Gentlemen
Capitalists,” as Cabby says, “Leave it to you.”
Å Joint Stock Company could be formed for the purpose of supplying
the San Franciscans and others in like case with iron architecture.
Then iron might be profitably exchanged for gold.

to speak, in the Public Service, with cries of “Clean

AND OCCASIONALLY QUITE OVER THE EYES IN FRONT.
ROBBING AND REFORMING.
We hope there is no truth in what this, Correspondent states,
although, the journal whence we cite it is not renowned for letting
falsehoods be inserted in its columns:—
“There are hundreds of hard-worked Civil Servants whose incomes are
barely sufficient to keep body and soul together. They have been for a long
time crying out (after a smothered fashion) that their salaries have become
so reduced in value, through the increased cost of living, that they find it next
to impossible to pay their way and support their families in common decency.
. . . . . The persons I refer to are clerks in outlying Government departments
of twelve to twenty years' hard service, on salaries of from £100 to £200 a year;
§ intelligent, indefatigable fellows, many of them, without whose patient
industry their well-paid chiefs—whose principal duty it is to attach their im-
ortant auto º to the productions of others' brains—would cut a sorry
gure, indeed. These are the persons, I expect, on whom the first-fruits and
benefits of financial reform will fall with a vengeance. Secretaries of State,
Chancellors of the Exchequer, and “my Lords' know nothing of them. They
are too small to be recognised as parts of the Government machinery, and their
cries rarely reach the atmosphere which surrounds “my Lords.'”
Retrenchment, it is true, is now the order of the day, but in aiming
at retrenchment the nation, we should hope, has no desire for robbery.
Now it really would be robbery, to cut down the small pay of some
or devil of a clerk, to whom the cost of living has of late been nearly
oubled., Good work deserves good pay: and if MR. BULL expects to
have his books well kept, and his income well collected, he must not
starve the men who often have the means of cheating him.

(Being from “Home” of course the Theatre here represented is

who apparently belongs to a party of sir. On his right is an
ELDERLY LADY with eye-glasses, and, neart to her, a younger

to Town, determined to see as much as possible in a short time.
Well-informed Person. I chose this night because it’s the first of the
new piece, and you’ll see all the Theatrical and Literary notabilities here.
Elderly Lady (referring to bill, under a sort of impression that she’ll

[Rustling in the Stalls. Enter a brilliant party of two Ladies and
two Gentlemen. They nod and smile to sereral people in the back
row. While the Ladies are settling themselves doicn, the Gentle-
men nod and smile to rarious persons in the front rows, as if
congratulating themselves and ererybody else on haring done g
something curiously clerer and witty in being there at all. When
the party is seated, they are acknowledged by other parties in
private bores. More nodding and smiling.

the salute. A Gentleman's head appears from behind the bor-curtain, and
botos and smiles to Lady in Stalls, then nods sometchat jocially to her
companion. The idea conveyed to a looker-on is, that if they were not

PUNCHPS ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
FEBRUARY 16. Tuesday. The QUEEN’s Speech was read by LoRD
CHANCELLOR HATHERLEY, his first appearance as a reader of QUEEN’s
Speeches. MR. GLADSTONE had not given him a great deal to do.
l. HER MAJESTY recurred to the advice of Parliament as early as
Ministerial arrangements had permitted.
2. Did so with special interest, at a time when the Popular branch
had been chosen with the ºf: of a greatly enlarged enfran-
chisement of her faithful and loyal people.
. All right with Foreign Powers. Believed that they desired to
keep the peace.
. Rejoiced that there was nothing serious in the Levant.
. Hoped to place friendship with America on a firm basis.
. Grieved at disturbances in New Zealand. Was confident that the
Colonists would take care of themselves.
. The Estimates would show A DIMINISHED CHARGE UPON THE
CountRY.
... We need not continue to suspend Irish Habeas Corpus.
. Can we have further guarantee for purity and liberty at Parlia-
mentary and Municipal elections?
Poorest class of Ratepayers to be relieved.
. Scotch Education to be improved.
. Also English Endowed Schools,
. Invent Financial Boards to control the County rate.
. Reform in Bankruptcy. Abolition of Imprisonment for Debt.
. THE ECCLESIASTICAL ARRANGEMENTs of IRELAND are to be
considered at an º date.
(a) Regard to be shown to every legitimate interest.
% Welfare of Religion to be promoted through equal justice,
c) Undivided feeling of Ireland to be secured on the side of
loyalty and law.
(d) Memory of former contentions to be effaced.
(e) Sympathies of an affectionate people to be cherished.
WOL, LVI.
That was what LoRD HATHERLEY had to say, and the intelligent
reader, even without the help of the sMALL CAPITALs, might perceive
that there were º two points of much interest. fiema just note
that No. 3 means that it is politic to seem to think that France and
Prussia do not want to quarrel, though the former is nagging viciously
at the latter, through Belgium. , No. 5 meant that nothing was settled
with America, except the yacht-match, and if the Speech had been
delayed forty-eight hours, the QUEEN would have had to mention that
America rejects the Reverdy-Johnson Convention. No. 6 means
that the New Zealand colonists, who ſº at our soldiers, are not
ping to have them again, but must fight the Maori on their own hook;
o.9 is interpreted by sundry to mean that the Government are inclined
to the Ballot. No. 14 we seem to have heard once or twice before.
There was another thing which might as well have been mentioned
in the Speech, except that it is gracious for a Queen, to say as little
about disagreeable matters, as may be. The HöME SECRETARY, the
next evening, gave notice of a measure for the Repression of Crime...
Nos. 7 and 15, meaning Reduced ; and Irish Church Dis-
establishment, will be the great texts for Parliamentary preaching upon.
As for the Debates on the Address, they really do not deserve, so
hard a name. Honey on velvet, flowers, compliments, everything that
is delightful. Loºns, the ſeamediawyer and brilliant debater, who
has, succeeded dear MALMEsBURY as leader of the Opposition, has
nothing to find fault with, and was blandness itself. LORD GRANVILLE
is always polite, and to-night expressed modest concern that he had to

succee
Enº Russº. "We believe that Lord Carrºs was going in the
excess of his good humour to say “So have I,” but was pulled down
by his moral coat-tails. All was over by seven.
In the Commons announcement was made by MR,GLADSTONE that
i Monday, the lst of March, he should reveal his Irish Church
scheme.
LoRp EustAce CECIL (brother of LoRD SALISBURY) means to deal
with the tradesfolk, Pancras vestrymen or others, who use fraudulent
weights and measures, and Mr. Punch hereby pledges himself to stand
by LoRD EUSTACE in this crusade.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Honourable HENRY CowPER moved the Address, which was
seconded by MR. MUNDELLA, new Member for, Sheffield. MR. Dis-
RAELI thought that the former had spoken with ability. Doubtless the
latter *. so about himself.
Really, MR. DisrAELI and MR. GLADstoNE were so courteous and
civil to one another, that Punch had better refer the universe to his
Cartoon, for an idea of the impression produced upon him. .
MR. WHITE asked why the Speech said nothing about Spain.
MR. GLADston E replied, that as the work of the Spaniards was in-
complete, it would have been premature to talk about it, but that they
had, of course, our best sympathy. As MR. WHITE is a China mer-
chant, it seems to Mr. Punch that the , Honourable Member for
Brighton might more properly have inquired why we heard nothing of
the new treaty by which we are bound not to cut off an offending
Chinaman's pigtail ourselves, but to remit him for Imperial justice.
Some of º lesser stars blazed out a little. MR. NewDEGATE inge-
niously suggested that the reason why the Spanish revolution had not
been mentioned was that it was a heavy blow and a great discourage-
ment to the Pope, whose friends in the Government did not like to
allude to the subject. Sure#. MR. New DeGATE must have said this
to oblige WHALLEY-he could not have meant such nonsense on his
own account.
MR. MACFIE, Member for Leith, was pleased that Scotland was
mentioned in the Speech. This was becomingly humble, as t
was said of Scotland was, that her education would bear improving.
MR. MºMAHON was not pleased that there was no mention of a new
Reform Bill for Ireland. What, another! Come, has not Ireland got
her share of the programme for this Session ?
SIR P. O'BRIEN hoped that Government would let Fenian bygones
be bygones in Ireland. -
MR. HADFIELD spoke ill of Bishops, and hoped that they would all
be ejected from the House of Lords, their restoration to which was one
of the blackest pages in history. Hereat was laughter, and the speaker
then sneered at the Bishops as old tutors and schoolmasters. The
venerable schismatic must have been getting crusty for want of his
dinner. The House may have felt this, for the Address was instantly
voted, and we were up by 7'45.
Wednesday. Symptoms that the halcyon days will not last. LoRD
RoBERT Montague brought in a Bill about Cattle, and MR. HEADLAM
promised to defeat it if he could. |
Thursday. The young DUKE of Norfolk, Earl of Arundel and of
Surrey, Baron Fitz-Alan,Clun, Oswaldestre, and Maltravers, descendant
of him of whom we have all read:—
“The murdered Surrey's love, the tears of GERALDINE,”
took the oath and *d as Hereditary Earl Marshal, Premier Duke
and Earl of England.
My Lords grumbled a deal because the Ministers will not give them
Bills to discuss. Specially they demanded the Bankruptcy Bill, but the
CHANCELLOR urged that it contains so much that affects the -
interest as to be a measure which the Commons ought first to have.
A graceful announcement was made in both Houses. The QUEEN
desired to receive, in Person, the Addresses in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. It was stated that Her Majesty had been most
anxious to open the Reformed Parliament; but, said M.R. GLADSTONE,
the Sovereign “ had been suffering, more than usual, from severe
head-ache, and to a degree which precluded the required exertion.”
That simple and homely language should be felt to be appropriate, and
in tone with the affectionate relations which QUEEN VICTORIA has ever
held with her people.
The Constitution, however, is always remembered, and English
statesmen never forget precedent. It is exceptional for the Houses to
attend a monarch with addresses, unless the Speech to which they
reply has been delivered in person. One exception was made
after the battle of Trafalgar inſ M.R. GLADSTONE, thought that ours
was somewhat of a kindred case, “the celebration of a great and
eaceful triumph, which largely extends the liberties of the people.”
K. DISRAELI held it “important and desirable that some personal
relations should be established between the QUEEN and the new Par-
liament,” but desired all precaution against the establishment of a
precedent. SIR LAwRENCE PALK, of East Devon, winced at MR.
GLADSTONE’s mention of a triumph, and protested against any con-
gratulation on a “political” victory. Of course, in both Houses the
assent to the Royal visit was unanimous. -
In the Commons the Right Hon. JoHN BRIGHT gave his first
Ministerial answer—it was to say that the Portpatrick lighthouse
would probably extinguish its light.
Do you know what Hypothec is? Find out. , Or you may save
yourselves the trouble, as it is going to be abolished... .
MR, FoRSTER, brought in his Bill for reconstituting Endowed
Schools. There is also to be an Examining Council, which is to have
compulsoryP. and to give certificates to masters and scholars.
There will be an Irish row presently, MR. JohnstoN, remote Tory,
and the O’Donoghue, remote Liberal, combine to have the Party
-
|Processions Act repealed. whack ! Your sowls to glory ! Ubbubboo,
&c., &c.
Friday. It was announced, in both Houses, that HER MAJESTY
would receive the Addresses on the following, Monday. But the
nation next day heard, with sorrow, that the illness of the PRINCE
Leopold would detain his Royal Mother at Osborne.
Two matters of different interest º: themselves in the House
of Commons. A protest, raised by LoRD ELCHO, and seconded by the
Chief Commissioner of Works, against a useless and hideous viaduct
to be raised in the rear of the beautiful Embankment; and a revelation,
by MR, FowleR, of such atrocities, perpetrated by our allies the Boers,
upon the miserable Kaffirs, as may here only be alluded to. We arm
the Boers, and refuse arms to the Kaffirs, so that the savage murder
of the latter is easy—and the Boers do worse than murder. It seems
that we cannot interfere, but we can cease to sell guns to the Boers—
and this has been ordered. About as revolting a bit of detail this
night, as you shall find in your Parliamentary annals, MR. PHILISTINE
PHARISEE BULL.
GREEK STREET ALIAS QUEER STREET.
..THE Times Correspondent at Athens lets in a startling light on the
little game of the last Greek Cabinet, or rather its head, M. BUL.GAREs.
It seems that M. BUL.GAREs came into office a year ago with a pro-
gramme of peace, retrenchment, and administrative reform, very much
of the cut of MR. GLADSTONE's, in short. -
During eight months he carried out a policy in the teeth of his pro-
gramme, blowing up the coals of war, increasing expenditure, and
reforming nothing. - - -
At last, having emptied the national till, being unable to raise a
§ on the security of Greek credit, and his, Financial Minister
eing at his wits' end—not a very long journey, M. BUL.GAREs found
himself on the horns of a dilemma, between resignation and bank-
ruptcy. The only thing like hard cash within reach was the specie in
the National Bank, and the only way to get hold of that was by blowing
the trumpet of war till the Chamber voted a war contribution of a
|million drachmas, and gave the Minister leave to get the money when-
ever he could find it. And then M. BULGAREs walked into the bank,
and º: out its specie-drawer. Then came, in rapid succession, the
Crisis, the Conference, and the Collapse. Greece" is left humiliated
and sulky, with its paper-currency inconvertible, its industry stagnant,
and its property insecure.
Mr. Punch, on the faith of these facts, would ask leave to alter a
proverb and a name.
For the well-known line—
“When Greek meets Greek then comes the tug of war,”
he would propose to read henceforth
“When Greek robs Greek then comes the talk of war;”
and the “BULGAREs Cabinet” he would have re-christened the
* “Burglarious Cabinet.”
Strange Food.

His palate oft regales,
Feeds upon toadstools, nor impure
Accounts a dish of snails;
“And under Marlow Bridge ah, why,
My friends,” he says, “should we

Carried without a Division.
A DINNER was lately given at one of the great hotels, to bring"the
Australian preserved meat into notice. If, by the introduction into
England of these provisions, which seem to be moderate in price, some
of those amongst us who now seldom, if ever, taste animal food, can
get a good mourishing meal, everyone must wish success to such a
meritorious case of Dish-establishment.
Reversing the Order of Things.
AT a recent meeting of the “Victoria Institute” a paper was read
“On the Doctrine of Creation, according to DARwiN, AGAssiz, and
Moses.” Would it not have been more reverent if the last of these
three names had been placed first 3

stress which his critical admirers have laid upon his virility. Could it not be
agreed, all round, once for all, that MR. WHITMAN is “a man, and a very

of nothing so much as a crazy auctioneer, which MR. WHITMAN continues to
publish under the name of poetry.”

TAR TAR.
A VERY º story of ºff, and feathering comes by a recent
Melbourne letter. A person of the name of BLAck went to survey
some mining property, and was laid hold of by a gang of ruffians, who
tarred him, and then coated him with “fragments of wool, straw, or
whatever rubbish came to hand.” But BLACK is evidently a very long-
headed man, and instead of divesting himself of his uncomfortable
attire he had it “taken off” by a photographer. With this negative
argument in his favour he goes into court claiming two thousan
pounds damages. We heartily hope he will obtain a verdict.

ONE of the first things the House of Commons did, was to appoint a
Committee to control the arrangements of the kitchen and refreshment-
rooms, and, very wisely too, to place an Alderman upon it. As another
prominent member is FRENch, and ViviaN has a convivial sound about
it, the prospects of the Parliamentary cuisine may altogether be con-
sidered good cheerful. -
A FINE OPENING. l
HERE's a chance l. The Strand Union is prepared to give twenty
ounds a year and part rations to a night nurse. Her hours are to be
rom seven in the evening till seven in the morning. What munifi-
cence Almost as much as the wages of an errand boy.
THE HAIR AND MANY FRIENDS.
VICTORY | Victory! Glorious news, my Punch. Only look at this:–
“The great ladies of Paris have determined to abolish chignons. False
hair is to i. repudiated, and women are to appear as if they dressed their own
hair. In the }. the hair is to be simply plaited and confined in a net.
In the evening it will only be needful to put on the head a crown, or a
wreath of roses or ivy, or some other creeping plant.”
A bas les chignons / be our battle-cry in England, now that Common
Sense has won the fight in France. W. great ladies do the less are
sure to imitate. No more wigs for women!... No more borrowed
lumes to bedizen silly jackdaws' No more piling up of Pelion on
É. or, as wags would say, on 'Oss hair Ladies, for the future, or
f|at any rate for the present, are to dress their heads au naturel, and
only wear a crown, or else a wreath of roses, or some trifle of that sort.
As they are to have the option, I would advise their wearing roses rather
than a crown, for “uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,” and only
queens of fashion can be the fitting wearers of one. As for ladies
wearing creepers in their hair, I see no harm in this, so long as they
are only of a vegetable species. From creepers, such as gregarines
and other little insects, ladies' heads will now be free, and this is more
than could be said of them while chignons were in vogue. So long as
these excrescences are worn, if I were a young man I should think
twice before I asked 'a girl to give me a lock of her hair, lest I
might discover it was hers by purchase only, when a microscope might
show me certain little specimens of animated nature, imported possibly
from Russia, and these would not increase my admiration or my love,

Manager. And in a brougham, too. (Growls, but remembers the palue
of Stalls and Private Boares.) Well, go on : this sort of thing won’t do.
No it won’t, and here’s poor honest hard-working and pretty Miss
SMITH at fifteen or twenty shillings a week, with shoes and tights to find,
has had to stop here all the morning, dinnerless, and she can’t leave on
any account, or if she did, she’d be fined. But you can’t fine Stalls and
Private Bores, you know. An old story, perhaps, but one that doesn't
come in badly now ye Gentlemen ºf England who sit in your stalls at

KINGS AND OTHER THINGS OF SPAIN.
So FRANCIso is to be King of Spain. , What? The late titular
king, F. DE Assis? No, M’m, he sporteth on the Boulevards, and
may sport. , Don't you know that his name, is FRANCIsco – if
women would only be accurate P It is Field Marshal DoN FRAN-
ciso SERRANo Y DomingUEz, Duke de la Torre, born at Cadiz, 1810.
What, King * Well, as soon as the Cortes shall have verified them-
selves, he is to be head of all things, and to form a new Cabinet. That
| is uncommonly like Kingship, M'm. The Directory seems to be laid
on the shelf—a new nation cannot produce a good one, like KELLY's,
or THQM's. KING SERRANo would sound very well, SERRANo, in
Spanish, means Montagnard in French, and Highlander in English,
So we may say of him, with the Princess in Love's Labour's Lost—
“Who e'er he be, he shows a mountain mind.”
It is possible, of course, that this mountain may bring forth a mouse in
the shape of an insignificant king, of royal blood; but if we were
SERRANo, and PRIM didn't mind, and the army were affable, we should
put it to the Spanish nation whether a native nobleman were not better
than a foreign prince. And probably Echo would (as a great writer
said) answer in the affirmative.
Goody Four Shoes.
By the more humane farriery which “The British Goodenough
Horseshoe Company” wish to introduce, it appears that the horse is
likely to be the gainer. On this account alone, therefore, the object of
the company is good enough for us to wish it success.

The Queen's Speech.
“The Lord CHANCELLOR read, on
yesterday afternoon, to the assembled
Peers and Commons, a speech which,
for directness, clearness, and grave
dignity, will challenge comparison
with any that have been put in the
mouth of HER MAJESTY since her
accession. A good cause, a knowledge
that the nation is in thorough sym-
pathy with the Government, and a
clear view of the immediate exigen-
cies of political progress in England,
have helped MR. GLADsTone to an
exposition of his policy, at once simple
and impressive, which stands out in
marked contrast to the rhetorical
cloud of phrases in which MR. Dis-
RAELI has been accustomed to mask
his meaning, or his want of meaning.”

“The House of Commons, held to

SINGING BLACKBIRD, AND OTHERS WHICH WILL BE SEEN WHEN
ExHIBITED–SO WE PASS ON.
DoRMoUSE gave Goosey some excellent advice. It was on the oc-
casion of young LURCHER asking DoRMOUSE to go into the country
for a week or two. DoRMoUSE refused. It was winter time, an
as you could scarcely get, DoRMOUSE out of his room even to a five
o'clock dinner at Lincoln's Inn, it wasn't likely that any inducement
would entice him into the country; besides, there was the chance of
Christmas festivities, of late hours, of not being able to go to bed
when you like, and being obliged to get up (by abominable bells, and
family rules and regulations) when you didn't like. Now, though this
is always the reason of DoRMOUSE's refusal to invitations, yet he
is fond of putting it down to business. - -
“You see,” said he to Goosey, “when you’re at the Bar, or going in
for chamber practice, you must be on the spot.”
Goosey said he thought that there was good sense in that.
“Now,” DoRMOUSE went on, “if clients, and you know anybody
may be a client—” he announced this as if it was a profession without
an examination attached – “if clients see you always on the spot,
they’ll trust you, and give you business. But if they don't see you on
the spot, you know, why what the deuce are they to do?” -
DoRMoUSE was perfectly satisfied with º, on the spot without
any further results. When in bed, he is on the spot. “Well,” he
reasons, “there I am; if clients want me, where’s a better place to
find me? I’m certain there : I can’t gad about when I’m in bed, can
I ? Then I get up : well, I’m still on the spot; in my room ; that’s
simple enough.” -
e has stayed, “on the spot” for some . having adopted
chamber practice, but I never yet heard of any client attempting to find
him there. Yes, there is a story of one client, who, being directed
thither by a friend of the family, thought he’d do the young barrister
a turn. #. went to chambers at 11 A.M., and was informed by the
clerk on the landing that he wasn’t to knock, as MR. DoRMoUse was
asleep, and wouldn't, probably, be up till about two. Of course, the clerk
was threatened with dismissal, but was let off on account of his plead
ing insufficiency of instruction; for it was not till, after this that the
formula was invented, “MR. DoRMoUSE is §. busy just now, Sir;
but he’ll see you in a few minutes, if you’ll walk in and take a seat.
What name shall I say, Sir P”
The other occupant of the Chambers where Goosey was received
when the Jolly Old Cock’s door had been shut against him was, as I
have already mentioned, ToM PoRCUPINE.
ToM lives now, as then, by his quills, and being a cheery, soft-
hearted warm-natured creature, he is perpetually guarding his goo
nature, and keeping it prisoner behind a very fortress of bristly points.
He wouldn’t hurt a fly, though perhaps he would draw the line at
bluebottles; which is excusable. - -
Excusable ! To kill a bluebottle is meritorious. Who kills his hun-
dreds deserves well of his country. For, what one single recommen-
dation to our respect, esteem or charity does a bluebottle possess?
On my word I don’t know. I hate a bluebottle; as much as he
hates me. A thought strikes me, have I mistaken his motive 2 Is it

against the ceiling, settling somewhere to be in reach of me, coming
suddenly, in (it may be), quite a º manner, on to my paper or
book, and causing me to dash down the pen or book, and utter a fine
old Saxon monosyllable?
If I see children making es of paper, and therein imprisoning
bluebottles, I say to them, *. my dears, is cruelty;”, but I say
it, as it were, professionally, in my character of senior, and therefore
guardian, but my sympathies are with those little ones whose cry is
war to the
is not sufficient punishment.
For myself, I don't, now, wait until I find the bluebottle on my beef
or nose: ſkill him when I take him, giving him no benefit of a doubt.
He is a bluebottle, and therefore in my eyes guilty. It is nothing
to me that it is his first day of existence, it is nothing to me that
he has never “blown upon ’’ the food in my larder. He may. If
he lives, he will. I can’t take him and educate him; therefore he
dies. I can't, send a bluebottle to a reformatory; therefore I, provi.

expensive), on the table, on the table-cloth (which has to be sent to the
wash forthwith, that the unsightly stains of gore may be effaced), on
my friend's back, on my horse's shoulder, wherever the insect may be,
down I come upon him, and down I shall always come upon him,
while I have life, health, and strength, with the Law of Lynch, free
from all forms and dilatory processes. ToM Porcup, NE could put u

the noble Roman would rather not have had about him (this is my
fº way of saying that he was of the lean kine), there must
ave been in , him something peculiarly attractive to bluebottles.
Perhaps 'twas his known long-suffering towards flies that encouraged
the brutes to annoy him, specially at his work.
PorcupiNE used to write criticisms on theatrical and operatic mat-
ters for a weekly paper, and many an author and singer owe their
escape from the sharp point of the Porcupine Sºl to the bluebottles
". whom he used to visit all his wrath. Not that the journal in
which Porcu PINE’s articles appeared was so influential on matters of
art as either the critic or his proprietors imagined; but that is not to the
purpose. If ToM was disgusted with a piece, an actor, or a singer in
summer time, as surely as The would sit down to smash them with one
of his fiercest quills, buzz would come a bluebottle, and in order to
write at all, it became necessary to rid himself of histormentor. Then
Porcu PINE, glutted with the sacrifice of his victim, would, in a calm
frame of mind, and at peace with all the world, re-consider his trucu-
lent criticism, and would either destroy the sheet already penned,
or, after erasure, would substitute something which, compared to the
cancelled opinions, was as mild as milk-and-water.
ToM PoncUPINE would say a sharp cutting thing for the sake of say-
ing it; and would attempt to tone it down afterwards. This did not
make him many friends—but what matter? Who has many friends
| And are they only to be made by perpetual soft-sawdering and
palavering”. Bah! a fico for such, . . Give me, ToM PorcupiNE
with his spring of tears out of the softest heart, and his artificial well
of cynicism in which the little bucket is always being worked up and
down. Everyone can see a well; but a spring is invisible.
'Tis these confounded bluebottles have led me into this digression,

bottle repeats itself, and I regret, by anticipation, what I know I shall
say in my wrath..... -
There is a publication called Good Words—it is bound up at the end
of the year, and is edited by a clergyman. Can you imagine a com-
panion annual entitled Bad Mords, and not edited by a clergyman? In
such a work I should insist upon a great many marginal references,
shifting on to the wings of the bluebottles the responsibility of whatever
I might utter, in moments of heat, during June, July, and the first two
weeks, at least, of August.
| Mais revenir à mon Porcupine,
| He will do you, or anyone, a good turn if he can, and go out of his
way to do it; yet he must needs be for ever pumping up satirical
humour, and cynical speeches. . He used to be fond of attributing all
apparently good actions to selfishness; and this for the sake of startling
us with a theory which was as clever as it was infernally (that’s the
word) unpleasant.
ToM PorcupiNE would splash almost every one over with the word
Snob in large letters; those who escaped that bespattering were
“Swells.” He affected age and the wisdom of experience; would
generally assist a friend with the best possible advice, on which he
could never act were the case in question his own.
| When the Goose, ToM PorcupixE, and DAwson DoRMOUSE were
young men all together, Toyſ the Elder would look upon the other two
as “swells,” because they had university friends, received invitations
to parties in Belgravia, wore white ties at the theatres, and dressed in
| the fashion of the day, which Toyſ affected to despise. He thought of
|DR. Johnson, and took some praise to himself for a certain amount of
slovenliness and carelessness in his apparel.
How delighted his real friends were when he became suddenly suc-
cessful! for ToM, PorcupiNE, then, bashfully broke upon us in faultless
trousers, and a hat which in polish was only equalled by his boots,
and rivalled by his gloves. -
He had been to a first-rate tailor's slyly, and in a huffy sort of way,
as if the idea of his doing this sort of thing was too ridiculous: so his
| coat and waistcoat were models of artistic cut.
A friend ºfºlº him on “ º Grub Street : ” whereat
|T& *. think he blushed; but a blush doesn’t show much
against his red whiskers] and sang out, “I’d be a butterfly,” and im-
mediately fell to making cynical remarks on his clothes, his boots, his
hat, his gloves, and everything that was his. But at night didn't he
ut them carefully out to be brushed, and wasn’t he particular in
#. directions to the maid as to folding and brushing?
But it was before these gay days that ToM Porcy PINE and DoR-
MoUse invited Goosey to stay. Now, of what came of that invitation,
and how Goosey did stay with DoRMOUSE and PorgūPINE, and of the
Moles (aforesaid in last chapter), and of what they did for him, and of
the Funny Dog, and of the º, and of Miss NIGHT-
INGALE (not FlorFNCE), and of ific Little Duck, is it not all written in
the Seventh Chapter of the Chronicles of Birds and Beasts and Fishes:
No, it is not. But a part thereof is; to which we will now come, and
thereto I do plight you my troth.

DINNER AND DICTIONARY.
MR. PUN
CH,
. I READ that “The Dictionary Club held their second dinner,” and for the
first time in my life I think of a Dictionary as convivial, enjoying itself in tem-
porary forgetfulness of all the cares and anxieties of derivation, definition, and
orthogpy. I amusemyself with wondering what the rules can be which each member
of this club is expected to have imprinted on his memory. I assume that every-
body present is bound to employ in conversation at table only such words as are to
be found in our best Dictionaries; and that any member is fined a page of John-
son, folio edition, to be learnt off by heart and recited fasting at the next meeting,
who, when warmed by generous wine, has the misfortune to let drop a slang or
colloquial expression. Then I picture to myself all the º rising when the
cloth is drawn, and drinking, in solemn silence, the toast of “The Health of the
Great }:#. and see them immediately afterwards busy with a word, say
concrete, or idiosyncrasy, or metaphysics, or protoplasm, or something of the same
simple character, just sufficient to exercise the brain and assist the digestion, and
writing their definition of it down on a piece of paper (with illustrative
tions), for the Chairman of the evening to read out, and the assembly to decide
which is the best. Engaged in such farmless recreation, I can imagine the club
*:::::: most agreeable evening over their words and wine. Probably between
the definitions they have a quire to sing to them some charming little Anglo-
Saxon mor;eau, or comic song in Low Dutch.
. Nothing further suggests itself to me at present, except that I cannot doubt there
is a stringent regulation to prevent gentlemen being carried away, by philological
excitement, and getting three sheets in the wind; and another forbidding the use
of cabs or vehicles of any kind, either in coming to, or going from, the place of
meeting, every member of such a Club being reasonably expected to be a Walking

A Pleasing Conviction.
THERE are certain Theatres in London to which we go, feeling sure that if not
§§ ourselves, we are certain to see others transported, such is the character
of the pieces produced.
A GENUINE MASON.
Dedicated as our Contribution to First-class SERGEANT MAson,
of the X Division, recently rewarded and promoted for his
gallant conduct on the 5th of January last.
It was the time ’twixt night and morn,
Four burglars in a cart were borne,
Along the Uxbridge Road.
º had been practising their art,
And all their plunder in the cart,
Had safe away been stowed.
They do not fear to laugh and talk
Over each silver spoon or fork.
The four were maméd thus:—
First Downy Dick, then STUNNING JEM,
The next the “Doctor,” and with them
Comes the gay magsman Gus.
A figure on the road is clear,
A mounted officer draws near-
“A Peelerſ’ cries young Dick.
“”Tis SERGEANT MAsoN,” says the one
Who knew him best, “By goles, we’re done,
Doctor! we’ll hook it quick.”
The Sergeant stops the trotting mare,
“I know you all—what have youthere?
You're prisoners—yield to me.”
“What four to one, and prisoners' No!
Back from the rein you fool, leave go!”
Cries Dick, no coward he.
They ply the whip, but 'tis too late,
The mare o'erburdened by the weight,
Against the lash revolts.
Then SERGEANT MAson seizes Gus, -
And Dick. Says JEM, “He shan’t take us.”
And with the Doctor bolts.
Unequal combat! two to one,
Both armed with bludgeons. Then the Sun
Rises to view the fight.
It sees two burglars on the ground,
By hero-sergeant tightly bound,
And crowns him with its light.
Rewards I trow has MASON gained,
Guerdons more honourably obtained
Were never yet bestow'd.
Say are there more like MAsoN who
Stopped the four burglars and bound two
pon the Uxbridge Road?

the public offices.
Well—the Public Offices may want to be kept afloat, now
that everybody is trying to run them down, but we should
doubt the feasibility of buoying them up in this way. To
judge by Mr. Punch's experience of “boys” in his own
office, he is disposed to think they spoil †: as much in
bad work as they save in salary, to say nothing of the wear
and tear of temper and waste of time in looking after them.

Why did the Ministers make the QUEEN call the
Commons the Popular branch of the legislature? Was it
not rude to ignore what I said in my City speech, and what
Professor ThoroLD Rogers does not seem to like, namely,
that we Bishops are the Popular element, and 3 priori

not snub churchmen. Allow us to be populares, while they

MR. PUNCH hoped, a few years ago, that by publishing the lines of
which the following are part, he should, as Mr. Puff says, have placed
the petting of criminals “in so ridiculous a light” that the system
would have been done away. Yet it not only goes on, but the petted
ones exult in it, and even sing Mr. Punch's song with insulting mirth.
He had to note this fact in September, 1864 (does He, any more than

ALDERMAN WILSON has just told the Middlesex Magistrates that a

For all their care of me.
“Not more than others I deserve,
In fact, much less than more,
Yet I have food, while others starve,
Orbeg, from door to door.”
We are sorry that the interesting creature should have applied our
moral wrongly, and we can only hope that the next gaol he gets into
he will find that we have been understood in a sense made clear to him
by his finding nothing to sing about, except in the way of singing out.
Falsehood and Its Reverse.
It is satisfactory to know by telegram that:—
“The Sultan of Zanzibar has imprisoned the man Mosa, who gave false
intelligence regarding DR. LIVINGstone.” -
MR. Mosa, or whatever his name is, will now, perhaps, learn to tell
the truth, by lying in prison.

at Marly. In a letter from Paris we are informed that the EMPEROR

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
FEBRUARy 22. Monday. EARL RUSSELL delighted the Peers by an
intimation that as soon as he should be instructed, from returns, upon
certain points connected with national education, he would deliver a
speech upon that novel and entertaining subject. The Peers, unable
to contain their joy, instantly went away.
Cattle plague was mentioned in the H. of C. Such mention gives
Mr. Punch a peg on which to hang a note that Miss CouTTs has pub-
lished a kindly and Nº. lea (pardon the tautology, Wardens of
our Hearts) in behalf of yout cattle, better known as calves, who
are cruelly treated by the ruffians to whom for the most part the con:
veyance of the poor creatures is entrusted. Miss Coutts urges that,
at a time when we are paying so much attention to criminal bipeds,
it would be but Christianlike to spare a little for innocent quadrupeds.

in the Castle of Indolence, actually asked when the holidays were to
be. It was not afortnight since school had met. Doctor GLADSTONE,
Head Master, could not say, but was willing to hear what the boys
wished, Easter falling so early. He was for giving them a Vacation
when they had done something more to earn it—and, he added, as a
placebo, when they would have a more genial season for its enjoyment.
j asked to define a House, the same great master of definition

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Tuesday. “You want work, my Lords, do you?” said LoRD PRIvy
SEAL KIMBERLEY. “You shall be obliged. MR. BRUCE has handed
over to me the Bill for the Suppression of Crime, and I will thank you
to be in your places on Friday.” “Since your Lordship is suppressing,
we’ll come,” said the Peers, who were evidently acquainted with the
Boiler, in Dombey.
In reply to LoRD ELCHO, MR. CARDWELL, Secretary-at-War, made
a dignified and resolute little speech, which was applauded. First, we
learned the grand universal fact that the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE is not
the Commander-in-Chief, but a Field-Marshal commanding in chief,
and, secondly, that he is under the command of MR. CARDw ELL, who
intended that he should remain so. This plain speech (it was a trifle
but not much more euphemistic—no, not euphuistic, you ass; EUPHUES
was a quaint writer, with a peculiar style) pleased the House of
Commons.
Little Girls, mind your P's and Q's, and indeed all your alphabet,
especially, your I. Q. U. For a great man, a Minister, stood up to:
night, and declared that an Infant might be arrested on a writ of
capias, and that a child above twelve might be outlawed, if a boy, and
younger, if a girl. It is no silly talk, my dears, for a girl under fourteen

We debated, on LoRD BURY’s motion, whether a section of the
Statute of ANNE (not the Statue, that's before St. Paul’s, hass), which
makes it needful for a person who takes office under the Crown to be
re-elected, should be done away, as needless and inconvenient. The
House was indisposed to disturb old arrangements. MR. VERNoN
HARcourt (Historicus) made an effective maiden speech against change.
Quº EN ANNE is dead, but her statute is not to be ºf
The noticeable point in a debate on the Excessive Taxation of
Houses and Land (MR. GLADSTONE will attend to it when he has a
little spare time) was the astounding statement by MR. NEWDEGATE
that a certain High Official, pestered with applications, writes in a
corner of the applicant's letter, as instruction to the secretary for
reply, U. B. D. We have not the faintest idea what is meant.
The Lateral Viaduct, with which it is intended to spoil the Embank-
ment, was laudably hindered by MR. LAYARD, according to promise,
and referred to a Committee. He who would spoil the noble new Via
ought to be Ducked.
Wednesday. Salmon in again. And very good it is, and how we pity
the ignorant wretches who eat lobster sauce with it, or º else,
except a few drops of lemon-juice or Chili. However, this has nothing
to do with MR. DoDDs’s motion for information about some “fishing
coops” of LoRD LONSDALE’s, in which we suppose his Lordship keeps
hens when salmon mustn't be caught.
Thursday. Thanks to John KNox, education in Scotland has been
for many generations provided by Compulsory Rating. The schools
are so good that, as the DUKE OF ARGYLL told us to-night, the children
of the peasant, the tradesman, the gentleman, sit on the same form,
and learn, not only the 3 R's, but geography, history, and very
often Latin and Greek. It is perfectly unfair that a part of the island
should enjoy such advantages in the race, and no wonder the Scots
win it so often. This system must either be put a stop to, and the Scots
children be reduced to the coarse level of English training, or England
must have similar chances. Manet sors tertia, repeal the Act of Union.
Meantime, the greedy Scotch, on the plea that parishes have outgrown
original, arrangements, are actually going to improve their already
admirable system, liberalising it—on religious matters—into the bar-
gain. The weaseſ wants to suck more of the eagle's princely eggs.
And is never to be caught asleep.
MR. DILKE asked his first question—we hope to hear him ask many
another, as he is not a gentleman likely ever to put a foolish one. It
was whether the capital of India is not henceforth to be some healthier
place than Calcutta. MR. GRANT DUFF is not yet in a position to reply.
CAPTAIN STAcPoole asked a very proper question about the Oriental
Vagabonds who scowl about our streets, and demanded why a whole-
some Indian rule providing for the return of exported servants were
broken. He was told that most of these vagrants were independent
adventurers, which we believe cum granis multis.
MR. Gösch EN introduced a Bill, for remedying, in a somewhat cir-
cumambagical way, the hardship sustained by the poorest ratepayers.
MR. BRIGHT made his first speech as a Minister, and was sure that
MR. Disr AELI had not intended to cause the suffering complained of.
MR. CHAMBERs re-introduced the Bill for enabling a man to marry
his sister-in-law. We shall not marry ours, because we have none, and
for other reasons, but all needless restraints on marriage are contrary
to morals and English law. Question therefore remains, is this restric-
tion needless Let us hear what Reformed Commons say.
Friday. After some good news of the New Zealand War, and of a
signal chastisement of the Poverty Bay murderers,
LoRD KIM BERLEY introduced the Government Bill for the Sup-
pression of Crime.
He said that the Dangerous Class, who number 120,000, made War
* Society, and it was now necessary for Society to make War upon
em.
The Bill is what Cant calls “un-English.” That is, it proposes to
repudiate, in certain cases, the doctrine that a man must be held inno-
cent, until proved guilty by others. It enacts that if he have been
proving himself guilty, by incurring the penalties of the law, the proof
of his subsequent innocence shall be offered by himself.
The Ticket-of-leave man may be called on, at any time, to show that
he is pursuing an honest calling, and if he cannot do this, he may be
sent back to prison for the rest of his sentence.
After a man has been twice convicted of felony, he shall be under
the eye of the police for seven years, and at any time that he cannot prove
he is engaged in an honest calling, he may be sent to prison for a year.
. So, if he haunts public places with apparently unlawful intentions, or
is found in a private house under suspicious circumstances.
If he be sentenced a third time, he shall be under surveillance for life.
And after a third conviction he shall receive no less than a seven
years' sentence.
Receivers of stolen goods, once convicted, shall, on every future
charge, have to prove their own innocence. Bad for Pawnbrokers and
Marine-Storekeepers.
Magistrates may give six months instead of one month of imprison-
ment for assaults on the police.
LoRD KIMBERLEY’s speech was an able one, and it was most favour-
ably received, LoRD SHAFTESBURY pronouncing strongly in its favour.
LoRD GREY declared it founded on right principles. LoBD CAIRNs
thought there was much that was wholesome in them. An endeavour
to send the Bill to a Select Committee was generally condemned.
MR. GLADSTONE and the Liberals have grappled boldly with one of
the great questions of the day, and (subject to the improvement of
details) the Declaration of War against Crime will be applauded by all
honest men.
The only noticeable thing in the Commons was the introduction, in
an excellent speech, by MR. Sykes, of a Bill for the protection of our
poor, harmless, beautiful, useful sea-birds from snobs and ruffians like
those lately exposed in one of Mr. Punch's pictures. -

TOO HARD UPON COLENSO.
As the Houses of Parliament are accustomed, on occasion, to vote
thanks to victorious Commanders, so might the Houses of Convocation
acknowledge the services of triumphant Defenders of the Faith. A
candidate for the honour of their reverend commendation comes forth
in the person of a learned gentleman, whose name adorns the title-page
of a work described as “Critical Letters. Letter IV. By DR. FRASER

THE PERILS OF THE STREETS.
HERE is an agreeable morsel of intelligence for folks who daily take

report :—
“The expected number of deaths by violence in the streets of London is,
in the present condition of their traffic, between 19 and 20 in five weeks; the
actual numbers registered in the five weeks of this year amount to 21 : 5 per-
sons were killed by horses, 1 by a carriage, 2 by omnibuses, 2 by cabs, 5 by
waggons or vans, and 6 by carts. What appears the work of c

ought they to be viewed as merely accidental deaths? Is it not highly

anslaughter were now and then returned P. We rather think that

It is a pleasant thought for Londoners that really one may now

thoroughfares are well nigh as deadly as a battle-field. Cabs and carts
kill people as readily as cannon-shot, and the carnage caused by van-
drivers is as great almost as that by Juggernaut itself. When to the
deaths occasioned by the “accidents” of driving we add the injuries
resulting from street-prowlers and garotters, it will be obvious that any
one who wishes for long life had better take short walks, and rare
ones, in our deadly London Streets.

CONGRESS IN CONFUSION.
THE row which took place the other day at the joint meeting of
Congress in the American House of Representatives, and increased to
such a degree of confusion that MR. SPEAKER Colfax “was finally
Bishop ColeNso's easy assumptions, in common with other sceptical writers, compelled to order the serjeant-at-arms to arrest any member obstruct-
that what is called the ' Hebrew text' contains the original
Pentateuch.”
He then proceeds to quote DR. HALLE himself, as follows:—
“It is out of the limits even of possibility for any logician to elaborate a
proof that Moses either spoke or wrote what we call Hebrew.”
If DR, HALLE has succeeded in proving that the Hebrew Pentateuch
on which Bishop ColeNso commented is not authentic, he certainly
has confuted ColeNso, and thereby deserved the thanks of Convoca-
tion, provided that he can produce, or reproduce, the genuine original.
Otherwise he will have cut the ground not only from under ColeNso,
but also from under every other commentator on Colºnso's theme.
He will thus, perhaps, be considered to have proved rather too much;
and Convocation will have to thank him, if it thanks him at all, for
less than nothing.

WE read in the Illustrated London News that—
“The meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society, held on Tuesday, was a
most successful one. There was a perfect blaze of flowers, among, wi ich, the
cyclamens, and various forms of Chinese primroses, were greatly admired.
What does this mean? Should not cyclamens and Chinese prim-

ONE GUEst, a “respectable” farmer, has been committed to prison
for three weeks at Sheffield, for selling a diseased cow for food. It is
to be hoped the fate of this Guest will be a warning to the host who
are carrying on or meditating the same rascally fraud.

WHAT CONVENTIONAL REPUTATIONS COME TO.
QH dear, oh dear, and oh dear, here's a muddle-
Alabama Convention got all in a huddle:
Though STANLEY and REVERDY o'er it did cuddle,
And swore 'twould hold water like what is called “puddle.”
There’s Johnson’s been dined ever since we first heard of it,
High-faluting, serene, has in rapture referred to it, -
Swearing all the Conventions e'er drawn but absurd to it,
And here’s UNCLE SAM won’t say never a word to it!
Here’s the Press has been blowing its trumpet o'er STANLEY-
How he’s all that’s straightforward, clear-headed, and manly—
How ne'er was diplomatist—speaking humanly—
So beyond either blunder or bungle as STANLEY |
And here we have all been consigning to blazes
Qld-fashioned diplomacy's mystºries and mazes;
And, in self-satisfaction's complacentest phrases,
Singing new-fangled open diplomacy’s praises'
Here was REVERDY JoHNson, all gushing and go a-head,
To count chickens unhatched, and e'en ask them to crow a-head;
Here was STANLEY, perfection! Nortoo quick, nor too slow-a-head;
Here was CLARENDON, after the first foul, to row-a-head
All these wonderful cooks, with their wonderful toiling,
The broth have i.º. in spoiling:
And REVERDy Johnson his slackjaw up-coiling—
May sigh “We’re small taters, I guess, the whole boiling.”
And—sorest of slaps on the face, not a doubt of it,
To the diplomates who in advance made a shout of it,
And at mutual compliments had quite a bout of it,
Here’s John BULL, like JonATHAN, glad to be out of it!
“A JEWEL FROM AN EARTHEN POT.”
George Herbert.
Even if this squalid Convent case had dragged its twenty days’ length
along to no better end than this (it has done vast good in exposing
the character of convent life), Punch could not say that the time had
3. been thrown away when occasion was given to SIR. JoHN
oLERIDGE, Solicitor-General, to say what we thus embalm for the
ages:—
“I will take the liberty, Gentlemen of the Jury, of giving you a warning

filled the seat that my Lord [C. j. Cockburn] now so . occupies, I
mean Load MANspirit—the distinction between the popularity which follows,
and the popularity which is followed after—a distinction which I earnestly
entreat you carefully and inflexibly in this case to remember.”
Those be words, SIR John, for which Mr. Punch heartily thanks
you. They point a moral which needs a good deal of pointing just
now, and which Mr. Punch, who has ever been superior to the weak-
ness condemned, begs all sensitive and high-minded men to remember

SISTERS AND WIWES.
As a Romish, Bishop can absolve a Nun from her vows by virtue of a faculty
obtained from the Pope, would it not be well to allow Nuns to make vows only on
condition of observing them, till canonically dispensed from their obligation ?
Feelings change : a Sister might get tired of celibacy: and a fact came out in the
evidence on a late trial which shows that some Sisters would make some men ex-
cellent wives. One of the witnesses deposed that she had worn her veil for ten
years; another hers for a term still longer. No doubt they both of them make
the rest of their clothes last a proportional length of time. -
Now a woman, such as one of these two Nuns, would be just the wife for a
poor philosopher who remains single because he is deterred from matrimony by
the fear of linendrapers' and milliners' bills. Such a philosopher would only throw
away money by advertising for a wife accustomed to want a new dress as seldom
as he wants a new suit. He would probably not find such a woman outside of a
convent. But now he may know that within the walls of nunneries there are ladies
who wear their veils as long as he wears his hat. If one of them could and would
but have him, she might make him as º as any philosopher in narrow, circum-
stances can be made by her who shares them. ...And almost all philosophers, are

GREAT, that you have not lost
a day ? Make known, then,
over your Julienne or à la

appeal to any, one you may
think able to alleviate the des-
titution it discloses:– .

he will make a donation to some

sation will now take a culinary

SYDNEY SMITH's receipt for salad, or DR. Johnson’s partiality for

The Fine Arts are nearly related; one introduces another. The
pleasures of the palate are in most men's mouths (one of the few things
in which womanis the inferior creature); the delights of the palette are
almost as much appreciated. Cooks are great É. artists, women
of taste, but the es who show their paintings in Conduit Street
are greater, at least asthetically (this once idolised word has been
somewhat neglected of late); so leave oil and vine for oil and
water, and touch on the pictures, and drawings, and studies in the
various Exhibitions at present open, with the air of an expert and the
mien of a judge. Next, as a suitable introduction to the politics you

For a few moments only! For WILLIAM GLAnstone will be heard
before William Tell; Migh AEL Qosta may or may not be Conductor,
but BENAMIN DISRAELI is now the Leader of a powerful band; there
is a Don Giopanni to be listened to at Westminster as well as at Čovent
Garden, and the tale of his conquests is not yet complete; there is
more than one Robert, with a Budget not likely to be quite so amusing
as Figaro; and Les Huguenots may set us a thinking of the massacre
that is impending of Bishops, and Deans, and Pastors without flocks ;
of columns—of newspapers, and divisions—in lobbies; of manoeuvres,
and tactics, and skirmishes, and general engagements; and of all the
defeats and victories in the ſº campaign, perhaps another Seven Years'

EVERYBODY who has the public interest at heart will rejoice that the
Conservative, element in the House of Commons obliged Wiscount
BURY to withdraw his motion for leave to bring in a fiſſ to repeal that
portion of the Act, 6th Queen Anne, chap. 7, which necessitates the
re-election of Members accepting office under the Crown. The main-
tenance of the law, requiring such Members to be re-elected often
occasions a contested election, which is always a good thing for the
publicans.
Two Great Works.
THE Dundee Adcertiser says that since the ugly revelations in the
É. RUMBLE case were published, information of similar mal-practices
as been pouring in on the Admiralty from all sides, and that MR BAxter,
“the indefatigable secretary,” is §§ up his time and attention to
routing out these rogues in and out of the office, at the cost of much
personal ill-will Punch can say is, Bravo, BAxTER! The Member
for Dundee is determined that his great work shall not be Barter's
Saints' Rest, but Barter's Sinners’ Disturbance.

LONG last the Law of England to govern great and small,
Within this kingdom paramount, alike for one and all,
And, with respect to persons, no distinction ever draw:
No Frince, no Priest, no Prelate here, no soul above the Law 1
Let other nations patch up their Concordats with Rome's See,
But never to such compromise do thou, JoHN BULL, agree,
Monks against monks for justice, against nuns if nuns should stand,
Be there for them the Juries still, and Judges of the Land.
Superiors in the witness-box, and Bishops too, must show,
And at their peril testify of what the Court would know;
A Cardinal could be enforced, if need were, to appear:
The Pope might be subpoena'd if his Holiness were here.
No priestly jurisdiction to suffer let us deign, . . .
But in old England evermore our English Law maintain;
That law, of human reason the perfection that would be,
Of but a few absurdities if it were only free.
A BAD PRE-EMINENCE.
MR. PUNCH for many reasons has a high esteem for Manchester.
But his esteem is not enhanced by this statement in the Times :-
“In comparison with the metropolis, it *. that in Manchester alone
more than 3000 lives are annually sacrificed to personal dirt, municipal
stupidity, and social neglect.”
The death-rate in Manchester is higher than in any other city in the
kingdom; and this, we are informed, is owing chiefly to its dirt. Death
and dirt go often hand in hand in crowded cities, and the dirtier a
place is the more deadly will it prove to be. If Manchester would send
its dirty people to the wash, the chances of longevity to the rest of its
inhabitants would doubtless be increased.

in meters, the gas-chaps cheat awfully), but the tongue of good report
hath been heard in its favour. And if there is much in it like this, he
is sure it is worth reading:—
“A family without the masculine element is something like an egg without
salt. Even if a man can do nothing else in a house, he seldom fails to
give the women about him abundant opportunities for self-denial, and so
brings out the noblest part of their nature.”.
A, very well planted hit, dear lady-author. If women habituall
fought their battles with such neat fence as this, men would not thin
that they always get the best of it, as they now do., However—ha!
ha! will the wives thank you, MRs. META. Is not the above a hint
for a good excuse for a man's dining out, and refusing an evening
party? That’s our riposte.

WOL, LVI,
CONVENTS AND CONVENTS.
WITH reference to the late Convent Case, the Paris Correspondent
of the Post says:—
“The scandals of the convents of Italy and Spain would throw your very
mild little drama into the shade. The instruments of torture employed in the
monastic establishments of Italy are more like those which may be seen in the
Tower of London, though not so terrible, I confess. I remember that
WLANELL1, a Neapolitan artist, who painted interiors of churches and con-
vents, had a collection of “discipline instruments,’ which he had contrived
from time to time to extract from convents. There were rods of fine wire,
collars of iron, heavy rings, heavy iron shoes, and some queer little things
which would puzzle you to conceive how they were applied to the body. I am
speaking of days when the civil power in Italy could not penetrate a monastic
establishment without Church permission.”
Of course there is no fear that any such articles as those above-
specified would be found, on investigation, among the lº.
utensils and apparatus of any convent in the United Kingdom. Human
nature in England, and even in Ireland, is quite another thing than
what it is in Italy; and, although clandestine letter-writing to friends
appears to be about the highest crime known to conventual law, no
. person conversant with genteel society, can possibly imagine
that, in any nunnery throughout these dominions, a Sister has ever to
suffer anything much worse than being crowned with a duster, or
having to wear a pair of boots hung round her neck. Besides, the Italian
atmosphere differs from our own; and the suggestion that any kind of
inspection of monastic establishments in this. country, is advisable,
cannot, in the true interests of civil and religious liberty, be too
promptly pooh-poohed.

to Bow Street? But which was taken up, pray—the cheer, or West-

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 1. The Great Magician began to utter the Words
of Power that, when all are said, shall set the Protestant Ariel free,
and bid her fare far better than ever. That night, the FENIAN CALIBAN
“had cramps,
Side stitches that did pen his breath up; urchins
Did for that vast of night that they might work
All exercise on him. That most lying slave,
Whom stripes might move, not kindness,”
felt that soon his occupation would be gone, or else
But to the Words. - -
. Year's Day, 1871, will see the Irish and the English Churches
severed.
But the work of Disestablishment and Disendowment is to begin on
the passing of the Bill, the Second Reading whereof stands for the
18th of this month.
Then is the present Ecclesiastical Commission for Ireland to be
wound up, and a new one formed. For the purposes now before us,
the Church is to be under two Governments, one, the State's, to last
ten }. one her Own, to last as long as the Church pleases.
The first is a fltºn Tommission, appointed by the State.
The second is a 650btrming 3300g, elected by the Church.
Ng new Wested Interests are to be created after the passing the Act,
but for the temporary government of the Church, spiritual appoint.
ments may be made.
The QUEEN loses her prerogative of appointing Bishops; but, on the
prayer of the Church, may nominate them for spiritual purposes.
The Irish Bishops at once depart from the House of Lords.
§. action is to be restored to the Irish Church, and it is invited
to elect a body which shall fairly represent bishops, priests, and laymen
of the Anglican colnmunion, and if the Government shall consider that
such body is properly representative, the QUEEN will recognise it, and it
will govern the Irish Free Episcopal Church of the future. This is the
Governing Body that has been mentioned.
To this body, which it will be convenient to call the G. B. (let us
hope the initials will also mean Great Blessing), will be set over so
much of the property of the Church as she is to retain. Careful calcu-
lations have been gone into as to the value of that property, and of the
rightful claims upon it, and it will be seen that provision is made for
the clergy of various ranks. -
Incumbents are to have their net income (less curates’ salaries) so
long as they discharge their duty. Or, if they please, the annuity
. their interest may be commuted, and handed to the G. B.,
subject to the trust of paying the income while duty is done. -
urates are divided into two sorts, the Permanent and the Transitory.
e former are to have the same provision as Incumbents; the latter
are to be dealt with as are Civil Servants.
No, aged ladies of both sexes, MR. GLADston E does not plunder the
Private Endowments, nor does he hand over the Protestant churches
to the Papists. On the contrary, every private endowment since King
CHARLEs THE Second's Restoration, (before, which MR. GLADstone
holds that the Irish Church was Calvinistic, and different from our own)
is to be religiously preserved to the G. B. These are valued at half a
million. And as for the churches, they are to be handed to the G. B.
conditionally on its keeping them in order for divine service, or under-
taking to pull them down, and build others where there are more
Protestants. And, - -
Twelve churches, which are national memorials, or objects of art, are
to be maintained by the Commission. Ruined churches, or such as are
refused by the G. B., are to be transferred to the Board of Works, to be
taken down, and the materials and the land sold.
Nor are the Protestant Church Burial Grounds, to be given up to
Popish ghouls, but are to pass with the churches, all rights reserved.
other burial-grounds ; to the Guardians of the Poor.
We disincline to trouble you about Glebe Houses and the Glebe,
lest, like ADDIsoN,-
“In the sultry glebe you faint.”
But take it from us that the proposed arrangements are very just to
the Church.
Would you like to know the value of the Public Endowments of
No. 1444.”

º Irish Church? MR. GLADstone estimates them at Sixteen
lonS.
Now, when we have said that Ecclesiastical laws and courts are
to be abolished on the passing of the Act, but that the former may be
accepted by the Church in the way of Voluntary Compact, until the
G. B. shall please to alter them, we proceed to mention that
The Grant to Maynooth (Catholic), and the Regium Donum (Presby.
terian), the former £26,000 a year, the latter about £50,000, are to be
continued for Fourteen Years. Fierce is Opposition wrath at this,
which is described as giving Maynooth £380,000, out of Protestant
money, a distinct violation of MR. GLADSTONE’s pledge. There will
be a row, especially as the gift is made permanent, instead of being at
the annually expressed will of Parliament, which might be ultra-
Protestant. - - - - - -
It is hinted, very broadly, to Trinity College, Dublin, that it will
have to be overhauled shortly.
The tithe rent-charge—but you don't understand that, my dear.
Well, never mind. It is a very important matter, affecting the land,
and MR. GLADstone has devised a plan by which the landowners can
get the charge “merged on easy terms. When the matter is fought
over in Committee, Mr. Punch will tell you as much about it as it is
good for you to know.
All the Church Lands are to be sold, and the present tenant is to
have the refusal of his portion, and if he likes to buy he is to be helped
with a loan of three-quarters of the money, to be repaid by instal-
ments.
§. º of the Irish Church is calculated at £700,000 a year.
ow then,
M% the Enormous Sum which has to be dealt with, the Sixteen
lillons.
Eight Millions and a half is to go back to the Church, for the pur-
poses which have been mentioned.
There will be upwards of Seven Millions and a half for MR; GLAp-
º º fleal with, and as a delightful writer says, “What will he do
with it * *
We'll tell you what he will not do with it.
It is not to go to any Church.
Not for any teaching of religion.
Not for Education, or we should soon be in quarrel.
Not for public works, for the Irish would “ jºb." and "scramble,”
and besides, the arrangement would not be final.
Not for railways, for similar reasons. - - -
But the application should bear Legible Marks of a Christian
character. Therefore,
Let us * the money in aid of that region of want and suffering
which lies between the independent part of the population, and the
purely pauperised population, the region where the Poor Laws work
not.
Let us first, and most . provide for 3Lumatics.
[Here Mr. Punch interpolateth, at his sweet will, a note. What did
DEAN Swift write.} That he, too, would give the surplus of his pro-
perty in the same direction, in Ireland. Wide Cartoon. He said:–
** He left the little wealth he had
To build a house for fools or mad
To show, by one satiric touch,
No Nation wanted it so much.”]
The other objects of aid are to be the Deaf and Dumb, and the
Blind, the Training of Nurses, Reformatories, Industrial Schools, and
Infirmaries.
Surely the Christian character is, as Milton says, “writ large” there.
Such is the Magician's scheme. It was expounded in a speech of
three hours, a speech in which an artist, whose praise is worth having,
MR. DISRAELI, “willingly admitted that there was not a phrase too
much.” That its lucid order should surpass that with which Mr. Punch
has presented the plan is not in the nature of things, but, Mr. Punch
willingly admits that his own lucidity was paralleled. And though he
seldom stoops from epigram to eloquence, he can cordially admire
the glowing words, which sent, argument home to the heart, and on
this occasion he will immortalise an orator's peroration. It will be
historical. As regarded the Irish Church, he said,
“I venture to believe that when, instead of that fictitious position in which
we have too long bolstered up the Irish Establishment, it is called on to trust
to its own resources, to its sacred mission, to all that it can draw from its
ministers and members, and all the high hopes of the Gospel which it teaches,
it will find that it has entered upon a new era of its existence, an era bright
with promise and instinct with life.”
And thus he concluded, nobly:—
“The credit and power of this assembly are involved. This assembly,
which has inherited long ages of accumulated honour, in numberless trials of
#. legislation, is now called upon to address itself to a task which would
ave demanded the best energies of the best of our fathers and ancestors. I
believe it will prove itself worthy of the task. Should it fail, even the fame
of this assembly will suffer disparagement; should it succeed, its fame will
receive no small or insensible addition. . . . We are sanguine of the

issue. We know the controversy is near its end, and for my part I may
say I am deeply convinced that when the day of final consummation shall
send forth the words that give the force of law to this work of peace and
justice, those words will be echoed from every shore where the names of
Ireland and of Great Britain are known, and that the answer will come back
in the approving verdict of civilised mankind.”
MR, DISRAELI said that his side had not changed its opinions, but
looked on the Disestablishment as a grave political error, and upon
Disendowment, ºp; for secular purposes, as Confiscation. He
bore the tribute Punch has cited, and would not oppose the introduc-
tion of the Bill... But notice has since been given that on the 18th he
will move that the Bill be read a Second Time that day six months.
So we are to have battle.
With such a Whale in the offing, we have no care for the little
fishes. , Those who like to catch them can. Brazil is thought to have
ended her Slave Trade, so we are to abolish our high-handed Act under
which we seize slayeships in her waters. MR. FAwcETT, against re-
monstrances, persisted in getting himself beaten on the proposal to
throw hustings expenses on rates, a new Member gracing his maiden
speech with mentioning that one of his constituents had declared he
would see him D before he’d pay such a charge. A London Tramways
Bill was read a Second Time by a ºf majority. MR. ToM Hugh Es’s
Sunday Trading Bill is to be referred to a Committee. Another Com:
mittee is to consider the means of promoting purity at Elections, and
the Home SECRETARY declared himself a convert to the Ballot.
But the pleasantest hearing was MR. Lowe's announcement that the
Abyssinian Expedition, which was warranted to cost us only Five
Millions, will certainly have cost us Eight and a half, and probably
more. There are prettier things in the South Kensington \ſ.
than those crowns and robes, and things that have cost a deal less.
The Bill for dealing, not gently, with gentle BILL SIKEs, has been
read twice by the Lords. The Čommons heard foºd F.'dººm on
adulterations and bad measures, but were persuaded by MR. Poch IN
and MR. BRIGHT that these are small grievances, that tradesmen cheat
themselves as often as their customers, and that the adulterations are
rather beneficial than not; so the poorer class are still to be victimised.
The Bill against the snobs and ruffians who murder the poor sea-birds
made progress, and a Bankruptcy Bill has been introduced, based on
the Scotch system, which allows those who understand a debtor's case,
and are most interested in his prosperity, to manage his affairs in their
own way. MR. HENRY JAMES has turned out SERJEANT Cox, and is
the able Member for Taunton.
WHAT SCIENCE SAYS OF US.
STALE enough is the old story how a fishwoman was put into a rage
by being called a parallelogram. But though hard words break no
bones, there are few of us who relish them. Where, for instance, is

fact, is nothing more than a mere protoplasm f Yet any one who reads
PROFEssoR Huxley's recent paper will find that this is how a man
ought to be designated. If folks were all as learned as the erudite
Professor, what curious remarks might be dropped about a dinner-

MR. TED NIPPER, the FUNNY DoG, is what is called in society an
Acquisition. He is formed by mature for a drawing-room low comedian,
and possesses certain advantages over the professional Droll, inasmuch
as, to see the latter, you must suit his convenience, not your own,
while the former comes to you at your own time and place. “Therein,”
as WAGG would say, who follows the FUNNY Dog, “lies the difference
between the former and the latter, or rather, the former and the
per-former.” But then WAGG is such a feilon/
WAGG (while I am on the subject) is not equal to NIPPER, that
is, in society’s opinion, though in reality little WAGG is original and
NIPPER is not ; moreover he says clever things, which is *:::: beyond
NIPPER, who is simply a Droll. Sometimes they are asked tº a party
together, when NIPPER, in conversation at the dinner-table, is utterly
snuffed out by WAGG, and is, so to speak, nowhere. In fact, on this
occasion, but for the justice he does to the dishes and drinks, NIPPER
might as well be under the table as at it. He seldom ventures upon a
passage of arms with WAGG without being º shut up and dis-
comfited; when, with much tact, he joins the laugh against himself,
and gives such a comical roll of his eyes, and such a funny little abrupt
cough, by way of an aside, as puts. WAGG's witty repartee out of every
one's mind, and sets them laughing at and with NIPPER. NIPPER
professes much friendly feeling for WAGG, and secretly envies him his
talent. WAGG affects to patronise NIPPER, whom he treats as a hope-
less buffoon.
“How d'ye do?” says MR. NIPPER to MR. WAGG one day. At
which funny speech his admirers went into shrieks of laughter. “For
you see,” as j. giggler HYANER explained to me, “it’s not so much
what he says, but the way he says it; ” in which observation I perfectly
concurred.
When the FUNNY DoG gave utterance to the above memorable
speech, he accompanied it with a shrug of the shoulders, a closing of
the eyes, and a pursed-up smile which increased the merriment of his
audience. He can't even say the most commonplace thing without
some drollery of this sort.
“Hallo! Jack PUDDING,” replied MR. WAGG, “what a pity it is
old W1DDIcoxib isn’t alive: you’d have made a fortune Wilſ him as
the Clown at Astley's. I wonder you don’t take to a Circus now * *
Whereat MR. NiPPER was very much annoyed, as he informed me
afterwards, privately; but at the moment all he did was to imitate a
Clown in a Circus, asking MR. WAGG whether there was “anything
he could go for to fetch for to carry for to bring,” and other conven-
tional funniments of the Circus level. M.R. HYANER at this was in
ells of laughter again, and as for Miss CATTERINE CHESSER (a young
dy who is always, according to her own account, either “shrieking ”
or “screaming” with exuberant merriment), she fairly “went off” in a
high giggling key, and begged MR, NIPPER, in an exhausted voice
from behind a small pocket-handkerchief, “not to be so very absurd.”
The FUNNY Dog was much hurt by WAGG’s expressed opinion of him
as a buffoon.
“Hang it !” he says to his intimate friends, “I’m not a buffoon,
am l?” His tone is so piteous that you can’t find it in your heart to
tell him that WAGG isn’t far wrong, even if not entirely right. So
NIPPER's friend, probably MARSH ToADIE, replies,
“Buffoon, my dear fellow, of course not. You’re a deuced good
actor, and WAGG’s jealous. It was only for the sake of saying a smart
thing before Miss Chess ER.”
“Yes,” says the FUNNY Dog, not much relishing this last remark;
“but it wasn't a very smart thing to call me a buffoon.”
“Bah, my dear boy,” returns i. “Johnson called GARRick a
buffoon; but that didn’t make him one, eh?”
“No, of course not,” says the poor FUNNY Dog, quite brightening
up at this portrait of himself as GARRICK. Henceforth he adopts this
argument as his own, and when WAGG repeats his offence, NIPPER is
down upon him with the example of Johnson.
“What Johnson P’’ asks WAGG. “BEN or SAM P’’
“Eh P’’ says poor NIPPER, taken aback; for his memory is bad, and
his acquaintance with literary history, or any history, worse.
“BEN or SAM * repeats the inexorable WAGG, adding,
“Under which king, Bezonian, speak or die?”
There is only one way for the unfortunate NIPPER out of the diffi-
culty. If he shows, before an admiring crowd too (“That’s the worst
of WAGG,” he complains; “always says these things before a crowd—
such nonsense, you know”), ignorance of GARRICK!, BEN and SAM,
his reputation will receive an injury from which it will be difficult tº
recover; for he is supposed to know all about the Drama, past and
present, and generally to be a very clever fellow. So, when WAGG
repeats “BEN or SAM,” the FUNNY Dog takes refuge in the assump-
tion of a hoarse voice, supposed to belong to the traditional peep-
|
showman, with whose celebrated speech he now parries WAGG’s
searching inquiry. -
“Wichever you like, my little dear,” says NIPPER, in the character
just . “You pays your money, and you takes your chice.”
His admirers describe this as “doosed clever of |NIPPER,” and “a
regular shut-up for WAGG.” But the FUNNY DoG is P. aWare
that he has had to defend himself against the charge of buffoonery by
º on the cap and bells, and begging for quarter at his adversary's
and, in the character of an idiot. Čailing upon him next day I was
enabled to follow the course of his studies since the encounter of the
º evening, by his ingenuous remark to me, that, “It was odd,
ut he never knew, or rather, had never noticed till to-day, that
Ben Jonson spelt his name without an H.” He had also been
looking out GARRICK's date and contemporaries, for Boswell's Life
was lying on the table. - -
WAGG is a performing dog in his own way, but in a totally different
line, as you perceive, from NIPPER's.
There is also ALF PooDEL, who belongs to the category of Funny
Dogs. But he is only an inferior Nipper, with puns added of the worst
description possible. PooDEL, like the marmalade in the advertise-
ments, is “an excellent substitute for” NIPPER, at dinner, or at
amateur theatricals. PooDEL is, in fact, the second low comedian, and
if PooDEL and NIPPER have both to perform in a piece, to NIPPER is
given the choice of parts, and Poodel, takes what he can get and
makes the most of it—if he can. -
As to his personal appearance, the Funny Dog is short—all funny
dogs are. I only remember one exception, and he was a Grotesque of
over six feet high, which was somehow funny in itself, as a sort of
exaggerated caricature. In fact this comic monster was NIPPER seen
through a magnifying glass of immense power. Do my readers recol-
lect the shout of laughter which used to greet the appearance of the
magnified lecturer, focussed on to the dissolving-view white sheet at
the Polytechnic, where he used to open his cavern, of a mouth, to eat a
penny, or as it then appeared a two-and-sixpenny, bun ? Well, if they
do, that will give them some idea of the cumbersome tall Droll, at
whom no one could help langhing when he opened his mouth; that is,
if it wasn’t to say anything. -
Nipper is inclined to podginess. PooDEL is more sketchy, NIPPER
belongs to the Grimaldi order of clown; PooDEL to the tumbling.
The FUNNY Dog is not only funny in himself, but is the cause of
attempts at fun in others. Thus the gravest men meeting NIPPER
will # it incumbent upon them to assume a manner totally at
variance with their known character, much in the same way as we
accommodate our conversation to the infantile style when we visit a
friend's nursery.
This, by the way, is a source of as great annoyance to the FUNNY
DoG as being stigmatised as a Buffoon by WAGG.
A Chancery Barrister, at whose house NIPPER has been very hº
in a Buckstonian character, in some recent, theatricals, meets him
º the street. The Barrister is middle-aged, ordinarily grave and
SO16 mil.
He sees NIPPER. In a second that grave man forces himself to be
jocose and practically funny. . He exclaims, “Ha, Mr. Bor !”, which
is the character he has taken in that classic work, and favours him with
(as he thinks) a º imitation. -
“How do you do?” returns Nipper, severely, by way of reproving
the 9. man for attempting to interfere with his (the FUNNY
Dog's) peculiar line. -
“Been acting lately?” asks the Barrister.
“No!” returns NiPPER, carelessly, “not much;” though the fellow
knows he has been performing every night, and is full of engagements.
“Aha!” says his friend, “we must have some more theatricals
soon. We’ll do a farce for you and me. , I’ll play whatever you like.
How you made my wife laugh! She can't get it out of her head. I
never saw anything so absurd as you were in that white hat. Ha!
Ha! Ha!” And the worthy Lawyer goes off into a roar (all by way
of compliment) at the bare recollection.
The FUNNY Dog despises him for laughing at such nonsense, and
feels annoyed at his reminding him of having made a fool of himself.
He complains to a friend. “Why,” he says, “can't he ” (referring
to the Chancery man) “speak to me sensibly. I don't want every one
to come up with a caper and a grin. . It’s abominably annoying. I
think I º cut farces, and play nothing but serious parts. Serious
with a dash of sentiment in them. "Pon my word,” he goes on bitterly,
“people seem to think that I’m always going about, with a white hat,
and hiding in a cupboard, or sitting on somebody's bonnet in a band-
box. Idiots!” - -
But really and truly so he is. He was born for it; and is never
funnier than when he is seriously annoyed.

A STORM IN A TEA-CUP.
THERE is now a war in print about the right to write books in which
all the words shall be like these; that is to say, all short, for small folks.
One of the soft sex is quite hard on some ones of the hard sex, and
says that they have not kept faith with her as to some books which she
said she would write, and which they have told two new scribes to do
in this small way, for kids. It does not seem a great feat for any he or
she, nor, as there is not a nice nurse who does not write out nice tales
in this way for the dears in her charge, does the fight seem, to be a
grand one, and the rage of the dame makes Punch laugh in his snug
way. Shé says that she has writ, or wants to write thus some books
which she names, but how the juice she means to do it is a nut which
we fail to crack, as one of the books is the Swiss Family Robinson, and one
more is the Eeenings at Home; but we guess that she will call the first
the Swiss Kin of Sons of Bob, and the next Nights not spent Out of the
House. Sure there is not much here that should make grown up folks
snarl and scold; but we are glad of fun, and we thank our friend who
prints the fight in his aesthetical hebdomadal publication, denominated
the Athenaeum.
A WAVE OF OUR BATON.
THE word Star rather crops up3. now. There’s MRs. STAR in the
Convent Case, but we’ve happily done with that, and can leave its lesson
to soak into the minds of Priests, Women, and Families. Then there's
the Transit of Venus, classically called a º; or planet.
Then there’s Miss StARR, the artist, for whose sake Mr. Punch writes
this paragraph, to note that in a graceful and appreciative notice of
some Art-works, in the Pall Mall Gazette, the critic “assumes” that
young lady “to be a student,” and for the moment forgets that, she
was a student, certainly, who took the Gold Medal for about as bold
and fine a work as the Academy has often guerdoned. As Herald to
the Nobility of Art, Punch, King-at-Arms, insists on having the pro-
cession to the temple of fame duly marshalled.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO FEED OUR GAOL-BIRDS.
To live “like a fighting cock” is generally conceived as an agreeable
existence. But it can hardly be agreeable to live like common poultry,
at least if one be fattened in the way they are at Vichy:-
“A large circular building, admirably ventilated, and with the light par-
tially excluded, is fitted
up with circular cages,
in tiers rotating on a
central axis, and ca-
º: of being elevated,
epressed, or rotated,
which are so arranged
that each bird has, as
it were, a separate stall,
containing a perch.
The birds are placed
with their tails con-
verging to a common
centre, while the head
of each may be brought
in front by a simple
rotatory movement of
the central axis. Each
bird is fastened to its
cell by leathern fetters,
which prevent move-
ment except of the head
and wings, without
occasioning pain.”
To live strapped up
in a cage can scarcely
be regarded as a
º: way of
passing into pungul-
tude; and one would
think that even birds
would become ex-
tremely bilious when
deprived of means of
exercise, and daily
stuffed with food in
the manner here de-
picted:—
“When the feeding
time comes the bird is
enveloped in a wooden
case, from which the
head and neck alone
appear, and which is
popularly known as its
paletot, by which means
all unnecessary strug-
gling is avoided. The
attendant (a young girl)
seizes the head in her
left hand, and gently
presses the beak, in
order to open it; then,
with her right, she
introduces into the
gullet a tin tube about
the size of a finger.
This tube is united to
a flexible pipe, which
communicates with the
dish in which the food
has been placed, and
from which the desired
quantity is instantly
injecte into the
stomach.”
“I would I were a
bird!” is one of the
last wishes this des-
cription would excite,
if one has any taste
for º good
dinner. hat
a
punishment it would be for an alderman, for instance, to be fastened in
a wooden case, and forced to sit bolt upright, with a tin tube down his
throat, and so be crammed with turtle soup, without the power of
as poultry are at Vichy.

LONDON CHARIVARI. [MARCH 13, 1869.
PUNCH, OR THE
THE SIBYLLINE BOOKS.
TARQUINIUs the Tyrant,
In purple and in pall,
Sat in his chair of ivory
Before the Senate-hall,
Watching the busy toilers
That crowded Tiber's strand,
Hewing beam, and squaring marble,
For the temple he had planned.
When sudden came a dark’ning
Of the bright sun in the sky,
And TARQUINIUs looked heavenward,
But nothing could he spy;
No eagles on the left hand,
No eagles on the right;
Presaging good or evil, . .
By the manner of their flight.
But still the day grew darker,
Though no cloud was to be seen;
And there fell an awful shadow,
The King and folk between.
And it deepened to the blackness
Of a summer thunder-cloud,
That clove, and gave a passage
To a woman bent and bowed.
O'er a forehead, carved with wrinkles,
felia forelock thin and hoar,
And in her lean arms gathered
Nine rolls of books she bore.
And her robe against the darkness
Shone white, as she stood there,
Confronting, with no reverence,
The monarch in his chair.
She looked; her glance took all things
Around, before, behind;
She spoke : her voice seemed distant,
Like a far-off ocean wind.
“These mine books hold the wisdom
Of the Sibyl; I am she
From Cumae. I have journeyed,
By the sunny southern sea.
“All Apollo hath revealed me,
All the wisdom and the wit
That the sun-god's love hath quickened,
In these nine books is writ.
Therein all public evils,
And therein all their cures;
Which the State that heeds not, falleth,
And the State that heeds, endures.
“These nine books, oh TARQUINIUS,
Shall unto thee be sold,
For a talent of white silver,
And a talent of red gold;
But all the sand Pactolus
E’er swept down to the main,
Were little to the value
Of what these books contain.”
All scornful sat TARQUINIUs;
For the cloud had pass'd away :
And his heart within was hardened,
And he said the Sibyl nay.
But scarce the word was spoken,
When the great cloud fell once more :
And the place where stood the Sibyl
Was empty as before.
Then TARQUINIUs felt a pricking
In his heart, and wished, within,
He had ta'en the woman's proffer,
So those nine books to win.
And scarce the wish was shapen,
When again the crone was there,
White robed against the darkness,
Before the ivory chair.
“Again, oh King, I am with thee,
For thy unbreathed wish I heard:
Without ears 'tis mine to hear
What is spoken without word.
Again my books I offer,
ut three no more are mine;
And the same price thou shalt pay me,
For the six as for the nine.”
Then scornful laughed TARQUINIUS,
And his heart was like a stone :
“To pay the price of nine for six,
For fool were to be known.”
Then again the woman vanished,
Like a cloud into the cloud,
And the King wished he had closed with her,
But spoke it not aloud.
When, lo, as on his wishing,
Stood the Sibyl at his knee.
“Again my books, I proffer :
But the six are fall'n to three.”
Again my books I offer,
And again their price I fix;
And the same price thou shalt pay me
For the three as for the six.”
Then TARQUINIUs was astonished,
And the Augurs' counsel prayed :
And they said he had done evil
That with evil would be paid :
For the Gods had brought him wisdom,
But their purpose he had crossed
And now of that deep knowledge
Six books of nine were lost.
So the red gold and white silver
Were paid by tale and weight,
And the Sibyl's books were garnered,
And guarded by the State,
Locked in the sacred Capitol,
Shut in a chest of stone,
And two seers to guard and search them,
And make their wisdom known
Then let England think of TARQUIN,
How the oftener he said may,
Still the Sibyl's booksF. fewer,
And the same he had to pay,
For less knowledge of the evil,
And less knowledge of the cure,
By one of which States perish,
And by one of which, endure.
When Ireland's cloud lay blackest,
And Pitt, our Sibyl, came
With a plan to pay the priesthood,
And spoil Sedition's game,
His wisdom was rejected,
And the nine books came no more;
And the black cloud lay still blacker
Round the Green Isle's weeping shore.
Now GLADSTONE stands for Sibyl,
With six books instead of nine,
And offers a worse bargain
Than Pitt's in ninety-nine.
And if we spurn this offer,
The six books will shrink to three,
And less profit we shall *
And more the price will be
A Nice Place.

TERRIFIC APPARITION
SEEN DURING THE RECENT Fog At WESTMINstER.
GULLS BY SEA AND LAND.
WHEN we’re drawing a Bill to save sea-birds—
Whose suff’rings no doubt deserve pity—
Why don't some one bring in a Bill
For protecting the Gulls in the City ?
These poor Gulls are just as much shot at,
Plucked as bare of their plumes, though they go
Not to deck ladies’ hats, but line pockets
Of PROJECTOR, DIRECTOR, & Co.
You will find just as many lame ducks,
As many poor geese who have bled,
Limping sadly around Capel Court,
As you’ll find about Flamborough Head.
And in both city-court, and sea-crag,
While fish swim, and shares rise and fall,
You will find hungry Cormorants watching,
Who find no prey too great or too small.
Above all you’ll discover that puffin'
Has an equal attraction for most
Who follow their game in the City,
As for snobs who hit fowl on the Coast.
If 'tis well to protect sea-gulls' eggs, -
Why leave land-gulls' eggs, let me ask it—
Whose produce was counted ere hatched,
To be smashed, often, all in one basket 2
If we think it our duty to shelter
Young sea- unable to fly,
Why let unfledged land-gulls risk necks,
On paper-wings soaring sky-high *
If a “close”-time for sea-gulls is fixed,
When 'tis penal the creatures to “pot,”
What a blessing a “close”-time would be,
That would keep Land-Gulls safe out of shot
The land-gulls “close”-time to begin,
Like that of the sea-gulls-let’s say—
From that highly appropriate date
Of April the first-All Fools' Day!
"PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MARCH 8, Monday. The Lords fixed their holidays. They agreed
to rise on Friday, the 19th instant, and meet again on Monday, the
5th April. The intervening time Punch supposes that they will expend
in talking, about the Boat Race, and the arguments against the f.
Church Bill. The water coaches will have done their work splendidly,
but how far MR. DisRAELI will succeed into coaching his men to pull
together, and not catch crabs, is another matter.
One has not heard much of Oriel College, Oxford, lately. In old
days there was a capital parody on Roderich %ch Alpin Dhu, wherein
that hero, transformed into a Don, who had fallen in love with Miss
ELLEN Douglas, says,
“Thank Heaven, there's one man whom I don't see about her,
Her townsman, the tutor of Oriel, Fitzjames,
For though of the two I am somewhat the stouter,
His legs are far neater, much older his claims.
Look on this tutor true,
ELLEN, for love of you,
Just metamorphosed from blacksmith to beau,
Hair combed and breeches new,
... Grace-altered Roderich Dhu,
While every gownsman cries, wondering, Ho! ho!”
But now there is a Bill for enabling a layman to be appointed to the
Provostship of Oriel. LoRD DERby, Chancellor, does not object to
this, but to the way in which a lay provostship is to be endowed. e
matter does not seem to concern the entire universe, and Mr. Punch
would hardly have mentioned it but for the sake of displaying the
magnificent memory that can bear in mind a squib which he read forty
years ago.
Lord Russell made a sensible speech, urging a general system of
§. education, and LQRD SALisbury could not see any connection
tween the diminution of crime and the increase of education. Crime
was a matter of moral depravity, and no teaching would make a
criminal depart from his original bias. The way to diminish crime was
to diminish poverty. As thus boldly and baldly put, the Marquis's
WOL. LWI. M
p. may shock, but it is not to be dismissed with a jeer. The
Bishop of Losdos knew better than to jeer, but he reproduced the

Coffin Squadron, that of the West Coast of Africa, has been reduced,
and is to be kept on foot only for the purposes of trade. This nºte does
not mean that he thinks, as many well-informed persons do, that the
Brazil is on the West Coast of Africa, quite the reverse, it is on the
East Coast of South America, unless there has been any alteration.
MR. CHILDERs moved the Navy Estimates. There is a reduction of

Tuesday. The DUKE of SoMERSET pitched into the Missionaries in
China, who are º getting into scrapes, and calling in armed force
to help them out. Of course, a * sea-officer is delighted to be
asked to let fly at the Chinese, and then a complication occurs.
Missionaries were either rogues or enthusiasts, and it was no use
talking to them, they must be forbidden to do mischief. This is
coarsely put, but there is truth in it. The Missionary is not a man of
the world, he believes that anybody who cannot see the truth of what
is . at the Baptist or Independent College must be a fool, and
therefore incontinently brays him in a mortar. Some folks don't like

Let each candidate issue an address, and let the returning officer fix
the day of poll, on which every public-house should be shut up. The

the selection of representatives, and the man who cannot walk up to

MR. WHITE, who talked loudly on a º: Admiralty grievance,

MR. CARDweLL moved the Army Estimates. There is a reduction of
above a Million.
Hypothec. Ha! Have you, in compliance with Mr. Punch's gracious
invitation, found out what that means yet? If not, he regrets it,
as there was a most interesting debate on the subject in the House of
Lords to-night. If you have found out, of course there is no necessity
for his saying anything in the way of explanation. The matter is really
very jº and *Hººk
. A Bill to amend the Law of Bankruptcy in Ireland was brought
in. DR. MoRIARTY, one of the Popish Bishops, has written a letter
upon the Irish Church Bill, and affects to think that its result will be
bankruptcy among the married clergy. The letter is a coarse and
vulgar one; and the real character of the Irish priest is revealed in
that of the clown who affects to regret the prospect of seeing “a
married parson out at heels and elbows, with a lean wife and naked
children.” This scoff at a fellow-clergyman is so characteristic of
the pººl of the Affectionate People, that Punch notes it only in
proof of the venomous hate entertained by the Affectionate People s
priests—first, for Protestants; secondly, for Marriage. . . However,
a moralist would prefer that a clergyman should be subject to the
§ influences of home affections (even if they involve hard self-
enial) than that he should be the full-fed leering roysterer, with a
double entendre, ever ready on his tongue, and absolution for every
crime except submission to law. Some of the exuberant zeal of the
Irish parsons may have amused us in other days, but we never insulted
them by placing them in the same category as the clownish agitators
and vulgar libertines who have never taken one step to put down agra-

THE CHARITY OF THE STAGE.
IT is a weakness with some preachers to throw hard words at the
stage; but though there may be sermons in stones, it is rarely wise to
throw stones in a sermon. Charity covereth a multitude of sins, and,
whatever else they may be, actors certainly are charitable. No sooner
do theatrical calamities occur, than help is given liberally by those who
live by acting. To poor players time is money, as it is to other
workers; yet they never grudge their time in a charitable performance.
Hard-worked as they are, half the best actors in London played at
Drury Lane last Thursday, to help the sufferers by a fire last month at
the Hull theatre; and all who wish to aid in a work of real charity
ought now to go the Hull hog in sending in their cheques.
Prophecy for Wednesday.
WE have carefully considered all the chances of the Water Derby,
weighed each man, examined him as to his teeth and his catechism, the
ages of his father and grandfather, and his opinion, of the Digamma
and paté de foies gras. And on mature reflection, we have no hesitation
in saying that both Oxford and Cambridge will show themselves worthy
of their renown, but that the colour of the winner will be
BLUE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SENTIMENTALIST ON SEA AND LAND BIRDS.
HERE is nothing of a character more
contrary to that of BILL SIKEs than
the Bill for the Preservation of Sea-
birds, which MR.SYKEs has brought
into the House of Commons. It is a
ity that this measure cannot be en-
arged so that land-birds also shall
be brought within its purview. For
the benefit of agriculture there ought
to be fixed a period, namely, the
whole of breeding-time, during which
small birds shall be out of season as
well as game, so that the operations
of sparrow-clubs shall be temporary,
like those of goose-clubs. It may
be remarked that, at present, the
- - sparrow-clubs are goose-clubs in a
sense other than that in which the goose-clubs are so called ; that is
to say, they are composed of geese, stupid clowns, who know not
that sparrows eat up much more mischief, in eating caterpillars, than
all they do to the farmer in eating corn,
Natural history may be a thing of no consequence. If so, an
demand for the preservation of its objects, as such, is of course absur
à. to this view, there is no reason why any limit should be
prescribed to the employment of gamekeepers in destroying all varieties
of the British fauna which they account vermin. But on the opposite
supposition, which supports the British Museum, and also the Zoolo-
É Gardens, in as far as that rendezvous is also a scientific institution,
ites, buzzards, hawks, ravens, crows, magpies, and even badgers,
stoats, and weasels, ought not to be suffered to be, as they are in swift
course of being, exterminated. As to a kite, nobody ever sees one
now, except that flown by a schoolboy, or a gentleman in difficulties, or
a rogue in ordinary circumstances. these ornaments of our wilds
and our landscapes are doomed to disappear and perish, for the sake of
saving a few head of game. This is a sentimental complaint, is it?
Very well: , Say it is all bosh. Then zoology, apart from its physical
uses, is all bosh too, and so is botany.
Åbolish the fauna and the flora too. Improve all the beauty of the
earth off the face of it; do as much for the water—and throw out
MR, SYKes's Bill? No. MR. SYKEs has informed the House that the
sea-birds follow the plough, picking up worms and grubs, that they
give merchant-sailors warning of rocks, and tell deep-sea fishermen
where to cast their nets. Therefore protect these gulls, and puffins,
and cormorants, and terns, and the rest; but only because they do a
considerable deal of that material good which is now generally pursued
as the summum bonum, to the progressive disfigurement and defacement
of these dominions.
MADAME RACHEL’S LAST APPEARANCE.
MADAME, RAGHFI's house, furniture, and effects, have come to the
hammer. The lady's business having been knocked down by the
Judges, her effects are about to be knocked down by the auctioneer.
The catalogue and sale bills are quite overpowering to the imagination,
The drawing-rooms and principal apartments, are said to “present
splendour and magnificence difficult to describe.” There are cande-
labra (brass and lacquer probably), formerly belonging to the EMPEROR
NAPOLEON, and incense-burners once the property of the KING OF
DELHI '. “Dispersed through the house are numerous works of Art
and articles of virtu, many of them presentations from MADAME
RACHEL's distinguished patronesses.”
Let us hope the works of Art include choice specimens of MADAME's
own, face-painting, and that the articles of virtu left in MADAME's
hands by her distinguished patronesses have not been cracked or other-
wise damaged.

THE OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE BOAT-RACE.
THIS DAY 1 1
I was asked to make one in a Drag and see the Great University
Aquatic Contest, and I said I would. I was asked to ride with some-
body else along the Bank, and I said I would.
I was asked to walk with a companion also, along the bank, and I
believe I promised him faithfully that I would be with him at mid-day.
I hope he has not waited for me.
I was invited to go on board a steamer, and see the race from a
addle-box. I said that was what. I should enjoy above everything.
'ickets a guinea, I think, including the chance of falling into the
water, and not returning to Town.
I was invited to go in a Hansom Cab. I said I was sure this would
be delicious, if fine. Share of expense one pound five. At the last
moment I thought I wouldn’t.
I was invited to five breakfast parties on the eventful Wednesday
Morning; and last night I was at two Supper Parties after meeting
the givers of those Entertainments at the Venerable PADDY GREEN's,
ºil. the Gentlemen from our Two Seats of Learning do generally,
on this annual occasion, betake themselves.
I was not therefore at home in bed until the daylight—(“It’s my
daylight on a shiny night,” was the last chorus we sang at SMITHSON's,
with three cheers for the Light Blue, having previously at my other
supper party joined in “They are Jolly Good Fellows,”—meaning the
Oxonians—with three cheers, equally hearty, for the Dark Blue)—
until the daylight, as, I was saying, did appear, which it did this
morning considerably before its time, I am sure: a fact, by the way,
which iſ recommend to the notice of the Astronomer-Royal and the
Authorities (if any) of the Greenwich Observatory.
Having made this a holiday with a view to having a “ day out,” my
landlady had not, had notice to call me at any particular hour, and
therefore left it alone entirely, I suppose, as it was nearly one o'clock
before I awoke.
Then came the debate, in bed, as to how I should see the race.
This took at least half-an-hour; and finally I arrived at the conclusion
that I should get into hot water with most of my friends with whom I
had failed to keep my appointments. -
The mention of hot water *:::::: the idea of the preliminary step
so necessary to going out at all; and so I rang the bell, and having
ordered my hot water, consulted my watch, considered how long it
would take me to go to Putney; how uncomfortable it would be when
I got there; how I hated a crowd, and how my appearance there, if
detected by my friends, would lead to the necessity of a variety of
explanations, I determined upon having the race in my own room
before the fire, where I could see it at my leisure in my dressing-gown
and, with a pipe of much peace in my mouth, without the trouble of
putting on, to say the least of it, my boots. -
I stood, then, on the top of a drag drawn by four greys, with cham-
agne, game pies, and Qur party equally divided into light and dark
lue: mine was a light blue with fair hair, with whom I betted gloves
on the event, and knew my fate whatever happened. -
We are to see them finish. Cheers and huzzas in the distance grow
louder and louder, and we are all excitement. My Light Blue thinks
it dangerous to stand on the top of the drag, and I show her that, if
you are well guarded by an arm, no danger need be apprehended.
Oxford is seen in the distance through her glasses: for me I see ;
Light Blue. If Oxford sees her, it will put on a spurt and win. Dar
Blue is going well forward, and the boat's nose—, But what to me
is the boat's nose—I see no nose but Light Blue's, shaded by the hand
that, holds the race-glasses. Hoarse, shouts from the bank, “Now
you’re winning !” I Am I? “Go it, Cambridge 1. “Now then,
Oxford l’” “Now for a spurt 1" Jostling, trampling, scrambling,
shouting, clutching, splashing, on comes the crowd. f hear them;
but my eyes are on Light Blue. Oxford presses, Cambridge, closely.
I am Oxford for the moment, Light Blue is Cambridge. hat do I
care about races? Now they’re winning ! A loud cheer: a bang, a
clang of bells.

Yes, I will call on her to-morrow. This afternoon I will walk down
to the Club, and see which has won the University Boat Race of
Eighteen Hundred and Sixty-Nine.

ATHLETICS AT THE UNIVERSITIES:
IN consequence of the increasing preference now given to the study
of Athletics in the University, we may shortly expect vast changes in
the ancient systems hitherto existing in our two great seats of learning.
Latin will be nowhere, Leaping everything; Geometry will yield to
Gymnastics; Philosophy to Fencing; PALEY to Pole-jumping; HomeR
to Hurdles; Co-sines to Calisthenics; Trigonometry to Training; and
we shall probably hear, in the course of time, of some such changes as
the following being made in the Oxford and Cambridge curriculum:—
LITTLE Go-The Preliminary Examination. Candidates will be
examined in Fistiana, Chap. I. to VI, and will be expected to give the
Examiners practical illustrations: e.g. Let C be a circle; it will be
required to describe in it three rounds and a square.
Ertracts from Questions.—l. Explain the terms, Nut; Potatoe-trap;
Knowledge-box; Mawley; A Mouse.
2. What do you understand by the Upper cut? Practical illustration
necessary. If the Examiner is floored, the Student will receive full marks.
3. How and when is the Sponge thrown up
The Flat Race.—l. Explain the terms, Lap; Sprint race; the Lead;
Waiting on some one; Easy winner; Spurt.
The Candidates will be required to run a one-mile, a three-mile, and
a one-and-a-quarter-mile course. -
Problem.—If A is to B as C to D, how would you handicap them for
a two-mile course ?
The Hurdle Race.—This will be exclusively confined to Candidates
for Honours. In every case the Senior Athlete will have to walk round
the Senate House and show his muscle.
The Senate House, by a grace after dinner passed for this special
purpose, will be fitted up yº. les, gymnastic bars, the flyin
jumps, and special corners will be fitted up for the Professors an
Students of the Noble Art of Self-defence.
Honorary Degrees will, in the course of next year, be conferred upon
JEM MACE, NAT LANGHAM, O'BALDWIN, and ToM KING. In honour
of this event, Brasenose College will be called Broken Nose College.
The Great Prize of the Mastership of Trinity College will be given
to the victor (previously duly qualified) after a fair stand-up pugilistic
encounter in the College Quadrangle with an antagonist of his own
size, age, and weight.
The Vice-CHANCELLOR will hold the belt for Fighting, Running,
Leaping, and Pole-jumping, also the Challenge Cups for the same, for
one year, when he will have to meet all comers or resign his office.
Each Vice-Chancellor will, if unchallenged, prove his right to tenure
of office by clearing, a jump of twelve feet high with the leaping-pole.
College Livings will be conferred on Muscular Christians only. They
will be examined in the Evidences of Muscular Christianity. .
Scholarships of £60 per annum, with commons and rooms included,
will be given to the best hands at “putting the weight” and “throw-
ing the hammer.”
Scholarships of £30 for best flat racers over a mile course.
The Proctors will be chosen from the best runners of the year.
Boating, Cricket, and Billiards will be duly considered; as also
Tennis, Rackets, and Fives.
When we come to consider that during this week the Members of
both Universities are engaged in athletic contests and Billiard and
Racket matches, for which they have been in careful training and
practice during the entire foregoing Term, it must be conceded that
the above arrangements are not only not improbable, but will be ren-
dered absolutely necessary by the impossibility of Undergraduates bein
able to find time for even such light studies as the works of the ol
Latin and Greek authors, the study of mathematics, the Constitutional
History of HALLAM, or the philosophic arguments of the playful PALEY.
Recommending the above to the consideration of our University
authorities, and of Parents and Guardians interested in our educational
system, we leave the subject for the present, and remain theirs truly.

CHAPTER THE NINTH.—PAUL PARROT-THE MACAWS–MRS. HUMMIN
BYRDE—MR. RATTELS NAYKE—MR. BYRDE—LADY DODO'S ADVICE
—OF THE PARTY WHERE MR. PARROT GAVE HIS ENTERTAINMENT.
AMONG the other useful people, whom, it was necessary, as LADY
Dodo represented to the MACAws of Macaw to have at their party,
was PAUL PARROT. He is known everywhere as a mimic, a mar-
yellous mimic, who however does not, it is understood, take off his
friends, but exercises his powers on the imitation of well-known public
personages, whose peculiarities afford admirable opportunity for this
style of entertainment. -
Of course there never was a man who imitated that didn't offer to
give you Buckstone, within five minutes after, you'd made his
acquaintance, for give him iwithout the offer. The latter case..is,
erhaps, somewhat dangerous, unless for a professed expert like
ARRot, as an imitation without the previous announcement that it is
intended for So-and-So, is apt to cause mistakes among the audience,
and lead to questions far from complimentary to the imitator's skill.
As a rule it is safer to say, “This is BUCKSTONE,” and do BUCK-
ston E, than to do BuckstoNE first, and then have the chance of being
annoyed by some one saying, “Excellent! CoMPTON wastn't it?”
PAUL PARRoT need never preface any of his mimetical illustrations,
I’m sure; but he does, and modestly gives out “This is Buckstone,”
or “This is MACREADY,” as if to remove the chance of there being any
doubt on the subject afterwards. This is Pºui, PARRot's one talent,
and this he, so to speak, hides in a dinner-napkin, and brings it out
after dessert down-stairs, or up in the drawing-room afterwards, just to
break the monotony of the songs and music, and give a special colour
to the evening's amusement.
“My dear,” says LADY Dopo to MRs. MACAw, “these people draw
their audiences, they have their ‘following 'just as preachers have, and
there are sets where acting and charades and tableaux are all the rage;
and wherever they are given, it is absolutely necessary, in order to
obtain a complete success (which implies that you have made the pre-
vious party-giver jealous, and have raised the spirit of emulation
among the intending hosts) to be supported by ‘such a galaxy of
talent,’ as the old playbills used to say, as MR. NIPPER, MR. WAGG,
MR. fooper, and MR. PAUL PARROT. MRs. HUMMIN BYRDE must
have a part in your operetta, and so must Miss FYNCH. Also, my dear
MRs. MACAw, in arranging your pieces recollect that MRs. ByRDE
always likes to perform with MR. RATTELs NAYKE, who you know has
a beautiful tenor voice, and invariably plays the Lovers, MR. ByRDE,
I believe,” continues LADY DoDo, “has no great liking for MR.
NAYKE, nor for private theatricals in general, though his wife makes
him give them; but that is nothing to us. Only recollect, my dear
MRs. MACAw, that if he is to do anything in office on the Stage, let
him be Prompter. MRs. BYRDE prefers this, and you now a Prompter
cannot leave his place for a minute.”
So LADY Dodo went through her elementary instructions to the
MACAws of Macaw; and hence it happened that Little PAUL PARROT
was of the party.
I had—we had all of us, Goosey, DoRMoUSE, and myself—heard so
much of him that we expected to be snuffed out by PARROT's wit and
brilliancy during dinner. It was an entirely gratuitous assumption,
because why should a man who copies your snuffle, or your growl, or
your squeak, as you º: been gifted by Providence apparently
with an especial eye to PARROT's benefit—I say, why should such an
one be original and witty, and make you die of laughing with any other
kind of humour than that for which he has been peculiarly adapted by
a kindly Nature?
If he were original, he would cease to be MR. PAUL PARROT. If he
set the table in a roar, he would perhaps anticipate the effect to be
produced by his entertainment when we had left the table and betaken
ourselves to sofas and drawing-room chairs.
We met him first at a large party. He was not introduced to any
one of our trio, nor were we to him. I didn't know him by sight, and
no one pointed him out to me as the GREAT PAUL PARROT. But
there he was, like JACK HoRNER, in a corner, and taking his food
with that mimetic mouth, silently and placidly as one who knew his
ower and future triumph, and would not discount his reputation by
zarding an original º I noticed—not knowing who he
was then—that he was rather particular about the salt, and had a mar:
wellously good appetite; but though Miss LAMBKIN sat next him, and
d all she knew to attract him, yet he hadn't a word or a look even
for her, who forthwith began to practise her eye-battery upon a more
susceptible individual, who shall be nameless here, and who would
have utterly succumbed before the attack, had he not been previously
armed against the insidious advances of the SHEEPSEYE Family, whereof
Miss LAMBKIN is of course a member. MR. RATTELs NARE was at
her other elbow, and he was, naturally enough, engaged, as usual (but
I say nothing), with MRs. ByRDE, who certainly did look radiant.
hen the fady Birds had retired to commence warbling aloft, and
º-
we were left, not to drink like Fishes, and turn under the influence of
Circe's Port into Swine, as was half a century ago the abominable
custom, but to refresh ourselves with a libation to the God Chicory,
and a burnt sacrifice of one delicate cigarette to Nicotine, the Dusky
Divinity, then we thought that the host would call on PARROT. But
no: not a word came from our little friend PARRot. Nay more, he
actually, and so did our cruel host, permitted a young University Man,
a Wagtail, who was ignorant of his company, to give an imitation
which had been very popular with his unsophisticated companion
undergraduates, his dequales; but which merely evoked a quiet smile of
pity, from those who knew what was coming, and from the head of
the table the observation, “Ah, you’ll hear some imitations up-stairs
presently, that’ll astonish you; eh, PARRot?” Whereat PARROT smiles
feebly, and attempts nervously to drink nothing out of his coffee-cup.
. Then the host rises, and we go up-stairs. Nightingales and Larks
sing. - MRs. ByRDE and MR. NAYKE give us that “erquisite duet”
out of that “charming operetta” by Young KYNG Fisch ER, the ama-
teur, who, you know, is really quite another OFFENBAch,-‘oh, quite,”
and we all applaud; and then, when the entertainment begins to flag
our host brings PAUL PARRóT from somewhere, out of a corner an
behind a crowd, much as the street conjurer suddenly shows the little
travelling doll popping out of the bag when he has been for some time
supposed to have been absent on a voyage to China. So, unexpectedly,
PARROT steps into the centre of the drawing-room. Some people ask
who he is, and what he is going to do, and others, proud of the know-
ledge, answer that this is PARROT, and now you’ll hear him give the
most wonderful imitations in the world.
The Funny Dogs do not envy him the talent. It doesn’t interfere
with them, and in fact they rather like expressing aloud their testimony
to PARROT's excellent rendering of Buckston E, or PHELPs, or CoMP-
ToN, or WEBSTER, in order to show how familiar they are with the
originals, whom, they give you to understand, they know privately; or,
as the schoolboys used to say, “at home.”
(To be Continued.)
AMERICANISED MEDICINE.
As the Right Honourable the PRESIDENT of THE BOARD OF TRADE
wrote the other day, we are gradually Americanising all our institu-
tions. Unless we stop, Posterity, at least, may see a President writing
his Message to Parliament. Some little time, however, may have to
elapse before every one of our British institutions shall, have been
wholly Americanised. Our social institutions will probably precede
our political in undergoing Americanisation. Among those of our
institutions that are especially getting Americanised, is a part of our
Press, professing to afford us information which it calls “reliable,” and
also abounding, in announcements on which we may rely if their
phraseology strikes us as the language of truth and honesty. Some of
these notifications are formed on models whereof a contemporary thus
quotes an example:—
“A WonDERFUL MEDICINE.-The following advertisement is from a recent
New York paper: “If you want a really pure, unsophisticated ‘family pill,’
buy DR. R.—'s liver-encouraging, kidney-persuading, silent perambulator—
twenty-seven in a box. This pill is as mild as a pet-lamb, and as searchi
as a small tooth-comb. It don't go fooling about, but strictly attends to
business, and is as certain as an alarm clock.”
Puffery resembling, if not quite equalling, that above instanced in wit
and humour, is fast gaining ground among us. America has taught us
how to advertise. Thank BARNUM. The advertising sheet, the poster,
the placard, are in rapid course of being Americanised out and out.
Facetious advertisements, like the foregoing one, tell on the British as
well as on the American Million. In other days the same S Were
wont to be persuaded by the mountebank’s zany to buy his master's
hysic. They were the wise. Their multitude is great and increasing.
So do the wise increase. We have been, and are continuing to be,
Americanised. We are progressing.
“The Use of Salisbury.”
EveRY amateur of old Church Chaunts and Services is familiar with
“The use of Salisbury,” but it is gratifying to find “the use of
Salisbury”, extended from the old religious to the modern Civil
service of the country—in the chant of “We’ve got no work to do,”
as introduced with excellent effect in the Lords, by the active-minded
Marquis of that ilk. To find work for the Lords in the first half of the
Session will be putting SALISBURY to very excellent use indeed.
LEGAL CHARGE.
A CoNTEMPORARY stated that—
i The trial of the great Nun Case cost about two hundred and fifty pounds
a day.'
A Cockney friend adds, that was about a Nun-dred every two hours.

ROGUES ALL!
CoME! Perhaps we, eminently respectables of the shop,
the office and the counting-house, had better not turn up
the whites of our eyes in such very holy horror over the
sinful sixpenny defrauders by false weights and measures
when forty per cent. of us are detected by the Inlan
Revenue Commissioners in making false returns to the
Income-Tax, under Schedule D, and to the tune of 130
per cent. under the mark, on the average statement of our
profits.
Let us add the figures for our own more edification.
Out of 350,000 persons assessed under Schedule D.,
140,000 make false returns.
Amount returned and paid on, £44,042,000.
Amount not returned and not paid on, £57,254,000!
The Metropolis accounts for a fifth of the total assess-
ment under Schedule D.
Every man who relieves his own burden by a dishonest
return, throws an additional burden on his homester neigh-
bour.
We would suggest that Schedule D. should be printed
with a motto from Falstaff:—
“Rob me the Exchequer, the first thing thou dost, and do it
with unwashed hands, too!”

BALLAD OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.
O say not tradesmen cheat in weight,
Or practise fraud in measure,
To such extent as to create
Much harm, or gain:much treasure.
O say not with intent unfair
The shopkeeper arranges
Unequal scales; but wear and tear
Their due proportion changes.

Of all the trading body;
No gross aspersion on them cast—

COMPETITIVE BRITISH JURIES.
MR. PUNCH, - -
ConsideBING the great Convent, trial, every Briton must feel
a very great exaltation of his already high 'opinion of a British Jury:
In that case twelve Protestant jurymen had to settle a question of
convent law between contending Roman Catholics. What next P
Another such body of gentlemen may have to determine doctrinal dis-
utes. A MR. FroUIKEs has written a certain letter to ARchbishop
ANNINg—his. Archbishop. It is, denounced by a portion of the
Roman Catholic Press as heretical. MR. FroULKEs, however, pro-
fesses Catholicism, and has not been excommunicated. Now, suppose
MR. FroULKEs were to bring an action against any organ of his own
denomination for calling him a heretic. Surely he might: heretic is a
word. An accusation of heresy is calculated to do a man injur
with his co-religionists, may even subject him to special damage. #
suppose an action of libel to be brought on that ground by MR.
FFoulkes, or any one else in, the like case. The defendants would
plead, a justification, and call authorities to support it...Opposite
experts would be called by the plaintiff, including, perhaps, those who,
if they deemed him a heretic, should, and would, officially have pro-
nounced him one. Then, of these differing Roman Catholic doctors,
a British Protestant Jury would have to decide which were right and
.* §: wrong in deciding whether the plaintiff was a heretic or
not. Sling-
g “O tremendous British Jury !”
Of course the same arbiters may also be called upon, in like manner,
to determine a similar controversy between Wesleyans, Independents,
Baptists, or litigants of any other Protestant persuasion, Churchmen
inclusive, and even Jews as well.
Now, therefore, your British Jury ought to be perfectly fit to perform
the united functions of the Court of Arches and the Consistory of
Rome, together with every kind of Dissenting Council or Conference,
and the tribunal which serves for the Jewish Sanhedrim into the bar-
in. To be, however, thoroughly up to all this work, British ju
en
in general can hardly, perhaps, be considered to have had quite so
much education as they ought. But that advantage could be insured
only by a system of examinations—at which the majority of persons at
present liable to serve as jurors would take exceedingly good care to be
plucked. The sole way to get any of them to pass would be that of
paying jurymen liberally for their services. If this were done, the
examinations for the Jury List might even be made competitive. What
a noble institution the British Jury would then become!, There would
be no more petty juries; every jury would be a Grand Jury. Com-
posed of successful competitors, our British Jury would indeed be
what, in original language, I may venture to call the envy of sur-
rounding nations and the admiration of the world.
The honour, and still more the emolument, of being empanelled on
a jury would then be sought, instead of the inconvenience and the
loss .# if possible, avoided, by the generality of persons in the
position o A Household ER.
P.S. What would be a small addition to the County rates? Qnly
the price of exemption from a burden and a bore often attended with a
ruinous loss of that time which is money.
A WEGETABLE GIANT.
THE Builder reports the arrival from Nicaragua of specimens of
“one of the most gigantic plants in the vegetable kingdom.” They
may be said to be 5.Pwith the aristocracy of that kingdom, as
the plant is “closely allied to ” those distinguished members of the
Arum family, our English “Lords and Ladies.” It has only one leaf,
but that one is nearly fourteen feet long, supported on a stalk measur-
ing ten. The flower-stem is a foot in circumference—the flower, or
spathe itself, two feet in length. As to colour this Aracean, or
Aroidean, monster, is “pur ish blue,” and it exhales, “a powerful
carrion-like odour,” being thus strong in full proportion to its size.
Finally, our architectural contemporary informs us that “as this re-
markable species of Aroideae is quite new to men of science, it has not
as yet received a name.” In compliment to the City of London,
suppose the botanical authorities call it Gogmagogus graveolens.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MILITARY ARITH METIC.
Y DEAR MR. CARDWELL,
I congratul ATE you
heartily upon the progress
in arithmetic which you are
making at the War Office.
Your & predecessor never
studied further than addi-
tion; , but you are bold
enough to venture on some
roblems in reduction.
ou will require both skill
and courage in mastering
this rule, but you need not
be afraid while you have me
to back you. I think that
on the whole you have
worked out your four first
sums with very fair success.
The reduction of the Army
by, eleven, thousand men,
and the reducing of the esti-
mates by a on and a
quarter, are problems you
may E. yourself on havin
nearly conquered. This is,
consider, a good result of
- - - ... labour, seeing that you did
not begin to work till Christmas. Still you cannot be too careful in
the way, you do your sums. Here, for instance, are mistakes which
you might have well avoided:—
... “The most useful arms in the Service are undoubtedly the infantry of the
line and the artillery. In the former we have reduced some 7000 men, in the
latter 1439. The least useful branch of the Service for military purposes, or,
as far as we are aware, for, any purpose but such as the beefeaters would
answer as well, is the household cavalry; and in these corps the reduction
amounts to 12 men l’’
. I don't think beefeaters on horseback would look by any means so
impºsing as life-guardsmen, and, it is chiefly as mere ornaments that
our life-guards are of use. Still in the eyesight of a taxpayer their
looks may seem imposing in quite another sense, if he only takes the
trouble to consider what they cost him:—
“The cost of the 1308 life-guardsmen, who delight the nurserymaids in
St. James' Park, is no less than £121,834, without including the expenses
connected with their barracks; while the same number of artillery and
infantry men would cost £62,866 and £52,320 respectively. In other words
the country pays for each showy life-guard who appears in London or Windsor
£93 per annum, as compared with £47 for the gunner and £40 for the foot-
soldier, for service in every part of the world.”
What we want our Army for is not for splendour but security. We
enlist recruits for soldiers, not for showmen. Never mind how nurse-
maids may cry for their lost loves. . Reduce the Ornamentals, when
next you try your hand at a problem.in reduction. The Sovereigns of
France and of Austria and of Prussia are each of them content with
two hundred for their body-guard, and if the thirteen hundred life-
[. were reduced to the same number, I think the fact would not

pleasing to your 43&ANCh.

HINTS FOR CONVERSATION.
“ON the behaviour of Thermometers in a Vacuum,” the title of a
paper lately read before the Royal Society,+worded, by the way, as
though thermometers were creaſures offlesh and blood instead of tubes
of glass and quicksilver, and accountable for their actions—leads
one to think of the behaviour of Society in a vacuum or pause in con-
versation, and the valuable auxiliary that man or woman is who can
fill it up with suitable stopping. . For Society abhors a vacuum, and
you will secure honours and rewards, smiles and invitations, by making
its existence, when you are present, an impossibility. The newspapers
carefully examined will often . material. Take this as a sample.
“SIR CHARLES BRIGHT has picked up the electric cable lost last year
between Florida and Havannah.” There are famous Twins now ex-
hibiting in London, and a Giantess, also a Circassian Lady, all ºf
it is reported, a good business in shillings; but if SIR CHARLEs co d
be induced to show himself in the character of the strongest man, that
ever lived, and º a few feats of this sort, the receipts would be
enormous, and he would soon pick up a fortune. (Newspapers want
very careful editing: here are two or three ſittle mishaps. #. eminent
Frenchman lately dead, M. Troplong, the President of the Senate, is
registered in one of the chronicles as having been born in “1705”; the
actor now ſº at Drury Lane is spoken of as “DR.” DILLON; and
a young lady of the name of “EDITH" is twice mentioned in a notice
of School, who was certainly not in the piece when we had the pleasure
of seeing it.)
You will find everybody still in the blues, and you are recommended
to § scarf and charter a steamer, and “Go to Putney” to see the
Boat Race, if you have social engagements for the 17th and following
days, and do not wish to be completely stranded in conversation, or
considered a poor dull creature unacquainted with the light entrées of
the table—the names of the crews, and the Court Circular, and the new
colour, and bicycle Velocipedes, and the fate of DEMONIA HUDDERBURN
in the last number of The Monthly Stimulant, and only caring for such
solid fare as the Debate on the Second Reading, or Habitual Criminals,
or the Site of the Law Courts, or PRESIDENT GRANT, whose Cabinet
you will be surprised to find does not enter half so much into table-talk
as MRs. THwaites's, or MADAME RAcHEL’s furniture.
Take the opportunity, when discussing the Race, (which you may be
certain the papers will say was attended by a greater crowd than in any
previous year, and was timed by one of MAYNE SPRING's chronographs,) if
there is a seaman present, to ask him what “logarithmic waves” are;
and do not be astonished if the great contest brings on the cloth other
University matters of the highest moment. Can you guess what they
are P You very properly *: unattached Students, or new Pro-
fessorships, or the Abolition of Religious Tests, or, perhaps, the Keble
College P. Nothing of this sort will come on for hearing. You mistake
if you suppose that the main object of a modern. University education
is study: you would jump to a right conclusion if you said it was sport.
Oxford and Cºl. are splendid Gymnasiums, with the public
schools for preparatory academies, and will soon, no doubt, have
athletic Professors, Fellows, and Scholars; and men will go out in the
Athletical school just as they do now in that; of History or Natural
Science—only in greater numbers. Boat-races, cricket-matches, bil-
liard-matches, racket-matches, athletic sports—with all these pressin
engagements to attend to, is it not unreasonable to expect a man to fin
time for a careful study of the works of THUCYDIDEs and ARISTOTLE,
or the tedious productions of EucLID and NEwToN ? So-for you
will hardly like to appear an ignoramus in the presence of a young
gentleman with perfect clothes and a faultless arrangement of his hair,
whose parents pay three hundred a year that he may decorate the
family i. with silver cups and medals—qualify yourself in-
stanter to talk about pole-jumping, and hurdle-races, and putting the
weight, and throwing the hammer, and the wide jump, and the high
jump, and all the id: new University studies which, by their intro-
duction into the academical curriculum, are bringing plenty of business
to a most valuable class of men—the silversmiths—and, as some #.
think, to the doctors also. But if Paterfamilias approves of all this
athleticism, on the whole preferring it to asceticism, who need growl?

SIR. C. E. TREVELYAN suggests that Cleopatra's needle should be

We confess we can’t quite see the point even of so large a needle on
such a site. We would suggest, as a more appropriate_position, on
geographical and other considerations, the front of the India Öffice,
and beside the needle, a statue of John DUKE of ARGYLL, as the
greatest CAM'EL living, trying to get through the eye of it!

THE LAST LAUNCH AT DEPTFORD,
Loyally and Lovingly Dedicated by M.R. PUNCH to H.R.H. PRINCEss
Louise.
If there’s a spirit of the tree, as fair Greek fable tells
And the green blood of the Dryad is the sap of acorn-bells,
Not death, but higher life, befalls the Nymphs of the oak-trees
That are squared and shaped, and set to frame the ships that rule the
Seas.
And they were not doleful Dryads, but exulting ones that spread
Their unseen wings for shelter of Louise's gracious h
As she faced the nipping March wind, like a daughter of the sea,
To christen the last war-ship that from Deptford launched will be.
Lift high the wine, sweet Princess, and with blood-red baptism crown,
The bows, slow creeping streamwards, as the dog-shores are struck
OWn :
And, fit name for last heart of oak that from Deptford-slips shall glide,
Bid “God speed” to The Druid, as she curt'sies to the tide.
'Tis the last launch from Deptford; the old yard has had its day;
Times change and war-ships with them: oak yields to iron's sway:
There are wider slips and statelier sheds, and broader quays elsewhere,
And Wisdom says “concentrate,” and Thrift says “save and spare.”
Deptford is now a frowsy place, ill-smelling, dank and low,
Where muddy banks are eat away by a ſoul stream's festering flow:
Where low §. haunts and flaunts, and flares, fed full on sailors' gains,
And threatening them with surer wreck than all lee-shores or mains.
But the Deptford that we look on, to whose yard we bid goodbye, ,
Was once #. Deptford, where, in pride, The Great Harry wont to lie;
Where, lusty King to lordly ship, from his Greenwich palace near,
Bluff F. HAL among his shipwrights showed broad breast and face
of cheer.
With delicate ANNE Boley'N upon his brawny arm—
Lamb and Lion,-monarch's majesty, enhancing woman's charm-
To mark, well pleased, how in his yard the work sped swift along,
From fair keel to tall top-side of swift pink and carrack strong.
And rapid ran the Ravensbourne, a cleanly country stream,
Glassing in its bright bosom, brave attire, and banners' glean,
When, fenc'd in tower of jewelled ruff and tun of pearlèd robe,
Came §, Qures Bess to welcome CAPTAIN DRAKE from round the
globe .
'Twas in this very Deptford creek was drawn The Gºlden Hind,
Fragrant with spices of New Spain, rich with heap'd spoils of Ind,
As to bold Queen bold Buccaneer knelt on his own deck-board
Plain CAPTAIN DRAKE, and rose again SIR FRANCIS from her sword.
'Twas in Deptford yard, from reign to reign, the PETTs” their credit
won,
Handing their craft of ship-builder from famous sire to son;
To Deptford smug SAM PKPys took boat, in CHARLEs's thriftless day,
To note “how still our debts do grow, and our fleet do decay.”
And hither, from the fair-trimmed yews and hollies of Sayes Court,
Came a burly, bull-necked Muscovite, for labour and disport;
Sturdy swinker, lusty drinker; king with king, and tar with tar,
The Northern Demiurgus, Russ Prometheus, PETER TzAR.
Richer in slips and'stores and sheds, there be other yards, I trow,
But none more rich in memories. Old Deptford yard, than thou.
t was well done and worthily of a Princess fair and sweet,
o christen the last war-babe, born of thee into our fleet.
And may The Druid ne'er disgrace the parentage she owns,
Or mar the glorious memories that spring from Deptford stones:
May she bear her worthy England, and the white hand that but now
Has dashed the wine of baptism upon her shapely bow !
* The Perrs were the hereditary ship-builders of the English navy from
the days of JAMEs THE FIRST to those of JAMES THE SEcoxb.
A Third Competitor.
It may have escaped, observation that on the day of the University
Boat Race there were three eights on the River—the Oxford Eight, the
Cambridge Eight, and the Chiswick Eyot.

ATTENTION, Judges, Gentlemen of the Long Robe, and British Public
at large, to the following utterance of the MASTER or THE Rolls, re-
orted to have been delivered in SANGER v. SANGER, er parte DR.
AMEs CLARK. Note that the sum referred to in it was that of a
hundred guineas, which DR. CLARK having at first declined, had
finally accepted.
“His LoRDSHIP said, I think this sum is even more than DR. CLARK is
entitled to, and I must dismiss his summons with costs from the time when
he rejected the guardians' offer of a hundred guineas. I think it right to add
that if the case had not ended as it has, I should have disallowed the visits to
the sea-side altogether, as well as the concluding item, and have materially
reduced the allowance for visits.”
DR. CLARK had, as a general *. attended two young ladies,
sisters, the elder for some slight complaint, the younger for measles
and other ailments of a dangerous kind which “required his continuous
care and attention for many weeks.” These young ladies were at
school at St. John's Wood. DR. CLARK had paid one hundred and
twenty-five visits, inclusive of two journeys to Worthing and three to
Brighton, besides meeting SIR WILLIAM JENNER in consultation thrice.
He charged at the rate of a guinea a visit—or half-a-guinea, when he
saw the two., His whole claim amounted to £3105s. 6d, which,
besides extra charges for the journeys out of town, comprised a fee of
six guineas paid to DR. JENNER, and forty guineas for “correspondence
and sundry consultations and interviews with the solicitors and other
parties interested in the cause.” This claim, for which he had sued
the guardians of the young ladies, DR CLARK had “adjourned from
Chambers,” whereat the Chief Clerk had awarded him £82 13s., which
the MASTER OF THE ROLLs appears to have thought enough, as he
considered a hundred guineas too much.
It may be that DR CLARK, in the amount which he claimed, did not

We see announced a recent invention by a foreigner for

may live to hear of journals being hired for perusal, and
then sent back to be cleaned and reprinted for next day.

One would like, however, to know how much the briefs of those learned

are accustomed to derive from their clients fall, on an average, very
much below the rate at which that medical gentleman, charges his
patients. If a tariff were to be fixed, for Law, proportionate to that
which the MASTER of THE Rolls adjudges to Medicine, would not the

[MARCH 27, 1869.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MoWTAY, March 15. This week, but, not until Thursday, began the
Grand Remonstrance against the Irish Church Bill, which the Con.
servatives call Spoliation, but MR. DISRAELI will not—he draws the Miº
line at Confiscation, a much prettier word, and derived, as Mr. Punch's
boys, just home for Easter, inform him, from the Latin signifying
“laid up in the public, treasury.” This is rather a happy escape from
nonsense, only we doubt whether the Conservatives, generally, are suffi-
ciently up in their classics to appreciate their leader's delicate euphemism.
Laid up in the public treasury is just what the Irish Church revenues
are going to be,
But Mr. Punch will briefly note the work which preceded the Re-
monstrance. Qn :*4. Lords took the Criminals, in hand, made
the clause against the Receivers of Stolen Goods still more severe,
and listened to the appeal of the Pawnbrokers, who allege that a great
many of them are too respectable, to deserve to be included in, a
Bill directed againstrascaldom. This appeal was felt to be reasonable,
and there is to be a separate measure for the Universal Uncle. Why
the Marine Store-keepers should also be allowed consideration, Mr.
Punch is unaware, as he considers them pests, who do more to
encourage the breeding of thieves than any class of the 'QUEEN’s
subjects. He would like to see them extirpated. But he trusts that
the powers which will be given to the police for dealing with them will
be carried out with such persistent and unrelenting vigilance and
severity that, the abominable trade, will soon become hardly worth
following., M.R. MELTER Moss is also to be legislated for, and we
hope that he also will hear something greatly to his disadvantage.
AIDERMAN WATERLow was declared unduly elected, on the ground
that he had not relinquished a Government contract quite early enough.
Formalities are valuable, but Mr. Punch will be sorry if an energetic
and able reformer of social grievances should not be again returned.
MR. *:::::::: at Bradford, took his seat, and Mr. Punch joined in
the cheer which greeted this distinguished Dissenter, because, though
the former is by no means in accord with MR. Miº upon man
subjects, he is a thoroughly honest champion of the opinions whic
he professes. MIALL, according to the learned MR. MARKANTHONY
Low ER (whose book on the derivation and meaning of family names is
the pleasantest of reading) is from MIGHELL, a mediaeval form of
MICHAEL, which it may be agreeable and ††, to the Member
for Bradford to know, when he is fighting with the Dragon Establish-
ment.
. The “heedless rhetoric.”—headless would be as good a word—of a
ridiculous Irish priest called SHANAHAN (what can it signify what a
creature called SHANAHAN says *) received more notice than it de-
served. Most of the utterances of such folk may be dismissed in the
spirit in which FoxTENELLE spoke of his brother, also a priest.
“What does your brother say, M., De FoxTENELLE **, “In the
morning he says mass.” “And in the evening?” “In the evening
he does not know what he says.”
We then had a most interesting speech from MR. ForsTER, ex-
fº. his scheme, for the Reform of Endowed Grammar Schools.
f.people comprehended the importance of this subject, they would
more about it. We have the means of giving a capital Secondary
Education (as distinguished from Elementary) to every boy of “pregnant
wit,” and we have a net £350,000 to give it with. But we have let the
schools ſº to the Juice, and it is very hard work to get a boy, taught
at all. If you send him to a costly school, he learns Greek and cricket,
and if you send him to a cheap school he learns nothing but slang.
Now, as we want him to learn some classics, much science, and several
modern languages, reading, writing, and arithmetic, it is clear that our
system is wrong. It could be all set right, without injury to anybody,
and with incalculable benefit to myriads, by carrying out the wise in:
tentions of our ancestors. This is what MR. ForsTER’s Bill is designed
to effect; and we wish it all success. . If the British Parent is better
than a Parent of Goslings, he will wake up on this question. The Bill
goes to a Select Committee. -
The University Tests Bill was read a Second Time, after an able
speech by SIR. RoundELL PALMER, who §. to introduce into it
a declaration that the admission of non-Churchmen to the government
of the University shall not interfere with the system of religious in-
struction now, or hereafter to be established there. This seems but a
sort of anodyne effort, but it may soothe sundry. In the course of
his speech he quoted Čowrººs. description of the sheep who were so
frightened by the hounds that it was proposed by one terrified ovis
that—
“To save our lives we leap into the pit.”
..Mr. Punch apologises for the burst of laughter which broke from
him when the next orator rose, and which seemed to puzzle the
SPEAKER, and all around, but the fact was that the next ſines in the
poem occurred to him:—
“Then followed him his loving mate and true,
But more discreet than he, a Cambrian Ewe.”
for the next Member who rose was MR. O. MoRGAN, a clever Welsh
Member. Of course, he is neither SIR. RoundELL’s mate, nor a Ewe,
but that’s nothing when a witäkism occurs. He spoke very well...So
did DR.I.YoN PLAYFAIR, whom Mr. Punch welcomes to the political
arena. The Bill was read a Second Time without a division, though
. HARDY, admitting that there was as much personal religion
(what’s this—a religion that likes personalities?), among Dissenters as
among Churchmen, fulminated valiantly against it.
Tuesday was a Ballot Night. MR. LEATHAM delivered, about as
good a speech for secret voting as you should desire to hear, and
wished it made an instruction to the Committee, which is to sit on the
uestion of ing Parli and Municipal elections more pure,
that they should consider ot. , SIR GEORGE GREY and the
PREMIER, however, thought this unadvisable, and the motion was
withdrawn, Observe the Cartoon, for an exquisite and exact illustra-
tion of the hugely mended is of “Little Boy Ballot.”
MR. WHALERY, having w Income Tax flotions, was cruelly
derided by MR. Lowe, and replied that the cellor was impertinent,
and therefore—mark the wise WHALLEy—he would divide. But MR.
BRIGHT told him not to be so absurd, so he abstained. -
The only other remarkable things were that on the Party Processions
Act Colon EL KNox (we told you that Our Colonel was to the fore)
stated that MR. GLADstoNE was about to fling the Bible on the floor
of the House. Whatever the PREMIER's intentions may have been, he
performed no such indecorous act that evening—nor has he done it up
to the time of our going to press.
. Mednesday. Revenue officers can vote, but now they want a relaxa-
tion of the law which prevents their meddling and muddling in elec-
tions. MR. GLADstone opposed the proposal, and spoke strongly
against imitating one of the worst features of American arrangements.
It was rejected by 207 to 88.
MR. AYRTON, for Government, opposed the Bill for freeing news.
É. from actions for libel in respect of reports, "...ºf that
vernment were] going to bring in a great measure for establishin
the Freedom!of the Press, This sensational announcement is wort
noting—we fancied that the Press had made a Public Qpinion which
had a y established that Freedom, but officials know best.
Thursday. My Lords had a spirited debate on the Administration of
Law in Ireland, and there was much taunting of Government for
letting loose the Fenians, whose friends exult and jeer, “No more
advice” is to be given to the QUEEN on the subject, which means that
the Fenians now in gaol are to stick there—and very proper, too.
In the Commons, as hath been said, the Grand Remonstrance began.
MR. DISRAELI, in pursuance, of notice, led off with an oration, termi-
nating with a motion that the Church Bill be rejected. Now, neither
in the case of MR. DisPARII, nor of the other speakers, is Mr. Punch
going to flood his invaluable space with notices of twenty times used
arguments. He merely means to note anything salient, or sapient.
R. DISRAELI's speech was, in one sense, a failure. Yet Mr. Punch
is not sure that such failure is not more honourable to his candour,
and more creditable to his brains, than if he had delivered the most
fervent and brilliant of harangues against his manifest convictions.
The best thing that can be said of his speech is, that it º dissatis-
fied his party, who were ominously silent, who went away displeased,
and whom it was sought to comfort next, day by... assurances... that
there was the utmost wisdom in their chief’s “studied moderation.”
You may judge him generously, or cynically, according to your natures.
If you take the former alternative, you may say that though accident
has made him the head of the Tories, he cannot talk their nonsense
and that as MACAULAY wrote of PEEL, he could but “perform the har
task of translating the gibberish of bigots into º: which might
not mis-become the mouth of a man of sense.” If the latter, you can
hint that MR. DISRAELI was too clever to make a speech that should
effectually prevent his ever taking advantage of the chapter of acci;
dents, and again leading the House of Commons. Anyhow, he delivered
a mere Perfunctory Protest. He expatiated upon the advantages of
religion, and upon the freedom which a Union of Church and State
had given us, and pictured the consequences of a destruction of tolera-
tion. The Church of Ireland was not the only cause of Irish disaffec-
tion, and we should next have to deal with the Land. If the principle
of confiscation were to be introduced into Ireland, it must also be in-
troduced into England. . After some ingenious battering at the details
of the measure, and a few adroitly framed and, amusing paradoxes,
which he would be the last to call arguments, he described the measure
as apmost dangerous one. If MR. DISRAELI were bound tº say...any-
thing, Punch does not see how much less he could, say, in his§: ".

| M - **śse man pays his brains
a compliment by going
about the streets a
sloven. Men of talent,
great writers, and
great orators, must
cherish the belief that
they are superior to
dress, or the shabbiest men in the community would not be found so often in
their ranks.”
All this is undeniable. There are, however, those who take no
trouble whatever about their dress from quite another cause than the
idea that it is unworthy of a sensible person. Let me describe one of
them. Sir, I am accustomed, myself, to dress without the least regard
to any other considerations than common decency, comfort, durability,
cleanliness, and cheapness—I never did dress with much concern for
aught else. That was simply because I knew it would be thrown away.
In º best days even I was short, fat, and dumpy, not, indeed, exactly
round as to figure, but oval; my circumference at the waist being my
eatest, and the measure thereof considerably exceeding my height.
y legs were what my schoolfellows called bandy, as of course they
remain ; and in growing older. I have grown not taller but bigger
round, so that my form º. that of the Earth, and if I were a
monk I might be said to belong to the Order of Oblate Fathers.
In face I was, and am, what women euphemistically call plain—in a
lain word, º Not only were my features always as coarse and
lumpish, nearly, as they are now, but they at all times wore a dull, un-
intelligent expression, which has by no means improved with years;
and if I were quite as foolish as, I look, I should be as great a fool,
almost, as anyone I know. -
. Now, if any arts of dress could possibly have rendered my bodily
disadvantages otherwise than remarkable, I should certainly not have
failed to dress, in my youth at least, as well as I could afford:—
“Costly my habit as my purse could buy.”
Because, never having been an object of anybody's fear, I have often
had my personal defects ridiculed in my own presence. . When I was a
boy some other boys would continually inform me of them; just as
men, who were once such boys, are, chiefly for want of anything wiser
to say, wont to remind each other that they are § old, losing
their hair, their teeth, their sight, their memory, or their intellect.
Now, so long as people º that, is likely to do me any
damage, I don't care a straw how they talk about me behind my back.
Anyhow they may
object to being made fun of to my face. If a man merely gird at my
laugh at me as much as ever they please. But I |
nose, and I pull his, I commit an assault. Prudence may even forbid
me to retort upon him in a sarcasm. Not resenting his insult, I feel a
temporary humiliation. To be sure it is only temporary, but for the
time it is unpleasant, and could I avert this annoyance by wearing
a better dress I would, unless it were too expensive.
I should once have taken as great pains about my clothing as any
fop could, if I had been so good looking a fellow as to be capable of
conciliating the favour of young ladies; but I knew that nothing I
could put on would prevent me from being outweighed, in their esti-
mation, by every handsome fool. I have now attained to an age at
which every man, ceases to be an object of interest to the gentler sex,
unless he is rich; but, if I thought that, by an improvement of my cos.
tume, I could ingratiate myself with the better sort of them, I should
still be. disposed to adopt it., Circumstanced as I am, however, all
expenditure on decoration, which would be unavailing and not pay, is
excluded by the economy which of necessity presides overm be.
What I, save by thus retrenching that outward show that could give
me no pleasure, enables me to purvey gratification to 'a sensitive in-
terior. So, albeit never taking the least trouble about my dress, I am
not, I contend, ever ill-dressed. On the contrary, I say, I always dress
as well as I need to, and therefore nobody can really dress b than
Your humble Servant,
* GUIDO.
P.S.. I assure you that, whenever I cease to be importuned by
beggars, I always purchase new apparel. Iſdoubt whether, I could
dress much better tº: I do, if I tried to. I º quit the slop-shop,
indeed, and employ a tailor to make my clothes, if I could find anybody
worthy of that name who would venture. I could ask M.R. PooDE, but
think it very probable that he would refuse.
GLORY, GLORY, ABYSSINIA
Five million pounds voted last Session for the Abyssinian war !
Three more .#. to be voted immediately by the present Parlia-
ment, and how much besides Robert does not know. The Income-Tax
payers had better make up their minds to be fleeced, altogether to the
amount of £10,000,000. For all these millions we have to show the
captives of the late. THEoophe, and a quantity of Glory. O Glory,
what millions have been lavished in thy name! -
The Yankee soldiers in the Secession Civil War, used to march sing-
ing a song about Joh N BRowN's body, of which the burden began
with “Glory ! Glory !” They sang that ultimately to the tune of
many millions; so many that it is to be hoped they will not be. in
a hurry to sing it again. Its notes were greenbacks, which, standing
for dollars, in sum equivalent to hundreds of millions of pounds
sterling, formed altogether a tune that was very dolorous.
THEopoRE was no ARMINIUS, and LoRD NAPTER OF MAGDALA proved
himself anything but a WARUs, so that Her Most Gracious MAJESTY
has no cause to cry, with CAESAR AUGUSTUs, “O NAPIER, restore me
my, legions!” But, the Income-Tax, payer may well shriek, and will
find himself in case to shriek yet louder, “O Abyssinia, give me back
my millions !” - - - -
The Income Taxed portion of the community may, however, console
themselves with the consideration that, besides the Glory which their
country has made them pay for, there certainly are the rescued pri:
soners to show. Glory, with nothing else, has generally been the most
successful result of our wars, and now that battles have to be fought
with iron-sided turret-ships, and projectiles so highly improved that
shells cost from twenty pounds or so, and no shot that will make any
considerable smash can |. fired under some five pounds, the war tax-
paying class cannot but implore the Government and the Legislature
to go to the very yerge of national, humiliation, rather than incur
another Glory Bill which that class will be obliged to defray.
** A Vision of Life.”
A TRINITy College (Dublin) man was talking the other day upon
the small value attached to life by uncivilised nations. Somebody rº:
marked that in China, if a man were condemned, ſo death, he could
easily hire a substitute to die for him, "Ah yes,” said T.C. D., "I
believe many poor fellows get their living by being substitutes that
way.”
Puffer's English.
In the catalogue of the articles to be disposed of at the sale of old
Beautifull-for-EveR's effects in Bond. Street, one chattel was..de-
scribed in vulgar auctioneers' slang as a “ matchless ” sideboard. Why

POWERTY AND PHYSIC.
THANKs to MR. ToRRENs, who Fºº their petitions, above a
hundred Poor-Law Doctors appeaſed the other day to the Collective
Wisdom of the country, for redress from certain grievances imposed on
them by certain Boards of Poor-Law Guardians, who may not º
be viewed as part of the Collective Folly of the country. Of these
grievances the principal are over-work and underpay, and that there
. certainly some fair grounds for a grumble, the following will
Snow :-
“There are parishes in London, and other great towns, where the É of the
medical officer does not exceed threepence on an average for each individual
case. . Can anything be more unfair to him, or unwise for the community?
How is it possible that he can be expected to devote the time and attention
necessary for checking disease before its disastrous ripening, or dealing with
its symptoms after it has come to maturity, when hundreds are distracting his
attention by their importunities, and when the paramount claims of his own
household hourly call upon him not to neglect §. private practice, whereby
alone he can live?”
This we quote from the Eraminer, a journal which is noted for its
ood sound common-sense. As a rule, our Pooriaw guardians are not
amous for this quality, or the would not expect one Doctor to do the
work of six. Such pennywisdom leads to pound foolishness, of course,
for by, allowing poor sick people the sixth part of what they want in
medical attentions, their maladies, are likely to be multiplied sixfold.
Thus disease is spread, and, parishes are over-burthened with sick
paupers, who might otherwise be healthy, active labourers, and in need
of no relief.
For remedy, the Eraminer gives the following good advice:—
“One or other of two things ought to be done. Poor-Law medical officers
ought to be so multiplied as that their work for the parish or the union should
be .# compensated by a moderate stipend; or the stipend should be
so augmented as to justify their being deb from private practice.”
... We can fancy what a braying would be heard in certain board-rooms,
if either of these notions were proposed to be adopted. What he-haws
would arise at the idea of Parish Doctors being paid enough to free them
from the need of private practice, and to enable them (it would be
added) to visit their out-patients in an elegant new carriage, and to
amass a handsome fortune in, say, half-a-dozen years! Yet, after all, it
may be questioned if this extravagance would not be cheaper than the
present stingy * of screwing down poor Doctors to such a scanty
pittance, that they would soon themselves be paupers did they not
i. earn money by neglecting, somewhat, those committed to
elr Care.

LITTLE Boy Ballot, come blow me your horn,
Many now love you who laughed you to scorn:
Where’s the small boy who was ordered to keep
Under the hustings, fast asleep
Bribing and bullies have waked him now,
And Cabinet Members are patting his pow,
Bidding him bring out his musical box,
That echoes the notes of the popular vor.
The Government Gymnast.
WHAT's the use of complaining that Athletic Exercises occupy three
times more of a schoolboy's attention than they ought to do? MR.
FoRSTER himself has recognised the system, and actually declares this
to be his notion of the use of an Endowed School,
“WE will MAKE LADDERs of THESE Schools.”

IT is stated that SIR John LAwRENCE, when raised to the Peerage,
will take the title of Foyle. “Foyle”. SIR John may be, and deserves
totbe, but foiled we can never imagine him to be, under any circum-
stances.

THE RECORDERPS RIGHTS OF WIVES BILL.
So, MR. Russell, GURNEy, you have brought into Parliament & Bill
for securing the #. . Fº to Wives. Very good, Sir, of
ou; and so much worse for handsome CAPTAIN ScAMP and his
§ including º: But now, when next yºu, are ºn
your legs to speak upon your Married Women's Property Bill, could
*W. answer these questions?
hen a wife, under your arran
property of her. own, will her hus
thereof, or the dividends? lf not, and
them, will he rob her? -
If he rob her, will he commit a crime? What will that be; petty
larceny or felony? Will, he beliable to be tried for it? In that ease
will she be permitted to give evidence against him? Should his theft
amount to felony, will he, on conviction, forfeit all his goods and
chattels to the Crown?
If a rogue of a husband pick his wife's pocket, will she be enabled to
calla policeman into the house and give the offender in charge, and
will a Magistrate be empowered to sentence him summarily to imprison-
ment and hard labour?
If a brute of a husband not only rob his wife, but also beat or throttle
her, º: robbery with violence, do you make the conjugal
garotter liable to be flogged? - -
If a wife die intestate with surviving relatives, will her widower
inherit only his “thirds”? In that case will not the following verses
probably be set to music by some future MozART:—
ements, possesses real or personal
be entitled to claim the rent
nevertheless take and pocket
MAKE THY WILL.
O LOVE what life shines .# thine eyes
So bright, of clear unclouded blue !
What radiant health, my Treasure, dyes
Thy dimpled cheeks with roseate hue !
How frail a thing is yet that life!
I think its loss myself would kill.
But lest I should, my little wife, -
Perchance survive thee, make thy Will.
O'er us, united, many years,
I trust, there are to roll away;
But who can, in this vale of tears,
Be certain of another day?
The least delay how oft we rue !
Precaution let that thought instil
What should be done at once to do:
Now that is, dearest, make thy Will.
Else I should not obtain the whole;
Some part would go away from me :
Mytown one, make me, then, thy sole
Yxecutor and Legatee.
Then let the º fly,
Far distant be that hour, until,
If I be not the first to die,
When thou wilt leave me. Make thy Will.
.The foregoing Stanzas are supposed to be sung by a fond husband to
his young wife who has come into the possession of pr y which, in
the event of her death and intestacy, he would divide with co-heirs.
PHOEBUS AND ARCHIMEDES,
Accorping to GULLIVER, the savans of Laputa spent a good deal of
their time in attempting the extraction of sunbeams out of cucumbers.
We find it easier in England to reverse the problem, and with the help
of earth and seed to grow cucumbers from sunbeams. But this appears
a paltry purpose to which to put our sunshine, when we learn from a
late letter to the Stockholm. Aftonbladet that, by condensing the sun’s
rays a motive power may be generated equivalent to stopping the
motion of the earth. “Stand out of my sunshine,” will certainly be
tº the order of the day, if credit be attached to calculations such as
“In weather suitable for the action of sun-machines the action of the sun
on a superficies of 100 square feet can evaporate 489 cubic inches of water
in an hour. This corresponds to the action of a motive force capable of
raising 29,750 lbs. one foot per minute, and is rather greater than one-horse
power. It follows that 64,800 steam-engines, of 100-horse power each, can be
worked with the rays thrown on a Swedish square mile. Archimedes, having
calculated the force of the lever, explained that he could move the earth from
its position. I assert that by condensing the rays of the sun, a foree could be
created that might arrest the earth in its course.”
We doubt if any patent will be taken out for sun-machines, in this
country at least, for as a rule the sun shines barely more than once a
fortnight; and, thanks to smoke and fogs, there is little fear at present
that'any iondon arant will condense sufficient sunbeams to stop the
earth from moving, and thereby whirl us off its surface into never-
ending space. But it really makes us shudder when we read of things
like sun-machines, and imagine Archimedes living, say, in Africa, with
sunshine always handy, and experimenting quietly to send us all to
smash To condense the solar rays is a grand idea, no doubt, and a
century or two hence some good may be got out of it. Meanwhile, we
wish that somebody, instead of bothering his brains about “arresting the
earth's course,” would try to hit upon a plan for º: sunshine into
bottles, so that we might import it, as easily as oranges, for our winter's
use. As for condensing sunshine for practical utility, that, we fear,
will prove all moonshine,
BEZIQUE.”
Doubts having arisen as to which is the right way to play this
fashionable game, we have waded through a lot of correspondence in
the newspapers, and have come to the conclusion that these are the
proper rules:-
1. The game is commenced by each player cutting a card, and is
ended by each player cutting away.
2. The highest cutter deals, Nº. in cases of dispute, a foot rule may
be sent for so that somebody may measure him.
3. A ten can take a king, and a cat may look at one,
4. When some one plays the knave, in certain cases some one else
may send for a policeman.
.5. Should a player be so lucky as to score 500 for a double bézique,
his opponents are allowed to say he came the double over them.
. In declaring a marriage between a king and queen, it is not
needful that the banns be published by a clergyman.
7. In Scotland it is dangerous to make a declaration of marriage, if
you are playing with a widow, and witnesses are present,
8. Until the last eight tricks, you need not follow suit, unless you
have the ill luck to walk behinda ...
9. Whatever points you hold you must make a point of counting
them; but you must not count point in addition to the others.
10. The game being 1000º: when a player scores that number
to 500 of his adversary, the are even at the finish, 500 to won.
* The ways of spelling this new game *. to be as various as the ways of
playing it. Bésique, Bézique, Bazique, Basique, all of these appear to be
equally in vogue, and one eccentric writer sticks, we see, to Bazouk, perhaps
from thinking it a rather boshy sort of game, and thus somehow confounding
it with a É.i, Bazouk.

A FLAT RACE.-Simpletons.
CONJUGAL CONFESSION.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - - -
No Lady's letter, cynics say, is complete without a postscript,
our best thoughts being afterthoughts. You will please observe, how.
ever, that this is an honourable exception...My husband may make
any addition he thinks fit, but for that MR. W. must be held respon-
sible, even should his hand be gently guided by mine. I only write to
gratify him, as he always smiles whether I appear in type or in tulle,
in pearl, or in small caps. MR.W. likes to see the “young idea.”
dressed in a pretty print...MR. W., I should tell you, is a City gentle-
man: he has already attained civic honours, and is therefore public
}. He sits on a Board—I am not sure that he don't sit on two
oards—but I am quite certain that when required he is never absent
from his post... His political principles are similar to my own—a light
straw colour. Before marriage he was a decided blue, but not wishing
to create disunion, and all my family being straws, he at my solici.
tation, on our weddin day, without a moment's demur, consented, to
adopt the fashionable Whig dye. -
W, is naturally * and speculative. He is so fond of
dabbling in tallow. I scold him, and then he plunges into hides. Once
or twice but for my restraining voice, he would have fallen heavily over
pig-iron, and have become involved in cotton-twist. His social feel:
ings would render him the life and spirit of any company (limited), and
impel him to join in any wild-goose chace for premiums and bonuses.
The commercial atmospherein which he moves is not healthy—it is too
hº cent—ed. -
nºyer could have acquired such control as I now exercise over
MR. W.'s financial, movements had I not, at an early period of our
union, laid down, this salutary rule. Every evening I require, and
expect that he will make a candid and unreserved confession of all his
monetary designs and deeds. . If he has taken a false step, and is
penitent, of cºurse I absolve him. Occasionally, he has to perform
penance, but that only happens when his confessions have been over-
eard by his mother-in-law.
I am perfectly aware that attorneys are generally considered best
|. to act as confessors, because they look as if they were
eeply “concerned” for suffering humanity. But an attorney, you
must remember, cannot proceed without consulting his authorities,
whereas a wife has no one to, consult but her Mamma, and has
authority enough to enforce obedience in any emergency. Some
nervous ladies would, no doubt, shrink from Stocks and Shares, as if
they were snails and spiders. Of course I can't expect their mercan-
tile consorts to make confessors of them. My friend, MRs. CREAMLEY,
has no notion at all what “Scrip” is, and MRs. SATINwood fancies
that it is something like those small pellets of silver-paper which we
sometimes find mixed with our bohea.
Now that ladies are aspiring to so many vocations for which formerly
they had little or no inclination, there is one important profession to
which I would earnestly invite their attention. I mean the office of
Public Auditors. I have seen butchers turn pale and tremble at a
very young wife's examination of their monthly bills. Think you that
Directors who had cooked, or made a hash of their accounts, could
resist the scrutiny of such auditors as MRs. PINPoINTs and MRs. 'Dots?
Would they not sink on their knees, penetrated by the indignant
glances of #. FLINT or MRs. BRIERs, whose hearts, it is well-known,
are as impenetrable as adamant, and their mental faculties as finely
pointed as their pens? Let us make the experiment.
...Another thing I would strongly recommend is that when a large
Company is in course of liquidation, a warning bell should be j
every five minutes, and after a certain interval the decanters replace
by tea, chocolate, and coffee. - -
I enclose my card, in case you should wish to communicate officially
with, Yours obediently, MARIA THERESA.
P.S.. I cordially indorse all my wife says in her excellent letter, and
think her plan of appointing female auditors excellent. As to Com-
panies in course of liquidation, I fancy their present expenditure con-
siderably exceeds what under my wife's management would be their
Tea-total expenses. FRANK.

CHAPTER THE TENTH.-OF AN ARISTOCRATIC QUARTER—DORMOUSE
MAKES A CALL-LADY DODO-STORK THE BUTLER—WE TALK IN
THE STREET AND STAND ON THE DOOR-STEP-WE ARE SHOWN
UP-STAIRS–BUTLER STORK-AND HIS GHOST.
Dawson DoRMouse, by a superhuman effort, managed to leave his
bedroom at four o'clock in the , afternoon, to get himself launched,
ToM Porcup1NE assisting, into the stream of flâneurs, and carried to
§: §. residence of the DowAGER DoDo, in the neighbourhood of
a Wiąlt.
LADY, DoDo lives in one of those compact little houses, situated in
one of those compact little streets, which stand away from the vulgar
thoroughfares with such an air of quiet aristocratic repose, that even
the careless shop-boy lowers the Fº of his shrill whistle, if, indeed,
he does not cease altogether; and his idle companion rattling with his
hoop-stick occasionally, against the area-railings with unaccustomed
timidity, finds in even this slight infraction upon the monotonous atmo-
sphere no relief to his sense of oppression, and giving it up .
trudges on, as if ghostly six-foot footmen in plush and powder were
ordering him onward; nor does he in draw breath freely,
until he turns up in Grosvenor Square, Park Lane, Bond Street,
or Piccadilly.
At almost all hours, in these streets, in some form or another, you
will, see grooms, or coachmen, or stable helps. Either they are fur-
tively coming out of area-gates, in mufti, having been, nominally, for
orders, in reality to join the domestics in the eleven o'clock beer and
bread-and-cheese (a sort of kitchen déjeuner a la fourchette very
generally, I believe, patronised by our masters below), or they are
standing on the steps of the front door, waiting to take a message, or
to receive an answer. Or the º turned out spic-and-span, and
mounted on a troublesome animal, will be holding SIR. Toby's fifteen.
one cob, which was born to carry a Bishop and splash heavily on wet
days through Rotten Row, to give the portly Churchman, exercise.
Or the coachman, looking straight before him over his immaculate stiffly
starched white tie, with a face so bright, and hard, and polished, that
it gives you the idea of his cheeks having been rather planed than
shaved before he came out, sitting, impassible as a Sphinx, on the box
of the neatly-appointed brougham, into which anyone of the residents
of that street might step without noticing that it was not his or her
own, so strong in this quarter is the family resemblance º the
yehicles. Carriages with ruby-gilled coachmen perched up aloft, look:
ing, generally, as if that eminent Judge, MR. BARQN MARTIN, had laid
aside his robes, and was taking some friends out for an airing, these
may be seen waiting for their ladies in the afternoon; but they are in
the minority as compared with broughams, and their appearance here
is usually a sign of the advent of some illustrious stranger making a
visit of ceremony.
Round the corner, at the public-house closely connected with the
mews, the employés of the stables do mostly congregate. Here is
their club, their reading-room, their lounging-room; to which the
only drawback is, that ladies are admitted, and those ladies the
matrons of the mews, or, as WAGG would say, the Mewses. (By the
way, I don't think this is quite good enough for WAGG; it's more in
ALF PooDEL’s line, who forces out the most audacious and atrocious
puns whenever he can get an opportunity, which, may his patrons and
toadies be forgiven, I regret to say is too often given him.)
A noticeable fact in this quarter is, that, they seem to love a semi;
darkness, as if they were a colony of Spiritualists, engaged in perpetual
séances. Perhaps the carpets are so rich and rare that the sun's
rays, piercing even through the smoke and fog of London, might

cause their bright colours to fade, and then—there must be new
carpets. And, new carpets here are a consideration; for, mark you,
this quarter knows not luxurious opulence. ...The residents, here
have their position, and will only surrender it with life; while, during
life, they will defend it at all points, with such weapons as studious, un-
ostentatious economy can supply. Every dowager, every bachelor,
every married pair in this quarter knows exactly, and to a fraction,
what can be done for a shilling, and what can not. Position, they say
here, is nine points of the law, and to keep it is the tenth. If you
cannot give ten dinners in the season, and keep a brougham, then give
two, and keep your brougham. If “at homes” or “drums” serve
instead of dinners, and mean two horses instead of one, and the two
are a necessity, then “at homes” and “drums” be it. A temporary
illness, a bereavement (carefully announced,) in one season, will enable
a dowager to let her house for the three months, deny herself for once,
and pay for the painting, and ing which is inevitable in the
spring of next year. Hitherto denizens of this part have been
somewhat exclusive in avoiding almost entirely any connection with
Tyburnia on the upper side. But this state has been some time
assing away, and such dowagers as LAny DoDo, finding a new pro-
ession, as it were, open to them, do not hesitate to take payment in
kind for leading and ruling in Tyburnia, which they can now do
without in anyway damaging their position, (indeed, sometimes they
can improve it,) in their own Mayfairian sphere. The LApy DoDos
find their account in taking up, from time to time, the MACAws of
Macaw, the Swallows of One Summer Hill, and such like ephemeral
celebrities.
MR. MACAw doesn’t call on LADY"Dobo, you understand, and say,
“LADY D9D0, here, is five thousand pounds, introduce me into
society: ” but MR. MACAw is interested in certain mi or railways,
or companies, or something that will pay cent, per cent, at the least,
and he advises LADY Dopo to transfer her money so advantageously
that for every hundred she received before, she would now receive
two, and, moreover, MR. MACAw, to prove his confidence in his own
speculation, offers to “hold her harmless,” and does so. So LADY
DoDo “realises,” and advertises MR. MAcaw, and he finds his account
in his generosity. And LADY Dopo wants to bind him to her, and
therefore takes his wife up, and introduces her; and when Society
once knows that this is MRs. MACAw, wife of MR. MACAw of Macaw,
who can make your h thousands, and your thousands millions,
they answer her invitations in shoals, and the aristocratic Eagles, the
Kings and Princes of Birds, wing their : MACAw’s perch, and
heartily feed with him. Ah! what fine feathers the Macaws had for
some seasons ! ... Then they moulted, and were pecked by all sorts of
birds, and then the Prince Eagles left, disdaining the carcase around which
they had gathered, and other Eagles (of the great Crooked Beak Tribe
from the East) came and chaffered, and bartered, and sold, and bought,
and pulled the nest to pieces, and there was an end of the MACAws of
acaw.
“Ah,!” exclaimed LADY DoDo, burying the MACAws out of sight,
and writing their epitaph once and for all, “I told him, from the first,
that he was too ...;
And all the above was information absolutely necessary to be given
by the cicerone who sºld DAwson DoRMouse to the DoDo's
door (oh, vile, alliteration! but let it stand, as we did on the steps),
where ToM PoRCUPINE would have left, had it not been for out
expressed wish that he should stop with us, and witness the trying
interview. For we were not there to leave cards, but actually to visit
in person LADY DoDo.
It was then we noticed the darkness of the house. Its eyelids were
half closed in a sleepy, dreamy sort of way. I have º: the
carpets, as a reason. PoRCUPINE observed it was more likely to be
“complexions,” but in the midst of our discussion the door is opened
noiselessly (I think it had been opened for some seconds before we
discovered it), and STORK, the Butler, is ready to shut us in, and
announce us to his º
“What names shall he say?” - -
We tell him what names he shall say: giving him three, from which
he selects one, masters it, and gives it clearly in the drawing-room.
The other two names Stork leaves to explain themselves.
STORK is the butler for LADY DoDo. Above the average height,
thin, and of such an ascetic pallor, that the most uncharitable could not
accuse him of undue liberties with her Ladyship's cellaret, even if he
could get at it. But, bless him, LADY Dodo is Butler over him, and
he never met his master before his engagement here.
STORK is noiseless and quick. He would in other and happier times |}.
have made an admirable executioner to the Wehmgericht, or to any secret
tribunal where an imposing appearance and great physical strength
were less an object than secresy and despatch." (I suppose this is how
they would have advertised for such an official.)
Stork has no words to throw away. His eye is quick: he knows
when to fill, and how much to pour in. If you were staying in the
house for only one night, you couldn't, on leaving, give him less than
half-a-sovereign on any pretence whatever. If you have a reputation
to keep up with LADY DoDo, so you have with Stork.
If LADY DoDo was (as she must have been) meant by nature to be a
gentlewoman, then was STORK born to be an Aristocratic Butler.
There are, Nature's Noblemen: there are Nature's Butlers. Like
clings to like; money attracts money; and a kindred aristocratic sym-
pathy united Stoºk to LApy Dodo. See him behind her Ladyship's
chair. On my word, there is a family resemblance. . Both are thin,
both are pale, or both would be, had not LADY DoD9 the advantage of
twenty years' seniority, and the excuse of her sex for the addition of
the slightest soupçon possible of colour on her withered cheek, and of
powder for filling up Time's furrows. StoRK’s face has been furrowed
too, but very neatly done, less indeed the work of Time's plough than
of the Old Gentleman, as an artist, drawing carefully on wood, and
leaving a great deal to be finished in a year or two. -
Stork is the sort of man who ’t be a ghost; or, if allowed to
revisit this earth, like Hamlet’s father, he would be shaken hands with,
and welcomed as the very STORK. He º tell thern he was a
ghost; no one would believe him any more than we should now if he
turned round upon us on the stairs, and announced such a fact.
Figure to yourselves, my readers, such an after-existence—a ghost
ing to and fro over this earth, and never able to get any one to
lieve in him. Bah! The Wandering Jew is nowhere by the side of
such a romance.
Say StoRK dies; STORK is buried on Tuesday;
ourth
StoRk turns up on
Wednesday night, just as you’re going to bed. Hullo, STORK,” you
say, not a # flightened, “what do you want at this time—eh?” .
"I am a ghost,” returns STORK, in sep al tones. You smile,
and think how absurd it is for Stoak to t to be funny.
“Oh, by the way, STORK, as you are here, I'll send a note by you to
LApy, DoDo; ”, and thereupon, down you sit to write the letter—
probably something about a dinner-party. STORK sighs, and, while
Yºº are inditing, your epistle, vanishes. You look up. He is gone.
‘Queer fellow that, StoRk,” you say. “Wrong in his head, I’m
afraid. Pity. Capital servant.” And you turn into bed.
If STORK would do this it would confer, a great benefit on a society
largely inclined to superstition, and would do more to rain the whole
fraternity of Ghosts and Spirits than all the sneers of all the sceptics
that have ever existed. -
We are now coram LADY DoDo, and STORK has retired.
Now lest it should be inferred by impatient readers, that, of Goosey
BARNDoor and Miss IDA DRAKE they will hear no more, it behoves
the writer to tell them that such inference is wrong, and, further, to
refer them to MR. EDITOR PUNCH for his philosophic definition of the
term Space, as applied to these columns.

JUDGE v. JURY.
HAs a Judge the right to criticise in Court the verdict of a jury?
This question is suggested by what passed at a late trial at the
Middlesex Sessions, when—
G º jury retired, and after great deliberation found the prisoner Not
uilty.
“MR. PAYNE. Not guilty, Gentlemen! Well, after that verdict there will
be no protection for the public. If you believe the Prosecutrix, why, the
p." is guilty. She swears positively to him, and says she had seen him
efore.
“The Forest AN. We were not satisfied with the identity, my Lord.
“MR. PAYNE. Let the Prosecutrix stand up again.”
Trial by jury has been long regarded by many a British orator as one
of the chief bulwarks of the British Constitution. But if Judges bring
their juries into the Court's contempt, the moral strength of such a
bulwark will be sensibly diminished. Perhaps in the above case the
Judge may have been right and the jurymen all Nº. although the
odds were twelve to one against that supposition. A Judge may charge
a jury to the muzzle as he pleases, but, when their verdict is delivered,
it is not his business again to open fire on them. It is his duty very
often to pronounce a judgment on a prisoner, but he has no right to
pronounce a judgment on a jury.

SOUND PORT AND PRINCIPLES.
AIR-" The Vicar of Bray.”
I AM an old and sound divine,
Amongst a few surviving
Who still adhere to old port wine,
To get it genuine striving.
As much as I do find suffice,
I go on drinking daily;
And this is always .. advice:
O stick to Port and PALEY |
When good port wine was, long ago,
The Clergyman's potation,
Church parties }. both High and Low,
And practised, moderation.
But when from port they fell away,
To my dissatisfaction,
The Low Church rose, and had its day,
And then ensued reaction.
When eyes were bright that now are dim,
And heels that halt went skipping;
The man at Cambridge called a “Sim”
Was noted tea for sipping;
At Oxford, whilst the other school,
Thereat first ground then gaining,
Ağ. themselves to live by rule,
rom their port wine abstaining.
Had every one to port alone
Continued still a true man,
Tractarianism had never grown
Of PUSEY and of NEWMAN.
No Ritualists had made a fuss
Of vestments and of candles,
Nor would that ass, IGNATIUs,
Have sported frock and sandals.
No Essays and Reviews had seen
The light, if such true nectar
Their authors’ constant drink had been
As what once warmed each Rector.
The liquor of Oporto's grape
Had ne'er perverted men so:
But lo it was exchanged for Cape'
And that inspired ColeNso.
Port wine would have kept Popery
Within our Church a stranger;
And no occasion there would be
To cry “The Church in Danger!”
The Irish Branch intact had stayed,
Establishment and treasure :
'Tis GLADstone's claret that has made
The way for GLADSTONE's measure.
Now England's Clergy, as of old,
No more drink port, no wonder
A first step taken you behold
The Church and State to sunder.
And port is §§ scarce and dear.

That wine will fail; their end is near :
They’ll last my time, however.

CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.-INTERVIEW WITH THE DODO-THE PRE-
PARATIONS FOR THEATRICALS-WHO WAS TO BE WHO-HOW TBIE
LITTLE DUCK CAME IN–AND GOOSEY—NIPPER—WAGG-PORCUPINE
—MUCH ABOUT MISS CATHERINE CHESSER – REEIEARSAL COM-
MENCES-THE MISSES RABBITS.
It was settled by LADY Dopo, on behalf of MRs. MACAw, at our
interview, that we were all to do our best to assist in the theatricals
which were to be given at the MACAws’ house. ToM PorcupiNE was
to be Stage Manager, and to draw out the programme, which was to
consist of an operetta and a farce. In the course of the evening PAUL
PARROT was to F. his, imitations, WAGG was to amuse the people
and make himself generally useful, ALF PooDEL was to play in the farce
with #. NIPPER, who was also to sing the funny part in the operetta
preceding.
MR. RATTELs NAYRE was cast, of course, for the tenor, with MRs.
BYRDE as his soprano to be made love to. Miss KATE CHEsseB was
to be in the farce, and both Miss LAMBKIN and Miss GAZELLE in the
operetta, DoRMouse was to play an elderly gentleman, and after it was
arranged what everyone should play, the important question started by
MR. KYNG FYscHER, whose operetta it was, arose as to who should
| play the piano. MRs. ByRDE couldn’t, and wouldn’t; she couldn’t
act, sing, and play too. That was evident—the other young ladies said
the same. A professional pianist was all very well for a quadrille, or
dancing generally, when he could take his sherry and sandwiches, and
§ { mechanically in a corner for hours together, with his eyes shut.
ut to accompany singing, -to “humour the voices,” said KYNG
FYscHER, “that’s another thing.”
“Would he do it, then,” asked LADY DoDo, a suggestion which was
firmly, but civilly declined.
Here DoRMoûsº put in a word. (By the way, he had brought
Goosey as one of his “clever friends who was first-rate in anything of
the sort,” and who had consequently been set down for Mr. Augustus
de Montmorency in the farce, and a remorseful Bandit in the operetta.)
DoRMouse said that the Governess at his father's house was just
the very º do it, to oblige, with pleasure; and, in fl.
so lauded her, that he nearly roused even MRs, MACAw's suspicions;
and as for LADY DoDo, she placed her old hand on his, and said, with
an approving smile, “You shall bring her then, my dear, to rehearsals.
What is her name?” Whereupon IDA DRAKE was mentioned, and

poissons d’Avril. Then, and you must not be surprised if your state-
ment causes some astonishment, announce that . GLADSTONE, out
of respect for MR. WALPoLE's feelings, and impressed by LoRD
GeoRGE HAMILTON's mature convictions, has written to MR. Dis-
RAELI, offering to withdraw the Irish Church Bill, and to substitute
a measure, enabling all the Hibernian Bishops to have seats in the
House of Lords, and making attendance at the services of the Esta-
blished Church compulsory, at least four times a year, on every one
who contributes to the Grand Jury Cess. (It is understood at the
Clubs and drinking fountains, that in return for this courteous be-
haviour, MR. WARD HUNT has engaged to abstain from demolishing
MR. Lowe's Budget, and that SIR. John PAKINGTON and MR. Mow-
BRAY. have relieved MR. BRIGHT of a source of much uneasiness, by
promising, in the handsomest manner, never to follow him in debate.)
You will gratify those of your hearers who are Conservatives by
assuring them that the DUKE of MARLBoRough has consented to
introduce in the Upper House (by way of ## “Peers, Idle Peers,”
something to do) a }. for the abolition of Primogeniture early in the
spring of 1870.
Military men will be interested to hear that H.R.H. the DUKE of

To a right-minded Ritualist the announcement that LoRD SHAFTEs:

removing from our churches all ornaments, vessels, and vestments
which were not in use in the time of KING Épwººd THE CONFEsso

the delighted Caffres.

but as a hint to . MACAw as to how she was to comport herself
towards the young person, who was such a Godsend, you know, at the
É. At these rehearsals, then, it will be at once seen that MR. Goosey
ARNDooB, being very strict and punctual in his attendance (for had
he not two mighty difficult parts to º ?) was continually meeting
Miss IDA. There was a song for the remorseful Bandit, I remember
when he falls in love with the Seconda Donna (whom he had been paid
to waylay, and did;, paid also to murder, and didn’t), and sings, “Ah,
hine eyes! They teach me how to love!” which Goosey was for
|ever trying over to Miss DRAKE's accompaniment, in order, as he said,
to master the true expression of feeling, which the words (words by
ALF PooDEL) were intended to convey. -
BYRDE, a quiet elderly gentlemanſ from the City, about fifteen
years, at least, MRs: BYRDE's, senior, accepted the office of Prompter,
as LADY Dodo had previously arranged with MRs. MACAw. But as
the rehearsals were very seldom fixed for an hour when he could
“attend in his place,” the prompting was done by different people at
different times; and MR. BYRDE coming once to a night rehearsal, fell
asleep at the fifth page and fourth hour of the operetta, and snored
loudly during the great duett, for which he was very properly reproved
by his wife. He did not fill the post again until the night of perform-
ance, when, as might have been expected, he knew rather less of the
F. and where the actors were likely to “stick,” than he would
ave, perhaps, of the first verb in a Hebrew Grammar, had he been
asked to conjugate; “a task,” as PooDEL would say, “ which he would
at once decline.” (If PooDEL had said this, WAGG would have taken
off his hat respectfully, and explained to the bystanders that he always
... saluted such very old friends as PooDEL was fond of introducing.”
Whereat ALF PooDEL would smile, abashed, not daring to show
annoyance, lest he should only expose himself to some more cruciblow
at the hands of the merciless AGG.)
I recollect some advertisement to the effect that “No breakfast-table
complete without somebody's celebrated something or other,” I forget
what; but this is the formula which I would use as applicable to almost
all the amateurs above mentioned: specially NIPPER. If, as you re-
member, a place at a dinner-party is vacant, send for Kocky Robbins:
if you want to start theatricals, send for NIPPER. If, however, you want
your entertainment to be as near perfection as possible, don't rely upon
IPPER's recommendations for your other performers.

verbial. They get their bread by the stage; and a funny man, or a
tragic man, may be robbed by a funnier or a more tragic man of his
crumbs. A Droll may be at the top of the tree; still there is the tree
below him, and a Droller than he may climb up, and displace him,
whereby the Droll's income is considerably diminished, and MRs.
DRoll will have to pinch, and the little DROLLs not be able to go to
school next half. So you see one is not very much surprised if a pro-
fessionally comic, or tragic, man speak disparagingly of his fellow crafts-
man; that is, if theiatterbè rising, and with more than probable chances
of ultimate success in his favour. But it is remarkable that one should
find precisely the same kind of charity and good feeling among the
amateurs of any art—notably, however, of the dramatic, “Oh, heaven!
how these Christians do love one another l’ cries ToM Porcupine, after
discussing, in his character of Stage Manager, the question of who
was to be who at MRs. MACAw's theatricals. “It’s Bottom all over
again, Snug the Joiner, and all the rest of 'em,” says ToM, “SHAKES-
PEARE must have begun as an amateur, or he 'd never have known so
much about it.”
And indeed NIPPER, eminently comic, no sooner hears of the
Heavy Father who has some tender and pathetic speeches in the piece,
than he immediately wants to throw up the Funny Waiter's part (who
hides in a box, you know) and take that of old Martin Graylocks.
He is again unsettled on reading the Villain's part (which was
originally played by the great tragedian GRowLER when he was a
younger man), and he can’t help observing that he should like to have
layed that. ToM PoncUPINE, however, fixes him in the Comic
Taiter. “Hang it!” says NIPPER, “I’m always a Comic Waiter.”
But he knows, the sly dog, that it is the part in the piece, and that having
seen BUCKSTONE in it #. times at least, he can, without troubling
his originality, reproduce the chief points of that excellent comedian’s
performance, “without their being recognised,” as that satiric WAGG
whispers in an aside to MRs. ByRDE. AGG is not asked to act, but
drops in at rehearsals, as amicus curiae, and a precious nuisance he is.
Iss CATTERINE CHEsser is a handsome young lady somewhat
j the character of Mr. William Taylor, drawn in that cele-
brated ballad as being
“Full of mirth and full of spree,”
E.; always, that “spree” is understood as never passing the
unds of propriety. Miss CHEsser’s only chaperon is her theatrical
reputation: it guards her everywhere, it travels with her all over
England. Her parents may thank Heaven that, so to speak, the Comic
Muse has stood godmother to their CATHERINE, and has provided for
her for life. She is as full of engagements as a Professional Star.
“She is so goodnatured: she is so useful: she is so clever,” say the
matrons who get up these parties, and at whose houses Miss CHESSER
is a great attraction. In fact, though they cannot exactly advertise in
print, yet the MRs. MACAws of society will be careful to get it well put
about that Miss CHEsser is ; to play, and then there is a rush of
the best young men of her following.
Miss CHEsseR has a really strong appreciation of humour tempered
by a woman's gentleness. Thus NIFFER, as a perpetual Droll, sends
her off “into fits,” as she expresses it, when he only asks for the salt,
or offers his opinion on the probable weather of the day after to-morrow.
But she gives no more than a smile to WAGG’s repartees, while of Tom
PonçUPINE’s sarcasms she is simply afraid; but then ToM will force a
satirical meaning (as I have shown already) into everything, and as
Miss CHESSER will “roar ” and “scream” at NIPPER's, or even ALF
PooDEL's saying “How d'ye do?” so she will “be sure MR. Porcu-
PINE means something satirical” when ToM salutes her with precisely
the same words. If there is one thing above another she enjoys, it is a
hearsal, NIPPER comes on in the character, not in the dress. . He
says his first line, and gives his queer look out of the corners of his
eyes at MIss CHESSER, who is the Chambermaid. Safe laugh, that
queer look.
“Oh don't MR. Nº. she cries, struggling, with almost irre-
pressible laughter, and utterly unable to proceed with her words. ..
“What is it, Miss CHEssert?” inquires that dog NIPPER, pretending
to be perfectly unconscious of his comic power, and doing it again.
“I shall, never be able to go on,” says the young lady, whereat
NIPPER, still feigning ignorance of the cause, becomes funnier than
ever.
“I know I should scream if I was in front when you were acting,”
she says; at which avowal NIPPER smiles, deprecatingly, but on, con-
i. the matter over, going home, acknowledges to himself that it
is wonderful what a comic power he has, and lor! what a fortune he
would have made on the stage.
“My sister says,” Miss CHEssER tells NIPPER, “that when you
came on with that red wig the other night at the FRYs', she shrieked.”
NIPPER is delighted to hear it, though again he only smiles depre-
catingly, as much as to say, “Oh, dear no. I’m sure—’tisn’t so
tery funny—only you’re good enough to say so.”—and thereby he
gets, with some folks, a reputation for modesty. - -
By the way, when Miss CHEsser tells him that her sister, “shrieked”
and she “screamed,” she only means to convey her idea of being
immensely amused, and laughing most heartily.
And both the CHESSER girls can do this, and are not simperers like
the Miss RABBITs, who snigger behind their pocket-handkerchiefs, or
smile, and then look round to see if any one else is smiling too, as
though your witticism was something of a dubiously proper character.

OUR HABITUAL CRIMINALS.
ERY ONNERD PUNCH,
Aving been a pick
º almost from my
irth, I may call myself a
member of the criminal per-
suasion, tho I calls myself
a cobler when I'm brort
before the Beak. As sich,
I feels a matral hintrest in
the progress of the bill for
§ putting down abittual cri-
|Nº|| minals, and º the
shops of them as deals in
stolen goods. Well, all as
I can say is if you shut up
the receeivers you’ll soon
shut up the thieves, for as
I says to CHARLEY CLY-
FAKER what’s the good
o’ prigging tickers when
there’s nobody to sell 'em
to ? We shovellers of in-
dustry,” as our lively
neighbours calls us, in
course must find that
clyfaking is all a waste of
labour, when there ain’t
no market open where we
can sell the swag. To us old prigs it seems a pity our indoostry should
be wasted, and all our skill and science which has costus so much trouble
be found of no more use. But I spose we must regard ourselves as
wictims of Society, and if Society have only the pluck to get the steam
up, I shouldn't be surprised at the fulfilment of a prophecy I lately saw
in print—
“Five years of correct legislation, capable administration and adequate ex-
penditure, and crime as a profession might be extinguished in Great Britain.”
To pass a law to take a cove's bread out of his mouth aint what I
consider as “correct legislation.” But we pore martyrs, must submit
to be extinguished if Society insists, and I’m doubtful if Society will
ive us compensation, i. rogues as bad as we have ad it afore now.
ut while Society's about it, there are other thieves than us pore prigs
as ort to be looked arter, Pray, aint there thieves in bubble companies
who prey upon the public quite as much as we do? Aint there habitual
criminals in the money-lending line, whom Society would do well to
put under surveillance? Aint there rogues in grain who adulterate
their bread, or put poison in their beer, and rob people of their health
as well as of their money? Aint there rogues who rig the market, and
trade upon a panic, and care nothing for the widows and the orphans
whom they ruin Aint there fraudulent directors, and fraudulent
trustees, and fraudulent tradesmen, who buy their goods from fraudu-
lent bankrupts, or who swindle poor folks by selling them? Afore you
brags of the “ hextinction of crime” by act of parliament, you must hit
\}. a plan for extinguishing sich criminals like them as Iave named.
Why shouldn't money-lending swindlers and rogues who sell short
measure have a ticket o' leave given 'em, arter proof of first olº,
the same as prigs and burglars who have served their time in quod
They are all habitual criminals every bit as much as me and CHARLEY

Papal Toys.
Anſong “Notes from Rome” in the Pall Mall Gazette, it is stated
that “CARDINAL MATHIEu, Archbishop of Besançon, has lately brought
to Rome a considerable number of breech-loaders as a present to the
Pontifical Government.” Of course these breech-loaders are mere
laythings. A Pius could have as little use for any other as an

childhood. And Papa's breech-loaders, of course, are only Pope-guns.

CURIOSITIES OF NATURAL HISTORY.
(By a Casual Contributor.)
1. The Perverse Mouse.—One evening a young lady was playing a
waltz on the piano when a small mouse came out of a hole near the
grate, and danced a polka, Not being in the least alarmed, the young
lady... a polka, but the mouse immediately danced a waltz. On
her discontinuing, the mouse retired and was never seen again.
2. Sagacity in Whales.—In the North the winter is a hard season for
whales, which can barely obtain a subsistence. A sailor once saw a
whale spouting.” Being observed, the monster dived suddenly, and
the sailor vainly searched for the ticket. It is supposed that it must
have been taken with him.
3. The Bashful Cat.—A cat once being alone with a fiddle, played
three tunes, on it beautifully. Seeing a stranger, however, listening,
she laid it down, and would never, for any amount of coaxing, take it
up again.
4. The Bullfinch.-The Bullfinch is a cross between a Bull, and a
Finch. There is more of the Finch in it than the Bull, and some
naturalists have entertained the opinion that, if killed at a proper season,
it would furnish a small family with very excellent beef.
5. The Butterfly.—A similar observation (to the above) may be made
in the case of the Butterfly. They are excellent substitutes for cows,
as their name implies, i 0 dairy should ever be without a good
supply of this delicate and useful insect.
6. The Modest Centipede.—A Centipede was lately seen entering a
tailor's shop. It was reported that it, ordered fifty pairs of light
summer trousers. The prevalent belief is that the Modest Insect had
been much affected by the Lord Chamberlain's edict about lengthening
§: ballet-dresses. We cannot, however, vouch for the exact truth of
e story.
7. The Arithmetical Snake-A Countryman was one day much
alarmed at hearing a snake doing a sum. On examining the reptile
cautiously, it proved to be an Adder. This, it should be noted, took
place in Summer.
A RUBRICKALL READYNGE.
In a right sensible address to his clergy, the Most Reverend the
ARCHBIshop of York, touching a matter in controversy, whereon some-
what hath been unduly drawn from the late judgment of the Privy
Council, well saith :—
“But this was never argued before the court; which would have had,
before deciding it, to consider on which side is ‘before the table,” since that
another rubric leaves the precise position of the table undefined; also whether
‘before the table” means more than “at the table.’”
Truly a man may stand before a chair, because if he stand on the
other side thereof, he shall stand behind it; but he cannot stand behind
a table, for a table, look you, hath no back. Every man who is at a
table needs must have the table before him, whether it be round, or
square, or oblong, mark you that. . The Chairman at a dinner sitteth
| before the table, and so doth the vice; so do the º sit likewise
on either hand. You shall stand, indeed, before a table as to your
beholders if you stand between it and them, and that alike whether you
stand with your back to the table or to the beholders. Go to, then.
An you be at a table, and not before the table, then must you be either
on the table or else under the table, where, † masters, may none of
you ever be found. Save you, Sirs; joy be with you: and so farewell.

|A NEW AMERICAN DRINK, OR AMERICANISED
CLARET.
, AMONG the arts cultivated in the Republic which we
have had proposed to us as a political and social model,
there is one }. might be called the art of adulteration,
only that it is more than that. Adulteration is the admix-
ture of rubbish with genuine goods. The American art
which transcends it is the simple substitution of sham for
reality. Its first recorded fruits were wooden nutmegs,
and now, according to the British Medical Journal, we are
actually instructed by one of its learned professors at a
scientific Institute:–
“How to MARE CLARET.-At the meeting of the Polytechnic
Association of the American Institute on the 7th of January,
during a discussion on the adulteration of wines, DR. WAN DER
WEYDE is reported by the Chemical News to have described a
mode of making claret, viz., by allowing water to soak through
shavings, and adding thereto a certain proportion of logwood
and tartaric acid. This produced a wine hardly to be distin-
guished in flavour and colour from claret.”
An eminent statesman has declared his belief that adul-
teration is very little practised in England. Need he have
been, ashamed to acknowledge the fact that it is very
| largely practised indeed? He glories in the idea that we
are Americanising all of our institutions. Suppose we also
Americanise our commodities. We shall then go beyond
merely adulterating them. Adulteration will be no longer
our national reproach. Our national boast will be Ameri-
Canlsation.

MY IDEA.
(A Flash / a Dash / and an Appeal /)
At Five o'clock precisely, or if not precisely, thereabouts, an Idea
struck me—a grand, a glorious, a splendid Idea.
It was the thing. It was what I had seen long ago would make my
fortune. I jumped from my chair and said, “By Jove, that’s it!”
I saw how to carry it out, clearly. . In a second everything connected
with the Idea flashed before my mind's eye, as we hear a drowning
man views a panorama of his entire past life in an inappreciable frac-
tion of time.
I paced my room—I looked out of the window—it must be done
at once. No time must be lost. Paper, pens, ink; meet it is I set

Another word. My hand moves unwillingly, my thoughts will not
direct it; º grip is firm on the pen—my will is iron. Words will
come, yes, they do come, but none express my Idea.
Am I to lose a fortune, hundreds, thousands, millions, perhaps,
because I can’t fix this Idea and develope it on paper?
Stay, let me think it out, and then develope it. My long German
pipe, my arm chair; out of the draughts and comfortably before the fire.
The days are drawing out, but duskiness º: on apace. * * * *

Idea. There are difficulties in the way of carrying out my Idea.

If anyone can help me, I should feel personally obliged to them.

hands cold, feet cold, head warm, leaning back in arm-chair, a little
drowsy, no noise, no distraction, sunset outside (but nothing to do
with me, that hasn't), and an arm-chair with nobody in it opposite side
of the rug. There’s the picture : in this position I was struck by
the Great Idea. - -
If any one of your numerous readers will give me his notion on the
subject, I shall be for ever grateful. Any suggestion might recover the

PUNCH has groaned o'er the Black Country’s gloom,
That from body has gathered to soul,
Has spoken his mind of it plainly,
Has sharply been called o'er its coal.
But he owes the Black Country a lesson,
That from depth of its darkness is given,
Of trust in the goodness of God,
And the love of our Father in Heaven.
As they toiled in the deep-driven mine,
Came the rush and the roar far away,

And the black flood 'twixt them and the day.
Thick and thicker the air to the breath—
Dim and dimmer the lights to the eye–
High and higher the wave at their foot—,.

Slowly dragged the dull hours, as they sat
Huddled close by the lip of the flood,
As light after light dimm'd and died, .
And the cold crept and crept on their blood.
'Twas at five, Wednesday night the flood came,
Their last light died next morn before seven,
And up-spoke STEPHEN PAGE in the dark,
“Lads, our lights are not put out in Heaven.”
They have prayed, as men pray, from whom hope,
Save in God and his goodness, is fled;
Written farewells to children and wives,
To be found, when Earth gives up her dead.
Calm they wait God’s good time, all save one,
In whom º o'er manhood had sway,
Till in darkness without and within,
That crazed life ebbed in ravings away.
Fouler still grew the air: quickened breath,
In the darkness, with i. they drew
With their mouths to the face of the flood,
Where a thin pulse of sweet air came through.
And they knew by the faintly heard clank
That the pumps were at work night and day,
And cold hands felt the ranged coals, that told
How the flood, inch by inch, ebbed away!
Inch by inch, hour by hour! It was hard
Of those ebbs which would win to divine;
That of life's stream, in slowly dulled veins
That of death's stream, in slowly drained mine.

There is little to give; it is given.

What's that?–In the hush—Can it be?

And of all that ten thousand tense souls,
No soul but is offering its prayer.

From crowd-edge to crowd-end flashes through—
They are found; they’re alive ; from the cage

And a shout sends the news to and fro.

PUBLIC SERVICES REWARDED 2
THE Eastern Post, no doubt well posted up in trustworthy rumours,
makes the following announcement:—
“THE LEADERs of THE REForM LEAGUE.—We are informed that M.R.
BEALEs, late President of the Reform League, will shortly receive a County
Court Judgeship. It is said that MR. Howell, the late Secretary to that
body, has been appointed private secretary to a Member of Parliament.”
This, if true as stated, is as it should be. It was well and wisely
done, too, if done at all, to liberate the Fenian prisoners without
tickets of leave. See, one may say, how a generous confidence has
been justified by demonstrative gratitude. Never again will roughs
need an invitation to mob the House of Commons. Never, under any
circumstances, will Hyde Park railings go down any more, or prison-
walls and poor º in {i,j or elsewhere, be blown up.

BERWICK WORKHOUSE ECONOMY.
A SMALL bird has informed us that an extraordinary meeting of the
Berwick Poor-Law Guardians was held the other day for the purpose
of taking into consideration an answer, the only one received, to a
certain remarkable notification, lately published by them, of being in
want of a medical officer and a workhouse porter. It ran as follows:–
“GENTLEMEN, -By an announcement which has appeared in several
of the journals, faminformed that you desire to engage the services of
a medical officer, and also of a porter. To the former you offer. £25
a #. out of which he will be required to pay for all the medicine
which he supplies, except cod-liver oil, and you expect candidates for
his appointment to attend before you at the election day at their own
cost. To the latter you offer £20 a year, with board and lodging.
... I *f to propose myself, conditionally, as a candidate for the situa:
tion of your medical officer. Circumstances, peculiarly narrow, will
preclude the possibility of my attendance at your. Board, where, if I
could attend, perhaps I might not find any competitor. Accordingly,
should no applicant present himself, a line addressed to me as below,
accepting the proposal I am about to make to you, could summon me
immediately; and I would be with you punctually on the First of
April.
For the place of workhouse porter, I apprehend that you will expe.
rience no want of applications, it being obviously by much the more
eligible of the two. In case your views could be met by the combina-
tion of both officials in one person, allow me to propose myself to you
as ready to constitute that one. You would then obtain the advantage
of a resident medical officer, whose duties, as porter, too, would not
forbid his visiting patients in the receipt of outdoor relief, because his
calls, would occur chiefly during the night, and in the meanwhile,
whether by night or day, paupers and tramps seeking admission might
wait, as also might patients, whenever you, Gentlemen, arranged to
visit the workhouse. - -
My poverty prevents me, from . offering to perform your medical

will allow me to undertake both of those employments in union—may

THE Admiralty are advertising that they will receive tenders for
“Ivory Combs.” Our belief in MR. CHILDERs, as an economical
reformer has been great, but if he is aware of this piece of reckless

withdrawn, Punch wiſdoubt his sincerity. We are quite at sea as to ||
who can possibly require “Ivory. Combs”—My Lords, or officers |

House and Whitehall? Whoever the requisitionists may be, we put it
to them whether, in the present state of the national finances, they
ought not to be satisfied with a less expensive material–horn, or gutta

ivory-backed hair-brushes, and other toilet requisites of the same costly
description, be also furnished at the public expense 2

The almanacks called
it Easter, but a decent
Easter would be
ashamed of such
weather, and besides,
a pantomime has just
been produced at
Drury Lane—it was
Christmas, werepeat,
and it is over. The
House of Commons
met again on
April 1, Thursday.
That is, a few of them
came, and stayed for
a short time. Attor-
ney - General SIR
Robert Colli ER
announced that the
Judges’ report
against Norwich and
Bridgewater was so
strong that we must
have two Commis-
sions to inquire into
the evil doings in
those places. Some local men protested, but MR. HARDY declared that
the House must stand by the Judges, and the Commissions were agreed
to. If we have any influence with our respected contemporaries of the
daily press, we would ask them, when the investigation is going on,
not to waste their valuable space and irritate our valuable temper with
column after column of report of low, vulgar, and paltry exposures, but
merely to sum the matter up with a line to the effect that “another
batch of Norwich cads to-day made shameless confession of their
malpractices.” Why should the sayings and doings of such animals be
recorded as history? ..
The Bill for the Abolition of Imprisonment for Debt was brought in,
but as its parent did not make a speech about it, Mr. Punch will await
his explanations. It would seem that the Prison is to be reserved only
for those monsters of crime and contumaciousness who fail to obey the
decree of the County Court.
Friday., Still they didn't come, but there were quite enough to
carry on debate until past one in the morning. A sensible question was
put to MR. LAYARD by SIR HARRY VERNEY about the protection of
ancient monuments in this country, and the Chief Commissioner of
Works made an earnest º: stating that he had asked the Royal
Society to write him out a ſist of the monuments requiring public
protection. This Lord STANHope had undertaken should be done. He
alluded to DUNSTAN the Wandal who recently destroyed the Tölmen in
Cornwall, in whose favour Mr. Punch last week expressed the hearty wish
that the next time DUNSTAN and the Enemy contend, the latter ma
f. hold of DUNSTAN's nose, instead of the affair going as in the legend:
ut it is useless, as PETER PINDAR said, to whip pigs with velvet, and
nothing that Mr. Punch or MR. LAYARD can say could affect DUNSTAN.
Still, the parson of his parish might be down on him with the bit from
the Commination Service about the curse that resteth upon him who
destroyeth his neighbours’ landmark, explaining to him, for his dismay
that the Tôlmen was a landmark for everybody. ... If the revered
gentleman will frighten DUNSTAN into “the horrors,” Punch will make
a handsome present to the church school,
, , MR..CHARLEs Buxton raised a question about an appointment in
the Mint. He was completely answered by MR. DISRAELI, who had
made that *Hºº. and MR. Buxton was told by MR. GLApstone
to shut up. The only points that concern the reader are two. First, the
young gentlemen at the head of the Foreign Office are declared to be
young gentlemen of the Tºº intelligence, assiduity, and perse-
verance; and, secondly (and this is useful to people who write novels
of political life), when “a man” (said DISRAELI) becomes leader of the
House he is allowed two private secretaries, and one of them is ap:
pointed from the office with which he himself is connected, and without
reference to politics. When MR. DISRAELI's private secretary first
entered his room in that capacity, the late PREMIER had not the honour
of his acquaintance, nor did he even now know the gentleman's {..",
tics. Note this, authors and she-authors, that§. may not describe a
Minister's private secretary as some pet of Mrs. Minister's, selected
for his Adonis looks, and that you may not make him suddenly spring
from his desk, and in an access of H. politics reveal to his
employer a scheme for overthrowing the Constitution.
hen the Navy Estimates were taken, and ships were talked all the
evening. The Government are bent upon building two grand, sea-
going turret-ships that will go anywhere, and they will not build any
more wooden men-of-war. MR. CoRRY, the late First Lord, denounced
these great ships, and read heaps of letters from sea-officers, who pre-
dicted that they would be useless. But on division MR. CHILDERs
was ordered to have his own way by 122 to 46. There was also a good
deal of controversy about recent Admiralty changes and reforms, but on
the whole the Committee of Supply thought that the Administration
was on the right tack;
The Budget is to follow, MRs. GRUNDy, and of course the Income Tax
as before, MRs. GRUNDY, and lucky if it isn’t increased, MRs.

MATRIMONIAL AGENCY BALLS.
A Lecture delivered at the Pumpford Social Science Institute.
BY PROFESSOR BUCKLE.
GENTLEMEN and Ladies, I have the honour to propose the institution
of Matrimonial Agency Balls.
The one sole object with which grown-up persons in general go to
balls is matrimony, either for themselves, or the girls they take with
them. But you may go with your daughters to a public ball, and not
find a *:: eligible partner, that you know, for one of them in the
room. There is the H. of tickets, amounting, perhaps, to several
guineas, gºne for nothing. There is also the cost of dresses and deco-
rations. This I call ...; away powder and shot; besides which
you are kept up until perhaps four in the morning.
All this waste of time and money would be saved at a Matrimonial
Aº. Ball. -
The ball might either be got up through subscription, or given, on
speculation, by a Matrimonial Agent, or Ågency Company. Allow me to
mention a few of the arrangements which would be requisite to work it.
Let a hall or gallery be provided in which the photographs of persons
designing to attend the ball, may, if they please, be exhibited. Each
portrait to be accompanied with a statement of terms, requirements,
qualifications, capabilities, and so forth. As for example:—
. No. 1.-Man of sixty. Wife wanted, young and beautiful. ... His
income, from safe investments, £20,000 a year. Will settle all his
property, and her own, if she have any, on herself.
I hope, Gentlemen, that there is not one among you who entertains
so low a view of humanity in its fairest form as to think that the original
of the photograph thus ticketed would be in a position to throw the
handkerchief to any single lady in the Matrimonial Agency Ball-room,
unless he had a competitor still more opulent than himself, or one
equally rich, but older. I trust, too, that none of you would ven-
ture the insinuation that the bare statement of particulars, in such
a case, would suffice, and no photograph be necessary. Wei. now
imagine a Candidate of a contrary description; a handsome young
man, entered as:—
No 2–Captain in a Cavalry Regiment. Longs for a domestic life,
but can't afford it. Would undertake to make any rational woman happy.
Here you see would be a chance for an heiress who might or ºt
not be beautiful and accomplished as well; for an old maid, no matter
how old, if wealthy; or for a rich widow. Given a maintenance, the
gallant Captain, we may suppose, would not look any gift horse in the
mouth. e cases I have imagined are extremes. . A variety of others
may be conceived... A nobleman might have a title to bestow on the
best bidder. Intellect might be desired by some men—mere beauty by
others. Then men have fancies in these matters. One is particular
about eyes, another cares for complexion, another r s figure
rather : this man thinks most of a face, that of a foot and ankle. All
these men, in stating circumstances and requirements, could specify
their peculiar vanities—for oh, my friends, are they not vanities
after all P Why now, I can fancy a gentleman registering himself
and his predilection simply as :—
No. 3. Artist. Admirer of RUBENs and ETTY. Embonpoint.
As to the ladies º attend a Matrimonial Agency Ball,
their pictures alone would say quite enough, with a very few exceptions,
such as when the hope of a husband is based on culinary skill, or some
other utility, or accomplishment, or on £ s. d., Marriage is, and always
will be, most f. living; their faces being their fortunes, as the say-
ing is. For what man, in these days, can possibly afford to give his
daughter a portion that would be of material use to anybody but a
small shopkeeper ? Everyone wants to spend much more than he is
able. The professions may, as SocietyP. get thrown more and
more open to the better half of mankind, and Posterity will perhaps see a
woman on the Woolsack. But, for a long time, the field of female
industry will remain restricted to that old vocation wherein obtainin
employment would be #. facilitated by the institution of Matri-
j'. Balls. Patresſamiliarum—Matreyamiliarum. / Parents
Guardians! } earnestly hope, that the realisation of the idea whiciſ
have now suggested will enable you to economise time and money in
securing matrimony.

“IT WAs LUCKY THE WIND BLEw on Shore, or CERTAINLY SOME OF US WOULD
HAVE BEEN TAKEN ouT TO SEA l’’
A SMASH FOR THE SEED SWINDLERS.
WITH lamb at thirteen pence a pound, and beef and
mutton at eleven pence, there are certainly substantial
reasons why a man who is not rich should become a
vegetarian. Instead of doing so, however, nine men out
of ten would prefer to see meat cheaper, and will welcome
any means whereby it may become so. A hot summer
and short crops of clover, grass, and turnips, are by some
people alleged to be a cause of the high prices, and perhaps
they may be also in some degree assigned to the fact that
poor old Mother Earth is swindled shamefully by seed-
merchants:—
“Inferior German rapeseed (which has the º: of
English-grown turnipseed) is steamed, then kiln-dried, which
destroys its vitality, for the purpose of mixing with turnipseed
to the extent of about one *. of killed seed to three of
turnip-seed. The rape costs about 48s, per qr., and the turnip-
seed about £10 per qr.
“Again, inferior and old samples of clovers are dyed for the
ºl. of mixing with cloverseed of greater value, and trefoil
$: eap and inferior kind of clover) is also killed and dyed for
e purpose of adulterating red clover.”
If farmers sow bad seed º: must expect bad ;
and meat must rise in price when cattle-feed is cos {.
Farmers are ever ready to complain of their b uck,
and assign it to bad weather. They would, however, show
more sense, if they took care to sow good seed; but as
sense is not a quality for which they are remarkable, a
Bill has been promoted to atone for their deficiency. #y
this measure a smash will come, upon the seed-swindlers,
It is a burning shame that a kiln for drying seed should
be a kiln for kill’n it; and they who swindle Mother Earth
in the way we have described, ought to be hauled over the
coals and well scorched at the fire of public indignation.

FROUDE ON THE TWO RºS.
ON being installed Rector of St. Andrew's University, MR. FROUDE
the other day delivered an inaugural address which, as reported, shines
in vivid contrast to the prolix Buncombe commonly puffed by “able
editors” as eloquence, whereof...you read so many yards in the news:
}. under the head of Parliamentary Intelligence. The talented
resident of the Board of Trade, however, and some other persons,
how thoroughly soever, they may approve of part, will as entirely
dissent from the remainder, of the following passages in that remark-
able discourse :-
“We have had thirty years of unexampled clerical activity among us; the
churches have been §. #. books, magazines, and newspapers
have been poured out º hundreds of thousands, while by the side of it there
has .."; up an equa { astonishing development of moral dishonesty. From
the great houses of the City of London to the village grocer, the commercial
life of England has been saturated with fraud. So deeply has it gone that a
strictly honest tradesman can hardly hold his ground against competition.
You can no longer trust that any article you buy is the thing which it pre-
tends to be. We have false weights, false measures, cheating and shoddy
everywhere.”
The PRESIDENT of THE BoARD of TRADE, and the minor mercantile
gentlemen, of Southwark and Marylebone, are doubtless in perfect
accord with so many of the foregoing words as those which assert the
increase and allege the unfruitfulness of clerical activity and church-
extension. We may º: them ready to concur in the statement
that Fºl. thereunto there has arisen a proportional development of
moraſ dishonesty; that is to say, amongst part of the upper classes—
for instance, the horse-racing. But that the trading classes generally,
and in particular any class of shopkeepers, have grown in roguery, we
apprehend that the Minister of Commerce, and its cultivators north
and south of the Thames, will strenuously deny. “False weights,
false measures, and cheating, we have nowhere to speak of, MR.
FROUDE. Not a word about shoddy.” To all that comes next, bar-
ring the reference to shoddy and the like of that article, the Right
Honourable Gentleman, and his right honest clients, for the most part,
we dare say, cordially assent, and the wiser part of our clergy not to
say laity themselves, must lament that it is nearly all unquestionable:-
“Yet the clergy have seen all this grow up in absolute indifference; and
the great question which at this moment is actuating the Church of England
is the colour of the ecclesiastical petticoats. Many a hundred sermons have
I heard in England, many a dissertation on the mysteries of the faith, on the
divine mission of the clergy, on apostolical succession, and the theory of good
works, and verbal inspiration, and the efficacy of the sacraments; but never,
during these thirty wonderful years, never once that I can recollect on common
honesty, on those primitive commandments, Thou shalt not lie, and thou
shalt not steal.”
There may exist, some doubt whether, in all the time, that MR;
FRoude mentions, he never heard one single sermon against lying and
stealing; but, even if he has heard, and forgotten, one or two, they are
as the one or two ºl. or pears, the production of which, to disprove
the statement that the orchard they were found in contained no fruit,
was instanced as a donkey's argument by DR. Johnson. MR FROUDF
tells manifestly quite the truth in representing the Church of England
as at present chiefly occupied with millinery. So much is this the case
that one wonders that not one of the Ritualist publishers has got up
an illustrated ecclesiastical fashion-book, under the title of Le Fallet
Courrier des Églises. The art of printing in colours, tastefully applied,
would make it a safe speculation. - - --
There is an analogy, as well as a parallel, between the Ritualism and
the Roguery now and of late both rampant. Ritualism plays fast and
loose with the Thirty-Nine Articles. Roguery, as to an indefinite
number of other articles, tampers with weights and measures. Ritu-
alism adds various Romish stuff to Anglican linen. Roguery adul-
terates its cloth for sale with shoddy. In short, we may couple
Ritualism with Roguery as the two R's.

A CAPITAL ENTERTAINMENT.
THANKyou, MR. GERMAN REED-Punch thanks you very much for
a vastly pleasant evening. The “Entertainment” at your º Is
really entertaining, and that is more than can be said of many so-called
“entertainments.” You have done the Stage §§ service, too, by
introducing on it, an excellent new actor. Clearly his performance is
of more than usual promise. Not only he can act, but he can sing as
well; and, when these powers are combined, the warbler must be looked
on as a rara avis. In these days of vulgar music-halls, and vapid,
coarse burlesques, it is a treat to hear agentleman, who *H: a
ntleman, sing a comic song, which really is a comic one. This is
one now daily at the Gallery of Illustration: and Punch, remembering
an old service in a charitable cause, records with pleasure the success
of MR. ARTHURCECIL.
A Rock Ahead.
A TELEGRAM from Madrid has agitated our Foreign Office by the
portentous information that:-
“In to-day's sitting of the Cortes, SENoR.ORENSE gave notice of an
interpellation respecting the future of Gibraltar.”
That future some Spaniards would fain have us make a present of,
by presenting them with Gibraltar. As long as Gibraltar is necessary
to our maritime position, don't they wish they may get it?

CURIOUS ENTOMOLOGICAL STUDY
MADE FROM our STALL THE OTHER EVENING.
DRESSING AND DEWOTION.
WE wonder if fine ladies ever go to church to show off
their fine dresses. One would fancy that some must do so,
at any rate in Paris, else wherefore have some dressmakers
there put forth what they please to call a “programme for
the Holy Week,” whence it may interest fair readers if we
cite the following:—
“Toilette de Sermon. Robe de poult de soie noire; Metter-
nich de méme étoffe, garnie d'une ruche chicorée; chapeau
satin, mance Sultan, mélé de Chantilly, forme Maintenon;
bottines de chevreau Sultan; gants de Saxe; missel de chagrin
rouge; col et manches toile de Hollande ; cravate de Chan-
tilly; boutons d'or uni; chapelet d'or.”
A congregation, all arrayed in their toilettes de sermon
must be a most improving and most edifying sight. A
lady whose mind is quite at ease about her dress, who is
conscious that her boots are of the fashionable colour, and
that her, bonnet is constructed of the very very latest
fashionable shape, can of course devote her thoughts en-
tirely to devotion, and can listen to a sermon with undis-
turbed, attention, in serenity and º Where all are
dressed, alike, too, in the yery height of fashion, there can
be no disquietings of jealousy or envy, and no dread of
being criticised can rankle in the breast. We doubt, how-
ever, if a sermon be the better laid to heart for bein
listened to byears adorned with fashionable ear-rings; .#
heads which are so filled with the worship of the toilette,

CROWNER'S QUEST LYNCH LAW.
MR. PUNCH, -
AN assize jury has, of course, reversed the verdict of man-
slau º returned by a coroner's against the two breaksmen concerned
in the railway accident at Abergele. It acquitted the prisoners in
ten minutes. Sir, they have, however, by, no means escaped punish-
ment. If they didn’t #.". they went to fº and at any rate
they have been put to the cost, and subjected to the suspense and
anxiety, of having to be tried for felony. ---
Whenever any individual, still more when any numbers, of the British
Public are #. by accident, somebody must be punished. . Somebody
did or omitted to do something, and so caused the accident. But
common law does not make such act or omission necessarily criminal:
It admits the excuse of infirmity or error in judgment; will not call
homicide by misadventure mans º: ; will so call casual homicide
by carelessness only, or by culpable ignorance. So, by assize law
breaksmen, stokers, engineers, or other railway servants, having the
misfortune, without any fault, to occasion the death of any passengers,
would go unscathed. -
Here Crowner's questlaw supplies the defect of assize law, Mr. Punch.
Coroners' juries find verdicts of manslaughter irrespectively of fault.
Those verdicts, cannot be, sustained; but the prisoners found not
guilty have in the meanwhile been punished in the ways above-named,
inclusive recollect, perhaps of some months' imprisonment. British
Crowners' º law, you see, Sir, is, in its way supplementary to law
roper, much as Lynch law is in, the United States. Only, Lynch
}. cares for natural right as well as public safety—Crowner's quest
law contemplates public safety alone. - -
Your Consistency will see that law proper should be reconciled with
Crowners' quest law. It soon will. We are evidently on the verge
of a great legal reform. In conformity with a very extensive feeling,
occasionally asserted by some of our principal public instructors, acts
will in no long time come to be judged with respect to their operation
only, and without any º to their motives. “Hang homicidal
maniacs,” is the º: ich, more or less paraphrased in various
quarters, expresses this feeling-Society’s pure instinct of self-protec-
tion. Never mind the maniac, look simply at the homicide. y not
also cry, “Hang all breaksmen and others who break people's neck;
and occasion homicide, whether, by misfortune or by negligence P’
Only because it might be difficult to replace them, or to retain the un-
hanged in their situations.
There appears to be a growing conyiction that the end of punishment
is simply protective. On that principle, the law would punish a fatal
mistake, not at all for any supposed #. in it, but solely with a view
to make the offender, or, if it hang the offender, then to make other
people, more careful another time, You would hang a homicide, Sir,
just as you gibbet a scarecrow, in terrorem, and for nothing else; you
would whip a garotter precisely as you would a hound, to break him of
his practices, and discourage his like. In short, it is fast becomin
unfashionable to consider crimes, or any other actions, as to their mo
character at all. Such consideration is commonly stigmatised by our
strong-minded men as sentimental; and, certainly, morality and senti-
ment, in as far as sentiment is not immoral, are convertible terms.
Abolish sentiment—abolish º;
Fiat justitia rual calum f. Not for the future, Mr. Punch. If the
skies should fall, larks would be caught; but the British Public, and
every other Public, would be crushed, Sir. Fiat injustiția to any amount,
if necessary for the public safety. Hang everybody, justly or unjustly,
whose execution may be needful for that paramount purpose. }.
indeed, exactly, hang breaksmen, pointsmen, stokers, and engine:
drivers for accidental homicide; but spare their lives only because, if
you absolutely hung them, you would thereby incur the inconvenience
of a railway stand-still. There is also a reason for not making them in
every case of fatal railway accident legally punishable for manslaughter.
Such accidents sometimes occur from parsimonious arrangements, in
which cases the protection of the British Public would be the rather
consulted if the parties made criminally responsible were the Directors.
I am, Sir, the Supreme Law. You must sacrifice individuals to
SALUs PopULI.
Not a Doubt of it.
A writeR in the Times upon the “Criminal haunts” of London
assigns much of their vice to the demoralising influence of the numerous
low pawnbrokers. ..In fact, these criminal haunts would never, be so
full of crime, were it not for the abundance of the criminal “uncles.”
WHAT WILL IT TAKE?
GoLD has many properties, but we never knew that it could feel a
desire for drink, until playbills and posters told us of The Thirst of
Gold at the Olympic.

APRIL FOOLS.
CoME, April fools, from this side sea,
Come, April fish, from t'other—

For you’re a fool, and I’m a fool;
And in this nipping weather
The more the fools the merrier . . . .
So here’s all fools together
Which head were’t best that I invest
With Punch's Cap of Folly?
Who with its bells is like to make
Music most melancholy?
England has hosts of candidates,
And France, I see, has plenty:
One Arch-fool it is hard to choose
Though easy to choose twenty f
Say, should it be the Fenian,
That dab at vulgar fractions f
Whose scheme is to make Ireland one,
By letting loose her factions :
To feed her fat by damming out
The commerce of the Saxon;
And ease her load by leaving nought
The State can lay a tax on.
To raise to flood her tide of wealth
º drying up its fountain ;
And turn on John BULL, in the might
Of molehill against mountain.
To share the land : spin ropes of sand;
Fools' Heavens convert fools' Hells to :
Rise up, my Fenian April fool,
You’ve earned the cap, and bells, too !
And yet I wist my Ritualist’s
A. iº rival,
From bºbs and bows, and mops and mows,
Who looks for faith's revival;
Who in a cold, dark world finds light
And warmth, in altar-candles :
Holds rites and vestments helps to Heaven,
And prayers in plain clothes scandals.
Who shakes his head at LUTHER's name,
And sighs for “Papa noster;”
Meantime, from pulpits Protestant
Doth Papal doctrines foster :
Content by thumb of Priest and Church
To gauge Heaven's rule and Hell's, too—
He leaves the Fenian in the lurch—
Give him the cap, and bells, too!
But rampant rise to claim the prize
Competitors a couple;
An Orange-man with bloodshot eyes,
An Ultramontane supple.
For Protestant ascendenc
The one, for Papist t'other;
At odds in all, but the resolve
of each to damn his brother.
O'er GLADstone's Bill had they their will,
Kilkenny's cats they’d equal :
And fight till but two tails were left—
Two tales without a sequel !
But cooler England steps between,
As their wrath high-tide swells to ;
And since the crown she can't assign,
Diyides the cap, and bells, too.
“Now nay, now may !” LoRD John may say:
“Advance our feudal banners :
And raise a claim to cap and bells,
In morals' name and MANNERs'!
Right in the teeth of saucy facts,
I’ll make my docile flock run,
DAME PARTINGTON swept back the sea,
Back MANNERs bids the clock run!”
And here come Lords of Wested Rights
In Schools and Boards and Westries,
To prove that what’s wrong is our own,
What’s right, is our Ancêstry’s.
If they think long-befooled John BULL
Will longer yield their yells to,
I think their Lordships may put in
Good claim to cap, and bells, too.
But turn the sight to left or right,
The cry is still “They’re coming!”
Like flies about a honey-cask, .
Or wasps round peaches humming.
So dense the swarm of April fools,
Pure English, for the picking,
That foreign April fish can find
No room their tails for sticking.
'Tis clear one crown is not enough
Among so many claimants
So glorious in their length of ears,
And motleyness of raiments.
Keep England's cap for English fools,

“I much regret to say that, being engaged with my confirmations, it will
be quite impossible for me to be present to do honour to one of the greatest

Thus has the ARCHBishop of York confirmed the popular estimate

CANTABRIGIAN ONOPHAGY.
T, times it, has rained cats and
dogs lately; but the subjoined
extract from a newspaper sug-
gests the probability that those
poor animals are going to be
robbed of their meat:—
“GASTRONoMY IN CAMBRIDGE,
—At the instance of a prominent
Member of Trinity an ass has been
slaughtered, dressed, and prepared
for cooking. It is an animal about
nine years of age, and was for some
time subjected to light work, but
of late has been ‘living in clover'
on the farm of MR. LANGTON, at
Trumpington, in the vicinity of
Cambridge. It was duly fattened
up, then butchered and dressed by
º. Holden, a butcher, of Fitzroy
Street, Cambridge.”
The mere information that an
Ass at Cambridge had been
slaughtered, dressed, and pre-
pared for ºf would of
itself alone look frightfully
anthropophagous, since it does
- not assure us that the Cam.
bridge Ass, killed and prepared for cooking, was not an Under-
graduate, or even a Don; for Dons have been, and may still be, some
of them, Donkeys. But our minds are relieved by the statement that
this Ass was only about nine years old. Men, do not come up to the
University so early as nine. We perceive, therefore, that the victim
Was a re quadruped with long ears, and not a man, called, or
written down, an Ass because of inability, for instance, to pass his
little-go. There are still, however, many ºple who, when they con-
sider that “a prominent member of Trinity” has eaten “moke,” when,
if he had chosen, he might have dined on mutton, will say that the
word prefixed to the above-quoted paragraph, should have been, not
‘Gastronomy,” but “Cannibalism.”

WHAT a wonderful calorific is enthusiasm At the Wolunteer

ordinary March weather, stand out a Review, even if paid the larger
of those two sums to do so, unless he were very hard up indeed P But
philosophers are cold-blooded, and their blood is not to be warmed
except with some such stimulant as wine or spirituous liquor. A more
enerous º brandy, rum, gin, or whiskey, firing the British
ublic, enables it, surveying the evolutions of its patriotic protectors,
to resist, for hours, the operation of a very low temperature, and pay
very high prices for the privilege of an altitude in the cold.

it not be well for all, both Masters and Men, to be “minders” of the

TÉTE DE WEAU EN TORTUE.
Of all laws sumptuary laws are about the most odious.
Of all sumptuary laws the most odious law that can be
imagined would be a law forbidding the consumption of
real turtle. But what would aggravate the odiousness of
that law to the highest possible degree would be a state
of things which, disallowing the consumption of real
turtle, permitted that of mock. -
The Rev. MR, Low DER, on Good Friday last, with a tail
of Ritualists at his back, is said to have erambulated St.
George's-in-the-East, as the Coryphaeus of a mimic Roman
Catholic procession, .

Suppose, ARCHBIshop, MANNING and a train of Popish
priests had made, in public, the original demonstration of
which Parson Iowper's was a copy, would they not have
committed an illegal act? Would not the Police have been
empowered to compel them to move on, off, and away; and
in case of their refusal, to conduct them to the station-
house? As a fact, we see no Roman Catholic processions
in the thoroughfares, but only shams, of them, and what
is there to prevent the realities but the law?
If Parson Lowder can, and ARCHBishop MANNING
cannot, march the streets at the head of an ecclesiastical
posse, that condition of non possumus, as MANNING might
say, is very unfair to the Papists. The law is a WHALLEY
still, and cries “No, Popery 1”. Religious equality is not
yet; persecution still vexesour Roman Catholic brethren—
we had almost said fellow-subjects; but as for us, our alle-

SALMON.—MR. DACE—MR. PORPOISE—MR SALMON AND His MAN, dis
WOODPECKER—MEASUREMENT—THE GAS QUESTION-ARRIVAL OF
THE PROPRIETOR.
THE rehearsals of KING FyscHER's operetta for the private thea-
tricals at the MACAws (of Macaw) party afforded a yery pleasant way
of spending the spare hours between four o'clock and dinner-time, and
so various evenings when there was no other engagement.
NIPPER was, I recollect, the man whose time it was difficult to suit,
as he was out every *** and would only promise to “look in', after
one of his parties, on his road home; which promise, being made con-
ditionally, was rarely kept., To the rehearsals in the afternoon he was
as punctual as a sentry at the Horse Guards, seeing that being engaged
in an office (as assistant-secretary's assistant clerk, a very gentlemanly
appointment of some considerable value) he was very strict in observing
to a minute the hour when business finished. This was four o'clock,
and at half-past NIPPER was at MRs. MACAw’s.
The difficulty was to get every one to time. One day we were all
there but KING FYscHER, who came, full of apologies, just five minutes
before everyone had to go away. Another time it would be Air Foong.
who thought we were going to rehearse the operetta and without the
farce (he only playing in the latter), and would in the evening (when
the operetta was rehearsed, and not the farce) overwhelm us all with
his sorrow for the “inconvenience which he feared he really must have
caused,” &c., &c. -
ToM PORGUPINF having been lugged in, on account of his knowing
something about the stage and stage matters (he could, it was averred,
shake hands with, three managers, calling, them by their surnames,
without prefix, and had had one farce refused by five principal theatres,
and one produced somewhere at some time or other), was made much of
when he came, and pleaded most important business, in a literary way,
as an excuse for nonattendance generally.
&c.
“If they want us to go and rehearse,” said ToM, crustily, why
don’t they ask us to dinner P Rehearsal first, dinner afterwards.”
And this, being a good idea, was suggested to MRs. MACAw, who not
ººmy invitations at present, had several evenings at her own
p0s
“Oh, MR. PorcupiNE,” says she, one night, “what shall we do
about the stage P”
“Better hire one,” suggests ToM.
NIPPER, who must be worth a fortune to theatrical costumiers and
perruquiers, immediately puts in, “Go to SALMON.—can’t do better
than SALMon.” - -
ALF PooDEL objects. “Go to DACE,” says he, mentioning another
eminent purveyor of costumes theatrical. -
“Not for a stage,” says NIPPER, speaking as an authority.
don’t put up stages.”
“Ah, well,” returns PooDEL, yielding this point; “but I always go
to DACE for dresses.”

"Oh, isn't he?” replies PooDEL, sarcastically. -
There is a great difference of opinion on this important subject
between these two. authorities, and well might SALMoN and DAge

mentioned. -

diately conveys the idea of a predominance of hair-oil in his toilette
(having apparently washed his hands and face in it by mistake), arrives
with his man (a sulky and silent person, very dirty, with a carpenter's
rule in his pocket), and is at once shown up-stairs by the servant, who
holds him at first in no small awe, as having some mysterious connec-
tion with the “Theayter.” MR. SALMoN enters the drawing-room
in an easy and affable style peculiar to himself, and, if neither NIPPER,
PooDEI, nor Porcupine are there, at once assumes the command,
and rules with the powerful confidence of one “who knows exactly
what you want, Ma'am.”
Strangely enough he seems to hit upon the scenes in KING FYSCHER's
operetta, not to mention the dresses and characters, as if he’d been
familiar with them from his childhood upwards.
“PeckºR,” says he to his man, who shelters himself bashfully in the
shadow of his chief, and slouches out with a two-foot rule, “just
measure this here.”. Then to MRs. MACAw, in rather a thick, dusty
voice, “I know exactly what, you want. Interior of ºut, fust act: set.
An nin, second, with table, chairs, and ushull properties.”
“Yes, quite so,” says MRs. MACAw, vaguely.
“Twenty-five by thirty,” growls PEcker, pocketing his rule, and
retiring once more into the shade.
“Very good,” continues SALMoN, as if he now saw it all at a glance.
“’Ut first; Inn second. You'll wish us to find everythink?”
MRs. MACAw replies rather faintly (being a little overcome by the
prevalence of the hair-oil), “Oh yes, if you please,” and rejoices to
think that further particularising is not expected of her.
MESSRs. SALMon and PEcker are just taking their leave when enter
NIPPER and PooDEL, followed by PorcupiNE.
In a second MR; SALMoN descends (as it were) from his throne of
conscious superiority over MRs. MACAw’s ignorance of theatricals, and
is ready to listen to what MR. NIPPER has to say.
NIPPER is exacting. He knows all SALMoN's scenes, and insists (on
pain of losing his custom for ever) on SALMoN not giving them that
old make-shift of an Inn which he sent to MRs. SANDFIPER's the other
evening. SALMQN promises; in fact will have “a new scene, pran new,
fresh a purpose for this operetta; and is there hanythink else?” It
appears that there are several anythinks elses, and MR. SALMON spends
his next hour under sharp examination from NIPPER and Porcupine as
to the scenes, the dresses, and the lights.
“We must have a front scene of a wood,” says NIPPER.
“We’ll paint you one,” answers MR. SALMON, readily. - -
“And mind it works well, and that we have it for rehearsal,” insists
NIPPER.
“It shall be here,” replies, SAIMON, “and the
and doors, and the wings and borders, all complete.
makes this summary, he moves towards the door.
A fearful thought suddenly strikes MRs. MACAw. “Oh!” says she,
“you won't knock the walls about very much, will you?”
MR. SALMoN immediately professes an instinctive reverence for the
; of property, and an intense regard for the preservation of walls,
folding-doors, and hanging-pictures. “There shan't be a nail any-
where,” says he, in a most conciliatory tone, “except, perhaps, just a
tack or two where it won't be seen, and is habsolute y necessary. MR.
NIPPER knows me.”
NIPPER, not altogether, displeased, by this appeal, corroborates
SALMon’s statement; and MRs. MAGAw's mind being set at rest on the
subject of the walls not being knocked about, is *...* to see MR.
SALMON detained º longer, when ALF PooDEL (who doesn't think
much of SALMoN and his arrangements) suddenly exclaims, -
“Yes, that’s all very well for the scenes; but how are you going to

* Foot-lights,” says Tom PorcupiNE, as if nothing was easier.
“Ah! but where?” says PooDEL, putting this as a poser. , .
“On the ground,” answers NIPPER, “of course; ” while MR.

arious as its own.

ascend by the vertebral tissues into the brain, and select the cells in which
they develop the perceptions of sense and the faculties of mind. The spheres
of their productive energy, expanding by action, raise the overlying portions
of the cranium beneath which they work. This is the only rational view
which can be taken of phrenology, and may serve to account for the cases by
which its advocates maintain that their opinions are confirmed.”
. Let us try and construe so much of the foregoing extract as we need
in order to be enabled to see precisely how profound is its meaning.
. Varieties of properties of spirit are conveyed by different agencies
into the human frame to perform their vital functions. Whose vital
functions?. The vital functions of the different agencies, or the vital
functions of the varieties of properties of spirit themselves—their own
vital properties?... Not the vital functions of the human frame; our
philosopher says “their,” not “its.” We have accordingly to form to
ourselves distinct ideas of the vital functions of an agency, and also of
its co-
the vital functions of a property, both, if we can; if we cannot, then, if
possible, clearly to conceive the vital functions of either a property or
an agency. Having made sense of both, or either, we shall have little
difficulty in making further sense of the vital functions of different
agencies, and of the vital functions of varieties of properties, or else of
the vital functions of the former or the latter, as the case may be. We
may, however, consider, without much fear of being mistaken, that
these several vital functions are on the whole pretty much alike and
equally intelligible. - - - -
The next proposition which we have to master is, that varieties of
roperties of spirit, conveyed by different agencies into the human
rame, ascend by the vertebral tissues into the brain. Of course the
author of this statement knows that the vertebral tissues are the com-
onent parts of the vertebrae or bones which united constitute the

the properties of º: climb up into the brain by this ladder. (Do they

sherris sack,” that it “ascends me into the brain; . . ; makes it appre:
hensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes.”
Our antiphrenological reviewer's varieties of spirit behave in some
measure like sack. They ascend me into the brain; but then they do
me more than filling it with the shapes which Falstaff mentions. They
select the cells in which they develop the perceptions of sense and the
faculties of mind. What an astonishing selection is this, made by
varieties of properties of spirit! But that is not all. The spheres of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HINTS FOR CONVERSATION.
RE there such creatures as shy young
men still to be found by enterprising
naturalists? Perhaps the species is
not wholly extinct; here and there
a specimen may be discovered in
country towns where they have one
ublic ball, for the benefit of the
ispe , and three private dances
to amuse them in the winter months,
the assembling of the Yeomanry once
in three years, in May, and an an-
nual pleasure fair and water-party
as summer entertainments. Do we
address any, who are diffident, but
barely provided with conversation
in their intercourse with the diviner
sex, particularly with the younger
angels, grouping on gala occasions
with other youth in corners and
doorways, and not emitting a bril-
liant light in dining- and drawing-
room *
There is hope for such as these,
there is something better than the
“conversational sofa.” mentioned a
se’mnight or two back—there is a
professor, rather a professoress, of
the talking art who removes shy-
- ness, extracts diffidence, and com-
pletely eradicates all nervous awkwardness. But they will have to
go to America to be cured—to thriving Chicago, where, according to
the Morning. Star, a young woman advertises that she will “give
lessons in etiquette, and the way of conversing with ladies, to any
young gentleman who does not feel at ease in the society of the oppo.
site sex. Tuition to lovers, extra.” If the “young woman,” who is
reported to have been “quite successful,” wi come over to England
after she has finished her lessons in America, she will be welcomed
almost as heartily as MR. Lothrop Motley, have an immense class
of pupils, and go back to Chicago, there to * a happy old age in
the possession of a handsome competence and first-rate testimonials.
But is not the interference with lovers of doubtful
if the young woman is good looking, or,
º riety, especially
to use the
- - - *; of the
placarding papers, “of a highly prepossessing exterior.” e leave |-
this to Congress.
As MR. otley, the successor to MR. REVERDy Jon Nson, who
deserves our kindest farewells, is likely to be a good deal talked about,
it may be as well that you should know something of his picturesqué
Dutch Histories.(WILLIAM the “Silent” will at last be dragged into
conversation)—if only of the title-pages; and having correspondents in
New York, and Boston, it will not be strange if you express a wish
. this distinguished man of letters may help on cheap ocean
postage.
Further, mindful of your º promise to MARIAN WINTHORPE
when she went to stay with her aunt at Clayworth—a village purely
agricultural, and not possessing many objects of interest—to send her
two or three numbers of The Echo at a time, you are sure to stand up
(and sometimes sit down) in Society, for cheaper book-postage at home;
which subject, or one akin to it, appears to have attracted attention in
other places besides the House of 8. one of the learned Societies
having been º: with a paper on “an Envelope in the Cubic
Çorrespondence of Points.”. (Another paper ºf entitled “The
Invariants of a Pair of Conics,” we are ây looking out for an
annºuncement in the Times that among the latest additions to the
Zoological Gardens are “a Pair of Conics,” presented by the Nawab
of Nagpore.)
Talk as you please on the question of Life Peerages (here’s a health
to LoRDs LAwkENCE and PENZANc6), for you are not very likely to
arouse angry passions on that topic; but be cautious what you say on
the subject of opening Public Museums and Galleries on Sundays.
(Were you not sorry for MR. BRUCE when you read that in one day he
“received three deputations, and had to listen to no fewer than twenty-
five speeches on the Sunday Question?” He ought to have his
salary substantially raised if he has to go through such sufferings as
these frequently.) Not because you have any doubt that they ought
to be opened, and that they will §: opened, but because it is always
desirable, when you are enjoying exquisite savours, and flavours, and
vintages, and the company of fair women, to avoid anything like argu-
ment or dispute; and as there might be some one present engaged in
the liquor trade, or largely interested in publichouse property, or a
believer in the fitness of allowing no recreation on Sunda , except
what may be derived from successive quarterms of highly so {i,j
gin, do not, at all events, rouse the subject. But if you find that your
neighbour thinks as you do, ask him if it is not surprising that those

of monotonous wearying toil from Monday morning to Saturday might

THE APATHETIC EGYPTIANS.
THE PRINCE OF WALEs must have been amused when, the other day, his Royal Highness
went in state from the new Palace at Cairo to the old, thereat to honour with his presence
the levée of Ismail PASHA. Thus writes the Special Correspondent of the Times:–
“There was a considerable crowd outside the Palace railings as the Prince's carriage, preceded by out-
riders in scarlet and gold, and by mounted cavasses in full uniform, slowly passed out into the street to
the sound of the Royal sai
ute, and there were hats and caps raised, and a few Cheers were heard; but the
Oriental is not in the aggregate easily moved,
and, least of all, by an infidel show ; and although
there were graceful salutations by upraised hands,
and the most respectful attitude on the part of
the multitude, drawn up as if by order on both
sides of the tortuous streets, not a sign of admi-
ration at the fine sight, or of any emotion at the
aspect of the unusual uniforms, could be detected
on their faces.”
The contrast between this unmoved gr
vity on the part of the Egyptian Public,
with the demonstrative enthusiasm towards
illustrious personages in procession usually
manifested º: the British, no doubt afforded
diversion to Her Majesty's Heir Apparent.
Heartiness is one of the many high qualities
in which the sight-seeing multitude of Eng-
land excels every other people in the whole
world, perhaps not even except the American,
The “graceful salutations by upraised
hands” witnessed by DR., Russeli, “as
our Prince's carriage, preceded by outriders
in scarlet and gold, and by mounted cavasses
in full uniform, slowly passed out into the
street,” were doubtless the expressions of
Oriental reverence, but as little can it be
questioned that those other hands by which
“there were hats and caps raised” pertained
to sojourners in the land of Egypt, natives
of another land, countrymen, indeed, of the
PRINCE, OF, WALEs, and individuals of
exactly the like class with those who com-
monly figure, performing the like acts, in
the woodcuts representative of similar occa-
sions in the Illustrated London News. Those
of the spectators from whom “a few cheers
were heard” were of course the same
persons, or at least belonged to the same
magnanimous nation.
Let cold-blooded aristocrats eulogise the
stolid apathy of Oriental dullards, and call it,
if they will, dignified courtesy; but Britons
will continue to flourish their hats and caps
in testimony to the pageant which excites
their ardent and irrepressible admiration, to
hail its exalted yet condescending hero with
successive cheers, and respond to his frequent
*::: right and left with shouts of
“Bravo!
DON'T FORGET THE PARCEL.
MR. JoHN LOTHROP MoTLEY, the delight-
ful historian, is likely, we are told, to come
here as the new representative of the United
States. He will be welcome — he is well
remembered—in fact, we do “wear Motley
in our Brain.” But Mr. Punch hopes that
something in the shape of an English tribute
will be offered to that kindly hearted gen-
tleman, MR. REVERDY Johnson, before he is
allowed to º: He has been assiduously
doing his best to create the international
sympathy which we desire to believe exists,
and if ever a man came under the provi-
sions of the beatitude about peace-makers,
MR. JoHNson is the man. “Welcome the
coming, speed , the parting guest.” is, an
admirable social rule, but there will be less

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 5, There be divers Formosas, or Formosa, including
the winner of the last Oaks. One of them is an island in Chinese
waters, where the people don't seem to like Presbyterians, and where
this singular repugnance was recently illustrated by an attack upon
some native converts to Johnknoxism. To correct this weakness on
the part of the islanders, “the inevitable English gunboat” came up
and LIEUTENANT GURDON, her commander, in the most gallant and
skilful manner attacked a Chinese fort, slew some dozen of the bigoted
Formosans, and made the authorities pay the expenses of their chastise-
ment... But as we have arranged with China that she is to be treated
like other civilised nations (a gracious concession, as she had colleges,
institutions, and all sorts of refinements, while our own respected an-
cestors wore nothing but woad), we have apologised, removed the
Vice-Consul who called up the secular power, and sent the money back.
The difficulty is laid to the Missionaries, whom we shall certainly have
to ticket and license, one of these days. LoRD SHAFTESBURY, hoped
that they would take the excellent advice that had been given them to
be particularly careful. Where is that Cassowary P China is not
Timbuctoo, we know, but the moral’s the same.
The Commons partially discussed the Bankruptcy Bill, and MR.
JESSEL delivered an elaborate speech thereon. As nobody who care-
fully reads Punch, and acts up to his teaching, can ever be in any
difficulties, pecuniary or otherwise, the topic may soon be dismissed
here. The general object of the Bill is to let the creditors settle
matters with the bankrupt, by which plan they will get at a lot of his
property, if he has any, instead of a very little, as now. We also dis-
cussed the Bill for the Abolition of Imprisonment for Debt. The only
point º: at issue is whether the County Courts should be able to
do with the small debtor what no Courts, except in strong cases of
fraud, are to do with the big one. The usual phrase about one law for
the rich and another for the poor, was of course brought into play, but
it is urged in answer that the poor must have credit, and that the
tradesman will not give it unless he has a hold on the person of him
who # usually without property, and of whom the Scotch humanely
remark-
“If he have not gold to fine,
He has shins to pine.”
Apropos whereof, Punch would much like to make the Tally-man's debt
irrecoverable. This fellow goes, in the husband's absence, and tempts
the wife into extravagance, by the , offer of credit, and quarrels and
misery are the result. Husbands should cry “tally ho!” when they
see him skulking off, and set any dogs on him that may be at hand;
and if there is nothing with four legs ready, a three-legged stool may
be dispatched with the happiest result.
Tuesday. The Lords polished off the Habitual Criminals Bill. There
is no mistake about this bold and salutary measure. It carries the
war into the enemy's country, and wages it by no means as the DUKE
used to wage war, or as if it were a Civil War. There will be small
choice for rascaldom. Honesty, or emigration, are the alternatives, if
the law be worked vigorously. The great lawyers see the necessity for
it, and it is to be hoped that the Commons º not listen to the small
lawyers, and other small folks who will make a clamour about the un-
#. practice of asking a scoundrel, with a mask and jimmy, what
he happens to mean by being near your door at midnight.
CAPTAIN ARCHDALL is, and has been for thirty years, the Conserva-
tive Member for Fermanagh, which is in Ireland. He gave notice that
on the third reading of the Irish Church Bill, he should move that its
rovisions extend to the Church of England and the Kirk of Scotland.
"irst, says the Conservative Standard, there were cheers, then there
was laughter, and lastly, there was a kind of puzzled silence. The
puzzle we are not careful to put together, but there be various sorts of
silence, and that which succeeds laughter is not of the kind most to be
coveted by a speaker. - -
MR. GRAves, Conservative Member for Liverpool, introduced, in an
able speech, an important question. Why do we pay the English post-
office so much for carrying newspapers and other printed matter, when
on the Continent and in America people pay so little *. It is cheaper,
said MR. MUNDELLA, to post a circular in Palermo, in Sicily, for Aber-

deen, in Scotland, than to post it in the Strand for the House of Com:
mons. Companies can deliver, for Eight and Ninepence, a thousand
circulars, for delivering which the MARQUIs of HARTINGTON, charges
£4. 3s. 4d. Of course, figures do not prove .."; and the speed
and certainty of our own system are most valuable. The official answer
is Revenue. This, however, was the answer when SIR. Row1AND
HILL's penny postage scheme was started. Another answer is that
Letters are the first consideration, and that they could not be delivered
as rapidly as at presentif printed matter came in avalanches. But this
is a detail, and will not do for Mr. Punch. The idea of there being
an difficulty, of a mechanical sort, in these days, is preposterous.
ºil. on this topic, why are Letters much more heavily taxed than
print? It costs as much to send an envelope, inscribed “All right,”
as to send ten closely printed pages of a daily paper. With the º
in view, of course there was no chance of immediate success for MR
GRAves, and the Previous Question was moved. Then MR. GLAD-
stone, knowing that, there were numbers of new Members, present,
obligingly rose and delivered a little lecture explanatory of this form.
He apprised the nqvices that the vote for the º only
meant to signify that this was not the moment to settle the matter.
MR. GRAVEs was resolute, and took the divisiºn, º ing 62 against
229. We shall hear a good deal more on this subject. -
Then the House minded—or mound (if you want a new verb)-its
own business—that is, its own want of accommodation for its Mem-
bºrs."We never intrude in º do not concern us, but mention
that Mr. Headlam º that one of the great charms of the House
was the graceful social relations between its Members, whose friend-
ships were not likely to be promoted by fights for seats; that LoRD
Eicho found a pair ºf dogskin gloves in his usual place, which articles
being put there against prayer-time, he d Devotional Dogskin;
and that MR. Gladstone was calmly cynical, and in replying to the
argument that new Members would º 'large numbers, observed
that the same thing was said at the time o *i; first Reform Bill, but
the attendance soon dropped off. . -
A Select Committee, was appointed on the Enclosure of Wisley
Common. Mr. Punch detests the enclosure of Commons, and is more.
over informed, on good authority, that this business is a device to shut
out the public from one of the prettiest and wildest places within
twenty miles of London. The Members most nearly interested in the
matter never opened their lips in the debate. Mr. Punch regrets to
add that they are all Liberals. If the Wisley Enclosure can be de-
º will have spoken Wisly, but not too well-only exactly well
enough.
Wednesday. Nothing of interest, except the able maiden speech of
MR. KAvANAGH, a gentleman, whose victory over physical malforma-
tion is one of the most remarkable triumphs of will.
Thursday. Poor LoRD REDEspale continues to be haunted by the
Coronation Oath, and gave notice that he meant to ask whether
Government intended to have it altered. It is odd that so shrewd a
man of business—a man whose eye darts through and through the
most elaborate swindles of railway folks—should be so dull in this
simple matter. We incline to appeal to his pride. Qught not a

Tax, one of the two pennies which were laid on by KING THEopone.
Also, he abolishes the shilling duty on Foreign Corn, and the Poor

He modifies the taxes on Locomotion, and specially makes so huge a
reduction of the duty on Cabs, that a bad cab ought never to be seen
again.

in honour of Temperance.

The Assessed Taxes are at present collected in a clumsy manner,
and by instalments. Henceforth they are to be in the nature of Excise
Licences, and are to be collected by trained and disciplined Govern-
ment officers, whº will exact them to the last farthing. Moreover,
they are all to be levied in January, in a lump, and we are to pay them
all at once. MR. Lowe says that the poor hate being often bothered
for taxes, and the rich like to pay once and have done with it. But
how about, those who are neither very one nor very tºother, and how
will they like being called on for a year's taxes in alump :
By this means, and with the aid of 3. CARDw ELL and CHILDERs'
“heroic” savings in Army and Navy, Abyssinia and all is set straight,
and we shall have a surplus of £442,000. MR. BobbLo's tour de force
is brilliant. So was not his speech, but he gave us two characteristic
bits, onein which he condoled with his predecessor because the rightsort
of old people didn’t die, to increase the succession duties, though use-
less old folks were falling right and left; and the other in reply to a
question. He said that if a man married in April, and his matrimonial
speculation was unfortunate, and he hanged himself on or before the
29th of December, he would not be asked to pay taxes. The quaint
Budget, quaintly expounded, was received with favour.

The Commons passed the Bill for protecting the poor dear Sea Birds.

of their right to murder the creatures, were kicked down-stairs.
MR. FAwcett, again persisting in taking a division, against the
advice of his leaders, got a signal defeat recorded for the Competitive
System. There was nothing else of much co uence, except that
MR. Hunt managed to irritate the PREMIER ; much warmth and
vehemence,” and to elicit from him the decl n, that he was still
desirous to tax Charities. MR. Disraeli was, of course, deprecatory-
a plain business question should not be answered with a torrent of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
z-
A TABLET AND A TOKEN.
Pall Mall Gazette, as an illustration of
“provincial flunkeyism,” thus refers to
2 an affecting example of humility:—
-
“The Wiltshire papers give us a full
account of the proceedings at ‘a grand
concert by a Choral Society at Wilton,
where MR. Gladstone has been on a visit
to LADY HERBERT of LEA, into whose
gentle keeping the adjoining domain,
together with the allegiance of the towns-
men, has fallen for the present. The local
incense expended on this occasion was
overpowering. The Rev. D. OLLIVIER
declared that it was a very memorable
occasion, for they had been honoured
with the presence of the PREMIER of
this great country; and he thought a
portion of the school fund might be use
to place a brass-plate where MR. GLAD-
sTone had that evening sat.’”
It may be expedient to correct a possible misapprehension of one of
the preceding statements:—“The local incense expended on this
occasion was overpowering.” Consideration of the fact that the
PREMIER's late hostess is the widow of one of MR. GLADstone's old
theological and Pºiº associates, and one of those fashionable ladies
who have passed from High Anglicanism into the Romish persuasion,
to which her Ladyship is one of the most zealous converts, might make
some stupid people imagine that the “local incense expended" on the
occasion of his presence actually consisted of sacrificial perfumes
exhaled by fire in flºº. of a Minister asserted by wild Protes-
tants to be swayed by Romanists’ influence. Let them know, then,
that incense, in the foregoing connection, means no more than what
butter and soap mean in the mouths or the manuscript of low persons.
The Rev. DR. OLLIVIER, we may be quite sure, would never think of
censing persons or things uncanonically; would certainly under no
circumstances, cense a layman, like MR. GLADSTONE. But his notion
of fixing a plate of brass to do honour unto the Prime Minister's place
was, perhaps a little excess of that natural lowliness which a priest
º exercise, with a will, in saluting his ecclesiastical sovereign's
€.
HABITUAL CRIMINALITY.
THE following º: of lº * in the police
reports of the same day with the debate on the Habitual Criminals Bill.
Readers may think that some little extra remedy for certain social evils
is wanted:—
“SERGEANT DowdELL, 12 F, said the prisoner kept a house which was let
out in lodgings to expert and well-known thieves, and she assisted them in
carrying off and disposing of the stolen property. One of her sons was a ticket-
of-leave man, and two of her daughters were convicted in this court, and
sentenced each to eighteen months' imprisonment, with two other persons, who
were respectively sentenced to seven and ten years' penal servitude for rob-
beries from the person. Witness and SERGEANT ACKRELL had also had two
º convicted to penal servitude from this house, and the prisoner was
own to be one of the worst receivers in London. She ostensibly kept a bird
shop, but it was nothing but a blind for the reception of stolen property.”
All the lessons which law sought to impress by the above treatment
of the interesting family were lost upon the prisoner, and she waxed
over-bold and came to grief. When we get the new Bill, we hope to
see her lodgers, the “expert and well-known thieves,” and some of
ºntº in similar trouble. Meantime the amiable bird-seller is a
gaOl-Dlrd.
A Cornish Lord.
THE Judge in Divorce is j. deservedly raised to the Peerage. SIR
JAMES WILDE takes a Cornish title, and is LoRD PENZANCE. We
might think that, considering his Lordship's special avocation, another
Cornish title, Lord St. Keyne of the § might have been as appro-
priate; But that is his business. He arrives in the House of Lords in
capital time, just as that tribunal has to take a most important Divorce
case, “ State v. Establishment, (falsely called Lady Church of Ireland)
and others,” and we believe that he has a strong opinion that the
petitioner has a good case, on the ground of incompatibility.
HINT FOR A HOLIDAY.

“CHANGE FOR A SOWEREIGN l’”
(An Old Fogey's Lament.)
Good Gracious ! what terrible times I’ve lived into
Revolution seems knocking at everyone's door!
Each day brings its call some new faith to give in to,
Each day makes its business some old one to floor.
Not a pillar of trust I once clung to, but’s broken:
Not a key-stone of faith but they’d loose in my creed :
My watch-words as texts for coarse mock’ry are taken,
And my beacons called will-of-the-wisps, to mislead.
I was born a True Blue, I was brought up a Tory;
Trained to hate Papists, sans-culottes, Lev’llers, and Rads:
To drink. “Church and State,” and think PITT England's glory;
To believe Frenchmen fools, and lump Lib’rals with cads.
I’ve lived to see Tories bring in Household Suffrage,
And, with DERby for guide, in the dark take a leap;
When the mob Hyde Park railings tore down in their rough rage,
Horse or §º: not : I saw WALPoLE weep.
I’ve known Wested Rights—aye of old Corporations—
Walked a-top of not only by FoRSTER and Lowe
I’ve seen bureaucratic French Centralisation's
Rude hand at Self-government’s ark deal its blow.
That “whate'er is, is right,” ancient wisdom would tell us:
That “whate'er is, is wrong,” now for wisdom is known:
And things they caiſ & rights of the million,” compel us,
To say, men mayn’t do what they like with their own |
An Englishman's house, of old time, was his castle,
Now that house by Inspectors and Boards is controlled,
Till John BUIL that was once Lord of Law, as Law's vassal,
Finds e'en his own homestead no longer his hold!
Once we stuck to old ways, howe'er slushy or skew ones:
But now the old ways we must curb, drain, and mend;
And be thankful if old aren't abandoned for new ones,
As taking, forsooth, shorter cuts to their end
"Twixt the rogue and the rope we once planted as buffer,
A maxim of that “perfect wisdom,” our law—
“Better ten guilty 'scape, than one innocent suffer;”
But new-light State doctors “ont changé tout celá.”
If a poor wretch, of theft twice convicted, should blunder
Into backyard or area, his purpose we doubt;
And harshly inferring he’s come there for plunder,
A meddling police force his ears bring about !
Once ’twas said of a fellow whose name had a handle,
He was born with a silver-gilt spoon in his mouth;
But now to promote one's relation's a scandal—
Younger sons, who won’t work, must face hunger and drouth!
Examiners' barriers, at backstairs are planted,
And family tickets won't pass people through; . .
Though 'tis high birth that wants, or low berth that is wanted,
There’s but one road—the cram-road—for snobs and for you !
Time was, when in Ireland the Protestant pastor,
Čould flourish his crook in the Romanisł's face,
And the hatred of creed proclaimed which Church was master,
More plainly than even the hatred of race:
Now GLADstone, of Church and State once the defender, , .
And Champion à l'outrance, through thick and through thin,
Of Irish-Church income proclaims the State spender, ..
And 'mong Papists and madmen shares Protestant tin'
In short, life’s a series of painful surprises,
And Society clean topsy-turvey is whirled:
Why call in John BRIGHT to Americanise us,
hen Tories turn traitors, to new-make the world?
Why seek the Antipodes? Only stay quiet—
As the drunken man did, while the houses swam round-
And we’ll find ourselves set, thanks to change's mad riot,
With our heels to the sky, and our heads to the ground!
AN AGREEABLE SURPRISE.-Mr. Low E will go down to posterity
as the author of a Surprise Budget. He may be said to have sur-
prised everybody by Lowe-ring taxation.

Street Boy (bursting with ecstasy). “You R TRowsies is A-comin' UNSEwBD, SIR 1"
LATEST NEWS OF A YOUNG NOBLEMAN.
A good many inquiries have recently been made as to the
whereabouts of an estimable young nobleman, named
Epward HENRY LoRD STANLEY, born 1826, who has
filled several important State offices, and did not speak in
the Irish Church debate, but gave a silent vote against the
Bill. For the information .# all who are anxious about
him, or who have advertised that if he will, apply...at
Downing Street he shall be treated as one of the family,
we reprint an official intimation which has appeared in the
Conservative organ, the Standard:—
“We will allow that it is a great public misfortune that Lord
CLARENDoN, instead of Lord STANLEY, should hold the seals
of the Foreign Office. We confess that the noble Lord might
command his own terms from the present Government, and
might have done the same at any tume during the last ten years.
Yet, notwithstanding all this, * * * * It is perfectly true
that existing combinations cannot last for ever. No combina-
tion could be more unnatural and more precarious than that
which leagues together the members of a Ministry like the
resent; which unites Papists and Presbyterians, Dissenters and
nfidels, Ritualists and Secularists, by the sole bond of a common
animosity; which seats MR. BRight and MR. Lowe on the
same bench, and induces the chiefs of the great territorial fami-
lies of Whiggery to serve side by side with men who avow semi-
socialist doctrines, in respect to landed property, and are
shrewdly suspected of thinking much more in that direction
than they yet care to avow.”
We do not quite understand how LoRD STANLEY could
have §ºl. his own terms from “the present.”
Government at any time during the last ten years, because
the present Government came into office only in last
December. But this may be a lapsus pennae, and the
Standard, may mean “any Government.” The important
part of the announcement is that Lord STANLEY believes
that the present Government cannot last, and that he is
ready to take office under MR. GLADstoNE’s successor.
Very well, but we think he may have to wait—and he can
afford to do so, having, as we have said, been born in 1826.
Good Conduct.
SIR,--I don't know what time Magistrates get up. But
am no early riser, and yet I was up before a Magistrate
twice last week. Šomething wrong here.
Yours, WINKER.
THE ART-HOUSE AND THE ALE-IIOUSE.
DEAR LoRD SHAFTESBURY,
Which is the better place wherein to spend a Sunday after-
noon—the South Kensington Museum or the bar-room of a beer-shop?
You will agree with me, I think, in favour of South Kensington;
and yet I find your Lordship heading a |. 'tother day to the
Home Secretary, and, as its mouthpiece, talking nonsense, which the
Times condenses thus:—
“, LoRD SHAFTEs BURY opened the subject in a very short speech, in which
he declared that the people had the greatest and strongest possible objection
to the opening of museums on Sundays, and there was no argument made use
of for the opening of museums which would not equally apply to the opening
of theatres.” -
“The people,” says your Lordship. But pray, who are “the
people’.” Surely, not, those whom your Lordship introduced * Your
deputation, says the Times, “was composed mainly of people of the
middle class, few artisans º were present.”
Now your Lordship surely knows that it is expressly for the artisans
that the Government has been asked to open the Museums, and your
deputation followed one which the Times says, was “composed of
bond ſide members of the artisan class,” whose spokesman was a
“Mister,” and spoke his mind out thus:–
“The sensible working-men of London could attest the necessity which
exists for other places being opened on that day besides churches, chapels, and
public-houses; and especially in the winter was this necessary, for there was
a craving among the people at large for intellectual cultivation, and in the
winter this could only be satisfied by the study of the works of art now to all
intents and purposes closed against the great mass of the people.”
From this your Lordship sees that there are other people whose
tastes should be consulted, as well as those whom you are pleased
to talk of as “the people.” As a rule, men of the middle class, whose
mouthpiece you were made, have many opportunities for leisure on a
week-day, and therefore have no need to “desecrate the Sabbath” by
studying the handicraft of Nature or Fine Art.
But they surely have no business to call themselves “the people.”
and to arrogate the right of shutting the museums in the faces of their
neighbours, whose only time for seeing them is Sunday afternoon, and
to whom the only alternative left open in the way of recreation is to
sit and smoke, and swill in some crime-breeding public-house.
Beseeching you in future, when you talk about “the people,” to
state clearly whom you mean, I have the honour to remain, your
Lordship's humble Servant, 33UINUIHA.
“A FICO FOR THE WORD.”
DESPERATE, uncompromising. Tories though we are, we own that
we do not much like this advertisement in the Athenaeum :—
HE PROPRIETOR of an influential and old-established Conser-
vative Weekly Paper in a large and fashionable city, and to which is added
a first-class and profitable Jobbing Business, &c.
Well, well, we may be º: but why Jobbing Business?. It
is not a pretty phrase. We, as a party, do understand jobbing, as it is
vulgarly called, and it would be difficult for us to get on without it.
But there is no sense in using ugly words. Why not say “unusual
facilities for carrying out arrangements in the interest of personal and
political friends?” That reads so much nicer.
A New League.
The tax on Armorial Bearings is to be increased. Those whom this
proposal will affect are already up in arms against it, and think of
making the Morning Herald the organ of their grievance. But the
are not likely to find supporters, and if they come into conflict wit
MR. Lowe will issue from it crest-fallen, for this being one of his
achievements, he cannot shield them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NIPPER and PooDEL call together on Porpoise. His shop is in a
theatrical neighbourhood, and it is not improbable that you may actu-
ally meet real actors (think of that!) coming out, or may pop in upon
MR. BUCKSTONE, or even the great MR. PHELPs trying on a wig ||
Such happiness as this does sometimes fall to the lot of persistent
amateurs. But though amateurs ; to Porpoise every º: visits
of actors, like those of angels, are few and far between—that is, in these
days of long runs and stupendous successes.
It would be a base calumny to call Porpoise a thin man, or even
stoutish. MR. Porpoise does not know what it is to be cold, and how
there comes to be anything left of Porpoise after a severely hot summer
is next door to miraculous. PoRPoisk, moves himself about the shop,
and about a room: , he, does not, walk; indeed, I don't think that
anyone ever yet saw his legs, which are generally behind a long white
apron which he wears, so to speak, theatrically; that is, if you were to
call a drama Porpoise, you would commence with such a stage direction
as this: “Apron goes up: legs discovered, standing.”
Porpoise has a wonderful memory;. order after order is given
verbally, every man singly, considering his the important case to which
Porpoise ought to give, if he knows his own interest, his whole and
sole attention, and, with only an occasional memorandum of an address,
not a lock of your wig that you were so careful in ordering, will be
omitted, not a curl twisted the wrong way, not a hair but as your
Worship commanded it...NIPPER is most exacting; so is AIF PooDEL.
They both try several wigs, and make #: at themselves in the
glass, Porpoise not moving a muscle. If MR. Porpoise is in a hurry,
and has more important business to attend to, he will smile, approv.
ingly, at the first face that either NIPPER, or ALF PooDEL pulls; which
admiration from such a man as Porpoise (“PoRPOISE, you know, who
is intimate with all the professionals, and doesn't laugh at things
unless they’re really good,” as NIPPER wisely puts it) decides either
of them at once. -
“I think that’ll do for Peter. Spriggins,” remarks Nipper, who
generally chooses a close crop of light or red hair.
“Couldn't be better, Sir,” returns Pokpoise; whereupon ALF
PooDEL, who is tired of waiting for his turn with Porpoise's wigs,
observes that if he (PooDEL) was * he should certainly fix on
that wig for Spriggins. By which he delicately hints to NIPPER, you

His general rule (when he doesn't give his mind to it, but works
mechanically) may be stated thus:— - -

“Shan’t. I black my eyebrows?”.inquires Yöting Geht, somebody's

ºff you like Širº says ºff more in sorrow than, in anger; as
much as to say, “ Weil, black 'em if you like; only a jolly guy you’ll
be when you’ve done it.” - -
So the Young Gent cedes his chair before the glass to some other
character, and goes into a corner to consult a friend as to “how, he

Qld Gent by MR. PoRPOISE. White powder all over. Black line
with thin paint-brush down each side of the nose. Little black of
burnt cork rubbed into cheeks where the hollow should be.
Three little lines at the corner of each eye.
More lines on the forehead. Whitened eyebrows.
“Grey,’air or scalp ?” asks MR.Poppoise. The Amateur replies by
asking which he, Pokpoise, thinks the better.
“You’re not to be too old, Sir P” says Porpoise, who hasn’t an idea
what the character is.
“No, not tºo old,” returns the Amateur, who beyond having learnt
the words of the part, knows as much about the character as Pörpoise
Seit.
“Grey 'air, then Sir's best,” says Porpoise,
adroitly on his customer's head.
Guards, Noblemen, and Peasants, Porpoise dismisses with a dab of
rouge on each cheek, and a bold dash of burnt cork when moustachios
are begged and prayed for.
PoRPoise is a º time making up NIPPE

waiting for two minutes and a half, “Hang it, Nipper, fºil dovery
well. Never saw anything better. Now let me come, asiºve got tº

Amateur, who has been bothering him, “There, Sir, there’s the hare's-
foot and the indian ink, you can make yourself up, can't you, Sir?”
and flattered by this opinion of Pokpoise's, the Amateur goes to work
gingerly, and experiences much difficulty as to getting the candles
right on either side of the glass. At the end of a quarter of an hour's
screwing up his mouth, elevating and º: his eyebrows, toning
down a splotch of black which qught to have been a thin line ...;
off a quantity of powder which had made him too pale, rubbing off apatc
of carmine which had made him too red, and having twice dipped the
aint-brush in the gum by mistake for the water, he refers himself to
oRPOISE, who, having painted, got up and done for an entire set of
characters while he has been hard at work on only one face, and that
his own, says without any show of triumph,
... Sit down, Sir. Now what are you, Sir P’’
“Sort of Brigand or Robber Captain,” returns the Amateur, and
in two minutes he leaves that chair the incarnation of scoundrelism;
that is, if burnt cork, indian ink and carmine go for anything.
The Ladies have a º deal of consultation about their own dresses,
Mºstically match their colours. They are so obliging to one
another.
“My dear,” says, MRs. ByRDE to KATE CHESSER, “if you like to
wear the mauve, I’ll wear the pink.” -
Then they discover that as they don't appear in the same scene
together, each can be left to her own choice.
So while they were all consulting about dresses, and li
make-ups, Goosey would be indefatigably practising the
song to Miss IDA’s accompaniment.
Then came the great Dress Rehearsal, which was to have commenced
at seven, but didn't till half-past eight, and when we only got through
half the operetta, and everybody lost their temper, except the couple
above-mentioned, who appeared thoroughly satisfied with everything
and everybody.

have a habit of deserting from one *ś and enlisting in another,
for the sake of the bounty money. So, for their identification, they
are branded with a tiny but ineffaceable D. The question is, whether
this should be done more than once. MR. CARDwell, did not approve
the practice at all, but said that the fraud in question was so common
that some effective method of checking it was necessary—and so the
matter stands. Why did not MR. BRAND speak?
Delicate question. Many bishops are so aged that they cannot do
their work. An intelligent mind will supply the rest of the story, and
MR. GLADSTONE said that he believed that the Bench was giving con-
sideration to the subject.
Tuesday. The new Member for Wareham took his oaths and seat.
Ha, Sirs, the name of MR. DRAx makes us young again. How is Mr.
GRANTLEY BERKELEY Remembereth he that grand day of sport,
when he mounted his steed, and
“Before his head was dog ODIN led,
And behind his tail came DRAx * *
The É. old days But drink, Sirs, we shall never be younger.
MR. DRAx was victor on that day, nevertheless GRANTLEy and ODIN
did their work well, and all but won that desperate game.
The Crypt under St.Stephen's Chapel is ready for divine service,
but MR. LAYARD said that if the House wished for that, they must
make some endowment for a minister. But why can't the House go
to, prayers there, and have their own excellent chaplain; thus getting
rid of the unseemly “devotional dogskin.” and other secularities?
GUIRE, in a very good speech, brought on a very good debate
on the Irish Society. One or two persons may “not exactly recollect
all about this Society, though of course they know generally *-and sº
forth, which means that they know nothing at all on, the subject, and
if we were to tell them (we’d scorn the action) that the Irish Society
was an association founded in Cork, in 1711, by WILLIAM.AND MARY,
for supplying pikes and testaments to the citizens of Ulster, they
would know no better. But they shall know better. , JAMES, THE
FIRST desired to plant, the confiscated lands in the north of Ireland
so, he composed a puff, as MR. MAGUIRE said, for the purpose of
inducing the London citizens to take the district in hand. Of course,
they were too wary to believe the King, but they sent four discreet
men, MEssRs. BROAD, FRIEsweLI, Rowiły, and MUNNs, to see how
far. His Majesty had told the truth. To the astonishment of the City,
the spies reported well of the Irish Canaan, and a Committee, which
afterwards became the Society, got a charter from the Crown. After
the settlement, of course the g began to play his usual tricks, and
at last their property was taken away, and they did not get a new
charter till 1670. Since that time they have managed much as might
be expected from London citizens, that is, on the whole honestly, but
with at least an eye and a half on London, and only half an eye on the
lrish. They have, naturally, had a vast deal of fun and º; out
of the revenues, but MR. Russell. GURNEY says that they have fairly
discharged their duty. The Irish Secretary thought that there was a
case for consideration, but not one which demanded any particular
urry. -
We had a slightly personal debate. A representative of the Great
House of Lowther İº once more been made Lord-Lieutenant of the
Counties of Cumberland and Westmoreland. The dynasty has endured,
we believe, some 130 years. MR. DISRAELI made this last appointment
a few days before resigning. It was challenged to-night by
MR. CHARLEs. HowARD. So MR. DISRAELI had to explain, in his
lofty comedy style, that he had not been actuated by dynastic conside-
rations. That MR. DisPAELI should flye such a thing away from the
heir of LoRD LoNSDALE, was really not to be expected; and
MR. GLADSTONE spoke up in his defence. The argument that a
moribund Cabinet ought not to give away patronage, MR. DISRAELI
met by observing, that if a Minister ceased to be a Minister before his
successor were appointed, there might be Dreadful Moments for which
nobody would be responsible, which was shocking and unconstitu-
tional. He said that he should have been happy to give the appoint-
ment to any other qualified person; but there was none.. CqLoNEL
LowTHER, the L. L. in question, had the pleasure of hearing himself
thus discussed; and MR. HowARD of course apologised to him, as
became an aristocratic neighbour. We must quote what MR. DISRAELI
said about his own resignation:-
“When the borough elections had well nigh concluded, it occurred to me
and my colleagues, who, however, were scattered over the country, that the

result was not satisfactory to us, and that it was most painful after the decla:
rations we had made, that we should continue to remain in the possession of
power and patronage (hear, hear), and therefore we took the earliest oppor-
tunity of considering our retirement. “Difficulties, however, for a time pre:
vented our arriving at an unanimous decision, but ultimately the Cabinet
arrived at the conclusion—and it was their unanimous decision—that the time
had arrived when it was their duty to retire from the post they then held.”
We should like to know something about the difficulties,” when
MR. DISRAELI happens to be communicative. Who wanted to stick
in, and fight the 120?
Wednesday. Asked whether the MAYor of TYNEMOUTH had prohi-
bited MuRPHY, the firebrand, from lecturing, the HQME SECRETARY
said that he had, and by the authority of the Home Office. Very right
too. MR. WHALLEY raged in silence that, day, but next night said
that he was making arrangements to send out a dozen Murphies to
plant the Protestant standard. Thank Providence, there be a dozen
gaols to accommodate these missionaries. -
Nearly all the sitting was given to the Bill ſor Protecting the Property
of Married Women. MR. Jessel, Q.C., explained that a married
woman, in England, in 1869, occupies just the legal position formerly
assigned to our slaves, even to flogging and imprisonment, which are,
y the common law, still recognised as the right of the husband. Punch
doubts whether the majority of married women are aware of this fact.
filet them be thankful that iº rarely use their rights. The Bill
was read a Second Time, in an assembly consisting for the most part of
married men, which fact speaks well for masculine nature.
Debate on the Sunday Trading Bill was adjourned. Somebody
stated, and somebody else agreed, that the upper classes observe
Sunday much more łºń, than they used to do, and thereby set a
good example. , Mr. Punch, mentioned this with pleasure, at the
Zoological Gardens (not the “Zoo,” you mimic of a music hail cad) on
Sunday last, and again at the one of the eleven aristocratic dinners
to which he was invited for that evening.
Thursday. The Irish Church fight recommenced. You are aware
that, when a Bill has been read a Second Time, it goes into Committee;
that is, the mace is taken off the table, the SPEAKER delightedly resigns
his sway to MR. DoDsoN, whom Members address; and it is permitted
to everybody to speak as often as he pleases—if the Committee will
hear him. But before going into Committee, it is necessary that a
motion should be carried to the effect that such journey be taken; and
it is open to anybody to resist this. As MR. GLADSTONE explained
the Previous }ººk Mr. Punch deems it proper to educate in similar
fashion. Well, MR. NEW DEGATE, the great Protestant, being deter-
mined to hinder the Irish, Bill as much as he could, opposed the
motion for going into Committee, and this whole night was
occupied with a renewal of the debate on the general question.
Nearly all the speakers were Conservatives, and none of them had any-
thing new to urge, with the exception of MR. Raikes. This gentleman
adverted to a recent cartoon of Mr. Punch's, in which the Irish Church,
as Ariel, is seen delivered from the encumbrances of State trammels,
and rising free and beautiful. MR. RAIKEs complained that, inasmuch
as the Church was to be stripped of all that she had, Mr. Punch should
have depicted her as entirely undraped. There is no objection to the
unclad figure, if treated with purity, as you will own when you shall
have seen a certain picture by MR. I. EIGHTON this year, and there is
great objection to it, when treated as French artists and their wretched
imitators do, and Mr. Punch was not deterred, as MR. RAIKEs sug-
gested, by fear of the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN. But he was deterred by
the fear of putting forth that which would not have been true, seeing
that MIss EccLESIA HIBERNICA has by no means been stripped, but
left with an exceedingly handsome fortune. MR. DISRAELI regrette
that MR.NEWDEGATE had opposed the regular stage of proceedings,
as the principle of the measure had been affirmed, and he wished to get
at real work. But MR. NEwdEGATE would divide, and the Government
got a larger majority than before, 355 to 229–126.
MR. # SHERIDAN this week carried a motion for making the
Metropolitan Railway folks provide smoking carriages. They must
paint }. vehicles in an unmistakeably distinctive manner, or in the
rush during the half-minute stop there will be no end of mistakes,
with rows to follow.
Friday. We went into Committee, and MR. DISRAELI moved to
leave out the Second Clause of the Bill. This enacts that on the 1st
of January, 1871, “the Union between the Churches of England and
Ireland shall be dissolved.” MR. DISRAELI, without desiring to inter-
ſere with the object of the Bill, wished the Union between the Churches
preserved, as the maintenance of the º Supremacy alone would
secure liberty. Most elaborate debate followed, but the real answer
was, that it is left entirely to the will of the Church of the Future to
ask the QUEEN, to reign over it, appoint its bishops, and otherwise
protect it, but that it is due to the Protestants to give them the liberty
of choice. MR. DisrAELI contended that the Roman Catholic religion
was already established in Ireland, under the Supreme Pontiff, and
that the Anglican Church ought to have a similar advantage. He
finished the debate with an animated peroration, and the Committee
finished it by a division which rejected MR. DISRAELI's motion by
344 to 221—majority, 123. -- - - - - -
We are f. on with the debate at all Fº times, until the Bill
has gone through Committee. Mr. Punch would give a hint to those
who are congratulated on having “found their voices”—that is, have
learned that they can amuse themselves by making noises, and pre-
venting speakers from proceeding. There be bores who must, in
the fitness of things, be shut up; but there must be, no
system of disturbance. This measure is more important than
any holidays, grouse, or continental tours, and, ample time must
be given for its discussion. And for those who will not listen to argu-
ment, but require menace, Mr. Punch would, gently urge that the
Lords are hostile to the whole scheme, and will assent to it only in
consideration of its being sent to them as an expression of the will of
the nation, as represented in the Commons. . If the Lords are able to
say that ..". been stifled, they will have an excuse for asking
that the Bill be re-considered below. So we recommend the noisy
Members to go on the terrace, and chaff the bargemen, and so get rid of
their excess of legislative steam.
A SENSIBLE PETITION.
To the House of Common Sense in Parliament Assembled,—
. The Humble Petition of the Ginshop-keepers, Publicans, and
other Pious Persons,
Sheweth, That an infamous attempt is being made by certain
sacrilegious and misguided British Workmen to persuade your House
to deseerate the sanctity of the Sabbath by throwing open certain
places of mundane recreation, such as Galleries of Pictures, Art-
Museums, and the like. -
That such places are supported by the money of the nation, and should
therefore be kept closed upon the Sabbath day, if ever so minute a
minority of the nation, perchance, should think it proper. -
That improvement of the mind is alleged as an excuse for this
unholy desecration; but as improvement of the mind implies an
exercise, or work, it is breaking a commandment to improve one's
art of its revenue from drink, and
mind on Sunday.
That the nation gets a ſº -
ought therefore to support the trade of those who sell it. -
hat if galleries and museums be opened on the Sabbath, their
attractions will materially diminish the attendance at the ginshops,
which are now the only places of rational amusement that, on Sunday
afternoons, are open to poor people. - -
That British workmen state that they can not compete with foreigners
in elegant design and rare artistic handicraft, while they are denied the
means of studying the fine arts, for which their only leisure is the
afternoon of Sunday. --- - - -
That if British workmen take to competition with the foreigner in
matters of intelligence, they perhaps may, lose their relish for the
. of the beer shops, and will entail thereby a heavy loss on the
ºxchequer. - -
That, moreover, Hampton Court is graciously permitted to be open
after Church hours, and º amateurs have there the opportunity
of cultivating profitably their taste for the fine arts, by studying the
Beauties of the Court of CHARLEs THE SEconD. - -
Your Petitioners, therefore pray that, for the sake of public piety,
“public” worship be .. as heretofore, upon the Sabbath—that
is to say, the worship of the public-house.
A Trifle for Pesth.
RIDE a cock horse,
To WAMBERY cross, , . -
And hear that we’ve gained, in Shere Ali, a loss:
That we ought to snub Russia,
And stamp on her toes,
And think her a Burglar wherever she goes.
The Greater Contains the Less.
Miss BURDETT Coutts has withdrawn her name from the list of
candidates for Election as Guardians of the Poor of Bethnal Green.
Mr. Punch cannot regret this. -
The smaller office is, included in the larger one,—which Miss
BURDETT CouTTs already holds for life—that of Guardian of the Poor
ſof all London.
A GREAT LOSS.
A Second Course of Lectures for Ladies is now being delivered at
South Kensington on “Size and Shape.” . The Nova Scotian Giantess
and the Circassian Lady would be suitable living illustrations of his
subject.

inadequate supply of bridesmaids, and have they struck for more
expensive lockets? Or is nobody in future going to marry on less
than a thousand a year, and a brougham, and a man-servant, and a
Sèvres dinner service P - -
These are questions of serious import, almost too grave for lights,
and flowers, and Pompadour dresses, and sparkling wines; and rather
befitting that still, solemn hour when the guests are assembling, and
the great people of the party are terribly late, and the hostess is
i. and the shy desperate, and the cook, below, an incipient
unatic.
But asked they must be, if we are not all making arrangements to
o into monasteries and nunneries, and precedence this inquiry into
the diminution of gentlemanly and gentlewomanly marriages ought to
have, unless celibacy is to be the humour and fashion of the day, over
every other topic, except, perhaps, the Married Women's º
Bill, an excellent measure, but one unforeseen consequence of whic
will be, and it is right that the Select Committee should know it,
—that we shall be forced prematurely into marriage with Rosa MQND
DAYBELL, because, good little woman as she is, she is scarcely equal to
the absolute, disposal of the four thousand pounds left her by an
excellent maiden aunt, happily unencumbered with any such absurd
nonsense as trustees, or sole and separate use, or freedom from
marital control. - -
Whilst you are at table take the º: asking whether anybody
knows anything about “Semolina,” to be relieved in future, by the kind
permission of MR. Lowe, from a d eeable duty; and why SELINA
and WILHELMINA are not to be similarly favoured? Perhaps, also, you
may be able to find out what “bere or bigg” is, eatable or drinkable,
and whether “Manna croup” (which reminds one unpleasantly of the
diseases of infancy) is an article of food commonly met with, and to
what culinary º: “cassava powder” and “mandioca flour” are
most frequently applied. , Moreover, if you take a glass of beer with
your cheese (this is not vulgar, is it?), seek to know what “Mum” is,
a thirty-six gallon barrel of which delicacy is henceforth, unless the
Conservative party see a lurking danger to the British Constitution in
this daring innovation, to be assessed at a guinea; and if .#
with the usual deplorable ignorance of society, is silent, say to yourself,
“Mum’s the word,” and call for a draught of “spruce,”—another beve-
rage which is to be made more accessible, -certain that no well-educated
ºf will ever permit his master's sideboard to lack this refreshing
rink.
If you are not interested in the Conference of the Irish Chureh, or
the Hudson's Bay Company (you may extract a little geographical
amusement out of this far away Fur Land, if so disposed), it will be
only natural that over your wine you should draw attention to the voter

to one of the Election Judges. In the drawing-room you will not, we
are confident, neglect your old friend, the Weather, who has latel

running into all sorts of excesses with thermometers; nor fail to mention
the return of those volatile absentees, the swallows, to their accus-

which some observant naturalist heard earlier than usual on
Knightsbridge Green; and the “Swedish Nightingale” of our day,
CHRISTINE NILSSON, who is to come with the bloom and blossom of
May; and SIR MICHAEL Costa (not many worthier Knights than he);
and the report that Her Majesty's Theatre will not be used as a gran
Music Hall; and the clever young actress at the Globe, Miss MAGGIE
BRENNAN, and MR. KING, the excellent new Hamlet at D Lane;
and velocipedes, handsomer cabs, and street tramways; º all the
other topics of the hour and the day.
THE HAIR ON LAW.
THE Police Force are in future not to be forced to use the razor, lip
and chin are no longer to go bare. This change in the facings of the
§º: which will make them more than ever airyfavourites, is not
the result of a shaying clause in an Act of Parliament, but of an order,
we might say an Imperial decree, of the Chief Commissioner, who in
such matters is supreme. By those who are sticklers for the liberty of
the subject, some alarm is felt lest we should now be bearded by the
Police; but this is a groundless apprehension, and may be dismissed
at once without the interference of SIR THoMAs HENRy. On the
whole, the Force is to be congratulated on this change of hair, which
to look well should be uniform; but having experience of the disposi-
tion of the vulgar in the streets of London, adults as ill as boys, to
offer unpleasant personal remarks, we shalf feel for P.C. during the
i. season., A. sudden thought. Now that, the tax is going to

THE only Englishman that ever had his great toe saluted as that of the Soverei

however, on occasion talk as much like a true born Briton as he could if he, too, had been, a

“The Pope is annoyed that so many of the presents consist of crosses, and the other day he remarked
to some members of his household, “I have too many crosses. What I want is money, money, and still

This speech will raise the Holy Father in JoHN BULL's estimation, as a man of the world, who

“And we're all grumbling-grumb, grumb,

ALL must own the House of Commons,
Though dear to all who sit in it,
Is too small for six hundre
And fifty-eight to fit in it.
That its seats aren't wide enough for
Broad based administrations,
Such as, in lukewarm periods,
lan measures and rule nations.
No wonder names with Stephen
Our House of Commons rs;
The first of martyrs he was,
And M.P.'s say they are martyrs:
Stretched out, a la Saint Lawrence,
Upon a huge grid-iron, .
wiłł DR. PERcy down-stairs,
A-making of the fire on.
Members should be men of mettl
By the means employed to mould one:
Now blown up by a hot blast
Now cooled down by a cold one.
With Father Thames exhaling
Breath a mud-lark fit to smother;
And in default of sweet air
The sewers distilling t'other.
Then for distinguished visitors
There’s no room on occasion,
Unless upon each other's laps
The #. accommodation.
And the ladies in the cage have
Most inconvenient quarters,
Not to speak of their susurrus
Distracting the reporters.
And as the House is too small
For all its Members, keen’ums
Who want seats put a hat down
By way of locum tenens.
Punch don't object to that, but
By cynics it may said be,
Seats should not be kept by hat, but
Should only kept by head be.
There's one way to a new House:
If BARRY would build over
The Court outside the old one,
M.P.'s would sit in clover.
And as the Commons' power
The Crown's has caused the stop of ;
There’s reason good the Commons
Should sit a Court a-top of.
But Colonel, FRENCH objects that
This would destroy the dining-room;
Letting M.P.'s in the basement,
For eating, gain by '...; room.
And he maintains that Members
Would be anything but winners
If they improved debates,
By dis-improving dinners.
The Colonel feels that forces
eed for their conservation,
What the French, in phrase well chosen,
Entitle “restauration.”
And now that folks are zealous
For Commons' preservation,
The Collective Wisdom's dining
Is of moment to the nation.
Whoe'er comes near the Commons
As second beat will fare with them;
'Tis like them, the Lords' dining-rooms,
To ask the Peers to share with them.
Now Peers' rights to graze the Commons
Are assailed with doubts and aneers:
It’s too bad to give the Commons
Grazing rights upon the Peers.

BIRDS, BEASTs, AND FISHEs.
CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH...-WE ENTER THE SUPPER-ROOM-LADY
DODO'S ADVICE–A SAYING OF PORCUPINE'S.–THE PERFORMERS
APPEAR–M R. FYSCHER—MISS CHESSER–SIGNOR CORMORAN TI-
LADY LYNX'S EYE-GLASSES.
BIRDS, Beasts, and Fishes, certainly come out strongly in a supper-
room. The Birds are there to be seen swooping, or peckin
Beasts gorging themselves, and mumbling over their food; and the
Fishes, drinking as if they had been suffering from drought for a
fortnight past.
LADY DQDo's advice to the MACAws has been “In giving a large
party like this, my dear, you must of necessity make a sort of salad of
it. But an excellent salad; for that is an appetiser, of which who eats
once desires again to taste—and that is your object at starting. There-
fore, my dear, season your salad with a sprinkling of the professional
herb. A couple of eminent musicians, an author or two, an actor, a
singer here and there—foreign of course, that is in the case of women—
because a foreigner, with us has no antecedents, and as a ".
is admitted to our Society by virtue of her professional reputation
only—and, in fact, dear, any other notability who is a notability, and
whom your guests feel some curiosity to meet. An acquaintance with
these people will cost }. something, perhaps, but you are well repaid
in return. You will have to be a patron for benefits; you will feel it
necessary to purchase a picture; to help Madame or Signor in getting
up their select concert at some rooms; taking so many tickets at a
guinea a head yourself. ... If you, manage this well, you will find your
account in it. Your parties will be unique, and, in time, even Royalty
itself may express a wish to visit your salon.”
This picture nearly took MRs. MACAw's breath away; and is it a
wonder if she used all her influence with her husband for the benefit
of LADY Dodo's little property P Royalty at her house ! PRINCE
EAGLET himself, accompanied by a Royal Duke, dashing up to the
hall-door in the well-known Royal carriages, and, walking behind
them, MAJOR JACKAL, Equerry in Waiting, who somehow, in
MRs. MACAw's mind, gets mixed up with “all the Royal Family,” for
whom she devoutly prays in Church every Sunday.
And well may a pious, fashionable congregation, supplicate Heaven
on behalf of these August Personages, upon?whose health depends all
the gaiety of the summer in London; or, as ToM PoRCUPINE observed
there might be a special clause introduced to the effect that, if
Providence did intend anything unpleasant to Royal Families, it might
be deferred till, at all events, the end of the season. But this was
only what ToM Porcupix E said; and then, as Miss CHESSER told
him, he was so satirical: whereat ToM snorted, and probably thought
# himself that the young lady was, unconsciously, the more satirical of
le two.
The amateur opera is over, and everybody is delighted: some
because they liked it as well as they liked anything; some because
they didn't care for it one way or the other, and to praise was the
more pleasant; and some (and they were enthusiastic) because, what-
cyer its merits or demerits, it was over.
MR. KING FYschER enters the room ready to receive the congratu-
lations of everybody, and to ask the musical professionals, when
he can take one or two of them aside, what they really did think of
it, as if their opinion given in public was what they really didn't think
of it.
MRs. MACAw is profuse in her thanks to the Young Composer, who
smiles and blushes deprecatingly, and looks helplessly at the jobster.
salad in the distance. Several gentlemen are eager for an introduction
to Miss CHESSER, and vie with one another in supplying her with
supper. She has a short triumph over Miss SKYLARK, who comes up
to say how much she was delighted, how admirably she (Miss CHESSER)
played her part, and how fatigued she must be after her exertions.
MR. RATTELs NAYKE being an old hand at this sort of thing, accepts

YRDE in a quiet corner, where far be it from me to intrude upon
them. MR. ByRDE will come up Fº to mention the existence of
the carriage, and MRs. ByRDE will reply that “If he is tired he needn't
wait for her, as,” she explains, “he has to be up, so early for business
in the morning; ” and undertakes to see herself home after a dance or
two, for which amusement she knows, he doesn't care. Old ByRDE,
very much MRs. ByRDE's senior, wouldn't on any account be consi-
ered a jealous man, but doats and doubts, and—and—in fact, lights a
cigar, and goes home to bed. Heavens ! if married couples can't trust
one another for a waltz, out of each other's sight, for an hour or two,
what a miserable world this would be . -
DoRMouse of course went off to sleep in the middle of the evening's
entertainment, and was neither useful behind the scenes, nor orna-
mental in front of them. -
Miss IDA DRAKE looks very pretty and very flushed on emerging
from the screen behind which she has been accompanying the opera all
the evening; and, I warrant you, there is a certain seat in the ante-
room where a certain young gentleman, when he has got out of his
g; the f
brigand’s dress and resumed the ordinary garments of private life, will
be ready to meet her, and escort her proudly to the supper-room.
...MR. KING FYsgHER, who is ambitious (as what amateur composer,
if he thinks himself worth anything, is not?) wants to get SIGNOR Cor-
MoRANTI's opinion. The Signor is hard at work with another profes-
sional friend at the supper, and being challenged by FYschER to cham-
}. politely takes that opportunity of congratulating his youn
riend on his work, and then urges him to sup, not wishing at tha
moment to relinquish his own delightful occupation for the sake of
orcing a conversation.
But FYscHER is not to be put off. He wants the Signor's genuine
opinion, and commences a learned musical conversation with that
eminent person, carried on in technical terms, and involving all sorts
of questions as to the capabilities of a mezzo, so-and-so's range, the ex-
pression of an andante, and so on, and expatiates upon the difficulties
of getting “amateurs” (he lifts himself quite above them for the time
being) to do justice to his work.
The Signor agrees with him in everything; he advises him to work
and “do something for us,” whereby he insinuates that the lyric drama
is waiting for an opera from the pen of MR. KING ... who is, of
course, delighted at the notion, and, being sanguine, sits down in his
dressing-gown when he gets home ſhe affects a dressing-gown when
composing, having seen a portrait of BEETHoveN in that costume, with
turn-down ... writes, off-hand, a chorus of soldiers and peasants
(without words), a tenor song, and something sentimental for a
soprano, in which he sees the elements of his future grand work at
Her Majesty's or Covent Garden.
LADY Lynx is there too, a great friend of LADY Dodo's ; somewhat
younger than that elderly owager. Having done ample justice
to the supper, she is ‘ī. a little interval of rest previous to
refreshing herself (when MR. Poodel shall offer it) with just one little
glass of champagne more; and she is delivering, sotto voce, her notion
of the performers. PooDEL is runnin everybod down; LADY LYNX
says, “Oh, I don't think M.R. NIPPER did that badly”—meaning as the
Comic Walter. -
“I don't say badly,” replies PooDEL, who sees himself in the
character. “It was vulgar;” and LADY LYNX taps him on the hand
with her fan; and the reason for the interruption is made obvious by
her saying,
“Ah, MR, NIPPER, how good! how charming " And PooDEL has
to modify his expression without absolutely eating his words in the
presence of LADY LyNx, by whom he doesn't want to be set down as
an arrant humbug. “Yes, it was very good, NIP,” says he, with a critical
air. ... “But you, as an artist” (this flatters Nipper, but doesn't
deceive him), “mustn't mind my being a little disappointed with one
or two parts where I thought you lost a point.”
NIPPER professes himself §: to hear his faults, and LADY
LYNX leaves them, to stand alone for a few seconds, surveying the
scene through her eyeglasses. Good gracious ! she doesn't want eye-
glasses! There’s nothing in that room that escapes her; and so I go
up, and, knowing what her ladyship wants, bring her a glass of
sparkling champagne; in return for which she tells me who is who,
and also enlightens me, socially, as to what is what.

II.--THE MODEST FISHERMAN.
(To a Catching Air.)
THERE was such a modest man,
That he used to use a fan,
To hide his blushing face, I know.
If you'd ever seen his head
Popping out above his bed,
He’d have fainted in a fit. -
Just so, just so,
Chorus. He’d have fainted in a fit, just so.
Now this very modest man
Went and bought a fishing-can,
For a-fishing he wanted to go;
All alone he read in books
How to use his lines and hooks,
And he practised in his bath, .
Just so, just so.
Chorus. And he practised in his bath, just so.
Now I cannot tell his name,
Nor the county whence he came :
If you press me, I must always answer “no.
And if you ask me why
I refuse, I must reply,
Because I don't know, -
- Just so, just so.
Chorus. "Tis because I do not know.
He travelled to the North
Long beyond the Frith of Forth,
And a boat he hired to row;
But they said, “What the deuce
Of a boat, Sir, is the use,
If a-fishing you’d go,” -
- Just so, just so.
Chorus. If a-fishing you would go, just so.
So he paid his money down,
It was more than half-a-crown,
For a man who the way would show;
Says he, "You'll take my rod,
For the tittlebat and cod,”
Says the man “sman; “Yes;
Just so, just so.”
Chorus. Says the man a-grinning. Yes, just so.
Then there came another man,
For the job two miles he ran,
And his mate he called him Joe,
And they carried rods and cans,
Nets and compasses and plans,
In single file they marched.
Just so, just so.
Chorus. In single file they marched, just so.
Say the men, “In this here stream
Swim perch and dace and bream,
And mackerel and trout also.”
And angrily he cried—
- “Just so, just so.”
Chorus. And angrily he cried, just so.
When for hours he had fished,
“It isn't what I wished,”
He exclaims in a tone of woe;
“And oh, I so perspire,
If, my friends, you will retire,
I shall jump into the stream,
- - Just so, just so.”
Chorus. I shall jump into the stream, just so.
So they went behind the rocks,
Which formed a sort of docks
Round the bath which lay below:
First he looks about, then peels,
Then you only see his hee
As he jumps into the stream
Just so, just so.
Chorus. As he jumps into the stream, just so.
When twice or thrice he'd dived
He felt very much revived,
And he scrambled on the bank. But, lo!
Though he stood upon tiptoes
He saw no clothes nor hose,
He must walk home as he is—
Just so, just so.
Chorus. He must walk home as he is, just so.
Now, what was he to do?
I do not know, do you?
And the time passed very slow;
He had nothing on his back,
And he couldn't get a sack,
Nor a waistcoat, nor a pair–
Just so, just so.
Chorus. He was very much perplexed, just so.
He was never seen again,
Ah! I mention it wit *..."
But a figure, with a face like dough,
Is at night seen in the North

For the somethings he has lost,

The Legend has been told, just so,

Through the valley for his breeks,
And vanishes if once you show.

MISS CUBA AND HER OFFERS.
PRESIDENT GRANT (not the P.R.A.) is asked to recognise the Republic of Cuba.
Of course it will be asked, with excessive wit, “what’s He-Cuba to him or He
to Cuba?” But when the laughter shall have in some degree abated, Mr. Punch
{{...} through the appropriate smoke of his mild Havannah, that if he were a
Qu he should gesticulate in a most remarkable manner for such recognition.
for those who dºn’t know an hing about the matter are therefore probably
unaware that the unfortunate Queen of the Antilles has been used worse than
BoADICEA, or any other unfortunate female sovereign. She has been kept in
vassalage by Spain simply that any general, or other court favourite whom it was
desired to enrich, might go out to Cuba and make his fortune, no matter how.
He soon came home, wealthy with Cuban plunder. Now, of course, the new
Spanish Government intends to patronise every virtue, that lived with, Bishop
BERKELEY. But a Republic in the hand is worth two Constitutions in the bush.
We have no burning desire to see Cuba annexed to the dominions of KING Ulysses,
but we are not altogether astonished at her emulating MRs. ARTEMUs WARD's
courtship, and º with an indescribable look at the American lover, “If you
mean gittin hitched, I’m on.”
TO HANG, OR NOT TO HANGP
It is probable, as the Pall Mall Gazette says, that,
“If the time should ever come when certain vague and ill-understood notions, which
shelter, themselves under the phrase of the sanctity of human life, are permitted to be
rationally considered, the question will be asked about others as well as murderers, and
may receive an answer which would more or less surprise the present generation.”
If the sanctity of human life is to be held absolutely inviolable, sing old Rose and
burn the gallows. But if that apparatus is to be employed at all, is there much more
occasion for its employment given by the cutter of a single throat than by the
breaker of numerous, hearts, and the causer of several suicides? If CALCRAFT is
necessary for the protection of Society from ruffians, is he not equally needful for
its :". i. rogues whose fraud entails upon their victims death, and ruin
to which death may be preferable. Hang fraudulent directors, or hang not at all.

COLLARS FOR COLONISTS.
OUR Colonial Friends will be enchanted to hear (as they
have just been told) that they may be made Knights, if they
deserve and desire the honour. An alteration has been
made, in their favour, in the statutes of the Most Distin-
uished Order of St. Michael and St. George. Mr. Punch's
ſº. are full of orders, stars, chains, jewels, and the like
auds, and he really forgets whether he has St. M. and
gº G., among them. Consulting, however, his dearly;
beloved Debrett, which is always at his hand, by day and
by night, he perceives that the motto is Auspicium melioris
avi, which, meaning the Promise of a Pleasant Evening,
makes the collar just the thing to go out to dinner in.
The Chancery of the Order is the Colonial Office; and as
there are some capital fellows among the Knights, and as
he would like to give the Order a good start, Mr. Punch,
Member for all the Colonies, will trouble LoRD GRANVILLE
to send up a few collars, that Mr. Punch may try them on.
The ribbon is watered Saxon blue, which just suits his
delicate complexion.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 19. Rather a fragmentary sort of week hath to be
accounted for Dear LoBD, REDEs DALE began it by bothering about
that eternal Coronation Oath, which he still thinks debars the QUEEN
from passing the Irish Church Bill. Punch utterly declines to try any
more to make bim understand the case, especially as he has now got to
the point of demanding an Act of Parliament enabling HER MAJESTY
to dispense with the obligations of the Qath; -
absolve herselſ from it with the aid of the Estates. But will, she not
do so in ordering La Reine le reut to be said over the Irish Bill? LoRD
RepesDALE seems to think the QUEEN is a personage of the mental
calibre of GeoRGE THE THIRD, who replied to the explanation that
he had sworn in an executive and not a legislative capacity, “None of
your Scotch metaphysics;” or of GeoRGE THE FourTH, who, in a
sober interval, wept over a Bill which he thought would affect, his
holy religion. Lord MELBourne's pupil knows all about it, dear
LoRD REDESDALE, and you know all about railways. Stick to 'em.
A Bill in regard to the Indian Council brought up the new peer,
LoRD LAwRENCE, amid general applause. He spoke for half-an-hour,
very calmly, and as one who thoroughly understood his subject. He
said that Lord MAyo was but carrying out with the Afghans a policy
Initiated by Lord LAWRENCE. There, M. WAMBERY. -
MR. BRight, on cigar smoking, commanded much, attention. He
objected to compel the Metropolitan Railway to provide smoking car;
riages, as the trains would soon arrive every two minutes, and it would
be impossible to sort, first the three classes, and then the three classes
of smokers. So what was good for the Metropolitan District lines was
held not to be good for the Metropolitan, and MR. SHERIDAN was
defeated by 31. -
Sickly soldiers before discharge are not “cupped until the world
goes round,” or at all, except for medical purposes. -
We then went again into Committee on the Irish Church Bill.
Every amendment on which the Opposition divided was rejected by a
large majority. MR. DISHAELI had, we are sorry to say, HoRACE
That is, the QUEEN is to F
self, rose from his
WALPolº’s “Remedy,” so could not attend, and MR. HARDY took the
defeats in his absence, The date of Disendowment was fixed at
January 1, 1871, the clause for effecting it was carried, the Irish
Bishops were turned out of the House of Lords, and the Committee
would not alter the clause for deducting compensation to curates from
the income to incumbents. On this last division the Conservatives got
their largest number since they divided on the Second Reading, but the
figures were 330 to 232.
Tuesday. The Lords discussed, and the Government disapproved, .
Bill of Lord CLANRICARDE's on the Tenure of Irish Land. The Bill
is a mild one, and its object is to compel the use of Written Agree-
ments for letting. But the mass of Irish tenants do not like this, and
#. verbal engagements, as more elastic. It is difficult to supply
ocuments to an Affectionate People that settles conveyancing instru-
ments by the light of the flash of a blunderbuss; but if the system could
be enforced, good would be done. Some Conservative Lords joined in
the debate, rather (if Mr. Punch might be permitted to wink his
thought) with the hope of extracting some damaging information as to
Government Land plans, than for the sake of helping to adjust the
|. But Lords GRANVILLE and KIMBERLEY would not be
rawn, and so were informed that the Administration no doubt held
dangerous and revolutionary views as to the rights of property, and
that they, would be responsible for all the Tipperary murders next
winter. After which pleasantness, their Lordships went away.

Then did we not have a sensation ?
the House P There was debate on the Site of the New Courts of Law.
The lawyers wish to adhere to the Carey Street location, and there are
other objections to doing this besides the primá facie one that the
• course is acceptable to our natural enemies. The public, directed by
the Demon of Taste, according to SIR RoundELL PALMER, wish the
new building to adorn our noble Thames Embankment. When the
discussion had been protracted far into the night, the CHANCELLOR or
THE ExchEQUER rose, like Samson Agonistes, to spoil all the architec-
ture. Ile would agree to neither plan.
“This uttered, straining all his nerves, he bowed
As with the force of winds and waters pent,
When mountains tremble, those two massy buildings
With horrible convulsion to and fro
He tugged, he shook, till they came out and drew
Their two roofs after them, with burst of thunder,
Upon the heads of all who sat to hear.

was sentenced to imprisonment
thrown out by the House of Lords, as matter of course.
Pardon the slight variation on MILTON. But MR. Lowe, like the
magnificent Armado, did excel Samson. For he not only destroyed, he
erected. As for the Carey Street plan, it would cost Four Millions and
more, and he would be no party to such extravagance. Nor would he
build on the Embankment. But there was a site already cleared,
between Cecil and Arundel Streets, Strand, and bounded on the north
by Howard Street, which could be had for a reasonable sum, and there
he proposed to build the Temple of Law. It would have no Strand
front, but might have a splendid front towards the river. As he spoke,
ather Thames, now a nice clean old man, quite unlike his former dirty
urified tide, putting little, salmons and whitebait
tenderly aside, and | out his arms to the virgin Themis, imploring
her to come and be his beautiful neighbour and love. Behold the
Cartoon. Finally, MR. Low E said that INIGo Jones had planned a
Palace for CHARLEs the FIRST near the suggested spot, the plans were
to be seen, and might be adopted. The House, simply staggered,
could only beg that the subject might be adjourned; and in about three
weeks the Australian Slasher is to produce a Government scheme.
Temple, Bar, again saved, has been in such a paroxysm of joy ever
since, that we hear that MEssRs. CHILDs' employés complain of its
S ––
unseemly agitation, and threaten to ballast it with a few tons of sove-
reigns, if it will not keep quiet.
Electors of Dublin, an address was carried for inquiry into your
Electioneering behaviour. Step out now, and say something for your-
selves, for we’re in a mighty purifying mood.
Wednesday. Of course, a new and reformed Parliament must be
asked for its opinion as to marrying your Wife's Sister. We had the
usual arguments, and the battle was ended by two of the Ministers,
who opposed each other with all their might. MR. BRIGHT had never
heard any real argument against the alteration of the law. He was a
Quaker, and his sect had always allowed such marriages. Warriors
and lords were bad enough, as SIR John ColeRIDGE's relative, the
reat poet, had said, but priests were worse, and the opposition to this
ill was ecclesiastical rubbish. The Solicitor-GENERAL, nothing
moved by the family quotation, responded that Christianity had for
1500 years repudiated such marriages, that it was a woman’s question,
and that the women of England were not converted to the new doc-
But it is trine. He objected to the change
Did not MR. Lowe astonish
“Because it endangers one of the most blessed and delightful relations
which can exist between man and woman, because it narrows the circle of the
affection into which passion cannot enter, an affection which cultivates the
highest and purest parts of our nature, and which they would all agree with
MR. BRight in characterising as being that to which we owe a debt greater
than we can express.”
On division the Second Reading was carried by 243 to 144, majority
99, and the ladies in the cage called their gallery instantly set up such
a clatter, clapping hands, waving handkerchiefs, and rattling parasols,
that Mr. Punch, who seldom wonders at anything a woman does
almost wondered at such a demonstration, though he sternly rebuked
a cynical Member near him, who growſed that a good many females
seemed very anxious for the deaths of their sisters. The Bi p. be

LoRD Lyttleton moved the Second Reading of a Bill for making a
great lot of new little Bishops—“subscription Bishops,” as the DUKE
of SoMERset amiably called them. The real Baron-Bishops gave it
but scant approval. CANTERBURY, York, LoNDON, GLOUCESTER spoke
against it. LoRD CARNARvoN said that these were not times when
folks would be very ready to risk ecclesiastical or educational endow-
ments. We hear you, my Lord. LoRD LYTTLEton said he had been
called an enthusiast, but he had no desire to be particularly enthu-
siastic on that or any other question—it was merely a matter of
authentic and common sense. The Bill was rejected by 43 to 20.
Home SecBETARY BRUCE was asked why he had not hung one
WILTshire, who had been sentenced to death for an atrocious outrage,
since which he had committed another, and who, if you kill anybody at
all, seems certainly a savage of whom this world might as well be rid.
MR. BRUCE had a very good answer in the representations of ten of
the jury, and in the recommendation of MR. Justice HANNEN. But
he desired to show that he had discharged his duty properly: out of
eleven persons sentenced since he came into office, two proved to be
innocent, one was insane, two had been sent to penal servitude for
life, and he had hanged the other six. The House applauded.
Irish Church again, and Compensation to Curates. If you want
details, the daily papers are open to you. One amendment, in the
interest of the poor Curates, was agreed to by M.R. GLADstone, and a
reasonable present is to be made to them. The Organists make a
noise, but do not receive much favour, which is not wonderful, if the
Ministers have often heard Irish church organs. The only incident
was rather a neat quotation by MR. BERESFORD HoPE, who, looking
towards MR. SYNAN, Catholic Member for Limerick County, said,
“Wictorque SINoN incendia miscet
Insultans.”
Now this was good, and Mr. Punch is not pleased with MR. Synan,
who, instead of accepting a classical fling as a compliment, as scholars
and gentlemen usually do, answered angrily, and borrowed a second-
hand epithet of scoff at MR. HoPE. An Irishman not take a joke
Could he not—for he waited a long time to reply—have run into the
library, and looked up some line with SPEs in it? This event convinces
us that Catholic Emancipation ought not to have been granted. |
Friday. LoRD Monck, of Ballytrammon (what a good name), late
Governor-General of the Dominion of Canada, called attention to the
state of the Army, which he did not think at all adequate to our require-
ments. The Under-Secretary for War, Lord North BRook, thought
better of it, but announced various improvements. The DUKE of
CAMBRIDGE hoped that there would be no destruction of the present
system until another should have been tested. ...Our GeoRGE's speech
was very sensible, but in manner a beautiful illustration of the way
veterans hammer the same allegation into you a dozen times consecu-
tively. LoRD TRURO most properly urged the Government to look
after the Volunteers.
Irish Church again. Amendments intended to improve the carnal
prosperity of the deposed Church—all defeated. The docile way in
which both sides obey their leaders is lovely. Only a few of the chiefs
really understand the details of the Bill. If you suddenly asked one of
the rank and file on either side to explain the purport of the proposed
insertion for or against which he was going to vote, you would get an
answer much in the style of Joseph Surface, when the screen has fallen.
But the faithful followers never go into wrong lobbies.
“They know this truth, enough for them to know,
DISRAELI walks out this way—that way Lowe.”

HINTS FOR CONVERSATION.
AY - DAY | Instead of asking
BLANCHE and AUGUSTA whether
they went out shopping this morn:
ing, or for a ride in the “Row,”
or a walk along the charming new
landscape garden in the Park,
inquire of them whether they got
up early, and went a-Maying with
their young companions of the
upper classes in the Willesden
lanes, and had a May Meeting
with Jack-in-the-Green and the
chimney-sweepers of the vicinity in
holiday costume; and what spoil
of scented hawthorn blossom and
wild flowers they brought home
to the family mansion in Upper
Grandison Street; and how they enjoyed dancing the cotillon round
the Maypole in the Strand, reared at daybreak by the Metropolitan
Police in the presence of the Loºp MAYor and Sheriffs; and whether
they did not find May-dew, applied as a wash to the complexion, a
wholesome and sufficient cosmetic; and who, after a ballot, was elected
“Queen of the May;” and what objection they see to giving up the
Qpera, for this one night, and going, in sedan-chairs and chariots
lighted by link-boys, to any hill conveniently situated they may choose
to select, Mount Primrose, or Ben Haverstock, or the Peak of Stam-
ford, or, perhaps, the more sylvan Denmark, there to kindle, with
BRYANT AND MAY’s matches, blazing fires, in revival of the ancient
Keltic (spell it with a “K”) heathen festival known as “Beltein,” and
fully detailed in the works of that luminous historian, IGNIss PHATUous?
BLANCHE and AUGUSTA may not be able to report that they have
performed any of these rites and ceremonies, and may elect to go to
Milliam Tell, or MRs. CLIFTON CLEVELAND’s dance, in “green light-of-
day fulle,” in preference to rambling on, Herne or Notting Hill; but
!. will have had the opportunity of displaying your antiquarian know-
ledge, to which, when you brush against the chimney-sweepers, you can
impart a more modern turn by references to MRs. Montagu, and the
who was lost
and
the dinner she used to give to the London sooties on the first of
May, and the sweet voices of the Oxford choristers singing their
morning carol on fair Magdalen tower; concluding with a classical
allusion to the Roman “Floralia,” held in ancient times at this period
of the year under the patronage of the resident nobility, clergy, and
gentry, which you will translate into Flower Games, or Flower Shows,
and so adroitly bring your fair and dark hearers back home to the
Regent's Park and South Kensington Gardens, where, by a happy con-
spiracy, you all met to see the spring flowers, sat under the Upas Tree
(which, from its supposed fatal power of causing the death of every
person who came near it, ought to have been called the You Won't pass
Tree), admired the new voluptuous blossoming shrub from the Cordilleras
—Hookeria Scrumtiosissima—and noted the last novelty in parasols.
Ask that Irish archdeacon, peeling an orange, who is recruiting his
health in furnished apartments in Piccadilly after the exhausting duties
of his sequestered parish (Protestant population 26, emoluments £446,
ood substantial house, and some glebe), what the “Kentish Fire’
is which of late has been rather extensively consumed in public meet-
ings and assemblies where MR. GLADstoNE is not idolised—whether a
sort of Protestant firework (wholly different from Roman candles)
dangerous when entrusted to firebrands, and of a highly inflammable
character; and talk to him nicely about Maynooth, and the Pope and
the Jubilee he has been celebrating, and ARchbishop MANNING, and
his own prospects in the Archidiaconal future, until you have made
him comfortable and happy for the rest of the evening. -
As you are personally interested in the matter, being on the point of
marriage with a lady who is one of six daughters, get, if you can, at
the views of MR. Loftus H. SMALLEY, the Member for New Sagent,
on the Deceased Wife's Sister and Deceased Husband's Brother
Question; or, if you are a lawyer, ascertain whether he inclines to
Carey Street or leans to Howard Street; or startle the timid lady you
took down to dinner, in a shy-coloured silk (there is a new novel worth
reading—In Silk Attire, and HENRIETTA ANNESLey is advising every-
body to make the acquaintance of her namesake, Hetty, in Qnce a heek),
by asking her if she has seen the article in one of the scientific periodicals
on “The Lion in Britain,” which great “carnivore” she has hitherto
hoped was confined to the Zoological Gardens, where you can recom-
mend generally all who have a taste for the ferocious to go and see the
.# Wild Cat; or condole with the company round on the possi-
ility of the revival of the great Convent, Case, which you forgot at
the time to say was a nonesuch; or, finally, having reserved it as a
bonne bouche, thinking the subject one certain to arouse universal
interest, set yourself to elicit the opinions of all at the social board on
—the Bulgarian question.

rophesy any ill to the child. She only said in confidence to LADY
opo, “NELLY WEASEL will want me one of these days. I know her.
I am told SIR GUY is very devout, and is giving up all balls and par-
She is not made for a dull life. They tell me LoRD Moth has
LADY LYNX—HER MANAGEMENT—MR. RABYT-MISS GUINEA PIGG– been staying at Holecastle lately.”
MISS WEASEL–SIR GUY FOX—SERGEANT TURKEY.
Oln BARNDoor, the Jolly Old Cock, was there, hearty and honest
as ever. Goosey was somewhat troubled in his mind as to what his
lº. reception of him would be, seeing that, on their last parting,
e -
, Goosey, had, so to speak, been kicked out of doors. To see Old
fºr spoon salute his son in his heartiest manner, was, as LADY LYNX
observed, really quite touching; and then how courteous and pleasant
he was with Miss IDA DRAKE, in whom he had then no idea that he
was welcoming a future daughter-in-law. But LADY LYNX saw it all,
knew it all, every bit of it, better than we did, who were, to a certain
extent, in the secret.
LADY LYNX having disposed of her own encumbrances to advan-
tage, undertakes matrimonial speculations for friends, as it were, on
commission. No one who knows her Ladyship would urge, for a
moment, that marriages are made in Heaven; unless he were inclined
to flattery, when an explanatory addition could be made to this effect:
“Or in your Ladyship's drawing-room, which is the same thing.”
such •º were a thoroughly recognised business, then on
LADY LYNX's cards would be inscribed, “Matrimonial Promoter.
Managing Directress of the Holy Alliance Company. Unlimited.”
How many excellent matches has not this enterprising woman made!
Of how much misery has she not been the cause !
Miseryl Bah! That’s their affair: not hers. She brings them
together. She introduces Mister RABYT to Miss GUINEA Pigg, the
Scotch heiress, gauche and gawky, with red hair and an irritable nose;
she brings them together, throws them together, leaves them together,
drops hints of RABYT's passion for Miss Pigg, and regrets that she
(LADY LYNX) having been made the confidante of RABYT's secret,
cannot betray him to her: though— And here she will break off and
exclaim that she wonders how some people can be so blind. Then she
gives Miss Pigg a little smart kiss on the forehead, and two little
good-natured §: with her fan on her arm, just as the servant enters
announcing “ RAbyt.”
“How curious are these coincidences ! We were only this moment
speaking of you.” And here my Lady casts a significant glance at
MR. RABYT, who utterly fails in an attempt to appear at his ease; while
Miss PIGG, in shaking hands with the visitor, can hardly trust herself
to throw her large eyes up at him, lest he should then and there go
down on his knees on one of the large flowers in the pattern of the
carpet, and make an impassioned declaration.
lf MR. RABYT, aged twenty-two and with plenty of money (“Mone
clings to money,” says LADY LYNX) is led to propose to the §.
heiress with a Jamaican fortune, well, they deliver themselves to each
other of their own will, by their own act and deed. Cupid lights a
hymeneal torch, and, being a universal lamplighter, has to run off,
ladder and all, to the next post, and thence to the next street. If
there’s a poor supply of oil, out goes the lamp. It is hard to blame
LADY LYNX in such instances: yet they do. The parties themselves
blame her, and wish they’d never entered the Dowager's drawing-
room, or been placed under her chaperonage.
She knows this—no one better. “But, my dear,” she says, quietly
nodding her head, “they come to me in their difficulties.” And,
assuredly, many a domestic rent has this invaluable woman patched up.
Aristocratic clothes-carts, with baskets crammed full of dirty linen, are
driven up to the Lynx laundry, where the washing and cleaning is
carried on with the greatest possible secresy.
When LADY LYNX chats with you (she is delightfully chatty), she
merely indicates her knowledge of a scandal here and there, as baits to
draw you out, and discover what you may know about the affair, what-
ever it is. She took up Miss WEASEL, a very wide-awake young lady,
without a fraction of a consol in her possession, and married her to
SIR. Guy Fox, the Catholic baronet, of ancient lineage, with one of the
finest estates in England, which he had some idea of giving up to his
brother and entering into the ecclesiastical state, had it not been that
while he was debating the subject with himself, he paid a visit to his
cousin, LoRD ST. REYNARD's, where LADY LYNX came, bringing as her
companion Miss WEASEL, who, professing intense dissent from the
baronet's religious opinions, showed an under-current of inclination
towards being converted to the tenets of his faith. |
“Catch Miss WEASEL fast asleep,” said her Ladyship, playfully, to
º §. “and win a pair of gloves of her.” And the guileless baronet
id it too.
When Miss WEAs EL became LADY Fox, her kind friend, LADY
LYNx, “who had been a second mother to her,” (her first being in a
very humble sphere of life, and kept judiciously in the background,)
was always gushingly welcomed at Holecastle, SIR GUY’s seat, which
had been in the Fox family for centuries. But, after a time, a coldness
É. up between them, and when, in two years' time, little Guy was
orn, the Old Fairy didn't receive her invitation to the christening.
LADY Lynx could have pointed out to OLD BARNDoor the Little
Duck as his daughter-in-law, with the very time and place of the pro:
posal that evening, had it served her purpose to notice such small
Within a week the DoRMoUses, in whose family you may remember
Miss DRAKE was governess, knew all about it, and communicated with
the REv. M.R. DRAKE, her father, in the country. Then Goosey had
to go through the ordeal of a visit to the Jolly Old Cock, when that
amiable old gentleman told him that he was throwing himself away,
that he had expected, from the society in which, he had seen him, he
would have made a good match, and more to the same old purpose,
finishing by condemning himself, in a most Christian spirit, to a fate
worse than that of Hamlet's father's ghost, if he should ever allow one
sixpence to a son who was so blankedly ungrateful.
The fact was, he wanted all the sixpences which should in time have
come to Goosey, for his own present use and benefit; and what more
natural reason for his own justification in this matter could there be,
than the unfilial conduct of his son P For, as every one, who knew
OLD BARNDoor's parties and dinners, concluded, “There must be
something wrong in a lad who could behave badly to such a kind,
good, Jolly Old Cock as that.”
The above interview with the parent bird was, as I have said, a week
or more after this º at the MACAws, but it was here that he
politely yielded his place at the supper table to a *::: middle-aged
gentleman, with whom he fell into conversation, and to whom he was
subsequently introduced by MR. DoRMouse Senior, whem, to poor
Goosey's dismay, he found he had been discussing legal points with
the great SERJEANT TURREY himself, whose name as a Quarter
Sessional Judge, is a terror to prisoners, and whose presence is an
ornament to any bench of magistrates.

SISTERS-IN-LOVE v. SISTERS-IN-LAW.
“The announcement of the majority of 99 for Second Reading of the Bill
(for Legalising Marriage with a Deceased Wife's Sister) was followed by
rattling of fans, clapping of hands, and something very like cheering behind
the lattice of the ladies' cage.”—Parliamentary Report.
WHEN ToM CHAMBERs and BRIGHT, with unhallowed delight,
Broke the barriers 'twixt husband and sister-in-law,
Behind the cage bars, in lord Charles's" despite,
Fans rattled, sounds rose 'twixt “ hear, hear !” and “haw, haw ”
Were those earthly fans in live hands that so rattled P
Came that eldritch laugh from live feminine throats?
Or was’t bodiless spirits that giggled and prattled
Their delight in those speeches, their joy in those votes ?
Were they ghosts of dead wives, smart of old raws diverting
With the thought of this new matrimonial blister,<
Of a wife, with the mission at once of asserting
The rights of her sex, and the wrongs of her sister P
Were they ghosts of wives' sisters, who wed in their life-times
Cared neither for status nor statutes a straw ;
Now exulting in prospect of legalised wife-times,
For sisters-in-love who are sisters-in-law
Be those sounds from live women or spirits of dead ones,
Woman has made her voice heard in Parliament's halls;
And the gain of one mother-in-law for two dread ones,
Must be set 'gainst the chances of sisterly squalls.

THE CENTENARY OF NAPOLEON THE FIRST.
LETTER OF THE FRENCH EMPEROR.
(By TELEGRAPH.)
(From our Own Correspondent.)
PARIs, APRIL 27.
The Journal Officiel, only published very late this morning, contains the
following letter from the EMPEROR to M. Rouh EB :—
M. le Ministre+On the 15th of August next it will be a hundred
years since the EMPEROR NAPOLEoN was born,
This fact, M. le Ministre, is incontestible, if the major contains the
minor. My respected Uncle was born in 1768.
But, out of his adoration for France, he was pleased to advance the
date of his birth. He was a Corsican, and his native island did not
belong to us until he was a year old: Great and noble being, who
could thus sacrifice his swaddling, clothes on the altar of glory, and
make himself a Frenchman in defiance of Providence A lie, baptised
byB. is a holier . than a vulgar truth.
uring that long time plenty of ruins have been made, but the great
figure of NAPOLEoN has remained up-standing. It has been occa-
sionally removed from Arches of Triumph, columns, and the like, when
France foolishly and madly got weary of Napoleonism, but it has been
replaced, for the present. -
o celebrate what we will designate the centenary of the birth of the
man who called France the Great Nation because he developed in her
those masculine virtues upon which empires are founded, is to me a
sacred duty, in which the whole country will willingly assist.
For those cavillers who pretend that France was a Great Nation,
and was so called by Fº centuries before my respected and Cor-
sican Uncle was heard of, have no reply but disdain. That France
had valiant and meritorious Kings in old days it is impossible to deny,
seeing that the Revolution which brought ". ncle kicked their
skulls about the churches in which they had been laid by the piety of
Frenchmen. But who thinks of the stars of night when the dawning
sun breaks forth in splendour?
Others assert that my respected and Corsican Uncle was a Failure,
even in the single art which he understood, that of º: They
pretend that he was beaten out of Russia, beaten out of Egypt, beaten
out of Spain, whence a hook-nosed aristocrat had the insolence to follow
a flying French army into France itself. Finally, they affirm that he com-
pleted the list of his Failures at Waterloo, and that though his life was
contemptuously spared, he died in transportation. Such reminiscences
are abominable, and an abuse of memory, and I scorn to deal with
them. But to recall grand historical memories is to strengthen faith in
the future—to do *::::: to the memory of great men is to recognise
the most brilliant inanifestations of the Divine will.
I will not dwell upon my own superiority to my respected Uncle.
He was Emperor only from 1804 to 1815, with an interval, whereas I
have been Emperor from 1852 to 1869. Deus nobis hac otia fecit.
Let us hold a JUBILEE in honour of my Uncle's alleged birthday.
That it may be pleasant to everybody, let us increase our national
expenditure by several millions of francs. Let us not waste them,
however, upon the starving Schoolmasters of France (whose clamours
are offensive, and, who qught to console themselves in their penury
with noble and elevated thoughts of their sacred mission), but let us
give them to old soldiers who shared the defeats of my respected Uncle.
I deplore the fact that though Frenchmen affect to be as alive as ever
to a sense of the glory of France, and would be as prompt as ever to
rush to war were her honour attacked, they are stupidly blind to the
fact that there can be neither honour nor glory without Napoleonism.
They hiss the war-songs that delighted their fathers, they laugh in the
theatres at military sentiments that of old drove them to fever. Those
pestiferous journals preach peace, and goodwill, and commerce, and
dwell on the hatefulness of the conscription, which they say drags the
flower of our youth to a useless life, or a bloody death. . How can one
argue with such materialists, or kindle the true flame in their stony
bosoms ? Still, we will do what we ean. -
I hear, with disgust not easily clothed in words, that the objectionable

FOREIGN NOTES.
“The Cuckoo has ahready been heard in our neighbourhood, her welcome notes
bearing testimony to the extraordinary mildness of the season.”—Extract from Daily
Paper.

THE BEST POSSIBLE INSTRUCTOR.
OF course the Daily Telegraph knows all about it, when it tells us, apropos of
the execution of SHEwARD and the reprieve of WILTSHIRE,
“The sad fact is, that reprieves are mere chance-medley. . The Home Secretaries are
overwhelmed with work; they do the best they can, by the help of certain rough-and-
ready rules; until, after one or two exercises of clemency, the irresponsible balances which
they hold tilt up, at the touch of fancy or a dogged opinion, and the culprit who happens
then to “lie for execution’ ‘draws a blank' in the Home Office Lottery.”
Shallow people, who do not draw their opinions fresh and fresh from the lips of
our contemporary, might be apt to think that the HoME SECRETARY, who usually
combines the qualifications of lawyer and statesman, in exercising so solemn a
function as that of dispenser of the mercy which is one of the prerogatives of the
Crown, would be likely to act under a grave sense of responsibility—to weigh the
reasons which have to decide the momentous issue of life or death, carefully and
anxiously—to proceed, in short, in a way as unlike “chance-medley,” or the guid-
ance of “rough and ready rules” as can well be imagined.
The leading-article writer in the D. T. knows better. He has watched the
Home Office Secretarial Staff, Private, Parliamentary, and Permanent, at their
little game of tossing for “Life or Death,” like the group of street urchins at their
game of “Heads or Tails” in HogaRTH's picture of the Idle Apprentice. He
has seen Sportive Fancy, and Dogged Opinion,--like Sin, and H. at their
diceing, in the Ancient Mariner—tipping up the irresponsible balances kept in
Whitehall for weighing Guilt and Innocence. He has stood
by while the convicts, lying for execution” were dipping
into the Whitehall “lucky bag” for their chance of a
reprieve, like Cockneys round a Wheel of Fortune at
Ramsgate.
When one reflects on the probabilities of the case, by
the light of what, one knows of the station, education,
and, training of English statesmen, the feelings which are
likely to guide them, the influences they habitually act
under, and their liability to answer for their acts in the
House of Commons, as well as in foro conscientia, it is
impossible not to feel convinced that the D. T. is in the
right on this matter as on all others, and that we cannot
do better than accept its conclusions,—till we are forced to
correct them by the help of the HoME SECRETARY's straight-
forward answer to a plain question put to him in Parliament.

Whilst, touched, another hand it burns,
Who stretch and shorten him by turns
A foot and more above his stature,
As much below his height by nature;
Who make him do what MICHAEL Scott,
With all his gramarye, could not
Things which with wonder would exhaust us
More than the deeds of DR. FAUSTUs,
Facts if a Barrister-at-law
Did see, which facts he says he saw ;
And if those facts had a foundation
Outside of his imagination—
Now listen to an invocation:—
Say, Spirits of departed folk,
You can, or HowITT is a moke,
Lares, Penates, Lemures,
Qr Poltergeister—what you please—
Why did you to your Home prove lacking
In time of need ? Call you that backing
Your friends, to keep yourselves aloof
Just when their credit wants your proof ?
When Lyon versus Home was tried,
Why were you not at DANIEL's side?
You might have proved, by demonstration
In open Court, his “levitation.”
When Counsel him did cross-examine
You might have shown yourselves no sham, in
Whisking JAMEs, Q.C.'s ... off, or
The wig of the Vice-Chancellor.
And yet so much you did not, then,
As scribble with his Honour's pen.
Or even knock, with unseen blows,
Upon the desk beneath his nose.
Come now, will you a sign afford
To Punch, when at his festive board,
Your presence at that board revealing
By hoisting it unto the ceiling?
Nay, raise it but an inch or two-
To satisfy him that will do. .
What can you not, for his conviction,
Give him one rap? Your name is FICTION.

THE Seasons, we are often told, are changing and interfering with

A CREDIT TO CAMBRIDGE.
STUPIp indeed, one would think, must be that constituency which
sent to the House of Commons a representative capable of uttering the
internecine arguments which follow:—
“Much had been made of the expression in Leviticus that a man was not
allowed to marry the sister of his wife during the life of the latter, but many
eminent Hebrew scholars were of opinion that in this, and in a number of
other instances, the Hebrew word ‘sister’ merely meant woman.' It must
not, however, be forgotten that the Jewish system exhibited a rudimentary and
imperfect code of morality compared with º A system which
tolerated polygamy could not be regarded in the same light with the religion
of the Gospel.”
How, if the Hebrew word “sister” tin Leviticus merely meant
“woman” could the “Jewish system” tolerate polygamy any more
than pork? The reasoning which provokes this obvious question
occurs in a speech reported in the Times as that of MR. BEREspoRD
HoPE, who actually represents the University of Cambridge
“Hot-Water Apparatus for Heating Churches.”
WE have received a long list of testimonials to the merits of Messas.
BLANK & Co.'s contrivance for this purpose. But read the articles in
the Church-Union organs and the Record, and the speeches at the
Dublin Church Conference, and then say what can equal Ritualism
and Dis-establishment, as a “Hot-Water Apparatus i for Heating
Churches”?
PSYCHOLOGICAL.
The state of mind that man is in who risks largely in a lottery, and
does not draw a prize, may be described as Blank Despair.

REAL BENEVOLENCE.
FIELD-MARSHAL PUNCH HAviNG LEARNT, To His GREAT SURPRISE, THAT THERE were
HUNDREDs of BEAUTIFUL Pictures, BY ENGLISH ARTIsts, ExcLUDED THIs YEAR FROM THE
R.A. ExhibiTION FoR WANT of SPACE, of FERED to LEND THE GREATER PART of THE FRAME
OF HIS FULL-LENGTH PortRAIT, As THE Usual CURTAIN, PILLAR, INKSTAND, OPEN LETTER,
GLovEs, AND CocKED-HAT could BE seen IN sever AL other. WoRKS IN THE Room.
CHIGNONS AND CONFIRMATION.
YoUNG Ladies, your attention if you please to this appalling intelligence:—
“It is said that the Bishop of NEw JERSEY has refused to confirm young ladies adorning themselves
with borrowed tresses.”
The term “borrowed tresses” is an euphemistic phrase, which means in plainer language
hair that has been grown upon another head than the one which now is wearing it. Girls who
buy this borrowed º: for the *. of adornment, are like the jackdaw that went strutting
in the peacock's left-off plumes. They cheat the eye by seeming prettier and more comely—
awag would say more combly—than they naturally are; and a Bishop is quite justified in declining
to confirm them while they practise this deception, or else it might be hinted that they were con-
firmed offenders.
DISRAELIPS PARTY.
AIR-‘‘ Hans Breitmann gife a barty.”
DISRAELI made a party;
What right had they to frown,
If he did it on the principles
In Vivian Grey laid down?
If a tool to ope his oyster
In Toryism he saw,
And in the Tory peerage,
| A collective Carabas?
DISRAELI gave his party
Much pleasure # be bound,
When in PEEL he thrust his dagger,
And turned it round and ...; :
When he backed up LoRD GeoRGE BEN-
TINCK
In his figures and his facts;
Out of place, resisted reason;
In place, accepted facts.
DISRAELI used his party,
As his stepping-stone to place;
No more scruple in his conscience,
Than passion in his face;
And climbed, and still climbed higher,
And with hapdoodie fed,
Their follies whom he flattered,
And their foibles whom he led.
DISRAELI taught his party—
(And they were not slow to learn),
| There never yet was principle
But inside out 'twould turn.
That what’s a lie in Whig mouths
In Tory mouths is true:
And Household Suffrage always
Was a genuine Tory view.
DISRAELI led his party,
Two several times to power:
To raise the cost of ruling,
Its character to lower.
Now of ape and now of angel
The part so well did play,
As to perplex plain Tories,
And drive able ones away.
DISRAELI had a party–
Where is that party now?
Like sheep without a shepherd,
Queered where to turn or how.
Yearning for SALISBURY's courage,
Or PEEL's blunt sense of right;
Or following HARDy's banner,
Straight-forward—from the light.
COMFORT IN PARIS.
DEscRIBING a fashionable residence in
Paris, a New York Correspondent states
that the chief bed-room is “extremely com-
fortable,” having—
“In one corner a piano, on which old masters
are played for private enjoyment.”
Tastes differ, we all know, and what in
Paris is thought comfortable, in England
may be deemed to be exactly the reverse.
Fond as we are of music, we should never
dream of putting a piano in our bed-room.
Fancy the delight of being waked in these
light mornings about four o'clock, A.M., by
one's wife playing the old masters, for her
private enjoyment! Why, it would be actu-
ally worse than the Waits'
“Motley's your Only Wear.”
MR. MoTLEY is coming. America in the
person of REveRDy Johnson, has had enough
of dinners. MR. MoTLEY comes in for get-
ting her desserts.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 26. The Lords had what our old friend RABELAIS
would havé called a jolly little great debate. Well, we do not insist
upon its jollity, save that all rows are conversationally said to have that
quality. But it was little: also great. . Some Conservative Lords, and
one remarkable Lord who hath been in his time a Liberal, and some-
thing more, were minded, mark you, to make it clear unto the pro-
moters of the Irish Church Bill that the measure need not indulge
itself with any hopes of an affectionate reception up aloft. And before
dinner, º must have been eaten about nine o'clock, the amiable
intention had been carried out with a vigour worthy of a better
cause.
Firstly, did LoRDs LismorE, BATH, CAIRNs, and MALMESBURY
make strong, but not too strong reference to the Tipperary murders.
They insisted that Government ought to say whether Slwe mea-
sures were not to be adopted. This was all right.
deal less right (when LoRD GRANVILLE said that the Lord LIEUTENANT
of IRELAND had telegraphed to beg that the question might not be
ressed) to try to pin the Ministers to a date for giving information.
}. SPENCER is minding his business, and part of it is not to let the
assassins or their Fenian or priestly sympathisers know what he is
going to do. - -
But, the drama having begun with a dark scene, its tone was pre-
served. Nominally discussing LoRD CLANRICARDE's Bill, the #:
sition Lords endeavoured to show that the disaffected state of Ireland
was due to Anti-Church agitation, that Government had unsettled
opinion on the rights of property, that Irish land would become un-
marketable, and that the peasantry fully believed that MR GLADSTONE,
in return for election support, meant “to give them the land.” These
pleasing utterances were varied by quotations from MR. BRIGHT-
whom LoRD DUFFERIN cleverly defended, and from Ms. BRUCE, the
only drawback to the effectiveness of these second citations being the
trifling fact that the Home SECRETARY had never said the things
imputed to him. --- - -
UKE of ARGYLL, indignant, told the Opposition º that in
pretending to be impatient to settle the land question, they were
manifesting their hate for the Irish Church Bill. He was too angry
however, to enforce this palpable truth with effect, and the practised
s, amplified over him with some success.
But it was for floan Westaury’s speech that we all looked, and he
was serene and defiant. If the Government had a land scheme, we
ought to know something about it...Most important was the question
of fixity of tenure. Unless the Ministers had views thereon, they
ought not to have unsettled the question of ecclesiastical tenure. As
for the Church Bill, we had been told that we must accept or reject it.
just so. But was there not a third course? The pacification of Ireland
being the sole pretext on which such a measure was pressed, could we
not postpone it until we had the whole Pacification scheme before us?
Well asked, thought the º Lords, who began to discover
that the once dreadful LoRD WESTBURY, Bishops' Demon of the Privy
Council and annihilator of other demons, had much goodness and
wisdom in him. LoRD GRAN VILLE did not say what he thought, but
we shall hear at fitting time. He says he talks slip-slop, but nobody
talks better. - - -
LoRD CLANRICARDE, graciously assuming that Ministers had pro-
mised that their Land Bill should not be destructive of the rights of
property—this must be a great comfort to us all-postponed Committee
on his Bill till the 25th May.
In the Commons we went on, undaunted, with the said Irish Church
Bill, and MR.DISRAELI (recovered) made a smart speech, in which he set
forth that the gracious and generous Bill which had been promised in
the autumn had been made a sweeping and severe one. The PREMIER
replied that it was as G. and G. as it could be, but such a measure
must also be S. and S. But he assented to some minor amendments
suggested by MR. DISRAELI.
Then we had a goodish fight. The Government had proposed that
Twelve Irish Churches—we mean actual edifices—should be preserved
as national monuments, and that, the Future Church—we mean
EccLESIA—should be paid to keep them up. But it is thought that
this is a sort of homage to the Protestant Church, so the clause was
struck out. Did not certain Protestants rage, and declare that this
was a concession to the Papists, made at the command of CARDINAL
CULLEN ? However, majority 100 settled that matter.
Then there was a Glebe Houses wrangle, in the course of which
SIR HERVEY BRUCE politely observed that the observations of MR.
GLADSTONE were disingenuous, even for him. Of course he apologised
on demand, but scarcely mended the affair by saying that he really did
not know in what words to express his meaning.

Tuesday. The Lords read a Second Time, and without a division,
EARL RUssell's Bill for .." QUEEN to make Life Peers.
LoRD DERBY, however, signified that Peers ought to be men of great
estate, and that it should be expounded in the patents of the new class
that they accepted such a rank because they had not the means of

founding a family. EARL RUSSELL, in defending his Bill, said that
John Locke would have made a good peer, and that JoHN MILTON
was equal in business talents to LoRD MALMESBURY, with the addi:

to consider the process of making Scotch and Irish Representative
Peers... And in the course of the debate the DUKE OF BuccLEUGH
“repelled with scorn and indignation” an imputation that had not been

| Took his seat in the Commons LoRD HYDE (son of LoRD CLAREN-
|DoN) the new Member for Brecon. Ha! Punch has mentioned this
young noble before, but it was a very long time back, and when he was
a very young noble. One who singeth no more sang the wail of a
|lowing footman in the service of Lord CLAR'NDON, then leaving Ireland,
|and taking with him his family and maidens—
“And little LoRD HYDE, and the Chewtor,
And what will I do
Without you,
O MEARY, with eyes of the blue.”
. MR, LAYARD re-stated MR. Lowe's plan for the New Palace of Jus-
tice, the Home of Themis, or whatever else we are to call it. Govern-
ment resolves that it shall not be on the Carey Street site, and shall be
on the Howard Street site. All the judges, except one who had not
been consulted, were stated to approve the change.
. The young Minister, MR. THEVELY AN, won his spurs by a speech
introducing a Bill for the reform of Greenwich Hospital. All the old
salts are to be sent away with pensions to be spent where they like,
except those who require the shelter of an infirmary, and these are to
be sent to Haslar and elsewhere. The present infirmary is to be given
to the Pºlº hospital. Government has not made up its mind
what to do with INIGo Jones's grand building. The merchant seamen
who have contributed their sixpences for ten years are to have £4000
a-year among them—they have long complained of being wronged, and
have been answered that the fleet protected the navigation by which
they lived. This shows the advantage of going on grumbling.
Seotch game seems a grievance, but landlords can get such enormous
rents from rich Englishmen who like sporting, that the tenants have not
been listened to. However, something is to be done now. While the
legislation is on, could not a clause be put in for hanging the man who
murders an ? How could SIR EDwiN have painted that picture,
if all the eagles had been murdered, as they will be a precious time
before we have another LANDSEER P
A most particularly objectionable debate was raised by MR. NEw-
DEGATE over the alleged confession of O'FARRELL, the Fenian who
sought to slay the DUKE of EDINBURGH. Ministers very properly
refused to make the House a party to publishing such ribald trash.
And a Bill for dealing with the abominable Beershops, which demoralise
more clowns than can be counted, made progress.
Wednesday. A Bill for improving the method of taking Evidence in
the Divorce Courts was read a Second Time, on MR. DENMAN's motion.
LoRD PENZANCE approves it, which is one thing in its favour, and
another is that it is a further step towards getting rid of the idiotic
rule of law, defended only by lawyers and therefore primó facie wrong,
which prevents a Judge from asking for information from the very
person who best knows the facts.
Thursday. Another and another Irish murder. The desire of Members
to know that the Government is doing something, cannot be blamed.
The Irish Secretary stated that the executive would proceed with the
utmost vigour, but deprecated the entering into details. There is a
Ruffian called the Mayor of Cork, who has presided at a dinner to two
of the released Fenian convicts, and who eulogised O’FARRELL, who
wounded the DUKE of EDINBURGH. M.R. GLADSTONE said that the
fellow's language could not be too severely condemned. Is there no
loyal and strong-armed Catholic, gentleman in Cork, who will take a
hunting-whip, and handle this Mayor as the Greeks handled Sos-
Thºsts—while GALLIo smiled ”
Irish Church Bill all night. Government insisted that the Glebe
Houses should be paid for..., M.R. MooRE, a zealous Catholic, was for
giving them up freely to the Protestant clergy, but MR. O’REILLY,
understood to speak for the Catholic hierarchy, would not assent to
this. Majority for MR. GLADSTONE, 91. Then, after an interesting
historical speech from MR. Dish AELI, who desired that the date of the
rivate endowments, to be retained by the Church, should be put back
rom 1660, “to the Flood” said M.R. GLADstoNE, “to 1560’” said
MR.HARDy, a majority of S6 supported the Government date. Prac-
tically, the Church will not lose much by the decision—the diverting
thing is to see a theologico-historical era settled off-hand by an assembly
a fraction of whom probably may know the difference between an
Usher who was an Archbishop and the Usher of the Black Rod. MR.
CHAPLIN, hitherto chiefly known on the turf, made an excellent maiden
speech (on the Opposition side), on which he was gracefully congratu-
lated by the PREMIER, whose praise is worth having.

lying on his bed after he had made it, would be immediately dismissed.

A good deal of careful and judicious dressing is required morning

PENCILS AND PENKNIVES.
THERE are other topics, besides the Irish Church engaging the
anxious attention of the Cabinet. Curates, and organists, and pew-
º are not the only persons whose wrongs wring the hearts of
er Majesty's Ministers. The entire Civil Service will rejoice to
hear (according to the Pall Mall Gazette) that—
“The great “Penknife question' has been set at rest by the cancelling of
the order that no more penknives should be issued. The matter was, we
hear, carefully considered by the Cabinet.”
How true it is that the greatest minds can attend to the smallest
trifles! But we should like to know more particulars. Was there a
sharp discussion on the subject, full of personal, not to say pointed,
allusions? Did the Secretaries of State preserve, their temper,
or did they cut the Chancellors, and proclaim war to the knife against
the Presidents? Will the indulgence thus ted to the Government
Officials—who were all, it is rumoured, on the edge of rebellion,-end
with penknives; and must pencils, which, we believe, were also
included in the original ukase, be in future provided by struggling
clerks with large families at their own expense? If so, let those who
were foremost in restoring the public penknife, now take the lead in
iving back the State pencil; and let Ministers cede a point which is
fl. to prove a sore one if not instantly yielded. Cut down our
pencils! That would be too sharp practice.
THE FLOUR OF LovELINEss?—Pearl Powder.

ANOTHER • STORY OF ELIZABETH.”
HUNGER is the best of cooks, said one of old. He was not altogether
wise. The work of the best of cooks is lost on, a ravenous man.
But gentle hunger, which we call appetite, is delightful. Natural, it
is best. It is good when gained by “brown exercise.” It is not to
be despised when helped on by sherry-and-bitters. It is even welcome
when invited by bark. All agree that there is nothing so pleasant as a
reasonable hunger.
Yes. But there is one thing highly expedient. That is, the having
wherewithal to iſy this reasonable hunger. But why introduce
such a common-place We all—all who are worth thinking about—
have all we need; and as for the paupers, how many millions do we not

always disturbing our satisfaction with existing arrangements. Just
as we smooth ourselves down to a comfortable cigar and a glance at |h
the criticism on the last play, which (the criticism) is not so bad, we
come on a pestilent bit like this. A coroner has to view what is left of
ELIZABETH WILSON, milliner, of Chelsea, aged 35. Having been far
gone in consumption, she could not do much work, and a quarter's
rent being just due, her landlord distrains, much sooner than usual,
being a wise landlord, who knows that consumption may be rapid.
However, she paid him £2 10s., but there was £5 owing. Broker left
in possession. She could have crawled from bed to do a little work,
but was not allowed to use her ºfº..."; injure it, per-
haps, and so diminish its value to the landlord., Clergyman comes,
seeks a Relief agent, and a sovereign is paid, that she may use machine.
Agent comes again a day or two later, and landlord has swept all away,
and consumption lies on a bag of rags in a corner. Agent (a good man,
MR. DAwes) sends her a bed and food. But ElizaBETH WILSON
insists on dying.
These things will happen, and Punch would hardly have intruded
the story on polite readers, but that it bears upon his opening remarks.
ELIZABETH told the clergyman—
|
“That, being an out-patient of the Hospital for Consumption, she had plen
of physic, but that she dared not take it always, as it her hungry, whic
she could not afford to be.”
Pray take notice, Mr. Punch is not blaming anybody. He never
blames anybody. Things go in averages, and there must be an average
of murder, fire, starvation, every year, to be duly tabulated, and argued

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
AT THE OPERA; FOR IL FLAUTO MAGICO.
In the Stalls.
Elderly Gentleman (from the suburbs, who has brought his youthful
nephew, aged fourteen, by way { educating him musically, looks at his
watch). Ah, I thought we should be too early. (Looks about and sees a
slight sprinkling of people.) It won’t begin for a quarter of an hour.
Youthful Nephew (who would have come half an hour before if he could);
Oh, that’s jolly, Uncle. (Enthusiastically.) We shall hear the tuning !!
(Elderly Gentleman meditates, and Nephew eramines the programme, after
which an idea strikes him.) I say, Uncle, I should like to have a book–
they’re selling books.
ncle (foreseeing also that between the Acts there are refreshments).
Oh, you don’t want a book of this. (Nephew disappointed—Uncle
relents.) Well, you can go and get a book.
[Furnishes him with half-a-crown. After a short interview with the
Stall-keeper, Nepheio returns, and ocercoming a natural inclina-
tion to keep the change for himself, tenders it to his relative.
Uncle (generously). Put it in your pocket. -
[Feels the satisfaction consequent on an act of disinterested kindness,
and considers the future refreshment question disposed of.
Enter Two Ladies, escorted by a Military-looking Gentleman, who pass
orer Élderly Uncle's toes to their staff. Military-looking Gentleman
following, holding his hat high up in the air, as if he’d been petrified
in the act of cheering a speech. Ladies settle themselves in their seats.
Vague Gentleman (of military appearance, in difficulties with his hat).
Very odd I can’t get this—

Habitué (kindly). No : ARDITI.
Wague Man. Oh, yes; ha, ha! (laughs as if at his own absurd mis-
take. To Ladies) I meant ARDITI. Costa, you know, used to be—I
mean at the old House.
[Becomes mystified, as it suddenly occurs to him that Covent Garden
was burnt down, and so was Her Majesty's, in which case where
was Costa? Before he can arrange his thoughts on this subject,
Orerture commences.)
Habitué (to his Friend). Charming overture.
Friend (who doesn't like being instructed). Yes—know it well.
[Tum tum tums with his fingers on his opera-hat, as if checking the
orchestra's performance.
Wicacious Lady (between two other young married Ladies, attended by a
Middle-aged Gentleman in a fourth stall; they are earnestly and audibly
conversing during Ocerture). Yes, I told Mamma that WILLIAM couldn’t
get a place for him; but you know MRs. BROMFIT will always say such
unkind things of everybody, and so we settled not to do it.
2nd Lady (much intrºd). It is so like her.
3rd Lady (equally interested). And wasn't it, after all?
2nd Lady (ecidently feeling herself of some importance). No. But

Near-sighted Man (confusedly, to nobody in particular). Beg pardon.
[Is seen to feel for his eye-glasses, which he has evidently left
behind him. Peration of Near-sighted Man. Tries another row,
and inspects corner stall to find his number—discovers some one
in corner-stall, apologises, asks for his number.
Sucell (in corner-stall, annoyed) Number-aw—'pon my soul, I—there
it is at the back.
[Leans a little forward so as to let Near-sighted Man read it on the
back of the stall.
Near-sighted Man (politely). Thank you. (Wonders where the deuce
the number is, but not liking to inconvenience Swell any further, appears
satisfied.) Thank you, yes-much obliged. [Retires, puzzled.
Strell (to Friend) Wants to take my number, like a cabman.

at different dinner-parties, with a preface of “What I said to a
fellar, who,” &c.
His Friend (an amateur musician). , Yes: here’s the tenor song.
(Tenor sings. Friend shrugs his shoulders, and intimates by expressive
pantomime that he is suffering tortures, then says audibly.) Oh, dreadful
LDraws in his breath and compresses his lips, as if preparing himself
to bear the worst heroically.
Nephew (to Uncle). What’s he singing about?
Uncle (to Nephew). You’ve got it in your book.
[Nephew, collapses. Near-sighted Man having hit upon the happy
erpedient of getting the Stall-keeper to see him to his seat, is now
installed, and is attempting to follow the Opera from a book,
tehich he has brought with him from home. He keeps his eyes
close to the page, and rubs erery line with his nose.
Near-sighted Man (to himself). Wonder where they’ve got now?
(Turns orer tico pºges, and tries to catch up the Tenor in the middle of his
song.) No–it’s– (Looks off his book, and tries to see what is going on
on the stage. To his eye, the Tenor looks like a blurred photograph.)
Eh? Ah Is there anybody else on the stage P (Mores his head
about from one side to the other, scrutinising the stage.) No. (Is satis-
fied.) It’s a solo. (Looks for a solo song in his book. By the time he
has fired this, other songs have come on, a quartette has been sung, and
% we have SANTLEY as Papageno, making the niggers dance with his
ells.)
Near-sighted Man (inspecting the book closely, and referring to the
stage.) I can’t make it out at all. It's—ah— (Thinks he’s got some

his glasses behind.

Pague Gentleman. Well, it’s not easy to follow. You see, there’s a
princess and a black man, who—he is in love with her—and the—

THE BUNS AND THE BEASTS.
CAN anybody tell us why the buns at the Zoological Gardens seem
of them expressly constructed for the beasts?, There are bears
among the visitors and bores too, we dare say, not to mention that
wild donkeys upon fashionable afternoons are pretty frequently seen
herding there. For such animals as these the buns and other eatables
provided may be good enough; but when any nobler creature of the
genus homo hungers there, he finds it difficult to ſeed on such inferior
food. A walk about the #.". is an º exercise, and after
seeing the birds fed, one often feels inclined to peck a bit oneself. But
to stuff oneself with stale buns is an insult to one's dinner, and till

THE LEGITIMATE DRAMA.—Colm AN’s “Heir-at-Law.”
AN ILLUSTRATED ARCHIBISHOP.
THE Illustrated News recently contained a leading article in which
the writer commented with severity on the alleged language of ARch-
Bishop, MANNING to a Fenian, deputation. §: MANNING replied,
through his solicitors, denying the accuracy of portions of the report
on which the censure had been based. He also favoured the Wews
with his opinion that in misrepresenting the Archbishop it did not
promote loyalty on the part of that large proportion of the population
that look to him for advice. But the Illustrated News, remembering, we
suppose, that a much larger proportion of the population look to it for
advice, rejoined by withdrawing any remark based upon an imperfect
report, and then retaliated thus:
“There are two kinds of imperfection. We have dealt with one. The other
we regret that the Archbishop does not enable us to deal with as agreeably.
Minor details are corrected, but nothing is said in answer to the general
purport of our article, which went to show that the Archbishop separated
political from other offences, expressed a sympathy for convicted felons, and
spoke of them pityingly, as ‘poor men," not as bad subjects and condemned
criminals. In return for counsel, which we receive in a perfectly friendly
spirit, we would suggest that the loyalty of that class advised by the Arch-
"...] might be largely stimulated if those who rule in the Catholic Church
would remember that something is due to the great British nation, and that
the work of conciliation, at which English statesmen are honestly labouring,
would be rendered easier by a few loyal, manly, and patriotic utterances on
the part of the Catholic hierarchy.”
Very sensible, and none the less effective for being very polite. . But
cai bono & Dares the Catholic hierarchy speak out in the way desired?
What would. CARDINAL CULLEN say, either from himself or from
41°54' N, 12°27' E. In old days Christian bishops helped Govern-
ments to suppress crime. If the districts in Ireland, with assas-
sination, were deprived by the Catholic spiritual authorities of religious
rites until the murderers were in gaol, we should hear no more o
“agrarian outrages.” The assassins in the late cases are, of course
.g.: whiskey in the cottages of an Affectionate People. in England
or Scotland they would have been hunted down and delivered over to
the law, for in England and Scotland religion means, among other
things, hatred of murderers.
DRY BONES THAT LIVE.
W. Russell has been convoying the PRINCE and PRINCEss of
WALEs over the scene of his old experiences in the Crimea. -
Captain Pen, who did such gallant, service for Captain Sword all
through that mighty siege, has drawn his weapon again, forwar against
a new and formidable enemy—the apathy that surrenders the monu-
ments of the gallant dead to the wasting hands of time andźthe
elements.
It seems that our cemeteries on the plateau which for so many
months was the home of so much, valour and so much suffering, are
falling rapidly to decay. We paid £13,000 for having them walled in
and put in order; but we had nobody to see how the money was spent,
and it seems to have been absorbed, as a good deal more money of
English tax-payers has been swallowed up in the same region, without
serving the purpose it was paid for; and so, in those seventy grave-
yards which dot the wild slopes of the Crimean plateau with their
white mementos, of courage quelled and endurance over-borne, the
stones are decaying, the weeds are springing. The star in stone is
chipped off one monument, the honoured names are illegible on others.
Everywhere there is decay and desolation, where England believes and
wishes there should be decency and order, and ...; which in
graves of the dead should testify to the love and reverence of the living.
The note of pain and protest over this dishonour of the resting-places
of our fallen, soldiers, comes well from WILLIAM Russell, the most
ſº and vivid chronicler of the deeds of those heroes while they
ved. Let England blush, and let MR. CARDwell look to it.

THE “DEPTFORD SPEC " AND THE “DERBY
SWEEP.”
SEVEN persons of fashionable exterior, who
ave the names of ALGERNoN DEUCEACE,
IRJohn PUNTER, CAPTAIN HORSLEY, THOMAs
Fitch, MontgomERY GREEN, St. LEGER
FLATHERs, and PLANTAGENET DE Boots, (the
two latter of quite boyish appearance) were
brought up at Bow Street charged with esta-
blishing and conducting sporting lotteries under
the name of the “ Derby Sweep,” the “Two
Thousand Guinea Sweep,” and similar titles.
MR. Poland, who appeared for the prose-
cution, put in various articles seized by the
police, including receipts for money paid to
the different defendants, and lists of the various
sweeps, which it was proved had been exhibited
at various clubs, mess-rooms, colleges, and even
in the rooms of some of the upper-form boys at
Eton and Harrow.
HoRACE PIGEON, a young man of distin-
guished but ..º. appearance, who was
brought up from Whitecross Street, said, I am
- a young man of good family, I fancy, and of
what is called a sporting turn, I suppose. I have expectations:
nothing else that I know of. Of course, I have debts. On the first
of April I was a member of the Mausoleum Club. I suppose it is what
would be called a fashionable club. Should say decidedly it is frequented
by gentlemen—rather. How could a snob get in, with a committee-
ballot? It is in St. James's Street. I saw one of the lists produced,
exhibited over the smoking-room fire-place at the Mausoleum. I went
in for a chance. I paid a sovereign for it. Can't say where I got
the sovereign—the Jews, I suppose. I have gone, in on four of the
lists produced, and paid my tips for them. I paid the money at the
Mausoleum to FITCH. I believe he is butler at the Mausoleum Club.
I paid it, in two other cases, to DEugeacE, and PunTER. They
*|† the Sweeps at the Isthmian in Piccadilly, and the Grosvenor
in Pall Mall. They are Clubs, too. I belonged to all three, and two
besides. ... I paid two sovereigns for my chance at the Isthmian, and
five at the Grosvenor. That was the highest sum I paid. got
receipts for the money I paid, of course.
Cross-eramined by SERJEANT WINKING for the defendants.-Had no
doubt the thing was all fair. Expected to collar the lot, if he drew
the first horse; and half, if he drew the second. Had heard of fellows
winning as much as £300 and £500 at the Mausoleum and the Gros-
venor. Had no doubt the thing had been going on for many years
F. As long as he had been about town, in fact. , Is down on his
uck, now, Had dropped, all he had, or is ever likely to have, and a
ood deal more, he should say, on the turf. Might have said he had
en “rooked:” might have said he would like to pay off DEUCEACE
and PUNTER. His friends have always been preaching to him it was
his duty to pay everybody off he owed anything to. Owed DEUcEACE
and PUNTER a “turn.” The Serjeant knew what that meant as well
as he (witness) did.
Similar evidence was given in the case of the other defendants. The
evidence against; FLATHERs and DE Boots, the one an Eton the other
a Harrow boy, was extracted with difficulty from two of their fellow
schoolboys of twelve and fourteen, whose smart, appearance, knowing
mode of giving their testimony, and coolness under the cross-examina-
tion of the learned Serjeant, created much amusement in Court.
SIR THQMAs HENRY said it was very deplorable to see persons in the
position of the defendants engaged in breaking the law. It was par-
ticularly melancholy to see mere lads, like FLATHERs and DE Boots,
showing such a familiarity with the worst features of the turf, and not
only concerned in these criminal practices, themselves, but tempting
their younger schoolfellows to join in violation of the law of the land.
He could not overlook such a flagrant infringement of the law on the
part of persons who ought to have set an example to those of humbler
station. He had lately committed six men, of a lower class it was true,
for the same offence. They, also, seemed to have conducted their
... Lucky Bag” and “Deptford Spec,” as they called their “Sweeps.”
fairly and with good faith to their subscribers. The law could not
recognise any distinction of classes. As he had felt it his duty to
ºmmit IEich MAN, FARRAH, and their agents and associates, in the
Lucky Bag” and “Deptford Spec" lotteries, he should feel it his
duty to commit the defendants for establishing and conducting the
Mausoleum, Isthmian, Grosvenor, and other “sweeps,” including the
Eton and Harrow ones. They might be tried at the same sessions of
the Central Criminal Court as LEICHMAN, FARRAH, and the Deptford
offenders. Indeed, he saw no reason why both batches of prisoners
shºuld not be included in the same indictment. .
The prisoners were committed for trial, bail being taken, in very
large amounts. The Court was crowded with a distinguished and
fashionable audience, who on several occasions manifested their sym-
pathy with the prisoners so º that the Magistrate threatened he
º have the Court cleared. There was quite a rush to tender bail;
d the bail—a famous sporting Marquis and his, “confederate’
and stable-adviser, a gallant Captain, all . well known at “the
Corner,” and wherever else sportingswells do congregate—having been
accepted, the prisoners left Bow Street in their carriages, amid the
cheers of the crowd assembled, as usual, to greet the departure of the
prison-van.

To that model of book-keepers, HIGGs; . -
And Directors up-stairs, thanked Heaven in their prayers,
For such a protection from prigs'
How little they thought, as the daily 'bus brought
That modest and iſ paid young man -
To his desk and his stool, each employé was his tool,
And that “tapping our main” was his plan;
That at High-‘‘Tide-end Place” he was going the pace,
Lighting up quite a Central Gas flare, -
That the clerk in the City, whom all used to pity,
Was the Teddington onnaire!
What’s the good of Directors, Accountants, Inspectors
'Gainst burglary what use to keep dogs
If you’re plundered by those you most trust as protectors,
And find those are wolves, you thought sheep-dogs?
If your great Millionnaires with their preaching and prayers
Had not first practised “cooking accounts,”
And so long 'scaped uncensured, would Higgses have ventured
On their smaller, yet swingeing, amounts?
A FRIENDLY ADMISSION.
SIR, APPRApo of the debate about a man's marrying his wife's
Sister, I see as how a noosepaper remarks that MR. BRIGHT-
“With a grand quod sem quod ubique, quod ab omnibus sentiment, in-
forms us that the &: #. always *imited the legality and propriety of
such marriages.”
My atention was attracted to this ere by seeing the word omnibus
which I’ve druw one of them wehicles for uppuds of 10 year, andf
takes a matral interest in most anything consarning 'em. Sir, I don't
see what a omnibus have to do with marrying your wife's sister, nor
have it I consider much in common with the Quakers, leastways its
precious seldom as a broad grin, I mean to say a broad brim, ever gets
outside one. But I’m puzzled how a Quaker or any other man can
have “admitted the legality” of what is now, and allways have been,
contrairy to the law, which hoping MR. BRIGHT will explain this here
discruppency, I remain, your most obedient, Thomas BLUNT.

highly seasoned relishes in which the flavours and spices of French cookery are
sometimes rather too predominant. The intervals between the acts are judiciously
short, and the piece is handsomely placed upon the stage. So in your theatrical

CAPTAIN SWORD AND LIEUTENANT PEN.
GREAT and little Britons are continually grumbling that theirs is the
most expensive Army in the world, but they rarely take the trouble of
inquiring why it is so, and in what manner the cost may be most
sensibly reduced. Soldiers, as a rule, are seldom fond of writing
letters; yet, according to the Times, it seems that Army correspondence
is one of the chief ways in which we are most wasteful of our military
means :-
“Military correspondence is absurdly large, and employs an army of clerks.
The whole system breaks down inevitably during a campaign. Can any one
give a valid reason for paying troops nominally a certain sum daily, and then
stopping a regular portion of the money for food and necessaries? There is
none, unless it be that no other means could be devised for employing so man
clerks. Why not say at once that the soldier is fed, clothed, and paid 6d. or
9d. a-day besides, as the case may be? About two-thirds of the paper work
would be saved by such an arrangement.”
Powder, shot, and pipeclay are considerable items in the outlay of
our Army, but these are probably exceeded by paper, pens, and ink.
Captain Sword requires such service from Lieutenant Pen as enhances
very greatly the cost of Private Crossbelt. Even in time of peace an
army of clerks is always kept on active service, and a paper war is
being continually waged. Moreover, says the Times,
“Many of the clerks in the War Office and other Government departments
are examined competitively, paid highly, and then set to add up rows of figures |f|
and copy letters, work which would be better and far more cheerfully per-
formed by non-commissioned officers at about one-fourth the cost, very often
indeed by copying machines.”
If this be so, competitive examinations for military clerkships should
be limited, for candidates, to mere copying machines. Why should
educated gentlemen be invited to compete, when, the work is quite
mechanical, and requires no mental skill? A clerk, who has, to copy
letters, and to add up rows of figures, need hardly be proficient in
Greek, Hebrew, trigonometry, dynamics, and High Dutch. Such
acquirements are both difficult and costly to attain, and ought not to
be wasted, in a service where, it seems, they serve no useful end, and
only put the country to considerable expense.
A Pious Memory in Paris.
ON the fifth of last week, according to intelligence from Paris:—
“This day being the anniversary of the death of Napoleon THE FIRST,
religious services were celebrated in the chapel of the Tuileries and at the
Hôtel des Invalides.”
Is there no Mosque in Paris? For aught that seems to be known,
the only persuasion which the Great Philanthropist and Truthteller
ever professed was the Mahometan.

THE FAL-LAL MONITOR FOR MAY.
SPECIFYING the various “Fashions for May,” Le Follet announces
that “Pamiers are still very much worn.” Are they? Then perhaps
the Parisian world of fashion, impelled by an instinct of self-apprecia-
tion, has taken to going on all-fours. If their much-worn paniers are
carried on their backs, perhaps the creatures may be considered to be
appropriately laden. 'But, according to recent intelligence from Paris,
there is a league of ladies in course of formation, under the title of
Réactionnaires élégantes, against the asinine absurdities of attire with
which they have hitherto submitted to be burdened by dictatorial
dressmakers.
Le Follet also notices a costume of shot foulard, but says nothing of
y shot sea-gull, serving for fanchon. . It does, however, particularise a
bird's-nest “formed of heath, moss, leaves, and miniature wild flowers,
such as blue-bells, daisies, forget-me-nots, and lilies of the valley, in the
midst of which is placed a very small humming-bird, as if in the act of
flying from the nest.”. The contempt for physical geography, exhibited
in this combination of the botany of Northern Europe with tropical
ornithology, is to use the milliners' own epithet, charming. ... .
Not only are ornithology and botany, but entomology likewise is
tributary to “Fashions for May.” Le Follet describes a head-dress,
named the “Diadème Marquise,” which has—
“At the side a bouquet of white daisies surmounted by a small gold butter-
y.”
The somewhat whimsical decoration of a butterfly in the diadem is
one which, if bonnets were still in vogue, might be replaced by the still
more significant emblem of “a bee in the bonnet.”
Tardy Irish Tories.
It is announced that a meeting of Conservative Irish Peers and
Members of Parliament, headed by Colonel TAYLOR, Wiscount
CRichton, LoRD CLAUD J. HAMILTON, and LORD A. E. HILL-TREvoR,
is to be held at the Carlton Club on Saturday next, at 4 P.M., to con-
sider the propriety of immediately forming “and bringing into working
order” a Conservative Registration Association for Ireland. Will not

PUNCHPS ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 3. Want of dinner prevented Mr. Punch from men-
tioning last week an odd little episode in the Irish Debate on Friday.
There was not much in it, but Parliamentary anecdotes are scarce,
and a good deal was, later, made out of the affair. LoRD CLAUD
HAMILTON (brother to the DUKE of ABERcoRN, late Lord-Lieutenant)
made a vehement, attack, upon the PRESIDENT of THE BOARD of
TRADE, charging him with having greatly contributed to Irish discon-
tent and disaffection. Inter alia, LoRD CLAUD quoted a letter of MR.
BRIGHT's, written three years ago, in which he said that “if Ireland
were a thousand miles away, justice would be done, or the landlords
would be exterminated by the vengeance of the people.”
MR. BRIGHT responded at considerable length, denied no charge,
said that there would be no peace in Ireland until the soil was much
more º in the hands of the people, and added that he had a plan
to propose for effecting this without jºi. to anybody. [And, ğ.
tlemen Landowners, it is only fair to MR. BRIGHT to recognise the fact
that he declares his interpretation of the word “injustice” to be the
same as yours, so you are not to suppose him a reformer of the type of
the French revolutionist, who, when a man had proved that his ances:
tors had possessed his estate for two hundred years, gave it to his riv
on the score of justice—the other side had had it long enough.]
Demanded MR. HARDY whether MR. BRIGHT were authorised to
announce the policy of Government in regard to land.
Somebody on the Treasury Bench answered “No.”
It was assumed that the speaker was the PREMIER, but the Star was
authorised to deny this. The mystery has been well kept. We divulge
it. The speaker was
Mr. Punch.
And what he meant was, not that MR. BRIGHT is not in accord with
the chiefs of his º but that nobody was authorised, at that time,
to announce anything.
So much for that matter. On Monday the Commons behaved like a
pack of great schoolboys. The PREMIER proposed rather short Whit-
suntide holidays. Whereat, say the reporters, half the House groaned,
and the other half howled. It would have served the idle fellows right
had the Head-Master at once declared that they should have no holi-
days at all, and morning sittings every day. But MR. GLADstoNE has
been a boy, and has a boy at Eton, and so he ſº said that
his decree was not written in letters of iron, and later, he extended the
vacation. What do they want holidays for now? There are no birds
to murder.
We went on with the Irish Church Bill, and a student of human
nature would have been interested, if not pleased, with the sweet sub-
missiveness of the Conservative Land-owners to the Sweeping and
Severe clause which makes them such a splendid present in the matter
of the Tithe Rent Charge. MR. FAwcETT did not like it, and explained
that it will have handed to the Irish landlords eight millions and a
half of sovereigns, at the end of fifty-two years, on the condition that
they devote it to the commutation of their charge. It was meant to
buy off their º to the Bill. MR. GLADstoNE tossed figures
about with exquisite skill, and so completely convinced the landlords
that it was a right thing for them to take the money, that, when
MR. FAwcETT divided, he got only 33. It was touching to behold such
humility and patriotism.
Tuesday. The Lords sent the Sea-Birds Bill through Committee, but
all took out a clause, making the possession of eggs penal, as collectors
and museums might be informed against. But, that our friend
MR. Du MAURIER's egg-swallowing. Frog has had his offence con-
doned, he would have had an interest in this question.
That Mayor of Cork, who eulogised the man that tried to shoot, the
DUKE of EDINBURGH has §§ t the Government down upon him:
To-day (morning sitting) the Irish Attorney-General announced a Bill
for knocking him off his chair. There will be a great deal too much
clatter over such a fellow, but it seems that a Bill is the only way to
get at him. He went to the Cork gaol, and let out prisoners. It was
a pity the gaoler did not bundle the buttermonger into a cell, and keep
him on bread and water until the cheek was taken out of him—Mr.
Punch would have guaranteed the official against consequences.
Irish Church in, and we came to Maynooth, on which a great
fight was expected. But the chief incident to-day was exchange of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
vituperation between MEssRs. New DEGATE and WHALLEY. The latter,
however, made a statement, that MR. GLADSTONE had pledged himself
to abolish Maynooth, which, of course, the PREMIER denied, and an
amendment of MR. WHALLEY’s, for preventing the College Trustees
from holding land, was rejected by 324 to 196. After some more pro-
gress, MR. GLADSTONE named the three Commissioners who are to
carry out the Bill. He could not have made a better choice. They
are LoRD Monck, who was Governor in Canada, and has seen a dis-
established Church get into work there: MR. JUSTICE LAWSON, an
eminent lawyer and a man of the world : and MR. GEORGE ALEXANDER
HAMILTON, a Protestant, a Conservative, one who has the confidence
of Irish churchmen, and disapproves of the Act he is to execute.
At night MR. HEADLAM proposed to do away with the Lighthouse
Tolls, but the Government could not afford, to listen to such a thing.
Incidentally, MR. BRIGHT said that the Trinity House managed its
work most admirably.
JWednesday. We went at the Buttermonger of Cork, whose name is
DANIEL O'Sullivan: , Everybody (except (MR. MAGUIRE) felt that
he ought to be demolished, but the Conservatives determined to have
an onslaught upon the Ministers, in House of Lords style. ...So MR:
DisBAELI gently mentioned that, his Government had dismissed
O'SULLIVAN from the county magistracy for seditious language, but
that since that time a “revolution ” had commenced in Ireland, gaols
had been opened, and a flood of traitors and assassins had been let
loose over . land. Therefore, MR. O'SULLIVAN might have thought
that his proſligate foolery would not be punished. ..MR. GLADSTONE,
in reply, took advantage of a contemptuous expression used, or worn,
by MR. DisrAELI in reference to the Irish Attorney-General, and made
indignant remonstrance hereon. The Opposition did not really resist
the Bill, and MR. BEREsford HoPE warmly supported it, but had a
fling at MR. DiskAELI (“Batavian grace” not forgotten) and *:::::
the Government not to mind musty constitutional precedents. MR.
SYNAN (Limerick) pleased the Assembly with an Irishism, mentioning
that Colon E, FRENch had had a seat for many years, and was likely,
ifºle lived as long, to retain it for the period of his natural life. The
house laughed Synanimously. He writes to say he meant “as long
more”—almost as pretty a phrase as the other.
Hypothec-. That, we presume, is enough.
Thursday. We know the beatitude touching him who expecteth
nothing, and therefore shall not be disappointed. We keep it in our
minds in all transactions of life, with men and assuredly with women.
But we had almost a kind of idea that if nothing particular prevented
it, there would be something like a glorious shindy on Maynooth. For
to hear the language which has been used on the subject since the
promulgation of the Church Bill, the furious menaces of Demonstra-
tors at St. James's Hall and elsewhere, one might believe that the
. of the Church were coming up for a sort of Protestant Arma-
€0101011.
g “One conflict more, the fiercest but the last,
When the old Dragon-Monarch of the air
His fiery pinion on the cloud shall cast,

There was, really, no fight at all. A couple of divisions certainly,
but who took them P Did the Conservative army march forth to the
fray, with banner, brand [no, they could not have BRAND, he's Liberal],
and bow P Did the leaders pour hot volleys into the bosom of the
Scarlet Lady ? Nay, verily. Hear the tame end of the Maynooth War.
SIR GEORGE JENKINson moved that the money for Maynooth should
not come out of the funds of the Irish Church. CoLoREL BARTTELOT
said M.R. GLADSTONE had promised it should not. MR. GLADstoNE
denied it, and almost said that any one who supposed the money would
come, from another source, must be an ass—at least crass. e pro-
tested against bigotry. Then the Scotch element came in, with some
clatter, but it was made clear that the Scotch Members, º had been
sent to support the Bill, would do so, and leave Episcopacy and Popery
to settle their own quarrel. SIR JAMEs ELPHINston E abused the
Ministry for leaguing themselves with CARDINAL CULLEN to rob the
Church. More clatter, and a speech from MR. BRIGHT, who complained
that the Opposition to the Maynooth clause proceeded from hostility
to the religion of the Irish people, which was probable enough, seeing
that the opponents are Protestants. But MR. DisrAELI said that Pro-
testants and Conservatives had endowed Maynooth. He thought the
new grant should be Imperial. MR. Fort Escue made a point by
reminding MR. DISRAELI that he had strenuously opposed the Maynooth
endowment. Then the Committee had had nearly enough of it, shouted
everybody, down, and rejected SIR GEORGE's Amendment by 318 to
192. Next, MR. AYTOUN moved another Amendment for paying life-
interests instead of a lump sum, and MR. GLADSTONE elaborately ex-
plained that this would not do—we forget why. MR. WHALLEY said
that he had been an unappreciated prophet, and soon afterwards the
Amendment was rejected by 305 to 198—majority 107, and the May-
nooth Clause was passed.
Friday. “What wilt thou do, renowned SALisbury,
Cai Bight a villain and a Murderer?”
quoted LoRD PUNCH (improving on SHAKSPEARE) as he saw his
brother nobleman arise, meaning mischief, which was also meant by a
number of other Peers, impatient for a fray. LoRD SALISBURY used
no unworthy language; on the contrary, he spoke of MR. BRIGHT
with respect and admiration. But, referring to the incident of Monday,
recorded above, the Marquis let fly at the Ministers, and demanded to
know whether they had a Land-policy, and what it was.
LoRD GRANVILLE is an excellent Manager of the House, and never
showed more tact than to-night. He told the Peers frankly, that MR.
BRIGHT had violated the usual reticence of a Minister, and had since
said to his colleagues that he was sorry to have omitted explanation
that he spoke for himself only. Then he distributed slight but stinging
cuts all about, and refused to make any revelations.
Peers CARNARyon, CAIRNs, CLANRICARDE, GREY, RICHMOND, all
fired shots, but they did no great harm; and when the Chanceſſion
quietly said “We quite see what all this means,” LoRD PUNCH could
not help shouting out, “Don’t us, my boy?” But it is due to himself
to say that he was so ashamed of fis rudeness, that he instantly left the
Ouse.
House of Commons sent all the rest of the Irish Church Bill through
Committee, and the last clause was passed amid Liberal shoutings.
Some amendments were urged, apparently for the sake of, filling up
the morning, sitting. They were of course rejected, and . may be
forgotten. The next stage—the Report—was fixed for the following
Thursday. The Commons thought that they had done enough for one
day, so, at the evening sitting, they were Counted Out, and Mr. Punch
has nothing to say in the way of rebuke. º have worked well at
this measure, according to their lights and their darknesses; and
Mr. Punch congratulates MR. WILL, GLADSTONE on having walked,
as DANTE says,
“Where WILL and Power do hold one only path.”
WHAT THE WALLS HEARD AT THE ACADEMY
DINNER.
REALLY the speeches at the Academy Dinner this year have been
most imperfectly reported. Luckily new walls have ears as well as old
ones, and the walls of No. 3, Burlington House were listening on
Saturday se’nnight, on Mr. Punch's behalf, and have forwarded him
for publication some unreported utterances of this year's dinner.
(From MR. GLADSTONE’s Speech.)
He was a free-trader in Art as in other things. He was as ready to
welcome foreign productions to our exhibition as º products to
our custom-house. But he thought, as Government had duties in the
one case, so the Academy had duties in the other. One of these duties
was so to manage the admission of foreign works of art, as not to ex-
clude meritorious works of English growth. Now he had noticed in this
Exhibition about sixty foreign pictures—some of great merit. But he
had heard, he was sorry to say, of more than sixty English pictures
also of great merit, sent back § the Council. Now, either the accepted
º: were occupying places to which the rejected English
ones had the first claim, or, supposing both only equally entitled to
exhibition, he for one would have been glad to see the walls more
closely covered y the admission of rejected pictures, equal in merit
in many cases, if he might trust to what he had seen himself and
heard from others, to three-fourths of those accepted. Of course he
did not include the works of Academicians. They could not fairly be
taken into calculation, in fixing the standard—either in “ º xx
or “in levelling down.” . Looking round those walls, he thought he
could see room enough for at least two hundred more pictures. He
did not suppose there could be more cases of harsh and unmerited rejec-
tion than that. Probably there were not nearly so many. But if there
were only fifty—if there were only twenty—if there were only ten—he
thought the Council who †". them must have a very heavyweight
upon their consciences. He would not attempt to paint the heart-
ache, the bitterness, the gnawing sense of wrong, nay, too often, the
blank wretchedness of despair, which these rejections might produce.
He did not insist upon these painful consequences of rejection in order
to wring the hearts of the Members . the Council, or Hanging
Committee, who might be listening to him. But he referred to them,
in order to impress upon the Academy the deep, +nay the painful, re-
sponsibility of the duty imposed upon them; all the deeper, all the
more painful, because those who came under their ſ: were practically
without appeal, and because it often happened that rejection meant
more than disappointment, it meant ruin, the loss not of the hopes
only, but too often of the comforts—nay, of the bare means of subsist-
ence for the year. That might not be a fair consideration to urge in
the case of unquestionably bad pictures, but it was a very sufficient
reason why the utmost care should be taken not to reject any picture
that was not unquestionably bad, having regard to the standard
adopted, as indicated by the accepted pictures. He hoped the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Academy would not be offended by these observations... But he was in
the habit of addressing another Assembly, of a more distinctly repre-
sentative character, the members of which were elected, not by their
brother members, but by outsiders. That Assembly, he was proud to
say, was in the habit of largely considering the interests of out-
siders. The poorer and more helpless those outsiders, the more
generous, as a rule, was the consideration of their interests. In fact
it was this consideration, which, in the Assemblage he referred to, had
mainly governed the course of Reform, and the whole º of legis-
lation. He felt it ought to be so, he trusted it would be so, in that
Parliament of Art, whose members he was addressing.
(From MR. LEIGHTON's Speech.)
He had returned thanks for the Volunteers, but he had lately been
serving in a corps that was not exactly a Volunteer one—he meant
the Hanging Committee. (A laugh.), There was a general impression
that it was not a #. thing, to be hung. He shared that impres-
sion. But, he could safely say it was a more unpleasant thing still to
hang. Still he would remind their distinguished guest who had spoken
on the subject, that the acceptance and rejection of pictures rested not
with the hangers, but with the Council. He had taken part in that
work too. For corroboration of his experience of it, he would appeal
to all his brother Academicians who had fulfilled the same most painful
duty. He begged to assure their Right Honourable guest that it was
not possible humanly to avoid injustice. Let him consider what was
involved. This year it was worse than ever: for there were one
thousand five hundred pictures, more than usual sent in, and no more
time, to judge them—nay, less, in fact, for the workmen were in the
building, and the work of the Council and hangers was necessarily
much interrupted. But here were more than four thousand pictures
to be judged in three days, from ten to six, with an interval of about
an hour. That gave twenty-one hours, or one thousand two hundred
and sixty minutes to do the work: or between three and four pictures
to a minute! Among the four thousand, of course, there were many
pictures that aroused a good deal of discussion, and had to be put to
the vote. He left his hearers to judge how much cool judgment or
deliberation was possible, under these circumstances. Of course there
were many pictures so direfully bad, and some so pre-eminently good,
their reception or acceptance was settled by acclamation—at a glance,
as it were. But the mass of pictures came within neither of these
categories. Great care and much time were often necessary to weigh
fairly the merits of a modest unpretending picture, which had occupied
unany months perhaps of thought and labour, but which might not have
been seen by any member of the Council till it was swept before them
in the rapid tide of pictures brought up for judgment. It might be in
a style the Council were unfamiliar with—perhaps of a class most of
them were ignorant of, or indifferent to. Landscape, for example. There
were only two or three º painters in the Academy. None of
them might be on the Council; What chance had a simple, natural,
unconspicuous, yet faithful and meritorious, landscape, of fair judg-
ment, under such circumstances P So far from wondering that some
good pictures were rejected, his wonder was that cases of hardship and
involuntary injustice were not far more numerous. Luckily, though
some of the Council might . drowsy, others desperate, while all of
course, grew fractious, they had, as a rule, a sense of duty among them,
and felt they were sitting as judges, and tried to do their best. But it
was physically impossible to get through the work properly, in the time
allotted to it. Luckily a good many pictures were seen before-hand in
the studios: and men had their friends and acquaintances, of course,
and looked after their pictures. And a good deal was done by outside
influence. There was a class of people it was impossible to refuse any-
thing to, if they really set their minds on it. But, with all these cor-
rectives, he had no doubt that cases of cruel injustice did occur, par-
ticularly to the works of unknown and modest men, who had no
friends on the Council, and no influential acquaintance outside it, or
who shrank from setting that sort of influence in motion on behalf of
their works. He, for one, was ready to confess all this, and to avow
his penitence for any unintentional wrong that º: have been done,
and to submit to any penance that could be imposed upon him—except
to serve again on the Hanging Committee. The truth was, the time
allowed for selection was too short. He would #: thrice as long to
the work. He would like five hangers instead of three, and he would
always have a landscape painter if not an architect, among them. He
would not have the fate of pictures decided at one glance, but would
leave time and opportunity for re-consideration, in all cases but those
of pictures so bad that they carried their fate in their faces. He did
not know whether a Council twice as numerous was not desirable,
and whether it might not be an advantage for them to act, in relays,
so as to relieve the strain of too long-continued attention. After some
hours of rapid picture-seeing, it became almost as difficult to distin-
guish good work from bad, as Port from Sherry after many hours of
wine-tasting. - - -
Again, it should be considered that this was their first year in the
new rooms. The Council really were all abroad. They did not even
know with any certainty, how many pictures could be hung. They
began, as might be seen, by hanging wide, and leaving a great deal
l
of upper wall, but they kept hanging closer and closer, as they got on,
till at last they hung almost as high and as close as in the Old É.
As it was, they had only hung about one hundred and fourteen more
pictures, he believed than last 3. : and this was exactly the extra
number sent by Academicians and Associates. Then, though there were
sixty foreign exhibitors, he was very sorry to say the catalogue of 1869
showed forty-two fewer names of English exhibitors than that of 1868.
Considering the large additional space at their command, he could not
say he thought this satisfactory. He hoped they would manage better
another year.
(From the PRESIDENT's Speech.)
They had been afraid of lowering their standard of excellence.
fact was, they could not afford to do it. The difficulty was to keep it
up, particularly if old Academicians—good old boys, he was well aware,
but regularly used up, would insist on sending pictures, as they often
did. He had done his best, for insiders and outsiders too—and he
thought, for his own part, the Council and the hangers had been too
sharp in a good many cases—he had seen them at work, and could only
say he was thankful his pictures hadn't to pass through their hands.
When people talked of “levelling up"—and he didn't object to the
phrase—he agreed with their distinguished guest, the First Lord of
the Treasury, that Academician’s work—a good deal of it, at least—
mustn't be taken into account in fixing the standard. Perhaps it
might be well to put a mark on a good many of the R.A.'s pictures to
show they weren't to be considered by the students in the “levelling
up” business. He wouldn’t say some of his own Portraits mightn't
be among the number—and º: his excellent friend, the Secretary,
wouldn't object to two or three of his being “spotted,” in the same
way. Of course they had sent their full number. They were under
the notion, there’d be lots of room this year. It seems there wasn't,
for he had heard even more º: about rejections, he thought,
than usual. He had no doubt there was reason enough for it. There
were a good many young fellows took to painting nowadays, who had
better have stuck to shoemaking or tailoring, or some other homest
trade: good fellows enough, he had no doubt, and clever, he dared say,
but with no connections, and no fortunes, and no manners; who
looked like guys, and could only live from hand to mouth, and were on
their beam-ends if they didn't sell their picture as soon as it was
painted. He pitied 'em; but he didn’t see how that sort of thing was
to be helped, if that sort of people insisted on coming into a gentle-
manly profession. He was told their schools were to be improved.
He understood they wanted iºnº, and he was glad it was
coming. There was another thing. The Academy had changed
its quarters. It meant to change its manners. . In future a politely-
worded note would be sent to those whose pictures were rejected,
informing them of the fact, and telling them when and where they
would have their pictures returned. Then there would be arrangements
for the orderly admission of applicants for rejected pictures at specified
times, and for returning their pictures without their having to wait
and hustle for them for hours—so that the bear-garden business of
last week would be avoided. It was too bad to have a row round their
place like that at the old Opera, pit-door on the Jenny Lind nights,
which he remembered. A civil notice would be sent to outsiders
exhibiting, of the day on which they would be admitted to varnish or
touch up their pictures. After all, the Academicians were gentlemen,
whatever the artists might be as a lot, and he thought they ought to set
an example to outsiders of good breeding and consideration. He was
glad to see they had got a decent refreshment-room. He was told it
was well managed: prices fair, and refreshments as good as they usually
were at such places—rather better, if anything. That was an improve-
ment. But there were the umbrellas. He was afraid improvement
was sadly wanted in that department. The two poor devils he had seen
at that work as he came through the hall, even at the private view yes-
terday, looked regularly baked-groggy he should have said—blown,
dead beat. They knew what he meant. . It was regular cruelty to
animals. And if that was so ſº what would it be on Nº.
all next week, and all through the season, in fact. They Qught really
to put on half-a-dozen fellows instead of two. They could afford it,
and he thought some clever fellow might invent a spring clip, or some-
thing of the kind, to put on the umbrellas, instead of those big tickets
with long strings that took such a deal of tying and untying. These
were small matters, perhaps, but after all they told on people's com-
forts. And he thought the President of the Academy should be like
an Elephant—he did not mean that he ought to have a trunk and tusks,
but that he ought to be able to paint a portrait, or to pick up a pin.
He had been picking up pins in Academy administration, and sticking
them into his brethren—that is, not exactly his brethren, for he was
President, and would allow no brother near the throne—he meant into
the other Members of the Academy. He thought they ought to march
with the times, whatever, some obstructive old fogies might say; and
he, for one, would be glad to march at their head. “Live and let
live” was his motto. . He might not be as good a painter as some who
had filled that chair, but he would yield to none of his Fº lil
the desire to deal kindly and justly with all, in or out of the Academy,
whom he had anything to do with. (Cheers.)

And South Secession's sword against North draw;
Rejoiced to think that chasm would never close,

Giving your rebels’vantage, for which boon
From your own act they would have had to wait,
So much if you unblushingly can state:

And that you had just cause to be irate,
Because a pirate cruiser, while it slept,
Out of a British port, the Alabama, crept.
Suppose all this. How spoke the People's voice
Your adversaries did they back or you?
Why, your War's issue hung upon their choice,

Would Englishmen his plan have helped him through.

Starved by your conflict, did they prove untrue;
Bearing dire loss with patience, they forbore

MR. GoLDw1N SMITH writes from Boston to MR. Potter, editor of

be thought of for the present, MR. SUMNER having aroused so bad a
feeling against England. He thinks there will be no rupture, but “is
repared for a turn of affairs which will oblige the English to leave the
tates.” Mr. Punch declines to prepare himself, at present, for any-
thing of the sort, and unless the two foremost nations of the world are
mad, he believes the re-publication of the “SUMNER's TALE,” by one
G. CHAUCER, would be as likely to produce war as the Munchause,
Manifesto of his friend CHARLEs, with whom, moreover, he means to
have a word shortly. However, as it is well to avoid the least mis-
understanding, between friends, Mr. Punch, himself has paid MR.

Mr. Punch is not quite sure whether he asks for Two hundred an
Fifty Millions, or Billions, and therefore has sent over the latter sum.
If there is a balance, MR.SUMNER can keep it for himself, or lay it out
in building a lunatic asylum, into which, if the quarrel should really
arise, the people of the mited States will do well to insert every public

HOW TO CHECK TRADE CHEATs.
VER ONNERD MR. PUNCH,
ń, You knows all the
swells in the litter airy

the cove who've been a
wisiting our cribs, which
he calls em criminal aunts,
as though they’d been his
own relations... I'd , be
grateful if you'd give him
a small piece of my mind,
and arst him what the
ſeapletire] he means by
coming the Paul Pry on
a lot of onest ers,
shoemakers and sich, as is
mostly out of work & finds
§N it ard to earn a living.
§ He'd took good care to

back, else he might have
got a bonneting & preshus
well he wanted it. I says
as its a shame for coves
to be exhibited as if they was wild beasts, & for crushers to be ired
to Fº the part of showmen. . How would you swells enjoy a
wisit from me and SLIMY SAM, which he’s a night-man by purſession,
supposing, we wosjist to drop in quite permixious some fine evening
at your Clubs, and wos to jine in conversation with you at . your
dinners? Preshus nice ewasive answers you'd be tipping us Ifancy,
if we arst you how you lived & if you’d paid your tailors, and how
much in a week you’d ever made by onest labour. Them's, the sort
of questions as you put to us poor kiddies, & expex a cheerful answer,
which I wishes you may git it. -
But aint there other criminal aunts as ought to be inspected? How
about your grocers, shops & your butchers, & your bakers, where
cheating goes on wholesale, & retail too, with customers, by using of
false weights & breaking the commandment by committing of adultera-
tion? If one could see behind the scenes, sich aunts would prove as
wicious as the wust of our relations. Why, see here what’s been said
of em by gents as have inspected em:—
“The inspectors of balances, weights, and measures think the only way of
lessening the numerous cases of deficient weights and measures in the parish is
by giving publicity to those persons on whom the fines are levied. ethink
the parish authorities ought to take the matter in hand, and be more strict.
. . A famous tea-merchant, on our last round, whom we had occasion to fine
(he having a 2 lb. weight 6 oz. deficient, and a 7 lb. weight 4 oz. deficient),
said he would sooner pay any amount than have his name published.”
I see a pictur once in Punch of Justice with a pair of scales in one
hand, and playing blind man's buff with a bandage, on her eyes; and
this is how she goes about inspecting Weights and Measures. Precious

a cove from selling of short weight, is to put his name in print an

Well, coves who picks your pocket by selling you short weight is just

THE SWIGMOGRAPH.
QUR scientific readers are probably aware that an ingenious little
instrument has lately been invented for taking automatic tracings of
the throbbing of the pulse. From a couple of Greek words which
mean the writing, of pulsation, the inventor of the instrument has
christened it the “Sphygmograph:” and the name, we are informed,
has suggested the invention of another clever instrument, which, as a
“Fº will be fitly called the “Swigmograph.” -
The object of the Swigmograph will, as its name implies, consist in

good deal of alcoholic liquor, and, by an automatic action, recording

tions of a perilous repast. itual diners-out will find the Swigmo-
graph a salutary adjunct to their dressing-room, and may thank its
timely warnings for a fortunate escape from many a racking headache
or severe grip of the gout.
WHO CRIED “NO”?
“In our first article yesterday we said, ‘It is quite true that MR. GLAD-
stone said “No” when MR. HARDY asked whether MR. BRIGHT had authority
to announce the policy of the Cabinet.” The writer was mistaken in ascribing
the exclamation "No!" to MR. GLADstone. We have unimpeachable autho-
rity for stating that, whoever uttered it, the word did not come from the
Prime Minister.”—Morning Star, May 4.
THEN who was the Party that shouted out “No 1"
And .# caused a Conservative crow?
Q which of the partners in GLADstone & Co.

Methinks explanation the Ministers owe,
And Punch as he thinks so, takes leave to say so,
And then that eternal old cynical beau,
The like of whom lives not 'twixt Severn and Po,
And who’s wise as DE LoLME and DE STAEL and DE FoE,
Tosses off to your health a large glass of noyeau,
And proceeds, with a wink, this here chaff for to stow.
If a goose asks its reason, the answer is Bo!
WHY STRANGLE YOUR SOLDIERS P
SIR,
As an old soldier who has seen, and, doubtless, “done the
State some service,” as that actor fellow says, I have a right to my
opinion on the prospects of the Army; and my opinion is, by Jove, Sir!
that the Army is fast going to the deuce. I don't often read a news-
paper, but when I do I’m pretty sure to stumble upon something dis-
agreeable relating to the Service, and the other day I happened to
stumble upon this:—
“I feel convinced that the amount of aortic aneurism in the Army may be
much diminished by the tunic being fitted more loosely round the neck and
.#. portion of the chest; nor can I see the propriety of making any portion
of the soldiers' dress so tight as to place him at a great disadvantage in regard
to health, comfort and usefulness, when actively employed.”
This is what some doctor fellow, hang him has the impudence to
state, and I daresay there are fools who will believe him, and agree
with him in thinking that a soldier can't be comfortable if he be nearly
choked. Perhaps he’d like to see the Life-Guards dressed in flannel
shirts and wideawakes, like those ragged red-sleeved. Garibaldi, scare-
crows, and with, baggy knickerbockers, and a º of hobnailed high-
lows, to finish their costume. Pretty figures they would be for one's
iºn on parade; and how could any officer expect ’em to look
Smart
Those infernal doctor fellows always like to trot out fine new-fangled
words, and no doubt “aortic aneurism” is a new-fangled complaint.
In my young days I never heard it mentioned in the Army, but now
I’m {{i that soldiers are eleven times more likely to be attacked and
die of it than men not in the ranks. Of course civilians and taxpayers
and people of that sort, may grumble at the cost of thus killing o old
servants, for without a stiffish bounty one can't get new recruits. But
of course no British officer ever bores himself by thinking upon matters
of economy; and as for making troops more useful by giving them loose
tunics, who expects 'em to be useful while a Quaker fellow’s suffered
to sit among the Cabinet, and the Government encourages retrench-

but they see when others sleep.
“I have not met you, MR. Goosey,” observed MR. Owl, while
Goosey was irresolutely playing with the pen, “since you were three
or four years old.”
This reminiscence had in it something tender. It was as much as
MR. Owl, could say safely, and conscientiously, as regarded that
Invisible Presence, his Client.
To remind Goosey of those days had in it, I say, something of tender
warning. It seemed to say, “You are younger than I am by a lifetime.
I have known your father all these years. I understand him. You
don't. Take care.” But the handwriting on the parchment was mere
pot-hooks and hangers to Goosey, and the old Qwl's hint, if hint it
was intended to be, was utterly thrown away. In vain we told him

She could have met argument with argument: affirmative possibilities

cheerful and radiant, and generally interested in your personal matters,

of course parents’ consent, pockets a fee, and continues the ordinary

the sympathies of such a staid elderly couple as MR. and MRs. DoR-
MOUSE.
DoRMoUSE Senior came out very strongly on this occasion, promising
to lend him his expenses of a “call” to the Bar, which Goosey was

not a Duck swim, and a Goose too ! So we were confident and hopeful.
Goosey passed an examination, and obtained some, honourable dis-

THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF CORK.
UNDER the heading of “Extraordinary Proceedings at Cork,” the
Globe states that—
“On Sunday the MAYoR of CoRK went to the Bridewell, and discharged
the prisoners confined there.”

Demi et Demi.
IT used to be said that one half the world does not know how the
other half lives. As to the French world of fashion there is much
doubt if this º: holds good any longer, and no question that the
upper half well knows, and that by experience, how the under half
dresses. Please not to copy any longer.
Honour. To whom Honour Is DUE.
MR, OFFICER, the Speaker of the House of Assembly of Tasmania,
has been Knighted. It will be generally agreed that he is the proper
officer to receive this distinction.
THE SOLDIER'S P00R FEET.
SIR John FALSTAFF had a very good reason for objecting to march
through Coventry with his regiment of ragamuffins. Is it possible that
he would, if now in being, have had an objection, still better founded
to march through Fleet Street the other day with certain companies of
the gallant 98th P Doubtless, albeit revived in j". as when
he was not an eagle's talon in the waist, and could have crept into any
alderman's thumb-ring; when eight yards of uneven ground would
have been, not threescore and ten miles, but a joke with him. The
said 98th had to march from the other side of Šid: to the Tower
Wharf, a distance of nearly thirty miles, and by the time they passed
the quarters of Field Marshal Punch, were seen, by a correspondent of
the Times, most of them, hobbling. Knocked up even with that long
march along a level turnpike * Yes; as a troop of Spartan infantry would
have been in like case, forced to march all the way, as the 98th were,
in new boots—a forced march truly. The Times sensibly suggests that
now, when it is proposed to employ the leisure time of our soldiers in
some kind of industry, a few shoemakers, who could see where the
military shoe pinches, and put it right, might be attached to every
regiment. At present there appears to be a sad deficiency of respectable
Shoemakers in the ranks of the British Army, whilst, among those
superior persons who are responsible for the way in which its Foot is
shod, there are some very bungling Snobs. It is all to no purpose that
we talk of improving the condition of the British soldier, and putting
him on a better footing, when every man who knows how badly the
Lobster, as he is vulgarly called, is off for what the vulgar also term
Crabshells, would, on no account, like to be in his shoes.
VERY QUEER FISH.
According to the Hampshire Independent:—
“An American contemporary says fish may be kept alive for ten days or
more without water by filling their mouths with crumbs of bread saturated
with brandy, and Fº a little brandy in their stomachs, after which, in
this torpid state, they may be packed in straw. They become alive in a few
hours when again placed in fresh water.”
And then, one would think, they must be very fresh themselves.
The freshness of the fresh water, however, which refreshes the fish, we
jº. to mean the contrary to vapidness, and not the absence
of salt; though of all the scaly and finny race,
“Fishes that tipple in the deep,”
should be the most capable of standing spirits, and the least of being
reduced to insensibility, by brandy. It may, indeed, be argued that
salt-water fish are apt at times to #. half-seas-over, and thus screwed
in some degree, if not to that of being absolutely tight. But this is
the unscrupulous sophistry of an abandoned punster. It is occasionally
said of a bibulous person that he drinks like a fish; that is, practises
the reverse of total abstinence without being the worse for liquor.
The truth, however, is, even if the above-quoted statement is true,
instead of being simply American, that the only fish who ever get
drunk are fish out of water.
DE POTATORE EXCLUDENDO.
DR. MANNING, the illicit Archbishop of Westminster, advocating a
liquor law, argued at St. James's Hall, the other evening, the justice of
such a law from “the admitted right” of majorities, in these days to
impose legislation upon a minority againstits will. Oh, DR. MANNING!
No such right is now admitted more than it ever was. The minority
never recognised the right—only submitted to the might. And to-day,
if DR. MANNING and his associates were a majority instead of a minority,
the majority that now is, then reduced to a minority, would as little
admit the right of the greater number to debar it from liquoring up, as
the few under HENRY THE FourTH admitted the right of the many to
restrict their liberty of conscience by the statute de haretico comburendo.
THE HIGH HORSE AND THE HOBBY-HORSE.
THE Cavalry of the English Church Militant consists of the richer
class of parsons; its dignified clergymen are the Church dragoons; of
course its bishops are all jº. even its archdeacons mostly
E. to deliver, their charges upon chargers. The Curates, as a
ody, constitute the Church infantry, and may be described as the
ján g clergy. For the ecclesiastical Foot ſº and those of
their superior officers who cannot well afford to keep horses, the
Church iew suggests that sº “may become a useful means
of rapid communication.” Very likely; but what the more zealous of
the divines who form the two leading divisions of the clerical corps
want much rather is a means of rapid excommunication.

han one with an East wind in May P
A melancholy sky, of lead,

Án air, bedimmed with highting haze,
Look where *...". offends your gaze;
Branches with nipt, shrunk leaves, the trees
Toss wildly in the blustering breeze;
The lilac-bloom is faded, sere;

The song-birds all have ceased to twitter,
Because the weather is so bitter;
You shiyer in the blinding gust,
hilst in your eyes it blows the dust.
And then §. think about poor souls
In want of blankets and of coals,
And letters to the Times enclose,

The Irish Puzzle.
CERTAINLY, the Irish are a riddle. If it is proposed to
treat them exactly as if they were English, there is a blaze
about our Philistinism, and non-understanding of nation-
ality. But when they practise “wild justice,” and set law
at defiance, we are warned not to deal with them except
by the most scrupulous rules of English law. As their own
poet writ (of Love or Friendship)—
“Which shall it be—how shall we woo
Erin, choose between the two.”

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 10. , SIMON SCROPE of Danby wants the Wiltes
Peerage. It was created in the time of Ricº. The Second. His
successor, our HENRI QUATRE, cut off the head of the Peer, and the
House of Lords, after long and patient consideration, decides that this
operation º: him. The DUKE of CLEVELAND, who appears
to think that a Peer can do without a head, wanted to revise the deci-
sion, but the Lords held that, the beheading finished the business.
This did LoRD SYDNEY go and tell the QUEEN, at Windsor.
Their Lordships then spoiled the Scotch Education Bill. Scotland,
except—and please to note the exception—the Scotch clergy, desires
the measure. That single line explains the case. Our Primate homestiy
showed his hand by objecting to a Bill which brought, the Lords into
collision with questions that affected both England and Scotland. Just
so, dear Archbishop. But the collision will come; and if Questions
mean hindrances to *g. education, may we respectfully remind
your Grace of GEORGE, STEPHENson's answer, before a Committee, in
the pre-railway days: “Suppose a cow should come into collision with
a train P’’ “So much the worse for the coo.”
LoRD Colonsay, new and yenerable, Scottish law peer, was actually
for introducing a clause enacting that the wee laddies and lassies should
be taught the Shorter Catechism of the Kirk of Scotland. But the
DUKE of ARGYLL objected to incorporate that document, in an Act of
Parliament. There is only one Catechism that ought to be, taught to
any child, and that is our old friend Isaac WATTs’s “First.” Without
speaking of the dreadful Scotch and hideous Westminster bundles of
ogmas, see the difference between WATTs's and that of our beloyed
Mother Church. She begins, “What’s your name ** He begins,
t 9. #" tell me, my child, who made you?” Which is the religious
eacner
A notice * in the Commons about opening Museums on Sundays,
reminds us that some persons fear that this will lead to the opening
Theatres on that day. This again leads us to a speech made by MR.
Bucks.TONE at the General Theatrical Fund Dinner last week. He
said that no member of his own Haymarket. Theatre would ever consent
to perform on Sunday, and he believed that such was the feeling of his
Profession. Also, he stated that great numbers of actors and actresses
regularly go to church it is satisfactory to know this, and likewise
that the Stage does not encourage Dissent. -
A long debate, begun by MR, CORRANCE, on Pauperism and Wa-
grancy. MR. Gösch EN admitted the alarming extent of pauperism,
and the consequent deplorable increase of expenditure. Nothing par-
ticular came ; the discussion, but there seems to be a growing convic-
tion that as workhouses are to be found everywhere, vagrancy is
*::::: an easy profession, and that the tramp should be treated as
a Criminal.
Law Court battle again. MR. STREET is preparing his plans for
what is wittily called the Lowe site. SIR. RoundELL PALMER menaces
his best opposition. By the way, Mr. Punch, who never forgets any:
thing, and is justice incarnate, intimates that there is bad taste and not
altogether fair play on the part of the Government in allowing the Law
Courts Commission, at the head of which was SIR. R. PALMER, to be
abused for extravagance and absurdity. For, SIR, RquMDELL was MR;
GLADSTONE's Attorney-General in the last Liberal Administration, and
was then entrusted with the business of officially defending the Čom.
mission and its purchase.
Tuesday. A morning sitting of Commons in order to deal with the
Cork Buttermonger. As Macheath sings-
“The Court is prepared, the Counsel are met,
The Judges all ranged, a terrible show.”
But the Mayor caved in—denuded himself of his robe-declared by
letter (read by MR. MAGUIRE) that he had not meant to justify assas;
sins, and resigned his office. So Head-Master GLApstone, who had
previously remarked, in the old scholastic rhyme, to Monitor Edward

be—nefit, abstained from laying it on, and in consideration of DAN's
penitence, permitted him to adjust his garments, and retire, with a
severe warning. Wide Cartoon.
In the Lords, the MARQUIs of Townshend proposed two out of
about a dozen bills of his, framed for the most part in the interest of
humanity. One was to protect the property of Lodgers who owe no
rent, yet have their goods seized by a landlord, the other for punishing
iº, on women and children; The former Bill was opposed
on technical and worthless grounds. Against the latter it was alleged
that such assaults are becoming less ..". and therefore new legis-
lation is not needed. We should be glad to believe it. None of Lord
TownshenD's, Bills will be carried, but none the less, honour to a
Christian nobleman who, in the House and out of it, defies the vulgar
grin of those who call him “eccentric" because he believes that pro-
perty has its duties. . If he gambled away a magnificent ancestral
estate, like one peer, debauched until he killed himself, like another, or
| ran away with his bosom friend's wife, like a third, he would not be
laughed at, but ºl. “poor fellow !”
roperty has its Duties. But its Taxes, at least those on Real pro-
perty, are light. At least so contended MR., FowleR, and r a
debate of much prosiness. MR. Lowe, said the question involved a
roblem which he could not solve then, but he promised that if an idea
#. upon him, the country should hear of it. So he merrily escaped
the snare of the fowler. Apropos whereof, there was a quarrel over
Scotch game again, and a one-sided Committee, which MR. LQGH had
compounded, but not to the satisfaction of other Scots. Evidently, Scot-
| land is waking up on this game question, and, when she really wakes
she has a habit of not going to sleep again until the rousing matter has
just been settled. -
County Financial Boards—do you want to know anything about
them? Punch supposes not. Do you remember, Mr. Huggins, in
flºws Epping Hunt, who, being run away with by his horse, thought
tha
“He never saw a County go
At such a County Rate.”
Wednesday. In the Lords—now, then, MM. Clever? The Lords
don't sit on Wednesday. They don't, eh? Have you any other valuable
information on the science of egg-sucking to impart to your
| mother?... Perhaps the PRINCE OF WALEs is not a member of the
House of Lords, and perhaps the EARL or PUNCH is not going to
note, with satisfaction and delight, that this day the PRINCE and
PRINCEss of WALEs returned to England, after months of absence in
the East and elsewhere, lunched with HER MAJESTY, embraced their
infants, who were brought up from Windsor, went with the QUEEN to
the Royal Academy, drove in the Park, and attended a State Concert.
Šays Brown to jºoNEs, “You and I are temperate fellows, and more-
over have cellars of our own. RoPINson may be tempted to drink too
much. Let us shut up all the public-houses. He has no cellar. Then
he must be sober, and his wife and children will get his wages.” . So
BRowN and Jones get SIR WILFRID LAwson to ask Parliament to
allow a majority of two-thirds to shut up the public-houses.
Parliament is right. But, as MR. ForsTER said, the Permissive Bill
is demanded by “the aristocracy of the working classes,” and though
this plan for repressing drunkenness will not do, their wishes must be
considered. -
There was a long debate. Colon ELJERVIs opposed an infringement
of the rights of the subject. MR. O. MoRGAN believed that some such
| Special enactment would do much to put down, drunkenness. MR.
CAWLEY did not approve of this Bill, but would support any prac-
ticable project for reducing the number of public-houses. To MR.
BAZLEY, who had º: to repeat the silly slang about “not making
men moral by Act of Parliament,” MR. ForsTER said, “No, but you
may diminish their temptations.” Punch hoped that slang was extinct,
but it is too foolish not to live long—idiots do, and so do shallow
phrases. LoRD SANDON believed that the working, classes were
reforming themselves. MR. WALTER dwelt on the evils of gin-drinking
which was worse than beer-drinking. MR. JACQB BRIGHT sup orted
the Bill, but hoped there would be a sharp and general interference
with the liquor c. He would legislate in the style in which they
had dealt with the Irish Church. -
The Hoxie SECRETARY spoke most sensibly and satisfactorily. The
present system must be considerably changed. But education was the
chief remedy. The upper classes were sober, because they had mental
resources. But the class whose only enjoyments were sensual, instinc-
tively drank. Repressive measures must, however, be adopted, and
hitherto no Government had been strong enough to carry a valuable
measure, because representatives were afraid of certain influences.
Now that the franchise was widely spread, those influences would
greatly diminish. . [Bungo, “mine host,” how do you like that?] It
was #. honest intention of the Government to deal with the ques-
tion next Session, and meet the wishes of the people, without inter-
fering with innocent enjoyment.
So the Permissive Bill was rejected by 193 to 87
out for BRUCE's Permits.
and next year look
Punch points out to the superior class of
respectful attention to their desires, and rejects this Bill because it is
hoped to give something fairer and better.
Thursday. Last day before the Holidays. So Old Russell (we use
the adjective as schoolboys do, not irreverently) thought he would
have a lark, and suddenly bonneted Qld GRAN VILLE, cheeking him
about Irish land policy, and telling him he had better have minded that
than bankruptcy and schools. Or, if you want to be serious, he accused
the Government of having encouraged dangerous hopes, and held
them, by their silence, responsible for MR. BRight's plans.
|... Lord GRANVILLE had nothing to say but what he had said before.
He announced nothing. Government were not responsible for MR.

OI property.
| Lond DERby said that the Irish had been led to believe that no more
|rent was to be after 1870. He drew a pleasing parallel between
|M. BRIGHT the Buttermonger. The plans of the former would
convulse Ireland, and before they were promulgated he hoped that the
army in that country would be largely increased.
| Ioap KIMBERLEY_replied with a tu quoque, setting his Lordship
right in respect to MR. BRIGHT, and the Duke of ABERCORN (late
Lord-Lieutenant) contrasted the Fº unhappy, state of things,
#. by MR., BRIGHT and his friends, with the tranquillity
of Ireland under himself and the Conservatives. LoRD WESTMEATH-
but weimagine that will do. My Lords, having thus finished the pre-
Whitsuntide sittings with a good row, rose until the 31st.
There was no disturbance in the Commons. The General Omnibus
Company having failed to defeat the Tramways in Committee, tried to
spoil the Bill in the House, by º leave to run any vehicles on the
tramway. MR. Baught exposed the dodge in language which even a
conductor would call straightforward, and the Buss Coves were floored.
We were told that in rural districts the postmen were, if they liked,
to ride on velocipedes, or bicycles; but, said Lond HARTINaton,
gº: the art of riding those articles is not included in the Civil
- Examination, the thing is to be, optional. We can imagine
:* CELIA, in her arbour (0 thanks, MB. Leslie), singing
ºx “Don’t blame, dear Mamma, this ecstatical throb,
But the Bicycle Brought me a Billet from Bob.”
Then did we finally Consider the Irish Church Bill, as amended, fix
the Third Reading for the 31st, and after some fudget details, not
unamusing, including a complaint, by MR. Lowe that when there was
an alleged grievance the “Inevitable Widow” was always brought up,
we rose until Thursday, the 27th.
THE ZERO OF FRAUD.
Is it come to this? Under the head of “Notices of Motions,” in a
programme of “Parliamentary Business” recently printed, there was
the following entry:-
“LoRD Eicho.—To call attention to the adulteration of manures; and to
move that, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that the attention of
the Board of Trade should be directed to this subject.”
Has commercial rascality descended even to the adulteration of
manures P Why this is worse than TENNyson's conception of the
pharmaceutical rogue “pestling a poisoned poison.” It is the lowest
conceivable depth of dirty dishonesty. British mercantile morality
must indeed be at a low ebb if LoRD ELCHO has reason for bringing
the adulteration of manure itself before the House of Commons. What
will Parliament do to prevent it? We can imagine what the Collective
Wisdom of our ancestors would have done. It would have doomed the
debaser of manure to stand in the pillory, and be pelted with his own
wares—purified.

THE British Medical Journal publishes an analysis of sow's milk by PROFEssor
CAMERoN, of Dublin, showing that it contains 18:20 parts of solid matter per cent,

tuents of the former fluid the º of lactin, or sugar of milk, as stated by the
Professor, very nearly approaches the average º existing in the natural

cessive . would therefore perhaps be considered by the Faculty to dis-
qualify its producer for the situation of wet-nurse, for which her aptitude might
seem to be suggested by the largeness of the saccharine element in her milk, as

LOOK OUT,

THE Lancet some time ago called attention, not before it was needed, to the wretchedly insani-
tary state of the Guard-room at Buckingham Palace, where, in the Sergeants' room more par-
ticularly, the arrangements for slow poisoning by foul air were carried to a pitch of perfection

which has control of the inside of the Guard-
board of works. And the Board of Works,
on the plea that the new windows were an architectural disfigurement, has given, so says the
Lancet, peremptory orders to the War Office to put things “as they were.”
The Lancet must be wrong. The head of
the Board of Works is called LAYARD. His
antecedents have shown that if he cares for
architecture much, he cares for the British
soldier more... We call upon him from his
place in Parliament to contradict the slan-
ders of the Lancet, and to assure us that if
he has shut up one window in the Sergeants'
room at Buckingham Palace, it is only that
he may open two. -
We were not aware, till so informed by
the Lancet, that the architecture of Bucking-
ham Palace could be spoiled. But if the
Board of Works considers that such a feat is
possible, we are sure it will not be done by
opening a window in the dog-hole known as
the Sergeants’ room; and that the most
aesthetic passer-by will ladly compound for
the irregular opening, when it is understood
to be . only provision for light and air in
a room occupied by the non-commissioned
officers in authority over soldiers who keep
watch against, the intrusion of possible boy
Joneses into the Palace of the Sovereign.
A PRETTY SIGHT IN PARIS.
AFTER all it seems that there is still some
good taste extant in the drawing-rooms of
Paris, although, from what the fashion-books
and newspapers have told us, we may perhaps
have doubted if such could be the case. Mais
voilà la preuve:—
“Some young ladies of the élite of Parisian
society have obtained at the last fétes a real
success, by showing themselves with their hair
| simply braided.”
Hair. “simply braided” is indeed to our
mind simply charming, and we wonder how
| young ladies who have F. heads
|can disfigure them with chignons and simi-
lar excrescences. A girl who simply braids
| her hair and wears nothing on her head but
that which Nature has implanted there, will
F. the eye not only of the lover of the
beautiful, but, in like degree of the admirer
of the sensible. A pleasant sight she like-
wise will present to the phrenologist, who
in these days of monstrous feminine hirsute-
ness can rarely get the chance of a sight of a
girl's head; so much false hair is Theaped
upon it.
A simple glance would be sufficient, where
the hair was simply braided, to show which
bumps, or organs, appeared the most deve-
loped. Those of modesty and candour would
beF. no doubt: while those of vanity
and folly would be reduced to cavities. A
man who wants to marry should look out for
a girl whose hair is simply braided, for he
then could form some notion of her cerebral
qualities, before it was too late to escape
being their victim.
The Gravity of a Flea.
By an ingenious little instrument which is
called a pulexometer, it has been found that
the strength of the Puler, irritans, or do-
mestic flea, is “equal to eight hundred times
its specific gravity.” Without in the least
questioning the truth of this scientific state-
ment, we may be allowed to say that it really
seems a joke to talk about a flea's “specific
gravity.”. As if any one could specify the
gravity of a flea! One might as well attempt
to chronicle the humour of a cockchafer, as
pretend to specify the gravity of a flea.

I’d better steer my course to have a look at London, and spin a yarn

I hailed was my own brother BILL, as was on duty at the station,
when our train came to its moorings. He’s a policeman now, is BILL,
and has growed out of all knowledge, º: Íºm best if f'd have
known him, for he's growed a stubby beard and sort of toothbrushy
moostarch, which he used to go as cleanshaved about the mouth and chin
as any sailor in the service. But hullo, JACK! says he, and hullo, BILL!
says I; after which ...; welcome, BILL, I says, why who’s your

his shaving brush and scraping iron for upwards of a month or more,
and, though the boys they chaffed him cruel, he found his beard a wery

was more imagination than literal true fact.
Well, thinks I, me and my messmates we’d be thankful for the same,

A RETREAT FROM THE MARRIAGE MARKET.
AT a time when marriage, owing to the cost of housekeeping and
millinery, has become impossible for gentlemen of limited means, and
the generality of young ladies are either eating their heads off or going

of an opening for any pictorial talent their daughters may possess at
“The Female Gallery of Art,” established at 104, Great Russell Street,
Bloomsbury, “for the sale of works of art executed by ladies only.”

A Safe Irish Landlord.
THERE is one argument in favour of MR. BRIGHT's
scheme for the purchase of Irish estates by the Govern-
ment, which the EARL OF DERBY, perhaps, has not con-
sidered. That plan would constitute Government the
Landlord of Ireland. Government, might E. get
payment of rent, or the price of land resold, by enforcing
it, and Government is a kind of Landlord that could not be
shot from behind a hedge.

§ the 7th instant, according to a newspaper, was cele-
brated at Orleans the fête of the famous Maid of that ilk. Christmas
comes but once a year, and when it comes it brings a variety of demon-
strations. The same may, with a difference, be said of JEANNE DARC's
anniversary. The difference is chiefly that the latter has no pantomime
performed in its honour; though JoAN OF ARC, just now, is the victim
of a burlesque at the Strand Theatre. ... It was, however, observed the
other day “with the usual ceremony,” Orleans was decorated with
flags, the principal inhabitants of the vicinity were present, and—
* A e number of the Episcopal hierarchy took part in the festival;
amongst them being the Archbishops of Rouen and Bourges, the Bishops of
Beauvais, Poitiers, Chalons, Nancy, Werdun, Saint Dié, Blois, Troyes, Con-
stantina, and lastly of Orleans. The civil and military cortégé, started from
the bridge and arrived at eight o'clock at the Cathedral. The Mayor handed
fºundam to the ARCHBishop of Rouen, who pronounced a

Which unfortunately is not reported. We can only imagine what
his Grace of Rouen said. Perhaps something of this sort:--"We
are here to celebrate the festival of a Flºriº heroine, martyr to

or an impostor?, To imagine her an impostor would be to insult
France. If she had been indeed a saint, in the sense of the Church,
the ecclesiastical authorities, with the predecessor of my venerable
brother here º in the see of Beauvais, PIERRE GAUCHON, woul
not have e the immense mistake of pronouncing her a witch, and
causing her to be burnt alive. Let us draw a curtain over all that:
As to witchcraft we well know that it is nothing more than a heretical
superstition, condemned solely as such by the bull of Pope INNOCENT
THE EIGHTH, This bull did not commit infallibity to any assertion of
the mediaeval belief in witchcraft. As JEANNE DARC was no impostor,
it follows that she could have been no witch, and CAUCHON and his
coll es—whom I will not call cochons—erred, it must be avowed, with
a deplorable º: It was the temporary aberration of a mis-
informed trib now reversed by the authority present here to-day
of no less than twelve Bishops. Was then, JEANNE DARC a lunatic f
No, no—a thousand times no. She had, without doubt, a fixed idea;
but that idea was noble. What was she, then? I say a generous, a
sublime, a devoted enthusiast. Honour, immortal honour to the
memory of the Maid of Orleans ! She would not have been misun-
derstood in the *. day. We enjoy the happiness of living in the
civilisation of the nineteenth century, so fine a thing for France and
Humanity, except in those points which have been condemned #.

MR. PUNCH is glad of MR. HoRsMAN's election, for the House is
not lively. But the mysterious explanation given by the new Member
for Liskeard of the reason for his return smacks of the Cave of
Trophonius, rather than that of Adullam. The Liberal majority was
for the millionnaire, LYcETT, when down came the Tories like Cedron

THE RUM AND MILK CURE FOR CLERGYMEN.
CAN it be that the Right Reverend the "Bishop of MANCHESTER
is acquainted with a certain celebrated matron named GRUNDY : . It
can hardly be otherwise; and the excellent Bishop appears to cherish a
very grave deference for that lady's criticisms of the personal habits of
clergymen. So at least it would seem from the judgment reported as
below in the Times to have been, after mature deliberation, delivered
the other day for him by DR. BAYFoRD, chancellor of his Lordship's
diocese, and one of his assessors at a court of inquiry respecting
allegations of drunkenness preferred against the REv; L. H. MoR-
DACQUE, for the last eighteen years perpetual curate and titular vicar
of Haslingden:—
“The charges were all dismissed on the ground that the evidence for the
defence, on the whole, outweighed the evidence on the other side. At the
same time it was remarked, as a curious coincidence, and one evidently open
to misconstruction, that the defendant should have persisted in the use of such
a medicine as rum and milk, instead of adopting some remedy equally effica-
cious and less equivocal. The conduct º two of the complainants was no
doubt open to comment, but in the case of the third there could be no possible
reflection on the nature of the prosecution; there had been a clear case, for
inquiry, and under these circumstances each party should pay his own costs.”
But it was proved in evidence, that Mr. MoRDAcquE's medical
attendant “had sanctioned a prescription of rum and milk for him, as
he was in a weak and nervous state.” Then who could possibly have
suggested to Manchester's estimable ºl. that the reverend gentle-
man's persistence “in the use of such a medicine, as rum and milk
instead of adopting some remedy equally efficacious and less equivocal,”
was a curious circumstance, and one evidently open to misconstrug-
tion”? The openness of such a circumstance to misconstruction is
not evident at all, MR. MoRDAcquE could perhaps not have taken
any remedy equally efficacious with rum and milk for the cure of his
complaint; and rum is rum, nothing can be plainer: rum is a remedy
not equivocal at all, how rum soever. Nor would the circumstance
that he persisted in the use of rum and milk be at all curious, even if
he could have used any remedy that would have been equally effica-
cious. He prefer rum and milk to a remedy equally efficacious
but less agreeable. Then why should he not take rum and milk? Only
because †. GRUNDY says he mustn't.
The good, Bishop of MANCHESTER could have derived his ideas of
h the unsuitableness of rum and milk as a cure for a clergyman onl
from MRs. GRUNDY., Nobody else could have put them into his head.
MRs. GRUNDY says all she can to restrict the liberty of the clergy in a
great manythings indifferent. She condemns a clergyman for smoking
cigars, to say nothing of a cutty pipe, unless he smokes on the sly.
|For Mrs. Ganny doesn't blame ſºpºcrisy, she objects to a parson's
taking a hand at whist, or standing up in a, country-dance, or riding
occasionally after the hounds. She prohibits him, from wearing a
pudding-bowl hat or a black-tie, or from growing a beard. A Curate
is required by Mrs. GRUNDY to lunch on a piece of plum-cake and a
#. of currant-wine rather than on a biscuit and sherry. Rum and milk
or a clergyman, even though taken medicinally, she calls. a potation
only less awf improper than early purl-of which liquor MRs.
GRUNDY knows the ingredients. It is quite clear that the judgment of
the respected Bishop of MANchestER touching the REv. MoR-
DACQUE in regard to rum and milk was, in fact, her judgment. A bad
job this for the defendant, who, though acquitted, had, having employed
SERJEANT PARRY and MR. ADDIson, to pay his own costs.
In the defence of the abovenamed learned Serjeant's calumniated
client, says the Times:–
“It was implied #: of the testimony that MR. MoRDACQUE had been
on the side of the Liberals at the North-East Lancashire Election.”
But whatsoever influence this fact may have had upon MR. MoR-
DACQUE's accusers, we may rest satisfied that it exercised none on his
#. whose sentence, in so far as it was a condemnation of rum and
milk as an uncanonical remedy, may be safely presumed to have been
the º expression of the s ecifically clerical and perhaps pedagogical
mind, dominated by MRs. GRUNDY.

porary resting-place where they have reposed since 1847, when he died, with
t pomp, to the tomb raised for him by national contribution in Glasnevin
emetery.”—Dublin News of May 14th.
BEAR his bones, with all pomp, from the place they have kept
For the twenty-two years that have .# since he slept,
To the tomb that his Erin has painfully reared
For the Champion she loved, and her enemies feared.
There's a time to note sharply, a time to pass by,
The flaw in the brilliant, the cloud in the sky:
There’s a time to be gen’rous, nor narrowly scan
The stains on a mem'ry, the faults in a man.
Standing now by his tomb, who devoted his life,
With wrong and oppression to wage deadly strife,
Till from Captive, Emancipate, Erin he saw,
In the liberty won by the triumph of Law,
Why gauge the alloy that was mixed with his gold.”.
Earth and matrix why weigh, 'gainst the gems in their hold?
A great work was laid on him, and that work he wrought;
He’d a battle to fight, and that battle he fought.
And he wrought to good end, and he fought till he won,
And the sum of injustice was less 'neath the sun:
Let what smallness or selfishness darkens his name
Be drunk up and drowned in the light of that fame.
Let us think of the warm heart, still open, at need,
To the wronged of his race, the oppressed of his creed:
H.; by pelf, and undaunted by power,
Too noble to crawl, and too daring to cower.
Let us think of the big brain, and eloquent tongue,
That like Erin's own clair-seach * now wailed, and now rung,
Q'er the wrongs of the slaves he was vowed to set free,
Or in praise of his green isle, his gem of the sea!
On the bier that is borne to Glasnevin to-day,
One offering the band of the Saxon can lay-
The Bill that the Church of the stranger strikes down—
Of the work of his life consummation and crown |
Last link of the º red-rusted with gore,
Forged by Saxon for Celt, in the ill-times of yore,
At whose crushing coil, forty long years ago,
His hand struck the first and the deadliest blow !
* The ancient Irish harp.
Next Year, if not This.
THE Royal Academy have accomplished great things-enclosed their
Exhibition within handsome walls and their *. in neat covers;
revived the spirits of sculptors, and refreshed hungry and, thirsty
visitors; done honour to foreign painters, and done justice both to
home and foreign art, by hanging pictures neither too high nor too
low. Will they not undertake one more reform—label every picture
and sculpture with the name of the artist and title of his work? How
the weary would bless them "

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S DERBY PROPHECY.
Y pensive pachyderms,
here we are again, wise
as an owl, merry as a
kitten, and punctual as
the Equinoxious Proces-
sion. What fool in human
form propagated the re-
port that Punch would
have no prophecy this
year? I should like to
prop a gate with him tied
to it, and shy turmuts at
him till he cried peccory,
which you may see at the
theological gardens any
Sunday. No Prophecy!
Sooner than give you
none, he'd give you the
Prophecy of DANTE, with
notes by his sister ANN
DANTE, whose name is on
all the songs. But I for-
give him at this Festival
time. I dare say the
idiotic report originated
in the utter downfall,
scrunch, and smash up of
all the advertising pro-
phets who beg for money
before they predict. Look
at their advertisements.
How the fellows have all
tailed off Their small
merit of coarse cheekiness
(how different from the
elegant badinage of your
Punch () is gone. Where
be their chaff and slang
and impudence now? A
more melancholy set of
beggars doesn't mendi-
cantize. But let us not
contemplate any of those
wretched screws. Leave
'em in their sordid cribs.
Here is Punch, the aris-
tocratic, high - blooded,
generous-minded, frank-
speaking, affable Punch to
the fore again, with the eyes of an eagle, the voice of a SANTLEy, and the smile
of a Mephistopheles, sunning his white brow on the hill of Epsom, cooling his
melodious throat with Moselle-cup, and smoking his one and threepenny cigar
promiscuous and anti-pleonastic as ever. And how are you all? Pretty Robertish
That's right. And should a cloud of gloom perversely linger,
Let us at once fling every care away
In the enjoyment of this Derby Day
(Punch, 1847.)
Do I know the Winner? There's a question Does Mr. Disraeli know Mr.
GLADston E! Does an English dramatist know Mr. JEffs? Do the Siamese Twins
know one another, or are they waiting to be introduced? Shall I chalk his name
down your respected back, Sir? Or shall I whisper it to the violets in that sweetly
gloved hand, BELINDA I' faith, ye make me smile, you merry throng, as the
marine-store keeper's placard has it. Let us take things easily. Festina lente—fast
in Lent—but eat at Whitsuntide and afterwards, yea, and drink. Your healths
and may your rosy hours roll gently like perfumed bubbles into the abyss of Time.
Do I know the Winner of the Derby? You make me give Echo a headache. Away
to thy Boeotian Narcissus, sweet nymph of the Cephisus, I will call on thee thus
rudely no more. And thou, well-instructed-in-classics BELINDA, smile not that
Bob, reading this to thee, boggled over the river's name, doubtful of quantity. Yet
do, for I like well to see thee smile, BELINDA. Thy health !
Farewell, farewell, the voice you hear Has left its last Soft tones with you. The
next must join the Starting cheer, And shout among the welshing crew. Horses,
horses, produce your horses, and let the Great Prophet behold ! H'm — A
Rum Lot, yet things may be worse than rum—old rum. I detect merit under
some of those silken skins. Be pleased to name the animals as they pass me,
my dear MR. DoRLING. I am glad to see you looking so well, MR. DoRLING,
and all your arrangements are as c’rect as your cards—can I give you higher
praise 2 This quadruped is termed—what? Thorwaldsen. A great sculptor's
name. A name to be reverenced. He who bears it should cut a pretty figure.
At least he should cut out the running, and chisel many. The next? Rupert.
My Lord DER BY bath won the name of Rupert, but I debate much with myself
whether Rupert will win the Derby. Should he tumble down, we will playfully
call the feat a Rupert's drop. Vagabond. Let me look again. “Stick to your
pantomimes, vagabond,” wrote JUNIts to GARRick, but this vagabond is no pan-
WOL. LVI.
tomime steed. Howbeit, all depends upon whether he be fugitive and vagabond.
You can put money upon him, if you like, but you had better not, as it will all fall
off as soon as he begins to move. A vagabond is usually a beggar, and here comes
one who loved a beggar-maid. King Cophetua, in Elysium, be proud, for DANIEL
MacLise hath this year made thee an entity, or, for the better understanding of
young swells, a fact. But for the horse which is named after the affectionate king,
l affection him not hugely. Leontes, another king? I'fecks? Why that's my baw-
cock. What, hast smutched thy nose? Mine honest friend, will you take eggs for
money? Wonder not, Belinda (are you there, sweet one? 'tis well) at these words
—they come from out the play whence Leontes takes name, and no one heeds the
appropriateness of a quotation: the point is to show that you are a scholar. Take
away Leontes, boy, pecunia on him were Perdita. But who is this? Ethus And
why his name * My friend Argus says that Ethus was a swift Scottish King—what,
another king? I rather hold with my friend, Lord Winchilsea, who, as Lord of
the Manor of Wye, is ever ready with a good Because, that the name is muddled
from that of Æthon, one of the horses of the Sun. But it from the Greek for a
custom, he is a custom I honour not in this observance. Erit tyrannus, Regum
ultimus, and after Kings let us behold a Pretender, usually of a better blood than
they. Come on, proud steed, and sun thyself in BELINDA's eyes, brighter than
Phoebus above-named. Well, what shall we say—what shall we sing, but a
Jacobite rhyme *
“Heaven bless the King, Heaven bless the Faith's Defender,
Bless—there's no harm in blessing the Pretender.
Which the Pretender is, and which the King,
Heaven bless us all, is quite another thing.”
That was a good story, well recollected by Mr. SALA. “when Lady STRANGE,
the widow of the famous engraver, was old and well-nigh paralytic, a pert young
gentleman once happened to speak in her presence of Charles Edward as “tho
Pretender.” “Pretender, and be d–d to you !' cried old LADY STRANGE, from her
arm-chair. Was this masculine? No; it was but a burst of manliness.” Lead on
the noble beast, honoured boy. Merry it is in the good green wood—faith, we are
musical to-day, but fine spirits are finely touched by a word, and here comes
MR. Merry's Belladrum. This is the people's idol. A cynic would say that I have
said enough. But I have not. Bells and drums should be the harbingers of merri-
ment. I say unhesitatingly that this horse will be beaten if his jockey flogs him.
Martyrdom-if he is just in (which he will not be), his owner can call him. JustiN
Martyr-dom, if he ever heard of that Christian Apologist. Perry Down is a name
that looks like a joke, but is n't one. Howbeit, if you drank a glass of perry, it
would be perry down, and being inside you, there is an opening for an industrious
young joke about in-cider. But mind what I am going to say. Perry is made of
Pear-juice. Do you understand that? Very well, then, remember it. Here is
Perry Gomez—no, Pero. Now, don't go generalising and jumping at conclusions, or
you may come a cropper. What I said about the last horse by no means applies to
this one. Pero may go down to Zero, yet be quicksilver still.
Ha! Brown Ladas. He was a famous courier in classic days, and victor at the
Olympic games—it is a good horse-name. He won the Convivial Stakes, and as
Epsom is, if anything, a convivial meeting, that omen is good. Ride, Custance,
ride And this is the Drummer? Not handsome, assuredly, but give him the
benefit of the proverb, and let him go, the rather that he can stay. Cometh the
Puke of Beaufort to be again beaten by Belladrum, or comes he for vengeance? Duz
means a leader, but some leaders are very heavy—look at the newspapers. Bosworth?
He who there cried, (in 1485, BELINdA,) “A horse; a horse my kingdom for a
horse!" meant not a horse like this. Alpenstock. Methinks he should be good at
getting up the hill—“whate'er he is, he shows a mountain mind.” Lord Hawthorn
is a new peer, I find him not in Debrett, but let him prove himself one of Nature's
nobility, if he can. His name is of good odour-marked you, my Bellsda, how
sweet was the scent of the blossoms? Master Whiffler may be a good boy, but the
Derby is no child's play, and Ryshworth, good to look at, is not worth a rush, nor
will he make one, ugly or pretty. De Vere, aristocrat, I fear me your manners have
too much repose for the rough sport of the day. Border Knight, chivalry comes
from cheval, no doubt, but we will mount the horse foaled of an acorn if you lead
the charge to-day. Brennus comes, but not for conquest, nor is it at our
weighing here that we throw a sword into the scale. The AEgeant I want
nothing from the Ægean save Cos, whose lettuces are welcome to our salad,
Belinda. And so they have passed, like the years that have fled. Truly, as
Bottom saith, I have an exposition of sleep come upon me. Nappiness is
the best substitute for happiness. I would repose. Lead me to my carriage,
and throw the handkerchief of Peace over the countenance of Virtue. I dream a
dream, and I see a vision—horses there be, but no mightmares. What do I behold 7
Comes the dream through the gate of Ebony or Ivory? I see a mighty rush of horse-
men upon glittering steeds, and the horsemen are gaily attired in all the colours of
the rainbow, the various Iris, who came from Juno to cut the hair of the departing
Queen of Carthage, see Virgil and other classical authors. Some of the horses are
before, others, on the contrary, are behind. They shift their places, they change,
they dodge, like unto the little black pig who ran about so that the negro could not
count him. Ha 1 from the ruck there press forward a few, and they make fiercely
for the goal—fiercely ply the riders whip and steel, and onward rush the maddening
horses, yelled at by ten thousand voices of a madder public—one—two—three are
in advance, and now four, and two yields to three, and one drops in rear of two,
and four toils desperately for the third place, and now—now—all is over, and the
winner of the Derby is—
Hallo, you scoundrel, give me that handkerchief ? How dare you snatch it from

A SCRAPE FOR THE STATUES.
KINGs and Queens, in their oxidised latten,”
Had for ages slept snug in the Abbey,
ll some snobs, with no relish for patin,t
Of late raised a cry of “How shabby”.
Hence a talk about stripping each statue
Of the coat of black dirt it had on,
And, straight, through the Times shot off at you,
flights of letters, some pro and some con /
But bold LAYARD has sanctioned a trial,
And PERCY declares in a letter
That an old lady of the blood royal
Has been scraped clean, and seems all the better.
When forth springs LAKE PRICE, with approval
Of §: 's reverend rust,
And kicks up, against dirt's removal,
What irreverent folks call a “dust.”
But WARD, R.A., 'tother way leans,
Is for cleansing the statues en masse,
And bringing our smirched Kings and Queens
Back to their original brass.
Now Punch has been leaving his card
On Henry The Seventh’s old mother:
The usage she’s had she thinks hard,
And begs they won’t rub-up another.
And .# all over the place,
It certainly must be confest,

pulchral Statues in metal.

More dirty-faced makes all the rest.
As you’ve polished up poor CountEss ANNE,
If you polished the whole royal crowd,
Though the statues might look spick and span,
The effect would be rather too loud!
And JoHN BULL would be apt to complain
If the Dean ordered “Down with the dust!”
Like MARTINUs SCRIBLERUs," in pain, .
When the nurse cleaned his shield from its rust.
Bright faces new Sovereigns may fit,
But old Sovereigns should be sacred things;
And Punch won't have disturbed—not a bit—-
The dirt, or the dust, of his Kings.

tions, the ancient shield, destined as a cradle for his son and heir, was ignorantly

TOUCHING HORSES” NAMES.
MR. PUNCH, - - -
I sha LL forsake the genteel but not very lucrative profession
to which I was brought up, and inaugurate a new one. I shall become
a Nomenclator. I shall advertise in all the newspapers, railway sta;
tions, railway, carriages, and omnibuses, and on every º wall
and hoarding in London, in compan with the “fixcelsior.” elocipede
and “Caraccas Cocoa,” that I will undertake, to supply appropriate
and original names, duly registered at Stationers' Hall to prevent piracy,
for racehorses, roses, greyhounds, pictures, pet.dogs, plays, novels,
new songs, waltzes, and Her Majesty's ships of war...I shall meet
a great want, and make a great fortune. My cha will be nominal,
but I shall stipulate for a liberal per-centage, to be determined by three
Commissioners º by the Government of the day, on all gains,
winnings, and profits, whether in specie or gold and silver plate, accru-
ing to those patrons benefited by my instructions. -
Can anyone doubt that I shalſ render a substantial service to English
nomenclature, who reflects on the clumsy and unsuitable names—tº
instance only one class of appellations—bestowed on those high-bred
and costly animals, the élite of which, now in their second season,
are at this present hour more . and talked about even than
the Irish Church or the American claims ? -
Let us run through a few of the most fashionable of the horses
engaged in this year's Derby, and try whether their names ring like
winning ones. -
Do you think Pero Gomez, whose colour ought to be Spanish chest-
nut—I halt for a moment, to remark that, as a rule, I should exclude
foreign names—likely to bring SIR. Joseph HAwLEY the luck again *
Do you fancy Perry Down—“Hey, derry down l’ must be the chorus
to the song of triumph if he is the victor P Can you imagine the whole
course shouting, “Ladas wins ! Ladas wins !” or “Ethus / Ethus /* *
Will you put your money on Bosworth, or Ryshworth, or De Were, or
Duke of Beaufort, or Thoricaldsen & Do you expect, that the cheer of
victory will greet any one of these horses about half-past three on the
afternoon of the 26th If you do, it can only be because you have
drawn him in a sweep.
Still, ye young gentlemen of England, who are going down to Epsom
with luncheons, and ladies at all times partial to putting questions, and
particularly so on such an eventful occasion as the Derby Day, which
makes so many of us think of “The Gloves of the Angels,” you will do
well to get up the histories of such of these hippic names as have any;
displaying, for example, your classical learning commenced at St. Scho-
lastica's, continued at Oxford, *g, on the Stock Exchange, and
now revived by the aid of DR. W. SMITH's excellent Classical Dic-
tionary, over Ladas, a performer who had a great run, a good many
years ago, at the Olympic (Games—not Theatre), but is not so sure of
fame at our Isthmian ones; and showing your acquaintance with
modern Art when you reach Thorwaldsen, who, you will explain, was
not a breeder or a trainer, but a celebrated Danish sculptor with an
European reputation, perhaps not destined to be increased at Epsom.
(May he not “chisel” his friends on Wednesday!) |
When you are asked about the horses which have good winner-like
names, be ready with an epitome of the life and adventures of the Young
Pretender, who once before got as far as Derby, and will not now
surprise his adherents if he makes good his claim to the crown of the
British–Turf, in which case you would regret that there was no FLORA
MACDONALD to compete with Scottish Queen in the Oaks (observe that
the fillies are generally better named than the colts). In Belladrum's
name does there not lurk the germ of a joke, for surely his backers
must hope that he was not made merely to be beaten?, Martyrdom,
as a Professorial friend, appositely remarks, immediately suggests a
stake; the Drummer...will heard of at Tatt(oo)enham Corner; and
another outsider, or “extern,” as, conventually speaking, he should be
called, Wagabond (one of the best names in the lot), will for this day
only not be interfered with by the Surrey County Police, or the Society
for the Suppression of Mendicity. Lastly, express your hope that no
one will be a beggar made by King Cophetua, or have reason to regret
that he did not rely more on his Alpenstock, or lament that he treated
Rupert too cavalierly. HIPPoCRATES, Junior.
Disappointing.
We see advertised “The new improved Baby, requires no feeding
and is warranted not to cry.” This is a real blessing to fathers an
mothers, and distracted lodgers—and to be had, too, for a few stamps;
but is it not rather cruel to offer to send the little dear by the post?
(Great blow to our hopes—“the new, improved Baby” we find is
only sh; so many actual babies are boasted to be—“a regular

To arts of dress—pins, rings, or blue tie.
Something more than
Hats or blacking can,
Which make the fop, and not the man.
An eye that's bright -
With youth's own eagle light,
And needs no “glass” for sight.

As was of old KING SAUL.

With a free step, uncowed,
With a high head, unbowed.
Tender to woman's tears,
Pity for maiden's fears,
Kind words for children's ears;
A true heart and clear head,
Yet not all Euclid-bred,
Or on stale classics fed;
One who can ride to hounds,
And loveth sylvan sounds,
But is not “horsy” without bounds;
One who can steer and scull,
A “biceps” that can pull
Up-stream a whole boat-full.
Yet with a soul and parts
For finer, gentler arts,
That live in noble hearts:
Qne who can rise and sing .
en maidens wake the string,
And softest cadence fling.
A fair, good name,
Perhaps no renown or fame,
At least no taint of shame.
A manly grace,
That looks you in the face
And owns to no disgrace.
Now, if Time knows
This him, for whose high brows
There waits my wreath of vows,
He that dares be
What these lines wish to see,
I seek no further—it is he
HLPPONOMY AND NOSOLOGY.
SoME controversy has been raised as to the original whence the
owner of Ethus derived that name for his horse. Nobody seems
to have disputed the derivation of Belladrum, which, nevertheless,
is open to some question. There is, in mosology, a term Tympanites,
which signifies a drum-like distention. In the popular tongue this
intumescence is denoted by a word which differs from Belladrum most
obviously by beginning instead of ending with drum. The only other
difference is that existing between the final vowel of Bella, and the
vowel, sometimes a consonant, with which the other word ends. Is it
#; that medical science suggested that modified inversion for the
* of Tympanites, which would form Belladrum, to the stable

CAWS—THE CAGE IS CLOSED FOR THE SEASON.—A FAREWELL.
John MoLE, SAM MoLE and Louis MoLE were the occupants of a
legal sanctum, “contiguous,” not to the “melancholy ocean”—with
my compliments to the ex-Premier—but to a stream of life running
*::::: along one of our great thoroughfares. - -
usiness of all sorts was transacted in the Molehill, from cases which
paid nothing to cases which were a fortune to Solicitors and Barristers,
and a joy to their undelings, every kind of respectable work found its
way in and out of the Moles' doors. Did anyone find himself suddenly
lugged into a County Court or Police Court, he sent for the youngest
MR. MoLE, who got him off, if getting off was possible. Were you
Plaintiff or Defendant at Common Law, MR. Mole the second would
so instruct some eminent Counsel on your behalf, that if the eminent
Counsel would only take the trouble to make himself master of his
brief, your success was certain. -
The Senior MoLE undertook Chancery matters, as became his age
and grave demeanour.
The name of Mole is a terror to uncivil cabmen; and I feel confi-
dent that the Juniorist MR. MoLE might walk through the most dis-
reputable thieves’ haunts unmolested, so strong is their superstition
concerning his power.
WAGG was going to consult the Second MR. MoLE one day on some
important business, and being in a hurry took a cab to within a yard of
the MEssRs. Mole's door. WAGG gave the man eighteen-pence. This
being precisely the sum to which the driver was entitled, he of course
descended from his perch, and assuming a defiant air, inquired with
one eye askant upon the shilling and sixpence in his right hand.
“Wot's this ; *
“What’s what?” returns WAGG, quietly, who knows London, and
is not to be bullied.
“Why this 'ere,” says the cabman, lashing himself up to fury pitch
on seeing that a crowd was rapidly collecting, in expectation of wit-
nessing a fight.
: That’s eighteen-pence,” answers WAGG, imperturbably.
“Well, it won't do,” bawls the cabman. As far as this goes he has
the crowd with him. None of them would evidently have taken
eighteen-pence for the job whatever it was.
“Why not?” asks WAGG, keeping his eye on cabman, and his hand
on his stick.
“Why not!” shouts the excited driver. “Cos it won’t. Here,
where’s your card–I ain't come no less than four mile o' ground—”
here he appeals to the public, who listen to him sympathisingly—“and
this 'ere won’t do. . 'Ere, where's your card?”
“Give me back the eighteen-pence,” says WAGG, kindly, “and you
may summon me.”
he crowd wavered, this wasn't a bad idea. How would the cabman
take it. It was getting exciting. .
“No, I sharn’t,” replies the man, decidedly. “You just 'and me
over your card, You oughtn't to go riding in cabs if you can't pay
wot's right... 'Ere, where's your card. You ain't no gentleman, you
ain’t. Ere, 'and over—”
“Now, don’t, you be impertinent, my man,” says WAGG, sharply.
The man thus addressed, makes a rough demonstration with his ſists
swears he ain’t impertinent, and again demands the card. The crow
becoming somewhat weary of the monotony, are closing in upon
WAGG, and one or two in the outer circle propose that the cabman
should pitch into him, and settle the matter that way off-hand.
At this instant a brilliant idea flashed across WAGG’s mind. He was
determined not to give another penny, and wasn’t going to give a card.
“Now look 'ere, and over that card—”. The cabman was just
beginning threateningly when WAGG interrupted him.
“You came from the top of Regent Street; well, my office is close
here. , Come with me, and we’ll see what the cab-fare is marked on the
Regulation List.”
...Qh, yes,” returns the Cabman, ironically, “where is your office?”
“Here,” answers. WAGG, quietly pointing to the Moles' door–
MoLE & SON-I think, you know me,” he adds with an impressive
glance at the irate vagabond.
“MoLE & Son,” repeats the Cabman, as if he could scarcely believe
his ears, while the crowd, as if expecting legal proceedings against
them individually and collectively, begins to break itself up and slink
away.
WAGG goes to the door, and produces his own latch-key. Seeing
this the Cabman accomplishes the ascent to his box with even greater
alacrity than had marked his jumping off it, and venting his ill-
humour on the tumble-down animal in the shafts, drives without so
much as an audible grumble, out of reach of MoLE & Co.
So much is in their name, so much is in their power.
These good people gave Goosey a lift, and the DoRMICE had given
y
him a start. With a lift and a start, the young gentleman working
assiduously, managed in the course of a few years to jump into some
sort of practice, which went on increasing, to the great joy of the
LITTLE DUCK, who had not at first found swimming against the stream
quite so easy a matter as the Enthusiastic Goose before marriage
would "ave had her believe.
As for our old friend BARNDoor, the SPRATTs still gather round his
table, or rather round her table, for the old gentleman married his
young musical protégée, who has led him a delicious life ever since, and
serve him right.
.LITTLE Cock Roby Ns dines there occasionally, and comes awa
pitying his host. Even he prefers picking up his crumbs elsewhere, if
it can be done; and, indeed, he is, now-a-days, not sorry to accept an
invitation at the shortest notice from that rising young Barrister,
MR. Goosey BARNDoor, who “suddenly made a heap of money, Sir,”
Cock Roby Ns informs us, “by being put into the Railway business in
the Committee Rooms—before the new regulations, Sir, by Jove.”
Whereat Cock Roby Ns is as pleased as are Goosey’s best friends, for
he can’t afford to know a poor man, and the prosperity of an acquain-
tance enrols, as it were, the little bird as a member of another first-
rate London Club.
The MACAws of Macaw vanished. They gave larger and larger
parties — grander and grander, louder and louder, until one fine
morning there was a burst and a bang, and whether they were shot,
or whether they took flight and flew away in the smoke that ac-
companied the report, nobody knows, but a great many }. care.
It was said that they were not Macaws at all, but only old Rooks, who
had pecked a bird of rare plumage to death and flaunted it bravely in
his feathers.
Pigeons cried, and were comforted by Hawks; and the small birds,
who had suffered, appealed to legislation to protect them for the future
against the consequences of their own folly.
What more ?
Much—but not at present. Go to the Zoological Gardens, and
there draw your Sunday Moral from the Birds, Beasts, and Fishes
now On WleW.
For the present I draw the night-covering over my Happy Family,
and shut up the Cage.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I remain, yours,
(Concluded.)
WAN HuMBUg.
LANDLORDS AND LODGERS.
THE Peers, with ever adverse will,
Injustice to undo,
Out of their House, LoRD Townshend's Bill
Protecting Lodgers, threw.
The Irish Romanists are strong;
The British Lodgers weak:
Those first they’ll grant redress of wrong,
But leave these last to seek.
This rule it seems their Lordships use
In practice to apply;
Do all the right you daren't refuse:
Do none you dare deny.
DUKES AND DUFFERS.
WHAT sort of a Duke was he that kept a fool who, once upon a
time, trimmed his cap with strawberry leaves? No such Duke as any
modern Scotch one. The ducal SAwNEY is no fool. Sacrifices senti-
ment to siller. . Lets the shooting of his estates to the best bidder.
Cherishes no feudal nonsense about game. In a practical, business
way is destroying all stupid reverence for all such tradition in regard
to sport as that which Scott glorified in his verse on the occasion
“When in the cleugh the buck was ta'en.”
Teaches his enlightened people, and all others whom he can influence,
to value such an animal in such a place as a buck in a cleugh, by just
the same standard as he would a pig in a stye. Does not exhibit
himself in invidious contrast to the new landed interest of successful
traders. Does his utmost to discredit the fallacy that noblesse oblige
—the delusion, indeed, that there is any such quality as noblesse in the
nature of noblemen; to demonstrate, in fact, that the idea of noblesse
is all humbug. Understanding the spirit of the age, accepting the
times, he has exchanged the spirit of chivalry for that of commerce,
Should only, for rents' sake, take care that excessive preservation of
me does not ruin his tenants, and must be prepared to hear people
i. the abolition of the hereditary privileges of Peers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
McNEILE TO GLADSTONE.
As a Protestant Dean, to protest is my right:
As an Irishman born, I’ve a mission to fight:
As a preacher of peace, I bid all hold their tongue,
And list, while my curse at the Papists is flung.
You are deaf to remonstrance, and hardened 'gainst ruth,
But still 'tis my duty to tell you the truth:
So just read my letter, and say how you feel
When you’ve swallowed two columns of red-hot McNEILE.
You talk of equality—ass that you are
As if Papist and Protestant could be at par!
As if the sole question were not, and must be,
“Shall I keep down the Papist, or he keep down me?”
And why to the wall he, and not I, should go,
'Tis my duty by Christian reasons to show:
Not that you Christian reasons are likely to feel—
But such are the reasons that weigh with McNEILE.
Imprimis, I take it for granted, you know
#. view of the Papists, expressed long ago;
When Liverpool shook, as I laid down the law,
And defied Priest or Pope in my proofs to find flaw—
That Papists are tricksters, and traitors, and thieves:
That none of them ever says what he believes :
That their faith makes the Irish to cheat, lie, and steal,
And be blackguards—as sure as my name is 'McNeilº.
That the seven deadly sins are summed up in a priest:
That the clerical tonsure's the mark of the beast:
That their Pope is the red Babylonian fye-ſye:
His tiara a fool's cap, his cross-keys a lie :
That their preaching and teaching lead straight to the pit :
That in devilish conclave their canonists sit,
Forging fetters for Protestants—soul, head and heel,
And fashioning faggots to roast HUGH McNEILE.
That Protestant landlords Priests view in the light
Of victors in wars waged in justice's spite :
That to tenants, as landlords de jure, they hint,
That the landlords de facto have no right to rint.
That if they distrain, and the wrong'd tenant like,
There's worse sins than a shot from the back of a dyke:
That theirs is no theft, who from heretics steal,
And that 's Papist morals, say I, HUGH McNEILE!
If you tell me the question ’s not “Which Church shall rule?”
But “If Law shan’t rule both **—I reply, you’re a fool.
If you call for the proof that confession and mass
Lead to shooting of landlords—I say, you’re an ass.
If you ask “How its jaws Canon Law’s to outstretch,
And swallow up Common & " I say, you’re a wretch.
That this proves my thesis, I hope you will feel,
And allow me to write, Q.E.D., Hugh McNEILE.
A SHOT AT THE GUN CLUB.
PARLIAMENT has shown its sense as well as its humanity by passing
a good law for the prevention of cruelty to Sea-birds. But there are
certain land-birds, also, that are cruelly ill-treated, and have claims
Upon humanity, although Parliament is not unlikely to forget them.
Not to speak of the poor skylarks imprisoned in small cages in our
noisy, London streets, where they sing their little souls out in sighing
for their liberty, what think you, Honourable Gentlemen, of the
thousands of poor pigeons, which are slaughtered every season by your
honourable selves and fellow members of the Gun Club?, Would it
not be kind to establish by an Act of your collective wisdom a close
time for these birds as well as partridges and pheasants * The Spring
is pairing time for pigeons as for indolent M.P.'s, and yet the meetings
of the Gun Club are held mostly at that season, and hecatombs of
“blue rocks” are annually sacrificed, that certain noble sportsmen (?)
may win a few bank-notes.
Moreover, Mr. Punch has heard from an eye-witness of one of these
day's sport (?) that wounded birds are often left to welter in their
blood, and at times a half-hour passes before some one takes the
trouble to put them out of misery, and wring their pretty necks. This
is not a pleasant thought to entertain of noble sportsmen, nor can
their happy shooting grounds, bestrewed with blood and feathers, be a
vastly pleasant sight. Yet ladies, it is whispered, sometimes go to see
the slaughter, and applaud successful shooters, without feeling any pity
for the pigeons that are shot.
“THE DOUBLE EVENT.”—Twins!
THEATRICAL PROTECTIONISTS.
WAL, Punch, old hoss, I guess as hedw you Britishers air A singing
pritty small now SUMNER hev fired into you. ... Four hundred million
sterling is a biggish lump of money, toe shell out, and JoHN BULL
must pull his horns in, and give up givin' dinners afore he’ll find the
needful. And besides the Alabama, there’s another little claim, I
guess, he’ll hev to settle. See what ses our Tribune :-
“Our native and naturalised actors and actresses are in imminent peril of
their professional life. The inroads of English companies are taking a shape
which seems to denote systematic organisation and a determination to check
the growth, if not to strike at the root, of American dramatic art. Already,
in this city, half a dozen theatres are occupied almost exclusively by foreign
erformers, and others shine only by the light of European stars. The evil is
itterly complained of, and protection is loudly called for. Protection should
be afforded. º offers inferior articles at cheap prices; managers bargain
at wholesale, and retail to the public with immense profit; and American
histrionic industry is crowded out of the market.”
Applesquash and airthquakes it’s enough to rile a skunk toe see
our Stage. A trampled under foot by foreign talent. Keep your stars
to shine at home, where you’re in need of some enlightenment, or we
shalſhev to snuff'em out, as we would a two-cent rushlight. Euro-
pians may think 'em fine, but Yankees aint Europians, and their tastes
% superior. This is what the Tribune ses, and Ises ditto toe the
tºrtune :-
“The commonest American artisan, the meanest mechanic, is shielded from
unfair foreign rivalry; the actor, almost alone, stands undefended, painters
are protected and sculptors. Poets are not, but that is the fault of the copy-
right law, and not of the tariff. The most popular art of all is left by a
thoughtless government to take care of itself. In what manner, and to what
amount, duties might be imposed upon foreign players, it is not our province
to determine. The scale would probably be settled by professional rank and
* lines' of business. Upon every individual a sufficient sum should be levied
to make it necessary for him to demand the same salary an American actor of
the same degree would receive. A tariff revision is the one thing needed
to save the native profession from impending doom.”
A tax on “heavy fathers” would pay well, if a heavy one; and I’d
come down heavy tew upon your light comedians. But I’d go further
than the Tribune, and claim a compensation for the damage as our
Stage already hev sustained through foreign importations. Not being
bright at figgers, I'll jist drop a line to SUMNER, and git him toe make
out a little bill against JoHN BULL for injuring our players. Guess
he’ll find it as well founded as our Alabama claim, and will be as easy
bullied into paying it. -
Wal, writing’s thirsty work, so I'll jist go and put myself outside
of an eye-opener.
Yours, old hoss, as formerly,
JoNATHAN MARCELLUs Josh GoLIAH GoNG.
*** Without questioning the statement that †† actors are per-
forming “at cheap prices” upon the New York stage, might not
England plead a set-off in this case for compensation, on the ground
that New York actors have been highly paid in London But Leah,
Lord Dundreary, and dear old Rip Jºan Winkle have come and left such
pleasant memories behind them, that we would gladly, welcome any
similar competitors with native English actors upon the English stage.
Grandiloquence for Bumbledom.
IT might'please the fancy of Westrymen, Churchwardens, Overseers,
and other such officials, to assimilate domestic and parochial to foreign
and diplomatic cant, and, by way of a beginning, instead of . local
self-government,” for the future always say “topical autonomy.”
Armed Peace.

What cause with anxious care has marked your brow.
A sum upon the wrong horse have you lost,
Or are you in the tender passion crossed ?
Jones. Not yet my Book miscalculation knows,
Nor have I jilted been, as you suppose.
No ; on the contrary, the truth to say,
The dresses all are made, and named's the day.

And from your bargain would you fain retire *
'Tis true that MABEL's charms much MAUD's excel:
And do I talk to an inconstant Swell ? -

An Eclogue.
RITUALISM ON THE TURF.
THE readers of the Record are probably not many of them accustomed
to the perusal of Sporting Intelligence, but will doubtless be interested,
if not excited, by the following extract from a letter of “ARGUs"
relative to a horse-race at Salisbury:-
“The Wilton Stakes was won very cleverly by High Church, whose success
was hailed with a good deal of pleasure by all the Ritualists present on the
course. She was bred by SIR Lydston NewMAN, and, being a Newminster,
was named High Church by your Correspondent, and I hope the appellation
will meet with the approbation of Lond WINchilseA.”
It will be evident to that serious class of the community above
indicated, that the Ritualis's are very fast filling up the measure of
their iniquities. From ecclesiastical pastimes they have advanced to
actual sport, and now attend not only matins, mass, and vespers, but
races, insomuch that there was what American journalism calls “quite
a number” of them upon the Salisbury race-course; and they all re-
joiced in the success º horse named High Church / What is this but
downright horse-worship, at which they have at last arrived from
Romish idolatry P
“ARGUs’ proceeds :—
“I may add also that a filly out of the dam of High Church by Crater, is
coming up at the forthcoming sale of the Mamhead yearlings, and from what
I recollect of her, she is well worth looking at.”
The passage last quoted will doubtless be read with horror in Exeter
Hall, as a fearful sample of the phraseology of self-convicted Ritualistic
reprobates. ... Now that Ritualists have taken to the Turf, they will
perhaps additionally outrage evangelical feelings by a new modification
of costume, adjoining to the characteristic M. B. waistcoat a coat and
trousers of a horsey cut, to which might be prefixed the same initials;
the B signifying the monosyllable synonymous with animal, as applied
to that noble animal the Horse.
SEA BIRDs (to be carefully preserved).-The Flying Squadron.
A CASE OF BADGER-BAITING.
“BRock” in the dialect of the North means “badger.” . The Rev.
W. BRock, rector of Bishop's Waltham, is acting up to his name as
well as his nature when he badgers MR. GLADston E. His letter is
about the richest specimen of Clerical Billingsgate ever, penned, and
that is saying a great deal. “Under the name of Liberality, MR.
GLADSTONE,” writes the reverend gentleman, “is abusing his power to
put down the Protestant religion and the liberties of England.” But
thousands and tens of thousands of true Protestants in England are
determined to expose and crush his conspiracy against the faith and
freedom of the Empire. The time may not be far distant when “the
vile person” (i. e., M.R. GLADSTONE) shall no more be called Liberal.
The Rev. W. BRock is much mistaken if this last act of GLAD-
STONE's, undertaken at the bidding of his priestly masters, does not
speedily bring his measures and his Ministry to a bad end. GLADstoNE
is committing sacrilege. GLADSTONE is teaching the people of this
country to lie and to steal. GLADSTONE is suborning our Gracious
QUEEN to perjury.
It will be a consolation to the REv. W. BROCK, before he ministers
at the Lord's table on the day he writes, “to have lifted up his humble
voice thus publicly against the sin of GLADstoNE.”
But the most awful threat is to come. The REv. M.R. BRock means
to take steps to send copies of his letter, when printed, to both Houses of
Parliament /
It will be a comfort to our readers to know that when we last
i. at Carlton House Terrace, the badgered GLADSTONE was as
well as could be expected. -
The REv. W. BRock begins his letter by reminding GLADSTONE that
it is an old trick of the Jesuits to choose good names for doing the
i; things: and that (he adds) is just what the Government is now
ong.
Mr. Punch will close his article by reminding the REv. W. BRock
that it is an old trick of parsons in a passion to choose bad names for
doing the best things—and that is just what the Rev. W. BRock is
now doing. It must be a comfort, to him to feel that in this, as in all
else, he is in direct opposition to the Jesuits.
THE SWEETS OF OFFICE LIFE.
“I would I were a boy again, a free and happy boy!” is a senti-
ment familiar to most after-dinner singers. But one would hardly feel
a yearning to recommence one's boyhood, if one there with had the
prospect of three years of youthful slavery, such as this advertiser offers
in a newspaper at Leeds:—
ANTED, in an Office, as Correspondent and Shorthand Clerk, a
Youth under 20 years of age. He must, as Correspondent, write a good
commercial hand, and as Shorthand Clerk must be able to write to dictation
at the rate of from 90 to 120 words per minute. Office hours 8:30 A.M. to
7 P.M., Saturdays to 3 P.M. He must find sureties for £150 at once, and at
his own expense, and enter into a 3 years' engagement at following wages:
first year, 18s, per week; second year, 22s. per week; third year, 28s, per
week. One with some knowledge of mechanical drawing preferred. State
references in reply to Box * * Post Office, Leeds.
“I would I were a bird,” or any sort of living creature, rather than
myself, must surely be the aspiration of any poor young fellow, whose
poverty and not his will consents to let him take a situation such as
this. A poor young fellow must indeed be pitiably poor if he be forced
to work hard daily for ten hours and a half, and receive but threepence.
halfpenny an hour for his work. A clerk who is to act as correspondent
in an office, and, moreover, to write shorthand at the rate above
recorded, must be worth a little more than the wages of an errand-boy;
and if he knows something of “mechanical drawing,” he had better
turn his knowledge of mechanics to account by drawing somewhere
else a better salary than that of eighteen shillings for threescore hours
weekly of work for such a skinflint as this advertiser seems.
A Slight Confusion.
MRs. MALAPROP, who is growing just a little deaf, on hearing a
friend read out from the paper something about “the last Encyclical
and Syllabus of the Holy Father,” observed that, good Protestant as
she was, she should like to taste that syllabub.

PUNCH*S DERBY PROPHECY.
“Nothing can dome good. I should be quite happy if anything could do me
harm,” remarks a blasé young aristocrat in one of MR. DISRAELI's best novels. In
the same spirit Mr. Punch wishes that he could sometimes be wrong, instead of
being so invariably and inevitably right on all subjects in this distracted orb.
Somebody ostracised ARIsTIDEs, being wearing of hearing him called the Just.
Punch the Just thinks of ostracising himself (only oysters are out of season), tired
with incessant tributes to his wisdom. Spare your compliments, dear Universe, and
let him be. His Derby Prophecy? Well, he prophesied, of course, that Pretender
would be first, Pero Gomez second, and the Drummer third. And, equally of course,
they were so declared to be by MR. CLARK. “Let him go–handsome is that hand-
some does,” he remarked of the latter horse—“let him go, the rather that he can
stay.” Of Pero he said, with playful jingle, “Pero may be at zero, yet be quick-
silver still.” His prediction of Pretender was so plain that nobody could mistake for
a moment—he blessed the horse, introduced him to BELINDA, and then named him
winner with what is absurdly called an oath, borrowed from LADY STRANGr. The
anecdote which he took from MR. G. A. SALA “seemed to have no connection with
the other sentences"—so wrote humble inquirers. Why—you idiots—that was just
it. He inserted it, apropos of nothing, for those who had eyes to see. When
Mr. Punch not only names a horse, but names him, swearingly, ye must be dull
indeed to doubt his meaning. “Pretender, and be — to you." It might not be
civil, but it was concise, and clear. Happy are those who plucked the sweet nut
out of the rough shell. With what exquisite accuracy he described the finish of the
race (a splendid one, though the pace was slow) observe by comparing the accounts
of the scene, the rather that none of them agrees with any of the others. Well,
your Prophet hopes you were all happy. It was a lovely day, and the PRINCEss of
WALEs was present, and Punch had told you how to bet. What more could you
want in the way of terrestrial happiness? Now, his wearied lips he'll close, Leave,
O leave him to repose—until May 1870. Valete et plaudite.

Thursday’s list—rather a short one; sometimes we have a yard of such
rubbish. The stupidest letters from correspondents—and the depth of
their stupidity is frequently abyssmal—were more acceptable than such
a catalogue of opinions by people of whom nobody ever heard before,
and of whom everybody hopes never to hear again.
The Alabama Papers were promised in a few days. They are now
without interest, Mr. Punch's Falstaff Cartoon having not only settled
the question of American, demand, but having so worked upon the
affectionate nature of the Americans, that MR. MoTI.EY is instructed
to ask LoRD CLARENDON whether we should not like a few hundred
millions of dollars, and to insist on our accepting Cuba, which is to be
immediately conquered for us. -
We then got into MR. Lowe’s Budget. Most of the cats which he
let out of this bag are sleek and pleasing creatures, welcome to our
hearths, but there is one ugly big black beast which was a good deal
chivvied to-night. -
In other words, the more people look upon the amiable proposal that
they should pay Five 3. of Income-Tax in one year (that is the
requisition, and the Governor of the Bank of England himself told
MR. Lowe so), the less they all like it. It does not matter whether they
like it or not, because Parliament has enacted that they shall pay, but
MR. Lowe might just as well spare our feelings, and not try to per-
suade us that É. is four. The grave men in the House, who can do
sums without pencils, and who have had plenty of time to look at the
Fº smiled sardonically at MR. Low E's clever juggling (vide
ormer Čartoon), and seemed to think that he had better take his
money, and not affect to fancy that it was only the regular thing. If
Mr. Punch has any friends to whom money is an object, he advises
them to begin putting away Income-Tax in a Savings' Bank, as the
collector will be down on them for an awful lump in January next as
ever is, proximo. - -
But this was nothing compared to the profane way in which MR.
Low E and others talked of the Bank of England and the Money
Market. The man who had been heard to speak º of the
Equator was pious compared to these speakers. MR. Low E said that
the Money Market might take care of itself, and it was not the busi-
ness of Government to cocker up the Bank of England, a private
banking institution, and help it to assist trades and hoist storm signals.
The Governor of the Bank, MR. CRAwFURD, Liberal Member for the
City, expressed his great regret at the indifference which the Chan-
cELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER showed to the value of the function
exercised by the Bank. “Function,” applied to the Bank, is, Mr.
Punch takes it, derived from “funk.”
MR. Lowe said one thing on which it is Mr. Punch's intention to
act. He observed that a man is happy if he is able to do his duty, and
does his duty, by one set of people. This is a noble and moral senti-
ment, and Mr. }} who is attached to his family almost to a fault,
designs to carry it out. He means to do his duty to that set of people
as far as a beautiful country house for the Summer, many garden
parties, a yacht, an expedition to Nº. an opera box (grand tier),
and a private band may contribute to the happiness of “that set.”
There is another set whom he will not attempt to do his duty by ; but
if, when MR. Lowe's five quarters of Income-Tax shall have been paid,
there is any surplus at the bankers, why they may call and ascertain
whether at some future time Mr. Punch may take their demands into
consideration.
We got through the Budget, Lord Mayors—no, Brood Mares, are not
to be taxed, and we had a debate on the Pensions Act, only noteworthy
because MR. FAwcETT was again in opposition to MR. GLADston E,
who, however, said that he did not in the slightest degree resent that
course. Finally, when we were on Beer-Houses, MR. HENLEY wanted
a definition of the words “a notoriously bad character.” Some per-
sons, he said, would call a man that, if he were a teetotaller—some if he
beat his wife—some if he were seen with a pipe in his mouth. As
regards the first sort, Mr. Punch thinks that a man is rather foolish
than bad who denies himself wholesome liquor in moderation. Beating
his own wife, beadle, devil, and everybody, he is not called upon to
which illustrated his proceedings, and there the matter might as
well have dropped. But MR. CHARLEY, who is a vehement Anti-
Gladstonian, told the story, and pointed a moral. As Government
was, he said, desirous of conciliating Rome, and looked upon Educa-
tion as one of the three heads of the Protestant Upas Tree, MR.
CHARLEY wished to know whether M.R. GLADSTONE meant to do away
with the National Education system, or whether he would protect the
humbler Catholics against their priests. MR. G. MooRE made an
excuse for LAVELLE, and MR. GLADSTONE said that Government had
no desire to conciliate Rome, except by doing justice. A Ministry
composed, for the most part, of zealous defenders of the National
System, was not likely to wish to destroy it. In these days of slip-
slop, it is comforting to read so exquisitely neat a sentence as that with
which the PREMIER ended: “What we have to ask is whether the law
works, whether the officers of the law do their duty, and whether the
ends of the law are attained, and it does not appear to me that the
Honourable Gentleman has affirmed the negative of any one of these
propositions.”
Patents and Poor-Laws occupied the rest of the night which followed
the most hideous Oaks day ever witnessed. We believe that there
were no human beings on the course, but that the animals got up the
race among themselves, and that Brigantine herself telegraphed to say
that she had won.

THE DULNESS OF THE DERBY.
SPEAKING of the Derby Day, a “special” writer says:—
“Freaks of riotous misconduct were far fewer than is usual, and on the
whole there has been seldom seen a duller coming from the Derby.”
“Come, gentle dulness,” shall be our invocation when we next
venture to the Derby: that is, if by dulness is meant absence from
brutality. Jolly dogs may think it dull not to get drunk, and black-
guard cads and roughs ... there is no fun in going to the
Derby unless, they can fling beer-bottles about as they come foº, or
fire, volleys of foul chaff at the ears of decent people. Blackguardism
such as this is neither jollity nor fun, but simply riotous misconduct;

“Modern Chignons give a truly frightful shape to female heads. Any idea of the

of loops and of crépés. All the charm of a coiffure is lost as soon as one sees
nothing but artificial tresses in those curls and bandeaux, put on as ornaments, but
suddenly becoming an object of real repulsion.”
What queer ideas of beauty must any woman have, who can put on a big
chignon, and fancy it an ornament She might just as fitly wear a false
hump on her back, and imagine it enhanced the graces of her figure. A

I HEARD a Ploughman o'er the Lea,
I do not know where that may be,
Singing a song. Thus he began:
I’d be a butterfly. Poor man!
Why should I cry, Poor man, like winking
Because that song set me a thinking -
And, perched upon a new hewn trunk,
Here is exactly what I thunk:
This man to providence demurs,
And his own ways he far prefers;
For though an honest ploughman, he
A gaudy butterfly would be.
The thought to me itself presented-
“This worthy man is discontented.”
He has to work, he has to toil, .
To make his children's kettle boil:
He, discontented with his wittle,
Bewails his lot—I mean his little.

I am the butterfly: and—discontented P
Am I contented with my lot,
Quite satisfied with what I’ve got;
Am I, let’s see, or am I not,

We’ll take our fill of rural joys;
Leaving the town, like CINCINNATUS,
Who took his otium diggin tators.
(That is, I’ll pay the proper men
To hoe and sow; say, gardeners ten.)
I do not ask a single pound,
Nor carriage; no, nor horse nor hound:
Only a house that’s truly rural,
And all the others—in the plural.
Upon my word I do not care
To be a princely millionnaire:
Give me my modest house and grounds,
With but ten hundred thousand pounds.
I would not envy Lords or Deans,
Or sigh for aught beyond my means.
Yet I can rough it, if there are

Until eleven o'clock shall strike,
When let me eat just what I like.
Then tea again at half-past four,

Until the humble dinner-bell—
A sound you know and love so well:
Or when may be the Chinese gong,
With thundering voice cries “Come along”—

Dinner is served—and down you go to dine.
Give me enough : I need no sumptuous feast,
Except such little luxuries at least
As are but luxuries beyond a doubt.
And as for necessaries—I’ll do without.
To Fate I make this delicate presentment,
Owning that Happiness is in Contentment.
And this Contentment with your settled lot
Is to want nothing that you haven’t got.
And so True Happiness, depend upon’t,

when they meet in the street, and shake hands in friendship. And
Mr. Punch is only too happy to announce anything that may spread
the renown of his friend ; Doctor. In that spirit he begs to promul-
gate the fact that DR. CUMMING, having again consulted omens,
maintains that we are coming to the end of all things. Last Wednesday
he said, at Manchester, that—
“We must expect in our midst convulsions the most stupendous; changes
the most rapid; evolution of scenes the most startling; the disappearance of
the Crescent; the restoration of the Jew. Another sign was the wasting and
destruction of the great Western apostacy. But he did not expect to see the
Pope destroyed at once.”
We are very glad of this; for though Popery has no deadlier foe
than Punch, the present, head of the Catholic Church is rather, a
favourite with him, and he would be very sorry to think that His

WULGARIANS AT THE PLAY.
OUR Tory Contemporary, the Globe, which we beg leave to congra-
tulate upon its re-assuming the lively and readable character that it
bore when under the sway of Military Omniscience, has published a
letter, on theatrical matters, one paragraph from which epistle Mr.
Punch purposeth to reproduce. The writer, who signs himself CHRIS-
TOPHERO g: we presume as a discontent spectator of certain per-
formances, believes that they would be better if private boxes and stalls
were swept away, and authors and actors were brought close to the
educated audience, which he thinks, would (moderate prices being
demanded), take the place of ignorant swell-dom. This is matter of
opinion, and CHRISTOPHERo has much to say for his...But there cannot
be two opinions about the absolute justice of the following observa-
tions. ving characterised a performance as rubbish, MR. SLY says:
“That it is rubbish is not much excuse for the very numerous vulgarians
who go to the private boxes to talk and laugh; or for the “swells' who, after
a late dinner, yawn in the stalls, or still more offensively chatter there with
the paintings from the academy of the demi-monde. They need not manifest
so openly their unconcern with the business of the stage, for it is quite certain
that they do not know whether they are witnessing good acting or bad. But
this is detail; it is piteously§. however, by the poor actors, who ask how
it is possible for them to put their hearts into their work, while they catch every
word of the noisy flirtations in the º: boxes, and see that the stalls are
yawning? Here I interpolate a tribute to the highest personage but one in
the kingdom. The PRINCE of WALEs sets an admirable example.
no talking in his box. He attends to the performance, such as it is, with
the real courtesy which kindly recognises an attempt to please. He has seen
plenty of continental acting, before real audiences, but never allows English
actors to feel that they suffer by the comparison, which must be inevitable.
Flunkeydom might take the hint.”
Mr. Punch has frequently pointed with his bâton at offenders of the
kind indicated by MR. C. SLY., But the offence is so much on the in-
crease that one of these days the baton will be used in another way—
meantime, let “vulgarians” accept this re-printed paragraph as
warning. Mr. Punch adds a bow to H.R.H., and rejoices in indorsing
the Christopherian tribute.

NIGHTSHADE AND NIGHTSHADE.
MR. PUNCH,
THE Pall Mall Gazette quotes from the Liv ! Mercury an
account of a case of poisoning by the undersi † attributed to
another. According to this narrative, a man pulled a root out of the
ground, mistook it for a carrot, ate a piece of it, was presently seized
with convulsions, and died within ten minutes. “The plant proved to
be the Deadly Nightshade, Solanum Dulcamara.” Sir, the Solanum.
Dulcamara is not the Deadly Nightshade. It is the bittersweet, or
woody nightshade, no more a poison than the potato—a mere simple.
Your friend, DR. buicº, derived his name from that member of
the Solanaceae. It promotes the functions of the skin, liver, and
kidney, as one of#. young men can tell you from personal experi-
ence; and, your fair readers who want to be fairer may like to know, it
makes a cosmetic potion better than anything advertised, to remove
tan, pimples, freckles, discolorations, bubukles, and whelks, and knobs,
and flames of I form a eosmetic lotion, and I dilate the º:
Therefore a preparation of me is used by silly women to give what
they call expression to their eyes. Solanum Dulcamara is only a
distant relation of mine, and has none of my powerful properties... I
am the deadly nightshade. Ha! haſ I represent Medea in, the
Vegetable Kingdom—see her picture in the Royal Academy. Exhibi-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UP IN A BALLOON.
[THE report as to the great balloon, which so suddenly broke from
its moorings last week, having as yet alighted anywhere, is, if our
valued Scientific Correspondent is to be believed, not strictly in accor-
dance with the facts of the case. It is still somewhere above, and we
have despatched messengers in every direction in order to pick up |f
such scraps of intelligence as may be dropped by our highly-valued
scientific friend, during his most remarkable at: voyage, which will
mark an epoch in the history of balloon navigation. Ed.]
First Day.—Alone on the ocean of air—how did I come here? Per
varios casus per tot (pretty word tot)—per tot discrimina rerum tendimus
in latitudes ſº unattempted.
I went to the Gardens—I saw the Balloon., I had longed for the
opportunity—it had come at last. Provided with instruments for
taking and making observations, and with my well-stored luncheon-
basket purchased for the Derby—that Derby which I was not to see—
I approached the Car. . . -
In vain the enterprising Lessee of Cremorne implored me not to
attempt the ascent, at least without paying a sovereign down.
“SM-TH,” said I, sternly, “you do not know your man, when you
thus try to dissuade me.”..
He swore by the rim of his hat, turned up heavenwards, that I should
not go. -
His myrmidons (the Myrmidons were the followers of Agamemnon,
§ may recollect; they now follow SM-TH) would have restrained me.
y science—I am scientific in more ways than one–set their puny
efforts at defiance.
Flooring them right and left I sprang into the Car, and in another
instant the rope strained to, its utmost tension, snapped in Twain like
twopenny Twine (Do you like alliteration? I do), and the Giant shot
up into mid-air, with the force as of a cricket-ball, from a catapult of a
hundred horse-power.
SM-TH fainted. His last cry was for Cremorne Sherry. I heard it
and smiled. In a second I was smiling at nothing in the azure sky.
I write this as I sit in the Car. I shall jot down my diary and
observations, and drop them, addressed to you, with a request on the
envelopes that they may be forwarded, in the interests of science, to
your Office, at once.
I look over the side—nothing. Farewell Earth—farewell planet
of my birth—farewell revolutionary body. Ercelsior /
7 P.M.–Rising. Atmosphere gradually more rarefied. Proceeding
easily in W.W. º W.E. direction. (If this is any use to the Post-
office authorities let them know, as any letter forwarded per another
balloon would reach me.)
730–Mercury in the bulb up to something. ... I have just passed the
reparations for a new comet—they will not be perfect for another
j. ears. The Comet, on close inspection, resembles a kite of
peculiar form, with a magnificent tail. The tail is formed of luminous
nebulae. When these are sufficiently weighty, it descends so as to
trail across the earth and other planets. There is no danger, except
from the tail being over-weighted. In this latter case the comet would
be pulled down and would come into sharp collision with the Globe. I
do not, from what I have observed, think that there is any danger of
such a contingency for some time to come.
8–Glass down to 20. By careful manipulation I have just managed
to let the Balloon down sixty miles, and thus increase the temperature.
By the aid of my powerful glass I can see the people below. They are
pointing me out to each other, and from what I can gather from the
movement of their lips, are describing me to one another as SM-TH.
|We have received an independent statement from Gretna. The
mistake was as our esteemed Correspondent rightly imagined. The
memorandum forwarded to the office ran thus:–
Gretna. 8 p.m. E. T. SM-TH just passed over here. Not spoken with.
Subsequent telegrams of a similar nature, from other places still
further north, tend to confirm this mistaken notion, which we at once
hasten to correct. Ed.]

in a Balloon, there is no danger.
Time flies apace. I like to enjoy a siesta for a quarter of an hour,
and then con over a few chapters of a novel. Say L’Homme qui Rit.
I have the Gentleman’s Magazine with me.
The moon has risen beneath me, and the stars are muddled about

Sinking. Sinking. Sinking. By simply using weights and counter:
weights, and withdrawing the Balloon's sails and the “current ropes”
—(do you understand Balloon tackle P No?—well then, take my word
or it)—I can so control the “Gerent coil” as to allow the body of
the car to exert a pressure downwards, which may be with almost
mathematical precision expressed algebraically by
a. * (a + b) c' = abcd (m + n)"
allowing as much for cosines, as would reduce the opposing forces of
air-currents to a mere logarithmetical value.
This process has hitherto been but little understood by Aéronauts,
and indeed I believe that I am the first to, at all events, avail myself of
this most useful discovery.
945–I am in daylight again. The Antipodes, including America,
Asia, China, and some undiscovered Continents, of which I shall at
once proceed to make a map. By what races they may be peopled I
cannot, at this distance, determine. -
A propos of races, if you get this in time, take twenty to one in
thousands against Belladrum. Do it for me. I authorise you. Also
put in some lotteries for me at a guinea a ticket. I shall be down again
soon. I’ll lay against Pretender. Do it.
10:30. A Welsh rabbit I had with me here became suddenly cooked.
The chicken in my hamper is broiled. We are too near the Southern

I am somewhat nervous about the action of the Solar rays at this
proximity upon the soda-water and champagne.
I look over the side. China, I think.
People pointing me out to one another. Their lips form the same
word as did theirs in Scotland. It’s very annoying to be taken for

received corroborating our highly-valued Contributor’s statements:—
Pekin. E. T. SM-TH just passed over here. Wind S.E. by E.
Knew him by his hat. Ed.]
Do correct this erroneous impression on receipt of my communication.
I shall re-ascend to-night twice, as I need rest sadly. I have brought
my wellins cap to fold over my ears, which will serve me for the
night.
I now understand the people's mistake. I have just taken off my
hat in order to replace it by the aforesaid cap. It bears inside the
initials E.T.S., and is very much turned up at the brim. It was
changed in the scuffle before I leapt into the Car.
By a simple, scientific process I re-ascend and anchor off Taurus.
There are festivities going on in an adjacent constellation. The music
of the spheres (I suppose) is playing an air well known to Aéronauts
who have travelled any distance worth mentioning; viz., “Partant
pour la Sirius.”
I must move on somewhere else.

has become prevalent among the schools in general, of contending in bodily exer-

third annual athletic meeting at the Beaufort House Grounds, Walham Green, in
the presence of a large number of the sumptuous classes. -

the Cricket Ball,” “Putting the Weight,” “ Thrºwing the Hammer,” a “Hurdle
Race,” a “High Jump,” and a “ Consolation Race” instead of throwing the
Cricket Ball, one seems to fancy that the feat really performed was that of throwing
the Cranium; that the Weight put was a measure of that Heavy which, put down
the aesophagus, serves to relieve the dryness of anatomical studies; that the
hammer thrown was the Malleus, a little bone which it would be hard to fling a
long way; that the Hurdle Race was managed with frame-works composed of
tilize, fibulae, radii, ulnae, and ribs; that the High Jump was a leap over the skeleton
of the Irish Giant in Lincoln’s-inn Fields, and that the Consolation Race concluded
with a º: draught of beer.

A KISS FOR MISS AUSTRALIA.
y <- -> R. PUNCH, who has Cor-
* respondents every-
^ - where, has received
- º a complaint from
W
- §N \
Western Australia.
No part of the uni-
verse is too remote
to be noticed, at
need, by him, and
he has double satis-
faction in replying to
this complaint be-
cause he can throw
in a word or two to
all the Australians.
His Correspondent
alleges that people
at home have no in-
terest in the Colo-
nies, and , that the
gratification expressed by the DUKE of EDINBURGH in his recent
visit to Western Australia, was not unmixed with surprise at the
graceful and splendid hospitality which he received. He had not been
aware of the progress made, in those regions, in the arts of civilisation.
Does the ColoniaL SECRETARY himself know it? Yet, a Perth bard
is not satisfied with what was done in honour of the Duke, and vents
himself thus in the Fremantle Herald:—
“Our preparations were not quite so grand
As you might see in a more favoured land;
Think not young Prince we are a whit less true
In our devotion to our Queen and you.
Oh no! God bless her, and #. Royal Self
And every member of the House of Guelph ;
In fact had you but stayed another day
We would have made some efforts to be gay.”
Premising that Mr. Punch has reason to know that the Personage
whom the loyal colonists chiefly desired to please by their reception of
her son is more than pleased at that reception, Mr. Punch proceeds to
answer his Correspondent from the Swan River.
No interest in the Colonies, dear Sir? You mistake the matter
entirely. There is plenty of interest taken by those who know where
the Colonies are and what they mean, but the fact is that the majority
of people are so utterly ignorant of º that if they know where
Australia itself is, they are quite proud. But you must not expect
them to go into such details as the difference between New South
Wales and Victoria, or to know that Brisbane is the capital of the
former, that Perth is the º of Queensland, and that South Aus-
tralia used to be called Port Phillip. -
Ha! haſ my Colonists, you laugh, but those who have fallen into
my three traps have no idea why you laugh.
ou tell Mr. Punch how he is to make English people under-
stand a little about you, just enough to prevent their making a colonist
choke himself at dinner when his hostess asks him whether there are
any schools in Melbourne, or the gentleman next to him supposes that
the British population of Australia probably exceeds one hundred
thousand by this time? MR. AppERLEY descanted on this ignorance
in the House of Commons itself, last week, and no one contradicte
... Mr. Punch has tried to stick a few colonial facts into people,
but the seed falls on stony ground. However, he will not discontinue
his efforts. He insists on the following hymn being committed to
the memory of all persons under Twenty-one, and their Elders will be

WHAT IS LUGGAGE P
In these days of over-dressing, when ladies cannot manage to travel
for a week without a score or so of boxes, in each of which a camel-
lopard might be comfortably packed, it is not surprising that the
questi What is luggage?” should be argued in a Law Court. If
we look into a dictionary, we find that luggage is defined as “anything
cumbrous and difficult to carry: of more weight than value.” Now
ladies' dresses, with their long trains, certainly are cumbrous, and,
when packed in elephantine trunks, are rather difficult to carry; but
they are mostly so expensive that nobody can say they are of little
value. In the Queen's Bench very recently it was decided that a
rocking-horse was “hardly a thing ordinarily carried by a passenger,”
and therefore was not “luggage” in the ordinary sense. Several
good judges were heard on this occasion, and several good things were
said in course of argument, as the following will show:—
“MR. JUSTICE HAYEs suggested that the point might have been put that a
rocking-horse required a horse-box. (Laughter.)
“MR. Justice Lush put the case of a child's cradle, or a perambulator, or
a bedstead. -
“Numerous cases were put in the course of the argument; the case of a
gentleman carrying home a salmon or a barrel of oystèrs for dinner, or a
...; of wine for his cellar, or a case of books for reading in the train, and
so tortin.
“Mr. Justice HANNEN suggested that the rule might, perhaps, be laid
down thus—that the passenger was entitled to have anything which passen-
gers usually required for their personal use or accommodation on a journey,
. would include a bath or bathing tin, but exclude a rocking-horse or
cradle.”
With due respect to JUSTICE HANNEN, we may doubt if he will find
that many ladies will agree with him in thinking that a cradle is not a
thing “required on a journey,” when there is a baby to be carried and
popped into it, as soon, as the train stops. We can conceive what
Ini. would be felt by a young mother, if her precious poppet's
cradle were taken from the luggage van, and sent by common goods
train, as though it were a beer-barrel. As for carrying one's bath
about, that in some few summers more, we hope, will be quite need-
less, even on the Continent, for as civilisation spreads so does the art
of .# To let one's, bedstead travel with one is not a usual
course, although it certainly might save one from nocturnal irritation
where fleas do mostly congregate. But as to salmon and oysters,
these should clearly be called luggage, and carefully conveyed as such,
or what will your friends say when you leave town to visit them f. A man
who goes to spend a few days in the country takes a bit of fish as
naturally as he does the latest Punch, and if the fish, not being luggage,
were sent by the goods train, it would probably arrive just in time to
too late for any one to relish it.
UNDER THE BUTTERCUPS.
AMONG the miscellaneous intelligence of a country paper occurs a
paragraph stating that:-
“A man, named ForTUNE, aged 68, died at Swindon (Wilts) last week,
and in accordance with his last will and testament, the whole of the coffin
furniture, including the breast-plate, was painted yellow, indicative of the
political principles he had advanced in his life.”
Was MR. ForTUNE the Man in the Moon? Yellow principles, one
would think, are the sort of principles advanced in Sovereign Alley,
which might be otherwise called º Lane. But perhaps this
yellow politician was only bilious.
Facilis Descensus Averni.
New reading of an old proverb, (apropos of the late swallowing up of
certain noble flies by certain ignoble spiders)–
“Nemo repente fuit turfissimus.”
The meaning, we need hardly say, is exactly the same as that of the
usual version.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 241
PUNCHPS ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
May 31st, Monday. A night to be remembered. This might did the
Commons read a Third Time and Pass the Bill for Disestablishing and
Disendowing the Irish Church. Mr. Punch heard of no dismal Signs
or Prodigies worth mentioning, but perhaps they are reserved for the
day when the Royal Assent shall be given. -
#. Conservatives, of course, took a division, by way of a final
Protest, and it was preluded by an exceedingly flat debate, a matter
of mere form. MR. Holt, of North East Lancashire, moved the
Rejection of the Bill, and floan Eicuo, like a bold volunteer,
volunteered to second the motion, and e some very fair jokes—the
only fun of the evening. After speeches by divers who may dive into
Lethe, and stop there, MR. DISRAELI and the PREMIER finished the
business with orations which they were bound to deliver, but neither
ut himself into his work. The Leader of the ition, at great
ength, contended that the destruction of the Church would not tran-
º; Ireland, and that it was the first of a series of revolutionary
measures, the end of which would be the triumph of the Papacy, and
erhaps something worse. MR. GLADSTONE was pleasant over MR.
}. rejected amendments, and one passage is worthy of immor-
tality, which we thus give :-
“It appears that the Right Hon. Gentleman has borne in mind the history
of the patriarch JoB. The life and sufferings of that excellent man commence
with a touching account of his Disendowment, and the admirable courage with
which it was endured; and the narrative then cheeringly ends with the
announcement that, at the close of his life, he had more stock and greater
possessions than ever. He was the precise example, the very model on which
the Right Hon. Gentleman has framed his amendments to the disendowment
and disestablishment of the Irish Church. Had the benevolent designs of the
Right Hon. Gentleman taken effect, the Protestant Church, rich as it is in
numbers and the work it has to do, would be richer still. Under these
circumstances the Right Hon. Gentleman's power of astonishment was as
remarkable as his power of rhetorical description.”
He had no, complaint to make of the Lords for, rejecting the
Suspensory Bill, but the opinion of the country had been taken, as
demanded by their Lordships, and now they would stand face to face
with the nation. He would not be so unjust to them as to doubt that
they would consider what was due to the people on one hand, and
to their own permanent dignity and utility on the other.
We then voted, and the numbers may be worth record.

The Majority for the Bill was ONE HUNDRED AND FourTEEN.
The occasion being important, Mr. Punch would like to conclude
the tale with an elegant classical quotation; but as there was no
Established Church in Ireland in the days of Horace, he refrains from
any allusion to one. Still, come, hang it all, a gentleman and a scholar
must be able to cite Latin on the slightest provocation:—
“Conclamant omnes, thumpuntaue outrageously mensas.”
They didn't, for there were no tables to thump, but the macaronic
moral * the same. And so we dismissed the Irish Bill—for the
present.
That Elephant's Trunk pokes itself round the corner on all occasions,
and to-night it picked up the pin, before it rooted up the oak. The
House, previously to finishing off the Irish Church, took cognisance of
the case of two small children who were apprehended at dirty Brent-
ford—(well, it is dirty, and so it was when SHENstone writ
“As when through Brentford town, a town of mud,
A herd of bristly swine is pricked along)
for stealing wood from a fence. As usual, the grievance was nil—
rents had sent children to plunder, and the latter were led before the
eak, that the punishment might reach the real offenders. So stated
the Home SECRETARY. Were we not Elephantine *
The Lords read the Nº. Bill a Second Time. It is to do
away with certain regulations about securities and the like, once useful,
now vexatious. Lord CAIRNs took the opportunity of complainin
that the Government had sanctioned the suppression of the firebrand,
MURPHY, by the Magistrates of Tynemouth, one of the most sensible
things ever done where the song in the genteelest circles is,
“Where hest te been, maw canny hinny,
An' where hest te been, maw bonny bairn ?
Aw was up and doon seekin for maw hinny,
Aw was through the town seekin for maw bairn.”
The singer might have seekt in vain, if MURPHY had caused one of
his sanguinary riots.
Tuesday. LoRD GRANVILLE laid the Irish Church Bill on the table
of the House of Lords. “And when goes hence P’’ as Lady Macbeth
asks. The Second Reading was fixed for Monday, June 14th.
The Lords read a Bill about the Stannaries in Cornwall. The word
stannaries comes, from stannum, which means tin. The Latin, term
might be adopted by those whose mental conformation so, curiously
disinclines them ever to mention Money, and who always talk of cash,
the needful, tin aforesaid, the rowdy, browns, dibs, dragons, sinews
of war, coal, ochre, filthy lucre, mopuses, and so forth.
It was stated in the Commons that the Ruler of Egypt would be
here about the 22nd of June, and that (this time) he ºš be hospitably
treated. He is to be lodged in Buckingham Palace. Mr. Punch
observes that objection has been made to calling this eminent poten-
tate the Khedive, which should be, Khedeve—because it is Arabic
for king, and the SULTAN is King of Egypt. But if cavillers will con-
sult that invaluable work, MR. MARTIN's Statesman's Year Book,
(which more well-informed writers, consult than cite—ha! ha"), they
will find that this title was conferred by an Imperial Firman of May 14,
1867. Egypt, is independent, and hereditary in the family of IsMAIL
PASHA, our guest.

much fun at his expense, and not in condonation of any of his alleged
offences against commercial morality—since his time illustrated by
brilliant financing which throws his cookery of accounts into the shade
- Mr. Punch points out the case for notice. It can hardly be expected
that the sycophants who fawned upon him, in their greed for his money
and hospitality, will do anything for a fallen man—'tis not their nature
To; but some of a better sort must have profited by him, and might
left the poor old king.
udson's Bay, we repeat, is taken (for a noble consideration) from
the H. Company, who were chartered by the chartered libertine
who reigned in 1670, and it is to belong to the Dominion of Canada.
There is an awful lot of the very savagest sort of Indians to be im-
proved off the premises, Stone, Copper, Hare, Dog-Rib, Strong-Bow,
Cree, and Black-Feet cusses; and as our friends, the subjects of KING
ULysses, next door, have got their hands in at that sort of work, they
might show their good feeling by lending us the said hands. Then
Mr. Punch takes it, a grand field for wholesale emigration will be iaid
open in this huge region, hitherto a strictly preserved hunting:ground,
where poachers were treated even more summarily than in the dukeries.
Wednesday was a holiday, HER MAJESTY's fiftieth birthday was kept.
There were illuminations—some were Crowns; Mr. Punch lighted up
a whole Regalia—and smoked it, to the delight of mankind.
Thursday. The Lords put LoRD RUssell’s Life-Peerages Bill through
Committee. The number of peers to be made in a year was reduced
to two, and the total number is to be twenty-eight. The motto for
these coronets should be from Pope :-
“Why, you'll enjoy it only all your life.”
A meat thing in Indian Civil Services came before the Commons.
Successful native candidates disqualified because their IIoroscopes, or
whatever do duty for baptismal certificates, did not state their age
rightly. A sharp native found this out, and gave the next candidates
the straight tip, doubtless disinterestedly. e can only recommend
all natives to be baptised. -
We put the Bankruptcy Bill through Committee, with much
lawyer-wrangle.
Friday. Statement by LoRD CLARENDON, on the invitation of the
Great Eltohi — who spoke with the most finished and reticent
eloquence—touching the American difficulty. Mr. Punch would be
content to leave to any half-dozen educated and impartial Americans
final judgment as to the willingness of England to do all that honour
enjoined or permitted. - - -
HAppleLD is a very good old Dissenter, and his eighty-two
years entitle him—being a worthy, man—to consideration. But he
dissents a little too much. To-night he wanted to stop the Revision
of the Statutes, though it is going on very decently. No, said the
Commons, by a majority of 153. - -
MR. GREGoRY made an earnest speech in favour of opening Museums
on Sundays. He was answered by MR. ALLEN (Newcastle), MR.
M‘ARTHUR (Lambeth), and MR. CHAMBERs (Marylebone), who all
protested against what they contended would lead to French, Sundays,
declaring that the feeling of the great majority of the working class
was opposed to the proposal. One of the artisans had, designated
Sunday as “Heaven's antidote to the curse of Labour.” . Himself
irretrievably idle—no, contemplative is a prettier word—Mr. Punch
cordially endorses the sentiment that labour is a cuss, Interpone tuis
interdum gaudia curis. The Commons, following this counsel, were
Counted Out.
Saturday. Great meetin
to do with the Irish Churc
of Conservative Peers to consider what
Bill. Mr. Punch considered them.

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
N London. —The pro-
gress of my book,
Typical Developments,
Wol. I., brings me
up to town to find
a publisher. MIL-
BURD, whom I meet
tº: Says
“A publisher would

im what publisher
He says, in an off-
hand way, “Oh, any
ublisher,” but
oesn’t volunteer
º any particular infor-
2-º mation on the sub-
- ject. BooDELs, I re-
member, published a volume of poems a year or two since.
. Happy Thought.—To write to BooDELs, and ask what publisher
jumped at his poems.
Odd that my wife doesn’t enter into my work. We have been
married three years. I read her the first chapter of Book I. during the
honeymoon. Since that time I have sometimes said, “Now, I’ll read
you some more,” or have selected some passage that has struck me as
peculiarly happy. She has generally been busy. One evening, on m
opening the manuscript, she said she didn't want to be bothered.
told her I didn’t think it was kind of her. She replied, that rather
than I should think her unkind, she’d listen. I returned, “Oh, but
don’t, if you’d rather not.” She said that though she’d rather not,
yet she would, to please me. I didn't want to be cruel, so I said,
“Never mind.” She confesses she’d like to see it when it was in
print. Before we married I thought that FRIDoIINE cared for litera-
ture. She doesn’t: except for novels. . - -
Her mother, MRs. SYMPERson, is staying with us at my cottage, in
a lovely situation.
Happy Thought.--To come up to London to look for a publisher.
Also might see the Academy, and the Opera, and dine with some
fellows at the Club.
Happy Thought.—Not to say anything about this, as of course I
don't know that I am going to do it: only mention the publisher.
They i. they shan’t be dull without me; and as I haven't been away
for a holiday—I mean away from home—for some time, my wife thinks
it will do me good.
Happy Thought.—To say it’s not a holiday—it’s business. Going
to London, in fact, on business. My mother-in-law suggests that we
should all go. All means herself principally. I point out that I shall
only be away, probably, for a day or two. Better to say “probably,” in
case I should stop three weeks. I add that I shall be engaged the
Whole time, and not be able to attend, to them. FRInoLINE says,
“Yes, better wait till we can all go away to Brighton. Baby will want
change of air soon.”
Happy Thought.—To agree at once. Brighton, by all means, for
baby, at some time or other. I consider this to be the condition of my
getting away now. My own opinion privately is that Brighton may
wait. Baby is always having a rash, and always wanting, so they say,
to go to Brighton. - - -
leave the cottage (Asphodel, Cottage it is called—that is, FRIDDy
. call it Asphodel) in the lovely situation, and go up by the 4'40
OWn.
Happy Thought.—Take my cheque-book.
In the Train.—It occurs to me that going to a hotel in town is
expensive. I’ll drive to Bob WILLIs's, in Conduit Street. WILLIs
asked me whenever I wanted a bed in town to come to him.
In Conduit Street.—I jump out and ring. I know WILLIs well: a
i. fellow—always glad to see me. WILLIs is a sort of fellow who’d
o anything for you. I foresee how I’ll dash past the servant, rush
up-stairs, and say, “WILLIS, old boy, here’s a lark: I’ve come to stay
with you.” And WILLIS will iſſº Wº: and order the bed, and —
The door opens. The maid. “Is MR. WILLIs in P” “MR. Who,
Sir f" the maid asks. “WILLIs.” “No one of that name here,” she
says, as if she expected me to try another name, as that wouldn’t do.
I ask her “if she’s quite sure?” On second thoughts, this question
was absurd, as of course she'd know who was living in the house. I
am perplexed. I say, “Oh, he’s not here, eh?” to myself.
Happy Thought.-Perhaps he's next door.
The maid says, “Yes, perhaps next door.” She shuts hers, and I
go to the next door bell. I don’t know why, but I fancy the cabman
doesn't think much of me after this failure. Perhaps his idea is, that
it’s a dodge of mine for not paying the fare. It’s º of him if he
thinks that, because he’s got my portmanteau and my hat-box, and my
bag with the MS. of Typical Developments in it. I’ve heard of swindlers'
portmanteaus filled with stones. He may think mine a swindler's port-
manteau, but even in that case it would be worth more than two-and-
sixpence—his fare, at the outside. Besides, there’s Typical Develop-
ments, worth thousands, perhaps : only, not to a cabman.
Next door opens; I put the question diffidently this time; in fact, I
beg her pardon first, and then request to be informed if “anyone of
the name of WILLIs lives here?” “Yes, Sir.”
Ah, capital here we are Down come my things. Here, cabman,
half-a-crown. He is indignant, and says he’s been waiting about more
than half-an-hour. I dispute it. He says, “Look here: it was six
when you took me at the Station, now it’s seven.” It might have
been six—it is seven.

Sixpence makes very little difference: pay him.
“Which floor are WILLIs's rooms?” ... Second. I rush up. I
bound into the room., “Hallo, old boy—”. In another instant I

He cuts me short courteously. They have a room together.
Happy Thought.—Like Bor and Cor.
I don't say this, but think it. WILLIs may be in by eight, or if
not by eight, not till twelve. Would I like to wait?
Happy Thought.—Say I'll come back about nine; and first go and
get some dinner. I add that I think that will be my best course.
The stranger (WILLIs's partner—the Cor of the firm) politely agrees
with me that that will perhaps be my best course. He doesn’t offer
me any dinner there...I hate inhospitality. I mean if anybody, a
Fº stranger, but still a friend of the partner of my rooms, came in,
should press him to take something—sherry and a biscuit. I say,
however, that I’ll leave mythings here (this will give Wuºis a hint
of what I mean by coming at all), and I will return when I’ve dined.
The stranger (Cow) replies, seriously, “Very good,” and is evidently
getting bored by me. I retire.
Happy Thought.—At all events I’ve found out where WILLIs lives.
#. dine somewhere. Where At my Club, or somebody else's
UlD.
Turning into Regent Street, I come accidentally upon WIGTHORPE.
He is delighted to see me. I am to see him. I think (to myself) that
I’ll ask him to come and dine with me at my Club. I think it over
while I'm walking with him, and he’s telling me a story about what
he did, last week, in Devonshire. He stops suddenly to ask me if I
don’t think that (whatever it was he was saying) a capital idea? I
reply, “Yes,” and put off giving him my invitation until I see what he
is going to go." He asks me what I’m going to do to-night.
Happy Thought.—To reply, cautiously, that I’ve got to go and see
WILLIs. He says that he’s sorry for this, as he should have liked me
to dine with him. I say I can, with pleasure. “Or, stop,” he says,
suggestively, “suppose I dine with you ?”
Happy Thought.—Too late to order dinner at my Club. Very incon-
venient. Fix it for another day. Say I’ll write to him, “Very well,
then,” he says, “we’ll dine together, and you shall have a French
#." “Capital. Agreed.” We walk off together to a French
Inner.
SPORTS FOR MODERN ATHLETES.
ATHLETIC sports of all descriptions, appear to be (as elsewhere
recorded), so much the order of the day, that, we should not be
astonished if the prize which is obtained for the throwing of the
hammer should be followed by another soon for throwing of the
hatchet. Nor would it much surprise us if the casting of the caber
were thought of more importance by certain clerkly rivals than the
casting of accounts. If a prize be ever offered for prowess in the feat
of outrunning the constable, we trust that all young athletes will
abstain from competition for it. In a similar conception, the sport
of running up a hill may be innocuous enough, but there is peril, in
the pastime of running up a bill. Be it remembered likewise, that
the athletic feat of jumping to conclusions may, in certain cases, be
practised with impunity, but the sport of drawing the long bow is
ºnly more dangerous, and it had better be avoided by every civil
clerk.
Keep the Money at Home.
“Oriental Bazaar, at the Queen's Rooms, Hanover Square, on behalf of the
Palestine Christian Union Mission to the Arabs.”
Has not a word dropped out here? Ought it not to be “to the Street
Arabs”? Too many of them may be found in London, looking as
though they sorely needed attention, from some, Mission or other.
Cannot Arabia wait until heathen London shows a little more improve-
ment?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[June 12, 1869.
CHACUN A son GouT.
BROwn AND Mrs. B. SAY, THAT PEOPLE MAY SAY what THEY LIKE ABOUT
ART, BUT IN THEIR OPINION THERE Is No MistAKE ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENT
IN THE ACADEMY THIs YEAR.
HINT FOR ASCOT.
IN that excellent paper, Berrow's Worcester Journal,
there is an exceeding lon letter in exceeding small type.
Those two facts, coupled with a third, namely that the
letter is a rampant Catholic's remonstrance with some
| Protestant critic, utterly precludes Mr. Punch, who values
his eyes and his temper, from reading the epistle. But the
said eyes fell upon, one passage, which he extracts. The
writer is defending belief in the efficacy of Holy Water:—
“St. Jerome, in his life of St. Hilarion, tells a wonderful story
relative to the effects of blessed water on the horses of Italicus,
a Christian citizen of Gaza. , Hilarion having filled a cup with
holy water, Italicus sprinkled with it the stables, horses, drivers,
chariots, and even the race-course on which his horses were to
run against the duumvir of Gaza. The Pagan laughed at Ita-
| licus; but when his horses had won the race many of the people
were in consequence converted. Such is the account given to
us by the great St. Jerome. Clearly he had no Protestant dread
of holy water.”
As most turf men are heathens, of the darkest sort, we
wonder that some modern Italicus does not try this ex-
periment. If a Catholic horse wins at Ascot on Thursday,
we shall know what to think.
Forgetful Self-Devotion.
According to the Union, French newspaper, legitimist
and º organ, a man in Spain, who has already lost an
arm and a leg in Carlist insurrections, had lately come to
place the rest of his body at the service of DoN CARIos.
Generous but unreflecting enthusiast ! If he should lose
his one leg, he will be unable either to go or stand; and, in
case of his losing his other arm, how will he be able to
wash his face P. It is perhaps fortunate that heroes do not
generally consider too curiously the particular inconvenience

“HoP PROSPECTs.”—Balls to come.
A TORNADO WANTED.
ONE hates to bear hard on a nation in difficulties, as one hates to hit
a man when he is down, but really Spain is very trying.
“Trying” is the word. She tries, or professes to try, º
that she may be enabled to evade the end of trial—Justice. e case
of the Tornado is now three years old. The ship is still condemned
prize, according to what the Spaniards call their Admiralty law, which
consists, Step lst : in seizing an 'unarmed ship belonging to British
subjects as contraband of war. , Step 2nd ; in proceeding to condemn
her, on exparte evidence, taken behind the owners' backs, and without
allowing them to produce their witnesses. This is called the Sumario, or
summary procedure. . It does seem “summary” with a vengeance—
in the sense of the old summary Border law, called “Jeddart justice”
—hanging first, and hearing afterwards.
Then comes Step 3rd, referring the case for rehearing to the Court
called Plenariº, being the Court which has already condemned the ship
as Sumario. This is what in Spain is called an Appeal. It is not
even the old one from PHILIP drunk to PHILIP sober, but from Don
Damnatory to Don Double-damnatory. This curious double shuffle
is introductory to
Step 4th, the Appeal to what is called a Royal Commission. But
the Royal Commission turns out to be composed of the same judges
who have .* sat twice in the case, as Summary Court first—as
Plenary Court afterwards.
So that in the Spanish Prize Court, as in SHAKSPEARE's precious
verses, “one Judge in his time plays many parts: ”—
First, as Judge Summary;
Second, as .# Plenary;
Third, as Royal Commissioner.
It need hardly be added, that the owners of the ship declined to
produce evidence at either of the two later stages, before the tribunal
which had begun by condemning them. And so Plenario has com-
§. confirmed the sentence of Sumario, and Commissionario of
7tarzo.
We remember nothing like this since the Irish gentleman, who hated
solitary drinking, and so used to pass the bottle briskly from right
hand to left.
As LoRD STANLEY has already intimated to the Spanish Minister
that he considers the sentence of the Sumario a nullity, LoRD CLAREN-
DoN can hardly hold the nullity to be converted into a reality, by this
passing the same sentence from right hand to left of the same Judges.
If the Spanish Themis is a thimblerigger, that is no reason why John
BULL's servants should let her, go on playing her little game—“on
two, three, under, which thimble is the nimble pea.”. She has seiz.
an unarmed English ship: she has robbed, imprisoned, and ill-used its
crew: she has made widows and orphans of the wives and children
of some of that crew who have sunk under their hardships. . -
And when she is called to account for these things she tries to ring
the changes on - -
Sumario,
Plenario, and
Commissionario.
The “Three Courts of Justice all rolled into one,” the Cerberus—
three heads but same dog—who stands on guard at the door of her
Prize Court, whose bark is so much worse than its bite, that the
British Bulldog is almost ashamed to show his teeth to an adversary
who shelters so much insolence under so much impotence.
But patience has its limits. Diplomacy is long-suffering, and mag-
nanimity never becomes the strong so much as when dealing with the
weak. All which while John BULL most potently believes, he
believes also that his Government owes a duty to British sailors and
British subjects. If the owners of the Tornado were knowingly en-
gaged in sending out a Chilian war-ship, there is nothing to show that
the crew were participators in the knowledge, not a tittle of evidence
to warrant making them prisoners of war, still less plundering them,
and ill-using them, while thus unjustifiably kept prisoners.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
*That Spain should be involved, just now in a tempest on her own
account, is no reason why we should let her hear the last of our Tornado.
Even if we waive the claim and case of the owners of that ship, gross
injustice and cruel wrong have been inflicted on º British
sailors and British subjects, and this LoRD CLARENDON is bound to
see repaired, or
“Thirty million Englishmen
Should know the reason why.”
NOTES IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
ON going into the gardens the first feeling is one of disappointment:
the animal of all others which you made sure of finding at the entrance
is not there—the Dormouse.
In the Monkey House see the Fruit-bat, most probably suspended
with his head downwards, an ingenious gymnastic feat which fairly
entitles this little creature to be called an Acro-bat.
Because you are a good Protestant, do not be deterred from going
into the most popular building in the Gardens, on account of the
Capuchins. There is no intention of perverting the Monkey House
into a Monkery.
The Society should advertise their chief curiosities, and end the list
with And a man Pig.
Is a Goose in a pie necessarily a Pied Goose?
“The Cheer. Two females and a male of this singularly marked bird
were obtained from Simla in the year 1857.’. They were popularly
known as “Three Cheers.” There are sim’lar birds now in the
Gardens. -
The Emeus, “belonging to the same group of birds as the Ostriches,”
may justly be said to Emu-late them.
The Harnessed Antelope is likely to be seen in the Drive in the
Park in, the course of the Season. The Gnu is anything but new,
having been in the Gardens since 1865. Call upon the Sing-sing
Antelope for a song.
The legs of the Flamingo are not composed of pink sealing-
Wax.
Immediately after seeing the Lyre-bird, go and look at the
arpy.
The Society have not as yet succeeded in adding to their collection
of Llamas the greatest of them all—the Grand Llama of Tibet. “No
more valuable present could be made by the Society’s Correspondents”
in that country.
If i. do not read the label carefully, you will not unreasonably
from his grave 'appearance, conclude that the Boobook Owl is calle
the Blue-book Owl.
The Otter likes warm weather. Indeed, he has been heard to say,
(corrupted, there is reason to fear, by the conduct of too many of his
visitors with regard to the aspirate) the Otter the better.
Do not omit to visit the New Elephant House, aptly named by
MAssINGER Rivers—“Elephanta.”
A CASE FOR PROPER HEARING.
PLEASE, dear Toby, stand up prettily upon your hind legs, and beg
your master, Mr. Punch, to order people not to crop the ears of little
dogs like you and me, who cannot hear without them. Perhaps they
do not know that cruelty like this is contrary to law; but the other
day two men—or rather brutes, as I should call them—were pulled up
at a police court, and would have been sent to prison if they had not
paid a fine, for º a #." puppy. They said that cropping was
a “custom,” and really did not hurt (I wonder how they would
have liked their own ears cropped, for an experiment), and their lawyer
tried to make out that because SIR Epwin LANDSFER had painted
dogs with cropped ears, he proved that it was customary, and himself
even approved of it. But SIR Edwin bravely gave his evidence in
favour of us dogs, and as he painted my great-grandfather I am proud
of his opinion.
As dogs can only bark, and yelp, and howl, and growl, and whine,
and whimper, (a language which poor human creatures don't yet
understand), neither you nor I, nor any of our friends, were put into
the witness-box to say if cropping hurt us. But there was this medical
evidence brought forward of the fact—
“MR. FLEMING, veterinary surgeon of the Royal Engineers, stated that the
operation would be an act of cruelty to the dog, and cause it extreme pain.
He explained that dogs of that breed had drooping ears, which, if cut in the
way which was presented by the little terrier in Court left the inner parts
unprotected, and in many cases produced deafness. He attributed the cutting
of dogs' ears to a depraved taste, and denied that it was the usual custom.”
Dear Toby, please tell Mr. Punch that having half our ears cut off
does hurt us very badly; and as it is against the law, I hope he’ll put
a stop to it, and thus win the lasting gratitude of you and me, and
thousands like us who have had the j. to be born
A TINY TERRIER.
OUIR LONDON LAZYRONI.
THE orders given by Dogberry to the policemen of the period, that
they were “to comprehend, all vagrom men,” seem scarcely to be
echoed now in Scotland Yard, or we should not see so many beggars
in the streets. Such things are better managed by our friends across
the Channel, where the streets are cleared by law from all the human
rubbish that proves to be a nuisance:—
“Every person found begging in a locality in which there is a public
establishment organised to obviate the necessity for mendicity, is punishable
by imprisonment for a term of not less than three, nor more than six, months,
and is afterwards conducted to the depôt de mendicité. The regular beggar
incurs a term of imprisonment of from one to three months. Beggars acting
in concert, or using threats, or mimicking infirmities, or trespassing within
an enclosure, a yard, or habitation, incur a prison penalty, the extreme limit
being two years.”
By “depôt de mendicité” is simply meant a poor-house, but our
French friends are particularly fond of a fine phrase. , What ablessin
it would be if we could take a leaf out of their legislative code, and
every beggar now in England were first popped into a prison, and then
shut up in a poor-house! Beggars: “acting in concert” very often
play the flute and other ear-tormenting instruments, with which the
rob #". working people—working with their brains—of time whic
yº iº money to them, and of temper also, which is likewise yery
Valuatoie.
Such º deserve richly to “incur, a prison penalty,”
as do brutes who bully ladies whom they meet without an escort, and
frighten into giving what will pay for a night's drink. Rascals such
as these are punishable by our English law, as are impostors who sham
sickness for the sake of getting alms. But our policemen, as a rule,
have other things to think of—their new moustache, for instance—than
taking up street beggars; and so London is infested with swarms of
lazyroni, who dog our heels, like yelping curs, whenever we walk out.
BY COACH TO BRIGHTON.
YE lovers of the ºl. approach !
To Brighton you can now go down by Coach;
Ye hippic men, who love the whipthong's crack,
A Four-in-hand now takes you there and back.
Not in a railway carriage, but outside
A Coach, by leave of weather, let me ride,
For riding's sake, with time at my command,
To gaze about upon a lovely land -
That was, and so still, here and there, remains, .
Where smoky Progress may have spared the plains.
Waft me the breath of flowers, ye gentle gales,
And not such whiffs as firebox, stoked, exhales, .
Delightful change, woods, fields, and meadows fair,
From hideous posters in your face that flare,
Free of those horrors when the vision roves:
Not yet has puffing commerce billed the groves.
Returns, in thought, the old Saturnian reign, .
And GEORGE THE Fourth his wig assumes again.
Then the weird music of the vanished Past
Blends with the coach-horn's old remembered blast,
And spirits, while the horses changing are,
Appear; as fellows light the mild cigar.
A WORD TO PLAYGOERS.
You are on the point, on the eve, of starting for a theatre. You
will be a loser if you do not go to the Adelphi, and see the new
domestic drama, Ere. It is “freely adapted” from the French (not
offensively), but the renue—the legal characters in the story tempt to
the use of legal terms—is laid in our own country and time, and a
successful trial and a satisfactory verdict may be predicted for the
Adelphi appellants. There are only five of them—stay, there are six,
for Miss º LEE’s pretty ways and words must not be forgotten
—but all can make out a strong case in their favour on the hearing.
Indeed, MR. WEBSTER, MR. H. NEville, MR. J. C. TAYLOR, MRs.
MELLON, and Miss FURTADo, are not an unlikely party to carry the
Court with them generally. The story is one of temptation, and
moral danger, and noble distress; but, happily, it has not been
thought indispensable to try any of the characters on a capital charge,
or to make an inveterate forger one of the dramatis personae; and, in the
end, Eve escapes from her peril as wife, and is restored to happiness.
The second º the three acts is especially striking : all London should
see MR. WebstER in its power and pathos. -
Perhaps the comic business, although supplying much amusement
is somewhat intrusive; certainly it is introduced too soon at the en
of the last act, where it interferes with a fine and pathetic situation,
But this little defect may have been remedied since the first nights of
representation.

IT may have occurred to some statesmen that the best

SOCIAL SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
At this awakenin -
activity as well as the sporting. Whilst the latter has been pursuing
its summum bonum on the Downs and the Lawn, the former has had its
whack at Exeter Hall. Different * have different opinions; some
like the Turf and others the Platform: every man to his liking, as the
noble lord said when he backed his horse. A considerable muster of
the votaries of philanthropy, mostly of the “upper ten,” was held on
Tuesday week last, at the house of SIR PERCY BURRELL, Bart.,
Berkeley Square, in LADY BURRELL’s drawing-room, under the presi-
dency of the EARL or SHAFTESBURY, and the title of the “Ladies
Sanitary Association.” This affair of the Shaftesbury lot is not in anywise
a bumbug, but really altogether a good .# and no mistake about it.
Object, “to extend and popularise the knowledge of the laws of health
by means of libraries, lectures, tracts, clothing and coal clubs, and
other similar agencies.” -
Though mainly composed of ladies, it does not scorn the assistance
of the sterner sex; some of whom were present at its late réunion, and
held forth. They included MR. CHADwick, and, moreover, several
distinguished sons of Æsculapius. Among the medical i. One
was DR. FARRE, who, you may be sure, would never lend his name to
bosh, and another, was DR. DRUITT, whose judicious treatise on light
wines is a material guarantee that he could not possibly countenance
* species of shamabraham. . -- -
he report of this fair Association of Good Sanitarians, read by MRs.
BUTLER, one of its Hon; Secs, disclosed a goodly series of bond fide
transactions. H.R.H. the Crown Princess of Prussia had become one
of their Lady Patronesses. They had printed five hundred copies of
the Home Almanac in the present year; the same number of essays on
small-pox and vaccination; likewise one hundred copies of the Society’s
10th Annual Report, and had reprinted some thousands of tracts, which,
their contents consisting of useful knowledge and common sense, have
probably not been physically, utilised for spills, or otherwise, by their
receivers. The Association had sent 13,243 children, last season, to
season of the year the serious world starts into 3
play in the Parks—cost £21,135.7d., as SAM PEPys says. The Com-
mittee of Destitute Children's Dinner Society (in co-operation with it)
had opened 37 dining-rooms up to September, 1868, in the poorest
istricts, of London, made grants to the amount of £884, and sold
substantial dinners to 83,119 children, at la per head; thus feeding,
without #; the *.
Some fifty of the ragged, if not the naked, had been also clothed by
the Association. “The clothing consisted of fifty calico shirts, twenty-
one red flannel shirts with Garibaldi tops and long sleeves, twenty-one
linsey skirts, twenty-nine blue serge dresses, and fifty white straw hats
trimmed with blue ribbon.” I quote these details for the edification of
your lovely readers. The London Dressmakers' Company, connected
with the Association, was thriving—had shot, branches into divers
towns. The Association had in view a project for establishing nur-
series for motherless young children, to serve as schools for nurses,
and for mothers of all classes. Balance-sheet for 1868:-receipts,
£51.12s. 10d. ; expenditure, £4042s. 1d.; surplus, £1070s. 9d. This
Association has much to show for little money, precisely the reyerse of
Societies for the Conversion of the Cannibals, and the Jews, which have
many more missionaries to produce than converts, and in the opinion
of your humble servant, when its fair constituents send round the
fanchon, they should get it back filled with bank-notes, and would
deserve to, even if the receptacle for subscriptions were a coalscuttle
bonnet. The horse no doubt is not only a noble, but a worshipful
animal, and some of the nobility and #. who have more money
than they know what to do with, may like to relieve themselves thereof
by playing at ducks and drakes with it, on the Turf, whilst others
#. the Members of the Ladies' Sanitary Association, prefer to expend
their superfluous tin on the pastime of practical beneficence, which
must at least be admitted to be quite as amusing, if not as rational, for
those who like it, as the other. For a contrast between those two sorts
of diversions, the Ascot Week affords a seasonable opportunity to

THE CHESTER GIRLS.
VZ 42-se *N/ Ø-SNN “WHAT imports the nomina-
tion of these ladies?” will
be the Shaksperianic query
that will at once occur to
Mr. Punch's myriad readers.
What of the Girls of º:
sant Chester on the Dee,
the Deva of the Romans,
the capital of Cheshire, a
bishop's see, and a cit
interesting for its antiqui-
ties, pop. 35,000? y,
this, when Mr. Punch can
master his rage sufficiently
to explain it. Somebody
has been writing in the
Chester Observer to the
effect that the Girls of
Chester are a very flagrant
sort of Girls of the Period.
A sort of sensation has fol-
% lowed, and Mr. Punch is
appealed to for a just sen-
tence.
It is due to the Chester
Observer to say that it has
opened its columns to a
defence of the young ladies.
But this defence, conducted
by independent champions,
more or less gifted with the
power of spelling accu-
rately, is remarkable rather
for its zealthamforits ability.
It chiefly consists in abusing the cynical critic. He deserves all he
gets, but he does not get an answer. - - - -
r. Punch hereby tramples him beneath the deep Titanian prisons,
as SHELLEY's Jupiter proposed to do with Demogorgon, only that
Punch does what Zeus could not do. Mr. Punch has had the pleasure
of beholding the Girls of Chester many a time and off, and it is not
because º smiled upon him (how could Beauty fail to smile on
Chivalry ) that he will believe that they cast other smiles otherwise
than with maidenly propriety. He i. pleasant memories of their
grace, their particularly łºśh and fresh and cheery faces, and their
meat-nay, elegant, and not extravagant apparel. Further, he hath
reason to speak of their good sense, for He is their favourite Author
and Mentor, and he is proud of his scholars. Nor does he believe, as
alleged by some of their unwise defenders, that the Youths of Chester,
by reason of ignorance and intemperance, are unworthy to find sweet-
hearts and wives in the fair Cestrians. There be fools everywhere,
(especially among º who volunteer letters to the press,) but let
the º speak. Manly Youth and Gentle Girlhood of Chester
are as fond of getting united in holy matrimony as in any other of our
comely cities, and the excellent #. of Chester waves his episcopal
staff over as meritorious a flock as you shall see in merry England.
All this happeneth to be within Mr. Punch's own knowledge. He hath
spoken. Let the Dee become Laughing Water, as he blows his kiss
to the Cestrian Minnehahas. But the Rhoodee is the most beestly
racecourse in England—worse than Epsom.
MR. PUNCH*S ENGLISH PRIZE POEM.
Omitted, by some unaccountable oversight, to be recited in the Sheldonian
Theatre, Oxford, on Wednesday June 9th, 1869, Commemoration Day.
DEEP in the west the roseate life expired,
Woods, waves, and wolds with fierce effulgence fired,
Day to his doom had gone, Night's tranquil car
Rose from the zenith and the regal star,
Hidden away by bush and tangled brake,
It crowned the foreshore of an ancient lake,
And with a thousand shafts and spires of gºld
Lightened the forest and illumed the wold.
Its towers of tufa, and its walls of quartz,
§: and splendid with vice-regal courts,
Chambers where Kings and ermined Kaisars spent
The contributions which their subjects sent,
With rosy wreaths and bliss of golden wine,
With beauty's argent laugh and smile divine,
With voice and lute, with harpsichord and gong,
With cymbals clashing for the maddened throng,
With tissues woven in Golconda's looms,
With diamond dados to rococo rooms,
With hawk and hound, the partridge and the fox,
And matches lighting only on the box.
A happy life before the Penny Press,
With no restrictions about evening dress,
Pleasure alone its lord, its light, its lay,
Born for the sunshine and the dream of day;
Perennial mirth, perpetual jest
Men free from duns, wives in their servants blessed,
Children who went to bed without a word,
Taxes unknown and organs never heard,
Smoke self-consumed, the weather always fine,
And no adulteration in the wine.
The people there in that ambrosial land
Gave Peace the fist and Fellowship the hand,
Called it not glory to destroy their kind,
And wore their hats according to their mind:
Content to see their image in the stream,
They would not trespass on the solar beam,
And when a great man died, they did not care
To place his statue in the public square.
º: in their life no ebb, no reflex show,
Change or mutation they can never know,
Were then as now, and also now asthen
Peaceful, pacific, paneirenic men.
Primaeval race, with undisputed wills,
And no man running or refusing bills,
Lapped in the golden age of hoary time,
#. pleiosauri revelled in their slime,
And the great mastodon from dawn to day
Rood upon rood in lush morasses lay;
When Egypt's mummied kings were yet to come
With the soft timbrel and the sumptuous drum ;
Ere the last phoenix reared her latest brood,
Where godlike Nilus rolls his unctuous flood,
Ere Memnon watched the Sphinx's early grace,
And tuned her charms before her blushing face,
Heard by the Arab as he milked his flocks,
And speared the vampire on the jasper rocks,
#.”by the Fakir in the lonely swamp
Burying the ibis with affection’s pomp;
What time the wizard with his magic scroll
Watched for the planet wheeling to the pole,
And in the strange conjunction of the stars
Read the sure portent of impending wars;
What time the maiden moon patrolled the skies,
And PLATo trembled at HYPATIA’s eyes,
Searching for wisdom at her secret shrine,
And teaching man the substance and the sign,
Yearning to seek, and seeking but to find
The best and brightest dogma of the mind,
Yearning to leave the eidolon he found,
Westured with beauty, with enchantment crowned,
Till in the conflict of tumultuous thought
He grasped the vision which his genius sought,
And in the calm of his own Academe
Shaped for all time the transport and the dream.
A Worm for an Airlie Bird.
Sirius arousing and the pensive Bear -
To leap to splendour in their glittering lair,
And where the waters of Jaxartes foam,
To guide and guard the storm-tossed sailor home.
Sleep, like a mother, in her arms caressed
All who had sought the cradle of her breast;
Birds, beasts, and bees recumbent from their toils
Found the repose dyspepsia never spoils,
And in the calm contentment of the sky,
Care lost its cark, and sorrow ceased her sigh.
Far in the bowers of a dreamy wood
A long-forgotten city daily stood,
THE Interness Courier says that the EARL of AIRLIE, having become
º: of the house made famous as LoRD MACAULAY's residence,
olly. (or #º Lodge, has changed the name to Airlie Lodge.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCHPS ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 7th. The EARL of DEvoN, presenting a petition for
the Rejection of the Irish Church Bill, disagreed with the petitioners
and advised the Peers to read a Second Time, and amend the sai
I. C. B. This was the counsel which the Lords CARNARvoN, SALIs-
BURY, and STANHoPE gave to the Lords on the previous Saturday, and
which was spurned by LoRD DERBY, who resolved to go plenum sed—
full butt—against a stone wall. Wide Cartoon.
On the Metropolitan District Railway Bill the DUKE of RUTLAND
proposed a clause compelling the Directors to provide smoking com-
partments. Fumigating nobles do not travel on that line, so the Duke
was defeated...Mr. Punch, however, is not enraged, this time. There
be great objections to ºngºment where the passengers
are so many and the stoppages so brief.
The Hoº &GRETARY was giving an account of the late lamentable
affair at Mold, where it was necessary to fire on a raging and savage
mob of colliers, (and where an unoffending girl was killed through the
wicked habit of firin , not straight at the guilty, but where the inno-
cent usually are,) and had paid a most deserved tribute to the forbear-
ance of and soldiers, when
Mr. Gºrstoº entered the House, and was received with cheering
that shook the roof. This was the Liberal answer to the Conservative
demonstration against the I. C. B. If the Opposition had remembered
the first performance of Cato, they might have imitated the Tories of
that time, wh9, when the Whigs cheered any passage in favour of
liberty, echoed the cheer, “to show that the satire was unfelt.”
[Sp of Annison, Mr. Punch thanks Paoressor HENRY MoRLEY
for the mos ital and compact of modern editions, in one volume, of
the Spectator, with admirable notes and specimens. #the quaint adver-
tisem gentleman should be with it... You don’t like the
Fº Anything to oblige. Nogentleman should be without it.]
ut they gave no sign. Punch with the Standard that it was
not for to hoot the PRIME MINISTER—they were melancholy and
gentlemanlike, as Master Stephen says. But they did their cheering on a
later evening, in honour of the Tory candidates who have won at Stafford.
A fearfully dull but eminently well-spent evening. The Compound
Householder was revived, and is to flourish, if he pays less than £20 in
London, or less than £10 in the country. Ms. Torºns pleaded abl
on behalf of the over rated (by which we don't mean too much praised,
but too much rated) Metropolitan. Rate-payers, and objected to new
imposition of Poor-Rate until inquiry had been made as to the extent
of present accommodation for the sick poor. M.R. HARDY advised the
putting down with a strong hand what he termed the curse of the
country—the Wilful Pauper. He would clear the workhouses of the
sick and infirm, provide for them, and make the houses a terror to the
idle. , “If any would not work, neither should he eat,” can hardly be
objected to as an un-Christian sentiment, “and PAUL’s a sound divine.”
He not only suggested but Commanded this.
Tuesday. On the Life Peerages Bill, the DUKE of ARGYLL read the
Peers a neat little, lesson on their duty to º, abreast with public
opinion. For which LoRD SALISBURY went at him with extra steam
laid on, and declared that if the Lords were to be only registrars of the
decrees of the Commons, the Duke might have the House to himself.
LoRD MALMESBURY was plaintive over the Bill, because it did not
define the precedence to be enjoyed by young ladies who might be the
daughters of life peers. This, we admit, is a question of vast import-
ance, and we regret that the Earl did not move for a Royal Commission to
inquire and report upon it. . The MARCHIONEss of PUNCH (when her
lord is a Life Peer) will certainly insist upon her daughter taking place
after the wives of the eldest sons of Marquises, who come after the
wives of Dukes of the Blood-Royal, who come after Countesses of the
United º including those Countesses of Ireland whose titles
were created, subsequent to the Union. All come after Mr. Punch,
because they love him.
“Did you tell your Mamma that Miss BoREHAM was here, my
dear?” “Yes, Papa.” “And what did she say?” “She said, “Ö
Bother!’” So said Mr. Punch when the Lords agreed to five Com-
missions for raking into the corruption at Norwich, Cashel, Bridgwater,
Beverley, and Sligo. The papers will be full of contemptible details of
the doings of cads, and knaves. Cut 'em short, dear contemporaries,
Punch begs. Dublin escapes, though as bad as the rest.
The Commons went on with the Bankruptcy Bill, which they took
i.ºilº. Much quarrel over the means by which Shylock is to
e neide
p “To cut the forfeit from that Bankrupt there.”
The Bill is thought to be at present moulded too much in the interest
of Jessica's parent: . -
. Touching the Abyssinian Bill—we mean the cost of the war—there
is to be inquiry by a Select Committee...The first estimate was Three
Millions and a Half, and we have paid Eight Millions, Seven Hundred
and Seventy-Three Thousand Pounds. Write that out in figures,
Materfamilias, and then back in words: it will fix the sum in your
memory, and enable you to hold your own (not that you can't do that
whether you know the facts of a case or not) when Paterfamilias is
lofty about masculine habits of business. SIR STAFFORD Northcote,
under whose reign the money was spent, stood up pluckily to take the
...r.º. refusing to shift any of it upon the Indian Government,
and paying a high, but merited tribute to the services rendered by SIR
SEYMoUR FITzGERALD.
In Committee on Wife's Sister, MR. CoIIINs poked fum. He moved
that a Woman should be allowed to marry her Husband's Brother, and
parodying the statements of advocates for the other change, declare
that he fº many ladies who were anxiously waiting for the justice
he asked. The House did not seem much amused, and after two divi-
sions the subject was adjourned. That there be prohibited Degrees
does not excuse such Latitudes.
Wednesday. Ireland again all day. That island is intrusive. Some-
thing about Liquors—nothing to be done. And something about
en ing Irish Fishermen at the public expense. It was said that
Irish are now as difficult to catch as Fenians. MR. AYRTON
sternly refused what was demanded, intimated that if the fishermen
were unlucky, it was because they were asses, and that he should cer-
tainly motilend them Government nets. The Telegraph puts it neatly,
that the fish have been scared away by predictions that all Ireland is
ing to become Papistical (on the passing of the I. C. B.), and will
therefore want more fish for fast-days.
Tharsday. MR. GREgoRY told a good story. Forgeries of signatures
to petitions for Sunday Museums were to two fellows, who,
notwithstanding notice of their habits, were, he said, taken into employ
by the Lord's Day Observance Society for getting up their petitions.
The Sabbatarians have denied this latter allegation. The accused
sigmataries are to come before the Beak.
reston, it was stated by MR. BRIGHT, has the most abominable rail-
way station in England, and Colon EL Yollan Dreported against it in
1866, but there is no prospect of improvement because two Companies
uarrel over their respective contributions, to a new edifice. The
reston men had spirit once—why don't they burn the atrocious station
down? That delicate hint of their opinion would be effective. If
officials interfere, É. 'em into the Ribble—there is nothing like a
perfect understanding in matters of business. .
MR. Lowe admitted that the Royal Commission on the New Law
Courts was inquiring into questions of measurement and cost, but saw
no reason for delaying legislation while we were merely ascertaining
what it ought to be.
LoRD ELCHO in a longsome but able speech advocated an Army
Reserve, and MR. CARDwell promised, reforms tending in that direc-
tion... We hereby offer last year's Punch's Pocket-Book to anybody who
can tie up eight columns tighter than in the above sentence.
This was the Ascot Cup day, and Brigantine, who won the Oaks,
won the Cup, beating Blue Gown, who won last year's Derby. If you
don’t see any fun in this, those see a lot who backed the darling
daughter of Buccaneer.
It is not Parliament—indeed the speeches are most hº
but as Mr. Punch writes a political history which will save all troub
to a future MACAULAY, he may as well mention that about this date all
sorts of Protestant meetings were held to denounce the I. C. B.,
whereat MR. GLADSTONE was called * most outrageous names,
wretch and traitor being the mildest. But he wasn’t much worsened.
Hard words usually come out of soft heads.
Friday. “A storm was coming, but the winds were still.” In anti-
iºn of the night on which the winds were to be untied and let
oose
“To fight against the Churches,”
LoRD GRANVILLE said that he was unaware of there being any founda-
tion for Menaces to which reference been made out of doors, and
that the Government had no intention of departing, from that proper
and respectful course which it was the duty of Her Majesty's Servants
to follow in dealing with either House of Parliament.
The business in the Commons was so utterly dull, that even MR.
PETERTAYLOR's taking action was a relief. He, with vast solemnity
set forth the duties of a Member of Parliament, which he expounde
to consist of the redress of grievances, the alteration of bad laws, and
the passing of good ones. Having thus portentously delivered him:
self of first principles, he promptly descended to a shilling's worth of
greens. He complained that three children had been imprisoned for
stealing the same at Salisbury. When he had made a speech of exactly
three-quarters of a column of the Star, the HomE SECRETARY explained
that MR. PETER TAYLOR knew nothing about the matter, that the
offenders were habitual thieves, and had filled a sack and three wraps
with the vegetables plundered from gardens. MR. TAYLOR could just
as easily have ascertained facts as could MR. BRUCE, and it would
have been respectful to the House not to tell it a cock-and-bull story.
The “grievance-monger” never came to sadder, grief than to-night,
and we dare say he will, for a month at least, look angrily at greens,
when they are （i. to him at dinner, which will be a pity, for they
are very wholesome, if nicely boiled.

You may do what you will with your own, but this Bill
Is the Country's, and so not your own.”

“Is the Country's, and so not your own.”

THE BITTER-SWEET TESTIMONIAL.
THE Times had a very good article the other day, in which, in refer-

disagreeable truth. Hence, they are but slightſ regarded those

and ability would regain the value, which a gentleman's statement

following plan – I
To JoHN BRowN, Esq., Candidate for a House Surgeonship.
MY DEAR BRowN,
THE Directors of St. Vitus's Hospital might do worse than
make you House Surgeon. You have been fairly educated, considering
that your family was a low one; and when * ave had more practice
in your profession I daresay you will make fewer mistakes than at
resent. I am glad also to know that you have left off the habit of
rinking, with exceptions, which I have no doubt will become less
frequent when you acquire a sense of responsibility. When the
Coroner made those remarks upon your apparent ignorance and confu;
sion of ideas, he could not know that you had been at billiards all
night, and therefore his language ought not to operate to your detri-
ment. , The patient would very likely have equally died if you had been
to see him: in fact, I think you showed humanity, in the circumstances,
in staying away. ſearnestly hope that your canvass will be as suc-
cessful as it deserves. Yours sincerely,
II FRANK BUFFER.
To MRS. SwitchER, Candidate for a Union Matronship.
MRs. *...*
I Do not hesitate to send you a testimonial, to recommend you
to the Board of Guardians of the Pickles Union, though I detect some of
your old impudence in asking it from a lady who refused to give you a
character when she discharged you from the place of Housekeeper.
We ought always to hope for the best; and though it is hoping ve
much indeed for the best to trust that you have seen your errors,
will act in the hope, though I never got back the sheets and pillow-cases.
I can certify that you are a strong, large, healthy woman, quite capable
of beating, single-handed, any she-pauper who might misconduct her-
self, and you are free from any weakness of nature that might make
you unmindful that your one duty is to save the money of the rate-
Fº: I daresay that you will have learned by this time to be respect-
ul to your superiors, and have profited by the advice of the Magistrate
before whom MR. BANG BLUNDELL brought you for defying me with
the tongs. If you had continued in intemperate habits, you could not
write so steady a hand (I suppose the letter to be in your own hand,
though you cannot forget the history of a written character you

I have nothing to say against your honesty, provided you are well
looked after, and your morals are º: by your age and
ersonal appearance... I am glad to know that you now go to church,
f hope that you will obtain the place, in which your most marked
failings will have little opportunity of displaying themselves.
MRs. BANG BLUNDELL.

To JAMEs JoNEs, Esq., Candidate for a Head-Mastership.
DEAR Jon Es,
I CAN consistently recommend you to the favourable notice of
the Trustees of the Smotheringham Grammar School... I consider you
#. the kind of Master required in these times of progress. Not
evoted to any particular study, you have a catholic feeling for all.
Were you a sound classic, you might be tempted to neglect mathe-
matics, and were you much acquainted with the latter, Latin and Greek
might not be duly attended to by your pupils; Did you know anything
of physical science, you might lead your charges to materialism, or
worse, and were you a professor of any particular religion, there would
be danger lest you should inculcate intolerance. As regards your
temper, I have no doubt that your good sense will teach you, eventu-
ally, to control it, and the lesson will be enforced by your recollection
of having been expelled from your last situation for flogging an entire
class because you spilt the ink over your trousers. "º.
educated, you will be qualified to educate others, and I shall doubly

will then have no reason to neglect, and partly for my own sake, as

A CHANCE FOR OLD GIRLS.
GRANDMAMMA, are you tired of the life you have led so many years
as a widow If so, here is a chance for you offered in an advertisement
which appeared the other day in a newspaper:—
ATRIMONY, -Social
independence, desirous of an introduction to the higher circles (through
An interview with a
osition—Any Widow or Single Lady of
lady friend, if preferred.
Perhaps the above extractis an º which some ladies at your
time of life, Grandmamma, would think .# desirable indeed. It ma
be an opportunity which they would derive from marriage with an insol-
vent old nobleman, or even an insolvent young one, and one not onl
oung, but handsome. The only question for them to consider, if .#
ing to marry purely for social position, is whether, º got
through marriage, an introduction to the higher circles, they Could
hold their own in them. That would depend. For instance, unless
very wealthy indeed, so as to be able to empower their husbands to
exercise splendid hospitality, it would be indispensable for them not to
be given to drop their hºs.
rom the tenor, however, of this advertisement, addressed to
marriageable women indiscriminately, saving independence, you may
safely conclude that the advertiser (a .# Peer, perhaps) is not at all
particular, at any rate as to personal qualifications. Therefore, with a
view to treating with him, it will be quite unnecessary for you to go to
the expense of ii. made, as doubtless you can be, although MADAME
RACHEL is in prison, just as well as you could if she were at large,
beautiful for ever.
You see that either he is not under any apprehension that the
Married Women's Property Bill may become law, or does not care if it
will. Very likely does not care. . He may be presumed to be a gentle-
man, if not also a nobleman, whose purpose will be quite sufficientl
answered by any marriage which will insure him, as Dr. Johnson j
the certainty of three meals a day.
There, Granny!
A Great Oversight.
“Some disturbances of no great importance have occurred at Besancon,
owing to the authorities having seized an electoral address of M. ORDINAIRE,
an Opposition Candidate. Several bands of people marched about the
streets up till two in the morning [shouting] ‘Wive ORDINAIRE l’”
WHAT a fine opportunity for a judicious misprint was here missed.
It should have been “Win Ordinaire l’”

not to be concluded, began, after they had hissed off a man
in the area with a green tie, according to report:—
“‘The QUEEN' was now loudly cheered, while the mention of
‘BRIGHT" and ‘GLADSTone's ' names provoked a terrific storm
of disapprobation. ‘LoRD DERBY’ and ‘GATHoRNE HARDY’
were cheered again and again, as were also the “Bishop of
OxFort D’ and “DR. PUSEY.’”
When our young friends cheered DR. WILBERFoRCE and
DR. Pusey, it could not have occurred to them that what
they have to thank the latter for, is the inability of the
parsons to poke up the British Lion against the Ministers
whose names and policy were hooted on Wednesday last
in the Sheldonian Theatre. They will probably live to
find out that, whatever ulterior measures F.
statesmen may adopt with regard to Church and State, the
influence exercised by the Puseyites and the Ritualists will
have rendered it impossible among the People of England

tion. Could not that powerful illuminator, the Magnesium

FLAME from close proximity to the º workings”? Safety
Magnesium lamps placed in different parts of a mine would
be costly, no doubt, but the consumer would pay the
charge, and every fire would burn the brighter when it was
known that the coals had been obtained with lessened
danger to the poor miner.

THE Members of the “Nulli Secundus” Club had their
annual dinner on Saturday evening at the London Tavern,
Bishopsgate Street. It is not generally known that this
distinguished Society derived the name of Nulli Secundus
from having declared their determination never to sanction

TOUCHING A RECITAL. -
DEAR PUNCH, - - - -
I was a solicitor once. But, becoming conscientious, I of
course renounced that calling. . . - -
I remember that when I made Deeds, I had to put in Recitals. They
were of no use, but awfully easy and splendidly profitable. I need not
explain what they were, except that they were verbiage... Justifiable
however, because I was inadequately paid for what really demanded
skill. and was useful. - -
The other day I went to listen to a Recital at the St. James's Hall.
It was not in the least like mine. It was made by MADAME ARABELLA
GoDDARD, to whose name you rhymed-
“Her with admiration all the critical squad heard.”
It was not easy at all, except to listen to, for, it was Music of the
highest class. I hope it was profitable—certainly there was a first-rate
audience. The lady’s playing is one of those things which you can't
puff, for you can’t praise it enough. It is per se... I wish you would
go and hear the next—there is only one more...MR. BENEDICT sits
near her all the time, which I should say was taking an unfair advan-
tage (for I don’t believe he pays for his seat), only that everybody can
hear every note as well as MR. BENEDICT can. Also he accompanies
a very nice young lady Miss EDMONDs, who sings charmingly. Upon
my word, I wish you d go and hear a Recital. You'd t me for

THE PROFoundest CoNVICTION OF THE Ex-MEMBER FOR SHEF-
FIELD.—That RoeBUCK and He-roe are two names for the same thing.
FASHIONABLE SUICIDE.
“WHAT fools there are in the world !” will be a natural reflection
by the philosophic mind on learning the morsel of intelligence sub-
joined:–
“An American paper says that nearly all the brilliant complexions seen
among the fashionable women of New York are the result of eating arsenic.
Since the introduction of the blonde fashion, arsenic eating has become almost
a mania.”
“Almost a mania” seems rather a mild phrase. A person who can
swallow poison for the sake of her complexion must be either quite a
maniac or else a downright idiot. But this is not the only proof of
modern fashionable insanity. Some ladies take poison to beautify their
eyes, and others, dye their hair, with poisonous decoctions., Beauties
without paint will swallow deadly drugs to give a charm to their com-
Piº and will run the risk of killing themselves in order to look
jºi. Tight-lacing is another form of fashionable suicide, and annu-
ally slaughters a hecatomb of victims. Indeed, the wonder is that
ladies who only care to live in order to be looked at, have vitality
sufficient to keep them in existence, while their life is so imperilled by
the means which they employ for the enhancement of their beauty.

TO PLAYGOERS.
HE Midsummer holidays are at
hand, and heads of families must
now be thinking of the annual
visit to the sea-side. Many of
them will hear with satisfaction
that all the expense and trouble
of a journey to the coast may
be saved by merely walking or
driving to Long Acre, to the
cool and comfortable Queen's
Theatre, where every evening,
at half-past eight, The Turn f
the Tide can be seen and enjoyed,
without the drawback of lodging-
houses, bathing machines, impor-
tunate boatmen, itinerant min-
strels, and rainy weather.
Let no one be deterred from
going, through alarm at “four
acts, ten scenes, and four
tableaux.” The acts are not too
long, the intervals between them
commendably short, and the
tableaux very striking, parti-
cularly “The Cave of Morgane”
(no connection with any other
“cave”), to which the only objection that can be taken is, that, as the
most exciting scene in the piece, it, occurring as it does in the first act
comes too early upon the stage. (N.B. For the best thunder an
lightning, go to the Queen’s.)
The story interests—its seriousness being relieved by the amusement
Mr. and Mrs. Danby, admirably represented by MR. and MRs. FRANK
MATTHEws, afford. The acting of it is good; notably by MR. H.
VEZIN, MR. J. CLAYTON, MR. RYDER, Miss Hodson, and Miss
LARKIN. The scenery is beautiful, the dialogue has many telling
points, and the handsome costumes—well, they are scarcely an exag-
geration of the present hunchy-bunchy style of dress. It would have
been better could Lady Clara's death have been managed of the stage,
but this tragic close to her unhappy life has, we imagine, been made
much less disa ethan when the drama was first brought out.
We hope it will bring the tide of success to the Queen's, and that MR.
BURNAND, who in *:::::...". plot of which is founded, as he tells
us, on a novel publis some years ago—makes, we believe, his first
experiment in serious dramatic º: be encouraged again to

THE BAR FEMININE.
(Respectfully but remonstratively recommended to the notice of John
STUART MILL.)
Is this, we earnestly ask, in the name of cruelty to legal animals
what Court and Clients must be prepared for when ſº are admitted
to practice at the Bar?
“The SHEDDEN legitimacy case was resumed this morning for the fifteenth
time before the House of Lords. The LoRD CHANCELLoR commented upon
the extreme prolicity of Miss SHEDDEN's address, which has maw occupied
fourteen days, and exhorted her to confine her remarks to the evidence.
Shortly after commencing to address their Lordships this morning Miss
SHEDDEN swooned, and was carried out. DR. Bond being sent for, testified
that the lady was suffering from hysteria brought on by nervous exhaustion.
Their Lord º postponed the case till to-morrow, when, if Miss SHEDDEN
should be unable to proceed, her father will be heard.”
Let us hope MR. SHEDDEN Senior will be to the fore, or Heaven only
knows when their Lordships will be released.
“. . . . . sedet acternumque sedebit,
Infeliz CHELMsFoºd.”
“Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis avum,

Talk of “the Subjection of Women,” MR. MILL! Here’s the whole
force of Law Lords in subjection to one woman.... who, after
fifteen days, talks herself into hysteria, and their Lordships into—but
what single word can be found comprehensive enough to describe their
Lordships' state of body and mind, under the peine forte et dure of this
distressingly fluent female. Fancy a Bar of Miss SHEDDENs! The
masculine legal mind recoils in horror from the idea!

panion volume to “Historic Winepins.”
LE FOLLET RAISONNABLE.
Is Orson endowed with reason? Considering, however, that Orson
was a creature very much the reverse of a Warrisºn, perhaps we
should not ask that question, as of him, concerning a man-milliner, or
| may be even a milliner and not a man. But in Le Follet’s account of
the “Fashions for June” there are no less than three distinct traces
of positive rationality. Imprimis. Having stated that the immense
variety of new materials for finery renders it impossible to enumerate
them, our papilionaceous contemporary proceeds:–
“We find, however, that foulard of different kinds is very fashionable,
more especially the “Celeste-Empire,” which has the texture and brilliancy
of China crapes; and the new Japanese, a kind of silk cloth which does not
crumple easily, and is not injured by a shower of rain.”
Lest Le Follet should get more credit than its due, it is proper to
mention that the italics which, above and below, mark passages dis-
tinctly rational, are not in the original. The next instance of reason,
in Le Follet, is this:–
“There is a new manner of making long dresses into short ones by merely
looping them up with bows of a darker shade than the material. This looping
up may, of course, be done in a variety of styles; thus a dress may answer two
purposes—for walking or dinner toilette—by having two bodies.’
mºnomy with elegance; actual economy | Here is example the
“Dinner or visiting dress of torquoise blue silk, made very long, looped up
or not according to taste, by means of bows of ribbon of a deeper shade place
at the sides. This arrangement admits of the dress being worn either for
dinner or visiting.”
If the man who makes two blades of wheat grow where only one
i. before deserves well of his country, what does not he or she
eserve of fathers and husbands who is the means of making one dress
for a wife or a daughter answer the purpose of two Nor less meri-
torious in their eyes will be the service rendered in the inducement, b
authoritative recommendation, of daughters and wives to wear º:
dresses, and also the equally eligible dress consisting of “a kind of silk
cloth which does not crumple easily, and is not injured by a shower of
rain.” The author or authoress of these recommendations may be sup-
posed to have lately taken the benefit of a temporary residence at some
such an institution as the one that is now, in testimony to the progress
of the nation, being enlarged at Earlswood. Some germs of thought,
somehow, have been evidently developed in that person’s mind.
It must be cheering to the breadwinner, who is also the muslin-
winner and silk and satin winner of a female family, to note that the
use of articles of wearing-apparel which will, s a little rain is
growing amongst girls. hen you come to think of the present style
of chignon, you will begin to see that, provided it is natural hair, and
does not come from the gaol or the workhouse or the hospital, it is by
no means so absurd a head-dress, nor anything like so grotesque as
you may have considered it at first. Whilst it subserves all the use of
a bonnet, it utterly defies the wet, and by its possibility of being occa-
sionally reconstructed and trimmed with changes of beads and bows of
ribbon, is capable of being transformed into no end of novelties. It
might thus be made to last the wearer all her life, or at least as long as
; signifies what she wears; for the term, at any rate, of her natural
eauty.
PERSONAL GRATITUDE TO PERSONAL GOVERNMENT.
MR. PUNCH could not understand the reason why such a rush of
letters came to him from France, demanding the instant transmission
thither of his number containing the Cartoon of the EMPEROR, as
L’Homme qui Rit, looking at the Election Urn. French people are not
usually in such a hurry to obtain, at the cost of eightpence, the sight
of a picture which they can see for nothing. . At last his eye lighted on
a paragraphin the excellent letter of the Globe's French correspondent.
The Minister had ordered the number to be seized in the cafés. The
Minister is most cordially thanked, and should he be in England (with
his present master) when the next Punch's Pocket Book, comes out,
Mr. Punch intends to present them with a copy each in token of grati-
tude for a handsome donation.
A Cry Amongst the Clerics.
O BRETHREN, for the power, by hook or crook,
Critics, who freely dare our views to handle,
To bring with boundless licence, all to book,
And duly curse them by bell, book, and candle !
Extraordinary OBESITY.
The visitors to the late Horse-Show at Islington included three agri-
culturists, whose united weights amounted to thirty-nine score.

ODE TO UTILITY.
(On MR. CowPER's Commons Preservation Bill.)
MATERIAL Utility, .
With what a wise servility
For thy substantial wages labour we,
And with no brute stupidity,
No grovelling cupidity,
All things of beauty sacrifice to thee!
The progress of machinery
Is fast improving scenery. .
From off the face of this industrious isle.
The railways are victorious,
And architecture glorious
About each station thriving builders pile.
Where once, in ages drearier,
Stood groves, stand shops superior,
The public-house shoots up where bloomed the thorn.
Soon will arise dense villages
On land that under tillage is,
Where the red poppy clots the growing corn.
The landscape, in the olden time,
By owls esteemed a golden time,
Adorned with spires that pointed to the sky,
Exhibits now, in lieu of them,
Tall chimneys, not a few of them,
Whose factory smoke conceals it from each eye.
Then with our whole ability
For thee we’ll slave, Utility,
Using old England up by swift degrees,
All our green fields—coal measures too—
Yielding ourselves those pleasures to
Pigs which engross and make mankind Chinese.

THE disgraceful and contemptible figure cut now and
lately by so many insolvent, sporting members, of the
Peerage, suggests a question which MR. SoTHERN, the next
time, he plays Lord Dundreary, may ask as a “widdle.” If
a nobleman who is a racing º were to take to honest
industry and turn respectable workman, what workman
would he begin with being P A Turf-cutter.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
IT is universally admitted by all who have the faintest excuse for
calling themselves Rational Beings, that though, it is entirely impos-
sible to predict the mode in which Mr. Punch will deal with any ques-
tion whatever, it is *...* certain that such mode will be profoundly
wise and exquisitely graceful. ... With this wholly inadequate tribute to
himself, which does but echo the voice of admiring Creation, he takes
leave to introduce his account of the Great Debate which occupied the h
House of Lords last week. He proposes, in some degree to depart
from his ordinary—yet extraordinary-method of condensing Parlia-
mentary eloquence. He does this, partly because were he to deal out
but a Modicum-neuter Latin noun, signifying a little—of justice to
each of the orations which have been delivered by the Peers, his present
number would comprise .# but Essence of Senate. Chiefly, how-
ever, because in the exercise of that brilliant and unerring judgment
which is among his myriad merits, the topic and tone of the debate in
question, do not lend themselves so readily to his coruscating wit and
scintillating sarcasm as do most discussions in both branches of the
I.egislature. His lamented contributor and friend, the late ARTEMUs
WARD, with much good, taste, declined to make jokes about the
Rocky Mountains, as may be seen in his famous Lecture, just hand-
somely published. In the same spirit, Mr. Punch holds that though as
a rule, the Peers themselves gain enormously by his criticisms, which
indeed have notoriously educated the House of Lords up to its present
standard, and kept it well with the nation, the present occasion is one
on which he may satisfactorily discharge his magnificent duty by a
calm and just record of incidents. The Great Council has been worthil
discussing questions on which Mr. Punch never thinks lightly, an
therefore never speaks lightly:
“For Punch is He who always speaks his thougnt,
And always thinks the very thing he ought.”
The debate has been upon MR. GLADSTONE's Bill for Disestablishing
and Disendowing the Protestant Church in Ireland. The question was
Wol. LVI.-1869.
|Church, and place themselves in a
whether the Lords should read this Bill a Second Time, with a view to
the introduction of alterations which the Conservatives would consider
amendments, or whether the measure should be rejected altogether.
The battle raged for four long nights, and Thirty-Seven nobles spoke.
They may be assorted into three, divisions., Ministerialists, under
LoRD GRANVILLE, supported the Bill as a whole. Conservatives, under
LoRD DERBY (still }. virtual head of the party nominally led by
LoRD CAIRNs) opposed the Bill as a whole. Conservatives and some
Liberals, under F. SALISBURY, held, first, that the national will
ad been so clearly expressed at the elections, and by the large
majority in the Commons, that it did not befit the Lords to reject
the º and secondly, that they might obtain better terms, for the
etter attitude, in regard to the
country, by accepting the º: of the Bill, altering it in Com-
mittee, and throwing upon the Ministers the responsibility of refusing
the amendments. An intelligent Public and a studious Posterity
will, by this exposition, precisely comprehend the struggle in June,
1869. -
Some of the speeches will be Historical. To those only—with a few
exceptions—is it Mr. Punch's intention to advert with any detail. But
it is due to every Peer who spoke in this debate to say that all appeared
to be impressed with a sense of the importance and even solemility of
the theme, and that though every legitimate weapon of attack and
defence was used with the best skill a.combatant, chanced to possess,
the battle was fought with chivalry. Both the Established Church of
Ireland, and the Irish People must feel that the case was amply and
admirably argued, that the very utmost was done on both sides, and
that this º: to be the Final Hearing of the great cause.

[JUNE 26, 1869
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LoRD CLARENDON (Minister) spoke for, and the DUKE of RUTLAND
against it. -
LoRD STRATFoRD DE REDCLIFFE, so long our famous Minister
at Constantinople, “the great Eltohi’’, of MR. KINGLAKE, dis-
believed that the Bill by itself would conciliate the Irish, but in pre-
sence of the elections verdict advised its being accepted, though he
would reject it later unless much i. -
LoRD Romilly (Master of the Rolls) argued, as became a judge, that
the measure was just.
The ARchbishop of CANTERBURY (DR.TAIT) made the most import:
ant speech of the night. The Primate of All England accepted the Bill
for the Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, but he desired to
make it much better. It must be made more acceptable to the Pro-
testants of Ireland. Of the voluntary system he disapproved, as it put the
minister in a false position in regard to the flock whom he ought to guide.
LoRD CARNARvoN (Conservative) would endeavour to introduce
more generous terms, but it was impossible to resist the Bill. . .
The Bishop of DERRY (DR. ALEXANDER) utterly—and dashingly—
denounced it.
Tuesday. LoRD LYTTON was expected to * but gave way to . .
LoRD GREY. The raising the question had done dire mischief in
Ireland, but it was raised, and must be dealt with. A worse, Bill
would follow rejection. Let the Lords accept with dignity, and let
not the Ministers be hard and arrogant.
The ARchbishop of DUBLIN (DR. TRENCH) took an attitude of com-
plaint against ungenerous and illiberal treatment of the Church.
The Bishop of St. DAVID's (DR. CoNNop THIRLWALL, b. 1797) made
one of the great speeches of the debate. He tore to ". the super-
stitions about sacrilege, praised St. Ambrose, who sold the holy vessels
to ransom Christians, laughed at the idea of the Pope as a scare-crow,
and pointed out that Popery was crumbling in every civilised country.
He thought the Irish Church unsuited for its purpose, and in the way
of religious and political peace. By no means giving unqualified
approval to the Bill, he would accept and amend it.
!he Law Lords, Čičiusrown and PENZANCE (the latter the Judge in
Divorce, who now made his maiden speech) argued, the first for, the
second against the Bill, and the DUKE of Rich Mond reluctantly sepa-
rated himself from his Conservative friends, and was for reading the
Bill, though it was one of violence, injustice, and spoliation.
The Bishop of PETERBoRough (DR. MAGEE) then delivered, against
the Bill, one of the most splendid orations that ever delighted an assembly.
Friends and opponents united in admiration of the eloquent Irishman.
Let LoRD DERBY, himself a master of oratory, and one who has heard
all the great men of the last half-century, be the critic. “Its fervid
eloquence, and impassioned and brilliant language have never in my
memory been surpassed, and rarely equalled.” The peroration was a
most solemn reference to the one Tribunal that can judge the motives,
as well as the actions of men.
EARL DE GREY (Minister) supported, LoRD CLANCARTY opposed.
LoRD Monck (one of the proposed Commissioners under the Bill)
§: that Voluntaryism had failed in Canada, of which he has been
OVernor.
Thursday. The EARL OF DERBY, in a speech of touching earnestness,
assailed the Bill with all his force, and thus ended:–
* . M. Lords, I am now an old man, and, like many of your Lordships, passed
the allotted span of threescore years and ten. My official life is at an end;
my political life is nearly closed, and, in the course of nature, my natural life
cannot be long. That natural life commenced at the period of the great rebel-
lion in Ireland, which immediately preceded the union between the two
countries. God grant that it may not close with the renewal of rebellion.
My Lords, I do not pretend to look at the prospect of the distant future. But,
whatever may be the result of your Lordships' consideration of this measure,
for my own part, if it be for the last time I now have the honour of addressin
}. Lordships, I declare that it will be to my dying day a satisfaction º;
ave been able to lift my voice against the adoption of a measure the political
impolicy of which is only equalled by its moral iniquity.”
Ilord KIMBERLEY (Minister) supported the Bill, the Bishop of
RIPON (DR. BICKERSTETH), thought it morally wrong, the DUKE of
CLEVELAND was in favour of it as a whole, LoRD REDESDALE dwelt on
the Coronation Oath, and quoted Malachi, the DUKE of DEvoNSHIRE
disliked Voluntaryism, but disliked an anomaly more.
The MARQUIs of SALISBURY made one of the great speeches. He
demolished, the pleas raised on the Union, and the Oath, and held that
it was the duty of that House to defer to the national will when it had
been well ascertained. There was no honour in resisting the will of
the nation. He was not afraid of any of the consequences that had
been menaced in case of rejection, but he was afraid of the verdict of
history, if the Lords iºſi abandon their high rank and become a
faction. The provision for the Church was ungenerous, and must be
improved.
ord ColchestER opposed, LoRD STANHoPE (LORD MAHON, histo-
rian) strongly supported a Second Reading, the Bishop of TUAM
(DR. BERNARD) opposed, and LoRD NELSON, who said he had always
stuck by his party, and was no coward, would nevertheless read the
measure a Second Time.
Friday. EARL Russell, who may have felt a sensation (only suc-
cesses usually come too late for such feelings) on occasion of the great
wish of his life being, at last in course of accomplishment, delivered a
long and interesting historical speech, which everybody should read-
dwelt on the fact that the Catholics were the great majority in Ireland,
and demanded justice for them. He liked not the title of the Bill,
nor the disendowment, nor the application of the surplus. The measure
must be improved.
The DUKE of ABERçoRN (late Lord Lieutenant) strongly opposed
the Bill, and described it as the work of MR. GLADstoNE only.
The DUKE of ARGYLL, on the other hand, described it as the natural
offspring of Emancipation. A closely reasoned speech, boldly delivered.
The Bishop of Lichfield (DR. SELwYN, of New Zealand) was very
manly and genial. He had lived and worked where, there was no
Establishment, and was impartial, but no case had been made out
against the Irish Church, Like the other, Bishops, he introduced
humorous touches, and finished with a hope that religious conciliation
was at hand, and that the dove of peace would build her nest in the
tiara of a Disestablished Pope.
LoRD WESTBURY's was a sarcastic speech against the Bill, and he
displayed much acquaintance with the language of Scripture. He was
for distributing the Church property among all the religions.
The Lord CHANCELLOR (Lord HATHERLEY—MR. PAGE WooD)
delivered a calm and able oration for the Bill.
LQRD CAIRNs made an exceedingly long speech, in which he vigo-
rously pleaded for justice to the Protestants of Ireland, who had been
taken thither under a solemn compact that their religion should be
maintained, who had turned Ulster from a wilderness into a garden,
and who represented nearly all that was good in Ireland.
EARL GRANVILLE º, briefly (for he rose at a quarter to three on
Saturday morning), and again asked the House to accept the Bill,
“subject to any amendments which your Lordships may think fit to
propose.” - -
The LoRD CHANCELLOR put the question. “Your Voices, Lords.”
For the Second Reading . . . 179
Against it . . . . . . 146
Majority for Second Reading . . Thirty-Three.
So ended the ablest debate which, it has fallen to Mr. Punch to
describe since he began the Immortal Analysis which is justly regarded
as one of the chief institutions of the country. The Committee was
fixed for Tuesday next, the 29th June.
One episode varied the debate. It is explained and illustrated in the
Cartoon so admirably that it is only necessary for Mr. Punch to record
that the PRESIDENT of THE BoARD or TRADE thought proper to
write a letter to Birmingham, calling the Lords not very wise, but
hinting that out of their unwisdom profit might come to the people.
“If they delayed the Irish Church Bill three months, they would stimu-
late discussions on important questions which but for their Infatuation
might slumber for years.” Called over the coals by CAIRNs, who de-
manded, at the length of Chancery Interrogatories (as they used to be)
whether Ministers shared their colleague's sentiments, Lord GRAN-
VILLE could but shrug his shoulders lº. and say that MR.
BRIGHT was “John Bullish.” Lord Russell, said that they might
despise the irregular shot of an Awkward Volunteer who had ſired
without leave. That suffices—Punch dislikes Pleonasm. -
The Commons sat, but no man regarded them. They were doing
their duty, however, with Bankruptcy, Endowed Schools, and other
important matters, and their yirtue must be its own reward, for, Mr.
Punch's lungs are full of the air of Olympus, and he cannot spend his
sacred breath in the plain.
Liberality of Convocation.
. The following item of intelligence, apart from any context, appears
in a contemporary:-
“Convocation is to be asked to make a grant of £1,000 for apparatus for the
new building for Experimental Philosophy, under the care of PROF. CLIFTon.”
... There are, as everybody knows, Convocations and Convocations; but
if Convocation were simply Convocation, you would wonder who could
be simple enough to think of asking it to do anything so liberal and
sensible as granting a sum of money for the promotion of practical
SC1011C0.
Change of Name.
ONE of the gentlemen to be nominated for the office of Sheriff of
London and Middlesex for the ensuing year bears, the name of
VALENTIN. The election takes place on the 24th, known in the
Calendar as Midsummer Day, but which will this year be commonly
spoken of in the City as Walentin's Day !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW USE FOR A BIRD’S NEST.
HERE are people who
have plenty of money
in their pockets but
who are often sadly
puzzled as to how they
are to spend it. Hence
we see in many such
extravagance in dress,
and hence we hear
that ladies who have
little to occupy their
time employ it very
largely in trying on
new bonnets. For the
same reason, we doubt
not, the invention of
the modistes is con-
tinually taxed to bring
out striking novelties,
such as that which is
thus noticed by a Paris
Correspondent:—
“Nor must we forget
to mention the birds'-
nest hats, a sort of puffs of moss with blades of grass and fern, and with delicate flowers, such as
wood anemones and forget-me-nots. Upon the nest, there is a pretty little bird with out-spread wings:
So far one has not yet imagined to put eggs within the nest. That will come perhaps; one will
also, no doubt, put little j in it, opening wide their beaks, to receive their food.”
_T
Nrd's-nest soup in China is a not uncommon delicacy; but until we read this extract, we
newes should have dreamed of seeing birds'-nest hats and bonnets. Strange are the uses
of prosperity. You may use anything you F. in any way you like, if you have but
wealth or rank enough to influence the fashions. For the mere sake of the novelty, rich
people put a thing to usage such as, but for their prosperity, would never have been dreamed
LORD ROCHDALE,
SoME politicians, rather too hard upon John
BRIGHT for his little epistolary mistake with
respect, or rather by ºr lady, with disrespect,
to the House of Lords, have urged that he
ought to resign his post in the Ministry as Pre-
sident of the Board of Trade. The country can-
not afford to dispense with the services which
MR. BRIGHT is able to render it in that capacity,
and has begun to show that he is willing as
well as able by consenting to the appointment
of a Select Committee on the Adulteration of
Seeds Bill, whence it may be hoped that he will
also concur, with any legislative attempt that
may be made to rectify railway mismanagement,
and deter fraudulent shopkeepers from the use
of false weights and measures.
If it were possible and expedient that the
Honourable Member for Birmingham should
withdraw from the Board of Trade, his retention
of some office in a Liberal Cabinet would be still
desirable. Then, in that case, the position most
suitable for him to occupy would clearly be that
of the PRESIDENT of THE CouncIL. No doubt
the present holder of that dignity would readily
vacate it in favour of MR. BRIGHT who, of course,
would have to be raised to the House of Lords.
And why not? Because of his dyslogistic letter
touching their Lordships? That is the very
reason why he ought to have a seat among
them, where he would be enabled to fill a part of
the void, and perform, one of the uses of
BROUGHAM, in telling, the Peers occasionally,
unpleasant truths to their face. MR. BRIGHT
might be created EARL OF Roch DALE.

TEMPERANCE IN JERUSALEM.
In the Clerical House of Commons, which met in the Jerusalem
Chamber on Tuesday last week, ARchdEAcon DENIsox having said
that he had a gravamen of his own to ºn', solemnly protesting
against the principle of the Irish Church Bill:—
“After several petitions for the Reform of Convocation in respect of the
representation of the clergy had been presented, the House took into conside-
ration the report on intemperance, prepared by a committee of Convocation of
which the ARCHDEAcon of Coventhy was the chairman.”
Subsequently, notwithstanding this discussion touching the subject
of intemperance, the excellent but irritable Archdeacon, first of those
two above named, when, whilst he was speaking on the Irish Church
Bill, some of his hearers cried “Question!” could not refrain from
saying:—
“There are some cries of ‘Question.” Now let me say to you, that if you
begin to call ‘Question,' I shall stay here till to-morrow night. If you wish
to save time, you had better listen to what I have to say.”
At a later, period of the debate, wanting to º again, amid cries
of “Divide!” ARCHDEAcon DENIsoN exclaimed:—
“You shall divide when I have spoken, but not before.”
He was º by the Prolocutor to be out of order. In the
meanwhile DR. JEBB, in seconding a motion, had said that:—
“He would endeavour to be as moderate in his language as possible, for
such, were his feelings on this question that if he should speak the words
which would most truly express his views, those words would i. actionable.”
Accordingly, sailing not very far from the legal wind, the reverend
Doctor went on as follows:–
“The Church of Ireland had no opportunity of expressing ner views as a
Church upon the matter which affected her so nearly, and the opportunity to
do so had been refused by that man who had introduced this Bill, and he was
one who had forfeited the respect of the country—(Order!)—and was not to be
trusted with a single thing when the interests of two parties were concerned.”
After all this abuse, MR. GLADstone would show magnanimity in
making DR. JEBB a Dean. He could not, for reasons presently to be
mentioned, very well make him a Bishop. The report above quoted
continues to state that:—
“The speaker proceeded, amid renewed cries of ‘Order!’ to use expressions
to the effect that all who supported the Bill should be cut off from private
friendship; that he himself could not act with the man who supported the
Bill—for those who supported the measure could not have the least spark of
honesty or principle.”
Hereupon :-
“The Prolocutor rose and called the Doctor to order.”
It would not exactly do for the PREMIER to heap coals of fire on the
head of the clergyman who scolded him so violent }. Convocation, by
placing a mitre on that of DR. JEBB, because DR. JEBB could not
possibly, by his own account, act, with the ARCHBishop of CANTER-
#URY or the Bishop of St. DAVID's, and perhaps would appear in too
striking contrast, with them, as well as with the Bishop of PETER-
Borough, with whom he could and would act, on the same, bench.
The subject of intemperance is one which Convocation may be con-
gratulated on having discussed before that of the Irish Church Bill;
for otherwise, after the outbreaks of ARCHDEACON DENIsoN, an
DR. JEBB's invectives upon the latter rubject, most people would have
considered that the less that had been said about the former in that
Assembly the better.
The Wrong of Petition.
IN the notice of the debate in the House of Commons, on the ques-
tion of Opening Public Museums, &c.; on Sunday, the following
instructive statement occurs:—“Bigg deposed that he had filled in
200.fictitious signatures [to a petition], and that at 13, Cook's Court,
from 12 to 20 persons had been occupied for more than three weeks
filling in fictitious signatures.” Thus it seems that petitions as well as
accounts can be cooked.
the Abuse OF JUSTICE.
THE Law Lords have been sitting for about twenty days hearing
Miss SHEDDEN conduct her own case. Reasonably enough, they
appear to have grown a little tired of such a S(h)eddentary life.

You remember hearing your distinguished friend, the late LoRD MELBourne
say, speaking of another distinguished friend of yours, -“I wish I were as certain
of anything as ToM MacAulay is about everything.” My own habit of mind
Sir, resembles that avowed by the former one of those two of your distinguishe
friends; I am not only uncertain of the truth, but also of the untruth, of any;
thing that, so far as I can see, may or may not true. For instance, I am not
º certain that there may not be some proportion of truth amidst a great
eal of mis-statement, and not a little § in the published accounts of the facts
alleged in Fº of the persuasion termed Spiritualism. On the other hand, I
suspect, and if I had to “back § own opinion by a wager,” should elect to bet,
that not even one rap upon a table, ascribed to spiritual force, has ever been really
caused by any other agency than that of a fraudulent "medium.”
On the subject of “spirit” photographs, however, I am º to say that I
ºlo feel a satisfactory degree of certainty. There may be, for aught I know, disem-
bodied spirits. I i. not know that disembodied spirits, if they exist, have not
the power of making themselves visible. A visible spirit could be ºº::
as well as anything else. But º pretended to see the spirits that MUMLER
pretended to photograph. The idea that an object not luminous enough to form
an image on the retina, could reflect rays of light sufficiently strong to decompose
§§ chemicals, is one of which the suggestion must make Credulity
itself exclaim, “Walker!” and can hardly, perhaps, be seriously entertained even
by MR. Howitt. -
Of course ºpiº are all humbug; but the ability to give a reason

ogic of the Ladies' Gallery Question.
The principle on which ladies are screened off by a grating in the House of
mmons...is much the same as that whereon negroes are restricted to nigger-
cars on railways in the United States. Therefore—understand intervening premisses
—the grating of the Ladies' Gallery ought to be abolished. -
. But the negroes, in the United States are not too beautiful, whereas the ladies
in England are. Therefore the grating ought to be retained.

instantly, and make frequent use of it. ...Very possibly the abuse of
England which the Yankee papersteem with, is in a very great measure
occasioned by the contemptuous avoidance of their Phººl
novelties which the higher part of our Press persists in. If the lead-
# literary organs of this country will only follow the example of their
inferiors in adopting every American addition to the English language
as soon as it comes over, and employing it on every possible occasion,
they will perhaps do far more than they could by any argument towards
a settlement of the Alabama “ difficulty,” and the establishment of

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
THE worst of WIGTHORPE is, that he’s a fellow who never has any
change. I make this note the day after our French dinner. I had
never met WIGTHORPE before in London: always in the country, at
somebody else's house, where, of course, one didn't want change.
He proposes a cab up to the French restaurant. It’s somewhere in
Soho, and will only be, he says, “a shilling's-worth.” A Hansom
asses; its driver looking the other way. ... I don't like to shout in
egent Street, so I hail him with my umbrella. He passes on. Three
Hansoms pass on, all looking the other way. One trots up with no
one inside. He sees me, but shakes his head, and doesn't stop. Why
is this? WIGTHORPE says, it's, because he’s going home. I say it’s
impudence. I say I should like to have taken his number. IG-
THORPE wants to know what I should have done with it. ... I reply, had
him up. On consideration I don’t know where I should have had him
up, or what I should have charged him with. The charge might have
been for going home, and not taking me. I stop another. e get in.
As WIGTHORPE doesn't know the name of the place he is going to, he
tells him to drive along Oxford Street, and he’ll direct him whenever
he has to turn. .
WIGTHORPE is a fidgety fellow. Odd that I never noticed this
before. He keeps popping forward to see where the turning is. He
hits up the little trap-door, under the driver's nose, suddenly, and
shouts out, “To the right !” then he directs him with his umbrella.
Very intricate place, Soho. We are perpetually turning from right to
left, and left to right, down little streets. At last we º at a shabby;
looking restaurant. “ Now, * boy,” says WIGTHORPE, heartily, “I’ll
ive you a French dinner.” e jumps out, and enters the house. If
pay the cabman now, I can settle, with Wigmoirs afterwards. A
married man must be careful. When I was a bachelor, a trifle like
eighteenpence (it isn't “a shilling's-worth”) wouldn’t have mattered.
Happy. Thought-He says he’ll give me a French dinner. I wonder
if I º dining with him, or whether we’re dining together? Delicate
question.
Happy. Thought.—Better not ask. Take it for granted that I’m
dining with him.
. I follow him in, along a narrow º: At the end of the passage
is a perspiring man in a white nightcap, backed by stewpans and black
pots. He salutes WIGTHORPE, and we pass into the dining-room.
In an off-hand way (just like WIGTHoRPE, now I know him) he stops
as he is opening the door, to ask me, “Did you pay the cabman?”. I
reply that I did, expecting him to offer his share. He answers, “Ah,
that's all right, as I hadn't any change.” I think (to myself) he’s evi.
dently giving me the dinner, as he has brought a note out with him,
and no small jº He takes off his hat to a respectable-lookin
woman standing behind a counter, and informs me that it’s a Frenc
Custom.
Happy Thought-Will go to Paris with, Wigthorpe. Will write
and tell my wife. Better not take her until I’ve been once or twice
myself, and know the place. A literary man (engaged on such a work
as Typical Developments) must go about, and see varieties of life. It’s
business, not pleasure. My wife and her mother-in-law (very poorly-
read person, MRs. Sympe Rson) are inclined to call it pleasure. They
never can understand what I mean.
WIGTHORPE appears to be known here. He says, “Garçon /*
boldly to the waiter, who returns, “Bienn'sieu !” and whisks imaginary;
crumbs off a table with his napkin. WIGTHoRPE reads several French
names to me from the bill of fare, and asks me what I’d like. I say
I’ll leave it to him. “Then,” he says, “I’ll give you a regular
French dinner, just what you º get at the Diner de Paris.”
Happy Thought.—Capital preparation for going to Paris. Come and
§ º often, and speak nothing but French to the waiter. Mem.
o do it.
I wish they wouldn't allow smoking while I’m dining. That’s the
worst of foreigners; all in the same room and at different stages of
dinner. The room is full of foreigners—Frenchmen, I suppose—and
two or three have evidently brought their wives or daughters. They
all seem to know one another, and talk across the tables and to the
Woman at the Counter.
Happy Thought—Good name for a novel, The Woman at the Counter.
Mem. in note-book.
The proprietor is a stout Frenchman, who plays with a dog and a cat,
and patronises the establishment in his shirt-sleeves, which are very
white; in fact he is so round, and white, and so white all-round, that
his face comes out at the top like a brown Fº As this is a
º happy simile (I am better, I think, at similes than I used to
be), I tell it to WIGTHORPE, who begs me to “hush,” as the proprietor
understands English, and hates to be called a plum-pudding. WIG-
THORPE tells me that most of the foreigners dining here are émigrés,
who are perpetually plotting something or other. He says that they
all stick together like wax. I should say they do, as they all look very
| letter from MR.
hot. [Note this down for Vol. II. of Typical Deve£: “On
Emigrés.”] I notice that all these distinguished Royalists put their
knives in their mouths, recklessly. ...WIGTHORPE asks, “Why not?”
When I tell him that I don’t think it’s good-breeding, he retorts that
I’m narrow-minded. -
Some of them have little bits of red riband in their button-holes, and
others parti-coloured rosettes about the size of a fourpenny piece.
WIGTHORPE whispers to me that there are lots of secret police always
about here. I say, “Indeed!” and can’t help looking about to find
out a Secret Policeman.
First Dish. Mussels in butter. I think I’d rather not. WIGTHORPE
says, “Absurd | You don't know how good they are.” He adds, that
it is the dish here. After tasting them, I am sorry to hear, it is the
dish, as I confess I don’t like them. Wigmoºre replies, “Perhaps
you don’t at first—it's an acquired taste.” I eat as many as I can, to
#. to WIGTHORPE that I am not a mere JoHN BULL, and preju-
iced, but I can’t get beyond half-a-dozen, and those with suspicion.
We then have some fish and oil, or rather Oil and fish. ...WIGTHOREE
is in raptures. He says it’s th best French dinner in London. He
pours out a bumper of red wine. I do the same. ...I suggest to Wig-
THQRPE that perhaps it’s a little thin and acid. He won't hear of it,
and, replies, indignantly, “Acid l. Not a bit! Hang it, it’s the wine
of the country.” He speaks as if we were in France—not within five
minutes of Leicester Square. I want some bread, and call out,
“Waiter!”, WIGTHORPE is disgusted. He likes to keep up the illu-
sion about being in Paris. . He says, “Garçon / du pain /* and puts
himself on a par with the émigrés and the secret police.
I can’t get a spoon for the salt, or the pepper...WIGTHQRPE laughs.
“They never do use spoons for salt and º he says, helping him-
self with the point of his knife. After the fish we have radishes, sar:
dines, and butter. I ask him if we’ve finished dinner, as I’m still
hungry. The waiter brings some filets de bouf au cresson, WIGTHORPE
is in ecstasies. There is barely enough for one to be divided by two.
WIGTHQRPE is astonished at my appetite. The next thing is the leg
of a chicken in a lot of olives. This is also for two. Then there is
cheese, then coffee and a cigarette. “For goodness' sake,” cries
WIGTHORPE, “don’t take milk with your café /* While here he talks
all his English in a subdued voice, and his French very loud. “There's
a dinner, Sir,” says, he “better than you can get at any Club in
London; and only two-and-sixpence, altogether. Two-and-sixpence
eachi Ver cheap! And threepence for garçon—two-and-nine.” WIG-
ThoRPE feels in his yºkº, and confounds it, because he has no change.
“I have ; what for?” “Ab,” he says, “you can’t manage a cheque,
can you, for twenty?” “No, I can't.” “Then,” says he, pleasantly,
“you square the dinner, and fºil settle with you afterwards.” I don’t
feel I’ve dimed, and say so. WIGTHORPE pretends to be perfectly
º an; satisfied. He adds, “Well, we can sup together some-
Where.
Happy Thought.—To say I should like it, but am engaged to WILLIs:
WIGTHORPE * good-bye, and hopes I ºil"come and look him up.”
in town. I will; and then he can settle with me for the dinner.
Back to WILLis's, in Conduit Street. Maid opens door..."Qh, are
ou the gentleman, Sir, who's going to sleep here to-night?” I reply
i. I am. “Ah, then,” says the maid, “here’s MR. RAwLINson’s
teh-key.” MR. RAWLINson is, it appears, the sharer of WILLIS's
sitting-room. I ask if he won't want it himself? Maid replies that he
left it out a p se, as he was gone to bed early, and he'd just had a
ILLIS in the country, who wasn't coming up to town,
but had given his bedroom, to a friend for the night. Good fellow
WILLIS. Wonder how he knew I was coming? Or did the maid
mean that he had given permission to MR. RAwlinson to let a friend
have it? Maid says she dare say that was it; only, as MR. WILLIs
hadn’t sent up his own latch-key, MR. RAWLINson had lent his in case
I wanted to stay out late.
Happy Thought. —Go somewhere.
Pharmacy Unusual.
According to the report of a case of poisoning in Lancashire, caused
by taking a powder instead of a pill:—
“The powder was intended for a wash, and not to be taken inwardly.”
Mahometan pilgrims in the desert are allowed to perform their pre-
scribed ablutions, in default of water, virtually with sand; but the
owder that was intended for a wash, one would think, could have
§. prescribed nowhere out of old Ireland.
New Fabric.
At the State Ball at Buckingham Palace on the 17th, we are told
that the PRINCEss Louis E wore a dress of “straw-coloured pont de
soie.” Rather a remarkable sight, to see a young lady in a ball-room
dressed in a “ º: of silk | " (Wiscountess PUNCH's Court Milliner

THE OLD STATE SWEEP.
WHAT a different people we are, Mr. Punch, from every other! When I say we, I mean
“the great Anglo-Saxon race.” What nations on earth, besides England and the United States,
are there in, which you see a party agitating for liquor laws to prevent their fellow-citizens from
getting drunk?. “Mind your own business” was our forefathers' maxim; our platform tells you
to mind your neighbour's.
. How is it that we, Britons get frightfully demoralised by things which do foreign popula-
tions no harm * In this country lotteries had to be abolished because they occasioned so much
crime. We hear nothing of any bad effect produced by them in Austria, or the Roman States,
where they are sanctioned by the Pope; and to say that his Holiness could possibly even
tolerate anything immoral would be to offer a gratuitous insult to the religion of a large body
of our fellow-subjects.
Lotteries, too, are among those matters that
they manage in France well enough, but we
can’t anyhow manage in England. he Post's
Paris Correspondent said lately:-
“The great lottery prize Wille loan, as might
be expected, was this week covered no one knows
how many times, and the obligations are at a
premium of 30 fr. A lottery in France will
always succeed.”
Why shouldn't it succeed equally well in
England without causing embezzlement, rob-
bery of tills, and suicide? For aught you
know, we have become more moral t We
were; perhaps our clerks and apprentices
could now resist temptation to which those
of a *. period succumbed, perhaps unsuc-
cessful speculators would be content to live,
and speculate another day. Just think, Mr.
Punch, if the Legislature could, consistently
with the public welfare, stand lotteries, how
many poor fellows it would make compara-
tively º: These fellows are at present
living, and have lived all their lives, in a state
of discontent and despair; discontent because
their circumstances are unequal to their
wants, despair because they have no chance,
º any exertion or other means whatsoever,
of making the fortune, which would appease
their longings. Now they might nevertheless-
be enabled, by |. in resolute parsi-
mony, to buy a lottery-ticket annually, making
their minds up to lose, mentally writing of its
price. There would be still, however, always
in view for them, the bare possibility of
winning a great prize; they would have at
least an infinitesimal spark of hope to comfort
them. Having any the smallest degree of
hope to live in is beatitude compared with
having no hope in life, the present case of
these thoughtful and cheerless fellows, who
see no luck, or probability of good between
themselves and the cemetery.
You, of course, Mr. Punch, will tell those
fellows that they must look beyond the ceme-
tery. Ay, reverend Sir. You will instruct
them that lotteries are pernicious for the
British Public, however wholesome for the
Roman, and are inadmissible in England,
even although they would divert much of
the gambling practised by Diddlers in joint-
stock shares at the public cost, insomuch,
Fº as to rid the nation of the Income-
ax by getting its equivalent in taxation out
of the gamblers. You will say that the only
lottery of which you can approve is matri-
mony. Very good, Sir; but that is a lot-
tery in which, if you draw a blank one year,
you can't, except by special fortune, try for
a prize the next, may never have another
chance of trying, and, should you, might per-
haps think you would be a fool to take it.
Your taking it would, as Johnson said, be
“the triumph of hope over experience”; a
triumph which hope, I fancy, seldom gains
more than once in the case of a widower.
Whereas, in that of yearly loss and re-invest-
ment of stake in the monetary lottery, it
would be annual. “Hope, like a glimmerin
º: light—" you know the rest; and wi
tell me that * in the lottery would re-
semble not that, but an IGNIS FATUUs.
P.S. Perhaps the most conclusive objection
to Lotteries |. can be named just now, is
that they would tend to distract that attention
of the public mind which ought to be wholly
concentrated on the state of the odds and
book-making for the St. Leger.
A Question for Convocation.
As a complete example of what is meant
by the Church Militant, would it be correct
to instance the Chaplain-General?

Theatre to see, MR. Tom TAYLoR's new Play, Mary Warner, you will
commiserate the unhappy case—not of the author, for he is to be
congratulated on º: another dramatic victory; not of the per-
formers, for º ave good parts to play, and º them well, (the
little “ lady of the house,” Miss MARY Wm. eserves the applause
she wins); not of the audience, for they have wisely availed themselves
of one of too few opportunities of sharing the sorrow and joy of
George and Mary Warner; but, as you look round at the well-peopled
house, and find from your bill that you are watching with an interest
which accumulates act by act, a Drama that can only be played for a few
nights—of the Manager, for whose sake you ... wish that Mary
arner's career in England, could be as long as it bids fair to be
prosperous. -
If you have already seen Miss BATEMAN–for whom this Drama was
expressly written—you will be glad to store up another recollection of
her pathetic ...; and power of moving many hearts to tears; if you
listen to her now for the first time, you will not fail to understand all
you have heard of her triumph as Leah, you will not fail to regret that
you are present at one of the nights of “a farewell engagement,” and
that a too brief acquaintance with so much power and tenderness
cannot be prolonged. - - --- - -
It would be unjust to close this notice, without a mention of MR.
Howe's excellent personation of George Warner, and it would be an un-
pardonable, omission not to add that Friday the 9th of July, will be
the last night on the English Stage of Mary Warner.

they will see how Genius can be neglected, and Industry go unrewarded.

selves, and the Royals, ought to be pleased also that next year's
ºś. will insist, as a matter of fairness to their brother
artists, that more time be allowed them for the consideration of works
sent for approval, and so hang and not gibbet such meritorious pro-
ductions as are to be found amongst others on the walls of the Supple-
mentary Exhibition.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OPERA of “OMELETTE.”
(With every apology to M. AMBRoſsE THOMAs.)
DEAR PUNCH,
HAve you seen the new French opera—I mean, burlesque of
Hamlet? I have not yet, myself, my reverence, for SHAKSPEAR::
hinders me. Fancy a Singing Hamlet, with “To be or not to be.”
turned into recitative, and emphasised at intervals with, thumps of the
# drum and thrums of the big fiddles! Still, everybody tells me that
I lose a treat by absence. I hear the words are quite delicious, and the
music is delightful—but any music must be so, when sweet-toned
NILsson sings it. I also hear that SANTLEY makes a splendid Hamlet,
or Omelette, let us rather say: for in French, you know, the H is
dropped in nearly everything but, Lobster, and omelette is a word
familiar to a Frenchman. They tell me, too, he sings, a famous drink;
ing song, does this melodious Omelette. A capital idea, in truth, and
worthy of the character of course the lines–
“As thou art a man,
Give me the cup; let go: by heaven, I'll have it.”
Show that Hamlet loved his cups, and was a jolly sort of fellow. A
drinking song is therefore just what SHAksPEARE would himself have
put into Hamlet’s mouth—that is, at least, if SHAKSPEARE, like his
eminent translator, had been writing a burlesque, and then, perhaps, he
might have written some such nonsense as the following, to the tune
of “Bobbing Joan,” or something equally appropriate:–
To drink, or not to drink?
That is now the question :
A glass of wine, I think,
s good for the digestion.
So come, my old friend Pol-
onius, do as I do;
Sing tolderol de rol,
And likewise tolderidol
Chorus—So come, my Pretty Pol., &c.
Or perhaps the British public would be better pleased just now with
a more modern drinking ditty, such as–
Recit. Champagne Hamlet is my name!
Chaº Hamlet is my name!
p to any sort of game, my boys,
Champagne Hamlet is my name, my boys!
And the matter I won't mince,
Of good fellows, I’m the Prince.

So I'm one of the Upper Ten Thou-sand!
Chorus (fortissimo). Yes, the matter we won’t mince,
Of Denmark he’s the Prince [Pause, with variations.
So he’s one of the Upper Ten Thou-sand!
Aria, with banjo obbligato—
If you ask me what I am,
Well, without a bit of flam,
I’m a Ham-let, I’m a Ham,
I’m a regular rollicking Ham!
Chorus Stentorissimo— . .

“MAGNA EST VERITAS, ET WAPULABIT.”
MR. GoLDwDN SMITH has got into hot water in his American Pro-
fessorship by speaking his mind about England and the United States,
MR. SUMNER, and the Alabama case. He has found out, like many
other too candid utterers of their thought, that among the wells better
let alone in the States, is the well with Truth at the bottom, when its
waters happen to be bitter to the Yankee palate. The papers sneer at
him as having been tempted across the Atlantic by a “fat Professor:
ship.” He might retort that he left a fatter; and that for one place of
honour or profit open to him in New England, ten were at his command
in Old. The last thing those who know Goldwin SMITH are likely to
charge him with is a desire to win gold.
The Wrong of Petition. -
WE are º: to state that the Petitions referred to, in a para-
graph in our last week's Number were signed at 13, “Took's." Court,
and not at 13, “Cook’s” Court, as we had it. We are now right to a T.
“BY THE RIGHT-DRESS "
“The Soldier's Tear” has long been popular. The Soldier’s “Wear
and Tear” has at last, and not too soon, attracted attention. Tunics
that check movement, impede respiration, absorb perspiration, and
wear out quickly, are about to be replaced by blouse-like “Norfolk.”
coats, loose round, the chest, and drawn in at the waist with a band.
There will be howling from Čolone. Firectºr, and gmashing of teeth
from MAJOR MARTINET, over the innovation. It is the beginning of
the end. Stocks will follow tight tunics. Men will be able to breathe
and run and jump, without rupturing their aortas or bursting their but-
tons; recruits will no longer be properly “setup,” or meddlesome arm
reformers properly set down: in short, the Service will go to the devil.
CoLoREI. PIPECLAY will find half his work of inspection cut from under
him, and the worst part of MAJOR MARTINET’s vocation will be gone.
Nor is the audacious hand of innovation to stop at soldiers' funics.
Soldiers' shirts are about to be reformed, by the use of a mixture of
woollen and cotton, which, like its wearers, is warranted not to shrink.
It is, besides, to be cheap, light, and soft—in a word, a model shirt:
and made, let us hope, not at the slop-shops, but by the hands of the
female prisoners of Brixton and Milbank, or by regularly and decently
paid workers in the Military Clothing Establishment.
Then the great-coat is to be lightened, and a waterproof cape added.
And then for a better packed and more Fº knapsack!
More power to MR. CARDwell’s elbow in these and all equally
sensible reforms! But when we haye done all that can be done in the
way of dressing our corps d’armée, don’t let us do with it what LoRD
CHESTERFIELD recommended his son to do with the salad after ºf
it—throw it away. Let the well-dressed soldier be well drilled, we
lodged, well amused, well employed, and well looked after while, in the
§º| and we will answer fºr his being well conducted when he
eaves lt.
“Reform your tailors' bills!” was a popular cry once. Let us hope
“Reform your Military BILLY TAYLoR’s bills!” is about to be as
popular a cry now ; and that this will not be the only Card-well
played by the present SecBETARY-AT-WAR.
“THE NOBLE GAME OF GOOSE WAS THERE IN WIEW.”
Goldsmith.
IN a recent police case the witnesses spoke of one “LoRD HAMILTON”
who had been scrambling away his money, at a low public in Shadwell,
with the suggestive sign of the “Paddy's Goose.” More than one
noble young British sportsman has been frequenting very questionable
publics lately for the same spirited pastime. But in these cases the
goose is rather the sign of the customer than the public, and the
nationality of the weakminded bird is not limited to one of the British
islands. We have had “Johnny's goose” and “Sawney's goose” in
the person of the DUKE of NewcASTLE and the Duke of HAMILTON;
for if ever what the Scotch call “dukes" were geese, it is in the case
of these two amazingly silly boys; and in both instances, we fear, the
ſº be said to have been cooked, done brown, and cut up, by
ls time.
WHO WOULD BE A PRINCE 2
“THE Royal Visit to HULL-An effort is being made to induce the
PRINCE and PRINcess of WALEs to extend their visit to Hull for a few
hours, but it appears probable, according to present arrangements, that their
Royal Highnesses will return to London the same evening.
ARE You surprised that their Royal Highnesses intend to make so
short a stay? what follows :-
“Addresses will be º at the station by the Town Council, by the
Dock Company, by the Chamber of Commerce, by the Consuls, and by the
Danish Residents."
(Why not also by the Custom House Officers, the Police,, the Fire
Brigade, and the Velocipedists?) Do you wonder now that the Prince
and Princess propose to “return to London the same evening”?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
. Monday, June 21st. Various notices of the ways in which the nobility
intend to improve the Irish Church Bill have been given, but sufficient
for the night is the dulness thereof, and Mr. Punch will not anticipate
the fray; He may mention, however, that EARL RUSSELL's dissatisfaç-
tion with the details manifests itself in a proposal that Church funds
shall be expended in building houses and buying glebe for Presbyterian
and Catholic clergymen. We suspect it will be some time before MR.
ADDIson’s hymn will be raised in the chapels of either class:—
“When in the sultry Glebe Ifaint.”
The Orangemen of Ireland threaten a grand demonstration on the
12th of July; and MR. CHICHESTER, FoRTEscue, questioned, stated
that he should send a particularly strong force of soldiers and con-
stables, to prevent disturbance by these fiery Protestants.
On two nights this week the Commons addressed themselves to the
composition of the Compound Householder, and he was duly recon-
structed, and is totus teres atque rotundus, MR. VERNoN HARCOURT
made an attempt to get the vote for him whether his landlord paid up
or defaultered, but GLADSTONE held that we had to do with a
detail and not with a new political reform. , MR. HARCOURT, bravel
persisting, 291 against 42 marked the House's sense of his forty-two’d.
(A goak.)
1. Nineteen Abyssinians were selected for the Committee.
Tuesday. Some fun in the Lords. The Strangers demonstrated so
boldly at the ends of the Conservative speeches on the I. C. B., that
LoRD RomILLY and others were scandalised, and there was reference
to the French Revolution and the Mountain. But LoRD GRANVILLE,
who would smile a roaring lion into affability, said that he did not
expect any horrors, and deprecated legislation on account of the
exceptional conduct of some excited Irishmen. EARL BEAUCHAMP
(who wedded LoRD MACAULAY's Valentine”) complained that ladies
of title who had no right in the galleries were admitted to the exclusion
of Peeresses. But what can officials do when beautiful women, in all
their loveliness of arrogance, look them down and walk where they will?
Yet, if the officials of the House of Lords cannot do their duty, º
§ abstain from impertinence. LoRD BEAUCHAMP had to
“Order,” and found that the persons who were violating it were three
servants of the House, jabbering.
Bankruptcy in the Commons-likewise Local Taxation, Pauperism,
Sunday Liquor, Sunday-School Taxation, and cognate topics of butter-
fly discourse.
To-day the WICERoy of EGYPT came, and is understood to be by no
means delighted with his reception. What a Rum thing it is, that
whereas º: individually, are as stingy as the Juice, their State
hospitalities always are splendid and graceful, whereas an Englishman,
who, individually, gives a guest the best that he can, and as much of it
as he can, lets the powers that be manage to make Éurope think that a
visitor to England is scurvily treated. However, amends were offered
to the ViceRoy at the State Concert, which was composed of the most
pious music set to words of Christian devotion, but into which was
inserted, in order to cause the Mahommedan to feel quite at home, an
air from the Seraglio.

Say, on the northern Strand,
Or shall Boblo

We beg pardon for, this burst of poesy, but have had to ask the
question in prose until we felt unequal to doing so again. Government
also feels unequal to answer the question, which is again referred to a
Select Committee. “ º Temple Bar, are ye standing yet, And are
your sides a shaking yet?” You may laugh, old one, but the masons
are #. who shall come against you with pickaxes, yea, and with
Crowbars.
Wednesday. Somebody wants to abolish the Irish £1 note. But it is
clear that the peasantry like the article, and would not rather have a
guinea than a one pound note, for a shilling is charged for changing a
gold coin in the Green Isle. Moreover, they like to hoard, and it is
easy to hide away a note where feminine piety can't hunt it up for the
priest in the husband's absence. The abolition is not to be.
Among the scoundrelisms of trade is the Adulteration of Seeds—
those the farmer sows. Not only do seed-dealers sell worse sorts than
those they profess to vend, but they will “kill” seed in tons to pre-
vent the discovery of their iniquities, or to raise prices. The question
of seed-murder is to be sent to a Select Committee—Punch would
like to send a perpetrator before such a Committee, to consist of
twelve, with power to subtract from the number of rascals in existence.
Thursday. MARQUIs Townshend again proposed a yariety of legis-
lations in the interest of humanity and social comfort, and with, the
usual result. Among them was a clause forbidding the cruelty which
covers, a long street or road with large tº: over which
miserable horses struggle, heart-broken, and gallant horses plunge and
cut their hoofs and legs to pieces. A roller (used in one or two dis-
tricts inhabited by Christians) would save all this suffering, and im-
prove the roadway into the bargain, but the greedy contractor will not
º, one, and the Porochials are much too busy with their muddling
squabbles and jobbery to think of the horses.
. The Bishop of Oxford caused the insertion of a very good clause
in the Beer Houses Bill. The keepers of these dens are not content
with the mischief done “on the premises,” but often take adjoining
houses, where disorder is encouraged. The Bishop's clause will §:
a fellow who does this from having any licence at all... His Lordship is
to be thanked. Apropos of nothing, who will tell Mr. Punch the
meaning of the arms of a Bishop of Oxford * The upper part of the
shield (ride DEBRETT) presents us with “three demi-ladies, couped,”
and looking down, as from a private box, on the Ox crossing the Ford.
Who were these members of the demi-monde? Dear and learned MR.
PLANCHE, to you we speak, º who know everything except how to
be uncourteous. (Not a goak.)
Commons, perfectly dull, except, that, MR. FAwcETT made fight
against portions of the Pensions Bill, and did induce the Government
to improve it, if you call it improving a Bill to enact that a person shall
have done something to deserve a pension before he gets it...The idea
of working for anything is too shocking to Mr. Punch for him to con-
tinue the discussion, but those who are fanatic, and believe in labour,
may be pleased with MR. FAwcETT. We concede his good intent.
ouching Greenwich Hospital, MR. CHILDERs made the following
lucid and elegant statement: “Government did not propose to apply
Greenwich Hospital to any purpose which they might afterwards regret
having applied it to, º, for the sake of using it.” The FIRST Lord
been among his sailors lately, and might have heard of a better
Evasive Answer than that. -
The House of Commons, at the instigation of his Grace the ARCH-
Bishop of York, then re-christened a place called Kirkthwaite, which
shall no more be called Kirkthwaite, but shall be called Cowgill. We
have not the least idea where the place is—the Bill is called the Park
Gate Chapel Bill. The Cowgillers don't like the change, but of course
the House was not going to listen to them. Still, we remark that the
new name is hideous, and that cows have no gills, except in the case of
the Cow-Fish of Madagascar (Orthroporiscus vaccinatus) in the South
Kensington Museum. This place, by the way, being one of the few
good things in London, is not being completed, Lowe having
no funds for such an object.
Friday. LoRD REDEsdale signified that he should not allow the
Irish Bishops to be turned out of the House of Lords. ... If Mr. Punch
were quite sure that there would be a perpetual apostolical succession
of them capable of saying the neatest of things at the F. of
moments, as one of the Irish prelates did last week, he might be inclined
to vote with Lord REDESDALE. He is informed that a Bishop of the
Irish Church trod upon the train of the amiable, lady who resides in
Lambeth Palace. Apologising, his Lordship added, “But is it wonder-
ful that we trembling prelates should § to the skirts of QANTER-
BURY P” Some dozen pretty things like that might imperil the Irish
Church Bill. - - -
The Imprisonment for Debt Bill passed through Committee in the
Commons. There is to be no imprisonment for debt; but if low people
don’t % their debts they are to go to prison for contempt of Court.
What Edie Ochiltree said hereon will occur to all but fools; that is, to
all who are well up in the Waverley Novels. -
MR. FAwcETT made an able, speech on the necessity of compulsory
education for agricultural children, and, complimenting the Conserva-
tives on their having, twenty years ago, forced such a system on the
Manufacturing interest, asked them not to wonder that they, in §
were invited to adopt what had worked so well. MR. BRUCE admitte
the importance of the subject, an admission, that a practised Minister
would begin to make if suddenly waked up in the middle of the night.
MR. HENLEY demanded religious education, which he thought the
people desired, and MR. ScourFIELD said that a man ought not to be
called ignorant if he could do the duty he had to do. Something like
Summer being reported, it occurred to Mr. Punch that he should
displa ignºrance if he did not adjourn for a cool potation. Potaturus
vos salutat .
Quite Right.
WILLIAM TITE receives knighthood. It is not much of an honour,
but WREN got no more, at least from Royalty. . But as it is meant for
an honour, Mr. Punch is glad, for MR.TITE is a worthy gentleman
and an eminent architect. Which of the Orders of Architecture is it
to be? Surely that of the Royal Exchange.
