“WILL
TILL S. S. do me the honour of being as comfortable as possible ?" said MR. PUNCH, respectfully. “Can S. S.
be more so ?"
“ Non possumus," said the POPE, smiling. “ And as for this cigar, I could fancy it came from my box of favourites."
“ Your Holiness wished for that cigar, and it is here," said Mr. Punch, improving on GEORGE Douglas's pretty
speech to QUEEN MARY. " ANTONELLI took care of that for me. He is a clever man, that ANTONELLI, Your Holiness."
Worldly, my dear MR. Puncı. But I may say of you what was said in certain remarkable Latin you wot of:
“ Dixit Abbas ad Prioris-
Tu es homo boni moris,
Quia semper sanioris
Mihi das consilia."

“ My humble counsel is ever at S. S.'s service.”
"Say advice, will you,” replied the POPE. "The other word reminds me of the Ecumenical, the greatest bore of
my life."
"Tu l'as voulu '-I beg Your Holiness a million pardons. I mean that the Council is not exactly a fortuitous
concourse of atoms."
“ Mea culpa, mea magna culpa," replied the Pope, laughing. “But how was I to know that JESHURON would
wax fat and kick ? "
“ Is it to me that S. S. confesses that he is not Infallible ?"
“ One to you," said the POPE, "and make the most of it. I thought I was going to create a Punctum Temporis,
you know."
“And non omne tulit punctum S. S.,” said MR. PUNCH, bowing. "In fact Your Holiness's pointsmen appear
addicted to shunting. But better so than collision."
“There has no business to be any collision," said the Pope. "That Emperor of yours behaves, as they elegantly
say of a crime in Japan, in the manner which is not expected. You may translate that-silently, however."
“I never curse, Your Holiness. But might I suggest—"
Might you ? Am I not here to consult you, knowing there is one person in the world who will tell me the
truth ? Pergere licet."
“ Then, Your Holiness, I would hint that considering what that Emperor-I beg to disclaim any proprietorship in

" Why, MONSIEUR Punch, you are always backing him up ? "
Only against a worse system, and in the hope that he will establish a better."
“ Not he. And he comes against me like Diabolus against Mansoul—0, I have read your Bunyan—"
“ Happily remembered, Your Holiness. Who concluded your last Holy War, and had your army more visibly led
by S. Chassepot than the Spaniards were led at Compostella by S. Iago ? "
“He only did his duty. Besides, he wanted an opportunity of showing off his new guns. That chance has
saved him a good deal of trouble since. I consider him a very ungrateful son of—of the Church. Why does he
interfere with my Dogma?"
“ I suppose, Your Holiness, that his conscience—(8. S. smiles)-prevents his assenting to the existence of an
Infallibility that does not recognise his own merits."
“ Worldly, my dear MR. PUNCH. He is spoiling my Council. What shall I do ?”
“I think I have read something, Your Holiness, about not disputing with the master of so many legions. I
do not like to mention a name of ill omen for the Temporal Power, but if NAPOLEON left Rome, GARIBALDI would
certainly arrive in time for supper—if not in time to eat the exquisite dinner Your Holiness's cook composes."
"I wish they were both supping in purgatory. Come, that is not a savage wish, considering all things,”
laughed the POPE.
"I compliment Your Holiness on a digestion that sees no particular terror in a hot supper,” replied MR. PUNCH.
“Of S. S.'s amiability there is no doubt. I think it will have to be displayed at this crisis, and that a disagreeable
situation will be gracefully accepted. Better this than slide on rotten ice, if I may recal a Cartoon."
“ You made me laugh," said the POPE, " though I was in no laughing mood.”
" When one's mood is not the Potential, Your Highness, a laugh is sometimes true wisdom. I reverentially
suggest a Smiling Policy to S. S. Let your Council deal in smooth things, and—S. S.'s hospitality is well known, but
the sooner Rome has a good view of the backs of most of those prelates, the better for her Church. There will have
been some grand religious spectacles, and we cannot have a Council of Trent every three hundred years."
“I fear you too are worldly, my dear Mr. Punch,” replied the POPE. “ But I think you mean me well. You
ought-your ancestors were Italian, and though qui multùm peregrinatur rarò sanctificatur, your insular sojourn has not
altogether vitiated you. Come to Rome, and I will make you a lay Cardinal."
“ The stockings tempt me, Your Holiness, and my leg is neat," said Mr. Punch, fondly caressing the elegant limb
he named." But I have a prejudice in favour of cleanliness, and Rome may be the holiest, but is certainly the filthiest
city in the whole world. The stable of the King of Elis was tidy, comparatively."
“ Come and be my ALCIDES-Ædile?”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BRITISH LION SECURE.
MR. Punch will have seen that his friend, the MARQUIS
OF SALISBURY, discussing the question of “ Concurrent
Endowment,” adverted to the change, remarkable enough,
which has taken place in the mind of the British Public,
touching Roman Catholicism, since the time of the Papal
Aggression-a change, says the Times, “such that the
Ecclesiastical Titles Act is daily violated, although it is
still retained on the statute book.”
Yes; and Mr. Punch, will have noted that a change has
also taken place in the affairs of Europe. Since the time of
the Papal "Aggression, the Kingdom of Italy has been
created-in a great measure by the help of Mr. Punch-
Constitutional Government, has, with the same assistance,
been established in Austria. ISABELLA THE SECOND,
through not attending to Mr. Punch, has been obliged
to fly her queendom with FATHER CLARET at her tail
,
and, owing much to Mr. Punch, religious liberty triumphs
in Spain. All these changes have been made in perfect
accordance with the advice of Mfr. Punch, and entire
opposition to the preachments of the Roman Catholic
Clergy and the fulminations of the Pope, and his Syllabus.
The British Public accordingly thinks it has now no longer
any reason to be afraid of Popery. It has not, and had
not when it rebuffed Papal Aggression, any objection to
Roman Catholicism as a mere religion-for those who
belong to it, or choose it. The Ecclesiastical Titles Act
has done its work. Perhaps, Mr. Punch will possibly sub-
join. Nobody ever wanted it enforced. Almost everybody
would willingly see it repealed-provided they first saw
the French garrison finally withdrawn from Rome. Eh,
Mr. Punch?
In the meanwhile it will perhaps be Mr. Punch's opinion
that if ARCHBISHOP MANNING would have his order, and
their flocks, show gratitude to those who have been their
best friends, and greatest benefactors, he should exhort
them to subscribe handsomely for the presentation of
testimonials to VICTOR-EMMANUEL, GARIBALDI, and Von
h
Brust. So at least Mr. Punch will think if the honour of
thinking with Mr. Punch has been vouchsafed to his humble
servant the unsleeping

When first I tuk the notion,
That parties didn't as they used,
Take reglar to the ocean.
The hinfants, darling little soles,
Still cum quite frequent, bless 'em !
But they is only sixpence each;
Wbich hardly pays to dress 'em.
The reason struck me all at once,
Says I, “It's my opinion,
The grown-up folks no longer bathes
Because of them vile Sheenions."
The last as cum drest in that style,
Says, as she tuk it horf her,
“I'm sure I shall not know the way
To re-arrange my quoffur !”
By which she ment the ed of air,
Which call it wot they will, Sir;
Cum doubtless off a convict at

Which there's sufficient reason;
That folks as wear the Sheenions should

PARLIAMENTARY SHOOTING SAVED.
The Lords against the Commons shot
At Wimbledon, and lost the game
This time; the Irish Church Bill got
Off, in contesting, much the same.
But as to shooting, oh, how near
To having none was either House !
Prolonged debate might have, both Peer,
And Commoner, withheld from Grouse.
Or, if dismissed awhile, to chase
Their feathered prey on mount and moor,
They might have been condemned to face
An Autumn Session's awful bore,
Constrained to work when they would play,
The partridge o'er the plains pursue,
Or, stationary, pheasants slay,
Or slaughter hares in a battue.
But noble Lords have saved their own,
And honourable Members' sport,
And, when a few days shall have flown,
The Parliamentary Report
Will be but the repeated pop
Of their breech-loaders on the Hills,
Both Houses having shut up shop,
Whilst birds alone bring forward bills.

VI.-LINES BY RAIL.
Off with a friend to Brighton,
I went in the Express;
My heart was light,
My hat was white,
I wore a summer dress.
I went to meet my fair one
Upon the Brighton Pier.
Ah, now I do not care one
Dump-but you shall hear.
For mate from mate
To
separate
Does seem to me a pity;
Yet I came from Victoria,
My friend came from the City.
And when I say my friend, I mean
A friend who was at school with me :
And who since then,
Now we are men,
Has often played the fool with me.
I was alone, and thought of Her,
Who was no flirt or hoyden;
The City train, I'll here explain,
Joins t'other one at Croydon.
Perhaps I'm wrong in this detail,
I'd had one gin-and-seltzer,
With ice, and so
The change, you know,
Might have been somewhere else, Sir.
At all events my friend and I,
In this fine summer weather,
Were far apart, that is at start,
But somewhere came together.
So came together that we winked,
But couldn't talk, a bother;
We sat in carriages distinct,
And far from one another.
He was so far from me he might
Have been among the Feejees ;
But let that pass,
Necessitas
Non habet any leges.
I thought of her, I dreamt of her,
My own, my darling LAURA;
They woke me from a sleep, so deep,
Because I was a snorer.
I'd slept an hour, I do believe,
The snooze was not a light 'un;
And then we stopped, from what they droppedy
I gathered t'wasn't Brighton.
I muttered something 'twixt my teeth,
The mat beneath I stamped on.
Oh, rage ! despair! Where, tell me where
We are? Sir, Littlehampton."
My friend went on to Brighton,
He met my darling LAURA.
Said he, “Miss L.,
The truth to tell
'Tis 1 am your adorer !”
“Yes, your pretended lover has
With some one else decamped : on
My word I do,
Declare 'tis true-
He's gone to Littlehampton.”
The pair they laughed,
I telegraphed
But p'raps you've heard before of it ?
If so, tho' true,
This isn't new,
And you shall bear no more of it.
But for this fickle friend of mine,
Who thinks himself
a Crichton,
Whom I'll—no, not another line,
About my trip to Brighton.

“BLOW FLY FISHING.”
THIS IS HOW OLD PUFFINS (WITH THE AID OF A Blow-TOBE) GETS OVER THE
EXERTION OF THROWING A FLY.
SPADE AND SAW 0. RIFLE AND BAYONET.
THE sorely-tried Military Authorities who have to decide on inventions, have
had laid before them a light steel spade, which screws into the butt of the rifle, as
the saw-backed sword-bayonet into its muzzle. When an old-fashioned soldier
used the butt of piece as a weapon, he used to be said to “club his musket."
Henceforth, it seems, spades will be added to clubs, to help the points of the mili-
tary game. But now that "spade-drills" and "earthworks” are to be among the
chief reliances of the soldier of the future, the art of war seems really to be changing
into husbandry.. "Turning rifles into spades, and bayonets into saws,” is quite as
apt a symbol of the change, as “beating spears into shares, and swords into
sickles.”
Playing at Priests.
MR. Punch observed a paragraph headed as above, and of course passed it
over, having had enough of Ritualism. But, seeing it again (paragraphs you want
to neglect always crop up, somehow) be found that three small boys got into a
chapel, lit candles, and were enacting priests. Surely Ritualism will feel sym-
pathy enough for fellow offenders to pay their fines.

Meeting for the third time, I don't know what to do.
Happy Thought.-Safest thing to smile and take off my hat. Miss
MILLAR acknowledges it gravely. Pity people can't be hearty. She
might have twinkled up and nodded.
DILBURY points out a picture to me. A large one. "Yours?” I ask.
Happy Thought.-
To make sure of this before I say anything about
it. He nods yes, and looks about to see whether any one is listening.
I suppose he expects that if it got about that he was here he'd be
seized and carried in procession round the galleries on the shoulders of
exulting multitudes. However, there is no one near the picture
("which” he complains"is very badly hung”) and consequently no
demonstration.
“Good subject, eh?” he asks me. "Yes, very,” I answer, wishing
I'd asked him first what it was, or had referred to the Catalogue. It
is classical, evidently; that is, judging from the costume, what there is
of it. I try to find out quietly in the Catalogue.
DILBURY says, “ You see what it is of course ?" Well-I-I-I in
fact, don't, that is, not quite.
"Well," he replies, in a tone implying that I am sure to recognise
it when I hear it, "it's Prometheus Instituting the Lampadephoria. To
which I say, "Oh, yes, of course. Prometheus vinctus," and look at the
number to see how he spells it. I compliment him. Very fine effect
of light and shade. In fact, it's all light and shade, representing a lot
of Corinthians (he says it's in Corinth) running about with red
torches. DILBURY points out to me the beauties of the picture. He
says it wants a week's study. He informs me that it was taken on the
spot, and that his models were “ the genuine thing."
Happy Thought.—To say, “I could stop and look at this for an age,”
then take out my watch.
"You can come back again to it," observes DILBURY, seizing my
elbow again.

My respected friend, JEREMY DIDDLER,
Esq, once gave a very admirable pendant
to the well known title of a medical work,
"What to Eat, Drink, and Avoid."
Thus-What to Eat: everything in season.
What to Drink : the best wines in the house.
Wbat to Avoid : the waiter. This sounds
well in theory, but for its successful practice
there are required quicker eyes and more
nimble legs than fall to the lot of most of
us-or rather, the few of most of us. Every
one has heard the story of “two brandy-
and-waters getting over the palings,". pale
brandies they must have been--but the inevi.
table attendant caught them up be sure.
They were brandies and waiters in the end,
no doubt.
I rejoice to come across a middle-aged man
who likes tarts. There are few pleasanter
sights than a Scotch confectioner's, with its
crowd of full-grown and often elderly cus-
tomers. A man who retains his sweet tooth
after forty is seldom a bad fellow. To see
the blasé lads of two-and-twenty shake their
beads and growl “dyspepsia,” when the
pastry enters, and then watch them cry bavoc
with the cheese, and rush wildly at the
radishes, is to me far from pleasant. Wby,
too, is the good old word “Pie” becoming
obsolete-I mean in its fruity sense ? Some-
body told me the other day it was vulgar to
give people custards. My informant smo-
thered her aspirates, and called regiment

The lessee of an al fresco place of amuse-
ment, (finding the wet weather usually set in

After all, a man's best friends and his worst

He was a foolish fellow and inclined to go

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A CURE FOR RAILWAY CRUELTY.
CORRESPONDENTS are continually complaining of the
want of punctuality on railways, and phrasing forth their
fears lest accidents should thereby happen, and themselves
be smashed. But want of common sense in nine cases
out of ten is the real cause of accidents, and until Directors
generally have learned to grasp this fact, there is very
little hope of accidents decreasing. For the sake of false
economy, it is the fashion to cut down the cost of needful
care and caution, and to employ one guard or signalman
to do the work of six. This arrangement may, by luck,
suffice for ordinary traffic: but when excursion trains are
added, as they are now in autumn-time, to those of every
day, human flesh and blood grow weary with long hours of
extra work, and drowsiness (some call it negligence) arises,
and then accidents ensue. Directors weigh humanely the
chance of paying damages against the certainty of incur-
ring some additional expense in the safe working of their
line. Perhaps they might be taught to show more mercy
to their passengers if some such an Act of Parliament were
passed as we subjoin :-
Whereas, human flesh and blood are not valued upon
railways so highly as they should be, and this is one of
the chief reasons why accidents occur :
Be it enacted therefore that no signalman, or guard, or
any other servant, shall work on any railway more than
eight hours in the twenty-four, which constitute a day.
Be it enacted further that, with the view to the encou-
ragement of proper care and caution, Directors shall be
personally liable for damages, to be assessed according to
the Schedule here annexed :-

developing my plan of note-books.
To WILLIS's rooms. Rush up to tell RAWLINSON everything about
it. He's not there. Pass the evening in dining out, and coming
in five times to see if RAWLINSON has returned yet. At last he
appears.
Sit up with RAWLINSON and MILBURD chatting. When RAWLINSON
doesn't go to bed early he is an excellent hand at sitting up and
chatting. He sits up (when he does sit up) till three or four in the
morning "expecting,” he says, " that it's not unlikely some fellow
will drop in.” I never yet have seen any fellow drop in at that time;
so I fancy it's an excuse that RAWLINSON makes to himself, so that

We naturally discuss POPGOOD AND GROOLLY.
I ask him whether he thinks they'll read it. RAWLINSON says, “Oh
of course,” heartily. RAWLINSON always commences with the brightest
view possible under any circumstances, and then gradually introduces,

their man will. Publishers keep a man, you know," (I don't know,
but I nod as if POPGOOD's man was a matter of course), “who has
to read everything and advise upon it."
I observe, “I suppose he'll advise on Typical Developments."
Happy Thought.-P'raps he's reading it now, and enjoying it.
I say this. MILBURD says, “ P'raps he isn't,” which he thinks
funny, and I think simply stupid. Rawlinson doesn't laugh. He
sympathises with me in a literary matter, I know.
“I suppose," addressing myself to RAWLINSON, "they won't be
long before they give me an opinion?'
Oh, no time!” replies Rawlinson, heartily.
Quicker, if possible,” says MILBURD. (That's the worst of him :
he never knows when to stop: For myself, I enjoy a joke as much as
anybody; but this is out of place now.)
Happy Thought.—Not even smile. Take no notice of him.

occurrence on the London and South Western line. One thinks
that they would be of frequent occurrence if the authorities of that
line were accustomed to put signalmen on duty for between
thirteen and fourteen hours at a stretch. So probably they are
not so culpable as “it was stated” they were. Otherwise it
would be to be regretted that the Magistrates who gave their

not exercise, the power of giving them, Directors and all, im-
prisonment without option.

To be encountered in the West of Town,
When clubs are cleaned, and parks are slightly brown,
And all the gay and glittering throng have fled.

In terror, lest the car should hurl me down,
Or stucco me with mire from heel to crown;
In shops I'm promptly served; in taverns fed
With welcome haste; the papers I peruse.

Without delays, in comfort watch each act
Unfold the plot, at ease applaud the views-

A WOMAN'S OWN CHARITY.
An appeal has been made to the Public by a benevolent lady on
behalf of an Institution of ambiguous
name. It is entitled St. Luke's
Home for Incurable Women. Certainly some women are incurably fond
of finery and furniture; of gadding about, dancing, tale-bearing, and
scandal. Some are incurable flirts; many incurable chatterboxes. Not
a few are incurably jealous, or incurably perverse, or incurably extra-
vagant, or bave incurable tempers. In a general way, it may be said
that incurable women are women whom it is impossible to care of
their whims.
In some respects the majority of women may appear incurable ; but
their malady yields to time, and they are cured at last. Almost all of
them were for many years afflicted with a frenzy for crinoline which
defied ridicule, and all other remedies, but the crinolinomania ultimately
ceased, though a relapse of it may occur yet. Perhaps girls will, one
of these days, be cured of the fixed idea represented by chignons.
Having said thus much of incurable and curable women, we may
observe that Miss L. TWINING has acknowledged the receipt of
£14 138. subscriptions in aid of her Home for the former, and says that
any further contributions will be thankfully received. What can't be
cured must be endured, but it may be palliated, and much suffering,
doubtless, will be prevented by the liberal support of the Charity
advocated by Miss TWINING.
Military Intelligence.
Many years ago the discovery was made that common soldiers were
not to be trusted off duty with their side-arms. It remained to be
found out by the authorities at Head Quarters that there was any
danger in trusting them with the possession of ball-cartridge.

(Respectfully Dedicated to the British Association.)
Hear a Gorilla, sprite-possessed,
A Medium-Ape, with tongue controlled
So that he shall, in speech expressed,
His ancient pedigree unfold;
It from Humanity began :
His line descends from Ancient Man.
“There was an Island of the Sea;
Now 'tis a part of Ocean’s bed,
There dwelt our primal ancestry.
Long ages since their day have fled.
They were a race, for brain and mind,
The chiefest of the human kind:
“Land of green wood and grassy mead,
And hedgerows bearing summer flowers,
Land of that once heroic breed
Whose last degenerate race bred ours.
Of whom a pair clung, when the Sea
Their isle whelmed, to a floating tree.
“ Land of cathedrals old and grey,
And castles of historic fame;
Progress improved them all 'away,
And field and forest served the same.
Material Progress did destroy
That Island's beauty and its joy.
"For Science into sordid hands
Put chemic and mechanic force,
And power to work their gross commands
Gave creatures covetous and coarse.
So all things were consumed too fast;
Whereby the nation's grandeur passed.
"New, mean, close-clustered houses crèpt
O'er all the commons and the downs.
For agriculture space was kept

A level dull and dead declined.
Of general cram there also grew
Low uniformity of mind.
Genius was starved; it could not move
And work in the gregarious groove.
"The glorious stage of other days
Was shared by Vice and Folly now;
Buffooneries and sensation plays :
Because the Drama had to bow
To idiots, and to snobs, of taste
For scenes of common life debased.
Imagination had no scope,
No field the higher powers of thought.
Justice, Faith, Charity, and Hope,
Conceited sneerers set at nought.
The crowns of people slowly sank :
Backward their foreheads sloped and shrank.
“Yet did our fathers not descend
To what I am but by degrees,
They, long ere apehood was their end,
Did, like each other as Chinese,
A nation by competitive
Examination flattened, live.

The jaw its last advance; the hair
Grew shag, eye-teeth turned fangs, and feet
Of climbing hands a hinder pair.

THE MILTONIC MARE'S NEST.
(An American Sensation Story.)
The truth about John Milton is out at last. We knew already, as a kindred
spirit said of him, that he was a harsh, sire, odd spouse." That was a fact, and
not to be denied." For the first MRS. MILTON left his house." Why did she
skedaddle ?
The later LORDS FAIRFAX were, for a considerable length of their pedigree,
citizens of the United States. The last LORD FAIRFAX died only the other day.
His celebrated ancestor once had an interview of five minutes with the first MRS.
Milton. In that she confided to him a thrilling secret. His ancestors kept it out
of respect to the fair fame of the Author of Paradise Lost. But, when their latest
descendant's papers were rummaged at his decease, it came out.
Milton is well known to have been a Dissenter from the Episcopal Church of
England. The reason of his dissent has always been taken for granted to have
been conscientious conviction. We now know what it was.
It is a fact which his biographers have unaccountably overlooked, that the
maternal parent of old MR. Milton, John's father, lived to a very advanced age.
She was the cause of John Milton's secession from the English Church. She was
also the cause of bis disagreement with his wife, which occasioned the first MRS.
Milton to absquotilate.
The Anglican table of the Prohibited Degrees of Affinity and Consanguinity
begins with the declaration that :-
“A man may not marry his Grandmother.”
But for that, MILTON would have remained an Episcopalian, and not have married
the woman he first did. He told her so immediately after their marriage, when they
were starting for their honeymoon, with a volley of oaths and curses. She was
jealous. He gave her cause.
The foregoing statement is genuinely reliable.
We guess nobody a cut above BRIGHAM YOUNG will ever read a line of Paradise
Lost again.

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.

Now what did SOAVE JENYNS observe to GEORGE D'ARCY?
Anyone knowing what SOAME JENYNs said will kindly forward
the same to the Editor of the Commencements, &c.
As an example of Endings : “There's a capital Irish story ending
with Bedad, Docther, 'tis the same thing entirely.' How does this
begin ?"
His nose,' answered the wit. ERSKINE smiled at the witticism,
but never forgave the satire." How
does this commence ?
I would give a trifle to remember one or two things I've said also,
but I dare say they'll come in in time. A friend of RAWLINSON's told me
10001
the other day about somebody on a tight-rope, and I made a reply
which set everyone roaring; there were only RAWLINSON, Cazell, and
self. I couldn't write it down at the time, and two hours after I
couldn't recall it.
I ask RAWLINSON; he doesn't remember. I ask Cazell, he doesn't.
CAZELL says he 'll think of it, and he's got a capital thing for me
for Typ. Dedel. Will he tell it me when I return? He'll be away.
He's going to BUSTED's, in Hertfordshire to-morrow.
My Cottage is near the road, will he stop the night, and over a pipe
he could tell me all about it. He accepts.
CAZELL has his. luggage ready, so we start. I complain of luggage.
"I'll tell you what you ought to do,” says CAZELL.
N.B. I subsequently discover that this is CaZELL's peculiarity; he
is always telling people "What they ought to do.”. He is great in
dodges," and apparently there is not a single subject he is not well
up in. Most useful fellow,
CAZELL.
As to luggage, he says, “You ought to get one of SPANKER AND
Tickett's bags. Those are the men : only six guineas. Put every.
thing in ’em for a fortnight."

MELBOURNE AND MELBOURNE.
By the law of Victoria—the colony as well as
the QUEEN—any person who has been convicted
of felony can be forbidden to reside there.
But the pardoned Fenians have been convicted
of felony.
Therefore the pardoned Fenians can be for-
bidden to reside there.
We may add that, if they are forbidden, and
don't quit within seven days, they are liable to
imprisonment, bard labour, and forfeiture of
goods.
What then ?
They may be forbidden, or they may not.
If they are not, well.
If they are, well too.
Let well alone.
“Can't you let it alone?" was what the late
LORD MELBOURNE was accustomed to say to his
colleagues on occasion. He would certainly say
so, if he were now Premier, on the apprehended
expulsion, by the Colonial Government, of forty-
odd pardoned Fenians from the town synonymous

SCHOOLS OF HUMANE SCIENCE.
Miss BURDETT Coutts's proposal to make kindness to dumb crea-
tures a branch of education is a happy thought, and, as such, commends
itself especially to Punch. It is erroneously imagined that the persons
whose education has hitherto been neglected in this particular, for the
most part occupy a station at the bottom of the social scale. Surely,
gentlemen accustomed to shoot tame pigeons for fun, in so doing
practise a recreation not at all dissimilar, in point of humanity, for
example, to the sport of forcing a pig through a hole which is too
small for him. The higher classes, some members of them, need
tuition in clemency to the lower animals. There are Swells who, no
less than Cads, want lessons in their duty towards their subordinate
neighbours. Education has been described as teaching the young
idea how to shoot. The supplementary education which Miss BURDETT
Courts has proposed would teach the Gun Club how not to shoot ; at
least as they are wont at Wormholt Scrubbs. If it taught them how
to shoot, it would teach them so to shoot as never to break their birds'
legs and wings, but always kill them outright, which indeed would
perhaps be more merciful than wringing their necks, in case they were
wanted for a pigeon-pie.

THE FOULBOROUGH CATTLE PLAGUE.
This epidemic continues its ravages, particularly in the Eastern and
Western Counties. The exciting cause is a species of Acarus scabiei,
the predominant symptom being an itching palm, whose excessive
irritability can only be allayed by Banker's golden ointment. As a
disease of the body politic it requires to be vigorously stamped out.
and we trust that the Commissioners now sitting will put the govern-
ment stamp upon it. Millionnaires who cherish political aspirations
must not be permitted to touch the Polls, except with clean hands.
The Booths to which the Foulborough Cattle are driven should be
limewashed-disinfectants liberally used in committee rooms, narrow
passages fumigated, and local attornies deodorised.
It has been observed and verified by Cabmen, that you cannot mix
much with horses without acquiring a love of chaff. Nor can certain
susceptible constitutions come in contact with "a Gen one," &c., with-

MORE NEW NOVELS.
Rare news for young ladies! The book market, we hear, is glutted
with new Novels. By the help of a clairvoyant we mention one or
two which probably, ere long, will be in everybody's hands :-
The Deal Door: a romantic story by the Author of The Ivory Gate.
My Friend's Grandmother : a sentimental sequel to My Enemy's
Daughter.
Ins and Outs of Life: a realistic novel, by the Author of Up and Doron
the World.
Declined with Thanks : a sequel to the love story of Twice Refused.
The Pie and the Pudding : a domestic Novel, by the writer of The
Crust and the Cake.
In Corduroys and Highlows: a rustic story, by the Author of In Silk
Attire.
Stingy Doings.
MRS. MALAPROP, who has read that the Bishops attending the
Pope's great Council at Rome are to receive an allowance, “varying
between 6s. 8d. and 10s. a day," says that she now understands why
it is called the “Economical” Council. She is thankful to think
(Mrs. M. is an exemplary member of the Established Church) that our

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TAFFY is a Welshman
Taffy's not a thief,
Taffy's mutton's very good,
Not so good his beef:
I went to Taffy's house,
Several things I saw,
Cleanliness and godliness,
Obedience to the law.
If Taffy rides to my house,
Or unto Pat's doth swim,
I think my Taffy will remark
That we might learn of him.
He doesn't drink, my Taffy,
(Not, leastways, as a rule,)
He goes to Chapel regular,
And sends his boys to school.
He dresses well on Sunday,
His family the like,
He's not too fond of over-work,
But seldom cares to Strike.
He never lurks behind a hedge
To pay his rent with slugs.
Up craggy hills of steep incline
His garden-mould he lugs,
And there he grows his garden,
His cabbages and leeks,
His Kids get green meat in their mouths,
And roses in their cheeks.
PUNCH TO WALES.
Taffy is a Welshman
And glories in the name,
To laugh at which enjoyment
Appears to me a shame.
You compliment the Scotchman,
Who talks of BRUCE and BURNS,
You tolerate the Irishman
Who vaunts ancestral Kerns.
You're nuts on your own pedigree,
Won't call it English, fair,
But prate of “ Anglo-Saxons,”
Till Reviewers nearly swear.
Why shouldn't gallant Taffy,
Have his relics and his bones,
Llewellyns and Cadwallos,
And Griffyevanjones ?
To say nothing of the question
Whether Taffy's mother-tongue
Wastn't quite a fine old language
When all of ours were young.
He says he has good Poets,
Leave him his own opinion,
You like obscure old ballads,
And Taffy likes Englynion.
Pray, are not "moel,
And “Morwyns" (pretty rogues)
At least as good as "birks" and "braes”

By Aberglaslyn's hoary bridge,
And the Swallow's Roaring Rage,
By the Trouts of Capel Curig,
By Carnarvon's Eagled tower,
The smile of placid Tan-y-Bwlch,
And the frown of Penmanmaur.

And never be put down.

Wife. “ BUT, GEORGE DEAR, MR. SMITH KEEPS A BROUGHAM FOR HIS WIFE !"

There goes Puss in boots, or in shoes with high heels,
And buckles, as belles drawn by HOGARTH you see,
And TENNIEL may draw them that imitate me.

Those heels give that "Grecian bend"--just like my own,

The girls are crazy:
Highty-tighty, the fashions, hey ho !
What turrets and towers of topknots instead,
Of hats or of bonnets on top of the head,
Piled tier above tier in a comical shape,
With a fly-away feather and morsel of crape !

What dowager-trains at fine dinners and balls,
Which, going down-stairs, a man treads on and falls,
Or dancing, the skirt of his partner off rends
To the cost and the grief of her parents and friends!

Ah, there, I've no patience with them that I meet,
With draggletails trapesing along in the street;

A Benefactor to Birmingham.
The Town Council of Birmingham have decreed a statue to MR.
Josiah Mason for "munificent and enlightened benevolence," exerted
in the foundation, erection, and endowment of almshouses, at a cost of
above a quarter of a million, at Edgington. An announcement of this
fact by a contemporary is headed, “THE BIRMINGHAM PEABODY."
This is complimentary to MR. PEABODY, but not so either to MR.
Mason, or to Birmingham. MR. MASON ought, when spoken of as a
benefactor to Birmingham, to be styled MR. Mason of Birmingham,
and not described as the Birmingham, which the vulgar will be sure to
call the Brummagem, PEABODY.
New Officials.
MRS. MALAPROP is still mightily taken up with the POPE's " Econo-
mical” Council, and reads all that the papers say about it. Her
present difficulty is a statement that "the Bishops will be received in
collective audiences, to which they will be introduced by categories.”
Who, she wants to know, are these "categories"? Ushers, she 'sup-
poses, or Popish beadles, or something of that sort.

In Autumn time, when, sere and brown,
The leaves begin to tumble down,
To roam, at evening, in a wood
Of reverend old oaks, is go
For pilgrims, fog-proof who can rove
Through rising mist, the dusky grove.
Abroad when shard-born beetles fly,
Hum in the ear, hit nose and eye,
The wanderer at that hour will mark,
In forests can in Richmond Park-
Great flocks of rooks, which, dense as bees,
Swarm in the air and in the trees.
They cloud the sky with rustling wings,
The forest with their clamour rings,
As cawing, cawing, still they keep
Till night falls, and, at roost, they sleep.
With clack of garrulous jackdaws,
Of those rooks cawing what 's the cause ?

Unlike all that confounded talking :
Those platitudes, like snores sonorous,
Which papers, by reporting, bore us
With several columns of a speech-
Hardly a single thought in each,
And that you seek for as you may
A needle in a rick of hay.

Full as momentous as the speeches.

Whether we can, or can't, name 'em!

Owns no priesthood supernatural;
Little in his works you'll find
On Church-power to loose and bind;
Apostolical succession,
He refines to an expression;
Rash lay tendencies be feeds,
Dagmas to postpone to deeds,
While his general tone invites
To put ceremonial rites
Far below Faith, Hope, and Charity-
Deadliest note of secularity!

CONDOLE WITH ROYALTY.
THE PRINCE OF WALES has again been suffering from an attack of Provincial
Loyalty. Before, when it was our painful duty to make the public acquainted
with a similar seizure, it was on the occasion of His Royal Highness's visit to Hall
in company with the Princess, when between them they gallantly underwent the
fatigue of receiving, we think, five Addresses in hot weather. But Hall is outdone
by Chester-a city is before a mere borough; a new Town Hall is a greater
thing than a new Dock;—so, though the Prince went alone to Chester, he was not
let off under six Addresses levelled at him. l. By the Lord Lieutenant and a
number of the Magistrates of the county. 2. By the Freemasons of the City
3. By the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses. 4. By the Bishop, Dean, and
Chapter. 5. By the Roman Catholic Clergy, and, 6. By the Nonconformist
Ministers. (What were the "Friendly Societies wearing their sashes” about, not
to add another to the pile? But above all, how is the absence to be explained of
the manufacturers of the staple of the county, the well known and highly respected
Cheshire Cheese?)
• The wording of the narrative of the "Earl of Chester's” visit, leads us to hope
that all these outbursts of loyalty were not read as well as presented, and in two
instances at least, it is consolatory to find that the Prince merely" bowed his
acknowledgments."
Had the PRINCESS OF WALES been with her husband at Chester, it is impossible
to say what number the Addresses might not have reached; for of course the
Danish residents, the married ladies, the milliners and dressmakers, and other
influential bodies, would have expressed their attachment, devotion and respect,
through the medium of illuminated vellum.
Like the allowance of bridesmaids at a wedding, the supply of Addresses on
the occasion of a Royal visit, seems gradually to increase, and it may be that a few
years hence the PRINCE OF WALES will look back with a sigh of regret to that

GENTLE HYACINTHUS,
In the days of old,
Was to Dan Apollo
Dearer than his gold;
Dearer than the cattle,
All and every one,
Grazing in the golden
Pastures of the sun;
Dearer than the day beams,
Which that lord of light
Opened in the morning,
Bottled up at night.
Gentle HYACINTHUS
Perished, it is said,
Zephyrus the jealous
Knocked him on the head :
Hit him with the discus
Whilst he was at play;
Weltering in his life blood
HYACINTHUS lay.
From that crimson fountain
Beautifully grew
Hyacinths unnumber'd,
With their bells of blue.
FATHER HYACINTHUS,
In these modern days,
Got from Pio Nono
Kudos great and praise ;
HYACINTHUS REDIVIVUS. A BALLAD.
Till he took to preaching
Doctrines heterodox;
Then upon his cranium
Got he cruel knocks.
Pro sits, like Phæbus,
Throned above the hills,
And the world with daylight
At his pleasure fills.
All the reins of knowledge
Loosens he, or pulls,
O'er the verdant pastures
Fulminating Bulls.
And for HYACINTHUS
Felt he great regard,
Whilst PÈRE HYACINTIUS
Was a winning card.
'Till those wanton Zephyrs
Treacherously came,
Making HYACINTHUS
Play a losing game.
" Popularis aura,"
(80 POPE Pius said)
Came and turned the Father
HYACINTHUS' head.
So upon his cranium
Knocked they cruel knocks,
As on those who utter
Doctrines heterodox.
But alas! the traitor,
Though they gave him rope,
Would not hang himself, no,
Not to please the POPE.
Still, to hear his preaching
Eagerly there flew
Fashionable Paris,
Savans, and “bas bleus,"
So they just pronounced him
Heterodox and hated,
From the verdant pastures
Excommunicated !
Father HYACINTHUS
He has run away,
Tother side the Atlantic
Little games to play.
Zephyrs gently waft him
To that land of hope ;
Brother Sam he owns not
Any "airthly" Pope.
There he 'll live a new life,
Lecturing Broadway swells,
Whilst there hang upon him
Bluest Yankee belles.
So shall HYACINTHUS
Prove the legend true-
Still the crushed flower liveth
With its bells of blue !

notice of dismissal.
The Dean of Ripon (Dr. M'NEILE) never
goes beyond the precincts of the Deanery,
except on Sundays, lest he should see photo-
graphs of Dr. TEMPLE and Dr. Pusey in the
shop windows. He has felt it to be his
painful duty to decline social intercourse
with those families whose sons are being
educated at Rugby.
The Dean of Carlisle (DR. CLOSE) is utterly
reckless, and has taken to smoking.
The Dean of Exeter (DR. Boyd) was for
some time buoyed up with the expectation
that MR. GLADSTONE would (write him a

as Bishop instead of Dr. TEMPLE; but the
arrival of the congé d'élire (by Parcels Deli-
very)_bas put an end to all these hopes.
The Deanery blinds are drawn closely down,
and will remain so until the sad ceremony is
over. The Cathedral bells are muffled, and
the vergers spend their leisure time in read-
ing MOSHEJM, MILNER, SIMEON's Sermons,
and the publications of the Religious Tract
Society. The Dean is surrounded by Arch-
deacons, and is able to take nourishment.
The younger clergy of the diocese are going
through a course of controversial theology in
night classes under the superintendence 'of
the Rural Deans. Cornwall is tranquil, the
miners caring more about a chapel than a
Temple.
ARCHDEACON DENISON has lost all interest
in harvest homes, cricket clubs, church
unions, the Daily Telegraph, &c. It is ru-
moured that if he is passed over in the
nomination to the vacant Deanery of Ely, he
will either head a party of seceders, and build
a cathedral in the Falkland Islands, or
remain at home and join a neighbouring
sect-the Plymouth Brethren. His unceasing
regret is that he is not a Member of the
Chapter of Exeter, and so loses the chance
of enjoying all the consequences of a pre-
munire.
We have the greatest pleasure in an-
nouncing that MR. GLADSTONE is well and
hearty, does not neglect bis business or his
family, can eat his dinner, has not turned
grey in a single night, and, so far, has not
started up from sleep, exclaiming, with a
countenance in which terror and remorse
struggle for the mastery, "Oh, my Church !

It will grieve but not surprise our readers
to hear that Dr. TEMPLE has been com-
pletely prostrate, from the moment he read
that at a meeting of the clergy of the diocese
of Carlisle, CHANCELLOR BURTON declared
that “he himself would not appoint DR.

MORALISING A GOSSAMER.
A YOUNG Sporting Swell and his sweetheart were walking
Over Newmarket Heath (Beacon course), 'tother day;
With his arm round her waist cuddled close, they went talking,
For the morning was foggy and frosty and grey.
As he stooped to the sweet lips that prattled beside him,
He thought of his plungings, of croppers come down,
And he wished he had not been so rash, to confide him
To the perilous passage from green to done-brown.
Now on Newmarket Heath there grows many a gorse thicket,
Their branches with spikes of gold blossom beset,
Whence-fitting portière for Titania's wicket-
Hangs the dew-spangled curtain of Gossamer.net.
The Gossamers blew in the sporting swell's eye,
And the sporting swell gave them his “D!” for a benison,
But the sweet lips they checked him, and pouted “Oh fie!”
And quoted, from thy In Memoriam, my TennysON,
That beautiful line, how the Gossamers twinkle,
On the calm autumn morning to green and to gold.
But the swell said, “My sweet, you're not up to the wrinkle-
The poet had put on the pot and been sold.
“ Yes, the Laureate must have been plunging, I'm certain,
And in that line has darkly forth shadowed his woes;
His grief for his friend he may use as a curtain,
But that in memoriam’is DIDDLUM & Co.'s.
The green is the poet's, the gold is the losings
Dropped by him to 'the Ring and the Book,' and their plebs :
And the Gossamers he has wove into his musings,
Were Newmarket Heath one's—those cursed spider's webs ! ”
LATEST NEWS FROM ROME.
By a telegram just received from the Vatican, we learn that the fol.
lowing propositions (amongst others) will be submitted to the Ecume-
nical Council, as indispensable for every faithful son and daughter of
the Church to believe :-
1. That the States of the Church, and all other Catholic kingdoms,
are the most orderly, moral, well-governed, happy, enlightened, and
prosperous countries under the sun.
2. That England and all other heretical nations are the most dis-
orderly, immoral, ill-governed, miserable, ignorant, and declining
countries on the face of the earth.
3. That England will be converted to Catholicism, and not have a
single Protestant left within her borders before the end of the century.
4. That the QUEEN OF Spain is the most exemplary sovereign living,
and
5. That if the Pope, being infallible, says that the moon is made of
green cheese, it must be so.
Another Nuisance.
Is there no public body-the Corporation of London, or the Metro-
politan Board of Works or the St. Pancras Guardians—that has power
to put an end to the offensive practice of disfiguring the pavement
with puffs of plays, photographs, pickles, &c. ? Can no one forbid

"A COMPARISON WITH A VERY LONG TAİL.”
A CORRESPONDENT of the Times has taken the trouble to recal the
horrors of the Neapolitan imprisonments, so terribly denounced, some
years ago, by MR. GLADSTONE. In that the recital reminds us of the
good deed of the PREMIER, it is well; but assuredly it was needless
for the purpose of demolishing the idiotic comparison, by a blatant
of the condition of the Neapolitan victims of a Popish despot
to that of the Fenian convicts, sentenced by British law. The imper-
tinent folly was demolished by the scornful laugh of all rational men.
Mr. Punch was reminded of a passage in one of DOUGLAS JERROLD'S
plays. To a lady, of no particularly good character, who is adorning
herself at the glass, enters an acquaintance, who quotes, “So sat the
chaste LUCRETIA at her toilette, and'-and there the parallel ends."
The Neapolitans were in prison, the Fenians are—and that's the single
resemblance.

A lurch. My camp-stool nearly fell. A wave has broken over us
from somewhere. Helpless. Can't do anything. Let waves break
over us. Let the water trickle down to my feet. Very cold. Captain
comes up unsteadily, but quite well and smoking. He has been having
hot brandy-and-water with the Admiral. He asks us, briskly, How
we're getting on? Quite the gay Sailor, eh ?” he inquires jovially of
me. I try to smile, I would smile (to be something of the gay sailor,
and show my spirit to the last), but I feel that the slightest relaxation
of face, or alteration of position, would be fatal. CHILVERN and myself
are against the paddle-box, with nothing to hold on by, and a strong
inclination to fall face downwards on the deck at every lurch, or roll,
or whatever the horrid action of the ship is called.
The vessel now takes a very peculiar motion, and I feel myself, as it
were, following all the very peculiar motions of the vessel in detail, as
if by some internal (and infernal) machinery. She goes down with a
rush, quivering: so do I: that is, I don't move from where I am, but
the machinery does it. It seems as if I'd swallowed the engines. The
vessel slides or glides, and then comes up with a sort of scooping
motion : exactly the same with me.
I wonder to myself how CHILVERN feels. I turn my head slightly
to look at him, and notice that he is staring before him in a blank,
helpless manner. The machinery gives a surging groan every time we
dive down as if we were going right under the sea, and I feel as if I was
being lowered into my boots; we come up again with a rush, and a
noise between a shriek and a groan from the machinery. I feel myself
entirely dependent on the machinery.
The Captain comes up (he is pacing the deck to keep himself warm)
and observes that" We've got a deuced fine passage;" and adds, that
“He shouldn't think there'd be a soul ill to-night."-I can't answer
him : there's only a glimmer of hope in his speech. My thoughts

NOTE AND QUERY.
(With Answer.)
DUNROBIN CASTLE. A discussion is being
carried on in Notes and Queries, and the
Scottish papers, as to the derivation of the
name of this famous castle. If Punch had
been applied to, he would have settled the
point at once. Æneas, fourth Earl of Suther-
land (A.D. 1473), was married to HELENA
ROBINA JESSIE (second daughter of the Master
of Stair), a beautiful lady; but like some
beautiful ladies of the present age, immode-
rately fond of dress. She spent, daily, many
hours at her toilette, to the annoyance of
her Lord, who, when he wanted her to go
out with him, would stand at the foot of the
turret stairs, and call, “In the muckle deil's
name, woman, wull ye ne'er ba' done robing?"
that is, “Will you never be dressed P” The
cry was so often repeated that it became a
household, or rather a stronghold word, and
so got fixed as a name to the castle.

GUARDIANS AND GUINEA-PIGS.
THE subjoined newspaper paragraph will naturally excite the indig-
nant alarm of many Vestrymen and Guardians :-
“ VERDICT OF MANSLAUGHTER AGAINST A RELIEVING OFFICER.–At an
inquest held at Bradford, on Saturday, into the cause of death of a mason's
labourer, named M MENNA, a verdict of manslaughter was returned against
WILLIAM BURNISTON, one of the relieving officers, who had neglected to give
relief to the deceased when in a state of destitution, and whose death had in
consequence been accelerated. BURNISTON was committed for trial, and
admitted to bail.”
Really this verdict is extremely unparochial-- as unparochial as it is
unprecedented. But the fear which parochial officers, with any sense
of their situation, must feel, is, that it will constitute a precedent. If,
taking it as an example, coroner's juries get into the way of imputing
manslaughter to relieving officers whose omission to afford due relief
has helped to slay paupers, they will soon go on to subject those
servants' masters, whose failure of making sufficient eleemosynary or
other necessary arrangements, for which they were responsible, has had
the same effect, to indictment on the same charge. A perilous pro-
spect, my masters.
Grave apprehension must also be excited in the minds of Railway
Directors by a verdict of manslaughter, for neglect of duty conducing
to fatal consequences, returned against a functionary so respectable as
a Relieving Officer. They have serious reason to dread that some
coroner's juries will, in cases of loss of life by collisions of trains and
other fatal accidents occurring on Railways, begin to charge liability
for criminal negligence not only on çareless or forgetful pointsmen,
stokers, or engineers, but also on their superiors, who ought to have
taken precautions for want of which people got killed. In many cases,
indeed, those juries will perbaps find verdicts of manslaughter not
against a Railway Company's stupid or sleepy inferior servants, but
against the gentlemen responsible for hiring such servants at wages
insufficient to procure competent ones, or for employing so few as
to render them unfitted for the discharge of their duties by overwork
and fatigue.

IRISH FENIAN FUN.
The Irish treason-mongers, or Fenian
journalists, it seems, are telling their cus-
tomers, in case of a rebellion in Ireland, to
count on co-operation by the strong Repub-
lican party which they pretend exists in Eng,
land, together with the Irish population of
our large towns. This extravagance, of
course, is merely rampant Irish fun-for
sale however. Might we be allowed to deal
in the same article? What objection would
there be to the counterpart of such humorous
writing in English newspapers ? Suppose
a number of London journals, affecting to
believe the Fenian fudge of a dangerous Irish
population in our chief towns, were to keep
on, day by day, exhorting the British public
to re-enact the Sicilian Vespers, and mas-
sacre every Irishman in Great Britain.
What eff.ct would such rant produce on our
quick-witted Irish friends ? They would
scream with laughter at the ridiculous
ravings of scribes, who exercise their one
talent for unbounded vituperation, instead
of sticking to their lasts, or earning a decent
living as tailors.

ECONOMICAL COUNSEL,
THE Ecumenical Council will comprise
between six and seven hundred Bishops,
many of whom, belonging to Italy, the East,
and other Missions, are so indigent that the
POPE will have to board and lodge them,
This cannot but be very expensive for His
Holiness—almost enough to make him cry
“Non possumus !” The burden thus devolved
upon him, however, it will be in his power
considerably to lighten, by prescribing, as a
condition calculated to further the Council's
deliberations, the frequent practice of fasting
as hard and as long as the Fathers are able.
Could he not sell a dispensation from absti-
nence to the richer Prelates, and dispense
himself?
By the expedient above suggested the deci-
sions of the Council would be expedited as
well as its cost diminished. But there is
one objection to it. DR. JOHNSON said that
fasting made him peevish. It might pro-
voke the Members of the Ecumenical Coun-
cil to declare the Pope not infallible.
THE BOBBY AND HIS BOOTS.
THE Police are hereafter to have their
boots made in the Convict prisons. The
Pall Mall Gazette expresses a hope-
" That no vindictiveness on the part of the
convicts will lead them to cause trifling annoy-
ance, such as inserting the point of a small brad
in the heel of the Policeman's boot.”
There is no fear of anything of the kind.
The convicts know such' tricks would make
the police, instead of bootless, only more
effective. We have the authority of a great
Latin poet for contending that the more
policemen might be lamed in this way, the more
convicts would be nabbed. See Horace:
« Raro antecedentem scelestum

My dear Sir John THWAITES, till you've lowered our rates,
Settled sewers, embankments, and thoroughfares;
Cease pæáns to raise in Self-government's praise,
In the midst of a London your role that obeys,
Yet worse than the pettiest borough fares.
While of your Board of Works in the public mind lurks
Something more than suspicion unpleasant,
Of contractors' paths eased, by kind hands, duly greased,
Of small rogues made examples, great rogues left unteased-

Father Thames poisoned still with your sewage,
Though the dose he once drank from a million of 'rills

While vestrymen talk, and leave fever to stalk
Through pestilent court and foul alley,
While the rates that should go his foul might to o'erthrow,
On'superfluous officials our Vestries bestow,
Who all for Self-government rally-
While in silent reproof our best men stand aloof
From Vestry debates' rough and tumble,
Where jobbers can boast that 'tis they rule the roast,
And pennywise Selfishness musters its host,
In defence of the strongholds of Bumble-
While St. Pancras can doom pauper-lives, to make room

The fact that garotters are beginning to

LOOK UP YOUR LATIN.
“THE BISHOPS AT THEIR LATIN.-A letter from Rome says that the
bishops who at that time had already reached their destination had been
making a trial of their Latin, and found it satisfactory neither in quantity
nor quality. A few days before a deliberation had taken place in the cham-
bers of CARDINAL ALTIERI on the subject of an Address to the POPE. Every
one tried to express his opinion in the purest Ciceronian he could command,
but the result was unfortunately merely a modern adaptation of the scene
which once took place in the plain of Shinar. In this confusion some of the
American bishops began to speak French, and the conversation became tole-
rably intelligible till the BISHOP OF REGGIO protested, and declared that all
ecclesiastical matters must be discussed in Latin. The consequence was that
the victory was won by those who had not quite forgotten their declensions
and conjugations; the rest signed their names in humble resignation without
attempting to take any part in the debate."
THE bisnops, all figg'd out in cassock and cope
Of shiniest silk and of satin,
Were met to present an Address to the Pope,
But found for their eloquence limited scope;
So few of the lot could talk Latin !

And many an orthodox rhymer,

But any small schoolboy, in jacket and

I WISH I knew for certain, BISHOP TROWER,
How to pronounce your venerable name
Whether it rhymes with spiritual power,
Or, which of course would be about the same,
It sounds as gently as a summer shower :-
Or whether you pronounce it lower, slower,
And make it TROWER!
My ignorance may stamp me as a noodle,
And may unfit me for my present task;
But I'm afraid to ask,
However much I wish,
Your worthy secretaries, MR. FISH
And MR. BOODLE !
O BISHOP TEMPLE's would be overthrower-
O BISHOP TROWER-
l'here may be truth in much that you maintained,
But in your case there is this serious flaw-
You choose to act against our English law :-
For this, among the rest, were you ordained ?
Besides, another matter you forget;
No one has made you yet
“The Master of the Temple,” DOCTOR TROWER!
True, once upon a time
And this is DR. TEMPLE's only crime-
He wrote an Article'twas one of seven :-
And though of heresy it gave no sign,
No trace of schism you could well define,
But spoke, as good men eak, of earth and heaven,
Against that article you take your stand.
Remember, good divine,
That with the self-same hand
Which wrote the one, he signed the Thirty-Nine !
As for his life, that happens to be known,
And is at least as noble as your own.
Fathers and mothers know what he has done
For many a dear and well-beloved son;
How many a lad has learnt to be a man
In ARNOLD's school, on ARNOLD's Christian plan.
Now, in the ancient city of the West,
Through no ambitious yearnings of his own,
But in obedience to a high behest,
He takes his place upon the Bishop's throne.
Semper Fidelis ” says the proud old scroll
Of the Cathedral-city, where, to-day,-
Whatever TROWER, FISH, and BOODLE say-
Men write the name of TEMPLE on the roli :-
Semper Fidelis ?”. Faithful to the last,
If we may judge his future from his past !
0, Orthodoxy's flower!
0, Reverend Doctor TROWER!
If still your ardent spirit it should vex

EXPERIENTIA DOCET.
Master George (whispers). “I SAY! Kıtır! Has MAMMA BEEN TELLING YOU Soe'd GIVE You 'A LOVELY SPOONFUL OP
DELICIOUS CURRANT JELLY, O SO NICE, SO VERY NICE ?".
Miss Kitty. “Ess! CULLEN' JELLY! O 80 ni', so WILLY NI'!”
Master George. “THEN DON'T TAKE IT!!”
A PHILOSOPHER'S CHRISTMAS.
PROFESSOR JORKS, as usual, ate salt fish
On Christmas Day, because he likes the dish,
And then boiled mutton, which, in his belief,
Is something preferable to roast beef.
PROFESSOR JORKS plum-pudding and mince-pie
Esteems unwholesome; did himself deny.
In apple-dumpling did indulge instead
That couldn't do him any harm, he said.
PROFESSOR JORKS adorned his house with yew
And cypress, on his premises which grew,
For evergreens are evergreens, he thought,
Those that cost nothing better than those bought.
PROFESSOR JORKS announced a Christmas Tree,
Wbich many of his neighbours came to see ;
It was a tree which hadn't any roots :
On it PROFESSOR JORKS had hung his boots.
PROFESSOR JORKS burnt no Yule log, 'tis true,
But on the fire a lump of coal he threw,
And reasoned, "That is every bit as good;
Its fibrous structure shows it once was wood.”
PROFESSOR JORKS no Christmas bowl composed,
He deemed punch better in a jug enclosed,
To hold its fumes in, and its heat prolong.
He made himself some : made it hot and strong.
PROFESSOR JORKS sat, supped, and smoked, and mused,
Until his mind began to get confused;
Zigzag he went to bed; where deep repose
Did quickly sound its trumpet through his nose.
NOT IRISH, BUT SCOTCH.
ARE the years 1870 and 1871 going to be distinguished by an extra
number of months ! This question, deeply interesting to all to whom
"time is money," is asked because of an advertisement, from Edinburgh,
of a forthcoming,"centenary edition” of the Waverly Novels in “twenty.
five monthly volumes,” in which the following promises are made
“The work will be published in monthly volumes, commencing on the
1st of January, 1870; and, if found practicable, the whole set will be
completed on the Centenary day."
As the Centenary of Scott's birthday, which this edition of his
novels, is to commemorate, will occur as early as the 15th of August,
1871; we shall examine with much eagerness the “Prospectus" to
appear in the Magazines for January, as it will no doubt explain the
measures which have been taken for insuring an additional supply of
months, so as to let us have as many as twenty-five between now and
August 1871. The words “if found practicable" make us fear there
may still be some hitch in the arrangements, and that we shall have to
be satisfied with the ordinary number of months, as in previous years.
The National New Year's Gift.
"PARE close the cheese,” cries ROBERT LOWE. "Economy and
Thrift:
Pay us your taxes in a lamp, by way of New Year's Gift.”.
Oh, dear, yes! Oh, most willingly! Too happy. We will go
Short of our beef and pudding, and cry "Save and bless BOB LOWE!”
Seasonable.
If anyone read a statement of intended “City Ward Changes", on
the 21st of December, and noticed the
announcement that “MR. MID-
WINTER retires," did it occur to him as rather a remarkable fact that
Midwinter should retire on the Shortest Day?
