PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PREFACE.
"T SHALL not write a Preface," said ME. PUNCH, without raising his noble head from the green turf on which he
JL was lying, ventre à teñe.
"О! please do!" said the World.
"World," said MB. PUNCH, "you have many merits, and I have never, in all these yean that I have been
keeping you in order, taken a dark view of your character. I like you very much, when you behave yourself."
"You have taught me to do that," said the World, humbly. "How few great complaints have you to make of
me now, compared to the number you used to have."
"That may be," said MB. PUNCH, sternly, " and yet there are plenty of faults in you which I intend to correct.
Don't add vanity to them, you globular peacock. Now, go away. With the thermometer at 80 in the shade (' which
is a great age,' as my friend THOMAS HOOD wrote) I am not disposed to work."
"Yet you reprimand me for want of self-denial and for negligence of duty," urged the World.
"You! who are you? If I may make a law, I may break a law, I suppose. Go away, I say. 'Spare my
slumbers, gently tread the Cave,' (as my friend MB. POPE wrote). Your requirements frequently become bothersome."
"But you have always done a Preface, MB. PUNCH."
"The thermometer was not always at 80 in the shade, World."
"You won't find it so hot, if you apply yourself to thought."
"Shall I not ?—
'Who can hold a fire in hia hand
By thinking of the frosty Caucasus?'
(as my friend MB. SHAKSPEABE wrote)."
"Your pen is a pen of fire, no doubt; but"
"Very properly said. Now, go away."
"It will be an adversity for the Millions," said the World.

"They must learn to bear Adversity. She is a 'daughter of Jove; relentless power; A tamer of the human
breast; Whose iron scourge and torturing hour The bad affright, afflict the best' (as my friend DB. AKENSIDE wrote).
Have you vanished, World? Go and eclipse somebody."
"You are eclipsing yourself," said the World, smartly.
"Well, it does not hurt. 'Non ladit' (as my friend LADY AEBIA said). Do not make me cross, or you may
repent it"
"The World never repents anything."
"Who taught you that precious bit of Lavaterism? It is perfectly false; but I am not in the mood to show
you why. Depart. 'How happy is the blameless PUNCH'S lot, The world forgetting, by' What are you making
that unseemly noise for?"
"That you may not finish the quotation. When the World forgets You, may it roll away, a blackened ball, into
everlasting space, and, destitute of gravitation, buzz like a Chimera in vacuo, devouring second intentions."
"You are a Muddler, as ever, but you make me smile. Eternal smiles your emptiness betray—excites, I mean.
Is there anything left in that silver tankard?"
"Plenty. Ice islands bob in a sea of amber, and gentij stir it to the emitting of an aroma that refreshes all
the senses ere the lips are cooled by the beady draught."
"World, you ass, your intimacy with the clouds turns your brain. Clear it with the draught you speak of.
'Cup yourself till you go round,' again to cite Eternal W."
"I drink to you, respectfully," said the World; "and I should do so rejoicingly, if I could couple the Preface
with my toast."
"How dare you talk of toast this weather? Volcanoes take you; hold your aggravating tongue. In fact, if you
could learn generally a little more love of ' the Silences' (as my friend THOMAS GABLYLE says), it would be better for
some who have the misfortune to co-exist with you. It was not for nothing that the Scandinavian theologiete saw a
Beign of Silence as the end of you, when battering Odin and bawling Thor should have been extinguished by the
excellent Wolf Fenris and the respectable Serpent his friend, to whom my best homage«. Why luch perpetual babble?
I will set a good example."
"Sophistical excuse for your laziness," said the World, provoked out of patience. "It is for a Teacher to speak,
and to speak continually, while the Taught listen. You are a Great Teacher, and you are lying under that tree like a
great log."
"Deducting the comparison, which is inappropriate, for my friend MB. CHABLES KEENE has made me look like
anything but a log," said MB. PUNCH (with as much dignity as his attitude would allow), "you are right; and, therefore,
in again suggesting to you to take something to drink, I authorise the publication of this interview as the instructive
Preface to my

POLITICAL SUMMARY.
THE Session of 1870 was opened by Commission on
the 8th of February, the QUEEN being unable,
through indisposition, to take part in the proceedings of the
day. As was the case in the previous year, a measure
which solely affected Ireland, proved to be a prominent
topic of the Eoyal Speech—the Irish Land Bill. In 1869
the Irish Church Bill absorbed the chief share of the atten-
tion of Parliament. In 1870 the Irish Land Bill occupied
many nights, and gave rise to many discussions, but the
interest it aroused was but languid compared with the
excitement which attended the various stages of the Pis-
establishment Act.
On the 15th of February MR. GLADSTONE introduced the
Bill in a "splendid " speech of three hours' duration. Into
the details of the measure it seems hardly necessary to
enter. Generally it may be said that its object was to pre-
vent landlords turning out their tenants without giving
them compensation for eviction: reversing what was then
the presumption of the law, it presumed all improvements
to be the property of the tenant, and left it to the landlord
to prove the contrary. That some such measure was wanted
was conclusively shown by the division on the second
reading of the Bill, when 453 members voted for, and only
11 against it—certainly MR. GLADSTONE used no exagger-
ation when he spoke of " the handful of opponents."
The Bill received some alterations in Committee, but tho
amendments proposed by the Opposition were mostly nega-
tived. It passed the Commons on tho 30th of May, and on
the 12th of July it returned to them considerably amended
by the Conservative Lords. Of these amendments, some of
which were opposed to the principles of the Bill, the great
majority were reversed by the Lower House, and on the 1st
of August the Irish Land Bill received the Eoyal assent.
Ireland at this time was in a very disturbed state. (See
"Cartoons, "pp. 101,111, HI.) The Government were fully
sensible of the necessity for vigorous measures in dealing
with Fenians, agrarian assassins, demagogues, and seditious
writers, and brought forward on the 17th of March a strong
Bill for the repression of crime (" Peace Preservation Bill "),
which only found thirteen opponents on the second reading,
and speedily passed into law.
Perhaps the most important result of the Session was
1 the Government Education Act, introduced and carried
, through by ME. "W. E. FORSTEB, the Vice-President of the
; Committee of Council of Education. Tho following is an
epitome of the Bill as originally framed :—
"The measure was based upon the principle of direct compulsion ач
regarded the attendance of children, and, to effect this, power was to be
given to each School-Board to frame bye-laws compelling tho attendance nt
1 school of all children from five to twelve years of age within their district.
i The Schools formed by tho Bill would be subject to three regulationn :—
1. It must be shown Unit they posccss a certain amount of efficiency in
education before a Government grant will be made. 2. They will be re-
i quired to submit to the examination of an undenominational Inspector.
i 3. A " conscience clause" will be attached аз n condition of the receipt c»f
Government assistance. The management of the Schools would bo vested
In Boards, to be locally elected. The School fee.» would nut bo abolished.
Power would, however, be given to tho School-Boards to establish free
Schools in localities where the poverty of the inhabitants rendered them
desirable, and in tho paying Schools the Boards would also liavc the power
i to grant free tickets to children whoso parents were unable to pay tho fees,
care being taken that no stigma accompanied their possession. The Hill
proposed to supplement tho funds, necessary to cany out the scheme, l»y
local rates and by grants from tho public treasury, in the estimated propor-
tion of one-third from each source, tho rcmainipg third coming from the
school fees. If the charge upon the poor-rate under this head .should exceed
in any pariah threepence in tho pound, a special additional grant would be

INTRODUCTION.
made to such parish from the public funds. With respect to the religious
aspect of the education to be impRrted in the public schools, the Bill made
no order, neither saying that religion »hould ho excluded from the course
of lessons, nor that it should he taught in any particular way."—InvjNc's
Aniw.lt o/ottr Time.
A three-nights' debato took placo on the second reading
of tho Bill, but there was no division. On the motion fur
going into Committee MR. GLADSTONE announced con-
siderable alterations. They may be thus summarised.
Although education was not to bo made merely secular,
Local Boards might exclude Eoligious Teaching from
schools that should be founded upon rates. They might not
introduce any religious element—catechisms, for instance—
except the reading and expounding of the Bible. Schools
partly supported by voluntary contributions, partly by
public grants, to derive nothing from tho local rates, and
to take to the Time Table Conscience Clause. The further
consideration of the Bill in its altered form was postponed
for a few days, and its subsequent history will be traced in
the introduction to the next volumo.
French politics arc too often noticed in tho ensuing pages
to be passed over without comment. The following out-
line is mainly gathered from A n nah of Our Time. It will bo
remembered that towards tho close of 18G9 the EMPEROR
NAPOLEON, on tho resignation of the Eouher Cabinet,
indicated his intention to put an end to personal Govern-
ment by authorising M. EMILE OLLIVIER, a member of
the Loft Centre or Moderate Liberal party, to construct a
Constitutional Ministry. The Ollivier Ministry camo into
office in January, and in March the EMPEROR desired its
head to lay before him tho draft of a Senatâs Consultum,
'' which shall firmly fix the fundamental dispositions
deriving from the Plébiscite of 1852, and which shall divide
the legislative power between the two Chambers, and restore
to the nation that portion of constituent power it had dele-
gated tome." Tho Senatâs Consultum wasiutroducod into the
Senate towards the end of the month by M. OLLIVIER, who,
a few days afterwards, announced that in consequence of
the proposed reforms affecting the essential basis of the
Plébiscite of 1851, the ЕМГЕНОН had determined to submit
the Senatih Consultum to the approval of the people. Accord-
ingly an Imperial decree was published, convoking the
French nation for the 8th of May, to accept or reject the
following Plebiscite—"The people approve the liberal
reforms effected in the Constitution, since 1860 by tho
EMPEROR, with the co-operation of the great bodies of the
State, and ratify the Senatâs Consultum of the 20th of April,
1870." An Imperial proclamation was circulated iu sup-
port of this declaration. Tho result of the nation's voting
was as foUows—Ayes, 7,336,434; Noes, 1,560,709; and
the EMPEROR, onroceiving the report, expressed his opinion
that in the question between Eevolution and the Empire,
the country had decided in favour of the system which
guaranteed order and liberty. lie then went on to shape
out a programme of future reforms.
Two episodes in this account of French politics call for a
few additional words. The Legislative Body voted by a
largo majority for the prosecution of M. HENRI DE ВОСПЕ-
FORT for seditious articles iutho "Marseillaise," and he was
sentenced to fine and imprisonment. Two of M. OLLIVIER'S
colleagues, COUNT DARU, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
and M. BUFFET, withdrew from the Ministry, owing to a
difference of opinion on the Plebiscite. COUNT DARU was
succeeded by tho Duc DE GBAMONT.
One other foreign demonstration remains to bo noticed—
the (Ecumenical or General Council at Rome. The Ultra-
montane party, tho great advocates of the dogma of Papal
Infallibility, were not suffered to have it all their own
way. France and Austria both protested against the declara-
tion of the dogma; eminent ecclesiastics opposed it in tho
Council; and stormy debates arose in the assembly 011 this
and other questions. The issue of all these discussions and
deliberations does not come within the scope of the present
volume.

The United States
government acted with groat promptitude, and the Fenian
leader was arrested by its Marshal. See also " Essence of
Parliament," p. 232 (Friday).
Spoiled Goods.—MR. MERRY (died 1877) was the owner 238
of Macgreyor.
Signs of the Times (verse 7).—See "An American 240
Newton," p. 243.
A "Savage" Wigging.—GLADSTONE and AYRTON. 245
See "Essence of Parliament," p. 232 (Tuesday).
New Book for the Season,—MR. GLADSTONE was at 249
Epsom this year on the Derby Day. Jitventut ¿lundi is
the title of one of his books.
Essence of Parliament (Thursday).—Tho "Edmunds 252
Scandal" was of some years' standing, it having been
proved before a Committee of the House of Lords, so far
back as 1865, that, as Clerk of the Patent Office, MR.
EDMUNDS had committed irregularities in dealing with the
public money. He was committed to prison this year as а
debtor to the Crown for nearly £8,000.
Suspiria Ecclesiœ.—Tho reference is to tho MARQUIS 254
OF BUTE exchanging tho Presbyterian Church of Scotland
for tho Church of Rome, into which ho was received Christ-
mas, 1868. "The Marquis," in Ми. DISRAELI'S recent
novel, Lothair, was thought to bo intended for LORD BUTE;
Corisamle, Catesby, and Grandieon are other characters in
the same book.

WEATHER PROPHECIES FOR
1870.
January will be fine and bright,
in fact quite a second summer,
unless there should IJG a succes-
sion of storms ot either wiud,
rain, or enow, or all thrco Ac-
companied by intense cold. But
this will make no positive altera-
tion in the month itself.
February will be lovely. If it
is not, wri'to to our Oftice; any
complaint shall meet with instant
attention.
Л/arrA, April, May —Prognos-

p-tring tbtj notes eo made with
our own nbove mentioned pro-
gnostications.
The same plan to be pursued
with the otber months.
SCHOLASTIC. — We know' a
naughty little boy who, having
beard it said that "history
repeats itself," pleaded this as
an excuse for his declining to
attempt the repetition of a page
or two of PINNOCK.
Слгтюн ron COLLEGIANS,—

THE ANTIPATHIES OF THE
GREAT.
JFREMY ВЕКТНЛН invariably
fainted at tho sight of a Veteri-
nary Surgeon in evening cos-
tume. COBBETT could not sit in
the room with a French Milliner,
nor LADY JANE GREV with a Dis-
tributor of Stamps. ARCHBISHOP
TILLOTSON asked every stranger
to whom be was introduced
whether he bud any relations in
the Excise; if the answer was
in the affirmative, the Prelate
gazed at his chaplain, and in-
stantly went out nshing: tho
cause of this singular antipathy
lias never been satisfactorily ex-
pi.lined. KIRKK WHITE would go
a mile out of his road to avoid
meeting a waggon of hay SHERI-
DAN turned pale at the sight of
a corkscrew.
HORTICULTURAL,—An old song
makes mention of a pardon of
delight*, under tho name of
"Cupid's Garden." In Cupid's
Garden, choore single flo»ers;
and bewaic of widows' weeds.
IT |s idiotic to tell a real dream.

Derivator.—The word prognos-
tic was originally applied to tho
leader of the Sect of t he Gnostics,
who used to take his followers
out with him for a pic-nic, him-
self providing the luncheon and
carrying the prog-basket. Writ-
ten in full the word was, of
course, Profj-Gnfiftic.
Bicycle.—Electric Bicycles will

Goodwood.—Yes, you are right.
THAT is THE HORSE WHICH WILL
WIN THE DERBY OF 1S70.
SCIENTIFIC GOSSIP.
THE Botanical Gardens in the
Regent's Park have recently re-
ceived most valuable additions
in a pair of boot-trees and a fine
rum-shrub. The grand climac-
teric is now in full perfection,
and the overland Root spreads
rapidly. The railway "plant"
continues to be a great attrac-
tion. Branches of the aristocracy
are frequently found in the Gar-
dens in the summer months,
with many sprigs and youthful
scions of nobility.

“ Two HEADS ARE BETTER

HINTS TO TOURISTS.
WHEN- you arc late for dinner at a table
d'Mtt, be sure you make your entry with
all the noise you can, in order to disturb
more punctual people. Growl and grum-
ble savagely if your soup be getting cold,
or If, when helped to chicken, you only
find the drumstick. The fault, of course,
will have been in a chief degree your
own, and the dinner perhaps bettor than
you get at your own table. But you
should never lose a chanco of making u
complaint, that your neighbours nmy
imagine you are some one of importance.
If you have been educated in a public
school, and know nothing of languages,
except a few Greek paradigms and Latin
nonsense verse?, never bore yourself by
trying to pick up French or German.
Talk English on the Continent with a
slightly foreign accent, which, you know,
is certain to mako it more intelligible.
When people cannot understand you,
raise your voice as though you fancied
they were deaf, and vent some Saxon ex-
pleuve upon them for their ignorance.
THE Telegraph, which is to be univer-
sal, is difficult of explanation to some
ladies. Perhaps this way is the best.
"You know that if you nib a piece of
sealing-wax hard, it will take up little
bite of paper." "Yes." '* Well, extend
the principle, and you will nee how
letters are conveyed by electricity."
"THERE are Mmee," said the pensive
ALPHONSO, "at which I am quite inca-
pable of writing poetry." "Ah," said the
cynical BILL, "those, then, are the times
at which you write verse."
КАСТ гон FOHIIOKIRS.—Stonehenge is

THE ANTIPATHIES OF THE GREAT.
FREDERICK THE GREAT had three par-
ticular dislikes — pease-pudding, я blue
pocket-handkerchief with yellow epots,
and bell-ropes. 8m ISAAC NEWTON never
crossed the threshold of a house in which
white mice were kept. BURKE secreted
himself in the adjoining mews if parsnips
appeared en the dinncr-tablo, having a
rooted aversion to this esculent. QUEEN
ANNE became hysterical at the slightest
nlluftton to a toasting-fork. CARDINAL
WOLBEY shivered all over whenever he
.paflKed a brush-maker's shop. The scent
of Russia leather threw MARY, Queen of
boots, into a tertian ague. If a naval
officer placed a German flute on the side-
board, GRIMALDI Immediately left town
for Brighton ; and to this day thousands
of persons go into a passion at the sound
uf a street-organ.
TO EDITORS AND COMMENTATORS.
IT is generally supposed tbat there Is
no mention of tobacco in SIIAKSPEARE.
But can any one doubt to what he la
referring when he says (in one of In,
sonnets)—
"And keep invention In a noted weed?"
Burely be must mean improvements in
the manufacture of cigare.
SAYINGS AND PROVERBS.
"Not /or Jotepkut!" as that worthy
historian observed playfully, when some
funny Jews attempted to cram him with
sturies for his own work.
"I'll have your Hat / " as the ambitious
Monk said eotto voce to the Cardinal.
ROBINSON says that he cannot express
In words the pity he feels fur the man
who does not drink his best wine, but
keeps it for his friends. ROBINSON for-
gives a woman for being such a slave to
lier drawing-room that she la afraid to
use it, but a man should not be In awe of

HINTS TO TOURISTS.
IF you are put with a friend In a double-
bedded room, bear in mind that inside
walls are only lath and plaster, and that
every word you say will be heard in tho
next room. Therefore carry on your con-
versation at the tip-top of your voice,
:md make as much noise as you can in
packing, .vii'i in splashing, ana in stump-
ing round your room.
Always give to beggars who waylay
you on the road, and if you know their
language, accompany your gift with a
little stagy speech to the effect that all
wo English have more money than we
know how to spend, and it is our duty
when wo travel to succour the distressed.
This will mightily encourage the impos-
tors in their trade, and engender a great
nuisance for tourists who are poorer or

You ask me if I love you,
And I cannot answer, “Yes!”
Tho' there's none I hold above you,
And my heart's in sore distress.
There are words one cannot utter,
And a “yes” is one of those ?
Yet it is not that I stutter,
Or speak slightly through the nose.
I can vow that I adore you,

But the lisp you've heard before, you

AN IDYLL.
In the month of January,
First I met my darling MARY.
In the month of fcbru-erry,
Then I met her down in Derry.
Once again in month of March,
Met her at tbe Marble Arch.
Met her in the month of April,
Gone to Bangor to escape Rbyl.
Met her once again in May,
Sitting calmly at the play.
Met her yet once more in June,
Where the Park-band plays a tune.
Then I met her in July,
Richmond Hill, and no one by.
Met her yet once more in August,
When it blew a nasty raw gust.
Did I meet her in September?
Did I ?-well, I don't remember.
Then I met her in October,
Spoke to her in sadness sober.
"No" comes natural in November,
Quenched was Cupid's flick'ring ember.
Never met again. December

invented a machine for sowing wild oats,
which is expected to have an immense

not a single specimen of a mare's nest.
This is a great disappointment to country

To PARENTS AND GUARDIANS. If you

JANCABY 8, 1870.]
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
AT THE RAILWAÏ STATION, ANTWERP, en route for Ais.—
Bather a crowd at the ticket place, and I come in at the tail.
My ear not having become accustomed to rapidly-spoken French
(by-the-way, I wonder how a Frenchman ever masters the names of
our stations as called out by the porters !) I am unable to grasp the
exact sum demanded of me for my ticket.
Happy Thought,—Put down a Napoleon, and see what change comes
out of it.
Clerk doesn't take it, but says something more rapidly in French.
Happy TAouohf.—S&j bien, and put down another Napoleon.
I am not able to count the change, owing to being pushed away by
an excited person behind, and led off, at once, by an intelligent porter
to get my luggage weighed, for which I hare to pay almost as much as
for myself.
I suddenly come upon DYNG WELL in a smoking carriage. We are
the only two—the Captain and myself—out of our original party, going
to Aix. He informs me that CHII.VEKN received some money this
morning from London. End of CHLLVEHN.
I make a point of asking the guard at every station, whether we
change here. Nothing like being certain. DYXG WELL wants to know
how long we wait at Liège. I advise him (knowing his peculiar
French) to ask the Guard. The result is that the Captain addresses
him thus: "Hi, Old Cockalorum, do we stop the waggon here, eh P"
Cockalorum returns some answer, and 1) YXG WELL asks me what he
said. I interpret it as, "We hardly stop here five minutes." The
result is, in point of fact, that we don't go on again for nearly half an
hour. After ten minutes DYNGWELL decides upon coing to the buffet.
He immediately asks for bitter beer loudly, and gets it at once. I can't
make up my mind whether it Vmore Continental to take coffee and a
cigarette, or tin ordinaire and some roast chicken. 1 have decided
upon the former, and am trying to attract a garçon, when DTMGWELL
says, * time 's up: the bulgine 's on again." Bulgine with him means
"Engine ;" but I somehow fancy that he imagines it to be French. I
remark that everyone (with the exception of such Cockalorums as the
Guard, who rather stands on the dignity of his uniform, I imagine)
understands the Captain's English, while they don't seem to get on
very well with my French. DTSGWELL notices this too.
Happy Thought.—To explain it to him thus, that these are Belgians,
and don't speak like les rrais Parisien». (When in Paris I can look
forward to saying that Belgium and Germany have spoilt my accent-
satisfactory.)
We cross the frontier, and suddenly hear nothing but German. Very
strange this at first. DTNGWELL thinks it would be a rum sort of a
start if one went from Kent to Sussex (from Tunbridge Wells to
Brighton, for instance) and didn't understand the language at Three
Bridges Station. DYNGWELL, I note, has more in him than meets
the eye.
Aix at last. When you get there it is called Aachen. DT»GWILL
explains this happily; he says a Frenchman expects to find Londres,
and it turns out to be London.
Examination of Baggage.—Questions in German: answer in dumb
show, like a pantomime. We have too much luggage for one trap, so
Captain goes on alone. He calls his coachman a Cockalorum, rand the
man touches .his hat. I feel somehow desolate: wish I hadn't come.
Everything looks dreary. I think of FRIDOLINE, and the baby with
the rash, and my mother-in-law at Brighton. Wish I'd gone with
them. But as I have come all this way to find out whether I 've got
latent rheumatic gout anywhere about me or not, I am determined to
go through the ordeal, whatever it may be. I am put into a fly—
such a machine! Three miles an hour, and an unwashed coachman
in a glazed hat. Destination, L'Batel du Grand Monarque. Sounds well.
First Observation in Note-Book.—Straiie means street. Mem. Will
learn German while here. We descend the broad Theater-Straste.
Happy TAottffU.—theti there 's a Theater here.
We pass a urge hotel—we pass a colonnade. More hotels—plenty
of people about: nearly all, apparently, English.
¿Second Observation.—That at the first .glance Aix has a highly re-
spectable appearance, but not gay.
The Hotel at last: courtyard as usual—very fine place. Like a
courtyard. I descend: a bell rings—sort of alarm of visitors. More
bells. Two porters, an under-waiter, a head-waiter (evidently, though
more like a Low-Church Curate in an open waistcoat), and in the dis-
tance on the stairs two chambermaids come out to receive me. Fore-
see donations to all these when I leave.
Happy Thought.—Commence in French (French carries you every-
where) /« désire une chambre au seconde, et
VOL. LVin.


## p. 2 (#26) ###############################################

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 8, 1870.
Immediate Reply of the low-Church Curate.—" Yes, Sir, if you '11
step up this way, I will show you." Very annoying. If you want to
speak another language than your own, merely for practice, they won't
let you.
The Head-Waiter insists upon my taking rooms on the first instead
of the second floor, as the season is just ending, and it will be all
the same. He leayes me, and enter tue Chambermaid. She smiles,
and addresses me in her own native tongue—German. She is asking
me, 1, imagine, from her thumping the bed and then putting a
question, whether 1 am going to bed now. Good gracious, it 's only
five o'clock.
Happy Thought,—Nein.
This I fancy sounds rough, so I soften it off with Merci. She is now
putting another question, this time with a jug in her hand. Evidently,
will I have some water. I distinguish the word vxuser.
Happy Thought.—Yah—taauax with a smile, 'Vil vous plaît." Another
question from her. Wasser again, but this time she mentions Hice-
wasser. Iced-Water? Nein, on no account, merci, thank you. But I
should like some—some—(I want to say warm water for my hands).
Why isn't there one universal language, say, English?
Happiest Thought,—To'say Warm'Wasser. She »intelligent, p'raps
she 's heard Englishmen try this before, for she replies laughing good-
naturedly (as if I had said something not quite proper, but which she
would look over as only attributable to my ignorance of the language)
"Farm-vaster."
Happy Thought.—" Oui, I mean yes, Yah, Farm-vasser." She
leaves me.
Note.—It 's a great thing to have the command of a language. Within
half an hour of my arrival I have mastered three words. Strosse is
street, ¡Passer is water, Warm is warm; and I establish one rule, that
"w" is pronounced like " y."
I recollect, when travelling a long time ago, that Takzo means a
good deal Try it presently, and watch the result.
After unpacking, go oat and examine the town. Although I've
never been nere in my life, I seem to have seen it all before, some-
where. Excellent shops: large restaurant. No out-of-door seats and
tables. Those who are not English are in uniform, at least so it seems
at first. Men in uniform are wheeling barrows, men in uniform are
driving carts, men in uniform are saluting superior uniforms with
epaulettes. To the English eye the town appears to be garrisoned by
our postmen. Becoming accustomed to them, you gradually pick out
the officers. Everybody is smoking, except the ladies, of course. The
toilettes here are not remarkable.
In tbe Theater-Strasse an enormous building is guarded by a very
small sentry. Think the building is a bank, or a post-office. He (the
small sentry) carries a big gun in a slouching way, and occasionally
stops to look at nothing in particular, with one hand in his pocket.
Servant-maids walk about like the Parisian grisettes in clean-looking
caps, generally carrying a basket, and an umbrella. Umbrellas are
popular. I meet a large sprinkling of the clerical element in
chimney-pot hats with narrow brims. The Don Basilio type is not
here. Sisters of Charity (also with baskets and umbrellas) m'plenty,
all looking particularly cheerful and happy. In the window of a book-
seller's shop I see a Manual of Conversation in Four Languages.
Happy Thought.—Buy it.
With this purchase I return to the Grand Monarque. The Head-
Waiter, who is'politeness itself, begs me to inscribe my name in a book.
I suppose DYNGWELL has been telling him about my writing Typical
Developments, and bringing out a work with POPGOOD AND GKOOLLY. I
1У I. will give him my autograph with pleasure.
It is in the List of Visitors.
I write it down. Head-Waiter smiles, "Ah," he says, "I know it
well." I am flattered. "Indeed?" 1 return, thinking of DYNGWELL.
It 's rather nice of DYNGWELL if he has done this; I really did not
imagine he had such an appreciation of literature. "Yes," the
Head-Waiter continues, with his peculiar accent, "I remember him
well in London, in 'Olborn. Name well known. I am glad to see
you here, Sir."
I don't live in Holbom, and I never had any association with the
place. Is it possible that my intention of publishing has got about,
and that even this waiter No, it can't be. He goes on to explain.
I find that he has mistaken the spelling, and has confounded me
(confound him!) with a Large Cheap Tailor's Establishment. An-
noying, but lucky I discover it in time.
A Dove in Duck's Plumage.
THE Continental papers call the hoax asserting that France had
proposed a general disarmament of the European Powers, the "dis-
armament canard." Should not canard be colombe?
TUB BEST NOTE PAPER.—Bank of England.
CHRISTMAS KEEPING AND CHRISTMAS
BREAKING.
"The whole of Tuesday was occupied at the different Police Courts in
investigating the usual ' drunk and disorderly1 charge! arising out of Christmas
and Boxing-Bay festivities."—Neujspaptr paragraph, kept stereotyped.
"CHJUSTMAS comes but once a year,"
So by all means let us be jolly,
Over turkey and beef and plum-pudding,
Mince-pies, mistletoe, and holly,
Poor relations and family dinners,
And schoolboys' holiday folly.
Let 's indulge our children with Pantomimes-
Till common sense destroy them—
Christmas sweetmeats and Christmas sentiment,—
In the hope that neither may cloy them:
Christmas bills, and Christmas boxes,
Let 's endure, if we can't enjoy them.
But oh, Pater and Hater Familia»—
Above all, P. and M. of " the masses,"—
Whom to flatter sky-high Southwark candidates vie,—
Not "working," but "lower" classes!
Say, why at thia season your boasted reason
Into swinish un-reason passes?
In the name of Modern Enlightenment,
Franchise, and Education,
Oh, broad-spread base of the pyramid,
Oh, brawn and thews of the nation,
Why( on Tuesday after Boxing-Day,
This flood of intoxication P
Can it be that the Slough of Despond
Not narrowed, but broader and broader lies,
Where tbe angel that livee with the brute in us,
On the wrong side the brute's border lies,
That, last Tuesday's English Police Courts
Were gorged with 'Drunk and disorderlies '?
Shall Punch smooth down the working-men
With the soft-soap of hustings' hypocrisy P
Shall he hail them as the ideal
Of Pare and Progressive Democracy P
The best model and example
For a 'Bloated Aristocracy'?
No—he positively can't do it,
I» the face of the facts about him:
With their Christmas carols still ringing
In Police charge-sheets to flaut him;
If he did, they 'd be the first,
They know they would, to scout him.
We ought all to be ashamed of ourselves,
High and low, and gentle and simple:
While the face of our civilisation
Is foul with grog-blossom and pimple,
And our Christmas cheer is a curse and a leer,
Instead of a prayer and a dimple.
OUR GROWING METROPOLIS.
MEN who live in London are often heard complaining of the labour
;hat they have to bear when paying country visits. What is called
"County Society" is in very many cases so scattered and remote, that
one must drive a dozen miles or so to meet a dozen people, and the
chance is, after all, that one has a dismal dinner. But in London even
something of the same kind is experienced, and we easily may pro-
mesy, by looking at this estimate, how much in half a century the
ж ¡sinn: will increase :—
"It is assumed that in thirty-nine years hence nearly fifty square miles of
now open country about the Aletropolis will be covered with houses for the
accommodation of the then population."
Besides the trouble and annoyance of visiting one's friends when
hey choose to live in suburbs about fifty miles away from one, there
s the added nuisance foreshadowed by this estimate that in a few years
lence no Londoner can dream of taking country exercise, or of getting
air to breathe which will be anything like fresh. At present there are
walks within a reasonable distance, through fields and lanes which are
iot blackened yet by smoke. But in a score or so of years one will
lave to travel a score or so of miles before one will be able to look at a
green hedge. Houses, houses everywhere will be then the rule, and
iot a spot to walk on except the noisy streets.

SEASONABLE WEATHER.
CHRISTMAS APPEALS!

ITH '' Seasonable" weather
Old Father Christmas starts.
If the frost that hardens roadways,
But help to soften hearts:
If the chill, that gives a relish
To rich folk's warmth and cheer,
Reminds of those who 've neither
Clothes nor coals, beef nor beer:
If the wind to wealth that whistles,
"Enjoy furs, food, and flame,"
Whistle, by way of burden,
"And help Want to do the same :"
,t- If the frosty glow that tingles
-I III From finger-top to nose,
Й Light the heart's central fire
That in kindly action glows:
Then the bitterer the frost-bite,
And the hoarier the rime,
The more seasonable weather
For the blessed Christmas time.
For the more it asks fulfilment
Of the law embodied then,
In the Saviour's "Peace on earth,
And goodwill towards men."
THE RAILWAY BLOCKHEAD
SYSTEM.
UNDER the appropriate heading of " Rail-
way Intelligence," we see it announced that—
"The Midland Railway will in future be
worked on the block system."
The block svstem ensures well nigh perfect
safety from collisions, and is therefore vastly
preferable to the stupid blockhead system
which upon most railways has hitherto pre-
vailed. The blockhead system has consisted
in cutting down expenses to the very lowest
point, and trusting to good fortune for esca-
ping from bad accidents. The signals most
m vogue nppn the blockhead system have
been signal inefficiency and signal want of
common sense. Guards and drivers have
been overworked, and pointsmen tired to
death, and then accidents have happened
and heavy damages have been paid. False
economy has been the rule upon the block-
head system, and good dividends the excep-
tion, it the accounts have not been cooked.
Montaigne and Ultra-Montane.
MONTAIGNE'S Essays have often had the
honour of translation, and now Ultra-Mon-
tane's essays are about to receive the same
honour, by the translation of ARCHBISHOP
M Assise;—to the Cardinakte.
CRAMMING AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL.
MR. Рхгясн,
THE Christmas Holidays may be described, not untruly, as a
season of cramming. The season of cramming it cannot so truly be
called, because there are other seasons of cramming. The school-days
each "half," are seasons of cramming equally with the Christmas
Holidays. Only, whereas the latter constitute a season of cramming
for the stomach, the former are seasons in which the mind is wont to
be crammed.
The effects of cramming the stomach, Sir, are bad enough; but the
stomach, Mr. Punch, can, in a measure, take care of itself. It can put
in force an Alien Act, provided by Nature: for the expulsion of
matters which affect it in the relation of hostile foreign bodies. But
the mind is unable to deal with undigested and indigestible facts as
the stomach deals with greasy plum-pudding, mince-pies, twelfth-cake,
and the rest of all the unwholesome varieties of Christmas fare. It
may fail, indeed, to retain them, but it does not, in rejecting them,
expel their effects. For you cram the mind through the brain, and in
so doing overwork the brain. Pardon me, Sir. Not you. They—the
crammers.
Moreover, the youthful stomach, if not too young, will stand much
more cramming, in proportion, than the brain which it recruits with
nourishment. A full-grown school-boy will eat more with impunity,
for the present at least, than your friend. MR. ALDERMAN, who is over-
grown. But the boy's brain is in a less finished state than his stomach;
is not yet developed: is tender, irritable, unequal to hard work.
Accordingly, Mr. Punch, you have seen it stated, on good authority,
that "one, at least, of the candidates at the last examination at Wool-
wich has been prostrated by a brain fever," and that another has died
since the examination commenced, his death having been probably
"accelerated, if not indirectly caused, by the severe-mental strain which
he had undergone in cramming up for the. numerous subjects it has
been thought necessary for candidates to get up." For a sprained
ankle or strained muscles there are opodeldoc and arnica, Sir; but
what liniment or lotion can you or any other Physician prescribe for a
mental strain £. Blue-pill and black reviver, and so forth, may remedy
the effects of a surfeit; but "what rhubarb, senna, or what" similar
"drug" (as a reader of SHAKSPEAÄE would say to a nice audience)
will cure brain fever brought on by repletion of the mind?
By the way, SHAKBPEARE was never crammed. MILTON was never
crammed. BACON, NEWTON, DAVY, FARADAY, were never crammed.
You were never crammed, Sir. What great poet or philosopher have
we that has been crammed P Are we likely to have one when everybody
shall have been crammed? And is it not credible that some of the
greatest men the world has ever known, would have been plucked if
they had had to pass a competitive examination? Then, Mr. Punch,
the world would have known still less of its greatest men than the little
which, as you know, it knows now.
Tell Education-Councillors and Committee-men, Sir, that it may be
worth their while to consider whether genius or mediocrity would be
likely to gain the greater number of marks by answering the kind of
questions proposed by ordinary examiners? Also whether high powers
of thought are not absolutely unfavourable to that exertion of the
merely acquisitive memory imposed by the cramming system. But 1
must not cram your attention with philosophy which you need not to
be taught; and whereof, especially in the presence of the pantomimes,
a little goes a great way with many people who mostly do not think
like you, Mr. Punch, and perhaps think even less than your humble
correspondent, EARLSWOOD.
P.S. Many Happy New Years.
MORE NEW THEATRES!
OLD fogies often talk of the decline of the drama, and say thc.i;
nobody cares nowadays to spend an evening at the theatre. But
somebody must entertain a different opinion, or we should not find
put forward such intelligence as this :—
"NEW THEATRES.—In addition to the theatre now building in the Strand,
we hear the Coliseum will be opened as an opera, and bo connected with the
Metropolitan Kailway. A theatre and winter-garden will shortly be con-
structed on the site of Savile House, and we believe that a new theatre is in
progress of erection in Sloane Square, to meet the wants dramatic of the
playgoers in Belgravia."
There are over thirty theatres open now in London, and over forty
music-halls where performers, of some sort, come nightly on the stage.
Yet Belgravia " wants" a theatre, at least so we are informed, and
Leicester Square another, at least so we may infer that the designer
doubtless thinks. Well, the more the merrier—at any rate we will
hope so. But as for this place or the other "wanting" a new play-
house, convenient to itself, we fear such multiplication may prove to
be vexation, not merely to the managers but the playgoers as well.
Centralise your actors, and you get your plays well acted, and your
theatres will pay: but if you scatter them about in Brixton and
Belgravia, in Kensington and Kennington, in Hampstead and in
Houndsditch, your stars will be dispersed, and haply cease to shine,
and your taste for things theatrical will daily grow debased.
The Right Man in the Right Place.
THE Secretary-General of the (Ecumenical Council is MONSIGNOR
FESSLER. The name is German, derived from "fesseln," and means
"one who puts on fetters."
AQUATICS.—Neither the Thames, nor the Cam, nor the Isis, is the
proper river for a "scratch" crew—but the Itchen.

PREDICTIONS FOR 1870.
THERE will be the usual number of seasons, fire—Spring, Sammer,
Autumn, Winter, and the London; and probably an extra one at the
Opera.
Peace will be generally maintained, bat there will be engagements in
all quarters of the world.'
The QUEEN'S Speech will contain some queer Queen's English.
The Irish Land Question will either be settled or fall to the ground.
l)n. TEMPLE will torn oat the best Bishop they 'те ever had in the
West.
Any theatre having a successful piece, will do well in the long run.
The ESIPEKOB or THE FKENCH will пате a new set of studs and a
new set of ministers.
Oysters will be sixpence a piece, and the natives in New Zealand
troublesome.
MACAULAY'S New Zealapder, MOLIÈRE'S Frenchman who had been
talking prose all his life without knowing it, SIDNEY SMITH'S bishop
who huts yet to be roasted alive in a railway carriage, MBS. GRUMDY,
MBS. PABTINGTON, with her mop, the British Lion and Constitution,
and other old friends, will be all about again and get into the papers.
The camp at Wimbledon will be bigger than ever, the cattle at the
Cattle Show fatter than ever, the streets of London dirtier than ever,
the Christmas pantomimes more gorgeous than ever, the feminine
fashions more wonderful than ever, the Boat Race, the Derby, and the
Royal Academy, more crowded than етег, the girls prettier than ever—
and Mr. Punch wittier than ever.
The Vatican and Fleet Street.
SEVERAL Correspondents have written to ask what " The Congrega-
tion of the Index," is which they have lately seen mentioned in the

SUPERFLUOUS COMMISSIONS.
WE read that the Fathers of the Council have been called upon to
elect four Commissioners to deal with questions of—
1st. Dogma.
2nd. Discipline.
3rd. The Regular Orders.
4th. Oriental Rites.
What can the Council want with Commissioners to deal with these
questions, seeing that as to—
1st. Dogma, there can be no question, inasmuch as there is but one
dogma to be insisted upon which includes all others—Infallibility.
2nd. As to Discipline. There can be no question about this, see-
ing that the discipline required need but be the strictest possible to
ensure that no members of the Council claims or exercises a will of
his own.
3rd. The Regular Orders. There can be no question about this—
so long as the only regular orders for the members of the Council
are, to open their ears and shut their eyes, and take what the POPE
shall send them.
4th. Oriental Rites.—There can be no question about thit, inasmuch
as in presence of the POPS, there are, tor all other members of the
Council, or the Church, no Oriental rights, or Occidental rights either.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CLERGYMAN WHO KEEPS A CONSCIENCE.
A GOOD example has been set to Ritualists and other Dissenters
holding the position of clergymen in the Church of England, by the
late Public Orator at Cambridge, MR. W. CLARK. In a letter addressed
to the BISHOP or ELY, MB. CLARK announces his wish to relinquish
the position which those other clergymen persist in keeping. Assigning
his reason for taking that step he says :—
"Slowly and reluctantly I bare been driven to conclusions incompatible
with the declarations which I made at my ordination."
He then proceeds to specify these conclusions. They may briefly be
said to be what are commonly called Broad Church views, and, if in-
compatible with certain articles and formularies, are not contradictory
to any point of Protestant Churchmanship. It would be quite possible
for MR. CLARK to hold office as a Churchman without being, like the
apes of Homanism, a traitor in the camp; but his conscience will not
let him occupy the place of a teacher subscribing to propositions in a
non-natural sense, that is to say, lying. Neither do MR. CLARK'S
opinions oblige him to secede from the Church, he only proposes to
retire from its ministry; and accordingly he tells the Bishop :—
"Under these circumstances I beg to signify to you my desire to relinquish
the position of a clergyman, and resume that of a layman. Whatever law,
written or unwritten, may prevent me from doing this, I protest against it as
iniquitous and immoral, because it conflicts with the natural rights and
bounden duty of every man, all his life long, to search for and proclaim the
truth."
"Once a parson always a parson" is a rule which would be very
much more honoured in the repeal than in the maintenance. Surely
MR. GLADSTONE, full as his hands may be of Irish affairs, could con-
trive to manage that little matter of its repeal in the coming session,
by passing a suitable measure under the title, say, of a Clerical Relief
Act. A law is wanted to empower any clergyman who pleases to turn
layman, in so far as the ability to exercise any secular calling, that he
may wish to adopt, is concerned. For a conscientious Rationalist such
an enactment would be a great convenience; as regards a conscientious
Ritualist or Puaeyite, if there is one, it would be a most desirable
arrangement. It would enable him to turn at once both layman and
Papist; thus constituting a bridge of gold for a flying enemy.
PEOPOSED WIDENING OF THE OLD JUEY.
MR. PUNCH—SIR,
OUR Saxon ancestors by a sharp struggle succeeded in. getting
twelve men into a box, and there it stands in its juridical simplicity
at the summit of Constitution Hill. It was, however, certain severe
and litigious ladies of modern times who put a patent lock on the panel,
and kept the council of twelve in durance for as many consecutive days.
Beanty scorns to look at Time with his ugly scythe and sand-glass.
The long detention was signalised by a great clashing of convent-
belles.
Sir, I am a simple lover of Justice. As such I ask why should the
inevitable twelve be always, so to speak, pressed men P Now that
lovely woman has entered on the rough path of pathology, why not
prolong her walk to the Temple of Themis '( Why should merchants
and bankers, who form a special jury, alone be summoned to survey
desolated hearts, and furnish estimates for general repairs? When
tender promises are alleged to have been broken, who so competent to
assess the damage done, as those who keep watch and ward over our
vases, and whose memories are as familiar with withered hopes aa their
little scissors with blighted blossoms?
In answer to these arguments it may be urged "that such very'special
juries as I recommend, could not possibly remain silent for an hour—
pooh-pooh, nonsense !—let them try. If they fail—they fail.
A more serious objection is, that their vigilant eyes might be dazzled
by the waving of a white forensic hand, and evidence be less regarded
than the aggressive whiskers of a silk gown or the insidious moustache
of a si u II' one.
To prevent undue influence of this kind, my old friend FOGLETON (a
most clubable man) suggests an extensive screen, against which I fear
there would be a loud cry by the fair advocates of non-intervention.
It would be better, I think, to leave a question of this delicate nature
to the honourable feeling of the Bar, which, after all, is not so black
as generally painted. Leaders and juniors should proudly resolve to
rely entirely on their wigs, and discard every other curl, natural or
acquired.
I would also strongly advise in actions for non-performance of
marriage, that any member of a very special jury accepting an offer
from a successful defendant within three months after verdict given,
should be punished for contempt of court. Ттт„,„ „ „

THE THREE R'S.
To ike Lord» Spiritual and Temporal and Commoiu when in Parliament
assembled.
The Humble Petition of the Three R's
Showeth—
Thmt your Petitioners have for many years carried on business as
manufacturers of knowledge-boxes.
That your Petitioners are informed "and believe that it is proposed
to open a new road and level the approaches to their factory; also to
remove certain fences which have hitherto obstructed the main
thoroughfare, and that competent surveyors have examined the ground
and agreed upon a report, after long and due deliberation.
That such proposed new road will, as your Petitioners are informed
and believe, divert the traffic from the narrow lanes leading to the
Parochial Union and the County House of Correction, and sensibly
diminish the highway rates in connection therewith.
That your Petitioners1 have heard with sorrow and surprise that their
respectable and old-established Firm has been charged with contem-
plating the manufacture of Lucifer Matches, and the employment of
clever little imps in dipping and sorting combustible splints.
That your Petitioners have no intention or desire to fill their know-
ledge-boxes with any dangerous compounds, and the accusation of
wishing to set either the Tower or the Thames on fire they indignantly
rebut.
Your Petitioners therefore humbly submit, that active steps should
be taken to provide for the public accommodation as above proposed;
and further, that the knowledge-boxes of the Three R's should be
officially recognised, and by virtue of their innocence and utility, be
honoured with the Government stamp.
And your Petitioners will ever pray.
WALKER'S ROMAN ANTIQUITIES.
ACCORDING to the Pall Mall Gazette :—
"The EMPRESS OP AUSTRIA is showing great interest in the antiquities and
public buildings of Rome. After seeing the Vatican she went to the Lateran,
where ehe was received at the door by the Chapter and conducted over the
Cathedral. There was an express exhibition of the relics of St. Peter and St.
Paul, and Her Majesty inspected the Scala Santa."
There is a kind of exercises called devotional, as everybody knows.
By devotional exercises most people understand readings, méditations,
orisons, and suchlike acts essentially and chiefly of a mental character.
There are, however, devotional exercises other than these. Certain
Dervishes dance by way of devotion. Indian Fakirs, and penitents or
vice-penitents swing themselves on hooks, and practise other arduous
and painful gymnastics. Fakirs of a different persuasion sometimes
climb the Scala Santa at Rome on their knees. The EMPRESS OF
AUSTRIA only "inspected" it. Perhaps its inspection satisfied her
Majesty. Let us hope that, in inspecting the Scala Santa, she was
not, as Alpine Clubmen say when surveying the mountain they pro-
pose to ascend, "looking at her work."
In climbing the Scala Santa anyone might sing "Excelsior!" and
perhaps be considered as singiug pretty fairly in the "accustomed
ecclesiastical Latin "—if not exactly in the Virgilian or Horatiao, May
the EMPRESS OP AUSTRIA have more sense than to put herself in the
way to sing "Excelsior" up the Scala Santa! Then, should her
Majesty shortly visit this country for a change, no vulgar Briton will
have any excuse for asking her "How 's your poor knees?"
The Pall Mall's correspondent adds :—
"The EMPRESS has also visited the Coliseum, St. Pietro a Vineolo, the
monuments of the Appiau Way, and St. Mary Maggiore, where she saw the
manger of Bethlehem."
As really and truly, no doubt, we are of course meant to understand,
as she saw the bones, nail-parings, rags and tatters, chains, or what
other assortment of objects soever may be comprised in the " express
exhibition of the relics of St. Peter and St. Paul."
From the Boyal Laboratory.
CERTAIN persons, SIR JOHN PAKINGTON for example, may or may
not have had a Christmas Box—on that point we possess no trust-
worthy information—but they certainly have_ had what cannot be the
most agreeable accompaniment of the festive season—a Christmas
BOXER.
BURDEN OÏ AN ITALIAN SONG.

da se?" If Italia does not contrive soon to get a respectable Govern-
ment, it will be Italia farà la la! or in plain English, Italy fiddle-
de-dee!

COMPLETELY t
"WASNT THAT A DAINTY DISH TO SET BEFORE A KING F"
THE French EMPEROR having expressed a desire to test some of the Australian
meat, •which furnishes the penny-dinners in Norton F óigate, MB. TALLERMAN,
Manager of the Australian Meat Agency, at once submitted samples to the
Tuileries. The EHPEROB, on the principle offiat expérimentant in corpore vili, caused
some of the meat to be cooked for the soldiers on guard. Finding that they sur-
vived it, and even, like Oliver Twist, asked for more, he ordered the same dish to
be set before the principal officers of the Imperial Household. The officers, unlike
the privates, shuddered, but eat, and, to their own amazement, relished; and then
the EMPKROR tried it himself, pronounced it good, and expressed his gracious
intention of causing a more extended trial to be maxie—we presume on the EM-
PRESS and the entourage.
The verdict of the French private soldier can hardly be regarded as conclusive.
He is capable of converting by his so potent art, not only cats, but "rats and mice,
and such small deer," to the purposes of the <!amelle. But the Officers of the
Household are used to very different fare, and where they ventured, even gourmets
need not fear to follow. Above all, the EMVEROII has eaten and approved. No
wonder that MR. TALLER м A N the Manager has been a Taller man ever since by
several inches, 'and that the Australian Meat 'Agency is looking up, from the
humility of artizan penny dinners in Norton Folgate to the sublimity of Imperial
banquets at the Tuileries. But, after all, it is the many " littles " that will make
the "mickle ;" and in this case penny-wisdom, if the dinners only, spread wide
enough, will be anything but pound-foolishness.
MEDICAL POLICE.
SEVERAL cases have lately occurred wherein the police have removed to the
Station-house persons whom they ought to have conveyed t o_ the Hospital They
have picked up people lying unconscious in the street, and mistaken for drunk and
incapable those who were really apoplectic and insensible. At this season of
extraordinary conviviality mistakes of that kind are likely to be made in aug-
mented number, since the enjoyments which cause a state of intoxication are abo
very often the causes which occasion a state of coma. What a pity it is that
medical knowledge is not generally blended with a constable's authority! It
might, and very likely would be, if a step were taken by the Government which
would involve only a trifling addition to the expense of the
police force. Anybody who considers how many more men
enter the medical profession than the number it is capable
of supporting, will see that there must be many of its
members who would be glad to undertake any employment
by which they could earn the living ordinarily got by a
moderately skilled workman. It may reasonably be ex-
pected that a small addition to the policeman's pay would
induce many'of those unemployed medical gentlemen to
become candidates for the office of guardian and preserver
of the public. In that case it is obvious that there would
ensue a considerable diminution of those deplorable mis-
takes which arise solely from policemen's unacquaintance
with diagnosis.

Write that fellow down a fool.
Drink we Love, for it conduces
Matrimony to extend.

In relation to that end.
Here 's a health to linendrapers,
Silks and satins who purvey.
Prosper fashion-books and papers,
With designs of smart array.
Here 's to milliners inventive,
Fabricating Beauty's arms,
Ministers of aids incentive
Which embellish native charms.
Here's to jewellers, who garnish
Damsels fair with witching things,
Gems, and gold that doth not tarnish,
They make, bless them, wedding-rings.
Here 's to all who lovely features,
Form, and grace, by art enhance,
Hairdressers, perfumers, teachers
Of deportment and the dance.
Here 's to novelist and poet;
Cupid's flame their writings fan.
Here s to playwrights; they too, blow it
Up, like bellows, all they can.
Here 's to soft inspired musicians
In whose works fond passion glows,
Forming one of those conditions
Which to nuptials predispose.
Here 's to young men sentimental,
Who have pluck to take a wife,
Braving small cares, incidental,
Slightly, to domestic life:
Delicate organisation.
Asking, oft, remedial aid,
Teething, measles, vaccination,
With expenses to be paid.
Drink the wooers, and the willing
To be won by them that woo.
Drink we cooing, drink we billing;
And may Christmas bills ensue.
Many a fellow, single, never
Has to pay a doctor's bill;
Early marriage, then, for ever:
And success to Practice still.

FASHIONABLE ECONOMY.
HRISTMAS bills are coming
in, and fathers of large fami
lies who are screwing tip
their courage to meet them,
may find some consolation in
the following intelligence:—
"Of fashions there is little to
gay: in fact, there hare been
but very few changea since lut
winter. As a rule, the dresses
made then serre тегу well for
the present seaion."
Happy the man whose wile
and daughters take this hint
to heart, and are sensibly
content to wear their last
year's dresses! Such an act
of heroism—or let us say of
sheroism—must likewise be
an act of very seasonable be-
neyolence. Poor Papa is
dailv trembling now at every
double knock, for with everv
post there pours in a large shower of " little accounts," with which
bis tradesfolk send their compliments; while every single knock goes
through him like a knife, while he is fearfully awaiting the visit of the
tax-gatherer. Therefore, О ye wives and daughters, do have pity on
Papa, and please him by appearing in the dresses of last winter. Pay
no need to what you fancy will be said by MBS. GRUND Y, or any other
snobbess. To live out of debt is better t han to live dressed in the fashion,
and so long as your old clothes are said to " serve very well," don't be
in a hurry to discharge such good old servants.

NEW CUEIOSrriES OF LITEEATUKE.
PORSOK and WILTTERFORCE devoted considerably more than a fort-
night to amassing materials for a biography of those inseparable com-
panions, HUME and SMOLLETT; but ш the great fire which raged in
London, in the back shop of MESSRS. BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, on
Constitution Hill, the Mb. which was closely written on a series of
envelopes turned inside out, amounting to at many as four, was unfor-
tunately entirely destroyed before assistance could be procured from
the nearest drinking fountain. It was intended to illustrate the lives
of these joint authors with (pewter) plates by the Beef-steak Club; and
the whole work would have been issued m triennial parts from the
Oxford Press, under the superintendence of the learned BISHOP BULL.
FOOTE wrote The Traveller in a stage-coach, and afterwards, as a
sequel, The Rambler in post haste, to defray the expenses of his wooden
leg. GAT was the author;of The Grave, and DAY. when he retired
from the firm of DAY AND MARTIN, occupied himself with the compo-
sition of his Night Thoughts. The erudite WHITBY planned his Trip
to Scarborough on the Yorkshire coast, and subsequently induced the
EARL or BURLINGTON to set it to music, to commemorate the inaugu-
ration of the Arcade by the original Christy Minstrels. JOHN HUNTER,
during a dead calm, completed at least six-sevenths of the Anatomy of
Melancholy in his cutter, with the valuable help of " slashing BENTLEY.
The author of Junita was SAVAGE.
BEN JONSON meant to have dedicated his Dictionary tojthe EARL OP
CHESTERFIELD—the courtly nobleman who invented a soup, an over-
coat, and politeness—but Fox's Book of Martyrs to the Qout, compiled
from personal reminiscences, having got the start of CURRAN on the
Currency, HENRY FLOOD (familiarly known, on account of his oratory,
as a flood of eloquence), and LORB HEEVBY, who wrote the Meditations
amongst the Tome» in the British Mmeum, the sale of which did not in
the least affect the circulation of the blood, insisted on DRUMIIOND (of

FRIGHTFUL CLERICAL SCANDAL!
AN Incumbent, who hails from the "Post Office, Uxbridge," in
advertising for a Curate in the Guardian, takes the opportunity of
administering a merited castigation to a proverbially overpaid and
under-worked body of men. He describes himself аз ' somewhat tired
of clergymen whose letters convey the impression (doubtless often
erroneous) that their main object is a 'post' combining a mini mum
of labour with a maximum of comfort," and adds that he "would be
thankful to hear of an ASSISTANT-FAUST, desiring to give himself in
body, soul and spirit, £e."—to quote further would be profane.
Is it possible r "Only a Curate," and yet expecting a "maximum
qfoomfcrt!" Can it be that the "inferior clergy" are beginning,
like their ecclesiastical superiors to hear "a Voice" (with a capital
V) caljing them to exchange £50 a-year for £70, as well as £5000 for
£7000? What is the use of Twelve Day»' Missions, Convocation, and
(Ecumenical Councils, if such anarchy as this is to prevail P And yet
see how tenderly our reverend advertiser twits his dilettante bret.hren.
He is only "somewhat" tired of them—not very—long-suffering
martyr!
The impression produced by their letters that they are seeking a
"maximum of comfort," is "doubtless often erroneous." When such
saponaceous reservations qualify the else severe towelling, can we not
fancy that crowds of eager competitors will rush to all/ themselves
with so thoroughly sympathetic a superior "Priest?" Let us wish
all the joy he can possibly anticipate to the fortunate candidate who shall
succeed to the 'post" so properly-and politely offered at the "Post"
Office, Uxbridge.

AMENDS TO AMERICA.
THE long and short of 'the sea-serpentine despatch of MR. FISH
touching the Alabama claims is simply this, that the Americans com-
plain, not that we were not neutral in their civil war, but that we were.
It is now clear how we may satisfy them. We should, no doubt, do it
by making them a national apology for our neglect to espouse the side
of the North with active sympathy, by taking measures to prevent our
merchantmen from breaking the blockade of the Southern ports, by
sending out cruisers to capture the Southern privateers, and by seizing
and handing over to the Federal Government all the Confederate
vessels that came to our ports. In addition to owning up all this, it
would only'be necessary to offer to pay any amount of damages at
which the United States Government might assess the losses inflicted
upon American Commerce by the Alabama, or any other Confederate
man-of-war that we failed to take or destroy. Early in the approaching
Session, if the Government should not, some independent Member of
the Legislature perhaps will, move a Resolution to the effect above
stated, in the House of Commons.

THE VALUE OF "PROPUTTY."
THE celebrated LORD CHESTERFIELD, clever as he may have been in some
respects, was obtuse in others. He had not the sense to appreciate the pith of
oar good old proverbs, and instructed bis son, whose stupidity needed no enhance-
ment, that they were vulgar. He would bave turned his finicking nose up at the
wise and venerable saying, that one man may steal a horse whilst another must
not look over a hedge. This, indeed, is now seldom quoted, having fallen into
disuse since horse-stealing was made no longer a hanging matter. Horse-stealing
is still, however, punishable with a degree of comparative severity quite sufficient
to render that adage about it intelligible.
At the Middlesex Sessions, the other day, THOMAS EVANS, aged 38, pleaded guilty
to stealing a horse, value £5. He was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude.
On the previous day another thief, who had pleaded not guilty, ELIZABETH BARRY,
aged 39, was adjudged, at the Berkshire Epiphany Quarter Sessions, to fifteen
calendar months' imprisonment with hard labour. The difference between these
two thieves was essentially this. THOMAS EVANS had stolen a horse; ELIZABETH
BARRY had stolen a child. To be sore, the man was proved to be an habitual
criminal; but then, oublie other hand, the woman was a nurse in the service of the
gentleman whose child she stole. Thus she was guilty of robbing her employer,
and she robbed him of an object which he valued indefinitely more than he could
have prized any horse: moreover she had, according to evidence, ill-used the child,
and all this with malice prepense. And she was liable to seven years' penal ser-
vitude too. But the child could not be assessed at the specific value of £5, and
the horse could. To that difference between the two cases corresponded the
difference between the sentences of fifteen months' imprisonment with hard
labour, and seven years' penal servitude. So the dear old proverb which implies
the relative atrocity of horse-stealing is no anachronism. For your horse is that
thing to the sound of whose name ne canters, as TENNYSON'S Northern Farmer
says, "Propntty, Propntty, Proputty," marketable "proputty," and your child
isn't. Judges and Justices think more of " proputty" than even what it is thought
of by the Northern Farmer.

WHO 's that knocking at the door?
'Tis I, says ROBERT LOTVE,
With the bill of what you owe,
For house and for assessed tax,
And income-tax, that best tax—
'Tis so charmingly elastic,
So pliant and so plastic,
And falls upon so many;
'Tis a million to the penny—
Then inspection 1 invite
That your licences are right—
For keeping, if you can,
Dogs and arms, and trap and man,
So no wonder I am knocking at the door.
There used be two knockings at the door:
In April and September,
As you probably remember,
The collector used to sack,
For Lord knows how far back—
For traps that you had dropped
Arms on plate that yon had popped,
Dogs that had cut and run,
And flunkeys that had gone,
For which to your disgust,
Charge they did, and pay you must—
And if you didn't kick
The man out pretty quick,
You felt you 'd like to do it,
If at law you 'd not to rue it.
In the aggravating day—
Now happily past away—
When they knocked twice at the door!
Now, when /knock at the door,
Tis on licence, where, contest,
Stand dogs, arms, traps, and the rest;
For your income-tax and eke
Your house-tax 1 've to seek,
And from the New Year's day
Rates and taxes beg you '11 pay,
111'accents bland and winning,
For the year that is beginning.
And yon must feel, if one axes
For assessed and income taxes,
'Tis impossible to do so
In a way that should suit you so,
While it certainly suits me,
And Her Majesty's Treasune—
And that 's how ./ knock at the door.
True, this year there 's rather more
To pay than may be pleasant
In bad times like the present:
For this year I must combine
Taxes for 1, 8, 6, 9—
With the licences you've bought
For 1, 8, 7, 0.
Which certainly appears
Like paying for two years
And is what it doth appear—
But it 's only for this year:
And you will not be so done
In 1, 8, 7, 1.
For then we shall be straight—
The year's back with the year's weight—
And you will not have to pay
Two years' taxes in one day—
When next year I come knocking at the door.
Death "Sans Phrase."
TROPMANN, the Pantin murderer, has been thought, even
by a French jury, too bad to admit of " extenuating circum-
stances" in their verdict. This settles his place in the annals
of murder. Even his advocate could find no better defence
for him, than that he was too bad to behead—and ought
to be shut up, as we shut up tigers, in a cage out of
harm's way to others. He is not too much of man, but too
little of man—being evidently a brute^and a dangerous
brute too—one to be " stamped out " of Ufe, as mad dogs are.

NEW CUEIOSITIES OF LITEKATUEE.
THE loves of eminent men have often been romantic and remarkable. DR. BUSBY'S early
passion for the lady who afterwards became MRS. TRIMMER, and by whom he was refused
three times— in a travelling menagerie, at MADAME TUSSAUD'S, and in BIRCH'S shop on Cornhill—
was never mastered. He always remained in bed on the anniversary of her wedding-day, eating
nothing but stewed prunes and charcoal biscuits, and reading all the letters he had received
from the lady, which he kept at his banker's during the rest of the year in an old pocket-book
given him by GRAINGER, who wrote The Sugar Cane.
PALET was constantly in love, and as often, with an excess of fastidiousness, discovering
some imperfection which deterred him from proposing marriage. One lady sneezed three times
in three minutes; another looked too stout on horseback; a third horrified him by partaking
twice of liver and bacon; a fourth could not tell what Caviare was; and a fifth, who really
thought she had hooked the Archdeacon, lost him by his coming in unexpectedly from one of
his fishing excursions, and finding her sucking a large-sized orange.
Unmolested by the mounted patrol, WALLER carved SaccAarissa's name, by moonlight, on
the Maypole in the centre of Paddington Green (with the clasp-knife which she had given
him when they parted forever in the brewhouse at Penshurst) the night before he emigrated
to Sydney, where he took a sheep-walk, and wrote some of the most beautiful of his pastoral
poems, prior to his marriage with the wealthy widow of я retired sugar-baker, who had been!
knighted by the King for raising a troop of
horse in the heat of summer.
OLIVER CROMWELL'S first love was a little
milliner's apprentice at Huntingdon. He
certainly would have married this young girl,
and become her Protector for life, had not
his friends sent him away to Saffron Waiden
to be with a vintner there, in whose esta-
blishment he imbibed those republican
opinions which afterwards led him to make
short work of the Long Parliament, and to
bury the Mace and the Great Seal, by torch-
light, in the Tower Ditch, the celebrated
GUIDO FAWKES holding the lantern (with
matches warranted to light only on the box),
and SIR CLOUDESLKY SHOVEL handling the
spade.
It is a natural and pardonable curiosity
that seeks to know what have been the fa-
vourite viands of those we reverence and
admire. LORD CHESTERFIELD supped every
Saturday night, on tripe and onions, with
CAPTAIN CORAM and GAINSBOROUGH, at the
"Blue Boy " in Leather Lane, then a fashion-
able part of Town, and inhabited by the
learned KIDD, the Ambassador from Mo-
rocco, &c.
GEORGE TUE THIRD preferred Windsor
Beans to any other vegetable; QUEEN ELIZA-
BETH doated on Spanish onions: MARTIN
LUTHER and JOHN KNOX were alike in their
fondness for the Pope's Eye; BACON inva-
riably, winter and summer, spring and au-
tumn, had fried sausages for breakfast, and
pork-chops for supper; DANIEL LAMBERT
was continually getting stout (Dublin); to
the discoverer of the circulation of the blood
we are also indebted for HARVEY'S Sauce;
ROGER ASCHAM, who has left us the beau
idéal of a book in his Toxophiliu, took a
bowl of arrowroot every night before going
to bed, flavoured with rum and molasses;
SIR WALTER RALEIGH was passionately fond
of early potatoes; DR. MEAD drank nothing
but metheglin; "Beau" NASH swore by
sprace beer; and Old PARR'S life was pro-
longed by elder wine.
DR. JOHNSON'S favourite dish was a suck-
ing-pig stuck with blanched almouds. and
stuffed with macaroons, and Chocolat Цетег,
and served with a rich sauce consisting of
currant jelly, chutney, anchovy paste, vanille,
the yolk of an egg, some horse-radish grated
fine, mushroom-catchup, and several other in-
gredients. MRS. THRALE took care always
to have this dish at table when JOHNSON
dined at the Brewery in Liquorpond Street,
along with Miss PORTER and HALES of Eton.

COMMENTING on the account, given by the
Times of the exportation of bones, taken from
mummy pits, from Egypt to England, to
be manufactured here into manure, the Echo
says—
"The rich fields of turnips and mangold» that
will spring from the desiccated skeletons of
CHEOPS' subjects will in turn become prime beef
and mutton, and Newgate Market will represent
the final stage of this curious transmigration of
bodies."
What a journey for our imagination to
take, from Egyptian CHEOPS to London
Chops!

HYMN TO SAINT TROFIMUS.
BY BPICUBUS AKTHBITICDS.
"The 29th of December is the Feaet-day of an Archbishop of Arle«, called
i St. Trofimus, whose bone* repose in the church of St. Philip Neri, and have
'the peculiar virtue of curing people of gout, lumbago, and the rheum, or, ai
the Italian eacred diary baa it, of podagra and chiarayra. Think of that, ye
gouty old gentlemen of England, who sit at home in anything but ease."—
Standard's Correspondent from Some.
SAINT TKOFIMI/S, Saint Trofimus, assist me, I implore,
Your saintly and respected name 1 never beard before:
Excuse me that I write to yon, although we 're never met,
You 're far too kind a gentleman to stand on etiquette.
My dear Saint Troilmus, don't mind my swearing, but my groans,
And make no bones of lending me the virtue of your boucs.
I own I am a Protestant, my light is small and dim,
But who can help protesting when fodagra claws his limb?
And yon 've been off, Saint Trofimns, quite long enough to know
How paltry the dissensions that embroil us here below—
Still, as you 're claimed by Catholics, as Catholic I sne,
Co«ßeor—\ '11 confesa: if that 's the proper thing to do.
Yes, culpa mea! I have loved, and fear may love again,
Hock, Sherry, Chablis, Burgundy, Moselle, Yqnem, Champagne,
Lafitte, Old Port, Noyeau, Chartreuse, Madeira, Punch in ice;
And, golly! good Saint Trofimus, ain't Manischiao nice P
Yes, metí magna culpa! "when the Turtle's voice is heard"
1 always take three plates, not always stopping at the third:
When other soups are gong, and I m puzzled to take which,
Richesse oblige, 1 make a choice of that as luoks most rich.
And when they bait for me with fish, a capture I must be—
(I 'm sure your friend 8t. Antony will say a word for me)
Dressed fish, Saint Trofimus, that sendeth transcendental steam,
With luscious soft concomitants, and sauce—a poet's dream.
Truffles, Saint Trofimus, I take in every given form,
Enriching other viands, or in paste alone, and warm:
They keep me humble, dear Saint T., upon my word they do,
They preach a lesson that a man's himself a fungus too.
I eat of each entree, dear Saint, in part because I like,
(Clean is the breast I make on which in penitence I strike),
But one little good intention to my credit place, I pray,
A hostess does not like to see her dishes sent away.
And on through stately dinners (and I go to all I can)
To eat and drink of everything is my poor simple plan,
And pasties and confections, all the things that ladies take,
I take 'em, too, and fancy 'tis for those dear ladies" sake.
Reluctantly, good Saint, I let or dish or wine go by,
We should prove all things—can I tell what's best until I try?
But then at night, to counteract aught that might disagree,
I swig two jolly brandy-grogs—sometimes, 1 fancy, three.
I take but little exercise, it really seems so hard
Prom honest gains a cabman should unkindly be debarred.
I don't much care for riding on the horses that they job,
And my weight would be oppressive to a steady-minded cob.
And I have gout! Saint Trofimus, which makes me wince and roar,
And wonder what I 've done to earn a punishment so sore,
And then the doctor comes, not kind, but grinning like a Ghoul,
"I told you how 'twould be," says he, " why are you such a Fool?"
He ties me up in flannels, says I 'm not to drink or eat,
He gives me beastly drugs, and Vichy water for a treat;
Ana when I cry for opiates, the fiend without remorse
Says, "No; the gout's a remedy, and it must take its course."
I am so stiff, I am so cross, no living tongue can tell,
If my foot touches aught that's hard, incontinent I yell,
My wrists have caught it too, dear Saint, which tempts me oft to swear;
I cannot fold a journal, write a note, or comb my bair.
One 's utter helplessness is, perhaps, the worst thing in the gout:
These very lines 1 dictate to my nephew (who's a lout)
And instead of writing rapidly when once my word he 's got.
The stupid donkey looks at me, and fatuously says, " What F"
The world 'в a blank, all folks are fools, and everything goes wrong,
The very hours have got the gout, and now are twice as long.
О core me, dear Saint Trofimus, and tend me back again
To Hock, Moselle, and Burgundy, Yquem, Lafitte, Champagne.
AN AWKWARD NAME.
WHAT a very nice letter was that one quoted by the Pall Mall
Gazette from the New Turk Independent, the composition of the junior
King of Siam—for Siam, like the Brentford of other days, has two
kings—addressed to an American lady, formerly a missionary among
the Siamese, who had known him when a child! A note which he had
received from her, he said, "called up many refreshing memories of
childhood." Here is phraseology that might be supposed to have
bien acquired at a diocesan training school. "Numerous changes have
taken place, and you would barely recognise Banzkok could you be
transported here." This might have been written by any of our con-
temporaries' own correspondents. So might all this :—
"Treaties were made with nearly all the great Powers of the West. Euro-
peans and Americans resorted hither for trade. An extensive commerce hag
been the result. This city has greatly improved in its appearance, ita build-
ings, roads, and canals. Beautiful square-rigged vessels and steamers are now
owned by the Siamese Government and Siamese merchants. The industry,
produce, and wealth of the country have correspondingly advanced
Peace and prosperity exist throughout the length and breadth of the king-
dom, and long may it continue, will doubtless be yours, as it i» my earnest
wish."
His Siamese Majesty sends his old acquaintance a set of coins of his
realm and a gold and silver cigar-box, whence we need not infer
t hat she smokes, but may surmise that the Siamese ladies do. He
allíctionatt-ly requests her to accept this present "as a keepsake from
vour once baby friend." His epistle concludes with a salutation quite
becoming the pen of a Christian gentleman :—
"My honoured mother aad other ladies of the Palace wish to be remem-
bered to you. Accept my best wishes for yourself, your husband, and your
SOB, and'believe me, '« yours truly ..
And then follows His Majesty's signature. It is a remarkable one :—
"K. P. R. PAWA» SATHAJ» MONGOL,
Second King of Siam, <tc., &c., &c.
Everybody must be struck with the incongruity of the KING OF
SUM'S fifth name, with his style of writing. The intervening aitch
makes no difference in a word which looks like a mere abbreviation of
SAT n ANAS. Who gare h im that same F No godfathers nor godmothers,
one would think: yet his letter, written in the terms above-copied, to
a missionary, seems to indicate that he had both, and that probably, in
his infancy. Had he been converted at riper years, he surely would
have repudiated a name which sounds so strange for a Christian one.
If he was actually christened thereby, there is perhaps no help for it,
unless MR. JAMBS BUG was canonically warranted in renaming him-
self NORFOLK HOWARD, discarding not only BUG for HOWAKD, but
JAMES for NORFOLK. But then, in like manner the KING OP SIAM
could alter S AT HAN to'MICHAEL.
BISHOPS IN BONDS.
WHAT has become of the "DAVENPORT Brothers P" When last we
heard of them they either were, or were in the way to be in gaol, ac-
cording to United States' law, for conjuring without a licence. The
following passage in a letter from the Time* Special Correspondent,
may be taken to show that those DAVENPORTS are in some degree
matched by certain performers at Rome. It refers to the Council :—
"Within that body the РОГЕ acts by a machinery and by procedures slowly
elaborated and perfected beyond a chance of miscarriage. On the other hand,
the opposition, be it one or only a name, cannot act for a hundred various
objections. It enters the Council not aa we Anglican» were mockingly invited
to euter, with ropes hanging round our necks, bnt with the ropes tightly
twisted and knotted round their limbs, and closing their very lips.
There is, however, a material difference between the spiritual oppo-
sition in the Pope s Council and the Spiritualist pretenders. The
latter did usually contrive to wriggle out of the ropes they were tied
with, whereas there seems to be no extricating themselves for BISHOP
DCPABLOUP and his companions.

BISHOPS TO MAKE! BISHOPS TO MEND!
"By the death of the BISHOP OF MANCHESTER another mitre ii placed at
the disnosiil of MR. GLADSTONE."—Ecclesiastical Intelligence.
"I hare always felt from the beginning that those who differed from me,
and who thought it their duty to express that difference, doing all that in
them lay to oppose both my Election and my Consecration, were actuated by
nothing but a sense of duty, and a desire to fulfil God's will, as far aa their
conscience showed it to them."—Bishop Temple'» Speech at Exeter.
HERE 's GLADSTONE has got a new Bishop to make—
The task may well cause e'en las courage to blench:
If Cabinet-making some trouble must take,
What 's Cabinet-making to making a Bench?
For Cabinet-work, free from priestly control,
You 'те but to determine the right stuff, and get it;
And when you 'те the peg that will best fit the hole,
Stick the one in the other, and keep where you 'те set it.
On Cabinet-work party judgments we know—
The sarcasm and sneers, and high-toned indignation—
But a Broad Bishop's choice calls to arms High and Low,
And clerical wrath takes the form of damnation.
These shepherds of souls will fight over a straw,
On what we call hairs see an eternity hanging:
For the Church defy Charity, Logic, and Law,
Turn their pulpits to prize-rings, their sermons to slanging.
The sounds of spent fight around TEMPLE still blend,
The air is still murky with smoke of the battle:
Still the sulphurous whiffs of Priests' powder ascend,
Still their protests explode, their anathemas rattle.
Still TROWER parades in his sackcloth and ashes,
Still DENISON calls Convocation to arms;
DR. WORDSWORTH his teeth o'er the Fathers still gnashes,
FUSE r pules, and the Record sounds shrilly alarms.
'Gainst such fury of High Church and frenzy of Low,
Such passion of Priests, and Priests' press party-fired,
What use is the witness a life's work can show.
The love and respect which that life has inspired?
As against Priestly shriek, and Episcopal groan,
That his courage condemn, and his manhood bewail.
What import lay affection, and reverence shown
In the farewells that follow, the welcomes that hail?
To the clam'rous confusion of orthodox herds,
The terror that rouses their bleats, baas, and lows,
What 's the calm Christian spirit that speaks in these words
Of respect for opponents, forgiveness for foes f
At Large.
APPROPRIATE names (and considerate acts) should always be re-
corded. The Keeper of Whitecross Street Prison, from which a large
number of debtors were liberated on the first of this month under the
New Act, is—MR. CONSTABLE; and it is pleasant to note what is said
of him, that he " acted in a humane manner [by giving a large number
of those in his custody leave to go directly the Act came into operation]
instead of prolonging the imprisonment of the persons until applica-
tions were made to a Judge at Chambers on Monday."
A GRAMMARIAN'S THOUGHT.
WHAT a contrast there sometimes is between the adjective and its
adverb! Reflect, for example, on the wide difference that exists
between the man who is constant in love, and the man who is constantly
in love!

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
DINE with DTNGTVELL at the large Restaurant's.
In my Room.—Ring bell. Tall German waiter answers. " He has a
way of understanding you before you speak—anticipatory style, pro-
voking.
He enters with "You riag?" I reply that I did. He returns. " I
thought so. You want some tea, some eggs, some coffee—what F
No. I teca going to have ordered tea, but I won't now, just to show
him that this is not the sort of thing to try with me. That I *m not
one of his ordinary travelling Englishmen. I order, consequently, some
sherry and seltzer. "Sherry and seltzer," he repeats, "anyting
else? No? No meat, no bread, no butter, nutting P No?"
This sort of thing makes one very angry: it's a liberty. I answer
sternly, "No, nothing else."
Happy Thought.—" Yes, a biscuit." I order this, because he hasn't
suggested biscuits. He replies, "Sherry, seltzer, biscuits, nutting
else? No? I bring you dem," and disappears. I say "disappears,
because he is round the corner of the door and oat on the landing
before I know he has gone. A pantomimic German.
Open my desk and commence reviewing my papers. Waiter back
again. "Sherry, seltzer, biscuits, all you want? No?" I say, almost
savagely (for it is just as if I was being worried into ordering some-
thing else, or hadn't ordered enough), Open the bottle."
He echoes me again. "Open? yes." He performs this quickly and
jerkily. "Zo. Put him in?"
Happy Thought.—To nod instead of replying, by way of checking
him.
"Anyting else?" he immediately asks. "No? nutting else?
no." He has vanished, before I recollect. But I do want to ask him
something. "Неге, вагсоя!"
Happy Thought.—Kellner, not вагсоя. "Kellner!"
He is back again from the bottom of two flights of stairs, in less than
five seconds. You call, yes? You want someting? No?"
"Yes; I want to know if there is anything going on here to-night?"
He shrugs his shoulders, and smiles vaguely.
"Is there?" I repeat.
"Yes, going on? Yes," he answers. His " Yes " is very prolonged;
a thoughtful affirmative.
"What is it?"
"Yes. Going on for day?" Then, after a moment's consideration,
he decides upon telling the truth, which takes this form, "I not know
what you say."
Happy Thought. — To put it thus, slowly, "Is-there-a-Concert,
any Music, or is the Theatre open?"
Oh!" a light breaks in npon him, "A Concert? No, no Con-
cert. De Tayarter is for tree days open. Not dis night. De Band in
de Elisa-garten in mornin play."
Happy Thought.—Very nice. Stroll there about eleven to-morrow.
Rank and fashion.
Ask the exact time of performance.
"Seven hour," he answers.
"Plays for seven hours!" I exclaim.
"No!" he laughs, and shakes his head as correcting his own mis-
take. "Seven о clock" (this very distinctly); "de Band play all
mornins from seven to eight."
What!!! Get up at six-thirty A.M. to go to a Concert at seven.
"Do many people go to this Concert at seven?" I can't help
inquiring.
All people here," he replies. I am staggered. What time is the
Theater then, I wonder. P raps at é A.M.
Suppers at ten in the morning, and fierce dissipation" at1, mid-day.
That П do. No, I don't want anything more.
Decision at present.—Not to go to the Concert in the Elisa-garten at
seven to-morrow morning. Examine conversation-book in four lan-
guages, in order to address the Chambermaid to-morrow morning on
the subject of wasser, boots, clothes, and bath.
The Chambermaid, I find, (to begin with) is a Zimmermädchen. This
is satisfactory.
Happy Thought.—To arrange (before I go to sleep to-night) a con-
versation with the Zimmermädchen. I think Gute» morgen is good
morning. Can't find it. Guien morgen, Zimmermädchen, will do very
nicely to begin with.
Happy Thought.—Must also master the coinage. They took francs
to-day in payment for my conversation-book. One thing at a time.
Zimmermädchen at first. How travelling does enlarge our views. 1
little thought two weeks ago that I should be calling any one a Zim-
mermädchen, and understanding what I meant by it. Also, mustn't
forget what I came for; i.e., to call on the Doctor, to whom I have
an introduction, and ask him if I have got rheumatic gout latent any-
where. If so where, and what 's to be done for it.
It is very cold at night.
Happy Thought.—To ask the Zimmermädchen in the morning for a
counterpane and more blankets. Look out "counterpane" and
"blankets," before I go to sleep, in dictionary, so as to remember
them in the morning.
Can't find " counterpane." Da» Belttuch is blanket.
Happy Thought.—Lookout "coverlet" instead of "counterpane."
Got it—Oberdecke. "Zimmermädchen" I will say, "Ich wünsche
eine Oberdecke und ztoei Betttuchs."
Sleep on it—I mean sleep on the phrase.
Wake in the morning: rehearse the speech to myself two or three
times. Add to it. Bringen Sie mir. [" Bring me," nothing more
simple: and it's wonderful bow sleeping in a foreign town brmgs the
language out of you in the mornin?, like the sulphur waters do to the
gout] — Bringen Sie mir heUs ¡fatter." "Hein" is "hot," and
yesterday I thought by the sound it meant just the contrary.
Am I ready to converse with Zimmermädchen? Yes. Ring the bell.
Rehearse again to myself quietly. Let me see, I 've forgotten what
"blankets" was. Shan't have time to look it out before she comes,
and it looks so absurd to read to her from a book.
Enter the Zimmermädchen. She wishes me, in her own native
tongue (I "11 astonish her presently), "Good morning." I feel a little
nervous—why should I be nervous? It 's nonsense to be nervous.
By the way I want a bath, and I 've forgotten to look it out. She has
brought some heiss Wasser, so the words I knew best I have not got to
say. .„. -.-.^t
Happy Thought.—Begin the conversation by alluding to the heiss
Wasser. Try to assume a careless easy tone, as if talking German had
been the amusement of my leisure hours for years. Odd, I feel that I
don't pronounce the words nearly so well as at my rehearsals.
"Sie haben heiss Vouer," I say it boldly. She is as much astonished
as Balaam was, I should imagine. It must come upon her like a voice
from the bed itself.
She laughs and replies, ,"heist Wasser, ja" Success: now for
number two.
"Oh, Zimmermädchen, I want "—failure. She stares—perhaps it
strikes her that I'm a great linguist, and know so many languages that
I'm mixing them up—perhaps it doesn't—"I mean Ich tcüntcte eine
Oberdecke?
"Nue vara genouf?" she asks; at least, so it sounds, and I un-
derstand it perfectly. Very like English, "Not warm enough?"
"Nein" 1 return in, this time, admirably grammatical German.
Now all I want her to say is, Yes, I '11 bring your oberdecke," and
while she 's gone I '11 look out "tepid bath" in the dictionary. But
she commences a series of questions, or remarks, or both, founded
evidently upon the mistaken impression, which my starting so fluently
in her own native tongue had giren her, that I talk and understand
German.
Happy Thought.—Stick to " Yah. eine Oberdecke."
She laughs (what at? I don't know) and goes away. Now then.
Bad is bath; tepid is ... tepid is ... not down—what a dictionary!
It will be worth while studying German here for the sake of my fellow-
countrymen who want dictionaries. Tepid is not in the conversation-
book. Kalt is cold, but I don't, want a cold bath. "If you please"
isn't in the conversation-book. Yet they seem a polite people. Perhaps
it wasn't a polite person who compiled this book.
Happy Thought.—Ein Bad mit kalt und heist Watter. Kalt und
heiss together must be tepid.
Re-enter Zimmermädchen, with 'such a coverlet! A bed in itself—
a sort of balloon stuffed with feathers, which she plumps down on the
bed. I can't explain that it is not at all the sort of thing I mean, because
I don't know the German for the phrase, and I can't keep her waiting
in the room while I find out the words in the dictionary. She says
something about "Das ist gut, so." And I reply (not to hurt her
feelings) ^'Yah, das ist goot." (Yah should be spelt, I find, "Ja"
-odd.)
"farmi"' says she.
"Very varm," I reply weakly, giving up my German and running
into bad English.
Then comes the "Ein bad" request. She does understand me, and
brings it.
Rise and go to breakfast with D TNG WELL.
Impressions of German language at first.—Not unlike broad Scotch if
talked by a nigger. "Yah, yah," just like the Christy Minstrels, is
always coming in.
Kot an Unreasonable Wish.
You often hear people speak of a cold "going through the house."
Poor SCAMBLEBÏ, whose wife and family are all now laid. up. and under
the doctor's care, says he wishes their cold had gone through the house
without stopping.
AGRICULTURAL QUESTION.
Is a landlord who allows his farms to be over-stocked with rabbits
entitled to be called a great bunnyfactor?

IN i liis doll season of the year,
With evenings Ion? and mornings dusky,
I often have a dreadful cold,
And find my voice get very husky.
I mentioned this to JONES one day,
Who answered me in accents solemn,
"Whenever this occurs, my boy,
Just try BROWNE'S Bronchial What-d'ye-calTem."
"But what 's the name? One cculdn't go
To DIETRICHSEN'S (the shop with columns,)
And tell 'em that you want to buy
A box of Bronchial 'What-d'ye-call'ems.'"
Says JONES, "I don't quite comprehend
The name BROWNE calls 'em, I confess;
But here it 's printed on the lid,
It's T. R. 0. C. H. E. S.
I went into a chemist's shop,
Who clearly thought me cutting jokes,
When I inquired, in accents mild,
If he 'd a box of Bronchial "Irolces."
I sought another shop, and growled,
"To call the things French names what bosh!"
Alas, my French availed me not
When I demanded Bronchial "IroaA."
I 've pretty well forgot my Greek,
BUD doubt if anybody sees
A reason why cough lollipops
Should take the name of light trochees.
I asked that charmer, JONES'S niece,
(With whom I caught my cold at croquet),
But her advice found no response
At druggists' shops. She said, "Try Trolcy."
What does it mean? BROWNE, you must feel

(ECUMENICAL ODDS AND ENDS.
THE Special Correspondent of the Times at Rome informs those
whom it may concern that :—
"The Council, which has hitherto separated by 11, did not iseue from the
Hall this morning till a quarter to 1—a very unwonted trial, I am told, to the
physical endurance of most of the Fathers.
Does not this information particularly concern4 the British House
of Commons F Might not Honourable and Right Honourable Gen-
tlemen at St. Stephen's advantageously take a lesson from Right
Reverend Fathers at St. Peter's F For the context of the above-quoted
passage shows that a quarter to one did not mean 12'45 A.M., but
1:245 P.M. To be sure Parliamentary debates are liable to be pro-
tracted, for one reason, because they are free; but freedom of, debate
need not be abused.
According to the same writer :—
"The POPE had commanded prayers for fine weather in all the churches.
Late in the afternoon there came word that the Tiber was in the streets."
"But," he observes farther on, the next day :—
"Everything was bright and glorious in the morning sun."
And DR. MANNING perhaps exclaimed "All right!"
Another Correspondent of the Times says :—
"A Roman wit haï discovered, he says, the habits of all the Western
Bishops. The English are always taking out something to eat; the American
Bishops are retiring to smoke."
Time does indeed work wonders more wonderful than those of
Chassepôt rifles at Rome. Fancy ATHANASIUS with a cigar in his
mouth—or CYPRIAN with a short pipe, which may have been preferred
by the Yankee analogues of ATHANASIUS and CYPRIAN. Or imagine
the Nicene Fathers continually tucking in sandwiches.
A letter in the Pall Mall Gazette gives the POPE'S apology for his
army. Here is part of it :—
"As to St. Peter, it is true that he also had no army, but he possessed such
power that, by one word from hie mouth, he struck dead calumniator! and
revolutionists, as instanced in the case of ANANIAS and SAPPHIBA. But.
unhappily, the successors of St. Peter are not endued with this supernatural
power, and therefore they are obliged to defend themselves by bayoneta from
the attacks of impiety."
Unhappily F For the Roman Pontiff or the human race F Sappose
that papal fulminations had been exertions of power to wield real
thunder. In that case, doubtless, they would not have been bruta
fulmina, and the successors of St. Peter would never have needed to
go to the expense of an army. But when the POPE complains that lie
"unhappily" has not the supernatural power of killing people, does
he mean to pronounce, infallibly, that power to have been unhappily
withheld F
The following paragraph also appeared in the Pall Mall:—
"A Romrui Correspondent notes the exploit of two English 'misses,' who,
mounted on the benches above the kneeling multitude, surveyed with their
opera-glasses the POPB as he pronounced the benediction in the Council. The
ГОРЕ, with a mild smile, pointed them out to some of the cardinals, but no
alarming consequences have overtaken them."
Of course not. It is easy to understand what the POPE'S uüld smile
meant. No doubt his Holiness took the beautiful beings who pre-
sented themselves to his enraptured vision for angels.

PESTERED BY POST.

PUNCH, — I'wish there were
some easy means of getting
anybody mesmerised so as to
acquire the temporary power
of clairvoyance.
I am out of town, as usual
at this season of the year.
As usual I have my letters
forwarded to me, because I
want to keep myself posted
up. As usual the post
brings me no end of cir-
culan.
My name happens to
stand on a professional list
accessible to all men. The
consequence of this is that
my letter-box is the daily
receptacle of circulars and
prospectuses sent me by all
manner of cheap wine-mer-
chants, coal-merchants, puff-
ing tradesmen of all descrip-
tions, joint-stock companies
(limited), foreign lottery
bffices, charitable institu-
tions, and appeals, chiefly
clerical, to the benevolent.
Now, Sir, I have not
give me a needless shock. But I have the satis-
faction of flinging them into the fire, and con-
sidering that the sender has thrown away a
stamp.
But. Sir, that is just what I am made to do
myself, through my servant, when she posts me
circulars not knowing what they contain. Now,
could she be rendered clairvoyant«, she would
then be enabled to distinguish between letters
of some consequence, and letters of none. It is
true she would also become acquainted with
their contents. But clairvoyantes, «hen denies-
merised, are said to forget everything that they
have experienced in their lucid state.
If advertisers of all kinds, and clergymen who
apply for subscriptions, would only be so consi-
derate ae to write on the back of their envelopes
"Circular," or " Appeal," they would enable my
servant to know what to do, and what not to do:
they would assist her to light her lire, and would
save considerable expense to

GAME FOB THE CHANNEL.— BeSick.
BEEFEATERS ABROAD.
PHILOSOPHIC Ртшсн,
HERE we are again, the idiotic clowns say—at that saddening
time of year, which cynics have sarcastically called the festive season.
Ugh! how mentally I shudder at the roast beef and boiled turkey, the
mince-pies and plum-puddings, on which I am condemed to dine for
the next few weeks! Why cannot people take a leaf out of French
cookery books, and vary the monotony of Christmas fare—and fowl-
whereby the festive season to my mind is made hideous P I declare I
think next Christmas, if I survive the present, I shall desert my wife
and children, 'and go over to Paris to escape the beef and turkeys.
Even there, however, I perhaps may find them rampant, for my news-
paper informs me that—
"Taken all in all, France may be no worie in point of cookery than
England or Germany, but it is hardly better. Amongst British travellers
there are still a few enthusiasts who go into raptures over the fare provided at
the monster hotels and the more famous restaurants. But Frenchmen them-
selves are of a different opinion, and it is a significant fact that the restaurants
most popular with French barristers, journalists, artists, officers, and well-to-
do bachelors in general are precisely those where the dinner is of an English
kind; thr is, where a cortege of solemn-looking joints is wheeled in at six
o'clock anu made to do duty as the staple article of the evening's dinner."
If Frenchmen take to dining daily off the joint, perhaps they next
may copy us in limiting their Christmas fare to roast beef and boiled
turkey. Pantomimes may also be transplanted to their stage, and
when the clown makes the remark of " Ici nous sommes encore!" he may
be greeted with a burst of hearty quasi-British merriment. The sight
of Frenchmen gravely—or gravy-ly, if you prefer it so—dining off the
joint is one that may indeed provide food for reflection. It is generally
ccnceded that the dinner makes the man, and if Frenchmen leave off
dining upon light and airy kickshaws, and eat solid solemn-looking and
substantial food, we shall soon cease to regard them as our lively neigh-
bours. They will become as sensible, sedate, and snobbish as ourselves:
and who knows but that Frenchmen, after dining à l'Anglaise off the
joint, may not by their joint endeavours infuse some British blood into
the body of their State, and feebly imitate the strength of the British
Constitution.
With all the compliments of the season, and much good may they do
you! believe me, yours respectfully, JEREMIAH GROWLER.

THE GREAT ANGLO-GALLIC AMALGAMATION
COMPANY.
THE following bit of news, we fear, is too good to be true :—
"A brilliant idea has been put forward by a Frenchman, who proposes to
unite England and France by ailing up the British Channel with rubbish."
A brilliant idea, truly! But how can it be realised? And what is
to become of France, supposing that this bright idea be really carried
out? France is every day becoming more and more like England.
Frenchmen eat roast beef, keep bulldogs, and drink beer, and even
aspire, some of them, to drive a four-in-hand. There are London fogs
in Paris as thick as any that we Londoners cau boast about at home.
Our French friends nave their Clubs, where they actually play whist
(although they cannot quite pronounce it), and where they bet upon
their Derby as well as on our own. They even venture—some of
them—to risk their lives and limbs in the deadly game of " crickets-
match," or in the dangerous "régates des rowinsr-botts." In short.
France is well nigh England, even though the British Channel still
separates the countries, and, if this is to be filled up, there will really
be no telling who are English and who French. Port wine and Magna
Charta will be paramount in Paris, and the Tuileries will receive the
name of " Liberty Hall."
Who will start the Great Anglo-Gallic Amalgamation Company?
If merely "rubbish" be required for filling up the Channel, both
French and English Parliaments might furnish a supply.

THE AFFAIR-PETEE.
"A SACRED Mission," according to M. BB ROCHEFORT, in the
French Chamber, was the business on which M. VICTOR NOIR, alias
SALOMON, visited PRINCE PETER BONAPARTE, the result being homi-
cide, if not murder.
Let us overhaul this story, and put it into English, not French. We
are a law-abiding sort, and don't know much about Sacred Missions.
Corsican journal, La Revanche, assails EMPEROR NAPOLEON and his
family with brutal scurrility.
Cousin PETER NAPOLEON (son of LUCIEN) makes furious reprisals
in Corsican journal, L'Avenir.
Paris journal, Marsellaue (Ds ROCHEIORT'S), in ruffianly manner
attacks PRINCE PETER.
PRINCE PETER writes to DE ROCHEFORT, inviting him to kill or be
killed.
DE ROCHE KOKT has been ordered by his constituents not to fight.
PASCHAL-GREUSSET, somehow connected with Corsican La Se-
vanche, and DE ROCHEFORT'S underling, sends two men to PRINCE
PETEB, inviting him to kill or be killed. The two are M. VICTOR
NOIR SALOMON, and M. ULRIC ÏONVIELLE, ex-editor of a Dieppe
paper. This is the Sacred Mission. The two call on PRINCE PETER
—PASCHAL-GREUSSET and a companion waiting outside.
FONVIELLE, one of the Sacred Missionaries, has a sword-cane and a
loaded revolver.
PRINCE PETER has a loaded revolver in his pocket.
There is a stormy interview. PRINCE PETER will fight DE ROCHB-
гонт, but not his "workmen." Has something pleasant to say about
"carrion-mongers."
Somebody strikes somebody. Only two men are alive who know the
truth, and each says that the other lies.
The Prince fires his pistol, and kills VICTOR NOIR.
FONVIELLE tries to fire at the Prince, but does not seem to know
how. The Prince fires at him, perhaps twice, and FONVLELLE goes
away.
PRINCE PETER goes to the Conciergerie, and surrenders himself, in
anticipation of the course of the EMPEROR and the new Minister of
Justice, who, independently, order his arrest. He asks for a common
Sry. but, as a member of the EMPEROR'S family, has to be tried by the
igh Court of Justice.
DE ROCUEFORT rages in the Chamber, talks of the Borgias, of
Sacred Missions, and impugns the character of the High Court.
He is sternly rebuked by M. OLLIVIER. His journal for previous
sedition is seized, and he is to be prosecuted.
His journal, the day after the killing of Nom, is devoted solely to
brutal abuse of the NAPOLEONS.
M. NOIR is buried, a great mob attending. DE ROCHZFORT alter-
nately rages and faints, and finally, trying to head a procession, is
informed oy an officer that, if he persists, he will be the first man cut
down. He goes home.
Mob, but not a large one, in Paris. Tradesmen come out with
sticks, and threaten rioters. They go home, having stabbed a policeman.
Such is the story of the Sacred Mission, up to Mr. PuncKs present
date of writing. It suggests Apes and Dead Sea Apples, insolence,
blood-thirstiness, and general brutality. But let us wait the sequel of
the Affair-Peter.
An Article not Headed.
"PARIS, Jan. 7.—Yesterday CODNT DARU, the new Minister of Foreign
Affairs, received the heads of me Foreign Legations."
WE are very grieved to hear it, and sincerely sympathise with the
bereaved embassies. A sad beginning this of the new Minister's
official career, and one not calculated to preserve friendly relations
with Foreign countries. How can COUNT DARU declare, as is asserted,
that France will " continue to abstain from interfering in the domestic
affairs of other countries," when he thus materially interferes with
the personal comfort of their recognised Representatives '( Diplomatists
(occasionally even our own) have before now lost their heads, but then
it was their own doing, and not the act of those to whom they were
accredited.

AN EXTEA LAW LOBD.
THE question of Life Peerages will probably be re-
opened, if there is any truth in the report that a leading
functionary in connection, with the legal Executive will
shortly be exalted to a seat in the House of Lords. The
gentleman for whom this honour is supposed to be de-
signed is one whose services have extended over a period of
many years. Though still retaining all the mental energies
which he ever possessed, he is said to have suffered some
impairment of those physical abilities demanded by the
peculiar nature of his office. Humanity requires the due
adjustment of the noose, and Justice the adequate appli-
cation of the lash: but the ends of both Justice and
Humanity »re foiled by the unsteadiness and debility of
the Executioner. It is, therefore, desirable that a dignified
and pensioned, yet not idle retirement, should be allotted
to the bodily enfeebled but still mentally vigorous Finisher
of the Law. Elevation to the Peerage seems an honour
not unsuitable to one who has himself been instrumental
in elevating many others out-of-doors; and there are
reasons why that honour should not in this case be here-
ditary. It is therefore to be hoped that the Law Lords
will interpose no obstacle to the promotion of that dis-
tinguished officer. Let them remember how often his
hands have rendered the learned Judges that important
service necessary to the ultimate fulfilment of their behests.
On consideration their Lordships will not fail to per-
ceive that the institution of Life Peerages already exists
in the Bench of Bishops, and therefore no real innovation
will be effected in conferring a Peerage, for lilb only, on
MR. CALCRAÍT. But whether HER MAJESTY may be
advised to create MR. CALCRAIT a Life Peer, or to
invest him with a minor dignity, everybody must see that
it is high time he was decently superannuated.
We had almost forgotten to state that the title by
which Government proposes to call MR. CALCRAFT to

IMPOBTANT CABINET EEVELATION.
As the PRESIDENT OP ТПЕ BOARD oï TRADE declined to reveal the
secrets of the Cabinet in regard to the Irish Land Bill, Mr. Punch,
feeling that the nation must not be kept in suspense any longer, has
obtained French leave to publish an outline of the measure about to be
proposed. It is of a very general and comprehensive kind, The details
may be revised, but the main points are as follows :—
1. The name of Ireland is to be abolished, and that island is to be
called in future Sisterland.
2. The Brogue is to be forbidden, except in the case of very pretty
young Irish girls, who are to obtain a licence from Mr. Punch to use
it, on payment of certain fees.
3. The Blarney Stone is to be publicly smashed, to signify the end
of the reign of humbug.
4. Oranges (except at dessert) and Ribbons, (except for ladies) are
to be for ever excluded from Sisterland.
5. All Fenians are to be handed to our ally, the EMPEROR OP RUSSIA,
who, for a consideration, undertakes to instruct them in mining, for an
indefinite period.
6. All other cultivators of the soil are to be removed, in great com-
fort, in Her Majesty's ships, to Australia, where farm buildings and
lana will be provided for them, and where they will remain for a period
not exceeding (unless they wish it) Five Years. They will be taught
high-farming during this time.
7. The whole of the Irish Landlords will be sent to Scotland, where
the Dukes have undertaken to provide them with residences, and
where they will learn economical habits, and their duties towards their
dependents.
8. Sisterland being thus cleared, Scientific Companies, composed
of skilful farmers, will survey the lands, and contracts will be taken
for putting them into proper cultivation, with all the improvements.
This process to last for Five Years.
9. The Priests will be sent to lióme, by arrangement with the Holy
Chair.
10. The Parsons will be sent to China, by arrangement with the
Brother of the Moon.
11. At the end of the Five Years, a number of the Australian
sojourners, sufficient to cultivate the island on rational principles, will
be selected in the fairest manner, by lot, brought home, and placed on
the improved farms. They will pay a proper rent, to be collected by
the Government.
12. When this settlement shall have taken place, a Competitive
Examination of Landlords will be held; and to such as seem qualified
to form a desirable Upper Class, residences in Sisterland will be
allotted, with a Government allowance, subject to conditions of
behaviour.
13. The cities will be cleansed, drained, and improved, and all
beggars will be sent to the Red River.
11. No Journal will appear, except licensed by Mr. Punch.
15. An English Princess will be created Vice-Queen of Sisterland,
will constantly reside in the island, and hold Courts in each of the four
provinces.
16. Mr. Punch will be Dictator-General, with absolute power of life,
death, and dinner-parties.
PICKLES!
AT an education meeting the other day a MR. PICKLES, an engineer,
illustrated his acquaintance with the subject by stating that "the
students at Harrow, for instance, have to pay fees for cock-fighting
and fisticuffs." PÍCELES is quite right. There is also a bear kept by
the head-master, to be baited on Sunday afternoons, the dogs must be
bond fide the property of boys: the under-masters are bound to keep
ducks, which are hunted on a pond every Wednesday: cocks are
thrown at by the younger lads: and there is a greased Maypole erected
once a week, to ,be climbed by the higher forms. It is delightful to
think how the good cause of education most prosper, when those who
take it in hand are so well informed as is Мк. PÍCELES.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROME AND RAMSBOTHAM.
[Mas. RAMSBOTHAM, Junior, writing from Home during (he present
"Economical Consul," at the callt it, gitet us the following infor-
mation^
DKAR MR. PUHCH,
I HAVE ascertained a great many things about the Roman
Candlestick rights and cemeteries, which other Co-respondents of the
daily papers are unable to get hold of.
My poor dear Mother, when alive, used to tell me how "the POPE
lived in a Vacuum ;" and she was quite right, for the Palace so-called is
still here, and Pious THE NINTH (or MASTER FRETTY, as his real name
is) decides in it.
Talking of rights and cemeteries, there are some very peculiar. For
instance, once a year the good POPE says mass in the Cufern. I wonder
he 's so well, considering his age. and the dampness of such a place.
The Cistern, it is true, is fitted up as a chapel, and painted and
decorated ; but / recollect well enough what our cistern was for a long
time after it had been cleaned out, a nasty, mucky, damp, dirty place
as you wouldn't let a cat sleep in, let alone a Human Being saying
Mass.
An Imminent Dilatory of the Roman Church tells me that it ie one
of Pope's Priliveges, ana likewise of some cannons too (though what
cannons have to do with it, unless it's something to dp with the
Temple Power that they talk off, not the Spirituous, which is different
altogether) ai I was saying, it 's the prilivege of the POPJÍ and some
others to eay Mass in their Night-Caps. But Lor! what a prilivege!
I wouldn't say anything to anybody in mine. I have been here from
the first, which is from the eighth of December last.
Oh! The antipathies of the place! Wonderful!! all old, every bit
of it. And talk of Underground Railways in London!! Ah, you
should see the Roman Currycombs made by the earliest Christian
Marthas, who used to meet between 2 and 3 A.M. to sing hymns for
fear of prosecution.
MB. ROSSY is the Great Antipathy here. I think it 's the same that
invented that large telescope in Ireland somewhere.
My attention is always being drawn off by some friend to the monu-
ments of ancient Rome. Why call them monuments, when they 're
not a bit like'ours in the City? But that 's the worst of imitations.
Our Monument at home, by the way, was built by Roman Candlesticks,
in remembrance of the Fire of London, wasn't it P Or am I confusing
that with the Tower?
But, there, I "m wandering from my point.
They won't be able to call the Roman Bishops " a lot of old women"
in future, because it's well known that a lot of old women can't keep
secrets and these do. You can't get anything out of 'em.
Oh! it is a grand sight to see all the Carnavals in purple, the
Bishops, the Petrarchs, and the gorgeous Larkymantrites of the East
walking in profession. The only report about is. that some people
don't think the Great Doctor will lie put forward this time, and some
people do. The Great Doctor is, of course, as you know, intended to
declare that the POPE is Invaluable.
There are two great and celebrated Churches in Rome. One is the
Sir Peter's, and the other, for distinction, is the Other'un, or to speak
correctly, the Latter'un; but I am given to understand that this title
is only used when you speak of Sir Peter's as the Former'un.
The new year was hushed in by the Cannons of SIK ANGELO, not the
same as those I mentioned before, they were men, these are distillery.
I recollect a MR. ANGELO, who used to teach my brothers fencing, and
single sticks and other sticks ; perhaps it 's the same gentleman knighted
and got Cannons. Lucky man to get "Cannons; a lovely park it
was some years ago in the neighbourhood of Edgware, and belonged to
a nobleman, who nas now departed this life and every other.
They don't know much about spelling here. Look at this, copied
from a list of a Commission. You'll also observe some queer things
about these "Commissionaires" of the Roman Candlestick persua-
sion :—
1. INNOCENT SANNIHAu, Bishop of Gnbbio.
I thought Gnl/bin» bad enough for a name, and I don't like my own;
but "GUBBIO!" goodness! he must be an Innocent. The next is
evidently a Scotch gymnastic, only I never saw "Toddy" spelt like
that before; but, there! the hash the foreigners do make of our lan-
guage I
8. JOITK ROSATI, Bishop of Todi.
3. JULIO ARRIGONI, Archbishop of Lucca.
I always said that I thought MLLE. LUCCA, was a very good person,
and I am not sorry to see she has an Archbishop all to herself. I 've

THE CABMAN OF THE FUTURE.
THANKS to the new Cab Act, we are to see, if we live long enough,
some improvement in our cabs; and it is actually within the bounds of
possibility that we may discover some improvement in their drivers.
Who can tell what changes may be wrought both in their manners and
demeanour, now that they arc allowed by law to charge just what they
please—if they do but hoist a flag to tell us what they do please: and
now that they no longer groan beneath the tyranny of vexatious legis-
lation?
May we not expect to find them civil, cleanly, courteous, and even
conscientious f Instead of growling out " Wot 's this!" when they
are paid their proper fare, may they not be found to receive it with a
bow and a few graceful words expressive of their respectful gratitude F
or if they conceive themselves entitled to more than has been offered
them, may they not remonstrate with inch elegant persuasiveness that
nobody will have the heart to turn a deaf ear to their pleading?
Cabs have hitherto been commonly mere vehicles of abuse. Let us
hope the Cab Reform fill, which was passed last Session may lead to
a reforming of the language of the cabmen.
BALL PRACTICE.
"STUPID things, these country dances," observed the brilliant
CAPTAIN ASTERISK to his partner during a Sir Boger de Coverley.
"I'm sorry to see that you can blow hot and cold at the same
time," replied, archly, the fascinating Miss STARRS.
"How so?" inquired the gallant dragoon, smiling.
"Because," returned the witty heiress, pointing her sparkling epigram
by a dart of her costly fan between the light-hearted soldier's fifth and
sixth rib, "because I see that while you are abusing the dance you are
also standing up for it."
The dashing militaire was at this moment summoned to join in
"hands across."
*** Under the head of Ball Practice I propose from time to time to
suggest "good things to say" at dances, to Partners, £c., &c. Con-
sidering the ordinary difficulties of conversation under these circum-
stances, such a Handy Volume will be, I am sure, most welcome.

THE NEW HACKNEY-CARRIAGE ACT.
JOHN THOMAS AND THE COACHMAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR MISSUS' BEING AT THE SOUTH KENSINGTON LKCTUSE.
BRIGHT STILL BKIGHTER.
BBAVO, JOHN BKIGHT, Bravo once and again!
You were always a trump in your way—
For all the hard knocks that from Punch you have ta'en,
Your Bobadil bounce and your Drawcansir strain,
That set down all for fools who were not in the vein
To see with your eyes what to you was quite plain,
And drove you to charge your opponents a-main,
Or a-muck, like a Quaker Malay!
What you lacked was awhile the cold douche to enjoy,
That on high-heated hopes Office throws:
To learn, that as gold, ere 'tis coined, needs alloy,
So they who 'd spread truth with least fret and annoy
Must oft some amalgam of error employ:
That to bear with the folly we wish to destroy,
Is the way to graft wisdom on man or on boy,
To make hindrances helps, friends of foes.
And these lessons you 're learning, I 'm happy to see,
From your Birmingham speech, my dear JOHN;
You own there are shoals that when close on our lee,
Seem to tax skill and courage in higher degree,
Than when they rose out of the future's far sea:
That who differ in means yet on ends may agree,
And that compromise cowardice need not to be,
But oft points us the right course to con.
You 've learnt caution and measure, and reticence too—
For which lessons you've Office to thank—
To warn folks against expectations undue;
That in politics Tour is oft not two and two;
That the road we prefer we can't always pursue;
That there 's many a slip 'twixt to will and to do;
That indirect words must not needs be untrue,
And that all rogues and fools aren't of rank.
And, last lesson and best, you have learned and yon teach
That, let Governments do what they can,
The hardest and largest Reform, is what each
Of the millions of England can do, and not preach:
For himself and his household, to guard every breach
Through which Satan the fortress of Man's-soul doth reach-
Be it ignorance, sottishness, foul act or speech,
That to level of brute lowers man.
By such means could'st thou our waste classes reclaim,
What a place in our annals were thine!
A name written high above every name
By history set in the blazon of fame;
For the partizau hubbub of blessing and blame,
The thanks of a nation, uplifted from shame,
The wild beasts of our cities made gentle and tame,
And the Cross, from our Shame, grown our Sign!
AN AWFUL HIDING.
IN the Council at Rome the other day, MpNSiONOR STROSSMEYER,
Bishop of Bosnia, delivered a violent invective against the Jesuits,
which FATHER BECZ, the Jesuit General, sat under and listened to,
smiling. The Pall Mall tells us :—
"'TVbat would you?' he afterwards said to a high personage. 'Мон-
siii.N mi STUOSSMRYHU ia in the right. Nobody deplores more than myself the
excesses of the Civiltd Cattolica. I knew it's intemperate language woull
draw hatred on our Order, which desirve to live in peace with all the world;
and I commanded its writer» to refrain from giving such offence; but they
were urged on by a superior will to mine, and instead of being able to impose
silence on them, I was ordered to be silent myself.'"
The smile with which FATHER BECZ heard the Jesuits abused is
quite intelligible. He did not feel the lash of BISHOP STROSSMEYER.
But somebody else, perhaps, did. And surely it was very unnltra-
montane, if not impious, of FATHER BECZ to smile. For in fact was

JOHN BRIGHT'S NEW REFORM BILL-"REFORM YOURSELVES!"
"It is a fact that no Government, that no administration, that no laws,
that no amount of industry or of commerce, that no extent of freedom can give
prosperity and solid comfort to the homes of the people unless there be in
those homes economy, temperance, and the practice of virtue. {Cheer».") This
whii.'U I am preaching is needful for all. But it is specially needful for those
whose possessions are the least abundant and the least secure. If we could
subtract from the ignorance, the poverty, the suffering, the sickness, and the
crime, irhich are now witnessed among us, the ignorance, the poverty, the
suffering, the sickness and the crime which are caused by one single, but most
prevalent, bad habit or vice—the drinking needlessly of that which destroys
body and mind and home and family ;—do we not all feel that this country
would be so changed, and so changed for the better, that it would be almost
impossible for us to know it again."—Peroration of the Sight Honourable

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A GRACIOUS EVANS, AND A CHARMING
DICK WHITTINGTON.
BLIGHTED Punch begs to ex-
press his great personal obli-
gations to MB. EVANS, one
of the Clowns in the Crystal
Palace Pantomime. MR.
EVANS has given Mr. Punch
a kind and degree of plea-
sure which Л/г. Punch, as
an ancient Paterfamilias,
rather blase to Christmas
junketings and jollifications
generally, whether in the
shape of turkeys or trans-
formation scenes, padding
or pantomime, did not think
it wag in Christmas clown-
ins; to rive him.
This Crystal Palace Clown
is not only a very surprising
leaper, and an excellent
tumbler,—his tumbling hav-
ing, as all good clowns'
tumbling should have, hu-
mour, character, and mean-
ing in it,—but he understands that Clown is a great «cling part, and
he acts it, as Mr. Punch has not seen it acted since his dear old friend
JOEY GRIMALDI was permanently engaged for the great Olympic
pantomime, tice Momus discharged. He is cne of two clowns in the
pantomime; and the other,—ROWELLA,—is extremely good also,
though in a less exceptional way. MR. EVANS makes out by far the
most amusing scenes of the Harlequinade, without one of those
billy flap or box tricks which are so deadly dull, entirely out of the
proper Clown's occupations—of shop-lifting and love-making; and
he transacts both with a humour, significance, and drollery combined,
•which, by themselves, would carry off a far worse Pantomime.
Mr. Punch must further offer a word of thanks to Miss CAROLINE
PARKES, the young lady who plays Dick Whittington. She sings
sweetly and correctly, acts with great spirit and intelligence, speaks
her lines with point and distinctness, dances sailors' hornpipes, nigger
breakdowns, or regular pas d'opéra with equal precision, grace, good
taste, and nimbleness; and, now and then, does all these things, in
the same iceaa, in a style that leaves one at a loss whether most to
admire her many-sidedness of accomplishment, or her wonderful
soundness of wind and perfection of training.
In short the managers of the Crystal Palace Pantomime have drawn
two trumps—in their Clown, MR. EVANS, and their Dick Whiitington,
Miss CAROLINE PARKES; and Mr. Punch is delighted to pay his debt
of honest acknowledgment for pleasure received at their respective
dressing-room doors.

OPTIONAL TAXATION.
"А'м thunkin," says MR. DUNCAN M'CRAE, "that the maist inte-
restin' soobjic o" confederation, an' reflection, sax days oot o' the
seeven, is feenance. It is the ane towpic aye uppermaist in ma mind.
My aiu feenance is what preencipally an' habitually occupies ma
thochts; an' whan I hae dune thunkiu' o' that, then A' thunk aboot

creest, tax on/thing ye like that A' can dispense wi'; but dinna tax ma
! whnsky—dinna tax my income. Dimia hender me frae layin up a

N00, Punchie, there's naethin a mon can better want than a wife
an" fawmily, specially a fawmily. They 're пае neecessawries o' life,
an" I hae kent verra few cases where they were comforts. Whether
onybodie will be burdened wi' 'em or not a" thegither depends upon

notion o' compellin ¡very Paterfamilias o' noo taxable income, or
Materfamilias, if the Pater is eenaccessible, to tak oot a license for

cost q' ither men's bairns. Forbye the Bearins Tax then, in his next
Boodjet, let BOBBIK LOWE just clap on a Bairns Tax. An* noo dinna
say a Scotchman canna mak a joke.
THE TRUE JOURNALIST.
M. ALBERT WOLÏÏ, of the Figaro, writing of VICTOR Nom, or
SALMON, the victim in the wretched "free fight " at Auteuil, says :--
"He was twenty years old, Uus poor child juet dead in so tragic a manner.
Twenty year»! ... The unhappy child was built like a Hercules, and
gentle as a lamb. . . . He had no time to prove whether he had talent,
but hie temperament was that of a true journalist. . . . He had all the
instincts of his profession, but never took the trouble to learn anything: he
loved the Republic, not so much from reasoning as from a generous sentiment.
. . . Intractable when he had to defend those whom he loved, he was the
kindest being in the world when his own person only was at stake. . . .
Though just twenty, he had proved hie courage in several duela."
M. WOLFF leaves us to find out which trait here especially indicates
"the temperament of the true journalist ": the build of the Hercules—
the gentleness of the lamb—the never taking the trouble to learn any-
thing—the love of the Republic, not so mucn from reasoning аз senti-
ment—the intractability in defending others—the kindness when his
own person was at state—the several duels fought before he was
twenty ;—but, probably, we are meant to infer that all these charac-
teristics combined make up "the true journalist." If so, happy the
country, we should say, which had fewest of them. For the idea M.
WOLFF'S picture leaves on one is of a strong-bodied, loose-minded,
unread, unreasoning, rash, quarrelsome character, reckless of his own
Ufe or that of others, with the quality of personal kmdnees, for its half-
pennyworth of bread to its intolerable quantity of combustibles.
The true journalist" should be the best possible instructor. What
sort of instruction is a country to look for from journalists after M.
WOLFF'S ideal P
A RE-APPEARANCE.
"MRS. KHKI.KV appeared at MR. CHARLES MATHEWS' benefit, in the small
part of one of the Nieces in SHERIDAN'S Critic, and received a perfect ovation,
tibe seemed to have lost none of her old power, and we could not help re-
gretting the long absence from the stage of a real goniua in comedy, whom, it
is not too much to say, no actress, with one exception, now before the public
can approach."—General Opinion.
I SAW her for a moment,
I thought of days gone by,
When with Twice Killed
The House was filled,
And in the pit stood I.
I thought of Betsy Baker
With her bonnet and her pattens!
I ought to grow thin now-a-days,
If true, that laughter fattens.
We 've farces, comedies, burlesques, and weary seek our beds,
The Legs of the profession we can see, bat not its Heads.
It isn't that I 'm old and like to praise a former age,
But «e 've scarcely got one genuine comic actress on the stage—
As I would not give offence, I will not speak my mind out freely,
But long 'twill be ere I shall see another MRS. KEELEY.
APPALLING ANNOUNCEMENT.
I SAY, you say, he says, we say, ye say, they say! Just look here!
Somebody—no, we should think that we would not give him the benefit
of an advertisement—announces that he has a new composition, whereof
he makes table knives; something which is better than steel, for this
reason, among others :—
"6th.—It is also intended to make obsolete, or unnecessary, the rule of
etiquette which precludes the Knife from being placed to the mouth, thus
putting the eater often to inconvenience, and depriving the appetite of choice
aliment."
Do we live in a century following that which held CHESTERFIELD—
a century that holds Punch? Is the world at an end, or not? We
"only ask for information," as people say.
Give an Inch.
TITE elevation of M. OLLIVIER to power at the head of a Liberal
Ministry is significant. Such a man and such a ministry cannot allow
the liberties of France and the powers of the EMPEROR to remain
where they are. That France has got something by the tenatui con-

OFF, ODGEB!
MB. BRIGHT has been making some
speeches at Birmingham. In one of them
lie discouraged the doctrine that Working
Men—that is, artisans—ought to be elected to
Parliament merely because they are Working
Men. He thinks that this would be mere
class representation. The object of electors
should be to get the best man, let him be of
what vocation he may.
MR. BRIGHT'S view is, of course, open to
be controverted. But Mr. Punch holds it
undesirable that it should be controverted
in language like that used by Ma. Ош; к к,
who. as a Working Man, seeks to be elected
for Soutliwark.
MR. ODGER said,—" He icat afraid that
MR. BRIGHT, having basked ¡a the samkine of
Royally, had caught the Queen's Ecit, or been
inoculated by the uunkeys turroundiny the
throne."
Tliis speech, GEORGE ODGER, is simply
vulgar, indecent, aud insolent; and whether
Southwark desires to be represented hy a
Working Man or not, it, containing thou-
sands of self-respecting men, cannot desire
to be represented by a person capable of
delivering such language. Your continuing
a Candidate is an insult to your fellow
Working-Men aud to the rest of the Con-
stituency. Home, and learn decency.

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
THE Doctor comes while we are at breakfast, and takes me by sur-
prise. There are eggs, tongue, grilled chieken-cum-mushrooms on the
table; abo, coffee, tea, and preserve. I am munching buttered toast,
and generally speaking haven't been so thoroughly well or less like
an invalid in the whcle course of my life.
Waiter says, "This is the Herr," pointing to me, and introduces us.
DOCTOR CASPAR begs 1 won't derange myself (in excellent English),
and will call again. I suppose he means call again when I 've done the
battered toast, and am more like an invalid.
Mem.—It 's odd that whenever a Doctor calls upon me, as a patient,
suddenly, I generally happen to be locking remarkably well, and all
the symptoms that made me send for him (when, of course, he couldn't
come) have vanished. My idea of a doctor's visit is, that he should
find one moaning, groaning, and looking wretchedly pale: also, " unable
to touch a morsel," not, as CASPAR finds me, eating breakfast enough
for two, and enjoying it.
Happy Thought.—Apologise for being in such good health. CAPTAIN
DYNGWEÜ and DR. CASPAR, I perceive, know one another. They talk
about what has happened in DYNU WELL'S absence. It appears that
nothing has happened in his absence (which they expatiate upon to a
considerable extent), whereupon he puts his glass in his eye, and asks
after several "Cockalorums. [DR. CASPAR, and the Captain both use
glasses; the first invariably, the second cceasionally.] The Cockalorums
generally seem to be doing very well, judging from the Doctor's sta-
tistics, who is quite аи fait at DYNGWELL'S peculiar English.
"This Cove, says DYNGWELL, when the conversation has come to
a standstill, inclining his head sideways towards me, "has got the
regular rumti-iddities, papsylals, and pandenoodles all in one. Reg'lar
bad case—quite the invalid—give him something to rub in."
With which piece of medical advice he nods to both of us, and
lounges out of the room, observing that we shall meet at the table d 'hole.
Alone with the Doctor, and the remains of the breakfast. Short con-
versation. Serious moment. Peel that Frivolity has gone out with
DYNGWELL. Doctor examines me through his eve-glass, which seems a
sort of operation in itself. Decision soon arrived at; namely, that pro-
bably I've got rheumatic gout somewhere about me, ana that if I
don't know what's the matter with me now, I soon shall. "The
waters," DR. CASPAR explains, "will bring it out, whatever it is."
The summing up appears to me to be, "If you Ve come all the way
to Aachen without having something the matter, we '11 soon knock up
a disease for you, and you'll be as baa as anyone here in no time."
Doctor says I must begin the system to-morrow.
System— Rise at 6'30. Take the waters at the Eliaa Fountain. Take
a short walk: take this with the Concert in the garden. Take
another glass: take some more Concert. Return to hotel—light break-
fast—emphatically, light breakfast. I again apologise for to-day's ex-
cess in breakfast, and lay it on DYNGWELL.
System continued.—An hour and a half after breakfast take a bath:
stop in, twenty-five minutes. Return to hotel. Keep warm till dinner-
time at I'.'iO, when serve myself up at tabla d'hôte, hot.
Understand it all. Write it down. Determine to do it. Wonder
what win be the result. Wonder what /'•('// be the matter with me
when I 've gone through a course of the system.
Happy Thought.—If 1 don't like it, shall go home.
CASPAR being gone, I am not a man again. Remember suddenly lots
of things I ought to have asked him.
Make Л/ем* to ask him when we meet again. May I take cham-
pagne? or sherry? or both. If not, which, or what F How about
vegetable P How about tea and coffee F Will sugar hurt me P Will
milk make any difference? Where am I to get the waters? Where
is the Elisa Garden P Who gives the waters P Must one be a sub-
scriber to get the waters? If so—How much? If much—Can't I get
the waters somewhere else P What am I to do in the bath P What
am I to say when I go there P In what language am I to ask for a
bath P Will they know what I want?
Hafpy Thought.—Ask DYNGTVELL. When I ask him a few of these
questions, adding that I am going through the course, he observes,
interrogatively, What, my light-hearted invalid, coming out as the
perfect cure, eh?"
Must ask about learning German, Get a German professor. Quite
common, I suppose, a German professor.
Happy Thought.—If they 're swimming-baths, I could learn German
while swimming about with a professor in the water. DYNGWELL,
to whom I mention this as an idea, remarks that, as for swimming, of
course it depends how much, water I want for that, as the bath is only
about six feet by four. Still, it is a good idea.
Happy Thought.—The Doctor, who also dines at the taWe. d'lióte will
stop me if he sees me eating or drinking anything wrong. Can take every-

thing till stopped. Several English there—all invalids: also invalids
of various nations. DR. CASPAR points them out to me, so does DYNQ-
WKI.L. PYNGWÏLL tells me that the Cockalorum opposite me WM
quite a cripple when he came, but now, he says,. " he 's no end of a hand
at skittles. He nudges me (n""""T"TT '- "«'*«««—••"•**"»»•'i»«*«'
to remark the "rum coon nex
ful-looking elderly gentleman in spectacles. Captain informs me that
"he 's a Prussian Attorney in very good practice, which would be better
if he wasn't for four months in the year in a lunatic asylum. The
waters," DYÄGWELL adds, "are bringing it out of him," (bringing
what out of him ?—lunacy ?) "but he 's not all right yet; in fact he 'a
liable to be taken worse at any moment."
Happy Thought.—Shall change my seat to-morrow.
Dining is different in Prussia to anywhere else, I believe. We start
with soup and flab, as in England; after this I lose myself. Better
appear as if I was accustomed to this style of living.
Happy Thovght.—Take a little of everything. When I dine here
again shall know more about it. Besides if I'm wrong, Doctor wiU
stop me.
Result of this determination is, that having got clear of the soup and
fish, I find myself taking beef and jam (I think), chicken and cutlets,
salad and stewed pears, some sort of game very bitter, and pudding
and cheese on the same plate. "The whole to conclude," as the play-
hills say, "with the laughable farce of walnuts." Then coffee and
cigars. The Doctor doesn't stop me.
I can't help remarking »Mo voce to DYNGWELL, that it's a queer
sort of dinner. "You menu," says he, "it "s a queer sort of mixture
you've made of it." He explains that though the waiters hand round
these dishes quickly and together, yet it's only that everyone may
make a choice of what he likes. DYNGWELL says, "Never mind;
waiters will put it into you; waters will take it out of you." The
waters, according to DYKGWELL, will take everything out of you.
After dinner we all become conversational, inclining towards argu-
ment. The Skittler is introduced to me; the lunatic attorney retires
(thank goodness); a tall Englishman (who hasn't dined there) saunters
in and joins our end of the table. The theme of his conversation is
that he can dine somewhere in the town on a rumpsteak, eggs, and
beer for a shilling. Nobody denies it; and, apparently, nobody envies
him. An American moves his coffee-cup up to us, and wants to
know who's seen the paper to-day. No one has, and a lull takes place
in the conversation.
Happy Thought.—We get the English papers here.
Note.— When the Times arrives is uncertain: but it does come very
early in the morning. Much dishonesty is practised to get it at once. The
porter is entreated, the waiters are sent all over the hotel with indig-
nant messages from one person to another :ili nit. "keeping it so long."
DYNGWELL has craftily told the porter at the door, that, at whatever
hour of the morning the Times arrives, he is to come and wake him up
to read it. Consequently DYNGWELL is awoke, to have first look at
it: which operation, I ascertain, he performs,.^™/, by being angry at
having been roused; secondly, by getting half awake, and saying,
"Hey, what? the Cockalorum with the thingummy;" thirdly, by a
delay of two or three minutes, to discover "where his infernal eyeglass
has got to," which he finds somewhere over his shoulder, with one
string entangled in his whiskers; fourthly, to "shake himself to-
gether; " fifthly, to select one attitude for reading in bed less uncom-
fortable than another; and, lastly, to unfold the Times, confounding it
because it isn't cut, and asking, vaguely, "Why don't ¡hey cut it, hang
'em?" He just dashes through it. 1 observe, while craftily waiting in my
dressing-gown to take it to my own room, (and, perhaps, Happy Thought,
hide ¡t, which I admit is wrong,—but if I don't, and once go out,
there 'II be no more chance of seeing it for to-day) to him,—" Surely you
can't get much out of the Times that way?" He replies that he only
wants to see if they say anything about hm in it. It appears that they
don't, on any morning; which causes the Captain to use a vast
amount of strong language about the old Cockalorums at the Horse
Guards, through whom, it seems, he has got some transactions about
selling out, or purchasing in, or exchanging. 1 don't exactly under-
stand what he is so irate about, but, from his explanation, I conceive
that Commissions are not to be had for purchasing; or his isn't a good
one for selling; or that no one will exchange with him; or that the
fellow who said he would, wouldn't; or some other military difficulty.

OUR readers may remember a famous Irish epitaph, telling how a
certain lady
"Was bland, affable, and deeply religious."
That "she painted in water colour», was the nieoe of L.VUY JONES,
And of such is the Kingdom of Heaven."
That was making Heaven a place for the Upper Ten, which may be
considered doubtful theology. But the handbill we reproduce below,
shows us one of the Upper Ten doing his best to make it so.

beginning on tue 9th instant, on Sunday and Thursday Evenings, in a Place
of Worship, 'Consecrated' 'without hands,' by ' the Shepherd and Bishop
of Souls.' ¿if You are respectfully invited to attend."
Those who publish this remarkable appeal probably consider that if
one of the Upper Ten can get any considerable number of the Upper
Ten on the right road, they will be sure to draw after them that
numerous class of Englishmen, and Englishwomen, who, when the Upper
Ten do anything, love nothing so well as to " go and do likewise."
It is a cunning calculation. If only the Saobi of England could be
led from sin to salvation, what a harvest of souls there would be!
This must be considered by those who may be disposed to doubt
whether such a handbill is exactly in the spirit of that faith which we
are told is no respecter of persons, and who may doubt whether the
awakening qualities of a Gospel trump are likely to be enhanced by the
aristocratic quality of its metal.

How History repeats itself!
Of course you know the ancient story of the Irishman who declared
that somewhere iu the Mediterranean he had seen anchovies growing
on trees, the disbelief of his hearer, the duel, and the exclamation of
the Hibernian when told that his ball, which hit the other's shin, had
made him "cut capers." "0, bedad, my dear fellow, I beg you a
million pardons, I meant capers."
Dining at a very good man's very good feast last Thursday, the first
delicate whet, to enable us to enjoy his turtle, boiled pheasants and
celery sauce, dressed crab, snipes,, foie gras, and other simple necessaries,
was—an anchovy of exquisite flavour, curled round in a ring, with
three emerald capers in the centre.
On second thoughts, I don't see how this repeats history, but as I

question, the moral is the same. Ever yours

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ROME AND RAMSBOTHAM.
_ BAR MR. PUNCH,—It is so cold
here, that I can scarcely hold a
i pen. I should say the murky
m the glass must have gone
down some decrees below
sneezing point.
The Economical Consul is
still sitting; but sitting still,
except before a fire, is simply
perishing. As to what they're
doing inside, no one can tell;
and I have received so many
reports, that I am in a regular
state of contusion. However,
what I tcW. tell you, (as there
is nothing about the Great
Doctor being variegated just
at present) is a lot of particu-
lars about their References the
Elastics, now in Rome,—their
habits, their customs, and their manners genially. This, I am sure, will
be interesting to all ladies,—specially to those who belong to the Very
High, or Riddle Party, in our English Church, who are fond of senses,
Jezebels, coops, and like everything, or everybody, infested with the
elastic dignity. The Priests of different nations wear different dresses.
For instance, the French Elastic: he wears a black cossack, a sultan,
and a pair of rabbits round his neck, not unlike our clergyman's
banns, knee indispensaries and silk stockings, (what they call tardy
more,) shoes and buckles. What tue call our Big Churches, the
French call their Little Elastics,—that is, Abbeys. Out of doors some
wear large coalscuttle hats; but in Church all wear operettas, to keep
their tonsils warm. The tonsils are only worn by the Regular Clergy
(as a rule,) and are, you know, little round places shaved on the crown,
about the size of Ал^-a-crown. Why the Irregular Clergy are not
allowed to shave is clear, from their папе: but what a state of things,
when Roman Candlesticks can publicly own to a large number of
their Elastics being Irregular! It 's quite a candle to anybody.
The Bishops wear nitres, and coops all round them; also pictorial
crosses round their necks.
The Patriarchs are all here, and I thought they were dead long ago.
How History does lie! I saw a High Dilatory of the Easter
Church saying Mass. He was dressed in a Jezebel, which congealed
his surplus from sight; but I was told that he didn't wear a surplus,
but only a bulb, embroiled at the bottom with lace.
I heard ARCHBISHOP MANNING preach. They say he is a Doctor as
well as an Archbishop, and in very good practice; but how he finds
time to attend to two things puzzles me. But 1 suppose he has an
assistant to go his rounds in London while he 's away.
Talking of that. I hear that in England they are going to appoint a
few Suffering Bishops.
But to return. The Roman Bishops, who haven't any seas, are
called Bishops in Artichokes—why I don't know.
Everybody out of their pail is an errptic. I am one; but really if
the Riddle Commissaries at home are going to make altercations in the
old Church Service, and have a new Dictionary read from the decks on
Sunday instead of the well-known Lessons, I shall be inclined to
become a Roman Candlestick myself, or a member of some Dysentery
body.
The River Tiger has risen and gone back again. There was a fox-

NEW LEGAL DEPINITION,—A Copyholder.—L Compositor.
PUNCH'S SAUCE AND HARVEY'S MEDITATIONS.
SOME Conservatives have been holding festival at Newport, in the
Isle of Wight. The stars seem to have been chiefly Captains and
Parsons. Now Captains and Parsons have a perfect right to dine
together, and to make what they are pleased to think Conservative
speeches. Also a CAPTAIN HARVEY, one of the magnates, had an
entire right to say—
"Beceire then (he toast I have proposed to you with three euch cheers as
-lull be heard by our brother Conservative* at Byde—while the echoes,
perhaps, may waft them to Otborne, and they may fall, not ungratefully, on
the ears of our QUEEN, causing a throb of pleasure in her heart, for she will
feel them to be the cheers of her Conservative subjects, who earneitly hope
she may be spared for long years to reign over them.
The sentiment is that of a loyal soldier, so we will not dwell npon
the remembrance of a certain picture by a great artist (long dear to
Punch) who depicted a musical lodger playing a big drum and trumpet
in the next room to that of a sick neighbour, and alleging that the
sound might "soothe the invalid to a gentle slumber." Possibly, how-
ever, the plash of the sea-waves might be more agreeable to a delicate
Lady than the shouts of a lot of jovial Tories at dinner. Passing this,
Mr. Punch begs distinctly to deny CAPTAIN HARVEY'S right to distort
the original meaning of what he calls a famous old song. He was down
upon work-hating mobs," whose views he-described ш the following
quotation :—
"My eye! what jolly times for we.
We 'U swig all day, and live rent free,
And make them lords eat husk and bran,
And kiss the big toe of the small coal man."
These elegant lines are not from a famous old song, but from a squib
in the John Bull of old days. Written, Mr. Punch believes, by MR.
THEODORE HOOK, they were directed against no less distinguished ¡in
aristocrat than MR. LAMBTON, afterwards LORD DURHAM, whose coal-
properties and advanced creed were thus delicately satirised. He was
the Small Coal Man, and it was further stated that—
"He says that when he has control
He '11 make all things dog-cheap—but Coal,
And gin shall Sow in each man я can,
Says my prime little trump of a Small Coal Man."
More by token, the object of this elegant wit didn't like it, and
brought an action, and recovered damages. Mr. Punch is (in one
respect only) like unto a personage in a play by BEN JONSON. "When a
quirk or qniblin does 'scape thee, and i lion dost not watch and appre-
hend it, and bring it afore the Constable of Conceit, let them carry
thee out of"—thy easy chair, and seat thee at a Conservative meeting
of Captains and Parsons, shouting to the QUEEN.
SQUARE MEN IN ROUND HOLES.
"A LITTLE bird that can sing and won't sing mnst be made to sing,"
we used to be told in the nursery. But what if the little bird, or great
bird, can't sing P It is not worth its keep, unless for the table. But
you can't cook such a Goose as a Home-Secretary, or such a Booby as
a Chief Commissioner of Works. If the former is incompetent to
exercise his legal power of determining what fares cabmen may reason-
ably charge, and the latter cannot perform his proper function of
supe riut e ml in g public monuments, buildings, and parks from ignorance
of Art, send them about their business, or put them in places which
they are fit to fill :—
Neither AYRTON nor BRUCE,
We 11 call booby or goose,
But they both, where they 're posted, are sticks of no use
—and may, with all due respect to MR. GLADSTONE'S discernment, be
said to be Ministerial duffers.
Self-Help for the Labouring Classée.
"HELP yourself" is the pith of the advice now generally given by
speechifying politicians and statesmen to the working man that would
be if he could, but is unemployed for want of employment. "Help
myself P" may be conceived to be the reply. "You just put a leg
o' mutton and trimmins afore me, and see if I don't."

NEW CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE.
OLD LADY CORK, in her Reminiscences, tells us that BISHOP BUTLER
(a predecessor at Durham of BISHOP MALTBY) wrote Hudibras, with
an ever-pointed pencil, on the backs of his old lore-letters, at all sorts
of odd tunes—while waiting for hie dinner and his wig, in a hailstorm,
m a dentist's ante-
room, in stage-
coaches, on wet
Saturday afternoons,
and when lying
awake at night; for
the Bishop suffered
greatly from sleep-
lessness, and in vain
endeavoured to pro-
voke slumber by
repeating to himself
the names of all the
curates in his dio-
cese, by going
through the Thirty-
Nine Articles and
the great Councils
of the Church, and
by other professional
means.
RICHARDSON (the
Showman), who quit-
ted this country after
the massacre of St.
Bartholomew's,
wrote Clarissa Har-
loice in the intervals
between the perform-
ances, and dedicated
it to SIR CHARLES
GBANDISON, who had
just then joined SIR
ROGER DE COVERLEY
(coming from a dance
in the Add ¡son Road)
in establishing the
paper which still flou-
rishes under the name
of the Spectator. MR,
THOMAS JONES was
the first editor, ALEX-
ANDER SELKIRK and
the notorious BAH-
BIKGTON the foreign
correspondents, with
an occasional letter
from MB. L. GUL-
LIVEK, and BEAU
BRUMMBL and LORD
OeLEBY contributed
the fashionable intel-
ligence. CONGREVE
invested a consider-
able part of the for-
tune be had amassed
by his plays and rock-
eta in this new ven-
ture; and SIR GOD-
TREY LELY painted
for the Barber Sur-
geons the portraits
of all concerned in
the undertaking.
The original in-
ventor of steel-pens
was the founder of
Pen-Sylrania, which
he bought with the profits of his patent, and planted with mag-
num-bonums. Not the least useful of the "Century of Inven-
tions" was the celebrated Worcester Sauce, first devised by the
scientific Marquis in a dream, while attending the festival of the Three
Choirs in the city from whence he and his condiment derived their
title. To SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH we are indebted for the impervious
outer garment which will immortalise his name so long as it continues
to rain; and another article of dress, now but seldom seen, can be
traced back to SPENSER, the author of the Faerie Queen, and the first
President of the Royal Agricultural Society oí England. In the
library at Apothecaries' Hall there is a manuscript account, in cipher,
in the handwriting of PEPIS, of his discovery of Pepsine during a long
walk in the country.

the largest sum by

there is the curious
and unique misprint
of "A Midsummer

saying is.
Heigho, what can the reason

—might at present be sang
by a Spaniard of the gentler
sex in the character of her
Nation personified. Take
the foregoing snatch of song
as part of a provisional sub-
stitute for a Spanish Na-
tional Anthem.
WANTED,—A GENTLEMAN, of adult age, mature intellect, and poli-
tical and military knowledge and experience sufficient to enable him to
discharge the office of Constitutional Monarch of a newly emancipated
European State, formerly a First-rate Power, and capable, in competent
hands, of regeneration in the scale of Nations. A Liberal Allowance
will be given, with splendid Palace. Candidates desirous of obtaining
this situation are invited to manifest their ability to perform its duties
by submitting themselves to the ordeal of a Competitive Examination.
Applications for admission, with Testimonials, &c., to be addressed
to SERRANO, Madrid. N.B. Any Irish, unint'ected with Ultramon-
tane principles, may apply.
Might not an advertisement, such as that above sketched out, in-
serted in the leading European journals, possibly prove the means of
procuring a creditable occupant for the lone vacant throne of Spain?
There are, doubtless, many persons naturally fit to be Kings of Men,
who are at the same time ш lack of means, and of the employment for
which they are best adapted, and would be very glad to embrace an
opportunity of obtaining the Spanish Kingship on reasonable terms.

A MERITED COMPLIMENT.
MEMBERS of the Œcucomical Council have, we premise, no particu-
lar right to complain of Protestant sarcasm. If a Party gets up on the
top of a house, and bawls forth, "Mr. Punch will certainly go to Tar-
tarus," that gentleman, walking below, has surely a right to reply,
"You 're another." But we do not want to be unkind or disrespectful.
In that spirit of not wanting, we take leave to signify our approval of
the rule that in the Œcucomical debates, no speaker is to make the
slightest reference to what any other speaker has said. This is a little
like playing at draughts, with each player's men on different colours,
but no matter. It was a gentle and gentlemanly device to save the
feelings of the Fathers. ARCHBISHOP MANNING and BISHOP DUPAN-
LODP are skilled linguists as well as accomplished theologians, and
could fight their duello in half-a-dozen languages. But how much
could the Archimandrake of Laodicea understand of the Latin of
the Prophylactic of Hippopotames F Now all are on a level, and the
graceful thought that put them there deserves all praise.

And stand refuted by the dullest glutton,

ODE TO CONFIDENCE.
SWEET Confidence, of Gain, by Venture, child,
Scared hence by Speculation wild.
Fled, after lost Astrasa, to the skies,
Descend again on Britain's isle,
Bid trade revive, and traders smile.
Elated with increasing merchandise.
Send up the prices of our stocks and shares,
Afar from 'Change drive all the bears,
Make imports vast, and exports vastly more.
Cause artisans their strikes to cease,
The rate of Pauperism decrease,
And give employ to all who lacked before.
Stir timid Capital, with dauntless breast
In Irish projects to invest,
That PADDY may have something else to do
Than tumble, with a coward's shot,
His Landlord; may, with bettered lot,
Renounce sedition and the Fenian crew.
The Builder, Confidence, anew command
To rear, on waste unlovely land,
With enterprising view, abodes of men;
But, if thou move him to deface
One sylvan scene, one open space,
Then, Confidence, ascend to Heaven again.
France Marching On.
A SOCIAL révolution in France appeared to be suggested by the
practice, newly adopted amongst Frenchmen, of carrying revolvers.
It was, however, reassuring to hear that the middle classes in Paris
had put down attempted revolution with sticks.
MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
ENTER under a colonnade in front of a small garden. This is the
Elisa Garden. There is something peculiarly Heathen-Templish about
the pillars, about the steps down to the mysterious spring wnich comes
out of a lion's mouth in marble hot and hot, about the maiden of the
waters, and also about the water-seekers with their glass mugs of
various colours and dice-box shaped tumblers, that the idea crosses my
iiiiud (I have no one to tell it to, so it only crosses my mind, and then,
I suppose, re-crosses it) that we are engaged in some Pagan rite, and
that the Undine—[Happy Thought that, "Undine." Who was Undine F
Let me see: German legend. Undine and the Water-Spout; or the
lion. No. Think of this as I descend the steps slowly]—the Undiue
of the fountain is the High Priestess.
Happy Thought.—Elisa's fountain, and this is Miss ELISA.
We are in a curious atmosphere under these Pagan columns. Tliis
is the smell of the mineral springs. It might (the smell, I mean) be
produced, I imagine, artificially by stirring up a slightly stale egg with
a lucifer match until it boiled. In ten minutes' time one ceases to notice
it; though, at first, I think of writing indignantly to the Board of Works
at Aachen, and complaining of defective drainage. I left my Cottage
near a Wood on account of drainage, so it 's natural to be annoyed at
being followed by a smell. The cure, on this supposition, is homœo-
pathic. Here I am to take my first draught. I feel a little nervous.
Happy Thought,—Stand aloof to see what the other people do. Look
about.
Having descended the steps, I find myself, with two or three dozen
others, invalids of all nations—[.Happy Thought.—Good subject this

German, English, and French is being spoken freely; English, I
think, predominating. There are three languages that puzzle me: I
subsequently find they are Russian, Dutch, and Greek. The Dutch I
always thought was a rolling sort of tongue, so to speak ; but, on reflec-
tion, I fancy this idea was mainly founded upon the remembrance of
having heard "Oh, that a Dutchman's draught should be," by a bass
singer, late at night, years ago. (Hem. for Typical Developments.

Miss ELISA stands behind a semicircular counter, and is rapid, sure,
and business-like in all her movements. I put forward my hand to her
with my tumbler in it. She looks at me for a second or so. Not to
see what I want, but because (I found this out afterwards on being
accustomed to the scene) I am new to her. She is very pretty; I
should like to say in good German to her, "Gretchen, my pretty one,
wilt Thou give me some of the tepid and limpid Stream that rushes
from the Lipn's Mouth F" I am sure I understand thoroughly the
German spirit, if I only knew the language.

don't yet know what the German for "if you please" is, and Wauer
slone, that is, Wasser neat—\Happy Thought.—Wasser neat. Good.
Full of Happy Thoughts this morning: eftect of air and early rising]—
sounds rude and abrupt; and, worse than all, sounds so insular.
Happy Thought.—Talking of insular, when I get in with some Ger-
mans, students and professors, for instance, I must ask 'em how they
like being without a Navy. Curious, a nation without any admirals, or
jolly tars; but then, after all, they 've got their mineral waters.
ELISA catches the water in my tumbler, jerks it out, catches some
more, and hands it to me, smiling. Wish I knew what "thank you" is.
Happy Thought.—Say "Lanky" It sounds like good German, and I
shouldn't be much surprised to hear that it is. On second thoughts,
yes, I should be surprised. How difficult it must be to invent a lan-
guage. This leads to deep thought5 and will occupy me while I stand
Happy Thought.— Epicures say that, to make a perfect salad, you
ought first to soupçonner the bowl with a shalot. Mineral Wasser to
the taste is as if you'd cleaned out the tumbler with lucifer matches of
the old blue-tip school. It 's what I should expect that water at the
Polytechnic to be like after it has been flavoured by an experimental
blowing up of the Royal George under water, by the Diving Professor,
or some other scientific gentleman connected with the establishment.
(I don't know whether this goes on now; it used to. But that's the
idea.)
Happy Thou p ht— Got half through tumbler. Nothing happened to
me as yet. Nothing 's happened to any one that I can see. All chat-
tering in little knots and groups and coteries. Regardless of their
doom, the little victims drink.
Happy Thought.—Finished tumbler, all but a quarter of an inch
depth of water at the bottom. Don't know what to do with it.
Wonder why I've an objection to the last drop? Instinct, somehow.
Happy Thought.—Gn and hear the band.
I see everyone leaving a quarter of an inch, or so, of water in their
tumblers, and then turning it out into two little receptacles, like the
lower part of umbrella stands, placed at the corner of the stairs. Do
this also. Just as if 1 'd been doing it all my life.
Happy Thought.—That 's where I feel myself beyond DYNGWELL or
CA/.BLL or CHILVERN and MILBURD, and so forth. I am, I feel, cosmo-
politan. In a second, by just turning this tumbler topsy-turvy, I
feel myself, as it were, free of the place. A walk in the garden, hear
the band, another tumbler (this sounds like dissipation and the bottle,
but it isn't—it 's only high, airy, breezy spirits before breakfast, ana
sulphur mixed), and I shall be naturalised.
Somehow 1 feel, having finished my glass, that I am de trop here; for
everyone is talking to everyone else—quite a family party. All know
one another, and are perpetually nodding and bowing, and smiling and
smirking, and inquiring after healths, and "what you did last night
after we left," and "whether you 're going to So-and-so to-day," and
so forth. I fe«l that I am isolated. Wish FRIDOLTNE was here.
Should like to have her here—to talk to. (Mem. Isn't this selfish?
l s the real use of a wife only to be talked to when you don't know any-
body else? Note for psychological inquiry. Plenty of time for psycho-
logical inquiries, if I don't know anyone here except DYNGWELL.) I feel,
besides this sense of isolation, a desire to speak to somebody—to throw
myself into their arms, and unbosom my pent-up emotions. I haven't
an idea, on reflection, what my pent-up emotions are like, or what I
should say if anyone—for instance, that little Frenchman (who 's taken
three tumblers to my one in the same time)—stepped forward, and
said, "Me void! unbosom yourself !" I don't think I should know what
to do. I should set him down, speaking rationally, as mad. Stop! I
pull up. This burning desire for conversation, this hysterical yearning,
of course, I see, it is the effect of the sulphur. Sulphur. I must tone
myself down again.
Happy Thought.—Bow to Miss ELISA (who seems to notice it asan
impertinence; sulphur again—1 suppose tbere was a lurking some-
thing in my eye), and ascend steps. Stroll into the garden. People
walking up and down rather fast. I walk up and down, round and
round. There 's only one path, and you do it in different ways. There
are two others, I discover afterwards, but they are short and retired.
It is very exhilarating: it isn't Cremorne; it isn't Vauxhall; it isn't
Mabille; it isn't Hyde Park; it isn't the seaside ; it evidently isn't
Tivoli (where I 've never been); but it's—Happy Tltought—it's exactly
what the indosure in Leicester Square miff ht be made into, without the
present ruined statue, and with mineral waters coming out of the
pump.
Mem.—Recommend this to the Board of Works. My statue, eques-
trian, as a benefactor.
1 feel inclined to suggest supper somewhere, and regret stopping up
so late. I also have a sort of notion that later in the day the thousand
additional lamps will be hung up. (Sulphur again.) There is a pond
with two sorts of fish—red. and not red. Sulphur water, I suppose,
and sulphur has taken the colour out of some of the weaker ones, or those
that have been in the longest. Good band. Pretty faces. There is a
Dutch young lady (I hear some one say she is Dutch) to whom I
should like to talk—only because she is Dutch. Is this incipient
libertinism, or only sulphur P Or is the former the effect, the latter the
cause?
Happy Thought.—DON JUAN ended, operatically, in sulphur. Good.
"Orphée aux Enfers" Quadrilles just played. Appropriate. Will
go down during the entr'acte (it is a quarter to eight A.M.), and take
another sulphur. Descend. Fewer people there. I want another
tumbler, please. More difiBcult to ask when there 's not a crowd, as
what you say can be heard. Approach ELISA. She is very pretty.
(Sulphur.)
Happy Thought,—Say "Mair wasser." Scotch is an excellent substi-
tute for German. After all, it isn't so much the language itself, but the
spirit of it, which is the great thing to catch.
Note.—That idea of the difficulty of inventing a language is worth
enlarging upon. Suppose one had to do it. What should I have
called a cup? I don t think anything would have suggested " cup"
to me, unless it was done suddenly by a happy thought. Or e д., hat,
or handkerchief, or neck, mhead. "Head" seemsreally difficult. Who
would have thought, without having a name for it ready to hand, of
calling a head a " head"?
A man couldn't have called his own head a head ; but another man—
a friend, for instance,—must have done it. Perhaps he did it offen-
sively at first, and meant it as an insult; and then gradually it settled
down into an every-day name. Odd occupation, when you come to
think of it, for two people, sitting down, and having nothing else to
do, saying to each other, "Now, what shall we call this?"—a hand,
for instance,—like a game of forfeits. Then, after some delibera-
tion, friend says,
Happy Thought—CsXL it hand.
Happy Thought.—People who call a spade a spade. I never
thought of it before, but he must have been a very clever fellow
who dit first call a spade a spade. He might have called it a bonnet,
and he wouldn't have been wrong then; that is, if bonnets weren't
made before spades.
*** I review this at night in my note-book, and set it down to sul-
phur acting suddenly on the system. DYNGWELL said "the waters
would bring it out of me, whatever it was." Something's coming out.
But what is it? I can t help being nervous. Shall tell CASPAR to-
morrow, and write down my symptoms.
HOW TO CLASSIFY YOUR CABMEN.
SOMEBODY has suggested that cabs should be, like railway trains,
constructed in three classes: and that the first class should be painted
white, and charge a shilling a mile, while the second, blue, charge
ninepence, and the third should charge but sixpence, and be painted
yellow. Now this is not a bad notion, only Cabby would, we fear, be
frequently found subject to a fit of colour blindness, and especially at
nightfall, would demand a white class fare, although there really were
no colourable pretext for his doing so. Suppose then that his colour be
extended to his costume, which might be serviceably done, without
putting him in livery. Were every first-class cabman to appear in a
white liât, and a white waistcoat and white gloves, he would look
certainly distinguí, and be readily distinguished.
For Cabmen of the second class a plain blue suit would serve, and
they might further be remarkable Ъу the wearing of blue spectacles.
Cabmen of the third class might be dressed in the costume which is
most in fashion now on all our London cab-stands; that is to say, they
might array themselves precisely as they pleased, so long as they con-
trived to make themselves appear the most unpleasant objects possible.
WINE AND ELECTRICITY.
A FRENCH savant has discovered that wine may be made old by
electricity. Chemists who are also wine-merchants (the trades too
often are identical), may be glad to be informed in what way to
apply it :—
"The wires of the voltaic pile should bo tipped with platinum, to which
must be attached electrodes of the вате metal. Dip both into the liquid und
yo« will precipitate it, and produce premature age."
Stingy people, who play havoc with their friends' digestive organs,
will be doubtless ready purchasers of "choice electro-crusted port," or
"fine old cheap voltaic claret." But we should hope all honest folks
would feel electrically shocked at such a dangerous experiment. Cheap-
ness in vinous drinks goes usually with nastiness; and it is surely not
improbable that wine which has been prematurely aged by means of
electricity may tend towards producing premature age in the drinker.
PROBABLE.—What the Cab Proprietors will soon find it, if the new
arrangement is carried out—A Flagging Trade.

tlemen!
Prosecute poor DEMETRIO
PAPPA, late Manager of the
Oriental Commercial Bank,
for embezzlement of a few
thousands, with such a set
of Directors' accounts as
the Official Liquidator disclosed at the last hearing of the case !—
"Ma. HENKT SPICEB, a Director of the bank, had owed £3000 or £4000 on
313 shares, which he had compromised by the payment of £600; MR. SKTON,
another Director, owed about £6000 on 413 snares, and had paid nothing.
Mu. EDMOND CLENCH, a Director, owed about £15,000 on 996 shares, and had
paid £3000 in cash and given up £4000 worth of bills of the bank, worth
about 14«. in the pound; MB. SWANN, a Director, who had become a bank-
rupt, owed about £10,000 on 612 shares, and had not paid a penny; MB.
Ы-KBNZIE, a Director, now dead, owed about £12,000 on 650 shares, and had
paid nothing; ADMIRAL BUBNEY, £7,000 or £8,009 on 487 shares, and had
paid nothing. The Admiral, however, had registered a deed of assignment of
everything in favour of his creditors. There was an immense number of
shareholders who did not pay: thirty of them bore the same surname as the
defendant."
Evidently DEMETRIUS' way of doing business was the rule, not the
exception, m this Pappœ family of the Oriental Commercial. When
"Greek met Greek" in that bank parlour, there came not " the tug of
war," but the tug for the sinews of war,—the "tug" at the purse-
strings of depositors, in which Manager and Directors seem to have
taken the most fraternal share. Poor ADMIRAL BURNEY, the Chairman
of the Board, is to be pitied: he has given up all he has to hia creditors.
Here is his piteous story :—
"The general transactions of the bank were conducted in the Greek lan-
guage, and it was utterly impossible to know what was going on. Long letters |
were received by the bank in Greek, and he, as Chairman, wanted to have
them translated, but the charge for that was so great (£10 a letter, he believed)
that the proposal wai abandoned."
The business was evidently all Greek to the Admiral, who was never
so completely at sea as when he embarked on board the good ship
Oriental Commercial, DEMETRIO PAPPA Commander. But if the
Manager is to stand in the Dock for " rigging" the market, shouldn't
he be supported by a respectable body of Directors for "wrecking " the
shipf DEMETRIUS only took the Company's money to keep up the
price of shares. The Directors took the Company s shares without
paying any money whatever. There can't surely be so much difference
m the cases.

A SENSIBLE FASHION.
IT is not very often that I give myself the trouble to read the non-
sense which is written every month about the fashions. Still leas often
can I find there a grain of common sense, so well worth finding as the
following :—
"The manteau de cour, which at present composes the robe de grand
toilette, is a most useful combination, as it forms two dressée out of one.
If I were burthened (I mean blessed) with a wife and daughters
dear (I mean to say expensive), how I should clap my hands and
shout at such intelligence as this !" Two dresses put of one 1" What
a happy thought for a mother to conceive and directly carry oat! I
declare, were I a father (which I happily am not), I would make my
wife a present of a " manteau de cour," on condition that she wore it
as a pattern for her girls. If they were hence to learn the art of
making their own dresses, in such manner as to make two dresses out
of one, what a mint of money should I annually save!
Leaving you and others to act upon the hint, I remain in single-
mindedness, yours most sincerely,

A WRITER in the Pall Mall describes Ireland as being in course of
rapid assimilation, in character, manners, and customs, to London. It
would be a pity if PADDY were to lose all his old picturesque and

change, in acquiring the loyalty distinctive of the " London Irish."

THAT largest-winded of all Gales—"the Tornado"—though three Foreign
Secretaries in succession have allowed it from time to time to roar you as gently
as any sucking dove i" yea, "to roar you an 'twere any nightingale "—is not
yet disposed of. The last we hear of it, we are sorry to say, is in connection with
the slip unsatisfied claims of the luckless crew. Their case, it should be remem-
bered, is distinct from all question between the owners and the Spanish Govern-
ment.
There is no doubt that the men were robbed of their money, clothes, and other
private property, to the amount of more than £1093. There are the affidavits of
the men to prove it. backed by the testimony of the British Consul at Cadiz, who
often visited the unlucky fellows in their prison, and helped to clothe their naked-
ness. He has borne witness that none of the chronometers, watches, money,
nautical instruments, or other articles of private property belonging to officers or
men were ever restored to them.
Besides this spoliation, the hapless crew endured six months' painful and rigorous
captivity, part of the time in irons, during which captivity some of them received
injuries which shortened their days. And now the Spanish Government has the
assurance to offer these men, en bloc, £1500 by way of compensation, an amount
which, deducting the amount they were robbed of, leaves each able seaman about
£4 3*. 6rf., or, as MB. FORBES CAMPBELL;—who is still sticking to the case, we
are glad to say. like a Scotch terrier—pithily puts it, "a little more than one
month's wages for six months' imprisonment."
Now, Spain may be in difficulties, but that is no reason why England should
allow sailors of hers to be first plundered, imprisoned, and ill-used, and then dis-
missed with the merest mockery of compensation.
If these had been men of a different class, we are much mistaken if such a long
time would have been allowed to elapse before adequate reparation was insisted
uiKin. Let LORD CLARENDON look to it—that "the Tornado" is not allowed to
blow over in this very unsatisfactory fashion.

[JANUARY 29, 1870.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO TOM HUGHES, M.P.
MY DEAR ТОН,
You are one of PuncKt old friends. You have written the
truest and manliest book extant on English public-school life. In all
that yon have published, and in most that you have talked, you have
upheld pluck, straightforwardness, the calling of spades spades, and
tin- recognition that men, whether gentle or simple, are. on the whole,
made of the same clay, pulled by the same strings, worthy of the same
rights, and liable to the same duties. Yon hare more than once told
the truth, where it wasn't at all relished, and made against your imme-
diate popularity,—as when you came down over the knuckles of certain
rogues of small tradesmen in Lambeth for their fraudulent weights and
measures. Holding you in respect for all these things, I am sorry to
linvi! to pluck a crow with you for certain mischievous nonsense you
have been talking lately at a Southwark election meeting.
You were there to support MR. GEORGE ODGER—"the 'working
man' candidate." Now I must confess to a want of faith in candidates
who come forward on the strength of belonging to this or that order,
connection, or interest. It doesn't matter much to me whether it 's
"the working man's candidate" or "the idle man's candidate," "the
public house candidate," or "the chapel candidate," "the landlords'
candidate," or " the labourers' candidate." But of all the cants of the
day, the "working man" cant is about the most sickening to me.
And Southwark has had a more than usually strong dose of it this
election. The " hard-handed " business has been worked till we want
a good deal of the "hard-headed" business to take the taste of it
out of our mouths. And you should be one of the doctors to adminis-
ter the tonic. But, instead of steel, you give us ipecacuanha—the
"working man mixture" as before—in the shape of such rot as this :—
"There wa« a great contempt for hard work here, as there was in the
Southern SUtee of America, although people scarce dare show it. They must
knock that nonstmse out of the British public, and teach them that the only
thing that wa> really honourable in this world was good hard work. (Cheers.)
Ho believed this to be thoroughly a working man's borough; and whether the
electora returned a working man now or not, they might depend the thing
would be done before another year waa over."
Now, my dear Том. what sort of a borough, in the name of common
sense, is a thoroughly working man's borough P" One where the
opinion of working men is strong enough to swamp that of all other
classes? Do you think that a verv desirable kind of borough, as
things go P And how could you talk that rubbish about " contempt
for hard, work F" You know perfectly well that there is no such
thing, except among fools and fribbles, and you don't suppose there
are more of them in England than there used to be, do you? To be
sure, "snobs " are a serious fact, and a specially English growth. And
they may think work " low." But, surely, when you talk of "hard
work," you don't mean to say that the hard work deserving of most
respect, or most qualifying men either for electing or being Members
of Parliament, is the material "hard work" of handicraftsmen,
labourers, and mechanics P
When you wind up by hoping that Southwark " will set an example
to all England by returning a working man," do you mean that " all
England ought to return "working men?" Supposing ODGER to
be a Phœnix, are such Phoenixes kept in stock P Could " all England"
find Odgers at need P Don't you think a House of Commons all
Odgers would be rather like an apple-pie all quinces?—a House of
{/»commons, in fact.
You say, "most of the great questions coming before Parliament are
working men's questions. That may be. But does it at all imply that
working men are the likeliest to find the answers to them P You in-
stanced Compulsory Education. "Was the meeting for that P" you
asked. Then some cried " Yes," and some " No."
"Well," you said, "that very difference of opinion in the meeting
was an excellent reason why working men should get into the House of
Commons." Why P "Because it was a question which deeply affected
the working men of this country."
I should пате expected another " because "—" because working men
knew most about the question, and were best able to settle it."
Then you went on :—
"There were many other public questions in which the working man waa
very much interested—for inatance, the question of Direct Taxation. He knew
that working men were very much in favour of direct instead of indirect taxa-
tion. He was of the same opinion, and this question must very soon come
before the House of Commons, and it would be of the greatest benefit that
there should be working men to discuss it. (Cheer».) Then there was the
question of the administration of the Poor-Law, because pauperism was be-
ginning to eat out the heart of this country, and it was placing increased
burdens upon the people, and therefore it was absolutely necessary that men
should represent the people who thoroughly understood their wants, and who
had a perfect knowledge of the wishes of the people."
Certainly; who denies, who doubts it? Bat, my dear Тон, the
Question is, do "working men," even the Odgers among them,
thoroughly understand the wants and wishes of the people —even
of their own class—even of their own trades P
You must see, I think, that you have been talking not only nonsense,
but mischievous nonsense— nonsense that is quite unworthy o! you,
however natural in the mouths of a conceited class of ignorant.
young fellows in fustian jackets, who are far fonder of calling them-
selves working men than of working— who spend more tin,- e in the
public-house than the shop, and are greater " dabs " with their tongues
than their tools.
If you knete you were talking nonsense, I am very angry with you.
If you didn't, I am very sorry for yon. But that you ven talking
nonsense, is past a doubt. And so 1 think you will admit when yon
come to think it over, by the light of this letter from your faithful
old friend,
CHAEITT AND COOKERY.
IT is thought a foolish thing to quarrel with one's bread-and-butter.
But there are times when such a quarrel is hardly to be wondered at,
as for instance when a man gets very little bread to eat, and hardly
ever any butter. This is not unseldom the condition of tue labourer,
and, to aggravate the fact that he gets scarce enough to eat, there is
the fact that what he gets is sadly wasted in bad cookery.
"The benighted state of the agricultural labourer's wife is almost a hope-
less one. She cannot vary the sickening narrow round of dishes which twelve
shillings a-week provide for her husband and children. Bread, cabbage,
bacon, potatoes, are the four articles she buys. Soup is unknown to her. The
artisan's wife is fully as ignorant. Where these go half-fed, the French
housewife would prosper."
How to make the pot boil is with many a poor labourer, a
vastly puzzling problem; and his wife is quite as puzzled to find out
what to put in it. A French peasant can make soup, and a score of
toothsome dishes, while an English one can only serve up half-boiled
cabbage and potatoes. In England, soup is an unheard-of luxury with
coll afjers; in France, and elsewhere on the Continent, no peasant
dines without it. A basin of hot soup is surely a more palatable and
more nutritions meal than a scrap of bread-ana-cheese, or a morsel of
fat bacon. The Examiner says truly :—
"The charity which introduces a new cheap food to the working poor, or
teaches them how to husband the heat and muscle, the carbon and the fibrin,
which they have been throwing away in waste for во many yea», ifl one of
capital importance."
There are many schemes in view for national education, and many
hobbies will be mounted to ride in that direction when Parliament
next meets. Haply some one may be bold enough to move that cook-
ing classes shall be added to our schools, and that besides learning to
read, to write, to cipher, and to sew, poor girls shall be instructed in
the art of making soup. And perhaps ere the next century some one
may be bold enough to move that no certificate of marriage shall be
granted, where a certificate of cookery cannot be produced.
A NOMINAL OBSTACLE.
A WRITER in the Daily News comments agreeably on the difficulty
of finding names for the new theatres, which are now so constantly
being built, and makes one or two suggestions on the subject. We,
too, have a little something to suggest. We have the Gaiety. Why
not also the "Gravity P" What name could bemore suitable for a theatre
to be devoted mainly to the performance of the serious drama—if
there exists lessee or manager bold enough to undertake such a
venture? Again, a house abandoned to light comedy, farce, operetta,
and burlesque, would not be inappropriately "appellated" (we make
an offering of this word to the American press) the "Bagatelle." We
have not been to Stationers' Hall to register either of these names, and
generously place them at the disposal of all theatrical "enterprisers"
(something more for America) and speculators.

ROMAN LAMBS AND ROMAN SHEPHERDS.
AMONG the recent Roman ceremonies described by "Oar Own"
Council Correspondents, not the least pretty and significant is that of
St. Agnes. Before the altar of her Basilica, in the Nomentan Way, are
blessed two little lambs, whose innocent mutton figures afterwards on
the POPE'S own dinner-table—the Pope's-eyes of their respective legs
twice as large and lustrous, we presume, as usual—and out of whose
fleeces are woven the pallia sent by the Holy Father to Patriarchs,
Archbishops, and certain favoured Bishops.
We are told how the pretty animals are brought in, bound, on crim-
son silk cushions, their mouths tied up with red ribbons, to prevent
bleating. What wonder if scoffers persist in seeing in them a symbol
of the Romish episcopate—in Council assembled—gracefully disposed
on the cushions of their aula, but bound all the time in the chains of
MONSIGNORE FESSLER, and gagged by the vow of silence and secresy,
which some of them have lately been " wigged" for breaking.

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHAEIVARI
[FEBRUARY 5, 1870.
AMERICAN SLANQOGRAPHY.

EOPLE who have any rever-
ence for "the pure well of
English undefilcd,' must
wish that the Americans
would let that well alone,
and not deflle it with suca
hideous corruptions as the
ollowing :—
"One of the papers lately,
instead of recording that the
President had gone on an ex-
cursion, simply announced
that he had ' excurted.' The
other day wo read that ' Erie'
was injuncted. A paragraph
in an evening paper was
beaded thus — 'A woman
Burgled Nine Times in Ten
Years.'"
Fancy the dismay of dear
old DR. JOHNSON at reading
such uncouth phraseology
as this! Imagine him de-
vouring Yankee newspapers
for breakfast! With how
many a cup of tea could he
gulp down, without choking,
their grammarless contents!
And when afterwards dis-
cussing them in critical cold
blood, with what rotundity of phrase would he give vent to his just
wrath. Conceive the Great Lexicographer admitting to his Dic-
tionary such excrescencies as: "Burgle, verb active, To break into a
dwelling-house," or, "Excurt, verb neuter, To со upon a journey."
What groans, and grunts, and snorts of furious indignation he would
forcibly emit on meeting with a sample of New English such as this:
"We have interviewed the cuss who quilled our yester's Editorial,
and in this connection we may bigtype our assurance that the news
which had been wired to us was regular reliable, as our reporters are
injuncted from letting slide our reputation by telegramming fibs."
Assuredly, if speech be silver, men who coin such phrases, which
indeed should never become current, ought to be indicted for uttering
false money. As a set-off to their claim for Alabama compensation,
our Yankee friends should pay us for the injuries inflicted on the
English language by word-inventing writers for the Trans-Atlantic
Press.
THE MAN OF APRIL AGAIN.
LET Louis NAPOLEON no more be called "The Man of December."
He has now become a Constitutional Sovereign. Before he got con-
nected with December he had achieved celebrity in relation to another
month. He might then have been called The Man of April."
England will never forget that he turned put on the 10th of April,
1848, as a Special Constable, to aid in quelling rioters in London. He
cannot have forgotten it himself, and might now consider whether
rioters in Paris would not be best put down as he helped to put down
the Chartists. Only the other day fie said, "I will answer for order."
He spoke in the spirit, of a Special Constable. No doubt he has always
been a Special Constable at heart. The respectable people of Pans,
turning out with sticks the other day to crush insurrection, have shown
him what to do. He has simply to swear them all in as Special Con-
stables, put staves in their hands, and take a leading truncheon in his
own, as their High Constable. Then Louis NAPOLEON will be himself
again. Now he has given France constitutional liberty, the whole
rational world will applaud him for employing any amount of police-
force, with the help of bludgeons even, that may be necessary to make
professional or crazy seditionists, who obstruct the path of progress,
move on.
Chemical News.
IT is stated that "iodide of potassium supplies the simplest test of
the presence of the poison likely to be found in hair-dyes and other
such compounds." There has been so much artificial treatment of
ladies' hair lately, that the term "iodide" has again and again been in
the mouth of the wearied and wondering spectator, but with a slight
variation of spelling, taking the form of "Heigho! dyed!"
THE TOLLBAR-KEEPER'S PAEADISE,—The Langdale Pikes.
A SABBATOMANIAC SAWNEY.
THE Globe, announcing the establishment, after much opposition, of
a morning and evening Sunday train to run between Glasgow and
Paisley, thus records a scandalous example of the Sabbatomama which
ravages the Kirk of Scotland, and causes its victims to make themselves
ridiculous :—
"Nothing can be more satisfactory than the behaviour of the passengers in
the train run between Glasgow and Edinburgh, and vice versa on Sunday
morning and evening, and vet on the first Sabbath on which the train waa
started the passengers were greeted by a preacher at the Edinburgh terminus,
who assured them that they were hastening to a certain place at the rate of a
penny a mile."
But what were the railway authorities or attendants about to allow
such a Sabbatomaniac as this on their platform? They, indeed, may
consider him a harmless lunatic, but no lunatic, or maniac, can be pre-
sumed to be harmless. Nobody can define the extent of the brain-
disease which causes mania, Sabbatomania equally with any other.
Even if it were definite and determinable, it would be liable, at
any moment, to exacerbation. There is no limiting the irritation
which may be excited by a bee in the bonnet, and that excited by the
Sabbatarian bee is apt to be particularly violent. The minister who is
frantic enough to accost passengers alighting at a terminus on a Sun-
day, and inform them that they are travelling to the other terminus
above alluded to at the fare mentioned, must be very far gone. If the
Edinburgh railway people neglect to turn him out of their premises
when he comes there raying, they will have him, some Sunday, throwing
himself under the engine, or, what will be worse, throwing somebody
else.
Perhaps, however, this rampant Minister is not insane, but only a
very ignorant fool, who does not understand what he has read. Pos-
sibly he may be some ranting preacher, converted pugilist, coalheaver,
S.S., or something of that sort. But then the proper platform for him
is that of his own meeting-house, and not the railway, whence he
ought to be removed by the police whenever he presents himself,
attempting to annoy respectable people.
A CHECK UPON THE TRADE CHEATS.
TRADES-PEOPLE, as a rule, are fond of being advertised, and of having
their names prominently brought before the public. But we never
feel inclined so much to aid them in this matter, as when we chance to
stumble on such paragraphs as this :—
"At the Newington Petty Sessions no lèse a number than fifty-five South
London tradespeople were summoned for using unjust weights and measures,
and the total of the fines inflicted amounted to seventy-two pounds."
Considering that such rascals chiefly cheat the poor, who in this
hard weather are hardly clad or fed, we regret much that the only
pillory now extant is the pillory of the press. The paltry fines which
are imposed are wholly insufficient to punish or deter men from repeat-
ing such offences. Some good might be done, perhaps, to villains of
this sort, by parading their names prominently, not merely in the
newspapers, but on every dead wall and hoarding in the neighbour-
hood of their respective shops. Even the pavements might be utilised
for giving due publicity to scamps who sell short weight. Poor people
might be cautioned to "BEWARE OP BOTCHER BUGGINS!" whose
address might be appended in letters a foot long; or they might be
warned from dealing with "BiNKS THE BLACKGUARD BAKER!"
whose offence might be placarded in the very blackest ink. To make
the punishment complete, these announcements should be made at the
expense of the offenders, who should be compelled to act as their own
bill-stickers, and post such placards prominently in front of their own
Domestic Police.
AN American paper relates that a MR. COATES, at New York, was
found by the police in the streets with a pair of handcuffs on. They
naturally took him for an escaped criminal, and locked him up. It
turned out, however, that he had only broken loose from home, where,
during a fit of intemperance, he had been handcuffed by MBS. COATES.
MR. COATES has had peculiar experience of the bonds of wedlock.
Astronomical.
POOR Mrs. Malaprop! Having read in her Pocket-Book that the
Eclipse of the Moon would be visible at Greenwich," she made a
special journey to the "Conservatory" there from her comfortable
home at Hcxton, firmly believing that at Greenwich only should she
be able to witness the sight!

FEBRUARY 5, 1870.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
ROME AND RAMSBOTHAM.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
NOTHING bas perspired since my last, and so as a means of
amusement and destruction, I have been getting my niece JULIA to
read to me the history of the earliest Consuls of the Church. For the
benefit of your readers I have made some notes while JULIA was doing
this, which I will send to you, adding them to the present letter, in
which 1 must, however, first dilute upon what is going on here.
By the way, in my last I made some illusions to what the Riddle
Commission is doing at home. I do hope, even if they touch the
Dictionary, that they^ll let alone the Colics. It seems to me they are
sapling the pillows of the great cambric of truth. But to return.
The Economical Consul is still the centaur of detraction here, and
will be for some time. The Consul of Trent sat for nearly eighteen
years; how stiff they must have been!
The rule is that so many are set down to speak, but they stand up,
and speak without being set down. A Carnaval subsides in the chair,
and rings a bell when he doesn't want anything, at least so I 'm told.
This Carnaval, I fancy, is a Delicaie-a-laiterly. There will be concus-
sions on the POPE'S Syllabub and Bicycle—quite "wheels within
wheels," as the prophet says.
CARNAVAL BARN ABT is appointed chief of the Commissaries sitting
on Rides and Cemeteries: he is instead of another Camaval who is
¿¿appointed.
Every day there is a great elastic fungus to be seen in some church
or another, and on certain state occasions there are deceptions at the
Vacuum.
An eminent Dilatory, Roman Candlestick of course, has been telling
me a great many things about their doctorings and cemeteries that
I didn't know before: for instance, the POPE alone can grant indul-
gences, but he can't indulge himself without the permission of his
Confectioner, for he goes to confection regularly, and oftener, like the
poorest of them, and has to perform his pennants just the same.
Also, they have seven Orders, where English Protestants have only
three. Their orders are Bishops, Priests, 13eacons, Exhausters (these
are preachers, I suppose), Ostriches (same as our pew-openers, only
men), Aconites (who hold candles), and Lictors. I think I 've got 'em
all correct, though I only quoit from memory. Then there are also
the Mannikin Orders, but these are Monks and Fires. You recollect
the " Fire of Orders Grey?" That 's it. There are various officious
people connected with the Elastic State to whom one gets accus-
tomed in Rome, if you decide here for any time.
The Interior Clergy are divided into two glasses—the Regular (which
I have mentioned before) and the Irregular, or the Sickly Clergy. The
Sickly Clergy do the Parish work, and can live how they like; some
live together in Immunities Luce the Omelettes of SAU CHABLIS, or the
Oratorios, of HANDEL I thought, until I heard they were SAM PHIPPS'S
Oratorio«.
There are also the Knights Tumblers, and the Knights of Mortar,
both millinery orders. There are Holy Fires of all sorts of colours, ana
I must not omit the Fires Minima with their peculiar crotchets, though
all hold the same tenants.
The Monks live in Monstrosities; and the Nuns are clustered. They
are all very good people in their way, specially the Scissors of Charity,
who attend the poor and the sick, and do everything "Connemara," as
the Irish say. bo, too, do the Scissors of Mersey, from Liverpool, I
believe. Most of these aforesaid take oaths, but a great many don't
take their oaths to anything.
The music in the Roman churches in general is not of the flurried
Italian, but most depressive. I don't like Gregarious Chance myself,
as a ride, but sometimes they are very fine. Women's voices you
don't hear here, but only those of male canisters, generally boys and
men,
The POPE'S confident, I am told, is AUNT O'NiLLT. I can't help
fancying that I must have got this name wrong, as I also hear that
AUNT O'NELLY is not only an Italian (which the name isn't), but also
a Carnaval and a Beacon. This is very curious, but everything is fuU
of such mistress here, that one is at one's wits ends to lather to the
bottom of all one hears. When I know more of this, I 'II tell you.
I am promised an introduction to FATHER SICKY, who is the Great
Astonishcr here, as MR. HIND is at home. FATHER SICKY has a
Conservatory ever so high up, and a magnificent stethescope for what
my niece's husband calls Sky-entific matters. He has got a machine
for stopping the earth's motion. FATHER SICKY (not a nice name)
is spoken of here with much reference as the Great Astonisher, because
of his star-telling denouncements.
I think it is this latter gentleman who has the derangement of the
Roman Cullender, where there are Saints for every day in the year,
and every other one as well. The Cullender (there is a CARNAVAL
GÜLLEN, of Ireland, but I don't think he has anything to do with this),
in Rome is the same as ours in England, being divided into four
quarters, only that there is here another quarter, called the Jews'
Quarter, but that's in Rome I mean, not in the Cullender. The
Cullender, as one whole, is cleverly put together.
There are (this will infest many of your High Church friends) in
Rome, now, several English Clergymen of the Ulster-riddle party,
who have asked for a decision on the question of the rightfulidity (I
think that "s it) of their orders. I met one of them the other day
and had a long barjey with him on divers subjects, in which I had the
best of it; for I pointed out to him that if this was resided against him
and his party, he must leave the Protestant immunity and adopt the
Roman Candlestick Greed: "Which," I said depressively, "would
be, after all, only to escape Silly and fall into Cribbage." He seemed
much struck, and went away: I have not seen him airain. I showed
this worthy clergyman (from my notes on JULIA'S reading) what great
deferences there were between us and the Romans.
First.—I remonstrated to him that the Roman Candlesticks accept
many more books than we do as comical. To which he replied, "that
there_ was no cannon at all until after the respiration of three
sentries," which seemed to me to be evading the subject we were dis-
gusting, and so I told him. He couldn't answer me, when I asked him,
point Dank, how he could ever think of joining a Church which
accepted the two books of Molasses as comical? He was dumb-
foundled, and put his handkerchief to his face; poor fellow, he was
so afflicted, but I couldn't help following up my attack.
"What!" said I, from my hysterical notes on JULIA'S reading,
"MR. DOTTS, would you stupefy the acts of your four fathers P Those
noble Englishmen who, during the last General Consul held at Trent
in the Saveloy, preached the Glorious Defamation, and who with
MARTHA LUTHER (after whom the Luther Arcade in London, was
called), GALVIN (the discoverer of galvinism and other eccentricities;
we owe the eccentric telegraph to Aim), CRAMMER, Archbishop of
Canonbury, RIDLEMER and LATTERLY, and with other noble per-
formers were either developed in flames, or managed to extinguish
themselves nobly in the clause of truth P" He was quite overcome,

THE FLORID STYLE.
Is it vulgar to use the word "flowers" when you are speaking or
writing about them? Must they only be indicated, not actually men-
tioned, as was once the case with trousers P It would seem so, from a
correspondence which has been published on the subject of the money
to be spent this year on flowers in the Parks. There are only two
letters, and both together hardly make a dozen lines, yet in this little
space we find the gentleman who writes to MR. AYRTON turning the
phrases—"the sums annually devoted to floral purposes in Victoria
and Battersea Parks," and "the floral attractions of these popular
places of resort ;" and the gentleman who replies, by direction of MR.
AYRTON, using, what is perhaps a still more elegant expression, "the
floral arrangements in Battersea and Victoria Parks."
We cannot help regretting that the trees and shrubs could not have
been introduced into the correspondence, because of the fine opportunity
the writers would have had of speaking of "arboricultural purposes,
and " arboricultural attractions, and arboricultural arrangements."

pursuing JOHN BRIOHT'S 'bus and cab metaphor, said that he had a
great respect for "crawlers." "He had driven a ' crawler' himself
m his time." W. E. FORSTER driving a crawler! That must have
been when JOHN BRIGHT did not object to driving six 'busses abreast
at Temple, or any other, Bar!
IRBECONCILEABLE OPPOSITION.
THE consistency in antagonism of the low French Press to the
French Government is remarkable. The moment the latter ceased to
be personal, the former began.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
BRAVO, MONSIEUR HERVÍ! and abo bravo MESSIEURS M ANSELL! À
most plucky attempt to show London what an opéra bouffe is like with-
out SCHNEIDER and DUPDIS to sing and play, and M. JACQUES OÎÏEN-
BACH to compose the music. And, Gentlemen, take it on the whole, a
success, but an exceptional success, which is no precedent for the
future, mind you; for the introduction of Le Petit Faust, which is in
contemplation, we believe, will require great care and caution on the
part of the management. Much will be excused M. HERVÉ at present,
because the British Public (we knew a horrid, unpatriotic cynic who
chose to substitute и for i in the first syllable of " British " when talking
of these matters) doesn't as yet quite understand what it all means;
but if Chilpéric had been an English work, it wouldn't, with its present
libretto, with its absence of plot, and acted as it now is, have Stood a
week's chance with aforesaid plavgoinç British Public.
Chilpéric is admirably mounted, and is certainly the nearest approach
to the genuine opéra bouffe of Paris that we have yet seen done into
English. La Grande Duchesse, in English, at Covent Garden was a
mistake: it was Tom Thumb in Blunderbore's hall; bat Chilpéric at the
Lyceum is the right play in the right place. The mise-en-scene is ad-
mirable. The whole thing is brilliant throughout, as far as scenery and
costumes go; but the music—" /// musique atañí tout," as M. HERVÉ,
we are sure, would say—is not, to our thinking, up to that of L'Œil
Orné, which still remains, from a catchy-tuneful point (the essence of
this class of entertainment), the chief of M. HERVÉ s works.
Until you reach the grand tinale of the opera—that is, until you have
heard it almost up to the end—there is not one air which, on a first
hearing (" Then hear it twice," MESSRS. MANSELL will reply) makes
the public head wag, the hand beat time, and the foot irresistibly move
to the " go " of the music. This is reserved for the think, which is,
simply, a very effective waltz, and which, by the way, was some years
since arranged by MR. MUSGRAVE, and rendered more funnily and
effectively than in Chilpéric, as the finale to the burlesque of Paris at
the Strand.
Commend us to MONSIEUR MARIUS. Now, here is one of those
singing young gentlemen of whom we have not the like in England,
and wnose place in burlesque is invariably filled by some vivacious
actress. We haven't got a young man on the stage who can take either
M. HERVÉ'S place or that of M. MABIUS—that is, a fair tenor who is
also a comic actor—more of a "droll" than a comedian. The counter-
part of M. MARIOS is common in France and Italy: he has no exist-
ence here except disguised as the " The Great VANCE," or some other
distinguished "Champion Comic." We trust that, as MR. Ton
TAYLOR'S play of Axe and Crown at the Queen's may inaugurate the
Historical at the expense of the Hysterical Drama, so Chilpéric at the
Lyceum may incite some of our mute, inglorious Offenbachs and
Herves to come to the front, and that the example set in this new
venture of doing things well may be sufficiently successful, commer-
cially, to "encourage the performance " in the future.
One word as to the Orchestra. Capital: and conducted by MR.
MUSGRAVE, himself a composer of two successful English opérai bouffe»,
of no great pretension, it is true, but full of tune, musical fun, and the
true spirit of burlesque. The ballet is pretty and intelligent: they can
not only dance in tune, but sing well in tune. By "the ballet" we
specially mean King Chtlperic's Pages.
We subjoin, as is our wont, our own peculiar dramatic notice of " on
and off" the stage; and we could not help noticing that many a hint
came from amateurs and dilletanti, which M. HERVÉ might perhaps
have heard without pleasure, but on which he would, probably, have
acted after calm reflection. Wishing the enterprise all success, we take
our seat in the stalls.
IN THE THEATRE.
SCENE.—Entrance to Stallt; then the Stalls.
Officious Stall-keeper (hands programme, which Cheerful Gentleman,
who hat come in late, accepts). Take your coat, Sir F (Takes his coat,
Sir, and fives Aim numbered ticket. Sir)—and hat, Sir P
Cheerful Qentleman (a» if he 'd rather part with his life than this,
answers farcely). No.
[It about to enter Stalls, under the impression that he can walk at
once to his. Suddenly fads himself between the Opéra bouffe in
full sing, which has just commenced, and crowded Stalls, all in-
tent on the performance—Foresees a difficult]/.
Officious Boxkeeper (pointing out the Stall, middle of middle row, which
Cheerful Gentleman has selected a week ago as the best place in the house.)
There it is, Sir. Take for the programme, Sir P
Cheerful Gentleman (with unobtrusive humour, as the question is put to
him in this form) No, thank yon.
[Stall-keeper nonplussed, offers book of the piece, which is politely
refused. Cheerful man begins to fly from Stall-keeper over toes,
and amid the somethings, not loud but deep, to his Stall in the
middle. As he goes along sideways, like a crab, he mutters to gen-
tlemen and ladies—Бее pardon— (toes)—beg pardon—(kicks a
hat. This is an awful outrage, and leaves its owner, looking after
the destroyer of his nap, scowling and caressing the hat with his
elbow, and growling out something about "He wishes people would,
<$•<;., gre.")—pardon—(catches in lady's dress)—a thousand par-
dons—(to a lady's cloak which, being caught in the buttons of
his tails by its fringe, he has dragged along with Aim—owner,
an elderly lady, four stalls off, is under the impression it 's a new
dodge of the Swell Mob.) At last he arrives, and sits down with
a satisfad air, as much as to say, "Nou> then, we 'II see what 's
going on," which he can't, because he suddenly discovers that
he 's dropped his bill. Says "aether!" to himself, and tries to
look over his neighbour's programme. Neighbour surly. Cheerful
man recognises friends and nods, as if assuring them of his own
safety, and of the gratification that they must feel on having
been seen by him.
Lounger (to a Friend, after hearing M. Mariusfor some time). What 's
he say г
Cynical Friend. Don't know.
Lounger (after hearing M. Hervé in the Second Act). What 's he say?
Cynical Friend. Don't know. But judging from what we have heard
of the libretto, one doesn't lose anything.
Lounger (smiles with a vague feeling that something deep is meant).
Ab! What 's it all about P (He asks this in the First Scene of Act III.)
Cynical Friend (referring to Programme). Chilpéric,}. believe.
Lounger (under the impression he is being chaffed). Thank you.
Judicious Person (behind Cheerful one). HERVÉ 's like what FECHTER
must have been in his first stage of English, eh P
Cheerful Friend. Yes. FECHTER thinned, and set to music.
Judicious Person. If HERVÉ and MARIUS would only speak slower,
one could understand them.
Amateur (to Critic). They manage their voices well, don't they P
Oritie (sarcastically). Their what? (Amateur is abashed. Critic
dogmatises graciously.) Miss MUIR is a very good contralto for this
theatre. The little lady from the Conservatoire sings тегу nicely, and
so does the Druidess.
Irish Lady (to two of her party). Be my faith now, I think it de-
loightful. (Applauds vehemently with her fan.) I could see it every
night in the week, and oftcner. What do you think, SIR THOMAS P
Sir Thomas. Well—yes—I—the ballet 's good. (The Cancan is now
going on end of Act II., in which all join.)
Irish Lady. Good!!! (Pauses for words to express the admiration of
the Cancan, and ft/i<h them.) Sure I think it classic and volupshus.
(Settles SIR THOMAS.)
End of Act II. Vociferous applause for the dance. [N.B. Cancan spirit-
edly danced; no vulgarity. M. HERVÉ is a wonderful man, author,
composer, actor, singer, dancer.'] Calls for "HARVEY, HERVY,
MARRY'DS," arc. Enter before the Curtain all the principal Cha-
racters. Calis continued. Enter before the curtain THE ENTIRE
BALLET. Calls continued. Enter all the "EXTRA LADIES" appa-
rently. Roars of laughter. Calls discontinued. {Fact.)
Lounger (who has been an habitue of the Theatres for years). Well, I
never saw that before in any theatre. If they'd gone on calling, I
suppose we 'd have had out the " supers" next, and then the car-
penters, and then the stage-door keeper. What a pity they forgot the
Chorus.
Inane Person (coming out of his Stall), Charming! isn't it P So
Parisian!
Lounger. H'm! Have you seen this in Paris, eh P
Inane Person. In Paris P No—at least—that is—(makes up his mind
to tell the truth and escape.) No. (Escapes.)
Country Visitor (in Pit). So that's MARIUS, is it P Well, I 've often
heard talk of him singing at Covent Garden, and I 'm glad I 've seen
him, though he don't look his age. I s'pose that 's Italian he 's talking.
(Lives for the rest of his life under the ira conviction that he has heard
the great MARIO in " Chilperie.")
Last Act. Charming Final«.
Lounger (to Friend in Lobby). Yes: something novel about it.
Cheerful Friend. There are no tunes that one can take away, except
the last. [Begins humming tt.
Cynical Person (stopping him). And for goodness' sake don't rob
them of that.
Oritie. I 've got a notion for s serious opera. I 'd cast it with
FECHTER, BANKMANN, HERR FORMES, MARIUS, HERVÉ, MADAME
CELESTE, and STELLA COLAS, and if I could only get SCHNEIDER to
go in for a course of English before breakfast, wouldn't it draw P
Allons to PADDY'S and high art. [Exeunt omnes.
A Stronger Way of Putting It.
WRITING from Rome, a Correspondent states that—
"The principle of the POPE'S temporal power is to be asserted by a oanon."
This may be very well, but it strikes us that the principle of any
temporal power might be far more forcibly asserted by a cannon.

THE WORST OP DRUNKENNESS.
"DRUNKENNESS is bad enough in a man, but in a woman"—
noralists who have got thus far generally want words to say what it
i and complete their sentence. They mean to say that female drun-
lenness is тегу much worse than male. That being granted, good
«opio, please consider the subjoined extract from a report of the talk
tiered at the Mechanics' Institute, Halifax, the other day, where a
eputation from the Halifax Licensed Victuallers' League, or rather,
pparently, Anti-Licensed Victuallers' League, waited on MB. STANS-
ELD, M.P.. to urge the imposition of new restrictions upon the
Trade. MB. STANSFELD having expressed the incontrovertible
.
pinion that it was better for the working-man to drink his own wine
nd beer at home than go to the public-house for it :—
"MB. EDMONSON remarked that, coincident with the introduction of MR.
Г.А i wTONh'H Act, the drunkenness of women had gone on increasing. In
.ilifax that was lamentably the саве.
"ÜB. STANSFIÎI.II thought the question was an important one for conside-
itiun , if the stutiKl ii:a were reliable. But statistics were very apt to deceive.
'e should Шее to know if the peculiar drunkenness described had arisen from
Ш consumption of light wines.
"Mu. EDMONSON said he was enabled to state from experience that many
omen now obtained drink at grocers' shops who never drank before, and who
ou Id not be seen in a public-house."
The exalted opinion which every right-minded man entertains of the
ore delicate sex renders it difficult to believe that women as well as
en are apt to be induced to get drunk by facilities for drunkenness.
ne would like to know whether Mu. EDMONSON is prepared to sub-
an tiate his statement to that effect by affidavit, and abo if the Mowing
Duld be adhered to under the same obligation :—
"Л WORK ixii-SI AN remarked that one part of the evil was this :— the
imán who necessarily had charge of the ordinary duties of an establishment
ught drink under a fictitious name, and was aseisted in the operation by the
lililíes which MB. GLADSTONES Act afforded. The result was that the
wives of working-men were more drunkenly inclined than they used to be,
and the industrious artisan had to bear all the expense."
Admit for the sake of argument—with a shudder, of course, at the
mere imagination of the possibility that any but a very few exceptional
women in the lowest station in life are ever in the least degree the
worse for liquor—that "women who never drank before," as MB, ED-
MONSON unreservedly said, now obtain "drink" at grocers' shops,
insomuch that the "drunkenness" of women has "gone on increas-
ing:," and, as the WoKKiNQ-MxN who followed him declared, in terms
of equal coarseness, peculiarly and painfully idiomatic, that the wives
of working-men are now "more drunkenly inclined than they used to
be." What would follow F That if the agitators for the closure of
public-houses could effect their purpose, they would necessarily occasion
an increase of intemperance—too gross a word even that to use, though
merely in hypothetical relation to angelic beings—among women!
As it was forcibly and familiarly, bnt with shocking vulgarity, once
put by an outspoken Man of the People, "the Missus would take to
sucking at the gin-bottle in the cupboard."
"True," the United Kingdom Alliance might answer. "Then abolish
the Liquor Trade altogether. No more Château Margaux! No more
Chambertin, Beaune, Fownard. Château d'Yquem! No more Hock or
Champagne of any description! Cakes if you like, but no more Ale!"
friends, how many of you are prepared to affirm all these negations
with "Hooray !" P Don't you think the best Liquor Law would be
one like the hydrostatic law by which liquors, left to themselves, find
their own level!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
First Visit to the Baths,—I choose the nearest bathe, not the
Kaiserbad, which is the largest and grandest, and where the baths form
part of the hotel.
Am received by a courteous elderly lady and her daughter, who look
as if I was the lust person they had expected to see.
Happy Thought— Say what I'те come for. A few baths. Will I
take them all at once, which is cheaper, or not? I don't quite under-
stand: possibly because 1 am talking French (in English), and they are
speaking the same language (in German). Becoming intelligible to one
another, I ascertain that their question is one of tickets. I take a lot,
recklessly, paying I don't know quite how much, in thalers. Elderly
lady smiles encouragingly on me, and asks me if I will descend the
steps P If they lead to the baths, yes. They do. Elderly lady sounds
a bell. I descend, and pass through the glass folding-doors into a
passage with whitewashed walls and ceiling, and a row of small doors
on either side.
First Impression.—Prison on the Silent System.
À small, fresh-faced man, in a chronic state of mild perspiration,
looking, in his white jacket and apron, something like a superior
French cook without a cap, appears before me, and says—
"Good morning, sare."
Happy Thought. — Bath-man speaks English: in case the bath
shouldn't agree with me, useful. Which bard F " he asks, laconically,
and allows me to look in at the doors of several cells. No prisoners in
just now. Attendant shakes his head. "Late for bard (bath)," he
says. "Twenty, dirty, men season." From which I readily gather, that
in the season, which is now almost past (there are three days more of
it) the baths are full.
Finding that I don't make up my mind on the subject, he settles it
for me peremptorily, and showing me into acell, observes, Nice bard,"
and shakes his head solemnly, as much as to say, '' You couldn't get a
better than this, if you tried ever so much." The compartment I am in,
is a small undressing-room of the very plainest description: either a
cell, as struck me at first, in a prison, or in the monastery of a very
ascetic order.
Happy Thought.—The Bathing Monks. Never were any, I fancy.
Good idea. Might suggest it to ecclesiastical authorities.
The bath is where the sitting-room would be if these were lodgings
with apartments en suite.
At first eight there appears to be a sort of scum on the water, which
suggests my remark to the attendant. "Dirty!"
lie smiles. "Goot," he replies. "Dirty; goot," and dips a large
thermometer into the bath.
This doesn't satisfy me as to its cleanliness. On the wall is a notice,
informing the visitor that he baa a right to insist upon seeing the bath
prepared in his presence, by order of the Committee.
1 draw the attendant's attention to this, and then pointing to the
bath, I shake my head, and say emphatically, and with an air of disgust,
"Dirty!"
Happy Thought.—Wish ME. PATTNE, the pantomimist, were here.
Wonder how he 'd explain my meaning to the attendant.
The man noda in reply, "Yah so: dirty; hot," which is not a cheer-
ing view. I 've seen Third Class written up over the doors of Baths
and Wash-houses in London. It strikes me that mine will be something
of this sort unless I can explain that I do insist upon its being prepared
in my presence.
Happy Thought.—My Conversation-Book is in my pocket. Difficult
to find the correct place at once, so as to exactly suit the occasion.
Open quickly, and come upon
The Chandler Der lÀchtzieher.
The Chimney Sweeper . . Der Kaminfeger.
No: that won't do. Still it will be useful to know where to find the
Chandler and Chimney-Sweeper when I ¿to want them another time.
Happy Thought.—ULtii the place. Look at Index for "Bath,"
"Dirty," and "Clean."
Is the Index at the end or beginning P
Look at the end. No. Only "Models for Notes." "Note on not
finding a person at home." "Note of invitation." "Note of apology."
Happy Thought.—Mark these. Useful another time. Index in
beginning. Under what heading? Don't know. Begin at the
beginning. Bother: it '» not alphabetical, and it occupies four pages
of small print.
The attendant is busy preparing my bath.
I run my eye and finger quickly down the first page of "Contents."
Happy Thought.—-It ought to be dis-contents. (N.B. Work this up;
do for something of SHERIDAN'S or SIDNEY SMITH'S : more like SMITH.)
"Fraction», Army, Ammunition." Hang ammunition !" Time,
Man." I pause here. Man.
Happy nought.—Look out Man. Perhaps find "Bath-man" under
that heading. No; on reflection, it'я "dirty" and " clean" that I
want. Go on again with Index: "Reptiles, Insects. Maladies, Kitchen,
Cellar, Servants, Mountains, Rivers, Agricultural Implements." Hang
these things! Where are Adjectives, good strong Adjectives P
"Affirmative Phrases, Negative Phrases." This is nearer, warm, as
children say in hide-and-seek. "Erclesiastical Dignities." Cold again.
"Music." Absolutely chilly. "Field Sports." Oh, bother! Ha!
"Imperative Phrases." Warmer. "With\a Woollen Draper." Lost it
once more. "A Lady at her Toilet." Toilet may be of some use to me
now. "The Master before getting up."
Happy Thought.—Look out Imperative Phrases. Laay at Toilet, and
Before getting up. Combine some words for present use.
The attendant has finished. The bath is steaming. "Nice bard," he
says. "Nice ; hot; dirty." Here he points to 30° Reaumur on the
thermometer.
Happy Thought.—I understand him at last. He thought I wanted
the bath at thirty, what he calls dirty.
No: Da. CASPAR particularly said 27°.
Happy Thought.—Point to that number on Thermometer. Hit myself
on the chest, frown, say "No no, Nein Nein, Ich wünsch (l mean I
want) twenty-seven. Doctor order."
"Not dirty?" he asks, in astonishment.
"Nein, Nein" I reply, we are beginning to understand one another
beautifully. "I said rfirty, not TAirty "—pause to let him digest this.
He is intelligent. He smiles. "An!" he says, and pulls a huge
wooden plug out of the bath, I suppose to alter the temperature.
Happy Thought.—While he is busy look out The Master before
getting up. Here it is—" PETBR what o'clock is it?" "Will you
shave P" No. Ah, here, "You must give me my cotton stockings with
my boots and my kerseymere trousers "—pretty dress !" Give me
my boots, as the streets must be dirty." Dirty—here we are. [N.B.
German manners and customs deduced from Conversation-Book;
ex. gr. if the weather hadn't been dirty, he 'd have gone out without his
boots.] "Dirty" is Schmuziff,
Happy Thptight.—" Dot Wasser in dem Bad ist Schmveig."
He is indignant. To prove his assertion of its cleanliness he takes a
handful and drinks it. Solvitur bibendo. I am satisfied.
The bath is ready—and so am I. A voice, resounding beneath the
small dome, whence daylight comes in, calls out something.
"Kommen," replies the attendant, and leaves me to my bath. I am
to stop in half ми hour, and forty minutes if I can do so. Now to
commence.
THE MUSIC OF THE FUTURE.
"It is proposed to give all Hailway Whiitles a musical pitch."
Tnis is, or rather will be, a good hearing for excruciated travellers,
tortured householders fcrced to live near stations, and terrified cattle
pasturing in fields adjoining lines of railway, and we record the
announcement with a note of satisfaction. The various Companies will,
we are sure, act in concert, as is their usual practice, and adopt a uni-
form pitch for all the whistles in the Kingdom; holding for this
purpose a Harmonic Meeting, at which the question will be settled
without the interruption of a single discordant voice. One thing the
Directors must not do —whatever expense may be incurred in giving
the Engines, their Drivers, and Firemen a musical education, it must
not be made a pretext for raising the fares; that would be paying too
dear for our whistle.
If the Costermongers, the Dustmen, and the vendors of various
indispensable commodities in our cheerful and exquisitely clean streets
and thoroughfares, could be taught to use their voices m a melodious
manner, everybody's comfort and tranquillity would be greatly in-
creased in this happy Metropolis.
A MUCH NEEDED LESSON.
"CHIEF-JUSTICE COCXBDBN, in ordering the rule to be made absolute for
a mandamus to the Election Commissioners at Bridgewater to grant MR.
LOVIBOND his certificate of indemnity, paeeed a bitter censure on the Commis-
sioners — clearly singling out MB. CHESHOLM ANSTHY — for their brow-
beating of the witness. MB. ANBTEY had accused MR. LOVIBOND of giving

NEW CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE.
AS SHAKSPEARE vaccinatpd' Tills im-
portant question which has hitherto
been a matter of considerable doubt,
and the origin of a good deal of
virulent controversy amongst anti-
quaries, is at last satisfactorily
answered by a letter which has been
recently discovered in a very unlikely
spot—in Spain—amongst the Siman-
cas MSS. It was written by DA.
К л i >c u IT к, the physician who taught
QUEEN ANKE how to eat asparagus,
and addressed to LADT MARY
WORTLEY MONTAGU, the bel esprit
•who introduced the artichoke into
this country from Jerusalem, and
inoculated the leaders of fashion with
a taste for that esculent; and in it
the Doctor states that his grandfather, who was an eminent paper-
hanger at Stratford-upon-Avon. remembered being told by his old
nurse that her first husband's great aunt distinctly recollected
stroking, when a girl, the cow—dan, with a white face—to which
"the Swan of Avon" was indebted for his preservation from the
dangerous and disfiguring malady then so rife in England. This old
lady, the great aunt of the first husband of the nurse of the grandfather
of DR. RADCLIPFE, who lived to be ninety-five, averred that the cow
she remembered fondling was always called "Shakspeare's Cow," and
was treated with the greatest respect and the choicestjodder; and that
at the Stratford " Jubilee " a tuft of hair from its tail was formed into a
bracelet, and presented, with a complimentary address on vellum, by
the Mayor and Corporation to MBS. GARRICK, who by will bequeathed
it to the Beef-Steak Club, enclosed in a box made out of a piece of the
mahogany tree, under ¡which SHAKSPEAB.E used to sit and smoke and
drink mulled Canary with BEN JONSON and SIR THOMAS Lucy, before
the battle of La Hogue.
This interesting letter will shortly be published (it is in cipher, but
fortunately the key is in the possession of the Ironmongers' Company)
with a preface, prolegomena, introduction, copious variorum notes,
including some ingenious but entirely conjectural emendations, appen-
dixes, and indexes, and with illustrations and fac-similes produced by
the new ehromophotolithotintotypoxylographio process. À few copies
willbe struck off on large paper and appropriately bound in calf, for
presentation to various learned and scientific bodies at home and
abroad.
In that delightful book for a drizzling day, the Diversions of Parley—
the only book, JOHNSON said that ever led him to neglect his mother-
in-law, and in which, by the way. the earliest mention of croquet
occurs—HOHNE TOOKE first broiiplioil the startling theory that the tap-
root of the Anglo-Saxon tongue is not to be found in the great Aryan
family of languages, as HELIOGABALUS and the learned JUAN FER-
NANDEZ maintained, but in the Syro-Phccnician group, discovered by
COLUMBUS in one of the Pacific oceans, immediately upon the revival
of learning in the mountain fastnesses of the Zollverein.
The aboriginal tin-plate workers introduced this language into Corn-
wall towards the close of a fine afternoon in the dark ages, and from
thence it spread rapidly over the entire island, until it reached the ears
of the Romans who in their coracles, under the command of CINCIN-
NATUS—his descendants subsequently emigrated to the ;New World
and .there founded Cincinnati—had then recently discovered Bristol
and the Severn salmon, but a few miles from the spot where the
missing books of lav Y were lost in a gale oil' the Land's End.
There is no doubt that SHENSTONE knew who the author of Junius
was, and that if he had lived a few years longer he would 'not have
destroyed the repository of the secret—the little shagreen casket which,
to the great chagrin of all interested in this the unsolved problem of
our Literature, the author of The Schoolmistress committed to the
flames, while sitting in the dining-parlour of the Leaaowes with WILKES
and LORD LTTTELTON over their walnuts and wine, the night WARREN
HASTINGS came home from India, with portmanteaus of rupees, and met
SIR Pu iLir FRANCIS in a pouring rain under Temple Bar, returning
from a dinner-party at LORD GEOHGE SACKVILLE'S, in Grafton Street.
SHBNSTONK always slept with the little casket under his pillow, a
loaded blunderbuss and a watchman's rattle on the coverlet, and a
night-light burning on the mantel-piece. A bloodhound lay crouching
on a cocoa-nut mat outside the chamber-door, and two military pen-
sioners from the nearest market-town patrolled the shrubberies and
tried the doors of the house every hour during the night.
MORNING ENVÏLOPES.—Dressing Gowns.
GOOD NEWS FOR BAD TRAVELLERS.
Mr DEAR SMITH,
HAS your wife seen this ?—
"FROFFSSOR TYNDALL assorte that, by means of cotton wool, air as pure
as that of the Alpi, may be brought into the chamber of the invalid."
Men like you and me, who hate the bore of travelling, may surely
feel rejoiced at this comforting intelligence. No more need in future
to take our wives to Switzerland when their health requires recruiting.
A bit of cotton wool will answer all the purpose of a journey to
Chamounix. Although throughout the season she appears robust and
vigorous, it is usual for my [wife to become an invalid about the
first of August, and to discover that pure Alpine air is absolutely
needful to save her from complete and permanent prostration. Now,
thanks to dear friend TINDALL, instead of taking tickets for Lucerne
or Geneva, I shall merely get a respirator made of cotton wool, and
thus enable my poor invalid to breathe as.much pure air as 'she con-
siders to be needful. If she requires some mounting exercise as well
as mountain air, she can exert herself by making the ascent of Prim-
rose Hill, or mounting to the summit of St. Paul's when she thinks
proper. If we cotton to the plan of using cotton wool to breathe
through, we may dine cosily at home throughout the month of August,
instead of being plagued by noisy foreign tables d'hâte; and although
we miss the sight of some pleasant mountain scenes, we shall also miss
the sight of the unpleasant bills incurred for the privilege of seeing
them.
With a hope that MRS. SHITE may thank'me for the hint, I remain
hers, most devotedly, JERBMIAH HUNKS.
POUNDERS STERLING.
IF it were really a truth that the "sperrits" ever do, under condi-
tions, rap out answers to questions propounded to them by people
in the flesh, we should like to ask one of mem, renowned in its earthly
day, what it thinks of the statement which follows, extracted from a
letter written by MAJOR PALLISER to the Times on the rivalry between
pointed chilled shot and shot of flat-headed steel :—
"The late controversy cost the country £30,000, 'although it was confined
to 12-pounder8 and 70-pounden. I would aek, what will be the coet when
600-pounders are at stake? Erery round fired from the 70-pounder co«t about
17«.; every round shot fired from the 600-pounder would cost £8 or £9."
There once existed, "in the form," as Yankee Mediums say, a certain
Spirit that might have been called the Spirit of Public Economy. Is
that Spirit present—the Spirit of JOSEPH HUME F If so, will that dear
spirit Ъе so obliging as to rap the table and say what it thinks of
blazing away sums of from seventeen'shillings to nine'pounds in artillery
experiments at one bang, and not a single enemy killed, or a farthing's
worth of enemy's property destroyed to show for it P
No answer—of course not. It needs no ghost from the grave 'to tell
us what fools we should be to allow our money to be fired away at that
rate in unnecessary experiments, yet what still greater fools to shirk
trying any such experiments, if necessary. The known ability to sink
an enemy's fleet may save us the expense of having to do so at nine
pounds a shot.
But where will the increasing cost of projectiles stop? By-and-by,
perhaps, we'shall talk of six hundred-pounders meaning guns costing
£600 every discharge. Every gun will fire away a little fortune at a
time, enough to make a wife and several children happy. But then
what nation will be able to afford war?
CABBY THE CORSAIR.
THUS spoke the Cabman, a frantic halloo,
"Up with the false flag, and down with the true;
Sixpence a mile only stands for my doo,"
"Driver, how much P" "Sir, I '11 leave it to you."

knows that Chinamen wear tails, and attach a high
value to them. But few may be aware that these caudal appendages
are actually the measure of value in the Flowery Land. In the Chinese
Revenue Accounts just published, the value of duties on imports is put
down at 3,157,445 taels. that on exports at 4,879,0-15 taels, and lhat

MINISTRIES AND MOBS.
Dois the French Government deserve to be called Liberal P That depends upon
what you mean by the term. Says the Pott, very truly :—
"If it in understood to mean permission to mobs to have their own way, to contemn the
established authority, and to dictate to the more respectable portion of the community,
then the present ¿¿ministration of France is not deserving or being called Liberal, and
the Premier is, of all others, the least inclined to claim for it that title."
What then shall we say of a Government which did let mobs have their own
way, hold seditious meetings, push down park rails, march in menacing proces-
sions through the streets, and dictate to the more respectable portion of the com-
munity in so far as they could f Shall we call it a Liberal Government F With
a qualification. Let us say Liberal Conservative. Such a Government, in existence
three years ago, preceded that which is now promoting the happiness and pro-
sperity of the United Kingdom. Of the sort of Government .which M. OLLFVIBB'S
is not, and the late DEBBY Administration was, the Post goes on to observe :—
"But in truth no such Government is to be found in the world."
Let us hope so. MB. GLADSTONE rules in Downing Street—ME. WALPOLB
weeps there no more. The present Home Secretary does not, perhips, cry when
he should act; but if MB. BBUCE differed from his penultimate predecessor more
decidedly than in not crying at such times, we should be the better able to trust
that in troth the world contains no such Government as one by which mobs are,
or would be on occasion, allowed to have their own way, and riot and create terror

A MOVEMENT is said to be going on in Saltaire with the view of raising a testi-

to a Baronetcy. In conferring distinction on a meritorious gentleman the Govern-
ment, while they were about it. might have made it a Peerage. SIR TITUS SALT,

THE MISSION OF THE MAYORS.

OP MERC i к к and the'Mayors
Sing the glorious day's renown,
Interviewing, at low fares,
Him that wears the Belgian crown;
While "the Casket" in the front proudly shone!
Many Mayors, each wife in hand.
Braving nausea, left the land;
And GODRLEY, brave and bland,
Led them on!
Mayors are but men, afloat.
O'er the bulwarks in the brine
Many were the accounts cast up
Ere they reached the Calais line;
]t was twelve of Tuesday morn by the chime.! ]
As they steamed upon their path,
Many a Mayor looked pale as death,
And e'en GCUBLEY held his breath—
For a time!
BRITANNIA might have blush'd
O'er her Mayors so grim and green,
While the steward fleetly rushed
On his ministry unclean.
Once a joke gallant GOURLEI had begun—'
But he scarce had oped his lips
When the steamer's rolls and dips
Cast inelegant eclipse
O'er his fun!
Again! Again! Again 1
And the heaving did not slack,
Though his feeble joke, in vain,
Here and there a Mayor would crack—
MEBCŒB'S mirth along the deck slowly booms;
But what joking can avail
'Gainst sick Mayoresses' wail,
Or of prostrate Mayors and pale
Light the gloom F
Out-spoke bold GOURLEY then:
"Is Ч thus Britons should behave F
If you're Mayors, be also men!
With Mounseer your credit save!
Lo, at Calais, in smooth water, now we swing!"
Straight each Mayor was on his feet,
And each Mayoress—scarce so neat,
As when starting en visite
To a King!
Calais buffet brought relief,
Terra-firma brought repose,
And with GOURLEY, Mayor-in-chief,
Off the Mayors' mail-train goes.
And Brussels safely wins, at close of clay.
Where when Mayor and May'ress 'light,
Thanks to ANSPACH the polite.
They, in gratis flies stowed tight,
Drive away
Now joy. old England, raise,
That the glory of thy Mayors
From Hôtel de Ville ablaze
To Laëken's Palace flares—
The Casket has been giv'n, address read o'er 1
At the King they 'ye had a peep,
Done the Belgian lions cheap,
Been ball'd and op'ra'd deep,
Fed galore!
Brave Mayors,—your country's pride,
Who at MERCLER'S summons flew,
And the Channel waves defied,
Belgium's King to "interview,"
May BRITANNIA, on your way home, rule the wave;
Or, if the steamer rolls,
You 've the glory that consoles
The stomachs and the souls
Of the brave!

THERE 1 You CAN trow SEE HOW
NEW CAB REGULATIONS.
FURTHER improvements in our Street Cabs are understood to be
contemplated at Scotland Yard, and the Home Office. The following
are a few of them :—
1. The Tickets to be printed on toned paper, and scented like play-
bills. When presenting them to ladies, Cabmen always to wear gloves
—white Berlin in Summer, buff dogskin in Winter.
2. Foot-warmers to be provided in cold weather. Sunblinds to be
affixed to the windows. The floor to be covered with a handsome
carpet.
3. Cabmen to supply themselves with the daily papers and weekly
comic periodicals for the accommodation of passengers; but not to
demand more than the stated prices.
•1. At the annual inspection, Cabmen to appear in their best clothes,
with boots nicely blacked, and a flower in the button-hole.
5. Cabmen to be encouraged to mount flags of elegant shape and
Xithetic design, and to wear ornamental badges on their persons.
Decorative patterns to be prepared by the Students at South Ken-
sington.
6. When Children are carried, Cabmen always to assist them to
alight, and to be very particular with the baby.
7. Every Cabman to be provided with a Map of London and
MURRAY'S Handbook for the information of foreigners, and each Stand
to have at least one Cab with a driver familiar with the French Language.
8. In case of a dispute as to the legal fare, the Cabman not to be
allowed to remain out in the cold, but to be asked into the Hall, and
offered a seat. One of the boys always loitering about in the streets,
to be employed to stand at ,the horse's head while the driver is in-
doors. Boys engaged in this service will be required to wear a badge
or plate in their caps, on which a reasonable charge .is to be legibly
inscribed, either in black letters, on a white ground, or in white letters
on a black ground. .
9. MR. BRUCE, COLONEL HENDERSON, and Mr. Punch always to
ride free.
INSTANCES OF WRETCHED LEGISLATION.—Our P-;; Laws.
THIS IS TO GIVE NOTICE.
IN "Evenings from Home" last week, in the course of an account
of CAilpéric at the Lyceum, the name of the popular French dance
fa/mot v,as spelt runyaii ; that is, mth the cedilla, instead of without it.
This was no clerical error, but was intended to convey a profundity of
humour which only one enlightened person discovered (and he proudly
wrote to say so)—that the cancan is so much softened down at the
Lyceum as to merit the order of the Cedilla. In fact it is a drawing-
room Cancan (we hope it is drawing without the room, at SHERIDAN
MM?—ahem !), and it would be well if, henceforth, without further ex-
planation, theatrical advertisements, or notices, should adopt the two
words cancan and cancan, as respectively expressing the impropriety or
the propriety of the celebrated French dance.
ALL WELL EMPLOYED.
MR, GLADSTONE, we are told, has been felling timber in the recess.
His colleagues, it is understood, have been similarly occupied.
MR. LUWE has been cutting down the Estimates.
LORD CLARENDON has been lopping off excrescences in the Foreign
Department.
MR. GUILDERS has been hewing away at the Staff of the Dock-
yards.
The LORD CHANCELLOR has been busy amongst the branches of his
profession.
MR. CARDWELL has been retrenching.
MR. AYRTON has been using the prnning-knife; and the whole of
the Ministers, Mr. Punch hopes, have been busy rooting up abuses.
One Good Tura Deserves Another.
JAKJSS CLIFFORD, a clever ex-artilleryman, has been sentenced to
two years' imprisonment for an offence well known to the Criminal
Ccurts in old days, but new in our own, "sweating " sovereigns. He
might plead "reciprocity." Don't the sovereigns sweat us?

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
WHAT can you do in a bath? How slowly the time goes! Forty
minutes in 26" Reaumur. You can't read with comfort. You can't
talk, unless to yourself, which is, I believe, the sure forerunner of
madness. If you have some one in the next bath, you can talk to
him, if you're acquainted; but even then your conversation is heard
by everybody else. No, it 's the sulphur silent system and water.
But one can't positively lose forty minâtes of the day. What can one
do in a bath P
Happy Thought— Think.
This reminds me of the celebrated Parrot. Besides you can think
just as well out of the bath; better. Might learn German in my bath.
Might, and also mightn't.
The Bath is a good place for "wondering." You can wonder what
good it will do you? Wonder what 's the matter with you? Wonaer
who's in the next bath? Wonder what the time is? Wonder, и
you had a fit,'whether you 'd be able to seize the bell in time? Wonder
if it isn't all humbug? Wonder if it is? Wonder if the Bath-man
Hew at you with a knife and attacked you, what chance you 'd have?
Wonder if you might sleep in the bath? Wonder what possible
pleasure the Romans found in always bathing? &c., &c., &c.
The Bath-man suddenly looks in. "Time," he says, as if I were
going in for another round at a prize-fight. 1 look at my watch: no,
I don't think so. "Nein." I add, with courage, "Fünf Minuten mair,"
I mean five minutes more: mair being, of course, Scotch.
He understands me. I am sure there is nothing like dashing boldly
into a language.
The gentleman either in the bath next me, or a few doors off, doesn't
find any difficulty in amusing himself in the bath. I never heard snch
a row as he makes. He sings snatches of songs, chiefly Operatic, and
never correct, in a stentorian voice. Wish I could silence him. I now
have something to do in my bath; to silence this dreadful noise.
The question- is, hasn't a man a right to do what he likes in his own
bath P Yes. If / may think, he may sing; but, on the other hand
[[ always like to put the othtr side of the question fairly to myself: by
the way, I generally see the other side better than my own] he may not
sing to the obvious prevention of my thinking. My thinking doesn't
interfere with anybody; his singing does. Stop, though ; if /interfere
noWj the result of my thinking is evidently that I do interfere with his
singing. This assumes quite a casuistical appearance. He is beginning
an air from Norma that I know.by heart. When I say singing, I mean
roaring. He gets to the seventh bar, and then pauses, evidently in
doubt.
Happy Thought.—To finish it for him.
I do so, with diffidence, and not so loudly аз he has been giving it.
Pause. This will evidently lead to a struggle, unless he has caved in
at the first shot from my battery—I 'should say, bath-ery. I am
allowed to think in peace for about a minute. Then he breaks out
again. I believe he has been collecting a répertoire during the silence.
"Void If sabre, le sabre, le sabre!" &c. He gets into difficulties at
the high part—about the fourteenth bar, I should say.
Happy Thought.—His weakness is my opportunity. I come in at the
finish, whistling this time. Without waiting, he begins, "Ah, que
j'aime les Militaires!"
Happy '[¡¡ought.—Pu/.zle him. Sing the quick movement in На^-мо
in Algeria, slightly adapted by myself, on the spur of the moment, to
the occasion.
He now sings Largo at factotum hoarsely, but not merrily; for I
detect a certain ferocity in his voice. I must be careful; because, if
he is a Prussian officer, he will call me out when he meets me outside.
Happy Thought.—Сал say what the Clown does when he 's caught
by a shopkeeper, " Please, Sir, twasn't me."
Bath-man appears with towels.
"Fünf Minuten", says he. I should say rather say it was; twenty-
live minutes, more likely. "Towel: nice varm," he continues, and
having dried me carefully in one, he wraps me in another, and leaves
me.
Classic dress this. Think of SOCRATES. The Singing Man has
holloaed for the bath-attendant, and is evidently preparing to leave.
Ilappy Thought.—Ring for Bath-man, and (after consulting Conver-
sation-Book and combining my question) ask him who the singing bather
is. Can't find "singing" in Conversation-Book. I find "a song:"
i.e., ein Lied. Der Herr is "the gentleman."
Happy thought.—Recollect having seca in pkybüls the part of So-
and-So, Mr. Blank (wilA a song), .that's the idea. The Bath-man
enters. "You ring?"
"Yah. Wer ist der Herr mit ein Lied?"
Triumph! only I wish he wouldn't answer me in German. How-
ever, I make out that he doesn't know. He merely speaks of him as
"Der andere Mann ; " that is, with a concession to my language, "the
other man." There are two men, then, in the bath; one is myself,
and the other is Der andere Mann.
Fifth Bath Day.—Der andere Mann is in the bath every day. I hear
him. I never see him. He comes in either just before me, or just after
me, and leaves in the same relative proportion of time.
Happy TAouffht.—The Bathing Box and Cox. Similar in situation,
except that we never meet anywhere. I discover that this is one con-
sequence of the Season being terminated. Der andere Mann and myself
are the only two remaining to bathe in the New Baths. Other bathers
go to the Kaiserbad, or to other springs; for there are sulphur springs
everywhere in, out of, and round and about Ais.
Sunday.—Visit the Cathedral in the morning. It is crammed full,
as, by the way, are all the Churches, apparently at any hour, in Aachen.
I am here struck by a most
Tremendous Happv Thought.—k new idea for POPOOOD AND GROOLLY.
It is a Theory of Origination. It comes to me all at once. It will
astonish COLENSO, upset DESCASTES, scatter Darwinian theories, and
perhaps create an entire revolution in philosophy and science.
Happy Г/40к/7«.—Perhaps become a Heresiweh. New sect: Happy
makers, not Ггее-Thinkers. Be condemned by the POPE, be collated
(or something, whatever it is) by the AKCHBISHOP OP CANTERBURY,
denounced Ъу the Chief Imaum, held up to execration by Da. ABLER
and the principal Rabbis, pronounced contumacious by the Alex-
andrine Patriarch, and be anathematised as dangerous by the
Grand Lama of Thibet; and, finally, the Book placed on the Index
by the Roman Congregation.
Happy Thought. — Splendid advertisement: in large type. New
Book, just published, on the Index. Might get Typical Development!
on the Index; and then, if both could be excluded from MUDIE s
Circulating Library, it» fortune and mine, and POPGOOD AND
GKOOLLY'S, would be made.
Happy Thought.—Write to them, or telegraph at once. Shall give
up my baths, and run over to England. Tell DOCTOR CASPAR so. He
savs, "No; on no account. We must get it out of you." I tell him
I feel that it is coming out of me: apparently in the shape of a new
heresy, but I don't add this.
DR. MANNING'S FAITH PILL.
(Warranted Infallible.)
SAYS DOCTOR MANNING, in rebuke of Reason,
Appeal to History from the POPE is treason.
AU 's Gospel that a Pontiff ever said,
But so as the live POPE explains the dead.
Say the dead POPJS said two and two make five,
The live POPE says, "Read four." Believe the live.
Suppose a Council e'er called something white,
He rules they named it black, and he is right;
And when he 's dead he '11 still be never wrong.
Though the next POPB say " 'Twa* white all along."
Rule inexpugnable, which supersedes
All formularies, articles, and creeds,
Thus summed. Inquiring minds, no longer search
To know what doctrines holds the Roman Church.
The papal judgment nothing can deceive;
Wbate'er the existing POPE believes, believe.
To him submit your intellect and will;
uive him a blank cheque on your faith, to fill,
And cash it when presented, any day,
Explicitly, or else as best you may.
There 's bife in the Old Doctor yet.
LIVINGSTONE cut up and burnt for a wizard! Punch doesn't believe
a word of it. He's no more cut up than SIR RODERICK is at this
second edition of the Doctor's melancholy catastrophe. No; the
Doctor will survive the Congo witchfmders, as he has survived the
Mavite marauders; and expose the lies of the Portuguese traders as
he has those of the Johanna men. Depend upon it, a Living-Stone is
worth two dead men yet, and will comport itself as a Living-Stone
should—survive to write its own epitaph.
Two Linee.

THE Tunes that Offenbach so sweetiy sings,

HEADS AND BODIES.
DR. PINEL has been writing to prove
that guillotined heads may live three
hours after being severed. The Lancet
says this is nil bosh. Besides the
deoxydisation of the blood, which most
cause unconsciousness in ninety se-
conds, there is the shock to the nervous
system.
Perhaps: and yet there are facts
that seem to support DR. PINEL'S
view. Ask the Conservatives whether
a party may not live mouths without a head; and ask Ma. DISRAELI
whether the head of a party may not long survive the completest separa-
tion from the party?
ROME AND RAMSBOTHAM.
DEAR MR. Риясн,
You will be rejoiced to hear that the POPE has exquisitely
advertised the Fenians. They are renounced, along with all Secret
Societies, against either the Church, or any regularly constipated
Government, whether Protestant or Roman Candlestick. The Free
Amazons abroad, you know, are tee-totally different from the same
bodies at home. With us they give feasts, and it 's for the benefit of
publicans and dinners ; but here they only give trouble, and are always
perspiring. KINO FIGURE A MANUAL is himself beingpotted against
by these unscrofulous rascals'; and if the French left Rome, it s my
belief we should all be assessed in our beds, without asking with your
leave or without your leave, as the prophet says.
Talking of the POPE, you would like to know I dare say how he is
affiliated to the office of Chief Pastime to the Roman Church. It is
very simple. Any poor Monk or Fire, or regular or irregular Priest,
car. be collected to the post. They are in this respect like the French
Shoulùèrs, "every man Jack of whom," as a French genius said,
"carries the pattens of a Field Marginal iu his keepsake." The Carnavals
all meet in secret cockloft, and each takes a pill, with which he gives
his vote in an urn, just as they say the old Romans used to do with
beans, which reminds me courteously enough, that tea wasn't properly
unknown to the Heathens, or at all events coffee, аз they used urns
and beans, with which I am told, as also with chickweed, coffee is
expensively but I don't like to use this word; there are some
things better left unsaid; and, so far, I agree with the Riddle Com-
missionaires at home about the Lessons from the Topography; but
you know what I mean. However, this is only a learned inquisition,
and seems rather irreverent to the toothpicks of the present day in
Rome.
Of course the principal toothpick here is, whether the POPE is to be
declared Invaluable or not. Most lighting Candlesticks that I meet—
I mean by this the most belligerent of them—say that it will make no
real deference, because the great doctor, if passed, will only refine
clearly where the seat is. Аз a Protestant, I don't correspond all this,
and don't portend to, as some folks do who know 1езз, but say more.
The question, an eminent Elastic told me, is, whether the POPE is
invaluable ex catalogue; that is, out of his seat or in it. One thins h
certain, that, as a member of the English Church, whatever they say
here can't affect me, as we defer from tiiosi fondly and :'.; AÍJ.
What I said last week about my being wrong in the name of AUNT
O*NELLT, as confident of the POPE, is not palpable after all, because I
find, from JULIA'S reading to me, that, ages ago, there was a Consul
at Niece. So why not an Aunt note as a confident of the Roman
Pundit F By the way, AUNT O'NELLY stood as spinster to the young
Princess of Austria, the other day, in loo of the POPE.
There are many cemeteries in the churches which I have not been
able to subscribe, my space being dimity.
. YOU should see the Babel Guards in their gorging dresses: by their
S1de our Beetles and Beefeaters are nowhere ; though I 've heard that
our Gracious Suffering's—I mean Her Majesty's—Viiens-in-Waiting
have magnificent unicorns.
There are also Alberteers, whose costumes were designated by the
great ALBERT DEARER, or MITCHELL ANGELO, to whom I've eluded
before this, en parson, as the French say.
We went to see the differing rides ш the differing churches. All
Candlestick Priests all over the world say Mass; but there are divers
cemeteries according to the various rides. The French, the English,
and German Roman Candlesticks are all the same, but the Pandeans,
Greeks, Arabian, and Ammonian Bishops, though all Roman Candle-
sticks, nave peculiarities. My nephew-in-law, who has been studying
for the Church, is quite one of the diddleaniey, as the Italians say, in
these matters. He took me, and explained everything.
The Petrarch of the Pandeans was first: he has a beautiful beard,
and looks very vulnerable. The Ammonian Bishops wore their nitres,
studied with precious Jems. Of coarse I knew they were saving
Mass, but beyond that I didn't know what they were saying. There
are bowings and ginny-fluctuations (why so called I don't Know, for
they are most steady people), and in some cases the flashing of a large
candlestick all lighted.
The weather is bad; the murky is dcwn to centipede, whatever that
means. When I write again, which will be in about two weeks' time,
I shall have a great deal more to tell you.
When Lent comes on, the Romans give up balls and parties—(the
English ball was a very pleasant one here; I had a lovely jiew satán
for it, looped up with bookcases at every affable
pointy and I had also
some real Balancing Lace, and this, with my two rubies and my large
admiral, exerted the envy and animation of all my come-parrots: but
to return)—they give up the pumps and vanities of this wicked world,
and take to fastenings and absence.
A Fastening day is when they only take one meal with meat, and
two collections without anything except a little dry bread; but a day
of absence means only raining from flesh meats, and living on nothing
but fish. The old pilgrims used to eat shell fish, and put the jalaps
in their hats, as you may recollect having seen in the pictures. Good-
bye for the present. The post waits for nobody: then why is it called
the P08* f I am yours very truly,

FAL-LALS POR FEBRUARY.
Le Follet this month, discoursing of ladies' dresses, more than once
mentions "the body." It also refers to a "Marie Antoinette." Does
that mean a body without a head?
In detailing the "Fashions for February" Le Tollet also, with
respect to part of a ball-dress, states that :—
"A pouff of white tulle, тегу bouffant at the wai.it, ie held up by a wreath
of flowers matching thoee on the front."
Ponff! Bouffant! Ponff, pouff, pouff! What, have our fair friends
taken to wearing windbags P Eh, THOMAS DE CHELSEA? Why, the
fashions are airier than ever!
Finally, Le Follet announces that :—
"Black velvet has been mueh worn."
Do not, however, shabbily sympathising with husbands and fathers,
rejoice in the idea that it has been worn threadbare. Read on, and you
will learn that black velvet has not by any means been worn so much
as to have been worn out :—
"But it is giving way to lace or bright-coloured velvets and satine."
To the immense emolument of mercers, drapers, and milliners, at the
proportionate expense of PATEBFAMILIAS and MONSIEUR LE MARI.
Let them not grin, but smile and bear it.

ing wearisome muscular pressure, and galvanic, paralysing effects on the infant

The infant nerve must be in a singular condition if quill pens are
essential to prevent its being paralysed. We shall be careful not to
let this notion creep into our nursery, or MASTER JACKY will pretend
he is galvanically shocked whenever a steel penholder is put into his
hand; and MASTER FREDDY will be feigning to be stricken by paralysis
when his writing lesson comes on, and bis pen first makes a stroke.

PLEASANTRY POR THE SERIOUS PRESS.
IN these times of clerical controversy, it is really something as
pleasant as it is new to see the Greek ARCHBISHOP OK SYRA AND
TEÑOS fraternising with our own Archbishops and Clergy. His
Oriental Holiness actually went to Church the other day at York
Minster, attended by an Archimandrite and a Deacon of his own cloth,
and accompanied by the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, and the Dean and
Chapter. The Sock and the Record people, indeed, may have shaken
their heads when they read that :—
"At the usual time for the afternoon service a procession from the vestry
was formed, in which the Greek Archbishop bssumed hie vestments."
This demonstration perhaps appeared to our Protestant contempo-
raries to savour somewhat of Ritualism. But they were doubtless
reassured on further reading that, when the service was over :—
"The procession was then reformed."
Not only was the Greek Archbishop reformed, but the whole of the
procession, inclusive of English clergy too. There! Is not that a
triumph for the principles of the Reformation?
Emblem of an Illustrious Prince.
THE removal, in progress, of the scaffolding from the Albert Memo-
rial in Hyde Park, exhibits the whole upper stage of that structure
resplendent with gold. Thus is elegantly symbolised the matter of
fact that the PRINCE CONSORT had won golden opinions of all sorts
of men." This is the answer that may be made to any buffoon who
says that an edifice designed to commemorate Virtue has been made a
monument of Gilt.

MR. LOWE'S position is fully recognised in the title of the now

A GUSH OF ELOQUENCE.
"The League asked the Government to advance a million or two, not in
money, but in kind—in passage tickets to take the emigrante and their families
across the ocean, in food, and in tools until they could earn their own living,
and repay the loans made to them. He believed that if they gave free pas-
sages and six months' subsistence to emigrant families, from £16 to £20 per
head would be ample to clinch the bargain, and if with such inducements they
failed to find hundreds and thousands willing to go, the work of the League
would be done, and their consciences cleared on that matter."—Torren» at the
Mansion Ноше.
THERE was once a great Irish crator called FLOOD. There is one
now called TORBENS, which is Latin for Torrent.
No wonder we should be drifting towards a great Emigration
scheme, when we may say, with VIRGIL,
"Dat sonitum saxis et tolo vórtice TORRENS."
"Here 's TORRENS goiag in a header for it." Unless, indeed, the
first half of the line is to outweigh the second, and TORRENS, for all
the noise he makes, is only talking to stones, if rom what we hear
of the slow progress of subscription to the League funds, it look«
rather like it.

THE BEADLES AT BRUSSELS.
(Recitation in Character at a Town-Hall.)
The nation's representative at Brussels, and yer own.

The King and Queen of the Belgiums be-eld the worry sight,
On that occasion t'other day. as I presents to-night;
Cocked "at and buckles, staff and all, the same as wot you see:
And there was other Beadles, too, a'most as grand as me.
In Lord-Lieutenant's uniforms some ^Vestrymen showed fine,
But none warn't so imposin' to the forreners as mine;
No gorgeous Halderman or Mayor arrayed in chain and ROW ad,
Looked half like me, not one, though he looked full a million pound.
We 'ad a British Hofficer, a Colonel at our 'ead.
The caskit he presented, the address he likewise read:
The " Sag and famish" must be proud to reckon, if it can,
Among its gallaut ornaments that military man.
A bucket on my breast, as now, my nostrils did regale,
But ho! the hair of Royalty was sweeter to in-ale.
And sitch was our excitement that it hevery cheek made flush,
So has to give the countenance a tinge of crimson plush.
A gentle presparation caused our faces hall to beam,
And each eye wore a polish, and a glitter and a gleam,
That showed the honour bright we .felt in doin' sitch a thing
As 'twas for to present a testimonial to a king.
I busted through the circle and I kissed the Royal "and,
I knelt, for my Demotions 'ad got more than I could stand,
And in a fit of hextasy impressed a loud salute,
Fust on the Monarch's one and then upon his t'other boot.
And arter that I thought I wouldn't wash my mouth no more,
Until there corned the wittles, which my senses did restore:
1 felt a hadded relish, for a hexquisite quizzeen,
The ommedge I had gone and done the Belgiums King and Queen.
One drop of bitters only I had mingled with the sweet;
I'd got a pair of new shoes on, too tight, as pinched my feet;
The savin that Pride feels no pain is true I won't allow:
But I bore mine like a Briton with a smile upon my brow.
TABLES TURNED.
MR. PURCHAS, the Brighton Professor of Ritualism, has come off
victorious as far as the Vestments are concerned. He has been con-
demned in costs. Now must come the reprisals, for if words have any
meaning, then " shall be had in use," and /' shall be retained" make
the wearing of such vestments as were in use in the second year of
EDWARD THE SIXTH, not only not matter of choice or permissible, but
actually compulsory. The next step will evidently be a series of
actions brougnt by Ritualists against the Evangelicals for not comply-
ing with the law. "See how these Christians love one another!"
Can't they leave one another alone—surely there 's room for all P
'A Non-Representative Kan.
So the Americans are distancing the Birmingham manufacturers in
hardware, by producing better articles than theirs. The President of
the Board of Trade should consider his position with regard to his
constituency. It may not be necessary for him to seek another exactly;
but he would do well in endeavouring to put a stop to the practices of
duffers and dealers in shoddy, and other sham and. spurious goods.
Then, at all events, nobody wul be able to taunt him with being the
Member for Brummagem.
The Poet and the Piratee.
THE Poet-Laureate's Holy Grail is published in the United States at
the low figure of ten cents -•-••• 5d.! BURNS had his centenary festival
here, only the other day; SHAKESPEARE his ter-centenary. TENNYSON,
more fortunate, has Au ten-centenary festival, in his lifetime, among
our American cousins. Who shall say poets have no honour in these
THE SENSITIVENESS OF CAPITAL.
"PANIC in a Church," said MR. SCRIPPS, reading that announcement
on a newspaper bill, "Urn. Glad it isn't m the City."
VOTING BY ELECTRICITY.
SOMEBODY in Germany has invented a machine for enabling men in
Parliament to vote as quick as lightning :—
"A sort of lever, resembling the lengthened hand of a clock, is placed
behind the «eat of each deputy. By means of a V«7 which every rrember
receives at the beginning of the session, the h»nd can Be directed to 'Yes" or
'No' as soon as the President puts the question. The electrical apparatus is
worked by one of the ushers of the house by means of a handle."
This is certainly ingenious, and would save much loss of time in
taking a division, to say nothing of the nuisance of the scrambling to
the lobbies, which it likewise would prevent. But the instrument
would surely be enormously improved, if connecting wires were laid to
the houses of the Members, who might thereby be relieved from their
attendance at the House. What a blessing it would be for Gentlemen
of England to sit at home at ease, and telegraph to London how they
voted as M.P.'s! How short would be the speeches, when nobody
could be spoken to, except perhaps the Speaker! What a world of
words and worry would be annually saved, it Members were enabled
to vote by electricity, without assembling at St. Stephen's to hear
speeches which by no chance ever influence a vote!
NEWS FOR THE NOSE.
THE use of meerschaum cigar-tubes in Berlin must be limited, for,
according to the Bourse Gazette of that capital :—
"A charitable society has been formed in this city with no other resources
than the ends of cigars thrown away by smokers. W ith the produce of these
despised remuante it has been able to clothe completely sixteen poor children,
and even to give them some toys and sweetmeats at Christmas.
A 'Society that can make money out of the fag-ends of cigars is
obviously up to snuff. That article, as manufactured by those charitable
tobacconists, may or may not, be comparable to "Lundy Foot." But
being derived from tobacco-leavings culled from the streets and gutters
of Berlin, it might, at any rate, be not unduly denominated " Berlin
Blackguard."

P. A. TAYLOR v. ENTAILERS.
WE always thought MR. P. A. TATLOR one of the most magnanimous
of men. The landlords of England ought really to be very thankful to
him. In a speech at Leicester, the other day, he informed his consti-
tuents :—
"He would not wholly abolish property in land."
This is very kind of MR. P. A. TAYLOR. We are bound to say that
he adds, "but he would not allow it to remain in a family.". He could
hardly be expected to do THAT. The great point is, that he does not
abolish landed property all together.
Sub Jove Concilium.
THE Cardinal Legates superintending the Roman Council complain
that, notwithstanding the obligation of the " Pontifical Secret," the
substance of the speeches made, and of the business transacted in that
assembly, has appeared in the newspapers. Does not his Holiness
wish the Pontifical was as well kept as the Masonic Secret? The
Freemasons, whom he has condemned so frequently, could tell the
Holy Father the reason why his secret gets divulged. His Lodge, the
Council Hall, is not tiled.
A VERY INSTRUCTIVE LESSON.
THE Ritual Commission has been revising the Church Lessons.
They should add to the number DR. TKMH.K'S elevation to the
Bench, and the way it has been received by the laity on the one hand,
and the clergy on the other.

A DEATH-SHIP.
Os board the Stand, coolie immigrant "ship, from Calcutta to Demorara,
died in a passage of 123 days, ninety-eight out of 458 coolies, while thirty-six
were landed more dead than alive. Some fifty of these, the surgeon reports, were
in a low state of health when shipped, and would never have been embarked if
he had joined the ship when they came on board. Of these a large proportion
would probably have died under any circumstances. But the rest of the sufferers
died of scurvy, a disease that is impossible, if the Government regulations as to
provisions are observed. How comes this? Marry, easily, thus :—
"When lime-juice and fresh vegetables were »quired, the lime-juice was found to be
bad, and the whole of the onions and potatoes taken on board at Calcutta were rotten."
Now, onions and potatoes, good when shipped, may rot from heat and bad
stowage: not so lime-juice. We have immigration agents, inspectors, and pro-
tectors of emigrants at Calcutta. What have they to say to this? And what have
the owners who bought the bad lime-juice, or the cheaters who sold it, to answer to
this wholesale murder F Punch begs to echo, as loudly and emphatically as he
can, the words of the Demerara Colonist of January 7 :—
"What facts it is possible to ascertain here will no doubt be disclosed before the
Commission of Inquiry to be appointed; and we hope that the recuit of that inquiry will
form a ground-work for vigorous action on the part of the Indian Government. Apart from
the direct loss to the planters, and the great commercial importance to this colony of having
immigration conducted on the most humane principles and in the most perfect manner pos-
sible; it it not to bt tolerated that the live» of our fellow-creature» »hall be ruthletsly
»aerijieed, in order that dishoneit contractor» for »hips »tore» may make large praßt», and,
potnbly, out of their unjust gain», pay handsome douceur» to inspector», in consideration
of the official examination not being inconveniently minute."
One thing only can not be tolerated. That those whose business it is to inquire
into the crime of killing coolies, and to enforce responsibility for it, should be
allowed to take it coolly in a case like this.

ROME AND BAMSBOTHAM.
DEAR MR. Pencil,
I MUST write to you, though I 'didn't intend to this week.
But far away in a foreign climb one can't help thinking of friends at
home round the fireside, or "all round the Rigging," as the English
south-country prophet has it. Yes, dear Mr. Punch, to quoit again—
"Though lost to sight to mummery dear,"
is tbe ctse with me; for wherever I wonder there 's no place like
Home—not even Rome, which rhymes to it. If the Consul is dull (and
what can you expect? for sitting every day for so man v hours must
be тегу mutinous), sport is lively, and hunting tracks all the nobility
and gentry here.
There is shooting alio in the Punting marches, where I have heard
there is an abundance of snips. We had a peasant boiled with white
archduke sauce the other day, but whether shot here or not I don't
know. I have been rather invaded lately owing to eoldj and what one
easily catches here, as you may judge by the name, that is, Romeytism.
I didn't know this place was the urchin of that complaint; but one
lives to learn; and she is a lucky woman who learns to live. It attacks
the knees and the soldiers, and then gets into the arms.
Do you know that the Pope is very fond of a game of billets? It is
his one amusement; but he plays, my nephew tells me, without
any pockets, and only with canons (of his own Church, I suppose);
and therefore, so he says, you can't play either pool or periwigs on
these tables. His great Carnaval, AUNT O'NELLY, the Pope's tee-
¡ 1 ol.um, (I've eluded to him before,) is very much afflicted to getting
mosaics, which, I suppose, he picks up in the Jews' quarter here,
i and has large dealings with the virtuous of his acquaintance, which I
am delighted to hear.
The Italians, and all here, call The Great Holydays of the Church
Fetters, a name I don't like at alL For instance, there was a great
Fester the other day, and a large gathering in St. Peter's and other
Churches, when every one carried candles at the different funguses. It
was a very beautiful sight, and the wax must bring iß an enormous
profit to the Chandler of the Exchequer. Praps in Rome there is a
tax on Wax. 1 am fond of seeing Factories, and so shall take the
first opportunity of seeing the Waxworks here, which of course would
be unlike MADAME CRUSOE'S in London. I recollect a Waxworks
years ago done by clock-works, where a Roman wax shoulder in
armour was lost in the snow, with a Lion and his family, and would
ring a bell and pull corns out of his feet. You looked down at it from
a gallery above; but I 'm not quite sure, now, if it wasn't Scriptural,
and NATHANIEL in the Lion's Den.
Talking of that, what a deference between Pegging Rome and
Babel Rome of to-day! I have lately been reading all about it—that
is, about Ramilies and Rompus, and Nimrod, with the lovely Miss
Diphtheria. Of course that 's all falibus. But Rome must have been
grand under the Trumpers and Decembers. I remember a lovely
novel by SIR EDWARD BULLER LITTLE, now LORD LITTLE, about
Influenza, or the Last of the Tributes.
Later on, the Romans became very feeble and effervescent (I don't
think that's the word I want, but it means weak and womanly), and
were overrun by Moths and Sandals. You '11 see all this in GUBBINS'S
Decline and Fall of the Roman Umpire, which was written while the
monks were singing their hymns. However, you don't want me to
te\\that; only laterally there has been nothing to tell you about the
Economical Consul, for on this subject all the Roman Candlesticks are
as close as wax.
Some of the undersappers, the clerks of the Consul, did let ont a few
things they oughtn't to, out they were immediately oiled over the coals,
as the saying is, and were warmed by the Residing Carnaval against
ever doing it again; so I have no doubt they will profit by this ammu-
nition. As I do not portend to write about what I don't know, and
what nobody else can know, though there are clever people who, being
paid to say something in the papers, rely upon their own brilliant in-
tention and rivet imagination for anything which is all guess and not
true. You may always depend upon me, whenever, that is, you hear
from Yours sincerely,
LAVINIA RAMSBOTHAM, JUK.
P.S. Talking of religion in this cold weather, one is inclined to turn
Parson in Persia, and be a fire-worshipper and a disciple of Slowroaster,
the chief of the Majors. Dear, dear! all these cisterns of religion are
very confucious, as the Chinese say.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
I VISIT the Cathedral again, and I am confirmed in my first im-
pression. My theory (the heretical theory mentioned before) is, that
Mu.-/ is made in moulds; not of mould, bat м moulds.
Now 1 arrive at this, thus :—
On going into the Cathedral, High Mass is just commencing. I
struggle into a good place. We are all standing, and seats are an
impossibility. Duchesses and draymen elbowing one another, but this
by the way; only I do approve of this religious equality, and think it
worth noticing.
Before mass, all the canons, choristers, deans, and precentors walk
into the body of the church, and commence versicles and responses.
What they are I do not know, nor can I attend to the service, for, to
my utter amazement, 1 find that, from the chief dean or head canon,
or whatever he is, to the smallest man chorister (not boy) all are tho-
roughly well known to me. Yes, I recognise every one of their faces.
They are as familiar to me as possible. Yet I have never been to
Aachen before. Never. I have never been inside this Cathedral
prior to this occasion. No. But I know every one of the ecclesiastics
here by sight.
I find myself staring at one in particular. He is short and sharp-
looking, with a large mouth. He catches my eye: he can't help it;
nor can 1 help keeping mine fixed on him. We are mesmerising each
other. I feel that he is chanting his verses mechanically, and, as it
•were, addressing them chiefly to me. I wonder whether he is too
much mesmerised to move with the procession when it gets in motion
again. But who is he? Who are they P I have known only one
foreign priest in my life, and he was a Frenchman, and not a bit like
any of these. It breaks upon me, on my second visit, all at once.
They are all well-known theatrical faces, some familiar to me from
childhood, and indelibly engraved on my memory, and others known
to me in later years.
This small mesmerised priest (a minor canon he is), in a short surplice
and a tippet, is MR. DOMINIC к MURRAY—neither more nor less. The
Chief Dean is MR. PAUL BEDFORD, in a cope, assisted by Ms.
BUCKSTONE of the Haymarket, and Mu. ROGERS of the same company,
who hold two candles for him to read small print by. MR. BARRY
SULLIVAN, in a collar with kce, is scowling at his breviary; and MR.
HONEY, with his hair cut, is chanting, hard at it, at the bottom of his
voice. The others are all well known to me, only I can't remember
their names, except, by the way, MR. HORACE WIGAN, who stands out
from the rest, because he has lost his place in a large book he is carry-
ing, and has got into difficulties with his spectacles.
Hence my theory of Moulds. I find MR. DOHINICK MURRAY (let
us say, for example, as he was my chief attraction: he did sing so
energetically, and knew his part without a book !) in Germany as a
Minor Canon, in England as an excellent comedian. The same with
MR. BUCKSTONE, WIGAN, &c. Well, why not in India find the same
type of man among the Brahmins ?—that is, another loi oui of the same
mould.
*** DB. CASPAR has just called in late at night, and finding me at
my notes (above) on my new theory, has ordered me not to write any
more for a day or two, and to go to bed at once. _ CASPAR is an excel-
lent fellow, and really takes a personal friendly interest in a patient.
He is much struck with my theory of " moulds," and says he will call
in and talk it over in the morning. In the meantime (that is, between
this and breakfast) I am to go in for a hotter bath up to 28° Reaumur.
be very careful in diet, rely upon FriedrichshaUerbitierwasser, and not
write a line about this new theory till he gives me permission. Should
like to telegraph to my wife and tell her. Have sent to POPGOOD AND
QKOOLLY a telegram to this effect :—
"New theory. Moulds. Upset everything. Great Idea. Write
again. Will yon publish?"
DK. CASPAR insists on seeing me into bed. He says "the sulphur
is doing its work well." Something is coming out of me. What f
DYNGWELL looks in. "Well, old Cockalorum, got the papsylalls,
after all, eh P Doctor given you something golopshns. Rub it in."
This is his general idea of a prescription. "Good night."
DR. CASPAR prescribes douche and vapour baths. It '11 be all out of
me, whatever it is, in another week or so. I ask him if I may employ
my leisure in writing Typical Developments and the Theory of Origina-
tion, for POPGOOD AND GROOLLY.
He says "No, decidedly not." That instead I must devote myself
to kagelipiel—Kaffelipiel is skittles. I remember that DK. WHATELY
used to relax his mind by swinging on the chains of the post in front
of the archiépiscopal palace. CASPAR is right. Baths in. the morn-
ing, dinner mid-day, kapelspiel in the afternoon; tea in the evening,
and attendance at a concert or any musical meeting.
Plenty of music in_ Aix. I have now been here long enough to
observe that my first impressions were remarkably superficial.
I note down that for recovery of health, and generally for getting
anything out of you, there is no better place, I should imagine, than
Aachen.

A Settler for Manning.
THE ARCHBISHOP OF WESTMINSTER an advocate for mob-law!
If not, why does he want to bring in the Rule of the Masses P
Of one thing he may rest assured. England won't have it, any more
than France or Germany—however determined MANNING may be to
"do as Rome does."
TRUE.
A THOROUGH holiday for a man of business ought not to be marked
in his calendar as a Red Letter-day, but as an Unread Letter-day.
Happy TAouffii.—To write to MILBURD and forestall him in the joke
which I know he will make when 1 return about leaving my Aches
(Aix) behind me.
Second Happy Thought on Same Subject,—Set the idea to music. "The
Girl 1 Iff t behind Me," i.e. " The Aches I left Behind Me." Say to
MILBÜRD in my letter,—
"If you see any one who asks for me,
And doesn't know where to find me;
You may say that I "ve gone across the sea,
And left my Ai.'- behind me."
Copy this into three letters to other people, including one to FRIDDÏ.
The other people don't know MILBURD, so it will be all right.
The Vapour Bath.—Shown into a bed-room at the Neubad, white-
washed walls and window near the ceiling. Idea. Prisoner's dormitory,
still on the Silent System. Bath-man presently returns looking warmer
than usual, and says something that sounds like Der Damp Shift isfertish,
which I am right in taking to mean that the Yapour Bata is ready.
I follow him, in what I may term delicately my popular character of
Unfällen Adam, across a paved passage, cell-doors on either side (from
which I imagine people suddenly looking out and saying " Hallo!" as
MILBURD would, if he were here) to a small jam-closet without any
shelves, but with a skylight above.
In this closet is the case of, as it were, a small quaint old-fashioned
glano, only without the works and key-board. This is the Vapour
ill b. The Bath-man opens it: I see at once that I am to step in.
I step in. I see that I am to sit down over where the steam is comjng
up. I do, nervously. The Bath-man then boxes me in by closing
the front, and putting up a sort of slanting shutter, which only
leaves my head out of a hole at the top. I fancy the Bath-man rather
enjoys this, as his only chance of a practical joke. Hope he won't
think it fun, or do something stupid. He hangs my watch on a nail
opposite me and says, "fifteen minuten in der bad."
Happy Thought.—" Nein. Fiiaf."
He won't hear of such a thing. I don't like being left alone. He
smiles and nods, "Nice yarm P" he asks, and shuts the door on me.
It is varm, but it is not nice. How horribly slow the time passes. This
is like a Chinese punishment. I try to distract my mind. Let me see
what can I think about? Odd, I can't think of anything except the
time and the bath. Yes, one thing, "Can anyone see through this'
skylight P" No—ground glass. Suddenly I become aware of myriads
of little insects on the wall by my watch. Ants. They are nowhere
eke.—They are very busy. Suppose they were to forsake the wall, and
run all over my face and hair r I can't do anything. What is Ant in
German P I will complain when Bath-man re-appears.
He does re-appear on the instant—that is his head re-appe
smilingly, and asks " Nice varm?" I reply, "Jah." He adds "Ti
no?" and retires.
I have forgotten the Ants. Who was it, Вкпсв'ог WALLACE who
became King of Scotland by watching a spider P GALILEO made a
scientific discovery about the pendulum while watching a church-lamp
during a stupid sermon. These Ants might lead me to turn my atten-
tion to natural history, if I stay here long enough.
Odd: the Vapour Bath doesn't seem to be. taking anything out of
me. I thought it would be something fearful, and that 1 should yell,
half suffocated and parboiled, for help.
Bath-man's head again, "Nice varm? Time, no?" and disappears.
At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he enters with a warm
linen mantle. He unpacks the box (I could have travelled from here
to London in this case, labelled "with care," and "this side upper-
most") and I come out, like a character in a pantomime, when a
watch-box or something is strack by harlequin's wand and out steps a
boy dressed like NAPOLEON (only I "m dressed like nobody), and am
immediately clothed in the warm garment.
Then I follow Bath-man back to bed-room.
Here I am tumbled into a hot bed at once. Bath-man savagely
tucks me up. "Nice varm P " he asks again. "Heiss," I reply. "So
ist goot," he answers. He surveys me in bed. lam helpless. "Der
andere Mann," he informs me, "take dampf bad to-day."
He says this in an encouraging tone, as much as to impress npon
me that in all matters connected with the baths I can't do better than
follow the example of Der andere Mann.

TOO TRUE!
"SSE THEM Two COVES WITH THE RUMMY 'Атя ON I WELL, THEY'ЕЕ PARSSBS. THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL 'EM; AND THEY
WORSHIPS TUS Suif I"
"WORSHIPS THE Scry, DO THBY? WELL, I SHOULD SAY THEY 'AD A PRECIOUS EASY TIME OF IT IN THIS COUNTRY!"
THE KOYAL MESSAGE PABAPHBASED.
Mr LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
Ал proxies for our Queen to-day,
We have it in command to say
That it had been her full intent
To come and open Parliament;
But ill-health bars this happy meeting,
And so by us she sends her greeting,
And bids you all resume your tasks,
And do the things the Country asks.
With foreign powers all is peace;
And warn, mayhap, will one day cease,
If nation?, when they have a grudge,
Will beg a friendly state to judge
Between them, and, as now, prevent
The ready "sword's arbitrament."
GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,
The Estimates are nearly framed,
And Ministers have wisely aimed
To save the purse, but not abate
One jot of vigour in the State.
The Kevenue returns will show
The totals guessed by MR. LOWE.
Consult again, and, it" you can,
Devise some better, purer plan
For choosing those whose boast should be
That they are clean from Bribery.
MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
A Bill to deal with Irish land
Your calm attention will demand;
Shaped in the hope 1 hat by its aid
Life may be sacred, law obeyed,
And all the fabric made secure,
More strong, more certain to endure.
At last, perhaps almost too late,
You 're called to wake and educate
The million children of the poor,
Sinning, and starring at your door,
And daily growing up to be
Your danger, shame, and infamy.
Some legal topics now to mention—
The Courts of J ustice need attention;
And sojourners from other lands
Seek recognition at our hands;
Religions tests should disappear,
And not oppress beyond this year;
The incidence of local rating
Is quite a subject worth debating;
The rules by which the soil descends,
And those on which the heir depends;
Trade combinations, certain flaws
Found in our merchant shipping laws;
And, saddest scandal, public-houses,
Their drunken furies and carouses.
"1'ia hard to turn to crime again,
And end with what gives sharpest pain;
But outrage, guilt, and lawless force
Too long in Ireland hold their course,
While Justice finds but few allies,
And Hope in many a bosom dies:
Still we will trust in wiser ways
To bring back happier, brighter days,
And pray to have no need to say
She must be taught the sterner way.
PARLIAMENT will be shortly resumed.

CANDIDATES FOR THE CARNIFÍCATE.
ACANCT! The Weitem Mom-
ing News announces the re-
tirement of MB. CALCBAFT
from the high and important
office of which he has now
for so many years discharged
the duties with firmness and
dexterity. Oar occidental
and matutinal contemporary
does not enable us to state
the amount of retiring pen-
sion which will be awarded
to the ex-Executioner; but
we trust it will be sufficient
for the maintenance of the
dignity suitable to a Peerage,
should HEB MAJCSTT Ъе
advised to confer that honour
on a gentleman who, by his
steady and unflinching vin-
dication of the law. through-
out a lengthened career,
has achieved renown so
extensive t hat it has made his name a household word.
The estimation in which the arduous office so long and so worthily
tilled by MB. CALCBAFT is generally held may be computed from the fact
that no less than 134 applications have been made, by so many gentle-
men, for the lucrative honour of being appointed his successor. This
number has, by the authorities with whom that appointment rests,
been reduced to seven, from whom the final choice is to be made.
What principle will determine the selection, we do not know; but
analogy may suggest that of competitive examination. One of the
seven candidates, spoken of as peculiarly adapted for the situation
which they aspire to, is already a member of the Civil Service, being a
workman employed in the boat-house at the Devouport Dockyard,
named TOLL. Previously to his entrance on hia present occupation
MB. TOLL is said to have enjoyed a popular celebrity as a "clever pig-
killer." From this circumstance it may be inferred that the employ-
ment which he is now desirous of embracing will, should he succeed ш
obtaining it, be a labour of love. Phrenology suggests that MB. TOLL
is one of those persons whose brains are distinguished by an exceed-
ingly large development of the Organ of Benevolence, which in his
case causes the sentiment associated with it to take the direction of
desiring to minimise the inconvenience inflicted in the necessary des-
truction of life. Of course a pretty full allowance of Destructiveness
must be supposed co-existent with Benevolence to give .it this turn,
and a phrenologist would expect to find that combination exemplified
by the head of MB, TOLL. Hitherto Ma. TOLL has limited the exercise
of his modified humanity to conferring euthanasia on those lower
animals which by his dexterity in slaying he earned the name for clever-
ness above specified. He now, apparently seeks, installed in the room
of MB. CALCRAÏT, to gratify an amiably destructive impulse by ex-
tending the benefit of that peculiar cleverness to condemned criminals,
and dismissing them from life with "happy despatch."
The Western Morning News describes Ma. TOLL as a "stalwart
labourer." As such he is obviously just the right man to be entrusted
with the flagellation of garotters, a task which, considered as conducive
to the discouragement of cruelty, a truly benevolent man would rejoice
in performing.
It may be considered that Ma. TOLL'S personal qualifications for the
discharge of the Hangman's practical duties are such as to render it
advisable to dispense, in his favour, with the competitive test. The
literary attainments of Ma. CALCBAFT himself, as evidenced by his
lately published correspondence, bore no proportion whatever to his
professional skill. Perhaps Ma. TOLL would appear to disadvantage
ш a trial less calculated to prove a candidate's manual expertness than
the amount of book-learning at his fingers' ends. Among his rivals
there may be certain literary men, solicitous to add the emoluments of
a permanent office to a precarious income. Their number may include
writers for the Press, accustomed to advocate the retention of capital
punishment. Or, very likely some of them are critics who find con-
genial employment in the elaboration of severe reviews, and gratify
the same propensity in cutting up an author as that which,
in the old days of punishment for high treason, may have made
Jack Ketch delight m quartering a rebel These gentlemen would
probably be found to excel Ma. TOLL in erudition, although unequal
to him in manipulât ing a noose, or wielding a cat-o'-nine-tails.
We cannot quit this subject without calling attention to the vast
difference existing in the relative demand for two diverse situations
now vacant There are 131 candidates for the office of British
Executioner, whilst the Crown of Spain goes begging!
In conclusion, it may not be impertinent to propose that, in case
MB. TOLL should be instituted to succeed MB. CALCBAFT, the Herald's
College should furnish him with a fitting coat-of-arms, whereunto the
motto might be " Tollere Fitam."

THE ODOUR OF SANCTITY.—Pot-pourri.
MUTATO NOMINE.
WE have done away with slavery in the British Dominions.
"No slave can breathe where VICTORIA rules." There seems to be
one exception to the vaunt, and, strange to say, it is in Queensland of
all places. Here is LORD BELMORE'S account of the way free labour is
introduced into that favoured region, from the South-Sea islands :—
"A vessel goes to one of the cannibal islands, thickly populated, and under
the control of a chief. The chief wishes to reduce his population, and to
pocket the premium the trader is ready to pay for each labourer. He calls his
people together and eays, 'Here is a chance for thirty or forty of you to
engage with this trader.' The number required go on board. They are asked
whether they are willing to go away in the vessel; they declare their willing-
ness, and the terms of the law are apparently complied with.
"But they know very well that if they refuse to go they will be killed and
eaten. No comment seems to be necessary upon this, if it is true."
We decidedly agree with LORD BELMORE.
No other comment is necessary than that of MR. MURDOCH, of the
Emigration Board :—
"No authority short of the Imperial Legislature can put a stop to pro-
ceedings of this description, nor would an Act of Parliament be of much avail
unless cruisers were employed in the Polynesian Seas to carry it into effect."
Here would be a nice little job for one of MR. CHILDERS'S "flying
squadron." JOHN BULL would not begrudge the cost of a cruiser to put
down this kind of rascality, which is sowing the seeds in Australia of
that very curse of slavery which it has cost us, and other nations, so
much to get rid of.
Clerical Emancipation.
THERE is certainly one objection to the Bill about to be introduced
into the House of Commons for the relief of the clergy from their civil
disabilities. By empowering clergymen, who feel themselves unable
any longer to hold doctrines upon whose profession they were ordained,
to relinquish their orders, it will, if enacted, open a Church door to the
exit of perhaps too many of the most conscientious members of the
clerical body.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM "OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT."
PUNCH to the RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN BRIGHT.
MY DBAR JOHN.
I AM really sorry to near that you are forced by illness to
leave London and "the joy of battle with yonr peers" in Parliament,
just as the campaign is opening. Y ou can ill be spared. Not from your
office, for I fancy, entre nous, that you hate its trammels and its toils,
think its minutes a waste of years, feel its red tape tangling your
tongue, and its responsibilities damming and thwarting the flow of
your eloquence.
There might be some set-off for this, if you could believe in the good
of the work your office does. But you don't. If you had your way,
you would cut down to nothing its power of interference with Railway
Directors, Merchant Ship-owners, Harbour Commissioners, Dock
Trustees, Water Companies, and trade adulterations. You would
fain leave all these things, like the Trade whose name the office bears,
to the workings of the large philosophy embodied in such axioms as
"Caveat eaplor," "Every man for himself." and "Devil take the
hindmost ;" and as you evidently think small beer of your Office, and
are not particularly careful to conceal the opinion, it is probable that
the Office returns the compliment, and does not, qua office, think
XXX of yon as qua official head. As far as that goes, I dare say the
Office would not object to see your favourite principle of laisser^ aller
applied to you, and would let you go with the greatest equanimity.
But if the Office does not went you, you want the Oilice,—for a reason
I will tell you by-and-by.
And then we want you in the Cabinet, where you represent a
dînèrent force from any there. Not the democratic force by any
means. How amused and amazed at the same time you muet often
have been, my dear JOHN, when short-sighted old Tones assailed you
as a democrat, a leveller, and a destroyer. Of course / know better—
that there is no man who more thoroughly recognises the inequalities
of human lots, the varieties of power, whether power of money, power
of tongue, power of culture, power of organisation, or power of rule,
and the inequalities of privilege and position, which they draw after
them.
I know no man, my dear JOHN, who, in all he does and says, more
consistently asserts the wholesomeness of every man having his place,
and knowing it—or, if he doesn't, beinjç taught it. I know no man
who has more respect for things established, more reverence for rule,
more passion, may I say, for precedent. I sometimes think, my dear
JOHN, you are the most genuine Torv of my acquaintance—the poli-
tician, who of all our leading political personages, is most anxious to
find a precedent for everything, and having found one, to follow it—
about the most determined "Stander upon old ways," in the British
Parliament. Birth I know you don't, or rather won't, believe in, and
you don't much like high culture; and "society," with its rules and
restraints, rather bores you. I must confess I don't wonder at your
preferring a cigar, and a volume of Goethe to a white choker and
Belgravian small talk ; I do myself. 1 cannot help laughing when I
think of yon and ODGER, side by side in the House. 1 fancy I
can see the look you woulá give him. But you and I know how little
way these things go to the making of a democrat.
Slo; what you represent in the Cabinet is not the democratic idea—
it is an idea quite different from the democratic. It is the wish to have
the mass of men, women, and children in this country better taught,
better clad, better fed, and better mannered. A very different thing,
and, between ourselves, my dear JOHN, a much better thing, than
wishing to have them admitted to power which they arc nut. fitted to
exercise, which is the wish of your true democrat.
What you represent in the House is the вате wish, clothed in a
pre-eminent power ^of plain yet splendid, masculine yet mellifluous,
eloquence.
Your weakness has always been the difficulty you have in believing
that other people might wish this as earnestly and honestly as you did,
and yet take different roads to the same end. You have been in the
habit of looking on those who differed from you in politics, as DR. ,
JOHNSON did on foreigners, when he said to BOSWELL, "For all I have \
ever been able to see to the contrary, all foreigners are fools." You
have been apt to think that, to attain the objecta you desired, it was
enough to will them sincerely and strenuously; and that the slow
proirress of good legislation was owing to the folly or fainéantise of men
in office.
All this' your late experience of office has, I am glad to see, done
much to correct. I congratulate you on the visible fruit of that expe-
rience in your late speeches at Birmingham and elsewhere; on their
unfamiliar tolerance, reticence, caution, and comprehensiveness. 77/«/
is why I should be sorry to see you leave the Board of Trade.
If your Office has not benefited much by you, you have benefited
immensely by your Office; and whatever you benefit by, my dear JOHN.
the country benefits by. in the long run; for you are a power, ana
deserve to be one; and the wiser, more tolerant, and thoughtful of
others a power is, the better.
The Times expresses an earnest hope that you will retain office, even
if you are not able to resume its labours forthwith. I echo that hope —
but for your sake, as I have said, rather than that of your Office; and
for the country's sake and Parliament's that looks for and listens to
your words.
I hope you may retain Office, because, though you do not believe
in the good it does, it does one enormous good — it helps to school you,
and to transform you from an Orator into a Statesman; from a mighty
speaking power of the platform and the Parliament, into a shaper of
England's future, an agent in the elevation of her people, a strength-
ener of her power for good at home, and an ennobler and extender of
her influence abroad.
Thus thinking, my dear JOHN, you will not wonder at my regret for
your absence and its cause, and my anxiety for your return to Parlia-
ment, and above all. for your retention of Office. May you soon be
restored to strength by the pure and bracing air of Scotland, should
you go there. You fish, and good speed to your salmon-fishing.
As you slacken line to the plunge of some lively fifteen-pounder,
may you be reminded that the surest way to lose your fish is to " give
him the butt" too soon, and that the heaviest weight may be landed
with the lightest tackle by one who knows when to let go, and when
to "reel" in. It is the lesson, my dear JOHN, you most want; and I
don't know that a Scotch salmon-river is not about the best school for
teaching it.
And as "no play and all work" will make even JACK BRIGHT "a
dull boy," take a good holiday when you are about it, and come back
to us like a giant refreshed. Believe me, no one will more rejoice on
your return than your old and faithful friend,
'


BRIDGEWATER AND ITS ELECTION.
"Between the candidate and rotere there was a body of brokers or agents,
similar, on a small scale, to those gigantic 'ringe' that infest American
legislatures. • * * Out of thirteen elections, since 1832, not one has been
otherwise than corrupt, thanks to the happy morality of the Bridgewater con-
stituents, and the ingenious operations of the clique who turned it to account."
— The Pall Mall on " Bridgeirater Morality."
AFTER the revelations brought about by the Bridgewater Commis-
sion, there can be no doubt that, for illustrations of design in the
natural history of Electioneering, as in that of Creation, we cannot go
to a better source than the "Bridgewater Treaties" between bribers
and bribees in that now indignant and immaculate borough.

Those women are but few:

Consolation.
WE hear that CHANCELLOR LOWE has got in his Assessed and
Queen's Taxes wonderfully. Never were so few arrears known, though
the ingenious ROBERT has been screwing out of us two years' pay-
ments at one and the same operation. Fortune favours the brave. It
may have been a Lowe dodge, but it has brought in a high figure, and
has enabled us to pay for the Telegraphs without a loan. JOHN BULL
may have been what the sporting men call " wired " in the transaction,
but it is a comfort to think he hasn't been "milked" into the bargain.

No; Hiitory does not repeat itself. Tor CAMILLE DESMOULINS
she gives us ROCHEFORT; for L'Ami du Peuple, the Marseillaise; for
the Attack on the Tuileries, the Barricade of Belleville.
If History repeated itself, why was the Revolution of 1830 so
different from that of 1789 P that of 1848 so different from that
of 1830 P
Does not all this show that even France, ready as she is to "descend
into the street," is gradually learning the folly of flying to anarchy as
the escape from misrule, and declines to help the triumph of a ROCHE-
FOBT, even though it may be the downfall of a Louis NAPOLEON?
In '89 the Revolution cost the lives of a Royal Family, the best
blood of the nation, and a European War, and needed a NAPOLEON
THE GREAT to end it. In 1830 the Revolution cost three days' street-
fighting, and was closed by a Louis PHILIPPE. In 1848 the Revolu-
tion was set up by a coup de main, and put down by the Nephew of
the Uncle.
It looks like it.
ROCHEFORT has been sentenced, and Order continues to reign in
Paris.
ROCHEFORT has been arrested, and Louis NAPOLEON still sits at
the Tuileries.
Armed Insurrection can find no better head than half-witted
FLEURENS to flourish his sword-cane, and fire off his revolver at
nobody in particular. No stronger hands but those of the few score
gamins who threw up sham-barricades for the police to take, and
scampered before the sticks and small-swords of the Municipal
Guards.
It has not even needed the presence of soldiers to put down this
feeble fiz of revolutionary effervescence.
France definitely décimes to borrow ROCHEFORT'S Lanterne to look
for her honest man by.
She accepts OLLIVIER, and his coadjutors, and the substitution of
Parliamentary for Personal rule, as more beneficial means of restoring
her to the self-government she has been content for a time to abdicate,
and for which she can not better show her fitness than by her contempt
for such meneurs as ROCHEFOBT, and such organs as his Marseillaise.
A RISING FAMILY.
UNDEB the heading " A. Pluralist" the Times enumerates the good
tilines that fell to the lot in life of the REV. T. H. SPAKKE, son of an
ex-Bishop of Ely. Here is the list :—
"In 1818, as soon as he was of age to be admitted into priest's orders, he
was 'collated' to a prebendal stall in his father's cathedral, appointed to the
rectory of Stretham (value £756), and the sinecure vicarage of Littlebury,
Essex (value not known); in the next year hit father bestowed on him the
vicarage of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, the value of which is given in
Croc/cford'i Clerical Directory as £770; in 1824 he was nominated to the
Chancelloiship of Ely Cathedral; in 1827 to the rectory of Levcrington, Cam-
bridgeshire (value, according to the same authority, £2100). According to
"Crockford," his stall in Ely was of the annual value of £307, which he held1
for upwards of fifty years; and for nearly thirty years he was also rector of
two other livings, Gunthorpe and Bale, near Thetford."
Can we have a better illustration than is furnished by such a list of
the proverbial tendency of " Sparks " to " fly upwards?"
On Taxation.
A TAX on powder is fair. Those who use powder as a luxury won't
mind paying their shot for it. The tax is only on powdered footmen:
babies, when powdered, don't come under the Act.

M. ROCHBÏORT is not the right man in the right place. M. ROCHEFORT is in

ihould be impeached for inciting to civil war."
Instead of being- immured in a French prison, M. ROCHEFORT ought now to be
figuring in a British theatre. The face of M. ROCHEFORT should be overlaid with
white paint, patched and streaked with scarlet. His eyebrows should be enlarged,
and his head crowned with a coxcomb. His attire should consist of a frock and
knickerbockers of motley, clocked stockings, and red-morocco shoes. Thus
equipped and embellished for the excitement of mirth, M. ROCHEFORT should be
engaged nightly at one of the theatres in affording amusement to the youthful
part of his spectators, in particular making a point, when collared in a street-
row, of upbraiding the police with having created the disturbance.
"I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl,"
—says SHAKSPEARE'S Bichará III.} and so M. ROCHEFORT might say if he were
a person of Bichará?» dramatic dignity; but, being what he is, he would act more
in character with himself by playing another character, and in the language of
that character, at one of the stage wings, taunting a guardian of the public peace

PUNCH, OB THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WOMEN'S WORST DISABILITIES.
rDKKMAU COWEN, the
other day, presented
to the House of Com-
mons a petition from
Newcas tie-on-Tyne,
"to remove the disa-
bilities of women." It
is to be wished the
House of Commons
could. Women are
subject to disabilities
other than political;
and what a blessing
it would be for them,
and those who are
charged with them,
especially for men of
moderate circumstan-
ces in the higher and
middle classes, if Par-
liament could remove
those! The POPE is
often ridiculed for his
continual use of an
expression declaring
disability in the sense
of inability; want of
power to do a thing.
But women in general
(not you, sweet rea-
ders.) are in the habit,
~ much more frequently
than his Holiness is,
of saying поя poisu-
>ans. "I can't take
exercise." "I can't
touch that horrid me-
dicine." "I can't go about in those old things." "I can't dress under so much
a year." "I can't do without a carriage." "I can't live any longer in this house."
"I can't manage without so many servants." "I can't eat this." "I can't drink
that." "I can't do "—anythjng whatever that implies the least degree of self-
command. Unhappily no legislation can relieve women of their most grievous
disabilities; those which all come under the general head of disability to act in

any way against the bidding of their unreasoning incli-
nations. If it could, and the House of Commons would
pass an Act to abolish all those female disabilities, poor
Paterfamilias would immediately have the pleasure of
seeing his wife and daughters, habitually independent of
cabs, walking to the theatres and to evening parties as the
Pall Mall suggested the other day, in sensible short
dresses and mud-proof goloshes of India-rubber.
EIGHTY MILES AT A STRETCH.
TES following paragraph, extracted from a contempo-
rary, must be supposed to have originally appeared in an
American paper :—
11 A MATCH.—Two daughters of a thrifty farmer in Illinois,
fifteen and seventeen years old, completed on the 17th of January
the task of walking eighty milts within twenty consecutive hours
for a prize of 100 dolían. They had one hour and thirty minutes
to spare."
Never be satisfied with driving your nail through your
board ever so far. Clinch it. The statement that two
girls under eighteen walked eighty miles within twenty
hours running (аз we may say without Irishism) is a good
whack with the hammer. The assertion that they had
one hour and thirty minutes to spare is a clincher.
One would like to know the name of the " thrifty farmer
in Illinois" whose daughters are said, as above, to have
shown themselves such wonderful pedestrians.
If they are truly said to have done so, and take after
their father, he is appropriately named if the name he bears
is that which was borne by the author of the Pronouncing
and the Rhyming Dictionary. It is a name which, at any
rate, the foregoing story of a long walk will have occa-
sioned many men to pronounce on reading it—WALKER.
A Long Step in the Bight Road.
PUNCH begs leave to congratulate the Right Honour-
able W. E. FORSTER on his bold, wise, and comprehensive
Education Bill. He has taken a longer stride, by that Bill,
towards securing the schooling of every child in England
than two leagues—or seven leagues either.
RARE NEWS FROM ROME.
THE lively Correspondent of the Post at Rome, describing certain
ecclesiastical evolutions performed by the Fathers on their way to the
Council, presents us with the following brilliant sketch in pen-and-
ink :—
"Groups are thus formed of endless variety, both as to attitude, expre«-
eion, and colour, for the flaming Cardinal kneels down (on a cushion presented

This is a vivid picture, and comprises one peculiarly striking object:
the "gorgeous Nestorian." He is a lion indeed, a lion lying down
with lambs, unless he may rather be considered a wolf in the fold, but
then how can the sheep-dogs let him remain there P Perhaps, however,
the Nestorians, heretics ever since the fifth century, have quietly re-
nounced their heresy within the last few months, and squared it with
the Holy See.
A Lesson for Ireland.
SOME ignorant Irish, old England to fire,
Elected O'DosovAN Ross A, ESOUERE;
But this Fenian bold is a felon de se,
And, civilly dead, has no life as M.P.
*Tis a maxim, the truth whereof each one allows here,
That you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear:
Of a similar truth, too, there needs no debater,
That you can't make an M.P. out of a traitor.
A Liberal Measure.
MR. PLIMSOLL, M.P,, wishes to compel all Railway Companies to
provide hot-water bottles for Third Class passengers. A working man,
not yet in Parliament, says that he would move as an amendment, that
after the word "hot * be inserted the word "brandy."
LITERARY SMASHERS.
ANOTHER villainous case of word-coining is reported from America,
A person there is spoken of as having "suicided." The coiner of this
verb no doubt belongs to the vile gang who lately issued the word
"burgle," meaning to commit a burglary, and the still more hideous
terms "excurted and "injuncted," which have recently been
suffered to pass current in the States. In the same false mint, we
doubt, not, have been coined such words as "cabled," "wired," "do-
nated," "deçutated," " interviewed," "crated," "reliable," "rendi-
tion." "walkist," "eatist." and the like, with which the Queen's English
has lately been in Yankeeland defaced. Such wretched counterfeits as
these for genuine sterling English are, with scarcely an. exception, first
uttered in the newspapers; and if editors declined to pay for any article
wherein they detected this false coinage, the literary smashers would
be literally smashed. __
NEW STYLE.
THE Times, in its notice of MR. BELLEW'S Hamlet (to which Mr.
Punch heartily wishes much success), has the following remark:—
"There are so many persons in this country who run after everything
theatrical, save a theatre itself, that this approximation to a theatre,
which may be compared to the position of an asymptotic curve, may
prove powerfully attractive to a large class."
"An asymptotic curve I"
If this sort of writing is coming into vogue, it will be necessary for us
all to go through a course of mathematics before attempting to master
the dramatic criticisms in the papers.
An Uncertain Title.
So confused and complicated were the interests involved in the
recent litigation about the revenues of St. Paul's School, founded by
DEAN COLET, that it had at last oome to be described as the What-fyt-
Cokt foundation.

HUNGRY reader—still more, cold and hungry reader—if Punch counts
among his readers any so vulgar as to be cold and hungry, would you
be comforted F Read here—and wann yourself in the winter garments
of your betters.
La Misère, allow me to introduce you to La Mode!
"Toilette! de visite appear to have arrived at the laet stage of magni-
ficence, the richest stuffs Deine now garnished -with the richest trimmings.
Take, for instance, a robe of golden hrown velvet, and warm grey satin made
with a long train au manteau de cour, the satin jupe having two flounces
coquilles, the uppermost of satin trimmed with a delicate interlacing passe-
menterie, the lower one of velvet edged with a gathered border of black lace.
The velvet train is trimmed all round with bands of rich passementerie, that
gradually widen towards iu extremity, headed by ruches of grey satin."
Or this—
"An equally elegant costume is in violet velvet and satin of a lighter shade,
the under jupe of velvet being trimmed round the bottom with a deep entredeux
of black velvet on white satin, bordered above and below by a floss silk fringe.
The upper jupe i traîne is in satin, and raited at the sides behind coques of
violet velvet and black lace. Long basques trimmed with rouleaux of velvet,
bordered with deep black laue, hung from the back of the corsage, and, joined
together at their ends, follow the sweep of the train. The tight sleeves have
j.nil's on the shoulders and slashes of white satin veiled with buck lace."
Is it possible you are still sad and sick and shivering P Then put
this on your back and warm you :—
"One toilette, entirely of velvet of a warm violet shade, is made with a short
jacket bordered with chinchilla fur, a band of which is arranged to form a small
simulated pelerine behind. The cull's of the tight-fitting under-sleeves,
together with the openings of the loose hanging sleeves, which droop almost
level with the knees, are trimmed en suite. The perfectly plain tunic has a
fur border, and the under jupe has a deep band of fur some few inches from
the bottom. A velvet muff bound with fur and a velvet toqne rimibed with
a grey feather, secured with a large gold buckle, complete a costume the
elegance of which rivals its simplicity. A toilette in Carmelite velvet,

with heauiiij;, has its upper jupe raised at the sides by interlacing cords and
tassels; while the jacket, which is open behind to accommodate the slight
bouffante, has a couple of pointed basques falling down rather low in front and
• vaporous-looking lace full at its open collar."
There! Isn't that nice wearing!
And as one gopd turn deserves another,
Let me next introduce La Mod« to La Misère, a seasonable ac-
quaintance in this fine bracing weather.
Here is an inquest at Charing Cross Hospital last Wednesday, on
JOHN SUTTON. aged fifty-three, coach-wheelwright, sober and industrious
—out of employment the last four months—supported a sister while
in work—nothing to eat for the last few weeks but dry bread and
weak tea, procured by pledging clothes and furniture. MARY LOVE-
LAND, a widow, called on the brother and sister last Thursday—seeing
the man was ill for want of food, she asked the parish doctor to come
to him. Doctor's assistant came and saw him, and said he had better
come into the house on the following day. But the story loses by con-
densation. Let MARY LOVELAND tell it "to the bitter end," in her
own way :—
"At the request of the assistant she went in the afternoon to the surgery
of the workhouse for some medicine, when she told the doctor the man was
dying for want of food, and asked him to give her an order for some beef-tea
or some oatmeal. He said there was no oatmeal in the house, but made no
remark about the beef-tea. He said the deceased had better come to the
house the nezt morning. He did not say anything about sending a conveyance.
On Friday morning the deceased bad a small piece of dry bread to eat, and at
11 o'clock he left home with witness and his sister to go to the workhouse. He
had got but a little way, when he fell down in the street insensible, and was
taken to the hospital in a cub by a policeman. The cab-fare was paid by Mu.
KimAUIJS, a draper in Ann Street, who saw the deceased fall. MB. MITCHELL,
house-surgeon, said deceased woe admitted into the hospital about 12 o'clock
on Friday morning last. He was insensible, and in a most exhausted state.
Every attention was paid to him, but he never rallied, and died at 10 o'clock
in the evening. The result of a post mortem examination showed that
deceased was suffering from inflammation of the lungs, the other organs being
healthy. There was no food in the stomach, nor a particle of fat on the
body, which was much emaciated. The want of food and exposure to the
cola had accelerated the inflammation of the lungs, which was the immediate
cause of death. After some deliberation, the following verdict was returned:
—" That the deceased died from inflammation of the lungs, produced by ex-
posure to the cold and the want of food."
This is one of four inquests in the same coroner's district on the
same day, ending in effect in the same concise verdict: "Death from
want of food, and privation." And there has been no day this last
week without several such inquests.
No wonder the St. Faneras Guardians the other day got angry with
the aggravating medical man who would persist in giving the sick
poor certificates of "exhaustion from want of food." As if lit«! was
a disease! As an acute Guardian said, "for a Doctor to give such a
certificate was no better than washing his hands of the patient alto-
gether"—and flinging him "dead" on the rates.
Ah—there's the rub! There wouldn't be so much harm if the
doctor would only wait till the pauper's dead before flinging him.
But unfortunately you can't always hit it so exactly as you did in the
case of JOHN SUTTON, where the man died within eight hoars of his
admission to the House, and never cost the parish a meal. The St.
Paneras Doctor needn't be in such a hurry—if he wasn't bent on
spiting the guardians!
PAUL PRY AT ST. PETER'S.
IT seems that a jackdaw in ecclesiastical peacock's feathers has
really, by the complicity of a Roman tailor, contrived to creep into the
(Ecumenical Council. Who is he? Perhaps some contemporary's
Own Correspondent. Having been found out, he was sent to prison,
where he remains. Suppose he is a British subject. Shall we nave to
fit out an expedition tor his release, dealing with Pío NONO as we
dealt with THEODORE P We could do it without fear of an European
war. NAPOLEON would be only too glad of an excuse for leaving the
POP« to fight any battles which he might provoke as a King by the
exercise of his temporal sovereignty over representatives of foreign
Powers. Nor need a Roman expedition cost the Income Tax-payer ten
millions. We might make it pay its expenses by plundering the
Vatican.
But " No Admittance Except on Business" is the rale at the Papal
Council; and his HOLINESS has a right to enforce it. And should we
say that a Briton is everywhere {.'iris Romania, the Holy Father may
shut us up as well as our countryman. He can say that he perfectly
agrees with us, regards that prying British subject precisely as a
Roman Citizen; and has served him accordingly. Which nobody can.

Punch won't judge betwixt you, which should have giv'n way,

CARVING HIS WAT TO DISTINCTION.
"A new weeklv Journal is announced—The Knife and Fork—to be con-
ducted by 'FIN-ВЕС,' the Author of ' The Epicure'i Year Book!"
A PIECE of news that makes the mouth water, but we should like to
have a little more information about this new Magazine for our table.
Will The Knife and Fork appear with plates? If so, how many cuts
will each number contain? Will it be published in the Edgware Road?
"FlN-Ввс " is a man to play a capital Knife and Fork, and knows how
to handle his subject thoroughly well, so we may expect from him a
perfect feast of good things, served up in first-rate style, for which
we shall be very willing to fork out any reasonable sum. But is there
not a rival in the dining-room, in the Food Journal advertised as also
about to appear P
COLD AFTER CANDLEMAS.
WITH ice-bergs floating down the Thames in February, after a
cloudy Candlemas Day, we must modify the old Leonine verses relative
to that festival, and may say :—
Sol te condebut, Maria purificante;
Nee minor est gloríes post fatum quàmfuil ante.
We may also reform, our old vernacular doggerel on the same subject,
as thus :—
Last Candlemas Day was dark and foul,
But the winter by no means did go last Yule,
If Candlemas Day should be bright and clear,
That may or may not be the case next year.
A Good Bound Sum.
A GENTLEMAN has offered a bet of £500 that the earth is not rotund,
as it is generally supposed to be in the best circles, a Fellow of the
Geographical Society has accepted it, and "the editor of an old estab-
lished London paper has been chosen umpire."—Tie Globe, of course.

EFFECTS OF THE IRISH LAND BILL.
No more agitation! Righteous legislation

On prophetic vision dawning, plains Elysian

Bogs are disappearing 'mid vociferous cheering;

Fields of corn and clover hill and valley cover,

And there's grass for mowing, and there's cattle lowing;
And tobacco, growing, blossoms like the rose.

We are glad to hear it, and hope the new Chief Inspector will keep
a Wary eye upon our comfortable and luxurious cabs and omnibuses.
May we ask for another appointment to be made ? A Chief Inspector
of Public Crossings. Such a functionary would be very useful now
that the season is commencing, and by his supervision might enable
many persons to perform the journey without danger to their lives-
and boots. But perhaps, as regards our boots, the Shoe-black Brigades
have vested interests with which no interference can be permitted.
Invidious.
CYNICAL and republicanly minded people, seeing how the PRINCE

BETTER DAY, BETTER DEED.
J.i. know that the
14th of February
was St.Valentine's
Day.
What a neat and
graceful tribute to
the anniversary is
HER MAJESTY'S
gracious message
to her bring Com-
mons, printed in
the Parliamentary
paper of the day—
that ehe means to
give directions, as
the Commons
mean to provide
the cost, for "ob-
serving the transit
nf Venus" in
1874. For besides
these extraordi-
nary transits of
Venus, the obser-
vation of which
need« public grants to pay for, and CAPTAIN COOKS, SIR JOSEPH
BANKSES and Sin JOHN HSRSCIIELS to carry on, we have the annual
transit of Venus, which is observed by the whole corps of letter-
carriers, at the cost of the pennies of the million, and that is the
passage of love-letters through the post on the 14th of February.

SECRETS IN THE AIR,
AN ingenious member ot the Boyal Irish Academy, DR. GEOROE
SIGERSON, has been using the microscope to make the air we breathe
give up its motes. He has analysed in this waj, "sea breeze," and
country air," and " drawing-room air," and " city air,"—if the name
must be given to the foul mixture of mucus, granite-dust, quartz
epiculte. cotton fluff, soot particles, epithelial scales, and crystals of
ammonia, which the wretched inhabitants of cities are forced to inhale
by way of long-pabulum.
No air, we find, but may be made to render up its secrets. The sea
breeze snows us its health-giving crystals of chloride of sodium and
sulphate of magnesia, iU visible traces of iodine and bromine, if we
push our questioning far enough. The country air reveals to us
its fragrant treasure of daisy pollen and fungus spores, its plant
crystals, its moth scales, its spermatozoids of ferns, its ova of ani-
malcules, its very dew-drops, one, says DR. SIGERSO», "with a
lively monas disporting in it," within two hours of its gathering in
its leaf-cup.
The idea is worth developing. Why, if the ordinary microscope can
show us all this in the material motes of the air we breathe, should not
a more powerful instrument, and a more delicate analysis, carry us a
stage further, and enable us to detect in the air its subtler qualities—
tay the proportions of weariness, worldliness, and worship, that make
up the air of Church; or the element« of patriotism and pomposity,
vanity and verbosity, the filaments of red tape, and the dry dust of
precedent, that blend in the air of the House of Commons f How
interesting to have the air of Convocation analysed, before and after
BISHOP TEMPLE'S explanation, for a determination of its quantities ol
odium theologian» and latent zeal-heat, or to reduce the atmosphere
that gathers like a fog over Exeter Hall platform into its chief consti-
tuents, bitters of bigotry, and dust of declamation, and to have made
palpable, through all these, that small modicum of salt of Christianity
which keeps the mixture sweet enough not only for bare breathing,
bat even for supporting healthy existence, and propagating good
works. Think of the value of an analysis of the air of a St. Paneras
board-room, side by side with one of a St. Paneras sick-ward—the
embodied emanations of guardian selfishness and penny wisdom by
those of pauper sluttiness, starvation, and suffering 1
Surely, we might all learn something to our advantage from such a
making visible of that which goeth out of us, such a palpable mani-
festation of what spirit we are.

NEW CUEIOSITIES OF LITEEATUEE.
IT it is a weakness, it is a pardonable one, which leads us to regard
»ith interest the little personal articles, of use or ornament, that
lave belonged to the great men and great women whose works we
admire and whose memory we worship.
Who can survey, without emotion, POPE'S toothpick, which, be-
jueathed by the poet in the last codicil but one to his Will, to Á.BBUTHNOT,
Tree from legacy duty, is now amongst the most treasured possessions
of the College of Dentists in Glasgow P What are our thoughts when
permitted to handle the penwiper MALTHDS used the morning he com-
pleted his Essay on Population, within sight of the towers and steeples
of Bethnal Green; or to take into a reverent palm NEWTON'S tobacco-
stopper, formed out of a fragment of the apple-tree under which he was
sitting ш September, when the Yorkshire codling fell at his feet, and
unfolded to him his grand discovery of the laws of good society?
MHS. BARBAULD'S goloshes, worn by her that memorable and rainy
evening when she accompanied her sup-father to drink tea with his
stockbroker, who was afterwards in reduced circumstances, and there
heard the news of the capitulation of the Island of Formosa to the
allied fleets, under the command of COMMODORE Т ни N к i ox, C.B.; the
shoestrings COWFER tied the day the thought first struck him, as he
was watching the company leave the London Tavern, of writing his
best known poem, The Flask; the only pocket-handkerchief of MIL-
TON'S extant, which after remaining as an heirloom in the family of his
laundress for many generations, was parted with by her sole surviving
descendant, under pecuniary pressure, to the Smithsonian Institute at
Washington; Fox's brush, now in the liunterian Museum in Lincoln's
Inn Fields; MBS. SIDDONS'S favourite false tooth, BENJAMIN FBANK-
LIN'S egg-boiler. JOHN WILKES'S roasting jack, Miss EDGEWOBTH'S
garden-roller, FANNY SUBNET'S curl-papers, BURNS'S shoehorn, the
tassel of JOHNSON'S nightcap,—these and a thousand other cherished
relics and mementoes, to be found in our various public and private
collections, can never cease to be objects of veneration alike to the
dwellers round St. Paul's and the Wrekin, and the enthusiastic pil-
grim who bends his steps hither, with letters of introduction and a
return ticket, from the weltering shores of the Mississippi or the blue
waters of the far Hydaspes.
The unaccountable partiality of great writers for those of their
works not held in the highest estimation by the best Judges (including
the Courts of Law now sitting) has often been the subject of wonder-
ing remark. It was not his Inquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful, nor
his He/lections on the French Revolution, nor yet his Speeches, that filled
EDMUND BUKKE with just pride, but the little Cooker]/ Book to which
lie devoted all his leisure moments, when permitted to retire to the
villa near Wolverhampton, where REYNOLDS and SIR JOSEPH BANKS
found him, in в nankeen suit and wide flapping straw hat, feeding his
turkey poults with Indian corn, at luncheon time.
Similarly SMOLLETT was indifferent to the praises bestowed on
Humphrey Clinker and his other novels, but tell him of your admiration
of his Suggestions for the gradual diminution of the National Debt by
Hydraulic Pressure,, and you found your way to his heart and his
dinner-table immediately.
Amongst our poets, the extraordinary preference shown by GRAT
for his Ode on the Vanity of Testamentary Expectation», over The Pro-
gress of Pottery, the Elegy written in a Country Workhouse, and all his
other compositions, is a matter of history; and the same strange bias
led DRYDEN to depreciate everything he had done in exaltation of hie
Rake's Progress and Don Casar de Bazan.
Simple in his tastes yet careful of his personal popularity, penurious
in his habits yet always ready to lend an ear to operatic music, sound
in his understanding and on his feet, of great discrimination in the
choice of friends, but without the least discernment of the different
joints of butcher's meat, pleasant and pock-marked, garrulous and
garish, with nothing false about him but his-teetli, and no expectations
from distant relatives, that amazing scholar, ISAAC CASAUBON, with bis
corpulence, his industry, his indifferent digestion, his universal know-
ledge, ranging from.the private life of the Troglodytes to the curative
properties of sarsaparilla, never passed a day—no not even in the
busiest period of his life, when engaged on his greatest work, De
Gvstitut non disputandum, which has elicited the enlogiums of such rival
scholars as the great SMECTYMNUUS and the incomparable BESZINE—
without taking refreshment.

IT 's a carious fact, but true, that the POPE has no Navy,

of PETEB, and of course all the Garnirais and every Roman all over
the world glories in being in the same boat. My nephew, who belongs

himself, says the bark is holy. "Well," says I, "then how about the

His M AJF.STY THE К INC; of PRUSSIA, in his Speech from the Throne
addressed to the North German Parliament, expressed his "great
gratification" on account of the completed preparation of a penal code
for North Germany. That, no doubt, is a good job, and one not con-
cluded too soon for North Germany and the Prussian Sovereign.
Before a penal code had been devised for North Germany, Denmark
had been robbed of her Duchies.
TOTAL ECLIPSE.
M. LKVF.RRTF.R has been dismissed from the Imperial Observatory,
Paria. M. LEVKKKIER'S star is clearly not in the ascendant.
CUT IT SHORT.
WITHOUT pretending to be weather-wise, we may venture to predict
the speedy commencement of a long season of drought. The news-
papers, for months to come, will be full of prolix Parliamentary
speeches on the question, already settled in everybody's mind, of the
Irish Land Bill. We must also expect to be bored with an enormous
quantity of dreary jaw on the immensely important, but equally dry,
subject of Education. Why can't the measures of Government,
respecting both this and the other thing, universally approved of, be
passed without gabble f If oar representatives will spare us their
customary talk, they will enable Ministers to get through the work
which MB. GLADSTONE and his colleagues want, and the country wants
them, to do; and will preclude an awful massacre of Innocente.
When it is clear that a Bill must pass amid tremendous cheering,
Members might as well say at once to Ministers—" We will leave it
to you, gentlemen."
High Notes.
"A few voices of refinement wanted (ladies and gentlemen only), for a
really aristocratic choir."
THE wording of this invitation leaves it doubtful, whether by " re-
finement " is meant the quality of the voice, or the "quality" of the
vocalist. Until this uncertainty is cleared np, we shall not give the
"really aristocratic choir" the advantage of our splendid organ. And
a voice of such power ы ours would be of immense assistance to
them, for of course they can never intend to sing anything low.
Hard to Accomplish.
WHEN, from time to time, we read in the Courl Circular that
So-and-so was introduced to HEB MAJESTY and delivered np his "stick
of office," we invariably find ourselves wishing that some one would
deliver us from those Sticks in office still to be found in the Public
Service.

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
1 í F, кг. that I ought to be dreadfully, unbearably, hot, but I 'in not.
There seems, as I lie on my back, bound down by sheets under a huge
feather bed or two, to be a sort of infernal jingle of a rhyme in my
head.
I ought to be hot,
But I 'm not, I 'm not.
I will if I can,
Like Der andere Mann.
fot;
Who ú this Andere Mann? I 've never seen him. Perhaps he is
in the next cell to me. Wish I could sleep. Should like to, but
mustn't; at least CASPAS says it's bad to do so. Must stay in for forty
minutes. Impossible to read, even if one had a book. Why don't they
invent some plan of fixing up a book before you f Wish KHIIIDY were
here: she 'd read to me. Devoted wife, reading to vapour-bathed hus-
band. I am not very warm. Wonder il it 's doing me good F or harm?
Bath-man looks in. He takes a towel, and wipes my forehead:
apparently without any satisfactory result, as he is more disgusted
with me than ever.
"Nein," he says, "nix tarn" Then in a tone of expostulation,
"Der andere Mann much norm: neat der andere Mann."
I am getting angry: I feel it. I am annoyed. What do I care
about Der andere Mann's state of heat F I wish I knew the German
for " comparisons are odious," 1 'd say it. All I do is to restrain my
impatience, and merely say, "Oh, very odd. Twenty minutes," by
which I mean that in that time I will leave this bed, whatever happens,
much varm or not. Begin to think 1 've bad enough of it.
Ten Miautet ofler the abate.—Interval of thinking of nothing, except
trying to recollect poetry, and failing. Bath-man enters. He is
puzzled by my comparative frigidity.
"Der andere Mann," he begins again, "much norm: steal, der
andere Mann, much neat." This in a loud tone, and as if at a loss to
find terms to make me comprehend the admirable conduct of this
infernal Andere Mann; "but," be goes on, more in sorrow than in
anger at my utter failure, "you, nix varm, nix sveat.; nutting," and
be consequently comes with towels rather before his time, having
decided upon giving me up as a bad job. He shakes his head dejec-
tedly, as he goes through the mere formality of wrapping me up, and
rubbing me down, to preserve me from sudden chill, and soon leaves me
as unworthy of further attention, probably to report my extraordinary
conduct to the Andere Mann, and to praise him in fulsome language
for his exemplary bearing in and out of the vapour bath.
"Try again another day," I say to Bath-man, as I leave. But he
has no reply for me: ke is dejected. There are only two men, who. now
the season is over, come to these baths. One is myself, and the other is
Der andere Mann, and the first is, in the Bath-man's opinion, beneath
contempt as a "Dampf-shifter."
English party here, small by degrees, and beautifully less; which
Quotation also applies to the gouts, and rheumatisms, and other ills the
flesh is heir to, under DR. CASPAR'S treatment and application of
sulphur waters.
System in my case undergoes a change. Besides the vapour bath,
•where after several ineffectual attempts I never can come up to the
temperature of Der andere Mann, I am now douched.
The Douche.—The Doucheman, I mean the man who gives you the
douche, appears dressed in a sort of nightgown and nightcap. I get
out of his way at first, under the impression that he is an elderly lady,
who has mistaken her compartment m the bath. He beckons me. I
hesitate, under the above-mentioned impression, naturally. He smiles,
and beckons me again.
Happy Thought.—Not unlike Handed father's Ghost. "His custom
always of an afternoon."
Another Happy Thought in the lame line.—" Lead on. I follow." He
does lead on, and I do follow. To a cell with bath, similar to the others,
only with a large water-pipe in it, coming down the back wall, above
where your head would be if yon sat under it.
We are both silent. He shuts the door. There is something un-
pleasantly mysterious in these movements. Feel that I must be on
the defensive. (Nervous system a little out of order, or else why be
afraid of a Doucheman, who, I know, will not do me any harm? Shall
refer this to CASPAR, who will feel my pulse, which of itself is an opera-
tion that disturbs me considerably until the Doctor speaks, when I
invariably feel relieved, whatever he says.) Doucheman suddenly takes
off his bathing-gown and appears something like an acrobat who is
going to support another acrobat on a pole. I am the other acrobat.
Wish I knew the German for " acrobat." He speaks French, so I try
"Acrobar." I say, " We are two Acrobars," pleasantly. He nods
(he ia now standing in the bath, doing something with the month of
the pipe), smiles, and turns the water on to himself, just to see how
he likes it before he tries it on we.
He is satisfied with the waterworks, and again imitates the Ohost in
-Hamlet." I descend the steps. "¿peak! I'll go no farther."
He speaks ; "plus La»," he says, whereupon, after thinking for a few
seconds what he means, I take up my position one step lower. I
can imagine a very nervous man being thoroughly frightened by the
next proceeding, which is to take yon, quite unawares, by the leg.
Somehow it's the last thing any one would think of. It seems to me
that the Douchemau has no settled plan, but that after considering
the patients for a few minutes, he is suddenly seized by a—
Happy Thought—"Ttio him by the left leg" (vide poem about the
infidel Lqnglegs) and pummel his foot.
The noise of the water rushing through the pipe on to my leg pre-
vents conversation (it is Niagara in miniature), otherwise I should like
to talk to him about the art of douching, and what is his idea of the par-
ticular benefit to the subject. la a moment's pause, that is, before he
gets hold of my other leg, I collect myself for a question in French,
"Why do you do this F" It sounds piteous, 1 fancy, as if I had
added, "I never did anything unkind to you!"
He answers that it is "pour faire rouler le sang" and begins knead-
ing my instep.
Happy Thought.—A kneaded friend is a friend indeed, or, a friend
who kneads is a friend indeed.
Think it out, and put it down to SYDNEY SMITH.
Douche on my hands, arms, chest, everywhere.
Happy Thought.—All round my hat. Happier thought, on expand-
ing my chest to the full force of the water, " All round my heart."
Niagara on my back. Squirt, rush, whizz, sky-rockets of water at
me. I am catching it heavily over the shoulders.
Happy Thought.—Should like to turn round suddenly, and see if
the Doucheman is laughing. I daresay it's very good fan for him.
Sort of perpetual practical joke. Capital employment for M ILIIURD if
he ever wants a situation.
In twenty minutes it is all over.
Happy Thought.—Write a description of it all in some cheap form.
Call it " Twenty minutes with a Doucheman." Telegraph the idea to
POPGOOD AND GROOLLY. They haven't replied to my other telegram.
Fresh water is turned on up to 30° Reaumur, and I sit calmly medi-
tating on the stirring events of the last half hour in the tranquillity of
the ordinary bath, the Doucheman having resumed his nightgown and
wished me bonjour.
Happy Thought.—" Oh that a Doucheman's draught should be," &c.
Sing it myself. Stop on remembering that if Der andere Mann is in
the building, this will encourage him to begin his operatic selections.
Back in my Room at Hotel.—Never felt so well. Premonitory
symptoms of gout have come out and gone. Telegraph to POPGOOD
AND GROOLLY. Say, "Premonitory symptoms gone. How about
theory—origination r Will you P Wire back."
A QUESTION OF THE DAY.
DBAS MB. PUNCH,
EDUCATION is the Great Question of the Day. Contempo-
raneous history is a part of education. This is partly obtained by the
study of the newspapers. But, Sir, in the interests of morality, in the
interests of true civilisation, would it not be better if the full reports
of the Divorce Court could be reduced to the very minimum of in-
formation F
Publicity in such cases as come within LORD PENZANCE'S jurisdic-
tion, is, as experience teaches, no deterrent from crime, but may, too
often, suggest precedents for the avoidance of discovery.
Yours thoughtfully, ГИЕН FAMILIAS.
A GOOD LOOK-OUT FOR LODGERS.
HERE is an earthly Paradise for Lodgers—at least, so the Adver-
tiser very likely thinks :—
A PART1IENTS FURNISHED, to be Let. * * Close to Railways
-fi. and Omnibuses. Terms moderate. * • No eat.
Considering the screams and screeches they emit, proximity to rail-
ways may be questionably pleasurable. But what a world of comfort,
and what saving of one s marmalade, cigars, odd coppers, and cold
mutton is to the lodger's mind implied by those two little words—
"No Cat!"
— • •—' • — • • —
A Very Serious Plague.
EVERYBODY has his pet plague of Irish land tenure. Punch has an
idea that the great curse of landed property in Ireland is the slugs.
In other countries they destroy the green crops, in Ireland they destroy
the landlords.

COMPETITIVE CABMEN.
HT should not cabmen be
elected by public competi-

perhaps, not too civil— ser-
vants P Free trade has
failed at present to improve
them or their vehicles, as
we fondly hoped it might.
Where are the new nine-
penny-a-milers we were pro-
mised, with their drivers
dressed in livery.and handing
us a ticket with their num-
bers and their fares P We
may as well expect to find
an oyster in a cabbage as a
ticket proffered to us when
we jump into a cab. Yet
wbat, is possible in Paris

Repeal the Act of last year,

police. Refuse to license
rickety hansoms and ram-
shackle four-wheelers, such
as now for dirty night-work

OK I^^^SB Encourage conscientious-
У1' ness, civility and cleanliness
by every practicable means.
Give rewards for all the articles, especially umbrellas, which are
brought to the Lost Office when left in any cab. Dismiss all drunkards,
and extortioners, and users of foul language, upon the first well-
proved offence. Encourage competition for every vacant drivership,
and choose the right man for the place by the test of an examination
paper such as this :—
1. How long have you studied the topography of London? And to
what points of the suburbs does your knowledge now extend?
2. Describe the shortest, cut from Highbury to Houndsditch; and
state by what routes you would drive a countryman, a foreigner, and
a Lon'don lawyer's clerk; and what would be the fare demanded in
each case.
3. When you are asked to carry luggage from your cab into a house,
whereof the door is opened by a footman in plush breeches, do you or
not consider you are privileged to grumble, unless paid a shilling extra
for saving him the job?
Jt. Under what provocation do you deem yourself entitled to call a
man "no gentleman"? WoulJ you dp so for his giving you a trifle
less than double what you know is the right fare?
5. If you found left in your cab a purse of coin, an opera-glass, а
packet of sandwiches, a cigar-case, a portmanteau, an overcoat, a
pocket-book, a flask ot sherry, an olii walking-stick and a bran new silk
umbrella, which of these articles, if any, would you take to Scotland
Yard?
6. If you were hailed simultaneously by a gentleman with a small
hand-bag and a gentleman with three ladies and a quantity of luggage,
by whom would jou consider that you were first engaged P
7. Under what circumstances do you think it pays to bo insulting to
a lady?
8. With what pcr-centage of excess upon the proper legal fare do
you consider yourself satisfied, after candidly professing utter ignorance
of distance, and humbly saying to a swell that "you leaves it to his
honour"?
9. Do you consider yourself privileged to smoke inside your cab P
And if so, what excuses can you invent for doing so P
10 How much short of half a sovereign would tempt you on a wet
night from Regent Street to Hampstead?
11. Suppose a swell in Piccadilly were to tell you to drive him to
Whitechapel, in how many miles and hours would yon reach your
destination P What amount of fare would your honesty of conscience
permit you to demand? And, in case of a dispute, what vehemence of
language could you adduce to back your statement that "the streets
is most all hup, and so we "ad to come a bit. sirskewertous "?
12. When hired by the hour, has your wish to give good money's-
worth ever lured you to such speed, that you have felt yourself in
danger of a fine for furious driving?
TUE REAL BRIDGEWATEK CANAL —The Voter's Breeches-Pocket.
THE QUEST OF THE HOLY POKEß.
(A Fragment overlooked by the Poet-Laureate.)
THUS ebb'd and flow'd the ocean of small talk
Between us twain, we wending, till, at length,
We neared the yawning chasm but newly bridged
By Cyclopean art, too fondly deemed
Omnipotent,; since steps of restless men
And thundering wains had rent the granite piers
That bore the mass. We passed to where the wand
Of magian deft, had smit down Middle Row
And given Holborn to the smile of DAT
And MARTIN: turned the angle of the street
Where CHATTKKTON, indignant, spurned the world;
When lo, upon our guze monastic piles
Flashed suddenly; and many a sad-robed priest
And spinster, habited in garb of eld,
Sped ever to the shrine. Awhile we stood
Musing of Time's mutations, as we marked
How strangely showed the ways of Moyen Age
Cropping above this nineteenth century.
So found I then a voice: "And dcemest thou,
Young neophyte, the object of thy search,
The Holy Poker of Mosaic fame,
Lies yonder in St. Alban's sanctuary?"
He, wondering, spread abroad his ckmk of serge,
Wrought in corrtctrst shape by Cox & Co.,
And underneath his wide-rimmed billjcock,
Showing a face all wan with pious fasts
And lengthened macerations, thus unbosomed
His ardent hopes.
"Was it not yonder priest,
The holy HBRIOT, who, in former days,

With feline immortality? Then here
We well may deem, if doomed at all to find
The relic, that success shall crown our quest."
So saying, we sought the cloister. Yet before
Its ponderous gate clashed on our entering steps,
A passing minstrel, fresh from Leather Lane,
Of garb Italian, tuned his organ-pipe
To accents of contagious melody
Sung nightly by the bards in WESTON'S Hall:
And from the circling crowd, one little voice,
Clear as the shrill pipe of an Echo-boy,
Took up the sweet refrain—Act on the Square.

"О ye who seek to find, yet, seeking, miss
The seeker's goal, and crown of all success

RECIPROCITY.
(Chorus of Neo-Prtteclionifts)
TUNE—" Country Dance."
YOUR statesmen many a speech
Have made with much verbosity,
Wherein Free Trade they preach,
But don't preach Reciprocity.
Their words may sparkle and glow,
But what good 'a luminosity,
Unless good cause to show
Why there 's no Reciprocity P
Against Free Trade we bear
No jot of animosity,
But think it isn't fair
If there 's no Reciprocity.
Our imports so exceed
Our exports, 'tis monstrosity
To talk of Commerce freed,
When there 's no Reciprocity.
And how the nation gains
We can't see, from callosity,
Perlmps you think, of brains;
But we want Reciprocity.

Such argument's all chaff,
Proceeding from jocosity.

But cry for Reciprocity.

LOOK AT THE CLOCK.
(A Hint to the Bench.)
THE Dublin Church Convention has been a characteristically
stormy one—especially on the question of the episcopal veto. The
Bishops wanted an absolute power of saying no to any proposal, lay
or clerical. This has been refused them point-blank. Then the
DEA» oí CASHEL proposed that when two-thirds of the lay and
clerical orders agreed, and the bishops opposed, the whole Convention
should vote, and might pass the measure over the bishops' heads. On
this bou!) ABBRCOHN moved an amend ment that a concurrence of seven
bishops should he necessary to give effect to the episcopal veto. There
seems to have been a sad muddle in the conduct of the voting on these
propositions. GENEIIAL DUNNE objected, first, that the amendment was
put after the hour for adjournment. Then, that several speakers were
unfairly estopped from speaking un the resolution; finally, that the
President-Primate declared the amendment carried, though a division
was called for.
The Primate, after explaining that the Church, in its present destitute
condition, "had not been able to establish a clock," threw the blame
on his watch, which he said, like many other things, was out of order.
It had lost a quarter of an hour, and when its owner thought it was
only five o'clock, it was, in Г id, a quarter past. The Primate is not
the first dignified Churchman who has trusted an untrustworthy dial,
and found himself " behind the times" in consequence, by a good deal
more than a quarter of an hour. Thanks tu disestablishment, the
Irish bishops are beginning to liml out the time of day, even without a
clock. Their brethren of the English bench still trust to the clock of
the House of Lords, and have not yet been furced by bitter experience
and hard facts to " realise" the discovery how very much tuo slow
is that antiquated time-piece.

THE CAB OF NO COLOURS.
A GOOD many cabs are now seen surmounted with the flag specifying
their fares, prescribed by the HOME SECRETARY. Not a few however,
remain unprovided with any such ensign. Wherefore? Not neces-
sarily from mere contumacy on the part of the cabman or his employer.
In general, probably, because Cabby, having no idea of any definite
mileage, or charge per hour in his mind, feels really unable to hoist
any standard of terms. He means to leaveLis payment to spontaneous
munificence, or to parsimony exalted into munificence by grumbling
and sarcasm. How to tabulate this proposal of fares he does not kuow.
Therefore he cannot tell what flag to order. Let a proper oue he
provided for him, to hand. It must display no figures, only an in-
scription. His flag should be charged with the legend, "Leave it to
you, Sir." That is the banner which the now baimerless Cabby would
like to drive under.

A PUZZLE FROM PARIS.
UR intelligence is puzzled to
make out this fashionable
morsel of intelligence :—
"Imngine a skirt of groseille
faille ornamented on the front
breadth en tablier, with a band
of old Bruges guipure, framed
aa it were with a double bouil-
lonné of velvet, of the shade
called prune de Monsieur.* *
Bodice with a point in front and
a basque at the back, made of
prune de Monsieur faille, cut
low and square in front, and
trimmed with a band of Bruges
guipure arranged as braces.'
By the aid of a French
dictionary, we learn that
"groseille means a goose-
berry, and "faille " a fault,
orexcavation ; that " tablier"
means a chessboard, and
"bouillonné" a bubbling.
But this knowledge only
serves still more to puzzle
and perplex us, and confuse
the picture which our strong
imagination is challenged to
conceive. We also find that
"prune de Monsieur" simply
means an Orleans plum ; and
we may admit that the colour of this fruit, is certainly a plummy colour
for a dress. But how can we imagine a lady wearing articles so mas-
culine as "braces," unless, indeed, she does so in a figurative manner,
with certain other clothing, which indicates the grey mare to be the
better horse?
FREE AND EASY VERSIONS OF THE CLASSICS.
IT is not only at Rome, it appears, that Latin is at a discount. The
advice given by Punch some weeks since, in reference to the prelates
assembled at the (Ecumenical Council, "Look up your Latin, may be
auplied nearer home. MR. BELLEW'S librettist, who has interpolated
the Hymn of St. Ambrose into tiamle.t, thus freely, not to say wildly,
translates Gallas arguit canentes: "The cock scolds those lying in
bed!" On the dissected "crib" principle so popular with small
schoolboys, we presume the words would run thus: Oallus, the cock,
arguit, scolds, canentes, those lying in bed. This reminds one very
forcibly of the student's rendering of oíuoi л-ел-Лтггл«', m the Agamrm-
non of jEscHYLUS: "O dear, I'm blowed!" Punch is templed to
append a few " tentative renderings" on this free and easy principle:
1. Arma virumque caao. A classical expression of the adage "Spare
the rod, and spoil the child." Translation: Arma, our arms, virumque,
and our strength, (are) cano, in the cane.
2. Ne sutor ultra crepidam. "Always be off with the old love belore
you are on with the new." Literal translation: Ne, let not, sutor, the
suitor, (go) ultra, beyond, crepidam, the last.
3 Dulce et decorum est pro patria morí. HORACE s tribute to his
Papa's worth. A beautiful sentiment. Translation : Mori, the charac-
ter, pro patria, of my father, est, was, dulce et decorum, sweet and
gentlemanly.
4. Pérsicos odi, puer, apparatus. Scientific. Apparatus, an appa-
ratus, pérsicos, for dispersing, puer odi, the pure Od force.
5. Stat magni nomiiiis umbra. The explanation of a very common
loss. Translation: Nomini,'! umbra, no man's umbrella, slut maguí,
stands for much (i. e. is worth much).
6. Judex damnatur cum norensabsolvilnr. Applicable to the Clerken-
well Court. Translation: Judex, the Judge, damnatur, uses strong
language, cum, when, ttocens, no sense, absolvilur, is talked by counsel.
Should MR. BELLEW propose introducing "Ritual Music " into his
next reading of John Qilpin, or BARHAM'S Babes in the Wood, Mr.
Punch will be happy to do the translations for the libretto.
A FINE HBA.D OF HUMBUG.
WHEW will it become impossible for a respectable newspaper to
publish the advertisement of a parcel of fibs such as that which we
proceed to quote? It has been appearing for nearly the last two
months :—
BEAUTIFUL HAIR FOR 1870.—Renew your Youth with the New
Year. Get at once a bottle of 's WOULD s HAIK КЕЯТОВЕН.
See how surely and quickly it does its work."
Paralysis? No, let us hope. But yes, if it contains lead. Pour
into a small wineglassful of the " World's Hair Restorer" a few drops
of solution of iodide of potassium in water. If the mixture turns deep
yellow, the "World's Hair Restorer" does contain lead. But the
work which you are invited to see how surely and quickly il does is
that stated as follows :—
"Grey hair rettorcd (not dyed) to its original colour, gloss, and beauty,
the thin hair thickened and new growth promoted."
Any application whatsoever which changes the colour of grey Lair
surely and quickly must be a dye.
It must he a dye,
That stuff that you buy,
Like a fool that you are for believing a lie.
The remainder of this puff of the "World's Hair Restorer" may be
said to contain a certain amount of statement which, 1o be sure, is not
the reverse of fact :—
"No pomade or oil is required with it."
That may be. But as to the assertion that :—
"It is sure, safe, and reliable."
Its sureness, simpletons may need to be told, can depend only on its
chemical act.ion, which makes it iuevilaUy stein the hair; if it is sure, it
is surely a dye. Its safety depends on the questionable point, whether it
contains lead or any other poison; say mercury—calomel for instance.
Try it for calomel. Shake a little of it up with an equal quantity of
lime-water, and see if it turns black.
"Reliable" the " World's Hair Restorer" may be, equally with the
great majority of allegations to which that American vulgarism is
commonly applied.
As to the assurance that :—
"No one can be disappointed with its effect, and with the New Tear yonth
and beauty can be renewed."
—it is only necessary to say that the "World's Hair Restorer" is not
advertised by anybody who professes to carry on the business of
MADAME RACHEL, pending her incarceration under sentence of penal
servitude, and, as her representative, to continue making hags "beau-
tiful for ever.
Thus much is true, and more than true enough, as to the World's
Hair Restorer.
"Sold by chemists and perfumers only in large bottles, 6s."
It is too true that the "World's Hair Restorer" is sold; that there
are people, and perhaps a good many, who are fools enough to buy it
at 6«. a bottle. Let any one who has bought it get it anabsed, and
see if it is worth as many pence. Fiat experimcntum in cofpore titi.
This stuff, however, selling at 0*. a bottle, non. vili venit.
The site of the "Depot" where the " World's Hair Restorer" is
sold, is one point more in which the advertisement of it can be believed,
concluding in a piece of information which we need not proclaim.
Justice for Ireland.
PEOPLE have been disputing the truth of that famous saying of
DAVIES, KING JAMIE'S Attorney-General (lately quoted by MR.
GLADSTONE), " that no nation so loved indifferent justice as the Irish."
It is quite true. What justice can be so indifferent as "the wild
justice of revenge "?
BOUNDING ON THE STAGE.
Galignuni says that MADAME GANDON, "who seems to be a bright
particular star of the St. Petersburg Opera, has got into a scrape for
being too demonstrative in her dancing. She has been regularly tried"
for that misbehaviour, "and the Court fined her eighty roubles for
gestures out of all bounds." Bounds, such as those of a fawn or a
kangaroo, certainly ought to be the limits of chorégraphie display.
Our own British sylphs of the ballet, as fashionable society is well
aware, are accustomed to confine their feats of agility and grace to
pirouettes, capers, and steps of which none exceed the bounds of
elegance.
Worth Knowing.
PERHAPS it is not generally known that one of the greatest improve-
ments in photographic portraiture can be traced back to the celebrated
French philosopher—DES CARTES.

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
OUR table d'hôte party is very select. There are two gentlemen in a
state of progressive convalescence, who compare notes as to health across
the table. A nervous person, who eats preserved peas with a knife,
and has a jerky way, like an automaton-diner, with his fork and a bit
of bread when eating fish. There are two Naval gentlemen, one a
Commander and the olher a Lieutenant. The Commander has been
all over the world, and has a great story about a Mongoose. No one
has heard the eud of it, as he generally forgets a date or somebody's
name essential to the denouement of the Mongoose. Always thought
till now that a Mongoose was humbug, like the Phoenix. The Lieu-
tenant contradicts the Commander on most naval matters, but has
never seen a Mongof SR. There is a charming cld gentleman who has
translated jEsciiYLDs mid EURÍPIDES into English verse: he has been
complimented by I lie greatest scholars of the day, and his publishers
have just sent him in his bill for printing, and a letter to know what,
the deuce they shall do with the first thousand. We talk together about
Greek poets.
Happy Thought.—Take up Greek again. Bead HOMER. Old gentle-
man quotes passages. Uf course I remember, he says to me, the passage
in the Iliad commencing "Díñamelo»potly," &c. Of course 1 dont.
Happy Thouflhi.—To encourage him, say, as if cogitating, "Yes,"
dubiously, " I fancy I recollect the gist of the passage." " Ah!" he re-
plies, "and what would you make of the epithet there: an epithet used
only once, as I believe, in that sense by HÇMER, or any later Greek
poet?" I can make nothing of it, and leave it to him. What does he
make of it? "That," he returns, "hae always been his difficulty."
Don't like to ask what epithet he means.
Happy Thought.—To quote carelessly "Poluphnisboio Thalasses" and
say with enthusiasm, "Ah, there 's an epithet! How grand and full is
the Greek language!" Luckily at this moment the Commander atks
ine if 1 've heard what he was telling the Doctor about the Mongoose,
and the waiter hands the saucr-kraut (excellent dish ! !) to the trans-
lator of .JiaCHYLUS.
When we sit late and have Champagne, as is the case on Sundays or
on the departure of a friend or a birthday, we all get into philosophical
discussion, all except the Commander and the Lieutenant, who nearly
come to high words (invariably) on points of seamanship, as to whether
it и better or not, in a storm, to rig the boom taffrail, or pay ont the
gaff. The Commander appeals to our common sense in behalf of the
boom taffrail, and the Lieutenant observes scornfully, that " Any one
who knows how to sail a vessel would immediately pay out the gaff."
Happy Thought.—fo say, conciliatingly, "Well, I suppose it doesn't
much matter."
They retort, "Oh, doesn't it!" and explain. More Champagne.
The Commander afterwards takes me aside and depreciates the Lieu-
tenant's theories in confidence. The Lieutenant takes DYSGWELL
apart, and says he should be very sorry to be sailing under his (the
Commander's! orders. DYNGWELL observes, "That both the nautical
Cockalorums have been going on the scoop, and are slightly moppy."
By which we understand him to mean, that the two naval officers have
had as much as is bad for them.
Happy Thought.—A naval officer half-seas over. (Think this out, and
put it down to SYDNEY SMITH.)
First Day of Fourth Week at Aix.—\ am quite well. Three more
douches, two vapours, and four ordinary baths will settle the question.
Happy Thought.—Present DR. CASPAR with a testimonial; say
the first volume of Typical Developmentt, when it appears, with plates.
"Anatomy" (under A) will interest him.
Letter from FUIDIIY. I must come back, she says
Happy Thought.—Nice to be written to affectionately.
1 turn over the page: she continues, "—or ¡end a cheque." Itappears
I've stayed away longer than she expected. The baby is less rashv
than he was. Kegret that I must go home before I've got on with
my German.
A German. Lesson.—My Professor of languages is the most amiable,
patient, and persevering gentleman. He is much tried by CAPTAIN
DYNGWELL, to whom he has been for some time giving lessons.
DYNGWTSLL invariably salutes him—he is Doctor-of-Law or some
degree or other, and a man with whom anyone of a philosophic turn
would at once commence discussing German metaphysics or deep and
interesting psychological questions; but DYNGWELL invariably salutes
him with a slap on. the back, a hearty slap on the back, or with a pre-
tended lunge of his walking-stick into the professor's fifth rib, making
him wince but smile, and addressing him as, " Hullo ! old Cockalorum!
Sprechen-Sie Deutsch?"
At first I ascertain the Professor went home and looked out
"Cockalorum" in the dictionary—he is a great man for roots and
derivations, and knows BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER, MASSINGER,
SHAKSPEABE, and most old standard authors by heart. Not finding
Cockalorum in any known glossary, he gets near it as a probable
genitive plural of Cock-a-leekie, aud humbly sets this down to his
ignorance of Scotch dialects. Later on, he determines, after a night's
deep thought, that it is a corruption of Gustos Rotulorum, and announces
this as an interesting philological discovery to DYNGWELL, who re-
ceives the information with his glass in his eye and the remark, that it 's
"Whatever you please, my little dear, only blow your nose and don't
breathe upon the glasses. To which he gives an air of authority, verv
confusing to the Professor, by adding, "hem! SHAKSPEABE," which
causes the good Herr another sleepless night in hie library.
Happy Thought..—Explain DYNGWELL to him.
We have an interesting discussion on ancient and modern slang.
To assist me in reading German, the Professor kindly takes me to his
Club; an excellent social club with a reading-room full of newspapers,
German, French, and English.
1 take up the something Zeitung, and am helpless. End by reading
the Times.
Commence German Lesson. Head and translate out of German into
English, and back again. The principal characters in the exercise are
the shoemaker and the tailor, and, of course, my father and my mother.
DYNGWELL is satisfied with this sort of thing, and copies out reams of
examples.
Happy Thovght.—Make my own examples and gradually compile a
new exercise book. My Professor is pleased with the idea as original.
I make selections on paper, modelling them on AHN'S La Langue
Allemande.
Examples for the Use of Students (might include these in Typ. Devel.)
—The shoemaker is sad. The father of the shoemaker is fat. The wife
of the gardener has given an umbrella to the shoenmker. The mother
of the carpenter was often in my garden. Will you fight the gardener?
No, HENRY will fight the gardener, because the shoemaker is ill (krank).
Here is FERDINAND! Have you washed your boots P Yes, my mother,
I have also washed the boots of the gardener.
For more Advanced Students.—At what hour do you sup? I sup at
nine o'clock with the wife of the shoemaker. Have you seen my
brother? No: but I have written to my uncle and my aunt. Will
you eat some ham P No: I will not eat some ham. The lion is ill.
The shoemaker laughs at the gardener's aunt (i'e., the aunt of the
gardener). Your cousin was looking for his hat while the merchant
was dancing. The hound is not so fat as the cat (als die Katze).
I dance better than you, but you do your exercises better than I.
Your father was playing in the garden with your uncle when the lion
came. The industrious schoolboy is loved by everybody. My neighbour
has sold his chickens to the lion. The coachman is eating plums and
apples, and we have wine and beer. Give me some soup, some wine,
some beer, some sugar, some vegetables, and some ink, and do not call
me till four in the morning. The tailor is here, so is the shoemaker,
but the lion has eaten the gardener.
Happy Thought,— (Finishing sentence to the exercise ) The big lion
has eaten the tailor, the shoemaker, the gardener, their aunts and
uncles, the brothers and neighbours, and also the ink, the sugar, the
tea, the cream, the ham, the plums, and the boots.
Happy Thought.—To astonish FRIDDY with a letter in Germai'.
Write home and say, "Meine liebe trau, I am not krank now, but very
much besser; in fact, quite well. Hast du wein cheqiie-burh gefunden'?
Ich habe nein bad genommen. Ich habe mein cheque-buch nicht. Bist
du krank?"
Capital exercise the above.
DR. CASPAR compliments me on being thinner. I feel pleased.
Note that generativ every one is pleased at being thinner.
Go and get weighed at Miss HELENTHALER'S tobacconist shop.
Every one gets weighed here. Wonderful how Miss CATHEBINE, who
keeps the shop, speaks English perfectly without ever having been in
England. Wonder if I should ever speak German without going to
Germany, or even with going to Germany.
Note.—A writer in the Daily Telegraph, whose article I see here,
describes two gardens as existing at Aix. One, he says called after the
faithless spouse of MENKLAUS. There is no such place. There is tho
Elisa Garden, and there is Miss //ete^iuALER (i.e. Miss САТПЕШКК),
who is much amused at being called a garden.
Happy Thought.—Write to Daily T. and correct mistake.
Happy Thought.—Leave it alone.
I shall be sorry to leave. The longer one stays in Aachen, the more
you learn of the people, the pleasanter it is.
But POPGOOD AND GiujoLLY call ; or rather, as they haven't answered
my telegrams, 1 really must go and see what's the matter.
Happy Thought.—Return home by Paris. Ask FRIDDY to meet me
there with her mother. On thinking this out (nothing like thinking a
thing out), decide that it 's better (besser) not to ask her. Shall like a
few days holiday in Paris.
Happy Tlurught.—Celebrate my convalescence by a dinner given to
the Proi'cssor, CASPAR, and DYNGWELL.
THE BEST B,EcoMifENDiTioN OP THE IRISH LAND BILL.—The
clamour of the National Press against it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE IRREPRESSIBLE SUNDAY BILL
no can see any
reason why Lottn
С HELMSFOKI)
should have been
so superfluous as
to trouhl« the
House of Lords
to discuss a Sun-
dayTrading Bill?
A gentleman
named AYRES,
on his legs the
other day, at a
meeting neld in
Whitechapel, by
a number of
s ho pk eepers,
hawkers, and
other dealers, whose interests are threatened by that project of Sabba-
tarian legislation, very justly remarked, touching the promoters of
l interference with the liberty and enjoyments of the working classes on
Sunday, that :—
"They did not dare to attack the railway interest, because the railway
companies possessed ninety votes, but the small tradesmen had not a single
member to represent them directly."
It would be worse than quoting an old Joe Miller to remind LORD
CHÏLMSFORD that people cannot be made religious by Act of Parlia-
ment. Of course he knows that; and has no idea of making them.
He simply wants to prevent the poorer inhabitants of Whitechapel
from hurting his own and other gentlefolk's feelings of decorum touch-
ing Sunday observance. But, without perpetrating a platitude, it
may be suggested to the noble and learned lord, that it is very possible
to make people irreligious by Act of Parliament; and that an Act
which imposes restrictions on their liberty iu respect of Sunday, whilst
it allows the richer classes to drive about in carriages, luxuriate in
clnbs, and practically do just whatever they please, is about the best
statute that could be devised for that purpose.
A CAPITAL INVESTMENT.
"WHAT shall I do with my money P" is a question which may
puzzle those who have more wealth than wit. Such people should be
thankful for being shown the way of spending money usefully,—as, for
instance, by subscribing to such charities as thU :—
"The Parochial Misiion Women's Association пал, for a charitable under-
taking, this most unusual merit,—that it gives nothing away in charity. IU
avowed object is to hrlp the poor only by teaching them to help themselves.
The duty of the mission woman is to go about among the poor ... for the
purpose of persuading them to exercise a little forethought, and save a por-
tion, no matter how slight, of their doily or weekly earnings, until they have
got enough together to purchase some useful article."
People with more money than they know how to spend may here
find for their spare capital a capital investment. Such missionaries as
these, who help the poor by teaching them how they may help them-
selves, assuredly well merit to be helped in their good work.
"It is in fact a sort of savings'-bank, co-operative store, conversation
class, school and church, all rolled into one, with the additional advantage
that these institutions are brought, as it were, to the doors of the poor, since
the poor «ill not go to them."
These mission-women, mind you, are poor persons themselves, and
are thoroughly acquainted with the ways and means of those among
whom they are sent. The advice which they can offer, and the helping
hand which backs it, are given in a kindly way, and never interfering,
and have the weight which years, experience, and sympathy, can add.
Selttielp is the chief lesson that needs teaching to our poor; and the
teachers here employed are the best that can be chosen, aiid the
likeliest to be listened to by those who need to be taught.
The Heat of Debate.
Тн E Bouse of Commons should be careful of entering into discussions
about foot-warmers in railway carriages, lest, after going on so far in
the Session pretty comfortably, they get into not water
FROM COLWELL HATCHNEY.
DURING the coldest weather this winter, the Collegians of Colwell
Hatchney ran races. The united Heats amounted to 227° above the
level of tne thermometer.
A Professional View of Things.
WHEN our Schoolmaster, who is fond of pedestrian exercise, sets
out for a walk of several miles, he always says that he is going for a
good long Spell in the Country.
corse AHEAD!
BULLS are» not generally considered intelligent creatures, bnt in
America they are trained to such perfection that they can Toss a Pan-
cake on Shrove Tuesday.
I» THE LADIES' GALLEBT.—MBS. MALAPEOP is unable to under-
stand why in the House of Commons they talk of their Eyes and their
Nose. She says she was brought up to say Noses.
ON THE WRONG GROUND.
IF tiie hand-work ing men who aspire to Parliamentary representation
of their class wish to retain the sympathy and support of the head-
working men in their struggle, they should be very careful in their
choice of fighting-ground, Fight where they will, they will have a
hard tussle; but they may double or halve their strength as they
choose their ground well or ill. At Maidbtone they chose it as badly
as possible. What room was there for a working man's candidate in a
contest where the Liberal champion was SIR JOHN LrjuuocK, whose
claims to Liber»! support are not a whit overstated in the Spe.fla.tor'г
descrip'iou of him, as, at once, "an able banker, an accomplished
economist and financier, a man of the widest and deepest scientific
culture, и thorough physiologist, a good geologist, an original writer
on pre-historic times—one who combines practical and intellectual
power rarely united in one man P" Surely members of this calibre are
at least as rare in the House of Commons, and should be as precious
there, as the most horny-banded and hard-headed of working men. It
is true that MR. APPLEGARTH, the working man's candidate, retired
before the final struggle, finding—according to his own statement—
"that he was too late in the field to make headway against the popular
feeUng in SIR JOHN LUBBOCK'S favour!" He had better have said,
i "finding that he had no business ever to have come forward." What
right, Punch asks him, had he, or any man who wishes to see the best
wisdom of England in the House of Commons, in the field which
SIR JOHN LUBBOCK had occupied in advance of him? All working
men, who are worth their salt, must admit that no claims that could
be set up on behalf of their order could stand a moment's comparison
with those of SIR JOHN LUJSBOCK on the support of the best and
broadest Liberalism. Let them choose constituencies where they will
have to fight pseudo-Liberalism and genuine Toryism, and welcome.
But in the name of their cause and ours, don't let them put stumbling
blocks in the Parliamentary path of such men as SIR JOHN LUBBOCK,
or they will only do what they have more than once done already—
make way for the fox, while the lion and the bear are worrying each
other.

of whom we ears so much. Speaking as a phootman I can say as pur
Young Missuses deserve to be exibited, for they continally are making
exibitions of theirselves. I'm shaw if the Akedemy was to show em
up in their true colours, which I don't mean there dyed air, the Exibi-
tion would be found igstreemly poplar with the public, & aviuk the sup-
port of all we suvnts, who in course would phfock to see it, you may
take your Alfred Davy it would be a great pecoonary suxe«s. Apollo
Gyesing for the libaty of begging you to publish my Hidea, i remane
yours most obedient to command JOHN THOMAS
P.S. I ear that some of our old Masters is now pretty nearly beauties
without Paint. Well you can't say that exackly oí some of our Old &
Young Missuses.
Restless Robert.
No keeping that boy BOB quiet!
First, ne made us pay all our assessed taxes in January, and so did
the tax-payer out of five quarters' tax in a year, pocketing by the
dodge three millions in advance. Now, he insis's on the Bank's
paying dividends quarterly, and so makes the fundholder a present of
a quarter's interest, or something very like two millions in all.
Does he mean us to set the douceur against the do?
Unluckily, we all pay taxes, but we don't all draw dividends.

IT is generally understood that if the Bill which has been introduced into the

A Bill to oblige "Railway Companies to have the Doors of their Carriages
closed quietly nnd gently, and not slammed with the Noise and Violence now
annoyingly customary.
A Bill to compel Omnibus Passengers to pay their Fare before they leave the
Conveyance, or at least, to be ready to tender it when they alight; and not to
detain the Vehicle while they feel in all their Pockets for their Purses, or request
change for Half-a-Sovereign.
A Bill to restrain youug Persons under Twelve from driving their Hoops along

think so too. Well; no doubt but what compensation for killed and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A RITUALIST REDOUBT.
ACCORDING to the John Bull"an ordinary meeting" of the English
Church Union took place the other day at the Freemasons' Ta*em.
The lodge, however, of the English Church Unionists, was not tiled;
for the John Bull reports their proceedings, and the speeches made by
some of them, with reference to the late ritual judgments in the Court
of Arches. Notwithstanding these, in moving a resolution—
"The REV. SIR H. BAKES . . . said that ... he had not j-et given up
altar-lights. . . He regretted exceedingly the decieion as to the north aide
of the altar."
The north side of the altar appears to be a position of great impor-
tance to the Ritualist Division. Though pronounced untenable, it
has not been evacuated. Another reverend speaker, the REV. R. T.
WEST, observed that—
"He should like to see the position of the priest at the altar tried again,
and he certainly should not give up the north eide at present. . . He thought
the Union would be prepared to try the question of the north aide again, but
nobody had RPV faith in the integrity of the Judicial Committee, and their
judgment would not be regarded as binding by anybody."
So MR. WEST still holds the north side of the altar. B-it, how this
pnbt is to be defended, the occupants of it have hardly determined.
Would a Moncrif ff Battery answer their purpose? Or would an iron-
clad stationed north of the side of the fortress attacked be more appro-
priate? Perhaps; for MR. WEST spoke rather as a sailor than a
soldier of the Church Militant, in saying :—
"He was almost determined to adopt the altar-lights again, but should
not do anything without consulting his brethren; for he believed in 'a long
pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together.'"
This may, indeed, be supposed to be an article in every seaman's
belief, although there is no such clause contained in any other creed.
It is, however, at any rate clear that these Church Unionists mean
fighting :—
"The EEV. C. J. LE GBTT was glad that no immediate action woe in-
tended."
This declaration is warlike, if Fabian. They do contemplate going
into action then, by-and-by. With what enemy? Apparently the
body named by MR. WEST, when he said :—
"It was greatly to be regretted that MR. Риксплз had dragged them
through the mire as he had done; for he thought that if they had been quiet
nnd unobtrusive in their services, they would never have been troubled by the
Church Association."
Hence it seems that the Church Association is the foe by whom the
north side of the altar is threatened—thanks to the too loudly demon-
strative proceedings of MR. PURCIUS. The Church Union would not
have brought the Church Association down upon themselves " if they
had been quiet and unobtrusive in their services." There is, doubtless,
some sense in that observation, and not a little in another :—
"MR. DONALDSON personally thought that the north side was one of their
weakest pointe."
It is not perhaps too much to say, that these two remarks comprise
everything sensible which was uttered by the united Ritualists at the
Freemasons' Tavern. The north side of the alter is doubtless one of the
weakest of t.hn many weak points held by the Ritualists. Their enemies
will be all delighted to see them waste their time and labour in the
endeavour to strengthen it. Whilst they are busily and bravely engaged
in trying to maintain the north side of the altar, they may have the
whole Church knocked about their ears. A Church, comprising a
Church Union and a Church Association at war with each other, can-
not be seriously said to be very unlike a house divided against itself.
In the meantime Papists and Dissenters smiling, remark that there is
nothing like Unity in the Church.
POOD FOR FAITH.
FROM a contemporary's Own Correspondent we learn that, at the
Roman Council :—
"The assemblies of the 10th and 14th were devoted to the modification of
the catechism—' Бе novo et unijormi Catichismo cdetido.'"
Du. GUMMING is respectfully informed that the Council intends this
Catechism to be published, not to be eaten, except in so far aa its
contents are meant to be metaphorically swallowed by those who will
have to digest them as best they may. It may be possible, however,
hut ia hardly prohnbl«, that the Council, about to edit a new Catechism,
will eat somb uf their hard words contained in the old one.
EAILWAY LIMB INSUBANCE.
IT is to be hoped that the necessity of united action, according I o
the maxim that when rogues combine honest men should unite—tu
defeat their schemes—will be suggested by the following extract from
the Observer:—
"We are informed that a strong combination has been formed among the
Directors of some of the leading Railway Companies for the purpose of intro-
ducing a Bill into Parliament in the present session on the subject of compen-
sation for accidents. It is proposed to limit the sum to he paid in cásea of loss
or personal injury, but to give to passengers the right of insuring with the
companies for larger amounts for a moderate premium."
The rates of compensation for death or injury sustained from railway
accidents are high. But what can that signify if no accidents occur?
The expense of taking care they shall not. That we are afraid, is what
the Directors, who want Parliament to limit liability for the conse-
quences of those accidents, object to.
As to Railway Insurance, no men would insure their lives with the
Railway Companies except fathers of families, caring about their wives
and families uncommonly. None but an extremely small few of the
very strongest-minded women would insure at all. No one, having not
nny survivors to care for, would insure his life, unless he were an
Inshman; he would only insure his limbs and living body. But every
prudent person would insure those. Railway Insurance would, there-
fore, require a tariff of premiums, for which, at corresponding charges,
the constitution in general, or each member or organ of the body could
be insured. This would have to be posted at every station, conspi-
cuously, in large letters, such that they who run may read; an arm so
much, a hand so mucb, a finger so much, a leg, a foot, a toe, so much,
an ear, a nose, so mucb, and upwards. The list ought to include the
brain, to be insured against injury causing impaired intellect. Every
carriage also should contain a table of the terms of insurance in case of
death and all possible mutilations, which, if it made frivolous passengers
melancholy, would render a railway journey comparatively jolly for the
thinking traveller.
LEARNING FOR LADIES.
HERE is an interesting morsel of intelligence. We learn it from our
fashionable teacher, the Court Circular :—
"M. J. PEYRITSCH has read before the Academy of Vienna a paper 'On
the Morphology of the Umbelliferœ.'"
We wonder what are the ideas conveyed by these fine words to the
minds of the fair readers of our fashionable contemporary. Indeed,
how much the wiser will most young ladies be, even if we strive to help
them to some knowledge of the matter, by digging up the Greek and
Latin roots of these fine words? Will Miss SMITH or Miss TOMKINS
condescend to avow herself enlightened, if we tell her that "morpho-
logy" is derived from two Greek words, the one morphe, meaning
"form " or " figure," the other logos, meaning " word" or "speech;
and that the word " umbelliferte " is compounded of two Latin words,
umbella, shadeor parasol, and fero, I bear or carry? We fear such
explanation will but serve still more to puzzle those young ladies, and
lead them to imagine that the erudite professor has been delivering a
lecture on the figures of speech, or slang, say, of themselves and other
ladies, who, being umbelliferte, all carry parasols.
EPITAPH ON A FENIAN MARTYR.
SISTE, Viator:
Here lies a Traitor.
A SABBATARIAN SAGE.
THE Honorary Secretary of the Licence Amendment League is a
sagacious reasoner. Speaking for a deputation of vexatious busybodies,
who waited on the HOME SECRETARY the other day, boring him with
solicitation to impose still greater restraint than the Government
intends on the liquor trade, this philosopher pressed on MR. BKÜCR
the remarkable argument that, as picture-galleries and other places o!'
elevating recreation are closed upon Sunday, public-houses should be
closed also. This is just reversing the logic of our old position that,
whilst gin-shops and pot-houses are open on Sundays, picture-galleries
and museums ought not to be closed. The Honorary Secretary of the
Licence Amendment League has taken up a cudgel the same as ours,
and turned it against us, only he has got hold of the wrong end of the
stick.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEW CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE.

HOMSON'S Seasons
were not composed
at the periods and
under the circum-
stances which
might have been
expected to pro-
duce them. Spriiiff
was written in fur-
nished lodgings, in
the Poultry, dur-
ing the poet's re-
covery from an
attack of chicken-
pox, brought on
by the fauure of
the Cochin China
expedition under
DRAKE. Summer he
completed whilst
snowed up in a little restaurant amongst tbe Grampians, in the extraordinarily
severe winter of 1727, when several couples of fowls were roasted whole on the
Thames. Autumn, jotted down on tbe backs of old tavern bills, occupied him the
summer he was cricketing with GEORGE SELWYN on Salisbury Plain; and Winter,
we know, from documents in the State Paper Office, he dictated to his amanuensis,
CHARLES SURFACE, as they lay lounging, and drinking syllabub with Вивв DOD-
INGTON in the hay-fields near Burslem.
The MS. WARBÜRTON took one windy night under his cassock to DODSLEY,
in Pall Mall, who bought it for what we should think a very small sum; large
enough, however, to enable THOMSON to accomplish the object he had all along
had m view in writing the poem—the purchase of new stair carpets for his villa
at Richmond, where, to this day, they preserve and show (for a small gratuity) ¡
some of the stones of the peaches he was so fond of eating in his flowered dressing-
gown.
GRAY and HORACE WALFOLE went abroad together excellent friends, but soon
quarrelled, and shouted so loud amongst the Apennines that all the neighbours
heard them. The cause of their disagreement has never been satisfactorily ascer-
tained, but according to MALONE, CUMBERLAND told BISHOP PERCY that MASON
told him that GRAY'S black servant, when he thought he was dying, solemnly
declared that WALPCLE offended his master by persisting in playing the flute,
almost unceasingly, in the chaise on the journey.
The origin of the coolness which sprang uç between STEELE and ADDISON was
almost as trivial. ADDISON, liberal and munificent as he could show himself to be,
had his small economies. STEELE, haying occasion to send a letter to his wife to
tell her that he should not be home till late, having unexpectedly been called on
to take the chair at a meeting of the Philanthropic Society, at the Thatched House
Tavern, borrowed fourpence of ADDISON for the postage. STEELE repaid the
temporary advance as soon as he was able, but, unluckily, one of the coins tendered
iii discharge of the obligation proved to be French instead of English. ADDISON
discovered his loss when he had to remunerate the link-boy who lighted him
home that night from DICK'S; but STEELE was either unconscious of the unfor-
tunate mistake he had made, or thought it too insignificant to rectify, and the
breach was never healed.
Those two great naturalists, BUFÍON and CUVIER. although professors in the
same university, living in the same street, and employing the same laundress,
ceased to speak to each other for sixteen years and a half, after having Ъееп
on terms of the closest intimacy, in consequence of a difference that arose between
them at a social tea-party as to the average width of the stripes on the male
Zebra. An eighth of an inch made a gulf oetween these two friends for ever.
From what humble beginnings have some of the greatest names in our annals
climbed to fame and fortune! Little did FRANCIS BARON think when he was
bird "tenting" at a penny a-day in the pleasant fields of Marylebone, and eating
the frugal dinner which 'his careful mother had wrapped up for him in a blue
checked handkerchief, that he should one day become Lord High Admiral of
England, a Peer of the realm, and the author of that great work on the Organ, then
newly introduced into this country from Nova Scotia, which has made his name
immortal.
SHAKESPEARE, the merry black-eyed pastrycook's boy, carrying the tarts on his
head to the Stratford bakehouse; BLACKSTONE serving the bricklayers in Chancery
Lane and reading COKE by stealth; REYNOLDS taking down the shutters and
sprinkling the floor of the haberdasher's shop (doing even that in an artistic
fashion) at Newcastle-under-Lyme; MRS. INCHBALD, as a domestic servant,
cleaning the door-step in Little Britain; JOHN LOCKE, the alert, obliging ostler
at the Elephant and Castle; SAMUEL RICHARDSON, with his cheery face and
welcome muffin bell, in the dimly lighted City streets on a dark November after-
noon—these and a thousand more such illustrious examples, what admirable
subjects do they furnish for the painter, how forcibly dp they illustrate the
truth of CICERO'S noble sentiment (Pro Cánsale Planeo, xviii., 7, ed. Trombonius),
"Non insignißcantia, non impecuniosilas, non o/acuri parentes ooslant ingenio, ñeque
abililaies distinguiosissimas exüngvere passant."
SELLING THE ANCHOES!
(By an andent True-Blue.")
You boast your business-habit?,
At dock-yard muddlers thunder,
But; here 's HAY down on BAXTER
For a colossal blunder:
Here 's your out-and-out Controller,
Whom M forms and checks environ,
Selling twelve score service-anchors
For the value of old iron—
And if MESSRS. SIIAND AND THOMPSON
Had not behaved like bricks,
They 'd have sacked, per ton, the diff 'rcnce
Between forty pounds and six!
And to replace the damage
At Bon LOWE, the National Banker's,
You 'd have had to lower your balance,
Or our ships leave without Anchors!
If what you are as store-keepers
Such you are as ship-builders—
Oh, ain't you a nice BAXTER!
Ain't you a precious GUILDERS!
Nor is't i'the dockyards only,
And their administration,
That by the self-same blunder
You ve to peril put the nation.
Sine« Whiff hands trusted Radical
All old ways to unsettle,
With anchor after anchor
You've been parting, as old metal.
As SIR SPENCEE muddled "obsolete"
With " unappropriated,"
If you saw an unused anchor,
As useless it was rated;
And that First Lord was sharpest,
That Controller the most clever,
Who contrived most to get rid of,
And have broken up for ever.
Till to stay the good ship Britain
As she drifts ashore bewilders
Business men as bright as BAXTER,
And First Lords as 'cute as CHILDERS.
Once property made voters,
And with its anchor fixed 'em,
Till our DIZZY and your GLADSTONE
God rid of that betwixt 'em:
And landed qualification,
M.P.'s anchor, is got rid of:
And the House is full of jobbers,
Mere & s. d. at bid of:
Anchors of birth and breeding
Are in Ministers dispensed with:
From faith's anchor we 've freed Parsons,
E'en loose Bishops have commenced with:
Robbed of its family anchor,
All adrift is our diplomacy,
And patrician finds plebeian
In F. 0. as much at home as he.
From birch's and cat's anchor
We 've loosed services and school:
And our soldiers, tars, and schoolboys
Go to wreck for lack of rule:
And as Holland clutched her stivers
Until she lost her guilders,
So may England, with her anchors
Left to BAXTER'S care and GUILDERS.
Contented ignorance you 've lost,
Best anchor of the masses:
Stem on, into each other,
Drive swells and working classes.
From the anchor of authority
You 've cast loose press and pea;
Flung away the women's anchor,
Of submission to the men.
The anchor of obedience
Is abandoned, e'en for babbies:
From the anchor of a tariff
BRUCE has let loose the Cabbies:
From maiden-modesty's anchor,
Our fast girls are set free:

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
Arx is musical, as musical as Manchester, and much in the same
way too. Two excellent bands here; and once, a visit from Herr
Something-or-other on the fiddle of world-wide reputation, the Com-
mander informs me, though he 's the last man whom 1 should suspect
of knowing anything about it.
Happy Thought. — Has sailed round the world, and met Herr
Something with his fiddle everywhere.
DYNGWELL won't join our party to the Concert. He says, if the
Cockalorum would give us a right-fol-iddity, or a chant with a coal-
box to it" (he means chorus when he says " coalbox," and the Professor
makes a mental note of it, in order to look out this particular use of
the word coalbox in the Dictionary) "he would come ;" but as there
is no chance of his taste in this direction being gratified, he stays in
his room and runs through his German exercises.
Happy Thought.—Beer is the same in both languages. Bavarian
Beer excellent. So also the lightest wines ; e.g. Zeltinger.
Happy Thought,—Take home a cask of the former and a case of the
latter. I point out to DYNGWELL what a saving this will be, and how
necessary it is, as the father of a family (one with rashes) to be econo-
mical. He sticks his glass in his eye, and exclaims, " Bravo! quite
the drunkard !" which was not, on the whole, exactly the encomium I
had expected from him.
At the Concert.—Our party consists of the amiable and learned trans-
lator of .¿ESCHYLUS; the jovial, good-natured Yorkshire Squire (who has
got well of severe gout, in a week, in consequence of rubbing in his
draught, and drinking his lotion by mistake); the Lieutenant, who has
come to the Concert in the hopes of there being a "hop " afterwards,
which appears to be his one great aim in going to any evening enter-
tainment of any kind; the High Church Anglican clergyman, whose
resemblance to a Catholic Priest would be perfect, if there was only the
slightest chance of his being mistaken for anything else but an English
Protestent Minister; and DR. CASPAS, who knows every one and
everything in the place, and" is welcome everywhere, and can go any-
where now that Aix is deserted by strangers, and he has time for
shaking hands without feeling pulses. Our nervous compatriot does
not appear anywhere except at table d'haie, having probably jerked
himself into bed at an early hour, and shaken himself into a sound
sleep.
Happy Thought.—Perhaps I shall discover who Der Ändere Mann is.
First overture of Concert over. Room crowded. Elegant toilettes;
pretty Saxon faces ¡ Prussian officers, in uniform of course. Comman-
der has been listening in rapt attention to the music. We all listen
to a part-song critically.
Happy Thought.—To beat time with my head and hand, in order to
show that the English are a musical nation. Commander does the
same. I ask him which he prefers, ROSSINI, AUBER, or WAGNER.
He hesitates. He asks thoughtfully, "Let me see, what was ROSSINI'S
great work F"
Happy Thought.—(&j way of reply, while I think what ROSSINI has
written), "His great work! Why, ne 's written so many."
The Commander says, "He's alive still, isn't he?" I own I am
taken by surprise, never having considered the question of his being
alive: having, in fact, generally ranked him among the "Old Masters,
and got him back somewhere near SHAKSPEARE'S time.
Happy Thought.—To laugh slily and say, "I suppose so." If he
isn't, and was in SHAKSPEARE'S time, I can say I thought he (The
Commander) was joking. Mem. Read np Musical History: odd, I 'ye
quite forgotten it: under "С" (Composers) and "M (Music) in
Typ. Devel. Part III. Concert continues.
Herr Somebody on the violin.—Great applause on his appearance. He
has long hair, turn-down collar, and a pale face, at least so it seems
from this distance. Strange, now I come to think of it, that all great
violinists, whom I have ever seen, are always the same, and I always
see them from the far end of a room. He plays a melody slowly, with
which he appears pleased: so do we. Commander thinks "he must
be wonderfully strong in the chin to hold the instrument while his left
hand is jumping up and down it." People look round at Commander
and say " Sssh!" reprovingly. Herr Somebody takes three decided
scrapes at the strings, and then as it were scrambles about the violin
wildly. Three more scrapes; more scrambling: tune nowhere—one,
two, three (fiercely); twiddley-twiddley-twiddly-iddley (wildly). Down
below like a double-bass, making a sensitive person, like myself, experi-
ence a feeling not unlike that caused by the steamboat when it dives in
between two waves on a rough passage; then up again, notes running
one after the other like mice in a wall, and his four fingers and thumb
chasinff them nearly to the bridge and not catching them. Back
again, in among the screws, up the handle, on to the bndge, hand still
trying to seize on something, his eyes watching the performance
intently, and chin fixed. An occasional shifting his head a little on
one side, just for a second, as if he was ticklish, but liked the sensation.
Then a plaintive bit, which seems to make him stand on tip toes, and
causes me almost, to rise out of my seat. Then short note, still plaintive,
which brings him down on his heels again. As I watch him he seems
to become all violin and arms. Sudden appearance of a little tune,
immediately knocked on the head by the bow. Up and down the
chromatic scale, in and out the flats and sharps. Herr Somebody
loses his way in a labyrinth; more mystification; at last he 's out of
the maze; pause, flourish of bow, grand triumphal movement (no
tune to speak of, but no mistaking the time), chord« crisp, and chords
loose. Running up and down the chords ¡violin swaying as if (so to
speak) he 'd tumble off it every minute. We hold our breath in sus-
pense. I almost feel inclined to say, "Oh, do stop, Sir! take care ! for
goodness sake! take care!"
Happy Thought.—A sort of Musical Blondin. On consideration this
is a sens_ational performance.
Flourish, scuttle, scuttle, scuttle, up and down wildly, chords
hard, fast, and marked up the scale full pelt, whack! whacker!!
WHACKEST!!! and the exhausted performer is bowing his ac-
knowledgments. A sigh of relief from everyone, audibly, as if we
congratulated ourselves, and him, on getting through such a dan-
gerous performance without an accident. He is encored; but only
reappears and bows. He will not tempt Providence again. Everyone
says Admirable! Charming! Wonderful! "almost equal to JOACHIM,"
cries Du. CASPAR, enthusiastically.
Happy Thought.—"Yes, almost."
CASPAR is gone, before I can add that I "ve never heard JOACHIM. I
turn to the Commander to ask him what he, as a musical man, thinks
of it. The Commander is fast asleep.
Happy Thought.—To quote to him when he wakes, "The Rugged
Shipboy "—only I forget the rest; but the idea is that the Shipboy
sleeps tranquilly through all dangers and tempests on the top of a
mast. I have always wondered what he held on by P Will wake the
Commander, and ask him to illustrate this passage in SHAKSPEARE.
Commander wakes. On being remonstrated with for his drowsiness,
lie admits confidentially to me, as a thing not to go any further, "that
it 's not much good his being here, as he doesn't know one tune from
another."
After Concert, which is over early (another excellent thing in the
AÍT arrangements, everything is over early), we adjourn to a café,
where we each partake of a Wiener Schnitzel, some bauer-kraut, and
a tankard of such beer as won't interfere with your waking in the
morning. The Commander commences (with the cigars) his usual
story about the Mongoose. The Lieutenant begs his pardon for a
minute, and seeing a table in the ante-room vacant, proposes billiards
as a wind-up. Billiards, by all means.
We rise, and go to the billiard-room. The Commander is, I see, a
little disappointed. At this moment DYNGWBLL happens to stroll in
with his professorial friend, who joins us in much the same spirit that
DR. JOHNSON did BEAUCLBRK and the others, when they got him out
of bed for a frolic. It appears they've been to supper (one of DYNG-
WELL'S ingenious methods of doing a German exercise) at Klöppel's ([
think that 's what they call it), and thought, that he (DYNGWELL), and
Old Cockalorum (the Professor), would find us here. DYNGWELL oppor-
tunely salutes the Commander with "Hallo, old Mongoose!" which
puts an extinguisher on all chance of hearing the story from the naval
officer to-night. He has been trying to tell it for weeks. He proposes
to walk home with the Professor. Has probably hit upon the Happy
Thought of " Tell him the Mongoose story." Professor says he shall
be delighted, only he must speak to a friend first. He does so; to
some one at the other end of the room, and is not seen again, except
for a second by me, when I catch sight of his hat, which there is no
mistaking, as he is making a quiet exit by the front door.
Commander takes a seat between two Germans, with whom he enters
affably into such a conversation as his command of the language
permits ; i.e. at the rate of two words in five minutes, with an occasional
ja or win. Then he goes to sleep again. Then he wakes up. Then
he disappears.

YE gentlemen of Ireland
Who live abroad at ease,
A mighty little wonder 'tis
That yon are absentees.
Gire heed unto the newspapers,
And they will daily show
All the crimes—see the Times—
When the crimson drops do flow.
All we that would lire landlord«
Must bear arrears of rent.
And little though we should be paid,
Or none, must be content;
Or else, a tenant's bullet
Will quickly lay us low;
With a ball he pays all.
Whilst the crimson drops do flow.
The constant fears and terrors
Poor landlords must endure,
By day and night their souls affright;
They ne'er can rest secure.
Their slumber is disturbed
By voices crying "Woe!"
In a dream, with a scream,
While the crimson drops do flow.
With heaps of threatening letters,
Which slaughter doth enforce,
Assailed are they who dare pursue
With rogues a lawful course.
Whence cometh dire distraction,
For death's impending blow,
With a stain on the plain,
When the crimson drops do flow.
Sometimes our Irish villains
A life when they would seek,
To take a skulking coward's aim
Behind a hedge do sneak.
Sometimes their landlords "tumble"
In sunshine's open glow;
In the light, and men's sight,
When the crimson drops do flow.
Not Irish landlords only
Thus lire in care and dread;
Their stewards and their agents too
May look to be shot dead.
Whoever makes an enemy
Is very goon let know
What is what, by a shot,
When the crimson drops do flow.
Our Fenian scribes and spouters
Sedition frantic stir:
And mad mobs, with sham funerals,
Dead caitiffs re-inter.
Incendiary raving priests
The seed of murder sow,
Which take root and bear fruit
When the crimson drops do flow.
Just statesmen try kind medicines
To conquer our disease,
But cannot, with their righteous laws,
Our fell Yahoos appease,

Still about, yell and shout,

AN AWFUL MALLARD!
WHAT stories are told by the electric wire! Here is one of them
telegraphed from Paris the other day :—
"The Journal Officiel of this morning announces that all public receivers
and collectors of taxes will be allowed to receive payments in Papal coins
until the 80th of April next, at the rate of ninety-one centimes per franc."
Referring to this announcement, of course in the belief of it, the
Post observes :—
"By a curious coincidence we remark that the French Government haa just!
decided on taking no base coin from Borne. The Papal Government had pro-
tested that its iuue wa> as good ae the French, but the inexorable logic of
chemistry has demonstrated that the Roman lira is only worth ninety-one
centimes, and nut a hundred, and at ninety-one per franc only will it be
received in France."
"Did you ever see a wild goose a floatin' on the Ocean P" sings not
LONGIELLOW, but another fellow, LONGÏELLOW'S ebony fellow-
creature, and countryman in Old Zip Coo». Venturing to parody that
mighty line, let us ask,—" Did you ever see a wild duck a flyin* through
the air P" The biggest you can ever have seen was a mere teal to the!
above-cited canard.
The Papal lire base coin P Impious aspersion on the Government of
Pío NONO! Whopper, as the schoolboys say; set about for the
purpose of suggesting analogies as obvious as they are false. We,
however, dear DR. MANNING, will grant, and maintain too, that every
production of the Papal mint is alike genuine.
If the logic of Chemistry is inexorable, the logicians are excommu-
n ¡cable. Chemistry has demonstrated, by its logic, that the Roman
lira is only worth ninety-one centimes, has it P Ah! Chemistry may;
abo persevere in demonstrating that a given object is composed
mainly of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon—elementary sub-
stances. Chemistry be—anathema!
CHARITY IN THE BALL-ROOM.
AT a ball the other evening given by the PRINCESS MATHILDE, to
celebrate the "coining out" of the PBINCE IMPERIAL—
"The EMPRESS was in lemon-coloured silk, with a white tunic looped up
à lu tattrnotter, in diamonds and emeralds. A Paternoeter garniture is made
in imitation of the beads of a Bister of Charity."
Imitation is defined to be the truest form of flattery: but we ques-
tion if a sister of charity would feel herself much flattered at seeing
her beads imitated by diamonds and emeralds. A dress begemmed in
this manner may clearly be regarded as a very rich costume, but must
abo be esteemed a very poor imitation.
A COLLEGIATE CHARITY.
LADEES AND GENTLEMEN,
SOME of you may, possibly, be unaware of the existence of
an Institution named "The Royal Dramatic College." If cognisant
of its existence, you may not be equally acquainted with its nature.
Be pleased, then, to know that it is not a School of Preparation for the
Stage. The Royal Dramatic College is no such an establishment as
any College in connection with the Universities, or the Professions of
Medicine and Surgery. It grants no dramatic degrees. On no per-
sons does it confer the distinctions, for example, of Bachelor of Comedy,
or Farce; Master of Tragedy; or Doctor of Burlesque. It bas no
Professorships of Pantomime, can only have attached to itself ex-
Professors. But its Members are all of them Fellows, and, for it is a
Ladies' as well as a Gentleman's College, they are of either sex. They
are all fellows in old age. or at least in superannuation, used-up actors
and actresses, who, but for the College wherein they reside and are
maintained, would be fellows in want; perhaps even fellows in the
workhouse — that place of punishment in which modern British
Christianity afflicts the Poor. In the Royal Dramatic College these
fellows play out the Fifth Act of the Drama of Life.
In short, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Royal Dramatic College is a
sort of secular convent, or, we may say, civil barrack for aged and
necessitous members of the dramatic profession, supported by voluntary
contributions. Or, call it, if you will, an eleemosynary hotel. It is not
a lofty hotel; difiere from that style of hotel in one serious particular.
It wants a "lift." The Era thus speaks of it :—
"THE ROYAL DRAMATIC COLLEGE.
"It is with extreme regret that we hear this Institution is much in nerd of
assistance in order to enable the Council to regularly pay the pensions of the
residents of the College, and meet other expenses. A meeting of the Council
has juet been held, to ccnsidei the best means of raising ways and means, a
eeriee oflnoming and other special performances being proposed."
You are, doubtless, Ladies and Gentlemen, most of you playgoers,
and of course willing to combine with your own amusement the addi-
tional pleasure of affording succour 1o others who, many or most of
them, have amused yourselves, and, even in these days of the unintel-
lectual, unideal, and idiotic drama, may perhaps have occasionally
elevated your thoughts and feelings. Hear further, then, that :—
"Already MR. CHATTERTON (who has handsomely offered to pay all ex-
penses for the morning performance on the 12th of March,) Miss OLIVEII.
MR. B. WÏBSTBR, MR. ABRAHAMS, Мне. С. PITT, MR. HOLLINOSHEAD, and
other Managers, have agreed to put their houses at the disposal of the Council,
an example which will no doubt De followed by others, and a eeriee of brilliant
performances may therefore shortly be expected, which, we feel certain, will
be well patronised."
And should it be impracticable, for reasons, by any of you, to realise.
whilst you help to confer, a benefit in attending any of those projected
performances, allow the £ra, still further, to say to you :—
"In the meantime money is wanting, so we have determined at once to
open a special fund, to be called 'THE ERA DRAMATIC COLLEGE FUN»,'
towards which we shall be happy to receive subscriptions, and which we shall
hand over to the Council of Management."
None but the most successful players can possibly save the means of
self-support in decent retirement from the stage. Even the very super-
numeraries you, Ladies and Gentlemen, would not willingly let starve
— or die half-starved in an Infirmary which might be that of St. Pan-
eras. You may help to keep many a meritorious but indigent per-
former, past work, out of that, or some other lazar-house nearly as bad,
by contributing to the support of the Royal Dramatic College.
The "Worst of Irish Wrongs.
IRELAND has never thoroughly enjoyed the advantages of Magna
Charta. Even now trial by jury exists but partially in the Hibernian
part of the United Kingdom. The trial, in cases of landlord-shooting,
wherein the culprit generally gets acquitted, is almost always a trial
by perjury.

been lost at this pretty little game. Those who, in their anxiety to
avoid poverty, took this short cut to riches, are left to meditate the
well-known Virgulan proverb — "Incidit in Scillam qui vult vitare

IMPROVEMENT ON FURBELOW.
AMONO "Fashions for March," in the course of я "de-
tailed description of a number of dresses suitable for
various occasions," Le Follet specifies :—
"A costume of black poult de «oie, -with a croseway flounce,
headed by three rowe of velvet."
Flounces, many of them, have for a long time been
used to sweep crossings, not however designedly, perhaps.
But now we see that some milliner has devised a regular
crossway flounce, headed, apparently with a special view
to the purpose it is intended to serve, with three rows of
velvet. Reason and economy, however, suggest that,
instead of being beaded by three rows of velvet, this
flounce should be tailed with one row of broom.
SEVEKITY OF PUBLIC SAVING.
Мк. JOHN BULL has a true, faithful, and efficient servant in MR.
GUILDERS. "Economy with efficiency!" demands the British Public.
"There you are," answers the First Lord of the Admiralty, producing
the Navy Estimates. Hear him :—
"When we took office we found that the clerical force in London consisted
of 361 clerki nnd 102 «riten, costing; altogether £125,242 por annum. At
tliie prêtent time we employ 230 clerks and 142 writers, who cost £93.127.
There are therefore employed 124 clerk« i'ewer than la«t year, and that ho«
effected a saving of £32,115."
No doubt, in getting rid of those one hundred and twenty-four
clerks, as likewise of a great many dockyard workmen, the Govern-
ment proceeded, as MR. CHILDERS said they did, with all possible con-
sideration. They did the work they engaged to do for the British
Public as gently as they could. The British Public ordered the work;
the Ministry did but execute, in the mildest way they were able to, the
British Public's order. The distress they had to cause in so doing
distressed themselves. The profit of both their distress and that of the
clerks and workmen will accrue to the British Public.
Now then, it may perhaps be deemed not utterly preposterous,
absurd, and irrelevant, not altogether idiotically weak, not an absolute
fool's entirely inadmissible question, to ask any individual member of
the British Public how much happier he feels for the national gain of
£32,115, saved by discharging one hundred and twenty-four clerks, and
how much misery, on the other hand, has probably been inflicted on
each of those clerks by that saving?
Is there any man Jack who can aver that he expects to get so much
relief from taxation, and consequently so much joy, rapture, ecstasy,
beatitude, by the saving which has been effected in dismissed
Admiralty Clerks', and Dockyard Workmen's wages, that he acquiesces
in owing it to the beggary to which dismissal has reduced them P
Is it too simply a bray of interrogation to ask, finally, whether the
necessity for immediate retrenchment is so urgent that the British
Public cannot afford to let its ex-clerks and ex-workmen die out upon
retiring allowances, as it lets its ex-Chancellors, and other ex-M misters
of the Crown P Perhaps there would be even economy in forbearance
from some saving, of which no one individual could feel the benefit, in
order to go to the expense of treating the under-servants of the State
as considerately as the upper, and so conciliate numbers among the
working classes.

IN an action for compensation for injuries received in an acculent, on
the Great Northern Line, the Government Inspector, according to the
Pall Mall Gazette, stated that in railway accidents the carriages fre-
quently had "freaks" which it was impossible to explain by scientific
means. A statement like this makes one ponder whether there is not
anot her, and still more positive, cause of rail way accidents—the '' freaks"
of railway management, which it is impossible to explain by any means
whatever.

WHY SHAVE YOUR SOLDIERS?
WHEN tue Army Estimates come next under discussion, we hope
that some Economist will move that no more shaving tackle be sup-
plied to soldiers. The annual cost of soapsuds can be mi lauehiug
matter, though the matter may seem ludicrous. To this add the
expense of razor-strops and razors, of shaving cloths and shaving
brushes, and one may calculate what saving would be made merely by
not shaving.
Soldiers get into sad scrapes through not being clean-shaven; and
while the two regulation inches of the chin must, by order, be kept
beardless, it might be well to institute a daily shaving drill, so as to
ensure proficiency in the using of the razor. For the instruction of an
awkward squad, short and simple words of military command might be
shouted by the drill sergeant: such, for instance, as " Draw razors 1"
"Strop razors 1" "Handle noees !J> "Quick scra-a-ape!"

OUB candle manufacturers complain that they can't live because
their raw material has run up to such a figure. And their raw material
has risen in price because it is wanted for making butter. It is a sober
fact. It was but the other day that chemistry taught our manufac-
turers to consolidate and refine all sorts of oils and greases into the raw
material of candles. And now science has gone a step further, and
taught us how to turn that, which has but just been made to take
form and pressure as dips and moulds, into prime Irish" and "best
Dorset!" No wonder stéarine is going up: fatty matters rising to
the surface. Everything with grease ш it is worth putting under
process. Science will compel its precious oils, and extort its fatness.
But the last discovery, in this direction, is the grandest. It beats
what we had hitherto regarded as the triumph of industrial chemistry—
the extraction of Champagne out of petroleum. They have actually
found out how to turn Thames mud from Battersea reach into butter!
And so the whirligig of time brings about its revenges! We refused
to transmute our London sewage into milk on the Maph'n sands,
through the purifying stages of rye-grass and mangold, and, lo, our
sewage, in payment of our stupidity, is coming back to us, via the
Thames, in all its naked nastiness, as butter!
It is only fair of Father Thames. We poisoned him, and he means
to do his best to poison us ; or, to put it more pleasantly, we turned our
fatness into pollution of his bed, and he is giving us back our filth in
fatness, whether we will or no!
Here is a triumph for THWAITES, a chance for the Board of Works,
a use for the deposits of Barking, a way of turning to account the
hundreds of thousands of tons of sewage now poured weekly from the
pumps at Abbey Mills. At present they accumulate as Thames mud,
and are complained of as a nuisance. You have but to turn that
Thames mud into butter, to extract from it a bonus and a blessing!
Write up over the Abbey Mills pumping station "BAZALOETTE,
Butter-man to the Board of Works!" and let THWATTES and the
Board bind themselves to use their own extract as "the best sub-
stitute for butter at breakfast!" And in honour of that reach of
Thames where was made the first find of this choice delicacy fer the
breakfast table, let Batter-tea be re-christened and known henceforth
as Buiter-mere.
"AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER P"
IMPBOVING this text, the Echo is eloquent on the cold-blooded selfish-
ness and cowardly inhumanity of the men who, the other day, stood by
and saw a drunken double-murderer at Brent wood cut his wife's throat
first and his own afterwards. Another case of the same kind is that of
PATBICK JENNINGS, a Black Country ruffian, who beat out with a half
brick the little life he had not first jumped out of his wife's body with
his iron-clamped boots, in the sight of several men,
"Who didn't think it was their business to interfere, as it Was only hie
own wife he was punching."
The Echo wonders how human beings could look on at such acts
of murderous brutality without even lifting a hand. Where's the
wonder? They are only bettering the instruction of their superiors.
What is it but the doctrine of Non-intervention transferred from
public to private life F
In the face of this sickening story, can we wonder that BISHOP
SELWTN has thought it advisable to bring over, as his suffragan, a
clergyman who was of old his right hand in dealing with the
natives of New Zealand? All BISHOP SELWÏN'S and DB. ABRAHAM'S
united experience of savagery will not be too much for the work they
have before them in the Black Country.
At 7-30.
WHAT terrific sensation will the theatres next bring out? One of
them now announces Twenty Minutes with a Tiger! This beats the
Bull-fights.

SHAKSPEARE AT ASTLEY'S.
TÍTERE any reason why Sliak-
spearian plays should not
be played on horse-back?
None that I know of. M.
JULLIEN required a whole
etud for his Peler the Oreat
atCovent Garden, and TAM-
BERLIK sang some of his
finest tenor airs in that
opera, while sticking on, by
his knees, to the sides of a
cream-coloured charter,
that sniffed the blue-fire,
the resin, and the big drum
from afar off. As the As-
tleian poet sings, or should
sing,
Once more upon ту пайке
boards, my name's Ma-
герра!
Seeing that Othello with
MR. PHELPS and MR. and
MBS. HERMANN VÏZIN has
beenhighlysuccessfulat the
celebrated Amphitheatre,
and having been unable
to witness the interesting
performance (why didn't
MR. PHELPS play Manfred
on horseback at Drury Lane? or— but no, I '11 keep that idea for
some enterprising horsey manager, and make at least fifty-two thou-
sand pounds, ten shillings, and seven-pence three-farthings by its
representation), 1 beg to offer a few notes for stage-business, whenever
it may seem good to the Undaunted SMITH, Baron of Leicester and Cre-
morne, and Count d'Asnièresto "mount" SHAKSPEARE on horseback.
Othello is not, however, a happy selection, for the scene lies in Venice,
the only place where riding is a rather superfluous accomplishment.
However, by diligently consulting some authorities, and authorities are
always to be found for any particular view, the first scene might be
painted to represent Exterior of Brabanlio's Stables.
In the unwonted absence of the groom, Brabantio might be asleep
in the cock-loft. This must be explained by careful annotations; and
a reference might happily be made in the bill to "The Steed Stolen
and the Door Locked Afterwards," in allusion to Desdemona's flight
•with the Moor. Beyond this indication of horses there is little oppor-
tunity in the First Act for equestrian display.
The Second Act is in Cyprus—a sea-port town. We are on the
quay. Realise Dover, Folkstone, Boulogne, Calais, Dieppe, Brighton,
Biarritz, where you will in fact, only the more fashionable the
better, and there you have unlimited scope for horses, mules, donkeys,
goat-chaises, carriages, bathing-machines, and bath-chairs drawn by
jennets. The place u as brimful of animal life as a rare old Stilton.
Montano should enter riding his own horse. Second and Third
Gentlemen (the " Utility" department—vide Era) would enter on hired
horses. The Second Gentleman, having to exit first, can be perpetually
consulting his watch, as if he were afraid of out-riding the hour. This
is "business" apart from the text, and would considerably improve
what are now necessary, but uninteresting, parts. I will set down
certain "cues for business."
Situation. MONTANO, с., well mounted, with spurs and whip. First Gen-
tleman, L.H.,poorly mounted; no spurs, whip. Second Gentleman он а
different coloured steed; spurs, no whip, inter to them a Third Gen-
tleman on a cob (111. high); he has no spurs nor whip, a single
muffle and an old saddle.
Here follows what MR. DDCROW always called the " Dialect."
Third Gent, "For every moment is expectanc}
Of more arrivance."
Enter CASSIO in a light two-wheeled vehicle, of the period of courte.
While he talks First Gent, dismounts and tightens his girth.
MONTANO pats his horse. Second Gent., on hired horse, practises
holding his double reins. Third Gent, inspects the length of hit right
stirrup.
Crie» within. "A sail! a sail! a sail!"
Montana's horse plunges violently. Here he displays hie horseman-
ship, but must not say anything, out of respect to the Shakspearian
lines.

parts of the dialogue). "1 pray you, Sir, go forth," &c.

where, directs silently First Gentleman's attention to the foci
thai the hour has expired. First Gentleman shakes his head,
meaning that he is "not going \я just yet" andeiit, trotting,
Second Gentleman.
When Second Gentleman re-enters, it will be on foot, to show that
he has taken his horse to the livery stables, and has paid nie three-and-
sixpence, with a "trifle for the Ostler, please Sir."
Dfsdemona can be in a pony-chaise (of the period, vide authorities)
with Emilia and Roderigo; or, which is preferable, on horseback in
a semi-military costume, so as to fully realise OtMlo's, salutation, " Oh,
my fair warrior!"
In such scenes as a "Room in the Castle," "Another Room," and
so forth, the only chance of equestrianism is to introduce a performing
pony no bigger than a Newfoundland dog, to be petted during the
conversation. If, for any reason, this is impracticable, then let the
apartment be on the ground floor, with a large window commanding a
view of the marine parade, and outside, on felt, so as to be inaudible
(out of respect to the text) can promenade loungers, equestrians, pony-
carriages, &c., &c.
If the at-first-sight-apparently-insurmoTintable difficulties in the way
of such equestrian display can Ъе thus overcome in Othello, how easy
will it be in such plays as Macbeth, and the Historical Dramas P
Hoping that we shall in all this be credited with at least good inten-
tions towards the Drama generally, and SHAKSPEARE particularly, we
for the present leave our hints to the consideration of all those whom
it may concern. __^

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.

his answer is, "Never mina, Cockalorum, we "11 bustle 'em somehow.
DYNGWELL asks me to come and have a chat in his room. We fall
into German and French. I propose talking in both languages as a
capital plan for foreigners. He says, "Who 's a foreigner P" I reply,
"We are," which seems to astonish him. He had thought that
Englishmen never could be foreigners.
Happy Thought.—Suggest that he was thinking of Rule Britannia
and chorus. "Never, never, never, never, never shall be" foreigners.
I say, for practice, will he talk German to me F He won't. For
practice, will I talk French to him P I will. He doesn't understand
a word I say. He says he catches one now and then. We read French
to each other. Getting tired of this, he draws my attention to his
exercises, and professes to be getting "Quite the German."
Happy Thought.—To test him and his system. Represent the con-
ventionality of his exercises. Get one of mine (intended for my forth-
coming "Method of learning German, French and English simultane-
ously, if POPOOOD and GKOOLY will have it. Wish they 'd answer
telegrams) and try him.
For Beginners.—I am fat (gross). You are poor. We are fat and
poor. Am I fat or poor? Are you Ш or fat P He is old and little.
Is he little or old P I am rich (reich) and fatigued. Are you little
(klein), and fat (gross), and rich and ill (krank) P
Next Exercise.—"L am not tall. They are short and idle. Is the
father good and fat P The mother is happy and tall. The father and
the mother are si null and polite. My aunt is with the shoemaker, but
my uncle is in the garden. The wife of the doctor (des Arztes) is in
the fat carpenter's garden.
I have seen the tailor's uncle's boots (i. e, I have the boots of the
uncle of the tailor seen).
This is what DTNGWELL says is hit difficulty; viz., that the verb is
(so to speak) round the corner ; or comes, as it were, at the end of the
book.
Happy Thought.—There are more things in heaven and earth, DYNG-
WELL, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Ih sGVEi.L puts before me his idea of our exercise.
Dyng/icelts German Exercise.—Will the Cockalorum liquor? The
old Cockalorum is moppy. The tailor was bustled a bit by the wife of
the Cockalorum. The old cove went on the scoop. The venerable
Cockalorum ain't in good form. The shoemaker is a Hass. The
carpenter's grandmother was quite the drunkard. The gardener has
the papsylals in his great toe. Act on the square, boys, and be quite the
c'rrect card, your vashup. The carpenter retired to his virtuous downy.
My Aunt and my Uncle. The noble swell was all there. Well, my
Lord and Marquis, how was you to-morrow P Hallo! says the Dook.
Quite the tittup, says the Duchess. The Cockalorum was on. I '11
have your German Exercise!
"Now," says PYNGWELL, "get that into real up and down German,
and you 'II be quite the scholar."
Sunday.—In the Jesuits' Church. Expect, from seeing the crowd,
that I am going to see something peculiarly grand. Edge myself as
near as possible to the front row of people all standing. A German
hymn wnich I don't understand.
Happy Thought.—Never offend prejudices. Look devotional, and
hum as much of the tune as I can catch.
No ceremonial, but a sermon. After the first twenty minutes look
round to see if there 's any chance of getting out quietly. None.
Wedged in. Think of saying Ich Ыя sehr Krank, and getting them
to let me pass. Say this to my next neighbour. He shakes his head:
either he won't believe me, or doesn't understand. Try it once more
and give it up. Sermon lasts one hour at least.
Happy Thought (for any one who doesn't understand the language and
is uncertain what service he is going to hear).—Get close to the door.
Day of Departure.—Early in the morning get weighed at Miss
CATIIKHI.NH'S, I mean Miss CAROLINE'S, find I'm considerably
less.
Happy Thought.—Thinner.
Say good-bye to everybody. DYNGWBLL will accompany me to
Paris. Everybody in hotel suddenly seems to find an opportunity for
coming into my room. Waiters, chambermaids, porters, boots and
people whom I 've never seen beÍ9re. I call in to see the Bathman
and the Doncheman. They receive their gratuity sorrowfully, being
puzzled at the non-success of the vapour-bath in my case as compared
with that of Der Andere Mann.
The Commander appears at the hotel door. He is also coming to
Paris. "Capital fun, we three," he says. He promises that he "11 tell
oe the story of the Mongoose in the train.
MAIUMK DUF.MRI. lends me a triumphal car in the shape of a
magnificent carriage and pair, and coachman in livery (looking, on the
whole, something like a foreign ambassador's equipage in Hyde Park),
and I ) и. ÇA M'A u is determined to see the last of me. It 's a long
journey to Paris; ten hours.
Happy Thought.—Take light wine, chicken sandwiches, and French
literature to prepare for the gay capital. Get DYNGWELL to talk
French all the way there. Good practice.
Happy Thought.—Ask DYNGWELL and Commander to get light wine
and sandwiches, also.
Du. CASPAR'S interest secures us a carriage to ourselves—not to be
disturbed on any account.
Happy Thought.—As invalids.
Before going, take the names and addresses of every one I leave
behind. Will write to them; must see them; will all meet again,
jovially—somewhere. We all mean what, we say: at the time.
"Here 's old Cockalorum!" shouts DYNGWELL, catching sight ol
our good-humoured, kind-hearted Professor's hat. I ask him to
watch for the first volume of my Typ. Develop. He says, "He will do
so, with the greatest possible interest."
Happy Thought— Paid the BUI.
Happy Taught.—Less than I 'd expected. Grand Monarque excel-
lent and moderate.
In making this note I feel as if I was doing it for a Guide-Book.
Winter is beginning. Can't help looking forward, away from the
German stoves, to the wood fires of France and the roaring logs and
coal of England. Good-bye, sulphur waters! Farewell, Miss ELISA!
Impromptu in my Pocket-book :—
Fairest of all Aachen's daughters,
Thou who gave'st me sulphur waters,
See, I go to winter quarters;
Medical adviser
Says I may, so fare thee well,
What I feel I cannot tell,
No, nor in thy language spell,
Pretty Miss ELISA.
DYNGWELL says " ELISA" is pronounced "EL*SA." Oh, is it P very
well.
Happy Thought. -Think of rhymes and settle DYNGWELL. L*SA—
Please, Sir—teaser—greaser—tea, Sir—she, Sir—we, Sir—Pisa, &c.
To my Friend * * * »
"Youthful friend, say. have you quaffed
At her hands the sulphur draught P"
"Whose hands, и you please, Sir P"
Then I answer, "She the nymph
Of the boiling sulphur lymph,
Lovely Miss ELISA."
What 's "Lymph?" says DYSGWELL.
Happy Thought. To say, "My dear fellow, I suppose you've never
read any poetry P" Da. CASPAS draws our attention to the Station.
(If DYNGWULL'S going to be unpleasant on the journey, I shall travel
in another compartment with the Commander.)
Once more, adieu. Tickets. Luggage.
Happy Thought.—Booked through, and change nowhere ; so whatever
they say to us in German. French, or Dutch, we don't stir.
Where is the Commander?
Train in motion. Farewell. Au revoir. Hands to hats. The last
hand, the last hat, I can just see; and also sudden appearance of the
Commander, too late. He had stopped behind to tell the Professor the
Mongoose story ([ hear afterwards) and was obliged to leave in the
middle. Aix, farewell!
Happy Thought.—To be prepared for everyone, beginning with Мгь-
BüBJj in London coming up and saying, Well: left all your Aches
behind P " on my telling him that I "ve just come from Aix.
Happy Thought.—Shall simply observe I 've been staying at Aachen.
Telegraph to FRIDOLINE from Paris. "Home, sweet Home!
Wherever I wander, there 's no place like Home ! "—that is, of ccurse,

HEAR. LOUD SHAMESBURY. He speaks on the subject of biblical
revision, in a letter sent to the Times. Therein, at least the following
passage will be heartily applauded by all men, except the quacks, and
humbugs, and snobs :—
"And I Till mention that a rude and eudden descent from the majestic and
touching tones of our wonderful version to the thin, Frenchified, and tqueak-
ing sentences in modem use would be an irreparable shock to every English-
speaking man who has drunk in the old and generous language almost with
hie mother's milk."
Yes. Fancy the Authorised Version of the Old and New Testament
re-written in the phraseology of advertising puffs. And it would be if,
in so far as it was re-written, it were re-written in such phraseology as
that of modern devotion; that, for example, wherein occasional services
for thanksgiving and fasting days have of late years been usually com-
posed. Fancy the sacred text, possibly befouled even with the word
K reliable"!
But then, there is no reason why mistranslations, here and there, in
the Bible, should not be corrected in sound English. And surely all
luch mistranslations need to be corrected with every care. Take
another text than that of Holy Writ: the next to it in value with most
"English-speaking" men. No doubt the EARL of SHAFTESBURY has
read 811 AKSPKARE—at least BOWDLER'S Shakspeare. Although SIIAKS-
FEARE'S great works are plays, doubtless LORD SHAFTESBURY has at
least read them. He knows that they contain disputed passages,
doubtful words, and indubitable blunders. He never would dream of
questioning the expediency of endeavouring to restore, as faithfully as
possible, SHAKSPBARE'S original text. He must be desirous of its
restoration if he venerates SHAKSPEARE, and the more desirous the
more he venerates him. May it please his Lordship, therefore, to con-
sider whether his desire to get SHAKSPEARE'S text genuine would not
be increased rather than lessened by the knowledge that interpolations
and false readings, therein abounding, gave occasion to sceptics for
questioning the authenticity of the divine WILLIAMS F
But honour to the EARL OP SHAFTESBURY for his declaration on
behalf of the good old "well of English undented," and against the vile
modern sink of Frenchified and fine English undeodorised.
Fancy SHAKSPEARE in fine English :—
Falitaffloq. HENRY, I am no less asi oaished when I consider the
localities in which you are accustomed to employ your leisure, than
amazed in reflecting on the associates by whom you are surrounded.
Because, whilst on the one hand it is undeniable that a familiar
medicinal herb extends its growth with a rapidity proportionate to the
pressure it receives from passing footsteps, it is on the other equally
certain that juvenility, the greater the measure in which it is dissipated,
the more speedily does it experience the effects of friction.
Railway Economy.
OUB, Railway Directors decline to provide
For the public foot-warmers in chill winter-tide.
They contend that such comforts would cost them too dear,
And their shareholders' grumbling and growling they fear;
But this is at best a lame, feeble excuse
For refusing what elsewhere are widely in use.
In hot water so oft they "ve been found, we suppose
They dread burning their fingers while warming our toes.
National Defensive Provision.
THE Times, in a leader, timeonsly asks, "What is the true function
of the Militia P Is it to feed the Line, or to provide a permanent pro-
tection for these shores?" The latter, certainly. Let the Militia
provide a permanent protection for these shores, and we can trust the
Commissariat to feed the Line.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ASCLEPIUS HIS DAUGHTERS.
PUNCH, — If you please, Sir, I
mean other ladies than PANAKEIA,
HYGEIA and JEaix.
In a paper read before a meeting
over which the EARL o? SHAFTES-
BURY presided, at the Architectural
Gallery, Conduit Street, on the
subject of " Medicine as a Profes-
sion for Women," DB. DRYSDALE
said:—
"They were on the eve of a great
revolution in medical politics, and it
was hoped that a bill would be intro-
duced this Session making it necessary
to pal» only one state examination for
the three kingdoms in order to obtain
a licence to practise. He suggested
that ladies should petition to be per-
mitted to go up for this examination,
and, ш our Government wai a mort
liberal and able one, he thought this might be granted."
According to a report of the speaking which ensued :—
"Ыгав ГАГПУ пи, urged that the Supporten of this movement ought not
to be subjected to the opposition they received, inasmuch ai they were not
advocating an idea which waa novel, but were only desirous to return to a
work which was essentially womanly, and which was practised by the sex in
times long past."
Then spoke another lady, with the advantage of a special knowledge
of the subject in hand :—
"Mies G AUK KTT addressed a few observations to the meeting in favour of
every encouragement being given to women who desired to enter the medical
profession. She cautioned them, however, that, to become proficient in the
healing art, they must devote many years to persévérance ana study."
The necessity. Sir, of persevering study will, alone, we may be sure,
suffice to keep all women out of the medical profession but a very few.
There is therefore no sort of occasion for the opposition to the move-
ment on behalf of their eligibility to be members of that profession,
offered, conceivably, by no men out of it but fools, and by none in it
but trades-unionists; men of narrow-minded views and Broadheaded
principles. Assuredly, Mr. Punch, rather, every encouragement should
be given to women desirous to enter the profession of medicine.
Paterfamilias is a goose if he do not encourage any daughter of hie,
endowed with intellect, industry and resolution, who may evince a turn
that way. No daughter can Paterfamilias get so thoroughly off his
hands as a self-supporting one. Open the door of every secular pro-
fession to every woman qualified to enter it. Open the bar even,
forensic as well as tabernary, only insist on. the wig and gown—the
regulation gown—let the law of judicial vision be the same for female
counsel as for male. Why should not QUEEN VICTORIA have a regi-
ment of Amazons as well as the KING OF DAHOMEY, or his MAJESTY
OF SIAM? Only because if she might have them she would probably
not get them. Fighting women are very exceptional, though a late
pugilist, now in Valhalla, used to boast that he had a wife who could
beat any man of her weight in England. What law exists to prevent
women from being chimney-sweeps f—but there are not any. Nobody,
even in the good old times, ever heard of a climbing girl. Only fools
rush in where angels fear to tread, and women, all but very rare mad-
women, fear to tread the rough ways they are unfitted for. We, Sir;
you, and I, and MR. DISRAJÍU, are on the side of the angels.
But medicine is not one of those rough ways for a female practitioner,
except now and then when its path is the way across country; she
having been called up at night.
Women are no more unfitted to practise medicine 'than they are to
g-actise music. True we have no female HANDELS. MOZARTS, and
KETHOVENS. Neither are we likely to have a female HARVET,
HUNTER, or ABERNITHY. Women do not originate things. But it ii
quite possible we may have a female SÏUEN пл>i, or HALFORD, or even
a female ASTLEY COOPER.
The medical science, Mr. Punch, acquired by a lady-doctor here and
there might prove a leaven which would leaven the whole lump so to
speak, with apology for calling the fair sex a lump. And the lump
sadly wants leavening. When it had got properly leavened there
would soon be an end to advertisements of " corsets," cosmetics, and
ways of being made beautiful for ever; also an end of low dresses in
high life and high latitudes. The death-rate from bronchitis and
consumption would largely decrease. •
There would likewise be an end of Daffy and Dalby, and all
manner of domestic quackery in those upper regions where future men
and women make the noises which pious /ENEAS heard, the first thing,
in the lower. Moreover, we should hear much less of those noises.
And mark. Whilst the medical profession would be a resource for a
clever girl, who, having to live somehow, would like to live single, or
at any rate, having a soul of her own as well as a body, would hate to
sell herself in the marriage-market, it would by no means debar such
an one, matrimonially disposed, from matrimony. For what young
medical man wanting a partner, could do better than choose a medical
lady duly qualified (in every respect) for partnership P And every
non-medical man thinking to take a wife, would find his account in
taking a doctress who woiud know better than by continually breaking
the natural laws, to Irt herself in for everlasting headaches, faintings,

COM VA ii к Creuzot with the greatest and best-managed English iron-
works. Look at the state of the workmen and their families in the light
of such statistics as these—which have not been contradicted even
by M. ROCHEFOET, or any other of M. SCHNEIDER'S bitterest
enemies :—
"To begin with the accommodation provided for the workmen; we are
assured that there is for every man, woman, and child a space equal to
11 metres superficial, or 32 cubic metres—considerably more than the inhabi-
tants of Paris enjoy. No fewer than 700 gardens are let by the Company, at
the rate of two francs per annum. The Company have constructed nearly ten
miles of streets and over two miles of boulevards; they have provided publie
fountains yielding 600 cubic metres of water per day. MESSRS. SCHNEIDER
have founded five commercial and industrial schools, 16 free schools, and
16 nurseries for children of tender years. These establishments have received
in one year 4629 children, and only 29 who have not profited by these oppor-
tunities remain in ignorance. The school fee is 76 cents, per month for the
children of workmen, and a franc-and-a-half for other children, but some
700 children are received gratuitously. The education given comprises
reading and writing, French, history, arithmetic, geography, drawing,
geometry, mechanics, physics, and chemistry. The adult schools are attended
by about 600 workmen, and there are four special clanes for smiths, turnen,
finishers, and modellers. A library of some 2300 volumes, comprising all
kinds of works, has been provided. Two Catholic churches have t>een built
by the MESSH«. SCHNEIDER, who have also provided for Protestant worship.
The smallest wages earned at Creuzot amount to 3 f. 46c. per day. In 1848 the
sum was 2f. 60c. A grown man may rise to 8f. in the workshops, and 13f. in
the blacksmiths' shop. The population in 1836 was but 2700 souls; at the
last census 28,872, showing a rate of increase four times as great as the
average of France. The number of convictions for offences of all kinds is
considerably less than the average; and for offences against morality the
ratio is less than half the average. The savings' bank contains the deposits
of 1770 workmen, amounting in all to eleven millions of francs. A further
sum of two millions is invested in the works by 640 workmen, but can be
withdrawn at any time. No fewer than 450 workmen having ceased to
labour, possess among them no less than three millions of property, which, if
invested in land or houses, at Creuzot, realises something like 7 per cent "—
And then say whether the late strike is not indeed best described by
help of the name of the agitator who is said to have been at the bottom
of it—Assi. A more asinine quarrelling of workmen with their bread
and butter it would be difficult to conceive.

"There are very funny stories going about the new workings of the Public
Works Department. . . There is a capital account of a certain castor which
was bet oof an arm-chair, and which entailed réquisitions, correspondence,
inspections, visile, &c., day after day, till a van with two hones and three
men came to take off the arm-chair in triumph—and the castor came off the
day after the chair was returned !"—Army and Navy Gazette.
JOHN POUNCEB was a gentleman
Of limited renown,
A Government official he,
À Serrant of the Crown.
The room where he his country served
Had not received much care,
But POUNCKB, as its chief, enjoyed
A comfortable chair—
A chair with padded arms and back,
Its legs on castors raised,
Made in the dear old times before
Economy was praised.
There he had covered many a sheet,
Drafted, perused, and signed,
And sometimes when the sun was hot
There he had eke reclined,
Till on a day—the date you 11 learn
By writing to the Board—
One of the useful castors broke,
And POUNCER almost floored.
The reason of this sad mishap
Research has failed to find:
Perhaps it was the work that weighed
Too heavy on his mind.
Perhaps some secret, subtle force
J lad influenced the brass,
Perhaps—but speculation fails,
80 let the puzzle pass;
And rather tell of what was done
The mischief to repair,
Of all the efforts that were made
To reinstate the chair;
Of formal requisitions sent,
Of letters and replies,
Of the visits and inspections
To which the loss gave rise;
The hopes and fears, delays and doubts,
That seemed to have no end,
Before the Board of Works resolved
The furniture to mend.
At last they sent a roomy van,
A van with horses twain,
And three men to remove the chair,
And bring it back again.
The necessary work was done
With no intemperate haste,
The chair returned to POUNCER'S room,
The castor was replaced;
For one brief day, to be to him
All that he could desire,
Or by the busy, laden desk,
Or by the cheerful fire;
Then tocóme off anew, afresh,
The next ensuing morning,
Without a hint of what it meant,
Without a moment's warning;
And so excite in POUNCER'S mind,—
Where now suspicion lurks—
Anger—against the chair P Oh, no,
Against the Board of Works.

Mr DEAR WHALLEY,
You have not been on your legs so frequently this Session as
your wont has been in sundry others I nave Essenced. Is your seden-
tary posture the result of your reflecting that a Session means a sitting?
Or is your mind so harassed by the Council at St. Peter's,' that you
cannot take a part in the councils at St. Stephen's? I miss you, my
dear WIIALLEY; for I love a hearty laugh, and I rarely fail to get that,
when you are pleased to speechify.
What has just now specially recalled you to my memory is the
reading of a recent trial of two ruffians, indicted for luarislaughtering a
patient in a madhouse. They, his keepers, were convicted upon the
clearest evidence of causing this poor wretch's death by kneeing him,
and kicking him, and knocking him about, so that they broke a dozen
ribs of him confided to their keeping. For this they were awarded
seven years of penal servitude, although a brace of precious doctors
took their solemn oaths and swore that the ribs rniglit have been frac-
tured by a tumble out of bed, which, a better judge than they, the
Judge, did not think probable.
Now is not this a cise for you, or any other man, to bring before the
House, as a ground whereon to move for a Committee to iuquire into
the keeping of poor lunatics, with a view to the more careful inspection
of asylums? fractured ribs and broken breast-bones are, it. ьеешз, a
frequent cause of death among our madfolk; and though evidence in
such cases is difficult to get, their frequency alone is something more
than accidental, and is certainly suspicious. By jumping knees down
on a patient, ribs and breast-bone may be broken, without much out-
ward sign oí bruising; and in this way brutal keepers may knead a
man to death, without much danger of detection. You may call them
friends in knead for freeing him from other sufferings iu life to which
his ailments might expose him; but I think such friends in knead are
fouler ruffians in deed than many other murderers whom Jack Ketch
makes acquaintance with.
You will doubtless say that nunneries ought to be inspected, as much
as any other lunatic establishments. I may not quite agree with you
'in classing nuns with lunatics; but i think, wherever folks are
segregated from their fellow-kind, they need to be looked after by the
optic of publiiity. Human nature is the same iu nuns, and Agapemo-
nists, and keepers of asylums, and cruelty is commonly a part of
human nature. If convents and asylums were inspected as they ought
to be, not at set and stated times, and by blind, owlish boards of
guardians, but by paid, haphazard visitors, whose pay should be in-
creased for every fault which they detected, we should no longer hear
of nuns scrubbing floors by way of penance, or of madmen dying
foully with ribs broken by their keepers.
On this hint you may speak, with a good chance of being listened to;
and for this unusual pleasure you may thank your old friend,
The moon drinks sunlight sheeny.

Manchester's Medical Charities.
MANCHESTER, ever forward in works of beneficence, is now making
a strenuous effort to free her Medical Charities from a rather appalling
debt of between £5,000 and £6,000. A Committee of upwards of 200
principal Merchants, under the Presidency of MB. WILLIAM AGXEW,
has been formed for conducting a Dramatic Festival, MR. KNOWLES,
of the Theatre Royal, having most liberally placed all the resources or
his establishment, free of any charge, at the service of the Committee.
If the result does not exceed the Committee's most sanguine expecta-
tions, Mr. Punch knows nothing of Manchester.
ITALY'S HOPE AND FEAR.
A NOTE from Rome, in the Pall Mall, creates some misgiving by
the information that :—
"The Vatican boaets that new adhesions to the dogma of infallibility hare
reached the Holy Father from Bishops incapacitated by age and infirmity from
attending the Council."
This is more intelligible than satisfactory. One understands what
view bishops in their dotage would be likely to take of Papal infalli-
bility. The same view is unlikely to be taken by Members of the
Council in full possession of their faculties. It is therefore to be
feared that infallibility may fall through. So much (he worse for the
hope that France will cease to uphold the Temporal Power, and that
Rome win become the capital of Italy.
THE OLIVER PARTY.
ТПЕ neat little theatre in Dean Street is about to change its manager.
Dolphins before they die turn many brilliant colours, and the present
Manageress of the Royalty is determined to leave her pretty house
with brilliant colours flying and with honours thick upon her.
"Susan of the Black eye" has been revived by the exertions of the
fair Lessee, the graceful Miss CAROLINE PARKES and the careful Miss
KATE BISHOPP, and goes as freshly as when it first saw the footlights.
We wish Miss OLIVER every success for the future, and thank her not
only for giving us some cle-ver comedies, but for taking care of that
rather fast party Burlesque, by not allowing it to insult its betters, and
keeping a careful eye on its wardrobe.

CHIESA BUFFA, HOLBORN.
THE performances at the Theatre Ritual, St. Alban's, Holborn, still
continue without alteration, notwithstanding the monition issued
against the Manager of that establishment by the Privy Council Cer-
tainly that gentleman is to be credited with a vast deal of the quality
which in a good cause is called perseverance. According to я contem-
porary :—
"On a former occasion the petition was that MR. MACKONOCHIB had not
obeyed the monition ы to the elevation of the consecrated elemente and ав to
prostration before them. He was directed to pay the coeta, and warned as to
the alleged prostration. The petition to their Lordehipe now IB on the jrround
that he permit« by hie curates Buch elevation and prostration, and it IB sub-
mitted that the monition of their Lordehipe has not been obeyed."
What power has the Privy Council to enforce its monition against
the Manager of St. Alban's P That reverend gentleman may be in a
position to set the Privy Council, as he sets the (Ecumenical, whose
rites he burlesques, at defiance. The LORD CHAMBERLAIN, perhaps,
could effectually deal with him, and might therefore be applied to Ъу
persons who are displeased by the St. Alban's exhibitions with a
petition to interdict them. That his Lordship surely must have power
to do, on the ground that being adaptations of the Roman Catholic
Mass and other offices, played in character and costume, with spoken
dialogue, and music, they come within the description of theatrical
entertainments, enacted in a building not duly licensed for the purpose.
From s Bookworm.
How useful it is to know something of bibliography! If GANDEBSON
had possessed but a smattering of it, he would have been saved from
making the unlucky remark, that he was convinced great collectors
opened very few of their books to read them, because he had noticed
that the catalogues of their libraries, when offered for sale, contained
numerous "uncut" copies.
IMPERIAL ECONOMY.
WE live in wonderful times. Only look at this :—
"It haï been remarked that the EMPRESS Еио&пв this year sometimes
appears twice in the eame day in the ваше dress, which was never the case
before."
This unparalleled economy the French papers attribute to the pressure
of reform which has been put upon the EMPEROR. His Majesty has
made certain liberal professions, and deems it constitutional to be a
little stingy. So the EMPRESS is obliged to wear her dresses twice,
and who can tell what pangs this retrenchment may have cost her F
We hope her self-denial may largely bear good fruit, and that ladies
generally may imitate her prudence. The EMPRESS sets the fashions,
and ladies love to copy her as nearly as they can, but it is new for
them to learn from her a lesson in economy. If the EMPRESS con-
descends to wear the same dress twice in four-and-taenty hours,
MRS. Sunn may surely be satisfied in future with only ordering a
new dress not more than once a week, and MRS. BROWN may some-
how even manage to exist for as long as a whole fortnight without
buying a new bonnet.
Light Literature.
WE see advertised among the latest batch of novels a story with the
title of The Baronet's Sunbeam. If this should prove successful, we
may expect to see it followed by The Marquis's Moonthine, and indeed
a further sequel may with safety be anticipated, entitled somewhat
similarly, The Сиия(ега'з Starlight.

ST. PATBICK'S MISTAKE.
MAY there not be, possibly, in the Irish problem something more
than is dreamt of in your philosophy—you whose philosophy cornea
from JEBEMY BENTHAM? A conceivable solution of that problem is
suggested by certain statements made by one great exponent of
mysteries, the fellow-countryman of LINN.SUS and of MBS. OTTO
GOLDSCHMIDT. In one of his numerous works EMANUBL SWEDENBORG
discourses of certain things which he calls "evil uses." Thereby he
means beasts and other creatures noxious to man, and used to injure
man, but abo subserving some beneficial end, by, as he says, contri-
buting "to absorb malignities." Among these " evil uses " he expressly
mentions "poisonous serpents," and "frogs." Now Irishmen boast
that Ireland breeds no vipers. The batrachians as well as the ophidians
were put out of the way by St.Patrick, as we all know by preaching :—
"He drove the frogs into the bogs,
And banithed all the varmint."
But, in so doing, it may be that his Sanctity conferred somewhat
the reverse of a boon upon the huid on the top of whose "high hill"
he delivered the discourse which had that preternatural effect. What
if the trouble which even our GLADSTONE experiences in governing
Ireland be in truth owing to the want of frogs, toads, poisonous
serpents, and other "evil uses" to "absorb malignities" imparted to
the air of the Emerald Isle from a worse atmosphere P Those maligni-
ties, in the absence of venomous snakes and the like, may for aught we
know, embody themselves in Fenian journaliste and sympathisers with
Fenians; in agrarian assassins, and incendiary priests. Pending,
therefore, the discussion of the Irish Land Bill, would not the Govern-
ment do well to propose a vote for the immediate importation into
Ireland of adders, toads, frogs, in numbers large enough to constitute a
variety of "evil uses" sufficient for the absorption of "malignities"
at present rampant amongst Irishmen in human forms? To be sure
it might be found that no common adders or vipers in any quantity
would have capacity to absorb and condense into material venom the
"malignities" of the Irish "1 rreconcileables," and that, to get them
effectually absorbed by the means, if practicable, indicated by the
Swedish Seer, it would be necessary to acclimatise a lot of cobras, cop-
perheads, and rattle-snakes.
PHILOSOPHY FOR FREE LIVERS.
A LEARNED Doctor of Physio has augmented Medical Literature
with a new treatise on The Pkilotophy of Rheumatism and G nui. What
philosophy is that P The Epicurean, rightly understood, which teaches
epicures what to eat, drink, and avoid; what to avoid no less than
what to eat and drink. The philosopher whose philosophy keeps him
free from gout and rheumatism is always a peripatetic one; he walks
about a great deal to equalise his circulation, and to work off in vapour
the superfluities which a philosophical turn, generally combined with a
predilection for good living, is apt to introduce into the bodily system.
For the rheumatic or gouty patient the only possible philosophy would
be the Stoic, if the idea that any quantity of wisdom, knowledge, and
reflection, can operate in the least degree as an anodyne, were not
moonshine.
A Responsible Police.
BY telegraph from Dublin, on St. Patrick's Day, we were ediCed by

"This evening the Armagh grand jury found a true bill of manilaughter
against Svii-lNM'Ecroii NKKNAN for firing on the crowd on the evening of the

The Grand Jurymen of Armagh apparently know how to encourage

PEEPS INTO THE STUDIOS.

HE impending Exhibition of the Royal Academy
(the three hundred and sixty-fifth) will be considered
above the average by those artists who are fortunate
enough to find their productions accepted, decidedly
below the average by those who are so unlucky аз to have their works
rejected, and about the average by old ladies, general public, and
young people who talk to you of LANDSEEB and MILLAIS at drums,
dances, &o.
It may interest our readers to glean something beforehand of the
principal pictures that will confront their gaze, on the inaugural
Monday in May, on the walls of the salons of Burlington House.
HieiHPLYTK (in addition to his other work, The GorJian Knot)
will show a magnificent classical subject just completed. .¿ËSCHYLUS,
SOPHOCLKS, QÜINTILIAN, and EURIPIDES are represented welcoming
to the Elysiaii Fields, brilliantly illuminated with the Electra-ic
light for the occasion by MESSRS. VULCAN and CYCLOPS, the
principal characters in their afl'ecting dramas. These personages,
grouped in trilogies, are seen clustered round PELOPS on. Mount
Hippocrene, who is consulting -aîscuLAPius as to the rheumatism in
his ivory shoulder, while AJAX dismounts from his ivy-wreathed dithy-
ramb, drawn by coursers from the Augean livery stables, and kisses his
flashing thyrsus to IPHIOENIA (in Tauris), engaged in an archery
contest with PHILOCTKTES, who wears the poisoned peplum which
HERCULES gave as a wedding present, along with six silver nectarspoons,
to PROMETHEUS on his marriage (after he recovered from that dis-
tressing liver complaint) with CLYTEMNESTRA ¡u the gardens of the
Choephorae, attended by ten bridesmaids. An efficient chorus, in-
cluding the Musts, the Graces, the Furies, the Harpies, and the blue-
eyed Symplegades, their brows bound with amaranth and fresh cadu-
ceu9, and with snakes, chimaeras, &c., in their gory locks, are depicted
singing a selection ш the back garden from the (Klipus Hindus,
HECUBA accompanying them on a new Grand Concordance, made by
OKPUEDS expressly for the performance. To the thousands of visitors
to the Academy who have the Greek Tragedians at tueir fingers' ends,
this splendid picture, with its well balanced composition, its brilliant
colouring, its tender feeling and refined motive, cannot fail to prove
u rich and intellectual treat.
HOLME PAYNTER has again produced several of his charming
transcripts of that domestic happiness and fireside felicity which make
us the envy of surrounding nations. We have only space to describe
one, his chef il'œuvre, in which he has, if possible, transcended even
himself—it is entitled, simply, "The First Pancake." A dear little
fellow, three or perhaps three ttnd a quarter, nicely dressed in the costume
of the time, with a clean white pinafore, is seated anxiously ou a high
chair, at an ordinary dining t*b)e completely covered with a snowy
riut ii, while Mamma proudly deposits pu his plate the delicate pancake
(or is it a fritter ':"> with which the smiling nursemaid has that moment
entered from the kitchen. An elder sister, iu red hair and bright
Tartan frock, is busily engaged cutting a large and tempting orange
into quarters; and the life-like fidelity with which the pips are depicted
only needs to be seen to be recognised as a triumph of naturalistic
manipulation. We are much mistaken if this little gem does not elevate
its gifted author to the highest rank in his profession.
COMESHAW has once more had recourse to the annals of his native
land (see Doomsday Boole, pp. 1008-11) for a most touching scene—
CHARLES THE SECOND, after the fatal Battle of Tillietudlem, hiding with
the great seal between two feather beds in a public-house at Wapping,
while an infuriate mob, headed by LORD GEORGE GORDON and TITUS
OATES, are breaking open the doors, clambering in at the windows,
swarming up the spouts, peering down the chimneys, peeping through
the keyholes, tearing up the gas-piping and door-scraper, and demanding
beer and their sovereign's blood of the trembling landlord, who is seen
cautiously opening the postern, in a well-worn buff jerkin and scarlet
beretta, armed with a rusty petronel, and accompanied by FLORA
MACDONALD (in the forty-second plaid) and the Ordinary of Newgate.
COMESHAW'S well-earned laurels will not suffer by the exhibition of
this his last, and perhaps best morffa«.
MOUNTAYNE DEWE revels in a landscape of supreme beauty and in-
finite pathos. A wild and solitary campagm, sparsely strewn with,
cairn and cromlech on which moss and lichen stray in unchecked
luxuriance, stretches away in its lonely might to the glimmering
horizon. Wild creatures ramble about in the foreground, and in the
middle distance a party of convalescent carbonari slowly return to their
evening meal. The golden-crested eagle and the many-hued kingfisher,
softened by the beauty of the scene, rest together in harmonious
juxtaposition, and gaze on the westering sun sinking in his evening
glory behind the Transpontine Hills, covered to their summits with the
lovely blossoms of the beautiful Alpinulapeppermintitis, amid which goats
and their young gambol sportively to the sound of the vesper bell. Over
all the black rebellious clouds, gathering from every known quarter of
the compass, portend the approach of the much-dreaded Malaria, before
which the benighted condottiere, wrapping his capote more closely rcund
his gaunt form, hurries to the nearest VUleggiatura for shelter and refresh-
ment. All is in keeping, in perfect harmony, in this weird-like delinea-
tion of Mature in her sterner aspects—the high lights are beyond praise
—and MR. MOUNTAYNE DEWE may be congratulated on having struck
the right key iu his selection of sober pigments, and in the " vehicle"
he has adopted for the material embodiment of the conceptions of his
lofty genius.
The portraits we have had the privilege of examining are many in
number and unrivalled of their kind. We were particularly struck
with one by Toucnup, of the MAYORESS OF BARTLEMERE receiving a
deputation of its most influential inhabitants, to present her with a
silver cradle, in commemoration of her having presented a sou and
heir to the Chief Magistrate of that ancient city, Л IU;A и л м FROSBT
HAWKINSON, ESQ., during his period of office. The frame is magnifi-
cent, and the attitude of the portly nurse who is in attendance on her
mistress (with the baby) dignified and imposing. TOUCIIUP will not
recede from the place he occupies in public estimation by this felicitous
rendering of a pleasant and genial custom in our borough municipalities.
In the Sculpture Gallery EVE, UNDINE, OPHELIA, ŒNONE, JOAN OF
ARC, and our own KOYAL FAMILY, will be adequately represented,
There will be a great many busts; and some extraordinary figures—
amongst the spectators.
THE INFALLIBLE OUT-AND-OUTER.
IT is pleasant to have any thing to say that redounds to the POPE'S
credit. Here is somewhat, from the Times :—
"The bishops have been very clamorous lately for leave to go home by
Enster, and make 'holy oil 'for the ensuing year. Pros THE NINTH is
equal to the emergency, and has issued a document to the en'ect that the
remaining stock of holy oil is to be mixed with sufficient new oil to make a
supply for the next year, and that the oil so mixed ie to have the same virtue
as ii'every particle of it had been consecrated."
So no doubt it will. In that matter of "holy oil" Pío Nono has
managed his bishops with an adroitness equal to any ever exercised in
dealing with corresponding parties, though of another persuasion,
whose scruples were obstructive, by OLIVER CKOMWELL. Who does
not admire his determination? His Holiness believes in his own claims,
he disbelieves in modern Progress, and he acts out his belief and disbelief
in defiance of everything and everybody. In this thoroughness there
is real sublimity.
Tho Obstinacy of the Green Fever.
PEOPLE must not wonder that an exacerbation of the Irish febrile
symptoms has followed the administration of the Church Act sedative,
nor should they be surprised if the Land Bill anodyne should be thrown
in without immediate effect, though the Peace Preservation attringent
may produce a better tone. Home was not built iu, a day, nor will
Ireland be, ha, ha! cured in an instant.

PUNCH, OB THE LONDON CHAKIVAKI.
FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENCE.
MB. PUNCH to MASTER GUTTEBBLOOD, i* Tow», and MASTER
CHAWBACOK, in the Country.
Mr DEAR LITTLE BOYS,
Yon have been much in my mind lately, аз in everybody's
mind that has a mind. Between your two families you make up the
mass of the rank and file at least of Young England. Looking at Old
Engjand by the light of Poor Law and Police Reports, Criminal
Statistics, Education Returns and Sanitary lîhiebooks, as well as the
lesser lights of my own eyes and ears, I don't like the notion of your step-
ping into your fathers' sins, and sorrows, and sufferings, as part of your
inheritance. I want you to be better fed, betterbehaved, thriftier, soberer,
healthier, kinder, cleaner in your clothes and talk, more God-fearing
and God-loving, more thoughtful of your families and your fellows, of
those you work for, and those who work for you, than yonr fathers
were before you. And that you may be all this, I want you, first
of all, to be better taught. Modern gardening has shown us that
there is no way of improving the fruit of the tree like root-pruning and
root-feeding: and 1 want to see you growing a good deal better fruit
than we have been in the habit of sending to market off you. Teach-
ing you is the only way to bring this about; and so the Government
has at last come to see, and has been doing what it could for thirty
years past, to get yon to school, to set your little minds a-growing in
the right way for bearing the right fruit. But there has been one
thing m the way—the black coats. There was the Parson, and the Priest,
and the Dissenting Minister all wanting to have yon all to himself,
each protesting it would be your ruin, here and hereafter, if any of the
others was allowed a finger in your pie. And so. in the name of
the big R, Religion, a good many of you were denied yonr lesser three
R's, and went without teaching, while the churches squabbled who
should teach you. No wonder many sensible, straightforward people
got out of patience with this, and said they 'd be hanged if it should go
on any longer. If Parson, Priest, and Minister couldn't agree how to
work at you, at least neither Parson, Priest nor Minister should longer
prevent the work. Ton should be taught without them. Not one of
them should set foot in a Government school. If they insisted on
haying schools of their own, they should pay for them. But Parson,
Priest, and Minister combined to say "No to this, and so did a great
many who held with them, and the row over you got louder and
bitterer than ever.
At last a clever, hard-headed, hard-working, friend of mine, called
W. E. FORSTER, was set by the Government to devise a way of putting
things to rights—of having you taught, and yet not denying you, if it
could be avoided, that best part of teaching which shows men their
relations and duty to God and their neighbours commonly called
religious teaching. So W. B. FORSTER went to work with à will, as he
always does at everything he sets about, and contrived a plan. All the
schools now working, under Government inspection, were to be left.
But they do not meet all the needs of town or country. How were the
gaps to be filled?
All over the country there were to be School Boards chosen. In-
pectors were to examine the schools in every parish, and say if they
were sufficient in quantity and quality. If they weren't, the Education
Office was to let the School Boards know of the deficiency, and call
upon them to make it good; and if they wouldn't, to make it good for
them.
There was to be a School Rate to help the School-pence and the
Government Grant. Those of you whose parents conld not afford to
pay School-pence for you were to be taught free.
These School Boards were to make bye-laws fixing the conditions on
which parents should be compelled to send their children to school.
They were further to decide what the religious teaching 01 the School
should be, or whether there should be any, seeing that in some
places the bulk of you would be Protestant; in some, Papist; in
some, of tho Established Church; in some, Dissenters; while m some
large towns all sects would be so mixed up together, that the only way
would be to leave the religions teaching to be done quite apart from
the three R's, and make no provision at all for it in the ordinary School
lessons. But Ibis, mind you, was only where it couldn't be helped.
It was a painful necessity, not a desirable consummation. Whatever
the religious teaching was, no child, as I have told you, was to be
forced to attend it whose parents wished him kept away for religious
teaching in his own creed.
Wtll, now. don't you think this was a very clever plan of MR.
FOHSTER'S for getting over the difficulty of the black coats, and yet
not shutting out religions teaching from Schools, except where it made
the School impossible P
So I thought; and so most people thought, I fancied. And strange
to say, for once so the black coats seemed to think—at least the Parsons
—who used to be the most difficult to satisfy—and a good many of
the Ministen.
But there are some who are not satisfied yet, who want to make
MB. FOBSTER'S exceptional case—of no religious teaching—the rule
for all schools. When I argue with them, "Don't you see no child is
to be obliged to attend religions lessons? The little Presbyterian is not
to be catechised into the Establishment: nor the small Protestant
massed and mummeried and mariolatried into the Church of Rome:
nor the little Jew Mortaraed into a Christian." "Ah — yes —" they say,
"that's all very weLL as regards the faith of the children— that's safe
enough, we admit — but how about the credit of the Church their
parents belong to F Do you think, as a Dissenter, I am going to stand
Establishment lessons in the School I pay rates to — or viee versa?"
And on this point it seems, a good many of them mean to take their
stand between you and MR. FORSTER'S schools— insisting that religious
teaching shall be excluded from all of them; because it will, probably,
have, per force, to be excluded from a certain number, in the large
towns.
Now. my little friends, this might be all very well for those who
were likely to get religious teaching elsewhere, but a good many of
you, I'm afraid, if you don't get it in school, are likely to go
without it altogether. And, whether or no, the bulk of the English
people seem to be of opinion — they may be wrong, but I think they
honestly believe — that some simple religious teaching is a good and
a needful thing ш the schools yon are sent to. They don't want
to cram the doctrines or catechisms or creeds of this or that Church
down yonr throats, but they think that you might be, and ought to
be, taught the great lessons of Christ's deeds and words, and the laws
of duty to God in which are the roots of duty to man. Because, here
and there, sects are so mixed, churches so balanced, that their strifes
and jealousies may prevent this — which case MR. FORSTER has pro-
vided for — this is no reason, they maintain, for saying that such teaching
shall be shut out of all schools whatever. I really do not think — as far
as I can judge — that the English people wish, or will consent, to have it
so shut out. They do not desire to give any Church the right to force
its creeds or catechisms on children who belong to other churches; but
that guarded against by what is called a " Conscience Clause," binding
on all, they would prefer schools in which is taught such simple religion
ьз you, my dear little boys, sorely need, and may all of you safely take in
tit the hands of any Church whatever. At least I think so. If I am
wrong, 1 am sorry for it. For 1 fear, as 1 said before, that for a good
many of you no religious teaching in school means no religious teach-
ing at all. For all of you, school-teaching with religion shut out from
it, seems to me to mean school-teaching starved and stunted, and
stripped of what in it is most likely to make you better boys and better
men.
I have always been vexed with the Churches for thrusting their rival
claims between you and the school-door.
When a plan has been hit upon, as it has been by MB. FORSTER,
that robs these rival claims of all power to oppress, I would rather
that religion was, as the rule, let in, than that it was shut out, as the rule.
Which it shall be is the alternative now about to be fought out.
I can (inly regret, my dear little boys, that the battle should be fought,
as it has been so long a fighting, over your poor little souls, and minds,
and bodies. I should once have said, I grieve that while the Churches
are hot in strife you should be left out in the cold. But that is not
the right way to put it now. Those who are now barring your road
to school are not the Churches, but those who insist that no Church at
all shall have a hand in your teaching when you have got there. I
have been accustomed to think that it was the Established Church's
jealousy of the Dissenters that kept you ignorant, now it looks as if
you were to be kept in the dark oy the Dissenters' jealousy of the
Established Church, working with those who distrust and dislike equally
Church and Dissent, and all forms of religions creed.
I am very sorry to find that so many who have till now fought hard at
MR. FORSTER'S side to get yon taught, should be fighting against him,
when he has hit on a way which lets //»" into school, without shutting
out the common Faith that seeks entry there along with you, and which
must always be your best schoolmaster, whoever may be the other.
Forgive this long and grave, if not dull letter. I felt the subject
was too important to be silent about, and too serious to joke upon
Your affectionate old friend,
Odium Theologicum.
THE Time»' Special Correspondent at Rome, referring to the Papal
journals, says :—
"A happy thought has struck them apropos to the KIM; OF BAVARIA.
Lou is THE FIRST bet hie throne by a si I lj attachment to LOLA MONTES, and
a similar infatuation for DR. DÖLLINOBH may be attended with the like

The Papal journals, intentionally or unintentionally, disregard the
British maxim which says " Comparisons are odious."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAKL
HANDY-CAPPING.


iss DENSE presents her compliments to Иг. Punch, and
begs to offer to his notice a few reflections on a subject
•which has long caused her much painful perplexity.
I never could imagine what business men could pos-
sibly have with handy-capping, or, indeed, with any other
branch of millinery. That seems to be woman's peculiar province—
her artistic mission; for are we not Nature's Cabinet Ministers?
and does not the Crown—please pardon a little pun—naturally look
to us for its supplies?
Handy-capping (a most nonsensical term, but graphic, certainly, to
. some extent) as I understand it, is the art of arranging bead-dresses
I generally, and the softly-toned caps of hopeful widows, &c., in par-
ticular, so as to captivate gentlemen of Mr. Punch't (middle) age and
natural susceptibility. We Know, by sad observation, that many mem-
bers of our circle are often left behind on the platform of Celibacy by
the ordinary trains running daily to the terminus of Bliss. These for-
lorn ones after 35'0 anxiously look to handy-capping as an express-
engine to transport them along an incline the gradients of which are
sometimes very severe. As a practical engineer justly observes, Love
is a locomotive that never did run smooth. But 1 apprehend that I am
digressing. To conclude.
As fish are caught by paste, so are bachelors, if it be in the shape of
a brilliant. But handy-capping is less expensive, and sometimes equally
successful; and many charming couples, of some experience in life,
owe their present felicity entirely to the ingenious manipulation of a
few yards of Honiton lace.
P.S. My cousin RICHARD, looking over my shoulder (how he came
in unobserved I can't imagine), tells me, rather curtly, that I am writing
nonsense. He explains handy-capping in scientific phraseology, as
having relation to the acknowledged principle of "weight for age."
In illustration, he observed that a lady of thirty would, by the rules
of handy-capping, be expected to carry with her to the Hymeneal goal
3000 pounds (sterling); one of thirty-five a lump sum (lam quoting
Л rciiAiU) verbatim) of 3500 pounds (sterling); one of forty a ditto of
4000 pounds (sterling); and—and so on. He concluded his discourse
in these words :—" EUPHEMIA, you had better accept DR. DIBSLOVB'S
offer without further hesitation. You are now twenty-eight, and you
have 2800 pounds (East India 5 per Cents.). In two years time you
•will be expected to make it up to 3000—that is, if the Doctor under-
stands handy-capping as well as most D. C. L.'s do."
Is that really what men mean by handy-capping, Mr. Punch?
FIYE COUNTIES ON FULE!
THERE has gone forth a word
Which five counties hath stirred
To a high pitch of fierce indignation,
And hatb caused earth and sky
To resound with the cry,
Far and wide, "No more Centralisation!"
There 's announced, no mere dream,
But a Government scheme,
With arrangements provided to work it,
For effecting a change
As unwelcome as strange:
'Tis proposed to annul the Home Circuit!
People angrily shout:
If this plan 's carried out,
They '11 be lowered, or injured, or undone
Local lawyers will smart
When the cases, in part,
Shall be sent to be tried up in London.
If, as also designed,
Of the weightier kind,
To try some, they extend Quarter Sessions,
That will ask Judges, more
Of Law's technical lore
Who possess, than the Chairmen's possessions.

Are alarmed and afraid
For their dignity, greatness, and glory,

Though apart, on each side;

wish to hold any (Economical Counsel to ascert our Impalpability, yet I
should like to know what security there is for the foundations of Church

THE THEATRE FOE THE PEOPLE.
RUSSIA may well be described as a benighted country! Bat of all
the queer notions ever bred of barbarism, commend us to one in the
Pail Mall's latest "notes from Russia." Conceive a Commission
appointed to examine the question of the establishment of a "Theatre
fur the People!" And more; imagine the Commission reporting
strongly that such a theatre should be constructed! A theatre with a
moral object! A theatre meant " to divert the people from foolish,
vulgar and gross amusements, by providing them with healthy and
elevating spectacular entertainments at a cheap rate"! A theatre to
contain seats for 2,350 people—say something between Drury Lane
and the Lyceum—with 1,300 of the seats, at prices varying from Щ. to
1 •/., and the others from 4</. up to ¡i.<. W.! This infatuated Committee
farther report that such a theatre might be made to bring in a profit
of £5,000 a year—or ten per cent, on the capital employed. They
recommend that the management should be entrusted to a competent
private person, of experience, taste and refinement, and have prepared
a repertoire of 140 pieces in the Russian language, original and trans-
lated, calculated, they think, to forward their object of entertaining
and elevating.
They further recommend that lotteries, masked balls, and the sale of
spirituous liquors be forbidden in the "Theatre of the People."
Hear that, ye stunning sons of the music-halls—hear that, frequenters
of our splendid saloons and brilliant bars! Contrast this barbaric
dream ota Russian Blue Book, with the civilised reality of London,
where Free Trade in theatres does its work, and the demand is allowed
to create the supply of theatrical pabulum for the people, from the
Victoria to the penny gaff! The idea of the people being condemned
to "healthy and elevating " entertainment; when their betters can
revel in the SCHNEIDER, the MENKEN, the Cancan and the Opéra
Bouffe, tho indecent burlesque, the breakdown, and the Sensational
drama!
The next thing will be some idiot proposing a Joint Stock Company
Limited, of other idiots, who think that the theatre might be made a
means of education for the many and of culture and delight for all!
Imagine these idiots subscribing their money—of course they would
dispense with dividends—to realise their idea, by hiring a theatre,
paying a competent and cultivated manager, charged to select the best
actors, and to produce the best plays, old and new, the shareholders'
subscriptions, supplying a financial backbone; and the shareholders
giving to the undertaking their countenance as well as their cash!
And all this under the idiotic idea, that the English theatre is not what
it ought to be. either in the way of art, entertainment, or education;
that it might be made better, but never will be so long as managers
are left to live from hand to mouth, by catching the crowd, and going
ever lower and lower to catch it.
Dreams, silly dreams!
JUSTICE HOLDING HER OWN.
AMONG Women's Rights the right to be a magistrate is beginning to
be recognised in the Model Republic. A Lady, by one of the American
papers, is reported to have been appointed a Magistrate, to have taken
her seat upon the Bench, and to have administered justice like a Man.
Admitted to be capable of exercising judicial functions, women have
only to qualify themselves by acquiring the requisite knowledge of law,
for eligibility to discharge the most important, and to preside over the
highest legal tribunals. It may not be long, therefore, ere the
Americans will witness the spectacle of a female Judge, sitting in
a Criminal Court, and trying prisoners. And then perhaps we, follow-
ing in the path of progress, shall abo behold an individual of the softer
sex presiding at the Old Bailey, or in a Crown Court at the Assizes.
My Lady Judge will of course be invested with the ermine, perhaps
specially adorned and decorated according to some pattern described
by Le Follet, or delineated in the Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine.

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS.
RBTURN home. Imagine what it will be. Wife, child in arms, re-
tainers, dogs, all ready to meet me. Picture—Return of the Wanderer.
Reality— Nobody here. Wonder what 's the matter.
Happy ThouffAl.—Rmg bell. No rushing in and saying, "Behold me!"
On the contrary, am kept waiting at the gate, and have to ring twice.
Gardener appears suspiciously. Then a dog barking. Then I am
recognised; but only as if I'd just been round the corner for five
minutes, and had come back again. "Mistress is up in town; will be
down in the evening—to dinner, p'raps; if not, to-morrow." See the
cook. "There ain't no dinner ordered. Sir." Oh, hang it—¿ere is
a welcome to the Weary Traveller! Instant arrangements made for
dinner. Look over the house.
Happy Thought.—Scotland stands where it did.—Shakspeare.
Look over the garden: go all round it. Well, how about the drains?
"Oh, the Inspector of Nuisances' friend's men have been working
here, Sir," says Gardener, wil.h an air of doubt as to the result.
"Well P" I inquire. "Well, Sir, " he replies, "I don't see as they 've
done much good—if you just come round here." I come round, and
am nearly knocked over by an infernal odour which the Inspector of
Nuisances had inspected before I left, and turned over to his friend to
obviate with pipes and bell-traps, and gutters, and ditches, and sinks,
and a disestablishment of pig-styes.
Happy Thought.—What rhymes to "sinks?"
Happy (but angry") Thought.—Send for MR. FBESHLIE, i.e., Inspector's
friend; builder, &c.: "&c." means everything. There's nothing that
MB. FRESHLIE, I find on inquiry, does not profess to do. When once
I get him on to my estate (four acres and a shrubbery of uncertain
tenure) I find from his account that something wants doing in every
direction, and that it all comes in his line of business. Locks, blinds,
chimneys, carpentry, drains, wire-work, gravel paths, stones, cement,
pond cleaning, hedging, ditching, tanks, pumps, in fact he makes no
difficulty about anything at all.
He is a lively, burly, impressive, honest-mannered man, who floors
me with technicalities m the presence of my gardener (who pretends
he understands all about it as well as MR. IMIESIILIE, and follows him
silently, addressing; him with an occasional nod of corroboration) and,
when he answers, in person, my message in the morning, is for taking
up the paths and opening the brick work, and knocking lliix down, and
putting that up in another place by way of a preliminary inquiry into
the state of the case.
Happy T/uniphl.—To say, " But your new drains which you were to
have put in before I left for Aachen "—(Aachen has no effect upon him
whatever)—"when I was so ill"—(he is perfectly undisturbed)—"they"
(the drains) "were to have obviated "—(" obviated" doesn't take him
aback one bit)—" the nuisance. Weren't they?" I put this to him
in a question which he must answer honestly in the affirmative.
He is ready with his reply. "Just so, Sir"—(Gardener puts his arms
akimbo, and watches the case for the defence)—"only you'11 see at
once, Sir, where the mischief is." He appeals to my keen perception in

off the scent, &c.
Happy Thought.—Wish I could be put off the scent.
"Well, Sir." he continues, "if you 'il just step this way "—we step
this way, he, I, and the Gardener, and we find five of FBESHLIE'S men
at work with pickaxes, who, having taken up a lot of tUes in the rear
of the house, are now standing in a trench of their own making.
"Now, Sir, here's the mischief, you see"—he points with a two-foot
rule down into the trench. I look in closely,—gardener also less
closely. I have a sort of idea that they are winking at one another
(Gardener and MR. FBESHLIE) over my back. I am sure the
labourers are grinning: I am at a disadvantage, unless I join them,
and wink too. It occurs to me now that "winks" rhymes to
"sLiks."
Happy Thought.—Stick obstinately to the fact that the horrid nuisance
which he had professed to remove still exists.
"Well?" I ask.

Happy Thought—1o call out to Housemaid, and ask her. "Tee,"
she answers, "she do sometimes,—she ain't got no other place."
I appeal to MR. FRESHLIE, and say, translating her idiom, " She
hasn't got any other place, you see."

by taking up the tiles on this side, and opening up the yard towards

don't know if they do that, Sir?"
No, I don't. He wants to throw the blame on the servants; if he is

he has opened himself)—" and run a drain right away off towards the

Happy Thought.—A good job for him.
Happy Thought.—To ask the Gardener, as a witness on my side,
does he think that if this—(" this" means whatever MR. FRESHLIE
has been talking about)—is done, we shan't be bothered any more with
the nuisance P
Happy Thought,—i. e. with MR. FBESHLIB and his bill.
Gardener says, "Yes, he thinks that '11 be all right ; " but he doesn't
commit himself more decidedly.
When FBIDOLINE arrives next day, she complains of there being
nothing but nasty men digging, and sawing, and hammering, about
the place. I point out that it is for sanitary reasons. Then she
returns, "What was the good of your going to Aix?"
Happy Thought.—Drop the subject.
DURHAM GEESE AND DONKEYS.
THOUGH Durham is famed for its mustard, the Durhamites are not
all mustard-mongers. Part of them have no business of their own to
mind, and these, or some of them, have been corresponding in the
South Durham Mercury on the query whether MR. CABLYLE is a Pan-
theist. A Mu. J. G. DOUGLAS, of Hartlepool, no doubt with the
object of getting MB. CABLYLE to shut simpletons up, wrote to him,
putting the unreserved, but, under the circumstances, doubtless not
impertinent question, Are you a Pantheist?" MB. CARLYLE,
replied in a note, "No, never was; nor a Poi-theist either :" and he
might have referred the Durham geese to his collocation of " the beer-
pot and the Devil." But some blades are not sharp enough to draw
even the plainest inference.
Who knows not great PAH is dead, may not know QUEEN ANNE is
dead. Such may be the case of the Durhamites, who have been imput-
ing Pantheism to MB. CARLYLE. But what could have put the idea of
his Pantheism into their heads P Perhaps some avowal which he may
have made of a partiality for Pancakes; possibly some report that he
is accustomed religiously to eat them on Shrove Tuesday. In that
case Pancakes have occasioned a lot of pudding-headed people to fritter
away their time.
The only particular persuasion to which a bias is betrayed in any of
THOMAS OF CHELSEA s writings is that of Hero-Worship, and it is a
wonder that the Durham wiseacres had not so much more wisdom than
acreage as to call him a Herolater. Perhaps the noodles by whom he
has been called a Pantheist are themselves "Pantilers."
All's Well that Ends Well.
GBEAT satisfaction was felt at the final announcement, looked for
with some anxiety, that the LORD AI л YOU ¡could attend the ceremony
of opening Kingston Bridge free of toll, the difference between his
Lordship and the Municipal authorities of that town, whatever it waa,
having happily been bridged over.
Safety Traína.
IT turns out to be untrue that a train conveying the PRINCE and
PRINCESS OP WALES the other day narrowly escaped a collision. No
accident ever does occur to a Royal Train, because proper precautions
are always taken that none shall. It is kberal of Railway Companies
not to charge ordinary passengers by Royal Trains extra for safety.

And there was ¿ILL GLADSTONE a feednn his swine.

"Them there precious pigs." sa^s BILL GLADSTONE, says he,
"Them riotous hogs, they be Irish, they be."
Says I, "What peryuss pigs in Ireland is bred!

TOBACCO FOR TIPPERARY.
AMONO the various questions lately asked of Government in the
House of Commons, one was a sensible one. COLONEL FRENCH
inquired of the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER "whether he would
permit on any, and on what terms, the cultivation of tobacco in
Ireland." Either it would or would not pay to grow tobacco in Ire-
land. If it would not pay, tobacco would not be grown; if it would
pay, the freedom to grow it would be a real emancipation and matter
of justice to Ireland.
Perhaps we may yet lire to smoke Enniskillen Shag, Trim Bird's
Eye, and Wexford Returns, or, instead of foreign cigars, solace our
nervous system with Waterford Regalias, Cork Principes, Wicklow
Pickwicks, and Gcvernment Galway Cheroots. It would be a good
job if, by permitting the growth of Irish tobacco, the Legislature
caused the fire of Irish sedition to eud in smoke.

SURELY nobody who reads this scrap of scientific news

enlightenment :—
"THE DIASCOPB.—DR. MILIO, a Rueeian Suigeon, has in-
vented a means of illuminating the interior of the living human
body, with the aid of a concentrated beam of electric light."
If this be really feasible, we may hope that the invention
may lead not merely to medical but moral good resulte.
Besides assisting in the diagnosis of disease, the diascope
may aid in the detection of ill feelings, and bad workings
of the brain, and powerfully help to check them in their
course. The simple fact that men, by means of its enlight-
ening, may easily be seen through, will deter them from,
pretences that will not bear the lieht. A rogue with a
black heart will in future not be able to hide it from the
world by a fair show of outward seeming; and the danger
of detection will most probably impel him to keep it in
restraint. Knowing that the diascope may render him
transparent, the snob may shrink from shamming, and the
swindler from deceit; while the densest human body—for
instance, say a vestry or a board of parish guardians—may
be actually numbered with the illuminati, and may testify
some presence of enlightenment of brain.

[APRIL 2, 1870.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SUFFRAGE FOR BOTH SEXES.
ПЕ law which allows
every male fool, not
absolutely idiotic or
insane, to vote for
Members of Parlia-
ment, and forbids the
very cleverest and best
educated woman, is
clearly no specimen of
the perfection of hu-
man reason. Probably
MRS. FAWCBTT had
little trouble in de-
monstrating its un-
wisdom in her lecture
delivered at the Brigh-
ton Town Hall, the
other nicht, on the
electoral disabilities of
women. The removal
of those disabilities
has been objected to
as likely to introduce
discord into families;
but, as MRS. FAWCETT
observed :—
"The political inde-
pendence of women
would hare я similar
effect to that produced
b v the recognition of the
right of women to think
for themselves on reli-
gious subjects—persons
of similar politics would
marry, and domestic har-
mony would be rather
increased than lessened.''
This is true; and mutual endeavours to ascertain political views would im-
prove the conversation of partners in a waltz for example, and so tend to social
advancement. The sphere of matrimonial advertising would be enlarged by female
suffrage. We should have gentlemen inclined to matrimony notify ing that they
desire to meet ladies of congenial politics; or sometimes, even, of opposite. A
Liberal gentleman, delighting in controversy, would perhaps announce that he
wanted a Conservative wife, in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of
discussion.
Bat if married women are to vote, the Ballot will be indispensable. The ruf-
fians accustomed to beat their wires are not incapacitated by their brutality from
voting; and they would coerce them by intimidation. The ladies of the higher
classes would, doubtless, many of them be bribed by their husbands in all manner
of ways, and often in the most unblushing manner, unless we adopted the systerr.
of secret voting.
INVOLUNTARY OWLS.
"THEY say the owl was a baker's daughter." Why, pretty Ophelia? Bakers
are supposed, in your day, to have gone to bed betimes, and risen with the lark,
or a little after. Now, indeed, their habits are nocturnal; but the baker is a
bird of night not by nature ana choice, but against both. In London he gene-
rally works from eleven at night till four in the morning. He does not like
this night-work; he wants it abolished, and, in furtherance of the movement for
its abolition, a crowded meeting of journeymen bakers, including also several
master bakers and foremen, was held the other evening at Bryanston Hall, Orchard
Street, Portman Square. Let us hope that, by the amicable co-operation of men
and mästen, the hours of bakers' work will be reduced to twelve instead of from
sixteen to twenty-two out of the twenty-four, and that those twelve will end by
healthy bed-time.
At this pis to rial meeting MR. CARRINGTON moved the following resolution :—
"That this Heeling pledgee itself to support the committee to the utmost of its power in
their endeavour to obtain the insertion of a clause in the Bakehouse Begulation Act, com-
pelling the closing of all bakehouses where bread is manufactured between the hours of
10 p.if. and 4 A.M., and that this meeting further pledges itself to continue agitation in
the trade until an improvement takes place in the social position of our trade."
All just and humane persons must approve of every word of this resolution;
and it contains one word in particular which must, to all bread-eaters whom
rumour may have possessed with misgivings as to the economy of bakehouse
labour, prove reassuring. That is the word manufactured. As Justin Shallow
would say. "Manufactured !—it comes of manui and Jacio: very good." Many
of you will doubtless, knowing that bread cannot be kneaded by machinery, feel
relieved by the information that bakers' bread is made by hand.
AQUATIC SPOKTS,—A Mill-Race.
CORONATION IN FEANCE.
THE Prince, who men expects to rule
With autocratic nod,
Must absolutely be a fool,
He being not a god.
No thunder at Rebellion launch
The mightiest СЛ;ЗАК can,
Save whilst an army, strong and stanch,
Obeys that mortal man.
Society must needs be saved;
It feared the Spectre Red:
And soldiers, who for glory craved,
Had hopes they should be fed.
Then was the First NAPOLEON'S name,
To çovern with, a spell.
Imperial ( ' r.s \ к played his game,
And, truly, played it well.
High-handed long was CESAR'S reign;
No question would he brook;
The shortest way, by might and main,
He with gainsayers took;
Somewhat the worse, meanwhile, for France,
Who, being trammelled so,
Did, save in riches, not advance
As fast as she could go.
Beneath the tutelary yoke,
She, who had passive lam,
At last from lethargy awoke,
And asked her own again.
On CESAR'S legions, who had found
Their glory-dream dispelled,
No confidence could С .i.s.ut ground
His people could be quelled.
Then С I:SA;I took a spacious view;
He granted their demands,
And liberty, in season due,
Restored with open hands.
For common sense o'er CESAR'S acts
Extensively presides •
He goes where Logic, force of facts
Inexorable, guides.
Long life to CAESAR, who his throne
Doth, as his saddle, sit
To manage Frenchmen he alone
As yet has had the wit.
At last he does what he was bound,
By plighted word, to do.
And now the edifice is crowned,
Perhaps he '11 be so too.
GENERAL SHAM.
THE Pontifical troops have been having a grand sham-
fight, the sham manœuvres of which were directed by a
sham-General KAHZLER, ennobled by a sham-title taken
from the sham-victory of Mentana, who was accompanied
by the sham-Dukes of Modena, Tuscany, and Parma, and
the sham-Princes of the sham-kingdom of Naples. The
POPE went to see the sham-manoeuvres of his sham-
army, and was received with great sham-enthusiasm.
The only thing not sham about the whole affair is the
contempt it provokes. When the Papal army is taken in
hand it is not for shampooing, but real pooh-poohing.
Can it be possible that the ecclesiastical manœuvres
now being carried on in the (Ecumenical Council are only
a case of snam-fight too f

VOTING BY MACHINERY.
AH exquisite piece of mechanism is now on view at MBSSIIS. BLACK,
BEANS, & Co., for facilitating vote by ballot.
There is an iron house with several doors. The voter enters.
The door closes behind him by machinery, admitting only one at
a time. All the pros and cons for the different candidates are put
before him, by machinery. The machinery then hands him five or
ten pounds as the case may be, or whatever price he may put
on his vote. After this he is seized, by machinery, and forced to put
his pill into the right hole, that is into the receptacle for which he has
been paid. He is then taken out, by machinery, escapes the hands
of an infuriated, or simply inquisitive, mob, by machinery, goes home,
by machinery, and spends his money like clockwork, ana lives happily
ever afterwards—by machinery.
On hearing of this novel invention the Waxwork Gentlemen residing
at МАЙАМИ TUSSAUD'S boarding-house, Baker Street, have, to a figure
(which they have named, not a high one) applied to be admitted to the
privilege of electors.
There are some difficulties to be got over, but CROMWELL, M.P., and
MR. COBBETT have, we hear, formed themselves into a Committee with
CRAXMRR, the EARL ог WARWICK, and PAUL PRY. who will hold a
responsible office as Government Inspector of Ballot Boxes.
The EARL or WARWICK, the King-Maker, has at the outset, had
some difficulty with GUIDO FAWKES on account of the latter retorting
rather tartly upon the noble Earl with the taunt, "Here 's another
GUT." MB. ОВШАЫЯ, however, was luckily on the spot to say,
"Here we are again !" and to hint at the proximity of a policeman.
All was quiet when our parcel left. Luckily the Sleeping Beauty
had not been aroused from her slumber, though one point in the
debate was the suggestion of offering the Government the Beauty's
interior works for the construction of an efficient Balloting machine.

FRENCH JUDICIAL FARCE:
TEE trial of PETER BONAPARTE has been as good as a play; or at
least as good as a farce. Por there is a distinction between a farce and
a play. "Where," asks MACFLECKNOE, " was it that JONSON sold
certain commodities :—
"Promised a play, and dwindled to a faroo?"
The following portion of a scene in the judicial process above referred
to will be considered, by every competent critic, to surpass the most
farcical row that ever raised screams in an Adelphi " screamer :"—
"GENERAL PI.OMHAI.V (witness) asked what would hare been said in France
if the cousin of the President of the Republic had been killed by the Arabe?
"M л mu: 1, м-un-u (counsel) replied that it would have been said that he
did hi« duty bravely. (Sensation in Court.)
"The I'm SOP. (prisoner) here observed that GENERAL PLOUBAIN had more
courage than the faction to which the advocates belonged. This remark
excited mingled murmura and applause."
"Thereupon MAITRE LAURIER complained of being insulted by the Prince
without the slightest provocation.
"' You this moment laughed in my face,' replied the prisoner.
"M. DE FONVIELLE (witness for the prosecution) shouted out to the
Prince from the further end of the LVmt, 'You basely assassinated VICTOE
NOIR/
"Violent protesta and much excitement followed this interruption, and a
passionate altercation arose between different groups in Court, during which
Ы. DE FONVIELLB, surrounded with gendarme*, wag led out, and the Prince
also withdrew.
"The sitting was entirely suspended for some minutes, but the Prince was
afterwards brought in again."
Surely a Prench "Judge and Jury Club," established on a respect-
able footing, would prove a successful speculation. Would it not
answer the purpose of the occasional lessee of St. James's Theatre to
give a series of performances illustrating the administration of justice
as conducted in France? Proceedings such as those of which a
sample is above presented would require only to be faithfully repro-
duced on the stage, without the least exaggeration, to convulse a
British audience, if not with roars, for the audience would be genteel,
with titters of laughter.
The sages of our English Law, some of them, who, notwithstanding
their engagements on the Spring Circuit or elsewhere, have found time
to read the reports of PRINCE BONAPARTE'S trial, are understood to
have been immensely amused by the irregularities which have been
displayed by everybody concerned in it. But one learned Judge, less
jocose than the rest, is said to have been so seriously shocked at the
undignified disorder by which that process has been signalised, that, on
perusing a description of some of it, he nearly fainted.

BLANK VERSE.
WHILE recently perusing LORD LTTTON'S Lost Tales of
ííüetus, I was struck by the ingenious method of novel metres and
blank rhymes (so to speak), which the noble author has therein fanci-
fully invented. Whether or no his Lordship's version has achieved
popularity I am unable to say, bat it strikes me that a fresh lease
might be given to pur old nursery verses, if his novel method were
adopted in forthcoming editions of these evergreen recreations of our
earlier years. The principle is capable of farther development, as for
example in the invention of entirely new metres. At present, however,
I will content myself with two specimens in illustration of my mean-
ing, and should my time and your space permit, I will avail myself of
the opportunity to create, when the labours of adaptation shall have
come to an end.

EGYPTIAN PROGRESS.
MANY people may have imagined that the humbug of political peti-
tioning had been carried to the highest perfection in this country.
But I.IIOSK Egyptian fellahs beat our fellahs hollow.
The Progrès Egyptien, a newspaper—and we believe that Egyptian
progress thus far only exists on paper—reports that a new petition
has lately been hawked through the KHRDIVE'S territories, which has
already received a considerable number of signatures and seals.
People will naturally ask what is the prayer of this " numerously and
influentially signed petition. There s the rub. Nobody can answer
the question. The petition is a blank. When as many signatures are
attached as the paper will carry, the prayer will be put in by the Pasha.

matic control, so much urged by the Pasha, or for the reduction of
taxation and abolition of forced labour, so earnestly prayed for by the
fellahs—none can tell. It is very properly left a blank, presented as a
nonentity, like the subject it relates to—be it the self-government of
Egypt, the freedom of its courts, or the liberties and hopes of its
poor fellahs. Egyptian progress, Egyptian petitions, Egyptian Parlia-
ments, Egyptian privileges, Egyptian process of law, everything Egyp-
tian, in short, but the power, prerogatives, peculations, peccadilloes,
ami profits of the Pasha, are nonentities. The only things not blanks
in that happy land are the pockets of our friend the KHEDIVE—the
Sovereign whom Europe delighteth to honour, and SIR SAMUEL
BAKBK to serve—and whom a lellah-feeuni

RECOGNITION OF GENIUS.
ENGLAND has had some great composers, though this country never
produced a MOZART or a BEETHOVEN, and did not produce but only
nourished HANDEL; but that is something: for there is an element in
his grandest music which it could have, derived only from a genius fed
on the best of beef. It is exlractum carnit idealised; but still cxtractun
camis; sublimated, etherealised extractum carnis bovina. England ha»
had some great composers P Yea, marry, and hath. For, look you,
there are, saith the Post, to be created :—
"NEW MUSICAL KNIGHTS.—There i« a rumour that two popular nompoters
of music are to have the honour of knighthood, viz., MR. HUIM,I:Y It u НАШИ,
the composer of the well-known and popular eong, ' God Bhu the Prina of
Ч"п1,ч," and MR. J. P. CLAHK.K, a military composer, for his new national
chant, 'Hail to the Duke.'"
"Hail to the Duke" may not perhaps be quite comparable to the
"Hailstone Chorus," nor "God Bless the Printe of Wales" to the
"Hallelujah." That loyal anthem and that loyal chant are, however,
compositions which have their merit, and happy man be the dole of
Мл. RICHARDS and MA. CLARKE that it is merit such as to have won
the honour of knighthood. Of course STERNDALE BENNETT will be
offered a Peerage.

Notes o» BouMte» and Olisetiet.—Tha sounds rather frisky tor the
title of a book by a "Lecturer and late Fellow of St. John's College,
Cambridge," ana we should feel easier as to the future of St. John's
if we could receive an assurance from the College authorities that they
have examined the work in question, and can vouch for its being of
the highest respectability.

SURGEON-DENTISTRY IN ST. PANCRAS.
ENDER as are usually the
rump-steaks supplied to
the paupers in St. Paneras
Workhouse, some difficulty
is experienced by many of
the elder inmates of that
asylum in masticating their
meat. Feeling that the
state of their teeth must
require attention, the St.
Faneras Guardians have
determined on appointing
a dentist to afford them
the requisite assistance, by
stopping, or replacement if
necessary.
Candidates for the office
of surgeon-dentist to the
St. Paneras Union, to which
a liberal salary will be
attached, are invited to
send their testimonials and
certificates of qualification
to the Board of Guardians.
The grinders of the aged
poor in the St. Paneras Union will henceforth be ш a great proportion
artificial, and manufactured of porcelain. Applications should be sent
in on the first of April.
VALUATION OF A VETERAN.
A LETTER in the Pott, dated Everdon Hall, Dayentry, and signed
DAVID ST. PAUL, J.P., contains the following statement :—
"JAMES KENNISO, aged 83, infirm, decrepit, half bedridden, and gutters
greatly in the head. Served in the 40th Foot, and Ьш я pension of 9d. per
day (•>.«. 3d. »-week). Has a medal with fire clasps for Orthes, Ñire, Nivelle,
Pyrenees, Tittoria, and a medal for Waterloo; was severely wounded in the
left eide and left leg and aleo in the head at Badajos. Still Buffers from the
last wound."
Ninepence a day is what a grateful country thinks of this veteran's
worth and wounds. Munificent reward of valour! generous en-
couragement to brave death or mutilation in fighting your country's
battles, my boys! JAMES KENNING'S country, however, is poor. It
cannot afford to keep the old hero quite from the pariah, and as for the
parish, ST. PAUL (J.P.) in continuation states that :—
"Not long ago thi« old soldier was very ill and sinking. The medical man
of this division of the Daventry Union ordered him two pounds of meat
a-week. Refused by the Daventry Board of Guardians."
Of course. JAMES KENNING'S parish is still poorer than his country.
The guardians of the Daveutry Union, therefore, are bound not (and
they are probably not the men) to let any medical man " come the old
soldier" over them, how old and how meritorious soever the soldier
may be, by ordering him two pounds of meat a week. What, two
pounds of meat! Two pounds m one week for an old soldier! Why,
it is almost as much as a dog need eat in a day. And then very likely
the man's meat would be dearer than the dog's meat. Two pounds in
seven days, at perhaps eightpence a pound, would be It. 4rf. a-week.
A man of eighty-three might live to be ninety-three; there is at least
one man living who is ninety-four: and the amount which the old
soldier's two pounds a-week at the possible rate of eightpence per
pound would cost the Union in ten years is too frightful to calculate.
A retiring pension of ninepence a-day is as bountiful a provision for
old age as any private soldier can reasonably expect. Why, it is three-
pence more than an officer would pay for a good cigar! If such prizes
will not induce the populace to enter the Army, we must resort to the
Conscription.

THE SUNDAY INFOEMEE'S SATUEDAY NIGHT.
(4fl«r BURNS.)
"A person described as a gentleman, and at whose instance many tradesmen
of Westbourne Grove and Paddington have been summoned for serving on the
Lord's Day, was charged with wilfully breaking a square of glass in a cab.
"The evidence of the cabman was that on Saturday night he was proceed-
ing with his four-wheeled cab, having a lady and gentleman iuside. As they
were proceeding along the Edgwure Hoad the prisoner struck the glass and
broke it. As he at first would not give any name or address, he gave him in
charge.
"The constable who took him said, in answer to the Magistrate, he thought
the prisoner was under the influence of drink.
"Prûoner denied this, and said he was excited; and his witness also
asserted the same, but admitted that they had taken two or three drops of
whiskey.
"Мв. D'Ev.M nrui discharged the prisoner."
THE wind of March " blaws loud wi' angry sugh,"
Deepening the tints of e'en that "jolly nose,"
Whose owner, warm'd with nippers not a few,
Up Edgware Koad circuitqusly goes:
Still at each pub the Mountain Dew he stows,
Till by potations frequent render'd brisk, he
With spiritual ardour overflows
(Gentiles sar "spirituous," suggesting whisky);
One thing, at least, is sure—the Saint got very frisky.
He quite forgot that Sabbath eve his plan
For summoning next day some tradesman dreary,
Some widow poor, or heathen barrow-man,
Whom he had muant to niake cry "Miserere!"
In fact his saintship waxed exceeding beery;
Until his pious speech he fairly hashed it,
Avow'd himself a cove all chick-a-leary,
And, when he ran against a post, d—dashed it;
And falling foul at last of a cab-window, smashed it.
The carnal cabman, filled with worldly wrath,
Addressed his holiness in strongish Saxon.
The peelers, seeing that upon the path
He stood by no means like a " Stonewall" Jackson,
His pious ardours kid their mundane tax on;
And, seating him, for safety, in the road,
Prepared at length his pate to hit hard whacks on,
Then, failing to find out his " blest abode,"
Lugged e'en his unctuous self off to their common quod.
That Sabbath-day in the tobacco-shops
And penny ice-saloons reigned glee and laughter,
Whilst their informer in retirement stops
Tasting the horrors of his "morning after."
Next morn, D'JiÏNCOUK.T (was ever sentence dafter !)
Rebuking those who dared this Saint to grieve—
This pillar of the Church—in fact this rafter-
Allowed his saintliness, unscathed, to leave
And, pottle-deep, renew his draughts next Sabbath-eve.
О Scotia, thus thy pions sons, they say,
Of " sweet religion" make a mere rhapsody,"
Killing the tedium of their Sabbath Day
With copious and clandestine draughts of toddy.
So veils a sinful soul a formal body,
Laying on all but its own sins the lash:
The saintly robe shows as the vilest "shoddy,"
Tricking poor fools with hypocritic trash.
And knaves who dwell in glass dare others panes to smash.
Self-lffeaeurement.
A WOMAN was charged at the Westminster Police Court with
throwing dirty water over the Corporal of a guard of Coldstreams who
were searching her house for an absentee.
MR. SK.I.FK said "that, became the complainant wo» a Coldslream, it
teas not to be tolerated that a cold stream should be thrown over him!
This we believe to be the most striking example of Self-debasement ou
record.
Pacification for Patland.
IT is a mistake to suppose that Ireland will ever be satisfied with
any measure of mere justice. What Irishmen want is not justice but
generosity. There ought to be an Irish líate, levied on all the property
of Great Britain, for a subsidy to Ireland, paid annually and punctually.
Then Ireland would probably be tranquillised. and remain quiet, if the
subsidy were to be stopped the moment the Irish began to be trouble-
some.

message handed in blocks the messages following it, it is extremely
desirable that none but messages on urgent business, or on matters of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LESSON TO LOUIS BLANC.
(From Punch't own Correspondence.)
MY DEAK LOUIS BLANC,
I WAS getting to have a high respect for your candour,
snanrit.y, and sound sense in political matters. I thought experience
of English politics, and observation of English peculiarities, had so
tempered your democratic doctrinaireism with discretion, that your
letters to the Temp» might be looked to as about the best comments on
English affairs for the guidance of jour numerous French readers that
had ever been suggested to a French head, or found expression from a
Trench pen. But your letter on the Peace Preservation Bill has sadly
disappointed—or, shall 1 say, rudely undeceived F—me. Tou tear your
hair, and break out, into wailing over the Bill: see in it a falling oil'
from Liberal faith, and a dereliction of Liberal daty. "It breaks yonr
heart"—" It puts Ireland in a state of siege"—" It drives you to one
of two conclusions—either the reforms effected or promised are not
such as the evil to be remedied required, or Ireland is irreconcile-
able." ....
Mon cher LOUIS, is it possible that you really feel yourself on the
horns of this dilemma? Are yon not, half unconsciously, falling
hack, into your old doctrinaire frame of mind, and ignoring realities
because they jar with a compact and convenient formula?
¡ Do you not see that the notorious end obviou» facts of this caae
point neither to the one of your conclusions nor the other, but to a
third, which you omit altogether; namely, that Ireland is suffering
under the disease of lawlessness, engendered by many c*n»es, but. just
now brought to a head by the combined aggravations of Fenianiam, a
dishonest, disloyal, and dangerous Press, Secret Societies, old delu-
sions and bitter memories, and some ill-timed acts of bad landlordism,
met by triumphant resistance to the law, arrayed, unhappily, for the
moment—as it has too often been in Ireland, bat is less likely to be,
henceforth—on the side of greed and cruelty P
As the Church and Land Bills are meant to dissever the law from
such unnatural allies as sectarian ascendency and lust of greed, the
Peace Preservation Bill is meant to put down such enemies of Ireland
as Fenianism, a seditious and anarchic Press, Ribbonism and its
secret war on life and property—and thus to give the Reforms which
the Irish Church and Irish Land Bills planted, time to take root and
grow and bear fruit—which they are not likely to do, my dear Loms,
m a day or a year: it is only French trees of liberty that are planted in
that hope. It, is meant to secure life and property against the forces
of evil combined for war against both, and against the peace and
prosperity of Ireland which are bound up with them.
Is it really possible, my dear Louis, that you do not see this f Entre
nous, I have too much respect for you not to conclude that you do see
it as plainly as I do; but that to own it might involve you in some
awkward admissions, and awaken some disagreeable recollections.
The Peace Preservation Bill does not put a single restriction on lawful
liberty. There is one way in which every county in Ireland may
exempt itself from its restrictions of individual freedom—by abstaining
from outrages on life and property. There is one way in which every
newspaper in Ireland may laugh at its provisions against the Press—
by not talking treason, sowing sedition, and hounding on a passionate
public to defiance of the law and hostility of class and race.
Let me ask you. Have you read the articles in the so-called
"National" Irish newspapers r Can you honestly say, or think, that
national liberty will suffer, national life be touched, national self-respect
outraged, national prosperity impaired, by the sternest and most sudden
suppression of their unceasing incentives to civil war, their weekly
invitations to a general upsetting of society, and a carnival of violence
and outrage? I cannot pay you the ill-compliment of supposing that,
having read these papers, and watched what has been going on in
Ireland for the last six months, you can seriously think of comparing
Ms. GLADSTONE'S Peace Preservation Act with Louis NAPOLEON'S
law of public safety, or likening its Press provisions to those in force
under the French Empire, as it was.
No. The Peace Preservation Act neither proves that the Irish
Church Bill and the Irish Land Bill were mistakes, nor that the Irish
people are irreconcileable. It but proves that there are wolves in
Ireland, and that we mean to muzzle them—even though they call
themselves wolf-hounds; that there are writers who have drawn their
nourishment from the social and political sores of Ireland, as blow-flies
and maggots wax fat upon corruption; and that we will no longer
allow them to keep these sores open for the sake of their impure and
ignoble subsistence, to the irritation, first, and ultimately the ex-
haustion of the sufferer whose decay they batten on.
One word, by the way, of answer to those who, like the Spectator
last week, and a correspondent of the Spectator this week, accuse me
of recklessly sowing ill-will between England and Ireland, by such
cartoons as my late one, called " The Irish Tempest," in which, they
seem to assume that Ireland is embodied as Caliban. Do not these
critics see that Ireland is there personified, not as Caliban, but as
Miranda f That what Caliban personifies are the brutal disturbers of
Ireland's peace, and the unreasoning underminers of Ireland's pro-
sperity; the men who blow the blast of civil war in the Irishman and
its kindred prints; the skulking rascals who write threatening letters,
"tumble" landlords, and beat out tenants' brains, and occasionally
hamstring cows, or cut off their owners' noses F
In Ireland, as elsewhere, England has faith in Justice, and looks for
her ultimate victory always and everywhere. She fervently hopes for
the reign of Love even where the Nemesis of Hate has long ruled;
and she trusts to the coming of Prosperity when her way has been
Erepared by Order. But she knows no such enemy to justice as
iwlessness, no such deadly foe to love as hate, no such obstacles to
order and prosperity as discontent, disloyalty, and terror. That
justice, love, order, and prosperity may have time and opportunity
to establish their blessed rule in Ireland, England is determined to
fetter the hands and to silence the tongues and trumpets of lawless-
ness, hate, discontent, disloyalty, and terror — nay, to put strait-waist-
coats, if you prefer that image, on the madmen who would destroy
Ilirir keepers, first, and dash out their own brains afterwards.
That is the eiplanation, my dear LOUIS BLANC, of the Peace Pre-
servation Bill. I recommend it to you as the text of your next letter
to the Temps. Yours very truly,

SOME people blame the Government for its apparent apathy respect-
ing the foul outrages and murders rife in Ireland. The Government
may answer that force has proved a failure¿ that theirs is a pacific and
not repressive policy; that their Church Bill and their Land Bill will
satisfy all claims for justice at our hands; and that these sedatives are
certain, in course of time, to cure. The Government may, doubtless,
have fair grounds for their opinion, but there are some good judges
who differ from such judgment. Among them may be cited LORD
CHIEF JUSTICE WHITESIDE, who, referring to the threatenings, and
pistollings, and riotings so terribly now rife, is reported to have
»aid :—
"If this awful state of things be allowed to continue, if crime goes thus
undetected, the result will be that the people will consider themselves safer
under the protection of these skulking murderers than under that of the law.
If crime go thus unpunished, then the result must be that the arm of the law
will be paralysed, and ite administration impossible."
"Justice for Ireland!" has for long years been the cry, and thanks,
in a great measure, to the energy of the Government, justice in many
ways is surely being done. But there is one way in which justice will
surely not be done, and that is if the power of the law is to be para-
lysed, and the ministering of justice is virtually to cease. If rioters
are to defy the ministers of justice, and assassins go unpunished for
their atrocious crimes, great injustice will be done to all honest folk in
Ireland, who indeed must all live out of it, if they wish to save their
lives.

glad to direct their attention to one means of lightening their anxious
labours. The machine has other uses, which are fairly set forth in a
prospectus, and those who object to cold dinners cannot do better
than procure it.

one reflects that A. stands for Archbishop, B. for Beadle, C. for Canon,

LITERARY ICE-STACKS.
A NEWSPAPER report concerning the University Crews
states that both of them, one day last week, for practice
palled up the river, "regardless of the pitiless pelting of
the storm." and, in particular, that "Oxford rowed up
to Mortlake during a heavy fall of snow." Would it not
be a good plan to cut passing allusions like these to the
inclemency of the season out of the papers, and keep them
to refer to when it i» hot P The notices of "The Weather
and the Parks," which our contemporaries are wont to
publish in the winter months, might in. like manner be re-
served for June, July, and August. Such frigid intelli-
gence would form nice cool Summer reading. It is true
that nobody can "hold a fire in his hand merely "by
thinking upon frosty Caucasus;" but still imagination may
be cooled or warmed by appeals to it suggestive of tem-
perature high or low; imagination accordingly can cool
or warm the frame: and surely reminiscences of ice, snow,
sleel, frost, and cold, bitter easterly and north-easterly
winds would be found rather refreshing in the dog-days.
We have lately been shivering—in two or three months
more we may be perspiring, and then the mental reproduc-
tion of wintry cold, accompanying iced champagne, or
claret-cup, will at least be an aid to refrigeration.

With stores of wealth on either side,

He pulled, to try if it was loose.
I am not of gregarious mould,

SIB,
A FEARFUL RITE AT ROME.
You know that, about the date of the suppression of the
Knights Templars, strange rumours were current of indefinite horrors
supposed to be perpetrated in the secret Chapters held by that myste-
rious brotherhood. Read this telegram from Rome, dated March 22,
being the day after that whereon the POPE had held a secret Consis-
tory:—
"Among the prelates preconieed in the Consistory yesterday were the
ABCHBMHOFS OF ARMAGH and TORONTO, the BISHOPS OF SAVANNAH,
AHMIDALE, and Вт. AUGUSTINE."
Preconised! That word doubtless means something as dreadful as
any one of the ordeals which the members of the Order whose latest
Grand Master was JACQUES DE MOLAI had to undergo at their dark
léaitces. The Holy Father may excommunicate Freemasons, because
they refuse to confess their secret, but they, how closely soever they
may be tiled in their lodges, are none of them ever preconised. Sir, I
should like to have the person of one of these preconised prelates ex-
amined soon after he had undergone the operation of being so served.
I warrant you he would be found to bear a mark worse than that of the
actual cautery merely, not to say red-hot poker. What mark P Sir,
the mark of the Animal To be preconised means to be marked with
that. Ask Dn. GUMMING if it doesn't, unless you are content to take
the word of Yours truly,
Peterborough, All Sages' Day. Q. H. W.
Our Emancipated Neighbours.
THE new Senalus Consultum seems to have approximated the French
Senate pretty nearly to our own Upper House of Parliament. His
Majesty the EMPEROK NAPOLEON'S subjects may now almost say, also,
"Thank Heaven we have a House of Lords."
BRAGGARTS AND THEIR MONEYBAGS.
DAHNO from Berlin a Foreign Office-r reports that :—
"A good deal of the present dearnees of living is attributable to the number
of Americans, who are accustomed to the high paper prices of their own
country, and are too apt to observe that everything is very cheap, which
induces shopkeepers to raise their prices accordingly."
Saying to a shopkeeper that his goods are very cheap is another way
of tolling him that you have lots of money, and in fact of boasting idly
of your wealth. Nothing is more snobbish than to brag about the
fulness of one's purse. Men who do so hardly can be said to make an
empty boast, although it is quite true they make an empty-headed one.
It is worse than for a lord to brag about his title, for such a braggart
act can scarcely hurt his neighbours; whereas, by raising prices,
boasters of their riches much injure poorer folk. The game of brag is
popular in the United States, but when played in the above way on.
this side of the Atlantic, it thoroughly deserves to be indicted as a
nuisance.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AWFUL MENACE.
Т и r. UK lins been assessin R of damages in a case of Breach of Promise
in the north of England—names are no object. Some of the gentle-
man's letters were edifying, though he did not write very good
English. Among his wishes for the welfare of hie (then) beloved is
this :—
"May the sun of glory sliinc around thy bed, and may the gate of honour,
plenty, and happineu for ever be upon thee."
If the «un of glory is very bright, one of CHILD'S Night Lights
might be preferable; and ta to having a gate npon one, that is matter
of taste—we should imitate the pig, which, according to the vnlgar
saying, makes under a gate more noise than aught but two pigs. We
suspect, however, that the ardent party had been transcribing from an
older writer, for, when he becomes natural, mark the transition :—
"EMMA, no one can epeak the lore I bear to you, and I hope you «ill
cherish the same to make us both happy, and I should feel heart broken if
there should be a parting. Brandy and billiards would be my life then."
Brandy, if good, and taken in moderation, is a good familiar crea-
ture, and billiards, played in refined society (best with ladies, in a
country house) may be indulgently spoken of. But the menace, in the
sense of this lover, is truly awful. That he might have the less to
spend in so dreadful a manner, the jury mulcted him in the sum of
£750. By the way, when Women's Eights are obtained, surely these
actions will be abolished—a woman will scorn to ask money for the
loss of such a trumpery thing as a husband. Love has been defined
as an insane desire to maintain somebody else's daughter. We shall
want a new definition.

Only one Roman grieved for him and sorrowed,
'Twas he from whom the noble steed he 'd hired.
In the above example, the poetic reader will observe with notes of
admiration, that instead of letting "think" rhyme with "brink,"
"pit" with "hit," "mind" with "hind." "bird" with "heard,"
"ass" with "class," "borrowed" with л sorrowed," "face" with
"space," the writer has, with deep thought, substituted equivalents
without impairing the sense.
Also observe how commonplace would be the first couplets, if thus
written :—
His jewelled hand he waved proudly;
His neighing steed he cheered loudly;
On the saddle he sat tightly
So! the bridle he grasped lightly.
A NEW WATER-COLOUR EXHIBITION.
WHEN the EMPRESS OP THE FRENCH lately visited the East, many
were the prophecies put forward by the Gobemouehes as to the political
results of ner journey. So far as we can learn, its only consequence at
present has been the introduction of a colour for a ball-dress, which is
thus described by a fashionable pen : —
_" The new colour, Eau de Nil, is a delicate mixture of grey and green, ehot
with silver, во that at every movement of the body to give the lobe the aspect
of flowing water."
This may be a cool and pleasant aspect for the summer, but for
winter time we hardly can imagine it agreeable. Indeed, with the ex-
perience which we have had since Christmas, were we to notice in our
drawing-room the aspect of flowing water, our first impression would
be that the pipes again had burst. Assuredly we should expect to
look the picture of despair, if we were present at such a water-colour
exhibition.
Indiscriminate Humanity.
So the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has pounced
upon the Islington Bull-fighters, summoned them before a Magistrate,
had them fined, and stopped their entertainments. From Islington to
Wormholt Scrubbs is not far, and it is much to be feared by the tame
pigeon shooting nobility and gentry that the officers of an impartial
Association, vigilant to protect poor animals from cruelty, will as soon
as possible be likewise down upon the Gun Club.
PUNCH'S SECOND COLUMN.

TX7IDDLES.—Stay away by all means, and the longer tho better.
ABSENTEE.—If you knew how well we get on without you, we foar
you would come back, out of spite.
PAUL.—Please yourself. VIRGINIA has made other arrangements,
and will be married in three weeks. "A Cottage near a wood'' ie
poetical, but a villa in St. John's Wood has practical advantages. To show
that she bears no ill-will towards you, any becoming wedding-present will be
accepted. But don't send a butter-dish, or Tapper.
TO LUCINDA.—You would not look, though I occupied the stall I
mentioned, and you condemned me to sit out the whole of the piece, in
the hope that you would relent. Surely you owe me compensation. Make
your papa take you to Sir George ana a Dragon, next Tuesday, and when
the Bull-fight comes, think of and look at him to whom you vowed faith at
Cowes.
SAILING JAMES,—All is well. The hitherto obdurate menial
listens to the voice of the charmer, and informe us that the family will
be out at a ball on Wednesday. We shall therefore honour the premises with
a visit at 11.30 P.M., and as we shall not adopt the war-medal plan, but shall
divide the silver among those only who were present at the action, you had
better be punctual. Bring your own jemmy and life-preserver. Bog will be
dosed, as yon are nervous.
EXPECTING PETER.—The only information which has yet been
JDj obtained ie that the party's name is SMITH, and that he lives somewhere
in Yorkshire. If you wish a messenger to be sent into that county to follow
up this clue, remit funds.
AVARUS.—Why will you be so obstinate? Every one is against you.
Why should you make a will? It is only giving money to a lawyer,
and whatever you may do, the family has resolved to contest the document.
Tour course is clear. Beturn to town, divide your money equally among your
cousins, and trust to their affection to render the evening of your life as
pleasant as is possible in the case of a person of your unfortunate disposition.
Or they will unite to pension you, in moderation, if your detestable temper
prefer solitude in a remote cottage. Why will you be deaf to the voice of
consanguinity?
A**** B*** *.—Dearest Papa, forgive mo—forgive us. Con-
vinced that aristocracy is not an institution to be encouraged, I rejected
LORD MOSBTOWERS, and equally convinced that woman needs a conductor, I
have married the conductor of the Hercules omnibus by which you used to go
into town. You know, dear, you have often commended his clean appearance
and civility, and indeed you first drew my attention to him. The match is
your own making, bless it, and also your affectionate POLLY.
MARIA JANE.—You saw that tho pew-opener, though she had re-
ceived a shilling, avoided putting me into your pew, and placed me in
front, ao that I could not even see you. I am convinced, from the old crea-
ture's manner of looking at me, that she had been tampered with. I have a
great mind to write to the Bishop, who would remember my name from
having so frequently flogged me when he was the head of • • * * * school. Has
our secret been betrayed: I do not like to speak harshly of your father, but
his gaze, as I passed, discomfited, was stony and offensive. Your mother
affected to be looking out a hymn. Your sisters evidently sniggered. I will
(for the present) keep my hands off your arrogant brother. Next Sunday I
repeat the experiment, and with half-a-crown. If I fail, Convocation shall hear
of it? Am I to be mocked in church ?—ORLANDO FURIOSO.
MYSTERIOUS CHARLES.—Of course, you gooso, you can go on
advertising, if you like, and do not mind the money, which I mu»t say
I think might be better laid out (•">.',) but it is quite ridiculous, for both papa
and mamma are as ready to welcome you as were the parents of Miss JENNY
HAFFLINS. in the Cotter's Saturday Night. You were introduced at the
South K. 11., and invited to call, llul I suppose you really do not care about
seeing JEMIMA.
TTtTHlSKERANDOS.—Certainly not at the hotel you mention, for
VV reasons which I con explain, and so can the landlord. Walk up and
down the path by the bank, in the opposite meadow, from 1 to 6 P.M. , and if it
rains, get under the first arch of the Dridge. Be careful not to enter any house
whatever, and do not smoke, as that looks profligate. Improve your mind by
admiring the key-stones of the bridge, they were carved by MRS. DAWSON
ÜAMER, & friend of HORACE WALPOLH. If I do not come, return by the last
train, and you will find a letter.—JOHN CUCUMBER.
A NNABEL L .—Return. All has been done to make you happy—
IX. your troublesome brothers have been sent to boarding-school, your nag-
ging sisters are gone to AUNT AGÍTATE at Heme Bay, your parents will give
up their nap after dinner, all the servants have been changed, the dog has
been presented to a friend, a cheval glass has been put into your bed-room,
your dress allowance will be doubled, a pew has been taken at a Ritualist
church, there is a new laundress, the tree you disliked has been cut down, you
shall be called to breakfast instead of being summoned by the bell, the
screeching water-cress man has been run over, and your cousin HORACE may
call when he likes. So return to the loved home so long adorned by your
presence, and to be in future, we hope, adorned by your smiles.

PUNCH'S POLICE BEPOBT.
THE RULINQ PASSION.
AN old offender, apparently advanced in yean, small in stature, and
rather shabby in dress, bat of respectable exterior, who gave the name
of JOHN RUSSELL, was brought up before Mr. Punch, charged with
writing letters calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.
FÖRSTER ( W. Б.) was called in support of the charge.
He said there had long been a great deal of trouble and disturbance
on his beat, owing to an old quarrel between two neighbours, of the
names of Church and Chapel; that both had large and ill-brought-up
families—ragged, dirty, thieving little rascals, who were allowed to
play in the gutters, and pilfer, and practise pitch-and-toss, and use bad
language to that degree that they were quite a nuisance to the neigh-
bourhood.
The Magistrate asked why the children were not sent to school F
KOUSTEH explained that, ш consequence of the bad blood between
Church and Chapel, neither would allow his children to attend the
school where the others' children went; and that this was one of the
chief causes of the rows between the two. He had been directed by
his superior officers to see if he couldn't put a stop to these quarrels,
and get the children put to school. The prisoner RUSSELL had formerly
taken much interest ш the matter, and had written a letter suggesting
a way of arranging the school difficulty, which seemed to him (FÖRSTER)
an excellent one. He had lately proposed it to both Church and
Chapel, when both seemed satisfied, and agreed that their children
should be put to the same school, and be properly taught and taken care
of, so that he really thought the troubles between the two households
were at an end. But one morning, last week, he found Church and
Chapel cuffing each other, and calling each other names as bad as ever.
He found that some of Chapel's friends had been working on him not
to make it up with Church. But. besides that, he found the prisoner—
who was looked upon as a very clever fellow by a good many people in
the neighbourhood—had been writing a letter to Chapel, telling him
if he were Chapel he wouldn't stand Church's cheek, and that it would
be better the children should go without schooling another twelvemonth
than be put to school in the way he (FÖRSTER) had proposed. As the
plan he had proposed was RUSSELL'S own, naturally, he (FÖRSTER)
felt very much taken aback. Had no doubt expressed his feelings to
that effect, and thought anybody would, under the circumstances. Had
heard it said that RUSSELL wanted to keep the neighbourhood in hot
water, that he might bring his own name before the public. Must say
he ( FÖRSTER) did not believe thia. RUSSELL was rather a fussy, meddle-
some person, but he believed he meant well. It was an unfortunate
way he had. He (RUSSELL) never could be made to understand how
much mischief he might do by thrusting himself into family quarrels.
He had all his life been in the habit of writing letters of this kind,
and had set people by the ears again and again, and got into trouble
himself through them. The Commissioners did not press for a heavy
punishment. They believed a reprimand would be sufficient, and a
caution not to do it again.
The worthy Magistrate observed to the prisoner that he was old
enough to know better; and that it was a wonder he had not been
taught, by his many previous warnings, the harm likely to be done by
his mischievous trick of writing aggravating letters.
The Prisoner said he had always meant everything for the best,
including all the letters he had ever written.
The worthy Magistrate observed, that if good intentions were
accepted as a plea, a vast deal of the greatest mischief in the world
would go unpunished. He would bind the prisoner over in two sub-
stantial securities to keep the peace, with his pen, for the rest of hie
natural life.
WAITING AN ANSWER.
MR. PUNCH,
I AM bewildered, lost. Perhaps you can guide me out of the
wood. What is "atime-table conscience-clause"? Is it amachine,
or an instrument, or a document? Can it be bought? Where can it
be seen and consulted P Is it a patent invention, and costly, and for
how long is it warranted to act? And can anybody procure it whose
conscience is out of order, and wants regulating? These new-fangled
terms are most perplexing to old-fashioned folks like myself: and any
clue that you can give me to the meaning of my present educational
puzzle will be thankfully taken hold of by д^ QLI)
Justice for Justice.
A CONTEMPORARY states that the POPE'S pedigree has lately been
examined, and that his Holiness U shown to be of Hebrew descent.
This, were the story true, would certainly add to the (Eeumenicalism
of the Council, besides strengthening his connection with a certain
PETER. But we believe the good old pastor to be a real Christian,
and if we complain of him, it is because lie will not let his Council do
a Protestant the same justice. Why were the bishops allowed to hoot
down the men who protested in our behalf P

FISH NIPPED IN THE SPAWN.

HE FiMrtf Gazette, describing the great waste of fish that goee on
through the captare of such as are immature, or with roe, observes, for
instance that :—
"The demand upon lobsters is so enormous, th»t however they continue to
exist is indeed a wonder. There it not a day in the year but what a spawning fi«h
ie in request, for every purchaser of a trumpery two-shilling brill muet swallow a
thousand or two of lobsters in the shape of spawn, to get it down, without onu
thought of the harm he is perpetuating to future generation«."
One particular phrase in the extract above quoted is a striking illus-
tration of the consequence of wasting fish. A fish costing more than
many a working man's whole day's wages is spoken of as a trumpery
two-shilling brill." Oysters have already come to be esculent money;
some twopence a gulp: and all fish, as well as all flesh, is rising out of
most people's reach. What with the waste of fish, and also of fuel, namely
coals, without which neither fish nor flesh can be cooked, we are likely,
by-and-by, to find our fare reduced to a pretty kettle of fish, and a pot
which there is no boiling.
FIRST-NIGHT A1ÏD OTHER DRAMATIC CRITICISMS.
(From Punch's oten Correspondence.)
TO H. J. BYRON.
Ml DEAR CONÏBÊRE,
"CKÏDÏ BYRON" is, I believe, your family motto. If cuique
in sud arle credendvm est be a true principle, there is nobody who has
more riitht to be trusted than you, on a question of the dramatic art as
it is. For where shall I find a more indefatigable or more successful
caterer for the table at present spread for the British play-going public F—
not always the best served,—as must be owned, entre nous,—either by
its butchers or its cooks, its butlers or its bakers, its carvers or its con-
fectioners.
But my object just now is not to criticise the quality of the dishes
provided by you or me, or our brother purveyors for the theatre. I
wish to exchange thoughts with you apropos of some late letters of
yours to the Daily Telegraph on the subject of First-Night Criticism.
You contend—I refer to your letters from memory, and without pre-
tending to literal exactness in my references—that judgment ought not
in fairness to be passed on pieces on the night of their production,
inasmuch as in first performances hitches, delays, and shortcomings
are unavoidable, which are likely to prejudice the critic, and lead him
to impute to the piece defects really due to imperfectness of preparation
or incompleteness of performance.
Now, as a brother dramatic author, I feel all the hardship of this
danger and its consequences. I have had too many pieces risked or
wrecked on their first night by the shabbiness of appointments, the
slicking of flats, the slowness of sets and shifts, the imperfectness of
some of my actors, the incapacity of others, the general hesitation or
awkwardness of the stage-business, the want of judicious compression
here, of needful explanation there—all defects which should have been
cured or prevented in the course of rehearsal—not to feel the cruelty
of condemning the play, when the failure, fairly judged, is not the
author's but the management's. In a word, I have continually seen a
hastily and half-cooked dish presented to the public when it expected,
and had a right to expect, a carefully and thoroughly prepared one—
and have suffered thereby in temper always, and, too often, in the effect
of such bungling and blundering on the run and reputation of my piece,
and, as a consequence, on the pleasure of the public and the profit of
the author.
The hardship I admit as fully as you do yourself. But I do not go
along with you in the suggestion of a remedy. Instead of requesting
the critics to abstain from first-nijtht criticism, I would rather be dis-
posed to beg of them to make their censure, whether of the first or any
other night, more searching and severe. I would ask them to be stern
where they are now, as a rule, lenient tc every one concerned but the
author—to be less blind to short-comings, and more severe on blun-
dering and bungling than they usually are at present in the rare cases
in which they venture to blame manager or actor. Even if they impair
or blight the prospects of a piece, by their detection and denunciation
of defects which care and preparation might have cured or prevented,
still I say they are but doing their duty by the public, the actors, the
authors and Ike managers.
It is the want of an ever present sense of the critical eye being upon
the stage that has bred nine-tenths of the carelessness and slovenliness
of first-night performances in this country, has gone far to degrade pur
theatres into the ill-governed, slatternly, and ill-mannered establish-
ments they are, and has destroyed in most managers and actors alike
the very notion of that careful and thorough rehearsal, which gives
French plays so much of their completeness and finish.
iou are actor now as well as author, and you may be looking at the
matter, perhaps, more from the actor's point of view than the author's.
But as an author, depend upon it your prayer should be for sterner
and more watchful criticism, as your best friend in the long run, how-
ever hard it hit you for the moment.
It is for critics to enforce on managers the duty of showing due
respect for their art and for the public, both of which are outraged
whenever a piece is produced without thorough rehearsal; whenever
actors are allowed to slur or stumble over dialogue, without due em-
phasis, and correct elocution, or even coherent and correct adherence
to the text; whenever scenery is allowed to stick or stage-business to
halt or hobble.
Till critics have made themselves formidable to managers as judges
to be satisfied not propitiated, managers will not be frightened into
better behaviour, in this all-important matter of rehearsal and prepa-
ration. Till they are made to feel that imperfection and slovenliness
are certain to draw down sure and summary condemnation and its
legitimate consequences in "shy" houses, we authors will continue
to suffer from imperfect and slovenly dealing with our work. We are
heavier sufferers from the sin, if possible, than the public; and should
be even more grateful for whatever refines and raises the usage of the
English theatre as regards thoroughness of rehearsal. Whatever
forces the managers to do us and their art more justice is a boon and a
blessing first of all to «г. And among the most efficacious means to
this end, I count keen and observant criticism. If I were you, I would
substitute another prayer in my petition to the critics ;—I would beg
them to do their best to teach the managers what they will not be
taught by authors j viz., that there is such a thing as a high standard of
stage-art, and critics ready to apply that standard fearlessly and im-
partially, whether on the first night of a piece, or »ny other,—keen to
E oint out all cases in which that standard is not reached, whether the
lilure be due to the shortcoming of manager, actor, or author.
I would affix only one condition to this severity—that the critic be
careful to lay the saddle оя the right horse. If he be, in nine cases out
of ten, I will venture to say the saddle will not be kid on the author's
back. It is the fashion to speak contemptuously of stage authorship
now-a-days. We may not be geniuses exactly, my dear confrere, or even
the cleverest of craftsmen; but if our work too often deserves the
contempt which it receives in such abundance, what measure should be

And yet how mercifuiin most cases is the critic's dealing with manager
and actor, as compared with his scornful treatment of that poor Pil-
garlic, the author! Depend upon it, the dramatic author's prayer to

THIS is the season for athletic sports, an amusement not without

one caution—use every effort to outrun each other, but do not attempt

FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
HERE is the moat wondrous scrap of news
from Paris that we remember seeing for many a
long day :—
"Full dress is neither eccentric nor exaggerated."
It may be noticed that full dress, in certain
fashionable circles, pretty frequently accompanies
a somewhat empty head. For this reason it is
likely to assume eccentric shapes: and when
these are laid aside for unexaggerated clothing,
we surely may congratulate the fashionable world
on something that approaches a display of com-
mon sense. A further indication of fashionable
sanity is afforded by the following :—
"There is but little doubt that trained dresses
will be discarded for ball-dress, and the half-long
adopted instead—a fashion more graceful and conve-
nient for dancing."
This is a wise reform; but we are haters of
half-measures, Half-long dresses for the ball-
room are certainly not likely to be half so bad as
longer ones. Still, a man who waltzes with a
girl in a long, or half-long, dress, is pretty sure
to put his foot in it. Half-long dresses surely
can t be half so convenient for a dance as wholly
short ones. A similar improvement, going half-
way only, is described as follows :—
"Walking dresses are made short, just touching
the ground.
Dresses just touching the ground may clearly
be kept cleaner than those which used to draggle
on it. But why should ladies' dresses touch the
ground at all, unless, indeed, their wearers wish
to act as street-sweepers?
A "RETIRING ADDKESS."—A Shy Manner.
THE HISTORICAL MANUSCRIPTS COMMISSION.
"The first report of the Historical MSS. Commission is published to-day."
THE following are a few extracts from this interesting and valuable
report -.—
A complete scries of the great LORD CHATHAM'S washing bills,
extending from 1769 to 1776, a period of seven years, has been dis-
cçvered ш a linen press in a cottage covered with ivy in Rutlandshire,
his Lordship's laundress having married a gamekeeper late in life, a
man of some substance, but with a hare-lip and of the Muggletonian
persuasion. These long sought for documents put an end to all further
controversy on one of the most disputed points in English History,
and prove, beyond a doubt, that after the war began with America,
LORD CHATEAU neglected his personal appearance, and used, in the
week, barely half the number of cravats he was in the habit of wearing
before the rupture between the Mother Country and her Colonies.
The bills themselves bear testimony to the careful and methodical
habite of "The Great Commoner." The items are all checked with
his well known ticks, and in several instances alterations have been
made in his own handwriting. For example, in the important entry
"4 pairs of silk stockings" the 4 has been converted into a 3; and in
"2 nightcaps" the "2я has been struck out, "1" written over it,
and a line drawn through the final "a," a capital С (CHATHAM) being
set in the margin opposite.
As many as forty-five letters from SWIFT to SACCHARISSA, hitherto
unknown to the most industrious antiquary, were found (by courtesy of
the rats) in the muniment room of an old family mansion in Mon-
mouthshire, for many generations the residence of the ancient family
of MARTIN, who were allied by marriage to the SCRIBBLERUSES,
SWIFT'S great friends and contemporaries. One of the series is a
remarkable contribution to the history of the period, and will be in-
valuable to the MACAULAT of the twenty-second century. In it the
Dean (who dates from Cork Street) tells SACCHARISSA of a litf-à-tête
/dinner he had had with LOBD BOLINGBROKE at his town house on
Tower Hill—merely their favourite dishes, a knuckle of veal, a marrow
tone and tansy pudding—and narrates a visit they afterwards made to
Ranelagb, where they saw the first display of Bengal lights ever
witnessed in this country, in honour of LORI) OLIVE'S victory at
Seringapatam, and met the young Pretender arm in arm with SACIJE-
YERELL, disguised as a couple of auctioneers.
SIB. WILLIAM TEMPLB'S correspondence, while he was ambassador
at the Hague, with his head gardener at Moor Park (from which
copious extracts are given in the Appendix) will be perused with eager
avidity. His glowing description of the new vegetable, asparagus,
which the great diplomatist introduced into this country shortly after-
wards carefully packed in matting, on his return from negotiating the
Peace of Boulogne-sur-Mer, when he presented the first bundle ever
seen in England on his knees to the Queen and Princesses at Hampton
Court Palace (see Pepys's Diary and the picture of the Scene by SIR
ABRAHAM NEWLAND, K.C.B.); his minute instructions as to the
planting of winter greens; his anxieties about slugs; and the fore-
thought he shows for the welfare of his peaches and nectarines, afford
us a most agreeable insight into TEMPLE'S character, disposition, and
tastes, and fully justify CLARENDON'S well-known panegyric of him as
"a man of singular equipoise and fairness of judgment, not stooping
to the despicable arts of obsequious favourites, but borne aloft by that
steadfastness of purpose ever apparent in bis most particular transac-
tions, wherein he showed complete indifference alike to vulgar favour
and the flattering smiles of a Crown, and so was preserved in the
midst of a corrupt time from the intrigues of party spirit and the
neglect of an untoward age."
The whole history of BACON'S contention with SIR JULIUS C.ESAK aa
to the right of pre-emption of the mussels found on the foreshores
of the northern coast of Huntingdonshire is laid bare to us in the
household books of the MARQUIS OF TÜXFORD, which hie Lordship
volunteered to submit to the inspection of Her Majesty's Commis-
sioners; and the same family records disclose a picture of the domestic
life of our English nobles of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries,
for a parallel to which we must have recourse to the grave chronicles
of JOSEFHUS JOCULARIUS, and the authentic historiés of MATTHZW 01
GOTHAM.
Numberless other facto of the highest possible importance and in-
trinsic interest have been elicited by the valuable researches of the
Commission. We can now only briefly refer to a few of them—such
as the report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the
chemical composition of the matches found on the person of GUIDO
FAWKES, signed by the Chairman, ROGEH BACON; the incidental
notice of the first introduction of Hatstands into this country from
the Persian Gulf; the name and address of QUEEN ELIZABETHS) wig-

THE FOURTH R» QUESTION COMPOSED.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
You will perhaps be disposed to think that the Education
question is materially illustrated by the case of the Buckinghamshire
criuiiual Mulms, dismissed from this life on Monday last week at
A.vlesbury. He had murdered a little boy from the mere propensity to
kill. In some account of him the /'/•./••.•.• said :—
He has been giren to reading more than is the custom among agricultural

The result of this study follows, according to the student:—
"He says tbat, while he was Bitting by the aide of the little boy NEW-
i'.i KV, a sudden thought came into hie head that he should like to kill him,
and he could not retist the impulie."
Then come details, succeeded by a physiognomical description of this!
cultivator of such literature as the Illustrated Police Netos:—
"MORRS, who it not quite twenty years of age, is evidently of a very low
trpp of humanity. He has a short, narrow forehead and etu<ill head, and great
thickness about the base of the skull. His hair is very thick, straight, ¡mil
i:il', and project« over the forehead like the thatch of a house, and he ho» а
peculiarity to a remarkable degree which is observed among men of little sen-
sibility of nature—the lobei of the ears particularly large and thick."
Hardly anybody need be told that the head above described is one
of the brutal idiotic type. How far, if in any degree, higher than an
absolute idiot MOBBS was it is now too late to inquire. He has been
hanged.
Whatever may he thought about the reality of the organs, so called,
in the system of Phrenology, it is undeniable that their names expresa
mental realities. Those names are handy words for explanation in
talking about the mind and its dispositions; let me use a tew of them.
Limited as were MOBBS'S faculties, be had received some education.
His "Language" had been educated so as to enable him to read. A
low self-education followed. He himself educated his own " Individu-
ality" and "Eventuality," or powers of knowing objects, matters of
fact, acts, and deeds. He educated these faculties by reading tales,
which being tales of murder, he at the same time educated his "De-
strnctiyeness." This narrow and vile education proved to be an
education for the Drop.
We know that MOBBS had been taught one of the Three R's. For
aught we know he may have also been taught the other two. If so.
his education extended to "Constrnctiveness," "Form." "Size," and
"Number." But whether or no, that would have made no difference
as to his self-culture of " Destructiveuesa" and its result.
From numerous cases, more or less like that of MOBBS, it has
appeared that mere instruction in the Three R's will not suffice to
prevent crime. Thence is inferred the need of instruction in a certain'
Fourth U. Very rightly; the instruction meant being real, ¡nul not
merely nominal, instruction in the R No. 4—Religion.
What then does instruction in the Fourth I!, or Religious Instruc-
tion, in relation to the mind that is to receive it, mean, Sir f
I submit that it means teaching which tends to inform, and culti-
vate, and strengthen, the sentiments by whose possession man differs
from the gorilla, the pig, and other beasts tbat are supposed to perish.
To wit, so far as we can enumerate them, "Veneration," or the feel-
ing of reverence, "Marvellousness," spirituality and openness to
faith, "Hope," which needs no synonym, "Benevolence," the predis-
position to charity, "Conscientiousness," the love of justice, "Firm-
ness," natural constancy, and I may add in connection with the Fourth
R taught as it should be even to "Street Arabs," "Ideality," or the
sense of the Beautiful.
Uf course, Mr, Punch, the sentiments above specified, are all power-
fully addressed and affected by the mode of teaching the Fourth R at
all our great Public Schools. More than verbiage, under that name,
is taught at those institutions.
ËABL RUSSKLL proposes to meet the difficulty, arising from the
dissension about what the Fourth R means, which impedes the teaching
of that R in the projected national schools, by limiting instruction
therein to reading a portion of Scripture daily, and singing a hymn.
Has the noble Lord considered how far this scheme would go to cul-
tivate "Veneration," "Marvellousness." &o. P To be sure, there are
hymns and hymns. Does his Lordship, however, mean a hymn sung to
an ordinary "parochial" or "congregational" psalm tuae V The
Eton, the Winchester, the Westminster, the Harrow, and Rugby
scholars are not, I think, taught the Fourth H, by being practised in
! this kind of psalmody.
Yet EARL RUSSELL'S suggestion has it« value. True sacred music
certainly does arouse and inspire "Veneration," &c. I mean such
music as that which overcame UKUR BREITMANN :—
1
"Dey blay crate ding« from MOZAHT,
BEBTHOVEN, and MÉHUL,
Hit chorals of SEBASTIAN BACH,
Sooplime and peaudiful.
Der Breitmann feel like holy aainU,
De tears roon down Ыв funs;
Und he sopped out, . . . ."
—his devotional feelings in High Dutch. But, besides, sacred music
is unsectarian. Indeed, Mr. Punch, may we not say it is the ouly
possible means of teaching a " common" Fourth Rf
But would the Ratepayers stand the needful organ and organist?
Perhaps they might at least be induced to ail' ml a tolerably good burn-l
organ, playing some of the nobler simple psalm tunes, such as " The
Old Hundredth," "Adeste, Fideles," or "Marti» Luther's Hymn," thus,
with ч little enlargement, carrying out EAHL RUSSELL'S idea. In tins
expedient there would be only a superficial resemblance to the Thibetan
Prayer-grinding Machine. Veneration," and the rest of the senti-
ments relative to the Fourth R would really be appealed to, aud
educated.
In short, Mr. Punch, I beg to ask, if you can't agree how to teach
the Fourth R through the faculty of " Language," why not try aud
teach it through the faculties of " Time" and "Tune F" Assuredly,
the Fourth R will not really be taught at all unless some meaus are
taken to educate Veneration and the rest of the higher sentiments.
Please, Sir, remember that the practicability of thus harmonising dis-
cordant, sects is quite independent on the verity or the humbug of
that alleged Science the nomenclature of which, for convenience, has
been employed by Yours truly,
,it Н1.М1ЛИ BUMFS.
P.S. People in general have sufficient ear for music—or, as I say,
"Time" and "Tune." If there are dunces as to music, there are
dunces as to language. Instances need not be named, I fear you
will say.
FALSIFIED FACES.
A TEA-DEALER, professing, for his own part, to sell pure tea, informs
the public that " to disguise inferior leaves, the Chinese face tea for
the English market with mineral powder." We cannot exactly say,
dearest,—
"mutato nomine, de te
Fabula narratur."
Because, it is to be feared, the statement that the Chinese face their
tea with mineral powder for the English market is not fabulous.
Otherwise, tea faced for the English market, and a girl faced fur the
marriage market with the like stuff, are equally a swindle, and both the
reverse of nice.
Not Improbable.
"The ladies are getting quite the epper hand on the violin."—Musical
Standard.
As the ladies, some in this country and some in America, are voting
at elections, practising as doctors, acting as Magistrates, serving as
jury women, presiding and speaking at public meetings, and doing
various other things hitherto thoughtlessly supposed to be the proper
and peculiar work of that poor over-rated creature man, there can be
no doubt that they are getting the upper hand, and mean in future to
play nothing but first fiddle.
BUTCHERS SUPERSEDED.
(According to Advertisement, by " The Cooked Meat in Tins at 7J<?. per Ib.")
COOKED meat in tins is coming into use.
Those meat-tins, Butcher dear, will cook your goose.
The Motley and the Ermine.
1 г judicial proceedings in England were as commonly characterised
by impertinences, altercations, violations of the rules of evidence by
counsel, and expressions of partiality or passion on the part of the
judge, as they are in France, how very often we should be guilty of
contempt of court!

CHURCH ARTILLERY.
CARDINAL, ANTONELLI has parried the thrusts of COUNT DARÜ and
BARON 15 кг.s т with all the skill of a practised fencer. The ministers
of France and Rome object to the twenty-one canons de Ecrlesiá, that
they sap all the foundations of constitutional law and political allegi-
aoce, and thus render it necessary for States as well as Churches to Ъе
represented in the Council. When Church (they argue) intrudes on
the domain of Slate, State cannot allow Church to have it all her own
way. The claim appears reasonable. But ANTONELLI answers :—
"In Mich mattere it in essential to distinguish between the absolute and
theoretical and the relative and practical sides; the Church being a spiritual
and divinely constituted society, it ia ite duty to oner to men's consciences
solutions of all the ргиЫешв which human life encounter«; but the exercise
of this spiritual right in no way implies an intention on the part of the
Church to meddle with political questions."
Sailors have a name of their own for the dummy guns, wliirli
clever commanders have sometimes mounted on an indefensible
fort, or an ill-armed frigate, to humbug an enemy by an outward
show of strength. They call them "quakers." CARDINAL ANTONELLI
•wishes to persuade France and Austria that the twenty-one Church
Canons are "quakers "—only meant to make Rome look formidable,
not capable of being fired, and not calculated to hurt a baby. We
really believe CARDINAL ANTONELLI has spoken the truth— for once.
Do the POPE and ARCHBISHOP MANNING agree with him, we
wonder P
THE DOUBLE GOVERNMENT OF LONDON.
THE City of London, as to its sanitary arrangements, is under the
twofold jurisdiction of the Corporation and the Board of Works.
Between these two ruling Powers the City comes to be more carefully
taxed than regulated. There is a resemblance and a difference between
the City of London as it is now, and the suburb of Brentford as it was
once upon a time. The resemblance is that, as Brentford had two
Kings so London has two Governments. Herein lies the difference,
that, whereas the two Kings of Brentford smelled at one rose, the
Board of Works and the Corporation of London apply their respective
noses to one (ewer.
NOT A ROSE-BUDDHIST.
IN all fear and trembling, we submit the following to the advocates
of Woman's Rights. It ia from a work called Modern Buddhism.
What Buddhism, ancient or modern, means, is not to the purpose, and
this is. The subject is "woman's right" to have a good many hus-
bands. Hear the Buddhist :—
"Men, however many wives thev have, and whatever their like or dislike
to any of them, have no desire to kill them; but if women had more husbands
than one, they would wish to kill all but the one they liked best; for such а
their nature.
Of course, we do not mean that polyandry is among the plans of the
lady reformers, on the contrary, they seem to think that it is rather a con-
descension, not to say a humiliation for a woman to take one husband,
but what do they say to this Oriental light upon the "nature" of the
(sometime) gentler sex P If they get votes, will they proceed to dis-
franchise the majority of masculine Electors, on the plea that 'tis their
"nature " to?
Quite T'other!
COUNT BRAY, the new Bavarian Minister, thus sumf up the guiding
principles of his administration :—
"The object of the internal policy of Bavaria is conciliation, and not merely
a compromising removal of unfounded fears. The Government is not the
Government of a party. As regards our external policy, we will maintain
inviolate our independence. The situation of Bavaria is unassailable. Every
ai lark, every threat made in earnest, will occasion complications to which not
even the greatest Powers would expose themselves. I promise an open,
horn-*1, loyal, policy. No secret treaties, no secret engagement«, no political
secret« exist. We will be Germant, but at the same time Bavarians.
This sounds like anything but BRiYing.

PARLIAMENTARY WORK AND WAGES.
OHE obvious objection to Ma. P. A. TAYLOR'S motion for the payment of
Members, with a view to putting workmen in Parliament, is that the payment
required would be more than the working classes could stand to subscribe.
Sappose any skilled workman, say a journeyman bootmaker, is earning two or
three pounds a week, he would be a very great fool to give up his employment in
order to accept a seat in the House of Commons on a salary of £150, or £200 a
Tear. How long could he depend upon retaining it, and, failing to be re-elected,
how soon could he hope to get re-employed after having, for some years, given
up bootmakinc for legislation P He would find himself in the position of one
who had lost his all, and had no longer his leather and bristles to fall back upon.
If a prudent bootmaker, he would decline to take work above his last, like parlia-
mentary labour, unless his constituents would insure him a yearly competence
for life.
What must tax the mind of every man devoid of vanity is to imagine how any-
body but a self-sacrificing patriot can, unless concerned to defend the interests
of some railway or other joint-stock company against those of the public, be
otherwise than utterly indisposed to undertake the drudgery of serving in Parlia-
ment. To any philosopher, except a most uncommonly moral one, having to serve
as a Member of Parliament would be very much worse than having to serve on a
jury. It would be by so much worse by how much the Parliamentary Session is
longer than that of the Central Criminal Court, or the Assizes. The philosopher
wonders he does not see lists of persons liable to be elected Members of
Parliament posted on the Church doors.
The Sort of Justice for Ireland.
THE question lately raised about the remission of sentences has recalled to
mind the case of KIRWAN, who was convicted in December, 1852. of having
murdered his wife at Ireland's Eye, in Dublin Bay, and condemned to death,
but whose sentence the Irish Government of the day commuted to transportation
for life, on the ground that his guilt was insufficiently proved. This mitiga-
tion of punishment was illogical, but exemplifies a way of reasoning, which if
Governments were to proceed upon, their acts would no doubt be in general
satisfactory to the Irish mind.

GIVE A DOG, ETC.

ÜR excellent friend DR.
GUTHRIB has again been
called over the coals by some
Scotch bigots, (BUCKLE has
limned them for all time,)
for his advocacy of the cas-!
torn of standing in church, j
daring the singing. Setting
aside all considerations of
veneration, the physical fact
that a person sings much
belter when standing than
when sitting, would seem to
indicate the proper position.

"Sound an Alarm!" But
(he gallant Doctor is quite
able to take care of him-
self. In a speech, he cha-
racterised a certain inso-
lent pamphlet called the
Walch-word as the " watch-
dog," adding, "and a
mangy car it is." We
should have been happy to
help him in any way, but

The fame we come too late to share."
THE GREAT UNTAXED IN POSSE?
To a deputation from the Financial Reform Union that came the
other day memorialising for the entire exemption from taxation of tea,
coffee, and sugar, the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQOER, who cannot
quite allow that the masses' fair slmre of the national expenses ought
to be paid by the select few, made answer :—
"He did not agree that it was right that the working clauses should be
wholly exempt from taxation other than that on «pirituoua and fermented
liquore. He thought that a teetotaller, for instance, an honest hard-working
тип, might fairly be called upon for gome contribution towards the expenses
of the country. Eut if they took all these dutie»aw*y there wouH be nothing
left but those on spirituous and fermented liquore. (A Voice—'The
Income-tax.')"
In their address to the Finance Minister the Financial Union Depu-
tation had spoken of the previous repeal of duties on articles of con-
sumption as "relaxations of our fiscal system." The gentleman who
cried "Income-tax," meaning "Make the Income-tax payer pay for
the remission of my tea, coffee, and sugar duties as well as his own,"
may perhaps with some permissible licence of English speech, be said
to advocate the extension of our confisca) system. The Income-lax
(which alone paid for the Abyssinian war) is at present only a
measured confiscation. It would be an unmeasured confiscation if the
CHANCBLLOH OP THE EXCHEQUER, were willing and able to oblige that
gentleman. But MB. LOWE told him that :—
"The people he spoke of were below the Income-tax, but a mnn, even
though he had not a hundred a-year, derived considerable benefit from the
country, and in hie opinion at least it would be a very bad principle- fur them
to say that there should be two ciaste», one who imposed taxes, and another
who paid them."
The Financial Revolution, calling itself Reform, Union, thinking
otherwise, demands a " free breakfast table" with free earnings for one
class to be purchased with an impost on the earnings of another class.
Button up your pockets, is the exhortation which this demand suggests
to everybody whose pocket is within the reach of the person who utiers
it. And no prudent Chancellor of the Exchequer, even if he were a
rogue, and wanted to curry favour with the Financial "Reform"
Union, would venture to make Schedule D much шоге unjust than it
is. A general determination of the tax payers to button up their
pockets would soon beget a general scale of self assessment whereby a
tax, thereon, greatly depending, would be made to abolish itself.

Long before Phaethon's prads were yoked in the cab of Aurora,
All were agog. Lato compteront lilora costa.
Most visuri the sport : pars et certare paraît.
Four crack boats, omni délecta; classe carintg,
Entered the lists gravibus remis for the sway of the waters.
First the Pristis, swift, as a dart, with Mnestheus her Captain:
Next the big tub Chirnœra, Captain Gyas; and thirdly,
Sergestus, in the huge Centauras. Lastly Cloant.hus
Sits in the old blue boat the Scylla, which hails him magister.
Trojans each of the crew. Consurgunt ordine reaii.
Then comes the toss for the place. On the thwarts, with oarblades
extended,
Expectant signum. It comes. They are off in an instant,
E'en as the flying steeds a carcere speeding at Epsom.
Cheers from the Danks hail the lucky start. Ferit athera clamor.
First from the ruck shoots Gyas, and close on his rudder Cloanthus.
After him Centaurus. Лцио discrimine Prista.
Now they are nearing the goal; and Gias, well out in mid-channel,
Howls to his rectoren /inn's, Mencetes, the coxswain,
"Why steer so wide? liug the shore: and leave those lubbers the
middle."
Litas ama But coxswain Menoetes stuck to his tactics,
Saxa timent. If he grounded, he knew 'twas all up with Ctiimxra.
Gyas looks back; and, close on his stern, sees the bows of the Scylla.
Caluily she radii Her lavum. The blue boat is heading!
Gyas riled, and otliius quit« of the rules of decorum,
Simply falls foul in the coxswain and pitches him into the water,
Doing his work himself as rector, et ipse maguter!
Now comes a spurt for second place with Centaurus and Pristis.
Sergestus capit ante locum. Centauras is leading.
Then shouts Mnesthnus, " Your backs to your work. Insurgile remit.
Go it. my Trnjaus. We can't win the race, but work for thu second!"
DM n't. they pull? And didn't the old boat creak in her timbers Ï
Slightly it punished his crew; as their creber ankelitus told him,
When came chance to their aid; Sergestus got hopelessly grounded.
Now there were only two in. the race, the Scylla and Prist.is—
Only tlie "old blue boat" on ahead—Coull they hupe to outstrip her?
Then clamor inaeminat. The shouts and Hie wnrk were redoubled.
Scylla will win it, or die. Successes have told up-iu Prisiis.
Anything 's now on the cards. Passant, quia posse videntur.
Well nigh the race had been drawn, when lo! an unlooked-for détou-
rnent!
Scylla's captain went suddenly in for private devotion.
Tendena bot\\ palmus to the sea he prayed to Neptunu«,
Proiuising beet and wine as a supper for submarine Diri.
Heard were bis vows in the regions aquatic; and Pater Portunns
Give him a lift. Like a feather-tipp'd shaft, sped Scylla in parlant,
Leaving the Pristis to paddle serene, a respectable second.
A PROBLEM SOLVED.
WE have found out at last where the Horse Marines serre when
afloat. It must be in the " Horse Latitudes."
Distressing- Occurrence.
THE Boat Race does not, seem to have, passed off without at least
one appalling catastrophe to mar the day's victory. Two papers relate
it, but with a variation in their statements. Une says, "The Oxford
crew unquestionably fell to pieces," mentioning tho exact spot where
this terrible accident happened, after pissing Chiswiuk Church;"
the other relieves us of our worst apprehensions by only speaking of
"one or two of the crew falling all to pieces" (at Hammersmith,
Bridge), thus leaving us to hope that the majority of the gallant
fellows escaped such an untoward end.

MEDIUMSHIP. HOME AND FOREIGN.
THOSE who have been accustomed to suppose that Spiritualism, at
Rome, was treated as sorcery, will be surprised by the statement of the
Times' Special Correspondent that :—
"PALMA, the Estática, has good n«ws for CARDINAL WISEMAN'S friende.
He came out of purgatory on the 7th instant. For some генном or other there
has been great anxiety on the subject. Unless it be that the Cardinal certainly
had to be cured of a rather random style of statement, reference, and quotation,
I am not aware that he wanted more than usual purgation. However, he is
out now, so Bays the medium."
Some sceptical minds will perhaps wish to know whether the visions
of PALMA (hysterical young person ?) are palmed off by the ecclesias-
tical authorities as supernatural. Do their reverences recognise Miss
P ALMA'S Spiritualism whilst they condemn MR. HOME'S P The Estática
is what Spiritualists call a trance-medium; so is HOME; and MR.
HOME, it is said, does, in his trances, things with his palms seemingly
even more impossible than any appearances presented by the palms of
PALMA; from whom he quite bears away the palm, unless the Newspaper
and Magazine devoted to Spiritualism have fathered the most tre-
mendous "whoppers" and " bangers" upon certain noble lords, and
others. According to their alleged testimony, MR. HOME, at some
recent seances, has raked live ccals out of the fire with his naked hands,
and gone about with them in his grasp. He has not only held them
himself, unhurt, bnt has also caused other persons, in whose hands he
has placed them, to hold them without injury or inconvenience. He
once crowned the head of MR. SAMUEL CARTER HALL with a great
red-hot coal. This ornament gave the wearer no more pain than a
foolscap in its place would have given him. It is difficult to imagine
MR, HOME capable of thus heaping coals of fire on the heads of his
friends, without burning them. He might be conceded able to handle
fire himself, however, by means no more occult than a sort of chemical
palmistry, but anyhow he surpasses anything that we have heard of
PALMA; for no one has pretended that PALMA had any hand in getting
CARDINAL WISEMAN out of purgatory.
It has been further averred on the eye-witness of persons of quality,
that MR. HOME, whilst entranced, has been elongated and contracted
in stature several inches, like the child's plaything called a Jack-in-the-
Box. This beats the most wonderful of all the performances enume-
rated by SWIFT in his account of JOHN EMANUEL SCHOITZ, "the
wonder of all the wonders that етег the world wondered at ;" but still
more wonderful is the undoubted fact that men say they saw it.
"NeTer ЬеНете half of what you hear" is a good rule to apply to
most extraordinary narratives. In the mean time, we are happy to
hear that MR. HOME, in playing with fire, has been practising
Spiritualism without burning his fingers.
"QUITE THE REVERSE."
MY dear PETER TAYLOR, you '11 find it a failure—
This attempt to get Members allowed daily wages-
Such a plan might nave done, in the year known as "one,"
'Midst the eocene innocence of the dark ages.
Why for precedents rake in antiquity's embers,
When the case has been altered, as you 'd say " in toter"
How on earth can you hope to see voters pay Members,
At a time when the rule is that Member pays roter P
FlunkeyiamuB in Excelsie.
A LETTER from Rome, addressed to a contemporary, tells us
that:-
"The MARQUIS DB Вднютшл wie received by the POPE before hi«
departure, but in such a hurry that his Holiness was not surrounded by the
usual officers of his antechamber, and the Ambassador (by permission) pre-
et'MU'd himself in a black coat instead of his official uniform."
Perhaps there exists at Rome a tradition that, when St. Peter was)
Pope, he was accustomed to admit no one to an audience who pre-
sented himself (unless by permission) otherwise than in full toga.

Save in the way of kindness, charged with treating and corruption!

To set the grass growing in our streets, to stop the ploughs in our

And blight our surest harvest, by disfranchising our boroughs;
Take away a Briton's birth-right—enslave soul and o'er-crow body—
Which is 'oust; is his castle, and as for his vote, what he does with
that 's nothing to nobody!
Then interpose your régis between us and destruction,'
And of no more disfranchising bills permit the introduction, _
Name no more Election Commissioners to expose and insult their bettors;
Or, if you are forced to name 'em, take care that they're dead letter*!
Happy Application.
A COBHESPONDENT of the Inverness Courier tells the following story:
"Л propos of conscience clauses, a friend of mine lately announced to a
party of guests that on going down to dinner he meant to toy grace, according
to use, but that if any had conscientious objections to that ceremony they
might come down five minutes later. Some secularists were present, but did
not avail themselves of the permission."
Very good. But Cardinal Сиьъта would have called them "soupers."

AT SPES NON FRACTA.
RINCE CHRISTIAN lias been
presiding over a meeting
of the Society of Arts for
organising the Fine Arts
Department of the Inter-
national Exhibition of
1871 :-
"The special object of the
proposed annual exhibition
the Prince explained, "was
to show how closely artistic
culture could be connected
with works of industry. In
modern times we had lost
sight of that intimate alli-
ance between art and indus-
try which woe characteristic
of ancient and méditerai |
days. What we had now
arrived at was the revival of
that wholesome alliance, it
was hoped that these exhi-
bitione would encourage the
application of artistic talent
to objecte of utility of every
description. He could quote many instances from the history of art to
•how that it was not beneath the dignity of its most illustrious professors to
combine the useful with the ornamental. MICHAEL ANGKI.O was a sculptor,
painter, and architect; ю was RAPHAEL; LEONARDO DA. VINCI was an
engraver, architect, and painter; FKANCIA was a goldsmith and painter;
CELLINI, a goldsmith and paintrr; HOLBEIN, an architect, painter, and
designer; ALBERT DURER a painter and engraver. Surely these great
examples would stimulate the art-studenU of our own day to a similar
breadth of culture.''
Bravely spoken, PRINCE CHRISTIAH. But if the promoters of the
Exhibition loot to see this object realised, they should borrow another
patron from the Pilyrinfs Progress, and get Hopeful to preside over
their meetings along with Christian,

THE TAXPAYER TO THE TEETOTAL ALLIANCE.
You will stop the liquor traffic if you can; of course you know
What millions, then, will into the Exchequer cease to flow.
How, Gentlemen, propose yon to restore the revenue?
What notion of a budget readjusted meets your view P
To compensate the duties gone with spirits, wine, and beer,
Say, will yon tax the draughts which not inebriate but cheer?
Shall tea and coffee's increased rate the deficit make up,
And sugar some addition pay for sweetening the cup F
Sherbet the subject of excise perhaps, too, will be made,
Along with soda-water, giuger-beer, and lemonade.
Perhaps, ye Maine Law orators who town and country "stump,"
You '11 e'en impose a duty on the cistern and the pump.
'Mongst ways and means conceivable there is a mean and way,
Whereon if you do meditate, be kindly pleased to saj
Mean you to load yet more one class of overladen backs;
Make those pay for your Liquor Law who pay the Income-tax?
Not if I know it; not if I can help it, masters mine,
Shall you for others' drunkenness amerce me with a fine,
My rents, gains, earnings, confiscate, wine, grog, and beer taboo,
Deprive me of my drink and of my money rob me, too.
Great Want of Conscience Money.
THE CHANCELLOR OP TUB EXCHEQUER never acknowledges the
receipt of the first half of a note, or any other remittance from
"A Teetotaller," of conscience-money on account of non-contribution
to the revenue occasioned by total abstinence from consumption of
exciseable liquors.
LOOK BEFORE YOU SPEAK.
ASKING a lady what her accomplishments are, is, generally speaking,
harmless enough. Still, in these days, it might in. some cases cause
embarrassment to put the question, "Do you paint P"
A FINANCIAL TITLE.
SHOULD the CHANCELLOR pp THE EXCHEQUER be made a Baronet,
he would naturally take the title of Sii-plus LOWE
THE HEIGHT OF JUST TAXATION.
AN article in the Saturday Review on "MR. LOWE and the Income-
tax," apparently one of a series of articles written by a gentleman who
rejoices in the blessing of a secure independence, contains the usual
sneers at the complainants against Schedule D., and contains, also, its
customary vindication. The perfect justice of taxing permanent and
temporary incomes alike is thus demonstrated :—
"A sound financier, when he has to raise a certain revenue, endeavours to
leave all sections of the community in the same relative condition in which
he found them. In the absence of taxation, a fund-holder mid a tradesman,
receiving equal incomes, would vary m wealth by the difference between a
perpetuity and the estimated duration of the business. A Ux of fourpence or
sixpence in the pound, in one case, lasting for ever, and in the other termi-
natingwith the income itself, adjusts itself with the nicest accuracy to the
circumstances of both parties. It is true that the proprietor, having a pro-
vision secured to hia family, has not the same need of saving which affects
the shopkeeper; but the proposition that he has more to spend is identical
with the original assumption that he is richer. The tax-gatherer has no
right to inquire whether money is hoarded, or squanders J, or legitimately
expended."
The original assumption that the man of perpetual income is richer
than the man of terminable income being undeniable, and the propo-
sition that be has more to spend being identical with that assumption,
the difference of the former from the latter appears to be that he is
simply richer. As the receiver of an annual income of which he has
more to spend than another who receives the same income hut has less
to spend, is he not by so much the more rich of the two? I'm how
much less to spend has the man of terminable income who ueeds in-
defiuitely to save P Has he not indefinitely less? Is he not indefiuiiely
poorer P Is it not a truth, if a pun, to say that a terminable and au
interminable income are incommensurate?
Does the Saturday Reviewer mean to say that the happy man possessed
of a competence which be has no fear of losing, and can leave behind
him, is not immensely better able to afford paying an Income-tax all
his life than the miserable wretch whose means of subsistence muy
very likely end to-morrow, is to pay the same amount yearly whilst his
precarious income lasts P Does he further mean to say, that in the
imposition of a tax no regard should be had to comparative ability to
afford the payment P The height of just taxation, then, according to
his idea of it, would perhaps be a poll-tax of uniform amount, levied
indiscriminately on everyone out of whom it could be screwed.
LE MIEUX EST L'ENNEMI DU BIEN.
OF all queer International undertakings, an International Horse-Shoe
Company is announced as in the market,—
"With a capital of £400,000, half to be first issued, in shares of £10. for
extending in all parts of the world the manufacture of horse-shoos by patent
machinery, especially the 'Goodenough' patent shoes."
The гадая d'etre for the company, and its prospect of profits, being
based, we presume, on the plea that the horse-shoes now in use are not
good enough.
New Johnsonian Dogma.
(From a Forthcoming Edition of BOZZT'S Opus Magnum.)
I ASKED my illustrious friend the reason why the conversation of
certain persons of our acquaintance usually, when they met together,
consisted of banter. "Sir," said Da. JOHNSON, "it is their mutual
contempt. Each of them despises the other too much to talk with him
seriously." "Sir," he added, "they would be unable to talk much
else amongst themselves than nonsense, even if they tried."
Cold Comfort.
MR. COLE explained at the late meeting for the promotion of the
Pine Arts Department of the proposed Exhibition of 1871, in answer
to a doubt expressed by MR. MILLAIS whether painters or possessors of
pictures would send them, that pictures would be sent on the same
conditions as to the Royal Academy. That means, with the chance of
two in three being rejected. Can't MR. COLE find a more encouraging
precedent P

PARLIAMENTARY GRAMMARIANS.
MB. GLADSTONE, a master of language, has beaten so many philo-
logical facts into the heads of uneducated Members of Parliament, that
the natural ingratitude of persons who have been benefited broke out
viciously the other night, when the PREMIER was thought to have
tripped. He said that he would, in a certain case, have made a con-
cession "reluctantly, but ungrudgingly." Various Members emitted
noises. Their education must still be conducted in the primary way.
If one of them, at an election, were told that he must bribe a certain
voter, the candidate (we trust) would not assent at all. But if he did
assent, it would be (we hope) with " reluctance." But he would not
(we suppose) "grudge" the half sovereign, or try to get the vote
for seven shillings. There are more things in JOHNSON and WEBSTEB,
Gentlemen, than are dreamt of in your philology.
"Mind the Paint."
Моет useful body, the Society of Arts. Always do the right thing
at the right time. For example, at the commencement of another
London season they manfully face what is believed to be a growing
evil, and acting, we presumeren the principle of making the best of a
• meetings
on these
bid thing, cause a paper to be read at one of their weekly meetings
"On Surface Decoration." We hope ladies are admissible
occasions.
Analogy.
MR. O'BRAI.LAGIIAN suggests a schein«- for the pacification of his
native country, which, he says, ought to have been tried long ago, but
cannot be for some time to come. He points to the expedient adopted
by EDWAED THI FIBST to conciliate the Welsh, and proposes that it
»ball be repeated on the next opportunity by causing a Royal infant to
become the Prince of Wales through being bom in Ireland.
MONASTERIES AND MONASTERIES.
OF course the order for Ma. NEWDEOATE'S Select Committee of
inquiry as to the property and domestic economy of Convents will be
discharged. On second thoughts Parliament will abandon any idea of
resisting the influence exerted by the Roman Catholic Clergy, and
evincing any mistrust of the wisdom and goodness wherewith institu-
tions which they direct are regulated. But our Legislators cannot
have implicit confidence in the mock-turtle monasteries of Ritualism,
and in that peculiar compound of monkery and nunnery, the Agape-
mone. It is a pity that, since what is sauce for the goose must be also
sauce for the gander, Roman Catholic conventual establishment a cannot
be protected from investigation unless the same exemption is accorded
to others which are certainly abodes of superstition, and may, some
of them, possibly be dens of infamy.
Sold in Quantities.
THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL FOB IRELAND hopea before long to intro-
duce a measure into the House of Commons on the subject of the
Sale of Poison in that country. Meanwhile, let us hope, the Peace
Preservation Bill, with its newspaper clauses, will have a wholesome
effect in regulating and diminishing the sale of a poison which has
now for some time past been rather too extensively prepared for public
consumption in Ireland.
De Lunático Confringendo.
1т is expected that the Commissioners in Lunacy will immediately
enter on an inquiry as to the nature of the connection which is found
to exist between fractious Lunatics and fractured Ribs. They will
probably find that the fractures of the ribs are caused by muscular
action.

abreast of your excellent and irrepressible husband. As it seems to be
bis special function to start untimely hares in the House of Commons,
you cannot be more congenially occupied than in agitating crude
changes out-of-doors. 1 can only hope that if your agitation for the
electoral rights of your sex ever carries it as far as the polling-booth, it
will be content to stop there, and not press forward to the House. I
own I do not like to contemplate the possibility of two FAWCBTTS in
the field—or rather on the Commons—at once, and one of them in pet-
ticoats, uniting the normal feminine unwillingness to take an answer,
to the special irrepressibility and deafness to all reasons but his own of'
the eminent man whose wife, by natural selection, you bave become.
I find now that you have dropped the limitation with which your
sister agitators started, and that you go in for repealing the electoral
disabilities of all women—married as well as single. Yon are logical
in this, as well as wise in your generation. I am not aware whether
yon admit that man and wife is one flesh. I know you refuse to
admit that man and wife is one purse. I cannot wonder that you should
refuse to admit, by implication, that man and wife is one mind, and
that a vote giren to the wife will be only another given to the husband.
One object of the various movements you are so active in pro-
moting—Women's Suffrage Movement, Women's Separate Property
Movement, Women's Examination Movement, Women's University
Movement, Women's Admission to the Professions Movement, &c.;—
is the cultivation of a bold spirit of self-dependence and self-assertion
in your sex, which, if you could develop it to the full, would, I doubt
not, soon dispose of all objections to a married woman's franchise
founded on the assumption that the wife would be likely to be guided
by her husband in giving her vote.
Besides, if married women are not to have votes, you lose what seems
likely to be one of the chief motives to electoral activity among your
sex. As a rule, women—married women, in particular, with home
cares and laboura heavy upon them—care little, as yet, about politics.
You admit this, but explain it by their exclusion, thus far, from politi-
cal functions. But one thing they do care about—bless em !—and that
is the comfort of their homes, and the satisfaction of "paying their
way." Women, as far as I have seen, hate and fear debt, far more
than men, and when trusted with any voice or control in money mat-
ters, are keener bargainers, and better husbands of their husbands'
earnings than we are. Une value, at least, the franchise will have in
their eyes—it will be worth money. As they don't care for politics,
and do care for money—for family needs, above all—they will be likely
enough not only to see that their husbands vote for the side that pays
best—as the election reports show they do now, very generally, in the
class usually influenced by bribes—but will bring another vote to the
agent's book, for another lump of "sugar." But the unanimity of the
vote will be the wife's work, not the husband's; and what oftenest de-
termines it will be the colour of the candidate's money. I feel pretty
sure that whatever the female franchise may cost the country, it will
cost candidates a pretty penny.
Has it never occurred to you that in parcelling out life into two
great fields, the cne inside, the other outside the ntraae-doon, and in
creating two beings so distinct in body, mind, and affections as men
and women, the Framer of the Universe must have meant the two for
different functions P Can you deny, or shut your eyes to the fact that
a similar distinction runs through the whole animal kingdom? Surely,
во long as the masculine creature keeps aloof from the domain of the
feminine, and leaves to her the nursing and rearing and training of the
family, and the ordering and gracing of the home, there lies a tremen-
dously strong presumption against the wisdom of the feminine entry
on the masculine domain of business and politics?
I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance; but I have never pic-
tured yon to тунеЦ as one of those formidable, bass-voiced, big-armed
men-women, whose assault on the position of our sex is inspired by an
nnfitness to rule in their own. On the contrary, I should expect to
find you as charming, graceful, and feminine as your pretty name—
MILLICBNT. May 1 presume on that impression to ask you, entre
nous, and in strictest confidence, how you manage matters with the
Professor when you want to carry a point P Do you argue with him P
I should hope not, judging from my experience of him in the House.
I see how GLADSTONE fares at his hands. I imagine you must have a
very different way of going to work with him. It you have that wifely
power which is your right, at home, may I ask how this is acquired
and retained P Is it by any arts within masculine reach, or by a magic
all feminine, and all your own—such as all men succumb to from the
wand of some Circe or other P
Don't trouble yourself to give an answer. I read it in your face—on
your lips, that smile without speaking. Ah! there is the female
franchi«;, Frau Professorin. Give women votes! Bless you, dear,
bewitching creatures,—so strong while you are willing to be weak, so
irresistible while you choose to use your own weapons,—if you caret
for votes, you have them already. Have you not the men's P In^
word here is my dilemma, dear Mrs. Professor. Either women don't
care for votes—in which case they will make a bad use of them; or
they do care for them, in which case they have ours.
Look how you rule in that Parliament for the business of which you
oo care, and whose budget you control and appropriate. What man
dares call his home his own P What man, that deserves to be called a
man, with a good wife, wishes to be other than her humble servant,
bread-winner, hewer of wood and drawer of water, within the walls of
that sacred sphere, of which the household hearth is the central sun P
Depend upon it, if Nature had meant you for the franchise, you would
have had it long ago. But then, if yon had been in our place, we
should have been in yours. Do you think it would be a better world
for the change P Leaving you to ponder the question, I remain, my
dear Mrs. Professor, your fojthful friend and servant,
BABOO KESHUB CHUNDER SEN.

RiTHER TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.
THE following is an extract from an account of the Boat Race :—
"We understand it is the intention of the authorities to take an early
opportunity of coming to a clear understanding with the Thames Conservancy
on the subject of the steamers, and for keeping the river clear on practice days
on future occasions, failing which it ia their intention to remove the race
elsewhere, and this, we need scarcely eay, would be a great loss to the Metro-
polis and its inhabitants."
Is not this a little unreasonable P The Thames does not flow
merely to serve as a course for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race
—it has other uses. It is conserved for business as Wei] as pleasure.
The traffic on the river is not insignificant; and if it is to be inter-
fered with on practice days, as well as on the day of the race, the
"authorities" (we presume the two University Boat Clubs are meant.,)
will of course be ready to make compensation to those who otherwise
will suffer, that they may sport. The threat to remove the race else-
where must be borne with submission; perhaps, however, the loss
would not be confined to the Metropolis and its inhabitants; perhaps
the crews themselves and their University friends might not feel quite
the same stimulating interest in the struggle, if fought put in the
oriental privacy of King's Lynn, even with all the assistance the
Eastern Counties Railway could give it.
When we hear that the Derby is to be run on Salisbury Plain, we
shall believe in the possibility of the University Boat Race being
rowed and won on some other water than the Thames.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL
FEARS OF FEMALE EMANCIPATION.
E cannot but express
the fear that if women
had the votes to
which they are, as a
matter of abstract
justice, entitled, their
conduct, in relation
to the franchise and
the hustings, would
be generally of a frail-
ish character. If a
ten-pound note were
wauled in the house,
the lady thereof
would, in too many
cases, there is reason
to fear, think that
consideration the best
of all possible reasons
to determine her
vote fur a particular
candidate, and, in vo-
ting accordingly, she
would consider her-
self to vote for the
t rue Liberal. Treat-
ing, by means of ices
and champagne, or
tea and shrimps, is
quite as possible as
with gin and beer
and legs of mutton and trimming«. It might prove very usual:
and bribery might be practised to a great extent with gloves and
bouquets.
The progress of Liberalism would render it necessary that the years
of discretion, for electoral purposes, of women, should be prolonged to
twenty-five or twenty-six. The political opinions of a girl of twenty-
one would in most cases be moulded by the young officers and other
younpr gentlemen she was in the habit of dancing with—nearly all of
them Conservatives. Or else she would derive her politics from her
brothers fresh from a public school or University, almost sure to be
violent Tories, who would make her despise the Liberal party by
calling its members snoba and cads. By the, time a damsel is thirty she
has ceased to worship her brothers; and officers and other youths have
ceased to dance with her.
However, fiat jiatitia mat catlum. It is possible, though, that we
might extend the elective franchise to the softer sex without bringing
the firmament of the British Constitution about our ears.

FINE FEATHERS FOR FINE BIRDS.
IT is a new thing to see economy suggested in connection with the
fashions. Yet here is a little hint which any fashionable economist
may turn to some small profit, if she will so condescend :—
"Ladies can make their own hair-cloth skirts at half the price a«ked for
them; the material is not costly, and five or lix yards suffice to make a ruffled
ikirt."
After the commission of an act of more than usual extravagance, say
the buying of a new bonnet more than twice within a fortnight, a lady
might do penance by wearing a hair-cloth skirt of her own makiog,
with the view of saving thus no less than half its cost. Doubtless she
would then consider herself justified in launching into fresh expense,
and this is how she very easily might do so :—
"Feather trimmings are gaining ground daily, but on account of their colt
they will never become common. There is a mixture of peacock with тага-
bout, which is especially charming for evening wear."
Ladies with long purses may plume themselves on wearing the
costliest of feathers, and may be as proud as peacocks in their borrowed
peacock's plumes. But ladies, whose nests have not been so well
feathered, must content themselves with purchasing a less expensive
plumage, and instead of wearing the feathers of a peacock, must put up
with the plainer wardrobe of a partridge, or even, it may be, of a com-
mon barndoor fowl. A pretty girl, of course, whatever be her plumage,
will look a little duck; out she who spends more money on her feathers
than she can well afford must rather lie regarded as decidedly a goose.

"THO1 LOST TO SIGHT"
Aunt Jemima (from the country—her first experience of a "Hansom"). "Нот 1 Нот! STOP THE Новая I ЛУпввв 's THE COACHMAN!'
CONVERTED REVOLVERS.
MB. PUNCH—Mr DEAR SIB,
РЕК»IT me for one moment to invite your attention to a
subject which cuts a conspicuous lígurc in Town and Country man-
sions, the light fantastic toe.
To a well-balanced mind there is no more saddening sight than
hurry. Hurry now confronts us at every turn. Politicians, like
playgoers, are always in a hurry—to take their seats and secure good
places. Clever girls are in so great a hurry to sign their settlements,
that they are apt to forget MBS. G LASSE'S excellent advice, to first
catch your heir. Apply this to saltatory exercises. Will any candid
observer deny that there is not too much hurry in the "valse," and
that its charms are fugitive? Can we find in it that poetry of motion
which distinguishes the iicroic couplets of a minuet P—the high stepping
minuet face to face, mutual worship of conscious grace. I fear that
these Germanic gyrations tend to political tergiversation, for if a
Minister can in any sense turn his back upon himself, it must surely be
when his polished pumps are in a figurative whirlpool.
The Teutonic heresy has, however, gained so firm a footing among
all the educated (dancing) classes, that I almost despair of making
any" converted revolvers" by mere expostulation.
What say the fair unconverted revolvers in their defence P They
contend that a Ball-room is a fine field for ball practice. And mark
with what proud pleasure the flashing victors look back as they quit
the scene of conquest, and secretly count the number of the slain.
"How," they archly demand, "could such triumphs be achieved
without flying artillery?» Very truly your»,
High Elms, Belletgrove. WHITE POLE.
Consequences of a Neglected Education.
MBS. MALAPROP, who was bom within the sound of Bow Bells,
hearing that MB. LOWE meant to take off some duty or other that had
to do with hail, remarked that she hoped then we should have beer
cheaper.
OUR SOCIAL CIRCLE.
IT is calculated that in less than forty years the inhabitants of
London will number nearly seven millions, and its circumference
extend to something like two hundred miles. If one's circle of ac-
quaintance be, increased in like proportion, what fatiguingly long
journeys one will have to undergo in the interchange of visits! To
pay a round of morning calls, one will well-nigh have to start off in the
middle of the night, and noon will be at latest the time when one must
set out for an evening visit. It is hard work even now for a man who
lives at Hampstead to call upon his friends in Camberwell or Clapton;
and residents at Hammersmith are sadly apt to grumble and consider
themselves martyrs, when dragged out to a dinner at Blackheath or at
Hackney. But only fancy what hard labour will people be condemned
to, when London has extended from Wimbledon to Windsor, and from
Brompton peradventure even down to Brighton! Imagine the delight
of a man who lives at Kensington when summoned to an evening party
in the suburbs—somewhere, let us say, in the neighbourhood of Rei-
gate! Then perhaps people will think of wisely limiting their visits
within reasonable bounds; and who knows but in time they may even
dream of dining with their next-door neighbours.
A VERY UNFAIR COMPARISON.
MR. BERNAI, OSBORNE asked MR. LOWE on Wednesday, "Whether
he intended to put the urchin who frightened away crows from a field
on the same level as the gentleman sportsman who went out with
three or four breechloaders apiece to shoot pheasants in a battue."
The comparison would be most unfair. The urchin is at least doing
something useful; earning honest wages by honest work. The highest
light in which one can set the battue-shooter is that of an amateur
poulterers' man, who finds the killing part of the business so pleasant
that he goes in for it at an unlimited cost of gunpowder, game-keepers,
and demoralisation.

Tc reason with MB. ISINGLASS—I mean my husband—on
inch a subject would be perfectly ridiculous, and therefore, Air. Punch,
I address myselfj to you, knowing that if you cannot entirely adopt my
views, you will admit at least that there is some force in my arguments.
MR. ISINGLASS is so wedded to his cigar and his evening paper, that
nothing will startle him but a violent hail-storm on the conservatory,
or an overture by my dear Mamma on our new piano. If I tell him
that something ought to be done in Parliament, he merely says "ha!"
and if I remark that he, as a Man, ought to see it properly effected, he
simply says, " ho!"
The subject on which I desire to address yon. Mr. Punch, as the
Head of a family, is Cab fares. How very absurd it is to call a Baby a
"person." (Person, you know, in a Parliamentary document sweeps
everything before it, but a Lady in the house carries no weight at all.)
Yes! and for a baby we are to.be charged three times, as much as if it
were a small parcel! That is the thin edge of the wedge. What do
you think of having to pay extra for every infant of whatever age f For
instance. I am caught in a shower of rain half a mile from home. I
have with me—1. ADOLPHUS; 2. FREDERICK; 3. PEBCY • 4. GEORGE;
5. Baby and Maid. What will it cost me for my ride P 3s. Cxi., unless
I am very much out in my calculation.
I only mention this, not that I am much concerned about it in a
pecuniary sense, but as illustrating how unlit Parliament is to legislate
tor married people. The truth is, I believe that a very large majority
of the Commons (three-fourths or even three-fifths) is composed of
single men, who never dream about small socks and shoes, and who
consequently never introduce a measure that will embrace them. Do I
therefore advocate female suffrage P Certainly not. That would
aggravate the evil—we should then have a Parliament consisting
entirely of tall black-whiskered bachelors.
No! My scheme is very different. I would not dictate to a consti-
tuency, nor bias them in their choice of a Candidate. But I would
insist on every single member, as soon as elected, pledging his honour to
MB. SPEAKER that he '^engaged, and if he continued independent for three
calendar months, he should no longer have a seat in the Assembly.
Mamma quite concurs with me in reference to this highly essential
mode of testing the domesticity of Honourable Gentlemen, and expresses
her earnest desire to see it in operation as soon as possible.
Toleration is all very well in its place, but toleration for those who
have no.incumbrance, she candidly confesses she has no patience with it.

The handles are just as hard to turn, and as apt to stick, the panes. •
In short no sign of change do I see in four-wheeler or in sho'ful:
The bodies are just as ramshackle, and the linings just as woful:
The drivers just as ragged, and ready to cheat or abuse me,
And their habit of taking short-cuts as certain to queer and confuse me.
A WOMAN'S RIGHTS AND WRONGS.
WHATEVER, we may think of the ladies' claims to Electoral privileges,
there can be no question as to their full right to the spoils of victory
when they face our selfish sex in fair fight, and beat as.
This, Miss MART EDITH PEACHET ñas done at Edinburgh, coming
out as one of the first four students of chemistry, and as such claiming
one of the Hope Scholarships.
This claim DR. CRUM BROWN resists on the ground that the lady-
students at Edinburgh, being taught in separate courses and classes,
are not " students " in the sense that entitles them to the money-prizes
of the University.
And yet Miss PEACKEY has been awarded one of the five medals
given to the five highest students of the Session!
The University Senate has confirmed DR. CRUM BROWN'S decision.
TITUS SALT, Jun., of Saltaire, very fairly, as it seems to Punch, pro-
tests against this in the Unies, and asks those of his fellow-men who
feel that an injustice has been done to a woman by our sex, to help
him to raise a fund to support Miss PEACHET through her curriculum,
as the income of the Hope Scholarship would have done.
Bread and salt ought to go together; but in this conflict of opinion
between Спим and SALT, Mr. Punch votes with SALT.
A "Sweet Miss PÍACÜEY"—it is a very pretty name for a g^irl-
graduate with golden hair, and calls np a vision of a cheek like a ripe,
melting peach "the side that 's next the sua "—deserves this repa-
ration at the hands of oar brutal sex; and we shall be glad to see
the appeal of SALT followed by a liberal contribution of what Norwich
electors call " Sugar."
The Police Helmet.
"In answer to MR. MORRISON, MB. BRUCE said that some alight change
was to be made in the policeman's helmet. It was proposed to get rid of the
projecting comb, and the new hat would not be much lees serviceable and not
much more unsightly than the present bat."—Parliamentary Report,

THE Card-sellers, who, by the new Budget, will in future not be
required to take out and pay for a licence, are unanimous in pronouncing
Mi. LOWE to be a regular trump.

ART-CULTURE FOR CRIMINALS.
SCENE—A Club Room. WHITE and BROWN.
While (conning over newspaper). Hooray! Robbery with violence got
a hundred and fifteen lashes yesterday in Newgate.
Broten. A hundred and fifteen f
White. Yes; divided, however, between five ruffians. (Heads.)" BUCK,
HURLEY, and BRTAN, received twenty-five lashes each, and the other
two prisoners twenty lashes each."
Brown. Still the adequateness of a flogging much depends upon
elbow-grease. If the stripes were laid on with a vigour and a will,
twenty or twenty-five a-piece were perhaps enough, to make those
gentlemen sorry they were cruel, and will very likely have the effect
when they are let oat of prison and penal servitude, of making them
remember not to be so again.
White. Yes. In the meantime the expediency of gentleness in
plunder will probably commend itself to their associates at large._
Brown. From their example F Perhaps. But their example is not
made so much of as it might be. Their associates out of gaol, cannot
hear them howl, or see them writhe. Imagination is a faculty not
active amongst the criminal classes, and they form a dim idea of the
punishment they don't see.
White. It has been suggested that ticket« of admission to see
garotters flogged should be issued to their friends.
Brown. Few of their friends would trust themselves Inside of a prison.
And private flogging may be thought a corollary of private hanging.
While. But, 1 say. I '11 tell you what might be done. You know
that convicts now have to be photographed. Photograph garotters
ander the lash. Whenever a villain is flogged for robbery attended
by violence, let a photographer be engaged to attend and take his
likeness.
Brown. Seizing, of course, the most favourable moment, when the
expression of the sensations excited by the oat-o'-nine-tails has culmi-
nated in his face.
White. Exactly so. The cartel de visile or vignettes thus taken
could be multiplied for distribution to those whom they might affect.
Brown. Aids to imagination.
White. Some of them might be enlarged by the process which has
been applied to the pencillings of popular artists.
Brown. To a size big enough to fit them for being posted on the
walls.
White. So that every rascal who runs may read.—
Brown. The natural language written in the contorted features of the
criminal yelling at the whipping-post.
White. There would be a useful extension of the idea of Sun-
pictures of scoundrels.
Brown. Such portraits would be works of Art which, diffused amongst
the masses, would indeed tend to elevate the truly lower orders.
White. Send the idea to Mr. Punch.
Broten. Ask him if he doesn't call it a happy thought, and will recom-
mend it to the attention of his friend BRUCE F
(Scene closes.)

SPOTS ON THE SUN.
A VERY near approach to perfection is made in MR. LOWE'S Budget;
but what will be the effect of the following Resolution F—
"Eesolved,—That, towards raising the supply granted to Her MAJR8TT,
there shall be granted and paid on and after the 6th April, 1870, upon a
licence to be taken out annually by every person who shall use or carry a fire-
arm of any description, or any air-gun, or any other kind of gun, from which
any shot, bullet, or other missile can be discharged, the sum of П."
A pop-gun is an air-gun, or if it is not an air-gun, anyhow it is
another kind of gun. Though a shot or a bullet cannot be discharged
from a pop-gun, there is a species of missile that can. Therefore, as the
foregoing Resolution stands, every pop-gun is subject to a £1 duty.
A sixpenny cannon is unquestionably a Kind of gun whence a small
shot can be discharged. Accordingly that same duty will also be
leviable on a sixpenny cannon. The effect of these arrangements most
be to disarm the infantry.
To Prevent Disappointment.
THE bills displayed at the various Underground Stations, bearing
upon them "Metropolitan Railway," "Open Free," and "Easter
Holidays," may have spread a belief that by an unexampled act of
liberality on the part of a Railway Company, passengers by the Metro-
politan line will be conveyed for nothing during the whole of this week.
To dissipate such an extraordinary delusion, it is as well to observe
that the words " The South Kensington Museum" also occur on these
attractive bills, and that "Open Free" has reference to it, and not to
the very convenient and useful Metropolitan Railway.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FIREARMS FOR THE FEW.
О MR. PUNCH,—Sir, please
I should be much obliged
to you if you would speak
to BOB LOWE, and get him
to withdraw that gun-
licence, which will prevent
me, and most other boys,
from enjoying the sport of
red-wing and fieldfare shoot-
ing at Christmas. \
L and some more of us
fellows read about it in
the Times, and it quite
bowled us over, but we
couldn't help laughing to
see how readily the Mem-
bers of Parliameat voted
for it, because the gun-
licence is to be put on in-
stead of the game-licence,
which will be two pounds
a-year in the pocket of every
one of those Honourable
Gentlemen who shoots. Of
course the shooters are in
a great majority of the House of Commons. How jolly for them
out on the moors in August, and the stubble, and turnips, and
cover in September and October! No wonder they passed the gun-
licence in such a hurry.
But I dare say MR. LOWE won't care about offending us boys so
long as he pleases the country gentlemen. So it 's no use your telling
him to consider us, but what you might say which he very likely would
attend to is this, that his gun-licence won't make up for his game-
licence. It will only have the effect of taking away chaps' guns.
There 's myself and my three brothers, we go shooting m the holidays,
that is we used to, but shan't be able any more if we've got to pay a
pound a-piece for gun-licences. Of course the Governor won't be able
to stand it, as being a professional man without much tin, he never
could afford a game certificate. So, please Sir, just you point out to
old BOB that his gun-licence will only make a hole in the taxes for the
good of nobody but landlords and squires, and will be a precious great
bore to all schoolboys, and a good many grown-up people. I remain,
Mr. Punch, your affectionate reader, SMITH SEN.

'Тнв MUSICAL TIMES."—A clock that chimes.
OUR ESTHETIC MINISTEE.
IT must be with agreeable .surprise, my dear Mr. Punch, that ycu
will peruse the following observations on the subject of music,
made to a deputation by a member of Her Majesty's Government.
The deputation came from the Regent's, Victoria, and Battent« Parks'
Sunday Band«' Committee to complain of not being permitted to play
dance-music in the Royal Parks. The Minister told them they were
allowed to pla/ music in the Parks under certain condition«, and—
"One of those conditions wM that they were not to perform a description of
music which was disagreeable to the ordinary visitón to the park, and he was
informed that danoe-mueic wu. Moreover there was plenty ef lively music
which was not of that description. Their object should be to elevate and not
degrade the national taMe. There was no objection to their performing the
national melodies with any variations they pleased, but it certainly was never
the intention of the composers to degrade them into dancc-muiio in the shape
of quadrilles, waltzes, or polkas."
The spokesman of the deputation, MR. R. M. MORRELL, had said>
on behalf of the Sunday League, that :—
*' They considered it above all things necessary that they should perform
lively and not heavy, dull music, and were at a loss to know what objection
there could be to the performance of quadrilles founded on the national airs."
He meant, apparently, to say that, inasmuch as the national airs
were " heavy" and " dull," it was thought necessary by the Sunday
League, for the public recreation, that they should be rendered
"lively " by being turned into dance-music. Concerning this method
of dealing with music of the grand and solemn kind, which is what
unspiritual and piggish-minded persons call "dull" Mid "heavy," the
Minister, in continuation, informed them that :—
"The custom wa! commenced by M. JULLIF.V, who, he considered, did a
great deal of harm to the national music:, and greatly vitiated the public
taste."
Being asked by a MB. PALMER, a gentleman whose ears are mani-
festly rather long than musical, to define dance-music, the Minister
replied :—
"Dance-music was perfectly well known to musicians, and they must have
one to conduct their band. They certainly would not be allowed to select all
the dances out of operatic selections, and perform them under the title of
operatic music. In dance-music he included the whole category of polkas,
waltzes, quadrilles, and all sorts of hurdy-gurdy niusic."
And now, Sir, who is this Member of the Government who has so
much of music in his soul as to be able to make remarks about it in
the high spirit which pervades those I have laid before you? My dear
Mr. Punch, you will be no less delighted than surprised when I tell
you that it is no other than MR. AYRTON.
Surely, Sir, we may now suppose that, when the CHLKÏ COMMIS-
SIONER OF WORKS said that he was not an edile and not a gardener,
very likely he ww only joking, and might in the same humour, and would
perhaps have said, if he had likewise had occasion to say, that he was
not a composer, and couldn't play the fiddle. After what MR. AYRTON
has said about dance-music as contradistinguished from music proper,
I must, however, for my part, conclude that he is not merely an
edile, but an edile comparable to AMPHION. I shall not wonder at all
if the CHLEP COMMISSIONER OP WORKS should produce a work which,
under the denomination of an " Op.," will one night be performed by
HERR JOACHIM and his associates at the Monday Pops, ora symphony
that may be played at the Philharmonic after one of BEETHOVEN'S.
Believe me, my dear Mr. Punch, yours truly delighted in making a mis-
construed man of taste and refinement the
AMENDE HONORABLE.
P.S. Perish the suggestion that he was coached for the nonce.

(Said the Giant.)
"MADAME ARABELLA GODDABD has left for the Continent. American
journals express a great desire that she would visit the United States."
MB. PUNCH seldom interferes with a lady's arrangements, but on the
§ resent occasion he begs leave—takes it, in fact—to express a great
esire that MADAME ARABELLA GODDABD would not visit the United
States. As for the Continent, it is too late to grumble; but had we
known of her intention, we should have taken the liberty of serving
a ne exeat on her. We are not clear that we cannot demand her back,
under the Extradition Treaty. Perfection in Art has its duties as well
as its rights, and MADAME ARABELLA. GODDABD'S first duty is to
Punch. Who, in her absence, is to play BEETHOVEN and MENDELSSOHN
to him in the way his soul loveth? Who is to convert his grand piano-
forte from a box of (possible) music into a living and singing thing F
He doesn't pause for a reply; for if anybody said anything but
"Nobody," it would be bad times for that adventurer. If, however,
this trip is merely an affair of a holiday, after a detestable winter, and
much artistic work, gloriously done, Mr. Punch will say no more,
except that he is rather a ready hand at peremptorily telegraphing.
But as for the United States—not if the President undertook to send,
in return, a receipt for the Alabama claims, and a douceur to Mr. Punch
of all that was made by the Erie Ring in tue days of the gold-jobbery.
"GODARDUS, whence the GODDABDS, was seated in England before

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GREAT MEETING IN THE CITY.
A MEETING of Uncommon Councilmen was held the other morning
in the Court of St. Bride, for the purpose of considering the condition
of the City, with the view to taking measures for its general improve-
ment. In virtue of his endless efforts towards this object, Mr. Punch,
Uncommon Councilman, was by acclamation voted to the Chair.
In opening the pro-
ceedings, the Chair-
man remarked that
he would not insult
the understandings
of his audience by
presuming they were
capable of compre-
hending any but the
very simplest argu-
ments. London was
a big place, that was
a big fact. (Ilearf)
But by the time when
he had published his
Four Thousandth
Number, which great
event would happen
in less than half a
century hence, Lon-
don would be more
than twice as big as
it was now. Every
one, of course, would
want to come into
the City, for the
Punch Office was
there. (Hear!) What
then were they to do
for the Coining Мал,
or rather for the
Coming Millions?
аышажлхЬтпь-
i.ER suggested that
the Lord Mayor
ought to take a leaf
fromM.HAUSMANN's
book. Let the City
be polled down, and
built eleven stories
high. Sweep away
Cheapside and fleet
Street, and St. Pauj's,
and open a wide
boulevard from the
Strand slap to the
Bank. (Hear!) Temple
Bar might be re-
moved, say to the
Crystal Palace, and
kept as an antiquity
under a glass case.
ALDERMAN FOGY
would protest against
such atrocious senti-
ments. Storey soup
or wire», as he used
to say at school. Let
them stare at their
old streets as long as
they were living, and
let the coming milli-
ons look out for them-
selves. (Applause.)
As for touching
Temple Bar, they
might as well pull
down Gog and Ma-
gog, or Guildhall!
ALDERMAN GOBBLER concurred with the views of the last speaker.
If they introduced French boulevards, they next would introduce
French bottillon in place of turtle-soup. (Seaiafion.)
ALDERMAN GOAUEAD observed that, as ground had grown so pre-
cious in the City, new streets should be constructed a-top of one
another, and the City built in platforms like the decks of a big ship.
Captive balloons might be attached to the top platform, in order to
relieve the pressure underneath. (Question !)

ALDERMAN Рятшкт said that, owing to their insufficient area, the
City streets now killed pedestrians at the rate of three a week. He
feared, as men grew more enlightened, the Corporation would be held
responsible for this, and he quailed at the bare thought of being sent
to Newgate, on a charge of wilful manslaughter through over-crowded
streets. (Mentation.)
ALDERMAN TWENTYSTONB remarked the streets were safe enough
for him. He had not the slightest fear of ever being driven over, for
the fact was, as they
well knew, that he
never walked a step.
(A laugh.) Still the
overcrowding was
certainly a nuisance.
It often took him
twenty minutes to
drive along Cheap-
side, and, as time
was money, he reck-
oned the delay cost
him a fi'-pun* note.
ALDERMAN RAN-
TER observed that,
if more room were
wanted, they might
as well pulldown a lot
of the old churches
which had lost their
congregations, now
that nobody remained
in the City on a Sun-
day; or, if they ever
did so, seldom went
to church. (Ques-
tion !)
ALDERMAN E.AT-
TLECASH remarked
that what theywanted
was more railways.
Now, he had in his
pocket some half-
score of prospectuses
of lines that were
projected, some to be
suspended far above
the chimney-pots,
and others to be tun-
nelled underneath
the streets. Every
scheme, it had been
calculated, would pay
twenty-five per cent.
(oh! oh.') and it was
expected this per-
centage would be
doubled by the open-
lag of branches,
which, as they all
knew, were always
found to pay. (A
voice, "Walker ! ")
As he hoped his civic
friends would largely
profit by these pro-
jects, he would be
(Cries of "Hookey!"
"Don't you wish it.'")
ALDERMAN HEAVI-
siDES considered they
had had enough of
railways, and espe-
cially underground
ones, which he
thought were regular
bores. (A laugh.)
The City would soon be not safe for men of substance. The ground
was everywhere so tunnelled that it was a mercy if, after a good dinner,
one didn't tumble in. (Shudders-)
A discussion here ensued which promised to be interesting and prac-
tically useful; but the Chairman opportunely proclaiming it was lunch
time, the real object of the Meeting was discussed extremely eagerly
in an adjoining room, and the farther consideration of the subject was
adjourned until next All Fools' Day.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
THE CEY OF THE COMMONERS.
Ho, Wandsworth to the rescue! Ho, Clapham to the front—
Ho, Wimbledon! Ho, Tooting! Ho, Streatlmm, share the brunt!
EARL SI-UNIT.«, the devourer of Commons, opes his jaw,
To swallow suca small fragments as yet have 'scaped his craw.
By cantle after cantle he has cribbed the broad domain
Where once the cows of Commoners grazed o'er the unfenced plain.
Till with Prison and Reformatory, with coal yard, Church and School,
A wretched, ragged remnant's free from brick and mortar's rule.
Furze, fern and broom are banished; black pales shut in the sward:
Buch, grove and poplar clump give way to the builder's hideous
hoard:
And perky villa residence, or flimsy six-roomed row,
lu still encroaching ugliness around the common grow.
So benevolent of purpose,'so open of his hand,
IM rather that his Lordship had been of his own land;
If he wanted to rçive sites for Schools, and ground for prisons thus,
J.d libitum, he might have given, so he had not plundered us.
There 'a Рввк will give his thousand, if his neighbours raise their
four,
To fight the cause <>' the Commoners, and down-trod rights restore:
While a rough and ready regiment—whose acts I don't excuse—
Will pull down CORTKKEB'S palings, in defiance of the blues!
But as 'tig better to appeal to law, than law defy.
As the Court and not the Common is the place the cause to try,
Come forward with your money your Commons to defend.
Stout Wandsworthites and Claphamites—and fight to the oilier End!
HOUSES AND THEIR TORTURERS.
SOME sharp pieces of granite, labelled "Instrument« of Horse-
Torture in the Nineteenth Century," were displayed at the last Meeting
of the Royal Society, and were stated to be specimens of the material
in usage now for mending London Streets. It is devoutly to be wished
that at the next meeting there could be shown a fragment of the heart
of a Vestryman, which would probably exhibit a granitelike formation,
for the man who kas the heart to lame poor animals by scattering sharp
granite in the roadways must have a heart as hard and «tony as the
granite he throws down. As a matter of geology the exhibition would
be interesting, but as we never heard of a heart-broken vestryman,
there may be a difficulty in making the display. Now that the Royal
Society have taken up the matter, they perhaps may be disposed to
take up a few vestrymen, with a view to their indictment for the cruelty
to animals they occasion by their stupid way of mending London
streets.
; SHADES OF ROMAN OPINION.
A CONTEMPOBABY'S correspondent, watching the Roman Council,
writes word that :—
"There are now in Rome a number of devout ladiei, enthusiatU either for
the ultrai or the liberale, and their opinions are easily recognised by the
principle« of the bishops who frequent their houses. Theie matriarchs of
course tear each other s fair fame to pieces with more fury than Ultramontane
or opposition orators display in their antagonistical diatribes in thu Council
Hall.A
Theology is not the only subject which ladies can be enthusiastic
about, though they know nothing. At the late Oxford and Cambridge,
Boat-race nearly every female spectator who could afford a ribbon wore
either a light or dark blue one, according to her preference of this or
that beat of learning. The Ultramontane ladies at Rome, and those of
the other side, might display their partisanship, respectively, by analo-
gous decorations. Say scarlet and pink.
RED-НОТ MURPHY.
THANKS to Free Trade, we have no longer any riots about the price
of bread: but though, happily, Bread-riot« are things of the past,
MUKFBY riots, unhappily, are things of the present. Mot that the riots
are connected with Murphies, or Irish wall-fruit as potatoes are popu-
larly termed; but they are occasioned by one MCBFHY an Irish I'rot us-
ant", who goes about lecturing against Popery, and by his lectures,
wherever he goei, excites the Irish Roman Catholics to fury and
violence. He has lately been giving intemperate lectures at Woolwich,
where, as usual, he got mobbed and assaulted, and forced to fight, and
has, in short, occasioned the usual Murphy Riots, which had to be
quelled by the Police.
It is perhaps a pity that MURPHY'S Roman Catholic fellow-country-
men should get so enraged with MURPHY as to want to maul him. If
a MURPHY tells lies against their religion, couldn't a DOXOVAN be put
up to confute him, and turn him into ridicule? Perhaps, however,
MURPHY annoys them, not, so much by any lies which he may possibly
tell, as by saying things which are too true, and ought not to be
named. The greater the truth the greater the scandal, and conse-
quently the libel. The only way to silence a fellow, who is not ashamed
to employ such disgusting arguments in controversy as MUBFHY'S, is
by force. There is no law which prevents him from using such argu-
ments': therefore the other Irish naturally try to take the law into
their own hands against him, and execute on MB. MUBPHY the justice
decreed by JUDGE 0'LYHCH, of the Secular Arm.
LACONIC EEFOBM IN PABLIAMENT.
\V n have much pleasure in expressing an earnest hope that the
Easter Recess has been turned to account by Ministers in devoting
their leisure to the consideration of the best means of getting through
business in the House of Commons, and expediting the work of useful
legislation. Our trust is they have discovered that the most promising
way to attain this end is that of themselves setting the example of
compressing ajl the speeches they must needs make into the smallest
compass sufficient for the statement of facts and arguments bearing on
the question in debate; and therefore intend to set that example.
It has very probably occurred to MR. GLADSTONE that, if every con-
siderable Member of Parliament is to talk a long pamphlet whenever
he gets upon his legs, the Irish Stew will indeed be as much as the
Legislature will get through this Session, whilst the other great article
of Diet before the House may prove an Education Hash. Our excellent
I'H KM i r u is also as likely to have bethought him that Her Majesty's
Opposition cannot be expected to desist from the loquacity which
obstructs Her Majesty's Government unless the Chief of that Govern-
ment and his Colleagues take the initiative in cutting it short.
If our sanguine anticipations are happily verified, the dry details of
future Budget«, for example, will be laid before the House of Commons
in the very fewest words requisite to explain them. When the upshot
of a financial statement lies in announcing the reduction in this direc-
tion rather than that of a pennyworth in the pound, or so, of taxation,
what is the use of delivering a discourse about six times as long and as
dreary as the prosiest of all prosy sermons? For every Budget is a
bore in the degree of taxation which it imposes. One Budget may be
less of a bore than another, but it is still a bore, and the less that is
said about it the better. We confidently expect, then, that MR. LOWE'S
Budget for next year will not only gratify as his present one has grati-
fied us with a large remission of taxation, but also with a more than
corresponding abridgment of the eloquence wherein such reliefs are
usually proclaimed. In that case it will be constructed on the model
of an ordinary speech from the Throne (except as to grammar); not
much exceeding the average of Royal speeches in prolixity. Bit dot
qui cito dat. The Financial Minister doubles the boon which he an-
nounce« briefly.
There is, to be sure, one thing to be said for the great waste of
carbon which orators in the House of Commons burn out of their
lungs; and of aqueous vapour which they exhale in enormous quantity
together with carbonic acid gas in every discussion. Whilst beneficial
legislation is impeded, vexatious legislation is impeded likewise;
Sabbatarian legislation and Teetotal legislation: and if a massacre of
innocents occurs annually, so does a massacre of imps. That certainly
is some comfort and compensation. But the imps had better be mas-
sacred without the innocents, and the progeny whose merit is above
mere innocence. It will be a feather in the cap of the Statesman who
shall lead the way in correcting the tediousness of debates by enlivening
them with brevity, and thus inspiring discussion with the soul of wit.
Will not that feather be a becoming substitute, in the way of embel-
lishment, for a coxcomb F
Happy day, shortly about to arrive, when the Collective Wisdom
shall cease to be known by it« much speaking!

COULD not MR. Cota v and MR. NEWDÏOATE be brought to agree
in some arrangement for ascertaining the truth about Convente without
offending or insulting any one connected with them P If so, political

What is the papers doin'?
To rob a poor cove of his beer,
And bring him to his ruin.
What! make the turf respectable,
Against us chaps to shut it!
Sooner than that, I says it flat,
The Turf, indeed! I'd "cut "it.
What! horses to be growed up strong
Ere at a race you'll sport one;
And courses lengthened—go a-long—
Just let 'em go a short one.
"Improve the breed!" what 'orrid stuff,
It makes a party grin;
Improve the speed 's my motter, boys,
And let the best horse win.
Not larrup colts! a pretty go,
Why, what are folks afraid on P
Why 's horses born, I 'd like to know,
Unless it 's to get "laid on."
And when they 've landed pots of tin,
For backers, and for owners,
They didn't ought to flinch when sent
To knackers and to boners.

Poor coves like me and you,

As our sooperiqrs do.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HUSBANDS AND WIVES.
KEFORM YOUR WINE-BILLS.
MR. PUNCH has been rashly attempting the desperate feat of taking
an Easter holiday, and, considering the multifarious public duties that
call on him, may even be said to have succeeded.
In this rush after rest and recreation, he chose the Lakes for his
happy hunting-ground, and in four days of the brightest Easter weather
recorded in the memory of the oldest inhabitant, managed to cover a
large space of that lovely region of mere and mountain, doubly con-
secrated by Nature and Poetry.
He leaves it to other pens to sing the beauties of pikes and passes,
lakes and vales. Are these not written in the verse of WORDSWORTH
and WILSON, and the prose of BLACK and MURRAY P Mr. Punch's
business is with the Hotels which rise in the trail of the tourist, till
this Lake Country is completing its likeness to Switzerland by a
system of inns at once statelier, showier, and more commodious than any
to be found elsewhere in England. Of these houses of entertainment
and their charges, on the whole, Mr. Punch does not feel called upon
to complain. On the contrary, he much doubts whether any part of
England can show a better ordered set of hostelries, more honest and
attentive hosts, civiler waiters, cleaner bed-chambers, airier and loftier
sitting-rooms, better spread breakfast and dinner-tables, richer cream,
fresher eggs, stronger tea, hotter and bntterier toast, choicer trout,
juicier mutton, and generally more satisfactory arrangements in the
way of lodging and eating.
Only one thing he must protest against and wonder at.
Why, when lodging and eating are so well and wisely cared for. is
drinking treated ш a fashion at once so stupid, so short-sighted, and so
dishonest?
At not one, or at only one, of these hotels, where Mr. Punch was so
perfectly well lodged, well fed, and well waited upon, could he with
any comfort or satisfaction arrange what he should drink at dinner,
when once he swerved from the safe but narrow track of soda-and-
branay, or pale ale. Everywhere he came upon wine-bills, with a pre-
posterous array of ports and sherries, at prices from GJ. (" very superior")
to 16*. (" of exquisite quality "), champagnes from Moet and Chardon,
at 10». fid., to Vezernay at 8i., and clarets, from Lafitte at 10s. to St.
Estephe at 7». 6rf.; and so forth. Only at one place—the Prince of
Wales's Hotel, on the shores of Grassmere—loveliest of sites and best-
appointed of houses—let the fact be recorded at once in consideration of
its rarity and "pour encourager les autres"—did become upon a Me Joe
at 3»., a fairly-priced, and drinkable dinner-wine. Everywhere else his
only choice was between B. & S. or Bass, brandied ports and sherries,
horrible to the educated palate in such weather and on such an excur-
sion, vin ordinaire, such as at home he drinks for 2i. a bottle, dis-
guised under high vintage names and a corresponding high price, or
champagne, worth, at the outside, -k. a bottle, at more than twice the
money. Why is this? Why will not these people keep a stock of sound
cheap wines, at prices which, while giving a fair tradesman's profit
would yet allow the modest traveller to order them without the painful
sense that he is calling for liquor considerably worse than he is in the
habit of drinking at home, at a price about five times as high?
Why. in hotels like the Windermere, the Low-wood, the White Lion,
the Salutation, the Royal Oak, the Borrowdale, and the Derwent-
water, must my friendly, nay cordial, feeling towards host and hostess,
waiter and chambermaid.—all redolent cf Cumberland and Westmore-
land honesty, kindliness, and good faith—be dashed by the sense of
swindle which comes of these preposterous wine-charges—the sole blot
of unreasonableness and dishonesty on a scale of pnces and a system
of management which in all other particulars seems to me eminently
reasonable and honest P I have not yet ceased to wonder at this appa-
rently ineradicable vice of English hotel-keeping. The stupidity is so
palpable. Look how it checks consumption. It is not that I should
grumble about givinç a high price for choice wine. But I dp not wish
to be obliged to drink choice vintages when my purse dictates via
ordinaire. Still less do I wish to be made to pay vintage price for
unmistakable Gladstone. There is no want of sound cheap wine in the
market. Let my friends aud hosts of the Lake hotels go to Ms.
DESMAN for his White Keffesia; or to MONS. DUPUIS for his Mont
Ferrand; or to HEDGM & BUTLIB, for their Capri, or their lighter
growths of Burgundy, Tuscany, or the Garonne: or to MAX GREGER.
for his Hungarian Erlauer and Voslauer. Let them have a tariff and
a cellar of plain wines at from ¿i. to 4s. a bottle. White and Red
Burgundies and Clarets, Rhenish, and Greek, and Italian growths—
humble but honest—such wines as refresh without heating, and stand
admixture with the reaming seltzer or soda, or hardly less sparkling
water of the lake streams.
Mr. Punch will answer for a quick draught, and a handsome profit.
As it is, not one traveller in ten drinks wine in these places: or if he
does, drinks it grudgingly and under protest—or, worse still, in a spirit
of rivalry and ostentation, such as seemed to prompt the guests at our
Easter Sunday's table d'hote, where every other party ordered cham-
pagne with their soup, following the lead of a Manchester swell
"stinking of money;" while the intermediate parties who could not,
or would not, emulate this daring flight in the way of "liquoring up,"
sneered and whispered contemptuously, till what with ostentation on
the one side, and annoyance on the other, the Sunday's dinner seemed
poisoned.
The only party which seemed to escape either contagion was a group
of four wise men, who had discovered the 3i. Médoc—miraculously
present in this one cellar—and stuck to it.
When and where, among all the Hotel Associations, Limited, will
there arise a Hotel Association limited to bounds of common sense
and fair tradesman-like profit in its wine-tariff P
RYE'S BABY-FARMING.
Miss RYE has found homes in Canada for the first batch of seventy
neglected children rescued by her from a future of crime and misery in
this country, and announces that she has a hundred more homes ready
for the next hundred. This form of baby-farming at least we can
approve.
Rye-bread ought to be sweet, doubly seasoned, as it is, by the benevo-
lence of her that rescues and those that receive these poor little waifs
and strays of humanity. Other promoters of emigration look to it to
reclaim lands: Miss RYB turns it to a nobler purpose—to reclaim
lives.
Mr. Punch is tempted to parody the old song for the occasion, and
to ask,
"Will a body meet a body coming with Miss ETE?
"Will a body house a body? Will a body try?
Almost Too Much, of a Good Thing.
WHEN SACHEVERELL HÜMBERSTON came away from a visit to the
interesting collection of Chinese and Indian Art at the rooms of the
Burlington Fine Arts Club, he declared there were so many objects in
one particular kind of stone to look at, that he felt quite fatigued—
indeed he might say positively jaded.
A SHOOIEK'S ILL.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKL
FAREWELL TO THE NEW FOREST.
(ВГ AJÍ "OLD BADGER.)
AD Majores, ad Majores!
To my famers I am bound.
May I go ere yet the glories
All have gone from English ground.
Ere yet Mammon reign sole master,
flowers and verdure all have fled,
Ала the meads, with brick and plaster,
In their lieu, are quite o'erspread.
For this isle which, blithe and blooming,
Merry England used to be,
Is another land becoming,
Land of Philistines to me.
Daily I see disappearing
From its changed face some old ckann,
Here a factory chimneys rearing,
There laid out a model farm.
Friend, that Nature's foes abhorrest,
Hark, they hare bf gun to cry,
"Fell, enclose the wild New Forest,
Turm it to a Peckham Rye,
Go ahead all bounds o'ersteppmg
To achieve Material good,
Make that Forest ev'n as Epping,
Make it like unto Combe Wood."
What if, te Шаг fathers going,
They, not as I go to mine,
Back be turned, their spirits flowing
Into forme of sordid swine,
And be then, to make them fonder
Of that Hampshire forest fair.
Turned in Л-itumn forth to wander
Grubbing mast and acorns there?
Not as hogs опт fathers wandered
Through the woods, in spirit fed.
SHAKSPEARE'S value have you pondered,
Business men of pudding head?
England, in her days of beauty,
Grew a race of nobler men;
England ne'er will, drear and sooty,
Look upon their like again.
Ad Majores, ad Majores!
From the ruin soon to come,
Woodlands piled with civic storeys,
'Mid them many a crowded slum,
Through increase of population,
Which will cover each square mile,
When a great progressive nation
Has outgrown a little isle.
"THE EARTH HATH BUBBLES AS THE WATER HAS."
THE Daily Telegraph, in commenting on the increase of fish in the
Thames, regrets the appearance of an alligator in its clarified waters,
and alarms its readers by hints of possible horrors of an amphibious
and unwelcome nature. Perhaps we shall have the hippopotamus
puffing up the Thames like a steam-tug, and crocodiles maybe tempted
to try their luek in the immediate neighbourhood of the Houses of
Parliament. Sharks, whales, and sword fish we may confidently ex-
pect, and dolphins and sea serpents are not altogether improbable.
Unfortunately, however, it turns out that the poor creature was simply
a large lizard escaped from a menagerie, and the one great event in
the boatman's Ufe is denuded at once of its importance. The savage
alligator softens down into the gentle lizard. No matter, it has served
it» purpose, it has swelled the hopes of a toiler of the—river, it has
enabled a sensational writer to produce a picturesque leading article,
and it has given an opportunity to the thoughtful observer of life to
make the following remark—never be too sure that the ugly monster
)f a mystery you may fancy you have unravelled is the amphibious
lorror termed an alligator; for how frequently it turns out on closer
examination to be as harmless as MB. JAURACH'S li/.ird.
ALL CLEARED IT.
MRS. CHITTERBY says she knows all about the Spots on the Son, for
ter little CHARLEY has just been vaccinated, and is doing beautifully.
VAKIETY IS CHAEMING.
MB, PUNCH,
WHY are women unfit to have the suffrage? Because they
are. A woman's reason ought to satisfy women.
Not my view of female emancipation is that above expressed, Sir.
It is the view, mostly, of my political adversaries. On many points
MBS. FAWCETT, I am afraid is one of them; but I side with her as to
the constitutional rights of women. These, however, appear to me to
rest on rather different grounds tham those whereon she claims them.
The objection that women are unfit to exercise the elective franchise
because they are intellectually inferior te men, MRS. FAWCETT, in her
Dublin lecture the other day, maintained was, whether true or false,
irrelevant to the question. She demanded :—
"ИИ were proved as a fact thtt » u»m were intellectually inferior to
mea, »hould that exclude them from the franchise? Suppose black-haired
men wem prwved intellectually superior to red-haired meu, would that be a
sufficient гемеа to deprive red-haired шеи of the franchise, or would red-
haired men be satisfied to relinquish their right» in that respect?"'
Now, Sir, I go farther than Ми. FAWCETT, and hold that, the
intellectual inferiority of women to men being assumed, it constitutes
a special reason why they ought not oaiy to'.be allowed, but also to be
emoouraged, to vote for Members of Padieent. Every man of us
almost, above a beggar in station, and in intelligence exceeding an
idiot, is a voter. Tbe number of fools, therefore, who vote according
to their foily must be very great. But и foola differ in their politics
according to their prej udices, one fool's tote neutralise« another's. Now
there are great moral differences between men and women, and if the
latter ace intellectually inferior to the former, insomuch that generally
considered, with a few exceptions, such as MBS. FAWCETT, and your
wife and daughter», Sir, they are absolute fool«, the addition of their
folly to the constituency of the counter would be necessarily attended
with a large addition of feeling opposite to that which the male fools
are impelled by. The female fool», therefore, had they votes, would
balance the male, and their blind bet beautiful instincts would pro-
bably give a preponderance to the right side. Accordingly a few fools
•tore added to the free and independent electors of the United
Kingdom, a few more soft persons of the softer вех, would give no
alarm, but on the contrary afford some reassurance to your ancient
Custlereagh Cottage, Eldon Отеле. Тжив BLUE.
FRENCH MODISTES AND FRENCH MODESTY.
FRENCH ladies are reputed to have gcod taste in dress, but here is a
French fashion which we hope no English lady will have the bad taste
to follow :—
"The low square cut corsage now in vogue, which has come to be disres-
pectfully styled the étalage, consists of little elee than a mere band of cerise
velvet, bordered above and below with blonde lace, which with a rose posed at
each shoulder suffices to form the sleeves."
What is called full dress is often barely decent, and ladies when most
dressed have commonly least clothing. They who practise such expo-
sure as is hinted at above deserve to be exposed to the severest form
of censure. It is not enough to say that they are barefaced, for it is
not their face which is the front of their offending. A cut at them in
Punch is castigation they well merit; but were Punch to represent
such women as they are, and as they ouçht not to be, Punch might
cease to be regarded as a decent publication. Want of decency, the
poet says, is want of sense; and no one but a fool would deem herself
dressed properly, with a shred of lace, two roses, and a little scrap of
relvet.
THE NOMINATION NUISANCE.
WILL anybody tell us what earthly good there can be, excepting to
he beer-shops, in having nomination days as preludes to elections F
Voters .who can read the addresses of the candidates may well cry,
'What imports the nomination of these people F" And voters who
:an't read can hardly be much edified by the speeches which on these
.ays are mostly made in dumb-show. The show of hands leads usually
e the sho'w of fists, and the mob-leaders who beat each other black
md blue do little good by this display of their electioneering colours.
Uld nuisances die hard, and electioneering nuisances are, perhaps,
¡specially tenacious of existence. Still we hope to live to see all
lomination days abolished, and candidates elected without calling one
another names, which is commonly the case on days of nomination.
A NAME OF ILL OMEN.
PERSONS who are subject to fit« of toothache, and do not wish to be
eminded of their distressing malady, should avoid going down Long

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MR. PUNCH, who usually composes cúrrente cálamo (as Ais compositors
know, and rejoice not in that knowledge) owns to having paused for
some fractions of a second between writing the above heading, and his
revered name.
For when you have expected a friend at the beginning of February,
and he never appears until the end of April, it is customary for him to
offer some slight explanation.
But stories are better than 'an explanation. Most people's stories,
however, require explanations. [Hence dinner-parties are now so
dull]
There is a Kentucky story about a lad of sixteen, who was com-
manded by his father to go out, one wet night, and fetch a log for the
farm-kitchen fire. He did not much like the errand, and grumbled.
Now Kentucky fathers are in the habit of administering paternal
rebuke ш phrase that at all events is not open to the charge of obscurity
of meaning. This Kentucky father opened the door, signed to his son
to go out, and explained to him with exceeding clearness that he had
belter not come back without the log. The youth went forth, but not
to the woodhonse. It occurred to him that he would go and see the
world. He went, saw men and cities, worked, and filled his pockets
with dollars.
Ten vears passed, and the stout boy had become a stalwart and
bearded man. Perhaps somebody mentioned a log, and he recollected
that he had heard the word in youth. Anyhow, it occurred to him
that he would со and see his parents.
They were still in the old farm-house, and as he approached it, at
night, he saw through the window that his father was just sitting down
to supper. Seizing np a vast block of wood, he heaved it to his great
shoulder, and opened the kitchen door.
"Who are you, stranger, and what do you want P" said the old man.
"I'm JOHN, father, and I 've brought that log you sent me for."
"Well," said his father, after looking at him steadfastly, "you 've
been a darned long time fetching it, I will say. Now put it down, and
eat your supper."
Parliament met for the Session on Tuesday, the 8th of February.
The Sovereign, like one of her most faithful subjects, was unable, from
indisposition, to take part in the proceedings of that day, and the
Speech from Ihe Throne was read by LORD CHANCELLOR HATHER-
LEY, author of the Continuity of Scripture (MURRAY). It was thought
to be rather too full of promises, especially as those who framed it
knew the garrulity of Parliament. Mr. Punch, with his habitual keen-
ness and felicity, pointed this out in a memorable Cartoon, in which
MR. GLADSTONE, Head Cook, was apprised by MR. BRIGHT (assistant),
that one Dish, Irish Stew, was about as much as would be got through.
Self-praise is called in an idiotic old proverb (proverbs are nearly all
idiotic) no recommendation. This is trash, if self-praise be uttered by
one who speaks only the truth. Mr. Punch is truth itself, and merely
adds that at this date, Easter being passed, the dish of Irish Stew is
not only about the only thing that has been discussed (except LOWE'S
"bag-pudding," which wasn't half so praiseworthy as KINO ARTHUR'S,
though the " blameless King" stole the barley-meal), but the Dish is
not half empty yet.
As for rattling the now dry bones of the debates on the Address.
Mr. Punch would perform the feat, if he thought that anybody could
be, as POPE says,
"Pleased with a rattle."
But not believing that such a person exists—"there is no such man (or
woman) it is impossible " —he prefers proceeding to the work of
"tickling with a straw," or any other implement which may seem
suitable. Those debates, however, were lively at the time, LORD
CAIRNS solemnly charging the Government with having encouraged
crime in Ireland, and MR. DISRAELI, in gayer fashion—let us say
Perfunctorily—giving similar agreeable intimation of what his party
pretended to believe. The PREMIER was accused of having taught the
Irish tenant " wild anticipations" about the Land.
When the said tenant came to perceive the arrangements proposed

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
by MB. GLADSTONE, in the Land Bill, the Irishman, so far from finding
any wildness there, would пате quoted COWBER, if he had ever heard
of that bard, and said
"Their lameness is shocking to me."
In a splendid speech of three hoars, the PREMIER, on the lath of
February, introduced his Land Bill. What it was when laid upon
that table, Mr. Punch, aided by the luminous address of MB. GLAD-
STONE, could have told pretty clearly. What it is now, after two
months of debate, Mr. Punch declines to say. It was the first of the
omnibuses which MR. BRIGHT (unfortunately still too ill to attend the'
House) had said could notjbe driven through Temple Bar six abreast. At
present it sticks in Committee of the Commons. Generally, its object
is to prevent a landlord from turning out a tenant without giving him
compensation for eviction. It clearly creates a new kind of property,
and it is held that the exceptional condition of Ireland demands a
departure from the ordinary rules of Political Economy. MB. LOWE,
one of the most politically economical of men, admits this, and has
been scoffed at for inconsistency by dull folk who cannot even compre-
bend that an exception proves a rule, far less that a person may be
educated by events out of one opinion into another. Law tribunals
are to see that no injustice is done either to landlord or tenant. As
for details, they can be 'interesting only to the parties concerned, and
they don't read Punch. The Second Heading of the Bill was carried by
453 to 11, and that is the best answer to anybody who wishes to know
whether some such measure is wanted or is not. Since that time the
Bill has been in Committee, and there has been vast talk on details.
Little progress has been made, but the PREMIER has announced that
he means to carry the measure unmutilated, аз regards principle—or
not at all. He has a majority of 120, or so.
About a month later, a strong Coercion Bill, for Ireland, was intro-
duced. It has been so lucidly explained and so magnificently illustrated
by Mr. Punch, in Cartoons, that he need say nothing here, except that
if the powers of the Act (it speedily became Law) are vigorously used,
Irish Fenians and Agrarian Murderers will be in the pleasant condition
of the English Habitual Criminal. LORD SALISBURY thought that it
would not be efficacious unless we did away with the necessity for
unanimity in juries; but that suggestion stands over for future con-
sideration, if necessary. Of course, there is no magic in the number
twelve, or in any numbers, except Mr. Punch's. This Coercion Bill,
strong as it was, obtained a vote of 425 to 13 in the Commons.
Of course, the most important measure of the Session is the Educa-
tion Bill. It was introduced by MB. FORSTER, in. a most admirable
speech. Against this measure Bigotry of various kinds has fulmi-
nated; but rational men, who have long called for a law that shall
compel Education to be administered to those who are growing up
untaught, can see no valid objection to the scheme. It violates no
rights of Conscience, but it asserts the rights of Society. We will not
have a multitude of children brought up in ignorance. We are wronging
them—wronging ourselves. Against this, sectarianism of all sorts,
clerical and dissenting, brings no argument, but is not ashamed to
confess a cowardly terror lest its own position should be damaged. The
PREMIER has not spoken very hopefully of the chances of passing the
Bill, but Mr. Punch trusts that the majority of 120 will be freely used
in the interest of the children of the humbler classes.
The remainder of the topics which have occupied Parliament is
"nought but leather and prunella ;" and as nobody understands those
words, Mr. Punch quotes them in sheer gaiety and wantcnness of
heart. If, as somebody has suggested, "leather" means aristocracy,
and " prunella" plebeianism, each being an accident, and native Worth
(not the English Parisian milliner) being independent of either, that
meaning (Рорв never thought of it) will do as well as any other. For
a bit of aristocracy, here is the fact that the Conservatives in the Lords
could not find a Leader. The new li.ua OF DERBT is too calm to be
a dashing champion. LOUD SALISBURY is also too large-minded for
the place: and then he is not a devoted admirer of the author of
Lothair. LORD MALXBSBURT prefers fighting in the ranks, and others
also prefer that place for him. LOK« CAIRNS'S health is not strong
enough for troublesome work. So the sensible and business-like
DUKE OF RICHMOND is now the Conservative Leader in the Lords;
and if he fights no brilliant battles, he will make no absurd mis-
takes.
We have had the Estimates, and to the honour of the Ministers in
charge thereof (and of their subordinates, of whom nobody hears) vast
savings have again been made in national expenditure. Needless to
say that the details of many of the savings have been cavilled at
savagely. But so it would be in any household in which economy was
adopted for the first time: Mr. Grundy would abuse the salt-butter,
and Mn. Grundy would make faces at the cheap claret.
MB. PETER TAYLOR urged that Members of Parliament ought to
receive wages. MB. GLADSTONE demolished him in first-rate style.
But if a constituency wants a man, and he is too poor to sit, unpaid,
there is no law against a subscription to support him. Only his income
ought not to be below £5000 a-year. Any man with a shilling less
than that, the millionnaires think would be open to a £10 note from a
whip, or to the sweet influences of a card for his wife and daughter
when a political great lady gives a party.
The Wellington Monument in St. Paul's is to be finished—some day.
Punch has promised his daughter, now twelve, that if she marries to
hi« satisfaction, and has a son, grandpapa will take the dear boy to see
the inauguration.
Being told that MR. BBIGHT had promised the Spaniards that he
would give up Gibraltar to them, and then being asked whether this
were so, MB. GLADSTONE said that he had not had an opportunity of
communicating with MB. BRIGHT, but believed that he might say no
sack promise had been given. And he replied as gravely as if he had
been repeating the Ninth Commandment, which folks who write
untruthful paragraphs should get by heart.
Ma. NEWDEGATI carried a Committee for inquiry into the manage-
ment of Convents and Monasteries in England. Hie success has given
the utmost offence to the English Catholics, men have protested on the
platform, and ladies in the papers. The earnestness of both has been
more respectable than their logic. Mr. Punch hopes, however, that
some pacific arrangement will be made, and the bigots on both sides
be left out in the cold, lie would be happy to be the sole Inspector of
Convents, and to make his own report, and he is certain of being
welcomed, no one extant having done to mach for Catholic liberties—
as distinct from licence—as FATHER PUNCH.
Lastly, the Budget. That is a thing of the other day, and you all
know all about it. MR. LOWE takes off the Abyssinian Penny from
the unjust Income Tax, and half the Sugar Duties. Newspapers, from
October next, are to be carried at the rate of a Half-penny for Six
Ounces. Air-guns and other Firearms are to pay £1 a-year. A heap
of small impositions go. Do you like big figures. He takes off nearly
Four Millions of Taxes, and has about Three Hundred Thousand
Pounds in hand. He will not reduce the National Debt, as Posterity
has not u yet done a great deal for us.
Mr. Punch thinks that he has "Eaten his Sapper" like a gentleman,
and drinks all your good health« and your families, and may they live
long and prosper.
A LIVE SEA-SEEPENT.
WHAT is there better than an enormous gooseberry when in season,
that is, during a political lull, when Parliament is up, and people are
out of Town f Here is something, we thought, when first we read it,
published by a contemporary on Easter Monday, which, in point of
strangeness, and in the verisimilitude of its details, much excels the
enormous gooseberry :—
"AN ALLIGATOK CAUGHT IN THE THAMES.—W. Роскыка, a waterman
of Bermondaey, came before MB. Рлктшпп Е, at the Thames Police Court, on
Saturday, and said he had caught an alligator that morning in the Thames
while rowing up the river. It was alive, but much exhausted. It is about
four feet in length. He took the creature into his boat, and conveyed it on
shore. Two young men carried the alligator to MR. J AMRACH. a dealer in
wild beasts and natural curiosities, in Satoliff Highway, who refused to part
with it. Мн. PARTRIDGE said that MR. JAMUAUU had no right whatever to
detain the alligator. He would send a police constable to speak to MB. JAM-
BACH on the subject, and if it was not restored to the waterman he would
issue a summons."
Easter Monday, we said, was the ISth of April Had it fallen on the
First, comment upon the foregoing statement would be superfluous.
Considering the length to which Reviews, and other extraordinary
notices in newspapers have usually to be extended on that holiday, we
can be at no loss to account for the publication of the surprising
paragraph we have just read.
Perhaps, therefore, we continued, it is idle to inquire how the alli-
gator found in the Thames crossed the Atlantic, or to speculate on
the probability that it escaped from some vessel importing it for MR.
JAMBACH, or for the Zoological Society. We may, however, exercise
pur rational faculties perhaps to advantage, by considering whether,
if we should be surprised at the appearance of an alligator in the
Thames, there may not have been equal reason for surprise to those
who saw the first crocodile that appeared in the Nile r Suppose an
alligator to be merely a development of a water-eft. If MR. I) AH WIN'S
theory is right, the wonder is that we do not rather frequently find
such a small novelty turn up as that of an alligator in the Thames.
The Thames alligator, we concluded, seems rather to have been
developed from the inner-consciousness of an unusually imaginative
penny-a-liner. Otherwise, perhaps, if an actually living creature, it
will turn out to be a porpoise, or perhaps an otter.
We were wrong. It turned out to be a Lacerta, not also an alligator,
which had escaped from MR. JAKBACH'S collection.

Much Wanted.
IN North Germany they have an Assembly which they call " The
Customs' Parliament." A Parliament of that sort in this country
would find a good many bad customs to investigate and correct.

ALL ABOUT NUTTING.
OUR Correspondent, a Left tenant Kernel, is
incorrect in surmising that Cob-nuts are a va-
riety of the Horse-cbesnut. The racing expres-
sion of " cracks" does nut refer to either species.
COMMODORE N VTT did not invent shell-jackets,
though the famous crackers owe their origin to
his genius. The "Nut-brown Maid" was not
composed by SHELLEY, as you seem to imagine,
and .the phrase "a nutter failure" need not of
necessity apply to the fact of finding it a bad one.
Yes. certainly, there is a town named Knutsford,
in Cheshire, bat it is principally remarkable for
the thick heads of its juries, which may possibly
explain your confusion as to nuis. What you
say about "cracking the Gordian nut" we attri-
bute to your ignorance or the heat of the weather,
also your observations on the opera of the NiKze
di Fígaro, which are unworthy of you, and if the
singer in question did exhibit too much of the
"voce di testa" (we pass over your remark about
"detest her" and so on, because, really—) or
"nutty flavoured" voice, there are some, remem-
ber, who like that sort of thing, and who instead
of the liquid "ut de poitrine" prefer a good
strong heady whine. However, for all further
information we must refer you to Nttttatt't
Dictionary.
Queer Taste.
"ASK your grocer for the London tea."
Remembering our suspicions as to the seat of
the manufacture of a good deal of the tea sold
in the Metropolis, this is the very last article we
should think of asking our grocer to supply.
"DE TE."-What the "thoughtless husband"
said to his family — "I don't think much of
you."
THE FOUNTAIN OF HONOUR Ш FEANCE.
TEE Paris Correspondent of a contemporary mentioned, the other
day, that the EMPEROR or THE FRENCH had honoured the races,"
that is to say, had attended them.
But when a Sovereign honours a horse-race, how does he honour it?
By condescension or by homage? Does he honour it as he would
honour a tailor by noticing him, or as he honoured his father and
mother f
Horse-races are honoured by some men with an honour amounting
to veneration. They attend them as festivals of horse-worship. Lou is
NAPOLEÓN has always shown devotion to the horse.
But if we are to understand that when his Imperial Majesty honoured
the races, he honoured them simply with his presence, and by setting
his eyes on them, we must suppose that he confers the same honour on
everything he takes in hand. What a number and variety of tilings,
then, he must honour in the course of the day, from the time of his
getting up in the morning to that of his going to bed at night!
The first thing which he honours is perhaps his wash-hand bason, by
pouring into it a quantity of water, unless he is accustomed to com-
mence his ablutions at once with the tub. Or, unless he first honours
his tooth-brush by plunging it into a dentifrice, and using it.
He then honours a cake of soap of some description, which may
possibly be yellow. Very likely he next honours a sponge, and, after
that, a rough towel, or, may be, a pair of horsehair gloves.
Having honoured, as he learned in England to honour, all the requi-
sites for a practice which by too many of his countrymen is more
honoured in the breach than the observance, NAPOLEÓN THE THIRD
proceeds, probably, to honour his socks and drawers by putting them
on. In the same way, of course, he honours his under-waistcoat, if he
wears one; likewise his shirt, his trousers, and his slippers. At this
point, very likely, he honours a razor (for his cheeks and chin are
apparently shaven), having previously honoured the other appliances
necessary for shaving, inclusive, perhaps, of some advertised " euxesis"
or " emollio." In the meantime he must needs have honoured a piece
of shaving-rag or paper, and may have honoured a strop.
The next appurtenances of the toilet honoured by the EMPEROR OF
THE FRENCH, presumably, are a hair-brush or pair of hair-brushes and
a comb. Moreover, it is not impossible that he may honour some
quantity of bear's-grease or pomatum, not to say hair-restorer.
When he has honoured his hair by the act of arranging it, if he does
not honour a hairdresser with the office, he honours his necktie, if we
rightly conjecture, and, that done, honours his waistcoat, honouring
lastly his dressing-gown or lounging jacket. By this time he doubtless
finds it necessary to honour a little more soap-and-water with manual
use, likewise a nail-brush.
There are a few other matters that he may have honoured besides,
or will honour shortly, and, before he walks down to breakfast, it may
be that he honours his boots, which a footman has previously honoured
sentimentally in cleaning.
At the morning meal His Majesty, we hope, heartily honours certain
eggs, rashers of bacon, bloaters, sardines, cups of tea, coffee, or choco-
late, and at the same time never fails with his perusal to honour Punch.
Of course he honours some other journal.
Further specification of the many material objects which the Ruler
of France, as well as every other monarch, is accustomed and obliged
to honour daily might be tedious.
A Busy Han.
MUCH has been written about the division of labour. Bat, accord-
ing to one of the papers, a remarkable instance has just occurred of
the accumulation of labour. A gentleman has been appointed to the
office of Pro-proctor in the University of Oxford (not a sinecure), who
is also a Master of Arts, in Clerical Orders, a Fellow of His College,
and " Assistant Secretary to the Board of Trade "!
Brothers and Sisters.
MR. NEWDEG ATE'S opinion of the monastic institutions, respecting
which he proposes inquiry, implies no great veneration for St. Benedict,
and the other saints who bunded the principal orders. MRS. MALA-
j'Kor might truly say that Benedict is no saint in the Newdegate
calendar.
DOUBLE ENTENDRE.
WE read in a Liverpool paper that in Bonny the mothers of twins
are "drammed" out of the town. Of course the tat-two is played on
the occasion.

MACBETH NOT DOGBEERY.
МАГВЕТН, MACBBTH, MACBETH! Had you three ears you'd hear
me? You have only two ears, but those two would be thrice as long
as a Macbeth's should be, if you were capable of the utterance which a
newspaper ascribes to you. What is that P Braying, MACBETH, Pro-
vost MACIÏETH; expressing yourself not as Macbeth, but ш Dogberry.
Worthy MACBETH, what a shame it is that you should be so miare-
ported by some dreaming reporter, as you must have beea in the
Glasgow Herald! In that journal it is stated that yon. and your
brother Magistrates held a court the other day at Rotheaay, when
deputations from branches of the Free Church, a Total Abstinence
Society, and a Parochial Board, prayed your worships for a reduction ¡u
the number of public-house licences, and called your attention to the
fact that billiards and other games were being introduced into hotels
and public-houses, and declaring that they held the tendency of those
amusements to be pernicious. The report of your proceedings contains
the incredible statement that—
"The PBOTOST, on behalf of himself and brother Magistrates, ezpreoed
their willingness to keep down the number of licensed nooses, if at «11 pos-
sible; »nd with regard to a billiard table which had been introduced into one
of the hotels, indicated that they were quite willing to allow it to be used by
strangers lodging in the hotel, or by strangers visiting them, but that they
could not tolerate its uee by people living in the town. With regard to
dominoes, draughts, &c., being used in public-houses, he said the Magistrates
would not grant licences uniese these instruments of gambling were removed,
and a promise given not to introduce them,"
What a rage I should have been in had I been a Provost, and had
seen in print such nonsense put into my mouth as the Glasgow Herald
has made you talk about billiards! For many people, inclined to
believe rather than to doubt the truth of any imputation of folly to
others, would not suspect the story that I had uttered that nonsense
to be a hoax. And, if I had uttered it, what a donkey I should have
been! Billiards objectionable in a hotel! Why, who can play at
billiards drunk P Sobriety is a necessary condition of the game; and
as to billiards in a tavern, so far from their having any pernicious
tendency, the billiard table must tend to divert frequenters from the
beer-engine and the bottle. I should also feel highly indignant at
being represented as having been such a fool as to talk about dominoes
and draughts аз though I confounded the games so called with hazard
and blind hookey, not even perceiving, in my dense stupidity, that
those recreative draughts were likely to wean all amused with them
from those other draughts that make men drunk. To write down
MACBETH, as the Glasgow Herald has virtually done, that which Dog-
berry requested to be written, is too bad. It may suggest a bad joke
to some one of your countrymen—the riddle why is Provost MACBETH
like Macbeth's castle P which of course you know was called Dunsinane.
But no, Provost, ye 're na that inane dunce that you have been made out
by the Glasgow contemporary .of
Down with, your Dust.
WHY will not ME. ATKTON water Rotten Row as nicely for the five
o'clock as the one o'clock equestrianism P Among five hundred other
sufferers, Mr. Punch, whose duties to his country detain him at his
office until the later hour, has lately been half blinded on more than
one occasion while taking there his needful exercise ere dinner. With
the barometer at Set Fair, each fair lady who may sit by the side of
Rotten Row gets as dusty as a miller, in the absence of Aquarius.
Will our B-^idile kindly take pity on her chignon, and bid his water-
carts at five o'clock to do their work like one o'clock P
Fact.
A MONSTER who was present at the opening of the Vaudeville, and
whose coat he declared was spoiled, said when going out, "Well, it
may not be remarkable for its size, but it 's unpleasantly conspicuous
for its paint." If MR. MONTAGUE remunerated this person he made a
great managerial mistake.

doubt a small catalogue would sell without interfering much with the

Neither is it likely that many catalogues the fewer would be sold if the
Academy would have the pictures lettered each with its subject and
artist's name, as in the National Gallery. Turning out the number of
picture after picture distracts the attention grievously, and in many
cases turns the head giddy. I can answer for one, and hope the Royal

been perpetrated in Greece. Save as matter of record, the frightful
story would not find place here, for every Englishman and English-
woman is acquainted with the facts. Travellers—ladies and gentle-
men—visiting Marathon, were set upon by brigands. The ladies were
released. Ransom and pardon were the demands of the brigands.
Both would have been given, but for the conduct of the Greek Govern-
ment, which displayed imbecile pedantry and mischievous violence.
The miserable end was, that four of the travellers—three Englishmen
and an Italian—were murdered. No. not the end, for there is a heavy
account to settle with Greece. For the moment, let us gladly pass from
a horrible story. It is due, however, to our own Executive to say that
¡t exhausted every endeavour to save the lives of the victims. And a
word for the manly conduct of the young KING OP GREECE, who acted
a* became the brother of one whom England loves dearly.
The Commons proceeded with the discussion of the Budget, and
assented to MR. LOWE'S Stamp propositions, so the reduction on
newspaper postage is a fact—or rather will be, for the present system,
like the tippler,
"Lies in October."
The War-Office arrangements are to be hugely altered. MR. FIELDEN
did not admire the new plan, and like the House of Commons in the
famous ballad which tells of Silly Taylor,
"Declared 'twas & Eegular Job."
But the House, dividing 80 to 6, majority 74, declared that it was
nothing of the kind, and the Government champions, MESSRS. CARD-
WELL and STANSPELD, insisted that the responsibility of the War-Gods
to Parliament would be increased by the change. It is needless
for Mr. Punch to say that his want of confidence in the present war-
system at home is Absolute, and that, while no created party exceeds
him in his admiration for the chivalry of the British officer, or for
what SIR CHARLES NAPIER proudly calls "the Majesty with which
the British Soldier fights," be is much too often reminded of a mordant
verse, forming part of a poem written (no one shall ever know by
whom) in Crimean days,—
"' His heart is with the brave
Whose glorioue banner» wave
Where, pointed on Sebastopol, the cannon roars,
And he knows they only fear
The foeman ill the Bear,
The Blunderers at Home/ says the Barber out of Doors."
Passing from martial considerations to panperdom, the House then
read a Second Time a Bill for improving tne means of Believing the
London Poor. But the subject (not that Mr. Punch derides temporary
makeshifts, if they are necessary) must be dealt with in a very much
larger way. The scandalous fact is, that with all conceivable machinery
for treating poverty, and a perfect Pactolus of golden ointment ever
flowing to keep the works in order, we have a state of things which
would be disgraceful to a nat ionjlmt, had never heard of Political Eco-
nomy, and which is a black, dismal, and overwhelming shame to a
nation that reads MILL and PUNCH.
Nextly, by way of making things pleasant, we departed from con-
sidering how money is used foolishly, and addressed ourselves to expe-
riences of its being used criminally. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, which
his name is SIR Копнит COLLIER (these explanations will be found
convenient a few hundred years hence), moved the Second Reading of
the Bill for abolishing Bridgewater and Beverley,/>ro criminil/us. Of
course the measure was opposed, but the disclosures had been so per-
turbing that Honourable Gentlemen could not find much to say, and
we had the old story of the instruction to counsel—"There is no de-
fence to this action, but please to abuse the plaintiffs attorney." It
was urged that the Commissioners—on the strength of whose report
Vot, LVIII.—187Q.
No. 1504.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
the fatal sentence went forth—had been very unkind, and occasionally
тегу rude to parties concerned, and witnesses. No doubt they were
so, and most properly. A light, however, is thrown upon the sentiments
of sundry persons of highest "gig respectability," when it is actually
made matter of complaint that there is anything like harshness in the
treatment of bribers. What a row would be made if an ordinary
prisoner in the dock should "flare up " (why has that good old bit of
abominable vulgarity gone out f) because his witnesses had been tor-
tured by MB. CHAFPANDBRASS. or any other gentleman whose avoca-
tion it is to get the truth out of those whose predilection is for telling
lie*. Yet which culprit is the worse, he who punches an enemy's head
and throws his property out of window, or he who spreads corruption
and demoralisation (nice word, that) over a whole population f We
could pursue this theme, with a lavish display of virtuous indignation
and well-selected adjective, but other people can do that (and don't
they, eh P), whereas Mr. Punch prefers to be the inimitable.
"There is no one beeide him and no one above him,
He standest alone, ав the nightingale singe."
[If any questionable grammar be found in one of the above lines, it
is the fault of the poet for originally writing " thou," and manipulating
his verb accordingly, but .)//• Punch apologises to Miss ELIZABETH
PHILP, whose rendering of the beautiful words has stamped them perpe-
tually on his memory.] The opponents of the Bill had to withdraw
their amendment—in fact, anything like amendment is entirely apart
from Beverley and Bridgewater—and the Bill was read a Second Time.
Also, similar progress was made in the measure for inflicting a similar
castigation on certain Norwich voters. For indeed
"The 'Man in the Moon'
He rose too >oon,
And aeked the way to Korwich,"
and somebody was indiscreet enough to give him the information which
he desired. Whereby, consequences were disastrous. Let that be a
warning against Early Rising—also bribery.
Observe that in Committee of the whole House leave was given to
bring in a Government Bill for Abolishing Religious Tests in the Uni-
versities—and Colleges. It is, say its enemies, a more sweeping Bill
than any previous Reformers dared to ask for, and contains everything
that all of them have asked. This is an undoubted merit, and let us
hope that the fact will occur to the House of Lords. Mr. Punch tole-
rates no Tests except such as are used, for the benefit of mankind, at
a certain temple in Albemarle Street, and in the laboratories of the
high-priests of that Fane.
Tuetdav. Let Suowden listen—he cannot as yet be bored with the
| accents of London tourists, ascending his " shaggy side " on shaggier
| ponies. Notice was given by MR, WATKIN WILLIAMS, who, to judge
by his name, is probably what King Henry calls "a Welsh" (the "a"
is manifestly a typographical blunder, against which SHAKESPEARE, if
I he had read his proofs like a caretul author, as no doubt he ought to
I have done, would have written dele; but it makes the passage jocular),
I that on a given day, in this month of May, he will bring in a Bill for
I the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales! We may just as well
! mention at once, while the matter is in our minds, that Мл. WATKIN
i WILLIAMS'S Bill will not become law. Asks any rash creature what
I right Punch has to say this P He replies decisively, if politely,
"By that great right the vaet and towering mind
Ha> o'er the grovelling initinct of the vulgar."
Not, of course, that he is accusing anybody in particular of grovelling
or vulgarity, for, as must have been observed, he invariably takes
care never to "give offence." (Vide Walker.) But the signal for
battle has been sounded, and already Welsh cannon on both sides are
crammed with missiles. Let the welkin roar.
A Colonial Debate in the Commons. A motion by Ma. TORBENS,
(not the excellent M.I', for Finsbury) for a Committee on our relations
with those outlying parts, was resisted vigorously by the PREMIER,
(Мв. GLADSTONE—these explanations will be found convenient a few
hundred years hence), and negatived by 110 to 67.
Wednesday. As Mr. Punch sang, years ago,—
"My sister-in-law, they're trying again
The Consanguinity Table to flaw,
And the Houee of Commons déclarée it plain
That a man should marry nit sister-in-law."
These exquisite lines indicate the occupation of the House on this day
of Woden, and probably will be enough for most persons, including
Persons. MB. WALPOLE opposed the Bill for allowing you to marry
your wife's sister, and so did MB. BERESÏORD HOPE, and SIB
ROUNDELL PALHEB; but MB. GLADSTONE gave the Bill vigorous
support. There was little of the theological argument introduced, the
ess, perhaps, that it is proposed that such marriages shall be before a
Registrar. The majorities in favour of the Bill were first 70, and
then 87.
Thvrtday. In the Lords, the Foreign Secretary, and LORD CAR-
NABVON, who is a connection of one of the victims to the Greek Govern-
ment and its brigands, spoke upon the painful topic, the former
explaining his own course, which all must see was admirable; the
latter tendering thanks for it, and urging that Parliament and the
nation "should not allow delay to dull the keenness of their present
feelings, or to abate one jot or tittle of the punishment that must be
exacted when the hour of reckoning comes." His words of manly in-
dignation will be echoed in every heart.
In the Commons some progress was made, by the Committee, with
the Irish Land Bill—Mr. Punch presumes that he need not enter into
details—at any rate he declines to do so.
Friday. The LORD CHANCELLOR (I I ATM к.ш.к.г. These explanations,
&c ) proposed to go into Committee on the High Court of Justice Bill.
He stated that he had improved it very much, and hoped that the amend-
ments would give their Lordships satisfaction. LORD ROMILLY com-
plained that he had not had time to read the improved version, which
he had received but a Í • w hours before. We cannot exactly say that
we saw him at the Private View of the Royal Academy that Friday,
but he might have been there, and if so, we congratulate him on the
good taste which led him to prefer seeing LORD 11 л ni KIU.KV, in a
clever painting, to reading him in a prosy Bill. LORD CAIRNS was
dissatisfied with the Bill, not being able to see that it provided for a
binding marriage between Law and Equity. Mr. Punch will not quote
SHERIDAN, and suppose that those parlies are already married, as they
are so seldom seen together, but will make the much duller, yet more
practical remark, that it' clever men like LORD CAIRNS keep on for-
bidding the banns, there is small chance of the couple ever being
made nappy. LORD WESTBURY thought highly of the end in view,
but lowly of the means employed. LORD PENZANCE, in urging that judges
were quite qualified to draw up rules of proceeding, paid an unaffected
but effective compliment to his predecessor, SIR CBESSWELL CRESS-
WELL, who, as should be known, did everything but codify the Law and
Practice of the Divorce Tribunal (of course we could have said Court,
but who is going to lose a sonorous word P). Finally, the CHANCELLOR,
not without a murmur, consented to allow the Committee to stand over
for a few days, but thought that the Judges ought to look alive (all
of them do, we are glad to say) and let him know their sentiments.
Did Mr. Punch mention the object of this Bill P Well, he has no space
to do so this week, but the object is, as LORD WESTBÜRY. said, a very
good one, and that knowledge ought to be enough for any right-
minded person.
An incident, which happily was harmless, marked MR. CHARLES
BUXTON'S domestic history this day. A short-hand writer, whom he
was dismissing for neglect and impertinence, fired a pistol at MR.
BUXTON, but missed him. When explanations were made in the House,
which was of course anxious to know what had really occurred to one
of its most respected Members, the would-be assassin had not been
captured; but he is hardly of the class of criminal to be long latent,
and on this side the Irish Sea we do not protect murderers.
MR. GLADSTONE, yielding to the general feeling that opportunity
should be given for a great row over MR. NEWDEGATE'S Committee
on Catholic Convents, presented the following Monday night, after 11.
He made a sort of suggestion for oiling the waters by hinting to MR.
NEWDEOATK that he would do well to explain exactly what he wanted,
so that the ideas as to dragging frightened young Catholic ladies before
a bigot Committee might be slightly allayed. MR. NEWDEGA.TB pro-
mised to expound.
A quarrel over the dismissal or resignation of COLONEL BOXER
(formerly of the Royal Laboratory) was not very amusing, and it
ended in nothing but the ventilation of the alleged wrong done to a
gentleman whose military inventions have been valuable; but there
was laughter over the case of a couple of appointments to the magis-
tracy at Leitrim,—one of the Beaks having oeen, it was said, in the
KHZ and Feather trade, and being at present, it was also said, in the
habit of weighing butter in a public market. The law has many old
rags, and reasons light as feathers; and why a man cannot weigh
butter and justice also is not clear. The Irish Secretary amusingly
declared himself unable to justify the appointment at that moment, but
would inquire further; but it was next to impossible to arrive at a
truthful relation of any Irish fact.
Some matters of no particular interest occupied the rest of the
night—i. «., till 2 20 on Saturday morning, but Mr. Punch designs
only to immortalise a smart quotation (he himself never quotes, except
from himself) by the PREMIER, Remarking on somebody's remarte
on the delay of business by talk, MB. GLADSTONE said :—
"Such discussions rather reminded him of the linei in that clever volume
the 'Bejected Addresses,' where the author speak» of people who, in the
theatre, «houted silence ш order to obtain quiet : -
1 He who, in quest of quiet, "Silence!" hoot«,
I» apt to make the hubbub he imputes.'"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEW BOOTS FOR BOBBY.
E think that the Morn-
ing Advertiser has
been doing the public
a service in advertis-
ing, for the benefit
and information of
those whom it may
concern, the objec-
tionable character of
our brave Policemen's
boots. This does
concern everybody.
That the Police shall
succeed in catching
the fugitives they run
after, all people are
concerned, except
only those fugitives
and their friends,
whose concern it is
that they shall escape
their pursuers. The
more flexible, light,
and easy, if suffi-
ciently strong, their
pursuers' boots are,
the better for the
community; the
stiffer, the clumsier,
and the tighter, the better for the pursued; rogues and thieves. At present the
Policemen's boots are of such a make as to be very much the reverse of Seven
League Boots. They are so made as if they had been made to order of the thieves,
and rogues, and dangerous classes. The ends of Justice, and the protection of
Society, would be furthered if those boots were allowed to be made to order of
their wearers. As INSPECTOR O'BRALLAGHAN says,—"Them only that wears
the boots it is that knows where the shoe pinches." An ill-booted Police is one on
just, the footing to be desired by every freebooter.
There is something very reassuring, especially at night, in what "E. A. M."
in the Advertiser speaks of as "the measured monotony of a Policeman's tread."

It is, indeed, a music like that of "the watch-dog's honest
bark." But, whilst a surety of our Protector's presence,
it is a warning of his approach. By the thick heavy boots,
in which he cannot help treading noisily, he lets the
burglar, the garotter, and the pickpocket know he is
coming as effectually as he could if he wore bells on his
helmet, or a rattle at his coat-tail.
So needful is agility for the efficiency of a Policeman as
to render it highly desirable that the Police drill should
include lessons in dancing; and the Police boots ought
accordingly to be boots in which it would be not impossible
to dance. Perhaps the Home Office will adopt these sug-
gestions. Then we may be, by-aud-by, occasionally amused
with the spectacle of a Policeman oullariug an offender and
waltzing him off in custody. Dance music might be
composed with relation to the Police as well as to the
Army, of which, indeed, the Police force is simply a
domestic branch, equally gallant, and deserving to be
equally fashionable. Let us hope soon to see "A 1
Quadrilles" exhibited in the music-shop windows, with a
full-length portrait of A 1 himself on the cover, in boots
of a description corresponding to that letter and that
number. At present purloiners, as light-footed as they
are light-fingered, can lead Bobby a dance, and dance clean
off, but they would soon be overtaken if he were taught to
dance properly, and had proper boots wherein to dance
after them, tripping it on the light if not fantastic toe.
It is desirable that the amelioration of Policemen's boots
should be accompanied by a considerable addition to the
existing number of pairs, corresponding to the numerical
increase of the Police which is urgently required to render
their presence reasonably approximate to ubiquity, instead
of, as at present, from the impossibility that a few men
should be in many places at once, apparently often being
equal to nullibity.
A NATURAL REFLECTION.
A POLICEMAN the other night was overheard remarking,
that before he went to bed he thought of a good supper as
his area pensée.
SONQS OF THE SORROWFUL.
I.-" THE GIFT OF THE GAB."
I 'M wealthy, I 'm healthy, I 'm young, I 'm admired,
1 've excellent taste both in music and art;
I can knock off a sonnet or two when required,
And in a discussion can well bear my part.
But this latter gift renders life such a bore,
That every day do I suffer a stab:
I never can hope for true happiness more,
For alas! I was born with the Qift of the Qab.
At home when the cook is in vinous condition,
And each dish is spoiled as a matter of "course,"
She comes the next day in a state of contrition.
Repentant, regretful, a prey to remorse.
My wife who should speak to the wretch—'tis her duty—
Catches me as 1 'm off to my Club in a cab,
Exclaiming, " My dear, топ must talk to this 'beauty,'
Because, love, you know you've the Gift of the Gab."
When I get to my Club, where I 'm on the Committee,
I find that JACK JOHNSON has done something wrong.
All his friends say it 's shameful, and though it 's a pity,
We must have him up. and pitch into him strong.
It was / who proposed him, I long to be out of it:
But " No," say the others, "you are such a dab
At this sort of thing, you 'те our spokesman, no doubt of it,
You shouldn't possess such a Gift of the Gab."
I break JOHNSON'S heart, for my eloquent tongue goes
Nineteen to the dozen when once I commence;
Like beer from the barrel when outward the bung goes,
And JOHNSON 's expelled for a trifling offence.
Next week in a row quite as dreadful /tumble,
They say that political secrets 1 blab
Outside the club-walls, and 1 feel rather humble
Ал folks lay it all to my Gift of the Gab.
BROWN bolts from his wife, and in Fleet Street I meet him
In tears, for he 's anxious repentance to show;
He seizes my arm, and in vain I entreat him
To calm himself—bootless—he says "Yon must go
At once! See my wife, state my case, urge it strongly"
(His wife 's a strong Scotchwoman, née Miss M'ÏAB,
Who thinks I 'm her husband's accomplice—though wrongly,)
"My life 's in your hands—you've the Gift of the Gab.""
Of course I succeed—now they 're wretched together,
But that 's not my business. I settle to go
Away for six weeks with my wife, for the weather
Is really delightfully balmy, you know.
A Charity Dinner, a dreadful affair which
I try to escape, but they manage to nab
Me just as I 'm off, "Come, you must take the chair, which
You promised you would. You 've the Gift of the Gab f"
1 go to a party, which dull p'raps a shade is,
The supper is solemn, and everything 's slow.
"Come, come, our friend JONES will propose, hem! 'the Ladies,'"
Exclaims the dull host, seeing every one low.
I 'd longed for a holiday once in a way, but
They won't let me off—so 1 lose my dressed crab:
Of course on the subject I 've nothing to say, but
What 's supper compared to the Gift of the Gab P
Ob, what would I give for a stammer and stutter,
And why such a fool could DEMOSTHENES be
To hold in his mouth pebbles, merely to utter
His sentiments rather more "slick" to the sea.
I envy those folks who when called on to speak feel
Upset, whilst they first turn deep red, then pale drab,
Their hearts palpitating, their knees very weak feel,
How blissful's their state—they've no Gift of the Gab!
Dulcet.
HALF the duty is taken off. Sugar is down in price. SACCHAKISSA
says there is a line in TENNYSCN, which all consumers, whether of
moist or lump, may now quote with peculiar propriety :—
"Sweet and low, eweet and low."

TITAN in strength, but guileless as a child;
In whom the large heart balanced the large brain;
Whose patient life, and manners plain and mild
Lessoned the fretful, and rebuked the vain.
None knew but loved the man, who seemed to grow
Only in power and passion for his art:
Not in ambition for rewards or show,
The hustling and the huxt'ring of the mart.
Who seemed above the craving e'en for fame—
Such fame as asks the trumpet of the time;
Content to work, and wait until there came
That nobler Fame, whose laurels keep their prime.
Unto his loving heart and eager soul
Pleasure came early, with her winning wiles;
few steps he followed her; then paused and stole
Beyond the magic of her side-long smiles,
To the cool Palace of the Queen he loved,
And therein ever after dwelt alone;
Uuboastful, but by loyal ardours moved,
For Art's advancement, careless of his own
Not greater the examples left to show
His power of toiling hand, and shaping brain—
WELLINGTON girt with death at Waterloo,
The Piciorpl deck, and NELSON'S dying pain—
Than is the example of a life so given
In loyallest allegiance to his ¡irt,
À strife so silently but stoutly striven,
A worship where no baser thought had part,
To times like ours, hot, hasty, full of care,
Loud, not as deeps roar, bat as shallows rave:
That prizes beauty as a market-ware,
To buy and sell, as Moslem holds a slave,
Not as a Queen, and something more than Queen,
As Queen and Saint, that hallows where she rules:
Snch was to him the Loveliness unseen,
That mocks our traders and eschews our schools.
He lived the life an artist ought to live:
Has died the death an artist ought to die,
Swift, sudden, with a hand still strong to give
Shape to the visions of the inner eye.
He leaves the name an artist ought to leave,
Of one serene of mood, of manners bland,
Unknowing to defame, defraud, deceive,
Sweet temper, open heart, and generous hand.
Jumping to Conclusions.
A SPORTING Contemporary notices a novel Cricket Match in which
the competitors were one-legged and one-armed pensionen. It con-
cludes by saying, "The game was decided in favour of the one-legged
men by twenty-eight ran»." This is, of course, a mistake; the writer
must mean hops.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE SPANISH TOAST MYSTERY.
ERTINGLY, or certainly (as some purists
affect to spell the word) nobody in
bis senses believed that the new EARL
OF DBKBY—
"Behold him here!"
(as Warwick says in a play that is not
SH.VKSPKAHK'S) committed the indis-
cretion of rising at a Roman banquet,
and proposing the health of the PRINCE
OF TUB ASTUHIAS, coupling the toast
with a wish that his roial highness
might speedily succeed KING JUAN
Рык as Sovereign of Spain. The
idea could have occurred only to some
idiotic clerk in one of the foreign tele-
graph offices, into which, enraged
editors and infuriate merchants think
(with reason) that it is the Continental
custom to insert persons of the class
more humanely taken care of in
England—say at Earlswood. The
EARL OP DERBY, with whose praises
as Foreign Minister all the journals.
Liberal as well as Conservative, rang!
He make such a blunder! He shoot
an arrow o'er the Roman house and hurt his brother statesman in
Spain! The notion was dismissed with a contempt so profound that
like Bottom1» dream, it had no bottom. LORD DERBY is a wise man,
wiser than most. He let his wisdom appear, the other day, in refusing
to become the leader of the Conservative Lords. Why should he mix
himself up in fifty quarrels, over-valued at two-pence a-piece, and
perhaps half commit himself on important questions, when there is
every chance that so exceedingly Liberal a Conservative may be asked
to return to the Foreign Office one of these fine days P With that act
of prudence in all our minds, we burst out laughing (angrily) at the
notion of his suddenly proclaiming a Bourbon.
But then who gave the toast? It appears to have been settled that
it must have been a Lord, and that his Lordship's initial was that of
the First Whig. 80 LOUD DENBIGH was selected. He had been in
Rome,—his initial is "D," and he is a very devoted Roman Catholic,
who would look unfavourably at. the results of the Spanish Revolu-
tion, if it bad any. "Au Englishman, if you please, but before all
things a Catholic, was LOBD DENBIGH'S description of himself, and
is what he will probably append to his respected name when he signs
the Census paper next year. The thing was doubtful, but then as
free-thinkers are warned by an orthodox poet,
"What can be doubted, may be true."
But LORD DENBIGH writes to say, that he петег " set eyes" (he is
not writing about potatoes) on the Prince in question, and sertingly (or
certainly) never proposed such a toast, or anything like it. Then,
who did propose it P
Mr. Punch is a deeper thinker than any one else in the world, and
he proposes,—not a health, but an inquiry,—" Was the toast given at
all ''" In the next place he would ask, what it signifies to mankind
whether the toast were given or not? Are QUEEN ISABELLA'S friends
likely to drink her son—a good youth, we hear—to a throne P That
process was tried in England, some years ago, when a Pretender's
admirers quaffed hugely; but we never heard that they got anything
by it,—except the gout. However, at present, the Mystery of the
Toast must remain unsolved; and Mr. fünf A merely adds his con-
gratulations to the LORDS DERBY and DENBIGH that they, for two,
have not done a stupid and offensive thing.
"THE UNION WHEEL."
WITH exceptionally bad taste the manager of the Sheffield Theatre
bas produced a drama called The Union Wheel, which deals with
"Broadheadism" (hiss 'em, it should have been) and other unpleasant
trade matters. The sentiments in favour of the ruffianism of the
"Union" were received with delight by the gallery. We always
thought the jurisdiction of the LORD CHAMBERLAIN extended to the
provinces so far as the licensing of new plays was concerned. If so,
where was Мк. DONNE on this occasion P Perhaps the piece was pro-
duced without his knowledge. If so, we beg to refer him to a recent
number of the Sheffield Independent, in which this charming drama is
fully described.
THE RIGHT WAY OF TAKING IT.—To liquor up is the usual expres-
sion, but to liquor down would seem to be the more correct one.
IS TIGHT-LACING DiJUBIOUS?
À MEETING of fine ladies was held the other evening at Fhillis's
Rooms, in order to discuss this interesting question. In virtue, of
possessing the most fashionable figure, her waist only measuring
fifteen inches and three-quarters, Miss WASTE by acclamation was
voted to the chair.
In opening the proceedings the Chairwoman remarked that, as her
breath was rather snort, she would beg to be excused from making a
long speech. (Hear!) Fashion, they all knew, was omnipotent with
ladies, and, now that fashion had revived the custom of tight-lacing,
as hers was only to be gained by hours and hours of actual torture.
(Sensation.) Matt il faut souffrir pour être belle; and if they did not
mind a few fainting fits at first, followed by continual debility and
headache, many ladies might enjoy the pleasure of possessing a waist
not much exceeding the dimensions of her own. (Cheers.)
Miss PINCH said her experience entirely agreed with that of the
fair Chairwoman, though, unhappily, her suffering had not yet been
rewarded by the rapture of obtaining quite so fashionable a figure.
Still, her waist barely exceeded eighteen inches and a half (shudder»);
and she hoped, by perseverance and a good strong lady's-maid, to
reduce it before long to more genteel dimensions. (Applause.)
Miss LOVELACE said she abo had suffered much from headache since
she wore tight stays, and once or twice had fainted at the dinner-table.
Her doctor had told her she was ruining her health; but she didn't
mind her doctor while she obeyed her dressmaker. (Brava !)
Miss GASPER would like to ask, what could doctors know about it?
They didn't wear stays, did they P How, then, could they tell what
ladies suffered from tight-lacing P
MRS. M. BON POINT observed that, although she tried her utmost,
she could not reduce her waist to less than nineteen inches. (" Poor
dear!") Even this, however, made her wretchedly uncomfortable;
and after eating a good dinner she was frequently obliged to have her
laces cut, to save herself from fainting. Her doctor tried to frighten
her, by talking about fatty something of the heart which often had
proved fatal. But she would rather die a martyr than dress out of the
fashion. (Applause.)
Miss WHËYFACE said she feared that by acquiring a small waist she
had injured her complexion. Her nose was getting red now, and her
cheeks were pale and pimply. Some one had told her this was owing to
impeded circulation. But she was consoled by having a fashionable Ggure.
Miss TUCKER said the worst of wearing a tight dress WHS that it
sadly took away one's appetite. Since she had reduced her waist, she
could not eat one-half of what she used to do. {¿Sensation) Now, this
was a great misery, for she was fond of eating. Still, she had rather
give up her custards than her corset. (Cheers.)
Miss GOSLING thought it was not ladylike to eat much. RuHe health
was a most unfeminine possession. A person tu be fashionable should
be always rather delicate; and nothing insured this so nicely as tight-
lacing.
Miss LAZIE remarked that another of its benefits was, that it pre-
vented any muscular exertion. To lie upon a sofa and read novels all
day long, was her idea of almost perfect earthly happiness; and, as
tight-lacing unfitted her for any useful work, she had borne like a
martyr the torture it had caused her.
Miss WANDLER said she could not walk well in her stays, they made
her feel so st iff' and wooden. But her waist looked well on horseback,
though she never dared to venture at more than a foot-pace, for her
habit was so tight that she could hardly breathe when trotting.
Miss PRANGER observed that, much as she loved dancing, she had
found it impossible to waltz in her new ball-dress. She felt so squeezed
and faint that the utmost she could do was to walk through the square
dances. (" Poor thing ! ") In consequence she had lost a number of
nice partners, and that odious Miss WuiRLER had sadly cut her out,
although her waist was nearly two feet in circumference. (Shudders.)
MRS. WISEMAN said her husband would not let her wear stays
(Seiuatioa. and cries of "What a wretch!"), and she would advise
young ladies to leave off lacing tightly if they wished to get good
partners. Men loved healthy wives far belter than small waists
(" Oracieta ffoodnest.'"), and no one but a fool would link himself for
life with a woman in bad health, however she might pride herself on
having a fine figure. ("Question!") She would propose a resolu-
tion :—
"That this meeting, being satisfied, from moat abounding evidence, that
tight-lacing is injurious to happiness and health, will do ¡u very ulmoBt to
discourage and dUcountenance во barbaroua a fashion."
Here several ladies interposing, began all to speak at once, and
hence ensued a scene of violent excitement. Many of the fair com-
batants fainted from exhaustion; and it was not until a number of
corsets had been cut, that the sufferers were able to be taken to their
carriages.

НАБ.Т) WOEK FOE HOOFS.
WE stand no longer on the old paths; we strike out new: needs
must, to make thoroughfares amid, and approaches unto, the spreading
clusters ot bricks-and-mortar and stucco required to house the ever-
growing population of this great and flourishing country. Go where
you wüT, your eyes are outraged and your steps impeded by newly
made roads. What manner of roads are they that impede rather than
assist, the steps of wayfarers P English roads. Roads, in the neigh-
bourhood of London, not Dublin or Drogheda. Roads rough with
shingle and broken granite a little more pleasant to walk upon than
broken glass. Truly does the Chamber of Agriculture Journal say of
the French :—
"They keep the best of their roads free from mud in winter and from duet
In summer, and where road materials are scarce and dear, they find a great
economy in bestowing such attention. We boast of being a mechanical
people; but our mode of forcing good horses and light carriages to grind down
broken stone is a disgrace to the nation."
No doubt this is one of the barbarisms which make foreign visitors
laugh at us, quite goodhumouredly. When they ride and drive over
our granite or shingle they ride and drive our horses. That conside-
ration only serves to render unqualified the amusement with which
they observe not only that the road before them has been mended with
granite, but also that, at the sides of the granite patch, which are
smooth, loga of wood have, with a thoughtful simplicity of contrivance,
been laid down so as to mue the horses go over it. 1C the horses ana
carriages, having to do this granite-grinding, were the foreigners' own,
they would laugh on the other side of the mouth, uttering maledictions.
They would curse the Government, meaning the Ministers, and gene-
rally cursing the wrong people, the Government of the nation instead
Df some local self-government, consisting of Bumbles.
Why don't the Bumbles send steam-rollers about their highways to
srush the granite, flints, and pebbles with which they pave them, into
¡oft powder f Because they represent the ratepayers, the majority of
whom are not of the equestrian order, and a steam-roller would swell
the rates. Would the horsekeepers and carriage keepers submit to a
horse and carriage rate P Then every district might be furnished with
its steam-roller by a smiling vestry. Centralisation could establish
everywhere the same instrument for smoothing the way of a noble
animal; but Britons never will be centralised, although the way in
which parishes repair the roads is a remarkable example of that local
self-government which LOUD I'AI.MKKSTO.V called local tinkering.
GROUNDLESS PANIC.
GREAT consternation in the kitchen, both in London and the
country. Uncontrollable excitement in the Servants' HalL Petitions
are being got up, Public Meetings are about to be held, and Leagues
will certainly be formed. A public demonstration in Trafalgar Square
is threatened. The usual Spring cleaning is generally suspended. A
report has gone abroad, and is spreading from area to area throughout
the lengtb and breadth of the land, that MR. LOWE is instantly going
to abolish" Followers!" -
(We are happy to be able to allay the alarm this startling announce-
ment has naturally caused in the breasts of the female domestic
servants of England, by assuring them that this contemplated aboli-
tion of " followers" nas nothing whatever to do with JOHM THOMAS,
or the police, or the military, or the postal force, or even the baker,
but refers solely to stamps, and parchments, and lawyers' bills, matters
which we trust and believe have no power to cause Cook and MARY a
single moment's uneasiness.)
Latest from Parie.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

LISTENEKS HEARING GOOD OF THEMSELVES.
EAR young ladies, attention to a
judicious observation delivered
hy an emiuent composer now
lecturing on the subject of
Music, at the South Kensing-
ton Museum, to large, attentive,
and instructed audiences. Mit.
ARTHUR SULLIVAN, in conclu-
ding his introductory lecture,
said :—
"It is better to be a good listener
than an indifferent performer."
Bear tbat in mind, dears.
Why are you, most of you,
taught music at all? In order
to the superaddition of a charm
to the various other charms
with which you are endowed,
that they may ultimately com-
pel some fellow to marry you.
The more permanent all those
charms can be rendered the
better. Some of them are, un-
happily, fugacious. You can-
not, outwardly and materially,
be, or be made, beautiful for
ever. But inwardly and spiri-
tually, being beautified, you
may remain beautiful for life. The music which you learn is an incre-
ment of your interior beauty. That is, darlings, in so far as it is an
interior music, a cultivated sense of music, and not a mere external
power of execution, however skilful. It is the " music in the soul"
mentioned by the divine WILLIAMS, that makes your loveliness more
lovely; and if you have that, you will be good listeners, and, as such,
better mates for any man of musical feeling than yon would be if not
such, though ever so brilliant performers; ay, better than the best
mere performers, even though yon can't play at all.
Faithfully to have learned true music reúnes the feelings, and does
not suffer them to be low, or frivolous. The wife whose feelings are
thus refined is a perpetual joy to her husband; otherwise, she is a
perpetual blister, especially if. whereas she listens not well, she performs
indifferently. And m general, dears, she can hardly perform else. At
best the nursery soon shuts up the piano. But if she be a good listener;
if she will, on occasion, sympathetically with the husband who has
taken her to a concert or the Opera, at a cost altogether, tickets and
cab-hire, perhaps exceeding two guineas, listen to HANDEL, or SEBAS-
TIAN BACH, or HAÏDN, or MOZART, or BEETHOVEN, or WEBER, or
CHEKUBINI, or, let us add, ARTHUR SULLIVAN, the result is that con-
jugal harmony of which the sweetest concord of sweet sounds is but an
expression. Finally, a good listener possesses this great recommenda-
tion to be the spouse of any sensible man, that she will always listen to
her husband.
A CAED DELIVERY COMPANY WANTED.
How we should all be blest if something could be done to expedite
the interchange of ordinary civilities! For instance, what can be more
irksome than making morning calls on folks you only care to meet as
evening acquaintances? How conversation languishes upon these sad
occasions, and what a waste of time and temper such formalities occa-
sion! How everybody hopes to hear that everybody else is announced
as " not at home," and with what relief the card-case is produced, and
a comer is turned down to show the call has been made personally!
It is not thought "the thing" to send one's card by post, or this
would be an easy way of morning-call making. But what a blessing it
would be were a company established for social card delivery, and were
such an agency admitted by society as being a correct equivalent for
calling!
To make the thing genteel, the servants of the Company might all
be dressed in livery, and for ultra-swell society they might even wear
hair-powder, for which an extra charge would doubtless willingly be
paid. Messengers on foot might serve perhaps for central and sub-
urban districts, such as Hornsey, and Woburnia, and Islington, and
Hackney; while in Bayswater, Belgravia, and other fashionable neigh-
bourhoods, the cards might be distributed in well-appointed vehicles,
which should bear the semblance of being private carriages, and in no
manner betray either their hiring 01 their use.
THOSE ILL-USED B.'S!
(Beverley ала Bridgewater,)
Мт sweet pair of boroughs, why furnish a handle
To satirical rogues in the House and the Press?
We kaum there are cases where truth must be scandal;
And you know what occurs when yon stir up a mess.
What use on Commissioners' blue-books to comment,
To prove each owns some stain from which t' other is free f
Which is best, which is worst, is a point of small moment,
When both, 'tis confessed, are as bad as can be.
When the pot slangs the kettle, who thinks of comparing
Their several blacks, to a shade less or more P
And since the Commissions gave TOUR blacks an airing,
Self-measurement surely 'twere best to ignore.
In odious comparisons waste not your labours,
Nor into your past invite England to look:
Change your tone, and contend you 're no worse than your
neighbours,
Except ш the fact that they 've brought you to book.
Don't let Beverley say, "I 'm than Bridgewater whiter,"
Or Bridgewater, "Beverley 's blacker than I ;"
But both boroughs join 'gainst the blue-book back-biter—
And the charge of exceptional blackness deny!
Declare that your colour 's the colour of money,
And that ig the colour all hustings love best;
That each borough 's a hive, where all go in for honey.
And that jou 've but been busier B.'s than the rest!
ANOTHER IRISH GRIEVANCE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
WELL knowing you have great influence with the English
people, I take the liberty of bringing before you the sufferings of a
large and influential body of the Irish nation.
As MR. GLADSTONE (God bless him !) is going to redress the wrongs
of the tinants, he ought to consider thousands of others in j ist as op-
pressed a state. I want yon to spake up for the suvants, the missuse«
are as great tyrants as the landlords. I am not axing too much. I 'm
not going in for "fixity of tenure," but why should there be "freedom
of conthract" atune the Mrs. and me, and not with the master and his
tinants, and why shouldn't we when evicted get "compensation for
improvements P" but I '11 now state my case, and that of thousands.
I hired with my mistress for £8 a-year and 6г. a week board wages.
I was to keep her house clane. Well, Sir, when I come in I find the
house as dirty аз a pig-stye, and every thing going to decay, the dust
on them walls and carpets was dhreadful. I spent my time and breath
claniug them, the rust on the fire-irons was an inch thick, now they
are as bright as new; but that 's not all. I tould yon I had board
wages, so I lived mostly on tay, and I collected every day all my own
tay hives, and spread them out on the huid—carpets I mane—till the
shamrocks that were in them come out as bright and as fresh as ever
you seen with the twigging afther the tay laves. If the Mrs. was to
call an auction to-morrow, sure and she 'd get double value now for
them; and yet afther all she gave me notice to quit yesterday, and not
a word of compensation for improvements.
Piase to tell MR. GLADSTONE, if he don't give us justice, we'll
frighten the English into giving it. There 's many a servant as has
the spent of "Itory of the Hills," and the Mrs. s desarvea to be
peppered as well as the landlords.
I am, Sir, yours respectful,
MOLLT O'REILLT,
Upper Housemaid to Judge O'HAFFERTY,
May-day, 1870. 98, Fitzwilliam Square, North.
IRISH DISARMAMENT.
Ys with whom no man, sane, his life can trust,
Disarm you, kindness can't; coercion must.
Something like a Bonnet.
WE read in that delightful organ of feminine Fashion, Le Follet,—
that the spring bonnets will have "fronts, crowns, and curtains."
Le Follet may well call bonnets with so many features of the bonnet
about them "elegant novelties!"
A LOCAL ASSOCIATION.
THE common belief it that the modern practice of cooking hone-
flesh for the table was first introduced in France; but it seems far
more probable that it originated in this country, at a place called
STEWPONT.

A. NEW DISHCOVERY IN DANCING.
Tu к French have odd ideas of pleasure.
Look how some of them were pleased to
amuse themselves the other evening at a ball
in Paris :—
"There wa> a cotillon, in which the candidate
for a partner had to fo through a stove nod put
hie head in a hole which wae cloeed by a diehcover.
The lady took off the cover, and if ehe liked the
plat, ehe ordered him up hot."
A FEW PREDICTIONS.
SOMEBODY will live to see the last price-fight, the last guinea-and-a-half novel, the last five-act
play, the last Lord Mayor's Show, the last half-crown, the last stage coach, the last lawyer's wig,
the last grand juryman, the last powdered flunkey, the last threepenny morning paper, the last
sixpenny ice, the last beadle, the last dean and chapter, the last Quaker, the last siuecurist, the
last oyster, and the last bottle of old port wine.
Somebody will live to see certain City churches pulled down, in which the congregation
averages about seven souls a service.
Somebody will live to see Army reform and the end of promotion by purchase.
Somebody will live to see the disappearance of the anomaly of Biggborough, with a population
of 15,000 people and a living of £300 a-year, and Littleton with a population of 300 people and
a living of £1500 a-year.
If not, we may suppose that the gentle-
man dishcovered would probably be dished.
Well, there is no accounting, certainly, for
tastes; but, if to get a dance we put our
head under a dishcover, we would give our
friends permission to consider us a spoon.

AWAKENED BATH.
WiDDlNe presents are, we believe, never
too late; so the gift which the Ladies of Bath
offer to the PRINCESS or WALKS, "on her
marriage," will doubtless be as acceptable at
Marlborough House as if the presentation
had been made seven years ago. In the
case of the Royal couple who dwell in Pall
Mall, there can be no awkwardness, for
their happiness is of the permanent kind.
But, on the whole, Punch does not recom-
mend imitation of the course of the tardy
Ladies of Bath. It is just possible that a
long delay might find some couples in a
situation in which presents would not be
apposite. The Mesdames Trop-Tard of Bath
give an escritoire. In some cases such a
thing might arrive just in time to be used
for the signature of a deed of separation.

SADDUCISMUS TR1UMPHANS.
A. PARAGRAPH in a contemporary, headed " Superstition in Devon-
shire" contains the following defence, addressed by an old shoemaker
named BÜRCH to the Barnstaple Magistrates, before whom he was
charged with assaulting an old woman by scratching her in the arm :—
"Gentlemen, I have suffered fire years' affliction from her. I have been
under her power, and more than a hundred people advieed me to fetch blood
of that woman to destroy the spell. I have lost II canaries, and horn 40 to 50
goldfinches; as fast as I got them they died, and I have had five complaint*
Drought upon me at once."
On hearing this declaration :—
"The Mayor said that it wag most extraordinary that such ignorance and
superstition should prevail in the present enlightened age."
In the present enlightened age persons of position in society and of
education believe that they shake hands with spirits at dark séances.
His Worship the MAYOR OF BABNSTAPLE cannot have known that, or
he would not have called the belief in witchcraft ignorance and super-
stition. If spiritualism is true, sorcery is possible, and, as there is no
legal remedy against it, old BURCH may be considered to have been
justified in taking the law into his own hands for self-protection.
Accordingly since he was fined 2i. M. and costs, and, as he couldn't
pay the money, sent to prison, perhaps a subscription to get him out of
gaol, and make him amends for the trouble he has got into, will be
raised amongst affluent and superior "spirit circles." For if one
medium can float about a room, why may not another ride upon a
broomstick P
The Greater Guy Fawkes Day.
"ALL the world," writes the Times Correspondent at Rome, "has
heard of Roman fireworks." It has. Happily, however, in the pre-
sent age, those fireworks are such as we should be only too proud to
emulate, if we could, on our Fifth of November.
TENPENCE-HALFFEIOIY per diem is offered by an advertiser in one
of last week's papers, to any lady who is willing to undertake the
duties of governess to five children and look after their "wardrobes."
She must have a thorough knowledge of English, Music, French, and
so on—we were nearly writing "sew on," for the situation seems to
combine that of a seamstress with that of governess. Those ladies
who may be on the look-out for such windfalls will feel it an extra in-
ducement to strive for the lucky berth when they are informed that
the salary is to " include laundress." There is, however, a vagueness
about the manner in which this is expressed, and we should not be
surprised if the announcement really means that the governess is also
expected to act as family washerwoman. Why not! Remember,
Ladies, the salary is sixteen pounds! You say that a good cook gets
more than that. Ah, but remember you are not asked to fulfil Aer
functions. You have simply to teach the children, English, French,
music, and of course any other accomplishments you may happen to
have acquired, and it 's tenpence-halfpenny every day in the year, re-
member, and possibly you may be occasionally permitted to see your
friends.
Suggestive of a Want.
IN his excellent speech at the Royal Academy Banquet, the American
Minister is reported as saying, that "in these classic precincts, sacred
to the arts and humanities, the voice of the turtle alone is heard." We
hope there was no omission from the menu—w trust the fat of the
turtle was also tasted.

UNBLUSHING INNOCENCE.
THE majority of British girls who
have happened to notice it, will
hare been more puzzled than
alarmed by the subjoined denun-
ciation, which occurs among the
batch of " Canons" just fired off
by the (Ecumenical Council :—
"If any one blush not to affirm
that there is nothing besides matter,
let him be anathema."
"Him," they have learned now-
a-days enough of language to
know, means "that Person" in-
discriminately. "Siquis (homo) non
erubuerit" &c., "let that homo
be," &c. By the canon above
quoted, they well understand that
they, equally with the other
homines, are told to be anathema
if they blush not to affirm that
there is nothing besides matter.
Being quite sure they have no
idea of affirming anything of the
horl¡ "^ course they feel that they
needn't mind the malediction; but
what probably they cannot make
out is what there can be to blush at in the condemned saying, and, if
there is what would once have been thought something, how anybody,
iu these days, can be supposed, even by the POPE and the Council,
capable of blushing at anything.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MAT 2, Monday. Amusing! The North Dublin Union, (whatever
Iliat may be) petitioned the Lords to dissolve another Union, that
between England and Ireland. The N. D. U. also expressed its regret
that HER MAJESTY has not a Palace in the Green Isle, and does not
occasionally reside in such edifice. LOUD TALBOT DE MALAHIDE
vouched for the respectability of these Union Anti-Unionists, and
while dissenting from their prayer, regarded it as a straw showing how
the wind blew. In old days we should have said that the straw had
been taken from the head of one of the petitioners, bat we no longer
so treat a certain description of unfortunates that they lie as Mus.
MARGERY DAW did. Repeal the Union! Restore the Heptarchy.
We have some idea that this has been said before, but the moral is the
same, which has also been said before.
À third kind of Union, the matrimonial, seems to be attended with
some technical difficulties in Ireland, which is a pity, as marriage is a
good deal encouraged by the fair daughters of Erin (the thought of
whose sweet fresh faces often stays Mr. Punch's hand when he thinks
of bringing down his shillelagh upon the sconces of sundry Paddies)
and the law is to be improved. There is no improving an Irish girl's
beauty, and Mr. Punch rejoices to know that she is generally too wise
to make the attempt.
Government intends to repeal the Ecclesiastical Titles Act. Mr.
Punch has some slight notion that Ми. NEWDEGATE and MB.
WHALLEY win have something to say to Government on this subject.
An alteration of the law has, however, become necessary in the Protes-
tant interest.
Mu. THOMAS HUGHES intimated that he should introduce a Bill for
putting down Scotch Betting Houses. Most persons will be surprised
to hear that the canny and careful youths of Scotland risk their
bawbees in wagers, and all persons will be rejoiced to hear that such
evil courses are to be stopped.
More Irish Land Bill debating. "Everything hath an end, and
that which we call a pudding hath two—your worships will forgive me
for being facetious," quo' the MAYOR OP WOODSTOCK.
Eleven being then marked on the dial, the House proceeded, by
appointment, to further consideration of MB. NEWDEGATE'S proposal
in regard to Catholic Convents. Strangers crowded to listen, for warm
work was expected. The honourable Protestant expounded (per in-
vitation of MR. GLADSTONE) his views, at very considerable length; in
fact, too long for MR. BERNAI. OSBORNS'S patience. MR. NBWDEGATE
managed, though with an intricacy and wealth of words worthy of one
of the Jesuits whom he detests (not that he was trying to be cuttle-
fishy, but the faculty of explanation is not universal), to convey the fact
that he wanted a good deal more than mere inquiry into the property of
the monastic folks. MR. WINTERBOTHAM, eminent Dissenter, opposed
the plan, as calculated to excite uncharitable feelings; and Mr. Punch
commends a boldness which may not command the admiration of all
MR. WIHTEBBOTHAM'S non-conformist friends. Further, he ridiculed
the statements that conversions to Catholicism were frequent in Eng-
land, and asked how many of the thinking sort—practical men—went
over to Koine, and whether the converts were not chiefly "women,
parsons, and peers P" MR. B. DAVENPORT was for mutual concession—
a sensible suggestion. MB. GLADSTONE regretted the vote the House
had come to on the subject, thinking that the balance of inconvenience
was against the vote. But Government, though not responsible for
the result of the discussion, would interfere in a conciliatory spirit.
He was for confining the investigation to the state of the law respecting
convents, and the terms on which they hold property.
MR. NEWDEGATE did not like this, of course; and refused to recede
from a decision which had, he said, been approved by England and
Scotland. MB. DISRAELI did not approve of discharging the order
that had been made. But on division it wu discharged, point blank,
by 270 to 160; and then on MB. GLADSTONE'S motion, (and despite
some Catholic resistance)^ a Committee was appointed by litS to 57 (a
large House) for the inquirv suggested by the PREMIER. So both sides
claim the victory, and that is always a desirable state of things. There
is nothing in the investigation proposed that should annoy sensible
Catholics; and as they have defeated the plan, if it ever existed, for
dragging reluctant ladies before a Parliamentary Committee, it will be
graceful in the witnesses who may be examined, to be as frank as
becomes Englishmen, when asked plain questions.
There is to be no Licensing Bill this year, M.M. the Publicans;
but all new Licences are to be subject to anything Parliament may
enacts mind that. The reprieve is due to the garrulity of Honourable
Members.
Tuesday. The British Naval Squadron has been ordered not to eo to
Greece, as it is not fitting that in existing circumstances our officers
should receive Greek hospitalities. Ma. OTWAY, for Government,
considered it premature to ask what the intentions of the Administra-
tion are, in regard to the recent tragedy. The Greek Government will
it is thought, provide for the family of MR. LLOYD, who "had nothing
in. the world but his wife and children." He had more—a country
whose representatives will take care that his fate shall not be forgotten.
We had a Protection r. Free Trade Debate. "Talk to me of
ADAM," said the French lady, who was reminded of something that
had happened twenty years before. Enough to say that a motion for
inquiry into the French Treaty was rejected by 13S to 50.
Wednesday saw the Triumph of Woman. Led by MR. JACOB BRIGHT,
her friends advanced, and demanded that the County and Borough
franchise be extended to females. He spoke out for his clients, admitted
that they were religious, which he seemed rather to regret (attributing
the weakness "to the mode in which they were brought up," and in,
which Mr. Punch hopes that they ever will be brought up, for a truly
irreligious woman, were she not an impossibility, would be a monster),
but urged that they were not politically ignorant. Moreover, Woman
votes iu parish matters.
COLONEL SYKES could not see that it mattered whether a voter wore
petticoats, or (the gallant Colonel named the other article), and reminded
the House that women used to vote for East India Directors, who
governed two hundred millions of people.
MR. SCOURFIELD thought a woman did not desire a vote, and would
consider it a Damnosa Ileeredilas. As all ladies read Latin now, we do
not translate, but there is a Scotch story about a tipsy barrister inter-
preting the words into an allusion to the something red nose of the
judge. You must be tipsy yourself to see the point of this piece
of wut.
MB. FOWLER said that Woman's place was home, and her business
t'he education of her children. She was also to adorn her sphere. If
"sphere" have the meaning of "orb," and "orb" have the meaning
of head" (see Hamlef), she usually does, to the best of her ability—
and, by the way, we are glad to see bonnets coming back.
SIR CHARLES DILKE explained that this Bill applied only to a woman
who was the real head of the house. A woman might be a Queen, and
a good one, yet she was not to have a vote!
MB. BERESÏOBD HOPE was evidently afraid of seeing women come
into Parliament. Also, he thought that a lady candidate could bribe,
with her tears, in a most effectual manner.
DR. LYON PLAYFAIB, as a philosopher, and therefore knowing what
women are made of, supported the Bill. There are, he said, 487,000
widows, and 1,100,000 spinsters, who ought to have the franchise.
Women did want it, though they did not pull down Park railings.
SIR GEORGE JENKLNSON thought women laboured under a grievance.
It was only those who had property that were to be enfranchised, and
women managed property much better than men.
MR. MUNTZ could not see why a lady should be deprived of that
which was accorded to her gardener and her groom.
SIR H. CROFT did not like women to intrude themselves on public
notice. He quoted Mr. Punch, who once playfully observed that the
females who wanted woman's rights wanted woman's charms—but
Mr. Punch did not mean anythingT>y what he said, and is certain that
there will be myriads of pretty electresses.
MB. HOME SECRETARY BRUCE said that this was a question which

the Government had not had time to consider, and he was not prepared
to expreß any opinion on the subject.
The Previous Question having been moved, in order to cet rid of the
actual question, the former was rejected by 121 to 91, majority for the
Women 33.
The cheering was a caution. But—we would not damp anybody's
happiness; on the contrary, we would dry it as much as possible—but
notice was given by ME. BOUVERIE, next day, for rescindios the vote.
Thursday. MB. AYRTON said that he was going to give pedestrians
new advantages, by throwing into Kensington Gardens the portion of
Hyde Park lying west of the new road from Paddington to Brompton.
Having no acquaintance with either of the last-mentioned plebeian
localities, ДЛ-. Punch has not a distinct idea of what is contemplated,
but he will consult the map—or rather, he will permit anybody else
to do so who likes. Being no pedestrian, but a spangled aristocrat
who reclines in his gilded chariot, the topic is without interest for
him.
Government do not mean to appropriate the seats vacated by the
disfranchisement of Beverley and Bridgewater. We hear that Lowes-
toft has put in a claim, and by way of endearing itself to the Executive
offers, if allowed members, to call itself Boblowestoft.
During the Convent debates, MB. WBALLEY thought he heard
somebody cry, "Kick him!" "Strangle him!'" The probability is,
that some Member, who had dined, did use the words; and if so,
ought to be ashamed of himself. But Мн. WHALLEY wrote to the
Times about it, and was awfully castigated by the SPEAKER for not
bringing the matter before the House at the time, instead of writing
a letter. Nobody seems to have heard the language, however, except
the Member for Peterborough.
More Land Bill debate, redeemed only by LORD ELCHO'S telling
MB. ROBERTSON, Berwickshire, that he had reduced himself to a state
of Moral Molluskousness. MR. ROBERTSON was angry, and MR. B.
OSBORNE was much amused, and moreover, was very amusing, over this
polysyllabicalisticality.
Friday. MR. COWPER TEMPLE wants to know why MB. EDWARD
BARRY, son of SIB. CHARLES, has been dismissed from the office ol
Architect to the Houses. So does Mr. Punch, and the explanation
had better be more satisfactory than he expects.
The Red River Row is to be settled amicably. We hope that this
announcement will enable millions of Englishmen to sleep quietly in
their beds. To assist in producing this beneficial result, we would
mention that the Red River does not run out of the Red Sea, but is
somewhere in North America.
A good deal of debate as to whether the National Gallery and the
British Museum can safely be opened at night, for the benefit of those
who cannot go there in the day-time. The authorities reluctantly come
to the conclusion that this cannot be done. A fire might easily occur,
and the disaster would be irreparable.
MR. WHALLEY stated that he had ascertained that neither Catholic
nor Irish Members had desired to kick and strangle him. This is a
contribution to European history.
More Irish Land debate, rendered pleasanter by a disturbance with
SIR H. CROÎT, who had been ordered by the Chairman to be a Teller,
and who went and voted instead. So Sis H. CROÎT had to explain
that he did not know that a man could be told to be a teller agaiust his
will. In the course of the debate SIR ROUNDELL PALMER enunciated
во beautiful and rational a social rule, that Mr. Punch must close by
quoting it. "I have acted on the most intelligible of principles upon
which a man can act. I have endeavoured to get as much as I could,
and I have taken that which I was able to get." We always respected
SIR ROUNDELL PALMER'S genius—his rule is precisely that on which
Mr. Punch ever has acted.
AT THE ACADEMY-PERPLEXED.
0 the young man of the
period whose education has
been carefully neglected,
outside the classic precincts
of ancient Greece and Rome,
a visit to the Royal Academy
Exhibition, in the company
of female relatives or friends
curious for a little more in-
formation as to the subjects
of the pictures than the
Catalogue usually supplies,
must too often prove a
gloomy trial and a painful
operation, for which good
looks and dainty garments,
and an accurate moustache
and a considerable reputa-
tion for proficiency in the
waltz cannot wholly com-
pensate.
Let us enumerate a few
of the things which the
superior beinç (as man is
playfully imagined to be)
will be expected to know, on any day and at any hour Ъе1теееп eight
in the morning and seven in the evening, from now to the end of
July, without help from dictionaries, encyclopedias, gazetteers, com-
pendiums, or manuals, in his humiliating progress through the galleries
m Piccadilly.
He will be expected to be familiar with the history of CLEOPATRA,
MR. KELK, St. Perpetua, SIR CHARLES LYELL, TOBQUEMADA, REV.
DR. CANDLISH. DIANA OP POICTIEJS, GENERAL LAFAYETTE, ROBERT
THE BRUCE, MR. BURNB JONES, MARSHAL NEY, SIB ROGEB DE

TER, Christabel, BARON PIGOTT, the Earls of DESMOND and OBMOND,
Sophia Western, SIB CHARLES WHEATSTONE, ULYSSES, MB. LAIRD,
SIR WALTEB RALEIGH, Sir Galahad, ROBESPIERRE, Undine, the
EMPRESS JOSEPHINE, BEAU FIELDING, Launceloí Gobio, the KING OF
ROME, Nydia, the DUCHESS D'ANGOULEME, GIOBGIONE, GABBLELLB
D'EsiRÍES, Daphne, and the Seven Bishops—about all of whom, with
the exception of MRS. ROUSBY, whom he has had the good luck to see
and hear, the Pytchley Hunt, SIB ROGER DE COVER.LEY (in connection
with the dance of which he was the inventor), and perhaps one or two
of hi« old I<empriire friends, the young man of the period will be utterly
vague, unsatisfactory, and dumbfounded.

Furthermore, he will be expected to have at his fingers' ends the
exact geographical position of the Doggerbank, Sherwood Forest,
McGillicuddy Reeks, thePirteus, Pompeii, Leith Hill, Salamis, Swanage,
the Scheldt, the Lido, the Lizard, Calabria, Cheyne Walk, K n ole Park,
Brixham, and the Oise; and may be counted as finding himself com-
pletely out of his latitude, and proposing an adjournment to the
refreshment-room long before the banks of the Oise are reached.
Lastly, he will be tormented with questions on such subjects as
Fata Morgana, Maundy Thursday, the Decameron, the Vestal, Herne
the Hunter, ¡limosa púdica, the Sentimental Jonrney, and the
j Broach Exhibition; and will be asked What is a rebecf What is a
mangold P What is an acolyte P How is Pharmaceutical pronounced f
Where do you put the accent on Tadema P Who was Sir Charles
Grandison? When did the LORD CHANCELLOR become a Fishmonger?
Who are the Contadini?—ysA What is the derivation of chalybeate ?—
until he will wish himself away at billiards, or athletic sports, or
pigeon-shooting, or any other pursuit which requires no historical
research, and can be followed without reference to chronology or
poetry.
But let him take heart. There are plenty of pictures before which
, he may stand in comfort, with fair companions, free from all alarm as
to dates, undisturbed by the apprehension of biographical queries.
There are the portraits of the people about whom the Catalogue says
everything that need be known; there are the landscapes and seascapes
with judicious general titles; there are the little domestic pictures
telling their own story; there is fruit, there are flowers, there are
horses and dogs, babies and pets, cats and kittens, monkeys and birds,
bankers and orphans. Grand Chapl&ins, Town Clerks, and Masters
of Hounds, St. Paul s and the Monument, and—never-failing delight
—there are Lords and Ladies, and the Royal Children.
PLENTY TO FIGHT FOR.
THROUGH the French Atlantic Cable, the other day, came the fol-
lowing message from Washington :—
"It is reported that the Mormons are secretly arming for the purpose of
resisting the enforcement of the national laws against polygamy."
Chiefs and Rulers in prospect of invasion, have ever found that the
strongest incentive to vigorous and determined resistance they could
address to their people was an exhortation to fight for their wives and
children. How strenuously, then, may the Mormons be expected to
resist the United States Government when that appeal, always so
effectually made to cther communities at large, is made to every one
man of their community. BBIGHAM YOUNG, of course, will call upon
each individual male Mormon to fight for bis wives. Being, as the
Mahometans are, polygamists, the Mormons will fight like Turks.

THE PROFESSORESS'S PROPHECY.
(A propos of JacoB BRIGHT's Bill, for doing away with the Electoral Dis-
abilities of Women, read a second time, by 12% to 91, Wednesday, May 4.)
In the close ladies' pen at the back of the gallery,
A strong-minded Fair-One thus mused, as she sat,
Confounding male reason with feminine raillery,
And dealing M.P.'s far below tit-for-tat :-
“In the ‘ladies' pen' now, with brass grating-no doubt on't, -
We must sit, like caged birds, but 'twill soon come to pass,
Ladies' pen you'll have none, but thank ladies' tongues out on't,
Sweet sounds with your 'grating,' and gold with your 'brass.'
“Our fate is fore-cast, by Darwinian selection-
To the floor of the Commons to rise from the pen !
When once we are ‘Ladies' confessed 'of Election:-
Pretty 'Lords of Creation' you'll be, you poor men!
“Like a vision before me rise new generations,
Of lady-Professors, and men whom they school:
While oʻer Commons, new-cultured with petticoat-patience,
Those best Lords of Manners, the Ladies, hold rule!
“Like a well-governed household, with woman for head on't,
How unlike old England new England will feel !
Nothing we have to say on a point left unsaid on't-
And our foul linen washed, as we wash-en famille !
“With smiles, sighs, lips and eyes, of the lady-whips busy,
What male combination of parties can stand ?
Think of GLADSTONE and HUBBY, and JOHN BRIGHT and Dizzy,
Tooled along, tame, by me, in a neat four-in-hand !
“Of Lowe's head in its place. 'neath the heel of my slipper-
Of brakes fixed to each male-sex-talking-machine,
Or, for cutting its yarns short, a feminine clipper-
Mrs. Silencer,' where 'Mr. Speaker' hath been !
"No more of the public time wasted in talking,
As it now is, in manly discussion absurd;
For, besides our machinery male prate for balking,
As women we always will have the last word.
"If the waves stoop their crests to BRITANNIA's ruling,
The storms of the Commons will soon yield to ours.
And o'er any that kicks-we'll stand no 'LORD CHARLES'* fooling-
Our 'dashing white Sergeant'-at-Arms shall have powers !
“We'll have no more of wars—for our sex don't like fighting :
We'll have no more of debt--for our sex don't like tick:
We'll have no more old maids-for, their injuries righting,
We'll make batch’lors marry, at point of the stick!
« Ce n'est que le first pas qui coûte! We have won it!
Once insert the small end of the wedge-it remains !
Second reading is carried! The men think they've done it!
No-the voice may be JACOB's—but ours are the brains !"
• LORD CHARLES RUSSELL, now Sergeant-at-Arms of the House, is a mild
officer, who does his sergeanting gently.

TEMPERANCE TO EXCESS.
HEN SHAKSPEARE, by
the mouth of Hamlet,
tells the Players that
they must "acquire
and beget a tempe-
rance," he civesthem
advice which, in a
sense, it Rood for all
who Set in the play
of life, unless, indeed
they are. or are qua-
lified to become, con-
sistent members of
the National Tempe-
rante League. That
laudable Society
(which works by
moral suasion) held
its annual meeting
on Monday last week
at Bieter Hall, und er
the presidency of
MR. SAMUEÍBO*LY,
who, in addressing
his congregation,
said, not perhaps
altogether without
consideration, that:
"When he should have the happiness of hearing ladies after coming from their parties
eay. 'Those vulgar people had wine ou their table,' then he ihould expect to see » change
in the habite of the people with respect to drinking."
But, at present, ladies coming from parties, dinner-parties, for example, would
certainly say, if facts had given them occasion to, " Those vulgar people had gin
on their table." Hence, however, there appears little reason to expect any change,
with respect to drinking, in the habits of the people who drink gin. The parties, on
the other hand, at which ladites are present, and there is wine on the table, are, for
the most part, assemblages where temperance is the rule, and intemperance, in the
slightest degree, the derided exception. Can ladies, too, be expected ever to call
people vulgar simply for having wine on their table P There is one party, at least,
of which, surely, they will never impute vulgarity to the givers for that reason.
The thought of it might have occurred to MR. BOWLY in Exeter Hall. Where
is the lady who will venture to call those people vulgar who have wine upon their
table at a wedding-breakfast?

A BRITISH BLESSING FOE INDIA.
EVERYBODY who is interested in the material as well as moral pros-
perity of the Eastern portion of those dominions below whose horizon
the sun never descends, must wish success to SIR RICHARD TEMPLE'S
endeavour to make up the deficit of the Indian Revenue. This object
he proposes to effect by a slight augmentation of a popular impost.
That is to say, he is going to raise the Indian Income-Tax from the
ridiculously low figure of 1 per cent, to the moderate amount of 3¿.
The fraction in excess of the whole number bespeaks a nicety of adjust-
ment which will be appreciated by "Oriental scrupulosity.
SIR RICHABD TEMPLE expects, by thus little more than tripling the
weight of an extremely light burden, to raise an amount of money
nearly treble—nearly, not quite, because there are a few untruthful
persons even in India who would be quite capable of withholding in-
formation, especially information required for the purpose of assessing
them under any fiscal arrangement whatsoever, even one so fair and
equitable as that of Schedule 1). But most of them would much rather
be robbed than cheat their Government; and their conscientiousness is
equalled only by their artlessness. They would make that Government
the most accurate returns of their affairs they possibly could, although
fully convinced that they were thereby supplying it with knowledge
which it wanted to be enabled to plunder them.
Does not SIR RICHARD TEMPLE very much wish he may get it P Of
course he does, and with every reason. By the natives of India in
general a tax, ever so unjust, would no doubt be honestly paid, even
though the amount of their liability to it had to be calculated on data
supplied by themselves in an enforced confessional.
Of the small number of Indians who will possibly understate their
incomes to be taxed at only 3¿ per cent., the majority will assuredly be
induced by feelings of compunction to pay up the full amount which
they ought to have subjected themselves 11 be charged, to the last
anna. Occasionally the leading Journal of India will contain acknow-
ledgments by the Indian Chancellor of the Exchequer of the receipt of
certain rupees. "conscience money" on account of "Income-Tax un-
paid," from defaulting but repentant Baboos and Zemindars. Even
Ryots may not be quite out of the question.
Whatever quantity of Income-Tax the Government of India may
determine to screw out of an open and ingenuous people, there is not
the slightest likelihood that, in order to do it, they will need to employ
thumbscrews.
THE SLANG OF THE STAGE.
HERE is an odd theatrical advertisement :—
WANTED, a HEAVY MAN for the Tragic and Melodramatic
business.
We have heard of " heavy fathers," but we fancy they are chiefly to
be met with in light comedies. To ask for heaviness in any tragic
English actor appears to us like asking for blackness in a blackberry,
or sweetness in a sugar-plum. But perhaps this heavy Vían may be
wanted to give weight to the characters he personates. We can fancy
a fat Hamlet might, merely for the novelty, make somewhat of a hit.
Certainly his pinguitude, during the warm weather, would give especial
point to such a passage, say, as—
"0 that this too, too «olid flesh would melt!'
THE ABILITIES OF WOMEN.

Cleopatra says this to one whose condition is dot above that of a
messenger. A British CLEOPATRA, qualified to represent a borough,
might say as much to à British elector, or she might only eay half us
much, and, if that were the latter half, as the law now stands, she
could not be unseated for bribery. Verb. tat. insip.

THE Crystal Palace, in addition to its
thousand and one other entertainments (for
they are really now as numerous as those of
the Arabian Nighti) will offer shortly, it is
stated, a thousand and second, in the shape
of baths where we may entertain ourselves
by swimming, or by seeing others swim. In
these speculative days it is not always easy to
keep one's head above water, and practice in
that element will probably enable one to do
so to perfection. By all who are conservatives
of cleanliness and health no doubt the Crystal
baths will be most liberally patronised • and
they who have a radical abhorrence of cold
water may have as much warm as they
please, if they merely ask and pay for it.
Aquatic Derbies will be swum, ami we are
promised "exhibitions of ornamental swim-
luing," which to help the treasury will pro-
bably be useful. We expect that the Crystal
Palace Companions of the Bath will speedily
subscribe the floating capital required, and
there is little ground for doubting, now the
scheme is well afloat, that their enterprise
and they alike will go on swimmingly.

"ASKING for bread, and giving a stone," is the antipodes of true
charity; and yet there are cases, when a stone—being asked, because
bread and stone are both wanted, and the buying the bread leaves
nothing to buy a stone with—should be given, with the hope that it
will bring a blessing with it, and lift oil1 a reproach. Such a case is
that which Mr. Punch is here glad to make known to his readers.
GEORGS CATTERMOLB, living and working, late and early, could pay

LOW GAMBLERS AND THE BETTER ORDERS.
WHILST Parliament is talking the law remains, and is Ijkely to
remain how much longer Heaven only knows, in the state attested by
the following item of news :—
"BOY GAMBLERS.—JOHN FERGUSON was convicted at Willenhall, Stafford-
shire, yesterday afternoon, and fined £5 and costs, or two months' imprisonment,
for keeping a private gaming hell for apprentice boye. The house wag gome-
times crowded with locksmith«' apprentices, who paid defendant a fee upon
every game of dice and carde. Boye seven year« old were amongst the gamblere.
Wine, whiskey, and ale were drunk, and heavy mime were won and lost.
Defendant wa« stakeholder. The evidence showed that he counselled the boys,
if they had no money of their own to stake, to rob their masters of two or
three sovereigns."
All this villany has cost the criminal convicted of it only five pounds,
which he probably paid snapping his fingers. If he had not the money,
he is undergoing a short two months' seclusion. Forfeiture of goods
and chattels, with, and not or, five years' penal servitude, would have
more nearly met the demerits of his case. When will such a fellow be
rendered liable by statute to be punished as he deserves P When Par-
liament shall have done spouting, and has set to work P Not even
then, perhaps, for some time; probably not until Parliament shall have
made its mind up to put down all gambling whether in high life or low.
The Legislature, doubtless, feels that the contrast between the punish-
ment of the keeper of a gaming-house for the inferior classes as a felon,
and the absolute impunity of the proprietor of an aristocratic betting-
oilicu under another name, would be too striking.
A Rousing Question.
WHEN the Jockey Club met at Newmarket on Wednesday last week,
ADMIRAL RODS, according to the newspapers, moved the appointment
of a Committee "to take into consideration the present condition of
the Turf, excluding the subject of betting from their deliberations."
This may seem like proposing to perform the play of Hamlet with
Hamlet's special business omitted. But, on the other hand, the gallant
Admiral of the Green may very fairly ask the great Racing Tribunal
this question, "What 's the odds, so long as you 're happy P"

THE MUTUAL TESTIMONIAL GUAEANTEE
ASSOCIATION.
TERN is the truth that testi-
monials are nowadays _ as
plentiful as gooseberries.
They are given to all kinds
of people, for all sorts of
service,from sweepingdown
an enemy to sweeping down
a street. A dustman or a
duke alike is deemed to be
deserving of them. Fortune,
with equal hand, assigns
them to a marquis or a
milliner, a costermonger or
a count. Even a cab-driver
may wake to find himself
famous some fine morning,
and may get a testimonial
for having driven some one
safely through the arch of
Temple Bar, and reached
the Bank without a capsize
in Cheapside; or the captain
of a river steamboat may
receive a testimonial from
his truly grateful passengers
for piloting them safely
through the perils of the
Pool.
As testimonials are things
now in such general demand,
it is thought a fitting season
to establish a society for
their regular supply to all
who are in need of them. This important object the Guarantee Associa-1
tion, whose title heads this notice, is intended to effect; and considerable
trouble is expected to be saved by it. Men of every rank and station,
not omitting the cab-rank, nor excluding the police-station, will be
eligible to be members of this association, and will be each presented
with a fitting testimonial, in proportion to the money they think proper
to subscribe. While LORD Том NODDY gets a handsome candelabra
or epergne, in grateful recognition of imaginary service he has rendered
to the State, MR. BINKS, the bagman, may receive a pair of bellows, or
an elegant tobacco-box, in graceful recognition of supposititious ser-
vices, while he mentally took the chair of some imaginary club. SIGNOR
Soi.FA, the unrivalled tenor (in his own opinion) may receive a silver
tuning-fork, on which may be engraved the thanks of somebody or
other, whose opera he has saved by his high ut de poitrine; and MR.
STALKER, the stage-manager, may get a plated coffee-pot, in acknow-
ledgment of the many acts of quite imaginary courtesy which some-
body or other may assert he has performed.
In order properly to meet the wants of the subscribers, a great
number of things fitted to be given as testimonials will be always Kept
in readiness by the Guarantee Association; and an author of expe-
rience in writing works of fiction will be daily in attendance for com-
posing fine inscriptions, setting forth the fancied services for which
a testimonial is decreed as a reward. Special penny-a-liners will like-
wise be engaged, for inventing the reports of imaginary meetings, at
which a testimonial is supposed to be presented, and detailing all the
speeches presumed there to be made. In short, no pains will be
wanting to carry out the object of this excellent society, and supply a
testimonial to all who are in want of one, to decorate their drawing-
room or advertise their name.

80NQS OF THE SORROWFUL.
FRENCH JUSTICE TO IRELAND.
COMPARISONS are not always odious. We can take no offence at the
comparison implied in the query whicli concludes the subjoined obser-
vation made by the Journal des Débats, respecting Greece :—
"We «ее with regret that the tone of the English Prese has become much
more vindictive. An entire nation cannot and should not be condemned for
> single crime. Some of the London papera (peak of nothing le» than of
putting Greece in a state of liege, and of making a deecent there with Zouaves.
What would they say if we proposed to aeiid aome to Ireland?"
Certainly Greece and Ireland are very much like one another, espe-
cially Ireland. What should we say if our French friends proposed to
tend some Zouaves to that isle of mutiny У That they were very kind
indeed, and we thanked them heartily, but would save them the trouble.
SONG FOR THE POSTMEN,—" Ob, letters, be happy together!"
II.-THE UNLUCKY JOKER.
VEUT few go through life without making mistakes,
And, alas, I made one which has cost me a deal,
Not in money, with me that small difference makes.
For I'm wealthy; but think what a fellow must feel
Who has really a horror of punsters and puns—
Who 's a dull person holding a post in the Mint,
One who drinks potass water, likes yesterday's buns—
But who once made a joke, and it got into print.
At my lodgings—I 've lived there a good twenty years,
I am known as the quietest, glummest of men,
And my rent has been never one day in arrears,
I am always in bed at a quarter past ten.
But, alas, on one fatal occasion there came
A waggish relation possessing a squint,
To play at backgammon, and during the game
I made a bad joke, and it got into print.
My life from that evening has been one of sadness,
That joke in my teeth my companions will fling.
I cannot conjecture what midsummer madness
Could ever induce me to do such a thing.
They swear I'm a jester who 's only concealed his
Droll powers through cunning; each action they tint
With colour that's comic; they say," He's revealed his
Trae self by that joke which has got into print."
At luncheon they laugh till I 'm terribly flustered,
And snap up my chop in a hurry to go;
They roar when I ask for the salt or the mustard,
And this to a man who is solemn and slow.
The waiter, his countenance scarcely controlling,
Annoys me, and at his behaviour I hint,
And he grins as he says (which is hardly consoling)
"It 's cos of that joke, Sir, as got into print."
My landlady laughs as she 's laying my table,
A soberer person I never yet knew;
I see that to keep down her mirth she 's scarce able,
And has to go out for a minute or two.
A snigger I hear in the passage—I know it—
I happened to mention the word " peppermint;"
The idiots think it sounds funny and show it—
That joke is the reason whicli got into print.
I've letters by dozens from distant relations.
From friends and from strangers, who seek autographs;
Each knock by the postman brings on palpitations—
I 'm not at all one who is given to laughs.
I 'm steady and heavy, and stupid one might say,
In matters of business am firm as a flint.
And none of my friends heard me anything bright say,
ТШ I made that vile joke which they put into print.
Oh, if you are dull don't attempt to be funny,
But take a most terrible warning from me;
For what is good health and possession of money
To one who gives vent to a bad,;«« d'eiprit.
And who pays for it thus. I can never live through it—
Or, if L succeed, 'twill be purely by dint
Of an effort gigantic—why, why did I do it P
Never venture a joke that may get into print.
One view of the matter gives slight consolation
To one who 's a thinker, as I am, you know;
And that is what trifles may bring reputation,
And sometimes small talents may make a great show.
One daub may make Maulstick, one slang-song make Quaver,
One coarse speech make Browbeat, one pill Doctor Lint;
And though no owl 's stupider, grimmer, or graver,
One joke may make you, if it gets into print.
The New Bule of Home.
THE rule hitherto observed by (Ecumenical Councils has been that
of (final semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibut. This, should the Conncil
now iu Session declare the POPE infallible, will have to undergo a slight
alteration. For the future, as modified, it will be. Quod яипс, quod
Kama, quod ab uno.

LOEDS AND COMMONS.
THE Master of the Holla has decided against the right of Queen's
College, Oxford, as Lord of the Manor, to enclose Plumstead Common.
It was natural enough that the Commoners of that lively marsh
should exult in their triumph, and no way unnatural that they should
take a rather irrational style of commemorating the event—
"By the old .English method of roasting an ox, and by gigantic bonfires
and fireworks."
Nor can we blame those who, like their commons, have been
so audaciously taken in, for letting out a little,—by deciding on the
demolition of—
"All the existing fences and other encroachments."
But when we learn that—
"The work of demolition commenced in earnest on Friday, during which
day miles of fences were broken down, and carried home for firewood ;"
That—
"On Saturday morning the rioters demolished 2,000 feet of fencing on the
land of MR. WILLIAM TONQUE, builder, Montera Villa, Barrage Road, Plum-
stead, purchased from the Lords of the Manor, and enclosed some fire yean
ego, and in respect of which the Master of the Rolls made no order ;"
and that these bold wreckers subsequently announced their intention
of pulling down—
"Five houses erected on MR. TONGUE'S land, together with all other houses,
wall«, &c., recently erected on the common, including the garden of the
Plumetead veetry clerk, the premises of the Prince of Wales Tavern, &c.,
&c., &c.,"
we begin to see that Lords of Misrule are apt to better the in-
struction of Lords of Manors, in the way of trampling rights under
foot; and to feel that the plundering of the one cannot be pleaded in
justification of the pilfering of the other.
Mr. Punch, as an advocate of common rights, is bound to set his face
against common wrongs. He is glad to learn that out of the—
"Crowd of 500 or 600 persona, nine-tenths of whom had no pretension to
being commoners, whom the police found busy with axes, hammers, and carta,
demolishing and carrying off the wood of the wrecked fences,"
three were fined by the magistrates, and summonses granted against a
dozen more.
Plumstead Commoners claim "right of turbary," but that is no
reason why those who are not Commoners should exercise the right of
"disturbary" in this lawless fashion.
If Lords of the Manors trample the law under foot, the more reason
those who invoke the law against them should respect the power they
appeal to. ___
Not Half Enough.
"A new daily paper will, it is said, be shortly started in London, combining
the peculiar characteristics of the Saturday Review, the Athenteum, and
Punch."
WHY stop short? Why not also combine the "peculiar characte-
ristics" of Bell's Life, the Record, the Economist, the Illustrated London
News, Notes and Queries, and Le Follet?

PUZZLED TO DEATH.
A QUIET old English gentleman came across the following item of
news in his Sunday paper :—
"It is stated that the QUEEN has granted the DEAN OF WINCHESTER a dis-
pensation from all attendances at the Cathedral, on account of his advanced
age."
After deep consideration he came to the conclusion, that HEB
MAJESTY must be acting for the POPE. "He 's the only person who
grants dispensations," he said to his doctor, who happened to look in.
"I beg your pardon," replied his medical adviser, "That 's a common
error. Haven't I a Dispensary in the village P"
The poor gentleman retired to his room, and has not been seen since.
"The Master hath Spoken."
"Miss M A RTF, WILTON intends to retire from the stage," states a
contemporary. Of course she does—at the end of each performance,
and after the enthusiastic " call," in her case a custom which Mr. Punch
(usually hostile to such demonstrations) heartily approves. Why
should she remain when the play is over P But that is the only retire-
ment, on the part of MRS. BANCROFT, of which Mr. Punch will hear a
word for many a long year—to be rendered shorter by delightful
evenings contrived for him by that lady and MB. ROBERTSON.
The Educational Question.
APROPOS of the "Religious difficulty" the managers and publishers
of Bradthaic's Railway Guide are delighted at hearing that there is a
fair prospect of a "Time Table" being introduced into all schools as a
solution of the religious difficulty.
A CRYING NUISANCE.
LITERATURE is a good thing, and so is exercise of lungs; but some-
times, when combined, they are productive of a nuisance. This, the
hawking of cheap newspapers by loud-voiced little boys, has recently
become. One can hardly walk a step without being half deafened by
the bawling of these brats. No sooner have you put your foot beyond
your doorstep, than the Penny 'Olborn Times is dinned into your ear,
followed in few moments by the 'Âpenny Smi/el News, or the
Farthing Strand Gazette. Almost every parish has its local "organ," and
this, when shouted out by small boys, is pretty much as great a
nuisance as a barrel one. On a Sunday morning, too, when alter six
days' row and rattle, one sighs to be at peace, in certain "quiet
streets" the weekly newspapers are cried, and the bellowing of their
names is as much a crying nuisance as that of "Cree-eeses!" or
"Fine awringe !" later in the day.
« More than Echoes Talk Along the Walla."
THE Echo that " answered in the affirmative" has long been histo-
rical. But its fame will be rivalled by as extraordinary a response
which was given, the other day, in the Home Office. Some strong-
minded ladies came to MB, BRUCE to ask for the repeal of a very useful
police law. One of them assailed MR. BRUCE with the dreadful words,
1 bring' you a message from the men of Kent. They have not for-
gotten their countryman, WAT TÏLER!" "What Nonsense!" was
Echo's prompt but uncivil rejoinder.

CONSTABULARY DESTITUTION.
WAS an ATTES BOROUGH, whose iron
shutters were quietly and slowly bored
through the other night in Fleet Street.
В wag a BEAUMONT, into whose house
in Piccadilly burglars made their way a
few evenings ago between 9 and 9 30,
and stole jewellery to the value of £10 000.
Everybody naturally screams, "Where
were the Police F" and Echo answers,
not " where," of course, but "ice," with
the i soft. С is a castle, as every
Englishman's house is supposed to be,
but it is a castle liable, in London at
bast., at any hour of the night, if not
the day, to be surprised and broken into
by burglars. The Police are our earthly
Guardian Angels; but their number is
so small, comparatively to our own,
that they would need angel's wings to
be ordinarily at our beck and call in case of need, and, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, angel's ears also, to be able to bear us call them.
And their visits are, in retard to each householder, like those of angels.
The А В С of Police inadequacy having been stated, it is unneces-
sary, though it would be easy, to go through the whole alphabet. Our
social Army requires to be augmented. COLONEL HENDERSON would
probably find it enough to commission a Police-sergeant to hold up his
finger; at any rate a bunnh of ribbons in the sergeant's helmet would
prove a sufficient attraction, nr, besides, a number of bills might be
posted about inviting spirited young men to enlist in the corps, indi-
cated by a handsome full-length illustration representing one of its
gallant officers. No necessary increase of pay would be grudged by
judicious and truly economic*! rate-payers, and any that is needed
should be promptly allowed
It is very much to be desired that the Chief Commissioner of the
Police Force should rank wii h a Field Marshal, and be raised to the
Peerage, with a salary sufficient to maintain his dignity; moreover,
that he should receive the first vacant Qarter; but in the meantime be
could be created a C.B., wnic.h letters, supposed to stand for Cold
Bath, might strike terror into the minds of evil-doers.
Baronetcies, in reasonable plnnty, should be conferred on meritorious
inspectors and successful detectives. Medals, with any fitting number
of clasps, should be awarded to private constables who have distin-
guished themselves; and any uncommon act of daring on the part of any
member of the Force, performed in apprehending a ruffian, or other-
wise in the discharge of his duty, should be recompensed with the
Victoria Cross. The thing is as cheap as a cabman's badge, and homage
costs nothing.
By these acknowledgments of the due position of the police in the
scale of honour, that brauch of the service would be rendered popular
and attractive, and then it would never be either under-officered or
under-manned. Men of education would gladly enrol themselves
among its members, and the complaint that we lack competent
Detectives would cease. The demand for such experts would be
answered by a supply of clever men such as many of those who now go
to the Bar, and they, if not themselves the best of all possible thief-
takers, would know well how to set a thief to catch a thief.
Something ought to be don« to terminate the present insecurity of
metropolitan property, if not life too. As long as nothing is done, to
abuse the Greeks so violently as some of us do, for tolerating brigand-
age, is cool. The saucepan might j ust, as well call the tea-kettle a
nigger.

EUPHEMISM BEFORE ACCURACY.
HE contrast between our own
delicacy and the coarseness
of our forefathers is very
self-gratifying, especially
when we regard the ideas of
verbal propriety eatertained
by the sensitive playgoing
public of the present d*y.
An abridgment of Sm
JOHN VANBRUGH'S cemedy,
originally called "The Re-
lapse; or Virtue in Danger"
was produced, under the
titleof " T/ieMannf quality,"
on the evening of last Satur-
day week. On that occasion
the immense superiority in
refinement of the present
age to former periods was
strikingly illustrated. Of
course the play had under-
gone the most careful ex-
purgation; but even this

the delicacy of a modern British
critie :—
"ItwaeweUiortheetapter that he executed Ыя difficult taekwtththe
requisite vigilance, for it so happened that there was among the audience on
Saturday »venm» a handful o? nrtoou» spectator, who wire determined to
resent tbe sichtest attempt to sacrifice good manner» to wi(L The hisses with
which these precisians received Sir ТшЬМу Clmuy's energetic denunciation
of all the personages of the scene, just as the uurtain is about to fall, evoked
a counter-demonstration from tie- majority of the audienee, who, takin- up
the challenge m a defiant арий, cheered luatily."
Thus it appears that all the nicety with which unusual expression»
had been eliminated free VANBRUWI'S text was not sufficient to satisfy
a considerable minority of the Hewe. Nor certainly was it so exaet
as the purity of the age demands. Not only was an energetic denun-
ciation permuted to proceed from the month of the character named in
the foregoing extract; energetic denunciation being strong language •
but that character was suffered to retain his highly objectionable pré-
ñame, in bowety no one, even when consulting a doctor, ever uses
any expression specifically denoting the region of the digestive organs
Every person employs an euphemisim, although it confounds their
cavity with that of the respiratory. Accordingly, let us hope the
character in "The Man of quality," surnamed Clumsy, will be imme-

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MONDAT, May 9. We do not often get a bit of history in Parliament.
Some readers may like to be "reminded "—
"Men must be taught as if you taught them not,
And tilings unknown proposed as things forgot."
(didn't we quote that some years back—nunquam mem)— that in 1815.
> he Waterloo year, France, of course under Restored Royalty, bound
herself to pay £110,000 to indemnify British subjects whose property
had suffered by the Revolution, and in 181S she added another
£120,000 to the debt. The money has been all paid away lone ago,
and the MARQUIS or CLANBICARDE behaved like the BABÓN TKOP-
T \RD in asking for some of it to-night for the Irish College in Paris,
swept away in the Reign of Terror. It is possible, however, as the
Marquis hinted, that had the College been a Protestant institution,
English Ministers in other days might have looked after its interests
more vigorously. Considering that an Irishman, at Waterloo, com-
pleted NAPOLEON'S education, it might have been gracious to have
compensated the Irish College in Paris.
LORD KEDESIULE, who may never have saved the nation, en bloc,
but who is always [saying its interests in detail, urged that the new
Tramways, now beginning to traverse London, should become the
property of the local authorities after fifty years. LORD KIMBERLEY
seemed to think that this was right. By the way, we hear a good
account of these inventions, and there is some hope that they will
convert a great lot of our ramshackle and dirty omnibuses into house-
hold fuel
The Naturalisation Bill was settled, but LORD WESTBURT did not
like a person's being described as " born of a father." He wished to
stop the Bill and alter this: but LORD CLARENDON, while assenting
to the zoology, deprecated the hesitancy. The Act is wanted as the
basis of a treaty. LORD WESTBCRT, as usual, was perfectly accurate;
and if the people who draw laws would also draw from the well of
English undefiled, they would write, not " of" but "to." But he was
obliged to give in, and use the Grammar of Assent.
Mr. Punch, supposes that everybody knows that the Census is to be
taken next year, oat he just mentions the fact that ladies—no, that is
effete satire—that gentlemen who dye hair and moustaches may have
time to make up their minds as to the age they intend to be in 1871.
As for the ladies aforesaid, he trusts that they .will adopt the forin
prepared by himself Ages Ago.
"Come, fill up your Censas, and fill as you can.
What, ask us our ages, you impudent man f
Look in our faces, and write what you see;
For that 's all the help you '11 get out of We."
There is stagnation in the Prayer-Book and Church Service trade,
owing to anticipated alterations in the Lectionary. The PREMIER
stated that certain changes bad been approved by the clergy, and a
Bill was about to be introduced confirmatory of the suggestions. We
are glad of this, partly for the sake of those who are thrown out of
employment, partly because a handsome Prayer-Book is a wedding
present worthy of all acceptation, and one does not like to give a
volume that wUl soon be out of date.
Government has no intention of interfering to put down the war, or
whatever it is, in Cuba. Mr. Punch is glad. Bat his joy will in no
degree be lessened by any present he may receive of the productions of
that charming island; if he mentions Havannah, it is only because a
really well-meaning donor always likes to know what a donee most
likes. Apropos of nothing, a correspondent asks, "How can I destroy
weeds on a gravel-walk? Answer: "Smoke them as yon walk up
and down it.
Irish Land Bill in Committee, and very good progress.
At an early hour of the morning—in fact, we may as well go on to
Tuesday. (Well, it tea* Tuesday.) The POSTMASTER-GENERAL—he
does not mind early hours any more than his servants, who are
wandering about the suburbs at 3 A.M., collecting letters—remember
this at Christmas—introduced a Bill to amend the law relating to
Procedure at Elections. You might not guess from this]title that
A CABINET MDÎISTBE PROPOSES VOTE Вт BALLOT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKL
Such, however, is the fact. The Advocates of secret voting have their
triumph at last. The friend of a candidate will be able to sing—
"1 speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name!"
because he will not even have to trace it. He is to be presented with
a paper, like a cheque (bitter mockery of those who have been accus-
tomed to receive, on such occasions, real cheques) on which are printed
the names of the candidates. He is privately to strike out all the
names except that of his Man, and then is to deposit the paper in a
box. There will, as in the case of a cheque, be a counterfoil, with the
same number on it as on the voter's paper. This will enable us to
detect fraud. Quite right, but not absolute secresy, LOUD HARTING-
ION, as MB. HENRY JAMUS justly remarked.
There is more in this Bill. Nomination day, with all its riot
and ruffianism, is to be done away, and future historians must
study Pickwick if they want to do Macaulification. This is an unmixed
irood. Nomination is to be made by a paper, to be signed by Ten
Electors/ and delivered to an official, either by the candidate per-
sonally, or by his proposer or seconder. This has to be done within
two specified hours, and within those a candidate may "bolt ;" i.e.,
withdraw his notice, if he is frightened.
Public-houses are not to be used as Committee-rooms, and
Lastly, and, perhaps, bestly, Any expenditure made by a Candidate,
and not declared in the account he has to give in, shall be deemed a
Corrupt Payment.
The Bill is not to affect the Universities, which will vote as at
present, in a silent and dignified manner; in fact, through the institu-
tion under LORD HABTISGTON'S care, if Members so please. This is
the worst part of the arrangement, for the great numbers of University
votes sent from a distance are given by gentlemen whose academical
brilliance has been dulled by provincial isolation. Punch " loves to
express himself delicately, but you know what he means," as a gentle-
man says in one of FIELDING'S graceless comedies.
This evening Scotland had a small innings, and the House decided
that North Britain does not want any change in its system of Public
Prosecutions.
Then came a very odd debate indeed. "Odd," which is derived
from the Swedish mldu (bless you, Punch knows everything, and more),
describes the business better than any other word could do. Arrange
criticism in Rabelaisian fashion, and we might say that the elemente of
this discussion—it was about Opium and China—were
Bigotry
Benevolence
Self-righteousness
Evasion
Philistinism
Off-handedness
Cant
Circumbendibus
Humbug.
But, as Mr. Punch (as he has often observed) never likes to give
offence, he has no intention of assigning to each speech its share of the
above articles. Sufficeth, that SIB WILFRID LAWSON, the great
enemy of Potables, proposed that the House should condemn the
system which raises a Urge portion of the revenue of India (Six Mil-
lions) from Opium. He urged that it was a demoralising drug, and
that the Chinese authorities were opposed to its consumption by the
people. There was much talk, and there was one attempt to get away
from the topic by a Count-Out, but it could not be escaped so.
MB. GRANT DUFF, in a very clever speech, argued that we must
have the opium money, or the Indian or English public must provide
the amount, or that public works in India must be stopped. Abo,
that the traffic was not mischievous. Opium was deleterious only if
taken in excess. Also, the Chinese would have it; and if we did not
sell it to them somebody else would. Hum! Touching this latter
plea, does MB, GRANT DUFF recollect a certain poem by one WILLIAM
COWPBR (not MB. COWPER-TEMPLE), wherein the Slave Trade is
defended by one of its advocates. We might abstain from the trade, of
course—
"But then if we do, the French, Dutch, and Danes,
Will heartily thank us, no doubt, for our pains:
If we do not bay the poor Creechers, they will,
So torture« and groans will be multiplied still."
MB. GLADSTONE perceived that his able friend wanted backing up,
for all his ability, and Ajax flung his seven-fold shield over the light-
armed Tencer. We have handed the management of the Indian
revenue to the Indian Council, and the House has no right to deprive
the People of India of this £6,000,000, and throw their finances into
confusion. But, if it were done, the House must make up the deficiency,
and he must request SIB W. LAWSON to begin by taking MB. LOWE'S
surplus, on account.
The Downright Shippen" of the day is the downright HENLEY.
We have no right to ask the Indians to give up this revenue, until
our own Government has given up the income it derives from Gin, on
which "quite as many people made beasts of themselves as on opium."
Finally, brethren, this edifying and suggestive debate was got rid of
—yes, got rid of—for the House escaped, after all. The Previous
Question, which means that it is not expedient to go into the Present
uestion, was carried by 150 to 46. We were going to laugh, but
prefer to .add, demurely, that it must be satisfactory to all 'friends of
humanity to know that the opium which we supply to China is of the
finest sort, and prepared in the most artistic manner; and it must
be clear to every moralist that it is the duty of a Chinaman to avoid
taking more than is good for him.
We own that we think a more elegant way out of the difficulty was
open. A resolution should have been carried to the effect, that it
would be disrespectful to the greatest of living novelists to enter into
the opium question »t all until the Mystery of Edwin, brood so far as it
affects Mr.Jatftr, should be solved. But the House of Commons,
often described as elephantine in its power over oaks and pins, hath
somewhat of elephantine gracefulness.
Ma. GLADSTONE nominated the Committee on Monastic Institu-
tions. It is a highly respectable one, aud is not at all likely to behave
rudely to anybody. In fact, there are gentlemen on и who would
make a point of saving pleasant things to any Lady who should be
asked to (rive evidence. This will be satisfactory, we trust, to many a
Catholic
"Who look», not lovingly, «t-thet Divan."
IPe/inesday. A meritorious Bill for doing away with a Church
scandal, on which Mr. Punch's batteries have often and damagingly
opened, was read a Second Time. It is for prohibiting the sale of
Next Presentations to Livings.
It is not wonderful that а ВШ on the subject of payment to Irish
Coroners should be introduced, considering the increase those gentle-
men have had in business by reason of the means resorted to by
sundry agitators for getting at the land. But this Bill was rejected.
Dwellers in towns will be happy to hear that, though the Bill for
preserving Suburban Commons was opposed, it was not tkrown out,
but was sent—Mr. Pttnck thinks on good grounds—to a Select Com-
mittee. LORD BTRON, scoffing at a small pact, says,
"No Common be inclosed without во Ode ;"
but if for "ode" we substitute " raw," and also enact that the row be
kicked op before the Incloeure, and in prevention thereof, his Lord-
ship's verses—thus slightly, not to say prosaically, manipulated—
might "stand part of the Bill."
Thursday. LORD HA RTIN ото» says that the Telegraph System is being
extended as rapidly as possible. The difficulty seems to be the stupidity
of the telegraphist staff, but it is improving. Why are not Persons,
females, women, the Fair Sex, almost exclusively employed, in work
which they could do so adroitly P It is not only this stupidity, how-
ever, that hinders the general use of the telegraph. Mr. Punch has
heard of people in a email locality successfully objecting to having the
wire, because they do not like the post-master to know their secrets!
A meeting of sympathy with the French Republicans had been
announced. The place, of course, Hyde Park. The day, of course,
Sunday. There was not the least reason for it—the pretext that the
French Government had asked for a certain extradition, was declared
by MB. BRUCE to be false. He said that every care should be taken
to preserve order, but this was only half an answer. We are for no
violence, but the police have as much right to walk, in bodies, through
the Park, as any other persons; and if the police happened to walk, in
bodies, through and through such a meeting, we do not see that any-
body could complain—and we do see that a good many persons would
be pleased at the peripatetic performance. However, the meeting was
given up.
On the Land Bill, MB. GLADSTONE administered a terrible wigging
to MR. BRODKICK, for something he had said about certain inferior
Judges in Ireland; and he may have been incautious. But when he
described the "little local attorneys" of Ireland as the curse of the
nation, we fancy that some gentlemen who remonstrated did so rather
perfunctorily. MB. BERNAL OSBORNE'S courageous description of
these persons was much to the same effect as that of MR. BROURICK.
Readers may observe that this Essence is something lone. They
may be—doubtless are—grateful. We are aware that it is absolute
perfection" (as an enlightened correspondent judiciously remarks),
whether it be long or short. But we claim no merit for the quantity
this time. The fact is, that we have been spinning it out to postpone,
as long as we could, the appalling and saddened revelation to which we
have now come. But when a pill has to be swallowed, don't bite it-
down with it. Here goes!
On the motion of MR. BOUVBRIE, the Bill (Мв. JACOB BRIGHT'S)
for giving Votes to Women, was REJECTED! By 220 to 94 the House
refused to go into Committee. MB. GLADSTONE was in the majority.
[Here Mr. Punch, deeply agitated, withdraws for refreshment.
Returning, and throwing away a small brown fragment, of savoury
odour, he resumes.]
Friday. No. He is unequal to further effort. The shook has been
too severe. He must try a few more cigars. He believes that the
Commons talked about the ill-conditions of vagrants, and the ill-usage
of MR. EDWABD BABBT, the distinguished architect, and that on this
latter point MB. ATRTON came to moral though not numerical grief.
But the public must respect Mr. Punch's emotion, and permit him a
brief sojourn in Cloud-land. A light, there, Ho!

TO MR. GEORGE ODQER.
(From Punch's wen Correspondence)
MY DEAR MR. ODGER,
IN your speech to the "Birmingham Labour Representation
League "—whatever that League may be, for I have known Leagues
shrunk to inches on close inspection—you are reported to have said
"that the middle-class party must do something substantial, if they
would win back the confidence of the 'working-man, which they had
now entirely lost."
Now, "the confidence of the working-man" is, I doubt not, a very
"the working-man's confidence " P
The middle class, according to my notion of it, includes a good many
working-men, though I regret to find "the working-man "—your
working-man, that is—is not among them.
But, waiving these points for a moment, let me ask you who has the
confidence of "the working-man"P Have you? If you had, I
should hare expected to see you in Parliament before this. I fancy
"the working-man," in whose name you speak, is not apt to give his
confidence at all easily; and I can't wonder at it, considering how
many humbugs have been in the habit of asking for it, and how often,
when he has "given his confidence," he has had reason to repent
of it.
I have no faith in sayings you can twist right round. Suppose
I twisted yours, and propounded "that the working-man must do
something to win back the confidence of the middle classes, which he
has now entirely lost." I think I could make out quite as good a case
in support of this reading. What, if I quoted BKOADHEAD, and the
Sheffield Revelations P Or the case of MB. JOHNSON, of Manchester,
at this very time, compelled to hide the place he sleeps in, to ride
armed, to crave special protection of the police, to secure him from
assassination, and his house and its inmates from destruction?
I am afraid that "the working-man" must do something very
"substantial " indeed, to win back the confidence of the middle class,
in the face of facts like these. Nor do I see anything in the conduct of
"the working-man" in the Hyde Park riots, or Trafalgar Square
demonstrations, of last year, in which you and other of his soi-disant
leaders and organs took a prominent part, greatly calculated to win
back the confidence of the middle class. Nor are such demonstrations
as you propose, by way of showing your sympathy with the men who
are making the cause of Republicanism contemptible and odious in
France, or for the purpose of protesting against a demand of extra-
dition which has never been made, of a kind to conciliate middle-class
confidence.
"The middle-class party," you go on to say, "cannot afford to lose
the support of the great mass of the nation."
Here, again, suppose I reverse the sentence. "What becomes of
the great mass of the nation" without the support of "the middle-
class party P"
What и "the middle-class party," in fact, but "the great mass of
the nation" under another name?
It seems to me, my dear MR. ODGEB, that of all conceivable mischief-
makers at this moment there is none so mischievous as the man who
goes about with these invidious distinctions of classes, and these sepa-
rations of class-interests, for ever in his mouth. So long as yon come
forward as "the working-man candidate," I sincerely trust you will
be beaten as decidedly as you have been beaten wherever you have
yet appeared. Not a speech you have made but has proved the nar-
rowness of your political views, and the shallowness of your political
knowledge; and I need no other gauge of you than that you have
yourself supplied me with.
"The middle class " is a fact, and it includes three parts, say, of the
adult males of a population of thirty millions. That being so, it is
rather wild to speak of it as a single political entity. But "the
working man" is not even a fact,—but an unreal abstraction. The
working population of England includes some millions of men, of all
ages, characters, and habits; some thoughtful, more thoughtless; some
industrious, more idle; some thrifty, more improvident; some sober,
more intemperate; some sensible and comprehensive in their views,
of life, duties, and politics, more rash, headstrong, and short-sighted.
But if there be one characteristic which can safely be extended to
working-men as a body, it is imperfect education, and nnfitness for

any position of which trained minds and extensive knowledge are
leading requirements. Those who profess to represent "the working-
man" may, perhaps, consider that they show, at least, one claim to
do so, when they prove that they resemble him in ehaliowness, short-
sightedness, and self-satisfaction.
That yon have this claim, my dear Mm ODGBR, I readily admit. But
I hare read your speeches, and watched your career in vain for proof
that yon possess any other. I have the honour to be, my dear MR.

THE MISJUOGMENT OF JUDGES.
HI Times, a few days ago, pub-
lished a rather extraordinary
letter. It. expressed a thoughtful
sense of a legal wrong, and was
signed "A BARRISTER." Our
learned and morally sentient
friend says :—
"Three years ago liras counsel
for the plaintiff in an action for
t'.ibi- imprisonment brought by a
poor man against a rich man, a
Magistrate and a Barrister. The
plaintiff had a verdict for £100.
The defendant moved for a new
trial; rule refused. He appealed
to the Exchequer Chamber ; judg-
ment for the plaintiff'. The defen-
dant then took the case to the
House of Lords, and yesterday the
JecisioBS of the Exchequer Chamber, the Court of Exchequer, and the LORD
CHJZF BABÓN, who tried the canee, were overruled 03- the LORD CHANCBLLOK,
two ex-Chancollore, and a Scotch Judge. The coïts are enormous, and the
question arises, how would it have been had the defendant been a poor man î ''
He would have had to pay a hundred pounds unduly, or to be made
я. bankrept. So much for answer to the question of "A BARRISTE«."
Bat there is another view of the case to be take« than that which he
suggests. His client, a poor man, will be unable to pay "enormous"
costs. Somebody must. They will come out of the rich defendant's
pocket. He will be saddled with them through the erroneous ruling
which was overruled by the Law Lords. Ought he not to have some
remedy against the Judge or Judges through whose mistake he has to
bear all that expense F In humbler spheres than the judicial, people
have to pay for the damage occasioned by their professional oversight
or nescience. But that is very hard; as when a surgeon has done his
best to set a bone, for example, and it has gone wrong. Mishap or
misapprehension entails no such hardship on learned Judges. It is
agreeable to see any of our fellow-men, though a favoured few, exempt
from a severely rigorous liability. There is nothing like taking, if
possible, as it is with regard to the case put as above by " A BAR-
RISTER," a bright and cheerful view of every question.
A Thought at Willie's.
THEKE is one toast which you are sure to hear at all Public Dinners.
It is not the Queen, nor the Rest of the Royal Family, nor the Army,
Navy, and Volunteers, nor yet the Ladies, but it is the toast of—
the evening.
Why this partiality? Why is one division of the day constantly
selected for distinction in exclusion of all the rest '( Perhaps some
Steward (sixth time) will clear up the mystery.

FOR THE SUMMER SEASON.—A Ñire Man—GUNTER.
I AM a British Beadle: I 'm not a Roman .
I laugh Architecture, Painting, and Sculpture all to scorn:
For raising Artists' danders, dealing " men-of-taste " back-handers,
And giving crooked answers to cross questions I was born.
I really don't imagine, since Bumbledom its badge in
High-place« Parliamentary was favoured to display,
That, there ever was a " purty," who such detestation hearty
Had the pleasure of enjoying, as I enjoy to-day!
I 'm the hedgehog of officials, во fenced about with bristles,
None touch me that can help it: and none touch me but to rue:
There is pungency in nettles: there is pricklineae in thistles:
But hedgehog, nettle, thùtte, in my sole self I outdo.
That in my Whitehall Offise I 'm a Bear 's the merest trifle;
"Noli-me-faiiffere" written o'er the entrance to my den:
With a paw to claw at artists, a hug their strength to stifle,
A tongue to rent my rheum on men of pencil and of pen.
'I was more to have made the Commons dread my length and strength
of jawing,
To have owed pay and promotion to my power of bites and barks,
Than in my triple toughness of hide and love of clawing,
To be tyrannous to artists and terrible to clerks.
'Twas prouder still the Treasury to have made too hot to hold me,
Tc have riled LOWE past endurance, and caused STANSFBLD curse
his day;
Yet have rendered it so terrible a piece of work to scold me,
That they were fain, for quiet life, to raise my place ала pay.
But now, at last, the summit of offensiveness I 've got to,
Capp'd bearishness's climax— at which e'en / must stop,—
Till Members who have questions to ask me are fain not to,
So " nasty " are the answers with which into them I drop.
Then crown me King of Nuisances, with crown of the wild aloe,
For barrenness, and bitterness, and prickliness in one:
If you want to have Art crippled, Invention made lie fallow,
In public works, 'tis I 'm the man to get that duty done!

QUE LITERARY PROSPECTS
Вт the aid of a clairvoyant we can state with some authority, that a
goodly crop of novele and other works of fiction will shortly be forth-
coming. Some persons are in literature pretty well as readily attracted
by a title as in Society in general are plebeian millionnaires. So we
cannot be surprised that successes are succeeded by titles somewhat
similar to those which have gained success. Here are a few samples
of the batch we may expect :—
A Race from a Widow: a Tale of Real Life, by the Author of A
Race for a Wife.
Will He Wear a Wig? a Sensation Story, by the Author of The Heir
Expectant.
Strong Lungs and Hard Livers: by the Writer of Strong Handsand
Steadfast Hearts.
And Quite Enough Two: a Sequel to the Story of One Maiden Only.
Let go the Painter: a Tale of Artist Life, written by the Author of
Stern Necessity.
Wheels within Wheelt: a Novel, by the Author of So Runt the World
Away.
A Fellow in a Fvnk: being a Companion Story to that of A Brave
Lady.
Biff Hubbie: a Domestic Story by the writer of Wee Wifie.
The Knock and the Newspaper: a Tale founded on the Poem of The
Ring and the Book.
He ia an Edile!
MR. AYBTON said he was not an edile, and his proposed operations
have been noticed in the Architect. He also said he was no gardener,
and he is about to direct some ornamental gardening in Hyde Park.
When he said lie was not an edile, nor yet a gardener, he was joking.
He is both an edile and a gardener also, and he is likewise a wag.
HIGH, LOW, BROAD, OR NARROW?
А СНАКГТГ is in existence for "Poor Widows" and "Orthodox

by the Charity Commission. Not an easy task, we imagine, at least
as regards "Orthodox Divines." In these days of perplexity and
ecclesiastical suits, when there is so much difference of opinion as
to who is and who is not a sound divine, it would be useful to know
how the Commissioners settled this difficult question, and what doc-
trine test they propose to apply to those clergymen who may desire
to become recipiente of the REV. JAMES PALKEK'S Charity.

DEAMATIC OBIGIN OF SPECIES.
HEAR MR, BUCKSTONE speaking to the toast, "Prosperity to the
General Theatrical Fund," coupled with his name at the anniversary
dinner of that Charity, by the PRDÍCE OP WALES :—
"It wna remarked a little while ago, that in the twenty-four theatres now
open in London on SHAXSFEAHB'S birthday, not one of liie playa was repre-
sented at any of them, and that music-hall tunee and nigger breakdowns were
preferred to any of his immortal works; this may be attributed to the multi-
plicity of theatre« now allowed to be erected in almost every street, where the
insane passion for burleeque is in the ascendant. A short time since a mana-
gerial authority informed us that SIIAKMTIAIU: means ruin and bankruptcy."
One would think, however, that the multiplicity of theatres would
simply afford ample accommodation in the way of entertainment to
even all the fools in London, leaving SHAKSPEARE possible at one, if
only one, honte for an intelligent public. That the multiplicity of
theatres is not anyhow the sole reason why the idiotic drama has
ousted the Shakspearian, Мк. Вис к STOKE himself will perhaps discern,
on consideration of what he himself went on to say :—
"It was not always so. I remember MB. CHARLES KEMIII.K once saying to
me, 'Ыв. BUCKSTONE, when I was at Covent Garden Theatre, with my
brother JOHN and my sister SARAH, and we could not procure attractive novelty,
we always put up SCHAKSPEB—so he pronounced the name—and SCHAKSPEB
always pulled us through.'"
Yes; but who were they whom SCHAKSPER always pulled through F
They who put him up and played his principal characters; "I, and my
brother JOHN, and my sister SARAH F" Were there now at the head
of a company at any theatre in London such a constellation as JOHN
and CHARLES KEMBLE and SARAH SUIDONS, is it not likely enough
that SHAKSPEARE would still pull them through, and not mean ruin
and bankruptcy F Let us think so, and not rather suppose that the
play-going portion of the British Public are in a transition state, revert-
ing, if the Darwinian theory of development is true, degenerating
whether or no, to the level of apei.
A JOVIAL "READING" PARTY.
ARE there not desponding spirits who say that conviviality in Eng-
land is in a rapid decline—that hospitality is fast becoming one of the
lost arts in this poor, decaying State F Good news awaits them.
There is one county, certainly, on which this reproach cannot be cast,
where the good old doings of the good old days appear to be repro-
duced with a very fair approach to a successful imitation—and that
county the Royal one, Berkshire.
On Friday last, Mr. Punch read (in the agreeable Daily News) with
audible delight, and openly expressed wishes that he had been born a
Berkshire grandee, the following cheering paragraphs, which satisfied
him that conviviality, like trade, is at last reviving in this country :—
"SHERIFFS' BANQUET AT BEADING.—The Mayor's Banquet was held on
Wednesday night at the Town Hall, Reading. . . . The Banquet Usted until
four o'clock yesterday morning."
The PRINCE and PRINCESS as WALES are expected soon to visit
Reading, to lay a foundation-stone. Wherever they go, they find a
hearty welcome; but Mr. Punch is sure, after what be has read and
quoted, that in the capital of Berkshire, they will meet with a particu-
larly jolly reception.

"KING ARTHUR, and his pals," would hardly sound respectful, cer-
tainly not romantic; and yet the expression, when examined, turns out

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ONDAY, May 16M. These Bi-
valves—oysters and muscles
—sometimes spelt " mussels"
(WEBSTER), hut consider how
much wit is lost by the latter
mode—give a deal of trouble
to the wearers of pearled
coronals. There is always an
oyster and mussel Bill going
about the House of Lords.
A supplemental one, No. 2,
passed through Committee
to-day. It may have been to
enable some oyster that had
been crossed in love to marry
a deceased mussel's sister—
we don't know.
EARL RUSSELL is to the
front again, and is welcome as
ever. He wanted some edu-
cation returns, but was ex-
cessively polite, knew delays
were unavoidable, but still, as
the subject was before Go-
vernment and Parliament—
atttl 80 on- He was promised
them on the Derby Day;
so he can read them as he
drives down — they can't be
duller than the amusement of the road.
Not so placid was a complaint of LORD SHAFTESBURY'S, nor so
bland was the reply. He wanted more speed in the production of the
report on the Lectionary, stating that АВ.СНВИПОР TILLOTSON'S Com-
mission got over similar work in six weeks, in 1689. To him responded
the BISHOP oï WINCHESTER, with information that the very haste of
the Tillotsonian Commission defeated its purpose, and nothing came of
it, whereas the Taitian Commission's report had met great acceptance,
and would soon be turned into a law. According to your nature, you
may remark, elegantly, either that DA. WLLBERFORCE'S reply was
complete ana convincing, or you may say, vulgarly, " Had him there!"
lu the Commons—stay, let us be just before we are generous. Mr.
Punch recently stated that Sia HERBERT CROFT, the excellent Con-
servative Member for the county of Hereford, got one evening into a
sort of difficulty with the Chairman of Committees, and was made a
Teller against his will. It was not SIR HERBERT CROFT, whose per-
fectly courteous and good-humoured notification of the error doubles
the pleasure with which Mr. Punch makes this marginal note in his
immortal Parliamentary history.
Touching Burglaries at the West-End, of which there have been
14 during the last 6 months, and 2 convictions have followed, LORD
EUSTACE CECIL interrogated the HOME SECRETARY, and got an answer
which was not very comforting. MR. BRUCE, however, said that the
Detectives had decreased the amount of grave offences by one-tenth.
But as the reduction had been made in an amount exceeding 7,000, it
may be thought that police arrangements are still capable of improve-
ment. It is the old story—criminals stand on no ceremony whatever,
and we stand upon the utmost ceremony with the most notorious
scoundrel. We believe that if a lawyer was attacked by a robber, and
went to the length of drawing a sword-stick in his own defence, the
learned person would go through the fencing salute before lunging.
All right for lawyers—for sundry reasons—bat laymen would like
prompter work. We shall be driven to Jedburgh justice one of these
days, eh, MR, CARLYLE?
MB. PEEK urged that Parliamentary papers in foreign languages
ought to be translated. This gentleman, who, as a tea-merchant, can
probably read Chinese, of course did not speak in his own interest, but
MR. OTWAY'S reply was sufficing—haste, and that only two or three
letters had been issued in French. Still, on the whole, and exquisitely
accomplished as every M.P. is known to be, perhaps it might be as
well to furnish the House with the vernacular. We believe, however,
that it was not a Member of Parliament who at dinner desired a French
servant to draw the porter with a head on, and conveyed his wish thus,
"Dessinez le portier anee wie tele sur,"
About Cabs. MR. BRUCE promised more legislation. But, until a
law could be ready, why could not the old law have been let alone?
At this moment no Cab has a Number Inside. All very easy to say
that there is one ou the back. But who is to squash round in the mud
or rain to take it, or run after it, as the fellow drives away, jeering î
The old system of having it inside enabled you calmly to transcribe it,
and then, if need, you had extortion or insolence in a cleft stick.
Tuesday. The BISHOP OP WINCHESTER introduced a strong and
valuable Bill, affecting Churchmen, ecclesiastical and lay. He desires
to mend the law under which Benefices are sequestrated. That means,
dear Dissenting brother, that the Endowments, which are really the
property of the Parishioners, and intended to procure for them the
best spiritual guidance, may be, and are, seized for the benefit of the
Parson's creditors, a small sum only being left by which a Curate's
services may be obtained. The Bishop spoke eloquently upon the
hardship thus caused to a parish, and upon the injury occasioned to
the Church. His remedy goes to the root of the matter. If a Clergy-
man cannot get a bankruptcy certificate, his benefice shall be forfeited,
at the discretion of his Diocesan. Of course this will prevent his
getting credit, as he now can; but then the sort of Clergyman whose
habit is debt is not one for whom,—though individuals may, in many
cases, feel pity,—the nation can afford to show much. LORD WEST-
BURY saw a violation of the rights of property; but that phrase is
becoming less and less terrible every day. LORD SALISBURY, who is
certainly no revolutionist, supported the Bill, and so did the LORD
CHANCELLOR, who did not think, indeed, that it went far enough. At
all events it will go as far as to a Select Committee.
Everybody has used strong language at the Piccadilly end of Park
Lane, so everybody will be glad to know that Hamilton Place will have
been cut through before the end of February. Yet, as this is some
nine months off, MR. DENISON thought that cabs with fares might be
allowed a certain facility. Need we add that MR. AYRTON_ had no
power to do anything of the sort, and that as people had been just told
that they would have the new road next February, he was not going
to bother for a change for so short a time. Later, he told LORD
ELCHO that people always differed, "he found," upon points of Art.
"Found" suggests a somewhat recent discovery that there м such
an affair as Art, but there must be a beginning to all things.
Mother England, finding Daughter New Zealand not getting on
quite so well as could be wished, will put Mamma's name to a little
bill—say for a million—and guarantee its payment, only daughter must
lay out the money in introducing new settlers, and making roads.
"Never refuse your hand to a friend," wrote DOUGLAS JERROLD,
"except when you have a pen in it." But sometimes the wise man
•-••'•V be surety for his friend, "notwithstanding SOLOMON," as Sidonia
says.
SIR WILLIAM GALL WE Y is laudably desirous to improve the means
of communication between England and France. Government states
that there is prospect of a great improvement. Dear Mrs. Grundy,
M'm, how do you like the Bill, whose preamble has been proved before
the Committee, for puttiug you into a railway carriage, which shall
rush to the sea, there shall be shoved on board a steamer, 140 feet, or
yards, or miles (we forget which) long, and when you get to France,
shall be put on the line again, and so spin you to Paris, M'm, without
your having had to take your parasol out of the net-work, or your
bonnet-box from under the seat P Jolly, M'm, won't it be? But
you '11 be just as sick as ever, dear lady, be well assured of that. What
do you want to go to France for, then P Why can't you be content
with Wales and the Lakes? Never seen either? Of course not. I
rejoice in your sea-tortures.
Debate whether persons of a trading turn of mind ought not to be
put upon the Indian Council. Slight hint by MR. GRANT DUFF that
some folks think that England has looked sufficiently at India, from
the tradesman's point of view. However, there is no fear of change,
for no mercantile man, whose aid is worth having, would serve for
£1200 a year.
Then was the House Counted Out. The fact is that there was a State
Ball, whereat Mr. Punch'& adored Boyal Highness the PRINCESS op
WALES wore a dress of green satin with bouillons of tulle, and a tunic
of Irish lace looped with bouquets of stephanotis. Ornaments—a
stomacher and corsage of diamonds, and necklace and bracelets of
pearls and diamonds. Head-dress—a tiara of diamonds. Orders—
Victoria and Albert, Catherine of Russia, and the Danish Order.
Which facts Mr. Punch records, partly because he is always rejoiced to
write about a Princess of whom nobody can write anything that does
not mean goodness, or grace, or both: partly, as a delicate homage to
his myriad lady-readers who tell him that they never read any Par-
liament except the Essence, and find that they know as much as
men who moon over the debates for hours."
Wednesday. Was read, a Second Time, and sent to a Select Com-
mittee, MR. BUXTON'S Bill for amending the Government of London.
It is the most dangerous and revolutionary project we ever heard of.
The LORD MAYOR is to be Mayor of All London.
"What lacks thi» Brave
That a King should hare?"
The ten boroughs are to be made into ten Municipal Bodies. The
City Mayor—hear this, Guildhall, and let your echoes shudder as they
answer—is to be called the Deputy Mayor, but may be a Vice-King in
the absence of the Great Chief. With other terrible things. Govern-
ment gasped out that no doubt the present state of affairs was not
perfect—that snch a great plan ought to be Ministerial—and that we
must inquire—yes—in point of fact, inquire. Exactly so. Hence the
Committee. The proposal takes one's breath away, and yet to think of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
a King of London. We shall insist upon his being a Member of the
House of Brunswick, and a Protestant, and that he shall have no power
to create peerages in favour of his Aldermen. But MB. BUXTON has
no idea of the storm he is Brewing.
Nextly, MR. RUSSELL GURNET, the Recorder, procured Second
Reading for a most, excellent Bill for Protecting the Property and
Earnings of Married Women. There are 800,000 of these who are
obtaining wages; and the law, which, as MR. GURNEY says, makes
marriage do for a woman what a conviction for felony would do,
permits a husband to take every shilling a woman has in the world.
Large employers of labour state that numerous husbands live a life of
idleness, seize their wives' earnings on the Saturday, and spend the
money in drink and dissipation. Nor is it among the lower class only
that such things are done, as many a poor lady, who has the gift of
teaching, can testify. If the Strong-Minded would make their Ugly
Rush for measures of this sort, it is not Mr. Punch whp would help
JOHN BULL to bar the door,—in fact, he would see no ugliness in such
agitation. "Give us votes, and we'll get that,—and the rest," is the
answer of the Strong-Minded. "Rest, and be thankful," retorts
Mr. Punch. "Why, you won't show yourselves capable of any real
exertion. Mi;. RUSKIN has just told you that if women would set
themselves, in thorough earnest, against War, no war could last a
week." May be so, or not. But when did women ever try P Let "em
stop one wRi-, .'nul we'll disfranchise ourselves, and they shall do all the
governing. Dears, excuse this digression,—the word is derived from
the Latió, digressio, a stepping away from the main subject under
consideration,—a lady can perform that little feat at times, you know,
especially when she is cornered. But bless you, generally.
Thuniay. To-night the Lords had the first grand debate of the
Session; not that it is their Lordships' fault that the Commons don't
get on with Bills, and send them up. The Peers took the Bill enabling
us to marry our Wives' Sisters, and the discussion was not infructuons,
while the result had been foreseen. LORD HOUGHTON, in an eloquent
speech, to the preparation of which he had given the care the subject
demanded, advocated the Second Reading, and his address contained a
well-digested summary of the case of those who would alter the law.
The combative work was done by LORD WBSTBURY and the BISHOP OF
PETERBOROUGH, the former being politely scornful of his old enemies
the prelates, and the latter retorting with a keenness that must have
pleased LORD WESTBURY, who likes "a foeman worthy of his steel."
The BISHOP OF RIPON supported the Bill, believing that the Bible con-
tained no prohibition of such marriage, and that the law was a burden
grievous to many. The BISHOP от LINCOLN had something to say
about POPE ALEXANDER THE SIXTH, the infamous BORGIA, and made
us unhappy by suggesting a recollection of GRISI in Lucrecia. There
were several other speakers, of course; and the LORD CHANCELLOR
delivered a severe attack upon the Society which exists for the pro-
motion of this measure. It. was not made a Government question, for
two Ministers opposed the Bill—LORD HATHERLEY and the DUKE OF
ARGYLL; and one, LORD GRANVILLE, supported it. Finally, the Bill
was rejected, but only by a majority of Four—77 to 73.
A flood bit in the Commons. LORD MILTON asked MR. LOTTE a
question. MR. STANSFELD was put up to answer it. "But I asked
tue CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER," said LORD MILTON. MR.
STANSFELD went on answering; so LORD MILTON took his hat, and
walked, deliberately, out of the House.
In a discussion about MR. EDMUNDS, of the "Scandal," whom the
Government are pressing for money said to be due, MR. HORSMAN
wished to speak in favour of the former gentleman, and therefore let
him down in the following gentle terms :—
"I blame him for his imprudence, for his folly, for his stupidity, and for
his obstinacy, still if there was nothing in his conduct intentionally, de-
signedly, and wilfully dishonest, I think his incarceration it a very strong
punishment."
Friday. LORD MILTON made a very proper speech, from a consti-
tutional point of view, contending that he had a right, in common with
the rest of Parliament, to direct access to the Queen's Ministers. MR.
LOWE explained, of course, that no rudeness had been intended; but
that as Мл. STANSFELD had got up the details of a troublesome
question, he had been asked to make the reply.
Then there was another A Y HT ox-bait i n g; but, to do MR. A. justice,
he fully maintained his character as a despiser of Art, and brought
down the .¿Esthetics upon him so tremendously that MR. GLADSTONE
had again to throw forward his Ajax shield. The National Gallery
was the question, and we are to have a worthy one—when we can
get it.
SIR ROUNDELL PALHEB addressed the House on the Greek tragedy,
and it need not be said that he did so in a manner worthy of the
occasion. Nor was the PREMIER'S reply unsatisfactory. He desired
that the whole of the evidence should be obtained, and solemnly bound
himself to maintain the honour and dignity of the country.
A CHARITY FOR QIRLS OF FASHION.
F course many bene-
volent persons must
have read with
interest the re-
ported proceedings
of friends and sub-
scribers to the Or-
thopœdic Hospital
at the annual festi-
val of that institu-
tion on Thursday
evening last at WIL-
LIS'S Rooms. They
will have been de-
lighted to learn that
this useful charity
has received 1681
patients during the
past year, and nearly
60,000 since its open-
ing more than
thirty years ago.
Touching these pa-
tients a question
may have presented
itself to more than
one reader. The
Chairman, in pro-
posing "Prosperity
to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital," described it as having been " established for
the treatment of club-foot, spinal, and other deformities." Is the beneficence of
the Orthopaedic Hospital, as its name seems to imply, limited to children? If not,
there must exist a very wide conspiracy to spell that name wrong.
But if the Hospital, named in print Orthopedic, puts not only club-footed and
otherwise deformed little boys and girls to rights, but adults likewise of either sex,
it might be advantageously opened to a class of sufferers who would be able to pay
for their accommodation and treatment within its walls, or whose friends could pay
for them.
The Paris Correspondent of the Post, the other day, quoted, for the benefit of

his fair readers, a prescription which a fashionable physician
in the French capital is accustomed to recommend for the
foot-disease occasioned by the practice of wearing high-
heeled boots and shoes. This affection is something be-
tween a dislocation and a sprain. It requires the foot to
be bandaged; and the doctor referred to treats it with a
lotion composed of the tinctures of opium and arnica.
Pride, some say, feels no pain; but that hath not appeared
from the demand for anodynes and sedatives occasioned by
high heels.
In London the fashion of hobbling about in the awk-
ward and ugly boots and shoes that necessitate surgery,
is quite common enough to be ridiculous in the sight of
all men, and deplorable in that of those who care enough
about girls to be vexed at seeing them spoil any of their
personal specialities. If they are enabled to continue
wearing high heels by a perversion of the healing art,
which assuages the pain of that hideous usage, they will,
in a short time, permanently spoil their feet by converting
a neat foot into the semblance of a neat's tongue, ready
dressed and preserved, on sale in the provision shops, if,
indeed, that sort of tongue is what it is bought for, and
would not, if it could speak, and would speak truly, call
itself horse.
Having, by a retrogression in point of taste to the
days of HOGARTH'S hags, trodden their feet out of shape,
young ladies of fashion, when hoofs shall have ceased to be
fashionable, will find themselves objects who may possibly
be glad to get their deformities reduced at the Orthopaedic
Hospital.
In the meantime it may be as well to mention, that
there are more sufferers who were born club-footed, and
otherwise distorted as to their feet, than the Orthopaedic
Hospital is able to cure, but whom it would be if it had the
needful funds.
A Query with its Answer.
"A CORRESPONDENT" asks us to tell him what "His-
tology" means. We refer him for an explanation to any
unsuccessful Dramatic author. He is sure to have known
many experts in this science.

A NEW HISTORY OF INVENTIONS.
СНЛТЕ was yet in its
cradle, philosophy «till in
its perambulator, no one
had thought of envelopes
or egg-boilers, the idea of
the sewing-machine had not
occurred to the most daring
imagination, and asparagus
tongs were only known in
the marble halls of the

P-iliict s of the MEDICI, when
GALILEO GALILEI, weary of
maintaining his claim to the
priority of the invention 9Í
the Rule of Three over his
great countryman DAUTE,
withdrew from the world
about the time that COPER-
NICUS discovered Night
Lights, to a humble cottage
near Amsterdam, to revolve
in his mind through thirteen
cloudless years, undisturbed
by monks or missionaries,
unassailed by the Inquisition
and the Star Chamber, sub-
sisting mainly on prawns
and pound-cake, and contented with the cnngenial society of his
favourite kangaroo — the deep problem which had turned KEPLER
white, prematurely aged TÏCHO B RAHE, and wrinkled, untimely, the
capacious brow and benevolent form of our own NEWTON; but which
was at last to be solved by the marvellous Florentine in the stillness of
a Michaelmas night in the solitude of a tapestried chamber, far from
the voice of the nightingale, but not altogether free from the noise of
rats, in his Oriental-dressing-gown and Eastern slippers, after a philo-
sophie meal of porridge, flavoured with curaçoa, between the hours of
one and two in the morning.
Sleep came not to the great astronomer's eyes that night. All
throngn its watches he paced the apartment with eager, restless steps.
Flans, diagrams, calculations, sketches, models employed his busy
hands and brain till the stars went in ana the milkman came out, when
GALILEO, wrapt in thought and a light overcoat, glided noiselessly
from his happy home, hurried through the unpeopled streets—em-
bracing, by the way, in his joy, with a cry of "£u/nj<to! Ei/p7j*a !" an
amazed lamp-extinguisher—roused up an eminent cabinet-maker, and
imparted to him his immortal invention of the telescope—dining-table.

m their glory in the gay purlieus of Bucklerabury.
The exact inventor is not known, but it has been satisfactorily ascer-
tained that he realised a comfortable income by the exercise of his
useful ingenuity, and was also able to lay by something for a rainy day.
The Reformation of the Calendar and the composition of the eccle-
siastical chants that embalm his name in the service and ceremonial of
the Western Church, have hitherto been supposed to be the brightest
laurels around the brnw of РОГЕ GREGORY IKE THIRTIETH; but
recent researches in tin Library of the Vatican, conducted under the
joint superintendence of Da. GUMMING and Mu. NEWDEGATE, have
Drought to light the very interesting discovery that to GREGCRY the
world is abo indebted for the famous Powder which bears his vene-
rable name, and was first compounded by his private physician in the
Baths of DIOGENES towards the close of the proceedings.
The original Latin prescription, in the POPE'S well-known auto-
graph, was found serving as a book-mark in a volume of the works of
METEMPSYCHOSIS, and at the foot of it is written a recommendation-
one which must for ever endear His Holiness to the young of all times,
climes, and creeds—that, when administered to children, the powder
should always be carefully concealed in currant-jelly.
In whose reign was the indispensable umbrella originally introduced
into this damp climate P An unsettled question which has provoked
never-ending dissension between contending antiquaries, who, while
upholding their favourite theories, have showered abuse on each other
with a steady malignity to which no parallel can, be found except in
the annals of extinct races.
The learned WATERLAND leans to the Protectorate as the period
•when the dandies of CROMWELL'S time first began to parade the then
fashionable promenades of Pentonville and the Minories, under cover
of their party-coloured umbrellas; but that great Batavian scholar
WETSTEIN, who was often in England, and became a Fellow of the
Royal Society, has disposed of WATERLAND'S notion completely, and
takes his stand on a tradition which he found current among the
Waldenses, that the Venetian envoys, who came to this country to
negotiate the establishment of Italian warehouses in the closing years
of CHARLES THE SECOND, set the fashion of using au umbrella, as a

runner of the present lorgnette), and tobacco P
HOLIKSHED tells us that QUEEN ELIZABETH knighted SIR WALTER,
that memorable afternoon when he, with all the grace of a polished
courtier and ease of a chivalrous, great-hearted gentleman, removed,
wearing gloves of taffeta, the parcel-gilt cover from the first dish of
potatoes (kidneys) ever tasted ш this country, on the occasion of the
entertainment Riven by HER MAJESTY, at Black wall, to the Ambas-
sadors from WestphaUa, after the ratification of the treaty which
secured to England a monopoly of the celebrated hams of that king-
dom at the expense of a war with the Low Countries—the commence-
ment of those rasher enterprises which marked the latter portion of
BACON'S career, and the ultimate cause of his downfall, and residence
for so many years in exile at Hamburgh.

PHŒBUS APOLLO, King of Light benignant,
In glory seated 'mid the solar blaze,

THE PRIZE RING.
LITTLE AMY, commonly called the "Coral-lip Pet," and BERTIE
BRUSHES, better known as the "dashing young Painter," are matched
for £10,000 to £5,000.
The event is expected to come off on some fine morning in June.
The Pet comes from a good school, and is acknowledged to be all that
the "Fancy painted her."
The long-talked-of match between the " Peony of Pansgrove" and
Professor SMORLWITZ. better known by his sobriquet of the " Calculating
Boy," for £5,000 to ¿50 is off.
LOTTY LAURÏLS, the "Admiral's Darling," is now in town. So
also is DARCIE DUMLKY, over whom last Summer the "Darling"
achieved such a signal conquest in a private-box. DAIICIE informs us
that he would be happy to accommodate the "Darling" in a match
for £20.000 a side. If DARCIE really means business, the "Darling"
may be heard of on Thursday Evening between eleven and three, at the
"Laughing Belles," May Fair.
Том BOLA, who fell on his knees at his first meeting with BLANCHY
BULBUL, the "Bird of Paradise," and has since been troubled with a
slight heart-affection, is now ready to make a match with the Bird for
£210.000 a side. Poor Том was for some time in a strait, having lost
his balance through the giving way of a bank, but we are glad to see
that he is now coming round. May his shadow never grow less, is the
cordial wish of his friends, who pronounce Ton BOLA the noblest
champion that ever threw—as a heavy weight—his fortune into the
ring.

THE NEW TEMPLE HALL,
OPENED BY THE PBINCES8 LOUISE, SATURDAY, MAY U, 18TO.
F ROM mail to gown: from prayers to pleas : from arms to wordy war!
Strangely Time's whirligig hath spun, alongside Temple Bar:
Since " Christ's poor soldiers" the white robe with the red cross did
don—
The good knights of the Temple of the wise KING SOLOMON.
Whom 11 voir DE PATENS knew go poor, two knights one horse most
ride—
But whose poverty grew riches, and whose humbleness waxed pride,
Ere their Church in the newTemple, that by Thames' sidestandetn proud,
HEKACLIUS, the patriarch, to MARY mother vowed.
Fair rises the New Temple, where Fleet to fields gives way,
By the river fringed with aidera green, and hawthorns white with May,
For them that fare to Westminster, by the path along the Strand,
Noisy with boats upon the stream, and man and horse on land.
East upon Fleet, and west on fields, the Templars' house stands square,
With church, and hall, and chapter-house, and cloisters carveu fair.
And between it and the river the garth lies smooth and green,
Kept for manege of great horses, and tilt and tourney keen.
There, close-shorn and long-bearded, mailed knights move to and fro,
And white-coift serving brothers in their office come and go,
And sacring-bell, and service chaunt, and organ peal ascend,
That with neighing of war-horses and clash of weapons blend.
******
And then the river-mists roll up and shut the picture in,
And the chaunts die into silence, and the neighing and the din;
And when they clear, the Templars are fall'n from house and hold,
And the fire hath had their bodies, and the Kiugs have shared their gold.
Still stands the Temple as before, with knights and Serjeants fain;
Bat mail is turned to miniver, white gown to gown of grain:
And wits, law-whetted, have thrust out weapons less sharp than they,
And if the long-bow still is drawn, it is in wordy fray.
Those whose work is change of monies the courts o' the Temple cram:
For the brethren of the Law have come on the brethren of the Lamb : *
'Tie moots, for tilts; for lance and sword, 'tis quillets of the law:
For the cleaving of the quintain, the splitting of the straw.
Crusades and .eke crusaders into Limbo-Lake have gone.
And the Templars have been followed by the Brethren of St. John:
Holy wars and wars unholy: French wars: Wars of the Rose—
Whose floweret-badge of red and white in the Temple garden blows-
Have all been fought: their blood-shed hath long grown up in grain:
Whose bread hath long been made man's flesh: that flesh worms'-
meat again:
And BLUFF KING HAL hath given the Monks their choice to go or
swing,
And the Worshipful Society its house holds of the King.
And solemnly or joyously, with state or high disport,
These Templars hold, as fits the time, Themis' or Momus' court,
Their readers' feasts, and Serjeants' feasts, and Christmas revels rare,
With kings and queens ofttimes for guests, great lords and ladies fair.
Here BLUFF KING HAL with CATHERINE hath laughed with lusty cheer,
And Goon QUEEN BESS watched masque and play with her blue eye
keen and clear,
When Master CHRISTOPHER HATTON ia a cinque pace danced his way
To the Virgin-Queen's good graces, and held them many a day.
Here on All-Hallow eve, or when the mighty yule-log blazed,
Betwixt the dogs, his Hunt i' the Hall the green-clad Ranger raised,
* The cognizance of the Templars wee a Lamb bearing a Flag.

t "Sut JOHN FORTBSCUE alludes to the revela and pastimes of the Temple
in the reign of II KNUY тнв SIXTH, and several ancient writers speak of the
grand Chrietmastes, the readers' feast«, the masques, and the sumptuous
entertainments afforded to foreign ambassadors, and even to Royalty itself.
Various dramatic shows were got up upon these ocrasions, and the leading
characters who figured at them were the ' Marshall of the Knight» Tempiart,'
the Constable Marshall, the Master of the Game«, the Lieutenant of the
Tower, the Ranger of the Forest, the Lord of Misrule, the King of Cockneys,
and Jack Straw!
"The Constable liarshatt came into the Hall on banqueting-day« ' fairly
mounted on hie mule,' clothed in complete armour, with a nest of feathers of
all colours upon his helm, and a gilt poleaze in hie hand. He was attended by
halbardiera, and preceded by drums and fifes, and by lixteen trumpeters, and
devised some sport * for passing away the afternoon.
"1 he Master of the вате, and the Ranger of the forett, were apparelled in
green velvet and green eatîn, and had hunting-horns about their necks, with
which they marched round about the fire, ' blowing three blast« of vennry.'
"The most remarkable of all the entertainments was the hunt in the hall,
when the Huntsman came in with his winding horn, dragging in with him a
cat, a fox, a purse-nut, and nine or ten couple of hound«! The ciband the
fox were both tied to the end of a statt', and were turned loose into the hall;
they were hunted with the dog«, amid the blowing of hunting-horns, and
were killed under the grate! !"—ADDUON'S History of the Templan.
And so sweeps King Misrule along: but aye, as the rout comes down,
Gauil after gaud drops off his robe, gem on gem from his crown:
Till " Merry England " sounds like a misnomer and a mock:
How should tee fiad jesting leisure, whose haste outruns the clock?
• ***••
But one glimpse of the blithe old times seemed granted to our day.
When to the site of the old Hall, upon a morn of May,
The magnates of the land, y-miied with magnates of the law,—
Judges, Serjeants, and Queen's Counsel,—a-gathering we saw:
For feasting of a Royal Prince, and, ever pleased to please,
Of our Princesses fairest where all are fair, LOUISE—
They come as Kings and Queens had come to these old walls of yore,
And never Royalty, I ween, a fairer presence wore.
The times are hard and hasty; work drives play off-the ground;
Life's field's all market-garden, where flowers are hardly found;
The ring of Temple revels sounds faint and far away;
The aureole round the Law's grey head grows dimmer day by day:
But one note of the old music from the old Hall, now laid low,
Through the bright beans and fresh panels of the new I lull seemed to fl i w;
One echo of the mirth wherewith the old Hall roof-tree rung,
Through the unmirthful silence of our time, methought, was flung,
That note was in LOUISE'S voice, so musically clear,
That echo sounded in her laugh sa sweet and so sincere.
If a blessing to Law's haunts and homes can any way be brought,
From such pure lips, such gentle heart, 'twas well it should be sought.
SNOBS AT THE OPERA.
ELL-BELOVED AND
SYMPATHISING
MR. PUNCH,
I HAPPEN to be
gifted with a musi-
cal ear (only one,
von notice: fulks
have seldom two,
I fancy), and as
my wife is vain
enough to think
she has another,
we often pay a
visit and a guinea
to the opera. Not
being swells, we
don't mind owning
that we go to hear
the music, and not
merely to show our-
selves, and chatter,
and be stared at.
Whatever inter-
rupts our hearing
we consider a great
nuisance, and one
that robs us of a
pleasure which we
pay for pretty
dearly and in just-
ice should enjoy.
Now, the small talk of the swells is most undoubtedly annoying, but
in a measure one expects to hear it at the Opera, which has ever been
regarded as a fashionable lounge. Other nuisances, however, I notice
are increasing, and 1 think they should be checked. The swells are
bad enough offenders in their way, but in some respects the snobs are
certainly far worse. Let me describe one or two who have most
recently annoyed me.
To begin with, there 's the snob who makes believe to be a critic,
and who worries me, by whispering to the friend who sits beside him
about imaginary blemishes which he pretends he can detect. While
yon are drinking in your PATTI or your NILSSON with all your eyes
and ears, yon may overhear him muttering, "That flute 's a half-tone
flat!" or "Trashy stuff, this music: won t do after GLÜCK!"
Then loo there 's the snob who pretends he 's an habitue, and tries to
act the character by lolling in his stall, and listening in a languid way,
as though he knew each note of the opera by heart. This snob annoys
his neighbours by giving himself more airs than they will hear from
the performers, and by his fidgeting in his stall and staring round the
house in the middle of a song, or going out for ices in the middle of
an Act.

Again, there is the snob who makes pretence to be a musical enthu-
siast, and plagues you by bis beating time quite audibly and visibly,
often keeping up a noisy pedal accompaniment by stamping with his
feet. This sort of snob is also a great waggler of his head to the rhythm
of the music, and fidgets you by motions like those of the old-fashioned
blue pot-bellied china figures, which inquiring little boys were sure to
set a-shaking, and finally to smash.
Besides, there is the snob whose only music in his soul is that of
vulgar music-halls and lamp-blacked nigger minstrelsy. Between the
acts he hums the "toons," as he most probably would call them,
which are now most popular with snobs of his persuasion, anrl, if he be
not sharply checked, will murmur "Walking in the Zoo" in the
garden scene of Faust.
In addition to these nuisances, the snob somniferous annoys me by
snoring in the middle of La ci darem, for instance, and by distracting
my attention to his nodding in his stall in a way that seems to threaten
his tumbling headlong out of it. This stalled-ox. is in general a beefy
sort of person, but truth would not be wanting if I called him a stalled
ass.
Then I must denounce the enthusiastic snob who commits the vulgar
outrage of applauding prematurely any singer he admires, and thus
robbing sober hearers of the last chords of accompaniment which the
composer wrote to put a proper finish to the song. Snobs such as he
annoy me by shouting " Bis!" or "Bravo!" at the instant when a
singer has uttered his last note, without waiting till the music of the
orchestra has ceased.
Finally, 1 come to the applausive snob who always applauds at the
wrong time, and calls out "By Jove, that 's fine!" at what is either
not especially commendable, or indeed is something worthy rather to
be hissed. This sort of snob is a great swindler in encores, which he
seizes every opportunity to force. At such times he will nudge his
neighbour with his elbow, and incite him to vociferate, and thus tire
the ears of all who wish to keep their hearing fresh. The applausive
snob is also pretty certain to be loud in his applause of a loud note,
and thus encourage mere shouting in lieu of real sons.
There are many other opera-and-concert-haunting snobs, who are
nightly a great nuisance to persons like myself, whose nerves quiver to
good music, and when beneath its influence cannot bear much irrita-
tion. Pray, Sir, help to pass an Act for the removal of such nuisances,
and prevent the Would-be Critics, aud the bollera, and the Time-
thumpers, and the Hummers and the Head-wagglers and the Stampers
and the Shouters and the Snorers and Encorers, from disturbing the
serenity of quiet listeners like Yours

never mislay a letter. That is just it. The comfort of mislaying letters

That comfort has been withdrawn from Mr. Punch. It is impossible
not to avail yourself of the invention, which blandly invites you to
deposit your Correspondent's letter under its initial, and then there the
letter is—and where is your excuse for not replying P Mr. Punch feels
that he shall have to give his box away to some fool ishly pedantic person
who, instead of resenting a letter of any kind, thinks that a civil address
merits a civil reply.
But it occurs to Mr. Punch that the invention might be improved.

Mr. Punch filled hie pipe. If the said writer had gumption, a glance

"Sub-Lieutenant HENBT H. DYKE, to the Sphinx, ta supernumerary."
The Sphinx, then, is a floating Theatre Royal, managed by the
Admiralty, if not under the management of the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.
Its boards, or planks, we may suppose, will be largely, though not ex-
clusively, devoted to the nautical drama. It is gratifying to note the
considerate provision which a truly Liberal Government has thus
instituted for the amusement of our gallant sailors.
(Ecumenical Strong Language.
THE Saturday Review reasserts the fact, lately reported from Rome,
that when a prelate, in debate, suggested that Protestants ought not
to be classed with infidels, and that they might even possess some
good qualities, a multitude of the Fathers assembled in St.. Peter's
arose and shouted "Httreticus, hareticus, omnes datanamus eum."
Hearing this, which must have sounded to them like very strong lan-
guage, the English Bishops present, as many of them as did not join
m it, might as well have had the nationality to exclaim, in its mild
reprehension: "Juramenlum, juramentan, quinqué solí/lis multabimini"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

BORN NOVEMBER SO, 18O9.
DIED MAY 23, 187O.
Нв who wrote the first article in this Journal, who from its establishment has been its conductor, and whose provident
suggestions take effect in the тегу pages now before the reader, has ceased from this and all other earthly care and labour.
"I, pete ecoleetes, ubi nulla est cura, recesiue,
Et tibi lit, nullo mista labore, quiea."
There is need that thi» record of his gain, but of grievous loss to those in whose name this is said, should be prepared
too early to permit itg being aught but я most imperfeot and inadequate expression of our love and of our sorrow. The
last rite has been this day paid, in the quiet burial-place by the village church, dear to him in his later years, where he was
gladdened by the voices of his children, joining in the melodies of the religion never forgotten by him when — and it was
often—he had friend to aid, or when, and it was rarely—he had enemy to pardon.
Neither to the mental not the loving nature of the man whom we are mourning, and ahall, while we survive him,
mourn, do we attempt to do justice here. We do but inscribe a memorial without which we should reluctantly permit
our Journal of this date to issue.
But it is of no stranger that we are speaking to friends known and unknown. For nearly thirty years he has guided
this periodical; and few who read it know not something of him, and of the firm, but gentle influence which he exercised
aa our director. But if this Journal has had the good fortúnete be credited with habitual advocacy of truth and justice, if
it has been praised for abstinence from the less worthy kind of satire, if it has been trusted by those who keep guard over
the purity of womanhood and of youth, we, the best witnesses, turn for a moment from our sorrow to bear the fullest and the
most willing testimony that the high and noble spirit of MABK LKUOH ever prompted generous championship, ever made
unworthy onslaught or irreverent jest impossible to the pens of those who were honoured in being coadjutors with him.
Of the deep affectionateness of his character, of the kindliness of his counsels, of the brotherly regard in which he held us,
of the gracious tact with which he encountered and smoothed away the difficulties incident to work like ours, of his genial
nature and of his modesty and self-abnegation, this is indeed a time to think, but not a time to write.
Nearly enough, indeed, of words of him over whose mortal remains the turf is newly laid. We feel that the best homage
which we can pay to him who is gone before, the one tribute which, had he foreseen this early summons to his rest, he would
have desired or permitted, is to declare our united resolve that, to the best of our ability, our future work for this Journal
shall be done in the spirit long and lovingly taught us by.the loved and revered friend who has passed to the reward of a
noble life.
May Ylth, 1870.
HE had been absent: but was with us «till
In letters, messages of wonted cheer:
We drank a quick recovery from his ill;
Asked, and were answered, "He will soon be here."
His kindly eyes looked on us from the wall:
In spirit at our board he seemed to sit,
Back into bounds too reckless mirth to call,
To quicken seemly fun and decent wit.
Little we thought the time was near at hand,
When we no more should meet those honest eyes:
Return no more that welcome blithe and bland,
Take counsel of that spirit, kind and wise!
Death has been frequent in our fellowship:
Where is A'BECKETT'S Rabelaisian style;
Where JERROLD'S wrath 'gainst wrong, and lightning quip;
Where THACKERAY'S half-sad, half sunny, smile;
Where LEECH'S facile hand and faithful brain,
The truest, tersest, abstract of the time P
All memories! And he that linked the chain,
Now theme of my obituary rhyme!
Never did brethren of the pen owe more
To elder brother, than we owed to him:
Still his wit's weapon like a Knight he bore-
Would never poison poiut, nor polish dim:
And 'twas his pride to teach us so to bear
Our blades as he bore his—keep the edge keen,
But strike above the belt: and ever wear
The armour of a conscience clear and clean.*
The while he sat among us there was none
But felt the kindlier for his kindliness:
Jealousy seemed his genial smile to shun;
Failure was soothed; more modest grew success.
Never self-seeking, keen for others' rise
And gain, before his own, he loved to see
Young wrestlers of his training win the prize,
Nor asked what his part of the prize should be.
His memory will not die out of ours
For many a year to come: the thought of him,
Erewbile associate with our merriest hours,
Will be a sad one, till all thought grows dim.
But what our loss to theirs, who with sick hearts
Sit in the darkened house, whence he has past:
Till new life shall unite whom death disparts,
Where tears are dried, and grief turns joy at last!

SKETCH OF A BENCH ON тнк BOULEVARD», OCCUPIED BY FOCB ENGLISH FEOFLE WHO ONLY KNOW EACH OTHBK BY SIQHT.
FINE TIMES FOE MADAME TUSSAUD.
AN instructive and elevating Exhibition of Plastic Art, which has
lately received some signal additions, and is now in the way to receive
more of the same kind, is MADAME TUSSAUD'S Chamber of Horrors.
The visitor to this place of historical entertainment will have the
feelings which may have taken him there gratified not only by a model
of the guillotine on a scaffold, but also by a series of coloured illustra-
tions on the surrounding walls representing numerous varieties of
corporal and capital punishment. The latter, he will observe, are pro-
cesses more complicated and less expeditious than simple decapitation,
and than the method in which MB. CALCKAM finishes the law; and
he may be tempted to question whether, if ruffianism continues to
proceed at its present rate, some one of those other methods had not
better be substituted for that. By the way, he will miss CALCBAFT
and a model of the structure whose platform constitutes his sphere of
usefulness.
He who has conducted young ladies thither at their innocent request,
or in the idea of pleasing them, will probably, in the midst of an ex-
planation of the guillotine, find himself suddenly left alone in the
middle of his discourse; his companions having vanished down-stairs.
If the effect thus wrought on gentle minds were that usually and
generally produced on the lower orders by such, spectacles as the
Horrors on view at MAпл MB TDSSAUD'S establishment, it would become
a question whether a collection of so humanising a character should
continue limited to the extent of a private show. Philanthropists and
Statesmen would do well to consider whether the elevation of the
masses would not be promoted, and that of criminals (in another sense)
prevented by the formation of a National Gallery of Crime and Punish-
ment. But as it has been found that familiarity with hanging doth
breed contempt for the gallows, Ma. CALCBAFT has been ordained to
finish the law now intra mum; and it is probable that an effect the
reverse of humanising would result from the provision of a gratuitous
Chamber of Horrors for the Million.
If most likely this would be so, is it possible that recent, if we may
not safely venture to say current, atrocities equalling or exceeding the
exploits of TROPMANN, are in any measure referable, in the way of
causation, to the prints of murders and outrages which low news-
vendors enjoy the British liberty to expose in their shop-windows P
Pictura idioiarum ntnt libri; and, if the idiots are sanguinary, what
lessons are they likely to learn out of the books such as those above
adverted to, which they can read as they run?
TO OUR CALCULATING BOYS.
Тикнк may be persons who may like to spend a happy day in
proving the correctness of this little calculation :—
"Arrested motion takei the form of light and heat. * * * If the planet
Mercury were to strike the Sun, the heat thereby generated would cover the
solar emission for nearly seven yean, while the shock of Jupiter would cover
the IOM of 32,240 years."
We have not at present leisure to amuse ourselves by working oat
this pretty little problem. But for those who like it we may propound
another similar, on the effect of sudden impact in producing light and
heat. For instance, if the heads of a dense body, for example say a
Vestry or a Poor-Law Board of Guardians, were to be knocked together
smartly (as some of them deserve to be), what amount of enlighten-
ment, if any, would arise, and what increase would be caused in the
heat of their debaters f
Bear-Baiting and its Cure.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MONDAT, May 23. In the Lords, debate, eloquently begun by LORD
CARNARVON, on the Greek atrocity. He charged agents of the Greek
Government with having been concerned in it, and could not say that
the Greek Govern-
ment itself was free
from suspicion. The
melancholy subject
was also taken up by
other noblemen, and
the answer of the
Administration was
delivered by LORD
CLARENDON, who en-
gaged that whatever
course might be
adopted should be a
worthy one, but de-
clined, pending in-
vestigation, to give a
more definite reply.
He concluded by say-
ing that it might
not be presumptuous
to express a hope
that from the Deed
of Blood we might
date the commence-
ment of a day of
real regeneration for
Greece.
In the Commons,
MR. GOSCHEN said
that there would not
be a chance of pass-
ing a Bill, this year,
for the suppression of
Vagrancy. No; a Bill
may be impossible,
but people have the
matter a good deal
i?i their own hands.
If no person ever re-
lieved a vagrant with
money, and we merely
handed him a ticket
entitling him to bread
enough for a meal,
vagrancy would be re-
markably checked, as
ha» been shown where
this mild ordeal has
been adopted. But
so long as foolish
folks will pay money
to mendicants, so
long will the breed of
mendicants be kept
up. Silly people have
been told this a thou-
sand times, but to no
end. They pretend
to be very charitable,
when they are only
gratifying a foolish
and mischievous im-
pulse.
There was talk
about the Whitsun-
tide holidays, for the
Commons are as eager
as schoolboys for
these days, and Punch
believes that many
of them keep

"REALLY, THOUGH, JOKING APART, WHAT A VERY EFFECTIVE EQUESTRIENNE COSTUME
COULD BE CONTRIVED WITH A LITTLE INGENUITY I"
Nextly, the Bill for the Abolition of University Tests was discussed,
supported by the SOLICITOR-GENERAL, who owned that MR. FAWCETT
had been right in urging that the measure should be compulsory:
opposed by MR. WALPOLE, who objected to divorce the religion of the
nation from its intellect- and, after a debate of considerable interest
to those who understand such questions, and who will probably not attend m consider-
able force upon Ep-
som Downs, was
carried on Second
Reading by 191 to GG.
Then, after two
more divisions, the
Irish Land Bill was
got quite through
Committee, and, amid
loud cheers, was or-
dered to be Reported.
MR. NEWDEGATE
wanted the LORD AD-
VOCATE of Scotland
put on the Convent
Committee. But his
Lordship declined to
serve. MR. NEWDE-
GATE would have
him, and appealed to
the House. The
House affirmed, by a
large majority, that
the LORD ADVOCATE
ought to do as he
liked.
Tuetday. Nothing
particular in the
Lords except a sug-
gestion that certain
ladies who had peti-
tioned against a cer-
tain police measure
had perpetrated the
offence of signing for
others besides them-
selves—that is, for all
their children and
servants. Such things
have been, but no
proof was given. But
the very unscrupulous
mode in which this
measure has been at-
tacked —(Punck had
better say at once
that it is for repres-
sing a great social
evil)—makes it pro-
bable that there would
be small hesitation in
affixing, under a sen-
timental sort of im-
pulse, the signatures
of anybody whose
name happened to
occur.
Wales had an in-
nings in the Com-
mons. MR WATKIN
WILLIAMS showed at
great length why the
Church of England
should be abolished
from off the face of
the Principality. But
he met an over-
mastering foe. MR,
GLADSTONE knows
all about Wales and
a
notched stick, and cut away a notch per day, until they get to their ! her Church, ancient and modern, and he demolished M it. WILLIAMS,
pastimes. MR. GLADSTONE said that the Government had no more j and evidently exulted in this feat, which was a sort of homage to the
aversion to holidays than other people, and made an allusion to "that Church. After such a combat we need hardly give the numbers, but
mysterious Wednesday," meaning the Derby Day. We are to have it may ba interesting to know that MR. WILLIAMS was supported by
'"" 45, and the PREMIER by 209.
Then occurred the most curious incident of the Session. There was
to be a debate on a Bill for repealing the police Act i lie nature whereof
is indicated in the above parenthesis. M u. CUAUÏUUD, Member for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Ayr,
Member does this, 'and persists in announcing what he sees, the
SPEAKER is compelled to turn all strangers out. This process has not
been performed for a long time. Years ago a fanatical Member cleared
the gallery while he read a chapter of the Bible to the Houae, and later
MR. JOHN O'CoNNELL did it because he thought the reporters were
unfair to him. It is hinted that Ma. CRAUÏURD did it to-day, because
he knew that the Ladies' Gallery was crammed with those who were
enemies to the Act, and he desired to show displeasure at the perti-
nacious and not тегу modest way in which the agitation has been con-
ducted. Anyhow, the galleries were all cleared, the ladies, it is said,
exclaiming, " What a shame!" and the House debated without the
reporters, who had pleasant leisure, only not having been informed of
what was to be done, and not knowing now long their exclusion might
last, they could not make so agreeable a use of the four hours during
which they were shut out as they otherwise might have done. Of
course a Member of Parliament reported the debate, and sent his
report to the Times, which published it next morning. There are no
closed doors for the English Press, save such as it closes for itself in
the interest of morals.
Still, as the exclusion of reporters was in some sort a rudeness to
the Press, Mr. Punch, the great champion of his order, will mark his
displeasure at what occurred by declining to prolong his Essence this
week. He has the greater pleasure in inflicting this blow upon the
House of Commons, inasmuch as he desires to see himself in print
earlier than usual this week, with a view to the convenience of his
myriads of friends who meet on Epsom Downs. Here is a great moral
lesson for the House of Commons and all other persons.
And now, as regards Macgregor, it is certain that

A DRAG DRAWN MILD.

drove to the Derby, a party of ten—
My friends were nine sensible, steady, joung men';
Attentive devotion to duty who find
At times to demand relaxation of mind.
A four-in-hand coach we engaged for the day,i
And driver apparelled in decent array j
Provisions in hampers, with bottles of stout,
And ale, and wine, inside were packed—we rode^out.
A trusty attendant we, too, did provide,
To mind, and administer, those things inside;
Л corkscrew brought with him had each of the'lot;'
We, everyone, fearing it might be forgot.
The sunshine was golden, bright green were'the leaves,
And corn in blade; yellow 'twill soon be in sheaves;
Then men and dogs over the stubble will stray,
And partridges fail—so time passes away!
Another reflection occurred to one's mind—
The man whose heart glows with the love of his kind,
Should drive to the Derby—for then he will see,
How happy the many below him can be.
The boys, as we passed them, all cheered with delight;
And pleasure we saw we afforded the sight
Of charming young ladies, who mustered in force,
Adorning the windows and walls on our course.
When fellows, by just turning out in good style,
Cause girls and small children to shout and to smile,
In being well mounted and properly drest,
They feel that, in short, they are blessing and blest.
Arrived on the Downs we secured a good place,
Surveyed the vast concourse, and witnessed the Race;
And having aloft a clear view of the scene,
Looked down on the people's excitement, serene.
A small sweep we had, as a thing to be done,
But half-a-crown each, the stakes MILDMAY, who won,
To a Hospital which, if 1 recollect right,
Was that of St. George, handed o'er as a mite.
So then to refreshment ourselves we applied,
With appetite, all of us, after our ride;
From veal, ham, and chicken we did not abstain,
And drank a few glasses of foreign champagne.
Descending thereafter we took a short stroll,
Amid the mixed multitude, variously droll;
They seemed very happy; but many, I think,
A little the worse were, if not much, for drink.
Betimes we retraced to our carriage the way,
For fear, if we started too late in the day,
Of personal banter and practical joke,
And neighbours exhaling unsavoury smoke.
Our road back was, hence, by comparison, clear
'Of persons excited by spirits and beer;
We got up to town all from accident free,
And after our journey were glad of our tea.
A PARRY FOR MISS BECKER'S THRUST.
MR. LOVE JONES PARBY, who promised to vote for the Woman's
Disabilities Bill, has cruelly turned his coat, and voted against it.
Miss BECKER, having charged him with the breach of promise, he has
made matters worse by giving as his reason, that, "though in Caernar-
vonshire the women are all Liberal in politics and Nonconformists in
religion, in England, and particularly in boroughs, such as Bath, the
women are Conservative, under great clerical influence, which always
tends to fetter freedom of thought."
"Love JONES PARHY!" says an advanced woman's right female of
Mr. Punch's acquaintance—" I hate him!"
Clerical Emancipation.
THE Clerical Disabilities Bill, introduced by Ma. HIBBERT, proposes
to repeal the law which forbids a clergyman to be any other man. It
provides, further, that he shall not only be free to leave the clerical
profession, but also to return to it, after having undergone certain
formalities. -: But here it stops. It does not enable him to secularise
himself twice. Should it pass, therefore, a change will perhaps be
made in the adage which at present expresses the Indelibility of Orders.
The amended saying will accordingly be, "Twice a parson, always a
parson."
"МйЛяргпртяпя..
THE Ritual Commission, and the late atrocities in Greece mentioned
in connection with the Philhellenes, have got jumbled up together in
the mind of MRS. MALAPROP. She says she cannot but approve of
righteous reform and the revision of the Dictionary, but considers that
the Philistines ought to be smitten, and thinks the less said the better
about the Athenian creed.
A RACY SUGGESTION.
WB recommend our sporting readers to the pages of Debrett, for the
latest information on the Derby Race.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.

PUNCH'S DERBY PROPHECY.
T noble Father (if you
have the happiness of
bearing that name,
and if you have not I
don't care), I do per-
ceive here a divided
duty. Half to you,
half,—and the bettor
half,—to myself. You
want a Prophecy P
Well, your reasons,
—come, pronounce,
"Oh, you have had
one every year for
such a time '(" Call
that a reason? Seems
to me it pulls the
other way. When the
Frenchman showed
the Revolutionary
Tribunal that a cer-
tain estate had been
in his family for four
hundred years, the
Judges told him that,
by his own admission,
the family had held
it quite long enough,
so they took it away.
Do you see the application? Why then rejoice, therefore, as ВНАКВГЕАИЕ says. Now
comes a beseeching look. "But, Mr. Punch, your Prophecy is so delightful!" Ah,
that's another pair of knickerbockers. I am not marble,—wish I were, this hot weather.
This brings me to my duty to myself. Ought I to write with the glass at 80°? To be
sure, I daresay it will not be that when you read what I write. Perhaps it will be
raining, snowing, or east-windy. What a lark !" Then you will need the Prophecy to
comfort you." Ah, there you go! I'm too soft-hearted, and that's a fact.
What's to happen on the Derby Day, "that Mysterious Wednesday," as my friend
MR. GLADSTONE, Member for Greenwich, calls it. You may have heard of him? Not
to know him, argues yourself uncommon obscure. But obscurity is not a crime, except
in argument. Don't be downcast. Mu. GLADSTONE called the Derby Day by that
name, and that's enough. "What's to happen P" Well, several things. Том BLOBUS
will go out in the morning, shrugging his shoulders in the most superior manner
when his wife hints Epsom, and making л face as if that pretty woman olfered him
a glass of Epsom salts. "I go to the Derby?" or,—for his grammar is not Ыз forte,
—he'll perhaps begin, " Me go?" Пе will go, though; and when he comes home
late, with his hat stuck full of penny dolls, and his eyes winking like those of a mortified
owl, he '11 say, with more or less distinctness, that he " hadn't the slightest idea of going,
but as Bon 1 OPPER—" You don't seem amused? You've had this sort of anecdote
before. Who said you hadn't? Will you tell me to my face that you expect anything
new about the Derby? Isn't this the kind of thing served up every year? "But not
by Mr. Punch." There you come with your compliments again. Well, "go on
flattering, Sir," as is said in the Angel in the Home. "A woman 's like the Koh-i-Noor,
Worth just the price you put on her." What has that to do with it? Who said
it had anything? But that's tho finish of the quotation. I despise anybody who
leaves things unfinished.
What do you say? Clear that you will not get a prophecy. Do not bo cheeky—
"the pig was killed because he had too much cheek," quo' INSPECTOR BUCKET.
I may be allowed to proceed in my own way, I hope. Did you read the debate on
Horse llacing initiated (I dare say you'd soy eliminated, you idiot) by MR. THOMAS
HUOUES? He made a very good speech. He always makes good speeches. He also
writes good books. Is there a better book than Tom Brown? If so, I shall be obliged
to you to nominate it. Looking sulky, are you, because I don't immediately come to
¡lacgreyor and the rest? I never write for sulky people. At school we sang, JIMMEY'S
in the sulks, Send him to the hulks. "Well, but seriously " Serious before the Derby?
You are an Antinomianism, Auacreontism, what is it ?—help us, PISISTRATUS CAXTON
—yes, an Anachronism. After the Derby is tho time to look serious; that is, if you
mean to pay your losses. "LAURA, LAUKA, FREDERICK'S come,"—I needn't parody,
but I mean "Wait till you 're diddled, my dear."
"You won't be diddled if I tell you what horse will win?" Don't know that. Some
fellows can't help losing, especially if they think they know how to make a book. Isn't
it in СотпдгЬу the friend looks over his friend's book, and says that whatever event in
the world happens he must lose £500. Have you read Coningsby? You are not sure.
Then you must be a muff, and a prophecy will not be of the least use to you, any more
than Sunday to the man who looted nine ways for it when he sat up after being knocked
down. "Try you?" I hate throwing away labour. I hate labour also. An open foe
may prove a kuss, But a pretended friend is wus. You don't see tho connection? I
said you were a muff; I now begin to suspect you of being a duffer.
But "the horses, the horses!" You are a beggar that wants to be set on horseback,
and nothing will do for you, you beggar, but the winner of the Derby. "Ask for a gold
coat," says you, " and you may get a gold button." , Don't come bothering me with your
proverbs. A man whose life is guideu by proverbs will certainly come to the bad. Did
you ever read Sancho, or the Proverbialwt, by the late RET. J. W. CUNNINGHAM, of
Harrow? It is a book of the last generation, and exceeding clever. Sancho was sent
to school, with proverbs for his rules, and he "took care of
Number One" so particularly, that he was expelled in a week,
for being greedy, cruel, and dishonest. Not that all proverbs
are absurd or misleading. I will recite to you a few which
appear to me to be epigrams of merit. 1 ou are yawning?
Got up too early this Derby Day, I'm afraid? Diluculo mrgere
êaluierrimum est, but if you yawn it shows that such surgery
doesn't agree with you. Take a cigar.
Aggravating, am I? Very likely; but don't you call hard
names, because they butter no parsnips; and if they did, I
wouldn't eat the latter, for I hate them. You must tato butter
with truffles, Mu. DISRAELI mention« that in Lothair. Haven't
read that? And have 1 demeaned myself to talk on a Derby
Day with a fellow that hasn't read Lothair t I am ashamed
of myself. Get the book, and read it directly. I do not suppose
that you will understand it, you being, as I havo previously
remarked, a duffer; but still, don't walk about as if you
belonged to the human race, and yet own that you have not
read Lothair. You should blush to walk among the race of
men, as Achilles says, stating his own feelings until he shall
have killed Hector. Did you ever read HOMER? What?
"Yes?" I say, my good fellow, there is a limit to everything.
Even on the Derby Day you should not. It 's the biggest that
will be told all day, and that 's saying something of a day
devoted to a harmless national amusement, and the improve-
ment of the breed of English horses. You read HOMER! He
wrote the jfâncid, did he not? A charming poem, isn't it,
all about the deliverance of Jerusalem? Beautifully illustrated
by M. GUSTAVE DOUÉ? Describes the Demon of the Cape?

"Off with his head!" said Кшо RICHARD. "They 're off!"

too soon; you must start 'em again. Like a door on its hind-
legs, so he
"Too late now?" Stuff, nonsense! never too late. You
want to know who is the real Winner of the Derby? Well,
I am a gentleman, if ever there was one, and I apologise,
d'avance, for mentioning such a name to you, or in connection
with nonsense. Still, it is no secret, for I was in the House
of Lords, and beard what was said, and saw how gratified he
looked; and well he might look gratified. The real Winner
of the Derby is the Lady who, it has been announced, allies
herself to the Nobleman formerly advantageously known аз
LORD STANLEY, and I humbly aud respectfully offer my con-
gratulations on the arrangement.
I think I have read you a lesson, my noble Father, about
teasing me for a 1'rophecy.
COLUMBUS IN THE CALENDAR.
The North German Correspondent announces that "the
beatification of CHRISTOPILEB COLUMBUS, of which there
was some talk a few years ago, seems now about to be
carried through in good earnest." We are advised by an
ancient sage to call no man happy before his death.
COLUMBUS has been dead 304 years. Should his beatifica-
tion be pronounced now, it will exemplify a customary
pontifical extension of the old philosopher's rule to an
extreme. Centuries generally elapse after the death of a
Saint before he is enrolled amongst the beatified at Home.
"Call no man happy until long after his death" appears to
be the papal maxim as touching beatification.
To the foregoing announcement is added the suggestion
that little difficulty will probably occur in proving the one
or two miracles which are de rigueur in all caaes of the
kind in question. One alone, we should think, will suf-
fice in the case of COLUMBUS; and the discovery of Ame-
rica hud the great advantage of being a fact.
Tufts Tailing Off!
ONLT seven fellow-commoners have been matriculated
for 1869-70, to 530 pensioners. It is a comfort to think
there is at least, »ne race which is not in vogue at the
'Varsity—the "race of fellow-commoners!" They will
soon be "fellow-uncommoners." The sooner the better.
Here's to the last "tuft," and may he end by being
plucked, as " tufts" should be!

HINTS FOR CONVERSATION. (DERBY DAY.)
v DRAB ia at the door. You
have your Fortnum and
Mason, your six-ounce over-
coat, your cerulean vei|,
your betting-book, your bi-
nocular. You want some-
thing more—a few hints for
conversation with those
charming combinations of
Nature and expensive milli-
nery, who go with you to
share your hopes, and fears,
and lunch, on this the Derby
Day of 1S70.
We will see, as in previous
years, whether the names of
the horses which figure in
the betting (some of them
at a very low figure) will
supply any materials for talk
on the road, and the rail,
and the course.
Mncgregor,—Beaten out of
the field at starting. Every-
thing that it is possible to
say about the favourite has
1 .чти said already in the best,
the raciest manner, not in
Baily, nor in Bell, nor yet in Ruff'» Guide to the Turf; but in a novel,
one of "SCOTT'S lot," which, as these "Hints," happily for you, will
be in your hands on Tuesday afternoon, you will have ample, lime to
read before the hour for conversation arrives; but remember, when
you buy, or borrow, or hire the book, you must not ask for îlacgreyor,
but for Rob Roy.
Camel.—The first time this useful animal has been entered for com-
petition at Epsom. Great curiosity is felt about his running. A very
spirited act on the part of the Council of the Zoological Society. You
have often seen him in their Gardens on a Sunday. But is he not
rather more than three years old, and would not a desert be the proper
arena for him F His friends, however, do not seem to desert him, for
he is high up in the betting, and we run no risk in saying that it will
be to their behoof if Camel wins.
Sunshine.—Glad this horse was not named "Moonshine," for then we
should have been left without a ray of hope. (Fs this astronomically
correct F The Astronomer Royal is probably in bed or in the clouds
by this time, and we do not like to disturb him.) Sunshine cheers us
(no doubt about thai): in return we will cheer Sumhine, if successful.
Prince of Vales.—One of the most remarkable coincidence» that
could possibly happen would be for the PBINCB OF WALES to be pre-
sent, and see the Prince of Wales fly past the Judge's chair first
between three and four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon.
Bridgicater.—\\, is settled that if any accident should prevent this
horse from running, he is not to be said to be "scratched," but, with
a delicate reference to a borough now in trouble, "disfranchised.
Kinf craft.—Defined as the art of governing ;" an accomplishment
there is but little doubt Klngcraffs jockey will show he possesses.
Palmerston.—Ought to be first—to be Premier. At all events, it will
be very strange if he does not get a place; and if Temple should be
close up to him, there will be another remarkable coincidence.
Normanby.—It will be vast.ly convenient for the Turf poets if this
horse should win, for Normanby would rhyme so well with Thormanby,
victorious at Epsom some years ago.
King p' Scots.—We hope there is in the profession a jockey of the
name of PHELPS.
Cymbal.—Sounds well, but then, unfortunately, a cymbal is made to
be beaten. (Afraid this has been said before of a quadruped with a
similarly suggestive name.)
Stanley.—Excuse the old, old quotation: it is irresistible. We will
never do so again :—
"On, STANLEY, on!"
Recorder.—If this steed (used as a variation, to avoid too much
tautology) should take the Stakes, there will he a general exclamation
of surprise, assuming, it may be expected, the shape of "Law, you
don't say so!"
Astolfo.—Cousin to ORLANDO (see CHARLEY MAINE and HARRY
OSSTO), and Orlando is on the roll of Derby winners, and talent runs in
families.
DEFINITION Oí THE DERBY.
NOBODY now thinks about the (Ecumenical Council. Everybody's
mind is occupied with the (Ecumenical Horse-Race.
BEWARE OF THE TRAINS!
No one more than Mr. Punch, admires the pretty short costumes
which now adorn our parks, and promenades and croquet parties; and
no one more than Mr. Punch detests the odious long dresses, which,
trip him up whene'er he takes his walks abroad, in London here at
home. There is a right place for everything, and a long dress in a
drawing-room is becoming, and in place. But я long dress out of
doors, and draggling in the dust, is becoming only in the fact of its
becoming such a nuisance, that the comfort of mankind demands its
abolition. Mr. Punch has an idea that ladies rather like their dresses
to be trampled on, as it affords them an excuse for turning sharply
round and attracting an attention which they otherwise might miss.
At any rate, he never scruples to tread upon a train when it is trailed
across his path, and he never condescends to offer an apology for the
damage he inflicts. Other men, however, have not his sell-command,
and nervously apologise for what is not their fault.
Certainly it is not pleasant to stumble over a long skirt, and then be
scowled at just as though you deserved to be well horsewhipped. But
ladies strut along defiant, like an Irishman at Oonnybrook, and seem
to challenge men to tread upon the tail of their long dress. So Mr.
Punch feels neither pity nor compuuction when he does so, and indeed
his sole rejoices when it tears a fine new train. Slimmer men, how-
ever, are both mentally and bodily upset by such an accident, and
results not wholly laughable have more than once occurred. The public
clearly ought to be protected from such casualties, or it will soon be
hardly safe to walk along the streets. Suicide through wearing crino-
line has been frequently committed; and women may do manslaughter
by wearing a long skirt. If ladies wear long dresses in order to look
killing, by tripping up a passer-by they actually may be so. Really,
while this foolish fashion lingers in our streets, a notice should be
placarded at every crowded crossing, bidding all who pass there to
Beware of the Trains!"
ECONOMY FOR LADIES.
NOTIONS of economy are sadly out, of fashion with those who write
about the fashions; but here is a delightful exception to the rule :—
"So little marked and various is the prevailing mode, that ladies who have
kept their dressée of last summer muy, without attracting notice, wear them
again this."
Happy the man who, free from care, flndeth his wife content will
wear the dresses she last season bought, and this year troubleth him
for nought! May sho be merry in her old clothes, for they are far
cheaper than new! What a darling duck a wife must be, who can live
for some sii months or so without, dipping her bill for drapery into her
poor husband's pocket! Such little ducks will, when they moult their
fine feathers of the summer, put them carefully away to be ready for
next year. If they be not little geese, they will never fear the danger
of attracting foolish notice by the fact that their plumage is a little
out of fashion, for this to any man of sense who happens to observe it
will simply be a proof of the admirable prudence wherewith it has been
kept.
Variety is not Charming.
IN an article liberally upholding the University Tests Abolition Bill,
the Times asks :—
"Is .England an irreligious nation? Are we in any danger of becoming
Positiviste because of the variety of religious denominations?"
No; but a people whose souls were less devoted to business than
ours are, and who had leisure to trouble themselves about doctrinal
considerations, might be in some danger of becoming Negativists.
To your Potts! My Public.
MR. SCODAHOBE appeals to all sensible people to protect the tele-
graph apparatus. It seems that idiot boys, and more idiotic men of the
"rough species, are in the habit of making cockshies of the insulators.
Now the working of the telegraph is transferred to St. Martin's-le-
Grand, we cannot conceive a more legitimate "postage duty" lhan
that of handing over to condign punishment all mischievous fools,
young or old, found shying at the telegraph posts, or damaging telegraph
wires.
Entertainment for lian and Beast.
DUE arrangements have been made, we are glad to see, by Privy
Council Order, for " watering" beasts travelling oy railway. Query ц
the "beasts" for whom "watering" on a journey compulsory pro-
vision is most needed, are the four-legged ones P By the beasts we
have had most reason to complain of—however fond of " liquoring up"
—" water " is about the last refreshment likely to be asked for.

PUNCH'S DERBY PROPHECY.

As usual, the Great Creature was more extraordinarily right than ever; and, if you thiuk this
sentence objectionable, the amount of care he feels is infinitesimal. But wasn't he p Every other
Prophet, from the highly-educated gentlemen who describe a race daintily (and some of them do
it тегу graphically indeed, besides quoting Latin), down to the touts and cads who send tips,
declared not only that Maegrcgor (behold his fcirtaned likeness^would win, but that nothing else
had any chance. Did Mr. Punch lend himself to that fatal delusion? Not he. Even in the grave
and solemn article, wherein ho humbly and timidly
describes the awful doiugs in the High Court of Par-
liament, he said,—
"And now, as regards Macgregor, it is certain
that -"
The exigencies of publication required that he
should here break off, out he continued, though un-
reported,—
"this vaunted horse will not only not win, but
will not even be placed."
Well, did he win? ЛУаз he placed? Or was this
the telegram ?—
Kingcraft ...... 1
Palmct'ston . . . . 2
Munter 3
But was this all? Punch not only named the
Winner, in his magnificent and coherent Prophecy,
but, — look at his picture last week,—his grand
Cartoon. Look, we say, with both your eyes, and
say whether the Artist did not
Spot the Winner!
MUSIC.
As an answer to all Correspondents, we beg
to inform them that MR. ARTHÜB S. SULLIVAN
¡з lecturing at the South Kensington Museum.
The Lectures are "On. Music," and, not ex-
tempore, but from his own notes. Those Ladies
and Gentlemen who hare taken tickets in the
hopes of hearing the talented composer sing bis
entire Oratorio, The Prodigal Cox and Box, right
through from beginning to end, with imitations
of drum and trumpet passages, have expected
too much, and ought not to complain of disap-
pointment. We are authorised to state that as
the Lectures have no avowed political object,
therefore, the gentleman who took away some-
body's umbrella "by mistake" is requested to
return it as soon as possible.
BLACKHEATH AND THE BOARD OF WORKS.
CERTAIN Witches in Macbeth, as performed with Witches additional
to the Weird Sisters, sing, finely although in words other than those of
the divine WILLIAMS, to music traditionally called MATTHEW LOCKE'S;
brave music no matter whose :—
"We '11 have a dance upon the heath."
On which announcement one speaking as »Clown of that WILLIAMS'
creation might ask, "Marry, how shall ye, an your heath be enclosed?"
Now the possibility of dancing on the heath called Blackheath appears
to be in danger, from the fact that a large meeting was held there the
other evening with a view to take measures against its threatened
enclosure. The occasion of this concourse was one which might almost
have excused such a gathering as that once convened on the same site
—for Hyde Park was not then practicable—by JACK CADE. But the
President of this Assembly was DE. W. С. BENNETT, who stated
that :—
"By the bill now sought to be obtained by the Metropolitan Board of
Works he found that it was proposed to invest that Board with the power of
enclosing any portion of the heath they cboee, and also that power would Ьв
given to prevent the assembling of persons for what was termed ' brawling
and shouting.'"
As regards these powers which the Board of Works is seeking to
obtain from the Legislature, let us hope we shall find that :—
"The House of Commons granted half their prayer;
The other half the winds dispersed in air.''
To prevent the assemblage of persons for what is termed, doubtless
in mild language, brawling and shouting, is a power which by all means
let the Board of Works obtain, if they can enforce it, and will. But
the power of enclosing any portion of the heath they choose is what
may be called altogether another pair of shoes. May their solicitation
for this power to spoil a common be referred by the Commons' House
to a Select Committee consisting of /IJolus and his aerial subjects; and
may the wild winds, having scattered it, continue to sweep over Black-
heath as wild, or at least preserved, as DA. BENNETT said, "in its
present natural open wildness."
A BEAUTIFUL PARLIAMENT.
WHEN lovely women are entrusted with the franchise, it may fairly
be presumed that, in their choosing of a Member to vote for them in
Parliament, the Eyes will often have it. The man of handsome face
will pretty surely gain their countenance. It will matter very little if
a candidate have brains, provided only he has beauty.
N ow, as women far outnumber men, their votes will be decisive in
deciding an election, in the good time coming, that is, of universal
female suffrage. Therefore, candidates will chiefly aim to captivate the
ladies, and will put on their best looks on the eve of an election.
Indeed, as looks, not words, may be expected to have influence, we
may live to see the day when, instead of putting forth an elaborate
address, stating with distinctness his political opinions, a would-be
Member will content himself with issuing his photograph. This will
say more in his favour than any other eloquence, especially if lie be
gifted with a speaking countenance.
Ugly men, of course, will shrink from competition; and the battle at
the poll will go with the best looking. The Ladies' Man will gain the
day at each election; and what a Book of Beauty will Hansard not
become when every speech therein recorded is adorned, for female
reference, with the Member's carle de vitiie! Plain speakers will be
quite unknown in the assemblage. Every M.P. will be either a Nar-
cissus or Adonis. "Handsome is," not "bandeóme does," will be their
only qualification. The best-looking man of all will be perpetually
the Premier : and, in short, the House of Commons will have to change
its title to the House of the Uncommons.
Another of our Institutions in Peril.
Ts something dreadful going to happen to our Footmen? Does
Reform threaten even them!1 What is in danger Г Their meals or
their plnsb, or their perquisites P Some terrible calamity must be
hanging over their powdered heads, fora deputation from "TheLivery
Committee" have liad an interview with MR. GÖSCHEN!
KOLLI SECUNDTJS.
THE dinner of the Coldstreams reminds us of their admirable anti-
duelling proclamation. "Nobody 's Second."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

AT 21тн. Tuesday. Having retired from the House
of Commons, in displeasure at the affront offered
to the Reporters, for whom he will ever "tight,
until his waggish eyelids can no longer wag" (able
Editors will please insert line in Hamlet, amended),
and having casually mentioned that Margregor would not win the
Derby (he did not), Mr, Punch necessarily omitted to mention what
had not happened at the time of his writing. When the Reporters
re-entered, they were loudly cheered from all parts of the House.
"An affront handsomely acknowledged becomes a favour," says
SHERIDAN. Smoothing his brow, therefore, and resuming that beaming
smile, never more exquisitely rendered than in last week's Cartoon
(which also predicted the appearance of Мл. GLADSTONE at the Derby,
and the Premier was present), Mr. Punch proceeds to record that,
MR. THOMAS HUQHES, boy-beloved Brown, brought in a Bill to
amend the laws relating to Horse Racing. lie showed that the Jockey
Club had not the power—if it had the will—to deal with betting and
premature racing. He wished to abolish the running of two-year-olds,
to withhold the Queen's Plates from anything under four years old,
and to bring persons under the wrath of the Betting Act who took
deposits for bets. The debate was not so amusing as it might have
been made. LORD ROTSTON blushed (he said) that Parliament should
discuss such trumpery matters, and thought that a horse was an
animal (even Mr. Saucers allowed this), and that a man having a
property in his animal, ought to do as he pleased with it. Nor did he
see harm in betting among the lower orders, not even in that of house-
maids and kitchen-maids. MR. GUEST thought Tattersall's ought to
be abolished, and that the newspapers ought not to publish the odds.
MR. BERNAL OSBORNE thought the time of the House was wasted
over such a matter. Abstractedly, there may be something in this;
but considering that the House does not refuse to listen to a complaint
that a hedge-breaking tramp has had a couple of days' imprisonment,
Imperial time might oe spared to a subject which is interesting, as the
1'riends of the turf vaunt, to the Million. The HOME SECRETARY
was for leaving racing matters to the Jockey Club, but said that
Government would do its best against betting. (Tue promise was
partly redeemed, rather promptly, for the list-men were driven from
the Derby.) Mi. HUGHES got leave by 132 to 44 to bring in his Bill.
MR. AYRTON made another contribution to Art. He managed some-
thing which a less skilful practitioner could hardly have accomplished.
Ministers have the most powerful majority that a Government has pos-
sessed since the days of PITT; and MR. ATRTON to-night actually
contrived to have MR. GLADSTONE'S Administration defeated by a
majority of 13. It was on that Kensington Road question—the giving
away (almost) some most valuable land, and removing line trees. The
House refused to nominate a Committee on the Bill. Of course,
attempt will be made to get the Vote rescinded. Now, Mr. Punch, as
he has frequently remarked, is incarnate justice. He has rather dis-
tinctly expressed his opinion of MR. AYRTON as an Art-Minister and
,Kililr, and eren conveyed that opinion pictorially last week. But in
this matter of the Road, MR. AYRTON is not altogether to be con-
demned. He inherited the scheme, he did not invent it. And there is
an Invisible Screw—patent enough to the far-glancing eyes of Mr.
Punch. No more at present, but a great deal more presently (Englieh
word, not Scottisu) bhould it be necessary. Just now, Mr. Punch
believes the Ministerial idea is to let the matter rest; but when the
Session shall be nearly over, and Members shall be tired and careless,
somebody will say to somebody with a Happy Thought, " Now, Old
Cockalorum, we '11 bustle 'em somehow." Now, as Mit. DISRAELI says
in one of his earlier novels, " Cocky is a very good Cocky, and ' Bustle
is a very good horse," but he must not run on Kensington turf.
Wednesday. Second Reading, by 137 to 56, of a Bill for enabling a
clergyman of the Church of England to doff his pastoral robe, if he
(inds it of the Nessus-shirt sort. That ¡a, to let him by deed, enrolled
in Chancery, and delivered to Bishop, relinquish his spiritual vocation.
Also, if he think he should like to come back to the pulpit, he may do
so by revoking his deed. Rather a good debate. MR. HENLEY, who
has. for a most courageous man, a wonderful gifi. fur seeing lions in every
path, thought that sporting parsons would go out of orders during the
hunting season, change black for pink, and afterwards return to the
Church. Many things are possible, certainly, but a good manj possible
things never happen. The Bill is for the relief of a worthier sort of
parson than he whom MR. HENLEY sketched. Government would not
oppose the Second Reading, but added the usual reservation.
MR. PBTER TAYLOR then went at the Game Laws, which lie pro-
posed to abolish. His arguments are well known, but some of his anec-
dotes seemed to be new, and were not accepted with favour. The
smart speech of the day was by MR. STOUT, who made good sport at
MR. TAYLOR'S cost, but had more to say than smart things. He said
that if a landlord made his tenants his friends, killed the rabbits and a
good many of the hares, did not let his shooting for dirty sovereigns,
and built cottages, the labourers became Preservers. He bad educated
•1000 pheasants the year before last; and for 23 years the average of
poaching cases on his estate was only one annually. Adjourned by
motion on the part of the clock-hands.
Yes, the Adulteration of Food Bill was withdrawn, but we are
not going to let that question drop. Why the artisans do not take
it up, it is hard to say. It affects them almost exclusively—the folks
who pay the extortionate prices demanded by " high-class tradesmen"
at alt events are not cheated in the quality of the goods. Wisdom
came from the East. In the East an extra-aluminous baker's ear
makes close acquaintance with his door-post—here we give him damages
against the newspaper that calls him thief. Punch infers that Wisdom
took a return-ticket, and has used it. On the following night, LORD
EUSTACE CECIL brought up the question, and wanted Government to
undertake to deal with the law of adulteration. He and other Mem-
bers adduced cases that almost make the imperturbable Mr. Punch in-
dignant. But MR. BRUCB would only promise to "consider." Mr.
Punch jeers in ancient song, from sheer weary recklessness—
"There wiw an old man, and be bad an old cow,
And he had no victuals to give her;
So he took out his fiddle and played her a tune,
'Coniider, my cow, consider.'"
He was not a practical old man. He might have played for hire, and
bought her food, or he might have pawned his fiddle. But he was as
practical as our law-makers.
Thursday. The Commons "saw land." That is, they saw to the end
of the Irish Laud Bill, and cheered considerably over the last amend-
ment. MR. bou г, said they were parting, no doubt with many pangs,
from the Bill, but that it would be hard work to get the House back
into the blissful state of the last two months. Here it is convenient to
add, that on the following Tuesday the Bill Passed, and was sent to the
Lords, amid more cheering. This sort of " What a good boy am I"
may be natural, but we ask with tears in our eyes, is it dignified P
In one of the jolly BLACKWOOD novels of old days, there is a story
of a sentinel, to whose demand "Who goes there f " the reply was
given "Naval officer drunk in a wheelbarrow." "Pass Naval officer
drunk in a wheelbarrow." Naval officers never get drunk and ride in
wheelbarrows now, but they do what annoys their superiors a great
deal more. They use an Englishman's liberty to " write to the papers"

and raise a Clameur de Childeri—fall down on his knees on the quarter-

midshipmites with that awe and reverence they ought to feel for
their nautical superiors.
Friday. LORD GRANVILLE spuke oí the wanton, senseless, and inde-

into the American gaol—see Cartoon—and if Brother JONATHAN wishes
to heap coals of fire on our head he -will "give it'em hot "—if the
slight cplloquiality be excusable in an international communication
•whence inelegancias should be eliminated.
Nothing interesting in the Commons, except LORD EUSTACE CECIL'S
debate, already noted. Л Burials Bill, which was grimly brought on at
the witching hour of Midnight, the House resented, and divided until
it was too late to do anything but go to bed.
Monday. The Lords had a wrangle, and there was even temper
shown overthe CHANCELLOR'S Bill for Improving Judicature. Certain
Law Lords declared that it could not properly be dealt with in Com-
mittee, so they went out of the House, and the clauses were carried
in their absence. When Mr. Punch states that such peers *s LORD
CAIRNS and LORD WESTBURY were among these dissenters, it is more
generous in him than may be imagined, because he thereby precludes
himself from telling the story of the man in the gallery of the theatre,
who, displeased at a play, cried "Silence, fellows, or I '11 leave the
house," a story he would otherwise like to tell.
Touching the exclusion of strangers. MR. CHAUFURD explained
that be did hot mean to turn out the Ladies, inasmuch as all of them,
except two, had gone away as soon as they heard what subject was
coming on. But he wished to keep the discussion out of the news-
papers. In reply to which Mr. Punch takes leave to cite, with extra-
ordinary approbation, a passage from an article in the Daily News:—
'' The gentlemen in the Reporters' Gallery, who are in the daily habit of
suppressing Parliamentary nonsense and bad grammar, would not be unequal
to the suppression of Parliamentary indecency.'*
Gunners—we mean shooters at game—listen! MR. LOWE intends
to make it obligatory to take out the present Game Certificate as well
as the new Gun Licence. And Mr. Punch records with pleasure
that the Commons passed the Bill for protecting the Property and
Earnings of Married Women—let the Lords sit and do likewise.
Tuesday. (Eve of the Kingcraft Derby.) Some sharp talk in the
House of Lord s about the Bribery Commissioners, and LORD SALIS-
BURY said that the brow-beating by some of them reminded him of
JUDGE JEFFRIIS (by the way, MR. SCHARP'S National Portrait
Gallery has a full length of this judge when young, and he looks rather
an elegant and bin, nul person, somewhat bored with life, and not at
all like the "gorging fiend" he afterwards became, as represented
this year in MB. E. M. WARD'S painting, wherein he reviles BAXTER),
and a good many other severe things were said—some of them will be
noticed in India. The Lords passed the Felony Bill, so that the
family of a convict may not be exposed to the additional hardship of
becoming paupers. LORD CAIRNS gave notice that he should fight
the LORD CHANCELLOR on the Judicature Bill, and their Lordships
rose for their holidays, which end the 13th of June.
The Commons met in the morning, that is, at 2 P.M., and sat till
past 1 A.M., deducting a couple of hours for dinner. Yes, very hard
working, indeed—perhaps the next day was not the Derby Day. The
chief subject of their discussion was the Navy Estimates, into which
Mr. Punch has not the remotest intention of going, beyond saying
that about two millions of pounds sterling were voted. Having done
with the ships,
Their Commonships rose for their holidays, ending in what the mover
was pleased to call Thursday "se'nnight."
Wednesday. The Mysterious Wednesday, touching which Mr. Punch
proposes here merely to quote from one of the most spirited poems by
a bard whom Scotland ought to honour a great deal more than she
appears to do. For while hackneyed quotations from BURNS are
served up in every Scotch speech and article until one would believe
that Scotland had never owned another poet (whereas she is rich in that
matter), nobody in the North quotes HOGG. Mr. Punch will quote
him, however, apropos of the Derby :—
"MACOREQOR, MACOREOOB, our scoute have been flying.
• • • • •
Of riding and running such tidings they bear.
• * * *' *
1 Thou know'tt in thie itrife Iwas never behind.'

GLADSTONE AT THE DERBY;
"Among the faces near the I'm NCI: OF WALES was seen, for the first time,
that of Mil. GLADSTONE."—Derby Reporter».
Or what is the great man thinking, as he looks o'er rough and raff,
'Mid the roar of the ring and the buzz of the stand, ana the shouting
and slang and chaff P
Is he thinking "Was it for this the House has sacrificed a day?"
Or, "1 wonder what business / have here—and what those who see
me say?"
Or, "Is this crowd a sample of the 'country' to which I go P
Its lounging class and its labouring class—its high and middle and low P
Are these roughs what I refer to, when I talk of ' working men ' F
Is yon crowd a type of ' the masses,' and this of ' The Upper Ten ?'"
Or is he comparing the races here with those in St. Stephen's run—
The " milking " and "scratchiug" before the event, the weighing after
it 's done.
The false starts, and the jockeyship—the rush past the Judge's chair,
Nimv m-ek and neck, now with any amount of heads or lengths to
spare P
is he thinking of the thrill of pride, as the winner moves along,
Back to the scales, amid the cheers of the clamouring, crowding
throng;
And questioning which is the headiest draught, that which FRENCH will
drink to-day;
Or his own, as through Palace Yard he moves, on the eve of some
mighty fray P
Dr wondering how men so all unlike as himself and the swells around
Can breathe the same air, and wear the same clothes, and stand on the
same ground P
Or gauging Juventus Mnndi against its Senectm here,
In a parallel of the Derby with the races round Hector's bier P
Doth he sniff, complacent, in advance, or by anticipation spurn.
The incense to-morrow's newspapers will in his honour burn P
Is he here to study the sporting-men, and the mystery to explore
That still brings the flies to the spiders, and finds geese to pluck galore?
Or is he thinking of Bills to be drawn, vice Том HUGHES, by THRING,
For putting down two-year-old races, and clipping the combs of the
King?
Is he here, like a schoolmaster, scanning the back on which the rod 's
to be laid,
Ere he selects the birch-twigs of which the rod shall be made?
Or is he simply standing amazed, as a green though middle-aged man,
At the mighty, motley, crowd he has come for the first time, to-day, to
scan;
Half dazzled and half disgusted, half horrified, half enthralled,
Now cheered by the stir, and anon by the sin and rascaldom appalled P
Whatever the great man is thinking, I'm thinking as I stand near,
None has more right to an outing, or looks less like taking it here.
He, too, as a Derby favourite his public running began;
But where he will end it, who can say—he or any other man P
A Question for Ayrton.
M. VANDAL is the Director-General of the French Post Office.
Here, we have made our M. Vandal First Commissioner of Works.
People don't like asking AYRTON questions, but there is a question
for " the noble savage" suggested by this arrangement—which is most
out of plane, a Vandal presiding over a nation's Letters, or a Vandal in
authonty over its Arts P
"THE RELIGIOUS DIFFICULTY."—Long Sermons.
Fenians in Fourth Class Carriages.
THE Colonial Office received from SIR J. YOUNG, Governor General
of Canada, a telegram to the effect that the Fenians were much demo-
ralised, and were finding their way home in cattle trucks. Next to a
hurdle a cattle truck is about the most appropriate conveyance for
Fenians that can well be conceived. Persons unacquainted with mili-
tary language may wonder how it can be possible for creatures destitute
of a moral nature to be "demoralised." Fancy the state of a cattle
truck full of demoralised Fenians. It would, of course, have to be
disinfected before an owner of stock could possibly think of putting
into it a lot of any decent beasts.
An Advance.
WE read of an A.B.C. company for utilising sewage by solidifica-
tion. We are glad to see a Company for this purpose that has got as
far as the three first letters of the Alphabet. Till now, we have never
known one that even succeeded in " making its mark."
A HARD LIFB.
WHO can wonder at MR. GLADSTONE wishing for a little relaxation,
and going to the Derby, after reading that in one day (not long before
the Epsom week) he received four deputations on tlie subject of the
Education ВШ!

MRS. MALAPROP spent the Queen's Birthday very pleasantly at
Hampton Court, listening to the band of the Lancets. But one thing
rather puzzled her. Certain busts were pointed out to her as those of

yet she noticed that under every one was the word—objectionable
anywhere, but particularly so in such a place as Hamplon Court
Palace—Imp.
WHOLESALE TOBACCO-STOPPERS.
We learn that at the annual meeting of the British Anti-Tobacco
Society—
"The report asserted that the lunatic asylums were filled with persons
whose malady had been mainly produced by the use of tobacco. It also stated
that smokers were generally tipplers, and impervious to the truths of religion."
There is no great step, perhaps between insanity and atheism, for
lunatics and atheists alike are wanting reason. But the statement
that smokers are usually irreligious is not more true than the assertion
that they usually are lunatics. Either statement is as true, or it may be
as false, as the assumption that smokers are "generally tipplers ;" and
we are not surprised to und that the tobacco-stoppers should have
ended their report by sweepingly affirming that—
"The great majority of diseases afflicting mankind was produced by
smoking."
Doctors will, no doubt, attest the truth of this assertion. Everybody
knows, indeed, that scarlet fever, rheumatism, ague, gout, lumbago,
sciatica, sore-throat, neuralgia, tic-doloureux, dysentery, cholera, bron-
chitis, quinsy, asthma, toothache, small-pox, whooping-cough, and
measles, are all diseases mainly resulting from tobacco. In general
estimation merely general assertions are held of little value; but this
fact is forgotten by the Anti-Smoke Society, who never seem to shrink
from going the whole hog in their protests against pig-tail.
Beware of Pickpockets!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW HISTORY OF INVENTIONS.

ow did ladies and hair-
dressers and milliners
and sub-editors manage
•without scissors P This
is a point which has
not received sufficient
attention from the acute
metaphysician and the
keen statistician; and
yet it is an important
one, for we know, from
JOSEPHUS, who handles
the matter in his usual
trenchant style, that
many centuries came
aud went after the
needle had penetrated
domestic life, before the
meritorious little imple-
ment, of which we are
now treating, was to be
found lying in the work-
box, or depending from
the girdle of the wives
and mothers of the
middle ages.
The invention of " the
glittering forfex," like
the discovery of steam,
and printing, and portable soup, and pomatum, has been claimed by various nations,
many eras, and different individuals, with a good deal of acrimony and mutual
abuse; and at this distance of time it is impossible to determine, with any approach
to mathematical accuracy, which of the competitors has the best title to a niche ш
the Temple of Fame, and a handsome testimonial in money or plate. .
In this country alone, not to mention Silesia and the islands of the Crecían
Archipelago, the thought is said to have flashed first across the great mind 01
STEELS, in the seclusion of that sequestered cottage at Edgware, where he lived
so long undisturbed by Tattlers and unmolested by Spectators; but modern criti-
cism refuses to believe in SIR RICHARD'S pretensions, and rather pins its faith on
GRANVILLE SHABP, or LOUD CUTTS, or LORD SHEÎÏIBLD (GIBBON s inend), or
some one of the roistering blades of "the younger CHARLES'S' inventive age;
and in this envelope of uncertainty we must leave the question, believing there
will never cease to be a division of opinion upon it even in the best circles.
The Crusaders were fine fellows, and we are deeply obliged to them for the
Jerusalem Artichoke. So were the Knights of the Circular Table issuing their
invitations at Caerleon, and those "Wandering Minstrels," the Troubadours, and
the Barons who initiated a long succession of reforms on the green sward ol
Runnymede, and the Five Members, and the Seven Bishops, and the Pilgrim
Fathers, and the Doges of Venice, and the Stadtholdere; but they al), m comparison
with us polished nineteenth century men, laboured under one great disadvantage, and
had to contend with one serious drawback—they could not have their boote blacked
either in the privacy of their own homes, or at the corner of St. James s otreet.
Blacking was unknown in their days and dressing-rooms, and the bright thought
of patent leather was still wrapt in impenetrable obscurity. We know more about
Castor and Pollux, or HARMODIUS and ARISTOGEITON, than they did of DAT &
MARTIN: and in their bosoms the name of WAHREN awakened no more pleasing
recollections than that of PSAMMITICHUS would in our breasts. All honour, then,
to these benefactors to their race (MESSRS. D. & M., and MR. W.) who, in the midst
of trying times (the period of one of the French Revolutions), devoted their leisure
hours to the study ofchemistry, and produced the composition which reflects lustre
on their names, and renders us indifferent to the mud of Tottenham Court Road.
SONGS OF THE SORROWFUL:
IV.—" THJS MAN WITH HOUSE ГКОГЕВТТ."
IN happier days I often sighed
To think, alas! that 1
No stake had in the country
In the shape of property.
I had no land on which I could
Erect a house or two,
Until one day I was left six
Small cottages at Kew.
The relative who left me them
No doubt imagined he
Was doing something generous
Towards me, his legatee.
Alas! the cruel deed he did
1 trust he little knew
When he gave up to me those six
Vile cottages at Eew.
I took possession speedily,
And made the tenants quake—
Possession was for some time all
That I contrived to take.
For Number One went off one night
Just as his rent was due.
And didn't even leave the key
Of Cobden Cottage, Kew.
Then Number Two began to growl
Because his cellar damp was,
And Number Three, an aged dame—
A sort of Sairey Gamp was—
Vowed she'd not pay at all; that I
Could not induce her to;
That I might take away the doors
From VVoodbine Cottage, Kew.
I did. She stayed—at length I had
To bribe her to retreat.
At Number Four the gentleman
His wife would night.Iy beat,
Which forced poor Number Five to quit -
A tenant good and new—
The only one midst all the row
Who paid his rent at Kew.
Then as to Number Six—he seemed
A pleasant sort of man;
He paid his quarter iu advance—
A most unusual plan.
One day he went off in a cab
With two stern men in blue,
Howled at by all who lived around
Those cottages at Kew.
These tenants superseded quite
Have been by others since.
I never see an applicant
But at the sight 1 wince.
For though most satisfactory
May be our interview,
We 're bound to grow to deadly foes
In course of time at Kew.
One wants his drains attended to,
Another's bells are wrong,
A third insists on paint at once—
That is the usual song,
Combined with papering; a fourth
Goes on about the flue;
There never were such buildings as
Those cottages at Kew.
I try to meet them every way,
And take the greatest pains
To remedy the chimneys
And ameliorate the drains.
I paint, I paper—all in vain
Is everything I do:
Oh, Uncle JONES, why did you leave
Me cottages at Kew F
I built a stable at the back
Of Number Three—those frights
At Number Four declared that it
Disturbed their "ancient lights."
They are twin sisters, and to soothe
The feelings of the two
IM to reduce the rent five pounds,
Of Crabtree Cottage, Kew.
Ye who have sighed for "house and lands"
Pray warning take by me,
And never hope an uncle will
Leave you " house property."
But if you 're anxious to invest,
Much pleasure will accrue
By purchasing my charming six
Small cottages at Kew.

"THE CHURCHMAN ARMED AGAINST THE ERRORS OF THE TIME."
REVEREND AND JOLLY OLD MB. HOODWINK, OUR COUNTRY RECTOR, HAS (OF COURSE) COMB UP FOB тнв MAY MEKTINOS; BUT
HE MANAGED TO HUN DOWN TO THE ÜEHBY (IN A BLACK TlE), AND HERB HE FINISHES THE WEEK BY WINNING HONOURS WIFH HIS
CLBVER COB, AT THB IIOJIKK SHOW, WHERE HB PASSES FOR, AT LEAST, A SWELL STUD-GROOM.
SPOILED GOODS.
THE defeat of Jfacgregor in the Derby was a great loss to the joke-
makers as well as to the bookmakers, fully prepared to make a most
improper use of MB. MBBBY'S name, they were reluctantly compelled
to return home with several jokes in their heads unused; and not even
on the Oaks Day had they the much wished-for opportunity of dealing
out these choice samples of wit and humour.
We know, on unimpeachable authority, that had Macgregor won,
these amusing and original persons meant to have said, t hut wherever
they went on the course their eves rested on a Merry party; and to
have eclipsed this brilliant remark by the overpowering observation, that
everybody seemed bent on a regular good Merrymaking, with the
addition of a hint to the festal revellers, that it were good to be Merry
and wise. Some of the more literary spirits had ready a quotation
from BYRON (see the And« of Abydos) to the effect, that "All went
Merry as a marriage bell,"—it was impossible to introduce this extract
from his works on Friday after the success of Gamos—and the more
hardened offenders would have gone the length of declaring that from
first to last the conduct of the possessor of Margregor and Sunshine had
been highly Meritorious.
As it was, the dispirited jokesters ventured on nothing more striking
than a comment on the thousands of persons whose Merriment was
spoilt for the day at 3.23 P.M. with s contemptuous reference to their
thoughts being anything but Merrythoughts. The only other attempt
made was a hazy sort of calculation as to the number of disappointed
people who were at that moment saying, with Othello, "1 am not
Merry," or expressing their disbelief in the possibility of the existence
of any such character as Mr. Merryman.
A Great and Good Fainter.
SIB EDWIN LANDSEEB was humanely right in what he said at the
Annual Meeting of the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. Cropping a dog's ears is "a cruel and injurious practice"—
one which we hope will never crop up again.
A LOSS TO ANCIENT NICHOLAS.
JUDICIOUSLY criticising an injudicious judgment upon an appeal
from a recent decision in the Probate and Divorce Court—a judgment
opposed to common sense and to the opinion of the LORD CHIEF
BABÓN, the Times quotes, as illustrative of the spirit in which judges
trained to the Common Law are given to adjudicate on legal questions,
the saying of LORD KENYOH'S:—" If we take to considering equities,
we are lost." Just so. In any case of legal doubt the safe side, in the
view of your thorough lawyer, is the side of iniquity. He feels that,
by taking the just side, he would be in so far lost to the service of that
personage whose name is borne by that celebrated Corps euphemisti-
cally entitled the Inns of Court Volunteers.
Aphrodite's New Accomplishment.
CAN you imagine Venus smoking, and smoking, too, not a delicate
cigarette, not a mild cigar, but—a pipe F Distressing as the revelation
may be, there is too good reason for believing that the Goddess
of Love and Beauty did indulge in tobacco; for in a newspaper notice
of the Exhibition of Fans, now open at the South Kensington Museum,
we read that the subject painted on one of the pretty specimens m the
Collection is "Venus coming from the Meerschaum "—probably after
a symposium on Olympus with some fast young gods.
Chancery Logic.
A LEA к NE n Vice-Chancellor, protesting against the union of Law
and Equity, declared (after a recent banquet) there was "as much
difference between them as between the Army and the Navy." Un-
happily, we don't "follow you. Sir." A union of land and sea forces is
usually a means to success. The lawyer's alligator is somewhat head-
strong. He has " leave to amend."

SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
WE are wiser than our ancestors, with their witches and their warlocks,
And their ghosts that whipped through key-holes, and their spirits that
laughed at door-locks,
And the exorcists who laid them, with bell and book and candle,
And the miracle-mongering monk, who on the flend's neck set his
sandal.
We have ceased to believe in alchemy, transmutation, and astrology:
And we don't say " Stop !" to Science, when it contradicts theology:
And HUXLEY has no need to fear BRUNO'S fate, or GALILEO'S,
And primary cells and nerve-force veneramur ¡icai Dem.
Of the marches of mind and morals, we esteem the march of mind
most;
And our motto in life and business is " Devil take the hindmost!"
And we 've discovered a talisman called " Competitive Examination,"
To draw our collective wisdom to the service of the nation:
And our women are all on the gui vive, with the men in active hos-
tilities,
For doing away with the differences of sex, and its disabilities;
And LADT AMBERLEY lectures, and PROÍESSORINN FAWCETT preaches,
That males have exclusive right to not even so much as breeches.
Labour's at odds with Capita], man with woman, matter with mind-
To prove that if two folks ride on a horse, neither ought to ride behind.
And so nicely we 've balanced Self-government against Centralisation,
Each neutralises the other, and bota are in stagnation.
Here 's HOME in Belgravian drawing-rooms flies by miracle up to the
ceiling:
And carries hot coals on pate or palm, no inconvenience feeling
And the hands of the departed calls up underneath the table,
Which to put a cheque ¡uto his, now and then—if the Court would let
them—are able.
And here's DB, NEWTON, out-Homing Horns, and curing folks'
diseases,
Giving blind and dumb, and deaf and halt, eyes, ears, tongues, legs as
he pleases:
By laying his hands upon them, and bidding their ailments begone,
And doing it all for love, and not money—the downy one!
And for all our march of intellect, and our monarchy of mind.
There 's never a Reynard the Fox, but he draws his tail of fools behind;
And there 's never a quack that quacks, but he finds green geese to
echo his quacking.
And never a swindler that lowers his trawl, and finds the flat-fish
lacking!
Police Notice.
Mr. Punch berça to apprise a certain class of correspondent that he
has already received 117 letters, containing what is considered by the
writers a joke on the name of "Qamos," the winner of the Oaks, who
is of course called a " game 'ose." He will place any future epistles
of the kind in the hands of the police. It may be convenient to add,
that a Magistrate is not at liberty to bail such offenders.

OUR NIGGER HIGHWAYMEN.
_ AMERICA, a while ago, was troubled by the Blacks, and just now we
in London are pestered by the Lamp-Blacks. Sham niggers flock to
town on their journey to the races, and make it their head-quarters for
a chief part of the season. From Camberwell to Highgate, from Ken-
sington to Hackney, there is scarcely to be found a so-called quiet
street but all day long it echoes with the rattling of the bones and the
twanging of the banjo. Policemen are in vain appealed to for relief.
Their sympathies are mostly on the side of the street minstrels. In
the ears of cooks and housemaids such music finds much favour, and
it is a weakness of the Force to obey their fair enslavers. So they let
the black-faced banjo-players bellow as they please, and do not even
beg of them to warble tootlo voce.
Unvexed by the Police, the Blacks infest a street until they have
levied some black mail from its inhabitants. This having been ex-
acted, the brigands then proceed to pillage the next street, levelling
their banjos at the ears of all its inmates. Surely, thus extorting
шопеу is a sort of highway robbery, and ought to be punished by a
sufficient penalty. Fifty years ago suspected highwaymen were hung;
rt was death to be seen upon the highway with one's face blacked.
What a blessing it would be if such were now the case! Only make
it penal to be seen with a blacked face, and, though infested still by
organ-grinders, German band-its, bagpipe-squealers, fiddlers, fluters,
howlers, harpers, horn-blowers, and other noisy ruffians, our highways
would, at least, be freed from nigger highwaymen.
Wales in Ireland.

FIGARO'S "FOLLE JOURNEE."
Linie, like truth, is a dangerous game. The world's ready belief of
the lie often proclaims its opinion of the liar. The French Fiyarp,
by the announcement that he had sold himself to the Republicans, in
a number made up of forged articles purporting to be from famous
Republican hands—has sold not only the Parisian gobemouches, but the
Times and other sober English organs of opinion.
Figaro cares little about selling other papers: his real object, of
course, was to sell Figaro; and this he has done, to the tune of 150,000
copies.
Such a success shows not only the ability of the hoax, but its pro-
bability.
Who would believe that Punch had sold himself—say, to the Protec-
tionists, or the Ritualists, to WHALLET and NEWDEOATE, or MAN-
NING and the Propaganda, to HARDY and hot Toryism, or the Right
Honourable BENJAMIN Lernt M R—even though he proclaimed the trans-
action in leaded type, and imitated ever so well the fire of the great
guns—breech-loaders, charged from behind—of Protection, Pries) craft,
Protestant intolerance, Romanist retrogression, Tory indignation, or
Tory education P
Great Boon to Birmingham.
THERE is no truth in the rumour that a subscription has been set on
foot in Birmingham for the purpose of adorning that city with a Statue
of MR. LOWE. It is, however, probable that a deputation of gunsmiths
will wait upon the CHANCELLOR or THE EXCHEQUER, and present the
Right Honourable Gentleman with a verbal testimonial of their grati-
tude for the boon which he will confer upon their trade by imposing a
tax on fire-arms.

Hough ostlers. Grooms
in various stages ol

labels up befoie you, an-
nouncing the way to the
Lavatory for a "Wash
and Brush-up," indicating
the right hand; "Thin
way to the Lavatory" on
another placard close by
it, with an index-hand
point ing towards the left. "Thii way to the Gents'Lavatory," says a third card, which
you have some difficulty in reading, owing to its having swung from the horizontal into the
perpendicular, and its index-finger being now pointed towards the ground; as much as to
hint that, if you dug deep enough, you might come upon the "Gents' Lavatory" in some
niid region of underground earth, only familiar to us in connection with the first scenes
nf pantomimes, and sensational pictures of a coal-mine. Horses' stalls all the way down.
Refreshment-stalls chiefly remarkable for brilliant glass and fair Peris, at a distance, and for
dry sandwiches, yesterday's spongecakes, fairly iced claret-cup, and got-up barmaids, with
disillusioning hands and perky manners when you come close, and tempt such goods as the
goddesses provide. Walk round. Inspect horses. Get in groom's way. Beg pardon of
a man with a pail, who nearly knocks you over. Listen to conversation between groom
and stud-groom. Give it up. Inspect more horses. Inspect ponies. Wonder which you'd
choose for yourself. Feel dusty and hot. Try refreshment-stall. Ask when anything's
going on P Nobody knows. See small line of crowd round circus. Horses with numbers on
their breast-plates are ridden round. Boy offers Catalogue. Buy it. Join crowd by circus.
Horse in circus takes to kicking the partition. Leave crowd in consequence. Horse being
ridden from circus to stable, or from stable to circus, also takes to kicking. Get out of his way
by backing on the crowd. Horse, at same time, in circus rears and frightens other horses,
which back on to the crowd, and against me. Every one, horses included, seems to be back-
ing and kicking and plunging. Decide upon reserved seats. Five shillings. Askwhenany-
thing's going to begin? Nobody knows. Stall-keeper doesn't know. Get a reserved seat;
and sit in front, where one can see the Prince and Princess of Wales—when they come.
Their seats are all arranged. Crowd increasing. Capital position, if you could only stretch
your legs, or get up comfortably, or do anything except sit as if you "d been hammered in to
the place where the chair is, aud had stuck there, Foresee difficulties when the seats are
all filled. More circus work. Exhibition of stallions careering. Exhibition of harness
horses in carriages. As you can't hear the wheels or the hoofs, the effect is uncommonly
dull. One result of looking at all this, for an hour and a half, is to cause hunger. If I leave
the seat, shall I regain it? Certainly, man says, if numbered. Doubt as to which refresh-
ment stall to go to; or whether it isn't better to try a dinner at 2i. 6d. Too hot for dinner
at 2.». Gd. Take claret cup iced, and dry sandwiches, topping up with sponge cake, and a

seat. Very full by now. Much hotter. Much dustier. Much more mushroomy. Join

to stall-keeper. Compromise. I take one lower down. More directly opposite H.R.H. I
remark to a neighbour that this is luck. He says, Why P H.R.H.'s aren't coming.
Ask (as he appears to be well informed) when anything is going to happen? (By this /
mean jumps with probable accidents aud excitement). He replies, about four o'clock.
It is just two. Wish more than ever there was a clown, or a band. More people.
More badly dressed ladies than 1 've ever seen anywhere. Am seated over several foreigners,
who have come here by mistake, thinking it is a part of the Derby. Am hungry again.
Foresee dyspepsia, after Bath buns. Reserved seats full now. More altercation. Apparently
1 've got every one's seat. Hotter and hotter. Ladies talk of fainting in the back seats,
so that 1 may hear them aud ойкг them mine in front. No. Big man on my right. Big
woman on my left. Am jammed in. Big man keeps jumping up, and recognising other big
men below. He is an habitué, and knows the horses and their riders. Big woman keeps
dropping her fan between her seat and mine.
Man behind me with a party, which he keeps
turning from one side to the other to address,
puts his kuees into my chair-bank. Hunters
cnme in. Big man jumps up, "Hullo, there's
Том RIGBÏ!" Friend says, "So it is!" Big
man jumps up again, nearly knocking off my
hat, "There's Old DICK MASON!" Another
minute after, " Why, there 's JOHN DYKE !" as if
he hadn't expect ed to see him. He knows nobody
without a Christian name. He points out SIR
WATKIN WYNN, LORD COVENTRY, and LORD
FITZHARDINGE. Itry to point these out to the old
lady, but confuse them. Horses going perpetually
round and round make one as bilious as thathead-
acliing game, the" wheel of life," where little
black and red figures rotate monotonously.
Great number of Parsons here: all with Ladies.
"Ladies to right, of them: Ladies to leftof them.
Up conies the Curate." Old gentleman (with
the party) behind me, stands suddenly up and
stretches over me. "Hallo, SIMPSON !" he cries
out to a clergyman below. SIMPSON looks up,
and nods cheerfully. He is evidently taking
a holiday. The old gentleman goes on, wag-
gishly, "Where 's your wife?" SIMPSON
blushes down to his white tie, smiles feebly,
and passes on. The Ladies with the various
clergymen are asking them their opinions on the
horses, which they give with great satisfaction to
themselves. Jumping begins. More heat. More
excitement. Big Lady says to her daughter,
niece, or companion, " If there 's an accident,
I shall faint." Cheering. Leaps. Jumps.
Accident or two. Jeers. Cheers. Hotter and
hotter. Struggle out of seat at six o'clock. Shins
hurt. Coat covered with dust. Trousers with
white marks; where they came from you can't
find out. Hat's got, somehow, mysteriously
brushed the wrong way, and thickly coated
with the dust peculiar to circuses. Stagger
through crowd into open air. No cabs. Omni-
buses full. Water-carts been sufficiently at
work to make it mnddy where it isn't horribly
dusty. Walk greater part of way home, as none
of the 'busses you try to take, appear to be "goin g
your way." Have walked so far, not worth
bussing or cabbing it now. Very tired. Head-
ache. Loss of appetite. Late for dinner.
Bilious to-morrow. Real enjoyment! National
show.
Real Enjoyment for the Groom.—Mount a horse.

MYSTERIOUS CALLINGS.
AT we remark ?—we
will—that one half
of the world does
not know how the
(it her half—works.
Do you doubt the
correctness of this
assertion? Look at
a list of trades pub-
lished in the Times,
a few days ago, in
nn article, on the In-
dustrial Divisions of
t lie International
Exhibition to be held
in London next
j ear, and ask your-
self whether a tole-
nibly large per-cent-
age of these occu-
pations, in which
thousands of your
lüllow-men are en-
Raged every day, are
not as utterly un-
known to you as the
sources of the Irra-
waddy, or the Chari-
table Institutions of
the Moon? We will select a few, adding appropriate comments :—
Beaver-Cutters.— The only instance of cruelty in the list. (But Qy.
as to the " Stripes Manufacturers.")
Calenderers.—Here, of course, is a misprint; and yet it is difficult to
see how the employment of those who are engaged in the preparation
of almanacs, calendars, &c., can, with propriety, be classed amongst
"Woollen Trades."
Mungo Merchants.—A handsome reward is offered to any one who
will give such information as may lead to the detection of this article
of commerce. We think there is a Saint Mungo; we know that
MUNGO PARK was very familiar to us in our boyhood; but beyond this
we cannot get.
Plainback Manufacturers.—We have long known what wonderful
people there were in the manufacturing districts, but we confess that
this proof of their possessing the creative faciijty does come upon us
by surprise. But why, why, with such a power in their hands, cannot
they make handsome backs? There are too many plain ones
already in society.
Begatla Manvfaclurers.—Would be invaluable at Cowes, or, indeed,
at any of the head-quarters of our leading Yaclit Clubs. Now. we don't
despair of meeting with Horse-Race Manufacturers and Cricket-Match
Makers.
Scribbling Millars.—No—this is a trade which certainly must not
be encouraged. There are too many writers already. Once allow this
precedent, and the bakers and the butchers and the greengrocers will
all turn scribblers. The millers ought to know better.
Shag Manufacturers.—In the tobacco line f
Lotting Manufacturers.—This is the business we will invest our
spare capital in. No fear of bankruptcy or composition with creditors;
no mills running short time; no nps and downs; but good, solid, per-
manent transactions—all profit and no risk.
Zebra Dress Manufacturers. — On application at the Zoological
Gardens we learn that there is no demand there for articles of clothing
of this description. Perhaps animals confined in travelling menageries
may require them. The officers of the Society have kindly promised to
make further inquiry.
Blue Manufacturers.—In other words, manufacturers who, when
times are bad, are said to look blue.
Cud-bear Manufacturers.—This animal is not known at the Gardens.
The Council would be very glad to receive a specimen for exhibition.
(Perhaps a misprint for cub bear ?)
Flyer Maters—The Aeronautic Society will be delighted.
Mule Maters,—Well, we are glad commercial enterprise has not
speculated in asses. Too many of them as it is.
Weavers' Mail Makers,—Not one person in ten thousand can have
known before that the peaceful weaver pursues his pacific calling
clothed in armour!
Woolley Teeth Makers.—Perhaps the most incomprehensible of all.
A Committee of Dentists is now engaged in investigating this pro-
blem. Their report will be published in a later edition.
AN AMERICAN NEWTON.
DR. NEWTON, medical thaumaturge and spiritualistic mesmeriser,
otherwise "healing medium," from America (U. S., of course), pro-
fesses to cure not only people who resort to him, but also persons at
any distance. He takes no fees, but, according to The Medium,
spiritualist weekly journal :—
"DR. NEWTON'S POUTHAITS are one shilling each. Thoee which have
been magnetised by tbo doctor are sold at two ehiltinge. The proceeds of the
stiles do not go into any private puree, but directly to the promoting of
Spiritualism in this country."
If it is believed that anybody whosoever can derive any benefit from
these portraits of DR. NEWTON except t heir original, it may be credited
that DR. NEWTON himself derives noue. Cela va sans dire. These
pictures may save trouble and time thrown away. In all probability
DR. NEWTON'S magnetised portraits are just as efficacious in the cure
of any disease as his mesmeric passes are, and his simple portraits
equally remedial with those to which he has imparted magnetism. It
is thus in the power of anybody, who believes in DR. NEWTON'S
therapeutic energies, to obtain all the good they can do at the small
charge of one shilling; aud there can be no doubt that any sufferer
had much better invest that sum in one of DR. NEWTON'S likenesses,
which cannot harm him, than spend the money on universal pills, or
any other description of quack medicine. Even the sceptic must admit,
that he would rather louk at a photograph than swallow a pill, and will,
therefore, at least own that there will be a change somewhat for the
better in case DR. NEWTON should supersede those advertising specific
and panacea vendors of whom each is now in the enjoyment of an
extensive practice on public credulity.
The process by which DR. NEWTON magnetises his portraits is not
generally known. Perhaps it is a simple wink of the eye. According
to his believers, he heals the sick like winking. Possibly it suffices
him to magnetise his portraits by contemplating them in the eye of the
mind, and at the same time outstretching the fingers of one hand,
hilst the thumb is applied to the tip of the nose.

A CAUTION AS TO CROWDS.
A FOREIGN Gentleman, standing in a crowd, by an abrupt, and
probably nervous gesture of his hands, caused a couple of policemen to
make the mistake of taking him into custody for attempting to pick
pockets, and he was shut up at Bow Street from Saturday till Monday.
Мк. FLOWERS, in discharging him, recommended him to "avoid
crowds for the future." Good advice for ever) body who does not, wish
to be taken up as a thief, or let in for a witness. Finding himself in a
crowd, a gentleman who does not know what to do with his hands
cannot dispose of them better than by putting them in his pockets.
He will thus not only keep his hands away from other people's pockets,
but keep the bands of other people out of his own pockets too.
What will they Do -with it?
THEY are advertising for Contracts for Supplies for the use of the
Metropolitan Police. Amongst the articles specilied is "Ship Chan
dlery. What can the Police or the Police Courts want with " Ship

A. light of wit and love to great and small,
By the dark angel he is summoned hence,
To solve the mightiest mystery of all!

Before the Judge who metes to men their dues,
Men's cheeks, through English-speaking lands, turn pale,
Far as the speaking wires can bear the news-
Blanched at this sudden snapping of a life,
That seemed of all our lives to hold a share;
So were our memories with his fancies rife,
So much of //is thought our thoughts seemed to bear.

To the judge on the bench, none read but owned
The large heart o'er which the large brain held rule,
The fancy by whose side clear sense sat throned,

The shaping faculty that breathed life's breath
In types, all felt they knew and still had known,
Life-like, except that they are safe from death.

Substance to airy nothings of the brain,
His fancies seem with men's experience blent,
Till to take each for other we are fain?
And who that ever wielded such a power
Used it so purely, to such Christian end,
Used it to quicken the millennial hour,
When rich to poor shall be as friend to friend?
Who can say how much of that love's pure leaven
That leavens now the lump of this our world,
With influence as of a present Heaven,
Like light athwart chaotic darkness hurled,
May be traced up to springs by him unsealed,
To clods by him stirred round affection's roots,
To hearts erst hard, but by his fires annealed
To softness whereof Love's works are the fruits.
Mourn, England, for another great one gone
To join the great ones who nave gone before—
And put a universal mourning on.
Where'er sea breaks on English-speaking shore.
His works survive him, and his works' work too—
Of love and kindness and good will to men,
Hate of the wrong, and reverence of the true,
And war on all that shuns truth's eagle-ken.
Earth's two chief nations mourners at his tomb:
Their memories for his monument: their love
For his reward. Such is his glorious doom,
Whom mortal praise or blame no more shall move 1

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVAKI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
UNE 9тн. Thursday.
Their Wisdoms the
Commons met after
the holidays. Their
Superior Wisdoms
(quoad hoc), the Lords,
declined to abbreviate
their recess, and re-
posed until the fol-
lowing Monday.
LORD MAHON took
his seat for East Suf-
folk, and Mr. Punch
congratulates the ac-
complished historian,
LOKD STANHOPB, up-
on his son's being
thus bound prentice
to statesmanship. We
trust that the young
nobleman will show
himself worthy of the
name so long adorned
byhisSire. Mr. Punch
was glad to see MR.
DISRAELI in his place
again, and giving no
sign, of having suf-
fered from his own ill-
health, or any corre-
spondent's ill -man-
ners.
Well, what are late hours? ME. GILFIN very properly objected to those of the
House. MR. LOWE'S idea of lateness was illustrated by his saying he could not
take certain business after one o'clock. This sounds early to young ladies who go
to balls; but the House is composed of middle-aged gentlemen of sixty or so, who,
if they go to balls, ought to be ashamed to go to constituents.
The principal debate, on the Customs and Revenue Bill, waa about "sugar"—
the article that is put into tea—not that put into the dirty bauds of dirty electors.
There was a question of draw-back, raised by Мк. CRAÜÍURD. No doubt he was
quite right; but we wish, in the interest of Materfamilias, that he would let the
matter alone, as any grocery discussion in the House makes the Grocers raise
prices, by nefarious instinct. The Government got a small beating, 49 to 45, on a
small horse-tax, which even the SI-BAKER descended from kis altitude to condemn
from the Treasury Bench.
The Yeomanry were a good deal laughed at, but £80,000 was voted for those
Braves, by 124 to 20.
Friday. MR. GREGORY said that the fares on the South-Eastern Railway were
much higher than on any other line. MR. GILPIN denied that they were excessive.
We shall take early opportunity of testing this, by tendering at the pay-place what
we think a just fare, and should the ticket be refused us, we shall impeach MR.
GILPIN, and have him sent to the Tower. Not that this will be any punishment,
for he will have the honour of visits from the gallant Constable, of whom we saw
an excellent large photograph in Bond Street yesterday, and whom we rejoiced to
behold looking as we trust he will look for many a year. Now, who bnt Mr.
Punch could have got a chivalrous compliment out of a prosaic paragraph P He
turns everything to gold, except what he makes into diamonds.
Said MR. GRAUT DUFF— The Indian Income-tax is not officially settled, but
"nothing was less probable" than that it would be disallowed. "A trifle—some
eightpenny matter," quo' Tahtaff. That is indeed the amount, but "nothing is
less probable" than that Indian income-earners will consider it a trifle.
Gambia—where's that? There is a character of that name in The Slave, and
MR. MACBEADY used to play it admirably a good many years ago. But there is
some other Gambia, for we are going to hand it over to France. As the popu-
lation consists of 39 males and 8 females, the EMPEROR does not gain a vast
accession of subjects; but we should like to know what he pays for these 47, per
head. The number is small, but whether the Government is quite justified in
selling colonists should, we think, be considered. We see in Magna Charta no
direct authorisation of the practice. But Gambia must be a good way off, so it
doesn't much matter. Sancho Panza is an authority, and his outbreak of joy at
being nominated a governor is caused by his instant recollection that he can sell
his people as slaves.
MR. CAMPBELL proposed to do away with the present system of County Govern-
ment. He looks on the provincial magnate as a Guy, and sings, from Quentin
Duricard—
"0 County Guy!
Thy hour ie nigh."
He desires Municipal Institutions in the country districts. MR. BRUCE opposed
such sweeping changes in arrangements that had been the growth of centuries,
and was victorious by 61 to 39, and we trust that this will give the Opposition—
"In future talk a fair excuse
To «peak more nobly of the Ввисв."
When pur Mint is idle (which it never would be if the
Authorities had a proper sense of things; for then, they
would be always coining five-guinea pieces to be sent in
purses to Mr. Punch and his young men, as slight testi-
monials of their perpetually saving the nation), we coin
for other Powers. MR. MUNTZ thinks that this compe-
tition with commercial persons is unfair. MR. LOWE thinks
that as we must keep up a staff of skilled workmen, we
had better let them fill up their leisure by coining for
Mint-less nations than sit idle. The raising such small
questions reminds Mr. Punch of certain persons who
minded Mint, aniseed, and so on, and neglected greater
matters of law—and law-making.
Attorney-Gene ral SIR R. COLLIER introduces a Bill
affecting advertisements for the recovery of stolen pro-
perty, the present system working objectionably. While
he is about it, Mr. Punch wishes that Sis ROBERT would
look at a good many other advertisements, and would in-
troduce a clause preventing some of the atrocious vulga-
risms with which folks seek to attract notice at any price.
We shall have such things printed upside down next, in-
deed we have seen this done in low class provincial papers.
Mr. Punch tramples beneath the deep Titanian prisons any
one who dares to say that these be small matters. It is no
small matter to be offended regularly every morning (except
Sunday) just when you are in a sweet temper from the first
rich draught of coffee a great deal too strong to please the
doctors.
PILGRIMS IN PROGRESS.
(A Canticle for the Platform.)
EPSOM, Hampton, Ascot Races,
Whitsuntide just falling, too;
Noses false on silly faces,
Tipsy thousands meet the view.
Never mind; we all are tending
To the same exalted goal;
Oh yes, everyone ascending:
Every glorious Human Soul!
All those gents with their sham noses,
Being rightly understood,
Are, though hardly one supposes,
Driving to the True and Good.
All those little shopboys, wearing
Paper streamers in their hats,
In the same direction faring;
All the betting men and flats.
They have not our placid features;
They have not our polished airs;
But they are our fellow-creatures:
We are going, all, upstairs.
Let not any facts abate your
Trust, friends, in the golden rule
Of belief in Human Nature;
Though your Brothers play the fool.
Infallible Fill.
CARDINAL ANTONELLI has replied to the remonstrances
of certain Powers on the addition about to be made to
Roman doctrine, that there is no occasion for them to be
afraid of Infallibility, as it will be merely an abstract dogma.
Precisely so; and no doubt those Powers will take very
rood care that such it shall remain. Perhaps they will
be further of opinion that the sovereignty of an infallible
Pontiff had better be purely spiritual. Then Italia farà
da ie, including Rome, Verb. tat. sap.; and if that is not
convertible witfi ГетЬ. sat. Pap., who is to blame?
Novum Organum.
IN a recent General Assembly of the Free Church of
Scotland, DR. BEGQ (capital name for a divine living on
the alms of the Free Faithful) protested against the intro-
duction of the Organ into their public worship. Rather
khan that, he would see the Anglican Surplice, or any other
innovation. If the reverend gentleman objects to music,
he should have added Anglican "bands to the other
ministerial "ornament." But surely DR. BEGO forgets
that if he has an organist in the chnrub, he is sure of extra
"voluntary" contribuí ions, and notes, too.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF
(FROM А ГАНГ ANCIENT VASB IN тн« POSSESSION OF MR. Punca.)
'TIS AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY GOOD.
TRUE of all winds: truer of none than that which, the other day,
carried the purgation of fire through a square mile of Pera. That
surely does not deserve to be called an ill wind which is certain to
blow the long-suffering Pérotes stone houses for wood, stately streets
instead of frowsy alleys, level pavements for hills and hollows of rough
stones, pure air for miasma, light for darkness, cleanliness for filth,
and health for disease. Above all, that was not an ill wind for JOHN
BULL which blew the sparks of destruction into the Palace of the
British Embassy. The wind from that quarter had hitherto only blown
JOHN every year a shower of bills for repairs, till it seemed as if the
house should have been called—not the Palace of Péra, but of Repair-a.
All housekeepers know what it means when "the builders" get into
the house. The builders were never out of JOHN BULL'S house at
Pera. Now it is burnt down, let us hope it will cease to burn a hole
in his pockets. It had cost £200,000, and was still, like Oliver Twist,
"asking for more."
A new house can't cost as much to build as the old one did to keep
standing. Punch begs leave to propose as its epitaph, "Ñon resurgam."
Variation on Macbeth.
THE HOME SECRETARY talks of bringing a measure, to check the
adulteration practised by fraudulent tradesmen, forward next Session.
Ah!
Next Session, and next Session, and next Session,
Creeps in this petty pace from month to month,
To the last syllable of late August's time;
And all our Ministries have promised Bills,
And wasted gusty breath.
ARISTOCRATIC ASPIRATION.
"I SHOULDN'T mind," said SNOBSON, "my name bein' stained hever
so. if it honly 'ad an 'andle."
SIMPLE CHARADES FOE IDLE MOMENTS.
(Hot Weather. 90° in the Shade. Too hot for guessing. Recommended
to be taken with cooling drinks.)
THE principle adopted here is that on which MR. OLLENDOBF has
founded his method of teaching languages; i. e., that every question
contains Us own answer.
ls( Charade.—My first is a Hat, my second is a Box, and my whole is
what you put a hat in. Answer. Hat-box.
This gained the third prize.
2nd Charade,—My first is a Boot. My second is a Fish, (if very hot
say "a Jack" at once), and my whole is what you pull off your boots
with. Answer. Boot-jack.
To this was awarded the second prize.
3rd Charade.—Hi? first is Night, my second is Cap. My whole is
night-cap. Answer (almost evident). Night-cap.
This gained the first prize for its charming simplicity aud pointed
wit.
Riddle.—If a pig was made out of ft guinea, what sort of a pig would
he resemble P Answer. A guinea-pig.
*** This was considered too recondite by the President of the
Lazy Club, and the proposer was fined in Wenham Lake ice.
Riddle.—"Why is a man who, when at Dover, is going to Deal, like a
gentleman at a card-table, going to deal for whist. Answer. Because
he is going to deal.
*** This obtained the second prize.
The first prize had not been given when our parcel left. No ad-
journment had been proposed up to 5 A.M. Left lounging.
THOUGHTS WITHOUT WORDS.
(Under the same conditions as above.)
Lazy Thought (on a beautiful view from a country-houie). Position is
nine points of the lawn. (N.B. Might also do for a Bishop.)
Delicious—flowers smell.
Watches are nuisances.
Exercise is not necessary to appetite.
Wish Sun wouldn't alter its position: I mean, the earth ought to be
too hot to move. Shouldn't move if I was earth.
Ought to be thankful, now, that we are not Criminal Barristers in
good practice, nor Sentinels.
Horrid idea to be in a Line regiment on active service near the
Equator. Can't think any more.

honour to the nightingale, but why should that warbler (S. Philomela
luscinia) engross all such honour f Norway is too far north for
nightingales, and a celebrated vocalist of that country had better be
styled the Norwegian Redwing, whilst we might term a popular song-
stress of our own the British Blackbird, or the English Bullfinch.

"WHOM THE CAP FITS."
Tu KUK once was an Osford Professor,
Not so often attacked as aggressor,
Whose sharp pen and sharp tongue,
Ink and scorn freely flung,
On all who displeased their possessor.
His chair was of Modern History;
His lectures were bilious and hlistery;
When he 'd served out the dead,
On the living he laid,
With as small heed of mercy as mystery.
Cantank'rous, contemptuous, and clever,
From his height he ganged human endeavour,
And enthroned o'er the throng
Showed where others were wrong,
But himself never went astray—never!
So hot hard and heavy he hit folks,
That, e'en while admiring his wit, folks
Made wry months o'er the gall,
That embittered it all,
Till bis truth, like malignity, bit folks.
But ne'er was his scalpel more busy
Than while he was cutting up DIZZT:
With hard words he bemauled him;
And bad names he called him;
And on this theme from frigid waxed fizzy.
But when sprightly Lolhair, dans son essor,
Slyly showed up an Oxford Professor—
Who talks in a »train
Self-sufficient and vain,
That would fit RHADAMANTHTJS' assessor—
In a word, when the freedoms retorting,
To which GOLDWIN was free in resorting,
Dizzr counters on SMITH,
With point, pepper, and pith,
The Professor straight sets up a snorting!
Claps on the cap DIZZY has woven—
Though to own it in no way behoven—
Shouts, "See what he 's done—
This son of a gun !—
To the midriff who ought to be cloven!
"' Social parasite!' that 's what he styles me!
'Tis lucky nought he can say riles me!
The vile wretch !—well he knows
I will pull his Jew nose,
If in my own name he defiles me!
"Mind, I 'm not the least bit in a passion—
Though I write in this rather hot fashion:
The attack has no sting,
Which, thus calm, back I fling,
And ' Coward !' hie brazen face dash on!"
If his shaft be indeed so unpointed,
And your armour so perfectly jointed,
Yon ought to have laughed
If yon sent back the shaft,
Nor your barb with such venom anointed!
Those at whom dirt is flung back will pelt it;
If it hits, look as if you ne'er smelt it:
When those bowls who play
Meet a ruh, the worst way
Is, by wincing, to show that you 're felt it.
New Book for the Season.

AN EXAMPLE TO GREECE.
Тнв Missas. BONELL (uncle and nephew) lately captured by
brigands near Gibraltar, having been released, on payment of their
ransom of £5,000, the Spanish Guardia Civile waylaid the brigand»,
killed three out of four, and recovered the ransom.
This it is to have a Government that really understands a thing!
Spain has so long robbed her creditors abroad, that she is quite equal
to robbing her brigands at honic.
Besides, she won't stand "the nntradesmanlike falsehood — the
same concern." Her Government keeps the right of robbing in ¡is
own hands—and we how it answers! The Spanish Government can
make Spanish brigands disgorge, but who can enforce disgorging ou
the Spanish Government P
Even the British Government has acquiesced in the pillage by
Spanish officers and officials of the unfortunate crew of the Tornado,
55 British sailors, who, after being robbed of chronometers, clothes,
tools, and money, to the value of £1,093, and imprisoned and ill-treated
for eighteen months besides, have been reduced to accept a paltry
compensation of £1,500 among them—LORD CLARENDON, to the eternal
disgrace of our Government, baying declined to insist on more.
There never was a case in which the British Lion has eaten more
dirt than this of the Tornado.
We are glad to see that while MB. FORBES CAMPBELL, as agent
of this ill-starred crew, is fain to accept the miserable £1,500, which
does not represent more than the actual value of the property stolen
from these British subjects—leaving them altogether uncompensated
for their ill-treatment, detention, and consequent losses—he does not,
abandon their other claims on the Spanish Government.
Few things are more striking, and sad, than the contrast between
the "tall talk" of Ьони CLARENDON apropos of the murder of three
English travellers of family by the Greek brigands, and his apathy over
the robbery, imprisonment, and ill-usage of 55 unoffending British sea-
men—none of whom bad the luck to count a nobleman or a Minister
among his connections—by the Spanish Government.
But does not this same Tornado case show—like the case of the
BONELLS—how much better the Spanish Government understands
robbery than the Greek P
The Greek Government winks at brigandage: the Spanish Govern-
ment practises it.
The Greek officials are content to share the plunder with the rob-
bers: the Spanish officials transfer it bodily from the robbers' hands to
their own.
The Greek Government gets bullied and threatened with the exaction
of compensation for losses it has not profited by: the Spanish
officials and officers are allowed to pocket their plunder, and the
English Foreign Minister refuses to endorse the complaint of their
victims.
The Spanish Guardia Civile have recovered MESSRS. BONELL'S
ransom. We have not yet heard how much of it has found its way
back to the MESSRS. BONBLLS.
We suspect the BONELLS will find that the Bone-alls—alias the
Spanish officials—have been beforehand with them. But even if the
BONELLS don't get back a farthing, one thing we should recommend
,hem not to do—that is, appeal to the Foreign Office, or they will be
jrcl.ty sure to find, as the crew of the Tornado have done, delay, impu-
iation. and insult added to injury. They will not only have to put up
with the loss of their money, but be told, in effect, if not in terms, that
11 it serves them right."
UNINTELLIGIBLE.
"Мп.тп TEKNIKE—Theophraetue—the Reddle aleo is of two kinda, the
native and the factitious—Hill. Milto of Art—Artificial Milton—Millos ol
he QreekB.—Genuine ground WHITE LEAD &c."
WILL some one have the goodness to explain the meaning of thit
mysterious advertisement with its bewildering references to THEU-
PHRASTUS and MILTON ("artificial" indeed!) and HILL, and the
.¡reeks P The mention of white lead and other common-sense articles,
md the subscription of a business-like address, preclude the idei
.hat it is the composition o'a lunatic or a Spiritualist. Our sleepiest
weazel suggests (and if right, a feat in conversational art justifie!
notice of the device) that in making us ask its meaning, it answers it:
purpose.
National Suicide.
"ITALIA felo de te" remarked MBS. MALAFROF, misquoting a well
tnown saying in reference to Italy. It is probable, though, that, i
the Italian revolutionists could have their way, Italy would, indeed
very soon do for herself.

Tom/tins (he has heard his friend Stodge talk so much about that lovely spot WobHcswidc, whither he was going sketching, that he was
induced to accompany him. A day has elapsed, and he is awaking to the horror of his sitvation .') "SEEMS то ME AN INFERN I CALL

SAVOURS OF THE EXCURSION SEASON.
RICH odour yields Syringa bloom; the blossoms of the thorn
Eihale a potent fragrance in the sunny summer morn;
Wistaria hath a choice perfume; the lily aud the rose,
As much as they rejoice the eye, do gratify the nose.
The hyacinth 's delightful; from the breathing violet
A joy comes wafted on the gale; likewise from mignonette.
Delicious is the woodbine, the sweet brier's truly sweet,
But things of scent, for my content, the best, are good to eat.
Of all the flowers in all the bowers, although I love them well,
There's none 1 deem so nice as steam from kitchen of hotel.
The turtle reek- but words are weak—mock turtle e'en will do.
And, oh! immense the grateful sense from sniff of Irish stew!
When sage and onions do roast duck, goose, sucking pig proclaim,
What rapture owns not every mau that's worthy of the name F
On whom does not an ecstasy of blissful transport seiz?,
When partridge, pheasant, turkey, with aroma load the breeze.
That flower a zest which doth suggest I call the sweetest one;
It bears its name, by common fame, from turning to the sun.
That may or not be true; no jot about that point care I;
But heliotrope recalls young hope; it smells like cherry pie.
Ли Experiment on John Bull.
THERE is every reason to believe that the Fenian invasion of Canada
was concerted by some of the more thoughtful of the Irish Americans,
in the hope that, it would induce the British Government to let their
associates, the political convicts, out of gaol.
NONE SO DEA.F AS THOSE THAT WON'T HEAR,
MONSIGNOB MARET, Bishop of Sura, one of the weightiest oppo-
nents of Papal Infallibility, is, or is said to be, very deaf. When he
was speaking against "the Dogma" the other day, he could neither
hear the calf to order, or the command to "cut it short," and " shut
np," which followed, from the indignant President of the Council.
The consequence was a scene. What with MONSIGNOR MABBT'S
disagreeable truths and unwelcome wisdom; the President's vain
attempts to silence him; the applause of Monsignor*s friends of the
minority encouraging the orator; and the majority backing up the
President. There seems to have been a regular row in the buildings."
Lay listeners in the Basilica, without the sacred precincts of the
Council, overheard "strange noises "—strange indeed for such a
scene—the majority and minority of the venerable fathers at logger-
heads, if not at fisticuffs.
Nobody seems quite sure whether MONSIGNOR MARET was quite
so deaf as he seemed, on this occasion, at least. REYNOLDS used to
declare that he often found his trumpet his best friend. He had only
to lower it to be beyond the reach of bores, fools, or critics. His
friends suspected that his deaf ear was usually on the side of the
remarks he didn't wish to hear. So we have all heard of NELSON
turning his blind eye to the signal of retreat.
But whether MARET be deaf or not, there can be no doubt who is
deaf in the Council: and that is, the majority—and their deafness is
in the ear through which wisdom cries and good counsel finds its way.
THE CRUELTY OP FIELD SPORTS.
To kill a hare with greyhounds may be a cruel practice, yet most of
us regard it as a mere matter of course.

A BUSSIAN APICTOS.
YOU know that when the pious /EXEAS, under the guidance of the Sibyl, explored the spiritual
world of ancient mythology, he found certain true Trojans and trumps m the pleasanter part
of it. Among these, you recollect, are specified bands of heroes of a class now represented by
Chelsea pensioners with wooden legs: heroes considerably better pensioned than their repre-
sentatives. Poets, too, are mentioned, such as JOHN MILTON, and also DR. WATTS; and those
who said things worthy of Punch. Elysium was the meed of deservera who had distinguished
themselves by patriotism and literary genius :—
"Inventas eut qui vitara excoluere per artes :"
JAMES WATT, for instance, as well as ISAAC WATTS, ISAAC NEWTON, HUMPHRY DAVY,
MICHAEL FABADAT, besides GALILEO and a few other illustrious foreigners. Among these last,
JÜNÍAS, being so gifted with clairvoyance as to be enabled to see the spirits of people who
had yet to be born—MABCELLUS, for one-
might possibly hare foreseen the spirit of the
inventor named in a letter from Paris, an-
nouncing that :—
"COUNT GREOOIBS KOUCIIELT.FF, one of our
immensely rich Russians, has lately died, llus-
eian millionnaires are laid to beat even English-
men in their whims and fancies. One day, our
Count gare a petit souper to a select party of eight,
and fed them, after the fashion of the old Roman
Emperors, with parrots' tongues stewed with
truffles."
For, doubtless, the conception of the dish
above-named is original. The Roman Em-
perors had their mushrooms, whereof the best
were Bö/pH, a name now given to toad-
stools, of which some only are good to eat;
but it is very questionable if either HELIO-
GABALUS or VITBLLIUS, whom we may call
WHILES for short, were ever blessed with a
truffle. We may doubt whether, in any Im-
perial menu or cibariorum tabella, there was
ever included such an entrée as Lingua:
psittatorum concoctée cum taberibus tfstivis.
Ancient epicures, indeed, are said to have
eaten nightingales' tongues now and then for
a freak, but they were probably too wise, and
eat simply the nightingale. AH the warblers
are good to eat that are big enough to be
worth cooking, cockrohin, inclusive; does

crumbs? As to a parrot, however, though
one would, in one's ignorance, as soon have
thought of eating a piece of magpie, the
tongue of it may be a nice morsel, especially
with the savoury addition of truffles. The
genius which invented this dish, rather too
expensive for mankind at large, has probably
made a variety of culinary discoveries which
are boons to his species, and within the reach
of the "general," to whom it is quite pos-
sible that parrots tongues would, even though
stewed with truffles, be as caviare. Trust we
that COUNT KUÜCHF.LKFP was a scientific
gastronomer; not a modern heathen, one of
those quorum deu» neuter est: and that he has
gone to the happy hunting-grounds, where he
sups with ST. ALEXANDER NEWSKI and
M. SOYER.
A SUBSTITUTE FOR SIMONY.
NOTHING can be more obvious than that
the sale of a Church living differs to to cash from
that of a public appointment, which is a merely
terrestrial transaction. No man of this world
can doubt that the former is as proper as the
latter is wrong; yet variety is charming, and
therefore the exceptional agency of the elective
principle in deciding ecclesiastical preferment
may perhaps be borne with. Thereon was the
REV. C. BADGER, M.A., elected, the other
day, to fill the vacant Chaplaincy of St. John's
Church, Deritend, Birmingham. Election to
this office is based on household suffrage;
which may, perhaps, be considered a method
not unsuitable to a household of faith. The
newspaper paragraph announcing this extra-
ordinary, but rather agreeable, item of cleri-
cal news, concludes with the statement, that
MB. BADGER'S views are evangelical. At
any rate, they are better than they would be
if they were mercenary. Let us nopejthose
views will not so excite the animosity of High
Church zealots that BADGE» will get baited
by them; for they .would be guilty of worse
than cruelty to animals if they drew, that
BADGEB.
A Lame Conclusion.
A MEKBEB of the Junior Swellton has
likened the Reform Club to the Orthopœdic
Hospital, on the ground that it is chiefly
open to reform club feet.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ONDAY, June 13. The hot
weather showed that even
the Lords, who sit aloft
like the gods of Epicurus,
and smile upon the doings
of the inferior creation, are
subject—if not to logical
—to meteorological influ-
encings. The House was
to have been a sort of
Conciliation Hall, for the
LOR» CHANCELLOR had
altered his Judicature Bill,
in the hope of pleasing
LOED CAIRNS. That Lord
was appeased, and with-
drew his motion against
the Bill. But LORD GEAN-
VILLE could not help de-
fending a remark he had
m&de the other night to the
effect that "the Law Lords
loved to pick one another's
work to piece«." Also, he mentioned that law reforms were the salt
of their Lordships' assembly. Whereat LOUD CAIRNS (peppered) told
him that he was "irregular." LORD GRANVILLE retorted that LOBD
CAIRNS was "very irregular" in saying so. LORD CAIRNS said that
LORD GBANVibLE was "grossly irregular" in referring to a former
speech. We like oratorical fence, but it seems to us that there wee a
poverty of invention in these invectives. They slightly remind Mr.
Pvtck of the sailor's explanation of a "repartee." "Why, BILL, I
can't tell you exaotually what it is, but I'll give you a specimen.
'JACK,' says you to me, 'you're a fool.'" "Yes, JACK, afl right."
"'Впл,' says I to yon, 'you're a thundering fool.' That s a
repartee, BILL." But we expect celestial sarcasms to be more varied
and sparkling. However, the weather excused everything.
In the Lords, as may be known by some, the House, and not an
individual (if our friend Ma. DENISON will excuse us for calling him so)
decides what speaker shall proceed, if more than one arises. LORD
SALISBURY desires that the CHANCELLOR, as the Chairman, shall call
on the Peer to hold forth. He says that the disturbances under the
existing system recaí the days of the O. P. riots. Did he—could he—
mean that one set calls for "Old Peer," and the other for " New Peer " Г
Also, he said that a Peer with a long name, not easily shouted, had a
bad chance. LORD GRANVILLE said that he had not observed any par-
ticular shyness about new Peers, and that they got very fair play.
LORD HATHEBLEY utterly declined to be arbiter. The SPEAKER in the
Commons had learned his business; a Chancellor was generally a new
Lord, and knew nothing of the rules. So the motion was withdrawn.
In the Commons the important fact was made known that the
quantity of ink annually bought for the public service is 79,616
gallons, liquid, and 169,392, powder, and the price is £3,212 Ov. ud.
It was probably more in EARL RUSSELL'S days, as he was fond of
writing letters. But why MB. CRAWFORD wanted these inky statistics
Mr. Punch cannot imagine, and is not going to try, with the ther-
mometer at 80*.
The PREMIEB was kind enough to say that he would indulge the
Ноше with morning sittings, that the Education Bill might be more
comfortably discussed. Mr. Punch has sometimes been profane enough
to rejoice that he is not a Member of Parliament. That universal joy
can hardly be said to be diminished by MB. GLADSTONE'S kindly
announcement.
MB. OTWAT spoke of the great fire at Constantinople—to think
Mr. Pvnek should have spelled and written that long word, when
Pera would have done as well, or better, seeing that it would have
been accurate. The ground floor of our Embassy is not injured much,
above that there is nothing left but walls. The ambassador has lost
his clothes, but has saved Eis archives. Mr. Punch has not the least
idea what these are, or how the word is pronounced.
Then came Committee on the University Tests BUL Aged MB.
HADPIELD graciously observed that eminent Dissenters onglit to be
allowed to compete with "old rotten professors of theology." Can
these dry bones live? There was much quarrel, and a Conservative
took credit to the Opposition for having prevented the Government
from being overwhelmed by the advanced reformers. MR. HENLEY
voted wrong, being hard of hearing. It is a misfortune when we
don't hear him. MR. MOWBRAY hinted that the bill had by no means
become law, a projection of himself into futurity which might as well
have been spared. It was a sort of "Wait till my Big Brother comes."
A code of Merchant Shipping Law is wanted most particularly.
Also, it has been prepared. But when Mr. Punch mentions that here
is nearly the end of June, and that the code contains 700 clauses .
However, it was "read" a Second Time—that ¡л, it was taken as
read, and Committee appointed. Mr. Punch is carefully studying all
the accounts of the cruise of the Channel Fleet, abo of the Sappho
and Cambria matches, that he may be perfectly up in the subject.
Tuesday. The Lay Lords attended in force, but there were few Bishops
and fewer ladies. The Second Reading of the Irish Land BUI was the
business of the night. Which process LORD GRANVILLB, in a very
able speech, did recommend to their Lordships. The Пики OF RICH-
MOND, leader of the Opposition, approved of some of the clauses, and
strongly disapproved of others, and he means to introduce a variety of
what he considers amendments. Mr. Punch knows perfectly well that
as an accomplished cook can take a piece of simple meat, simplex mun-
diliis (plain cookery in its neatness), and so sauce it that the most Ыаге
of diners-out will nod lofty approbation. He can take this Irish debate
and stick into it more sparkling gems than garnish all the coronets of
those who made it. But what has the House of Lords done for him
that he should do so much for the House of Lords'? Let the Peers
talk their own pearls and diamonds, and he will enact Mr. Ruby
(l,i ¡t !i и if), and set them in the most artistic fashion. However, he com-
pliments the venerable EARL RUSSBLL (always Mr. Punch't admiration,
though, as lago saitli. "it hath not appeared " — always,) upon a
vigorous and telling speech, in which it is needless to say those esteemed
noblemen, LORD BUBLBIGH and LORD SOMERS were heard of, and in
which the veteran statesman "looked forward with sanguine hope"
for good results of our irían policy. He is a brave and a great man
who, being also a wise man, is sanguine at SO.
LORD ÜRAN MORE moved the rejection of the Bill, but as he was not
to be supported by his party, his procedure commanded no particular
attention, and his eloquence did not supply what was wanting
in political significance. LORD SALISBURY said that the Bill was
black, white, and grey, on which a lady in the gallery playfully
remarked—
"K«ad it round three times, and get it out of the way."
levity which we can hardly approve in a member of the sex which is
about to take the control of all things sublunary. Adjourned.
MB. BUITON was heard on the Revision of the Bible. He does not
like this to be in the hands of Convocation, and he thinks that the
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES onght to be asked to co-operate in
work interesting to English-speaking men. MB. GLADSTONE explained
that this latter arrangement would contravene the American Constitu-
tion. In regard to the work which the "Companies" appointed by
Convocation is to do, it Ц to.be tentative; that is, Government will wait
and see whether it is satisfactorily executed, and whether it is generally
accepted by the people. In that case, and at a distant time, it may be
the duty of the Executive. to proceed to Authorisation, but no legis-
lative recognition of the proceeding is to be sought for at present.
Wednesday, MR. MABDCASTLK proposed to do away with the Mi-
nority Clauses of the last lieform Acts. MB, GLADSTONE supported
the abolition, and. after a debate, there was division, and a tie"—
181 to 181. Legislative wisdom being thus in two scales holding equal
weights, the SPEAKER'S casting vote was asked. He hinted at possible
changes of opinion, and commanded another division—with the usual
technicality—and the Bill for abolishing the Minority Clauses was itself
abolished by 1S3 to 175—legislative wisdom having, possibly, been
affected by atmospheric changes, or some other wonderful influence.
Thunday. Irish Land bill again in the Upper Chamber. LOBD
CAIRNS made a lone speech against it, and denied that the Irish
required exceptional legislation. Instead of pitching into his Lordship,
Mr. Punch remarks that he caimul »ее why a iiation that can produce
an exceptional legislator (that is, not one who takes exceptions to
everything, but) an eloquent, shrewd, and caustic debater like LORD
CAIRNS, should not have exceptional legislature. The slight sophism
shall be excused for the sake of the elegant compliment. LOBD HALI-
FAX fought for the measure with no wooden sword, and EARL GREY, as
far as people could understand, seemed inclined to think that
though a better Bill might have been made, this one might do. LOBD
ATHLUMNEY, of course, stood athletically by it. Sagacious LOBD DERBY
said that if the Bill would do what it was said to be intended to do,
namely, encourage small tenancies, he would have opposed it, but lie
thought that it would work the other way. But he urged that this
measure ought to be final, and that nothing more ought to be conceded
to agitation. We should have no gratitude for the measure, nor any
reward, except the conviction that we had done all we could to set
Ireland straight. DUKES ARGYLL and ABERCORN spoke; the former,
of course, for the Bill, the latter not opposing it very strongly, ami
owning mat a comprehensive land bill for Ireland was necessary.
But we expect " handsomeness" in a HAMILTON. Adjourned again.
Poor MR. EDMUNDS, of "the Scandal," has been Quodded, Shopped,
Nabbed. These beautiful synonyms for being custardised, or taken
into captivity, may be lost now that the system which produced them
has been nearly done away, so Mr. Punch places them in his Museum.
MR. EDMUNDS is "in," as a Crown debtor, for £7,904, so there is
nothing discreditable in his captivity. The sum is nearly a "round"
one, and gentlemanly. MB. GLADSTONE deprecated discussion on the
subject, as a Judge had been applied to by MB. EDMUNDS.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Then Began—when will it Finish?—the Education Bill Debate.
MB. GLADSTONE moved the House into Committee, and mentioned the
Amendments which Government proposed to make in the BUL They
are considerable.
But education shall not be made merely Secular.
The Local Boards may exclude Religious Teaching from the Schools
that shall be founded upon Kates.
They may not introduce any religious feature, except the reading and
expounding of The Book. No Catechisms.
The Schools which are partly supported by Voluntary Contributions,
partly by public grants, snail have none of the local rates, and they
must take to the Time Table Conscience Clause.
Now the Conservatives had, at a meeting, agreed to support the Bill.
But MB. DISBAELI to-night proclaimed that the Bill was virtually a new
one. He was very severe upon the reticence which had kept back the
intentions of Government, and he described the conduct of Government
as unparalleled, in thus, after four months, suddenly altering a measure
just as it was to go into Committee. Yet he did not oppose. He muet
have time to consider the new structure. MB. V KBNON HARCOUHT,
who is determinately secular, also wanted time, for Government had
gone so far in the direction he desired that he could only complain that
they had not gone farther. Nor would MB. DIXON, for the Birming-
ham Seculars, give judgment; and so Ц was settled that nothing should
be done until the following Monday. Mr. Punch points out, in hie
usual superior fashion, that the preternatural cleverness supposed to
be inherent in Members of Parliament was not marvellously illustrated
on this occasion. The whole subject has been betöre them, as MB.
DISBAELI justly remarked, for months, and yet they cannot see the
bearings of a few simple propositions laid before them by MR. GLAD-
STONE, who is a master in the art of stating things clearly, far be it
from Mr. Punch to disparage the House's intellect, however—he wor-
ships it with abject veneration; and concludes that, like the Spectator
(ADDISON'S), when it is apparently dull, it U with some deep design.
MB. LOWE, on a little Budget debate, was sportive, and said that the
case of a day and night occupancy by différée t persone was precisely
the case of Box and Cox. It would have enlivened toe proceedings
had he favoured the House with one of MB. Аатниа SULLIVAN'S
capital songs.
N.B. Thunder-storm and heavy rain to-night, after weeks of drought.
The change was delightful to everybody, except those who had to return
home from suburban parties, as the cabmen were quite equal to the
occasion, and as they could behave as they liked with perfect impunity
—when one is in evening dress, there is no taking numbers, now effaced
from the inside of the vehicle.
Friday. The Lords polished off the Second Reading of the Irish
Land Bill. A number of Hibernian 11 aristocrats spoke, and the LORD
CHANCELLOR (who works very hard, it is said) finished with an able
reply, including a suggestion for a grim Cartoon, of a certain Irish
landlord giving his surplus tenants money for pulling down their own
cottages, and thus leaving themselves choice only between Starvation
and the States. His Lordship will be welcome at Mr. Punch's Council
Banquet. The Bill was read a Second Time.
MB. AYBTON declined to decide whether all the Turners in the
National Gallery were worthy of it. The question was evidently put to
"draw" him ; and, though not his most fervent admirer, Mr. Punch is
glad that he would not be drawn.
Estimates. Then a very thoughtful speech by MB. TOBBENS on Pau-
perism—he said that the Devil was looking over the wall at us, while we
neglected this great question. MB. (¡OSOIIKN in reply painted with
rather roseate colour. At the end great fun—Eleven divisions on the
question of adjournment, and so we ended the Ascot week.
Sage Advice for the Season.
Л Y, years do bring the philosophic mind,
WOBDSWOBTH is right. As men in life advance,
They smile, or sigh, to think that, having dined,
Young fellows can be fools enough to dance.
Who underneath the table keeps his feet.
His stomach's load sits lightly on its throne;
Eat capers, but cut none, frieiid. after meat,
Disturb bis meala who will; digest your own.
London Anatomy,
THE Metropolitan Railway will now take country visitors into the
very "heart of London." Not mnch to be gained by that, even if it
exists. At all events, so many things have run right through the Heart
of London ere now, that it ought to be pretty considerably like a Dead
Heart by this time.
How то ENJOT л WICB EM-BRACING DAT AT THE SEASIDE.—Get

THE GRAVE OF CHARLES DICKENS.
HE sleeps as he should sleep—among the great
In the old Abbey: sleeps amid the few
Of England's famous thousands whose high state
Is to lie with her monarchs—monarchs too.
Monarchs, who men's minds 'neath their sway could bring
By might of wit and humour, wisdom, lore,
Music of spoken line or sounded string,
Or Art that lives when artists are no more.
His grave is in this heart of England's heart,
This shrine within her shrine: and all around
Is no name but in Letters or in Art
Sounds as the names of the immortal sound.
Of some, the ashes lie beside his dust,
Of some, but marble forms and names are here:
But grave or cenotaph—remain« or bust—
They will find place for thee, their latest peer.*
Make room, oh tuneful HANDKL, at thy feet;
Make room, ob witty SuKUIDAX, at thy head;
Shift, JOHNSON, till tuou leave him grave-space meet;
GAURICK, whose art lie loved, press to him dead.
MACAI.T.AÏ, many-siiled mind, receive
Ну thiue, the frame that housed a mind as keen
To take an impress, or an impress leave,
From things, or on things, read or heard, or seen.
Welcome, oh ADDISON, with calm, wise face,
His fioming, who has peopled English air
Wil-li types of humour, tenderness, and grace,
Thau which thine own are lees rich and more rare.
Thou, too, his brother of our time, last lost,
THACKERAT, bend thy brow with kindly cheer
On him, thy comrade, wave-worn, tempest-tost,
Who, from life's voyage, comes to harbour here.
All the more welcome that he seeks his rest
Without the pomps that follow great ones' ends—
No mourners save the natural ones that prest
About the father's coffin or the friend's;
No sable train with plume, and plate, and pall;
No long parade of undertaker's woe;
Scarfed mutes, and feathered hearse, and coursers tall—
All that bemocks the grave with hollow show.
Humbly they brought him in the summer morn,
Humbly and hopefully they laid him down.
And on the plate that tells when dead, when born,
His children's love, like England's, lays a crown.t
* "The coffin was of plain but solid oak, and it bore the simple inscrip-
tion :•—' CHARLES DICKENS, born February 7, 1812: died, June 9, 1870.'
Hie grave, which is only between fire and six feet deep, is situated about
a yard, or a yard and a half, from the southern wall of Poet's Corner;
the spot was selected by the Dean from among the few vacant spaces in that
transept ; and our readers will hear with interest that all of CHARLES DICKBNS
that is mortal lies at the feet of HANDEL and at the head of SHERIDAN, with
KicHAim CUMBERLAND renting on his right hand and MACAULAY on his left.
His grave is near the foot of ADDISON'B statue; and THACKERAY'S bust looks
calmly down upon the grave of his old friend; DR. JOHNSON and ОА&ШСК
lie within a few yards of him; and the busts of S л А к s I-E.VKE, MILTON, and a
host of other worthies, each of them the glory of English literature in their
day, are but a little further off."—Times, Tuesday, June ША.
t Upon the coffin was a crown of green leaves and white roses. Many of
those who came to look into the grave during the day it remained upen
threw flowers into it.

AN old gentleman of seventy was going to be married to a girl of
seventeen. One day a friend surprised him, tenderly embracing his

heads on young shoulders."
The marriage was broken off.

(As Sung by the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and a Chorus of Anglican
- Dignitaries.)
Oh, if the rich Marquis had really made sail
From the pound of the Pope to the Protestant pale !
Had a CORISANDE charmed him to throw in his lot
With the Church of the Briton-not Kirk of the Scot!-
Had he seen through a CATESBY;-in GRANDISON's hat
Detected the taint of the Romanist rat,
And learnt to smell out, 'neath its scarlet ingrain,
Less of Sanctity's odour than odour of Gain-
How we all had thrown up shovel-hats in the air,
And sung hey for the Church, and long life to Lothair !
It may be, the Church angel, who guided the pen
Of that pillar of Anglican principles, BEN,
Hath not yet stirred the Marquis by logic 'or love
Lothairian, Voltairian, Mazzinian- to move
From the darkness of Rome to that region of light,
Where SHAPTESBURY, PUSEY, and JOWETT show fight,
If we trust what his own Monsignore affirms—
Call him CAPEL or CATESBY-in positive terms:
But though you take care, Monsignore so glib,
Not to write what amounts to an absolute fib,
“ Suppressio veri” so freely you use,
So fully “Suggestio falsi" excuse,
Your denial does not quite conclude the affair, -
We'll still hope in the blessed effects of Lothair !
We'll still pray for the time when “the Marquis” shall come
With his eyesight released from the blinkers of Rome, .
Not back to the cold Calvinistical pale,
Whence he made his escape, as a prisoner from jail,
But to us, who the one Via media have found,
That 'twixt Rome and Geneva can quarter the ground:
To us, that seem Roman in Calvinist view,
But whom Rome proclaims Luth'ran and Calvinist too,-
To us, who stand just where the half-way house ought,
'Twixt th'extreme he has left, and th'extreme he has sought,-
To the Anglican pale may our marquis repair,
By the light of the Church, and the lead of Lothair.
Save in her, in what church upon earth will be find
Room for change of belief, when to change he's inclined P
On her Ritualist side he with Pusey may roam,
And fancy himself 'mong the seven hills at home.
If at vestments and vigils he'd turn up his nose,
He can take in the Record, and sit under CLOSE,
And fancy himself, hearing his Gospel truth,
Once more in the Calvinist Kirk of his youth;
So, without changing cage, he may daily change perch,
Hop from Church into Kirk, and from Kirk into Church,
Can be Romanist, Calvinist, just as he will,
Yet be Anglican, -true Church-of-Englander, still !
Then come to the Church that all churches doth share,
And bless the white hour that you first read Lothair!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GETTING BUTTER OUT OF A DOG'S MOUTH.

S we prophesied last week,— the Guardia Civile only found on the
brigands they killed £700 ont of the £5000 ransom paid by the
MESSRS. BON EI.L. What has become of the reat of the money F
Ask the Spanish Government.
The Times draws a comparison between the comedy of Gibraltar
and the recent tragedy in Greece. "Where," it asks, "is the keystone of the
difference between the cases f" It admits that much credit is due to the tact and
energy of MR. LAYARD, bat the essential distinction is in "the promptitude of the
Spanish Government."
"In Cirucce, and especially in the Qreek Foreign Office, we found nothing but vacillation
at a period of the negotiations when firmness vu required, and nothing but obstinacy when
a temporising and conciliatory policy should have been | pursued. In Spain it was quite
otherwise. The brigands were tracked and watched from a distance.
were every one of thum observed and known, without their being aware o e act. ey
were encouraged by negotiation to demand and even to grasp the ransom which they had
agreed to take. Until they had clutched the treasure in the
streets of Cadiz, and were well on their way back to their haunts
with their money in their bags, no sign of force was made. Then,
in a moment retribution feu on the guilty band, and they were
nearly ill slain, while a portion of the price of their villainy was
recovered,"
"A portion?" Yes, £7UO, out of £5000. Again we ask,
where is the rest of the money F
It seems that 8m RICHARD AIRET advanced the amount
to MR. BoNELb Senior out of the military chest at
Gibraltar.
Let us hope, when our Gorernment tries to cet the money
back from the Spanish it won't find its claim "an airy
nothing." Possibly the BOVBLLS may be made to pay up.
But the least probable solution, of all probable solutions,
we will answer for it, is the one suggested the Time» .—
"We imagine that Sm RICHARD AIREY will demand the re-
payment of his loan from uo. k*ïAbu, and that Mu, LAÏAUU
will not be slow in recovering it from the Foreign Office at
Madrid."
Punch has the greatest respect for MR. L AT ARD, and a
large faith in hit power of dealing with uncivilised Govern-
ments, but we fear, it will be beyond even MB. LAYARD'S
power, to make a Spanish Government stump up to the
tnne of £5000—witness the Tornado case. A Spanish Gov-
ernment can bully—can bluster—can lie—can cheat, with
or without forms of law—above all, it can rob—even its
own robbers. But one thing it won't do—whether it can
or no—aud that is pay Us debts, above all to Englishmen.
It acts upon, whether or not it avows, the patriotic reason,
that it can't bear handing over "the Spanish" to English
hands.
ASTRONOMERS are the Sun's "good-natured friends.1'
They are never tired of talking about him, and pointing
out his black spots.
THE FARM AND THE SCHOOL.
(HAWMNCH tingt.)
EES, wonderful weather we 've had as you zay,
All right for your pleasure, but what for our hay?
The best as could be for your yacht and your train;
Our crops be parched up droo this here want o' rain.
Wuss weather'.for farmun there hardly could be,
The spacies of farmun that's practus'd by we,
We farmers as lives by the land and the plough,
In fine languidge called agriculturists now.
There 's farmun and farmun; some farmers there 's, too,
That farms other things besides acres, ah, who?
Them farmers is females and no country clowns;
They farms little babies in slums o' big towns.
They pinches the most they can out o' their keep,
Till want, rags, and filth kills 'urn off like zick sheep;
They ought to be hanged draad and quartered, no doubt,
And them childern's parants still.wnsser sarved out.
But we British farmers med truly declare
Poor childern we never sees used like that there:
Nor, what 's just as bad, if not wuss, by right nil«,
Doan't starve their young minds by denyun 'urn school.
And now I can't tell 'ее how thankful I feels
O' this here new Bill for to gie their minds meals,
And hender farm lab'rera, as every one knows,
From farmun their young 'uns to scare away crows.
This here pocket into I'll put this here hand,

SLEEP-DRIVING.
Two poor diables of Essex carters were fined, the other day, for being
asleep on their carts on the Bow Road.
The defence of the unhappy drivers deserves attention. It seems
these men have no regular hours for sleep allowed them by their
masters. In the day they work in the market-garden, or on the farm:
at night they have to drive their carts up to London with the produce,
and back. The only sleep they get, according to their own account,
from Monday morning to Sunday night, is in the litter of the stable,
or atop of the loads in their carts, or the manure they carry back in
them.
How comes it that men submit to such conditions F Are the Essex
clodhoppers really so much duller than their neighbours, as to give two
days' work for one day's wages P Or, are the relations of labour and
capital so distorted, that the master can really, in this case as in that
of the London bakers, impose any hours and conditions of toil he
pleases, on the poor wretches whom he employs F
The case is worth looking into. We recommend it to MR. TRE-
tiKNHEKRE, who is always inquiring and making blue-books about
somebody or something or other that is out of joint.
Sleep-walking only harms the somnambulist. But sleep-driving is
apt to endanger the lives and limbs of passengers. We can't have the
population of Bow run over; but it seems hard to lay the carters of
¡sex under hours of labour which make it impossible for them to
keep their eyes open. We recommend the East-End Magistrates, if
the law allows them, to let off the men, and to bleed, instead, those
Essex calves, their masters.
Mrs. Bamsbotham on Laws.
A GENTLEMAN of republican tendencies observed to MRS. RAMS-
ВОТПАМ that in England there was one law for the rich and another
for the poor.
"Of course there is," returned MRS. RAMSBOTHAM, who has been
lately reading history, "there 's the Poor Law, and the Sumptuary
Law; and quite right too."

"Aurora was in high spirits, amusing herself with a

"' What are you doing, child P" asked deorum pater,
good-hnmouredly. He was always 'good-humoured when
in his dressing-gown and slippers; he had just soaked a

"Spinning the top of the morning,' answered the god-

brought away with her the slightest brogue in the world.

ZOOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY.
LEARNED MR._ PUNCH,
As a social philosopher I am much struck by this description
of a'pair of foreign birds, lately added to.the charming Gardens of the
Zoological Society :—
"The male ha« a strong, «hört, curved beak i the female, a much longer
bill. The naturalista tell us that the male breaks open the bark of the tree,
within which lie« hid the grub on which they feed; and the female pulla out
the worm and present« her mate with half the meal."
In watching featherless bipeds, I have noticed some with habits hardly
differing from those ascribed to these two birds. Little ducks have,
to my knowledge, been found with a much longer bill (for articles of
finery) than that which has been given to their gander of a husband;
and, thçugh a little duck of the kind may daily share her grub with
him, it u first of all on the effort of the male that she depends for her
rapport. I would recommend your scientific readers to pursue the
analogy by paying an early visit to this interesting couple. I believe it
will be found to be considerably more interesting than many interesting
couple, they may elsewhere meet. yours obediently,
The Rookery, Tuesday. OBADIAH CROVSTOOT.

Query. What sort of fish is a NodP
Note. A Nod is a sea-fish, and is, probably, of the limpet tribe. This
we gather from our knowledge of the Periwinkle, known in polite
circles as the 'Wink. The value of the Nod has come down to us in
the form of an old proverb, "A Nod is as good as a 'Wink." and this
no doubt originated the query to which we have satisfactorily replied.

Two Templars were starting for the Continent. "tGramercy." quoth
the elder to the younger. "thy trunk is open, the string hath broke."
"By my hilts!" cried the younger, in no sort discouraged, "'tis

"Beshrew me I" answered the elder, archly," " 'twould be better
