TT was fur into the night of the Shortest Day of the disturbed, disastrous, and dismal year, 1870.
But Mr. Pukch, the Philosopher, was not meditating on disturbance, disaster, or dismaluess. lie sat pondering
on Eclipses, with the assistance of Mr. Norman Lockyer's Elementary Lesson-book, and he had nearly persuaded himself
that he partly understood something of the theory of those Phenomenr.
"The longest time an Eclipse of the Sun can be total at any place is seven minutes," he read, and he seemed
to derive comfort from that knowledge. "There has been no total eclipse of the suu in London since 1715," ho went
ou. "Let 'a see, that was the year in which the Northern Lights vainly tried to eclipse the Star of Brunswick."
A card was brought in unto him, inscribed
Jdonsieur Helios.
Jdademoiselle Selene.
"I do not know them; probably some balloon-refugees from Paris. They aro welcome Show them in."
His visitors entered. For a second, he was conscious of a blaze of golden glory, which was succeeded by a. silvery
effulgence, and then the new arrivals ceased to be more brilliant than other people of the world.
"Delighted," said Mr. Punch, whose imperturbability is proof against Gods and Men. "How aro you, Queen and
Huntress chaste and fair? And how are you, my far-darter, Lord of the Unerring Bow?"
Olympian laughter rang musically, and then Diana said, with the smile that made Endymion's dream a Paradiso
"We have a little performance for the Astronomers to-morrow, and we thought that you might like a Private View."
"Thanks very much," said Mr. Pdnch, playfully adopting the affectation of the hour. "But you will have to put
the performance off. A vessel, laden with Science, has come to grief. I believe she is called—excuse my naming her,"
ho added, with a sly glance at the lady.
"You may name her, Sir," said Diana, laughing, and tossing her radiant head. Psyche was nothing to me."
"Lemprikre"
"O, if you '11 believe Lemprif.re, you '11 believe anything," said Diana.
"I don't believe anything," replied Mr. Punch. "But may I offer you terrestrial hospitality? I fear that I
am out of nectar and ambrosir."

"Has not Mr. D'Ixion told you that we consign such old-fashioned stuff to the sideboard?" said Apollo.
"There are some stupid old deities, uncle Neptune for one, who believe in them, as old fogies on earth see luck in
mince-pies. I '11 have brandy-and-seltzer, and Miss Di will, I dare say, take some maraschino and a cigarette."
"As Byron says, ' There was a light cloud on the Moon,'" said Mr. Punch, handing her a paper of exquisite
}>apiroases Turc fort, the gift of the Eussiau Ambassador, and marked "Moscou."
"This is the way I am going to put him out to-morrow," said the Goddess, interposing her fair, round face
between her brother's and the Philosopher's. "You '11 be thirty years older, dear clever boy, before I do it again."
"1 daresay it's all right, and all very clever," said Mr. Punch, "but I want a bit of astrology, not astronomy,
from you. liaise your voces stellarum, aud tell me what's going to happen in this Sublunary Wale."
"Do you mean to say," said Diana, reproachfully, "that, with a grand Eclipse to behold, you care about
Emperors of Germany, Balloon-Ministers, battles and sieges, broken treaties, and rubbish of that kind? Who will be
thinking about them when the next Eolipse happens ? 1
"Goddess excellently bright," 6aid Mh. Punch, with that exquisite tact which combines a compliment with a
repartee, " it is a good while since that fira occurred at a certain lady*s house at Ephesus, and yet we talk of it still."
"Don't talk about that," said Diana. "Do you know that the priests who incited that poor mad Erostratus
to burn my temple, cheated him out of his share of the assurance money?"
"Their Pieverences made a good thing out of that Dis-establishment, eh? It does them credit. But now,

Jupiter about, and does the violeut Mahs run retrograde?"
"Tell him something," said Apollo, finishing his B. & S.
"Listen!" said Diana. And leaning down, as erst she leant over her sleeping Shepherd, she whispered.
But what the Moon said to Punch is laid away in the golden casket of his Memory, and locked with the
diamond key of his Fidelity. It may bo revealed, however, in duo soason.

POLITICAL SUMMARY.
RESUMING our notice of the progress of tho Government
1 Education Bill, one of the two great measures of tho
Session, wo find that after encountering some further ob-
struction in the House of Commons—one amendment, for
examplo, giving rise to a debate which, extended over four
nights—it was read a third time, and passed the House of
Commons on the 22nd of July, the'' obstructives "no longer
blocking the children's way to school. (See Cartoon, p. 5.)
The Bill went through, tho House of Lords with very little
alteration; and the Royal Speech, which brought another
"arduous " Session to a close on the 10th of August, acknow-
ledged the valuo of the legislative labours that had produced
this and tho Irish Land Act.
The death of the Earl of Clarendon at the end of Juno
occasioned some changes in the Ministry. Earl Gran-
ville succeeded Lord Clarendon at the Foreign Office,
the Earl of Kimrerley became Colonial Secretary, and
Viscount Halifax (formerly Sir Charles Wood), joined
the Government as Lord Privy Seal. Mr. Forster's un-
speakably valuable services in the conduct of the Education
Bill were recognised by his introduction into the Cabinet.
Tho day Lord Grantiile commenced his duties as
Foreign Secretary, he was told by the Permanent Under
Secretary of State, that "in all his experience he had
never known so great a lull in foreign affairs." It was the
lull before the storm—before the outburst of the terrible
war between France and Prussia, whose origin cannot be
hotter told than in the words of tho Annual Register:—
"In the bcrfnnlug of July an announcement was made by tho Spanish
Ministers of their intention to recommend Princk Leopold or HonKN7nT.-
LKRN-8lGMARtN0EX, a German Prince belonging to a branch of the House
widely separated from that which reigned in Prussia, for the loiig-vticant
throne of Spain Still, no doubt tho Kino or Prussia was his cltnf c/c
fatuiUe, and tho circumstance served as the ground of a quarrel which just
then, for political and dynastic reasons, the govorning party in France fouud
it convenient to tako up. Ever since tho German War of IsCii, France, It
was well known, had existed in mortal jealousy of Prussian aggrandise-
ment. Pretext and opportunity fitting, war with so formidable a rival
in the leadership of continental Europe, would havo been welcome any
timo within the last four years to a considerable section of the French
public: add to this tho Emperor's personal fear for his dynasty, aftcr tho
late plebiscitum had revealed a certain amount of disaffection in his army
to tho Imperial rule ; and it seemed as desirable as it was not difficult to light
the flame of public excitement with suggestions of Hismarckian intrigue*,
and of design on the part of tho Prussian Monarch to plant a subservient
relative on the southern frontier of France."
Franco complained to Prussia of Prince Leopold's can-
didature, and was told that it was no affair of tho Prussian
Government, and that no explanation could bo given. The
Due de Gramont, the French Minister for Foreign
Affnirs, a Statesman of Anti-Prussian tendencies, de-
livered a warlike speech in the Chamber; and M. Bene-
detti, the French Ambassador to the North-German
Confederation, " made application to tho King of Prussia
in person, to request him to forbid Prince Leopold's
acceptance of the Spanish Crown, but without success.
Beyond giving his personal sanction as head of the Hohen-
zollern family, the King said he had had no hand in the can-
didature, and he declined to interfere for its withdrawal.
Meanwhile, in view of the dangers to the peace of Europo
which were arising, Prince Leopold himself decided on
giving in his resignation; and a momentary hope arose
that the threatened storm had blown over. But enough had
not been done to content Gramont and the war party in
France." (Annual Register.) Tho King OF PRUSSIA was
required himself to write to tho Emperor Napoleon a
"humiliating" letter on the Prince Leopold question;
and M. Benedetti accosted tho King to this purpose
while ho was walking in tho public gardens at Ems. "His
abrupt demand was said to have been answored with a curt
denial, and he was rofusod any further interviow."

INTRODUCTION.
upon the principal events of the war, which the English
Government did its best to prevent. It was formally
declared by France on tho 19th of July; but there was no
serious engagement till the following month. Tho Emperor
Napoleon proceeded to Metz to take tho command of tho
French army; and the Kino of Prussia established his
head-quartor3 near Mayencc. When the two nations came
into conflii t, victory was almost always on the side of tho
Germans—for Bavaria, Saxony, Wiirtemburg, Baden, and
Hesse wero united with Prussia—but both sides displayed
great valour, and sustained frightful losses. Tho great
battles of Weissenburg, Worth, and Forbach, all gained
by Germany, obliged the French arm}' to retreat upon tho
lines of tho Moselle. Paris, which had been buoyed up
by falso reports of French successes, was filled with dis-
appointment and rage when the true and bad nows could
no longer be concealed. A new Ministry was formed,
Marshal Bazaine was ordered to supersede Marshal
Ledcsuf in tho supremo conduct of the war, and tho city
was placed in a state of siege.
On tho 11th of August tho King of Prussia crossed the
French frontier, and issued a proclamation to the French
people, in which ho assured them that ho was "waging
war against soldiers, not against French citizens." The
French continued to retreat towards the Moselle; and on
tho Hth, a sharp engagement took placo near Courcolles,
tho issue of which was that the Germans remained on the
field, and the French retired into Metz—tho Emperor
leaving that placo and going to Chalons, tho town which held
tho Army of Reserve under Marshal Canrorert, and
where it was expected that a great battle would bo fought,
to bar tho further progress of tho Germans towards Paris.
But tho French camp at Chalons was broken up; and
on the 1st of September, hardly a month since tho first
serious contest of the campaign, tho protracted and decisive
battle of Sedan (a fortified town in the department of tho
Ardennes, on the right bank of tho Mouse), was fought,
which ended in tho defeat and capitulation of tho French
army under MacMaiion. Then followed tho porsonal sur-
render of tho Emperor Nafoleon, who was found to be
with MacMahon's army; tho interview between Napoleon
and Bismarck, in a garden in front of a weaver's cottago;
and later in the same day, after the capitulation had been
signed, the memorable meeting between the Empekok and
tho Kino of Prussia at the Chateau of Bollovue, a fow
miles out of Sedan. The Chateau of Wilholmshohe, near
Cassel, was assigned to the Emperor as a residenco by the
King; and to this retreat Napoleon forthwith betook
himself. At the same tiino that tho battle of Sodan was
fought, Bazaine made an unsuccessful sortie from Metz:
tho siege of Strasburg, Phalsbourg, and other fortresses,
was also carried on by the Germans.
The full of Sedan was the downfull of the Empire, and
tho establishment of tho Republic at Paris. A Govern-
ment of National Defence was formed, of which General
Trociiu was President, aud Jules Favre and Gamretta
tho leading members. Tho EMPRESS fled in haste from
tho Tuilories, and took refugo in England. The Emperor
being deposed, some hopes of peace were at first onter-
tained; but these wero soon extinguished. September saw
Bazaine still shut up in Metz, the army of tho Crown
Prince marching ou Paris, the Kino of Prussia at
Ferrieres, and at length tho capital invostcd by German
troops, and cut off from all colnmunication with the outer
world, except by balloon. Negotiations for an armistice
proved unsuccessful. Laon surrendered, Toul was taken,
Strasburg capitulatod, and the conquered districts of Alsace
and Lorraine were placed under German governors.
In October the Kino of Prussia moved still nearer to
Paris, to Versailles. The Extreme ("Red") Republicans
made an unsuccessful effort to get tho management of
affairs within their grasp; and on the 27th Metz capi-
tulated, and Bazaine and his vast army surrendered.
Great was tho dismay of Paris at this intelligence, and of
the wrath of Gamretta (the " Dictator") at the Marshal.
The " Reds" mado another and more serious attack on the
Government, but were frustrated. Thiers's " voluntary"
mission to obtain the intervention of the great neutral
powers of Europo rosultod only in fruitless negotiations
for an armistico; and the arrangements for the defence
of Paris wore pushed on with increased activity.
In November took placo "the first real German defeat
of the war," in the victory gained by DAurelle de
Paladines over Von der Tann at Orleans. The French
made sorties, both in this month and in December, from
tho boleaguered capital, but they ended only in loss of
life. The seat of Government was removed from Tours to
Bordeaux; various strong places in tho provinces fell into
the hands of the Germans; tho '' Red " party clamoured more
and more for the " Commune," as the only means of saving
France; provisions within tho walls of Paris becamo dearer
and dearer; the besiegers had thoir trials as well as tho
besieged; a severe frost set in before Christmas; and, at
last, as tho year was closing, the long-delayed bombard-
ment commenced, and was vigorously and successfully
carried on by the Germans.
The revival of tho "Eastern Question" by Russia is tho
last topic that can be included in this Introduction.
Wo again quote tho Annual Register:—
"At the end of October, suddenly and without previous warning, tho
Russian Minister, Princk GoRTScUAKorF, addressed a despatch to tho
European Powers stating that Russia no longor recognised tho orligations
of the Treaty of ISM respecting tho neutrality of tho Black Soa. The feel-
ing bad long roen growing, uut only in England, but throughout Europe,
that the time had come for tho removal of the restrictions upon Russia
which that Treaty imposed—if, indeed, such restrictions upon a groat
Power were not in themselves originally a mistake. But the high-handed
manner in which Russia seized the opportunity afforded by the crippled
condition of France not to ask for a reconsideration of the Treaty, but to
declare herself of her own pleasure no longer bound by it, could not for a
moment be tolerated, and Prince Gortsuhakofk's despatch called forth
from Lord Granville a courteous but firm and decided reply, in which
the obligatory character of Trcatio' was strongly insisted upon, and tho
assent of England to the conditions of ltsjo being treated as null and void
absolutely refused.
"Taken In connexion with the civilities that had recently passed between
Russia and Prussia, and tho touo of tho latter country towards England,
there seemed ground for tho belief which was widely entertained that
Prince Gortsciiakotk's note was a diroct menace to England, based upon
a previous understanding with Count Bismarck. But on Mr. Odo Rrs-
sell being at once despatched to the German hu)d-quarters at Versailles to
ascertain the sense of tho Prussian Government on the question, he re-
ceived a positive nssuranco that they had given no sanction to the step;
and at the samo time a proposal was mado by Prussia for a Conference of
the Towers, to bo held in London, for the settlement of tho question, which
was acceded to both by Russia and England, on the condition that it
should assemble 'without forcgono conclusions.* Tims the cloud from tho
East, which had for tho moment assumed threatening proportions, for the
moment passed away. (See Cartoon', 'Not Loose Yet,' p. 2^4, and 'Tho
Russian Garottcr,' p. 235.]
"A subsequent alarm about Luxembourg caused by the declaration of
Co'^nt Bismarck that tho people of that country had failed in preserving their
neutrality, which was in many quarters interpreted as portending Prussian
annexation in defiance of the guarantor, was quieted by a touiperato note
from tho German Chancellor." [Set Cartoon, p. 267.]

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MONDAY, June 20. Earl Russell proposed that the Lords should
ask Her Majesty to appoint a Commission to inquire into the
TON
ask Her Majesty to appoint a Commission to inquire
means best titled to guarantee the security of every part of the Quern's
dominions. He thinks that Lord Granville snubs the Colonies.
Also, he showed his reading, thus :—
"In one of Dryden's plays a man and his wife came upon the stage, and
slut' (1 that, having loved each other as long at they could, and lived together
ho long as was pleasant to both, they had determined to separate. But that
»,,» the immoral sentiment of an immoral poet, and was not a proper guide
for the colonial policy of this country."
We had not heard that the works of "elorious John" had been
selected as the text-book for the Colonial Office, but we entirely agree
with Earl Russell that the above sentiment is decidedly improper.
We should not call Dry hen an " immoral poet," but a noble writer
who sometimes ceased to be a poet, and stooped to immorality. The
motion was resisted. Somebody has well said that the Commission
desired by the Earl already exists, and the Commissioners are known
as Her Majesty's Government. Finally, after a pleasing little debate,
which ended in time to enable the Peers to dress for "a late 8"
dinner (as Lothair says), the proposal was withdrawn.
Sir H. Hoars asked Mr. Ayktos to state "with bis usual
courtesy," what be meant to do about that unfortunate Kensington
Koad. Mr. Ayrton promised the courtesy and the explanation on
another evening. We may as well say that he redeemed his promise,
and gives up the plan. Hence learn a lesson. What all the sarcasms
and violences of political opponents failed to obtain from the right
honourable gentleman was thus gained by Mr. Punch's exquisitely
f en tie but perfectly irresistible Representation of the undesirableneaS
of Mr. AtrtonN course.
Doctor Denison, as we may now call him, apprised the House that
he bad been invited to go to Oxford, to receive from the new Chancellor,
Lord Salisrury, the degree of D.C.L. He requested a brief holiday
for that purpose. Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli begged that he
would go, and might have sung from Cox and Box—
"Saying, 'Sear Sir, you '11 oblige us and honour us,
If j ou '11 accept this as your holi-rfay.'"
It was therefore arranged that Mit. Dodson should dispel the Fogs
'of debate, while the Spraker went to hear himself addressed in very
; choice ancient Italian.
Education-Obstruction was then resumed. Mr. Richard, rising
from Mr. Bright's seat in old days, but not rising to the level of the
argument, as Mr. Bright would have done, placed himself in antago-
nism to the Government, and moved an Amend incut, to the effect that
Grants to the present Denominational Schools should not be
increased,
Attendance should be everywhere compulsory,
Religious instruction should be supplied by voluntary subscription.
Now, on this sectarian Amendment the House debated ibis ninht
and on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. But Mr. Punch, having embodied
his idea of the whole business in a Cartoon so suggestive and so subtle,
that while the simplest mind can comprehend it, the profoundest must
admire it, has no intention of wasting typography upun a renmt of the
bundred-times-uraed arguments. He records his approval of Sir
John Pakington's sentiments. That gentleman declared that ha
would support the Bill in two ways—by his vote, and by not occupying
precious time with long speeches. Mr. Forster announeed that
Government had come to the end of their concessions. Ou those who
delayed the Bill should rest the responsibility. Admirable was one of
Mr Forstrr's sentences, and it told. "It is not of the poor little
children that we are thinking" In the course of debating, Loud R.
Montagu said that the Denominationalists lost more than they gained,
but that they wished to settle the question. Mr. Dixon, of the
League, complained that he and Mh friends were attacked, for they
were the quietest people in the House, and seldom spoke, but
represented a great mass of opinion outside. Mr. Henley, but iu no
bigoted way, stood up for the Catechism, as teaching the great truths
dear to almost all.
On the last night, there was some good speaking by Mr. Mundella,
who asked how spiritual instruction was to be refused unless we
withheld Milton and other religious poets from the schools;
Mr. W. H. Smith declaring, from his large personal knowledge, that
the artisan class was hostile to the exclusion of religion; Mr. Walter
confirmed that testimony, and believed the Bill a wise one, because
tentative; Mr. Hursman galloped over everybody, hut himself came
a moral cropper, and Mr. Gladstone finished with a fine and vigorous
Vol. LIX.—1870.
No. 1512.

answer to all antagonists-the result being that the Seculars went out
nulv 60, and the united Conservatives and Liberals 421. Mr. Richard's
defeat is a matter for as much congratulation as Mr. Punch can oner
on this subject, while disputants block the child's way to school.
Tuesday. Mr. Somerset Braumont (Wakefield) proposed that no
Bishops, hereafter to be consecrated, should sit in the House of Lords.
Needless to say that a motiou of this kind brought out some smart and
sharp sayings from the enemies of the Mil re. But Mu. Gladstone rose
uo and executed judgment upon them. He thought that the presence
of the Prelates in the House of Lords was very valuable, for tliey were
men who had riseu by their merits. He reviewed episcopal history,
and showed that the Bishops, though they might often have been
wrong, had manifested independence and a readiness to suffer for
principle:—
"Ahchrimiop Laid went gallantly to the scaffold, and no man, I believe,
ever behaved better upon it. Every Bishop of the Church of England took
cntetitedlv the spoiling of bis g ods, and in that respect proved himself to be
a successor of the Apostles. What happened in the reign of James the
Skcond when the rishop-' made themselves the leader' of the people on
behalf of liberty uud law r (Inud cheers.') What happened in the reign of
William the THihD, when a large nu mber of Bishops—wrongly as I think,
but with spirit, independence, and dianterestedness, and because of the
temples whioh they enteiUined as to the title of the King to the Crown—
abandoned their temporal advantages, and descended into obscurity, if not
heggnry? 'cheers.') Let us do justice in this matter. The Bishops of the
Church of England may have their faults—no doubt they have. like every
other body of men—but they have eminently been a body distinguished by
independence and regard for character."
Contrary to his custom (not that he binds himself by the faintest rule)
"Disposing men and things Bis Own Majestic Way."
Mr. Punch quotes the above passage, and requests that all anti-
Gladstouian Clergymen will read it aloud to their families on Suuday
next, at breakfast, and " without note or comment," save what may be
silently made by conscience.
Mr. Braumont said that he was a supporter, not only of Mr.
Gladstone but of Mr. Bright, who had used exceeding strong lan-
Suage condemnatory of the presence of Bishops in the House of Lords.
Le regretted, especially "this week," the absence of-"our distin-
guished leader." The motion was rejected by 158 to 102.
Mr. Gilpin made complaint of the late hours kept by the House.
One Member said that such hours were all very well for bachelors who
had no home-charms to attract them. Another very properly said that
able and leading politicians used to accept dinner invitations for Wed-
nesdays and Saturdays only—now the rule seemed to be to accept
whatever invitations were given, and throw the House over, until ten
or eleven. These be truths. Mr. Gladstone thought no rule could
well be made, but promised to try not to bring on " opposed " business
after 12 30. The House divided twice, and then Mr. Gilpin withdrew
his moiion. But more must be heard on the subject. It is nonsense
to say that it is the business of Parliament and not of the public. It is
because the business of the public cannot be done well in what a
Member (recollecting Nantt Ewakt, perhaps) called the Small Hours,
that we wish it done in the great ones. Nothing but dancing, flirting,
and eating lobster-salad can be performed well after midnight, and even
those things had best be let alone, especially the last.
Wednesday The only matter of interest was a Bill for doing a little
justice to the Medical Men who look after the poor. Dr. Bradt said
that these gentlemen were liable to be called out at any hour of the day
or night, to go great distances, in all weathers, for a remuneration
which he justly described as truly disgraceful to those who tender it.
So will everybody say when told that in 239 Unions the average
monthly pay of the doctor is from eightpence to three shillings a case,
and in 384 from three shillings to seven shillings a case. This bill is
to provide a superannuation scheme, enabling the Unions to give the
retiring medicel man a small allowance. He gets less, said MkMuntz,
for attending a large district than Members pay their butlers. Yet he
voted against the Bill, as did 27 others, but there were 139 for it
.
Sir George Jenkinson wants to establish a Court of Appeal in the
case of Capital Sentences, but his plan was declared by the Attorney-
General to be ill-considered, and it was withdrawn. Mr. Bruce
defended himself for having reprieved a murderer who was so curiously
constructed that his execution by the cord would have been difficult,
and said that the commutation had been made to avoid a public
scandal, and had nothing to do with the pain which carrying out the
sentence might have caused to the assassin.
Thursday. The House of Lords was crammed with Peers, anxious to
debate or hear debates on the Irish Laud Bill. But as Mr. Punch's
readers have probably heard as much as they desire to hear of the
details of this Bill, it shall suffice to say that (new Lord O'Hag an,
Irish Chancellor, having taken his seat, with graceful compliment from
Grace of Richmond) a variety of Opposition Amendments were put,
discussed, and carried against Government. They may be described
as having been made in the Landlord interest, and as some of them are
opposed to the principle of the Bill, Mr. Punch may assume that his
friend, Mr. Gladstone, will find some means of convincing the Peers
that his scheme may be best left intact. Lord O'Hagan lost no time
in making his maiden speech iu the Upper Chamber, supporting the
Bill, and thanking " a noble nation " for attempting the reparation of
wrong.
But what is life without fun P Lord Clancarty proposed that no
compensation should be given to an evicted tenant who had exhibited
to his neighbours an example of habitual drunkenness, vice, or misde-
meanour. But Lord Salisrury was sarcastic on this attempt to make
Irishmen virtuous through the agency of draining and fencing, and
inquired whether the judges would have to take info consideration the
question whether the tenant had paid such attention to his neighbour's
wife as should attract the unfavourable notice of Lord Penzance.
The remarkable proposal was withdrawn.
Punch has said how the Commons were occupied, but must add bis
tribute to Sir R. Knightley, who declared, pityingly, that Mr. Glad-
stone laboured like a galley-slave at the oar—truatea he would have
stamina to curry him through the Session, but added that if the
Premier succumbed, it might be recorded on his tomb that he was,
like Actn:on (can Sir R. K. have looked into that legend lately 'ij torn
to piecrg by his own dogs.
Punch was pleased with Mr. Peter Taylor, the other day, for
agitating in favour of making the Reporters more comfortable. But
why won't he keep in our good books P Why did he say that the
Guu-Tax was intended to deprive the People of Arms P If this meant
anything, it meant that the People might want arms to shoot at the
Executive. Now, Mr. Taylor, is there any use in such nonsense P
By the way, the Licence is reduced to ten shillings.
Friday. The Lords disported themselves with the Irish Land Bill
much as on the previous night, snd Mr. Punch refers to the words in
which he has described the lormer proceedings as exactly descriptive of
the latter also. Lord Salisrury compendiously stated the principle
of the Bill as being that " it is better to pay compensation than to be
shot," and Lord Granville thanked the Chancellor of Oxford
for putting his disagreeable things into epigrammatic form, instead of
saying them in a diffuse manner. Lord Granville's iugenious cour-
tesy could not be better illustrated than in such a compliment. The
Lord Chancellor hinted at pettifogging alterations, and this aggra-
vated the Duke of Richmond, who indignantly denied that he was
inclined to pettifoggery. Many noble Conservatives would not obey
their nominal leader, and divided against him as well as against
Government.
Mr. Punch has already stated what happened in the Commons, and
only adds that Mr. Mundella, in alluding to Mr. Bright, quoted Hie
Laureate's exquisite little lyric—
"0 for the touch of a vanished hand!
And the sound of a voice that is still!"
Which quotation was "poetically pretty, but historically false," as
Gilrert A'Beckett wrote. Mr. Punch rejoices to know that Mr.
Bhight's hand probably holds a very good cigar, and that his voice is
still—as fine as ever. For which relief much thanks to " the Monster
Head of Orme," and the demesnes that there adjacent lie.
FOOLS AND THEIR MONEY, ETC.

THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.
Bring the Papers of the Boompje Club, collected by its Secretary.
For further particulars see the present Series.
PEKFATIA L,
O all and singular,
individually and col-
lectively Boompje!
The history ol the
Boompje Club re-
sembles that of most
other great and flou-
rishing institutions.
It has been develop-
ed successfully out
of small beginnings.
Such remarks as
appear here are
made in my capa-
city of Secretary,
aud on my own per-
sonal responsibility.
* * * »
No man is a
Boompje all at
once.
This must he
borne in mind, be-
cause we didu't, as
a Club, begin by
being Boompjes.
We, as it were,
awoke one morning in a new country to find ourselves Boompjes.
One of our party—we started as a party and continued as a Club—
looked out of the Hotel window at Rotterdam, by the river-side, and
says he, gravely,
"Do you know where we are P" There was a pause, and he con-
tinued, We are on the Boompje."
Thereupon, somebody said, Let us be Boompjes," and somebody
else said, "Let's," and the motion was carried nem. con.
[On investigation we found he was right. We were on the Boompje.
"The steamers," said our friend, appealing to the infallible Murray,
"land their passengers on the fine quay called the Boompje." * * *
"The philosopher Battle ended his days in one of the houses on the
Boompje." This was enough.]
We find (so runs the extract from the Boompje diary of that memo-
rable day) that we have hitherto been Boompjes without knowing it.
This is evident on examining Boompje principles.
Boompje Principles.
Examples.—To say at ten a.m. " I'm off"!" and to be off to Anywhere
(America, for example), before eleven, is to act upon Boompje principles.
A man may act on Boompje principles, unconsciously, and without
being a member of the society, as that gentleman did, who marched up
and down his room for one hour and a quarter, overhead, while I was
trying to write the first stanzas of my poem, The Fisherman of Scheven-
ingen. I had begun :-
It was a Fisher of Schevening,
Who went out in the evening,
but at this point one of our party (the names will be given soon)
knocked at the door, on Boompje principles (i.e.. he did it so sud-
denly that I started up—boompje'd—from my chair), and informed
me, when I asked bim "if it wasn't pretty," that "evening wasn't a
rhyme to Schevening, because Schevening was pronounced Skayven-
ing:" and then, having only come in to ask me what time it was
(which I couldn't tell him), he walked out also, on Boompje principles,
i.e., banging the door violently. So, when 1 set to work again, 1 saw
no prospect of a rhyme to Schevening, as pronounced, unless the poem
could be supposed to be written by an Irishman, who would pronounce
"evening " as " evening," which I rejected, after dashing it off on one
Boompje impulsive principle, and tearing up the paper on another.
It was a Fisher of Schevening
Whose .... ravening.
Something about "hunger" here. On second thoughts it occurred
to me, that if you could talk of " stabling a horse," why couldn't a
poet speak of" havening a boat P"
"Oho!" I cried, inspired, "the Boompje!!" and forthwith wrote :—
A Fisherman of Schevening
His little boat was havening,
When
And here the man above began to walk about. Then there oame a
hanging of doors in the passage; then a creaking of a door, some-
where, at intervals. So that when the man didn t walk, the doors
hanged; when the doors didn't banged, the door craked; and when I
was going to ring my bell violently, and say to the waiter, "For
Heaven's sake, stop this inf ," the noises ceased, and, passing my
hand through my hair, I once more set myself to find line No. 3 for
A Fisherman of Schevening,
His little boat was havening,
( a storm
When< a bell
( a—a—
Arrival of a party, and "would I mind letting a lady see the rooms P"
With pleasure: I'm going out. On with hat; off with self. Boompje!
Coming to think of it, I don't kuow anything more remarkable than
the way in which we suddenly struck on the title. Came down, as it
were, whop upon it, Boompje!
It s a wonderful word. Boompje!! If any one doubts me, let him
try it as applicable to all sorts of occasions.
You talk of your acquaintance, the Dokr op Upshihe, as "TJpsitrRB"
or " old Uppt," after being introduced to him, and saying good-bye to
him at the corner of a street. This is Boompje.
You rise in the morning; out of bed at last. Boompje!
You bound along the pavement, buoyant, light-hearted, and happy.
Boompje!
See the rollicking carelessness of the porters in dealing with your
portmanteau and trunks at Dover and Calais. Boompje principles.
Boompje!
You are sad, despondent, and depressed. B-o-o-mp-je.
Yoa are up again. Boompje!!
You go out for a ride, in Rotten Row, on a mettlesome charger,
at so much an hour, and tell a friend that you are trying a horse with
a view to purchase. Boompje I Boompje!
You have all your electro-plate out and silver too (if any) for a leg of
mutton and potatoes. Boompje!
In short, if the intelligent reader will but give his mind to it, and
just try the word on every possible occasion, he will find it not only
suitable, but exactly appropriate to all possible occasions.
In short, Boompje is everywhere in some form or another. In due
course, as we proceed, I will give yon the Hymn of the Boompjes.
• * » • » , » * *
NOTE POST-PBEFATIAL.
Note.—The mystery or secret of the Boompje Association lies in the
mode of pronouncing or giving effect to the word Boompje. It is two
syllables; the first (it is scarcely necessary to add) being Boomp, while
the second (it is important to notice) is je. All that the present writer is
at liberty to say on this subject to those whose destiny has not as yet
led them to be Boompjes, is, that something of the force of the words
may be gathered by coming down heavily, as it were, on the first, namely,
the Boomp, and coming up, lightly and sharply, on the je. Boomp on
one side of an ordinary see-saw, and Je on the other, will convey some
idea of this mysterious word to the uninitiated. In any case the Je is
to be Je up. Allans!
THE TOUR COMMENCES.
The Boompje Parly prior to Boompjeism.
One morning Bund comes to me and says, "I want to make a party
to go abroad." As a commencement, we went out for a walk together,
and called on Maullle, the eminent artist, who had just finished his
great picture of Home Again— (subject: a young cavalier has rushed
into an Elizabethan drawing-room to meet his wife or somebody—repre-
sented by nobody being there—and through the door, which in his
haste he has left open, are seen five interiors in perspective, one after
the other, with the hall-door open in the distance, and a very little
perspective man taking down a very little perspective portmanteau
from a little perspective coach—sold for something over four figures,
on the honour of a Boompje)—and was anxious to get away for a holi-
day. "Now," says Bund, who is an enthusiastic musician, and an
amateur of the violoncello, " Here's the party: Painting, Music, and
Literature." I was "Literature," and deputed to keep a diary.
Somebody suggested that Thite wasn't "company," and while we
were debating this point, enters to us Dickt Gooch. "Look here,"
says he, " yon fellars : if I come with yon," making it a favour, " I must
be back in ten days, because of the London season."
This being an imputation upon our social status, we all asserted that
not only must we be back in that time or less, but that we experienced
the utmost difficulty in tearing ourselves away from the crowds of
parties, balls, concerts, teas, drums, &c., to which we had been invited
at the rate of five a day for the next two months. (Boompje!)
[Boompje note.—Gooch had managed (I afterwards discovered) with
some difficulty to get an invitation Tor a private operatic performance
at the house of somebody whom he didn t know, and this represented
hit engagements for the season. But a genuine Boompje of London
Society would rather die than own such a melancholy fact.l

WICKED WASTE.
Everyrody knows Horace Walpole's receipt for dressing a
cucumber. "Buy it, wash it, slice it, add oil, vinegar, and pepper—
and then fling it out of the windows."
Our military authorities seem to have adopted a similar rule for
dealing with our soldiers, in the late hot weather. It is true that a
full private costs a good deal more than a cucumber. But the full
piivate is among the human fruits of civilization what, the cucumber is
among vegetables—one of the most costly. He is said to cost John
Bull, on an average, £100 a year,—taking him with his appurtenances,
the extensive aud expensive machinery for buying, washing, slicing,
oiling, vinegaring, and peppering him.
This expensive and wonderful product, in his shiny shako, tight
stock, close-buttoned coarse woollen tunic and trousers, contract boots
and belts, with his sixty-pound load of great-coat, mess-tin, knapsack,
rifle and cartouche-box, «e set to execute long marches of from twelve
to eighteen miles, over dusty roads, in the full heat of the hottest sun
that has shone for years! The strongest men suffer, but struggle on;
the weaker fall out; the weakest drop and die.
If that isn't flinging the cucumber out of window, what is itP
Yet this is what our sapient "military authorities" have been doing
last week. We read in the Globe:—
"On Wcdnetday last, which was one of the hottest days we have had for
years, the (.pvl-nnartrrs of the 2nd battalion of .he 9th Regiment, with the
ilepot of the 2nd battalion of the 10th Regiment, marched from West Ham to
KiD-tston-on-Thames; and on the same day the 91th Regiment marched from
Guildford to Aldershot. The distances were not unusually long—nineteen
miles in one case, and about eleven in the other—so that they might easily
have been nccomplished, in the latter oase, either between four and nine
o'clock in the morning, or between the same hours in the evening; and in the
former case, the distance might, without inconvenience, have been divided
between those periods. ...' Private Maloney, 9th Regiment, fell on reaching
Kingston, and died at twenty minutes pa»t ten o'clock the same night.' The
94th Regiment had not marched more than three miles on the way from
Guildford when a corporal fell from sunstroke and died at eight o'clock the
same evening. The marches were made in heavy marching order .... On
the Tuesday's march of the same detachments of the 9th and 10th Regiments,
from Warley to West Ham, a sergeant fell out from the effects of the sun, who
is since reported to have died.''
If this be true, it is simply monstrous. Who gives such ordersP
To say nothing of common humanity, economy is at stake! JuHir
Bull has a right to know who is the ass in office who is allowed to
fling his C09tly cucumbers out of the window in this way.
OLD ENGLISH SONG AND SUMMER.
Sore O the weather and the crops!
With a 'mather, woo't P and a way, gee wo!
A shower were pearls and golden drops
To the husbandmen, by my faith, I trow.
But Swithun will anon be here;
it will come down then, or it may before;
Old ale is better than table beer:
And there raineth no rain but it aye doth pour.
In harvest time an skies be wet,
So there sprout no grain, why the corn may swell;
Drought never bred dearth in England yet,;
And the best of all burdens is ding, dong, bell!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Again, and after sadly brief lapse, we speak of mourning. We deplore the loss of our old,
warm-hearted, faithful friend, Frederick Mullett Evans, who, after severe illness, borne with
manly constancy, now rests from the labours of an energetic and honourable life. He was en-
dowed with high abilities, which he exercised with unflagging vigour almost to the end; and his
generous nature chiefly prized worldly success because it enabled him to promote the happiness of
those who shared his love. His course is finished, his work is done, and they who inscribe these
lines to his memory will never lament a more kind, more genial, or more loyal friend.

"Mr. Henley inquired who was to pay for arms, such as muskets, Ace,

"The Chancellor of tur Exchequer said that he had often beard of a
man being termed a chosen vessel, but never of a vessel being termed a man.
However, the Government would look seriously into the question."

A Meeting under the presidency of the Duke or Marlrorough
was held at Willis's Rooms the other evening to discuss "The Future
of the Church of England." With regard to that future little clair-
voyance much to be relied on was manifested by any of the speakers;
but a Mr. Antonio Brady said something remarkable. He observed
that " the Church had driven out the masses, and was now only the
Church of the privileged few." There are masses and masses, and,
simulating the latter, mock-masses. It is to be wished the Church of
England would drive out these masses, and the mimes who celebrate
them.
Un Mot de Madame Ramsbotnam.
Mrs. Ramsrotham (Mrs. Malaprop's friend) was much grieved
about the fire at Perr. Recounting the details to a friend, she said,
"You will be glad to hear that though the British Consul lost almost
everything, he managed to save his anchovies." It turned out that she
meant the Archives.
More Fever than Fodder.
A Physician advertises a book on "Hay Fever." This work has

The Absolutists of Spain appear to have taken a leaf out of the book of Bis-

According to a recent telegram from Madrid:—
"The Central Carlist Junta have concluded the discussion of the manifesto which is

approved the re-establishment of the Inquisition."
Ha ha! This is at all events fair and aboveboard; there is no hypocrisy in
sucb a candid avowal. It is precisely in the Prussian Minister's style; but no
less in that of another personage, whom Spanish Carlists are more likely to have

OXFORD COMMEMORATION, 1870.
When Oxford of late to elect began,
The whole of our intellectual clan
Thought Salisrury far the most suitable man
The Chancellor's chair for filling;
And high were the hopes of the Dons that he,
And nobody else, might Chancellor be;
And great was their sober, donnish glee
When he answered, "Markis is willing."
The hour has come and the man is here;
The grave, grey city gives him a cheer.
Discarding entirely her old, austere,
Conventional way of behaving;
The trees are vocal to give him thanks,
Presenting their arms as he passes their ranks;
And I sis jumps np to peep over her banks,
Where all her flags are waving.
At first there are hints of a rainy day;
But the clouds in compliment clear away,
When they find that he really means to stay,
And has reached his destination;
And so he can sit at the river-side,
Where the eight-oartd galleys past him glide;
And Alma Mater presents him with pride
To her floating population.
Now Music is master; and every throat
Possessed of a single singable note
Trolls out all the songs that its owner can quote,
Whether Shaksprare's, Milton's, or Herrick's;
Old Oxford behaves like a crazy thing:
The domes go dancing round in a ring;
The very spires are beginning to sing,
And "the High" has gone into hysterics.
To-day each College, to share its glee,
Has invited a country-cousin to tea;
(Or something stronger it perhaps may be,
As Allsopp, Bass, or Burton :)
All Souls' and Abingdon look quite grand;
And Woodstock and Worcester are hand-in
While Iffley and Oriel take their stand
Next door to Sandford and Merton.
"The Corn" sends up a resounding roar ;—
It has not been so trodden on ever before;
Then into "the Broad " the multitudes pour
And vainly to make their way try.
The people with tickets, by tens and twelves,
Crowd round " the Sheldonian"—lucky elves!
Where "the Heads" on the railings are nodding them-
selves,—
Those great Idola Theatri.
Let us take one look at the scene inside,
And mark how, proud with an honest pride.
The Chancellor stands, and his brilliant bride,
Two highly-gifted creatures!
The Undergraduates, might and main.
Are cheering them both, again and again;
And nobody thinks of Salisbury Plain
As he looks on the lady's features.
And then they must needs give new Degrees I
(There were 80, at least, in the shade of the trees !)
And the ruthless robes made a mocking breeze
When the wearers came to don them;
For all the new Doctors, of course, received
The scarlet gown, all crimson-sleeved;
And they "bore their blushing honour," and grieved
To find it so " thick upon them."
Then the Chancellor flies, with unfailing powers,
To dinners and dances, to fetes and flowers,
And, at last, to secure a few sleep-stilled hours
At " Omnium Animarum;"
But first, with a patience nearly sublime,
He hears Essays in prose and Addresses in rhyme,
And an "Ode," adapted in tune and time
To the special " Use of Sarum."

BIG BEN IN DANGER

alt bat been burned

Big Ben — which-
ever is the major,

ment, which might,

a meal—to say no-
thing of their costly

campanile! It
seeuis we keep four
tons of loose cocoa-
nut fibre under the
hell and clock, to
deaden the fall of
the weights, incase
any of them should
t..kc it into its head—if leaden weights hare heads, as men's heads
have leaden weights—to come crashing down.
This seems certainly the remotest dinger to provide against, we
ever heard of. Are we to understand that clock-weights and works
are in the habit of thus unhooking themselves P or is it a vagary pecu-
liar to such weights and works in the Westminster Clock Tower—a
n suit, perhaps, of their unsettled habits, resulting from the disturb-
ances of which that bell and clock have been the occasion and object.
On the whole, and looking at the matter as an outsider, it, strikes
Mr. Punch that the danger of fire from four tons of loose cocoa-nut
fibre, stored close to heated flues, and, even without them, liable to
smoulderand burst into flame at anytime from the "dottle" of awork-
mau's pipe, or an attendant's tread upon a loose lucifer—to say not hing
of the possible incendiary consequences of Mr. Denison's un-oflicial,
and Mr. Atrton's official, connection with the clock—is far more
si-rious than that of any possible damage either to the clock-weights or
the campanile, from the former taking it into their head to jump on*
their suspenders, and crash through the floors of the latter.
Considering—as the French say in their exposis de motifs—the heats
which the Westminster Palace has engendered among its architects,
clockmakers, amateur and professional vtnlilation doctors, Commis-
sioners of Works, Bathetic Members of Parliament, and all connected
wi'h it, in any degree however remote;
Considering Mr. Barry's probable frame of mind under his late
treatment by Mr. Ayuton;
Considering Mr. Atrton's power of healing to a red heat the
tempers of all be comes in contact with;
Considering the late hours the House has been keeping, and the
generally exasperated and desperate state of the minds of Ministers and
Members from excessive and unprofitable talk;
Considering more particularly the Education Debates and the Trish
Land BUI, and the amount of highly combustible material thereby
accumulated in the minds of classes so excitable as Archdracon
Dknison and other High Church divines, determined dissenters,
Irish agitators, and Irish landlords;
It seems to Mr. Punch that special precautions against fire ought at
this moment to be taken in the Palace at Westminster.
"There is no smoke without fire" is a wholesome proverb.
Think of the immense quantity of smoke which has been lately raised
in both Houses round the two questions of Irish Land Tenure and
National Education, and it will at once be admitted that the fire
cannot, in fact, be far off.
It is Punch's proud privilege to roast members of the Legislature;
but he does not wish to employ for that useful purpose the means
which, according to Charles Lamr, the Chinese employed for roasting
pigs—burning down the building which contained them. For pigs this
process was costly: fur Members of Parliament it would be ruinous.
A ROYAL ACADEMICAL REVIEW.
Drar Punch,
I have not been able to visit the Academy this year. So
much the worse for the Academy. But as Punch and England expect
every man to do his Academy, I have procured a Catalogue from a
friend, and have selected certain numbers, which I now give your
readers, with the way in which the subjects ought to have been treated,
and would have been, had / manipulated them. Should your readers,
on seeing the pictures, be disappointed, having expected greater thinirs
from my notice, that is not my fault, bat their, and the artists', mis-
fortune. Yours, artistically,

Blest Huooins, and his newly-wedded bride,
Were basking on the siinds at ebb of tide.

"Yes," she replied, with meditative air;
"So hot down here; what must it be up there P"
Her parasol she pointed to the sky,
And added, " I suppose it broils on high."
"As ignorant you are," he spoke in play,
"As pretty and that's something, dear, to say."
She pinched his ear; and he pursued, "Behold!
Those fleecy clouds aloft—they 're deuced cold.

They are considered to be drifts of snow."
"Oh, yes !" she cried, " I dare say. That's your inn.

"Yes; but Mont Blanc's a mountain, and," she said,
"Has, therefore, always snow upon its head.
So don't tell me, because it is no use."

Working Hen and Talking Men.
The Collective Wisdom in the House of Commons is known by its
much speaking, which commonly keeps our loquacious legislators up
till past, three o'clock ia the morning. What, it is asked, is the work'
nf the hardest worked working man compared to that of a Member of
ParliamentP Little enough in point of duration; but work is one
thing and talk is another.
THE DURHAM CAT-ASTROPHE.
The indignation expressed at the flogging, by Magistrate's order, of
a ruffianly prisoner called Maw, who assaulted a warder in Durham
Gaol, seems to us so far appropriate to its subject, that it is eminently
Jfiw-kisb.
The writer in the local paper, against which Canon Greenwell,
who directed this scratching of Maw's back, has moved for an informa-
tion, thinks it was quite bad enough to mew Maw in prison without
taking the cat to him besides. But, so far as we can see, that nioe-
tailed animal is one which might with excellent effect be employed in
the correction of wife-beaters, child-torturers, garotters, police and
warder-assaulters, and all that class of ruffians. Her tails are the only
ones they are likely to listen to, or find improvement from.
We Need not Name Them.
In an admirable article on Education, the Times says that "a certain
alternative implies arrangements for the employment (as teachers) of
Religious Volunteers." There can be no objection to any good Volun-
teer's teaching in a Sunday or other school, but we beg distinctly to
apprise certain Volunteers who assemble in the Temple, and other legal
precincts, that the invitation does not apply to them. Their tender of

foreign to his nature, that only on such authority

Tuesday. The Lords
worked hard at, the

Nevertheless, the Bill
went through Com-
mittee, the Karl of

the debate with a
dt duration of his

satisfadion with the

his opinion that the

men to preach better sermons; and if the very proper answer be made
that yon cannot expect 20,000 gentlemen to be all clever, the replica-
tion should be, that we do not, but that as most clergymen can read,
those who are not gifted with the art of composition may desirably
select discourses from the vast treasury to be found in the works of
older divines. "What" Sia Roger dr Coverley's chaplain "did,
and Addison approved, cannot be wrong."
Then did the. Government get, not a victory, bat a decided beating.
This wa< mainit drawn down upon them by Mr. Grant Duff, who,
in resisting a motion by Colonel Syk.es for further investigation into
an Indian military grievance, spoke iu an unkind and unjust manner
about the officers who had lost their regiments in the mutiny. The
Huuse was indignant, aud Mr. Gladstone sought to soften (town its
anger, but on division it was decided by 113 to 93, majority against
Ministers, 21, that the Queen should be addressed on the subject.
Mr Grant Duff is an exceptionally clever man, but he made this
terrible blunder by not being clever enough to manifest a feeling
which we have no doubt he possesses. Englishmen are not Gushers,
but they resent the semblance of heartlessness.
Wednesday. The Commons sat in Committee on a most valuable and

The name is derived from the Latin acluarius. which simply means
qui acta describit veloci stylo, eaqye descripla deinde recital. Put that
into the Bill, aud leave the Judges to interpret it. If you want to
know where Mr. Punch found the description, he will tell you, for he
scorns small secresy. In Dr. Adam Littleton's "Latine Dic-
tionary" (1703), whioh he bought in Tottenham Court Road for two
aud sixpence, and a little boy carried home for twopence—also the

Headed know all," as Mr. Tennyson says, with* another word which
Mr. Punch omits, he being of excessive politeness.
Mh. Ri lands (Liberal), formerly Mayor of, and now Member for
Warrington, moved the Second Reading of a Bill for closing Public
Houses on 8unday. Mr, Birlet (Conservative Member for Man-
chester) seconded Mr. Aldekman Lawrence opposed, until the
hour of adjournment. This Bill shall not pass. Mr. Punch hates,
detests, execrates, and abominates druukerme»s, and there you have
his faith in monosyllable, dissyllable, trisyllable, aud quatersyllable,
and he would punish an offence committed in liquor (or against liquor,
ye adulterating fiends) with a double punishment. But nobody, with
Mr. Punch's leave, shall prevent thirsty men, women, and children,
from getting a drink of beer in the course of a hot Sunday walk.
Mr Rylands, Mr. Rylands,
Heaven sends moisture to the dry lands,
Though the day bears scarlet letter;
Mr. Birlky, Mr. Birlet,
Yuu must get up precious early
Ere Punch owns your plan a better.
No, Gentlemen. You mean so exceeding well, and there is so much to
be said about, British drunkenness, aud what it produoes, that it is not
pleasant to fight you for the key of the public-bouse: but fight we
must, if you want to lock out decent folks because others abuse the
gifts of Nature. Punch bears you no malice, but get your hands up, for
this Bill shall not pass.
Thursday. The Lords considered a Rill for amending the mode in
which Solicitors are paid for conveyancing business. This reform,
come when it may, will be due to Mr. Punch, who, some years ago,
exuosed the vices of the existing system (which is hard upon the high-
niinded and artis'io conveyancer) in so masterly a way by an illustra-
tion i f its working in the case of a Work-Table, that the Profession
would have sent him a Testimonial, but that (he supposes) they thought
be might not like it. He respects their scruples, but they may send it
now—he promises not to be offended, if the article be handsome
enough A Medical Act Amendment Bill also made progress. It
gives power to the Medical Council to declare a Quack "infamous"
and "disgraceful," which is well; but it should include a clause for
fl igging him at a cart's tail if he dares to bring an action against a
newspaper for publishing the fact that he has been branded on his
dirty forehead. There are scores of Quacks whom the journals would
scarify next week, but for the state ot the law, which gives the most
despicable creature the power to put the most respectable newspaper
to a heavy expense. Let it be enacted that no action shall lie for any
publication of the Council's declaration, or for any comments there-
upon. Will the Loud Salisisury please see to this when the report
comes up P
Education again, till nearly two in the morning.
Friday. Lord Westrurt called the attention of the Lords to the
choked-up state of the Judicial Committee, the Grand Court of Final
Appeal for the Empire. The other day there were 370 appeals waiting
to be heard, and 150 new ones are coming from Bengal. This Court
is especially prized by the native Indians; and Lord Westrurt
pointed out the in judiciousness of neglecting them. The rich Indian
whose well-tutored mind sends him to his Queen's home tribunal for
justice, deserves all consideration. The Lord Chancellor promised
a Bill to rectify matters.
Like Debrett, the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill is " Under the Revision
and Correction of the Nobility," and Punch hopes that they will attend
to the above titles as carefully as they do to the record of their own
in the said Golden Book.
Mr. Stanspeld explained that high-class costs had been allowed in
the case of the poor little Welsh Fasting Girl, because the publio mind
had been excited, and high-class lawyers had been employed. A. fair
answer; bat ought not the best kind of law to be used in all cases,
even if it be the dearestP She rid an gave a man a bad shilling for
conveying him in a bad coach; but this is not a precedent for Govern-
ments.
Is it needful to say that Education "brought up" the rear of the
week's history P We might say, with Mr. Rorretson's kind permis-
sion (unasked) that School and H P. are having a tremendous simul-
taneous run. And, "as we have introduced the subject," we add that
the latter play is stuck as full of smart things as a tipsy cake is of
almonds—and it is strictly within the Essence (and if it weren't, do
you think we should care P) to say that there is the spirit of true
comedy in Mrs. Bancroft's reason for wishing to see her lover in Par-
liament. "I should so like to hear you Called to Order."
POACHED EGOS AND THEIR POA0HERS.
The Agricultural Journal, under the heading of " An Egg Poacher,"
narrates an exploit of a gamekeeper who, iu the neighbourhood of
Camborne, Cornwall, after several ineffectual attempts to catch a
barrier hawk, too cunning ever to come within shot, by means of a gin
baited first with a rabbit, then with a bird, and next with a weasel,
finally succeeded in trapping it wit h the bait of an adder, whioh he had
killed, ooiled up as though it were living. Aha 1 and so the egg-
poacher was caught at last, thinks Mr. Benjamin Bowrell. Not
exactly so, Benjamin; the egg-poacher was the mere vermin used for
a bait, and not the reputed vermin, hut really in a great measure useful
creature which it allured, and whereby it would have been killed and
eaten if alive. It is a pity that gamekeepers are generally actuated by
a zeal which is not at all according to knowledge, but is, on the con-
trary, according to ignorance, the grossest, of natural history. Beneath
its influence thoy shoot down, under the name of a hawk, every one of
tho Falconidie without mercy and without discrimination. Harriers
and buzzards live chiefly on mice and reptiles, and the same may be
said of the kestrel, which many a clown, no better than a cockney,
confounds with the sparrowhawk. They are very beautiful birds, and
not only oruamentat but useful, especially the harrier hawk that
destroys such egg-poachers as adders. When a gamekeeper shoots
a bird like this he makes much the same mistake as that of shooting
at the pigeon and killing the erow, or rather shooting at the crow ana
killing the pigeon. Even sparrowhawks, and other really destructive
birds of prey, should be kept under, but not exterminated. If they
are of no good in a state of nature, of what are they in the British
Museum P
Penny readings have become popular institutions in the rural dis-
tricts. Could not some of the resideut gentlefolks, by way of a change
from reciting, tor the instruction and eutertainment of rustic audiences
t he poem of the Chameleon, for example, or the fable of tho Hare and
the Tortoise, occasionally enlighten their minds by a familiar account of
the various birds and other animals, with whose sight they are familiar,
but about whose habits aud manners the majority of them know nothing,
and entertain a variety of absurd persuasions P The idea Of teaching
your gamekeeper anything on the subject of eggsnught to be as absurd
as that of instructing your grandmother in a method of eating theru;
and at any rate gamekeepers might be expected to know all about
poached eggs; but few of them probably are aware that adders poach
them, and that in killing a harrier hawk they are destroying their own
ally against egg-poanhers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BOBBY NOT ON HIS BEAT.

A CASE OF GREEK CONSCIENCE.
A Brigand lately executed in Greece wrote a letter of dying withes
to his brother. From a translation of this document, originally pub-
lished in the Phos, the writer appears to have been brought to some
i of his situation. As thus :—
% 9 r
\ yV I EDNESDAy morning, in last week, and between the
\J \l hours of 1 and 2 a.m., thieves undisturbed, at
their leisure, bent apart two bars in I he grated
™ ™ window-shutters of a watchmaker's shop in Cheap-
side, and cut a disc of glass out of one of the panes.
They had just hooked out a chain, which, unfortunately for the daring
and ingenious fellows, had dropped between the shutters and the
window, when their noise aroused the watchman in charge of the pre-
mises, and caused that Argus to raise an alarm, which put them
to flight in safety These particulars are gathered from a newspaper,
which mentions, besides, the watchmaker's name. That is omitted
here, brcause the possibility that Punch could publish, or be let in to
copy, a covert advertisement, must not even be suspected. But, of
course the operators who trepanned Mk. Htthen's window were
genuine thieves. Then this is the second operation on plate-glass which
artists of that denomination have bee.n able to take their time in per-
forming, sinee the other day, in the midst of a chief City thoroughfare.
How can these facts be accounted for, except on the supposition that
there are tares in the City Police corn P Can that generally fine and
trusty body of men contain any members of the dangerous classes who
have crept into it in disguiseP Js it possible that the civic authorities
have set thieves to catch thieves unwittingly, and not according to the
proverbP Was the leisurely perforation of windows in Fleet Street
and Cheapside practicable by connivance of accomplices in blue P
These questions will perhaps engage the attention of the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen. There is something so rotten in the state of their
police arrangements, that, if scientific housebreaking continues to be
practised in open gaslight within their boundaries, people wdl soon
begin to say that the Mausion House is as bad as the Home Office.
"Brother Nicolaki, I salute you. My brother, I enjoin you to give 60
drachmas to the church of 8t. Paraskeyi, in the village of Limogarthi; also
to 8t. John of Palcochori 30 drachmas; give a gallon of oil to the cruich of
Neochori, and a gallon of oil to St. Nicholas of Divri. Give a gallon of oil to
the Virgin of Xeriotissn, and when you return to our native place give to the
poor all you choose for the salvation of my soul."
These injunctions are not followed by reference to any fund out of
which the expense of executing them was to be defrayed, except the
following:—
"Do what you like with the cows that I have at Divri.'
It may be surmised that this legacy was hardly considerable enough
to meet the charges of fulfilling the pious intentions above specified,
and sundry others whereof the detail follows :—
"Make a garland, write my name upon it, and with it crown the head of
St Nicholas in our church. Do not quarrel on account of the disputed cattle
with Yannaka Founta, or elso his curse will follow me, but take for settlement
what he chooses to give you."
Besides practising moderation and forbearance by posthumous proxy,
he proposes likewise to perform expiation:—
"When I was a lad I robbed from the church the holy books of Father
Veta, and he cursed me; therefore, you must find a priest, and bring him to
my grave to bless it, otherwise I am afraid that my body will not be changed."
This clerk of St. Nicholas—a saint to whom, by the way, it may have
been noticed that he bequeathed a special offering out of his brother's
pocket—had, in his education, evidently enjoyed religious teaching, of
a sort, combined with secular. However he had been impressed with
some idea of the obligation to provide for his own—still at the cost of
his brother:—
"If you do not intend to return to our birthplace, take care of my child and
treat him as your own; and execute faithfully all that I command you,here."
He recognised the obligation of almsgiving; by the same means :—
"When you meet ragged beggars, receive them, and assist tbem at much
as you can, otherwise God will not permit the salvation of my soul.''
Qui faeitper alivm facit per se was his economical maxim applied to
good works. They were necessary, in his view, but could be done by
deputy. He gave his brother a power of attorney to be charitable to
the poor, and to himself also. Had that brother, however, bien a
perfect stranger, and had he met him in a mountain pass near Marathon,
or on the highway, could he lu»ve more coolly charged him with any
commission than with one such as this:—
"I left my watch with Mr. Rizoli-Manoli. Go to him and give 23
drachmas. Sell your own and take mine as a keepsake."
Doubtless this remarkable specimen of a penitent thief regarded his
own particnlar brother only with a higher degree of the same fraternal
affection as that which he had always cherished tor bis brother man; for
mankind at large. He subsisted by putting his bands into their
pockets during life, and he thought to buy salvation by putting them
after death into his brother's.
Most people have seen the photographs of certain lately executed
Greek brigands' heads in the picture-shop windows. Nothing, one
would think, can be more probable than that one of those heads
belonged to the subject of the preceding remarks.

The other day a well-known Economist was found by his friends m

and said emphatically—Hink iHa lachryma!
Just Worth Mentioning.
The Saturday Review advises Mr. James Grant (of the
Advertiser) to do what another gentleman did a great many years ago
"in the case of Punch" That is, to retire from a periodical because it
assailed the Pope. We do not know whether Mr. Grant (ultra-
Protestant) would think such a cause sufficient to justify the course
suggested; but that is Lis affair. Ours is, to express no sham regret
tbat the Saturday Berieut permits either ignorance or spite to blotch its
pages, which do habitual service to literature and to morals.

only speculate whether they rtturn the better for the trip.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.
Bund we elected Commodore, Commander-in-Chief, and President, of
the Travelling Society, whose object was to be the pioneer of civilisa-
tion to Dutchland. He wanted to bring his violoncello with him, but
this was objected to by the entire party. There were still a few pre-
liminaries to be settled. As to expenses, that is a matter generally
ignored as " mere detail" on Boompje principles.
"Hallo!" says Gooch. " Who talks Dutch r" He generally pre-
faces a question or an observation with " Hallo."
It was explained to him, by the Secretary, that Hollanders generally
talked Dutch.
"No, no," says he; "look here, you fellars" (another formula with
him), I mean which of you talks it. I don't."
No one did. Maullie thought it wasn't necessary. The Secretary
thought it was; but suggested that French would do, to a certain
extent.
Bund asked if he was Commander-in-Chief or not P Yes, he was.
"Very well, theu," says he, " we 'U have a Courier."
It was carelessly objected that this course might be expensive.
It was statistically proved by Bund that it couldn't be anything of
the sort. His auswer was, simply, "No, not a bit of it."
It was mildly opposed by the Secretary; while Gooch, whose pro-
clivities are swellish, but whose means are limited, halted between two
opinions. Boompje, however, prevailed.
Maullii said that he'd once travelled with a Courier, and the plan
was delightfully luxurious. He had just sold his picture, as I have
already hinted, for a sum which would have purchased a wilderness of
Couriers. (Boompje adaptation of Shylock.)
Bund offers to be Paymaster-Geueral, and settle with everyone at
the end of the time.
The Secretary and Gooch immediately agree to this plan, foreseeing
the convenience of a distant settlement, and place themselves entirely
in Bond's hands.
Maullie yields, on condition that he is to map out what we ought
to see.
Bund knows a Courier, and the thin; is done.
Our reasons for going to Holland may be individually stated thus:—
Bund goes because he's seen the picture galleries once, and for-
gotten all about them.
Maullie, because he knows all the pictures by heart, but has never
seen them.
Gooch, because he has never heard of or seen the pictures.
The Secretary, beoause he has never seen the pictures, but heard of
some of them vaguely.
The Courier, because he's taken.
Coincidence which I notice at Rotterdam after the Boompje title
has been adopted, viz., that our Courier's name is Jomp, pronounced
Jump; and, therefore,the very name for a leader and guide of the
Booiupjes.
Ou »e go to Holland, via France and Belgium; and back again, via
Belgium and France. Boompje!
"Yes," cries Gooch, as we were carrying it off jauntily on the quays
of Rotterdam, with hearts both light and merry (with which hey
down derry" is to rhyme in The Miller and his Men, vide opening
Chorus), "here we are regularly out on the spree."
"No," returns Propessor. Maullie, sweetly rebuking his junior,
"do not say 1 on the spree;' say that we are out on the Boompje."
START OF THE BOOUPJES—LILLE—GHENT—THE BOOMPJE
HATS.
Maullie is to meet us at Antwerp, which we are to pass through on
our road to Rotterdam, but where we do not wish to stop, as three
of the party "know it by heart." Maullie being of an independent
Boompje nature, sets off by himself.
From the moment of our concluding arrangements with Jomp, the
Courier, all trouble is supposed to be Uken off our hands. We merely
tell Jomp where we waut to go to, Jomp knows the place, of course,
intimately, and he could find the way there blindfold. So Jomp
arranges our route. We propose, Jomp disposes. Jomp gets all the
necessary tickets, and we are to be oblivious of everything until we
find ourselves at our first halting place, Ghent.
The only inconvenience about this plan, we find, is that we chauge
our minds, and Jomp doesn't. We decide that we ought to go via
Antwerp first. Then having deeded that, we decide again that
Antwerp oughtn't to be taken at all, but begin with Bruges.
Gooch exclaims, "Look, here! I say! Why not stop at Lille for a
nightP"
No one knows exactly why not, but it being discovered that there's
nothing to be doue at Lille at night, " except go to bed, that's all,"
says Jomp. disparagingly,the proposal is dismissed as unworthy of notice,
and GooCH says, Hang it: he thinks you might listen to some of his
suggestions." As this looks like breaking up the party before it starts,
we compromise by calling in Jomp (which would have saved us con-
siderable trouble at first, as we now find he has taken all the tickets
via his own route) and asking him if we go near Lille.
Jomp, when questioned, always gives one the idea of having been
called out of bed at short notice, ana dressed himself in a hurry. He
collects his scattered senses by passing his hand forwards and backwards
over his head several times, and murmuring something, partially uniu-
tellisrible, still in his character of a man not quite awake.
"Lille," he is understood to murmur vaguely, "veil—um—um."
It should be mentioned that Jomp is, it is supposed, of Swiss origin,
and possesses such a knowledge of languages as is enough to reuder
him generally unintelligible in any particular tongue.
"Lille," he replies, considering, "Lille—veil—um-um-um! Oh
yes!"—this he gives in the tone of a permission—" Oh yes, you can go
by Lille," wherewith he shrugs his shoulders, as if to give us to under-
stand that such a ditour will put the train to considerable trouble, not
to mention the entire derangement of his own plans.
"Yes." But Bond puts it in a barrister-like style. "Do we go
there or do we not?"
"Veil," says Mr. Jomp, after polishing his head slowly, preparatory
to taking his cap in both hands, and holding it behind him, " Veil—
you can go by Lille—oh yes—de train pass true dere." Then he a,lds
suddenly, as an afterthought, which is to take us by surprise, " If you
go that vay."
It is finally decided that we won't stop at Lille. And the route is
mapped out to the satisfaction of all parties.
Bund says confidentially to the Secretary, that he should like to
have got down to Milan, or spent the time in Switzerland, instead of
Holland.
Maullie takes an early opportunity (when we subsequently come
up with him at Antwerp) of informing me that he g-ives way to the
majority, but for his part he should like to have made Dort his chief
place, and stopped there. Maullie's one idea is to go to Dort. Bund,
who is always ready with an argument from Murray, points out lint
his authority says, " There is nothing to detain the traveller at Dort."
Maullie says that it is only true after you've seen everything. He
is sure that Dort is the most interesting place in Holland. Jomp sa>s,
"Oh yes, um—um—um, you can stop at Dortrecht—um—um." Theu,
as an afterthought, "if de steamer go dere." On the whole, we keep
Dort in reserve for Maullie, if he won't go on without it. First
Boompje sonnet by Maullie :—
To judge by report,
I always thought
That we ought
To stop at Dort.
Bund thinks it stupid! Gooch says that port doesn't rhyme to
ought; and Maullie likes it himself, and reads it to me privately.
Gooch hopes [before we start] that we shall push on to Brussels
and "see some fun." No one knows exactly what he means, except,
apparently Jomp, who says, "Oh, jes—um—um, you can do someiing
ht Brussels," which is the fullest information he can offer us on the
subject.
We start.
A broiling hot day. Goocu thinks that there won't be a ripple on
the water in crossing.
Bund is of opinion, having had something to do with nautical affairs
in his time, that it may be " blowing freshish outside." The men-
tion of "outside" exercises au uupleasant influence over Goocu.
He stations himself as near the centre as possible, and won't rise from
his seat
Mr Jomp, with admirable forethought, places the coats and bigs
on our seats, which he secures for us several minutes before the boat
starts, iu such a position that we get the sun in our eyes, the hlacks
from the chimney, and the heavy moisture from the steam valve pipe.
On being remonstrated with by Bund, who points out to him (Bund
once had a thirty-ton yacht off Brith, which he thought resembled the
French coast without the nuisance of having to learn a foreign
language) that when the wind is SS. by EE., and the sun is at meridian,
also when a boat is steering from SB by N W. then, if you want to keep
out of the sun, you must get into the shade, Jomp replies, with an
admirable readiness, which shows him equal to any emergency.
"Veil, yes—um-um-you can move the things."
Gooch, finding that there is no chance of being inconvenienced by
the voyage, now becomes hilarious, and ventures upon pale ale and a
cigar. He regales us with anecdotes of himself in various towns of
Europe, chiefly Boulogne and Paris. He begins to air his French, and
points out two or three people on board who he assures us, on his own
experience, are "regular foreigners," and who turn out to be com-
mercial travellers from Liverpool. Boompje!
At Calais be rejoices in being on the shores of France once more—
la belle France he exclaims—as if he'd been born or brought up there.
He exhibits the soldiers, the douanien, and the French people to us
generally with this preface, "Look here, you won't see this sort of
thing in England, you know. We can't do that," a summing up
generally in depreciation of his own country.

MUSCULAR CHKISTUN EXERCISE.
At the Summer Meeting of the London Ama-
teur Athletic Club, held last Saturday at the
Little-bridge Grounds, West Bromptnn, heading
the list of sports which then came off, there took
place a pedestrian contest of a somewhat re-
markable denomination, namely, a " Race by
Novices." This may be imagined to have been
sn interesting combination of athleticism and
asceticism. On that supposition it must he
supposed to have taken place ptrmi'su supe-
riorum; and credit will accordingly be given to
the superiors for their liberality and disposition
to meet the times. But, on further perusal,
finding that " the first heat resulted in favour of
Pekcy Spurlixg/' the reader lias probably dis-
cerned that the Race by Novices was at any
rate not a foot-race between young ladies in
their novitiate; which deprives it in a measure
of the interest it would otherwise have possessed.

Sport and Game.
There is somet hing in the argument that, as
pheasants and other game have come to be bred
and fed like domestic poultry and live stuck,
i hey should now by statute be declared to have
ceased to be ferae natuni, and to have become
property. To abate the prejudice which objects
to this proposal, perhaps, as the slaughter of
tame animals is no sport, the landed poulterers
will discontinue shooting.

ia the hottest climates. Trea-
sure it, preserve it, pickle it,
but call no man happy who
goes to rest with a single bill
unpaid."
How sublime, is this thought
of Goethe's !" The Ocean of
Existence has never yet been
hydrographed, and its deepest
secrets are past dredging for.
We gather a fewfender tinted shells, a few tufts of bright weed, and
sup off costly molluscs; but the Sea and We are still Strangers, we
and the Sea make no progress, and Life sinks behind the horizon before
the Bud of Acquaintance has burst into the Bloom of Friendship.
Walk by the Margin, and listen to the Waters moaning their strange
Secret to the sympathising Stars, and take another cigar before you
turn in."
Milton well knew that the experience of all middle-aged men would
amply corroborate this chain of corollaries:—
"Never exceed your income.
"Never exceed the bounds of decorum.
"Always brush your hat when you take it off.
"Be careful how you interfere with another man's fire.
"Do not sit in damp clothes.
"Study the polity of the State, and be at your post, although of
the meanest order, when the walls of the Republic are
threatened.
'' The true Citizen never omits to have his boots properly blacked
every morning."
How thoroughly that wise old heathen, Efaulnondas, knew the
works of the human heart! Listen to a few of his gems. "Never
lend your horse. Seem, lather than be. Build your garden wall
higher, if your neighbour can look over it. Tread warily, if jour path
is strewn with broken bottles. Be ready to do small kindnesses—always
have postage stamps in your pocket, and Metropolitan time-tables, and
the finest Eau-de-Cologne that money can procure."
Mark what Lavateh said to William Tell, when they were coming
home in the dawn from a post mortem, over the Bridge of Sighs, and
talking about the Revenpe Heturns. Put a good face on the matter.
If troubles rise, stare them out of countenance. We all wear the same
uniform—only the facing are different. The richest man cannot
escape the toothache, and 'be poorest may enjoy a sunset and a salad.
Be content, and fill up your Income-tax paper with conscientious
fidelity, and you will be scheduled with the suit."
Gulden words these of Bacon's: "The weaknesses of men are often
the strength of states, and the favourites of princes have before now
become the shuttlecocks of vengeful Fortune. Some men are born and
others die; but none can escape either the one day or the other.
Between the beginning and the end there lie many intercalated
Stations, where we may rest and recreate, and gather strength for
the ventures that Fortune hath yet in her wallet. Blind as she is,
she sometimes drops the bandage and catches the Spraker's eye; but
her myrmidons are a host, and her followers a great army, and to be
victorious over Fortune your weapons must be keen, well-tempered,
and bright, your arms strong and resolute, your courage dauntless,
your endurance martyr-like,and your wife's relations unexceptionable.
CRITICISM AND KINDNESS.
Nought of the dead but good. Forbearance kind.
Disparagement can hurt them now no more,
Injure in credit, or affect in mind;
Praise after death him you traduced before.
Sprinkle his grave with flowers of purple hue;
For 'tis an office to perform inane.
Throw roses for the dirt you sometime threw.
No longer they can please, or it give pain.
Him, whomsoe'er defunct, extol; be sure
No better for your praises he can be.
Assail the living, those who yet endure,
And may be harmed, or vexed, by obloquy.

CONSTANT CLERICAL DISABILITIES.
ou must see that there are
clerical disabilities which
neither the Bill now before
Parliament nor, perhaps, any
other that may become law,
will ever remove. No Cle-
rical Emancipation Act that
can possibly be passed will
enable a curate in a rural
district to wear a bird's-eye
neck-tie, or, in some parishes,
where old women abound,
any other than a white one.
The disability to dance is
one to which a clergyman
will generally be subject
under such penalty as bis.
anile parishioners may have
it in their power to inflict
upon him, either iu a social
or pecuniary way. So is
the disability to play any
same at cards, from un-
limited loo to a round game
of " speculation" at Christ-
mas, Disability to hunt
and shoot, notwithstanding
legislation, will remain imposed on every Minister of the Church of
England who does not happen to be in independent circumstances.

SEWAGE-FARMING IN BOTH SORTS.
"Thr Chichester Trainino-Shtp.—Once a year, in commemoration of
the establishment of a nautical refuge for destitute boya picked up in the
streets of London, a meeting is held on board the Cltiehester, lying off Green-
kithe. During the three years that have elapsed from the establishment of
the home up to December, 1869, no fewer than 546 boys have been admitted
on board; and of these, after a training of upwards of two years, 350 have
gone to sea as sailors, or taken other situations. . . A party of about 250
of the friends and supporters of the training-ship went down in the Petre1.
yesterday. , . Early in the afternoon the Earl of Shaftesrury arrived
accompanied by Lady Victoria Ashley, Mr. J. M'Uregor, and others, and
was received by the Committee, and Caft. Thureurn, Commander of the
Ship. Bis Lordship having taken the chair, the boys were put through
several of their sailors' duties, such as furling and reefing sails, all of which
were performed with cheerful alacrity and seaman-like promptitude. To
encourage deserving boys, the system of the Royal Navy is adopted of con-
ferring good conduct badges and stripes, and appointing a cert tin number as
leading hands and corporal", with some privileges. . . At the meeting
yesterday, the prizes were presented to the successful boys by Lady Victoria
Ashley.''—Daily Telegraph, June 30<A.
"Sswaoe Croph.—The local authorities of Blackburn, in Yorkshire, and
Reading, in Berkshire, are endeavouring to obtain Parliamentary powers for
utilising their sewage by irrigation. Yesterday a practical proof was
afforded to the Private Bill Committee, in the Reading case, of the agri-
cultural value of the process. On Mr. W. Hope being called as a witness
iu support of the bill, that gentleman produced a number of samples of
crops reared by the application of town sewage. From the Lodge Farm, at
Harking, fertilised by the sewage of the metropolis, came a fine specimen of
wheat, the stalks about five feet high, and with ears of great length, the whole
characterised by a healthy and vigorous green colour. The wheat in question
was slated to bo the last in a series of four successive crops of the same cereal.
A quantity of very fine strawberries also made their appearance. From the
Lodge Farm there came a large and fruitful currant-bush, which gave to the
committee-room a singularly rural aspect. This bufh was said to be a fair sample
of hundreds growing at the same spot. In addition were specimens of fruits
and flowers from Breton's Farm, fertilised with the sewage of Romford.
The fragrance of a splendid bouquet of roses seemed to be much appreciated by
Loud Liffokd and his colleagues; and interest was excited by the display of
sewage-grown Irttuos, carrots, spinach, peas, and Italian rye-grass.'—
Standard, June 3'Jth.
Of all the truths that Palmerston in his long life-time spoke,
And they were many and grave ones ton, for all their jaunty cloak,
He never spoke a truth it more concerns John Boll to face,
Than when he once defined * us "dirt" as "matter out of place."
I There 'a dirt of many sorts about, as we all know too well,
by witness both of soul and sense, of sight and touch aud smell.
• Lord Palmsrston was not the real author of this definition, though it'
owes its currency to his having first given it circulation by adoption into one
of his speeches. The real authorship of the definition belongs to Mr. F. 0.
Wakd, the author of another sayiDg hardly less pregnant—" The rainfall to
the river: the sewage to the soil." i
We cannot look into ourselves but Lamr's joke seems apropos,
"If dirt were trumps, what splendid hands too many of us could
show!"
There's the dirt of dirty money, that sticks to hands and hearts:
There's the dirt of dirty dealings, that infects our shops and marts:
There's the dirt of dirty labour, that darkens the light of day;
There 's the dirt of dirty pleasure, that poisons our rare play:
With the dirt of uncared-for bodies we sap life's strength and spring j
The dirt of uncared-for dwellings we as plague-seed broadcast fling;
With the dirt of speech, God's birthday gift to the first create of
men,
We foul the waters of knowledge and life, by dint of tongue and pen.
There is human dirt as there's household dirt—a dirt that eats and
breathes,
A life that festers in our streets, as the filth in our sewers seethes:
Refuse, still swept by the besom of the Foroe, with its " Come, move
on!"
To the hideous human dust-hole, where too much, ere this, has gone.
Some of this dirt, in mercy to it and to ourtehes.
We dispose of, small and early, where the baby-farmer delves:
8owing the small starved corpses, laud'num-sodden'd, here and there,
Under railway-arches—in rubbish-heaps—just out of the gaslight's
glare.
But baby-farmers are few, and the life iu human dirt is tough,
And in spite of cold and hunger and kicks street-Arab grows into
rough:
And human dirt accumulates—dirt-babes born to dirt-wives—
Till it swells our rates and cumbers our gaols, and perplexes us out of
our lives.
And all the while this human dirt's but " matter out of place "—
The matter of immortal souls, reduced to this evil case I
The life that should flow through England's veins, for strength of work
and play,
Left in fever-slums to fester, or iu plague-streams soak away.
So closely holds the parallel 'twixt dirt in matter and man—
'Twixt the foul contents of the scavenger's cart, and the load of the
prison-van—
That 'tis as true of the streets above as of the sewers below,
Two streams of precious matter, misplaced, to waste are let to flow:
Then bless the strong stomachs and kindly hearts aud far-seeing heads
of those
That from either foul and festering stream have not stopped or turned
the nose;
But have said to the misplaced matter, "Thy right place take again,"
Do good work and breed blessing, not waste and plague, for men.
God bless our sewage-farmers, be it dirt of man or mire
They take to turn from filth to food, from ill to good desire;
Whether unto the fields they give what from the fields was ta'en,
Or in what once showed God's image bring God's image out again.
Whether they turn to yellow corn, green rye-grass, juicy root,
Or vegetable succulent, or luscious-berried fruit,
The sewage that pollutes our streams, or festers at our gates,
For the fattening of fevers and the ripening of rates—
Or culture into self-respect and train to useful toil
The pestilent Street-Arab that lived by sin aud spoil;
That knew of Law nought but its gripe, of Justice but her sword;
Whose good was ill, whose right was wrong, Hell a jest, and God a
word.
Yes, God bless our sewage-farmers, I say and say again—
Bless their tillage—be't of cereal, or be't of human grain!
For their every seed there's a blessing the more, and a curse the less,
under the sun:
Each new-tilled span of Geld or man to God's use is re-won.
Croquet and Chivalry.
The Croquet Tournament at Wimbledon did of course not want a
Queen of Beauty, nor did that Sovereign lack subjects of the most
resplendent charms, but what sort of knights were the gallants who
figured in the lists P Accustomed to distinguish themselves principally
on the field which is carpeted with turf, doughty as the champions ol
Croquet may be, they must, for all their prowess, be regarded as carpet
knights.

DICTA FOR DANCING.
(Lectures on.the Gay Science. By Tobaccolaureus Artium.)
he season is far advanced, and
ladies are bewailing; the pre-
sence of" Wallflowers," who
are neither useful nor orna-
mental, but simply crowd
the staircases, the conser-
vatories, and the landings,
getting in everyone's way,
and by their inopportune
appearance, preventing the
blossoming of many a se-
rious flirtation, and nipping
in t he bud theprojects of far-
sighted mammas, and the
hopes of eldest daughters.
With eyes moistened by
iced champagne cup, Mr.
Punch's Tobaccolaureus
Artium, having given his
earnest consideration to the
case, has arrived at the con-
clusion, viz., that the Art of
Dancing is being neglected j
that there arc several old
acquaintances which would
bear revival, and several
foreign dances which would
tend to promote hilarity and
good humour, and would
drag the aforesaid Wall-
flowers from their seclusion
and repose. The Tobacco-
laureus Artium proposes
(it is for Professors, according to University announcements, always
"to propose "—let the proverb be finished by whoever cares to do it)
to hold classes in his L.fc'.T. (Light Fantastic Toe) School, but for the
benefit of those who cannot at present, or will not just now attend, he
further proposes to publish a few hints (the mere sketches of his oral
teaching) for the Ball Room, which he at once commences.
1. On the End and Aim of all Dancing.
Dancing is the Poetry of Motion. Considering how often a motion
is before the House of Commons, it is surprising what opportunities it
has lost, of converting the most prosaic, into the most poetical pro-
ceeding. If every Honourable Member danced when he had to
"move," what marvellous steps the House might take towards the
despatch of business!
"The Art of Dancing is one whereby the feelings are expressed."—
How true this is everyone who has seen, or joined in, a waltz, must
immediately acknowledge. Rage, Jealousy, Love, Respect, all are to
be gathered, by the observer, from the manner in which the trois temps,
or deux temps, is performed.
One object in these hints will be an attempt to revivify the polkr.
Wallflowers have forgotten this as well as other figures; thinking, in
fact, very little of any figures except their own.
With the ancient Greeks and Romans, dancing was a part of their reli-
gious rites. So it is now in England; the high-priestesses are the Match-
making Mothers. Regardless of their doom, the little victims dance.
Dancing contributes to the preservation of health, and is apparent
from the absolute necessity entailed upon every Paterfamilias, with sons
and daughters, of rushing off to the seaside, or to some watering-place
on the Continent, where the young people appear with the glow of
health on their cheeks, the sparkle of life in their eyes, and exhibit a
strength of limb, which will overcome mountains. In these you behold
the votaries of the Dance, the most constant worshippers, the Fast
Partners, who have done three parties a-night since the commence-
ment of the season, and, Saturday evenings excepted, have never been
in bed for nearly three months, before five in the morning.
Dancing is conducive to the formation of manners, as we shall pro-
ceed to show, by giving a few rules for conduct in the ball-room.
Finally, great and illustrious men in all azes, have danced. Socrates
danced; Plato danced; Xenophoh invariably danced while writing bis
Anabasis.
Henri Quater of France nobly said, in answer to one of his
bishops, that '' he danced because he liked it;" a reply that appears at
the time to have given considerable satisfaction to his subjects. (' rs.ui
Augustus invented the ballet, and Nero is too vulgar an instance for
us to quote here. In old days, as the Poet sings, They—
Made for Terpsichore
Temples of hickory,
Practised no trickery,
Drank all the chicory.
Long may she reign!
Which shows, if nothing else did, or would, how blameless and simple
were the followers of the goddess, and also the nature of their libations
in her honour.
But antiquarianism must not detain us; though the substance of the
above will serve admirably for conversations between partners during
quadrilles, when such topics as the weather, the Park, and the Opera,
llave been exhausted.
2. The Quadrille Reformed.
Let us have steps, not a languid and slouching walk. If, as has been
said above. Dancing is a language for the feelings, let us point our toes
as we would our remarks. Number one is Le Pantalon.
Simple Rules.—Set and turn to Partners; cross over by yourself;
chassez right and left. Stop to see where you've got to. If the
quadrille has finished, return to your partner and apologise. If not, join
her, and express your sentiments in a lively (or otherwise) measure.
L'Eli.—First lady advances and retires; then retires and advances.
If your memory faus you during this quadrille, always return to your
partner, balancez, and insist on taking his hand and going round with
him. Or (if a gentleman) with her. In dancing an unknown or un-
certain figure, the strong determined will comes off best.
Grand Rule for all Occasions.—When in doubt, balancez.
La Poule.— Cross over on the first opportunity, and get back again
on the first opportunity after that. Thank heaven for your safety so
far. Take bold of somebody and chassez: apologise, if wrong.
La Trinise.—Ladies' chain. Set to some one; your partner, if pos-
sible. Advance twice, with or without partner. _ Change sides.
Glissade, chassez, and turn partners inwards. (This is usually called
the Colwell-Hatchney Figure.)
La Pastorale and La Finale is chiefly advancing and retiring ad
libitum, and galopading about with your partner. Be always ready to
start galopading, and say, Now then, come along!" A shout adds to
the real excitement. But better perhaps leave this until after supper.
N.B. Figures in themselves are of small importance to the true
dancer; steps are everything. Genius invents figures as it goes on, and
steps too.
The Royal Wales Quadrille, or Princes Fancy, as danced at all
the Court Balls.
Top couple advance, retire, and turn inwards.
Four ladies join right hands in centre, and
Swing gentlemen into places.
All chassez across, in the form of a star, and
Return to places.
3. Etiquette.
Tou may galopade with a lady all about the room without being in-
troduced to her, and you will not be thought guilty of presumption in
so doing. When you've finished with her, put her down somewhere.
You are not bound to ask her name and address, nor need you take
any further notice of her.
SPEED THE "DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEM."
Chorus of Ratepayers.
Forward, each Denomination,
In the cause of Education,
To the rescue from the State,
That you may indoctrinate
Your own poor with your own views,
Thus you '11 no adherents lose.
To this end there's but one way,
For your own schools 'tis to pay,
Do it with no sparing hand.
That they may o'erspread the land,
Happy we if it befall
That you school, between you, all.
France in a Frenzy.
What if Priuce Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Catholic
Hohenzollern, were to become King op Spain f As a constitutional
Sovereign, what power would he have, even had he the will, to help
the Protestant King op Prussia to subjugate France P The French
have the reputation of being dainty. Their Emperor has a taste; so,
doubtless, has Ollivier, so has the Due de Gramont; and they may
have cause to be offended with the great Teutonic sausage, but must be
over fastidious indeed to object so violently as they do to a mild
"Small German."

RAINFALL AND REASON.
A French Chemist, arguing from the fact that great
battles have coincided with iieavy showers, has proposed
that, in order to terminate a drought, the attempt should
be made to shake rain out of the clouds by a general can-
nonade. This, with the view, apparently, of getting the
popular mind of France to entertain the idea of it, he
suggests, might be associated with some religious celebra-
tion. We should like to know what Faraday would have
said to this twofold proposal, which, if it were practised,
and found to answer, might rather mislead the faithful but
unscientific multitude P A French philosopher might not
mind doing that, but a true English one would. We would
dissociate the theological from the scientific experiment for
the deduction of rain. Invoke St. Swithin on St. Swithin's
day if you like, but try your cannonade on some day before
or after.
THOUGHTS OF GREAT MEN.
(Note first collected.)
What can be more magnificent than this apostrophe to "Time " by
Thomson P
"0, Time! thou greatest autocrat of all
Who reign o'er millions and o'er millionnaires,
Despotic sovran of a drooping world,
Wrinkled and worn, and faded as a robe
Blanched hueleas by the Sun's solstitial ray—
Deal gently with this young connubial pair,
Launched gaily on Life's tossing sea to-day,
And now en route for Folkestone and Boulogne:
Drop scythe and glass, and bid thy visage wear
A cheerful smile, as in those jocund days,
When in the morning of the buxom world
All things were bright, and fresh, and gay, and cheap,
And universal credit reigned."
The almost crystalline clearness of the following profound reflection
of Kant's cannot fail to be at once appreciated: We are not what
we seem. We are something else, and yet the identical. Our entity
wavers, but our being remains immutable. Essence is in permanence,
accidents vacillate. Various in invariableness, with many phases, but
of one unyielding type, we are not to-morrow as we were the day
before yesterday, and a fortnight hence we shall be on our way to
Newhaven."
No other author, ancient or modern, could bring the pleasing scene
which Addison describes, before our very eves with equal vividness
and fidelity to Nature. He says: "I walked by the side of a stately
river, renowned in commerce, in history, in tuneful song. The evening
was tranquilly beautiful; the sun was departing in regal glory; the
crescent moon rose in the amber sky. The sound of plashing i
merry voices mingled with the nightingale's plaintive trill and the
pensive chime of distant bells.
"Seated on the bank, sat a youthful pair. Their hands were joined,
her face was turned to his with all the ardour of passionate affection,
with all the purity of maiden innocence. Wishful not to disturb their
happiness, I selected a path which took my steps away from the tuft
of verdure they occupied, when, turning once more to admire the
glowing west, I saw, to my amazement, my sorrow, that her head was
averted, that her hand was no longer clasped in his. That moment a
cloud passed over the face of the moon. Had a cloud so soon over-
shadowed their happiness P My interest in the lovers overcame my
unwillingness to intrude on their retirement. I approached, and heard
a slight but familiar noise. My fears were dispelled, my doubts were
at an end. She had turned away her face, and withdrawn her hand—
to sneeze!"
A Warning to Waiters.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [J^r 16, 1870.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
mportant! Monday,
July 4th. Posterity,
observe! This week
is note-worthy, by
reason that in it
broke on Europe the
news that Prim of
Spain had selected
Leopold of Hohen-
zollern - Sigmaringen
elevation of a Prus-
sian Prince to the
Peninsular throne.
Europe believes that
if the King op Prus-
sia supports or per-
mits the selection,
there will be another
"War of the Spanish
Succession." As the
war at present known
by that name cost
to'/ /" ^-^tt^JT* \ V England at least
* ▼ \ \ ^ £62,000,000 Get us
**'" put it into words
also, for the better
appreciation of the amount—Sixty-Two Millions of Pounds Sterling),
it may be hoped that if the apprehended conflict take place, England
will manage to keep out of it, the rather that it matters not at all to
her who reigns in Spain. There must be some Parliamentary utter-
ances on this subject—perhaps there may be a legion—so here the
Public has the case stated once for all.
To-day the Lords spoke on the Bill for making illegal the sale of the
next presentation to a benefice, and of certain advowsons. Up came,
of course, the irrepressible Rights of Property, and the Bill was read a
Second Time, only on condition of its being sent to a Select Committee.
Lord Salisrury thought that if purchase in the Church were
abolished, we should have to abolish purchase in the Army. - May be
so; but buying the right to be killed, and buying the right to preach
religion are surely as distinct things as can well co-exist.
The Bill for sequestering the benefices of parsons who do not pay
their debts, was passed by the Lords—who always pay theirs. By the
way, it has just been finally decided that a Peer may be a bankrupt.
Imagine a Lord walking in procession with his certificate in his coronet!
Clearly, these be no feudal times.
Married Women's Property Bill is sent to a Committee, and Mr.
Punch relies upon that noble body to make the excellent Bill excel-
lenter, but by no means to impair its value to those who now suffer
most unjustly for want of protection. The Lords can stick up stoutly
for Rights of Property, as has been seen. Here is an opportunity for
doing so in the most righteous way.
Note, if you please, that Lord Granville is the new Foreign
Secretary, that Lord Kimrerlet is the new Colonial Secretary, that
Lord Halifax (olim Sir Charles Wood) is the new Lord Privy Seal,
that Mr. Forsier enters the Cabinet (the Commons cheered him, ana
Mr. Punch echoes the cheer), and that Mr. Trevelyan, ceasing to be
Admiralty Lord because he disapproves of a portion of the Education
Bill, is succeeded by Lord Camperdown, Lord-in-Waiting, who was
1st Class in Classics at Balliol, and is descended from our glorious old
Admiral, Viscount Duncan, who nobly put into the family arms the
figure of the Sunderland sailor, Crawford, who, at the battle of Cam-
perdown, did seven times, amid a storm of shot, nail his Admiral's flag
to the mainmast of the Venerable. Here be three "who's" in six lines,
but it is too hot to recast sentences.
Census next year, Ladies. In Ireland it is to be Religious; that is,
the professed faith of everybody is to be stated. So, in Scotland. But
in England it is to be Irreligious. The reason of this is, that when a
person does not describe himself as belonging to any particular sect,
be is claimed by the Church of England, and sundry who arc not her
friends desire not that she should be thus aggrandised.
Mr. J. B. Smith. Will the Post-Master-General now adopt the
French Gram P
Lord Hariington. He won't.
A good talk about Counts Out. There have been many of late, and
divers Members wax wrathful. But there is to be no surrender of the
right of the House to be relieved altogether of speeches which are not
worth the attention of forty Members. Mr. Disraeli very properly
suggested that there should be no sharp, snatching practice, but that a
gentleman's instinct should guide the mover of a count.
University Tests Bill went through Committee, and next day was
read a Third Time by 247 to 113, and passed—the House of Commons.
Never do you, pensive Public, pass a typographical hint by Mr. Punch.
Observe that dash. "There s toys abroad, he'1l tell thee more anon."
Tuesday. Very materially indeed did the Lords modify their treatment
of the Irish Land Bill. Specially, by 130 to 33 votes, was restored the
old form of the Bill in regard to the amount of rent that is to entitle a
tenant to compensation. It again rests at £100, to secure the approval
of the "leaders of the Irish tenantry." Some alterations by the
Ministers were accepted by the Conservatives, and on the concluding
night of debate the Bill was read a Third Time, Lord Leitrim alone
shouting forth his discontent.
Catholic friends at a distance and near will please accept this inti-
mation. The Ecclesiastical Titles Act has ceased to be. Let's have a
fete at the Crystal Palace, with a firework picture of S. Peter's, and
His Holiness smilingly accepting compensation presented by Britannia P
In two years the Thames Embankment from Chelsea to B&ttersea
will be finished, said Sir William Tite. The eminent architect
added, that though we can't afford granite, we shall use a stone called
millstone grit, and thus have a beautiful and elaborate stone wall
instead of brick. Dear Mr. Ayrton, but that you are going away—
(you must go away)—and, therefore, you need counsel no longer, Punch
would ask you, Why can't you answer an aisthetic question as Sir
William Tite does P You can't think how easy and pleasant civility
is when you once get into the habit of using it P
Mr. Lamrert advised Mr. Lowe to pay the National Debt. Mr.
Lowe said the suggestion was rather a good one, and he would see
what he could do. Sir John Luerock (whose opinion on this and
everything else is very valuable) did not think that the way Mr. Lowe
proposed to go to work was the right way.
An interesting debate on the running down the American Oneida
by the English Bombay, and on the conduct of Mr. Eyre, the captain
of the latter. In brief, it may be said that he was acquitted of inhu-
manity in not having remained to cruise about for the injured vessel,
but was considered to have been in error. Sir J. Elphinstone said
that if the Oneida had not been a "Yankee," we should not have
heard a syllable about it. Mr. Gladstone adroitly availed himself
of the word (only a corruption of the Indian corruption of " English,")
to censure the feeling of the gallant sailor. Sir J. E. disclaimed dis-
respect for the Americans, whom he looked upon as " our right-hand
men." Mr. Punch takes leave to go further, and to say that because
the vessel was Yankee, it was fitting that excess, rather than deficiency,
in attention should be shown, for the reason that blood is thicker than
water; and that the Americans, though they quarrel with us as only
relations quarrel with relations, are our own flesh and blood after all;
and so three cheers for the little Mayflower and the Pilgrim Fathers;
and now let's liquor up. Brandy and soda, as suggested above, by our
artistic young man.
May Punch note that to-day the Earl of Derey was wedded to the
Dowager Countess of Salisrury P Both names are so Parlia-
mentarian that he has admirable excuse for here tendering his choicest
felicitations. Besides—he does as he likes.
Wednesday. A Bill by Mr. Brown for doing away the Poaching
Act of 1862. There was some diverting talk, as there always must be
when pheasants are put up in an assembly so devoted to their preserva-
tion and slaughter. The Act was said to have worked well, and to
have broken up many gangs of professional game-thieves, and its abo-
lition was refused, by 140 to C2.
Mr. Thomas Hughes (another Mr. Brown—ha! ha!" how blest
are we that are not simple men! ") brought in his Sunday Trading Bill
for Second Reading, and carried it by 109 to 64. Mr. Rylands
quoted with approval Lord Melrourne's famous question whenever
it was proposed that anything should be done— Can't you* let it
alone P But Mr. Bruce thought that this was not one of the to-be-
let-alone matters.
Just let this be understood, you Educated, by any Uneducated whom
you may hear saying as how they heerd as Parliament is coin' agin
waxination. Mr. Bruce. Home Secretary, fully and resolutely ad-
hering to the principle of Compulsory Vaccination, gives a Committee
to consider how that can be best enforced with due regard to the
wishes of the people. As for any so-called Educated person, quack or
not, who opposes the system, sensible folks are hereby requested and
authorised not to argue with him, but to call him a Fool. He may
strike, in return. It is to be hoped that he will. Then remember the
Conversion of Colonel Quagg. It is inimitably told by Mr. Sala;
but you may imitate the process he describes.
Mr. D. Dalrymple brought in a Bill to provide for dealing with
folks who " habitually" take more liquor than is good for them. We
notice this at an early stage, as it may have interest for sundry persons
known and unknown to Mr. Punch.
Thursday. The Marquis of Townshind saw good reason to with-
draw a Biff of his for the Protection of Children. But he pointed out
that, as recent Baby-Farming cases had shown, children stood -no, the
poor little things have not even learned to stand—lay in want of pro-
tection. Also, he protested against the brutality of certain school-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

masters, who correct pupils by blows on the head. Mr. Punch is no
sentimentalist, and has often and vigorously applauded the application
of the hardest cat-o'-nine-tails to the back of ruffianism. He may take
leave to say that any schoolmaster who strikes a child on the head
deserves the cat. A parent's fist in the fellow's eye might not, how-
ever, be a bad substitute. In these observations Mr. Punch means no
disrespect to Kino Solomon, who suggests correction, not injury,
as has been well pointed out by Lady Llanover, and by Ma Chere
Mere, in Miss Bremer's delightful story, The Neighbours.
A debate, interesting to clergymen and other church-folks, on the
Bill authorising the use of the new Lectiouary, which is to come into
use on and after Advent Sunday next, Nov. 27, by which time the
Bishops appear to think that, the knowledge of the proposed changes
may have found its way into " rural parishes." Really, dear prelates,
with the telegraphs established all over England (except in idiotic
towns where the people are afraid of their twopenny secrets being
known to the postmaster or postmistress) this is a behind-the-age way
of looking at the matter. Punch will back Mr. Scudamore to instd
the requisite information into every clergyman in the kingdom in one
week.
Lord Shaptesrurt did not like the " Popish " word Lectionary.
But as it is not to be in the Prayer Book, the nation is saved from the
Pope, so far. The Earl objected to any part of the Apocrypha hem*
read in church, though, out of 132 chapters, only 44 are to be retained.
There are noble things—and ignoble, in that singular book, and many of
the former may be read with all advantage. Another question which
the Earl raised was answered by a Bishop; and, perhaps, it may be
wise in Mr. Punch to give the answer in the Prelate's own words.
Lord Shaptesrury complained that a certain chapter, in which the
Sun is described as having stood still, is not to be read. The Bishop
of Gloucester and Bristol explained that the record in question
forms but a small part of a history which is less edifying than terrible.
The Bill was read a Third Time and passed, Reverend Friends.
Education was the topic on several nights in the Commons, and on
Friday. The very qualified Compulsion proposed by Government was
approved by large majorities, Mr, Forster predicting that Compul-
sory Education would soon be adopted. Mr. Gladstone intimated
his hope that at the next sitting the llouse would go on without any
very accurate regard to the time of night. Evidently the Premier
has no fear that
They'd all be nodding, nid, nid, nodding,
They'd all be nodding round the Great School Bill.
But there was no nodding at nine o'clock. Mr. W. H. Smith,
Member for Westminster, asked for an Address to the Queen, begging
Her to prohibit the erection of Public Offices upon that part of the
Victoria Embankment which is between Whitehall Place and Charing
Cross. That land, he ably argued, had been conquered from Father
Thames by the rate-payers of London, and they had a right to their
lawful spoil. Mr. Lowe vigorously contended that these two and a
half acres were the Crown's. Mr. Beresford Hope was against
offices, but thought (as Mr. Punch thinks) that the site would be an ex-
cellent one for the Natural History Museum. Provincial Members
murmured that if London were to be favoured, country places ought to
be. There was a very jolly fight; and, after an elaborate argument by
Mr. Gladstone against the motion, the llouse, shouting and im-
patient, divided, and Mr. Smith beat the Government by 156 to 106.
"So thanks to Smith, and Locke, and Hope,
Should we behold, on yonder slope,
Mammoths and hippopotamusses,
Instead of Swells and scribbling cusses."
AN INCOMPLETE MEMORIAL.
TnE following telegram, dated July 2nd, arrived the other day from
Toronto:—
"To-day is Dominion Day, and the Governor-General has been present at
the unveiling of a memorial statue in honour of the Volunteers who fell while
resisting the Fenian raid."
Ha! This monument is very likely a fine work of art, and suitable,
in its way, for a memorial of the fine fellows who died fighting fili-
busters for their country. But another memorial than a statue is
wanting to attest the manner of their death. Such a memorial might
have been erected in the shape of a permanent structure on which the
Fenian "raiders," as the rascals are called who murdered them, might,
if they had happily been caught, have been suspended; but unfortu-
nately they cheated their victims out of a complete memorial, and also,
by running away, cheated that which would have completed it, namely,
the gallows.

OUK COUNT-OUT AND OUR COLLINS—AND

tative of Boston."— Times'Leader.

Our rein for the rider of hobbies!

nts out" do away, but for which who can say
it the bore's tusks we were tost ou!
r shield from that beast let us hold to, at least —
'i for Tom Collins, of Boston!
Who but he, when some spinner of yarns loose and long,
Has his motion set down on the paper,
Is at hand with extinguisher, swift, short, and strong,
That quenches his rushlight in vapour I
The proser might prose, and the prater might, prate,
Turn his douche of tall talk, at our cost, on,
The hobby-horse rider ride o'er us, elate,
But for Counts " and Tom Collins of Boston!
Calm, serene, scorning storms, he the Spraker informs
He has counted: not forty are present—
See! The bore feels the spear that arrests his career—
To him, and him only, unpleasant!
For the rest, ask the serre of the flowers when hot air
Is let in from a flue, with the frost on:
E'en such, in our grief, is the blessed relief
That we owe to Tom Collins of Boston!
We might all use the right, but most shrink in affright
From bearding the bore in his track;
And some, 'neath the skin, to the bore feeling kin,
Fear he some day the spear might send back.
Thus the worth of a " count"— though all own its amount —
England's wisdom collective were lost on,
But for tongue, eye, and ear, above favour or fear,
Like the Spraker and Collins of Boston.
"Counts out" stint or stay, and, dull day after day,
We were swamped by a wild wordy ocean;
Our business estopped, and our brains worn away,
In the grind of perpetual motion.
Bores gruesome and great the field of debate
Would range, all untamed and uncrost on;
And we'd sigh for the hour, when they sunk in their power,
To the " count" of Tom Collins of Boston I
The plague of small talk while 'tis urgent to balk—
While reins we need hobbies to bridle—
While crotchets all round trip us up as we walk,
Spun from brains that are addled or idle—
So long to "counts out" we'1l hold on, stiff and stout,
As his life-buoy the sailor wave-tost on,
And our "council of forty" will ne'er be without—
Let us hope—a Tom Collins of Boston!
"THE RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE" AT THE
ADELPHI.
"' Put yourself in ris place ' at 7."
Such is Mr. C. Rrade's Adelphi advertisement. Surely it ought
to run—
"'Put yourself in your owtr place' at 7."
Punch suggests the amendment, and begs to second the advice.
It is worth all the money to see Mr. Neville forge a knife for his
lady-love to carve her chicken with, to the musio of the " llarmoniout
Blacksmith."
Thus the public can enjoy at the same time the actor's execution of
the blade, and the orchestra's execution of the "Handel."
To Mr. Punch.
Sir,—I read among the items of news brought by the last Indian
Mail, that " disastrous floods have taken place at Indore." May not
these Indore floods have something to do with our Out-door droughts f
Yours respectfully, Wrather-Foolish.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.
oooh, when on French soil, is
very much annoyed at being
taken for anything else but a
Frenchman. Indeed this is
Gooch's peculiarity every-
where abroad. He has no
desire when in Holland to be
thought a Dutchman, but he
is immensely pleased when
the Dutch waiters address
him as "Moshoo," and flat-
ters himself that there isn't
a trace of the Britannic
Islander in him. In Holland
and Germany he is strong in
his French, even to substi-
tuting it occasionally for
English. But in Belgium he
is more diffident of speech,
excessively polite, and full of
action.
Goocu calls the French
language so "expressive."
His idea is practically illus-
trated by his seldom finish-
ing a sentence, even if he
gets half through it correctly
(which is wonderful), but
attempting to convey the
remainder of his meaning by
a shrug and a look. This
is quite satisfactory to a
foreigner, he says, who un-
derstands as much from this expressive pantomime as he does from the
previous conversation. Bund and the rest assent to this as highly
probable, seeing that, on one occasion, when Gooch returned from
talking with a Frenchman with the intelligence that "he had found
him (the Frenchman) a very pleasant fellow, full of information;" and
that he (Gooch) "had picked up a good many valuable hints in answer
to his questions," we found the French gentleman in a state of utter
bewilderment as to "what language your friend (Gooch) had been
talking, as he (the Frenchman) hadn't understood one single word he'd
been saying,"
Macule is as decidedly English (which Gooch is perpetually de-
ploring) as Gooch is undecidedly French. {Arcades ambo—Boompjes
both.]
Gooch travels as if he were dressed for Regent Street, so as to be
ready, he says, for the towns.
Mauliiz, who has started in advance of us, when he does appear
bursts on us in a light check coat, check trousers, white waistcoat, and
white wideawake. The English tourist complete. Bradshaw in a
bag slung behind him, and a sketch-book and pencil in his off-hand
pocket.
Gooch, not knowing Maullie very well, confides his misery to us in
the evening. "I say, he asks, "can't anyone hide Maullle's wide-
awake and burn his Bradshaw t Or, look here, couldn't we subscribe
and buy him a black hat and black coat for towns? And (imploringly
to us all) do talk French more. Hang it; why shouldn't we all talk
French P And, then, we shouldn't get mixed up with these 'travelling
English' every where." [Boompje.]
On account of that white wideawake and light coat of Maullir's, I
know that Gooch suffered mental agonies.
One morning, Bund, the Commodore, exhibited a black soft felt hat,
of a Tyrolean form, smashed. _ It had braved many tours, and was now
produced by him to save his other hat and be comfortable. Gooch
eyed it, and merely observed that it was impossible for him (Bund)
to go out walking in that thing. Maullie was bad, but to be
excused solely on the ground that he was an artist. But Bund had
no excuse, and his hat was several times worse than Maullir's.
THE TOUE CONTINUES—THE INTELLIGENT JOMP—THE
BOOMPJE LIVEKY.
There is certainly a good deal of Boompje about provincial conti-
nental towns, perhaps not more nor less than in ours. But no matter,
here, there and everywhere all is Boompje.
N.B. The careful and inquiring reader will be able to collect for him-
self, from time to time, such Boompje proverbs as embody most of the
Club's leading principles.
L Once a Boompje always a Boompje.
2. When with Boompjes do as the Boompjes do.
3. Here there and everywhere all is Boompje.
As to Lille and Ghent, this being previous to the Great Boompje
declaration at Rotterdam, suffice it to record the following facts:—
That being interested in the town of Lille, Gooch asks Bund, who
passes it on to the Secretary, if Lille wasn't a very celebrated city.
The Secretary replies, Yes.
Gooch asks what for P
The Secretary passes this back to Bund the Commodore eating ices,
who thinks it was something to do with wars, but he will tell Jomr to
get his Murray out of the fly. Gooch implores him not to: he says
it's so touristy: so English. Ask the waiter.
The waiter doesn't know that Lille is particularly celebrated for
anything: except perhaps the shop where he is, and its ices.
"Fortifications r" suggests Secretary.
"Yes, fortifications," returns the waiter, shrugging his shoulders
depreciatingly.
f'Thread P" asks Bund.
"Yes; it is celebrated too for thread," the waiter thinks.
"Lille thread." Bund turns to us, explaining!
We tell Jomf to let the coachman take us round the town.
We are passing a quaint old house; gabled and carved all over.
"That," says Jomp, cleverly, from the box, "is the Town House."
We ascertain it to be the Hotel de Ville.
We stop before a tremendous cannon, ancient and unwieldy.
Mr. Jomp, on the box, points it out to us, as if there was any pos-
sibility of our not seeing it.
Bund asks him if it's a gas pipe P
Mr. , Jomp being taken aback, and having no invention ready to
hand (it is the business of a Courier to be always ready with some story

"That ?" returns our inexhaustible courier, "um—um—um," he looks
at it and thinks; then to us, as if astonished at our want of perception,
"That is an arc, an arch." With which explanation he expects us to
be as perfectly satisfied as he is himself. We see Vauban's fortifica-
tions being pulled down. We view two churches, which are large and
have fine windows. We don't know their names, but are as much
pleased as if we had heard all about them.
Gooch says, "There! now we've done Lille, let's go back to the

We all feel the better for this episode, and presently, about four
hours after, arrive at Ghent.

"Roas beef, you can have, and mutton, and some plum puddang."
"Confound it!" says Gooch. "What's the good of coming abroad
for that P" And forthwith, the table arrangements having been confided
to him, he orders an elaborate menu.
At dinner Gooch, in his character of un vrai Parisien, insists upon
having hors d'ceuvres. But for these (which turn out to be radishes on
one plate and butter on another) the dinner is served in purely English
style: whereat Gooch is very angry with Jomp, who, he says, has told
them that we are English, and like this sort of thing.

But for a long time he doesn't get over the imputation of having
betrayed the secret of our being Englishmen, and living only on " roas
beef, mutton, and plum-puddang."
We apply to Jomf, as knowing all about it, to know what there is to
be seen in Ghent.
Jomf replies," Veil—um—um, you can see—um—um, a great many
things." We wait to hear a few mentioned particularly. There's
(it suddenly occurs to him by a sudden inspiration,) " vatever you like."
He says this as if Ghent belonged to Mm, and he was throwing it
open gratis for our inspection.
"Ain't there some fine churches P" Bukd suggests as a leading
question to freshen his memory.
"Oh, yez," he returns, shrugging his shoulders; "there's, um—um
—veil—there's churches."
"Hang it!" cries Gooch, "go and ask somebody," and Jomp,
more hurt than ever, in fact, almost shedding tears, quits the room,
and we hear voices on the landing. Jomf and the waiter.
"He said he knew all these places," Bund explains apologetically.

Jomf. the "intelligent officer," as the police reports say of a police-
man who has done nothing but "receive information," returns,
having ascertained that there is a Belfry to see and a
Church of St. Paul. He takes us to the Belfry, and tells us it is St.
Paul's; he takes us to St. Paul's, and tells us it is the Belfry. Both
are shut; but an old man, in his shirt sleeves, offers, instead, to show
us the Gymnasium. Declined, with thanks.

Advice to tur Farmer.—Keep your Weather Eye
open.
DAME WASHTUB ON THE WEATHER.
Drought, drought for nearly three months long, and not a drop of
rain,
Ah drat the drought! though well we know 'tis sinful to complain.
And bavin' bin so fine, 'tis true, and not the slightest doubt,
That not a day have passed but what a body could get out.
The farmers always grumbles, be the weather what it may,
But sartingly we must alow a felure of the hay,
Which therefore butter is so dear, and dearer it will be,
And what with that and butcher's meat, a-lawks-a-daisy me!
But no one, and it only shows how rare is folks that's just,
Have e'er a word to speak for them as feels the drought the wust.
The soap hard water takes to use you'd think past all belief,
There's none as grieves for want of rain like washerwomen's grief.
But still we 're only havin' what old people used to call
In my young days, "a good old English summer," arter all.
Some seasons it is all as wet, may be another year.
The climate altered P Fiddle! To sitch talk I gives no ear.
Saint Swithin is a comin', which if then it rains, they says,
'Twill arterwards rain every day, or night, for forty days.
It never rains but what it pours; that's what they means: that's all.
I don't believe Saint Swithin, for Saint Swithin ain't Saint Paul.
And oh that Zadkiei! he foretold that June was to be cool,
Which therefore he is either an imposture or a fool,
And if so be as how he's wrong when he foretells the weather,
What can his prophecies be wuth P ah, drat it, altogether!
But would Saint Swithin sprinkle, as the savin' is, the apples.
Apart from any mummery and mash in Popish chapels,
It would be a relief now we have bin so long a fryin'.

St. Peter's day has come and gone, but St. Peter's successor has

I that, possibly, he may fail to be. In that event, all rational people will
be rather disappointed. Either the Pope is infallible or he is not. If
he is, the sooner he is acknowledged to be, the better. If he is not,
j still the better it will be the sooner it is declared that he is. For then
he, and bis Council between them, will have stultified both himself and

must either accept it and be off, or else discontinue the profession that
they " hold all Roman doctrine." Either alternative will, at least, be an

A Stram Paving Machine is at work in Paris. We are still in want

"Up with your Christopher!" as Mr.
Puff says in the Critic. Elevate him by all

while you are about it, why not also make
a saint of brave old Captain Cook, and, for

that the learned divinity doctors of Salamanca—

To make a saint out of a heretic may seem
a little startling, but of course Infallibility
cannot err in doing so. Perhaps the miracle
of making an egg stand on its end has been
esteemed a cause sufficient to canonise Saint
Christopher.
BRIGANDAGE FOR BRITONS.

our box-keepers, who make you pay a ransom

our extortionate cabmen, who insult and
bully ladies until they pay a ransom to be
freed from their abuse P How about the
brigands who get up a mock auction, and
pillage the unwary fools who venture to attend
it P How about the sellers-off of the sham
stock of said-to-be absconding bankrupts,
who plunder all the bargain-hunters that
come within their reach P How about the
brigands in cheap drapery establishments,
who lie in wait behind their counters to
pounce upon their customers, who have to
pay a heavy ransom before they can escape P
And how about our organ-grinders, and our
German banditti, who prowl about the
neighbourhood of quiet streets and squares,
and deafen people until they pay a ransom to
have their ears released P Surely, all such
brigands ought to be suppressed as well as

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CITY POET WANTED.
Courteous Mr. Punch,
I daily find three columns of my newspaper made utterly
unreadable by being filled with statements about dealings in the money
market, and the price of stocks and shares, and similar dry details with
no kind of human interest, except to bulls and bears and creatures of
that sort. Now, if for their sake it be needful to impart such informa-
tion, it might surely be conveyed in a manner less prosaic than that
which is adopted. Without the slightest sacrifice of stockbrokers'
slangography, or in any way abandoning the dull stupid business terms
which are so much in civic usage, City news might be recorded in a
gay poetic fashion, and thus be rendered less offensive to persons like
myself who take no particle of interest in it. I subjoin a specimen of
what a City Poet might report, and, in the hope that your contempo-
raries may act upon my hint, I subscribe myself,
Yours humbly,
Apollo Milton Smith.
A CHANT FROM THE CITY.
Would you know the ruling price now
Of each British stock and share P
List to me, and in a trice now
I their value will declare.
Thus may you gain information
How your money to invest;
But beware of speculation,
Which so many hath distrest.
Consols yesterday were flatter,
And at ninety-two were done:
Duller still Reduced, the latter
Reaching barely ninety-one.
Bank Stock too an eighth receded,
And in sympathy with these
A diminution must be heeded
Of a quarter in New Threes.
In Railways scarce deserving mention
Were the chunges that were made:
Brightens first received attention,
Then were flatter by a shade.
Caledonians, be it noted,
Had a brisk and buoyant air:
But Great Easterns must be quoted
As declining one per share.
Of Mining Shares the market's fuller,
So at less cost buy you can;
Firm, however, stood Wheal Buller,
Dull was poor Wheal Mary Ann.
In gas the bearish operators
For a fall achieved their turn,
So beware, ye speculators,
Lest with gas your fingers burn.
Banks were brisk, but Docks were slower,
Telegraphs improved a shade;
Discounts being quoted lower,
Many purchases were made.
Other falls there '11 be, and rises,
So I end as I began,
When you want to snow the prices
In the City, I'm your man!
An Illiberal Old Gentleman.
"Educate the 8treet Boys—1 beg your pardon, the 8treet Arabs—

demanded Mr. Scroggs. "Reading P—they will read the Police Netos
and the Lives qf the Highwaymen. Writing P— they will write Glad-
stone on the shutters, and Bor Lowe on the walls, 'No Popery'
and other street Arabic. Arithmetic P—the Street Arabs will only do
more addition sums on my gate-posts, besides drawing Street Ara-
besques, and scrawling 'Old Scroggs is a fool.'"
Malaprop on the Mersey.
Mrs. Ramsrotham (Mrs. Malaprop's friend) read in a newspaper
that at Liverpool, on the 4th instant, the principal houses of business,
shipping offices, and American ships in port, were adorned with a fine
display of bunting in honour of " Independence Day." In quoting tins
intelligence she stated, that the caravanserai of American Independence
had been celebrated at Liverpool with a prolusion of Buncombe.
THE ALABAMA CASE AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
General Grant's statesmanlike exposition with reference to Cuba,
of the conditions which should determine, or forbid, recognition of bel-
ligerency, ought to estop his countrymen from letting us near any more
of their complaints about our unfriendliness in recognising the Con-
federates as belligerents during the American Civil War. It ought,
but it won't. Our American brothers are as illogical in their way as
we are in ours, which is saying something.
Suppose, when the war between North and South first broke out,
we had done all that Mr. Seward and Mr. Sumner could have
wished P Suppose we had called the war "a rebellion," and the Con-
federates "rebels "P Suppose we had, nevertheless, recognised the
Federal blockade of the Confederate ports P Suppose the Queen had
issued a proclamation forbidding all her subjects to give any assistance
to the Southern traitors in arms against the sovereignty of the United
States P Suppose a new foreign Enlistment Act had been immediately
passed, the Alabama seized, and her builders fined P
What would have been the consequences of sympathy thus partially
demonstrated by our Government towards the North P
In the first place, an immediate row here. Exasperation on the part
of the British Public. Transference of its entire sympathy to the
South. Overthrow of Government. Change of Ministry. Demand
of a party for intervention concurred in by the people at large. Louis
Napoleon's overtures perhaps agreed to. And what then P
Well; France and England too would, perhaps, have been licked
into a cocked hat. But what—and this is especially the point for the
Sewards and Sumnkrs to consider—what would have happened if
the British Government, in its active sympathy with the North, had
been enthusiastically supported by the British nation P What then P
All the American Irishmen in the States, almost, would have assuredly
gone over to the South, except some who might nave hesitated to take
part against England from doubts as to the certainty of pay and
plunder.
And then what would have been the issue of the struggle for the
Unity of the great American Republic, and the cause of Freedom P
COMING LITERARY EVENTS.
Some writers seem to think there is great virtue in a title, although
they have been told that there is not much in a name. As a heading
for advertisements, they look out for something striking to hit the
popular taste, perhaps believing that Ce n'esl que la premiere page qui
coute. Like conveyancers, they hold tliat very much depends upon
getting a good title; and we are therefore not surprised at bearing
through the medium of a literary clairvoyant, that our circulating
libraries will be ere long enriched by the following new works :—
Skimmed Milk: a Domestic Story, by the Author of Below the Surface.
The Tubbing Rooms of Trinidad: a Sketch in Water Colours, published
as a sequel to The Bath* and Wells of Europe.

Tame Life in a Milkwalk: a Book of London Travel, written as a Com-
panion to Wild Life among the Kurds.

A Book, or pamphlet, is advertised under the name of Income-Tax
Tables. The uncalculating reader will perhaps misunderstand the
nature of the Tables so called. He may possibly imagine that Income-

expense of the classes amerced by it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July Wth. On this day, and for some days later, good
men hoped that the most wicked war of the century (we do not
forget Schleswig-Holstein),
would be prevented. The
pretexts for that war were
stated here last week. To-
night, the Foreign Secre-
tary, Lord Granville, in-
terrogated by Lokd Mal-
mesbury, made a state-
ment, of which this is a por-
tion. After mentioning his
having received the Seals of
the Foreign Office on the
previous Wednesday, and
having been told by the
Permanent Under - Secre-
tary, Mr. Hammond, that
he had never during his
long experience known such
a lull in foreign affairs, his
Lordship mentioned that
the same evening he re-
ceived a telegram informing
him that Prince Leopold
of Hohenzollern had ac-
cepted the crown of Spain.
"Next day," said Lord
Granville,
"I had an interview with
M. Layalette, the French
Ambassador, who informed me
of what I already knew; and
in very eloquent and energetic
terms expressed to me the great
injury which had been done,
and the great offence which
bad just been giren to France,
and the determination of the
Government of the Emperor
not to submit to the project.
He said he trusted Her Ma-
jesty's Government, from the
friendly feelings which they
entertained towards France,
and from their desire to main-
tain peace, would use their
efforts with the other Powers
concerned in the affair. I told
him that the announcement
had taken the Prime Minister
and myself entirely by sur-
prise; that I could not admit
all the arguments he had
used; and that I wished to
reserve my opinion on the
general question. I expressed regret that such
stro»g language had been made use of at the out-
set of the affair by the French Government, but I
admitted the existence of strong excitement in the
public mind with respect to the question. I said
that our friendly relations with France, and our
anxious desire to contribute to the maintenance of
European peace, would make us endeavour, with-
out any undue interference with the dignity of
other countries, to press upon them at all times
the necessity of examining this important question
in all its serious aspects. This is the principle
upon which Her Majesty's Government have since
acted. I have been in communication not only
with France, Prussia, and Spain, but with all the
other great Powers or their representatives: and I
have good reason to believe that those other Powers
are til anxious for peace, and also desirous of
contributing each its share to the maintenance
of it."
In the House of Commons on the same eve-
ning, the Premier, in reply to Sir William
Htjtt, said, "that Her Majesty's Government
had exercised and would exercise all the legiti-
mate influence they may be supposed to possess
with due regard to the self-respect and dignity
of Foreign Powers, for the purpose of pre-
venting any event so ruinous and deplorable as
a European convulsion with its consequent
confusion and bloodshed."

Reprat what he Said, the next
mornino, when he discovered that
what he took for a watch-pocket
was A Ventilating Aperture!—and
his Watch Imredded in the Mud at
the Bottom of his Trench I
How the exercise of that legitimate influence failed, and how the
public mind was disturbed during the week, is at present fresh in the
memories of all, but as this record will be referred to in after days, we
mention that for several days the word was Peace. It was known that
the Kino of Prussia had virtually conceded at least all that France
had a right to ask, and that
the Prince had withdrawn his
candidature. But on Friday
evening England learned
that France had Declared
War. That night in the
House of Lords, the Foreign
Minister briefly expressed
his concern and grief at
being obliged to give cre-
dence to the war news.
In the Commons question
and answer were more de-
tailed. Mr. Disraeli, with
no undue elaboration, stated
the case as it was under-
stood, and here is part of
his speech:—
"It is said that between the
two allies of Her Majesty,
between whom this unhappy
misconception seemed suddenly
to have arisen, there hare been
for a long time many causes of
misconception and misunder-
standing, much jealousy and
distrust, and many questions
as to their mutual relations,
or their relations with other
countries of Europe, which
have been left open and un-
settled, and that suddenly there
has been a resolution in some
quarters to bring about a preci-
pitate settlement of these ques-
tions. If there be any truth
in this statement, the cause of
controversy between these
allies of Her Majesty has not
arisen from the invasion of
each other's territory, or from
any outrage which has been
committed against the national
honour of either throne. It is
purely a diplomatic question,
and the causes have existed for
some time. Now, both those
powerful states have, within a
very short time, solicited the
advice and prayed for the in-
fluence of Her Majesty to be
exercised on their behalf. They
have done more than that,
they have entreated Her Ma-
jesty to enter into engage-
ments, and even perilous engagements, with the
view of furthering their interests, of securing the
peace of Europe, and giving them an opportunity,
and a happy opportunity, of terminating all the
questions of dissidence between them. In these
circumstances, I must express my opinion that
whatever may be the political competence of
France or Prussia at this moment to declare and
carry on war—and no one can question that—I say
that under the circumstances which I have recalled
to the memory of Parliament, neither France nor
Prussia has a right to enter into any war—no
moral right, at least, to enter into any war—with-
out fully and really consulting Great Britain."
He had no doubt that Government had done
its duty ably, but he thought that a public
announcement to that effect would have a
beneficial effect upon Europe. He therefore
formally asked the question whether the Gov-
ernment had reminded France and Prussia of
the sacrifices and exertions made for them by
England. He concluded in language which
expresses the feelings of all of us:—
"The ruler of any country who at this time
disturbs the peace of Europe incurs the gravest
political and moral responsibility— (Cheers)—
which can fall to the lot of any man. I hear, Sir,
superficial remarks made about military surprises,
captured capitals, and the brilliancy and celerity

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
'with which results may be brought about at this moment which are not ex-
pected or contemplated. Sir, these are events of a bygone age. In the 'last
century such melodramatic catastrophes were frequent, and they were effec-
tive. But we live in an age animated by a very different spirit. The fate
of a great country like France, or a great country like Prussia, cannot be
ultimately affected by such results; and the Sovereign who trusts in them
will find at the moment of action, wherever he may be placed, that he
has to encounter a greater and a more powerful force than any military
array, and that is the ovtraged opinion op an enlightened world."
(Cheers.)
The House might well cheer words so worthy of an English states-
man. We complete the story of the week with a part of the Prime
Minister's reply. Mr. Gladstone said that under the Protocol of the
Paris Congress of 1856, England had a right to be heard by any Powers
before they resorted to the last terrible extremity of arms. He would
not then enter into the alleged causes of the war. Communications
ind transactions had not been favourable.
"Any functions we can discharge, or offices we can render, are necessarily
! limited: but I have hope that when the time comea—and it will soon arrive—
\t which it will be our duty to explain in detail that which it is now not less
our duty to withhold, the House may be of opinion that Her Majesty's
Government have not fallen short of the duties incumbent on them as repre-
•entatives of England, and that likewise they have not gone beyond those
duties." (Cheers.)
There is the Story of the Week, as it was illustrated in the English
Parliament, but we may make it complete by inserting a few passages
from the speech made by the French Minister, on Friday. After de-
scribing previous steps taken in consequence of the acceptance by the
Prince, M. Ollivier said:—
"We received an intimation from the Spanish Ambassador that the Prince
of Hohenzollkrn had renounced the crown. We asked the King to associate
himself with this renunciation, and to engage that should the Crown be again
offered to the Prince op Hohenzollern, he would refuse his authorisation.
This engagement demanded the King refused to give. Later our surprise was
great when we learned that the King had refused to receive M. Brnedetti.
We learned that Baron Werther had received orders to take his leave, and
that Prussia was arming. Under these circumstances we should have forgotten
our dignity and also our prudence had we not made preparations. We have
prepared to maintain the war which is offered to us, leaving to each that
portion of the responsibility which devolves upon him. (Enthusiastic and
prolonged applause.) Since yesterday we have called out the reserve, and we
shall take the necessary measures to guard the interest, and the security, and

Thus is set before Europe what England and France have heard from
their rulers on the preparations for A Duel to the Drath. We
have yet to hear Prussir. And so
"A Monarch's Voice
Cries 'Havoc,' and' bids' slip the Dogs of War."
Fortunately the other proceedings in our own Parliament do not
make much demand upon the valuable intellect of Mr. Punch. One
night the Commons took it into their heads to sit until about five in
the morning, putting out the gas, and again letting sunlight in upon
themselves. This sounds patriotic, but the fact is that the nights were
so awfully hot, that a cool public building (with the opportunity of a
water-side lounge and smoke, and iced drinks) was pleasanter than
bed. Mr. Punch regrets to have to state this stern truth, but it is his
duty. Lord Stratford de Redcltffe moved an address about the
Greek Brigandage, but Government declared that they were doing all
they coul<f do, so the motion was withdrawn. The Education Bill has
been the great piece of resistance in the Commons, but you do not
want details. Mr. Treveltan explained that he had left the Ministry,
at the risk of being thought squeamish and Quixotic, because he could
not approve its course in regard to Denominational schools. The
water in the Regent's Park is offensive, and is to be deepened—of
course a mistake, it ought to be made to flow more rapidly. If Mr.
Atrton will send a commission to examine the ducks, they will tell
him all about it, and he may have more confidence in them than in
any cognate birds who advise the absurd course suggested.
The "Lectionary"—we beg Lord Shaptesrury's pardon—the
"Table of Lessons" Bill offended some by recognising Convocation,
but Lord Shaptesrury ridiculed " hobgoblin arguments," and by 60
to 24 the recognition was maintained. The valuable Benefices Bill
(affecting parsons who don't pay their debts) was passed by the Lords
by 29 to 18.
Truck system, supposed to be put down, was shown by Mr. Mun-
jella to be in full force and virtue—we mean vice. Why do not the
artisans take this up, by means of their Unions P There is to be a
Commission. Lord Hartington apologised for telegraphic short-
comings, and made a good case. There is no doubt that the Post-
Office telegram has become an Institution.
On Wednesday the Queen was to have opened the Thames Em-
bankment, but Her Majesty's health forbad this, so the Heir-Apparent
and the charming Princess Louise performed the ceremony, the Mem-
bers of the Board of Works looking, according to the reports, uncom-
monly shabby. The Commons, after seeing the sight, took one (excuse
the hideous vulgarity) at Sir Wilprid Lawson, and threw out his
Bill for Permissive Prohibition of Liquor, except to those who have
cellars. But Mr. Bruce again promised a Bill for reducing the number
of Public-Houses.
On Thursday the Marquis of Salisrury caused the University
Tests Bill to be sent to a Select Committee, which of course means its
fate. Said not Mr. Punch so by means of that fatal Dash, last
week P Some Bishops spoke wisely and liberally.
Friday night's chief business has been told. The Lords discussed
the Commons' amendments on the Peers' amendments, assented to
the most important, but held to some others, and the Commons
Supplied in the morning, and at night were Counted Out, for their
minds, like those of all the rest of us, were full of the news from Paris,

AN AMERICAN EXAMPLE.
An American Correspondent of the Times says that " the Income-tax
is doomed," the Senate having " stricken by a decided vote all the
sections providing for its collection out of the Tax Bill." The provisions
for the collection of the Income-tax in the United States must have
been very cleverly contrived if they in any measure answered their
purpose. Fancy a Yankee confessing the amount of his income in order
to have it taxed. The machinery required to make him do that must,
one would think, be of a material nature. How much conscience
money, on an average, is the American finance Minister accustomed to
receive in the course of a year t
Not More Free than Welcome.

newspaper and chipped his second egg, "Ah, that will be when one is
free to eat one's breakfast without having to wade through atfarlia-
mentary debate!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL

A MAYOR'S GAUNTLET.
y NTIQTJABIAN8 doubt
whether Kingston
(on Thames) derives
its name from the
Stone which may be
seen there, and on
which Kings have to
sit when they visit
t he place. They find
this difficult now,
because the stone is
surrounded by high
railings; and unless
the official who has
the key of the gate
be in the way, Ma-
jesty must climb,
which is not digni-
fied. But whatever
way Kingston may
get its name, there
can be no difference
of opinion as to the
skill of its most dia
tinguished inhabit-
ants in applying
names to one another.
Here is a portion of a report, from the Surrey Comet, of a recent
scene at a Town Council meeting; and Mr. Punch, who adores Town
Councils for their wisdom, decorum, and philanthropy, gladly presents
his readers with the following gems of oratory.
The question was about certain paving, and
"Alderman Gould was proceeding to speak of the durability of concrete
in the basements of some of his bouses, when—
"Mr. Fox told him to ' cut it short.'
"Alderman Gould thought when gentlemen did not attend Council
meetings above once or twice in three months, they ought to exercise a little
patience, and not interrupt with any impertinent remarks, whether it be to
cut it short or cut it long.
"Mr. Fox. It is not an impertinent remark. I have wasted whole nights
here through you.
"Aldeeman Gould. There is not a man in the Council who has attended
less to public business; and then you come to interrupt."
After this skirmish, debate was resumed, and—
"Aldrrman Williams really, thought that gentlemen should pause, and
wait for better times. They could not help the shops.
"Mr. M'Inttre. You would at one time have helped the shops.
"Alderman Williams. I want none of your personalities, Mr. M'Intvre.
If you throw stones, I will throw them too.
"Throwing stones " was a very proper image when a paving question
was on. But subsequently—
"Mr. Barratt said, that several of the Highway Committee were con-
nected with the Spring Grove Estate; and they should find some fine morning
that some of those footpaths would be done also.
"Mr. M'Inttre. You go and hang yourself about Spring drove! The
Spring-Grove people have got more money than you have got. Saying this,
Mr. M'Intyre rose and left the room, slamming the door after him.
Mr. Punch does not quite understand Mr. M'Inttre's advice to
Mr. Barjlatt. There are trees in Spring Grove; but a gentleman
could hardly hang himself " about" a place, though he might decorate
a single tree in the way suggested. But to this Mr. Punch would
object, because the spectacle would be an unpleasant one for the pupils
of the admirable International College which has made the fame of
Spring Grove. On the whole, Mr. Punch is glad to notice, in a later
report, that Mr. Bajlratt has declined to accept the M'Intyrish
counsel, and remains alive and well. But, to go on.
"Alderman Gray said, as far as he was concerned, he did not intend to
attend the Highway Committee any longer. He could not stop there to be in-
sulted and abused in all sorts of ways. Mr. Alderman Wells was also
grossly insulted, and so was the surveyor. He could not sit with a body of
men who, in case of a difference of opinion arising, treated him with suoh a
volley of abuse that it was quite impossible for him to act."
but since

Well, disagreeable if not impossible, certainly, Alderman;
when have Town Councillors grown to be particular in such
Finally—
"Mr. Jones, having asked which of the Members of the Council was bold
enough to get up and declare a vacancy,
"The Mayor, who had just arrived, said it devolved upon him in his
official capacity to throw down the gauntlet."
"Throw down the o-auntlet!" That is a diah of chivalry at 1 st;
and, having brought the Council to a poirt at which he can gaze ou
them with pride and glory, he leaves tut* to pick up the glove of the
valiant Mayor.
SONG OF THE WASHED-OUT VOLUNTEER.
(Apropos of Monday Se'mighfs Downpour.)
Air—" A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea."
A wet sheet and a wetter shirt,
And a rain that falleth fast!
A foot of water in my tent,
And the "lights out" bugle-blast!
The "lights out" bugle-blast, my boys!
And all dark, though at sea!
Away my luggage floats, and like
A drowned rat leaves me!
"What joy, in camp oneself to find!"
I heard a fair one cry:
But give to me a two-pair back.
With bed-clothes warm and dry!
With bed-clothes warm and dry, my boys,
Prosaic though they be—
This world of water's not our home,
Nor merry men are we!
A red eclipse snuffs out the moon,
And lanterns aren't allowed:
So damp and dark, poor Volunteers,
Blow the consoling cloud!
Blow the consoling cloud, my boys,
While the rain runneth free:
A wet-through tent no palace is,
With the Common like a sea!
SPARRING AT THE STATION-HOUSES.
The Commissioners at Scotland Yard, we are glad to hear (through
the Pall Mall Gazette) have issued sets of boxing-gloves to the Police
at the various station-houses, and the young constables, we are assured,
take kindly to the exercise in spite of the not weather.
The Ponce, in popular opinion, are overprone to punch other
Eeople's heads. It is to be hoped that any such disposition there may
e will work itself off through the opportunity now afforded them of
punching each other's.
The use of the gloves will, at least, tend to ensure our finding the
younger and livelier members of the Force "on the beat," even when
off duty.
We would suggest that the constables who show themselves handiest
with their maulies should be formed into a "P. R. Division;" and
that from this division should be selected the men for duty in those
parts of the town where Roughs most abound. In this way the ruffians
who know no better sport than "milling a Bobby," will be likely to
meet with their match; and the public may occasionally have the
instructive and improving spectacle of a Rough handsomely thrashed
by the Police, instead of the converse sight now more common. The
Roughs will be all the better for a little polishing off; and nothing
polishes like " elbow-grease."
Bunch of fives against bludgeon any day—even if it have the royal
arms painted on it, and be called a staff!
This issue of boxing-gloves may be Colonel Henderson's answer
to the charges so often brought against him of turning the Police into
Soldiers. Henceforth, the Force will have so many fewer men on the
Staff as it has more on the Spar; and by so much the more milling,
by so much the less drilling. Hitherto the complaint has been that
the Polioe has been "under-manned." Let us hope that the next
complaint may not be that it is " over-sparred."
A Liquor Law Logioian.
The Speech which Sir Wilfrid Lawson inflicted on the House of
Commons, in recommendation of his intended local liquor law, he
might much better have made before in opposition to another measure.
it mainly consisted of an attempt to prove that education cannot be
expected to abate drunkenness. This would have been an argument
much more to the question if it had been urged against the Government
Education Bill. If education will not abate drunkenness, what vice of
any kind whatsoever will it diminish, and what good at all will it do to
recompense us for the rates which we shall have to pay for it P

The Kind of People WHO Take ro much Interest in the Nohle Game of Cricket : they would

PRUSSIAN POT AND FRENCH KETTLE.
In this unhappj event of a war between France and Prussia, we
shall of course do all we can to preserve the most perfect neutrality.
We certainly feel it. Our sympathies with the one side and the other
are, strong as they are, exactly equal.
As regards the Prussians we take a warmly admiring interest in the
course of aggrandisement which their King and his Bismarck have
been pursuing of late years, but most chiefly do we applaud its first
step—the attack on Denmark, and the forcible annexation therefrom
of the two Duchies. The immense number of Danes slain by the
Prussian needle-guns commands our approbation only less than our
wonder; but what crowns the sentiments with which we regard the
spoliation and destruction of the Danes is the piety wherewith the
author of those achievements solemnly expressed his thankfulness for
having been permitted to accomplish them. One brother once knelt
with Mrs. Frx in Newgate. The other might have knelt with Mrs.
Cols.
On the other hand, with respect to France, we cannot bat feel how
much we owe to the French Imperial Government for the improvement
which, by the menacing armaments it has kept up now for so many
years, it has occasioned us to make in our national defences. But we
have higher reasons for sympathy with France than considerations
which are merely insular and selfish. The great principles of Liberty,
Fraternity, and Equality have been professed by France more enthu-
siastically and more loudly than by any other European nation; and
we behold their standing reduotion to practice in the occupation of
Rome, and the declaration that the chief of Italian cities shall never
belong to Italy.
The foregoing reasons should satisfy any Prussian and any French-
man of the perfect impartiality with which Englishmen must
plate hostilities between their respective nations.

A COCKALORUMS HA.PPY THOUGHT.
Drar Redacteur,
I can't help sending you this. It is my friend Captain
Dynowell's account of the present crisis in continental affairs. He
is much interested in the movements of France and Prussia, as it was
some time since a happy thought with him to enter the service of
either country in order to see some fighting and learn the art of war.
He comes into my room, having, according to his old habit at Aix,
read the paper in bed,.and says—
"Here's a go! Old Cockalorum Louis says he means to bustle
'em a bit, and Gladstone got up in the House last night and said he
was very much afraid that it was a case of pickles." This he announces
perfectly seriously, as if it were a report straight out of Haiuard.
Hansard made easy. He continues: There's a regiment of Frenoh
Lancers sent off to the front, wherever that may be; so the gay young
Cockalorum, who thought he'd be quite the Spaniard, won't go on the
scoop this journey."
I suggest that Prince What 's-his-name (being the pleasantest form
of pronouncing the Prussian Cockalorum's title) will be in a peculiarly
awkward position.
"Yes." says the Captain, meditatively, with his glass well in bis eye,
"I think he 11 find himself rather in a cart."
•• I think, perhaps, that from time to time it would be rather a

PRECAUTION TAKEN BY HALVES.
ccokddjg to the report of
Millar's trial on Wednes-
day last, at the Central Court,
Piper, the carman, having
concluded his evidence:—
"At this stage the Court was
adjourned until this (Thursday)
morning at ten o'clock. In the
meantime the jury were taken
to the City Terminus Hotel, in
Cannon Street, in oharge of the
officer of the Court."
Why P What had the jury

gusting imprisonment f

usage of English law.
they were not thus shut
they would, of course,
liable to be intimidated or
bribed; and it is certain that
they would perjure themselves
for fear, or favour, or the sake
of gain, and ill and untruly try, and a false verdict give, in contra-
riety to the evidence for or against the prisoner, and according to the
side whereon they were influenced by corruption or terror, as the case
might be.
Such being inoontestably the corruptibility and cowardliness of
British jurymen, it is fearful to think what an amount of injustice must
be done, and perjury committed, in delivering untrue verdicts, by
juries empanelled on cases of mere misdemeanour or civil action.
Because in these they have not to be locked up, although they are
quite as likely, and as open, to be bought or dastardised as they are in
cases of felony.
Happily, it does not often happen that a nobleman has to be tried
oy his peers like Lord Ferrers, or the late Earl or Cardigan. The
latter got off, though he notoriously had shot his man; and everybody
would naturally have supposed that he owed his escape to the exemp-
tion of noble lords from Being locked up, if his trial had lasted over
one night.
British judges, too, are composed of the same flesh and blood as
British jurymen. Their charge generally determines conviction or
acquittal. My Lords are not less accessible to undue influences than
gentlemen of the jury. When, the question yet remains to be asked— I
when will an improvement upon ancient usage by modern legislation,
as often as a jury must needs be locked up, also lock up the judge P

THOUGHTS OF GBEAT MEN.
(Nowfirit Collected.)
"Love! What a volume in every letter, what a library in the
whole four combined! All nations, languages, dynasties, complexions,
and climates prostrate themselves at its cosmopolitan shrine, and spare
no expense to please the object of their affections. Men have crossed
oceans and Isthmuses of Suez for woman's sake, and come back
crossed in love themselves; women have sought one, the beloved, at
the world's end, and been parted from him for ever at the end of a
fortnight; and men and women and police-constables have smiled and
sighed, have toyed and tiffed in that flowery area where the little
archer reigns supreme, and Cupid has always arrows on sale, and gone
through a sea of trouble and Basinghall Street, because they would
marry on an insufficient income and without their parents' consent."—
Adam Smith.
"Be kind to nobody, but allow everybody to be kind to you.
Always borrow, never lend. Conceal your own ignorance, but make a
point of exposing the ignorance of others. Flatter to the face, abuse
behind the hack. Earn a sovereign, spend a guiner. Don't go to bed
at all, and always get up late. Turn night into day, and your old
clothes into money. You can only skate in the winter, you can back-
slide all the year round. Pay a man off in his own coin, but owe him
a grudge. There are three things you should never take—a hint,
advice, and a glass of cold water when you are hot. Yon cannot give
youth his latch-key too early. You need not be cruel, but you may
backbite. Dissemble: never show your teeth except to your dentist."—
Dr. Watts.
"Exercise is conducive to health, and an agreeable country ramble
is the best dinner-pill. Observe all you see in your rural walks with a
'How changed the scene from that dear day
When she and I both strayed away
Through vales and valleys, combes and hills;
And met the tradesmen with their bills,
And heard the yellow-hammer sing
His carol at the call of Spring,
To fifty feathered friends around,
And reapers seated on the ground,
Dining at noon beneath the trees
On bread and meat, or bread and cheese,
And drinking cold refreshing tea,
Or beer from neighbouring brewery;
With, crowning zest, the common joy
Of peer and peasant, man and boy—
The weed that soothes, sustains, and cheers,
In manhood's prime and age's years,
That says to care thou shalt not stay,
To trouble take thyself away,
To debts and duns and dental pain,
Begone and never come again!"
Cradre.
TRUTHFUL TALES.
Dr. Newton, the "healing medium" from America (U.8.) pro-
fesses to cure diseases partly by mesmerism, and partly by means of
spirits—disembodied, not alcoholic. Hence the spiritualist newspapers
have been devoting much of their space to the publication of his alleged
cures, of which here is one:—
"Mas. Bssaxspeakr, 73, Cromer Street, Gray's Inn Koad. Her baby,
twelve months old, had curvature of the spine for the last six months. The
curvature entirely disappeared in one minute, under the hands of Dr.
Newton."
To confute every gainsayer of spiritual therapeutics, this case only
requires confirmation. There can be no mistake about spinal curva-
ture, duly vouched for. If the fact of the curvature of the spine having
existed antecedently to the child's coming under the hands of Dr.
Newton, and then having disappeared, so as to have been, ha ha!
cured in a minute, were only attested by but one metropolitan hospital
surgeon, it is not too much to say that the whole medical profession
would believe in the curative powers of Dr. Newton, and advise the
British Public to credit them too. The entire faculty would pin upon
Dr. Newton as undoubting a faith as that which it reposes in rhubarb.
As it is, doctors, and sane persons generally, will have their doubts
about the cure of Mrs. Brraksfrare's baby. But let not spiritualists
too hastily call them sceptics. The subjoined statement is one which
few, probably, of even the most incredulous of medical men, will be
inclined to doubt:—
"On the first morning a lame Irishman came, using a wooden leg, his
natural limb projecting out behind him, bent at the knee; with much labour
the doctor unstrapped the wooden auxiliary, and sent away the gratified and
grateful Hibernian with it on his shoulder."
"This, now, is a case about which there can be no reasonable question.
We have not the slightest difficulty in believing that the incidents of
it, as related by an eye-witness, actually occurred. Indeed, we can
conceive nothing more likely, under the circumstances, than that a man
did limp into the presence of Dr. Newton with a bent knee and a
wooden leg, and walk out of it with the knee straight and the wooden
leg on his shoulder; especially an Irishman. Of all men we should
think that an Irishman would be the likeliest to exhibit so prodigious
an instance of spiritual healing.
New Invention.
The ingenious application of paper to various useful purposes has
been largely developed since the duty was taken off that article of
commerce, and now we have got to "paper boys." They may be seen,
and heard in every street in London.

THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.
Of course, when we meet the Great Boompje M aullie, afterwards at
Antwerp, he exclaims—
"What! not seen the Belfry! Not seen the Gymnasium! Why,
my dear fellows, you've missed the only things you ought to have seen.
But this we set down (subsequently) to Boompje.
Before Maullie and his hat had appeared, Gooch is horrified at
the appearance of Mr. Jomp, the Courier. He says he doesn't mind it
while travelling, and, when we were at Lille, driving round the town
in a fly, with Jomp on the box, in the entr'acte allowed us (by Mr.
Jomp's excellent management, who had so contrived our journey that
there was no station where we didn't stop a quarter of an hour at least
—with nothing whatever to do, and no buffet—" Veil," said the inven-
tive Jomp, "um— um—um—you can valk about") between the arrival
and departure of the trains; but now we are at Ghent, a town, and
with a dashing carriage (it certainly is that), and a coachman in livery,
with a new cockade, he must protest against Jomp being on the box,
unless he has a costume. What sort of dress P we ask.
Well, he has seen the sort of thing he means in the Bois, and on a
foreign ambassador's, or some foreign swell's, carriage in Hyde Park.
He proposes something military. (Boompje.)
First proposed drest—Rejected on account of being too much like a
French marichal on the box.
Second proposed dress—Rejected on account of its being painful to
Mr. Jomp's feelings to appear in a footman's dress.
"But it won't be a footman's dress," explains Gooch, "when you
get the colours."
Thirdly—Gooch recollected a Polish count, whose servant used to
appear at Baden in various uniforms. Boompje argument: "Why not
be taken for Polish Counts P"
"The dress of a Chasseur," says Gooch, "would be distingui, and
old Jomp wouldn't mind that."
Old Jomp does mind it, however: but owns that his present
appearance is not all that could be desired. "I vould vear anoder
hat," he explains, "um—um—um—" and then adds, after carefully
thinking it out, "if I 'ad rmn" Jomp can't say fairer than this,
evidently. Even the philosophic Bayle, who died in a house on the
Boompje, would have been satisfied with this as logical.
Gooch's opinion is, that Mr. Jomp resembles a travelling pedlar
with umbrellas to mend. This comes from our having given him out
umbrellas and our satchels to carry for us. The shape of his hat
probably arises from its having been slept in the greater part of the
way, and sat upon during the rest.
This is the compromise procured in Ghent at a tailor's. A livery
coat, formerly the property of a duchess, but sent back because the
family had gone into the deepest mourning. Black, with yellow facings,
and black tags to shoulders. High black hat, with gold band: cockade,

decorously, and not bringing Boompje principles into play while the
people are engaged in their services] and finally, after breakfast, we drive
to the Blguinage, the College of Nuns, who live in a little town of their
own, take no vows, stay as long or as short as they like, occupy them-
selves in nursing and teaching, and so forth, and wear a white sort of
towel on their heads, which, six hundred of them, one after the other,
as they enter Church, unfold and spread, one after another, all in one
action, over their heads, and then just drawing down the front to cover
their noses, devotionally, retire to their seats.
We three, and four others of our sex, are the only men in the
Church. We shrink into as small a space as possible, and keep near
the door, with the view of retiring noiselessly should there be a
sermon.
It is admitted on all hands, that, at all events, there is no Boompje
here. "The Begums are not the sort of people to put a Courier into
livery," observes the Secretary to Gooch. Gooch objects to this, that
they do wear a livery. This leading to no issue, the conversation drops.
Gooch presently says that up till this moment he had always thought
the Beguins were birds.
Commodore Bund supposes he's thinking of Penguins. Gooch
considers it not unlikely. Conversation number two dropped.

At Antwerp we see Maullie's hat in the distance, and, in three
minutes more, we find Maullie under it.
Maullie is hearty and full of spirits. He stands at the door of the
Hotel St. Antoine, and cries out, "Hooray! hip! hip! hooray!"
(Boompje.)
"He might have said,' Br-r-ravo,'" Gooch grumbles, and expresses
his wish that our meeting had been in a private room (also Boompje).
Gooch wants to know if dinner has been ordered. No, it has not.
Well, then, what can we have P
The waiter answers promptly, "Roas-beef, roas-mutton"
"And plum-pud<fa<w it! cnes Gooch, in a rage.
Maullie says, good-naturedly, " Oh, anything for him."
This disgusts Gooch more than the waiter's announcement.
"Of course," he says, " if you say you don't care; and hooray, and
tip, hip on the steps of the hotel, of course they'1l give you beef and
mutton." And he boompjes out of the room, and comes against Jomp
on the landing.
"Hang it, Jomp !" he savs, "you ought to know. What can one
get here besides this—this—beef and mutton P"
"Veil," replies Jomp, astutely, "um—um—nm—" And we expect,
by his considering so long, that we shall hear of some dish peculiar to
Antwerp. So we wait while Jomp polishes his head with his handker-
chief, and thinks it ont. "Veil," he says, presently—" Um—um—you
can 'ove someting else."
Carried, nem. cox., that Jomp is an ass. This unanimity restores
good humour; and the landlord is charged with the task of providing
a recherchi dinner on the distinct understanding that he is to avoid
beef, mutton, and plum-pudding.
At Antwerp. We see all the great pictures and churches for the fifth
time (for three of us) and assist at an alfresco concert in the Botanical
Gardens in the evening. Here the best people of Anvers are present
in grand toilette. Gooch hears Maullie, with Bund, discussing art
in loud tones, and addresses himself to me piteously. "I wish. Be
says, "Maullte wouldn't come out in that hat. Hang it! you know,
lie wouldn't do it at the Zoo in London. And why will he speak
English P Or. if he must speak it, why does he do it so loud." Gooch,
himself, is delivering all this to me apart and confidentially. What he
does say aloud he says in French, and kicks me under the table im-
patiently if I don't answer in that language. Gooch points out to me,
always in his character of mm vrai Partsien (Boompje all over), that
young Belgium imitates jeune France in dress. Gooch, wishing to be
thought young France, or what he calls, a petit creoi, evidently thinks
he is attracting the favourable attention of a young lady most elegantly
dressed, who, ne imagines, takes him for some leader of the fashion
from Paris. He sees Maullie approaching. He foresees that that
confounded hat and Maullie's lonaL very plain English will destroy
all illusion as to his being a French Count.
Henceforth we call him the Count.
Another thing very distressing to Gooch is that Buns insists upon
Jomp carrying for him a large bag, containing, amdng other things,
Murray and Bradshaui. With this Jomp has to follow or lead us, as the
case may be, and Bund stops him for reference, whenever he requires
information. Maullie disconcerts him dreadfully by always wanting
to stop suddenly in streets, and "take bite." in his sketch-book. He
pulls up before an old gabled house, "There 's a bit!" he exclaims
enthusiastically, and out comes his sketch-book. "Hang it," says
the Count, "you don't see foreigners doing that in London. Be
wouldn't do it in London. If he did. the police would move him on.
And then, adds Gooch piteously, "he gets all the little boys round
him." Which is perfectly true, and they interest themselves as much
in the Count as in the sketching.
And now by train through the flattest country; then on board
a steamer, up a long, melancholy river, embanked by rushes. We are
all becoming more and more depressed as we near our destination:
at last, we see a terrace not unlike that at Southsea, or Littlehampton,
with a touch of Ramsgate in it, too, and a dash of Chelsea, by the
river-side, near Cremorne. This is our first view of Rotterdam. After
passing in front of a line of respectable red-brick houses, with little
gardens (like those attached to the suburban houses of Brompton or
Chelsea in the position above mentioned), we step at last upon
THE BOOMPJE.
There is elasticity in the word. Depression vanishes. In comes our
luggage. Down goes Gooch's portmanteau. Whack. Boompje!
Down goes Bund's on the top of it. Don't be annoyed. Gentlemen; it's
all right—Boompje! Smash the caspet-bag heavily, bang the hat-box,
mix our things up with somebody else's luggage—(Gooch asks if there
wasn't a novel called, Somebody Else's Luggage, but receives no answer)—
shovel 'em up, knock 'em down, stave in the side of that lady's box,
drop the large portmanteau on to that evident bonnet-case.—whack,
jerk, bang, anything you like; and here we are in the land of Boompje!
Down the passages; Boompje! luggage into rooms; on to the
stands; on to the floors; wrong box in right room; right box, wrong
room; bustle, bootjacks, and Boompje! Landlord apologises; but
one hundred and seventy passengers nave just arrived, and he's full.
Boompje!
_ Sorry he can't give us better rooms. There's one down-stairs; a
sitting-room and a bed-room, with four beds in it. All for the Com-
modore.
The Count, Maullie, and the Secretary are distributed about the
first-floor passages. Me. Jomp follows everybody else's packages, and
finally rescues ours.
Maullie, of course, has no soap. He is heard crying out for soap
loudly to the garfon de chambre (a Dutchman). "What sort P " asks
the Waiter.
Maullie, busy unpacking, replies, " Any sort; only look sharp."
Gooch says, Why on earth doesn't Maullie speak French; he '1I
never get any soap."
The Count is right. When we are nearly ready, Maullie is still
ringing an electric Dell in his room, and holloaing for soap.
To him the garfon, in a hurry, with a small tureen, a napkin, a spoon,
and a large plate.
"What the Boompje's this P" exclaims Maullie. "I've been
ringing for soap this half-hour."
Could not pring'em pe-fore; it take some time to hot." And
therewith he sets it down on the table; and, whisking off the napkin,
discovers a basin of hot Julien soup. Shouts from the Count, the Sec.,
and Mr. Jomp.
Maullie bawls at him—
"Soap! not soup."
The Count [with dignity). "Le Monsieur veut dire 'savon:' com-
prenez, savon P"
Garfon. "Ah! vy he ask for soup P
[Exit Garfon with soup, and returns with soap.
In a lofty room, with a painted mythological ceiling and carved
mantelpiece, we sit down to dinner. Gooch has forgot to inquire
about the menu. It is brought in. Soup, roast beef, mutton, and
plum-puddang!!! Boompje!!

be further shocked by the announcement of " ailing salmon or "con-

The Syllabus and the Stake.
In a column of book advertisements you may have noticed the
announcement of a collection of tracts or essays under the title of
"Principles at Stake." This suggests a comparison of the present

FASHIONABLE FORGERY.
In the midst ot the dread tidings which the correspondents have lately
been sending us from Paris, it is pleasant to find somebody writing
thence to tell us something of the fashions. To divert our thoughts
from matters more tremendous, we are considerately informed of these
diverting facts:—
"Golden hair U still in great request, and dyes are largely used in order to
procure the fashionable colour."
So that "auri tacra fames" now is not felt merely on the Bourse;
and, were Horace's old flame, the "'lava Chloe" now in France, her
hair would be the envy of the fashionable world. In order to look
killing, ladies dye themselves; and, doubtless, would wear green hair
just as readily as golden, if fashion so decreed. Such she-pirates do
not scruple to sail under false colours, and forge a head as quickly as a
ship in a strong tideway. For what is changing black or grey to gold
but a fashionable forgery, which surely should be treated as a capital
offence f Such fair culprits fairly deserve to lose their heads, or, at all
events, their chignons, which they would, doubtless, part with as un-
willingly as they would lose their heads. It is no shame to a woman
to be seen wearing a little silver in her hair: but she is an offender
against the laws of Nature, if she takes to forgery, and tries to wear
false gold in it.
A Word to the Wise.
( When our Collective Witdom hat sanctioned Female voting.)
Would you gain the tender creature,
With soft sawder you must treat her,
Honied words may win her heart:
Ladies fair a vote possessing,
Sadly may misuse the blessing,
Be they not cajoled with art.
BEETHOVEN IN BAD COMPANY.
Tiiere has been a " Beethoven Festival" at New York, in which
the majestic music of the mighty master seems to have been set off by
inter-mezti of Offenbachian and Nigger melody with a daring defiance
of high-art, purism and propriety, which, however John Bull might
have enjoyed it, only Jonathan Bull is bold enough to venture upon.
Among these lively interludes was included (according to one report)
the singing of a song from La Grande Duchesse, by Mrs. Howard Paul,
"in character."
We do not wonder that the lady should have written to contradict
this report. We call special attention to the passage of her contradic-
tion in which she declares "that no song or piece was given 'in
character' by any artiste engaged."
We should think this in the highest degree probable. The whole
festival seems to have been "out of character," alike in the case of the
executants and the audience.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
NDAY, July I8M.
Having announced
the War, and hav-
ing permitted En-
glish and French
s'atesmen to state
in these columns
I heir views of their
own conduct, we
propose to give
space to a portion
•if the address of
I he North German
Parliament to their
"old and heroic
king," and thence-
forth to make only
the briefest refer-
ence to the Crime
which is exciting
the indignation of
all Christian and
civilised men:—
"One single thought animates all German hearU. It was with joy and
5ride that the nation learnt the earnestness and dignity with which your
[ajesty repelled the unheard-of presumption of France. The German people
desires to live at peace with those, nations which respect its independence. As
at the time of the wars of Liberation a Napoleon forced us into a sacred
struggle, now, as then, calculations based upon the unfaithfulness of th6
German 8tates will be shattered by the force of the German people. The mis-
guided French nation will recognise, when it is too late, the bad seed it is
sowing, now that the most reasonable portion of their fellow countrymen have
failed to avert a great national crime. A hard and violent struggle is before
us. We rely upon the valour of our brothers in arms, who will not bend the
knee before a foreign invader. We place our trust in our old and heroic
King, to whom Providence has granted that he should, in the eve of life,
bring to a close the war in which he fought in his youth. We place our trust,
finally, in God, who will aurely punish the wicked audacity of the invader.
The people has risen unanimously, and public opinion throughout the world
recognises the justice of our cause."
To-night Earl Granville and Mr. Gladstone stated that a
Declaration of War having been forwarded from Paris to Berlin, our
Queen's Proclamation of Neutrality would at once issue. This has
appeared. It will be obeyed in letter and in spirit by Her Majesty's
subjects, but it must be remembered that there can be no Neutrality
on a question of morals, and in these kingdoms public opinion has
unmistakeably expressed itself in regard to the War, which England
holds to be needless, and therefore wicked. Be the issue what it may,
British protest is placed on record, and, be it remembered, also, that
"Wrong never comes Right."
Lord Kinnalrd wanted to inquire into the management of the
Royal Mint, where he thinks matters are not managed economically.
Lord Lansdotvne defended the institution. No instructive remark
occurs to Mr. Punch, except that "mint" is from the Saxon mynet,
and that the verb mynetian means " to coin." Perhaps you '11 say you
knew that. Bah! Perhaps you'll say you didn't want to know it.
Boo! Do you know what a mint-julep isP A drink consisting of
brandy, sugar, and pounded ice, flavoured with sprigs of mint. Is not
that a pleasant thing to read about, this sultry weatherP Go and
make some, and repent your ingratitude to your best friend.
Married Women's (why not Wives' P) Property Bill went through
Committee. Observe, young husband! It contains a clause, enabling
you, when you assure your life, as every honest man who has no
fortune, does, to make a declaration that the insurance is for your wife
and children. Then your friends Nipp, Shamgold, Weeds, Nebuchad- j
nezzar, and other ministers to your vanity, self-indulgence, and luxury,
will not be able to deprive your family of the provision you have made.
Nexlly, avoid vanity, self-indulgence, and luxury.
Mr. Gladstone was not sure what he should do about the Uni-
versity Tests Bill, which Lord Salisrury has sent to a Committee.
These are chemical tests, M its. Ramsrothax, which, when applied to a
Dissenter, make him look blue.
Small Massacre. Savings Bank Bill, Mines Regulation Bill, Ballot
Bill, perish, thanks to the flood of talk in which they drown, like
kittens.
Mr. Reid, Chief Constructor of the Navy, resigned, that he might
go into lucrative partnership with Sir Joseph Whitworth, but
thinking that in the present crisis his services might be useful, tendered
them to the Admiralty. "My Lords do not see occasion to avail
themselves of your offer." If that be what my Lords call civil,
Ayrtonism must be contagious.
In Supply there was some gun-talk, not uninteresting just now, even
to people who do not know a blunderbuss from a revolver. We are
considering the Mitrailleuse. It is to be feared that new information
as to its value will speedily be obtained. By the way, is this thing
called "new" P Mr. Punch has a distinct recollection of having seen
one in the Tower, when he last took country cousins there, and that,
you may be sure, is a precious jolly long time ago. He bets that the
noble old Constable Burgoyne could lay his hand on the thing in
a minute. Don't let those foreigners claim the merit of everything.
Tuesday, Lord Shaptesrury begged leave to assure their Lord-
ships that he had not been Whipping them. Somebody, using the
Earl's name, had sent them a circular, desiring them to be in their
places, at a certain stage of the Ecclesiastical Courts Bill, but he would
not have been guilty of such arrogance. If Mr. Punch, who never
forgets anything, remembers rightly, the famous Chandos Peerage,
for which Sir Egerton Brydges fought a life-long battle (even
editing Collins' Peerage in nine volumes, that he might insert his
story of the case) was lost, through the Lords taking offence at being
addressed by the claimant, Sir Egerton's brother, in a circular similar
to that described by Lord Shaftesrurt. Our aristocrats may be led
(though not by the Duke of Kichmond) but will not be driven.
Christmas Day (the idea of its coolness is refreshing—but we must
do what we can with iced claret cup—what ho there, vassal!) is on
Sunday this year. Mr. Bruce does not see his way to enacting a
holiday on the Saturday. The grievance does not occur very often,
and the weekly Saturday balf-holiday does.
Her Majesty responded to the Address against building public
offices on the Embankment. Nothing is to be done without the leave
of the House, and "no action is to be taken" (so this phrase has got
into Royal documents, eh P) this year.
Education all the morning. Observed Mr. Newdrgate :—
"It had been said that children were incapable of understanding the Bible,
but tho practice of the Christian world for centuries confuted that assertion,
and he would put it to any man whether maxims and texts of Scripture taught
in his early life did not in time of trouble come to his memory for his
assistance."
Quite right, dear Mr. Newdrgate, but it is also well the children,
young and old, should be made to understand the real meaning of
maxims and texts, on which there existeth not, as a rule, too much
clearness of apprehension, or there would not he so many bitter differ-
ences among good persons. Wherefore, we look with some hope to
the Jerusalem Chamber.
Poor old incarcerated Mr. Edmunds's case was brought on by
Mr, Russell Gurney. When a man who has lived in comfort is
poor, old, and in prison, compassion for him is so natural that we turn
to such an authority as Sir Roundell Palmer, and when he says.
"Mr. Edmunds was a defaulter in respect of public funds committed
to his care, out of which funds he made illegitimate profit," we can
but listen m silence to Mr. West, who said:—
"If a wretched boy robbed his master's till of eightcen-pencs he was sent
to prison, but if a public servant deprived the Exchequer of some thousands of
pounds, a morbid sympathy was raised for him, and an outcry was raised if he
were dealt with according to law."
Bathing, bathing—that is a pleasant topic for this weather. Not
that Mr. Ayrton contributed an element of pleasantness to it, for he
abused the poor bathers in the Serpentine, and objected to do anything
for the safety of "eccentric" skaters who go on the ice when it is
rotten. Lord JonN Manners justly complained that the Regent's
Park water was not treated properly, but was kept too shallow. How-
ever, making a row does good; for on Sunday night, as Mr. Punch
can state from personal observation with the aid of a cigar, water was
poured fiercely into the lake from that queer tube, which resembles a
gigantic old hat. But the supply soon stopped, and no good will be
done until there is a regular flow. Mr. T. Chamrers affirmed this,
and spoke well. Lord Galway rather implied that he himself bad
been drowned at some period in the course of his history, but we
rejoice to state that he appeared to be quite recovered. Mr. Hamdro
said that it would be as reasonable to fill up the ocean because a few
persons were drowned yearly, as to make the Serpentine safe for the
same reason. The weather is hot, but really we expect a little more
back-bone in argument.
Epping Forest is going to be disafforested. Somebody had better
look to this. It is a part of Waltham Forest—we have some idea that
our friend Mr. Anthony Trollope resides in that quarter. We
charge him with the duty of becoming a Vigilance Committee—we
could not nominate a better.
Wednesday. Mr. Taylor's Bill for abolishing the Game Laws was
abolished by 147 to 59. It is not a very good time to advocate such a
change, when men are counting days until the 12th of August. Go at
'em, Taylor, when the season is just over, and they are recalling bad
shooting and the insolent exactions of keepers.
Twice this week have strangers been turned out of the House, that
a proposal for doing away with a valuable measure of medical police
might be debated. This makes no difference to Mr. Punch, who is
Vol. LIX.—1870.
No. 1516.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
ent irely opposed to the said proposal, but does not consider it a subject
for discussion here. The agitators against the existing law deserve
harsher language than he ever uses without showing his justification,
and t hat would raise a topic which he is not shameless enough to
intrude on feminine attention, though they are.
Thursday. Some War intimations of no particular importance, save
a statement that the late Loro Clarendon, some time ago, endea-
voured to induce If ranee and Prussia to disarm, but nothing came of
his attempt. Both Powers undertake to respect the neutrality of
Belgium, Luxemburg, and Holland. No English officer is allowed to
be a newspaper correspondent during this war. Punch would like to
know why. An officer is a gentleman, and, having knowledge of the
art of war, would have his feelings aided by his judgment, in regard to
abstention from any communication that might injure the army which
he accompanied. However, British Journalism has never yet been
beaten by pedantry, and we have no doubt that we shall have the
campaign described with the accustomed exactitude of our newspapers.
Friday. Lord Carnarvon moved an Address designed to compli-
ment the Canadians on their noble conduct during the Fenian
"invasion," but after a discussion in which the handsomest things
were said, on all hands, about the gallant Colonists, the motion was
withdrawn. Lord Malmksrury found fault with its grammar. His
family correspondence, lately published by him, is a delightful book,
but he need not take to editing everybody.
Mu. Taylor had another Criminal's Grievance—a vagrant had been
flogged, and of course it was a case for the Imperial Parliament.
Mr. Bruce cited a heap of convict ions against the fellow, and did not
think that the justices had at all exceeded their jurisdiction. Why
could not Mr. Taylor, instead of making a fuss, have ascertained
what sort of a person was complaining P Because—but the answer
is obvious.
Hooray! The Education Bill was read a Third Time, and Passed.
But, as in classic days, a triumph was celebrated by a sacrifice. Mr.
Miall made a bitter speech against the Government, declaring that
the Dissenters had been "bitten," and that Mr. Gladstone had
thrown them over to please the Church. Whereupon, Mr. Gladstone,
rousing into such fervour as he has not lately exhibited, did seize his
biggest Rod, and did lay it upon Mr. Miall with such exceeding em-
phasis, that the House was awed at the spectacle of that Amazing
Flogging. He hoped that Mr. Miall would not continue his support
to the Government one moment longer than he thought it compatible
with his honour, and with the conscientious discharge of his duty:—
"For God's sake let him withdraw it when he thinks his doin? so will
serve the cause he has at heart. So long as he thinks fit to yield it, we
will co-operate with him for every purpose we hold in common, but when
we think his opinions and demands exacting, when we think he looks too
much to the section of the community which he adorns, and not to the entire
body of the nation, we must then recollect that we are the Government of the
Queen, and must have no mean, no narrow, no local object."
Never did Dr. Arnold, when castigating Tom Brown, administer
the educational process with more determined will and earnestness
to do his young friend good, and we hope that the lesson may be
hiessed to Mr. Miall, who has very much that is good in him. The
Sacrifice being accomplished, there was deserved compliment paid to
the fine temper and tact which Mr. Forster had displayed in
managing the Bill. Mr. Punch has already illustrated this in Cartoons
which will doubtless be the proudest ornaments of Mr. Forster's
picture-gallery—or smoking-room.
Dublin wants a statue to the brave Lord Gougti, and wi»he_s the
metal to be that of a few of the 1389 guns which he took from the
enemy. It was granted, but not in the most gracious way. Mr.
Maguire said that the Irish bad always been ready to fight for the
country, and would be ready again, but their spirit might be damped
when they heard of red tape obstacles to such a proposal as this. Mr.
Maguihe, Irishman, you say exactly what Mr. Punch, Englishman,
feels. More power to jour whiskey and water, if you drink that
beverage, and if you do, ice it.
The Gun Licence Bill passed, with some exceeding nonsense about
depriving Britons of defensive arms. "Of what use were civilised
institutions," justly asked Mr. Lowe,"if every man is to arm for
his defence P Nevertheless crime is by no means punished with
sufficient severity, and this ought to be done, if quiet men are to be
told that they must appeal to toe tribunals against ruffianism.
The Racing Bill was withdrawn, and then the House withdrew.
PROGRESS OF PLATFORM GOVERNMENT.
IieT us be joyful, joy-
ful!" for that whilst
the cause of Peace is
triumphing, as we see
it on the Continent of
Europe, thatof Liberty,
likewise, makes pro-
gress at home. The
amended" Wine and
Beerhouse Act, just
issued, provides that
"if any person be
found in a house re-
quired to be closed,
an officer may demand
the name and address
of such person, and if
it is refused, or a false
name or address given,
the party is to be liable,
onsummary conviction,
to a penalty not ex-
ceeding forty shillings;
and any person who,
when so required, re-
fuses or neglects to
give his name or ad-
dress may be appre-
hended by such con-
stable or officer, and
detained until he can
be brought before a Magistrate." Hooray! Liberty is the birthright of every
Englishman. Britons never will be slaves. Every Englishman's house (private
or public) is his castle. If on a hot excursion, or long walk, say between the hours
of three and five, on Sunday, you desire a glass of beer, you are at liberty to
procure one, subject to the necessity of giving information to a policeman which
will enable him to summon you before a Magistrate and get you fined.
Of course, this limitation of your ability to do as you please, so that you injure
nobody else, if imposed by the single occupant of a throne, would be absolute
tyranny; but when you are subjected to it merely by a majority of votes obtained
throngh assiduous agitation by declaimers on a platform, it is perfect freedom.
As Caliban sings, half-seas over, though not inside of any house "required to be
closed" by the law of his Island: —
"Freedom, heyday! Heyday, freedom! Freedom, freedom! Heyday, freedom!"

"VM V1CTIS."
War between France and Prussia declared at Paris—Dogma
of the Personal Infallibility of the Tope proclaimed at
Borne—July 15, 1870.
Two declarations of War we have known,
By two mighty potentates daringly hurled:
One a gage of defiance to Prussia thrown,
The other arresting the march of the World!
From the Tuileries this, from the Vatican that,
To astonish and anger all Europe, they came:

tion named in the following paragraph, which appeared
the other day in a newspaper :—
"Junior Gun Clur, Hendon.—The shooting for the third
club prize, value 60 guineas, with optional sweepstakes handicap
distances, 11 birds each, will commence at 4 o clock to-morrow
afternoon."
The lads who shoot for prizes of sixty guineas will doubt-
less be enabled to keep their guns, notwithstanding the
gun-tax. by rich and liberal papas or uncles who have
the ability and kindness to stand Sam. The birds at
which the members of the "Junior Gun Club" are in the
habit of shooting may be taken to be Cock-robins.

AN ODIOUS COMPARISON.
A Prussian Correspondent of the Times, carried away by his
Eatriotism, so far forgets the respect due to the great nation which
as attacked his country, as to write thus:— *
"Germany, at thin moment resembles an American settlement in the Far
West, where politicians of all shades of opinion waive their crotchets at the
cry, that the Indians are on the more."
It is true that, like Red Indians, the French are prone, on slight
provocation, to invade their neighbours' territories, despoil and slaughter
them, burn their dwellings, and subject those of whom they spare the
lives to treatment not prompted by the higher sentiments. But the
French do not dispose their hair in grotesque top-knots, nor wear war-
paint; neither in battle do they advance to the charge with absolute
war-whoops, but with loyal and patriotic cries of Five I'Empereur!"
and "Five la France!" Moreover, besides Chassepots and first-rate
artillery, including mitrailleuses, their weapons are sword-bayonets and
sabres, not tomahawks. And, whatever they are in the habit of doing
to their conquered enemies, they are not accustomed to scalp them.
Nor can it be denied that the pretty Frenchwomen are in every respect
entirely the reverse of sqnaws. The angry and outraged Germans,
suffering, however, outrage only in their turn, must admit, on cool
reflection, that the French are, in many respects, superior to the Sioux
and the Chickasaws. And, when they compare their present assailants
to savages, they should not forget Schleswig-Holstein.
Promotion of Single Blessedness.
The enactment of the Married Women's Property Bill will surely
decrease the number of marriages into which women are wheedled by
men who only want their money. It will be interesting to measure the
diminution which will accordingly soon be visible in the newspaper
lists of " Marriages."
ANTICIPATED HARVEST.
A report in the Post, from the Camp at Wimbledon, contains the
following entry :—
"Sunday Evening.
"This morning the Bev. Me. Fahrer, Master at Harrow, conducted
divine service in the large Umbrella Tent, and preached a most effective
sermon from the 34th verse of the 14th chapter of Proverbs: 'Righteousness
exalteth a nation.1"
Let us hope the reporter will prove a true prophet. Of course, the
effect of the reverend gentleman's discourse remains to be seen. At
present it can only be prospectively effective. When it does take
effect, we shall see a happy diminution in the number of fraudulent
bankers and directors of swindling bubble companies going to smash;
also, in that of shopkeepers convicted of adulterating their com-
modities, and using false weights and measures. Our national right-
eousness, attended with exaltation, may soon become manifest. Then
the effect of Mr. Farrer's sermon at Wimbledon will be visible; but,
as yet, it hath not appeared.
To Miss Dorothy.
Female! When I behold your skirt.
Draggling behind you in the dirt,
How pleased and thankful, too, am I
That I have not your clothes to buy!
HUMANITY O? THE PROVOST-MARSHAL.
The Paris Correspondent of a contemporary learns that "great
precautions will be exercised towards strangers hanging about the
army." One, we suppose, will be the precaution of giving them plenty
of rope.

THE WISDOM OF PARLIAMENT.
Spraking for the House of Commons, the other even-
ing, the Chancellor op the Exchequer very truly said
that "they were the objects of public compassion for their
late hours and long speeches." Two proverbs are sug-
gested by this remark. One of them assigns a distinctive
appellation to the kind of persons who are notorious for
loquacity. The quotation of it is forbidden in Joseph
Andretcs, by Mr. Adams. The other averreth that:—
"Early to bed, and early to rise,
Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."
Accordingly the excellence of our sanitary arrangements,
and the smallness of our pauperism, may be regarded as
indicative of the amount of wisdom with which we, en-
joyiug a representative Legislature, are governed.
CANNONADE AT ROME.
Pre-arrangements have been made for demonstrations
of triumph at Rome on the proclamation of the Crowning
Dogmr. Among these are to be salutes of artillery. The
Pope's Infallibility will probably be proclaimed amid the
roar of cannon other than his Prescience ever contem-
plated. So much for Peace on Earth. It is remarkable
that Ultramontanes should consider the discharge of ord-
nance suitable to the announcement that his Holiness Has
been voted infallible. Only Ultra-Protestants, one would
imagine, could possibly think such a solemnity fitly cele-
brated by the noise of murderous weapons of war, inasmuch
as war is anti-christian. Marry, an Elizabethan jester, if

THE WARNING BY THE WAY.
We poise our balanced periods; we point our obvious morals;
Ring the familiar changes on the horror of armed quarrels;
Rub up our tarnished metaphors—the bolt out of the blue—
The avalanche brought down by a word—the dyke by a stroke cut
through 1
Trot out the old abstractions—Justice and Mercy flying;
Humanity called from its work to attend the maimed and dying;
Industry, ill-used giant, beating ploughshares into swords;
Peace and Progress trampled underfoot beneath War's hurrying hordes.
Until we come to realise the huge and hideous fact—
Two million costly soldiers attacking and attacked!
Europe's two master races, the Teuton and the Gaul,
Must ring for the death-grapple to the shattering trumpet-call.
Before such grim reality our rhetoric vails its crest:
Our loudest preachers feel at heart that silence fitteth best:
We pack up our stale maxims, push our periods aside,
Leave our abstractions on their pegs, our obvious morals hide,
And bow before the inscrutable, and do our best to hold
Our minds in even balance 'twixt new loves and hatreds old.
Painfully to weigh causes, and trace fruits back to their seed,
In Napoleon's hopes and fears or in Prussia's grasp and greed.
Hard to hold even temper 1 To resist the German blood.
Which beats and bounds within us in a fever-heated flood,
At the words of weight and wisdom, the appeals to God above,
That e'en the slow brain of Berlin to patriot passion move.
Hard to recall the wrath we felt on Duppel's shameful day,
When overmatched, at Prussia's feet robbed Denmark bleeding lay!
Before this blaze of brotherhood that, as fire bids metals run,
Fuses North Germany and South, and East, and West, in one.
Hard not to feel the ancient grudge across our judgments come,
That has now for centuries rankled 'twixt John Bull and Jacques
Bonhomme:
Hard not to see the blood-stains that will keep soaking through
The pages of our annals from Crecy to Waterloo.
Hard not to think of him who made French Empire once so wide;
Whose red star rose in Corsica, in St. Helena died!
Who reaped war's whirlwind harvest, as war's wind of woe he
sowed,
And was dashed to death by the tempest which he loosed and once
o'er-rode.
Hard not to call up the shadow of the Uncle, grim and grey,
With a hand upraised in warning across the Nephew's way I
With eyes that look their lesson, lips that warn without a word—
How they that draw the sword to smite shall perish by the sword.
Unlike the Uncle until now, in all but name of power,
Will the Nephew tempt the Uncle's fate—in this his evening hour P
Stand aside, grim, grey spectre, let him pass on his way:
Thou mean'st 'tis death for him to advance—what is it, if he stay P
Think'st thou he rides for pleasure this road to the battle-field.
And the boy he loves beside him, with his father's heart for shield P
He does but ride because he must; to bring the eagle prey,
Lest, if he feed it not, from his boy it rend the Crown away.
He has reared a mighty army, for his boy that Crown to guard,
And if that army murmur, he must find it its reward—
In the chances of the battle, the prizes of the strife.
The plunder, and promotion that gild the soldier's life.
Then stand aside! Thy warning may be well-meant, but behind
Retreat is barred by spectres, as ghastly and less kind.
There 'a the Liberty he murdered; there are the Oaths he broke:
France, that cries Give me conquest, ip I must rear the yoke."

NOTES FROM A VOLUNTEER'S DIARY, 1870
March.—Suggestive month for military. Determine to become a
Volunteer, and go in for firing. Friend 6ays, " Why not win a cup P"
Certainly. Why notP Friend says, Go in for the five hundred yards
[ business. It appears I can do it—that is, I can try to do it—in three
i positions, standing up, kneeling, or lying at full length, not on my back,
j The third he says is easier than it looks. Hope so. Besides in war, be
j c.h-ierves, it's more useful, as the shots go over you instead uf
through you. Looking at it in this light, this position certainly has its
1 advantages.
| llire a field to practise in, by myself. Get other Volunteers, from
the village, (the little tailor, the small farmer, and the general dealer's
assistant) to come down and shoot every morning, six sharp. Wc find
six, iu March, peculiaily sharp.
! April, May, June.—Nothing particular, except practising every day,
and once winging the hat of the man at the butt, who becoming en-
thusiastic, bad looked out to see how the shooting was going on without
waving his flag first.
Juue 2nd made a centre.
June 3rd made another. The rest nowhere. Shall look out list of
prizes at 500 yards for lying down, standing, or kneeling competitors.
Ask a friend who knows all about it. What should he advise me to go
i in for f He says he 'II jot down two or three for me. What do 1 think,
I for example, of the Belgian Nursery Cup P Well, 1 think it's very
i.ice. Only( am I qualified P And if qualified, what does it mean t
j He doesn't know, but supposes that the Belgian Nursery Cup can only
be shot for by Belgian Infantry. I ask him to be serious, because if 1
do win a cup, it's a sort of thing that remains in one's family as an
| heirloom. Should like to have an heirloom. Can imagine descendants
having it out after dinner and saying, this is what my great-great-
grandfather (with a picture of ine over the dining-room mantelpiece, in
uniform) won at Winib'edon. "Why not," he says, "go in for the
Bass Prize P" Any qualification necessary P I ask. "Yes," he replies,
I "you must be able to pint your gun." Hate a fellow who turns every-
thing into joke. Decide upon buying a programme-book of the meeting
and choosing the prize I'1l shoot for. The Running Deer seems to me
a good notion. (I regret having thus expressed myself to my friend,
who is instantly upon me with, " Yes, the Running Deer is a very
good i-deer." Idiot! and if you laugh you encourage him.)
Decide at last upon going in for the Daily Telegraph Prize, the
Windmill Prize, and the Running Deer.
Condition of the above.—500 yards in any position.
Think I shall practise sitting as being less fatiguing.
I practise in every position three times a day, and make centres.
The village comes out to see me, like the opening chorus in Der Frei-
irhiitt. The sporting publican, however, oners to "back the Wimble-
don butts," which is a trifle discouraging. Hear (from the little tailor
when he's "measuring " me for a Volunteer cloak) that the sporting
publican intends to make a good thing out of my shooting. "Laying
agen you, Sir," he explains, cheerfully. I advise little tailor to back
his Captain (me) for the honour generally of old England. Little
tailor says," he would if he were a betting man, which he ain't."
The Day — Leave my happy home at Pinnyhoe, in the Downs, for
Clapham Junction. After some deliberation (while getting up) decide
upon not wearing full Captain's uniform, with sword, but only plain
tunic and forage cap. Neat and unassuming if I don't win the Tele-
graph Cup, or the Windmill Prize, or miss the Running Deer. Beside,
if there's any difficulty, I've only to present my card with Rank and
Corps engraved to get me a pass anywhere. 'Pon my word, it is a
grand noble thing for England and Englishmen this Volunteer system.
All grand devoted fellows.
Only one trap at station, and four Volunteers wanting to take it. I
am the fifth. The "grand devoted fellows" are in some dark green and
red uniform, and are the scrubriest lot (that is a lot wanting a great
deal of scrubbing) I ever saw. But what of the outside shell P Or to
put it Volunteerlv and professionally, what of the Shell-jacket P—the
man's the kernel within. (Keep this as a motto for our regiment, which,
when the day's work is done, I shall announce amidst shouts of ap-
plause around our merry camp-fire to-night.) We fraternise and jog
up iu the trap together to the Camp. Share and share alike is fair, and
this is real brotherhood, for I've never seen any of 'em before. N.B.
Since noting the above, I may add, that I've never seen any of 'em
again. They jumped out directly the fly was pulling up by the entrance
to the Camp, and ran away. The flyman is off his box in a second, and
most insolent. I explain to him that they are nothing to me, that I am
not responsible for them, that in fact, here is my share; but he won't
listen to reason (mine), and is becoming violent. I appeal to a sta-
tionary policeman. He hears the case (judicially), and says he can't
interfere. I must pay the man. Pay him indignantly, and promise to
report the whole affair at head-quarters. Haven't the smallest notion
where "head-quarters" are, but have a sort of notion that I should
get some luncheon there, if I could find them.
See no one I know. Officials at gate demur to my entrance without
fiaying. I protest, exhibiting my uniform. They say it's not a uni-
orm; it'sundress: it might be anybody's. Show my card. Won't
do. Must pay. I pay, and threaten to report this also to head-quarters.
Wish I could find head-quarters. Ask, and am directed to the refresh-
ment tent. Will go there presently. Hear firing in various directions.
Ask where the Pinnyhoe men are to shoot. No one knows. Advised
to buy a book about the shooting, published by Authority and Spiers
and Pond. Apparently more of Spiers and Pond in it than Authority.
Sit on a tub, an isolated Volunteer, and read it.
Notes on the Publication.—The motto for Volunteers is Sit perpetuum,
which seems singularly inappropriate for men who are expected to
fire in any position, and to he always on the move.
The book refers me to a " plan of ground" for my guidance. This
I find in a pocket in the binding. Where am I now P There is a
place marked "gravel-pit." I am not in the gravel-pit. The tub on
which 1 am sealed is not down as a landmark. It's very badly
managed. There ought to be polite officials to walk about, and ask
Volunteers, specially officers, where they'd like to go to P
Inspect the plan again. There is a " windmill" and a "lavatory."
From the tub 1 can see neither. Let me see, here are " North ranges"
marked down. Which is North, and which is Soutti ?—Note. To buy a
pocket compass. Can't tell by the wind or by the Sun. Ought to be
able, but can't.
Here is "Grand Stand" on the plan. Not the tub certainly.
Ah! here is a first-rate point to guide myself by. "Centre of
Weathercock on Square Tower!" What a capital butt this woulil
make. Centre of Weathercock! Can't see it anywhere. Wish 1
hadn't come. Can't go back without firing a shot, at something, or
some one. Getting hungry. Walking from the tub I find myself
between the Police camp and the Restaurants.
Enter the Restaurants for luncheon. To hot waiter, " What can I
have P" Waiter stops for one second to glance at my dress, and then
replies mechanically, "Volunteers in uniform are entitled to a small
plate of beef, or ham, and tea," and hurries off to attend other orders.
I will have what I ain entitled to with the exception of tea, which 1
propose to exchange for mild ale and ginger beer or Bass's pale.
Somehow or another I find ou finishing that 1 have run into Break-
fast 3>, and Bass 6d, besides the small plate to which Volunteers are
entitled. Waiter differs from me as to my being in uniform. I want
to refer the nutter to Spiers and Pond, or Spiers alone, or Pond
without Spiers. Altercation ends by my giving him an extra sixpence
to put me straight for the place where the Telegraph is to be shot for.
On the Spot—Will I stand, or sit, or kneel, or lie down P Choose
kneeling. Butt five hundred yards off. Seems to be a longer five
hundred than I've been practising at at Pinnyhoe.
Officers to fire first, I believe. Am not recognised as an officer, not
being in full uniform. Absurd. They don't call me Captain. Wish
some of my own men were here, or anyone whom I knew, and who
knows what 1 am when at home.
Two shots allowed first to get the right sight. Der Freischiilz again.
The bullets are not charmed. Hope number three shot will be better
than the two to get the correct sight, as where they went to it is im-
possible to say. No one is hurt at present; but it strikes me that
Pinnyhoe is nowhere. Thinking of the sporting publican, I should be
inclined to back the butts myself, and make money by it. Odd! when
at home 1 've been making centres every day for the last month.
First genuine shot. Just before this, man puis me out by entangling
himself somehow in the distance with the danger signal. I fire. No
effects.
Rain begins to drizzle. Curious that at home I should never have
thought of shooting in the rain. Always went in when it rained.
Quite unsettled: missed again. Also at home I never shot after a
small plate of beef and Bass. Makes all the difference. Give it up and
retire: say I feel a little dizzy. Think I'1l visit the Running Deer.
The Running Deer is out of order and can't move. Sorry for this, as
I fancy I could have done something here. More rain. Harder.
Pelting. No chance of camp-fires and all the jollifications of war
which one reads of in Lever's books, with doctors telling racy stories
and Irish Captains making sporting bets. 1 will take my rifle and go.
Swear 1 put down my rifle close by me not a minute ago, when I was
talking to some one about the centres 1 'd been making at Pinnyhoe.
Can't find it anywhere. Can't go about the Camp asking everyone if
they've seen a rifle that doesn't belong to them. Raining harder than
ever. Shall get back to train and go home. Shan't go again. It 's
absurd after all making Volunteering a sort of pigeon-shooting affair.
Shall set my face against it. Shan't go again: except with a party
and all in full uniform. Give up idea of handing down silver-cup to
descendants. Home. Meet sporting publican next day. He says he
heard of me at Wimbledon. Think I ve gone down in the estimation
of my Corps. Bad, this, for an officer.
Stay—1 know: I '11 give 'em all a dinner, and go up again in their
estimation. Day settled, and to be given at the sporting publican's
house.
Note.—Since the invitations have been issued, applications to be
enlisted in my Corps are coming in every hour.

One very hot day this summer a passenger was travel-

was Sidcup. On leaving the train he was heard to express
a wish that it had been Cidercup.
SHABBY AFFAIRS.
Mr. Punch, Sir,
You approve, I am happy to observe, in your waluable journal,
of the good old maxim "Live and let live." Now then. What do you
say to the crusade wich the Pall Mall Gazette say " we are glad to see"
have been got up among certain parsons "to render funerals less costly
and conventional than they have hitherto been P" The ringleader of
these reverend parties, 1 understand from the Pall Mall, is the Vicar
of Stratford-on-Avon, and I suppose it's him as is named by that dis-
agreeable paper when it states tnat :—
"The special objects which Mr. CoiLia has in view are the reduction of
the expense and pomp of funerals by providing a bier and pall for the poor,
and by declining to receive gloves, scarves, and hatbands; by discouraging
funeral feasts, which are a heavy tax on the poor, and discountenancing the
use of the ridiculous trappings which are thoroughly out of place at such
seasons."
I know what I should say if I was Mr. Punch to sitch a despiseable
attempt to take the bread out of the mouths of respectable individuals.
"Shabby!" That's the word. It describes exactly just what a
funeral would be without gloves, and scarfs, and at bands. No plumes,
a reduction now too generally pursu'd, is mean enough, and show a
contemptuous want of proper respect; but to dock off sitch trifiin
tributes of isteem and afexion as a few pares of gloves and yards of
black crape! It isn't respectable. And what makes such stingey
begerly objections to reasonable expense the more ridiclous is that
under the feelins of berievement economy never ain't no objict with
sorowin relatives, who wery often benefits by a ansome legacy into the
Bargain.
No, Sir, "Live and let live," as you justly observe, and allow me to
make the fittle addition " Die and let live," hallso, and don't have no pit-
tyful and indecent curs tailment of the usialobsequidges. Trusting the
wealthy, who can well afford them, will never set the base exampel of
cuttin' of 'em down, I remain, Sir, yours till death, and arterwards too, if
employed by the friends, Mutus Mumm.
'Elm Grove,
HOW TO ROLL YOUR ROADS.
We learn from a Report on the Economy of Road-mending, lately
made by that Colossus of Roads, Mr. Paget, that the using of steam-
rollers saves fifty per cent., at least, in merely the expense for broken
stones alone." This is, in itself, a valuable economy: but, besides
the saving in broken stones alone, who will estimate the value of the
saving, by smooth roadways, of broken springs, and battered wheels,
and injured horses' feet, and jolted bones, and shaken nerves of
creatures who are even more valuable than horses?
Mr. Paget further tells us that:—
"Merely in the consumption of granite the ratepayers of London would
save £140,000 a year by the universal use of steam-rollers."
As the Vestrymen of London have the mending of the roads, this
argumentum ad pockctum is a proper one to use; for it is of little use
appealing to the feelings of a Vestryman. Perhaps, though, if some
Vestrymen were suddenly indicted for cruelty to animals, both human
and equine, occasioned by the sharp stones which arc strewn uncrushed
upon the roadways, they might begin to listen to the voice of reason,
which, by the mouth of Mr. Punch, has advocated constantly the use
of cheap steam-rollers, in lieu of costly carriage-wheels, for making a
smooth road,

THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.
Our order of proceeding through Rotterdam, is Jomp first, with the
Commodore's carpet-bag, containing (especially) Murray and Bradshaw.
Then the Secretary, then Maullie in his celebrated hat with his
weapons, sketch-book and pencil, in hand, "taking bits," lastly, the
Count (Gooch) lagging well in the rear, afraid to lose sight of us
entirely, but attempting to appear as if the assertion that we had any
sort of connection with him (as advertisements say) was "an untrades-
manlike falsehood."
Our progress is slow, as we are pulled up every five minutes by
Maullie, exclaiming "Hah!" then he pauses, shades his eyes with
his hand, compresses his lips, critically, shakes his head at the antique
house, as much as to say, You 're a sly old chap, you are, to be hidden
away here in this manner;" then he opens the book and flourishes the
pencil, and in another three minutes he has "taken the bit," and our
halt has attracted a small company of little Dutch street-boys and
a few loafers.
Gooch is utterly disgusted, and stands aloof, looking in at a shop
window.
Jomp has to clear away the crowd.
"Confound it," Gooch complains to me, " You know, they think
we 're going to perform, and do conjuring. It's all through Matfllie's
hat,—and—hang it—they think all our tricks, and cups and balls
are in that carpet-bag of Bund's. 'Pon my soul, it's too bad. It only
wants a board and a bit of carpet to complete it."
Jomp, a perfect Irvingite in the matter of unknown tongues, some-
how manages to explain to the little Dutch boys, that we are not going
to give a performance of any sort, and we resume our progress.
The Commodore's one object in Rotterdam is to find out the statue
of Erasmus. Gooch, who has dressed himself as if to walk in Hyde
Park, and is suffering from the heat and the wretched pavement, says,
"Hang Erasmu8!" Maullie asks where the Picture Galleries are P
These two questions being put to Jomp, that well-informed person
stops, takes off his hat (the livery one, which is as hard as a police-
man's, and as hot as the glazed one worn by voituriers in Patis) per-
forms a sort of extempore shampooing operation with a faded brown
cotton pocket handkerchiet (" Hang it," says the Count, "I '11 get him
a new one") and having " brought it out," replies deliberately, "Veil,
um—um—um—oh yes—there's de statue of Rasums"—this is what
"Erasmus" comes to in Jomp's dialect. "Yes—oh yes—it's here,"
which we know, "but where?" asks the Commander becoming
a little irritable.—"Veil, I'1l demand—oh, yes—they'll tell me"
—as if this was a profound secret not generally divulged by the
Rotterdammers, "and—de Picture galleries—oh yes—You can see
dem—um—um—um," here he thinks it out again, and makes a safe
proviso—" if dere are any."
"I thought you said," exclaims the Count to Bund, " that Jomp
knew this place very well."
"He told me he'd been here before," replies the Commodore,
evading the responsibility;—then to Jomp, You have been here
before, ehf"
"Oh, yes," replies Jomp, indignantly, "Oh, yes—been here before
—but I never stop."
This confession compels Bund to have recourse to Murray. To get
at Murray he has to open the bag, remove Bradshaw/ two hair-brushes,
an old comb, an Eau-de-Cologne bottle, a pair of slippers, and a port-
able boot-jack. On the appearance of this last article, Gooch makes a
final protest—" Out in the open air—oh 'pon my soul! —it's—it's "—
and being unable to find words sufficiently strong to express his
disgust, he walks away from us and saunters along, as if he was
utterly blase, and had seen it all scores of hours before, the Boompje, by
the side of a canal.
At this rate we don't get on very fast through Rotterdam. Presently
Bund cries out (he is sitting on a post, studying the Guide Book) to
Maullie, who is taking a bit, "What do you think Murray says f"
"Don't know," returns Maullie, placing his pencil horizontally
across the bridge of his nose, and grinning at an imaginary vanishing
point.
"He says," continues the Commodore, quoting—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[July 30, 1870.
"' Oae day will suffice to see all that is remarkable in Rotterdam.'"
"Ob," says M »cllir, in a tone of utter indifference.
"Is there nothing to seeP" says Gooch, who has sauntered back
again on seeing Murray returned to the bag, and the bag once more
in Jomp's hands.
"See P Yes!" cries Maullie, enthusiastically, shutting up his
sketch-book with a click. "SeeP lots. I could spend weeks here.
Isn't there a tower or something to go up and get a view from P"
If there are no picture-galleries, Maullie invariably wants "to go
up somewhere and get a view." To boompje up a hundred and twenty-
five steps gives quite a fresh lease of life to Maullir.
Gooch says, languidly, "Good heavens! if you want to do that sort
of thing, why didn't you stop in town or go up the Monument." He
complains (he is always presenting gravamina to me; privately) that to
go up towers and belfries is "such a regular British tourist sort of
thing."
"Let's go to a restaurant's," the Count, proposes.
Compromise.—Tower first, restaurant afterwards. In the meantime
(while we're up the tower) J 6 MP to go and order luncheon. "Not
luncheon," says Gooch in despair, dejeuner a la fourchette, a ton
llet, par exemple, and be sure to order hort iF ceneres, des radis, des
sardines, you know; JSmp; no confounded English things." And
Jomp departs on his errand, taking with him, thank Heaven, says
Gooch, after he's well out of sight, that boompje carpet-bag
of Bund's.
On quilting the tower, from the summit of which we certainly have,
a wonderful view (about which Maullib cross-questions the guide
who shows us over the place, while the Commodore, who will trust no
information except Murray's, listens to him with the air of a man not
to be taken in in this sort of way), we walk towards the restaurant,
Bund stopping Maullie to draw his attention to what he considers
picturesque (a tender of opinion immediately resented by Maullie
who likes to choose for himself), the Secretary noting down the bright
brass milk-pails, the Turks' heads, open-mouthed, over the druggists'-
doors (as if always ready for physic), and the costumes of the women,
with their wonderful spiral ear-rings, arranged on a startling boompje
principle, apparently to shoot out suddenly and hit you, and looking
very much as if the Dutch women had extracted the springs from
small Palmer's patent candle-lamps, and polished 'em up into
something resembling ornaments for their ears.
Mem. All the children lovely; grown-up people, plain.
At the Restaurant.—Goocn complains it isn't like Paris: more like
Leicester Square. He hopes Jomp has ordered some dish peculiar to
the oountry.
"Oh, yes," says Jomp, " I have commanded a—a—a "(Here he
thinks it out, and continues—" a—a—vol they 'ave got."
Enter waiter with large dish, followed by another waiter with
smaller dish. Cover removed. Exclamation (Boompje!) from Gooch,
"A rump'/eak and potatoes! Oh, confound it! Why the Boompje"
(to Jomp, who stands by, smiling, with an air of intense satisfaction)
"couldn't you order a dish of the country P"
"Veil," returns Jomp, hurt, "dis is from de country. De cote is in
de country, and de potatoes in de country."
Agreed nem. con., for the fourth time, that Jomp is an ass. "And
no horsd'atuvres!" says Gooch, almost in tears.
"Oh, yes," says Jomp, triumphantly, "I command them, but there
are none."
Some capital light wine, and plenty of ice, restores us, and we again
take to the Hoogstrast (High Street).
Note,—Dutch inscriptions. We notice "Koffy Ilaus " and " Kaffy,"
too, as if they had not yet made up their minds how to settle the
spelling. "Slytcry Tappery " is very popular, and Hollandsche Snoor-
weg is far from occasional. It is satisfactory to (" satisfactory " looks
like a Dutch word, so do " lottery " and "pottery ") know that
"Agentschasse der Sliedrechlsche stoorm steep maalschoffij Haartnijder
Bcschcn 'en kleingoed."
Also« "Foot nat en drukken bewarren,"
And "Eel is verboden de lots of things."
"Heavens !" says Gooch, "Fancy being in a place where' hel is
verboden to slytery tappery!' He makes this remark on some notice
not unlike the above, stuck up in a picture-gallery (not here, but at
Amsterdam), which he subsequently finds means that visitors are
requested not to put their sticks and umbrellas through the pictures.
(At least we conclude that to be the idea.)
Dinner at the Hotel.—Bright idea of Gooch's. He knows what to
ask for. Of course the dish of the country. What P Why—fancy not
having thought of it before—of course, water-zootje! I suggest
souchet. The Commodore thinks it's zouchy. Maullie says he doesn't
know, but should say water-zootje, inclining to Gooch's opinion.
Jomp summoned. Does he know if there is any water-tootje t
"Veil," says Jomp, "perhaps there i»." He discovers his utter
ignorance of what we mean by offering to find out for us vera it is.
"What do you mean—' where it is P" says Bund, sternly. He is
responsible for Jomp, and is beginning to feel that he mustn't be trifled
with.
"Veil—nm—run," Jomp explains, "vere it is—vot part of de town
he is in."
"Water-zootje is something to eat, you—you Boompje!" cries
Gooch.
"Ah!" returns Jomp, with an incredulous smile, thinking he is
being chaffed, "you can ask."
So the waiter enters. "Now," says Bund, shifting the authority on
to the Count's shoulders, "you order what you want."
All eyes on the Count: the waiter deeply attentive.
"Have you," iuquires Gooch, with the air of a barrister who 'II get
something out of the witness before he's done with him—" Have you
any vater-zootje P"
"Vater "the waiter murmurs, puzzled.
"Water-zootje, you know," says Gooch.
"Vater-zootje" Maullir tries, with a feeble attempt at Dutch.
The waiter looks at Jomp. Jomp shrugs bis shoulders, and smiles
helplessly, as much as to say, " You see they will have their joke,"
which irritates Gooch almost beyond endurance. Then the waiter,
evidently entering into Jomp's view of the matter, also smiles and
shakes his head, as if we really were too funny for him.
"But, confound it!" exclaims Gooch, "don't you know your own
dishesP Why, it's a regular Dutch dish—always have it at Green-
wich "(Waiter and Jomp shrugging and smiling, Commodore and
Maullie anxious.) "Here, I '11 write it down "He writes it
down. "Now," he resumes, triumphing in this effort of ingenuity,
"what's thatP"
The waiter inspects it, so does Jomp.
"Well," says Gooch, impatiently, "don't you know it P Haven't
yon got it P Water-zootje, eh P Your own national dish!"
The waiter, still under the impression that he is the victim of a weak
practical joke, replies, "No, never 'eard of eat," and retires with
Jomp.
Agreed, nem. con., stupid idiots! Don't know their own dishes.
The usual foreign dinner follows—roas beef, &c. No hors d'eeueres,
no salad. Capital champagne, however, well iced, restores equanimity.
After dinner Gooch lights cigarettes. Maullie sleeps. Bund to
Commodore reads aloud extracts from Murray, and the Secretary
makes notes.
Bund, finding it dull, regrets he didn't bring his violoncello, and
requests me to note that there is no music in Rotterdam. If we stop
any time in one place (Bund throws this out as a suggestion), he thinks
he '11 hire a violoncello. (Boompje!)
PAYING YOUR SHOT.
GROUSE SHOOTING.—A GTO to be LET, on a first-class Moor,
with Board, &c. Unexceptionable references will be required.
Was it necessary to incur the expense of an advertisement in Ofi
Times to announce to the sporting world that there was " a gun to he
let," P It is not needful to go to distant moors to hire that article.
In London alone there must be a large number of respectable shops
willing, for a consideration, to let out fire-arms, without requiring
"references" "unexceptionable " or otherwise. But perhaps publicity
has been given to this particular gun, because it has, apparently, the
unusual recommendation of including "board, &c," whereas the
ordinary weapon only includes powder, shot, &c. P

THE DEAD SHOT AT DOVES.
I call it hard labour to carry a gun
Out shooting for hours in the beat of the son,
Through stubble, and turnips, or heather to stride,
To sialic the broad acres and scale the hill-side,
In velveteen, fustian, or shepherd's plaid suits,
And coarse leather gaiters and clodhopping boots.
You'1l never catch me beating cover or moor,
Exertion like that I consider a bore.
The thought of my cheeks and brow streaming and red
Appals me with horror, o'erwhelms me with dread:
Perspire like a navvy whom work has made hotP
Get tanned as a carter does P Much rather not.
No; give me the Scrnbbs, or a smooth-shaven lawn,
And pigeon in trap, with a cord to be drawn;
No dogs to toil after, but cool and serene,
Kid-gloved and glazed-booted, place me on the green,
Before my box, posted in turn at the scratch,
A concourse assembled to witness our match.
The daughters of Fashion in brilliant array,
Beholders, their dresses and graces display.
To transport excited I feel, while I blaze,
Tbe object admired of their languishing gaze.
With both barrels cocked, in position, eyes right,
Oh, then, I enjoy a true sportsman's delight!
Out flutters the pigeon when pulled is the string;
Bang, bang! and I "tailor," or "rake" him and wing.
The odds of the betting run high on my skill,
Unless I but cripple more doves than 1 kill.
The ladies applaud my precision of aim;
Next morning my prowess the papers proclaim.
Crack shots there are many that love a battue;
And that is great sport with small trouble, 'tis true.
But, like pigeon-shooting, no shooting can please
A gentleman liking to shoot at his ease,
Of killing, because he prefers the mere fun—

THE CENSUS.
A People's Bill, the Census Bill, has been passing through
littee in the House of Commons. Members tried to enlarge its i
Com-
mittee in the House of Commons. Members tried to enlarge its scope,
and make the information it is to produce rather more amusing;
but not with much success, the House rejecting proposals to persuade
us all, on a certain day in the month of April next, to confide to the
Rrgistrar General to what religious community we belong; whether
we have married oar first cousin; how many rooms there are without
windows in our house, &c.
It appears to Mr. Punch that an excellent opportunity of obtaining a
large mass of valuable statistical facts, bearing on the prosperity and
national resources of the country, is likely to be lost for another ten
years; and he, therefore, suggests to the House of Lords the pro-
priety of their introducing into the Bill, when it comes before them,
some such list of questions as the following, the answers to which
would prove far more interesting than mere commonplace everyday
details of name, age, sex, profession, or occupation, relation to head of
family, &c.:—
1. Are you engaged P
2. What tooth-powder do you use P
3. Does your mother-in-law reside under your roof; and do you find
his arrangement conducive to domestic happiness P

THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.
STILL IN ROTTKKIHM—GOOCH'S RAILWAY TIME —BOOMPJE
NOTES—FAREWELL TO THE BOOMPJES—THE HAGUE-THE
GALLERY—TWO FRIENDS.
Gooch is peculiarly slow. It
is through Gooch that we
alwajs manage to "run the
starting rather fine," as he ex-
presses it afterwards.
He is utterly uuableto con-
sider himself as a man slow in
his movements. When he
wants to give you an idea of
his going to be some con-
siderable time (during which,
specially before breakfast, you
are implored by hira not to
wait for him) he will ask yuu
to " call it," or "say twenty
minutes." This is how he
wishes others to compute
time, by "making it" or "call-
ing it, or " saying" so many
minutes. He seldom runs
into hours. When he does
this, if it's an appointment,
you may depend upon either
not seeing him at all, or on his
turning up in a week or two,
and proudly saying, "There
you see, I said 1 'd come, and
here I am!"
For instance, he is not out
of bed, he has (by conse-
quence) not had his bath, he
has to pack his portmanteau,
and have his breakfast.
"Well," says Bund, the Commander at the door," how long will
you be, eh P" "Oh," answers Gooch, from within, under the sheets
probably, and the door craftily locked, " about a quarter of an hour,
or" he adds, as if wishing to be particular to a second, and not
inconvenience anyone by so much as a lite seconds' delay, "say
twenty minutes, and I'm there."
We say twenty minutes, and, of course, he is not there.
If be wishes to give us a notion of how quick he will be, when,
for instance, we want him to come and see some privately-collected
picture gallery which is conveniently open at eleven and closed at
twelve (on account of the private collector's family dinner), and Gooch
has three letters which he has invariably got to "finish "—(not to
write, oh no, that would be too long and tedious a proceeding—he

appears to keep a lot always by him half written, as Maullie has some
three or four pictures always on the stocks ")—he says he will come
"before you can wiuk your eye."
This is his formula for his own rapidity:—
He'1l be dressed before you can wink your eye.
He'1l put on his hat before you can wink your eye.
He'll come to you (he sends this by telegram a hundred miles off)
before you can wink your eye.
After this, it is almost unnecessary to state that we find Gooch to be
at least three-quarters of an hour dressing, and a trifle under that—
not much—in washing his hands.
Goocii's watch is invariably set with "railway time." This he will
give with an air of authority, which is convincing at first. After
missing the train three times, in consequence of adhering closely to his
(Gooch's) watch, we begin to mistrust him, and prefer Jump's chrono-
meter, which takes us down to any station at least an hour before the
traiu starts.
Gooch's exclusive possession of " railway time" (no one else's watch
ever coincides with his, and he generally manages to correct other
statements and come in last, authoritatively) is peculiarly Boompje-ish.
He announces it as a fact, by which you may take warning or not, how
it's for your own advantage or not; but that's all one to him, and he
pities you, if you don't. He is also consistent, a great point in Boomp-
jeism: for when we arrive at the station, hardly by his time, and the
train has gone, he refers us to the railway clock as being in accordance
with his watch, in which case he at first asserts that the train cant
have gone; and, on bearing that it has, threatens the ticket-taker in
the pigeon-hole that he will write to the directors; or, if the station
clock flatly contradicts him (which is very rare) be appeals to us (gene-
rally to me) to corroborate his statement of the agreement of his watch
with that of the last station we were at yesterday.
After travelling with him for some time, we prefer Jomp's time to
Gooch's; but end by striking a balance between the two, and then
generally having half an hour to the good.
I once saw a ballet, or musical piece, called The Dancing Barber.
The chief character was dressed in a very closely fitting suit of sables,
not a bit like a barber, and he wore a cocked hat. I mention this
because Gooch reminded me of it in Rotterdam, where, when anyone
is dangerously ill, the relatives send round a couple of these dancing
barbers, in black, with funereal weepers to their cocked bats, who go
about like two bogies, ringing at the doors, delivering cards, and
frightening (I should think) little Hutch children into fits. (Boomp-je!)
Mm-i.i,ik proposes that, before going on to the Hague, we should
visit Dort. The Commodore assures him that there's nothing to be
seen at Dort except windmills.
M w i.i.i k retorts, that lie likes windmills.
Gooch yawns on a sofa, and says, "Do let's go to the Hague.
There's civilisation there. I say!" he exclaims suddenly, turning to
Maullir, " there's a palace and swell shops there: you might get a
hat."
Maullir would prefer going without a hat to Dort.
Jomp settles the difficulty by saying, " Veil, you can see Dort if you
like; but—um—um—uui— re don't go near there."
We take a final walk on the Quay called from the little boompjes on
it "The Boompjes" (which, as a peripatetic club, we decide upon
always writing as pronounced, Boomp-je), arid depart for the Hague.
Note—I cannot agaiu refrain from drawing attention to the inge-
nuity of the Dutch as to names. They call a river the Rotter, and they
make a dam. It's a sort of charade. My first is Rotter, my second is
I lam, and my whole is the name of a place. Ans. Rotterdam.
They call a little tree a Boompje. 'Ihey plant several little Boompjes
on a Quay, and they call the Quay The Boompjes. There's a sim-
plicity ana a freshness about this which is quite enchanting.
The Hague.—Belle Vue Hotel. Very prettily situated, and first-rate
altogether. Goocn, delighted, lounges out of window, smoking
cigarettes. Maullir, in an arm-chair by a side window of sitting-
room, commences "taking a quaint bit." Bund is immersed in
Murray, correcting his statements by Bradshaw, and Jomp is some-
where, asking what is to be seen.
I sit aud admire the view—canal (of course), gardens, deer park,
large trees—charming.
The houses of the Upper Ten at the Hague are generally sit uated on,
as it were, square islands formed by stagnant canals. Smell delicious,
naturally. Query, if the people at the Hague are no worse in health
than at any other place—say, London—what's the use of attending to
drainage, sewerage, and good supply of water P
This problem puzzles us.
Having walked about for an hour or so (without Jomp and the bag,
thank goodness!), Gooch proposes finding out a restaurant, in order
to provide for luncheon. He says this travelling makes him so hungry.
We don't doubt him, seeing his appetite on every occasion. He is
always proposing to sit down to a meal when Maullir wants to take
us to a Picture Gallery. "Didn't we come to see the pictures P" asks
Maullir, who is satisfied with what he calls "a snack."
"Yes, says Gooch; but we can't see pictures without eating."
Decided : Gallery first, Hotel afterwards. . ,
In the Gallery.—First striking notice:—
Ilel is cerboden de tchildengen Aanteraken,
which is, of course, highly satisfactory.
Gooch and self now taken by Maullie to see "a masterpiece, Sir,
by Krmurandt."
Maullir walks straight into the room where it is, as if he'd been
there every day of his life regularly.
"There!" he exclaims, triumphantly. "There's the lecture on
Anatomy. Rrmerandt."
I see Bund surreptitiously consulting Bradshaw and a Notice des
Tableaux, before committing himself to an opinion.
Gooch says, " Ah I" aud looks round, to see if there are any other
spectators besides ourselves.
I don't exactly know what to say. After considering some time, I
venture upon a safe inquiry, founded upon Maullie's previous
remark, "1 suppose this is considered one of Remerandt s finest
pieces P"
"Certainly; yes," answers Maullie, and continues, enthusiasti-
cally: "look at old Tutp, there. Fine head, marvellous head."
1 inspect Tulp's head critically • at least, the head of the man I take
to be Tulp.
"There's character in that eyebrow!" continues Maullie.
I smack my lips, as if 1 were tasting it, and say, "Yes, indeed,"
(Boomp-je!) though I can't see that my Tulp has much in the way of
eyebrow. Also, which eyebrow P
"Then, look at the hands!" says Maullie.
This decides me. My Tulp is not his Tulp; mine only showing one
hand. Determine to find out which is Tulp. I ask, "If they are all
portraits of celebrated people P"
"Yes," replies Maullie, who is well up in it. ,

"Their names are on a piece of paper, held by one of them," Bund
informs ua, quoting from Murray, which he has just put in his pocket,
"and Tulp is lecturing on the body, in the centre."
(To myself. "Oh, that's Tulp!") Aloud, "Of course, that's Tulp in
the centre.
Gooch gives it as his opinion, that it's "a doosid unpleasant sub-
ject." And, turning away, suddenly comes upon two friends (not in
tourist suits) who are sauntering through the Gallery.
'" Hullo!" exclaims Gooch, in that tone of utter surprise at any-
body being abroad besides himself, peculiar to all travellers on meeting
friends.
"Hullo! "they return, in precisely the same strain. Then they
shake hands, as if a quarrel had parted them for years.
They are introduced by Gooch as Muntley and Finton. I don't
quite catch which is Muntley and which is Finton. I seem to have
heard the name before, as a Company Limited, or, on second thoughts,
in connection with candles and biscuits. No, that's Huntley and
Palmes: Huntley for biscuits, Palmer for candles. Muntley is
shortish and stoutisb, bis head generally a little thrown back, with the
air of a man who is taking breath before making up bis mind to tell
yon a secret. J
Finton is a quick, sharp fellow, with a nervous sort of laugh, as if
ready to turn oft' anything he might say too seriously into a joke.
Muntley (I discover) congratulates himself upon his conversational
powers, and being able to talk to anyone on any subject, specially Art.
Being introduced to Maullir—whom Gooch takes care to describe
apart to his friends as "the Maullie, you know, R.A.; you recollect
his picturesP" to which they reply, "Oh, indeed, Maullie, by Jove,
is it P" and they immediately overlook the hat and the tourist dress,
which was the Count's object in playing such a flourish of trumpets—
Muntley at once joins Maullie. "Very few good things here,"
says he.
"Um!" says Maullie, frowning at a jovial Jan Steen.
"They try to take one in with these catalogues," continues the
knowing Muntley.
I ask how.
"Why," he informs me for Maullie's benefit, "they pretend
they've got Rurens's pictures here, but they spell it' Ruerkns,' so
as to do you. Look here: '122. Venus el Adonis dm* un Paysage.'"
This be reads with a real British accent, adding his translation, "' Venus
and Adonis in a Passage, by Rurrens.' It won't do, you know."
I confess this does look like imposition.

Maullie is scowling furiously, but asks if Muntley has come across
any Van Dycks.
'Not one," answers Muntley, ingenuously. "There's nothing
about him here under the letter'D.' There are some pictures—two
Dijks—A. Van Dijk and Ph. Van Dijk ;" (he pronounces these like
"JJchick "): "but of course they 're nothing particular."

"Attention! " to the idea of an economy which might be effected in
the arms with which we furnish our gallant Volunteers. They remain
Iirovided with muzzle-loaders. If they now had to defend their native
and, Enfield rifles would be pitted against Chassepots. Nobody can
doubt which of those rifles would then work wonders. Of course the
Enfields would be practically useless. The Government, therefore,
should immediately sell them. The Emperor op Russia would per-
haps be willing to take them off our hands, for use in warfare with
Asiatic tribes armed with match-locks or flint-locks. Or perhaps we
might find a purchaser of them in the Kino op Bonny. Their place,
in the hands of our Volunteers might be supplied with mopsticks,
which would sufficiently well answer every purpose of ordinary drill;
and the Enfields can scarcely be good for much else. Instead of mop-
sticks the Volunteers' Enfield rifles might, indeed, be replaced with
breech-loaders; but these would cost money, and it is not certain that
we have just yet an enemy at our door. It will be time enough to
think of providing our domestic defenders with costly weapons needful
for real fighting when invaders shall actually have landed on our native
shore. The British Volunteers can familiarise themselves with their
new firearms whilst the foreign foes are marching on London. In the
meanwhile, perhaps, the proposal that the Enfields shall be exchanged
for mopsticks, may be favourably entertained by a Government praise-
worthily studious of every possible saving.

PLACETS AND NON-PLACETS.
"The orders for a salvo from Fort St. Angelo and a jubilant peal from all
the bells of Rome had been countermanded, but the solemnity was not un-
heralded, and the Pope proclaimed himself infallible amid peak of thunder
and terrific flanhes of lightning."—Letter in the Pall Mall Gazette from Some.
Not with peals of great guns from St. Angelo booming,
Not with clashing and clanging of jubilant bells,
But with lightning and thunder from clouds darkly looming,
'Neath a sky, like a pall summer sunlight o'erglooming,
Midst the roll and the rumble of warfare death-dooming,
Its last tale to the world, lo, the Vatican tells 1
In the chair of St. Peter, Apostle and Martyr,
'Neath the brave roof that skywards lifts Angelo's dome,
Sits he we call Pope (" Dalai Lama" in Tartar),
To proclaim, in the face of the world, the New Charter
That for Heaven's omnisoience man's nescience doth barter,
In the shaved head that wears the tiara of Home.
The dogma of dogmas I But gauge its credentials,
By the " Semper, ubique, ab omnibus" test—
Now first heard: nowhere held, save with due differentials,
(Avowed by the bold, if suppressed by prudentials)
By the Church's most learned denied in essentials,
And accepted, " sub modo," by most of the rest.
True, the dogma at last was proclaimed, scarce contested;
But two bold and bootless " non-placets" were heard:
But Heaven by its thunder against it protested,
And frowned from that sky where the clouds rose and rested,
On the impious falsehood that Reason devested,
And a Man's rushlight lit for the light of God's word!
"Placet / "—it pleases the weak and the wav'ring,
Who find in their fetters a prop and a stay;
The Jesuit despots, still tyranny fav'ring;
Obscurantists the daylight to stifle endeav'ring
Slaves and sycophants still the Pope's slipper beslav'ring,
Who resist only truth, aught but reason obey.
"Placet!"—it pleases whom Christ's word displeases,
Who rejoice at whate'er brings his doctrine to shame:
Those whose conscience from Law's strong compression it eases:
Those who call darkness light, read health's signs in diseases.
Those whom Reason disquiets, and Truth only teases,
Who hold Freedom licence, and Progress a name.
"Nonplacet!"—it pleases not those who, enlightened
By truth's light, through all veils hung in Cloister and Church,
Take that for their lode-star to steer by, uofrightened;
Those who bold that man's Reason by Faith should be brightened,
Not blighted ; and those who leave sepulchres whitened,
In God's living world for God's guidance to search.
"Non placet!"—it pleases not statesmen—no wonder
When no law, but the Church's, it hallows for man:
Nor monarchs, the base of whose thrones it eats under,
Nor peoples, whose family ties it would sunder,
Nor teachers, whose teaching it blasts with Church thunder,
Nor learners, whose learning it puts under ban.
With the "placets" so balanced against the "non-placets,"
What matter the votes by the Vatican scored P
Science will not lie still, spite of Jesuit "hicjacels,"
Truth's diamond ne'er lost e'en the least of its facets.
By the heat of Church fires, or the gag of Church " tacets,"

Sad Accident.
The other evening a gentleman, preparatory to going to bed, lighted
a candle and sat down to supper. It is supposed that he made an
over-hearty meal, and indulged somewhat too freely in the pleasures of
the table, as he was subsequently proved to have blown himself out and
left the candle burning. No reason" has been assigned for the rash
act, which seems sufficiently to account for the melancholy occurrence.

"When rogues fall out, Ihen honest men may hope to get their own,"
As wisdom of our ancestors is well and widely known.
Eut another reading pf the old saw hits truth as clean and clear,
"When rogues fall out, then honest men may hope the truth to hear!"
At peace John Bull was sitting, 'neath his vine and fig-tree's shade,
Mopping his hot brows, as he paused, awhile, from scythe and spade:
Counting his flocks, or planning work for shop and mart and mill,
And praying that St. Swithin his tanks and ponds might till.
When sudden burst War's thunderbolt out of the cloudless sky,
And John jumped to his feet aghast, and asked the reason why—
Amazed to find defiance hurled from Paris to Berlin,
Muster of arming millions, and deaf'ning war-like din.
He rubbed his eyes and asked, "What seed has ripened to such fruit P
Must I accept the cause 1 hear, or backward trace the root,
To the evil day when Germany on Denmark onslaught made;
To the quarrel 'twixt the robbers o'er the plunder of their raid;
"To the spoiling of the weaker thief by the hand of the more strong;
To Prussia's swift and sudden leap o'er bounds of right and wrong;
Till France grew jealous of her growth, and fumed and fretted sore,
That 'vol de Bismarck' even 'vol de I'aigW should out-soarF"
Till thinking of that four years' hate since Sadowa amassed,
He wondered less that into flame it should have burst at last:
Nor so puzzled o'er the smallness of the spark to fire the train
That blew Europe's peace to tatters, and Brought Chaos back again.
He noted France's fury, fired with war-lust as with wine,
The long-forbidden Marseillaise, her fierce cry "to the Rhine!"
He noted heavier Germany, whose fire, to light more slow,
Burns with a core more lasting and an intenser glow.
And he felt old German kinship, beating hot about his heart,
Angle and Saxon fibres in his being claiming part—
He said amen to German prayers, shared German hopes and fears,
As brother-blood spoke in his veins, brother-tongue in his ears.
When, lo! a bull's-eye sudden turned on a black and base intrigue
Sbows two crown'd burglars higgling hard over a robber-league!
Taking and giving kingdoms not their own to give or take,
And by treaty duly settling how treaties best to break.
The German faith he trusted so, to Bismarck's keeping given,
Brittle as a Napoleon's oath he finds, as easy riven;
He sits between the Emperor and the stout old Prussian king.
Sorry to feel distrust of both, on both his scorn to fling.
"Put not your faith in Princes," is the lesson in his mind,
As he cons the " Secret Treaty," for Belgium's doom designed.
But the ill-faith on both sides is the Princes', not the folks'
By Heaven's mysterious purpose condemned to bear their yokes.
Whatever dark-browed B ism arc k be, or may have thought or planned,
Not less John Bull's heart leaps to them that rise for Fatherland!
France strikes the blow that Germany is one man to strike back,
And the German prayer will reach to Heaven, be Bismarck, ne'er so
black!
Bismarck against Napoleon !—who the odds will give or take,
Which of the two more lightly his faith will bind or break P

Thus, should any

will be satisfied
with the Field-

from all blame, which will then fall solely and only on the officers in
command. Should, however, any accident happen, or contretemps
arise, from neglect on the part of the officers in command to carry
out literally the orders of the Field-Marshal Conimanding-in-Chief,
then he will hold them responsible for any such accident or contre-
temps, and by Jovn—that is, the Field-Marshal means he will visit
any dereliction of duty or non-compliance with his orders, with severe
and exemplary punishment. In short, the Field-Marshal Commanding-

to himself all decisions as to whether these acts have been in strict
compliance, or not, with his the Field-Marshal's orders.

MUSHROOMS MADE EASY.
Mr. Punch,
Everyrody almost (worth speaking about) has his hobby;
every man, that is: comparatively few hobbies are ridden with a side-
saddle. For my own part, I should be disposed to ride a bicycle if I
were not too fat and heavy. As it is, my hobby is Mycophagy, or to
descend to common and unlearned language, fungus-eating. This, Sir,
is not a merely animal pursuit; on the contrary, it is a pursuit of
objects, or subjects, belonging to the vegetable kingdom, by whose
quest, in exploring woodland and pasture, hill and dale, the mind is
elevated. Being known to be in the habit of eating toadstools and
puff-balls, I am accustomed frequently to receive, at the hands of my
friends, warnings similar to the one which I subjoin; an extract from
the Medical Press and Circular:—
"AVe are getting into the season for gathering and consuming mushrooms.
Within the p«st few days we have seen a well-marked case wherein a husband
and wife, who had partaken of mushrooms with their tea, which, do doubt,
had been mixed up with poisonous fun^i, were seized with the characteristic
symptoms of crjptogamic poisoning—the sense of sinking and
di&aolution, accompanied by cold perspiration, See."
Allow me to suggest the possibility, if not the probability, in the
present state of commercial morality, that the symptoms of poisoning
called "cryptogamic," were caused not by poisonous fungi which the
mushrooms had been mixed up with, but by poisonous leaves, or
"facings," mingled with the ter. Be that, however, as it may, the
Medical Press thus proceeds to explain, unnecessarily of course for
mycologists, and therefore with a view to the instruction of general
readers, the difference between "true" and "false" mushrooms :—
"The true mushroom as it developes itself ruptures the ovoid wrapper or
vulva, leaving the remains entirely at the base of the pedicle; whilst in the
false mushroom the debris of the vulva are found not only at the base of the
pedicle, as in the real Agaric, but even upon the red surface of the pileus
itself. These are the white irregular warts characteristic of the Amanita, but
wholly wanting in the Agaricus. Then, there are two Amanitas, the Amanita
tnuscaria, or ' fly agaric.' and the Amanita amaslica, or as the English bota-
nists call it, Agariais Camarcw, the imperial mushroom."
You, Sir, of course understand all this; but perhaps the majority of
even your readers hardly can. You also know that it is in some par-
ticulars inaccurate. In the first place there is, you are aware, no such
distinction among the kinds of fungi as that above drawn between
Amanita and Agaricus. The Amanita is a subgenus of the genus
Agaricus. In the next, you need not be told, though some people may,
firstly, that not every Amanita by any means is warty; and secondly,
that several Amanita; whose warts are numerous, are nevertheless very
good and wholesome eating. The Agaricus (Amanita) vernus, very
poisonous, has its milk-white innocent-looking cap perfectly smooth;
the Ag: (Am.) rubescens, and the Ag: (Am.-) slrobilifortnis have both
of them caps closely studded with warts, and are both eatable. You
have read Dr. Hsu ham's Esculent Funguses of England, and remember
that he says that the Amanita Ctesarea, which he describes as eatable,
has not been found in this country.
If any of your readers who may happen to be passing Mr. Hard-
wicke's shop in Piccadilly, will look luto its window, there they will
see two large sheets exhibiting coloured figures of fungi, one showing
the wholesome, the other the poisonous, and both including several
other kinds than the Amanita and Agaricus. These figures are accom-
panied with a brief description by Worth inoton Smith, whereof the
perusal may be recommended, especially to persons proposing to try
toadstool eating, without sufficient knowledge of the distinctive cha-
racters of toadstools wholesome and poisonous. In particular, let
them read Mr. Smith's account of the symptoms which he experienced
early in his fungus-eating researches and previously to his acquisition
of the knowledge they required, by indulging in less than a quarter of
an ounce of the Agaricm (Entoloma) fertilis. Wise men like you, Sir,
do not eat mushrooms unless they know the bad from the good as well
as they know parsley from hemlock. They read the right books about
them first, or study them in Nature, or, before they venture on dishes
of them, they consult plates. In the meantime, respecting matters
which to those who rashly meddle with them are " riddles and affairs
of death," advice should be accurate and intelligible, should it not P
Otherwise, it may even lead to confusion of the deleterious Agaricus
semiglobatus with the Marasmus Oreades or true Champignon
P.S. There is no fear that many people will be poisoned with fungi
if the drought continues. Drought breeds fungus dearth anyhow in
England, and in France too. No truffles! Failure of a most import-
ant ingredient in French cookery, causing general irritation, no doubt
one chief cause of the war.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 2$th, and a very Black Monday for sundry. A sensa-
tion was prepared for us all by the Times newspaper. With our
breakfasts this morning was served to us a French dish called a
Projet de Trails', and no one will say that it was not full-flavoured.
We were presented with a document purporting to be the basis of a
treaty, proffered in 1866 (the war-year) by France to Prussir. There
were five articles:—1. France was to recognise the conquests of
Prussir. 2. Prussia was to promise to help 1' ranee to Luxembourg,
by putting the screw on Belgium. 3. France was to assent to a union
of North and South Germany, excepting Austrir. 4. Prussia was to
help France to acquire Belgium. 5. The two Powers were to form a
league, offensive and defensive, against all the world.
What Tom Moore wrote about the effect produced on a certain
assembly by the proposal for whipping the naughty little Grand Lama
(by whom Charles the First was typified), will do again :—
"When this was read, no Congreve rocket
Discharged into the Gallic trenches,
E'er equalled the tremendous shock it
Produced on ' Parliamentary' benches."
Of course. the first question was, " Is it genuine P" Ministers were
interrogated in both Houses, and their answer was, that the document
had taken them by surprise, and that there was no doubt that the
spontaneous action of the Powers to whom the plot was imputed would
clear up the matter. "Clumsy forgery," said French partisans. "No
Frenchman could have written it, because it is not in good French,"
said small critics. "But the Emperor and Benedetti are Corsicans.
and neither writes very good French—the former made a grammatical
blunder in his last proclamation," was the rejonder. However, we
waited for authorised explanation, and it comes to this, dear brethren.
There is no doubt that some such terms were suggested, and that the
project fell to the ground. Whether Count Bismarck craftily led
M. Benedetti to offer them, or whether they proceeded originally from
the French mind, does not seem of great consequence. Our beloved
friends, France and Prussia, were discussing such things, in secret,
and the fact speaks marvellously well for the Morals of both Govern-
ments. That the burglarious plan was not carried out, was an accident,
and neither side can claim credit on that score. If A. talks to B. about
plundering C.'s house, and for some reason (perhaps because his friends
and neighbours D. and £. have an unpleasant habit of firing revolvers
at burglars), C.'s house is not broken into, we know what to think of
B. for listening to the proposal, and not proclaiming it to the world,
and kicking A. "The fierce light that beats upon a throne" was
carefully excluded, but the curtains have been torn down, and two
thrones look very shabby in the sunshine.
Now, of course, it is the business of A. and B. to persuade E. and
the rest of the alphabet that no such thing was ever really contem-
plated. How far they have succeeded in convincing J. and lus ever
vigilant and faithful friend P., may be discerned in a Cartoon upon
another page. Neutral, your Majesty Queen V. P Yes. indeed.
"We shall in all our best obey you, Madam. We are neutral enough,
and intend to be at present. Look at the picture, Lady. As
Francis Quarles says—
"Is not that type well cut? In every part
Filled with rich cunning, and with Zeuxian art?"
Mr. Punch is not to be bood-winked. He has warned A., and he has
exposed A. and 13., and he has a whole Gallery of Illustration in hand.
Meantime, let us watch events, and be quite prepared to hear, at no
distant date, that A. and B., after they have deluged Europe with as
much blood as is required by honour, have come to terms not unlike
those in the Projet de Traili. In which case but sufficient for the
day is the Crime thereof.
To-night, Earl de Grey and Ripox elaborately expounded the
Education Bill to the Lords, and it was received well, and read a
Second Time. Lord Shaptesrury thought it not unworthy of the

prayers of the nations; and Lord Howard of Glossop, a Catholic,
said that members of his Church, though they thought the measure
retrograde so far as Catholics were concerned, would support it for the
sake of forwarding the general education of the country. Spoken as a
Howard should speak.
In the Commons, important crisis notwithstanding, question was
asked whether a magistrate had done right in flogging a fellow who
had been convicted of six violent and several smaller assaults, finishing,
for the present, by a brutal attack on a gaoler. Yet such questions do
good; for the publication of the facts conveys to a very large class, to
whom the information is desirable, the news that society does use a cat
upon savages. Lowest class papers, please copy.
In Supply, Mr. Atrton made the gratifying statement that the
hideous and costly iron rails with which the Works have begun to
surround the Regent's Park are to be given up, and a rustic wooden
paling is to be substituted, as desired by the inhabitants. Again we
have the pleasure of complimenting Mr. Ayrton, upon whom, we
believe, our gentle and affectionate hints have wrought, well.
He also said that the artists had advised the discontinuance of
Mosaic decoration in the Central Hall. Electors do not, desire this
discontinuance as regards the House, the Mosaic decoration whereof
hath been added to by Rochester, which returns Mr. Julian Gold-
8MID, and thus increases the acute and valuable group of members of
the Hebrew faith, who do, as Mr. Punch always predicted that they
would do, good service to the country.
Tuesday. Earl Granville settled the " forgery " question, stating
that the Prussian Minister had a copy of the Treaty in the hand-
writing of M. Benedetti, and would publish it, in the Berlin official
paper. His Lordship added that the French Minister here affirmed
that the Treaty had originated with Count Bismarck, and never had
any " serious basis." Mr. Punch has spoken.
Yes, and the Lords read a Second Time a Bill for improving our
system of enlistment, and for creating an Army of Reserve.
Do you remember the Irish Church Bill P There now, don't be impa-
tient: the weather is rather cooler than it was, but still you should
avoid excitement. Mr. Punch was merely going to mention that as a
corollary (that is, coral necklace, or finishing ornament round the neck
of Madame Ecclesia), a Bill is in progress for lending Government
money to build decent houses for the Irish clergy of all denominations.
The money is to be paid back—there is no Endowment. There was
some growling, and polite Mr. Hadfield called Mr. Gladstone the
Creature of Necessity, but the Bill was read a Second Time by a large
majority.
On the Census Bill Sir John Luerock raised a curious question.
He wanted a return of all those who have married their First Cousins,
and this was asked in connection with a theory that such marriages arc
undesirable. Now, as every boy in the world falls in love with some
first cousin, Mr. Punch cannot think that Nature forbids the banns.
Moreover, such marriages usually turn out happily, because the parties
have had such capital opportunities of getting their quarrelling over
before wedlock. The House declined to let the question be asked.
Sir David Salomons was not allowed to add to the Factories Bill
a clause to relieve Jews engaged in tobacco-making from the penalty
for working on Sunday. The refusal was clearly right, unless Christians
could be prevented from buying Sunday-made Pickwicks, and thus
being partakers in the offence.
Wednesday. A Bill about superannuating (who said super-QueEN
ANNE-uatingf get out!) Queen Anne's Bounty officials, was read a
Second Time. Those whom it concerns must look up the debate—it is
easy to see why Mr. Punch even mentioned it.
The Ballot Bill was read a Second Time. Mr. Gladstone, at some
length, explained how he bad become a convert to the Ballot, and Mr.
Disraeli, in regretting that an important question of constitutional
politics should be brought on at the fag end of a Session, hardly
thought Mr. Gladstone's reasons satisfactory, and blandly wondered
why ne had never addressed them to his former chief, Lord Palmer-
ston, when he had denounced secret voting.
On the Bill for improving the Shannon, Mr. M'Laren ventured on
the enormous statement that the Caledonian Canal was a mistake.
Now, whether that lovely road into the loveliest country pays or
doesn't, is a detail quite beneath Mr. Punch's notice. But when he
recollects Mr. David Hutcheson's gigantic boats, the charming
brides who form a galaxy of beauty thereon, also the salmon cutlets,
the pleasant lounges and flirtations (not, of course, with brides), when
the boat is getting through locks, and the luxurious corners where you
smoke and gaze on glorious mountains and translucent waters, Mr.
Punch cannot hear a word against that Canal—would he were upon it
now! Even that stupid bit where you are pulled by a horse ridden by
a cove in red, and idiotic Cockneys and provincials pitch halfpence to
the howling little savages (in the lowest and vulgarest spirit of snob-
bery, and to the disgust of travellers of the decent sort), is pleasant in
its way. No words against the Canal in the hearing of Mr. Punch.
lour health in a dram, Mr. M'Laren, and do not offend us.
Thursday. Earl Granville made a statement as to the war, and
showed, as was admitted by Lord Russell and Lord Malmesrury,
that the English Government had done all in its power to prevent the
Crime. Moreover. Mr. Punch was delighted, though not surprised to
hear that his friend, Mr. Latard, had managed affairs at Madrid with
great energy and judgment. Considering what trouble has been
caused to Mr. Punch by Mr. Layard's vacating a certain office, it says
much for the former's bounding and elastic nature that he can speak
thus cheerfully.
The Lords sent through Committee the Bill enabling clergymen who
have mistaken their vocation to adopt another, but knocked out the
clanse which permitted them to return to the Church.
His Grace of Argyle gave us the Indian budget. We have heard that
there was a little friendly rivalry between the Duke and Mr. Grant
Duff as to who should be first with this statement, and that the latter
rather tried to steal a march on his chief, but took kindly a little hint
from his chiefs chief. For the affair is dull enough, and for the official
who has to give the second edition of the Indian story, it is very up-
hill work. The Duke had a very small audience. Do you want to
know more of Indian finance than that Lord Salisrury thanked his
Grace for a statement that was both "interesting and satisfactory."
But, it, is clear that Government accounts are kept in a very odd fashion
in India, and that amazing blunders are made. Mr. Gourley asked
a question of importance. May English coal-vendors vend coal to
France or Prussia just now? Answered the Attorney-General, that
in certain circumstances coal was contraband of war, but that sellers
must, find out for themselves what those circumstances are. If Mr.
Punch's own valued legal adviser gave him no better answer about
coals, that excellent adviser would receive that; which envelopes them
in their passage from wharf to cellar.
More Supply, and to Mr. Beresford Hope, who asked whether the
House was to have only forty-eight hours to consider where the
animals now at the British Museum should be put, Mr. Lowe re-
sponded that to his knowledge, Mr. Hope had been considering the
matter for seven years.
Friday. Lord Granville told the Lords that the French Ambas-

Frauce, was the contriver of the Secret Treaty, and that the latter was
an innocent fly, enmeshed in the cobweb of the spider-Count. We

"Stinging strongly to be free"—
but, perhaps it is a Humble-Bee.
The Education Bill went through Committee with very little altera-
tion—none of importance, whereby Mr. Forster's tact was illustrated.
The Lords applauded mention of his name.
The Commons talked about Coals for the Navy, and got through the
Naval and Civil Service Estimates, passed the Census Bill, and got
away about half-past two in the morning. Prorogation is hoped to be

he commissioned Eugenie to read to the Frency Navy:—
"Go, then, display with pride your national colours. In seeing the tri-

everywhere it carries in its folds the honour and glory of Franoe."
Nothing finer or more characteristic than this was ever said in the

THOUGHTS OF GREAT MEN.

"O Solitude I by rushy banks of sedgy streams flowing through extra-parochial places, by
mountain torrents unpolluted by the sewage of corporate towns, by boundless prairies where the
lone eagle hovers in its eyry to swoop down, this hot weather, on the more lonely lamb, we woo,
we court, we molest thee! Thy Yotaries, thy devotees, thy honorary members are to be found
alike in the unquestioned stillness of the arenaceous Sahara, and the multiplied hum of popu-
lous cities; on the marge of the sequestered lake where the turtle coos and the thirsty wagtail
drinks, and in the midst of the manufacturing districts; on the crowning peak of the inacces-
sible Alp, and on the top of the Monument.
"Poets have sung thee, prose writers praised thee; philosophers have analysed thy advantages,
and eremites retreated from the world and the Row to the shelter of thy unfading arms; and
Here is a little lyric, by an anonymous
hand, of the Elizabethan period, which
Herriuk or Hooker might have written
in their happiest moments. Hitherto it has
only existed in MS. in the Catacombs :—
"Ah, welladav!
That jocund May
When Celia first I spied,
With flowing gown,
And hair adown,
And lambkins by her side.
"Within the shade
The musk-rose made,
Entwined with eglantine,
We heard the dove
Unfold his love,
And crushed a cup of wine.
"Fond maid and youth,
Our troth and truth
We plighted iu the bower:
The dream is fleet,
But honey-sweet,
When Cupid wants a dower.
"Then, Celia, brave
The cloud and wave
That threaten every lot—
My love, my life,
My second wife,
My own forget-me-not."

One reason for the War has been alleged

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SOME RECRUITS FOR THE SOUTH GERMAN ARMY.
(jfR. PVXcn WILL NOT BREAK HIS HEART TO PART WITH THEM.)
Drar Punch,
A "GRAND REMONSTRANCE."
We appeal to you, as an old friend of our families. We are ill-used indi-
viduals. The man who has so long been associated with us in the thoughts of every
British subject, in facetious journals, in statistical papers, and in London and pro-
vincial Directories, has stolen a march upon us, has basely deserted his comrades,
has had the hardihood to emerge from the modest obscurity in which we have all
up to this date been content to dwell, and is now at this very hour flaunting
before the eyes of that public of which he is the laughing-stock, himself, and his
name and his family pretensions!!!
Imagine our individual surprise and joint disgust when we saw, openly ad-
vertised, a work with the audacious title of The Heraldry of Smith I—Smith!!
Heraldry!!! At first we believed it to be a hoax, a joke, and as such dismissed
it from our minds; but now, when we have inspected the hook, when we have pur-
chased a copy by our united contributions, we can no longer doubt the guilt of the
cunning traitor, or shut our eyes to his amazing presumption.
But we shall be avenged. We are taking the promptest measures. The College
of Arms, learned members of the Society of Antiquaries, industrious students in
the Libraries of the British and Kensington Museums, are all at work for us and
our time-honoured names, and in a very brief space of time Smith will find himself
overtaken and outstripped, extinguished and annihilated, when all the world is
struggling who shall be the first to obtain and read The Pedigree and Blazon of
Brown, The Family Tree and Genealogy of Jones, and The Roll of Honour of Robinson.
Begging your acceptance of large (foolscap) paper copies of these forthcoming
works, destined, we are convinced, to constitute an era in the literary history of
our glorious country, and to smash up Smith,
We are, dear Punch,
Your faithful trio,

THE 'BAPTISM OP FIRE."
The boy rode hy his father's side
Watching his father's face,
As battle's voices, far and-wide,
Hoared through that peaceful place.
The rifles cracked, the bullets sung,
The file-fires rattled shrill,
Aud battery answ'ring battery rung
Hollow, 'twixt bank and hill.
Through summer wood, o'er stubble fiY.Id
By hasty harvest cleared,
And furrows forced their rood to )ield,
Unripe, lest foes appeared.
They rode together, son and sire,
Their raid on German ground,
Watching war's game of blood and fire
And Death at work an mid.
'T»as strange to see the impassive face
Under the haggard brow.
Wherein no man the thought might trace,
Or feeling, even now.
And strange from that worn face to pass
To the fresh face beside,
That looks its first, at death, alas!
And learns its truth to hide!
'Tis said that soldiers wept to see
The boy, so calm and lair,
That iron-rain face fearlessly
As any veteran there.
And when a bullet in its leap
Struck in his horse's way,
He bade them give it him, to keep—
In memory of the day.
And when what pens of office call
"The victory !" was won,
And " cease fire" rang from bugle-call
The sire embraced the son.
Happy (his firstling laurel-leaved)
To flash along the wire—
"Bejoice! our Louis has received
His baptism of the fire!"
When Rome's boys from the softer sex
Passed to the hands of men,
They hung the "bulk" round their necks,
And called them youths from then.
Shall this ball hang, O Eugenie,
Thy fair boy's neck around,
To tell of all the blessings he
Hath in that baptism found P
Baptism of blood, and tears, and fire!
Three Chrisms—to mock the one
From Jordan's wave, that, gave his sire
And thee a Christian sou.
"What We Have to Bear.
Mr. Montagu Chamrers thought, or, at least, said, in
a debate on Supply, that " in time of peace Colonels might
be dispensed with." An excessively vulgar and slangy
officer, a ptrticular friend of ours, said that he always
fancied Chamerks had rather a good Nut (head), but it
was clear that his kernel had been dispensed with, or he
wouldn't have talked such &c., &<•., &c.
We ordered him out of the room: but he wouldn't go,
and demanded liquid, as a ieward for what he evidently
thought a brilliant epigram.
Foolish Wonder.

the socket.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, Augmt\. There! The House of Lords passed the Irish
Laud Bill—the second " Message of Peace" to Ireland. It is rather a
complicated message; and it has been a good deal confused by after-
thoughts on the part of the senders, but it is well meant, and it will, we
hope, be accepted in the spirit in which it is forwarded. If received
rudely, the next may not be quite so affectionate.
The gallant veteran, Earl Russell, has been stirred by the War-
trumpets, and to-night he brougnt in a Bill, on his own account, for
enabling the Queen to call out the Militir. Next night, he delivered
as good a speech as he ever made, full of recollection, fire, and patriot-
ism. He dwelt on the crisis, and boldly declared that an attack on
Belgium would be the most wanton outrage of modern times; but that
it might be averted, if England made the Continent understand that
she meant to abide by her treaty-obligations. Hear the generous
tribute of the Tory Standard to the brave old Whig :—
"Usually inaudible, except upon the benches around him, or, at the best,
heard only imperfectly in other parts of the house, the last Leader of the great
Whig party spoke yesterday with a freshness and a force which affected all
who listened to him. His heart was in his words. All the old traditions, all
the old English sentiments of honour and good faith, seemed to crowd them-
selves upon and to struggle for utterance through his lips; and we cannot, in
times like these, regret or censure a speech which, in its last sentences, struck
with a master skill the chords which vibrate in the hearts of Englishmen."
The Foreign Minister deprecated discussion, and regretted that Earl
Russell's language seemed to imply a want of confidence in the
Government, who were mindful of their duties and obligations. He
would lay on the table the Treaties guaranteeing the independence of
Belgium and of Luxembourg. Mr. Punch takes leave to place on
record an expression of the obligation " conferred upon himself, and
the nation which he represents, by the well-timed and spirited appeal of
his friend Earl Russell. Further, he refers the Earl and the world
to a Cartoon, by the execution whereof Mr. Punch has done his part
in expounding the Situation.
The House of Commons was crowded, Mr. Disraeli having given
notice that he should speak on foreign affairs. The Leader of Oppo-
sition declared that in war-times great injury had been done by too
much silence and reserve on the part of the British Parliament. He
therefore intended to try to induce Government to speak out. After
sketching our treaty-engagements, he said that he had no evidence that
Government had taken advantage of our position to protest against the
War. Prussia and France were fighting, and Austria's guarantee
ended with the War of 1866, but the co-guarantee of Russia remained
in force. He hoped that England and Russia were acting in concord.
Were we strong enough to speak out f In what condition were our
Army, Navy, Militia, and Volunteers P Had we been reducing ex-
penses ton much for safety P Let Government answer this, and let
them speak firmly and clearly to Foreign Powers.
It is not a small thing that should induce Mr. Punch to speak unfa-
vourably of an utterance by the Premier, for whose genius, earnest-
ness, and uprightness the former shares the admiration telt by the
nation. But though a triend to Gladstone, Mr. Punch is a greater
friend to Veritas. The Premier's speech was "reticent" to a fault;
and at such a crisis there should be no fault in statesmanship. He was
adroit, of course, and Mr. Disraeli had laid himself open to easy
retort by wandering into topics not directly bearing on the great issue.
The practised dialectician parried these thrusts without an effort. But
he said nothing assuring or satisfactory, and his answer was in the
spirit of the M.P. to whom Nicholas Nickleby wished to be Secretary,
aud who informed his constituents that his course would be guided by
his convictions of what was most for the interest of his inestimable
country. We wanted more from our guide, philosopher, and friend.
It, will be observed that Lord Granville's more acceptable statement
followed that of his chief by twenty-four hours, and we may suppose
that in the meantime the pulse of the nation had been felt by its
doctors.
There was a good debate, with no oratory, but much common-sense.
The Army Minister declared that the resources of England were never
in a better state
[But, your Mig hi Honourabilily, this same night, you asked foi 20,000
more soldiers, and Two Millions to pay them with.]
than now. The Navy Minister declared that our fleet was in splendid
force.
[ This, Four First Lordship, we arc happy to believe.']
Various speakers said their say, among them Mr. Bernal Osrorne,
who was not satisfied with the rose-coloured pictures drawn by
Ministers, Mr. H. Kic hard, a Welsh Dissenting Minister, and repre-
sentative of the Peacr-ar.-any-Price society, and Sir Henry Bui.wer,
wbo, by the way, thought that M. Benedetti had been the victim of
self-deception in the matter of the Projected Treaty. He hoped that
there would be no war, and said that it would be averted by our
making no mystery of our intention to stand by our Treaties.
But Mr. Gladstone would not be drawn into any declaration, save
that the detected Secret Treaty had given a shock to public confidence,
and that the Government were taking steps to provide for the public
security.
The Bill forbidding Enlistment in Foreign Armies was proceeded
with, and so was the Post Office Bill. Note, the Book Post privilege
is unaltered by this measure. Yes, but we wish it had contained a
clause making it penal to treat book-parcels with outrageous roughness.
No care in enveloping can preserve book-covers from ill-usage. Mr.
Punch remembers hearing a person, who was dashing down his cards
somewhat vulgarly, reminded that he was playing whist, not skittles.
Would the Post Office folks consider that books are not paving-stones P
Thus, in the midst of a mighty war, does the all-mindful Mr. Punch
think of the interests of the pale student who sits in his study, reading
iu an easy chair, with an easel, his legs up, and his pipe and soda-cum-
gin by his side. Even for that pensive being has Punch an eye, though
millions are rushing to battle.
Tuesday. The fight began in earnest. The French bombarded Sasr-
briick, and beat out the Prussians.
In the Lords was passed the Education Bill. Whereof it is a
consolation to think that we shall not have to speak again, until after
many days.
The Lords will have a Religions Census, and carried it against Dr.
Temple of Exeter (who was for forgetting, not proclaiming divisions)
and the Government, by 43 to 29. Mr. Putch observes that the
Wesleyan Methodist Conference desires this. 'I he Methodists are very
strong, and have nothing to fear from exposure of their numbers.
Moreover, let him note with great pleasure that Dran Stanley will
alio > memorials to be placed in the Abbey to John Wesley and bis
brother Charles.
Further War talk in the Commons, and expression of the Premier's
opinion that England had better not remonstrate against the strife, but
watch events.
We had a debate on the Greek Brigandage, which is not to be for-
gotten, though brigandage on a grander and more glorious scale is in
hand. Sir Henry Bulwer, with an excellent speech, demanded what
Government had done. Came the old answer, that inquiry was not
yet over. There had been a change in the Greek Ministry, and so far
from mending matters, this had caused the prohibition of the presence
of English agents at the inquiries. We had protested against this pro-
hibition. Promise to obtain satisfaction was renewed. The Greeks
are evidently playing the juggling game; but one day John Bull will
lose his temper, and then it will be a case of Greciafuit.
The vote for the New Soldiers was taken, and (alter some debate on
the efficiency of the Army, which Sir John Pakington asserted to
have been reduced from 137,000 men by 24,000) was divided on—
There were 161 for it, and 5 against it.
Supply, and it was finally settled that the Beasts, Birds, Fishes,
Insects, Kggs, and all the Natural History at the British Museum,
should be sent off to South Kensington, aud £6,000 was voted for land
whereon to build a receptacle for thtm. Mr. Punch heartily rejoices
at seeing them turned out of the present, building, as there are in its
cellars rich treasures of Art, which there has been no room to exhibit.
But whether the Zoology should have been sent so many miles away
from the homes of the only class (except students) that cares about it,
is another matter.
Wednesday. The Prussians crossed the Lautera, stormed Weissen-
burg, and beat out the French.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Commons threw oat the Sale of Liquors on Sunday Bill, its
patron, Mr. Thomas Hughes, being gone to America, where we
heartily hope he will enjoy himself. The Sunday Trading Bill was also
rejected: but Mr. Bruce said that this was on the question of the
period of the Session, and did not commit the House to an opinion.
Government introduced a Bill for enabling them, at need, to embody
the Militir. But if this should be done during the recess, Parliament
is to be summoned within ten days. So here is another reason, (in
addition to patriotism) why our Senators must desire peace. N.B. The
larger part of the Militia have breechloaders.
Thursday. Mr. Otway, for Government, very properly said that as
all French Treaties were in the library, there was no good reason for
re-printing them, and that there was no reason at all for re-printing the
Treaty of 1815, by which the Buonaparte family were excluded from
the throne of France. What next will Members want to have issued
at the expense of the nation f Magna Charts, perhaps, or Bradshaw
from its commencement.
Mr. Nrwdrgate delivered a long speech against the Bill for repeal-
ing the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, and then the Second Reading was
carried by 111 to 34. In its present form, the Bill is said to be more
insulting to Catholics than the original measure. Perhaps Mr.
Nrwdrgate did not know this. Since, the Bill has become Law.
Friday. Sir George J kxkinson asked Mr. Gladstone what was to
be done towards securing the independence of Belgium, and was
informed that such Independence was secured by the Treaty of 1839.
There is a Horse-Panic, that is, some people are afraid that the
foreigners at war are buying up all our horses, but an answer was given
to this by the statement that only 1288 have been sold away since the
1st July. If Mr. Bruce could induce the Continentals to buy nearly
all our cab-horses, and thus compel the cab-owners to put on fresh
cattle, he should have an equestrian statue, as big as that of King
Richard I. behind the House, and a great deal handsomer.
Sir John Elphinstonr had a good deal to say about the deficiency
of Admiralty Stores, aud was answered by the First Lord, who was
not particularly anxious to show his contempt for the allegations which
imputed to him that he did not do his duty. Punch fancied he caught
something about "cock and bull stories," and "old grumbles."
We had the Indian Budget, previous to which Mr. Fawcett made
rather a strong speech, assailing the Government for bringing on that
important matter so late; and, moreover, he was much displeased
with various items, such as the Ball given to the Sultan, which he
thought most improperly thrown upon Indian Revenue. The Budget,
of course, was the same as that of the Duke op Argyll; but, the
wonderful thing was that, at the Morning Sitting, there was actually a
House to listen to Indian matters. Mr. Grant Duff had to make
two bites of bis Oriental cherry, and take the second half in the even-
ing; and, somehow, Members contrived to interest themselves on this
topic until two o'clock on Saturday morning. This should be known
throughout the Indian Empire. Britannia is not like the iracund
Achilles, and does not "request that all details may be managed
exactly as anybody pleases, as all that she cares to hear about is War"
—an exquisitely free rendering, which evidently marks out Mr. Punch
as the next Homeric Translator.
NEW SONGS AND MUSIC OF THE FUTURE.

The Stationary Gentile : Companion (as far as possible) to The Wan-

of course, well sung, by Mr. Santley. Our baritone has lately iden-
tified himself with two cheerful characters, i.e., The Flying Dutchman
and The Wandering Jew. Herr Wagner might be induced to consider
these two subjects together, and combine the ideas. The notion of the
plot would be, perhaps, something of this sort: Act 1. The Wandering
Jew while walking, annoyed by the Flying Dutchman—W. J. tries to
eaten the F. D.—and fails. Of course, they will both be in love with
the same young woman; and, in the last Act, the Flying Dutchman
flies off with the lady, struggling. The Wandering Jew (now more than
"wandering," in fact, almost mad) seizes a gun and shoots the F. D.,
who falls with his lovely burden (this would be the burden of a trio) on
the luckless wanderer, and all three perish in the crash.

go round the steamboat in which the dis-

mouey for the dinner, just as the sixpence
is taken from ordinary travellers. "Now,
then, any one not paid P" may not be a
dignified demand, but it is better than an
abandonment of the banquet. Mr. Punch
bets that Mr. Lowe would collect the
money easily enough, aud chaff the head
off anybody who pretended he had left
his purse at home, or would send a cheque next day. Nor would be
be very soft on any one who might ask the Chancrllor of the
Exchequer to pay for him, even though the insinuating request were,
"Advauce, Australia!" Disestablishment of Irish Loaves and Fishes
was all right, not so Disestablishment of Greenwich brown Bread aud
Whitebait. Punch would heartily have given the tin mug and wooden
spoon, rather than that the ancient and constitutional ceremony should
have been done away.
MEDIEVAL MEDITATIONS.
BY A KIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN.
I am not now so young as when
The ball-room first I graced;
My hair is thinner now than then,
And thicker is my waist.
Less for my costume now I care,
And for my comfort more:
Tight boots I long have ceased to wear,
Loose slippers I adore.
I feel my heart no longer beat
As when with love 'twould swell:
The fairest belle I joy to greet
Is now the dinner-bell.
At cricket I was deemed A 1,
At foothall, too, ne'er doubt:
Alas! one's love for foothall's gone,
When one has got the gout.
Too fat for croquet flirting now,
To cards I must resort;
And billiards plumply I '11 avow
My most athletic sport.
But what attests advancing age
In me more strongly still
Is that a cab I must engage
To mount up Hampstead Hill.

has about as much idea of doing anything of the sort as he has of examin-

sounds uyll.)

INWHITA MINERVA.
This was the mode in which it was last week suggested (in Parlia-
ment) to get rid of the Isle of Alderney :—
"Mr. Whits said that it would be better for Her Majesty's Government to
purchase the fee simple of the island and blow it into the eea."
Hem! There seems to be some feeling of rivalry in this suggestion—
some insular hostility. Does Mr. White reside—as the proposal
woujd lead us to infer—on one of the group of Islea to be seen from
the Land's End P Grateful Alderney should commemorate the pro-
posal by calling itself, for the future, the Isle ot White.

of speaking Krench when abroad, reply in chorus, " Oui."

Bund, who has his Murray by his side (out of the bag) says, "Won-
derful for its truth to Nature;" as if he'd lived among bulls all his
life; and, " It's marvellous"—here he inspects the piclure closely, and
then falls back a few paces,—" It's marvellous how he's arianged his
masses."
As this sounds like knowing something about it, we all (except
Maullie, who hasn't said anything as yet,) agree with Bund, " that it is,
as a fact, wonderful how Potter"—a little too familiar, perhaps, but
it shows a thorough knowledge of the artist—"how Pottrh has
arranged his masses."
[.Note— Consulting Murray afterwards, I find where Bund has got
his expression from. Boomp-je !)
Gooch exclaims, after a minute's silence, "C'est un tableau de
grandeur naturetlt.
I join Muntley and Fint in in responding "Oui."
[Note.—Having purchased a catalogue, I discover this is a quotation.
Also Boomp-je!)
Maullie says, "Yes, clever, uf course, but uninteresting. Very
mnch overrated;" and he walks off to No. 125, Le Confesseur de
Rubbens, a portrait by Rurens of the cheeriest Monk possible.
"Isn't that thr very fellow you'd pick out for jolly old Peter Paul's
Confessor, eh P " cries Maullie. We all agree, except Muntley, who
is a little bothered by the double b in Ruerkns, and inquires of
Finton, in an undertone, " Peter who P" Subsequently he evinces his
knowledge of the subject by mentioning old Peter Paul's Bull.
Bund, who has his own ideas of art, professes intense admiration for
the works of art painted by the Brothers Both. He takes us, one by one,
into corners where pictures by these artists are hung. He tees officials
to lower or draw up window-blinds (the Boths are generally in the worst
possible lights), in order to show us the beauties of the Boths. He
doesn't ask Maullie to look at them, but canvasses (as it were) for a
majority iu favour of his (Bund's) opinion before appealing to
Maullie. Bund, being the Commander, Commodore, and Paymaster-
General, we agree with him, to a certain extent, about the Boths, of
whom we have never before heard. Muntlry and Finton join us, and
express their sentiments, as far as to say, " Yes, very pretty."
"Look at the sunset/' says Bund, pointing it out enthusiastically.
"Mustn't touch the picure!" ssys the official who pulled up the
blind, translating Het is verboden, §-c."
"No, of course not," returns Bund; "but," to us, "isn't the
sunset admirable P"
We think it is certainly. "It's so wouderful," continues Bund,
"that the Boths, being Dutch, should paint Italian scenery."
We admit that it is very wouderful. Muntley, after some considera-
tion, asks, slowly, " Why P"
"Why r " returns the Commodore. "Because,"—he begins as if he
was answering a conundrum,—" Because—they never saw it."

August 13, 1870.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
This answer being satisfactory to all parties, we more on to another
picture.
Note— Bund's explanation, as above given, seems to be framed on
Hie Jomp model. For the present we don't hear any more of the
Roths, in consequence of Goocu's insisting upon our going back to
luncheon. The Count says that having fed only two hours ago, he is
so confoundedly hungry. Maullie remains in the gallery until shut in
bv ihe docs being closed for the day, and then turned out by one
of the officials, who finds him sitting solemnly before La Lecoit
d'Anatomic da Professeur Wp, No. 116. After this, he appears at the
Hotel.
Jo«p is now summoned. During our absence he is supposed to
have found out all that is to be seen in or near The Hague. Muntley
and Finton. as friends of Gooch's, have been asked to j .in us pro tern.
"Now, Jomp," says Bund, "what's to be seeu next r"
"Veil," answers the intelligent Jomp, rubbing his head, as usual,
and letting his eyes wander vaguely round the party, as if hoping that
some one would suggest something—
"Veil—um—um—um—dere's de pictures." Thinks it out, and
adds, "Ah; but you 'ave seen dem."
"Isn't there a celebrated town near here, eh P Lejden P" mgges's
Giioch, who thinks he's got, hold of the p'ace where Le Prophete
(Mario or Tamrerlik is included in this idea) came from.
"Isn't there a fishing-place—ScheveuingenP" asks Bund, on
Murray's authority, before Jomp can answer. Jomp, who has begun to
think out the first question, turns bis attention to the Commander's
inquiry.
Veil "he begins, when Maullie jumps up from his seat
(Rooinp-je !!) and interrupts.
"I beg your pardon," cries Maullie, apologising to every one in
general, and only looking at Jomp, " but isn't there a private collection
somewhere here, P"
M unti.et and Finton, together, say, "Oh, yes, lots"
Jomp becomes perfectly damp with agitation. He looks as if ano'lier
question, put suddenly and sharply, would knock him down. A pri-
soner at the bar aske.d to plead " Guilty or Not Guilty " could not
appear more utterly miserable than Jomp. He mops his head with the
dull-coloured cotton handkerchief (" 1 will get, him a new one," Goot'il
is heard to murmur), pockets it, puts his hands behind him, and having,
so to speak, pulled himself together for an effort, says,
"Veil—dere is Schevening—oh. yes—you can go dere—oh, yes—and
a private collection of pictures—oh, yes"
"At ScheveningenP" asks Bund, thinking to kill two birds with
one visit,.
"At Sohevening P" replies Jomp, considering: then, after cautiously
thinking it out, he adds, "No; you can not see de collection dere—
um—uui—because, you know, it's here" And he looks round to us as
if for confirmation of the truth of his argument.
"Then where is itP" asks Maullie. "We're here to see the
Dutch school, aren't we P" We nod our heads, like the ghosts in Rip
Van Winkle, or Mr. Corrett at Madame Tussaud's. "Let's go
there at, once, Jomp ;" and he takes up his hat.
"But," exclaims Goocil, " it's a private house. You cau't go, in that
dress—and thai, hat."
"Pooh!" says Maullie, "don't come if you don't like. Now,
Jomp, you can show us where it is."
The Count makes one last effort. "Let's have a carriage, and drive
there in style. Hang it! don't let's walk to a private house like
rabble—or bailiffs."
Jomp says, " It's not vorth vhile to 'ave a carriage. It's only a few
siecs."
We setoff: Gooch protesting to his friends, apart, that it's too
bad of M aullie; and " Hang it!" he adds, " be 'a got an umbrella i
liow as big as a clothes-bag. It brings such a bad name on English- j
men. Fancy," he goes on protesting, "a lot of fellows with bags, um-
brellas, and wide-awake hats, colling on one of us in London P Would
we let 'em in P Pooh!"
"A few steps," as represented by the intelligent J5mp, turns out to
be half through the town, a distance doubled by Jomp's forgetting the
way, and then the name of the street. Arrived at our destination, an
elegant newly-painted residence of some municipal notability, JoMP
knocks at the door, being induced to do so by the Commander.
(" He 'II think we've all come to dinner," says Gooch, still protest-
ing, " It's too absuid.")
A neat maid appears.
What, she says, in Dulch, we don't, know.
"Speak to her," says Rund to Jomp, with confidence in Jomp's
acquaintance with the language.
Jomp appears to become suddenly bashful, and what he says to her
is a perfect mystery to everyone, including the maid, who stares
at him.
"Dash it!" says Gooch, "she '11 think we 're all drunk."
There does appear a probability of this, and of Jomp's being removed
by some authorities as drunk and incapable, for he stands on the door-
step grinning and sputtering some unintelligible sounds which may
mean something to him, but nothing to anybody else belonging to any
known nationality.
Maullie begins something in French.
Gooch says, " It's no good, she doesn't understand that."
Bund, becoming very angry,swearsat Jomp. "What the Boomp-jedid
you bring us here for, if you can't speak the iuf—Boomp-je languageP"
he asks of the unfortunate Jomp.
Jomp, in an agony and almost in tears, replies, "Veil, you vould
come here. I can't 'elp it. I tought she'd know vy ve came." Then
he turns to the girl, who by this time has become almost pale with fear,
and with a gentle smile this time, tries some words on her which he
believes to be very like, if not absolutely, Dutch.
This and his smile ('a confounded luuatic leer!" says Gooch,
whose temper has quite gone) settles the question. She biugsthe
door, overturning Goocu on to Bund, and the next minute we see the
family of l he private collector at the windows, regarding us wilh horror
and amazement,.
"Veil,'' sajs Jomp, p'eking himself up from the lower doorstep, " Ve
can't, see that if Uiey von't, let, us in."
"But you can't speak the language, confound you," cries Maullie,
boiling over.
"Veil, um—um—um," retorts Jomp, hurt by this imputation; "she
don't understand vol I say."
Carried nem. con. for the twentie'h time—That, Jomp is an Ass. Also,
that we '11 get some one who does understand the Hague, and the
language.
It is now four o'clock.
Proposed by the Commander, that we drive to Scheveningen.
Seconded by Gooch heartily (he is always ready for anything in a
carriage), with an amendment to the effect that we have a biscuit, or
sandwich, and a glass of something first.
Generally agreed to. Carriage ordered.

Why the unfortunate Curate is to have £30 less for the second year
than for the first, we don't know. It is a reversal of the usual course
of reward. Is he expected to make all his flock so good, the first year,
that they will wast liMle looking after, subsequently P But that's a
trifle. As to the making of the Rector's Hay, "et cetera," we think
the advertiser should be more explicit. What else is the Curate to
make—tea, sermons, beds, bread, or whatP We have read of "the
et cetera oath," whicn was regarded as a snare—we dare say that no
snare is meant here, but business is business. Some curates are handy
and willing, some are awkward and haughty—for his own sake the
advertiser should say how much he expects, in addition to the discharge
of a clergyman's real duty, on a decreasing salary.
The writer of a leading article in the Morning Post, whose language,
all except, one word, is satisfactory, gives us the assurance that we have
a "reliable fleet." It is a comfort to know that we have a fleet
whereon we can rely. We understand what that means. The same
thing, doubtless, is meant by a "reliable fleet" in the mind of the
journalist who employs that expression; but he should not call the
British fleet reliable. The United States may have a reliable fleet if
you like, as the Americans like to say so, hut the fleet of the United
Kingdom is trustworthy, not reliable. We never had, and never shall
have, a reliable fleet. Britannia could not think of ruling the waves
by any such means It is derogatory to the dignity of England's naval
armament to associate it with an epithet derived from the phraseology
of Yankee cent-a-lining.
Chesterfield to the Rescue!
We must protest against brutal rudeness, even to brutes. We
read in the price lists that certain cattle are called, " Inferior Coarse
Beasts." This triple insult seems to us vulgar. We would hardly apply
such epithets to the riotous cads to whom the Victoria Embankment is
given up on Sundays.

WHICH OF THESE TWO RESPECTABLE PHILISTINES IS WAITER, WHICH HOST?
THE "GRATEFUL FATHER'S" REWARD.
Who says that Gratitude is evanescent P
"If Faith and Hope reply,
Give Faith and Hope the lie."
There is a " Grateful Father" who has been for months, if not years,
announcing, in cosily advertisements, that he is desirous of sending
"by mail, free of charge" a prescription by which his daughter " was
restored to perfect health from confirmed consumption, after having
been given up by her physicians." Mr. Punch, maintaining, though
with difficulty, command over his emotions, has wctched this worthy
creature's persistent demonstrations of gratitude. But further restraint
is impossible, and the Grateful Father must be aided in his praise-
worthy purpose. As he declares that he has nothing to gain by his
gratefulness, he can sustain no injury by the publication of the blessed
prescription; nay, his benevolent soul will exult to find that it is placed
before the world in Mr. Punch's colutnus. Yet, knowing that excessive
modesty oftens accompanies excessive goodness, that Gentleman has
forborne, in requesting a copy of the prescription, to mention the
reward it, is his intention to bestow; but now he clasps the Grateful
Father to bis bosom, and, with tears of Sacred Emotion, promises him
that he shall no longer do good in the way adopted by the late Mh.
Allln, of Ross, but, if so niiudt d, may "blush to find it fame."
'' LOCKE ON GOVERNMENT."
Making every allowance on account of the weather, the war, the end
of the Session, the late nights, and everything else of a disturbing
sort, is not this kind of thing rather strong P At 3 o'clock on a Tuesday
morning,
"Mr. Locke inquired whether Wisley-common was to be retained in tho
Bill or nut? He would not take any assurance except that of the Prime
Minister; for there were a number of individuals on trie Treasury Bench who
got up and said all sorts of things upou which nobody placed any reliance."
Mr. Locke is a shrewd man and a valuable Member, and like a
Macedonian of old, "calls a spade a spade." But it is out-Macedo-
nianing Macedonianism to indicate respectable officials by the name of
Apollo a musical instrument. That is being too classical.
"Scaldings."
An eminent firm announces a new poem under the title of The Scald.
The house in question seldom issues a weak book, yet, it is difficult to
understand how the dtscription of a comparatively slight injury, and of
its surgical treatment, can occupy six cantos. However, we trust that
the conclusion will be happy, and that the author will not scorn to
borrow an idea from a moaner minstrel, the author of The Perfect Cure.

A Paragraph headed "Tradesman's Frauds" appcired the other
day, in the Islington Gazette, stating that at the Islington Petty Ses-
sions in the previous week, ninety-one shopkeepers were convicted of
using illegal we ignis and measures. The different trades in which
these rogues cheated, and the number of rogues who disgraced each
trade, are very carefully specified by our Islington contemporary: but
these statistics are rendered useless by the omissiou of the rogues'
names. An Act of Parliament should provide that the
addresses of all such rogues shall be duly advertised.

becoming a soldier. Let the women drive the men to the frontier, and the
mothers curse the sons who are not ready to die. To arms! To arms 1"
"Great want of originality," continued Mr. Dogrose, on having
read the foregoing appeal. "' To arms !1 The old, old cry of aggressors
in trouble. Fancy yourself poking up a nest of hornets, bringing
them about your ears, and then shouting 'To arms! To arms!' Yah!
'Let the women drive the men to the frontier.' H'm! Of course, with-
out considering, if they don't remain there, in what a plight they
may come back. 'And the mothers curse the sons who are not ready
to die.' _ Ready, who is ready f Are yon, Reader f as the tracts say.

Felicity of Naval Nomenclature.
By a letter from Rome in the Constitutionnel we are apprised that:—
"The evacuation of the Pontifical territory by French troops continues, and
the steamer President Troplong has just embarked the remainder of the 6th
Foot Chasseurs."
Troplong seems a rather appropriate name for a transport employed
in completing the evacuation of Rome; which has certainly not taken
place a day too soon.

PITY THE SORROWS OF A VACATION JUDGE!
We notice every autumn with considerable pain that one of our
poor Judges is compelled to remain in town " at chambers," while all
bis learned brethren are shooting, fishing, tour-making, or otherwise
enjoying their annual vacation. How in our hearts we pity this poor
solitary Judge, thus shining a fixed star amid the firmament of law,
while the other legal luminaries are wandering like comets !' l is the
last Judge in chambers left blooming alone; all his learned companions
from London are gone. And what a bitter mockery it seems that he
should have the title of the "Vacation Judge," when he is thus cruelly
deprived of his vacation! We wonder that he does not strike work
altogether, and say, with Falstaff (slightly altered) "Why, 'tis my
vacation, Hal, 'tis a sin for any man to labour in his vacation!" Let
us hope, at any rate, that in general he finds there is but little work to
do, and that he has some pleasant indoor recreation. People should
know better than to go to law in August, when the lawyers want a holi-
day, and the Judges also. We trust that it would not be very far away
from truth were we to picture the Vacation Judge enjoying leap-frog
with his clerk, or indulging in such pastimes as a game of tops or
marbles.
Impudence and Assurance.
Mrs. Partington considers that a shipowner as would supply an
enemy with Coals shows he is just the sort of party as would Skuttle a
vessel of his own. She has not studied the question of contraband,
but her instinct is right.
PROBABLE CONVERTS.
It is a wonder that all the Aldermen of the City of London have not
become Catholics—on account of the numbers of Feasts in the Roman
Calendar.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 20, 1870.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
tjgtjst 6, Saturday. "Courage, lads,
1 see land!" as the ancient sage
remarked when he had been boring
his disciples by reading a dull book
aloud to them, and at, last drew near
the end thereof. Here beginnetli the
last, chronicle of the Session.
But first, note that this Sixth of
August, 1870, will be one of the Days
of History — a Punctum Temporis.
For on this Saturdiy did the Ger-
mans, under the Crown Prince en-
gage the French at VVoerth, and after
a battle that endured all day (splen-
did valour being shown on both sides),
the Germans routed the French. Ou
the same day. moreover, General
Steinmktz also routed them near
Forbacb. Certain glimmerings of
great political significance began to
dawn upon Europe.
To return to our Sheep. Lords
and Commons both met, and passed
many Bills. Among them the Meet-
ing of Parliament at Six Days'
Notice Bill, which Mr. Punch fervently hopes may become a remark-
ably defunct Dead Letter.
Monday. Foreign Minister Lord Granville explained that England
had proposed to Prussia and to France that they »hould enter into
treaty with her that if either the King or the Emperor should violate
the neutrality of Belgium, England should act with the other against
the Violator. This is to hold good for a year after peace shall be
made, and then we go back to the Treaty of 1839. Both Powers
assented. Now will anybody say that, Englaud— vide our last Cartoon—
did not mean what she said when she said to Belgium, "Trust me " P
It is agreeable to know that the Belgians are much pleased with ns,
and have warmly thanked our good Queen.
The Ecclesiastical Titles Bill had been to altered by the Lords that
Hie Commons had to alter it back again, and, the former cleaving to
their amendments, the Government withdrew the Bill. So Catholic
ecclesiastics are still exposed to the hideons tyranny under which they
have been groaning for so many years, and are as liable as before to be
burned, incarcerated, compelled to hide in the "Priest's Hole," and
generally to be persecuted for religion.
Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone, made a statement similar to that
of Lord Granville.
It was finally decided that the next Census shall be Irreligious.
Mr. Punch wonders whether there will be, this time, any Fanatic who
will refuse to make a return, because King David was punished for
numbering his people.
The Commons agreed to the Lords' decision, on the Clerical Dis-
abilities Bill, that a clergyman who has left the Church shall not be
allowed to come back again. Non licet bis errare is a rule of war, but
it is a new thing to apply it to the tortuosities of theology. However,
the Bishops know best, or it is their busiuess to know best.
Tuesday. Sir Rorert Collier, Attorney-General, becomes Recorder
of Bristol. New writ—but the Conservatives do not oppose his re-elec-
tion. Let the bells ring out for him in Bristol's loyal town, and ere the
day let three hundred horse meet him on Clifton down, if they like and
he likes, though we don't see the slightest reason for the operation.
Ha! ha! We wax jolly, at the thought of the end of the Session.
Mr. Jacor Bright and Sir Wilfrid Lawson objected to our
engagement to defend Belgium. But Mr,. Peter Taylor (and we re-
joice to shake hands with him before he goes to Leicester, or wherever
he lives) made as sound and manly a speech in favour of England's
doing her duty and keeping her word, as we desire to hear. We
hereby forgive him all his two-penny grievances about flogged cads
and the like, and slap him affably on the shoulder:
"So tho Proud Tailor goes marching away."
Wednesday. The Lords had a Belgian debate, by way of whet to the
prorogation. Lord Cairns cordially approved the object of the new
Treaty, but doubted the wisdom of an arrangement which might expose
us to awkward complications. Suppose a skilful strategist, in order to
get England on his side, compelled his adversary to violate the Belgian
soil!' And suppose both violated itP
Lord Granville did not see how the skilful strategist was to
manage such a stroke. He did not believe that either King or Em-
peror would, after a solemn treaty with us, proceed to break it. We
did not weaken the Treaty of 1830, but confirm it. Belgium had not
been consulted in the matter, as we did not want to compromise her,
but she had been apprised of the plan, and applauded it.
Lord Stratford de Redcltfpe (an authority), the Duke of
Cleveland, and Lord Shaptesrury (is this excellent nobleman
pleased that Protestantism is scoring honours':) highly approved of the
Treaty.
In the Commons, Mr. Gladstone said that Count Bernstorff had
signed for North Germany, and that M. Lav alette would sign as soon
as a formal power (since arrived) should come. There was a discus-
sion—we cannot blame Honourable Gentlemen for taking the last op-
portunity for a talk, but we should blame ourselves very considerably
if we obtruded such talk on an impatient Universe that is watching
battles. Suffice it to say, that those whose words have weight approved
what Ministers had done.
At two o'clock the signal was siven, and a few minutes later, Lord
Chancellor Hatherley had delivered the Royal Speech. It was as
brief as was compatible with dignity.
The Queen made befitting reference to (he War, and to the Pain
and Grief with which She witnessed it. Her Majesty adverlcd to Her
exertions to prevent it, noted her Declaration of Neutrality, and
described the Belgian Treaty.
Tho Sovereign alluded to the Greek atrocities, and Mr. Punch regrels
that she was not advised to say something stronger. Her unremitting
efforts would be directed to secure complete inquiry. [Please your
Majesty, we have been hearing of this for months. May we respectfully
say that your Majesty's subjects do not expect to see Greece permitted to
sneak out of the affair, merely because she is a miserable little country,
and tieo great nations are thundering in battle^
Our Monarch thanked the Commons for their liberality, and for the
additional grant of money for 20,000 new troops.
The Lady of the Land acknowledged the value of the labours that
have created
The Irish Land Act.
The Education Act.
[Excuse us, your Majesty, but permit us to say " Hooray!" and to
add a cheer for Ma, Forster.]
The Naturalisation Act.
The Extradition of Criminals Act.
The Improvement of the Enlistment System Act.
Finally Queen Victoria "bade Parliament farewell for the recess,
with the earnest prayer that when it should be again summoned, She
might be enabled to rejoice with it on the re-establishment of peace on
the Continent of Europe."
[So may it be. Madam, and the prayer is Hal of a good Queen and a
hind Lady. But there is stern work to be done before that day of
rejoicing.']
Thus endeth the "arduous" Session. Mr. Punch began to pTeach
a sermon to those whose fatal dislike of the Silences has made the
Session about three times as arduous as was necessary. But
"Ere he had said
His prelude through, the uncourteous souls had fled."
Therefore he will remark, as did the Irish Manager to the thin house,
"As there's nobody there, I dismiss you all." To the moor, to the hill,
to the sea! and may we not meet again until February. Potaturus vos
salulo ,' adds Mr. Punch, pensively handiug to his printer the last lines
of this Session's
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
A DIAPHORETIC DAY.
My cheek, but not my cheek alone,
My brow was also bathed in tears,
The weather had so sultry grown,
And they ran down my nose and ears.
A heavy haze obscured the sky,
Through which the sun by fits did glare;
I met a doctor, and, said I,
"There's James's Powder in the air."
Highly Bespectable Liquor.
"Claret Medoc, with bottled character." So say3 a placard on a
shop-window. We all know that it is as important for a wine to have
a character as it is for a servant; but, many of us now learn, for the
first time, that it can be bottled. How is the thing done; for this
feat, this new battle-trick, seems almost to be beyond even modern
ingenuity, and ought certainly, if practicable, to be a patented inven-
tion P Let us hope one thing, that if the wine's character is bottled, it
is not " corked" also.
IN A GREAT STATE OF ALARM.
There is one class of objects which always make Mrs. Malaprop'
feel very nervous when she goes to the Kensington Museum—the
terror cottas.

vast Aryan empire, long
foretold by the most
sagacious of her his-

tinax, long foreseen by
the most venerable of

culminated to an in-
tolerable apex under
the licentious sway of
the last of the once
powerful Meringues,
vain were all the well-
meant efforts of kings
and cavalry officers to ar-
rest its inevitable doom.
"Her commerce (in
otto of roses) once the
, envy and astonishment
of surrounding nations,
had ceased to disturb
the equanimity of the
most insignificant of
neighbouring States;
her exports and imports
(of marmalade and arti-
ficial mineral waters)
yielded neither gain to
the imperial treasury
nor profit to the adven-
turous trader: and the
richly-freighted shallops
that had floated on
and hoisted
On to Ocean's breast.

And woodbine scents the window-sill,
Then you and 1,
Beneath the sky,
Will calculate the weekly bill."

every sea,
the ' Combs and Brushes' in every harbour of the navigable globe, now lay silently
rotting on the deserted shores of the romantic estuaries of the melancholy Sprolk.
"The treasures of art, the wonders of science, the marvellous products of
inventive genius and the patent laws, reposed neglected and forgotten in galleries
and cabinets, in museums and mechanics' institutes—the ivories and alabasters,
the cameos and corkscrews, the subtle work of the sculptor, the goldsmith, and
the market gardener, all at the mercy of the barbarous invader; exciting the
cupidity and tempting the insatiable avarice of the most abandoned of her height
and sex, and finally leading the way to that momentous disturbance of the
equilibrium of nations which terminated iu t he disruption of the entire Peninsula,
and is felt even to this day in the remotest fastnesses of the City Road."—Gieron.
t
"I wander in the meadows at eventide. I drink in the sweet scents of the
mignonette in the fragrant hedgerows, of the Pyrus Japonica in the adjoining cop-
iice, of the Myosolis palustris in the adjacent fox-cover. I stand for half an
iour watching the sensitive blossoms of the tender orchis shrink nervously before
the first shades of approaching night, and see the gleaming chalice of the Victoria
regia brimming with the fertilising dews of the bounteous heavens.
"All Nature is unobtrusively serene and still. The lapwing's carol is hushed,
and the song of the beetle-crusher has faded on the ear of listening night; the
hare is in her form, the catalpa on her mossy nest; that busy engineer, the
indefatigable mole, slumbers in his own earthworks, and the glowworm's light is
turned off at the meter. There is not a sound on the horizon, there is not a
creature in the back premises. I will retrace my steps along t his secluded bridlc-
rith, I will tread care fully among the edible fungi on the grassy lawn—what thanks
owe the wise Professor who taught me in my boyish hours to distinguish between
the delicious mushroom and the deleterious toad-stool—and return to my ten-pound
tenement, for the night is chilly, and I fear arthritic rheumatism, having forgotten
my great-coat."—Linn^us.
We will conclude with a quaint old madrigal :—
"When Phoebus from his couch is springing,
Curtained in the east,
When feathered throats are sweetly singing
Over Nature's feast,
When night retreats and darkness hies,
And zephyrs breathe, and Mora sighs,
Then you and I,
Beneath the sky,
Will watch the day-star ere he dies.
"When Phoebus to his bed is going,
Shrouded in the west,
When purling streams are swiftly flowing
WOMAN "TAKING ACTION."
Under the head of Sporting Intelligence, "Argus,"
the entertaining and instructive Correspondent of the Post,
observes:—
"The action for Breach of Promise brought last week against
a member of the Ring, has, as may be imagined, caused con-
siderable amusement among that body; and I hope I may be
allowed to say what the general feeling is upon the subject—viz.
that the jury have handicapped Mr, M,•••'i very high; and
considering what a heavy bookmaker he is, it will require a good
many ' ouUiders' to win during the Octobers at Newmarket
for him to recoup himself of the money, out of which the jury
have done him."
O Argus !" Done" him P A British Jury, no doubt
composed of respectable, if not large, shopkeepers, capa-
ble, do you think, of doing," by excessively amercing
in damages, anybody in any case, and of all cases in a
breach of promise of marriage case P If they gave damages
at all heavy, depend upon it the case was a very gross
case indeed. What! Is it not to be presumed that they
were twelve honest Englishmen, family men as well as
men of business; men, probably with grown-up daughters
or marriageable sisters P Can you suppose that such men
would encourage an extortionate action which the mere
idea of bringing would shock all the good, generous, un-
selfish, loving girls, their relations P Such dear girls would
shudder at the thought of trying to sell themselves to a
man by marrying him merely for a maintenance, of holding
him to his bargain if he repented of it, and, if he broke
it, trying to screw money out of him. Their fathers and
brothers would never put a premium on heartless self-
seeking, like that. No, no, Argus. The honourable, if
small, British tradesman would despise his own daughter
if he suspected her of such baseness. The breadth of mind
and view, peculiar to his class, moreover enables him to
perceive that actions for breach of matrimonial contract
ought to be generally discouraged if only on prudential
grounds by men wishing to get their daughters off their
hands; because no man in his senses would ever marry
any woman who had been a plaintiff in one.
However, if any unfortunate fellow has really been, as
Argus says, " done" by a jury in their verdict of damages
against him for having broken an engagement to wed a
person for whom he had ceased to care, there is this con-
solation for him, that the heaviest fine is preferable to the
bonds of enforced matrimony. He may, besides, thank his
stars that he did cease to care for one not worth caring
for, in time. If the member of the King named by Argus
has in truth been "done" in the way which Argus men-
tions, he should reflect that no fine is so heavy as the yoke
of slavery to that other ring which he has escaped at all
events, and which, had he not escaped it. would perhaps
make him wish that he were under the Turf instead of on it.

Foreign Affairs.
In the Post the other day it was thus written :—
"The British Embassy was stormed by peaceful British sub-
jects asking for passports. Paris will ere long, contain very few
foreigners."
Let us hope it may not too soon contain a great many.

MRS. KAMSBOTHAM.
Mrs. Ramsrotham has taken a cottage in the country. She can't
go abroad this year on account of the war. She writes to a friend quite
a poetical description of her rural retreat. She says: "The landlord,
who has gone away for three months, was evidently very fond of rare
plants. There's a beautiful Awkward House, always kept hot with a
tank in it, and little green frogs at eighteen pence a head. This is
where Awkwards grow. They 're of no use, and some of them are very
lovely. Then there's an Infirmary, with the most gracious ferns I
ever saw, some of them growing oat of pots and some out of banks,
the banks being covered with bunches of green Moses. The walls of
the cottage are hardly visible on account of the ivory growing all over.
Creepers come in at the bedroom windows, and by the river-side there
are plenty of weeping Willies. Creepers and weepers. As to fruit, we
have apples, pears, greengages, and as there is, I am told, a pine-wood
somewhere near, I've no doubt that we could find plenty of pine-
apples in the neighbourhood. There are (as for vegetables) cucumbers,
quite pictures in frames, and vegetable Marys growing out of doors.
There are hot-houses all about, which perhaps makes this rather a cold
house, that is, by caparison. The grapes are lovely, and quite sour,
but plenty of them, which makes Mr. Filmer's son-in-law say (he is
what they call a wag, or a wig, though I don't understand politics),
that though we don t want to put on our best dresses in the country,
yet we have plenty of vinery. We've got a Miranda before the dining-
room window, which is a cover to go under when it rains. This
Miranda is paved with desolated tiles, the same as you see in the
cathedrals and churches. Do you know the difference between a
cathedral and a church P I '11 tell you, as our good Vigour explained
it. 'A cathedral,' says he, 'is a sort of church lor the ordinary; and
the other is merely an ordinary church.'
"' Ordinary,' it appears, means ' Bishop': I thought it always meant
dinner at one o'clock, a sort of Tarble Doat, as they say abroad. We've
got a fearful lot of VVoppses here; and we spend our breakfast-time
hordy atmbar (to coat the French) with our knives and forks and
spoons in our hands, and our napkins waving about to keep 'em off.
Mr. Filmer, Junius, he says that they can't sting if you only get hold
of 'em and punch 'em to death. Crudat Dufays, as the Romans say.
"Yours warmly,
"Lavinia D. Ramsrotham."
AN HONEST IRISHMAN.
In the Irish Sportsman and Farmer (an interesting journal of the
Field class) we read—
"A certain gentleman—we name no names—proposing himself, by adver-
tisement, for a city office—we define no further—says, if he be elected, he will
perform his duties with ability, and to everybody's satisfaction."
Why name no names P We should like to know the gentleman. He
is straightforward enough to say point-blank what every other candidate
for office says with a circumbendibus. We admire his frankness. He
has taken a leaf out of Mr. Punch's book, and whosoever does that,
prospers, for it is a gold leaf he takes.
Germans, Great and Small.
In consequence of the war now raging between the two chief military
nations of Europe, there will be, it is feared, a scarcity of German
sausages. But, on the contrary, the probability is that we shall have a
glut of them. Recollect that the troops engaged on both sides will
include cavalry.

cent even's. From that

gable "gatherer of other

AN IMP AMONG THE INNOCENTS.
_ Along with the Innocents some Imps have been massacred this
time. One of these is the Enclosure Bill dropped for the present. It
may be enacted another day though, if you don't look sharp. It still
remains a project, which, according to the Secretary of the Commons'
Preservation Society, proposes to authorise twenty-one enclosures,
containing an area of 12,596 acres, 7232 of which are subject to public
allotments, and:—
"From the whole of this only sixty-three and a half acres are reserved for
exercise and recreation, and only eighty-nine acres as allotments for the
labouring poor. Several of the Commons proposed to be enclosed are in the
neighbourhood of large towns, and one of them, embracing the Lizard Point
and Kycance Core, in Cornwall, comprises scenery of unusual beauty."
The credit of slaughtering the imp which threatened to do the mis-
chief above indicated, marring English scenery, and conveying (the
wise call it,) public land, is due to Propessor Fawcett. If this
goblin of a Bill, for the present quelled, should come to life again, and
affront us with its ugly figure next Session, may the public-spirited
Propessor, the Member for Brighton, be again prompt and potent to
knock it on the head, and stamp upon it, and squelch it.
Only their Name Against Them.
"The investment of Strasbourg appears, as fir as yet learned, to bo con-
ducted chiefly by the Badieh troops."
It is not at all improbable that these " Badish" troops may show
themselves to be goodish ones.
The Cover of the Country.
An eye-witness of the Battle of Woerth, describing it in the Nationale,
mentions that "every tree" in the forest of Hagenau "concealed a
Prussian, who took a sure aim," and particularly notices "the terrible
part that the woods, whether at Forbach or elsewhere, play in this
war." Guardians of British Crown Lands, please to bear in mind that
our Woods are among the most important of our national defences.
THE VISION OF BABYLON.
The dream that caused the Great King sore unrest
As on his bed in Babylon he lay—
The image terrible, in brightness drest,
With golden head, and silver arms and breast,
Belly and thighs of brass, and, for a stay,
Feet moulded part of iron, part of clay—
Do we too dream that dream, that image see to-day P
The stone cut without hands do we behold,
Smiting the image on its faithless feet,
Till clay and iron, silver, brass and gold,
Are broken into fragments manifold
As chaff on threshing-floors blown from the wheat,
And scattered to the winds that fiercely beat
Bound that huge wreck of strength areared upon deceit!
Such is the vision! Needs no seer to tell
Vision's interpretation, while the Time
Helps our dull brains its lessonings to spell;
How willi base metals noble mix not well;
How homeward comes the curse of craft and crime,
To weaken iron wills, as did the slime
Those iron feet, whereon that image showed sublime t
The clay of treachery and broken oaths,
Kneaded with blood in midnight murder shed—
What iron but such foul admixture loaths P
What rooted mights of such seed take their growths P
Where to serve silver arms, or golden head,
Or brazen belly, ne'er so fatly fed,
Upon those feet, how firm soe'er they seem to tread P
Lo, the stone without hands! Two nations' wrath:
This—banded to protect its hearths and homes,
One will, one heart, one hand, set on the path
Of the invader, who, like him of Gath,
Exulting in his strength and stature comes,
To sweep them from his road, nor thinks he dooms
His own France to defeat and overthrow, like Home's
When she assailed those she was wont to call
Barbarians—the sires of them that now
Teach France the lesson to be learnt of all
Whose moods like straw-fires flare as swift as fall,
That 'tis not lust of conquest that can bow,
Their patient wills, their silent strengths can cow,
Whom Faith and Fatherland thus with one soul endow.
And thai—the other nation—rising mad
To ask, " What with our legions hast thou done P"
To clamorous cursing changed from war-songs glad,
For blithesome looks, dark faces, sore and sad,
And set like flint, 'gainst him—taeit Lord—their One—
The sole will of their world—the central sun
Bound which the ordered stars had but their course to run.
What wonder, if beneath these rending blows,
The foes without, the feller fues within,
The strength of the great image melts, like snows
In thaw, and cracks and rends, with awful throes —
If the clay kneaded in its feet, begin
To work its work of weakness 'neath the skin
Whose vain and varnished show the world's respect could winP
Lo, the great image seen in Babylon,
In King Neruchadnezzar's slumber deep,
For our good once more in its mould is ruu:
Again we see the welded strength undone,
Because it lacked Bight's base that strength to keep:
Once more he that sowed wind doth whirlwind reap:
Once more we learn God's wrath may stay, but doth not sleep.
Pensive Penning.
Being in a poetic vein, I stood by a child's cradle, and saw the infant
smiling in its sleep. Here," said 1 to myself, " is Blissful Inno-

A TRIP TO SCHEVENINOEN—THE DRIVEWOMP'S INFORMATION—
MAULLIE'S JOKES—A DISCOVERY—A SKETCHING PARTY—BUND AND
HIEROQLYPHICS-THE ETABLISSEMENT.
Scheveningen.—"Scheveningen," says Bund, authoritatively, "is a
small fishing village three miles from the Hague, containing eight
thousand inhabitants."
Gooch asks if he has counted them.
Bund, entering into the joke, replies that he has, and finds Murray's
number exact.
Maullie, R.A., observes, "ExactP I wonder at that: I should
have thought you'd have found several short."
This is Maullik's fun. It throws a gloom over the party for the re-
mainder of the drive, which had begun very pleasantly. Gooch's
friends (both in a rumble, hooked on specially for them, and evincing a
strong tendency towards detaching itself from the main body of the
carriage) beg that Maullik's joke may be repeated to them. It is re-
sted! Consequence, one short laugh, and then meditative silence and
peated
folded
We take Jomp with as, because he has been instructed as to the
beauties of Scheveningen by the landlord of the hotel, and we suppose
that for once he is well posted up in the subject.
We see a large house, apparently of Italian architecture, among the
trees. Bund attracts Jomp's attention by poking him in the back
with his stick, much in the same manner as the keepers rouse the
sleeping animals in a travelling menagerie, or a passenger wishes to
intimate to the 'bus conductor that he's a long way past where he
ought to have been set down."
"Ask Aim," says Bund, meaning the coachman, "what that place
is."
Jomp turns round again, and mumbles some soft, very soft, nothings
in the coachman's ear.
The coachman makes some reply, evidently not understanding one
word used by the intelligent Jomp, who tries again, going in at the con-
versation this time with his head and arms. The coachman nods,
shakes his head, and laughs • then turns to us over his shoulder and,
taking us into the joke, laughs again.
"He thinks Jomp mad," says Gooch, decisively.
"Hey P What P" ask Muntley and Finton, in the rumble.
N.B. The worst of having fellows in the ramble, who want to be
sociable, is that everything said in the carriage has to be repeated to
them, as if it were being interpreted. I give them, conscientiously, a
sort of pricis of the conversation and the circumstances leading up to
what Gooch has just said, and they reply together, " Oh!" A sort of
chorus in the rumble.
Bund says afterwards, "A ramble is only for servants." Maullie
replies, " Yes, your rumble servants." Another gloom over the party.
One laugh, and then Gloom.
"What does he say?" asks Bund of Jomp, still bent upon knowing
what the Coachman knows about the House which we've passed a
quarter-of-an-hour ago.
"He say," replies Jomp, in despair of ever making any Dutchman
understand him, "He say—uni-um-um—he say it is nothing—um-
um—he doesn't know."
"Bat you didn't explain," continues Bund, perseveringly.
"I explain," returns the unhappy Jomp, " but," he adds, shrugging
his shoulders, as an expression of pity for the coachman's want of
education. "he vill not onderstand vot I say: he come from somevhere
else."
This, henceforth, is Jomp's excuse whenever a Dutch person does
not understand his (Jomp's) language: which case is of perpetual
occurrence, the sole exceptions being when, by some lucky chance, the
Hollander speaks English, or can interpret Jomp's Swiss-French.
Jomp's theory (a Boompje theory) is that there is some part of Holland
where a number of people come from, who neither understand nor speak
their own language.
_ A pretty drive finishing with a newly-made road and young trees on
either side, brings us to Schevening, or, as Murray will have it, "Sche-
veningen," throwing a syllable in for luck as it were.

We drive on until we stick in a sort of dry marsh of fine sand, into
which the horses sink nearly up to their knees, and our wheels up to
their axles. Further progress is impossible. An idea strikes the in-
telligent Jomr, who turns to us from his perch on the box and says,
"ViI I you stop here P"
Under the circumstances our reply is that we will, whereupon Jomp
descends, opens lhe door, and we step as lightly as possible on to the
sand.
Gooch and his friends being in low shoes protest in forcible language,
and stand still, looking about for leu sand.
Bund, preceded by Jomp with the bag and umbrella, ascends the
hillock which commands the beach, and Maullie, after shading his
eyes with his hand for a minute-and-a-half, as if looking about where to
take Scheveningen unexpectedly, commences cutting a pencil by way
of coming to the point as soon as possible.
"Coming to the point" was Muntlby's joke, and would have been
highly successful (as no doubt he has found it on several other previous
occasions) but for the sand in our shoes, the unpleasant walking, the
hot sun, the peculiarly strong odour of nsb, (not unlike that of a poor
quarter of London on a Saturday night) and the improbability of our
being able to get any refreshment "except perhaps, fays Gooch, in
a tone of unmitigated disgust, " tea and shrimps." N.B. Always care-
fully select your time to be funny, or else—Boompje!
Jomp makes a discovery. (Boompje!!) He sees in the distance an
itablissenent, and with a view to ingratiating himself with Gooch, points
it out to him privately.
Gooch, Huntley and Finton are delighted.
"By Jove!" exclaims Gooch, whose mind at once reverts to Trou-
vi! If, Dieppe, and Boulogne. "I dare say there 's a band there, and a
restaurant."
"And lota of people," suggests Muntley.
"And the French papers; the Figaro," suggests Fixton, this being
the only French paper he knows.
"Do you know," Gooch asks of Jomp, who has suddenly inspired
him with confidence on account of his discovering the itablissement, " if
there is a promenade here P" Muntley and Fixton both listen anxiously
for the answer. A promenade to them means lounging about vaguely,
examining the toilettes of the ladies, remarking upon Doosid pretty
girls those," asking one another, "Who 'a that? d' you know P"
smoking cigarettes, settling their ties, coaxing their collars, and keep-
ing their wristbands well, en evidence, by dint of perpetual pulling up
and shooting out their arms as if engaged in some species of gymnastic
exercise. This last performance. by the way, Muntley terms flashing
his linen." As the Count and his friends would be perfectly happy to
pass their afternoon in this simple fashion, they are all ears for Jour's
answer concerning the promenade.
"Oh yes," replies Jomp, with such an air of certainty as would
make any one who knew him receive bis information with a consider-
able amount of caution. "Dere is a promenade."
"Where P" asks Finton.
"Oh," returns Jomp, as if to put such a question was utterly absurd,
"Vere r—'ere." He extends his arms on either side in the attitude of
a street juggler chucking the balls and knives, and looks from right to
left,, and then from left to right, thereby taking'in the whole line of the
seashore of Schevening.
"But they don't walk about in this sand P" exclaims Gooch, who
sees no sign, except the existence of the ilablissement, of anything like
a fashionable promenade.
"Oh yes." retorts Jomp, "Dey valk in de sand." He thinks it out
and adds, Dere's no vere else."
"I wish we'd known it was a fashionable place," says Gooch,
"we'd have got Maullie another hat at the Hague."
M aullie is on the sands, sketch-book and pencil out.
Muntley and Finton goto inspect the ilablissement: they are to
return and report to Gooch. Bund has followed Maullie, and is
pointing out to him what he ought to draw.
Maullie is sketching one of the hundred and fifty picturesque
fishing-boats which are waiting for the tide in order to put out to sea,
and is carefully noting down all the details. Bund is pointing out a
boy with a dog in a totally different direction from that where Maul-
lie's eyes are engaged. "I say," exclaims Bund, who flatters himself
on a great appreciation of the picturesque, "there's a bit for you to
draw."
"Eh P" says Maullie, steadily continuing his boat.
"Boy with dog," Bund goes on, as if he was settling the name of
the picture in next year's Academy Catalogue, "and fishing-basket.
Just look what a quaint old fishing-basket."
Maullie pooh-poohs the suggestion, whereupon Bund sets to work
to make what he calls just an artistic memorandum, which, he informs
u«, conveys more to hit mind, subsequently, than any writing could do.
What it may convey to hi* mind, it is impossible to say; but having
seen the original of the sketch, it is quite certain that this is not con-
veyed to our minds by what may be called the Boompje hieroglyphic.
The Commander, Bund, is always " dashing off," as he calls it, a Utile
sketch.
"There's the basket; and boy; and dog," he exclaims, with an air of
artistic pride, handing the fly-leaf of Murray (he generally does them
in some odd corners of books, or on scraps of paper, preserved after-
wards in his pocket-book) to us for inspection.
I say, "Yes," doubtfully; but add, I suppose that'1l recall to your
mind the whole scene;" i. e., Schevening, the sand, the one hundred and
fifty boats, the crowd of costumes, the itablksement, the huts, the
houses, the carts, the sunset, the sea, &c., &c.
Gooch observes, "That it's a great thing to be able to sketch."
Our opinions are, perhaps, somewhat biassed by the remembrance
of the constitution under which as a Club, we are travelling; t. e., that
the Commander Bund is Paymaster.
Jomp. who is evidently trying to recover his position in the Com-
mander s estimation, looks over his elbow at the drawing, and says,
sagely—
'Ab, yes, um—um—um," he is considering the subject—"it is very
goot. Yes, oh yes—dere is de luetic dog," and he carefully point* out
what Bund intended for the basket.
Gooch and myself side with Jomp an this occasion only. We say,
"Yes, the dog is very good; it's the animal itself in a few touches.
For the matter of that, it's about as much like ft bathing-machine
as a dog, but Bund (who had intended it for the basket, or the boy,
but certainly not the dog, there is no doubt about it, from the angry
expression of his countenance, when he vu going to retort upon
Jomp) takes all the credit he can for the cleverness of the sketch, and
to prevent any future mistakes, labels the thing, which we had settled
upon as representing the dog, with a "D," and then, entirely mistrust-
ing his own powers and intention, asks us knowingly, which *»« should
say was the boy.
We choose, out of the two remaining figures, the boy (of course, it
is the basket, though Gooch has some doubts upon the point), and
Bund labels that No. 2, with a reference below: thus, No. 2, the Boy,
and No. 3, the Basket, adding a line to the effect that the above is a
Sketch taken on Schevening Beach, Sunset.

A GOOD NAME.
What it in a Name P Something. For instance, there's a pecu-
liarly chuckling sort of look about an educational advertisement headed
"GIGGLES'WICK GRAMMAR-SCHOOL."
The School for the Giggleswick Grammar must be an amnsing place,
and the Giggleswick Grammar itself a most entertaining, and also, of
course, a moat instructive book.
Giggleswick, we discover, is near Settle, in Yorkshire. Probably
the natives do not appreciate the advantages of Giggleswick so much
as do the Settlers. New Boys," says the Giggleswick (it's a delight-
ful name!—so cheery!) advertisement, "should come to the school at
two o'clock on the 22nd of August." We would like to be there as a
New Boy: that being impossible, we must content ourselves with going
down in our popular character of The Old Boy. "The dormitories,
continues the Giggleswickian advertisement, have "separate cubicles."
How charming, now ecstatic, to sleep in a Giggleswickian cubicle!
But stay, what is a cubicle P Did we ever sleep in a cubicle P No;
we should as soon have thought of slumber in a bicycle. "Cubicle"
is, we suppose, a translation of cubiculum, that is, with due deference
to the Giggleswickian Professors. A cubiculum was a bedchamber.
There were cubicula diurna et nocturia, to quote Smith, who quotes
Plint, and the nocturna were also called dormiioria. But Giggleswick
says that the dormiioria contain cubiculr. Wheels within wheels, that
is, rooms within rooms; Giggleswick all over. There is yet another
meaning for cubiculum, the pavilion or tent in which Roman emperors
were accustomed to witness the public games." Perhaps this is the
idea of the Cubiculum Giggleswickxum, or Giggleswickian Cubicle. No
doubt there are plenty of games in the dormitory, bolstering, for ex-
ample; and perhaps the big boys or monitors recline in their cubicles
while Fourth Form gladiators contend. This may be the Giggles-
wickian sense of cubicle. But as " on application" the Giggleswickian
Head Master (it sounds pantomimic, a Master with a Giggleswickian
head) "will give any further information," we can only refer ourselves
to him; and wishing him and his "health and happiness," with the
additional Jeffersonian-Rip-van-Winkleish wish "that he may live long,
and prosper," we finish by flinging our College cap in the air, and crying,
"Success to Giggleswick!"
A COMPLIMENT.

his sermon.

"thepeople were very much pleased P Eh P"
"Well, you see, your Lordship," replied the official, "our folks
would like to know summat about it; and"
"Ah!" interposed the Bishop, complacently, "I see they'd like to
read it at home.
"Well, your Lordship, that's just what they would like; 'cos"
(here he paused, and then added, confidentially) "it wor very hot

aullie near the boats, and
beckoning as to join him;
his whole action is as
stealthy as that of a doer-
stalker, or of a somebody
who's found something dan-
gerous asleep, and is going
to take its head off. _ We
join him. A fish auction is
going on.
Carts, empty, are dashing
down the beach, driven by
boys in comnund of one,
two, or three horses, and
being dragged up again
heavily laden. There is a
fair sprinkling of men, but
the auctioneering seems to
be chiefly carried on by
women. Children, appa-
rently belonging to anybody
or everybody, are running
about and amusing them-
selves with fish. Dogs,
with feline tastes, are growl-
ing over and munching fish
wholesale and retail. Boys
are throwing fish to one
another. Men are bring-
ing in baskets of fish, or taking ont baskets of fish, or lading carts,
or trays, with fish, or unlading other carts, or other trays, over-
laden with fish, or talking either about the fish they've got, or the 1
prospects of catching more fish, and a few strangers are buying what is
not already bespoke, and everybody on or about the spot is doing some-
thing or other with fish, and the whole place smells of fish, and there
are no meadows, nor grass-lands anywhere near, where you might get
a third course of cutlets, or a piece de resistance in the shape of a leg of
mutton. But the fish have if. all to themselves at Schev«ning, and the
people make a perfect jour maigre of every one of the 365 days in the
year.
"I've got something," whispers Maullie confidentially to me.
He is dodging behind a fish-cart, with his sketch-book in one hand and
his pencil in the other.
"What the Boomp je is the matter with MaullieP" asks Gooch,
whose sense of propriety here, with the chance of a promenade, is
being utterly outraged by this eccentricity on Maullie's part.
"He '11 have a crowd," he adds, observing two or three little fishy
boys already evincing an interest in Maullie's proceedings.
At last we find out what Maullie has "got." It is a very tall,
hulking, gawky fisherman, in a costume composed, apparently, of
various contributions most thankfully received by the present wearer.
He is a difficult subject to sketch, as he won't keep himself in view
(he can't help keeping his head in view, except when he disappears
behind a fishing-smack, which he does occasionally as a short cut to
some other crowd gathered ronnd a fish auctioneer), and Maullie has
to dodge him, in and out, between carts, to wait for him outside some
small crowd into which he has plunged, and out of which he will
struggle presently (his head being visible the whole time), when Maullie
will follow him round a boat, he on one side, the tall fisherman on the
other, like the pantomime business of the Clown and the Soldier round
a sentry-box, until making a bad shot, as to which way his uncon-
scious model is coming, he and the tall fisherman bump up against one
another (Boomp-je !!) face to face, that is, as nearly as possible, allow-
ing for their respective heights. From this moment the situation is
reversed. Hitherto it has been the Gigantic Model unconsciously
escaping from the Artist, now it is the Artist, painfully conscious,
escaping from the Gigantic Model.
"Frankenstein" says Bund, thinking the simile peculiarly happy.
"Yee," says Gooch, who imagines that Bund is saying something to
him in German which he ought to understand. The Gigantic Fisherman, 1
who really appears to have grown more grim and a foot taller, evi-
dently suspects mischief. If Maullie retires behind a cart, just to
"sketch in " the eye, or the nose, or a patch in his coat, the Giant is'
down upon him round the corner, with such a real expression of interest
in his eye, as makes Maullie shut up his book and walk off: man
following.
Maullie behind a boat: man after him. Maullie, taking a flying
sketch, retreating toward the hillock of sand near the town: man aft er
him, as if in seven-league boots. A stop. Maullie just sketching
man's boots. Man, scowling fiercely, advances. I
Gooch's opinion: "There '1I be a row. 'Pon my soul I don't wonder
at it. How would Maullie like to be followed about if he was at
home, and sketched and stared at by a stranger P If I was the man,"
adds Guoca, emphatically, as if with a view to preserve subsequent
neutrality, "I should punch his head."
J611 p. sniffing, like the war-horse, the scent of battle, says, unlike
the war-horse, that he'1l go and see after the carriage; and instantly
disappears. His reason, given afterwards is, to say the least of it,
honest: "I tought," says he, "dat dere'd be a fight."
Cessation of hostilities in consequence of Maullie's pocketing his
book and pencil. G'gintic man retires slowly, turning occasionally to
look back at Maullie, evidently still uncertain as to whether he
oughtn't to have punched his head, or got something out of him before
leaving. They couldn't have " come to terms" in any language common
to both, but fists are of universal application.
Muntlet and Finton come back, disgusted. The itablissement is
closed. There is no one there. Jomp is (of course) wrong: there is
no promeuade, except in the season.
On our return, we find that Bund, who knows some people at the
Hague, is asked to an evening party, and his friends are included in
the invitation.
Gooch is delighted; he says he likes Continental dances, and imme-
diately begins humming a can-can, and jerking his head with such a
knowing air, as to send his friends Muntlet and Finton into
ecstasies. When he finishes,—which he does abruptly,—they all laugh
together, as if over some secret reminiscence.
Maullie thinks the party rather a bore, but still he says it doesn't
matter to him, as he has no dress clothes with him.
"You can't go as you are," Gooch puts in, hastily.
Maullie replies, that if he wants to go he can borrow a suit from
the landlord.
Bund wishes he hadn't met his friends, the De Wokdes, who have
given him this invitation, and to whom he couldn't say no.
The Secretary (myself) is pleased. There would be a mixed society
of Dutch, French, German, and English.
After dinner I open my portmanteau, where I had expected to find
my new evening suit, fresh from the tailor's on my leaving England,
and still wrapped up in i's brown paper. I open it. I only find a
uniform, that of the Southwick Volunteers, which I had lately joined.
The tailor had sent them home by mistake. The uniform is not un-
pretty, being grey with a gentle shade of blue (so as to mingle you
with clouds in the distance, and make you a difficult object to hit)
and trimmed uo and down with a paleish canary yellow, with braided
cord on the cuffs and shoulders, and wherever, in fact, there is room
for it, and where there isn't a button.
"Go," says Gooch, " in the uniform."
I treat such a suggestion with contempt.
Bund thinks the idea is reasonable. He doesn't see why not.
Maullie thinks it would give a little colour to the scene. So do I.
Gooch says, " Why not P adding, that, if he was in my position,
he'd go " before you could wink your eye."
Bund asks what rank I hold.
I answer that I don't know, but they've promised me a captaincy
when I get buck, and know my drill.
Maullie says that any English officer in uniform is received any-
where. (Bo»mp-je!)
I am doubtful of this. I am further doubtful as to whether I come
under the description of " any Euglish officer in uniform."
Gooch says, "Certainly, of course. If not, what are youP EhP"
That's where it is—What amiP What is a VolunteerP When
abroad P
Boompje Riddle.—When's a Volunteer not a Volunteer P—When
he's abroad.
I try to turn it off with this. But they won't hear of it.
Muntley and Finton won't go if I don't go, and 1 don't go if my
uniform doesn't go, with me inside it.
Gooch hopes I won't be selfish. Bund gives as his opinion that
he'» sure I won't. Maullie offers to do my portrait in colours, "as I
appeared " if I '11 only go.
I ask, do they seriously mean that I can go in this costume P
They say, "Certainly," of course; and Gooch brings in his eye-
winking formula again, in proof of his readiness.
I agree, and promise to go.
Gooch announces that we ought to be "thinking of dressing"
(another formula of his for expressing that it is high time to be actu-
ally getting ready, or for even being nearly ready), and gives us the
railway time.
Jomp has ordered the carriage. We dress. While dressing, I have
my doubts.
In the coat, alone I feel I could go; it is decidedly handsome. The
trousers I dou't like. They are grey, and bear a decided resem-
blance to the colour of a convict's at hard labour. To go to a private
ball, which is not fancy dress, as half convict, half soldier (of some
sort), is not, it seems to me, to represent the Euglish to advantage.
Then, again, I reason with myself, sitting on the bed, meditating,

"They" (the Dutch) "won't know what I am "—like Watts's little
star. The English will. Perhaps they '11 sneer: nnless they stick up
for the honour of England, and Boompje a little about the Volunteer
Contingent.
This name decides me. The " Volunteer Contingent."
Question.—What, are you P
Answer.—An Officer in the Contingent.
I jump up from my bed. Boompje! 1 sat down, Myself, a South-
wick Volunteer, and rise an Officer in the. Contingent. The True
Boompje Spirit does wonders.
With a light heart I dress.
I debate with myself whether I won't wear a white waistcoat, so as
to show my watch-chain, and the coat open.
Question, then, how about collars P
If collars, shan't I look more like naval than military P Recollect
dining at a mess once with Regulars. They wore collars. The more
I think of this, the more uncertain I become.
I decide upon trjing it, and asking Goocu's opinion. (He is a good
hand at dress.)
He says, "Pooh! collars and open uniform! They '11 fancy you 're
somehow connected with the River Police."
Maullie, dressed in the landlord's clothes, which, he says, will
allow for growing, is ready. He, speaking "as an artist," gives it
against the white waistcoat.
"Button up," says he. I do.
At the House. 1 create a sensation in the hall, bat do not seem to
command respect. Am introduced to the lady of the house (an English-
woman married to a Dutchman, and living at the Hague), and she
welcomes me with a high-bred courtesy.
Shall 1 apologise, or not, for coming in uniform P
A NICETY IN NAMES.
he Red Tndians have their
Pipe of Peace, but a British
tobacconist in the City of
London commends a meer-
schaum, exhibited inhisshop-
window, to public patronage,
by labelling it "The War
Pipe." Fancy the enjoyment
of your smoke enhanced by
reflection on its contrast
with "the war-clouds rolling
dun" over the field of battle
or the bombarded town.
Suave mari magna, fyc. This,
perhaps, was the thought
which inspired the British
tobacconist.
Of course, we shall soon
have the music-shop fronts
garnished with highly illu-
minated book covers of
"Quadrilles " and " Galops"
entitled Weissemburg,
Woerth, and Forbach;
dance-tunes named after
sanguinary battles. Solferino
and Magenta were utilised
for the nomenclature of jigs;
60, doubtless, will be all the serious encounters between the French
and the Germans. A lively device, this, whereby what heavy, thinking
persons call the "horrors of war" are all " turned to favour and to
prettiness."
But why stop short at War Dance Music P Why not have Famine
Music and Pestilence Music, as well P Could not some papilionaceous
composer of measures appropriate to the light fan'astic toe produce,
on occasion, a "Starvation PolkaP" And then, should opportunity
serve, the music-sellers might bring out a " Scarlatina Polonaise," or a
"Typhus Mazurka," by the same or a similar man of genius, to whom,
also, the next cold easterly wind might hint the composition of an
'' Influenza Waltz," or a " Catarrh Quadrille."

Most Interesting.
The Westminster Scholars are reported to have in preparation a real
novelty for their play this year. A oue-act farce has been discovered
in MS.; date uncertain; but from internal evidence it may be fairly
supposed to belong to the Terentian age. It is entitled Batbus et Cuius.
There are only three characters, viz., Balbus, Cains, and Btincerir.
There is nothing new under the sun, and it really appears as if we had
at last hit upon the original of Box and Cox.
JUDICIAL VIEW OF WIVES.
At Guildford, the other day, for feloniously killing his wife, by kick-
ing and beating her to death, one Mahoney, a labourer, was sentenced
to eight months' imprisonment and hard labour. This was a sentence
of some severity in the estimation of the Judze who passed it. So,
at least, his Lordship said in lelling the prisoner what kind of a sen-
tence he must pronounce upon him. People in general, those who are
conversant with the Dictionary of Quotations, will perhaps on the
contrary, say Judex damnatur cum nocens absolvitur. But the ruffian was
not absolutely let off. For nearly the worst offence in the catalogue of
crimes, he was sentenced to about two-thirds of the doom of an em-
bezzling shopman, silly victim of vanity, racing-touts, and music-halls.
Under the new Act relative to the Property of Married Women, all
questions between husband and wife, touching property claimed by the
wife, can be decided either in the Court of Chancery, or by a County
Court Judge. In any event of this kind of Chancery suitorship, or
County Courtship after matrimony, if the property in dispute were
declared to be the wife's separate property, and thereafter her husband
were to take it away from her by force, would he commit robbery P
And if that force were applied with a bludgeon, or a pewter-pot, or a
pair of strong boots, would the robbery effected by it be robbery
attended with violenceP Then would it be punishable with penaj
servitude and flogging P Query.
CYNICAL REMINISCENCES.
Season Eoidently Over.
The old saying; that we English enjoy our pleasures sadly, may be
held by some philosophers to be fraught with special truth as regards
what are called the pleasures of society. For instance, just consider
the dulness of our dinner-parties. Think how vacuously stupid are the
vapid commonplaces which there are suffered to usurp the name of con-
versation. Look at the solemn faces that surround the social board,
and consider the bad viands and worse wine wherewith that board is
loaded to ruin the digestion. Then go to our ball-rooms, and see a
hundred dancers sweltering and struggling iu since scarcely for a
score. Observe the anxious looks of waltzers in piloting their partners
through the jostling throng. Look at the scrambling supper, and the
torn and draggling dresses, and the pale and pasty cheeks. Or get
invited to a soiree, musical or otherwise, and note what overwhelming
dulness there prevails. As for morning calls and lawn-parties, and the
like inane inflictions, one finds that adjectives are wanting properly to
picture the tortures there endured. It has been remarked that some
notion may be formed of the miseries of life by witnessing its pleasures;
and if we would gauge the depth of wretchedness inflicted by a dinner-
party, or other social gathering, we need but contemplate the features
of the social bored.
Charge and Payment.
"Charge!" is the Warrior's battle-cry
To his troops, drawn sword in hand.
Ay, charge indeed, a charge how high
Will his country have to stand!
Unless, as is our English way,
It be laid on chosen backs.
And they alone War's charges pay
Who are charged with an Income-Tax.
Literary Novelties.
Certain "Sqngs before Sunrise" are promised us, ere long, from
the pen of a young poet. We sincerely hope that no one, in America
or elsewhere, will be tempted to announce, also, "Ditties before
Dawn," or, some " Melodies for Moonlight." We see announced, too,
a new book, entitled, "Bits about Babies." We trust these bits may
be tit-bits; but we should sincerely regret to see them followed by
some " Chats about Chits," or, some " Scraps about Small People."
ON THE WING.
In consequence of the announcement, of the intended removal of the
Collections to South Kensington, much excitement prevails in the
Natural History Department of the British Museum, particularly
amongst the CoLE-qplerr.
A Neutral Question.
Could not our valiant but vain neighbours be brought to agree to a
modus vivendi with the Germans on reasonable termsP It is odd that
they prefer a modus moriendi on unequal terms. As the poor Irish-
women at a "wake" cry in deaf ears, we'may also demand of the
fallen French warriors :—" Why did ye die P"

PATERFAMILIAS ON THE WAB.
Mt brain's in a maze. and my mind's in a muddle,
With this War, and these rumours of War:
I'd no notion one'» head upon news one could fuddle,
And worse than on brandy by far!
I'm a peaceful John Bull, of manoeuvres and armies
Know as little as most Volunteers,
And I can't for the life of me think.what the chaim it
In reading of folks by the ears.
Tet I buy thrice the number of papers I used to,
F rom the newsboy, and newsman, and stall,
A cipher in business 1 'm being reduced to,
All pleasures, but telegrams, pall.
I invest in the war-maps, French, English, and German,
Stick pins in 'em—red, white, and blue;
Till in church the War comes betwixt me and the sermon,
And disturbs the repose of my pew.
At breakfast my wife finds my nose in the paper.
Till the tea and the muffins are cold:
My train to the City still sees me a gaper
At each place where papers are sold!
In the railway our talk is of Steinmetz, Mac Mahon,
The Crown Prince, Prince Carl, and Bazaine;
And when from the Station the 'bus you make way on,
'lis the same thing, all over again!
In the track of " Our Own Correspondent" a rover,
I peruse the campaign o'er and o'er:
Mot a scrap of their news but I bolt ten times over,
And, like Oliver Taut, ask for more I
My poor head seems to go round and round, like a squirrel
In a war-wheel caged, cribbed, and confined,
Till of war-monomania I might feel in peril,
Were not all in the same state of mind.
The Continent 'a closed, save to War Correspondents,
So my holiday, this year's, at home;
But in vain o'er our isle, with my brother-despondents,
In search of distraction I roam.
I seek the sea-side for a sniff of the briny,
But 'tis War-news, War-telegrams there!
While after the grouse, on the moor-land sun-shiny,
One thinks of the shooting elsewhere!
I'm aware all the while that this glut of War reading
Is wearing my mind like Bath brick:
What with telegram telegram hotly succeeding,
And letter on letter piled thick.
In fact, we 're all growing mere sieves for loose writing—
For news craving still, though news-cloyed:
And 'mong other pernicious effects of this fighting,
Our mental digestion's destroyed!
Dundreary's Last.

the French Chambers, whether Schneider isn't a "converted

WAR NOTES.
That is, the only kind of Notes for which Mr. Punch can
find Space during the present Crisis. The Charge to his
Correspondents is Five Guinras per line.
rar Mr. Punch,—The one
place on the Victoria Em-
bankment where there is
any shade, in the after-
noon, is behind Somerset
House. This fact will be
known through the Ages,
but I am the tirst to point
it out. Persons making
appointments with in-
tended wives will be thank-
ful to Yours truly,
Amoroso Sunrurnico.
Drar Punch,—Has any
quarrel arisen between St.
Clement and St. MaryP
I ask because the weather-
cocks of their respective
churches in the Strand
have an inconvenient habit
of pointing to different
quarters. jjver yours,
The Pig that Sees
the Wind.
[Oil on the troubled
weathercocks might be a
solution, only that oil isn't
one.]
Punch,
Our country friends are up again in town. I would not mind
it, but that 1 am compelled by the war to be in town also. Will you
tell them not to walk on both sides of the street at once, not to stand
staring because a cab-horse has fallen down, and, above all, not to help
the betting cads to block the way at the offices of the sporting papers.
Your obedient Servant,
Antirumpktn.
Revered Punch,
I rrad in the Saturday that an American etiquette book cau-
tions ladies not to use a comb in the drawing-room, when they come in
from a walk. Reminds me of a song of my youth:
"I've been roaming, I've been roaming
O'er the rose and lily fair,
And I'm combing, and I' m combing
All their blossoms from my hair."
Yours affectionately,
Mermaid.
Dear Mr. Punch,
Another controversy on the ever-vexed question of the deri-
vation of the word Parliament! As if you had not given final
judgment years ago. Parler, to speak, mentir, to lie.
Yours indignantly,
An EX-M.P.
Mt Drar Punch,
1 dare say that you are often asked toaccept "a fact," which
is no fact at all. But this is really one. A friend of mine, a gentle-
man, and one whom I never before convicted of any base or idiotic
action, actually dared to ask me yesterday why Berlin was the most
dissipated capital in Europe P Of course his friends have removed
the poor fellow to a place where he may be gradually cured—it is on
the left hand of the Brighton railway. Yours always
Bonassus Boorthater.
[Up to the present writing we have had 1162 of such cases, and
others are occurring while these lines pass through the press. We
may mention, also, that 973 idiots have asked us what the War will
cost France, and of course have answered their own foolish question
with the name of the Emperor.]
Mt Own Punch,
I am told by great letters in front of a house in the City,
"All these windows are Ancient Lights." Will you allow me space to
reply, civilly, that 1 don't care if they are.
Yours, faithfully,
One who Hates Unasked Information.
Drar Trrasury of Knowledge,
Will you kindly let me know where this quotation is to be
found P I have consulted every authority in vain.
"Off, Man's first Disobedience! Hand the fruit!"
Yours sincerely,
Llandidnotknow.
[We have not the least ider. Perhaps
can inform us. No other need apply.]
well-read Correspondent
Drar Punch,
1 am surprised that none of your amateur witcrackers have
sent you, wha1. hundreds of them must think a joke about " Worth."
The place is as ruinous to the Frenchmen as the man-milliner to their
wives. ComprennyP Yours truly,
A Bill-Pater.
BOYS WON'T BE BOYS.
There is an old saying that " boys will be boys," but in the present
day the negative of this assertion is much nearer to the truth. Boys
now won't be boys, at least as far as nature will allow them to deny it.
That is, they now eschew all so-thought boyish tastes and privileges,
and do their best,—or worst—t o be treated as young men. A boy when
he is twelve now aors the airs and manners of a youth of twenty. He
aspires to playing billiards instead of bagatelle, and in lieu of sucking
lollipops he must have his smoke." He can't enjoy a game of cricket
if he be not "in good form;" and as for being pleased with such a
weapon as a pop-sun. not even in his babyhood would such a childish
toy be sufficient for his aim. Boys rarely now play marbles or such
infantile games, but from their cradle jump to leap-frog, and then only
condescend to unbend themselves at foothall and other manly sports.
These they play with an exceeding air of gravity and judgment, and
engage in them apparently far less as an amusement than a business of
importance, which requires the deepest thought. If you take them to
a pantomime, boys will hardly condescend to smile at the hot poker,
and very likely will begin to criticise the ballet-girls and find fault with
the Columbine for wearing too much paint. Boys now bet upon the
boat-race and indulge in Derby Sweeps, and hardly condescend to
pocket less than guinea tips. Moreover, and perhaps this is the worst
symptom, too many boys are growing such precocious little gourmands,
as to have no healthy relish for Bath buns and "open jams," and
firmly to refuse to patronise a pastrycook who is unable to supply them
with dry ginger-beer.
THE TOURISTS AND THE THAMES.
Isle of Eel-pies, exists yet thine hotel
For holiday excursions from CockaigneP
Prepare thy board then, to regale the Swell—
The Rhine is closed by war, which doth compel
At home our tourists mostly to remain.
And up the Thames this year may Gentles fare.
(On Gentles pun let angler if he please.)
Then, Bel-pie Island, 'twill with thee be well.
Some will seek Teddington for fresher air.
Or Hampton Court, to breathe a purer breeze.
Thames Dii.ton some will visit yet again,
Maidenhead, Taplow, Cliefden capped with trees.
At Marlow in their inn they '11 take their ease;
And may the Pilgrim see things well done there.
Questionable.
In one of Edmond Arout's letters to the Soir, he says :—
"But Providence or chance put me to bed on Sunday night in the same
chamber where Marshal MacMahon slept the evening before, ami Genrral
Baron Gerpdorp two days after. I found in it a packet of telegraphio des-
patches, forgotten by the Marshal. These papers did not belong to me, so I
gave them up. They belonged to history. I took a copy of them."
Quite right to give these papers up, M. Arout, but quite wrong, as we
think, to copy them. Who can now be surprised at Ministers of War
and Commanders-in-Chief not receiving Newspaper Correspondents
with open arms f
Educational Chess.
A Contemporary, urging on Churchmen the policy of setting to
work immediately at the loundation of schools to be conducted on
Church principles, observes that:—" The great difficulty is, that the
Bishops cannot be got to! move." WhyP Is it because they cannot
without getting in check?

(Concluded.)
"What a beautiful tight is a perambulator filled with healthy
children! To me this little machine is one of the most useful inventions
of modern civilisation, and only third to the steam-engine and the patent
feeding-bottle."—Malthus.
"Give me the ballot-box, and I will undertake to change the whole
aspect of affairs in this property-ridden nation—to substitute satisfac-
tion for discontent, prosperity for poverty, and a manly independence
of character in lieu of that degrading servility to the higher ranks
which now prevails to an intolerable extent."—Lord Eldon.
"Economy in small things is especially to be deprecated. Extra-
vagance is not waste; and a lavish expenditure, even though it may
not be supported by a commensurate income, affords gratification and
weekly wages to numbers, and is injurious to no one, except, perhaps,
to the man himself, and he ought to have read my works and known
better."—Adam Smith.
"Your beardless brainless ensign, your white-handed white-banded
stripling hot from College, your twenty-one year old senator—these be
the men to have power and rule, and to exercise authority over the
bodies and souls and substance of all those inferior creatures, to whom
fortune has denied the advantages of birth, and social position, and
carriage-horses, and admission to the ranks of the County Magistracy."
—Corrett.
"Let girls have their own way early. Encourage them to spend
much of their time, money, and thoughts, in dress and personal adorn-
ment; to use every artifice to attract the attention of the other sex;
and to slight the dull, monotonous, routine of home pleasures and
duties for the excitements of Society, the caprice* of
accomplishment of the supreme aim of woman'* ~

"Of all forms of Government a democracy is the most objectionable.
Nothing can equal a Monarchy, with its standing army, hereditary
peerage, and gold and silver sticks in waiting."—Oliver Cromwell.
"Liberty! I know nothing more 'pernicious. The (licence of a
free press would be insupportable, the mischief of free 'speech incal-
culable. I would a thousand times rather that printing ink had never
been invented, than that it should be abused to disseminate, amongst
the humbler sorts of men, those notions of equality, and that spirit of
insubordination to constituted authority, which are the dangerous
symptoms of this levelling age."—Benjamin Franklin,
"To have nothing to do, to do it inefficiently, and to be well paid
for your trouble, that is my idea of a comfortable condition of life."—
Jeremy Be nth am.
"Happiness does not consist in trifles. It is not to be found in
home enjoyments, in the society of an amiablejand intelligent partner,
or in the run of a well-stocked fruit-garden on a soft afternoon in the
month of August. Happiness is an affair of pomp, and state, and
etiquette, and hot theatres, and large dinner-parties, and a full suit .of
black clothes on a sultry evening in July."—Cowper.
"The Analysis of Ideas has still to be written, and the mill is not yet
erected which will produce the paper that shall record the results.
Whence they come, where they stay, whither they go, and what is
their mutual interdependence—these are all inscrutable problems to
baffle the wisest philosopher, and dismay the most arrogant thinker.
Are they innate eidola or merely intellectual secretions f Are they

growth of psychological organisms into the maturity of ripened thought
and masterly action f
"If the mind of man were a tabula ramt, ready to receive the newest
impressions and ths latest fashions, working by its own activity and
relying on no extraneous agency for its supply of motive force, we
could believe, with Smigletius and 'the solitary monk that shook
the world,' in an endless succession of elastic causations, and so solve
the problem of thought in one facile moment; but, as it is, we are left
to grope on in the dim vaults of dusty speculation, with no light but
the flickering taper of metaphysics, wit,li no guide but the impulse
of a wayward fancy, and with no goal beyond but the gloomy mo-
rass of human ignorance and perplexity, in which so many have lost
their weary way, and disappeared for ever in the vain attempt to sound
the unfathomable abyss of idea and actuality."—Bishop Berkeley.
With this Thought, contributed by him to whom Pope gave—
"Every Virtue under Heaven,"
Mr. Punch's Collection is complete. He has conducted Thoughts to
the "Abyss," and now they may "angle for impossibilities."
BRUCE AND BRUCE.
Scotland boasts of one Bruce. Sbe has another Bruce, of whom,
if he follows Mr, Punch's guidance, she may boast hereafter.
The prior Bruce devoted his beat attention to the national
defences of his country. The posterior Bruce, in reply to a letter
addressed to him by the Chairman of the Mersey Docks and
Harbour Board, anxiously pressing npon the Government the expe-
diency of taking measures for the immediate defence of the port of
Liverpool, promises " that should this country be unexpectedly involved
in war, the Dock Board may rest assured that due measures will be
taken for the protection of Liverpool from internal dangers or external
attack." Surely these words must have been misread by the gentleman
above referred to, in communicating them to a meeting over which be
presided. R Bruce, truly, was one Bruce, and H. A. Bruce is
another; but the Member for Renfrewshire cannot so entirely differ
from the Scottish King but that the foregoing quotation of his lan-
guage, if correctly rendered, would read as follows :—" that lest this
country should be unexpectedly involved in war, due measures will,
the Dock Board may rest assured, be immediately taken for the.pro-
tection of Liverpool," &c. Perhaps, indeed, the Secretary op State
por the Home Department applied a stronger epithet than that of
"due" to the defensive measures which he spoke about. "Measures
long overdue " may have been the phrase really employed, with an eye
to accuracy, by the Right Honourable Gentleman.
THE KNELL OF TEMPLE BAR.
Poos old Temple Bar is doomed at last, and truly they who lament
its doom are in a small and mouldy minority. Yet may Mr. Punch be
allowed to say a word in imaginary arrest of judgment on this struc-
ture, of which the City of London once boasted as one of its principal
wonders. The fact, first proclaimed by Mr. Bright, that you cannot
drive six omnibuses abreast through Temple Bar, is daily illustrated by
the retardation of vehicles owing to the attempt to drive as many as
possible. Of course this prohibits the possibility of crossing Fleet
Street for some distance to the East of its junction with the Strand.
But you have only to walk a few paces to the West, and cross the
Strand, which will do just as well, and can be done easily. The Eastern
contraction of Fleet Street impeding the traffic, lets carriages pass
into the Western expanse of the Strand only one or two at a time;
hence the latter space is always comparatively clear. When Temple
Bar is destroyed, the Civic Corporation will, to speak in anatomical
language, lose its Pylorus.
Mrs. Ramsbotham.
Mas. Ramsrotham says she hears that the' Ruffianly Brigands of
Greece "are all bandied together. Horrible!" She writes to her
daughter, "think of Brigands with bow legs! I don't wonder at their
committing every specious of deformity." Sbe adds, with respect to
her country cottage which she has recently taken, that "all the vege-
table Marys have been snivelled up by the sun. We've no peas, and
the gardener has had to cut his sticks."
"Now let's Dance, About, About."
Punch was much comforted at reading on the placards Edmond
Arout Sape. But he was still more delighted on finding next day
that Edmond was quite safe, and enlivening Le Soir with his vivid
sketches. Edmond s health!
NATIONALIST NEUTRALITY.
Success to the French in their fight with the Teuton;
For the base Saxon's own cousin-german is he.
Martin Luther, the blackguard, and Bacon, and Newton,
Them three heretics all is the limbs of one tree.
And the Sceptre of England by mar'ge is united
To the Crown that, confines a proud Protestant's brow.
May the faithful be blest and the foeman be blighted,
Though the former is getting the worst of it now!
Napoleon the Third, in our bosoms we nourish
The hope of invasion, for Oirland designed,
When sprigs of shillelagh shall round thy head flourish;
And the sword with the shamrock so green shall be twined.
So. having destroyed the insidious formation
Of one big German people against thy command,
O come and help us to our unification,
With an Oirish Republic for our native land.
Thy troops shall yet triumph in spite of small blunders,
Sure they carry the checsepots, and how should they fail,
As they did at Montana, once more to work wonders r
Ocb, thine Eagle, Napoleon.'s the bird to prevail!
St. Patrick confounded the frogs with his sermon,
Now with haythenish reptiles as well may'st thou cope,
And into the rivers and ponds drive each German,
Nay, don't interpose, holy, iligant Pope!
INSULARITY REBUKED.
With all reverence for the memory of our forefathers, we must
admit, reviewing their estimate of foreign nations in general, and parti-
cularly their Continental neighbours, that they were extremely narrow
and illiberal. Owing to want of those facilities for international com-

feeling; they were insular: and they failed to form a just appreciation
of the probity, if not the intelligence, of European foreigners, especially
the French and Germans. Had the words of the National Anthem
been reserved to be written in the present day, that poem could never
have included the two following verses, levelled at Sovereigns and their

BETTER CONVICT THAN JURYMAN.
The New Act on Juries, according to the Times, contains an odd
provision. "Convicts, except outlaws, are disqualified." This excep-
tion would puzzle (Edipus. That the circumstance of being an outlaw
in addition to being a convict should redeem the disqualification
attached to a convict's character, is a mystery which no fellow, not
even he who unriddled the Sphinx, can be expected to understand.
This enactment also provides that "Jurors may be allowed a fire when
out of court, and be allowed to receive reasonable refreshment, such
refreshment to be procured at their own expense." Really P What a
mercy! They are still left, subject to the useless annoyance of being
locked up together all night, tempered only with permission to buy
warmth and food out of their own pockets. The brutality with which
jurors have been wont to be treated is to be mitigated a little; but
what absolute necessity is there why they should be subjected to brutal
treatment at ail P Is it desirable that the oath whereby they are
adjured to do their duty should be accompanied with mental impreca-
tions on their country and their country's legislature, by whom that
duty is imposed upon them, and rendered penal P Convicts are to be
disqualified from serving as jurymen, are they P This exemption is
enough to make a man wish that he had been a convict, in order that
he might be exonerated from the disgusting obligation of being a juror, j

Mr. Foncii finds the following pletling advertisement in the Church
Times:— ''"• •
HOME WANTED, for an unmanageable boy, aged 10, with a
clergyman. Strict disciplinarian, accustomed and willing to birch.
Liberal terms; sings in choir. ...
If this were inserted merely with a view of terrifying that evil boy—
why—let it pass. The suggestion that he is to be made to sing out
elsewhere than in the choir is amiable. That he can sing there, and
yet is naughty, shows that church music, at all events, hath not charms
to soothe the savage breast. . Bat we hope the Flogging Parson who is
wanted is an imaginary being. The sternest Head-Master is not
"willing" to inflict castigation. On the wbole, Mr. Punch suspects a
"sell," but what irreverent creature could put a sell into the Church
Times? Perhaps, as Dr. Johnson said: "The dog's a Dissenter, Sir."
THE DUTIE8 OF NEUTRALS.
Never to neglect an opportunity of interfering between husband
and wife. , ,
Never, on any account, to allow lovers to settle their own quarrels.
To be prompt in volunteering advice, especially disagreeable advice.
Always to be ready to give an opinion as to a lady's age.
To make a point of differing from Mamma, in every particular, when
she praises baby.
When Major Thunderclap declares that the Army was never in a
worse condition than it is now, and Mr. Rosrhew insists that it is in
the highest possible state of efficiency, to disagree with both disputants.
To plunge into all street-rows.
Needlessly to take part in squabbles between relations.
Generally, to meddle in other people's business, and to neglect their
own.
• EVERYTHING BY TURN.
"The Woman's Suffrage Association of the State of New York met at
Saratoga [very appropriate place] on the 2Sth of July. The Erv. Oltmpia
Brown, in addressing the meeting, insisted that woman can do all the duties
imposed by citizenship, even to going into the field in time of war. She
stated that in the rebellion several women entered the ranks, and gave their
lives in battle." i • ,
This about completes the picture of the Moder n Woman. She only
wanted to be an Amazon to make her perfect. Merely to be a Vtvan-
diere no longer satisfies her desires; merely to tend the sick and the
wounded seems bat a poor outlet for her masculine energies. She feels
(at least, according to the Rev. Oltmpia Brown) that she must do
far more than this—that she must throw down the scissors and the
darning-needle for the sword and the needle-gun; don a becoming
uniform, follow the dram, serve as an artillery woman, enter the sister
service, and generally share in all the horrors and sufferings, rewards
and honours, of battle and bloodshed.

don't know any of our neighbours except the clergyman, who is lately married,
and is very usurious, which, you know, means fond of bis wife. That's a vice on the
right side now-a-days. There was an escape of gas here yesterday, and the man who
did the pipes caught it, I can tell you. I let him know what a blowing-up was.
'J he other day we went to see an ancient cburch and a nunnery. That is, the
remains of one. The ruins were perfect. The guide pointed out to us where the
refractory was, where the nuns were fed. In the church they showed us a curious
amboney (they call it, I think, it's Greek), which is a sort of pulpit where two people
preached at once.
"I thought till now that Ambony was the name of a great Italian singer; but I
suppose I'm wrong, because she couldn't be the same person.
Then there was the Ccedilier (or some such word), meaning three seats for the

A PANACEA FOR THE WOUNDED.
Where is Dr. Newton, the Healing Medium from America P (U.S.) He should be
at the seat of war if he is what he professes himself. A pretty kind of healing medium
he must be, if he cannot even heal wounds. All accounts of Dr. Newton, given us
by the organs of Spiritualism, represent him as possessed of a healing power conjoined
with a benevolence, which, in their combination, constitute him a Poor Man's Friend,
worth any quantity of given, not to name bought, gallipots of the ointment so called.
If Dr. Newton is half the healer and philanthropist those who believe in him make
him out, he would instantly rush to the battle-plain, and stop the effusion of blood.
BLEEDING, BUT NOT BEATEN.
Ill-fated France, that bleedest sore,
From every vein, at every pore!
O'er Belgium's frontier streaming, see
The life-blood of thy industry.
The patient brains and dextrous hands
Of Germany's laborious bands,
Whom in blind rage and bitter hate,
Thou spurnest from thy leaguered gate,—
Blood, whose out-pouring wastes thy veins
Of labouring strength, and labour's gains.
And elsewhere o'er thy frontier, lo
Thine own sons in their thousands flow,
Bearing from warfare's scourge and spoil
The blood that should enrich thy soil!
And while thy industry, thy land,
Lose life-blood thus, on either hand,
See other fountains, nobler still,
The streams thou gavest, freely spill!
Thy soldiers' blood, mixed with their foe's,
Like water, on thy bosom, flows,
And flows to waste—not to renew
The Laurels, to such watering due!
O noble mother of brave sons,
'Twixt thee and me an ocean runs—
An ocean whose dissev'ring tide
Doth not more than old hates divide.
But spite of old hates, and old wars,
And wounds still rankling 'neath their scars,
My heart bleeds for thee and thy pains—
Bleeds even with thy bleeding veins
Of industry and wealth, and, worst,
Of courage, with ill-guidance curst!
But bleeding, fainting, falling, still
Holds the indomitable will,
And seems to harden under blows.
And strengthens with thy strengthening foes,
Till thou hast never seemed so great
As now, in this thy worst estate!
Let me not ask, in this sad hour,
What dark designs, what lust of power,
What selfish hope to save a crown,
Or to a son to hand one down,
Spoke the irrevocable word
That bade thee draw thy ready sword,
Hood-winked, misled, with bosom bared,
Ill-gener&IIed, and unprepared;
Nor seek to weigh, with balance fine,
The weight of others' wrong and thine.
Whate'er thou strovest for first, I see
Thou strivest, now, for thy right to be:
Strivest to guard thy hearths and homes,
Thine altars and ancestral tombs.
For all, for which thy foes had striven,
Had thine ill-lot to them been given.
And till thou sweep those foes away,
Wisely postponest the reckoning-day,
With him whose dark and desperate game
Hath brought thee to this pass of shame!
To them that so strive, in their need
England, perforce, must wish God speed!
Enough of brave blood has been shed
To atone ill-will to strife misled;
Enough of thy blood, and the foe's,
That, worthy thine, as freely flows:
God guide their hearts such Peace to frame,
As thou mayst sign, and feel no shame.
May kindly Nature work to hide
The prints of the invaders' stride,
And springs of inborn strength restore
The lavish waste of generous gore,
Till, as the seasons roll along,
And Man's will and Heaven's grace are strong.
Good even of war the World shall win,

ourselves:—
Me. Daddie Longlrgs and his friend, Mr, Stumper, have started
for a walk from London to the Land's End, returning [via John o'

Straw's Castle, Hampstead, where they had been resting for upwards
of a fortnight, and strengthening their muscles daily with the manly

at the moderate expense of half-a-crown an hour.
Propessor Muddlewits has been enjoying a week's 'fishing in

treasures of the deep which he has managed to collect.
Mrs. Stalker and her daughters are out heir-hunting at Cowes, her
last season in London having yielded her bad sport.
Mr. Alpine Clurre has twice made the ascent of Primrose Hill,

Mr. Swotter has made one of a reading set this autumn. Their
daily hours for study are from twelve till two, with an interval of five
and thirty minutes for refreshment.
The Misses Symper, and their " Ma," are now enjoying a delightful
holiday at Margate. Their principal amusements are bobbing up and
down in a foot and a half of water for three-quarters of an hour,
and promenading on the pier with their back hair down to dry; also
devouring trashy novels at the rate of three a day, scampering to the

actively engaged in writing down the
abusing us English for our alleged sympathy with
SOPS FOR O'CERBERUS.
Mr. Punch,
These is one point
wherein the Liberal Go-
vernment, in the policy
which it is pursuing
towards Ireland, shows
itself unworthy of its
name. It most unwisely
neglects a 'class of
persons exercising the
strongest influence for
good and evil, but chiefly
for good, if chiefly for
their own good, over
warm-hearted and im-
pulsive Irishmen. Irish
opinion is formed, Irish
opinion is swayed, by
Irish journalists, I beg
their pardon, by the gen-
tlemen of the Irish Press.
These gentlemen are now
aggressive Germans, and
thy with them rather than
with the invaded French. Thus,"they not only^ intensify their country-
men's natural animosity against the proud Saxon, but also do their
utmost to embitter his French neighbours against him too, with a view
to bring down upon us the future vengeance of Louis Napoleon rein-
stated in absolute power. Their diatribes, omnipotent in their own
country, have little less influence in France, where they are almost
universally perused on account of the elegance, as well as the eloquence,
of which they are patterns in style. Now, what has Mr. Gladstone's
Administration done to conciliate these formidable adversaries P Nothing.
On the contrary, it has exasperated them by menaces which, from a
contempt, as insulting as injudicious^ for their splendid invectives, it
has failed to enforce.
Sir, it is time to tell a mistaken Ministry that they must not think to
terrify those undaunted patriots by shaking the rod of a Coercion Bill
over their heads. This is not the way to silence their bold out-speak-
ing. How can the Premier fail to discern that there is only one
course, and that not one out of three courses, to disarm their terrible
hostility! Let him lose no time in repairing the omission he has made
in his scheme for the pacification of Ireland, by amply subsidising
them all . This truly liberal policy would have the certain effect, not,
indeed, of stopping their fearless utterances, but what would be much
better, of reversing them, and turning sneers, sarcasms, vituperations,
and maledictions into the equally unmeasured language of compliment
and eulogy. Thus the editor and whole staff of such respectable, as
well as powerful papers, as the Irishman, the Flag of Ireland, and the
Nation, would, in what they may call a pig's whisper, be turned from
our outrageous vilifiers into hyperbolical eulogists, as long as ever they
continued to enjoy their subsidies. Of course, provided always that
the subsidy in each case exceeded the amount derivable by its recipient
from the sale of his newspaper. I hope, Mr. Punch, you will be pleased
to print the suggestion which I gratuitously offer to Statesmen, who,
however sagacious, do not know how to deal with Hoolan and
Doolan. And, ever let them remember, gIg jjat qdi cito jjAT-

contraband of war. Swaggered a bit: no use. The Prussians, who
are quite the gentlemen, will square us, so we 're hanging on here by
our eyelids. At least, I am. We've not been coining. My partner
said he was going to see his aunt at Brussels, and hasn't turned up
again. Been on the scoop, aunt and all, p'raps, ever since.
I thought I'd just make a penn'orth or two with the remaining
B. and S., about three dozen of each, out of the French army. Got

have stumped the Great Dook himself. "Where are we now P" says
I. And Your Own would have come to an untimely end if he hadn't

spring or false bottom, and mitrailleuses quite out of the betting. (By
the way, I hate a fool. Some Literary Dustman out here says to me,
says he, " You can't get on without a Pass." "' Which it are,' said
the Duchess," I replied, believing him, and then, says I, " What pass
shall I ask for P" He winks his wicked eye, and tells me, " The Pass
of the Vosges." Which was a sell for the Great King, you'1l observe,
as I didn't know that the Vosges were mountains, and thought it was
the name of some neutral cove in office, who was to give the order for
Cockalorums to roam about all over the shop. They nearly locked up
this gay Militaire for calling at the official bureau to ask for the Vosges
Pass. I inquired, also, tenderly after Vosges himself. If ever I catch

the subject. Compromise with spectacles, perhaps. I have bought a
Gee (bay, fifteen-four, aud jump anything; got him cheap 'cos of two

And strength of stern self-sacrifice, that bears her onward still;
la the brotherhood that from end to end doth through her empire ran,
In the love that steels her softest, and binds high and low in one;
In the strength sublime of a common heart, and the tie of a common
cause,
That links for defence of Fatherland, its homes, and fields, and laws!
And the World has her per contra in the protest 'gainst faith in gold,
The proof that men will give their lives for what cannot be bought and
sold.
Yes, heavy may be the account of loss that War's bloody book contains.
But not less, on the per contra side, write off these mighty gains!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.

AT THE EVENING PARTY (continued)—A PLUNGE—THE MAZURKA.
ecidedly not. A uniform is some-
thing to be respected, like the British
flag. (Boomp-je!) Let them find
out what I am. (Begin to wish I was
in bed.)
Gooch disappears. Bund is with
people I don't know. Maullie has
been introduced to some Dutch
artists, and everyone else is dancing,
talking, or walking.
1 fix myself by a door, and begin
to indulge in bitter thoughts of the
world at large. What an ass 1 was
(I think to myself) to be persuaded to
come in uniform. It's myi con-
founded good-nature. Dear me !—
two ladies from England, v. hom I've
met before.
Miss Howker, quite the belle of
the ball, and Miss Millar with her
mother.
Miss Howker quite surprised to
see me here. She is talking to a
French gentleman with a red riband
and an 'order in his button-hole; she goes 'on talking after she has
said she is so surprised. Can't enter into their conversation, as I don't
know what it's about. All I can do is to smile on them, patronisingly.
The distinguished foreigner is evidently puzzled; so is she. I
smile again; I don't know why, but rather as if to say, " Isn't this
funny, isn't this just like me t" That is if she views my uniform in
that light.
1 feel that many eyes are upon me, and eye-glasses too. The
opinion (I also feel this from little things I hear said in
quarters) is tiiat i am an " eeeeninc Unylushmun connected with the Post
Office" and that the uniform is common enough in London. One
French lady explains to a German that I am an alderman. Muntley,
who has been taking champagne, insists upon addressing me as My
Lord Mayor, and bowing obsequiously. I beg him not to play the
fool . He leaves me. I hope he won't go and spread it about that
I'm the Lord Mayor.
There is an undoubted Englishman in the corner with large whiskers
and moustache eyeing me indignantly. I return his look with indig-
nation. We shall have words, "before," as Gooch would say, "I can
wink my eye," if I don't take care.
I tell Miss Howker about the Contingent, which, I am bound to say,
she does not believe, and I add that I am going to Aldershot to join
the Rifles for drill. (Boomp-je!)
Gooch, coming up at this moment, says, "Do you all the good in
the world, old fellow; fine you down a bit."
I smile at Gooch pityingly, to give Miss Howker the idea that I
only tolerate him, and that fdon't want "fining down." The Mazurka
strikes up. Shall I (not knowing the Mazurka except by having
seen it) risk it with Miss Howker, and so cut out Gooch, or not P
If I do, it will probably terminate amicable relations for ever between
Miss Howker and myself. But still. . . . Boomp-je! . . . Yes. I
might boompje through it.*
Gooch says, when I have just got the words on the tip of my tongue.
"May I, Miss HowkerP" and Miss Howker consults her card, and
finding she has at least six names down for this one dance, settles the
difficulty by accepting Gooch.
I smile disdainfully as they leave me, laughing. At what are they
laughingf At whom P Muntley, passing me at this moment with a
French lady on his arm, bows, and says, "J'espere que nous eles
heurevx, mi lord Maire." I frown. I hate such tomfoolery. Will speak
to him alone, seriously.
There are some moments when, if I looked in the glass, I should
expect to see myself pale and haggard, with dark dank hair hanging
about anyhow. I do look into the glass and I see—but no matter.
"Time writes no wrinkle on thy something brow," as the poet says of
the sea: and as he did say it of the sea, he might as well have written
"winkle" instead of "wrinkle" a notion that I shall put forward in
my earliest collection of Boompje Poems.
I watch the Mazurkr. A great man has said, we can always learn
something from somebody. Which means, we can always learn any-
thing from anybody. Now here are a lot of anybodies and somebodies
teaching me, unconsciously, the Mazurkr.
It seems to me, observing this, that you must go a little back like a
wave on the shingle (Poetical Boompje) with a view to coming well
forward again like (also) a wave (same one) on the shingle. That you
then hop—or jump—and then slide. Watching the different couples, I
can't make out whether you hop first, or slide first. I feel an irre-
sistible desire to dance it. I feel at the same time a shyness which
whispers "Don't." I feel immediately afterwards a voice which says
"This is pride, false pride. Dance! Boompje, dance!" Think to
myself that I should like to try it alone in a side-room first. Of course -
to ask for this accommodation is out of the question.
I look around. Yes, there is Miss Millar near her mother. She is
not dancing. "Come desperation lend thy furious hold." Faint heart
never danced fair Mazurkr.
Froggey would a-dancing go, whether Miss Millar's mother
wouldn't or no.
All these quotations, adapted, oddly enough flit through my mind as
I come up and say, "May I have the, &c. &c.," mumble, mumble.
She declines. I rush on my fate and exert pressure. She declines
again, feebly. I become impassioned, nay, determined, as the chance
of dancing becomes fainter and fainter. She accepts. [N.B. I must
possess a wonderful dramatic power, facially, as it was my last look at
her made her change her mind, and accept me. Must now use more
facial expression, and look supremely happy.] She astonishes me by
informing me that she can't dance the Mazurka very well, and hopes
1 won't be very angry with her.
I reply, encouragingly, that "she will soon pick it vp." I add that
it isn't very difficult; and I sincerely hope it isnt.
We commence picking it up together. My sword joins the dance.
I beg pardon. Must hook it up. Do so. Commence again. Sword
too heavy. The start, is a difficulty. Two steps totally unconnected
with any known dance whatever, ana a bump irom a couple coming
round. Apology from me. Stare from them. Two steps more.
Another bump from somebody turning, apparently, the wrong way.
Slight apology from me. Anathema 1 fancy from them. A couple
starts behind us; their starting puts my starting oat. 1 frown on them,
and observe to my partner, that it is astonishing people can't keep out
of the way in a ball-room. She says, "Yes, some people are so
stupid." I agree with her. 1 propose going to another part of the
room and commencing again. We go there. It is certainly clearer
until we commence our steps, when everybody seems suddenly to arrive
on the spot. I determine to start and go the whole Boompje, or perish
in the attempt. We take two steps with what feet I don't know. I
feel a sort of galvanic tremor, from my boots upwards. Then one
foot will stick down, while the other comes up out of time. We
do something which is intended for a hop, and turns'out a jump. We
struggle together, with clasped hands, somehow, as if we were trying the
strength of our wrists, and we manage to turn round in a sort of un-
easy jig, like ecstatic organ figures, and then I come down with a
decided stamp on somebody's train.
A sharp crisp sounding tear. I apologise with' one leg in the air,
having lil ted it to do the hop. Apology scarcely acknowledged. I hear
mumbled words like "gauche, "stupid," "doesn't know how to
dance," and so forth.
Miss Millar thinks we'd better stop. I think so too, but I won't.
(Boomp-je!) No. we '11 have another turn round. We try': and come
sharply backwards on Gooch and his partner. They are laughing.
At me. I know it. Should have done this turn well but for that. As
it is I finish my next attempt at a hop and a slide by kicking Miss
Millar. We stop. I beg a hundred thousand pardons, a million.
Good gracious. I didn't mean—heavens
"It doesn't matter—it was an accident." she replies, and asks to be
taken to her Mammr. I protest against this. While I am protesting
we are bumped three times in different directions, and are finally
cannoned into the crowd, where we do more struggling and tumbling,
being finally landed near a sort of mantel-piece, on which we both lean,
exhausted.
I apologise again for kicking her. Quite an accident, I say; of
course, she didn't suppose I only took her out to kick her. "Won't
she have any refreshment."
No, she '11 go to her mother, please.
I feel what she '11 say to her mother of me.
I take her back. She bows distantly, and I know that henceforth
mountains separate me from Miss Millar.
I retire gradually, and join a convivial party (Maullie among the
number) in the supper-room.
"Dancing, old boy P" asks Maullie.
"No," I reply, carelessly; "at least only just one turn. Too
crowded."
We sup, and return to the hotel, where we discuss our next move.
"Sweet Rememrjrancer."

that the ouly Campaign you are allowed to share is Elecampane—and

IDEAL INTELLIGENCE.
In the present dearth of all news hut war-news, the subjoined par-
ticulars of diversified intelligence may not be without interest corre-
sponding; to that which Romance would possess if substituted, under
the stress of circumstances, for History.
A Lite Antediluvian.—Some workmen on Monday last, engaged
in the excavations going on at Great Gulston in the oolite, disinterred
a Pterodactyl** longirostris, in a state of suspended animation. This
hitherto supposed to be extinct saurian measured six feet in length.
On being placed in the sun it revived in a few minutes, and expanded
its wings, of which the extent from tip. to tip must have been it least
ten feet, and immediately flew away over the ocean, whither nobody
knows.
Origin of Species.—A sow in the possession of Mr. Mangold,
farmer, of Snorton Suis, produced, on the 24th inst., a farrow of nine
piglings, one of which has a snout terminating in a proboscis similar to
that of the elephant, only of smaller size. This aberrant little pachy-
derm presents an illustration of the Theory of Development which may
be acceptable to Mr. Darwin.
A Narrow Escape.—The earth in the garden of Mr. Fiers, of
Fudgely, suddenly, on the afternoon of Wednesday last, opened and
swallowed a summer-house. Only an instant before Mr. F. and a
party of friends had vacated the spot, where they had, been smoking
cigars and imbibing brandy-and-water; so that their escape may be
regarded as remarkable, if not miraculous.
A Credit to its Species.—Propessor Podger has a goose which,
having reared it from the shell, he has succeeded in teaching to talk
better than any parrot. The Professor has refused the offer of enor-
mous sums, by persons desirous of purchasing this uncommon bird for
purposes of exhibition.
An Unusual Meteor was witnessed by a correspondent of the
Walkerstown Observer, lie aays that it presented the appearance of
illuminated letters, which traversed the tky from the Pleiades in the
direction of the Great Bear, and ultimately formed themselves into .lie
word Ozokerit.
A Black Rain.—The sequestered village of Qaagbrook was yester-
day visited by a shower of leeches, many of whicu attached themselves
to the horses and cattle in the neighbourhood, exerting their powers of
sanguisuction, it is feared, not without some injury to the poor animals.
Novel Efpect of Lightning.—Bishop's Hokey, this morning,
suffered a severe storm of thunder and lightning. The electric fluid
struck the house of our talented townsman, Mr. Sfakkes, surveyor
and auctioneer, and, passing down the chimney on to the meat-jack,
glanced off to the dresser, peeling, in .its course, a number of pota-
toes, which the cook had just removed from the saucepan. Coo key,
though she experienced some little alarm, was gratified on discovering
that the levin brand had saved her trouble.
A Very Rare Visitor.—The Hon. Felix Popper, of Cramstead,
a few days since, shooting wildfowl, brought down, among a flock of
puffins, what he took to be some strange bird, but which proved to be
a flying-fish. It has been deposited in the County Museum.

ANIMAL WATERS.
There is something well worth seeing and tasting in America just
now. Tourists, warred out from Baden and Homburg, may be glad to
know that—
"A hot spring has been discovered in Nevada, from which flows, if not
chicken soup, something so like it, when properly seasoned with pepper and
salt, as to make it impossible to tell one from the other. Three pounds of
beef boiled in the water of this spring will yield as much broth as twelve pounds
boiled in ordinary water. Nor is its usefulness confined to this, for it has
been discovered to possess a property, not found, we believe, in other chicken
soup, of perpetuating itself, so to speak, by hatching out the eggs of its chief
constituent."
How delightful is all this! an ever-flowing, natural tureen of
chicken broth! Patients only required to bring iheir own pepper
and salt. Nutritious beef-tea and fresh-boiled eggs on the premises.
We are not told who had the distinction of first discovering these
invaluable culinary waters, but he must have been a broth of a boy.
Around them we can picture a handsome city already springing up, to
be known far and wide as Chickenbad. Soon, too, there will be seen
in our own shop-windows an announcement of Bottled Chicken Soup,
newly imported from Americr.
A friend, whose weak point is certainly not credulity, observes that
he has a suspicion, just a soupcon, that the whole thing may turn out
a hoax., and that, fond as he is of adventure and novelty, he does not
intend to go out to Nevada on such a chicken-hazardous expedition.
THE STANDARD OP NEUTRALITY.
Holding, as we do, that it is not the business of newspaper folks to
attack each other, but rather to unite for the general confusion of
mankind, we seldom refer to a contemporary, except in the way of
graceful recognition of his merit. In that spirit Punch begs cordially
to compliment the Standard, not only in professing the most complete
neutrality of sentiment on the subject of the present war, but on prac-
tising such neutrality in the most fearless manner. That such practice
seems to involve self-stultification is a trifle compared to the assertion
of a noble principle. For instance, on Saturday morning the Standard
had two beautifully written leading articles on the peril of Paris. They
came close together, and at the end of the first it was exquisitely
said:—
"If Paris is only as true to its duty as the army, there should be little
fear but that this evil hour may be safely passed; rut on Pauis hangs (»«•)
THE DESTINIES OF FRANCE."
Then came the other leading article, and about fifteen lines after the
above declaration we read:—
"To-day Paris would ry no mrans drag after it the rest op
France. and the situation of affairs in 1870 resembles far more that of 1792
than of 1814 and 1815."
Now this we call true neutrality, and though it may puzzle the
country parsons, it is delightful to those who like to see the British
Press taking its proper position.
THE ROMAN PEAR.
Good Catholics may be of opinion that the Pope has handselled his
Infallibility by offering to mediate between King William and Louis
Napoleon. That may be doubted by others, who, nevertheless, con-
sider that in so doing his Holiness has done a good action and no
mistake. The Daily Telegraph lately remarked in an article on the
Roman question:—
"The pear is almost ripe, and its fall cannot be delayed many years."
By "the pear" our contemporary means the Temporal Papacy. But
the present Incumbent of the Popedom may be called a pear too.
By his endeavour to pnt a stop to the war now raging in civilised
Europe, the Holy Father has clearly proved himself a "Bon Chretien."

expressed her surprise to her bosom friend, Mrs. Ramsroiham, that
the new Jewish Synagogue was not open for service!
FAREWELL TO THE RAMROD.
(Sung by a Volunteer).
Ramrod, wherewith I still
Do exercise at drill,
'Tis time that we did part,
For obsolete thou art—
Fare thee well!
Because Britannia's sons!
Require breechloading guns,
In case a foreign band
Invade their native land.
Fare thee well!
Go, Ramrod, go thy way,
For thou hast had thy day.
Go, after gun-flints, go,
Like matchlock, arrow, and bow—
Fare .thee well.!
No more the raw recruit,
Thee, at review, shall shoot
Off, by mischance, among
The British Public's t hrong—
Fare thee well!
Once trusty rod of steel
In thee, alas! I feel
That I must cease to trust;
And thou art doomed to rust.
Fare thee well!
Unless, in after years,
With partizans and spears,
Kept burnish'd thou may'st.be
In antique armoury.
Far? thee well!
But wherefore do I stand,
Still grasping thee in hand,
Leave-taking o'er and o'er,
And sighing, yet once more—
Fare thee well P
Because I'm made to wait,
With fire-arms out of date,
For warfare tools unmeet,
So, therefore, I repeat—
Fare thee well!
O, that I could outright
Armed for effectual fight
At instantaneous call
Say, Ramrod, once for all,
Fare thee well!
BOOKLETS.
"Op the making of books there is no end." Did not Socrates, or
Scioppius, or Sardanapaltjs once say something like this P Whoever
it was, he would have been great ly astounded had he lived in these
times, and seen the daily multiplication of volumes, and the alarming
spread of that fatal epidemic, cacofthes scribendi. Everywhere hand-
books, manuals, introductions, guides to the smallest, as well as the
most important of the many businesses of life; one of the latest being
The Book of Dinner Serviettes, the author of which was certainly deter-
mined not to fly too high in his search for a subject.
We look forward to seeing many more useful manuals7of [the same
class, such as The Book of Dressing Table Pincushions, The Book of
Bedchamber Watch-Pockets, &c, ahd sincerely hope that they may com-
mand.as large a sale as they deserve.
Our Reserve Force.
"The annual inspection of the 4th Administrative Battalion of the • • •
Eifle Volunteers took place yesterday evening on the drill-ground. After
falling out, the men were served with supper in the drill-shed."
Sorry to hear it. These are not times for Volunteers to be falling
out. We feel sure all Riflemen will fall in with our views on this
point. However, as the men took supper together, we hope there was
no great harm done; but we trust such a state of things (with the
exception of the supper) will not occur again.

FIRE AND SMOKE.
"Sou" writes a correspondent of Public Opinion, signing his name
Thom. S. Passmore, "Mr, Ch. Cooke, iu your last issue, most sen-
sibly and truly says that 'War clears the moral atmosphere, as
thunderstorms do the terrestrial one.'" No, Mr. Passmore. Mr. Ch.
Cooke's observation has very little truth in it, and no sense at all.
War may, now and then, clear the moral atmosphere, but generally
thickens it. For war, fnend Passmore, look you, must needs be a
contest either of armed fools with armed fools, armed thieves
with armed thieves, or armed thieves with armed policemen. In
the latter case only does war clear the [moral atmosphere. Then it
clears the moral atmosphere of blackguardism in proportion to
the magnitude of the policemen's victory over the thieves, and
the' amount of the butcher's bill the thieves let themselves in for.
Otherwise, it clears the moral atmosphere no more than the physical.
On the contrary, it equally obscures the one and the other. It throws
back civilisation for many years. Familiarising people with carnage
and destruction, it comes to be regarded by them with levity, at least
until they finally draw it down upon themselves. It increases brutality
among the multitude, and it gives occasion to the malignant portion of
the educated classes to sneer at pacific counsels with tongue and pen,
and cry, "Ridiculous are the Peacemakers." The fire and smoke with
which it loads the air we breathe bodily, correspond to the heats and
the darkness which it engenders in that which our minds inhale. War,
unless when just and successful, can clear the moral, atmosphere only
by clearing it of morality.

THE ADVANTAGE OF A STATE OF SIEGE.
We have no decided wish to be in Paris just at present; indeed, we
thank our stars decidedly that we are here in London. Still, in some
respects we own that Paris is just now in an enviable state, although a
state of siege at first thought may seem anything but enviable. But
only fancy this as one of its advantages :—
"A decree of General Trochu orders the expulsion from Paris of every
individual having no honest means of subsistence, and whose presence is a
danger to public order, and to the safety of persons and property.
If this be a result of living in a state of siege, one really can't help
wishing that London were forthwith declared in that condition. What
a blessing it would be to all its peaceable inhabitants to get rid of all
the burglars, and the beggars, and the blackguards, who endanger now
the safety of our persons and our property! We often pride ourselves
upon our insular security, and delight to think that we are therefore safe
against invasion, and that no one from abroad can venture to assail us.
But we forget the many enemies who are daily in our midst, and nightly
ready to attack us. We should be glad to declare London in a state
of siege to-morrow, if Mr. Bill Sikes and his brethren could for ever
so be banished; but we sadly fear those gentlemen would return to
their old haunts directly that same state were announced as being
ended.
MUNIFICENCE OF A MAYOR EXTRAORDINARY.
In a summary of memorable affairs at Winchester, the Hampshire
Independent records a manifestation of benevolence on the part of a
municipal dignitary, which, to most municipalities, will probably appear
very eccentric. Worshipful Mayors and Aldermen at large are in-
formed, no doubt to their astonishment, that :—
The Mayor's Munificence—of which we have already had evidence on
several occasions, is again shown by the fact that on Tuesday, after the meet-
ing of the Town Council, a meeting of the Committee in aid of the 8ick and
Wounded in War was held, and his Worship then said that instead of giving.
as usual, a banquet to the Corporation, he should give a hundred guinens to
the Sick and Wounded Fund. May his example spur on others to go and do,
in some measure, likewise!
A Mayor giving a hundred guineas for the relief of sick and wounded
foreigners, instead of giving a dinner to his own Corporation and country-
men, is likely to be regarded by the majority of his compeers, as a
person who, so far from being imitated, ought to be taken care of by
his friends. Mankind in general may say that a sum of money,
devoted to a sick and wounded fund, is better employed than it would
be if spent upon what some of them possibly denominate a gorge. Nor
can this view be reasonably denied; although, no doubt, if Mr. Under-
wood, the Mayor, in preference to relieving the sufferers under wounds
and sickness, were to feast the Corporation, City Officers, Dean and
Chapter, College Warden, and Fellows of Winchester, he would do an
aet of charity, at least inasmuch as he would feed the hungry, though
not the starving.
Prelates carefully Preserved.
Purlicity ought to be given to the fact, not perhaps generally
known, that the British Museum possesses a most interesting collec-
tion of stuffed archbishops, several cases in one of the Natural History
Saloons being devoted to The Primates."
The Force of Habit.
We know a City gentleman who is so extremely methodical in
business, that when he pays a compliment even to his wife, he always
will insist on taking a receipt.
not very far wrong.
Mrs. Malaprop says that every one ought to contribute as hand-
somely as possible to the fund for the relief of the wounded, because
that will be acting like a good Sanitarian.

MRS. WIGSBY ON THE WAR.

above them as orders the
battaliums; as if the battles

back. How did this rumpus,
which it's fearful to think of,
5j all begin P In the fast place
theProoshans and Austrians
together unjustly attackted and plundered Denmark. To be sure,
what the poor Banes had done to desarve to be attackted and plundered,
I don't know. No more I don't know what the old gentleman had
done as was murdered t' other day—but he as murdered him was 'ung
for it. Very well: and what 'appened to them as plundered and mur-
dered the Danes? Direckly, a'most, Austria and Prooaha fell out.
They quarreled over their beauty, and the Austrians and Prooshans
set to and massacreed one another. A few years goes by, and then the
French, out o' mere pride and wain-glory and envy of their neighbours,
without any cause to justify 'em, whatsomedever, in wades the
Prooshans. See what they've got by it. Sartingly the Prooshans
suffers pretty nearly as much; and when they considers how they made
the Danes suffer, p'raps it may come 'ome to 'em. There! Suppose

"BLOOD AND IRON."
"By Blood and Iron," quoth Bismarck,
"Must Germany be made:"
And with blood and iron his mark
On Germany he has laid:
And in France's flank, too, is mark
Of his keen two-edged blade.
Strong is the welding power
That blood and iron wield
When the Man comes, with the Hour,'
And the righteous battle-field,
Where the iron's hail and shower
Of blood, their harvest yield.
Harvest of self-devotion,
Of faith in a noble cause,
That holy and high emotion
To which death gives no pause—
This of blood is worth an ocean,
To this men's lives are straws.
Nor this the only harvest
Thou, Germany, shalt reap
With the sword, wherewith thou carvest
Thy path to the Gaulish keep;
What though on thy way thou starvest,
Or wadest in blood knee-deep P
Beyond this blood and brattle
Lies sunshine for thee and calm:
Through the mitrailleuse's rattle
Thou hear'st Peace chaunt her psalm;
On the red wounds of battle,
Feelest her shed her balm.
With "iron and blood" thou'rt paying
The toll that clears thy road,
To fields where the sun is playing
On the harvest thou hast sowed,
To be reaped 'gainst all gainsaying
Of foes, to the final load.
The harvest of patient Learning,
Of Peace's crafts and arts;
Of Science's sharp discerning,
And Labour's busy marts;
Of home-affections yearning,
And law-abiding hearts.
A harvest worth thy sowing
With "blood and iron" seed,
Though sown by hands unknowing
The harvests' mighty meed,
Who saw no green nude growing,
Or scorned it for a weed.
But before blood and iron
Can yield this harvest rare
Bight soil must the seed environ,
And nurture of breezes fair.
That seed heap filthy mire on,
Or give it poisoned air,
And in the germ unquickened
'Twill die, a barren thing,
Or with such nurture quickened,
In a warp'd growth it will spring,
Where blood to mud seems thickened,
And where iron hath no ring.
How oft with blood and iron
Hath not France sowed her soil,
While Hope sang, like the Syren,
Swift harvests of her toil,
Till the sowers France wreaked her ire on,
And their labours made a spoil.
What blood and iron sowing
In Ninety-Two shot hate;
And lo! their harvest growing
In France's humbled state.
With civil strife o'erflowing,
The conqueror at her gate!
"Blood and iron" Europe over,
Broadcast Napolron shed,
From the sea that guardeth Dover
To the Neva's icy bed 1
Could the chieftain s harvest cover
His island prison bed P
And what harvest reaped the nation
Of his " blood and iron" seed,
But war and desolation,
Spent fields, and stunted breed;
The invader's proud dictation,
And the vanquished's bitter meed P
After uncle nephew soweth
His "blood and iron," too,
In the Boulevard volley that moweth
The fools, who take for true
The mask wherein he goeth
The Republic to undo.
What. France, shall for this reaping
Of blood and iron" grow,
Wasted in false men's keeping
On fields won by the foe P
What harvest, but the weeping
Of shame and wrath and woe.
And strife and hates unsleeping,
And utter overthrow I

FOREIGNERS IN FRANCE.
"Little Podqers" is Staying at "Grenouilleville dans lis Marais," and Complains that he can't "Go to Nature"
WITHOUT BEING CLOSELY WATCHED BY THOSE CONFOUNDED GENDABMES. He ASKS, DOBS HE LOOK LIKE A PRUSSIAN SPT!
THE WORST OF SAVAGES.
After having read the descriptions of the carnage and the state of
the wounded, sent us from the seat of war, it is comparatively cheering
to read the details of the late massacre at Tien-Tsin, although the
Times most truly says of them:—
"The details are too horrible for repetition. It ie enough to say that all
the cruelty and barbarity of which the Chineae nature is capable were
wreaked on the Frenchmen and the helpless Frenchwomen who happened to
be within reach of the mob."
But the number of the killed amounted altogether to no more than
twenty-two Europeans and about forty natives at the outside ; and
there were no wounded at all, or few if any. The Chinese, too, had
some shadow of provocation, if not excuse, to extenuate, in a measure,
the atrocities which they committed. They had reason to suspect that
the French Missionaries attached to the Orphanage, were accustomed,
through bribery, to kidnap native children, as the priests at Rome kid-
napped the Jew-boy, in order to keep them from growing up in Foism
or Buddhism, and train them up in Romanism. To ascertain the truth or
fallacy of this suspicion the local authorities besought the Missionaries to
allow their Orphanage to be inspected, which those reverend gentle-
men, with the secretivencss characteristic of their cloth, refused. Of
course, it was as ridiculous of the heathen Chinese, as it is of the
British Protestant Public, to suppose that, in the case of any Romanist
establishment, systematic concealment can mean that there is anything
to conceal. But bigots are bigots, and barbarians are barbarians,
British and foreign; and what can you expect from a hog but a grunt r
Something worse, if the hog is a savage boar; and the Chinese at
Tien-Tsin behaved after their kind under the fury excited by their
sense, however imaginary, of outraged love of offspring. And then
the Chinese are, as aforesaid, heathens. Altogether, therefore, the
massacre at Tien-Tsin, although perfectly diabolical, contrasts most
favourably with the war now raging between two Christian nations,
and the conduct of the Chinese mob appears to immense advantage in
comparison with that of the aggressors responsible for that disgrace to
both Christianity and civilisation.
MOUSETRAP! MARRY, HOW P
Never may Mr. Punch have to publish a cartoon corresponding to
the work of humorous art thus described by a correspondent of the
Times in Paris:—
"The Parisian is intensely hopeful, and a caricature published yesterday is
a perfect image of his thought. There is a huge mousetrap, on the raised
doorway of which is inscribed 'France.' A regiment of mice dressed as
Prussian soldiers are marching towards it. Their leader points with his
sword to the cheese inside, which has the tempting inscription—' Paris.'"
May timely provision of a more than sufficient Navy, and of an
amply sufficient Army, secure Punch against the sorrow of being ever
obliged to illustrate the national situation by representing foreign
troops as mice marching on the Cheese, that cheese being the Cheshire
Cheese, Fleet Street, and, though over the way, situated near Mr.
Punch's Office.
Well, but when our Parisian friends have trapped the mice, what
then P Perhaps the cat will be let out of the bag.
Autumnal Reflection.
The reapers now with scythe in hand
Amid the yellow corn-fields stand:
What pleasure 'tis to watch each cutter,
And think of future bread and butter!
A LITTLE 8T0KY.

recognition of his valuable services as Honorary Secretary to the Bec-
clesham Bowling Club, his friends congratulated him on having some-

reply—" Melted down, more likely."

THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.
THE CLUB VISITS LEIDEN—NOTES BY THE WAT—OBJECTS OF IN-
TEREST—JOMP IN THE VEIN—RETURN TO THE HAGUE.
"Now, Jomp," says Bund, " have yon ordered the carriage P"
"O yes," replies Jomp, deprecating the Commander's insinuation
that he had allowed such a command as that to slip his memory, "O
yes; the carriage vill be ready "He thinks it out; and, 'without
committing himself to a positive moment for the appearance of the
carriage, adds, "Ven the orses shall be in it."
"Quel espece—" begins Gooch, and then corrects himself, as if he'd
really quite forgotten nia native tongue, and run into French so easily
that it was a difficult matter to get out of it again—" I mean, what
sort"—he emphasises this, as his translation—" what sort of a place w
Leiden P" Then, by way of a relapse, " Triste, n'estce pas?"
"Bien triste," answers Muntley.
"Vous avcz raison!" says Finton. They are immensely pleased
with themselves after this, which is what they call airing their French
for practice. When they want to keep up a conversation in this lan-
guage, they explain their meaning to one another in English, and so
get along excellently.
Jomp polishes his head with his handkerchief (" That—Boomp-je!—
old rag!" growls Gooch, for the hundredth time, "I must get him a
new one! ), looks at Maullie, who is sitting in an arm-chair at the
window, "taking a bit," and replies,
"Veil—Leiden—O yes!"—here he ruminates, as if recalling happy
scenes of his childhood passed in Leiden—" Veil—um—um—O yes f
Then, having thought it well out, he adds, "O yes, you can go to
Leiden," and looks round upon us with the air of a man who has re-
moved an almost insurmountable difficulty.
"Murray says," observes Bund, referring to his guide, as a means
of refreshing Jomr's memory, and rather as if Jomp had written this por-
tion of Murray, and was to be held responsible for it. "Murray says—
ah—where's the placeP" Bund has got about a dozen different
markers in Murray, and generally exhausts the Rhine before finding
what he is really looking for— Ah! here it is! Now—let's see.
'Leiden,'" he reads at intervals—'"was called Lugdunum Bata-
vorum.' Jomp smiles at this, as if he didn't believe it. Bund pro-
ceeds :"' There's a fragment of a round tower'—hem—' Drusus '—yes
—'Anglo-Saxon Hengist'—nothing that concerns us particularly."
Jomp looks on in an attentive attitude, but with the fixed inane smile of
a big head in a pantomime. Bund, having skipped over some paragraphs,
as we suppose, continues: "'It stands in a tea-garden "Here he
pauses, puzzled.
"What stands in a tea-garden P" asks Maullie, who is cross
because he considers that every minute spent out of a picture-gallery
is so much time wasted.
"What sort of a place is the tea-garden P" asks Bund of Jomp.
"Une espece de Mabille P" suggests Gooch.
"A sort of Mabille, is it P" translates Muntley.
"Or Rosherville P Amendment from Finton.
Jomp thinks it out. "Veil—um—um—um—you can 'ave tea dere,
if you like." He shrugs his shoulders as much as to say that he, per-
sonally, couldn't recommend it.
"But," urges Gooch, who sees a cafe chantant looming in proba-
bility, " is there any fun there P"
"Any band P" throws in the Commander, thinking of his violoncello
at home.
"Veil," replies Jomp, considering his evidence in a way that would
drive a Judge and Counsel wild, and give a Special Jury the fidgets;
"veil—dere's—dere's a—garden for tea, you know—O yes!"
"Any pictures P " demands Maullie, sharply.
"Veil—um—um." Jomp, becoming very warm from some interior
conflict, mops his head with the handkerchief, and finally, putting his
hands behind him with the bearing of a man prepared to die a martyr
to his love of truth, says, "1 do not know. I'ave never been dere"
"Then, why the—Boompje I "from everybody.
"Cairiage ready!" the Waiter announces, and Jomp escapes.
On the road to Leiden Bund proposes to read Murray's account of
it to us. The country is monotonous, and the new entertainment of'a
reading from Murray partakes of the same character. In half an hour
all are asleep. I employ the remainder of the drive in making the
following observations:
My impression of Holland—up to now (KB. Confirmed hereafter).—
From first to last all is Boompje, utter Boompje, unmitigated Boompje.
Understanding that Boompje be always used in our accepted Club
sense. Murray's travellers, be they who they may, from lucky Number
One, who does all the good hotels, to! poor Number Five, who only
lives to tell others what to avoid, arc all robustious, periwig-pated
fellows.
In five words (that is, in threepennorth of modern post-office tele-
graphic expression), I am disappointed with Holland. Bund is not;
for he believes in Murray, and the blameless Bradshaw. What Murray,
says, Bund, our Commodore, sticks to. Maullie does to Hollanders
what the Hollanders did to their own country when they made it what
it is; I need say no more. Boompje! But Maullie, R.A., is eager
for pictures, and swears to see every public and private collection in
Holland; even if he has to lug out private collectors by the collar.
As for Gooch, Holland is not Paris; and to him Paris is the Continent.
But why did Murray lead me to expect so much in Holland P Why
does he say (quoting, perhaps, but no matter, he adopts it) "that here the
order of Nature is inverted. Here, in effect, fishes swim into your bed-
room window. That here you live two thousand feet below the level of
any known ser. Why am I given to understand that my drives are to
be under water. By Murray I am led to expect that for the shooting
season one must take out a licence to fire at red herrings, but sprats
are vermin. Izaak WALTON.if here, would have toangle for jackdaws,
troll for cocksparrows, and bottom-fish for larks. We were to be
in a sort of dry Bed Sea land with water walL> on either side. All the
trees would be (I expected) of seaweed y character, and I was to be (I
had fondly hoped) awoke in the morning by the piping of a fresh cock
salmon on the upper branches. But what is the fact P Why simply
ihat the country is flat, and canalled, instead of tunnelled, as it would
have been if mountainous; that in the towns you are as much above
the canals as Londoners are when walking along the Harrow Boad by
the side of the canal, name of which I don't know, never did, and never
shall, but it seems to me to rise somewhere in Paddington, to meander
at right angles about the pleasant vale of Maida, to disappear some-
where at a small outpost of London (where mortuary stone works are
made, suggesting the idea that those mighty efforts of the sculptor's
art in the New Boad had come down here for an airing), and to lose
itself finally in the country, probably in the Uxbridge direction. This
repeated, without any undulation of country, is Holland: that is, an
eternal canal, and something to walk on on either side, with bridges to
cross it when you want to vary the monotony of being on the left bank
by changing it for the right.
There is a good deal of bright polished brass about Holland, as you
might expect in a Boompje land.
While writing the above it occurs to me that a free translation of
"Boompje," as settled and fixed by the Club Dictionary, would be
"Bouncer
Leiden at last.—What shall we doP Evidently to begin with
waking up. We wake up. Here is Leiden. Ask the coachman.
Can't, he's a Dutchman. Tell Jomp to ask Dutch coachman what
we 're to do here. No use. Jomp tries. As usual, Dutch coachman
can't understand a single word. Jomp shrugs his shoulders pityingly.
We manage, between Jomp's Dutch (limited), our French and
English, to make an intelligent Baker understand us. The process is a
long one, and all Leiden is out-of-doors to hear and see, and, if
possible, join in the conversation.
"'Pon my soul," exclaims Gooch, in a tone of unmitigated disgust,
"We 're being mobbed wherever we go. We might as well be that
cracked Chinaman, or the Japanese ambassadors, in London. Confound
it, it's too bad." He is very wrathful with Bund and Jomp. but
settles down ultimately on Maullie. "If he was only dressed like a
civilised Christian, and not in that Boompje hat and tourist suit, they
wouldn't stare at us like barbarians. Hang 'em I"
"Are there no objects of interest here P" asks Muntley, in the
rumble. "Yes," growls Gooch, "u>e are: confound it."
We try to gather information from the intelligent inhabitants of Leiden.
"Is there a church to be seen here P" This puzzles them for ten minutes,
during which time we repeat the question in all sorts of forms, and
in ingenious variations of languages. The intelligent Baker, assisted
by our intelligent coachman, who rouses himself for an effort, suddenly
grasps the meaning of our question. He explains to the populace (a
crowd of about forty people of all ages and sizes), who take up the
reply as a part-song tor several voices. Hopelessly unintelligible. We
demand a solo by the Baker, or the Coachman. They insist on making
it a duett. (Gooch, writhing, says, "Boompje 'em—drive on: do I
but we don't stir.) From a solo by some one we are given to under-
stand that there is no church open. ("It's a Protestant country," says
Gooch ; "they don't keep 'em open. Hang it! let's drive back again."
but we don't stir.) We insist that there must be a church worth see-
ing. The populace (after five minutes allowed to reduce this to intelligi-
bility) ridicule the idea of our being driven over from the Hague to go
to Church. (" They think we 're mad. Do drive on!" says Gooch,
piteously.) Maullie asks boldly for the Stadhuis. They don't know
it. "Not the StadhuisP" reiterates Maullie. surprised. No: not
the Stadhuis. "Then isn't the University worth seeing P" Populace
take this up as a riddle (it seems as if we are a travelling company for
conundrums), and after considering it in parts as before, put the puzzle
together, and the answer is No. "O!" exclaims Gooch, "you be
Boompje'd. Here, let's get out and walk about the town."
We discover the University at last. Down a street: very retired.
It could be put into Trinity Hall's waistcoat-pocket. There are some
comic drawings on the wall of the staircase, representing a scholar
leaving home for the Academy, and his return therefrom. Dutch boy's
humour. We yawn about the place. We ask about Jran op Leiden.

We inquire for (Murray's) Botanical Garden, the Egyptian Museum,
the Churches of St. Peter and St. Fancrar. Nobody knows, uubodt
cares. It is vacation time. Leiden is asleep. Our conundrums art
all given up, and we return to our carriage.
Dull road home. Bund reads extracts from Murray as to what we
ought to have seen. Bund turns on Jomp:
You ought to have known all about it. It's your business. You
said you'd been all over this country before. And if you hadn't been,
you ought to have made all the inquiries, or sent somebody with us
who could take us everywhere."
"Veil." replies Jomp, deeply injured, and almost shedding tears,
"I say dat I ave not been in Leiden. I cannot tell jou vot I do not
know."
Finton, in the rumble, is humming the march from the Prophete:
inspired by Leiden. Suddenly, he stops, and addresses us: "1 say,
-what a capital match Jran of Leiden and Joan of Arc would have
made! Almost the same dress, too."
This induces meditation, and we wake up at the Hague.
A ROMAN POSTER.
A letter from Cardinal Antonelli, forwarded to Archrishop
Manning, and published by the latter, states, with reference to the
"Apostolical Constitution," constituting the Pope infallible, that:—
"The Constitution in question had the most solemn publication possible on
the very day upon which, in the Vatican Basilica, it was solemnly confirmed
and promulgated by the Sovereign Pontiff in the presence of above five
hundred Bishops; for it was then, although such was not necessary in this
case, put up with the ordinary formalities in the usual places of Rome; in
consequence of which it was, according to the well-known rule, made obli-
gatory for the whole Catholic world, without need of any other publication
whatsoever."
Thus, Pio Nono, though he claims to be a greater man than Moses
the Lawgiver, condescends to advertise himself after the fashion of
Moses and Son, and, albeit professing intmite superiority to the
Prophet Samuel, disdains not recourse to means of obtaining publi-
city such as those employed by Samuel Brothers. In short, the
Holy Father bills the town of Rome, and sticks up posters about the
Eternal City. Fancy a specimen of one of these papal (not to speak
profanely) puffs:—

LITERARY ANECDOTE.
Rrading a capital letter in the Teltaraph, our friend Mrs. Jones
came on the words, "France is pullulating." "Meaning of that
word, quick P" she demanded of her nephew Sammy. "Germinating,
| aunt, promptly responded the "well-educated infant." After some
thought. Aunt Jones observed, "Very right; if I were French I
should be German-hating, too." Sammy hooted, but bolted in time to
escape a box on his irreverent ears.
WAR NEWS.
Date.—September. Place.—All over the Shop.
I'm obliged to give you the above evasive answer, your Noble
Washup/ons a Cockalorum who lets outwhere he is and when he is, might,
be told off to Chokey as a gay spy any morning. And sarve him
right, too, says the Duchess, as I told the Hereditary Grand when he
warned me.
"What Duchess ?" asked the Hereditary Swell in command. "It's
a story, my nnble Lord and Marquis," says I. "Forwards," says the
Hereditary Grand, meaning, to this intelligent Militaire, that he 'd
rather like it than not.
"The story's only this," says I, so on we goes : "The Duchess was
sitting down to ter. 'Hullo!' says the Dook, looking in. 'What's
up F' says the Duchess, sugaring. 'Why,' says the Dook,' I'm .'"
Here Young Singymaringy (as I call him, and he likes it now)
looked in, and the Hereditary Grand says, "Captain," to me, "to be
continued in our next."
"Right you are!" says this gay Warrior, and mounts his gallant
Gee. So he didn't hear it this journey.
Rather hard lines on Your Own Lightheaded Soldier just now. To
be up with the cockeoly bird, and polishing the pigskin on the ambling
Gee for ten hours off the reel, takes the starch out of this gay Militaire,
and as to sleeping, your Noble Washup, we don't seek the virtuous
until very small hours.
I'm on .1 he Staff (sort of supernumerary with the chill off) of the
Crown Cockalorum Commander-in-Chief. The careering Gee did it.
The Hereditary took a fancy to it. "Captain," says he, " 1 like your
tit." "Yours truly, your Washup," says this gay Cavalier, "and 1 'II
back him against any Gee of his own size, weight, and age, head and
tail screwed on the right way, for a trotting match, or a hurdle race;
jump over an umbrella, or a barge pole on a high road, for money."
"As a charger P" says he.
"All there when the bell rings," was Your Own's reply. We split a
neutral B. and S. together, and in half an hour I'd a Uhlan's sabre by
my side, ready to show what gimlet means to an unfriendly Cockalorum.
Since then I've been careering.
These Gay Prooshans ain't quite the noble sportsman on horseback.
They stick on somehow like gum, through a line of gates, but across
the open after the Wily, pounded's the word, my Noble Marquis, for
the lot of 'em.
*****
Next day.
Up, Cockalorums, and at 'em! We're on 'em in spadefuls. Never
was such times. "Pay as we go," is the order. I am chiefly billeted
with Singymaringy. He pays and I go. He's a well-meaning Cock-
alorum, but rather cornered here. He was inclined to be nasty at firs',
when 1 chaffed him with, " Thou art the cause of this here anguish, my
Singymaringy," but a look from me soon convinced him that I could
double up his perambulator.
This Gay and Gallant ain't, as yon know, in the habit of quarrelling
with his wittles. But—though m the Champagne country we don't,
bustle the sparkling, and the wine of this place is so uncommon like
the vinegar of any other place that just now grapes is sour, your noble
Washup. There's nothing round in the month to cross your poor
Soldiers lips. Singymaringy goes in heavy for goat's milk. It's
enough to make jour hair curl for a twelvemonth to look al. him sucking
it out of a wooden bowl. Gently does it with this gay Militaire in that
quarter, as your Own Cockalorum can't afford to have the Herr Doc-
torum dosing him for the papsylals.

THE BRITISH BLUNDERBUSS.
"A Progressive Officer," in a letter to the Times, quotes a state-
ment by Ms. Cahdwell, to the effect " that the arming of the Militia
with Snider breechloaders is to be 'gradually' completed, after which
the Volunteers are to be ' gradually' armed with the same weapon."
Gradually; "a good phrase," as Justice Shallow says. It comes from
gradus, a step, and, considering how likely we are, in the event of
invasion, to be gradually invaded, may we not venture to use military
language in so far as to name that step a goose-step t
The Progressive Officer moreovi r ayers that, several jeais ago,
he had pointed out in the Times that "at the best, the Snider was only
a makeshift;" and adds :—
"That was in July, 1866, and here we are in August, 1870, with the
question of a small-bore breechloader still unsettled, and the prospect of
further experiments, and consequently further delay, before anything is
done."
If the question of a small-bore remains unsettled, the question of a
great bore has been placed beyond doubt. It is evident that the Head
at the administrative Head Quarters is wanting in brains; which is a
very great bore. Behind foreign troops in respect of his weapon, can
even t he Briltsh Grenadier be expected to stand before them in the
field P
INVADERS INVADED.
A Correspondent of the Constitulionnel, writing from Melz, makes
a remark about the Prussian troops which is rather ingenuous :—
"It is true that when they penetrate anywhere they take everything, and
live at the cost of other people. We learn this every moment from the unfor-
tunate inhabitants of the frontier, who flock hither with tbe little property
they have been able to save, and not only do the Prussians lay violent hands
on provisions, cattle, horses, carriages, forage, &c., but on money also, uftcr
which they set fire to the country."
As a matter of fact it is somewhat doubtful that the Prussian soldiers
actually return evil for evil, when, in so doing, they would actcontraiy
to orders. But suppose they did plunder or burn everything in their
way on their march into France. Such conduct, although opposed to
the injunction which requires people absolutely to love their enemies,
is not very uunatural, in an enemy's country, on the part of invaders
advancing in repulse of invasion.

EXTRACTS FROM MY COMMON-PLACE BOOK.
(KB. The Authorities will be kept till called for.)
aklt Science has its mar-
tyrs: so has the (tout.
What an ancient and uni-
versal game is Billiards!
There are traces of it
amongst the Early Chris-
tians, and in _ Domesday
Book; the Ancient Britons
introduced it at their even-
ing parties; and when Cap-
tain Cook was at Otaheite,
the Prime Minister wanted
to play him for a missionary
a side, but the great cir-
cumlocutionist declined, and
the Funds did the same in
consequence.
The consumption of snuff
has of late years audibly
diminished in the best so-
ciety, and the time is pro-
bably not far distant when
the species will become ex-
tinct. The Quakers have
long been its principal sup-
porters, but they are gra-
r~ dually discarding the pecu-
liar garb of the Society, and
are moving up every day closer to the West End of the metropolis.
Deep sea dredgiDg has yielded many valuable spoils to the votaries
of Science, but the dredeery of it is more than an ordinary man can
stand in his stockings. King Canute's left slipper, some combs and
brushes which appear to have belonged to a young (mer) ladies' school,
a copy of "Rule, Britannia," appropriately bound in watered silk, the
anchor which was lost by a fluke in the great naval engagement, of
the first of April, between the Hollanders and the Dutch off Cape Cor-
morant, the bones of the Flying Dutchman, one of Neptune's tridents
(electro-plate only). Admiral Kempenpelt's wig, Sir Clotjdeslet
Shovel s toothpick, Sir Humphret Davy Jones s locker, and many
other most interesting curiosities may be seen on application at the
Society's offices from ten to four.
Probably the oldest toys in the world are mountain tops.
The only animal which is indigenous to every country hitherto dis-
covered by members of the Geographical Society and the Press, is the
toad eater.
The origin of- our Sumptuary Laws, which were repealed as often as
possible, is involved in obscurity and a dispute in the Courts of Law,
and there is not a word about it in any Post Office Directory to which
the public have access.
The best authors are all agreed that there have not been one-third
so many quarrels since the feudal system was abolished.
In time of war provisions and balloons go up, the Funds and all
sorts of extraordinary stories go down.
The name of the lady who was the object of Plato's platonic attach-
ment has not been transmitted to an indignant posterity.
The original inhabitants of these Islands had no epigrams, but they
mixed toddy to perfection. They had no diplomatic relations, but
plenty of poor ones, whom they always invited to dinner on Christmas-
Day, and sent home in a cab, carriage paid. Furthermore, they culti-
vated mistletoe for the London market, and were respected.by all who
knew them.
The wise men of one generation are the old women of the next.
Just as manikin is the diminutive of man, so pumpkin is the en-
dearing diminutive of pump.
The rainfall in the course of the year is greater in some countries
than in others, and is thought to vary with the weather. In like
manner, the fruit crop fluctuates according to the price of dessert ser-
vices; but no connection has, up to the time of going to press, been
discovered between the heat of debate and the public readings of the
thermometer on the shady side of Pall Mall, nor is it expected to occur
again within the memory of man.
Cupid presides over love marriages—Cupidity over matches made for
money.
The alliterative and epigrammatic remark, that punctuation is the
politeness of princes, has at last been traced (by the courtesy of Notes
and Queries), to its lawful owner—it was not Talleyrand who said
it, but Mks. Malaprof.
The climate of Madagascar has lately been subjected to a searching
chemical analysis by three of the first physicians of the day. The
result is most gratifying to every wellwisher of humanity. It is com-
posed of unequal parts of oxygen, ozone, common salt, and the breath
of popular applause, and may be had in bottles for exportation.
York Cathedral was built a few weeks later than Canterbury, and
Devizes is senior to both; but the Chapter House at Lincoln, which is
Early Horizontal, ranks as the most ancient specimen of ecclesiastical
architecture in tnis, or, indeed, any other country, being beyond the
recollection of the oldest inhabitant.
Snowballs were first manufactured in the sixth century.

In choir combine,

And, afterward,
Their fat and lard,
Which France doth need
For whom they bled.
Not only they!
But you, to-day,
Meanwhile do thrive.
O pray and strive
That England's peace
May never cease,
Nor foreign arms
Despoil your farms.

ROYAL ETIQUETTE MADE EASY.
Animadverting on the prolonged absence of the Queen from the
seat of Government (necessitated by the state of Her Majesty's
hea\lh) Economist remarks that "For years she has never slept in
London." Mr. Punch begs to go farther and say that, during the
whole of that time his Royal Mistress has remained wide awake every-
where else. Having said that, he may be permitted to take the liberty
of expressing his concurrence with the Economist's following suggestion:
"Suppose we add another constitutional fiction to the number already
existing, and hold that the Sovereign always is either in London or Windsor,
and if he is absent permit the Puemieu to presume that he is present, and to
sign documents in his name."
For the look of the thing, Her Most Gracious Majesty's signature
might be stereotyped, and Mr. Gladstone, or whosoever else may
hereafter be her Premier for the time being, empowered to stamp it at
the foot of all documents whereunto its subscription is a mere formality.
If Mr. Punch's adored Sovereign would vouchsafe to take a leaf out
of her servant's book, he would point to his own frontispiece, as ex-
emplifying an economy of time and trouble exactly like that which
would satisfy the Economist, and which everybody who sings the
National Anthem with a will must wish to save the Queen.
THOUGHTS FOR TALKERS.
There are proper times for talking, as well as proper themes for it.
Men should take care not to talk much when their mouths are full, or
when their heads are empty. In the former case they nauseate, m the latter
one they bore. Unless a man has something sensible to say, he cer-
tainly had better be contented without saying it. A good listener is
as hard to find as a good talker, and yet the knack of listening is easy
of attainment. H one only can contrive to look as though one listens,
one may often get the credit of actually doing so. .
When a company of talkers are thundering away, their thunder
ought to be attended by a brilliant flash of silence on the part of some
food listeners. Conversation when all talk is noise, not conversation.
Vhen ladies talk together, their tongues move all at once, and no one
ever stops to listen. This is why among themselves ladies talk such
utter nonsense. But ladies can talk sense when they have men of
sense to talk to, for then they take the trouble to say something worth
answering. If every one keeps talking, nobody takes heed of what
anybody says, and nobody is therefore any wiser for their saying it.
Remember when you talk that very often listening pleases more than
talking. By listening to a man you pay him a great compliment, for
you delicately indicate that what he says is worth your hearing. More-
over, though by listening you may hear unpleasant things, the occupa-
tion often saves you from the chance of saying them. In short, though
it mav seem anomalous to say it, one of the greatest charms of talking
is to hold one's tongue well. The man who holds his tongue in course
of conversation, will often give more pleasure than the man who merely
uses it.
Le Boze et la Guerre.
Nations do not practise the noble art of self-defence after the fashion
of the British Prize Ring. That is to be regretted. It is a pity the
French have no Second. If they had one, he would, before they lose
everything but honour, throw up the sponge for them.

Emilt Cariserooke, who has already " officiated " at the weddings

ON THE MOORS.
Mr. Skapwinckr, who His a View to a "Bio Bag" off his Moor in as Short a Time as Possirle, and who can't See
WHY YOU SHOULD SHUT YOUR EYES TO THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE, CONTRIVES A MlTBAILLBUSB ON A PRINCIPLE OF HIS OWN.
The Keepers are Disgusted I
THE LOGIC OF TOTAL ABSTINENCE.
Some wise things were said at the Temperance Fete held the other
day in the Crystal Palace. Mr. S. Bowlet, President of the Tem-
perance League, proclaimed from the Chair that:—
"Three great scourges had long afflioted mankind—namely, slavery, war,
and intemperance, ana he believed that total abstinence was the only remedy
for them all."
The Mahometan nations are all total abstainers, and see how free
and how peaceful they have ever been. Allah Hu!
Mr. Bowlet also said:—
"What he contended for was, that they could not have a moderate war. If
they had war at all, it would ever go into excesses of cruelty and death.
So alto he contended they could not, nationally speaking, have moderate
drinking; it would be always in excess, and could never be controlled."
The Spaniards used always to be credited with moderation in their
drinking, and it is needless to say what a drunken set of fellows they
all are. Besides, nothing can be more self-evident than that what is
generally true as concerning war, is equally true with regard to drink-
ing. That is clear as mud.
Man, being reasonable, must get drunk," is a line which, con-
versely, implies that teetotallers are destitute of reason. Lord Byron
would never have written it if foreknowledge had acquainted him with
the conclusiveness of their reasoning.
BIRDS AND BUMPKINS.
"A Protesting Ratepayer" in the Daily News, records his pro-
test against the payment, by the Churchwarden, sanctioned by the
Vestry, of a village in Northamptonshire, at the parochial expense, of
the sum of £25 for the destruction of sparrows and their eggs, to the
number of as many as thirty thousand birds whose value, in New
Zealand, would be 'so many thousand pounds. Were jEsof still
extant, he might tell the parochial bumpkins of a village in Northamp-
tonshire, and many other villages in other shires, that the caterpillars
iu their respective neighbourhoods, to the amount of many myriads,
had held local meetings, and unanimously passed votes of thanks to
the several bodies of vestrymen, but for whose self-sacrificing
liberality they would all, or most of them, been eaten up by then-
enemies the sparrows, of which those agricultural gentlemen had been
so wise and generous as to pay their money for the destruction.
A CREDIT TO THE NATION.
That reporter, who, the other day, announced that, at Aidershot, on
the previous Sunday, a clergyman had preached an effective sermon on
the text, "Righteousness exalteth a nation " may, or may not, have
prophesied truly. But if'that discourse had been delivered three or
four years ago, it might be thought to have so operated as to deserve
tbe epithet which the reporter applied to it in advance. Witness the
subjoined extract from the Times:—
Conscience Uoney.—The money remitted in a year to the Chancellor
of the Exchequer " by sundry persons for conscience sake" (as the Finan&
Accounts phrase it) is decreasing in amount. In the financial year 1867-68 it
was £4,688; in 1868-69 it declined to £4,194, in 1869-70 it has been only
£3,933.
The reason why Conscience Money decreases in amount is obvious.
There is a decrease of occasion for its remittance. People are discon-
tinuing to evade taxation. The policy of adjusting fiscal burdens, so as
to make everybody fed a little uncomfortable, is bearing fruit. Everybody
is pleased and satisfied. Sneers at sufferers subject to Schedule D.
have reconciled them to their lot. They no longer send Conscience
Money for "Income-tax omitted," because they no longer omit to pay
their Income-tax. In short, the amount of Conscience Money
decreases, because the national conscientiousness is increasing.
Provere for Septemrer.—The Early Bird will be received with
delight by friends in town.

was sorry to observe that a vul-

A NEW HISTORY OF INVENTIONS.
To that celebrated musician, Dr. Blow, is generally ascribed the
invention of one of the most useful of our wind-instruments—the hand-
bellows.
Gale, the Antiquary, has left us a spirited description of the Doctor
attending a Drawing-Room at St. James's, to present the first pair
made in England (by an ingenious Nottinghamshire mechanic, Blow
himself being a native of that county) to Queen Anne, who used them
the same afternoon at one of her tea-parties at Hampton Court, after
she had been haymaking in Bushey Park with the Great Officers of
State, and was graciously pleased to convey to the proud inventor the
expression of her unqualified satisfaction with his ingenious gift,
through Sir William Wyndham, the Secretary of State m attendance
on Her Majesty.
Horace Walpole. writing to Hannah More a day or two after
the party, winds up his gossiping letter with a promise to send her
"this newfangled prettiness which is now all the rage," as soon as he
can get a pair from the manufacturer in Air Street, who, he says, is
overwhelmed with orders from all parts of the kingdom and the Channel
The learned Dr. Farmer, one of the original writers in the Pharma-
copoeia, in a Ions letter to a retired needle-maker at Harrow-on-the-Hill,
explains very minutely the construction of a new and improved Sowing-
Machine, which, after a great deal of drilling, he had at last taught his
tenants to use with an average amount of success. (Consult the
archives of the Pharmaceutical Society.)
He then goes on to say, quoting that elegant Latin writer, M. T.
Cantnus, " Nihil novum est sub ipso sole ;" and, in proof ot his assertion,
cites a passage from Piers Ploughman, showing that a machine almost
identical with the one he had been describing was exhibited at the first
Agricultural Show ever held in Cornwall, at the expiration of the time
originally proposed.
It was Columrus who discovered canaries at sunrise on the morrow
of St. Martin, in the lovely islands in the Platonic Ocean which derive
their name from these favourite little warblers. Those he bronght home
with him round Cape Horn he presented, along with a magnificent
Genoa cake, to the children of Paul and Virginia of Spain, who be-
stowed on him the Order—so rarely given to any but crowned heads—
of the Moulting Phoenix. Columrus was wearing the insignia of this
Order—a feather in his cap—when Raleigh met him in Birdcage Walk
on the Queen's Birthday, and settled the plan of that famous joint
expedition to Cayenne which put doubloons into their pockets, and
pepper in the casters of all Christendom.
Lately, when viewing the Horse Show from a private horse-box, the
question suggested itself, when and by whom were horse-shoes first
invented P They are not mentioned by the writers of antiquity—not
even in The Knights of Aristophanes. The Equestrian Order at
Rome did not use them. They were unknown to the Venetians. The
tradition that the Wandering Jew picked one up in a fit of desperation
on the shores of the iEgean, rests on insufficient foundation, and bat
long been abandoned by all thorough-bred authorities. Pieces of metal
of the same shape were affixed to their front doors, as a charm against
the evil eye and rheumatism, by the Montagues and CapuMs; but the
Harmonious Blacksmith bad not then been composed, and the Horse
Artillery was still in its infancy.
The most improbable theory is, that they were introduced into
Europe, following the course of the Danube, about the time of the
Revival of Learning, and were gradually adopted by the nations whose
position on the Turf was improved by the fall of the Western Empire.
(See Horsley, passim.)
In the Museums of Constantinople, South Kensington, and the
Swiss Republic, there is not a single shoe which can be traced farther
back than the time of the Chevalier Bayard, for whose historical
charger, Black Bess, Benvenuto Cellini, by command of Leo the
Tenth, executed an exquisite set in damascened aluminium, which were
unfortunately lost in the "Battle of the Spurs."

Circus, and when he's shed his coat—which he's doing now, only the
paint was laid on with a whitewash brash—we shall see the celebrated
spotted Gee of my early childhood.
He can go up-stairs, from top to bottom; up the middle and down
again; carpet, wood, or stone, all one to him. He can ring a bell, sit
on his haunches, ana take his grab off a plate, dance a lively measure,
and fire a pistol.
"Now, Your Washup," as I say to the Crown Cockalorum, "what
more can you want in a charger P" He, the Crown C, asked me to
point out to him the advantages.
"Walk up, Hereditary Grand," says I; "just a goin' to begin.
Where's your Light-hearted Soldier occasionally quartered P Where's
the home of this gay .Militaire when on the march P Where's the
stable for the careering Gee P Why, anywhere: if on a ground floor.
But has Your Own ever been without a shelter for himself and his
amblingP Never. Why? Because the learned Gee, Sir, walks
straight on end up-stain to the attics, and there we are. He rings the
bell for what he wants. He is ready with his pistol against the
unfriendly Cockalorums; and, taking him for the whole oiling, we
shan't look upon such a first-rate Gee as my ambling for some con-
siderable time." The Hereditary cleaned his eye at me, as the Lively
Unfriendly says, and smole. There are some tunes played by the
military bands to which, when very strong in the brass, he can't help
dancing and waltzing. But I forgive him, considering the provoca-
tion, and recollecting that it was probably a German Band that went
with his Circus in happier times.
We hear the Parisians are on the scoop. I say, what did Your
Own tell you P Warn't it the correct tip, eh, last week P Don't say
no, if you'd rather not. "1 'm all there when the bell rings," says the
Duchess. "You were right," says Sinotmarinot to me. "Or any
other Cockalorum," says 1, finishing the quotation; but 1 'm dead nuts
on prophecies, and if 1 'd only backed my own opinion, it isn't on a I
careering Gee I'd be in a foreign land, far away from the ancestral
digging, bat a noble Marquis in marble halls, and all sorts o' games
going on.
But where are we now P Excuse your Light-hearted Militaire, but
sometimes he does feel damp, and a pick-me-up or a B. and S. is his
only joy. I wish my creditors were all Frenchmen at this moment.
I 'd be quite the Prooshan Officer, and make 'em come to terms. But
they won't. •
• •••••••
To enliven the evenings, I have, at the request of the Hereditary and
the Crown, commenced a novel—quite the Literary Dustman—which
I shall call The Dook and the Duchess. There's been nothing down
the road in the way of military novels for some time, and this child of
the regiment might coin. Couldn't you swagger a bit? Advertise-
ments, you know. "No noble Marquis's library complete without
The Dook and the Duchess." "New Novel by our own Cockalorum."
"The Dook and the Duchess: the Three Thousandth Edition just out.
Give your Orders, gents; the Waiter's in the Room."
"Cockalorum's New Work. Your attention to a Novel, if you
i please. Our Own Light-hearted Soldier will oblige."
| Jost paste these about, will you P and send me some staff to go on
with.
It shall be done. Bat to return to our sheeps.
• •••••
I don't care what it is. But Your Own is despondent. What with
hard lines, over-work, and bad weather, this gay Militaire ain't quite that
Spring chicken he was at the beginning of the Campaign. Sometimes
Your Own wishes he was back in the little village, swaggering up the
steps of the "Rag"and ordering dinner for two with other light-
hearted Cockalorums. Bat it won't do. The last time this cheerful
Hussar was about that quarter his boots creaked a trifle too muoh to
be pleasant. "Here he is a-coming!" said the lively Duns when
they heard the spotless varnished round the corner of Jermyn Street,
and they'd have been down on me like mud oat of a shovel.
Bombs bursting, shells flying, and the Hereditary just sent in to ask
me to split a B. and S. with him. I'm all there when the bellj rings.
And so, my Lord and Marquis, adoo, adoo! Yours
, Dyngwell.

Blue-bottle.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.
THE CI.UB.VISITa THE QUEEN OF HOLLAND

"La Seine est-elle chez elle P" asks Gooch in his usual momentary
obliviousness of his native tongue, adding his translation: "The
Queen, is she at home P"
Jomp believes that the Queen of Holland is at home. He has
been all the morning making inquiries, and the above represents the
result. Gooch thinks that, under such circumstances, "to call would
'ie an intrusion." He emphasises " call," as if ours was going to be a
visit of friends who had been hospitably asked to come in a general way
when they liked, and who had (as is invariably the case) taken advan-
tage of the invitation at the most inopportune moment.
Pooh!" says Bund, fresh from Murray, "it's the regular thing
to see."
Muntley, Finton, and Gooch, the Opposition, object to it solely
on the grounds that, being the regular thing, it is so British-touristy
and snobbish.
Maullie, who has been spending his morning in two private collec-
tions which he found out for himself without Jomp, votes for the Palace,
with a view to probable pictures.
The Commodore has the casting vote, the Opposition gives in, and
Bund, relying upon Murray, decides upon the visit of inspection.
"Not in that hat!" Gooch implores Maullie. "Not in that hat
—to the Palace!"
Maullie, who has something of the rigid obstinacy of the Puritan
in him, combined with his taste for simplicity in dress, replies that he
doesn't intend to ehange it until he comes to Brussels—" when," he
adds, " I will astonish you in my Sunday best. I have," continues
Maullie, proudly, "an Opera hat."
"French P" asks Gooch, anxiously, "silk, glossy, that you can wear
in the day-time f"
To which Maullie replies that Gooch will see. As Maullie gets
jnto the carriage, I hear Gooch telling his friends, soito voce, " II a un
rhapeau—he has a hat."
You are sure," asks Bund of Jomp, "that the Palace is open at
fourP"
"O yes." answers Jomp, expressing by his manner that he is utterly
astonished at Bund's doubting his accuracy even for a second. "O
yes—um—um—um—it is open at four. O yes!"
We drive through an avenue—very pretty this—and enter the court-
yard of the Palace. A pair-horse carriage, and a Victoria, are waiting.
Some servants in Royal liveries are chatting with other servants (belong-
mg to the aforesaid carriages) at the door.
Some one's making a call," observes Gooch, pulling up his wrist-
bands, and settling his hat, under the impression, apparently, that the
Queen may be looking out of the window, and might be induced, by his
distinguished appearance, to ask him in (not us, of course, and certainly
not Maullie, except, on sufferance in the character of 'any friend of
yours, Monsieur Gooch, of course," &c.), perhaps to dinner.
"It doesn't look like sight-seeing time," says Maullie. Even Ae is a
little oppressed by the proximity to Royalty, and makes a concession to
I propriety by cramming his sketch-book into his pocket, and pulling his
• tie down under his coat, its tendency during a drive generally being
to " ruck up " and obliterate his shirt-collar.
Bund bashfully produces black kid gloves, bat as they have weathered
several storms of rain, and the middle fingers are arranged on venti-
lating principles, this addition to his costume only induces Gooch to
I say, in a rapid under-tone, as we draw up at the portico, "Do put those
things in your pocket, or you '11 look like a respectable begging-letter
writer." He casts his eyes up to the front windows, to see if, by any
chance, the Queen is looking: bat no one is visible.
Jomp, in his Boomp-je hat and livery, unintelligible to the servants,
commands instant respeot: at first.
Two servants in gorgeous coats and knee-breeches, six foot high each
of them, let down the steps, and open the door.
A bell is rung.
[nstantly we see the ball within lined on either side by tall servants,
all in the same sort of costume, and standing bolt upright like
theatrical nobles at a shilling a night in an opera chorus
Muntley in the rumble leans over and says, "Isn't it just as if
they were going to say, ' Hail to the something or other,' eh P
Gooch silences him with a frown. We are all seated in the carriage,
I not liking to get out, as no one| is certain what may happen next, and
I there is among us a latent, undefined feeling that the Queen is coming
to receive us.
"There's some mistake somewhere," murmurs Bund, who has got
his gloves out again, as if the display of these would set right any mis-
apprehension as to our being noblemen—"In disguise," adds
i Gooch, looking first at Majtllir's hat, then at Buitd'r gloves.
Jomp is wholly incompetent, and utterly flabbergasted by the
situation. He stands helplessly by the steps, staring at the tall men
in liveries, but has nothing to say. Another five minutes like this
would send Jomp to a lunatic asylum, where he'd be shown as the
"Idiot Courier" for the remainder of his life.
Two bells more. "Like on board a ship," says the Commodore,
faintly, wishing he was at home with his violoncello.
In answer to ithese two bells appear two footmen in more resplendent
liveries than the others, and about two inches taller.
They walk down to the door, and take their places, as if by clock-
work arrangement or previous rehearsal, by the door. They don't
notice us, except by a glance, having evidently enough to do to attend
to their own deportment at the present juncture.
Another bell, this time more distant, as if some way down a passage;
a slight delay, and then one grander and more gorgeous footman, a sort
of Swiss from a cathedral, topping by an inch all the rest, walks slowly
forward, and approaches our carriage. He waits by the steps, inviting
us (in Dutch we fancy) to descend. The Swiss gracefully removes his
hat. The two by the door having a second before put on their hats,
now politely, but stiffly, take them off. We all take oars off, and
that part of the ceremony, whatever it means, is over.
Bund addresses Jomp. "Ask," he says, "if the Queen is in, and
whether we can see the palace P"
In such Dutch as he can manage, Jomp inquires as to Royalty
being at home. The Giant looking down with some curiosity on
Jomp, does not comprehend the question at first. Then on Jomp
trying it again, he grasps it.
Yes, the Queen U at home. We will descend, of course.
Now comes a ticklish point. We have to explain that we want to
see—not the Queen, but the palace. The Swiss cannot understand.
"The Queen is waiting to receive us," he explains through Jomp, who
gives us a very vague translation. Finding that we don't move
("There'1l be a row," cries Gooch in'despair, "and letters in the
Times about Cockney Tourists. Let's go back "), and being tired of
standing with his hat off (all the other lesser giants being fatigued too),
he pulls a small door-bell, which is responded to by a little wizened
man in black, like the shade of a departed butler. (" Good effect
among all the liveries," says Maullie under his breath, making a
mental note of it.) N.B. He has subsequently put the whole thing
into a picture full of halls in perspective, grandly costumed nobles
with flambeaux in their hands, and a secretary iu black. He calls it
Reception of the Dutch Republican Ambassadors at the Court of the
King of Spain. All our likenesses are there, and it has been on his
easel some considerable time. Everybody says it's a very fine picture,
but nobody has bought it, as yet.)
The Butler's Ghost receives some information from the Chief Giant.
He glides towards us along the carpeted hall noiselessly. He is at
our carriage-door. He salutes Bund, fixing upon him instinctively as
the Commander, and ignoring Jomp altogether.
"Her Majesty," he says, "is within. Your Excellency—-". We

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
look at one another. In an instant the Butler's Ghost sees a mistake
somewhere. Bund takes the opportunity, and informs him that we
wish to see the Palace.
The vision of greatness is dispelled. At a word from the Butler's
Ghost, three of the Giants replace their hats on their heads super-
ciliously, and disappear. After them disappear, in perfect order, and
without any show of confusion, their hatless but equally gorgeous
brethren-in-livery. Then we are all alone with the Shade and one
giant, the tallest. It is explained to us: this is the time for private
receptions. Not the time, ob, dear, no, for seeing the Palace. Up to
four o'clock the Palace is open to sightseers, but after that closed.
Everyone here knows that. Jomp wishes to make a personal explana-
tion, but is called to order, and stands by the carriage-door, dis-
comfited.
Butler's Ghost declares that, the Queen being at home, sight-seeing
is impossible—utterly out of the question. Bund outs it to him that we
are going very early to-morrow, that he (Buns) has only to call on his
friend the Ambassador that moment, and he would return (in effect)
with orders to see every room in the Palace, from the attics to the
cellar. That he (Bund) and party are most distinguished people,
representing Literature, Science, aud Art (Science being, perhaps,
Mumtley and Finton in the rumble, who have been hitherto taken
for our valets), and; that, to sum up, if the Butler's Ghost will only
break through rules, and show the Palace, the Butler's Ghost shall
find that we will make it well worth his while;" and therewith Bund,
having craftily got a large coin of the realm out of his waistcoat pocket,
presses it upon the little man's acceptance, much to Gooch V horror,
who exclaims, "I say! Hang it! You might as well tip the Lord
Chamrerlain at home," evidently under the impression kthat the
Butler's Shade holds that office.
The lip has its effect. The Butler's Shade take* the giant into hie
confidence, shares (probably) with him, or make* arrangements for
future sharing, and finally announces to us, after disappearing into and
reappearing (for mere form's sake, I am sure) from, a dark passage,
that the Queen has graciously permitted us to see the Palace.
I don't believe the Butler's Ghost ever went near the Queen. This
is strongly borne out by his subsequent conduct.
He shows us through the rooms hurriedly, and as quickly as pos-
sible, as if he was doing something wrong. He stops now and then to
describe, but his descriptions are abbreviated, and his eye wanders from
one door to another as if to intimate at the shortest notice that, as the
Pantaloon says to the Clown when he's stealing sausages, There's
"somebody coming!" We 're all, so to speak, stealing sausages, as
Clowns, and he's the Pantaloon.
We enter a drawing-room beautifully and curiously furnished with
Japanese hangings and coverings. Jump, who follows in our wake,
and who has been rather snuffed out by our wizened little cicerone
here explains to us that " Dese come from Japan," but on receiving a
severe reproving look from the Butler's Ghost, he retires into himself
(he can't go very far, I should say, on such a journey), and is satisfied
with corroborating with gloomy nods the various points of our cice-
rone's information.
"Hush!" says the little man, suddenly'stooping down, and looking
through a keyhole.
We now discover that we are hunting the unfortunate Queen from
room to room. Royalty flees before us. Royalty, for what we know,
may be concealed behind a screen or a window-curtain, as we pass. A
sort of hide-and-seek. The Guide ascertains, as far as he can by the
aid of the keyhole, that the Queen is not in her boudoir, and we enter.
Evidently she has not long left it. There is her book open, and music
on the piano.
A servant, in livery, suddenly appearing, motions to Butler's Ghost
to pause before rashly visiting the next apartment. "It's too bad,"
says Gooch. "Hush!" says our mysterious attendant. We halt,
looking dubiously at one another, and then, on a sign from our leader,
who has again satisfied himself through the keyhole, we proceed
stealthily, like conspirators in an operr. We only want daggers, to
complete the resemblance. But our sticks and umbrellas have been
left in the carriage.
We talk, when we do talk, under our breath. We hurriedly admire
furniture and imitation bas-reliefs on the wall. We wonder at paintings
on the ceiling, and we are hurried on to the ball-room, where, it being
a very large place and only used on State occasions, we, as it were,
breathe again.
The breathing time is very short, however, and we are once more
hnrried along a passage, then a corridor, where more pictures are ex-
plained to us, in a sort ot pattcr-song, as last as ever it can be given, by
the Butler's Ghost, who, evidently very much to his own satisfaction,
brings us out on a landing which leads by the back stairs and servants
offices to the front ball, and so we are smuggled ignominiously out of
the building, and into our carriage.
Here we resume our dignity, and largesse is bestowed by Jump (on
our behalf, but we ignore the process, as not dealing in such dirty
matters) upon our Guide and the tall Swiss.
Then we are driven through some lovely avenues, where all the
peasants take off their hats to us (" They think we 're the Queen, or
something," says Gooch, much pleased), and at last we reach the hotel.
"Veil," says Jomp, perfectly satisfied with his arrangements, "you
'ave peen the Palace." And so we have; and agree that we won't see
another in the land of Boomp-je.
"Dere is not another," says Jomp, which settles the matter at once.
GLEN-(BATTLE).FIELD STARCH.
"Whin you ask for Berlin, see that you get it, as another capital
may be substituted as the 'capture." Mutatis mutandis, most readers
will recollect something like this as a perpetual advertisement. Mr.
Punch has been amused to see the proprietor of the article advertised
has actually issued a War Map (really a pretty little one), and where
the title should be is the above recommendation, in its original form.
The appropriateness of Starch on a battle-field was not clear to Mr.
Punch until he remembered that, by taking the slightest liberty with
Sir W altk k Scott (a thing that beautifully tempered man would have
smiled at), Staroh— scientifically called A mi don, might be introduced
nobly. Remember the end of Bannockburn, in the Lord of the Isles:—
"Eaoh heart had caught the patriot spark,
Old rami and stripling, priest and clerk,
Bondsman and serf; even female hand
Stretched to the hatcew't or the brand;
But, when mute Amidon they heard
tine to their zeal bis signal word,
A frenzy fired the throng"
and the English came to grief.
[N.B. We expect to have all our collars starched gratis, henceforth,
until the good days shall come when those abominations shall cease
from out the laud, and nothing shall hurt the British neck unless its
owner forgets the British law.]
SENSIBLE SUFFOLK.
The inhabitants of "Silly Suffolk" will deserve to have their
county coupled with a teas obnoxious epithet, if they act up to the
letter of the sensible advice, which lately has been given to them by
their Lord Lieutenant:—
"Beooars and Vagrants.—Notice.—Wherever begging and vagrancy
are greatly on the increase in this county, and indiscriminate almsgiving is
believed to be the main cause of this evil, the publio are strongly urged to
abstain from giving to beggars or vagrants, of whose circumstances they can
know nothing; but are requested to hand such persons over to a policeman or
parish constable, who, after due inquiry, will either take them before a
Magistrate, or see that they are temporarily relieved in a proper manner."
Idleness, say the copy-books, is the root of evil: and indiscriminate
almsgiving very greatly aids the growth and cultivation of this noxious
root. As one of the best cultured of our agricultural counties, Suffolk
has no ground to spare for such a kind of root-crop. Beggars who
encumber the land whereon they live should be hoed out, or be toed
out, with all possible despatch. If Suffolk, wisely acting on the hint
of its chief constable, leaves its police to deal with tbe vagrants that
infest it, Silly Suffolk will be setting such a sensible example as all the
other counties would do well forthwith to imitate.
The Worst Gang Going.
If e'er there was gang
That deserves to go hang,
In France's debacle of fate,
"l'is the Paris Press-Gang,
That scream slander and slang.
And lie, with the foe at the gate!
Shaftesbury's Characteristics.
At Ryde, the other day, in a speech on behalf of the City Mission,
Lord Shaftesrury stated his belief that "the next census would
show a population in London of nearly four millions, a Serious propor-
tion of whom were in a state of social and moral degradation so great
that, in his opinion, unless something were done to improve them, the
British Constitution would not be worth a quarter of a century's pur-
chase." Goodness gracious! Who ever expected to hear such a
statement concerning "serious" people from the Earl of Shaptes-
rury P
"here (may) re truths."
One change in the French Ministry will be approved by all. As
Director of Telegraphs we have M. Steinwackrrs, vice M. Tell-
w hackers.

or if it can't, no matter. Think of the mothers and babies crouching
in the cellars of Strasbourg, to be out of the way of shells, and perhaps
other mothers rushing down among them with .babies killed in their
arms!
Mr. Theydon. Don't make yourself ill again, dear. Perhaps no sucb

Mrs. Theydon. Don't talk in that way, Charles. You don't mean it.
You were nearly killed yourself the other day in saving the child that
fell down crossing the street, among the horses.
Mr. Theydon. Well, don't throw my folly in my face. If I had been
killed I wonder what you'd have said about saving a ragged brat that,
was nothing to me, while I had children of my own at home. And I
should have deserved it, too.
Mrs. Theydon. That has nothing to do with the War.

MORE RIGHTS FOR WOMEN.
The following proposals of legislature on the Rights of Women
will, it is understood, be discussed at the Social Science Congress as
soon as it meets:—
■ L The Establishment of a female Parliament, with a House of
Ladies, for the purpose of making and revising all laws which c°ncep
women. The strong-minded woman by whom this subject will be
introduced will not fail to suggest that in each of the Houses of the
Women's Parliament there shall be a Gentleman's Gallery.
2. The immediate enactment of a statute which shall render women
liable to serve on juries, so as to place them oa an.equality with men
as to the privilege of being tried by their peers.
A JOKE FOR GARIBALDI.
It is whispered on 'Change that the German success will probably be
a Nice thing for Italy, with Savoy to Boot.
ORDINARY OCCURRENCES.
Lord Gormandale, on the 31st ult., gave a pleasant pic-nic in his
Lordship's grounds, at Grubwood. By way of novelty, an ox was
roasted whole.
A hen, belonging to Mr. Sprout, maltster, a short time ago, laid a
single egg, of rather unusual magnitude. Yesterday, a brood of six
chickens chipped the shell. Both the little birds and their mother are
doing uncommonly well.
Sir Foncer Bullfinch, out shooting on the first of September, at
Bramshaw, fired, as he supposed, at a hare in cover, and shot a fox.
Although the act was purely accidental, the misfortune of having been
the author, even by inadvertence, of vulpicide so preyed on the Hon.
Baronet's mind, that he took to his bed, and did not leave it till yester-
day, having in the mean time, received from the members of the Horsey
Hunt their unanimous condolence, and exoneration from all censure.
A black-and-tan mouse was killed on Tuesday last, by a small terrier
of the same colour, at the flour-mill of Messrs. Hopper.
We have this week to record a somewhat singular case of treasure-
trove. In sawing through the trunk of an elm-tree, the base of which
was destined to form a chopping-block for the use of Mr. Bluerell,
butcher, of Bousfield, the workmen employed at Mr. Chipps's timber-
yard found their implement impeded by a hard substance, which
turned out to be a halfpenny piece, of the reign of his Majesty,
George the Third, lodged in the centre of the tree. How it got
there nobody knows.
A popular dance-tune received a droll illustration on Friday morn-
ing. A weasel, pursued by a poodle-dog, made for refuge to the shop
of Mr. Glores, pawnbroker, where it ascended the spout.
A Swan with two necks has appeared in the river at Stratford-on-
Avon. Several persons have endeavoured to shoot it, but without
effect.
The rhinoceros in Mr. Lyons's menagerie last night presented the
elephant with a fine foal. This is the first instance on record of a
pachydermatous hybrid, which, should it fortunately survive, will
doubtless prove no small attraction to zoologists.
Criesland Thiers.

O Friends, don't " Blub " without a reason:
_ Let flags, not mouchoirs, be in sight—

Dear Old Soul!
Mrs. Ramsrotham is much offended at an observation in one of the
papers about the Serpentine mud. She read that though this had been
removed to dry, more than a year had passed, and " the mess was not
yet Friable." She cannot express her disgust at the idea of frying
such a thing.

A PEOTEST AT BICESTER.
Bicester has long been famous, on account of the extraordinary
occurrence which has been commemorated by one of our poets:—
There was an old Tailor of Bicester,
He went out to walk with his sister,
When a bird called a Jay
Took the lady away,
Before the old gentleman missed her.
In this poem, one of the choicest of its class, is preserved the memory
of a kindly, but careless individual of the sartorial persuasion, who
good-naturedly took his relative for a walk, but omitted to pay her
enough attention to prevent her falling a victim to ornithological cupi-
dity. Some commentators think that the Cupidity refers to Cupid, and
that the Jay was a gaily-attired chattering young officer, whose uniform
and rattle fascinated the sister. But this interpretation savours of the
teaching of a school already too potent, and we prefer to hold by the
text.
All this, however, has nothing whatever to do with what we are
Soing to say, except that we have to mention Bicester. We merely
esired by means of our quotation to invite attention to a passage in a
Seech just delivered in the above town, by the Right Hon. Joseph
en ley, whose sentiments- malgri his honest Toryism—are always
sensible, healthy, and English. Said Mr. Henley :—
"Gentlemen, it is no matter whether it is gospel or not to talk about it,
but everybody here and everywhere talks and thinks about the War, ana
nothing but the War; and I am sure at the present moment, living as we do
in an age when Europe boasts itself to be learned, scientific, civilised, and
above all other professions to be Christian, it is a terrible thing to see, as we
have done within these past two months, how the very matters that were con-
trived for the comfort of mankind have enabled nations to bring together
suddenly immense masses of men, and employ the weapons which the skill of
nations has provided to slaughter those men in a manner that is hardly
credible did we not know it was ho."
There! People may observe, cynically, that it is of no use to say such
things. Perhaps it is not of much use, but it is fit that protest against
this infernal war should be incessant, and it has been well made in the
above simple straightforward language of one of the truest of English
gentlemen. It were well if officialism would condescend to say some-
thing of the same kind, in the name of this nation.
A NEW TERROR IN WAR.
We have no desire to dwell on painful matters, bat a friend of oi m
sends us this (from the Pall Mall Gazette) begging that we will de-
nounce it as the most brutal thing that has been said during the War :—
"When it was necessary to sign oertain documents in connection with the
capitulation, no generals could be found. The Prussian Commandant re-
marked, ' Gentlemen, I cannot do everything; your generals know the di ities
imposed on them by the situation, but your generals are always asleep. It
appear* to me that, under the circumttances, they might get up at six i n the
morning'" • r
Our friend who, when energetic gets up at 11'30, wants us to preach
a sermon on the cruelty which is taught men by war, but we ( ;ontent
ourselves with leaving the tale in its nude and appalling shape.
The Pipe and the NeecUe-Gun.
The consumption of cigars and other tobacco by ''be German army
is enormous. What has the Anti-Tobacco Society t° say to it P Con-
sidering what shots the Germans are with their arir-is of precision, one
may observe that their fire is fully iequal to their sd 'eke.

EXIT IMPERATOR!
Akother turn of Fortune's wheel,
That lifts so high, that lays so low;
Of Life's strange cards another deal,
Of Destiny's dark dice a throw:
But turn or deal or cast,
Methinks, the last!
Has he not lived his life P A life
None ever lived before he came.
There is a time to quit the strife,
To throw one's hand up in the game.
"Jeu ne taut pas chandelle"—
He knows it well.
What if the candle's nigh burnt down,
Grows smoky, guttering, and dim P
Life's candle-end mav cost a crown,
That end must still be saved by him.
A light thence has been lit—
He'd husband it.
That pale and sorrow-stricken lad,
Too soon baptised with tears and fire.
Why make his sad young life more sad P
Why so soon sever son and sire P
For love, though it be pain,
Let him remain.
Who knows P There may be time in store—
Short time most like, but calm and still;
To feed this mind with that life's lore,
And bend it to his well-schooled will.
Can he not teach, and muse,
'i the news P
At least, he challenged Death in fight;
Death, that smote many, passed him by:
Coward P When was crowned head judged right P
There's choice outside of " fight" or "die."
Yes—he will live, and yield,
And void the field.
Perhaps he always knew, or thought,
That it would come to this at last,
Whene'er to test of blows were brought
Truth's marble and sham's plaster-cut.
He knew, the ware that sold,
Where 'twould not hold.
Does not the workman shape his tools,
Or choose the tools his work that fit P
While his task needed knaves and fools,
The knaves and fooU were there for it.
But hard war put him out,
And them, no doubt.
Was he the monster Hugo sung P
All dead in him but lust and lie—
Cartouche, his bandit troop among,
Who counts blood-gains in orgie sly,
Jove-Scapin, Grand Monarque Macaire,—
Was't true or fair P
Caricature—how large so'er
The outline, masterly the hand;
Strong colour, yes: hate's hues may glare,
But truth's white light are weak to stand,
And this was not the man
Of Hugo's plan.
Mixed warp and woof in him, as all:
And in this miserable hour,
Soft thoughts come up to break his fall
So low, from such a height of power.
In Man and Emperor both
Some good found growth.
The bounds, perhaps, of false and true
In that dark mind were blurred and worn,
Maybe, the clear air he ne'er drew,
That comes up with Truth's radiant:
Right and wrong fought in him
A battle dim.
Bat wrong not always conquered, more
Than right could always wrong defeat:
Fair face still to our land he wore,
Nor e'er foul blow proved fair face cheat.
The false man Hugo drew
To m was true.
But not for pity can we turn
To wish him up out of the dust;
France has done well aside to spurn,
The rotten stay she sinned to trust.
Whom the time's need proves weak,
Unloved, must break.
However good and ill might cross
And, blending, blur themselves in him,
To draw men round him was his loss,
Who were all dark when he had dim—
The most base most his friend:
And this the end!
But shall this pack that yelps and howls,
Jackal-like at his flying wheels,
Pays off base smiles with baser scowls,
And, as it slavered, snaps his heels—
Shall they the hand assail
That made them quail f
Let those in France that scorned his sun,
Lift mouths to hoot him into shade.
Not those whose swift steps vied to run,
With necks low for his footstool laid:
But those who would not bow,
Should buffet now!
If of mixed metal he was wrought,
France, that obeyed him, what is she P
After he struck, her votes he sought;
Twice to his yoke she bowed the knee.
But Paris held aloof—
Lo now, the Proof!
A bat! with whom, but with VEmpereur.
Vive! what P What but la Rdpublique.
A day—an hour! Lajoicfait peur—
Shout, though it be with tongue in cheek!
What was up is pulled down—
Smash Bees and Crown I
Whirl, Paris, round from pole to pole;
Kiss, curse, laugh, cry, rave, dance and sing,
Forget the Prussians and their goal;
Give Revolution sweep and swing;
Up with Left! Down with Right!
To-morrow fight.
As yesterday so runs to-day—
Swift change, light mood, and whirling will;
Abiding never in one stay,
And still be-fooled, and trusting still;
While the foe at thy g^ate
Strikes swift and straight.
Robbery-Bobbery.
Rascaldom finds time to invent new phrases for old rogueries.
Putting water into the milk can, in lieu of more valuable liquid pre-
viously stolen, is now called "Bobbing the Milk." "It is the custom,"
muttered a milk-thief who came last week under the unfavourable
notice of a Beak. Could not Bobby do something against Bobbing P
We might give him a Lactometer, and bid him use it during his early
lounge. If it revealed adulteration, let him avenge the milk-can by a
dig in the bread-basket. This would be a good specimen of provisional
Government.
Lying (not) like Truth.

POETA NASCITUE.
Since the beginning of the war, (and that is leas than a month—
—from Sasrbruck to Sedan) Mr. Punch has received war-poems
enongh to make a new Iliad. He has sternly refused to publish any of
these. But the genuine inspiration and exqnisite diction of the follow-
ing masterpiece, (its acrostic character introducing a playful element,)
seem to warrant him in publishing it, the rather that it is much better
than the vast majority of the efforts of his volunteer Correspondents:—

[An appropriate locality, by the bye, for it was St. Martin who tore
his cloak in halves and gave half to a sick man.]
HOHENZOLLERNS AND HARD NAMES.
M. Edmond Arout, in the Soir, calls the Germans "Teutonic
vermin," and says that "France must sweep away the Hohe>zol-
lerns and their feudal followers" by next New Year's Day. This
talk is homogeneous with the caricature which represented the King of
Prussia's troops as mice marcbing upon a cheese; but if the Germans
are mice, what are the people who sing " Rataplan" but other mice P
We will not say "rats, for more reasons than one; an intention to
pun might be imputed to us by some of our correspondents who send
us puns of their own. How would M. Arout represent Hohenzol-
lerns if he were to draw them in the shape of vermin P Perhaps he
would delineate the typical Hohenzollern as a cockroach, or some
beetle. The "Teutonic vermin," however, would be
extraon
more aptly depicted as hornets brought by M. Arout's countrymen
themselves about their own ears.
CERTAINLY NOT.'
Never before has Mr. Punch had to complain of his delightful and
instructive Contemporary, Notes and Queries. But look here :—
"What U wanted is a dictionary which shall trace back every English
word or group of words to the Earliest Radical in existence." -
This is too bad. The Earliest Radical! Dr. Johnson (not in his
dictionary) has explained the Earliest Radicalism, which he called
Whiggery. But we do not want our whole language traced to that
source. Enough that a Frenchman has called it diabolical."

It is the old, old story!
Athirst they were for glory,
Obtained by battle gory,
They therefore chose their Chief.
Now he has come to grief
They abase him like a thief;
Denounce him and disown him.
Dismiss him and dethrone him,
In effigy stab and stone him
In whom they had vain belief.
They are a noble nation,
(To quote an observation)
And now, by tribulation,
May they at last be schooled;
Their martial passion cooled:
May they be wisely ruled,
Return to peaceful labours;
With Chassepots and with sabres
Ne'er more assail their neighbours,
And be no more befooled.
Untaught by their example
Of retribution ample,
Should bullies, fain to trample
An equal, climb his wall
Without a cause or call,
May those invaders fall!
Mere glory if fools pursue in
Fell war, reap they their due in
Fit ridicule and ruin:
Confound such numskulls all!
A Probable Papism.
What will the Pope say when his temporal dominion is
confined to the " Leonine City P" Perhaps he will com-
pare himself to Daniel in the Lions' Den.

"WHO KNOW HOW TO DIE."
I |Mr. Punch, who means to read his friend Mr. Carlyle's Thirty
Volumes every year (especially now that the Thirty «ill present them-
selves in a readable type, and with the author's latest annotations), came
la9t night upon the famous passage about the Hymn composed in 1792,
for the Six Hundred of Marseilles " who knew how to die." He—Mr.
Punch—is tired of seeing it said that "History repeats itoelf," though
the fact be so. But as France is invaded, and by other than a Bruns-
wick who was shaking himself (s'ibrante) at Coblentz, and who was
subsequently saved the trouble of performing that act for himself, and
as the Hymn has been a good deal heard of lately, Mr. Punch tran-
scribes the celebrated Carlylean lines :—
"The Thought which works noiseless in this black browed mass, an inspired
Tyrta-in Colonel, BouoiT de Lillf, whom the earth still held in 1836, has
translated into grim melody and rhythm: into his Hymn, or March of the
Marseilles*, luckiest musical composition ever promulgated. The sound of
which will make the blood tingle in men's veins, and whole Annies and
Assemblages will sing it, with eyes weeping and burning, with hearts defiant
of Death, Despot, and Devil."
The Hymn has again resounded all over France—and has even been
profaned by theatrical singers who, with rouged faces and melodramatic
gestures, shout or squall it at boxes, pit, and gallery. And many
others have sung it very loudly who will probably sing very small when
the hour of fighting comes. But the fierce Hymn, like Julius Cesar,
is "mighty yet." The only thing is that circumstances have changed,
and that one of the three enemies [whom hearts in '92 burned to defy,
exists not for France. And it is due to Frenchmen to say that
they have never been much—perhaps never sufficiently afraid of the
other two. But it is a noteworthy thing that eighty years—a revolu-
tion of Saturn—have brought round the old time again, and that the
history of the present hour in France may be read in the splendid page
of Thomas Cajllyle.

OUR IGNOBLE INSULARITY.
When Europe is satisfied, England is tranquil.
WORD-PAINTERS AT THE WARS.
| Our Own Correspondents at the seat of war, some of them, have got
themselves into trouble, having been arrested because they were
mistaken for spies. To secure them against any such misfortunes for
the future, by rendering the nature of their mission obvious to all
beholders, it might be advisable that they should wear some distinctive
badge or costume. The representative of each newspaper could go
about with the broadsheet of his particular journal affixed to his
shoulders, or walk in a sort of tabard, formed by a couple of its bill-
boards. This would be a near approach to a Press uniform; perhaps
rather a too near approach to a "foolscap uniform turned up with ink,"
which would be unsuitable to the literary merit of gentlemen whose
narratives, for the most [part replete with facts of consequence,
and devoid of trivial details, are as interesting and instructive as they
are pithy and concise.
ADULTERATION AND OAKUM.
The County Bench at Shrewsbury, the other day, fined five rogues,
whom, unhappily, they had not the power to sentence to imprison-
ment and hard labour. Four of those rogues were beerhouse
keepers, who had sold beer adulterated with salt in the proportion of
from thirty to thirty-six grains to the gallon. The fifth rogue was
a grocer, convicted of selling stuff called tea mixed with iron filings.
In consequence of chemical decomposition—
All who did drink
His tea, drank ink—
a draught which does not cheer if it may be said to possess the negative
recommendation of not inebriating. The salt beer sold by the other
rogues must have had an effect greatly the reverse of cheering on those
whom it inebriated, the rather that it inflamed instead of quenching
their thirst. It is to be regretted that the wounded French and
Germans cannot have the benefit of a substitute for lint, in the form of
a very large quantity of oakum picked by those five rascals.

THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.

AT AMSTERDAM—THE BOOMPJE MOTTO—THE NEW GUIDE—AN EXCIT-
ING PROSPECT.
eems to me, after visiting
various Churches in Hol-
land, that to take off your
hat in a church is rather] a
sign of irreverence than
otherwise. As the fashion-
books would say, "Hats
are much worn in church."
At Amsterdam. — New
Grand Hotel some distance
out of the town. We have
=j it all to ourselves.
"Why," says our Com-
modore to Jomp, "we're
the only people in the hotel.
How's thatP"
We listen; expecting to
hear the cause of the con-
spicuous absence of visit-
ors, something about dull
season, or want of funds,
or whatever else may ac-
count for the emptiness of
a Grand Hotel. We look for
this, seeing that Jomp has
been half an hour in the
hotel, conversing down-
stairs with the proprietor
and hall-porter.
"What's the reason," asks Bund, "of our being the only people
here, ehP"
Jomp shrugs his shoulders. It is, evidently, to his mind, too absurd
to put such a question. The fact, he thinks, speaks for itself. How-
ever, he replies, "Veil—um—um—you are the only people 'ere—O
yes; because—you see—nm—um—" here he finishes thinking it out as
usual, "you see,—dere is nobody else in de place."
Maullie'. delighted. Galleries of pictures. He spends his first day
with Jan Steen, Remrrandt's Night Watch, and Van der Helst's
City Guard of Amsterdam.
It seems to me, speaking inartistically, that one doesn't understand
what portrait-painting is until these marvellous pictures have been
studied.
"Why," says Gooch, meditatively, "can't they paint groups of
portraits now-a-days, this size P"
Maullie gives as] the probable reason for there being so many
grouped portraits, and so, comparatively, few "portraits of single
gentlemen," that individually the Hollanders were not rich enough to
have a picture every man of himself to himself, and so they clubbed
together, " The artist," says Muntlet, "making a reduction on taking
a quantity."
We all visit Mr. Six's collection, and enthusiastically admire the pic-
tures of Burgomaster and Burgomistress Six, painted by Remerandt.
We drive about the'town. The whole party, except Maullie, who
prefers taking a sketch of the market-place from the carriage, visit the
largelchurch, Nieuwe Kerk (first cousin to Scotch Kirk, evidently), and
on returning therefrom we find Maullie in a great state of excite-
ment.
"Here! Hi!" he exclaims, vociferating and waving his umbrella
and sketch-book.
"Good heavens!" says Gooch, considerably scandalised, "he
needn't do that. We shall have a crowd round us again." And
dreading this, he hurries on towards the carriage.
"I say, #ou fellows!" cries Maullie, excitedly, "I've got the
motto for the Boompje Club. Look up there!"
With his umbrella he points upwards, towards the other side of the
open Place. At first we sec nothing except the tall houses closely
wedged in between one another, as if they'd come late to see a per-
formance and there was only standing-room for them.
"Don't you see P " he asks. We do see, but, clearly, not what he
wants us to, fix upon. "That inscription—there !" he urges, prodding
the umbrella upwards always in the same direction, as if he could touch
the spot to which he is drawing our attention.
There are names of shopkeepers, of trades, of houses, all in large
letters, and we, more or less incorrectly, read them. "Now," he cries,
"the next one," and Bund reads aloud an inscription, high up over
the second storey of one of the tallest houses, the letters of which are
painted in a decided undeniable black on a white ground,
"Dam No. 2."
"There!" says he, "isn't that the mottoP Isn't the Boompje
principle to take precious good
Two look out for himself P 'T
care of Number One, and let Number
We know by this time that the meaning of " Dam No. 2" is nothing
ore than, for instance, "No. 2, Portland Place," or "No. 2, Fleet
Street," but the look of the words in this aspect, and their sound when
given in the true Boompje-ish manner, recommend them at once to us
as the motto for the Boompje Club.
When we separate and return to England, each member will take
this motto back to his own house, and when in doubt," as directions
for whist have it, he will then act on the above Christian sentiment,
and be a happy and virtuous Boompje.
We won't see the Palace, but we pass through its hall in order to
ascend a tower (Maullie will go up a tower wherever there is one), in
order to see the bird's-eye view.
"Now," say» Bund, on the second day, "as Jomp never'knows any-
thing about any place, I have hired a regular Amsterdam Guide."
We applaud the Commander, and the Amsterdam Guide appears.
He is a young man with a fresh complexion, and a Hebraic nose,
dressed in a brown coat, bright check Ltrousers, yellow waistcoat, blue
tie, and a white wideawake, being the 'only living creature I ever re-
member to have seen in any way realising the coloured frontispieces of
the Music-Hail songs. If the Amsterdam Guide had suddenly thrown
himself into) an attitude, and announced himself as having been
christened " Champagne Charley" by his godfathers and godmothers,
none of us would have been more than slightly astonished.
After the following conversation^which I willjiere recount, we come
to the conclusion that he is Jomp's nephew:—
Ourselves. Is there much to see in Amsterdam P
Oxide. Plenty. Full.
Ourselves. What is there P
Guide. Veil (uncommonty like Jomp this)—"ave you zeen de Canals P
As nobody could walk two steps outside any door in Amsterdam
without seeing the canals, this'question doe* appear somewhat point-
less. We reply, naturally, that we have seen the canals.
Guide (who, to our astonishment, is rather take* aback by our answer,
pauses, and then resumes). 'Ave you zeen de snoops (shops) f
Ourselves (somewhat impatiently). Yes, we 're seen the shops.
Guide (looks round at the parly, as if we were evidently going to be one
loo many for him). Veil, den, you 'ave zeen the quays P
Bund (snappishly). Yes, of course we have.
Gooch (aside). Commeil est bete! (kindly translating.) What an ass

A BABOO ON BEAUTY.

8 you are doubtless aware, my dearest Punch,'the
other night, at the Hanover Square Rooms, a farewell soirie was given
to the Baroo Cot/nder Sen, who, having been going about here
lecturing, is about to return to Indir. You must have been amused
by reading a speech Mr. Sen made, in which after having said that
both men and women were liable to commit errors and make mistakes,
he went on to say what I now copy out of a paper:—
"There was, for instance, the Girl of the Period, (Laughter.) He hoped
that she would never make her appearance in Indis. There were two things
he particularly objected to in the ladies' dresses he saw in England. These
two things were their heads and their tails. (Roars of laughter.) With regard
to the ladies' heads, the women of England and of European countries gene-
rally seemed to have, at first sight, much longer hair than the women of
Indis. Why, then, the huge protuberance at the back of the head?"
So much for our heads; but Mr. Sen omitted to mention his objec-
tion to our tails, by which I suppose he means our skirts; but he didn't
say what he meant, which people not understanding naturally made
them burst into roars of laughter. We are not mermaids, and have no
more of a tail than a Baboo, nor so much as a Baboon. A train is the
only sort of tail that any of us ever wear, and no sensible girl, unless
her feet and ankles are exceptionally ugly, now goes about in long
dresses, so as to be draggle-tailed, but she wears short, which do not
sweep the street, and therefore, lasting all the longer, combine economy
with elegance. On the latter point perhaps Mr. Sen has his own
opinions, which may be peculiar, and he can enjoy them if he likes.
As to our heads, it may be true that chignons are rather fantastic,
and to use a man's word, grotesque; and to hide a good forehead with
ragged hair may be as great a mistake almost, as it is to wear a dress
too long; but how can one alter the fashionsP She cannot help
following them, whatever they are, so long as they last. It is quite
true;what my Uncle Wink says. We are under a necessity of doing so;
we can no longer change what is worn at the time than a cab can
change its colour. He admits it is no fault of ours. 1 have heard
him say so—his words were these :—" The persistence of women in
ridiculous or injurious modes of clothing does not prove that, as a
shallow jester has observed, they are, like facts, stubborn things. To
say it proceeds from a swinish obstinacy would be to use coarse
language in making a mis-statement; its cause is simply a vis inertia
akin to that of inanimate matter." I like men who speak with consi-
deration of women, as Uncle Wink does, and not satirical creatures
like that disagreeable Baboo. I am sure the way in which you speak
about us, my dearest Punch, is always most delightful to
Your ever sincerely enthusiastic admirer, Bella.

THE "CAPTAIN" FOUNDERED
On Wednesday, September 7, 1870.
O tidings, sad as true,
Of grief, Britannia's share,
The Captain and her crew
Gone down off Finisterre!
The finest ship we had,
The finest on the sea,
Which now, strong Ironclad,
Sweeps o'er thee!
'Twas but the other day
When we rejoiced, at length
That England had a stay
Found in that tower of strength,
That matchless turret-ship:
She crossed the salt sea foam,
Ne'er, from her trial-trip,
To come home.
Her'consorts, where she rode,
Had marked her overnight.
Returning daybreak showed
No Captain to their sight.
A floating spar her tale
Related but too well
.
The winds they had heard wail
Were her knell.
Some few survivors'told
How, from the squall's side-blow,
Her prompt Chief, when she rolled,
Cried "Topsail sheets let go!"
In vain; before the blast
She toppled, overthrown,
Sank to the bottom, fast,
Like a stone.
Down with her to the deep
Went all the wealth she cost,
A loss which would be cheap
If that were all we lost.
But with her went the brave,
Heaven rest their gallant souls!
Burgoyne beneath the wave;
Cowper Coles.
Her Architect went down,
With her his art had planned,
And he, of bright renown,
Who held her in command.
Wreck never yet so sore
This England did betide,
Such treasure ne'er before
Sea did hide.
There's iron enow to close.
The gap in England's wall.
What shall we do for those
Departed past recall P
Bereaved, we all deplore
Defenders of our coast;
But some, who miss them more,
Mourn them most.
To those we owe a debt,
The due of ample aid,
Which Britons should not let
Remain a day unpaid.
Their country now, at large,
Stands in their parents' stead:
Her bond she will discharge
To the dead.
From Our Poet.

Ultsses, aged, wise, valiant, and supported by his son, the brave and
good Telemachus, is driven to make war upon those who in his
absence, had invaded his home. His arms are blessed with conquest,
and the chiefs who were his enemies have fallen. But their followers
maintain the strife, instead of submitting, and the old King and the
young Prince resolve on further vengeance. All goes down before
them, and
"Before the Father and the conquering Son
Heaps rush on heaps, they fight, they drop, they tun.
Now by the sword, and now the javelin, fall

But a higher agency interposes to prevent a needless carnage, and
Wisdom, in the person of her Goddess Minerva, comes down to check
the victors, and to prevent their abusing their triumph.
"Descendedfrom the Gods ! Ultsses, cease:

Parisian journalists continue to talk about "the gravity of these

should have been necessary to convince people of the gravity of a
situation and events that have resulted from the mistake of regarding
war, which has caused them, with levity.
GEMS FROM A FRENCH JOURNAL.
Among the multitude of extracts quoted from the French papers by
our own, here is at last a passage which evinces human reason, it
occurs in Le Figaro;—
I'The Figaro was the first, or at least among the first, to tackle resolutely
this double question—Is peace necessary r Is peace possible? To which we
replied, yea. It shows no cowardice, but rather courage, to break away from
the longing for vengeance and the heroic resolution to hold out which cause
the heart of France to throb. The time of florid phraseology to the sound of
the trumpet and the drum has ceased."
"0 bravo, Figaro, bravo bravissimo!"
The reasoning Figaro adds:—
"Paris and the departments are no longer willing to intoxicate themselves
with words, shouts, and trumpets."
It is very greatly to be hoped that this statement is as true as the
observations preceding it are rational. And let us trust that, if France
and Paris (especially Paris) have in truth been brought to their senses
by military disasters incurred through vainglorious frivolity, the wisdom
which they will have purchased by experience will not desert them when
experience has discontinued its teaching. As soon as they are restored
to prosperity—and the sooner the better—let them set to at dancing
again with all their soul, and toe and heel, and teach Europe to dance
as heretofore, that is to say, formerly, and not of late; for they latterly
taught people to dance the cancan, and have been violently carried
away from grace in the character of dancing-masters. But may we find
that they have finally left off talking about la gloire, and will never
again be heard shouting "A Berlin!" or "A" anywhere else, or
singing " Rataplan!" Having thoroughly realised the consequences
of breaking the peace, may they show that they have grown wiser than
wantonly to break it again, and then be as merry as they have become
wise; that is to say, much merrier than ever.

EXTRACTS FROM MY COMMON-PLACE BOOK.
(KB. The Authorities will be kept till called for.)
An acquaintance with Geology is much more common than is gene-
rally supposed: we all know chalk from cheese.
The melancholy to be traced in every portrait hitherto discovered of
the Chevalier Bayard, notably in the one by Salvator del Piomro,
hanging in the Assize Court at Bodmin, had a romantic origin. He
suffered a disappointment in early life when serving with the Saracens
in the Azores. The lady was young, beautiful, accomplished, well born,
and a capital housekeeper, with a profusion of fair hair, but poor; and
Bayard's great aunt, from whom he had considerable expectations,
opposed the match so violently that he was compelled to return the
Signora's likeness and letters, and never saw her again. In after
years she married the Admirable Crichton (at Dumfries), and, strange
vicissitude of fortune! one of their descendants died, at an advanced
age, within the walls of Marylebone Workhouse, towards the end of
the .French Kevolution.
The cromlechs which are scattered about the northern districts of
the Isle of Ely in plentiful abundance, decisively confirm Payne
Knight's supposition, first put forth in the Chirurgical Quarterly, that
the ancient Druids possessed many of the appliances of modern civilisa-
tion. There have been found in them tobacco-stoppers, toothpicks,
half-emptied bottles of hair-dye, shoe-buckles, walking-sticks, double
eyeglasses, and the insignia of the principal orders of Chivalry. A
very considerable collection of these curious relics of a bygone age may
be seen, during the winter months, in the gardens of the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford, on sending in your carte de visite to the Heads of
Houses in Convocation.
The marriage customs of different nations are an interesting study to
the political economist as well as to the disciple of Comte. Our prac-
tice of throwing old slippers after the happy carriage and pair, is only
an imitation of a usage long observed by the first settlers in Amster-
dam, who flung bootjacks, made of some soft material, at the bride-
groom the first thing in the morning, after a substantial breakfast at
the'principal hotel in the place.
Humroldt knew of no race of people, however savage and swarthy,
which did not keep up the custom of saluting the bridesmaids on the
return of the weddrng-party from church, except amongst the Mongols,
who tattoo them, instead, with true lovers' knots and the monogram of
the bride and groom interlaced, in red ink, at the chemist's.
There are full particulars of the speeches made at the wedding-
breakfasts of five of the leading Roman Consuls, but, unfortunately,
they are only to be found in the missing books of Livy. We know,
however, that Horace was particularly happy on these occasions, ana
that the toast of "The Bridesmaids! was almost always placed in
his hands. Tfie younger Puny made a neat and appropriate reply,
and pulled a cracker with Cleopatra after resuming his seat amidst
general applause.
The Pelasgic ladies did not wear orange-blossom in their bonnets,
but the common bindweed; and Stephanotis, which is now almost ex-
clusively the emblem of widows, was seized by the police under the
Merovingian dynasty.
The priests of Isis performed the marriage ceremony gratuitously on
the second Tuesday in every month, at a quarter to eleven, in the
vestry; the Norse women held it lucky for the best man to have the
nail of one lit tie finger less than the other; no Albanian girl ever
thinks of being married unless the barometer is at " Set Fair;" and
the dwellers in the heart of the Andes were the first to send "No
Cards."
History affords no brighter example of devotion to duty under pecu-
niary difficulties than is presented in the story of the abdication of
Charles the Fifth after the Battle of Lepanto, when he retired to
the Monastery of St. Bernard, with only a fourpenny-piece in his
pocket and one shirt collar. The dogs which accompanied him through
the snow on that memorable night have, by their descendants, made
the monastery celebrated in the periodical literature of all the nations
of the West; and the exciting competition for the Emperor's collection
of clocks and watches, when they were dispersed and sold by order of
the executors at Christie's, is still remembered by many of the oldest
inhabitants of Little Britain.
Caoliostro, in consultation with Dr. Dee, prescribed Jesuits' bark
for Charles, but none was to be had nearer than Port Royal, and the
heavy duty upon it at that day (this was before the Treaty of Commerce
was signed at Verona) prevented its importation in sufficiently large
quantities.
The Commerce of the Heptarchy rose to its greatest height under
Etrelwolf. The quarterly returns of the exports and imports are
si ill preserved under three locks and keys in the Jerusalem Chamber,
and show conclusively that our hardware had even then penetrated as
far north as Lapland, and much farther south than the Balearic Isles.
Bangles and breadstuffs were what we principally received in exchange
from the Western coast of Africa, but the supply of cocoa had hardly
at that day begun to assume the enormous proportions to which it has

ndeed, dear Punch, except
Le Follet, the Queen, and
the Englishwoman's Domes-
tic Magazine, and you, of
course, as a rule I never
read anything but the novels
of the day. Newspapers I
detest, unless when there is
a trial or something else
particularly interesting in
them: but the accompany-
ing slips were sent to me
in a note by a satirical
Stupe, as if they signified,
but I only laugh at such
ridiculous remarks. One of
them is out of a lecture on
Greek Art read to a So-
ciety recently by Mr. H.
C. Selous, praising up
those frightful statues you
see at places like the Bri-
tish Museum and Crystal
Palace, more than a hun-
dred years old, some of
them :—
"He concluded with some
remarks on the great per-
sonal beauty of the Greek
nation; their intellectual love of the beautiful, and adoration of the human
form, which he contrasted with the present senseless shapes, so destruc-
tive of perfect form and motion—high heels and waspish waists, that Nature
abhorred quite as much as a vacuum."
Senseless shapes, indeed; no shapes are as senseless as some obser-
vations, I think.
The other piece of nonsense is this s—
"' Brauty Spots.'—' It is a poor rule that won't work both ways.' Report
■ays that many of the ' coloured ladies1 of New York may be seen promenading
Broadway on a fine afternoon with countenances ornamented with a patch of
white court-plaster. If white faces can be made to see the absurdity of wear-
ing black patches, some good will be accomplished."—Lady's Own Faptr.
What a silly idea, when everybody knows that black patches set oft
a fair complexion, and make it look better, but white can only make
black look so much the uglier. Of course one sees that it is very
absurd to wear white patches on a black face, and any one capable of
seeing that, with a grain of common sense must see that wearing black
on a white face is just the reverse. I suppose those stupid artists, and
lecturers, and writers about the fashions, which they don't understand,
think they can persuade one that black is white.
As to the "adoration of the human form," and contrasting it with
"the present senseless shapes," I am sure there is more sense in those
shapes than there is in the heads of people who adore a marble Venus
with no shape at all to speak of, and they don't hinder motion in the
least, but on the contrary look nice, especially in dancing, and say what
you like about high heels they are very much worn, and small waists
too; so it's no use talking, for what is the reason why anything is
pretty and becoming P Because it is generally considered so at the tune,
and there's an end of it. The same applies to chignons, and all the
other fashions that are taken off and caricatured so by Sillies, which
only keeps them up longer for the very reason because they aggravate
and provoke men, especially those artists and authors who set them-
selves up for judges of dress when they had better mind their own
business, they are so conceited.
I am sure if those horrid statues were dressed in the costume of the
day, they would look much better, they need be, some of them—talk
about the ballet and evening parties! Then those dreadful old antique
things would be bearable to look at, and a sculpture gallery would have
something like the attraction of Madame Tussaud's. And the fun of it
would be, it would make all those professors and old fogies so cross.
Do, dearest Punch, recommend this to the Royal Academy, or who-
ever.it is, and oblige £ver TOurg fondly,

It is remarked that Cssarism has a second time failed

France, but Seizerism.
THE LOGIC OF DEMONSTRATION.
By customarily holding demonstrations, relative to the question of
the day, at present the War for instance, in Hyde Park, the working-
men, or to speak more definitely the handicraftsmen, are at any rate
setting an example to all other classes. If it were generally followed,
the clergy, the lawyers, the members of the medical profession, the civil
engineers, the Press, and all the other sections of which the commu-
nity is made up, would each of them hold its particular meeting in Hyde
Park. The men who work iu special departments other than the
vocation of manual labour have just as much reason to put themselves
forward in the character of distinct political bodies as the latter. But
the example set by the working-men is followed, and likely to be fol-
lowed, by no other classes than the dangerous classes, which makes it
a nuisance.

OUR MILITARY UNDERSTANDING.
We neutrals ought to learn some lessons from the War, even in such
matters as equipment of oar soldiers. Criticism specially has been
directed to their foot-gear, which is declared to be immensely inferior
to the French. The easy-fitting shoe and gaiter of their infantry weigh
half as muck as the thick, clumsy, galling boots we give our troops.
Soldiers very quickly learn where the shoe pinches when they are on a
march; and a bad boot very speedily deprives them of the power to pat
their best leg foremost. Troops may readily be crippled by the galling
of their foot-gear, and a military movement may be brought in this way
to a lame conclusion. The British soldier ought to have the very best
of boots, in order to enable him to walk well into an enemy; and for
this substantial reason we desire with all our heart and sole to see the
British Army pat upon a better footing.
LITTLE FINES FOR GREAT OFFENDERS.
Here is a scrap of news which, with some slight variation, appears
so very often that it might as well be stereotyped :—
"Sixty-four small tradesmen have been fined in all £77 15j., for possessing
short weights and measures."
The fines here barely average above a pound a head, though many of
these small tradesmen have doubtless been great rascals. The penalty
of having but a sovereign to pay can hardly be a sovereign preventive
of cheating. Perhaps, were larger fines imposed, we should hear of
smaller numbers of these petty cheats appearing at the petty sessions.

L o n d o n er,
after suffer-
ing the social
tortures of fa-
shion's sea-
son, that life
might be en-
joyable if it
were not for
its civilities.
For instance,
just consider
what amount
of time and
toil are annu
= ally wasted in
paying morn-
ing calls, and
in the like ri-
diculous per-
formance s,
which to so
many are a
nuisance, and
are of use
to nobody. As one reflects upon the precious leisure that one spends
upon these profitless observances, one feels inclined to envy the Ojib-
beways or Hottentots, or other noble savages, who manage somehow
to exist and to pursue their path in life, without the civilised necessity
of carrying a card-case.
As a measure of relief, we should wish to aid the passing of a social
Act of Parliament, for abolition of the usage of making calls in person,
and substitution of an easier and less time-wasteful method of ex-
changing such civilities. People even now are bold enough in certain
fashionable circles to make a morning call without descending from
their carriages: merely handing in their card to the servant at the
door, with an inquiry for the bodily well-being of the inmates. Nay,
some folks do not even give themselves the trouble to do so much as
this: but content themselves with sending round their footman with
their card-case, and thus discharge by deputy their duty to society,
with little inconvenience or sacrifice of time.
Further to facilitate this interchange of pasteboard, which is held to
be equivalent to making morning calls, we would throw out the sug-
gestion of a social Card-Exchange, or Central House of Call, where
morning calls might be exchanged with even more celerity and ease
than now is possible, even to those persons who avail themselves of
proxies in the mode above described. Here the representatives of
people owing morning visits might meet, say once a week, and thus be
spared the needless work of walking here and there to leave a bit of
pasteboard with my Lady Noodle or my Lord Tom Noddy. As a
still further economy, a clearing-house might be attached to the estab-
lishment, where, at the end of every season, all the cards therein dis-
tributed might be returned, like cheques, and then be sorted out in
heaps, and re-delivered to their owners, to be anew made use of, when
the recurrent season comes for making morning calls.
THE MODEL UNION OF ENGLAND.
Southampton is a place which has the rare credit of maintaining a
workhouse whereof the arrangements are humane. Paupers tempo-
rarily received into that asylum, but having a settlement elsewhere,
are said to greatly object to being removed. Knowing that much,
nobody will be surprised to read the subjoined notice, recorded in the
Hampshire Independent, under the head of " Cricket :—
"Cricket.—Southampton Union v. Seaulieu.—Played on Saturday, on the
ground of the latter, the Union winning on the first innings."
It is pleasant to think that there is one workhouse in England
whereof the poor inmates not only enjoy charitable accommodation,
but are also permitted to beguile their leisure with the manly game of
cricket. All work and no play, in workhouses, is the general rule;
but a gratifying exception to it is presented by Southampton, of course
making Jack a bright boy instead of a dull one. The girls in the
Southampton workhouse, doubtless, are indulged with recreation
corresponding to that granted to the boys, and allowed to amuse them-
selves, at, and during, reasonable hours, by the healthful exercise of
playing croquet, whose salutary effect keeps them out of the infirmary;
t he liberality of the ratepayers thus repaying itself. What a totally
different character from that which it bears would St. Pancras have,

A TITULA.R ON SPILLS.
Or course the Right Rev. Dr. Goss,
Roman Catholic Bishop of Liverpool,
is dissatisfied with the Education Act.
Referring to that enactment in a pas-
toral which he has lately issued, the
Right Reverend Doctor complains that
where the Catholics have no schools,
or not as many as they want, the Pro-
testant version' of the Bible may be
read and commented on by the school-
teacher; a provision which "places
the Catholics of England in a position
of peculiar hardship," and, adds his
Right Reverence, "involves us in
difficulties of which our fellow-citizens
have little or no share." Little or no
conception, his Right Reverence might
have said, for the hardship consists in
the obligation to contribute here and
there to a rate for the education of
children who do not belong to them,
or whom they have not looked after,
in some degree of religion other than
their own; and the only difficulties
wherein they can be involved will be
summed in the difficulty of paying the
rate. Dr. Goss signifies "the degrada-
tion and profanation to which "the
Bible "will be exposed by being used as a class-book" in the following
sensible and suggestive remarks:—
"In the hands of thoughtless children it cannot escape the common fate
that awaits all used-up schoolbooks. Mahommedans reverently put aside
every scrap of paper bearing the name of God; but parliamentary Christians
axe willing to expose it to the sorriest end, provided they can force it on an
unwilling people."
Everybody must see at a glance how true it is that, in providing that
the Protestant Bible shall be read by non-Catholic children, parliamentary
Christians will, as Dr. Goss says, force a scrap of paper such as he men-
tions on an unwilling people. But if they thereby expose that scrap of

HERE HE IK, REMARKING, CONFIDENTIALLY, THAT "THAT
GINGER-PEER IS APOUT THE PEST HE EVER TASTED."
paper to the sorriest end, they also
expose along with it much more
paper, covered with what the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Liverpool must con-
sider most objectionable print; here-
tical translation. Few, if any, eccle-
siastics of Dr. Goss's cloth would not
rejoice to see every scrap of such
printed paper burned, and Dr. Goss
may console himself with the hope that
all that paper will ultimately be used
to light fires; an end for it which must
be the sorriest he can contemplate.
Just a Little Fishy.
A mathematical young lady, being
asked to give a definition of an acute
angle, described it to her governess as
an angle for a husband, which was
sharp enough to hook a hundred
thousand pounder.
Two-Edged Device.
A firm of eminent Brewers adver-
tise their beer by means of a pictorial
device in the centre whereof is placed
their trade-mark, in the shape of a

This symbolises open-handedness and fair-dealing, and is no idle vaunt.
But it would also suit the recreant Bung, when, for the good bitter
ale brewed by those gentlemen, he Palms off bitter bad beer.

MEDITATIONS ON THE EVE OF MICHAELMAS.
BY A MAN OF FEELING.
It is the hour when 'mid the trees
Sighs fitfully the evening breeze:
When, ceasing from their busy ham,
Bees to their hive, well-laden, come:
When frogs begin their nightly croak,
And owls forsake the sheltering oak:
When rooks that homeward wing their flight,
Reluctant bid the worms good night:
When spiders, as from sport they cease,
Leave hapless flies to sleep in peace:
When the bright glowworm's lamp is seen
Illumining the village green:
When beetles, blind as any bat,
Bounce rudely 'gainst your nose or hat:
When cats their nightly prowl begin,
And wandering organs cease their din:
When cooks the evening meal prepare,
And savoury viands scent the air:
When with the odour greens produce
Mingles the fragrance of roast goose:
And men who sniff a pleasant smell
Delight to hear the dinner-bell.
INFALLIBLE PUNSTERS.
"Non Angli, sed Angeli'' said Infallibility in the person
of Grrgory the Great. Infallibility, by the mouth of
Plo Nono, said nearly as good a thing the other day.
According to a Correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazelle :—
"He teems in good spirits, and distributes his cutting bon-
mot$ as usual. When informed that even the French volunteers
were recalled, be is reported to hare said, ' Qu'est-ce que 9a me
fait? La France ne morde plus. £Ue a perdu ses dents."
(Sedan)."
It is to be hoped that his modus vivendi as a Pontifical
Lord Mayor of the Leonine City will suit his Holiness's
convenience, bat otherwise (with large endowment of the
jocular faculty of which he is accustomed to make snch
brilliant displays as the pun above-quoted) there can be
no doubt whatever about the one spot where the Holy
Father should seek an asylum; and we can assure him
of a cordial welcome and profitable employment in Fleet
Street
.
"THE MEANEST MAN OF MEN."
(Wordsworth, of Napoleon I.)
The leading journal has been publishing a very interesting and well-
timed reprint of certain passages from its articles written at other
times, when Paris was, as she is now, " isolated from all the rest of the
world." (Strange words to pen concerning the supposed capital of the
universe.)
To one extract Mr. Punch begs leave to call the attention of all his
readers. It is the announcement of the escape of the First Napoleon
from the mild comfinement in which he was placed by those who
miraculously retained a belief that be could be trusted.
On the 11th March, 1815, the Times writes thus :—
"Early yesterday morning we received by express from Dover the impor-
tant but lamentable intelligence of a civil war having been again kindled in
France by that wretch Bonaparte, whose life waa so impolitically spared by
the Allied Sovereigns. It now appears that the hypocritical villain, who at
the time of his cowardly abdication affected an aversion to the shedding of
blood in civil warfare, has been engaged during the whole time of his residence
at Elba in carrying on secret and treasonable intrigues with the tools of his
former crimes in France. At length, when his plots were ripe, he sailed from
Elba with all his guards, on the night of the 28th ult, and landed near
Frejua, in France, on the 3rd inst."
The result was, as everybody knows, the horrible carnage of Waterloo,
and the transportation of the " hypocritical villain" to an island where
he was kept very safely until this world was relieved of one of the worst
men who ever defaced it. His life was again spared by the Sovereigns,
and this time it was well. For his later years were beneficial to man-
kind. They revealed the base nature of the man so completely that
any admiration which his military genius had inspired was speedily
forgotten in the revelations of his falseness and meanness. But of late
years there has been some affectation of regilding the brazen image,
and of worshipping the Brute Force of which he was the type. There-
TOU LTX.
fore, we thank the Times for reproducing the honest and straight-
forward utterances which expressed the feeling of our fathers, in days
when sentimentalism was not allowed to mingle in the rough business
of the world, and when treachery was not condoned because it was
successful. Treachery indeed is a mild word when we read in the
same articles that Napoleon seized hundreds of English civilians who
had visited France on the faith of peace being maintained, and that he
kept them in his fortresses as " prisoners of war" for eleven years—
an act dictated by spite alone, for it could have no influence on the
campaigns.
"Napoleonic ideas" are not yet quite crushed out of France, though
recent events have done much to that good end, and it is well that this
British protest should be recollected. Mr. Punch has more than once
had hard words used to him because he has always invited his readers
to regard the First Napoleon in the light in which the Times regarded
him in 1815, but the more that the life of the man is studied, the more
righteous is the above judgment found to be. We have not too often
the good fortune to agree with Mr. Goldwin Suith, but we may cor-
dially endorse on the Times testimonial of '15 the Professor's verdict in
'69; namely, that there is " hardly a baser name in history."
The Italian Capital.
The reunion of Rome with Italy may give occasion for the remark
respecting Victor-Emmanuel, that success has at last crowned the
venture of an enterprising capitalist. May the capital acquired by the
Italian Kingdom conduce to an immense improvement in its financial
affairs.
NOT LIKE THOSE POBEION COUNTRIES.
Mrs. M alaprop hopes she will never live to see the day when all the
fine young men in this happy country will be turned into soldiers by a
Subscription. She vows she will not distribute a sixpence towards it.

THE BOOMPJE PAPERS.

A VI3IT TO THE CELEBRATED PLEASURE GARDENS OF THE MODEL
VILLAGE OF BROEK.
Drive to Broek. Objects of
interest, windmills, canals,
ditches, flit country bearing
a family resemblance to that
cheerful swamp on either
side of the line between
Fenchurch Street and Til-
bury, cattle, and peasants
who touch their hats vaguely
to anybody in a carriage.
This touching custom does
not aim at the traveller's
pocket, for there are no
vagrant beggars in Holland.
In the Jew's quarter, on
our coming out of the syna-
gogue, we were assailed, it
is true, by a noisy crowd
of female mendicants (why
not say womendicants P), all
daughters of Israel, or rather
grandmothers of Israel, to
judge by their appearance,
held out their palms and shrieked for largesse. Jour, who
frightened by this demonstration, threw coins among them
(to be charged to Bond the paymaster in a future accouur), and
climbed on to the box of the carriage as quickly as possible. This was
the only instance of begging that we encountered daring our sojourn
in the Land of Boompje.
Our driver, with whom we conld not argne in any language, had us
completely in his power on the road to Brock. A flourish of his whip
and a jerk of his hand towards a turning to the right indicated that he
intended leaving the straight road in order to drive through a pair of
open iron gates.
"What^s he doing P" asks Bond.
Jomp answers with his usual characteristic readiness and love of
troth, "Veil—um—um—he is going through the gates."
"When to f" inquires Maullir.
Jomp looks about him from his perch of observation, and having
thought, the matter out replies," Veil—am—am—1 don't know," which,
of coarse, is highly satisfactory.
It tarns out, however, that we are being taken up to a Model Farm.
"Useful thing," observes Maullir R. A., "for Artists." He
makes a note to the eflvct. I believe that when he returns to England
he will propose to the Governing Body of the Academy the institution I jeering.
who
was
of a Model Farm, or a Farm for Models, where Artists shall be able
to call and make their own selection.
Tiie Model Farmeresses are at the door of their cottage. Two of
them. There are no Model Farmers visible. Bund informs us (on what
authority we do not know, as there is nothing about it in Murray) that
the Dutch are very fanciful about their cattle, and decorate the cows'
tails on Sundays and holidays with bunches of ribands.
The elder Model Farmeress snows us her neat dairy, the milk-pans,
milk-pails, and cheeses in various stages. It is all scrupulously clean
and tidy. She explaius to us, that is, we imagine she is explaining to
as, the process by which milk is made into cheese, and we are much
obliged to her. We are led into the cowhouse, but the cattle are in the
fields, so we don't gather much from this inspection. She then shows
as the family beds. These curiously illustrate ths semi-canal life of
the Dutch, for they are berths made np in cupboards in the wall.
Perhaps the house itself has no foundations, bat only a keel, so that in
of unexpected inundation, the entire farm would rise from its
ward anxiously to Broek, or "Brook," as it is pronounced. Bund
quotes Murray about. Broek. He says, "Such an accumulation of
pivtlions, arbours, summer-houses, pagodas, bridges, and temples—
Gothic, Grecian, Chinese, and Rustic—are nowhere else to be seen."
"By Jove!" exclaim Muntley and Finton simultaneously. Bund
telh us that here we shall see wooden figures moving by clockwork to
a tune played by some invisible instrument. Here he pauses and sighs,
for his thouthts are upon his violoncello at home, ana he never ceases
to regrt t that, he did not bring it with him. He believes it would have
enlivened us as we drove about, or, at all events, have kept us awake
after dinner.
Goocr has a proposal for him. It is that he might have his violon-
cello made portable: the handle to take in and out, the back to open,
and the inside might serve as a portmanteau, "from which," says
Gooch, "you would only have to remove your stockings and thiugs
when yoo wanted to play."
The consideration of this novelty occupies us till we reach Broek.
Our driver stops at an inn outside the village.
"Why doesn't he drive into the villageP" asks Gooch, who likes to
make an imposing entry.
Jomp explains, "He cannot drive into the village—um—um—
because dere i» no road."
Busd corroborates this from Murray.
We enter t he village path, paved in the centre with tiles, like • back
kitchen. There isa row of little houses on either side, not very unlike,
those meteorological toy-cottages, in which the little old-fashioned lady
and gentleman never could live together under any circumstances,
except perhaps something going wrong with the pivot on which their
lives turned.
We are pounced upon by an elderly syren lady in a satin dress (a
"Mature Syren," Sat Rev.) who with varioai blandishments induces
us, all more or less objecting, to enter her abode.
tn her front parlour the Lowther Arcade, the penny bazasr of
Oxford Street, Margate and Ramsgate shops, and those unique empo-
riums on Brighton pier have poured oat their choicest treasures. Here
are "tnflis from Broek" in Dutch, pen-wipers inscribed "Broek,"
of Broek (Sbanklin, Isle of Wight, I believe, with Broek written
it) in glass paper weights; knives with wooden handles, ou
is carved the magic name of Broek, as if it was that of a
Sheffield cutler. Japanese stores innumerable, as if Broek had once
been to Japan, and brought all these things away; or as if the Japanese
had find from Broek, leaving valuables at hap-hazard behind them.
Then the old lady must needs show us her autograph-book and her
photograph-book. The former contained the signature of the Emperor
Nicholas, who seems to have visited Broek, and "expressed himself
much pleased," as the visitors' books have it.
We escape from the elderly show-woman (leaving JOmf in her
clutches) glad to get away from her at any price.
A troop of children follow us, most objectionable children, evidently
Maullie injudicionsly makes a face and shakes his umbrella
moorings, and sail about doing business with other farms and
(similarly provided), just as if nothing had happened out of tl
ordinary course of events.
Noah must have been a Dutchman; and if Ham hadn't gone as a
colonist to Africa, Van Ham would have been a peculiarly Dutch
name.
After seeing Holland one prostrates oneself before that Grand Ro-
mantic Genius who could so far shake off the trammels of tact, as to
conceive such an improbable character as the Flying Dutchman. The
Swimming Dutchman, the Diving Dutchman, the Floating Dutchman,
the Sculling Dutchman, the Punting Dutchman, all these would have
occurred to the ordinary mind, but the Flying Dutchman is, so to
speak, the result of such a flight of imagination as to command our
admiration and excite our wonder.
The idea might have been suggested by the contemplation of the
Flying Fish, which ought to be, if Nature were only consistent, a
Dutch Herring.
Quitting the Models, we drive on to Broek. Gooch is looking for-
at their ringleader, and from that moment we are mobbed by the
children of the Model Village.
Where are the gardens so celebrated hy Murray? Jomp insists upon
a turning to the left being the direct road. This induces us afonce,
and instinctively, to choose the right.
Jomp takes his road: we ours. The children follow us.
We fiud ourselves in a dilapidated ragged garden, cut up into various
narrow paths, full of weeds, bordered by straggling bushes, and
exhibiting no signs of the gardener's care and attention for years pist.
It depresses us. "This," says Maullir, "cannot be the garden."
"N o," exclaims Gooch, with an attempt at assurance (all Boompje!)
"didn't you say," referring to Bund, "that there was a mermaid here,
and many swans, and mechanical figures, and a lakeP"
Bund had ventured apon this, relying upon Murray. We stop in
the middle of a path. The children behind us jeer. We are losing our
amiable tempers. An old crone comes towards us, bent with age. She
can only laugh and chuckle, and jingle some keys she has in her hand.
From her signs we gather that she is the Guardian of the Art Treasures.
Mai: i.i.t k makes a sketch of her for his new picture. The Lancashire
Witches. She only wants a broom to be the very thing: oaly if she
had a broom we shouldn't see any more of her, as nothing could prevent
her flying away on it to a "Sabbath" somewhere in the neighbour-
hood.
She is full of chuckles, evidently at the idea of any party of people
being such fools as to waste their time in visiting Broek.
She takes us to the lake, points oat the pavilion, where a wooden
man, sometime mechanical, is now lying on the ground with broken legs
and arms, and the paint washed almost entirely off his face by the rain
through the roof, and she points out the mermaid.
"That!" we all exclaim. Yes, there is no doubt of it. On the top
of a ruined summer-house (everything is in ruins) is perched a little
zinc or tin mermaid, about eight inches high, intended to serve as a
weathercock, only (this being Broek) of course it is out of order, and
won't move.
"Gentlemen," says M aullie, seriously, addressing us collectively,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"we have come all the way from England to Holland, have endured
much, and have travelled night and day in order to see a broken
weather-cock in the shape of a diminutive mermaid!"
The crone shows us two mechanical figures which do move on being
wound up. The children follow us, and are delighied. It is a melan-
choly performance, and ouly the model children of Broek could find
pleasure in such an entertainment,.
The two mechanical figures look as if they'd been rejected by
Madam is Tussaud's Committee of Selection for the Chamber of
Horrors.
Finally, there is a cuckoo-clock, which the old woman is very proud of.
In fact, imagine our Golden Square in autumn unswept, and strewn
with toys of children as at the seaside, Cremorne on a wet Sunday in
October, Shoreham Gardens (including its lake) without tea and
shrimps, waiters or visitors, people the place with a few old battered
ships' figure-heads from the works by Vauxhall Bridge, throw in a
tenth-hand rustic arbour or two from some suburban villa to be sold
a bargain, and you will have some faint idea of the appalling desolation
of the Pleasure Gardens of Broek.
Broek, to be true to itself, and to save travellers time and money,
should be spelt and pronounced " Broke."
The immortal advice once given by Mr. Punch to mankind with
regard to those about to marry, may be well repeated here:—
to those about to visit Broek:—Don't!

EXTRACTS FROM MY COMMON-PLACE BOOK.
(N.B. The Authorities will be kept till called for.)
stonishkg are the
phenomena of sun-
dry dreams, even
to Members of the
British Association!
Dr. Parr told Lord
Nklson, a day or
two before the Bat-
tle of the Nile, that
he constantly dreamt,
he was chasing' the
Greek article up the
backstairs of the
Trafalgar at Green-
wich ; after a supper
of stewed mush-
rooms and hot elder
wine, well spiced,
Alexander Cru-
der was sure to go
to sleep and dream
of correcting inter-
minable proof-sheets
of Bradshaio ; John-
son records in his
diary, that on the
night of Michaelmas
Day, 1774-,hedreamt
he was entertaining
the young Princesses with Banbury cakes and Guinness's stout in the Tower, while
Burke amused the Prince of Wales and his brothers by allowing them to
ride round the room on his back; if his digestion was the least out of order,
Loud Stowell invariably imagined himself to be a porter, loading a railway
carriage at Newcastle-upon-Tyne with heavy luggage in a snow-storm; ODCe,
when Petrarch was staying with the Machiavellis from Saturday to Monday, he
awoke the whole house, including the children, with a loud "Tally-ho!"—he
fancied he was hunting with Leo the Tenth's beagles in theCampagna ; regularly
as quarter-day came round, Luther used to dream he was a journeyman baker
in the Victualling Yard, making French rolls for Madame de Maintenon wear-
ing a white satin apron fringed with silver bells; and, if Cardinal Wolsey
took more than three glasses of sack negus before going to bed, he paid for his
indiscretion by dreaming he was selling Anne Boleyn a pound of Oxford
sausages on the Capstone at llfracombe, and that she got out of the shop before
he found she had given him a bad half-crown.
The Laced acmouians had no dreams, except in boisterous weather and at the
Equinox, and the Albigenaes only indulged in them every other year. Amongst,
the ancient Carthaginians it was considered lucky to dream of a gingham umbrella
with a horn-handle in the spare bed-room; but most unfortunate, if a black setter
ran down the gravel walk and met an old woman in a red cloak returning from the
dentist's.
Dreams were not known earlier than the old red sandstone period, and to this
day there is no mention of them in the cheap editions of Domesday Book.
"History repeats itself "—so writes Cardinal Richelieu in a letter to Calvin,
and no one has thought it necessary to contradict him—indeed the extraordinary
coincidence of a lunar rainbow having been seen on board ship, both after the
Battle of the Frogs and Mice and the glorious Victory of" the First of June,"
appears to strengthen this axiom of the wily Minister of Peter the Grrat.
Again, the milkman went his rounds as usual the morning after the Battle of
Waterloo, and the same phenomenon was observed by the reviewers, before the
news of the fall of the Byzantine Empire bad been circulated twenty-four hours in
the coffee-houses of Stamboul. We know, too, by the testimony of intelligent
bystanders, that it was a beautiful evening the night of the passing of the
first Reform Bill, people walking about in Parliament Street without their hats, and
the Milky Way unusually brilliant: the weather was equally auspicious when
Montgomery, accompanied by his black servant, made his first balloon ascent
from the terraces at Versailles, in the presence of the King and the entire Corps
diplomatique.
On the other hand, it ought to be noticed that although
the potato disease followed the Great Plague, there was
no similar epidemic in the vegetable districts of Ireland
after the Municipal Corporations Bill received the Royal
Assent.
Those were the palmy days of the British Drama, when
every hand in the theatre was raised to applaud good actors
and good acting.
The evening was calm and collected. The artisans had
ceased their labours at the Breakwater. The last belated
puflin had flown home to his nest on the Mew Stone.
The boom of the gun from "Drake's Island" was corro-
borating the local Almanack in its assertion that the
sun set at 6 40 p.m. The green sward of the Hoe at
Plymouth was crowded with all the rank and file of the
West, when tidings of the Spanish Armada having been
sighted by the coastguard on the Cheviots were suddenly
brought by a mounted horseman, in breathless haste, in
a sealed packet, from the Warden of the Stannaries to
Drake, and Raleigh, and Hawkins, and Humphrey
Gilrert, and stout old Frorisher, and John Knox, all
intent on a game of bowls with the Corporation and
resident Clergy. Without a quarter of an hour's hesitation,
they flung down the implements of amusement, snatched
up their rapiers, left the Port Ad miral to pay the reckoning,
hurried down the steps waving their pocket handkerchiefs,
and crying " St. George for old England!" took to their
galleons and their grog, and sailed away, amid tokens
of universal respect, to achieve one of the most glorious
enterprises enshrined in the glowing pages of Hume and
Smollett.
What a subject for a painter!
AN ANGLICAN APERY.
The friends of "Father Ignatius" have surely aban-
doned him again. According to the Times:—
"The monastery founded by the Rev. Mr Ltnr (Father
Ignatius) is now in course of erection, and the exterior walls
are ulready raised many feet in height. It is situated in a most
remote spot at the topof the secluded vale of Ewilas, among spurs
of the Brecknockahire 'Black Mountains,' at a place called
Capel-y-fin—the 'Chapel of the Boundary' of three counties,
Brecon, Hereford, and Monmouth."
The monk-house of Father Ignatius and his monks
will not be within easy reach of visitors. It is not, how-
ever, nor would it, or any other such simious institution
be, too far off if it were at Jericho. That, consideration pre-
vents us from complaining that the distance from Fleet
Street to "the secluded vale of Ewilas" will be a long, way
to go and see " our poor relations."
May a conductor who beats time to an " Op." of Bach
or Beethoven be reasonably regarded by the audience as

ITALY AT BOME.
King Honestman, lo, rival Powers fall out
And Italy and thou come by your own!
So much of good has evil brought about,
Vain, base, brute force by force yet greater strewn,
The force of her who fain would rule alone
In Europe, nor an equal neighbour bear.
Her bayonets propped old feeble Priestcraft's throne.
She forced the yoke she scorned herself to bear
On Rome. That she could do. She did what she did dare.
She should bave been content to domineer
And trample on the weak; but she needs must,
In arrogant intolerance of a peer,
Assail a stronger, underweighed. Her lust
Of glory has been humbled to the dust;
And Jezerel can queen it now no more.
In deadliest arms she put too fond a trust:
She now, henceforth must vanity give o'er
So far, content with rouge, as not to shriek for gore.
Her Chassepots have worked wonders now at last,
Through faith o'erweening in their murderous fire.
Therefore thou owest them the Rome thou hast;
They have accomplished Italy's desire;
Their need her troops has forced her to retire.
They made the lackey's "Never!" a vain word.
The Eldest Daughter of a doting Sire,
Who Liberty made sick with hope deferred.
No longer can sustain a sway, effete, absurd.
Victor-Emmanuel, thou bast gained the meed
Of patience and high courage; valour i
On the red battle-field in gallant deed
Not only; but thy fortitude serene.
And conscience daring on itself to lean,
The couch of mortal danger did attest.
Thou wouldst let no priest's menace intervene
Between thee and thy country; self-possessed
And steadfast of resolve formed in a true man's breast.
Long mayst thou sit upon the Caesars' throne,
What never Cicsar was though thou sbalt be.
When Ceesars were, no liberty was known:
Thy subjects will be citizens as free
As Rome of old did Romans ever see.
The work which was by thy Cavoue begun,
Which Gariraldi bled to do for thee,
Which jealous France so long forebade, is done.
And thou art King in Rome, and Italy is one.
A BISHOP'S ROD.
News from Salmonia says, that, one day last week,
"The Bishop of Rochester killed no fewer than six fine salmon."
Who will say that his Lordship is not a lineal (ha! ha!) successor
of the Fishermen! We heartily rejoice to find an excellent hierarch
enjoying himself so rationally; and when he is making his next distri-
bution of fishes, he may remember that though 85, Fleet Street, is not
exactly in his Lordship s diocese, Mr. Punch is above parochialism, and
likes Salmon.
The Fortune of War.
The French private soldier is often told, for his encouragement,
that he carries in his knapsack the baton of a marshal. Nobody ever
tells him that he is muoh more likely to be carrying a wooden leg.

COMPARATIVE ANTHROPOLOGY.
rult "One touch of
Mature makes the
whole world kin."
"KinP" said Smel-
fungtjs. "Shouldn't
it, be 'kick'P" Smel-
fungus had been to
the British Associa-
tion's meeting, and
there heard a lecture,
of course worth hear-
ing, from Sir. John
Loerock, "On the
Social and Religious
Condition of the Lower
Races of Man." Among
savages, said the ac
complished lecturer:—
"The position of the
women is very unfortu-
nate. They are treated
like slaves, or almost like
domestic animals. Thus,
in Australia, little real
affection exists between
husband and wife, and
young men value a wife
principally for her ser-
vices as a slave; in fact,
when asked why they
are anxious to obtain
wives, their usual reply
is that they may get
wood, water, and food for them, and carry whatever property they possess."
Among the Lower Races of Men, such as the Australian savages, it is the rule
that a mam marries from selfish motives, and that little love is lost between husband
and wife. Among the Higher Races of Men, snch as the British Superior Classes
is this same state of conjugal affairs very much the exceptionP
Sir John continued, still referring to Australia :—
"The position of women in that country is wretched in the extreme. 'Few
says Kyre, 'will be found upon examination to be free from frightful scars upon the hi

or the marks of spear-wounds about the body. I have seen a
young woman who, from the number of these marks, appeared
to have been almost riddled with spear-wounds.'"
What is the principal difference between the condition
of women in the wilds of Australia and that of wives in
the London slums P May it not be said to be mainly
commensurate with the difference between spears, and fists,
or hob-nailed ankle-jacks P Are the fair sex at the An-
tipodes scarred with spear-wounds in a measure much
greater than, in the land we tread, a considerable portion
of them are disfigured by black eyes and bruisesP
Lovers of their species can reflect upon Sir John Lur-
rock's new illustrations of human brotherhood.
military harvests.
We find in a contemporary a fine big-sounding phrase
about Prussia being "enriched by her late harvest of vast
military successes." Well, there is clearly no denying that,
as far as glory goes, Prussia has succeeded in gathering
of late a most abundant crop of it. But harvests such
as these are so expensive in the reaping that we doubt if
any country can be said to be enriched by them. Military
success is a good thing in its way, but it is possible to
have too much of a good thing, and even such good things
as a military triumph may be purchased at a price which it
is ruinous to pay for them. However rich they may be,
harvests such as these are tolerably certain to impoverish
a country. The work of planting Corn, no doubt, is not so
glorious as the work of planting Cannon; but however
rich a crop of military successes may be gathered by a
war, we may depend that a good crop of wheat most always
prove more profitable.
A Truism of the Time.
Prussia, says Count Bf.rnstorff, wants us to observe
towards her a " benevolent" neutrality. But a neutrality
acknowledged to be benevolent by Prussia would be re-
sented as a malevolent neutrality by France. It is too
evident that neutrality can please neither.
OZOKERIT: A PLANT.
(From a Manuscript in a Collection, entitled " Fakements of ye Future,"
ascribed to Dr. Dee.)
Certayn Chaundlera in London, having devysed a new Kind of
Stuff, for to make Candles withal, dyd forthwith cast about also to
devyse Means to puff ye same, to the End that they might sell ye
most Candles they colde. Fyrst of all, therefore, they dyd give it
a strannge Name. They cleped ytt Ozokerit, which, in ye Greek
Tongue, signifieth somewhat smellynge like Wax. And this word,
Ozokerit, they dyd cause to be published along with ye Puffes in ye
Papers, and on ye Walles, and in ye Omnibuses and Railway Carriages,
and alle Places where Posters and Puffs abound, insomuch that, where-
soever a Man colde goe, ye Word Ozokerit dyd stare hym in ye Face.
This dyd they to the Intent that Ozokerit sholde be soe bruited about
and noised abroad that all Menne (and Women) sholde mam 11 what1
ytt mote mesne. And soe, indeed, ytt came to pass anon that
everye Man sayd to his Neighbour, Wist ye what Ozokerit is P" or
"What ye deuyll is OzokeritP" And soe ye Name, Ozokerit, being
in everye Mouth, ye Chaundlera reckoned that, when the Candles
sholde come out, all the World wolde straightway run and buy them, I
understanding they were ye Thing. Wherefore they kept on puffvnge
their Ozokerit for the space of 111 or 1V Moneths. Ye biggest, Fooie
alive may know that alle thys Puffynge of Ozokerit must needs have
cost ye Puffers deare.
Now there dwelt at Knightesbridge a certayn Hatter, a cunninge
Fellowe, who bethought him of a Dodge whereby to turn all thys
Puffing of Ozokerit to hys own End. Soe that, whiles alle People
were mervayling what Ozokerit sholde bee, but as yet none colde tell,
what dydd he doe but putte vp in hys Shoppe-windowe a Scroll,
whereon was written :—
OZOKERITS, at 14*. 6rf.
Meaning hys Hattes. And soe he toke ye Benefit of alle ye Puffynge
which ye Chaundlera had payed for, and cost hym Nothing.
The common Saying ys, Mad as a Hatter," yet certes thys Hatter
at any Rate had his Senses about hym. Albeit but a Hatter by Trade,
he was able, ye see, to make a Boot. Yet peradvent ure some, albeit
they judge him to haue bin a crafty Cove, wyll nathless account hym
alsoe somewhat of a Noodel, yn that, whiles he bad ye Wit to filch his
Neighbours' Puff, knowing ytt was a Word not understanded of ye
People, at ye same Time ytt is to be feared he soe lacked Learning
that he onderatoode not that Worde hymself.
PRISONERS OF THE JURY.
Civilisation in England is not at present disgraced by an atrocious
war brought by Englishmen on themselves. We are not as other
people are in that particular. No, hut in the Times report of the
Baby-Farming Case at the Central Criminal Court, there occurs the
following passage, relative to the conclusion of the first day's pro-
ceedings :—
"At this stage, it being now half-past four o'clock, the trial was adjourned
until this (Thursday) morning, at ten o'clock, and is likely to last two more
days. Meanwhile the jury were taken to the Cannon Street Hotel to spend
the night in charge of an usher of the Court."
The Juries' Amendment Act of last Session has not abolished the
barbarism of which an additional instance, above recorded, has dis-
graced our age. There is no doubt a considerable class of persons
disposed to laugh at sympathy with jurors subjected to the nuisance of
incarceration and compulsory intrusion on one another's privacy all
night, sometimes for several successive nights. All such are persons
who, being exempt from service on juries, are in no fear of being forced
to pig together in a manner which, if they themselves were so treated,
would unspeakably disgust them. Of course, they will be ready with
plenty of arguments to demonstrate the necessity of perpetuating a
practice which inflicts no annoyance at all on themselves and very much
on other people. Consistency will require them to go farther, and
show the ill consequences that result from not locking jurors up, but
letting them go home and go to bed, on protracted trials for mis-
demeanour; since a grave misdemeanour may incur a heavier sentence
than what would be awarded to a light felony. And, once more be it
said, lock up the jury, lock up the judge.
Fact, of Course.—In some parts of England the water is so hard
that skating on it is kept up all through the summer.

AFFECTING INSTANCE OF GRATITUDE.
Not much that is delightful, in the way of news, has come from Paris
lately. But, for one exquisite anecdote, thank the Post.-—
"President Zianoacomi, the Judge who for his staunch imperialism was
selected to plead at the High Court of Blois, the other day noticed the K.m-
rKnott's bust yet remaining in Court, and said to the Usher, 'Take that
away, or I shall go.'"
Overcome by his feelings! They did credit to his heart; and their
expression was a prodigy of eloquent pathos. We never before met
with anything equal to it; no, not in Ireland.

EUTHA.NASIA EXTRAORDINARY.
Noticino the departure to the Happy Racing Grounds of " Poor
old Tom Wintering ram," host of the Spa Hotel, at Croft, near
Darlington, "Argus" says, in the Post:—
"The cause of his death is said to hare been the selling of his yearling filly,
half-sister to Perth, at York, for 520 guineas; and it was said there that if
Perth had won another race it would have killed the old man, as he was so
excited about him."
Certainly if any man could choose the manner of his death, he would
prefer to die of joy, as apparently died this veteran of the Turf, "poor
old Tom Winteringham." "So good a death argues a well-spent
life," we may say quoting the converse of the divine Williams. And
that life, observe, was a particularly horsey one. This is remarkable;
because, from the operation of some mysterious biological law, seem-
ingly analogous to that of electrical induction, the positive nobleness
of that noble animal the horse appears generally to induce an opposite
condition upon those who have habitually much to do with it. As a
rule, perhaps, there is no class of men amongst whom are to be found
a greater number of rogues than amoog those who get their living by
any means relative to horses; bat to this rule Mr. Winteringham,
whose euthanasia was occasioned by the excess of happiness with which
the sale of his filly for 520 guineas had transported him, presents an
edifying exception. He evidently combined honesty with horse-worship.
Peace to his manes; and, 'Arkv, mind how you pronounce that word,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A FRENCH CHECK UPON TRADE CHEATS.
Honest Friend Punch,
Who will deliver us from the adulterators P I looked in vain
to Parliament, now I appeal in hope to Punch. Our bread, our cheese,
,our butter, our milk, our tea, our coffee, our beer, our wine, our spirits,
are all noxiously adulterated; and when we fall ill, as 'tis no wonder
that we do, adulterated medicines are prescribed for our relief. Ten
years afro we wisely passed an Act to stop all this: and see what a
contemporary says of this great effort of our Collective Wisdom :—
"It can onlv be put in operation by the voluntary resolution of Town
Councils and other local bodies, generally entirely under the influence, if not
entirely composed of the very persons against whose malpractices its provisions
are directed. The penalties also which can be enforced under it, even if it
should be put in operation, are so small and insignificant that they furnish no
adequate motive to a dishonest tradesman to abstain from the commission of a
moderately remunerative, far less of a highly lucrative. fraud. Moreover, it
does not apply to drugs or' articles usually taken or sold as medicines.'"
To set a thief to catoh a thief may be an act of sapience, provided
that the catcher have no sympathy with the person to be caught. But
small tradesmen who unite in plundering the public are hardly the best
punishers of their own misdeeds. I am a Briton to the backbone, but
I cannot help opining that in France they manage these things better
than we here do:—
"If the adulteration be with any material injurious to health, a fine of
from 50 to 500 fraves, together with an imprisonment of from three months
to two years, may be imposed. A fine of Irom 16 to 25 francs and an im-
prisonment of from six to ten days, or either penalty, may be indicted upon
traders who, without legitimate excuse, shall have on their premises any
adulterated substance; and if the adulteration be with any material injurious
to health, the tine maybe increased to 50 francs, and the imprisonment to
fifteen days. In the event of a further conviction within five years of the
first, the punishments are doubled In all cases the particulars of the offence
are publicly advertised at the expense of the offender."
I can recollect the tine when English caricaturists depicted skinny
Frenchmen and Englishmen rotund. The reverse of this is nowadays
a trifle nearer to the truth, and perhaps adulteration is the reason of
the change. At all events, I certainly should like to see the French
system adopted here, and the thefts of cheating tradesmen advertised
at their own cost. How delightful it would be to read announcements
such as this :—
TF YOU WISH TO PURCHASE IMPURE TEA, and bad, unwhole-
-L some Coffee, go to Cheap and Nastie, adulterators wholesale, 64, Great
Swindle Street. This firm has long been celebrated as the worst in the vicinity.
N.B. Twice convicted and fined heavily within the last six months.
Or how would some of our small tradesmen like the look of this P—
DOWN AGAIN IN BREADSTUFFS! This is to give Notice that
the name of Judas Shoetweight, Cheatside, was on Monday last
put Down Aoain in the Bow Street Covrrt Police sheet. Being convicted for
the third time of fraudulent adulteration with intent, Ace, the culprit was
condemned to fourteen months' imprisonment, and at the end of every month
to be publicly well whipped.
Or, would it not rejoice your eyesight to see this P—
BEERDRINKERS BEWARE! Whereas James Artjttl Dodger,
Publican, of Slimehouse, has been convicted of the crime of selling salt
and water, mixed with treacle and nux vomica, in lieu of wholesome beer, his
licence is suspended for the term of Seven Years, during his confinement
with hard labour in the gaol of Cold Bath Fields.
And what terribly wry faces would some chemists make at seeing
an advertisement like this :—
NO MORE PILLS NOR ANY OTHER MEDICINE can be pur-
chased for the present at the shop of Arel Druooek, adulterating chemist,
31, Dead Swindle Street. This dishonest tradesman, having been convicted,
for the second time, of exposing for sale adulterated drugs, has been condemned
to forfeit his whole stock in trade, and publicly to swallow six-and-twenty
doses of it, one a week in the next six months, in the pillory erected opposite
his shop.

very heartily indeed that you may get it,
Believe me, Yours, in envy,

We only want to hold our own, not that of any other man.
'Tis hard that we, whose policy is peace in simple purity,
Are bloated armaments obliged to keep up for security.
O, O, 0! &c.
In foreign strifes our aim is to maintain a strict neutrality,
And 'twixt belligerents preserve complete impartiality.
Meanwhile our neighbours gnash their teeth, and grin at us, and frown
upon us,
And so we are obliged to arm for fear they should be down upon us.
0,0,0! &c.
The soldier's life is durance, and the soldier's lot privation is,
His death's an execution, and st ill worse his mutilation is.
Yet men must for their country fight with steadiness and bravery,
As soldiers lest a conqueror should make them serve in slavery.
O, O, O! See.
To war •for glory foreigners go, some content to die for it;
Fight we that we may not be forced to fight when we wouldifly from it.
As flying is not always quite as safe as 'tis inglorious,
We must arm so that if we mnst fight we may be victorious.

producing a net income of £2000 a-year. Superior family residence, with
suitable offices and grounds. The incumbent is aged 72. Sole charge, and
house may be arranged for. Full particulars of Mr. &c.
An incumbent of a rectory may be aged seventy-two, but if the
rectory is a valuable one, he may live to be a great deal older. When
a living yields £2000 a-year, its incumbent may continue to enjoy life
in it, till he is eighty-two, or even ninety-two; there is, at least, one
existing dean who is past ninety-two. To let one know whether a
living to be sold is worth inquiring after, the proprietor should adver-
tise particulars respecting the incumbent's health. It would save me
trouble if 1 were informed whether or no the clergyman of seventy-two
above referred to is asthmatic or dropsical as well as aged, and 1 want
to be furnished with a surgical report, on stethoscopical examination,
of the state of his lungs and heart. To purchase a living in the dark
as to those vital details is to buy a pig in a poke, viridity of which, if I

Mr. Punch thought, and the world thought also, that he understood
everything. But he frankly owns himself floored, so to speak, by the

who wish to take or let lodgings:—

Country Apartments, consisting of 2 Sitting and 3 Bed-rooms, in a nice
Detached House, &c. There muat be no other Lodgers, or Children in the

This is really one of the things that come under the rule laid down
by Mr. Sothern, as Lord Dundreary. If we only knew the apartments
which this remarkable family intends to take, and if the distance does
not exceed the ride mentioned, we would go to the expense of a return

THE PENAL ECONOMY OF THE FUTUBE.
India, or part of India, is blessed with a certain "Whipping Act"
passed with a view to save the honest part of the community the ex-
pense of keeping rogues and thieves in gaol. In places, owing to
prevalent effusion of the milk-and-water of human kindness on the
brain, this salutary enactment has not been enforced with the rigour
necessary to the attainment of its object. Therefore the Lieutenant
Governor of the district comprising the gaols in the Dacca and Chitta-
gong Divisions has, according to the Bombay Gazette, issued a minute,
of which every Magistrate in the division is to be furnished with a copy.
This masterlv State Paper of the local Executive admonishes those to
whom it is
"As the Whipping Aot was passed by the Legislature avowedly for the
purpose of relieving the gaols of overcrowding, the Lieutenant-Governor,
without in any way wishing to interfere with the discretion of judicial
officers, or to dictate to them the punishments they are to award, thinks that
it is the duty of Kagietrates to put aside any personal feeling they may enter-
tain regarding the punishment of whipping, and use more freely in all proper
cases the power the law places in their hands without reference to sentiment
or prejudice."
It is to be hoped that unenlightened humanity will not prevent
Indian Magistrates from accepting this very polite invitation to do
their duty, and spare honest people taxation by not sparing rogues the
cat-o'-nine-tails. Thereunto their minds may need some strengthening,
which should be derived from the remainder of the Lieutenant-Gover-
nor's minute; a gem and model, in its way, of didactic remark:—
"The punishment of whipping, if properly administered, is a very severe
and deterrent one, and its more frequent use, combined with a judicious
resort to the punishment of fine, in lieu of simple imprisonment, would no
doubt prevent the overcrowding of gaols, which is now so general throughout
Bengal, and release Government, from the difficulty and expense of providing
additional prison accommodation."
Such, unquestionably, is the desirable effect which "the pun-
ishment of whipping" would produce in England also, no less than
in India "if properly administered." That proviso is material, and
should be remembered by the justioes who preside over our prisons, and
with whom it rests to make arrangements for the correction of
garotters. If the punishment of whipping were thus always rendered
a very severe and deterrent one," economy suggests that " its more
frequent use," legalised by extension to all manner of rogues, thieves,
and other base criminals, would be at least a great advantage to the
rate-payer. Whipping-cheer for convicts is much cheaper than a long
course of even prison fare, which costs more than workhouse diet; and
crime surely deserves a heavier punishment than poverty, instead of
being rewarded with prison "accommodation." The chastisement
which has diminished garotting would doubtless likewise diminish
stealing and fraud: adulteration, for example, and the use of false
weights and measures. Should any one of our playwrights shortly
produce a drama, of which the plot hinges on felony, and a thief
is the hero, perhaps he will have the good sense to append to it, by
way of "tag" the admirable observations above-quoted on the
punishment of whipping."
Remarking on the present
Europe, the Times very justly says:—
in relation to
"In our own case Empire has yielded to fusion, and all the various metals
of which society is here composed are now in the furnace."
Let us be thankful, however, that England is not too hot to hold
more than certain persons, and consider that, if Empire has here ended
in fusion, it might, as it has elsewhere, have had a worse end. In a
neighbouring nation Empire has ended in confusion.

EXTRACTS FROM MY COMMON-PLACE BOOK.
(N.B. The Authorities will be left till called for.
)
Michaelmas Dat! The recurrence of this monastic festival brings
to the recollection of the student and the poulterer many curious cus-
toms connected with its observance which are still kept up in certain
counties in England and Wales.
In the Channel Islands the inhabitants go to sleep for an hour in
the middle of the day, and then walk through the principal streets in
procession, the municipal authorities escorting to the Town Hall three
geese, having their beaks and feet highly gilt, and wreaths of purple
asters suspended round their necks. The bells ring a merry peal, and
the Vestry Clerk, in wig and gown and a cocked hat, scatters twenty-
nine new silver pennies among the crowd from the Church pinnacles.
The geese are cooked the same afternoon with a stuffing peculiar to
the country, consisting of bread crumbs, carraway seeds, and apple
parings mixed together in unequal proportions, and flavoured with
cowslip wine, and the birds are sent, through the churchwardens, to
the three best looking widows not being in the receipt of parochial
relief, who can prove they have money in the Post Office pillar-box.
On the Border, on this day, Hercules Sampson's benefaction,
bequeathed by Will in the reign of Edward the Seventh, is distri-
buted by the Mayor and Corporation, in their official robes, to every
poor child born within live miles of the parish stocks, who can repeat
the names of the Kings of England in order from the Conquest, and say
the Thirty-Nine Articles. The Benefaction consists of a small tureen
of. apple-sauce stuck with cloves, and a penny loaf sprinkled with pow-
dered lump sugar, bearing the initials "H. S." in the centre in pink
comfits, and is derived from the rent of a large meadow, known by the
name of the Michaelmas goose pasture.
In the Fens, the day is observed as a general holiday, the shops are
closed, the streets are swept, the fire engines parade the town, and
every voter paying Income-Tax is entitled to a free pass in a balloon,
to all the places of interest in the neighbourhood, with the option of
returning any Wednesday after luncheon. The burgesses go about in
their best clothes, carrying goose-quills behind the left ear, dyed in
various colours, green preponderating, and, at night a bonfire is made
of these in the Market Place, followed by a Ball and Supper in the
Public Booms, tickets one-and-a-penny-halfpenny, including cough
lozenges.
Some persons carry punctuality to such an extent that it becomes
a vice. People bringing little bills are flagrant instances of this.
No age, no country, no rank, no profession, no monthly magazine,
no old county family, is without its well authenticated ghost story.
The Stopperleigh-Whopperleigh one is, perhaps, not sufficiently known,
and yet it has been handed down through successive generations of
parish-clerks with material variations. Once a year, about the end of
harvest, just before dawn on a windy morning, a dead cook, in a
turban and flannel dressing-gown, traverses stealthily the principal
corridors of the Castle, goes down the front staircase, muttering to
herself and somebody else, and is distinctly heard to weep over the
dripping in the back-kitchen. She then, after an interval of perfect
silence, washes her hands at the sink, without moving a muscle or
betraying her secret, and retraces her steps, by the way she came, to
her own chamber, the door of which she closes with unnecessary
violence. A subdued roll, like muffled drums, is heard for seven
minutes, when it suddenly ceases at the sound of the stable-clock
striking the hour. The family do not retire to rest on this night, and
the superintendent of county police is accommodated with a bed in the
bntlers pantry. There is no clue to the story, but the thread of the
narrative has never been broken, except once during Lord North's
administration.
There is a tradition in the Trerarvon family that a white gull, with one
wing broken, dashes against the blue bed-room window at 2 a.m. when-
ever the head of the family is about to contract a foolish marriage; but,
strangely enough, the County History is silent as to the mysterious
footmarks which invariably appear in the shrubbery, when the peaches
are ripe on the South wall.
In the Wolds, the country people, to a man and a woman, firmly
believe in the existence of the "Grey Lady," who rides straight
through all the locked turnpike gates, at midnight on the last Saturday
in the season (if the weather is stormy), dressed in a scarlet habit
trimmed with black bombazine, and followed by a brindled dog, wearing
a gold collar engraved with her initials, which always disappears
before the servants are up in the morning. The Jady blows a horn, and
has no near relations.
The dull stain of blood on the floor of the billiard-room at "Gallantry
Bower," the ancestral seat of the Earls of Otterington, in the
North Biding of Yorkshire, has never been effaced by the most indus-
trious housemaid, and bids fair to defy time and every known deter-
gent. There is a dark story connected with it. Late one night, in
midwinter, when the snow lay thick on the ground, the humpbacked
marker, who was the foster-brother of the fifteenth Earl (Gilrert
"the gaunt"), fell into an angry altercation with a guest of venerable
appearance who had only arrived that evening in a violent shower of
rain, and dealt him a heavy blow, which proved fatal to his tinted
spectacles, and left him with—a bloody nose. A false tooth was picked
up the following day by the detective police, who were engaged to
investigate the affair, but the stranger had disappeared in a return
chaise, and the marker, after a short seclusion at Notting Hill Gate,
resumed his official duties, but was never known to taste asparagus
again.
PLEASANTRY OF IRISH PAPERS.
The Fenian Irish newspapers, calling themselves national, affect to
taunt the British Government with inconsistency in admitting the
inefficiency of standing armies for national defence, and yet not letting
the Irish people arm and defend themselves. Does the favourite colour
of the Fenians tinge their vision so completely as to make them imagine
that they see a lot of it in the eye of Britannia P Because, of course,
they mean what they imply. In all that sincerity which is so charac-
teristic of a certain class of Irishmen, they intend it to be understood
that they wish the Irish people were suffered to arm themselves with
a view to self-defence against Continental, or perhaps American in-
vasion—who knows? There was a memorable occasion:—
"When Malachi wore the collar of gold
He won from the proud invader."
Our Fenian contemporaries would wish us assured that, in the event
of the United Kingdom being at war, and a foreign inroad having been
attempted on Ireland, they would be gratified by the spectacle of an
Irish Volunteer wearing such another ornament as that exhibited by
Malachi, and wearing also the Victoria Cross.
The British Government, however, has a very excellent reason for
not sanctioning any Volunteer movement in Ireland. There is not the
least occasion for any such thing. No nation in all Europe will ever
dream of invading that beautiful island with any view of annexing it,
and undertaking the government of its inhabitants. But if the Irish
were armed, circumstances might occur under which Ireland would be
invaded with another object, not of course contemplated by Fenian
journalists.
THE WAR AND THE VINE.
So near the wasteful battle plain,
What will become of the Champagne P
Good news from Bollinger's at Ay
Will your anxiety allay.
The German warriors nought impede
The vintage, but protect and speed.
Bless the right valiant German troops!
They are from being nincompoops
A distance very much too far
The making of Champagne to mar.
No such teetotallers are they.
Ours might be mischievous at Ay,
But Germans reverence the vine—
Nor, bent to harm it, crossed the Rhine.
GLORY AND BOOTS.
In this country at least it may be hoped that civilisation has not
been thrown back by the War. That calamity appears not yet to have
aroused vulgar admiration of conquerors.^ As yet we have seen no
manifestations of the Snob's Hero Worship. Tune was when a suc-
cessful General was sure to have his name applied, in token of reverence
for him, to some new form of clothing for the lower extremities. Such
articles of apparel were called " Wellingtons " and " Bluchers " in other
days; and even lately, when the Emperor, or Ex-Emperor, of the
French was in his glory, a certain kind of them was styled Napo-
leons." But hitherto no son of St. Crispin has given any of the names
of the Prussian Generals to the specialities of his stock-in-trade. In
the shop-windows of that trade we have seen no tickets offering
"Williams" or "Crown Princes," or "Von Moltkes," at so much a
pair;. nor have we, up to the present time, noticed any similar recom-
mendation of " Bismarcks," meaning boots.
Quite Uncalled For.
At the singular cross examination through which civic politeness
put Mr. Dakin, the Lord Mayor Elect, it was urged that a Mayor
ought to be able to promote Exhibitions. The remark was superfluous,
Mr. Dakin being a Spectacle-maker.

WAK NEWS.
(From your Own Cockalorum.)
Drarest Cockalorum,
With all the news, and everybody preciously bustled, I 've been
nobody, the Hereditary Grand and the Crown Cockalorum all over the
shop, and your light-hearted Militaire only a little Jack-in-the-cart.
However, times is beginning to change, and your Own will be in
the hunt again.
Did you get my letter last week P If you didn't, it was tucked up
on the road, and its words of wisdom translated by some unfriendly
grenadier. They're on to my letters to you like a mouse on cheese,
and ain't dictionaries riz since they got hold of some o' this noble
Marquis's correspondence, and tried their gentle hands at translations.
Which it were.
You see they know I'm here, and they know that I'm a gay soldier, up
to fortifications, and positions, strategies, and the whole bag of tricks.
If I liked to let out the wheres and whyfors I might put 'em in a hole.
But that ain't this true Your Own's game. The Generous Gee has
come to grief. The noble aud illustrious Transcendancy, Count, or
Baron, Motolke, took a fancy to him. "Quiet P" says he. "Lamb-
like, your Washup," says I. "Terms so much," says I, "and no
reduction on taking a quantity." "Done!" says he. Yours ever,"
says I, and in another moment the Heavy Veteran was squared. He
comes back to ask, "Quiet in harness P" "Won't warrant him
that," says I, for you see I'd collared the ready; "but I won't
warrant him alive, for that matter," I added, just to encourage the
performance. The Bold Baron puts him into a do wn-the-road Trap— a
sort of Gig with the chill off,—and afore he'd gone half a mile, up go
Gee's heels in the air, bang goes the splash-board, and away goes the
Bold Baron over a ditch, through a hedge, and into the middle of next
week. He wanted to call me out; but this gay and crafty Warrior put
the whole affair before the Hereditary Grand, who dashed the Baron's
buttons, and ordered him into toko for venturing his precious life in
such an unsportsmanlike caper. "Yours to command," says I to the
Baron, as he walked out swearing like a Tom-cat on a water-butt.
He just gave me a look, but I met his with a stern frown as showed
him that in two twos I'd put his peepers up to the Early Closing
movement if he dared shake his jolly old nut at me. This light-
hearted Soldier is not to be trifled with; if trifled with he'1l bustle em
a bit. However, we met afterwards, and had a glass of stuff together.

An Unselfish Policy.
It is perhaps a mistake to suppose that the British Government
could iu no way depart from its policy of non-intervention in foreign
affairs, so as to satisfy belligerent nations. If British interference
were of such a nature that it obviously could not result in any conse-
quence to this country but unmitigated disaster, then possibly they
would not ascribe it to selfish motives, and might be satisfied.

POETIC TRADE INTELLIGENCE.
Dear Mr. Punch,
Having little else to do just now, I read the papers a great
deal, and by way of a relief from the horrors of the war, I delight in
the perusal of our peaceful trade intelligence. I find it far more enter-
taining than political debates; and, indeed, my poet's eye, while it rolls
in a fine phrenzy, is observant of the fact that the language used in
Commerce is not imaginative merely, but remarkably poetic. Such
phrases, for example, as "pig iron is buoyant," or ' potatoes rather
active," are surely to be traced to the imaginative faculty; and when I
hear that "wool is drooping," or that "tallow is depressed," my heart
is warmed by the poetic fire that sparkles in the words. How easy it
would be to write a trade report in rhyme, and how decided an improve-
ment would be caused by such a process, the following half dozen
stanzas may perhaps suffice to show:—
Inspired by telegraphic skill,
Or tardier postal aid,
The bard his usual space may fill
With news of foreign trade.
No tale of sentimental love
His mission is to tell:
But to record how prices move,
Where merchants buy and sell.
First then of India he will speak:
Late imports there have shown,
That madapollams are less weak,
While mulls have firmer grown.
And since per candy shipped to us
A higher rate's received,
In Dhollerah less dolorous
The trade may be believed.
American advices state
Petroleum is firm;
While breadstuff's, that were dull of late,
More lively we may term.
In cotton Middling Upland's sought
At twenty-four 'tis true,
But Middling Bowed may still be bought
As low as twenty-two.
In Norway timber, deals and tar
Is done a brisker trade,
And Swedish pigs of iron are
More buoyant by a shade.
From Russia have the tidings come
That tallow is depressed,
But both in hides and hemp is some
Activity confessed.
Colonial markets have displayed
A slightly better tone;
Molasses an advance hath made,
And spice hath vigour shown.
Fine Coloury Plantation too
(Of Coffee now we speak)
More strength exhibits, but 'tis true
That rums are rather weak.
In China black-leaf Congou still
Is found in fair demand,
Enriching those who plant with skill
In that Celestial land.
Shanghai reports affirm in sooth
Bice hath to thirty ranged,
And, what seems an unpleasant truth.
Grey shirtings are unchanged.
Without reserving to myself the copyright of this poetical invention,
which any trade reporters are at liberty to profit by, believe me,
Yours admiringly,
Longpellow Scott Southey Tennyson Pope Jones.
The European Example.
Ip the present war, with all its slaughter, and especially that which
it has brought on the aggressors, he not followed by a lasting peace,
its event will certainly prove the inefficacy of capital punishment.
A Cavalry Charger.—The Hors(e) de Combat.
HINT TO HOTEL-KEEPERS.
Mr. Punch,
The Continent not being altogether pleasant, you have, pro-
bably, been spending your holidays and your hard-earned money in the
hotels of your own country. I have, and am tolerably familiar with
the charges for apartments, fire and lights, attendance, and baths, in
the romantic district of England in which I have been travelling. My
misgivings about the bill used somewhat to interfere with my enjoy-
ment of the scenery, and I hope I shall not for some time to come see
such anxious, expectant looks as the waiters, chambermaids, porters,
and bootses would assume on the morning of my departure, when
they were in doubt whether I should be sordid enough to imagine
they were sufficiently remunerated for their laborious services by the
paltry amount entered in the bill . How relieved I always felt when
the door of the conveyance that was to take me to the Station closed
upon me, and 1 saw no more of my black-coated escort! (Boots I
did reward, for his constitution was impaired, by a box of my wife's
which happened to be of unusual dimensions.)
But I have not taken up my pen, after consuming a pint of ordi-
nary wine purveyed at an extraordinary price, to write to you on
the old subject of hotel plagues and extortions. On the contrary,
1 am in the most friendly spirit going to make what may prove
a very lucrative suggestion to all landlords, landladies, managers,
and secretaries of English, Irish, Scotch, ana Welsh Hotels. They
have, I will allow, shown infinite ingenuity in planning items and
charges, and perhaps it may be thought that there is nothing left which
could by any trick or device, short of the commission of the statutable
offence of obtaining money under false pretences, be added to the bill.
But I think I can propose something which will make that long docu-
ment a little longer; 1 fancy I can give a valuable hint to host and
hostess—one which ought to place me on the free list of every hotel in
the kingdom for the rest of my life. The British innkeeper is clever,
very clever, and ought with the most average management to die
wealthy, but he is inferior to his foreign brother in one important
respect: he is unmindful of his own interests, and neglects a large
additional revenue in not making a charge for—Soap! Let him only
do that and he will be complete.
Your obedient Servant,
The Fleece, Cockleport, Lionel Ogilvie Doreington Diers.
Michaelmas Day.
FRENCH AND ENGLISH FRATERNITY.
The Birmingham Daily Gazelle relates how Messrs. Odger and
Trant, on their return home from their mission to the Parisian Repub-
lic, were arrested at Oissel, between Elbceuf and Rouen, in the belief
that they were Prussian spies, by a multitude of French citizens, whom
our Birmingham contemporary disrespectfully calls a "mob." Accord-
ing to that journal, they were searched, their passports, letters, and
documents declared by the excited mob" to be all forged, and they
only escaped being lynched by the kind offices of a gentleman who
seemed to have some power over the people. By this account a multi-
tude of French citizens at Oissel behaved very nearly in the way wherein
that bloated calumniator of the people, Virgil, describes the public,
which he styles the ignoble vulgar, as being wont to conduct itself
when, in a state of seditious excitement, it is addressed by a respectable
man to whom it listens with cocked ears.
Having, however, been finally released,—
"Messrs. Odoer and Trant returned thanks to the officials for their
kindness, and, after three cheers for the French .Republic, proceeded on their
journey."
Some base deceiver must have hoaxed the Birmingham Dail) Gazette
with the story of MM. Odger and Trant's arrest by their French
brethren. The author of this fiction is probably some malignant con-
stitutional monarchist, who thought it a good joke to represent mob-
leaders as having been mobbed. Of course, no one who duly appre-
ciates the patriotic demonstrations in Hyde Park can for a moment
believe that instinctive fellow-feeling could allow a French multitude to
mistake MM. Trant and Odger for Prussian spies. The only credible
part of the tale referred to is its conclusion. Very likely Odger
and Trant did give three cheers for the French Republic. Possibly
they are prepared to give the same reasons for the establishment of
an English one.
Practical Infallibility.
Ultramontane philosophers contend that the Pope has no right to
renounce his temporal power unless all the Roman Catholic Bishops in
the world agree to let him. They forget their own belief that those
very Bishops in Council have just declared him to be the infallible
I judge of right and wrong.
A Rough Wine.—Rude-sheimer.

BETTER DAYS.
SlB,
I relong to that body of gentlemen who are the real support
of the Drama, and have appeared at different times and different places
as a nobleman, a brigand (in the same piece), a guest, a policeman, a
soldier, an attendant (with no particular official duty in the Castle
except to bring a letter to the first walking gentleman, on a silver
salver), a happy peasant, a rebellious peasant, a drinking peasant (with
a line in a chorus), a guard, with a large head (and no extra pay for
being half stifled), in a pantomime, not to mention a demon, and a man
in a boat (not exactly a boatman, and I don't know what I was sup-
posed to be doing), and, Sir, I am aware that we are ridiculed as Supers,
a vulgar shortening for "supernumeraries." Sir, Mr. Chattehton,
who so ably manages Drury Lane, and gives a livelihood to many
families belonging to noblemen, guards, pages, courtiers, &c, has nobly
come forward in our defence, and in his advertisement he drops the
name of supers, and calls us
AUXILIARIES.
The new piece, says he, is supported by the principals and "300
auxiliaries."
This, Sir, is the way to go to battle. Distinguished by such an honour-
able title, Mr. F. B. C's corps of Auxiliaries will fight for him bravely,
and be happy to stand up for him on each side of the stage (as I and
my gallant companions in arms do every night) as Beefeaters, with now.
Sir, as Christmas comes on, a chance of eating real beef with our
female and infantine auxiliaries who perform in our private domestic
dramr. I don't write this myself, but get a friend to do it for me; but
I am, Sir, Yours ever obediently.
A Satisfied Super, or, I should say,
An 'Appt Auxiliary.
P.S. Look out for me on the r. h. side of stage, facing audience. I
am that beefeater. Ask Mr. Chatterton to add to his kindness by
giving me padding for my calves, as 1 regret to say unkind remarks
have reached me from the stalls below relative to the meagre appearance
of my understandings. I pity the gents who make these remarks, but
still I am as Nature made me. Dou't forget. Beefeater, u. H. side, in
the scene where the nobles and courtiers are r. and l., and the ladies
of the ballet do a dance.
HEADS AND TALES.
Here is a theory which you may find time to think about when next
you get your hair cut :—
"No feature seems so liable to change among whole nations, and to be so
much a matter of chance in particular families, as the colour of the hair."
Granting hair to be a feature, we may in some degree admit the
truth of these assertions; although, in persons who are not teetotallers,
the nose is certainly a feature quite as liable to change its colour as the
hair. But we doubt if it be true that in particular families the colour
of the hair is "so much a matter of chance" as seems to be supposed.
If we may believe the tales that have been told us, we should say that
persons who are most particular, that is in the matter of their personal
appearance, have purposely a recourse to anything but chance for
effecting changes in the colour of their hair. One can hardly call it
chance that takes a lady to a hairdresser, and there makes her the pur-
chaser of certain dyes and washes, concocted for the object of imparting
to her hair what she conceives to be a fashionable colour. Such
purchases are made for the purpose of increasing; her capillary attrac-
tions; but although a fashionable colour be obtained, we doubt if she
could plead a colourable excuse for it.
New Reading.
A Veteran French Statesman has lately been very energetic in
visiting foreign Courts. Tennyson's Tears, idle Tears, might now
with propriety run, Thiers, busy Thiers.

who has not yet issued from
his apartment. Gooch &
Co. nope anxiously that
Maullie will have some
regard to social require-
ments, and not inflict upon ns his "tourist's complete suit of
dittos and white wide-awake. Maullie enters. Grand l and start-
ling effect. Latest thing in summer clothing. Black frock coat,
white waistcoat, brilliant trousers, polished boots, check necktie,
snowy collars, flannel shirt apparent beneath (" Why can't he go
the whole animal P" complains Gooch, who is down upon the blot
at once), disappearing behind his waistcoat and coat, and turning
up again at the wristbands. Taken altogether, Maullie is in go-
to-meet in' costume, and is justly proud of the surprise which he has
given us.
"Now," says Gooch, "where is your hatP" Then Maullie pro-
duces a '' gibus," and exclaims, "There!" triumphantly.
"Put it on," says Gooch.
He puts it on, turning his profile, right side, towards us. Applause.
Gooch cunningly walks round him, and stops, in horror, on the left.
He has found out the weak point of the " gibua." Maullie's counte-
nance falls. "Yes," he admits, " the spring is a little gone on one
side, but I don't think it '11 be noticed."
"Not noticed!" exclaims Gooch, while Muntlet and Fiston
laugh derisively.
My dear fellow," continues the Count, "this is hfete day. There
are two bands playing in the Gardens: tout le monde et safemme will be
there in the height of Parisian fashion. You can't escape remark."
Maullie thinks he can. He defends his hat. Bund, being impa-
tient to go into the gardens, and near the concert (he looks forward to
something cheery on the violoncello), says, "O never mind his hat!—
come along!"
Gooch sacrifices himself for the reputation of the Club's first ap-
pearance in Brussels. He announces his intention of walking with
Maullie, adopting an idea of Muntley's (who knows something about
theatrical effect), and keeping his companion with his bright side
towards the audience (as it were), and his shady side towards himself.
The audience being seated in the gardens, this plan is found to
answer; but Maullie, happening to get free for a few moments,
takes the wrong side of Gooch, who, momentarily oblivious of the
change, is talking to Muntlet on his other arm, and at once becomes the
cynosure of neighbouring eyes. "What a hat!" "Regard, my dear,
that hat!" "How it is droll, that hat!" we cannot help hearing, and
even Maullie is induced to recognise the fact that he is bearding
Society to its very face. He joins Bund, who has found out a secluded
restaurant in the gardens, and is icing himself.
After two hours' promenade, Jomp appears at the gates with a gor-
geous carriage.
"Is it." asks Gooch, who likes to do everything in its proper
season, the right time for driving in the Bois P
"O yes," replies Jomp, "you can drive in the Bois—O yes!" as if,
after mature reflection, he, personally, knew of no just cause or impedi-
ment to such a proceeding.
"But," persists Gooch (for Gooch & Co.), "is it the time when all
the swells—all the swell equipages—drive out P Eh P"
"Dey all drive out," Jomp returns. "0 yes—um—um—dey all drive
out now—um—um—as much at at any oder time"
Carried, for the hundredth time, Jomp is an ass. *
We drive into the new and unfinished Bois. It will be undoubtedly
very beautiful—it is certainly very dusty. So dusty that after a time,
and in one part of the drive, we cannot see anything three yards a-head
of us. All consequently in bad temper, except Secretary and Gooch
who happen to be seated with their backs to the horses. Jomp
smothered; Bund and Maullie as if they'd been left for months on
a shelf without being touched. Muntlet and Finton, in the rumble,
grimy and using strong language, chiefly French, and very bad
French too.
We encounter two carriages besides ours. This represents Du Monde
out (1 riving in the Bois.
Gooch is very angry. "Confound it, Jomp," he exclaims, "they
don't drive out here at this time, you see."
"No," answers Jomp, shrugging his shoulders," um-nm-def do not."
"Perhaps," suggests Maullie, we've come to the wrong place."
Jomp has nothing to meet this with, except another shrug, as if
acknowledging that this may be the case.
"Is there no other drive't" asks Bund of the Coachman.
"O yes, all round the town. Drive wherever Monsieur likes."
"Then," says Bund, resignedly, "drive all round the town." A
simple means of coming upon the fashionable rendezvous at some point
or another.
We determine (after our drive) to dine at the table d'hote. Gooch
protests, but yields to majority. Places taken. Dinner at a com-
paratively early hour, to allow of going to theatre. Gooch selects two
theatres: one where there is a Diablerie piece announced, and another
where Le Petit Faust is being done, the airs of which Muntley and
Finton immediately commence to whistle or hum, more or less in-
correctly. In view of an opera bouffe, and a French melodrame, they
are in high spirits.
Bund hears that there are concerts in the evening after the theatres,
and foresees the chance of taking back some new solo pieces for his
violoncello. Maullie visits photograph shops, and buys views.
Jomp, at liberty, employs his time in a manner most useful to a
courrier. Being unacquainted witl"
the occasion by standing in front
nothing except joining in an occasional
"Why don't you go and see the town P" asks Maullie.
"O veil," answers Jomp, smiling at the absurdity of such an idea
"Dere is nothing here—um—um—all towns is de same."
And so they are—to Jomp.
3 lime m a manner most useiui to v.
with Brussels, he contrives to improve
ront of the hotel-door all day, doing
icasional chat with the landlord.
SCORNED AND HATED JOHN BULL.
What fun it is to read the abuse which some foreigners are
accustomed to heap upon us English because of our determination not
to allow ourselves to be involved in war, if we can help it, by any
sympathy felt, how sincerely soever, for them under calamities which
they have brought upon themselves by their unreasoning passions!
That abuse is peculiar. It is the language of contemptuous but bitter
hatred, and exactly resembles that in which improvident blackguards
in private life are in the habit of sneering at their prudent and upright
relations and neighbours, who succeed, by the constant exercise of
care, forethought, and persevering conscientiousness, in keeping out of
difficulties which are continually befalling foolish rogues. Monkeys,
indeed, do not speak, but there is a baboonish grotesqueness in vitu-
peration which discloses an utter deficiency of moral sense.
A PUMP-BIDDEN PROVINCE.
In one of the reports of the twaddle talked by the gentlemen of the
platform at the Social Science Association occurs the title of a paper
read by the Rev. Dawson Burns, M.A„ liquor law agitator, on
"The Province of Local Option in respect to the Sale of Intoxicating
Liquors." Mr. Burns is a member of the party of meddlers who want
the Legislature to empower them to abolish the liquor-trade in every
district wherein they can contrive, by their harangues and machinations,
to command a majority in favour of priggish tyranny. If he and
his associates ever succeed in their endeavour to deprive people of
beer, we trust that their success will be limited to the Province of
Local Option, wherever that may be, and that liberty to drink or not
to drink whatsoever we please will remain unimpaired in every one of
all the provinces of the United Kingdom.
Eh? M. Jules Favre?
He, who refused such Armistyce
As hardly would be offered twice,
Took (though no fool) a fool's advice.
LUCKILY, A MISTAKE.
Mrs. Malaprop has a favourite comic actor. She was, therefore, in
a sad way when she heard of "The Capture of Toole," and wondered
why he would go to the theatre of war.

The Cats' Paradise.—The Mew Stone.
This new institution of the country was "inaugurated" on Saturday
morning last by Mr. Punch himself, who, precisely at nine o'clock,
posted with his own hand to a Favoured Correspondent one of the new
missiles, inscribed
"We must apeak by the Card."—Shakspkarr.
After this imposing ceremony, Mr. Punch returned to his office, and
in a glass of Seltzer—not quite colourless—he drank to the healths of
Lord Hahtington and Mr. Scudamore.
He now proceeds to give notice that he wishes to receive no communi-
cation whatsoever that is written upon a card; and further, that if any
printed circular, or puff, so written, manage to come into his august
hands, he will forthwith denounce the sender thereof, and his wares,
in such a way as will effectually debar the pensive public from patron-
ising the impertinent advertiser.
Nextly, he suggests that his young friends who desire to use the
cards among themselves, but do not desire that all the world should
understand the messages, had better devise a language for the purpose
of concealing their ideas. He thinks that the exquisite Anglo-French,
of which specimens have been given in his pages, would be an advan-
tageous medium.
For instance. He supposes the case of a young gentleman who has
been in trouble, and wishes his more respectable brother to intercede
with their honoured parent fbr supplies, which denied, the supplicant
must enlist.
"Le gourernear est dans une cire tonnante, mais auoune matiere. Allez
appelrrsur lui immediatement, et dites lui que a'il nefourchette pas en dehors,
je vcux Otre aouffle ai je ne prenda pas la piece de 21 sous! Ainai maintenant."
Or thus, when a more tender message is sent:—
"0 rongcontry, rongcontry moi dong le awarry,
Cong la fleur, la fleur ay aewer le pas droit.
A SCENE IN ST. PETER'S.
The Morning PosCs Own Correspondent at Rome saw the Pope the
other day passing up the nave to St. Peter's.' He says :—
"I heard some of the lower orders among the congregation ery out as the
Popr passed, 'Santo padre! non ei lasciarete, starete eon not!" (Holy
Father! you will not leave ua, you will atay with ua.) To which hia Holiness
replied, 'Non abbiate timore, figli, che non vi lasciero mat.' (Fear not, my
children, I will never leave you.)"
The foregoing colloquy between the Pope and his sympathising
subjects ought to be preserved in the original language. To be sure
we have often enough heard something like it in Italian operas; bnt,
for the sake of historical accuracy, it is desirable that the exact words
should be recorded in order that they may be introduced into the
libretto of an opera seria hereafter to be composed bv some competent
master on the subject of the Italian acquisition of Rome. As it was,
one cannot help imagining that the people in St. Peter's addressed the
Pope in a chorus, and that his Holiness replied to them in an air, or at
least in recitative.
To Correspondents.
Mr. Punch begs leave to say that he receives numerous communi-
cations (supposed, by the authors, to be of a jocular sort) which he is
asked to insert on the ground that the guerdon he may bestow in
return will be sent to the Sick and Wounded Fund. Having shown
his own feelings in regard to that Fund by a Cartoon which set
the nation thinking of its duty to the unfortunate French and Germans,
he is entitled to remember his own duty towards English-reading
people. He has no intention of making them Sick, or of Wounding
their feelings, by the insertion of bad jokes forwarded by Cheek in
the mask of Charity.

THE PROPHETIC DOCTOB.
(Not Cumming but Manning.)
In a recently reported Sermon by Dr. Manning, instituting a com-
parison, not at all after the manner of Plutarch, between Victor-
Emmanuel and Pontius Pilate, occurs the statement that :—
"Forty-five Pontifis had either been driven out of Rome, or had never set
their feet in it."
But nevertheless, quoth the Titular :—
"Despite all theso diaaeten, the Church has ever been victorious, and
would be so again and again, and history told them that no one who had ever
laid hands upon her prospered."
No one P How about one Henry tee Eighth, of England, and
said Henri's kingdom P Or did Henry not prosper, nor his kingdom
neither, or did he not, indeed, when he dissolved the monasteries, lay
hands upon Dr. Manning's ChurchP Or shall we say that bluff
King Hal, and hitherto comparatively prosperous England, constitute
the exception which proves a rule, the rale having been exemplified by
the fate of the ancient Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the
Goths and Vandals, the Lombards, the Normans, the German Empire,
and Napoleon the First; they all having warred against the Holy
See and the Sovereign Pontiff, and each having "been punished for
the sacrilege"P Are we to suppose that when Dr. Manning said
that, he spoke from acquaintance with the world's moral government,
or that he is bold enough to declare from the pulpit, as a truth, that
which he does not know to be true P At any rate when he added, and
so it would be in this case," his prescience may be safely credited with
correspondence to his veracity.
An Italian journalist, some few years ago, drew up and published a
list of Personages and Powers, and Governments whom the Pope had
solemnly blessed, and of whom every one had subsequently come to
grief. These cases were cited as curious coincidences with reference

to the Italian superstition that his dear old Holiness is a gettatore, so
tbat his blessings have the effect of curses. _ Victor-Emmanuel,
though an Italian, is not superstitious, or he might now be in some
fear lest peradventure the Holy Father should bless him, as he blessed
the ex-KiNG of Naples, the ex-QueEN o; Spain, and other dethroned
sovereigns. There they are after their blessing, whether in consequence
of it or not, dethroned. If the King op Italy regarded omens, he
could have reason to say to the Pope, "Don't bless me, Holy Father,
whatever you do!" But how much or little soever the Pope's ana-
thema, on the one hand, or his benediction on the other, may be worth,
thus much must certainly be conceded to Dr. Manning. Whosoever
shall lay bands, though with the lightest touch, upon the Holy See, in
the least particular of its temporalities even, will inevitably incur the
doom which awaits everybody who pricks his little finger; as one
schoolboy tells another, he will be sure to die after it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
E have not had
an Evening from
Home for some
considerable time,
so we looked about
for an entertain-
ment which should
afford us some real
amusement. We
selected the Hol-
born on the first
night of a new
piece, being led
thereto by the pro-
mise of fun held
out to ns in the
announcement
that the said drama,
entitled The Odds,
was from the pen
of that well-known
humorist, Mr.Sef-
ton Parry, the
highly respected
Manager of the
Holbor n Theatre.
This, in itself
being an exquisite
joke by way of
preface or introduction, we determined upon paying our money and
taking oar choice of seats; which plan we carried out literally, for
having paid our money we chose somebody else's seat, and sat in it
the whole evening. We will now proceed to give the "action" on
the stage, and, wbere necessary, in the auditorium, according to our
custom made and provided, merely premising that having, since this
memorable night,, lost our play-bill, we are obliged to trust in a great
measure to our very excellent memory for names of dramatis person*
and regular order of scenes, matters, however, of very small moment,
as neatness of construction, and happy nomenclature, are with Mr.
Sefton Parry less an object than plenty of big-drum and pantomime
bustle.
The piece was'called (and so was the author, by the way, this being
all part of the joke)
THE ODDS,
OR, WHAT THEY WEAR AND WHAT THEY COST.
**• We won't swear to the accuracy of the second title (in fact we rather
think in the absence of our play-bill, that this wasn't it), but it
would serve as a humorous reference to the costumes of the Military
and two or three of the Civilians. By the way, we must bear in
mind that the piece is styled "A Military and Sporting Dramr."
ACT L
Buzz of excitement in the Auditorium, not allayed, but perhaps rather
increased by the Curtain rising and discovering—
Scene 1.—Hon. Tom Sniffles's Chambers.
N.B. Name of Gentleman entirely from memory, not warranted cor-
rect; but our impression is that it was Sniffles; if not, he looked it
every bit, and it ought to have been.
Buzz of excitement in Auditorium. Characters, (Sniffles, and a Young
Lady as a tiger) on stage, inaudible. Pantomime for five minutes,
without the big heads.
Sniffles (walks about, then scowls upwards at the gallery, with the air
of a man who is picking out his man above, in order to nod to him).
That BUI.
[_Several persons in stalls turn round, and also loot up towards the
gallery. No Bill taking notice of Sniffles's address, they
resume their attitudes, and attend once more to Sniffles.
Enter a Chevalier (d Industrie, to judge by the flashiness of his "exterior,"
which is evidently modtlled on that of " the swell" in the pantomime)
who fusses about like the Conventional stage Frenchman of farce-life,
making mistakes in broken English, and helping to perpetuate all
the absurd old traditions of the character. He gets all "his laughs,"
and exit, pleased.
Enter a ponderous Young Man in a flaxen wig and a moustaclte, looking
uncommouly like a pleaiant young German, fresh from taking air
and exercise on a Trombone. He is supposed to be a heavy dragoon:
there is no doubt whatever about his heaviness at all events, whatever
we may think of the chances against his being a soldier. How-
ever, ai this is a military drama, why, hang it, you must have some
military in it.
Captain Pudding (we forget his name, but this will convey the idea).
The bill is forged. (Sniffles, that wicked Sniffles, laughs.) What will
my father say P Because I've never forged very much, and they're
unaccustomed to this sort of tiling at home. (Sniffles, that double-
dye'd scoundrel Sniffles, laughs) I'm going to ride Flying-Scud-in-
the-Box at our steeple-chases, and he must win. I'm the only fellow
who can ride that horse.
[After giving out this artful hint of what the plot is going to be,
exit Captain Pudding.
Sniffles. (This infernal scoundrel, Sniffles f) I see. He mustn't ride
Flying-Scud-in-the-Box. I've bet against him. I'1l have him arrested,
and I '11 meet (scowling upwards at gallery once more) that Bill.
[Exit this tremendous swindler Sniffles.
Person in Stalls (a little deaf). What's this about a bill, eh P
Friend (who has followed the plot closely up to this point). Don't know.
Scene 2.—Somewhere about Canterbury, Probably a well-known locality,
ouly as we asked several people, and they didn't recognise it, it
probably wasn't.
The Military and Sporting" elements of the Dramr. Three
in undress.
Volunteer (in stalls eager for infor nation). What are those fellows P
Regular (his Friend). Aw—'pou my soul—(puzzled)—well, I don't ex-
actly know. SpursP—yass—strapsP No—ah! they can't be cavalry.
And, ah—shirt-collars P—yes—shirt-collars, only worn in Navy. Forage
cap P hum: 'spose it's meant for officer's forage cap. Let's see (sums
up) spurs, no straps, and stick-up collars—O—of course—Horse
Marines. (Verdict accepted. Horse Marines certaiuly. As Miss
Bishop plays one of them, we ought perhaps to distinguish between the
Horse Marine, masculine, and the Horse Merino, feminine. N.B. Miss
Bishop played exceedingly well )
Here followed a Scene of little pleasantries between the Horse
Marines aforesaid and a ieading Barmaid from Messrs. Spiers and
Pond's. N.B. The name of this firm either mentioned, or written,
comes into nearly every scene. It might be called a Military Sporting
and Refreshment-rooming Dramr. Nothing particular in the scene.
Scene 3.—Home of the Puddings. Father Pudding at ter. Miss
Lavinia (an old maid by the kind permission of various farces)
talking. Tilly Price, the heroine and a sort of a relation (we
suppose) to the Puddings, working.
*»* Understand, Pudding is not the name, but the old gentleman
here is the father of Captain Pudding.
Enter Horse Marines, two English and one Irish, and the Horse Merino.
Enter Captain Pudding, with that incorrigible ruffian Sniffles.
Enter also the French Chevalier, probably after the spoons.
Tilly (to Captain Pudding, whom she loves). You '11 win on Flying-
Scud-m-the-Box.
Captain Pudding. Yes. (Sentimentally.) I took her out this morning
and showed her the brook. She arched her pretty back, wagged her
silken tail, pawed her ears in her old playful style, shook her right
fetlock joint knowingly at me, and while the thrush in her foot sang its
morning carol, 1 felt certain that Flying-Scud-in-the-Box must win.
Sniffles (aside—this treacherous Sniffles). Fool!
Maid (to Captain Pudding). A telegram, Sir, by post.
Captain Pudding (speaking through soft music). I must go. (The
Marines, and everyone present, strike attitudes all round the tea-table.)
Father Pudding (maudlin after the twentieth cup). My boy—why—
what—(Drinks somebody else's tea without sugar and faints).
Sniffles (scowling as before at the gallery—cruel and artful Sniffles).
That Bill! [End of Act.
ACT II.
General rule, until we come to Tim situation seems to be, "when the
dialogue gets tedious, hustle the Frenchman." When there's no
Frenchman and no dialogue, play the big drum, hard.
Military Life in Barracks. Colonel over tea and shrimps previous to
riding a Steeple-Chace. Officers in fancy costumes as jockeys. All
hustle the French gentleman.
The Scene.—The Race Course of a very serpentine character, and ex-
tending apparently over two or three distant Counties.
Canterbury Pilgrims out for a holiday, walking up and down in a very
confined spare, and evidently either utter strangers to one another, or
they have all quarrelled and won't speak. This becoming a little flat,
they brina on the Frenchman and hustle him. Having thus intro-
duced a little life into the Scene, on we go again. Of course there is
no one to ride Flying-Scud-in-the-Box.
Snifflts (this ungenerous and subtle black-leg !). Hundred to one against
his starting.
Tilly. Done! (Brayvo, Tilly.)

Sniffles (this nngentlemauly jeering rascal). Who's to ride him P
The Horse Merino (pluckily). I will.
[Sniffles shuts up and tears his hat. Enter the Military. Major
O'Gaeden enters in a white silk hat turned up with green.
There being no attendants from Colney Batch present, he is
allowed to proceed to the Grand Stand. The horses are led in:
, the cads being probably outside.
The Bace.—Cardboard Steeplechasers somewhere in the next County
ajppear and move somehow. Then nearer. Then Cardboard Horses
jump the brook, one clever Cob doing it forwards and backwards
without once altering the tension of his stride. This feat alone would
secure the success of any Sporting Dramr.
The\Finish is perhaps a little tame, owing to the Real Horses being unable
to get beyond a walk from the side scenes, but somebody (name not
down in the card) wins, and then Miss Bishop appears on horseback
from a totally different ^course, and claims the victory. Place aux
dames!
Act in.
Exterior of Canterbury Railway Station.'? Everybody going by train and
bringing luggage, which is too large to be taken inside the Station.
Pantomime rallies. Rushes—doors slamming—Frenchman hustled.
Music gradually getting wilder and wilder, hurry, hurry (softly)
drum, drum creeping up quietly with a whack or two in prospect, just
to encourage the performance.
Now then, going to change the scene. Excitement in auditorium,
for we know that that atrocious villain Sniffles has taken a ticket by
the same train as Tilly Price is going by, and she's got a bag of
money with her for poor Captain Pudding custody in London.
Drum, fiddle, hurry, bang, bang, bang, gradually louder, getting the
steam up, like the Ethiopian seienaders used to do in their Bailway
Chorus.
[Oas down—avful moment—Tiddle-iddle-iddle—hurry—hurry. Fid-
dlers infls, playing without lights or music—bang, bang, bang.
Boy let loose on to two drums at once—whack—hurry, hurry.
Hooray! Here we are—here's the
EXPRESS NIGHT TRAIN,
Standing quite still, with its wheels turning madly, all managed,
we believe, through the mechanical artfulness of that unutterable
monster Snipfles.
[Bang, whack, crack, hurry, hurry—liddle-iddle-iddle on the drums
and fiddles, to make believe the train is really moving.
Sniffles and Tilly stepping out on the step of the carriage.

A JUVENILE OFFENDEB.
Mamma (log.) Our little Tommy is a very forward child for his age—
only six. He reads everything that comes in his way; this morning
he had got hold of the limes, and was reading the telegrams out loud,
when he came to one from Tien-Tsin in China, saying:—
"Viceroy Ma is dead."
"Viceroy Ma P" said Tommy, "isn't that a mistake P It ought to
be Viceroy Pr." Beally that boy's intelligence is above his years: you
wouldn't think it; we only hope it will please goodness for him to live:
but everybody almost says he's too clever; but it is a great comfort
to think that clever boys usually turn out stupid men.
On a Plagiarist.
"No genius he !_" cries critic Dick,
"A mere scribbling mechanism."
"To put it, say (we know his trick),
"That he's a Tegular Bepeater."
HANDYBOOK FOR CARD POST.
You are a domestic economist, anxious to save time, trouble, ex-
pense, and temper. You do not want to send a telegram whenever
there is a question to be put or an answer to be given; and you would
be glad not to have to look into your letter-case for paper, or your desk
for an envelope (perhaps, inadequately adhesive), and to be spared the
disclosure that you have not a single stamp left, that there is not one
to be found anywhere in the house, and that the last minute for posting
at the pillar-box is rapidly approaching. It may be, also, that you are
at times perplexed as to the proper formula to be used in addressing
an occasional correspondent—whether it should be ."Dear Sir" or
"My Dear Sir," " Yours truly" or "Yours faithfully," and for some
minutes after your letter has been despatched, are a prey to the dis-
tressing thought that you have been too familiar with Slattermore.
There is an end to all these trials and worries. It has come in the
welcome shace of a Post Card. But you raise an objection to these
"Letters Patent," as Punch has well termed them. You do not like the
notion of the messenger who takes your card to the post, the clerks,
sorters, stampers, and other officials through whose hands it must pass
in the Offices, the postman who drops it into your box, and the curious
domestic who takes it out of that convenient receptacle, knowing what
you have written. There is a ready mode of baffling the natural inqui-
sitiveness of all these classes of persons, who, it is notorious, have little
or nothing to do, sad must be delighted to while away the time in reading
notices of alterations in the family dinner hour, disappointments at the
circulating library, mortifications at the fishmonger's, and dismay at
the exorbitant price of feathered game. Adopt a cipher, the key to
which is only known to yourself and your correspondent—you can
easily arrange this beforehand; and then, under cover of some non-
sensical, commonplace, or mysterious sentence, you may, without fear
of detection, convey to the wife of your bosom, the object of your
affections, or the solicitor to your family, the inmost thought of your soul.
We subjoin a few specimen notes in cipher, which have received the
approval of the Postmaster-General:—',
1. From a newly-married man to his wife, from whom he has been
parted an hour and three-quarters, and whom he will see again in the
course of the afternoon:—" Dirty Esquimaux and roving Eastern
Sheiks taste pemmican every Thursday.'
2. From a young lady in the country to her cousin in London, an-
nouncing a most important event:—"Fanny's roses excel Dick's.
Hardy asters seem plentiful. Bead Oliver's pamphlet on seedlings—
excellently done. Will Edgar and Buth Ellen excuse no green-
gages, as grandmamma expects Dan P"
Key to the.cipher of 1 and 2—the first letter of each word forms the
message.
3. From a gentleman to the lady to whom he is engaged: their
last meeting was as far back as yesterday evening, and they will not
see each other again until seven o'clock to-night:—"Mem. Daily
papers show strange ignorance, but I shall go. Thin grog. ^Let no
parcels escape vigilance. Not cough lozenge, please."
Key—the last letter of each word.
4. From a lady at the seaside to the gentleman she is determined to
marry. Her friends disapprove of the match, and are afraid she will
elope:—" Clovelly seems lovely. Will Arthur think Clara's hat
exceedingly drollP Blackberries unusually tempting. Cousins of
Minnie's expected."
Key—the first three letters of the first word, the first two of the
second, the first and last of the third, and the first of each of the
remaining ones.
5. From a nervous and eccentric patient, who does not wish the
servants to know all her symptoms and remedies, to her doctor, who
happens to be at a distance:—" Opportunely, Cantabs climbed up
Hillsborough attitudinising capitally, others visibly compelling animals.
Owls chase bats at Esher. Cheap candles all allow: gin adherents do."
The doctor's answer (in the same style):—" Obstinate errors baffle one.
Oddly, dynasties fall. Onwards education! Away, languor! Attack
Devonshire cream."
Key—the second letter of each word.
6. From a jockey at Newmarket to a trainer in town:—" Bring
Saddel and we '11 change Tinker's kruper. Old Zach is ofended he un-
derstud about Al's lite van been engaged."
Key—the first letter of every other word.
7. From a client in difficulties to his money-lender :—" Nac uoy tel
em evah rehtona derdnuh P"
Key too abstruse for explanation.

Smiled down approvingly from overhead,
With mild benevolence and chastened pride.

he musical Bund has re-
ceived letters from London.
He is in a great state of agi-
tation. He is very sorry,
bat he must be off. They
(whoP) can't _ do without
him. (Boompje \)
It appears that he has re-
ceived an invitation from a
quartette party in town; and
he is to bring his own violon-
cello. Two violins, a piano,
and a violoncello. The dinner
is to come first, and after-
wards the four are going
to play Somebody's Some-
thing in G. Maullie says
he should like to hear the
tuning and screwing up.
Bund replies that the
screwing wdl be probably
done in the dining-room.
But this is only his way
of turning off the banter
good-humouredly, as if ever
man was in earnest and
bent on playing something,
no matter what, in G, Bund
is that man. He resolves
to get the music in Brussels,
and study it. Jomp having
had a day with the Landlord,
is expected for once to know
something about Brussels.
Bund asks him, "Do you know if there are any good music-shops P"
"O yes." Jomp, the intelligent, replies without the slightest hesita-
tion, as if he'd been born among them. "O yes "—then, as usual his
sprightliness vanishes, and he begins to appear almost sorry he'd spoken,
"Yes—um— um—dere are"—he admits it now as a probability—
"dere are music-shops."
His tone implies that though there are music-shops, yet. he should
say, they wouldn't sell you anything except ham sandwiches, or, in
fact, everything except music.
"They ought to be first-rate music-shops," observes Maullir, "in
this place."
Jomp rubs his head slowly, thinking this out, then shrugs his
shoulders, and puts his hands behind him, resembling in this attitude
himself (Jomp) in winter at a fireplace, or himself again (Jomp) in some
celebrated impersonation of the first Napoleon deliberating. So far
he does resemble the Great Emperor, he does deliberate. There the
likeness ends.
"Well!" exclaims Bund, impatiently, to whom, now, minutes are
crotchets, "Where are these music-shops P"
"Veil," answers Jomp, deprecating the commander's impetuosity,
"Veil—um—um—dese music-shops—um—um—dey are 'ere!'
"Go and ask somebody to tell you," says Bund, testily. Exit Jomp,
in tears. The Landlord enters, and gives Bund the required informa-
tion. Bund goes all over Brussels, and can only find Somebody in F.
They 're out of Anyone in G. So the Commander busies himself with
Bradshaw, to find out the shortest and most convenient route back to
his beloved Violoncello.
Maullie, R.A., has had his letters forwarded. Waterglass, the
eminent dealer, wishes to see him at once: an enormous commission.
We suppose it to be to paint the Norfolk giant in a series, with
perspective background, and giants of various ages in the gardens.
However, he must go, and as for Gooch, and Huntley, and Fdjton,
finding that if they stop at Brussels they will be alone in their glory,
and as, with the departure of Bund, the office of paymaster and com-
mander is in abeyance, it does not take them long to decide on a course
of action which will not precipitate the temporary separation of the
Club members, a painful necessity which we agree to leave until we
are once more upon the shores of Perfidious Albion.
"One Boompje bumper at parting" is Gooch's proposal, speaking
for himself, &c. Carried nem. eon. And the proposition being duly
developed, takes the form of a dinner, and the presentation of the
Boompje livery, which he has worn so long and with so much credit to
himself, to the immortal and amiable Jomp.
We are astonished at finding that Jomp is most anxious to get back
to London as quickly as possible. On being questioned he is some-
what reserved, but, as hitherto, so now, veracity itself.
"You want to get back quickly, eh P " asks Bund.
"Veil—um—um—yes—I should like to get back—um—yes,"—after
considering whether there is any other better form of expression, he
settles in his mind that there is not, and adds, " Yes—quiokly—O
yes."
"Why P" asks Maullie.
"Veil," Jomp returns, very slowly, and rubbing his'head, letting his
eyes wander all over us, the walls, the looking-glasses, and the carpet
pattern, as if the reason he was going to give us was written some-
where among these articles, like a revelation,—"veil—um—um,"—
fails to discover it in the carpet, and tries the right-hand window
pane over Bund's head,—" veil—um—um—I wish to go because,"—
another failure, he tries up the left wall as far as the cornice, where he
is stopped by some ornamentation, which drives him to the looking-
glass on the opposite side,—" because—veil—it is nothing,"—here he
smiles to himself rather bashfully, and we begin to think that he is
going to tell us of his fixed intention of getting married,—"veil—
only because,"—the furniture failing him entirely, he settles on Bund's
watch-chain, and brings himself to bay as it were,—" I vant to go—
um—um—because—/do not wish to stay here"
"Is there no other reason P " asks Gooch, iuquisitorially.
"Veil—um—um," Jomp admits there is.
"WhatisitP"
"Veil—um. I vill tell you "—Jomp begins in a tone'of most abject
apology, "I ave taken a—um—um—I ave taken a Otel."
"A what P " we all exclaim.
He is as frightened as if we'd all suddenly forbidden the banns of that
imaginary marriage we had fixed on him.
"A Otel," he resumes. "O yes, I ave him. Vy notP" Then,
warming with the subject, he continues, "Dere is mosh more money
to be made as that, dan as Courrier, O yes, mosh. It is in a good
place."
"Where P " we inquire.
"Vell." he pauses and looks round at us,'to see how we'11 receive
the intelligence; "Dm—um—um—it is in London."
He names London as if the idea of starting a Hotel in such a place was
entirely novel and original, and calculated to make an unheard-of for-
tune from its so taking the people by surprise. He had evidently looked
forward to people saying, "Hallo! here's a hotel! Why it's Jomp's
Hotel . Dear me, let's go in and sleep there, and dine there. and, in
fact, live there. All, every one; let us desert London and live in
Jomp's Hotel."
We cannot discourage him, as he has taken the
as taken the premises.
Make dee—two—tree—four—an
"A great place," lie explains,"
twenty or tirty Billiard Tables."
"How many beds P" was our natural question.
"O dere will be beds—O yes—plenty of beds. Enough for every
one to sleep most comfortable."^
Now what Jomp means by this is not to us distinctly clear: but it
does seem that up till now sleeping accommodation has been a con-
sideration of secondary importance by the side of Billiard Tables.
Unless those who couldn't get beds, were to be accommodated with
pillows and sheets on the billiard tables.
He goes on, evidently pleased, to give us particulars. "Veil den—
dere is varm and cold vater always turn on—O yes—den dere is a
exclaims Maullie, "what's the use of an
large Organ dat play several tunes
Good gracious!" exclf
Organ to a hotel P"
Vell." Jomp returns," he is no use, no. But I bought him at a sale.
He plays." he adds, with pride, to show that he's not been taken in,
"O yes, he plays."
"Any other curiosity in your hotel P" asks Gooch.
"Veil, no," answers Jomp, innocently. "But you must come dere
von day. I shall be delighted if all de gentlemans vill come."
"If it's conveniently situated," cried Bund, "we might have a
weekly Boompje dinner at your hotel. Jump."
He is radiant. He would be glad, he would give us a dinner—O
yes, we should dine.
Where is it P" asks Maullie, pleased, as we all are, at the ider.
"If it's in the neighbourhood of the Clubs, or about that part, it will
suit us down to the ground."
"Vell." Jomp considers, "veil—um—um—it is not near de parks—
no—veil it is—no," as if he were mentally calculating its exact distance
in inches from the Marble Arch or Wellington statue,—" veil—no—it is
not near de Clubs—no—but you can get dere—0 yes—you can get
dere."
This possibility is, we think, almost a necessity to the success of the
hotel. However, where is it r
"Veil, it is—um—um—it is in ^mtt^ficW!!"
"Is it!" exclaims Bund; "then, Jomp, you've made a martyr of
yourself; your friends will roast you, and, 'pon my life, you deserve
it. What on earth "but Bund is so annoyed with him that we are

obliged to come to Jomp's rescue, and start suppositions that he (Jomp)
had some good grounds for thinking he should get business in Smith-
field, in preference to any other place.
"O yes," replies Jomr, brightening up, as if anything like a tangible
reason for taking this Hotel in Smith held had never occurred to him
before, as perhaps it hadn't—"It is a good place for a Otel. Dere are
a number of ""farmers and Gentlemen Farmers from the Country
on business," suggests Gooch.
"No—um—um—No." Jojip rejects this source of wealth, and we
wonder on what vein, unknown to us, he is going to rely- "No— dere
are a number of Swiss Clockmakers living about dat part, and—urn—um
—/ tink dey vill come."
Jump's notion, fully developed, is that these Swiss Clockmakers,
firstly, "must eat; veil—dey come to my Otel." In vain we point out
to him that they '11 probably continue to dine, as they are doing now,
and have done for years, at home. He meets this objection by saying,
"Ah veil—but ven dere is a Otel. dey vill come." Secondly, that the
hot and cold water always on will be a great inducement to them;
thirdly, that, their work over, they will be delighted to recreate them-
selves with billiards. Again, we point out that, being chiefly, in all pro-
bability, family men, they will prefer to do as they have done for years,
the chances are, and stop at home.
"Ah," says Jump, "bat ven dere is a Otel and twenty, tirty, billiard
tables, dey vill come."
We advise him to get rid of his speculation to anyone who will buy
it, but he thinks we are wrong, and we hope he is right.
He says he must get back to manage it as, "it vill vant me to be
alvays dere," he tells us.
The above explanation of Jomp's views stood in lieu of a speech from
him at our dinner, where he waited on us, for not, let us hope, the last
time.
Bund from the chair made a neat and appropriate speech. He ex-
pressed his pleasure at having been, conjointly with the present company
(Mustley and Finton excepted, and welcomed as Junior Members)
the .founder of the Great Boompje Club, whose existence would be
synonymous henceforth with that of Science and Art. They would all
of them dine with him that day fortnight in town, ana book it.
"Messieurs," concluded our courteous ana hospitable Commander and
Paymaster (who has never yet sent in the bill, and never will) "Mes-
sieurs, au plaisir! Gentlemen, let us stand up and drink the Motto of
the Club, which emphatically and concisely expresses our sentiments
towards Number Two, and, at the same time, a long farewell to the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FEW NOTES ON SOCIAL SCIENCE.
niLoaoPHY at Liverpool was
a great success. People
have been hearing so much
about War that they are
glad to meet where bellicose
topics are excluded, just as
in the year of the first Great
Exhibition, the fact that at
a dinner nobody had men-
tioned the Show (yet that
was far better than its suc-
cessor the Shop) it was held
prima facie evidence that
the banquet had been a
pleasant one.
But the next meeting but
one will be the remarkable
Meeting. It is to be held
at Brighton. Yea, at the
place of which was writ far
back in the dark ages,
"And thou, Brigbthelmstone,
where no Cits annoy,
(All bound to Margate, by the
Margate Hoy)
"Where, should tome eager
Creditor advance,
Lies the light skiff, for ever-bailing France."
There if no Brighthelmstone, or town of him of the' Bright Helmet—
who was he, we wonder f—there is no Margate Hoy (though happily
there was one in the days of Sydney Smith and certain Methodists)
and there k no imprisonment for debt, so the ever ready bail of France
is net needed. But there is a Brighton, (whereat, wrote the aforesaid
S. S.—no connection of W. Huntingdon—" the deboshed London
bathers no longer hear the sound of French cannon") and the Cits go
there in shoals, and make night-trains hideous with stockjobbers' slang,
and where you will most likely meet your creditor, and hold affable
discourse with him on the Painted Ladies and other butterflies that
adorn the Parade. Yes, there is Brighton, once hallowed by the pre-
sence of King Turyeydrop, but in that good King's own palace, in the
very chamber made vocal by Captain Morris, now singeth the Music-
Hail star, bidding you paddle your own canoe, and act upon the square.
Thither are the philosophers to go next year but one, provided the
letters of lodgings will be reasonable, and not charge men of science,
who are not invariably men of money, much more for a week at
Brighton than they pay as a quarter's rent in London. Punch augurs
great things from this Brighton Congress. If its evening sittings could
be held on the very pretty West Pier, gay with variegated lamps, and
the excellent band would play between the speeches—or even during
them—profit and pleasure would be charmingly combined, and the
Marine Section could have its specimens fresh out of the water. We
do not see that this arrangement would materially interfere with the
for the promotion whereof the pier was so evidently and

"For Science never was designed
To make our Spooning leas."
Some of the Liverpool discussions have been exceedingly edifying,
But with the edifying portion Mr. Punch has nothing to do—he re-
veres the priests of science too ' much to make jest of their discourses,
even when they are prosy. He remembers George Herrert, of
Bemerton, on sermons.
"When all wants sense
Heaven takes a text, and preaches—Patience."
But there were many deliverances at Liverpool which only a Fool, with
a large F, would have desired to avoid or abbreviate. Peruse them,
Scholasticos, in the Athenecum, and be wiser. Then shall you have
earned the right to note these lighter things.
A paper was read on "Mothsemoglobin." This is the instinct, or
disease, which induces Moths to bum themselves in the Globes of
lamps. No very effectual way of preventing this was indicated, but
keeping them out of the room by shutting the windows might do
something.
A gentleman had unfortunately lost his paper of "Remarks on the
Heart of a Chinese Dog containing Htematozoa," but he gave a
pleasant Notice respecting the Embryonal Development of the Hsema-
tozoon Bilharsia, which was listened to with great delight and satisfac-
tion. There is a rule against encores, which might have been relaxed
in the present instance.
The British Conifera " were described. They may be seen at all
watering-places. These. Cone-Bearers wear a soft hat, tapering to the
top, and it was held by the meeting to be a great improvementTon the
Billicock, suns; about in King Lear—"Billicock sat on Billicock's
Hill," &c. It is not to the discredit of the many-sided Swan of Avon
that the hat he praised was not for all ages, but only for a time.
"Indications of a Pagan Race" were stated to exist in Scotland.
The meeting at once admitted that these were highly probable, and
several members testified to awful superstition in that country. One
speaker said that a Scotchwoman had refused to subscribe to the Sick
and Wounded Fund because of "that Popish symbol "—the Red Cross,
on the collector's book.
There was read an excellent paper on the " Relations to one another
of the Fins of Fishes." What the fins relate to one another was not
but a member thought it might help the 'discussion if he
that at dinner he never gave turbot fins to his relations, if
they were poor. It becoming clear that he had dined, he was assisted
to impart any further facts to the Nymphs of the Mersey.
In the Moon-Section it was mentioned that Plato is found to be
habitually covered with a great number of spots. This seemed easily
accounted for. He is very difficult to read, and when a student lays
down his pipe to turn to the lexicon, baccy will often escape. Bitter
beer, too, contains colouring matter.
The lamentable, or at least regrettable fact was stated that the
perihelia of certain'comets crowd very much about the solar apex. It
is so evidently the fault of the sun's motion in apace, that the Congress
decided on making a representation to that eminent body, in order
that the unseemly crowding may cease. He it to be respectfully re-
minded that he is not the Great Bear.
In the Biological Section a paper was read proving that " in certain
persons over-study has a tendency to produce insanity." It was
admitted, however, that the number of these persons was small,
infinitesimal, in fact compared to the number of those in whom under-
study had already developed something like idiotcy; but this discussion
was reserved for the Brighton meeting, when illustration will be
supplied by the fashionable young fellows plentiful in that locality.
In the Money Section a very remarkable proposal was made. A
gentleman "advocated the use of one-pound notes, to prevent the
wear and tear of coins." We live and learn. We never tore a sovereign,
but have often torn a one-pound note, when the dirty, flimsy, evil-
smelling rag was presented, as change, by a Scotch inn-keeper, N.B.
We always kept the pieces.
The same gentleman contended that a golden sovereign was only a
token. Sir John Luhhock. (we must name him) justly and indignantly
declared that it was more than a token. Before we can decide the con-
troversy, we desire more information, and any number of sovereigns
which Sir J. L. will cause to be forwarded to us from Lombard
Street, we will first accept as tokens of his esteem, and we will then
submit to crucial tests for the establishment of their complementary
value.
Having thus brought his remarks to the £ s. d. point, which is
the be-all and the end-all of all sublunary matters, Mr. Punch con-
cludes with his congratulations to the Philosophers of Liverpool,

HOPE FOR THE FUTUEE.
Mr. Punch,
A will-known quarter of Her Majesty's possessions, not a
hundred miles from the Bay of Dublin, will be in a blaze, a ferment, an
uproar, or whatever else you like to print as expressive of popular ex-
citement, when some news, which is now delighting the inhabitants of
an old-established and not altogether worn-out country, gets into papers
which are certainly not remiss in making the most of national slights
and grievances, real or imaginary, and into conversation which bears a
high character for brogue and blarney—news relating to a young and
Royal lady, who has a triad of charming names in " Louise Caroline
Alrerta, and a gentleman who was " educated at Eton and Trinity
College, Cambridge, has sat in the Liberal interest for Argyllshire, and
was formerly Captain in the London Scottish Rifle Volunteers," and is
now the luckiest young fellow in the Queen's dominions.
The Pkincess Louise is engaged to be married to—a Scotchman!

National Parliament in Dublin, and a renewal of the clamorous agita-
tion for a divorce from this tyrannical country P If not, then potatoes
have no eves, and buttermilk is not good for the complexion, and Irish
bacon will never again hiss in English frying-pans; unless — and
nothing but the value which I set on the suggestion I am now about
to make, would have induced me to leave a very comfortable easy chair

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
COMFORTABLE THEATRES.

Mr drar Puncit,
Now that Pari9 has become the theatre of war, we hear that
every other theatre in Paris has been shut. Paris without plays is as
wondrous to imagine as a workhouse without work: and it is difficult
to guess if the effects of this theatrical bereavement will in Paris or in
London be the more acutely felt. For how can our poor managers
get on without French pieces P And there will be no French pieces
to be brought out till the peace. If there be no open theatres there
can be no new French plays; and if there be no new French plays
there can be no translations of them, and what on earth are British
managers to do in this sad case f A modern French piece, well sup-
plied with the indelicacies of the season, has been played as a sure card
to win a virtuous British audience; and what sort of an audience can
be won without such cards P
Suppose, now, that a manager conceived the happy thought of
attending just a little to the comfort of the public, and thereby atoning
for the loss of French attractions on his stage. It seems a wild idea
to think of any comfort in a theatre: still the notion may be realised
with vastly little trouble, and might be found productive of consider-
able gain. Let men have room to stretch their legs, and not be forced
to stretch their necks if they want to see the stage. Let them sit no
longer cramped and crammed together, and let them not be worried by
boxkeepers and coatkeepers, all clamorous for fees. No longer let a
man who pays five shillings for a stall be charged a shilling more for
having it reserved for him, and another shilling still for being shown into
his seat. What would you say, 1 wonder, when purchasing a beefsteak
or a pair of gloves, if the shopman were to ask you for a shilling for
himself?
Moreover, let the audience have playbills given gratis, and let the
music of the band be a trifle more subdued, and not obtrusive upon
ears which have quite enough to do to listen to the play. Half our
orchestras appear now to consider it their duty to deafen half their
audience before the play begins: and, throughout the entr'actes, instead
of playing softly to tempt people to talk, they kick up such a row that
nobody can hear a word of what is said.
i- Workhouse reform has been pretty loudly called for, and playhouse
reform may likewise be thought needful. Little nuisances like those
v liicli I have gently hinted at may often prove great hindrances to
keep folks from the play. In spite of them, good authorship and
acting will doubtless prove attractive; but in competing with the pot-
house or its equivalent the music-hall, there must be increased atten-
tion to the comfort of the playhouse.
Wishing managers the wisdom to profit by my hints, believe me,
Yours in all serenity,
Saturday. Solomon Solon Smith.
THE ROYAL MARRIAGE.
Various Reports.—Tt was whispered in well-informed circles (long
before the truth was known) that the Princess Louise was to be
married to a Bishop. This, of course, is soon cleared up; it was the
mention of Lome that led to the mistake.
Again.—It was said that a great Croquet Match was on the tapis at
Balmoral, in which Princess Louise was to take a prominent party.
This arose from the fact of there being a Lome Party constantly at the
Highland Royal Residence.
Anecdote.—The Princess Louise is remarkable for her studious
habits and her neat wit. Knowing David Copperfield by heart, Her
Royal Highness lately asked Mr. P. . ck (who shall be nameless in these
columns), " VVhy the Marquis was likely to propose for her handP"
Mr. P. . ch, of course, gave it up.
"Because," said her Gracious Goodness, "he is like Mrs. Gum-
midge."
The Right Hon. Mr. P. . ch laughed, but being evidently expected
to pursue the subject further, submitted to H R.H. The Princess that
he (Mr. P.) did not.exactly see why the Marquis resembles Mrs.
Gummidgr.
"Because," answered the dear Princess, "he is Lone and Lorne."
Whereupon, hearing her Mamma call, she left the right hon. gentleman
to himself and.his note-book.
Notice to Correspondents.
Already the anticipated storm has begun. Mr. Punch has received
forty-nine letters enclosing witticisms, the "point" of which is that
his respected and beloved Princess is
"AUFor-Lorn."
He hereby gives notice that, as a loyal subject of the Reigning
House, and as an indignant member of the Republic of Literature, he
not only rejects all such rubbish, but designs a dire revenge on all
persons who shall presume to send such impertinence. Respect this.

DEMONSTRATION.
Georgia, U.S., is a State which has gone very far a head on the
path of progress in penal science, if its criminal law altogether is as
adequate to the correction of offenders as that part of it designed to
check the adulteration of food and drink. In a paper, treating of
legislation on that subject, read at the Social Science Congress by
Mr. Phillips Bevan, it was stated that:—
"In Georgia every brewer, distiller, grocer, merchant, or other person
selling pernicious or adulterated food and drink, and also all accessories after
the fact, are liable to a tine up to one thousand dollars, imprisonment up to
six months, whipping up to thirty-nine lashes, and to work in a chain gang
up to twelve months."
This interesting information appears to have escaped the notice of
the Land and Labour League. The adulteration of food and drink is
a crime by which the working-classes suffer especially. It is the
British Working-Man, and the British Working-Woman, with their
families, who, more than any other people, are cheated whilst they are
poisoned by the fraudulent grocer and publican. The example of a
principal State in the Model Republic should commend itself to
organisers and leaders of Republican demonstrations. Perhaps MM.
Oooer, Lucrapt, Bradlaugh, and the other Chiefs of the above-
named Association, will presently get up a Penal Reform Demonstra-
tion over the Water, meeting the Land and Labour Leaguers at the
Obelisk by the Surrey Theatre, and thence marching at the head of
them, with bands of music playing and banners flying, to Downing
Street there to visit Mr. Gladstone, and order him as soon as possible
to bring before Parliament a Bill for subjecting dishonest shopkeepers,
convicted of adulteration of provisions and liquors, to the chastisement
of whipping. Should the Premier object that the lash is a degrading
infliction, they may reply that, to nullify that objection, the pillory
might be revived and superadded to the cat-o'-nine tails, because the
punishment of the pillory, at any rate, is an elevating one. By making
a demonstration in demand of a measure particularly desirable for the
working-classes, M. Odgek and lus associates would be minding their
own business.

ONLY TWO LEGS TO STAND ON.
N the Home News for India

"An East-Indian is exhi-
biting a ' wonderful' horse
at Madras, which has only
the two hind legs. The
animal is said to be about
four years old."
This paragraph somehow
came to the notice of one
of the animals that have
jut distinguished them-
selves by losing the
Cesarewitch. The great
trouble the ambitions
creature occasioned by
its desire to show that it
could manage as well with
two legs as four, has been
happily depicted by our
artist. Nothing could
be happier, in faet, except
the face of the jockey.
NEW MUSIC.
We hear of some de-
lightful novelties in
music, which a very little
puffing will doubtless
render popular. First,
we notice a new ballad
called " The Timepiece by
the Thames," which clearly
owes its origin to "The
Watch by the Rhwe," *
song that now is being
"sung by fifty million
Germans." Further pen-
dants to this melody are
likewise said to be in active preparation; and this, considering its
popularity perhaps is not surprising-. One of these, adapted for the
French, we hear will be entitled "L'Horloge par la Seine," in which
the striking of a clock will produce what the advertisements will pro-
bably describe as "an effect truly striking." The other, written for a
Music Hall, is intended to delight the connoisseurs who revel in the
slang which there is prevalent. Composed as a companion to the
songs above described, and intended to be sung after the famous
"Reman Fall," it will be welcomed by the title of " The Ticker by the
Tiber."
A NICE CARGO!
The Times says:—
"Our Malta correspondent, writing from Valetta, informs us that 'news
has been received here of the expected arrival of a batch of two hun-
dred Jesuits from Rome. who together with one hundred and fifty already
here, will make a rather formidable collection of these politico-clerical
gentlemen!'"
What a charming place Malta will be to live in! The peace and
happiness of the families living in that fortunate island, its political
tranquillity, and the comfort of the resident clergy must now be perma-
nently ensured by this welcome addition to its society. Yet some
people seem never to know when they are well off, and to grumble even
at the good things provided for them, for we read on, "This invasion
is looked on with little favour by the Maltese clergy." We wish the
Times' Correspondent had added a word or two more, and told us how
it was regarded by the Maltese laity.
Music and the Drama.
It may have been remarked by some of our* elder readers that the
London Street Music-Bands are neither so numerous nor so good-as
they were a few years ago. That is probably because the musicians
who used to play in the streets must now be engaged at the daily mul-
tiplying theatres.
A Correspokdert inquires whether the Germans will care so much
for the Watch on the Rhine now that they have got the great Stras-
burg Clock.
EXTKACTS FROM MY COMMON-PLACE BOOK.
(N.B. The Authorities will be kept till called for.)
The circulation of the new and handy Post Cards leads the mind to
many serious reflections on postal communication, as carried on at
different times and in various countries in the World's history. The
following particulars relating to this deeply interesting subject have
been collected at great expense and not without some personal risk,
from rare books and unheard-of codices and manuscripts existing in
our public libraries, principally in those attached to the Levantine
Monasteries. They would serve as an excellent foundation for contri-
butions to magazines and reviews, lectures at literary and scientific
institutions, and conversation at the dinner-table or in the railway
carriage: heads of families and preceptors of youth, country audiences
and parties of not less than four, two children being counted as one,
may rely on the authenticity of the statements here adduced, the police
having received strict orders not to interfere.
Earlier than the Siege of Troy we have no trustworthy information
as to the regulations for Book Post; nor do we know, for a certainty,
at what crisis in the nation's history the privilege of franking was first
allowed, but scattered notices in the works of our best historians and
writers on the Belles Lettres point to a date anterior to the one generally
assigned by instinct.
It has only within the last few weeks been settled that the Savings
Banks of the Nile were not in connection with the Chief Office; and
the plausible ttieories built on some curious remains of mediaeval brick-
work, discovered by the Dilettanti Society on the coast of Arabia
Petraea, have completely crumbled away beneath the searching gaze of
modern scientific investigation.
Some of our learned Societies would do well to offer a reward—a
medal, or a premium of books, or copies of their quarterly publications
— for the beat essay on the long disputed questions whether the rural
postmen in the Italian Republics wore uniform or not, and how fax
they were allowed to receive boxes at Christmas; and if the writers
branched out into a comprehensive survey of the exciting circum-
stances attending the early struggles of the impressed stamp for ex-
istence, the cause of truth would be materially benefited at little or no
expense to the persons principally implicated.
We know the names of the Athenian Archons, the Spartan Ephors,
the Roman Consuls, the Italian Gonfalonieri, the Dutch Doges, the
Venetian Stadtholders, the Tibetan Grand Llamas, the Egyptian
Soothsayers, the Norse Vikings, the Provosts of Eton, the Masters of
the Ceremonies at the Bath Pump Rooms, and the Lord Mayors of the
City of London; but history ami tradition are alike silent as to the
first occupants of the post of Postmaster-General, when it was created
on the revival of letters in the Great Western Empire.
Their Majesties' mails have been carried in sundry odd fashions since
the day when Lrander swam across the Hellespont with a valentine
in his mouth for Hero; since the evening when Marc Antony sent
a trusty retainer, with a sweet message scraped on tablets of wax, to
Cleopatra dressing for a dinner-party. They have been borne across
sandy deserts by sure-footed mules, they have been carried up steep
mountain passes on the humps of docile dromedaries; India's haughty
elephant and Wales's hardy pony have travelled with them many a
weary mile through jungle and morass, over common and village
green; full-breasted pigeons, and inflated balloons, have passed swiftly
through the buoyant air with important despatches; the dogs of
St. Bernard, have been met on a dark winter's evening with the
monastery post-bag tied round their faithful necks with a piece of blue
satin ribbon; and even the ferocious alligator has been trained to
convey the hurried scrawl of the poor Nubian to bis wife and family,
sitting under a palm-tree in distressed circumstances.
Not many years before the close of the last century, the Post'Office
at Margate was a bathing machine, at Leeds a cellar, at Ipswich a
disused gig-house; and the romantic caves on the Yorkshire coast,
when not required for smuggling purposes, served as the depository of
many generations of village correspondence, before pillar-boxes came
into general use.
Statistics, as a strict rule, should be abandoned to learned bodies,
blue books and hardworking buttermen, but it may interest a large
proportion of the respectable inhabitants to learn that if all the letters
which pass through St. Martin's-le-Grai d, on any given day in the
year, could be placed in a row, end to end, they would reach from Wells
to Wigan and back again, within a few yards.
Similarly the newspapers would completely fill up the Suez Canal, if
it could be drained dry; and it should be strongly impressed on the
minds of the young and innocent that if the postage stamps, used by
Great Britain and her dependencies in the course of twelve months,
were heaped up together, they would form an enormous pile exactly
corresponding to the Great Pyramid in weight and dimensions.
(N.B. In consequence of the length to which these details, bearing
on one of the most important questions of the day, have extended, we
are compelled to postpone the communication of many other interesting
extracts.)

A Purlisher announces a new work, apparently serious, under a
remarkable title:—
"Ghanny's Chapters on Scriptural Surjects: Creation to the Death
of Moses."
Is the author of this volume a clergyman named Granny, then P
No, indeed; only the preface to it is the composition of a reverend
Divine: the Book itself is advertised as written " by Lady Mary
Ross." We are to understand, therefore, that Granny means Grand-
mother. It is something new for a biblical commentator to come out
avowedly in the character of an old woman. We hope Lady Mary
Ross will be found to have so acquitted herself therein, especially by
her manner of dealing, for example, with astronomy and geology in
relation to a portion of her subject-matter, as to delight Convocation,
astonish Colenso, and make philosophers see that they must not
pretend to instruct their Grandmother in a method of eating eggs.

have raised their wages in due proportion to the additional work
imposed on them by the new regulations for the postal accommodation
of the Public at large.

WAR NEWS.
(From your Own Cockalorum.)
I write to aay that this won't do, your noble Washup, which it
won't. That say young Bismarck has been sending to several papers,
German and English, to say that Your Chen's Account of the Meeting
between himself (meshing this Light-hearted Soldier) and the Hereditary
about that noble Oee (which subsequently astonished the mighty Baron,
as told in these Voracious Memoirs) was all a Simple Invention, and
never did take place at all!! It didn't; O no, never, of course not,
f'raps not, O no, which it weren't, and I'm another. O, of course.
'raps this truthful Militaire doesn't know the Hereditary Grand, O
no, of course not! P'raps he doesn't sup with him, and smoke pipes
with him, and lend him—but O no we never mention it—and joerhaps
this Lighthearted Gallant doesn't have no end of talky-talkies with all
the Hereditaries and Transparencies and Grand Books and six-foot
nothings in jack-boots all over the shop. O, of course not. O no!
Go it, Bismarck! Go it, my gay Politician!
And p'raps this Dashing Young White Cockader didn't buy a per-
forming Gee to ring bells, fire pistols, and put the whole art of war
into a nutshell. O no! And p raps this high-mettled Gee wasn't the
envy of all the Prooshian Officers from Hereditary Cockalorums, Dooks
of Seidlitz Powders, and Little Singymaringy downwards. Of course
not.
And what's the Real Truth. Your Light-hearted will give it you,
and no extra charge.
That wary round-the-corner Politician, that Artful Quirassier, that
Sagacious Prime Chancellor, was down on the noble Gee Himself!
This Gay Cockalorum was up to the whole bag of tricks, and was in
the stable: consequently Your Own knew the little game, and was up
to the little move. Of course the Chickaleary Chancellor couldn't bid
himself for the Gee, but he gets that brave Baron Motolke to do it
for him. Bless your buttons, I'm there. And this gay speculator asked
his price and got it: which it were.
Now, then, did I false report P Not me, George.
But you, Sir, You—O, how could you be down on Your Own Truth-
ful TommyP
And then write to this Light-hearted Soldier to know "what he
meant by itP"
Sir, your conduct has walked into me like a hot knife into butter.
On receiving your letter, which did not contain the due amount of stuff,
this Broken-hearted Warrior leant on his sword and wiped away a
trickier.
Mister, Sir, I appeal. This Gay Light-hearted Yours Ever Truly
appeals to the entire Prooshian Army, to the whole Civilised Biling of
Europe. against his enemies. As for Herr Bouncer Bismarck, he '11
have a line from this Unsullied Brave which will call him to the Tented
Field, and if this Scientific Warrior don't shake his door-mat, and
double up his Prooshian Perambulator, never trust the word of a British
Officer again.

Vlllum is at Versailles. Villum has just sent for this Light-
hearted Correspondent, to ask him about things in general.
Your Own attracts notice. All the people, as this Militaire walks
along the street, say "Goy! what a feller!
Villum and the Hereditary Grand met me in the Gardens. This
noble Marquis don't kootoo, and they know it.
"Villum," says Your Own, after the first now-was-you-to-morrows
were over, and the Staff was sent off, " how about that blooming.young
Bismarck P"
"Captain," says King Villum, "we 're all tiled here."
The Hereditary gave the sign, and we went hands round in the regu-
lar free-ami-accepted grasp.
What passed between us after this can't be told to a fourth party,
being, you '11 please to observe, strictly Masonic, and no admittance
except on business.
We separated late, this Silent Mason and the Hereditary putting
Villum the Victor into his virtuous downy. It was as much as we
could do to prevent him from telegraphing to Her Royal Majesty,
"All right. Cockalorums on the scoop. 'Not her battle," and then
he was for adding something pious from a hymn that he'd learnt in his
early childhood, which he sang in several different tunes, bringing it
out as a chorus to this Elevated Soldier's "Won't go home till
morning "—which we didn't.
• •••••••
Bismarck was not in the hunt, you perceive, but in consequence of
his conduct to this Gay Soldier, he has put himself in the cart.
Your Own is all over the shop, and tittup's the word.
B. has promised to send contradictions to all the German papers,
and this Gallant Soldier is himself again, and all there when the bell
rings as usual . Yours ever, Your Own, Dyngwell.
P.S. Post the Stuff, my Cockalorum. Think of the Cheque which
cheers but doesn't inebriate.—D.
NEW AND OLD LEADING.
The Bishop op Winchester has recently delivered an inaugural
address to the Church Congress at Southampton with his accustomed
eloquence. The Morning Post, in a leader, quotes and comments on
a specimen of the Lord Bishop s discourse :—
"When the awakening intellect first looks back upon the dull, lifeless,
irreceptive torpor in which it has hitherto lain entranced, the revulsion of a
natural indignation against the past is not without its perils," and "at such a
crisis, unless there be some guide capable of leading for a time the half-
recovered consciousness which discerns dimly the true relations between itself
and the objects around it, 'seeing men as trees walking,' it is but too pro-
bable that it will fall into some strxnge, and it may be fatal confusions. 'This
leading by the hand is the Church's true office,' and in order to its effective
discharge, Dr. Wilerrforce contends that she needs that readiness which is
bred of Conference."
Conference or confidence P Conference labours every year even as
the mountain did; but does she bring forth so much P You may,
indeed, call Conference Mother Conference, just as you would call
Goody Two-shoes Mother Two-shoes, Mrs. Two-shoes being past the
age of possible maternity. Who has ever seen the name of Conference
among the Births, and who conld have expected to hear Readiness
mentioned as a child which Conference had given birth to P
But never mind. "This leading by the hand is the Church's true
office." Hear, hear! Every earnest inquirer will be glad to know
that Bishop Wilerrforce says that. To be led by the hand—how
much more satisfactory it is than to be led by the nose!
THE BENEFITS OF A BOMBARDMENT.
Supposing London were bombarded, would the Tower, which is its
only fortress, soon capitulate P or would the Governor of that citadel
take a leaf, say, from the book of the Governor of Strasbnrg, and let
the city be destroyed before he would surrenderP How should we
relish hearing that the Strand was being shelled, or that Regent Street
was being reduced to utter ruins P Imagine one's dismay if the Bank
were laid in ashes, or if one heard of the complete annihilation of the
Punch office! In some respects, however, we could bow with resigna-
tion to the fate of a bombardment. We could bear, without complaint,
to hear that Temple Bar had been levelled with the dust; and, pro-
viding that the pictures had all been moved elsewhere, we should hardly
drop a tear on hearing of the demolition of the National Gallery. A
well-directed fire on certain back-slums we could mention, where thieves
do mostly congregate, would scarcely be regarded as a profitless ca-
lamity: and if all the barrel-organs in London were destroyed by the
bombs of the besiegers, the loss might by some few of us not wholly be
lamented. Supposing half our public statues should be blown to nits,
we trust the public sorrow would not be inconsolable: the one at Hyde
Park Corner would afford a mark conspicuous at a good long range,
and few lovers of the fine arts would regret its demolition. Were
Holywell Street set fire to by a shower of red-hot shot, we hope that
we should learn to bear the loss resignedly: and were a shell or two to
burst bang in the midst of Leicester Square, the desolation there occa-
sioned would hardly be more hideous than what we see at present.
TOTAL ABSTINENCE TRIED.
The Mussulmans strong drink eschew,
So likewise does your nuld Hindoo.
With wine, beer, spirits, they dispense,
And practice total abstinence.
Consider how that system works
Among the Brahmins and the Turks,
And, if we were the same to try,
Should we be much improved thereby P
Physic in the French Army.
A newspaper Correspondent at the Prussian head-quarters, refer-
ring to the French cavalry, says :—
'' At Sedan a magnificent charge was made by the Marquis Gallipot, at
the head of his chasseurs."
French pharmacy appears to be enabled to boast of a nobleman and
a hero.
Grammar of Assent.

PLEASURES OF MEMORY.
Getting well into the middle of telling a good story,
and then utterly forgetting just the very point of it.
Going more than twenty miles some fine morning to be
married, and remembering when at the church that you
have left the ring behind you.
Remembering an hour too late the appointment that you
made to meet your rich and highly promising old uncle,
who hates to be kept waiting even for five minutes.
Forgetting quite the name of Mr, Oiley, your new
rector, and addressing him in company by the name of
Mr. Bawler, whom you afterwards remember as a dissent-
ing preacher.
Returning from a "call" party about three o'clock,
a.m., and suddenly remembering that you have left your
latch-key behind you on the dressing-table.
Remembering that you forgot to take that bill up
yesterday, and recollecting how your credit suffered when
a similar accident occurred a year ago.
After wasting a fine appetite at home upon hashed mut-
ton, remembering that you have been invited to a banquet
at a hospitable house, where nine times out of ten you feast
on real turtle.
Getting through successfully the first verse of a song,
and then completely,forgetting the remainder.
Having just posted an urgent begging letter to a friend,
suddenly bethinking you that you have spelt his name
wrong, and feeling pretty sure that this is likely to offend
him.
Recollecting, on your way home after supping at your
club, that you promised to return and have an early dinner,
and escort your wife and your wife's mother to the play.
Remembering, too, the row they made the last time
you forgot t hem, and the rather costly visits to Regent
Street and Bond Street, which you had to pay by way of
expiation.
Going fifty miles from home for a day's snipe-shooting,
and when half way there remembering that you have left
your gun behind you, and have quite forgotten to pack up
any shooting boots.
Just as you are knocking at seven o'clock precisely at
your friend Jones's door in Kensington, recollecting that
you were to dine with your friend Smith, at Clapham.

We are abused right and left for not having interfered on one side
and on the other.
Suppose we had interfered, then, on the side of France, and suppose
we had interfered on the side of Prussir.
First suppose we had interfered on the side of France. What then P
The British Fleet would have helped the French Fleet in doing, so
much harm to Germany as the French Fleet has done. It would nave
helped the French Fleet to do nothing.
The British Army might have gone to the Rhine, where it would
have shared the fate of the French.
Our newspapers would at this moment be all moralising on our for-
getfulness of the couplet telling what happens to
"Those who in quarrels interpose."
Our principal families would all be in mourning; to the emolument
of the advertising Messrs. Magpie, and other drapers.
We should be in for Heaven knows what multiple of the Income-Tax;
perhaps for a fractional increase of the tea and sugar-duties.
We should have made an eternal enemy of Germany.
We should have deserved the gratitude of France.
France and Germany would have made peace over our heads, and
then what mutual arrangements they chose, not minding us, if not
combined against us.
Now suppose we had interfered on the side of Prussir.
We might, to be sure,'have stopped the war; and the French nation
would now be crying "To London!" But, if the war had gone on:
Our Military Contingent would have been a'drop in a sanguinary
ocean.
Our Navy would have fought the French. * We should have sent
some of their iron-clads to the bottom, and they would have sent some
of ours, to no purpose whatever as regards influence on the War.
We should be in for both a heavier income-Tax even, and a heavier
Butcher's Bill than we should have incurred by interfering for France.
France, having recovered from defeat, afraid to assail Germany
again, would immediately try to regain her lost "prestige" at our
expense. She would have Waterloo to avenge, and Paris besides. .She
would invade us, or try to, instantly; and serve us right.
In the meanwhile our Prussian friends would laugh at us, and leave
us, as they did in the Crimean War, to fight our own battles.
If we had interfered on either side, we should be much worse off than
we are.

FREEMEN CALLING FOR FIREARMS.
Council of that influ-
ential association, the
Land and Labour
League, has issued
an important address
to the Peoples of
Germany, France,
Spain and Italy,
which will probably
be read by some of
those whom it con-
cerns with the respect
and attention due to
the common sense of
its substance, and the
unadorned eloquence
of its style. It con-
cludes with the fol-
lowing quiet appeal
to its authors' fellow
countrymen:—
"Brothers at home!
be earnest, careful,
watchful! Call for the
arms of freemen, and
use them when freedom
calls."
The arms of free-
men at present con-
sist in part only of
the weapons which
they ought to be
armed with. As yet
no breach - loaders
have been issued to
the Volunteers. Their
call for the arms of
freemen, namely, the
most effective arms that are to be had, remains unanswered. The rest
of the Land and Labour League's "Brothers at home," are still less
likely to have any such call attended to. Said Brothers may call for
sword and rifle, which, however, will probably not come at their com-
mand, unless they themselves order and pay for them, paying also
10*. a-year each for gun-licence. Government will probably hesitate to
comply with the call for arms which are to be used when freedom calls,
by any other persons than the Volunteers, Militiamen, and other forces
who will then be called out.

LAST FROM A PARISIAN.
Mr. Punch extracts the following from a Jersey paper. Be has
every sympathy with the advertiser, and hopes that she may obtain
much patronage, but he thinks that perhaps the terrors of the Siege
of Paris may for the moment have disturbed her habitual exactness
in composition. But why did not her reverend friend kindly look
to her advertisement P
APARISIAN PROTESTANT LADY, just escaped from the besieged
city, of long experience and great success as a teacher, is forming
FRENCH CLASSES for YOUNG LADIES of both sexes, and is also willing
to give private lessons at the residence of pupils. Mdmi:. B. is strongly
recommended by the Rev. , and may be seen at his house.
THE PROGRESS OF WARFARE.
The army in France seems to be going up. It is not improbable
that we may soon hear of "the nations' airy armies grappling in the
central blue—"at least we read in the Times of something which ap-
pears to be preliminary to the fulfilment of the poetical prediction just
quoted. The remarkable statement to which we refer is as follows:—
"Balloons are daily sent off from Paris, and are carried by the prevailing
easterly winds to the provinces which are unoccupied by the Germans. They
are followed by light cavalry as long as they continue in sight."
Light cavalry, of course: heavy dragoons might find a difficulty in
trolling through the air, their drill not being as yet adapted to such a
strange element.
The Best "Royal Marriage Act."—The Princess Louise's

LOGIC BY A LIQUOR-LEGISLATOR.
The Gentlemen of the Platform, whose dictatorial self-conceit and
loquacity seek vent in the eloquence of aggressive teetotalism, at last find
it necessary to try and prove that " the Permissive Bill," which would
enable a majority to prevent a minority from buying what they want to
drink, is " consistent with Civil Liberty." The United Kingdom
Alliance" has published a speech, delivered, some months ago at
Exeter Hall, by Da. Brewer, M.P., in support of that not quite self-
evident proposition. What an argument for a Brewer!
Whether or not the speech of Brewer was worthy of his name, it
had one undeniable merit; that of brevity. Da. Brewer put the
question at issue, quite clearly, in few words:—
"The United Kingdom Alliance, say our enemies, starts with this avowed
intention, to prevent their fellow men from getting what they want, or at any
rate, where they want it, and they say this is intolerable to liberty, without
which no action is either good or bad, lor the valued file of all men's virtues
consists in choice and discrimination. I believe I have never heard the oppo-
sition to this association put more concisely, more tersely, or more vigorously
than this, and, inasmuch as it is the objection which met me in the lobby of
'e most highly gifted of our
look at the p
•r.)"
the
an'
of Commons, and which came
s, I think it worth while that we
like a ' grammatical' spirit. (Hear,
All this is excellent sense, except the word " grammatical," which,
however, inverted commas apparently denote to be meant to mean
something. It is not, of course, a misprint for "pragmatical."
Dr. Brewer confutes the most highly gifted of the United Kingdom
Alliance's antagonists thus :—
"First of all let us take the subject and then the predicate. I would ask,
then, who and what is the United Kingdom Alliance? Is it composed of a
body of men who have conquered the country at the point of the sword, and
are dictating to the subjugated race conditions or laws which may probably be
good and virtuous, but which are nevertheless objectionable and offensive to
liberty? Now, the whole argument, and all argument cognate with it, must
fall to the ground unless this, or something like this, can be established."
Dr. Brewer takes "the subject" and "the predicate," and then
he takes something else. He takes a point for granted, After " sub-
ject" and "predicate" comes "peiitio principii" in the logic of
Dr. Brewer.
Civil liberty cannot be infringed upon by any body of men but a
conquering army.
That, or "something like" that, is Dr. Brewer's assumption.
The (Ecumenical Council will never beat it.
There can be no such thing as the tyranny of a majority. That is to
say, of a merely numerical majority regarded in something like a
grammatical spirit," with Dr. Brewer.
Therefore, the majority of Englishmen did not infringe' liberty when
they imposed political disabilities on Dissenters. A majority has as
much right to shut up 'a meeting-house as a public-house. Will the
Rev. Dawson Burns accept these consequencesP
Dr. Brewer leaves no room for doubt as to what he means by
liberty. Speaking of the physical force which he and his associates
want permission to command, he says:—
"As I say, the whole force is based on moral force, and all we ask is the
liberty of a citizen to act for himself, and that a large majority shall control
the minority, without which there is no rule or government whatever, (Chsers)
That principle is the essence of liberty."
Namely, "the liberty of a citizen to act for himself "—subject, in all
things, to the control of the msjority. Is there no intelligent child
near Dr. Brewer to tell him that it is one thing to recognise the
necessity that fhe majority should legislate, and another to hold that
its legislation must necessarily consist with freedom and right P The
Kino or Dahomey is withheld from abolishing human sacrifices by
the public opinion of his subjects. If a majority can do no wrong, as
Dr. Brewer in effect asserts, the Dahomeyan majority are right in
keeping up their "grand customs."
He who does not see that liberty consists in the ability to do what-
soever you please, provided it be not in itself injurious, ought to be
sent to Earlswood. So ought everyone who perceives not that buying
and selling beer, wine, and spirits are acts in themselves innocuous,
and become hurtful only when the freedom of doing them is abused.
If the " Speech of Dr. Brewer, M.P." delivered to prove "The
Permissive Bill Consistent with Civil Liberty," may be considered a
criterion of his reasoning powers, we can only say to our little boy :—
"Behold, my son, with what little wisdom Colchester is represented
in Parliament."
Very Much So.
A Student of Chinese metaphysics having moistened the dry subject
with several bottles of various liquors, told a friend that "He thought
—(hiccup)—the 'shubjeck—very—(hic)— very—Confushius." He was
considerately put to bed. (N.B. The Student was no relation to the
German De Wette.)

FIVE MINUTES WITH BISMARCK.
(From our Special Correspondent.)
I had a chat last night with Bismarck. We smoked a cigar
together. He talks quite unreservedly of the War; says he has no
secrets about it; why should he have any f It is everybody's business
as much as his own. .''i„...
I told him I thought he was a fool to stick out for Alsace and Lor-
raine. No, he said, he was not a fool; he knew well enough that Alsace
and Lorraine would be more plague than profit; bat the public opinion
of Germany demanded those provinces, and real public opinion, another
thing from the propension of the gentlemen of the pavement, could not
be disregarded even if .it were despised. The German public was the
fool; not he. .
Well, I said, now it's a pity; for see what a risk you run. Here
will be winter coming on presently, and in another fortnight you will
have to fight General November. It is quite on the cards that you
may be attacked with influenza, For even dysentery, not to mention
cholera and typhus, and forced to beat a retreat through hostile terri-
tory, in frost and snow, like the Great Napoleon; by Great I mean

peace with the French, at the best upon equal terms, and in that case,

Why then, don't you see, I explained, you will of course lose your
indemnity. Hadn't you better make peace while you are sure of that P
That never struck me before. said Bismarck. I tell you what, you
are a deuced clever fellow, ana your head is screwed on the right way.
Yes: we might make sure of the indemnity now: at all events could
collar the French Fleet. I'll go to the King directly, and tell his
Majesty what you suggest. A splendid idea, dear boy, he added,
slapping me on the back. Good bye. Don't say a word to anybody
of what we have been talking about. Good bye for the present; but
drop in again soon. I shouldn't wonder if your, hint has important
consequences. Before you go, give me another of those cigars.
A sensible fellow with nothing like pride about him, or stuck-up
notions, and quite capable 'of listening to and , appreciating. good
advice, is Bismarck. ' I shall not be at all surprised to hear in a day
or two that peace has been concluded on the basis of an indemnity/the
demolition of the forts, and, for the rest, continuance in statu quo.
Reunion Extraordinary.
A Police Report of the proceedings at Guildhall one day lately
commenced thus:—
"All the accused at this Court yesterday were named Smith."
To the Hostess, who calls Christopher Sly a rogue, that antiteetotal
tinker replies, " Y 'are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues." It too
plainly appears that the boast which may have been true respecting the

CONSIDERATE GERMANS.
Many an anxious bosom will be relieved of the gravest apprehension
by the following extract from a letter of a champagne manufacturer at
Ay :—
"We are buaily engaged in securing our crops of grapes, in which we are
not impeded by the Oerman troops passing through the town every day, but
receive every protection from the commanding officers. I feel it due to them
to acknowledge this; and the whole world will be grateful to them for their
forbearance and aid, when the soldiers of many other armies would, under
similar oircumstances, have been turned loose in our vineyards, not only to
eat up the fruit so temptingly displayed in their sight, but also to trample
down and destroy the plants themselves."
By far the greater part of Champagne so-called, may be made of
rhubarb, but still the thought that the grapes of the real Cham-
pagne district were in danger of being destroyed was very dis-
piriting. Yet any one might have been relieved of such a fear by the
consideration that the intelligent Germans have far too much good
taste to destroy the sources of good liquor. If they were induced to
invade England by the demonstrations of our " British Republicans,"
and their associates, and enabled to do so in the local absence of our
fleet, by our general want of military organisation, and had then to
besiege London, in case London were a fortified town, they would
doubtless avoid, if possible, the bombardment of Messrs. Barclay
& Perkins's Brewery; or did they, under the same conditions, beleaguer
Burton-on-Trent, they would not willingly shell the establishments of

ENCOURAGEMENT BY TERROR,
In a certain popular ballad a naval Captain addresses the following
statement to the heroine of the poem, concerning the hero:—
"If that your true love's Billy Taylor,
Ho's both cruel and severe."
The subjoined telegram waa sent, the other day, to Mr. Rioter
from Tours:—
"The Commander of the Army of the Loire has announced that he will
shoot any soldier guilty of hesitation before the enemy."
This terrible Turk, actually a Turco perhaps, of a French military
Commander, reminds us of Billy Taylor, He certainly deserves the
epithets applied to Billy Taylor by the Commander in the British
Navy according to the ballad above-quoted. The Commander of the
Army of the Loire is both cruel and severe. That is, if he is as bad as
his word, and does really mean to shoot any soldier who may prove
guilty of hesitation before the enemy. But it may be feared that he
will carry cruelty and severity yet farther than that, and be even worse
than his word. He will only too probably shoot, if he can catch, any
soldier who, before the enemy, shall be guilty of no hesitation in run-
ning away.

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
irected my steps to the
St. James's, to see Fer-
nanrle. Saw it. Written
strongly ia French by At.
Victories Sardou. Cer-
tain very strong French
points necessarily omitted
in the process called "re-
vising." Bnt Fernande is
(rood; better since the first
night, on account, of having
been re-revised and con-
siderably curtailed.
It is capitally acted by
all concerned, and it is
some time since I have
seen either Mrs. Hermann
Vezin or Mr. W. Farren
so well suited. 1 con-
gratulate Mrs. Wood on a valuable acquisition in Miss Fanny
Brough (Fernande), and I thiuk I shall be able, when Mr. Lin
Katne has "revised" some defects of pronunciation and certain
indications of an affected mannerism, to congratulate the manageress
on one of the best " first young men in London.
Now to my usual before-and-behind-the-Curtain account of
FEHNANDB.
ACT I.
Fidgety Gentleman (in Stalls, looking at his watch, and speaking to his
Friend). 1 say, 1 hope they '11 begin punctually : we've got to catch the
last train.
Hit Friend (from country, who, being ouly up for a few days, wants to
hace his full two penn'orth). O yes, it 'II be all right.
Play begins.
Well-Informed Person (to some one not so well-informed). This was a
great, hit lu Paris. Capitally acted t here.
Bis Friend (coming to the point). Did you see it P
Well-informed Person (brought to book). No— (saves his reputation)—
hut 1 know all about it. (Wishes he had seen it in Paris, so as to have
been able to tali about it now authoritatively.)
Scene—An elegant Saloon.
Enter M. Bricassin (Mr. Gaston Murray), looking awfully villanous,
with a most remarkable evening-dress waistcoat.
Intelligent Person (in Stalls). He'd be the ruin of any gambling-
house. No one would play for sixpence with a man in such a waistcoat
as that.
Enter another Villain of the hairdresser's-shopwindow-figure order. A
mild-looking swindler, with evident false whiskers.
Enter M. Roqueville, keeper of gambling-house, with a pair of the
fiercest moustachios.
Enter M. Pomeeol (Mr. Farren). Altercation between these parties,
not particularly intelligible.
Enter Marquis des Arcis (Mr. Lin Rayne), a nice young man.
Respectable Pomerol (astonished: to Nice Young Man). Why are you
here P You mustn't be here!
Nice Young Andri. Why not P
Respectable Pomerol. I 'II tell you. [Tells him a long story.
Nice Young Man (convinced). Thank you. I '11 go. (Goes, probably
in order to avoid hearing another long story.)
N.B. M. Victokien Sardou is addicted to long stories.
Enter Clotilde, surname unknown; position in society, uncertain;
widow or spinster, unexplained; older or younger than the yoUng
Andre, to whom she is engaged, nobody knows.
Pomerol (the respectable—astonishedfor the second lime). Ha! Clo-
tilde! Why are you here P
Clolilde. Don't you know P I '1I tell you.
[Tells him a story about having run over Fernande in the street,
and brought her back in her carriage.
Pomerol. But you mustn't be here!
Clotilde. Why not P
Pomerol. Don't you know why not P I '11 tell you. Listen. Twenty
years ago, &c., &c.
[Pays her out by telling her a long story, and then she knows why she
shouldn't be here.
Roqueville (to Pomerol). You shouldn't be here.
Pomerol. Why not P
Roqueville (brutally). I '11 soon show you why not. [He doesn't.
Enter Fernande, to thank Clotilde.
Pomerol (to her). You shouldn't be here.
Clotilde (shutting him up). I know that as well as you. But here
I am.
[Commander Jarri then plays at some game with the Villain in a
waistcoat, who, knowing that he hasn't got a cltance of appearing
again in the piece, becomes very noisy and excited. False alarm
of Police given by Fernande.
Roqueville (naturally angry). Why did you do thatP
Fernanda (the practical joker). 1 only rang for Madarm's coachman.
Roqueville. Did you P Then
[Row. Pomerol knocks him down. Jarri presents a pistol at him.
Villains (their last chance) throw themselves into attitudes. Curtain.
Bravo!
Intelligent Person (in Stalls). I wonder how the deuce they '11 manage
to get out of that house.
His Friend. Don't know.
Fidgety Gentleman. I say, they 're an awful time between each Act.
Must catch last train. Do hope they won't tell any more long stories.
ACT II.
Clotilde's House or Georgette's House, uncertain.
Georgette. So you are happy (to Clotilde). I 'II tell you why you
should be jealous, as I am. [Tells her a story, and makes her jealous.
Enter Andke, Clotilde's intended.
Clotilde (just to try him). I don't love you.
Andre. Hooray! I'm another. Now I'11 tell yon all.
[Tells Iter a long story.
Clolilde. Let ire introduce you to the young person whom you do
love.
Andri. Who is she P
Clotilde. I '11 tell you. [Not having a long story ready, she invents one,
and tells him. Then they all go to dinner.
Fidgety Person. Hang it! these stories take up no end of a time.
The train goes at 1130.
ACT III.
Return of Pomerol and Jarri to see Clotilde on Andre's wedding-day.
Pomerol. And so
Clotilde (aside). He knows nothing. (Aloud) I will tell you.
[Invents another stony, and tells him.
Pomerol. We must go to the wedding.
Clotilde. O no, not until we've had two or three more stories.
Commander Jarri will oblige.
[Jarri obliges with two or three anecdotes (/foreign travel, and fails
to make his point out of a little Corsican joke.
Clotilde. Very good. Now, Pomerol, I Ml tell you a story.
[Tells him how she's taken in and done for the nice young man A ndre.
Pomerol. O you . . . .! Shut up! [He shuts her up, so that she
can't tell any more stories, and turns the key on her. End of Act.
Fidgety Person. Hang it! it might all be told in one Act, and here
—dear me! the train goes in half an hour.
Bis Friend (hopefully). O,1 dare say the last Act will be very short.
ACT IV.
Andr£ and Fernande married.
Enter Clotilde by a back door.
Clolilde (aside). He knows nothing.
Andri. Clotilde! Why are you here P
Clotilde. 1 have come to tell you all.
[Tells him all for the last lime, and goes away.
As "all" is not very terrible in the English version, Andre, on hearing
Pomerol tell him a few more stories and read a letter, forgives him.
Fernande and they are supposed to live happily ever after.
Fidgety Gentleman (after Clotilde's exit). Hang it I we must go.
Bis Friend (from country). But, I say, do let us see how it finishes.
Fidgety Gentleman. Can't. Train goes in quarter of an hour—(makes
a discovery)—besides
Reads the bill, the whole plot is written down.
Exeunt both. The play finishes.
Gladness in the Ghetto.
The Official Gazelle of Rome announces that "the Israelite married
couple, Cohen," have recovered from a convent their little boy,
kidnapped by the priests in 1861. Accounts from Rome further repre-
sent the Jewish community at large as rejoicing greatly in the annex-
ation of Rome to Italy. The anniversary of the plebiscitum which
effected that event will doubtless be observed by the Jews as a regular
jubilee, when, indeed, the Ghetto will resound with the chant of
Jubilate intoned in the original tongue.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

LIGHT READING.
hough a young City mer-
chant, Mr. Punch, whose
interests are closely bound
up with indigo, 1 am fortu-
nate enough to have a good
literary appetite, which I
satisfy in a morning before
I go to business (as a
bachelor I can do as I please
at the break fast-table), and
in an evening when I return
to solitude and a preparation
of the tobacco plant.
I subscribe lavishly to a
library of considerable re-
pute, and am as catholic in
my selection of books as I
am iu my admiration of
female beauty. I will not
say that heavy reading has
a monopoly of me, but I
certainly could not subsist
on such a sickly, unwhole-
some diet as that with which
habitual novel-readers de-
stroy their digestion.
I gain a good share of in-
formation and amusement
from periodical literature,
and since the age of sixteen
have been a steady peruser
of the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews. So much so, that I feel it
to be a grievous thing, after so many years' pleasant acquaintance with
those respectable veterans, both now between sixty and seventy,
to be compelled to lodge a complaint against their treatment of
that large party of readers who, like myself, turn to their pages rather
as a relaxation than as a study, and would be glad to have a light entrie
or two along with the solids and substantial. I have before been dis-
mayed by my glance at the contents of these two old friends, but
never, I think, with so much depression of spirits as during the current
quarter.
A few evenings ago I came home, perhaps more than ordinarily
weary of indigo and its ramifications, and found on my table the new
Edinburgh, dressed like an old country gentleman, in its usual blue coat
and buff waistcoat. I looked with some eagerness at the list of articles
endorsed thereon. What did I find written for my recreation P First,
in the van, where a Pope is not often found, "Sixtus V." About this
contribution I have only one thing to say—that it might have been
worse; for it might have been on Pros the Ninth, and the mere
sight of thirty or forty pages of (Ecumenical Council, and Papal Infalli-
bility, and Temporal Power, and Archrishop Manning, and Cardinal
Antonelli, and Eastern Patriarchs, and services in St. Peter's, and
Ultramontanism, after ten months' hard newspaper reading on these
choice topics, would have been beyond endurance.
My interest in Sixtus the Fifth (as regards the length of his reign,
he was, I believe, one of the short Sixes) bein$ but slender, I passed on
to "Aryan Mythology," which, I think you will admit, was not exactly
the subject one would care to study for the first time rather late
in the evening, when fatigued by a more than ordinary attention to
mercantile pursuits. A pleasant occupation, I have no doubt, on a warm
summer's afternoon, in a shady garden or retired orchard, to dally with
the Aryans and their mythology, to which time I adjourned my inves-
tigation of the subject and went on to the next article—" Memoirs of
a Russian Dekabrist. I cannot clearly recall what happened, but I
believe I was found on the hearth-rug unconscious by a terrified atten-
dant. As it was growing late I hesitated about sending a telegram to
the Russian Embassy begging for an explanation, and I was personally
unacquainted with Mr. Hepworth Dixon, so dismissing the ser-
vant with an assurance that I should soon be better, I resumed my
reading—"Dr. Newman's Grammar of Assent." 1 was too much
shaken by my encounter with that terrible Russian Dekabrist to close
with so tough an antagonist as the Doctor: indeed I was only just able
to face " Ernst Moritz Arndt," and felt wholly unequal to moving in
"Prehistoric Times;" but even that period in no-history seemed to
me preferable to "The Campaign of August, 1870"—for I was as weary
of the War as of the Pope—ana the " Reign of Annr" appeared by com-
parison a gay and festive scene. Finally, I laid down the Review with
an inflexible resolve to send it back to the library as soon as it was
daylight, when I discovered that the concluding article, the only one
left for me to trust to for the rest of my evening's amusement, dealt
with such a nice light subject as "Germany, France. and England."
The next night the quaker-like Quarterly succeeded the Edinburgh;
but as I am unwilling to encroach too daringly on your space and good-
nature, I will merely say that out of its nine articles only six treated of
the War, Napoleon III. and Prevost-Paradol, and our own Army
and Navy; that another discoursed of " German Patriotic Songs "—
and you know we have heard pretty frequently, of late, of " The Watch
on the Rhine," and " What it the German Fatherland?"—that another
had the irresistibly taking title of " Von Syrel's History of the Revo-
lutionary Epoch," over which I have reason for believing that L fell
forward with my head in dangerous proximity to the candles; and that
it was entirely "Sir Henry Bulwkr's Life of Lord Palmerston"
which saved me from an undue recourse to stimulants, or, as the sorry
alternative, a premature retirement to my bed, to dream of a fearful
attack of the Aryans on the Dekahrists, gallantly led by Dr. Newman
and Sir John Luerock; of Sir Henry Bulwer assisting Earl Stan-
hope to bur n Von Sybel's books in the Vatican, and of the whole
of the party singing German patriotic songs till morning, and compel-
ling Sixths the Fifth and Napoleon the Third to put on their
dressing-gowns and join in the chorus. Mark Anthony Lane.
HINT TO A SPECULATOB.
We live in an age of such hurry and scurry that reading the news-
paper, with the attention due to the efforts of the educated and con-
scientious journalist, is now impossible for our fast folk. It occurs to
Punch that a speculator might make money by printing this sort of
thing every morning—the text which the leading articles of the
journals enforce, and sending it in to us as a fly-leaf with one's papers.
Here are the heads of one morning last week:—
Timet.
French keep on humbugging themselves. Gariraldi no good.
We are all delighted with Princess Louise's engagement.
Mr. Cardwell looks at our Army through rose-colour.
Alhambra and Highbury Barn ought to be smashed.
Daily News.
We really must not interfere with the belligerents.
Relief Fund for French Peasants begins its good work.
Suppose the Emperor should complete bis skeleton Novel.
Fall of Soissons. Mazzini is let loose. Vile street Bands.
Telegraph.
French Peasantry are very virtuous. What will they do P
French Elections ought to have taken place.
Alhambra and Highbury Barn ought to be smashed.
Rain in London on Sunday is very detestable to foreigners.
Women should attend to the Education Elections. Hospital dis-
sections necessary, but should be performed considerately.
Rochester Castle to be preserved.
Standard.
French are baffling and beating the Germans.
How is Germany to be re-constructed P
Germans are really too hard on the French.
Irish aid to France meant to insult England, but good in itself.
Duke op Devonshire endows a Physical Chair at Oxford.
Morning Post.
The Germans abate no jot of their demands.
Lord Mayor Besley is working for the Volunteers.
Importance of Lord Derey's Education Meeting at Preston.
Advantages to Rome from Italian occupation.
"ARE WE SO GREATP'
Germany, with 700,000 soldiers and a quarter of a hundred of victo-
ries to count, locks up one poor Dr. Jacory for daring to object to an
annexation of territory. Either the Doctor must be an extraordinarily
and stupendously great man or somebody else is a much smaller
man than is supposed. Why, England has a miniature army, and no
recent victories to talk of, and yet she has not locked up one man out
of ever so many hundreds who met the other day and declared them-
selves " The British Republicans." She only laughed, and hoped that
when they had done spouting they would go back to their work, and
take their wages to their wives, and not to the public-house.
Inhospitability.
Of the act of the Middlesex Magistrates, in checking impropriety at
Al-Hambra (the Al-Hambra, as folks say who talk of the Al-Koran), we
entirely approve, notwithstanding the loss which many " Ministers of
Religion will—at least according to counsel—sustain. But it must
be owned that the time (when the whole neighbourhood is crowded by
the influx of foreigners) is an odd one to introduce English morality
into Lesterr Squarr. Is it a missionary movement P

WITH A LOVING-CUP TO LOUISE.
Why pause from war-thought and war-talk for this small matter's
taker
What's the plighting of a Princess such a buzz and stir to make f
What's the plighting of a Princess, though she be young and fair,
And gracious in the people's eyes, for her blue eyes and brown hair P
Nay, though of many sisters whom loyal England lores,
This be the one that, somehow, her special fondness moves:
Though in the hour when Royal wont Princess to Prince decrees,
There's none the heart of England had so gone with as Louise.
Yet seems it strange, at such a time, when two great nations stand
In mortal strife, fierce face to face and bloody hand to hand,
That England should have thought or ear for the news of yester morn—
Princess Louise is plighted to the young Lord of Lorn.
A princess wed a subject—and Queen-mother not forbid!
The daughter blessed not barred—her choice welcomed instead
of chid!
The barrier of the Marriage-Act, that curb of Royal hearts,
Drawn to let through these lovers, as though no Crown disparts!
Is't that Queens have grown wiser, or Princesses more fond P
Or crop of Princelings smaller across the herring-pond P
Is't that promise or that produce of crownlets waxes poor
In these days, that Deutsche Einheit shows small sovereigns to the
door P
Or is't the slow, sure wave of thoughts and tendings of the time,
That hath crept up, and ever up, e'en to those heights sublime,
Where crowned heads in ethereal air once seemed of other mould
Than ours, that in the work-day world their painful breathing hold P
Or is it Love the Leveller that has gone blithely forth
To urge on his bold quest this fair young Berserk of the North:
Bidding him plant the crown of Love atop of England's crown.
And to both Queen and Princess saying, Yield ye, and come down"P
But be it Queenly policy or be it Mother's love,
That sets a daughter's happiness old use and wont above;
Or be it tendence of the Time, or be it Cupid's grace,
That crowns the loving woman's heart, and lights the sweet young
face—
England is happy, thinking how happy she must be,
Where she has given her heart to give her hand, though Princess, free;
Hearing the young Lord of her choice is manly, grave, and bold,
Worthy the ancient name and place of Mac Callum-mokr to hold.
Glad that the flower of Windsor's flowers is left to blossom here,
Among the hearts that hold, and have best cause to hold, her dear,
Glad one fair daughter's daughters should grow up round the Queen,
As maidens, wives, and mothers, to be what she has been.
And Punch, who says for England what England's heart would say,
Bids God bless this dear young Princess and her Lord on wedlock's
way,
And grant that they may live and thrive and rear their babes to prove
No crown so worth the wearing as their crown of wedded love.
Too Great Luxury.

FRANCE DISILLUSIONED.
tjre, and that's one of
them," as the ship struck,
added the Irish pilot to his
assurance, in answer to the
Captain, that he knew
"every rock in the Chan-
nel." "And that's one of
them." The anecdote is re-
lated somewhere by Jo-
SEPHUS (MOLAJUUS).
M. Jules Favrr, in bis
lately published reply to
Bismarck's circular re-
specting their interview at
I errieres, announces that,
"France has no illusions left."
His outcry of passionate
exaggeration concludes,
however, with the sub-
joined prophecy, whence it
appears that,, in truth,
France does still cherish a
•'—.,,4 few—just a few—illusions:
"France, even if ultimately
vanquished, will remain eo
great in her misfortunes, that she will become the object of admiration and
sympathy to the whole world."
"And that's one of them." The idea that France, vanquished in a
war of her own seeking, will become the object of admiration and
sympathy to the whole world, or to any portion of it except the insane,
is one of those few illusions.
Nevertheless, let us not despair of France. She has one man of
sense as well as courage: qualities both conspicuous in General
Trochu's letter to the Mayor of Paris. The former of them shines
like the electric light in the following paragraph:—
"I conclude, M. le Maire, this statement with a few reflections. In the
month of July last the French army, in all the splendour of its strength,
passed through Paris, amidst shouts of 'A Berlin!' 'A Berlin!' I /as far
from sharing their confidence, and alone, perhaps, among all the general
officers, I ventured to tell the Marshal Minuter of War that I perceived in
this noisy manner of entering upon a campaign, as well as in the means
brought into requisition, the elements of a great disaster. The will which,
at this period, I placed in the hands of M. Ducloux, a notary of Paris, will
one day testify to the painful and too well-grounded presentiments with which
my soul was filled?"
O, the prophetic soul of General Trochu! He never was one of
the prophets that prophesied falsely because his people would have it
so. He does not, prophesy or dream that France, contemplated in the
misfortunes which she has drawn upon herself by the present war,
will remain so great that she will command the whole world's admira-
tion and sympathy. He has no illusions, as Jules Favre has. "And
that's one of them."
It will, nevertheless, be quite possible for France to obtain universal
sympathy and (Ecumenical admiration by renouncing the pomps and
vanities of military glory, to which Frenchmen have been led by the
War Demon to devote themselves, by his own rite, the initiation
which Mars, altas Moloch, has taught, them to call "the baptism of
fire." Otherwise France, overwhelmed with misfortunes and miseries
incurred by the attempt to inflict them upon others, will merely serve
to "point a moral and adorn a tale." The tale will be that of her
invasion of Germany, and the moral will lie in the observation, that
they who took the Chassepdt have perished by the Needle-gun.
PAE BALLON MONTE.
Rejoice, ill-used Montgoltier,
De Rosier be proud,
From ghosts of your old aerostats,
Look down upon the crowd!
The globe you first constructed
To soar into the skies,
That the world scorn'd as useless—
A toy, in all but size—
That wronged child of your genius
At last has proved its claim
To all that you asked for it—
Nay, serves ends past your aim 1
Seemed, for no higher purpose
Your globe was skyward borne,
Than a draw at Vauxhall Gardens,
An attraction at Cremorne;
And if as stout Europa
On her bull, in fleshings bare,
Unblushing Madame Poitevin
Displayed her charms in air, -
Or if Gheen, upon a pony,
Stooped to dangle from Lis car,
Or a Clown rose on a donkey,
Twas ballooning above-par:
And lessee-ship enterprising,
If an acrobat was found,
To venture lofty tumbling
A half-mile off the ground,
In trapeze twists and twirlings
Above our sight to soar,
While pendant fireworks round him
Spread smoke, and spark, and roar.
But now, if we would measure
The infinite of space.
Or sift the fluffy cloudlets
That speckle heaven's bright face;
Take soundings of the atmosphere,
Or anal) ze sky-blue,
1 ii a trice the Gallant Glaisher,
Calls Cox well, taut and true,
And with hydrogen for horses,
\nd a balloon for fly.
Takes a drive a la Phaelhon
Athwart the realms of sky;
And spite of rarefaction
That leaves no breath to spare,
Records in weight aud measure
The secrets of the air.
When Paris lies close-fettered
in Prussia's iron grasp,
And outside friends, unlettered,
For tidings of her gasp—
Lo! where, par ballon monti,
The post bestrides the wind,
And leaves the Prussian bullets
And Uhlans far behind;
Though hard they ride, and harder
Pepper the big balloon,
What use to chase the swallow P
What use to shoot the moon P
O'er towers and tides, the Giant rides,
The east wind bloweth fair,
And, like the hopes of Paris, lo I
Her letters are en Voir.
But weightier freight balloons can bear
Than pent-up Paris' letters—
Lo! Minister Gamretta's self
Outaoaring Prussian fetters!
If ever there was vehicle
Well fitted for its freight,
'Tis this Gamretta chooses
For his chariot of estate—
Swollen with gas as airy
As his eloquence fanfaronne.
And as speedy in collapsing
As the hopes France builds thereon—
As a pin's-prick up-shrivels
The globe swell'd with the sun,
So, at truth's least touch, to nothing
Sinks his tale of triumphs won.
Then wonder not, if hopes and trusts,
That par ballon monli rise,
Like ballon erevi tumble,
All shattered, from the skies.
Descent of Education.
Have the horse-racing folk heard that there is war, and have their
literary gentlemen found it necessary to state war facts in a way com-
prehensible by the racing mind P We read last week, at the end of the
betting news, " Pax has been scratched."

MUCH A8 TAKIN' OF EACH OTHER IN, DON'T YOU KNOW?"
OUR AFTER-DINNER SONGSTERS.
Harmonious Mr, Punch,
Everyrody knows that nothin); in the way of public working
can be done witjiout a public dinner; and every body knows that nothing
in the way of public dining can be done without a vast amount of,
speech-making and singing. The singers are engaged to intervene I
between the speakers, so that when the latter are getting short of
breath, some respiration is secured them by the efforts of the former.
Yet the songs have, as a rule, but small connection with the speeches;
and I think that lyric poets and musical composers might supplant the
sentimental ditties of the drawing-room by something better suited to
the purpose of the dining-room. Say, for instance, that the dinner is
for charitable objects, here is a fair sample of the songs that might be
sung at it:—
Air—" Come, send round the Wine,"
Come, send round the hat, and with generous cheer,
The strings of your purse and your waistcoat extend;
'Tis charity yearly that gathers us here,
'Tis the cause of the friendless you're asked to befriend.
. No need of long speeches to say what we want,

THE ROYAL MARRIAGE.
Mr. Punch begs leave to make a distinguished bow to his excellent
(if Conservative) contemporary, the Bath Chronicle. That admirable
journal, the studies of whose Conductor are so evidently in a right
direction that the success of the paper is a matter of course, has turned
back to a somewhat remote Number of Punch, and has been amply
rewarded by lighting upon an article. which has been transferred to
the columns of the Bath Chronicle, with appropriate remarks, a portion
of which Mr. Punch has the utmost pleasure in reproducing.
"Twenty-one years ago, in the Number of Punch for February 3rd,
1849, the late Mr. Thackeray drew an imaginary picture of' England
in 1869,' in supposed extracts from the newspapers of the period. One
of thtse, under the heading of' Marriages of the Royal Family,' is so
applicable to the circumstances of' England in 1870,' that it, is worth
reproducing. The humorist Would have been amused himself had he
lived to »ee how nearly he hit the mark. The following is the para-
graph we refer to :—
'MarKiaoes of tur KotAL Family.—Why should our Trinces and
Princesses be compelled always to seek in Germany for matrimonial alliances:
Are the youths and maidens of England less beautiful than those of Saxe and
Prussia? Are the nobles of our own country, who have been free for
hundreds of yeats, who have shown in every clime the genius, the honour,
the splendour of Britain—art these, we ask, iu any way inferior to a Prince
(howevtr venerable) of 8jchs-8chlippchschloppen, or a Grand Duke of Pig-
witz-Gruntenstein? We <rotild breathe ho syllable of disrespect against these
potentates—we recognise in them as in ourselves the same Saxon blood—but
why, we ask, shall not Anglo-Saxon Princes or PrinoesseS wed with free
Anglo-Saxon nobles, themselves the descendants, if not the inheritors of
kings? We have heard ill the very highest quarters rumours which under
these impressions gits us the very sincerest delight. We have heard it stated
that the august mother and father of a numerous and illustrious race, whose
increase is dear to the h>n>l ttf every Briton, have determined no longer to
seek for German alliances for their exalted children, but to look St home for
establishments for those 10 dear to them. More would be at present premature.
We are not at liberty to mention particulars, but it is whispered that Heu
Royal HiOHNtss 1 hk Princess Boadicra is about to confer her royal hand
upon a young nobleman, who is eldest son of a noble peer who is connected
S' marriage with our noble and venerable Premier, with the Foreign and
lonial Secretaries, and With H. G. the Archbishop of Canterbury. The
same " little bird" also whispers that His Royal Highness, 1'kinck Henoist,
has cast an eye of princely approbation upon a lovely and accomplished young
lady of the highest classes, whose distinguished parents are "frae the North;
whose name is known and beloved throughout the wide dominions of Britain's
sway—in India, at the Admiralty, at the Home and Colonial Offices and in
both Houses of Parliament.'
"The first part of the prediction is being accomplished with a literal-
ness that should drive Zadkiel to despair. The Princess Louise, then
a baby not quite a year old, is betrothed to the eldest son of a noble-
man actually in office, wbo comes 'frae the North,' and whose name
is certainly known in India, seeing that he is and has for some time
been the Secretary of State for Indir. Moreover he is connected by
marriage with the Foreign Secretary, Earl Granville, for be married
a Gower, the Earl's first cousin, while as the head of the Campeells
he may claim cousinship with the Earl's second wife, Miss Camprell,
of Islay, as well as with the Archrishop of Cantereury, whose
mother was a Camfrell."
Mr. Punch is nleased, bat not surprised, to find this acknowledg-
ment. It is difficult to say what important or interesting event in
moder n history has not been foretold by his prescience, but it is not
the less agreeable to have that profound gift recognised, and, as afore-
said, he is pleased—but not proud.
HIGH JINKS.
The Board of Works are coming out, and going to have a little re-
laxation after their severe labours over sewers and embankments.
Christmas is approaching, and the rate-payers may look forward to
some agreeable musical evenings. Probably, the election of a new
Chairman will be celebrated by a series of delightful entertainments
consisting both of vocal and instrumental performances. We are sure
tbere will be a general feeling of satisfaction, when we announce the
gratifying fact, that at the Middlesex Licensing Sessions, the Court
acceded to an application for a music licence to be granted to the
offices of the Board of Works, Poplar district."
Nothing, we are certain, can make the Board more popular in East
London than such a proceeding as this: our only regret is that the
permission did not extend to dancing, feeling sure that the Members,
By strict regulations and constant personal attendance, would have
made the occurrence of any impropriety or indecorum an impossibility.
Thratricals.—The Fiji Islanders wire Cannibals. Now, we read
they have a Theatre. Among the first pieces played will probably be
the farce of " I've Eaten my Friend."
PUBLIC SERVANTS AND PAUPERS.
The following passage in the first of a series of Lectures on " Pau-
perism: its Causes ana Remedies," now in course of delivery by Pro-
pessor Fawcett, M.P., to Undergraduates at Cambridge, though
admirably correct, is not quite so complete as the Liberal and Learned
Professor might have chosen to make it:—
"There were two classes of poverty—there was voluntary poverty and
involuntary poverty. The former was that which man brought upon him-
self by vice, intemperance, or indolence, and which he had the power to
avert; while the latter was brought about by circumstances uncontrollable,
such as the improvidence of parents, failures in trade, or national calamities."
Or, Propessor Fawcett mifriit have added, "Ministerial retrench-
ments." That is, at least, if it is true that numerous workmen have
lately been discharged from employment in the dockyards, and clerks
in the War-Office and other Departments of the Public Service have
Ijeen dismissed from their situations without compensation equivalent
to that which ex-Chancellors receive, and which is also enjoyed of ex-
Prcmiers, and other Ministers gone OUt of office. Such unfortunate
persons as the former would of course comr under the head of invo-
luntary paupers, reduced to pauperism through redaction in national
expenditure. But there is some reason to doubt that any public
servants have been so pauperised, for Ministers, we may trust, would
never seek to curry public favour by »tt economy from the rigour of
whose paring they exempted themselves, and certainly they have not
yet proclaimed their intention to deprive themselves of retiring pensions.

PEACE TO l'HE PA PACK!
Your Priests the Temporal Popedora's fall
Lament, perhaps; your laity
Appear to miud it not at all:
It has not dashed their gaiety.
And who, except the greatest ass
That's kicking in Society;,
Can think 'twill interfere with Mass,
Or any act of piety P
Some Check to Capers.
By the refusal of dancing-licences to the proprietors of the Alhambra
and the Highbury Barn Tavern, the Middlesex Magistrates have in-
structed those who did not understand that a dancing-licence must
not be supposed to be a concession of licence in dancing. It may be
hoped that the Lord Chamrerlain will inculcate the same lesson on
certain managers under his jurisdiction. The graceful ballet is perhaps,
a thing of the past, irrevocable; but the ballet of the present, if devoid
of grace, might as well cease to be disgraceful.
A Word to the "Echo."
We say. The Echo is a sort of necessary of life, but it shouldn't
"sell" us. There was a sad scene at Brighton last week. The news-
boys bore a placard—" Horrid Scandal." The afternoon was lovely;
everybody on the Parade. The rush for the paper was —well, what
might be expected from Sydney Smith's "deboshed Brighton
Bathers." The Article proved to be on Mr. Trevelyan's admirable
Army Speech, in which he had used the above words! Comment
may be needless, but it wasn't thought so, on that Parade that lovely
afternoon.
On a Happy Couple.
They live like Dog and Cat, do Jack and Kitty,
And everybody knows it, more's the pity.
Kitty's rampagious like that Mrs. Gargery.
"Charming menage!" cries dinner-loving Fred.
Says truthful Tom, '' What's that you just now said f

Short and Sweet.
Dictionary words are long and Life is short. So auctioneers,
amongst other thrifty people, seem to think, by their abbreviating the
name of a well-known manufacturing town in a sale-bill of furniture
thus—" Brussels, Kidder, and other Carpets."
If this economical example is followed, we shall soon be familiar with
Stil cheese, Wit blankets, Epp sausages, Notting lace, Ever toffee, Nor
shawls, Sheff cutlery, Ban cakes, Bur ale, Devon cream, and so on.

"Kill 'em, Sir, kill 'em." Mr. Punch commends this venerable story
to the attention of the French authorities charged with the reception
of the Irish gentlemen who are volunteering as attendants on the
wounded. But perhaps the caution is needless. The valorous Hiber-
nians will scarcely stoop to the sick-bed. Their object is to make occu-
pants for sick-beds. The martial Galen from Ireland reminds us of
the Antiquary's quotation about his surgeon:—
"He came, but Valour ho had fired his eye,
And such a falchion glittered at his thigh,
That, by the Qoda, with such a load of steel,
I thought he came to Murder, not to Heal."
If a German officer should have reason to be of the same opinion, it
may go hard with a medical frane-tireur, and we fear that he will not
be much served by the plea that he did not particularly want to kill the
Germans, only that he thought it would spoite the Saxons.

FALL OF FORTIFICATIONS.
Hooray. Mr. Punch. Hooray! Good news! There is now some
prospect of a termination to the long eclipse of taste. The Morning
Post observes:—
"With the investment of Paris and the removal of the Empress the doom
of French rule in the world of fashion aeems to be pronounced as completely
as in the world of politics. At least, in Germany the imitation of France has
come to an end. ... As a first fruit, chignons hare been sacrificed by
the German ladies."
The proper study of mankind is man, especially woman. Its most
important branch 1 hold to be Phrenology. Now, for some years past,
there has been a grievous obstacle in the way of phrenological obser-
vation respecting the better half of mankind. It has been formed
partly by the chignon, situated so as to constitute a false Philo-
progeniliveness (love of infants, kittens, or puppies), partly by the
natural hair piled in turrets and fortifications over all the organs of the
moral sentiments, and brought down over the forehead so as to hide
the intellectual organs in the style of a charity-girl in Hogarth's
time, or after the manner represented in the portraits of Catherine
Hayes (burnt for murdering her husband). To examine a young lady's
head by inspection was impossible; it was necessary to take down the
superstructure on her upper storey, too often only to discover that it
concealed nothing to speak of but large Love of Approbation, which,
uncombined with Ideality, and undirected by intelligence, rendered
her the slave of fashion, and grotesque. It is some consolation for the
horrid display of Combativeness and Destructiveness of which France
has made her soil the arena, to hope that the fall of the chignon and its
adjoining fortifications will soon follow that of Metz. I am, Sir, a
disciple of Gall and Spurzhrim, at your service, and, when called by
my nickname, Jeremiah Bumps.

THB STOCKS MARKET.
At Newton, in Devonshire, the Magistrates are stated to have an-
nounced that they'intend, in future, to set in the stocks all drunkards
who cannot pay a fine. This is a step in the right direction, but Punch
does not like the condition. The Scots rhyme goes—
"Gin he have not gold to fine,
He hath shins to pine."
But is not this what cant-mongers love to call one law for the rich
and another for the poor P Why should a man be able to take out a
five-shilling licence to make himself a nuisance P Let us have no fines.
When " O, he was tipsy!" ceases to be an extenuating plea in Eng-
land, better times will come. By the way, England, by the last
returns, has only one drunkard for three in Ireland. Unless this means
that in Ireland the tipsy man is prosecuted, while in England he is not,
the fact is worth notice. Meantime, the Stocks, by all manner of

CELTICAL ADVERTISEMENTS.
Virtuous Mr. Punch,
Are Dramatic Critics paid by the Managers of theatres for
writing their advertisements f If not, [ really think in common justice
that they ought to be. Every day I find a column of my newspaper
made utterly unreadab!e by being filled with bits of criticism which 1
have read before, and which, to tempt the playgoers, are put forward
as advertisements. Should not the law of copyright, extend to the
effusions of the Critic's brain, as well as any other works of imaginative
fictionP Were 1 a Critic, I should add by way of postscript, to my
notices, " All rights of extraction and reprinting are reserved. For
terms apply to Editor, who will share the plunder."
It surely is not fair that Managers should get their advertisements
for nothing, and that the men who really write them should get, the ill
repute of being traded with as wholesale manufacturers of puffs. As
they so much abstain from dealing in anything but praise, Critics can-
not be astonished at, their earning this repute; and by way of compen-
sation for their getting a bad name, they at least may hope to pocket a
good substantial recompense.
To be sure they have another course, which some may think a wiser
one; namely that of putting rather facts than fiction in their criticism,
and of using well-galled ink iustead of rose-water and treacle. If only
for its novelty, such a course as this would be pretty certain to find
favour with the public; and depend on it, if Critics were to tell plain
truths, we should not see so many extracts from their writings paraded
as advertisements.
As it is, the public loses confidence in criticism, and judges, or per-
haps misjudges, for itself. Playgoers grow too wise to be caught by
the catch lines of the "Opinions of the Press," knowing them to be,
only nine times out of ten, the echoes of opinions of the Managers.
Joining you in all good wishes for the welfare of the Stage, which I
fear will not be furthered by these critical advertisements, I subscribe
myself, Yours hopefully,

self-reliance, is visible, and there is the legend HlSTORlCUS I.

CIGARETTE PAPERS.
PAPER.—MY AUNT'S GREAT

ow, my Aunt had something
left her by Somebody. She
was under the impression
that she bad only to mention
the fact to another Some-
body somewhere in t he City,
and she would get it.
On making the applica-
tion to this Somebody in the
City, who turned out to be
a Company, and Limited,
she was informed that she
couldn't get her money
for at least three months.
Whereupon she sent to
her banker, and informed
him that she couldn't have
the money for three months
At the end of three mont hs
she wrote to the banker,
who wrote to the Company
Limited, and the Company
Limited, in the politest
manner possible, wrote to
him, and asked for the
necessary papers.
Then the banker referred
the question to my Aunt.
"Goodness!" said my
Aunt, who began to see difficulties," Do they take me for a swindler P
It then struck her that the Limited was pretending to forget her
claim; so she found the papers. Having sent these to her banker, and
her banker having forwarded them to the Company Limited, the politest
possible message was returned, to the effect, that, though the papers
were perfectly satisfactory as far at they went (" Do they think l'mi
forger f" exclaimed my Aunt indignantly), yet it was absolutely neces-
sary that she should take out Letters of Administration.
"Now, what Letters of Administration are, or how you take them
out, or where you take them out to, I know no more," said my Aunt,
helplessly, "than the Man in the Moon."
Hitherto my Aunt had always received her dividends regularly, had
not entered into investments, or buying, or selling, and had never been
an Administratrix. Being suddenly placed in that position, the ordinary
calm of her life seemed to have vanished.
On receiving this fresh advice from the City concerning the Letters
of Administration, she thought over the matter all the morning, made
nothing of it, came to a decision, and telling her maid (she lives in
lodgings with her maid) to get a cab, she drove down to see me.
1 am her resort in difficulties. She is under the impression that,
because I happened to-have been called to the Bar, and read in a Con-
veyancer's chambers, I must be thoroughly acquainted with the Law,
and, as a relation, will ftive her good sound advice, thus obviating a
consultation with a solicitor, which she associates, indistinctly and
generally, with the Police Courts, Old Bailey, and witness boxes.
1 don't want to have anything to do with Law, my dear," says she
to me. "But 1 don't mind coming to you," which, seeing that 1
am a barrister, is scarcely complimentary to my legal knowledge.
Perhaps she little knows,—in fact I am sure she little knows what a
very small amount of Law I managed to bring away from the Temple
and Lincoln's Inn in exchange for regular payments for dinners
(which, after the first few indispensable ones, I never ate), attendance
on Lecturers (where I made some very pleasant acquaintances, and got
through a deal of light literature), a wig, a gown (sold afterwards at a loss
to a friend), some law books, enormous precedent books (which subse-
quently became account-books, scrap-books, odds-and-ends books),
and a hundred pounds to a Conveyancing Barrister for the privilege of
having a place to sit in, when 1 visited Lincoln's Inn, in the company
of four other pleasant young gentlemen of more or less studious habits,
but having very clear ideas on the subject of luncheon at one o'clock
daily.
If that Conveyancer had ever called me into his room, and in a fit of
remorse had said, " You paid a hundred pounds to learn something;
you have learnt nothing. Here is your hundred pounds," 1 should
tiave looked upon him as a man doing nothing more than bis duty. By
what legal quibble he ever justified himself to himself for keeping my
money is a puzzle to me. But I suppose he went by precedent, that
being his rule in all possible cases.
So my Aunt (who, by the way, is the real sufferer in this case, as it
was her hundred pounds) comes to me on every occasion when she
requires legal advice, taking this as a sort of interest for her money
invested.
She drives down in a Hansom cab (" Four-wheelers and Fevers begin
with F," she says) to my retired cottage, about ten miles out of town,
and the driver puts up " during the consultation.
The consultation lasts for four hours, including the dinner hour, and
the result is that " she must consult a solicitor."
The consultation (with me) consisted of her showing me the banker's
letters, the Company's replies, her letters, then her written suspicions
of the Company, then explanations as to her fear that the banker
wasn't taking much trouble about the matter, then of her anxiety lest
some other claimant, some other Administrator, might step in (this was
her great fear), and claim the whole sum, whatever it was. "In which
case," she continued, "you know there would be law proceedings;
and," she added, with some amount of family pride, and with a view
to the interest on the aforesaid Conveyancer's hundred pounds," you
could appear for me." We then got out a Law Dictionary (date 1720),
and she was much impressed by the article headed " Administrators,"
extracts from which she took to be the part of the results of my vast
legal erudition, and consequently as so much interest on her capital to
which she was enlitled.
The consultation being finished, the cab was sent for.
The process of "putting up " for several hours had had a consider-
able effect on the driver, who, on being asked if he recollected the
address he had driven from in the afternoon (it, was now past ten at
night), replied, hazily, " Hightchar," meaniug, it is supposed, "Right
you are;" adding an exhortation to my Auut to " Step up, will yer P"
"That man is drunk," I said, judicially, to the servant. The servant
was uncertain. A friend stopping with us agreed with me, but was
inclined to give turn a chance. My Aunt didn't believe in his inebriety,
but proposed some theory about the night-air and the uncertain light.
The man himself denied the imputation warmly.
Not wishing for a row (which means, in a general way, "having my
head punched "), I assisted my Aunt into t he cab.
We wished, her good-bye, but stood waiting to see the start.
This was a difficulty, owing to the driver being unsettled in his mind
as to where the road was. First he pulled the reins so as to back the
cab against the palings; then (still explaining to us from his perch
that he was only "trying to take the best turning") he pulled the
horse round with the right rein, which, resulting in no progress at all,
he changed for the left.
Upon this, we beseeched my Aunt to get out, the man being, unques-
tionably, drunk.
The driver, hearing this, vehemently contradicted us, and attempted
to explain that the horse couldn't go on straight because the reins were
twisted.
"Untwist them then, you idiot," said my friend. I wished at the
moment he wouldn't call the man names, or if he did that he wouldn't
stand safely inside our gate and do it, where the man couldn't see him,
and would think I'd done it. The driver, however, didn't notice this;
but descended from his seat (a dangerous and perfectly unnecessary
operation), in order to adopt my friend's advice and untwist them.
All he did was to tug at the horse's head and swear a little, which
prorably relieved his brain considerably, as he was able to climb up
again, after not more than three false slips. Again on his box,
his pulling at the unfortunate animal's hetd became more violent,
when, seeing him about to back into the ditch, we rushed towards the
cab and received mv Aunt in our arms, anyhow, like a parcel out of a
van at a luggage office.
Then we shut the gate on the man, and left him. He rang the bell
at intervals for an hour afterwards; but, attracting no attention, he
left off, and somehow or another, drove away. How far he got, or if he
ever reached London at all that night, is to this day a matter of great
uncertainty. My Aunt stopped with us that night, and next morning
went to her solicitor.
Some days afterwards she came down again, this time in a fly.
"Letters of Administration P" I asked.
"No, my dear!" she exclaimed, in an almost fainting state. "I'm
summoned!"
"Summoned!" I exclaimed.
"Yes," she said, "to a Police Court. Thai Cabman! To-morrow I

THE "NIOBE OP NATIONS."
In the lone Lydian hills, the traveller, spent
With heat and travel, comes on a strange thing—
At once a mountain and a monument—
The Niobe, of whom old poets sing,*
How, in her pride of sons and daughters fair,
She boasted her Latona's self above—
The Titaness, who dazzlinr Phoebus bare,
And milder Artemis, to Zeus his lov
Saving, "I have borne many, thou but two;
Nor thine like mine, for beauty and for strength."
At first Latona smiled, as one that knew
Her greatness, but to hot wrath roused at length,
Called her son Phcebus of the golden shaft,
Her daughter Dian of the silver bow,
Who not alone to scorn the boaster laughed,
But with their arrows laid her children low.
Day and night, shafts of gold and silver sung
Through Sipylus out of Cithseron's shade;
In vain her hands the tortured mother wrung.
In vain for mercy the vexed goddess prayed—
Son after son, stricken past help or hope,
Fell, in her sight, 'neath that resistless rain;
For daughter after daughter she might ope
The loving shelter of her arms, in vain!
• See Van Lennep's Travels in Asia Minor for the startling Mcount of the
stone face, with its torrent-furrowed cheeks, still to be seen in -the region of the
ancient Sipylus.
And still they fell, and still she wept and wept,
Till woe her eyes' light into water drew,
And sorrow through her.life-blood freezingcrept,
That slowly to a thing of stone she grew.
To'this day travellers may see, aghast,
In Sipylus that giant face of stone,
With eyes now stony, but whose tears have traced
Dank rifts, with torrents wet, and moss o'ergrown.
And Niobe has grown a name for grief
That weeps and weeps, and will not be consoled:
The " Niobe of Nations, she, whom chief
Of all lands men for bitter sorrow hold.
This heavy crown of suff'ring that is shame
Has oft changed brows: Italy wore it long:
It was for her a poet made the name;
For her, whose age with new life now grows strong.
Lo, who is "Niobe of Nations" now!
She that was thought so strong and was so proud,
Whose armed and sceptred hand and haughty Drow
Once o'erawed Europe, at her footstool bowed.
What ends of earth heard not her vaunt of race P
Whose sons were like hers, in her own esteem f
Whose daughters equalled hers for charm and graoe P
Chief her Lntetia!—whose beauty's beam
From far and wide enthralled adorers drew
To lie at her fair feet, and drink the breath
Of perfume on her lips, although they knew
Her beauty baleful, and their fragrance death.

Where in the North her wrath and strength she nursed,

And when the boaster struck her in the face,
Her pent-up rage to giant action bunt,
And she called forth her potent progeny
And bade them set their arrows to the string,
And smile the boaster's children, hip and thigh:
And they obeyed the call, stern, swift of wing,
Confirmed and clear of purpose, silent, strong,
And while the boaster's challenge sounded shrill,
Their well-aimed arrows whistled, loud and long,
And one of those proud sons lay stiff and still.
And as the strife began so it went on,
Death-dealing conquest, helpless wrath and woe,
Unseen shafts launched unguarded flanks upon,
Aimless resistance, abject overthrow!
Till France, like Niobe, mid slaughtered sons
And death-struck daughters, sits and sobs alone,
While from her eyes grief's river runs and runs,
And for sheer woe her heart seems turned to stone,
That she can neither fight, nor bow the head,
Submissive, to ask mercy of her foe,
And bid the slayer hold his hand, nor shed

The Suez Canal has been open now for some time, but the commu-
nication thus established has not occasioned any spirits to be laid in
the Red Ser. The spirits of Spiritualism, though their raps make little
noise outside of spiritual "circles," are still rapping away, and doing
things yet more wonderful; at least, so we are told. But they de-
cline publicity. Although they, some of them, are affirmed to have
stretched a gentleman, whom they possessed, several inches, they would
not stretch a point so far as to come into Court on his behalf at need,
and attest his good faith. They never will come into Court, or allow
themselves to be brought to book by any crucial test. Clearly
the nature of things spiritual and things natural is not the same nature
of things. There is a corresponding difference between Spiritualists
and Philosophers. The Philosophers have no familiar spirits of the
disembodied kind; know only distilled, and their familiarity with such
as whiskey is sometimes rather too thick. With Spiritualists the reverse
is the case. The Medium, a Spiritualist weekly newspaper, says:—
"Spiritualists and progressives of all kinds little realise how much they are
indebted to the Temperance movement, which was a beginning of the gTeat
work of human redemption which Spiritualism is now carrying on to greater
and higher consummations. The leading Spiritualists almost everywhere are
staunch Teetotallers, and in many instances the Temperance Society is the
door through which Spiritualism reaches the people. A few months ago
J. Buhns gave a lecture on Spiritualism to a Temperance Society in Peckham;
and on bis last vi»it to Glasgow, two years ago, he lectured to a large meeting
of the Working Men's Society, Candleriggs, Glasgow—one of the best in Scot-
land—his topic being a combination of Teetotalism and Spiritualism."
Apparently the mental condition or temperament which constitutes
the Teetotaller also constitutes the Spiritualist. Both the one and the
other, or the two in one, seem to be naturally and usually in a state of
elevation which a Philosopher could not attain unto,
"He kept his spirits up
By pouring spirits
To wit, whiskey as aforesaid, brandy, gin, or rum; but spirits of another
order are sufficient to screw up the Spiritualist to a similar pitch of
tension, not to say tightness. The Number of the Medium above
quoted contains accounts of seances at which communications were
received from Henry VIIL, Walter Scott, Dante, the late Captain
Burgotne, Handel, Charles 11., George IV., the late Dran Mil-
man, Sir Christopher Wren, Grinling Gierons, John Knox,
Queen Elizaerth, Ludwio Spohr, Captain Cowper Coles, Mar-
garet Waters, Arthur Pelham Clinton, Joan op Arc, Oliver
Cromwell, Madame Vestris, Julius Caesar, and Liston the Actor.
Dipsomania and Teetotalism, combined as it is with Spiritualism, are
extremes which sometimes appear to meet on the plane of delirium
tremens.
Probably the lecturer abovenamed, Mr. J. Burns, has had a message
from his namesake Korert, recommending barley-water. What does

M. Victor Hugo has issued a glowing appeal to the proprietors of
all menageries, imploring them to let loose upon the Prussian monsters
the nobler brutes of the forest. He apologises to the latter.
The Rhine, swollen by the rains, has risen to such an extent that
the communications between the enemy and Prussia are entirely cut off,
and a fleet of French gunboats has been launched to take the invaders
in rear. Their surrender can be but a matter of days.
A new " Joan of Arc " has arisen at Tours. The inhabitants have
contributed their plate to make her a suit of silver armour, and she
will take the field at the head of a regiment of Amazons. Enthusiasm
is at its highest, and victory is certain.
The Archrishop op Nanct, who had fallen into the hands of the
enemy, was iucautiously permitted to preach on Sunday last. His de-
nunciation of the sin of the Catholic soldiers of Germany, in allying
themselves with Protpstants against a Catholic power, produced such
an effect that 123,371 immediately re-crossed the Rhine, and went
home.
Twelve thousand Prussians were singing a Protestant hymn in the
church of St. Samson, near Verdun, when a patriotic sexton, enraged
at the desecration, placed a powder-barrel near the tower, which fell at
the explosion. Every Prussian perished.
The entire garrison of Paris made a sortie last night and rushed

WAR NOTES.
(From our Chen Cockalorum.) Vertailles
P'raps you didn't get anything from this Gay Militaire last Toosday,
which it were.
The fact is, times is changed with this Noble Marquis, and he thinks
of returning; to the home of his ancestors, passing, on his way, through
the Little Village.
I've just received a wire to say that I 've collared the stuff, and
skinned the tender lambkin on Adonis for the Cambridgeshire.
If true, the light of other days has not faded, and the glories of the
past will be once more for Yours Truly.
However, old scores first, and then a gay investment in some light-
hearted Eleven per Cent, affair, paid quarterly, and your experienced
Mihtaire will be quite the Commercial.
Your Own has done the trick in more ways than one, and if he don't
fill his spoon now he never will. On the Hereditary Crown's natal
day, this Happy Warrior was there, and what do you think was the
present which Your Own presented to the Crown Cockalorum P
Neat and appropriate: it was a neat little electro-plated scoop for coals.
Engraved upon it was "To the Crown Cockalorum, from His Own
Lighthearted Soldier, in memory of being on the Scoop," which we
were with Papa Villi; m, who can't get his hymn tunes right again
somehow, but has 'em mixed up with We won't go home till morn-
ing " and " Champagne Charley," which this Harmonious Blacksmith
taught him.
"Captain," said the Crown Cockalorum, grasping my off paw, and
bursting with such emotion as heaved up his manly chest like machinery,
"Captain," says he, "you're another."
When two Gay Gallants weep on each other's shoulders it's time to
shut up and go home. So you don't get any more; not from me,
George.
Leaving the gay and festive, and halls of dazzling, I walked down
the street with just twopenn'orth of swagger on, and sporting my linen
in the flashing of the midday sun.
When these eyes fell on a beautiful creature. Dressed in the latest
Parisian, with as much foot before as behind, and heels in the middle.
A regular duster, Sir. There was the classic bend and the line of
beauty all there, with the curve of beauty belonging to a note of inter-
rogation, while this Light-hearted Don Juan rime after with a note or
two of admiration.
She was what this Lion-hearted Warrior admires; in fact, Your
Washup, the lovely damsel was suited to the meanest capacity (as they
say of the portable somethings in the advertisements), and was just
about my figure.
As she walked along in front of this impressionable Dragoon, she put
no end of side on, and it's tide, now-a-days, that knocks you silly.
A girl who puts side on, judiciously, nils you high up on the left, you
undercumstumble, and sends you into the pocket, or up, sharp, against
the cushion.
Side does it, Sir. _ She goes along quite straight, but her intention is
towards the red (this Gay Militaire, for example), whom she passes on
her way. Then she comes back off the cushion, and "side" brings her
right up against you. "You meet, 'tis in a crowd," and there you
are.
Watch a girl with side on, and you'll get a lesson in feminine diplo-
macy which you won't forget in a hurry, and thank this Gay Militaire
for it.
"O poor Lucy Neal, O poor Lucy Neal, if you'1l just put on the
side, how happy I shall feel," which is a new chanson by Your Own.
Now, your Washup, if, in addition to my collaring the stuff on
Adonis, you hear of anything Hymeneal between this gay Son of Mars
and a lovely Prooshian, or Parisian Venus (for Parisian she may be, and
well out of it), then you'1l know that Scoops are over and Tittups are
no more; but quite the domestic will be henceforth the character of
your Roving Soldier, if he goes in for the Nursery Stakes.
Perhaps the venture ain't pood enough for me.
Lookout. I'm a-coming. Never be surprised at anything, until
you find a blackbird's nest in your right ear. Then you may wink.
Yours ever, Your Own, Dtngwell.
Melancholy Casualty in the City.
We deeply regret to state that a Stock Exchange wit came to great
grief on Tuesday week. He had read in the Standard that the dock-
yard at Woolwich was to be turned into an Army clothes-store. He
thought he saw a splendid epigram. "You see, 'Arut," he exultingly
remarked to a friend, "that s just the thing. They can make cloth out
of the Wool-which is there. Comprenny P 'Akry did not see it, and
they have not spoken since.
An Interdict.—No Teetotaller will allow the works of Pope to
enter his house, because of the encouragement that poet has given to
intemperance in urging people to " Drink deep."

PUNCH'S ESSAYS.
I.—STATISTICS.
"For there is figures in all things."—Henry V.
"Give your nights and days to statistics," was the advice the elder
Pitt tendered to his second son, William, on entering the public
service, in which he subsequently rose to such great distinction. The
greatest happiness I have known in life has been derived from the
Arabic numerals," writes Junins's Duke of Grapton to the poet Gray.
"Think less of your figure, and more of your figures," was what
Sheridan said to Lord Eldon, after they had been dininsr together
at the "Blue Posts," to celebrate the revision of the Tariff. "Your
head runs on figures of speech, your whole time is engrossed with
the figures of the quadrille, your sole aim and ambition is to cut
a figure in socie1y. You are wrong—utterly, entirely, completely
wrong: the only figures that a man of taste and pleasure and fashion
should care to know are those to be found in the returns issued by
order of both Houses of Parliament. Study those, and the highest
and most lucrative posts in the State are open to you and your family
connections/' Such was Lord Chesterfield's affectionate counsel
to his son, and he never remembered it, even in the smallest hours.
But it hardly needs this accumulated weight of unimpeachable testi-
mony, and the unanimous verdict of history, society, and posterity,
the German Zollverein, the Saxon Wittenagemot, and the Spanish In-
quisition, to confirm a deep-seated belief, the origin of which is probably
lost in the mists and fogs of time, that in Statistics a man possesses
the surest solace in misfortune or on a wet morning.
To know the exact number of eggs which have been produced by the
French silkworms since the abdication of Charles the Tenth, or the
money value of our own exports of Shrewsbury cakes and Ormskirk
gingerbread during the last quarter of a century; to be able to state,
with some approach to numerical accuracy, how many guests have
partaken of civic hospitality in the Guildhall of London, from the age
of Whittinoton to the more enlightened era of Besley; to compute
the square miles of gas which are being consumed in all the cities and
towns of Great Britain on the longest night in the year; to compare
the number of red-haired men and black-haired men now living in
affluence in the Cantons of Switzerland, and to deduce therefrom some
positive theories as to the influence of colour on national and individual
idiosyncrasies; to count the stops in Shakespeare, giving the respective
totals of commas, colons, and periods; to work out the dimensions of
a column, such as would be raised if all the eggs could be brought
together which have been consumed since their use as an article of
food was first entered at Stationers' Hall; or, finally, to average the
hairs in the tails of the chargers of a regiment of Household Cavalry—
these are indeed delightful tasks to interest childhood, to enchant
youth, to engross adult leisure, to fascinate middle age, to soothe
and console declining life, and to constitute an ample qualification for
the Fellowship of the Statistical Society.
Figures never pall. The flavonr of wine, the savour of meats, the
smiles of beauty, the lures of ambition, the excitement of commercial
speculation, the stimulus of literary renown, the attractions of field
sports and hot suppers, each and all in time and turn lose their power
and popularity, cease to charm, and fail to please; but Statistics know
no satiety: averages cannot weary, or calculations forget their piquant
zest, and often as " tables" are prepared and got ready, as often do
they find devotees who, with eager looks and sparkling eyes, and some
share of arithmetical ability, are impatient to enjoy and digest their con-
tents, with no abatement of sober relish, and without any apparent
diminution of honest appreciation. Be, then, a statistician, and you
will ensure the respect of all the people La your neighbourhood, and
live to an advanced age.
WEEDS OF THE FUTURE.
An American journalist says :—
"Scientific men have recently discovered that the poison taken into the
system from continual smoking of tobacco will cause death in one hundred
and sixty-seven years. We warn our readers who have been smoking nearly
that time to break themselves of the habit at once."
Punch is obliged to his contemporary for the hint. It is a little pre-
mature, as the first-mentioned gentleman has been smoking only for
about thirty years. But he has bought a Letts for a.d. 2007, and
has entered a memorandum, " Begin to restrict myself, next year, to
eighteen cigars per diem." He will publish an account of any phe-
nomena that may attend his change of diet.
Instruction in Science Wanted.
Mrs. Malaprop, who has lately removed to the neighbourhood of
King's Cross, was terribly alarmed at the Great Northern Lights, and
conld not be convinced that it was not the Station on fire. The neigh-
bours, she declares, say eccentricity is the cause of them.
SKETCHING AN EMPRESS.
At last we have got some valuable War-news. We have elaborate
details touching the most interesting personage whose fortunes have
been mixed up with the great events of the time. Bomebody has
obtained an interview with the Empress Ecgkwie; and this is the
report. Let it be carefully and reverently studied, item by item. For,
as Mr. Carlyle says, every fact hath its assignable value in this
world.
Firstly, let us know the colour of Her Majesty's dress.
"Her Majesty was dressed in a brown walking costume. The petticoat was
of brown siln, trimmed with three flounces of velvet, over which she wore a
tunic and jacket of brown merino of the finest texture. The tunic was
trimmed with flounces of silk of the same shade; the jacket, like the petti-
coat. Was trimmed with velvet. It was a simple little jacket, fitting her
lovely shoulders most perfectly, slashed at the sides and back, and trimmed all
round with one row of velvet ribbon an inch and a-half wide."
Observe—an inch and a half. No hasty generalisation, no *' about,"
no careless description. An inch and a half. Give some writers an
inch—and so forth—but there is conscientiousness here, nothing said
for the sake of being graphic.
But now—this is a time of cuffs—let us hear of the Empress's.
"At the wrists were deep pointed cuffs, with little gold buttons extending
from the bottom of the sleeve to the point of the cuff, and at the neek a small
velvet collar. The tunic was very full, and was looped up most gracefully.
Around her throat she wore a white tie with a large bow in front. It was
trimmed with Brussels lace."
Brussels lace. This is—though the absorbed Writer does not see it—
a proof of the Empress's good taste. We know that she has abstained
from all interference with Prance since her exile, and her very trimming
is from a neutral city, not Valenciennes. We marvel that the reporter
could not notice this.
Now for the gloves and umbrellr.
"Her gloves were silk, very long at the wrists, of a light buff colour. Her
sun umbrella was of the same shade of buff, lined with green silk. She wore
a small black straw hat, bound around the brim with black silk. The brim
was narrow and drooping. On the left side was a large black bow. Her veil
was of black thread lace. In her right hand she carried a substantial brown
wood cane, of which she made good use as a walking stick."
The account is evidently by a lady, and not by a man—not even a
man-milliner. But had the reporter been one of the coarser sex, we
should certainly have expressed a regret that some stalwart masculine
attendant on the exiled lady, of whom stock was thus being taken, did
not make still better use of the last above-mentioned article. But the
kind of note-taking that would be despicable in a man, is amusing in
a nobler being. We go on, and hear that the Empress
"Wore no jewellery of any kind."
How much jewellery does a " real lady " usually wear when taking
a walk in her own garden P Moreover, as the Empress wore gloves,
the reporter must have come very close indeed to say that Her Majesty
had no rings. Here only we detect a flaw in a delightful narrative;
but let it pass:—
'"The ladies of Her Majesty's suite wore black hats similar to that of the
Emphess. They all wore silk petticoats, with tunics and jackets of some other
material. Some of them carried canes like the Empress, and those who did
not carried their umbrellas as suck. The gentlemen wore dark grey trousers,
black coats, and round-toed boots."
We do not profess to understand the words in Italics. As it did not
rain, the ladies did not put up their umbrellas: but what is meant by
carrying them "as such," we leave to wiser persons to explain.
Finally, we rejoice in the gentlemen's round-toed boots, as they show
that Her Majesty's attendants are cheerful, and not of the sort we call
"Old Square-Toes."
On the whole, we seem to lack words to describe the satisfaction
with which we hive read this truly English mode of showing respect
to a lady, an exile among us, distinguished no less by her grace in
good times than her courage in bad ones. No naturalist, describing
some newly-discovered creature, could be more ruthlessly exact than
an English reporter who had the good luck to come upon a Royal lady,
dressed in ordinary morning attire, and taking a private walk. But
there must be creatures, not .newly discovered, who like this sort of
thing, or it would not be done.
Dammartin.
Rarelais tolls us of "the Castle of Dammartin, whicu burstod with
laughter." Commentators have been baffled by the passage. Perhaps
the castle was built, as was Notre Dame, according to Victor Hugo,
hv a magician, and had instincts. Perhaps it foresaw the addresses which
Victor Hugo would make in 1870. Yet a patriotic Castle ought not
to have laughed—even Englishmen laugh only with protest and regret.

"THE MAIDEN ALL FOB-LORNE."
"Tort, my faithful Secretary," said Mr. Punch on Saturday last,
"push me that cigar-case. Now, inform me, Tort, to the best of your
recollection, how many letters, addressed to your Master, have you
opened, and found to contain what the writers are pleased to consider
a joke upon"
"Please not to repeat it, Sir," said Tory, with a shudder. "That
joke is my nightmare."
"Like a dog, you hunt in dreams, eh, my faithfulP But that there
may be no mistake in your answer to my question, be it understanded

race behaved atrociously to an unoffending, and, indeed, meritorious
cat."
"And the dog was tossed by a cow who was milked by a Maiden all

his duty.
"That is the joke, Tory. Now then. How many British Wits have

"Up to this morning, Sir, the batches make up 597, besides postal

by the last balloon post that this mischievous
magpie has been silenced—by the most ap-
propriate means, ridicule and contempt.

ours to be quite so much of a pattern post as
we have hitherto thought it.
MYCOPHAGY AND MYCOLOGY.
Sweet Mr. Punch,
How do you think you would have relished the repast men-
tioned in the subjoined extract from a newspaper 1' One can imagine
it to have been the counterpart of a genuine " Dinner after the Manner
of the Ancients "; particularly the Ancient Romans :—
"Perth.—Sooietv of Natural Science.—At a meeting of the Perth-
shire Society of Natural Science, held on Friday evening, a paper was read
by Mr. Saddler, assistant to Professor Balfour, Edinburgh, entitled
'Contributions to the Flora of Perthshire,' and one by Dr. Buchanan Whitr,
President of the Society, on 'Sugaring for Moths.' After the meeting, the
members adjourned to the Moncrieffe Arms Hotel, where supper was prepared,
consisting of different species of funguses, cooked in almost every conceivable
manner. The dishes most relished were Boletus edulis, Coprinus comatus, and
Agaricus campestris."
"Sunt tibi boleti,fungos ego sumo suillos." Your friend Martial (I don't
mean Captain Dyng well) drew a distinction not understood by modern
mycologists and mycophagists. Every boletus nowadays is a fungus,
though not every fungus is a boletus. Of course you know that a great
variety of funguses are eatable; but few Britons dare venture upon
any but the Common Mushroom (Agaricus campestris above named).
Very likely their fear may be heightened by apprehension of injury to
their teeth in table-talk over things with such crackjaw names as
those of which the foregoing are mild examples. It is an exertion,
for epicures at least, to articulate them. You may find no difficulty in
saying Tricholona gambosus, Amanita strobili/ormis, or Lepiota procerus.
But some of your readers will have a little. However, there is no help
for it. We have hardly any trivial name for any fungus but the
Common Mushroom aforesaid. The Marasmius Oreades is called in
English-French " Champignon," the Caniharellus abarius, in the same
tongue, " Chantarelle "; we name theMorckella esculenta Morel," and
tbe Tuber mstivum "Truffle," but otherwise almost every fungus which
the people do not call a Mushroom, they call a Toadstool. The Boletus
edulis enjoyed by the Perthshire naturalists would be "to the general"
a toadstool of the fattest and most frightful species; the more knowing
inhabitants of Bordeaux regale themselves upon it as a delicacy under
the name of rep, so called, 1 fancy, because thereabouts it likes to grow
at the foot of the vine. They, yon see, don't make a mouthful of the
word, but they eat the thing. Do likewise if ever you have a chance,
which you may have eaily next summer, please Jupiter Pluvius, and, if
you like, you can also explore the woodlands and see where it grows,
with other things of the same sort equally good, no less tough to the
organs of speech and equally tender to the nerves of taste, if you will
vouchsafe to be guided by your ancient Smelfunous
A TELEGRAM WITH A TWIST.
The Aurora Borealis must have played some strange pranks, not to
say " Old Gooseberry," with the wire which, the other day, transmitted
the following telegram from Lille :—
"An aeronaut who left Paris on the 27th, arrived here to-day. His bal-
loon descended at Metz, in the midst of the Prussian lines on Thursday, and
he was obliged to burn his despatches and fly through Belgium. No official
reports have, therefore, been received."
What were the Prussians about to let this French aeronaut, whose
balloon fell in the midst of their lines, burn his despatches and fly through
BelgiumP How chanced they not to secure his despatches, and to
make himself prisoner P It is impossible to understand, except on the
supposition that when the balloon fell be was not in it. Had he, then,
previously flown away to Belgium through the air P If so, he might,
one would think, have carried his despatches with him, and need not
have burned them. This telegram requires explanation.
Aqueous Attraction.
Smiles may have been occasioned by a contemporary in publishing
the subjoined announcement:—
"Bournemouth.—This fashionable wstering-plaee is full to overflowing,
and almost every house has been engaged for the winter months."
One cannot help thinking that a watering-place, full to overflowing,
must be rather too damp to be pleasant.
The Amazon* of the Seine.
M. Allix, the Secretary of the Amazons, was once famous for a
project of telegraphy by sympathetic snails. He seems now to have
transferred his hopes from snails in the hands of men, to slugs in the
arms of ladies.

MILITARY ENJOYMENT.
itu regard to our pro-
posed military reorgani-
sation, an article in the
Morning Post contains
the following remark:—
"We have never enjoyed
a system under which it
would be possible at once
and at any time to put into
the field, and to maintain
in its strength, a large and
reliable army."
No, we certainly never
have enjoyed such a sys-
tem, and it is most cer-
tain we never shall. It
may, indeed, be that a
system of that descrip-
tion will, one of these
days be established by
an efficient British Gov-
ernment. Bat when we
have got it, we shall cer-
tainly not enjoy it. We,
the people at large, every
one of us, shall have
either to serve in the
large and trustworthy
(not to talk Yankee) army which that system will have provided us with, or else
to pay for it—perhaps to do both. , We shall enjoy neither of these necessities; and
the two together will amount to an unspeakable bore. People who enjoy soldiering
are peculiarly constituted. They are either insensible to the pain and inconveni-
ence which the rest of mankind experience from wounds and mutilations, or in-
capable of conceiving unpleasant sensations before they actually feel them. Those
who enjoy soldiering also enjoy cold, hunger, and fatigue, or at least contemplate
the endurance of those incidents to it with unconcern:—
"I do agnize
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness."
Everybody who enjoys soldiering must agnize the same alacrity as General
Othello. But the greater part of us agnize no such thing. We mostly agnize a
natural and prompt alacrity in eating, drinking, sleeping, smoking, and otherwise
gratifying desires and tastes, which, though some of them intellectual and moral,
are all related to a general quality of objects which is essentially softness. If we
become a nation of soldiers, we shall not thank the foreigners, whose truculent
and rapacious propensities will have forced us thereto, for any enjoyment.
Suffering will be our lot under any military system on a scale extensive enough
to furnish us with an army nearly as large as one of theirs, and equal to keeping
down the dangerous classes abroad,—in other words the chief European nations.
We shall enjoy that system of military organisation as much, and as completely,
as an invalid enjoys bad health.

GREAT NEWS FOR LITTLE PEOPLE.
TO SHORT PERSONS.—Any one (Male or Female) wishing to increase in
Height and Symmetry of Figure, by means of a remarkable physiological discovery,
may send a stamped directed envelope to Captain • • • • • (U.S.), • • • • London,
H.W.
How to grow stout, how to grow thin, how to secure a beautiful complexion,
how to preserve a luxuriant head of hair, how to get rid of blotches, pimples,
freckles, warts, and other distracting blemishes, how to prevent sea-sickness, now
to guard our eyes, our ears, our hands, our feet, our skin, our teeth, and our
voice, from a thousand and one imperfections—we have all been advertised over
and over again, until it seemed as though there was no natural defect left for the
ingenuity of man to remedy.
We were mistaken, for here is an American Captain (U.S. stands for United
States, not for Under Size), from Long Island, we suppose, who, in exchange
for the modest fee of "a stamped directed envelope," is eager to instruct those
of us who are troubled with shortness of stature, who are living on, dumpy and
atumpv—it may be with darkened prospects and blighted affections, all through
the affliction, hitherto thought to be incurable, of five feet four—how to grow
taller, how "to increase in height and symmetry of figure," how to escape the
gibes and jeers which are cast on the small and lowly, how to qualify for the Army,
the Police, the Constabulary, how—greatest happiness of all—to become acceptable
to those fair, capricious beings who have a passion for six feet, and so snub and
discourage little men that they are driven to despair and high heels. "High
heels "—perhaps that is Captain * * * * *'s specific: if so, the bootmaker will
supply it without the formality of "a stamped directed envelope."
There is only one more "physiological discovery" to be made—how to grow
shorter. Let not the inconveniently tall, the gawkies, the Maypoles, despair.
An American philanthropist has appeared amongst us who
is longing to arid a piece to the height of man and woman;
another of equal benevolence and power will, doubtless,
soon come over, who, for "a stamped directed envelope
will be as ready and able to take a piece off.
THE FALNT OF FASHION.
Suppose the Pope, or Lama Grand,
Lay comatose in bed,
And there was no one to command
His people in his stead,—
The faithful, then, in either case,
Would in a hole abide,
The like whereof is Woman's placo
In all the .world so wide.
In Paris, Fashion's High Priestesp,
Now prostrate in a swoon,
No longer dictates change of dress
At every change of moon.
Beleaguering German hosts enfold
Her Apostolic See •
It in abeyance you behold,
While senseless there lies she.
With peace, however, she '11 come to.
And then resume her reign.
Perhaps an era may ensue
Of vesture neat and plain.
Because it doth to reason stand,
Her sway if she resume,
Her nation's War Bill will demand
Retrenchment of costume.
The flighty and fantastic tire
Will probably subside,
CoDgruily must needs require
Head-gear to dress allied.
Preposterous top-knots may be cheap,
For all their bands and bows,
But will not in accordance keep
With reasonable clothes.
And high heels, likewise, will be put,
On that account, aloof.
And cease to give a damsel's foot
The semblance of a hoof.
Nature will undisfigured grace
From top to toe display;
The powder banished from the face:
The iouge-pot thrown away.
Who knows, indeed, France having been
In War severely schooled,
But that her garb will match her mien;
By sober taste be ruled P
Thar. Fashion will have grown demure,
Will cut all fal-lals down,
To bonnet black, from trimmings pure,
And Quaker shawl and gown P
"SPEAK UP!"
Me. Punch,
I reg to inform you that I went the other day
to see the Midsummer Nighfs Dream at the Queen's
Theatre, Lou? Acre. I also went to hear it. I heard it
only very partially. Some of the performers didn't speak
out. They were inaudible in the balcony; where I was.
I won't name names: for a hint is as good as a criticism to
any sensible young lady, whose lisp may be charming in
society, but is a bore on the stage. The Midsummer
Nighi's Dream is splendidly got up; the scenery is magni-
ficent, and the dresses are superb; but what is all that if.
in case you bad never read the play, you would, for all
you could hear, at times not know but that you were
listening, or rather trying to listen to a gorgeous bur-
lesque f I feel I have a right to ask this question, because
I did not go to criticise the performance with an eleemosy-
nary order, but went to see it, and paid my money, like
A Man.

BULL AND BULLOCK TO THE RESCUE.
(See the" Daily News" Advertisement.)
The Prussians may poke their fun at the National Society,
Denounce its doctors for " du mm he it," its nurses for impropriety;
Declare our quarter million given, for sick and wounded s aid,
Poor interest on the profit by Brummagem gunsmiths made,
On the sale of Sniders and Chassepots to French customers trans-
ported,
Whereby King William and Moltke have been disagreeably
thwarted.
But let Bismarck chafe, and Germany chide, and Bernstorff write
his full.
And neutrals sell arms, still Vaterland may be grateful to John Bull,
Who has Riven his cash and his skill and help to the sufferers by war
low laid,
And for German and French sick and wounded both good Samaritan
has played.
And if this Bull has been dutiful to humanity's holy laws.
There's a Bullock has shown him of the tame breed, in the same
sacred cause—
As Almoner of England's bounty to the hapless peasant crowd,
Whom ravage of war has left sad and sick and naked and famine-
cowed.
Then though Germany vie with France in gird and grumble at neutral
Bull,
Still Bull and Bullock, will join hands in a long, strong, and hearty
pull,
The one to find money, the other to spend it for the best,
That the hungry may have a stomachful, and the cold and naked be
drest.
The cry of France and Germany—" To arms!"
The cry of England—" To alms!"
A VOICE FROM THE WEIRD SISTEUS.
Th eke are eatable frogs and eatable snails; not the only eatable
vermin. The fruits of the earth are consumed by hares and rabbits, of
which creatures the former, roasted or jugged, and the latter, curried
or smothered in onions, may be satisfactorily consumed themselves,
especially by the farmers whose crops they devour. They may, there-
fore, be considered the natural quarry of the farmer as well as the fox,
and this is doubtless the sound and liberal view taken of them by the
nobleman who has set landlords the good example recorded by a con-
temporary in the subjoined announcement:—
"Lord Cawdor and Game-Pheservino.—The Earl op Cawdor has
made a material concession to his tenantry in regard to the ground game on
his estate. He has signified his intention of permitting the tenants to kill
and destroy all the rabbits on their farms."
Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
A Paradox.
A Poacher was fishing. No doubt
He'd catch a fine something, and cook it.
A keeper came walking about;
The poacher saw him—and a trout,
Which he lost, though he managed to hook it.
"they mat re housewives yet."
We may smile—the French men laughed—at the idea of a French
woman defending herself against irreverent Germans by the aid of a
thimble containing poison. But when we have smiled, let us own that
it is a good thing that the Amazonian mind should turn in the direc-
tion of thimbles. Needle and thread may follow.

GLYN UPON GLADSTONE.
he other evening
Mr. Glyn, the
Member for
Shaftesbury,
made an after-
dinner speech
thereat. The
Liberal "Whip"
spoke of the
Liberal Govern-
ment with libe-
rality, if not
quite extrava-
gance of praise.
He eulogised
MrCardwrll,
not, perhaps, ex-
cessively; and,
concerning our
Premier, he
delivered his
mind in the
words which
follow, with tlie
intervening ex-
clamations of
his audience:—
"In conclusion, he called upon them to join with him in his great feeling
of devotion and loyalty to the great man who headed tre Liberal party.
(' No, no,' and ' Hear, hear.') He believed that no honetter, and no abler,
and no more remarkable man, had lived since the days of Pitt,—(' OIO!
and ' Order')—-mi that in the present day they had nobody to be compared
with him. He thought the interests of England were safely confided to his
care. (' Not a bit of it.')"
It cannot be denied that, speaking as a fishmonger's man, the
Honourable Member did not at all cry " Unpleasant Fish!" On the
contrary, he may be said to have hollaed, as it were, "Here's your
finest fresh Mackerel!" as loud as he could. There is conceivable
ground for such a protest as " 0! O!" though " No! no!" may be
deemed too positively negative, and negation to an extent altogether
out of all bounds is certainly expressed in the cry, "Mot a bit of it."
To be sure, Mr. Gladstone might, in relation to the War, have
pursued a policy calculated to vindicate the proud position among the
nations of Europe which would be universally acknowledged to be, as
the saying is, suitable to the honour, dignity, importance, and prestige
of this great and glorious country. In consequence of that, most
likely, we should now be at war with either France or Germany, no
matter which, perhaps, in the estimation of the fine fellows who are
solicitous above all things for this great country's proud position.
If we were now fighting the French, or fighting the Germans, none
of us, not personally making fortunes by war, could be any the happier
for it than they are, except the gentlemen of the pavement .who bawl
for it, who would keep out of it, and would not have to pay for it.
Many would be the less happy; not a few would be miserable, with no
possible end to their misery but death. Suppose you had lost both
your hands in battle, for instance, of course you couldn't wash them,
nor your face neither. You could not help yourself at table, or any-
where else. Under all the discomfort to which you would be doomed
for life, what consolation would you derive from the thought that you
had been mutilated to maintain the proud position of this great
country P Had Mr. Gladstone not kept us at peace, many of Her
Majesty's subjects would have undergone mutilation, and a consider-
able, though limited, class of the community, not paying in person for
their country's proud position, would have to pay for it in purse.
They would be now execrating, instead of blessing, the Prime
Minister, because they would be anticipating the result of his glorious
policy in an enormous and inevitable addition to the Income-tax. On
the whole, most sane persons will be of opinion that the interests of
England are confided to Mr. Gladstone with some degree of safety,
insomuch that he who cries "Not a bit of it!" brays.

QUESTION AND ANSWER FOR THAMES COMMISSIONERS.
Wht are all arrangements for the improvement of the Thames of no
future value f Because they are all merely pro terns.
OUR CONTINENTAL SUPEBIOBS.
Mr. Punch,
We are fast getting disabused of our insular self-conceit.
Hitherto, Englishmen, or, to speak more heedfully, Britons, have been
accustomed to consider the other European nations, at least the chief
of them, essentially pretty much the same kind of people with them-
selves. Some little difference, to be sure, we recognised as existing
between us and foreigners; but we thought it was only some little.
We considered that we rather excelled them in point of rectitude, and,
accordingly, that, in our international dealings, we were somewhat
more particular than they in trying to do right. As a matter of fact,
of late years at least, we have been much more particular. The differ-
ence whereby we saw ourselves distinguished from oar neighbours,
we referred to a superiority, on our part, of moral faculties.
Late events, Sir, have taught us that we very grossly flattered our-
selves in taking credit for any the least superiority over our neighbours.
The difference between us and them, we now find to be very much
greater than we used to imagine; but to be a difference consisting in
our immense inferiority.
Every thinking man, Sir, must have been struck with consternation
when he was struck, the other day, with the enormous altitude of even
the French above us in military organisation and readiness for war,
not to name the altogether unspeakable height of the conquering
Germans.
Consideration of the French casus belli in regard to Germany on the
one hand, and the reasons for which Prussia invaded Denmark, and
annexed Hanover on the other, and consideration, further, of the
benediction which illustrious Personages have not dreaded to invoke for
the furtherance of schemes essentially identical with garotting whereby
the victim is killed, must also convince every man who thinks, that the
intellects which immeasurably surpass our own in forethought, as evi-
denced by their military precautions, differ widely from ours—differ, I
may say, Mo inferno—in their ideas of moral responsibility and the
consequences of setting it at naught, and deriding it. Hence, our eyes
may be opened to the perception that what we supposed to be a differ-
ence of morality in onr own favour, is, in fact, a difference of intelli-
gence in theirs. In short, they are infinitely cleverer than we are, and
they laugh at the thought of not daring to do anything which they
desire to do. and can.
The moral of all this, Mr. Punch, is, that we must try and render in-
vasion impossible by an army stronger than any which could be landed
on these shores, and by a navy able to destroy any fleet which could
attempt to convey it. That sort of moral comprises all the morality
which Continental sovereigns, statesmen, and peoples can teach us.
All other morality, indeed, they teach us to unlearn. We have already
unlearnt some. Our leading public instructors accustom us to regard
the idea of abstract good as fallacious. They habitually ridicule indig-
nation provoked by injustice or cruelty, under the sarcastic name of
"sentiment." Any regard for aught that is good beyond mere mate-
rial good they term " sentimental. Opposition to the destruction of
forests, for instance, and the enclosure of commons, in so far as it arises
from a love of landscapes, and a sense of beauty, is, in their language,
absurdly sentimental; and so, indeed, are all those feelings, except
pride and vanity, which distinguish men from pigs. Horror and hatred
of war, as barbarous, are sentimental in the most despicable degree.
Consider, Sir, the sort of photographs that were lately to be seen in
many of our principal picture-shop windows. You remember the time
when any man would have been cut if he had been found with such
things in his possession. This is just one indication that we are at
least rising to a level with that intellectual elevation whence neighbour-
ing nations look down upon us, and those insular hallucinations which
make most of us believe, more or less firmly, in the existence of chimsras,
which we name moral principles and laws. There is one belief at any
rate, Mr. Punch, which we must discard at. once; belief in human
nature as represented by foreign Ministers, Diplomatists, and pro-
jectors of secret treaties, and by all those whom they serve, or govern,
or govern and serve too. We must bar our shores, so to speak,
against invasion as we bar our doors and windows. We cannot, and
must not, trust any foreigners farther than we could throw a bull by
the tail. Europe is rising in the scale of civilisation at a hopeful rate.
Shall England rise likewise, singing, by poetical license,
Excelsior!
Mrs. Ramsbotham.
Mrs. Ramsrotham writes to say she is preparing for Christmas
time. Her young friends are learning to dance the Mignonette, she
says, and are learning their parts in order to play some Cheroots in
the drawing-room.

receipt for that dish—4bt de cheval, and tendrons de thorough-bred
a la La Grange, London, if she were wise, would willingly submit to a
siege as long as that of Troy, with Old Hoss a a nalurel for prize
instead of Helen.
The "harmless, necessary cat" is another domestic animal whose
culinary capabilities seem to be rising into due appreciation under
siege. Tbe lively Daily News Correspondent inside Paris, though
usually of rather a cynical turn, grows absolutely enthusiastic over
the meat of Toms and Tabbies, which he describes as
"Something between rabbit and squirrel, with a flavour all its own. It is
delicious. I recommend those who have cats with philoprogenitive proclivi-
ties, instead of drowning the kittens, to eat them. Either smothered in
onions, or in a ragout, they are capital eating. When I return to London, I
shall frequently treat myself to one of these domestic animals, and ever feel
grateful to Bismarck for having taught me that cat served op for dinner is
the right animal in the right place."
Again, donkey we are at once gratified and surprised to learn, is
nothing short of delicious. So let us sing henceforth:—
"If I had donkey wot wouldn't go,
Do you think I'd waste him P O no, no!
I'd kill, cook, and eat him, and cry, 0 no:
Nought like Donkey 1"
Kitchen Dressers.—Fine Cooks.
THE CAUSALITY OF PERSUASION.
The subjoined extract from the Pall Mall is surely a nut for the
Tablet:—
"At a Bible Society meeting at Manchester last week, the Rev. Donald
Frazer, who represented the parent association, said that the Emperor
Napoleon 'while he sat upon the throne of France was certainly a most
cordial friend to all the agents of the Society. In the most remarkable way,
and for whatever reason, he facilitated their movements throughout France,
protected them from small persecutions, and never shut his ears against
them.'"
After having long befriended the Bible Society, perhaps the Romanist
press will point out, Louis Napoleon had to surrender at Sedan.
The subsequence of the latter fact to the former, is certainly not less
remarkable than that of his downfal to his evacuation of Rome.
A Good Beginning.
The Lectures, at the Kensington Museum, for Women are about to
recommence; one of the first courses being, On the Clavecin and the
Pianoforte," (illustrated by performances on the latter instrument) by
Mr. Ernst Pauer. The authorities at Kensington are evidently in
earnest in their desire to provide instruction for ladies, and we antici-
pate that a large number will be found ready to appreciate the "Power
of Sound."
Thought in November.
(By a Londoner.)
Perhaps England's best defence against invasion will always be her
Fogs. No foreigner would like such a climate.
Thought ry a Railway Director.—Bhitansia used to rule the
waves. She now rules the land—with lines.

WOMEN, BEWARE WOMEN*"
omfoktarlt, as everybody knows,
no husband can give a plain answer
to the question, "Have you left
off beating your wife yet f" But
if the inquiry were made of Mr.
Punch, "Do you often strike a
female P" he would (after con-
sideration) reply that such is not
his frequent practice. "The man
who would lay his hand upon a
woman except—she richly de-
served it" (to adopt the improved
reading of the Irish actor, fined
one morning for correcting his
wife, who played with him that
night in the Honeymoon) is a
quotation that springs to Mr.
Punch's indignant lips.
But there be exceptions to all rules. "In a case of necessity, let
women die," says the kindly but rough soldier in Antony and Cleopatrr.
They must be beaten at times. But the chivalrous way of managing
the punishment is to let them beat themselves. Mr. Punch proposes to
oblige a Lady Correspondent, by permitting her to perform Happy
Dispatch" upon herself. She has sent him a long, eloquent, and
excited letter, bitterly complaining that he is not favourable to Strong
Minded Women, that he suggests feminine work to them, and that
when he depicts them, he makes them ugly. He likes this last touch—
it is womanly. Barry Cornwall struck the right note when he wrote
that an unhappy girl once had "gentleness, vanity, maiden shame."
If the Strong Minded one cares whether her nose is red or blue, or how
her bonnet looks, she is not all Strong Minded, and Mr. Punch takes
her to his fatherly heart. But his present Correspondent, desirous that
amends should be made to the ladies whom she champions eo ably in
prose, has written some poetry, for their further championship, and this
she defies Mr. Punch to print. He picks up the gauntlet, very likely a
pretty glove (5J), and he prints the verses, without venturing to revise
the composition so as to bring it within conventional rules. If the
ladies mentioned are not grateful for what their defender has done, Mr.
Punch cannot help that. He may mention, however, that there are
some names which he holds in the highest honour, and those owners he
should have described as Right Minded rather than Strong Minded.

THE PHILOSOPHY OF HUNGER.
An official telegram from Versailles in the Times the other day an-
nounced that:—
"Fifty-three eagles and standards were surrendered at Metz."
Bazaine and his brave but unfortunate army were doubtless sorry
at having to surrender their eagles. Yet experience must have taught
the famishing garrison of Metz that fifty-three or more Imperial eagles
are not intrinsically worth one genuine goose.
BETTING-CLUB LAW.
On Tuesday last week, at Bow Street, a large number of cads were
placed at the bar before Mr. Vaughan on a charge of using a'
house at Brompton. called "The Knightsbridge Exchange Company
(Limited)" as an unlawful betting-house.
The cads were ably defended by Mr. Serjrant Ballantinr on the
ground that there was really no difference between their betting-house
and Tatter?all's.
Mr. Vaughan adjudged the keeper of "The Knightsbridge Ex-
change Company (Limited)" to a fine of £100, full penalty. On the
book-makers and list-keepers of that betting-house he imposed fines of
£20 in two cases, and of £10 in six. In giving judgment his Worship
thus remarked on the mainstay of the learned Serjeant's defence:—
"He (Mr. Yauqhan) could give no opinion with reference to Tattersall's.
He knew nothing about it, and even if he did he could make no judicial use
of auoh knowledge. It appeared that the Knightsbridge Exchange was an
association of persons who had formed themselves into a club for the purpose
of carrying on these transactions, in their judgment with some greater security
than if they had allowed the general public to go into the yard."
It must appear to everybody who knows the nature of Tattersall's
that the only differences between the Knightsbridge Exchange and that
club, are that the former is a dearer club than the latter, and frequented
by persons better dressed than its members, and some of them better
off; a certain number, solvent or insolvent, being persons of rank and
title. Either place, in a sense, may be said to be equally the resort of
the better classes, and possibly a Magistrate might, on occasion, decide,
and judges might affirm the decision, that one was no worse than the
other.
The Jockey Club must, therefore, see the urgent necessity which has
arisen for pressing Mr. Gladstone to lose no time in convoking Par-
liament for a short Session, in order that it may forthwith pass an Act
for the protection of an institution whose legalised existence is neces-
sary for the bettermost of the better orders, since without it they
would labour under serious difficulty in the pursuit of the main object
of their useful lives. Clearly there ought to be one law for the noble-
men and gentlemen of the turf, and another for the cads; but at
present it is gravely to be apprehended that there is not.
A PROFESSIONAL PRINCE.
Nothing can be handsomer than the Stained Window just inserted
into Guildhall, but it was not the happiest thought to erect a stained
window as a Memorial of the unstained character of the late Prince
Consort.
Referring to certain difficulties in the working of the Ambulance
Corps at Versailles, the renowned Special Correspondent of the Times
says:—
"The Prince op Tour and Taxis, of the Order of St. George, presents
another difficulty—not willingly—for he is one of the most amiable and kindly
of men, and, dressed in simple civil garb, is for ever looking about the
hospitals."
Surgeons, in hospital practice especially, often have occasion, when
using a particular instrument, to give it a twirl named tour de maitre,
and, in another kind of case, they always, if they can, effect a return of
displaced organs by a manipulation called taxis. Can the Prince of
Tour and Taxis, who is for ever looking about hospitals, be an illus
trious Surgeon on whom the titles of those two provinces of his pro
fession have been conferred by an enlightened Sovereign, who has
known how to appreciate distinguished eminence in a truly noble
science f We, indeed, have a St, George's Hospital, and also a St.
Bartholomew's, but no Peer even, much less a Prince of the Order of
either one Saint or the other.
Our Social Defences.
The revival of the Stocks is a proceeding of which the legality has
lately come into question. Of its expediency there can be no doubt in
the mind of anyone who knows how many small shopkeepers are
constantly fined for using false weights and measures, and how very
many more both cheat so, and also adulterate their wares with im-
punity. For the correction of those offenders the Stocks might be
revived most advantageously; and the multitude of the rogues who
would have to sit in them would, in Southwark, Lambeth, and some
other districts, require the arrangement of the Stocks in a kind of
stockade.
Racing Obstructives).
It is remarkable, and has been remarked, that the faces of the
sporting gentlemen of the pavement, who create obstructions thereon
in front of the turfy news-office windows are, for the most part, dirty.
These gentlemen and their like, and not the working-classes, constitute
the order properly and distinctly describable as the Great Unwashed."
It is not toil that their visages are begrimed by, and, in spite of appear-
ances, few, probably, of the sweeps they may have among them, bear
any useful relation to chimneys.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSAYS.
II.—LORD MAYORS.
11 The Lord Mayor knocks. "Welcome."—Richard III.
Whin Julius Cssar laid the first stone of the City of London on
a Saturday half-holiday, he expatiated in his speech at the banquet
which followed the ceremony, on the blessings to arise to civilisation,
commerce, and cookery, from the office of Lord Mayor, then recently
instituted by his predecessors, and predicted in glowing colours, amidst
the cheers of a sympathising audience. careers of epicurean happiness
and prosperity for those who should be elected by the Livery to wear
the robe and polish the chain of London's Supreme Magistrate; inti-
mating at the same time hit intention to leave sufficient funded property
to supply a copy of his Commentaries, handsomely bound, and contain-
ing an appropriate inscription, to each successive occupant of the
Mansion House.
Many years have elapsed since that memorable day, and of all those
who were present none survive except the venerable twin brothers,
Gog and Magog; but the anticipations of Julius have been rather
more than verified by experience, and gratitude has embalmed, in the
appellation of one of the most beautiful of the many beautiful suburbs
of the Metropolis, and in the title of not the least meritorious of those
social institutions which are the pride, and boast, and striking feature
of the nineteenth century, the names of two, at least, of London's
Lord Mayors, who have shed brilliancy and lustre on the curule chair,
and raised it to the highest pinnacle of lofty distinction.
To these illustrious examples tradition has added numerous well-
authenticated instances of poor boys who travelled to London from
Yorkshire on foot, arrived at their journey's end with a florin in their
pocket, began life by putting up the shutters of a smalt shop in the
Poultry, and ended it by taking down the Blood Royal to dinner in
the Guildhall, and amassed, during a long and honourable career, prin-
cipally devoted to drysaltery, as much money as would have paved one
of the streets of London (particularly one of the very narrow ones)
with that gold which was the glittering bait that drew the enthusiastic
youth to seek his fortune and ruin his digestion in the marts of wealth
and commerce, and at City feasts and civic banquets, in the capital of
England and Wales.
Little did he dream in his father's humble home of the splendid
destiny in store for him in meridian life—of the state coach (panels
painted by Cipriani) and the state barge; of princes, and peers, and
plenipotentiaries as his guests, and Mr. Hark eh as his toastmaster;
of the mace and the sword, the loving cup and the astonishing furry
cap; of the pale moonlight of knighthood, and the broad sunshine
of a baronetcy; of such honoured names as Staples, and Birch, and
Ring and Brymer; of Recorders and Ale-conners, Common Ser-
geants and Bridgemasters, Secondaries and Water Bailiffs, Remem-
brancers and men in armour; of escorts of Life Guards and parties of
glee-singers; of swan-hoppiugs and Epping hunts; of presentations
to the Lord Chancellor, and all the other delicacies of the season.
Yet these and many more blessings, too numerous to particularise
even in the smallest type, have fallen in the lap of the plodding, the
persevering, the painstaking—of him who when first he saw "the
light of London flaring like a dreary dawn" hardly knew how to
meet the expenses of a night's lodging for his weary limbs, but wrote
a capital hand, and was quick at accounts.
No year passes without the newspapers appropriating a paragraph
to the performance, by the Sheriffs of London, of the stimulating
ceremony of "chopping a number of faggots and counting six horse-
shoes and sixty-one nails" in the tranquillity of the Court of Ex-
chequer; but it has hitherto escaped notice that there is a still more
ancient obligation, which compels the Lord Mayor, on the eve of the
Ninth of November, to leave his home, (carefully closing the front door
behind him.) and walk three times down Ludgate Hill, until the clock
of St. Paul's tolls the hour of midnight, when, after counting the
strokes, he shuts up his umbrella, and runs at a good round pace in
the opposite direction.
Both the archives of the Corporation and the publications of the day
are obstinately silent on this head, but on the other hand, they revel
in interesting details as to the remarkable privileges which are the
Lord Mayor's perquisites. For instance, the ratepayers are bound
under heavy penalties to find him a new set of teeth if he requires
them during his term of office; he is entitled to the first bushel of
sprats which come into the market after the fashionable season has
commenced; whenever Royalty passes under Temple Bar he can claim
a white hat from the Crown; he has all the patent medicines at a
great reduction; his footmen are exempt from serving in the Coast-
guard; he is patron, ex officio, of the Society for the Relief of Cooks in
Distress; he has a free admission for himself and his family to Madame
Tussaud's exhibition; and the Lady Mayoress is allowed to gather
the flowers in Victoria Park without any interference on the part of
the police.
There are other Lord Mayors, of Dublin and York, but as the
local historians, although they have been out in all weathers, have failed
to identify them with the Proconsuls under the Empire, they do not
come within the range of this disquisition.

NEW POSTAGE STAMP FOR FRANCE.
ery significant is the ques-
tion thus raised by a Corre-
spondent of the Times.—
"It is officially announced
that postage-stampa with the
effigy of the Republic will not
be put into circulation until
those bequeathed by the Em-
pire, of which it appears there
is a large stock on hand, shall
have been used up. When
Napoleon's familiar features
shall disappear from our
letters, who can tell what
there may be in readineas to
replace them? Nous en aeons
t'u tant d'autres."
France has" tried almost
every conceivable form of
Government. But there are
two forms which she has
not yet tried. One of these
is a Triumvirate. What if
the head of Napoleon on
the French postage-stamps
shall be replaced by a triple-
headed monster formed of
the Count de Chakrord,
an Orleans Prince, and, say
M. Rochefort; imaging the fusion, in their persons, of Absolute
Monarchy, Constitutional ditto, and the Republic P
But there is yet another form of Government which France has never
yet tried upon herself, though, for the last twenty-one years until the
other day, she npheld its trial on a neighbour.
Archrishop Manning has just exercised his "Liberty of Prophe-
sying" by the publication of a Minute relative to the situation at
Rome, wherein he thus testifies:—
"Let no one imagine that the temporal power of Pius the Ninth is over
because a King has invaded Rome and spoiled the Pontiff of his rights. • • •
Home will see many changes yet; but there is one which will never change—
the See of St. Peter and the voice of the Vicar of Christ."
As regards the future. Dr. Manning may be a true seer; but the
firesent he does not seem to see exactly as it is. He apparently sees
ess than the truth. Perhaps he does not see what he does not wish to
see. He sees indeed, and says, that "a King has invaded Rome."
But he does not see that the King whom he means is a King at the
beck as well as head of a people, and that the people and King, in-
vading Rome, are welcomed by the Romans, who have voted that they
will .have the King of Italy, and not the Pope King, to reign over
them.
In thus voting, however, Dr. Manning may consider that the
Romans were simply infatuated; and they must, indeed, be deemed
mad by everybody who, believing the Pope really endowed with the
celestial Viceroyalty which he claims, of course believes his temporal
kingdom to have been a heaven upon earth. The Pope's late subjects
cannot but appear raving mad to the Pope's Eldest Daughter.
As regards the future, Dr. Manning's language is obscure; his
vision'may be hazy. But what he seems to predict is that Rome will
never cease to be the See of St. Peter. A great controvertist, however,
on the side of Dr. Manning, namely Bishop Milner, correcting what
he considers a misapprehension, declares it to be the opinion of some of
the most learned Romanist commentators "that before the end of the
world Rome will relapse into its former Paganism." If Dr. Manning
thinks that this may be, and yet the See of St. Peter remain unchanged,
then, so far, prophets and prophetic doctors do not differ. The Pope
will carry the See wheresoever he goes. Couldn't he carry it to Paris P
France has yet to try a Theocracy. Now, for a Theocracy, there is the
Pope disengaged, and, according to her own faith, as well as his own
assertion, the very man. What could be more natural than for the
Holy Father to throw himself into the arms of his Eldest Daughter P
Let both the French Constituent Assembly, when convoked, and his
Holiness, consider this suggestion. That is to say unless the successor
of St. Peter can make up his mind to be content with a peculiar tele-
graphic wire and a private post-bag, and bring himself to agree with
the King op Italy upon a modus vivendi other than the life of cat and
dog. Or else, the Triple Hat, with the Pope's head in it, and the
Cross Keys under it, might replace Napoleon's effigy on "the French
postage-stamp.

A Hint to the G.P.O.
There is a good custom established of publishing a weekly return of
telegrams, showing (generally) a progressive increase in the number
dispatched. An equally good custom would be to give a return of the
time they occupy in Transmission, showing (perhaps generally, too)
the increase, as compared with the old system.
JUST VENGEANCE.
This is from the Daily News. The Correspondent at Metz writes :—
"I was much amused by an item in last night's orders from Phince
Frederick Charles's head-quarters. It was to the effect that, whereas an
unprincipled rascal of a Hamburgh cigar merchant had been selling boxes of
cigars to the troops, the upper tier of which consisted of good weeds, while the
lower ones were unmitigated trash, the military authorities of any place where
this astute gentleman should present himself, were enjoined to lay hold of
him, and transmit him to Prince Frederick Charles's head-quarters at
Corny."
Surely, the most vehement anti-German (if he be a smoker) must
admire the Prince for this noble action. It is a brave "protest
against Shams." Such outrages as that of the Hamburgh cigar mer-
chant are everyday committed in England, but we, alas, have no means
of serving the sinners out. We hope the fellow will be caught, and
that his epitaph will state his crime for the edification of all other
wicked tobacconists in the world.

of the Aurora the last week, its probable causes and effects—luminous

Boreallus'. His Aurora is quite of a different description—blue eyes
and brown hair, with small hands and feet, and an income of her own.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CIGARETTE PAPERS-
PAPER II.—MY AUNTS GREAT POLICE CASE.—Continued.
I told her that being "summoned" only meant that she was to
attend at a police-court.
"Good gracious!" exclaimed ray Aunt; "and be in the papers next
day, with only my Christian name, and nothing before it! Besides,"
she added, as if seeing it in a totally new light, "one doesn't know
what sort of account they '11 give of it."
I informed her that there were twenty or thirty ordinary summons
cases occurring every day which were never reported.
I don't think she liked this mode of summarily dismissing a matter
of all-absorbing interest.
"Which am I," she asked, "the Prosecutor or the—the—what is
it P—Prisoner P"
"No, not exactly Prisoner," I said. "She was," I explained, put-
ting it as palatably as possible, "the Defendant."
This seemed to alter her opinion of the importance of the summons,
as her next question was, "1 suppose I must attend at the Court P"
It appeared that she had some idea of being represented by her
maid. This, I informed her, was impossible.
"Perhaps, then, I'd better have a Barrister." I foresaw that she
had in view, as usual, the interest for her hundred pounds paid to my
legal tutor, the Conveyancer, and was firmly determined to resist any
such proposal as that of my going into Court on her account.
"Barristers, my dear Aunt, are not required in such a case as this."
"But," she argues, evidently considering my information as merely
given evasively and for a selfisD consideration, "but some nice points
of law might arise, you know; and then if I wasn't prepared, you
know, the Cabman might win, merely on a quibble. Such things do
happen, my dear," she added seriously, seeing me smile. "I'm sure
yon read of them every day in the papers, and goodness knows I don't
want to argue the case myself, and perhaps be carried up to higher
Courts, and go over it all again before a Lord Chancellor, merely for
the sake of thirty shillings, for that's what he claims."
I assured her that her fears were perfectly groundless.
"Indeed!" she exclaimed, triumphantly. "Then why do we read
of Mr. Somebody, the Magistrate, reserving a point, and sending it up
to a higher Court P"
I began an explanation of "why the Magistrate "—but, failing to
make it intelligible, in consequence, I admit, of not myself distinctly
knowing why he did anything of the sort, I fell back upon my old
position, that this was one of those cases in which no point of law was
likely to be raised.
My Aunt could not see this. This police case had given a new
impetus to her placid existence, and she was so bitten with a sort of
Law fever, that, had there been a chance offered her, she would, I be-
lieve, have then and there gone down to the first Police Court,
and requested to be heard, ex parte, on the merits of her own personal
and private view of the case.
"Ladies do conduct their own cases," she observed, with dignity,
"because I know there's a Miss Somebody who's always coming up,
over and over again, and speaking for years in the Mouse of Lords;
but I think," my Aunt added more to herself than to me, "that at the
end of every four days she's generally put out of Court by the
Usher."
This reminiscence came opportunely, as my Aunt had no fancy for
figuring in such a scene as being " put out of Court" represented to
her mind. Struggling with the Usher, and hitting him over the head
with a blue bag full of legal papers and red tape was the least that
could be done (90 she evidently thought) in defence of her right, in the
event of such an "ungentlemanly order being made by the Lord
Chancellor."
"It comes off," she informed me, "to-morrow: and I'm to be there
about twelve. Talking of 'twelve,' I suppose." she said, as if rather
proud of her leeal knowledge, "that I shall be able to object to the
jury if I don't like them P"
Once more she was disappointed at hearing from me that at a Police
Court there was no jury. She had always thought that all trials were
by jury. After a silence, during which she was considering this extra-
ordinary defect in the British Constitution, she startled me by exclaim-
ing, suddenly,—
"And no wigs P"
My shaking my head depressed her immensely: it brought home to
her the fact of "no wigs in the liveliest manner. She was getting
more and more astonished at every revelation concerning the adminis-
tration of justice.
"But,"—she asked, in a tone of remonstrance, as much as to say,
"Come, this won't do, you know; I can't reallv believe you if you
deny this "—" surely the Magistrate wears a wig P"
1 really wished he did, for her sake. She looked so utterly aghast on
my replying, "No, Aunt, he doesn't. No one wears a wig."
"No oneP"
"No one."
"It's very extraordinary," she remarked, in a musing tone, after a
pause; "I always till now thought they wore wigs. I fancy I've seen
pictures of them in wigs."
Not finding me in a humour to question this effort of her imagina-
tion, she looked at her watch, and reminding me that I had to come
and fetch her punctually at eleven (" so as to be in time, for one may
have to push through a tremendous crush, and I hate a crowd," she
said), she walked down the garden, with the step of an early martyr
going to the stake in the cause of Truth; and shaking my hand
solemnly (still in the same sort of character as some historical person-
age bidding some other historical personage farewell the night before
the execution) she entered her fly (driver quite sober this time), and
drove off in it, viewing it, probably, as a sort of triumph, and herself
as an aristocratic Marie Antoinette driven to her doom at the
instanoe of a Revolutionary Cabman.

SONG OF A SOLEMNITY.
November 9, 1870.
The century was tending to its olose,
Had reached man's age appointed, so to say,
Out of his bed when Father Thames arose,
Upon November's ninth returning day.
Above the wave he reared his placid head,
Heard, thereupon, the British Public roar,
And turning, saw a brave procession tread
The New Embankment on his Northern shore.'
"Good speed, Lord Mayor," then cried the River' King,
"My Lord Mayor Dakin, to thy train and thee;
Of all the pageants which this day doth bring
Yours will have been the first to pass yon Quay.";
"Ha! Father Thames," the grand Lord Mayor replied,
"The fact you note Posterity will con
In History's page." Thames sank into his tide";
And in his glory the Lord Mayor went on.
A CARD ON POST-CARDS.
Authorities of the Post-Office, mind what you were told at the
Mansion House, by the late Lord Mayor. The advantage of the
New Post-Cards, mark you, is open to be, and is in fact, abused
by evil-disposed persons. An Act of Parliament empowers the Post-
master-General, from time to time, with the approval of the Treasury,
to make arrangements for the prevention of this abuse, by not for-
warding any cards, or other missives of an objectionable kind. Just
see, all of you who are in a position to see, that this Act is acted on.
Nothing can be easier in most cases; but there is one way in which a
Post-Card may be misused, so as to elude your vigilance. Accustomed
to read only respectable newspapers, perhaps you are unfamiliar with
the names of Advertising Quacks. You will find them in provincial
journals commonly, and in the baser part of the London Press. All
Post-Cards used by Quacks to distribute their Advertisements are
grossly abused. All such, my Lord Postmaster-General, do you, by
the authority which the Legislature has committed to you, direct your
subordinates in the sorting department to detain. Respect this.
BOCIAL SCIENCE IN PRUSSIA.
They manage things better, to some extent, at Konigsberg than they
do in places elsewhere; for instance, perhaps, in a metropolis where the
Government allows the Roughs to hold menacing demonstrations.
According to a recent telegram from the better-managed city :—
"A royal order has been issued, releasing Herr Jacort, Herr Hareiq,
and six other persona who are confined in Loetzen. The Socialist Democrats
are, however, to remain in prison."
The release of Dr. Jacort and his companions in quod for free
expression of fair opinion, was the correction of a blunder; but there
can be no mistake about the detention of Socialist Democrats. In a
branch, at least, of Social Science, Bismarck and his King are evi-
dently much farther advanced than the British Association.
The Headless Girl.
The Young Lady, who, on hearing of a rival's excellent match,
hid her head in the sofa cushions, has, since then, entirely lost it.
But she is entirely unconscious of the fact,, and her friends don't
notice it.

LADY-LATIN.
The Ladies besiege Mr. Punch with supplications for his inter-

new rule seems to have inflicted great annoyance upon those whom
Lord Hartington would be very sorry to disoblige. But no repre-
sentation that has been sent to Mr. Punch equals in eloquence one that
has been made by a Norfolk lady through the columns of our friend
the Standard. She says:—
"I doubt if a single individual could be found in Her Majesty's realms
who would not express thanks and delight over and over again at onoe more
seeing restored to us the former parcel postage rate, which was really in many
instances almost the very vade mecum of one's existence."

of £750,000 sterling bonds, for the construction of the Glencoe line of
146 miles (the' Canada Air Line Railway'), having twenty years to
run," &c. This is a project which only wants airing to succeed, and
we hope no cloud of suspicion will ever rest upon it.

PANIC IN THE MARRIAGE MARKET.

r. Punch,
Allow me to
direct your atten-
tion to the remark-
able fact that of tale
the Marriages an-
nounced in the Times
have been very far
exceeded in number
by the Deaths, of
which the Births,
also, have fallen con-
siderably short. On
one particular day
last week the addi-
esticex-
25, the
to the
penae
depart
happy hunting-
grounds as many as
39, and the sacri-
fices on the altar of
Hymen no more nu-
merous than 13.
Sir, allow me to
congratulate the
country on the de-
creasing marriage-
rate which these
figures indicate. The speedy consequence of it will of course be a corresponding
reduction of the birth-rate. Thus, the increase of population will be cheeked,
and perhaps our numbers will happily be brought to a stand-still. A stop will
thus be put to the spread of towns, and the consequent destruction, and dis-
figurement with bricks and mortar, of the country's beauty.
Let me, also, congratulate the excellent Recorder of London, and Member of
Parliament for Southampton, Mr. Russell Gurney. I have not in my own mind
the slightest doubt that, for tbe diminution in the number of marriages now
evidently going on, the lovers of old English scenery and old English mansions,
which we may hope the stoppage of numerical progress will save, are indebted to
that honourable and learned gentleman's Married Women's Property Bill. 1 have
the honour to be, Mr. Punch, your ancient Dhuid.
P.S. Those mean fellows who would have married for money bnt for the Wives'
Property Bill, now, many of them, do not marry at all. There are, therefore,
no mercenary marriages. Men can't marry for money, and women, we know,
never do. Children generally turn after their parents. Our population, whilst
growing leas numerous, will grow more select.
CANUTE AND DAKIN.
The sea-waves, O my son—and daughter—
They regard not royal boots.
On the beach of Southampton Water,
They advanced upon King Canute's.
And the tide that is no man's waiter,

Would have splashed his feet too; that greater

Fogs, too, men can make remember
That they no man's will obey.
Now and then, in obscure November,
They bedim e'en the Lord Mayor's day I
And this year will live in story,
By the fog in London's air,
For a time which did veil the glory
And the Show of the Great Lord Mayor!
But it smothered not all his splendour
With its dusky pall of woe.
E'en the fog showed itself to render
Some respect to the Lord Mayor's Show;
As a true London fog appearing
To revere that City's Chair:
For it lifted anon, and clearing,
Did give way to the Grand Lord Mayor!

NOVEMBEB THE NINTH.
Although conscious that the Eyes of Europe were not, owing to
recent events, so much fixed upon them as usual, the Cities and
Boroughs of England and Wales did not allow this consideration to
interfere with the call of duty, but in fulfilment of the requirements
of the Act of Parliament (10 Hen. VIII. Cap. 30, sec. 13) proceeded,
last week, to choose their Mayors with the customary formalities,
speeches, bell-ringing, loving cups, and paragraphs in the local prints.
A few facts relating to these elections may not be without interest at
the present juncture of affairs.
Darlington (a place which is a universal favourite) as all corporate
towns should, has very wisely secured a K itching—Darlington means
to have feasts. Falmouth rather upsets our traditions in choosing a
Mayor who is Lran, but Ipswich sticks to one who is strong as
Sampson. Leeds has grown aristocratic, and will have nothing less
than a Bareon, leaving it to such a.parvenu as Middlesborough to seek
amusement in a chief Magistrate who is Racey. At Cambridge the
choice was made out of Peek, and at Newbury there is a Ryott
already. Lancaster is lucky to have a Guide in Bradshaw; the
inhabitants of Poole may be certain that Harker will listen to all
their reasonable complaints, and make an admirable toast-master as
well; and as these are serious times, Manchester will be none the
worse for again having a Mayor who is Grave.
The day may come when there will be Mayoresses, even with more
power than they now possess: meanwhile Hartlepool accepts Chris-
tian Neilson as the nearest approach to Christine Nilsson.
Coventry and Northampton may be bracketed, for no particular reason
except that Berry rhymes to Perry. Devonport and Oldham seem
to have identical proclivities, the difference between May and Mayall
being but verbal—(we are glad this distinction has been conferred on
the photographic art)—like Lee and Leeman at Wakefield and York
U Maidstone a Pine flourished; this is the second year of the
Thorne blooming at Barnstaple, but the first appearance of a Nutt
in the romantic seclusion of Droitwich. Canning, and Hyde, and
Thurlow, and Spencer, and Livingstone, are great names—so
Bristol, and Sialeybridge, and Ryde, and Preston, and Liverpool, seem
very properly to think.
Wales is staunch to its patron Saint, so Cardiff seeks the protec-
tion of David: at two other towns in the Principality there will be
gay doings this winter, when the Mayors of Oswestry and Welshpool
give a ball, or, to speak more correctly, a MoRRis-dance.
Lastly, we are sure there will be a feeling of universal satisfaction
at the aunouncement that those old and tried servants of the public,
Brown, Jones, Smith, and Rorinson are all in office this year.
ARMIES IN THE AIR.
Every day's telegrams bring some fresh wonder. From the Royal
Head-Quarters at .Versailles, the other day, came a message stating
that—
"Two balloons, with five passengers,
hussars, and brought to Versailles."
have been captured by Prussian
Were the hussars who captured those aerial vehicles a flying
squadronP Anyhow, we may expect soon to see armies whose right
and left wings will enable them to fly aloft.
Victors and Vanquished.
Denmark was invaded and despoiled. Danes were slaughtered by
their invaders. These, in their turn, have been invaded likewise; and,
though victorious, many of them slaughtered too. Might we not call
the authors of these slaughters, respectively, Muller and Tropmann P
No; for the very reason that their names are not those. The differ-
ence between them and the above-named inmates of Madame
Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors is nominal.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

POETRY AND PUFFERY.
rusty Mr. Punch,—As
a person of consummate
sense you will probably
agree with me that
something must be done
to check the nuisance
of shop circulars. The
system is getting in-
tolerable. Men who
have the boldness to
advertise by circular
will venture to the
highest altitude of inso-
lence. Under cover of
an envelope, stamped
with the royal arms, or
emblazoned with the
crest of some exalted
and coroneted person-
age, they beguile you
into reading an adver-
tisement of places where
coals may be bought
cheap, or an annoance-
ment of a sham sale
under some pretended
bankruptcy, where silks
and satins may be pur-
chased for the price of yarns and cottons. Worse than this, they
inundate your letter-box with packs of postal cards, which your servants
will be sure to grin at when they hand, them to you, offering the best
of prices for your left-off coats and waistcoats, or your wife's last
season's chignon.
Another nuisance of trade circulars is'that when you areaway from
home, you have to pay the postage of their being forwarded. Give as
stringent and explicit orders as you please against their being sent to
you, your servants will declare that they cannot tell a circular from a
private letter; and so, unless you are prepared to live as though you
were in Paris, with your correspondence 9topped, you must pay the
postal piper to a very pretty tune for forwarding; your circulars.
Perhaps a tax on circulars might lessen their abundance, and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer would have my warmest thanks if he
would venture to impose one. But there would be a hideous clamour
about shackling free trade, and of fettering the energies of free-
born British shopkeepers. As a measure of some slight relief, 1
would, however, humbly hint that trade puffs, if not in poetry, should
be charged quadruple postage. This, in some degree, might stimulate
the brains of their composers, and so promote the interests of com-
mercial English literature. To show what sort of quatrains might to
this end be concocted, 1 would submit the patterns following to our
commercial poets:—
For a Shoemaker.
Do your boots wear down at heel P
Do your corns e'er make you squeal P
Then be advised, my friend, and go,
Your Bluchers buy of Snooks & Co.
For a Glover.
Your bets on the Derby 70U wish to be paid:
May I hint where the best gloves in London are made P
Bid your betters to Kiddy and Dogskin repair,
And mind you have those at five shillings a pair.
For a Carriage Builder.
O, if I had some one to love me,
To Wheeler and Pole we'd repair:
Into no other carriages shove me,
For the best of all builders they air!
For a Pastry-Cook.
Sweet lady, when you 're asked to marry,
Pray do not for one moment tarry,
But fly to Spice and Son, who make
The very richest wedding-cake.
For a Batter.
Gents who would sport a nobby tile,
First chop for bang-up swellish style,
Such as are worn by Royal Dukes,
Should go to Noses, near St. Luke's.
For a Vermin-Killer.
Yes, love in a cottage is all very nice,
But black-beetles there often abound;
Purchase Crunch's " Destroyer," and then in a trice,
Of your beetles not one will be found.
For a Hag and Bone Merchant.
Fair maiden, say, hast thou a mother P
A doting father P sister P brother P
Then tell them, please, that Brown and Jones,
Pay the best price for rags and bones.
For a Cheap Clothier.
My Pal, when you the question pop,
Purchase your togs at Shoddy's shop:
Such slap-up vests as he'll supply,
Are sure to charm the female eye.
Fondly trusting my suggestion m»y afford some mitigation of the
nuisance of trade circulars, I sign myself, yours hopefully,
Tennyson Topper Thompson Smith.
Pariuusui Place, Friday.
MUSCULAR MUSIC.
ecehtly, among other novel-
ties, we noticed an ann ounce-
tuent of a Musical Gymna-
sium for Ladies. Now, we
have often had the misery of
attending the performance
of musical gymnastics, and
our mind shudders at the
thought of the tortures we
might suffer if we let our
wife and daughters go
through a course of train-
ing at a Musical Gymna-
sium. Music as a muscular
and a gymnastic exercise is
practised to a powerful ex-
tent at certain schools, but
we never before heard of an
establishment entirely de-
voted to such exercise. We
can imagine with what
energy the professors dis-
play their muscle and their
music, just by way of stimulant to the talent of their pupils. We can
conceive Here Strumundthump, the eminent piano gymnast,
instructing them in the fine art of deafening an audience by their
muscular display. Pieces like the dreadful Bailie of Prague—or
is it Plague P—would probably without ceasing be dinned into our
ears, and our fair torturers would have a variety of torments ready for
us literally at their fingers' ends.
Musical gymnastics are sometimes of a vocal sort, and sometimes
instrumental. We have the memory of both still ringing in our ears,
and hardly know which struck us at the period of performance as the
more surprising and the more unpleasant. At some of the most
musical, most melancholy parties to which we have the painful pleasure
to be constantly invited, young ladies perform wondrous feats of
musical activity, which could only he accomplished by long gymnastic
training. The rapidity wherewith they clamber up and down the
gamut, and the amazing leaps they take in reaching a high note, can
only be attained by a laborious course of practice. We own we have
no sympathy with these muscular musicians. We always pity the
piano which such gymnasts so belabour; and the more astonishing
the feats which they accomplish, the more we feel inclined to wish
they were impossible.

"The threatened exodus of the working power from Natal was beginning

CIGARETTE PAPERS.
No. III.—MY AUNTS GREAT POLICE CASE.
Eleven o'Clock. We drive up to the Police-Court, and'get as near
as we can to it; that is, the cab stops at the entrance of an alley, and,
down the alter, among a number of squalid dwellings and a flaring
public-house, ts the Police-Court.
"It's a shame." exclaims my Aunt, "that they don't build finer
places for Police-Courts!"
She would have had a Palace of Justice specially erected for this
occasion.
We come upon a crowd of unwashed people herding abont'the
entrance: women who have been having their eyes blacked with a
few strong touches, a little blue being artistically thrown in, and
dissipated, unshaven ruffians lounging against the walls with the air of
habitues as no doubt they are. A sort of dirty parody, on fops' alley
on an opera night.
We struggle into the passage.
"I wonder if my Cabman's here P" my Aunt says. We have, both,
a sort of feeling that he may dart out upon us vindictively, from some-
where, and that the police will side with him.
"Where's the Court P" says my Aunt to me. She is very nervous
about being on the spot in exact time, because she has heard that a
summoned person, not appearing, is immediately committed for con-
tempt of Court.
"Is this," I ask, addressing a Policeman, who, I suppose, hears
me, though he doesn't show any signs of doing so, "Is this.the way to
the CourtP"
The official, without altering his position (he is leaning against, and,
as' it were, across the door, so as to make a slanting barrier of himself,
and perhaps is suspicious of treachery on my Aunt's or my part)
replies "Yes."
i inform my Aunt that this is the way into the Court. She wishes
me to inquire if the Magistrate is in.
I think over this for a minute, and consider how to put the question
pleasantly, and yet so as not to induce the Policeman to think I'm
laughing at him. I propose (to myself) to put it thus: "Is the
Magist rate in P" but that looks as if we were merely making a morning
call, and is, on the whole, too familiar. The same objection applies to
"Is the Magistrate at home P" I begin, "Is the Magistrate "and
am going to say, "sitting P" but it occurs to me that this treats the
Magistrate like a hen.
The Policeman helps me out. Without yielding an inch of his
vantage ground, so as to be prepared againstany attempt at a surprise
on the part of my Aunt or myself, he says, austerely, " He ain't come
yet."
"O, indeed! When will he come P"
"Don't know."
The oracle shuts his month, and is silent.
"And we shall have to wait ever so long," This my Aunt whispers to
me, nervously indignant, "Among these people! Good gracious! 1 'm
sure we shall catch something horrid!"
A door is open on our left, and within I tee a desk, two CleTks, and
a Police-sergeant, or some official higher than an ordinary Policeman,
engaged in looking over a large ledger.
As an ingenious way of getting out of the crowd, I suggest our
stepping into this office.
"Tell them you 're a Barrister," my Aunt whispers. I don't see
what good this would do; and if I did tell them, in a place like a
Police-Court where everybody is suspected and suspicious, how am
I to prove it P
We step in. Nobody takes any notice of us, so I propose taking
notice of somebody, just to account for our being there.
I address the man, who looks like a Clerk, affably, wondering what
station he fills, and whether he is a Clerk or not. My .'Aunt impresses
me strongly with the necessity of being civil—very civil—to these
officials, as she whispers (she does nothing here but whisper
mysteriously in my ear), this may be of use to us, and perhaps (this
is her leading idea), this young man may be the Magistrate's nephew.
(It turns out afterwards that she once knew a Judge who made his
nephew the Clerk of Arraigns, and she considers it the usual thing.)
I say "good morning" to the Clerk. I feel instinctively that my Aunt
behind me is smiling on him, and I despise myself, and her, for fawning
upon creatures in power: but I do it.
The Clerk nods.
"I suppose we may step in here till the Magistrate comesP"
I inquire, still pleasaiitly. Fawning, both of us.
"Yes," answers the Clerk, carelessly.
"Thank you, Sir," says my Aunt, gratefully.
I am not sorry for this, aa if the Cabman is outside in the passage,
he may be attended by his sympathising friends, and the meeting might
be unpleasant. We remain in the office, and we converse about nothing
particular in whispers, until I begin to foresee a difficulty in regaining
our natural tones.
A stout man buttoned up to the chin (aa inspector probably),
walks in.
"Tomkins and Barker downP" asks the last-comer of the
Sergeant.
"Same as before," answers the latter, writing on a bit of paper, and
handing it across to the Clerk, who inspects it, and obserres that
"It'sail right."
Then the Inspector looks at the Clerk, and remarks that "Time's
getting on;" then the Sergeant closes his ledger, locks it up, and
putting a bunch of keys in his pocket, also remarks that "It it
getting late;" whereupon the Clerk, shutting up his book, and
coming out from behind his enclosure, caps the other two observations
by saying forcibly that " It will be later afore we've done ;" at which
witticism we, in our character of sycophants, feel bound, to smile, and
do so accordingly.
The ice being thus broken, I ask, on behalf of my Aunt, when our
case will come on; at least, I explain (so as not to lead to future
complications), "Not my case, but this lady's, my Aunt's;" this I add
as if the Clerk had been my bosom friend for years, and I was intro-
ducing my relative to him.
"NameP" says he. I give the name. "It's down",for No. two
on the list."
"It '11 be heard after the night cases."
"When," ventures my Aunt, timidly, "do you think it will be heard P"
"Ah! can't say," returns the Clerk. "You see a message has just
come down about Ma. Wigoimthorpe's having met with an accident,
and so Mr. Sharply will run up from t'other Court, when he's
heard the cases down there."
"Good gracious!" exclaims my Aunt, "then if there are many
cases at the other Court, mine mayn't be heard for hours."
"P'raps not," replies the Clerk, carelessly, and turns to speak to a
friend who has dropped in to have a chat by the fire.
The Inspector corroborates the Clerk's statement. Mr. Sharply
will be quick enough when he does come, but that may be in a quarter
of an hour, or that very minute, or not for two hours yet.
The glorious uncertainty of the Law is on this occasion represented
by Mr. Sharply.
"Perhaps," my Aunt thinks. "the Cabman will get tired of waiting,
and then won't appear, after all."
This idea of tiring out the Cabman is a congenial one to my Aunt's
mind, and if we could only have some luncheon, the morning would
not hang so heavily on our hands as at present it most certainly does.
We are becoming quite accustomed to the Police-Office, ana almost
attached to its fire, when the Sergeant intimates, sotto voce, that if we
like to sit down inside the Court until the Magistrate comes, he can
let us in.
He puts this as a favour, in the same sort of confidential manner
that a Railway Guard offers to keep a carriage for you for "the
through journey."
I put my hand in my waistcoat pocket, hinting at a shilling (which I
subsequently give him, and feel I am suborning a probable witness),
and we are passed in, the official forming the slanting barrier afore-
mentioned withdrawing himself to let us pass. I fancy the Sergeant
and that official will share my shilling.
In Court. Small room. Dirty representatives of the general public
behind a wooden railing. In front of them the dock. In the centre,
at a table covered with green baize, are seated elderly respectable
I gentlemen, looking as if they'd all had their black waistcoats cut out of
[ the same piece of satin. They have papers before them, and are (we hit
I upon it at once) the Solicitors. On their left is a something between
a pew and a school-desk. One man sits there. "A reporter," I suggest,
and he becomes immediately an object of intense interest to my Aunt.
On the right is a Policeman in a private box, reading a newspaper. At
the other end of the room is a raised stage, as if for a performance. It
is fitted with a table-desk, a chair, and a screen to conceal a door in
the wall. Quite gives one the idea of an entertainment. Magistrate
suddenly .to appear from behind screen, taking every one by surprise,
and then going through a round of favourite characters, changing his
dress and wigs under his table, and popping up aa somebody else.
Solicitors in front to represent stalls, or orchestrr.
Clerk sits just below and in front of the table-desk. He is placed
sideways, and appears to be peculiarly uncomfortable, having evidently
insufficient room for his legs, which, if stretched, would, as it were,
stand out by themselves, and spoil the picture.
"Where are we to go P" my Aunt asks, nervously.
As we can't join the public behind the rail, and will be certainly out
of place with the Policeman iu his private box (only licensed to hold
one), I choose the pew where the Reporter is.
We seat ourselves, and listen to the Solicitors, who are laughing and
chatting loudly, chiefly (it appears from the conversation, which is almost
unintelligible to us) on professional matters.
A lady, smelling strongly of rum, joins us in the pew. She is much
interested in what we may be here for.

"Is it an assault case f" she asks my Aunt.
"0 dear no," replies my Aunt; "it's only a summons."
Sbe says this as if there was nothing out of the way in her being
here for such an ordinary affair.
"Summons for assault," persists the Hum Lady, eyeing my Aunt,
as if contrasting her muscular power with her own.
I come to her relief. I explain, "A summons for a cab-fare."
"O1" says the Rum Lady, her interest evidently considerably
diminished; adding proudly, "Mine's assault."
We both say " Indeed! and my Aunt edges away from her towards
the Reporter. The Rum Lady, being once started, proceeds to inform
us that her landlady (whom she points out in the crowd behind the
rail—a villainous-looking one-eyed hag) had accused her of stealing the
counterpane and sheets.
"But you didn't P " I say; compassionately.
"Didn't 1 '* she exclaims, in an energetic under-tone. "I soon showed
her 1 didn't." She is a big powerful woman, and, with rum, a decidedly
awkward customer. I apologise; I mean, I say, that she is here
wrongfully accused. Upon this she winks slowly at me first, and then
nudges my Aunt to enjoy the joke. This freemasonry being finished,
she assumes an air of great caution, and whispers to us to take care,
as Old Pukkiss is looking, adding, " I hate that Pcrkiss."
We ascertain that Pukkiss, the object of her detestation is one of
the respectable-looking elderly gentlemen at the table. "He 'a often
been against me, he has," she continues, always in a whisper, and
avoiding the eye of Old Pukkiss, who is, it seems, on this memorable
occasion also, engaged by the opposite side.
An hour passes in this lively manner. I think we all take to
watching Old Pukkiss; if we flag at all in this interesting occupa-
tion, the Rum Lady nudges us, and nodding towards him,
whispers, "That Pukkiss!" fiercely. "Well," says my Aunt, who
is beginning to feel faint, "I'd sooner have paid the man twice over
than have gone through this." The clock strikes two: there is a
slight stir among the Solicitors and their papers. The Policeman folds
np his newspaper, and evidently means business. Two other Policemen
come in, the Clerk sits upright in his chair and poises a pen. In
another second there is a bang and a slam, the screen shakes, and a
little geatleman bounds from behind it (quite in keeping with the idea
of an entertainment, or a transformation of somebody into clown in a
pantomime), and brings himself up with a jerk behind the desk-table,
on which he places both hands.
The Reporter informs us in an undertone that this is 11r. Sharplt,
the Magistrate.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR ROUGHS AND RULERS.
ossirly the immediate neigh-
bourhood of D o wnin g S treet
itself is too remote from.the
Home Office to enable the
Government to interfere,
even on the most urgent
occasion, with rioters, for
the suppression of disorder.
No wonder, then, that a
contemporary the other day
announced, as follows, the
institution and operations of
"A Vigilance Committee
at IsLineroN.—Last even-
ing about twenty inhabitants,
armed with stout canes, pa-
trolled Upper Street, Isling-
ton, for some hours; the part
of a oommittee composed en-
tirely of respectable inha-
bitants of the vicinity for the
purpose of suppressing the
rowdyism which lor some time
past has disgraced the neigh-
bourhood on a Sunday evening.
As light fines imposed by the
Magistrates on the offenders
have done little or nothing to
abate the nuisance, the com-
mittee hare resolved, at all
hazards, to administer summary justice in every case where the offenders are
caught in the act."
This resolution they carried out on Sunday last week, with the effect
thus narrated:—
"The committee seemed for the first hour or so to be well occupied, and a
score or two of well-caned backs and shoulders will testify to the justice dealt
out. The roughs were completely puzzled, and the police evidently delighted
with the new state of things; and as the word was rapidly passed from one
gang to another, in a very short time horse-play had almost entirely ceased.
The roughs, finding their fun stopped, left the street in disgust, and parties
returning from their places of worship were surprised to find that they could
walk home unmolested."
What a very agreeable surprise! Inability to walk home from
church without being mobbed and assaulted is by no means so slight
an inconvenience as to be nothing when you are used to it. But, after
you have been used to it a certain length of time, you get to take it as
a nuisance of course, from which you don't expect to be delivered.
When, therefore, on some floe evening, you unexpectedly find that you
are, you naturally feel surprise of an agreeable nature. The surprise,
however, experienced by the Islington congregations at their deliver-
ance from molestation by street-ruffians was not so great as it might
have been. They were surprised to find themselves delivered by a
Vigilance Committee; but they would have been much more surprised
if the streets bad been cleared of ruffians by the police, acting under
orders. Islington is a settlement in the far North, in a great measure
necessitated to manage its own affairs. Even the inhabitants of West-
minster, residing close to the seat of executive Administration, would
be extremely surprised, and no less delighted, if the police, by order of
Government, were to prevent the next threatened demonstration of
seditious roughs. If it is not so prevented, perhaps the respectable
people of the Strand and Trafalgar Square will some of them also
resolve themselves into a Vigilance Committee, like the dwellers at
Islington and San Francisco. In that case, also, we may hope that
"weD-caned backs and shoulders will testify to the justice dealt out,"
and that "the roughs," being "completely puzzled," and "finding
their fun stopped," will very speedily leave the pavement "in disgust.
No doubt the police will be immensely " delighted with the new state
of things," namely, public order, and their proper function of preserving
it discharged by a Vigilance Committee.
As to Islington, the above-quoted narrative concludes with the no-
tification that
"The Committee will resume their duties on Sunday evening next."
That is to say, they will reassume the duties of the police; let us hope
till further notice, until it occurs to the authorities that we pay the said
police to do the work which is being done at Islington by gentlemen.
EHYME WITHOUT REASON.
"Suxxsr Fmieitds," one of Clartrel's latest songs, is advertised
with an illustrative stanza (on the same principle as the man who had a
house to let carried about a brick as a specimen), thus:—
"Where are thy summer friends,
Friends of thy youth f _
Gone with the summer birds
Back to the South."
This leaves it uncertain whether, in order to rhyme, "youth" should
be sung "t/owth," or "south" "tuth." We shall be told, of course,
that the rhyme is addressed to the eye not to the ear. By such a
canon the following lines may, possibly, be deemed melodious:—
Feasant Arcadian,
Guiding the plough;
Coarse are your garments,
Your aspeot is rough.
Beleaguered and Bellicose.
No wonder the French Government of Defence refused to listen to
any terms of armistice which did not permit the revictualling of Paris.
That Government is simply Provisional.
I hear you've a cough;
Do you feel sure

Bibulous peasant,
Your voice it is rough;
You 're no disciple
Of temperate Gough.
Home to your cottage
You hear the wind's sough,
Even the birdies
Sing hoarse on the bough.
Home to your cottage
And bend o'er the trough,
Kneading in loaves
The digestible dough.
Though the bread's heavy,
Unyielding and tough,
Chawbacon's teeth
Will get easily through.

men at present resident in this country who may be desirous of
mastering the peculiarities of English pronunciation.

THE SOVEREIGN OF SOUTHAMPTON.
"P. M. Decius bis Consul," was a great man. Whtttdigton,
thrice Lord Mayor of London, was not a small one. Bat what was
either to Mr. Perkins, five times Mayor of Southampton!
Royal families are all related. Five Mayoralties of Southampton in
succession give a sum-total of dignity not far removed from Royalty.
So Perkins may be considered as fairly entitled to take that warm
interest in the doings of the Sovereign and her family, which has found
graceful expression in the fancy-ball he has lately given in honour of
the betrothal of Princess Louise to the Marquis of Lorne. We
are glad to learn from our old friend Jenkins that " the Ball was a
great success: that 1500 guests were present, and that the hospitality
of the entertainer merited all praise." Also that " the Lord of Lorne
Lancers were danced for the first time." But the exhilaration of this
thrilling piece of news is a good deal dashed by the painful information
that "the Marqufs of Lorne was prevented from accepting the
Mayor's invitation." After this it is as much as we or Jenkins can
do to brighten up at sight of "the crystal star over the entrance of
the Hartley Institution," with the pointed and original motto—little
less brilliant than the crystal star itself—"England and Scotland
United"; to which all that is wanting to give point to the happy
double entendre are the dates of the double event—1707 and 1870.
But the crystal star over the door of the Institute was not the star
of the evening. That was Perkins, "wearing the uniform of Admiral
of the Port"!!!—"a very ancient office," Jenkins is careful to add,
"conferred by charter on the town"—(and therefore fitly personified
by Perkins, who is the sublimation or quintessence of Southampton
in the flesh—a sort of Lierig's essence of the City of Bevis)—" and
held to extend"—our breath almost fails us in the attempt to follow
such a sweep of power—"down to Langston Harbour below Ports-
mouth"! Ill
Perkins, in bis uniform as Admiral of the Port (the colour, cut,
and material of which Jenkins wisely leaves to the imagination),
attended by the Mayoress, "received their guests in the Museum."
But who could have had eyes for any of the curiosities of the Museum,
primeval or pre-Adamite, in the presence of Perkins as Port-Admiral!
The company," Jen kins goes on to say,
"Included the ilite of the town and neighbourhood, in addition to the civic
authorities of other places, and many distinguished visitors from London and
distant pat U of the country. The dresses were rich and varied, ranging from
the very primitive garb of the North American Indian to the gorgeous cos-
tumes of the seventeenth century. Thit entertainment brought to a close the
fifth year o/Hr. Perkins's mayoralty."
How Imagination pants in the attempt adequately to picture that
solemn and stately close of the fifth reign of Perkins—between a
primitively-garbed Red Indian and a gorgeous Charles the Second
in a ringlet wig and yellow boots!
Shallow scoffers may say that these things are not fairly matters of
more than local concern—if of that. Southampton, Jenkins, Perkins
know better. When they make them the subject of paragraphs in
our London papers, shall not Mr. Punch point their morals and adorn
their tales for a loyal British public by a resounding roo-too-it on his
trumpet of fame P

VOTE FOR THE LADIES.
OTE for the Three
Ladies who oftvr
themselves in dif-
ferent districts, as
candidates for elec-
tion to the Metro-
politan Sch ool
Board: Miss Gar-
rett, M.D., Mks.
Grey, and Miss
Davies.
Of course you all
know that the Lon-
don School Board
is to consist of
forty - nine mem-
bers, and that its
duties will be to
report on all exist-
ing schools in the
Metropolitan dis-
tricts, and to esta-
blish new schools,
where the Board
thinks it necessary.
It is to settle the
amount of school
fees, and when
necessary, to com-
pel parents to send
to school all chil-
dren between five
and thirteen.
Does not this seem exactly the sort of superintendence which should he shared by
ladies, who are not only really interested in education (that is a good thing, but not
enough), but who are acquainted with the humbler classes, and know their habits, preju-
dices, and difficulties P
Mr. Punch thinks that this is woman's work, and he hopes that the three ladies will be
elected for Marylebone, Chelsea, and Greenwich respectively. As for Miss Garrett,
who, to her long practical acquaintance with the above things, adds sound medical
knowledge, and can advise on all sanatory questions connected with schools, she will be
an invaluable acquisition to the Board; and Marylebone should be proud that the
richest and most educated of the districts can send to that Council one who will
render such services. Miss Garrett and the other ladies profess no "strong-minded
women's " doctrines, but those which all rational men would teach.
There are some very good men in the candidature, but they are well known, and
can speak for themselves. Mr. Punch, only wishes to point out that three ladies desire
to do Woman's Work, and he hopes that they will be accredited to the Board. He
seldom condescends to treat of mere political elections, but these Educational Elections
are important, and wise men had belter look to them.

NEW POSTAL ARRANGEMENTS.
Which, beinq rather less puzzling than the latent issued
from tlie O P. 0., are strongly recommended to
official consideration :—
1. That the Halfpenny Cards shall not be charged
with a penny stamp, under certain penalties made
and provided.
2. That the charge by book-post shall be one
halfpenny for every book not exceeding a certain
weight at the discretion of the authorities. The
weight to vary from time to time.
3. Any writing or printing on or in the packet
going by book-post to be considered as a letter and
charged accordingly.
4. Any writing in or on a newspaper will
cause the paper to be charged as a letter.
5. Any writing on or in a packet going by
Sample Post if in the nature of a Letter or a Com-
munication to be charged according to the penalties
to be enforced for attempted evasions of the Act
in question.
SHAKSPEARE IN COMFORT.
Mr. Punch complained two weeks ago that he
couldn't find a comfortable seat in a theatre.
Having been round the theatrical world, he settled
himself at last at The Globe. Here he had an elegant
and capacious stall, plenty of room for his hat and
bis legs. Here he sat and saw Shaksprare's
eccentric farce of Taming the Shrew, with Christopher
Sly out, which is, to his thinking, a pity. Mr.
Punch, on his word of gallantry, is of opinion that
the Katherine of the Globe is too gentle throughout;
but be really was so comfortable that he was quite
annoyed when a stall-keeper, in the most civil
manner possible, pointed out to him that they were
covering up the boxes, and that he was the last
person in the house. So he woke up and left;
hut it was entirely owing to the luxurious seat
that he did not see the dance of the Colonna, Ex-
Princess of the Alhambra, a terpsichorean exhibi-
tion pronounced by the press and the police to
be the most decorous they have seen for years.

BEARS AT THE BAR.
Sir,—My husband's a Barrister, but as he only laughs when I ask
him to explain legal matters to me, I refer to you.
That he should laugh I look upon as a part of the rudeness of
Lawyers generally, and fully bears out the very points I had asked him
about.
Isn't it the height of ill-breeding to get up and go away when anyone's
speaking to you?
Yes.
And yet Sir (as I said to my husband) what do we read perpetually
in the Law reports P why this sort of thing,
"Counsel was proceeding to consider the effect of the Canons of 1603, when
the Court adjourned."
Isn't this rude f If I'd been the Counsel I'd have followed them
out and given them a bit of my mind. If this is the effect of a " legal
education " no child of mine shall go to such a school.
Then again :—
"The learned Serjeant was in the middle of his argument, when the Court
rose."
It's positively indecent. But it's just what my husband does when
I'm in the middle of an argument. Now I know where he picks up
such manners. Juries are nearly as bad. For instance a Judge the
other day bad kindly "reserved a point to go to the Jury "—wonderful
politeness on his part—and what did the Jury do f Why look here,
"The jury retired, and have not yet returned."
"Not yet!" and this was days ago!!
It served the Judge right, 1 've no doubt, if he himself had been in
the habit of rising and going away when a Counsel was talking.
Two words more on the slyness of Magistrates, and I've done.
The Middlesex Magistrates meet to discuss various matters. Their
work is tedious, but they must get through it. Naturally they are
hungry, and if so, why not say, "Gentlemen, the public will excuse us
for an hour: let us go to lunch." But, no! they can't be outspoken:
but they allow a report to appear in the paper, which says—
"The members of the Court then retired to the Magistrates' private rooms,
to consider, as was believed, the more important items of the proposed esti-
mate, and the Court adjourned."
The italics are mine. "As was believed," that is, "at they gave out."
I know the sort of thing. Just as my husband telegraphs to me to say
that business detains him at Chambers, and, a few days after, one of his
boon companions comes here and lets out what a jolly dinner they 'd
had at the Club on that very night. Of course, these members of the
Court retired to lunch in the Magistrates' private room, and were
"believed" by the credulous public to be engaged in its own interest.
Ah! when will women be in power!
I am, Sir, yours sincerely,

belong to the Roman Pontiffs personally, having been constructed,
furnished, decorated, and kept up by successive Popes, at expenses
defrayed out of their privy purses. The Popes have been men of

more than St. Peter left behind him. Apostolic poverty is no heir-

"The Pope is carrying out hia programme with unwavering rigour. For

the church of Sun Carlo al Corso, and did not solemnise the usual oeremony
at the high altar of St. Peter's. Nor did he celebrate the festival of All
Saints, nor hold a cappclla papalt on the ' day of the dead,' a solemnity of
immemorial usage."
His Holiness, in fact, has begun to strike. If the Italian Govern-
ment do not succumb to him, he will probably soon have struck
altogether. Then what will the Roman tradesmen do for the cus-
tomers who were wont to be attracted to the Eternal City by the
papal pageantries? Perhaps he will go farther than to the mere
extent of a personal strike. Not long ago he was reported to have
said La tradizione son to. If he says that he is la tradizione, he may
just as well call himself la chiesr. So, indeed, he is, in effect, now
that he has been constituted infallible. Now, if the Pope is the
Church in himself, he also, for striking purposes, constitutes an
ecclesiastical equivalent to a Trades' Union; and is able, not only
himself to strike, but can also compel the whole of his subordinate
ecclesiastics to strike too. At his command, then, the priests, not of
Rome only, but likewise of all Italy, may very soon be the whole of
them on strike. Should any still afford their ministrations to King
Victor-Emmanuel and his Ministers, the Holy Father, in his capacity
of Priests' Union, will have no need to employ unionists to bully,
intimidate, or coerce them into ceasing to perform their functions.
He will be under no necessity of procuring them to be blown up; he
can fulminate against them with the "thunders of the Vatican."
There .will be no occasion for him to have them "rattened," and
deprived of their vestments, missals, and other sacerdotal implements
(not to say tools of their craft), seeing that he will have it in his power
to excommunicate them, if they persist in officiating, or being " knob-
sticks." In all likelihood he will put all Italy, inclusive of Rome,
under an interdict, unless he is reinstated in his temporal power.
0 Romafelix I as the Latin clergy sing. O happy Rome, and Italy
to boot, in being inhabited by people whom an ecclesiastical strike can
be expected to terrify. See what Great Britain has come to because
in this heretical and degraded country, those who would care so much
as a straw for it are in a small minority. Consequently, an enlightened
Pontiff has no means of putting the screw on a faithful multitude with
such an amount of pressure as might ultimately oblige the rulers and
Government of the country to confer upon it the blessings of legisla-
tion based on the principles of the " Syllabus."
DIFFICULTIES OF RITUALISM.
A gentleman deeply interested in ecclesiastical affairs, writes to ns
to complain of the uncertainty existing in the best informed circles as
to the right spelling and right pronunciation of the now famous Mr.
Mackonochie's name. Is it Machonockie, or McOnockie, or
Mackonockie, or Machonokie, or Mackonochie, or MackonokirP
What does it rhyme with P Can I say, asks our Correspondent, who
is composing a hymn-book, noted, *

TWO SECRET DESPATCHES.
My Drar Von Granville, Versailles, Nov. 21.
We—Prussians—were not in your Crimean War, at least not
openly. Had we been engaged, I natter myself that at Treaty-time
our representative wonld have saved you from a blunder, of which you
are now going to enjoy the result. You took no material guarantee
for the observance of Russia's engagements. So, she breaks them at
the first convenient opportunity, and small blame to her. I think that
(D. V.) we intend to be wiser in dealing with a little matter to which
1 need not more pointedly invite to your Excellency's notice.
Receive, &c.
To the Lord Granville. Von Bismarck.
Drar Presidest, st- Petersburg, Nov. ^ 1870.
Now is your time. Send word to England that you must
have a cheque for the Alabama claims, and an abject apology, by return
of post. 1 think it possible that she will hesitate. Then out with your
fleet, and that will keep her too much occupied to meddle in the Black
Sea. In return, you will have Egypt, Pyramids, Sphynx, and all, as
soon as we have garrisoned Constantinople. I would promise yon St.
Sophia, as the hall to an American Oriental University, but my August
Master has a " fad," and wants the church for himself. Go ahead, and
show that our vaunted friendship meant business.

AN OX.
The musical world will have read with interest the subjoined
announcement in the Times:—
Conscience Money.—The Secretary of the Inland Revenue has received,
by the collector of Langboum Ward, from " B. 0. S.," half-notes for £30,
on account of Income-tax.
It may occnr to some musicians that half-notes for £30 on ac-
count of Income-tax, will, when re-united to their other halves, amount
to what is familiarly called a pretty tune. This consideration may
suggest to Income-tax payers, that if the pipe of peace should be
broken with Russia to the tune of some hundreds of millions, they
alone will have to pay the piper. In that case, anybody who pays any
more Income-tax than he can help, and voluntarily sends any money
"on account" of it to the Chanckllor of the Exchequer, or the
Secretary of the Inland Revenue, may well sign himself
"B. O. S." 11 is name would be Bovis in the genitive case; he would
be a beef-headed fellow, and a Blessed Old Simpleton.
A Crying Evil.
"The nuisance of the newavendore is extreme, and must, before long, call
for police regulation."
This was written of an Italian city, but it applies with equal force to
one much nearer home—London, where deafness will soon be con-
sidered rather an advantage than an affliction, if successive (and
often superfluous) editions of the daily papers continue to be allowed
to be proclaimed with exasperating raucity and aggravating fre-
quency; a nuisance rapidly growing into one almost as great as the
street organ, but which some of us fancy might be brought under
police regulation.

AH ! IF THEY KSOWED THE LOBD MAYOR AS WELL AS YOU AND I, BlLL, THEY
WOULDN'T MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT Bill I"
"NOT LOOSE YET."
Some fifteen years since Europe watched
A bloody bout of "Bait the Bear";
Baiters and baited were well matched.
And hard the knocks both had to share.
At last the baiters won the fight,
And left the Bear in evil plight.
With fangs knocked oat, claws rent away,
And tattered ears and muzzle torn,
Licking his bleeding wounds he lay,
Spent, scarred, and sore, faint and forlorn:
Too weak to struggle, as they past
A rope about his shoulders vast,
And hugged him, a reluctant heap,
In spite of idle snarl and growl,
Up to a stake that, planted deep,_
Defied sharp claws and armed jowl,
To tear up, pull down, or gnaw through,
And bound him with a chain thereto.
Since that time Bruin's wounds have healed,
His fangs and claws have grown again;
The fur, once from red gashes peeled,
Has grown o'er scars that still remain,
Till Bruin feels, with strength renewed,
Old hankerings for the Turkey brood.
But each move on his would-be prey
Reveals the check of post and chain:
In vain he tugs, to wrench away
The post, his tether gnaws in vain.
The stake is strong, the chain is sound,
And Master Bruin firmly bound.
Bat lo, at last, a chance appears!
The Gallic cock o'er-mastered lies,
On broader wings through wider spheres
Mis friend the German eagle flies.
Who stays his efforts to be free f
The British Lion I What is he?
A poor, old, toothless, fangless brute,
Big-boned still, but no longer strong,
Crippled by sleeping at the root
Of Evil, lazily and long,
Prizing its golden fruitage far
Beyond the dusty palms of war.
"He will not lift his helpless head,
He will not ope his sleepy eye,
To splinters though the post 1 shred,
And make the chain in flinders fly.
Turkey's his friend; but there it ends:
He doesn't fight to save his friends.".
So Bruin gave his post a tug,
And Bruin gave his chain a shake,
And roared—from Dnieper unto Bug,—
"Take heed, allP The great Bear's awake!
He doth hereby, ignore his chain,
And doffs it, ne'er to don again!"
The British Lion heard him roar,
And raised from 'twixt his paws his crest,
And, checking a suspended snore,
His sleepy bulk to speech add res t,—
"Ignore your chain! I wish you joy!
But you've to get it off, my boy.
"And ere you do that, brother Bear,
You'1l have to square accounts with mc,
As well as with our old friends there,
Eagles of Austria, Italy,
And, iast, not least, Dame Turkey here,
Tor whom your love is so sincere,
"That, with your will, you'1l never rest
Till she is fast between your paws,
Safe 'neath their shield as in a nest.
If she don't run upon your claws.
If Turkey this don't seem to see,
No wonder it's not clear to me.
"We tied you up to keep her safe,
When your affection waxed too warm;
Against the chain howe'er you chafe,
That chain is still 'twixt her and harm.
Bemember, pray, howe'er sharp set,
My worthy Bear, you're not loose yet!"
A SAD DISCLOSURE.
"BISMAHCK.—What am I to do? I cannot exist without
you?"
Such was the passionate, heart-rending appeal which ap-
peared in the Times but a few days ago. There are those who
believe the great German Count to be a Machiavelli: we
fear now there is too much reason to suspect that he is also
a Don Giovanni. We call upon him—a married man, be it
remembered—to satisfy the Great Powers, if he can, that
he has not, in the midst of war, diplomacy, the demands of
Russia, and the unification of Germany, been trifling with
the affections of some young and trusting female. If he
cannot, and it is an Englishwoman, who has thus, through
the medium of a public advertisement, made known her
inability to live without the Chancellor of the German
Confederation, we do not see how our Ambassador can
remain twenty-four hours longer at Berlin, without demand-
ing his passports. We must then send our Fleet into
Prussian waters and submit to an additional Income-tax.

PUNCH'S ESSAYS.

"It U Byron's writing, and here U his name." —Love's Labour's Lost.
ur friends the Lithu-
anians have a pro-
verb that a man's
Hand is a man's
Mind; the inhabi-
tants of Mongrelia,
deriving- the idea
from the Saabian,
say Characters show
Character; and there
are experts amongst
ourselves who, for
a moderate fee. pro-
fess to be able to
tell, from examina-
tion of a scrap of
writing, what are
the writer's moral
qualities and favour-
ite dishes, whether
he is possessed of
sterling principles
and funded pro-
perty, how many
miles he can walk
in the hour, when
'e began to lose his
hair, at what period
of his life he formed
an unrequited attachment, and many other equally interesting par-
ticulars. Perhaps the confidence they have in their discrimination of
character by the test of penmanship will suffer a reverse when they
hear that Nero, the cruel, wrote a dainty, graceful, feminine hand,
with the loops of the «'s conscientiously formed, and every i com-
plete to the minutest point, while the benevolent John Howard's
epistles are in letters an inch long, a mass of blots and splashes,
hardly legible even by the oldest playgoer.
The thirst for collecting specimens of the handwriting of famous
and infamous persons is one of the most deep-seated in the human
breast, and has prevailed in almost every great crisis of the world's
history from the time of the Franks. To gratify it, men have before
now denied themselves the common luxuries of life, and faced the
densest fogs in the most tortuous lanes of the City of London. It is
on record that the competition for a hasty note written by Joan or Axe
to her dressmaker, was the origin of a duel between two rival collectors
in one of the strongholds of feudalism; and Scrirlerus has an
amusing story of an enthusiastic pastry-cook who made the Grand
Tour in his pony-carriage, in search of the long-lost MS. of Mrs.
Rundell's receipt for stewed kidneys, which he found at last, at day-
break, in Pope Boniface's hat-box. It is much to be regretted that
Mr. Robinson Crusoe was not a collector, for then he would have pre-
served one of the most remarkable autographs ever discovered, by
carefully excavating Friday's footwriting—bos signature in the sand,—
and bequeathing it, eventually, to the Museum belonging to his native
town.
Autographs have encountered strange vicissitudes of fortune. That
of William the Conqueror, contained in a copy of Doomsday Book
in the original binding, after being exhibited for many generations in
the Tower, at twopence a-head, unfortunately perished in the Oreat
Fire of London, despite Sir Christopher Wren's strenuous efforts
to save it, continued through the whole of one night; but the diary kept
by Richard Ckur de Lion when he was from home on foreign service,
and in which he entered what he had for dinner every day during his
absence, and what the Princess said to him on a future occasion, and
how the Archery Meeting went off, is still in the possession of an emi-
nent member of the Common Law bar, and would form a desirable
addition to the Camden Society's publications before the winter fairly
sets in.
What would we not give for one of Shakspraer's letters to Anne
Hathaway when they were first engaged, and while their dream of
happiness was still undisturbed by the high price of provisions! How
precious would be a note of Sir John Falstapp's with the Coventry
postmark on the cover! And who would not willingly forego his
annual vacation to be permitted to hold in his hand, between dinner
and tea, the old Duchess op Marlrorough's housekeeping book,
with its methodical account of what was paid to the servants at Blen-
heim when they were on board wages!
The task of the Autograph collector is no slight one. He must be
prepared to brave the fury of the elements, and the envy, hatred, and
jealousy, and all the other cardinal vices, of baffled rivals. He must
practise economy and early rising, and retire to rest at a reasonable
hour, avoiding exposure to the night air and heavy suppers. He must
take long walks in the country, and ransack the cupboards and cabinets
of the resident landowners. He must not show irritability, if he is
roused out of his sleep, about Christmas, by a ring at the front door
bell, and asked in a harried whisper through the key-hole whether he
will give ten guineas for Jonathan Wild's mark, made in the presence
of two Justices of the Peace, and lately discovered, in a fine state of
preservation, in the neighbourhood of Tyburuia. Above all (if he is a
single amateur), he must not hesitate to incur the displeasure of his
relations, by devoting to the acquisition of the entire correspondence
between Arelard and Eloisa, those savings of a long and industrious
career which would otherwise have formed the subject of testamentary
dispositions.
But his reward is great, his compensation is certain. The contem-
plation of his treasures after a late dinner makes the frowns of nephews
unheeded, and the coldness of second cousins a matter of supreme in-
difference. In the society of all the great spirits of the chequered
past, of [all the bright orbs of the luminous present—Thomas a
Kempis and Tom Sayers, Mark Antony and Mark Akenslde,
Martin Luther and Martin Tupper, Guido and Guido Fawkes,
Don Quixote (behold him on left) and Don Juan, Horace and
Horace Smith, Braumont and Fletcher, Kirey and Spence
Chaplin and Horns, and the leading Members of the Stock Exchange
—he can hear with tranquillity of the fall of dynasties and the decline
of the Imperial purple ; and absorbed in the inspection of the unique
but utterly illegible sign manual of Charlemagne, or the-fine Roman
hand of Cincinnatus, he can disregard the repeated applications of a
fellow enthusiast (but in a different line), the tax-collector, and be for-
getful alike of the movements of specie and the fashionable arrivals at
St. Leonard's-on-Ser.

Humftt Dumptt had a great fall. So have the various Stocks this
week in the Money Market. They, however, will rise again without
the aid of the Queen's horses, by that of a comparatively few of her

of the Treaty which forbids Russia to rob Turkey. Thus you see its
cause was a Bear speculation.
A POWER OF THE KEYS.
According to a letter from Rome, the keys of the Quirinal Palace
were demanded the other day for Victor-Emmanuel. Commen-
datore Spagna had consigned them to Cardinal Antonklli. Bis
Eminence had given them into the bands of the Pope. If the Pope
was asked for them, and made any reply, it must have been rion pot-
sumus. In pursuance, therefore, of an order sent by Signor Sella,
from Florence, the Quirinal Palace doors had to be opened by a lock-
smith. Non-papists question the Pope's alleged power of the keys.
They cannot, however, deny that His Holiness had the power to keep
the Quirinal keys in his pocket. It is equally undeniable that, as far
as the Quirinal doors were concerned, the power of the keys was
exercised by a locksmith.

Punch, old man, I congratulate you. You have had a very narrow

a good-sized clothes-basketful of jokes and conundrums. But perhaps
the correction has come too late, and you have already been a sufferer
through this unlucky mis-spelling. If tiis, unfortunately, is so, remem-
bering that you have hardly yet recoverel from the effects of similar
attacks, I shall not be surprised to heir that your physician has
insisted on perfect rest and 'quiet for you and Toby, and that you have
both gone to the sea-side. Growler.

A LOVE-SONG BY A SULKY SUITOR.
Come, live with me and be my wife,
And we will quarrel all our life:
A favour when you'd have me grant,
I briefly shall reply, " I shan't."
When out of town you wish to go.
My answer will be simply " No;
And when you want in town to stay,
By way of change I '11 answer "Nay.'
If in the park you'd ride or walk,
I '11 do my best your whim to baulk:
And when you wish your calls to make,
Elsewhere your steps I '11 bid you take.
Whene'er we meet, my joy 'twill be
To quarrel with your family:
My fun at your best friends I '11 poke.
And fill your drawing-room with smoke.
If a pet lap-dog you would keep,
I will molest him in his sleep;
Give him hard biscuit for bis meals,
And kick him if he howls or squeals.
In short, I '11 contradict, dispute,
Wrangle, find fault, and be a brute:
Have my own way in all I do,
And never think of pleasing you.
If, then, a husband you would have,
Who '11 ever treat you as bis slave.
And make you wretched all your life,
Come, live with me and be my wife.

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
With the Rivals at the Haymarket. Haven't enjoyed a per-
formance for a long time so much as this. Falkland and Julia are
bores, but they always were; and we don't see Howe to get over the
difficulty, except by introducing the knife—knife-and-Falkland—and
cutting out both characters.
Ere this the Rivals has yielded to the new Fairy Comedy, of which,
perhaps, hereafter more. After the Rivals came a piece, called Uncle's
Will, which being by Mr. Smith, is, probably, not from the French.
This piece is evidently designed to give the old Haymarket favourite,
Mr. Rogers, a part worthy of his fame and acknowledged talents.
Seldom has this accomplished comedian been seen to such advantage.
But in our admiration for this gentleman's finished impersonation of
(the name of the character has escaped our memory), we must not
forget the acting of Mr. and Mrs. Kendal, i.e., Miss Madge
Rorertson.
Not a flaw in it. Charming drawing-room piece (and let ns hope
drawing-house piece), deserving a little theatre all to itself, and a large
audience of intellectual attainments from the two-shilling standard
upwards. The Uncle's Will is merely a scene in a comedy, just
enough, and not too much.

Entrance of Mr. Rogers.
Gentleman who'd never seen Buckstone before (to his next stall neigh-
bour). I beg your pardon, Sir. Is that—Buckstone P
His Neighbour (indignantly). No (mollifying in remembrance of his
never having before, fyc.); that's Rogers. (Points the name out in the bill)
[Everybody applauds, and Mr. Kendal and Miss (Mrs.) Madge
Rorertson (Kendal) are deservedly "called" twice before the
curtain (no humbug about it) to receive quite an ovation.
For ourselves, we were so much struck by the confession of the
Gentleman from the Country that we, contrary to all precedent, could
not refrain from getting into conversation with The Man who'd Never
Seen Buckstone! We gave him a cigar, and shared a dozen oysters
with him at the cafe', next door, which lie visited then for the first time,
he said, in his life. He left us there, his last words being that he
should go every night and see Buckstone, and make up for lost time.

Having occasion to refer to our purse, in order to defray the supper
expenses, and to our cigar-case for another havanna, we could not fiad
them. Explanation and references. Awkward, but necessary.

P.S. Purse found (empty). Cigar-case, name and address in it, also,
empty. Identified them, by appointment with the police, at Bow
Street. In the dock, on a charge of robbing old ladies in omnibuses,
was The Man who had Never Seen Buckstone before.

WAR NEWS.
Marshal Bazaine interviewed by our, O.vn Cockalorum, Captain
Dyngwrll. Specially communicated.
Own Respected,
This Gay Militaire
has left the seat of War—
we were sitting down be-
fore Paris at Versailles—
and took a run over to
Cussel to seethe illustrious
Bazaine, and corkscrew
the truth, and nothing but
the truth, out of him some-
how. This Honest Soldier,
meaning Yours Truly,
couldn't, bear to think of a
gallant Marshal being sus-
pected, which he were,
vous comprenny. So lour
Own goes to propose cork-
screw to him, and a fantasia
on the pumps, which came
on' in the Marshal's own
smoking-room. And here's
the merry-go-rounder for
you, all there.
Your Own enters, salutes
in the true militaire style.
Your Own. Sir to you,
Sir; and Sir to you again,
Sir, 'arter that (pleasant as
possible).
Bazaine. Jsseyez-vous, mon Capilaine. (Sit down, my Captain.)
Comment vousportez vous? (How do you doP)
Your Own. Tray bang (very well), merci (thanks), mon Cockalorum
trfes distingue1 (my Cockalorum very distinguished), et (and; here Your
Own took a chair) comment etes-vous, tous, chez vous P (Eow are
you all, at home P)
The Marshal ain't that Alexander the Great you'd expect. His hair
is as white as the Chilly prisoner's was, and there's a peculiar expres-
sion in his left eye, when he winks at you, which makes you see at
once that he's all there when the bell rings, and into scale saddle
and stirrups.
Marshal. Si vous voulezque nous causions un peu ensemble, avecplaisir.
(If you will thatwechat a little together—why, with pleasure.) Esl-ce
que vous fumez? (Is it that you smoke P)
Your Own. Brave Hero de Metz (brave hero of Metz), j'y tout suis
(I am all there).
We lighted up and puffed in silence. "Buvons!" cried the gay
and gallant, ringing the bell. (Let's drink.)

"Let's!" says I.
Moisteners was the word, Sir.
"Now my Conquered Hero," says Your Own, "let's know all about
it. How was you to-day, and how were you to-morrow, and O dear
what can the matter beP
Marshal Bazaine. Je vous prie (I you pray) approchez vous du feu
(approach you of the fire). El, mon Capilaine, maintenant (and now,
my Captain) nous avrons des grogs (we will have some grogs )
The gay and festive sitting was thus begun. _ After a few preliminary
questions as to his having been vaccinated in accordance with the
provisions of the Act, and as to his having had the measles early,
hooping-cough, scarlatina, chicken-pox, and so forth,—
"Now," says this intelligent and light-hearted Soldier, "Ya-t il
longtemps que vous exercez la profession de Marichal de France?" (Is
it a long time that you exercise the profession of Marshal of France P )
[By the way, Your Own Light-hearted Soldier being no end at lan-
guages generally, but not parleyvooing in that greased-wheel style
which is his forte in German, hit upon the admirable plau of an inter-
leaved Conversation Book, as a sort of easy question-putter; and this
Ingenious Militaire selected a chapter on " Engaging Servants," which,
with a little fitting up and arranging, and a touch or two of Your
Owu's peculiar mixture, came in quite the correct card, my Noble
Marquis.]
"Oai, mon Capilaine," he answered. (Yes, my Captain.) "Encore
des grogs" (More grogs.)
Your Own. Mon galant Cockalornm, (this is my own French,) Quel
age avez vous? (Bow old are you P That's from the Conversation
Book.)
Marshal (accurately), J'ai (But that's a secret. The downy
old Eero also hinted at the date of his birthday. Wasn't he tickling
for presents P But this Acute Soldier's name is sometimes Walker on
the Grampim Hills.)
Your 0'on. Etes vous marie"?
Marsh 4 (sighing). Oni. (Yes.) [More grogs.
Your Own. Savez-vorts monter a chevalP (Do you know how to go on
horseback v)
Marshal (indignantly). Moi! (Me !— not that Lindley Murray he
might be, ehP) (Emphatically) Non. (No.) [More grogs.
Your Own. Savez-vont panser un chevalP (Do you know how to take
care of a horse P)
Marshal. Tree bien. (Jocosely) Jeprends garde d'un eheval. toujovrs.
[Cheers, tears, and laughter. More grogs.
Your Own. Eh bien! mon invulnerable Jo Miller de Me1z, etes vous
toujours propre et [bien habilliP (Are you always quite the Noble
Marquis aud well costumed P)
Marshal (smirking). Oui. (Yes.)
Your Own (pointedly). Why did you come out of Metz, my Unsub-
dued Cockalorum?
Marshal (winking knowingly). 'Cos I didn't stay in. [Takes grogs.
Your Own (having noted down the above answer). Now, then, my
Conquered Hero, weren't you horrid bustled when the Prooshians
came P
Marshal (much affected). Horrid. [More grogs.
Your Own (wiping a trickier from his mauly cheek, and passing the
bottle). Don't cry, my Vanquished Cockalorum! There 'a more
(alluding to the trickier) where that came from. Now, look here.
Weren't your officers and men all over the shop (tout sur le magasin) P
Marshal (proudly). Oui, mon Capilaine. (Yes, my Captain.)
[More grog*.
Your Own (sternty). Vous grisezvous? (Are you given to drinkmsr ?)
The Marshal (at his tenth grog—enthusiastically). Oui! Five
L'Empereur I
"Hooray!" says Your Own, ever ready to sympathise with misfor-
tune: and round the room we went to a festive measure which this
Gay Marquis carolled.
"A bas Bismarck!" shouted I he nero, dancing.
"Bah, bah, black sheep, or Blackheath!" ciies this wild child of
Nature's own regiment.
"Encore des grogs!" shouted the gallant Conquered Hero, disap-
pearing beneath the three-legged mahogany. So Your Own left him
alone in his glory.
And now you've hsd the truth from the Marshal's own lips, don't
you believe anything about American Correspondents having inter-
viewed "the Hero, as this is the only full, true, and parlicular
account.
This Gay Marquis is back to Villtjm again. Swagger a bit, and put
on "side iu the streets of the gay Versailles. The Hereditary Grand
owes me a fiver. Will you discount the same for
Your Own,
Dykgwell.
P.S. I mentioned my affaire de coeur, didn't IP No go. Rather
too much " side " on. Lei other lips and other hearts their tales of
love, et ceterr. Not me, Gkorge.

THE PHILOSOPHER'S JOY.
With daily pleasure I peruse
The movements of the rich and great,
Conning the fashionable news,
Which to my betters doth relate.
A certain sense of mild delight,
As runs mine eye the column down,
The gentle names of them excite,
Arriving in, or leaving town.
Myself I fancy in the place
Of one of those, the Social Best,
And O, I think, were that my esse,
How thoroughly should I be blest!
O heaven, to have, on income sure,
A handsome Income-tax to pay,
A house above my head secure,
And three meals certain every day!
To be in decent garb arrayed,
And keep a hospitable board,
Yet never feel a bit afraid,
'Twas more than Prudence would afford.
O rapture, to bestride a steed,
Or in a carriage to recline,
And think "This is my horse indeed—
Ha, ha! this vehicle is mine!"
Now, by imagining all this,
I cease awhile with care to groan,
And do enjoy another's bliss
By making it appear my own.
It is a precious gift to be
Endowed with a benignant mind,
Which happy always renders me,
Happy when I behold my kind.
"Bella, horrida Bella!"
The Spanish Cortes indulged itself with a remarkable
row on the day Prince Amadeus was elected King.
The President Zorrilla broke two silver bells in his
efforts to ring down the rioters, and then sent for a huge
brass bell with which members are summoned to divisions.
Armed with this portentous weapon, he stunned the mal-
contents. Imagine the Speaker of the House of Commons
raging like an angry dustman and ringing wildly for order,
and then sending for Big Ben.
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
At the Vaudeville.—The character of Elizabeth— not the Princess
of Axe and Crown, but the " Good" Queen Bess as drawn by Froude,
Lingard, andMiss Strickland—is a fair subject for burlesque. The
skittish Queen who drank old ale, called her courtiers nicknames,
boxed the ears of the Earl of Essex, struck her waiting ladies, and
danced and flirted at the age of fifty,'.could find no representative of
her own sex on the staire, and falls, therefore, fitly into the hands of
Mr. Thorne. The Whiskerandos of Mr. James belongs, as it
did in Sheridan's Critic, only to burlesque, and he is immensely
funny. The Lord High Admiral, Sir Francis Drake, has a marvellous
make-up, and in this part Mr. Honey makes good use of his "pro-
found bass." The piece has been written partly in prose, partly in
rhyming couplets, and partly in blank verse. the author's intention
being to break through the arbitrary rule which had hitherto compelled
the writer of burlesque to fetter himself with jingling couplets. The
first attempt of this kind was made in the Frightful Heir at the Hay-
market, and followed up by the Princess at the Olympic. By the way,
actresses who undertake burlesque parts, would do well to take a
lesson from Miss Newton's performance of Sir Waller Raleigh; it is
played by using her head, and not her legs only. The part-song,
Down in the Valley" is admirably sung, and is deservedly encored.
It is a pity that English taste will not support opera bostffe; Elizabeth
would have offered an excellent opportunity for an Offenbachian piece.
Perhaps, as the melodramatic ruffian observes, "A time will come"
—and exit.
Olympic—The Old Curiosity Shop does not lend itself to dramatic
treatment. Little Nell and her Old Grandfather are, in the story,
perpetually living in a vale of tears, and the Child, like Master Paul
Dombey, seems to have been killed because she was getting troublesome
as she grew up and got older.
Granting this, Little Nell is perhaps about as well dramatised as it
could be, and is certainly in capital hands, that is, as regards the lead-
ing personages in the dramr. Mr. Belmore's Old Grandfather is, we
venture to say, Dickens's conception to the life, and the same remark
applies to the Quilp of Mr. Clarke, than whom no one on the stage
could play it better. His Quilp is an awful little demon, a snarling,
wicked, cruel, ugly lump of detormily: add but a heavy supper after
the play, and if Quilp doesn't haunt your perturbed sleep then never
again trust the nightmare powers of a Lobster salad.
Miss Florence Terrt has made her first appearance here in the by
no means easy role of Little Nell. She is very promising.

STRAWBERRY LEAVES.
A SELECTION FROM THE VERY LATEST LETTERS OP THE HONOURABLE
HORACE WALPOLE, OP STRAWBERRY HILL. FAVOURED Bt OUR
PRIVATE SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
To Sir Horace Mann.
You ask for news, my good Sir. What news should there He P I
can send you a bagatelle or so. I can just inform you that England is
ruined, that we are going to war with Russia, America, and half-a-
dozen other powerful and well-armed nations, against whom we shall
oppose an Army that would rather crowd my hlue-room, and a Navy
that would not seriously incommode the gold-fish in my pond. Shall L
give you oil months to see England a province, or shall I haggle for
eight P It is not worth wrangle. The interesting question is whose
slaves we are to be. Will Mr. Gladstone he left in office as Count
Gladstone 11', or will he be superseded in favour of the Honourable
George Frederick Train P The White Sea, or the White House, from
which shall our new ruler comeP You tell me we should not "despair
of the Republic." True; but we are not a Republic.
Meantime, though la situation ne manque pas de graviti, let us laugh,
by all means. Man is the only laughing animal—he is proud, and
snubs his poor first cousin the bysena, in spite of family likeness—and
to laugh must therefore be manly. We lack no provocation to mirth,
surely, with a savage war devastating the Continent, and another pre-
paring for ourselves. Was it Crassus who never laughed F Pooh, my
dear Sir, he lived in Pagan days, and knew not what sport meant. I
am Democritus. We live in the Christian era, when men love one
another, and show it.
What can 1 tell you, but these levities P Do you care to know that,
a King who ought to be in Rome prefers to linger outside it, and
amuse himself with an American wild-beast circus, which his Majesty
ordered, by telegraph, to await his royal coming P Also, that he had
leisure to be enchanted with a couple of lion-pups, given him by the
Yankee showman P This is the aspirant to the throne of the Cmsars— my
beautiful busts of them blushed for him, when I read out the paragraph.
O, you don't, care about Kings. Very well, but how much higher must
IgoP Will you have details from the Criminal Courts P There is
nothing there. The culprits are as stupid and unimaginative as if
they stole plays instead of spoons. Our highest Court of all is solemnly
engaged in considering whether a Brighton parson may wear a birettr.
Therefore, with bishops and archbishops and all the company of the
heavenly-minded, the Keeper of the Conscience is fitting to sentence
Geoffrey Muffiucap for putting on his cap in church. Since my dear
old Palmerston's story of the great engineer who erected a steam-
engine to draw the cork of a ginger-beer bottle, snre nothing has been
so droll. Yes, there is something droller. None of them see it
Oculoi habent et—so forth. But you ask me what is a biretta?
Alas! I never saw one. But 'tis thought to be a hatter's translation of
nimbus. Are you wiser P
A good Utile bird told me that sundry native and imported dukes,
and the like, were coming to see me on Tuesday; so I left Margaret's
ghost in charge, and flew to Brighton. The first person I met was my
Butcher, the second my Baker, and the third my Candlestick-maker.
However, they were better than the home-grown and exotic dukes.
I saw many handsome faces, at least as much of them as the owners
did not conceal with punt, (which is, you must know, their way of
being modest), but L would not be presented, though several dowagers
were ready to be hailed. At sixty, one cannot pay compliments, or if
one does, it is at one's peril. W hen saying pretty things, stop, if you
hear yourself laughing at yourself—it is an echo.
As they have not water enough to be seen for nothing at Brighton,
they are making an Aquarium, where they will pay to sea water with
every kind of sea-beast in it. I submitted a motto for it from Uudibras—
"For as on earth there is no beast
But in oorae tish in sea's expressed,
So in the wicked thrre's no vice
Of which the saints have not a spice."
But it failed to please. Butler is not witty enough for the present
generation, whose divine mirth loves blacking on the face and slang on
the lip. Butler, however, need not pout, in Elysium. Othello has no
chance now unless he be really the t luck lips, and sing Yankee tunes.
You and I, my dear Sir, remember when thoughtful acting, and judi-
cious delivery of splendid poetry, would fill a playhouse. But, do not
say this aloud, or you will be called ^laudator temporis acti. It is safer
to smile with fools than at them.
Bless the newspapers for one thing! they state the weather every
day. To be sure this is a heartless and wholesale robbery of a Briton's
conversational stock, but Master Dishonesty is in fashion now, and walks
in new silver slippers presented by the Emperor of the Russia*. More-
over, I know nothing about ttie weather, except, that I refuse to recog-
nise it. The Sun (if there be one still in the firmament) can play no
tricks with me. I have yellow glass windows which extort sunshine as
easily as our rulers extort Income-tax; and whether he looks coldly
on me or not, I care not; my private sun comes frcm Newcastle. But
I suppose there is weather, and that it is execrable and unwholesome;
for whenever I look out I see doctors galloping over the country, seek-
ing whom they can hinder from getting well, aud smiling their tHanks
to the unbenignant skies. Thank you. we have no sickness, except
that daily produced by reading the murders committed by Kings and
Generals, and that I cure with a dose of Dante's first volume, varied at
times with a certain Vision of Don Quevedo, who went down and saw
all the Kings.
Adore my happy quotation! It comes into use again after eighty
years. There was a certain young lady who was particularly desirous to
wed the son of the Dues of Ahgtit.. and in my letter to the delightful
Miss Humus, on the 2nd June, 1791, I called her "the Maiden all
For-Liirn." I perceive that, our friend Punch has been much afflicted
with this jest lately, but I acquit any one who sent it him of knowing
much about me or my writings.
1 make no rash promises of correspondence. I leave such things to
young school girls, who are not responsible creatures. But if anything
worth telling occurs—if there is a fall of thrones, stocks, or meteor-
stones, you may expect to hear from Your devoted,
Horace Walpole.
AN UNLUCKY APPOINTMENT.
unch, my bosom
friend and confi-
dential adviser, I
did congratulate
you, seven days
ago, on your es-
cape from the
"Battle of Ba-
con"— when lo!
the ink was
hardly dry before
the election of
Colonel Hogg
to the Chair-
manship of the
Metrop o 1 itan
Board of Works
made me tremble
again for your
safety. I fear
you must have suffered this time. It is hoping against hope to sup-
pose that any punster could withstaud the temptation offered by the
new Chairman's provoking name. Iudeed, I feel sure that long before
this note of condolence brings its comfort, you and the letter-carrier
of the district in which your official residence is situated must have said
very hard things of the hour iu which the Board, too regardless of the
comfort of others, made such a faial choice.
Has not the iuksbed been enormous P You will, of course, give
statistics. I am glad that it is not hot weather. How earnestly you
must hope that the Chairman of the new School Board for London
will not have a name upon which j ikes can be founded! Meanwhile,
sustain yourself in this season of trial and suspense with the reflection
that there is one who feels for you in your sympathising
Growler.

"in- - Iw Luton Magistrates.
«' They bad," he ob-
serves, "their moral cesspool to empty," and they emptied it into
the Army. Rubbish, the General thinks, most not be shot there.
Unhappily he is right. An Army, such as the British, must needs be
composed of valuable materials. Alas, that they should be liable to be
shot, and not the rubbish. But so it is. We cannot depend upon an
army of blackguards in these days. Long ago, indeed, a great Com-
mander told his Commonwealth that, for soldiers, "we want men who
have a conscience of what they do. Now, more than ever, do we
need the salt and not the scam of the earth to fight our battles—the
battles forced upon us by foreign burglars and garotters in the whole-
sale line. But, O what a pity this is, and what a bore! How grievous it
seems that we cannot put our scoundrels to use by employing them in
the hardest work that has to be done. Military active service is often-
times more painful than penal servitude. If any member of the com-
munity must needs suffer the torments which have to be endured by
wounded soldiers, who should they be but the criminal classes?
Who but they are the proper persons to undergo the severest hard-
ships and privations that any man can, and some must P If there must
be food for powder, of whom ought it to consist but brutes who
are good for nothing else P The impossibility of making them avail-
able for that material seems to be an anomaly in the nature of things.
Why is convict labour inadequate to military service P Is it, possibly,
because war is an evil avoidable by wise and just counsels: a .calamity
which people always owe to cither their fault or their folly r
War would have some visible use, like that of thunderstorms which
clear the air, if belligerent nations could use up their rogues and
ruffians by setting them to light together. In that case some appro-
Sriate alterations could be satisfactorily made in military nomenclature.
iegiments, brigades, and battalions might be named after rascals of
special kinds. The British Army might then have its larceniers; for
example, its horse and sheep stealers, its footpads, its light and heavy
felonry, and so on. If it were but practicable to reorganise our Army
on the basis of the regimental system above indicated, war would in
some mtasure be a blessing, it would enable us to utilise our moral
sewage according to the deserts thereof, by disposing of it on the field
of battle.

Mrs. Hen. When do you mean to pay me that £10 P
Hen. What £10 P
Mrs. Hen. Why, that £10 you borrowed of me to help pay 'your
tailor's bill. 1 've got your note of hand for it.
Ben. But that was last Christmas.
Mrs. Hen. Very well
.
Hen. 1 don't owe it you now, then. It's barred by the Statute of
Limitations.
Mrs. Hen. Fiddle-de-dee! The Statute of Limitations is six years.
Hen. Appoints six years, dear. A statute is one thing, and a term
of years is another.
Mrs. Hen. You know what I mean, very well.
Hen. What I mean you don't perhaps know.
Mrs. Uen. What do you mean P
Hen. To me last Christmas seems full six years ago. Every month
has been at least a year morally.
Mrs. Hen. Yah! Morally. When you refuse to pay your jnst debts.
Talk of morality—you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I'll tell you
what—if you don't pay the money, principal and interest, by to-morrow
morning, I shall instruct my solicitor to proceed against you in the
County Court. So there!
Hen. 'Pom my word, I haven't the money by me just now. But
there's an instalment (offers a coin).
Mrs. Hen. That, indeed! Stop, though. Give it me (snatches it away
from Am). A shilling (rings it on the table), "its a bad one. You false

Mrs. Hen. On your walking-stick. On your gun. On your cigars.

Mrs. Hen. Post! You know tout own value, then.
Hen. Talking of post, come—Uncle John's little property is settled
on me—I'1l give you a post-obit.
Mrs. Hen. Your Uncle John may live these dozen years—I want my
money now.
Hen. What for P
Mrs. Hen. What's that to you? Now women have got their rights
—that is, a few of them—they are not going to allow their husbands to
pry into their circumstances and what they are going to do with their
property.
Hen. No, dearest; but it may be the privilege of a fond consort to
i make a suggestion, and to offer disinterested advice. With regard to
that little sum of £10,1 acknowledge the debt. 1 have been joking.
It was foolish of me; bat never mind—1 will write you a cheque at
once for the £10 if you like; but you can do better than take that.
Suppose you convert the debt into an investment P
Mrs. Hen. In what way P
Hen. Let the money remain in my hands, on legal security, bearing
interest. I will give you 5 per cent.
Mrs. Hen. What's the security P
Hen. Freehold. The little garden attached to this cottage is my
own. Your security, love, shall be a part of the land. You shall have
a mortgage on its most productive portion; the asparagus bed.
Mrs. Hen. Can I trust you P
Hen. Don't ask me. Consult your solicitor. Ten pounds at five
per cent, will be ten shillings a year, a nice little sum for pocket-
money, and there will be the principal in case anything should happen
to me, to be realised if you want it; anyhow a nice little provision for
the future.
Mrs. Hen. You are sure you will pay me the interest punctually P
Hen. Will I pay my rates and taxes P To be sure. And if 1 don't,
then you can foreclose.
Mrs. Hen. Four what P Clothes! How do you mean P
Hen, Oh, ho! (laughing) your lawyer will tell you all about that. I
should mention one thing: you know 1 shall be able to pay off the £10
at any time if [ like.
Mrs. Htn. O yes.
Hen. But then, of course, you would cease to receive interest.
Mrs. Hen. H'm!
Hen. There, never mind. I shall be quite willing to do what you
like, for that matter. So perhaps you might find it convenient to put
another £10 to the investment, and make it twenty, and 1 can mortgage
you the cabbage-bed as well . Eh P
Mrs. Hen. 1 hardly know what to say.
Hen. Say yes, Kezzy, as you spoke that word once, when (his voice
falters)—when (mentally, aside) you answered a fool according to his folly.
Mrs. Hen. Very well, then, yes if you like.
Hen. Once again Affection answers in the affirmative, and I am a
happy man. Do you happen to have a ten-pound note about youf
Mrs. Hen. (producing a pwtemonnaie). I think 1 have. Yes (pulls out
a bank note). Here. (He offers to take it.) Not so fast. Wait till the
mortgage deed is drawn up, duckey.
Hen. Goosey, rather. 1 ought to have known I was dealing with a
woman of business, i '11 give you another note of hand (miles) for the
money meanwhile. There (handing acknowledgment).
Mrs. Hen. And there (she gives him the bank note).
Hen. That is all right. Let the necessary legal documents be pre-
pared as soon as pnssihle; in the meantime permit me to seal our little
contract—so (kissing her). A good husband requires no statute to
compel him to respect the rights of women.

JOHN BULL'S MIND ON THE MATTER.
I don't want to fight, bat I 'U fight if I mast;
And I mast, if to fight is my duty.
And my duty, just now, is my veto to thrust—'
Fist, if need be,—'twixt Bear and his booty.
Froude, Freeman, and Mill, may all argue their fill,
That to fight in this quarrel is frantic;
That all I shall get by't in Europe's ill-will,
And a back-trip from o'er the Atlantic.
Though the gains of upholding pledged faith be but far gains,
The loss, purse and personal, nigh,
Still I hold they that make can alone unmake bargains,
That what sev'n tied one cannot untie.

And if, after that, he make free with the Turk,

I have counted the cist, and I know 'twill be heavy,
With a muddle I'm safe to begin;
I've an army to organise after I levy,
And the piper to pay, lose or win!
Bat there are things more costly than going'to war,
And sach are good faith and fair fame;
And there's one loss than all war can bring worse by* far—
That'» to lose caste, and not feel it shame.
In Geisft strength Matthew Arnold may dab me Philistine,

War is waste; it is peace to my mill that brings grist in:

But a treaty's a treaty for all who set hands to't:
And while Turkey fears Bear's sadden spring,
As John Bull then gave his undertaking, he stands to't,
And for gage, Flings his Hat in the Ring.
JUSTICE TO THE BEAR.
It is surely to the credit of England, that at a time when the Bear
is about the most unpopular of animals with us, the strong arm of the
law is stretched out to protect him. At Kingston, the other day, two
Germans who had been torturing a poor old blind bear in order to
"amuse" sundry spectators, were seized on a warrant by the autho-
rities, and the Mayor, Mr. Hardman, inflicted a heavy fine upon the
wretches. We wish that he could have given them a flogging as
well, if only for the defence they had the impudence to set up.
"There is no law against ill-treating a ferocious animal." This poor
old bear was not ferocious at all, bat if he had been, he would have
been rendered so by a cruelly short chain and brutal beating. Mr.
Punch fears that there is a great deal of this kind of thing going on in
low-class provincial shows, and he hereby encourages the police to
hunt up such cases, and hunt down the malefactors; and he further
encourages all Magistrates before whom the culprits may be brought to
imitate the Kingston example. It is bad enough to import a poor
beast, and keep him, ill-fed in a narrow " den of little ease," without
torturing him that his yells may entertain a gang of animals much
inferior to himself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

NEIGHBOURLY NOTIONS-
what a blessed pririlege
is that of knowing what
oar dear foreign friends
and neighbours are ac-
customed to say about
us! Perpend these
extracts from certain
"Notes from France"
in the Post:—
"In the first place there
is no doubt about tbe
people of France feeling
'*" intensely satisfied at the
prospeot of England being
dragged into a war, which
the language of Loud
Gkanviu.K, in their esti-
mation, renders highly
probable. It will, they exclaim, estrange England from Prussia, and oblige England to
approach France Other papers are very practical in their observations. They say,
'if England wants to save France to assist her in fighting Russia, let her take a serious
resolution, and land at any of our ports a considerable number of artillery guns, munitions,
and 100,000 men. In six weeks there would not be a Prussian in France.'"
More probably a great deal there would not be an Englishman. Our little con-
tingent would, in six weeks' time, have been annihilated. This would be a
hopeful way, indeed, for a commencement, of going to war with Russia, The old
English doggerel saw used to say:—
"If that you will France win,
Then with Scotland first begin."
If we were to take French advice, we might adapt the ancient rhyme to present
circumstances, somewhat thus:—
"If you mean to vanquish Russia,
First plunge into war with Prussis."
In continuation of the foregoing "Notes" we are told that:—
"You do not meet with a Frenchman who, when speaking of the somewhat insulting
attitude of Russia towards England in her despatches concerning the revision of the Treaty,
fails to exclaim, ' (Test bienfait V"
And the Note-writer adds:—
"This is very natural; if not benevolent, it is human nature, wicked human nature."
Foreign nature. rather—wicked foreign nature. No doubt it is natural enough
for the average Frenchman to rejoice in the prospect that we English, hating war
as we do the Author of war, shall be obliged to engage in it against our will. It
is natural for the Frenchman as a foreigner. But, if natural of him as a foreigner,
it is, just now, rather stupid of him as a Frenchman. If we are to go to war
with Russia, that undertaking will be business amply sufficient to engross all our
attention. We shall have quite enough to do to mind our own business, and shall
certainly not concern ourselves, if we can help it, with that of anybody else.
France will not be the battle-ground on which we shall send troops to fight the
Prussians when as many soldiers as we can spare will be wanted to fight the
Russians elsewhere, and most likely to defend Canada against our kind American
cousins. We shall be much too busily engaged even to take any opportunity
which may present itself of trying to negotiate a peace between France and
Germany. Our excellent French well-wishers, who say c'est bien fait that Russia
has insulted us, will perhaps, on consideration, discern that, on the contrary, c'est
mal fail as regards its likelihood to conduce to our giving them any assistance.
A DRAMATIC WARNING.
Garotters belong to a class of persons mostly destitute of education. Some
of that class, however, capable of reading, may be impressed with a salutary admo-
nition by the announcement, in the playbills of the Royalty Theatre, of Mr.
Reecr's new "civic" burlesque, entitled Whittington Junior and his Sensation
Cat. The passing ruffian, able to make those words out, will very probably be
reminded by them that he had better not commit robbery attended with violence,
because, should he be convicted of that crime, he will have to experience the
sensations excited by the instrumentality of that most disagreeable Sensation Cat,
the Cat-o'-niue-tails.
To Correspondents.
PrjscH really does not undertake to answer questions which may be solved
with the aid of a shilling dictionary. But having taken the trouble to say this,
he may as well add for the benefit of the " group of gentlemen," that the word is
spelt neither "Kerb," "Cerb," " Curb," nor "Kirb," but Kurb, though it is derived
from the Latin Curbum, an edging, which is again derived from the Syriac "Coor-
"used two or three times by Herodotus in his famous account of the
Mysteries of Udolpho.

WHAT PRIDE SWALLOWS.
Horses, donkeys, dogs, and oats,
Think of eating; mice and rats!
80 in Paris people do,
By vainglory brought thereto.
Frenchmen may by choice eat frogs—
Eat, for hunger, cats and dogs:
Horse and donkey, may deem nice,
But can't relish rats and mice.
Fancy bow-wow, fancy mew,
In your curry or your stew;
Or salmi you could bespeak
By the name of bubble-and-squeak!
O the pleasures of a siege,
Come of warring for "prestige!"
Never to devouring rat
Let us be reduced by that.
Donkey for Sinner.
If horse is good to eat, donkey is twice as good. An
ass in Paris sells for 600 francs; a horse fetches no more
than 300 francs. Donkey is accounted a delicacy by the
besieged Parisians; they call it dne, and it eats like veal.
Thus at least says a voyager from Paris by way of balloon.
The similitude of the taste of donkey to that of veal is
remarkable when that fact is considered in connection
with the circumstance that, in a psychological sense, Calf
and Ass, as applied to a certain kind of person, are con-
vertible terms.

"Extensive Show-rooms for Costumes and Mantles."

evening, in the dusk, mistook the first word in this notice
in a draper's shop window, and read it "expensive." It
was not a very extraordinary mistake to make.

CIGARETTE PAPERS.
No. IV.—MY AUNTS GREAT POLICE CASK
Mr. Sharplt I notice has a quick eye and a surprised head of
hair, which gives one the idea of his having been interrupted in the
process of being brushed by machinery.
He has a sharp, crisp manner, and is evidently inclined to be what
people call " short" with everyone present—specially the Clerk and the
Solicitors.
He stands np with the air of a man who is not to be badgered or
put down, and places his hands on the table-desk in such a springy
and elastic way as to suggest, that, on the slightest provocation, he will
vault over, dash in among the papers and inkstands on the Solicitors'
table, " scatter his enemies, and make them fall."
Everybody's breath is quite taken away by his sudden and unex-
pected appearance.
While animation, as it were, is being restored, Mr. Sharplt ob-
serves, rapidly, " Gentlemen, I regret the accident that brings me here.
I have a great deal of business in the other Court which I haven't got
through, and to which I must return. Therefore, I am sure I may rely
upon you, Gentlemen, to assist in pushing on the business here as
quickly as possible. Now, what is it P"
This sudden interrogation is addressed to a Solicitor who has risen
in front of the Magistrate.
The) Solicitor will not, he says, detain the Magistrate one second
longer than he can help
Here Mr. Sharplt cuts him short with, " Well, well, what is it P
What's the case t"

some papers, and Mr. Sharplt, who has been leaning forwrrd on his
elbows, as if to give him every attention, sets himself ty'lt upright
again, as if determined to do nothing of the sort.
The Solicitor continues, "It arises, Sir, out of an ejectment
This word sets Mr. Sharplt off.
"We really haven't any time for this. It must go to
Court. What's the next case P"
A Wavering Policeman, whose duty it is to call in the next
looks from the Solicitor to the Magistrate, helplessly.
The Solicitor persists. "An assault, Sir, arising out of an eject-
ment." The word "assault" catches Mr. Sharply's ear, and (after
evidently muttering to himself, "Hang the assault!" or something
stronger) he says, petulantly, " Well, where is he P"
"HeP" says the Solicitor, astonished.
"Yes," repeats the Magistrate, "where is he—the complainant P
Now, my dear Sir, do make haste!"
The Solicitor explains that the complainant is a " she."
"Well," says the irascible Mr. Sharplt, in a tone that means any-
thing but " well"—" Where is she P Do get on." And here he looks
at his watch.
Mrs. Some hod y is thereupon called, and comes into the witness-box.
She is rather vague, to commence with, on the subject of her name,
but having succeeded in making the Clerk understand it (Mr. Sharplt,
to expedite matters, positively invents a name, which the complainant
repudiates), she waits to be asked a question.
The Solicitor commences—" You were, I believe, in"
"Now," interrupts Mr. Sharply, "Do let her tell her own story!
We must get on."
This, however, turns out to be about the worst way of " getting on"
that could have been hit upon, as the complainant's story is chiefly about
what Somebody else said (which the Magistrate won't hear), and what
she told Somebody else to tell to a third person, not present (which the
Magistrate won't receive as evidence).
"I really can't listen to this," says Mr. Sharplt, frowning at the
Solicitor, as much as to say " You ought to know better." Then, to
the Policeman, " Call the next case."
The unfortunate complainant leaves the box, and disappears, utterly
bewildered. The Wavering Policeman is about to call the next case,

when it, as it seems, calls itself, for a short man advances between the
dock and the Solicitors' bench with a bag full of papers, and addresses
his Worship.
The Magistrate places himself on his elbows, and bends towards him
with both hands up to his ears.
"Now then, Sir," he says, as briskly as ever (always on a sort of
"one down, t'other come on" principle), " Who are jou P What do
you want P Go on, Sir."
The Gentleman with the Bag commences. It appears that he wants
a great deal. It also appears that he has been before that Court several
times before, and has an application to make. The word "applica-
tion " settles his business at once.
"I really can't take up the public time," says Mr. Sharply (meaning
hit own time) "with applications. Stand down, Sir/'
But the Man with a Bag hasn't come there to stand down. He in-
sists upon the Magistrate bearing him.
"A case, Sir," the Man with the Bag goes on, while Mr. Sharply
stands aghast at his perseverance, and looks round the Court at the
people and police with the kind of air with which Henry must have
said of Thomas-a-Beckrt, " Have I no one who will rid me of this
utter boreP" I think the Wavering Policeman has some passing
idea of removing the Man with a Bag, but he can't make np his mind to
any decisive step.
The man proceeds—" A case, Sir, has arisen out of a matter of tres-
pass "Mr. Sharply frowns, and resumes his attitude of attention,
as much as to intimate that he'1l give him a chance, and just see what
he's driving at—" of trespass, which is of great immediate interest to
the persons concerned, and to the public in general"—movement of
impatience on the part of Mr. Sharply—"and I should say that in
this case"—Mr. Sharply refers to his watch—" I am the complainant
and the solicitor." Mr. Sharply all attention again. Man with Bag
contiaues, evidently aware that the thread of his discourse may be
snipped at any moment—"The ground landlord of Number Two,

vious to his bankruptcy, and "—here he warms with his subject, and
addresses the Magistrate forcibly—" on the second of June in the year

O, I can't listen to this," says Mr. Sharply, shaking his head.
"Call the next case."
"But, Sir." says the Man with the Bag, appealingly. Mr. Sharply
is down on bim. "Don't bawl at me. Sir. Good gracious! is it to
be a question whether yon are to be heard, or IP No, Sir," seeing
the man beginning again, "I won't have it. Go away, Sir. Here!
(to Wavering Policeman.) "Remove that person. Now, call the next

The "person" doesn't wait to be removed, but removes himself, bag
and all, and retires, explaining his case to the Wavering Policeman,
who evidently does his best to comfort him, without committing himself
to any view which may compromise him in his official character.
A vagrant, all dirt, rags, and tatters, has stepped into the dock.
"Poor fellow!" says my Aunt; the first words she has uttered since
the advent of Mr. Sharply, who has utterly staggered her.
A Policeman is in the witness-box, and takes his oath on a Testament
with the greatest ease.
"Now, then," says Mr. Sharply.
The Policeman deposes that he was on duty, See., &c., and saw, &c.,
&c., and warned, &c., &c. And it all rolls off his tongue as pleasantly
as possible, and the Vagrant is asked if he has anything to say to Mr.
Sharply on the subject; and it appearing that the Vagrant has nothing
to say to him, after giving him one second to think it over, he (Mr.
Sharply) has something to say to the Vagrant, which is, that he is
committed for a month with hard labour; and this being all done,
settled, and dismissed at high-steam pressure, the Vagrant is taken
away by a Policeman, and justice being satisfied, Mr. Sharply darts a
look at his watch, and calls for "the next case.
We have all along been expecting that ours is the next case, and my
Aunt is in a frightfully nervous state, and very pale. The Rum Lady
too, is becoming excited, and has her eye still fixed on " that Porkiss.'"
OUR CALCULATING GIRLS.
r/CH has been said 'about the great
cleverness of certain calculating boys,
but we have met with many girls, who
in feats of quick arithmetic, are every
whit as wonderful. We have now the
happiness of knowing a young lady
who, within five minutes of her enter-
ing a ball-room, can calculate the cost
of every toilette present, down to the
minutest article comprised in it. So
rapid are her acts of mental mathe-
matics that we would back her, after
throwing but one glance round the
room, to enumerate the details of at
least a dozen dresses, naming the right
number of flounces on each dress, and
even of the bows of ribbon worn as
ornament. Give her a clear five
minutes' talk and she will astonish
your male mind by appraising the
costume of all the partners you have
danced with: distinguishing which
dresses are put on for the first time,
and which have seen a season's, or it
may be two years', service; and count-
ing how many yards of muslin, silk,
or satin are contained in every dress,
and what amount of lace and labour
were expended in the making. She
will calculate, moreover, bow many
times Miss Skimpie must have worn
that coral wreath, before, by way of novelty, she added the green sea-
weed to it; and how often poor Miss Hahdtjppbs had her pink skirt
turned, before, to hide its shabbiness, she sewed that cheap black crape
on it. Besides this, if you ask her, she will calculate the sum that
Mrs. Skynplynt pays per annum to get her daughters' gloves cleaned;
and she will count up what Miss Crojsus (to whom you were so atten-
tive that you danced twice running with her) would, at her present rate
of usage, expend annually on scents, if it were not for the fact that
her Papa (as you, of course, have heard) was a perfumer.

Dantil O'Connell used to boast that he could drive a coach and

hand at driving his Imperial carriage through a Treaty.
Circulars and Sovereigns.
A Gang of American coiners, under the name of a firm, have been
sending over from New York a number of business Circulars recom-
mending, as especially eligible for passing as genuine, a peculiar de-
scription of base sovereigns which they have manufactured. The
arrival of these Circulars concerning base Sovereigns, simultaneously
with GoRTSCHAKOFp's Circular on the part of his Sovereign, is a
remarkable coincidence.
The Now Style.
Simplicity is fast disappearing from our language. Be fine, be
grand, or you are nothing. So a writer in a weekly periodical must
think, to give this heading to his article—" New Elements of Hand-
Railing." Will he not follow it np with " New Rudiments of Spout-
ing," New Germs of Gas-piping," "New Constituents of Draining

Birds of Bad Habits.
A Correspondent of the Times states that a pair of house-martens
were observed the other day (November 19) flying about in the High
Street of Great Marlow, Bucks. These members of the Swallow
family remind one of jolly companions who won't go home till morning,
also of those who, though sober, dance, and stay dancing at balls and
evening parties up to hours equally unseasonable. They are late birds.

CHARMING MILITARY SUGGESTION.
Oman's Warfare"
is the title of the
following letter,
addressed to the
Post. It contains
a suggestion which
comes very natu-
rally from one of
the better half of
mankind:—;
"Sir,—So intense
is my interest in,
and sympathy for,
the French, that, in
spite of myself, I
keep turning in my
mind every pos-
sible and impossible
means by which
they could get the
advantage over their exacting foe. It has just occurred to me that if some
night they were to let loose upon the Prussians all the wild animals of the
Jardin des Plantes, it would spread terror and dismay among their ranks, as
well as secure a certain diminution of their number. I would suggest that
the animals should be kept with little or no food for some days previously, so
that they might be well disposed to do the State good service. This proposal
may not be exactly in accordance with the Articles of War, but these are not
times to stand upon puuctilio, and ' in love and war all stratagems are admis-
sible.' Will you kindly give this letter a place in jour journal, and thereby
much oblige a warm friend of France? M. A. C."
Of course no lady, except the kind]of one commonly called "the old
soldier," can be expected to see the practical difficulties which forbid
the trial of a wild beast's battalion for warlike purposes. No man can
wonder that "M. A.. C." overlooks the probability that the denizens
of the Jardin des Plantes, if turned loose upon the Prussians, would,
at least as soon as they got under fire, most likely turn tail and attack
their proprietors the Parisians, unless General Tsochu caused them
all to have firebrands tied to their tails, like Samson's [foxes. It can
scarcely be conceived to have occurred to her that probably the car-
nivora in the Parisian Zoological Gardens are nearly all starved by this
time, if they have not been eaten. Nor, as she is " a warm friend to
France," could her head even be imagined to have ever been entered
by the moral consideration that the "exacting foe," who is merely
seeking to exact security that the other foe, who attacked him first,
shall not again commit a breach of the peace, is not, of the two foes,
the one upon whomjt would be the rather fitting to set loose wild beasts.
But, putting these and the like oversights aside, every well-constituted
mind must see what a happy thing it would be for humanity if it were
possible that the nations who delight in war could, when they assail
those who detest it. be encountered not with men, but with savage and
ferocious brutes, like themselves—lions, tigers, bears, wolves, and
hyeenas.
There is something specifically, and therefore delightfully, feminine
in the idea of " spreading terror and dismay among" the ranks of an
army by letting lions loose upon them. For, as Bottom observes, to bring
in . . . & lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not
a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living." One quite enters into
M. A. C.'s fancy that wild lions let loose would terrify armed soldiers.
If, indeed, those soldiers were Amazons, they would be likely enough
to be sent to the right-about by a charge of such four-footed antago-
nists, and indeed by smaller quadrupeds. The gentle hearts " of the
gentler sex, we know, "do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that
creeps on floor ;" and doubtless a moderate number of mice as assail-
ants would suffice to rout a considerable force of female warriors.
PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE OF FASHION.
In Le Follefs " Fashions for December" there is a gleam of reason
resembling the faint sunlight which now and then breaks through the
masses of clouds that mantle and muffle the sky these dark mornings:—
"Elderly ladies can never appropriate toilettes suitable only to youth with-
out adding to their age, to a degree of which it would be almost impossible to
convince them; and vice reriu, young unmarried ladies, dressed in matronly
robes and ornaments, lose the charm of elegant simplicity so becoming to
them, and show a lamentable ignorance of the first and most immutable
canon of good taste—suitability."
There'is an intelligence in this remark really amounting to common
sense, and there is a feeling of art quite sufficiently high to discern at
least one of its rudimentary principles. We only hope that the above-
quoted passage from the Folltt is not very muoh above the comprehen-
sion of most of its readers.
A EHYME FOE THE TIME.
(J la Mill, if not a la Bull )
Why shouldn't Gortschakoff
Treaties a tort shake off,
Ships from Turks' ports take off,
With Black Sea forts make offf
Pray think, Odo Russell,
If it came to a tussle.
With the Buss and the Pruss all.
And, to boot, Yankee " muss " all,
It might go with us ill.
Safe John Bull would nuzzle,
Stick to shop, gain, and guzzle.
And eschew broil and bustle.
And let Turkey turn Buss all,
E'er, muzzle to muzzle,
Ahout a cramp puzzle
Of Gentium Jus he 'II
Face Bear's hug and hustle
And Bismarck's war-muscle!
Shall Granville fire Gladsionr
To challenge, in lad's tone,
Aud talk in mad rad's tone.
Of flinging war's sad stone,
If the Czar take his dad's tone P
Prithee, Gladstone, check Granville,
While Bull on his anvil,
Swords and rifles, by vanful.
To ploughshares beats, manful.
Of the Old British Lion
The Young one's no scion;
The main chance he's an eye on,
And himself can't rely on
The foe's throat to fly on;
And the field he'd once die on,
He now would fight shy on.
So do stave off a tussle—
O do, Odo Bussell!
MELODY AND MEMORY.
Harmonious Mr. Punch,
You, who remember everything, need hardly be reminded
that Beethoven was born a hundred years ago; and I fancy you can
estimate the blessings he conferred on musical humanity, if you reflect
that in the century elapsed since he was born scarce a note of all his
music has descended to the barrel-organs. Surely, it is fitting to pay
homage to such genius, even though we, some of us, lack knowledge
to appreciate it. And the way to gain that knowledge is the way to
do him homage, namely, to go and hear, as often as we can, what his
music has to say to us. Depend on it, if we have brains to back our
hearing, we shall not listen long without profit from the pastime.
Don't think me a bore, then, if I take up some few inches of your
valuable space in telling half the Universe—1 mean to say your readers—
that Beethoven may be heard now, in this his first centenary, played
to perfection, weekly, by the Crystal Palace band, and at the Monday
Pops" by charming Ararella Goddard. Not an omnibus in London
has a cleverer conductor than Herr Manns, the Crystal Chief; and
not a church in London gives us better music weekly than Mr. Arthur
Chappell. This is no puff, but a fact: and so believe me yours in
earnest, although I write jokingly, One who Plays.
Forthcoming New Work.

WAE NEWS.
(From our own Cockalorum.)
Drarest Cockalorum,
In these excited times don't go a trusting nobody but
our own Professor of Real English. He's all there when the
ell rings. Depend upon him for being in the front which ever
way the army's going. This gay Marquis don't quite so much take
to the looks of things as he used to did. In the midst of
victorious unfriendlies all over the shop, you won't find this Light-
hearted Soldier much about. No, not me George. I've packed
up everything but a tooth-brush, as General Napier observed,
and shan't stop to say ,'good-bye to Hereditary Grands, if shuffle's
the word.
Meeting a young man who's here for the Journalistic King, he
remarked to this gallant Marquis that "times is changing." To which,
I observed, that "it wasn't all cream just now." We wunk at.each
other, smole, and said Adoo. Which it were.
This Gay Cavalier was having a chat with old Villum and The Here-
ditary Grand, and says old Villum, "if I catch that filibustering
humbug, Gariraldi, hang me if 1 don't hang him. Why didn't they
keep him in Caprera, and let him write novels for the English people P
"Yours to command," says this Sprightly Militaire, agreeing with S weet
Villum, every word of it. An American gent, here, observes
that Gariraldi can't go to America, as they're "after him"
there, he having set up a store somewhere, himself and partner
(Garir. & Co.), let in the Yanks and bolted. Not such a fool as he
looks. But then this Light-hearted Soldier is neutral tint, and loves
'em all. Which he do.
_ Mr. Home, the Spiritualist, has been here giving us no end of rum-
ti-iddities. Your Own rather.injured that Noble Marquis's feelings by
offering him a Medium cigar.' In revenge he called up the spirit of a
deceased creditor, and this before Villum and the Hereditary, both of
whom are old enough to know better. The deceased creditor went on
rapping out particulars about this Cheery Commander's private history
until, being riled, Your Own rapped out a strong expression which
broke up the entertainment.
"Villum," says this Confidential Cockalorum, "don't you go in for
the Duke Domum business. You've been uproarious and glorious up
till now; but look out, or if you take up with spirits.I'm blessed if you
won't find the tables turned."
He laughed heartily, and an hour afterwards Your O wn was put
under arrest. This gay proceeding will rouse the British Lion. It
will serve'em right if * * *
*•••«*
It's all over, shouting and everything. The Hereditary Grand.
Bizzy, Singamaringy, and the whole oiling, have been here and
implored me to make it up.
Hereditary," says this child of Nature, "yours ever."
It was a touching spectacle; even Bizzy saying he'd never seen
such a game in all bis born days. This in German, of course. How-
ever, Your Own took the opportunity of announcing the melancholy
intelligence that he must leave them to bs present at the turning-on
point in the existence of the Marchioness of Lorne, as is to be;
and hence the preparations for moving. This cut 'em—this remark
did—right into the flwnel . There were lots of Gay Young Here-
dicaries (not Grands) trying to wire in in that direction.
The truth is that the cheerful Prooshians are horrid bustled just now.
* * * An orderly is waiting to take this to the post. So no more at
present From yours ever,
Your Own Dyngwell.
P.S. Back in Plum Pudding time-
On a Theatrical Nuisance.
Perched in a box which cost her not a sou,
Giglina chatters all the evening through,
Fidgets with opera-glass, and flowers, and shawls,
Annoys the actors, irritates the stalls.
Forgive her harmless pride—the cause is plain—
She wants us all to know she's had champagne.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF FAME AND GLORY.
The heroes of the present War have hitherto none of them been
honoured by being constituted the involuntary sponsors to boots. The
tailors, however, have taken hold of them for advertising purposes. A
weekly publication, called the Tailor and Cutter, which circulates in the
trade, has issued prints with two of its Numbers—a print of the Kino
of Prussia and the Crown Prince in one, and of Count Bismarck
and M. Jules Favre in the other, on separate leaves, for the conveni-
ence of exhibition in shop-windows. The faces are copied from photo-
graphs; the figures and their attitudes are due to the invention of an
artist by whom the expression of countenance has also been suitably
modified. The Crown Prince, in full evening costume, is repre-
sented leaning on bis right hand, supported by a table,' holding a note
in his left, bis legs being crossed with the most demonstrative air of
elation in displaying a fashionable exterior. Kino William stands by
the side of his son, habited in a splendid dressing-gown, beneath which
appear the terminations of faultless trousers, and a pair of correspond-
ing boots; his right hand rests on his hip, and his left holds a bran-
new shiny hat. Bismarck and Favre are delineated in the characters
of two jaunty and rather scampish-looking swells, in morning dress, on
the lounge. Jules Favre carries a small overcoat on one arm.
Each sports a stick, Favke's being planted on the ground, whilst
Bismarck bears his cane with the "nice conduct" of a riding-switch,
held, dangling, in the manner of an idling fop, between his fore and
middle finger. The mien and bearing of all four are. with happy inge-
nuity, made to appear those of so many thoroughly impudent cads,
who have hired themselves to act as dummies for a tailor, and, possess-
ing some sense of humour, enjoy the consciousness of being got up to
resemble the distinguished individuals whom they personate. With
the exception of the Works of Art which illustrate this periodical,
these are about the most meritorious which have been lately exhibited
in any of the shop-windows.
TEE TWO DOVES.
O Dove, that in the young Earth's day of doom,
When the Heaven's floodgates stood no longer wide,
Loosed from the Ark, a white gleam on the gloom,
With weary wing sought land above the tide—
Though long and lone thy flight, a happier quest

Thy quest was gained, the foot's-breadth of dry laud,
A patch of green above the waters grey,
Where branch to rest on, twig to pluck, might stand,
Which won, thou couldst wing back thy happy way.
But these—in vain some point, of ruth they seek,
Rising above Hate's sea of blond and fire,
Nor find one spray, green still, 'mid flood and wreck,
Of Peace's Olive, that crowned thy desire!
To Publishers.
Another instance of a mistake caused by the title of a book,
has just come to our knowledge. Alrany Yorke saw advertised
Stories for Darlings, and immediately ordered it, feeling that there
could be no more appropriate Christmas present for the young lady
who is delighted to consider herself his darling. He now finds that
the book is for "Boys and Girls," so has to look out for another,
Dora Wilverton being twenty.

STRAWBERRY LEAVES.
A SELECTION PROM THE VERY LATEST LETTEHS OF THE HONOUBABLE
HORACE WALPOLE, OP STRAWBERRY HILL. FAVOURED Br OUR
PRIVATE SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
To Sir Horace Mann.
Bless your innocence, my good Sir! So you congratulate me on
having addicted myself to tea in an evening, and are pleased to be
facetious at the idea of Mr. H. W. distinguishing himself at a tea-
party. My dear child, I forgot how long yon have been out of Eng-
land. It is in the afternoon that we, nous autres, take our tea, when
we visit ladies and acquire scandals from them. Coffee is certainly
handed round after dinner, and none but fools take it, the object of
the attention being to display the huge silver tray, which the host may
have inherited from his fathers, or picked up at his uncle's. It is an
affecting sight to behold a great big-bearded heavy officer, at one of
the afternoon symposia, fidgeting over a tea-cup, and desperately
groping therein for an idea to help out his gallant conversation. But
I forgot again; you believe in big officers. I never disturb a man's
superstitions.
We have been electing a School Board—now, don't ask me to
explain to you all about it, because I never could explain anything in
my life. 1 honour the Hibernian who stated that the way to cast a
cannon was to take a long hole and pour brass round it. We are to
have a sort of School Parliament, to vote primers and birch—no, by
the way, the latter is an aristocratic luxury, a duke's son is birched, a
cheesemonger's has a lecture read to him on self-government and his
duties to the State. London has chosen her men, and women. Two
of the latter have got in, and I do not see why they should not prove
the best members. One of them, a delightful lady, a friend of mine,
and a Doctor of Medicine, headed everybody by a terrific majority. I
scut, her this on one of our halfpenny cards, and probably you will
think the verses just worth that sum:—
"In medical language, Miss Gakeett, we 're sure,
Can by skilled 'Exhibitions' accomplish a cure:
Now, deeper 8he '11 go, and with Pinnocks and Prucians,
Teach Scholarship how to obtain Exhibitions."
I need not tell you, who know something of British fanaticism, that
there has been furious war over the selections, and that the Sects have
fought like Sinners. One very worthy old lady protested against the
Arabic numerals being taught in the Schools, having heard, as she
said, that the Arabians were some kind of Mahometans. But, being a
sound Protestant, she allowed that this was better than anything
Roman.
Do not ask me about wars, the word sickens me. I am thinking of
giving up all my newspapers, until Janus slams his door. Everything
that a civilised Deing can take an interest in is excluded for details of
the savagery. I believe a paper that would shut out all war news,
except the curtest record of the fall of a city, or of a dynasty, would be
gladly welcomed. Good Heaven, my dear Sir, does not the world go
round, with all its wonders; and are we to close eyes and ears to
everything except the chronicle of gigantic murder P However, I sup-
pose that this must be coming to an end, and I dare say musicians are
busy over a new Te Deum. A new one, indeed, is wanted—but you
do not care for my moralities—and I dare say are at this present flat on
your stomach over a big map, sticking in pins—of blue and red wax—
with the eagerness of a witch working at a charm—qua movere cereas
imagines. For shame, my dear 8ir. Surge, carnifex!
You have no children, and I have none, which is a comfort for many
reasons. Bat my non-paternity does not prevent parents from con-
sulting me about the education of their valued offspring, and you know
how grave I can be on compulsion. Lately I have been much asked
whether boys ought to be allowed to play at foot-ball. This seems a
simple query, but, my dear Sir Horace, do you know to what our
exquisite civilisation has attained P There is a game largely played at
our schools—to judge by the boys' letters, it is the final cause of educa-
tion,—and it consists in a savage scramble for a big ball. To play this
game properly, a lad furnishes himself with a thick boot, with a horribly
acute tip, sharpened, that the kick may be more brutal, and the dear
delight of our young athletes is to kick one another's shins until they
are a mass of blood and bruises. The) amiable operation is called
hacking. Cornish wrestling clowns used to be denounced as worse
than brutes for this practice some years ago, but now it is the charming
amusement of oar highly-bred young gentlemen. Its chief seat is at
Rugby. One would pity the poor, proverbially hungry Rugby boys—
perhaps, like Palamedes, they forget their hunger in a game,—but
they despise one's pity, and declare that their sport is the noblest,
manliest, refinedest, gloriousest thing in the world, and the servum
pecus echoes them. I am not a milksop, but the sight of a stalwart
young fellow kicking the shins of a child till the tears came to its
eyes, would not much delight me. I thought the process was con-
sidered almost harsh when it was employed as the only means of
successfully cross-examining a Nigger witness in the West Indies. 1
know, however, a woman who thinks nothing about her children's
legs being viciously kicked in this way, but who quite howled when I
applauded Judge Byles for ordering the cat to a garotter'8 shoulders.
Please admire Bob Lowe, though Lord Holmesdale says he is the
most hateful man in England. A sham letter, purporting to be from
some artisans, was got up, complaining that Robert, as Master of the
Mint, starved them, by refusing to coin certain silver for a Colonel
Tomline, their employer. Lowe answered that it was not his busi-
ness to buy silver which the Queen did not want, that there were
plenty of people ready to buy any amount, and that a yokel whose pig
a butcher declined to buy, did not say that the butcher starved him by
refusing to buy his pig. I fancy that 8ilver Pig will squeak in the
House one of these nights.
What you tell me about the domestic warfare between Mr. and
Mrs. X. does not surprise me. Rely upon it that the wives of men
who have always been well off are kept in much better order than the
wives of men who have had to fight their way up after marriage. In
the battle the two have been on so equal a footing that if one takes the
command afterwards, it won't be the man. To say nothing of his
memories of troubles which they have shared, and which render him
indulgent, unless he is a brute. But he who can make a settlement,
can make a row, and therefore it is seldom necessary for him to do so.
I have not any news for you—I mean the sort of news you like to
tell in the salons. You should invent it, as you want it, the foreigners
know nothing about us. Yes, you love Kings, and I suppose, Queens.
Well, Queen Emma, of the Isles of Sandwiches, is not gone ad majores,
only some kind of dowager. I believe Herj Majesty to be a very
worthy person, and I am glad she is well. I hope that her lady-of-
honour, whom I saw with her at the Royal Academy, is also well, for
so colossally beautiful a personage I never saw before or since. If the
Academicians had had a grain of my taste, they would have pre-
sented a petition begging the lady to Bit for Judith, Jael, or Proser-
pine. But perhaps they nad never heard of either, and sne certainly
would not nave come well into a scene from the Vicar of Wakefield.
That's all, but if your Countesses want news, tell them that the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury is daily drawing nearer towards Rome. It is
quite true, look at his itinerary.
Madame de Girardin says that fidelity is a luxury, for it is time lost.
I love luxury, and beg you to believe me ever,
Your faithful Servant,

regarding the natural fears of youth, ventures on a Crossman. who
will probably turn out one of the most amiable men at the Board, and
has also taken care to select a PiekCun. In Lambeth Stipe was at
the head of the poll by a great majority, so all jokes about the contest

tive, but Westminster supplies the indispensable Smith, and a very
good workman he will make.

CIGARETTE PAPERS.
NO. V.-MY ACNT'8 GREAT POLICE CASE.
However, the next case (though my Aunt'is thoroughly prepared to
jump up at a minute's notice, and, indeed, can hardly be said to be
sitting down) is that of a stout man, without collars, against a thin
man in high collars.
"Now, Sir," says Mr. Sharply, so suddenly that the stout man
looks as if he is going to have a fit, and must have his neck-tie
loosened, " what is it f
The stout man (much to the thin man's delight) seems to have some
difficulty in stating his case. Whereupon the Clerk, underneath the
desk, and therefore out of the Magistrate's eye, attempts to help him.
".You charge," says the Clerk, "Mr. Sniggs with refusing to
allow"
For one instant the Magistrate is puzzled as to the quarter from
which the voice proceeds, but it suddenly occurring to him that it is
the Clerk's,' he reaches over the desk to look at him (if he had a stick
it would be exactly like Punch with the Clown, when the latter appears
at an unexpected part of the Show), and says, wit h cutting irony, "I
don't know what may be your custom here, but 1 always conduct the
cases in my own Court myself."
'' But, Sir," says the Clerk, "I"
"I don't care, Sir. I must beg you won't interfere. Now then,
Sir." This last to the complainant.
But whatever matter the stout man might have had originally against
the thin man, the altercation has quite put it out of his head. He
looks helplessly at the Clerk, then at the Solicitors (who despise him
for not having employed one of them), then at the Policeman, and
finally at the thin man, who laughs contemptuously.
"Put that man out of Court!" says Mr. Sharply, nodding his
head angrily at the thin man in a way which quite takes the laugh out
of him, "1 won't have it," meaning the thin man's laughing. "If you
can't behave yourself, Sir, you'd better go out."
The Wavering Policeman eyes the thin man imploringly, as much as
to say, "Do mind what he says. Don't compel me to take you up."
"Now, Sir," says the Magistrate, for the third time, to the stout
complainant, "Are you going to keep us here all day P What do you
charge him with P"
I believe it to be quite a chance that the stout man, being utterly
confused and muddled, didn't answer "Burglary" on the spur of the
moment. His lips move, but he is silent.
"Stand down, Sir," says Mr. Sharply, utterly disgusted with the
man's imbecility. "Now, next case."
The stout man is led from the box in a wandering state, and is
joined by the thin man and the Wavering Policeman, who shows them
out; and on the other side of the door, I suppose, they Will forgive
one another, and weep in each other's arms.
The next case is my Aunt's.
Thomas Muddock, the Cabman, is called. He steps into the wit-
ness-box, looking very respectable, and totally unlike the drunken man
who couldn't drive my Aunt on the memorable night of her visit to my
house.
Thomas Muddock takes his oath, and tells his story. He drove
the lady from Jummin Street to Squedgely, ten miles out or town,
where he waited for her five hours, and he claims thirty-two shillings.
Which is all clear enough.
So far the Cabman has it entirely his own way. My'Aunt, has come
out of the pew, and is clutching me by the elbow. "Where shall I
go P" she asks, shaking all over.
1 am hot ana excited. I beg of her to keep cool. She is called.
The clerk says, "Henrietta! and then adds the surname.
The Magistrate only catches half, and asks, abruptly,
"Where is he P Where is Henry P Why doesn't he"
My Aunt is beckoned by the Clerk. She has heard of people " being
accommodated with a seat on the bench," and she thinks she is to go and
ait by the Magistrate, out of consideration for her sex, and tell her
plain unvarnished tale confidentially. She is shaking her head, and
explaining in dumb show to the Clerk that she doesn't see how to get
there without climbing over the Solicitors' bench, and crossing the
table, when—
"Now, then," says the Magistrate, impatiently, "where is
Henry—" he can't catch the other name—" I can't wait. We must
call the next case."
And the "next case" would have been called there and then but for
my Aunt trying to get into the dock, from which she is taken by a
policeman, who informs her that she can stand behind the Solicitors.
She has a sort of reticule on her left arm, she has given me her
parasol to hold, and she places her right hand on the back oi the
seat.
Seeing this figure before him, the Magistrate arrives at the conclu-
sion that Henry is a surname, and addresses her with—
"Now, Miss Henry, what have you got to say to this P
Up to this moment she has had a great deal to say, but it appears to
have suddenly gone from her, like King Neruchadnezzar's dream,
and she can only admit that Thomas Muddock did drive her, did wait
for her about five hours, and that she hasn't paid him.
"Why not P" asks Mr. Sharply. Then, while my Aunt is looking
piteously at me (I studiously avoid catching her eye, not wishing to
appear before 1 am absolutely required), he turns to the Cabman,
Did you agree for a certain sum for the job P"
The Cabman reflects.
"Did you, or did you not P" asks Mr. Sharply, who can't wait for
thoughts.
"Yes," says the Cabman, with such an air of uncertainty as to the
statement that Mr. Sharply eyes him distrustfully, and then wants
to know " How much P"
"Well," answers Mr. Thomas Muddock, recovering himself a little,
"the lady said fifteen shillings."
"For the job?" says Mr. Sharply, suggestively.
"For the job," replies the Cabman, not clearly seeing what the
result of his answer would be.
But," says my Aunt, now beginning to be quite at home, "I said
distinctly that he might nave to wait."
"Not five hours," says Mr. Thomas Muddock,
Mr. Sharply looks from one to the other.
"Yes," says my Aunt, "I said it might be one hour or five."
"Did you agree as to time P" asks Mr. Sharply of the Cabman.
"No," says the Cabman, "I didn't—that is—in a way—Yes."
"I don't believe a word you 're saying," ssys Mr. Sharply;
whereat my Aunt, plucking up, and addressing the Magistrate, says,
"I didn't pay him, your Worship," (she is very near saying "My
Lord"), " because when I wanted him at night he was so intoxicated
that he couldn't drive me."
Mr. Sharply looks fiercely at the Cabman, and wishes to know what
he has to say to that.
Mr. Thomas Muddock hasn't much to say to that, but he is under-
stood to deny the charge in an undertone. The Magistrate eyes him
suspiciously, and is about to make an observation when my Aunt lugs
me into it.
"Here's my nephew, Sir, a barrister, saw him; he'll tell you, Sir."
Whereat I feel that the eyes of Europe (specially, unwashed Europe)
are upon me, and become very hot and uncomfortable in consequence.
"O!" says Mr. Sharply, "there are witnesses. Now, Sir!"
to me.
The Cabman comes out of the box, and I go in. A stout Policeman
hands me a Testament, and I take my oath to what I am going to say.
I notice that, if not badgered, it is surprising how very soon one's
nervousness wears off in a witness-box, and what a strong temptation
there is to become confidential with the Magistrate or anyone who
"wishes to ask this witness a question."
"Now, Sir, tell us what happened."
I detail the facts of the Cabman's being unable to find the road, and
attempt some pathos about my fear for my Aunt's safety. Having
finished my facts, and got quite pleasant with Mr. Sharply, I should
now like to romance a little; and introduce a joke or two, just by way
of lightening the entertainment. I have a sort of latent idea that Mr.
Sharply will ask me to step into his private room, or send me, by a
policeman, an invitation to dinner that night. I fancy that with the
second bottle of port, or the first cigar, he would say, "And now, old
fellow, what was the truth about that Cabman, ehP I suppose he
really was drunk, eh P"' But this is an ideal Sharply at home, and
not Sharply the real on the bench.
This occurs to me in the few seconds that Mr. Sharply takes to
consider the case, and he interrupts my reflections with—
"What do you consider the right fare to your house P"
I answer boldly, "Eight shillings," this being rather a fancy price of
my own than what I am obliged to give when I take a cab from town
to my Cottage near a Wood, at Squedgely.
"Twelve shillings there and back, you would consider quite suffi-
cient P" asks Mr. Sharply, giving the finishing touches to the case.
Mr. Sharply decides in a rapid, off-hand manner. "You'1l" (to
my Aunt) "pay him twelve shillings. Cabman pay his own costs.
Now, then, call the next case."
I think the next case must be that of our friend the Rum Lady, as
I see the dreaded Purkiss rising to address the Magistrate as we are
leaving the Court.
I look back once, tenderly, at Mr. Sharply, with a sort of lingering
idea that he will yet send me the invitation to dinner, or, at all events,
wave his hand to me genially from the bench. Nothing of the sort.
I and my Aunt's case have gone clean out of his head, and he is telling
Mr. Purkiss " that he really can't listen to this; that he hasn't got
time for these details;" and becoming once more so irritable that even
the dreaded Purkiss will be quenched, and the Rum Lady remain
unheard.
[On mature reflection, it occurs to me that Mr. Sharply is the
right man in the right place, and his brisk method of sifting the
Wheat from the intolerable amount of Chaff, is, on the whole, bene-
ficial to the public.]

BEAUTIES OF NORTH LONDON.
(HAMP9TEAD—SUNDAY AFTERNOON.)
INSURING THE PREMISES.
I'ua hard working man, on the old-fashioned plan,
Of course 1 'in aware it 'a Philistine—
Of doing for bome wife and bairns what I can,
And for taxes and rent getting grist in:
An old-fashioned house I keep over my head,
With a moat, and a roof that stands weather.
And a shop with a pretty complete stock-in-trade,
At no little expense got together.
I'm not in the way to throw fireworks in play, _
But for neighbours on all sides I 've them as is;
So I think it's quite clear, though the policy's dear,
That it'8 worth while insuring the premises.
I 're some Manchester friends that this notion offends:
Insurance, they say, is a blunder:
Not insured, but insurers, it helps to their ends:
They thrive on their customers' plunder.
Heavy premiums you pay, year on year slips away,
Unburnt, house and shop keep their places:
While the money that should have warmed life's rainy day,
Has melted, without leaving traces:
And the more England pays, the more fires people raise,
As if one drew down t'other for Nemesis!
In short, none but donkeys—for that is their phrase—
Would think of insuring their premises.
Now I've come to the season when grey hairs weigh reason,
This Manchester school's a rare talker,
But practice to set against preaching's no treason,
And by that test my answer is " Walker!"
Though insurers be ninnies, who squander their guineas,
Still the un-insured house is a rare house;
And e'en Manchester's self, in nine streets out of ten is
Insured, mill and mansion, and warehouse.
Then I '11 do not as Manchester says, as she does;
And with fire all about— that, my premise is—
Hold no cash so well spent as the money that goes,
And shall go, in insuring my premises.
To defer it were crime in this terrible time,
When fireworks and fire are folks' crazes;
When my cool German neighbour spurns reason and rhyme,
And from books rushes wildly to blazes.
When every man over his neighbour's yard-wall
Is preparing to fling squibs and rockets;
When on gunpowder trains, laid in corners, you fall,
And find crackers alight in your pockets.
Ere my house the fire enters, escapes, fire-preventers,
All against conflagration ad rem as is,
I '11 provide at all cost; none shall call money lost
What is spent in insuring the premises.
THE FACE AND THE FLOUR-DREDGE.
Whek, in broad daylight, a fellow's eyes happen to be in the vicinity
of a young lady's face whereon the light fails, her cheek, in many
places, will present to them the appearance of a certain asperity, occa-
sioned by a white pulverulent substance extending over the skin. After
a waltz with her, on an evening, he may find his coat-collar and sleeves
whitened with a similar substance, of which he will too probably mis-
take the nature. Fellows, therefore, should know that this apparently
cutaneous efflorescence is not of an exanthematous character. It does
not arise from exfoliation of the cuticle of Beauty's cheek, and exhibits
merely the semblance of a furfuraceous and desquamatory state of
integument. So good an imitation, however, is it of that sort of thing,
as to require the eye of a medical man to distinguish it from a morbid
product. It is, however, on the contrary, a mere external application,
for which there is no necessity and for whose use there is some diffi-
culty in accounting. Vanity, one would think, could not possibly be
the motive of a self-defacement which simulates dandriff. One can
conceive why a girl wants her face to look like a peach, but what can
induoe her to give it a similitude to a mealy potato P Surely flour upon
a fair face is matter out of place. It should whiten no man's lips.
"One Small Head can carry all I know."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PASTORAL TO ME. MACKONOCHIE & CO.
From the Eastern (Central) Archimandrite Punch, greeting:
Health, Happy New Year, and a Merry Christmas to you, Gentlemen,
and Dear Brothers all.
It wounds our paternal heart to see you, Brothers, Gentlemen, and
Scholars sheltering yourselves under such paltry subterfuges as no
men of honour, not ecclesiastics, would, in their ordinary dealings with
one another, for one moment either adopt, defend, or tolerate. Gentle-
men, be honest, fearless of consequences [when you are as sure as you
can be that you are right] and be outspoken. Do not style yourselves,
or allow yourselves to be styled " Fathers," that title having been long
since dropped by the English Church, is, as genuine " wholly Romans'
will tell you, only properly applicable to what they call Religious.
Gentlemen, Gentlemen, don't humbug yourselves and your congre-
gations.
Your loving Archimandrite is for freedom of opinion everywhere, and
outside the pale of the Thirty-Nine Articles you can think and do what
you please, but you have no more locus standi aut genvflectendi in the
English Protestant Church, as by Law (by Law, Gentlemen, observe)
established, than have Drs. Manning and Newman, Mr. Spurgeon,
Mr. Bradlaugh, or any members of the Irvingite, Wesleyan, Shaker,
Quaker, or Jumping Methodists' Connexion.
And, Gentleman, you know this as well as your loving Archimandrite
does.
You are playing a game—a game dangerous to your own morality
and that of your party-spirited followers, who almost believe in your
infallibility.
You do a great deal of practical good, and are hard workers, no
doubt, among the poor; so also are the Plymouth Brethren, notably;
but, brothers, they are not paid by the Established Church as you are,
nor have they given their solemn assent to the Anglican formularies
as you have.
Ponder these words, and, if you cannot become wholly Roman or
wholly Greek, set up for yourselves, but do not remain the ecclesiastical
mermen you are at present.
Wishing well to you, brother Mack, and all other Thirty-Nine
Articled clerks, we remain
Your loving Archimandrite,
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
aymarket Thratre. Play,
"The Palace of Truth."
Club Man (who comes to
be amused). Do you know
anything about this piece P
Elderly Habitui. No, or
else I shouldn't be here.
(Quite annoyed.) I hale
knowing what a piece is
about before I come.
His Friend (exhibiting
programme). But they print
the argument in the bill.
Elderly Habitui. Hate
arguments. Have enough
of 'em at home. Don't
want 'em at the theatre.
[Consoles himself with
the remembrance (hat
he is en garfon for
the present, and sur-
veys the house through
his lorgnette.
Young Lady (to Friends
whom she has just met). Ed-
ward was here the other day,
and he said we ought to see
it, so I got Papa to come.
[She says this as'if apologising for being there.
Papr. Yes (grumpily). 1 very seldom move out now, on account of
the cold. (More cheerfully, after looking at programme) Ah! I'm
glad to see Buckstoxe's in this. [Laughs by anticipation.
Several other people having discovered that Buckstone is in it, also smile.
The Fairy Comedy commences.
Club Man (making'a discovery). Why it's an extravaganzr. (After'a
little time he alters his opinion). No, it isn't an extravaganzr.
Enter Buckstone as a King in burlesque. Mrs. Chippendale as a

Queen, something between Mrs. Siddons as L*dy Macreth and
Queen Anybody.you-like in one of the old Lyceum Extravaganzas.
Club Man (altering his opinion again). O, it is an extravaganzr.
Lounger from "the Rag." There's not much fun in it. (Yawns.)
[Club Man and Lounger begin to look upon the piece as a sort of
theatrical firework with the bang take* out.']
A surly old man, Mr. Rogers, and a cheerful old man, Mr. Braid,
holding some official positions at Court ouly to be found in the
Palaces of Extravaganza, talk a Utile; then a Prince and Prin-
cess talk a great dial.
Club Man (with some uncertainty). It's— it's blank verse, isn't it P
Lounger (listening). Yes, I think so; at least (giving his standard of
judgment) it seems to be uncommonly flat. And (arrives at this conclu-
sion after half an hour of Act I.) there are no puns.
Indignant Amateur (of thepre-Raphaelite-mtcroscopic-detail-and-recon-
dite-humour school, overhearing the above remarks). Puns! bah! why,
it's like an Arthurian potm. It's charming. So subtle. Such
delicate touches.
Charles (his Friend, who "dabbles" in studios. Simply). Yes. Nothing
vulgar.
Enter Azema, a coquette. She has nothing to do with what there is
of a plot.
Azimr. I am not modest, though I seem to be, &c., &c.
[Business, of showing her foot and ancle; she makes a few more broad
remarks, an assignation and then retires.
Male Stalls, j 61870! C»PitaI!
[Some Ladies in Private Boxes smile knowingly on one another-
Some others (and there are Ladies and Ladies) raise their fans.
Perhaps the Theatre is a trifle warm. The men chuckle. All
subside into their former decorous state on recommencement of the
stately blank verse.
High Art Amateur. Really charming.
Charles (his Friend). Yes.
High Art Amateur (speaking to a Lady). Such an utter absence of
anything like vulgarity.
Lady (avoiding the point). Yes it's very nice. Very pretty indeed.
[She says this much in the way that Sam Weller told one of the
Bath footmen that he "liked his conwersation much; il'swerry
pretty."
End of Act IT.
Elderly Habitui (thoughtfully). I should think it would be better to
read than to see acted. If it wasn't for Buckstone, it would be a
little dull.
Lounger (stretches himself). Ya-as. The girl—the coquette's not bad.
Eh P Rather French, eh P Where she
[Chuckles. His Friend chuckles. They all then chuckle. They
look round at the house through their opera-glasses, and talk
about beauty and the other theatres, and what's doing generally.
War News avoided.
Pit (going out for refreshment). I like to see Buckstone in something
as makes you die o' laughing. When I comes out 1 like to have a
good laugh. We've enough t' other way in leg'1ar every-day work
(refreshes himself).
High Art Amateur (at the conclusion of the piece, to his friend Charles,
who has ventured to observe thai he had not been quite so much amused as
he had expected). My dear fellow, this is a sort of thing over most
people's reads. (Charles is flattered.) You don't want always to be
on the broad grin. (Charles is more flattered than ever, and tries
to look philosophic.) The stage has a higher aim than merely to
excite spasmodic laughter by grinning through horse-collars.
[Feels that he has read poor Charles a severe lesson. Charles
thinks that next time he goes to the play he '11 choose a pleasant
companion. At present he does not press his High Art Com-
panion to stay, but remains himself, to thoroughly enjoy the
genuine fun of " Uncle's Will," admirably played. House in
roars. Rogers in great force. Success generally.
Club Man and Lounger (going off arm-in-arm). Capital! the Uncle's
Will! The other—1 don't know what it is— (yawns)—but think it
wanted music. Come along. [Exeunt, smoking.
Misleading.
Cattle Show1 Exhibitors are hereby cautioned against making a
journey to the British Museum, to inquire about the "Swiney Lec-
turer," his subject being Geology—not Pigs.

Imitation has been termed the truest form of flattery;
hut we doubt if many authors would feel themselves much

such, for instance, as the following:—
Swect at a Nut: a Sensation Story, written for the readers
of Bitter is the Rind.
The Mouser't Mission, a stirring Tale of Feline life: for the
amusement of those who have been pleased by The
Cat's Pilgrimage.
Pots and Proprieties: a handbook for the table; published
as a pendant to Cups and Customs.

the novel Beyond these Voices.

FOOD FOE THE FEMALE MIND.
Drarest Punch,
You know of coursethat Propessor Huxley is'delivering a
series of lectures at South Kensington for the instruction of women
in science and art, it is so kind of him, isn't it P One of these lectures
on the subject of "Physiography," was published in a newspaper, out
of which 1 clip what follows:—
"The Thames carries down to the sea not less than 14,000,000 cubic feet
of solid material, either dissolved or as mud, every year; at the present rate
of denudation the whole basin would be washed down to the sea level in
1,000,000 years, and the surface of Britain would everywhere be washed down
to a plain level with the sea in lees than 5,000,000 years,"
How awfully old the world will get, if it lasts long enough! And
what a terrible age it is of even now! Everyone who is not a very
great Stupe must be able to understand as much as that from the end
of Propessor Huxley's lecture:—
"As to the length of time which it may have taken to scoop out the basin
of the Thames, Professor Huxley supgetted that some idea might be
gathered from the fact, that two thousand years would not probably have
made more than three inches of difference on the general elevation of the
surface."
Of course so clever a man as Propessor Huxley must know all
about the Thames basin and the "{Physiography" of its contents, and
there can be no doubt that, by looking into it, and examining them, be
is able to make some calculation, as above, of the age of the Earth.
Now, therefore, poets and other writers, will have to leave off applying
to the Earth a word they are very fond of. It will not do for them to
call.it Mother Earth'any more, because although Mother may be proper
enough, meaning old, yet in that sense it makes out the Earth to be an
old Woman. Now, no woman, young or old, ever tells her age; but
the age of the Earth, up to some millions of years at least, has been
told by the Earth itself to Propessor Huxley.
How sad to think that in 5,000,000 years' time'Britain will every-
where be washed down to a plain level with the sea! It will be a very
plain level indeed. In 5,000,000 years one can well imagine Britain
will have become a plain old thing. Indeed, the wonder now is, that
Britain still preserves any beauty at all, what with the tall chimneys,
and one horrid object ana another, and some of the brick-and-mortar
spots on Britain's face, are dreadful! I wish Propessor Huxley
would direct attention to those blemishes on the "Physiography " of
Britain. His lectures are so interesting, they make one think, as yon
see from the letter, which I conclude by signing the name of
Your ever affectionate
Louisa.
P.S. I am so fond of mental food. Chocolate in't to be compared
with it for a moment. It is so nice.
STAGGERING ADVENTURES.
O Mr. Dawson Burns! O Reverend Sir I Surely you, and the
United Kingdom Alliance, and the Temperance League, must have
bf en scandalised by, if you have seen, the announcement, for pub-
lication early in December, of a new work under the disreputable
title of:—
"ZiozAOorNo Amongst Dolomites. By the Author of 'How we Spent
the Summer: or a Voyage en Zigzag in Switzerland and Tyrol.'"
How much alcoholic liquor did the party of tourists who went zig-
zagging amongst the Dolomites usually take at a sitting to make them
zigzagr What kind of liquor was it; beer, wine, spirits, of what
sorts, or a mixture of liquors of all sorts P Truly their tour, a zigzag
tour, must have resembled the tour of "Drunken Barnaet. Did no
accidents come of zigzagging in such dangerous places as the mazes
of the Dolomites P Perhaps the voyagers "en zigzag" exemplified
the adage, according to which such travellers are celestially cared for.
Let us hope their number included no ladies; for the condition
wherein people go zigzag, bad enough in a man, is unpardonable in a
woman. Wandering amongst the Dolomites, zigzag, they must now
and then have had occasion to ask the way, and then perhaps the
simple mountaineers of whom they inquired, sometimes answered, "as
straight as yon can go."

A PLEA FOR THE PIBROCH.
On the 30th of November, being St. Andrew's Day, of coarse the
friends of the Scottish Hospital Corporation celebrated their anniver-
sary festival. The baggis, and collops, and brose, and parritch, with a
variety of other creature comforts, and likewise the Farintosh and the
Glenhvat, not to mention the Chambertin, and Lafite, and Chateau
D'Yquem, were served up to the assembled brother Scots and Free-
masons at the Tavern of the latter. The MacCallum More, other-
wise called the Duke of Argill, presided, and proposed the health
of his Royal Sister-in-law that is to be with his usual felicity. The
toast of the evening was, "The Scottish Corporation," and setting
aside the banquet, we may, having a reasonable ear for music, present
the following as an account of the treat:—
"The Di ke of Arotll's piper made the circuit of the room several timet
during dinner, playing 1 The Campbells are Coming' and other appropriate
airs, in a duly boisterous and highly applauded manner. The band-boys of
the Caledonian Hospital alto roused the enthusiasm of the company by their
olever manipulation of the Scotch national instrument."
Considering the effect, which, as in the case above related, the bag-
pipe is capable of producing, a musician must wonder that at the
higher class of Concerts, we are never gratified by a performance on
that tuneful instrument. Why should it not be introduced into the
"Monday P»ps " immediately, and next season into the Philharmonic P
Suppose a Bag-pipe Oratorio, the orchestra playing the accompani-
ments to consist exclusively of bag-pipes, were produced at Exeter
Hall. It might be entitled "St. Andrew.'' Handel having appro-
priated "Judas McCabeus."
BALL-PRACTICE AND BALLOONS.
In a letter to the Times, describing his aerial voyage from Paris in a
balloon, M. de Fonvirlle relates that, in passing over the Prussians,
he was hotly fired at by them from below. "Firing," he says, "did
not prevent the balloon from continuing its way, and ascending to 3500
yards, when firing ceased." It is m ore brave than wise to fire at an
enemy's balloon. By throwing out ballast the aeronaut can soon rise
out of range. But suppose that, for ballast, he has taken up a quan-
tity of grape-shot, and, when he wants to ascend above the reach of his
foes, drops some of it on their heads. He is beyond the range of their
missiles, oat they are within that of his. and the higher he rises the
heavier his shot must come down upon them.

PUZZLING HER TRADESMEN.
The other day Mrs. Maxap&of rather astonished the Chemist with
whom she deals by asking him for some mitigated spirits of wine
(for her egg-boiler). It was some time before it dawned upon him
that she meant "methylated."

FIGHTING AT FOOT-BALL.
Surgeon" in the Timet, ani-
madverting on a practice
called "hacking," gives an
inventory of certain injuries
thereby occasioned. Whether
they were or no, it is noto-
rious that such injuries are
wont to be. He says :—
"One boy with his collar-
bone broken, another with a
severe injury to the groin, a
third with a severe injury to Mh
ankle, a fourth with a severe
injury to his knee, and two
others sent home on crutches,
ought to be sufficient to call the
attention of the Head Master to
the culpable practice of hacking;
practice which has nothing to do
with the game, but which fre-
quently injures for life, and is a
licence for a malignant grudge."
The Head Master above referred to is the Head Master of Rugby;
the game is that of foot-ball. But for the mention of him and it in the
foregoing passage one might imagine the letter in which it occurs to
have been written at the seat of war, and to relate to wounds received
in action.
"Hacking," however, does not mean smiting with the edge of the
sword, but, we are informed, is a synonym of kicking, which, when
performed with a heavily-tipped boot, is capable of causing even worse
injuries than those ordinarily inflicted by a cutting instrument.
This "hacking," we are further informed, in foot-ball, is permitted
by the " Rugby Rules," which are the generally received laws of that
game. These regulations render a player liable, under certain circum-
stances, to be kicked when down on the ground,

. and, as the account of
the " Surgeon" above quoted shows, in any part of the body. His
opponents are permitted to force the ball out of his clutch by any
means other than fisticuffs.
Is it not advisable to amend this rule by simply reversing it, and
directing that it shall be allowable to get the ball away by no greater
violence than that of blows with the fist, and those only when the ball-
holder is on his legs P Then will the manly game of foot-ball be so far
humanised as not to exceed in brutality the noble art of self-defence as
normally practised in the prize-ring. If there is to be fighting at foot-
ball, let it be fair.
SCHOOL BOAEDS.
Mr. Punch,
Mr thoughts, this last week, have been travelling from Bootle
to Birmingham, from Southwark to Swansea, dwelling on the import-
ant events happening there and in various other places in London and
the country. The School Board Elections, present and to come, set
me thinking on a grave question—not whether education should be
voluntary or compulsory, secular or religious, free or on payment of
fees—but what guarantee the Ratepayers have that those they select
to be Guardians of the ignorant and untaught, are themselves fairly
acquainted with the ordinary branches of knowledge.
I have not heard or read that candidates for seats at Education
Boards have been examined by the Civil Service Commissioners or the
College of Preceptors: I fear that tin's desirable preliminary has
been entirely overlooked, and that we have no proof of the compe-
tence of the Governors to govern; and as 1 am one of those who
suspect that ignorance rages amongst the middle and higher, as
well as the lower classes, I have uncomfortable misgivings as to
the qualifications of some of the members of these new Election
Parliaments.
It is, of course, now too late to rectify this error in those places
where Boards have already been chosen; but, for the future, I hope
Mr. Forster will insist on candidates answering—to his and your
satisfaction, Mr. Punch—a few easy, simple questions, before they are
allowed to publish addresses, make speeches, and hire vehicles for the
conveyance of Voters to the poll.
I have prepared a specimen paper containing only twelve questions
in all, and I shall be curious to hear, either from you or the Vice-
President of the Committee of Council on Education, whether the
answers prove that I am right in my estimate of the amount of common
knowledge possessed by those classes who will have the working of the
new Act.
If my suggestion is adopted, the Candidates might assemble in a
convenient room in the Town Hall, or other suitable public building,
be supplied with writing materials, but no books of any description, and
have from ten to four allowed them for the preparation of their
answers. An adequate number "'of! influential Ratepayers should be
requested to attend, to prevent copying, and to enforce the strictest
silence—any lady or gentleman failing to observe the regulations would
be at once disqualified for office for three years.
I will now, Mr. Punch, submit to you the questions I have drawn
up:—
1. Give the dates of the following events:—the execution of C it atu.es
the First, the battles of Trafalgar and Waterloo, Gunpowder Plot,
the Accession of George the Third, the Great Fire of London, and
the birth (within twenty years or so) of Napoleon, Shaksprare,
Milton, and Sir Isaac Newton.
2. Who were the Queens of James the First and Second, and
what was the fate of each of Henry the Eighth's wives P
3. Explain briefly the following historical allusions:—the Massacre
of St. Bartholomew, the Arrest of the Five Members, the Trial of the
Seven Bishops, the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Fall of the
Western Empire, the Wars of the Roses, the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, the Rye House Plot, the Cato Street Conspiracy, the Seven
Years' War, the Hundred Days, and the Middle Ages.
4 Who wrote Don Quixote, Sir Charles (irandison, Absolom and
Achitophel, The Dunciad. Orlando t'urioso. The Vanity of Human Wishes,
Lycidas, She Stoops to Conquer, Timon of Athens, Wilhelm Meisler, The
Decameron, and Peter Plymley't Letters r
5. Give a short account of any one of these processes :—brewing,
tanning, paper-making, cotton-spinning, or the manufacture of gas or
chinr.
6. How is the electric telegraph worked P
7. Explain the terms, "atmospheie," "electricity," "oxygen,"
"eclipses," "tides" "latitude," "longitude," "equator," "equinox,"
"aorist," "decimals," and the " North Pole."
8. What is the geographical position of the Suez Canal, the Black
Sea, the Dardanelles, the Straits of Gibraltar, the Apennines, the
Cotswold Hills, Middlesborough, Paislev, Belfast, and the Caledonian
Canal P
9. Write out the following arithmetical tables:—Troy, Avoirdupois,
and Long Measure.
10. If seven men can dig a trenoh sixty feet long, three deep, and
five wide in thirteen days, how many days will eleven men be digging
a trench one hundred feet long, four deep, and seven and a half wide P
11. What was the "Lancasterian" system of instruction, and
that known as the " Madras," or Dr. Bell's P Who was Pestalozzi,
and what do you understand by " Kindergarten P"
12. Correct the spelling of the following sentence :—" On sevaral
succesive days seperate parties came greatly exhilirated, and were
recieved in an agreable manner by the new veterinary surgeon, Mr.
Baetholemew White, who had that moment returned on his poney
to a home where, posessed of independant means, he spent his iesure
surounded with all the elegances of life, which, however, he could not
appreciate, because of his vaccilating temperement, inherited from his
father, the well-known apothecery, whose life was once in iminent
danger from the ialling of a neighbours' wall." Ignoramus
THREE CHEERS FOR THE LADIES.

And Miss Emily Davies

Each thing has its place:

Or a-top of a poll.

THREE BRITISH BLUNDERS.
We made three great mistakes in our conduct towards
the United States Government respecting the Alabama
affair. In the first place, we should never have admitted
that we might possibly have been to blame at all. In the
next, on the contrary, we ought to have complained to
them for not having agreed with us to abolish privateering.
In the third, we should have sent them in a tremendous
bill on account of the loss which we had to sustain in
consequence of the Cotton Famine. These are the things
which, had our places been reversed, they would certainly
have done themselves.
Warning to War-Makers.
M. Chaudordt has issued, for European perusal, a
circular setting forth in detail the ravage, pillage, con-
flagration, slaughter, insult, and humiliation which the
German troops, acting, he alleges, systematically under
orders, are inflicting upon France. Horrible atrocities.
Let us hope the French people will never, by abandoning
themselves to Napoleonic ideas, and being led to invade
their neighbours vain gloriously, draw the like upon them-
selves again.

DR. MANNING ON RIGHT AND WRONG.
rchrishop Manning is always
contributing to public amuse-
ment. "He has issued a Pas-
toral protesting against the
occupation of Rome by the Go-
vernment of Florence." This
reasonable manifesto contains
these words:—
"It is not, then, in the power,
because it is not in the right, of
any nation to destroy that which is
the joint inheritance of all. Nei-
ther is it in the right of any people,
for the gratifying of political aspi-
rations, to destroy the fundamental
order of the Christian world. To
do so, is to apostatise from that
Christian order; and no nation has
a right to apostatise from the laws or the civilisation of Christianity. It is
held, indeed, by certain modern politicians that a people has a right to
choose its religion. But the right to choose carries with it also the right
to reject; and no nation has a right to rejeot Christianity. It may, indeed
have the power to apostatise, but it can never have the right."
No, certainly not. The right of the Popr, as the Vicegerent of
Omniscience and Omnipotence, to reign absolutely over the Roman
people, is with evident justice regarded by Dr. Manning as "the
joint inheritance of all" Christian nations. So he naturally says, " We
look with amazement and fear at the apathy and silence of the Govern-
ments of Europe." As to the inheritance of an absolute Pope-King of
Rome, doubtless, the Governments of Europe too truly represent the
peoples. Strange to say, they do not appear at all disposed to vindicate
their inheritance! At this indisposition Dr. Manning may well look
"with amazement and fear." He cannot look on it without fear, and
that on his own account, if he expects to be the next Pope. In that
case he has the strongest reason to fear that he will not be allowed to
govern unwilling subjects with his nod. His amazement is itself not
at all amazing. No wonder Dr. Manning does not see that Govern-
ments and peoples must naturally consider that the less secular power
a Priest who claims Infallibility can wield, the better. Of course they
would think the more he had the better, if they did think him really
infallible, as Dr. Manning believes him.
Our titular Archbishop's notions of right are admirably sacerdotal.
He admits no distinction between political right and theological right.
No nation, he says, has a right to apostatise from Christianity. Theo-
logically this is indisputable by Christians. But a Turk might also
say, No nation has a right to apostatise from Mahometanism. Theo-
logically, this would be equally undeniable by Mahometans. Let the
Turk be anathemr. Christianity and Popery, in Dr. Manning's view,
are synonymous. Protestantism was an apostacy; the Pro'estant
denominations have no right to exist. But trey, like heretics as they
are, think they have; then how is the question to be settled, except by
fighting it out P
On the Continent there is only a little fighting now going on.
Couldn't it be considerably extended P Nations fight for " prestige."
Can't they also fight for the Popr P Oughtn't they P Ought there
not to be a European war at present raging for the purpose of replacing
the Pope on his temporal throne P What if it should prove another
Thirty Years'War P
The only alternative to a religious war is the recognition, for the
sake of peace, of the altogether to be condemned principle that Chris-
tians shall have the political right to turn Jews, if they like, and, if
discontented with their existing form of government, to change it for
another, even should they choose Mr. Mosrs or Mr. Solomons to
reign over them. Dr. Manning, of course, would, on the contrary,
have such apostates delivered over to a secular arm under ecclesiastical
guidance. And thinking, as he must, that the only right system of
government in the world is the Papal, no doubt he would, if he could,
allow of no Jews anywhere but in a Ghetto.
Critical Reporting.
The Bristol Daily Post, in giving a report of a political dinner, says,
a certain toast having been proposed,—
".Mil replied, and misquoted four lines from Marmion."
That's all. Mr. Punch heartily approves of this style. Generally
adopted, it would save readers from boredom, and orators from
blundering.
thratrical.
The Green Bushes is again being played at the Adelphi. This
is so perennial that it might fairly be called The Evergreen Bushes.
if he escapes being "interviewed" by the
AN OBJECT OF PITY.
Mr. Punch,
I am sorry for him. He has my pity, my commiseration, my
sympathy. Perhaps he did not foresee what he would have to undergo;
perhaps he does not even yet realise the seriousness of his position.
Was there no one at hand to warn him, to point out to him all the
consequences of the step he was taking r I fear it is now too late;
hut that he may not hereafter say he went to his fate without a single
friendly caution, I will lift the curtain, and display to his startled
gaze what there is awaiting him in the coming future.
All his life long he will have to raise his hat.
His autograph will be in great request: possibly there may be a
demand for portions of his hair; perhaps some very enthusiastic
admirer will pay a large sum for the glass out of which he drank,
when he "alighted for refreshment" at the Nonpareil Hotel,
Shardlemere.
He must make up his mind to go to the Royal Academy and see
himself on the walls in the Highland garb, in full evening dress, in the
robes of the Order of the Garter, and in the Windsor uniform.
He will have- the pleasure of reading biographical sketches of him-
self, and examining, his own faoe and tigure engraved on wood in the
illustrated papers.
He will be a lucky i
reporters for the Press.
He will have to make the acquaintance of Mayors and Corporations,
Provosts and Baillies; to receive addresses, and to return suitable
replies; and to dance the first set of quadrilles with the Lady
Mayoress.
He will have to head subscription lists, to visit Bazaars and Fancy
Fairs, to preside at public dinners and propose the toast of the even-
ing, to attend the meetings of Associations, to sit on Royal Com-
missions, to inaugurate Exhibitions, to deliver speeches at distri-
butions of prizes, to lay foundation stones and make bows in acknow-
ledgment of one hundred and seventy-five purses, and to be conducted
over gaols, hospitals, infirmaries, lunatic asylums, museums, reforma-
tories, ruins, sailors' homes, and all the other places of local interest.
He will become K.G., K.T., D.C.L., P.G. M. (he must of necessity
be a Freemason), and F.R.S.; a High Steward, an Honorary Colonel,
an ex officio Trustee. a Patron of the Anniversary Meeting of the
Charity Children at St. Paul's, an Elder Brother, a Lord Rector, a
Bencher of the Temple, a Doctor o( Civil Law, a Governor of the
Charter House, a Freetnannf the Cities of London, Edinburgh, and
Glasgow, and a Member of the Fishmongers' and Merchant Taylors'
Companies; and it will be his duty to purchase and wear in public all
kinds of antique and extraordinary uniforms, dresses, robes, costumes,
and decorations.
He will go to and fro escorted by Rifle Corps and Yeomanry Cavalry,
and be received by a Guard of Honour of the Honourable Artillery
Company.
He will be constantly in the Court Circular.
He will have poems, plays, essays, and Christmas Books dedicated
to him; and essenoes and perfumes, waltzes, galops, and quadrilles
called after his name.
He has been, and will be, the subject of thousands of conundrums
and acrostics.
And lastly, but not leastly, he will be the prey and victim of photo-
graphers at all times of his life, at all seasons of the year, and in all
sorts of attitudes and costumes. Already the epidemic is raging—
"LordLorse (just out)." "Makquis op Lorne. Beautiful carte
portrait, in Highland costume, 1«. Id. by post." "According to the
Glasgow Herald, a photographer in that city has received orders from
a London House for 60 000 photographs of the Marquis op Lornr."
"Messrs. Swamp & Swump have had the honour of taking an admir-
able photograph (carte de visile size) of the future husband of H.R.H.
the Princess Louise," &c.
I conclude, Mr. Punch, as I began, by saying I am sorry for him—
for the Marquis of Lohne.
The Man with The Eyrglass.
P.S. How fortunate it is that the Princess Louise having lived so
much in Scotland has grown accustomed to the melody of the
Bagpipes!
Episcopal Expedience.
"At the foundation of a New Church by the Bishop of Winchester,
about £250 was collected on the spot: no small amusement being caused by
the Bishop putting a practical end to the ' Bag v. Plate' controversy, by pass-
ing round his own Collegiate cap for the purpose of receiving the contributions."
Some pious folks have nurtured mental qualms.
If it be fit in plates to gather alms;
Wise Winton, of their qualms a modest quencher,
Not to be dished, sends round his humble trencher.

NO. VI.—MY MILITARY ACQUAINTANCE—BEING MEMOIRS OF PIPKIN.
B is five feet five and
a half in his slippers,
and five feet seven
in his boots, when
new. As his boots
get older so bis
martial height dimi-
nishes, lie, as it
were, lowers the
standard.
1 don't know any
man more military
looking—for bis size
and circumference.
1 mention circum-
ference because be
prides himself (at, bis
tailor's) on having a
very big chest. Ac-
cording to his own
description he is
all chest, develop-
ing the farther you
get from chin down-
wards. But, after all,
anatomical nomen-
clature is arbitrary,
so why shouldn't
little Pipkin call it
chest if he likes f By every law he lias a right to do what he likes
with his own, nay even to performing the Japanese Tommy Trick
of the Happy Despatch with bis own sabre—if he had one. His
whiskers are a kind of regulation clip, not unlike a pair of worn-out
hairbrushes after coming out of the soda-water wash, and of about
that brilliancy of colour. He is shaved late in the day, down some
remote alley, for twopence—the Barber putting a penny on to his
usual charge on account of the respectability of the connection.
Being shaved, as 1 have said, late in the day, there is, up to about
three in the afternoon, a gentle tinge of blue about the lower part of
his expressive countenance, which, being of a settled sunset hue (I
mean it never gets below a certain point of colour), looks, on the
whole, like a sort of Perpetual Perambulating Providential Promise of
fine weather to-morrow. He would make an excellent sign for the Rain-
bow Tavern in fleet Street, whenever that ancient hostelrie may require
an advertisement. Indeed, it would pay Pipkin to have bis likeness
taken in brilliant oils, and sell replicas of it to various public-houses.
As a sort of Masquis op Granry, Junior, in any uniform, he would
be invaluable to no end of landlords up and down the country from
Land's End to the North Pole. In previous states of existence he
must have been a lobster boiled, then a rabbit, then a guinea-pig, and
then he appears in the present stage of progression. But what he will
be—except found out a humbug—it is impossible to speak with any-
thing like certainty.
My Military Acquaintance, from having passed the greater part of
hie life in some place where there were barracks perpetually chang-
ing their occupants, has, himself, a really large circle of Military
Acquaintances, of whom he talks, individually and collectively, as his
bosom friends; that is when he is pretty sure that the person he
is addressing is not well informed on the subject. This is a peculiar
trait—among other peculiar traits—in the character of my Military
Acquaintance; every one is "a capital fellow," or " a first-rate chap."
"Do you know Chipton, of the Forty-first P" Pipkin will ask you.
If you do happen to know Chipton intimately, and if Chipton be at
all likely to turn up, then Pipkin will be guarded in his statement
respecting Chipton, of the Forty-first, and will merely say that "he
knows him," without a qualification of any sort, except a sort of a
knowing look, meant to imply that he could say something about
Chipton if he liked, but he won't. In this case it is most likely that
he has once met Chipton at the Regimental Mess, to which be has at
some time or other induced one of the [youngsters to invite him,
where he perhaps sat next to Chipton, or remarked to him before
dinner that it had or had not been a fine day. For on the strength of
as much as this, Pipkin would ask Chipton to do him a favour, and
think nothing of it.
If, on the other hand, Chipton, of the Forty-first, being the subject
of conversation, is in India, then little Pipkin will be sure to "know
him very well—intimately, his dearest friend, best fellow out—old
Chipton!" and here he will break off, as if words failed him (which,
indeed, they often do, specially good ones), to express all Chipton's
immense merits.
Martial ardour once led little Pipkin into the Militir. The tailor, I
believe, knowing Pipkin (he was to have been a Captain—perhaps he
is; indeed, I fancy that 1 have heard him say so at one period of a
long evening, but he is a trifle silent on his Militia exploits, as a true
hero always should be)—the tailor, so the legend runs, knowing our
friend Pipkin, requested money for the uniform in advance, which
somewhat disgusted this tremendous warrior, and he resigned his com-
mand, after paying for one week's hire of military costume from
Nathan's—period unknown.
His term of endearment is " Old Man," for any one from eighteen
to forty. I should say he knows very few men past forty; they know
him by that time. The older Pipkin becomes, the younger must be his
intimates.
I see him from the Club window, lounging down Pall Mall.
Here come his little legs, looking as symmetrical as a Punch doll's,
encased in tightish trousers, half ring-man, halt' trainer, with not the
slightest trace of the cavalry officer in either legs or boots, whioh look
as if they'd been picked up second-hand and widened out at the toes
with a glove-stretcher. Even ids trousers seem as if they'd been left
him by a friend. Every one knows of the absurd conditions .annexed
to certain wills; some men have to drive a four-in-hand every .day for
a hundred thousand a-year; others to wind up a watch twice in an
afternoon, ior visit the Monument after dark, or anything else equally
absurd and ridiculous. 1 think little Pipkin must be enjoying a legacy
on condition of wearing one pair of trousers, or never coming out in
anything but secondhand clothes and boots, the second gleas well on
the former, and the latter past polishing. He is dingy by daylight, but
as they say, "Jtghts upfwellat-night." Indeed, to see Pipkin in a stall at
the theatre, scaled mind you, is a real imposition. PiPKiN,in a stall, as
a half-length portrait, has a military bearing. One glance at Pipkin,
full length, dispels the illusion. He-eschews gloves, except at evening
parties, and then his gloves and tie can be done well at eighteenpence
the lot, and a profit to the cheap haberdasher. His hands are in
keeping with his military tone generally, and are, so to apeak, uniform
with it, being of an emphatic and undisguised red.
For his moustache he uses a great quantity of some horrid stuff
called ([ believe) "fixature," which makes both little stubbly points
stand out as far as they '11 go, like a clipped Louis Napoleon. They
have about as much point as Pipkin's jokes, which, indeed, are of the
flattest kind. Apparently he melts down the fixature and washes in
it—as a made-up beauty is said to do with some sort of paste—as he
has for the most part a gummy appearance, as if a postage-stamp
would adhere to his cheek affectionately propria motu, and without any
external emollient aid.
Yet have I heard ladies ask, "Is Mr. Pipkin in the army P" and I
confess to a pleasurable feeling in being able to answer in the negative.
But for all this he is my Military Acquaintance.
(To be resumed with our nexl Cigarelle.)
BRAVE WORDS.
Says General Faidherre, in his Proclamation to the "Army of
the North " :—
"M. Gamretta has declared that, to save Franco, he requires from you
three things—discipline, morality, and contempt of death."
How can contempt of death be bred except by familiarity P When
a man has died he may feel contempt for death, if he exists better off.
Before death, to contemn death, if he thinks, he needs to be sure that
death is contemptible.
Hyems and Hymen.
The marriages continue to be vastly out-numbered by the births and
deaths. One day last week the Times, announced eighteen births and
as many as forty-one deaths, but only seven marriages. The cold
weather may co-operate with the Married Women's Property Act. The
sea-side is now not eligible for the honeymoon. Young couples would
be likely to catch cold there, and then, if they took the most agreeable
of remedies for that affection, their honeymoon would become a rum-
and-honeymoon.
The Irish Papists' Petition.
The Irish Church you severed from the State;
Choose their own rule, you say, let foreign Powers:
Now, then, impose the reign which Romans hate
On Rome, because the Pope's religion 'a ours.
UP ABOVE THE WORLD SO HIGH.
Even in the realm of Nature all is not natural. The influence of our
artificial state of society seems to be felt in scenes where it might
have been thought all would be simple and unstudied, for in the last
monthly history of the weather in the Times, we are surprised by the
intrusion of " the conventional black cloud."

BETWEEN THE HOSTS.
Like him of old, -when the plague's arrows sped,
And life sank blighted by that scathing rain,
We stand between the living and the dead,
Lifting oar hands and prayers to Heaven in vain.
While those that faint upbraid us from dim eyes,
And those that fight arraign us as they fall.
And French and German curses 'gainst us rise,
And, hating none, we rest unloved of all.
Till in a bitter stress of doubt we wait,
And hardly dare or know to shape our prayer,
Beyond the aching wish to see abate
This woe and waste that darken all the air,
And make the winter fog seem like a pall _
Laid on the death-struck earth, and hiding heaven
From the fierce eyes of those that fight and fall,
And theirs, to whom the wearier lot is given,
To sit. with innocent and unarmed hands,
Ana listen to the guns, far off or near;
To watch war's ravage trample down their lands,
And sweep off growth and storage of their year.
And heap with death's swathes, sow with corpses seed,
Fields bared of kindly grass and feeding grain;
To see their furrows filled from wounds that bleed,
And mark on wall and hearth-stone death's dull stain.
Shall we dare counsel baffled, bleeding France,
As she creates defiance from despair,—
"Throw up the lost game; bow to conquest's chance,
And tame thyself the vanquisher's lot to bear" P
When 'tis this stubbornness, that, in her place,
Oar prayer and joy 'twere in ourselves to find:
When what we love best in her worn, wan. face.
Is the bent brow that speaks the unyielding mind.
Or shall we dare advise the German foe,
As with firm step, clear purpose, iron will,
He moves on to his goal through waste and woe—
"For all thy sons' blood thou hast had to spill,
For all thy treasure thou hast had to spend,
Thy breaking up of homes, and wrench of hearts,
With less than retribution waive thine end,
For love of thy foe's charms and witching arts " P
We own the provocation, foully given,
That knit a nation's hearts in bonds of steel;
But think a shattered throne, great armies driven
In rout, or held beneath the conqueror's heel,
Set-off sufficient for that traitor-stroke—
Imperial ruin 'gainst Imperial raid—
Yet pity for this people how invoke,
That brooks no pity and implores no aid P
We love French wit, love France's courteous cheer,
And skill in arts that make life fair and bright,
As we respect the German soul sincere,
Thoroughness, learning, patience, faith in right;
Nor scorn we France's false and fickle brood,
Hating all truth that frets its self-conceit,
More than we loathe the German's stolid mood,
That travels to its ends with iron feet.
And so we stand with a divided soul,
Our sympathies for both at war within,
Now eager for the strong, to reach his goal, _
More often wishing that the weak could win.
Only one feeling will not leave our minds,
Hate of this hate, and anguish of this woe;
And still war's scythe-set car rolls on and grinds
Guilty and guiltless, blent in overthrow.
And first we interpose a useless hand,
And then we life an unavailing voice,

A CLAP OF STAGE THUNDER.
Worthy Mr. Punch,
Cynics say that there are no dramatic critics now-a-days, for
what is now called criticism is nothing but false praise. Puffery reigns
supreme, they think, in this department of the Press, and public writers
are so swayed by private motives towards laudation that anything like
censure never comes from their paid pens. Well, this may be true in
general, but there are certainly exceptions, as witness these remarks
in a recent bit of criticism in the Daily News:—
"He had no story to tell which was worth telling ... he had not even
the faintest idea of how to handle a plot . . . nor is the delineation of charac-
ter exactly his forte . . . his dialogue is weak and diffuse . . . his soenes, as
a rule, lead to nothing, while his acts invariably terminate with an anti-
climax."
A pleasant breakfast must the author have had after his "first
night," if he found upon his table many notices of his new drama such
as this! But, supposing there be fair grounds to justify such censure,
I cry " Bravo!" to the writer who has the pluck to pen it. I consider
that in pointing out the weak points of a play, a critic merely does
what he is privileged and paid to do. As a writer for the public, it is
his business and his duty to tell the public truly his opinion of a piece.
When a play should be condemned, it is his province to speak plainly,
and so prevent his readers from wasting time and money on a
worthless work. The public have a right to look for censure in the
newspapers when censure is deserved: and, failing this, the critics may
be viewed as merely hireling manufacturers of pulls. Too many write
with rosewater where they rather should use vinegar; and if severity
in criticism is ever to become still rarer than it is, we may live to see
the public tendering their thanks for it in some such form as this:—
"Mr. Punch begs to express the gratitude of the public for the
sensible severity wherewith the Press has criticised the stupid play
produced on Monday evening last. The critics have so seldom the
courage to condemn, that a special word of thanks is in this instance
their due: and, sneaking in the name of British playgoers in general,
Mr. Punch would fain express their gratefullest acknowledgment of
the way in which a clumsy, dull, and ineffective play has most de-
servedly been doomed."
Leaving you on due occasion to carry out the hint, I remain,
Yours most admiringly,
Tartarus Place, Tuesday. Rhadamanthus Jones.

WOMEN'S NATURAL RIGHTS.
The question of Married Women's Property has not yet reached a
settlement. On the evening of Monday week a meeting of the Victoria
Discussion Society was held in the Cavendish Rooms to discuss it.
Opinions were expressed by ladies and gentlemen in a succession of
speeches which led to no conclusion; but Sir Erskine Perry, who
occupied the Chair, made a significant remark:—
"The Chairman observed that the subject about to be discussed was one of
frreat importance to every household. It affected both heads of families and
their children, and affected them in tre most serious and important manner."
No doubt. The subject of Married Women's Property is one about
which a husband and wife may differ, so as to quarrel and rave. Thus
it may affect the heads of families very seriously. And, as affections
of the head are often hereditary, it may indirectly affect their children
likewise. These considerations must make prudent men think, not
twice only, but three or four times, or more, before they marry, unless
they propose to marry a girl without any but naturally personal
perry; oftentimes the cheapest as well as the most generous marri
pro-
generous marriage.
There was something also in what was said by another of the
speakers:—
"Mr. Hosktns . . . contended that the married women of England had
hitherto been very unfairly treated with regard to property. He, Mr.
Hoskyns, contended that husbands should treat their wives as equal human
beings. He did not consider that they had been so treated hitherto."
Very true, Hoskyns, in a measure. On the whole. perhaps, women
have not been treated like equal human beings. However, they are
always helped first at dinner, and men usually stop at a door, and let
their female companions enter first. And this is right. Persons of
the ruder sex, meaning to be rude, often make a remark which is truer
than they imagine, for them at least. "Woman," they say, "is the
inferior animal." "Yes," may be the reply, " but she is the superior
human being." Let every husband, therefore, duly resign to his wife
the liver-wing of a fowl, unless she prefers the gizzard, and let him at
least give her the refusal of the pheasant's leg.

Educational Colours.
The Pott, in a leader on the subject of education, has the following
remark relative to "street Arabs" and "gutter-children" who will be
educated in the new national schools:—
"But the colourless religion which will be part of their mental pabulum
will be better than their present no-religion."
Ought not religion, pure and simple, to be colourless P Light is of
no colour until it is decomposed.

STRAWBERRY LEAVES.
A SELECTION FROM THE VERY LATEST LETTERS OF THE HONOURABLE
HORACE WALPOLE, OF STRAWBERRY HILL, FAVOURED BY OUR
PRIVATE SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
To Sir Horace Mass.
Wr have snow! Come, my dear Sir, do not pretend not to under-
stand the word. An Italian of my name has told you something about
it. Take him out of my friend Theodore Martin's book (as charming
a rendering of Latin poetry into English as we shall see)
"Enough of snow, enough of direful hail
Hath Jove in auger showered upon the land."
I used to like it, but labuntur anni. This year, moreover, I regard
it with abhorrence, for I think what this weather means to the poor
wretches who, by the will of Kings and Republics,'are lying hideously
wounded. I send you the Times newspaper. Be pleased to read, if
you can bear to read, a Correspondent's account of what he saw after
the great sortie. Translate it to your Countesses who prate of glory,
I wish that there were some way of disclaiming one's share in this
world's wickedness. I would go to London, even'in this weather, and
with.my gout, to sign the deed. But would.it be enrolled .in the
supreme Chancery P
People speak of Christinas. It has long ceased to be anything but
a word, and a disagreeable one for me. But I am glad to help those to
enjoy the season who can. The Day falls on Sunday, and my old
housekeeper, Margaret, is indignant, and accuses the Government
of some kind of mismanagement in allowing this. I have seen as well-
founded charges made against Mr. Gladstone. Folks, " whose talk
is of bullocks," tell me that the Beast Show is the best that has ever
been held. I wish an Aladdin's magician could fly away with the
whole, and set it down in the middle of Paris.
The Eclipse philosophers have gone forth to seize the'precious two
minutes. Ladies are with them, I suppose to dust up the sun and
moon and make them fit for inspection. Doubtless the expedition has
a wonderful object, but I decline to incur the headache which would
be the price of my understanding it. A little girl asked me why the
sun and moon were made round and not square, and I told her that if
they had been square their corners might have been knocked off in
eclipses. I believe the Government dawdled terribly in giving the
assistance which the astronomers required. The Americana showed a
hundred times more zeal and sense, of course, as they always do.
They reverse the religious and gracious King Charles's rule, seldom
talk wisely, and never act foolishly. They will annex us one of these
days, and then there will be some hope for this worn-out old island. I
hope they will let me keep Strawberry, even at the price of knocking
outfall my poor painted Kings and Queens, harmless as such folks
are—in glass.
I did not mean to allude again to the horrid war, but I could not
help thinking, the other day, of M. Thiers. The forts about Paris
were, you know, his work. They bellowed and roared so hideously in
the last affair that Russell was reminded [of Sevastopol. Can't you
imagine little Thiers listening to the noise, and saying, with John
Dennis, "By Jove, that's my thunder!"
We had a play condemned—that is the polite word in spite of the
late Bishop of Exeter—last week. It was by a nobleman, too, Lord
Newry, and it was called Ecartt, and brought out at the Globe. It
did not please the public, which induces me to think that there must
have been something good in it. For the present generation of
playgoers is so intellectually demoralised that its censure involves
a compliment. In the course of the evening, the Manageress, Miss
Alleyne, provoked at the failure, addressed some sharp words to
the audience. I like her courage. Bad she been a deep-mouthed,
masculine tragedian, who could have bullied them with growls, and
told them he was ashamed of such un-English conduct to artists
who were doing their 'umble best," the scolding would have been ap-
plauded, and the piece saved. But they had courage to go on jeer-
ing a woman. The play has been withdrawn, "on account of the
Manageress's indisposition," a final defiance which I also like. Not
that most pieces do not deserve to be condemned, but that audiences
who admire our present sort are not competent judges. When, as I
told you years ago, the pretty men and theTemplars went to damn a piece
brought out by Garrick, and he was impertinent about it, I defended
them. But then they knew good plays from bad.
The Scotch are going to hold festival on the hundredth anniversary
of the birth of Sir Walter Scott. This is right enough. I have an
interest in Scotland. My father, "old Sir Robert" (would 1 had
half his sense and goodness), paid the Scotch Members ten guineas a
week during the Session, and by a singular coincidence they all thought
him a very great man—during the Session. I hope that the affair will
not be muddled, as was the case with the Burns and Shakspeare
Centenaries. It would be an agreeable variation from Scotch rule were
it solemnly announced that none of the orators should quote from the
said Burns, but this is too much to expect. Dios me libre de hombre

I have no politics for von. "The Liberals have been trying to eject
Douglas Straight, a rising young barrister, whom the Conservatives
got in for Shrewsbury. The proceedings were a farce; there was no
sort of case against him. Whig as I am, I am glad of the failure, for
the Liberals lost the election by their own blundering, and sought an
unworthy revenge. In the present state of parties, my good Sir, we
can afford to be dispassionate. You and I remember other days in
Shropshire, when all its twelve Members were returned by that amiable
Indian philanthropist, Lord Clive, and were irreverently called his
apostles. The county has not distinguished itself much of late years.
Disraeli was the last notable elected by the proud Salopians.
I have looked at your friend B 's book. I am not much illumi-

were to have twenty thousand additional lamps. He would reduce
everything to the standard of reason. Bon. But when I find he
means the standard of his own reason—adieu, Mr. P> . I have lived
in a better Arcadir. He will do no good, but neither will he do any
harm, but pray don't tell him this latter fact . as it will put him into the

weather, the room was awfully hot. "Ah! Captain ," says the
Duke, "this is more like the South Pole than the North, eh P" I
told it to a lady friend of his, who did not smile. I remarked on this.
"I ought to smile," she said, "for I am really pleased to hear that he
knows there are two poles." I think he must have refused her some-
thing, she is generally honey on velvet. If she has missed anything
(you know her) it was not for want of asking. She would stop a
jockey in the finish for the Derby, and ask for a lock of his hair, if it
occurred to her that she could get anything by giving it to somebody.

Her vulgarity is natural, but I am not sure that some of her ignorance
is not assumed. There was astronomical talk the other night at Sir
Wrock Tapper's (the geologist), and he offered to fetch a spectro-
scope. She desired him not to bring such a thing into the room, she
hated ghosts and all their belongings. By the way they tell me that
instrument, or no I believe it's another called a polariscope (bless their
jargon), reveals whether light be original or borrowed. If such a
thing could be invented for the benefit of a book critic, who usually
knows nothing of a subject but what he learns from the work he is

"TT7ANTED, by a Steady 'Widower, with a good home, aged 40, with children,
VV a luitable Woman, aa HEAD SERVANT or WIFE. '—Advertisement.
What an accommodating widower! How humble, how easily satisfied! He
only wants "a suitable woman" to act "as Head Servant or Wife." She may
undertake either the one post or ihe other, whichever she pleases—there is little or
no difference between them in the valuation of her intending employer or husband.
Each is a place, a situation, to be taken and filled; and if the woman lucky
enough to be engaged, after a month's trial or so, "does" for her "steady
widower" to his satisfaction, gives him comfortable meals, keeps the children in
order, and proves a careful tidy body, her title, at all events, will be changed,
although her position in the household may remain much the same—the " head
servant" will become the second wife, and there will be a plain, a very plain
wedding, probably celebrated by the Registrar, with no superfluities of bridesmaids,
or bells, or new garments, or marriage gifts, or ridiculous luxuries.
As wife she must not expect to have the control of much ready money, for
we would wager the "steady widower" will be purse-bearer, and not given to
opening it too often or too wide; nor hope to exercise more power and authority
than she possessed when "head servant;" and as for love, affection, endear-
ments, and the like, what business has a man of forty with such encumbrances,
especially one who is indifferent whether he takes "a suitable woman" into his
kitchen as servant, or into his bosom as partner.
There will be a multitude of applicants, and they will send their characters
and references, and some their photographs. We should like to see their letters,
their portraits, and, before all, themselves; and if Mr. Punch thought the adver-
tising widower could care for such a vanity as personal appearance, a comely face
and a comfortable figure he would affectionately urge him not to engage any one
of the competitors either as domestic or consort, without a personal interview,
the "party" chosen for inspection, of course, to pay her own travelling expenses,
and to remain at a respectable public-house in the neighbourhood, at her own
charges, during approval.
Is there not some permanent Committee or Convention which looks after
Woman's rights and wrongs P _ Mr. Punch lays this case before .them at their
next meeting, with the deferential expression of his opinion, that if a deputation
composed of two or three of the very strongest-minded of the members could
wait upon the "Widower," they might, by tract and argument, at all events, induce
him to withdraw his ungallant advertisement.

A GREAT DAY.
There have been grand doings at Windsor, at the
South-Western Railway Station, in celebration of the
return visit paid by the Empress Eugenie to Her
Majesty at the Castle. No doubt the Empress has
addressed an autograph letter of thanks to the Directors
and officials, in acknowledgment of the extraordinary
preparations they made for her reception, with a disregard
of expense (and coal) which even in this country of pomp
and display has rarely, if ever, been.equalled. For what
do we readP That the "suite of Royal waiting-rooms
opposite the arrival platform were in readiness, and fire*
had been lit in order to insure the comfort of the visitors.
We have emphasised, by the aid of the italic letter, the
words last quoted, because it may not occur to all readers
that the day of the Empress's visit to Windsor was
Monday the 5th inst., when a fire was considered an indis-
pensable necessity by everybody who could afford a scuttle
of coals. The next dividend of the South-Western Railway
is not likely to suffer through any reckless profusion on the
part of the Company in receiving their Imperial visitor.

SCHOOLING FOR SAVAGES.

Were flogged on last Friday in gaol;
Each reaped the reward of his deeds,
Whilst howls rode aloof on the gale.
Henceforth, when they rob, to garotte,
Likewise, the; will probably cease:
Beneath twenty-five were the lot—
They had twenty lashes a-piece.
E'en ruffians have feelings of touch,
Affections wbereon whipcord tells;
Those same it affected so much—
Some fainting were borne to their cells.
Then, if you garotters would win,
Appeal to their tenderest part;
Teach pupils like them through the skin—
The sole way of reaching the heart.

WATKINS IN EXCELSIS.
(an ode.)
"Mr. John Watkins, of Parliament Street, had the honour of attending
at Windsor Castle on Saturday last, and taking several photographs of
Princess Louihr, the Masquih op Lohne having previously given sittings
to him. Mr. Wat kins is also engaged on portraits of the eight peers'
daughters who have been distinguished by selection as the Boyal bride-
maids."
Hail, well-starred Watkins! well-starred Watkins, hail!
No more obscura shall thy camera stand!
To work! Develope, tone, print, mount, wholesale,
For dealing out in packs, about the land,
Court Cartes of our Louise and of her Lorne—
And bear aloft thy head, and rear on high thy horn!
Two negatives, our schoolboy grammars told,
Of one affirmative the force attain:
But these two negatives a rank shall hold
Apart, alone, for glory and for gain—
And positives, comparatives, out flown,
Be reached to by superlatives alone!
All other cynosures of eyes they '11 rob,
The nine-day lease of shop-front life defy:
And to the question, "Is John Bull a snob P"
Ten millions of affirmatives supply—
Proving, whatever else John Bull may be,
Sublimest snob of all Earth's snobs is he:
That John Bull loves a lord, has oft been said,
And shown, since lords have been for Bull to love:
But how he loves a lord who wooes to wed
A Royal Princess, still remained to prove.
And show how in John's coat the broadcloth fine
The filthy dowlas of it serves to line.
For when, to back the snobbishness of John,
You call John's loyalty, our fancy seems
Rapt into heights beyond great Jenkins' own—
Region ot Flunkeydom's divinest dreams,
Where rank is both the guinea-stamp and gold,
And man as man but dross and dirt we hold:
Where happy Snobbishness, awe-struck, agape,
Crawls, prone, to Rank's shrine, with its offered pelf,
And bows it down to Majesty's pet ape
Drest in the robes of Majesty itself,
Ablaze with gems of Brummagem, foil-set,
In pinchbeck of a Brummagem coronet.
0 happy Watkins, feeding this twin flame
Of snobbishness and loyalty combined,
When with Louise's and with Lorne's thy name
On Jenkins' roll of Fame shall stand entwined,
And when the eight peers' daughters thou hast ta'en,
Die, Watkins! What holds Earth for thee to gain P
"Forbear, irreverent scoffer!" At my ear
John Bull's indignant voice I seemed to seize,—
"How dare you mock what you, as I, hold dearP
Who but Punch has been Laureate to Louise P
If 'tis a Snob's part at her stool to bow,
Who in this land has been more Snob than thou P"
'Tis true, O Bull, and so thou own with me
The majesty of gracious maidenhood,
Paying the homage of a bended knee
Unto the woman, gentle, fair, and good,
Graced with all arts, and, chiefest among these,
Endowed with woman's master-art—to please,
1 '11 waive the charge of snobbishness, and say,
"Let John Bull and his Punch, companions vowed,
At the same shrine manly allegiance pay,
High in humility, in meekness proud—
As good Knights to their ladye bent the knee,
To love, not ladyship, in fealty!"

FRESH FACTS ABOUT CHRISTMAS-

On Christmas-Day King Arthur, filled his new Round Table (ma-
hogany was then only to be found in great houses) with poor relations,
and placed an envelope containing a bank-note for a considerable
amount in the folds of each of their napkins. After dinner, Merlin,
his poet laureate, stood on a stool covered with wild oats, and recited
the principal events of the year in iambics, and then the guests snow-
balled each other till it was time to go. Arthur never went to bed,
but roamed about " the wild woods of Broceliaude " all the rest of the
night singing madrigals to a theorbo, in a velveteen jacket.
For many generations on the evening of the 24th of December the
Druids who belonged to the old county families—rather Odd Fellows
in their way, and Bachelors by compulsion of the Canon law—danced
round their Christmas-tree (the oak with its hanger-on, the mistletoe)
for three-quarters of an hour, without intermission or refreshment, to
the Music of the Past in the moonlight, and then had bun and ale in
their own private apartments. On the last day of the year they con-
cluded the evening with quoits and good resolutions for the future.
The Scandinavian races steep the yule-log in British brandy, before
they hurl it on the hearth-fire with a look out of the corners of their
eyes; and such of the women as are unmarried, after streaking their
cheeks with red ochre, proceed to knock up the constable of the
parish, to present him with a bowl of furmety spiced with ambergris:
meanwhile the Scalds sing carols through their noses till he puts his
head out of the window and gives them largess to stop. The Scandi-
navians make a point of having frost and snow at this season; and
before civilisation, with all its baneful results, was thrust upon them,
the tradesmen never thought of sending in their accounts.
Holly rhymes with jolly, and was supposed to banish melancholy
long before the invention of printing, the old chroniclers telling us
that the Anglo-Saxon maidens decorated the churches with its polished
leaf and berry (under the superintendence of the curate), as far back as
the stream of history is navigable. Petrarch first saw Laura, when
she was twining a wreath of laurustinus, with a piece of string, round
one of the serpentine pillars in the great church at Amsterdam.
The oldest and largest wassail bowl in Christendom is preserved in
the vestry of the Vatican. It is never used except when the Pope has
the entire College of Cardinals to supper. On this occasion all for-
mality is laid aside, and etiquette is consigned to the tomb of the
Capulets. The Pope himself roasts the apples, and the two youngest
Cardinals make the toast and grate the nutmeg, while hunt the Pope's
Slipper and other sports are freely indulged in till midnight. "Was-
sail is merely a corruption of "vassal," the great Saxon lords and
their serfs having been- accustomed all to drink out of the steaming
bowl in common at Christmas-tide.
There is a very ancient illuminated receipt for plum-pudding amongst
the MSS. in the Ambrosial Library at Milan, its antiquity is proved
by the fact that candied peel is not mentioned as one of the ingredients,
and candied peel we know, from Opsonius and other contemporary
authors, was introduced into cookery long before the present, err.
There were enactments, about Snapdragon at a rery early period
(see the laws of Draco), and the charming story of St. George and the

When in the balance India hung,—

'Gainst our few swords to weight the scale,—
And .England's star looked dim and pale,
Who, sorely strained, but ne'er o'erthrown,

PUNCH, OB THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A MERRIMAN TO THE RESCUE!
he renowned "Widdicomre,
Master of the Horse at
Astley's, of old, was wont,
between the acts of horse-
manship, to address himself
to the Clown in the King,
saying, "Now then, Mr.
Merryman, let ns have
some of jour 'facetir.'" In
these words Mr. Widdi-
comre meant to invite his
associate to play the fool.
Mr. Mehjuman, one of
the leaders in the generous
agitation for a war with
Prussia in the interest of a
French Republic, which has
not as yet been constituted
by France, is not to be con-
founded with any personage
of the name and office above
referred to in connection
with Mr. Widdicomre. He
has, however, been lately
giving ua not a few of his
"facetia," as Mr. Widdi-
comre used to say. He
has talked a good deal of fan at public meetings; for the suggestion
that the Government of our Constitutional Monarchy should plunge
into war on behalf of the Republic of a future in nubibus, to please
the International Democratic Union, is a high joke.
Also Mr. Merriman has written a letter to the Times, resenting its
description of bim, between inverted commas, as "Mr. Merriman of
Queen Street;" and showing that the Merrimans are no mushrooms,
but an old civic family. Very likely indeed they are. Perhaps, like
the Slys, they "came in with Richard Conqueror." Their acti-
quity, no doubt, was higher than that of the merry men associated in
ballad and legend with Rorin Hood. For, in fact, we do not call
them the Merrymen, which would be as ridiculous as calling Mussul-
mans Mussulmen.
The more the pity, then, that the good old name of Merriman
(originally, perhaps, Mi ram ant) should, by its mere sound, be liable
to be associated with the idea of a Circus fool. It ought not to be so
sounded. A name of the same high order as the names of Cholmon-
deley, Grosvenor, and the like, it should manifestly be abbreviated,
as they are, in speaking. Merriman is the analogue of Marjori-
ranks, evidently, and ought to be pronounced Merman. So indeed
the Merrimans themselves, the Nobility and Gentry, pronounce it, for
aught we know.
Chivalry merits a chivalrio style of name. There'is perhaps more
chivalry than wisdom in Mr. Merriman's enthusiastic republicanism.
There is something heraldic in the idea of a Merman; the monster so
called figures in some coats of arms, and, although a monster, is not a
ludicrous object like the zany whose image is suggested by .the
unmodified name of Merkiman.
BEAUTY AND THE BADGER
Propessor Huxley, in his tenth lecture on Physiography, delivered
for the improvement of the female mind at South Kensington, had
occasion to invite the ladies to consider how it happened that our
native animals are the same as those found on the neighbouring Conti-
nent; if for example, they came thence, how did they cross the Channel .'
Amongst them he specified the Badger, a creature "by no means fond
of swimming" and described it as "an animal now pretty nearly
extinct." Unhappily, that is so. As a lecturer, Propessor Huxley's
time was limited, or else he might, as a naturalist, addressing ladies,
have invoked the sympathy of Beauty for the Badger.
This is one of the many interesting members of the British fauna
improved off the face of the British earth, under the name of vermin.
It does no damage whatsoever, beyond eating a few partridges' eggs,
whilst it destroys a quantity of real vermin. The much more mis-
chievous Fox is preserved for the purpose of hippolatry, as a sacrifice;
or else the British Museum would soon contain the only specimens of
that subject of Her Majesty's animal kingdom; and of what, use are
stuffed specimens there, if living ones are of none in Nature-!*' Our
foxes, as well as our badgers, would also be exterminated, but for
horse-worship; abolished, likewise, for the sake of a small preservation
of game, by our lauded poulterers. If Members of Parliament had
been addicted to badger-baiting, badgers would have been preserved,
as foxes are; but whilst fox-hunting is a noble sport, badger-baiting
is cruelty to animals.
A SCHOOLMASTER AT HOME.
The Education Act is already doing great good. It is exciting
and developing the energies of men who aspire to improve their gene-
ration. Here is proof in a letter addressed to a friend of Mr. Punch.
The writer ought certainly to come under the favourable notice of
Lord Lawrence :—
"Sir—It is possible that a little reccomendation now that Village Scole-
mutera are likely to be in requiiition, might be a great benifit to Me. As a
reador of my own language I would Challange Norfolk. "Geography."
"Arithmetic." "Grammar" "Scripture Biography." History. "Natural
History." Even a little Astronomy if it were needed if the possession of a
little of all Branches of useful Education not only in the Theory." but in
Extensive Practice be any use. I beg an interest in the influence which you
possess and shall remain "Gratefully vow's
Gratitude, which is said to be a lively sense' of future favours, is
pleasingly exemplified in the penultimate word; and, on the whole,
Punch thinks the epistle worth insertion in our Educational Annals.
A Professional View of Things.
In the eyes of a^tnoughtful Confectioner, the ground covered with
snow resembles nothing so much as a huge bridecake.
Motto for Rarrit Poachers.—" Not particular to a Hare."
OUR NATIONAL AND PERSONAL ENEMIES.
Too sensitive Englishmen need to be reminded that the malignant
sneers which foreigners are always casting at this country are exactly
like the language in which scamps are wout to abuse a respectable man
with whom they happen to be connected. They hate him because he
won't bet, won't gamble, keeps out of scrapes which they* get into,
won't countenance their rogueries: and, although he has done them good
offices, because, when they try to cheat him they find they can't.
There is one difference, however, between the respectable man and
John Bull. The respectable man will not endorse the scamp's
bills. John Bull does, in effect, as a matter of form, for the sake of
fence; and when the bills are dishonoured, declines taking them up.
t would be better if he did not endorse their bills. Foreigners might
hate him no less than they do, but would not perhaps despise him
quite so much—if that is of any consequence.
AUDACIOUS. IF NOT INSPIREDP
At the meeting lately held in St. James's Hall to express sympathy
with the Pope, Ajichrishop Manning asserted that :—
"Divine Providence had solved the question of how States should be related
to the Church, by investing the Head of it with a temporal sovereignty."
Doubtless Dr. Manning is incapable of saying the thing which is
not, knowing it not to be. Nor is he to be supposed capable of saying
that a thing is, especially a thing which is, if it is, a solemn truth,
unless he knows, or thinks he knows it, to be. Wc should, therefore,
conclude that, at least, he thinks he knows that which he, as above,
affirms. He must, then, think himself highly favoured among men—
a spiritual medium of the genuine kind and the highest order.
In the meanwhile, the Head of Dr. Manning's Denomination has
been divested of the temporal sovereignty which Dr. Manning declares
him to have been divinely invested with. Dr. Cumming might say
that the Power, which Dr. Manning says invested him with it, divested
him of it. How are we to decide when such Doctors disagree?
A Noisy Clergyman.
Accordwo to an article in the Echo, the Rzv. A. H. Stanton,
Curate of St. Alban's, while speaking at a meeting of the English
Church Union, on the Mackonochie case, said that if the Privy
Council "should take everything from him, his money, and even his
clothes, he would remain a priest nevertheless." Mr. Punch's advice
to the Privy Council is to leave this Reverend Gentleman his clothes,
but to take away from him his gown.
Classical Con.

effort to be up and stirring even at eight! But as we read on we get
bewildered, for we are told that Her Majesty was back at Windsor at
155 p.m. precisely," and that the trip " only occupied three hours and
thirty-five minutes." Calculations of time must be very different at
Windsor Castle (or in Printing House Square) from what they are in
Fleet Street; and it would be more satisfactory if some learned Society,
such as the Astronomical or the Horological, would help puzzled readers
to solve this perplexing problem.
Spilt Milk and Worse.
The saying that there is no use in crying over spilt milk applies to
all fluids of which the waste is deplorable. Journalists disregard this
saying when they lament bloodshed, and they equally ignore the admo-
nition it implies when they aggravate the bray ana the cackle which
tend to war.

• HORACE WALPOLE, OF STRAWBEBBY HILL. FAVOUBED BY OUR
PRIVATE SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
To Sir Horace Mann.
I hope that yon have not felt uncomfortable all the week. I should
prize such a proof of your sympathy with your friend, but he would
regret any discomfort to you. 1 have had some gout, I believe, and
am glad to believe, for you know I regard gout as a remedy, not a
disease. Therefore, I merely take pains to prevent its being more dis-
agreeable than is necessary. I am not such a fool as to try to cure it of
doing me good. But if I could have been tempted into the folly, it would
have been by a charming request which I received from a lady friend
to try a French medicine she was so good as to send me. Her brother-
in-law, she said, had long suffered from the gout, but had taken the
medicine for three years. Now he swears by it. "Previously," she
adds, "he swore differentiy." Was it not clever, and worth having the
gout for P Don't j ou wisli her brother-in-law's name was Mann P
My poor dear Pans! Do not ask about it, for I have no heart to
write on the subject,. Imagine that once brilliant city without any gas
at night. I think that mutt be the most depressing feature in the
whole horrid business. Paris without light! But now we hear that
all is prepared fur a hideous illumination, and that Notre Dame is
marked out as a target for the bombs. I will not believe it, but I oan
give you no reason for my unbelief, except that the idea is too shocking.
Of course, I easily reason myself into conviction that we have nothing
to do with the matter—tu V as routu, Georges Dandin; but secretly I
feel as if I were some kind of accomplice in a crime. Luckily, London
is in no danger of such a state of things. We have no fortifications,
and, as Lord EIIesmere said, it the enemy should march in at one end,
the best thing the Guards could do would be to march out at the
other.
You insist on having our twopenny local news, though what you do
with it is as great a mystery to me as that which the old bear Dr.
Johnson's satellites found in his coMeeting bits of orange-peel. Oan
you comprehend such trash being written down, by the way P Yea,
you may, for in these days ten thousand times worse twaddle is written
as biography of men who have not a quarter the old bear's title to
respect. Apropos of bears, I may as well say, that we are not going
to fight Russia because her circular was ill-mannered. Between poor
fanatic Cowper and myself there is not much in common, but he wrote
good verses, and here are two very much to the purpose:—
'1 Am I to set my life upon a throw.
Because a Bear is rude and surly * No."
But I was going to tell you that our London School Board has
elected a Chairman, and you know him, so do millions. Sir, the ex-
Governor-General of India, Lord Lawrence, was chosen by a great
majority. He was reasonably safe, being a Lord, but I was afraid that,
the additional qualification of being a noble, simple-hearted, high-
minded man, with great administrative power, might tell against him.
It would have done so in most assemblies, but this Board is a picked
Parliament. He is a staunch Churchman, so they chose a staunch
Dissenter as Vice-Chairman. India seems triumphant. That Metro-
politan Board chose Colonel Hogg, son of Sir James, as their chief.
He has always been a favourite with them, and when he rose at the
same time as another speaker, there was invariably a shout of "Ear
Ogg." I hope Bashan will be loyal and obedient to its King.
I see that in America they have been playing As You Like It, and by
way of strengthening the cast have put in Mr. James Mace, pugilist,
as the Wrestler. Bat Orlando throws him, to the exceeding rage of
the rowdies, who attend only to behold the bruiser. It is suggested
that to please them, the manager should let him have another adver-
sary, whom he might maul terribly, and thus please everybody. Of
course, no manager has any knowledge of Shakspeare except from the
Sixpenny Acting Edition, or the course would be clear. Charles, the
wrestler, before the struggle with Orlando, has thrown three brothers,
maiming them for life, and their father is described as wailing over
them, and making the bystanders weep. This might be shown. I should
be sorry to see the name of Mrs. Scott Siddons, a lady of merit, mixed
up with such a "revival "—if anything in this world mattered.
The dear old Pope is amusing himself characteristically. There are
about four thousand doors in the Vatican, and he amuses himself, quite
harmlessly, by pervading the place, and unlocking and looking the
doors for hours. I suppose this is to persuade himself that he has still
the power of the keys.
Do you ever amuse yourself with rat-fighting f O, my dear Sir, you
need not look so indignantly, though your sister says it becomes you
so well. We fight rats in London. Mr. Knox, the excellent magis-
trate at Bow Street, had a case before him the other day, and was
asked to consider that turning a hundred rats into a pit, that they
might bite and be bitten by a poor bewildered dog, who had to be
fomented and cherished up to his work, was a legitimate way of
destroying noxious animals. He could not see this, nor can I. But
how a rat is killed is not so much to the point as what the persons
should be done with who pay to see and who enjoy such a spectacle.
Chief Justice Cockburn is an admiration of mine. Seldom more so
than when he snubs an absurd jury. There has been a tremendously
long libel case before him—a philanthropic attorney—there are such
beings, it seems, to prove to us that Hamlet was right about Horatio's
philosophy—published vehement things against the ex-master of a
workhouse. Justification was pleaded, and it was sought to show that
the ex-official deserved the comments. The Chief Justice dwelt
strongly upon the alleged cruelties in the workhouse. But the jury
gave the master £600. "I shall stay execution," said Sir Alexander.
If the jurymen understood—but how should they understand—all that
his Lordship meant, they might not have snored comfortably that night.
But " a wise man's speech sleeps in a juror's ear."
Your friend was at a wedding the other day. I could not help it, of
that you may be sure. You do not know the people, but you can
understand a somewhat elderly and plain young lady, with Sir
Hugh Evans' " good gifts" multiplied by twenty at least, wedding a
dashing young horse cither, who had not previously shown himself
blind to beauty. That happens often, you will say. Your remark is
just, Sir Horace. But it does not often happen that a perfervid young
wedding guest, from Cambridge, inspired by goblets of high-coloured
champagne, and the smiles of bridesmaids (coloured or not I could not
say) should insist on supplementing a toast with a song, and should
shout forth a canticle known as the Bold Dragoon, a story of a soldier
who having nothing but his boldness and his long sword, saddle,
bridle, whack! did marry a rich woman, and speedily bury her, and
tonch ten thousand pound. The poor lad was far too exalted to com-
prehend the situation he had created, but the family butler fainted
into an ice-pail, as the singer smote his manly limb, and cried
"Whack" with a voice that made the glasses ring. I thought the
young Cantab took his pons asiaorum in style.

EPISCOPAL COOKERY.
Cookery is a solemn—bat we have hitherto scarcely regarded it as a
sacred thing. For those who lower the Great Art to a level with
Music, Painting, Oratory, and so forth, we have nothing but pity.
But the line must be drawn somewhere. We did not expect to receive
an Episcopal certificate to the merits of a Cork artist. Yet here is
one, taken from an Irish journal:—
THE OPENING AND CONSECRATION OP ST. FINN BABRE'S NEW
CATHEDRAL, CORK.
THOMAS ,T. » * * * * Practical Cook and Confectioner, having had
the honour of fulfilling a prolonged and important engagement with the
Lord Bishop of Cork and Mrs. Greoo, who have entertained in a style of
munificent eleganoe the highest dignitaries of the Church, the elite of the
county and English metropolis, previous and subsequent to the opening of the
above noble and magnificent edifice, respectfully announces his return from
the Palace, Cork, to his residence, &c., &c.
"REMEMBER, REMEMBER, THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER."
To an observant reader the daily catalogue of Marriages in the Times
presents many amusing peculiarities, such as the enumeration of the
various Clergymen employed—particularly if an Ex-Colonial Bishop
chances to head the list—the disclosure of the bride's pet name in the
family circle, the notice of the bridegroom being the great-great-
nephew of the late Sir Brien MacTapfie, Knt., and so on; but
nothing, perhaps, of late years has surpassed the oddity of a newly
arrived announcement of a colonial wedding having taken place "on
Guy Fawkes Day." We could have understood a young couple select-
ing Lady Day, or May Day, or Valentine's Day, for the celebration of
their nuptial rites, and giving it special prominence in the advertise-
ment; but why anybody should feel proud of being married on Guy
Fawkes Day is hard to understand, unless the connection of that amiable
conspirator with matches explains the difficulty. Perhaps, after all,
the whole thing is a hoax—a squib—and will receive a positive
contradiction.
Our Best Foreign Policy.
Mrs. Malaprop, having heard of the Russian difficulty created by
Prince Gortschakofp's Circular, remarked that she hoped Govern-
ment would concoct no more of those good-for-nothing Treatises with
Foreign Powers.

SUSCEPTIBLE STUDENTS.
A memorial, complaining of the admission of ladies to the classes of
certain teachers in the School of Surgery, signed by sixty-six medical
students, has been presented to the Royal College of Surgeons, Edin-
burgh. The memorialists allege, amongst other grievances:—" That
the presence of women at the classes of Anatomy and Surgery, and in
the dissecting-rooms of the College, gives rise to various feelings which
tend to distract the attention of the students from important subjects of
study." The youths who make this statement, speaking for themselves,
doubtless say what is true, but it is difficult to imagine what the
"various feelings," occasioned by the presence of women in dissecting
rooms, and at anatomical and surgical classes, and tending to distract
men's attention, can be. Admiration of female minds superior to
frivolity, and occupied in high and useful studies, ought to be one of
the feelings thereby occasioned. But that would hardly distract male
students' attention. As to any more ardent emotion of a specific kind,
if they are affected with that by the presence of female students in
dissecting, and anatomical, and surgical lecture-rooms, so probably
they are also in hospital-wards by the presence of sisters and nurses.
What very susceptible young men they must be! How will they ever

An unusual, if not unhe&rd-of kind of thing has occurred.
The Pall Mall announces that:—
"The Lords of the Admiralty have, in oTder to show their
approbation of the general good conduct of the different crews
of the ships composing the Channel Squadron, resolved that
the men belonging to Plymouth shall tiave leave (watch by
watch) to visit their friends at Christmas; and the same boon
will be granted to those who belong to Portsmouth and the
eastern ports, under like regulations."
Few people, probably, were ever more surprised in their

tells us that a generous and gracious thing has actually
been done by the Lords of the Admiralty!

HORSE-WORSHIPPERS HORRIFIED.
The extremities to which the Parisians have been reduced for food
by the siege of their city must appear peculiarly appalling to British
devotees of horse-worship. "Argus," in the Post, says :—
"From the very unfavourable accounts just received from France some
apprehensions are entertained as to the yearlings of Coont Lagrange, which
are advertised by Messrs. Tattkksall to be disposed of at the hammer in the
beginning of next month, being able to arrive here at the appointed time."
If they ever arrive at all, it will be well enough. Better late than
never. The yearlings of Count Lagrange, if still existing, possess a
property which must render their existence in France, and particularly
in Paris, just now, very precarious. Their flesh, as young horseflesh,
is, doubtless, horseflesh of special tenderness. The votaries who re-
sard the horse with sentiments like those which the ancient Egyptians
cherished for the ox Apis, and Indian Brahmins also contemplate a
bull with, must, considering the perilous position of Count Lagrange's
yearlings, naturally feel extremely apprehensive as to the safety of
those sacred animals.

AMERICAN OUTSPEAKING.
It is a great mistake to complain of the high-minded Gener al But-
ler, for proposing to entrap us into war, and we should not find fault
with the noble General Grant because he has recommended Congress
to act on General Butler's suggestions. On the contrary, we ought
to be very much obliged to the sometime Federal, but now, in relation
to ourselves, Confederate generals.
Butler and Grant, instead of openly and magnanimously threaten-
ing us with the hostility of the United States, might meanly and slily
have kept their intentions to do us a mischief to themselves, biding
their time. They might have said nothing about what they were going
to do, but waited until they should find us at war with some great
Continental Power, then meaning to do it. But no. They have taken
a leaf out of artless Bismarck's book—with a difference. Bismarck,
indeed, plainly tells those whom it may concern what he purposes, but
that information only warns them not to oppose him. It never enables
them to do or abstain from doing anything that can tend to prevent
him from effecting his designs. Now, the menaces of Butler and
Grant admonish ns to take care how we engage in a quarrel. Thanks
to those frank gentlemen, if we plunge into war with Russia, we shall
do it with our eyes open to the behaviour which we must expect from
our American kinsmen. We see with what wisdom we should act if,
at the instigation of Mr. Merriman and his democratic associates, we
should take up arms against Prussia, on the side of France, irrespec-
tively of right, in order to abet Republicanism.
Forewarned is forearmed; and our heartfelt acknowledgments are
due to the straightforward and aboveboard Grant and Butler.

Why is Civilisation like a Crab P The answer is almost too obvious
to be mentionable, but we will venture to say, "Because civilised
Europe is going backwards." On the other hand, uncivilised Europe,
that was, is making a degree of progress whereof the magnitude may
be inferred from the following news:—
"A Lady Lrctorino in Constantinople.—The Neologos of Constanti-
nople, of the 1st uut., says that in the first winter sitting of the flellenikos
Philologos Syllogos of Constantinople, Madame Dora d'Istria, an honorary
member, delivered a lecture, in Greek, upon epic poetry and the works of M.
Gervrsio. This is the first time that the City of the Sultan has seen a
literary entertainment in which a lady took the principal part."
The wonderful social changes likely to be wrought in Turkey by the
growing self-assertion of Woman, may be expected to result in nothing
less than the conversion of the Turks. Turkish women will endeavour
to vie with Greek in the display of their mental powers. They will
take to lecturing too, and, deriving ideas from intercommunication
with their English sisters, go on to occupy themselves with Penny
Readings and other High Intellectual Treats. By-and-by, strong-
minded Womanhood will have developed itself among the better half
of the Sultan's subjects. Fatima and Leila will harangue public
meetings in advocacy of Woman's Rights, and demand to be eligible
to a seat in the Divan, and the office of Grand Vizier. Seeing these
things,'and knowing that the Founder of their Creed never dreamt of
them, the Mussulmans will perceive that Mahomet was no prophet.
Thus a chink will have been made for the thin end of the Missionary
wedge. To make it is evidently, in Turkey, the mission of Woman.

AYRTON ON HIMSELF.
mittdio dispute whether the phy-
siognomical part of Phrenology
is true or fallacious, its nomen-
clature is handy. This, for in-
stance, enables us to understand
what Mr. Ayrton meant to say
for himself by certain remarks
which he made the other day in a
speech on the occasion of laying
the chief corner stone of the new
General Post Office.
He declared himself " happy to
say the Commissioners of Works,
in the design and construction of
the building, had not allowed
ideas of fancy or taste to be made
paramount to the demands of
public utility." The new build-
ing, he predicted, "will be a
remarkable illustration of the ad-
vantages to be derived from the
study of economy." He gloried
in proclaiming that the Board of
Works " was not engaged on this occasion in erecting a Grecian temple,
but a place of business ; and therefore had sought to subordinate archi-
tecture to convenience." Finally, he said, he "hoped that men of
sense would ratify the conclusion at which the Office of Works had
arrived in this matter, in rendering beauty and art subservient to public
convenience and utility."
Phrenologically considered, all this is tantamount to saying, "I am
deficient in Constmctiveness and Ideality; my Acquisitiveness is very
large: and my Self-Esteem also greatly preponderating over my sense
of beauty and predilection for building. I am proud as well as pleased
in being able to announce that fancy and taste will be sacrificed to
simply material and pecuniary utility. Probably there is a misprint in
the words "design and construction of the building." reported as Mr.
Ayeton's. Very likely "and" should have been 'for the." Other-
wise a Phrenologist might apprehend a deficiency of the reflective
faculties to have been indicated by speaking of the construction of a
building not as yet constructed.
In the hope expressed by Mr. A yrton for sensible men's ratification
of the resolve of his Board to subordinate beauty and art to meaner
objects, the Phrenologist would discern a degree of Love of Approba-
tion, dominated, however, by Self-Esteem aforesaid. It is not the good
opinion of everybody that Mr. A yet on cares for, but only that of
sensible men; that is to say, men whose Acquisitiveness, like his own,
exceeds their Constructiveness and Ideality.
When the Chief Commissioner of Works boasted that he was not an
JSdile, he uttered a vaunt which probably, the new Post Office,will prove
to have been not empty. There is no vKdileship involved in merely
laying a stone, even though it be the foundation of a Grecian Temple.
The tiling can be done without any more Constrnctiveness than Me.
Ayeton appears to have, and without any Ideality at all, which he also
prides himself on not having. But was there no Grecian Temple of
which the representative of the Tower Hamlets would have been
especially fit to lay the corner-stone f Had the Goddess of Convenience
no Temple P At any rate, we may suppose, there was a Temple of
Plutt/s. ,,

A SELECTION FROM THE VERY LATEST LETTERS OF THE HONOURABLE
HORACE WALPOLE, OF STRAWBERRY HILL, FAVOURED BY OUR
PRIVATE SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
To Sir Horace Mann.
Is our family coming into fame againP Judge you, my dear Sir,
when I tell you that among the blood horses sold the other day at
Tattersall's was "Robert Walpole" by "Prime Minister." This
shows an amount of historical knowledge one did not expect to find in
the stable. Some little jockey-boy must have left his Pinned about,
and his employers must have found it, and managed to spell out names.
You Continentals behave so decorously in the theatre, that you will
scarcely understand that in London it is the fashion with sundry
persons to chatter and jabber in private boxes, to the annoyance of the
audience and the disturbance of the actors. A few nights ago, one of
our cleverest leading actresses had to come down to the footlights, and
publicly complain that such interruptions, from a certain box, made it
impossible for her to do justice to her part. But vulgarians are not a
new invention. I remember seeing Madame Vestris, who was playing
Apollo in Midas, walk deliberately up to a box, in which sat a chattering
old she-creature in a turban, and sing point-blank at her, " I'ray.
Goody,please to moderate the rancour of your tongue" The audience
shouted the box-party out of the house. Aristocrat though I am, I
have no patience with aristocratic insolence; There is the excuse that
by audacious puffs and untruthful criticism folks may have been lured
to a play, said to be good, and they find it is bad. Then they can go
away, and not disturb those for whom it is good enough. No, Sir,
that is not quite an answer. They may not have ordered their carriage
for an hour or more. Besides, if a man sells me a rotten apple over
his counter, must I not say it is rotten for fear of annoying other folks
who are content to munch his trash? But the fact is, the sort of
people who make disturbances are the last people to know whether a
piece is good or bad, or if they knew earlier in the evening, they are
seldom competent to judge at the time they come in. The words of
Mercury would be harsh after the popping of the corks of Bacchus.
I wish the Pit would try a.bombardment, of oranges.
Marriage is not a matter that concerns me much. But I hear that folks
do marry, and are given in marriage, profusely. Too profusely, accord-
ing to a certain London Banking House. which has issued a ukase
announcing that any clerk wedding on a salary of less than £150 shall
be held, ipso facto, to have resigned. I do not see the force of the out-
cry that has been raised against the Bank. If a garotter is dragged to
gaol maudlin people say, "Ah, he is what society has made him;
society should have looked after him." But the moment this abominable
Society, which must mean Somebody, begins to exert a moral pressure
on anybody, there is a clamour. Surely it is a good thing to save
a person from trying to support himself, a wife (and her millinery),
servants, and children on less than sixty shillings a-week P Ten shillings
a day, leaving out Sundays! The extravagance of marrying on such a
sum seems to me shameful—were I a parson, I should say sinful. Why,
a Government clerk told me that his coat-flowers, for the morning, for
the Park, and for dinner (for yon must change your floralities, if you
are anybody) cost him five and sixpence a-day, and cab-hire as much
more. Do you wonder that mothers hesitate at consigning their
daughters to abject penury f
Talking of marriage, divorce lias suggested an odd thing. A lady
wants to be separated from her husband, and not having the funds (for
though we have made things as cheap as we can, the law's costly, as
Lord Sparlrisk says), she is giving public readings in order to raise the
expenses. I think that is a new feature in society. Perhaps, if one
had to arrange the programme. one might make the injudicious laugh.
The poor lady should read the Matrimonial Service, with commentaries
and illustrations of her sposo's forget fulness of his vows.
You are right, dear Sir, our love of scandal is one of the many bad
signs and tokens of the day. I do not want classic testimony to the
faith that when a nation is greedy to hear of the vices of its notable
5ersons that nation is in a bad way. Yet you will remember
'acitus :—
"Civitas rimandis offensis sagax."
Yes, we are fast g^oing to destruction, as I have told you many a time
and oft. At a dinner-table, the man who could give news from the
Georgium Sidus would be thought a bore compared to him who can
tell a new scandal, especially if it tends to damage the character of
somebody who was always supposed to be so good. The women, as
usual, win in a race handicapped by folly, and started by spite—out
you need not read this to your countesses.
Canning accused poor Lord Westmoreland of a glutinous adhesion
to office. Our public men cannot be charged with the use of gluten.
They are glad enough to get a holiday, for they are worked so merci-
lessly hard in these days. There is more to do, I suppose, than ever,
but statesmen have lost the invaluable art of letting things alone.
Quiet a non movere was my father's rule, and he was not the least wise
or successful of Ministers. The affectation of intense conscientious-
ness, and the desire to do everything oneself, make me smile. who have
seen a nation governed, and well governed, over a bottle of wine. and
by a council whence a good story was not exoluded. We left clerks to
do the work of clerks. All which is prelude to my mentioning that
Mr. Bright has resigned. He, however, is much too wise a man to
care for work merely for its own sake. He came into the Ministry for
pecial purpose, which was answered, and I am glad he is released,
u can tell your people, if you like, that Mr. Gladstone has resolved
'•T T >— » *r-J T \T 41 „

to go to war with Jerusalem and Madagascar, and North and South
Amerikee, and that Mr. Bright threw up office in consequence, but is
to have the Garter—or perhaps you had better say the Star of Indir.
George Selwyn quoted Pope neatly the other night. We were
dining at the Bedford, in Covent Garden, and there was a talk about
the eating of cats by the besieged in Paris. I, for one, do not believe
that an extra puss is devoured—culinary treason always did its worst in
that line when stewed rabbits were ordered. But George said:—
"Let them adore a cat on oysters fed:
I'll have a party at the Bedford Head."
They tell me 'tis Christmas, my dear Sir. I suppose it must be, for
everybody looks miserable, between indigestions and extortions. If
any one thing connected with it can make me happy, it is that you are
out of its enjoyments. Adieu! Horace Walpole.

OUR CHRISTMAS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
O you know Mr.
Punch, that at
length a sensible re-
mark has actually
been made in a pub-
lic speech on the
War? Fact,Sir. W.
Arthur Russell,
M.P., addressing
his constituents at
Tavistock, delivered
that speech. It is
not given to every-
body to wipe Mr.
Mill's eye. But
surely the Member
for Tavistock did,
thus:—
"Mr. Gladstone
has been blamed se-
verely by others for
not displaying mora
energy before the war
broke out, and for not
threatening with war
the first who broke
the peace of Europe.
But, Gentleme:
great Power like ISng-
'and must not threaten unless she is in earnest, and the French are not a people
who yield to threats—that policy would not have been successful. The French,
in July, were far too much excited to care for our menaces, or to believe that
we meant what we said; if, after that, to prove that we were in earnest we had
bombarded some of the peaceful commercial towns on the coast of France,
nobody would have been more shocked and horrified than
who first recommended that policy."
To be sure, Sir, we might have' said to the French and German
Governments, "We hold the first who strike* our foe," and then, when
France struck first, have held still. Nor would "civilised Europe"
have scoffed at and taunted us any more than it does. But civilised
Europe would have despised us in reality. The Czar would not merely
have tried aggression on. He would have quietly proceeded to rebuild
Sebastopol, and create a Russian fleet in the Black Ser. Bizzr, in
like manner, would have seized upon Luxemburg without the super
fluity of a warning, and then very likely have gone on to annex
Holland and Belgium as well.
As it is, we are spending a Christmas which is at least more season-
able than it would seem if we had burnt Boulogne and Havre for no
good, and more satisfactory than we should feel it if, by doing less than
nothing, after having swaggered, we had made ourselves ridiculous,
and incurred the unfeigned contempt of the Unscrupulous Powers.
That is the position we might have placed ourselves in. Then, there we
should have been; but now, at any rate, as the Clown (Wise Merry-
man) says, Here We Are!

A Hairdresser who can cut your hair without venturing to make
any cutting observations on it.
A waiter at a City dinner, whose white gloves are not big enough for

what she wants, and will not worry her to buy a dozen things she
doesn't want.
A Shakespeare commentator who will abstain from twisting simple
passages into thoroughly obscure ones.
An habitual criminal in the art of punning, who will avoid using a
word because he sees there is a joke in it.
A railway guard or porter of sufficient self-control to shut a carriage-
door without violently banging it.

WILLIAM THE SERIOUS.
The writer" of some verses made by Indignation and published in
the Pall Mall, abusing the Germans in a strain of vigorous invective,
asks them:—
What if he dealt the foremost blow,
Tour old, hereditary, foe!
What if his rath, unchastened hand
lit up the war- fires in the land!
To this demand the Germans might naturally enough, if not
poetically, reply :—
What? Why we '11 make it certain, then,
He ne'er shall do the like again.
Whether such certainty is attainable by means which must secure
the eternal hatred of France, is a question between the new Emperor
that is to be and his Chancellor. The pious King of Prussia, in the
meanwhile, is doubtless praying fervently for his enemies, whom at the
same time he endeavours to trample with all his might. He accom-
panies his sincere prayers on their behalf with the utmost exertions to
bring them to repentance.
WAR AT THE PRICE OF PEACE.
Prace at any price which is not,-in the end, dearer than the cost of
War. That should be the motto of every Briton, if all Britons were
equally taxed. It is the motto of every sane payer of Income-tax.
Very well, then. Had we not better pay the American Government
all the damages they demand in their Alabama Claims P Quite the
contrary. For, instead of purchasing peace by such a payment, we
should more likely incur war. A government capable of declining our
offer to submit those claims to arbitration is capable of any conduct
that can result from intellectual sharpness and moral idiotcy. If we
were to pay it the sum which it asks, we should pay it a great deal of
money. Money is the sinews of war. There would be nothing but the
fear of us to restrain the Government of Washington from picking a
quarrel with us on some fresh score, entrapping us into war with the
United States, and employing the funds which we had supplied them
with in carrying it on.

Justice could disappear from the consciousness of peoples. That the world

response was made other than by the porter, who stated that no higher
authority was at that moment in residence. Accordingly, the deputa-

CIGARETTE PAPERS.

No. VII.—MY MILITARY ACQUAINTANCE SMOKED OUT.
Y Military Acquaintance, Pip-
kin, is an expert at borrow-
ing small sums. This is the
only thing that I know very
much to his credit. He has
a knack of flourishing six-
pence and insisting upon his
paying his share of a shilling
cab-fare, which induces a be-
lief in his ability to make a
call upon a considerable sum
at his Banker's. But will it
come when he calls? I fancy
that if I offered fifty pounds
for Pipkin's assets Pipkin
would jump at it and be the gainer. He will borrow half a sove-
reign of you because he hasn't got change for a fiver. If you hap-
pen to have the required five sovereigns, he will have mislaid the
note and "forgotten what the deuce ne did with it." Half-erowns
and shillings he gets from his friends by ingenious tossing, at which
amusement he is singularly successful.
Pipkin puts on a very knowing look when the Derby is at hand.
He is perpetually asking what his acquaintances individually will "give
against" so and so, and will refuse their offer whatever it is with a wink
of such deep signification as leads those who do not know him to suppose
that Pifkin is a thorough turfite with a big book and the odds at his
fingers' ends. Of course he has not a'penny on it, and so far Pipkin
is wise.
Pipkin, my Military Acquaintance, has a mysterious way with him
in speaking of any lady, which has often imposed on the most astute.
He will point out some lady to you, and ask sotlo voce, "Do you see
her f eh P"
You will become deeply interested and will probably expect to hear
some thrilling tale, which, if known publicly, would show Society
rotten at the core.
You do see her, and you naturally say interrogatively " Well P"
looking for the interesting details.
Not a bit of it. Pipkin will simply wink, smile, say "Ah !" and
shake his head in the ambiguous manner which Hamlet anticipated his
friends would assume when keeping the celebrated Ghost Secret.
(Perhaps, by the way, Propessor Pepper once made similar remarks to
Mr. Dicks when the." Spectral Illusion" was first introduced to the
public.)
If pressed to reveal his knowledge, Pipkin will commence in your
ear, ,fWell," slowly, "I'll tell you." Then, after looking round to
see if no one is within earshot he'1l continue, "She was once"
Here he breaks off, as if he really must not commit a breach of confi-
dence, and adds, "No, I'd better not tell you." This of course leaves
his auditor to imagine whatever he likes, or does not like, as the case
may be, and the wary Pipkin has it always in his power to reply to
any charge, that he never said a single word against Mrs. Thingummy.;
but, for all that, he] is the best hand, and this is .the best method of
taking away a reputation, with which I am acquainted.
Pipkin will, of course, be kicked one of these days, and serve him
right. His amours would fill a volume—if told by himself—and he is
always ready to tell anybody who will listen, specially women. Natu-
rally, no woman of sense is to be taken in by Pipkin for one second,
and to see Pipkin, in his most fascinating mood, taken down several
pegs and snubbed by some lady, upon whom he was congratulating
himself that he had made a favourable impression, is worth more than
a trifle.
Well my Military Pipkin's familiarity means "an easy bearing," and
to him vulgarity is " good .breeding."
He is addicted to showing letters signed by various female Christian
names:—" Annie," " Sophy," " Milly, &c., to himself, three or four at a
time, and will extract tender passages in corroboration of his own account
of his own prowess. I fancy he writes some of these himself, perhaps
most of them. Yon can't please him more than by calling him a "Don
J uan," and if he can only meet you in the street when he has a petti-
coat on his arm, his happiness has reached its climax. If it was his
Grandmother, and she had her veil down, he would give one of his
winks aside at you, as'mucli as to say, "Ain't I a sly dog, eh P Another
conquest, Sir, another conquest." Pipkin is an ass, but not harmless;
no man who possesses his power of winking can be harmless. Pipkin,
when found out, is amusing, for a time, but after a while yon decide
that he is despicable, and will cease to find any source of mirth in his
love letters, his bombast, his sporting, or his military bearing. We
have chatted over our Cigarette: let as throw the bit of paper away,
and drop my Military Acquaintance.

BEETHOVEN AND THE BRITISH PUBLIC.
On the evening of Saturday last week the centenary of Beethoven was
celebrated atCovent Garden by the performance of Fidelio. "The house,"
says one who had paid for his admission, " was crowded, particularly
in the cheapest part. I was in the cheapest but one—the Amphitheatre
Stalls; should, if worth a thousand a year certain, have occupied a
Pit Stall; nay, perhaps the centre of a box, with a suitable companion
on either side of me. The people encored the overture first played—
to wit, Leonora. They listened most attentively to the whole perform-
ance from beginning to end." Now, Fidelio is an opera of which the
interest does not consist in sympathy with vice. Beethoven was not
the composer to write music descriptive of breaking the Seventh Com-
mandment. On the contrary, in Fidelio he glorifies conjugal loyalty—
worthily, both by voice and acting, expressed by Titiens. The public
appreciation of a work founded on the basis of sentiments proper to
Man (especially Woman), and not at all on that of the nature which
mankind share with apes and the rest of the lower animals, appears to
me a cheering indication. It is a symptom of progress, though partial,
which may afford some little comfort to melancholy persons, disgusted
and disheartened by the scene of brutality and backwardation at pre-
sent generally exhibited by the surrounding world.
Educational.
If Miss Garrett, is at any future time elected to the Chair of the
Education Board, her official position will be recognised by the title of
"Chairwoman" (as "Charwoman" pronounced), in wiuch„capacity
she will employ, let .us hope, the newest brooms.
SCIENCE GOSSIT.
Spraking of edible birds'-nests, it was the remark of an acute and
far-seeing naturalist, that the Swallow makes them and the Chinese
swallow them.
