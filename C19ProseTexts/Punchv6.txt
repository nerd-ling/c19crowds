PREFA.cE.
Punch,
Even as the farmer's wife, shaking in her apron the cereal
grains, bringeth all sorts of fowl about her—now calling to
cocks and hens, and now with her supper-voice charming doves |
and pigeons from cot and roof–now making some distant goose
give forth a hopeful gaggle, and now evoking even from ducks
a hilarious quack,--even so hath Punch, shaking his purse of a
hundred guineas to all men with pens—a Hundred Guineas, the
reward of a Prize Preface to this his Sixth Volume — brought
around him every sort of quill, now fluttering with hope, now
tremulous for gold !
Alas! why cannot the resemblance continue ! Why, like
the aforesaid farmer's wife, cannot Punch shower liberal handfuls
to all? Why hath he no more than One Hundred Guineas for one
successful bird? In truth, if Punch, as his old friend Brutus once
hinted, could
“Coin his heart and drop his blood for drachmas,”—
he would have more than enough to satisfy all comers. His
sympathies are unfathomable; but though deep, his pocket has a
bottom. -
"Otherwise, how would he cast about him the golden grain to
the quills stained to attempt the Prize Preface He would throw

a handful even to that gray old goose—an ex-minister. He would not withhold some women. from yonder jackdaw,
plump and glossy as he is with comfortable roosting in a church-tower; he would even scatter the grain to that flamingo, a
field-marshal:—and how would he shower it down among the small birds that with timid, trembling wings, have answered
to the call of “PREFACE '" But PLuTus is a tyrant, and permits Punch to give only One Hundred Guineas to one
successful quill.
Prefaces, multitudinous as snow-flakes, have dropt into our letter-box. They have all been read by the Judicial
Committee—whose names are given in the last page—and the Prize declared. We are happy to state that we have received
the permission of the writers to print the effusions herewith presented to the reader. A thousand others have passed into the
purifying flames.
Each Preface was sent with simply a motto, or quotation, to distinguish it. The selection being made, we now—with the
consent of each writer—give his name.
LORD BROUGHAM AND WAUX.
“Rude AM I IN speech.”—Shakspere.
PUNCH herewith publishes his Sixth Volume. If he were given to boast, amplify, exaggerate, accumulate, or heap
words on words to his own glorification, he might here observe that he, above all men, has been the public's friend. That
in the street or out of the street, orally or in print, sleeping or waking, eating or temperately drinking, his one, sole,
single thought has been for the benefit of human nature, and never, directly or indirectly, for the base, foul, fetid soul-
destroying threepence (fourpence stamped) at which his weekly sheet is given—(he may, indeed, looking at what it contains,
say given)—to universal mankind. Punch might boast, but he never does! No ; even his worst enemies—and he is proud
to say he has enemies—the mean, the malignant, the envious, the crass, the wicked, and the corrupt—cannot lay their hands
upon those hollow, burnt-out cinders, their hearts, and charge Punch with boasting. Neither can he fawn or glozel But this
he can do—he can, when it suits his purpose, rail at all people the same, and, like a human cameleon, forswear every
shade of opinion, when for the moment he has ceased to wear it.
DUKE OF WELLINGTON.
“I should BE MAD To white A PREF Ace.”—Wellington's Speeches, slightly improved.
“FIELD-MAnshal, PUNch presents his Sixth Volume to the Public. FIELD-MARshAL PUNch believes it to be an
admirable Volume—his best yet. If, however, the Public think differently, why, the Public are welcome to do so."
SIR, ROBERT PEEL.
“MASTER SURECARD, As I Think P”—Shakspere.
Punch, in presenting his Sixth volume to the consideration of the world, may be allowed to look proudly back at
his career. If, in the course of his public life, he has now and then altered his opinion, he has never done so but, as
he conceived, for his own benefit. Neither has he, with a false and squeamish modesty, refused to avail himself of the
measures of any man, or any set of men, when—time and place altered—he has deemed them conducive to his own
advantage. He has levied a slight tax upon the income of the nation, which has been joyously paid. He will, whatever
the nation may think to the contrary, continue to lay that impost. Having been “regularly called in " to prescribe for
John BuLL, he is determined to make the most of his appointment. God save the QUEEN, and no money returned
!

PRIZE PREFACE. ve
BENJAMIN D’ISRAELI, Esq., M.P.
“YouNg BEN he was A Nice YouNG MAN.”–Hood.
All great deeds have been achieved by young men. PUNch—as literary PUNch—is, with his Sixth Volume, only
three years old; yet what has he not accomplished ? He hath taken the hearts of the nation captive | He hath, by his
downright singleness of purpose—by his invincible yearnings for all that was pure, and genial, and actively benevolent in
the spirit and institutions of the olden day—awakened throughout Great Britain a soul that is now wrestling with the
craft, and sordidness, and miserable egotism of the mere money-changers. Under the influence of Punch, John Bull,
like a wrinkled viper, will cast his skin, and—erultans in suis viribus—become YouNo MastER Engi,AND. PUNch is only
another of the long line of illustrious youth who, at certain seasons, have been sent for the world's health and progress.
Look at Gangantua when he was only one day old ! Consider Masten Betty when he numbered only eleven years!
Forget not HERCULEs in his cradle ! Ponder upon CLARA Fishen at Drury Lane–Giulio RegoND1 at all the concert
rooms—and the MastERs Collins, with their fiddles, at the Adelphi: Jack the Giant-Killer in times past—and the Boy
Jones of the present generation! All these names bear witness to the power of youth: and it is youth, and youth alone,
that has given to Punch the sovereignty he now holds !
It has been remarked by the surpassing author of the brilliant Coningsly, that the world, although it dreams not
of the glory, is at the present time governed by the Hebrew mind! Punch can bear testimony to the fact. Once Punch
wanted money. Who lent it him at sixty per cent.”—a Jew. Who sued him on the bill?—a Jew Who arrested him?
—a Jew! Who sold him up 7—a Jew! These, however, are common events. The world, however, will be startled to
learn that Punch himself—witness his nose—is a Jew! With this truth made manifest, truly, indeed, did the eloquent
and deep-thoughted author of Coningsby declare that the world was “governed by the Jewish mind.” We shall publish
Our next volume in Hebrew.
LORD WILLIAM LENNOX.
“Jack Sheppann is a Thief, but he NEven told A Lie.”—Ainsworth.
This is Punch's Sixth Volume. It has cost us much labour, but the labour we take pleasure in gives medicine
to annoyance. It is true we labour all the week, but how sweet is our repose on Sundays Then with village maids we
stray, where lo! the gentle lark sings most musical, most melancholy. Then returning to home, sweet home, with the
pearls upon our brow, we sit us down and tell strange anecdotes of the deaths of kings. "Twas ever thus with us in
childhood's hour; and, feeling that the boy is the parent of the adult animal, thus shall we proceed. We have finished
our Sixth Volume. To-morrow to fresh meadows and clover new In six months more we shall say of our volumes, in
the touching words of the poet,-‘‘We are half-a-dozen and one.”
JAMES SILK BUCKINGHAM, Esq.
“WANTED, A LaRae House, Hannsomely FuRNished, in one of the Squames.”—Daily Advertisements.
Punch, having finished his Sixth Volume, calls upon the gratitude of the public to do something for him; and, to
save all confusion, will state what he wants. Namely, a house in Portland Square, his own freehold, handsomely furnished;
cellar stocked with wines; an extensive library; and a liberal yearly income for condescending to accept the present. Direct
to Ponch's Office, Strand. N.B. There must be a back attic made for Punch's dear friend, Geonor Jones.

V1 PRIZE PREFACE.
GENERAL TOM THUMB.
“KINGS ARE PARTIAL To low CoMPANY.”—Burke.
This is our Sixth Volume. It is first-rate. It has, perhaps, one fault: it is printed, we guess, in too large a
type. We shall endeavour henceforth to print it in a type so tarnation small, that it will require rayther quick eyes to see
its face. Having done this, PUNCH hopes to go ahead, and so, from his extreme littleness, to become an immense favourite
at the Palace.
We have now to give the names of the Reading Committee, with their verdict.
3icating Cummittee:
LORD LYNDHURST, SIR. J. PARKE, Knt.,
LORD DENMAN, SIR JAMES FOLLETT, Knt.,
LORD COTTENHAM, SIR JOHN PATTESON, Knt.,

SIR. N. C. TINDAL, Knt., SIR. J. L. K. BRUCE, Knt.,
SIR. T. COLTMAN, Knt., SIR JAMES WIGRAM, Knt.
“We, the Reading Committee, appointed by PUNch to read the Prefaces to his Sixth Volume, sent in by
Candidates for the Prize of One Hundred Guineas, do hereby declare that the writer of the Preface with the quotation,
“Rude am I in speech,” is, in our opinion, entitled to the Prize, as containing the greatest amount of swagger in the
fewest possible syllables. In testimony whereof, witness our hands:—

“Lovegrove's, Blackwall, June 20th, 1844."
Upon this, Punch immediately handed over the Hundred Guineas to the fortunate writer, as will be seen from the

POLITICAL SUMMARY.
A* the commencement of the year 1844 the country was
generally thriving and peaceful, and the improvement of
trade, combined with an increasing revenue, reanimated the
spirits of the community, whose patience had been sorely tried
by want of employment, and its consequent depression.
The agitation for the Repeal of the Corn Laws had some-
what abated, although vigorously pressed by the League, and
there was scarcely any other subject of political excitement,
with the exception of Irish affairs. The trial of MR. O'Connell
and his associates was about to commence, and much anxiety
was felt both in England and Ireland as to the result. MR.
O'ConneLL was a very popular leader, and his conviction
might produce consequences which would require great firm-
ness on the part of the Government to turn to a profitable
account. The QUEEN's Speech was most congratulatory, and
referred to the good understanding which happily existed with
France and all other States. The treaty with China was
ordered to be laid on the table. The Scinde successes were
noticed, and the valour of the troops, both native and European,
fittingly acknowledged. The new Tariff was stated to have
produced great relief to the community, and the Revenue con-
sidered to be now equal to the Expenditure of the country;
but no allusion whatever was made to the Corn Laws. When
referring to Ireland, the QUEEN said:—“At the close of last
Session of Parliament I declared to you my firm determination
to maintain inviolate the Legislative Union between Great
Britain and Ireland. I expressed at the same time my earnest
desire to co-operate with Parliament in the adoption of all
such measures as might tend to improve the social condition
of Ireland, and to develop the resources of that part of the
United Kingdom"—adding, with marked emphasis—“I am
resolved to act in strict conformity with this declaration.”
LoRD ELDoN, in moving the Address, concluded his speech
by expressing a hope that the existing protection to agricul-
ture would be maintained, and hinted that legislative measures
were necessary for the prevention of duelling. Punch had
already made the practice appear ridiculous.
In the House of Commons MR. HUME moved an amendment
to the Address, in which he desired the House to implore HER
MAJESTY's gracious co-operation to repeal those prohibitory
and restrictive duties which pressed upon articles of great con-
sumption by the people, and at the same time to reduce the
civil, military, and naval establishments of the country.
MR. SHARMAN CRAwFoRD proposed to stop the Supplies until
inquiry had been made into the grievances of the people.
LoRD JoHN RUSSELL disapproved of both amendments, but
urged a low fixed duty on corn, upon which 40 per cent. was
now levied. The Opposition loudly cheered this statement.
SIR Robert PEEL replied, declaring that the new Tariff
worked most satisfactorily for the interests of the country. In
the course of his speech he said, referring to a remark of Lon D
John RUssell, “The noble Lord says we may maintain the
law or repeal it, but that it is impossible we should adopt a
fixed duty. Sir, I do not know exactly what may be im-
possible.” This declaration was received with cheers and
laughter, and was afterwards remembered. MB. HUME's
amendment was rejected by 186 against 49, and MR. CRAw-
Ford's by 285 against 29.
LoRD AsHLEY brought forward a motion relative to the
Ameers of Scinde, declaring their treatment to have been
unjust, and praying for their restoration to liberty and pro-
perty, or that provision for their future maintenance should
be accorded. Many painful statements were made both by
LoRD AsHLEY and MR. RoKBUCK, and the latter, referring to
pack

SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, denied his harsh treatment of the
Ameers, and said, “he had preferred the hard fare of a tent
to their luxurious palaces. This was conduct which would be
regarded as characteristic by those who knew the combination
of daring bravery and of kindness almost feminine which
distinguished that gallant officer, in whom was united the
courage of a lion and the gentleness—the heart—of a child.”
This just estimate of SIR. C. NAPIER was received with loud
cheers. The motion was lost by 202 to 68. Motions for the
thanks of Parliament to SIR C. NAPIER were brought forward
in both Houses of Parliament, and the DUKE OF WELLINGTON
spoke in the most complimentary manner of SIR CHARLEs.
During the debate CoMMODoRE CHARLEs NAPIER narrated
some anecdotes of the General's exploits in times past. The
number of bayonets at Meeanee were only 1700 as opposed to
30,000 of the enemy, and it was only surprising that the British
force had not been driven into the Indus. The nullah at Hyder-
abad was 40 feet wide and 17 deep. SIR CHARLEs, mounted
on his horse, Red Rover, was the second to ascend the bank,
and the men in their excitement carried their horses through,
and went “far beyond hunting in Leicestershire.” Had SIR
CHARLEs waited twenty hours longer he would have been
surrounded by fifty or sixty thousand men, as on the evening
after the battle twelve thousand fresh troops of the enemy
arrived at Hyderabad. In the House of Commons LoRD
How ICK took exception to SIR CHARLEs's treatment of the
Ameers, but the motion was ultimately agreed to by 164 to 9.
On the 21st of April, in reply to a question put by MR. T.
B. MACAULAY, SIR Robert PEEL announced that the Court
of Directors “had exercised the power which the law gives
them to recall at their will and pleasure the Governor-
General of India” (Lord ELLENBoRough). The announce-
ment was received with loud cheers by the Opposition, as
it was known that the Government had been strongly
opposed to the recall.
In the House of Lords the DUKE of WELLINgtoN severely
censured the act of the Board of Directors, and declared that
it had been done in opposition to the wishes of the Govern-
ment, and that the conduct of LoBD ELLENBoRough had his
entire approbation. There the matter dropped, but was resumed
the next day, and all papers referring to the correspondence
between the Board and the Ministry were refused in both
Houses. MR. RoeBUCK, by a motion, proposed to inquire
into the conduct of SIR. C. METCALFE, the Governor of Canada,
but SIB Robert PEEL and LoRD STANLEY defending the
course pursued, the discussion terminated without a division.
LoRD NoHMANBY called the attention of the House to the
affairs of lreland, and referring to the O'Connell arrests,
proposed to take the earliest opportunity when no prejudice
could arise therefrom in the minds of the jury, to examine
into the causes of the discontents now unhappily prevalent in
Ireland. The Government did not oppose LoRD NokMAN BY's
arguments, and the debate terminated in rather a sharp per-
sonal altercation between LoRDS BROUGHAM and CAMPBELL.
[The “Terrific Combat.” at St. Stephen's.] On a division
there appeared Non-contents 175, Contents 78, Majority
against, 97.
LoRD JoHN RUSSELL moved for a Committee of the whole
House, to consider the state of Ireland, and the debate
continued for nine nights. SIR JAMEs GRAHAM lead the
defence of the Government, but our space forbids the briefest
summary of the various speeches on the occasson, and which
were of a most interesting character. SIB Robert PEEL
declared that the Irish Parliament had been the most cor-
rupt that ever existed, and so MR. GRATTAN described it;
yet during its continuance MR. O'Conn ELL declared the hap-
piness of Ireland was almost perfect, though for the last
twenty years of its time there had been a constant series of
insurrections. [Jack the Giant-Killer.] He, SIR Robert
PEEL, defended the course pursued by the Government to-
wards the agitators, and hoped the time would come when
by the sacrifice of those evil passions that dishonour our
common faith, nothing would prevent the union of hand and
heart for the welfare of our common country. On a divi-
sion, the numbers were, for the motion 225, against 334,
majority for the Ministers, 99.
The Registration of Voters Bill was then brought in, and a
new measure to amend the Irish Municipal Franchise, which
were after discussion postponed, and finally lost on an Amend-
ment by MR. T. DUN.com BE; later in the Session, MR. HUME
moved to abolish the office of Viceroy of Ireland, but ulti-
mately withdrew the motion. Other Irish measures occupied
the attention of Parliament, and the Roman Catholic Penal
Acts Repeal Bill, introduced by LORD BEAUMONT, and sup-
ported by the Government, was carried. SIR JAMES GRAHAM's
Bill for Restrictions on Labour in Factories, after several
divisions on amendments by LoRD AshLEY, was passed, his
Lordship's proposal to limit the hours of labour to ten having
been rejected for the longer period. The objects of the Bill
were thus stated by LoBD WHARNCLIFFE: it alters the age at
which children may be admitted to work in factories from
nine to eight years; diminishes the working time of persons
between eight and sixteen years of age from nine to six and a
half hours, extends school hours to two and a half hours
in summer and three hours in winter, besides other salutary
provisions for the well-being of the operative.
LORD BROUGHAM spoke against the Bill, but was now gene-
rally to be found acting with the Government. [“Henry "
asking for more] and [the Ruined Gamester.]
Free Trade and the Corn Laws occupied but a small portion
of the attention of the House, and the exertions of their advo-
cates were confined to two or three desultory motions, more as
indicating their protest against the existing law than tending
to any practical result. MR. CoBDEN, however, on the 15th
of March, brought forward the Corn Law question, and the
same arguments pro and con as had been used on former
occasions were again advanced, and the motion lost by 224
to 133.
On the 25th of June, MR. WILLIERs brought forward his
motion on the Corn Laws, and condemnatory of the late Act,
and after various speeches on both sides the question, the
motion was lost by 328 to 124. It is well to remember the
largeness of these majorities.
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER gave a favourable
account of the Finance of the past year, but a majority
of 20 against the Sugar clause of the Government Customs
Bill (on an Amendment by MR. MILEs) created much anxiety
in the minds of Ministers, and SIR R. PEEL explained that
the Government would be embarrassed if the Budget was
materially altered. This LoRD JoHN RUSSELL declared to be
no more nor less than asking the House to retract its former
vote, and disgrace itself with the country, and the House
might be sure that if they gave him the victory now, they would
henceforth be wholly in his hand. The House, however, did
reverse their former decision by a Government majority of 22,
and the Bill subsequently passed a third reading.

page
In our last volume we gave an account of the progress of
the Irish State Trials up to the end of the year, when a true
bill had been found by the Grand Jury against MR. O'Con-
NELL and his associates. On the 15th of January the trial
was resumed, after various pretexts for delay. The trial
occupied twenty-four days, and during its progress MR. SMITH,
the Irish Attorney-General, challenged MR. FitzGIBBON to a
80 duel. [An Irish Mode of “Challenging a Jury.”] The
Page
matter was amicably settled by the intervention of friends. &
On the 30th of May sentence was pronounced against the 110
traversers, and O'Conn ELL was fined £2000, and bound in his
own recognizances in the sum of £5000, with two sureties of 248
£2500 each, to keep the peace for seven years, in addition to
one year's imprisonment.
We shall have occasion to refer again to this subject in our
succeeding Volume.

169 Who is to be Chief Baron P-SIR FREDERICK Pollock
was selected for that office.
169 The Polka Mania broke out in 1843.
169 Theatrical Intelligence.—MR. WIMBUSH, a horsedealer
in Oxford Street, started an omnibus to run from the Edge-
ware Road to the Bank without stopping to take up passengers.
It was not supported by the public.
170 Literary Intelligence.—See ante, p. 95.
171 The Giant and the Dwarf-ToM THUMB used to appear
dressed as NAPOLEON.
186 The Potato Panic proved to be too well founded before
the close of the year.
187 Atrocious Cruelty in Newgate.—MARY FURLEY, aged
40, threw herself and child into the Regent's Canal. The
child was drowned, and it was proved at the inquest and trial
that MARY FURLEY had suffered extreme distress. The other
facts of the case were as stated in the article by Q.
188 Advertising Barristers.-MR. WILKINs was counsel for
MR. BARBER in a most remarkable will forgery case. MR.
BARBER was transported and suffered great hardships. Sub-
sequently he was found to be innocent, and received a free
pardon. Government voted him about £5000 as compensation,
1860.
206 The Statue of Byron has not been set up in Poets'
Corner.
209 Lord Campbell's Bill for abolishing arrest for debt on
mesme process became law.
212 Chunee the Second.—LORD ELLENBOROUGH was known as
the “tame elephant,” and had been recently recalled from
India. Chunee, the elephant at Exeter Change Menagerie,
had been shot by his keepers in the year 1826.
228 A Caw from the Rookery.—A part of St. Giles's parish
was called “the Slums” and “the Rookery.” It was
tenanted by thieves and outcasts of London, and was pulled
down to make room for New Oxford Street.
231 Five Minutes with Jones.—Jon ES was an adventurer
who had written a mass of nonsense under the title of Tecumseh.
He brought an action for libel on the letter which appears in
this article, and declared it to be a forgery. He abandoned
proceedings and ultimately paid the costs of Punch, Jones's
authorship of the letter having been fully established.
Der Freyschütz at the Haymarket.—MR. WEBSTER
produced the Taming of the Shrew without scenery, merely
using tapestry and placards as in the time of SHAKSPERE.
Young England's “Old Nobility.”—The lines here
quoted have been used against their author on many occasions,
and with very damaging effect. His Lordship has referred to
them as a “mistake of youthful enthusiasm.”
Rules to be Observed, &c.—The EMPEROR NICHOLAs
arrived in England June 1st, and returned again on the 9th of
the same month. He was received with much ceremony by
the Court, and the late DUKE of DEvoNshi RE (formerly our
Ambassador to Russia) entertained him with great splendour
at Chiswick. On Monday, June 2nd, the EMPEROR visited
STORR AND MoRTIMER's, the celebrated Silversmiths and
Jewellers of Bond Street, and made purchases to the amount
of £5000. He subscribed 500 guineas yearly for a piece of
plate, to be run for at Ascot Races, and which was con-
tinued until the Crimean War. This piece of plate was
called the Emperor's Cup. Mr. Punch refused to receive the
EMPEROR.
Strange Insult to the King of Saxony.—The KING
of SAxon Y arrived on the same day as the EMPERoR of
RUSSIA, but very little notice was taken of him until the
departure of NICHOLAs.
The Holborn Montem is a parody of the Eton Montem,
which was formerly held at Salt Hill. We believe the last
took place in 1844.
Wested Rights of the Pea and Thimble.—See ante, 88.
The Dream of Joinville.—PRINCE Joinville's pamph-
let on the Invasion of England had been recently published
and laughed at.
The Industrious Fleas were a collection of about a dozen
of those familiar insects, trained to draw carriages, and to act
as chargers to various celebrities. Among others, the EMPE-
RoR NAPOLEoN was represented. They were exhibited in
Regent Street for some time.

THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.
On the 6th of January, 1522, King James ſº riding out on horseback
after dinner, pitched head foremost into the New River. Nothing could
be seen but the soles of his Majesty's boots. Sir Richard Young, who
was close to the king, obeying the impulse of humanity, pushed one of

order to the Loudon Docks in the morning; and the best-informed historians are of opinion

a great deal of milk will be

YEs, yes, it’s very true, and very clear !
By way of compliment and common chat,
It’s very well to wish me a New Year ;
But wish me a new hat
Although not spent in luxury and ease,
In course a longer life I won't refuse ;
But while you're wishing, wish me if you please,
A newer pair o' shoes |
Nay, while new things and wishes are afloat,
I own to one that I should not rebut—
Instead of this old rent, to have a coat
With more of the New Cut !
O yes, ’tis very pleasant, tho’ I’m poor,
To hear the steeple make that merry din;
Except I wish one bell was at the door
To ring new trowsers in.
To be alive is very nice indeed,
Although another year at last departs;
Only with twelve new months I rather need
A dozen of new shirts.
Yes, yes, it's very true and very clear,
By way of compliment and common chat,
It's very well to wish me a New Year,
But wish me a new hat l
THE OJIBBEWAY INDIANS,
These illustrious foreigners have had an audience of the Queen,
but the report that has appeared in the papers is not so correct as,
by our peculiar resources, we are able to render it.
On their arriving at Windsor, the porter, in his red and gold
livery, was hailed with a most unanimous whoop of delight from
the whole party. They declared they had come expecting to see
the great Mother, as they called the Queen, but that they had found
the great grandfather Sykes, the porter, who was instantly converted
into a sort of Maypole, round which the party went through one of
their national war dances—occasionally illustrating some Indian
manoeuvre by pokes with their tomahawks, and evolutions with their
scalping-knives. Sykes, who was glad enough to get rid of them,
handed them over to one of the pages, who ran up the great stair-
case with the whole tribe at his heels, indulging in one of their
national yells, which, however interesting to the enthusiast for
knowledge, was excessively disagreeable to the domestic whose duty
it was to usher the party into the presence of royalty.
The moment the Ojibbeways got into the apartment where the
Queen was expecting them, Ah-que-we-zaintz (“the boy,” as the in-
terpreter called him, though he was above 70 years old, and looked
just such a boy as Mathews must have alluded to when he said,
“That boy will be the death of me”) made the following very
strong observations, which we give in all their native strength and
purity.
Whackr ou ded ow fold eroded id dle rowd ed ow tolderiddelr
ido.
It was explained to her Majesty that “the boy” merely meant to
say, that he was too unwell to say anything.
The War-chief then made a few remarks in Ojibbeway, which
were translated into gibberish by Strong-wind—who called himself
the interpreter—and from that it was done into English by the Hon.
Mr. Murray, who has got a smattering of Ojibbeway, and intends, we
believe, bringing out an Ojibbewese Grammar, as soon as he has got
it ready for publication.
The War-chief was understood to say, that he was glad to see the
faces of the English all wearing pleasant looks; upon which her
Majesty observed, that “the gentleman in the beads and feathers
could not have seen a Tax-collector, or he would not have described
all the English faces as pleasant.” The War-chief alluded to the size
of her Majesty's wig-wam—the name he was pleased to bestow on
Windsor Castle. When the Queen good naturedly suggested, that
“if it was any wan, it was a Tory and not a Whig wan, since the
change in the ministry.”
The War-chief remarked, also, that the light which came into the
windows was of a good quality—whereupon the Queen humorously
observed, that “the light ought to be good, considering the very good
price that the people had to pay for it.” The War-chief then gave a
very broad hint which was not taken. He remarked that presents
had been often sent them from this country—but her Majesty having
"| no loose cash about her, did not act upon the suggestion of Pattona-
quotta-weebe, for such was the name of the unfathomable and
venerable rasper (deep old file) who had been addressing her.
The party then went through several of their dances, in which
Weenish-ka-weebe—the “FLYING Gull.”—greatly distinguished
himself.
We are sorry that the Ojibbeways are so hard up, as to be reduced
to public exhibition at so much a head—for we should feel the
degradation deeply, if any of our English warriors were abroad in the
same predicament. Fancy the Duke of Wellington and the Marquis
of Anglesey finding themselves short of cash somewhere at the other
end of the world, and performing the broad-sword exercise before an
audience of native Indians, for the purpose of paying their expenses
home again. Or, suppose it possible that any of our Royal Family
should get out to Ojibbeway, and go through the dances of their
country—a Scotch reel, an Irish jig, or an English naval hornpipe,
for the amusement of the court people. Such, however, appears to
be the degrading position, in this country, of the chiefs of the tribe
of the Ojibbeway Indians, if we may judge from the announcements
of Mr. Catlin, wherein it is stated that “The Ojibbeway Indians
exhibit daily. War-whoop at 12 precisely; Scalping begins at 3.
Feeding time, ls, extra.”

any of the Under-graduates remain in Oxford
during vacation, “to read Ethics with a Fellow of the
College.”—(See letters to Papa); although how they
effect this by residing at Bicester, with four hunters
and a hack, is mot immediately evident.
Romanism continues to make awful advance. Such
expressions as “I would the Pope's gay lot were
mine,” with allusions highly complimentary to “The
monks of old,” are heard frequently, and at hours
which lead us to suppose that the choir are engaged
in nocturns or very early matins.
There is a distinctive species called “ the Fast
men,” no doubt from their abstemious self-denial. Many of these, at the
late examination, did not answer certain questions put them, and, when
they did respond, their replies were strange and very different from the
explanations of established commentators.
NOVEL DISCOVERY.
The antiquarians of St. Stephen's, Walbrook, were much puzzled the
other day, by the discovery of a very curious looking document, which an
old parish clerk recognised as “A Churchwarden's Account.” However,
there was something written on it which, for a long time, could not be
made out; at last, one old gentleman having somewhat better eyes than
the rest, discovered it to be the word “audited 1’’

With a blithe heart he leans o'er the gunnel,
And he carelessly puffs (to each lady's delight),
All his smoke and his cares 'baft the funnel.

RoM Exclusive sources, we announce, with un-
feigned delight, that a celebrated public servant
has received at the hands of a great prince an
honour which the press and the nation will alike
applaud. We, for our parts, are none of those
who grudge to a deserving contemporary the
reward of his labour and his genius. We cordially
felicitate him on his advancement, and trust
that the example so given will be one by which
other foreign Potentates will profit.
In one word, JENKINs has been promoted to the peerage and duke-
dom of France by the French King, Henry V. The Grand Cordon
of the Order of the Bell has, we understand, been sent to him, with
the cane and rich plush mantle of the knights of the order. The
investiture will speedily take place, and we trust to be present at
that august and affecting ceremony.
We are also authorised to state that, taking into consideration the
late eminent services of JAMEs GRUNT, Esq., whose work on Paris and
its populace has dealt the most severe blow to Louis-Philippe which
has ever been inflicted on that usurper, His Most Christian Majesty
has made Mr. Grunt Chevalier of his Order of the Pig and Whistle.
This is as it should be. We hail with delight the promotion of
Duke Jenkins and Sir James Grunt. Such honours honour the
exalted giver.

A CHRISTMAS GAME.
DEAR, DELIGHT FUL, Goon, VIRTuous PUNCH,
I am not going to be funny, but useful.
You may not be aware, Oh hero of the conical cap, that every
winter there are “published” various toys for the amusement of
youth, little coloured cards for playing juvenile round games. These
games are generally nothing more than modifications of the old
round game of “speculation,” shorn of every possibility of fun. One
card pays one counter to the pool, another takes one out, and in the
whole pack there is one finally good card (answering to the ace in
“speculation,”) by which the entire pool is gained.
The other day I purchased one which professed not only to beguile
a long evening, but to give useful moral instruction to little boys
and girls, by means of short maxims printed on the cards. One had
on it “Zeal is a sure path to wisdom,”—an aphorism which seems to
me of most delicious truth, inasmuch as I was once at a Syncretic
meeting, where there was zeal enough to set the room on fire, but no
wisdom at all. Another says, “Irritability is like a ruin which
breaks itself upon what it falls.” I assure you, Sir, I know Tully
the moralist, as well as Tully the composer; I have even dabbled
in Aristotle's ethics—but if I understand the meaning of the last
aphorism may I send all my numerous offspring to be birched by
Mother Brownrigg.
Now, Sir, I purpose to turn the principle of this sort of thing to a
better account ; and instead of diffusing a parcel of nonsensical
maxims, to have a pack of cards, which shall not only instruct the
rising generation in the various phrases in common use throughout
this city, but shall also inculcate the useful moral that sharpness is
everything in modern life. My game, Mr. Punch, I call the
ARTFUL DODGE
And the following are the regulations:—
1. The cards are to be thirty in number, and seven of them are to
have engravings as below.
2. The dealer puts 12 counters in the pool, and then deals three
cards all round. He that has the card
“Jolly old cock,”
shall pay one all round to the other players, to shew his liberality,
He that has
“deep oud File,”
shall receive one all round to shew the value of “depth” in this
life. If

not likely that “double sight” will be turned up on every occasion.

attached, but which merely answer to the non-trumps in “specula-
tion,” may be inscribed with little amusing and striking phrases,
such as, “Cut away Mike”—“Go it, my tulip"—“Rum ti tum with
the chill off.”—“Nix my dolly, pals fake away,”—and the like. By
playing a few rounds of this entertaining game, the minds of children
will be stored with a variety of expressions that are in daily use,

THE CLOCK OF ST. CLEMENT'S.
HAMLET, Prince of Denmark, has said, “What an extraordinary piece
of work is man " but the Mr. Hamlet, late of Prince's-street, the
jeweller and watchmaker, would certainly exclaim, “What an extraordi-
nary piece of work is the clock of St. Clement’s.” The hands met for
several hours the other day, but they recorded no minutes, and we can-
not say what passed. There is some talk of putting on additional hands,
in order to work the clock, but we beg leave to give notice that, until it
works of its own accord, we shall go on working it.
We have heard it whispered that a popular author is preparing a new
work of fiction to be called “St. Clement and his Times.” The subject—
considering that all the four times of the four faces are different—will
admit of infinite variety.
3Foreign Intelligence.
(FRom our own connespondent positively.)
Athens.
Y dear Mr. Punch,--I wrote to you on
our arrival in this remarkable city, and
I can assure you a most remarkable city
it is, looking exactly as if it had been
icked up and put down again at random
in a ploughed field, with one house here
and another there, and all the mac-
adamization scattered about every-
where, except on the roads.
I promised you to write about Greek
politics, morals, religion, and all that
sort of thing, and I am happy to say
that the peculiar advantages I have had
of obtaining information, will enable me
to do so satisfactorily. Of course it is a great thing to have arrived just
after all was over, as I shall be able to give you a correct account of the
revolution. I have asked my husband how I shall begin about politics, and
his answer is, “Say that parties are numerous, but that it is expected the
assembly will decide the strength of some of the leaders.” Now, I must
say that this appears to me more a question of beau monde than of politics;
as it can make very little difference whether balls and routs are numerous
or not, or which chief displays most strength dancing at this assembly, for
which the King has very condescendingly lent his ball-room. .
I shall begin by telling you, you must place no confidence in what you
see in the newspapers, as I have had occasion myself to perceive. For
instance, they have all of them declared that, after the change of govern-
ment, a new ministry was formed of two Russians, two French, two
English, and one Greek; whereas I can assure you they are all of them
Greek, and the foreigners have been sent away, except the Philhellenes,
who fought at the siege of Troy, of which General Church is one; and,
though he is an anti-Russian, I am told he speaks very good English.
The valet-de-place, we have taken (whose name is Vrey Panagoti) is
really a very interesting and superior young man. He is dressed like a
Greek warrior: I do not mean those indecent figures at the British
Museum, of which there are some here also, but like a real warrior, with
a white petticoat, mustachios, pistols, and red cap.
Wrey Panagoti says that, on the night of the 3rd of September, he
went to bed, by which he means that he laid down on his dirty capote
(as Byron says), and little thought of revolutions. By and bye, in the
middle of the night, he was awoke by a sound like the mighty rushing of
the sea, and the reports of a thousand muskets. He jumped up, and
running into the passage, found that a French Count had tumbled down
stairs in the dark over a pail of water. The French Count, it appears,
had learnt that a crowd was assembling under the palace, and was making
for the balcony, when this accident befell him. Wrey Panagoti, when he
discovered what was going on, was not foolish enough to expose himself
at any of the windows; but going down into the cellar, concealed himself
till the morning, when, finding that all the townspeople were out, and
that there was no prospect of fighting, he armed himself with his Alba-
nian gun, sword, long knife, short knife, and two pair of pistols, and thus
equipped, sallied forth to save his country. He assures me that he and
many others are very much dissatisfied with the new government for not
rewarding them for their services, and that he expects to be made a cap-
tain at least.
Captain Lyons represents the Queen of England, and there are several
extraordinary ministers at Athens. The Russian extraordinary minister,
the Austrian extraordinary minister, and the French extraordinary
minister; and these, with some chargés d'affaires, as the people call them,
because they have nothing to do, form the corps of diplomatists, who
afterwards enter the corps of gentlemen pensioners. Their business is
to look after the interest of Greece; and they seem to manage it very
well, as it is now at 24 per cent. per annum.
I will not do like some ladies, write on abstract questions of general
policy, and merely assuring you, en passant, that I have reason to know
that the Greeks will very shortly drive the Turks out of Europe into
America, and seat themselves on the dome of St. Sophia, I will conclude
this hasty letter with an account of our ascent of Mount Pentelicus,
from whence all your marble chimney-pieces come. Unfortunately, our
guide took us by a short cut; so that, instead of being two hours sº
up, as we should have been by the regular road, we lost our way, an
were seven hours wandering over the mountains, on sharp stones, that
are only exceeded by the sharp prickles. Oh my poor feet ! I shall
never recover it. But this is not the worst of it; for just as we got to
where we might have seen something, up there came a cloud in a minute
as it were, and down there came a pelting rain that drenched us to the
skin in no time. We therefore hurried down, miserable enough, and
more dead than alive ; but when we reached the carriage at the bottom
of the hill, we had the satisfaction of knowing that, if we were then at the
top, we should have enjoyed a most splendid view, as the clouds had all
blown away again, as quickly as they had come. Yours ever,
JANE Jones.

ANOTHER WORD ON THE SHIRT QUESTION.
“SHIRT-wean ERs, to the Rescue !”
DEAR PUNCH,
While you are engaging the public attention upon
the price paid to sempstresses for the making of shirts, could you not
effect a reform, that would not merely advantage a small class of
people, viz. the makers, but benefit a vast, I may say considerable
majority, of our population, namely, the wearers of shirts *
a shirt of Mail.
I allude, my dear fellow, to the washing of the same article. My
laundress brought me home mine three weeks since, and I was
charged for it five PENCE. Of this I give you my sacred honour: in
fact, I forward you the bill receipted. Is it just, is it consonant
with good feeling, or sound commercial policy, that that should cost
fivepence in the washing, which, IN THE Act UAL MAKING, costs but
a fifth part of the sum
What has been the consequence? The speculatrix has been dis-
appointed in her infernal scheme upon my purse ; and I, who might
have changed my linen twice, aye, or Foua TIMEs per month, have
been now twenty-three days wearing the garment in question.
Calling upon every Briton to do likewise,
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your constant reader,
Clarence Club, January, 1844. PHILoplcky.
REGARDING THE ROYAL GEORGE BILLIARD
TABLE.
The humble Petition of Mr. Punch.
MAY IT PLEAs E You R Most GRAcious MAJEsty :
Although of a humble stock, and although my wife, Madam
Judy, has not been presented at your Majesty's court, yet we humbly
declare that the whole court doth not contain two more loyal and
duteous subjects.
May it please your Majesty, we are very old; we have been in the
custom of mixing for centuries past with every class of the people
of this kingdom, and we are enemies to no manner of sport where-
with they amuse themselves.
Billiards, among others, is a good sport. It has the privilege of
uniting many honourable gentlemen daily together of the army, of
the universities, and of the swell mob, at the watering-places. It
has the eminent merit of leading to the detection of many rogues
and swindlers; it keeps many ingenious markers, brandy-merchants,
and soda-water venders in honourable maintenance, and is a great
aid and patron of the tobacco trade, thereby vastly increasing the
revenues of your Majesty's Government.
With that sport then we are far from quarrelling. But there is
for this and for all other games a time and place. Thus in the late
Mr. Hogarth's facetious print (I knew the gentleman very well) the
Beadle is represented as caning “the Idle Apprentice” for playing
at marbles—no, not for playing at marbles, but playing on a grave-
stone during Sunday service. In like manner, were I to set up my
show before St. James's Church during service hours, or under your
Majesty's triumphal arch at Pimlico, or in the Bishop of London's
drawing-room—it is likely, not that the Beadle would cane me, for
that I would resist, but that persons in blue habiliments, oil-skin
hatted, white-lettered, and pewter-buttoned—policemen in a word,
would carry me before one of your Majesty's Justices of the Peace.
My crime would be, not the performance of my tragedy of “Punch”
—but its performance in an improper manner and time.
Ah, Madam I Take this apologue into your royal consideration,
and recollect that as is Punch and Marbles so are Billian Ds.
They too may be played at a wrong place. If it is wrong to play
at marbles on a tombstone, is it just to play at billiards on a coffin–
an indifferent coffin—anybody's coffin Is such a sport quite just,
feeling, decorous, and honourable 1
Perhaps your Majesty is not aware, what the wreck of the Royal
George really is. Sixty years ago its fate made no small sensation.
Eight hundred gallant men, your Royal Grandfather's subjects, went
down to death in that great ship. The whole realm of England was
stirred and terrified by their awful fate—the clergy spoke of it from
their pulpits—the greatest poet then alive wrote one of the noblest
ballads in our language, which as long as the language will endure,
shall perpetuate the melancholy story. Would your Majesty wish
Mr. Thomas Campbell to continue the work of Mr. William Cowper,
and tell what has now become of the wreck Lo it is a billiard-
table, over which his Royal Highness the Prince de Joinville may be
knocking about red balls and yellow—or his Serenity, the Prince of
Hohenzollen Sigmaringen may be caramboling with his coat off.
Ah, Madame! may your royal fingers never touch a cue; it is a losing
hazard that you will play at that board.
The papers say there is somewhere engraved in copper on the
table, a “suitable inscription.” What, is it? I fancy it might run
thus :—
“THIs BILLIARD TABLE Is FortMed of PART of THE TIMBERS
of The Royal GEORGE MAN-of-war, of 100 guns,
which went Down on THE 29TH AUGUST 1782.
EIGHT HUNDRED seameN PERISHED ON BOARD,
IN THE SERVICE of THEIR country AND their king.
Honour be to the BRAVE Who die in such A service.
As A FITTING MARK of HER SENSE of THESE BRAve MEN's Misfortunes,
As A TESTIMONY of syMPATHY FoR THEIR FATE,
as An Encourt Agement to Englishmen
to BRAVE THEIR LIVES IN similar PERILs,
In HoPES THAT FUTURE sovereigns
MAY AWARD THEM SIMILAR DELICATE SYMPATHY:
ABOVE ALL, As A STERN MONUMENT
of the vanity of NAvAL Glory,
The UselessNEss of AMBITION,
AND THE Folly of FIDELITY,

ºffer £iajesty, Khueen &icturia,
HAS GRAciously CAUSED THIS PLAY-TABLE TO BE MADE
FROM THE Tim Berts of
THE FAIthful, useless, worn-out old vessel.”
Should your Majesty still wish to amuse yourself at your royal
table, your petitioners would suggest, that there are numberless foolish
relics throughout the country that might by an economic and inge-
nious person be made available for purposes of sport.
Thus—the mainmast of the Victory immediately offers itself,
standing as it does quite convenient at Windsor, and supporting the
bust of a person by the name of Nelson. This great, rough, ugly
mast might be made into neat cues to play at the Royal George
billiard-table, and the bust might be turned into marbles for his
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. Whether for matches, humming-
tops, draught or chess-men, Marlborough's baton would be excel-
lently suitable. The Black Prince's helmet would furnish some
admirable tenpenny nails, and the whole nursery might be provided
with masqueradery materials by cutting up a very few Waterloo flags.
If these changes tend to your Majesty's pleasure, why not effect
them 1 The country will look on with approbation ; the news-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S PANTOMIME
The following Pantomime (like our production of last year) is much too
good to be acted, and the public will be kind enough, therefore, to feel
satisfied with reading it. It is called—
%arleſtin Çpºrtiºnariſtm;
OR, THE WIZARD OF WALBROOK.
SCENE I.—St. Stephen's Church by daylight; showing the NA vs and
the Select Vestry. One of the CHURChwARDENs discovered.
Churchwarden.
For twice ten weeks—and ten to that again,
They've ask'd for my accounts—and ask'd in vain.
For oh how dare the varlets to expect
A sight intended but for eyes select :
[Slow Music—he lies down and goes to sleep.
A flash of red fire. Enter a GENIUs.
CHURChwardEN (starting up).
Ha! who art thou, disturbing thus my slumbers ?
GENIUs.
I am the Genius of mystic numbers.
I wish to serve you ! With a dreadful shock
You've lately run your head against a Rock.
CHURCH wardEN.
You're right—I have but I don't care a bit;
For by that Rock I’ll ne'er be made to split.
But can you aid me !
GENIUs.
Aye, and will ! I’ve power
To make up your accounts in half an hour.
Churchwarden.
Thanks, noble Genius, my joy’s complete.
GENIUs. *
Sprite of the Balance-sheet !
[Music—He waves his wand, and a SPRITE appears holding
a magic balance-sheet bringing in the parish several
hundred pounds in debt to the Churchwarden. Blue
and red fire ; during which the CHURChwARDEN sinks
through a trap with the magic balance-sheet, attended by
the SPRITE and the GENIUs.
What ho! appear !
SCENE II.-A rocky pass, with an impenetrable Rock in the foreground.
Music. Enter the CHURChwarden cautiously.
ChurchwardEN.
I've got so far. I’m puzzled now, alas !
To find the means this flinty Rock to pass:
The cloak I wear is useless, much I fear,
If that great Rock coines down upon me here.
A voice from the Rock.
Again I ask, though vain the question be,
Will you allow us your accounts to see :
ChunchwardEN.
Ah taunt me not, my blood-parochial mounts
With rage, when ask'd to furnish my accounts;
Within my breast the lion seems to rise.
Show my accounts to rude and vulgar eyes 1
To those who'd every petty item scan
I never will ; indeed, I never can.
A rumbling noise is heard in the Rock, which falls suddenly on the
CHURCHWARDEN, and overwhelms him.
SCENE III.-The Cave of Despair. Enter some Parishioners and the
Rector, who grope about to soft music after the ChurchwARDEN.
Enter the CHURChwarden. The lights are quite down, and he en-
deavours to drop the mystic accounts into the Well of Oblivion, which
is seen in the back ground. Just as he is about to do so, a Fairy rises,
and the mystic accounts fly into the air amid a cloud of smoke and
blue fire.
FAIRY.
This hubbub cease 1 attend awhile to me,
Since your accounts the world will never see.
And, as a slippery person you are twitted,
For slippery pantaloon you well are fitted.
The Rock which heavily on you came down
Shall be at hand to worry you as Clown.
The Rector, who has tried to calm the din,
Shall have the magic hat of Harlequin;
And, as to see the sport I much incline,
Myself will take the part of Columbine.
BUSINEss.
The Churchwarden, as PANTAloon, comes down to the front, puts his
tongue in his left cheek, pulls an account-book out of his pocket,
winks at the audience, and says, “Here we are l’’ Clown tries to
get hold of the book, but PANTAloon says, “No you don't l” HARLE-
QUIN shakes his wand. Clown trips PANTAloon up, who falls on his
back, but shakes his head, and says “How are you?” to HARLEQUIN,
who turns upon his heel; and the scene closes.
SCENE II.-The Sea-bathing Infirmary, Margate. PANTAloon comes
in and cuts a few capers ; Clown follows. He offers to teach the
former Arithmetic. PANTAloon takes the slate and makes a number
of unmeaning figures. Clown looks at them and can't understand
them. PANTAloon gives a book, which he calls a Key to his Arith-
metic, and Clown reads “Walker,” on the title-page. PANTAloon
shuffles off, with Clown hallooing after him.
The whole of the business is in the same style as that which we have
described above; and the reader can therefore easily imagine it. The
tricks and transformations are of the most wonderful kind; and one, con-
sisting of the change from a bundle of sticks into a select vestry, is parti-
cularly striking. Amongst the tricks is an extraordinary contrivance, by
which an immense pair of scales, with a balance labelled “BALANce on
AN IMMENSE Scale,” appear to pass naturally into PANTAloon's pocket.
A JUST COMPLAINT.
3rd Kerb-stone, Regent-street.
HonourED SIR,--I superintend a crossing in Regent-street, and to it
I have devoted the energies of, I trust, a not mis-spent life: and now in
my old age, to be cast aside as rubbish—the idea is agonizing !
I was making a hearty dinner off a benevolent gentleman (a dandy had
afforded but a poor breakfast) and alternately luxuriating in a twopenny-
plate of beef-à-la-mode, and the columns of the Morning Post, when
my corn gave a foreboding twinge, and my eye fell on the following
announcement:—“The sweeping-machine which was lately so success-
fully tested in Regent-street is to be introduced into all our principal
thoroughfares.” O, Mr. Punch, intercept your powerful hand, and pre-
serve an unoffending, deserving race from extinction ; deserving—for
what can be more consistent with the principle of charity, than to make
the way clear for our fellows 1 Unoffending—for who will deny our
civility (when well paid)? Perhaps we may give the uneharitable coxcomb
a sly splash; but do not the best of men throw dirt at each other, and
that without any provocation ?
These machines, Sir, take my word for it—have been taken in hand
by some great person, and of course will be patronised by every one
else; for society is like a cab-stand,-if the first horse in the rank moves,
all the rest follow its example.
I feel, Sir, already, that I have as little business here as the Statue of
Shakspeare has over the portal of Drury Lane ; but I cannot tear myself
away, for I am on my five-and-twentieth broom, and a quarter through
my fourth wooden-leg ; and there are ties—nay knots—of affection that
bind me to my (lamp) post.
Yours in sorrow,
A Desponding Sweeper.
Mud for the Million,
In consequence of the muddy state of the streets, orders have been given
that every householder in the City shall sweep the footpath before his own
house. It is fortunate for Lord Brougham he does not reside in the City,
for he would have tolerably hard work to clear away all the rubbish that
is laid at his door.
We understand that the noble lord intends giving to the citizens the
benefit of his experience, by publishing a new hand-book, to be called—
“Every Man his own Scavenger.”
I.ifts to Lazy Lawyers.
Q. Give an instance of a “Similiter”
A. You're another
Q. What is the meaning of “putting yourself upon the country P"
A. Going to the workhouse.
Q. Where is the Great Seal kept
A. In the Arctic Ocean. A small specimen may be seen at the Zoolo-
gical Gardens.
Q. What are “Breaches of Trust”
4. Trowsers procured on Tick.

THE
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.
Punch is informed by his American Correspondent, that the
President's Message to Congress, which has lately appeared in the
papers, was a fabrication from beginning to end, and that the following
is a correct version of it:-
“FEllow Citizens AND GENTLEMEN,
“You will allow me, I estimate, to congratulate you on the considerably
dignified station, and particularly high moral position, in which our
glorious Republic now stands among the nations of the earth.
“America is everywhere trusted, feared, honoured, and beloved, which
most it is difficult to say. I opinionate, however, that she is as much
beloved as honoured, as much honoured as feared, as much feared as
trusted.
“Such is the blessing which, from a liberal and unselfish international
policy, from an undeviating course of public rectitude, and a remarkable
prevalence of private integrity, has devolved upon the head of a magna-
nimous people. When I speak of the people's head, do not misunderstand
me. I am, I reckon, a genuine Republican, and have no idea that the
people, except in a figurative sense, has any head at all.
“Let us, my fellow. citizens, persevere in that path of wisdom and
virtue which we have hitherto so creditably pursued. Let us go on; and
we shall assuredly go a-head.
“And now, let me briefly remark on one or two points, on which, I
calculate, you are desirous of ascertaining my notions.
“The dispute between ourselves and the Britishers, concerning the
Oregon territory, yet remains unsettled. In the name of Peace and
Concord, let it be brought to a speedy termination. If we find ourselves
strong enough to cope with the Britishers. let us fight them; if not, let
us leave them alone ; and content ourselves with protesting against their
insatiable rapacity.
“The annexation of Texas is a measure which we have long had in con-
templation. The natives of that country will object, I guess, to the pro-
ceeding; but they do not see their own interest, which is ours. Ours,
then, be the good work of enlightening, while we astonish, their weak
minds. Let us take the rifle of philanthropy and the sword of justice,
and enter, as soon as possible, on this labour of love. To effectuate it,
we shall only want a little powder and shot; let us wait no longer than
till we can raise the money to buy them.
“The prosperity of our free and enlightened republic is essential to the
welfare of mankind, to which, unfortunately, that of England is hostile.
It becomes, therefore, our bounden though painful duty to aggrandise
ourselves as much as we can at her expense. Greatly as we may admire
reciprocity in the abstract, we must negative that principle in our trans-
actions with her. The cause of enlightenment, of civilisation, the com-
mon weal of humanity, require that we should take as much from her,
and give her as little as possible. We may regret being placed under
this stern necessity, but we must not shrink from our duty. Let us,
therefore, nobly persist in the imposition of prohibitive duties on British
imports ; nay, let us fearlessly increase them, and confidently hope to
realize, in the end, the reward of our disinterestedness.
“Let me now advert to a kindred, and most important topic. Need I
say that I mean Repudiation ? I am sorry, my fellow citizens, to be
obliged to give you, with respect to this point, what, I fear, will be unpala-
table advice. I know how anxious you all are to hurl back with interest,
the paltry dross which is demanded of you. But America must be just
before she is generous. The eyes of Europe are upon her; she must
preserve her honour inviolate. She dares not defraud herself. You con-
tracted your so-called debts, my countrymen, to indemnify yourselves for
the losses which you had sustained through commercial artifices. Sly,
cunning England over-reached simple, confiding, artless America. You
might have opposed craft by craft, subtlety by subtlety. You did no such
thing. You asked for that which was your own; and you got it. Shall
you refund it—shall you cheat yourselves, and abet the dishonesty of
others? Oh no In a word, shall you pay your creditors? That is a
plain question. My answer is as plain—certainly not.
“I felicitate you on the cheap and efficient manner by which foreign
literature (especially Punch) is diffused through the United States.
“I am happy that the wise Institution of Slavery still exists among you.
It is the servitude of the Negro which secures the freedom of the Citizen.
Listen not to the sophistry of the Abolitionist, who would endeavour to
persuade you that black is white. I entirely approbate the conduct of the
slaveholders, as a body, towards the creatures committed to their charge.
“I trust that the great principles of Lynch Law will never be lost
sight of among you. . The execution of an offender without judge or jury
is an expeditious mode of administering justice. It is also a cheap one;
and I need not, I speculate, suggest to you the importance, just now, of
national economy.
“Let me, in connection with the last remark, remind you that there is
a slight deficiency in the revenue. To meet this, I dubitate not that you
will soon devise some honourable and profitable speculation. Should no
plan of that kind occur to you. you can have recourse, for assistance, to
sone foreign power. We cannot, perhaps, under existing circumstances,
expect much from Europe ; but, I calculate, we might negotiate a consi-
derable loan with the Emperor of China. Should he refuse to help us,
although our uppermost desire is for the maintenance of universal peace,
it would be incumbent on us to teach him, by the requisite arguments, the
obligations which, as a cosmopolite, he is under to his fellow-creatures.
“I am, Fellow Citizens and Gentlemen,
“Your faithful Help,
“ John TYLER.”
3Legal.—CHRISTMAS GAIETIES.
he gaieties of the season
were well kept up at
the Westminster Sessions,
which came off on what is
technically termed Boxing-
day. The centre cushion,
with a book under it to
make it higher, and called
by courtesy the chair—was
taken at ten o'clock pre-
cisely. The attendance of
magistrates was so thin,
that it looked as if a row
of them had been sown, and
only one or two had come
up—the crop—to pursue
the agricultural simile—having proved a failure.
The learned chairman proceeded to entertain the grand jury with a few
remarks, including a dissertation on the word “grand,” and a glance at
what the grandeur of a jury consisted in. He likewise informed them that
they were a very ancient body, being nearly as old as the sheriff, and twice
as old as the coroner; so that, by referring to the Moon's age in Punch's
Almanack, and ascertaining the year in which Mr. Wakley was born, the
gentlemen of the grand jury may discover their mean antiquity.
After despatching a few prisoners to Parkhurst, and sentencing some
half-dozen to the Cold Bath system in the celebrated Fields, the learned
chairman congratulated the jury on their duties having been brief; for-
getting, probably, that the state of things which made the duties of the
jury brief, rendered the position of the bar briefless.
THE SONG OF THE TURNCOCK.
AIR.—“Young Love lived once.”
Young Jones lived once in a humble shed,
Where, cabbage vending,
And coals intending
To sell when his connection spread,
A somewhat decent life he led :
His business flourished,
A hope we nourished
He’d pay the rate he ow'd of ours;
And so his cistern still we fed,
For not e'en Jones could trust to showers.
Oh I that the Tax Collector’s eye
Should eer go thither,
Our hopes to wither:
He chanced for taxes to apply,
And thought that Jones was going to fly.
I came one morning,
Ere Jones had warning,
And cut the pipe where the water lay.
“Oh, oh,” said Jones, “is it thus?–Good bye | "
So he pack'd his goods up and cut away.
Important and Telegraphic.
News have just reached us, from a quarter upon which we can place
the highest reliance, that Mr. Hamley, of the Noah's Ark, in Holborn,
has received an order to despatch immediately several companies of
cavalry and infantry to Ireland.
The soldiers, together with their arms, ammunition, and a vast collec-
tion of plates, dishes, and tea-things, are consigned to the care of a Dublin
merchant; and the same crate that conveys them also carries a large
quantity of guns and balls.
Each of the regiments is accompanied by an ingenious contrivance for
deploying the whole company simultaneously, or causing them to fall into
their ranks with equal ease.
And it is also whispered that the Light Horse Regiment which has been
so long engaged in going over the glass bridge, at the top of Cheapside,
under the command of General Dunnett, will likewise depart upon the
same service.

BOLD SPECULATION |
== ARious rumours are afloat respecting the
- robable arrangement of Trafalgar-square.
#. subjoined hand-bill, which came into
the possession of Punch in a very curious
manner, may possibly throw some light on
the subject. Of the authenticity of the
document some doubts may be entertained ;
and yet, altogether, considering the known
anxiety of Ministers to render taxation as
little onerous as possible, and how likely
they are to consult, in any financial measure,
the public convenience, and to resort, in
preference to others, to such sources of
revenue as would be least felt, Punch is inclined to credit the announce-
ment. It is as follows:—

SIR ROBERT PEEL
Has the honour to announce that he has taken, on behalf of Her Majesty's
Government, a lease of those spacious and commodious premises known
to the Public as

has come to the determination of converting this extensive area into a
place of Public Amusement—namely, an Amphitheatre, to be entitled

In which Entertainments will be provided for the People on a scale of
unparalleled magnificence. The object of the PREMIER and his Colleagues
is two-fold; primarily, to provide the million with a cheap means of
recreation ; secondarily, by the derivation of VolunTARY CoNTRIBUTIONs
to the Treasury, to increase the Revenue. Should he be honoured by
the public patronage, he confidently anticipates to be enabled, in a short
space of time, to effect the
ABOLITION OF THE INCOME-TAX I
by means of the proceeds of the nightly overflows which he expects to be
attracted by the performances. That burden having been removed, the
receipts will thenceforth be devoted to the
Izeduction of the National Debt I
after the deduction of moderate profits for the man ent and
performers. The Circus will be constructed on the ancient Roman
model ; and SIR Robert PEEL need not remind the Classical Public that
TRAFALGAR SQUARE is, in fact, a free translation of CAMPUs MARTius.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.—OF THE KING's (OR QUEEN’s) REVENUE.
HE Royal revenue is either ordinary or extra-
ordinary; but what is ordinary for a sove-
reign, would be quite extraordinary for any
other individual. It has subsisted time out
of mind ; and indeed the times must have
been out of their mind, or mad, when they
fixed the revenue at the enormous rate it was
formerly fixed at.
The first item in the ordinary revenue
consists of the temporalities of all bishoprics
whenever a see becomes vacant ; but these
are now merely nominal : for there are
always so many arms ready to thrust them-
selves into a pair of lawn sleeves the moment
they are empty, that the Sovereign has no
chance of making anything by a see con-
tinuing unoccupied. William Rufus had a knack of keeping the sees
empty a long time, and not only pocketing the temporalities to a pretty
tune, but refusing to give them up to the new bishop without a considerable
sum, which he generally managed to get ; for few prelates were long con-
tented with enjoying only the capacious sleeves, and the pasteboard mitre.
Secondly, The King is entitled to what the law, calls a corody, namely,
to send one of his chaplains to be maintained by the bishop, until the
bishop promotes him to a benefice. This plan of quartering hungry
curates upon well-fed prelates has now fallen into disuse. It certainly
partook more of the military than the civil law, and was founded on the
old practice of billeting soldiers upon publicans.
Thirdly, the King is entitled to the tithes of places that are extra-
parochial; but, since tithes have been commuted, this branch of the royal
revenue might be deposited in the foyal eye, without any detriment to the
royal eyesight.
The fourth branch comprises the First Fruits, which are not, as some
have supposed, the earliest crop of gooseberries in the parish, but the first
year's profits of the living ; so that the parson would be compelled to live
upon his wits during the first twelve months, or run into debt for that
period to all the tradespeople. These First Fruits, amounting annually to
a great deal more than a plum, were originally gathered for the use of the
Pope; but Henry the Eighth, having thrown off the papal power, thought
proper to bag the papal perquisites, and took possession of the First Fruits
as a part of the royal revenue.
Queen Anne, however, to whom First Fruits, like unripe gooseberries,
occasioned many a qualm, determined to give them up to augment the
poorer livings, and the First Fruits have been preserved under the name
of Queen Anne's Bounty.
The fifth branch consists of the rents and profits of the Crown Lands,
including Regent-street and other sylvan retreats, which come under
the jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests. What there
is woody about Regent-street, except the pavement, it is difficult to say ;
and the connexion with a forest is still more dubious, except that it was a
branch of the royal revenue.
Formerly the sovereign had the right of pre-emption, or buying up pro-
visions, to the preference of others,without the consent of the owner; that is
to say, he might have stopped the strawberry-women, as they walked into
town, and bought every pottle of hautboys on his own terms; or he might
have insisted on intercepting those waggon-loads of cabbages, which pour
into Covent-Garden Market, and have had them all put in at the very
lowest figure for the use of the royal household. This privilege of pre-
emption was, however, resigned at the Restoration, by Charles the Second,
who agreed to take it out in beer, or, in other words, receive a duty of
fifteen pence a barrel on all the heavy wet sold in the kingdom.
The seventh branch consisted of a charge for licences to sell wine; but
as this was liable to evasion, by sloe juice being sold instead, the revenue
was abolished, and a compromise of 7000l. a year was taken by the Crown
instead of it.
The eighth branch consists of fines for violation of the forest laws,
which have for many years past amounted exactly to the same sum, which
may be quoted in round numbers at 0l. 0s. 0d.
he ninth branch consists of the profits arising from proceedings in
Courts of Justice ; but as there is more plague than profit in all legal pro-
ceedings, the royal revenue may here be quoted at about the same as
Pennsylvanian bonds, or shares in the bridge of Waterloo.
The tenth branch comprises whale and sturgeon, which belong of right
to the king, when thrown ashore or caught near the coast ; but the cunning
fish seldom give royalty a chance of netting anything in this manner.
The king is, eleventhly, entitled to all legal wrecks; and “this,” says
Sir Peter Laurie, “is perhaps the reason why the King is called Rex, or
Wrecks, in all legal documents.” When the Thunder was wrecked by
the reckless conduct of the crew of the Lightning, it does not appear that
the sovereign claimed the former,
As she lay,
All the day,
In the Bay of Lambeth-hol
Twelfthly, the sovereign is entitled to all the gold mines in his dominions.
As the Prince of Wales is a minor, perhaps he will be able to direct his
royal parents to the mines alluded to.
Thirteenthly, the king is entitled to treasure-trove that is to say, he
may appropriate all the silver spoons, purses, bank-notes, watches,
pocket handkerchiefs, and other valuables left lying in the streets without
any one to pick them up or own them. If a man throws his property into
the sea or on to the earth, he is supposed to have abandoned it, and the
sovereign may claim it; so that if a gentleman, coming from a dinner-
party, throws a handful of halfpence amongst a crowd, it seems that the
sovereign might beat off the mob and pick up the copper.
Fourteenthly may be classed waifs, or property thrown down by a
thief in the act of flight ; so that if a pickpocket takes a handkerchief, and
the king should happen to witness the act, he may cut after the thief in
the hope of picking up a waif, by the article being thrown down, or dropped
by the delinquent.
Fifteenthly are estrays, or animals found wandering about without an
owner; and, considering how many donkies are in this erratic state, it is a
wonder that this branch of the royal revenue is not more productive. It
would, however, be converting the Court of Buckingham Palace into a
Green-Yard, if this source of income were to be looked after by the
sovereign ; and hence it is that cabmen can leave their horses on the
rank, without fear of the animals being treated as estrays, and walked off
to the palace for the benefit of royalty.
The Sixteenth branch consists of confiscated goods, including deodands,
or things forfeited on account of their having caused death by accident.
If a wheel runs over a man and kills him, the wheel belongs to the king;
and if an ox tosses up an individual so high that he never comes down
again (alive.) the king may enjoy the horns as a part of his revenue.
The Seventeenth branch arises from escheats, or lands for which there
are no heirs; but these lands are so scarce that there are no grounds
for the supposition that the royal revenue derives any advantage from
them.
The Eighteenth branch of the king's revenue consists in the custody of
idiots, or the right of appropriating the lands of a purus idiota, or right
down fool—a class so numerous, that it was thought the property of the
barons would gradually get into the hands of the sovereign ; and, there-
fore, on petition, the estate of a non compos may be committed to the care
of some one, for the benefit of the heir, for “the lords were naturally
fearful,” says Fleta, or Fleeter, who is not quite so slow a coach as some
of the jurists—“the lords were naturally fearful that the Crown should
make idiots of them all, and bone their property.”
It seems then, that out of eighteen sources of income, there is really
nothing worth speaking of, to be got ; and consequently, it is usual for the
House of Commons to Vote a Supply first, and then think about the
Ways and Means of raising it.
We now come to the extraordinary branches of the revenue, and shall
begin with the land tax, which is a substitute for hydages, scutages,
talliages, and other outlandish pretexts for getting hold of money.
In ancient times every knight was bound to attend the king in battle
for forty days in a year; but as it would be very inconvenient for a man
like Sir Peter Laurie to give his personal assistance in the wars, the
matter came to be compromised for a sum of money called a scutage—and
afterwards a hydage, probably in allusion to the hyding—or hiding—from
which the compromise preserved the parties paying it.
Afterwards came the practice of subsidies, which consisted of money
taken from the Commons, under the guise of their having granted it.
These subsidies have now subsided into a land-tax.
Next comes the malt tax, which is thought to be a proper penalty on
the very uncourtly practice of biting the initials into pewter pots ; and
the customs form a part of the revenue, including butlerage, or the right
of taking two tons ..} wine from every ship—a process which, considering
the quantity of vessels that carry no wine at all, savours so much of get-
ting blood out of a stone, that we are not surprised at the practice being
abandoned.
The excise we need hardly allude to, for every one knows, by personal
experience, the nature of it—there being scarcely a single article of con-
sumption, that is not partly consumed by the excise duty.
The post office, the stamps, and the duty on hackney carriages, are
also branches of the revenue—so that the badge on the omnibus conduc-
tor's breast, is like so much money taken from his very heart—a remark
that will also apply to the cab-driver.
The Assessed-taxes come next, and embrace the duty on windows;
which constitutes a terrible look-out for those who have to pay it. These
taxes also comprise the impost on horses and dogs—which are said by
Buffon to be the natural companions of man ; but it is hard that man
should have to pay so dearly for their company.
The tax on hair-powder used to fall heavily on the briefless barristers,
but they have rushed recklessly into horsehair, and run their heads into
a species of composition wig, which combines the lightness of wire with the
durability of cat-gut. Armorial bearings are also liable to a duty; and it
is therefore not safe to seal a letter with anything but the top of a thimble,
lest, by adopting a more elegant contrivance, the tax-gatherer should
pounce down upon you for what he may call a crest ; though it is in fact
nothing but a chance device on a second-hand wafer stamp.
There is also a duty on I ensions, perhaps to make up for the absence of

w
duty on the part of those to whom the pensions are
payable. The first purpose to which the revenue is
devoted is the interest of the national debt, which
commenced in 1693, just five years after the glorious
revolution of 1688, and was probably one of the
glorious results of it. The national debt has increased
several millions, in spite of the efforts of certain com-
missioners for reducing it. These gentlemen now
and then announce the fact of their having rubbed
off a few pounds at one end, while, somehow or other,
a few thousands have been rubbed on at the other.
If, till the debt is paid off, the commission is to be
continued, it may be fairly pronounced immortal.
The only method of getting rid of it would be for the
sovereign to file a petition at the Insolvent Court in
the name of the nation, and solemnly take the benefit
of the act, in the presence of all the fundholders.
The whole of the revenues already described were
given up by George III. to the public, in lieu of an
allowance which was called the civil list—from the
extreme civility on the side both of the king and the
people. Some complaints have been occasionally made
of the large amount of this civil list; but when all
things are considered—the state-coach, the drawing-
rooms, the levees, the palace dinners, and last, but
not least, the royal progresses, we do not see how
her Majesty can “do it” for less money than is paid
to her.
It will have been seen, from our view of the
royal prerogative and revenue, that the sovereignty
is tolerably well hedged in with restrictions, and has,
after all, very few opportunities of rendering itself
obnoxious.
The army is at its beck and call, but the Commons =
must vote the money for supporting it ; and an army
without pay would be little better than a steam-
engine without steam, or the keeper of Burlington
Arcade without his brass-bound bludgeon. It is
true the sovereign has the run of the treasury, but
there is seldom any money in hand, for it is always
spent first and raised afterwards. It is not now as it
was in the days of the Johns and Richards, who,
directly they usurped the throne, used to jump into
a cab and rush to the Horse-Guards, “to secure,”
as Hume tells us, “the crown and treasure.” These
days of royal roguery are gone, and we may now
venerate the crown and respect the sovereign, with-
out feeling called upon to address to Englishmen
those emphatic words, “Take care of your pockets.”
S()NGS OF THE SEEDY.
WHEN blighted hearts and seedy coats
Are both together found,
The wretched union denotes
That all is dark around.
My heart, alas! is sear'd indeed,
And all exposed to view,
Because my wrapper, from the Tweed,
Is wearing almost through.
They tell me I should wear a cloak,
They say that sorrow must ;
But when they do, I'm sure they joke,
For nobody will trust
I've tempted Doudney with a bill,
But he has worn a frown,
And, pointing coolly to his till.
Has whisper’d—“Cash—sir—down.”
Alas ! 'tis ever thus with those
who live upon their wits;
They sometimes get a suit of clothes
By starts—but not by fits.
The seedy coat, and blighted heart,
The cold ones do not heed ;
But you and I shall never part,
My wrapper—oh my Tweed

Address to the Public.
The object of this Society is purely philanthropic, being to relieve the
frightful amount of matrimonial destitution now so extensively prevalent.
Perhaps the united classes are not aware that there are at this moment
many, very many, individuals of from one-and-twenty to thirty years and
upwards, now dragging on their existence in a state of cheerless celibacy;
the female portion of them without a protector, the male with nobody to
look after their things.
The Wife Assurance Society will place within the reach of almost every
Iman
A PARTN E R o F. H. Is Jo Ys,
and
A soother of His SORRows:
as well, as
A Decided Ornament to his Establishment.
Celibacy is either voluntary or involuntary. To those who remain
single from choice, the following considerations are respectfully submitted.
It is to be premised that they are addressed to the sterner sex, of whom
that class of persons is chiefly, if not entirely, composed.
Bachelorship is often denominated single blessedness. Blessedness may
be said to consist in the union of moral serenity with physical comfort.
The former is essentially dependent on the latter. Tranquillity of mind
is incompatible with a stomach-ache. Equally inconsistent with equani-
mity are a combination and succession of minor evils, such as those to
which the single man is exposed.
When, on putting on our clean Corazza of a cold morning, we discover
that the collar of it is minus a button, how fearfully excited we become !
How painful the interval during which, shivering and wretched, we
rummage everywhere for a pin for what bachelor's toilet is ever graced
by a pin-cushion ? A yet longer period must elapse ere the process of
pinning—troublesome, tiresome process to accomplish by one's self—can
be effected; and the chances are that our finger is pricked in the
attempt. Are rage, frenzy, and imprecations conformable with a state of
blessedness
Equally, how exasperating it is to find that we have only one clean pair
of stockings, with a great hole in the end of each ; that our every wash-
waistcoat is at the laundress's, or that our last pocket-handkerchief has
been used. The mind of man, engrossed in study and contemplation, is
unable to adapt itself to linen and hosiery, matters to which the feminine
intellect “agnizes” (in the beautiful language of ShakespeaRE) “a
natural and prompt alacrity” in attending. To look over sheets when
they come from the mangle—how uncongenial an employment for the
philosopher
The bachelor, for the most part, resides in lodgings. The dusty mantel-
piece, the patched carpet, the scanty window curtains, the tremulous
table, the ricketty chair, are all so many sources of discomfort and annoy-
ance. With what bitter disappointment does the single occupant of the
two-pair back discover that the tea-pot has been filled, for his morning's
breakfast, with luke-warm water by the maid-of-all-work And with
what yet more painful feelings does he observe the marks of her fingers
on the sugar-basin . How indignantly, too, does he remark that his tea-
caddy has been invaded !—his bottle of whiskey subtracted from :
Punch has generally heard it pleaded by young men, that their reason
for remaining single is their inability to maintain a wife. He could not
É. into their affairs, of course, but he has known them sit, hour after
our, in a tavern, smoking cigars, and drinking tumbler after tumbler,
followed by chops, stewed cheese, an anchovy toast, and scalloped oysters.
In a domesticated state, they would have had tea instead, which would
have been much more economical, and every one knows, indeed, it is
painful to see, how little ladies generally eat.
It is to be remembered that pipes and alcoholic liquors are superseded
by matrimony. The “go” is resorted to as a stimulant to the spirits
depressed by a life of loneliness; the tobacco as a sedative to the heart,
whose cravings, equally with those of the stomach, it allays. Addiction
to either is incompatible with domestic bliss. With this the Virginian weed
is especially at variance, and oh I how much money young men might
save in cigars 1
Involuntary celibacy arises from two causes. One of these is poverty;
the other, ineligibility. The latter misfortune, in very many instances, is
remediable. Why should locks of a dye a little too golden, why should a
slight obliquity of vision, why should a trifling exuberance of form, debar,
as is too often the case, an amiable young creature from happiness!
Is the heart to be beggared because the foot is large Why should
maturity, united with worth, be husbandless By a bountiful provision of
Nature, mediocrity of person is commonly combined with plenitude of
pocket. We know how transitory is beauty. The handsome but penniless
youth will, if a philosopher, jump at good-nature, which, though ordinary,
is well off. To unite comely indigence with wealthy plainness is, therefore,
one of the principal objects of Punch's Grand National Union Wife
Agency and Assurance Company.
The Company's Terms.
The payment of the sum of One Guinea annually, for bachelors or
widows, of Twenty-one Years of Age, and an extra Half Guinea for every
additional Ten Years of life, will secure the Assured the yearly refusal of
One Wife each. Two refusals to be had for double that amount of
Assurance; and so on in proportion. Policies of One Hundred Guineas
and upwards to entitle to a bonus of refusals, in the ratio of ten per cent.
The object of the Assured, whether Beauty or Competence, to be stated
on effecting their insurance; and strict regard will be paid to it. Those
desirous of both to pay double premiums. For the accommodation of
persons anxious for immediate felicity, a large number of HANDs will be
constantly ready for disposal, on the following scale of fees:—

which he anticipates, and to prevent obstruction in the street, he intends
to open a new office shortly in some more commodious situation. Further
particulars will be duly announced.
N.B.-The amiability of all wives guaranteed, if required, on payment
of One Shilling Extra.
AMERICAN HONOUR.
The Americans have raised a loan, but it is out of their own pockets.
They have been lending each other money, but it is only to decoy others
to do the same. The accomplices of a thimble-rig proprietor lend money
to each other for the purpose of drawing on the bystanders to play the
game. Such is the intention, no doubt, of an American loan, raised out
of the pockets of the Americans. If other nations are inclined to trust
them, the Yankees will make themselves safe, and then—repudiate.
CARRied without A Division.
If by chance, the pea is discovered under the right thimble, the pro-
prietor of the “rig" instantly commences a row, upsets the table, loses
the pea, pockets the cash, and, in a word, repudiates. In fact, repudiation
is a convenient mode of disposing of sundry small claims ; and as America
has tried it on a large scale, we strongly recommend its application to
smaller matters—such as tailors' bills, and the claims of one's landlord.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
MR. PRICE, the celebrated Old Bailey barrister, intends taking out
a patent for a new method of combining in one individual the threefold
offices of laundress, charwoman, and clerk. The learned gentleman has,
we believe, left the circuit mess, having got himself into a mess exclu-
sively his own.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A POLITICAL LEADER.
s the time for the meeting of Parlia-
ment draws near, we naturally place
the spectacles of consideration upon
the nose of doubt, and, taking a pinch
from the snuff-box of reflection, we
cut out with the scissors of memory
scraps from the history of the past,
to paste them on the blank leaf of the
mind as a guide to the future.
When we think of the glorious
revolution of '88, and reflect on the
fate of the brewer of Huntingdon,
who rose from the mash-tub almost
to the throne—when we remember
that he left the sweet-wort of his
trade to taste all the bitterness of
politics, when we ruminate on all
this—it is then, and then alone, that we feel what we really are by
comparison with what we might have been.
When the last of the Stuarts resigned his ashes to the papal under-
takers, the cause of the Pretender was buried in his stately tomb,
and neither the policy of a pontiff, nor the mutability of a mob, could
henceforth aid the successors of James, of whom it has been justly
said by a writer of his own time, that, “had he died as he lived, his
death and his life would have been at least consistent with each
other.” Now, however, the spirit of the nation is changed; and when
posterity sees the future, it will wonder at what will hereafter be
regarded as the past, though we only view it as the present.
We had commenced this article with the intention of laying down
a short synopsis of the political principles which, during the year
that has just commenced, we intend to advocate. On questions of
domestic policy our maxim will be this—“Let party look to party,
but let man consider only the interest of mankind.” This will give
Sir Robert Peel an insight into the course we intend to pursue with
reference to the Irish Question and other great matters of what we
may justly designate as our home politics. On foreign questions, we
shall bear in mind the advice of Talleyrand, who, when asked what
he thought, replied that he never thought of being asked—and hence,
perhaps, his success in the difficult game of diplomacy.
Our colonial interests require an explicit avowal of our sentiments;
and we therefore at once declare, that while “ships are but ships."
—to use the beautiful truism of the immortal Shakespeare—we
would rather see civilisation cultivated at home than plant the
British standard on the remotest rock that seas ever swept, or that
hurricanes ever howled upon.
Such are our political opinions on some of the most prominent
subjects that are about to occupy the attention of Parliament. If
we do not obtain friends, let us at least avoid making enemies, or, to
use the beautiful allegory of the Persian dervise, “If Allah denies
us champagne, let not Vishnu refuse us sparkling gooseberry.”
A NOTION FOR THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY.
our Punch, reader, in making the circuit
of Grosvenor or Belgrave Square, has
often found himself stopping, in company
with the little boys, opposite to the portal
of some lordly mansion, to contemplate
the living ornament reclining against the
door-post. In other words, he has stood
and stared at the footman. What has
attracted the attention of Punch, and, he
concludes, that of his young companions,
has been the extraordinary appearance
of the object. The hair, frizzled, poma-
tumed, and powdered ; the green, blue, or
red coat, with the collar of it of one colour
and the rest of another; and the gamboge
or crimson breeches, presented so striking
a spectacle, that he could not refrain from
gazing at it.
Being not less apt to reflect than to observe, he could not, likewise, but
ask himself to what end was the exterior of the John or Thomas before
him rendered so studiously eccentric What, for example, could be the
use of that bunch of bell-rope on the man's shoulder; and why was his
head disfigured in that fashion ?
Is the footman to the aristocratic establishment what the dummy is to
that of the tailor—an evidence of the taste of the Proprietor Very
possibly ; but if so, would not master dress himself like man The Court
dress, to be sure, approximates to that of the footman. . But this resem-
blance is typical. The livery-like garb ; the tights, the buckles of the
lord equipped for the levee, are symbols. They are the outward and
visible signs of inward servility. His lordship, in the plenitude of his
loyalty, voluntarily-assumes the lackey. Graceful self-degradation
No. The footman's livery is emblematic. The shoulder-knot; the
cockade, are hieroglyphics. In a word, they are badges. Unfortunately,
however, the paraphernalia of shame are not always distinguishable from
the insignia of honour. The Chief of the Ojibbeway Indians, the other
day, saw Mr. Sykes, the porter, sitting in the Queen's gate, at Windsor
Castle, and because Sykes was stout and well-fed, and withal wore a
scarlet uniform and a gold-laced hat, he mistook him for some great
nobleman, and made obeisance to him accordingly. Very probably the
porter looked a great deal finer than anybody else on the premises, so
that the mistake of the Indian was far from unnatural.
Such mistakes, however, are awkward. Liveries should speak un-
equivocally for themselves. Thoroughly to effect this desirable object,
Punch humbly offers to the aristocracy, the following model of a costume
wherewith to decorate their menials.
Instead of simply powdering and plastering the footman's hair, let it be
also tied in three portions, two to project laterally from the head, and one
to stand up perpendicularly, as a top-knot.
Let the flour-dredge be likewise applied to the face; or, which will be
better, let that part be overspread with a white pigment, which will less
easily rub off. º the cheeks be adorned with triangular spots of red,
and the mouth encircled by a margin of the same colour.
Let the outer garments consist of a linen tunic, tight at the waist ; and
wide bagging nether garments of the same material ; both spotted with
various colours. The neck and knees are to be adorned with a fringe or
frill. The stockings shall be encircled with broad ribs of different tints;
and the chaussure is to consist of red morocco, with clocks outside the
ancles.
The head-gear—(to trespass slightly on a princely province)—shall be
conical in form, parti-coloured, bedecked with ribbons, having bells
affixed to it, and being adorned by ear-like appendages at the sides.
If the readers of Punch know to what kind of character this dress has
been generally deemed appropriate, they will not fail to perceive how
great an improvement it will be on existing liveries; how much more ex-
pressively it will denote the difference in the scale of humanity between
master and servant; with how much greater force it will impress the
latter with a sense of his condition; and withal, how funny and diverting
a fellow it will make him look.
isord Brougham and the Foxes.
“LoRD BRough AM,” says the Sémaphore of Marseilles, “has just pur-
chased a forest in France full of foxes.” His lordship will himself super-
intend the education of these interesting animals. His proficiency in the
old Fox school of politics will enable him to give lessons in cunning even
to Mons. Reynard.
remarkable Instance of Gratitude.
Boy Dick begs to acknowledge the receipt of threepence, as conscience-
money, being the value of a Number of “Punch's Almanack,” which an
elderly gentleman confesses to have read, at the rate of a month per day,
through the shop-windows.

THE CIVIC PRETENDERS.
CoNSIDERABLF excitement has been occasioned in the City by a sort of
Legitimist movement in favour of Alderman Thomas Wood, who by right
of succession is entitled to the Civic Sovereignty. It is true that circum-
stances conspired to seat Magnay on the Mayoral throne, but several of
the old cockney noblesse insist on the claims of the pretender Wood,
being paramount. By many; the present monarch of the City is openly
denounced as Magnay the Usurper—and it is declared by several, that
Wood is de jure king of the City, while Magnay is de facto king of the
citizens. Encouraged by the example of the Duke of Bordeaux, the
city pretender–Wood—is trying to rally round him as many as possible
of the civic Legitimists, and he holds a levee every morning at his office.
A good deal of the jure divino feeling exists in the Poultry, which is to
the City what La Vendée was to France in the days of the Revolution.
THE DUCAL HAT FOR JENKINS.
WE hasten to lay before our readers the following ill-spelt and
worse-conceived communication. It came to us by our usual
express, through Lord Lowther's office in St. Martin's-le-Grand. It
was sealed with a large, we may say an enormous, circular seal, on
which are emblazoned the royal arms of England, and in all respects
similar to that with-some-people-very-uncommon-coin the half-crown.
But though the appearance of the seal may have deceived the young
gentleman in our office (who, from taking several hundred thousand
half-crowns for “Punch's Pocket-Book,” ought to have known the
coin better), to our more acute eyes the flimsy deceit was at once
apparent.
We unhesitatingly pronounce the letter AN AUDAcious for GERy;
and, in the words of the great bard, “would whip the rascal with
his clothes off through the world”—or at least down the Strand as
far as Charing Cross—did we know him, and were he inclined to
submit to the punishment. As, however, he would probably resist,
and as we are not acquainted with him, we leave him to the pangs of
his own conscience and the opprobrium of an indignant public.

FOUR-AND-TWENTY LEADERS
or THE “ MoRNING Post" in four-AND-Twenty successive DAYS | 1
The result of the “fool-hardy wager,” announced in our last, came off,
as proposed, at Herne Bay. The daring Waiter was in capital condition,
having had a week's hard training upon the Metropolitan Magazine.
We give the result of each day's reading:—
The First Leader.—The Waiter went off in capital style, getting over a
line a minute. This continued for five minutes, when he began to show
slight signs of fatigue. However, the task was completed in gallant style
in about 10hs. and 45m.
Second Leader.—The subject, being Puseyism, severely tried the
waiter's powers of endurance. He seemed to get over it with extreme
difficulty, pausing every minute to take breath, and a cup of strong tea,
but accomplished his Herculean labour five minutes before midnight.
Third Leader.—(This day, 10 o'clock, A.M.)- The Waiter has sent out
for an ounce of snuff, and seems to be dreadfully punished. Wet towels
and bags of ice have been applied to his temples, but the drowsiness
increases with every line he reads. A Quaker has threatened to inform
against the parties for their inhumanity, unless a copy of Punch is
instantly substituted for the Morning Post.
1 o'clock P.M.–The Waiter is fast asleep. An ophicleide has been tried
to arouse him, but it only elicits a loud snore. He breathes very hard,
and seems to be in great pain. His ravings are fearful, consisting of ex-
tracts of the different leaders. The one Policeman (A 1), of Herne Bay,
has been sent for the surgeon,
5 o'clock.-The Waiter has just evinced slight signs of returning anima-
tion: a visiter at the hotel having shouted in his ear—“John, here's half-
a-crown for you !”
PUNCH'S NAVAL SONGSTER.
A float, ashore, ahead, astern,
With winds propitious or contrary,
(I do not spin an idle yarn,)
No—no, belay ! I love thee, Mary.
Amidships—on the Bentinck shrouds,
Athwart the hawse, astride the mizen,
Watching at night the fleecy clouds,
Your Harry wishes you were his'n.
Then let us heave the nuptial lead,
In Hymen's port our anchors weighing;
Thy face shall be the figure-head
Our ship shall always be displaying.
But when old age shall bid us luff,
Our honest tack will never vary,
But I’ll continue Harry Bluff,
And thou my little light-built Mary.
Important to Skaters.
The proprietor of the Glaciarium has sent in a contract to Government
for freezing the Serpentine in Hyde Park for the winter.
A WEEK AT CHELSEA.
Monday.—Arrived by the Lily, after a boisterous passage of five-and-
twenty minutes from London Bridge, the wind right in our teeth, and the
water left in our eye.
Tuesday.—Walked for several hous on the shore, conversing with the
natives.
Wednesday.—Obtained a guide, who conducted me to the Old Bun
House. Bought a bun, and talked with the proprietor, who repeated to
me the legend of the Old Bun.
Thursday.—Strolled towards the hospital.
treated him to drink, and fell out with him.
Friday.—Visited the waterworks, having had an introduction to the
head turncock. Found him an intelligent man, and enthusiastically
devoted to his profession. He was averse to mere mercenary considera-
tions; and when I touched on the amount of the rates, he turned off the
conversation by turning on the water.
Saturday.—Paid another visit to the Bun House, but made no purchase.
Found the proprietor not so communicative as before. Alas! how can I
have offended him But it is ever thus. How true are the beautiful
words of the poet—which I forget.
Sunday.—Remained at home at my lodgings.
Monday.—Went back by the Thunder, heartily tired of my WEEk Ar
Chelsea.

There are many popular errors relative to this useful animal which the
author takes this opportunity of correcting. Coleridge talks of its “asking
footsteps,” and Wordsworth speaks of the “pivot of its skull,” and its
“staring bones.” The author can assure the public that the asses foot-
steps never speak, that its skull has no pivot, and that he never saw its
bones staring.
It is also a common belief amongst the vulgar that the Ass never dies,
forgetting the Dead Ass mentioned by Sterne, and the impossibility of the
author's immortality.
3.Fasbíonable Intelligence
The practice of fitting up residences in the Italian style has been fol-
lowed by Mr. Timkins, the Common law clerk in the respectable office of
Slash and Sellemoff. Mr. Timkins having heard much of the splendid
palazzi at Venice, has aimed at rendering his apartment as Venetian as
possible, and has already covered the floor with some Venetian carpeting.
The window is fitted with a Venetian blind ; and in order that the Italian
character of the room may be as much as possible preserved, he has
placed an Italian iron over the chimney-piece. -
HOMAGE TO NATIVE TALENT.
As an additional attraction to the performances of the Indians, Mr.
Ferrand has been engaged by Mr. Catlin to “throw the hatchet.” From
the wonderful perfection Mr. Ferrand has attained in this art, it is ex-
pected he will throw the hatchet much further than any Indian has yet
accomplished, by introducing at each performance a new anecdote about
the Anti-Corn Law League.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE NINTH...-OF SUBORDINATE MAGISTRATES.
Wr have hitherto considered only the Chief Magistrate, but we now
come down to the subordinates; and when we say that we shall begin with
the Sheriff, the drop from the throne to the shrieval office-stool appears
indeed terrible.
First, of the Sheriffs. The Sheriff is an officer of very great antiquity,
his name being derived from two Saxon words, which we don't print,
because if we did, we could not read them ourselves, and we think the
reader would find himself in the same predicament. In Latin, he is
called Vice-Comes, or Deputy of the Earl—though literally it means
Wiscount; but Wiscount Moon, or Wiscount Rogers, would sound so absurd
that the term Vice-Comes is no longer applied to a sheriff. The Earls
formerly did the duties themselves; but, finding that there was now and
then a man to be hanged, the Earls turned the matter over to the
sheriffs, who afterwards relinquished the task to Jack Ketch, the
Sheriffs only reserving the right to introduce their friends to illustrious
criminals.
The Judges now choose the Sheriffs; but in the time of Henry VI., the
king having tried to make a sheriff, was told, he could not by Sir John
Prisot and Sir John Fortescue, who delivered—pro-
bably in a duet like the following—the opinion of all
Sir John Prisot. \
You must not mention it.
-
Oh, no.
Sir John Fortescue.
Your Majesty has err'd.
Sir John Prisot.
A sheriff you can never make,
Sir John Fortescue.
You can't, upon my word.
Both together.
From book to book we’ve search'd all day,
And have perused a set
Of old reports—but cannot find |
A King-made sheriff yet.
Notwithstanding this judicial distich, the King
occasionally amused himself by making a sheriff, and
even to the present time what are called pocket-
sheriffs are now and then manufactured by the hands
of Royalty. The Sheriff, like the sunflower, lasts
only a year, though he partakes occasionally of the
holly-hock, which may be cut down one year and
spring up the next, for a sheriff that has blossomed
once may again flower with shrievalty.
The Sheriff is like a telescope, a pencil-case, or a
trombone, including two or three official divisions in
one, and requires drawing out before he can be fully
appreciated; for he is a judge, a keeper of the peace,
and a bailiff.
Hisjudicial capacity is often a good deal like judicial
incapacity. It was formerly limited to forty shillings,
which was about as much as it was worth ; but it has
since been extended to twenty pounds, by virtue of
a writ of trial.
As the keeper of the King's peace, the Sheriff is,
for the time being, the first man in the county; that
is to say, he is expected to be the first to rush on at
a row, when there is a probability that the only advan-
tage in being the first man in the county will be the
rivilege of being the first to get his head broken.
#. is bound to pursue and take all traitors: so that
if Sheriff Moon should happen to see a traitor stand-
ing at the corner of Threadneedle-street, he (Moon)
would be bound, as Sheriff, to bolt after him. He may also summon the
posse comitatus, or, in other words, call upon the tag-rag to assist him in
capturing or pursuing a felon. The Sheriff, however, cannot try criminal
offences; “For,” says the facetious Fortescue, “it would be too much of
a good thing that the Sheriff should try a man first, and hang him after-
wards; for of course, having to hang him, he has a direct interest in
finding him guilty.”
The Sheriff is also bound to execute all writs; and for this purpose he
has officers called bailiffs, who frequently undergo martyrdom at the spout
of the pump, and pass through other ordeals in their endeayours to catch
that particular bird which their writ indicates. “The Under-sheriff.”
says Dalton, “is derived from the old Saxon word Under, signifying
beneath, and Shriff or Shreff, which means the Sheriff.”
After the Under-sheriff and the Bailiff, comes the Gaoler, “an officer.”
says Coke, “who is the have ye to the bailiff's catch, ye ; for he keeps
C -
the judges:– THREE NEEDTLE

Meet in tke
fast or has in custody the bird that the bailiff has caught; and as there is
no catch ye no have ye, so the gaoler, who doth have the gaol bird, would
be useless without the bailiff who doth catch him.”
We now come to the Coroner, whose office is very ancient; and indeed
the Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench is ex officio the chief coroner
in the kingdom, so that it really—semble that Lord Denman might insist
on sitting upon any º, whenever he happened to feel an inquisitorial fit
come over him. The Coroner is elected by the freeholders; and formerly
none but a discreet Knight could be chosen. In these days, however, a
discreet Knight is not often to be found, and the office of Coroner is con-
sequently given to mere Esquires, in whom discretion is not looked for.
If any person dies suddenly, the Coroner must sit on the body, where the
death happens; but, if a man is drowned by falling into the sea, it does not
appear that the Coroner is bound to dive after the body and sit upon it.
Another branch of his office is to sit upon wrecks—which can only be
done when the top of the mast is sufficiently out of the water to enable
the Coroner to sit in safety. He is also to inquire about treasure trove—
which gives him jurisdiction over mudlarks, who seek for coals at low-
water, and bone-grubbers, who rummage in dustholes.
We now come to Justices of the Peace, who are a very miscellaneous
set, beginning with no less a person than the Sovereign, and finishing
with the Solons who adorn the various benches of Magistrates. The duty
of a Justice of the Peace is, to suppress riots and affrays, and to hear and
determine felonies—but if a justice sees an affray, he is often too much
afraid to rush in and put an end to it.
After the Justice comes the Constable—a genus ºf
K%:
|º
E.
|
which there are two species—the High and the Petty. The Petty Constable
is as old as Alfred, but how old Alfred might have been, we are unable to
say with certainty. The Constable is armed with very great powers; and
there is one at the Burlington Arcade who is armed with an instrument
of slaughter, but, happily for the nation, he never uses it. Nevertheless,
when the constable has nothing better to do, he may be seen breathing
on the brass nob, and rubbing it up with his pocket handkerchief.
The Surveyors of the Highways form the next branch of subordinate
magistrates; and their duty formerly was to call the inhabitants of the
parish ºff. and order them to bring materials for repairing the
roads. If this were now the case, the Dukes of Cambridge and Devon-
shire would be obliged to contribute a few blocks of wood to pave Picca-
dilly. To avoid this sort of inconvenience, a paving rate has been
imposed; though there is no doubt that any inhabitant might claim the
provisions of the statute of Henry the Eighth, and insist on mending his
own ways, instead of paying a rate for doing so.

Lastly, we will consider the Overseers of the Poor, who sometimes
literally over-see or over-look the cases of distress requiring assistance.
The poor law of Elizabeth has been superseded by a much poorer law of
William the Fourth, the one great principle of which is to afford the
luxury of divorce to persons in needy circumstances. It also discounte-
nances relief to the able-bodied, a point which is effected by disabling, as
far as possible, anybody who comes into the workhouse. The Poor Law
is administered by three Commissioners, who spend their time in diluting
gruel and writing reports—trying experiments how little will suffice to
prevent a repeal of the union between the soul and the body.
LITERARY TAVERNS OF LONDON.
The MITRE IN FLEET-STREET.
he Mitre, in Fleet-street, is
remarkable for Johnson having
used the house, and very pro-
bably done the landlord. John-
son was, to say the truth, a
“do” of no common order;
and it is reported of him, that
when Boswell asked him why
he did not pay his score, he
replied, “Sir, I do not pay the
score, because I have con-
sumed the viands, and forgot-
ten the items.”—“Then, Sir.”
rejoined Boswell, “you think
we are not bound to pay for
these indulgences?”—“No,
Sir,” said Johnson, “I did not
go so far as that ; but if we pay
what we have, we cease to pos-
sess that which is of value, and
which it is our duty to keep, that we may be more valuable members of
society.”
To fºrm, however, to the Mitre—which Johnson never did when his
score had reached a certain amount, until Boswell would go and . it
for him, or until the waiter had left to whom the great lexicographer
owed it. The Mitre, according to a recent magazine article, has a corner,
known as Johnson's corner, which is so sacred that no one is allowed to
sit in it. This corner is supposed to be the site on which the gas-pipe
has since been erected
The late owner of the Mitre was not aware that the house was
famous as the rendezvous of Johnson, until once asked by a customer
where Johnson generally sat, when the host, replied, that “so many
people came there whom he did not know, that he could not say which was
'Mr. Johnson's usual place of sitting.” On the matter being subsequently
explained to him, he saw the necessity of reading the subject well up, and
he never took a waiter without examining him in the four first chapters
of Boswell. The bust of Johnson, by Nollekens, and the portraits of
Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, by somebody, over the fire-place in the lower room,
added to the second-hand edition of the lexicographer's life, on the chimney-
piece up-stairs, has turned the Mitre into a perfect Johnsonian Museum.

ELF-INTEREst, MR. FDItoR, is the last motive that
induces me to publish to an invalided world ar
account of the astounding properties of my new
and highly improved, patent self-acting Americano

few letters of testimony from three undergraduates
and one bed-maker; all of whom have received
soul-invigorating scintillations of intellect from my
vapours.
LETTER I.
Peterhouse, Jan. 12th.
DEAR MAC Boileau,-It is now two months since I first enshrouded
me in the genial folds of your vapour-bath. My degree was at hand, the
betting in my college was three to one, and no takers, in favour of my
getting the “wooden spoon.” On reading my hydrostatics, I found that
dense bodies expand by heat; and your advertisement told me that the
mind also expands under the action of vaporeal caloric. . I now made up
my mind, and book, and, as you are not ignorant, was shortly 71.15s. in
your debt for vapour-baths. After the first three, my head grew palpably
clearer, and I got up my “pump and syphon” with ease; and on returning
from the fourth experiment, got completely * a “Cassegrain's
telescope,” till I came to the negative eye-piece. I easily saw through
this ; and thus, after repeated steamings, escaped “the spoon” by three
places. When my bets are paid, I shall clear ten shillings, at which period
I shall not fail to discharge your bill. I beg you will make what use you
please of this communication, and believe me,
Your obliged patient,
W. GRENohn.
LETTER II.
Trinity Coll., March.
SIR,-The use of your vapour-bath has quelled my quondam spirit of
pride, and I now confess that three months ago I was a fool—a dunderhead,
at whom sizers sneered. My “Little-go” was at hand—plucking seemed
inevitable, when Providence sent me your list of prices. On using the
bath, my ignorance seemed to ooze out with each globule of perspiration.
Need I add that I passed through the examination like greased lightning 1
My uncle has in consequence come down with the tin, and paid all my
bills—entirely owing to your stunning apparatus. Oh I publish my grati-
tude, adored Mac Boileau, and believe me, till my next bath,
Yours everlastingly,

BIOGRAPHY OF Howqua.
This great character is chiefly remarkable for the mixture—sold only
in catty packages. He is said to have concocted it during a morning's
in his own tea-garden. Howqua is reported to have been a man of
quickness, which was manifested in his refusing to be a vehicle for sloe—
or in other words a slow coach—an accusation which no one ever thought
of bringing against him.
As a literary character, we know little of him. His writings are sain
to be numerous, but all we have seen of them consists of a sheet of
hieroglyphics, in which old snuffers, half-open razors, and other articles,
said to form the richness of the Chinese language, are extremely proni.

In the meantime JENKINs, in the modesty and forbearance of his
soul, contents himself with making memoranda of the omens of the
glad event. On Twelfth Day, young HARRY, a guest at the Duke
of SoMERs ET’s, “drew the King " The incident, which has thrown
Louis-PHILIPPE into a bilious fever, is thus chronicled :—
“A circumstance occurred during the evening which excited considerable sensation
among the distinguished guests of the Duke and Duchess of Somerset. The old English
custom of drawing characters on Twelfth-night formed a portion of the evening's enter-
tainment. The illustrious Prince was pleased to take a share in this lottery, and to the
Pleasure and surprise of all present drew forth the “ king... The announcement of this
good augury” evidently excited the greatest satisfaction, and, but for the rigid
etiquette attendant upon the presence of the illustrious guest, the company would have
burst forth into a spontaneous expression of their enthus...ism.”
The “augury” is most convincing. From the cake to the throne
there is but a step. The DUKE having got his character and his
Twelfth-cake slice, may—
“—put in his thumb,
And pull out a plum,
And say, what a great king am I?’”
HENRY is already the JAck HoRNER of potentates, according to
the Morning Post. That every person present, at the cost of much
physical suffering strangled a spontaneous enthusiasm, is a truth
gathered by the industry of JENKINs from all the guests individually;
and, considering that enthusiasm very rarely intrudes itself upon the
decorum of high life, the sacrifice must have been—as the linen-
drapers placard it—“enormous.” The “augury” is, however, of
sufficient importance to quicken all the philosophy of Punch there-
upon. BAYLE himself (who loved Punch, by the way, as every truly
wise philosopher must) would have spread himself into a voluminous
essay on the matter. Punch will confine himself to a single leaf.
The extraordinary accident which placed the character of King
(must we say for that night only t) in the hands of the Duke, is only
paralleled by the strange event which, when MARc Antony was
one day fishing with CLEoPATRA, hung a red herring at the old
Roman's hook. SHAKspERE records the fact :-
Charmain. 'Twas merry, when
You wager'd on your angling , when your diver
Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up!
That the King should have fallen to the fingers of HENRY was
doubtless as purely accidental as that the red herring (for the Syn-
cretics have proved it to be red herring) should have been hooked
by Antony. Neither the Duke of SoMERset nor the Duchess knew
anything about it : “chance governed all.” Let us, however, in the
spirit of philosophy, follow out the omen. The shotten red-herring,
the “flesh, flesh-fishified” by CLEoPATRA—“serpent of old Nile.”—
was a proper type of the salt old age of ANTony : the red-herring
was also ominous of the final spitting on his own sword by the undone
Roman. In like manner, the Twelfth Cake is crammed, as with
plums, with significant meanings, for young Bond Eaux.
And now does JENKINs look as wisely at the lump of cake as one
of TENIERs' water-doctors at a bottle, and would thereupon prophesy
the future. Punch will, for a few moments, borrow the mantle of
JENKINs, and read a royal history from the toothsome morsel of the
confectioner.
In the reign of HENRY the FIFTH (for reign he will—has he not
drawn King at the Duke of SoMEaser's 1) France will be a land of
sugar: the Twelfth Cake's sweet and snowy top doth give warranty
of it. And here pick we out a Surinam raisin, and prophesy that
France will colonise in the East, giving great umbrage thereby to
perfidious Albion. And here are currants from Zante, which tell of
pretty pickings by the fingers of France in Greece; and now doth
the pungent flavour of nutmeg warm our palate, and feel we assured
that France will triumph in the Spice Islands; and now we taste
cinnamon, and pray that the Dutch may keep Batavia free from
Bourbon lilies; and now there is a crumb of flour and bread, and we
feel that in the time of HENRY every French peasant will have a
yard-long loaf; and, the flavour of brandy warming our tongue, we
learn that the vine-growers of the South will be happy and free as the
bacchanals of old, and taxes be the portion only of the wicked. And
all this Punch—under the cloak of JENKINs—prophesies to France
from HENRY's lump of SoMERset's Twelfth Cake
But what is a Twelfth Cake without its images —What France
without its Bourbon noblesse—the aristocracy of the ancien régime 3
And here they are, on Henry's cake 1 The same familiar faces; the
same pulseless things of show—stately and frosty. Here they are,
some of them the proper plaster of Paris representatives of
Marquesses and Counts, who kissed hands in Belgrave-square, and
then returned to France to wait the advent of their true king ; (the
while they cultivate lilies in flower-pots.) And, all these images laid
by, forgotten in their old châteaux–HENRY THE FIFTH will cause
to stand again in their old accustomed places; things of a buried
age, forlorn and yet confronting the spirit of the present with the
foolish mummery of the past. There is plenty, sweetness, wealth,
for France, as foreboded by the cake; but then the cake must have
its images. The whole soil of France shall be candied with sugar;
but then the ancient images—the unpalatable, glittering insipidities
—must dominate above it.
The subject extends before us. We should like to have a Twelfth
Cake drawing by all crowned heads. We doubt not, as in the case
of HENRY of Bouabon, that the characters would sometimes be
drawn with a marvellous applicability. Nicholas, for instance,
might come up a turnkey; the Emperor of Austria a government
spy; Otho, of Greece, a pot-boy; Louis PHILIPPE a pawnbroker;
the Queen of Spain, not the young lady who talked pearls and
diamonds (as OlozAGA will testify), and—not to run through the
whole list—a Prince near Windsor, a hatter out of employment.
The American PREsident should, of course have a draw, and
would doubtless come up as Jeremy Diddler.
Truly, oh JENKINs there is sometimes great affinity 'tween Kings
and Cakes 1
PUNCH'S MILITARY BIOGRAPHY.
CAPTAIN POPKINS OF The GUARDS.
He subject of our present biography is a younger son
of the aristocratic house of Popkins, or—according
to some—De Popkins, a family that kept extremely
quiet during the Civil Wars; for we do not find it
mentioned in any of the heroic achievements of that
exciting period. By degrees the family lost the De,
and retained only the Popkins—under which name
a descendant of the younger branch carried on
business as a tobacconist. Being patronised by many
- of the aristocracy, probably on account of his high
birth, Hugh de Popkins—commonly called Popkins—realised a large
fortune; and, anxious to resume the chivalrous character which once
attached to the house, he bought a commission for our hero—who became
his country's hero, by entering one of the regiments of foot as a Cornet.
He soon began to distinguish himself, and attracted the notice of the
Colonel by the unexceptionable neatness of his bºots; while the suavity of
his “Carry-a-ha-hems,” “Present a-ha-a-hems,” won him the affection of
the men, the sergeants, and the corporals. Our hero was present in all
the mountings of the guard before the Inclosure in St.James's Park; and
when the regiment was ordered to Hounslow; it was Popkins who carried
the colours all the way in his right hand, without once shifting them over
his left shoulder. -- - -
Among other instances of tact and courage exhibited by Popkins, was
the beautiful manoeuvre of leading the retreat from the Parade to the
archway under the Treasury, amid a shower of hailstones that suddenly
poured down on the regiment. He was also present at the opening of Par-
iiament in 1842; on which occasion he sustained the whole weight of a
mob pressing on him from behind, and received the thanks of the officer in
command—conveyed through the medium of a pinch of snuff from the
colonel's own snuff-box. - -
In 1843 Popkins was rewarded with the rank of Captain, he having first
duly paid for it. If the time should arrive when the country can only be
saved by such men as Popkins, it is very probable that Popkins will be
preferred to effect that desirable object.
THE CLOCK OF ST. CLEMENT'S.
PUNCH has been accused of hitting this clock very hard when it was
down ; and it certainly must be admitted that it was wholly unable to
strike in return. We are happy to say that the wound has been followed
by the clock being at last wound, and we now offer to take it by the hands
in a spirit of friendship. We have been told that the long stagnation has
been caused by the absurd scruples of the pendulum, which refused to go
from side to side, lest it should be accused of inconsistency.
The public may not, perhaps, be aware that Alderman Gibbs' accounts
were published on the same day that the clock of St. Clement's Church
was set going. It is a singular coincidence, that two pieces of such intri-
cate machinery, which had been behind time for so long, should have
been wound up on the same day.

A LETTER
From an American Manager to his London Dramatic Agent.
DEAR KENNETH,
As “Infants” seem to be all the fashion with you, pray send
me one. We are tired of singers, tragedians, violin players, and lecturers
(“so much for Buckingham”). We want something we have not had
before. If you cannot get Lord Brougham to come, you must really book
me per next an “Infant.” I don't care if it is one that does not speak,
as long as it can dance,—or do something an Infant generally does not
do. My terms are, my bond for 50l. a night, unlimited pap, and board
and lodging for its nurse. Mind The child must be vaccinated.
I am, dear Kenneth,
Yours, next to insolvency,
Jonathan PRice.

very popular in Pennsylvania.
A SINGULAR MUMMY.
Last evening, at the Western Literary and Scientific Institution,
a numerous and fashionable assembly was entertained for upwards
of an hour by witnessing the unrolling of a mummy. The process
was conducted by Adam Rummedge, M.D., F.R.S., F.S.A., &c., the
eminent physician and antiquary. What rendered this exhibition
more than usually interesting, was the fact that the mummy was an
English one. The remains were those of an individual belonging to
a race anciently existing in this metropolis under the appellation of
Hackney Coachmen. |
Previously to the operation, an ingenious little lecture was
delivered by the learned doctor on the class of men to which the
deceased had belonged. He described them as corresponding to the
modern cabmen ; their employment having been to convey passengers
for hire, about town. Their vehicles, like the present cabs, used,
when disengaged, to be drawn up in rows on what was then, as now,
denominated a stand. The stand was always contiguous to a public-
house; and it was a singular fact, that the quality of the porter there
sold, was superior to that of any which could be procured elsewhere.
The Hackney Coachman was very bibacious in his-habits; not only
consuming some gallons of malt liquor daily, but also large quantities
of gin, of which fluid he was accustomed to take a small wine-glass
every now and then, as some people take snuff. In consequence of
this practice, the face usually acquired a purplish tinge, particularly
intense at the extremity of the nose, which, moreover, was for the
most part gurnished with cutaneous nodosities. The voice also con-
tracted a peculiarly mucous character, from the induration of the
membranes and ligaments of the larynx or windpipe, resulting from
the co-operation of alcohol and catarrh. The Hackney Coachman
was likewise known by the name of Jarvy, supposed to be a corrup-
tion of Jarvis, the surname of a celebrated member of the fraternity.
It was a mistake to suppose that Jarvy was a Stage Coachman; though
a coaching lord or baronet was certainly sometimes called a Jarvy.
For the preservation of the subject on the table, it was not easy to
account. The process of embalming prevailed among the ancient
Egyptians, and the bodies of individuals of the Royal Family of
England were generally embalmed; but it was not customary to
embalm Jarvies or Hackney Coachmen. The probability was, that
this man had expressed a wish to be buried in his ordinary attire;
and that the saturation of his whole frame by alcohol, consequent on
continual dram-drinking, had enabled it to resist decomposition.
Whether or not this was the case would presently be seen. Having
delivered himself to the above effect, the lecturer then proceeded to
unroll the mummy.
The deceased, upon a superficial examination, appeared to have
been a man of such extraordinary bulk, that to enter a common sized
door it would have been necessary for him to walk sideways. The
breadth of the body, inclusive of its envelopes, was at least a yard and
a half. The height was about five feet ten inches. The proportions
of the figure were quite indiscernible, the whole of it being incased
in a species of great coat or wrap-rascal, of a dingy-drab colour and
coarse texture, reaching quite to the feet. Around the neck was
twisted a voluminous cotton handkerchief, which seemed to have
once been variegated, and which concealed the whole lower portion
of the face. The head was surmounted by a hat, mapless, variously
indented, in hue ferruginous or rusty, with a brim of about eight
inches broad. It was surrounded by a faded band, beneath which,
in front, had been thrust a short pipe. The head-gear was drawn
down so far over the countenance, and the neckcloth came so high up,
that no part of the features was perceptible except the tip of the nose.
the Mu M MY.
The hat was first removed. It came off pretty easily; and beneath
it there was a red worsted night-cap in a good state of preservation.
The neckcloth was next unwound. It had been screwed up like a
rope, and was discovered to have formed no less than six circumvo-
lutions about the throat. In length it was nearly eighteen feet.
The removal of the great-coat was then attempted. Here occurred
a slight mistake, which was productive of some delay. Around the
shoulders, encircling the upper part of the back, almost as far as the
waist, and extending in front, on either side, nearly to the middle of
the breast, were several layers of cloth, each about two inches
shorter than the one beneath it, which at first were thought to be
separate garments, and were accordingly detached in succession,
but were found, in fact, to be integral portions of that with
which they were connected. These, Dr. Rummedge informed his
audience, must have constituted what was called the cape, which, as
history tells us, was worn by the Hackney Coachmen of antiquity.
They were in number about sixteen.
The great-coat upon being taken off was found to be about half-an-
inch in thickness. Its weight gave rise to much speculation with
respect to the relative strength of the generation then existing, and
the present.
Beneath the garment last mentioned, there was found a common
body-coat of ample dimensions, not a little the worse for wear.
Under this there were at least half-a-dozen waistcoats, which were
successively removed and exhibited, amid much laughter. The
outermost was very long, and unbuttoned at its termination. In the
pockets were found several turnpike-tickets, a screw of tobacco,
pronounced by the lecturer to be of the species termed bird's-eye,
and a document relating to a damaged watch, an establishment in
Theobald's Road, and five shillings.
The nether garments, as far as their colour was ascertainable, were
of a lightish brown, patched in some places, and requiring patching
in others. In one of their pockets were two-pence-halfpenny; and a
bad shilling in the other. Here the lecturer observed, that this
shilling had probably been received from an unprincipled fare. The
Hackney Coachman's hire was a shilling a mile ; that of the cabman

eightpence; to which circumstance the extinction of the former was
owing.
The boots were remarkable for the extreme thickness of their
soles, which amounted to one inch. Around the ancles was wound
a sort of cordage, as big round as a man's wrist, which, on exami-
nation, was found to have been composed of hay. Beneath this
were gaiters or leggings of brown leather, mended with black cloth.
The right arm was discovered to have been tattooed with the rude
outline of a horse, and, under that, with the name of John Wite
(query White), which, as the initials J. W. were also observed on the
corner of a handkerchief found in one of the eoat-tail pockets, was
probably the individual's name.

A LIBEL ON PUNCH.
THE following letter has been addressed by Punch to the Editor of
the Examiner:—
“SIR,--I am in the habit, as you know, of combining instruction
with amusement; but when I give instructions to my attorney, there
is no joke about it, and very little amusement to the party I pur-
pose proceeding against. In your paper of January the 6th, you
compared me to Gonzales Bravo, or Gonzales Bravo to me, which is
the same thing, though we are very different. I am advised that
this is a libel, and I therefore write to you, to advise you to retract
it. Lord Brougham, I know, threatened you with proceedings, which
he did not follow up, for he never can continue in the same mind
for six months together; but when I once begin, I never leave off,
as my interminable number of Numbers—to come—will testify. I
am fond of a good action ; and as I think I have a good action
against you, I mean to follow it up most scrupulously, which, in
legal matters, means without a scruple. When I have taken out
my writ, I hope you will let me know in what way I can serve you.
Ever, Mr. Eraminer,
Your obedient plaintiff,

ROYAL GIFTS TO THE OJIBBEWAYS.
“To what vile uses may we come at last.”—HAM Let.
The papers have very faithfully reported the fact, that her Majesty has
sent to the Ojibbeway Indians certain yards of the “Queen's plaid,” but
have failed to state that Prince Albert also accompanied the gift with one
of his own military caps for each of the male strangers. e are, ex-
clusively, enabled to give the letter of acknowledgment sent by the Red

SeasonABLE BENEvolence.—The proprietors of the Morning Herald

SHAKESPEARE AND THE TURF.
t is very much to be regretted that Shakespeare
did not, among the glorious creations of his brain,
favour us with a sporting character. That he
could have done so there is not a doubt, for his
beautiful little sketch of the Jockey in Richard
the Third—the well-known Jockey of Norfolk,
is a sample of what the Swan of Avon could have
done for the Turf, had he been willing to shed
over it the halo of his genius.
We never see the play of Richard, without
regretting that the part of Norfolk is not dressed
as Shakespeare wrote it, from top to toe, a jockey.
- - The crook-backed tyrant's command to Norfolk,
to “be stirring with the lark,” shows the sporting habits of the jockey,
who was known to be habitually ready for the lark, or a lark, on the
very shortest notice. Shakespeare could have given us a magnifi-
cent Sir Harry Beagle, and, had he lived in these days, would have
been the author of “Tom and Jerry.” Our own opinion of the jockey
in Richard is, that it ought to be played on horseback; and we hope
that Mr. Bunn, when he does the tragedy at Drury Lane, will not
only mount the piece, but mount the actor who is to represent
Norfolk.
PUNCH'S ENGLISH AND OUTLANDISH INSTITUTE.
SoME years ago, Mr. Silk Buckingham got up a public subscrip-
tion to buy him a ship, in which to sail round the world. He did not
sail round the world; but he is now getting all the world round him
at his new spec of the British and Foreign Institute.
Punch begs leave to say that he thinks of opening a public sub-
scription to buy him a boat to row round the Isle of Thanet, with
power to himself to decline buying the boat, and to sink the money.
Punch also contemplates starting an English and Outlandish Institute,
to which the public are invited to subscribe their money, publishers
to send their books, and noblemen to lend their names as patrons.
Everything sent is to be the property of Punch, but the subscribers
are to have the privilege of looking at it. A donation of twenty
guineas makes a life member; that is to say, if the Institute keeps
alive long enough to admit of the privilege.

THE OFFICE OF THE BUDE LIGHT.
This interesting structure is on the second or third floor of a house in
Waterloo Place. It is papered with designs—at three halfpence a yard—
from the Lowther Arcade ; and there is a table in the centre, formed
upon the model of those beautiful specimens of the antique in furniture,
which are displayed along the New Cut and Brokers' Alley. The office
stool is a quadrilateral erection, mounted on thin pilasters of wood, and
roofed in as it were, or thatched with a straw cushion, covered over with
stout black leather.
The duty of the person employed in the Bude Light Office it is impos-
sible for us to say; but the probability is, that watching the Bude Light
in the lamp opposite the Duke of York's column is the most onerous part
of the labour. This task, however, only calling on the clerk's energies
from dusk until midnight, it is a matter of curious speculation—almost as
curious a speculation as the light itself—to say what on earth the Office of
the Bude Light can be used for in the day-time.
A Wink as good as a Nod.

what on earth is the use of offering advice to those who, being deaf, can't

puts forth suggestions to the nearly blind; these suggestions being in-
tended, no doubt, for those who can see things with half an eye, which
is a convenient state of quick-sightedness to those who can hardly see
anything.

THE COLD WATER CLUB.
T is proposed to form
a club, to be called
the Cold Water Club.
Every candidate for ad-
mission must drink one
quart of cold water in
the presence of the
porter, and another
quart in the presence
of the committee, on
being proposed.
Life members must
drink a bucketful of
spring water in twenty-
four hours; and no one
is eligible to the com-
mittee who has not imbibed at least six pailsful of the element in
any given week. - -
The advantages of the club will consist of a reading-room, supplied
with all the newspapers, which will be kept damped, so that there
will be a continued supply of wet sheets. There will also be water-
spouts in various parts of the building, with the water constantly
laid on, for the accommodation of members wishing to stand under
them. Bath chairs will be placed in all the apartments, and the
furniture will consist of watered silk. Engines will be constantly
playing, in order to wet the appetite; and the moisture of the mem-
bers will be in every way provided for.
NO’ſ CE.
We mentioned, in a former Number of this periodical, that we
had engaged, at an immense outlay, and in accordance with the
wishes of a numerous class of the British public, A MoRAL You Ng
MAN, well known in the world of letters and newspapers, and enabled,
from his experience, his opportunitief, his learning, and his peculiar
turn of mind, to impart to our little journal that tone of gravity and
decorum which by some it has been found to lack. -
Before we gave his name to the public, we were willing to make a
trial of his capabilities in private : for though we had no doubt of his
talents, yet all talents are not suited to our paper If, as the Morn-
ing Chronicle somewhat impertinently says of our respected confrère,
his Excellency Senor Gonzales Bravo, “Punch is not fit to be prime
minister of Spain,” in like manner we answer, many a prime minister
is not fit to be editor of Punch. Sir Robert's jokes, however they
make the House of Commons laugh, would hardly be suitable to
the great, large, jovial, honest, laughter-loving public or Great
Bait AIN.
Our moral young man has undergone his preparatory ordeal.
That ordeal has satisfied his employers of the moral young man's
capabilities. That capability we think is proved by the following
papers; and of these papers we do not now hesitate to name the
illustrious author of “Paddington and its People,” as the writer.
In presenting the first series of his biographies to the public (to be
completed in many scores of volumes), we unhesitatingly declare
that his present work is distinguished by more than his usual accu-
racy of information, by more than his common splendour of diction,
and characterised by a passionate, an abounding, an outpouring,
a gushing, an overflooding, and overwhelming interest, such as
fiction would endeavour in vain to confer, and such as truth only can
command. -
In his literary lives, the Moral Young MAN naturally (and grace.
fully, as we think) begins with the people of title who adorn both
the Red Book, and the still more ennobling calendar of the Muses.
LEAVES FROM THE LIVES OF THE LORDS OF LITERATURE.

NEcnopolis,” Etc. Etc.
Blessington, The Countess Mangue atte of.-The author may
be a proud man whose work commences with such a name as that of
the above distinguished scion of the aristocracy. Sir Joshua Lawrence's
portrait of her ladyship, which has been engraved several times,
has rendered her form and features familiar to the British public,
and therefore I need give no portrait of them here—suffice it to say,
that both are (as far as poor human nature can be, and indeed which
of us is 1) faultless. Her ladyship's style of writing is ditto; and her
works, both of history and fiction, are ornamented with a great number
of phrases both in French and Italian, which sparkle through her
English like gems in the night. To the merits of these works the
whole British Press bears witness. “Brilliant, charming, elegant,
graceful,” are expressions, I may even say epithets, rung out in the
fair countess's praise by every critic in these dominions. Those gents
who bestow such laudatory compliments upon her ladyship's productions
are, I observe, rather shy of quoting anything from them. And why
—from envy to be sure, as I have often found in my own case; the
reviewers being afraid lest their criticisms should appear stupid and
uninteresting by the side of the writer's delightful text.
My avocations as a member of the press, and a leader of public
opinion, have prevented me from reading any of her ladyship's works;
and as I know nobody who has, I am not enabled to furnish the
reader with a catalogue of them.
Her ladyship's house is at Kensington, and is named, I understand,
after another fair authoress, who shall be mentioned in her place.
I do not visit there, and therefore of course cannot describe the
contents of the mansion : need I say I should be happy to do so
The Countess is a Peeress in her own right, and was elevated to
that dignity upon presenting one of her delightful and successful
novels to his late lamented Majesty George IV. Kneeling at the royal
feet to receive the Countess's Coronet, (which is always placed on
the head of the nobleman or lady at their investiture) the fair
Countess dropped one of her gloves; on which his Majesty, picking
it up, observed to Mr. Bentley, the respected publisher, who attended
with a copy, “Honi soit qui mal y pense.” This was the origin of the
Guelphic order. I have this story from undoubted authority—from
a gent indeed, who has written a good deal in Mr. B.'s Miscellany,
where I should be very glad to furnish articles at the usual remune-
ration per line.
Her ladyship, to conclude, is Editor of the well-known “Book of
Beauty” of which I cannot help remarking that the Beauties of late
years seem rather used up. Is it so indeed f Perish the thought, I
say. And the idea of the “Book of Beauty” naturally brings us to—
Baough AM, Lond HENRY-His lordship is, as the world very well
knows, a political, or what the admirable Morning Herald calls a lego-
political gent. He was educated at Edinburgh, where he became
acquainted with little Jack Horner, Judge Jeffries, Editor of the Edin-
burgh Review, and Admiral the Reverend Sir Sydney Smith, of whom
more anonymously. Having finished his studies, he was brought to the
bar in London, where he has distinguished himselfin various ways ever
since. Being born and bred in the North, his accent has stuck to him
like a burr, and he has used that tongue of his to more purpose than
any gent of the long robe. During the session, as the Times has
remarked of him, his labours are tremendous. You may see him in
the morning at the House of Lords, or in the Privy Council, the
eagerest among the Judges there; and all the time writing off articles
for the Edinburgh Review. In the evening, he is at the Lords again,
backing up his friend Lord Monteagle, to whom he is tenderly attached.
At night, I have myself enjoyed the pleasure of his company many
times at the Garrick's Head, in Bow-street, where he astonishes the
world by his eloquence. Such is only a part of the life of this rest-
less though brilliant genius !
His fatal attachment for Queen Caroline in early life, is well known;
and his duel with Mr. Canning, another ardent admirer of that fasci-
nating, though unfortunate, Princess. Hence his Majesty George IV.
could naturally never abide him.
King William IV. was passionately fond of him. When Lord
Brougham was Chancellor, he and his Sovereign corresponded regu-
larly by the post: both shed tears when obliged to part, especially

Lord Brougham, whose susceptible nature has, perhaps, never reco-
vered the shock since.
But it is as a literary man that we are called upon to judge him ;
and as such he has been at everything. “His lordship is a bird that
has hopped upon every branch of the tree of knowledge,” as Goëthe
observes: as Mr. S-m—l R—g—rs remarks, rather coarsely, he has
been at everything in the literary way, from p—tch and t—ss to
mansl—ghter. A politician, a theologian, an historian ; on classics,
optics, physics, metaphysics, he has wrote, and with unbounded
applause. All his works are to be had on all these subjects, and at
immensely reduced prices.
He is a corresponding member of three hundred and ninety-six
philosophical societies. He is the inventor of the Brougham car-
riages, for which every man that uses a cab may thank him. In fact,
an equestrian statue of him is to be set up in St. Martin's-lane, in a
Brougham carriage, as soon as anybody will subscribe for the purpose.
Coming to London with nothing on but a common stuff gown, he
rose himself to be Lord Chancellor—a lasting monument of genius !
He is a member of the Beef-steak Club, which he founded in con-
junction with Mr. Wilberforce.
He is equally distinguished in France (about which country, its
capital, Paris, and its people, Messrs. Saunders and Ottley have just
published a remarkable work). In France he is a member of the
National Institute, and also Drum-Major of the National Guards.

King Louis Philippe has had the above portrait of him put up at
Versailles. He has in that country a château at Cannae, where
Bonaparte landed, and where Cannibal the Carthaginian was defeated
by Scipio (no doubt another African) in the Roman service; and
there he cultivates the olive branches which he is in the habit of
presenting to King Louis Philippe and our gracious Sovereign.
Lord Brougham, unlike other great men, has no envy; no uncha-
ritableness; no desire to get his neighbours' places, or to oust his
friends. Indeed, his very enemies admire him more than anybody
else; and, can there be a greater proof of his disinterestedness t
There is no truth in the report that, jealous of Mr. Macready's popu-
larity, he proposed to take an opposition theatre, and play the prin-
cipai tragic parts there. His talents are not dramatic. He once
wrote a little comedy of intrigue, called “The Queen has done it All,”
but it was miserably hissed off the stage. And finally, to speak of
him as a literary man, he has been so constant a contributor to Punch,
and has supplied the inimitable H.B. with so many designs, that every
lover of humour must admire him.
BRoun, SIR Thomas.-I know nothing of this titled gent, except
that he is secretary of the Society of Baronets of England, of which
I know nothing too. This society, or this secretary, has discovered
the rank of Baronetess, the right of the Baronets to wear the Ulster
Badge, and what is called the collar of SS.
Sir Thomas Broun has wrote a book upon the above interesting
subject, which brings him into our literary category; and which,
whenever her Gracious Majesty shall please to call me to the order,
I shall read with pleasure.
It is not generally known, that when the meeting of Baronets ap-
plied to our beloved Sovereign for permission to wear the collar of
SS., she graciously granted the privilege, with the addition of A (the
first letter in the alphabet) to be worn before the SS in question. I
have not heard whether the collars have as yet been worn; but—
speaking of Baronets—come naturally, as well as alphabetically, to
the celebrated
Edward, Earl Lytton Bulwen, who is the next noble on my
proud list of fame. As an Earl—and his title was actually conferred
upon him at his baptism—he could not sit in the House of Commons,
and therefore relinquished the vain rank of an hereditary aristocracy
to serve.his country in Parliament, which he did as member for
Liskeard. He was made a Baronet for his services there ; in compli-
ment to which he wrote his eminent work, “The Last of the Baronets.”
Messrs. Saunders and Ottley will, I dare say, be happy to supply any
of my readers with a copy of that performance at the usual moderate
charge.
Sir Edward's labours as an author have been multivarious. He
has written history, poetry, romance, criticism, politics, the drama.
He has had detractors—what great man has not I can speak
myself from bitter experience; but as long as he can get his present
price, which I have no doubt is a guinea per page per novel, I think
he may afford to laugh at envy. There's many a gent, I know,
would undergo a deal of similar persecution for a precious deal less
money.
Among the celebrated authors in this family may be also men-
tioned His Excellency Lord Henry Bulwer, the Ambassador to
Madrid, whose work on Paris and the Parisians is, however, altogether
inferior to a late work, published by Messrs. Saunders and Ottley;
viz. “Paris and its People;” and which that admirable journal, the
Morning Herald, says is to be found on every Englishman's bookshelf.
The English reader having it on his shelf, of course there is no
need to recommend him (unless he wishes to present it to a friend)
to purchase another copy, which he is at liberty to do. The rest
of Europe, however, had better give their orders early, as above.
And this information, I believe, is all that I have to give of the
celebrated author of “Pelham,” “England and the English,’ &c. In
person, I may add, he is stout and swarthy. He wears a blue coat and
brass buttons; boots named after the celebrated Prussian partisan,
Prince Blucher; silver spectacles, and drab trousers, very much
crunkled at the knees. He is about sixty-nine years of age, and lives
in Tibbald’s Row, Holborn—at least a gent going into a chambers
there was pointed out to me as this above-named pride of our country.
what is sauce for the Goose should be Sauce for the
Gander.
A person was brought the other day before ALDERMAN GIBBs, charged
with refusing to say who he was. The Churchwarden of St. Stephen's,
Walbrook, declared that he would detain the mysterious individual until
“he gave some account of himself.” This seems a little too bad, for
Alderman Gibbs ought to have shown some sympathy towards an indi-
vidual refusing, or being unable to give an account of himself. If the
Alderman were to be thus dealt with, it would amount to imprisonment
for life—if present appearances are to be relied upon.
Od, Rat it.
A Company has just been formed in Paris with an immense capital, for
the purpose of destroying rats. . If such a º were to be formed in
England, Lord Brougham, Lord Stanley, and Sir James Graham, would
be entitled to ask for protection from the magistrates, on the plea of their
lives being in danger.
New PATENT.-The Proprietors of the Wood Pavement have taken
out a new patent for paving the streets—with horses.

NELSON COLUMN COMMITTEE.
Ast week, at a Meeting of the Nelson Column
Committee, at the British Coffee House, the
Right Hon. Lord Gosoughtly in the Chair, the
Honorary Secretary, Delay O'Dawdle, Esq.,
read the following Letter addressed to him
from Mr. Benjamin Bookham, the portly Bus
time-keeper at Charing Cross:–
“SIR,-Hopin as how you will exqueege the
liberty I takes in ritin this ere to you and wich
eums to you now—I wants to no in regard off
wether afore you pulls down your scaffle poles
(wich same is wery old friends of mine) you

my wew of the Wite oss Seller and I cant tell wich Bus is a coming next
Please give it a reglar good shave
“i are sir yours til deth & hur” ºr
(Signed) “ rºws...AMIN BookHAM.’’
Addressed “to The Nelsun piller:” and sealed with a thumb nail,
On the motion of Soloman Slow, Esq., and seconded by Nicholas
Creeper, Esq., it was unanimously resolved,
“That Mr. Benjamin Bookham's request with regard to the cable,
which he had mistaken for a sack of sawdust, be acceded to ; and that the
Man and the Boy be at once ordered to the platforms forthwith ; and that
they report progress as to extent of reduction required that day six months;
and that they be allowed to call to their council Mr. Benjamin Bookham,
at the bar of the Silver Cross.”
After a vote of thanks to the Right Hon. Chairman, the Meeting
adjourned.
AN UNREPORTED POLICE CASE.
EstERDAY Michael Slippery was brought up at
Guildhall before Mr. Alderman Gibbs. Various
charges were made against the prisoner.
It appeared that the accused was treasurer to
Ebenezer Chapel, and, in that capacity, had
charge of all money for pews, moneys gathered
at charity and funeral sermons, &c., and of which
sums he resolutely resolved to give no account.
Mr. Alderman Gibbs, in a voice of much
emotion, asked the prisoner what he meant by
such conduct :
The prisoner, with much effrontery, answered, that he was not bound to
give an account to the parties applying; and he would see them in a very
incomfortable locality before he would satisfy 'em. He had elected his
own family—in all, with the baby, five persons—to audit the accounts; and
they hadn't a word to say against him.
Mr. Alderman Gibbs said, it shocked him more than he could express,
to see a man in such a situation. The worthy Alderman (wiping a tear
from his eye) entreated ºf to reconsider his determination. The
course he was pursuing was not the course of an honest man. , Scorn
would point her finger at him; he would become an outcast and a by-
word, and bring inevitable shame upon his old age.
Michael Slippery made no answer, but having placed the top of his
thumb to his nose, swaggered out of the office.
Mr. Alderman Gibbs—at the sight of such human depravity—burst
into tears.
Oſbe ſºirst Tºap of QIrrm.
THE Lord Chancellor having declined giving the Judges, Queen's
Counsel, and Sergeants a breakfast, in accordance with old custom, the
Queen's Counsel refused to put on their best wigs, and the Sergeants de-
clined sporting the scarlet toga. , Qur own standing Counsel came out in
a pair of clean bands, and had had his stuff gown scoured for the occasion,
being desirous to show the Chancellor that he did not participate in the
evident soreness of his seniors. We have been given to understand, that
the learned Lord on the Woolsack intends making up for the omission of
the breakfast at the beginning of Term, by giving a small tea-party at the
end of it.
The Height of Grandeur.
A writeR in a provincial paper, in an outburst of enthusiastic loyalty,
declared the other day that “our beloved Queen sits on the highest throne
in Europe.” This must be very inconvenient, considering that her Majesty
has not the longest legs, which, in order to sit at ease on the highest
throne, would certainly be required.
$ºltſjamírs' Hinstitution.
T a meeting held last week by a few of the
lecturers of the Mechanics' Institution, for
the purpose of examining such of the members
as were most zealous and frequent in their
attendance—
Jonas Clump was called in, and passed the
following creditable examination :-
“Is a wedgeable dealer in Clare Market, and
has been a member of the Mechanics’ Institu-
tion for three years. Has attended reg'lar. Knows what the mechanical
power is ; knows the Chartists and turn-outs of Manchester and the
man'fact’ring towns is mechanical powers.
“Know’d what the wheel and axle was. Had had many opportunities
of seeing of it; had often examined it under his own go-cart. Hadn't
cal'clated its power; in fact, had rayther looked to his hoss for the power.
“Didn't know exactly what the ‘wedge' was. Cal’clated its powers
was henormous. Was wedged in a crowd last Thursday arternoon at
Punch's office, and got well nigh spilt.
“Know'd a screw. His old uncle was a screw, know’d nothin' better; he
was a man with lots of means but no liberality, who always wanted more,
but didn't care what dirty way he got it in.
“The “lever * he had never seen. Know’d what a ‘balance' was ;
always liked to have it in his favour, particklar at the year's end. Had
never heerd of any “harm’ in the lever,
“Was quite ignorant of the pulley. Believed the inclined plane was a
carpenter's tool, but didn't exactly know.”
Jonas Clump then retired.
INSECTS AND THEIR HABITATIONS.
E have not read the book which has lately
been advertised under the above title ;
because we not only know as much as we
want to know, but also more than we
could have wished to know, about the sub-
ject of which it treats. Of this superfluity
of knowledge, we shall disburden our-
selves for the benefit of the world.
Among the insects with whom we have
formed a practical and by no means agree-
able acquaintance, are :—
1. THE SPIDER.—Is partial to lodging-houses; especially to those por-
tions of them which are tenanted by single gentlemen, where its reticular
fabric very often adorns every angle in the room. A favourite haunt of
the spider, is the book-shelf, where its web is too often observably ex-
tended over volumes of a moral and philosophical tendency.
2. The MITE-This interesting animalcule is gregarious in its habits.
We believe that no species of solitary mite exists. Mites live in colonies,
occupying large tracts of caseous formation, and principally the riper
strata. Our own observations, in common, we believe, with those of other
naturalists, have induced us to conclude that they prefer Stilton to
Cheshire; though we have not unfrequently encountered them in Chedder
and double Glo'ster; but never that we recollect in Dutch. The spectacle
of countless myriads of mites, with their innumerable eggs, all living
together in undisturbed harmony and happiness, must be a gratifying
spectacle to the benevolent mind, reflecting on a lump of decayed cheese.
3. The GRUB.—A member of this extensive family is often found in the
filbert. Its white annular body, and tiny black head, are well known. The
nut for some distance around the insect, is found converted into a black
powder, which is extremely bitter to the taste. It is therefore advisable
in extracting the kernel of the filbert to use the crackers instead of the
teeth. A pleasing amusement may be derived from placing a couple of
these insectile hermits on a table; and, forming a goal with a piece of
apple, to try which can reach it first.
On pinching the tail of the nut-worm, the creature will by its move-
ments, exhibit unequivocal evidences of sensation.
4. The CATERPILLAR lies rankling, oftentimes in the very heart of
the young cabbage, which it consumes like hopeless love. All cooks
should be aware of this circumstance, which we are very sorry that they
are not, or at least, that they do not always attend to it.
5. The Moth would seem to be an insect of Hebrew origin, from its
attachment to old clothes. How often has the suit, laid by for a few brief
years, been found when brought once more into request, to be the unwear-
able residence of this winged spoiler!
We cannot quit the subject of Insects and their Habitations, without
delicately hinting at the bedpost and blanket. We need say no more.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE TENTH.-OF THE PEOPLE. WHETHER ALIENS,
DENIZENS, OR NATIVES.
aving treated of the Sovereign, we now come
down to the small change, or in other words,
we turn from her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen, to his Most Miscellaneous Majesty
the people.
The people are divided into aliens and
natural born, though the latter are not neces-
sarily born naturals. Natural born subjects
are such as are born within the ligeance, or
allegiance of the Sovereign—but aliens are
such as are born out of it.
Allegiance is the tie which binds the subject
to the Sovereign, and the form is derived
from the Goths; who, under the feudal system, held their possessions
under some lord, to whom they were vassals. The only remains of
this system are to be met with at the Gothic Cottages in the Regent's
Park, the tenants of which swear fealty every quarter to the lord or
his house-agent. Formerly there was mutual trust between the tenant
of the soil and the owner, but this trust has been much broken in upon,
by the modern practice of “shooting the moon,” which hath destroyed
that sylvan state of simple confidence which formerly existed.
The vassal was formerly expected to defend the lord against his
enemies; so that if the landlord of a house got into a street row, his
vassals or lodgers were expected to take part in it. This was called
fidelitas or fealty, the tenant taking an oath to protect the lord of the
soil; but this is now commuted into an undertaking to pay the taxes,
including a police, rate, which secures the lord and the vassal also from
violence. The oath of allegiance to the Sovereign is still taken by attor-
neys and barristers, on being admitted to practise; but in consequence of
their number, it has been arranged as a solo and chorus for the officer of
the Court, and an unlimited number of voices, which chime in together,
expressing their horror of the Pope—without knowing who the old
gentleman is—and declaring that it is not lawful to murder foreign
princes in the public street—as if any one in these
days ever thought of assassinating continental
royalty in Regent-street, or any of the leading
thoroughfares.
It seems, however, that all subjects owe alle-
giance to the Sovereign, whether they have taken
the oath or not ; and it is very probable that the
ideas of most people would be much the same on the
slaughter of foreign princes, without going through
the ceremony of swearing the awful affidavit
alluded to.
Every person born within the English dominions
owes allegiance to the Sovereign from the moment
of birth, being at once under the protection or
particular patronage of royalty. The immense
uantity of allegiance payable from persons of large
}. may therefore be conceived; and it must
be held as a constitutional doctrine, that twins
cause a double accession of loyalty. Local allegiance
is something of the nature of portable gas, for it is
moveable, and only lighted up in the bosoms of aliens
during their residence in this country, after which
it may be turned off, or otherwise extinguished.
It seems that allegiance is as much due to the
usurper as to the rightful Sovereign, and must be
paid to whomsoever is on the throne for the time
being. If, therefore, a lunatic should get into the
throne-room in the Palace, and, sitting on the
throne, proclaim himself king, it would seem that
the royal housemaid would owe temporary alle-
giance to the madman, until a policeman should
regularly dethrone him, and walk the usurper off
to the nearest—that is to say, a much more humble
—station.
Allegiance is due to the person, and not to the
dignity alone ; for, in the time of Edward the
Third, the Spencers were banished for refusing allegiance to the person
of the King, and offering it to his crown, which was something like the
notion of bowing to Gesler's hat, which, through Sheridan Knowles's
“William Tell,” every one is acquainted with. The sad tale of these
Spencers led to the introduction of spencers with no tail at all, several
centuries afterwards.
Natural born subjects have rights that nothing but their own misbe-
haviour can forfeit; such as the right of buying lands, if they have got the
money to pay for them.
This glorious privilege may be enjoyed by the meanest subject, under
the circumstances last alluded to.
An alien may purchase lands; but if he does, the Sovereign is entitled
to them. Nevertheless, an alien may hire a house to live in, though the
King of the Belgians, when he first came to London as an alien, occupied
only lodgings, being those on the second floor of Hagger's oil and pickle
shop in Oxford-street. The Prince, who is now the lord of the Belgians
and their soil, was then the vassal of Hagger, to whom he did weekly
homage to the tune of thirty shillings.
An alien may trade freely; so #. Verrey dispenses dinners in strict
conformity with the provisions of our glorious Constitution.
Children born out of England, whose father or grandfather, by the
father's side, is in allegiance to the English Sovereign, are natural born
subjects; and therefore the summer visitors to Boulogne are in no danger
of producing a crop of young aliens,—a result which would deprive the
Sovereign of many subjects, and not only the Sovereign, but the Emerald,
the Sir William Wallace, the Grand Turk, and the Waterwitch, of a
great number of passengers.
The children of aliens, when born in England, are considered as natural
born, and Pagliano's Hotel contributes annually a large stock of subjects
to the British monarchy.
A denizen is an alien, who, by the Royal prerogative, is made a natural
—being, in fact, an animal something like a mule, which, being between
the horse and the ass, generally partakes mostly of the latter. The
denizen is indeed almost, not quite, a natural.
Naturalisation can only be achieved by Act of Parliament; but even
when naturalised, neither an alien nor a denizen can be a member of
Parliament, a dignity that naturals only are thought worthy of.
There have been one or two attempts to introduce an Act for the
general naturalisation of all foreigners; but the nearest approach to it is
the statute naturalising certain persons who have served two years in the
army or navy, and some who have been three years fishing for whales;
which really exhibits such a strong turn for natural history, that naturalis-
ation is the smallest compliment which can be paid to it.

So much for “the People,” who have always got a number of “People's

Post Office Intelligence.
Government having contracted for a mail to Sydney once a month,
all letters for that quarter must be marked “Overland, through Sydney's
Alley.”
Good Grounds for it.
Since our report of the “Daring Wager” at Herne Bay, all the back
Numbers of the Morning Post have been purchased by a wealthy Railway
Company, from the fact that the Post makes the soundest sleepers.

The above is a love song. Perhaps the strong Saxon of Hants may be
more appropriate to the sterner strains of war and patriotism. There is
one style of Poetry to which it is especially applicable, the Bacchanalian;
and, indeed, there are several very fine beer-songs, of a traditionary cha-
racter, still extant in the county. It is likewise adapted to pastoral
purposes. Seeing that “Nichts wi' Burns,” “Hours with Mary, Queen
of Scots,” and the like entertainments, have become so popular, would it
not be a profitable speculation for any competent person to give a “Neite

QºImibersity Intelligence.
The following questions have been privately sent us by the Cambridge
Moderators, as part of the examination for the candidates for the Poll
degree. Mr. Punch, always desirous of benefiting “Young England,”
lays these questions before his numerous readers.
1. Given the force, i.e. the weight in gold, of the salary of the Lord
Chancellor, and the time in which Lord Lyndhurst is expected to resign;
required the relocity with which Lord Brougham turns round from
Whiggism to Toryism.
2. Given the force with which your fist is propelled against a cabman,
and the angle at which it strikes him ; required the area of mud he will
cover on reaching the horizontal plane.
3. Show the incorrectness of using imaginary quantities, by attempting
to put off your creditors with promising to pay them out of your Pennsyl-
vania dividends.
THE PRIZE FOOTMAN SHOW.
The great success attending the Prize Cattle Show has induced a
body of enterprising noblemen, interested in the yet-youthful science
of Slaveyculture, to start the following show, the particulars of
which are subjoined for the benefit of rising Pages, and ambitious
Errand-boys:—
PRIZE HALL-Ponter.
1st Prise-É30, and a gold medal, to Sir G. Chokefull, Bart., for a
hall porter, aged 68: weighs 20 stone, fatted on 15,000 lbs. of roast beef,
cabbage, hot-rolls, and porter. Waddled to the show 100 yards, wheeled
in his chair the rest.
PRizr Footman.
2nd Prize.—£20, and a silver medal, to the Earl of Powdertax, for a
full-calved, long-backed London footman, 30 years old : fatted in
Grosvenor-square, on patties, sweetbreads, vol-au-vents, and other deli-
cacies, washed down by his master's best old Port. Travelled to the
show, hanging on, with two others, behind the carriage.

coach.
NEW ORDERS.
THE Emperor of Russia has just revived the Order of the Swan, and
we understand the following Orders will shortly be instituted in this
country :-
º, of the Lark-Grand Master, Lord Huntingtower.
The Order of the Goose.—Knight Commander, Colonel Sibthorpe.
The Order of the Swallow.—Members in ordinary, the Auditors of the
Accounts of the Churchwarden of St. Stephen, Walbrook.
I.ifts to Lazy Lawyers.
Q. What are mesne incumbrances !
A. Poor relations.
Q. What is a mortgagee in possession 1
A. An Uncle.
THE WEATHER.
ood MR. Punch,-Everybody is agreed on the
singular mildness of the season. The editor of
the something Herald is writing with a bunch
of precocious primroses lying before him; and
the conductor of the somewhere Express is
sniffing at a twig of May, forwarded to him by
a country correspondent. Mr. Tomkins, of
Hurleybury, has picked, in his own garden, a
green gooseberry as big as a marrowfat pea.
Mr. Redhead, of Hawthorndean, has a second
crop of Lilliputian apples in his orchard. Mr. Biggs has gathered
three ripe strawberries, forced by the sun; and Mr. Colewich had a
dish of new potatoes on Christmas Day ! A county Sentinel is
cocksure that he has heard the blackbird in full song; and in the
grounds of Mr. White there is a finch's nest with three eggs, which
he will be happy to show to all the curious in ornithology. In short,
the marriage of January and May is no longer a fiction.
Now it is a singular fact that none of our Natural Philosophers,
Astronomers, Astrologers, Meteorologists, Murphies, or Clerks of
the Weather, have foretold, or satisfactorily accounted, for such a
signal deviation from the usual march of the seasons. They have
been looking for it, in electric currents, in the winds, in the moon,
in the planetary conjunctions, in a reel of the earth from her old
axis, but neither they, nor even our Political Weathercocks, have
pointed to the very striking coincidence, that since the transporta-
tion of Frost, we have had no hard winter. -

MR. AldeRMAN Gibbs begs to inform the parishioners of St. Stephen's,
Walbrook, and the public in general, that he has just published a work of
a very curious and novel description, entitled, “The Accounts of THE
Churchwarden of St. STEPHEN's, WALBRook.” A work of this descrip-
tion not having been published for very many years, it is hoped that the
public, and especially the parishioners of St. Stephen's, Walbrook, will
duly appreciate it. It is illustrated by an immense number of figures, and
is altogether very cleverly got up.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Oſije Śtate Crialg in Hºteland.
We always thought that the ordinary police van was the proper
vehicle for bringing up accused parties to the Court where they are
to take their trial. O'Connell, however, was fortunate enough to get
the Lord Mayor of Dublin's state coach, with all the usual properties,
including the mace, which was understood to have been relacquered,
lest it should have been eclipsed by the more abundant brass of the
chief traverser. If state coaches are to be used for the purpose of
bringing alleged delinquents to trial, we should recommend the
London Corporation to let out the carriage of the Mayor to such
defendants as may be wealthy enough to pay for the accommodation.
We understand the Lord Mayor of Dublin has issued, or intends
issuing, the following—
C A R D.
The Lord Mayor of Dublin, ever anxious to meet the wishes of the
accused and persecuted portion of the public, begs leave to offer the
use of the state coach on terms exceedingly moderate. Prisoners
taken up at their own homes, and surrendered into the custody of
the Court on very reasonable charges. Every defendant is allowed
to carry one of his bail as luggage on the coach box, and witnesses
in footmen's liveries accommodated on the step behind, at a very low
scale of prices. Prisoners in the habit of being tried repeatedly may
contract for the use of the coach by the job, month or year, and
convicted culprits called for at the House of Correction on the expir-
ation of their sentence. No fees to coachmen. Parties of four, if
included in the same indictment, taken at a very reduced rate, and
acquittals punctually attended to. No extra charge for taking the
mace; but if the Lord Mayor attends personally in his gold chain, it
is expected that the value of the chain will be deposited at his Lord-
ship's house previous to starting.

Pray explain.
MR. Rigby.
If John and Rigby were my only names,
Then I should be John Rigby plain enough ;
But having been accustomed from my youth

Another name, that is not John or Rigby,
I do submit John Rigby is not I.

In mercy, sir, unravel straight this yarn
Which you have spun but to entangle us
In such a web of mystery and doubt,
That we can scarcely see our way at all.—
Are you John Rigby, sir, or are you not?
MR. Rigby.
If being John, and being also Rigby,
Makes me John Rigby, then, I own, I’m he ;
But if, by being more, I’m rendered less,
Then am I not John Rigby.
CHIEF JUSTICE.
Pray explain.
MR, Rigby.
My parents, or my godfathers, or both,
Or it might be, my godfathers alone,
For they have often in such things a voice,—
Gave me the name of John.

Zounds, Mister Rigby,
If you were christened John, you are John Rigby.
MR. Rigby.
Nay, hear me out, my Lord. They called me John
But more than that, they called me Jason, too.
And so, John Jason Rigby is my name.

Is it for this you have detained the Court,
Consumed the public time, delayed the trial,
And put my patience to a fearful test

THE GIBBS’ TESTIMONIAL.
We understand it is in contemplation to present to Alderman Gibbs
a testimonial, in commemoration of his having at length made up his
accounts. It is to consist of a long column with Egyptian hieroglyphics
running from the top to the bottom, and terminating at the top in a
finely chiselled figure of St. Stephen presenting the Alderman with a draft
for eighteen hundred pounds, while Mercury is tearing out, from the
bosom of Time, some unintelligible papers marked “vouchers.” On
the top is a weathercock, the four points of the compass being marked
by the figures of four auditors, while the alderman himself acts as the nave in
the centre, round which the auditors are revolving.
Triumph of the British Constitution.
An unfortunate calf destined for sausage-meat, having been found on a
butcher's premises, in a condition said to be unfit for human food, was
sent for into the police-office yard, that the magistrate himself might
judge of it. . This glorious privilege awarded to the calf, of being tried
by one of his own peers, is quite in conformity with the splendid provi-
sions of our unparalleled Constitution 1
“LADY L.'s JOURNAL OF A VISIT TO FOREIGN
COURTS.”
As this soul-stirring publication is about to be continued, and as it
has formed the subject of conversation in the very highest circles, we
hasten to lay before the public a letter on the subject from a most
distinguished leader of ton :-
LETTER FROM LADY JUDY PUNCH TO HER GRACE. The Duchess of
Jr. nkins.
What malheur afflige my dear Duchess I looked for you in vain
last night at Lady Smithfield's. I sent Lord P. to all your accustomed
sºjours of evenings—
L'HôTEL DE L'Aigle,
Route de la Cité; la Maison de la Conduite Blanche; le Château de
Jean de la Paille, à Hampstead—in vain—your Grace was absent.
The nobles of the land were without their brightest ornament; and
the dear Duke of Jenkins (who joined us afterwards) was seen at his
club taking his ordinary rafraichissement of moitié et moitié alone. Can
it be that the blanchissage (as stated) required your presence elsewhere?
One of your dear children told me you had sold your mécanique à
repasser. Well, cara mia, as soon as that bisogna is completed, come to
the faithful arms of your Giuditta. Lord P. shall be your cataliere.
With what joy does he ever receive news of the dear Duke and
your Grace
My love, I have cent mille choses à vous dire—a hundred thousand,
positively. I wish to consult you about the streetest pink bonnet, aur
carottes; about such a tocque, en relours épinglé aux clour de Brurelies 1
Above all, to talk to you about Lady L.'s Journal. My love, the
whole town is positively mad about it. I give you my parole d’honneur
quite folle. ... If you could have heard Lady Barbican last night, quite
créré-ing with envy at the Marchioness's success—if you could have
witnessed the enthusiasm of Percy Aldersgate (Lord Smithfield's
son, you know)--and poor dear Lord Billingsgate's raptures of joy
“Her Ladyship,” said he, turning round to little Frank Ludgate (of
the Farril.gdon family), who was at cards with the three odious
Aldermanbury girls, “has done honour to her country and her class!
We thank her — the noblesse of England thank her. She has
enabled us to show the vile roturiers, and low newspaper-creatures,
that the aristocracy of England is superior to them with the pen, as
in every other way. She has shown that we are of a different
order of beings—a superior one—and, in so doing, has only performed
the duty of a British Peeress—the duty of us all. We must stand
by our order, my Lords and Ladies. I, for my part, never move
without having my rank, my order, I proudly say my caste, in “my
eye.” 29
“I wonder he mentioned it,” said downright old Lady Friarbridge;
at which bluff Lord St. Paul's nodded his head waggishly. In a
word, my dear, it was voted that the Journal should be read instantly
for the benefit of the company assembled; and, as 'tis known that
your darling husband the Duke can spell the longest words without
hesitating, he was unanimously selected to fill the office of lecteur.
Arabella Minory gracefully brought and snuffed the chandelle de
nowton for the dear Duke, who, refreshing himself with a sip of a
delicious sorbet au genièrre, began as follows:–
. “Saturday, August 22, 1840.-Among the various vexations of life (I mean not to
include the real ills, but to speak of the numberless trifles that irritate and annoy one),

few things are more disagreeable than the appearance of one’s maid by one's bed-side at
four o'clock in the morning, with a candle in her hand.”
“Admirably said, dear Lady Billingsgate,” exclaimed your darling
husband. “How pretty that way of saying “annoying one with one's
maid by one's bed-side’—one only finds people of fashion ever use]
one's language in the proper way—does one " “I call it the unique
way,” said the Dowager of Aldgate, to her daughter Blanche Pump-
ington. “I think it must be more annoying for one's maid though,
than for one's self, for you know one's maid must be up at three,”
said stupid old Friarbridge—but her remark was told low, and the
old frump, you know, is of city extraction.
His Grace continued to read :—
“The town was in a great bustle, this being the Fête of Reubens. This ceremony onl
occurs once in a hundred years, and this is but the second time it has been celebrated.
Ruben’s Descent from the Cross is a magnificent picture, and the rays of the sun falling
on it, showed it to great advantage. * * * The Crucifixion, at the Musée, also by
Rubens, claims the traveller's attention; but we, unfortunately, had not the time to
examine the pictures, or to go to the Church of Saint Jacques. We paid a visit to Mr.
Baillie, the great shawl merchant, and bought some of the wondrous black silk.” “ ”
“I thought they had no time,” said odious Friarbridge.
“To see pictures, no,” said the Duke indignantly, “but to buy
black silk is a very different thing—(Cries of hear !)—though, why
should we say that her Ladyship had no time for pictures, when the
sentence above, shows such a profound knowledge of them : Does
she not call the painter Rubens, Ruben, and Reubens in that single
page Does she not tell us that his Féte occurs once in a hundred
years, and that the sun's beams falling on a picture, enable you to
see it to the greatest advantage Who could have told those things|
but a true connoisseur !”
A little dispute between two noble Dukes present, here arose as to
whether the word, as applied to a lady, should be connoyshure or con-
noyshuse, which was decided by Sir James Grunt stating that the
first was the correct word; and as the Chevalier is fresh from Paris,
his opinion of course was taken.
The Duke resumed :—
“We then drove to the railway, where we found a scene of unequalled confusion. We
had great difficulty in getting places, and only succeeded after a scuffle between Lord L.
and some pert priest.”
Gracious Heavens ! how pale the Duke of Jenkins becomes at
reading this: “A scuffle between Lord L. and a priest —it's too bad!”.
* What’s too bad tº said St. Paul’s.
“The scuffle between the noble Lord and the priest.” -
“On whose side " said St. Paul's. “Do you mean that it is
wrong of a Lord to scuffle with a clergyman, or of a clergyman to
scuffle with a Lord t” -
“He ought to have given way.” -
“Who ought to have given way t” continued the persevering old
nobleman. But he had evidently his cross look on that day; and,
without deigning to answer his question, the Duke continued to read:
“The railway travelling has the undoubted º: of enabling one to move from
place to place with great rapidity. (BRAvo.) But its drawbacks are innumerable. The |
noise. the smell, the jar, and, above all, the being brought into contact with all sorts
and ronditions of people.” |
Lord St. Paul's-“My dear Duke, I think, for my part, that this is
rather a dangerous sort of writing now-a-days. I don't think that
ladies, of however exalted rank, are quite justified in shuddering at
being brought into contact with their fellow-creatures.”
The Duke.—“Fellow-creatures | No, no. For Heaven's sake mode-
rate your expressions ! My Lord, this is dangerous levelling doctrine.”
Lord St. Paul's.-"Lady L.'s bett ERs have condescended to mix
with all sorts and conditions of people.”
The Duke.—“Who are her ladyship's betters ?”
Lord St. Paul's.-" Sir, we won't talk religion in company. Pray
go on.”
“A picturesque-looking man, whose appearance was that of a half Spaniah brigand,
half player”—(a half Spanish brigand is a subtle distinction, suggested some one)-
“also accompanied us. We dined at Liège, and posted on to Aix-la-Chapelle, where we
arrived late, having passed the Prussian frontier, where the Custom House officers were
civil, and did not unpack or meddle with anything we had, except a ham, on which they
enforced duty. The railroad is to be continued to Cologne, which will much facilitate
travelling. w. remained but one night at Aix, which is full of people. I took a bath,
but cannot say I liked the experiment.”
The Duke.—“It is an experiment I have never tried.”—(A laugh.)
After which he continues:—
“We were next day picked up by the steamer, which brought the rest of our family
from Rotterdam. These boats are {.. narrow, and adapted to carry a great number of
passengers. There were two hundred on this occasion ; but as we occupied the pavilion,
which is really a good-sized private room, we, were well accommodated, and enjoyed
plenty of air and light, and were not molested by strangers.”
St. Paul's.—“What a pleasant frame of mind to travel in. If
people do not wish to be molested by strangers, why do they not stay
at home Go on, my dear Duke of Jenkins.”
“We passed Bonn, and the Drachenfels, both of which disappointed us, and, at four,
arrived at Coblentz, which is very finely situated. A picturesque bridge of boats connects
it with the citadel of Ehrenbretstein, bristling with its embrasures and lines of artillery.
- . Next morning, September 4, we continued our progress. The scenery after
Coblentz becomes much more grand. We passed some old castles and many picturesque
crags and hills, feathered down to the water's edge with luxuriant foliage. The prettiest
seemed to me in possession of Prince Frederick of Prussia. This castle has been repaired
and rendered habitable, and must be in summer a delightful residence. It is situated
halfway up a rocky hill, and perched like an eagle's nest in a romantic situation.”
Lady Friarbridge.—“Are eagles' nests always in romantic situations!”
The Duke.—“Madam, her Ladyship knows best.”
Lord St. Paul's.-‘‘Perhaps you are not aware that, hearing of the
noble travellers' disappointment at Drachenfels, the king of Prussia
had the mountain pulled down. And, Duke, what a charming expres-
sion that is, “bristling with embrasures;’ it is as if we were to say,
indented with pikes.”
The Duke.—“As you say—it is only the very highest nobility that
can think of such expressions. By the way, I may take your word
for that little anecdote about the king of Prussia ( I will insert it in
a proper quarter, heading it ‘Polit Eness to a Baitish Noblk MAN'
—eh —but to proceed :—
* * * “We drove through the fine free town of Frankfort • * it is finely situated on
the Maine; it is built of white stone, has wide streets, and good hotels " " " At Wurz-
burg, we spent the night at an Hôtel, mark the delicacy of that lady's-an hotel with
the circumflex :) which we found dear, dirty, and the eating beyond all description bad.
Having discovered that the waiter and the master of theinn understood French, I derived
considerable comfort from informing them that we had meant to stay the next day; but,
finding everything so bad, we should go on ***The distance from Wurzburg to Nurem:
berg may be accomplished in about twelve hours; but we determined to divide this, and
sleep at Langenfeldt, a small, dirty inn, where, nineteen years ago, returning from
Vienna, we bought and carried off all their china, of which they neither knew the beauty
nor the value, but which turned out to be the finest old Dresden, and once the property
of the Margraves of Anspach. The landlord remembered us all.”
Lord St. Paul's.-* And no wonder he did.”
Lord Billingsgate.—“Egad, it was a devilish good
trick that—carrying off all the old fellow's china "
Lord St. Paul's.-* Of which he did not know the
value, and for which of course the noble English
party paid the utmost farthing. You would not
suppose that they would hoax the poor fellow as
to the value of his wares 1"
Lord Billingsgate.—“I don't call it hoaring at all.”
(cries of no no 1)—“it’s fair play, I say—it's only
coming Yorkshire over them,-eh, Jenkins 1"
Lord St. Paul's.-‘That is a sweet sentence re-
garding the Hôtel at Wurzburg—‘I, derived con-
siderable comfort” from abusing the landlord—
or rather dis-abusing him 1 What a graceful and
good-tempered guest the Wurzburger must have
had Î"
Lady Friarbridge.—“But why, if her ladyship is
so angry at dirty inns, did she stop at the other
“dirty inn” at What-do-ye-call-it?—Langenfeldt "
Lord St. Paul's.-"My dear Lady Friarbridge–
you have lived all your life in the City or on the
Šurrey side—I can get a peep sometimes into gen-
teeler neighbourhoods; and let me whisper in your ear, that there was
perhaps some more china to be had at Langenfeldt. Her Ladyship talks

the language so well, as to give us a few specimens of her proficiency

affecting circumstance) put an abrupt finale to our soirée. We asked
Lord Billingsgate to lead our dear Duke home ; but his Lordship
said he must be off, as he had other fish to fry; Lord St. Paul's left
us, inviting us all to his ball; and your darling husband was left to
go hoine by himself. It was one o'clock; one's maid had been in
waiting with oue's pattens, I don’t know how long; and when one
got home, one was quite glad to get to one's bed and dream of one

TAKING A HINT.
ousin Punch,--I write to thank you for the
“Hint” you gave in your Almanack • “to
Country Cousins” for buying birds in Regent-
street with old clothes, &c. I have now a
most excellent aviary. Every coat, shoe, stock-
ing, handkerchief, shirt, book, or old thing that
was useless, I have long since exchanged for
ornithological specimens.
Out º gratitude, I send you the list cf my
warbling collection :-
A pair of Wellington boots, that I have
taught to draw water like anything.
A German pipe, that whistles beautifully.
A pair of silk stockings under a course of sulphur.
A satin waistcoat that is very fond of sugar.
Burns's Poems, and a lancet-case, both in full song, and
Half a dozen pair of Russia ducks, that at present are moulting.
I hope in time to add to my collection a pair of corduroys I am now
wearing ; and a shooting-coat which is nearly out of the elbows.
Yours, most gratefully, Punch,
A Country Cousin.
If I send you a great coat, which is in beautiful feather, would it be

THE CLOCK OF ST. CLEMENT'S.
We have received several complaints on the subject of the Clock of St.
Clements, which has caused the greatest inconvenience since it has been
put right, by the confusion it occasions to those who, having been accustomed
to see it always wrong, are now more than ever misled by it. Like the
boy who cried “wolf” so long. that at last no one believed him when the
wolf really came, the clock of St. Clements has been so long at variance
with the truth, that no one, now that it is actually right, attaches the
amallest credit to it.
The ceremony of setting the clock going, was an extremely solemn one,
and caused the greatest excitement among the bystanders. The pave-
• No. 129.
ment opposite the railings of the church was occupied by a select party of
juveniles, and the kerbstone of the Straud, commanding a view of the
clock, was appropriated to a few friends of the watchmaker. The beadle's
party had secured a private lamp-post to view the proceedings, and the
general company stood in groups on the open space opposite the western"
door-way.
Everything being in readiness for the clock to be set right, the church-
warden summoned the pendulum, in the Queen's name, to resume its
functions, and the company outside having given three cheers for the
main-spring, the groups began gradually to disperse, expressing them-
selves highly delighted with the very novel sight afforded them.
THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
(From the Observer's own Correspondent).
EEping to the truth, or what we thought to be
the truth, we last week intimated—but we
never pledge ourselves, for when we are
pledged we are frequently taken in—that
Webster had had no comedies worth any-
thing sent in, and that if he had, it was not
likely that, looking at the state of the stage,
he would think so. We have had a letter
from Mr. Webster, telling us what we already
knew, for several of our friends have been
hinting as much, that we are quite wrong,
which we delight in being told when we are,
which is almost always. We only speak as
we think, or at least we try to do so; and if
we do not, we can only say we do our best,
which is often worse for ourselves—at least
we continually find it so.
Everybody, that is to say, everybody we
meet, at least all who speak to us, which is
not exactly everybody, is talking about Strick-
land’s “Falstaff,” that is to say, if “Falstaff.”
(which so many actors have filled, though nobody ever did fill it
except Stephen Kemble, who played it without stuffing—not but
what he had a good deal of what the actors term stuff about
him)—can be called Strickland's.
Some prefer him, we mean of course, Stephen Kemble, though
we might be thought to mean Strickland—in the part, for the latter
is a very fine actor, and always knows what he is about, excepting of
course when he is carried away by excitement, and then he never
goes too far-or if he does, he comes back again,_at least we
always thought so, that is to say, whenever we thought upon the sub-
ject at all—which is very seldom. Nevertheless, our own opinion is,
that Strickland is not so dignified as John Kemble, but that does not
prevent us from comparing him with Stephen, who would not have
competed with his brother, that is to say his own brother, for we do
not of course allude to Strickland's brother, nor do we know if he
has a brother, and if he has, he is certainly not upon the stage, at
least in London; at all events, if he is, we do not know of it; and if
we did, we do not see why we should be called upon—not that we
mean to say any one has called upon us—to notice it. Some people
think Bannister beat Stephen Kemble; but that makes no difference;
and though some have preferred Suett, we never liked Suett, at
least as an actor, though at the dinner-table—we don't mean in beef
—Suett was always acceptable.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THR ELEVENTH.-Of The CLERGY.
Alſº-N. He people are divided into the clergy
ºrn
- º and the laity—the former of whom will
\º be the subject of this chapter ; and a
very lively chapter may be expected in
consequence.
The clergy have several privileges,
some of which were taken from them
at the Reformation, in consequence of
their having become impudent from the
great liberties allowed to them. Many
of the personal exemptions still continue.
For instance, no one can be compelled
to sit upon a jury, after he has taken
orders—though, semble that the persons at the free-list office in the
theatres, notwithstanding their having taken orders, are liable to serve
as jurymen. A clergyman cannot be chosen to any temporal office,
such as bailiff or constable—so that a curate cannot be a bailiff at a
lock-up house—nor could a rector act as a policeman in a street riot.
A clergyman is also privileged from arrest, in going to, and returning
from the performance of duty, or, as the Norman Jurist expresses it,
“il ne faut pas commettre un tel faux pas de nabber il parsone, et lui
porter hors de la pulpite jusqu'a maison de fermer au cle.” (One
must not commit such a false step, as to nab the parson, and carry him
out of the pulpit to the lock-up house). Formerly, a clergyman had what
is called the benefit of clergy in cases of felony—a privilege, which if a
layman had asked for, he would have been told, that the authorities
would “see him hanged first.” The last remnant of benefit of clergy,
was the benefit allowed every May-day to the sweeps—who were vulgarly
called the clergy, but this has been almost swept away by the Ramoneur
—a very upright invention, which, disdaining to force itself into holes and
corners, leaves the soot to ignite in the crevices of the chimneys.
The clergymen have, however, several disabilities; for instance, they
cannot sit in Parliament, but “that's not so much,” as Othello–(one of
Nature's clergymen) very properly observed—for there are many occa-
sions, such as a financial discussion, when exclusion from the House of
Commons must be regarded as a privilege, rather than a disability.
Formerly, a clergyman was not allowed to trade, but was restricted to
the cure of souls. It does not seem, however, that even in the days of
doubtful orthography—for our ancestors never could spell—a parson
might have occupied himself in the drying of fish, which is certainly in
one sense undertaking the cure of soles—for we do not find that Shake-
speare's beautiful line in Hamlet, “Excellent well, you're a fishmonger.”
was ever applied to any reverend contemporary of the Swan of Avon.
It having been determined that a contract with any company, of which
any spiritual persons were partners or members, was void, and this
having been decided to be the law, another law was passed in the reign of
her present Majesty to decide that it was not, or, if it was, it never ought
to be.
America; for as there are, no doubt, spiritual persons among them, they
may as well shuffle out of their liabilities, by reference to the fine old
principles of English law, and thus give a sacred character to one of the
sublimest swindles ever attempted in any age or country. By the new
act, parsons may trade in joint-stock companies, their evaneseence giving
them, no doubt, a sort of ethereal character. The clergy may also trade
in books, or in anything connected with keeping a school, which admits of
their adding to their income by selling ink and various other scholastic
commodities.
We shall now consider the various ranks and degrees of the clergy, com-
mencing with an archbishop, who is the greatest gun in the Church, according
to all the canons. Archbishops were formerly elected by all the people;
but the tumultuous scenes that arose were a great scandal; and indeed we
cannot fancy his Grace of Canterbury placarding the town with posters,
calling upon the public to “vote for Howley,” or defacing the walls of the
episcopal palace with the words, “Howley for Canterbury.”
Archbishoprics afterwards came to be conferred by the sovereigns till
Gregory VII. exhibited a bull, declaring that princes should not meddle
in the manufacture of prelates. Henry VIII., however, put an end to
the Pope's pretensions, by giving the power of electing an archbishop or
a bishop to the bishops themselves; that is to say, when his Majesty
has made his own choice, he gives the prelates the power of confirming
to it—or, in other words, rams a bishop down their throats, thus forcing
them to swallow him.
An archbishop is a sort of inspector of all the bishops in his province ;
but he does not call them out like an inspector would so many policemen,
to examine their mitres, and see that their lawn sleeves are properly
starched, before going on duty in their respective dioceses. An arch-
bishop may call out the bishops, just as a militia colonel may call out the mi-
litia; and it is his duty to look after the spiritualities of a vacant see, while
the Crown takes care of the temporalities, which are the only remunerating
part of the business. If a bishop does not fill up a vacant living in his
It might be a hint worthy of adoption by the repudiating States of
diocese within six months, the archbishop may ; but the bishop has gene.
rally too much archness to give a chance to his superior.
The archbishop also takes the first presentation to a living which may
occur in a bishop's diocese, so that a bishop's mouth waters a good deal
before he is suffered to quaff the sweets of patronage. The Archbishop of
Canterbury has also the privilege of putting the crown on the heads of the
Kings and Queens of England; but this seems to be more a hatter's
business, and we, therefore, do not enter into it.
Bishops have authority over the manners of the people; and we wonder,
therefore, that the Bishop of London does not favour us with a book on
etiquette.
Several alterations have been made, and others contemplated, by the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners appointed by Act of Parliament in the reign
of William IV., to unite certain sees, by cutting through the barrier or
isthmus that divided them.
We now come to deans and chapters, which would form a chapter of
themselves, only there is no occasion for it. A dean and chapter are a
sort of council to advise the bishop, who, however, seldom asks their
advice; or, if he asks it, scarcely ever takes it. A dean formerly super-
intended ten canons, but this must have been in the days when the Church
was disposed to be militant. The bishop is the superior of the dean and
chapter, with the power of visiting them and “correcting their excesses;”
which surely cannot mean, administering soda-water, after they have
been rather convivial :
An archdeacon comes the next to a bishop, and visits the clergy—
leaving his card formally with some, and dropping in to tea, in a friendly
manner, no doubt, with others.
Rural deans, in these anti-rural days, are nearly out of use. They had
nothing to do but pry into the domestic affairs of the parochial clergy.
They were called rural, very likely, from their love of country occupations,
such as fishing for preferment, and making hay during sunshine.
We now come to the parson, a name derived from the word persona,
—a person ; because the parson is a person; that is to say, he is in the
parish decidedly “somebody.” He is sometimes called the rector or
ruler, but why, we cannot tell; for there is no rule to account for it.
Formerly, the monasteries appropriated to themselves the valuable part
of a living, and contracted with some curate to do the work; the monas-
teries acting then, much as the “sweaters” do now, making a very good
profit upon a task which they gave a beggarly sum to another party to
execute. Henry VIII., however, determined to sweat the monastic
sweaters; for, at the dissolution of monasteries, he swept away the insti-
tutions, and pocketed the good things that belonged to them. The Crown
having afterwards granted these things out to laymen, gave rise to what
are called lay-appropriations, hands having been laid upon them by those
who were most inappropriately possessed of them.
These appropriators used to get the duty done very cheap by a vicar :
and there being much competition among the clergy, vicar's work, was
done on such very low terms, that there was an alarming sacrifice of the
interests of the parishioners. This led to an act being passed to protect

|-
vicars, by providing for their being better paid, and some of the smaller
tithes were settled on the vicar; who, on the principle of “little fishes
being sweet,” no doubt eagerly clutched at them.
The duties incumbent on a parson, are first to act as the incumbent,
by living in the place where he has his living. By a recent Act, a
parson absenting himself from his parsonage for upwards of three
months in a year, forfeits a third of the value of his benefice, and so in
proportion ; so that if he stays away a whole year, he will have more to
y than to receive, and thus realise the homely picture of the man who
is said to have won a shilling and lost eighteen-pence.
There is only one way of becoming a parson or vicar, but five at least
of ceasing to continue so :—lst. By dying, or going quite out, like an
exhausted rushlight. 2nd. By taking another and a better benefice, or,
following the allegory of the light, being removed from a japan to a
plated candlestick. 3rd. By being made a bishop, or undergoing a sort
of conversion from simple tallow to superior sperm. 4th. By resignation,
or, still pursuing the simile of the light, suddenly going out, nobody knows
why. And 5th. By deprivation, that is to say, being deprived of one's
benefice altogether, and expelled from the clerical profession, which is
like a gas lamp completely cut off from the company's main.
A curate is the lowest grade in the church, for he is a sort of journey-
man parson, and several of them meet at a house of call in St. Paul's
Church Yard—ready to job a pulpit by the day—and being in fact
“clergymen taken in to bait” by the landlord of the house alluded to.
From the clergy, we come next to the churchwardens, who keep the
church, and represent the parish. They also keep the accounts; and, in
some cases, like that of Aldernian Gibbs, these accounts are so literally
kept, that it is hard to get hold of them. The churchwarden may keep
order in the church ; and if a boy giggles, it is the duty of the church-
warden to frown, or even to kick the juvenile's shins, if he should be near
enough.
†† clerks and sextons are also particularly regarded by the common
law—which must be very common to regard such exceedingly common
people. The parish clerk was formerly often in holy orders, but any one
may be a parish clerk, excepting, by-the-bye, Macbeth, who was utterly
disqualified for the post, inasmuch as he could not say “Amen, according
to the authority of Shakspeare.

last, in consequence of the marriage of a
gentleman in a blue coat and a lady in a
white sarsnet bonnet. The names of the
parties were not known ; but public curio-
sity was excited by a cortège waiting at the
door, consisting of a post-chaise and two,
a fly and one, with a man on the box wear-
ing a livery hat but a private coat, and a
cab, the driver of which had endeavoured to
conceal his badge by tucking it up under
his waistcoat. A few idlers having been
attracted to the spot, waited outside the
railings of the church; but, as the cere-
mony was protracted far beyond the usual
time—perhaps there was some dispute about
the fees—the crowd kept increasing until
there was a mob of several hundreds.
The moment “the happy couple” made
their appearance, they were received with
partial cheering and universal laughter, which they acknowledged by
jumping briskly into the post-chaise, and trying to pull up the blinds,
amid the increased merriment of the multitude. As the friends hurried
into the single horse fly and the street cab, the same compliments were
paid to them ; and the last of the wedding guests, who, for want of room,
was compelled to mount the box with the cabman, was received with
ironical cheering, which lasted while the nosebag was being removed
from the head of the horse, an operation that occupied several minutes,
The nuptial party having been hooted down Parliament-street, at length
succeeded in getting into full gallop, and thus eluded any further
compliment.

TO THE ANTI-LEAGUE AND THE ANTI-CORN-LAW
LEAGUE.
UNch, in his anxiety for the protection of British
Agriculture, will be happy to supply the Anti-
League and the Anti-Corn-Law League with
articles, of which the following is a specimen.
To save trouble and expense, it is proposed,
that instead of being stitched into the Maga-
zines, according to the general practice, the
articles should be taken direct from the print-
ing office to the butter shops. There is no
reason why there should be any middle class
between the authors and the waste paper dealers,
for it is better that the writings should attain
their end with as little delay as possible. Punch
will supply the following by the ream, quire, or
sheet, to any amount that may be wished for.
PROTECTION TO INDUSTRY.
The British Lion is at length roused, and has shaken his mane,
while the British Bull-dog wags his home-grown tail with responsive
sympathy. The farmer who has long been trembling in his homely
but health-preserving high-lows, has at length buckled on his
armour for the fight; and, with the plough in one hand and the
English Constitution in the other, he may defy all the efforts of the
League to do him an injury. When we think of our hearths and
our homesteads, our blood rushes to our cheeks; and our first inquiry,
upon turning our situation over in our minds, is, how would our
apathy make our present circumstances appear to our forefathers 1
Now is the time to make a bold effort in defence of our ploughs, our
rakes, our pitchforks, and every other effect that is dearest to our
hearts, and nearest to our bosoms.
But now, to take another view of the question, and to regard it
merely as a matter of political economy:-Let us ask, how the native
growers, with sixteen millions of quarters of wheat, can be in the
same situation as a mill-owner with forty thousand bales of cotton
Supposing the markets to admit of it—which we altogether deny,
yet allowing it for the sake of argument—how could scarcity be
compatible with a currency fluctuating between two and two-and-a
half, with stocks down and prices up, markets full and pockets
empty, a large floating surplus depressing the money power, and a
sort of feverish rampancy quickening the pulsation of fiscal enter-
prise This we admit to be a frightful, but it is not an overdrawn
picture. Ricardo, who was the first to declare the startling fact, that
prices must fall directly value came to be lowered, has already pre-
pared the students in political economy for the consequences we have
hinted at. While the bank coffers are literally groaning with bullion,
and corn is almost sprouting in the warehouses, as if impatient of the
bond to which the short-sighted policy of Mark-lane has subjected
it, while Consols are quoted at what they are, and the Bank par-
lour is obstinately bent on doing nothing, it is time for the farmers
to stir themselves.
We hail the present movement with the deepest satisfaction ;
and we again encourage the British Lion to shake his mane
“till each particular hair shall stand on end, like quills upon the
fretful porcupine.” But let us not be misunderstood. We do not
mention the British Lion with the view of disparaging the British
Bull-dog. Let him, too, wag that tail which, if well directed, never
wags in vain ; and let our standard be the harrow, our shield the
barn-door, our sword the scythe, and our text-book, Magna Charta.

Post.—PUNch.

** PHILANTHROPY’” IN THE BAIL CourT.
ALMost fainting with intense delight, we extract the subjoined
paragraph from the Times:—
“BAil, Court.-In the Matten or — —Mr. Atherton moved that an attorney
might, at his own request, be struck off the roll, in order that he might be more entirely
at liberty to pursue ‘philanthropical occupations.”
“The application was granted.”
A cannibal who has forsworn man's flesh, and, moved only by his
own stomach, contents himself with milk diet; a shark that turns
from “a man overboard,” meekly swallowing seaweed, and not BEN
BINNAcLE ; a porcupine suddenly softened into a beaver; a web-
spinning, fly-catching spider changed into a honey-bee ; Lord
Bhough AM turned to a monosyllabic Quaker, and never turning
again ;-any one of these transformations might call from Punch a
passing paragraph of wonderment. But that an attorney—(no, we
must have a new line for the miracle):—
But that an attorney should dash legal ink (alchemic fluid () from
his lips—tear sheepskin from his bosom—and, untangling red tape
from his heart-strings, become, in the face of all the inns of court,

another change We know no parallel in human experience. True
it is, that Peachem talks of one of his gang, who resolves to forego
picking pockets and return to tailoring, which “he calls an honest
employment:” but this is fiction. Now, “—,” of the Bail Court,
is stranger than The Beggar's Opera !
Is the man—benevolent apostate —safe Will he not be way-
laid and maltreated by attorneys still in the ink? Will not Chancery-
lane compass his ruin Can he defy Clifford's Inn Are there no
perils in Cursitor-street No pounce-box bravoes lying perch in
Gray’s-inn-square We know, among the Mahometans, the relent-
less cruelty with which they follow a backslider from their faith.
Now, whatever satirists may insinuate, attorneys are but men; and
can they forgive this large, this most eccentric insult offered by
“—” to their whole body ? Can English solicitors be thought
more merciful than Turks We fear not. Hence our anxiety.

good look at the countenance of “ !” Ouly one look And
wherefore ? Because that one glance would fortify us for life. Having
gazed upon the features of philanthropist, late attorney, we should
have no fear of the mal'occhio, the evil eye of the whole law-list. We

“The play's the Thing.”
THERE has been a pressure lately upon “Ham Sandwiches,” owing to
the heavy rains having had the effect of glutting the market with that
commodity. “Apples, oranges, and ginger-beer,” are still in loud demand
in the higher circles; but a “bill of the play,” unless there is something
very good in it, is not looked upon with the same greediness. “Porter”
commands an easy circulation, and the stone-bottle is never offered twice
during the entr’acte without meeting with a ready holder. Many parties
have burnt their fingers dabbling in hot potatoes, but the indentures of
butter and salt lately issued with them have given to speculators in the
gallery a fresh zest for them. The “pieman” has not been tossed so
much lately over the water, but at Covent Garden the “odd man” has
been very popular since M. Jullien opened his concerts. The National
Drama, we are sorry to say, has, since the engagement of Mr. Charles
Kean, gone down to zero.

good counsel, that I've no doubt they’ll be as quiet as mice. The
wretches wanted to rob me of half-a-crown, but I’d die first.
“However, you'll be glad to hear that I’m on the best terms with
all my neighbours. There is Monsieur Louis, the French school-

the Spanish liquorice shop, she certainly gives me some anxiety, but
they say her mother is going to manage the business for her.
“You will see—for the tradesmen will lay their bills before you—
that my housekeeping is regulated by the strictest economy—a leg
of mutton hot one day, cold with pickles the next. Nevertheless, if
you think it would be better for me to retrench pickles, why onions
shan't stand between me and my constitution.”
And so the young woman goes on—and so the “house is opened.”
And where is Bob SLIMELY Now at the plate-chest, and at the
bureau, and now into his friend's, eating tariff beef in the larder.

THE WESUVIUS AND ETNA ExTINCTION COMPANY.
TD EAR the city of Naples is situate the
volcano, or burning mountain, of We-
suvius; and, in the romantic Island of
Sicily, that of Etna. These volcanoes
have, from time immemorial, consti-
tuted a great nuisancetotheir respective
neighbourhoods. Most persons must
be aware, that in the latter part of the
first century, an eruption of Vesuvius
engulfed the large and populous towns
of Herculaneum and Pompeii in lava;
and proved fatal to that eminent natu-
ralist, Pliny. Etna, in 1669, as the
celebrated geographer, Guthrie, in-
forms us, destroyed fourteen towns
and villages. Minor eruptions of both
these volcanoes have since been, and
are still, continually occurring; at one time, overwhelming a village;
at another, a farm; and at all times, involving more or less damage to
person and property. It may seem wonderful that no steps should have
at any time been taken by the Neapolitans and the inhabitants of Sicily
to protect themselves and their families from such ruinous visitations;
but this circumstance is to be ascribed to the debasement of the national
mind, occasioned by the influence of superstition and priestcraft. It was
reserved for British Enterprise and Capital, availing themselves of the
resources of modern Science, to supply the desideratum, and to project a
GIGANTic UNDERTAKING,
—which, when completed, will surpass all the wonders of the world. The
object of the above-named Company is no less than the Extinction both
of Vesuvius and ETNA, to form the first in a proposed series of operations
for the Quenching of Wolcanoes.
The districts adjoining both to Etna and Vesuvius are well known to be
extremely fertile. Owing, however, to the insecurity of life and property
occasioned by the contiguity of those sources of devastation, the value of
the land is so greatly impaired, that it does not let for one-half of what it
would fetch otherwise. It is, therefore, calculated, that could the danger
attending its occupancy be removed, again of at least fifty per cent. would
accrue to the landlord, which in a few years would remunerate a very
enºrmous outlay. The Sicilian and Neapolitan landlords will be too
widely awake to their own interests not to join cordially in a speculation
which will prove so beneficial to themselves.
Vesuvius will first be operated on. It is advantageously circumstanced
for the introduction of sea-water into its crater; an object which will
be accomplished by an
ENORMOUS PUMP,
ºf the magnitude of which some idea may beformed when it is stated that
it will be worked by what may truly be denominated a
MONSTER stEAM - ENGINE,
the piston of which will exceed in height and dimensions
THE DUKE OF YORK's COLUMN.
Pipes, communicating with this pump, will be laid down along the coast
to the foot of the mountain; extending up the side of it into the crater.
By this contrivance
ocean will be pumped up,
(without the slightest hyperbole or exaggeration of expression)
FROM THE BAY OF NAPLES:
Thus bringing to bear upon the burning bowels of the mountain
THE cold water cuRE,
which has long been recognised as the remedy most effectual in cases of
combustion.
Arrangements will be entered into with the Neapolitan Government and
Proprietors, for the purpose of securing an adequate remuneration to the
Company, which, at the lowest computation, would amount to the in-
terest of
THREE MILLIONS STERLING ANNUALLY.
But this is the least promising part of the speculation.
doubt that beneath Vesuvius lie
Mines of Exhaustless wealth,
which could be explored as soon as they were cool enough, independently
of the labours of excavation. At all events, the quantity of sulphur
which would be found, would be infinite; and as where there is fire there
must necessarily be fuel, and since Vesuvius has often been known to
throw up cinders, it is by no means unreasonable to expect, that with its
other mineral treasures will be combined
No END OF COAL,
There can be no
of a quality, at any rate,
*atter superior to the Oſalarre.
To realise these advantages, it will in the first place be necessary to
purchase Mount Vesuvius on behalf of the Company. No doubt it is to
be had cheap ; , perhaps for nothing, conditionally on putting it out.
However, since funds will be required not only for this purpose, but for
the fabrication of the necessary machinery, it is requested that persons
desirous of becoming shareholders will as speedily as possible come for-
ward with their contributions. The smallest will be gladly received, and
for the present may be left at Punch's Office.

CIBBER DETECTED.
An QB peratic $$etc.).
[On the first night of Cibber's Richard III., at Drury Lane, a most
affecting incident occurred in one of the boxes. A party, not having
heard how Cibber had mangled Shakespeare's tragedy, had brought with
them Knight's illustrated edition of the original text; and the desponding
air with which they endeavoured to reconcile what they had in their hands
with what they saw on the stage, was immensely impressive. Henry VI.,
who was played by Diddear, and who does not occur at all in the proper
“Richard,” appeared a most incomprehensible mystery. The incident
struck us as of such truly lyrical character, that we at once turned it
into an operatic sketch.]
SCENE–A bor at Drury Lane.
A few bars are played tremulando, indicative of great uneasiness;
a lady and four gentlemen are discovered in a state of alarm pass-
ing from one to another a number of “ Knight's Illustrated,”

To-night on Tuesday? What is that you say :

What rapture ours can reach;
We'll gaze on each procession,
We’ll list to every speech;
And with our lives alone shall end
Our thanks to this judicious friend!
RAILWAY REFORM.
We see a Bill on this subject is to be introduced next Session to
Parliament. The provisions of the Bill, we understand, are as follows:–
1. That smoking be allowed, with the exception of the engine, which
should consume its own smoke.
2. That the Tunnels be illuminated with Vauxhall lamps.
3. That the engines be supplied with “Crevelli's Cough Lozenges” or
the “Páte Pectorale,” to cure them of the dreadful asthma they are
subject to the whole year round ; and that they be allowed to stop as
often as the stokers please to “wet their whistle.”
4. That husband and wife be not allowed to travel in the same carriage,
for fear of their falling out during the journey.
5. That the engine be placed in front of the third class train, to allow
of a large supply of coals being distributed at this cold season of the year
amongst the poorer passengers.
There are many other Clauses, which we will notice at the earliest
stage of proceedings, as soon as the Bill is brought before Parliament.
Important Statistical Intelligence.
WE understand that the Life Insurance Offices have determined not
any longer to issue Policies to habitual readers of the Morning Post.
The tables of mortality show the frightful result of subscribing regularly
to the paper mentioned. We understand that the Registrar of Births,
Deaths, and Marriages, ascribes one out of three of the deaths said to
arise from causes unknown, to the pernicious habit alluded to. The
frightful diminution of West-End Footmen and Ladies’ Maids has, it is
believed, arisen from the unfortunate persons having perused the Morning
Post; but this malady, which is in the nature of an epidemic, has lately,
we are told, been materially diminishing.

the “REAL." LION OF ENGLAND DISCOVERED. .
The identity of the English-lion has often been a matter of
dispute. Frequently have the army taken to themselves the said
lion as their especial, inalienable property; the navy—albeit, we
never knew any lion the better for a sea-voyage—have also declared
the disputed animal to be their own. We are happy to inform our
readers that a Mr. A. PIGott, orator at the Buckingham Conserva-
tive dinner, has once and for ever set the question at rest. The real
lion of England is neither military, nor nautical, but rustic :-
We so often hear of the British lion being awakened by something
or somebody, that we must needs conclude the beast to be a very
somnambulent animal. We have no doubt that the sleepy habit grew
upon him from the moment he was promoted to the royal arms. A
good Government place induces mapping upon the holder. However,
for the ten thousandth time within these few years, the British lion
is wide awake. Upon the authority of Mr. A. Pigott, the
lazy brute has at length shaken his mane, and is, doubtless, at the
present moment stretching his legs, and opening his jaws. Due
notice will be given of his growl.
The English lion has hitherto been considered carnivorous; the
more especially, when prowling at Waterloo and other shambles.
We thought, too, that he had of late been roaming in India, under
the especial protection of Lord ELLEN honough, taking a few dinners
in Sindh. No : that lion was an impostor; a flesh-eating, sanguinary
cheat. The real lion was in the county of Buckinghamshire all the
time; and, fast asleep, was digesting his bloodless meal of turnips
and oil-cake.
As the British lion is now proved to be an agricultural animal, a
creature living on herbs and pulse, we trust her Majesty will see the
justice of indicating his true nature, by ordering him, when appearing
in her royal arms, a wisp of hay in his mouth—or a few ears of barley
in his mane; or, like mad LEAR, he may be—
- * .
- - -
“Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
... With narlocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining cover.”
The legend Dieu et mon droit, must, of course, be changed. For
“God and my right” we would suggest, “Nobody but ourselves.”
. As the real British lion is now awake, and prowling in the agricul-
tural dictricts, we presume that Mr. Cobden will not again venture
there upon anything less than an elephant. Mr. CRoss has a most
Sagacious beast, and may doubtless be treated with. As the animal
has for years been in the habit of taking money from visitors, &c.,
to purchase cakes and oranges, it may also be made useful as collector
for the League. *-
By the way, talking of money, the owners of the Agricultural lion
have certainly opened their mouths. When do they open their
pockets 1 *

IMPROVEMENTS ON THE TAPIS.
The shopkeepers of Regent-street, with the laudable intention of making
their street as distingué as possible, so that it may be quoted as the street
par ercellence in the world, have determined upon flooring the pavements
with British oak, and covering them with costly carpets. The oak will
be scoured and polished by the housemaids regularly every morning, and
the carpets shaken by the policemen on their beat. A company is being
organised for this purpose, and will shortly be announced under the title
of “The BRitish OAK AND KIDDERMINSTER CARPET REGENT STREET
Pavement Cowpany,” the shares of which will be restricted to the nobility
and those persons making purchases in Regent Street. It is expected
that the wood, when covered with the carpets, will last for years.
Mr. Joseph Hume, who has lately become a member of the “Peace
Convention,” purposes this Session introducing a Bill into Parliament to
empower magistrates and vestries to employ the Troops on home-service
upon the cleansing of the streets. He has kindly sent us a sketch of a
guardsman so employed, which we subjoin with pleasure for the informa-
tion of the Army and the amusement of our readers,

THE GABMAN'S DREAM.
I Dreamt I was called from the rank where I stood,
By a party all laughing and gay; -
And I thought that the fare would be sure to be good,
For I saw they were out for the day.
And I fancied I drove them through alley and street,
Through passage, and crescent, and square ;
And I thought that my rent for the week I should meet,
Having got such a capital fare.
I dreamt that I suddenly came to a stop,
But I knew not—I guess'd not the cause,
Till I came to the earth with a terrible whop,
In obedience to gravity's laws.
Then I suddenly woke to the terrible fact,
I’d received the severest of shocks ;
For heedless, alas, of the clause in the act,
I had fallen asleep on my box |

DOCTORS BILLS.
Grrrleman, the other day, wrote a letter to the
Times, complaining of a bill which had been sent
in to him by his medical man. His grievance was,
that the items of professional service had, therein,
been generalised under the two heads of “Me-
dicine and Attendance” simply, instead of being
set forth severally and at large. He wished the
Account had been drawn up according to the
old formula, which was a specific enumera-
§ tion of the different pills, draughts, boluses, and
other matters and articles, constituting the
* value received.”
This gentleman evidently prided himself upon
his common sense, which told him that it would
* have been satisfactory to know what he had to
pay for. The same faculty, perhaps, informed him that medicine has a
marketable value, like tea or sugar; and that skill and science can be sold
by weight and measure. -
We hope the gentleman will approve of the following model of a bill,
which we draw up for the guidance of those medical men who may have
patients of his way of thinking to deal with.

THE STATE TRIALS,
(From our own Reporter.)
The Judges having taken their seats, with the exception of Mr.
Justice Burton, who was absent from ill health, the counsel for the
traversers protested against the trial being proceeded with. The
Court wished to be referred to a case. he counsel for the tra-
versers remarked that they had not had time to look one out, but
would be ready shortly. After the expiration of about an hour, the
counsel for the traversers said they had got a case, and-
The Court said they would hear it.
The Attorney-General, on the part of the prosecution, begged to
read a clause from the Statute.

The Attorney-General.-It is the Statute Book.
Mr. Fitzgibbon.—You cannot read a clause from the Act without
reading the whole of it.
The Clerk of the Court then read the whole of the Act of Parliament,
The Attorney-General would now contend
Mr. Smyly.—But stop a moment, we have only read the Act. We
have a right to hear the whole volume.
The Clerk then read the whole of the volume in which the Aet
was contained.
The Court then adjourned until the
next day.
The Attorney-General would now propose, that the Act having
been read, and the whole volume fairly before the Court, it was com-
petent for him to–
Mr. Fitzgibbon, QC.—We have had the volume read, it is trus,
but the work is in several volumes. How are the traversers to know
that the other volumes may not qualify or contradict, or in some
measure vitiate the authority of what was read yesterday !
The Court hoped that the learned Counsel would not press his
right, for it might be inconvenient.
.The Attorney-General was prepared to take any course, and have
all the volumes read, but he thought—

it did accordingly.

The Attorney-General said he thought, with all due respect to the
Council on the other side—nevertheless he did think, and always
should think—
Mr. Smyly protested against the right of the Attorney-General to
think at this state of the proceedings.
The Attorney-General said, he would be guided by the Bench, and
the Judges having left the Court to consider the point, returned and
delivered their judgments seriatim ; which were to the effect that
the Attorney-General had better not think at present.
It being now late, the Court adjourned to the

When the Attorney-General commenced his argument on the
question of proceeding while one Judge was absent; but the learned
gentleman had not nearly concluded his speech, when our express

A RARA AVIS.
An attorney applied, the other day, to have his name struck of the
rolls, in order to enable him to practise the very opposite profession of a
philanthropist. The case was so new, that the books afforded no prece-
dent to guide the judge, who observed, that “as a lawyer was never yet
known to have a turn for philanthropy, there would be some difficulty in
striking him of the roll for such a very ..º.
It is to be h that the violence of the k caused by the extreme
suddenness of the change, will not prove too much for the constitution of

inquiries was, that he was “going on as well as could be expected.”

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.—OF THE CIVIL STATE.
The Civil State includes every one of the laity who does not belong to
the military or maritime state. But there are some of the military, such
as the sentinels on duty at the Park, who are in a very civil state, when
asked a civil question.
The Civil State consists of the nobility and commonalty, the former of
which resembles, in some respeets, “ginger beer from the fountain.' the
Sovereign being the fountain from which alone it is possible to draw
ºSovereign may invent any titles he pleases; but those now in use
are Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Wiscounts, and Barons....
A Duke is derived from the latin word dur, a military leader ; and
haps the practice of soldiers wearing dux or ducks in the present day,
É. sºmething to do with it. In the time of Elizabeth, the ºrder of Dukes
became extinct—but it was galvanised fifty years afterwards. A
Marquess is the next degree of nobility, and is so called from the Teutonic
but some Barons are in the habit of degrading themselves, by wasting
their estates, without any interference of the Sovereign.
The first dignity beneath that of a Peer was a vidames, a title so old,
that antiquarians quarrel greatly as to what a vidames was ; though
they agree ty well in believing that such a thing as a rudaines never
existed. e first personal dignity after the nobility is consequently now
settled to be that of a Knight of the Garter, instituted by ward
the Third to preserve tidiness in the stockings of the aristocracy—a
point that has been beautifully kept in view by Shakespeare, who makes
Hamlet wear his stockings about his heels until he visits England,
where it is supposed he has been invested with the Garter, aud he
consequently always appears in the last act with his silk hose properly
adjusted.
Next comes a Knight Banneret, or a knight made by the Sovereign in
rson on the field of battle; so that, if a civil war should break out in
ondon, her Majesty might rush to Lincoln's Inn-fields and manufacture
. bannerets. After these come the Baronets, an order instituted
by James the First to raise money to meet a bill for the reduction of
lster. Next follow the Knights of the Bath, instituted by Henry the
Fourth, and so called from the ceremony of taking a bath the night
word marche, a limit, because the Marquesses ori-
ginally watched the limits of the kingdom—but,
whether they acted as a sort of coast-guard, or as a
lice on the frontiers, or as beadles to beat the
unds of the kingdom, we are wholly at a loss to
make up our minds about. An Earl is a title so early,
that it is impossible to trace its origin....It is sup-
£. that after the Norman Conquest, William made
rls of those who were the earliest to do him
homage. The Saxons had their Ealdormen, which
got corrupted into Earldermen—or, greater corrup-
tion still, into Aldermen. An Earl was at one time
called a Count, from an old Norman pun of the Con-
queror, who said “he could Count upon his early
friends;” but, as the pun died off, the title was dis-
continued, leaving nothing to keep it in remembrance
but the word County.
The Sovereign, in writs, always styles an earl his
“trusty and well-beloved cousin”—a reason as old
as Henry the Fourth, who had really cousined, or
cozened, all the Earls, and was related to every one
of them.
The next degree is that of Wiscount, or vice comes;
which, though we have turned on the gas of research
from the inain of history, we are unable to throw a
light upon.
The last, and most general degree of nobility, is
that of Baron, which was formerly so numerous, that
the King summoned only the greater ones to the
council of the nation, and the others gradually
became extinct—except the barony of Nathan, the
holder of which, though not enjoying a seat in the
peers, occupies a seat in or near the (Kennington)
Commons.
Peerages were formerly annexed to lands; and
even now there are some piers—such as those of
Westminster-bridge—which only exist by the hold
they have upon the soil ; but this sort of tenure has
now become very uncertain.
Peers are now created by writ or by patent; so
that, when a sheriff's officer serves a person with a
writ, he is said to be made a-ppear (a peer) by the
writ being served on him. But every one who is
summoned by a writ is not ennobled, and it is now
usual to make peers by the batch.
Let us now examine the privileges of nobility, the first of which is the , before their creation.

block tin dish-covers, must be considered Esquires while engaged in the
performance of Richard the Third, but no longer. Camden, who was
himself a herald, and blew the trumpet vigorously for any one who paid
him, makes four degrees of Esquires. First, the eldest sons of knights,
and their eldest sons, in successional crops, like broad beans or radishes.
Second, the eldest sons of younger sons of peers, and their eldest sons in
like succession ; so that Baron Nathan's youngest son's eldest boy's first-
born male infant would be an Esquire, supposing the Barony of Nathan to
be acknowledged as a branch of the tree of English aristocracy. Third,
Esquires created, like Baker's mangles, by patent. Fourth, Esquires who
are so called from holding a place of trust under the crown; but it is not
decided whether the waiter at the Crown and Anchor comes under this
head, as holding a place of trust under the Crown, the words “and
Anchor” being rejected as surplusage.
As for Gentlemen, says Sir Thomas Smith, they who can live idly, and
bear the port and charge of a gentleman—that is to say, can pay what is
charged for port, and sit idly over it—shall be taken for a Gentleman. A
Yeoman is one who hath land that brings him in forty shillings a year;
but semble that a crossing, the sweeping of which produces forty shillings
a year, does not constitute the sweeper a Yeoman.
The rest of the community are tradesmen, artificers, and labourers,
who must all be styled, in legal proceedings, by their estate or mystery;
but the estates of most of them would be a mystery indeed to any one
attempting to describe them.
Such is the Civil State, which we have stated as civilly as circumstances
will admit of.
“DESTITUTION AT THE WEST END.”
The Times relates some melancholy proofs of “destitution at the
west end,” and mentions the establishment of a “refuge for the
houseless.” We have been favoured, “from our own correspondent,”
with several other melancholy instances of distress among the
higher classes.
The Duke of Post-obit, who has, within these few years, come
into possession of a rent-roll of eighty thousand a year, has been
under the painful necessity of “raising the wind” at the rate of
forty and sixty per cent. So hard has his Grace been run, that we
are assured, upon competent authority, that he has actually been
driven—to ask a bill-discounter to dine with him I
Another noble Duke has given a melancholy proof of the march
of mendicity. He was recently applied to by the tutor of his youth,
with whom he had continued on terms of affectionate intimacy, for
the loan of a hundred pounds to save him from a gaol. His Grace
was reduced to the sad extremity of confessing that he had been
“hit rather hard at Newmarket,” and most reluctantly declined.
The noble Duke has, indeed, but sixty thousand a year, out of which
he has the junior members of his family to educate.
A noble Marquis, the produce of whose estate has been, through
certain causes, deteriorated at least five per cent. per annum, and
barely brings him in fifty thousand pounds clear, has been put to the
most painful and humiliating shifts. At a magnificent ball, at which—
we have the Morning Post's authority and French for the fact—the élite
of rank and fashion was present, the “men in possession” were
put into liveries, of which there are always a few spare suits in his
lordship's establishments for these painful emergencies. What adds
to the pain of the recital is, that the ball itself cost more money than
would have discharged the whole of the persecuting creditors'
demands.
A fashionable Colonel, who has experienced some severe vicissi-
tudes at Crockford's, was recently driven to such an appalling state
of destitution, that he actually, for the sake of raising a few hundreds,
pledged his word of honour to a lie To be sure, “he did the Jew.”
and the incident afforded a hearty laugh at mess. But the Colonel's
face of bronze has worn a humbler expression since this voluntary
debasement.
The Income-tax, while it has been the cause of some undoubted
“drawing in of the horns” on the whole has been found a very
convenient excuse for shabbiness and retrenchment. “My loves.”
said the Dowager Lady Hookring to her three eldest unmarried
Jaughters, “we really must not think of going to town this season.
I positively can't afford it while that odious Property-tax is to be
paid.” The indignant remonstrances of the young ladies effected a
compromise, by which a furnished house in Eaton-square, at twenty-
five guineas a week, was secured to the end of July, and the future
services of the governess (who was paid at the fearfully extravagant
rate of forty pounds a year !) were dispensed with.
A Viscount of large landed estates has, we are credibly informed,
felt the pressure of the times so remarkably hard upon him, that he
has actually condescended to borrow the whole savings of his own
housekeeper The distress of his Lordship may be better imagined
than described, when we state that he really would have borrowed
“a cool hundred” of his butler, had not that respectful servitor felt
the honour of being his master's creditor a piece of presumption he
could not be guilty of - -
It is pleasing to hear, among so many painful instances of priva-
tion and straitened means, that a few of the most distinguished
leaders of ton have determined on some vigorous means of retrench-
ment. The Countess of , who invariably has a blonde head-
dress for every night of the Opera season, at the cost of five guineas,
and which of course becomes afterwards the perquisite of her maid,
has declared her intention of omitting Thursdays, for the sake of
economy. As a necessary consequence, not only ladies' maids, but
milliners and their assistants, must feel the effects of this contracted
expenditure.
Among the junior members of the aristocracy—younger brothers
and gentlemen of acknowledged limited income—the symptoms of
distress have become most unequivocal. A middle-aged Baronet,
who, when he dines at his own cost, either selects Clarendon or
Grillion's, and picks his teeth at the moderate charge of two pounds
twelve and sixpence, has actually been detected, at a late hour of
the evening, when the coffee-room was nearly cleared, dining at his
club, on a simple dinner of three courses, at the ridiculously low
charge of eighteen and sixpence 1 The Hon. — —, who has
hitherto engaged an opera-box for the exclusive use of himself, and
such friends as he may invite, has subscribed for a share in “the
Omnibus-box,” and has been heard confidentially to declare that
the stalls are not “so decidedly low” as he once voted them. In the
same spirit of economy, Major , of the – Guards, has limited
his orders to Nugee for five waistcoats in the week (having usually
bespoke one for each day); &nd, as we are credibly informed, has
been seen for two successive mornings in the same robe-de-chambre.
But this, we suspect, must be an exaggeration.
Many ladies of rank and title, anxious to compete with their
husbands in this laudable rivalry, have consented to the most fearful
sacrifices. Several of them have withdrawn their subscriptions of
from one to five guineas annually from most deserving charities,
which they had previously declared they could not exist without
supporting; and their husbands, not to appear insensible to this
affecting proof of self-denial, have actually not paid the subscriptions
to which they had put their names down.
Amongst the landed proprietors, the pressure of the times has been
equally insupportable; not only have the coals and flannel usually
distributed to the poor been omitted, but the Christmas Festivities
either altogether dispensed with, or sadly curtailed.
Tºe demand for exotics is, we also hear, most lamentably on the
Secline; bouquets which should have been given away at a guinea and
five-and-twenty shillings, actually have withered for want of cus-
tomers, even at those absurd prices !
We have many other sad illustrations of destitution at the West-
end; and have positively heard it hinted, that in case the distress
continues, St. James's Palace will be thrown open as a refuge for
the unfortunate sufferers. Ude has signified his willingness to
mitigate the privation of such a receptacle, by superintending the
culinary arrangements; and Gillow's and three other fashionable
upholsterers have sent in estimates and designs for its internal
furnishing decoration. We have arrived at fearful times indeed.
O'Connell taking his trial at Dublin, and younger sons living on five

CAN DID CONSTRUCTION.
The Times of Thursday, Jan. 25, contains the following advertisement:
“Church PREFERMENT.--To be Sold, the next Presentation to two several very
desirable Livings, viz.:--To a Rectory, situate in the county of S-, within a few miles
of several good market towns, and at a convenient distance from a railway station. There
is a good Parsonage-house, and about sixty acres of glebe. The tithes have been com-
muted; and the income, exclusive of the glebe and surplice fees, is about 1,050l. per
annum. The incumbent is in his 59th year. To another Rectory, &c.”
What a pity it is that advertisements are so expensive 1 The above is
open to misconstruction nearly from beginning to end. Almost every
clause of it, therefore, requires a commentary; but then its insertion
would have been frightfully chargeable.
The first sentence informs us, that the next presentation to two very
desirable livings is to be sold.
LARMN ſ

nuur -----.
The announcement may, to the unthinking, seem to savour of simony.
No such thing Simony is the sale of Church preferment ; the sale
here advertised is merely the sale of Church preferment contingent upon
the death of its present holders: which is quite a different matter. The
livings, it will have been observed, are represented as being very desirable.
Let it not be supposed that, by “very desirable” is meant “very lucra-
tive,” or “very snug,” because we know that a loftier gain than lucre is
the object of a clergyman, and that his business is to labour for the
spiritual welfare of his flock; and not to make himself snug.
The statement, that the Rectory in the county of S-lies near
“several good market towns, and at a convenient distance from a railway
station,” is no hint that luxuries are easily accessible, and the pleasures of
the metropolis at speedy command. No ; it simply means, that there are
places at hand where food, clothing, and good books may be bought, in
charity, for the poor; and where conferences on religious subjects and
for benevolent purposes, may be had, on market days, with the neighbour-
ing gentry and farmers. Also, that there are facilities for getting up
quickly to London, to attend missionary and philanthropic meetings, and
transact clerical business when necessary.
The fact, that there is a good parsonage house, is mentioned to show
the opportunity which exists for the practice of hospitality; and the
“sixty acres of glebe,” are adverted to, no doubt, with a view to the capa-
.bilities which they afford for the employment of the necessitous, and the
promotion of agricultural industry.
The amount of the income is stated to indicate the surplus, which,
after subtraction of the amount required to live upon, will remain to be
expended in doing good.
The age of the incumbent is specified, in order to excite the hope that,
though he is now fifty-nine, and will very soon be sixty, yet, notwithstand-
ing, he may live till seventy or eighty, or longer, in the enjoyment of his
present means of conferring happiness on those around him.
What has been said in explanation of the announcements respecting the
first Rectory is applicable, also, to those concerning the second. In
addition, therefore, Punch will only say, that he hopes, if for a moment
he has forgotten the humourist in the commentator, that he will be par-
, doned on the score of his good intentions.

IN allusion to a recent challenge, the Dublin Authorities have been

DEBUT OF HER MAJESTY'S STATE COACHMAN.
An immense assemblage of persons had collected on the day of the
opening of Parliament, in order to witness the first appearance of
Mr. Baker in the arduous part of State Coachman to Her Majesty. In
the earlier scenes he evinced considerable nervousness, and the leaving
the stable yard was greatly marred by a tremulousness of the nose and
eye-brow, bespeaking an agitation in the débutant which it was really
painful to look upon. A slight shout of “Go it, Bob,” from the head
ostler, seemed to revive Mr. Baker, who §. up the reins and
cracked the whip with an air of confidence that gave every hope of his
début being successful. The grand point of the performance, indeed the
touchstone of the powers of the artist, was the drawing up at the door of
the House of Lords, and here Mr. Baker's effective pantomime came very
freely into play, for the splendid manner in which he contrived to keep
up a protracted squint, so as to have one eye on the coach-door to see
when her Majesty had alighted, and the other on his horses, elicited
shouts of enthusiasm from the numerous individuals assembled to witness
it. On the whole, the début must be regarded as perfectly successful.
Mr. Baker's style wants the delicacy of Wimbush, and is without the
dash or buoyancy of the Blackwall School; but, as a piece of tasteful and
quiet coachmanship, it may rank with some of the highest efforts of our
very ablest drivers.
The Martyr Gibbs.
A few of the Aldermen, in order to mark their sense of the “shameful
misrepresentations” of which poor Alderman Gibbs has been made the
victim, intend to erect a statue to the great aceountant. He will be
represented in the abstract character of Magnanimity “smiling at ”Arith-
metic. Thus, the Alderman having been wickedly abused by the vile
press, will at length be “cut” by his best friends.

THE OPENING OF THE SESSION,
(A Leader for the Post.)
HE shrill blast of the British trumpet has
blown the glad note of the Constitution into the
patriotic ear, and the bounding heart beats in
the bursting bosom of every one who loves his
land and her laws—his hearth, his hob, his
household gods, and all the other contingencies
which make the soil of England the soil of
liberty.
Parliament has opened. Time has blown
another tremendous trump from his shrill cla-
rion. Neptune again digs his trident into the
water at his side, and “Britannia rules the
Waves” is the burden of the joyous paean.
It seldom happens that a speech from the
throne is so thoroughly satisfactory as that
Trade is revived. Stockings
that lately hung unsold in the windows at nine and a half (we
mean 94d.) have appeared with altered coupons, rating them at a
higher and a fairer figure. Prosperity is literally gushing from
the pockets of the people, and plenty is reeling about in rampant
luxuriance. The sal volatile of a good harvest has been applied to
the nostrils of trade, which has wonderfully revived in consequence;
and it is a notorious fact, that abundance is going about begging for
some one to adopt as his own its numerous advantages. In the em-
phatic words of somebody, “There never were such times;” and in
the still more emphatic words of somebody else, but no—we will
not be too eager to boast, lest, like the Thracian commander, we are
compelled to cry, “Who’d have thought it t”
GOVERNMENT ADWERTISEMENT.
Wºº for Ireland, an Attorney-General, who will be ready to
challenge not only jurors but Counsel themselves, and who will be
prepared to fight the battles of the Crown with pistols—the question
of a defendant being “worth powder and shot” having a strictly
literal meaning, which may be resolved on application to the
defendant's advocate. The applicant for the office must be willing
to give every one satisfaction by means of pistols—but not otherwise;
—a disregard to the dignity and authority of the Bench, evincing an
independence of spirit, will be liberally treated with ; and any one
against whom the public, on all sides, may have been calling out, will
not be objected to, if he calls out one of his learned brethren.
MONKS AND MAGISTRATES.
“It seems now to be a regular part of the magistrate's duties, after the ordinary
nusiness of the Court is over, to attend to the appeals for relief from the crowds of
squalid and emaciated applicants who may be seen daily congregated in the waiting-
room.”—Morning Post.
In the good old times—old times, by the way, appear to have been
always good—of rosary and paternoster, the monk was made the
almoner to the poor : the door of the monastery was sought by the
“squalid and emaciated,” and the charities of the rich and pious
were doled out by the frocked sons of the church. The good old times
are past and gone, and the wickedness of the present is upon us.
Nevertheless, we have our appointed almoners. Monks Francis and
Hildebrand and Lawrence are succeeded by Fathers Broughton,
Broderip, and Twyford: the friar re-appears in the magistrate. The
monastery is a picturesque ruin, tenanted by owls and lizards; but
the “waiting-room” of Marlborough-street police-office is made
populous by human misery and destitution. The “ladye” of the
baron or knight—the merchant's or the yeoman's wife, no longer
sends her poor's-gift through the church, but through the police :
justice is made alms-giver; and for the thanks and praises of the
friar, we have instead a due acknowledgment in the Times and
Chronicle.
We fear this state of things has escaped the perception of those
particularly excellent people, who would make the human heart a
mere clause in an Act of Parliament, and who very properly discou-
rage all benevolence as eccentric and injurious, save that paid upon
receipt to the man duly authorised to collect the poor's-rate. The
foolish people who rejoice that “A. B.” should send “10s. for the
widow West,” forget, in the ignorance of their gladness, the danger
that such improvident charity may bring upon our noblest institutions.
We have looked very deeply, indeed, into this mill-stone, and are at
once prepared to publish the result of our labour. We do not hesi-
tate to state the fact, that we believe both Church and good govern-
ment to be in peril from the unthinking deeds of people, who will
send their gold and silver to the police-offices for the relief of the
poor, when the said subscribers should keep their pockets buttoned,
and think serenely and gratefully upon the virtues of Somerset
House. To make magistrates the dolers-out of private alms, what
is it, we ask, but to offer a pains-taking insult to the Poor Law
Commissioners? -
Before, however, we proceed to paint the evil in all its natural
deformity, let us in candour allow that the practice of making a
police-court a temporary place of refuge for destitution—of accus-
toming the people to associate a place of punishment with a place of
charity—is, very properly, calculated to perpetuate the union between
guilt and poverty; making them, indeed, bone of each other's bone
—flesh of each other's flesh, a marriage which even Poor Law Com-
missioners respect, never—as in the case of vulgar wedlock—
separating the parties. Thus, that starvation should seek a loaf where
crime is awarded handcuffs, is, we insist upon it, very properly to
associate destitution with wickedness; an association which, with good
reason, makes much of the pride of the thrifty and respectable people
in this our respectable world.
That, however, the Established Church is in danger from the
practice of making magistrates almsgivers, cannot have escaped
the aquiline observation of such men as Colonel SIRT horp and Mr.
PLUMPTRE, though, oddly enough, they have hitherto been mute as
oysters on the circumstance. We can see in this the invidious
attempts of Puseyism, which seeks to bring into disrepute the rectors
and curates of the Established Church, to the present time—the fact
is notorious !—visitants at the hovels of the London poor. We have
already had a sort of side-wind proposal in the House of Commons to
establish lay-monasteries and nunneries; and this continual sending
of alms to magistrates, instead of entrusting them to the clergy of the
parish, results from the same active and dangerous spirit. A man
with a properly-constituted nose may smell Puseyism, where duller
organs apprehend nothing but the mere odour of charity. For our
own part, we shall scorn to be surprised if some day Mr. Broughton
takes his seat with a rosary at his side, and Mr Twyford appears—
all the merely criminal cases disposed of—frocked and cowled.
And next to the insult offered to Somerset-House. We contend,
that every shilling sent to a police-office for the aid of any calamity
thereat whimpering, is an overt act of disaffection to that govern-
ment which has placed, as it were, the heart-strings of the menial
poor in the tender hands of judicious commissioners. We are not
skilled in the many beautiful bye-ways of law—it is with a sigh that
we confess our ignorance—yet have we a lively faith that the reck-
less subscribers to the police poor-box might, somehow, be reached
by the castigating spirit of some statute.
For the present, however, we shall content ourselves with two
indignant questions: Is charity only to be found with street-walkers,
at a police-office —Are Magistrates to be made Monks 1
A SONG FOR THE MILLION.

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS.
It is not generally known that the new medicine “Morphine,” so
fashionable now with the faculty for its narcotic qualities, is extracted
from Files of the Morning Post, boiled down to a pulp, and subjected to
a strong chemical process. In consequence of these virtues, it is ru-
moured that the name of the journal in question will shortly be changed
to “The Morning Morpheus,” and that its readers, for their better
sleeping accommodation, will, in future, be provided with two “sheets”
instead of one.

WAYS AND MEANS.
HEN the poor man's loaf
j is taxed; when the very
malt and hops of our
daily drink are tributary;
when an impost is levied
on tea, coffee, tobacco,
snuff, vinegar, pepper,
and the light of heaven;
when, in short, from
every necessary that sus-
tains, or luxury that
sweetens, existence, a
per-centage is extorted
for the maintenance of
the revenue; when, to
crown all, we are saddled
with the Income-Tax;
and when John Bull may be so truly said to resemble a sponge wrung
dry, or a lemon which has yielded its last drop to the punch-bowl, that it
is difficult to determine which of the two he is most like; surely to over-
look any obvious means of securing to the Exchequer contributions which
would be unfelt by the people, is a piece of culpable negligence on the part
of the Government.
To those who have given the least attention to the subject of Finance,
many such sources of national income must have occurred. We will
mention one which has struck us: we have often to resolve ourselves
into a Committee of Ways and Means on our own account, and having
dispatched our private affairs, we generally proceed to settle those of the
nation.
The metropolis abounds in statues of eminent men, and almost every
day adds to their number. They are erected with very laudable intentions,
namely, to honour the memory of those whom they represent, to adorn
their respective localities, and to benefit the starved-out sculptors, with
whom the present times are very hard.
In all, these objects, except the last, they fail most signally. They
are decided caricatures and undeniable eyesores, and gratify none but
foreigners, to whom they afford high diversion at the expense of British
art.
Not being ornamental, then, the question is, could they not be rendered
useful ? Undoubtedly they could. The use to which we would have
them applied is precisely that made of certain other things that are
voted fit for nothing else;—dead walls, barriers, and the shoulders of
Poor people. Let them be made the vehicles of advertisements. The
effigy of George the Third, for instance, might be invested in the tabard
which we so often see worn about the streets, recommendatory of washable
hats, tally-ho sauce, industrious fleas, and pictorial newspapers. To the
royal right arm might be affixed a standard, inscribed with an invitation
“To persons about to Marry.” . A monster play-bill might dangle from
: charger's neck, and an Exeter Hall announcement be appended to
is tail.
The back of George the Fourth in Trafalgar Square is uncourteously
turned to the public ; a position very unbecoming to the first gentleman
(that was) of Europe. How appropriately it might be graced with a
notification of Moses's The Sovereign, in his life-time, was very tasty
in dress.
Lord Nelson stands too high to bear an ordinary placard to any pur-
F. but he might hold a huge flag of the nature of a union-jack ; and
. Jullien, who has a fine eye for a poster, could advertise his Concerts
thereon. His late Royal Highness the Duke of York might display a
“Guide to 100 Loan Societies” in the same way.
Lastly, the whole front of the National Gallery might be rendered very
serviceable, and have its deformities concealed besides, by being over-
spread with notices and bills, whose various colours, red, blue, green, and
yellow, would agreeably diversify it. By the by, the different police-vans,
otherwise termed Her Majesty's omnibuses, might be thus decorated to
great advantage.
For every advertisement a certain sum should be demanded, of an
amount proportioned to its size, the prominence and importance of its
situation, and the time for which it is to remain: the money thus raised
to be placed at the disposal of the Government.
THE AWFUL STATE OF IRELAND !
M1st ER Punch,
I have offen red and herd of the friteful State of Ireland And
the Unsecuritty of life and Propperty in that distractid Country. But
if all is trew, witch sum times it isn’t, even the most peasable parts
of the Isle of Herein can’t be habittable for a Protestint Clergy Man
xcept he's an impregnable Knight in Armer or an invulnerabel
Rinocerus.
I allude to the Lady's Letter as was brought forrard by Lord
Eldon in the Upper House. From witch it appear, as to I-burn-ye,
alias Ireland, even in the most bewtiful distrix insted of bein in
Parradis, the more youre Blest the more youre Cust. Cos why? A
power of good wishes is all the same as a shower of slugs and a hearty
Bennediction on one's Head as fatal as a fractured Perrycranum with
a Spaid or a turfin irun. Whereby it follows yure never safe in yure
Skin xcept you go clothed with Cusses as with a Garmint, or sum-
boddy is saying sumthing I can't repeat at yure Eyes or yure Blud or
yure Lims. But for fear of mistakes here is the hole account
verbatum:—
“It was with the most painful feelings that he (Lord Eldon) contemplated those disturb-
ances, and a letter which he had received a few days ago from Ireland, written by a young
lady, a relation of his, the daughter of a clergyman residing there, had convinced him that
the country could scarcely be in a more deplorable state than it was in at present. * *
After mentioning that the part of the country whence she wrote was in a peaceful state,
and that a thought of danger scarcely ever entered their heads, she continued:—“Not
so our neighbours. Some of them have fortified their houses, expecting nightly
massacres.” Her father said that he constantly received blessings from the poor people
as he passed along the road. They said, “God Almighty bless your reverence, and shield
you from every danger,” or words to that effect; and they were people whose faces he was
unacquainted with, but who seemed as if they knew that some danger was ...;
and wished to warn him. Thus, in a parish where there were not at present disturb-
ances, the clergyman cannot receive the blessings of his parishioners without their
exciting in him feelings of upprehension and alarm.”
Now I have a dray horse, meself, bred by the cellibratted Joe
Miller, as draws Innfurrences. But he never drew sich a heavy Inn-
furinse as that, nor couldn’t. No, not if you give him a Bushell of
Beens soaked in Beer. And if so be he could, he’d scorn to do it,
for tho he's strong he's marciful And never kicks at Human Natur.
For my own part I don't mind saying I offen lays out a trifle with
a Begger for the sake of his good wurd for me with Heven, witch
most of us and even the best of us wants God knows. And not a
bad bargin nayther considdrin a man can git blest as cheap as he can
git shaved. Namely a penny a time. Besides witch sum of the
werry grateful ones will chuck you in a kind look gratis as does yure
Hart good to see. And so there's nuthin lost on ayther side. But
wat's to becum of Charrity and mutual feelings, not only between
Man and Man, But man womman and Child in different spears of
life, if so be the more Heven is axed to purtect me the more I
shout out for the Pollice And the faster and warmer I'm prayed for,
the sooner thinks I, there’ll be need of the Crowner
If I was Lord Elldon witch I needn’t say I ham not, sooner than
have red that Letter in Publick I'd have chawed it up into pappier
mashy for a tobacker stopper or towards a tebord for the tetotlers.

PHYSIOLOGY OF AN “OCCASIONAL CORRESPONDENT.”
THE readers of morning newspapers must often have been struck by
the “Letters to the Editor,” which generally answer the double pur-
ose of showing the great industry and the small wisdom of the writers.
e mean, not the able political letters which appear in every journal
To theatres the “father ” does not often go, as he says, in rather a
boastful tone, that his time for that sort of thing is past. Nevertheless,
he sometimes makes an effort to afford his family a dramatic treat at
Christmas, particularly if he has a friend who gives away an order or
two. . These treats are especially unlucky. Certain is it, that when the
“Father of a Family” visits a theatre, something verging on impropriety
takes place. If there be a petticoat shorter than the rest in the wardrobe,
that is sure to be worn by one of the danseuses on that particular occa-
sion; if there is one old comedy more replete than another with jokes of
an equivocal nature, that is played as if for the very purpose of making
the two tall young ladies blush, while it has the additional bad effect of
making the stiff-frilled son laugh uproariously, until checked by an un-
mistakeable glance from his sire, shocked that his offspring has not inhe-
rited his own stern abhorrence of the improper. Entering the hackney-
coach that is to take him back to his suburban retreat, he observes that
“theatres, after all, are bad places for young folks”—to which the tall
young ladies blandly assent, while the less virtuous lad says nothing.
These annoyances have made our friend particularly watchful about
theatres, and he is always afraid that the editors of newspapers are not
sufficiently vigilant in scenting out an impropriety. Accordingly it is in
the family records that he never went to the theatre without writing five
letters to the Times, three to the Chronicle and Herald, and one to the
of eminence, but the details of petty grievances that are subscribed
“Father of a Family,” “Constant er,” “Anti-Humbug,” &c. The
gentry who write these letters have fancied themselves safe from all
publicity, and that their privilege of inflicting any twaddle they please
upon any unfortunate editor they select as a victim is absolutely unlimited.
We are going to prove the contrary, and therefore determine to show up
THE “FATHER of A FAMILY,”
Selecting him because he is the very prince of “bores.” So many are
the grievances which he would make public, that he is alike the terror of
editors and the delight of the small stationer in his neighbourhood.
consumption of paper is tremendous.
To reach his dwelling from the city, you must pass Shoreditch Church,
‘. . we shall not tell you whether you are to go down the Hackney or
the Kingsland Road. The residence is neat-looking enough, being well
whitewashed in front, while a kind of archway of green lath stands before
the door. It has, moreover, the great convenience of affording a view of
every passing omnibus. The “Paterfamilias” himself is on the shady
side of fifty, and is dressed with a regard rather to respectability than to
elegance. . He usually bends in his back, and holds his head remarkably
high, particularly when he indulges in conversation with a small party
before dinner. His wisdom is of the same class as that possessed by
ancient nurses and washerwomen; but, nevertheless, he is able to give
his aphorisms a certain weight by the deep voice in which he pronounces
them, and by the loud clearing of the throat by which they are prefaced.
Consequently, he passes among his fellow-travellers in the omnibus for a
decidedly sound-thinking man.
The family, of which he is constantly telling the public that he is the
father, consists of two very tall thin girls, whose noses grow excessively
red in cold weather, and a boy in the teens, who continues to wear a stiff
frill at a period when most lads have assumed a collar, or even a tail-coat.
The young ladies pass their time inanely enough. They draw a little,
and they oriental-tint a little, and they occasionally inflict on the neigh-
bours who drop in to tea a very long duet on the piano. The songs they
sing are invariably those which have attained the very slightest popula-
rity ; and they are always executed in a voice so small as to be nearly
inaudible. The young gentleman looks in the presence of his father, as if
“butter would not melt in his mouth.” To his moral education the
greatest attention has been paid. Particular inquiries were made as to
the gentility and perfect propriety of the seminary to which le was sent;
and the son of Mr. Wingo next door, having been heard to wish that his
buttons were “dashed,” and to utter the horrid exclamation “By Jingo,”
all communication with Wingo junior is expressly interdicted. Never-
theless, if the legendary records of the neighbourhood are to be believed,
the son of the “Father of a Family,” was once detected in the ghastly

champion,
It is not so much against immorality in the abstract, that he is a
as he is indignant that the particular minds of his own spotless
Rosa Matilda and Anna Maria have been shocked, and he is always at
| great pains to inform the editor of the journal he addresses, that he writes
his letter, because he feels it is his “ duty as a father” so to do. The
profane introduction of the “ANGEL Inn, Islington,” in the presence of
his three children, caused a tremendous order on the stationer. The
whole country was, in the opinion of the “Father,” likely to be swallowed
up by an earthquake, with Rosa Matilda and Anna Maria in it, unless
he, the father, stepped forward to stop the abomination. Alas ! the daily
papers took no notice of his communication, and a Sunday paper, to which
he at last had refuge, merely told him “A Father of a Family is an Ass.”
This, by the way, greatly disgusted him with the Sunday press, and his
heart beat highly, when the saints of Islington interfered with the vendors
of the weekly newspapers.
Generally, his communications, which are always of a moral tendency,
are unlucky; and out of a hundred letters which he writes, not above one
finds its way into type. Nevertheless, he is not discouraged; and at this
very moment he is working away at the impropriety of the piece called
“Blue Devils.”
A Bequitur.
We understand that during the burning of King William's College, the

THE FOUNTAINS IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE.
“thereby haNgs a rail.”
The Commissioners of the Fine Arts have been for some time deli.
berating how to supply the fountains in Trafalgar Square. The extreme
difficulty of supplying the Dolphin's tail with a pure and healthful stream
of the limpid element, has been a theme of the most painful discussion.
The question has, however, been at length set finally at rest, by the de-
termination of the Commissioners to adopt the method of Artesian Wells,
which has led to the following
SONG OF THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE FINE ARTS.
How shall we bid the fountains flow,
In streamlets bright and fair,
To give a genial warmth and glow
To gay Trafalgar Square :
Oh, shall we seek it from the main
Of the New River Head ;
That river circling through the plain,
Like some small silver thread Î
Or shall we, from the plug that lurks
Beneath the pavement stone ;
That plug the Junction Water Works
Are proud to call their own
Or shall we, from the gushing Thames,
Conduct the fluid mild,
That fluid whose opaqueness shames
Far India's sun-black'd child
No, rather let us make a push
For Art—the way's an easy'un ;
Yes, with Science let us rush,
And sink the Well Artesian.

ETIQUETTE FOR PRISONS.
In consequence of complaints that have been made by persons
committed to prison before trial, who object to their not being allowed
to mix with other prisoners, it has been thought necessary to frame
a Book of Etiquette for prison purposes. Of course a superior delin-
quent, like a forger, could not be on visiting terms with a mere pick-
pocket, nor could a man charged with stealing a hundred pounds,
feel at his ease in the society of one whose alleged theft might be
mean and insignificant.
It is, we believe, intended to introduce the prisoners to each other
formally, not by name, but by the offence with which they are
charged. Thus, the Governor of Newgate would say to a Felony—
“Allow me to introduce you to this Aggravated Larceny. You ought
to know each other—indeed you ought. Aggravated Larceny-
Felony—Felony—Aggravated Larceny.” By a nice adjustment and
proper application of the rules of etiquette, a very admirable system
of social intercourse might be established in all our prisons, and
the present complaint of a want of “good society,” which falls so
severely on superior scoundrels, would at once be got rid of.
THE DUEL THAT DID NOT COME OFF.
The attempt to turn the Irish Court of Queen's Bench into a Court of
Honour is no doubt highly creditable to Attorney-General Smith, whose
chivalrous feeling is worthy the days of the old Templars, when every
utter barrister was a crested knight, and every clerk was a coated and
mailed esquire. We confess we see nothing extraordinary in the conduct
of the Irish Attorney-General, and are ready to sing,
“Oh I 'tis a glorious sight to see,
The charge of the legal chivalry | **
We can fully appreciate the knightly emotions of Smith on being fretted,
worried, teased, and tormented, by Fitzgibbon, and the following
LAY OF THE AT TORNEY-GENERAL
might have been written by one of the old chroniclers, and sung by one
of the young troubadours, as the
LeGAL WArt-WHOOP.

Then follow up your chief,

Of some old artful hen.

That grasps the golden fee ;

TNooks amb Corners of QBlt 3Englamb.
hydrº park Corner.
Among the Nooks and Corners of “Merrie Englande,” there is no
Corner so full of historical associations as Hyde Park Corner. There is
no doubt that when John found himself driven up into a corner by the
Barons, Hyde Park Corner was the very corner that the Barons drove
him up into, for “we all know,” says Jones, “that Hyde Park Corner is
on the way to Runnymede.” It is to be regretted that all our old asso-
ciations are being swept away by Time, that most inveterate of sweepers,
whose besom has a year concealed in every twig and a whole era in
the handle. Hyde Park is still there, but the Corner is a corner no longer,
having been cruelly rounded off, by the too active hand of Innovation.
Still we may cling to the palings with affectionate enthusiasm, as marking
where the corner either was, or might have been.
Hyde Park Corner was once remarkable for a custom of levying
tribute on horsemen and carriages, and the first nobles in the land would be
seen to stop and accede to the demand that was made upon them. Hyde
Park Corner is now unknown even to the natives, who are so steeped in
ignorance that they allude to the Chinese Exhibition as being at Hyde
Park Corner, though the Corner of Hyde Park is not within several
hundred yards of it. With this very important remark we close for the
present our sketches of the Nooks and Corners of Old England.
Iliterary Intelligence.
We understand that the Keeper of the Burlington Arcade is preparing
his biography for the press, under the title of the “Burlington Papers.”
The book will include some curious particulars of the Patten Rebellion in
1825, when several ladies insisted on walking through without taking off

clogs, but the matter is sufficiently interesting in itself to make it a fine
subject for the historian.
“A Month at Brixton ; or, Life on the Tread-Mill,” is the title of a new

“And turn, and turn again, and still go on.”
Singular Coincidence.
LoRD BRough AM is reported to have visited Drury Lane Theatre on
Thursday evening, after attending the House of Lords. This seems to
be an absurd repetition of the same thing, for the principal scene of the
Pantomime represents the “ABoDE of IDLENEss.”

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTert the thirteenthºſe MILITARY AND MARITIME
he Military State includes the whole
of the soldiery from the Com-
mander-in-Chief down to the raw
recruit, or the private who has the
honour of being stationed at the post
of Storey's-gate, who is alluded to by
the poet, in the fine line—
“The post of honour is a private station.”
In a free country, it is said that
the soldier is an object of jealousy,
chiefly we suppose, on account of the
impression made by a red coat upon
the fair sex. As to any other kind
of jealousy the soldier creates, we are
certainly not aware of it, unless it be
the natural jealousy felt by a police-
man at the superiority of the steel
bayonet over the wooden staff, and
the cartridge box over the lanthorn. A soldier does not put off the citizen
when he becomes a soldier; and consequently many of our gallant army
whose wives are washerwomen, carry out the clothes in time of peace, and
others lend a hand in the mangling—which, according to the ºld jurists;
is not out of character with their slaughtering propensities. The laws of
this country do not recognise a standing army 5 so that even when on
service, the soldiers are said to go to the seat of war—thus showing that
a standing army is never contemplated. - -----
All historians agree in declaring that Alfred invented the Militia, when
every man in the kingdom was a soldier; and, considering what sort of
soldiers the militia usually are, we should say that every man, woman, or
child might have been. In those days, the
Dukes led the soldiers, and had such power, that
Duke Harold, although the wrongful heir, was
strong enough to push from off the throne one
Edgar Atheling, the rightful heir—an event,
which if the Saxons had had a taste for melo-
drama, would have made a fine subject for a
piece, introducing “a grand combat of two"—
including all the popular business of Harold
cutting at Edgar Atheling's toes, while Edgar
Athºlin; jumped up exclaiming, “No, you
don't l” with a wink at the prime minister.
Then, of course, would have come the grand last
movement of clashing of swords together across
the stage, till both disappear at the wing, when
Harold would have returned alone, with both
swords, in token of victory, and taken his seat
on the throne—in which position he might have
been “closed in " by the scene-shifters.
We have already, in a former chapter, spoken
of the necessity a Knight was under to go for a
soldier in case of war, but in peace the country
was protected by a statute of Henry the Second,
making it obligatory on every man to keep a cer-
tain quantity of arms; but it does not appear
there was any law insisting on his knowing the
use of them. These persons were, however, now
and then called out, arms and all; and it is
presumed this was done. as Camden hints, “to
ennjoye a joyke at ye expennsse of ye people.”
It is not, perhaps, generally known, that the
whole of the dreadful row between Charles the
First and the people, arose out of a dispute
about the militia—the King pulling at them one
way and the Parliament the other. The militia
all the while was in those days just what it is in
these—very indifferent.
After the restoration of Charles the Second,
the King's right to do what he liked with the
militia was recognised ; and there is still a
renunant of them who rent a coal-shed at Lan-
caster, which is called the dépôt, and from which
three corpulent sergeants—for they are all offi-
cers and no men—would emerge in case of an
invasion. During the election riots, the Lancaster
militia put itself under the protection of the two policemen in the town,
but, in the glorious language of the Constitution, “the militia are, after all,
our great defence against foreign aggression.” “After all” means of course,
when everything else had been tried; and then, we say, Let England throw
herself into the arms of the three sergeants at the coal-shed at Lancaster.
Besides the Militia, there is also the Yeomanry, who are more often
called into service, and have several times distinguished themselves by
keeping back the boys at processions and on other public occasions. We
had almost forgotten to mention the Volunteers, who formerly had the
command of all the parochial engines, pumps, and fire-ladders. That
these troops would have stood fire manfully there can be no doubt, for their
valour under an incessant pelting of water, was frequently put to the test
during showers to which they were so often exposed, that it was once
in contemplation to add an umbrella to the regulation bayonet. The
Lumber Troop must not be forgotten, whose last recorded exploit was an
encounter with the landlord of the public-house where the troop has its
quarters.
Martial Law is a sort of law in which the military authorities do as they
like with their own, and hang soldiers wholesale for the sake of preserving
discipline. This can only be done in time of war; and it is now quite
settled, that if a lieutenant hang a private for the mere fun of the thing
in time of peace, it would be murder, for it is against Magna Charta ; so
that it is fortunate for the heads of her Majesty's Foot that Magna Charta
was hit upon.
There is an annual Mutiny Act which provides for the government of
the army; and, according to this, any soldier shamefully deserting a post—
such as walking away from the lamp-post at Storey's gate—or sleeping on
the said post (he must be a deuced clever fellow to manage that)—or
giving advice to a rebel (unless perhaps he advised a rebel to be off
about his business)—or making signs to the enemy (though surely he
might shake his fist at the foe)—would be liable to any punishment,
from death downwards to a drill, or from the strong-room upwards to the
scaffold.
There are, however, privileges belonging to the soldiery, such as the
right of making a will when on actual service, by merely saying how he
wishes to dispose of his property; so that, in the field of battle, if a
soldier sees a cannon ball coming towards his head, he has only to say,
“I give and bequeath all I have to so and so ;” and if any of his comrades
should have heard what he said, and live to repeat it and remember
exactly what it was, there is no doubt that the will would be a very good
will in its way, and certainly quite strong enough to convey as much
property as would probably be left by
The soldier who lives on his º,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
we think of the glory of the Navy, the valour of the British tar, the
hearts of oak, and all the rest of it, our timbers naturally begin to shiver,
and we involuntarily go through a sort of mental Naval hornpipe as a
tribute to the maritime prowess of Britannia, who has ruled the waves,
the whole waves, and nothing but the waves, from time immemorial.
The mode of manning the Navy is, in time of war, to resort to the
liberty of the press, or, in other words, to seize hold of any one who comes
in the way, and make “a heart of oak” of him, whether his heart may be
disposed to sympathise with wainscoating or not, and to turn him at once
into a British tar, by pitching him on board a vessel. , Some doubt has
been thrown on the legality of impressment, but Sir Michael Forster, who
is a regular special pleader, makes out that it must be a law, because it is
mentioned in other laws, though there is no law in existence to which the
other laws refer; and consequently, as A is to B, so is B to C, which makes
it as clear as A B C that A may B(e) pressed to go to C whenever
there is any occasion for his services. Thus the power of impressment
resides somewhere; but where that somewhere is, nobody knows; and, as
we are fortunately at peace, nobody thinks it worth while to inquire. It
has recently been enacted that no seaman shall serve more than three years
against his will, unless he is made to serve longer, and then he must; so
this boon to impressed seamen helps them out of their difficulty much in the
same way as the Irishman lengthened his ladder, by cutting a bit from the
top and joining it on at the bottom.
The privileges of soldiers and seamen are great; for, if the soldier loses
his arms in battle, there is Chelsea Hospital to lend him a hand ; and a
sailor who is deprived of both his legs by a cannon-ball, has nothing to do
but quietly to walk into Greenwich.
THE WRONGS OF “OGLE-SQUARE.”
Possibly the respectable reader is aware that a few eccentric
nobles and gentlemen, with time heavy upon their hands, have em-
1 loyed themselves in establishing an institution—a very pest-place
in a genteel neighbourhood—called the “Western Refuge for the
1ſouseless Poor : " Yes, there is absolutely such an institution
deforming and offending the beauty and delicacy of Ogle-square,
Marylebone Creatures, crawling before heaven with tatters upon
their backs, and famine in their faces, have been lured westward, as
obscene birds are lured by a carcase, by food and shelter offered at
the Asylum ! If this be not a nuisance—a social, legal nuisance,—
will Lord BRough AM, or any other lawyer of his inches, define the
thing Ogle-square very properly shrieks at the contamination.
Lifting her voice to heaven and the Marylebone vestry, she com-
plains in the shrill accents of a respectable woman who has been
elbowed by a dustman, or hustled by a sweep. Ogle-square against
the Refuge—the well-housed and well-fed rersus the unsheltered and
famishing. Such is the cause set down for trial :-
“A deputation of rate-payers from Ogle-square attended to present a memorial to the
vestry, praying them to use their influence in putting down the establishment, on ac-
count of the vast injury and to the i diate hood !----a
the assemblage of large bodies of destitute and houseless poor waiting to be relieved §
the institution.”
We have heard that many nervous people, believing destitution and
houselessness to be, like measles and scarlet fever, catching, walk
about the neighbourhood with camphor-bags as big as Dutch cheeses.
Respectable children, compelled, on their way to and from school, to
pass the aforesaid pestiferous “large bodies,” are bathed by their
anxious parents in hot vinegar on their return home. However, let
the ratepayers relate their miseries themselves :—
“The poor congregated around their houses from all parts of the metropolis, and
the nuisance was so great, they were obliged to shut up their shops, and the majority of
their lodgers had given them notice to quit.”
Mr. K1 RBY, one of the vestry, touched by the sorrows of Ogle-
square, moved “that the Duke of Portland” be solicited to “put
down the Establishment 1” Whereupon the vestry broke up.
The case of Ogle-square must find its way to the hearts of all
men; especially to those whose hearts are wise enough to contract
themselves, that they may reside in their breeches pockets.
Shakspeite’s historical lord complains of the “slovenly, unhand-
some corse” brought “between the wind and his nobility.” Now
surely a living poor man—a breathing thing festooned with rags, and
livid with hunger—must be a fouler object than the dead semblance
of a man. The corse is to be got rid of—crammed in a hole, in good
season, to manure the soil, and there an end. Now, feed the poor
man, give him for one night a shelter from the elements, and, so
troublesome is the wretchedness, it must be fed and housed again.
He is a continual fetor, a blotch in the nostrils and eyes of the well-
to-do ; respectability holds the nose at him, and to escape the hideous
spectacle, “shuts the shop.” Here is Ogle-square serenely com-
placent in a sense of worldly comforts; a rate-paying, church-going
Square ; a Square, for form sake at least. owning herself “a miserable
sinner,” suddenly flustered, outraged, contaminated, by a foul Laza-
retto of a wretch, a-Refuge for the Destitute What has Ogle-
square to do with destitution She wants nothing. Look in her
face; she is well fed, sleek and flourishing. Butcher and baker make
their daily calls upon her—the milkman's voice is melodious in her
areas, and the pot-boy salutes her thrice a-day. And her comforts
are to be reflected upon, insulted by making her see the wretched-
ness of others . She cannot even enjoy a furtive sop in the pan
without beholding, what she rightly considers to be, the impudence
of hungry looks, staring down at her. Even her handsome gown,
tippet and shawl, are sneered at—oh, there is no mistaking the
gesture—by that grim, gaunt woman, with little more than half a
petticoat.
There are many reasons why Ogle-square should clamour for a
redress of this wrong. Nay, the very noses of Ogle-square demand it.
We will explain ourselves.
RABELA1s has shown that a pug or a straight nose depends upon
the nurse who suckles the future man or woman. In one case it
will be turned-up by opposing hardness; in the other, meeting no
resisting bosom, it will grow at its own sweet will. Now, if anything
can spoil the nose of the adult animal, it is a compelled contempla-
tion of want and destitution. Very respectable reader, is it not
truly so A pauper, foul and in rags, crawls towards you. Do you
not immediately feel your nose curl up like the tail of a flounder 1
The fact is, your blood is startled by the wretchedness, and gives a
quick action to certain nerves in your heart (we have found them
out, though Sir CHARLEs BELL missed them,) which communicate
with your nose. Hence, the man who most turns up his nose at his
fellow's misery, may be said most to feel it.
Well, we put it to common justice, whether the noses of any neigh-
bourhood are to be doomed to constant deformity—to an enduring
turn-up—by having a Refuge for the Houseless thrust under them?
Let the Institution complained of remain where it is, and the noses
of Ogle-square will curl over the foreheads of its men and women.
We submit, that no class of our fellow-subjects should be submitted
to the infliction of this evil. Hence, Duke of Poat LAND, the Refuge
must be put down—the poor must be got rid of. But how ! Remove
the nuisance, and you only remove the place of complaint. Never-
theless, the poor—the living, whining, starving nuisance, must be got
rid of; and, without fee or reward, we will tell how.
The poor are the nuisance of the earth; there is no nation in
which they do not abound; there are no respectable people what-
ever—from the respectable Hottentot, who can afford to girdle him-
self with sheep's intestines, to the pauper Hottentot ungirdled—who
would not rid themselves of the foul blot. In this way it may be
done. It is in vain to change the locality of wretchedness—the
iniquity remains. Hence, let all potentates and princes combine,
and, if necessary, by force of arms, drive their herds of poor toge-
y ther. Then, when all the poor and wretched of the earth are in one
crowd, let them be relentlessly driven and driven until they are
driven to the world's end. When there, let them be—pitched over.

question of-Who writes GEoRGE Robins's

duced, and plausibly supported. Mr. Rob ERT
Montgom ERY was, for some time, believed by

thought we recognised the style of Luther dig-
nifying invitations to purchase house and land.
Next, Mr. GRANT, the author of the Great
Metropolis, was named ; and we are pretty sure
that we once detected him in a sale at Horsleydown. However,
there can be now no doubt that Lord Brough AM at present holds
the auctioneer's quill; a pleasing fact (as further illustrative of his
wondrous versatility), manifested in the subjoined. Mr. Robins
wishes to sell a lump of agricultural property, and thus the ex-
Chancellor writes of that “settled question ” the Corn Laws :-
“The adjustment of the great point at issue has arrived at a great triumphant result.
It is at length discovered that, in the exceedingly intricate task which required all the
mind, the perspicacity, and depth of intellect possessed by our first Minister in
organising his salutary alteration in the Corn Laws, he has dealt out a measure of
strict and impartial justice, no less to the manufacturing than the agricultural interest.”
The style alone would betray Lord BRough AM ; but when his
present praise of Sir RoRERT PEEL is taken in connection with his
many years' abuse, no doubt whatever can exist of the authorship.

“GENTLEMEN JEWS.”
It is a cry, common as the cry of mackarel, that we
are fast approaching social destruction. All things,
great and small, show it. The globe that we inhabit
suffered a slight crack on Catholic Emancipation—
another crack on the passing of the Reform Bill ; and
if it do not go clean in half on the abolition of the
Corn Laws, why Colonel Sibthorp is no conjuror.
What, however, are we to expect, when we find all
our pet prejudices taken from us The truth is, we
then cease to be a people worth saving. Good, strong, .
stringent prejudices are intended to hold society to-
gether, even as iron hoops bind the staves of a cask.
The world was much wiser and better when King
John drew bills upon the teeth of a Jew, and
throughout the land the Israelite was a thing of
abomination. We have long since ceased to look for
gold in the jaws of the Hebrew ; and, in the weak-
ness of our benevolence, have given the creature
liberties and privileges innumerable. Nevertheless,
we put it to The Morning Post, whether, with all
our liberality, it is not a gross affront to every respect-
able person of the Christian persuasion to call a Jew
—“a gentleman t” Yet do we find it reported of
Mr. Thomas, barrister, that a few days since he
averred, that “gentlemen Jews were now sworn in
Westminster Hall like other persons,” that is, with
their hats off
At one time there was a very wholesome belief that
the Jewish anatomy betrayed itself by an unpleasant
odour inherent in it. This belief is still strong in the
Morning Pest, for, in one of its late leaders, dictated
at the Russian Embassy, it spoke in its own peculiar
vein of satire, of “those odoriferous people, the Jews.”
Sir Thomas BRowne, among his other vagaries,
touches upon the prejudice. “For,” he says, “unto
converted Jews, who are of the same seed, no man
imputeth this unsavoury odour; as though, aromatised
by their concersion, they lost their scent with their
religion, and smelt no longer than they savoured of
the Jew l’’
We have long been silent — indignantly silent—
hearing the verbal changes rung upon, whilom, the
abominable name of Jew. From “accursed dogs,”
they have risen to “individuals of the Jewish per-
suasion,” “persons of the Hebrew faith,” and so on.
But to call a Jew a “gentleman,” oh, Mr. Ralph
Thomas! we hand you over to the virtuously orthodox
indignation of the Morning Post. May you for ever
be cheated by the Hebrew in oranges, and buy for
ever of the tribe “black-lead pencils,” innocent of
lead :

THE KING OF THE CANNIBAL ISLANDS.
Oh I have you heard the news of late,
About a mighty King so great 1–
If you have not, 'tis in my pate,
The King of the Cannibal Islands.
He was so tall, near six feet six,
He had a head like Mister Nick's,
His palace was like Dirty Dick's,
'Twas built of mud for want of bricks,
And his name was Poonoowingkeewang,
Flibeedee flobeedee, buskeebang,
And a lot of Indians swore they'd hang

This mighty King had in one hut
Seventy wives as black as soot,
And thirty of a double smut,
The King of the Cannibal Islands.-
So just one hundred wives he had,
Upon my word it was too bad,
For his smutty dears soon drove him mad :
There was Hungkee Mungkee short and tall,
With Tuzzee Muzzee and Keeko Poll,
And some of them swore they would have all
The King of the Cannibal Islands.
One day this King invited most
Of all his subjects to a roast,
For half his wives gave up the ghost,
The King of the Cannibal Islands.
Of fifty wives he was bereſt,
And so he had but fifty left,
He said with them he would make shift,
So for a gorge all set off swift;
The fifty dead ones were roasted soon,
And all demolish'd before the noon,
And a lot of chiefs vowed to have soon
The King of the Cannibal Islands.
When they had done, and bones pick'd clean,
They all began to dance I ween,
The fifty wives slipp'd out unseen
From the King of the Cannibal Islands.
He turning round, soon miss'd them all,
So for his wives began to bawl,
But not one answered to his call,
He sprung out through the muddy wall;
Then into the woods he went with grief,
And found each queen along with a chief,
He swore he'd Macadamize every thief,
The King of the Cannibal Islands.
He sent for all his guards with knives,
• To put an end to all their lives,
The fifty chiefs and fifty wives

Carving their heads off one by one,
And the King he laugh'd to see the fun,
Then jump'd into bed when all was done;
And every night when he's asleep,
His headless wives and chiefs all creep,
And roll upon him in a heap,

MOVEMENTS OF THE OJIBBEWAYS.
These interesting individuals visited the brewhouse of Messrs. Truman, Hanbury, and
Buxton, upon which occasion they drank off the contents of the largest vat, and then—to
be thoroughly convinced there was no more—got into it, and had a dance at the bottom of it.
The rapid disappearance of the beer caused the oldest of Messrs. Truman's draymen to observe
that he had never before seen “porter's work done" with such extraordinary expedition.
The Ojibbeways, not content with a few pots, actually cut their initials into the vat itself, and
the dance at the bottom was, we believe, an Ojibbeway reel of a very extraordinary character.
These very remarkable persons have received various presents, among which are a number
of Tweedish wrappers, ºf: few blankets; but they walk about in the blankets, and keep the
Tweedish wrappers as curiosities. A quantity of tartan plaid, presented by Her Majesty,
has been made into pinafores for the elder warriors, and instead of the buffalo skins, which
are kept for every-day wear, they each of them sport on Sundays a rope door-mat.

80 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S REVIEW OF BOOKS.
Ma. Roebuck's speeches AT THE BAR, BEFoRE AND SINCE HIs ELEvation
to the RANK of QUEEN’s counsel.
THE Bar of England has long been distinguished for its eloquence,
and the custom of publishing a collection of speeches is a common
one with popular advocates. Mr. Roebuck's elevation to a silk gown
has caused considerable curiosity to be felt as to what he has done
in his profession, and has led to the publication of his speeches at
the Bar in a pamphlet of sixteen pages, two of which are occupied
by the title, two more by the fly-leaf, four by an introduction, six by
a preface, and the speeches themselves occupy the remainder of the
space which is devoted to them. It is not for us to criticise these
splendid specimens of ratiocination mingled with law, in which the
broth of research is seasoned with the pepper of eloquence. We
therefore give one of the speeches entire—the collection consists of
no less than two—in order that the reader may himself judge of the
merit of the production.
The speech we are about to quote was made in the presence of the
writer of this notice, who never can forget the impression which it
created on a mind then fresh in all the buoyancy of hope, and redo-
lent with that respect for genius, which time, alas ! mows down like a
scythe among the buttercups. But we are forgetting the speech,
which we print, word for word, as it was delivered :—
“May it please your Lordships,
“In a case of DoE on
the demise of Roe against SMITH,
I am instructed to move for
a rule, which I think your

Lordships, when you have heard all I have to say, will not refuse
to me.
[Denman, C. J.-‘That depends upon circumstances, Mr. Roe-
buck.”]
My Lord, we are all of us, I know, the creatures of circumstances;
and, as the poet,_
[Williams, J-" Pray, sir, don’t tell us anything about the poet
unless he is a party to the rule.”]
Your Lordship is right. You have brought me back from those
realms, where fancy, like the Lybian bird—
[Patteson, J.-"We can’t notice the Lybian bird, unless he has
been served with a copy of the pleadings. Pray, sir, let us know
what you are going to move for "]

for that rule—
[Denman, C. J.-"You can have it, sir; and, indeed, you might
have handed that motion in.”]
Indeed, my Lord 1 Then I shall know what to do another time.”
Such was the peroration of the speech of Mr. Roebuck; and as he
gave out the words, “I shall know what to do another time,” he
looked like a lion whose mane had been ignobly pulled, and who was
smarting under it. The “other time” has not yet come; but when
it does, we have no doubt Mr. Roebuck will be amply prepared
for it.

POWERTY AND SIBTHORP ON RAILWAYS.
MR. Roebuck has called the attention of Parliament to the conduct of
the Lords of the Great Western Railway, complaining that the poor who
travel by the third-class trains are exposed to the inclemency of the
weather; and that, moreover, they are made to pass twenty-four hours
on the rail in a journey performed by first-class trains in six. Mr. Rok-
Buck very absurdly called this a hardship. ... What would the man have
Make poverty at all comfortable, and you divest it of its ignominy. And
as for the twenty-four hours—why, considering that so many thousand
of the poor have no use whatever for time, is it not especially kind in the
Great Western people so to occupy them. Mr. Roebuck thought that
the House should interfere to obtain some decent accommodation for

of the sacred rights of property, begged to state that he thought the rail-
way directors should be allowed to drive what bargain they chose with
the poor and helpless.
Colonel Sibthoºp rose—(when Parliament is without its Sibthorp, may

he abominated all railroads soever. They had ruined innkeepers and
posting-masters. Nevertheless, SIBTHoRP showed himself a man of im.
perfect sympathies, for he had no word for chambermaids and boots.
The sincere hatred of SIBThorp for the rail we respect, and doubt not
that he would at any time, to vindicate his disgust of such rapid transit,
consent to travel from London to York by the slowest waggon.

LIVES OF REMARKABLE MEN.
THE PASSENGER IN WIMBUSH's OMNIBUS.
ooking into the life of this extraordinary individual, we
find that his career presents but few points for the
biographer, his transit in Wimbush's omnibus from Bel-
grave-square to the Bank being the most remarkable
passage in his history. There is no doubt that a strong
desire for solitude was the motive which induced him
to seek the seclusion of this sombre vehicle ; for it is in
Wimbush's omnibus that the hermit might feel secure
from the chance of being dis-
turbed by the presence of another
human being. It is in the wild
recesses of the unfrequented
cushions of this gloomy abode–
this dreary waste of velveteen
and plate glass, that the dreamer
may throw himself back with a
consciousness-
“That oh! if there's peace to be found in the world,
The heart that is lonely might seek for it.”
in the omnibus of Wimbush. Here he may sing with confidence the fol-
lowing ballad —
Meet me with Wimbush alone,
I’m sure there’ll be no one but us,
For I found myself always alone
When I’ve got into Wimbush's bus.
Remember, be sure and be there,
For though dearly my money I prize,
I care not at all for the fare,
If with you it a tête-à-téte buys.
smiling at the blocking up of London
Shillibeer may do for the gay,
The heartless, the thoughtless, the free;
But there's something in Wimbush's way,
That is sweeter to you and to me.
Then meet me by daylight alone.
Yes, in Wimbush's bus all alone.
Me-e-e-time alonel
In Wi-i-i-imbush's omni-i-i-bus,
All a-a-a-a-a-a-lo-o-o-o-nell
To return, however, to the very remarkable character whose biography
is the subject of this article. His reasons for entering the omnibus of
Wimbush may be guessed at, but never can be ascertained; for the aim
or purpose of such a rare and almost unprecedented act must always
remain “a deep and solemn mystery.” It may have been a love of seclu-
sion; it may have been a desire to be thought eccentric, and to be able to
say what hardly a man living can say, “I have been a passenger by Wim-
bush's omnibus.” Such is the vile desolation of the vehicle, that the con-
ductor never thinks of initing any one to enter by any of those vigorous
exclamations of “C’ty, B'nk,” which distinguish the less retiring cads of
the more social vehicles. Such is the sauntering pace of the “splendid
cattle” employed in dragging the genteel, but desolate bus, that it is in
contemplation to write over the door the words of the Italian poet
“Voi che intrate,
Ognisperanza lasciate;”
which may be freely rendered thus:—
All ye who enter, may at once despair,
(If, for the Bank)—of ever getting there.
We now close our biography of this remarkable character. We cannot
give any description of his appearance ; but we should say that some idea
might be formed of him, from the figure of Patience on the monument,
ridge.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FORCE OF TWO-PENCE. |
Or the thousands of unreflecting folk who daily pass Saint Paul's
Church, we doubt if there be a single individual who attributes
the decent conservation of that sacred edifice to the proper cause.
No man suspects that it is kept hallowed and respectable by-
Two-pence 1 Yet so it is : the fact is written in the golden letters of
a Parliamentary return, and who, save the illiterate and stone-blind,
shall dare to doubt it ! We quote the document, called for by the
motion of Mr. HumE, “to inquire into the state of the national
edifices,” &c :-
“objections have at various times been made to the payment of the fee of 2d. for
admission into St. Paul's; but whenever the subject has been considered the continuance
of this small payment has been determined to be indispensably necessary for preventing
the serious epils which would assuredly attend the free and unrestrained admission of
a London population into a sacred edifice situated in the heart of the city, and passed
every day by many thousands of people, for which salutary purpose [what purpose 2 to
BE passed 7] it was established.”
Great is the force of Two-pence : When Sir CHR1stoph En WREN
accomplished his mighty work, he little thought that the whole
beauty and utility of his labour depended upon—Two-pence When
the ball and the cross were elevated to their places, the Cathedral
was still unfinished. It was the admission fee to the fabric that con-
summated the work. All would have been naught but for—Two-
pence 1
To those not penniless it may be known that WR EN has us
words, Si monumentum quaris, circumspice t We submit that the
heathen Latin be removed, and in its place be written the short
Saxon significance—
“Serious evils,” are warded from St. Paul's by Two-pence 1 We
bow to the truth, and in our imagination see a luring figure
of Britannia from the obverse of a penny-piece, seated at each
side of the Cathedral doors. She not only rules the waves, but,
by the force of copper, keeps mannerly a “London population.”
The church is a “sacred edifice,” but, implies the report, its sacred-
ness depends upon the halfpence taken at its vomitoria. Abolish
the Two-pence, and its holiness departs. It has been rightly said that
pecunia non olet—money has no smell. This was a say of the heathen
age. Now Christian orthodoxy in the case of St. Paul's proves that
the odour of sanctity especially resides in Two-pence
It is very well for Mr. HUME and such revolutionists to question
the doings of St. Paul's folk; but, sure we are, not without painful
consideration of its social benefit do they stickle for their two-pence.
Deep and divers are its advantages. Let us, in justice to the reve-
rend body, consider them :—
In the first place, men have another lesson added to the twenty
thousand daily taught them of the use of two-pence—of the peculiar
TWO - P E N C E .
privileges it confers upon the holder. He, who wants the two-pence,
is not a proper person to enter St. Paul's Church. His mental per-
ceptions, not quickened by copper, can in no way be elevated by the
contemplation of a Cathedral. What is the harmony of architecture
to him who cannot chink his penny-pieces? What the solemn appeal
to the fulness of imagination when the pocket is empty Can there
be any doubt of the profane conduct of the penniless visitor? Would
he not, with stick of charcoal, write irreverent words upon the monu-
ments; and may be, to show his contempt of learning in a high
churchman, decorate the statue of Doctor Johnson with a black
moustache And now, too, would he jump, and dance, and shout,
even as one of the profane crowd, who, when “two-pence more” is
given, clamour at an uplifted donkey ! This, and worse, would come
of the “unrestrained admission of a London population into a sacred
edifice.” Whereas, the two-pence, like a refining spirit cast into a
boiling vat, precipitates the dregs. And then two-pence, as the reve-
rend gentlemen truly observe, is such a “small payment " He or she
must, indeed, be a forlorn wretch, who lacks the sum. When shirts
are made at three-halfpence each, who, but the most idle and irre-
ligious, can want two-pence 1
We have painted, feebly enough, the spiritual destitution of the
copperless intruder in the sanctuary of the Church. Turn we to that
refreshing sight, the excellent person who, like a Christian and a
—A-
peaceable citizen, pays, even as at the sixpenny gallery of a play-
house, his two-pence at the door.
How different the spectacle 1 The man, to our imagination, is exter
nally writ all over with the word Two-pence. It gives him a property
air; a seemliness of carriage; a decorousness of manner that shows
the person of coppers. Reflecting that he is only admitted into the
church through the fee he has paid, it is difficult—most difficult for
him—to divorce his thoughts from two-pence. It is not his fault if the
whole fabric appear to him studded with penny-pieces. Nay,
to his confused vision the very pulpit-cloth may glitter with them.
He learns that he is only where he is by the virtue of his pence, and
the sense of his whereabout is elevated accordingly. Wrapt, uplifted
by the sublimity of the place, what a very wholesome contempt has
he of the outside wretch who has not two-pence!
It is, indeed, a “small payment.” Why, a travelling show-van in
the church-yard may at that moment—if, by the way, such sights are
permissible in the city—offer only two or three albinos, a giantess,
and a spotted boy for a penny; whereas the reverend show-folks
of St. Paul's offer the body of the Cathedral, with Nelson's tomb and
fifty other monuments, for only double the sum. Those who would
ascend to the whispering-gallery must of course pay more. This is
|but just. Even at Madame Tussaud's, the Chamber of Horrors is an
additional sixpence.
Who can doubt but, that were the two-pence removed, the Church
would become a place of rendezvous for the lowest of a London
population tº And, again, when we reflect upon the existing difficulty
of engaging some additional dozen vergers to keep an eye upon the
profane people admitted gratis, the wisdom associated with the
demand of two-pence is most triumphant.
Besides, we have only to pause and think of the spoliation
committed in the British Museum, and all from the “unrestrained
admission of a London population.” At this moment stands
not one of the giraffes stript of a yard of his skin, furtively cut off
by an old woman for a tippet f Was not the torso of Theseus clan-
destinely removed to an out-house at Hackney Have not all the
mummies, one by one, been carried off the premises *
What, then, with no money-taker at the door, could happen to
St. Paul's Therefore we say to the reverend gentlemen, “Read
your Bibles, and, as long as you can, take your two-pence 1 "
“TO THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE.”
In the Times of the 7th instant there was the subjoined Adver-
| tisement —
To the BROTHERS CHEERYBLE, or any who have Hearts like
theirs.-A clergyman, who will gladly communicate his name and address, desires
to introduce the CASE of a GENTLEMAN, equal at least to Nickleby in birth, worthy,
bke him, for refinement of character, even of the best descent, like hion of spotless in-
tegrity, and powerfully beloved by friends who cannot help him, but no longer tº ke
Nickleby sustained by the warm buoyancy of youthful blood. The widowed father of
oung children, he i. spent his all in the struggles of an unsuccessful but honourable
5usiness, and has now for 18 months been vainly seeking some stipendiary employment.
To all who have ever known him he can refer for commendation. Being well versed in
accounts, though possessed of education, talents, and experience, which would render
him invaluable as a private secretary, he would accept with gratitude even a clerk’s stoos
and daily bread. Any communication addressed to the Rev. B C, post-office, Cambridge,
will procure full particulars, ample references, and the introduction of the party, who is
now in town, and ignorant of this attempt to serve him.
Thus it is, ink-drops beget flesh and blood. Men, women, and
children, as vital as the offspring of Adam, trickle down the goose-
quilt of genius, and become living, breathing presences in the world.
Their goodness, like Heaven's air, is a thing for ever ; we hug them
to our hearts, creatures of thew and muscle. In the dreariest as in
the pleasantest seasons, by the sweet conjuration of our thoughts
they are with us—they are our friends inalienable by disappointment
or wrong; our fast co-mates to the grave. Wondrous, enviable
privilege of genius, that out of so many ink-drops can create im-
mortal beings, ministrant of pleasure and goodness—can people the
roughest, darkest bye-ways of the world with cheerful, hopeful
things of life, and quicken and ennoble the spent, desponding spirit
of man with the true and beautiful ?
Here is an invocation to charity made in the name of the Brothers
Cheeryble—mere shadows; spectres of the press ; things begotten
of an ink-bottle. Such, indeed, may the foolish think thein ; yet
has the “Rev. B.C., post-office, Cambridge,” truer, wiser knowledge
of the brethren. He knows them to be vitally endowed by the
power of genius—as such, he knows them to be still moving about
the world, shaking ten thousand hands that welcome theim ; and so,
conjuring by the benignity of their fine natures, he asks relief for his
Nickleby. May his warm, ingenuous spirit find it !

A POLISHED POEM.
The intrinsic excellence of the Old English Ballads, in spite of the
ruggedness of their language and their metrical irregularities, has long
been acknowledged and appreciated. Replete with pathos, with senti-
ment, and with the other elements of poetic beauty, shrouded in uncouth
phraseology, they may be said to be comparable to loveliness in the garb
of rusticity, or to the gem of Golconda in the rough. The Modern
English Ballads have been less fortunate. Couched in terms of a verna-
cular and idiomatic, not to say vulgar character, they have been excluded
from the category of literature, and have remained in the predicament of
rubbish. Many of them yet contain thoughts that breathe, which
require only to be clothed in words that burn, to vindicate their claims to
the title of Poetry. Let us hope that some competent artist will, ere long,
be found to invest such conceptions in their proper habiliments. We are
not that artist, we know ; but still we will venture an attempt in the line
which we have chalked out for him. To the boudoirs whereunto Punch
has the privilege of the entrée, he begs to introduce one of those Ballads,
in a dress which, he hopes, will render it presentable. Its simplicity, its
truthfulness, and, above all, its high moral, have recommended it to him
for selection. It is well-known to the million ; of whose singing, indeed,
it forms a part. Perhaps it will be recognised; perhaps not.

Mark me, I'd try persuasion's art,
For cruelty offends my heart:
Had all resembled me, I ween,
Martin, thy law had needless been
Of speechless brutes from blows to screen.
The poor head;
For had I an ass averse to speed
I ne'er would strike him ; no indeed .
I'd give him hay, and cry, “Proceed.”
And “Go on, Edward . "
Why speak I, thus? This very morn,
I saw that cruel William Burn,
Whilst crying “Greens !" upon his course,
Assail his ass with all his force;
He smote him o'er the head and thighs,
Till tears bedimm'd the creature's eyes |
Oh! 'twas too much. My blood 'gan rise,
And I exclaim'd,
“Had I an” &c.
Burn turn’d and cried, with scornful eye,
“Perchance thou'rt one of Martin's fry,
And seek'st occasion base to take,
The vile informer's gain to make.”
Word of denial though I spoke,
Full on my brow his fury broke,
And thus, while I return'd the stroke,.
I exclaim’d,
“Had I an” &c.
To us, infringing thus the peace,
Approach'd its guardians—the police;
And, like inevitable Fate,
Bore us to where stern Justice sate:
Her minister the tale I told ;
And to support my word, made bold
To crave he would the ass behold:
“For,” I declared,
“Had I an” &c.
They call'd the creature into court,
Where, sooth to say, he made some sport,
With ears erect, and parted jaws,
As though he strove to plead his cause:
I gain'd the palm of feelings kind;
The ass was righted ; William fined.
For Justice, one with me in mind,
Exclaim’d, by her Minister,
“Had I an” &c.
Cried William to his Judge, “'Tis hard
(Think not the fine that I regard),
But things have reach'd a goodly pass—
One may not beat a stubborn ass!”
Nought spoke the Judge, but closed his book;
So William thence the creature took,
Eyeing me—ah ! with what a look,
As gently whispering in his ear, I said,
“William, had I an,” &c.
From the above humble attempt a useful hint will be derivable by a
noble Lord who shines so peculiarly in paraphrase.
PANIC IN THE ARMY.
“WINchest ER.—The Fusilier Guards, stationed in this city, on Sunday last were
attending divine service in the lobby of the county hall, when a door leading from the
vaults under the Crown Court suddenly opened with a violence that prostrated a tall
sergeant near it, and a form covered with dust and soot, stood before them bellowing,
as well as fright and ashes would allow him, “Cut for your lives!”, “Cut for your lives
At these appalling words, Sauve qui peut became the order of the day, and a most
tremendous, rush was made to the only outlet to the place. All distinctions of rank
and subordination were for the time lost. Fortunately, all gained the outside of the
building without loss of life or limb, the only damage sustained being some few bruises
and torn regimentals. It appeared the hubbub was caused by some trifling derangement
of the hot-water apparatus that warms the building.”–Hampshire Independent.
We have heard of the battle of Hastings, and the retreat from Mos-
cow, but nothing in history ever equalled the recent flight of the
Fusiliers at Winchester. The men, under the command of their captain,
were attending divine service, and were, of course, wholly unarmed. In
this utterly defenceless and truly perilous position, they were suddenly
“surprised" by the opening of a door, and an individual in the garb of a
chimney-sweep rushed amongst them, exclaiming, “Cut for your lives 1”
a command they instantly obeyed—for the gallant fellows felt, no doubt,
how valuable, in case of war, their lives might become to their country.
men. If England should ever be engaged in hostilities, and it should be
|important to effect a retreat, it is to be hoped that the Fusiliers will be
selected to lead the way, if not to glory and renown, at least to security.
If other regiments have added to the lustre of British arms, the reputa-
|tion of British legs must rest on the gallant fellows who led the move-
ment the other day at Winchester. We hear that a new stand of colours
has been ordered for the valiant Fusiliers; the device upon which will be
a sweep couchant, with the motto—“Cut it.”
JUVENILE COURT CIRCULAR.
We have always regarded it as a singular omission on the part of
the Court newsman, that he makes a point of saying nothing whatever
of the movements of the junior branches of the Royal Family. By a
judicious system of bribery, added to an adroitness only to be equalled
by the Boy Jones, “the Maniac,” and other uninvited guests at
Buckingham Palace, we have succeeded in introducing a reporter of
our own, who will put us in possession of the news, the doings, and
the small-talk, of the Royal Nursery; which we proceed to lay before
our readers, under the head of
NURSERY COURT CLRCULAR.
The Princess Royal took a short skip with the rope, and subse-
guently swung for half an hour, attended—or held on to the swing—
by the Dowager Lady Littleton.
His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales played for some minutes
a number of variations on the glass harmonicon. His Royal Highness
was subsequently taken, for change of scene—and change of pinafore
—to the Nursery dressing-room.
The Princess Royal honoured a hoop with a short trundle during
the afternoon.
The Royal Infants yawned for a few minutes in the evening; and
a representation having been made as to the approach of the Dust-
men, the Princess Royal left for Beds by the Marrowbone stage, and
was soon followed by her brother and sister.
Improvement in Lithography.
A copper-plars engraver, at Rome, has discovered a method of fixing
on stone the images obtained by the Daguerreotype. If this can be done
r: stone, it will really be possible to make an impression upon the heart
of a Poor-law Commissioner.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LORD LYNDHURST’s CHARGE TO THE Pyx JURY.
[From our own Reporter.]
A CoMMITTEE of the Goldsmiths' Company, appointed to try the coinage,
assembled at the Privy Council Chamber, when the Lord Chancellor
addressed them nearly as follows:–
“Gentlemen, You are assembled here to-day to try the value of the
coinage; and, as the coal merchant is said to have remarked that “Coals
is coals,’ it will be for you to say if money is really money.
“Gentlemen, there is no pleasure in life without some alloy, and money,
which is one of the greatest of earthly delights, has also its alloy; but
you will have to take care there is not too much of it. Formerly, every
gold watch weighed so many carats, from which it became usual to call a
wilver watch a turnip ; but this will not, at present, form a branch of
5 our inquiry. Troy weight, gentlemen, is derived from the heavy respon-
sibility the Trojans were under to their creditors. The Romans were in
the habit of tossing up their coins in the presence of the legions, and if a
piece of money went higher than the tip of the ensign's flag, it was pro-
nounced to be above the standard. You, gentlemen, will not be required
to do this. It will be sufficient if you ring the money on the mahogany
dining-table that you will find prepared for you.
“The early Italians used cattle instead of coin, and a person would some-
times send for change for a thousand pound bullock, when he would
receive twenty fifty-pound sheep, or perhaps, if he wanted very small
change, there would be a few lambs amongst them. The inconvenience
of keeping a flock of sheep at one's banker's, or paying in a short-
horned heifer to one's private account, led to the introduction of bullion.
“To return, however, gentlemen, to the duty that will devolve upon
yourselves. You will be called upon to examine into the unhealthy custom
of sweating sovereigns; and, with regard to this point, will do well to
recollect that Charles the First was, perhaps, the earliest sovereign who
was sweated to such an extent that his immediate successor, Charles the
Second, became one of the lightest sovereigns ever known in this country.
“With these remarks, gentlemen, I leave you to the discharge of your
important duties. There are weights and scales in the next room ; and
while British honesty holds the beam, I am sure that British wealth can
never suffer; for it is the boast of our blessed nation, that the merchant
may hold his head as high as the noble—(aside) if his washerwoman has
put sufficient starch in his shirt-collar.” The learned lord's speech was
so much applauded when he arrived at the beautiful little figure of the
merchant and the noble, that the concluding words, spoken aside, were
not audible.
The foreman of the Pyx jury, in the enthusiasm of the moment, asked
the whole of the Privy Council to a banquet, to be given the same evening
in the Hall of the Goldsmiths’ Company.
The Lord Chancellor, in the name of the Privy Council, observed, that
they were all indisposed, and all their medical attendants had said, that
by all means they must all keep quiet, and therefore could not accept the
Pyx jury's polite invitation. The jury then amused themselves by tossing
up, weighing, breathing upon, biting, and otherwise experimentalising
with the coin of the realm, which they declared to be honest and satis-
factory.
PUNCH*S PATENT MEDICINES.
UNch respectfully begs to offer the following Patent
Medicines for the patronage of the British Public :—
Punch's KAlopoietic SterNUTAtory, or BEAUTI-
fying SNuff.-There is, perhaps, no feature of the
“human face divine” of more importance as an
element in personal beauty than the Nose. It has long
been observed that the Snuffs in common use exert a
most prejudicial influence on this organ; producing
an unseemly dilatation of the nostrils, and not unfre-
quently an alteration of hue. The KAlopoietic
SterNutatory, so far from being chargeable with
these disadvantages, possesses the remarkable pro-
perty of changing the Shape and Colour of the Nose
for the better, converting, after a few weeks' employ-
ment, the most decided Snub into the most perfect
Aquiline; and effectually removing all Warts, Pimples,
Tuberosities, and Bristles from its extremity.
To those suffering from the effects of ardent spirits on this feature, the
Beautifying SNuff is confidently recommended : one Box will remove
the most inveterate alcoholic efflorescences. This Cosmetic Mixture
will prove a real blessing to the fair sex in dispelling that nasal erubes-
cence which is one of the greatest miseries of winter, and which One
Pinch will infallibly transfer to the cheek in ten minutes. It may be taken
to excess without the slightest injury to the voice. In colour it is of a beau-
tiful French White, and exhales a most delicious Fragrance. Its effects
on the Nervous System are most beneficial ; it producing a gentle but
permanent Exhilaration of Spirits, and a lively and facetious Flow of
ideas. To such of the Nobility as may wish to possess a Nose worthy of
their Birth and Station; and to those of the Public in general, who are
anxious for an Aristocratic Profile, this snuff will be found inestimable.
In tin packages, at 5s. and 2s. 6d. each.
Punch's METAMAphoseoN, or TRANsfor MAtoRY EYE WATER.—This
wonderful Discovery, for changing Eyes of an indifferent colourt to
Blue, Hazel, or Black, is the result of a long series of Experiments
and Researches in Ophthalmology. It is a fluid of limpid appearance, and
not distinguishable by the senses from Pump WATER ; but, by the aid of
Homoeopathic Chemistry, it has been infinitesimally imbued with a pecu-
liar substance, endowed with the astonishing power of so acting on the
Iris as entirely to change its colour. According to the number and mode
of the applications, it converts the natural tint of the EYE to Blue,
HAzel, or Jet Black; and is warranted to extirpate the smallest con-
ceivable portion of GREEN IN the EYE. It likewise imparts to the
Apparatus of Vision a peculiar BRilliancy and LusrRE, on which account
it will be of the greatest service to the Lover ; and no one about to enter
on a career of courtship ought to be without a bottle of it. It so far
improves the dullest sight as entirely to supersede Spectacles, and cor-
rects the most confirmed squint, thus rendering the painful operation for
Strabismus unnecessary. In bottles at 10s. 6d. and 5s. each ; or 21.2s.
for a case containing five bottles.
Punch's Figure Pills.-These extraordinary Pills, by an occult
operation on the formative principle of the Human Body, effect an ame-
lioration of the figure, remedying emaciation, reducing corpulence, and
exalting DeFormity itself into the Penfection of the IDEAL MARBLE,
whereby all Stays, Bandages, Screws, and other Mechanical Contrivances,
so prejudicial to Health and Longevity, may be dispensed with. They

Shocking Loss of Property.
The Pennsylvanian Inquirer of the 15th ult, gives a terrible account of
the wreck of the Shepherdess steamer. It pathetically says, “One man
lost 3,000 dollars in money, and another thirty negroes 1 " We trust that
the latter calamity will touch the benevolent bosoms of the Americans,
and that no time will be lost in subscribing for the poor man at least
thirty blacks. It is bad enough to lose mere dollars, but to see one's
black human flesh go to the bottom of a river, would wring tears from a
heart of rock.
Heraldry.
A GENERAL error seems to prevail, that the Dukedom of Jenkins is
entirely a modern creation. This we have authority from the College of
Arms to contradict; the illustrious individual who now enjoys the title
having incontestably established his right to a dormant peerage. For
those curious in heraldry we may add, that his genealogical tree is
discovered by the Kings of Arms to have been the “Boot-tree.”

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.-OF MASTER AND SERVANT.
Aving commented on the people in their
public relations, we now come to private
relations, including Master and Servant,
Husband and Wife, which, by the bye, is a
relation something like that of master and
servant, for the wife is often a slave to the
husband,-Parent and Child, and Guardian
and Ward—the latter being a sort of rela-
tionship which is seen upon the stage,
where a choleric old man with a stick is
always thwarting the affections of a young
lady in white muslin.
We shall begin with Master and Servant
—showing how such relationship is created
and destroyed. There is now no such thing
as pure and proper slavery in England; so
that a servant of all-work who says, “Hang
that door-bell,—I am a perfect slave to it,” has recourse to a fiction.
England is so repugnant to slavery, that directly a negro sets his foot on
English ground he is free ; but if he has lost both his legs, he cannot of
course put his foot on British soil, and would remain a slave to circum-
stances. ... A menial servant is so called from the word mania, which sig-
nifies walls, and arises probably from the practice of brushing down
cobwebs from the mania, or walls, with a Turk's-head, or hair-broom.
The old doctrine of a month's wages or a
month's warning is always acted on in London,
except when a servant refuses to obey his
master's orders, when it seems the master may
give the servant kicks—and kick him out— in-
stead of halfpence.
Another species of servants are called Ap-
prentices, from the word apprendre, to learn ;
and thus a barber's apprentice learns to shave
on the faces of poor people, who, in consideration
of their paying nothing, allow themselves to be
[..." on by beginners who have never
ndled the razor.
Next come the Labourers, whose wages were
formerly settled by justices of the peace at ses-
sion, or the sheriff; but now the master settles
the wages, or, if he does not settle, he is a very
shabby fellow for failing in doing so.
Stewards, Porters, and Bailiffs come next ;
but no one would think of having a bailiff as
his servant, unless there were an execution in
the house, and the bailiff were thrust into livery
to save appearances.
A. master may correct his apprentice for
negligence ; and if a grocer's apprentice neglects
to sand the sugar, the master may give him the
cane, for neglecting his business.
A master may maintain or assist his servant
in an action at law; and if one's footman hap-
pens to be a rightful heir in disguise, the master
may lend him the money to go to law against
the wrongful heir, for the purpose of recovering
the property.
A master may assault a man for assaulting
his servant, on the principle, probably, that in
a row, as in everything else, the more the
Inerrier.
“If any person do hire my servant,” says F. N. B. 167, 168—but
whether F. N.B. is a policeman or what, it is impossible to say, for
any person do hire my servant,” says he, “I may have an action for
damages against both the new master and the servant, or either of them.”
This glorious old privilege is rather obsolete, for we do not find the courts
Qſbt ſtºlomen ſºlarket.
The Government broker has been again busy, but with what view we
are unable to say, for we do not pretend to be in the secrets of the Bank
parlour, though we made a violent effort to peep over the blind to see
what was going forward. The Governor seemed to be in the chair (which
was an easy one), and appeared to be occupied in adding to the rest, for
much occupied in trying actions between ladies and gentlemen and their
late menials.
The master is amenable, to a certain extent, for the act of his servant;
and, therefore, if a servant commit a trespass by order of his master—
such as if a gentleman riding by a field were to order his groom to
jump over into it and pull up a turnip—the master, though he did not
eat the whole of the turnip, or any of it, would be liable for the
trespass. If an innkeeper's servant rob a guest, the innkeeper is liable,
on the principle of like master like man; for the law very reasonably
thinks that, if the servant is a thief, the master very likely may be.
If I usually pay my tradesman ready money, I am not liable if he
trusts my servant; but if I do not usually pay him any money at all,
then I am liable to pay the money— when he can get it out of me.
This is on the authority of Noy's Maxims—and a maxim is always sup-
posed to contain the maximum of wisdom.
By an old statute, called “An Act for the better and more careful use
of the Frying-pan,” it is provided that any servant who sets the house on
fire by carelessness shall forfeit 100l., or go to the workhouse, where
they would forfeit so many pounds of flesh by the spareness of the diet;
and this act, savouring too much of the spirit of Shylock, is now seldom
acted on. A master is liable if anything is thrown from the window of a
house; but it has been decided that if a house should be on fire, and a
servant should throw himself on the indulgence of the public by jumping
amongst the crowd, and should hurt any one, the master would not be
liable, for this would not be wilful damage.
If a pea-shooter be discharged from the garret, and the pea enter the
eye of a passenger, the pater-familias, or master of the house, is, in the
eye of the law, answerable for the pea in the eye of the stranger; for it is
a common law right, inherent in every one, to protect his own pupil.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BROUGHAM'S TROUSERS AND THE WOOLSACK.
THE Tweed trousers of Lord BRough AM are now matter of
history. Curious folks have seen in their approximation to black and
white an outward type and shadowing of the inward man: the regu-
larity of the pattern is, we think, fatal to this belief—his Lordship, in
his politics, avoiding everything on the square. Leaving, however, the
fancy of those discoverers who would seek the colour of a great man's
mind in a man's trousers, we have to inform the reader of a curious
circumstance, than which, perhaps, there is nothing more curious in
all Sir KENNETH Digby’s writings on physical sympathy. It is well
known that though Lord BRough AM has no business whatever on the
Woolsack, it is impossible for him to keep off it. Lord LYNDHurst
is, to be sure, its nominal possessor; but unless he be secured to his
seat by cords or straps, he will inevitably some day be edged and
edged by Lord BRough AM on to the floor. Do we blame or sneer at
the ex-Chancellor for this We hope not : we trust we have more
philosophy; and consequently do not visit upon the man what, in
truth, belongs only to the man's trousers.
There is no man upon earth less ambitious than Lord BRough AM.
For this fact we have the very best authority—his own. Did he not
make up his mind to refuse, a second time, the Chancellorship, and
that, too, when his former colleagues had predetermined not to offer
it him Is there, then, any man who less covets the distinction of
place than the philosophic HENRY BRough AM “Why, then,” asks
the reader, “is he continually jumping on the Woolsack?” Que le
diable fait-il dans ce galére 2 “Why, then, does he feel such an evident
itching for his former seat " Alas ! sir, the fault is not in the spirit
of Lord BRough AM, but in his trousers. Strip him of his Tweeds,
and he is the quietest of ex-Chancellors. What, then, it will still be
asked, makes him hop on and off the Woolsack like a blackbird on a
twig The cause has been narrated to us; and in justice to Lord
Bhough AM, suffering as he is from the ignorance of the malignant
and superficial, we do not hesitate to publish it.
It is well known that the fleece of a sheep has in it two or three
sorts of wool; one sort may be set apart for the manufacture of fine
cloth, anether for a coarser texture. Now, it is an indisputable fact,
as proved to us by the best authority, that the self-same fleece which
was made to contribute to Lord Brough AM's Tweed trousers, also
gave its finer portion to the cloth which covers the Woolsack 1 And
thus it is the separated parts of the fleece—according to D1GBY’s
laws of sympathy—are always yearning and striving to get together.
Thus it is that poor Lord Bhough AM, unconscious of the powerful
agency that moves him, is continually getting cheek by jowl with
Lord LYNDHURsr—and, as it were, grinding his nether man into the
Woolsack—whilst its lawful possessor is pushed and pushed by the
innecent, yet possessed intruder, to the very edge of his seat.
We trust that we have satisfactorily explained what we own may
have appeared rude and unseemly conduct on the part of the ex-
Chancellor. And when, in future, his Lordship shall be jumping on
and off the Woolsack, to the wonder and amusement of the House,
let it not be thought that he is incited to possess himself of that sta-
tion by an ambitious brain—by any prompting of the head; certainly
not, but by—quite the reverse.
SUGGESTED
PROSECUTION OF PUNCH FOR CONSPIRACY1
It will be seen, from the Parliamentary Report of Friday, that, on
Thursday evening, Mr. Serjeant Murphy, in the course of a very
clever speech, pointed out Punch as a proper subject for prosecution.
We can only say we shall be very happy to meet the Government” in
any way, or upon any ground, from the Bar of the House of Lords'
down to the court of pie poudre—se called from the necessity of
coming down with the dust—which has been urged by all our oldest
lawyers from More down to something infinitely less—we mean
Roebuck. We are not aware what charge is to be breught against
us, but, with eur usual amiability, we will ourselves furnish the peg
upon which to hang the pros3cution first, and ourselves afterwards,
unless, as Serjeant Murphy suggests, the Ministers know better than
to grapple with us. We cannot be arraigned for attempting to repeal
the Union between England and Ireland, but we have occasion-
ally been charged with conspiracy to split the sides of the United
Kingdom, which would enable the Government to get up a tolerable
case against us. If Sir Robert Peel will only retain us, we will be so
accommodating as to draw our own Indictment; and we subjoin
TF, we have written w Sir R. Peel on the subject—our letter will be found at p. 94)
-- E:
a specimen of a count, which, in consequence of the immense com-
petition in the legal profession, and the alarming sacrifices now being
made by many learned gentlemen—of the interests of their clients—
we shall be happy to put in at a remarkably low figure.
“3323 &lbereas the said Punch, heretofore, to wit, that is to say,
by wit, on the day and year aforesaid, did with force of jokes, bon mots,
jests, jeur d'esprit, satires, squibs, facetia, fun, humour, wit, wisdom,
puns, philosophy, poetry, plates, cuts, and other missiles, make a
tremendous hit, rap, blow, sensation, or other extraordinary effect,
which did dreadfully shake, or set shaking, agitate, or set in agitation,
convulse, or throw into convulsions, the sides, ribs, flanks, or other
lateral extremities of the said United Kingdom; to the great and
imminent danger of the said sides, ribs, flanks, or other lateral extre-
mities, and with the intention. of cracking, splitting, or otherwise
repealing the Union between the said sides, &c., as heretofore, &c.;
to the damage, &c. of &c., to the intent &e. and &c.—Whereof.” &c.
The above is a sample of the counts, for which the charge will be
considerably reduced in the event of the Government taking a quan-
tity. The only difficulty about the matter will be the jury to convict
us, for we shall certainly claim to be tried by our peers, and shall
challenge every juryman who cannot make a joke, or undergo a
searching examination in that great text book of the humorous
constitution—the work of the immortal Miller. Feeling thoroughly
convinced, that to prosecute us would only add, if possible, to our
popularity, we shall be very glad to pay for the indictment as an
advertisement, and will go to the expense of turning the writ into
a posting-bill for the walls of the Metropolis.

HOUSE OF LORDS.
Now ING the public anxiety on this question, the
Duke of Rich Mox D said, that having been pro-
ceeded against for certain penalties incurred by
betting on horse-racing, he should instantly
move for leave to introduce a Bill to put an end
to the actions that had been brought against
him. He (the Duke of Richmond) had no
selfish motive in the course he had adopted.
(Hear, Hear.) Horse-racing was a noble sport,
* and he wished to see the manly pastimes of the
people more generally encouraged. He should
conclude by moving that the Bill for relieving himself and others
from certain penalties be read a first time.
Lord Bnough AM begged to express his concurrence in the noble
sentiments that he had heard fall from the lips of his noble friend.
These qui tam actions were brought against most noble and most
honourable individuals, some of them friends of his own, and he
therefore should cordially support the Bill for putting an end to those
actions immediately. (Hear.) He (Lord Bnough AM) thought he
might be permitted to say, without fear of contradiction either from
his most neble and scientific friend on his right, or his less scientific
but equally noble friend on his left, that the greatness of an empire
consists in the strength of her people, and that no people can be truly
strong, if the manly sports to which they are attached are denied to
them. (Cheers.) He should certainly record his vote in favour of the
Bill for suspending the qui tan actions to which his noble and
honourable friend had been subjected.
The Bill was then read a first time, and the House adjourned.
HORSE-RACING BILL.
Lord Brough AM rose to move the second reading of this Bill
He (Lord Bnough AM), considering the effect of these manly sports on
the British character,-considering that the actions were now going
on, and every day might add to the expense,_considering the great
advantage of encouraging the breed of horses, and the very heavy
penalties to which some most honourable friends of his own were ex-
posed,—considering also the great interest felt by all classes in those
beautiful displays of equestrian emulation which rendered the race-
course of Epsom the pride of the world,—considering that the Sove-
reigns of this country had often given plates to be run for-and
considering, lastly, that if the law took its course, some very esti-
mable members of their Lordships House would most likely be called
upon to pay very heavy sums, he (Lord Bnough AM) would propose
that the standing orders be suspended, to enable the Bill to be read
a second time, to be committed, and to be read a third time without
delay. This course having been agreed to, the House adjourned.

PYRAMUS AND THISBE,
3 (Tragic 33allau.
I sing not now in joyous strain,
To suit these mirthful pages ;
Mine is a tale of love and pain,
Black blood and by-gone ages.
Some people's wit is small indeed—
But smaller still must his be,
Who's never had the luck to read
Of Pyramus and Thisbe.
I do not write for such a dunce,
My task would be in vain;
Let those who've blubbered at it once,
Now read, and weep again.
Of all the beauties of the East,
Fair Thisbe was the star,
And Nature gave her—last not least—
A very cross mamma.
Next door there lived a “nice young man,”
One Pyramus by name ;
And laughing Cupid soon began
To kindle up the flame.
Then came soft words and softer sighs,
And “hearts for ever true,”
And radiant eyes, like suimmer skies,
And little billets-dour.
Next Thisbe 'd ask to go and walk,
Upon some sly pretence,
And then they’d meet alone, and talk
Across the garden-ſence.
At last her mother caught her out—
And scarlet grew her forehead.
“My stars 1 miss, what are you about?
Good gracious me, how horrid . "
She locked her up—our hero, too,
Was lectured by his father:
“Do that again, sir! just you do
And won't I whop you—rather l’”
He begged and prayed : the governor
Still gave that answer gruff–
“Lord ; what’s the .#. lovin’ her
A boy like you, sir! stuff!
“Come, get along ! what's all this fuss
Let’s have no more, sir, pray !”
With broken heart poor Pyramus
Turn'd in despair away.
He moped all day, and talked to none,
Through dim and lone woods wending;
Men cried, “If this be lover's fun,
Our hearts are worth defending !”
When day was done, the night again
Brought visions of his fairy:
Alas ! how vain the tender pain,
“In statu pupillari.”
He cried, “O this is hard, indeed—
I mayn't caress my love, nor
With blameless word win blameless meed—
O cruel, cruel guv'nor l’’
I said, you know, some time ago,
Their houses stood contiguous;
Not dos-à-dos, but in a row—
I hate to be ambiguous.
Well, little Love, who's up to snuff,
In pitying nuood, one day,
Proposed a plan; and sure enough
They tried, and found it pay.

They searched above, they searched below,
To find affection's keyhole ;
Till—just when all appear'd “no go,”
They found a little wee hole.

A rotten brick had come in two—
They saw the cranny—nay, more,
They saw their love by peeping through
º ! “Quid non sentit amor?”
They poked the useless brick away
By digging out the mortar;
And there they passed the livelong day
In whispers and “soft sawder.”
Then, Thisbe 'd cry, “Oh dear, oh dear,
My eyes are full of dust, love;
You must come round and kiss me here,
Indeed, indeed, you must, love.”
And then, poor Pyramus would say,
“God bless me, how can this be?
I’ve kissed a dirty lump of clay,
And not my pretty Thisbel
“Bad wall, bad wall! thy chink is small,
Thy big stones almost hide her:
Why leave the little hole at all
Unless a little wider
“O will you meet me quite alone
To-morrow night, my dear,
Beyond brass-gated Babylon
Where walls can't interfere.
“Let's meet by nine, at Ninus' tomb,
Under the mulberry-tree,
The moon that lights the sunless gloom
Shall light my love to me.”
'Tis night—the moon has flung her beam
Far down the glowing wave,
Where rolls Euphrates' silent stream
Fast by the monarch's grave:—
The night-wind bids the forest groan
And leafy branches reel;-
But, Lord ' Who's this—and all alone—
In such a déshabille.
'Tis Thisbel hear it, wise mammas,
The lesson's told concisely,–
Don't bother Love by bolts and bars,
Or you’ll be diddled nicely .
For though her mother—cross old cat—
Had safely locked her in,
She knew a trick worth two of that,
And did n't care a pin.
She soon escaped—no matter how—
And ere the bell tolled nine,
Sat trembling where the forest bough
Danced in the pale moonshine.
She sat and watched the waters roll,
And more impatient grew :—
At last she heard a horrid growl,
“Oh dear, what shall I do ſ”
“Speak, Pyramus! Where are you ! Oh,
I hear that growl again l
How can you leave your Thisbe so
You must—you must be slain "
She’d hardly done, when, trotting by,
A lion fresh from slaughter,
With black blood drenched, and savage eye,
Came from the woods to water.
Poor Thisbe shuddered at the sight
Not relishing his “ivory;”
“Besides, especially to-night-
It's very hard to die—very 1
“I’ll run and hide behind an oak,
My stars just hear him swallow ;
I’d better first throw off º cloak,
I wonder if he’ll follow "
The lion on a hawthorn spray
Descried the mantle dangling,
She’d washed it out that very day,
He stopped—and did the mangling.
But ahl the brute was hardly gone
When Pyramus drew near—
“My Thisbel Where's my love—my own—
Good gracious me ! what’s here?
“Oh, Thisbe, dearest, are you dead;
Can this torn robe say true?
All pawed and clawed and bloody red,—

Then out he drew his shining blade,
“Grim Death—a friend art thou–
My folly's slain earth's fairest maid I
I’ll not survive so now !”
With that, he gave a deadly dig,
Another, and one more,
Then kicked and hollo'd like a pig-

treatment of the ruffians who guarded him had caused the youn
Prince to dwindle down astonishingly) in the cocked hat of the
representative Roederer. It is well known that, in the troublous,
revolutionary times, cocked hats were worn of a considerable size.
He passed a considerable part of his life in Germany; was con-
fined there for thirty years in the dungeon of Spielberg; and, escap-
ing thence to England, was, under pretence of debt, but in reality
from political hatred, imprisoned there also in the Tower of London.
He must not be confounded with any other of the persons who laid
claim to be children of the unfortunate victim of the first revolution.
The next claimant, HENRI of Bond EAux, is better known. In
the year 1843, he held his little fugitive Court in furnished lodgings,
in a º district of London, called Belgrave Square. Many of
the nobles of France flocked thither to him, despising the persecu-
tions of the occupant of the throne ; and some of the chiefs of the
British nobility, among whom may be reckoned the celebrated and
chivalrous Duke of Jenkins, aided the adventurous young Prince
with their counsels, their wealth, and their valour.
The third candidate was his Imperial Highness PRINce John
Thomas NApoleon—a fourteenth cousin of the late emperor; and
said by some to be a Prince of the House of Gomersal. He argued
justly, that, as the immediate relatives of the celebrated Corsican had
declined to compete for the Crown which was their right, he, Prince
John Thomas, being next in succession, was, undoubtedly, heir to
the vacant Imperial throne. And in support of his claim, he appealed
to the fidelity of Frenchmen and the strength of his good sword.
His Majesty Louis PHILIPPE was, it need not be said, the illus-
trious wielder of the sceptre which the three above-named princes
desired to wrest from him. It does not appear that the sagacious
monarch was esteemed by his subjects, as such a prince should have
been esteemed. The light-minded people, on the contrary, were
would have been ennuyéed to death before they could have marched
from the Rhenish, the Maritime, the Alpine, or the Pyrenean
frontier upon the capital of France. The French people, however,
were indignant at this defect of communication in their territory,
and said, without the least show of reason, that they would have
preferred that the five hundred and seventy-five thousand billions
of francs which had been expended upon the fortifications should
have been laid out in a more peaceful manner. However, behind
his forts, the king lay secure.
As it is our aim to depict in as vivid a manner as possible the strange
events of the period, the actions, the passions of individuals and
parties engaged, we cannot better describe them than by refer-
ring to contemporary documents, of which there is no lack. It is
amusing at the present day to read in the pages of the Moniteur
and the Journal des Débats the accounts of the strange scenes which
took place.
The year 1884 had opened very tranquilly. The Court of the
Tuileries had been extremely gay. The three and twenty youngest
Princes of England, sons of her Majesty Victoria, had enlivened
the balls by their presence. The Emperor of Russia and family
had paid their accustomed visit; and the King of the Belgians had, as
usual, made his visit to his royal father-in-law, under pretence of
duty and pleasure, but really to demand payment of the Queen of
the Belgians' dowry, which Louis Philippe of Orleans still resolutely
declined to pay. Who would have thought that in the midst of
such festivity danger was lurking rife; in the midst of such quiet
rebellion 1

Louis XVI. This is the twenty-fourth pretender of the species who
has asserted that his father was the august victim of the Temple.
Beyond his pretensions, the poor creature is said to be pretty harm-
less ; he is accompanied by one or two old women, who declare they
recognise in him the Dauphin ; he does not make any attempt to
seize upon his throne by force of arms, but waits until Heaven
shall conduct him to it.
“If his Majesty comes to Paris, we presume he will take up his
quarters in the palace of Charenton.
“We have not before alluded to certain rumours which have been
afloat (among the lowest canaille, and the vilest estaminets, of the Me-
tropolis), that a notorious personage—why should we hesitate to
mention the name of the Prince JoHN Thomas NApoleon —has
entered France with culpable intentions, and revolutionary views.
The Moniteur of this morning, however, confirms the disgraceful fact.
A pretender is on our shores; an armed assassin is threatening our
peaceful liberties; a wandering, homeless cut-throat, is robbing on
our highways; and the punishment of his crime awaits him. Let no
considerations of the past deter that just punishment: it is the duty
of the legislator to provide for the future. Let the full powers of the
law be brought against him, aided by the stern justice of the public
force. Let him be tracked, like a wild beast, to his lair, and meet
the fate of one. But the sentence has, ere this, been certainly
executed. The brigand, we hear, has been distributing (without any
effect) pamphlets among the low ale-houses and peasantry of the
department of the Upper Rhine (in which he lurks); and the police
have an easy means of tracking his footsteps.
“Corporal Crâne, of the Gendarmerie, is on the track of the unfor-
tunate young man. His attempt will only serve to show the folly of
Pretenders, and the love, respect, regard, fidelity, admiration,
reverence, and passionate personal attachment in which we hold our
beloved Sovereign.”
Second Edition 1—Capture of the Prince 1
“A courier has just arrived at the Tuileries with a report, that after
a scuffle between Corporal Crâne and the ‘Imperial Army, in a
water-barrel, whither the latter had retreated, victory has remained
with the former. A desperate combat ensued in the first place in a
hay-loft, whence the Pretender was ejected with immense loss. He is
now a prisoner—and we dread to think what his fate may be It
will warn future aspirants, and give Europe a lesson which it is not
likely to forget. Above all, it will set beyond a doubt the regard,
respect, admiration, reverence, and adoration which we all feel for
our Sovereign.”
Third Edition 1
“A second courier has arrived—the infatuated Crâne has made
common cause with the Prince, and for ever forfeited the respect of
Frenchmen. A detachment of the 520th Léger has marched in pur-
suit of the Pretender and his dupes. Go, Frenchmen, go and conquer!
Remember that it is our rights you guard, our homes which you
march to defend ; our laws which are confided to the points of your
unsullied bayonets;–above all, our dear, dear Sovereign, around
whose throne you rally
“Our feelings overpower us. Men of the 520th remember your
watchword is GEMAPPEs, your countersign, VALMY.”
“The Emperor of Russia and his distinguished family quitted the
Tuileries this day. His Imperial Majesty embraced his Majesty the
King of the French with tears in his eyes, and conferred upon their
RR.H.H., the Princes of Nemours and Joinville, the grand cross of
the Order of the Blue Eagle.”
“His Majesty passed a review of the Police force—the venerable
monarch was received with deafening cheers by this admirable and
disinterested body of men. Those cheers were echoed in all French
hearts § long, long may our beloved Prince be among us to receive
them!
3Fortign Intelligence.
We understand that the celebrated case of the two Kilkenny cats—
who, shut together in a garret, fought each other until nothing of them
remained but their tails, has been under the serious consideration of the
Five Powers, with a view to its application to the present state of Spain.
It has, consequently, been resolved upon that no foreign intercourse
whatever shall be permitted with that country for the next five years.
That time elapsed, it will be curious to know how much will remain of all
parties of the Spanish. Bets run that nothing will be found but their

THE NUN OF BERMONDSEY.
taking the Veil.—(Sibthorpe fecit.)
In the Morning Papers we find this advertisement :—
ONVENT of MERCY, Bermondsey.—On Thursday, Feb. 15, a LADY
will receive from Bishop Griffiths the RELIGIOUS VEI L and the HOLY HABIT
of our BLESSED LADY of MERCY, in the Church of the Most Holy Trinity, Ber-
mondsey. The ceremony will commence at 12 o'clock precisely. Tickets may be run-
chased at the following Catholic Booksellers, &c., &c.
We really think the show—considering it is made a purchasable
recreation—a very shameful interference with the privileges of that
admirable actress, Miss Kelly. It will of course be in the vivid
recollection of at least half-a-dozen enthusiasts who visited that lady's
jewel-case of a theatre, (No. 424 Dean-street, Soho,) that the actrees
has the sole acting right of The Sister of Charity. She has played it at
least a hundred times for “hire and reward” as the statute runs; she
was, moreover, the original Sister, and has, inalienably, a copyright
in the sympathies and tears of a British public for that character.
What, then, is to be said of the Manageress (whoever she may
be) of the theatrical Convent of Mercy, Bermondsey Is it fair, we
ask, to pirate the white veil of a sister actress Of course, had not
the exhibition been advertised as one of the amusements of the
day, we should have passed it in silence : but we cannot suffer
such unfair opposition without a word of protest. And why, we
ask, sell tickets for the exhibition ? Surely, Bishop Griffiths, like Mr.
Macready or any other theatrical star, does not require enormous
terms for his acting on the occasion ? Why should the Abbess of
the Convent set herself up against Miss Kelly, the rightful Abbess of
Dean-street We ask of the Lord Chamberlain, is the Convent
licensed for theatrical representations? If not, we trust Miss Kelly
will take her legal remedy.
We had written thus far, when a letter was brought us. Re-
cognising a female hand, we, of course, dropt our pen, and broke the
seal.
“Mr. PUNCH,-I am just come back, with my two grand-daughters,
Heloise and Susannah, trolloping all the way from Bermondsey.
They told me as how they had bought tickets for The Sister of Mercy,
and as I always loved a play dearly, and they told me it would no
doubt be very cutting, I drest myself for the theatre. Well, sir,
knowing nothing of Bermondsey, or indeed anything of the play-
houses on that side of the water, I didn't know where I was taken
till I found myself near the stage, as I thought, and the show about
to begin. I then wanted to buy a bill of the play and some oranges,
but, look where I would, couldn't see any woman. Well, sir, the
music began, and a young lady—a very pretty creature, I must say—
drest in white muslin and crowned with white roses, came on. There
was a deal of ceremony gone through, and Heloise sobbed, and
Susannah blubbered ; but I told them to be quiet for a couple of
noodles, for they were only looking at a show. How, sir, could I
think otherwise, when we had paid our money for tickets (according
to an advertisement) to see the whole affair? Well, Mr. Punch,
judge my astonishment when I found out that there was no sham in
the matter—that the real nun had been advertised just like the last
mermaid, or the Jibbeway Indians !
“Well, sir, my object in writing to you is to ask if these things are
licensed by Act of Parliament, and, if not, by what means can I get
my money back again I should, of course, expect to pay to see
Miss Vincent, or any other person ‘of domestic tragedy' as a nun,
because she's one of the stage people, and gets her bread by it ; but
Miss Crudden (for that, I find by the papers, is the nun of Ber-
mondsey's name), or any other real nun, ought not to meddle with the
living of the poor players.
“Your's, Mr. Punch,
“HANNAH STIFFBAck.”
“P.S.. I'd forgot to say that since the show Susannah does nothing
but sigh “to take vows’ of some sort, and Heloise has dropt more
than one hint of retiring from the world for ever. Now, sir, what
these sights may work in the brains of foolish girls nobody can tell
Nuns may become so common, that honest men may soon want wives.”

THE ESCAPE FROM THE PENITENTIARY.
(From our own Reporter.)
Nothing since the escape of Buonaparte from Elba has created
such a sensation in the neighbourhood of Milbank as the flight of the
seven prisoners from the Penitentiary. The first alarm was given by
policeman B, (probably B flat), who, on seeing several men crawling out,
of the moat, rushed round to the door of the Penitentiary, and kicked at
it for a quarter of an hour without effect, after which he gallantly drew
his truncheon, and poked at the grating, giving an occasional whistle
through the bars; but until he rammed a bit of stick through the key-
hole, and shrieked between the crevices of the door, he gained no atten-
tion. In the mean time, the seven prisoners had skirted the outer row
of cabbages which form the natural defence of the embankment, and
having kept close under the trenches—of celery—had succeeded in getting
beyond the lines of rhubarb, almost as far as the breastwork of privet,
before the policeman had fairly given the alarm ; which was no sooner

(the ALARM ll)
spread than the whole of the Penitentiary authorities were called out of
bed, and a consultation was at once held, when the Governor was unani-
mously elected into the counterpane. The head turnkey, who occupied a
Witney blanket, proposed the first resolution, which was to order a fly
for the purpose of pursuit; and the question having been decided by a
show of nightcaps, thanks were voted to the Governor for his impartial
conduct in the quilt, and the meeting separated in order to pursue the
runaways. The ordering of the fly—which has been facetiously termed
by the press, “taking prompt measures,”—was of course calculated to give
time to the fugitives; and the fly, with four wardens inside, three turnkeys
on the box, and a policeman on the footboard behind, started off with all
the velocity that circumstances would permit, in the direction of nowhere
in particular. A brief consultation with the turnpike-man in the Vauxhall-
bridge-road decided them to turn towards the north, when a further con-
sultation among themselves induced them to go eastward; but a hint from
the driver subsequently determined them to pursue a westerly direction.
From inquiries on the road, it was found that all the policemen had seen
all the fugitives, and all thought them sweeps, so that after wishing them
all good morning, they had all taken no further notice of any of them.
Subsequently, by the purest accident, four of the prisoners were over-
taken at Chiswick, and having been surrounded by a sudden jerk given to
the horse, so as to get the fly and the animal into a semicircle, the
fugitives at once surrendered, throwing themselves on the generosity of
their pursuers, who repaid this confidence by handcuffing the whole four,
thrusting them neck and crop into the fly, and driving them into a corner,
where the authorities indulged in beer, and the horse had his nostrils
freshened with a moist hayband. The captives were ultimately lodged
in the Penitentiary, with strict injunctions from the Governor not to
attempt to get out again.

THE CLOCK OF ST. CLEMENT’S.
We are extremely sorry to announce the fact, that the Clock of
St. Clement's experienced, in the course of last week, a relapse of a
very alarming character. The violence of the alterative to which it
had been subjected by the action of the nerves of the pendulum, and
the exercise of the internal organs, together with the fatigue attend-
ant on the use of the hands, no doubt contributed to cause the return
of the late tedious malady under which it had been so long suffering.
The unhappy sufferer was seized with a stoppage of the same afflicting
nature as that which rendered the Clock, during the whole of the last
summer, a subject of the most painful interest. The following bul-
letins were issued in the course of the week :-
Tuesday Morning.—The Clock of St. Clement's was seized in the
middle of the night with a total paralysis of the pendulum.
'uesday Erening.—The Clock has passed a quiet day, but is not
better.
Wednesday Morning.—The Clock has been subjected to an active
stimulant, and pulsation appears to be partially restored.
Wednesday Noon.—The nerves of the pendulum have resumed their
action; the hands are beginning to come round; and it only wants
time to set it to rights completely.
Wednesday Afternoon.—The Clock is going on as well as can be
expected.
No further bulletin has been issued ; and it is confidently hoped that
the Clock of St. Clement's has not yet arrived at its last moments.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A WORD OR TWO ON THE PLAYHOUSES.
Punch does not now often visit the playhouses; though, by the
way, he very shortly intends to do so. For no self-recreation, let it
be understood, does he again propose to show himself in the theatre,
but solely for the sake of the world at large, sorely abused as it is
by bad actors, and often by worse critics. The wisdom of Parlia-
ment having all but destroyed the drama, has declared it free This
is the humanity of a barbarian, who, having well-nigh starved his
victim to death, gives him, whilst in articulo mortis, his unconditional
liberty. The wisdom of Parliament 1 A gaggling goose will ofttimes
bring the said wisdom to our recollection—an ass, braying to the
winds, will now and then awaken the same thoughts.
In the mean time, Covent-Garden is now made a sort of House of
Commons, and a house of call for fiddlers. Drury-Lane is
“Most musical, most melancholy;”
that is, we have opera there one ni
ght, and Charles KEAN's tragedy
another.
CIGBER AND shakspr. Alte.
The Lyceum has recently been opened as a sort of dramatic rat-
trap. There was a flourish of trumpets, and a most hospitable invi-
tation to gentlemen of dramatic genius to bring their plays. “Gen-
tlemen authors,” thus spoke the courteous management, “please to
walk in, and be murdered.” It was moreover announced, in terms
of the most cold-blooded satisfaction, that “two comedies and a
farce” had been already “accepted.” The blood of three writers
was not enough : no, the management called for more. The trea-
surer, however—(what a perplexing person, by the way, is the play-
house treasurer ()—made a simple remonstrance of empty pockets,
and the playhouse closed. And now, as we have been privately
informed, do the Lyceum cats meet at midnight on the stage, and
yainly ask of one another when Mr. MacReady may be expected
back from America to take the concern. Now and then, too, a ghastly
advertisement appears in the Times, and, looking almost ashamed to
tell its story, informs the world that “The Lyceum is to be let tº
The Haymarket is flourishing on Shaksprah E. duly rosined, and
French dishes. Mr. Weast ER has shown that the country abounds
with writers of comedies. Rattling a purse of five hundred sove-
reigns, he has caused the investment of many shillings in pens, ink,
and paper, and the result is—one hundred and fourteen five-act comedies,
all written to illustrate modern life and manners I We fear, how.
ever, that many of the writers will have been cruelly misled by
newspaper paragraphs. It was stated that Mr. FARREN was to be
upon the committee of judgment: whereupon, of course, a very fine
old man, a sort of prize Sir Anthony Absolute (having fed upon the
rest of the characters), is, we doubt not, in at least a hundred and
seven of the plays. Again, Madame Vest Ris and Mrs. Gloven
were to have voices in the selection of the one comedy. With this
belief strong in the bosom of the writer, can we doubt that he had
a natural eye to another Little Devil, another Mrs. Subtle Any way,
however, we rejoice at the offer made by Mr. Websten. The Hay-
market is stocked with original stuff for years to come. For though
many of the offered dramas may not do as whole five-act comedies,
they may, with judicious cutting and twisting, serve as farces and
interludes. We doubt not that some dramatic tinker may be found,
who, at a mere red-herring and potato salary, will be able to make
the required metamorphosis. For ourselves, though Punch has sent
in no comedy, we wait with almost delirious expectation for the ver-
dict of the committee. It cannot, however, be known for some
weeks. The reason is plain. One hundred and fourteen comedies
The committee cannot, with justice to themselves and the writers,
go through more than two comedies at a sitting : this, then, will take
fifty-seven days. Now, deducting Sundays, and allowing, say twenty
days for sickness—inevitable nausea on the part of the readers—we
know not how we can expect the verdict much before May. Yes;
the prize comedy will come out with the hawthorns. In the mean-
time, we think Mr. Websteh would only show a proper feeling for
the anxiety of the town, were he to inform it, from time to time, of
the health and spirits of the reading committee. Indeed, why not
publish a bulletin in the daily play-bills 1
| The Princess's Theatre is made a sort of theatre of ease to the
Italian Opera-House, where prime donne, tenori, and others, are trans-
lated for the million. What, however, it professes to do it does well,
and flourishes on its good intentions.
The Adelphi is still in the Strand, but it is not the Adelphi of by-
gone years. For, though neither its literature nor its actors were
likely to lift its audiences into the sixth heaven of gentility, there
was purpose in its dramas, and robust drollery in the acting. Now,
if the pieces are not jewels of the first water, they are assuredly
things of the readiest paste. As for acting, there is certainly one low
comedian, who, with the aid of the gallery, does all he can to spoil a
humourist. The worst of it is, he generally succeeds.
The Olympic is to the Adelphi what the tap is to a tavern. The
pieces smack of the spittoon; but they are often things of real life :
the more especially when a live horse and real cab from St. Clement's
stand are introduced upon the scene.
And such are London play-houses in the year 1844 One of them,
however, is about to disappear: for it is confidently reported that
the Duke of BEDFond intends to pulſ down Covent Garden, and to
enlarge the market on the site of the playhouse. However, with the
liberality that distinguishes the house of Russell, his Grace, it is said,
intends to offer to several of the late performers, at that establish-
ment, stands in the enlarged market, rent-free. Hence, if she will,
Mrs. Nisbett may sell peaches ripe as her comedy—luscious as her
laugh. John Cooper (by virtue of his tragedy old men) has
already claimed a stand for Spanish onions. Two or three drama-
tists—their names, by the way, have not transpired—are spoken of
as the future vendors of cabbage.
CITY INTELLIGENCE,
SINCE the commencement of the Mayoralty of Magnay, the Man-
sion House has been one continued round of splendid hospitality.
A joint on one day, cold the two next, and assisted with boiled rice
or pancakes on the fourth, has been the basis of the festive arrange-
ments for the last two months. It is true that the Lord Mayor,
being fond of seclusion, only extends his hospitality to a small circle,
which may be described as a circle is generally described in all the
arithmetical treatises, O.
Some curiosity was excited by a turkey being seen to arrive by a
carrier's cart at the Mansion House, and it was expected that the
unusual event would have been celebrated by the temporary enlarge-
ment of the Mansion House dinner parties to the extent of two or
three of the citizens. His Lordship, however, did not depart from
his usual domestic habits; and, on the second day, he presided at a
family hash, after which he liberally settled the contingent remainder
on the household servants, and intends, we believe, presenting the
drum-sticks to the band of the Ancient Lumber Troop.
Charity on the “Rail.”
MR. C. Russell stated in the House (February 5), that “several of the
Railway Companies were carrying passengers, in the third-class trains, at
a decided loss.” Who would have believed there was such sympathy for
the poor But the public should know its benefactors | If Mr. Russell

loss,” Punch will confess that “Truth is stranger than Fiction.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
“PUNCH A CONSPIRATOR.”
to Sir Robert Peel,.
SIR,-Sergeant Murphy having, on Friday last, in the House of Com- |
mons suggested that “the Attorney-General should prosecute Punch as
a conspirator,” because Mr. Cobden, in the spirit of Mr. O'Connell quoted
a portion of my writings, I hereby beg leave to state, in order to save
the Government any needless trouble, that I will wait to be duly served
with notice of action, from one till two on Monday next, at my office,
194, Strand. After that hour, my boy Dick must be inquired of as to
my whereabout.
Now, Sir Robert, quite in the spirit of old acquaintanceship, I wish to
have some amicable talk with you. In the first place, as to the jury-list.
I must have no “accident” occur in the striking of the names; I can't
consent to have a string of honest garret-holders shuffled away—lost—a
cigar lighted with the paper—or, Heaven knows what No, Sir Robert,
that juggle won't do twice. |
Secondly, I have a vehement objection to any prosecution by your
Attorney-General; for it can be proved that Sir Frederick Pollock, when
counsel in a certain criminal case at York, did aver that no man who had
a faith in Punch, “was to be believed upon his oath !” What fairness
am I to expect at the hands of such a prosecutor? In the next place,
Sir Frederick, although up to the present time he has disguised his real
character, is at heart a most intemperate, pugnacious man. What
guarantee, then, have I that he will not pistol my counsel even in his
exordium ? My counsel has no wish to show his brains, by having them
blown about the court. Certainly, if I chose to avail myself of his
service, I have still an advocate whose brains are by this time proof
against any accident. I mean Lord Brougham ; who in the most cordial
manner has offered to conduct my defence. His cordiality, however,
determined me to reject the offer. I had seen the boa-constrictor fed at
the Zoological Gardens, and I well remember how he slavered the victim
lamb before he bolted it. Having refused his Lordship, I of course shall
have him against me as a Government witness. |
I also protest against any tampering with the London press. I will
have no chaffering to buy a cheap pennyworth of The Morning Herald,—
no summoning of its servants on their own “spiced” reports of Punch for
“the London market.” No, Sir Robert; don't turn justice into a beldam,
going about to debauch the little remaining honesty of her neighbours.
And now, Sir Robert, where will you get your jury Your Attorney-
General says, he “will have no man with a faith in Punch.” No :
“such a man is not to be believed upon his oath.” Where, then—I re-
peat the question—will you get your jury I see them at once, and will
anticipate your list :

can't.

destroy my influence Can you shut up my shop P Can you close 194,

heart beats—for you quicken my circulation.

Real Philanthropy.
THE Lawyer, whose name was struck off the rolls the other day, to
enable him to follow “Philanthropical pursuits,” has already commenced
in earnest his new career of charity. His first act, we understand, was
a week's subscription to the Morning Post. Such genuine benevolence
1.cº's no comment. The complete sacrifice of self ennobles the action.
If, however, you should determine to gratifying to the simple-minded individuals who are the subject of his
judicious eulogy. The delight his Lordship expresses at the notion, that
he has the sympathy of “every honest man, and every virtuous woman,”
is exceedingly touching. We know that human sympathies are very
large; but their comprehensiveness must be extreme, and their elasticity
utterly caoutchoucian, if they stretch so far as Lord William Paget fancies
they do.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.-OF HUSBAND AND WIFE.
tº E now come to treat of Husband
A and Wife, and shall inquire, first,
how marriages may be made,
which will be interesting to
lovers; secondly, how marriages
may be dissolved, which will be
interesting to unhappy couples;
and lastly, what are the legal
effects of marriage, which will be
interesting to those who have
extravagant wives, for whose
debts the husbands are liable.
To make a marriage three
things are required :—first, that the parties will marry ; secondly, that
they can ; and thirdly, that they do; though to us it seems that if they
do, it matters little whether they will, and that if they will, it is of little
consequence whether they can ; for if they do, they do ; and if they will,
they must ; because where there is a will there is a way, and therefore they
can if they choose ; and if they don't, it is because they won't, which brings
us to the conclusion, that if they do, it is absurd
to speculate upon whether they will or can marry.
It has been laid down very clearly in all the books,
that in general all persons are able to marry unless
they are unable, and the fine old constitutional
maxim, that “a man may net marry his grand-
mother,” ought to be written in letters of gold over
every domestic hearth in the British dominions.
There are some legal disabilities to a marriage,
such as the slight impediment of being married
already; and one or two other obstacles, which
are too well known to require dwelling on.
If a father's heart should happen to be particu-
larly flinty, a child under age has no remedy, but
a stony guardian may be macadamised by the Court
of Chancery; that is to say, a marriage to which
he objects may be ordered to take place, in spite
of him. Another incapacity is want of reason in
either of the parties; but if want of reason really
prevented a marriage from taking place, there
would be an end to half the matches that are
entered into.
A considerable deal of the sentiment attaching to
a love affair has been smashed by the 6 and 7th of
William IV., c. 85, explained by the 1st of Victoria,
c. 22,-for one act is always unintelligible until
another act is passed to say what it means. This
statute enables a pair of ardent lovers to rush to
the office of the superintendant registrar, instead
of to Gretna Green; and there is no doubt that if
Romeo could have availed himself of the whole-
some section in the act alluded to, Juliet need not
have paid a premature visit to the “tomb of all the
Capulets.”
Marriages could formerly only be dissolved by
death or divorce; but the New Poor Law puts an
end to the union between man and wife directly
they enter into a parochial Union. Divorce, ex.
cept in the instance just alluded to, is a luxury
confined only to those who can afford to pay
for it; and a husband is compelled to allow
money–called ali-money—to the wife he seeks to be divorced from.
Marriages, it is said, are made in Heaven,
registrar be a little paradise, we don’t see how a marriage made before
that functionary can come under the category alluded to.
A husband and wife are one in law—though there is often anything but
unity in other matters. A man cannot enter into a legal agreement with
his wife, but they often enter into disagreements which are thoroughly
mutual. If the wife be in debt before marriage, the husband, in making
love to the lady, has been actually courting the cognovits she may have
entered into ; and if the wife is under an obligation for which she might
be . attached, the husband finds himself the victim of an unfortunate
attachment. A wife cannot be sued without the husband, unless he is
dead in law ; and law is really enough to be the death of any one. A
husband or a wife cannot be witness for or against one another, though a
wife sometimes gives evidence of the bad taste of the husband in select-
ing her.
% wife cannot execute a deed ; which is, perhaps, the reason why
Shakspeare, who was a first-rate lawyer, made Macbeth do the deed,
which Lady Macbeth would have done so much better, had not a deed
done by a woman been void to all intents and purposes.
By the old law, a husband might give his wife moderate correction ;
but it is declared in black and white that he may not beat her black and
blue, though the civil law allowed any man on whom a woman had
bestowed her hand, to bestow his fists upon her at his own discretion.
The common people, who are much attached to the common law, still
exert the privilege of beating their wives; and a woman in the lower
ranks of life, if she falls in love with a man, is liable, after marriage, to
be a good deal struck by him.
Such are the chief legal effects of marriage, from which it is evident,
but unless the office of the says Brown, that the law regards the fair sex with peculiar favour; but
Smith maintains that such politeness on the part of the law is like amia-
bility from a hyaena.

Rofessor GREAsewheel is lecturing be-
fore the Assmulean Society on AEsthe-
tics; the learned gentleman proposes
that a new professorship should be
founded, to instruct the undergraduates
in art, under the name of the Artful
Dodger, and he has no doubt that Sir
Robert Peel will see the propriety of
furnishing the requisite endowment
from the public purse. If it could be
effected, he should be happy to see three of these
Dodgers appointed ; one in Oxford, another in
Cambridge, and a third in the University of Lon-
don. He purposes further, that they should lec-
ture in each University successively, as he thinks
Oxford dodges would be of much use in Cam-
bridge, London dodges in Oxford, and so on : in
fact, that a communication of ‘wrinkles' would
be established, which could not but prove a very
great advantage to the rising generation. He
noticed particularly the connexion between art
and theology, and it is expected that, should his
proposal be carried into effect, the Oxford
Dodger will commence his duties with a course
of lectures on Tract No. 90.
The Architectural Society have kindly offered

tendered by parties of the highest respectability, for the execution of
both these important works of art, and the designs are said to be of the
most elaborate description.
The
HISTORY OF THE NEXT FRENCH REVOLUTION.
[From a forthcoming History of Europe.]
CHAP. II.-HENRY W. AND NAPOLEON III.
Sunday, February 30th.
WE resume our quotations from the Débats, which thus introduces
a third Pretender to the throne.
“Is this distracted country never to have peace While on Friday
we recorded the pretensions of a maniac to the great throne of
France; while on Saturday we were compelled to register the
culpable attempts of one whom we regard as a ruffian, murderer,
swindler, forger, burglar, and common pick-pocket, to gain over the
allegiance of Frenchmen—it is to-day our painful duty to announce
a third invasion—yes, a third invasion. The wretched, superstitious,
fanatic, Duke of Bordeaux, has landed at Nantz, and has summoned
the Vendéans and the Bretons to mount the white cockade.
“Grand Dieu ! are we not happy under the tri-color? Do we not
repose under the majestic shadow of the best of kings? Is there any
name prouder than that of Frenchman; any subject more happy
than that of our sovereign Does not the whole French family
adore their father? Yes. Our lives, our hearts, our blood, our
fortune, are at his disposal: it was not in vain that we raised, it is
not the first time we have rallied round, the august throne of July.
The unhappy duke is most likely a prisoner by this time; and the
martial court which shall be called upon to judge one infamous traitor
and Pretender, may at the same moment judge another. Away with
both 1 let the ditch of Vincennes (which has been already fatal to
his race) receive his body too, and with it the corpse of the other
Pretender. Thus will a great crime be wiped out of history, and the
manes of a slaughtered martyr avenged 1
“One word more. We hear that the Duke of JENKINs accompanies
the descendant of Caroline of Naples—an English Duke, entendez-vous!
an English Duke, great Heaven l and the princes of England still
dancing in our royal halls Where, where will the perfidy of Albion
end ?”
“The King reviewed the third and fourth battalions of police. The
usual heart-rending cheers accompanied the monarch, who looked
younger than ever we saw him—ay, as young as when he faced the
Austrian cannon at Walmy, and scattered their squadrons at
Gemmapes.
|
“Rations of liquor, and crosses of the Legion of Honour, were dis-
tributed to all the men.”
“The English princes quitted the Tuileries in twenty-three coaches
and four. They were not rewarded with crosses of the Legion of
Honour. This is significant.”
“The Dukes of Joinville and Nemours left the palace for the de-
partments of the Loire and Upper Rhine, where they will take the
command of the troops. The Joinville regiment, cavalerie de la
marine, is one of the finest in the service.”
“Orders have been given to arrest the fanatic who calls himself
Duke of Brittany, and who has been making some disturbances in
the Pas de Calais.”
“ANEcDot E of His MAJEsty.—At the review of troops (police)
yesterday, His Majesty going up to one old grognard, and pulling
him by the ear, said, ‘Wilt thou have a cross or another ration of
wine !” The old hero, smiling archly, answered, “Sire, a brave man

can gain a cross any day of battle, but it is hard for him sometimes
to get a drink of wine? We need not say that he had his drink, and
the generous Sovereign sent him the cross and ribbon too.”
On the next day, the government journals begin to write in rather
a despondent tone regarding the progress of the Pretenders to the
throne. In spite of their big talking, anxiety is clearly manifested,
as appears from the following remarks of the Débats —
“The courier from the Rhine departments,” says the Débats, “brings
us the following astounding proclamation :-
“Strasburg, xxii Nivose. Decadi. 92nd year of the Republic, one
and indivisible, We, John Thomas NApoleon, by the Constitutions
of the Empire, Emperor of the French Republic, to our marshals,
generals, officers, and soldiers, greeting :
** Soldiers 1
“‘From the summit of the Pyramids, forty centuries look down
upon you. The sum of Austerlitz has risen once more. The guard
dies, but never surrenders. My eagles, flying from steeple to steeple,
never shall droop till they perch on the towers of Notre Dame.
“Soldiers the child of your Father has remained long in exile. I
have seen the fields of Europe where your laurels are now withering,
and I have communed with the dead who repose beneath them.

They ask where are our children Where is France Europe no
longer glitters with the shine of its triumphant bayonets—echoes no
more with the shouts of its victorious cannon. Who could reply to
such a question, save with a blush —And does a blush become the
cheeks of Frenchmen ;
“‘No. Let us wipe from our faces that degrading mark of shame.
Come, as of old, and rally round my eagles You have been subject
to fiddling prudence long enough. Come, worship now at the shrine
of Glory ! You have been promised liberty, but you have had none.
I will endow you with the true, the real freedom. When your ances-
tors burst over the Alps, were they not free ? Yes: free to conquer.
Let us imitate the example of those indomitable myriads; and,
flinging a defiance to Europe, once more trample over her; march
in triumph into her prostrate capitals, and bring her kings with her
treasures at our feet. This is the liberty worthy of Frenchmen.
“‘Frenchmen I promise you that the Rhine shall be restored to
you ; and that England shall rank no more among the nations I
will have a marine that shall drive her ships from the seas; a few of
my brave regiments will do the rest. Henceforth, the traveller in
that desert island shall ask, “Was it this wretched corner of the
world that for a thousand years defied Frenchmen º'
“‘Frenchmen, up and rally —I have flung my banner to the
breezes; ’tis surrounded by the faithful and the brave:—up, and let
our motto be, LIBERTY, Equality, WAR All over THE World !
“NApoleon III.”
“The Marshal of the Empire, HAR1cot.’”
“Such is the Proclamation such the hopes that a brutal-minded
and bloody adventurer holds out to our country. “War all over
the world,' is the cry of the savage demon; and the fiends who have
rallied round him, echo it in concert. We were not, it appears,
correct in stating that a corporal's guard had been sufficient to seize
upon the marauder, when the first fire would have served to con-
clude his miserable life. But, like a hideous disease, the contagion
has spread; the remedy must be dreadful. Wo to those on whom
it will fall !
“His Royal Highness the Prince of Joinville, Admiral of France,
has hastened, as we before stated, to the disturbed districts, and
takes with him his catalerie de la marine. It is hard to think that the
blades of those chivalrous heroes must be buried in the bosoms of
Frenchmen : but so be it : it is those monsters who have asked for
blood : not we. It is those ruffians who have begun to quarrel :
not we. We remain calm and hopeful, reposing under the protection
of the dearest and best of sovereigns.
“The wretched Pretender, who called himself Duke of Brittany, has
been seized, according to our prophecy: he was brought before the
Prefect of Police yesterday, and his insanity being proved beyond a
doubt, he has been consigned to a strait-waistcoat at Charenton. So
may all incendiary enemies of our Government be overcome :
“His Royal Highness the Duke of Nemours is gone into the depart-
ment of the Loire, where he will speedily put an end to the troubles
in the disturbed districts of the Bocage and La Vendée. The foolish
young Prince, who has there raised his standard, is followed, we
hear, by a small number of wretched persons, of whose massacre we
expect every moment to receive the news. He too has issued his
proclamation, and our readers will smile at its contents:
“‘WE, HENRY, Fifth of the Name, King of France and Navarre,

ITS DANGERS AND CURIOSITIES.
ost surely it is high time that the state
should turn its attention to Mesmerism.
Of what avail the thousands and hun-
dreds of pounds subscribed by nobles
and bishops for the goodly purposes of
Christian education, when professors of
mesmerism are suffered to sap the very
foundations of civil society (as Colonel
Sibthon p would say), by making the
innocent unintentional felons : Within
these few days, one WILLIAM Bow Ex
has been charged at Worship-Street
with stealing a linen sheet; when his
brother (a professor of mesmerism) de-
fended the prisoner, alleging that he
committed the felony when in a state
of “mesmeric coma.” The professor
further alleged, that “the mesmeric
influence operated in different ways
upon the accused; for, on a former occasion, he manifested a disposition to
destroy everything that came in his way.” It appeared that his last attack
had been produced by a visit to the Surrey Theatre. We know not what
is at present acted at that favoured resort; but if it be Jack Sheppard, or
any of its class of drama, we need not call in mesmerism to account for the
stolen property. The magistrate, however, was deaf to the appeal of science,
A and the mesmeric felon was sent to gaol for one-and-twenty days. This was
the more unfortunate for the Professor, as he had determined upon a forth-
coming lecture, in which his brother, though blindfolded, was to have read any
book—thus displaying his powers of clairvoyance. Pity it is, that WILLIAM
Bow EN had not, by such means, made himself master of the Act of Parliament
MESMERISM ;

which punishes sheet-stealing with lodgings in
We, however, return to our first opinion. Par-
liament ought to appoint a committee to inquire
into the philosophy of “mesmeric coma;” other-
wise, the judges, in their ignorance, may continue
to imprison and transport the unfortunate as
merely committed forgery, burglary (bigamy, by
the way, we think a very likely offence, under the circumstances),
highway robbery, and coining, when in a state of mesmeric oblivion.
If mesmerism be a true thing, and capable of turning the moral self
of man thus inside out, ought not its practice to be put down by
statutes ? In the good old times, our careful fathers burnt and
drowned witches; astrology was condemned ; nay, even in our day,
the fortune-teller taken in the fact, is sentenced, by the unrelenting
magistrate, to the revolution of the tread-mill. Hawk-eyed propriety
forbids the intrusion of gypsies into Greenwich Park, lest Easter maids
and apprentices be thrown into delirious coma by the golden promises
of the scarlet-vested sybils. Why, then, should the man of mesmerism
be suffered to tamper with that very delicate clockwork, the moral
principle, keeping time for better or worse, in all men Heaven
knows, that, like the clock of St. Clement's Church, it is of itself too
apt to vary; now going fast, now slow, and now entirely standing
still. We need no Mesmeric professor to set the whole mechanism
in disorder. We again ask, why is a Doctor ELLIotson permitted to
mesmerize, when some venerable John Hocus Pocus is dragged from
Field-lane or Breakneck-steps, for simply divining to Molly the maid
the complexion and handicraft of her future husband, and the number
and sex of the children whereof he is to be the happy and honoured
father The Doctor, operating upon some WILLIAM Bow EN, trans-
forms him into an unconscious robber. The vulgar conjuror sends
Molly home six inches higher with the thoughts of speedy marriage;
whereupon, she tells her mistress to “answer the bell herself;” and,
for such impertinence, Molly is straightway told, to “pack up her
alls,” and trudge. The conjuror is punished for the mischief he may
do—the mesmerist escapes scot-free : and wherefore ? Oh, he is a
professor
Be it understood, we venture no irreverent fling at Mesmerism.
No ; we confess our ignorance. We will not swear that it may not
rank with the noblest truths as yet vouchsafed to man : we will not
swear that it is one iota beyond the manly and athletic science of
pea-and-thimble. Still, wishing, as zealous watchers of public morals,
to be upon the safe side, we will allow, with its advocates, that
Mesmerism, like poetry, is “a true thing;” that it is mysteriously
subtle in its operation, “deep almost as life;” that it sets at nought
all individual character, all human responsibility, making those who
voluhtary felons, when, in fact, they may have
gaol.
suffer it unconscious apostates—monstrous libels upon themselves—
fools, zanies, mountebanks! We will allow this, and so allowing,
ask with deeper earnestness for heavy penalties upon those who
practise this newest Black Art. No man, woman, or child may be
safe from it; therefore, we hazard no extravagance in assuming a
few cases, and, upon their social importance, asking for new and
stringent laws to reach them.
Mesmerism—so treasonous is the heart of man—might be practised
upon the “highest personage in the land.” Who shall say what its
effects might be — who shall answer for their strange develop-
ment Whilst suffering the “coma,” that high personage might
command to Windsor table a very rabble of English philosophers,
poets, sculptors, artists. Up to the present time not one of them has
a chance of seeing even the “unused cut pieces” of royal bread—
unless, indeed, as a future pauper ; but by the aid of Mesmerism,
science and literature, like the boy Jon Es, might slip in.
Another personage, second to the “highest,” might, if mesmerised,
cast into oblivion the military cap, and do nothing but invent new
spatterdashes for her Majesty's army.
Can we hide from ourselves the danger of the mesmeric coma on a
temperament like that of the Duke of CAMBRIDGE In a state of
total unconsciousness, might he not, to his own ruin, insist upon
paying his brother Yonk's debts, and sending bank cheques to all
the charities of London :
Consider, too, the probable effects of Mesmerism on the House of
Lords. Let us suppose Lord Bhough AM in a state of coma. Might
he not, in this condition, behave like agentleman for at least a whole
sitting f
But we have said enough, we trust, to awaken the Govern-
ment to a sense of the social danger involved in Mesmerism,
unless duly guarded by enactments. Having shown its perils,
it is now our pleasing task to lay before the reader many of its
advantages.
On the 23rd ult. Messrs. HughEs and HAGLEY illuminated the dim
region of Hammersmith with a mesmeric lecture, in which the
wonders of clairvoyance were surprisingly exhibited by a young
gentleman, who, on being blindfolded by a member of Parliament,
told all his votes for the next two sessions. We were not present
ourselves at the lecture, but are indebted to “our reporter” for
a faithful account of the proceedings. The following conversation
took place between Mr. Hughes and the “young gentleman” mes.

Thus, it will be seen that if Mesmerism have its perils, it also has
its profits. It may, to be sure, send one person to prison, but it
may make another a faithful narrator to the people of all the other-
wise hidden doings of their magistrates and rulers.

Rom our own CoRREspondent AT PEkin. We
have received advice, through the medium
of our Flying Post, of a public meeting
which was last week held in that city, for
the purpose of promoting the abolition of
British slavery.
The meeting took place in the factory of
an eminent philanthropist and merchant,
named Twan-Kay, who was voted unani-
- - mously into the chair.
The proceedings were opened by the Chairman ; who, after a brief
summary of the events of the late war with England, and the loss and
bloodshed which it had entailed upon China, proceeded to observe, that
his countrymen had a fine opportunity of returning good for evil, which
he hoped they would take. The Celestial Court was now on amicable
terms with that of Great Britain; with which international treaties would
now, from time to time, be contracted. In the next treaty, he trusted,
a clause would be introduced, which would have the effect of putting
down British slavery. He then proceeded to give a graphic and vivid
description of the sufferings of British slaves in mines and factories, and
the agricultural districts; and dwelt at great length on the horrors of
the workhouse. During this part of his speech, many of the ladies
(who formed a large portion of the audience) fainted. He concluded by
an assertion of the principle, that all mankind were members of one family;
and said that the eyes of the world were upon China, who expected that
every Chinaman would do his duty; and that one duty of the Chinaman
was the protection of the slave whether in England or elsewhere. He
then sat down amid much applause.
The attention of the assembly was next claimed by Chou-Shong, an
influential mandarin, who had lately arrived from a visit to England,
which he had spent principally in the metropolis. After stating that he
fully concurred in all that had fallen from the worthy chairman, he
begged leave to direct the attention of his auditors to a subject, which he
(the chairman) had omitted to mention. He alluded to the condition of
a peculiar description of British slaves, termed linendrapers' assistants.
Immeasurably inferior as were the barbarian English in point of intellect
and civilisation to his countrymen, the inhabitants of the Celestial Empire;
still they were men, and, as such, entitled to sympathy. The linendrapers'
assistant, though an Englishman, was still a man. The sufferings of this
description of British slaves would melt the heart of a stone, and make
the pig-tail of an executioner stand on end.
The linen-draper's assistant or slave, was a young man from sixteen to
twenty-five years of age. His occupation consisted in serving in the
draper's shop ; and his daily labour lasted about fifteen hours; with an
interval of about half-an-hour for meals. During the whole of this time
he was obliged to remain standing ; which was a punishment equivalent
to that of the pillory. Indeed, the only difference between his case and
that of a convicted rogue in China, consisted in the latter having to wear
a wooden collar; whereas, the former wore a white neckcloth. The
atmosphere of the shop in which he worked was so vitiated by the respi-
ration of the number of his fellow-slaves crowded into it, and in consequence
of .# ill ventilated, as to be intolerable for any length of time; and at
night, the quantity of gas consumed in it rendered it almost pestiferous.
To these sufferings he was exposed six days in every week, from six or
seven in the morning to eleven, or twelve, or later at night. So short a
time was he allowed for meals, that he was obliged to swallow his food
like a Vulture or a Cormorant. Linendraper's slaves generally slept, to
the number of twenty or thirty, in one room; where, in consequence,
the air was positively poisoned. During their six days of work they
were never permitted to take a walk; and on the seventh, on which they
"were ...” a day's liberty by law, they never thought of attending
tº sº Beº>
the temples or churches; on the contrary, they usually spent that day
in idle and dissolute company, not knowing, from the uncultivated state
of their intellects, what better to do. he combined effect of their
compulsory mode of life and their personal habits, was such as to
plunge them in a very low state of mind and physical degradation.
The English, although barbarians, were naturally a fine race of men. He
would exhibit to them a picture (holding it up) of an Englishman. That
was the average standard of the English form and proportions. Such was
the picture of John Bull—the individual representative of the national
character. They would mark the strength and muscularity of the limbs,
the breadth of the shoulders, the depth of the chest ; and the fresh, ruddy
colour of the cheeks. (Sensation amongst the ladies.) He would now
show them the portrait of a linendraper's slave (producing it). They
would observe the wasted limbs; the inward bend of the knees; the
attenuated frame; and the sallow, emaciated cheeks. (Erclamations.)
Such were the effects produced by slavery. Its consequences often
proved fatal in two or three months; and, even if they did not, reduced a
brawny Englishman to the state which they beheld. Consumption, fever,
liver complaints, and a thousand other maladies, resulted from this hor-
rible system. He called on all present to do their utmost, little though
that might be, to put a stop to it; and diffuse the blessings of Chinese
liberty over the unhappy land of Albion. (Vociferous cheering.) He
should say no more ; and begged pardon for having detained the meeting
so long. He then resumed his seat, amid protracted cheering.
An individual, whose name did not transpire, inquired whether it was
not true, that it was a common saying in England, that Britons never
would be slaves
Chou-shong replied that that was quite true ; but, like many other say-
ings, it was all nonsense. The linendraper's slave, unless he did all that
was required of him, and that without a murmur, was discharged from
his employment. He had then the option of starving or going into the
workhouse ; and if that was not slavery, he should like to know what
was 1 (Applause.)
The Chairman then proposed a resolution, to the effect that his Celes-
tial Majesty the Emperor be forthwith humbly solicited to command the
British Legislature to abolish all slavery within the English dominions;
or, at least, to compel masters, and especially linendrapers, to treat their
slaves with humanity.
The resolution having been carried by acclamation, the meeting
separated.
JEMIMA
SPRIGGS AT !!!
oubtless our readers are familiar with the
celebrated danseuse, Jemima Spriggs, whose
Highland Fling and Rowing Hornpipe have
been the admiration of every saloon in the
suburbs. The following letter, which we have
obtained at an enormous outlay, shows that
the fair writer is as remarkable for intelli-
ence and truly feminine vivacity, as she
is for the brilliancy of her Terpsichorean
achievements. We have suppressed the
name of the locality to which she alludes,
and leave our readers to pick about Penton
ville, Islington, and Hoxton.
“DEAR LETTY,
“Here I am at last, and the awful period of probation is passed.
Veni, vidi, vici. My Fling' has been seen at the –– Saloon ;
admired, applauded—drawn money ! Having just got over the fluster of
success, I sit down to give you a plain narrative of my progress.
“Our parting as I entered the Paddington omnibus you, of course,
recollect. Never shall I forget the kindness with which you ran back to
our lodging for my gingham umbrella, and the pertinacity with which you
required the driver to stop till you returned with it. Well ; what with
nibbling my Abernethys, and munching the nice large apple you gave
me, my journey in the omnibus proceeded pleasantly enough. It is a
curious reflection when in one of these vehicles, that one sits so quiet
one's self, and yet the wheels are twirling round beneath one. We
thus see, that in this great world two things may be going on at the same
time. But a truce to philosophy
* At the corner of Street I alighted, and asked of an old apple-
woman my road to the Saloon. The dear old soul informed me, and
out of gratitude I purchased two apples, which I pleasantly told her
ought to be called a pear (pair). She did not laugh, and I at once per-
ceived that a constant adherence to commercial pursuits deadens the fine
perception of wit.
“Following my nose—as our dear Herbert used to say—I soon came
to the –– Saloon. I sent in my card, and asked to see the manager.
He was a stout corpulent man, dressed in a suit of rusty black. Time
had been unable to quench that cunning which sparkled in his eye. But
I was as cunning as he. I was resolved to have fifteen shillings per
week, not a farthing less; and all remonstrance on his part would be
absolutely useless. I mentioned these terms in a firm voice. The manager

drew a papier maché box from his pocket, tapped it, took a pencil, and
said nothing. I again stated my terms, but he thrust his hands to the
bottom of his trousers pocket, and #. a long whistle. Nothing daunted,
I again demanded the fifteen shillings; upon which my antagonist drew
his right hand from his pocket, and fixing the thumb firmly on his nose,
moved the fingers with amazing celerity. I perfectly understood the sign,
as I remembered Herbert making use of it, when a brutal cabman asked
two-pence more than his fare.
“I retreated, but it was like a Parthian, with the resolution of con-
quest. To a tavern opposite I went, where the flat roof of the ground
floor is elegantly fitted out with benches and tables, all in the open air, at
once allowing one to inhale the fresh breeze of Heaven, and to take a
commanding view of the street. I could keep my eyes on the Saloon,
and—what was of more importance—the manager could see me. I called
for a glass of rum and water, my favourite beverage you know, and
ºthi the proceedings of the enemy. Presently he emerged from his
domicile, and gave me a full stare; but I affected not to see him. He
crossed the road. My heart palpitated at the thought of victory. I heard
a few heavy steps—and lo! the terrible manager was at my elbow.
I did not raise my eyes, but appeared marvellously intent on the little
piece of lemon which floated on the surface of the liquor, and which
I every now and then plunged down with my spoon. “I have come
to offer twelve shillings a week : " said the well-known voice.—“Walker 1"
I ejaculated playfully, committing a plagiarism, which you will pardon, on
dear Herbert's vocabulary. “Well, then,” said the manager, “take the
whole fifteen shillings, and —.” The coarse expression, which my pen
refuses to write, did not annoy me. I felt that I had gained my point,
and to the female heart what so delightful as conquest ?
“That very evening I made my début. I was not a little nervous as to
the result. I had, to be sure, my best Tartan dress; but how was I to
know whether the people in this part of the world could appreciate the
“Fling.” Through a hole in the curtain I surveyed my audience. There
were several honest-looking men dressed with regard rather to substan-
tiality than fashion. When the curtain rose I shook off my nervousness,
and dashed on the stage with my well-known buoyancy. For a few moments
there was a silence: my heart sunk, but my courage was quickly restored.
The cries of “She’ll do 1"—“Bravo 1"–" Well, I'm blowed,” burst
from every corner, and your beloved Jemima, after curtseying to her
audience, deeply suffused with blushes, was compelled to repeat her
characteristic pas. With this record of my triumph I close my letter.
“Adieu, dearest Letitia,
“JEMIMA.”
Heyday, here's a pretty business A letter from Miss Jemima Spriggs
herself, declaring that the above was not written by her at all. What
are we to do? We have it ! We will put in Miss Jemima's private letter;
so that the public may have the poison and the antidote together.
“MistER PUNCH,

To THE NOBILITY & GENTRY-A BABY WANTED !
In the Times of the 22nd ult, was the following touching advertise-
ment :-
Tº The NOBILITY AND GENTRY.—As Wet-Nurse.—A lady, who
-L has two children, intending to give her baby, a month old, to her mother, who lives
at a distance, and wishes to adopt it, would be happy to take a CHILD to WET-
NURSE. Any parents or guardians placing their child with her may rely on its receiv-
ing the greatest possible kindness and care; a nursemaid is kept, and the child would
have the benefit of going to the sea in the season; the lady is young, and has plenty of
milk. (Here follows the address.)
Beautiful is liberality—more beautiful are the instincts of maternal
tenderness | Here is a woman (a real “lady,”) in the handsomest
way “gires her baby, a month old, to her mother :” relatives inter-
change presents of sucking-pigs and geese with equal cordiality.
The mother wishes “to adopt” her own grandchild; to turn it, as it
were, into her own baby, sinking the grandmother in the mamma
herself. Whereupon the bereaved mother (“with plenty of milk,”
doubtless that of human kindness included) looks towards the
nobility and gentry for consolation, and will take a “child to wet-
nurse,” (if with a title, doubtless the better,) treating it with the
“greatest possible kindness and care,” the suckling defrauded of its
rightful breast having been adopted by grandmamma . We really trust
that some newly-made mother of the nobility or gentry will respond
to “C. E. B.” (for such are her initials.) Should she, however, be
disappointed in obtaining so sweet and endearing a recommendation
to the notice of any of the nobility or gentry, we have not the
slightest doubt that “C. E. B.” can be accommodated with a baby to
suckle on a proper application at any of the Unions.

“GENTLEMEN JEWS” AND PUNCH.
MAN certainly looks awkward, even when called
upon by dulness itself, to explain his joke,
Punch is at this moment in such predicament,
In the Number before last, Punch wrote what
indeed he thought a small, yet very pretty
piece of satire, on those times when our
ancestors conceived that they best aired their
Christianity by persecuting the Jews. We
therein observed that the world still held to-
gether, albeit compelled to forego those pre-
judices which, in the opinions of some, hooped
society about, and made it whole. We made,
as we thought, a good fling at the brutality
and ignorance of The Morning Post for its many sins against the tribe of
Israel, (though we did not particularize its infamous support of that
brutal madman of Russia in his conduct towards the suffering
Hebrew). Well, for this, our misunderstood satire, a “Jew" com-
plains to the Times, the Chronicle, and lastly to ourselves; and that
in serious condemnation of “the grossness of language" and
“malice” of what, in the innocency of our heart, we thought a
rap on the knuckles of by-gone bigotry and present uncharitable-
ness. We beg of a “Jew” to read us again under the direction of
some quick-witted friend ; then, are we certain, he will be sorry
for the bitter words with which he has bespattered us. In our
sufferings, however, we have illustrious company. Great men, even
before Punch, have been misunderstood and reviled by dulness for
their best intentions. One Daniel Defoe wrote A Short Way with the
Dissenters, satirically advocating their social rights; when his leathern-
eared clients read him backwards, and would have sacrificed their
champion. When Gulliver's Travels were first published, did not
a certain Bishop condemn the work as a book of lies, avowing that
“he didn't believe a word of it?” Shall Punch, then, complain,
even when in his “trumpery sphere,” as Sidney Smith would say,
he advocates the common rights and liberties of the Hebrew, and
yet for such advocacy is arraigned of “malice, prejudice, and
jealousy,” even by “a Jew "

HE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RAIL-ROAD. MANIA,
EALLY the most remarkable instance in modern
roads, is to be met with at the two and a half
mile-stone on the Hammersmith Road, where
a few capitalists have been amusing them-
selves by the construction of a new West
Suburban, Grand Paddington and Warwick-
square Junction, or Earl's Court Canal Naviga-
tion and Kensington Nursery Ground Railway.
The effect of which appears to be to enable
persons arriving from Birmingham by the
Great Western, to reach the basin of the Canal,
running from Warwick Square to the pond in the middle of Earl's
Court, with as little delay as possible.
We undertand that the Directors rely on the tremendous traffic
likely to ensue between the two and a half mile-stone on the Ham-
mersmith Road, and the London terminus of the Great Western
Railway. It is contemplated also that the inhabitants of Warwick
Square will be constantly wanting to run backwards and forwards to
Paddington, which, when the houses are all built—at present there
are only two—will materially assist the effects of the Company.
Supposing that the Square ultimately comprises thirty houses, and
supposing each family to consist of ten persons, including servants,
this will give a population of three hundred, so that if only half of
them wish to go to Paddingdon every morning it will be seen that the
shareholders may calculate, from this source alone, on 1,800 pas-
sengers every week; that is to say, supposing the 150 persons who
are supposed to want to go to Paddington, are all supposed to want
to come back again, and are also supposed to choose the West Sub-
urban Grand Paddington and Warwick-square Junction, &c. &c.,
Railway as the best mode of reaching their destination. Another
great point, as the Directors implicitly believe, is the propinquity of
the basin of the canal; for it is a well-known fact in railway statis-
tics, that a line which is not near a canal, bears the same proportion
to a line that is near a canal, as the M* of X does to the O* of 24,
or the XX of Alpha. It is quite true that the canal goes nowhere
at present; but there is no knowing where it may go to in time, if
the spirit of speculation should push it to the extent of all its
capabilities.
It is calculated that a goods train, in connection with this canal,
would be highly remunerative, supposing that Pickford should re-
move his warehouses to Warwick-square, which is not at all beyond
the range of a very remote possibility. At all events, come what
may, that is to say, if nothing ever comes at all, the Paddington
washerwomen may be induced to bring their clothes to the vacant
space about Earl's-court for the purpose of drying them ; and in this
case it would be worth while to start a clothes-train expressly for
their accommodation. They might be allowed the additional privi-
lege of boiling the clothes in the copper of the engine, and perhaps
they might, at a small extra charge, be permitted to mangle them
under the wheels of the luggage trains.
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL PROTECTION SOCIETY.
At the late meeting of this Society, at the Freemasons' Tavern, the
following, we understand, were among the resolutions agreed to ; but
somehow or other they did not appear in the papers:—
Resolved:—That the rook, by destroying that unprofitable consumer
of grain, the grub, is, scarcely less than the Dukes of Richmond and
Buckingham, entitled to the appellation of the farmer's friend, and there-
fore ought decidedly to be encouraged.
That rook-shooting and the eating of rook-pies are altogether incom-
patible with the encouragement of the rook, and that accordingly the
amusement ought to be discountenanced, and the dish renounced, by all
members of the Society.
That rookeries are an invaluable blessing, as well to the farmer and
agricultural labourer, as to the landowner, and that all existing rookeries
ought to be maintained in the full enjoyment of their rights and privileges;
this resolution, however, not to extend to the Rookery in St. Giles's.
That this Society views with great alarm the ravages annually committed
by the sparrows in harvest time, and recommends that prompt measures
be taken by all persons interested in agriculture for the suppression of
sparrows. That with this view the boys in the several parishes be
encouraged to take and destroy as many sparrows' nests, with their eggs
and young, as possible, and that at all future dinners of the Society and of
its branches, one or more large sparrow-puddings be placed upon the table.
That Natural History teaches that butterflies lay eggs, which, when
—. -–
times of the Mania that exists for making rail- |
— — -
hatched, become grubs. That butterfly hunting, besides being a salutary
and wholesome exercise to youth, is conducive to the extirpation of grubs,
and be promoted accordingly. And that, to insure its promotion, a
committee with reference thereto, be forthwith appointed by the Society.
That although seven or eight shillings a week is a very liberal allowance
for a labourer with a wife and family, and quite enough to enable him
and them to live in clover on the same ; and although a comfortable
asylum in sickness, want of employment, or old age, has been provided
for him in the Union workhouse, yet, as mistaken notions on these points
unhappily prevail among the agricultural population; which mistaken
notions, there is some reason to suspect have occasionally led to the
burning of wheat-ricks: it is expedient that an advance of three farthings
weekly be made on the wages of such labourer.
That landlords and farmers are ill-used and unprotected, and are the
most patriotic and disinterested classes of the community.
That the manufacturing interest enjoys exclusive and unjust privileges;
and that the corn-law abolitionists are narrow-minded, selfish, and
designing individuals.
That these resolutions be printed in Punch.
GOING OUT A SHOOTING.
Blest age when lawyers ape the deeds
Of Bayard and the Cid,
And scorn the peaceful “Practices,”
Of Impey and of Tidd
When big wigs leave the courts and change
(Of arms blood-thirsty takers),
The venue to the Phoenix park,
Or to the “Fifteen Acres.” +
When charged with dirt, Pot asks if Crock
To him the slur applies,
And bids him state, “if not, why not,”
Or show “how otherwise.”
Then seeking “satisfaction” claims
To take up arms—jus ſlendum—
By right of martial capias
Ad satisfaciendum.
Whilst each his “friend” sends for a leech,
And arms, and to bespeak 'em,
At parting serves said “friend” with a
Subpaºna duces tecum.
Or, p'rhaps too fierce, to wait until
Without the fame of Nemesis,
Cries, “Let us load at once and have
An “action on the premises.’”
But ah! sometimes one big wig proves
A peaceful man–God bless us !
And 'gainst such “motions,” from the court,
Implores a stet processus.
What then does tother big wig Pshaw
One hardly sure need ar it.
He “bolts his bounce,”—in other words
He “enters a retraarit.”
MORAL.
Henceforth let all fierce lawyers shun,
(As but their soulst to catch meant),
The “right of challenge” and be friends,
By “process of attachment.”
THE CUT BREAD AT THE PALACE.
The royal arrangements for distributing the bits of “Cut Bread” left at
the royal dinner-table work exceedingly well, and it has now become the
fashion amongst the guests of her Majesty to call continually for “Another
bread,” even when the piece before them is unfinished. Sir Robert
Peel, by way of carrying out the benevolent views of his royal mistress,
generally cuts off merely the crumby end of his bread, and leaves the
crusty majority to be paid into THE BREAD-BASKET BANK, which has been
expressly opened for the benefit of the Windsor paupers. It is, we believe,
in contemplation to provide every poor person with a sort of check-book,
enabling him to draw whenever he is hungry to the extent of one slice, or
he may give a bill at a week, payable in mouthfuls. We understand that
an eatinghouse-keeper has undertaken to keep the bread account of the
Palace, so that if the whole of the leavings are paid in daily it may be
invested at once in any of the bread-pudding or bread-sauce speculations
of the concern, and thus the paupers would have the advantage of draw-
ing out the bread in accordance with the demands of their appetites.

TO THAMES MARINERS.
IN consequence of there being a supposed rock off Hungerford, which
the Suspension Bridge may be very likely to split upon, the elder brothers
of the Trinity House have determined on fixing a light-house on the mud
and broken bottle bank, lying in latitude 8; from Greenwich, and 13 from
Hyde Park Corner. The light-house will be in the form of a flat candle-
stick, the flat form being adopted as more in conformity with the scheme
of the Bridge to which it will be an adjunct. A look-out will be con-
stantly kept from the handle, and persons wrecked will be good enough to
inquire for the officer in charge of the save-all. The British flag will be
kept floating from the handle of the extinguisher, which will be kept on
during the day, and hauled up on her beam ends at night, so as to allow
the snuff to get athwart the bows of the weathercock. There will be a
boy stationed aloft, whose.duty, it will be to keep the light constantly
snuffed, which will be accomplished by lowering the arrow of the weather-
cock, which is made to turn on a pivot, and to open so as to embrace the
main top of the candle.

PROTECTION TO AGRICULTURE.
We are happy to perceive that a League has at length been formed, in
order to protect the cultivators of . water-cress against the
competition of the artificial vegetable produced in ordinary slop-basins.
At a numerous meeting of the suburban growers, it was moved by Mr.
Jones, and seconded by Mr. Brown—
“That the cultivation of the water-cress is the . of every
Englishman ; and that Great Britain owes her reputation for domestic
virtue chiefly to her temperance.”
It was moved by Mr. Snooks, and seconded by Mr. Poulter—
“That if temperance is the divinity that adorns the shrine, tea is the
pedestal it stands upon.”
It was moved by Mr. Edwards, and seconded by Mr. Toddledown—
“That it is expedient to enhance the aroma of the tea by the fragrance
of the water-cress."
It was moved by Mr. Spinks, and seconded by Mr. Tillybody—
“That the slop-basin never has been, never was, never will, and
never can be, the hope of the agriculturist; and that it is against the in-
terest of the British farmer to plant water-cress, or any other vegetable
production, in a slop-basin, which is adapted more to the tea-spoon than
the ploughshare.”
It was moved by Mr. Whobbles, and seconded by Mr. Kilderkin—
“That the puddle is the natural home of the water-cress, while the
slop-basin is its prison; the former expanding it into rooty richness, the
latter forcing it into a leafy luxuriance, ending in premature ruin.”
It was moved by Mr. Swiggles, and seconded by Mr. Whapentake—
“That this meeting pledges itself to stand by the plough, the whole
plough, and nothing but the plough.”
The following contribution to the Anti-Slop-Basin Fund was then
announced :-
One who has whistled (in vain) for a dinner . . 320 0 6
The chairman stated that the amount required would be thirty shillings,
and there was every hope of obtaining it.
Several members having wished he might get it, the meeting was
dissolved.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTh.—or PAR ent And child.
- E now come to the tender subject
of parent and child, which Shak-
speare has so tenderly touched upon
in many of his tragedies. Macduff
calls his children “chickens,” pro-
bably because he “broods” over the
loss of them ; and Werner, in Lord
Byron's beautiful play of that name,
exclaims to Gabor, “Are you a
father 1" a question which, as the
Hungarian was a single man, he
- could not have answered in the
affirmative without rendering himself amenable to the very stringent
provisions of the 45th of Elizabeth. -
Children are of two sorts—boys and girls : though the lawyers still
further divide them into legitimate and illegitimate. -
The duties of a parent are maintenance and education ; or, as Coke
would have expressed it, grub and grammar. That the father has a
right to maintain his child is as old as Montesquieu-we mean, of course,
the rule, not the child or the parent is as old as Montesquieu-whose
exact age, by the bye, we have no means of knowing:
Fortunately, the law of nature chimes in with the law of the land; for,

working of parental affection ; though it is rather awkward for parental
affection to take a pugilistic turn in its extraordinary zeal to show itself.
The last duty of a parent is to educate a child, or to initiate him into
the mysteries of Mavor at an early period. Learning is said to be better
than houses and land—probably because it opens a wide field for the
imagination—that Cubitt of the mind—to build upon.
The old Romans, says Hale, used to be able to kill their children; but
he adds that “the practysse off cuttinge offe one's own hair was thougghte
barber-ous.” This atrocious pun reminds us of the cruelty of a certain
dramatist of modern times, who used to write pieces and take his own
children to see them, thereby submitting his own offspring to the most
painful ordeal, for they were compelled to sit out the whole performance,
and were savagely pinched if they fell asleep, while they were, at the
same time, expected to laugh and look cheerful at every attempt at a joke
which their unnatural father had ventured to perpetrate. In conformity
with the maxim that “paterna potestas in pietate debet non in atrocitate
consistere,” it is believed that a child in such a dreadful position as that
which we have alluded to, might claim to be released by his next friend,
for the time being, the box-keeper.
A parent may correct his child with a rod or a cane—a practice ori-
ginally introduced to encourage the growers of birch, and to protect the
importers of bamboo, as well as to promote the healthy tingling of the
juvenile veins; and a schoolmaster, who is in loco parentis, is also em-
powered to do the like by an old Act of Parliament, known as the statute
of Wapping.
Children owe their parents support; but this is a mutual obligation,
for they must support each other—though we sometimes hear them de-
though there is a game, called “None of my child,” in which it is 'claring each other wholly unsupportable.
customary to knock an infant about from one side
of the room to the other, still there is that natural
orropyn in the parental breast that fathers and mothers
are for the most part willing to provide for their
offspring.
The civil law will not allow a parent to disinherit
his child without a reason; of which reasons there
are fourteen, though there is one reason, namely,
having nothing to leave, which causes a great many
heirs to be amputated, or cut off, even without the
ceremony of performing the operation, with a shilling.
Our own law is more civil to parents than the civil
law, for in this country children are left to Fate and
the Quarter Sessions, which will compel a father,
mother, grandfather, or grandmother, to provide for
a child, if of sufficient ability. If a parent runs
away, that is to say, doth spring off from his off-
spring, the churchwardens and overseers may seize
his goods and chattels, and dispose of them for the
maintenance of his family; so that, if a man lodging
in a garret leaves nothing behind him, that must be
seized for the benefit of the deserted children. By
the late Poor Law Act, a husband is liable to main-
tain the children of his wife, whether legitimate or
illegitimate ; and we would therefore advise all
“persons about to marry,” that though it is im-
prudent to count one's chickens before they are
hatched, still it is desirable that chickens already
hatched, and not counted on, should be rigidly guarded
against.
It being the policy of our laws to promote industry,
no father is bound to contribute to a child's support
more than twenty shillings a month, which keeps
the child continually sharp set, , and is , likely
to promote the active growth of the infantine
appetite.
Our law does not prevent a father from disinheriting his child; a Illegitimate children are such as are born before wedlock; being, like

PUNCH*S MIRROR OF PARLIAMENT.
HOUSE OF Lords.
s Lord BRough AM saw the woolsack was vacant,
he would take leave to ask a question.
Lord CAMPBELL said that, if his noble
and learned friend would allow him to sug-
gest, he would recommend his noble and
learned friend to wait till the woolsack was
occupied.
Lord BRough AM would not wait for any
noble lord, but would use his privilege as a
member of that House.
Lord CAM phell : But don't you see that the woolsack is vacant
Lord Baough AM : What have I to do with that I will address
the House from the woolsack myself, and then it will not be vacant.
(Hear, and a laugh.)
Lord CAMPBELL only thought—
Lord Brough AM : No, you don't only think, for you speak also.
I wish the noble and learned lord did only think; for if he only
thought, and never spoke, I, for one, should be much better satisfied.
Lord CAMPBELL : If my noble and learned friend will still per-
mit me—
Lord Bhough AM : My noble and learned friend says, if I will still
permit him. Now, I never did willingly permit him; and, indeed,
the House would not thank me if I did.
Lord CAMPBELL would not ask the permission of any noble lord.
Lord BRough AM : But you did, for you asked mine ; at least that
was the inference.
Lord CAMPBELL : I wish the noble and learned lord would not be
so fond of inferences.
Lord BRough AM : I am not fond of inferences. I never attempt
to draw them ; and, indeed, I cannot do so after you have spoken,
for I defy any one to infer anything from what the noble and learned
lord says. (A laugh.)
Lord CAMPBELL : If the noble and learned lord can be merry at
my expense, he is perfectly welcome.
Lord BRough AM would not have anything at the expense of his
noble and learned friend. His noble and learned friend was not so
rich—in an intellectual point of view—as to be able to afford it.
The Lond CHANcellon having now taken his place on the
woolsack,
Lord Brough AM begged pardon of the House : he had forgotten
that he was occupying the place of his noble and learned friend who
had just taken his place.
Lord CAMPBell remarked that his noble and learned friend
(Brougham) had formerly, when on the woolsack, been apt to forget
himself.
Lord BRough AM admitted that his noble and learned friend never
forgot himself, and seldom remembered others. If the noble and
learned lord could forget himself, his reminiscences might not be so
disagreeable as they must be at present.
The Lord CHANcellon said he had only just entered the House,
but he thought the present discussion seemed to be rather desultory.
Lord CAM phell observed that the noble lord (Brougham) was
quite out of order, for there was no motion before the House.
Lord Bnough AM : Then I will propose one. I move that my
learned and noble friend (Campbell) shall be at liberty to bring for-
ward any measure he may think proper on this day six months.
The motion having been lost without a division, the House
adjourned.
HOUSE OF COMMONS.
COMMUNICATION WIth AMERICA.
SIR VALENTINE BLAKE rose to bring forward his motion on the
subject of communication with America. The Hon. Baronet pro-
ceeded to say that his plan would be a very simple one. (Hear.) He
should propose to cut a canal for ships through the land, and then
carry a railway over the sea, so that vessels might navigate the earth,
and railway trains traverse the broad Atlantic. (Hear, and a laugh.)
He might, perhaps, be taxed with being too sanguine, and he might
be told that the inequality of the waves would present an obstacle to
his plan, on account of the alleged difficulty of finding a level. (Hear.)
Well, he (Sir Valentine Blake) had thought of that—(a laugh)—and
he would meet the objection with the scientific fact, that water—and
he believed he was right in applying the word water to the Atlantic
Ocean, which was water in the very broadest sense of the word—he
repeated, he would meet the objection with the scientific fact, that
water always finds its own level. (Cheers.) Besides, had not Eng-
- land the power to reduce the foaming billow to the undulating
| ripple (Hear.) He (Sir Valentine Blake) would call upon Britan-
nia to fulfil her proud prerogative and rule the waves of the broad
Atlantic. (Great cheering.)
Sir R. PEEL wished to know whether Sir Valentine Blake really
proposed to cut a canal through Ireland; for this, instead of bringing
us nearer to America, would be, in fact, cutting a connection with it.
(Hear, and a laugh.)
Sir WALENTINE BLAKE explained.
Colonel Sibthor PE was glad of an opportunity of expressing his
concurrence in the proposed measure. He had himself once intended
to move for a bill to cut a canal through Waterloo-place, and throw
a railroad over the Thames, so as to form a continued line of commu-
nication between the Bull and Mouth and the Houses of Parliament.
He (Colonel Sibthorpe) was averse to railroads, but if they were to
be erected anywhere, he thought they were more adapted for crossing
the sea; and indeed there was a precedent (hear), for he had heard
several naval friends of his talk of having crossed the line—which he
(Colonel Sibthorpe) believed must be the South Eastern line—on their
passage to India. (Hear, hear, and cheers.)
Sir VALENTINE BLAKE having again risen to explain, the House
immediately adjourned.
MRS, FRY'S PET,
> t may arise from his besetting uncharitableness
of heart, but Punch was never in love with the
King of Prussia. When his Majesty, under the
auspices of good Mrs. FRY, went to Newgate, and
when in the female prisoners' ward, his pious Majesty
dropped upon his knees and prayed, we thought the
King of Prussia, as the lawyers say, proved too much.
The humility, if true, was too good to last. And so it
has proved : for though his Majesty was so very good
a Christian whilst in Newgate, he can, it appears, play
... the Nicholas in little on the Prussian throne. Sweet
and touching is it to contemplate a mighty potentate
of earth down upon his knees with BET Sly, Suke
TAGRAG, Moll Flashly, and twenty other forlorn birds of Newgate,
“in trouble,” for felony and misdemeanour; beautiful indeed, is the
humility The matron wonders, and the turnkeys cry, “Bless us 1
what a pious cretur.” The story is read and told at melting tea-
parties; and the King of Prussia—Mrs. FRY's pet !—is received
into the large and tender bosom of female philanthropy. He is a
king of comfits—a king of sugar-candy
His Majesty returns to Prussia, and with almost the gloss of his
Newgate benevolence upon him, he becomes Jack-of-all-work to the
Emperor of Russia. He is Nicholas's most humble servant : a tool,
a scourge, a Prussian knout in the hand of the imperial executioner.
A number of Poles, dignified by misfortune—ennobled by suffering
patriotism—take refuge in Prussia from the bloody fangs of the
Russian bear. They are—in a holiday mood, it seems, of the Prussian
monarch—permitted by him to find a home in Posen. Their country
destroyed to them, their fortunes shattered by as wild and merciless
a tyrant as Heaven ever permitted to scourge humanity—they are
allowed to find a resting-place in Prussia. They become planted in
the soil; when, lo! Nicholas has ugly dreams about them,-they
disturb his cheerful thoughts, and, as he cannot have them back,
first for the knout, and then for Siberia, why—he begs of his brother
Prussia to banish them, accursed from the land. Whereupon,
Mrs. FRY's pet shews himself obedient to the greater son of
mischief, and, whether or no, the Poles must pack. The soil of
Prussia is not favourable to virtuous misery.
Strange are the sympathies of kings His Majesty of PRussia
could feel for and pray with Illegal Pawning, with Highway Robbery,
with Embezzlement, with Felony, in its many shapes: but for
Defeated Valour, Heroic Suffering, Patriotism, in all its glorious and
glorifying aspirations—all such are nought, and must not find har-
bour in Posen.
In Newgate, the King of Prussia was a Christian ; what a pity that
he should have quitted it to act journeyman despot at home.
The opinion seems generally to gain ground among the savans, that
the Greek characters will supersede or survive all others, inasmuch as
one of them will always be new (v).

POLICE LAURELS,
HE new Police have within these few
days gloriously distinguished them-
selves at King's-Cross, Battle-Bridge.
The fight of Boadicea on that spot is
eclipsed by the police scuffle which has
ended in the capture of a whole com-
pany of “Automaton Actors.” It ap-
pears that theatrical performances had
been exhibited—
“Where gangs of young thieves and the worst
of characters congregated, to the annoyance of
the respectable inhabitants.”
Really, if the cheap drama have such attraction for gangs of
thieves, would it not be as well to permit penny performances in
all parts of the metropolis : The house being filled with thieves,
they can at best but rob one another, and the purses and pocket
handkerchiefs of respectable people remain safe, whilst the robbers
are thus congregated together.
The police entered the house, “disguised as butchers, dustmen, and
other characters.” At a given signal they—
“Rushed behind the scenes, captured the whole of the “automaton actors,” including
the wretch Corder, and his victim, Maria Martin; also the figure of Death, and all the
minor characters. The scenery, machinery, and decoration were then seized and packed
up, and, together with the audience, doorkeepers, money-takers, and saloon-keeper,
were all taken to the station-house, followed by an immense crowd of persons. No less
than 83 persons, men, women, and children, were placed at the bar in batches, and
locked up.”
All this makes a very important achievement in police annals;
nevertheless, may we be permitted to ask of the force, why they
suffered the abomination of “automaton actors ” at all ! Why did
they allow, night after night, “gangs of young thieves” to congregate,
when, at their very first meeting, they should have been dispersed ?
Perhaps, however, the police thought it best to imitate Peel's policy
in Ireland. It would have made no noise at all to have put down
the first meeting. Oh no but 83 persons with “the figure of Death,
and all the minor characters,” taken at one swoop shewed the won-
derful activity of the captors. There is nothing like coaxing and
petting a nuisance into maturity, and then taking great credit to
ourselves for killing the troublesome giant we have fostered.
SONGS OF THE OMNIBUSES.
The SONG OF THE Atlas.
FROM the Nightingale we go
With our team of two in hand,
Yoicks, yoicks, gee up, yo ho,
Full half an hour we stand.
At length we ply the thong,
Nor ply it quite in vain;
Yo ho—we go along,
As we tug, tug, tug at the rein,
Gallop, canter, and trot,
Amble, sidle, and shy,
Gib, and the deuce knows what,
As the thong we actively ply
Down Baker-street, yoho,
Through Oxford-street, ya hips 1
To Regent's Circus we go,
As our near horse stumbles and trips.
Passengers squeeze and cram,
Animals sidle and shy;
Door shut to with a slam,
Over the wood we ply.
Elephant, Charing-cross,
Lambeth, Camberwell-gate,
We cry till our throats are hoarse,
As in Parliament-street we wait.
Driver, conductor, or cad,
Passengers, horses, and all,
Rattle away like mad,
Yo ho—yo ho, is the call.
Hilly, hilly—high.
Onwards zig zag and straight,
Over bridge, over road does the Atlas fly,
And Elephant–Elephant still is the cry,
Till we get to Camberwell-gate.
ANOTHER ART-UNION.

At one guinFA PER HEAD,
entitling every fourteenth
Person to a Shawl,
and the other thirteen to nothing, which will take place under an

of purely philanthropic manufacture, it has been determined to relieve the
FIELD-LANE AND SAFFRON-HILL DISTRICTS
by a grand pocket-handkerchief Art-Union. By this scheme, any person
passing through Field-lane will leave his pocket-handkerchief
IN THE HANDS of THE PROJECTORS,
and on his return he will
Have an Opportunity
of comparing it with others, amongst which it will be suspended, and he
may either purchase his own back again, or may buy
ANY OTHER
that he takes a fancy to, at a very reduced price, thus giving to each
subscriber
A choice FROM AMongst A stock,
which he could not obtain in any other manner.
The Taste and Variety
now displayed in the patterns of pocket-handkerchiefs, in the present
ADVANCED STATE OF THE ART of DESIGN,
renders this an unusually favourable opportunity. It is calculated that of
EVERY HUNDRED PERSONS
who pass through Field-lane, at least seventy-five have handkerchiefs as
they enter at one end, which they cease to possess as they go out at the
other, thus making the district alluded to a counterpart of the
SUNNY ISLES OF BANDANNA.
Information of a practical nature may be obtained by passing along Field-
lane, any morning, noon, or night, and the applicant will soon be convinced
that the scheme has its peculiar

WE have had letters from all our Colonial possessions, including the

incursion from the natives of Upper Deptford, and the Eelpie islanders
were in a state of indignation at the attempt of perfidious Putney to plant
the sword on that soil, which has hitherto nourished only the peaceful
bulrush. It is true that Putney proffers the pretended blessings of ex-
tended commerce, and stretches out her hand, offering treasure for the
eel-pies, which are at present the only wealth of those rude but hitherto
happy islanders. Our possessions at Battersea, continue in a tranquil
state, and our relations in that quarter—for we have an uncle and two
cousins lodging there—are likely to remain permanent.

NEW BRITISH AND FOREIGN DRAMATIC ASSOCIATION.
It is proposed to raise any possible amount of capital, for the bet-
ter production of the French drama, done into English, on the British
Stage. - -
#. projectors observe, with pain and regret, that much valuable
time is suffered to elapse between the first representation of the
original drama on the Paris stage, and its translation on the English
boards. From a want of concert, too, among the most eminent
translators, the French piece comes out at irregular intervals. One
theatre will present the “foreign wonder” on a certain night—
another house, that night se’nnight. The British and Foreign Dra-
matic Association propose to remedy this evil; so that on the same
night the same piece may be produced at every London theatre
within the authority of the Chamberlain.
Without going minutely into all the profuse details of the Asso.
ciation, it may here be necessary to give a general outline of th
principles upon which it will be conducted.
A flock of pigeons warranted carriers, will be purchased for
rapid communication between the French and English capitals.
A body of distinguished French short-hand writers will be engaged.
On the night of a new piece, the writer will visit the Paris theatre,
with his pigeon in a bag. He will take down the whole of the piece on
tissue-paper. This he will immediately attach under the wings of
the pigeon, and, leaving the playhouse, throw up his bird.
The late premises of the Dramatic Authors' Society (Henrietta-
street, Covent-Garden,) have been taken, where the pigeons will
alight from France; and a body of persons, who know French with-
-
out a dictionary, being located on the premises, the short-hand copy
will be immediately delivered out and shared among the translators.
It is calculated, that in thirty-six hours after the production of
the piece in Paris, the said piece will be duly translated into very
average English, and ready for the London boards.
The present price of translation is exorbitantly high. Managers
are known to give as much as fifty shillings for a two-act drama, and
in some instances thirty for a one-act vaudeville. It is to relieve
managers from this oppression that the British and Foreign Dramatic
Association will be established; and, on the consideration that “a
quantity will be taken,” it is thcºight expedient, after the manner of
the Cemetery Companies, to subjoin a scale of prices :-
:
For the Translation of a three-act Drama -
Ditto, with Songs - - - - -
A full Opera, (the poetry good for families)
For a two-act Domestic Melodrama . - -
Very superior, with “intense interest” . -
Ditto, with a moral denouement . - - -
A one-act Vaudeville - - - - - 0 7
All the articles warranted faithful translations, and delivered at
the stage-door, ready for rehearsal, six-and-thirty hours after
production in Paris.

FRENCH PLAYS.
In order to give every possible variety to the performances, Mr.
Mitchell has entered into an engagement with the celebrated naval
comedian, Admiral du Petit Thouars, who will shortly appear in the
farce of Le Maire du Cinquième Etage, which is a French adaptation of
the Mayor of Garratt. The Admiral will fill the character of Major
Sturgeon, and introduce the celebrated description of the taking of the
pump, which has been converted by the French dramatist into a glowing
account of the attack upon and seizure of Tahiti. The allusion to the
Government having made a handle of this event, follows out the idea of
the pump very cleverly.

ANOTHER FINE IDEA.
R. D'Israeli asked, in the
House of Commons the other
night, with considerable energy,
“What is half a century in the
history of a nation ?”. This is
a very “fine idea,” and reminds
us of the sum proposed by an
Irish usher, who, in a fit of
arithmetical sublimity exclaim-
ed to his pupil, “365. Try and
do that if you can l’” In work-
ing out Mr. D'Israeli's pro-
blem, we are struck with its
resemblance to the glorious
query—if a red herring costs
three halfpence, what will a
sack of coals come to ? What, indeed, is half a century in
the history of a nation tº Echo-that is to say, poetical echo;
which always responds to the beginning of a sentence instead
of the end–Echo answers, “Eh! what?”
The fine idea of Mr. D'Israeli is, however, capable of
almost universal application; and we suggest the following
cases, in which it may be used with effect, quite equal to that
produced by the demand of “What is half a century in the
history of a nation t”. For example: At a meeting of the
Coal trade, what could be more splendid than the inquiry,
in a tone of eloquent sublimity, “What is half a hundred
in a ton of coals " The beauty of this idea is in its vast-
ness; and the author ought to be placed on the same pedestal
in the Temple of Fame, with that most sublime of spend-
thrifts, who, rushing to his coachmaker in Long Acre,
ordered, in a whirlwind of passionate extravagance, “Some
MoRE gigs.”
THE
HISTORY OF THE NEXT FRENCH REVOLUTION.
[From a forthcoming History of Europe.]
CHAP. III.--THE ADVANCE OF THE PRETENDERS–
HISTORICAL REVIEW.
We will now resume the narrative, and endeavour to compress, in
a few comprehensive pages, the facts which are more diffusely
described in the print from which we have quoted.
It was manifest, then, that the troubles in the departments were of a
serious nature, and that the forces gathered round the two Pretenders
to the crown were considerable. They had their supporters too in
Paris, as what party indeed has not ? and the venerable occupant
of the throne was in a state of considerable anxiety, and found his
declining years by no means so comfortable as his virtues and great
age might have warranted.
His paternal heart was the more grieved when he thought of
the fate reserved to his children, grandchildren, and great-grand-
children, now sprung up round him in vast numbers. The king's
grandson, the prince royal, married to a princess of the house of
Schlippen Schloppen, was the father of fourteen children, all hand-
somely endowed with pensions by the state. His brother, the Count
D’Eu, was similarly blessed with a multitudinous offspring. The
Duke of Nemours had no children; but the Princes of Joinville,
Aumale, and Montpensier (married to the Princesses Januaria and
Februaria, of Brazil, and the Princess of the United States of
America, erected into a monarchy, 4th July, 1856, under the
Emperor Duff Green I.), were the happy fathers of immense
families—all liberally apportioned by the Chambers, which had long
been entirely subservient to His Majesty Louis-Philippe.
The Duke of Aumale was King of Algeria, having married (in the
first instance) the Princess Badroulboudour, a daughter of his Highness
Abd-El-Kader. The Prince of Joinville was adored by the nation,
on account of his famous victory over the English fleet, under the
command of Admiral the Prince of Wales, whose ship, the Richard
Cobden, of 120 guns, was taken by the Belle-Poule frigate of 30, on
which occasion forty-five other ships of war, and seventy-nine steam
frigates, struck their colours to about one-fourth the number of the
heroic French navy. The victory was mainly owing to the gallantry
of the celebrated French Horse-marines, who executed several bril-
liant charges under the orders of the intrepid Joinville ; and though
the Irish brigade, with their ordinary modesty, claimed the honours
of the day, yet, as only three of that nation were present in the action, impartial
history must award the palm to the intrepid sons of Gaul.
With so numerous a family quartered on the nation, the solicitude of
the admirable King may be conceived, lest a revolution should ensue, and
fling them on the world once more.
family Considerable as his wealth was, (for he was known to have amassed
about a hundred and thirteen billions, which were lying in the caves of the
Tuileries,) yet such a sum was quite insignificant when divided among his
How could he support so numerous a
progeny — and, besides, he naturally preferred getting from the
nation as much as his faithful people could possibly afford.
Seeing the imminency of the danger, and that money, well applied,
is often more efficacious than the conqueror's sword, the King's
ministers were anxious that he should devote a part of his savings
to the carrying on of the war. But, with the cautiousness of age,
the monarch declined this offer; he preferred, he said, throwing him-
self upon his faithful people, who, he was sure, would meet, as became
them, the coming exigency. The Chambers met his appeal with
their usual devotion. At a solemn convocation of those legislative
bodies, the King, surrounded by his family, explained the circum-
stances and the danger. His Majesty, his family, his Ministers,
and the two Chambers, then burst into tears, according to imme-
morial usage, and raising their hands to the ceiling, swore eternal
fidelity to the dynasty and to France, and embraced each other
affectingly all round.
It need not be said that in the course of that evening two hundred
deputies of the Left left Paris, and joined the Prince John Thomas
Napoleon, who was now advanced as far as Dijon—two hundred
and fifty three (of the Right, the centre, and round the corner,)
similarly quitted the Capital to pay their homage to the Duke of
Bordeaux—they were followed, according to their several political
predilections, by the various Ministers and dignitaries of State. The
only Minister who remained in Paris was Marshal Thiers, Prince of
Waterloo; (he had defeated the English in the very field where
they had obtained formerly a success, though the victory was as
usual claimed by the Irish Brigade;) but age had ruined the
health, and diminished the immense strength of that gigantic leader,
and it is said his only reason for remaining in Paris was because a
fit of the gout kept him in bed.
The Capital was entirely tranquil. The theatres and cafés were
open as usual, and the masked balls attended with great enthusiasm
—confiding in their hundred and twenty-four forts, the fight-minded
people had nothing to fear.
Except in the way of money, the king left nothing undone to con-
ciliate his people. He even went among them with his umbrella,
but they were little touched with that mark of confidence. He shook
hands with everybody; he distributed crosses of the legion of honour
in such multitudes, that red ribband rose two hundred percent, in the
market, (by which his Majesty, who speculated in the article, cleared
a tolerable sum of money.) But these blandishments and honours
had little effect upon an apathetic people; and the enemy of the
Orleans Dynasty, the fashionable young nobles of the Henriquinquiste
party, wore gloves perpetually, for fear (they said) that they should
be obliged to shake hands with the best of kings; while the Repub-

licans adopted coats without button-holes, lest they should be forced
to hang red ribbands in them. The funds did not fluctuate in the
least.
The proclamation of the several pretenders had had their effect.
The young men of the schools and the estaminets (celebrated places
of public education) allured by the noble words of Prince. Napoleon,
“Liberty, equality, war all over the world !” flocked to his standard
in considerable numbers; while the noblesse naturally hastened to
offer their allegiance to the legitimate descendant of Saint Louis.
And truly, never was there seen a more brilliant chivalry than
that collected round the gallant Prince Henry ! There was not a
man in his army but had lacquered boots and fresh white kid gloves
at morning and evening parade. The fantastic and effeminate, but
brave and faithful troops, were numbered off into different legions—
there was the Fleur d'Orange regiment; the Eau de Rose battalion;
the violet-pomatum Volunteers; the Eau de Cologne, cavalry-
according to the different scents which they affected. Most of the
warriors wore lace ruffles; all powder and pig-tails, as in the real days
of chivalry. A band of heavy dragoons under the command of Count
Alfred de Horsay, made themselves conspicuous for their discipline,
cruelty, and the admirable cut of their coats; and with these cele-
brated horsemen came from England the illustrious Duke of Jenkins
with his superb footmen. They were all six feet high. They all
wore bouquets of the richest flowers. They wore bags, their hair
slightly powdered, brilliant shoulder-knots, and cocked hats laced
with gold. They wore the tight knee-pantaloon of velveteen, peculiar
to this portion of the British infantry; and their legs were so superb,
that the Duke of Bordeaux embracing with tears their admirable
leader on parade, said, “Jenkins, France never saw such calves until
now.” The weapon of this tremendous militia was an immense club
or cane, reaching from the sole of the foot to the nose, and heavily
mounted with gold. Nothing could withstand before this terrific
weapon, and the breastplates and plumed morions of the French
Cuirassiers would have been undoubtedly crushed beneath them, had
they ever met in mortal combat. Between this part of the Prince's
forces and the Irish auxiliaries there was a deadly animosity. Alas,
there always is such in camps | The sons of Albion had not forgotten
the day when the children of Erin had been subject to their devas-
tating sway.
The uniform of the latter was various—the rich stuff called corps-
du-roy (worn by Coeur de Lion at Agincourt) formed their lower
habiliments for the most part: the national frieze" yielded them tail
coats. The latter were generally torn in a fantastic manner at the
elbows, skirts, and collars, and fastened with every variety of button,
tape, and string. Their weapons were the caubeen, the alpeen, and
the doodeen, of the country—the latter a short but dreadful weapon
of offence. At the demise of the venerable Theobald Mathew,
the nation had laid aside its habit of temperance, and universal
intoxication betokened their grief: it became afterwards their con-
stant habit. Thus do men ever return to the haunts of their
childhood, such a power has fond memory over us! The leaders of
this host seem to have been, however, an effeminate race; they are
represented by contemporary historians as being passionately fond
of flying kites. Others say they went into battle armed with “bills,'
no doubt rude weapons; for it is stated that foreigners could never
be got to accept them in lieu of their own arms. The Princes of
Mayo, Sligo, and Connemara, marched by the side of their young
and royal chieftain, the Prince of Ballybunion, fourth son of Daniel
the First, King of the Emerald Isle;
Two hosts then, one under the Eagles, and surrounded by the
republican imperialists, the other under the antique French Lilies,
were marching on the French capital. The Duke of Brittany, too,
confined in the Lunatic Asylum of Charenton, found means to issue

capital. Such was the state of the empire, and such the clouds that
were gathering round the Sun of Orleans !
POOR-LAW DEATHS AND POOR-LAW WERDICTS.
THE ermine, it is fabled, cannot survive a spot ; let any foreign
substance soil its snowy coat, and on the instant the creature begins
to pine, and soon dies—the victim of a stain. The fiction is pretty—
is poetically typical of the most exquisite purity of that tender and
delicate animal, which gives its spotless skin wherewith to clothe
immaculate authority.
It would seem that coroners' juries entertain the same fiction as a
verity, of the mortal sensibility of the authorities and servants, from
high to low, of a Union poor-house. Hence, the frequency of those
touching reprimands fringing reported inquests. A man of ninety,
become a loathsome burthen to his fellow-men by the foulness of his
poverty, is made to render up almost his last gasp beneath a wintry sky;
as the cart jolts along the frozen, iron road, the death-rattle is in the
hoary peasant's throat; he dies; and the indignant jury, their hearts
bursting with emotion—wrung with sorrow for the cruelty of man
towards man—return a verdict of “Died by the visitation of God;”
peace-giving death being, in their opinion, accelerated by the conduct
of some poor-law officer. The functionary is visited with a heavy
reprimand; the ermine purity of his character is spotted by the ink-
drops recording the verdict; and the jury depart for their homes,
their indignation softened by the thought that they have dealt justice
on the evil-doer.
A sick infant is to be got rid of—thrust from one poor-house to
another; and the authorties of the Union, casting forth the piece of
human offal, claw from its blistered flesh the rags and flannel belong-
ing to them—yes, they are the property of the house; and, for the
child, why, that is only a thing of God's making, and, being immortal,
is not a perishable article, like linen and fleecy hosiery. The child
can only die in this world. Die it does; and again a Coroner's Jury,
“beating their pensive bosoms,” return a verdict of “Natural death.”
—still accompanying the opinion with a fatal reprimand of one of
the nurses, with a withering reflection on the skill or humanity of
the doctor.
A poor girl of fourteen, with inflammation of the pericardium and
the knee-joint, is taken in a cart to the Bridgewater Union. We
remove furniture in springed vehicles; but then mahogany and rose-
wood are of more costly materials than paupers' inflamed joints;
such things may be carried even in a tumbril; it is but a few shrieks
more or less on the part of the pauper—a few more throes of agony,
—and in a few days she dies, too—“dies,” say the Jury, “by the
visitation of God :” but then “the deceased's death was greatly
accelerated by the removal.” Here is another reprimand—another
blight of blame upon somebody. Were a carrier to knock off the
leg of a table in its removal from one place to another, no doubt
the owner of the said table could have legal remedy for the frac-
ture; the law would not simply allow him the right of reprimanding
careless Hodge ; no, Hodge (the owner of the spring-cart or van)
would be amenable for the injury either in person or pocket. But
then tables are property: paupers are other sort of chattels; and a
reprimand of those who may neglect and maltreat them, is all-sufficient
to meet the casualty. And wherefore is this Because, we doubt
not, it is a popular fallacy, that all persons, of every degree, employed
in Poor-Law Unions, have that exquisite sensibility which is poetically
feigned of the ermine. They cannot outlive a spot; a reprimand,
soiling the lustrous snowiness of their reputation, kills them. The
Jury return the inculpatory verdict; and the stained and stricken
functionary, whether a guardian or a nurse, a doctor or a matron,
fades and changes beneath the stain, and, retiring to some “untrod
corner of the earth,” dies.
Such must be the consequence in the opinion of Juries generally,
or would they content themselves with tagging their verdicts with a
meek and harmless reproach They must feel convinced that their
criminatory syllables carry a subtle power of punishment upon the
offenders they condemn, or wherefore such needless waste of whole-
some blame?
Alas ! that stubborn philosopher Bonni declared that in his own
anatomy he had never felt so cold as on the day his enemies burnt him
in effigy. We fear that sundry poor-law functionaries, with a load of
reprimand upon their shoulders, continue to eat, drink, and sleep—
and that never more comfortably than when strongly censured.
Indeed, when we consider the spirit that animates much of the

liberal benignity of Somerset House, be turned into graces. For
instance, why not give a certain ornament to a guardian, doctor, or
nurse, for every reprimand inflicted by a Jury Thus, the zealous
veteran might be distinguished by his outward trappings, even as de-
grees of military rank are made manifest. There was a Wirtemburgh
Order of the Death's Head Might not the Commissioners intro-
duce that, adding to it the Cross-Bones, as the highest mark of Poor
Law merit, for those who boast a certain number of reprimands, they
being to the Poor Law veteran what scars are to the soldier We
throw out the hint, and hope the folks at Somerset House will be
duly grateful for it.
With respect to Juries, however, we beg that they will in future
disabuse their minds of the fiction, the pretty conceit, that poor-law
servants suffer aught from a reprimand. We entreat of Juries to
reject the fallacy. The functionaries of a Union are not of the species
ermine.
ROYAL BENEVOLENCE “CORKED UP AND KEPT.”
Punch has been thrown into a state of alarm by certain paragraphs,
headed “Royal Benevolence,” in the papers. It was therein averred
that Her Majesty had ordered all the unused “cut pieces of bread”
saved from the royal table, and heretofore thrown to the pigs, should
be shared among certain of the Windsor poor. The benevolent act
was received with loyal applause on all hands. A day or two passes,
and it is then avowed that Her Majesty further orders that all the
“unused wine” from the royal board should be given to cheer the
hearts of the sick poor in the neighbourhood of the Castle. It was
this report that startled Punch. His nose, with its peculiar sensi-
bility, scented a social revolution. “What l” said he, “if Her
Majesty give away bread and wine, and that so lavishly, to the poor,
what may not be looked for from the example Benevolence like
this is infectious—such charity becomes catching ! Hence, the
Maids of Honour (dear hearts 1), the Lords and Gentlemen in
Waiting, and all the countless domestics, noble and plebeian, of
the Castle, may be impoverishing and even stripping themselves,
to enrich and clothe the destitute of Windsor. We shall hear of
salaries laid out in coals and candles—we shall see Ladies of the
Bedchamber who have sacrificed dimity and flannel petticoats at the
shrine of want : a gentleman in waiting with two coats to his back
will be rare as a civet-cat with two skins. And this furor of charity
will not stop at Windsor. Oh no there is in high life a fashion for
feelings as well as for flounces; hence, we shall very soon have a crowd
of paupers at every aristocratic door—we shall have ladies of distinc-
tion dirtying their fairy feet, and perilling their precious health, by
visits to low and loathsome alleys, taking with them all sorts of
covering for the helpless naked.” Punch had his anxious fears for the
Morning Post. That rose-coloured journal might be defiled by fashion-
able paragraphs like the following —
“Yesterday, the Countess of visited Hampshire Hog Lane,
with half-a-dozen blankets, and a sack of potatoes.”
“The Marchioness of spent a few hours in a cellar in St.
Giles's on Monday last, with the sick wife of a bricklayer, to whom
her ladyship carried linen and a ton of coals.”
“Departures.—From Portland-square, the Countess of 2
with a leg of mutton and three 41b. loaves, for Tothill-fields.”
“From May-Fair, the Lady of the Bishop of , and her
lovely and benevolent daughters, with three sides of bacon, a dozen
of wine, mattresses, and baby-linen, for Seven Dials.”
Such notices as these, thought Punch, may astonish and perplex
the world, and the social revolution, to the regret of many wise and
excellent people, be complete. Happily, the fears of Punch were
dispelled by the Times of the 29th ult, for, again, under the head of
“Royal Benevolence,” we learn that the story of all the unused wine
being given to the poor was a benevolent flam. No such thing !
Thus it is :—
“The whole of the unconsumed wine at the Royal table, which is of the most choice
description, is regularly conveyed back to the cellur, then carefully corked up and kept
in readiness for the following day's consumption, and again placed on the Royal table.
The misstatement probably originated with respect to the refuse wine in the steward's room,
which is left in the decanters at the table after dinner and supper; wine being allowed to
the pages and upper servants in the proportion of two bottles to three men, and one pint
to each woman, per diem. This refuse wine, on the whole about a bottle or so, which
was formerly the perquisites of the waiters or pages' men, is now given away to the poor
on proper application being made to the Deputy Controller of Her Majesty's Household.”
On reading this, Punch breathed again—society was safe. The whole
of the wine devoted to the sick poor of Windsor is, in fact, nothing
but the “heel-taps” of the pages and upper servants—the said taps
being heretofore the rightful perquisites of the menials' menials, who
are thus made the bonā fide subscribers to the sick paupers of Windsor.
Not a drop comes from the Queen's table. No, what we thought the
royal charity, bubbling and glowing from a hundred bottles, is “care-
fully corked up.” The sick poor of Windsor have wine, that is,
“about a bottle or so.” per diem shared among them, and rendered up
by the lacqueys of Windsor palace . We trust that this example
will not be lost upon all fortunate wine-bibbers of every rank through-
out the kingdom ; for, though they may not be disposed to give a
drop of the generous fluid to their neighbouring poor, they may,
copying in its spirit the great-hearted benevolence of Windsor, at
least permit the wretches to—smell the corks.

CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
PUNCH TO SIR ROBERT PEEL.
SIR. Robert PEEL,
In the Times of the 29th ult, MR. TuRNER is reported to have
asked you whether Her Majesty's Government intended to bring in a bill
for the more effectual suppression of duelling ; and you, in reply to this
uestion, are reported to have answered, in your place in the House of
mmons, in the negative.
You are further reported to have said that you “ thought that Her
Majesty's Government had sufficiently evinced their willingness to exert
their legitimate power and influence against the practice of duelling.”
Furthermore you are reported, in exemplification of your own and your
colleagues' willingness to suppress duelling, to have spoken to the effect
following:—
“Colonel Fawcett was a man of great military reputation, and had
distinguished himself in the service of his country. He was unfortunately
killed in a duel, and when his widow applied for that pension to which she
would have been entitled had he lost his life in any other way than by the
hand of his adversary, Her Majesty's Government felt themselves com-
pelled to refuse to grant that pension.”
In the said Times, of the date aforesaid, it is likewise alleged that MR.
Smith, your Attorney-General for Ireland, did, in his place in open Court,
deliver to MR. Fitzgibbon, one of the opposing counsel on the trial of
DANIEL O'Connell, a challenge to fight a duel, and that you have not only
taken no notice of the conduct of the said SMITH, but have rather made
much of him, as of one who has done the state service.
Having asserted these facts, the Times proceeds to comment on them in
a manner by no means complimentary to you ; and if the facts were true,
you would not only deserve all that it said of you, but, I will candidly tell
you, a great deal more.
But surely the facts cannot be true. The Times for once has been
hoaxed ; “Aliquando bonus”—but you are a classic, Sir Robert, and I need
not complete the quotation.
What I Can I believe, in the first place, that you said that the
Ministry, of which you are at the head, had no intention of bringing in a
bill to prevent duelling, when such a bill is so much wanted, and whereas
it would be so easy to frame one Is it not obvious that a law which
made any one guilty of sending a challenge, fighting a duel, or being in
any way a party to either transaction, liable to be sent for six months to
the treadmill, would have the desired effect. Am I to think you an ass,
SiR Robert PEEL 1 Pooh 1 You took honours at Oxford.
In the next place, will any one tell me that you allowed a barrister,
whose business was wrangling, whose profession must have habituated
him to give and take insults, and for whom, therefore, provocation was
a trumpery excuse, to commit—attempt to commit, at least, which comes
to the same thing—such a crime as that imputed to MR. SMITH, with utter
impunity, and at the same time visited the like offence in a soldier on the
person of his poor widow Nonsense ! Putting the widow out of the
question, is it possible that you could permit a lawyer to break the law
which he had no vocation to break, without animadversion even ; and
dream of punishing an officer for a crime which, under military regu-
lations, for whose maintenance you are responsible, is actually in the way
of his business? Stuff! When, too, the officer was one who had fought
and bled for his country, and the lawyer, merely a political partisan!
Fiddle-de-dee I would not believe you guilty of such villanous par-
tiality, such inconsistent meanness, for a moment.
But, to think that you, with such an opportunity of discountenacing a
great wickedness presented you, as its public perpetration by an officer of
the Crown, should have neglected it, to inflict a vicarious punishment on
an unfortunate lady, whose situation claimed your every sympathy, is
monstrous. You could have done no such thing, and even could you have
been so base, surely the Duke of WellingtoN, recollecting his affair
with LoRD WINchelsea, never would have agreed to it.
SiR Robert PEEL, I will not, I cannot believe that you have acted the
part which has been ascribed to you. Why, in a melodrame, at the Sur-
rey Theatre, had an unjust Vizier behaved in such a manner, the gallery
would have cried “Yah!” upon him. Forgive me one quotation, not
classical, but to the point. “The man who could injure a defenceless
female is unworthy the name of a Briton.”
I have been daily expecting to see a letter from you to the Times, deny-
ing the charges contained in it. But self-confident innocence, the “mens
conscia recti"—you know what that means, SIR Robert, has restrained
you, I suppose. I do not believe those charges; but other people do ;
wherefore have I felt called upon thus to step forward in your vin-
dication.

The drizzling rain, that set from the North East directly into the eye of

nately already wet through. On opening them, however, the facts they
were found to contain were all of the driest character. At Isleworth the

HISTORY OF THE NEXT FRENCH REVOLUTION.
[From a forthcoming History of Europe.]
CHAP. IV.-THE BATTLE OF RHEIMS.
It was not the first time that the king had had to undergo misfor-
tunes; and now, as then, he met them like a man. The Prince of
Joinville was not successful in his campaign against the Imperial
Pretender; and that bravery which had put the British fleets to flight,
was found, as might be expected, insufficient against the irresistible
courage of native Frenchmen. The Horse Marines, not being on their
own element, could not act with their usual effect. Accustomed to the
tumult of the swelling seas, they were easily unsaddled on terra firma,
and in the Champagne country. -
It was literally in the Champagne country that the meeting between
the troops under Joinville and Prince Napoleon took place; for both
armies had reached Rheims, and a terrific battle was fought under-
neath the walls. For some time nothing could dislodge the army of
Joinville, entrenched in the champagne cellars of Messrs. Ruinart,
Moët, and others; but making too free with the fasci-
nating liquor, the army at length became entirely drunk;
on which the Imperialists, rushing into the cellars, had
an easy victory over them ; and, this done, proceeded
to intoxicate themselves likewise.
The Prince of Joinville, seeing the déroute of his
troops, was compelled with a few faithful followers to
fly towards Paris, and Prince Napoleon remained master
of the field of battle. It is needless to recapitulate the
bulletin which he published the day after the occasion,
so soon as he and his secretaries were in a condition
to write. Eagles, pyramids, rainbows, the Sun of Auster-
litz, &c. figured in the proclamation, in close imitation
of his illustrious uncle. But the great benefit of the
action was this : on arousing from their intoxication,
the late soldiers of Joinville kissed and embraced their
comrades of the Imperial army, and made common cause
with them.
“Soldiers!” said the Prince, on reviewing them the
second day after the action, “The Cock is a gallant
bird ; but he makes way for the Eagle your colours are
not changed. Ours floated on the walls of Moscow—
yours on the ramparts of Constantine; both are glorious.
Soldiers of Joinville ! we give you welcome, as we would
welcome your illustrious leader, who destroyed the fleets
of Albion. Let him join us ! We will march together
against that perfidious enemy -
“But, Soldiers! intoxication dimmed the laurels of yesterday's
glorious day! Let us drink no more of the fascinating liquors of our
native Champagne. Let us remember Hannibal and Čapua; and,
before we plunge into dissipation, that we have Rome still to
conquer |
“Soldiers Seltzer water is good after too much drink. Wait
a while, and your Emperor will lead you into a Seltzer-water country.
Frenchmen l it lies BEYon I THE RHINE | *
Deafening shouts of “Vice l’Empereur ! ” saluted this allusion of
the Prince, and the army knew that their natural boundary should
be restored to them. The compliments to the gallantry of the
Prince of Joinville likewise won all hearts, and immensely advanced
the Prince's cause. The Journal des Débats did not know which way
to turn. In one paragraph it called the Emperor “a sanguinary
tyrant, murderer, and pickpocket;” in a second it owned he was
“a magnanimous rebel, and worthy of forgiveness;” and, after
proclaiming “the brilliant victory of the Prince of Joinville,”
presently denominated it a “funeste journée.”
The next day the Emperor, as we may now call him, was about
to march on Paris, when Messrs. Ruinart and Moët were presented,
and requested to be paid for 300,000 bottles of wine. “Send three
hundred thousand more to the Tuileries,” said the Prince, sternly;
“our soldiers will be thirsty when they reach Paris;” and taking
Moët with him as a hostage, and promising Ruinart that he would

have him shot unless he obeyed—with trumpets playing and eagles
glancing in the sun, the gallant Imperial army marched on their
triumphant way.
Lord Brougham’s Privy Council Amendment Bill.
We are happy to be able to present to our readers a copy of the rough sketch
which Lord Brougham drew out when he first jotted down is notions of this
measure. . These notions were, of course, not intended for public inspection;
but, as giving an insight into the workings of the actice mind of the ex-
Chancellor, the document will, we are sure, prote acceptable.
MEMS. FOR A BiLL.
&bereas it is desirable to amend a certain Act, (Insert here the
usual humbug about “better despatch of business,” and extension of
jurisdiction).
BE IT ENACTED, &c.—(Come at once to the expediency of appointing
me, not mentioning me exactly by name, Permanent President in the
absence of the President of the Council).
AND BE IT FURTHER ENAct ED, by and with, &c.—(Bring in
here the arrangement about the salary, which must be at feast
£2000 a year).
AND Whereas, -(Provide here for the salary being in addition to
any retiring pension at present enjoyed by the intended new Judge.
Remember to be very particular about that).
Be it also Funt HER ENAct ED,-(Here insert a clause appointing
two more salaried judges in addition to the chief, as a sop to other
legal expectants).
AND BE IT Funt HER ENActed,—(Put in something here that the
Bill is supposed to do, besides merely making a new Judge.)
AND when EAs, (Insert here a specimen of some grievance in the
present state of the law, which this new Act is supposed to be
intended to remedy).
BE IT Also ENActed,—(Throw in something to give the Act a
popular aspect—the idea of lessening the expense of divorce does
not seem bad. Mem.—Cheap literature has answered pretty well—
why should not cheap divorce go down It's something new at
all events. Try it.)
AND BE IT ENAct ED,-(Bring in the usual finale about altering
or amending the Act in the present Session).
Conversion of the Three-and-a-Etalfs.
The contemplated conversion of the Three-and-a-Halfs has already
thrown the money market into sixes and sevens. The Bears and the
Bulls are down on all-fours; and the result is so doubtful, that it is quite
a toss up with the Bulls whether they will come out losers by the trans-
action. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also contemplates the conver-
sion of the short sixes into long fours, for he has found from experience
that the fours give a much better light, and the sixes will consequently
be gradually extinguished. It is generally believed that the conversion
of the Three-and-a-Halfs is preliminary to the abolition of the Income
Tax. It might as well be said that the invasion of England by the
Romans was preliminary to the introduction of rail-roads.

A DREAM.
sºlº
'Twas night: the Globe was folded up,
(The paper, not the earth,)
And to its proper shelf restored
The fairest “ Maid of Perth : ”
But till with strange intricacy
The things that I had read—
The Irish News, the Scottish Tale—
Kept running in my head ;
While over all a sort of mist
Began to slowly creep,
The twilight haze of Thought before
It darkens into Sleep ;
A foggy land where shady shapes
Kept stirring in the gloom,
Till with a hint of brighter tint
One spot began to bloom,
And on the blank, by dreamy prank,
I saw a Figure tall,
As vivid as from painted glass,
Projected on a wall !
The face, as well as I could trace,
Two sparkling eyes were there,
Black as the beard, and trim moustache,
And curly head of hair;
The nose was straight, the mouth was large,
The lips disclosed beneath
A set full white and regular
Of strong and handsome teeth—
The whiter, that his brow, and cheek,
And thick uncover'd gorge,
Were ruddy as if baked by heat
Of sun or glowing forge.
His dress was buff, or some such stuff,
And belted at the waist;
A curious dirk, for stabbing work,
Was in the girdle placed,
Beside a sort of pouch or purse
Of some wild creature's skin,
To safely hold his store of gold
Or silver coin therein 5–
But—suddenly his doublet changed
To one of brighter hue,
A jerkin fair and superfine
Of cloth of azure blue,
Slash'd front and back with satin black,
Embroider'd o'er, and laced
With sable silk, as used to suit
The ancient time and taste ;
His hose were of the Flemish eut,
His boots of cordovan;
A velvet bonnet on his head
Like that of Scottish man,—
Nay, not a velvet one,—for why,
As dreams are apt to deal,
º -
*\S.
\\
With sudden change, as swift as strange,
It shone a cap of steel !
His coat of buff, or azure stuff,
Became a hauberk bright,
No longer gay in his array,
But harness'd for the Fight 1
Huge was his frame, and muscular,
Indicative of strength :
His bosom broad, his ". arms
Of more than common length ;
And well the sturdy limbs might be
So sinewy, stark, and strong,
That had to wield in battle-field
A sword so broad and long 1
Few men there were of mortal mould,
Although of warlike trade,
But had been rash to stand the clash
Of that tremendous blade;
And yet aloft he swung it oft,
As if of feather-weight,
And cut amid the empty air,
A monstrous figure eight;
Whilst ever as it cleft the wind,
A whisper came therewith,
That low and clear said in my ear,
“Behold the Fighting Smith !” -
And lo! another “change came o'er
The spirit of my dream :”
The hauberk bright no longer shone
With that metallic gleam—
No ruddy visage furnace-scorched,
With glowing eyes, was there,
Nor sable beard, nor trim moustache,
Nor head of raven hair;
No steely cap, with plume mayhap,
No bonnet small or big;
Upon his brow there settled now,
A curly powder'd Wig 1
Beneath his chin two cambric bands
Demurely drooped adown;
And from his brawny shoulders hung
A black forensic gown.
No mail beneath, to guard from death,
Or wounds in battle dealt,
Nor ready dirk for stabbing work,
Dependent at his belt—
His right hand bore no broad claymore,
But, with a flourish, soon
He wav'd a Pistol huge enough
For any horse-dragoon,
And whilst he pointed to and fro,
As if to aim therewith,
Still in my ear, the voice was clear,
“Behold the Fighting Smith 1” +
* Wide Scott’s “Fair Maid of Perth.”
* Wide “The State Trials in Ireland.”
INDIAN INTELLIGENCE.
LoRD ELLENBorough's despatches are written
in a strain that show him to be capable of higher
and better things; or, in other words, we think
he is quite competent to dramatise the Indian
War for Astley's. The style of his writing ap-
pears to be eminently calculated for making a
“strong bill,” as the phrase goes, for the Royal
Amphitheatre, Westminster Bridge. We are
confident that his Excellency could pen one of
the most effective spectacles ever known, which
would induce George Almar, Esq., the dramatist-
in-ordinary to Mr. Batty, to hide his diminished
cranium in the very first property helmet that
he could contrive to thrust it into.
We suggest a few of the principal clap-traps
which we are convinced that Lord Ellenborough
would write, with a just appreciation of their
capability to bring down at least “three rounds”
from the boxes, pit, and gallery.
A Speech for a General.—Soldiers! Remember
that the honour of the British lion is this day
entrusted to your hands; and the British unicorn
is looking down, from his proud position in the
royal arms, to watch the progress of this day's
action. Let it never be said that an English
bayonet had reason to blush for the hand that
bore it. Onwards! Follow your leaders : Re-
member, I am at your back. Your General
bids you forward 1 I will watch your daring
deeds from yonder hill. My heart is with you.
Fancy that I am leading you on ; while I bring
i. as near to my eye as you are close to my
eart, through the safe and convenient medium
of my Dollond's telescope. (The troops rush
towards the foe. The General erit hurriedly to
his quarters.)
A Speech for a Lieutenant.—Let me seek the
thickest of the fight. My Matilda is faithless t
my overdrawn bills are in the hands of one
more formidable than the foe! Away ! To
death or bankruptcy
A Speech for one of the Band with a trom-
bone.—Keep off, I say, you fellow with the
scymitar. (Blowing a nate on his Trombone.
The Enemy strikes at him.) What, you would,
would you ! (Drawing out the trombone to its
full length in the face of the Indian.) Oh! I
thought I should get the best of it. (The Enemy
raises a loud whoop, as if suffering from pain by
the blow from the trombone.) Serves you right.
I knew you'd get the worst of it. (Ereunt
opposite sides: the Indian brandishing his scymi-
tar, the other playing very loud notes on his
trombone, with a look of defiance.)
These are a few of the points which we think
might be made by the noble Governor-General,
if he would condescend to give us his own dra-
matic version of the War in India. Though
very well done last year at Astley's, it might
have been managed better, though the notion of
telling the plot, by one of the characters nar-
rating the history of what had taken place to his
horse, was a happy one that cannot be matched
very easily. Perhaps it would be a good idea for
one of the characters to apostrophise his sword
something in this style, in order to let the audi-
ence into the story of the drama.
“You know, my faithful sword, that I ex-
changed vows of unalterable affection with
Matilda under the walls of Jellelabad. You
know also, my honest weapon, for you were at
that moment at my side, that when in the heat
of action I thought only of her. You know,
also, my trusty blade, that her father never
would consent to our union. But why should I
say all this to you? How can you feel? You
that are nothing but steel. Well, well, my
sword, you are no worse than the rest of the
world, for I have known hearts of steel as well
as weapons. Back, back to your scabbard–cold
and cutting as thou art. Thou wearest no
mask, like some : but—no matter.”—(Weeps
and erit.)

PRINCE ALBERT'S CONTEMPLATED TOUR.
We have received the following letter from “the most distin-
guished personage,” on the subject of the paragraph that appeared in
Monday's Times. We print the communication without comment.
Buckingham Palace.
THE QUEEN directs the attention of Punch to the following very
mischievous paragraph which appeared in the Times, and to which
Her Majesty requests that Punch will give—on authority—a direct
contradiction.
“We understand that His Royal Highness Prince Albert is going, during
the Easter recess, to make a short excursion to the Continent.”
The QUEEN is sure that Punch, with his customary acuteness, will
see the dangerous tendency of the above, which is calculated to
unsettle the mind of a young man, and fill his head with notions
which can only lead to ultimate disappointment.
3|alm amb 31 umarp.
AN attempt was made the other day to set aside, on the ground of
insanity, the will of a party who had left 4500l. to be laid out in erecting a
statue of himself on horseback. The law, which always looks favourably
on foolery, held that this equestrian statue was no pretext for taking out
what is sometimes called a statue of lunacy. If the erection of equestrian
figures be a mark of insanity, where are the madmen that have recently
stuck up the eyesore in Trafalgar Square : The Court, however, very
properly determined that a man may leave a large sum of money to erect
an equestrian statue of himself without his will being vitiated by the cir-
cumstance. In order, however, that persons with this propensity may
know how far they may safely go, we subjoin a table, according to which
almost any one may be guided, if he will place himself under one of the
various classes of which the men named below are specimens.
Lord Brougham, being a nonsuch, might, without suspicion of any
unusual lunacy, bequeath £50,000 for a statue of himself riding on four
horses at once, to be named, Tory, Whig, Radical, and Quackery.
Mr. Daniel O'Connell might, without suspicion of particular lunacy,
bequeath for a statue of himself, on a Hobby named Repeal, the quarter's
rint next immediately following his dissolution.
Mr. D'Israéli might leave, without any suspicion of lunacy, ten pounds
for a statue of Young England—typified by a white waistcoat, mounted
on a richly-caparisoned clothes-horse.
Mr. Peter Borthwick might leave, without suspicion of lunacy, his whole
estate to be invested in a portrait of himself, which could be made eques-
trian to a certain extent, by hanging it, when done, across a towel-horse.
Colonel Sibthorpe might be supposed sane, were he to order in his will
that a sum of 20,000l. should be devoted to an equestrian statue of
himself, mounted on a rocking-horse, being typical of his parliamentary
career, during which he has always been making motions, but never
ettin
g Such are a few of the bequests which might be made in perfect con-
formity with the sanity of the testator; and we might perhaps add that
Punch intends leaving the profits of his very last number (if the legacy
would not be void for remoteness) to the erection of a statue of Sir Peter
Laurie on horseback, with the figure of Mr. M'Adam behind him.
A CARD.
SIR Ronent PEEL AND Go. beg respectfully to acquaint their Friends
and the Public, that they have just CoMMENCED Business as GENERAL
Dealers and WAREHouseMEN, at their Establishment, 14, Downing Street,
where Goods of all Descriptions may be purchased at the most reasonable
terms. In particular, they invite attention to their Large Stock of
PLAIN AND FANcy Stationery, including their Stamped WRITING PAPER,
each Sheet of which, being marked with their Government Stamp, may
be sent, Postage FREE, to any part of the Kingdom, by which means
Envelopes are superseded, and the tedious process of wetting rendered
unnecessary.
*...* Marine Stores, Soap for Exportation, Patent Medicines, Tea,
Coffee, Tobacco, Pepper, Outfits to India, and Funerals furnished at a
low figure.
SLY SARCASM IN A TITLE.
Ainsworth's Magazine for this month contains two articles that really
seem as if the one had been suggested by the other. The first article is
the continuation of another “New Historical Romance,” by the Editor;
and the second is sarcastically called “When to leave off.” We
wonder Mr. Ainsworth allows personalities of this obvious nature.
THE EXCLUSIVE WORKHOUSE.
So admirably has the New Poor Law operated in the prevention of pau- -
perism, and so satisfactory has been its influence on the poor themselves,
in alleviating their sufferings, endearing them to their benefactors, the
rich, and diffusing among them a spirit of subordination and content, that
Government, we understand, is meditating an extension of its principle
for the benefit of the younger sons, ruined spendthrifts, and portionless
daughters of the superior classes. Exclusive Workhouses are to be pro-
vided as places of refuge for the destitute aristocracy.
Arrangements strictly corresponding to those of the union workhouse,
but modified in accordance with the quality of the inmates, will regulate
these establishments. The diet will be as simple as a refined palate can
bear, and limited rigidly to that quantity which will just suffice for the
maintenance of genteel existence. The dress of both sexes will be plain
and respectable, such as a gentleman or lady would be rather ashamed to
be seen in, and no superfluous comforts, amusements, or accommodations
will be allowed. In fine, the Exclusive Workhouse will be divested of all
inducements which might tempt a person of fashionable ideas to wish to
enter it.
For breakfast, plain bread and butter at discretion will be allowed, with
tea or coffee and sugar; but no eggs, ham, tongue, anchovies, chocolate,
or any other more palatable articles of food. This meal will take place
at nine precisely.
Dinner, which will be served at three, will consist of a plain joint, roast
or boiled, with bread, potatoes, and the ordinary garden vegetables;
neither soup, nor fish, nor game of any description, even when sent as
presents, allowed to be dressed. The joint to be followed by a plain tart
or pudding of the fruit in season. The repast to conclude with bread and
cheese, which latter is to be good common Stilton or Cheshire, exclusive
of all Gruyère, Parmesan, or Neufchâtel. No omelettes, macaroni, or
any foreign or made dishes to be permitted. Sherry to be allowed during
dinner, and port afterwards, and table ale or porter to those who wish for
them. Every gentleman at dinner to be limited to two glasses of sherry,
and every lady to one. . After dinner the gentlemen to have three glasses
of port apiece, and the ladies two ; and each individual to be entitled to
a captain's biscuit ; no other dessert. The above to be the only wines
suffered in the workhouse, and all persons convicted of smuggling in hock,
champagne, burgundy, or any other description of liquors than those pro-
vided, to be punished by solitary confinement.
Tea, same as breakfast, at seven. No other meal.
The dress of the gentlemen is to consist of a blue coat, with plain cloth
buttons, black waistcoat, and pepper-and-salt kerseymere trousers, with
Wellington boots, not of patent leather. No gentleman to wear moustaches.
Ladies dresses to be of good mousseline-de-laine, of a simple and uniform
pattern, cotton stockings, without open work, and black morocco shoes,
unsandalled. No lady to be adorned with any trinket beyond her wedding-
ring ; and no gentleman to appear with a watch-guard or an eye-glass.
Husbands and wives to be compelled to live together; but the separa-
tion of parent from child to be strictly enforced.
Gentlemen are to be expressly interdicted from the use of snuff and
cigars; and no lady to be indulged with smelling-salts or vinaigrettes,
except by medical order. The ladies, also, will be forbidden to wear or
carry bouquets. All novels, newspapers, magazines, and works of fiction
to be excluded. No billiards to be permitted. Any lady caught waltzing
to be punished.
The employment of the ladies to consist in fancy or ornamental needle-
work; in making copies of paintings and drawings; the sale of the
articles manufactured to be applied to the support of the establishment.
The gentlemen to be employed in penmanship ; as the drawing up of
official documents, and the like. Those capable of literary exertion to
be allowed to write articles, and compose poetry and jokes, also saleable,
on behalf of the establishment, to the proprietors of Puneh and others.
Ladies or gentlemen refusing to work to be confined to their own
apartments. Each person to have a bedroom and sitting-room, but no
more. Plain brown Windsor soap and water to be the sole adjuncts to
the toilet, to the exclusion of all Circassian cream, Kalydor, Rondeletia,
and all other pomades and perfumes.
The children to be kept in a separate part of the establishment, and to
be instructed, under the auspices of competent persons, in literature, the
sciences, morality, music, and dancing.
Further particulars will transpire when the Bill for the purpose in-
tended is brought before Parliament, which will be shortly.
---
PUNch’s ReMEDY FOR LATE HOUR8.
MR. W. WILLIAMs, though defeated in his proposition to begin no
important business after twelve o'clock, has the remedy, to a certain
extent, in his own hands. Let him begin by postponing all his own
motions until after midnight. By this arrangement, also, the sleep of
members would be less likely to be broken in upon.

Th; morning wind was northerly,
The morning sky was fair,
Our noble Prince would hunting ride
To chase the flying hare;
So, breakfast done, to Windsor Park
Prince Albert took his way;
Our gracious Queen went after him,
At home she would not stay.
A prancing courser, sable steed,
The gallant Prince bestrode ;
And in her pony phaëton
The Queen behind him rode.
A handsome little chaise and pair
Roll'd gently after that;
Therein, three maids of honour, and
An Irish baron sat.
Then Anson came, and Bouverie,
And General Wemyss also ;
Four scarlet-coated courtiers next,
On horseback, in a row.
“Yo-hoicks 1” they whisper'd; “Tally-ho t”
And, “Forward to the Park 1"
While close behind their horses' heels,
The Royal hounds did bark.
It was a pack of beagle breed,
Unto the back-bone staunch,
So short and crooked in the leg,
So full about the paunch.
Six huntsmen and a whipper-in,
In line, brought up the rear;
Right stout yeomen, well fed, I ween,
On Royal beef and beer.
Each stalwart huntsman, at his waist
His bugle-horn did bear;
His shoulder bore a canvas bag,
Which held a goodly hare.
Hark follow o'er the gravel path,
Hark follow o'er the green;
Hark follow to the Royal chase
With Albert and the Queen 1
Thus rode they to the hunting ground,
Three hundred yards, or so,
There the first huntsman op'd his bag
And let the first hare go.
Upon her track the beagles, soon
As they the scent had found,
Pursued, as fast as they could put
Their little legs to ground.
“Tantivy "good Prince Albert cried,
“Who’s first to follow me tº
Then spurr'd his steed; fast after him
Drove all the company.
There ran a fence full three feet high,
Athwart the hunting ground ;
Full at the same bold Albert went,
And clear'd it with a bound.
Him follow'd Anson, General Wemyss,
And likewise Bouverie,
And one brave courtier ; but, alack 1
Down went the other three.
The carriages, perforce, were stopp'd,
They could no further go ;
Then loudly laugh'd the Irish Lord;—
He should not have done so.

Upon the Sovereign's gracious ear
The sound unseemly broke,
“My lord, my lord,” then said our Queen,
“I pray thee, what's the joke "
“Qch HI was thinking—could the boys
Of Tipperary see
Me hunting in a one-horse chay –
An’t plase your Majesty.”
Ere this was said, the hare was slain,
Prince Albert at the death;
Another then they started; first,
However, taking breath.
The rails and fences that were leapt,
They may not here be said;
Full many a hunter had a fall,
Not one a broken head.
Twice two fine hares, and one beside,
Were slaughter'd on that day:
For though twice three were started, one
Contrived to get away.
Six hares alive were taken out,
Each in its canvas sack;
And five, as dead as mutton, in
The same were.carried back.
The chase began at half-past ten,
'Twas o'er by half-past one;
The Queen and Prince went home to lunch
As soon as it was done.
Long life unto our noble Queen,
And to our Prince also :
This was the hunt in Windsor Park;
Yo-hoicks, sing tally ho!

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
Charter. The SEVENTEENTH...-OF. GUARDIAN AND WARD.
GUARDIAN is a sort of temporary parent to a
minor,-a kind of tarpaulin thrown over
the orphan to shield him from the storms of
life during his infancy—or, if we may use
an humbler illustration, a guardian is a kind
of umbrella, put up by the law over the
ward, to keep off the pelting of the pitiless
storm till the years of discretion are ar-
rived at. There are various kinds of
guardians, such as guardians by nature,
, and guardians for nurture, who are of
course the parents of the child; for if an
estate be left to an infant, the father is guardian, and must account for
the profits; but as the father can control the child's arithmetical studies,
it is easy for the latter to be brought up in blessed ignorance of accounts,
and thus the parent may easily mystify the child when the profits of the
estate are to be accounted for. The mother is the guardian for nurture;
that is to say, she is expected to nurse the infant, and the law being very
fond of children requires the mother to look to the infantine wardrobe. It
also invests her with absolute power over the milk and water, and the
bread and butter, making her a competent authority
—from which there is no appeal—on all points of
nursery practice.
Next comes the guardian in socage—so called,
perhaps, from the quaint notion that guardianship
generally extends to those who wear socs—or socks
—which is further borne out by the fact that guardian-
ship in e ceases when the child is fourteen years
old—which is about the age when socks are relin-
quished in favour of stockings. These guardians in
socage are such as cannot inherit an estate to which
a child is entitled, for Coke says that to commit the
custody of an infant to him who is next in succession,
is “quasi agnum committere lupo,” to hand over the
lamb to the wolf, and thus says Fortescue, in one of
those rascally puns for which the old jurists were
infamous, “the law, wishing the child to escape from
the lupo has left a loop-hole to enable him to do so.”
Selden has cleared this pun of a good deal of its
ambiguity by changing the word lupo into loop-ho,
but Chitty and all the later writers are utterly silent
regarding it.
By the 12th of Charles II. confirmed by 1st Victoria,
any father may appoint, by will, a guardian to his child
till the latter is twenty-one ; but it is twenty to one
whether such a guardian—called a testamentary guar-
dian—will be able to exercise proper controul over the
infant.
Guardians in chivalry have been abolished, and so
have the guardians of the night, who on the lucus a
non lucendo principle, were called watchmen, from the
fact of their never watching.
The Lord Chancellor is the general guardian of all
infants, and especially of idiots and lunatics, for as
Chancery drives people mad, it is only right that
Chancery should take care of those who are afflicted
with insanity, and who may be called the natural
offspring of equity.
aving disposed of the guardians, let us come to
the wards, or, as Coke would say, “having got rid of
the wolf, let us discuss the lamb in an amicable spirit.”
A male at twelve years of age may take the oath of
allegiance; but this does not apply to all males, for the
Hounslow mail can take nothing but two insides and the letters. At fourteen
a boy may marry if he can find any one fool enough to have him ; and at
twenty-one he may dispose of his property, so that he may throw himself
away seven years sooner than he can throw away his money. By the law of
England a girl may be given in marriage at seven, but surely this must mean
the hour of the day at which she may be married, and not the age at which
the ceremony may be performed. Formerly, children might make their
wills at fourteen, but as they could not be expected to have a will of their
own, it has been enacted that no will made by a person under twenty-one
shall be valid. Among the Greeks and Romans, women were never of age,
and if they had their way in this country a good many of them never would
be. This law must have been the civil law, for its consideration towards the
fair sex on a matter of so much delicacy as a question of age betokens
extreme civility. When this wore away, the Roman law was so civil as to
regard them as infants till they were five-and-twenty—which was meeting
the ladies half-way by treating them as little innocents for the first quarter
of a century of their precious existences.
Infants have various privileges, such as the common law privilege of
jumping over the posts at the corners of the streets, and playing at hop-
scotch or rounders in retired neighbourhoods. Another infantine
privilege is the juvenile amusement of going to law, which a child may
do by his guardian or his prochein amy, or next friend—though, by the
bye, he must be a pretty friend who would help another into a law-suit.
A child may certainly be hanged at fourteen, and certainly may not be
hanged at seven, but the intermediate period is one of doubt whether the
infant culprit is hangable. Hale gives two instances of juvenile execu-
tions in which two infant prodigies were the principal characters. One
was a girl of thirteen, who was burned for killing her mistress; and the
other a boy still younger, who, after murdering one of his companions by
a severe hiding, proceeded to hide himself, and was declared in legal
language, doli capar—up to snuff—or, to follow the Norman jurists, en
haut du tabao, and hanged accordingly. It is a fine maxim of the English
law, that an infant shall not lose by laches, or, in other words, that the
stern old doctrine of no askee no havee does not apply to a child who is
entitled to something which he neglects asking for.
An infant cannot bind himself, but he may be “stitched in a neat
wrapper”—that is to say, a Tweedish wrapper—at his own cost, if he
thinks proper to go and pay ready money for it. An infant cannot convey
away his own estate, but he may run through his own property as fast as
he likes, for if he has a field he may run across it—in at one end and out
at the other—whenever he feels disposed for it. An infant trustee may
convey an estate that he holds in trust for another person, though he may
not be a party in a conveyance on his own account, yet he may, neverthe-
An infant
less, join a party in a public conveyance, such as an omnibus.
may present a clerk to the Bishop, but if the Bishop don't like the clerk,
he may turn upon his heel; but still the presentation does not fall by
lapse into the laps of the Bishop. An infant may bind himself for neces-
saries, such as food and physic; thus, if he gives a draft to pay for a pill,
or contracts with a butcher to supply what is requisite and meet, he will
be clearly liable.
In weighing the disabilities and privileges of infants, we come to the
conclusion, that, to every six of one, there will be about half-a-dozen of
the other.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SIR ROBERT AND NICHOLAS.
A FEw days since SIR Rohent PEEL dined with the merchants of
the Russia Company. Praise of the Emperor Nicholas came, as a
matter of course, with the dessert. The buyers of hides, hemp and
tallow considered Nicholas to be the very pattern of kingly mag-
nanimity, and their potentate, more familiarly known as Nick,
would have been equally lauded had he worn the crown of Muscovy.
Praise of Nicholas, the butcher of Poland, the merciless tyrant of
the Jews, was the order of the day, and the Prime Minister
showed that, in the way of adulation, he could earn his dinner.
Speaking of the late visit of the Grand Duke Michael, the bland
Sir Robert said—
“I do *:: that the account which his Imperial Highness will give of us, after twenty-
five years' absence in Russia, will induce a yet more illustrious member of that house—
the Emperor of Russia himself—again to visit this country – (Loud cheers) and to receive
from us, within these walls, the cordial demonstration we will then offer to his Majesty
of respect for His PERsonal character and the elevated station he occupies, and of
the desire every Englishman must entertain to cement with him the feelings and senti-
ments of mutual good understanding.”
Yes, respect for “the personal character" of the Emperor
Nicholas—the ruthless man, whom it is sometimes the best charity
to believe mad. Yet Sin Rob ERT PEEL would gladden the eyes of
Englishmen with a show of the Russian Autocrat. But he will not
come—not he. We only wish he would ; then would we advise, out
of respect “for his personal character,” that he should have a guard
of honour composed of Polish refugees, and an offering from English
Jews—a dinner in the Minories.
BANKRUPTCY EXTRAORDINARY.
THE bankrupt, Felix Cool, was opposed by a learned barrister on
behalf of several creditors. The debts were very unimportant to every
one but the creditors, amounting only to a few thousand pounds; and the
assets were of that nature that the time of the assignees would not be
wasted in collecting them.
Sir C. F. Williams said, this was so far favourable to the bankrupt, for
he had evidently set an example of punctuality in receiving all he earned,
though, in paying all he owed, the same business-like exactitude, had,
unfortunately, not been exhibited. There was one thing, however, that
he, (Sir C. F. Williams,) would take the liberty of asking the bankrupt,
namely, how he came to get so much into debt in so short a period 1
The bankrupt replied that he had goue on as fair a system as he could.
For instance, he wanted goods, and asked for them, and got them. The
tradesmen then wanted the money, and asked for it, and did not get it;
that > all the difference. (Laughter, in which the Commissioner
joinea.
Sir C. F. Williams admitted that there was a good deal of truth in
that, but he saw that the bankrupt had been to Margate with a very large
sum of money. What had become of that
The Bankrupt. That's exactly what I want to know (a laugh). All
I know, is, that I went, and the money went. I came back again, and I
should be very glad to see the money come back again also. (Laughter).
Sir C. F. Williams. That seems to me a very fair and straightforward
wish on the part of the bankrupt. He would like to see the money back
again—probably to divide it amongst his creditors. I really don't see
what more he could do, if he had the money now in his pocket. My only
wish is to see justice done.
A Creditor. Yes, that's all very fine: but we are done as well as
justice. (Cries of Hear.)
Sir C. F. Williams. Silence I sit here as a judge, and if those inter-
ruptions are to take place, I will have the Court cleared. (To the Bank-
rupt.) Here are some items I cannot understand. What became of all
the money you earned in the last year.
The Bankrupt. That's what puzzles me. Some of it went this way,
and some that way, and some the other.
A Creditor. None of it seems to have come this way. (A laugh.)
Sir C. F. Williams. That laughter is very indecent, and I will certainly
protect the feelings of the Bankrupt as well as my own dignity. (To the
Bankrupt ;) I see an item for keeping a carriage. Pray can you favour
us with an explanation of that
The Bankrupt. In the first place a carriage is cheaper. It takes you
where you like, when you like, and how you like. It puts you down,
takes you up, drives you on, carries you off, whisks you round, and brings
you home in no time.
Sir C. F. Williams. That's very true.
cab or an omnibus |
The Bankrupt. Why, clearly, it must be cheaper. If you get into a
cab or an omnibus, you must dip into your ready money. You exhaust
your . you cripple your means, and empty your pockets; so that
pockets of your creditors naturally suffer in the end. But if you
But how is it cheaper than a

have a private carriage, your account, as well as your carriage, will keep
running on. (A laugh.)
Sir C. F. Williams (smiling.) That is true to a certain extent. But
what do you propose to do now
The B.º. My income has hitherto been so much—say so much
in round numbers. Suppose it to be as much again as half. I have no
objection to pay over to my creditors that portion of it which I can do
without—say the half, and I will keep the as much again, that is to say,
it shall be proportioned into two. I will take the as much again as half,
and the remainder my creditors are welcome to.
Sir C. F. Williams. This seems very fair.
don't think you can do more.
The Bankrupt. We have been doing all we could for some time, I can
assure you. We only want to be set upon our legs again. It is really
bad enough to owe the money, and not to have it; but to be lectured
about it into the bargain, is rather too hard.
Sir C. F. Williams. But why did you go away from your creditors?
The Bankrupt. What was the use of staying with them We are
blamed for going to our creditors at all ; and now we are blamed for not
going to them, when we really could do them no good—for we of course
could not pay them. So we went to Margate, intending to settle with
everybody.
Sir C. F. Williams. A very good intention. But pray how was it to be
carried out !
The Bankrupt. We had not time to think of that. I told one of my
principal creditors, some months ago, that I would if I could, but I
couldn't. If I could, it is possible now that I should; and hereafter I
will if I can—but that depends on circumstances. I mean, of course, my
own circumstances.
Sir C. F. Williams hoped it would be so. He (Sir C. F. Williams)
would be glad to see the bankrupt begin the world again.
A Creditor. Hadn't he better begin at the other end—for if he begins
in the old way, there will be little good result from it. (A laugh.)
Sir C. F. Williams thought this a very unfair observation; and, after
a few encouraging remarks to the Bankrupt, the inquiry terminated.
(To the Bankrupt :) I
Qſbt ſºlitrosſopital $otíttp.
The attendance of members was unusually large at the last meeting
of this Society. Mr. C. Pearce was called to the chair.
The first object brought under the focus of the microscope was the
dividend of a Waterloo-bridge share. After many experiments, in
which the strongest light, including the hydro-oxygen, had been thrown
upon it, the dividend was declared to approach nearest in shape to that
º round figure, with nothing at all in it, which, upon an increased
force of the glass was found to be a perfect 0. The shareholder whose
eyes had been opened during the investigation, seemed to be forcibly
struck with the accuracy of the result. The dividend was ordered to
be deposited in the Museum of the Microscopical Society.
The next object submitted to the microscope, was one day's ration of food
as allowed by the Commissioners in a Poor-law Union. The microscope was
magnified to its utmost power to allow this operation a fair chance of suc-
cess; but, after every experiment had failed, the President said, “that
in all his experience of atoms, he had never seen anything so surprisingly
wanting in size or substance, though a microscope which magnified objects
no less than 60,000,000 times had been used to help the discovery.” This
announcement did not seem to surprise anybody.
After several sanguine members had endeavoured to magnify the sur-
plus of the revenue, the interest of a Pennsylvanian bond, and “the
sense” of the House of Commons, the microscope was locked up for the
night, and the President and members adjourned to the tea-room, to
refresh themselves after the labours of the evening.
ORIGIN OF “CUTTING YOUR STICK.”
MR. Punch,--I deeply regret that the subjoined (my last dis-
covery) was made too late for insertion in my edition of SHAxsrean E.
I therefore send it to you. The passage will, I trust, for ever set
at rest the question so long and so eloquently debated between
Mr. CHARLEs KNIGHT and myself. And now, sir, for the origin of
“cutting your stick.”
Pilgrims, on setting out on their journey to the Holy Land, went
with scrip and staff, but when their vows were accomplished, they
cut off branches of palm-trees, which are a common produce of those
countries, to use as staff or stick, and brought them back as a proof
of having fulfilled their vows. Hence, when some pious brother
Francis would inquire after some holy brother Paul, who had already
departed on his way homeward, the short but ample answer would be,
“He has cut his stick.”
Your obedient servant,

ADAPTED TO THE MEAN Est capacity-
Miss Rainforth, one day
Having gone out to play,
(Then a very young lady) was hurried,
By a shocking fierce man,
From a vagabond clan,
Away to the green-room, quite flurried 1
This abduction, so free,
Was lamented in D,
With a pathos quite like Catalani,
By her father, Arnheim,
Who sung out in slow time ;
(Count Arnheim was play'd by Borrani).
But, lo l after act one,
Without help of the “sun,”
Or (as Wordsworth has said) of the “shower.”
This damsel so nice,
With a very sweet voice,
Grew twelve inches in less than an hour !
And, having now seen,
Summers full seventeen,
Her heart could not wholly withstand
The very soft “sawder.”
Of a dashing marauder,
Named Harrison—one of the band.
So the maid, in reply,
After heaving a sigh,
Sang a song—now the darling of Fame,
Which, if not quite grammatical,
Was very poetical,
That Harrison “lov'd her the same.”
As we’ve all heard a few
Of the stories so new
About gipsies and children, I ween,
I need scarcely relate,
How a fortunate fate
Gave Borrani again his Arline.
Suffice it to say,
In a summary way,
That a chain, round her neck which she wore,
By a stern new policeman,
Accustomed to seize men,
Was carried a justice before:
That she knew not the theft;
That the chain was a gift
From her supposititious mamma;
And this damsel so nice,
(With a very sweet voice)
In the magistrate found her papal
We have, then, a third act;
A most curious fact;
Which none understood, till they knew
The author had thought,
That in justice he ought
A moral to add to the two.
So a lesson he gave
(This poet so grave,)
To singers and men; and the fall
Of Miss Betts, at the end,
By the hand of a friend,
Was felt as the MoRAL by all.
MR. COOPER.
Of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, prepares pupils for the Pulpit, the
Bar, and the Stage. The following specimen of eloquence, is selected
from the reports of what occurred on Thursday Evening, at Drury Lane
Theatre.
“Mr. Cooper then came forward and addressed the audience as fol-
lows:– Ladies and Gentlemen ; M. Duprez, impressed with a sense
of his own exertions—that is to say, the fatigue of the present, and
knowing that the future—under these circumstances, he’”
It will be seen that one great advantage of this style of speech-making
is, that it dispenses with the disagreeable necessity of a finish, for it is
concluded, as a matter of course, by a burst of laughter from the audience.
Gentlemen taught to make speeches according to the above specimen
at the shortest notice, and on the most reasonable terms. Classes held
for off-hand eloquence ; and laughers in attendance to rehearse the
interruptions which supply the chasms in the speeches.
PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY.
SoME people, when they want to go to Brixton,
Or Bow, or Kensington, or Camden Town,
If “Bussing of it” is the mode they've fixed on,
Enter a pastry-cook's, and there sit down,
And keep on eating buns until they’re sick,
Before a vehicle comes by that goes in
The right direction;–but I know a trick
Worth two of that at least, if not a dozen.
Instead of waiting in the way I mention,
Walk slowly on towards the wished for scene,
Telling yourself that 'tis with the intention
Of being caught up by the right machine.
You NEveR will be, though you walk to Chester 1
And so you'll save—if you this simple race try-
Your time, your patience, and your silver tester;
Besides an indigestion from the pastry.
More Royal Bounty.
In consequence of the benevolent arrangements now carried into
execution at the Palace, including the giving away of the cut-bread to
the poor, and the alleged distribution of the unconsumed wine, among
the weak and feeble, it is in contemplation by the proprietors of the
Morning Post to present an humble petition, soliciting all the “unap-
propriated spirit,” in the hope of strengthening the leading articles.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CUT FOR THE CURIOUS.
DEAR MR. Punch,
Not belonging to the Antiquarian Society, and not having the
pleasure of Mr. Widdicombe's acquaintance, I submit to your profound
judgment the enclosed sketch of a specimen of ancient needlework, which
it was my good fortune to rescue from the recesses of the rag-bag of a
marine-store shop. That it is of high antiquity does not, in my opinion,
admit of the shadow of a doubt; but, perhaps, sir, you will inform me of its
most probable date, as it is my intention to present it to the British
Museum. To assist you, I will give an outline of its history since last
Friday, when I purchased it. I called that day upon Mr. Rummidge, who
keeps a marine-store. One of his men, who goes round the metropolitan
suburbs with paper windmills and farthing kites, to collect from the
juvenile portion of the suburban community broken leaden tea-spoons,
old iron, rags, bones, cast-off horse-shoes, and other articles, bought of a
cook some rags and kitchen-stuff, among which was found the treasure I
send you. This is all I know of it. I asked the opinion of Mr. Rummidge
concerning it, and he informed me that he opined it to be the handiwork
of somebody's grandmother when a child. With all deference to his judg-
ment, however, I think he is utterly ignorant of its real value. Is it
not more probably a portion of some ancient herald's tabard To you,
however, I leave a problem so difficult of solution. I wish I could
convey to you some idea of the vivid vermilion of the lions, the red
beaks and eyes, the light blue heads, and yellow bodies of the birds.
Of the figures of the inanimate objects I can offer no opinion, except that
the two inferior lateral ones may represent an ancient fire-escape. I will
conclude by drawing your attention to the exact order displayed in the
arrangement of the figures. , You might cut the piece in half, and send
one part by post to-day and the other to-morrow, as you would a bank-
note. Can it be a specimen of antique currency resembling our paper
money But this is merely a speculation en passant.
I am, dear Mr. P., &c.

that had gone abroad; that is to say, if a thing could be said to have
gone abroad which was very prevalent at home (hear). There seemed
to be a notion that the Income-Tax is sevenpence in the pound, now
he begged distinctly to state that so far from the Income-Tax being
sevenpence in the pound, it is, in fact, sevenpence out of the pound,
as any one who had fairſ, paid the Tax could testify.

The
HISTORY or THE NEXT FRENCH REWULUTION.
[From a forthcoming History of Europe.]
CHAP. W.--THE BATTLE OF TOURS.
WE have now to record the expedition of the Prince of Nemours
against his advancing cousin, Henry V. . His Royal Highness could
not march against the enemy with such a force as he would have
desired to bring against them, for his royal father wisely remembering
the vast amount of property he had stowed away under the Tuileries,
refused to allow a single soldier to quit the forts round the Capital,
which thus was defended by one hundred and forty-four thousand
guns (eighty-four pounders), and four hundred and thirty-two
thousand men :-little enough, when one considers that there were
but three men to a gun. To provision this immense army, and a
population of double the amount within the walls, his Majesty
caused the country to be scoured for fifty miles round, and left
neither ox, nor ass, nor blade of When appealed to by the
inhabitants of the plundered district, the Royal Philip replied, with
tears in his eyes, that his heart bled for them—that they were his
children—that every cow taken from the meanest peasant was like
a limb torn from his own body; but that duty must be done, that
the interests of the country demanded the sacrifice, and that in fact
they might go to the deuce—this the unfortunate creatures certainly
did.
The theatres went on as usual within the walls. The Journal des
Débats stated every day that the Pretenders were taken ; the
Chambers sat—such as remained, and talked immensely about honour,
dignity, and the glorious revolution of July; and the King, as his
power was now pretty nigh absolute over them, thought this a good
opportunity to bring in a bill for doubling his children's allowances
all round.
Meanwhile the Duke of Nemours proceeded on his march; and
as there was nothing left within fifty miles of Paris wherewith to
support his famished troops, it may be imagined that he was forced
to ransack the next fifty miles in order to maintain them. He did
so. But the troops were not such as they should have been, con-
sidering the enemy with whom they had to engage.
The fact is, that most of the Duke's army consisted of the National
Guard; who, in a fit of enthusiasm, and at the cry of “LA PATRIE
EN DANGER" having been induced to volunteer, had been eagerly
accepted by his Majesty, anxious to lessen as much as possible the
number of food-consumers in his beleaguered capital. It is said
even that he selected the most gormandizing battalions of the civic
force to send forth against the enemy: viz., the grocers, the rich
bankers, the lawyers, &c. Their parting with their families was
very affecting. They would have been very willing to recall their
offer of marching, but companies of stern veterans closing round them,
marched them to the city gates, which were closed upon them; and
thus perforce they were compelled to move on. As long as he had a
bottle of brandy and a couple of sausages in his holsters, the general
of the National Guard, Odillon Barrot, talked with tremendous
courage. Such was the power of his eloquence over the troops, that,
could he have come up with the enemy while his victuals lasted,
the issue of the combat might have been very different. But in the
course of the first day's march he finished both the sausages and the
brandy; and became quite uneasy, silent, and crest-fallen.
It was on the fair plains of Touraine, by the banks of silver Loire,
that the armies sate down before each other, and the battle was to
take place which had such an effect upon the fortunes of France.
'Twas a brisk day of March : the practised valour of Nemours
showed him at once what use to make of the army under his orders,
and having enfiladed his National Guard battalions, and placed his
artillery in echelons, he formed his cavalry into hollow squares on
the right and left of his line, flinging out a cloud of howitzers to fall
back upon the main column. His veteran infantry he formed behind
his National Guard—politely hinting to Odillon Barrot, who wished
to retire under pretence of being exceedingly unwell, that the
regular troops would bayonet the National Guard if they gave way an
inch—on which their general turning very pale, demurely went back
to his post. His men were dreadfully discouraged; they had slept
on the ground all night; they regretted their homes and their
comfortable night-caps in the Rue St. Honoré ; they had luckily
fallen in with a flock of sheep and a drove of oxen at Tours, the day
before ; but what were these, compared to the delicacies of Chevet’s
or three courses at Véfour's 1 They mournfully cooked their steaks
and cutlets on their ramrods, and passed a most wretched night.
The army of Henry was encamped opposite to them, for the most
part in better order. The noble cavalry regiments found a village,
in which they made themselves pretty comfortable, Jenkins's Foot
taking possession of the kitchens and garrets of the buildings. The
Irish brigade, accustomed to lie abroad, were quartered in some
potato fields, where they sang Moore's melodies all night. There
were, besides the troops regular and irregular, about three thousand
priests and abbés with the army; armed with scourging whips, and
chanting the most lugubrious canticles: these reverend men were
found to be a hindrance than otherwise to the operations of the
regular forces.
It was a touching sight, in the morn-
ing before the battle, to see the alacrity
with which JENKINs's regiment sprung
up at the first receillée of the bell, and
engaged (the honest fellows ) in offices
almost menial for the benefit of their
French allies. The duke himself set
the example, and blacked to a nicety
the boots of HENRI. At half-past ten,
after coffee, the brilliant warriors of
the cavalry were ready ; their clarions
rung to horse, their banners were given
to the wind, their shirt-collars were
exquisitely starched, and the whole air
was scented with the odours of their
pomatums and pocket-handkerchiefs.
JENKINs had the honour of holding
the stirrup for HENRI. “My faithful
duke 1” said the prince, pulling him by
the shoulder-knot, “thou art always at
thy Post.” “Here, as in Wellington-
street, sire,” said the hero, blushing—
and the prince made an appropriate
speech to his chivalry, in which allusions to the lilies, Saint Louis,
Bayard, and Henri Quatre, were, as may be imagined, not spared.
“Ho! standard-bearer " the prince concluded, “Fling out my ori-
flamme. Noble gents of France, your King is among you to-day !”
Then turning to the Prince of Ballybunion, who had been drink-
ing whisky-punch all night with the Princes of Sligo and Connemara,
“Prince,” he said, “the Irish brigade has won every battle in the
French history—we will not deprive you of the honour of winning
this. You will please to commence the attack with your brigade.”
Bending his head until the green plumes of his beaver mingled with
the mane of the Shetland pony which he rode, the Prince of Ireland
trotted off with his aides-de-camp, who rode the same horse, a power-
ful grey, with which a dealer at Nantes had supplied them on their
and the prince's joint bill at three months.
The gallant sons of Erin had wisely slept until the last minute in
their potato-trenches, but rose at once at the summons of their
beloved prince. Their toilet was the work of a moment—a single
shake and it was done. Rapidly forming into a line, they advanced
headed by their generals, who, turning their steeds into a grass-field,
wisely determined to fight on foot. Behind them came the line of
British foot under the illustrious Jenkins, who marched in advance
perfectly collected, and smoking a Manilla cigar. The cavalry were
on the right and left of the infantry, prepared to act in pontoon, in
echelon, or in ricochet, as occasion might demand. The prince rode
behind, supported by his staff, who were almost all of them bishops,
archdeacons, or abbés, and the body of ecclesiastics followed, singing
to the sound, or rather howl, of serpents and trombones, the Latin
canticles of the revered Franciscus O'Mahony, lately canonised under
the name of Saint Francis of Cork.
The advanced lines of the two contending armies were now in
presence — the national guard of Orleans, and the Irish brigade.
The white belts and fat paunches of the guard presented a terrific
appearance, but it might have been remarked by the close observer,
that their faces were as white as their belts, and the long line of their
bayonets might be seen to quiver. General Odillon Barrot, with a
cockade as large as a pancake, endeavoured to make a speech—the
words, honneur, patrie, Français, champ-de-bataille, might be distinguished,
but the general was dreadfully flustered, and was evidently more at
home in the Chamber of Deputies than in the field of war.
The Prince of Ballybunion, for a wonder, did not make a speech.
“Boys,” said he, “we’ve enough talking at the Corn-exchange ;
bating’s the word now.” The Green-Islanders replied with a tre-
mendous hurroo which sent terror into the fat bosoms of the French.
“Gentlemen of the National Guard,” said the prince, taking off his
hat and bowing to Odillon Barrot, “will ye be soigsthramely obleeg-

ing as to fire first.” This he said because it had been said at Fontenoy, but
chiefly because his own men were only armed with shillelaghs, and therefore
could not fire.
But this proposal was very unpalatable to the National Guardsmen; for
though they understood the musket-exercise pretty well, firing was the thing
of all others they detested, the noise and the kick of the gun and the smell
of the powder being very unpleasant to them. “We won't fire,” said Odillon
ABarrot, turning round to Colonel Saugrenue and his regiment of the line-
which, it may be remembered, was formed behind the National Guard.
“Then give them bayonet,” said the colonel, with a terrific oath; “Charge,
Corbleu !”
At this moment, and with the most dreadful howl that ever was heard, the

National Guard was seen to rush forwards wildly, and with immense velocity
towards the foe. The fact is, that the line-regiment behind them, each select-
ing his man, gave a poke with his bayonet between the coat tails of the
Nationals, and those troops bounded forwards with an irresistible swiftness.
Nothing could withstand the tremendous impetus of that manoeuvre. The
Irish brigade was scattered before it, as chaff before the wind. The Prince
of Ballybunion had barely time to run Odillon Barrot through the body,
when he too was borne away in the swift route. They scattered tumultuously,
and fled for twenty miles without stopping. The Princes of Donegal and
Connemara were taken prisoners, but though they offered to give bills at
three months, and for a hundred thousand pounds, for their ransom, the offer
was refused, and they were sent to the rear when the Duke of Nemours,
hearing they were Irish generals, and that they had been robbed of their
ready money by his troops, who had taken them prisoners, caused a comfort-
able breakfast to be supplied to them, and lent them each a sum of money.
How generous are men in success the Prince of Orleans was charmed with
the conduct of his National Guards, and thought his victory secure. He
despatched a courier to Paris with the brief words, “We met the enemy
before Tours. The National Guard has done its duty. The troops of the
Pretender are routed. Vire le Roi!” The note, you may be sure, appeared in
the Journal des Débats, and the Editor, who only that morning had called
Henri V. “a great Prince, an august exile,” denominated him instantly a
murderer, slave, thief, cut-throat, pickpocket, and burglar.
A CHURCH CRYSTAL.
WHEN dirt is dry it rubs off. This appears to be as true of the dirt that in
this miry world falls upon a man's character, as of the muck that defiles his
boots. His cordovan to-night may reek with city mire; the foulness dries,
hardens, and yielding to the friction of hogs' bristles, gives place to a lustrous
polish. What was filth, polluting any decent hearth-rug, is now a brilliant
Day and Martin, fit, ay, to tread a Bishop's carpet. And so it is with the
immortal part of man, especially when the said immortal part dignifies a canon
and a rector. The Rev. H. C. MARsh illustrates this beautiful truth. In a
recent trial, he has shewn that however dirty his boots may have been, treading
the foul ways of London—its filthy nooks and corners of filthiest vice—he had,
at least, a soul to bear his leather jocund company. The Bishop of PETER-
sonough cannot, however, remove Mr. Marsh from the insulted church, for
--
this wise and sufficient reason—the offences committed
are dated two years back 1
“This crime had been committed two years ago, therefore his (the
Bishop's) hands were tied. What he knew was this:-of course, criminal
conduct had taken place; but it was said to have been at Paris, and there
is another clause in that Church Discipline Bill which gives power to the
Bishop to take notice of crimes committed only in his own diocese.”
A sin—let it be of the foulest kind—if committed by a
clergyman two years ago, is supposed to become dry, and
so gets rubbed off. Mr. MARsh’s character, for all pas-
toral purposes, has been cleaned with his boots. Two
years ago, it was grimed with moral dirt picked up in the
company of a French harpy; but it is now bright again,
and warranted to keep its polish in any climate. It has
been an old English boast, that our soil gives freedom to
every foreign slave; it may, we find, be the pride of
every other country, that she gives freedom, to enact the
profligate in every character, to an English clergyman.
Would a Mr. MARsh go yokefellow with a mercenary
DALILAH, he has only to cross the Channel. He may be
the most abandoned ruffian in Paris, but sweetly magical
is the air of England, for no sooner does he come home,
than, legally purged of his iniquity, he may mount the
pulpit, and, secure in his infamy, make mouths at his
Bishop. Such is the wisdom of the Ecclesiastical Law:
It would be arrogant in us to question the excellence
of such enactment, but we have received a letter which
certainly convinces us that the law is very partial in its
operation, and should be immediately amended. The
epistle is from an unfortunate gentleman, at present a
convict at Woolwich, sentenced by a callous British jury
to transportation for the error of bigamy.
“SIR,-By a lucky chance, I have seen the Times, contain-
ing a report of the Bishop of Peterborough's speech in the
Lords. It appears that a Mr. Marsh has been a very sad dog,
indeed º sense of propriety forbids me to enumerate his
peccadilloes), but that having been wicked so long as two
years ago, his black has been bleached by time into white.
Having given the law the slip for two years, he may now grin
at it." N. sir, let me call your attention to my case.
“Last sessions, I was sentenced to seven years' transpor-
tation. And wherefore ? Simply, for bigamy. In 1830, I
married Mary Stump; in 1835 I left the said Mary, and
wedded (for a consideration) Rebecca Dobbins. This, sir,
was exactly nine years ago, for to-day is my second wedding-
day. Now, sir, I submit if two years will bleach a clergy-
man, nine years ought to have made me as white as ivory.
Surely, sir, I–a mere bigamist—should be allowed to plead
this newly-discovered statute of limitations, as well as the
Rector of Barnack.
“I remain, your obedient Servant,
“DuPLEx Doubleknot.
“P. S. Sam Prig, a fellow-convict, last session sentenced for
a matter of a silver box stolen in 1840, begs me to ask why
parsons should plead their two years, any more than a pick-
pocket. Twenty other convicts want me to put similar ques-
tions, but time flies, and paper's short. Get the Bishop of
Peterborough to do what you can for us.”
We really think that Messrs. Doubleknot and Prig
have made a case out for Parliament. Why, we ask,
should clergymen be allowed to clean their characters
with their boots, and not the poor bigamist, or the forlorr
pick-pocket 7 Q.
A Handsome Thing Handsomely Done.
We are happy to inform our readers that the Duke of
Wellington, Earls Winchelsea and Cardigan, the Attorney-
General for Ireland, and other distinguished heroes of twelve
paces, have in the most handsome and delicate manner, caused
the information to be conveyed to the widow of Colonel Faw-
cett, that they will charge themselves with the payment of the
pension denied to her by Sir Robert Peel. This intimation
was accompanied by the amount of the pension for the first
year, dating from July last—an act of high principle.
Frtiendly advice.

will visit England in May. We advise His Imperial Majesty,
if he wishes to land in safety, above all to avoid Wapping.

WOMAN AND HER
INTERROGATIVES.
“My Love 1 Do You Think Those FELLows ARE Following Us *
Woman is generally a timid and retiring crea-
ture. She comes down to us with some six
thousand years' character to such effect; we be-
lieve the truth of it : fire should not melt the
creed out of us; wild horses could not tear it
from our bosom. And yet Punch has his eyes;
and therefore cannot but perceive that woman
—the gentle, the trembling, the meek and butter-
mouthed—has for some time past been crying
out and swaggering prodigiously in all reviews,
and magazines, and newspapers. Every day and
hour of our reading life does the fair creature,
woman, (blessings on her cherry lips () bounce
out upon us with a startling interrogative. For
the last twelve months has she—the modest and
reserved—stood in the Times newspaper, boldly
asking questions of all sorts of people.
“Can woman regenerate society?”
This is one of the queries which have now
beset us for months past; and as we never could
find it in our heart to contradict the dear crea-
tures, we really know not what to say. We hesi-
tate ere we answer—like the time-hallowed echo
of our beloved friend —“in the affirmative: ”
whilst we are more than perplexed at the mere
thought of “No.” The truth is, we have looked
upon society so long—have seen so much abomi-
nable wickedness in it—that we tremble at the
bare idea of handing over such a world of defiling
iniquity to the consideration of that household
goddess—woman. We should as soon think of
clapping a besom into the hands of Hebe, and
insist upon her doing task-work of scavangery.
Nevertheless, as Woman will continue to put
forth her interrogatories, and that in a manner
sufficiently indicative of her own confidence in
her powers, we know not whether Mrs. Eve
ought not to have a trial. Yes; we consent,
If she can, Woman shall regenerate society; and,
therefore, let her begin her task immediately.
Will it be deemed impertinent of Punch if he
jot down for Woman a few matters in the way of
beginnings
et Woman make an early call at the House
of Peers. Lord BRough AM alone will test her
powers of regeneration. If she can at all bring
him back to anything like the late HENRY
BRough AM, Esq., we shall have some hope of her
self-imposed mission.
In the next place, Woman should certainly
give an early tea-party to all the Bishops, and,
as a proof of his humility, insist that the Bishop
of Exeter should hand round the muffins.
Woman may next look into the House of Com-
mons. We know Sir Robert PEEL has no need
of her care ; the Prime Minister having (teste
Lord HARDwicke) all the domestic virtues that
were ever worked into a sampler: nevertheless,
if Molly, the maid of all-work, ever had a dirty
house to make sweet and clean, Woman will
find enough to do in the Commons.
Woman may next step over to the Courts of
Law ; and if it be proved that she can morally
regenerate anything therein, why Punch will
grant her all she asks; and to shew his sincerity
will buy all MRs. Ellis's Women, from the Wives
of England to England's Stepmothers. More:
as a further penance for his scoffing, he will
bind himself to read them.
However, until Woman begins in good earnest
the laborious work, we may every day expect
her to put a few more questions in the way of
title-pages to regenerating volumes. Punch has
been favoured with a few, which, without any
advertising fee, he most magnanimously subjoins.
Can Woman make Bass's Pale Ale 2
Can Woman live, and wear no Ribands 2
Can Woman do without sal volatile?
Can Woman stuff Ducks 3
Can Woman take her bonnet off at a theatre 2
Can Woman sit up for her husband till 4 a.m.,
and smile when she lets “the brute’’ in 3
Can Woman cheat at housekeeping 3
Can Woman give away her heart, and ask for
no return ?
CAN Woman KEEP (AND NEveR Use it) The key
oF THE win E-CELLAR }
We shall duly notice these books in their order
of publication. The last subject strikes us as
being very difficult to handle with a satisfactory
result.

THE NEW NOVELS.
We understand that in consequence of the
success of “Whitefriars,” Lord William Lennox
is preparing for the press a novel under the title
of “Blackfriars.” It is also the intention of this
celebrated “wit among Lords,” to bring out a
series of tales on the plan of Mr. W. H. Ains.
worth; but, in order to obviate the charge of
having followed that illustrious author, (illus.
trious by portraiture, as Lord Brougham would
say,) Lord William Lennox purposes meeting
the author of “Jack Sheppard,” instead of going
| after him. It is well known that Mr. Ainsworth,
having started from the Tower of London, has
come along by Old St. Paul's, till he has worked
himself up as far westward as St. James's, or the
Court of Anne, though what can be got out of
| Anne's Court, St. James's, except pattens, second-
hand furniture, and meat pies, we are wholly at a
loss to discover. Lord William Lennox intends
starting from Westminster Abbey in three vols.;
he will then come round by the Horse Guards,
(a Tale of the Wars,) where he will turn off to
avoid clashing at Whitehall with Mr. Ainsworth.
We intend starting off ourselves from Baker
Street, (a tale of the Tussauds,) and shall work
our way gradually down towards the Strand,
which will be the scene of a projected work to be
called “St. Martin's, a Legend of the Fields.”
BIOGRAPHICAL AND LITERARY RIDIDLES.
SIR,
Sometimes after business-hours in our
establishment we while away the evening with
social converse and harmless laughter. Some
of our young gents. are then fond of proposing
riddles, and considerable applause has been
excited by the following, which, perhaps, may
be suited to the columns of your entertaining
miscellany.

ner (whose memoirs I have perused with un-
feigned delight) be compared to a certain
kind of potato

MR. Moon has been presenting to her Majesty
a finished proof of Mr. Doo's portrait of Prince
Albert. The union between Moon and Doo seems
so perfectly natural, that we are only surprised it
has not taken place long ago. It is, however,

sion on which a Doo has been introduced at Court
through Mr. Moon's agency.

an of the §ºsts.
If a statue be ever erected to the living honour or to the memory
of Sir Robert PEEL, the artist will wholly fail in his illustration of
the true greatness of the statesman, unless he deck the bronze with
widow's cap and weepers. In the long and sinuous career of the
noble baronet, we know of nothing equal to his denial of a pension to
Mrs. Colonel Fawcett, and, almost in the same week, his speech in
favour of the “laws of honour” as they exist. In one hand, does the
Prime Minister hold the scales of justice, and in the other a duelling-
pistol I
Much dull nonsense has been talked and written on duelling
within the past few days. Sir H. HARDINGE assures us that the
officers of the army are bound over by the expressed advice of Her
Majesty to keep the peace one with the other; but that they are
allowed the right of shooting at all civilians. “Ought a man to be
insulted with impunity because he was an officer 1" asked Sir Henry.
Why, if it were the law that an officer forfeited his commission by
going out in a duel with a civilian, it would be as cowardly to insult
him, as it is at present to pass an affront upon a clergyman.
The law of Switzerland has been quoted as one efficient remedy
for the abuse. There, let a man kill another, and the slayer is
answerable for the dead man's debts. This would never do in Eng-
land. Make such the law, and we should have high-souled debtors of
the aristocracy insulting “dead shots” to be relieved at once of their
lives and their pecuniary responsibilities. Dulce est pro patriá mori, is
now a motto in good fashion. Alter the law to that of Switzerland,
and the motto would run—“Sweet it is to die for one's tailor 1"
The word “tailor” naturally enough brings to our mind The Morn-
ing Post. JENKINs has written a defence of duelling, smelling, like
Acres' letter, of gunpowder. He asks, with a fine cogency of
reasoning—
“What may be the amount of misery to which duelling has given rise, compared with
the amount of misery which the perversion of law by dishonest attorneys—and fraudu-
lent operations on the Stock Exchange-and the vicious action of our monetary and
manufacturing systems have created 7”
But why, JENKINs, cannot duelling be made to reach these people?
Why should not a sharp attorney, who serves a writ before he writes
a premonitory letter, be “waited upon by a friend,” and if possible
be duly pistolled in the Temple Gardens ! Why should there not
be a Shooting Gallery added to the Stock Exchange, for the better
education of jobbers, that, when tricked by superior sagacity, they
may call out the lucky buyers or sellers We do not see why
all tradesmen should not sell under fear of the pistol. For instance,
if your milkman is proved to insult his milk with water, don't send
him his bill, but a challenge.
The Chinese are a wise people, and know the true use, the real
dignity, of the duel We could not do better than improve our
laws of honour by their code; sure we are, it would do more than
any other measure to make men treat one another with gingerly
politeness. With the Chinese, each party, to show the purity of
his intentions and the greatness of his heart, at a given signal rips
up his bowels. We put it to the reader—would Lord CARD1GAN
have gone out with Captain Tuckett under such conditions !
Would his Lordship have shown his heart at any price
THE BOW-STREET BANQUETS.
We are happy to be enabled to state, that the public dinner given to
Mr. O'Connell at Covent Garden Theatre, in his character of “A Con-
victed Conspirator,” will be shortly followed by a series of entertainments
to the individuals against whom a verdict of guilty may have been re-
turned at the last Sessions of the Central Criminal Court. The éclat
attending a conviction by a legal tribunal must, of course, get rid of much
of the odium in which those persons who have been so unfortunate as to
violate the law have hitherto been held. The recent banquet, most
appropriately given opposite the police-office in Bow Street, must be con-
sidered as the first of a series. It is much to be regretted that the cele-
brated Ikey Solomons is not in England to mark the change that has taken
place in public feeling within the last few years. This venerable man,
who was driven with ignominy from his native shores, might now be the
honoured guest of hundreds congregated—at a guinea a head—to show
their respect and sympathy for the victim of legal severity. We under-
stand that the forthcoming banquets will be graced by some of the most
celebrated of our convicted criminals, who have promised to attend as
soon as the engagements they are now under will leave them at liberty to
do so.

PUNCH*S MIRROR OF PARLIAMENT.
Lond FRANcis EGEaton observed, that while he was anxious to
give a fair hearing to both sides, he had rather not listen to either,
lest, in being guided by one, he should be obliged to deviate from the
other. (Cheers.) Without being a party man, he (Lord Francis
Egerton) was prepared to go to the full extent with the Whigs, so
long as it did not prevent him from acting, as he was very anxious to
do, with the Tories. (Hear.) He might, perhaps, be called vacilla-
ting, but surely if he went a little too much to the right, he was
acting with fairness when he returned towards the left; and while
he remained true to the doctrine of finality, he could not be
blamed by the movement party, if he accompanied them in their
progress. (Cheers.) He was a friend to protection, but he was not
unfriendly to the abolition of protection; and indeed he felt willing
to concur in every view of every question that any member of that
house, on either side, might be disposed to promulgate. Having
expressed himself thus distinctly, he should give his vote in accord-
ance with his convictions; and as he had stated these rather fully,
it would be unnecessary for him to declare his opinions further, and
he would therefore vote with those whose views he so fully coin-
cided in.
THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA IN ENGLAND.
THE Morning Post is wallowing in delight at the prospect of a visit to
London by the Emperor Nicholas. It will be a sublime event, “this
visit of the greatest of absolute sovereigns to the greatest of constitutioual
kingdoms.” According to the Post, Nicholas and VicroRIA will be upon
their very best behaviour;
“And so between His Darkness and Her Brightness,
There’ll pass a mutual glance of great politeness?”
We understand that Mr. Moses, in memory of the treatment of the
Russian Jews, will take proper measure of Nicholas, and that a bear (late
the property of Mr. Cross) is already under the tuition of certain Polish
refugees in Camden Town, in order to welcome the autocrat with a most
affectionate hug.
Great Powers of Execution.
A new paper-cutting machine has been invented, which, the papers say,
“is constructed on the principle of the guillotine.” We recominend it to
the-notice of reviewers who are fond of cutting-up new books.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
cHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH...-OF CORPORATIONS.
N addition to natural persons, the law, in
honourable emulation of Madame Tussaud,
of wax-work notoriety, has constituted certain
artificial persons. These are called bodies
politic, bodies corporate, or corporations, and
they stick together like wax, in which respect
they bear a still closer resemblance to the
artificial persons in Madame Tussaud's col-
lection.
Corporations are either aggregate or sole.
When aggregate they consist of many, such as
the mayor and common councilmen of a city—and precious common
councilmen some of them are; the head and fellows of a college—nice
fellows some of them are also ; and the dean and chapter of a cathedral
church, which endures, of course, until the end of the chapter. Cor-
porations sole consist of one person and his successors, such as a king
or a bishop, or a parson. This is the origin of the doctrine that the king
never dies ; for it is always as the boys say, “One down and another
come on.” So that in fact the throne, like the curds and whey house
at Hyde Park Corner, is never vacant. “The parson,” says Coke,
“quatenus parson shall never die,” and the same may be said of the
street-keeper, who, quatenus street-keeper, enjoys official immortality.
The glorious old constitutional watchword of “Never say die” j;
has its origin in the circumstance hinted at.
Another division of corporations is into ecclesiastical and lay; the
former being spiritual, such as bishops and parsons, in the present day,
and formerly monks, abbots, or priors; but it is
doubtful whether the priors were prior to the monks.
Lay corporations are such as the society of antiquaries,
for the study of antiquities; and of course the mem-
bers are expected to be well up in all the old jokes,
which are better known as the “ryghte merrie
mysteries of Miller.” There are also eleemosynary
corporations, such as hospitals, where legs are ampu-
tated gratis, from those poor persons who would other-
wise be thrown upon their own hands for surgical
attendance.
Having described the various kinds of corporations,
we shall now ask: — first, how they are made ;
secondly, what they can do ; thirdly, how they are
visited ; and fourthly, how they may be dissolved or
got rid of.
A corporation is made by the sovereign, who uses
the words “Creamus, eriginus, fundamus, incorpo-
ramus,” and the sovereign is guilty of the grossest
tautology in doing so. . A corporation must have a
name, and Romeo therefore when he asks “What's in
a name 1” betrays a frightful ignorance of the beauti-
ful passage in Gilb. Hist. C. P. 182, where it is prettily
laid down that the name is the knot by which a cor-
poration is combined, and without the knot it is not a
corporation at all,—“a point,” says Coke, “that is by
the mass a knotty one.”
We come, secondly, to the rights and powers of a
corporation : the first of which is the right of perpetual
succession; for as every man has a right to live till he
dies, so any corporation has a right to exist till its
existence ceases. This indeed is said to be the very
end for which corporations were established; that is
to say, their very endlessness is the end they are de-
signed to answer. Thirdly, they may sue, or be sued ;
2
quod, or be quodded; grant or receive, give or take,
borrow or lend ; and, in fact, do as they please with
their own just like other people. A corporation may
have a common seal, by which it is bound ; for though
the members may pass their words, it is no conse-
quence what they say till the corporation sealing-wax
renders it incumbent on them to stick to it. A cor-
poration may make by-laws, but these by-laws, by the
by, may have the go-by given to them if they are
contrary to the law of the land,-a rule which is as old
as the twelve tables of Rome; but we forget the date
of those dozen specimens of classic mahogany.
We have, however, done wisely in taking a leaf out of the tables alluded
to. A corporation has some disabilities, and is incapable for instance of
being committed to prison, for there can be no catchee where there is
actually no havee. A corporation is prevented from purchasing lands
without a licence from the sovereign, by certain acts called the statutes of
Mortmain, which means a dead hand, probably from the fact that these
corporations were dead hands at making a bargain.
Öur next inquiry is “how may these corporations be visited " a ques-
tion that would seem to need a reference to the book of etiquette, for when
we talk of a corporation being visited, we allude, of course, to its liability to
be called upon. The sovereign is the visitor of the archbishop; and we
presume that the bell at Lambeth palace, with the brass plate beneath it,
inscribed with the word “Visitors,” is for the exclusive use of royalty.
Lay corporations are said to have no visitors, and the present lord mayor
of London (Magnay) appears to value this exemption, for he never asks
any one to dine with him.
An eleemosynary corporation may be visited by the founder and his
heirs, so that any genuine guy may leave his card as a visitor at Guy's
Hospital.
We will consider, lastly, how corporations may be dissolved, for even
the goodly pearl is capable of dissolution in the gem-destroying vinegar.
A corporation may be dissolved by civil death—but nouncivil death—such
as murder, can put an end to it. It may be extinguished by act of parlia-
ment, or, in other words, by the law, which is as it were dissolving a cor-
poration in hot water; by surrender, which is a sort of suicidal exit, when
the corporation asks itself the question, “to be or not to be f* and prefers
the latter; or, thirdly, by forfeiture of its charter through negligence or
abuse, which formed a pretext in the reigns of Charles and James the
Second for seizing the charter of the city of London. This led to an act
being passed after the Revolution, enacting that the franchises of London
shall never more be forfeited for any cause whatsoever, and thus the lord
mayor and corporation have a carte blanche for any amount of foolery, a
privilege that they one and all, in turn, take unlimited advantage of.
In the foregoing chapters we have given an account of the rights of
persons, which are equally the privilege of the peer and the pot-boy, the
gallant soldier, the sailor, the tinker, the tailor, the ploughboy, the apothe-
cary, and the thief. May the pride of the first never disdain the humble
merit of the second l and may the valour of the third and fourth, added to
the industry of the fifth and sixth, ameliorate the condition of the seventh;
while oh! may the healing art of the eighth restore, in a moral sense, the
degraded ninth to that position, which, in accordance with the rights of
persons, any person has a right to occupy 1

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SHEPHERD OF HAWRIDGE.
The Rev. John Day, Rector—and thereforespiritual shepherd—of
the good folks of Hawridge, near Aylesbury, has—we grieve to
record it—been inconvenienced by a trial at the bar of the Assizes.
The shepherd DAY, from his hapless ignorance of law, unfortunately
meddled with the flock of Mr. WEEDoN ; that is, the rector finding
seven of his neighbour's sheep arrogantly trespassing in his close,
“took out his knife”—so ran the evidence—and “stabbed them all
in the right flank to the depth of about six inches, after which he turned
them out of the stable, and drove them in the direction of their own
pasture.” For this legal mistake, the pulpit shepherd of Hawridge
was compelled to stand in the prisoners' dock at Aylesbury; yes, for
such small inattention to the law of the land, he was obliged to leave
the myrrh and frankincense of the altar, and stand for a time
with orthodox nostrils offended by felon rue. Our heart bleeds, ay,
quite as much as any one of Mr. WEEDoN’s sheep, that the Rev.
John DAY, for his Arcadian ignorance of the law, should for a
moment have suffered such indignity.
Law, however, is like a certain Indian leaf, of which we have
somewhere read. Applied on one side, it draws like a blister;
dexterously turn it, and lo! it acts as a sanative salve. (We remem-
ber, the famous Dr. CHEYNEY is our authority for this vegetable of
double properties.) Law clapt the shepherd of Hawridge in the
felons' dock; and there—suffering Arcadian—with a criminal indict-
ment upon him, his feelings, we will vouch for it, were drawn exceed-
ingly. The whole man was, we doubt not, one large clerical
blister; from head to heel, a very bladder of sensibility. Such is his
condition, when Messrs. PRENDERG Ast and SANDERs (counsel for
the prisoner) apply the other side of the leaf-adroitly turn the law
to the advantage of the patient.
They argued, with tongues of silver, (we should rather say of gold,)
that as the spiritual shepherd had “no grudge against Mr. WEEpon,”
he could not wish to destroy his property unlawfully. On the
contrary, the shepherd DAY believed “that he had a right to kill or
wound the animals,” and therefore merely out with his knife, and
slid it six inches into the sheep, according to Act of Parliament. For
the nonce, he thought the law allowed him sweetly to harmonize the
parson with the butcher; to relieve the monotonous watching of a
flock with a little innocent “hamstringing” of woolly trespassers.
Prettily does the blue apron of the shambles blend with clerical
black ; well does the knife of the butcher assort with the crook of
the Christian shepherd I We trust, however, that this versatility of
power may not some day awkwardly assert itself. A parson, with a
ready hand for sheep-stabbing, might, to the triumph of scoffers, be
strangely forgetful of time and place : when, with meek abstracted
soul, he should utter “Let us pray,” he might in his forgetfulness
exclaim, catching the tone of the market, “What will you buy t”
Again, should the Rev. John DAY, in the fulness of his Christianity,
wish to descant on Nathan's ewe-lamb, he might be checked in his
goodly purpose by the errant thought that the said lamb had been,
like Mr. WEEDoN's sheep, a flagrant trespasser.
The Jury—henceforth let an Aylesbury Jury be typified by
twelve sucking doves—admitted the truthfulness of the defence, and
acquitted the prisoner; who, of course, quitted the dock without
one butcher's stain upon his pulpit black.
Lord AB INGER delivered a touching address. He said—“It was
really most lamentable to see such an ignorance of the first rules and
principles of law in a man occupying the station and filling the office
which the prisoner occupied and filled.”—His Lordship finally advised
the shepherd to apply “some portion of his time in acquiring a know-
ledge of the laws of his country and the rights of his neighbour.” What
an affectionate suggestion of goodness to a neglectful divine I Lord
AB INGER is too courteous a man to hint at the Bible ; but emphati-
cally recommends Blackstone. The Acts of the Apostles might, well
studied, do something for a clergyman; but to be a good Christian,
and properly to love his neighbour, he must have a knowledge of the
Acts of Parliament 1
It is clear that the use and abuse of Shepherd DAY's knife turns
solely on a point of law. Had he used his weapon on the safe side'
of the statute, nobody could reasonably have blamed him had he
quartered every sheep alive. Nay, we doubt whether even the
sheep would have murmured. The Strasburg goose, dying with
swelling liver at the fire, knows that he suffers for the glory of Stras-
burg pies, and—says the author of the Almanach des Gourmands—:
* expires without a tear.” In like manner, Mr. WEEpon's sheep,
"bleeding and lame,” from the steel of Shepherd Day, would have
died uncomplainingly, had their deaths rightfully illustrated the law
of trespass. Our imagination gives voice and words to one of Mr.
WEEDon's sheep. Oris loquitur –“I am stabbed six inches in the
flank by the Rev. John Day, rector of Hawridge, but I die a just
death. Why, tempted by new grass, did I trespass in his close
Why did I crop the rector's blades To be sure, being a Christian
clergyman, he might, at the most, have set his dog at me, and har-
ried me back. But the law was on his side, and so he stuck his knife
in mine. I am justly doomed, and die in honour of an Act of Par-
liament. I might have fallen by a blow from that vulgar, greasy
Joe Tripeley; but, happy sheep ! the hand of a man of peace has
cut and maimed me; and like the victims at a Roman sacrifice, I
have a priest for my butcher 1"
We trust that this bold act of the Rev. John DAY will be signifi-
cantly rewarded. We would suggest something by way of crest, or
coat of arms, to eternize the humanity of the deed. The Pope, to
shew his meekness, carries a lamb. Now, in memory of mutton, we
would suggest that the Rev. John Day should henceforth bear the
pope's-eye. Q.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 135
PUNCH'S GUIDE TO GOVERNMENT SITUATIONS.
few years ago a delusive little Trea-
tise was published under the title
of “How to keep House upon a
Hundred a-year,” which certainly
told the public how the house
might be kept, but not the family
that lived in it.
Seeing a book advertised with
the title of “A Guide to Govern-
ment Situations,” we bought the
work, and, arm d with its talis-
manic power, we rushed to the
Treasury, where we requested to
be shown a few Government situations, intending to walk into the most
eligible, with the aid of our Guide Book. We presumed, in our simplicity,
that places under Government might possibly be something like the 5000
straw bonnets thrown into the linen-drapers' windows at this time of the
year, with the generous intimation, that they are to be (almost) given
Away; and, indeed, we began to suppose that Government situations were
plentiful enough, if people only knew where to go for them. We have,
however, been cruelly deceived; for the only situation under Government
into which the “Guide” seemed likely to get us, was that of first gentle-
man in waiting at the station-house.
Considering it possible that others may be subjected to a disappointment
similar to that we ourselves experienced, we beg leave to offer to the
public a Guide of our own, which we think will be more efficacious than
the one we have already alluded to.
Cbe £ome Bepartment.
The Chief-Secretaryship of this department is a very lucrative place.
lt would be difficult to offer any guide to it, for the individuals who have
held it have reached it through so many crooked ways—such an endless
variety of ins and outs, such constant shifting and changing from side to
side—that it would be quite impossible to follow them. The same may be
said of the Secretaryship of State for the Colonies.
3Laín Bepartment.
The Chancellorship is, of course, the highest prize in this branch of the
public service, and any Guide to Government Situations would be incom-
plete, if it did not point out the way to the woolsack. Lord Brougham's
short and easy method is to go and sit upon it whenever he can, so as to
be prepared to push off the legitimate occupant on the first opportunity,
or to take his place, in the event of his leaving it. The Attorney and
Solicitor-Generalships are prizes worth having; and perhaps one of the
safest roads to legal promotion, particularly in Ireland, would be to get a
brief for the Crown, and challenge the opposite counsel. Country Commis-
sionerships of Bankrupts, which are worth about a thousand a-year, seem
to be very easily obtained, if we may }. by the manner in which these
situations have been hitherto filled. It may be sufficient for the purposes
of our Guide to state, that the only qualification that seems to be actually
indispensable is an utter ignorance of the law of Bankruptcy. We have
arrived at this conclusion merely from a close observation of the qualities
for which the new Commissioners of Bankruptcy have hitherto been dis-
tinguished. We should say, from our experience in this matter, that to
know anything whatever about the subject of his duties would be fatal to
the pretensions of a candidate for the highly lucrative offices alluded to.
Custom ºduge Bepartment.
This branch of the public service has, hitherto, been doubly eligible, for
there has been not .. the salary attached to the various places, but the
pickings have been very considerable. The same pickings exist in other
departments, to which we recommend the applicant for a Government
situation to turn his attention, because the Custom-house perquisites have
been in a great degree curtailed by the very awkward exposures that
have recently transpired. This branch of the public service has been
spoilt for the present, as a source of large emolument; but there are
numerous other departments where the spirit of impertinent curiosity has
not yet been able to penetrate.
Cºrrijeguer Bepartment.
In order to obtain the full benefit of the resources opened out by
employment in this department, it was formerly desirable to cultivate an
imitative style of hand-writing, and to form connections on the Stock
Exchange This branch of the public service was worked to the full
extent of its capabilities by Mr. Beaumont Smith, who was, unfortunately,
not permitted to enjoy the fruits of his ingenuity.
In concluding our Guide to Government Situations, we most earnestly
express to the person in want of one, our most sincere, our most ardent
and our most heartfelt wish, that—he may get it.
Q. Why is a Bill Sticker like a Gambler
4. Because he does nothing but placards (play cards).
THE PROHIBITED COMEDY.
Among the company at Astley's was a rider who, whenever he felt his
own share in the performance going flatly, always contrived to tumble off
his horse, which invariably got him a round of applause, and rendered
him an object of interest during the remainder of the evening. Nothing
can be better than a misfortune, as a source of popularity, for the time
being; and it is sometimes worth the while of a beggar to get wilfully
knocked over by a butcher's cart, when public benevolence, if it has been
previously flagging, will at once receive a stimulus. A gentleman has
written a five-act comedy, which the examiner of plays has prohibited,
and of course there is one universal shout of “Shame I shame I Down
with the Chamberlain l Turn out the licenser!” “Throw him over !” in
fact, do anything with any one who has had any hand or any voice in
offering any obstruction to any amusement of his most omnipotent majesty,
—the People.
There is a society called the Syncretics, whose boast it is that they can
write tragedies which no company can act and no audience can sit out,
but they nevertheless call themselves and each other great men, who
write for posterity. Thank goodness they don't write for us, which is all
we care about. The author of the prohibited comedy has become one of
the great unactables, though his unactability does not arise from the abso-
lute unsitoutableness of his production. He has been extinguished by the
caprice of the examiner of plays, who, by the by, might rescue many a
dramatist from disgrace, many a manager from loss, and many an audi-
ence from nausea, if the power of prohibition were in certain cases freely
exercised. We can see nothing in the prohibited comedy of Richelieu in
Love to warrant the treatment it has experienced. There is no passage
half so strong as a few that occur in the following scene from a comedy of
our own, which we intend presenting to the attention of the licenser. We
have adopted the Elizabethan style, though the subject is a modern one.
SCENE-A Room in the Treasury.
Enter SIR. R. PEEL and SIR JAMEs GRAHAM.
Peel. Marry, come up, but we are precious knaves.
Graham. Ayl quotha, by our ladye, but we are.
Peel. Said you our ladyet
Graham. By my troth I did.
Peel. Thy troth indeed the fancy likes me much :
Thy troth why, marry, what dost call thy troth
Thou didst betroth thyself to Goodman Grey,
And then thou didst betroth thee to his foe.
If that's thy troth, troth me no troths, say I.
Graham. Nay, neighbour Peel, thou pitchest it too strong ;
For were I come to such a pitch as this,
That no black pitch were pitchier than I,
Then mightest thou pitch thus fiercely into me. (He weeps.)
Peel. Nay, do not pour the water from thine eye,
Though it be—all thine eye–in double sense ;
But think me not made for thy pupillage,
Ready to scan the pupils of thine eyes.
Alas, alas ! what hypocrites we both are.
Graham. Marry, come up !
Peel. I'fecks, Gramercy, quotha.
[Ereunt laughing in their sleeves, and the curtain falls.
THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSTITUTE.
A soirée was given here on Thursday, and an explanation was attempted
of a design upon the wall by Mr. Motley, which was very satisfactory to
the motley assemblage of visitors. Some one among the guests intimated
privately that it would be as well, if while designs were being explained
they could get some explanation of the designs of Mr. Buckingham. Sub-
sequently, Mr. Buckingham gave a description of some of the great
American Lakes, and illustrated their depth by talking some most
unfathomable nonsense. Somebody then laid upon the table a piece of
striped paper, which was said to be a plan of the Himalayah Mountains.
One of the visitors then produced a piccolo flute, and played upon it for a
few minutes, which had the effect of gradually clearing the room.
The Short Passage to Arnerica.
Since SIR WALENtine Blake has proposed this scheme, it has been taken
up in various quarters, by individuals to whom the shortest possible cut
to America is a matter of the greatest importance. The plan of Sia
WALENTINE BLake of cutting away the land and carrying a railroad over
the sea will be superseded by a newer and a better notion, for it is now in
contemplation to erect a steam-boat, by the aid of a company ready to go
to any lengths, that will extend half way across the Atlantic, and this
method, added to a plan of dividing the Cape in half, instead of the old
practice of doubling it, will, in the opinion of SIR WALENTINE, Biaks,
exactly achieve the contemplated object.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A POINT IN NATURAL HISTORY.
ATURAL. History may be divided into natural and
!) unnatural—Buffon and Pliny to wit; nor is this
- division confined to the animal kingdom—the
*, lives of Peter Simple and Peter the Great may
be considered natural and unnatural histories.
The mass of mankind have, in all ages, pre-
ferred the latter, just as they prefer a funeral
to a marriage, or a murder to a charity sermon.
Hence, in all ages, certain unfortunate animals
have had their characters most grossly mis-
represented ; and divers eccentric creatures
have assumed a place among the recognised
mammalia. Thus the respectable elk was transformed into the unicorn,
and snakes into flying dragons—whilst, in latter times, William Pitt
was transformed into the “Heaven-born minister,” and George the
Fourth into the “most finished gentleman in Europe.” Then again the
mermaids, centaurs, and anthropophagi of ancient times, are nota whitmore
originally fanciful than some pet monsters of our own enlightened days;
Take, for instance, our “Free-born Englishmen,” our “ Learned
Brothers,” “ Gallant Officers,” and “Honourable Members."—not to
mention such small fry as “talented townsmen,” “indefatigable public
officers,” and “much respected mayors;” and we shall have an army of
imaginative creatures, which we may defy the Heathen Mythology and
antique histories to ditto, or, as the Americans say, to stump.
We shall now come to our point.

he is deeply and mysteriously connected with the turf–that he pervades at

the public must have information. To the editors of Sunday newspapers
we appeal—they are deep in his confidence. Let Vates, Harkaway;

SONGS OF THE CIRCUIT.
FRom Circuit to Circuit although we may roam,
Be it ever so briefless, there's none like the Home ;
A fee from the skies p'rhaps may follow us there,
Which, seek through the Courts, is ne'er met with elsewhere.
Home, Home, sweet sweet Home,
There's none of the Circuits can equal the Home.
When out on the Home, lodgings tempt you in vain,
The railroad brings you back to your chambers again:
On the Home the expenses for posting are small;
Give me that—'tis the Circuit, the cheapest of all.
Home, Home, sweet sweet Home,
There's none of the Circuits can equal the Home.
MAYORAL WISDOM.
We congratulate the City on the varied accomplishments of its chief
Magistrate, whose knowledge of everything in general, but anatomy in
particular, must be regarded as truly wonderful. Hervey discovered the
circulation of the blood, but Magnay has done more, for he has found out
that the human hand branches off immediately from the human heart—a
fact in anatomy which we particularly recommend to the attention of the
College of Surgeons. The following enthusiastic burst from the mouth
of Magnay, puts the question of the construction of the human frame in
an entirely new light, and shows that in the case of Royalty, at least, the
hand and heart are united in Nature's heraldry; so that Shakspeare,
when he talks of the modern heraldry being “hands, not hearts,” was
terribly mistaken. “No sooner,” said Magnay, “ was the Queen Dowager
made acquainted with the melancholy detail, than her Majesty's hand
was stretched out from her bountiful heart in the spirit of charity and
compassion.” The above words ought to be written in letters of portable
gas on the highest tablet in the Temple of Minerva.

“THE FINES WERE INSTANTLY PAID.”
Thr decisions of police magistrates—who, by the way, only dis-
pense the law as they find it—continually exalt poor men with the
knowledge of the high privileges of money, in England. They con-
tinually preach to people of limited means the necessity of putting
themselves in ready cash as the only way of tasting the highest
enjoyment of British citizens. Here is a recent example of this
pleasant truth.
FREDER Ick Johnson, “a young man very fashionably dressed”—
(people who break heads, knock out teeth, and inflict serious wounds
on simple street passengers, are generally as fashionably dressed for
a row as for a party)—was placed at Marlborough-street office for a
series of assaults.
FREDER1ck Johnson (“law student”) assaulted a tradesman in
Bond-street, who gave him into custody. (Fine, 21, on 21 days'
imprisonment.)
FREDER1ck Johnson then assaulted policeman 106, hitting him a
“tremendous blow on the right eye and afterwards on the forehead :
also kicked his leg so violently that a serious wound was caused.”
(Fine 5, on two months' imprisonment.)
FREDERick Johnson then kicked constables, “No. 38,22, and 58, in
the groin and abdomen.” (Fine, for No. 38, 5l., on six weeks' impri-
sonment. For No. 22, 4!., or one month; and, for No. 58, 21, on 21
days' imprisonment.)
Such were the sentences passed by Mr. MAlthy, magistrate, when
the prisoner immediately vindicated the triumph of wealth, for in
the words of the reporter, “the fines were instantly paid : " Ready
money ! How like a gentleman | Let us see the account :
To a simple assault - - - - - - . & 2
To a tremendous blow dealt upon the eye of policeman, with
ditto on the head, and a serious wound in the leg - - 5

Received of Frederick Johnson, by — Maltby, Magistrate.
We put it to the most inveterate grumbler, whether England be
not a cheap country, when a man can have so much real enjoyment
for eighteen pounds; though we do really think that a handsome
discount ought to be allowed for ready money.
How gross and foul, and foolish withal, are those epicures who will
give their guinea an ounce for early strawberries—their five guineas
a pint for green peas . How evanescent the pleasure from money so
laid out ! Whereas, to kick a man in the groin and abdomen, may
afford life-long reflections of delight, inasmuch as the man so kicked
may bear an acute remembrance of the injury to the grave.
Had the hero of the present story been penniless, he would have
passed months in gaol; but being a gentleman, and therefore much
less being expected of him in the way of example to lower offenders,
he is mulcted in a sum ; and—oh, glorifying privilege of ready cash :
—“the fine is immediately paid "
What, if the wise, benevolent senators who make such laws, were
now and then kicked in the abdomen and groin–would it lead to an
alteration of the statute 1 Perhaps it might.
Should any of our readers desire to gladden their eyes with a sight
of FREDERick Johnson, his address, in the police report, runs—
“No. 5, Ely-place, Holborn, Law-student.” It would seem no man
knows the privilege of certain laws better.
AN AMERICAN BROADSIDE FOR ENGLAND.
ONE TYLER, the son, we believe, of the President of the United States,
has been making a speech, the burden of which—and the speech reads
dreadfully heavy—appears to be that he (Tyler) says no other prayers
morning, night, and noon, except to thank Heaven he is not an English-
man. We need not say that this sentiment will be universally echoed by
all who read his fuming, frothy, and vituperative speech ; for every
Briton who has any true regard for the respectability of his native
land, will loudly exclaim, “Thank Heaven, Tyler is not an Englishman 1"
We should say that this man must be a remote descendant from the re-
nowned WAT, who got his skull split by the Lord Mayor's mace, and the
crack in the head seems to have remained ever since in the family. It
is true that it is hard to descend much lower than WAT TYLER himself;
but the American edition is a terrible drop down, even from the very low
stock of the rebel of Smithfield. Tyler makes a brief confession of cer-
tain “errors of his past life,” which he admits “have been numerous,”
and which is the only sensible passage in his long harangue; but he
nevertheless again thanks Heaven for that which we again join our own
Voſ. WI-1844.
|
gratitude to his—namely, that he is not an Englishman. The concluding
remarks, in which he draws a frightful picture of the possibility of Eng-
land's being one day or other paid off by the other nations of the earth,
are quite awful; but there is one error that we cannot help noticing. If
there is any paying off, America, and particularly the men of Pennsylvania,
will be sure to have no hand in it.
A NOTE FROM MR. SILK BUCKINGHAM.
PERHAPs the universe is not aware of the fact that Mr. Silk
BuckINGHAM, when Member of the House of Commons, did, by his
burning eloquence, cause an alteration in the law which compelled
all booksellers to send a certain number of copies of every book they
published to the British Museum and the Universities. The number,
by means of Mr. SILK BuckINGHAM, was considerably lessened ;
hence—as Mr. B. has unostentatiously declared in a circular to the
trade—the booksellers are under a heavy debt of gratitude to the
projector and sole proprietor of the British and Foreign Institute.
This circular, for the convenience of subscribers, was tabularly
printed; graciously allowing the booksellers the option of subscribing
books or money towards Mr. BuckinghAM’s library of Mr. Bucking-
HAM's Institute. A second circular, of an enlarged character, is about
to be issued, and having been favoured with an early copy, we reprint
it for the benefit of Mr. BuckINGHAM, and the cause of science:—
“Mr. Silk Buckingham presents his compliments to , and”—
(here there is a very minute detail of Mr. B.'s senatorial services to lite-
rature, which, with some pain, but, for the sake of brevity, we omit). “The
subjoined table allows to the subscriber the option of shewing his gratitude
by presenting to Mr. BuckinghAM either books, money, wine, coals, or
potatoes.

We intend to look upon the above table once a night, at least
before we go to sleep ; and in our next may probably reprint it with
our donations duly inserted. It is, therefore, unnecessary to beg of
Mr. BuckINGHAM to keep a sharp eye for Punch's next.

CHAP. VI.--THE ENGLISH UNDER JENKINS.
But the prince had not calculated that there was a line of BRITI sh
INFANTRY behind the routed Irish brigade. Borne on with the hurry
of the mélée, flushed with triumph, puffing and blowing with running,
and forgetting, in the intoxication of victory, the trifling bayonet-
pricks which had impelled them to the charge, the conquering
National Guardsmen found themselves suddenly in presence of
JENKINs's Foot.
They halted all in a huddle, like a flock of sheep.
“ Up, Foot, and at then t " were the memorable words of the Duke
Jenkins, as, waving his bâton, he pointed towards the enemy, and
with a tremendous shout the stalwart sons of England rushed on 1–
Down went plume and cocked hat, down went corporal and captain,
down went grocer and tailor, under the long staves of the indomit-
able English Footmen. “A Jenkins 1 a Jenkins !” roared the Duke,
planting a blow which broke the aquiline nose of Major Arago, the
celebrated astronomer. “St. George for Mayfairl” shouted his fol-
lowers, strewing the plain with carcases. Not a man of the Guard
escaped ; they fell like grass before the mower.
“They are gallant troops, those yellow-plushed Anglais,” said the
Duke of Nemours, surveying them with his opera-glass; “’tis a pity
they wil all be cut up in half-an-hour. Concombre take your dra-
goons, and do it !” “Remember Waterloo, boys 1” said Colonel
Concombre, twirling his moustache, and a thousand sabres flashed in
the sun, and the gallant hussars prepared to attack the Englishmen.
JEN kins, his gigantic form leaning on his staff, and surveying the
havoc of the field, was instantly aware of the enemy's manoeuvre

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
His people were employed rifling the pockets of the National Guard, and had made a
tolerable booty when the great duke, taking a bell out of his pocket, (it was used for
- - º º - º - - -
-- ==º - ºt- - == -
signals in his batallion in place of fife or bugle) speedily called his scattered warriors
together. “Take the muskets of the Nationals,” said he. They did so. “Form in
square, and prepare to receive cavalry 1” By the time Concombre's regiment arrived,
he found a square of bristling bayonets with Britons behind them
The colonel did not care to attempt to break that tremendous body. “Halt 1” said
he to his men.
“FIRE 1" screamed Jenkins, with eagle swiftness; but the guns of the National
Guard not being loaded did not in consequence go off. The hussars gave a jeer of
derision, but nevertheless did not return to the attack, and seeing some of the Legi-
timist cavalry at hand, prepared to charge upon them.
The fate of those carpet warriors was soon decided. The Millefleur regiment broke
before Concombre's hussars instantaneously; the Eau de Rose dragoons stuck spurs
into their blood horses, and galloped far out of reach of the opposing cavalry: the
Eau de Cologne lancers fainted to a man, and the regiment of Concombre, pursuing
its course, had actually reached the prince and his aides-de-camp, when the clergymen
coming up formed gallantly round the Oriflame, and the bassoons and serpents
braying again, set up such a shout of canticles, and anathemas, and excommunications,
that the horses of Concombre's dragoons in turn took fright, and those warriors in
their turn broke and fled. As soon as they turned, the Vendeean riflemen fired amongst
them, and finished them—the gallant Concombre fell; the intrepid though diminutive
Cornichon, his major, was cut down; Cardon was wounded a la moelle, and the wife of
the fiery Navet was that day a widow. Peace to the souls of the brave : In defeat or
in victory, where can the soldier find a more fitting resting-place than the glorious field
of carnage? Only a few disorderly and dispirited riders of Concombre's regiment
reached Tours at night. They had left it but the day before, a thousand disciplined
and high-spirited men
Knowing how irresistible a weapon is the bayonet in British hands, the intrepid
JENKINs determined to carry on his advantage, and charged the Saugrenue Light
Infantry (now before him) with cold steel. The Frenchmen delivered a volley, of which
a shot took effect in Jenkins's cockade, but did not abide the crossing of the weapons.
“A Frenchman dies, but never surrenders,” said Saugrenue, yielding up his sword, and
his whole regiment were stabbed, trampled down, or made prisoner. The blood of
the Englishmen rose in the hot encounter. Their curses were horrible; their courage
tremendous. “On, on,” hoarsely screamed they, and a second regiment met them and
was crushed, pounded, in the hurtling grinding encounter. “A Jenkins, a Jenkins "
still roared the heroic duke, “St. George for Mayfair : " The Footmen of England
still yelled their terrific battle-cry, “Hurra, hurra !” On they went, regiment after
regiment was annihilated, until scared at the very trample of the advancing warriors,
the dismayed troops of France screaming, fled. Gathering his last warriors round
about him, Nemours determined to make a last
desperate effort. "Twas vain; the ranks met; the
next moment the truncheon of the Prince of Orleans
was dashed from his hand by the irresistible mace
of the Duke Jenkins; his horse's shins were
broken by the same weapon. Screaming with agony,
the animal fell. Jenkins's hand was at the duke's
collar in a moment, and had he not gasped out Je
me rends, he would have been throttled in that dread-
ful grasp !
Three hundred and forty-two standards, seventy-
nine regiments, their baggage, ammunition, and
treasure-chests, fell into the hands of the victorious
duke. He had avenged the honour of Old England,
and himself presenting the sword of the conquered
Nemours to Prince Henri, who now came up, the
prince, bursting into tears, fell on his neck, and
said, “Duke, I owe my crown to my patron saint
and you.” It was indeed a glorious victory, but
what will not British valour attain
The Duke of Nemours, having despatched a brief
note to Paris, saying, “Sire, all is lost except
honour !” was sent off in confinement, and in spite
of the entreaties of his captor, was hardly treated
with decent politeness. The priests and the noble
regiments who rode back when the affair was cver,
were for having the Prince shot at once, and mur-
mured loudly against “cet Anglais brutal,” who in-
terposed in behalf of his prisoner. Henri V.
granted the Prince his life, but, no doubt mis-
guided by the advice of his noble and ecclesiastical
councillors, treated the illustrious English Duke
with marked coldness, and did not even ask him to
supper that night.
“Well 1" said Jenkins, “I and my merry men
can sup alone : ” and, indeed, having had the pick
of the plunder of about 28,000 men, they had where-
withal to make themselves pretty comfortable. The
prisoners (25,403) were all without difficulty induced
to assume the white cockade. Most of them had
those marks of loyalty ready sewn in their flannel
waistcoats, where they swore they had worn them
ever since 1830. This we may believe an we will;
but the Prince Henri was too politic or too good-
humoured in the moment of victory, to doubt the
sincerity of his new subjects’ protestations, and
received the Colonels and Generals affably at his
table.
The next morning a proclamation was issued to
the united armies. “Faithful soldiers of France
and Navarre,” said the Prince, “the Saints have
won for us a great victory — the enemies of our
religion have been overcome—the lilies are restored
to their native soil. Yesterday morning at eleven
o'clock the army under my command engaged that
which was led by his Serene Highness the Duke
de Nemours. Our forces were but a third in num-
ber when compared with those of the enemy. My
faithful chivalry and nobles made the strength,
however, equal.
“The regiments of Fleur d’Orange, Millefleur,
and Eau de Cologne, covered themselves with glory
—they sabred many thousands of the enemy's
troops. Their valour was ably seconded by the
gallantry of my ecclesiastical friends; at a moment
of danger they rallied round my banner, and, for-
saking the crosier for the sword, showed that they
were of the church militant indeed.
“My faithful Irish auxiliaries conducted them-
selves with becoming heroism—but why particu-
larize when all did their duty How remember
individual acts when all were heroes?” The Mar-
shal of France, Sucre d'Orgeville, Commander of
the army of H.M. Christian Majesty, recommended
about three thousand persons for promotion; and
the indignation of Jenkins and his brave com-
panions may be imagined when it is stated that
they were not even mentioned in the despatch
As for the Princes of Ballybunion, Donegal, and

Connemara, they wrote off despatches to their government, saying,
“The Duke of Nemours is beaten, and a prisoner!” “The Irish brigade
has done it all !” on which His Majesty the King of the Irish, con-
voking his Parliament at the Corn Exchange Palace, Dublin, made a
speech, in which he called Louis Philippe an ‘old miscreant, and
paid the highest compliments to his son and his troops. The King
on this occasion knighted Sir Henry Sheehan, Sir Gavan Duffy
(whose journals had published the news); and was so delighted with
the valour of his son, that he despatched him his Order of the Pig
and Whistle (1st class), and a munificent present of five hundred
thousand pounds—in a bill at three months. All Dublin was illu-
minated ; and at a ball at the Castle, the Lord Chancellor Smith
(Earl of Smithereens), getting extremely intoxicated, called out the
Lord Bishop of Galway (the Dove), and they fought in the Phoenix
Park. Having shot the Right Reverend Bishop through the body,
Smithereens apologized. He was the same practitioner who had
rendered himself so celebrated in the memorable trial of the King—
before the Act of Independence.
Meanwhile, the army of Prince Henri advanced with rapid strides
towards Paris, whither the History likewise must hasten; for
extraordinary were the events preparing in that capital.
HANGING CLERGYMEN.
ANGING, it appears, has its abuses.
Criminals—it must be another grief
to them in their last sorrows—are
not executed with sufficient decorum.
They are hanged to be sure, but not
satisfactorily to the precisians of
Rochdale ; two thousand of whom
(their petition was presented by Mr.
S. CRAwford) have prayed the House
of Commons to turn its patriotic at-
tention to the abuses of the gallows.
The petitioners complain, that men
are hanged by “a hireling of the
sheriff,” often a vulgar person, know-
ing nothing of “due decorum or
solemnity.” Hence, as sometimes in
a playhouse tragedy, the pathos of
the scene is destroyed by a bungling
actor of the heavy business. How,
then, thought we, is this to be reme-
died ? Doubtless, the very particular
people of Rochdale would have a
Ketch College, where man might study every turn of the halter, and
take degrees upon fast, running, and slip-knots. Why should there be
a Master of Arts, and not a Master of the Gallows Wherefore should
we have M.A.'s, and not a solitary M.G. DRYDEN tells a story of
a hangman's wife, who declared that “any bungler might put a
fellow to death ; but,” she added, with conjugal vanity, pleasant and
pardonable—“it was only her husband who could make a man die
sweetly.” He was doubtless born with a genius for rope. Halters
from his boyhood were to him “familiar as his garter.”
The people of Rochdale, however, have proved themselves equal
to the occasion. They are none of your hot-blooded, unphilosophical
reformers, who have only a genius for destroying present institutions,
without brains for future improvement. If they quarrel with the
present ordinary Jack Ketch, it is only because they feel too acutely
the claims of men who should succeed him. They disdain the lay
hangman from their excessive veneration of the prison parson, for
they “prayed the House to enact, that whenever the taking of
human life was commanded to be done, under the laws of the state,
it should be performed as a religious ceremony, and by a clergyman of
the state church.” May we be permitted, with all deference, to observe,
that we think this bears somewhat hard upon the great body of the
Dissenters Religious liberty, indeed, will be but a sound, if a
culprit may not from his own pulpit choose his own hangman.
With this little drawback, easily remedied, we think the petition
of the Rochdale people full of wisdom and benevolence. To carry
out their views, it will be indispensably necessary to institute a new
professorship at Cambridge and Oxford for the proper instruction of
all clerico-hangmen. The Chair of Knots (no better name strikes
us) must be worthily filled at either college, that students of theology
and the halter may learn to hang with a decorum and decency
sufficient to satisfy the fastidious critics of Rochdale. This can easily
be effected by making the church pupil constantly practise on a
stuffed criminal. Can there be better practice for parsons than on
lay-figures 1
We must, however, make another provision. If the common peo-
ple are to be hanged by simple clergymen, who—should so dire a
necessity present itself—is to chop off the head of a peer : The
executioner is obvious: he can be no other than the Archbishop of
Canterbury. Hence, at either college must be added to the Chair of
Knots a Chair of the Chopping-Block: and as every clergyman has
a chance of the See of Canterbury, so must he take his degree not
only of the knot but of the axe. Thus, we may see appended to the
º: of reverend men, M.A.K.A.X.S.–Master of Arts, Knots, and
e8.
The country is much indebted to the wise and sensitive people of
Rochdale : we have no doubt that their wishes will be gratified, and
hanging be greatly dignified thereby. To be sure, when any new
functionary may be required for a county, it will startle us at first to
read in the Times:—
“WANTED, a Clergyman in every way fit for the Gallows.”
This, however, we shall get used to.

A CARD TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
The German Siffleur presents his compliments to the Members of
the House of Commons, and begs to call their attention to the following
‘quoted from the Times, in its report of the debate on the Factory Bill.
Mr. Collett and Mr. HARDY rose to speak, when the “noise was beyond
description — cock-crowing, cat-mewing, and similar discordant sounds
came loud and strong from each side of the House.” The German
Siffleur has heard from a private friend that, though these imitations were
very creditable to hon, members, they were nevertheless not perfect. He
therefore takes the liberty of informing them that he will, in two lessons,
so instruct Members of Parliament to bray like an ass or gaggle like a
goose, that even their dearest relatives shall not in any particular know
them from the original.
THE TRIUMPH OF REASON.
Application having been made to Louis Philippe, to the effect that he
would be pleased to cause Mr. Dyce SoMBRE—who has escaped from his
keepers to Paris—to be straightway sent back to England, his Majesty,
with his characteristic acumen, begged first to have the reports of half-a-
dozen French physicians, touching Mr. SombHE's implied madness. The
physicians one and all declared that Mr. Dyce SoMBRE showed the strongest
symptoms of sanity (for an Englishman), for he was throwing about heaps
of money for the encouragement of French ingenuity and French com-
merce. If, however, any doubt could remain of the gentleman's mental
health, that doubt was wholly set at rest by him a few nights ago, when
he gave a most magnificent supper to upwards of five hundred people.
The French authorities very properly considered this to be the triumph
of reason. Mr. Dyce SoMBRE remains in Paris.

Should the man sentenced to death in Louisiana be really hanged, it is
the intention of the Americans to further adorn the national flag by
quartering a gibbet proper among the stripes and stars.

THE vigilant eye of Punch, ever watching the various phases of society,
has observed with intense interest the creation of a new Privileged Class,
solemnly recognised by the Peers of the Realm in Parliament assembled,
and invested with the peculiar power of breaking the Law without
incurring its penalties. So lofty a prerogative at once approaches the
class in question to our proudest Nobility; with whom it only remains
to associate them more intimately by some Honorary Insignia, akin to
those which decorate the shoulder, breast, and leg of a Norfolk, a Somerset,
or a Richmond.
Accordingly, Punch, ardently invoking the assistance of Garter, Lion,
Ulster, and Clarencieux, begs most humbly and deferentially to suggest
to the Fountain of all Honour the following propositions:
THAT there be instituted a New Order, to be called the Most Honour-
able and Aristocratic Order of the Turf: the members of which,
commonly known as Sporting Men, shall have the exclusive privilege of
Betting, to any amount, on the
Race Course, or at the Corner, on
any day of the week, with abso-
lute impunity; and in the face of
any laws, Divine or Human, now
extant or to be hereafter enacted,
for the Prevention of Gambling,
or for the Better Observance of
the Sabbath.
THAT there be a Second Class,
to be called Companions of the
Most Honourable and Aristocratic
Order of the Turf; and that
Tradesmen be admissible as Com-
panions.
THAT therebe also a Third Class,
to be called Companions of the
Companions of the Most Honour-
able and Aristocratic Order of the
Turf; and that grooms, jockeys,
stable-boys, keepers of E. O. and
roulette tables, and gambling-
booths ; thimble-riggers, sporting
pettifoggers, coachmen and cads,
licensed and unlicensed victuallers,
the members of the Fancy in gene-
ral, and the Swell Mob, be eligible
as Companions of the Companions.
THAT the three several Classes
shall each wear an appropriate
Costume, with Insignia, as follows:
First Class. – A round Cap, of
Party-coloured silk, with a large
shade in front, and a gilt horseball
on the top. The Mantle to be of
Levantine, say yellow with blue or pink sleeves, and richly
embroidered on the shoulder with the Crest of the Order—A
Swan, plongeant, in dirty water, with its black-legs up in the air.
On Collar days, a necklace of threadled horse-shoes, with the
Badge, viz., a regular Cross, with a Horse's Head, hard held, in
the centre, and encircled by the Motto, “The Race is not to the
| Sucift.”
Second Class.- A short mantle and hood, of drab horse-cloth,
bound with red. The hood to come over the head and face down
to the tip of the nose, with two large round holes for the eyes.
|The Collar, an equestrian one, of leather, with a ring of bells.
|Badge, the Hand-in-hand, with the Motto, “Nob and Snob.”
Third Class.-The best costume they can buy, beg, steal,
borrow, or make. On Collar days, a Horse's Halter round the
| neck, with the Badge, A Thimble encircled by a Garter, with
the Motto, “Indemnity for the Past, and Security for the Future.”
! --> The number of Knights of the First Class to be equal to that
of the Commanders, Naval and Military, who for eminent
public Services, have been rewarded with the Ribbons and
Crosses of the Bath.
* | The number of the Second and Third Classes to be limited
only by the Accommodation afforded to them by the Subscrip-
|tion Rooms, Yards, Corners, Courses, Rings, Grand Stands, and
Standing-Room, or what is commonly called the Turf.
BALL ADS OF THE HEART.
My heart is like a wither'd nut,
Its surface do not trust,
Though smooth and sound it seems when shut,
Within is only dust.
When time the crackers shall apply,
The world will know too well,
The thousand memories that lie
Enkernell'd in the shell.
But wherefore should I murmur thus !
The world is very wide;
My heart shall be an omnibus,
And carry twelve inside.
"Tis true, that on the way, perchance,
Some to drop off begin;
But can we not, as we advance,
Take many others in
Some hearts, like cabs, besides themselves,
To one or two incline;
But omnibuses carry twelves,
Such be this heart of mine !
A CHANCE FOR BROUGHAM.
Lord Bnough AM finding the 2000l. presidency of the Privy
Council Amendment Bill to be—what is technically termed
—“no go,” intends, we believe, making an effort to get an
appointment under the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act. As we
perceive the Court of Peculiars is to be reconstructed, we think
that the very peculiar conduct of Lord Brough AM points him
out as the very fittest person to act as President of the Court
alluded to.
A New Robrespierre I
The Morning Post more than hints that Tom Duncombs—who,
since the O'Connell banquet, has been wholly given up by his
aristocratic friends—may be considered as the future Robespie RRE,
It is not generally known, adds (or might add) the Post, that Mr
Duncombe is so deeply imbued with the horrid principles of the
French monster, that he invariably has his hair cut by means of a
toy guillotine.
Ministers keep their Appointments.
The Ministerial Papers announce that “the Postmaster-General
intends resigning, as soon as arrangements are perfected for his
successor’” The rumour is rife that Rowland HILL has been
appointed ; but this honourable method of rewarding merit would
be introducing such a novelty into the system of ministerial appoint-
ments, that we must say we do not believe it. If this were established
as a precedent, How could Sir Robert PRRL form a Ministry 1

which Mr. T. P. Cooke, the
only recognised British seaman,
would very properly describe as
an act “unworthy of the name
of a Tar, who would rather see
all his own timbers irrevocably shivered
than run down a craft with a helpless female at
the figure-head, when he ought to be piping all
hands for the protection of lonely, defenceless,
and, of course, virtuous woman.”
Punch, ever anxious to combat against humbug
of every description, and to rush into the thickest
of the fight, has called upon one of his artists to
draw the sword, which has been accordingly
drawn; and it is hoped that our cut of this sword
is more to the purpose than any cut the sword will
ever give in the hands of its intended owner. The
hilt represents Queen Pomare, whom the French
admiral endeavoured to make a handle of. On the
blade is another representation of her Tahitian
Majesty, kneeling before Thouars, who, with a
littleness that quite justifies his praenomen of
Petit, is waving insultingly over her that most
obtrusive bit of rag, which was formerly respected
as the tricolor, but which is sadly soiled and de-
graded by some of the hands it has since fallen
into. The scabbard is covered with various em-
blematical designs, headed by a little monstrosity ºf
intended to signify Young France, who, if not both #1
“old enough and ugly enough" to take care of *
itself, certainly possesses the latter of these two
requisites for self-protection. The other devices are em-
blematical of the object for which the sword is given ;
but the admiral himself is typified by the inside, which, as
the sword is out of the scabbard, conveys the idea of
absolute emptiness.
In taking leave of the admiral and his sword, we subjoin
a short list of subscriptions, which our own correspondent

The Iting of Prussia and his Friend the Czar.
The KING of PRussia has at length crowned his reputation. In ami.
able compliance with the wishes of the Emperor of Russia, he has not only
routed the Poles from Posen, but has renewed a reciprocal convention to
give up all deserters from the Czar. A grand historical picture is ordered
at Berlin to commemorate this amity. Hitherto, the two kings of Brent-
ford, “smelling one nosegay,” has been thought the beau idéal of the
friendship of monarchs. This picture, however, will be wholly eclipsed
by the forthcoming work of the painter, which will represent Prussia and

SIR ROBERT PEEL TO PUNCH.
My dear Punch,
The Morning Chronicle tells a story of a man being refused the
farm of “one of the {j because the farmer was a Liberal and a
Dissenter; the landlord's agent observing, that “the tenant of the farm
must go both to church º poll with his landlord.”. To this story the
editor adds the following note:– “Our correspondent has given us
his name and address, and the names of the landlord, the agent, and the
party who proposed to become tenant of the farm.” Now, Mr. Editor,
why does the editor treasure up the information—why does he not give
the names of landlord, agent, and would-be tenant? ... I am induced to put
this question from the fact of at least twenty people having asked me if I
was the landlord
Pray get the Chronicle to speak out—'tis always best.
And believeme, yours ever,
Robert PEEL.
P.S. By the way, you have been hitting us a little too hard of late.
Lay it on now to the Whigs.
P.S. No. 2. I open my letter to inform you that I have just now a nice
little clerkship in the Treasury open. I hear you have a very interesting
godson not yet provided for. N.B. Don't forget the Whigs.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.
DURING the whole performance of the Taming of the Shrew, in five
acts at the Haymarket Theatre, Mr. Sruart sits in one corner of the
stage, as the Lord before whom the play is acted. Nothing can be finer
than the acting of Mr. Stuart from first to last, in the very arduous
character assigned to him. There is something truly Shaksperian in his
treatment of the wand which he holds in his hand, and which he twiddles
about, from time to time, between his fingers, with a nice appreciation of the
highly dramatic situation into which he is thrown by the towering genius
of the Swan of Avon. In the fourth act, Mr.SIUART rests his right arm on an
adjacent chair : but the point we admired most was, the truly Elizabethan
jerk he gave to his left leg in the middle of the banquet scene.
We understand that a deputation from the Shakspeare Society intend
waiting on Mr. Stuart, to thank him for the zeal with which he has
adhered to the original text, by not opening his mouth. But it will be
suggested to him, that a wink at Katharina, in the third act, might be
introduced with effect, as showing that the Lord before whom the play
is acted might be trying to gain the attention of the very pretty woman
who is representing the principal female character.
A vote of thanks is nightly proposed in the Green-room to Mr. Stuarr,
for his able, impartial, and unimpassioned conduct in the chair: and we
have heard it intimated that he will be offered an engagement at Covent
Garden Theatre, as Chairman at all the League meetings.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
3Bundb's QCourt Circular.
ARAGRAphs have gone the round of the
papers stating that the Palace at Kew is
to be converted into
a royal nursery, be-
cause “the children
are rather in the
way ” “ of HER
MAJESTYand Prince
ALBERT. We are
authorized to state
that this is not the
fact. The idea of
putting the poor in-
fants into the vast
and dreary abode
alluded to is almost
as bad as the notion
of the cruel uncle in
the Children in the
Wood, who, if we remember rightly,
took a little boy and girl into a forest
and left them there, when the robin
red-breasts went and looked after
them. We presume that a company
of grenadiers would be stationed, to perform the
friendly office of the robin red-breasts, if the Prince
and Princesses were consigned to the dreary soli-
tude of Kew — its ravines, woods, asparagus-beds,
dells, thickets, alcoves, hand-frames, forests, conser-
vatories, mignionette-boxes, fastnesses, and flower-
pots. The royal chickens are, however, not to be
cooped up at Kew, a fact which we are happy to be
d enabled to state on our own exclusive authority. So
far from the Prince of Wales and the Princesses being
“in the way” of their illustrious parents, it is well known that the family
circle at the Palace presents a domestic picture which would do credit to
the Joneses, the Browns, the Smiths, or even the Robinsons. Her MAJESTY
has been heard to say, in allusion to the report of the infants being as it
were turned out to grass in Kew Gardens, that it would be like thrusting
a needle into a bottle of hay, for if they were at large in a place like
Kew, instead of being as they now are, continually under her maternal
eye, she would never know where to look for them. It is true the swing
in Buckingham Palace Gardens has once or twice compelled HER MAJESTY
and her illustrious Consort to “dodge it” when they saw it coming, to
prevent any direct blow being given to the crown, but this difficulty has
since been avoided, by cutting off a portion of the poultry-yard, and erect-
ing a round-about, as well as the swing on the site lately occupied by a
water-butt, erected by William the Fourth in commemoration of the
element on which he had served as a midshipman.
MAN-SHOOTING IN AMERICA.
A LATE file of New York papers gives a very particular account of
a duel-murder committed by a Mr. MAY, who sent a rifle-ball through
the forehead of his opponent, Mr. CochRAN. The whole affair was
arranged in a most orderly manner. Mr. CochRAN and his friend
left Washington “in a coach with four white horses,” doubtless a
graceful hint of the purity of the duellist's intentions. Mr. MAY and
his friend arrived more modestly, in a single coach. Articles of war
were then courteously drawn up between the seconds of the parties,
and duly signed. The weapons were rifles — distance, fifty paces.
The principals were “perfectly composed ;” as men prepared for
murder ought, doubtless, to be. Mr. Cochran “refused to take a
glass of liquor,” but continued to “sing little snatches of songs.”
In another minute a rifle-ball was in his brain, and his murderer
was scampering from the field. The projected duel was known to
the whole city, and there are really stern thinkers in America, who,
according to the papers, “unhesitatingly say the civil authorities ought
to have been called upon to arrest the parties, and thus prevented
the deed.”
The “civil authorities” were by far too civil to do anything of the
kind. Indeed, had Messrs. Cochran and MAY thought of the
courtesy and sent the authorities an invitation to attend the ground,
we can hardly think they would have failed to come. The whole
transaction was complete; nothing was omitted that might not have
done honour to the Cherokees or Chippewaws in their wildest and
* Wide Cheltenham Looker-on,
most picturesque onslaughts. Yes, there was an omission, which,
we trust, will, in all future duels that end fatally, be remedied. It is
this—Mr. May ought to have scalped his victim: to be sure, he
breathed for some hours afterwards, but never mind that. The
successful duellist has, we think, a just right to the scalp of his prey,
and should be permitted to sport it in society, as though it were a
riband or an order. Folks who tolerate the duellist could scarcely
curl the nose at the most unequivocal evidence of his triumph.
PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY.
THE other evening widow Brown invited me
To take herself and daughters to the play;
Of course I vowed the compliment delighted me—
Although the truth was quite the other way.
“Perhaps,” she coolly added, “you'll contrive too,”
(My spirit sank—I knew what she to say meant—)
- ??
“When you secure your place, to take our five too:
She never said a word about repayment 1
I'd hopes the tickets might on tick be got,
Which on the Office would put off the do;
But Mr. Parsons sternly told me not,
And called for—six times seven—forty-two—
Which I produced. And ever since that day
I've watched for pegs, her conversation's drift in,
For introducing, in a graceful way,
Some light allusion to my One pound Fifteen.
In vain. She foils me with a veteran's keenness,
And now I think she's getting up a quarrel.
Mortals, my tale is told; confessed my greenness :-
I need not point so palpable a moral.
THE COMFORT OF “KNOWING THE WORST.”
At the Huntingdon Assizes,GirrorDWhite, aged 18, wassentenced
to transportation for life for sending a letter to a farmer, threatening
to burn his farm, and the farms of others. Lord Asingen passed
sentence, and said, “the sending of letters threatening to burn the
property of the parties to whom they were addressed was worse than
the putting the threat itself into execution, for when a man lost his
property by fire he at least knew the worst; but he to whom such threats
were made was made to live in a state of continual terror and alarm.”
Hence, instructed by Lord ABINGER, let future Giffond WHITEs
spare their pens and ink, and at once make use of lucifer matches.
For, as it is a lighter offence to destroy property than merely to
threaten its destruction, the Gifford White who actudly burns
the farm may get off with transportation for fourteen years ;
whilst if, with greater villany, he merely makes a threat, he is very
properly condemned a slave for life.
In our last number, we reported the result of a trial of the Rev.
Mr. Day, who plunged a knife in the thighs of seven sheep that tres-
passed in his close. Lord ARINGER feelingly put it to the jury,
whether the reverend gentleman did not torture the animals out of
pure ignorance of the law; being a clergyman, he of course had no
time to study the statutes He was acquitted. We do not plead for
an acquittai of Giffond WHITE, for of course his education and
position in society must have made him intimately acquainted with
the statutes, which he knew he was infringing. However, according
to the judge, he has one comfort in his misery—at least, he “knows
the worst;” and that we think may possibly consist in the fact of his
having been tried by Lord ARINGER.
Tried Brandy.
At the last Gloucestershire adjourned Sessions, a girl was placed at the
bar, charged with stealing a pint of brandy (it was produced in court) from
her master. The girl was acquitted; but the jury, with exemplary partiality,
not only tried the girl, but the brandy, too; for they conscientiously
emptied the bottle. The liquor being drunk, the jury appended to their
verdict—“below proof.”
The Emperor of Russia's Visit to England.
The news of this glad event has given delight to the denizens of New-
gate, who have petitioned the Governor that they may, on the arrival of
the Emperor, illuminate at their own expense the outside of the gaol with
| the touching word—"Welcome 1”

TELL INTELLIGIBLY TOLD.
Overture's finished with sound and with
fury,
The *in ascends on the Canton of Uri,
The village of Burgher—the torrent's vast
swell,
With a bridge and a boat, and the cottage
of Tell.
A picture complete such as none could achieve,
But the pencils of T and of double U GRIEve.
Some peasants are forming some fanciful bowers,
By means of a bundle of property flowers,
While Lutern is trying to shoot with a bow,
In a style we can only describe as so so.
'Tis Miss Alberrazzi, who seems rather stupid
At handling the arrows of any, but Cupid.
In public, at least, she’s devoid of the skill
That's needed for bending a bow to her will ;
There's Tell in the foreground, in front of his hovel,
He most sentimentally leans on a shovel ;
With love of his country amazingly big,
And waiting to give to her tyrants a dig.
There's Martha, his wife, on a three-legged stool,
With some property wicker-work, taking it cool.
Suppos'd to be making a basket, but, pooh!
It's not what a singer's expected to do :
So into a tangle the wicker-work gets
In the hands of the donna seconda, Miss BETTs.
A chorus of peasants, they say that the sun
O'er mountain and river is taking a run,
And over the hills in his manner politest
Is very obligingly beaming his brightest.
But here is a fisherman, listen and harlº,
'Tis BARRER comes on at the back in a Bark;
And by way of increasing the force of the pun,
In the rôle done by BARKER a barcarole's done.
The fisherman sings, the example is set,
Tell, Lutern, and Martha, make up the quartett;
Of different matters they’re all of them singing–
Of liberty, love, and of grief the heart wringing.
As if, by-the-bye, with the weight of its woes,
Tears are wrung from the heart, like the water from clothes.
The famed Ranz des Vaches in the distance we hear,
*Tis the music to cows, and their kindred so dear.
The air must, of course, be exceedingly wide of
The tune which 'tis commonly said the cow died of.
Now over the platforms and tressels behind,
Through canvas recesses two gentlemen wind ;
At length to the footlights they’ve wended their way,
And one is—Oh, who could mistake him 1–Duphez.
But no ; it is Arnold ; his bearing and mien
Have instantly made him a part of the scene.
Curiosity lately so highly was wrought,
Qf the star of the evening alone we had thought.
He enters 1—DuPREz from our fancy has fled,
And Arnold, of Melcthal, is there in his stead.
We anxiously wait till the rest are all gone;
'Tis he that enslaves our attention alone.
He sings—though his accent is foreign—and though
He makes in the text a slight blunder or so—
Such as talking about the eternal disgrace
Of having betrayed—not his “faith,” but his “face;”
The actor is too much in earnest by half,
To leave e'en his errors exposed to a laugh.
The language of genius always is known,
It does what it likes with a tongue not its own.
He sings of the griefs that his senses bewilder,
His duty—his country—his love for Matilda,
Whom once from the avalanche he has defended ;
But rather piano it must have descended:
Or else, with the very best will in the world,
In trying to stem it—he must have been hurl’d
(Within the most rational limits to speak),
Right into the midst of the proximate week.
He closes the recitative with a swell
On the note called B flat—when in toddles Tell
Who straightway commences the splendid moreeau;
The duet, Dore Vai, which all of us know ;
Their country, its fetters and tyrants, they sing about,
When Tell, his pet subject desirous to bring about,
Gives hints quite enough Arnold's brain to bewilder,
Divided 'twixt patriotism and 'tilda.
At length, with a splendid exertion of voice,
He declares on the former has fall'n his choice.
The peasants return, and the ballet go through,
A very indifferent movement or two,
To take the attention from Lutern, who tries
To shoot at the mark in the hope of a prize ;
He wins, and, the fact leaves no room for disputing,
The Canton must need a few lessons in shooting.
However, they swear that by Tell and his son
The cause of their country is sure to be won,
Because ALBERTAzzi has fasten’d a dart
In a target not more than ten paces apart.
Some soldiers now enter, pursuing a Swiss,
One Luthold, who's been after something amiss ;
Such as giving a soldier of Gesler some cracks
With the end of a terrible (property) axe.
Tell gets in the cause most amazingly warm ;
And though there are signs of a horrible storm,
He rescues the Swiss, and is straightway afloat
In some quarter inch profiling cut like a boat. -
The canvas is shaken, with energy warm,
In order to give an idea of a storm;
When Tell is dragged off—at top entrance P.S
We see him in pasteboard grown frightfully less.
The peasants then watch with the greatest suspense
A neatly done picture, which makes a pretence
Of reaching in safety the opposite shore ;
But it is dragg'd through a hole in the canvas, no more.
“He is saved, he is saved 1" cry the chorus with fury,
º: asses they are in the Canton of Uri !
o foam and to fume, and to storm and to vapour,
About a small boat that is cut out of paper.)
The soldiers of Gesler sing quite the reverse,
The rebel they lustily set to and curse ;
Each party is trying in noise to be greater:
The elegant epithets “coward” and “traitor.”
From one side to t'other are constantly bandied,
In a style that is equally graceful and candid.
And when they’ve sufficiently threaten’d and curs'd,
The curtain descends on the end of
Act FIRST.

PUNCH*S REVIEW.
4 Bill of Costs, folio, 1844, pp. 8.
Ills of Costs are not frequently the subject for
review, but we are actuated by a desire
| to introduce to the public some of those
Curiosities of Legal Experience which have
fallen under our own immediate notice. The
Bill now before us is on the lively and ex-
citing topic of AN Action on PRomises.
The authors—for there are two of them, who
have done for Costs what Beaumont and
Fletcher did for Comedy—evince an energy,
a vigour, or, in one word, a grasp, such as
few practitioners can surpass, though many
may equal.
The Bill begins with an ordinary passage,
--- that calls for little remark. It merely chron-
\ \\ icles an attendance in simple language, and

In the few passages we have quoted
above the reader is carried backwards
and forwards from the chambers of the
Counsel to the residence of the client, and
thence to the office of the attorney, with
a rapidity that is truly wonderful. Here
the hand of the artist is conspicuously
shown, for while nothing actually occurs
but a conference with counsel, the scene
is so frequently changed, and the phrase-
ology so skilfully varied, that we almost
forget the monotonous repetition of the
6 and 8, in the sort of moving panorama
through which the text has hurried us.
Passing over some intermediate touches of peculiar boldness, we come
to one of the most remarkable in tances of solicitorial adroitness that are
to be met with in the entire anna's of Chancery experience. The subject
is the attempt to serve a subpoena on one Brown, whom the Lawyers appear
to have sought with a vigour only to be equalled by the tact with which they
happened to look after him in all the places where the sequel proved there
was no chance of his being met with. The touching little incident of
“the boy,” who finds Brown at once without any trouble, is most artisti-
cally brought in at the end, instead of being introduced at the beginning,

We here bring to a conclusion a review of one of the most remarkable
legal productions of the present age—an age that is peculiarly rich in
matters of the same character. It wants, perhaps, the delicacy of Dax—

with a document more likely to interest clients, and “show them how a

we thought we might to-morrow 6 8 have got one case, are never likely to get another, and are anxious to
make the most of the one they have got, the Bill of Costs before us is
deserving of a place in every lawyer's office. Indeed, we might go fur-

It will be seen that preparatory to the Royal sojourn at the Isle of

being known, he was beset, on his landing, by an enormous troop of

invariably applied to the luggage of the passengers. The carpet-bag

his umbrella had already been thrown into the Prince of Wales's

pluie, and, after a struggle, obtained its restitution. The extreme
privacy of the visit of the Prince occasioned his being met by the
inhabitants, not with loyal addresses, but with some twenty or thirty

The
HISTORY of THE NEXT FRENCH REVOLUTION.
[From a forthcoming History of Europe.]
CHAP. VII.--THE LEAGUER OF PARIS.
By a singular coincidence, on the very same day, when the armies
of Henri V. appeared before Paris from the Western Road, those
of the Emperor John Thomas Napoleon arrived from the North.
Skirmishes took place between the advanced guards of the two
parties, and much slaughter ensued.
“Bon f" thought King Louis Philippe, who examined them from his
tower; “they will kill each other; this is by far the most economical
way of getting rid of them.” The astute monarch's calculations were
admirably exposed by a clever remark of the Prince of Ballybunion.
“Faix, Harry,” says he (with a familiarity which the punctilious son
of Saint Louis resented), “you and him yandther, the Emperor I
mane, are like the Kilkenny cats, dear.”
“Et que font-ils ces chats de Kilkigny, Monsieur le Prince de Bally-
bunion 3" asked the most Christian King haughtily.
Prince Daniel replied by narrating the well-known apologue of the
animals “ating each other all up but their teels, and that’s what you
and Imparial Pop yondther will do, blazing away as ye are,” added
the jocose and royal boy.
“Je prie rotre Altesse Royale de vaguer à ses propres affaires,” answered
Prince Henri sternly, for he was an enemy to anything like a joke;
but there is always wisdom in real wit, and it would have been well
for His Most Christian Majesty had he followed the facetious coun-
sels of his Irish ally.
The fact is, the King, Henri, had an understanding with the garri-
sons of some of the forts, and expected all would declare for him.
Ilowever, of the twenty-four forts which we have described, eight
only, and by the means of Marshal Soult, who had grown extremely
devout of late years, declared for Henri, and raised the white flag:
while eight others, seeing Prince John Thomas Napoleon before them
in the costume of his revered predecessor, at once flung open their
gates to him, and mounted the tricolor with the eagle : the
remaining eight, into which the Princes of the blood of Orleans had - - -
commander. And it must be confessed that these intrepid footmen
thrown themselves, remained constant to Louis Philippe. Nothing
could induce that Prince to quit the Tuileries. His money was
there, and he swore he would remain by it. In vain his sons offered
to bring him into one of the forts, he would not stir without his
treasure; they said they would transport it t ither ; but no, no ; the
- -. - ----->

patriarchal monarch, putting his finger to his aged nose, and winking
archly, said, “he knew a trick worth two of that,” and resolved
to abide by his bags.
The theatres and cafés remained open as usual : the funds rose
three centimes. The Journal des Débats published three editions of
different tones of politics: one, the Journal de l'Empire, for the Napo-
leonites; the Journal de la Légitimité, another very complimentary to
the legitimate monarch ; and finally, the original edition bound heart
and soul to the dynasty of July. The poor editor, who had to write
all three, complained not a little that his salary was not raised : but
the truth is, that, by altering the names, one article did indifferently
for either paper. The Duke of Brittany, under the title of Louis
XVII., was always issuing manifestoes from Charenton, but of these
the Parisians took little heed—the Charirari proclaimed itself his
gazette, and was allowed to be very witty at the expense of the
three Pretenders.
As the country had been ravaged for a hundred miles round, the
respective Princes of course were for throwing themselves into the
forts, where there was plenty of provision, and, when once there, they
speedily began to turn out such of the garrison as were disagreeable
to them, or had an inconvenient appetite, or were of a doubtful
fidelity. These poor fellows, turned into the road, had no choice
but starvation; as to getting into Paris, that was impossible. A
mouse could not have got into the place, so admirably were the
forts guarded, without having his head taken off by a cannon ball.
Thus the three conflicting parties stood, close to each other, hating
each other, “willing to wound and yet afraid to strike”—the victuals
in the forts, from the prodigious increase of the garrisons, getting
smaller every day. As for Louis Philippe in his palace, in the centre
of the twenty-four forts, knowing that a spark from one might
set them all blazing away, and that he and his money-bags might be
blown into eternity in ten minutes, you may fancy his situation was
not very comfortable.
But his safety lay in his treasure. Neither the Imperialists nor
the Bourbonites were willing to relinquish the two hundred and fifty
billions in gold; nor would the Princes of Orleans dare to fire upon
that considerable sum of money, and its possessor, their revered
father. How was this state of things to end ? The Emperor sent a
note to his Most Christian Majesty (for they always styled each other
in this manner in their communications), proposing that they should
turn out and decide the quarrel sword in hand, to which proposition
Henri would have acceded, but that the priests, his ghostly coun-
sellors, threatened to excommunicate him should he do so. Hence
this simple way of settling the dispute was impossible.
The presence of the holy fathers caused considerable annoyance in
the forts. Especially the poor English, as Protestants, were subject
to much petty persecution, to the no small anger of JEN KINs, their
were not so amenable to discipline as they might have been. Re-
membering the usages of merry England, they clubbed together, and
swore they would have four meals of meat a day, wax candles in the
casemates, and their porter. These demands were laughed at. The
priests even called upon them to fast on Fridays, on which a general
mutiny broke out in the regiment; and they would have had a fourth
standard raised before Paris—viz. that of England – but the garri-
son proving too strong for them, they were compelled to lay down
their sticks; and, in consideration of past services, were permitted
to leave the forts. 'Twas well for them as you shall hear.
The Prince of Ballybunion and the Irish force were quartered in
the fort which, in compliment to them, was called Fort Potato, and
where they made themselves as comfortable as circumstances would

the halfpenny that one of them somehow had) for vast sums of
money, for which they gave their notes of hand. The warriors of
their légion would stand round delighted ; and it was, “Musha,
Masther Dan, but that's a good throw !” “Good luck to you,
Misther Pat, and throw thirteen this time !” and so forth. But this
sort of inaction could not last long. They had heard of the treasures
amassed in the Palace of the Tuileries; they sighed when they
thought of the lack of bullion in their green and beautiful country.
They panted for war ! They formed their plan.
LORD BROUGHAM ON WET-NURSES.
THE very word Bnough AM is such a spell to conjure up a host
of recollections, all of them glorifying and uplifting humanity, that
we never see his Lordship's name in a Parliamentary Report without
the deepest and sweetest emotion. And then it is so like his Lord-
ship to go even out of his way to do good. He is not content, like
many of his brother Peers, to dwell in the “inevitable decencies”
of life ; oh, no he must be up, and stirring, and talking—piling with
his peculiar genius epithet upon epithet, building verbal Babels—
whilst other degenerate Peers are satisfied to breathe “Content,” or
“Not Content,” as the sole exertion of senatorial life.
The Commons' debate on the Factory Bill was not to pass away
without notable comment by Lord Brough AM. The Bill, involv-
ing serious human interests, was certain to bring out the “poor man's
friend.” As well expect the wind to sweep over a stringed instru-
ment and awaken no sound, as think to find the heart of Brough AM
mute to the voice of humanity. Hear his Lordship's brief, yet modest
and touching character of himself:-
“He who had always exerted himself to promote the comfort of the people—he who
merer in his life had given a vote, or written a line, or said a word, that tended to their
oppression or neglect—but who had endeavoured, through good report and evil report, to
do whatsoever he could to serve their best interests, temporary or permanent—he, who
had studied to keep up the rate of their wages, and to keep down the price of their
food—he,” &c. &c. &c.
He, then, had an especial right to be heard upon the Factory Bill,
although not yet presented to their Lordships. The philanthropist
then proceeded to dilate upon the misery suffered by those “engaged
in unhealthy occupations”—those who “laboured heavily, and were
too lightly fed.” Their condition was very bad, but then there was
this comfort in it; it resulted “from the mysterious decrees and
inscrutable dispensations of Providence ſ” Lord BRough AM can be
tainted by no such suspicion, but we fear there are men, cosey,
comfortable persons, who themselves too often make the peculiar
Providence whose “mysterious decrees” they then so much lament.
There is such an impiety as making Providence the scape-goat of our
own hardness of heart and ingrained selfishness.
The poor man's friend—what a comprehensive mind the giant
has l—next touched upon the suckling of children. It had been
stated by the advocates of the Ten Hours' Bill that the women
employed in the factories could not suckle their children. Where-
upon, with a look anticipative of victory, “the poor man's friend"—
“would ask how many wives, and sisters, and daughters of their lordships, and of
members of the other house of Parliament, voluntarily exempted themselves from
following what, in this respect, was called the first law of nature? They excused them-
selves from undertaking that duty, because their rarious arocations inter/ered with it.
Yet they had never heard that any mischief resulted from the practice, but they were
told that the children of women employed in factories were swept down in scores in
consequence of their mothers not being able to attend to them.”
The wives, and sisters, and daughters of their lordships, the
mothers, whose morning calls, and attendance at drawing rooms,
evening parties, Almacks, and whose other “various avocations”
deny to them the sweet pleasure of suckling their own children,
do, nevertheless, contrive to insure to their babes, in the words of
advertising nurses, “a healthy breast of milk :” therefore, it is
possible, that a Marquess in his swaddling-clothes may never miss his
Duchess mother, albeit the lady is at the opera or the palace. Conse-
quently, in the case of the said Marquess, or any other baby nobles,
we never, in the words of Brougham, “hear that any mischief results
from the practice.” How, then, asks his lordship, can any injury
fall to the babes of factory women, since the children of Duchesses
thrive and in good time become legislators, though they have never
known the taste of their own mothers' milk His lordship, giant as he
is in intellect, could not conceive it possible that the factory women
were unable, like the aforesaid Duchesses, to hire wet-nurses for their
children, whilst they, the mothers, were engaged in their twelve-
hour “avocations” at the mill. And yet, wet-nurses they do hire, or
rather buy, and their names are “Opium,” “Godfrey's Cordial,” and
“Gin.” Lord Brougham was ignorant of this fact; this is evident
enough ; for when was he ever known to garble, and mis-state, and
confound things and dates, to make out his case ? Never. His lord-
ship, when he touched upon the fact of the ladies of the aristocracy
leaving their children to the breasts of others, with “no mischief
resulting from the practice,” had, of course, not read the speech of
Lord AshLEY. As, however, Lond Bhough AM is an attentive
reader of Punch, we quote the following that it may meet his eye:—
“The children are much confided by factory-mothers to the care of others Opium is
administered to the infants, in rarious forms, to keep them still. This practice is so
general, that in Manchester, ‘Godfrey's cordial’, and other similar preparations, are in
great demand, and are sold at numerous shops. 'The quantity of this pernicious drug
(opium) thus consumed,” says my informant, “would almost stagger belief. Many -
infants are so habituated to it, that they can scarcely exist when deprived of the
stimulus. Immense numbers fall victims to hydrocrphalus; the mother's milk be-
comes deteriorated; infants are fed by substitutes in her absence; and hence arise
many internal disorders, the usual remedy for which is gin. Among other things, the
(the mothers) complain of the intolerable pain of their breasts, in consequence of s
long absence from their children.” -
We put it to those who have watched the habits of Lord
BRough AM, whether, had he read the above, he would have been, if
we may imitate his own redundant richness of language, so cross, so
impudent, so shuffling, so tricksy, so empirical, so insulting to the
miseries of the factory-mother, as to hazard a comparison between
her and the mothers of marquesses, and earls, and lords Would he,
for one moment, have likened the healthy, hired nurse, with a good
breast of milk, duly approved by the family physician, to the opium,
Godfrey's cordial, and gin, that for a time keep factory babies
“still,” and, in due season, kill them with hydrocephalus Lond
Brough AM knew nothing of this ; otherwise, he would have
perished rather than have put forth the falsehood; he is such a “poor
man's friend,” and this last speech is so very unlike the usual oratory
of the learned and benevolent lord.
As for the sufferings of the poor, “they are bad enough,” says Lord
Brough AM—they “are to be lamented ; ” nevertheless, they cannot
be helped ; no, they are a part of the same providence that showers
down pensions, and presidencies of councils, and other amenities.
We must be content, says the cheerful philosophy of Lord
BRough AM, to take the good with the evil ; a resignation the more
easy to those whose luck it is to have the unmixed good. It is these
people we presume who, according to FIELDING, bear their neigh-
bours' misfortunes like Christians.
We have dwelt somewhat at length upon this subject lest, what at
first appears a gross and heartless sophistry on the part of Lord
Brough AM, should be confounded with his usual mode of attack and
defence. We have wished to show that as relates to the compara-
tive services of wet-nurses to the rich and the poor, Lord BronghAM
spoke in utter ignorance of Lond AshLEY's speech. We had also
another motive. Reports having been industriously circulated
respecting the nursing of Lord BRough AM himself, we were
anxious to take a marked opportunity of denying their verity. It is
not true, then, that Lond BRough AM when a baby (BRough AM a
baby 1) refused the sweetness of human milk, and was brought up
on vinegar and the juice of gall-nuts.
HORRID BORE.
MR. PUNCH,
SIR,--I reside in May Fair, and I write to complain to you of a
monstrous nuisance existing in my neighbourhood. I allude to the crying
of mackarel and oranges so early as ten o'clock in the morning. These
noises are an intolerable interference with the repose of the superior
classes; and I should like to know what the lower orders would say if the
hours, which they think proper to devote to sleep, were broken in upon in
a similar manner.
In connexion with this subject, there is another point which I am
desirous of mentioning, although I am quite aware that it is of a delicate
nature. Undoubtedly, it is very right and proper that people should go
to Church, and some means of summoning them to service must, of
course, be resorted to. I do not at all object to bells at reasonable hours,
but I must say that to begin ringing them at eleven o'clock on a Sunday,
in a district, to the majority of whose inhabitants attendance at the Opera
on the previous evening is indispensable, is preposterously inconsiderate,
not to say, inhuman.
I am, Sir, &c.
A FAshionABLE FATHER of a FAMILY.
Misfortunes never corne alone.
We see the KING of HANover is announced, as well as the EMI ERon or
Russia, to visit England in the month of May. Perhaps it is all for the
best that these two monarchs should make their visits at the same time, as
instances have been known of one violent poison counteracting another.

SHOP-LIFTING-FEMALE WEAKNESS.
PEccADILloes have a fashion the same as pelisses; and at
present, and indeed for some time past, they run very hard upon
shop-lifting. Jumping from the Monument at one time promised to
be very fashionable, but somehow it soon went out. At present,
females “of lady-like exterior,” with money in their pockets, and all
things comfortable at home, have shown a strange disposition to
pilfer stockings, laces, scarfs, and fifty other things of the count-
less articles of wardrobe which the sin of Eve has brought—poor
souls 1 for they hate dress—upon her daughters. We have tried to
discover the philosophy of all this, but—we blush not to confess it—
we have failed. A lady delinquent—committed a few days since
from Worship Street to Newgate—has, however, explained away
the difficulty; for MRs. Watson, being charged with stealing a rich
satin scarf–the article ſell from some part of her dress—said, “I
suppose there's an unfortunate moment for every one, at times.”
The worst of it is, this moment having once come upon us, so fre-
quently returns. First, there is the moment of weakness, the shop-
lifting moment: then the moment of discomfort, or committal to
Newgate moment: and, finally, the moment of sentence, or trans-
porting moment. However, at the present time, there is evidently
a shop-lifting mania among “respectable” people. Can nothing be
done to make the folly vulgar ! We wish that for a high moral good,
Lond BRough AM would consent to steal a satin-stock. He has only
to try his mand at shoplifting to bring the practice into immediate
disrepute.
TELL INTELLIGIBLY TOLD.
-
The curtain ascends on the fairest of sights,
The Lake of the Cantons, with Seeilsberg's heights:
The village of Brunnen delightfully sits
Below ; overlooked by the mountains of Schwytz.
Some huntsmen now enter as if from the chase,
One carries a thing in a brown canvas case,
Which is stuffed with old pieces of rubbish or rag,
And painted outside to resemble a stag.
The game they have caught they're supposed to be bringing,
They stand in a row, and, of course, begin singing ;
But first, four or five of them thrust to their throttles
º if they were drinking) some property bottles,
n order to give an excuse for the line,
Which ranks 'mid the joys of the chase, “rosy wine.”
And now in the distance is chiming a bell :
Says a hunter, “What's that "though he knows very well
'Tis one of the chorus who stands at the wing,
To strike on the bell as the others all sing.
The call-boy and prompter had tried it in vain,
At morning rehearsal again and again ;
But not being able to furnish the chime
With a proper regard to the musical time,
MR, SHARP, of the chorus, with manners polite,
Had kindly consented to do it at night.
A chorus of shepherds is heard from without,
But no one can catch what on earth 'tis about ;
Though we somehow get hold of a line at the close,
Which states that the shepherds have sunk to repose.
The hunters go out when they've finished their bawling,
For they say that the horn of their chieftain is calling.
Matilda advances, 'mid plaudits most hearty,+
She's been at the hunt, and has slipp'd from the party.
The lady, in tones of most exquisite feeling,
Remarks that her senses are certainly reeling.
In fact—she confesses—that ARNold alone
She greatly prefers to the pomp of a throne,
She calls him a star—and she's certainly right;
A star that don't shine under eighty per night:
And when we say eighty we speak within bounds,
Twelve nights he performs for a thousand good pounds.
If each of the stars such a salary gain'd,
The cost of the skies could be never maintain'd,
No rate in the world were enough for requiting
The dreadful expense of Caerulean lighting.
Matilda's a princess, and ARNold's a nobody,
Who in urging his suit is by no means a slow body,
Their mutual fate in a couple of verses
They subject to sundry melodious curses.
At length 'tis agreed he shall seek after fame,
In order to get an illustrious name ;
And with victory's laurel adorning his head,
'Tis thought he'll be fit for the princess to wed.
But they never appear to consider a bit
The probable chance of that head being split.
As Tell is approaching, together with WALTER,
MATILDA makes oath that she never will alter;
And having arranged that she'll meet him next day,
Miss RomeR with tenderness parts from DuPREz.
Now ARNold is joined both by WALTER and Tell,
They join in the trio that's known very well,
The object of which, is a brief affidavit
That the three will all stick to their country and save it.
But near to the close of this splendid morceau
Poor ARNold is told, that his father's death-blow
Has by an assassin been recently given ;
The son into dreadful excitement is driven.
Durrez by his genius leads us away
Till we think that he's worth every pound of his pay;
And none in the boxes, the pit, or the gallery
* Would, during that trio, find fault with his salary.
And now the finale commences—a shout
Proclaims the approach of the Cantons without.
The Cantons of Unterwald, Uri, and Schwytz
Are seized with the most patriotic of fits.
They enter'd in separate lots, but they swear
Together they'll die, they will do, they will dare.
Tell offers to lead them—but ARNold would rather,
Being terribly roused by the death of his father.
Their hands and their hearts they continue uniting,
Determined on nothing but regular fighting:
Tell, WALTER and ARNold, and chorus and all,
Declare themselves ready to conquer or fall.
But though about falling so much has been heard,
There's none that's prepared to act up to the word;
Unless, as redeeming the pledge, may be reckon'd
The fall of the curtain, to finish
Act Second.

Sir JAMEs GRAham, not being sufficiently occupied in the Home

A SCENE AT COURT,
LoRD BRough AM is remarkable for an engaging familiarity. The
Queen is with him, “Little Vic.;” Paince Arlbert, “Prinny;” the
Anchbishop of CANTERBURY, “Old Cock;” SIR Robent PEEL,
“Bobby;” and the LAD1Es, “Molly,”“Sally,” “Betty,” &c. As for the
rules of society, the learned lord cares not a fig for them; and so
completely free and easy is he, that to him the highest American com-
pliment would be justly applied, that “he has not a bit of the gentleman
about him.”
At the last Drawing Room he made himself delightfully at home.
Every body knows that people at Court are like ghosts, who have not
the privilege of speaking till they are spoken to ; but Lond Brough AM,
who will speak on all opportunities, in or out of season, had no notion
of being governed by any such rule, and, going up to HER MAJEsty,
asked her, in the most free-and-easy off-hand way, whether she had any
commands for Paris, or any letters that he could take charge of.
The connecting link.
HER MAJEsty—opening her eyes to the fullest stretch instead of her
mouth—kept silence; looking the image of frozen amazement.
Lord BRough AM then turned to PRINCE ALBERT, and made him the
same obliging offer.
The PRINCE stiffened to such a degree, that how he contrived to make
a motion like a bow was quite wonderful. But, as he bent, he seemed
only to stiffen the more.
Lond BRougha M, nothing abashed, turned again to the QUEEN, with
the air of an irresistible proposal, and said, “I will take any parcels.”
What is there in the world that he will not take There is nothing
to which he will not turn his hand. And if we may infer what his carry-
ing would be from his known knack of fetching, he would (as the French
say) go far, indeed.
During the absence of PRInce ALBERT, a carrier pigeon, to convey
conjugal tidings, might be acceptable to HER MAJEsty ; but an old
carrion crow would make rather a sorry “Love's messenger.” But as
economy is the order of the day at the Palace, and as Lond Brough AM
volunteers to run of all errands gratis, we must not be surprised to see
him announced, by special appointment, Windsor Carrier in Ordinary
(fetching included) to IIER MAJEsty the Queen, and Paince

THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSTITUTE.
His Institution goes on admirably: quite
as well as its very spirited proprietor,
MR. SILK BuckINGHAM, could wish.
The soirées are well attended, and they
have this advantage, the presence of
MR. SILK BuckINGHAM, who reads his
code of politeness to those ladies and
gentlemen whose education he may think
neglected. Great improvements have
taken place at the Institution within this fortnight, members
being now enabled to obtain mutton chops at only the Athenaeum
price. The rooms are laid out with a most correct view to the
convenience of Mn. Silk Buckingham. As, however, we intend
to give a plan of the interior of the building, we postpone further
description.
A few nights since MR Silk BuckINGHAM gave a lecture on
“THE ART of BUILDING Youn NEst.” It was much admired.
The lecturer entered very minutely into the details of nest-build-
ing, as performed by various birds. After dwelling on the un-
erring instinct which operates in all the varieties of the feathered
race, the ingenious and talented lecturer deelared that he must
nevertheless give the highest praise to the cuckoo; for that saga-
cious creature suffered other birds to carry wool, hay, straw,
sticks, &c., for the construction of the nest, and, when the thing
was completed, took possession of it. M.R. SILK BuckINGHAM
then suggested that the like wisdom might dignify man ; that the
human animal might plump himself into a very comfortable nest,
having had lords and gentry to build and line it for him. (Applause
and laughter, amidst trlich the lecturer concluded.)
MR. S. Bucking HAM has, at last, found the reward of merit
in the proprietorship of the British and Foreign Institute, con-
tributed to by the gentle and simple (especially the latter) of the
land. It has been held impossible to make silk purses out of
sows’ ears, but MR. SILK BuckINGHAM has certainly conquered
that difficulty.
We stop the press to announce that HER MAJEsty has been
pleased to grant to Mr. B. the crest of a cuckoo proper, with claws
displayed, in a lozenge ; motto—

No wife had we, nor squalling brats, nor anything so low,

GREAT as have been the exertions of our missionaries in promoting the
cause of civilisation ; numerous and sanguinary as have been the achieve-
ments of our warriors, directed solely to that philanthropic end, they have
all signally failed. Savages are savages, Hottentots Hottentots still. We
have tried to reform the world by force; it would not do. It is to per-
suasion alone that the brute nature is amenable. The herbaceous boon
and the bland recommendation to advance, are more operative on the
asinine quadruped than the stern imprecation and the oaken cudgel.
Persuasion is peculiarly the weapon of the gentler sex.
attribute of woman. To woman, therefore, must be confided the task of
humanising Man; and it is with unfeigned pleasure that we hear that a
female mission is about to be founded for the Propagation of Politeness
in Foreign Parts.
Its arrangements have not, as yet, been completed; but many young
ladies of the world of Fashion, we understand, have already offered their
services; and are ready at the shortest notice to leave home and country,
Opera and Assembly, to diffuse the blesings of refinement overdistant shores.
Our principal English vocalists have also offered to come forward; and
in their offer several foreign artistes, including the most eminent danseuses,
have joined. Among others, Persiani, we believe, is destined for New
Zealand, and Carlotta Grisi for Timbuctoo.
We hope it will succeed. Sceptics may sneer; and the faithless in
humanity anticipate failure; but that female assiduities, rightly directed,
will felicitously effect the desired object, we do not doubt. The black is
as capable of polish as the boot; nor is woman inferior to Day and
Martin.
Will the Chinese, asks the scoffer, amputate his pigtail; will he eschew
opium at the behest of beauty Analogy answers, “No doubt of it.”
Behold the youthful poet—the rising artist. One day he walks, fancy
free, down Regent Street; his locks straggling over his shoulders or
fluttering in the gale. The very next, the request of Affection despatches
him to the establishment of Truefit, and the locks of Eccentricity are
sacrificed at the shrine of Loveliness. Mustachios, beard, imperial, are
resigned without a sigh ; and the censorship of womanhood reduces the
exuberance of whisker. The mild Havannah, at the yet milder remon-
strance of female lips, is cast away; and the snuff-box, without a murmur,
is emptied into the fire. Do we not, under the same gentle influence, see
the once knotted neckcloth assume the graceful bow; the coat, formerly
innocent of the clothes-brush, become spotless and speckless; the cheap
exchanged for the western tailor; and the four-and-nine-penny gossamer
for the velvet nap : Do we not find Circassian cream, Naples soap,
Kalydor, and Eau de Cologne, added to the once simple toilet? Do not
awkwardness and rusticity rush to Nathan, and with privacy and expedition
learn to dance.
Surely the power thus effectual on the domestic Goth will act yet more
resistlessly on the foreign barbarian. And what glorious results may we
not anticipate from it ! The anthropophagous Carib will be converted to
mutton; the train oil of the Laplander will be superseded by blanc-mange.
The Ojibbeway Indian, renouncing the scarecrow, will exchange feathers
and paint for kerseymere and super Saxony, and relinquish his hideous
war-dance for the graceful quadrille. The piano will resound in the
Kraal of the Caffre; the Negro lip will attune the flute. The world, in
short, will be one vast drawing-room; its citizens one large tea-party.
We trust that the proposed mission will receive that full measure of
support to which its prospective usefulness entitles it ; and that the public
To coax is the
|
| English person, “une petite demoiselle si necessaire,
purse-strings will be liberally drawn in furtherance of its benevolent views.
To appeal to any but the loftiest motives to induce the daughters of
England to enlist themselves under its banners, were an unworthy task;
still there is one recommendation which we would venture to suggest to its
projectors. Let no expense be spared in providing every missionary with
the most tasteful and elegant dresses, as well to augment as much as
possible the force of their gentle precepts, as to recompense the fair
enthusiasts for their labours in the work of love. Of any funds that may
be raised for the purpose, Punch will be most willing to undertake the
management.
GEMS FROM JENKINS.
OUR dear friend has begun lately a very artful way of conciliating the
aristocracy of the country: viz., by criting bad French in his Journal.
Witness the two following paragraphs extracted from Tuesday's Journal,
and profound specimens of JENKINsian dissimulation:-
“Un jeune homme, age de 30 ans, parlant Francais, Allemande et Anglais, quc a
servie de famille destingue deseire se placer comme Valet d'chambre, ou Courier, que
peura donne de bonaclemmation.”
“Unc personne Francaise, . . . . elle sais faire lesrobes, et bien coiffee; elle
n’a point d'objection deprendre le soin d'une petite Demoiselle si necessaire, point
d’objection pour la campagne ni Londre, mais une Famille pour voyager sera preferable.”
They are copied from our fashionable contemporary with laborious
accuracy, and contain specimens of a noble eccentricity of style, which
we never believed to have existed in any person below the rank of the
MARQUIs of LoNDoNDERRY. Even he could not write worse French than
the Courier of the Post. And little boys of six years old will remark
with pleasure that out of the last twenty-two words in the paragraph,
only four are right. Was it the Morning Post who wrote, or was it the
Courier * Only the fashionable contemporary knows this awful secret.
The Femme de Chambre announcement is evidently the writing of an
” a little girl so
necessary, and “une famille pour voyager sera preferable,” “a family to
travel will be preferable,” are, we fearlessly assert, the expressions of
BETTY the housemaid, not of MANON the Femme de Chambre. Or is
there a presiding genius at the office of the Post, who himself composes
these remarkable advertisements 1 and who writes about “que a servie,”
and “de bon aclemmation,” and “elle sais faire,” and “elle sais coiffee ?”
We are inclined to think that Jenkins writes bad French, not because
he knows no better, but because in the fashionable world good French
would not be understood. They don’t like it there. They like their
French loaded and doctored like their wine ; and J.-knowing his public
will only consume a bad article,_supplies that bad article to their hearts'
content. If LADY Londonder Ry, if LADY BlessingtoN, if LADY BULwer,
if MRs. TRollope, if the fashionable world in a word proves its dislike of
good French by constantly practising bad, why should a journalist venture
to differ from such authorities, or pretend to better behaviour than his
betters?
HEARTLESS SPOLIATION.
PERHAPs the whole history of burglary—and we appeal to MR. Ains-
worth to corroborate the speculation—never displayed a more cruel and
heartless robbery than that—according to the Morning Post—lately
committed in the house of the Reverend John CAMPBELL, Selkirk House,
in the county of Selkirk. That house was entered on the 21st ult., and
the reverend gentleman despoiled, among other precious things, of “a
silver chased toddy jug 1" Milton asks—
- —— who would rob a hermit of his beads,
His maple dish?”
Possibly, not even Selkirk thieves. We therefore recommend to the
Rev. John Campbell henceforth to drink his toddy out of a wooden
vessel, maple or other ; for what, asks, FatheR. Mathew, “ has any
churchman to do with toddy jugs of chased silver ?”

ARMORIAL BEARINGS.
MANY persons have been surcharged by the tax-gatherers for
using what the said fiscal collectors denominate, according to the
Act, an “armorial bearing or ensign,” which the offenders, on the
other hand, declare to be a fancy emblem or device. The parties
surcharged have appealed to the commissioners, who have decided
in their favour; the judges, however, have reversed—and in the
cases we shall show—we think very properly, all such decisions.
We notice a few of the offenders, omitting their names:—
An attorney, for using on a letter threatening a writ, a seal with
the words and device, “Je rous suis partout” (“I follow you every-
where”), with a Sun and Sunflower.
A fashionable tailor, for using a seal to his debtor with the words,
“Though lost to sight, to memory dear.” -
A gentleman in easy circumstances, for refusing his friend the loan
of five pounds, and sealing his letter with a ship tossed by waves,
with the motto, “Such is life.”
Another gentleman, on writing to a friend in Chancery, and using
the motto, “Necer despair.”
A sheriff's officer to a light comedian, asking the favour of a private
box, and using for his device a pair of open scissors, with the motto,
“We only part to meet again.”
A bookseller, for writing to a certain
Cupid with a Heart, with motto, “Stop thief!” (Grossly personal.)
We put it to the reader whether the above offenders deserve any
sympathy for any surcharge that may be made upon them, after
having used devices and mottoes for the obvious purpose of wounding
the feelings of their fellow-creatures

“The smoke nuisance” is taken up in earnest in the House of Com-
mons. All people are to be compelled to consume their own smoke, and
the smoker of a cigar, pipe, or any other instrument of fumigation, who
suffers a puff to escape him, is to be subjected to heavy penalties. An
ingenious apparatus for sweeping people's throats, has been invented, and
may be seen at the Polytechnic. It is less cumbrous than the machine
for chimnies, and can be worked by a man and a boy.
Ex UNO DISCE OMNES.
We see a Parliamentary Report has just been published “ON SMoke.”
As this title is so very ambiguous, could any of our contemporaries
inform us which measure of the Session is the subject of the report We
will do as much for them in a similar embarrassment.
3Legal Intelligente.
We understand that the crier of the Rolls Court is about to be pro-
moted to the post of link-boy at the Opera, where his awful shouting, which
he introduces so injudiciously in the midst of the judgments of Lord
LANGDALE, will be highly effective for the purpose of calling up the car-
riages. The worthy crier is likewise expected to be very expert in open-
ing and shutting the doors, or putting up the blinds, which are all of
them operations in which he frequently indulges while the Master of the
Rolls is occupied in delivering his decisions. In a recent case of Snooks
v. Timkins, the crier's effective accompaniment of shouts for silence,
slamming of doors, and drawing up of blinds, completely drowned the voice
literary lord, and using A
ºf Lord LANGDALE, who was thus prevented from causing annoyance to
either party, for nobody could tell on which side the decision was given.
In thus aiding the glorious uncertainty of the law, the crier of the Rolls
has proved himself a worthy member of the profession he has the honour
of belonging to.
TOM THUMB AT THE PALACE.
T appears that the dwarf GENERAL ToM THUMB
and his showman—“guardian,” lisps the Court
Circular—have been to Buckingham Palace, com-
manded thither by Her Majesty the QUEEN,
whose admiration of genius, native or foreign,
has passed into a proverb. We trust that the
visit will lead to no rupture between England and
France. We, however, put it to M. Thiers and
his party, whether they ought not to call upon M.
Guizot to demand an explanation of the Court
of St. James's ; for it is written in the Circular,
published, be it remembered, by royal authority,
º that “the General exhibited his clerer imitations
- ſº of Napoleon, &c., which elicited the approbation of
º Her Majesty and the royal circle.”
Punch is no lover of war; nevertheless, there
are circumstances that, unless national honour be no more than the
smoke of blank cartridge, demand wholesome blood-letting. We put
it to the calm and comprehensive THIERs whether this representation
of NApoleon by ToM THUMB be not a casus belli 2 Whether France
ought not to see in it a studied insult to her national sympathies, bound
up as they are with the memory of her Emperor GENERAL Toxt
THUMB weighs fifteen pounds, and is in height twenty-five inches. And
he performs NApoleon I He, with the Majesty of England smiling on
the creature, walks, and folds his arms, and takes snuff, like Bona-
PARTE I What is meant by this heartless parody—what can be
intended if not a sarcasm at the greatness of France; a malicious
attempt to satirize and dwarf her vastness Was there nobody left
to sneer at, and practically lampoon, save the Emperor of France 1
If the dwarf must imitate somebody for the amusement of English
royalty, could he not—that is if he be really little enough—could he
not imitate Lond BRough AM t
ToM THUMB at the palace, despite ourselves, will suggest curious
thoughts. ToM THUMB—CHARLEs STRATTAN is the little crea-
ture's real name—ceased growing when he was five months old.
“Since that time,” says his pamphlet biography, he “increased in
vigour and the manliness of his proportions, but did not increase one
inch in height, or one ounce in weight.” Now, had it pleased nature,
when playing this freak upon a human animal, to have chosen for its
subject a PRINCE of WALEs, a George IV. for instance, stopping
his growth when only five months old, how would the practical joke
have puzzled the jurisconsults We put it to BRough AM, whether
the succesion would have been set aside in favour of full-grown York?
If not, how much should we have saved had
GeoRae iv., like Tom THUME,
only weighed fifteen pounds, and stopped at twenty-five inches!
How much would have been saved merely in tailors' bills, and how
many toy Pavilions for his dwarf majesty might have been built at a
hundredth part of the cost that was swallowed by the royal folly at
| Brighton I After all, dwarfs might bring their advantages.

THE PICCADILLY STANDING ARMY.
Requently we have called attention to
the very formidable weapon carried by
the beadle of the Burlington Arcade, and
now we are compelled to direct the notice
of the public to the very irritating man-
ner in which the murderous instrument
is carried by the functionary alluded to.
Happily for the peace of the Arcade, the
boys seldom pass through the place we
have named, and thus collision is pre-
vented. We are aware that the beadle
has a most trying position to maintain,
a most difficult part to play, and a most
formidable instrument of bloodshed—or
black-eye-shed at the very least — to
carry under the very nose of a goaded
boyocracy, who only want the word to
burst out into open repudiation of the
beadleian authority. We should suggest
to the managers of the Arcade the
expediency of substituting the effective
halfpenny switch for the expensive and truly murderous instrument
that is at present the symbol of official employment. We have had
opportunities of consulting some of the boys, and their feeling seems
to be the very natural one of hatred, not unmixed with alarm, when
they see a beadle armed not only to the teeth, but to the very eyebrows—
we allude to the gold band on his hat—with offensive hints as to his own
supremacy. Something must be done, and the sooner the better; for
the beadle is at present “miserable to himself and useless to º
Knowing the unpopularity of a standing army, we would say to the Bur-

I HAve perused with igsthrame astanishment the exthra-

That argumint you may remimber, is, “that the profit of the mill-

these two hours, their ruin would infallibly inshue.”

PUNCH*S MIRROR OF PARLIAMENT.
N Thursday last Lord BRough AM rose for the pur-
pose of correcting a misrepresentation, or rather,
a misunderstanding, relative to himself, and in-
deed he was always being misunderstood, for
nobody seemed able to understand him. He
(Lord BRough AM) had received a number of
abusive letters, but these he did not mind. In
fact, he rather liked them, for he was used to
them, and use being second nature it was natural
he should like to receive them. Some of these
letters asked him why he did not give up what he received out of the
THE life of PREsident Ty LER, we learn from the American
papers, has been saved by a black man. The President was
returning from the Congress Burial-ground, Washington, where he
had attended the interment of the victims killed on board the
Princeton, when his horses took fright, and would have precipitated
him down a steep, but that they were arrested by the hand of a negro.
We know not whether, according to American notions, we can
courteously congratulate the President on his escape, seeing that
it makes him a debtor for his life to a black—a mere human chattel
—a thing of sale and barter. The accident brought the first magis-
trate of the first republic into such close dependence on the compas-
sion and sympathy of probably a black slave, that we know not how
he can well cleanse himself of the humiliating annoyance. Heroes
of the olden day have gladly preferred death rather than owe their
lives to acts or persons mean or infamous; and animated by the like
ennobling spirit, we must believe that PREsi DENT TYLER would have
earned for himself a higher reputation with his countrymen, had
he loudly and sternly rejected the succour of the black, and
suffered himself to be whirled down the mortal precipice
before him. He would, then, like Curtius taking the leap,
have vindicated the nobility of his soul for the honour and
glory of his country. He would, by his last mighty act, have proved
to the sneering world that Americans sell black men like beasts
really for the reasons that Americans give; that the negro is a crea-
ture only a little above the ape, a piece of mechanism of human
seeming, but in no manner touched by the same sympathies, solem-
nized by the same affections, as the white man I Thus considered, it
would have been a sublime spectacle to behold PREsi DENT TYLER
prepared for death, and loudly forbidding the approach of the negro,
as a creature with whom he had nothing in common—an outcast of
God and man, whose compassionate help brought odium on the
assisted. Thus dying, the President would have asserted a great
principle, and left a memory sweet and balmy to man-selling
Americans. As it is, the life of PREsin ENT TYLER is damnified,
soiled, blotted ; for he holds it only from the compassion of a black,
who is most probably a slave.
However, President Ty LER, in the overflow of his gratitude,
may wish to reward his deliverer. May we suggest the mode : A
white man is to be hanged in Louisiana for aiding and abetting the
escape of a black woman; let the negro who has saved the white
PREsident have a place at his execution, that he may see the punish-
taxes paid by the poor, when he did nothing for the money. Now
he (Lond Bāough AM) did work very hard--and, in fact, so far from
wishing to do nothing, he had worked hard to try and get into some
place where he might be in a condition to serve the public. (Hear.) He
was quite willing to resign the pension of which he is in the receipt, if
he might be allowed to go back to the bar, for when at the bar he (Lond
BRough AM) was in the habit of making a good, he might say a decided
good thing of it. As to work, he worked harder than any factory girl,
and indeed he (Lord BRough AM) wished he was a factory girl. (Hear.)
Yes, he (Lord BRough AM) would gladly change places with the factory
irls, for in fact, he now did quite as much as they do. . Why, his friend,
#. CAMPBell, did as much, for he was often occupied in spinning yarns
even until a very late hour in the evening. (Hear.) He hoped that the
House would understand him, and if that was the case, he did n’t care for
all the anonymous, abusive, vituperative, and insulting letters in the
universe.
Lond CAMpbell quite agreed with the learned lord (BRough AM) as to
the hard work of the latter. He had watched the noble lord trying to
work himself on to the woolsack; but that seemed to be harder work
than he (Lord BRough AM) could accomplish.
LoRD BRough AM. That is not my hardest work. Listening to your
speeches is harder than that.
Lord Campbell. My learned friend's interruptions are very hard on
me. He says that he would be glad to go back to the bar; and perhaps
his love of pleading has induced him to volunteer his services as counsel
for the Government.
LoRD BRough AM. My learned friend, I believe, is opposed to the Govern-
ment. Let him volunteer his services to the Government as counsel, and
he will evince his hostility in the strongest possible manner.
LoRD CAMPBell thought this observation uncalled-for.
LoRD BRough AM. Why, of course ! It's not likely you would call for
that which is condemnatory of yourself; and if you did call for it, I
don't see why I should respond to your call.
LoRD CAMPBELL rose to order.
The Duke of WELLINGton thought this altercation could do no good.
LoRD BRougham concurred. He was afraid his learned friend Lond
CAMPBELL) was past mending. (A laugh.)
Here the subject dropped.

Tribute to Messrs. Brotherton and Williams-

IN consequence of the exertions of these gentlemen to get the
House of Commons to-bed at a reasonable hour, it is in contemplation
among some of the ladies of the members to get up a subscription
for a monster nightcap.
A preliminary meeting has already been held, at which the follow-
ing resolutions were unanimously carried :—
That Mess Rs. BRoth ERton and Williams have proved them-
selves the true and zealous promoters of public repose, not only by
their exertions to get the house to-bed, but also sending the members
to sleep by the speeches they have made in Parliament.
That while the extinguisher is the only remedy for the revolu-
tionary flame, the nightcap is the sole safeguard against the fatal fire
of domestic discord.
That MEssRs. BRoth ERtoN and WILLIAMs have proved, that, amid
the flowers of Parliamentary eloquence, none is more potent than the
poppy; and that while posterity will crown their temples with a
garland of poppies, the present age will gratefully encase their brows
in a white cotton nightcap. That the only light which ought to
decorate the domestic altar is the rushlight, inasmuch as it is the
only one that remains, as the poet beautifully expresses it—“true
to the shade.”
That Messas. BRoth Eaton and WILLIAMs be requested to attend
the next meeting, when, whichever of them the cap fits, will be
requested to wear it.
After these resolutions had been carried, one of the ladies present
made a very powerful address, in which she described the snuffers
as a most capital instrument either for good or for evil, and apos-
trophised the flat candlestick as the domestic demon, standing in
sullen silence on the side-board, wakening memories of blighted
expectations, and pointing, as it were, with its blackened wick to
that chamber which should be the chamber of repose.
After a few more observations of a similar nature, the meeting
was dissolved.
PRINCE ALBERT’S TOUR.
(FRom oua own aeroRTER.)
PRINCE ALBERT's trip en garçon has hitherto been everything that
His Royal Highness and the nation could desire. His Royal High-
ness, it is remarked, has been in the very highest spirits, and declared
he did not even feel the motion of the vessel in crossing to Ostend ;
but he remained on deck the whole time, conversing gaily with every
one on deck, inquiring as to the use of the various ropes, and once or
twice personally boxing the compass. On reaching Cologne, he sent
a ginger-beer bottle down to the banks of the river, to be filled with
the veritable Eau, which he intends bringing home as a present to
Her Majesty.
Our own reporter is in attendance. He has taken such precautions
as will prevent him from being ejected in the unceremonious manner
that marked his recent expulsion from the princely presence.
THE REPORTER AND THE PRINCE.
A GREAT deal has been said about the Reporter who forced his way into
the Royal barge, but nothing has transpired as to the report which that
indefatigable penny-a-liner (he was Punch's own) drew up on board the
craft that was laden with Royalty. The unhappy scribe had crawled
down the companion-ladder in the disguise of a man bringing ginger beer
to the steward, and having sneaked under the stunsail, he lashed himself
to the main-brace of the gib, where he continued till the vessel got under
weigh ; taking notes actively during the whole time with a bit of chalk,
and jotting down his ideas on the bottom of the jolly-boat. It was only
a lurch of the vessel that rolled him out from the situation into which he
had got, and sent him floundering along the deck till he reached the feet
of PRINCE ALBERT. The treatment of the Reporter is not here the sub-
ject of remark—his notes being all that we have to deal with on the present
occasion.
The report in its original state was very elaborate, but there are only
two things in the whole of it that we consider worth extracting. They
are both of them jokes by His Royal Highness PRINCE ALBERT. On
Mr. Anson suggesting that he trusted they should have no humbug on
landing from the Mayor of Cowes, the Prince wittily observed that it was
impossible there could be a Mare of Cowes, for the term mare was only
applicable to horses. -
A second, and perhaps a richer piece of facetia, was occasioned by the
fact of a charity boy standing on the pier when the Prince landed. His
Royal Highness remarked that though the place was called Cowes, to
judge by the legs of the charity boys there must be a frightful deficiency
of calves. These jokes will perhaps hardly be thought worth the carriage
from the Isle of Wight, but as the reporter was ducked and pitched into
the mud, it would have been hard indeed if a portion of his intelligence
could not have been made available.
LAMENTABLE IGNORANCE OF MINISTERS.
The reader may often have been struck by instances of extraordinary
ignorance on the part of Ministers generally, and of certain noble Lords, in
matters of the Press. From some strange fatality, or from their own wicked
wilfulness, they have often no knowledge of so dim and obscure a journal
as the Times. A night or two since, SIR James GRAHAM picked a Jack
Cade out of “a periodical.” He, of course, had never heard of that small,
insignificant, and feeble print, the Examiner. Hence, fearing that he
might be interrogated upon the whereabout and character of that journal, he
wisely merged it in the general term, “periodical.” Again and again LoRD
BRough AM declares that he never reads the newspapers, and upon
such declaration looks loftily around him, as though “justly proud of his
ignorance.” We understand that it is the intention º a very high per-
sonage to appoint a Commission to inquire into this state of mental
darkness of Ministers and others, and we shall therefore in due season
give a full report of the examination. In the mean time, as it may help
those about to be questioned, we out of our kindness state that the Times
is a daily newspaper, price fivepence; and that the Eraminer (hear it
not, SIR ANDREw AGNew) is published for Sundays. (N.B. There is a
country edition for Saturday's post.)
Boon to the Hot-headed.
The Police, as our readers are aware, are to be provided with a new
kind of hat, which is to be perforated for the admission of air. Wigs on
a siniilar principle are to be made for Lords CAMPBELL and BRough AM,
which, it is hoped, will have the effect of keeping their Lordships' heads
cool.
LoRD ABINGER, also, is to wear a wig of this kind whenever he presides
in a court of Justice.

The
HISTORY OF THE NEXT FRENCH REVOLUTION.
[From a forthcoming History of Europe.]
CHAP. VIII.-THE BATTLE OF THE FORTS.
On the morning of the 26th October, 1884, as his Majesty Louis
Philippe was at breakfast, reading the Débats newspaper, and wishing
that what the journal said about “Cholera Morbus in the Camp of
the Pretender Henri,”—“Chicken-pox raging in the Forts of the
Traitor Bonaparte,”—might be true, what was his surprise to hear
the report of a gun; and at the same instant—whizz I came an
eighty-four pound ball through the window, and took off the head of
the faithful Monsieur de Montalivet, who was coming in with a plate
of muffins. -
“Three francs for the window,” said the monarch ; “and the
muffins of course spoiled !” and he sate down to breakfast very
peevishly. Ah, King Louis Philippe, that shot cost thee more than a
window-pane—more than a plate of muffins—it cost thee a fair king-
dom and fifty millions of tax-payers.
The shot had been fired from Fort Pot Ato. “Gracious Heavens !”
said the commander of the place to the Irish prince, in a fury, “What
has your Highness done ** “Faix,” replied the other, “Donegal
and I saw a sparrow on the Tuileries, and we thought we’d have
a shot at it, that's all.” “Hurroo ! look out for squalls,” here cried
the intrepid Hibernian, for at this moment one of Paixhans's shells
fell into the counterscarp of the demilune on which they were
standing, and sent a ravelin and a couple of embrasures flying about
their ears. -
Fort Twenty-three, which held out for Louis Philippe, seeing Fort
Twenty-four, or Potato, open a fire on the Tuileries, instantly replied
by its guns, with which it blazed away at the Bourbonite Fort. On
seeing this, Fort Twenty-two, occupied by the Imperialists, began
pummelling Twenty-three ; Twenty-one began at Twenty-two ; and
in a quarter of an hour the whole of this vast line of fortification
was in a blaze of flame, flashing, roaring, cannonading, rocketing,
bombing, in the most tremendous manner. The world has never,
perhaps, before or since, heard such an uproar. Fancy twenty-four
thousand guns thundering at each other. Fancy the sky red with
the fires of hundreds of thousands of blazing, brazen meteors; the
air thick with impenetrable smoke—the universe almost in a flame !
for the noise of the cannonading was heard on the peaks of the
Andes, and broke three windows in the English factory at Canton.
Boom, boom, boom for three days incessantly the gigantic, I may
say, Cyclopean battle went on ; boom, boom, boom, bong | The air
was thick with cannon-balls; they hurled, they jostled each other in
the heavens, and fell whizzing, whirling, crashing, back into the very
forts from which they came. Boom, boom, boom, bong, brrwrrwrrr!
On the second day, a band might have been seen (had the smoke
permitted it) assembling at the sally-port of Fort Potato, and have
been heard (if the tremendous clang of the cannonading had allowed
it) giving mysterious signs and countersigns. “Tom" was the word
whispered, “Steele” was the sibilated response—(it is astonishing
how, in the roar of elements, the human whisper hisses above all !)—it
was the Irish brigade assembling. “Now or never, boys,” said their
leaders, and sticking their doodeens into their mouths, they dropped
stealthily into the trenches, heedless of the broken glass and sword-
blades; rose from those trenches; formed in silent order; and
marched to Paris. They knew they could arrive there unobserved
—nobody, indeed, remarked their absence.
The frivolous Parisians were, in the meanwhile, amusing them-
------ - - - - ~~~-
selves at their theatres and cafés as usual; and a new piece, in which
Arnal performed, was the universal talk of the foyers; while a new
feuilleton, by Monsieur Eugène Sue, kept the attention of the reader
so fascinated to the journal, that they did not care in the least for
the racarme without the walls.
TOM THUMB AND THE QUEEN.
HER MAJEsty has again commanded “the performances of Toxt
THUMB, the Yankee Dwarf.” This, indeed, was to be expected. We
had only to reflect upon the countless acts of patronage towards
the arts and sciences—had only to remember a few of the numerous
personal condescensions of the QUEEN towards men of letters, artists,
and philosophers—to be assured that even ToM THUMB would be
welcomed with that graceful cordiality which has heretofore made
Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle the homes of poetry and
science. De minimis curat Regina 1 Continental monarchs stop short
in their royal favours at full-grown authors and artists; but the
enthusiasm of Her Majesty QUEEN Victon 1A, not content with
showering all sorts of favours and rewards upon the literary and
artistic spirits of her own country and age, lavishes with prodigal
hand most delicate honours upon an American ToM THUMB, whose
astounding genius it is to measure in his boots five-and-twenty inches 1
To this how small is Victor Hugo at the Tuileries : to this how
mean and petty Göt HE at the Court of Saxe-Weimar !
Let us, however, with due gravity, notice the second performance
of Tom THUMB at the Palace, as recorded in the Chronicle:–
“His personation of the EMPERon NApoleon elicited great mirth, and this was
followed by a representation of the Grecian Statues, after which the General danced a
nautical hornpipe, and sang several of his favourite songs.”
Let it be remembered that the QUEEN of the BELGIANs, the
daughter of Louis-PHILIPPE, was one of the merry-makers at this
parody of NApoleon, let M. THIERs and his party note well this
insulting circumstance, and, having noted it, let them make the
most of it.
Next comes QUEEN Victor 1A, to Englishmen the familiar cha-
racter of a rewarding spirit :—
“Her Majesty the Queen, at the conclusion of the entertainment, was pleased to pre-
sent to the General, with her own hand, a superb souvenir, of the most exquisite handi-
craft, manufactured of mother-of-pearl, and mounted with gold and precious stones. On
one side are the crown and royal initials “W. R.," and on the reverse bouquets of flowers
in enamel and rubies. . In addition to this splendid gift, her Majesty subsequently pre-
sented the General with a beautiful gold pencil-case, with the initials of Tom Thumb,
and his coat of arms engraved on the emerald surmounting the case, accompanying the
royal souvenir with the expression of her Majesty's high gratification at the persutile
talents of the General, and also a compliment to Mr. Barnum, his guardian (i.e., show-
man), on the aptness of his pupil. The General then made his congé, amidst the con-
gratulations of the royal party.”
ToM THUMB being—according to the biography published by his
showman, BARNux1–the son of a Yankee carpenter, we should much
like to know the General's arms. Did her MAJEsty, before the
“performance,” send to learn them, that they might be duly engraved;
or were they, as MATHEws's French Shoemaker made his little boot,
struck off in “a moment of enthusiasm f*
Her MAJESTY next praises the “versatile talents of the General.”
In this laudation we, as friends of Bhough AM, see nothing less than
a marked slight of his lordship. How often has BRough AM been to
the Palace—how versatile has he shewn himself when there——and
when, we ask it, was ever he praised by the QUEEN like Tom THusin
Let us advise his lordship, ere the next drawing-room takes place, to
learn to “personate NApoleon”—to “represent the Grecian Statues”
—to dance “a nautical hornpipe,” and sing several Yankee songs.
Touching the royal gifts presented by the QUEEN to Tom Thu Mb,
Mr. BARNUM, the showman, has, in the handsomest manner, offered
them, as additional objects of attraction, to a certain exhibition about
to be opened to the public. It is this. It having been suggested that
the many presents of jewellery, plate, books, pictures, and other rare
chattels, made by the QUEEN to the various men and women of genius
of her country, would, if brought together, amaze the most credulous
—such exhibition will take place at the very earliest opportunity.
The “mother-of-pearl” souvenir and “gold pencil-case,” presented
by the QUEEN to Tom THUMB, will, we can assure our readers, form
the most striking objects in the collection.
Brougham Again.
It appears, by a late debate on the supplies, that sums of money have
been paid to Lord BRough AM “for defending himself in his official
capacity against improper attacks.” Upon this principle of remuneration
for inflicted injury, we wish to ask if in future Lord BRough AM is to be
paid for his own speeches 1

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OLD NAUTICAL HAT.
ooking upon you, Punch, as one of the main props
of our moral welfare, and of our national
strongholds, I venture to address to you a few
lines on a subject that seems to me of para-
mount importance. I may be vulgar,
Mr. Punch—nay, I dare say I am
vulgar—but I am candid enough to
confess that I am one of those who
consider the nautical drama as one of
the strong pegs that hold together
our wooden walls, and thus keep
secure this happy country, where
misery is unknown, where the ope-
rator is always amply repaid, and
where slavish toil in factories for a
altry pittance is a thing unheard of.
= Weaken this peg, and you in some
degree weaken the wooden walls ;
weaken the wooden walls, and who
shall say what will become of our
national greatness? I assure you,
Punch, I see a very intimate connexion between Mr. T. P. Cooke and the
stability of my native land.
But to proceed to the matter to which I would more especially call your
attention. I miss, Sir, in the present day, a certain article of dress that,
in the years of my youth, used to make a great impression. I mean, Sir,
this sort of thing :—
The hat was brightly japanned ; or, as was popularly said, it was a
“shiny” hat, with a ship or the royal arms painted thereon in lively
colours. Its use in the melodrama was immense—nay, I do not exagge-
rate when I state that I have seen it sustain three nautical dramas of
intense interest by its own unassisted might. The British seaman, when
attacked by some ruffian with a black beard, large Dutch breeches, loose
cap, and wide boots, had only to cry out, “Look at this here picter on
my hat,” and his moral and physical superiority was at once proclaimed.
Who could deviate from the paths of virtue with such a hat, and such a
picture upon it ! The audience at once felt the force of the argument,
and invariably acknowledged its cogency by a good “three times three”
of clapping and stamping, heightened by an eloquent “Bray-vo.”
There was another use in the “shiny” hat. The flopping broad-
brimmed straw is a very good thing in its way, and does admirably for
the ordinary class of mariners, who sit round small tables, quaff large
draughts of nothing out of tin pots, having first poured the same out of
an empty tankard, and sing rattling choruses about “Sons of the wave.”
But º all the little extra elegances of nautical costume are allowed to
fade away, what is to become of the distinction between the pet sailor of
the lot and the rest of his messmates, who are his equals in point of naval
rank, but immeasurably his inferiors in all dramatic respect Now, the
“shiny” hat, with the picture, just completed the required superiority.
The other sailors had entire suits of blue, or blue with common white
trousers, but our hero lined his jacket with white, and had a stripe of
white on each side of the elegant blue trousers; the other sailors wore
shoes as pleased the gods, but our hero was invariably strong in the
buckles; the other sailors had common straws, but our hero exulted in the
hat I have been describing. Sir, if we allow the hat to be taken from us
without uttering a word, the white lining and the buckles may follow,
and then what is to become of our nautical drama :
SURRIENsis.
Proposed Monument to Captain Cook.
A circular has been industriously distributed, expressive of surprise,
amounting almost to consternation, at the fact, of there being no monu-
ment to Captain Cook. A zealous individual, a native of a colony Cook
discovered, has been trying to get up a monument, and the scheme is
really worthy of a gentleman green from Otaheite.
With reference to a monument, however, we should suggest that the
affair is rather gone by, and indeed we think there is an old melodrama
occasionally acted, in which Captain Cook is the principal character; so
that he is not altogether so badly off for a memorial, by which to be
handed down to posterity in general, and the frequenters of the Surrey
Theatre in particular. We are averse to monuments erected at the
public expense, and recommend, as a general principle, that heroes should
| find their own—a plan we propose to the adoption not only of the Cooks,
|= the Browns, the Smiths, the Joneses and the Tomkinses.
FALLACIES OF THE FACULTY.
Punch respectfully begs to call the attention of the Faculty to the fol-
lowing Fallacies, which he has observed to be rather prevalent among
them:—
Fallacy 1. That, having placed your name with M.R.C.S. after it on
your door, a variegated lamp in front of your fanlight, and blue bottles in
your window, you may marry and expect to get a living.
2. That a suit of black, and a white neckcloth, will cause you to be
mistaken for a man of character and skill.
3. That setting up a carriage before you can afford to keep one, will
persuade people that you are getting on, or will cause you to get on, in
any other direction than towards Portugal Street; or will be at all condu-
cive to practice, except to the practice of the Insolvent Court.
4. That calling trivial complaints by hard names will make patients
believe that they are seriously ill.
5. That having yourself continually called out of church will gain you
any other notoriety than that of a humbug.
WHAT SHALL I HAVE FOR BREAKFAST 2
A LAY OF THE LODGING HOUSE.
Taste and Invention, oh celestial pair,
Descend, and aid me in this hour of woe:
What shall I have for breakfast ! Pray declare,
Kind nymphs ; for may I perish if I know !
Expanding buds the forest trees adorn,
The pastures now again are robed in green;
Yet still my table, at the meal of morn,
Presents, I grieve to say, a wintry scene.
On mossy banks Spring's early Violets bloom ;
But Spring's young Radishes, ah where are they
The vernal Primrose bursts its earthy tomb;
Where are the vernal Onions : Flora, say.
Of Steaks I'm tired, and so I am of Chops:
Of Kidneys, Bacon, Tongue, in short, of Meat.
And vainly have I roam'd amid the shops,
In quest of something that was good to eat.
Thy Bloaters, Yarmouth, even thine, are dry,
Dry as statistics. Kipper'd Salmon, too,
Which yesterday I was induced to try,
Turn'd out, I found, to be a thorough “do.”
Must I put up, then, with the simple roll
Muffin, or bread and butter, with my tea t
Come, then, sole solace, Sausage of my soul—
The Poet finds he must fall back on thee!
Qanibersity Intelligentt.
Oxford.
The Under-graduates are gone, thank goodness. The click of billiard-
balls, clatter of hacks, and discordant sounds of cornets—indications of
the studious habits of these gentlemen—are heard no more. The debates
at the Union have ceased to convulse the country, and attention is at last
directed to St. Stephen's. The town is left to the Scouts and Corporation.
We understand that M. Jullien, who recently made his first appearance
here, has entered into an arrangement with the Professors of Poetry and
Music to compose a new set of quadrilles on themes exclusively Oxonian.
We have seen an outline of the set, which we at once communicate to our
readers:—
1. IL PENSERoso The Freshman.
2. L'Allegao - - - . Thorough Little-go.
3. PAston AL SYMphony - . Rustication.
4. SENTIMENTAL . - - . A Pluck.
5. GRAND CLIMAx - - . A Great-go Supper.
In the last figure, M. Jullien has introduced an effect that cannot fail
to startle and delight his audience. At the time the din is terrific, a
perfect storm rages, and M. Jullien is in strong convulsions, when on a
sudden all is calm. This expresses the uproarious mirth of a supper-
party suddenly quelled by the arrival of the Senior Tutor, whose remon-
strance will be represented by an animated solo on the Ophicleide.
Again the uproar breaks forth—a fearful climax is acquired, and Great
Tom, by the kind permission of the Dean of Christ Church, concludes the
figure by striking the hour of midnight. Surely M. Jullien should have
the honorary degree of D.M. conferred upon him.

POLE-CATS OF THE PRESS.
A Mr. WELLs has told a moving tale to the Lond MAYon of the
sorrows and hardships of BARNARD GREgony, prisoner in Newgate.
“He is compelled to associate with felons,” says Mr. WELls—
doubtless, a dreadful indignity to the late editor of the Satirist, whose
co-mates and fellow-labourers in the vineyard were men of the nicest
sense of honour; gentlemen “of the first house, the very first house.”
Moreover, the said GREgony “sleeps on an iron bedstead, with rope
mattress and rug covering,”—a shocking circumstance, when we
remember the beds of roses that the said GREGoRY was wont to
spread in the columns of his newspaper for certain sufferers. “Mr.
GREgoRY is only allowed the prison diet!” Considering the extreme
delicacy of his appetite, that for years fed upon lying and slandering,
—a most cruel punishment “Mr. GREGoRY's health is suffering,”
and therefore Mr. WELLs will “call a public meeting to address the
QUEEN" upon the matter. We know nothing of the state of Mr.
GREgony's health ; but this we know—men, on board the hulks,
who, it may be, have only wronged society to the amount of a few
shillings, fall ill, and find no sympathy in their sickness from the
Home-Office. How, then, is the late editor of the Satirist to claim
any indulgence, denied to the late abstractor (to use a soft word) of
pocket-handkerchiefs? Mr. SHERIFF Musgrove “regretted to
declare that Mr. Ghegory's health was declining.” Has the Sheriff
no sympathy for the declining health of many a wretched convict at
Woolwich Can he only find compassion for the convicted slanderer
that turned his venom to profit—has he no touch of tenderness for
the declining footpad, the wasting housebreaker? Let GREGoRY's ill-
health plead successfully for his pardon ; but let the same pardon be
awarded to sick culprits of every denomination.
AU GOURMET.
THE progress of the interesting Science of Geology has enabled Punch
to offer for public patronage the undermentioned antediluvian delicacies,
Viz. :-
Ichthyosaurus Jelly; a nutritious and palatable preparation, extracted
by an elaborate chemical processfrom the bones of the Ichthyosaurus, which
have been found to contain a large proportion of animal matter. In Pots,
at 2s. 6d. and 5s. each.
PATÉ DE MAstodonte. This fresh addition to the luxuries of the table
will be found, for richness and delicious flavour, altogether unrivalled. It
is peculiarly adapted for entremets, or for lunch. At 6d. each.
The Fossil Pot-Pourri, consisting of a judicious mélange of the most
récherché fossil remains, both vegetable and animal. It will keep for any
length of time, and in any climate. At 3s. per Pot.
MEGATHERIUM Soup. This unique soup is concocted from the nutritious
principles still existing in the osseous relics of that extinct gigantic animal
the Megatherium. Its extreme cheapness, and its qualities, in respect of
consistence and savour, will recommend it to the attention of the charitable.
Price only 24, per gallon. A liberal AllowANCE to Poor Law GuARDIANs
on taking a quantity. Sold only at Punch's Antediluvian Dépôt for the
sale of Fossil Provisions, 194, Strand.
Testimonial.—“Mr. Punch. Sin,--I have tasted your antediluvian deli-
cacies; namely, your Ichthyosaurus Jelly, your Pâté de Mastodonte, your Fossil
Pot-Pourri, and your Megatherium Soup. I am happy to state, that I can con-
scientiously pronounce them exquisite, and perfectly identical with the dishes of
the same name which I tasted ages ago I am, &c.,
“Widdicombe.”
3Bumth's Court Circular.
MR. Moon had an audience of Mrs. Hulse, the housekeeper at St.
James's Palace, for the purpose of being instructed in the various atti-
tudes into which it would be proper for him to throw himself on his pre-
sentation to HER MAJESTY.
Subsequently Mr. Sheriff Moon had the honour of going through a
series of the following six tableaux, or civic groupings, in the presence of
the sovereign and the precincts of the palace.
1. Sheriff Moon presenting his card to the hall porter.
2. Sheriff Moon going down on one knee before the Queen, after the
manner of the well-known statue of the slave fastening his sandal.
3. SHERiff Moon kissing the hand of Queen Victoria.
4. Sheriff Moon backing out.
5. SHERIFF Moon shaking hands with the housekeeper, and thanking
her for her lessons.
6. Sheriff Moon trying to force his way through the crowd, and defying
the policeman.
THE HOUSE I LIVE IN.
To THE EDITOR OF PUNCH.
SiR
y A certain gentleman, I see by the advertisements, has been
describing the house he lives in, for the edification of the public. If the
following description of the house I live in is likely to interest your readers,
you are welcome to it. I remain, &c.
A HouseholdeR.
The house I live in is in height five stories and a half, the latter forming
theattic or upper-story, which, I flatter
myself, is pretty well furnished ; but
which certain malicious acquaintances
will have to be a mere lumber-room.
|This tenement of mine is not, as you
| will have perceived, a large one ; in
fact, it is rather a cottage than a house:
but I have done what I could to ren-
der it a cottage ornée, and I rather
think with some success; however, of
that it is not for me to judge. My
cottage is thatched, and very comfort-
ably so—elegantly, too, in my opinion;
though some persons find fault with
the colour of the thatch, of which they
say, the tint is ultra straw, and too
nearly approximating to saffron.
The windows of my house are re-
markable for their peculiarly greenish
tint, which refreshing colour it pro-
bably is that enables me to see out of
them so well as I do. They enjoy
the singular privilege of exemption
from all tax. Their shutters are so
constructed, on a patent principle, as
to close spontaneously at a certain
hour.
The inside of my house is very
roomy and commodious ; as I will en-
gage to convince any gentleman who
may think fit to ask me to dinner.
My house has been built in a very
curious manner, upon props, whereby
it is capable of transposition at will.
The props have been constructed with
a view to strength, on the principle of
the arch.
You will hardly believe it, but my house took nearly twenty years in the
building before it was completed. It is composed, strange to say, of a
concrete extracted from vegetable and animal substances. For the first
twelvemonths from its commencement, this was derived solely from a
lactary fluid; an interval then ensued, during which a farinaceous and
saccharine compound afforded the requisite material. To enumerate
the different things which after that were from time to time incorpo-
rated with the fabric would be endless; suffice it to say, that, at present,
it is kept in repair by substances apparently inapplicable to architectural
purposes, as mutton chops, rumpsteaks, bread, cheese, and potatoes. These
matters are commingled with certain portions of the liquids termed
stout and ale, and with other products of vinous fermentation, occasionally
—shall I confess it including the alcoholic.
Altogether, I am very well satisfied with my house, which, though I
say it, that shouldn't, is a very eligible messuage for a single lady, pos-
sessed of competent means for maintaining the same in repair, which I
must own I find a somewhat difficult though pleasing task. I can offer
her a comfortable apartment in the left wing, with the privilege of making
such exterior alterations as she may deem advisable. Rent, a very con-
siderable object; as the property (at least in the opinion of the proprietor)
is valuable. No lady need apply who cannot command at least five
hundred a year. A youthful lodger would be preferred ; but age and
plainness no disqualifications, if accompanied by a sufficiency of capital.
N.B.-A Life Interest only will be disposed of. For particulars, apply
at Punch's Office.
the house I live in.
IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC.
The following paragraph has been published in the papers “on
authority;”—
"The Chancellor of the Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of two sovereigns, to be
applied ‘to the use of the nation.’”
If these two sovereigns are the King of PRussia and the Emperor
Nicholas, the best use to which the nation could apply them would be to
make one master of the Wandsworth workhouse, and the other his beadle.

THE BLOOMSBURY
CORDUROY AND LEATHER QUESTION.
Few days ago Bloomsbury was agitated
to her very centre by the dissemination of
a circular, of which the following is an
exact copy:—
School House,
Bloomsbury Churchyard.
SIR,-The trustees will meet as
above on Wednesday evening
next, at 7 o'clock precisely, to
- consider the following notice of
motion : “That corduroy trousers be substituted for the leather breeches
worn by the boys.”
Written by T. Abson, aged 14 years.
The consternation created throughout the beautiful little Bury of
Bloom (Bloomsbury), by this singular announcement, may be faintly
conceived, but cannot be even partially depicted. People might be
seen walking in every direction, some one way and some the other.
The tradesmen might be observed standing behind their counters,
silently serving their customers, or wrapt in contemplation of their
books at their desks in their back parlours. Cabs now and then
Passed through Bloomsbury-square, while here and there a private
carriage might be observed to wind its way through some of the
principal thoroughfares. In the face of every inhabitant we thought
we could trace the anxious question, “Is it to be corduroys "while
some invisible voice seemed to add, in an under tone of spectral
import—“ or leather breeches 1"
At length the eventful evening came—the night on which Blooms-
bury was, either for good or for evil—for weal or for woe, to decide—
“Whether 'twere better the breeks we have,
Or rush to corduroys we know not of "
For several days the corduroy party had been circulating patriotic
songs, of which the following is a specimen:—
How Long shall, the Parish.
How long shall our parish be shamed by the legs
Of the bandy, the crooked, the calfless, the bow
Shall Bloomsbury blush for those queer-looking pegs
Her children now stand on 1 Oh never, oh no l
Shall insolent scoffings be heartlessly thrown
At the spindle-like shanks of the muffin-capped boy
No 1 henceforth we’ll leave leather breeches alone,
Adopting the trousers of warm corduroy.
The evening fixed for the discussion was, of course, looked forward
to with the deepest interest; and every trustee felt the importance
of his trust as, with a mind fixed sternly on leathers or corduroys, he
repaired to the school-house in the churchyard of Bloomsbury.
Much was urged on both sides. For the leathers, it was inge-
niously argued, that whatever might be the state of the charity boys'

legs, they had taken their stand upon them from the foundation of
the charity; that there was no necessity to look at the matter in the
same light as an exhibition of calves at a cattle-show ; that the boys
often wanted leathering, and though corporeal punishment had gone
out of fashion, it was as well to bear the good old custom in remem-
brance.
A good deal was said on the side of corduroys; and one point in
their favour was very strongly urged—namely, their loyalty; for it
was pointed out, by an antiquarian trustee, that the word “corduroy”
is derived from the French words, “coeur de roi,” the heart of the
king, in allusion to the assumed partiality of Old KING Cole for
corduroy trousers. So, between one and the other, it was found
utterly impossible to bring the matter to a decision.
It is greatly to be regretted that the point has not been decided,
for the heart-burnings on the subject are frightful, and neighbour
can scarcely meet neighbour without a sinister glance, until the awful
case of “Conduroys rersus LEAthens" is definitively settled.

Qſìt 3ntiquarian $oriety.
The last meeting of the Antiquarian Society was devoted to a very
patient investigation into the origin and meaning of the phrase “Give him
the sack,” as applied to the ejection of an individual from some position
he had previously occupied.
MR. Pokeabout observed, that he had devoted nearly the whole of his
life to a deep and solemn research into this very curious question. He
begged leave to produce a portion of a sack; which, on being compared
with the garb of a monastic penitent, was found to be of the same cloth as
the sackcloth which the early martyrs were accustomed to rig themselves
out in when they started on an expedition for the purpose of doing
penance.
MR. Digaway was strongly of opinion that this sackcloth was given to
the martyrs when they set off on their pilgrimages; and thus it was said
of them that they had the sack on their departure. Peter of Putney, who
was the father of the old parochial pilgrims, had left behind him a remnant
of an old ballad; but fortunately only two lines of it had been preserved.
He (MR. DiGAway) said fortunately, for if the whole ballad were as poor
as the two lines that have been handed down to us, it was as well for the
º of PETER of Putney that only a single couplet remained.
FIear.
MR. GRuBEMUP, knowing that this discussion was about to come on,
had provided himself with a sack-but, which he begged leave to produce.
The ChaiBMAN did not exactly see the relation between the sack-but
and the act of giving the sack.
MR. GRUBEMUP would not press the suggestion, and begged leave to
withdraw the sack-but, which was unanimously agreed to.
The ChaiBMAN said that the woolsack was a curious instance of giving
the sack without sending a person away. He hoped the meeting under-
stood him. (Cries of “ Hear.”) When Lord BRough AM had the sack,
that is to say, the woolsack, he was not dismissed; but when he was dis-
missed, the sack, that is to say, the woolsack, was taken away from, instead
of being given to him.
A gentleman observed, that the expression “Give him the sack” is
probably as old as the Saxons. (Cries of “Who are you?” and “Turn
him out !”)
The gentleman here hastily left the room ; and thanks having been
voted to the hall-porter for his able conduct in the passage, the meeting
was adjourned.
PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY.
Of mills to grind old people green,
And bring back early prime ;
We’ve read in Christmas Tale, and seen
In Christmas Pantomime.
But magic of a converse hue
Assails, in hideous storm,
Whatever earthly things go through
Thy Club House, O Reform.
The Hat which, guiltless of a shower,
In virgin sleekness shone,
Will grow so vile in half an hour,
You'll blush to put it on.
Umbrellas, more especially
In bad or doubtful weather,
Not only rot and fade away,
But vanish altogether.
Your cane into a stick will change ;-
There's nothing in creation
But into something old and strange
Doth suffer transformation.
The following rule of life from hence
A prudent man will gather—
But no : I’ll not insult your sense :
I think you guess it—rather?
IPhilosophy and Horseflesh.
The EARL of CARDIGAN has lost two horses—pet hunters. And yet
his Lordship neither tore his hair, nor his moustachios; but, says a
Dublin paper, “heard of those losses with his usual equanimity and in-
difference, speaking of them as ordinary casualties 1” What the “ usual
equanimity” of the EARL of CARDIGAN is, may be learned, as Dutch
doctors learned diseases, from a bottle, a black bottle.
“THE RULING PASSION STRONG,” &c.
The proverbial good taste of GeoRGE IV. has even descended to his
equestrian statue in Trafalgar-square, for it turns its back upon the
National Gallery.

THE GREAT WESTERN STEAM SHIP.
EALLY the proprietors of this vessel have com-
menced a new aera in steam navigation. Great
men are sometimes said to have souls too large
for their bodies, and the company that have
built this ship have adopted this glorious idea,
by making a ship too large to be got out of the
dock it has been constructed in. GEORGE THE
Third was once puzzled to know how the apple
got into the dumpling; but here is a greater
puzzle still, for the question now is, how shall
the Great Western steam-ship be got out of the
dock 1 which is a greater mystery than its having got into it.
We know that this vessel was intended to be a standing monument to
the naval architecture of Great Britain, and no one can say that the idea
has not been realised. Various suggestions have been made as to the
release of the glorious craft, but at present it remains like a nut in its
shell, and the difficulty is a nut that cannot easily be cracked by ordinary
ingenuity.
º jºin is already appointed, with 150 gallant fellows under him, and
they daily go through the whole series of nautical, manºeuvres—such as
reefing the top-gallant, unshipping the sculls of the jolly boat, stowing
away the main jib, and piping all hands at three bells—all of which feats
they go through as punctually as if they were rolling about on the broad
Atlantic, instead of being embedded in the mud of the dry dock at Bristol.
* England expects that every man will do his duty;” and Captain Cockles,
with his gallant crew, also expects that every steamboat company will
keep its engagements, whether the vessel sails or not—it being no fault of
the jolly tars on board that this piece of naval ironmongery is dock-bound
on the premises of its builders.
LORD BROUGHAM'S DREAM.
“The foul, the false charge, that I have changed a single opinion.”—Vicar of Bray.
I DREAMT that I dined in Conservative halls,
With Peel and the Duke at my side ;
That I went like their shadow, to morning calls,
To concerts, the club, or the ride.
And seldom or never to meet, did I seem,
With a Whig or a Radical name ;
And yet—the most curious part of my dream—
My opinions were still the same !
And I dreamt of a Chancellor, (strangely, of course,
For my senses were running a rig,)
Who said that “ Persuasion was better than force,”
As he dazzled my eyes with his wig.
“Oh, beautiful wig 1" thought I, “could I for thee
Turn this coat Ay, or part with my name 1”
And yet—the most wonderful matter to me—
My opinions were still the same !
Tºaunch of the Boscawen.
Consider ABLE disappointment was manifested at the very extraordinary
conduct of the tide on Wednesday last, which came to its full exactly
three quarters of an hour earlier than in the course of nature and the
river Thames might have been looked for. It is well known that the
gambols of the tide at about the full of the moon are exceedingly fantastic,
and we are therefore surprised that the public should have put any faith
in the delusive legend on the occasion of the launch of the Boscawen. It
is a proverb that time and tide wait for no man, but it would seem that
the tide is more impatient even than the time, for while the company were
punctual to the latter, they found that the former had been a little too
quick for them. The Government has been a good deal blamed for not
having recollected that the moon was in perigee, and arranging accord-
ingly for its freaks. And we understand that in order to keep them au
fait to the changes of the Moon, the Sheriff has had orders to give notice
from time to time of his temporary residence.

THERE is very little doing in venison or fish, but a great demand for

Popular Delusions.
The undermentioned are remarkable modern instances of Popular
Delusions:—
1. The belief in Sir Robert PEEL's promise, that the Income Tax was
only to last for three years.
2. The idea, when the said Sir Robert last came into office, that he had
any particular intention except to retain it.
3. The ridiculous notion still entertained by a few very weak people,
that the Cabinet will make any attempt at legislation on the Corn Law,
Irish, or Duelling questions, or any other subject of national importance,
till agitation thereon shall have reached the verge of rebellion.
4. The supposition that Ministers, in the present posture of affairs,
know, in the slightest degree, what to do.
TEST OF MESMERISM,
(AUTHENTic.)
A strong proof of the infallibility of this much-disputed science was
adduced the other evening at a lecture on the subject. A boy being asked,
whilst in the mesmeric state, whether “The income-tax would be discon.
tinued after the third year, as Sia Roseat PEEL had promised " replied
“CERTAINLY Not l” This, upon being mentioned to the Premier, was
declared to be the strongest instance of “clairvoyance" that could be
brought forward in favour of the science.

LONDON CHARIVARI.
TELL INTELLIGIBLY TOLD.
ACT THE THIRD.
THE stage now's supposed to afford us a view
Of Altorf–the castle, and market-place too;
In honour of GEsler a fête is preparing.
The governor’s cap has come out for an airing,
'Tis placed on the top of a pole very high,
(The hat is a shocking bad hat by-the-bye),
And the people respect are directed to show to it,
By walking around it, and making a bow to it.
The fête now commences, the soldiers advance,
And force the Swiss maidens to join in the dance.
Men and women now awkwardly caper before us,
While the famed Tyrolian is heard as a chorus.
The dancing is over, when RUDOLPH and Tell
Appear not to like the movement over well.
Requesting with zeal which we can't understand,
The honour of dying in liberty's land.
But Gesi.ER, a tyrant inclin'd to be funny,
Is bent upon having some sport for his money,
And therefore proposes to TELL a free pardon 1
Upon a condition that's rather a hard 'un,
To shoot from the head of his son nothing more
Than an apple—TELL's heart has been pierced to the core.
But seeing not anything else can be done,
The hazard he boldly determines to run.
The bosom of TELL 'tis enough to be rippin';
But he says to his son, “Now, be steady, my pippin,
Don't move e'en the quarter or eighth of an inch,
If you think of your mother you’re sure not to flinch.”
Their places they take—Albertazzi kneels down,
With a thundering codlin surmounting her crown,
While TELL is preparing his arrows to shoot,
Avoiding his son, without missing the fruit.
A sort of mechanical trick that requires
The aid of some nearly invisible wires.
In spite of the compact that Gesleh had made,
He manages somehow the terms to evade,
For TELL had an arrow affixed to his button
Which GESLER's tyrannical eye was not shut on.
The chorus are very indignant indeed ;
They beg from oppression's strong grasp to be freed;
And GEsler—alarmed at the horrible yelp—
Concedes what no longer he's able to help. -
The people climb up to the trees and the roofs,
Of a general rising affording the proofs.
At GesleR defiance they lustily fling,
While the tyrant his exit effects at the wing.
Scene Two is the cottage of MelctiiAL, or rather
The little front garden of ARNold's late father;
It is an exterior.—ARNoLD has come
His vengeance to whet with a sight of his home.
He sings to the door-post, the knocker, the bell,
The objects he lov’d in his childhood so well;
And seems to imagine electrical fire
Is borne through his veins from the bell by the wire.
It seems with the singular purpose he's come
Of bidding eternal adieu to his home.
The act is absurd, he'd be sure to regret it ;
If not able to live in it, couldn't he let it !
'T is true, that his mind in condition just then a'n't,
For him to go looking about for a tenant :
But sure he might part with it just as it stands,
& putting it into a house-agent's hands.
et instead of proceeding to let or to sell,
He comes but to gaze on and bid it farewell.
Poor ARNOLD, with tear-drops bedeving his eye,
Is still to his property bidding good-bye,
When a chorus without on a sudden is heard,
In which “vengeance” is clearly the principal word.
In vengeance his energies suddenly centre,
When straightway a lot of conspirators enter.
They swear to the rescue of Tell they will fly,
Intending to level his dungeon or die.
At once by their energy ARNOLD's excited,
His country he seems quite resolved shall be righted.
He offers to lead them—“To Altorf,” says he,
“I know the defiles just at present are free.”
And showing the pathway by which they can quit,
He points with his sword to the side of the pit.
It follows, of course, if he “speaks by the card,”
That Altorf is somewhere near Vinegar-yard.
This somewhat absurd, geographical blunder
Is quickly forgot in the feeling of wonder,
Excited in all, by that marvel confest,
DUPREz's ut de poitrine, or C in the chest.
Oh, nothing in singing more splendid could be,
Than his soul-stirring “burst,” “Come with me ! Come with me!”
To vengeance and glory he offers to lead,
And quickly sets off at the top of his speed,
Tºwards the wing on the opposite prompt, and he reels,
(With the whole of the Chorus quite close at his heels);
Unable to stop, in an instant, his run,
He frequently falls over Manager BUNN,
Who often is standing, entranced with delight, -
At the famed “Come with me!” the grand hit of the night.
And then comes the curtain—and kicking and bawling,
The shouting, the yelling, the whistling, the calling—
Till out comes DUPREz with Miss RomeR to bow,
Thus putting an end—for one night—to the row.
TO AUTHORS, POETS, AND BOOKMAKERS IN GENERAL.
Th; proprietors of the Poetico-Prosaico-Assistant Establishment beg to
announce that their Assortment for the Season will contain a large
supply of ready-made Verses—Preserved rhymes—Moral sentences-
Piquant mottoes—Generally approved puns—Some excellent descriptions
—and two very superior bon-mots—also an immense assortment of para-
graphs, adapted to all subjects and circumstances, with moveable begin.
nings and ends, so managed that they may be fitted on to anything, and
furnished with appropriate commas, full-stops, and notes of interrogation.
Prize poems and essays got up at the shortest notice ;-Histories, voyages,
and travels compiled; and novels, sermons, memoirs, and grammars,
neatly composed and instantaneously published.
We subjoin a specimen of the poetical department of this establish-
ment :-
“'Tis done—and sickening in the gale,
Distempered breezes filter thro' the vale,
Tumultuous murmurs flash promiscuous dyes,
And limpid mermaids mangle o'er the skies.
No voice to break the silent stillness round,
Save the deep thunder of perpetual sound.
He died—he spoke--he breathed; no word
Marr'd the sweet music of that shrilly bird:
Earth was his home—his smouldering tomb the wave,
Whilst lustrous dew-drops purple round his grave.
Eternal silence laughs along the shore,
And spectral negroes whiten on the floor.

“Most excellent invention.”-South Sea Island and Australian General Advertiser.

blishment.”—Pekin Herald and Cape Horn Advertiser.

N.B. Windows, top-boots, and old pictures cleaned, and clocks and
characters taken to pieces and carefully inspected.
The Great Unaccountable again.
A very curious document has lately turned up, being a receipt for up-
wards of seventy pounds from ALDERMAN Gibbs; and what adds materially
to the interest, if not to the value of the article is the fact, that the item
to which it refers does not appear in the accounts of the worthy church-
warden, which were examined and found to be quite correct by, of course,
very competent auditors. As the parish was declared to be in debt to
the Alderman, there can be no doubt that he has made very extensive
payments from his own private pocket, of which, with a lavish liberality,
and disregard to self, he has kept no account whatever, . This will, we
are sure, more than balance the books of the rº churchwarden ;
and we therefore call on the public to suspend its judgment until the
Alderman's memory has had time to refresh itself, and bring to light some
forgotten item, that may be placed on the credit side of his account, with
a view to turning the scale again in his own favour.
Secondary Punishmentse
We understand that the Government is in treaty with MR. WIMBush
! for the purchase or hire of his omnibus, in order to use it as a vehicle
for the application of the solitary system to the punishment of minor
offences. It is proposed to sentence persons eonvicted of very small
| delinquencies to a journey from the police office to the Bank of England.

**. ow that the summer season is com-
cºw mencing at the different
- theatres, the little band-box
in Dean-street (No. 71 A),
we understand, will shortly
le opened. The fair mana-
geress has been recruiting
her Company at the Ser-
vants' Bazaar in Oxford-
street; and the persons en-
aged are to meet in the back
j of the establishment
on an early day, preparatory
to the opening.
The alterations since the
last season have been very
extensive, including the lay-
ing down of a new dresser,
which it is expected will
admit of a number of scenic
effects of a peculiar and novel
character. The parlour-win-
dow, or proscenium, has been
repainted, and the folding-
doors have been entirely
taken away, so that when it
is thrown open from back to
front a splendid area (with
regular area steps) presents itself.
Among the popular pieces to be performed are, the First Floor, the
Double Bedded Room, the Angel of the Attic, and other dramas appro-
priate to the locality where they will be acted.
MR. HAMILTON, who made such an impression in Irish characters,
will probably appear as Teddy the Tiler, which will be got up with real
tiles—the scene being laid on the roof of the wash-house.
The following opening Address will, we believe, be spoken :-
MELPoMENE, delicious maid, shall be
A real maid of all work unto me;
And, if a kitchen-maid I should require,
Into my service I will take Thalia.

Of Cookes, the stage has had, alas ! but one ;
I mean GEORGE FREDERick—aid, then, I implore ye,

open the wash-house a quarter of an hour before the time at which the
half-price is usually admitted.

the
HISTORY OF THE NEXT FRENCH REVOLUTION.
[From a forthcoming History of Europe.]
CHAP. IX.-LOUIS XVII.
THE tremendous cannomading, however, had a singular effect upon the inhabitants of
the great public hospital of Charenton, in which it may be remembered Louis XVII. had
been, as in mockery, confined. His majesty of demeanour, his calm deportment, the
reasonableness of his pretensions, had not failed to strike with awe and respect his four
thousand comrades of captivity. The Emperor of China, the Princess of the Moon ;
Julius Caesar; Saint Genevieve, the patron saint of Paris; the Pope of Rome ; the
Cacique of Mexico; and several singular and illustrious personages, who happened to be
confined there, all held a council with Louis XVII.; and all agreed that now or never
was the time to support his legitimate pretensions to the Crown of France. As the
cannons roared around them, they howled with furious delight in response—they took
counsel together—Doctor Pinel and the infamous jaileurs, who, under the name of keepers,
held them in horrible captivity, were pounced upon and overcome in a twinkling. The
strait-waistcoats were taken off from the wretched captives languishing in the dungeons;
the guardians were invested in these shameful garments, and with triumphant laughter
plunged under the Douches. The gates of the prison were flung open, and they marched
forth in the blackness of the storm 1
+ + + + + + + + +
On the third day, the cannonading was observed to decrease; only a gun went off fitfully
now and then.
+ * + + + - + +
On the fourth day, the Parisians said to one another, “Tiens ! is sont fatigués, les
canonniers des forts t—and why? Because there was no more powder –Ay, truly, there
was no more powder.
There was no more powder, no more guns, no more gunners, no more forts, no more
nothing. The forts had blown each other up. The battle-roar ceased. The battle-clouds rolled
off. The silver moon, the twinkling stars, looked blandly down from the serene azure,
and all was peace—stillness—the stillness of death. Holy, holy silence 1
Yes; the battle of Paris was over. And where were the combatants All gone—not
one left 1–And where was Louis Philippe The venerable Prince was a captive in the
Tuileries. The Irish brigade was encamped around it. They had reached the palace a
little too late ; it was already occupied by the partisans of his Majesty Louis XVII.
That respectable monarch and his followers better knew the way to the Tuileries than
the ignorant sons of Erin. They burst through the feeble barriers of the guards; they
rushed triumphant into the kingly halls of the palace; they seated the seventeenth Louis
on the throne of his ancestors; and the Parisians read in the Journal des Débats of the fifth
of November, an important article, which proclaimed that the civil war was concluded.
“The troubles which distracted the greatest empire in the world are at an end. Europe,
which marked with sorrow the disturbances which agitated the bosom of the Queen of
Nations, the great leader of Civilisation, may now rest in peace. That monarch whom
we have long been sighing for; whose image has lain hidden, and yet, oh! how passion-
ately worshipped in every French heart, is with us once more. Blessings be on him ;
blessings—a thousand blessings upon the happy country which is at length restored to his
beneficent, his legitimate, his reasonable sway !
“His Most Christian Majesty, Louis XVII, yesterday arrived at his palace of the
Tuileries, accompanied by his august allies. His Royal Highness the Duke of Orleans has
resigned his post as Lieutenant-General of the kingdom, and will return speedily to take
up his abode at the Palais Royal. It is a great
mercy that the children of his Royal Highness,
who happened to be in the late forts round
Paris, (before the bombardment which has so
happily ended in their destruction,) had re-
turned to their father before the commence-
ment of the cannonading. They will continue,
as heretofore, to be the most loyal supporters
of order and the throne.
“None can read without tears in their eyes

the old prophecy warned me. He gave me up the keys of his gold;
I shall know well how to use it. Taught by adversity, I am not a

noble institutions instead of diabolical forts. I will have no more
cannon founded. They are a curse, and shall be melted—the iron

“Some alarm was created yesterday by the arrival of a body of the
English foot-guard under the Duke of JEN KINs ; they were at first
about to sack the city, but on hearing that the banner of the lilies
was once more raised in France, the Duke hastened to the Tuileries,
and offered his allegiance to his Majesty. It was accepted : and the
Plush-GUARD has been established in place of the Swiss, who
waited on former sovereigns.”
“The Irish brigade quartered in the Tuileries are to enter our
service. Their commander states that they took every one of the
forts round Paris, and having blown them up, were proceeding to
release Louis XVII., when they found that august monarch, happily,
free. News of their glorious victory has been conveyed to Dublin,
to his Majesty the King of the Irish. It will be a new laurel to add
to his green crown l’”
And thus have we brought to a conclusion our history of the great
French Revolution of 1884. It records the actions of great and
various characters; the deeds of various valour: it narrates wonder-
ful reverses of fortune; it affords the moralist scope for his phi-
losophy; perhaps it gives amusement to the merely idle reader.
Nor must the latter imagine, because there is not a precise moral
affixed to the story, that its tendency is otherwise than good. He is
a poor reader, for whom his author is obliged to supply a moral
application. It is well in spelling-books and for children; it is needless
for the reflecting spirit. The drama of Punch himself is not moral :
but that drama has had audiences all over the world. Happy he,
who in our dark times can cause a smile ! Let us laugh then, and
gladden in the sunshine, though it be but as the ray upon the pool,
that flickers only over the cold black depths below !
A RIDE IN THE HOUNSLOW MAIL,
He Hounslow Mail, as every one is aware,
has the form of a common cab, but it is in
spirit a government vehicle, owing allegiance
to the Post-office. Urged by a love of
adventure, we determined to have a ride in
the Hounslow mail, and responded there-
fore to the earnest invitation of the driver,
who is continually yelping and shouting
along the road, until he obtains the “two
insides,” allowed him as perquisites. We
could not help regarding it as rather disgraceful to the royal arms
and the public service, that a cab emblazoned with the one and a
man employed in the other, should be devoted to an unseemly rivalry
with the ordinary omnibuses, and that an individual wearing HEa
Majesty's livery should be roaring out “C’ty, B'nk,” “Takeyer for
the same as the bus,” while the whole correspondence of Hounslow
was under his care, and should have engrossed the whole of his
attention.
Having been hailed by the driver we entered the Hounslow Mail,
the interior of which is built on the model of a double sedan chair,
while the roof is inscribed with a sort of Government proclamation
intimating that the vehicle is “constructed for two insides,” a fact
which is enforced by a crown and the royal initials being placed
immediately over it.
Nothing particular occurred in the early part of the journey. We
had got in at the two-mile stone, and passed the celebrated Half-way
house, at which STEELE is said to have written the tenth number of
the Tatler, and Johnson is supposed to have dined at the expense of
Boswell, after the memorable advance made by the latter on the
strength of the subscriptions to the Dictionary. We continued
wrapped in silent contemplation—on the subject, no doubt, of the
Half-way house—when suddenly the Hounslow Mail made a precipi-
tate bolt to the right, and we found ourselves whirled along a sort
of ravine of iron railings, terminating in a species of military outpost,
where the mail stopped short, and the door of an adjacent out-house
being thrown open, a scene of almost painful interest presented
itself.
Before a rudely-constructed bench, consisting of a deal plank
elevated on a couple of tressels, were a number of men, two of whom
had gold hat-bands, while one who seemed the chief wore the red
collar of the order of St. Martin's-le-Grand. They were all en
in sorting letters, and as the rays of the sun fell through the skylight
upon that busy group, we thought that if Rembrandt had resided in
Trevor Square, or if Carlo Dolce had lodged at Knightsbridge, “the
letter-sorters” might have been immortalised in the Galleries of the
Louvre, or on the walls of the Vatican. Our driver now became
impatient; he shouted lustily for the bags, when a curious alternative
was offered to him by a person within, who politely desired to know
whether he (the driver of the Mail) would have the bags at once, or
wait till he got them. To this no answer was returned in words,
though in effect there was a reply, for the driver did wait till the
bags were brought, and then he gallopped off in a southerly direction
for a couple of yards, when he again plunged to the east, a fact which
we ascertained by comparing our course with an adjacent weather-
cock. The rest of the land we travelled over is too well known
to need description. Caesar, in his Commentaries, speaks of Cis-
Alpine Gaul, which means that part of Gaul which is on this side of
the Alps. We, however, do not think it necessary to say anything
about Cis-Knightsbridgian London, or London on this side of
Knightsbridge.
Such was our ride in the Hounslow Mail. It is, perhaps, worthy
of remark, that though every mail is bound to carry fire-arms, the
Hounslow Mail is wholly unprotected by any weapon except the
whip, and as there is no room for the guard, he meets the vehicle
on its arrival, the other guard having been present at its starting, so
that one seeing it safe off, and the other seeing it safe in, renders its
security complete, without troubling any one to take the journey.
PITCH AND TOSS AND THE TURF.
An immoral movement was very summarily suppressed at Stepney
Fair, on Easter Monday. Peter DRAPER, a speculative pieman,
and Thomas WELLING, a boy, were taken in the act of performing
pitch and toss; and, brought up at the Thames police, were sentenced
for the iniquity to seven days’ imprisonment. This reckless gambling
for pies it is very proper to put down ; the best interests of society
demand its suppression; the more especially as, at the forthcoming
Derby, there will, we understand, be a large body of police at Epsom
to take into custody any noblemen or gentlemen who may desire to
try their luck at rouge et noir and roulette. If piemen are to be
punished, peers, of course, cannot be allowed to escape. However,
we cannot, for more than one reason, regret the incarceration of the
pieman and the boy gambler, such circumstance having awakened
the sympathy of several illustrious individuals known to the turf.
We understand that the DUKE or Richmond, Colon El PEEL, and
others, lost no time in paying a visit of condolence to the pieman and
the boy, who having, doubtless in their ignorance, broken the law,
had not sufficient interest to have it tinkered anew for their especial
advantage. The noble duke and gallant colonel left at the prison
very substantial evidence of their sympathy; namely, a large pigeon
pie, with a ten pound note for their unfortunate brethren the sport.

THE WAKE OF TEDDY ROE.
I.
In Dublin, that city of riches and fame,
A fishmonger lived, Teddy Roe was his name;
The neighbours all grieved, rich, poor, high, or low,
And to wake with poor Teddy they resolved to go.
Mr. O'Dogherty, the coachman, was sent for immediately.
Now you see, Dogherty, we want you to drive us clean and
decently to Teddy Roe's wake. By the powers he has taken
it into his head to die, so he would not be very well pleased
if we neglected calling on him, so drive away with the most
beautiful
Mistress Delaney, Mistress Blaney,
Mister Fagan, and Miss Doe,
Who in a coach all went to wake with Teddy Roe.
II.
All bedizen’d so fine in their best Sunday clothes,
Miss Doe's squinting eyes, Mister Fagan's red nose,
At poor Ted's they arrived where they had been oft
before,
And Dogherty gave a loud thump at the door.
Out hobbles Phelim, Teddy's uncle. Arrah, is it yourself
that comes to wake with poor Ted P−he's up in the cock loft
taking a parting glass of Innoshone with a few friends, so be
after walking up the ladder if you please—Sciape your feet,
Judy, Judy, the quality is come. Walk up, ladies, the punch
will soon be ready, and we'll all get drunk for sorrow.
III.
Returning a coach full of whisky and grief,
By old Dogherty driven, of coachmen the chief;
But objects turned round, and he could not tell how,
For he upset the quality all in a slough.
Hiatus valde deflendus.
IV.
Then be-mudded without, and with whisky within,
They arrived at old Dogherty's, and all stagger'd in,
Such figures of fun 'twill be said for their sake,
Sure never before were seen at a wake.
Bless us, Dogherty, what are you bringing home? where
did you pick 'em up, jewell ? Oh, don't bother me, and you
will get the whole account as clear as mud; but Judy, we must
first wash the most beautiful, &c.
WHO
IS TO BE THE CHIEF BARON P
His important ques-
tion will perhaps be
answered before this
number of Punch gets into
the nation's hands, but at
this present writing it is a
question which sadly agi-
tates the waistcoats—we had
nearly said the hearts—of
and has fluttered the pens of
the press to an extent re-
minding us of the effect pro-
duced at Corioli, when Coriolanus played the
arduous character of the eagle to the doves of
the Volscians. Almost every newspaper has had
its pet chief baron—or its favourite attorney
or solicitor-general.
Some suggest Pollock, and if it were put to
a show of pens no doubt SIR FREDER1ck would
be at once appointed chief baron ; but then
some one else thinks one of the Puisnes ought
to be promoted, and that either PARKE, ALDER-
son, or Ro1.FE ought to be taken out of the
judicial chorus and raised to the dignity of primo
&asso at the Court of Exchequer. PARKE has
many very eminent lawyers,
certainly a fine dignified appearance, and would
“make up,” as the theatrical phrase goes, un-
commonly well for the part of chief baron. His
voice too, which is a pleasant baritone, would
be invaluable in a judgment on a motion for a
rule to show cause ; but for the less laboured
passages of the judicial character, such as the
light comedy bow of assent to an application
for judgment as in case of a nonsuit, “upon
the usual affidavit,” we think that the style of
PARKE is hardly suitable. Mn. BARoN ALDER-
son would, we think, be found highly effective
in what might be termed the light comedy of
the judicial office. His keen relish for humour,
and his occasional smartness—though with truly
legal veneration for precedent, he seldom fa-
vours us with a pun that may not be found “in
the books”—would render him very desirable
as chief in some of those heavy questions between
landlord and tenant, where a bare right is a most
unexciting subject of discussion unless relieved by
occasional jocularity from the bench—a cue that
can only be properly given by the learned chief,
when it is sure to be seized upon by the Puisnes
and the bar with due alacrity. MR. BARoN Rolf E
is a very valuable acquisition to any company
of judicial performers. He is always very
perfect in his part, knows his business
uncommonly well, and is remarkable,
not for “suiting the action to the word,”
for he never strains the case to meet
the letter of the law, which is what
SHAkspeaRE evidently had in his eye;
but he always “suits the word to the
action,” that is to say, he invariably
adapts the judgment to the merits.
With regard to the Solicitor-General-
ship, KELLY was unquestionably the
favourite, but some recommended Mr.
THEsigER, on account of his elegance;
and others urged the claims of Mr.
WoRT LEY, because he is likely to
know the law when he has learnt it,
and because he is already the son of
Lord WHARNcLIFFE. The elegance of
Mr. Thesigen certainly points him out
as a proper person for the part of Soli-
citor-General, supposing the “making
up” to be of paramount importance.
The pretensions of MR. WoRT LEY
are not quite so palpable to us. We
have no doubt that the Solicitor-Gene-
ralship would be a capital school for
any gentleman desirous of learning the
law ; but then, unfortunately, there are
two parties to a case of this kind—
the gentlemen anxious to learn, and
the public, desirous of having an efficient
officer. If the Solicitor-General might
begin with small motions, asking for
computes, perhaps for the first year of
office, and getting gradually up into
applications for distringases, passing
through the ordeal of having occasion-
ally to show cause instead of simply to
“hand in,” then we should say that a
Lord's son, “likely to become a good
lawyer when he should have learnt the
law,” might be a very proper person for
the office of Attorney-General.
The Polka Mania.
The Timesteems with the advertisements
of individuals who are prepared to instruct
the public in the mysteries of the Polka.
Every Professor of the Terpsichorean art
has got hold of a version of this dance,
which he declares to be the only genuine
edition. One has been to Paris on purpose
to learn it; another has acquired it in Ger-
many; and a third, a young lady, has been
taught the dance by a Bohemian nobleman.
We know that noblemen sometimes cut
very odd capers; but fancy an English
Peer going over to Germany to teach “Sir
Roger de Coverley,” or a Professor in one
of our Universities visiting Bohemia for
the purpose of introducing the College
hornpipe.
Theatrical Intelligence.
We are happy to announce that a Private
Box for the Season at Miss KELLY's Theatre
has been secured by the passenger in
WIMBush's Omnibus, who will thus have
an opportunity of, at the same time, patro-
nising the drama, and gratifying his in-
curable passion for solitude. The same
individual attended Drury Lane Theatre
on Tuesday during the performance of
the “ Tale of Mystery,” but was much
disappointed at finding his seclusion par
tially disturbed by the presence of nearly
thirty individuals.

AssumEDLY the fact is not so well known as it deserves to be, that
NApoleon, who by the act shewed himself a miserable dwarf
indeed—bequeathed, in a codicil to his will, the sum of 10,000 francs
(400l.) to a man charged with an attempt to murder the DUKE of
WELLING-Ton. We subjoin the extract from the will, which may
be seen at Doctors’ Commons on the payment of one shilling. The
codicil bears date, April 25, 1821, and the magnanimous testator
died on the 5th of May, ten days afterwards; dying, as he declared
in the preamble to his last testament, “in the Apostolical and
Catholic Church 1” Here is the proof of his Christianity,+
“5. idem (10,000) Dix mille francs au sous-officier CANTIL lon, qui a

sur le rocher de Sainte-Hélène. WELLINGTon, qui a proposé cet
attentat, cherchait à le justifier sur l’intérêt de la Grande-Bretagne.
Cantillon, si vraiment il eat assassiné le lord, se serait couvert et
aurait eté justifié parles mémes motifs: l’intérêt de la France de se
défaire d'un général, qui d'ailleurs avait violé la capitulation de Paris,
et par läs'était rendu responsable du sang des martyrs Ney, Labé-
doyère, &c. &c., et du crime d’avoir dépouillé les musées, contre le
texte des traités.”
We subjoin a translation :-
“Ten thousand francs to the subaltern CANTILLoN, who under-
went a trial charged with an attempt to assassinate Lord WELLING-

We cannot forbear calling on the public to admire the praiseworthy
effort of MI. Keeley to distinguish himself in a new line of his pro-

quity, sought to justify it by the interests of Great Britain. Can-
Tillon, if he had really assassinated his lordship, would hare been ercused
and justified by the like motires—the interest of France to rid herself of
a general who had violated the treaty of the capitulation of Paris,
and by that act had rendered himself responsible for the blood of
the martyrs NEY, Labédoyène, &c. &c.; and for the crime of
despoiling the museums, contrary to the text of treaties 1 "

44 wishes to kill him ; but I have told him that I shall
remonstrate : I have likewise said that, as a private friend, I advised
him to have nothing to do with so foul a transaction ; and that he
and I had acted too distinguished parts in those transactions to
become executioners; and that I was determined that, if the
sovereigns wished to put him to death, they should appoint an execu-
tioner, which should not be me.”— Wide Lieut.-Colonel Gurwood's Selec.
tions from the Duke of Wellington's Dispatches, No. 965, p. 870.
Be it understood that we are not blind idolators of the Duke of
WELLINgtoN. He has made his political blunders, and in his time
talked political nonsense as well as his inferiors. Moreover, he ex-
hibits a defective sympathy with the people; as the Examiner has
admirably said of him, he looks upon them as a mere appanage to the
Crown. Certainly, the “iron Duke” wants a little kindly expansion
towards the masses. Nevertheless, contrasting WELLINGton's
answer to the proposed death of the ex-Emperor, with NApoleon's
reward of the would-be assassin of the General, need we ask which
is the Giant, and which the Dwarf
MR. KEELEY is the modern Garrick—for, while Comedy has collared
him on one side, Tragedy is tugging at the skirt of his coat on the other.
His Hassarac is one of the most impressive pieces of acting ever seen on
the British planks, or illuminated by the British footlights. From the
moment of his entrance on his courser, he seems to be the desperate but
conscious-stricken bandit, and his retiring to lean against the proscenium
after his deadly combat with Abdallah, is a touch of mature, at least a
touch of that nature that few could imitate. It seems to say, “Yes; I am
rightly served, for guilt like the wasp has always a sting !” And again, in
the second act, when he appears as the merchant, his confusion at being
detected with the carving knife up his sleeve, is a glorious specimen of the
working of disappointment in a mind already worn down by frequent
foiling. His look when ultimately recognised as the bandit, tells in the
glance of an eye the story of a life. #. seems to revert to his days of
boyhood with a fondness and a tender yearning that bespeak “ the heart
| bowed down,” as MR. BuNN, comparing human feelings to a porter's knot,
sº elegantly expresses it. All who can appreciate true tragedy should see
MR. Keeley in Hassarac. The absence of MR. MacReady from England
gives it at the present moment additional consequence, and we trust the
sensation will subside before the return of the regular tragedian.
“PUNCH." TO THE “ MORNING CHRONICLE.”
Punch presents his compliments to the editor of the Morning Chro-
nicle, and begs to refer him to his foreign leader of Monday last, in
which the mountebank scoundrel BRAvo is spoken of as “the editor
of the Madrid Punch.” Now, as Punch has never yet confounded the
editor of the Morning Chronicle with BARNARD GRegory of the
Satirist, it is not too much to ask of the aforesaid daily writer a
similar attention when alluding to the aforesaid BRAvo. Punch has
no more in common with BRAvo's Guiregay than has the Morning
Chronicle with GREgony's Satirist.
Iliterary Intelligence.
We understand a new edition of “How To Live on £50 A YEAR."
will shortly be published. It will be dedicated, by permission, to the
Lord Mayor, as being the best practical authority on the subject.
ALARMING CIRCUMstance.—MR. FERRAND has “given up Str Robert
Peel.” Nevertheless. on inquiry at the Baronet's residence, we were
happy to find him “as well as could be expected.”

THE “STRONG WIND” IN ST. MARTIN'S CHURCH.
unch has the pleasure to record an interesting
event which occurred on Tuesday, the 9th instant.
Not-EN-A-AKM, or “the Strong Wind,” inter-
preter of the Ojibbeway Indians, was married to
* SARAH HAINEs, which name, translated into the
Ojibbeway language, means “the London Fog.”
| The ceremony was performed in St. Martin's
Church. The Ojibbeway Indians attended, and,
with a fine sense of the struggles of matrimonial
life, appeared in their war-paint.
Some folks have grumbled at this
union; they know nothing of history.
The truth is, as we will prove, we owe
a large dividend of wives to American
savages, and SARAH HAINEs, or “the
London Fog,” is only the first instal-
ment of a long-standing debt.
In April, 1613, PRINcess Pocahontas gave her maiden
hand to John Rolf E, “a discreet young Englishman.”
Yes; “in the little church of Jamestown,” says the his-
torian, “which rested on pine columns fresh from the
forest, and was in a style of rugged architecture, as wild,
if not as frail, as an Indian wigwam,” did the beautiful
Virginian savage become MRs. John Rolf E. This event
happened two hundred and thirty-one years ago, and we
have been in debt to the Indians ever since. We put it to
MR. HUME, or any other subtle arithmetician, to calculate
the amount of our liabilities. Multiply one wife by two
hundred and thirty-one, adding thereto compound interest
on the accumulating amount, and our debt to the savages
must be something very serious. However, we have begun,
though in a small manner, to liquidate it ; we have given
“the London Fog” to “the Strong Wind,” and trust that
Pennsylvanian bondholders will take example by our
honesty.
We have a superabundant female population. This fact is on all
hands allowed and deplored. We see an easy remedy for this. Let
parties of Indians be imported. Let us have samples of the Chip-
pewas, the Dog-Ribbed, the Sioux, the Chactaws—indeed, a company
of every tribe of wild men, from Hottentots to Greenlanders—and
let them be let loose in our various towns for the sole purpose of
captivating the hearts, and so carrying away in lawful wedlock, our
superabundant females. By this means we shall honestly liquidate
our long-standing debt to the savage, and shall, at the same time,
relieve ourselves of over-populousness. War-paint, glass beads,
tattoo-work, and tomahawks, have a sweet and proper influence on
the female mind. What says the splenetic Philip Van Artevelde 2–
gº the women's heaven
Is vanity, and that is over all.
What's firiest still finds favour in their eyes;
What's noisiest keeps the entrance of their ears;
The noise and blaze of arms enchants them most.
Wit, too, and wisdom, that's admired of all,
They can admire—the glory, not the thing.
An unreflected light did never yet
Dazzle the vision feminine.”
From which caustic philosophy we may gather this fact, that a savage,
to be considered “quite a love” by a civilised maiden, must first be
exhibited in front of the lamps.
However, as the romantic devotion shown by Miss SARAH HAINEs,
or, “the London Fog,” for Not-EN-A-AKM, or “the Strong Wind,”
will doubtless become a fashion among our too susceptible country-
women, we only perform a public duty in enumerating a few of the
accomplishments required by a North American Indian of his wife
or squaw. She tills the ground, she digs, she sows, she reaps: she
pounds the parched corn; she dries the buffalo meat; she carries
home the game that her husband kills; she hews wood and draws
the water; she builds the wigwam, and in times of journeying carries
the poles upon her shoulder. Think of this, young ladies, and say
whether it is not more pleasant to hatch canary birds in white satin,
and work puppies' heads in Berlin wool However, for the ruder
and more picturesque operations, “the London Fog” is, doubtless,
duly prepared ; and, therefore, let us return to the sacrifice of the
bride, “attired in flowing white,” with a “wreath of orange blossoms
circling her hair,” in St. Martin's Church.
The ceremony was particularly solemn. When “the London Fog”
was asked if she would take “the Strong Wind” for her “wedded
husband,” she replied “I will,” with an emphasis that showed she had
duly weighed the responsibilities of hewing, and delving, and shoul-
dering the wigwam poles. “The Strong Wind,” in the most charming
way, took the ring from his nose, and placed it on the finger of “the
London Fog.” He then in the “most graceful manner” kissed his
bride, to the satisfaction of everybody, “the London Fog” included.
MRs. Ellis, we were happy to perceive, was in the church, and in
the handsomest manner presented to Mas. “STRoNG WIND” The
Wives of England, bound in hymeneal white satin ; with a copy of her
forthcoming work, entitled Can Woman make a Lobster-Salad 2
It will particularly gratify our female readers to learn that “the
Strong Wind" has promised “the London Fog,” on their return to
America, to take no other wife, but to remain constant, “ solely to
her.” Should “the Strong Wind” break this pledge, of course “the
London Fog” will have the readiest redress at any of the Ecclesias-
tical Courts to be found in the back woods.
When the bridegroom led the bride to her carriage, there was a
shout from the multitude, evidently meant as an approval of the fine
moral courage of a young lady, who gives up the sickly refinements
of civilized life for the invigorating comforts of savage existence.
When the carriage drove off, the crowd shouted again, and the crowd
was right; for “the Strong Wind” had carried away, for good and
all, “the London Fog.”
“The Strong Wind” exhibited himself with his friends, the
Ojibbeways, the day after his marriage; and it says much for the
liberality of the keeper of the show, that the public were allowed to
see the bridegroom without the charge of an additional sixpence.
“The London Fog” was to have been visible at the Egyptian Hall,
but was prevented by her friends. She ought to have exhibited ; it
would have been in complete keeping with the pure taste that dictated
the marriage.
It is only due to MR. RANKIN, the showman, to observe that
he managed the wedding with a fine eye to all advertising pur-
poses.

EYES AND ASSES.
MARY WAI.sh is brought before MR. TRAIL, at Union Hall,
charged by John CAMPBEll, with “stabbing him in the eye with a
pair of scissors.” The man is likely to lose the sight of the eye : the
assault was unprovoked,—the woman running like a wild beast at
the man, and she is fined, for inflicting a wound that may cause the
loss of an eye, the sum of—forty shillings
On the same day, at the same office, FRANcis PENNY is charged
with cruelty to a donkey. He beat it over its hinder quarters so as
to make the blood run in streams. He was fined by Ma. Thail in
the sum of—forty shillings.
Thus, John CAMPBell may look at the “hinder quarters” of an
ass, and, upon the authority of a magistrate, know them to be as
precious as the eye of a man; for both are labelled at Union Hall—
“price, forty shillings.”
Now, in these days of commercial enterprise, it is well that a man
should know his own value; we mean that he should be minutely
acquainted with the price which the law sets upon his organs and
inembers. In many instances this knowledge may operate in the
most beneficial manner, taking the spot of conceit out of a man's
mind as surely as the best chemical compound will remove grease
or claret stains. Now, reader, you who bend your orbs upon
this our starry type—what think you, weighed in the balance of a
police-office, your eyes are worth They may have a squint in them
—they may be poor, dull, inexpressive, dreamy eyes, yet of the first
value to you ; certainly you would not part with them for diamonds,
no, not for the famous Mountain of Light, could it be paired. Or
your eyes may be of inimitable brightness, making women put up
their parasols as they come near them—eyes, murderous of hearts;
amortal to the peace of families. Well, sir, and what think you,
weighed by a sworn magistrate, those eyes are worth : Why, you
find, just so much bruised and bleeding ass's flesh; there is no diffe-
rence in the eye of the law—(by the way, judges always talk of the
eye of the law, although justice is said to be blind; a proof that law
and justice cannot be the same thing,)—between your visual organs
and an ass's hind quarters.
Certainly, we would not have those who ill-treat the beast go
unpunished; but in the police markets, is it quite right to value the
quarters of an ass at the same rate as the eyes of a man?
“THE CUCKoo's NEST,”
OR, THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSTITUTE.
A UNch,-As a member of the British and
Foreign Institute, allow me to remonstrate
with you on the tone of very heartless
banter pervading your articles on a most
admirable institution, and on a most inde-
fatigable and excellent person, the parent
thereof; by the parent, understand me, I
mean MR. SILK BuckINGHAM—yes, sir,
Silk, and not Cuckoo Buckingham, as,
* since the appearance of your articles, I
ºf have heard that gentleman denominated by the risible and
the unthinking.
It is pleasant, sir, to me, to recall an ungrateful world to
a due sense of the merits of MR. BuckINGHAM. What that
gentleman has, by the gentle force of a constitutional modesty,
done for the world, who can tell ? I pass, sir, his services in
India—they were immense ; and by no means overpaid by
the subscription raised in England. But, sir, is it possible for
even a giddy, heartless metropolis to forget that gigantic project
of MR. Bucking HAM, when (I have the prospectus before me,) he
proposed, upon the sale of a certain number of shares, to buy or hire
a line-of-battle ship, in which families might safely circumnavigate
the globe Who can imagine the benefits to science promised by
such a scheme 1 The heretofore unknown animals discovered—the
new medicinal plants and gums added to our Pharmacopoeia—a
phoenix caught, for what we could tell—and unicorns shipped for a
royal present What glorious visions arose from that prospectus—
what day-dreams of beauty, and utility, and power I
Among other touching invitations to families to circumnavigate
the globe, was the advantage of education for the younger branches.
At various countries, the ship was to lay at anchor, whilst the chil-
-
dren went ashore and learned the language and the customs of the
place The sports and pastimes were also to be observed; the
throwing of the bomerang, among others, and the pulling of the long-
bow, which last accomplishment, by the way, was to be taught by a
sufficient master aboard the ship. The project came to nothing,
albeit money was subscribed, and, of course, duly accounted for ;
but everything was arranged for the voyage, even to the purchase of
buckets and wash-hand basins, with the hiring of wet-nurses,
when, unfortunately, the ill-health of MR. BuckINGHAM—stopt the
voyage.
After this, Ma. Buckingham retired into the graceful seclusion
of private life; but he was made for the world, and the world for
him. Therefore, MR. Bucking HAM, animated by the purest philan-
thropy, beset himself to found the British and Foreign Institute 1
Ye Gods, how he laboured at the noble endeavour ! Well, MR. Punch,
he gained the patronage of that very estimable nobleman, the Earl
of Devon—he founded the Club—he opened it—and, what is more,
by some peculiar charm of manner, he induced PRINcE ALBERT,
the QUEEN’s husband, to come to his house-warming
Now, sir, a thoughtless world may sneer, but I say a man who can
do all this—a man who is not heard of one month, and in little more
than a month after is, as it were, a king, in a palace of his own in
A striking contrast.
Hanover-square—a palace hired, furnished, and appointed for him
by other people (his most obedient subjects), such a man, sir, is, I
declare, a genius—an absolute genius; a Napoleon, sir—yea, a Napo-
leon of the breeches' pocket.
Therefore, MR. Punch, it is with some contempt for you, and with
unbounded admiration for MR. SILK Bucking HAM, that I subscribe
myself,
Your obedient Servant,
A MEMBER of the INstitut E,
AND THEREFor E A PATRoN of Cuckoos.
[We have, of course, given insertion to this letter, and can only
regret that our correspondent should have mistaken for an instant
our feelings towards MR. BuckinghAM. We have the greatest vene-
ration for that gentleman's talents; in proof of which we intend to
give a plan of the British and Foreign Institute, (MR. Bucking-
HAM’s palace,) duly marking the rooms devoted to the members, and
the rooms occupied by MR. BuckINGHAM. We think it impossible
to shew a stronger sense of that gentleman's vast and vigorous
genius.-Punch.]
Gibbs, for Mayor.
ALDERMAN Gibbs, in the handsomest way, and to save the Court of
Aldermen any trouble, has already elected himself Lord Mayor, and will
on the 9th of November proceed per fourpenny steamer to Westminster,

AMERICAN Mercy.
Jonathan's heart of dollars has somewhat relented. The white man,
sentenced to be hanged in Louisiana for aiding the Quadroon slave in an
attempt to escape from bondage is not, it seems, to be executed. He is
only to be publicly whipped. Hence, the American flag may retain its
significant stripes.

WE have been very much astonished, have been very indignant at
an account published throughout the press, of the funeral of Thor-
wallseN, the sculptor, who was buried at Copenhagen on the 30th
ult, their Majesties of Denmark attending the ceremony. Yes;
royalty, “in deep mourning,” received the body of a dead sculptor.
If anything can bring the kingly office into disregard, it must be
such unseemly acts as these. “At the entry of the church, his

A LEAF FROM FUTURE “ HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF

BY LORD BROUGHAM.
T this time (April, 1844) it was that two lieutenancies
of counties became vacant. Will it be he-
lieved — can it be conceived—imagined—
entertained by the brain of any rational
human being, that both these lieutenancies
were conferred upon one man—LoRD Lons-
DALE 1 And at this time there was a states-
man, who, in addition to the inborn claims
of a gigantic intellect, had a local claim upon
at least one of these counties. Can it be believed that Ministers were so
treacherous, base, stupid, crass, and so ignominiously unmindful of the
services of that great and distinguished man as to pass him over in
such people. Certainly not; they are kept in their proper places,
and are never suffered to run about palaces as, we regret to state,
they most certainly do on the benighted Continent. Imagine, for a
moment, English royalty “in deep mourning” for departed genius ! A

PUBLIC MEETING IN THE STRAND.
A Public Meeting was held in the Strand, on Saturday last, to take
into consideration the state of the chimney of MR. Deville, the lamp-
dealer in general, and phrenologist in particular. The meeting was held
on the foot-pavement, immediately in front of the house, and was attended
by the street-keeper, who wore the gold leather insignia of the order of the
collar and hat-band, supported by the sweep, who carried in his hands the
wands and brushes of the fraternity of Ramoneurs, the turncock, in
the glazed hat of the brotherhood of the Grand Junction, together with the
firemen, and several boys, whose names we were unable to catch, but who
were, no doubt, highly influential in collecting the crowd that assembled.
The street-keeper opened the proceedings by briefly knocking at the
shop-door, and demanding the usual reward for bringing the engines, a
motion which was seconded in a neat speech by the officer in command of
the County.
After a few observations from the sweep on the inconvenience of
Ramoneurs, and a constitutional allusion to the old climbing-boy insti-
tutions of the country, the street-keeper appealed very powerfully to the
boys, as to the fact of sparks having been seen to issue from the chimney,
an appeal that was responded to with great warmth by his auditors. The
turncock now begged to make a few observations. He had been there to
turn the water on, and though it was not wanted, he thought he deserved
a portion of the reward; but upon a motion of the firemen, seconded by
tle sweep, the proposition was negatived.
tre BENEFIT of clergy.
No answer having been returned from the house, the following resolu-
tions were put and carried :—it was moved by the fireman and seconded
by the sweep, that if they had not come to the spot the premises would
have gone to blazes; and in future they might go to blazes, unless the
reward was paid. It was moved by the street-keeper and seconded by
the sweep, that the pretensions of the Ramoneur are superior to those of
the key of the plug-hole, and that the turncock be requested to withdraw.
It was moved by the Ramoneur and seconded by the fireman, that the
turncock, by refusing to withdraw, has forfeited the confidence of this
meeting. Something else was about to be moved, when a policeman came
by, and ordered all the party to move on, when the meeting separated.

How fondly-believed what you said
Then, alas ! how completely you sold me,
With blandishments artful and vain ;
When you emptied your snuff-box, and told me
You never would fill it again
Those fumes, so oppressive, from puffing,
Say, what is the solace that flows :
And whence the enjoyment of stuffing
A parcel of dust in your nose
By the habits you thus are pursuing
There can be no pleasure conferr'd ;
How irrational, then, is so doing !
Now is it not very absurd 2
Cigars come to three-pence each, nearly,
And sixpence an ounce is your snuff;

The wealth in your snuff-box you sink,
Would procure me of dresses no end, love,
And keep me in gloves; only think 1
What's worse, for your person I tremble,

THE NEW POLICE HAT.
This ingenious invention bids fair to rival the celebrated Albert Hat
in popularity. The moment His Royal HighNess of Gotha became
acquainted with the fact that the Police were to wear a ventilating hat,
he declared his gracious intention to devote his head to it, for the purpose
of suggesting further improvements. The Prince at length succeeded in
concocting the very elaborate head-gear, of which our engraving fur-
nishes a fac-simile. The original design was very meagre, consisting
of the insertion of a common ventilator in the front of an ordinary
hat; but the sagacity of the Prince immediately saw that the ventilator
could not be always kept going without the aid of a windmill, which
was consequently added. In order, however, to counterbalance the
weight of the windmill, it was thought desirable to add something to the
other side of the hat; and the Prince, after much patient reflection, at
length hit upon a weathercock, because the duty of a policeman is to know
what is in the wind—a knowledge he is sure to acquire with such aids
as a ventilator, a windmill, and a weathercock. It is also evident that the
hat, as altered by his Royal Highness, must keep the police constantly
alive to any breeze that may be springing up ; and the points of the
compass being indicated on the weathercock, will enable them to steer
their course in the right direction.
MUSIC AND THE MILL.
We understand that an entirely new description of Treadmill is about to
be introduced into the Model Prisons. The existing Treadmills are unpro-
ductive; it having been considered inexpedient to render penal labour an
interference with honest industry. Now, it has been agreed, the Treadmill,
if it ground nothing else, might as well grind music ; and accordingly, it
has been proposed to connect the Mill with a large musical instrument of
the nature of the street-organ, but, on a grand scale ; in fact, with a
species of Apollonicon. Music, we know, has charms of a motive influ-
ence on the savage breast ; and no doubt the savage breasts of the poacher,
the housebreaker, and the footpad, might be influenced beneficially by
music. On this account, we hear, the tunes ground will be principally of
a serious character; to which the only objection is, that being for the most
part slow, they would hardly give the convicts work enough. But, then,
on the other hand, the fellows might be employed on Sundays. However,
by way of a boon to the Million, in the shape of music which they could
hear in no other way, the Mill, on certain week-days, will work Lanner's,
Strauss's, and Labitzsky's Waltzes, and the principal popular airs of the
day; except when these, like “Nix my dolly, pals,” or, “Jolly Nose,”
chance to be inappropriate.
We have not heard the new instrument ; but we are told that its per-
formance of the Rogue's March is something quite wonderful.

LORD BROUGHAM AND THE CHIEF BARONSHIP.
LoRD BRough AM every one pointed,
directly it was known that the above
judicial dignity was vacant, as one of
the most eager, if not the most suc-
cessful of candidates. The activity
of his friends may be judged of by
the following testimonials, that were
immediately sent in to the Trea-
sury :—
Testimonial No. 1, F.Row EARL GREY
The bearer, HENRY BRough AM, was in
my service a short time. I found him a very useful person while he
remained with me, but he was unsteady, and always wishing to better
himself. Having been out of place a long time, I think he will be found
to have got over this defect. At all events, I would suggest that there
could be no harm in trying him.
(Signed) GREY.
Testimonial No. 2, FRom the Duke of WELLINGton.
My dear Peel,-I think you know BRough AM almost as well as myself.
I think something ought to be done for him, for he has really shown him-
self a very useful fellow for our purposes. It is true that the Chief
Baronship of the Exchequer requires a cool head, a temperate manner,
and a few other things which our friend is not remarkable for ; but
PARKE is a steady hand to have at his side, and will keep him from going
very far wrong.
My only objection to BRough AM is, that I'm afraid public opinion would
pronounce us “too bad" for giving him the appointment, for it is already
said that it is rather “too good” of BRough AM to ask for it.
If the Privy Council business is not quite off, perhaps it would be
better to let him have his own office of his own creation ; for it is so
difficult to find out what he really wants, that perhaps his own bill will
be the best guide to his wishes. However, do what you think best, and
believe me, Always yours,
WELLINGTON.
Testimonial No. 3, FROM LoRD Lyndhurst.
My dear PEEL,~For Heaven's sake, give BRough AM the Chief Baron-
ship if you can. I find him such a bore on the woolsack, that I shall lose
all patience with him, and say something that will make an enemy of him.
Yours in haste,
LYNDHURST.
TESTIMonial No. 4, FRoM Louis PHILIPPE.
I know HENRY BRough AM, and think he would be a very good judge
if he accepted the Chief Baronship of the Exchequer.
Louis PHILIPPE.
TEstimonial No. 5, FRoM Lond MELBourne.
HENRY BRough AM is, in my opinion, a very fit person to be appointed
Chief Baron, for he is always sure to look at both sides, and adhere to
that which can give him the best and weightiest reasons for doing so.
(Signed) MELBouhne.
Testimonial No. 6, FROM BARoN NATHAN.
MR. BARoN NATHAN presents his compliments to SIR Robert PEEL,
and feeling that he, BARON NATHAN, is likely to clash with the pretensions
of another Baron, begs leave to resign, in favour of BARON BRough AM
AND WAUx, all claims to the Chief Baronship of the Exchequer.
MR. BARON NATHAN is sure that his brother, BARoN BRough AM, can
have no other competitor that can at all be put in comparison with him
but BARoN NATHAN, who flatters himself, therefore, that by thus resigning,
he at once settles the question.

A very ingenious money-box has been sent to us for inspection. The
clever contriver has, in its formation, very minutely studied the moral
and anatomical beauties of MR. ALDERMAN Gibbs. Thus, you have only to
drop the coin into the box, and no power (not eyen that of Chancery) can
get it back again. It is called the “Family Gibbs.”

*THE CUCKoo's NEST ; ºr
on, The BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSTITUTE.
MR. Silk Buckingham, (surnamed the Cuckoo), must certainly
be a descendant of that Duke of Buckingham who was always
bothering Richard III. on the subject of certain “moveables,”
which he, BuckINGHAM, had set his heart upon.
The British and Foreign Institute was originated to unite the
advantages of a private house and a club ; the private house being
for the benefit of Buckingham, and the club arrangements, such as
they are, being for the accommodation of all the members.
The ordinary clubs comprehend—
1. A coffee-room.
2. A dining-room.
A drawing-room.
. A billiard-room.
. A smoking-room.
. A library or reading-room.
. A strangers' room.
. Dressing-rooms.
i
Now the British and Foreign Institute, or rather the British and
Foreign Destitute, comprises two out of these eight apartments;
one of which, the library or reading-room, is devoted to members,
while the other, the drawing-room, is thrown open once a week for
Silk to bore the members to death about the Holy Land.
It may be urged that a coffee-room is not wanted, because, as there
is no coffee, a mere coffee-room would partake of the lucus a non
lucendo principle. The rose by any other name would smell as sweet,
and the coffee at any other house in the neighbourhood would be as
acceptable. Certain it is that “Coffee me no Coffees” is practically
the motto of Bucki NGHAM.
We now come to the dining-room, or rather we can’t come to it,
because there is none. A dining-room without a dinner would be
almost as miserable as a mountebank without a victim; and that
would never suit Bucking H.A.M.
The drawing-rooms, as we have already said, are open to the
Subscribers—once a week—when members are afforded an oppor-
tunity of comparing the living Bucking HAM with his portrait (in oil
and a turban,) which is exhibited on the walls, surrounded by the
young B.'s, who if they resemble the elder “busy busy B,” will, of
course, know how “to improve the shining hour.”
As to a billiard-room, or a smoking-room, who can require such
apartments in such a place BuckinghAM himself being “an im-
mense cigar,” if smoking were allowed, he would inevitably be
smoked, and there would be an end of the Cuckoo's Nest.
It is, perhaps, rather an inconvenience to members to feel them-
selves in the position of trespassers on the premises in George-street;
but, yet, how delicate are the precautions taken by Mr. BuckINGHAM
to prevent them from intruding where they have no right, and thus
feeling themselves de trop in the British and Foreign Destitute. On
nearly every door there is a brass plate, for JAMEs Silk can
appreciate the value of brass—inscribed with the words, “Private—
MR. Buckinghaxi :" words that are sufficient to act as repellants at
once, and thus the subscriber involuntarily turns aside from the
room he has no business in. The reading-room, it is true, is very
narrow—but, as no one who has been there once wishes to go again, it
may be pronounced to be “as broad as it is long,” and Bucking HAM
is sure to allow himself, if not his subscribers, plenty of latitude.

The plans of the second and third floors may be greatly simplified,

The absence of dressing-rooms has been remarked upon ; but any
member, having a previous understanding with the housemaid, may
take his turn at the jack-towel.
It has been objected that the absence of anything to eat detracts
from the advantages of the Destitute ; but to obviate this, the next
door has been turned into a restaurant, combining the simple fare
of the humblest eating-house with the prices of the Athenaeum.
This cook's shop is reached by a dilapidation of the party-wall,
through a hole in which the members are let in at all hours.
By way of rendering the British and Foreign Destitute particularly
select, it is arranged that the annual subscription for the first year
shall be payable twice in the twelvemonth, a luxury which, however
costly, is one that no other club can claim the advantage of.

PUNCH,”S
HE DUKE of WellingtoN, on entering the
House, begged to call the attention of the
few members, present to a copy of PUNch,
which he now held in his hand. The noble
Duke was understood to refer to the illustra-
tion of “THE GIANT AND THE Dw ARF,” and
expressed his deep sense of the compliment
that had been paid to him.
A messenger from the Commons now ap-
peared at the Bar with various Bills from
the Lower House.
LoRD STRAN groRD, in allusion to the
document that the noble Duke (Wellington)
now held in his hand, remarked that it was
really admirable.
LoRD Colchest ER inquired if it was not an excellent ideal
LoRD STRANGroRD replied, Certainly.
The EARL of WINchelsea took the opportunity to observe that
he thought it very good, and he (the EARL or Winchelsea) might
add, very like also. (A laugh.)
Load Colchest ER would ask the noble Duke to place in his
(Lond Colchest ER's) hands a portion of the paper which the noble
Duke now held in his possession. He (Loan Colchest ER) was
always glad to take a leaf out of the Duke of Wellington's book.
The Duke of WELLIN arox was unwilling to consent to a
discussion. Besides there was other business now before their
Lordships.
All the Bills having been forwarded a stage, the House adjourned.
CA Binet news,
GENERAL Tom Thumb has been so often sent for to the Palace, that a
speedy change in the Cabinet is looked upon as inevitable. It is ruinoured
that the General has already written to Lord Brougham.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Çmclogurt of ØØHagte £amūg 33 (II.
A DoNKEY’s PETITION To THE House of commons.
% AY IT PLEASE
Your HoNoun-
ABLE House,
our Peti-
tioner as a
born Donkey,
approaches you
with a pecu-
liar confidence,
knowing the in-
dulgence with
which you are
sometimes prone
to listen to the words of his fellows.
It would be the basest ingratitude
in him not to feel a lively faith in
your consideration, seeing with what
tenderness, with what tolerance,
the tribe of asses is frequently
treated by your honourable body.
Indeed, how much of the history of
Parliament is no other than the
indirect history of the ass
How frequently, too, do many
illustrious members of your House,
despairing of rising to any sublimer
height of eloquence, content them-
selves with imitating “the sweet
voices of my fellows”—how many,
not born to speak upon any ques-
tion, can, nevertheless, (occasion
serving) bray upon all !
Hence am I, a donkey, embold-
ened to approach your Honourable
House, feeling that I already possess
within it many sympathising friends,
admirers and advocates; whose whole
lives have, indeed, been so closely
associated with my interests, that
their names and my own have been pronounced as one. Indeed,
and indeed, how often have M.P. and A.S.S. met in the same indi-
vidual
It having, therefore, been made known to me by an intimate
friend from among your body, that a Bill is now before your Honour-
able House for the purpose of legalising the Enclosure of Commons
and Waste Lands, and thereby depriving poor men's asses, cows,
geese, fowls, &c., of their born rights, your Petitioner, with most
respectful humility, prays that you will again and again consider the
true object of such measure, ere you shall give to it the mischief of
a law.
The rights of property Consider, gentlemen, the solemnity of
these words—digest the awful meaning of the syllables. Does not
your Honourable House, in its deep devotion to the words, transport
forgers, burglars, pickpockets Does it not read them even in a
cotton pocket-handkerchief, value fourpence 1 Indeed, is there any-
thing beneath the sky, that is not, by the philosophy of Parliament
dignified, made sacred by the syllables?
Do not landlords' hares run about with “rights of property” marked
in their skins Are not the syllables among the golden plumage of
the pheasant Lurk they not in the sober feathers of the partridge
Grow they not in every piece of turf–on every hedge And if,
indeed, “Rights of Property” is not to be read in the eternal sun,
moon, and stars, it is only because, unfortunately, an Act of Parlia-
ment will not reach them 1
Then is it by the devotion, the religion of your Honourable House
to “Rights of Property” that your Petitioner conjures you to respect
them when vested in the poor man. The common is his birthright;
it is one of the few spots of this planet left by the shamefaced human-
ity of grudging wealth to the poor. “The Rights of Property " May
it please your Honourable House, for a brief breathing-time, to give
ear to, ponder upon, and take to heart the “Rights of Porerty?”
Very many of your Honourable House were born heirs to lands.
Thousands of acres acknowledged ye, at your first baby wail, their
lords and masters. “Rights of Property,” in a golden halo, shone
around your cradles And far about and loud was the rejoicing at
the birth of the young heir. Ale-casks foamed, whole oxen roasted
at the fire—the flesh-pots were set before all comers—and the whole
neighbourhood made merry at the glad advent of the lucky babe, for
whom corn-fields waved their golden treasures—to whom ten thou-
sand oaks bowed homage ' Nay, the domestic animals—so old wives
have declared—showed strange sympathy with the human happiness
around them. The turnspit at the fire did its duty, as it were a
labour of love—the peacock on the lawn screamed a note of
triumph, and showed the glory of its tail with new delight. And all
these doings, sounds and sights of merriment, were the proper, the
customary homage to the “Rights of Property.”
Your petitioner's master was born when your petitioner was a
rough, happy, milk-sucking foal. He was the sixth child of Robin
HEDGEstake, farm-servant and day-labourer, who dwelt in a small
cot on the edge of Gaggle Common. Robin had a bit of garden-
ground, which, at over-hours, he cultivated, growing therein most
miraculous cabbages. Besides his garden, RoRIN had his right of
Common ; and partook sufficingly of that right in the persons of my
mother and myself, five geese and a gander, and I forget the number
of cocks and hens. It was a fine thing to see Robin sometimes stroll
upon the Common, treading the soil with the happy air of a pro-
prietor. He had at least one bit of land from out the whole earth ;
he, himself, was born to his piece of turf–he had his right—the
“Rights of Property,” as inalienably his, as the land won or stolen
at the Conquest was the right of the squire. Robin might gaze
with allowed complacency at his geese, fattening upon his land—his
she-ass and foal cropping his grass. If he was not a lord of the soil,
he was at least the owner of a patch of Common And his last baby,
too, the sixth—he, too, was born a landholder, and would have his ass,
his geese, his fowls, picking their scanty food from the same earth
that had helped to feed their progenitors, who shall say how many
generations upwards.
Your petitioner has heard with dismay that it is the purpose and
intention of your Honourable House to deprive all present and future
peasantry of the rights enjoyed by such as Robin HEDGEstAKE. Your
petitioner cannot, however, give full credence to this rumour, know-
ing the intense devotion of your Honourable House to the “Rights
of Property;” knowing, that in defence of such rights you have
hanged tens of thousands; and, at the present time, have in New
South Wales, at the Bermudas, and on board of English hulks, other
thousands of living felons, witnesses of your devotion to the high
principle. Is it likely that your Honourable House, that hangs and
transports the poor thief, would, in its turn, filch from the pauper ?
Your petitioner, even as a donkey, cannot believe it.
Had Rob IN HEDGEst AKE driven my mother and myself into the
pastures of the landholder, certain it is, the same Robin would have
been put in the stocks—my dear mother and myself clapt in the
pound—and heaven, or at least the parish attorney, only knows
what further punishment might have been wreaked upon the evil-
doer And is it possible that the aforesaid landholder sha'l be per-
mitted, under any plea, to enclose the poor man's common—to
deprive his goose, his fowls, his ass, of their very birthright : Shall
the poor man have no piece of earth that he can call his own Barred
as he is from the enjoyments of the rich, caged as he is by a hundred
necessities, shall he not—even like a prisoned lark—have one bit of
turf, whereon he may give blithe utterance to his spirit Shall the
“Rights of Property” be a carol only for the rich, sung to the chink
of money-bags
RoBIN HEDGESTAKE was an honest, worthy soul—his smock-
frock to him as honourable as the fine Saxony of his landlord,
Member for the County. Yet, allow your petitioner to suppose a
case. Permit him for a moment to picture Rob IN HEDGEstARE
as a thief. Yes; Robin has broken into his landlord's stable, and
defrauded his hunters of their hay and oats. Robin’s ass and
poultry have devoured the stolen goods. In the good old hempen
days, certain it is that Robin would have suffered asphyxia for the
felony—in common sessions phrase, he would have been hanged by
the neck until he was dead. In these better times, Robin would be
transported: he would be a doomed felon, for seven, fourteen years,
or for life, according to the bile and the fine sense of “the Rights
of Property” of the judge who tried him. And serve Rob IN right,
cry the laws; wherefore should he, the varlet, steal hay and oats
And may your petitioner ask of your Honourable House, where-
fore should you steal the poor man's pasture ? Wherefore should you
defraud his geese and poultry of their few and hard-gained pickings
Why rob his ass of a few mouthfuls of short, hard grass—why rob
him of his pungent thistle ; Your Honourable House will not do

this, simply because you have the power to do so. It is the wickedest
work of man when he hammers might into right: it is—take your
Petitioner's and a donkey's word for it—unsafe work, too : for
though it may seem to hold for a time, some day it is apt to snap, to
the doing of much mischief to those who hammered it.
Wherefore, your Petitioner hopes your Honourable House will
pause and ponder on the Enclosure of Waste Lands and Commons
Bill, now before you, and (provided that you legislate for the com-
bined Rights of Property and Poverty too)—
Your Petitioner will ever bray,
A Donkey.
IMPORTANT.--TO THE LADIES.
The great success which the “Strong Wind” has met with in the
lottery of wedlock, has induced his companions in arms and paint—the
Ojibbeway Indians—to advertise for English wives; and as the said Indians
are very shortly about to leave the country, early applications on the part
of the ladies are desirable. The Indians have already at least one wife, but
they promise, even as “Strong Wind” promised, to remain constant
to their new helpmates; a promise which, upon their return to the back
woods, they will doubtless most honourably perform. We subjoin the
advertisements:—

The Boy Chief, in his ad-
miration of the martial
character of England,
will have no objection
to the widow of a gene-
ral officer, if under
forty. Her property
must not be secured

must know how to cure

rake, and dig, and reap.
She must also be able
to skin rabbits and

“PA-TAN-Na-quet-a-wer-be-the Driving Cloud. The advertiser is the
War Chief, aged 51, of a remarkably placable and humorous disposition.
He has no objection to treat with a young English lady; and will on a
marriage settlement, secure to her all his scalps. The young lady must
have been tenderly and affectionately brought up, as she will have to carry
the wigwam poles of the Driving Cloud upon all journeys. She must
bring a sufficient income to keep her husband in tobacco, rum, and laziness.
English securities preferred: no holder of Pennsylvanian bonds will be
treated with.
No. III.
“WE-Nish-ka-wea-BE—Fly Gull and Hereditary Chief, is open to the
offers of the Ladies of England. Having inherited his dignity, not won it
by any deeds or virtues of his own, advertisers are confidently referred to
the Ojibbeway Peerage, 4to. The birth of the Flying Gull will not allow
him to treat with anybody below a baronet's daughter.”
Gish-E-Gosh-e-Ghee, the Moonlight Night, and SAH-MA, Tobacco, in the
most unblushing manner, also forwarded their advertisements; but as
Punch discovered them to be both married men, with their wives here
with them, he, with his known devotion to the proprieties, has of course
refused to insert any such invitations to the connubial state.

Funch's Picture Gallery.
In order to keep pace with some of our contemporaries, we purpose pre-
senting all our subscribers on an early day with a magnificent representa-
tion of the City Fast, as a companion to the well-known picture of the
Waterloo Banquet. The City Fast will consist of a single plate, with
nothing on it. Proofs may be seen at the Mansion House during the
whole of the present Mayoralty.
PHYSICIANS AND GENERAL PRACTITIONERS.
A controversy has been raised of late on the respective merits of the
Physician and the General Practitioner. Punch will endeavour to
settle it.
The Physician writes M.D. after his name.
M.R.C.S.
The General Practitioner might also subjoin L.A.C. to his name, if he
chose, for Licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company; but he usually
waves this privilege.
Now hence, upon the long-established axiom that two and two make
four, it is clear that the General Practitioner is a man of more letters
than the Physician. The latter, notwithstanding, piques himself on his
superior education, having generally been to Oxford or Cambridge, and
there taken his degree. At the University, he is supposed to have ac-
quired a familiarity with the dead languages, the importance whereof, in
the cure of diseases, must be obvious.
The Physician's range of business is narrower. He takes a parti-
cular class of diseases, called “medical;” otherwise they are termed
“internal;” the human body having been determined by the Faculty to
have an inside and an outside, just like an omnibus, the laws of Nature
with respect to each being different. Further, in the ailments which the
Physician attends to there is a something which renders their treatment
a more elevated, ennobling, gentlemanlike, and aristocratic occupation
than that of others. A stomach-ache, for instance, is the province of the
Physician ; a broken shin that of the General Practitioner.
The Physician almost invariably dresses in black, and wears a white
neckcloth. He also often affects smalls and gaiters; likewise, short frills.
He appears, no doubt very properly, to be in perpetual mourning. The
General Practitioner more frequently sports coloured clothes, as drab
trousers and a figured waistcoat. With respect to features, the Roman
nose, we think, is more characteristic of Physicians; while among General
Practitioners, we should say the more common of the two was the snub.
The General Practitioner
“when Doctors disagree,” etc. etc.
The General Practitioner and Physician often meet professionally; on
which occasions their interests, as well as their opinions, are very apt to
clash: whereupon an altercation ensues, which ends by the Physician's
telling the General Practitioner that he is an “impudent quack,” and the
General Practitioner's replying to the Physician that he is “a contemptibl
humbug.”

The Port of London has long enjoyed a reputation for being “equal to any, and inferior to
none,” as was emphatically observed by Mr. Rowland, in one of his earlier treatises on Macassar.
The genealogy of Gout may be summed up by stating briefly that it is got by port out of bottle-
port being, as the wine-consumer is perhaps aware, frequently got by logwood out of sloe-juice.
CLERICAL INTELLIGENCE.
The East of Lonspale, late Lond Lowrhea, has presented the Rev. Henry Lowrhea to the trustee-
ship of the harbour of Whitehaven. The advantage of having a clergyman to look after the interests of the
harbour, cannot be too highly appreciated; and the reverend incumbent will, no doubt, prepare the sailors
for going aloft in the double meaning of the term. Whitehaven is remarkable for its oysters; the Earl
of Lonsdals is perfectly justified in placing the harbour under the trusteeship of a reverend individual
whose attention to the cure of souls points him out as a fit person to look after the interests of the
natives.
HUNGERFORD st/SPENSION
BRIDGE.
This splendid structure is said to be
nearly completed, though there is nothing
to be seen but a couple of brick but
tresses; one at one end and the other at
the other. How the proprietors intend
to make both ends meet is at present a
mystery. The bridge is designed for
foot passengers only, and it is expected
will be greatly patronised by the market-
gardeners, who will, of course, leave
their horses and carts on the other side
of the river. It is calculated that all
the persons employed at the brewery in
Pedlar's Acre will use the Hungerford
Suspension Bridge at least once a day.
If the draymen occupy apartments at
the west end of the town, it is possible
that in the expected traffic from this
source the shareholders will not be dis-
appointed. It is to be hoped that the
people of Lancaster-place will mix more
than they have done hitherto with the
inhabitants of the York-road ; and thus
Richmond's prediction as to the union
of the houses of York (road) and Lan-
caster (place) will be literally verified.
The white (washed) rows of the one,
and the red (brick) rows of the other,
are emblematical of the white and red
roses which were entwined together on
the field of Bosworth.

having paid nine hundred pounds for
the relationship, becomes a sergeant ac-
cordingly. The sergeant elect then takes
out of his pocket a small paper parcel
containing a coif, which he places on the
top of his head, and gives his old, worn-
out, utter barrister's wig to his clerk, to
be taken back to his chambers. This in-
teresting ceremony went off with consi-
derable éclat on the occasion of SIR
FREDERick Pollock's investiture with
the insignia of sergeancy.

THE GREAT KING OF TROYNOVANT.
He following legend respecting Troynovant, as
London was anciently called, has been extracted,
at a frightful expense, from the Chronicle of
HUKERIUs WALKERIUs.]
The vast city of Troynovant was governed by
a king, whom the natives called the “Meir,” or
“Mare.” His palace, or mansion as it was
termed, was built by a hill famous for its luxu-
riant corn; and the size of the poultry-yard,
which was adjacent to it, attracted the admira-
tion of all beholders. He had another palace
more peculiarly royal, as the street which it
commanded was called the “King's Street.”
This was guarded by two enormous giants, many
hundred years old, who were in the habit of
leaving their posts, and coming to take refresh-
ment, whenever they heard the clock strike one.
This movement of the giants was always anti-
cipated by those who came from distant parts,
with great curiosity, but few were eventually
much gratified by the exhibition. So vast was
the city, and so great was the might of the king,
that the constitution provided that he should
only reign for a single year, taking the same
precaution, against the accumulation of power
in one individual that the Romans did with
November the new king was enthroned, and on
were burned in derision, being called a “Gye.”
There was once a king of Troynovant, whose
reign was marked by a magnificence unequalled
in the memory even of the oldest meu, , The name of this splendid king
was OMFRIUs; and nothing was talked of, in his day, but the abundant feasts
which he gave. All sorts and conditions of men were invited to these
stupendous festivals; and a herald used to blow a trumpet, whenever one
of them took place, and to cry out, “KING OMFRIUs will feast to-day;
welcome, all ye good citizens of Troynovant.”
Now in the days of OMFRIus the beasts and birds had not lost the faculty
of speech, but could converse as wisely and discreetly as those of whom
mention is made by the sage historian AEsop. Seeing their numbers
greatly diminished by the frequent banquets, they held a great council to
determine what course they should pursue. They there admitted that
they were by the destinies so far subjected to man, that he might slaugh-
ter and eat them in moderation, without their having a right to raise a
voice against it. There were, however, limits to the work of consumption,
and these limits had certainly been passed by King OMFRIUs. An occa-
sional festivity they did not mind ; indeed, it served to check a surplus
population ; but this uninterrupted series of feasts threatened absolute
annihilation. The beasts and birds therefore resolved to make war on
Troynovant, and sweep it from the surface of the earth, and they were
joined in their resolution by the fishes, who peeped up from the river, and
expressed their hearty concurrence in the views they had overheard.
The cattle were to rush in a body to the corn hill, and gore to death all
whom they met ; the birds were to swarm in the air so thickly, as to cut
off the light of heaven from the citizens; and the fish were to block up
the Thames, so as to render all escape by water utterly impossible.
However, just as they were about to make preparations for the attack,
a stranger suddenly appeared before them on the part of the city, re-
questing them to desist, as he had terms of peace to propose. The birds,
regard to their consuls. On the 9th of every
the 5th preceding the effigies of the old king
beasts, and fishes paused in anxious curiosity. “Omfrius," said the
stranger, “whose excesses awakened your just indignation, has ceased,
and I am sovereign of Troynovant. Desist from your hostile purpose, and
lo! here I solemnly promise that I and the members of my house will be
satisfied with an occasional mutton chop, and that I will give no feastings
to my voracious subjects.” When the animals heard this º
greatly, and cried with one voice, “Long live the new king of Troynovant
may his reign last for ever ! While he is on the throne we will make no
attack on his ancient city.” So they retired to their several homes. And
the king kept his word, for his reign was distinguished for the great
abstemiousness of the court.
Because the successor of OMFRIUs had thus saved Troynovant, the
citizens in gratitude gave him the name of “Magnus,” which in the
Latin tongue signifies “great.” But, nevertheless, some of the old men
would shake their heads doubtfully and say, “Whatever were the faults
of OMFRIUs, truly his reign was a merry one after all !”
A VOICE FROM THE RIVER,
You take your wife to Putney, when she's ailing,
To reap the benefit of fresher air;
- She thinks of shipwreck, and, her spirits failing,
Most heartily she wishes you were there.
While to her better sense you are appealing,
And doing all you can in vain to please her;
Ah! little dreams that captain of your feeling,
As from the paddle-box he bawls out—“Ease her l’”
CONCILIATION HALL.
[From our own Reporter]
R. O'Connell stated that sympathy was
spreading more and more. Communi-
cations had reached him from the Moon,
and it appeared that meetings are about
to be held in both Horns, as well as in
its other quarters, and that there is not
the shadow of a doubt that large remit-
tances may be expected. Many think
that there will be an aggregate Monster
Meeting in one of the Central Planets,
and that it is not too much to expect that
Delegates from the Georgium Sidus will
attend ; and as the brightness of that luminary exceeds anything, noticed
elsewhere, it is rational to suppose that its surface is composed of pre-
cious metal—a very encouraging idea to Repealers.
MR. O'Connell read a communication from the Secretary of a Repeal
Association in a place situated near the northern horn of the Moon,
inclosing a draught for 100l. He also announced the receipt of 20l. from
a tribe of Esquimaux, Parry's Cove, Hudson's Bay. He begged to con-
clude his remarks by singing a song of his own composing.
THE PATRIOT'S ADDRESS TO HIS COUNTRYMEN.
Our hands shall be freed from the tyrant,
Each hero be rich as the Mint;
What blessings and comforts await ye,
If you will but remember the Rint.
My countrymen l Liberty calls you,
She gives you an Irish broad hint;
Arise and respond to her watchword-
“Be sure and remember the Rint.”
Long time have oppressors enslaved you,
Who never thro’ pity ralint;
But now is the hour of deliv'rance:
Be sure and remember the Rint.
What foe can expect to oppose ye,
Or the growth of your power to stint,
If you only will do what I tell ye,
And be sure to remember the Rint 1
Your tyrants still wish to enthrall you,
Their hearts are as hard as a flint;
You may laugh them to scorn and
despise them,
If you only remember the Rint.
For myself he may send me to prison,
I scorn his ferocious intint,
And I care not a straw for his malice,
If you will but remember the Rint.
My countrymen Victory "waits you—
Bright Fame, in a glorious tint,
Will paint forth your actions in story :
Be sure and remember the Rint.
Your fathers have fought and have
conquered,
Their names are recorded in print:
So eclipse their bold prowess in battle :
Be sure and remember the Rint.
In this glorious cause I have laboured,
For this my best days I have spint,
You cannot now mean to forsake me.
Be sure and remember the Rint.
Oh! son of this great, this green island,
I only just give you a hint,
That I always will stick to my country,
If she will but remember the Rint,
The Association then adjourned.

are indebted to Colonel THIERY, the
Aide-de-Camp, or tutor, or it may possibly
be toady to the Duke of MontpeNSIER.
The letter is to the Queen, on the young
Prince's first affair —
“I am happy to have the honour of
giving to your Majesty some details re-
garding the conduct of H.R.H.. the Duke
of Montpensier, which he could not himself give
but at the ea'pense of his modesty.”
() fie :
“The Prince at length has found an occasion
for showing that he could emulate his brothers in
courage, charged to aid in the attack upon the
village of Mechouneche with his guns. H.R.H.
had to defile under the Arab fire at a very short
distance from their guns; but his batteries were
soon judiciously posted, and there the inauguration of the royal artillery-
man (how pHErry !) took place in the face of the whole army, by a brisk
cannonade, the effects of which contributed greatly to the success of the
first part of the air. The Prince from this position fired his howitzers
and wall-guns, the discharge of which brought sereral Arabs to the ground. |
I considered it as sufficient : but there was still
better fortune in store for the two Princes.
“On another point our attacks had not been so successful. A column
of infantry had met with such difficulties of ground (only pifficulties of
GRouxd, of course.) that it began to falter ; and the audacity of the Arabs
had increased in a menacing manner. The Duke of Aumale thought
proper to put an end to this by moving forward in person at the head of
the grenadiers. The Duke of Montpensier felt that his place was no
longer there, where the perils he was to encounter were less than those
which his brother was facing; and, by an inspiration, of which the merit
belongs entirely to himself, he gave up the command of the guns to the
lieutenants under him, and followed across a shower of balls by the side
of the Duke of Aumale.
“His devotedness was near costing him dear. He was one of the privileged
in the group which followed the Princes. A ball tore the upper eyelid of
his left eye. Although the pain was severe, and the blood which issued
from this slight wound was at first sight alarming, H.R.H. never paused
in his course; but, with his brother, was among the first to reaeh the
height crowned by the Arabs, and considered by them as so impregnable,
that those natives who were not witnesses of the action, INsist on ITs
Being Attested to the M. By oa'ſ H. :
“The Duke of Aumale's resolution was heroic, and success justified his
temerity, although it was great. The Princes were not followed by twenty
soldiers, worn out by fatigue when they reached the crest of the hill
occupied by several HUNDRED of the enemy. Among them were several
regulars, who were at our approach seized with a panic, which was quite
unexpected.

Now, dear Thiery, we have finished that veracious History of the

will be proved when the Revolution shall come to pass), we are prepared

There is nothing of a lickspittle about you—no flattery; every word you
say seems Gospel true.
What, the whole column of infantry began to falter, did they before
Mechouneche, that pretty v lage. And the audacity of the Arabs grew
menacing ! And the Princes rushed forward with twenty men only (what
a compliment to the gallantry of the rest of the army 1), and with these
twenty men upset several hundreds of the enemy, who were seized with
an unaccountable panic l

Dear friend, it must have been at the sight of the young Prince of
Montpensień, with his left upper eyelid bleeding—bon Dieu, what a
ghastly royal artilleryman what a blood-stained young bombardier of a
Prince he must have looked 1
But what was the ball which tore the eyelid, dear Sir—was it a eannon
ball a great whacking, thundering, whizzing, eighty-four pounder ; or
perhaps a bomb that went off and lodged there ; or, perhaps, a Congreve
rocket that whisked off an eyelash—Heavens, what an escape it was.
Explain it to us, dear truthteller, more accurately in your next charming
letter. Let us know how it was that the ball hit the dear PRINCE in the
eyelid, and how it was that his nose got off unhurt, and his forehead ; and
how the wound which bled so terrifically, and was so painful, won't even
leave a scar.
Perhaps the ball respected the PRINCE—was seized with an unaccount-
able panic, like the several hundred regulars, at sight of his Royal High-
ness's face, and bounded back quite astonished. Amiable friend, why
should not this be true 1 Tell us about it in your next, and mention the
name of the Arabs who were killed by the rebound.
Don't say if the ball which touched the eyelid of the Royal Bombar-
ders was only his eyeball:—it is much better as it stands—or let us say at
once that it was a red-hot shot ; you picked it up, cooled it, and intend to
send it as a present to the Queen.
That is a great stroke, dear friend, about the Arabs (who did not witness
the action of the Princes, and their twenty men frightening away the
several hundreds)—forcing You to swear to the FAct before they will
believe it. Will they believe it when you po swear 1 0 those benighted

dear Thieny. We never sneered at a whole army, to exalt the bravery
of two young men. His Royal Highness Prince ALBERT has undergone
some handsome dangers in his time, but he never had his eyelid torn by a
cannon-ball. Be yours the palm—yours, and the country which owns
you. -
Let us hope, dear Sir, that in the approaching visit of the French King
to this country, we may see you following at his august back. If you
come to the Štrand, come, and see us. Come, and we will introduce
you to some similar English worthies.
And we will institute an order, and it shall be called the Order of the

PRINCE ALBERT"S VISIT TO THE HOUSES
OF PARLIAMENT.
(From our own Reporter.)
His Royal Highness, in his capacity of one of the Commissioners of the
Fine Arts, paid a visit on Saturday afternoon to the New Houses of Par-
liament. He was met at the door by MR. BARRY, the architect, and Mr.
GRissell, the builder, to whom His Royal Highness was pleased to remark,
that whenever he met with GRussell, he was sure there was some pleasure
in peto for him. Colonel Bouverie having explained to the bystanders
the fact of MR. GRIssell being in partnership with a gentleman of the name
of Peto, the whole party laughed very heartily.
His Royal Highness, on entering the porch, was told it was built of
free-stone, upon which he emphatically remarked, that the stone ought to
be free, which was used in the construction of the Houses of Parliament
of a free people. LoRD PALMERStoN, who was of the party, added, that no
doubt ShakespeARE, when he asserted that there were sermons in stones,
alluded particularly to “free-stones,” an observation that was not particu-
larly well received by the rest of the company.
During the inspection of the lower part of the Victoria Tower it was
stated to his Royal Highness that the niches in the wall were to be filled
with statues of the Kings and Queens of England, when the PRINCE
expressed considerable anxiety to have some idea of the effect that would
be produced by such an arrangement. After a good deal of joking as to
which of the party would best become the niche, one of the masons was
pounced upon and hoisted into the space amid much merriment, which
was greatly increased by PRINCE ALBERT remarking that as the man was
in his working dress, which was rather black, (it being Saturday,) he
looked more like King Coal than any other sovereign.
It was explained to the PRINCE that the Houses would be ventilated by
a tower, 300 feet high, rising far above the ascent of smoke ; upon which
the PRINCE observed, he did not see why the legislature should not be
made to consume its own smoke, instead of pouring it out in dense
volumes on the metropolis. After having scrambled up and down tem-
porary staircases, and along temporary scaffolds, till a quarter past six,
the whole party quitted the premises, highly delighted at having got safely
out of them.

the boys in their yellow stockings will afford much amusement to the
illustrious prince who will henceforth have to govern the hospital. We
have been given to understand that a blue-coat boy having been seen by
the heir to the throne, during a ride in Windsor Park, was pleased to
exclaim, “Oh, dok dere,” which is the infantine term for “look there ;”
and it was immediately resolved to make the royal infant a governor of
the school—a pupil of which he had so patronisingly condescended to
notice.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE POTATO PANIC.
We cannot sufficiently reprehend the excitement that some timid
or interested parties have been endeavouring to get up on the subject
of this humble, but wholesome esculent. A wild shout has gone
forth from the west of Scotland, that potatoes are scarce. The cry
has been borne along the western islands, bounding over the hills,
and reverberating through the valleys, till it has reached the very
walls of the Metropolis. Happily, the cry has proved to be false;
and the apple of the earth—the pomme which our Gallic neignbours
so expressively describe as deterre-is abundant in the cellars of our
wholesale dealers, the sheds of our retailers, and the smacks, the
sloops, or the brigs of our shippers.
We need hardly impress upon our readers the satisfaction we
experience at finding that the potato panic is an idle vision, that has
vanished into thin—ay, the very thinnest—air. From the time
that Raleigh first landed at the Custom-house with a sack of the
nutritious vegetable, the potato has been a welcome guest at the
British dinner-table. Our fathers have boiled it, and our mothers
have mashed it for ages. Art has done for the potato what nature
alone never could have accomplished. French ingenuity has
smothered the salubrious root in parsley and butter, to render it
worthy of the head of the household—the maitre d'hôtel ; while
British benevolence has baked it for the hungry poor who throng
the streets of the great Metropolis. Is it not natural that we should
feel a flush of satisfaction pervading our bosoms at the thought that
among the other blessings with which this country is surrounded
under its venerable institutions, we have still to number, for the
present year at least, the potato as one.

Until very recently there was no admission except by ticket—
which ticket, on payment of a shilling, was certainly to be
obtained at any of the neighbouring public-houses (the York
and Albany for one), by which a little pleasant tippling was
indirectly encouraged. R. there is no necessity for a ticket;
but upon laying down your shilling, the following queries are
put by the money-taker :-
“Have you no ticket?”
* No.”
“What is your name 1”
* Smith.”
* That will do. Pass on.”
On you go, the money-taker never booking
the name of SMITH-never taking SMITH's
address, in case he should carry off the Brahmin bull or the rhinoceros ;
but merely asking these questions as a sort of coquetry with the dignity
of the society, that, it would seem, does not like at once to come down to
the vulgarity of ready-money. Can you, MR. Punch, tell me and many
others the reason of this?
º º
Yours,
John SMITH.
[We think that John SMITH has himself hit upon the reason ; the dig-
nified dallying of great folks—for there are even bishops among the
fellows—who prefer to do the plainest business in the most round-about
way. Like their own elephant, they cannot even take a shilling without
making a tortuous movement to lay hold of it.—Punch.]
Official Rumours.
It is generally understood in official circles, that the Ministers intend
making a strenuous effort to buy off the opposition of MR. HuME. If the
Honourable economist is placed in a position for which he is adapted by
his peculiar talent, he will be offered the command of a revenue cutter—
for his tact in cutting down the revenue must be, on all hands, admitted.
HINTS TO MAKE HOME HAPPY.
To Hºuse an os.
- EEP up the practice of reading the paper during
the whole of breakfast time; of allowing your-
self to be spoken to half-a-dozen times before
you answer, and then of asking your wife what
it was that she said. Upon her telling you,
make some reply which is nothing to the pur-
pose, as if you were thinking of something
else.
Having been out over night at an evening
party, which your wife was prevented from
going to by indisposition, entertain her the
next morning by a minute description of the
young lady you danced with, descanting on
every point as enthusiastically as possible.
Take frequent opportunities of praising features and personal pecu-
liarities which are as different as possible from your wife's. For instance,
if she has blue eyes, say how you like black; if dark hair, how much
you admire light: if she is tall, remark that you prefer a moderate height;
and if short, be constantly quoting Byron, to the effect that you “hate a
dumpy woman.”
Some wives are very particular about their fenders. Should this be
the case with yours, always use it for your footstool. When fresh drugget
has been laid down on the stairs, particularly if it is a rainy day, inva-
riably forget to scrape your shoes.
Discover, frequently, on a cold raw morning, that the room is close,
and insist on having the windows open. On the other hand, be as often,
during the height of the dog-days, affected with a chilliness, which shall
oblige you to keep them shut.
Very often order dinner punctually at five, and very seldom come home
till a quarter to six. Occasionally, however, return at the appointed hour,
and, not finding things ready, complain that you are never attended to.
If your fish, your joint, or your vegetables, should happen accidentally
to be a little under or over done, never smother your disappointment like
some people, but express it as * as you can, and remain in an ill
humour for the rest of the evening. Be never quite satisfied with what
is set before you ; but, if possible, find some fault with every dish: or if
not, quarrel with the arrangements of the table. If you can find nothing
else to grumble at, think of something that you would have liked better
than what has been got for you, and say so.
Wives occasionally make pies and puddings, with a view to a little
approbation. Never bestow this, on any account; but always say you
wished these things were left to the cook.
Knowing that there is nothing but cold meat in the house, bring home,
every now and then, half-a-dozen men, unexpectedly, to take pot-luck
with you. Your wife will probably sit at table flurried and uncomfort-
able ; in which case, amuse them by joking at her expense.
Should you chance, after dinner, to be affected by a slight drowsiness,
never resist it because your wife wishes to chat with you : do not mind
her, but go quietly to sleep.
When you have an evening party at your house, come home to dress
just as the company is beginning to arrive.
Should you find yourself at eleven o'clock at night among a set of
bachelor friends, and be offered a cigar, always stay and smoke it, and
another after it if you like, and, if you please, another after that; in fact,
as many as you find agreeable ; never troubling yourself for an instant
about keeping your wife and the servants up.
In short, on all occasions consult studiously your own inclinations, and
indulge, without the least restriction, your every whim and caprice; but
never regard your wife's feelings at all; still less make the slightest allow-
ance for any weakness or peculiarity of her character; and your home
will assuredly be as happy as you deserve that it should be.
THE ELECTIONS.
The recent law elevations and changes placed no less than three con-
stituencies under the painful necessity of looking out for new representa-
tives. MR. Thesiger having been ousted from Woodstock, MR. HuMPHREY
instantly wrote to the electors, declaring himself quite equal to Thesigra;
inasmuch as he was of the same profession, though not so distinguished a
member of it; and of the same political opinions, though his political
opinions were not so much known as those of MR. ThesigER, nor of so
much consequence.

ATROCIOUS CRUELTY IN NEWGATE,
THERE is nothing in the whole annals of Newgate barbarity—
no act of atrocity of the Press-yard of by-gone days—more
barbarous, more atrocious, more capriciously wicked in its reckless-
ness of human suffering, than the “painful duty performed by MR.
SHERIFF Musgrove" yesterday week in Newgate prison, under
the especial direction of the Home Minister. Our readers know
the case of MARY FURLEY ; the public heart had sympathised with
the terrible sorrows of that agonised woman ; public feeling had
revolted alike at the verdict of the jury that cast her guilty of
murder, as at the sentence of MR. JUDGE MAUL E—that “ERos-
TATUs of the Temple”—who held out no hope of mercy to the
offender. Nevertheless, no man for a moment believed that the
sentence would be carried into effect. The address of the judge
was considered as only another of the ghastly mockeries acted by
the judicial mummer in ermine, in the name of the law—a needless,
agonising ceremony, but no more.
However, yesterday week, Ma. SHERIFF Musgrove — to the
astonishment and indignation of all men—was ordered to appoint
the day of death.
“He appointed Monday, the 6th of May, at 8 o'clock A M. He after-
wards visited the unhappy woman, in company with the Rev. John Davis,
Ordinary, and MR. Cope, the Governor. The prisoner received the
announcement in the greatest agony of mind, and in a few minutes became
almost insensible from grief.”
What, in four-and-twenty hours, follows 1–
“On Saturday afternoon, about 4 o'clock, the sheriffs received a com-
munication from the Secretary of State for the Home Department, stating
that HER MAJESTY had been pleased to respite the sentence of death passed
at the last assizes of the Central Criminal Court on MARY FuRLEY during
HER MAJESTY's Royal pleasure.”
In the name of outraged humanity, in the name of a most miser-
able woman, scourged to agony and madness by the cruelty of
unmerited ill-fortune,—we ask SIR JAMEs GRAHAM wherefore this
atrocity was committed Is human life held so cheap at the Home-
Office that a culprit is ordered for execution before a full considera-
tion of all the circumstances bearing on the case ? Is it only after
the criminal is thrown into the “greatest agony of mind,” and “be- |
cause several humane gentlemen interest themselves in her behalf,”
that the Home Minister ponders seriously on the subject If there
be aught solemn in the human heart—aught sacred in its woes and
sufferings, the public have a right to demand of SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM what were the circumstances which induced him to order
MARY FURLEY to prepare for death, and then, in less than four-and-
twenty hours, respited her during pleasure ? Had not her case
been sufficiently considered Was the Home Minister ignorant of'
all the complicated woes, the maddening miseries that had urged
the frantic woman to escape with her child from the crushing
calamities around her Did he not know the wretchedness, more
complete in its horror than any laboured tale of fiction, that step by
step had scourged the woman from the workhouse to the river's
brink Was it needful that she should be still further schooled in
misery by the mock visit of the sheriff—was not her heart bruised
enough, poor soul! that it should again be smitten, under the pharisaic
plea of a great moral warning Yesterday the woman is worthy of
death as a murderess–to-day her sentence is respited, and “it is,
expected that she will undergo a very short imprisonment 1” What
a difference is here between the gallows and the Penitentiary And
again we ask, wherefore ?
Was Sir James Graham so much occupied by his own reputation
-menaced as it was by the Member for Knaresborough—was he so
busily employed cleansing the fly-spots from his own white name, cast
upon it by a Fenn AND–that he was not sufficiently acquainted with
the case of MARY FURLEY, and therefore the needless torture of the
sheriff's visit was inflicted Any way, public feeling demands an
explanation; and we trust that, ere this shall appear, some Member
in the Commons will have put Sir JAMEs GRAHAM to his answer.
At present, a heart-broken woman seems to have been unnecessarily
tortured. Unless Sir JAMEs GRAHAM can give a good reason for the
visit of the sheriff and the quick reprieve that followed it, the sword
and balance of Newgate justice will become in the public eye no
other than the knife and scales of a Shylock.
We shall again return to the case of MARY FuRLEY. Poor, broken-
hearted creature I God help her

his being a Queen's Counsel injured no one—for no client was deprived

satisfaction to anybody. (Cheers and laughter.) He therefore came down

MR. Roebuck could not agree to this, because if he promised to do
nothing, it would look as if he had intended to do something. (A laugh.)

ADVERTISING BARRISTERS.
MR. Wilkins, of the Old Bailey Bar, has recently set the example of
advertising in the Times, and we believe we are correct in stating that
the present is the first instance of a Barrister having addressed the public
in the manner alluded to.
MR. Wilkins is a man of very original mind, though there is nothing
very original in doing that which WARREN the blacking-maker, or Row-
LAND, the Macassar oil-merchant, are in the daily practice of. Neverthe-
less, it is something quite new for a counsel to have recourse to the
advertising columns of the Times; and we must give MR. Wilkins the
credit of being the first member of the bar who has openly availed him-
self of an advertisement for purposes connected with his profession.
Some, who are believed to be envious of MR. Wilkins—which is possible,
for envy often arises on the very smallest grounds—have tried to give to
the fact of his advertising an appearance of impropriety. Nothing, how-
ever, could be more absurd. MR. Wilkins has received 400 letters
about a case in which he appeared as counsel; and, as he can't answer
them in writing, what can be more reasonable than to invite the whole
400, and as many more as like to come, to pay him a visit at his chambers
and talk the matter over.
The learned gentleman, in his advertisement, “requests all who can
furnish any information, &c., to call on him as early as possible, at
the Temple.” It is to be hoped that the public, after this polite invitation,
will “please to copy the address.”
The prejudice which has hitherto prevailed among the “gentlemen of
the bar” to prevent them from advertising, is, we presume, now to be con-
sidered as broken through, and the practice of hiding legal lights under
certain bushels—bushels not only of Coke, but of Lyttleton—may be
regarded as abandoned. And why not There is no reason why, of all
|
quacks in the world, legal quacks should be denied the benefit of adver-
tisements. . We suggest a form, for the guidance of any learned friend,
who is bold enough to pursue the track so gallantly chalked out by MR.
Wilkins. It is only the premier pas qui coute, and the ice of etiquette
once broken, the briefless barristers may plunge headlong into all the
depths of “Alarming Sacrifice,” “ F.F. “Dreadful State
of the Brief Market,” and “Horrible Depression amongst the Gentlemen
of the Long Robe.” The following may be found useful to counsel
desirous of increasing their connection:—
PANIC in WestMINSTER HALL.—The extreme competition in the legal
world has determined Mr. TIMkINs, of the Common Law Bar, to take
briefs at a greatly reduced scale of charges. Computes usually charged
10s. 6d, with an extra guinea for making the rules absolute, will in future be |
taken by Mr. Timkins for one pound, and other motions will be low in pro-
portion: . A strong mandamus, equal to Follett in style and workmanship
—for thirty shillings; and Mr. TIMRINs calls particular attention to his
well-known guinea bill cases, one guinea being all that he asks for any
case on a bill of exchange, whatever the amount or however great the
number of witnesses. Declarations in debt always ready; pleadings
accurately made up, and a large assortment of demurrers always on
hand, with the prices marked upon them according to length, but none
exceeding fifty shillings...MR. Timkins, preferring to attend personally
to the interests of his client, keeps no clerk, and the half-crown is there-
fore never charged upon any brief of any description. An agent of
MR. Timkins attends at the door of the court in which MR. Timkins
may happen to be, and MR. T. allows a handsome commission to occa-
sional touters.

This was a case of Turtle, in which the parties were Mock and
Real. It came on for argument at the Mansion-house Sittings after
Easter, at the dinner given by Magnay (Mayor) to the Judges.
The facts of the case were briefly these–
Punch, as Counsel for the Public, had obtained a rule calling on
Magsay to show cause why he did not give a dinner, when Magnay
not appearing, the rule was made absolute. Magnay being thus in
contempt, endeavoured to purge himself from the contempt by giving
what he termed a dinner to the Judges, on the occasion of the
Queen's Birthday. Another question then arose, as to whether the
Turtle was real or mock, and the point was reserved for the opinion
of all the Judges.
DENMAN (C. J.), now delivered the judgment of their Lordships,
in the following words:—
“This is a case of a decided damnum, but I don't know whether we
can call it a damnum abºgue injurié. My learned brother Aldeason
has reminded me that the soup which is now in discussion was a
molum in *-for it was bad in itself—but it was not a malum prohibitum
—though it really should have been. There is a case in the books,
where a customer having gone into a soup-house, and having some
to pen and ink—
inferior soup given him, threw it in the landlord's face.—Shower. I
don’t know whether we can go the whole length of that case, but I
am sure that the boy who did such a thing could not be blamed, for
it would come under Chitty's Practice. On the whole, I think this
soup ought to be discharged—with costs.”
ALDERson, B.-" I am of the same opinion. Here is a decoction
which is merely colourable; and it is a settled rule, that colour alone
does not constitute a good title. If this soup had appeared on the
record to be mock, the question of its being real could not have been
raised. It is true that there was no application to amend, and if
there had been, I hardly see how it could have been attended to.
The soup must be discharged.”
WILLIAMs, J.-"This is a very bad case indeed ; and it savours of
covin. My brother ALDERson laid some stress upon colour; but I
cannot see how colour bears on the present point. Colour must not
be thrust down, the throats of the Court; and I, for one, will never
consent to it. The soup cannot stand.”
PATTEson, J.-"I, at first, had some doubts on this case; but I had
then only skimmed it. Since I have gone into it, I am quite satisfied
on the subject. The soup is defective in title. It stands on the
record as simply turtle ; but it should have been described as mock,
because the delusive nature of the thing is evident. We must dis-
charge it, and, as my brother DENMAN has stated, with costs.”
The other judges having given their opinions seriatim to the same
effect, the Court rose.

LETTERs, “thick as the leaves of Wallambrosa,” come upon us, de-
manding the whereabout of JENkins Some of the writers—we forgive
the slander—boldly aver that we, Punch, have killed, murdered outright,
the said JENKINs. We loved him too much ; too deeply were we indebted
to him to slay the flunky; no, the man was serviceable to us. Never-
theless, we ourselves have been puzzled to know what has become of
JENKINs. Again and again, since the opera opened, have we looked in the
| Post, but Jenkins was no longer there. No, his flourishes are gone—his
fine, subtle, very long ear for music is not to be seen. We no longer roar
over the criticisms of the opera; once they were fine and volant as dragon-
flies, and now are they flat as flat-fish. Jenkins is departed
However, not to leave the reader in despair—no longer to torture him,
we state, for his comfort, that we have found Jenkins. But how !
Quantum mutatus—as JENkins himself would say. Let us narrate our
adventure.
On Saturday last we attended the opera. Coming out, we looked around
in the hope of espying JENkins. A linkman—with the fine sense be-
longing to “his

The Necessity of Duelling.
To the Editor or “punch.”
HAPPEN lately, Sir, to have seen one or two numbers of your
paper, which, I am sorry to find, is taken in by some who
ought to know better. You have thought proper, I perceive,
to make various ridiculous lemarks upon the subject of duel-
ling, which it is not possible that you should know anything
about ; and by these, and by a series of impertinent carica-
tures, you have been striving to bring it into contempt.
I desire, Sir, that you will desist, for the future, from the
absurd observations above alluded to, and turn your dis-
respectful pencil to some other purpose.
In the first place, let me request you to take notice that
your object is perfectly understood. , You wish to deprive
the aristocracy of a privilege which they have enjoyed from
time immemorial, and thus to efface one of the chief dis-
tinctions which separate them from shoemakers, tinkers,
tailors, low writers, and that sort of people If you expect to succeed, I
assure you you are very much mistaken. . Gentlemen, I can tell you, are
not going to be laughed out of their principles and opinions by you,
| Duelling does not concern the common people. A duel is an affair of
honour; and trades-persons, workmen, and so forth, have no honour to
defend. It is of no consequence to them whether they are insulted or
not ; and if they have disputes, these may be easily settled by their fists,
or by going to law. Among them, therefore, duelling is unnecessary, and
recourse to it would be a presumptuous imitation of their superiors; on
which account, so far as they are concerned, it unquestionably ought not
to be suffered.
Honour is that quality in one gentleman which deters another from
daring to breathe a syllable against his character; and which, conse-
quently, keeps that character unsullied. Honour, then, you will º is
ferocity. Do not be impertinent, Sir. It is proper that you should be
made aware that the preservation of an unsullied character is incumbent
upon every gentleman.
The imputation of falsehood or dishonesty to a gentleman always
renders it imperative that he should send a challenge. I imagine I hear
you ask º a refutation of the charge would not do as well ? None
of your vulgar sneering, Sir—No, it would not do as well. The gentle:
man owes it, as a duty, to the society to which he belongs, to go out and
fight. In so doing, he asserts the principle that no gentleman can become
the accuser of another, but at the risk of being shot. Whatever one
gentleman may think of another, the institution of duelling tends to make
him keep his thoughts to himself. In this manner are often prevented
those painful exposures, which, when allowed to take place, are so highly
prejudicial to the exclusive circles, and the general reputation of the
world of Fashion is upheld. Again, I suppose you will have the audacity
to demand whether the number of blacklegs, swindlers, seducers, and
asserters of untruths, included in the Army and Navy and the ranks of
the aristocracy in general, is really so alarmingly great as to render the
protection of the duelling system indispensable to the existence of that
august body. I will tell you what, Sir ; your plebeian insolence deserves
a severe chastisement, and I have only to add that you may consider
yourself horsewhipped by Your bumble servant,
Horse Guards. Sabrerash.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BUDGET-MONDAY.
ON the motion of the CHANcellor of the ExchequER the House
resolved itself into a committee on ways and means, and MR.
GREENE, selected probably on account of his name, was voted into
the chair.
The CHANcellor of the Exchequen then rose and said, “In
bringing forward the present motion, MR. GREENE, I am anxious to
explain how the country stands, or rather how it is going on. The
last year I thought there was a deficiency, I ventured to hope much
from industry, and I am happy to say that such has been the industry
of the tax-gatherers, that we have a surplus instead of a deficiency.
I am glad to say that there has been an increase upon the customs,
which have been augmented by an unexpected consumption of corn,
tea, and sugar. In my last calculation, I took forty millions of cups
of tea, and allowing two lumps of sugar to each cup, which is above
the average, but I speak in round numbers—the duty would have
been so much ; but as I did not calculate that those cups might|
some of them be breakfast-cups instead of tea-cups, the surplus,
on these articles is very naturally accounted for. (Hear.) With
regard to the Post Office, I can only speak in round numbers,
for I have not yet received all the returns. The Hounslow Mail
of to-night must be added to the receipts in this department,
in which I am glad to announce a decided improvement. (Cheers.)
But while I have undercalculated the income, I must confess
that I have also undercalculated the expenditure, which is more
than I thought; and I will thus explain my error. (Hear, hear.)
The Indian Government and the state of matters in the East, added
to the decrease in particular items, and the falling off in special
sources of revenue, have altogether acted in the fiscal condition of
this country so as to make an excess of outlay. I hope the House
sees what I mean ; and as there is a surplus on the whole, I think it
would be very hard to call on me to explain the minutiae on which a
deficiency has arisen. (Cheers.) I have had letters calling on me
to take the taxes off everything; but as I cannot do this, I think
the better way to deal with the surplus is, to pocket nearly the
whole of it. (Hear.) Let us hope for a continuance of this excess of
revenue over expenditure, and we are sure that this declaration will
be satisfactory to a great, a free, a generous, and an enlightened
people. (Loud cheers.) Some reductions may, however, be made, and
the first article I propose to deal with is glass, which must be delicately
touched, lest we should cut our fingers. (Hear.) The vast distinction
between flint glass and bottle glass seems to be a remnant of that
aristocratic feeling which is fast fading away, and I am anxious to
place the bottle on the same footing as the decanter, though I know
there may be some opposition to the project, particularly in the upper
House of Parliament. (Hear, and cries of CARDIGAN.) I propose,
therefore, to equalize bottles and decanters, and though I cannot
offer the poor man a cheap glass of wine, I can give him a cheap
wine-glass. (Hear.) From wine we naturally come to vinegar—and
in dealing with vinegar, I beg that the learned member for Bath will
favour me with his attention. (Hear, from MR. Roebuck.) I propose
to repeal the entire duty on that delicious acid; so that the salads of
the poor may henceforth enjoy that dressing which high duties had
hitherto denied to them. (Cheers.) I propose, in the next place, to
deal with marine insurances, which will be reduced as a boon to the
people, who, being interested in the maintenance of the grand
principle that Britannia rules the waves, will, I am sure, regard
as a blessing any reduction which enables the shipowner to keep
up, cheaply, the great allegory alluded to. (Loud cheers.) The next
reduction I propose is in currants. I am sure the House will agree
with me, that the roast-beef of Old England is one of her bulwarks;
and, perhaps, after the roast-beef, comes the plum-pudding. (Hear.)
Currants, I need not inform the House, are of vital importance to
the latter, and if I can give the people of England a clean and
cheap currant, at four-and-a-half, for which they have hitherto been
paying seven, I am sure that at the festive period of º
blessings—mixed with currants—will be in the mouth of all who
experience the boon that is offered them. (Hear.) There is only one
more article I propose to deal with, and that is wool, the duty on
which will be altogether repealed. On the advantage of cheap wool,
I need not dilate; and at all events, if it does nothing else, it will
enable certain aspirants to the Chancellorship to indulge in the
luxury of a cheap woolsack at their own homes, where they may
practise in private those judicial qualities of which they are not
allowed to give the public the benefit. (Hear.) |
Col. SIRTHoRP merely wished to ask, whether, in dealing with
marine insurances, there was any intention of insuring the lives of
the marines, who were often exposed to much danger. As the
marines frequently got shot, or died off, the policies would of course
become due, and then he (Col. SIBTHoRP) would be glad to know
what was to be done with the money
The CHANcellon of the ExchEquER replied, that when the money
from that source came in he should be prepared to tell the gallant
Colonel how he meant to dispose of it.
SIR VALENTINE BLAKE, in allusion to the reduction of the duty
on tumblers, would be glad to know if the clowns, in pantomimes,
who were a very deserving class, would be allowed the benefit.
The Chancellon of the Exchequer did not see what he had
to do with the benefits of clowns; but he should be happy to satisfy
SIR VALENTINE BLAKE if possible.
After some other business was disposed of, the House adjourned.
“THE LION-HEARTED FERRAND.”
Accord ING to an old Persian story, a town was thrown into great
perplexity by the stopping of the conduit that supplied it with water.
Men and women were running hither and thither, comfortless and
amazed. At length, it was discovered that the main pipe had been
choked up by an old worthless slipper. The paltry impediment was
removed with a feeling of angry contempt, and again the waters
flowed on—again the people were at ease.
For three nights have the proceedings of the House of Commons
been stopped by a FERRAND. The whole country, looking to Par-
liament for a supply of wholesome laws, for comfortable counsel, has
been denied the blessing, and all in consequence of a-FERRAND !
The case of the villanous old slipper is fully paralleled.
FERRAND – the “Lion-Hearted FERRAND,” as MR. OAst LER calls
him—charges SIR JAMEs GRAHAM with base, dishonourable conduct;
with, in fact, the subornation of forgery. He next accuses M.R. Hogg
of nothing short of perjury. These charges FERRAND can in no way
substantiate ; nevertheless, it is his humour to believe in the truth
of them ; whereupon, the House of Commons by unanimous vote
declares there is no truth whatever in the hon. member for Knares-
borough. MR. FERRAND will, doubtless, treat this vote with utter
disregard. There are some men, says Buake, who are at once
“contemptible and content.”
|
H |
To MR. Roebuck the country is indebted for this last historical
incident. The hon. gentleman is the self-installed keeper of the
Commons' conscience. His love of truth, however, is occasionally
a little perplexing. We shall be in no way surprised, if, suffering
from an access of veracity, the hon. member for Bath some night
moves for “a Committee of the whole House to inquire into the
falsehoods nightly propounded in that House by such Honourable
Members who wear wigs, and help their enunciation with false teeth.”

Rowland Hill's Triumphal Entry into St. Martin's-le-Grand.
THE PENNY POST MEDALS.
We herewith present to the reader a graphic representation of
the Penny Post Medal and its Qhverse, ordered to be struck by
Punch, in commemoration of an event much greater in its ultimate
results on the happiness of England, than the Battle of Waterloo.
Beautiful—much more beautiful to the eye of the philosopher, Punch—
is the red coat of the Postman with his bundle of penny missives,
than the scarlet coat of the Life Guardsman I For the Postman is
the soldier of peace—the humanizing, benevolent distributor of
records of hopes, affections, tenderest associations. He is the philan-
thropic go-between—the cheap and constant communicant betwixt
man and man. Very fine, indeed, are the Park guns; very grand
to some ears, to listen to their roaring throats, belching saltpetre in
honour of victories, of royal births, and royal marriages. Yet, Punch

thinks them worse than old iron, in comparison with the Postman's
bell, whose five o'clock sound tells him that one of Rowland Hill's
genii is in the street, who, for one penny, will make Punch hold sweet
discourse with his §ºd in the Hebrides — who will bring the
remotest part of the United Kingdom close to his own door-step for
a couple of halfpence.
In the Penny Post Medal Punch has endeavoured to show the
triumph of Row LAND Hill—no Greek or Roman triumph e'er so
great—carried in well-earned glory into the Post-office, Saint Mar-
tin's-le-Grand. If the beholder have any imagination, he will hear
huzzaing shouts—he will hear all the street-door knockers of the
kingdom for that moment instinct with joyous life, loudly knock,
knock, knocking in thundering accord. Such is the triumph of Row-
LAND Hill.
Turn we to the Obverse. It shows an old story; old as the ingra-
titude of man—old as the Old Serpent. Sir Robert PEEL, the
Tory Minister, no sooner gets into place than, in reward for the



## p. 193 (#207) ############################################

services of MR. Row LAND Hill, he turns him from the Post-office!
or as it is allegorically shown, he, as Britannia, presents him with—
the sack.
After this, a subscription is set a foot—(on which we shall further
descant)—to which SIR Rob ERT, with Magdalen penitence, sub-
scribes ten pounds ! Ten pounds ! It must be owned a very small
plaister to heal so cruel a cut !
We know that some folks, philosophers of the Sibthorpean
school—younger sons of Encolyon (see that glorious farthing epic
“— smooth Encolyon,
The son of Hermes, yet in all things slow,
With sight oblique, and forehead slanting high,
The dull retarder, chainer of the wheel,-"
We know that the Encolyons of our times bewail the Penny Post,
and long for the good days of ninepenny, tenpenny, and shilling
rates. Let them take heart and comfort themselves after this
fashion. Let them never send a letter without affixing thereto as
many penny portraits of HER MAJEsty as would make the good
old postage price. By these means will their delicate bigotry be
pleased, and the revenue be exalted.
But for those who consider the comfort, the sustaining comfort, the
happiness, and humanising influence of the communication of mind
with mind—let them—(even as good Catholics lift their hats at the
vesper sound), let them bless Row LAND Hill at the postman's
knock.
Reader, the postman, it is true, may bring a lawyer's letter.
Never mind that. Still utter a benison for Rowland HILL ; the
very law in the letter will be the finer test of thy philosophy, thy
gratitude 1

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MAY-DAY OF STEAM.
on May-morning—even the leaves of Jack-
shovel, no longer call on May-day for the
yearly dole. True it is, that impostors,
men lost to the sweetness of self-respect,
smile and pay. But, reader, put no faith in
such forlorn merry-makers; they are not sweepers. They never
made soot their daily bread. They know no more of the inside of a
chimney, than did Falstaff in his days of sack and sin know of the
inside of a church. They are hapless creatures, wanting the dignity
of a fixed profession; they are the gipsies of London, now boiling
their kettle in one alley, now in another; to-night sleeping in an
eastern door-way, to-morrow slumbering in St. James's Park. Some-
times, too, to pay the belly-tax, to eke out feverish life, sometimes
they pick a pocket. Sometimes, too, they become halfpennypanders
to lying rumour, and sell apocryphal deaths of foreign kings—declara-
tions of war—and particular accounts of the elopement of some
unborn wife, who has gone off “with her husband's footman.” And
on May-morning the deceivers take the characters of sweeps, and
dance the unwary out of halfpence. As for the real sweeps, they
have advanced in luxury, and dine at Copenhagen-house. They
dance, too, but then it is to the sounds of hireling minstrels; they
have become respectable, and have left the streets to cheats and
impostors, falsely calling themselves “my lord” and “my lady.”
Thus, the London man of thrift, hurrying to business, is only
reminded of May-day by rogues and vagabonds ! The May-day of
the milkmaids is passed away—the May-day of hawthorn, garlands,
and pipe and tabor is departed ; and in their place we have now the
May-day of Steam 1 |
Many of our readers will, we doubt not, be gladdened to learn that
the day in all the manufacturing districts was rung in by merry peals
from every church-steeple. All Manchester made a holiday. Bir.
mingham and Leeds washed the smoke and soot from their faces, and
donned garlands. We have voluminous accounts of the May-Day of
Steam, and all authentic – all from “our own reporters”—writing
from fifty different places in the kingdom. From this mass of
information, Punch will extract its essence in a few satisfactory
paragraphs.
It seems that the master-manufacturers—the mill-owners—the
lords of the steam-engine, who realise our fairy visions of Genii and
Magi, doing all things by their potency over elemental power—
making fire and water their tremendous, yet subservient vassals, it
seems that these excellent men, their hearts gushing with gratitude
towards the bounty of Steam that has made them kings, that has
heaped up wealth, hitherto thinly scattered, into a few mountains of
gold, making the poor poorer, and the rich richer, it appears that
they resolved to make holiday on May-Day, in thankfulness to their
thousands of workmen, and in gratitude to steam. Wherefore, early
on May morning—(in giving an account of the ceremony at one place,
be it observed that we describe the doings at all)—all the men,
women, and little children employed at the factory, arrived at their
place of labour, some carrying hawthorn boughs—some having
wreaths of flowers about their heads—some gay ribands. A band of
music was assembled at the doors of the factory; and when all the
people had arrived, they formed in procession; and entering the
building, with the masters at their head, they marched round the
engines, hushed and resting for that day, and laid reverent hand upon
them—and flung flowers over them—and stuck them all over with
green boughs; and cheered and huzzaed the giant power which,
though with might to rend a rock, is yet made tractable to a child's
finger. r
And when the engines had been duly decorated, all the people
departed where they listed, until moon. And then they met again,
and sat down to a feast in the factory; and the memory of JAMEs
WATT was drunk, not in solemn silence, but with loud, heart-grateful
shouts to the Giver of all Good, who had vouchsafed so great a bene-
factor to man.
After this, one of the workmen rose, and for a long time talked
of the said JAMEs WATT. His words, put in brief, were simply these.
He said that if steam had been called the ruthless destroyer of the
poor man's happiness, it was because its ultimate beneficence was
in-the-Green are withered—and the chim-
ney-sweepers, who were wont to summon
our half-pence, by the rattling broom and
do on May-day caper in the streets, and
with ghastly merriment strive to make us
unheeded. True it was, that its first operations—and society was
then in such a crisis—created great misery by the monstrous ine-
qualities of fortune it produced ; it placed the riches of the world
o longer milkmaids dance along the Strand in the hands of a favoured few. Nevertheless, its onward progress
must produce unmitigated good to the human race; for say that
all human labour could to-morrow be performed by the elemenus,
would the large family of man be content to wither piecemeal
from the earth, whilst a few elder sons of Luck and Mammon pos-
sessed all ! Oh, no; then would cease the gross, the wicked ine-
qualities of the world; then would men divide more in “conscience
and tender heart ; ” then the solemn needs of human life would be
more respected, and all men claim their fair share of the labours of
the elements—all men eat sufficingly of the fruits thereof. Mean-
while the problem must be worked out in patience, in tolerance, in
the earnest cheerfulness of hope 1
After this the people joined in dances—then some sang in chorus
|—then again they feasted; and in the evening all departed for their
homes, merry and comforted.
And in this way—though the circumstance has remained un-
noticed by the newspapers—passed the May-Day of Steam :
THE FRENCH SLAP AT ENGLAND.
A Few days ago, two French sub-officers at St. Omer were playing at
cards at a café, and this they made the stake; namely, that the loser should
give a slap to the first Englishman they met. In a few moments, an
Englishman entered the café; the game was played out : when the
valorous loser immediately walked up to our countryman, and struck him
in the face | A féte was expected to be given by the inhabitants of
St. Omer in honour of the chivalrous Frenchman.
Accounts from Paris state that the capital is in a ferment of rapture at
the news from St. Omer. A subscription has been opened, limited to
one sou a head, to purchase two swords for the gallant sub-officers.
“Honour to the bravel” will be inscribed on the blade of each weapon.
I.ord CowLEY has been to the Tuilleries to demand the punishment of
the sub-officers. It is stated that they will be sentenced to black the
boots, for at least half-a-year, of all the English boys at school at St. Omer.
It is believed that the whole army will rise !
Plaster casts of the right hand of the
gallant sub-officer who smote the English-
man are now hawked on the boulevards
of Paris at six sous each. In the palm
of the hand is a raised laurel - wreath,
encircling the words—“For perfidious
Albion.”
A new drama is advertised at the Théâtre des Variétés, by M. Scribe.
It is called “St. Omer; on le soufflet héroique ** Mossil:UR THIERs
and party have taken front boxes.
A youthful heiress of uncommon wealth—one * who hates the English”
—has offered to join her hand with the hand of the glorious sub-officer.
All France—represented by her various municipal authorities—will assist
at the nuptials. The children born of this union are to be adopted
by the nation.
One of the toy-makers on the Boulevards Italiens, has just exhibited a
mask of wirework. labelled—“Safety-masks for the perfidious English 1”
Latest accounts from Paris state that not only Englishmen, but
English women and English children, have their faces daily smitten
throughout the capital, by the brave soldiery. Yesterday, in the Rue de
la Paix, a grenadier having boxed the ears of an º nurse, spat in
the face of her English baby. It is clear from this little incident, that
the national enthusiasm is at its height !
Court Compliment.
At the last Drawing-Room, the ladies paid the most delicate compliment
to the KING of The Belgians, nearly all of them wearing his own
Brussels lace. The wife of the PREMIER was especially fine in the foreign
article. This conduct on the part of the peeresses and the wealthy women
of England is indicative of the most cultivated taste. Indeed, what can the
rough-handed English manufacturer produce worthy of Victoria's court."
Nothing—yes, one thing–Taxes 1

THE DEEDS OF MARLBOROUGH,
A FEw days ago there was an election at Woodstock, the Duke
or MARL honough's borough. The Duke's son was of course re-
turned, rice MR. THEsigER, refused by his Grace. MR. Hu MFREY,
who appeared to oppose the MARquis of BLANDF on D, addressed
the people, detailing to them the deeds of the Duke. We carefully
extract such doings from the lengthened oration, that at one view
the reader may observe the amount of debt due by the people of
Woodstock to the worthy Duke of MARLBorough. Yes, we give
the Duke's bill :—
To turning away Mr. SMALLBoNEs, farmer; the said SMALLBones
having, in his better days, lent money to the Dukes of Marl-
borough when they knew not where to get a shilling.
To raising the rent of 140 families, who paid 30s. per annum for
cottages, but were suddenly charged from 60s. to 80s., and
turned out on refusing my terms.
To prosecuting a man named HARRIs, who watered his horse,
illegally, at a pond in Woodstock. The said HARRIs was sum-
moned for pound-breach : fined 1s., with 19s. 6d. expenses.
He was sent to gaol; when there, his goods were taken in
execution ; and he is now working on the roads (doubtless
thinking of the virtues of the Duke of MARLBorough).
To the prosecution of a man named Wilkes, who found a piece of
“buck's-horn” (value 3d.) in Blenheim Park, and was fined
in 7s. 6d. costs.
To the prosecution of a man named BARTLETT, who, on the public
road, picked up and took away with him a rabbit half eaten by
a weazel. BARTLETT was fined 15s. ; in default of payment
was sentenced to 14 days' solitary confinement: he had just
recovered from the cholera.
To stopping a pension of 10s. a week, to a man named GRAnAM,
of 90 years' old—a pensioner on my father and grandfather.
To the prosecution of MR. JARDINE, tradesman, of Woodstock, who, |
his wife suffering from severe illness, took her into Blenheim
Park in a garden-chair. “She complained of being shaken,
by being drawn over the gravel.” Her husband drew her on |
the grass, when a fine of one farthing was inflicted, with costs,
upon her husband, the offender.
To the nailing up of a gate which led from certain almshouses—
endowed by a former Duchess of MARLBorough—to Wood.
stock Park, allowing the old almswomen entry to the said park.
And, finally, to refusing to pay a man named CASTLEs for the coffin
of my father, because I did not order it.-my father, notwith-
standing, being buried in the same coffin.
Such is the Duke of MARLBonough's bill—such his claims upon
the respect and affections of the country at large, and of the people
of Woodstock in particular. The bill has been harshly criticised.
Now, we defend it throughout.
As for the Duke's treatment of MR. SMALL.Bon Es, that, in a
common man, would be an act of vulgar ingratitude, mere plebeian
thanklessness: in his Grace, it can be nothing more than aristocratic
eccentricity—a bit of wayward humour, in no way implicating the
goodness of the ducal heart.
And then for raising the rent of 140 pauper families; why, the
Duke, in his palace of Blenheim, knows the comforts of a roof, and
very properly lays the highest price upon the accommodation.
As for the man HARRIs, what business had he to trespass on the
Duke's water, when, sure we are, that the DUKE has proved a full
right to the horse-pond all to himself?
Again, if a., man is to be pardoned for carrying away a bit of
“buck's-horn,” because it is worth only three-pence, is the Duke
himself safe? The bit of “buck's-horn” may be thought by vulgar
people to have no value whatever; but no man better than the
Duke knows how to prize a thing which all the world beside deems
utterly worthless.
In the next case, one BART LETT carries away a half-eaten rabbit,
the leavings of a weasel. Now, there is but little doubt that the
defrauded weasel intended to return to its repast. The DUKE knew
this, and by fining BART LETT, only showed an acute sympathy for
the vermin that cumbers the land.
As for stopping the weekly pension to a pauper of ninety, the
Duke did perfectly right. The natural life of man is fourscore,
and GRAHAM had outraged human nature—the Duke is a good
judge of the offence—full ten years.
Next, MR. JARDINE draws his sick wife on the soft grass of
Blenheim Park, and is fined a farthing, with expenses, for the
iniquity. The DUKE, by such charge, shows his delicate value of green
provender ; no worthier judge of grass since NEBuchadnezzan
Again, the Duke nails up a door, shutting out old women from
Woodstock Park. Very proper. What has poverty to do with the
sun, the sky, and the fresh breath of heaven Its only right to the
earth is to be found some three or four feet under it.
The DUKE refuses to pay for the coffin of his father. Now, this
refusal must arise from some misapprehension of His GRAcE, who,
we fear, is not sufficiently impressed with the benevolent intentions
of his neighbours. What I Duke of MARLBorough refuse to
pay for the coffin of your deceased sire? Nay, pull out your purse—
discharge the bill. For who, when fate shall call you from this vale
of tears, who, we ask, would for a moment regret to pay the like
account for you ?

RECALL OF LORD ELLENROROUGH.
ord ELLENBorough's recall from India by the Court
of Directors of the East India Company has occa-
sioned considerable astonishment. It certainly does
seem odd that a number of gentlemen whose energies
are generally devoted to the state of the tea market,
should have the power of recalling a Governor-General
from India. We are fortunately able, from our
peculiar sources of information, to give the actual
letter by which Lord ElleNBorough has been
ordered home. We subjoin it without comment.
My Lord,
Having received numerous communications
from esteemed correspondents complaining of your
hasty and pugnacious
conduct, we beg that
you will accept the usual
notice, (one month from
the date hereof) at the
expiration of which time
you must consider your-
self discharged from the
service of
Your obedient Servants,
The DIRECroRs of THz Hon. EAST INDIA CoMPANY.
P.S. We shall be happy to allow your travelling expenses,

here last week in Tomkins's stable,
which was fitted up as a theatre.

unfor-
tunate. He left the town under heavy liabilities, and though his com-
pany was not followed, he was personally a great deal run after. He was
strongest in the ballet, and he led several of the townspeople to a very
pretty dance; for his premièredanseuse was attended to the theatre by nearly
all the youths of the place, who formed a procession after her. Her
hotel—the Goose and Gallipot—was surrounded with the populace; and,
in the evening, the tap was brilliantly illuminated. She is everywhere
hailed as the funstable Taglioni; and the inhabitants, through the hands
of their headborough, have presented her with a bonnet, inclosing the
freedom of Dunstable, and surmounted with a plaited crown, encircled
by ribands, the sarsnet for which alone was valued at a very high figure.
DINNER TO MR. HULLAH AT CAMBRIDGE.
On Tuesday last a dinner was given at Cambridge to Mr. Hullah, by
the graduates of the University who are under his instruction.
After the cloth was removed, the Chairman rose to enunciate a toast,
and he felt sure the company would not be wanting in a demonstration.
He was delighted to regard the University as the patron of everything
good: he considered the members of the University to be bricks, united
by the mortar of harmony. The beautiful effect produced by the simul-
taneous ringing of all the college-bells, from six in the morning till six at
night, showed that the University patronised music. His antipathy to
long prefaces was well known; he would therefore at once propose, “The
health of Mr. Hullah ; and might he render the University as famous for
music, as they were superior to all the world in everything else.' (Cheers.)
Glee—“The Bells of St. Michael's Tower.”
Mr. Hullah rose. He was, he said, most extensively exhilarated. If
he might use the terms of his art, this was no common time with him.
His heart, which usually beat minims, was now performing an adagio
movement in #time.
If, before, he might have been represented by a crotchet, he now became
a dotted note, for he felt half as large again. He certainly hoped to ren-
der the University as famous for notes as they had long been for letters.
Much had been said against his system, but he would challenge any one
(and he used the word ‘challenge’ in the sense which it bore before the
late State Trials), he would challenge any one to show that it had ever
failed. He should therefore continue to treat all the abuse bestowed on
his system as a mere nothing—in fact, as so many Pennsylvanian Bonds.
Mr. Hullah thanked the company, and resumed his seat amidst loud
cheering.
After the cloth was removed, the company performed some of Mr.
HULLAH's lessons in a very creditable style.
On going up stairs to coffee the conversation became highly scientific.
One gentleman was demonstrating a geometric proposition, using a muffin
and several triangular pieces of toast for a diagram ; while the Chairman
was investigating the nature of tides, by ...; the milk with a fork.
Our reporter was obliged to withdraw to prepare his dispatches; but from
the ascending powers of tea which he met on the stairs, he concluded that
the meeting was not likely soon to break up.
Shakspeare at Court.
HER MAJEsry, compassionating the benighted condition of St. James's
in its ignorance of the English drama, has graciously appointed Charles
KEMBLE, Esq., to diffuse Shakspearianity throughout her royal court. MR.
KEMBLE began his labours a few days ago, by reading Cymbeline ; the
drama having been previously purified and j by his son, the
examiner of plays. The next reading was ordered that day six months.
UNREPORTED ILLUMINATIONS.
Although the daily papers gave columns to the chronicling of the illu-
minations on HER MAJESTY's birth-night, very important cases of light
were omitted. We hasten to name them.
The York Column.
The illumination was very chaste, yet very insignificant; the head of
the Duke's statue being surrounded by the three letters I. O. U.
BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSTITUTE, OR CUCKOO’s NEST.
This display quite eclipsed every other in Hanover Square. It was a
magnificent oil transparency, showing the full length portrait of MR. SILK
BuckinghAM (in a turban), receiving the allegiance and the year's sub-
scription of his subjects the members; all of whom, by the way, seemed
admirably done.
The Constitution again in Danger.
has frequently been our painful duty
to point the finger of caution through
the archway of the Burlington-arcade,
till it has rested on one who is armed
with a weapon which we have been the
first to denounce as dangerous to the
Constitution. This is not the time for
a vacillating delicacy; and we, there-
fore, unhesitatingly tear off the mask of
reserve, and assert at once, that our
allusion is aimed at that unhappy man
—for unhappy we are justified in calling
him—who wields the destinies of the Arcade in one hand, and the
bludgeon of his office in the other.
It was, therefore, with a feeling of unmitigated alarm, that we
observed, the other day, in that Quadrant with which the name of
Regent is identified—it was, we say, with unmitigated alarm, that we
noticed the erection of two chairs, upon which a sort of duarchy has
been set up, comprising a double beadleocracy, at the contemplation
of which we are at this moment violently shuddering. Very far are
we from underrating the value of that fine old remnant of feudal
feeling which exists only in the Metropolitan streetkeepery—a race
of men, who, like the native Indians, are being fast driven westward
towards the setting sun; but we do not think that these are the
times for introducing a new and unpopular despotism into the heart
of a crowded thoroughfare. Already has juvenile irritability been
excited, and many a youthful finger has been placed sneeringly on the
end of the infantine nose, with that significance which never yet was
pointed at power without the desire, at least, of undermining it.
As we looked on those empty chairs, we involuntarily thought of
Canute, whose easy elbow was washed away by the tide-as the sea
of popular indignation may one day, overwhelm the gold-laced
oligarchs, who are attempting to lord it over the tribes that throng
the quarter in which the beadleocracy seems attempting to establish
itself.
STREET WOICES.
Ah what is man 1–You ask yourself the query,
In vain you muse: you give it up ; when lo!
Yon moralist, whose gait proclaims him beery,
From 'neath his fan-tailed beaver shouts—“Dust, O.”
Friendless and spiritless, bereft of Hope,
In anguish, too, from corns or, may-be, bunions,
You hear a friendly voice cry “Buy a rope; ”
You rush to purchase one, when, lo!—it's onions.

DIFFUSION OF SHAKSPEAREANITY AT COURT.
Our gracious Queen, as we briefly stated in our last, summoned
a few nights since M.R. CHARLEs KEMBLE to Buckingham Palace,
that he then and there might enter upon the goodly work of diffusing
ShakspeaREANITY through the hearts and minds of the natives
abiding within the royal
precincts; and we are
happy to learn that al-
though MR. KEMBLE
found the greater number
of the individuals in a
very benighted condition
in as far as related to
their knowledge and ap-
preciation of the enno-
bling qualities of the Great
Teacher, they neverthe-
less—the great defects of
their education considered
—evinced a degree of in-
terest and aptitude, which
MR. KEMBLE believes
may in good time be made
to produce the very best
fruits.
We have received a
letter from Mr. KEMBLE
on the subject. It will
be seen from the docu-
ment that he has uncon-
sciously fallen into the
Missionary style of com-
position; a circumstance, perhaps, hardly to be wondered at, when
we consider the importance of his new duties. (An antiquarian
friend has also favoured us with an extremely old and rude wood-
engraving of Shakspeare, as he was wont to appear before the Virgin
ElizaBETH.)
FROM CHARLES KEMBLE TO PUNCH.
My very Dean MR. Punch,-Delighting in the interest you
have always manifested for the progress of literature and the arts,
cherished and honoured as they are by our beloved mistress, the
QUEEN, I hold it to be no other than my duty to forward to you,
and through you to the whole universe, the subjoined report of my
labours up to the present time at Buckingham Palace, for the diffusion
of SHAkspeaREANITY throughout the court.
Her Majesty received me with the greatest cordiality, and PRINCE
ALBERT, by the very attentive manner with which he listened to
me, shewed an example of decorum which I am sure was not lost
upon the inferior people. He is evidently a young man of good
natural understanding, although the unfortunate prejudices of his
station may have hitherto caused him to neglect his SHAkspeaRE for
the more frivolous pursuits of rabbit-shooting and sitting for five
hundred portraits. Nevertheless, the many questions he put to me
respecting SHAkspeaRE, namely, as to where the Poet was born,-
whether he had been apprenticed to any business, whether he died
married or a bachelor—whether he had really invented mulberries,
—with other curious interrogatives, all shewed to me that the mind
of the Prince was at least hungry for a better knowledge of the
Moral Master. Indeed, I have every hope from the interest already
awakened in the royal breast, that PRINCE ALBERT will, in a short
time, wholly renounce the idols of the Opera; and as a most con-
vincing proof of his belief in SHAkspeaRE, sit out the Petruchio of
MR. WEBs TER.
I shall now, MR. Punch, proceed to give you a few cases illus-
trative of my success in QUEEN Victon IA's Court, heartily hoping
that they will be multiplied ten thousand fold. For most charitable
reasons, I suppress the names, giving only the occupations of my
neophytes.
“A MAID of Honoun, AGE 23–Had certainly heard of SHAK-
speaRE, when a little girl and before she came to court ; but had
seldom had her attention called to the subject since. Did not know
where he was born. Believes that he was dancing-master to Queen
Elizabeth. Thinks she has heard it said that he was a low man,
and wrote very bad English; for that reason was advised never to
hear him except in Italian at the opera. Knew an opera called Otelio;
was sure she knew it, because GR1s1 and LaBLAche played in it !
Had certainly heard of the swan of Avon ; believes that she once saw
it in the Zoological Gardens. It was a white swan.”
[I am happy to inform you, MR. Punch, that such has already been my
success with this benighted young woman, that she has broken a very
pretty plaster statuette of RUBINI on her dressing-table, and every night
takes her rest with the FAMILY SHAKESPEARE under her pillow.]
“A Woman of THE BEDcHAMBER, AGE 32.-Had heard of
SHAkspeaRE several times. Saw The Murder of Macbeth once ; was
sure it was The Murder of Macbeth, for a MR. CHARLEs KEAN played
the principal part. Never went to the play; no, never; that is,
except on a royal visit, which was as good as never. Remembers to
have seen MR. BALPE's Falstaff at the opera; liked it very well;
but thought Falstaff at the play-houses only fit for low people.
Remembers to have heard of Romeo and Juliet when a girl. Never
looked into SHAKs PEARE ; it was not considered proper. Had seen
GENERAL Tom THUMB three times; kissed him on each occasion.
Once heard part of the Tempest; thought CALIBAN a disgusting
creature; had seen and liked the Ojibbeways very much.”
[I assure you, MR. PUNCH, so great has been my influence over this
darkened individual, that she has not visited the opera this ten days, and,
as a proof of her conversion to ShakspeaRE, has expressed herself ready
to go even to the Victoria to endure him.]
“A GENTLEMAN of THE BED-CHAMBER, AGE 40.-Had heard of
ShakspeaRE, but thought him a bore. Had seen Hamlet once ; he
didn't mean the silversmith, but Hamlet, the Duke of Denmark;
thought it very dull and unsatisfactory. What had Hamlet to com-
plain off Wasn't he a Prince, with a devilish fine girl to marry,
and all that Thought there was no interest in Hamlet; liked some-
thing that touched the feelings; for instance, admired the Maid and
Magpie.”
[Judge my delight, MR. Punch, when, after only three interviews with
this forlorn individual, he was found devouring ShakespeaRE raw at the
Pavilion.]
“AN EquERRY, AGE 27.-Had, in his time, heard of SHAkspeaRE:
might have been a slap-up fellow in his day, but was too slow for
these times. Once saw the Merchant of Venice; old Shylock was a
bill-discounter of the tribe of Levi. Never went to the play. Never
missed CARLoTTA GR1s1.”
[This gentleman, after only two readings, dismissed twenty pictures of
the Pets of the Ballet from the walls of his bed-room, and promoted to his
dormitory a magnificent bust of SHAKESPEARE.]
Such, MR. Punch, are a few of my conversions at the Palace. As
I proceed in my labours you shall hear more; meanwhile, believeme,
Yours, with fervent admiration and respect,

Garrick Club, May 7.
THE OPENING OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE.
His splendid ornament of the metropolis
was thrown open to the public on Thurs-
day last, and the ceremony was attended
by all the boys that could be got together
on the spur of the moment from the
streets in the neighbourhood. A juvenile
party instantly began to “christen” the
posts, by leaping over them ; and no
square-keeper having been regularly
sworn in, the whole spot was a scene
of alarming anarchy, until K 12, with
considerable presence of mind—although
not on duty—invested himself with the
striped band for the wrist, and took his station on the top step, com-
manding a view of the flats of asphaltum which spread themselves
slantendicularly down towards the cab-stand.
Amongst the other objects of interest at Trafalgar Square, we
must notice particularly the two extensive washhand-basins, cut out
into the shape of the shells used for scolloping oysters, from a design
in the possession of the Messrs. LYNN, of Fleet-street. These
aqueous receptacles were the subjects of various nautical experi-
ments, in honour, no doubt, of the great naval hero on the summit
of the column ; and who, by-the-by, looks as if he contemplated
suicide by jumping from the top of it. Several paper boats were
launched on the surface of the tawny fluid, and altogether a
No. 148.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
T
decidedly aquatic turn was given to the day's proceedings, some of
the boys sprinkling their companions festively with the salubrious
element.
The only drawback to the general hilarity was occasioned by the
non-removal of the wooden hoard from the base of the Nelson
Column. We understand that a difficulty as to the price of the iron
railings is the cause of this unsightly continuance of the wood-work ;
but it is confidently hoped that the ironmonger will see the matter
in its proper light in the course of a few days, and put up those
spikes, the absence of which, on Thursday, the assembled multitudes
so much deplored.
ACADEMY EXHIBITION.
HAving just returned from this delicious place of entertainment,
—our brains whirling with the delirious excitement of the scene,—
we have scarce time to collect our scattered senses and to put down
hastily our impressions of this gorgeous galaxy of talent.
Among the portraits, we remarked—
691. Portrait of the Hat of His Royal Highness PRINCE ALBERT ;
with His Royal Highness's favourite boot-jack. His Royal Highness's
Persian wolf-dog, MIRzA, is lying on the latter, while the former is
in the possession of His Royal Higness's diminutive spaniel, Miss
KIDLUMY.—Sandseer, R. A.
This magnificent piece of Art has all that Mastery of execution,
that chiaroscurosity of handling—above all, that thrilling, dramatic
interest which distinguishes the most popular of our painters. The
gallant wolf-hound of Irawn sits scowling over the utensil of the
consort of England's Sovereign, which seems to say, “Nemo me
impunè lacessit.” The boot-jack is a miracle of art—had we not worn
Bluchers, in good sooth we should have been tempted to try it ; so
marvellous is the illusion produced. As for the litle spaniel, Miss
KIDLUMY, what can we say, but that she is a perfect lore ? The
biscuit she holds in her mouth may have been painted by a SAND-
sEER, but we vow must have been designed by a LEMANN : it is one
of the sort usually sold at three a penny. The fluff of the hat is
handled with a gossamer lightness, and the maker's name is a com-
plete illusion. This work stamps MR. SANDseen not only as a great
delineator, but a noble and exquisite poet. His
996. Parroquet with a Muffin, (the property of the Queen of the
Belgians).
1763. Grouse Shooting. Cockaleckie Castle.
2844. Salmon Leaping. (Scene from the river Snuffmull, off the
heights of Whistlebinkie. Morning).
25. The Highland Luncheon.
“Gin a' the binks that fa’ your body,
Your bubbly Jock and winsome poddie,
Your lilting, filting, linkum doddie,
Should gar your ee.”
The words of the Ayrshire bard were never more admirably
illustrated. The tail of the Kelpie in the distance, is, perhaps, a
little out of drawing ; but the Stot is the very picture of life; and
the mutton-ham with which the sheep-dog (both are likenesses of
eminent political characters) is running away, is unparalleled.
MAcLish, R.A., has
991. 1434. 1684. 4. 76. 1999. Subjects from that admirable novel,
Gil Blas—a work lately published, and of the greatest humour; like-
wise,

Borough's.
8496. MARIA curling Olivia's hair before going to Farmer FLAM-
Borough's.

176. 8.4499. and thirteen more, are from the same delightful work,
upon which indeed all our artists have made an attack, for we have
MULRowdy, R.A., with 1904, The Vicar of Wakefield smoking
the pipe in the orchard with MR. BURchELL.
2306. Ma. Buachell in London, purchasing a roll of Virginia for
the Vicar. (An admirable piece, with all the humour of RAPHAEL,
and all REMBRANDT’s correctness of design.)
316. MRs. PRIM Rose ironing her mittens—a sweet piece in the true
CLAUDE manner. We counted, besides, six other designs from the
same delightful work, and from the unmistakeable pencil of MR.
LEDslie, R.A., three hundred and thirty-six drawings in illustration
of this most popular novel.
TRUNDLER, R.A., treats us with some magnificent pieces.
tnoy AFTER TENirns (TEN YFARs).
34. A Typhoon bursting in a simoon over the whirlpool of Mael-
strom, Norway, with a ship on fire, an eclipse, and the effect of a lunar
rainbow.
O Art, how vast thy misty wonders are,
To those who roam upon the extraordinary deep ;
Maelstrom thy hand is here.
From an unpublished poem.
4. (Great room.) Hippopotamuses at play in the river Scamander.
1311. The Duke of WELLING 1 on and the Shrimp (Seringapatam,
early suarin).
And can it be, thou hideous imp,
That life is ah! how brief, and glory but a shrimp !
From an unpublished poem.
We must protest against the Duke's likeness here; for though his
grace is short, his face is not of an emerald-green colour; and it is
his coat, not his boots, which are vermilion; nor is it fair to make
the shrimp (a blue one) taller than the conqueror of Assaye ; with
this trifling difference of opinion, we are bound to express our highest
admiration of the work. It is the greatest that the English school of
quiet landscape has produced. The comet just rising over the cata-
ract in the foreground, and the conflagration of TIPPoo's widow in
the Banyan forest by the sea shore, are in the great artist's happiest
manner. Our favourite
Picklegill, R.A., has fourteen admirable portraits.
47. MAJon Bulden, and 48. Mns. MAJon BULDEk (worthy of a
TINTonet).
906. Colossal figure of GeoRGE Blopoe R Rongmone, Esq., M.P.,
of Rodgmore Hall, painted on occasion of the bill for inclosing Cowitch
Common, and hung in the lower hall of that city. A grand, we had
almost said, a stalactitic piece. MR. Rodomon E is represented in a
white waistcoat, and pepper-and-salt trousers, pointing to a scroll of
papers, and as if looking up at a picture of the late eminent William
PITT ; Rodgmore Park is seen in the distance, the trees tinted by
autumn, and a whirlwind raging above them in the stormy sky. A
curricle, probably containing MRs. Blood Ea Rong MoRE, completes
the illusion. The Turkey carpet is a miracle of painting, and the
seals hanging from the inexpressibles of the principal figure, are per-
fect * of pictorial skill. Our dictum is, Bravo, MR. Pickle-
GILL
Water-Colour Room. 1915, 1803. “Hecuba parting from Lucius
Junius Brutus before the battle of Lepanto; and ARIADNE
visiting Diogenes LAERT1Us in the island of Patmos. Drawings in
stick liquorice are in the well-known manner of MR. JonAs, R.A.;
but the rest of our notices must be reserved for a future day.

A BALLET OF ACTION AT LAW.
Irirst Tableau.
The Court (des Miracles), or Court of Queen's Bench, at Westminster.
As the curtain rises, the stage is seen thronged with lawyers and their
clerks. The Chief, DENMAN, seated on the judicial chair, presides over
the savage assembly. Whilst the buzz and confusion are at their height,
John Dor, the plaintiff, rushes to the feet of DENMAN, pursued by a crowd
of young barristers, in search of briefs and plunder. DENMAN asks him
h's business, but the miserable plaintiff casts a terror-stricken look around
him, and, on perceiving that he is in the Cour des Miracles, or Court of
Queen's Bench, faints in the usher's arms. The savage lawyers rush upon
him, with the purpose of robbing him, but the miserable DoE has nothing
on him, except a motion of course, which the lawyers, not valuing, they
doom him to speedy execution, by saying he may go and
be hanged. Almost mad with fear, the plaintiff casts
himself at the feet of the juniors, when a stifled murmur
announces the approach of the “elegant”, THEsigER.
Skipping lightly into the front row, THESIGER immediately
comprehends the meaning of the plaintiff's agony. An
attorney, standing by, snatches the motion paper from the
hands of Doe, and a pas de do ensues, during which the
fee is transferred to the pocket of the lawyer. THESIGER
trips carelessly between them, and catches the eye of the
judge. . The elegant solicitor makes a motion of course.
It is for a distringas to compel an appearance. His
prayer is granted. The joy of the plaintiff knows no
bounds, and he rushes from the Court in a paroxysm of
_* extasy, leaving the disappointed barristers, holding up
their hands in an attitude of utter and hopeless brieflessness.
second Tableau.
A week is supposed to elapse between the Firust and second acts.
Le Jour de Service—the Day of Service.—A small chamber, with a
bedstead, a table, and a chair.
The defendant enters sad and melancholy. He is gazing on a small
square piece of card, inscribed with the word “Coat," and the figures
“10s. 6d.” immediately under it. While buried
in this reverie, the plaintiff enters. He advances
with an air of timid triumph, and places his hand
on the shoulder of the poor defendant; he recoils,
and the other pursues him, but when on the point
of seizing him, he sees the nob of a walking-stick
glittering before his eyes, the plaintiff explains that
he only wishes some security for the debt, and
capers before the defendant, meaning that the latter
has led him a very pretty dance. The defendant
shakes his head mournfully, and ultimately receives
from the plaintiff a parchment scroll. The former,
after looking at it with deep emotion, tramples it
under his foot, and the plaintiff, as if worn down by
the trouble and excitement of the day, slowly retires.
When alone, the defendant throws himself on the
chair, which, by his evident uneasiness, is shown to be no longer an easy
one. Scarcely has he done so, than Selby enters with a ji. fa., and
proceeds to remove the table and the couch. The defendant raises his
stick, as if to strike, when the plaintiff, coming suddenly behind him,
seizes the end of it, and Selby rushes out with the couch and the tabse.
The defendant turns desperately on the plaintiff, who protects himself

carries off, leaving the defendant apparently lifeless on the barren and
now unfurnished floor.
Third Tableau.
A week is supposed to ELAPSE BET ween the second And third Acts.
L'heure d'attentat—The hour of trial—La Cour des Shérifs dans le Carré
du Lion Rouge.—The Sheriffs' Court, in Red Lion-square.
The hall is fitted up for justice being (regularly) done. A crowd of
witnesses flock in upon one side, and seem to affirm a fact, when suddenly

another crowd of witnesses flock in on the other side, and deny it. The
judge and jury exchange glances. The latter whisper a few moments
apart. At length the judge takes a coin from his pocket, and throws it
gently up with the point of his thumb, catching it between the palms of
both his hands. The foreman of the jury advances towards the judge and
looks at the coin, then telling the jury the result, a verdict is instantly
§. in the plaintiff's favour. The defendant's attorney runs wildly out of
ourt, without paying the counsel's fee. The jury precipitate themselves
into a public-house, where they are met by the plaintiff, and the rest of
the day is devoted to mirth and jollity, which are greatly enhanced by the
presence of the usher of the Court.
Fourth Tableau.
No TIME is supposiºd to ELAPSE Bretween THE THIRD and fourth Acts.
Terre de Raquette sur le Banc de la Reine; or, Racket Ground of the
Queen's Bench.
The stage is filled with prisoners, some of whom are playing at racquets,
others at skittles, while a group at one end appear occupied in smoking
cigars. The defendant enters mournfully, and at first endeavours to hide
himself in the crowd of smokers. One of the skittle players tempts him
by tossing up a huge wooden ball, but the defendant waves his hand
mournfully, and turns upon his heel. A shout from the racquet players
seems to awaken new life in him, and he puts on a look indicative of his
yearning after the innocent days of his guileless infancy. At that moment
one of the racquet players is called away, and defendant is invited to take
his place. He soon enters into the spirit of the game ; but having bet on
the result, he loses all that he has, in addition to a good deal that he has
—-exº~
not. A confusion ensues, and the scene winds up with a wild and reckless
mélee.
Fifth Tableau.
a Quarter of an hour does elapse between the founth and Fifth acrs.
La Féte des Fous, or Feast of Lunatics. The Bankruptcy Court of
Commissioner Williams, at Basinghall Street.
The Commissioner enters, preceded by the messenger and followed by
the charwoman. They execute a pas de trois, and the Commissioner goes

through a portion of the college hornpipe with a bankrupt, who is doing
the double shuffle in very quick time. Williams looks over an empty
ledger, having left his spectacles at home, and compliments the bankrupt
on the clearness with which he has kept his books. Williams motions
that they are unobjectionable, and, after a few extraordinary capers, passes
them in great haste. The defendant now enters, and the Commissioner,
looking at his watch, indicates that dinner-hour is nearly at hand. . He is
about to adjourn defendant's case sine die, when an old man rushes in
attended by Indian slaves. It is the defendant's uncle, who produces º
will, and drops down lifeless on the stage. The will is opened, and is found
to bestow an enormous fortune on the defendant. The plaintiff now enters,
and is at first standing gloomily apart, but on the will being shown to him
he embraces the defendant, and both of them embrace the Commissioner.
The back of the scene opens, and discovers Doctors' Commons, with the
Court of Chancery, a little way behind. The Commissioner dismisses the
fiat, and the ballet concludes with a grand allegorical design of a Superse-
deas, in which Fame is seen suppressing a copy of the London Gazette ;
while the Tritons are baling out water from Neptune's shell, Commissioner
Williams singing, by way of Solo, the first and last verses of “Britannia
rules the Waves.” |

THE RECALL OF LORD ELLENBOROUGH.
Othello.
O now, for ever,
Farewell the tranquil mind farewell contentſ
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
That make ambition virtue ! O, farewell I
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trumpet,
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner; and all quality,
Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war !
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,
Farewell! “ELLEN B Ro's '' occupation 's gone!
MR. W. Williams begged to call the attention of the House to the very
awkward position in which a very respectable person had been placed by
the recall of the Governor-General of India. The House would probably
remember that during the whole of the Indian War, and the Disasters of
Cabul (as performed at Astley's Amphitheatre), the character of Lord
Ellenborough was in the hands of MR. Widnicomb (hear, and a laugh).
He, Mr. Williams, now wished to inquire how the recall of the Governor-
General would affect the position of MR. Widdicomb, and whether he
would be expected to resign the important duties that had hitherto
devolved upon him (cheers and laughter).
SIR. R. PEEL complained of being taken by surprise.
SiR VALENTINE BLAKE could bear testimony to the efficient manner in
which the duties of Governor-General had been discharged in India and
at Astley's. Lord ELLENBoRough had had a difficult part to play, and so
had Widdicomb. He º VALENTINE BLAke) had been present when the
latter had read the whole of the dispatches from the top of an elephant's
back : and he º WALENTINE BLAke) doubted whether Lord ElleN-
Borough himself, amidst all his brilliant achievements, had accomplished
one that was equal to the feat alluded to (Hear, hear).
SIR Robert PEEL would be glad to know whether the honourable mem-
ber had any motion to propose (A laugh).
SIRVALENTINE BLAke had hardly made up his mind what to do (Hear).
Perhaps the better course would be to wait until the Ministers had deter-
mined whether they should propose a vote of confidence in Lord ElleN-
Borough. If this course were taken, would it (asked the hon, member)
be competent for me to propose that the resolution should embrace
Widdicomb? (Hear and a laugh).
Colonel Sibthorp said that it was competent for the honourable mem-
ber to propose what he pleased—but what he pleased, or what pleased
him, was not very likely to please the House, and he (Colonel Sierhear)
for one would vote against it.
SIR WALENTINE BLAKE, MR. W. Williams, and Colonel Sibthorp all
rose at once, when they having ascertained that there were only three
members present, they counted each other out. The House adjourned.

DECORATIONS of the NEW HOUSES or PARLIAMENT,
LENGTH the exhibition of the
designs for decorating the
new Houses of Parliament
has opened, at the St.
James's Bazaar, in King
Street. The precaution of
taking away one's walking-
stick on entering is a very
wise one, for had we been
permitted to “walk up.”
º with it in our hands, we
should have been tempted–out of mere respect for the credit of British
art—to have smashed at least one half of the specimens.
The articles in which the imagination had been called upon to revel,
were chièfly doors and windows, bells and knockers, fire-places, hat pegs,
and pavements. On the grand staircase are a pair of grates, one of
which is apparently by Rippon and Burton, while the other seems to
combine all that slightness of construction and brilliancy of polish which
are characteristic of the stoves that emanate from the Little Dust-pan in
Holborn.
The door of the House of Lords seems to be the object which has chiefly
inspired the fancy of the competitors. There is considerable rampancy
about some of the designs, particularly No. 7, where the Barons are
represented as demanding the charter from KING John—and John is
signing it with an instrument that looks a good deal like a MERCURy's
wand, or, perhaps, the English sceptre; in fact, it is like anything but a
pen, while ink is evidently out of the question, for there is not an ink-
stand of any description in the apartment where John and the Barons
are assembled.
There are, of course, a vast number of St. GeoRGEs and the Dragons,
in which the dragon is differently treated, though, perhaps, ill-treated
would be the better term for it.
Another of the designs exhibits a series of carvings illustrative of some
of the principal events in the life of Alfred. One of them represents
him in the act of overdoing the cakes of the neatherd's wife; and the
manner in which the artist has shadowed forth the excessive baking is
really exquisite. This beautiful little bit of art almost deserves the second
title of a “Knight wi' Burns.”
The specimens of wrought-iron work are very numerous, and we
observed a complete set of a knocker, a door-bell, and a key-hole, which most
exquisitely giveusthe idea of one of our great nationalamusements, from the
emblem being the head of a clown. The plan of the House itself is a
rare specimen of ingenuity, being intended to suggest the arrangement of
the rooms after the building is finished. The various apartments are rather
curiously described, and there are also extensive store-rooms, intended,
we presume for parliamentary Fºl. and preserves, judicial jams,
with other legislative luxuries. The cloak-room is very capacious, and
is designed probably for the use of members. A very extensive space is
also assigned as the door-keeper's dressing-room,
which is, we presume, fitted up with tackle for the
toilette of the official alluded to. Among the
specimens was a design for the door-keeper's
hair-brush, of which we subjoin a counterpart.
On the whole we are unable to speak favourably of the decorative works
in the present collection. Some of the specimens of pavement are evi-
dently modelled on the kaleidoscope, a lucky turn of which occasionally
converts a shirt button, a bit of glass, a pin, and a spangle, into a very
fine pattern of Egyptian workmanship.
SCOTCH SHREWDNESS.
The other day LoRD BRough AM was very angry with Lord Campbell
for calling Edinburgh the Modern Athens; but surely Glasgow is entitled
to the appellation of the Modern Gotham, from which three wise men are
said to have started on a naval expedition—in a bowl.
A bridge over the Clyde having become ricketty and unsafe, has been
shut up, and a meeting having been held, it was resolved “to build a new
bridge on the site of the old one ;” and a second resolution was instantly
passed “to repair the old bridge so as to make it serve until the new one is
completed.” By what ingenious piece of mechanism the old bridge is to
be replaced by a new one—which is to be built on the site of the old,
while the old still occupies the place destined for the new—must be left to
the ingenuity of the wise men of Glasgow, to whom we recommend a con-
ference with the sages of Gotham, as being likely to furnish very valuable
suggestions.
GUI I, DhALL HOSPITALITY.
The LoRD MAYor, having begun his banquets with the Bench of Bishops,
has resolved to dine right through the Church, ending with the Welch
Curates. He will conclude with a wind-up supper to all the Beadles and
Pew-openers.
THE REWARD OF BACCHUS.
A pay or two since, one Elias FuRMAGER, private of the Grena.
dier Guards, rushed after a respectable married woman to her house
in New Peter-street, Westminster. The woman locked her room-
door, when the said Elias, drunk and furious as any satyr, broke
open the door and seized his victim, who screamed from the window
for help. Overpowered, she fainted, and was discovered by a woman
who resides in the same street “hanging half out of the window in
an insensible state.” MR. JARDINE, the Solon of Queen-square, look-
ing awful as Justice at the soldier, asked him what he had to say in
his defence; and Elias FuRMAGER answered, that “he was rery
sorry for what had occurred, but that he was cery drunk at the time!”
Merciful as wise is oft the magisterial mind; for MR. JARDIN E
avowedly taking such drunkenness “into consideration,” and doubt-
less believing that “none but the brave deserve the fair,” inflicted
the penalty of ten shillings on the son of Mars, flushed as he was with
gin and love 1
Beautiful is the charity of MR. JARDIN E towards Bacchus; sweet
the compassion at Queen-square for drunkenness, which, taking the
benefit of its own wrong, obtains a handsome discount of a magistrate
for evil-doing !
It is pleasant, too, to record the gratitude of men towards such
philanthropic intelligence. We understand that the officers of the
Grenadier Guards have invited MR. Jardine to an early banquet, in
token of their sense of his paternal tenderness towards a drunken son
of glory.
Several publicans, feeling the breeches-pocket value of MR.
JARD1NE's sentence, have subscribed towards a silver toddy-jug,
which, bearing the appropriate inscription, “We won't go home till
morning,” will be duly presented to the discriminating magistrate.
We are also happy to state, that under the immediate direction of
MR. JARDINE, a painter has orders to execute a notice in letters of
gold (with a beautiful vine-leaf border) to be placed above the magis-
trate of Queen-square. The notice runs as follows:–

PUNCH TO LORD BROUGHAM.
My Lord,
I am a sincere admirer of your great and versatile abilities. I
know, my Lord, what comparisons are said to be ; and I am aware that
your Lordship is a nonsuch.
Among the characteristics of your lordship, one of the most prominent
is that of always having something to say. And very pleasant it is to
hear you, for your speeches are, at the least, as amusing as they are
instructive. But talking, my lord, takes time. Lord Cottenham, the
other day, brought in a bill for the Abolition of Imprisonment for Debt.
Your Lordship said something on the subject which induced him to post-
pone its discussion for a fortnight, in order that at the end of that time
he might hear what you had further to say upon it. Whether that will
be anything at all to the purpose, your lordship best knows.
Great talents, my Lord, unfortunately directed, are mischievous. I
will not for a moment accuse you of interrupting the business of the
country; still do you not think it would sometimes go on better if you
held your tongue?
My Lord, I have a notion to propose to you. My observations on the
proceedings of your lordship have convinced me that all you want to keep
you quiet is something to do. It must be something worthy of you ;
something that no meaner mind in the whole world would ever dream of
attempting. I would therefore earnestly yet humbly submit to you, as a
suitable occupation, the attempt to discover PERPETUAl Motion; a phe-
nomenon very nearly exemplified in your lordship's tongue; or your
great mathematical attainments might be employed, most auspiciously, in
effecting the QuadRATURE of the Circle.
Your Lordship's most humble servant,
Punch.

MAYORAL FESTIVITIES.
THE Lord Mayor really gave a dinner last week, which has been the sub-
ject of conversation in the City ever since. The entertainments provided
were of the most costly description ; in fact, when we say his Lordship's
hospitality on this occasion even surpassed itself, we feel we have said
everything the most extravagant praise can say. We have been favoured
by the mayoral chºf de cuisine, with the following carte of the provisions:–

The dessert was on an equally liberal scale, consisting of all the delicacies
of the season, amongst which a plate of St. Michael's, a pint of Barcelona's,
and two dishes of mixed biscuits, were the most conspicuous. Chicory
was served up at seven. and the company broke up directly after.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY (VERY) EXTRAORDINARY.
The Bankrupt in this case had incurred liabilities to the extent of nearly
150,000l., by taking money from different parties to invest, and investing
the same in his own pocket. He had regularly paid the interest up to the
day of the issuing of the fiat, that suspicion should not be excited.
A barrister appeared on the part of a creditor who had entrusted
money to the bankrupt several years ago, to buy an annuity, which had
never been made over to him.
SIR C. F. Williams asked if the creditor had been in a state of mes-
merism all that time. (Laughter.)
The Counsel explained, that the bankrupt being the attorney of the
creditor, the latter thought he could place confidence in the former.
SIR. C. F. Williams shook his head for several minutes. He, SIR. C.
F. Williams, thought it a decided case of good-natured laches (a laugh).
Laches was a funny word. It was a word, at least, that might sound
funnily in the ears of strangers; but it was a legal term for neglect :
and while he, SiR C. F. Williams, presided in that Court, he would use
the words most suited to the dignity of the judicial office. If a client
would be guilty of laches, he must expect an attorney to be guilty of
roguery. It was enough to tempt transgression.
An attorney present complained of the conduct of one individual being
made to reflect on the whole profession.
SIR C F. Williams (angrily). I sit here as a judge in this court. I
latest accounts
am always anxious to assist investigation, when I think investigation can
do good. While I sit here—at least, while I walk up and down here—
which I have a habit of doing—I will fulfil my duty. If anybody disputes
my right to do that I will call the Usher and have him committed.
The creditors' counsel said he was anxious to have the facts gone into,
and the case of Mrs. Trott was mentioned.
SiR C. F. Williams said he felt deeply for the Trott family, yet
he (SIR. C. F. Williams) could see very easily that the Trotts had
also been guilty of laches. (A laugh.) SiR C. F. WiLLIAMs wished he
knew who laughed. It was a horrid thing to see respectable men—men
who had lived in good style and enjoyed a good income brought up
before him under circumstances of a suspicious nature. He felt for those
men. He could allow for human infirmity. No man was perfect. He
(SIR. C. F. Williams) was not (A laugh).
SIR. C. F. Williams said the bankrupt could of course clear himself if
he could ; but if he could not, it would be impossible.
The bankrupt wished the creditors to meet him in an annicable spirit.
SIR. C. F. Williams would like to see matters amicably arranged in all
cases if possible. He sat there as a harbinger of peace.
A creditor complained that it was hard to be asked to be amicable after
having been cruelly plundered.
SIR. C. F. WILLIAMs thought that a very harsh and unnecessary remark.
It was then agreed that a private inquiry should take place, and the
proceedings were adjourned.
THE STATUE OF BYRON
TO THE DEAN
AND CHAPTER OF WESTMINSTER.
Custom-House Vaults, May 6, 1844.
EveREND SIRs,
Some four or five years have passed
since—arrived from Italy, where I was cut
by my friend Thorwaldsen—I have lain
in this dungeon. For a long time after my
arrival the place was daily fumigated, lest
any moral infection should escape me; and
only men of the purest and most stedfast
virtue were suffered to descend into my
vault. The authorities believed that I filled
it with the most pestilential principles, and
therefore always made the men bring down
with them some of Robert Montgom ERY's
poems by way of safety-lamp. Owing to this
precaution, the rectitude of the people of the
Customs—it is a truth now known to all the
world—has triumphed over every temptation.
Gentlemen, I was originally chiselled for the Church—carved for
Westminster's old abbey. And yet, up to this moment, you have
denied me admittance therein, doubtless from the sincere belief
that I should corrupt the virtuous company already there assembled.
Gentlemen, let us calmly discuss the matter together.
Who shall I find to spoil The virtuous and orthodox Duke of

Perhaps the fair APHARA BEHN, whose plays are a model for the
pure and young, might be corrupted Or it may be that WILLIAM
Congr Eve might be shocked by my free discourse ; or possibly
MAT PRIon take injury; or the unsophisticated mind of John GAY
be tainted ; or there is the innocent BRIN's LEY SHERIDAN–or more
delicate than all—there is the pious SAMUEL Foot E ;—honoured
dwellers in the Abbey, payers of fees for their lodging. Do you fear
that I should lead them from the paths of innocence and peace by
the freedom of my discourse, and the subtle insinuation of my wit?
—why gentlemen, even should I attempt the wickedness, have you
not Addison and Isaac WATTs there, -besides, I know not how
many churchmen, to reprove me !
But, reverend sirs, let us come to the serious, money part of the
question. As public exhibitors it behoves you to keep up your
attractions. You know too well—all the world knows, by the Par-

liamentary returns—that as a show, Westminster Abbey is every
day becoming less and less profitable. There are many causes that
will account for this. In the first place, there are the Zoological Gar-
dens: the people there are always adding to their stock; importing a
Chimpanzee, or breeding a Giraffe, whilst you never think of adding
to your poets; whilst you have suffered me to remain in darkness,
altogether unwarned by the decreasing threepences !
Reverend sirs, you must march with the spirit of the day. You
must, indeed. The people at the aforesaid Zoological collections
turn a handsome penny, I am told, by letting the town in at feeding
time. If, now, you would consent to dine in public, and now and
then invite a bishop or two to feed in Poets' Corner—I think the
exhibition might draw. The poorer sort of people might like to
see how Bishops and Deans and Chapters feed—the lowliness of
the repast would, doubtless, teach them contentment. This hint
is, I own, away from the purpose of my letter; but it was always
the weakness of my nature to obtrude benevolent advice. To return
to my first purpose. -
How can you longer refuse to take me in Depend upon it, for a
time at least, I should be popular. I am sure I should bring in the
halfpence—a point which, as thorough-going, honest tradesmen, you
cannot, with credit to yourselves, neglect.
Feeling certain that this argument must have its force, I shall
every minute expect to be sent for. Understand, I do not mind
where you put me, so not by the side of GARRick, Cibber, or any
other player; my morals having been considerably improved by my
long acquaintance with the virtuous people of the Custom-house.
Yours, $32?tº.
P.S.. I shall have no objection—if you think it will ensure the safety of
the other folks in Poets' Corner—to wear a camphor-bag about my neck,
and to permit the Dean to sluice me once a day with hot vinegar.

A RARE NEW BALLAD OF MALBROOK,
Cd a $22m Cune.
To BE SUNG AT wooDSTOCK, AT THE ELECTION DINNERS THERE.
Last evening I did sup at Joy's Hotel, And, all unheeding of the Proctor's
Where, to the merry clinking of ban,
To famous Woodstock town had
the can,
Great Evans (who can troll the cho- driven my tan-
rus well Dem, and was strolling upon Blen-
heim sward:
Whom should I see approach but
Blenheim's Lord.
He, too, the tune I heard at Joy's
began,
And thus he sung—
the
Gudu OTU (Englisi) &rntleman.
Did sing “ the Good Old English
Gentleman.”
A gallant song it is, of moral plan,
And somehow always makes my bo-
som swell.
Strange visions in my sleep that
evening ran :
I was again a boy of Oxenford,
I'll sing you a good old song, about England's days of splendour:
John Churchill was the famous Duke that did our race engender,
And as he beat the French, and was our country's best defender,
Why he took money from Queen Anne and likewise from the Pretender.
Like a brave old English nobleman,
Of the good old honest time.
Lord, Lord, it is a dreadful thing to think what my sires got thro' in
A century or so of reckless life, and made extravagant doing ;
With building, racing, dicing, eating, drinking courting, Jewing,
They emptied Great John Churchill's bags, and left poor me to ruin.
Those brave old English noblemen, &c.
This nation was ungrateful, and so I plainly tell them,
Why give us Churchill's park of trees, and then not let us fell them?
Why give us gold and silver plates, and then not let us sell them
Plate we had, but mutton and beef we could very seldom smell them.
We poor old English noblemen, &c.
As the people treated us so base, why it is my maxim,
Whenever I get a poor man down, never to relax him ;
Whenever I have a tenant safe, how I squeeze and tax him ;
Whenever he will not pay his rent, I sells him up and racks him.
Like a true old English nobleman, &c.
My ancestors an almshouse built —(the greater asses they)
For a score of poor old women, as could eat but couldn't pay ;
And they used to come and crawl about, in my great park way:
Hang their eyes } like so many flies, all in the sunshine gay !
What a sight for an English nobleman. &c.
Their rags and wrinkles made me sick, as sure as I wear ermine ;
To turn them out of Blenheim Park I graciously did determine ;
So I bricked the Almshouse gate up, and I read my keepers a sermon :
Says I, No more let into my door that poor old crawling vermin
For I'm a true old English nobleman, &c.
There was John BARTLET,” who picked up a half-eaten rabbit--
How dared John BARtlet for to venture for to go for to grab it?
I sent him to Oxford Gaol because he dared to nab it.
No more, I warrant you, he’ll indulge in that there villanous habit,
And steal from an English nobleman, &c.
Before he went to Oxford Gaol, this BARTLET had the cholera.
I promise you, when he came out, his cheeks looked paler and hollorer.
Fourteen days he lay in gaol, his conduct was intolera-
Ble; and such as practices vice will rue it if they foller her,
Says a moral old English nobleman, &c.
There was John HARRIs,” too ; and sir, what d'ye think,
He was a-riding on his old horse, and actually gave him drink–
Gave him drink in Woodstock Pond, at which I could not wink ;
For I am Lord of Woodstock Town, and will suffer no such think,
As sure as I'm a nobleman, &c.
The parker might have let him off, but I was firm to hold out,
I committed and fined him myself, and so his goods were sold out,
Ruined he was and turned out of doors, with nought to keep the cold out,
And the knackers got his silly old horse, and so John Harris was bowled out
By a true old English nobleman.
So now let's sing God save the king, and the house of bold Malbrook,
Take this here example, rogues, of a gallant English Duke,
And voters all of Woodstock, let all grumbling be forsook,
And let my son the Marquis, for your parliament-man be took.
For he's a true young English nobleman,
And loves the olden time.

ſ
Your first consideration before marriage was,
how to please your lover. Consider any such
endeavour, after marriage, to be unnecessary and
ridiculous; and, by way of amends for your former
labour, let your sole object be, to please yourself.
Be at no pains to look well of a morning. A long
toilet is tiresome; particularly when it is cold.
“Taking the hair out” occupies nearly ten minutes;
come down to breakfast, therefore, in curl papers;
also in a flannel dressing-gown; and, unless you
expect callers, remain in deshabille all day. Hus-
bands are nobodies, and comfort is to be studied
before appearance.
But are you to neglect your attire altogether i
By no means. Indulge your taste in dress to the
utmost. Be always buying something new ; never mind the expense of
it. Payments belong to husbands. If you see a shawl or bonnet in a
window, order it. Should a silk or a muslin attract your eye, desire it
to be sent home. Does a feather, a ribbon, a jewel, strike your fancy 1
purchase it instantly. If your husband is astonished at the bill, pout; if
he remonstrates, cry. But do not spoil your finery by domestic wear.
Reserve it for promenades and parties. It is the admiration of society
that you should seek for, not your husband's. -
Be constantly seeing tables, chairs, window curtains, and other furni-
ture which you like better than your own ; and insist upon their being got.
Want to get rid of your old piano, and have a new one. If your husband
keeps a carriage for you, desire a better ; if he does not, and cannot afford
it, complain. Whenever your desires exceed his means, look unhappy,
and hint how much more advantageously you might have married. Never
smile and hope for better things, but make your husband feel, as keenly
as you can, the inadequacy of his means to "Pºº you.
Practise, however, a reasonable economy. Take every opportunity of
making a cheap purchase; and when asked of what use it is reply, that
it is “a bargain.” -
Enjoy ill health. Be very nervous: and, in particular, subject to fits;
which you are to fly into as often as your husband is unkind, that is,
whenever he reasons with you. Make the most of every little ache or
pain; and insist upon having a fashionable physician. There is something
mºrrºmiſt
*~
º
s
Mw.
very elegant in illness; a prettiness in a deli-
cate constitution—affect this attraction if you
have it not—men admire it exceedingly.
Put yourself under no restraint in your hus-
band's presence Sit, loll, or lie, injust what
way you like, looking only to the ease of the pos-
ture, not to its grace. Leave niceties of con-
versation and sentiment to the single; never
mind how you express yourself; why should
wives be particular hen your husband
wishes to read or be quiet, keep chattering to
him ; the more frivolous and uninteresting
the subject, the better. If he is disposed for
conversation, be dull and silent: and when-
ever you see that he is interested in what he
is talking about, especially if he wishes you to attend to him, keep
yawning.
There are two ways of discharging your household duties. If you are
languid and listless, you may let them alone : if not able, you should be
continually turning the house topsy-turvy, under pretence of setting it to
rights. You can either let your servants do just as they please; or you may
be continually in the kitchen, looking after them. In the latter case, scold
them frequently, and in an audible voice, so as to be heard up-stairs.
Never think of looking to your husband's shirt buttons; leave that to the
laundress; or, if you must attend to his linen, superintend your washing
in person, and have frequent water-parties; and, especially in winter,
always have the clothes dried before the parlour fire.
If your husband has to go out to a business-dinner, or to the play, never
let him have the latch-key; and should he, on any occasion, stay out late,
send the servant to bed, sit up for him yourself, and make a merit of the
sacrifice to “the wretch.”
Have a female confidant, who will instruct you in all the ill qualities of
husbands generally, and will supply any deficiencies in the above hints.
In conclusion, bear these grand principles in mind—that men must be
crossed and thwarted continually, or they are sure to be tyrants; that a
woman, to have her rights, must stand up for them ; and that the
behaviour, which won a man's affections, is by no means necessary to
preserve them.
Guildingll Toasts.
At the late dinner given by the Lord Mayor to the Bench of Bishops,
MR. ALDERMAN Gibbs, by virtue of his virtues, enjoyed a very con-
spicuous place. On the “Memory of Cocken" being proposed by the
City Chamberlain, and drunk in solemn silence, MR. ALDERMAN Gibbs
returned thanks for the departed arithmetician.
SCIENTific intelligence.
We understand that the Lord Mayor intends taking out a patent for an
invention for the cure of Smoky Chimnies. The experiment has been
tried very successfully at the Mansion House, the chimnies of which have
hardly been seen to smoke at all during the last six months.
Extraordinary Coincidence 1
On the very evening that Lond CAMPBELL's Bill for the Entire Aboli-
tion of Arrest for Debt was read a second time in the House of Lords,
swarms of rats were seen to leave every sponging-house in the metropolis.
The next morning bows of black crape were observed at the topmost bars
of such domiciles, and several distinguished Sheriff's Officers appeared in
the streets in deep mourning.
Musical Intelligence.
We are told by the papers that MR. Balfe has had an interview with
Louis-Philippe, who complimented him very highly on the success of the
Bohemian Girl. Thus it appears, if British musicians would be patro-
nised by royalty, they must quit England and go to France.
WANT PLACES.
The MAN and the Boy from the works in Trafalgar Square. They can
have a fourteen years' character from their last place, and are willing to
make themselves, generally useless. Having come down in the world—
from the top of the Nelson Column—is the only reason for inserting this

GREAT MEETING OF SHERIFFS OFFICERS ON
LORD CAMPBELL’S BILL.
EDNEsday last a meeting
of Sheriffs’ Officers was
held at the Fleece, for the
| purpose of taking into con-
sideration the injurious
tendency of Lond CAMP-
BELL’s Bill, now before
- Parliament; a Bill which,
if matured into an Act, will entirely
abolish imprisonment for debt, and
thereby strike a fatal blow at the
interests of a most meek and self-
denying race of men, the servants of
the Sheriff. The room was crowded
by officers distinguished for their
service, together with their humbler
followers and meaner dependants.
Mr.Solomon, amidst great applause,
was called to the Chair.
The ChalamAN, with the choicest
flow of language, and with that
elegance of manner which could
only be acquired from a long and intimate knowledge of the aristo:
cracy, opened the business of the day. He called upon those about
ings; drew son so close to father—brother to brother For instance;
the son, a wine-merchant, at some hundred per cent, did the bill ;
this he paid to his brother, the attorney, who employed his father,
the bum-bailiff, who employed another son, broker and auctioneer,
to walk in and sell up. Then a debtor, every bit of him, might be
devoured by a whole family, and not a small bone to spare for any-
body else. But only pass CAMPBELL's Bill, and what’s the debtor
worth Nothing, except to his creditors; they get all he has, and
the lawyer and the bailiff are robbed and bamboozled. (Loud cheers.)
He remembered the time when a sheet of paper sold in a spunging-
house for a shilling. Now, the same article was to be had for two-
pence. (Shame 1) He would propose that the Duke of WELLING-
toN should be entrusted with their petition; his Grace having, with
that large humanity which distinguished his statemanship, actually ad-
vised a remuneration for Sheriffs' Officers on the passing of a previous
act. Mr. Lazarus concluded by moving the second resolution.
MR. Cox was only too happy to second the resolution. The
Bill was a most mischievous and wicked Bill, for it went to suppress,
if not entirely to destroy, the best feelings of human nature.
(Hear, hear.) He would prove it. For instance, you locked a man
up, and if he himself had nothing, why, nine times out of ten, his
imprisonment was made a tax upon his relatives and friends, who
then, at any cost, came forward to help him. Abolish arrest for
debt, and these beautiful feelings are suffered to sleep, unknown to
all parties. Hence, the Act contemplated by Lord CAMPBEll
was a wrong done upon the human heart. It was smothering its
noblest emotions. (Hear, hear.) The question to be resolved was
this :—Were the expenses now paid to the Sheriff and his officer to
swell the funds for the mere creditor? If such was to be the case,
England would no longer be the home for the noble and the free.
him to be up and doing. Lord Campbell's Bill menaced, their
very existence as men, as citizens, as wine-merchants, as coal-mer-
chants, as money-scriveners. If they loved their homes
—if they valued the sanctity of their bankers' books-
if they would not see the bars at their windows made
worthless old iron by Lord CAMPBELL–they would de-
feat so base, so unholy a tampering with a time-honoured
law, (cheers)—a law under which the British Constitu-
tion had attained its present palmy condition—a law
under which Eldon had grown gray and a Wellington
had conquered 1 (Vehement cheers.)
MR. Levi rose to move the first resolution. He said
they had borne more than enuff. Bit by bit hall their
profits had been cut hoff; and now they vos threatened
to be done hup entirely. He vos a young man he vos,
but he vos hold enough to remember the days when an
onesthofficer could make his twenty pounds afore break-
fast, by bail-bonds. Them days vos gone—(Groans)—
gone for hever. He eld it for a truth that the law of
arrest vos to society vot an oop vos to a cask; it eld it
together; take away the oop, and wouldn't there be a
tumblin about of the staves 1 (Loud cheers.) . Load
CAM Phell had a good deal to answer for. (Hear) How
he could sleep on his pillar with that Bill in his ed, he
(MR. Lev 1) couldn't tell. Some men, however, had no
art; and he was afeared Lohn CAMPBELL vos one on
'em. (Cries of “He his—he his.”) The Bill vos a great
blow at public credit. (Hear.) For how, he should like
to know, would anybody trust anybody if he couldn't
have the pleasure of locking him up Lond CAMPBELL’s
Hact would make bill-stamps vaste-paper—vould hutterly
destroy the discount trade, and make the veeds grow in
the court-yard of the Halbany 1 (Cries of “Shame,” and
“We won't stand it tº) The doing avay with arrest on
Mesne Process vos bad enuff; but let Lord CAMPBEll
carry his Bill, and adoo to the onest profits of the hindustrious hofficer
—adoo to the vine-trade—adoo to the coal-business—adoo to every-
thing. He saw nothin afore 'em but to go down to the lowest pint of
hinfamy, and keep a play-house. (Sensation.)
MR. NATHAN briefly seconded the resolution. He would bleed in
defence of the law as it existed ; and he knew very well—no man
better—what bleeding was .
Mr. LAzap us, an elderly gentleman of venerable aspect, and very
Roman nose, next addressed the meeting. He had been door-keeper
for twenty years at a most distinguished spunging-house in Newman
Street; a house made celebrated by the men who had enjoyed its
hospitality. IIa the happy, blissful days he had spent there in the
good old times of Ellen honough and ELDon . Then, law was a
manly sport, and worth something; now it was nothing but child's

Other distinguished officers severally addressed the auditory,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EXETER HALL PETS.
Religion, like fancy, has her peculiar favourites. Ladies and
gentlemen have, among the various heathen, their pet proselytes, just
as among birds and dogs they have their pet macaws, their pet
poodles. It is an adage old as Truth—whose register of birth was not
lost at the Flood—that the human heart must love something: hence,
beautiful is it, in this balmy month of May, to see crowds of lovers—
spiritual lovers we mean—ascending the crystal steps of Exeter Hall
to testify their affection for the benighted sons and daughters of
earth thousands and thousands of miles away. Elastic, indeed, are
human heart-strings, for they stretch from pole to pole. Indeed, with
many of the worthy people of Exeter Hall, distance is essential to
love. Just as connoisseurs take a backward step truly to consider
the beauties of a picture, do many of these good folks require distance
to see the miseries of human nature through an attractive medium.
They have no taste for the destitution of the alley that abuts upon
their dwelling-place, but how they glow—how they kindle at the
misery somewhere in Africal Familiarity truly begets contempt.
The famishing shoe-binder or sempstress is a homely commonplace;
the benighted Chinese an exotic darling. With some folks sympathy,
like Madeira, is all the better for a sea-voyage.
We have said that proselyte-mongers have their special pets:
Among them, the Hebrew people bear a great price. Hence, as was
shewn at a late meeting, upwards of £25,000 are annually subscribed
for the conversion of the Jews at Jerusalem, Hebron, Beyrout, Con-
stantinople, Smyrna, and we know not at how many other places pro-
mising in apostacy. We must confess, we should like to see a fair
balance-sheet of this account. We should like to know the exact
number of converted Hebrews, that we might arrive at something
like the market-price of a renegade Jew. We own it; we more than
fear that he is a great luxury ; a bird of Paradise of exceeding cost.
Hence, we confess it, we would have our gentle countrywomen re-
trench their outlay on the foreign curiosity, that they might better
afford to buy up somewhat of the misery produced at home.
A day or two after the meeting was held of these benevolent people,
whose hearts yearn for the Jews in Sapet and Strasburg, there ap-
peared in the papers—but then the tragedy happened at No. 1, Angel-
court, Long-acre, not a quarter of a mile from Exeter Hall—an account
of the death of one MARY WALL, aged 35. She died famished.
John Bitton, of St. Martin's workhouse, testified as follows:–
“On opening the door of a room on the ground-floor, or, more properly s eaking, a
lumber-room, there being no fluor to it, he found the deceased lying on her face on the
earth, her body covered with shapings, and her head resting on part of an old basket simi-
lar to a wine-merchant's hamper. She was groaning, and seemed quite insensible.”
Mr. Leonah.D, surgeon to the out-door poor of St. Martin's,
deposed :—
“On being taken to the workhouse, remedies were used to restore animation; but she
never rallied, and died within twenty-four hours after. The place where deceased dwelt
emitted a most noisome smell, from the quantity of decayed garden-stuff. on making a
post-mortem examination, he ſound inflammation of both lungs, which no doubt arose
from the non-application for medical assistance; which, together with her not receiving
any domestic comforts, and lying on the bare and coid ground alone and neglected,
produced extreme erhaustion, of which she died.”
It must, however, be allowed that the death of the woman was
doubtless accelerated by her determination not to go into the work-
house; nevertheless, had we societies as actively benevolent in the
Angel-courts of London and our great towns as in Constantinople
and Smyrna—had we home missionaries of charity to tempt the
fetid dangers of Seven Dials and Spitalfields, could these scenes of
horror be enacted But then there is this bar to the zeal of the
philanthropic—both Seven Dials and Spitalfields are close at hand;
they are real, tangible foulness; the eye turns from them—the nostrii
shrinks at them; whilst what a picturesqueness invests Constantinople
—what a halo of beauty does distance cast about Jerusalem I
Again; consider the great difference between the objects to be
succoured. The dwellers of English lanes and alleys are common,
vulgar things: creatures of foul and violent speech ; commonplace
in their very rags and ghastliness. But the Jews—the spiritually
forlorn of Jerusalem / Oh, the Evangelical imagination clothes them
with the mystic beauty of the place; uplifts and sublimates them by
the magic of religious fervour, and the very tatters of the Hebrew
become rare and beautiful as Joseph's coat of many colours. And
so, soft-hearted ladies and gentlemen, rapt by the forlornness of the
far-off Jew, write their cheques, or put their money in the plate, too
deliciously possessed by the sweet apostate in the distance ever to
dream of the famishing Christian at their right hand. Could we but
transport our destitute population to China or to Africa, we have no
doubt that many English Samaritans would then be marvellously
piteous of them. Oh, ye miserable Christians, who hunger and
waste unvisited in English lanes and cellars, why are ye not Jews,
glorified by distance, dwelling at Beyrout and Hebron 1
Even religion to some people is more attractive when invested
with a certain air of romance. The modern missionary is, to some
folks, picturesque as was the Templar Knight of old. To be sure, he
goes not forth to slay the unbeliever; but—happier condition of the
world—to make proselytes. He carries neither sword nor spear,
but hard cash, with which he turns the heart of the needy Hebrew,
and writes home “a soul saved.” And every gentlewoman who gives
a guinea to the goodly fund is softened and upraised by the thought
that she has her soldier of peace fighting in Palestine ; and with
such sufficing belief she may give a chicken wing to Bijou her dog
even though a Christian mother shall whine with hunger at her gate.
On the last meeting of the Society in question, the Bishop of
WINchest ER preached a sermon. Eloquent no doubt was the dis-
course; heart-touching, pocket-penetrating. We would, however,
that his Grace—if only for one round — would visit the Angel-
courts of London : the pilgrimage might, we think, give an impetus
to the sluggish imaginations of those who think that true misery,
real mental darkness, is only to be found, like their fine hyson, in a
far country.
Allowing, however, that it is necessary to the apoplectic philan-
thropy of some folks to bleed their purses for the heathen, we think
that at least the Jews might be left as they are until every other
unbeliever should be converted.
Here, madam,-you, who at the last meeting invested five
pounds in apostate Jews, – here is the map of the world. Cast
your eye over it. Here is the poor Esquimaux doomed to whale-
blubber and a soul-blighting creed—here the Red Man—here the
Hottentot–here the New Zealander—here people on people, and
tribe on tribe, all in uttermost darkness. Enlighten them, and then,
if you will, begin with the Hebrew. Meanwhile, for ourselves—we
confess it—we have more than a sneaking respect for a people who
had Moses for a leader and a law-giver. We rarely meet a long-
bearded Rabbi that he does not carry our thoughts to the plains of
Mamre—to the first patriarchs of the first nation.
And ye, who would convert the Jews, first copy the Jews' great
virtue: first take care of your own poor; feed and clothe them, and then,
if you will, with the superfluity make proselytes of the Hebrew.
Meanwhile, with misery wasting thousands of our fellow-Christians
at our very doors, we hold the subscription of large sums of money
for, at best, the questionable conversion of the Jew, as the offering of
a miserable, morbid egotism; and should still think so of the purpose,
though the whole Bench of Bishops wagged their silver tongues in
Q.
aid of it.
MY WIFE'S DIARY.
Now, PUNCH, I am a married man. Yesterday
I found a little note-book in the passage.
It turned out, on inspection, to be my wife's;
and to contain—what think you !—a journal;
which that woman has been keeping, I dare
say, ever since, our marriage. The ensuing
is an extract therefrom. Punch, you are a
gentleman ; and, therefore, I hope you will
insert it. If you were a lady, indeed, I
imagine you hardly would ; besides, I should
wish no lady to take a leaf out of my wife's
book. Here, however, sir, is one, at your
service :—
“Sunday.—Charles out late last night;
not up this morning till twelve: breakfast
not over till one. Wished particularly to go
to church; my new lilac bonnet with pink trimmings came home yesterday.
Couldn't go, of course. The WAlkers and the Hutchinses there, and all 1
Very angry with Charles ; wouldn't talk to him at dinner : went up after-
wards into the dressing-room, and there sat by myself. When I came down
again, found him smoking and reading the paper. That Edwards called
this evening. Knew Charles would ask him to stay to supper. Slipped
out directly after tea; locked the larder, took the key of the cellar, and
went to bed: hope they were comfortable 1
Monday.—Charles very cross this morning about last night; but
coaxed him over, and made him promise me that dear shawl. Paid for
week's housekeep. Mem.—to get those open-work stockings. Charles
out at half-past ten. MRs. SAUNDERs called. How well she manages
SAUNDERs 1 Mem.—not to forget her hint about the save in sugar.
Charles home again, for a wonder, at four ; said he had been for a walk
with BRADSHAw. Steaks for dinner. Charles never asked me what cut

I would like; contradicted me about the horse-radish, when I knew I was
*: and would eat spring onions with his cream-cheese when l told
im not.
Tuesday.—Charles up in his little room, writing, all day. Went out
shopping with Susan and the baby. Ordered the brown sugar instead of
the lump, and put by the difference for sundries. Got the dear shawl. Met
the WELLses, and heard that Mr. Charles was seen yesterday at the
Pantheon; what did he want there I should like to know (Mem.—to find
out). After dinner (shoulder of mutton), Charles reading. Baby cried.
Charles wanted it sent up-stairs: how very unreasonable –the poor dear
was teething—wouldn't hear of such a thing. Charles went out in a tiff,
and never came home again till two in the morning. Said he had been
kept up talking over business. Business, indeed His eyes were so red,
and he smelt so dreadfully of cigars . The cold shoulder of mutton for
you, sir, to-morrow /
Wednesday.—My lord wanted soda-water this morning. In his tan-
trums at breakfast, because there were no bloaters.—Went out directly
after. Asked him if he was going to the Pantheon 2–took no notice :-
oh, I am afraid he is very sly Ordered the cold shoulder and no rice-
pudding to-day ; bought the stockings. Home came Charles to dinner
with a friend; so vexed about the bill of fare: serve him right !
Thursday.—Charles away again early, told me not to wait for him.
Nice lamb chops, all alone, at two. Charles back at half-past twelve ;
saw a play-bill hanging out of his pocket: and taxed him ; when he admit-
ted he had been to Drury Lane. Why couldn't he have taken me?
Friday.—He wanted half-a-dozen pocket-handkerchiefs, and gave me
the money for them. Got him four—quite enough for him. Bought a
nice cardinal. Saw such a love of a work-box in a shop in Regent Street
—five guineas l—oh, how my fingers itched for it. Charles this afternoon
in a good humour; gave him a broad hint about the work-bor. I shall
et it.
g Saturday.—Charles scolding this morning about his wristbands, which
had no buttons. Sewed them on myself, and pacified him. Asked him if
he would like to dine out to-day ; said, No: how provoking 1 for I wanted
to spend the day at Mrs. Hopkins's. Had a few words about the mutton,
whether it should be boiled or roast : but thought it best to give way.
Surprised him at dinner with College dumplings—my own making. Mixed
him a nice glass of brandy and water afterwards. Got the work-bor.”
There, Punch. I am already your debtor for many a good joke;
increase the obligation by one more; that of letting me show my wife the
above in print. I am, &c.,
BENEDICrus.
THE ADVENT OF THE SPRING.
The honey-bee begins to work,
The thrush and blackbird sing ;
Flowers, leaves, and sunshine, all proclaim
The Advent of the Spring.
In London we've no honey-bee—
No song-bird sings to us;
But have we not the melody
Of the Blue-bottle's buzz
The chandlers' and the butchers' shop,
Enlivened by his humming,
Proclaims sufficiently the fact,
That Summer's come, or coming.
He flits through groves of moulds and dips,
And climbs o'er hills of beef;
Now perches on my lady's nose,
To give his wings relief.
He sips from rivulets of beer,
On tap-room tables streaming;
Then takes a turn in Regent Street,
And bathes some dandy's cream in.
Let others sing the flowers of Spring,
And green-wood melody
Confound the fly—he's in my eye l
No Blue-bottles for me !
THE BANKING OF THE THAMEs.
We understand that SIRVAlentine Blake will bring forward in con-
nection with SIR. R. Peel's resolutions on banking the very interesting
subject of The Banking of the Thames—SIR VALENTINE will, we believe,
inquire whether the Thames will always keep a balance, and if so, how
the tides may operate to render its transactions unsteady.

GAMBLERS 1
CAPTURE EXTRAORDINARY 1
7. EstERDAY, the neighbourhood of our
(police) office was in an extraordinary
state of excitement; it having been
understood that that very vigilant section
of the force, Letter A., had on the pre-
vious night succeeded in forcing an entry
into a well-known house, known as
Crockford's, and capturing some dozen
peers, and at least as many commoners
of distinction, all of them unlawfully
assembled for the purpose of beggaring
themselves and families, by means of
cards and dice. It appeared that the
house had long given great offence to
many virtuous shopkeepers in the neigh-
bourhood, and last night was selected as the happy time for the
abatement of the nuisance.
There were in all five-and-twenty prisoners ; amongst whom we
noticed the Duke of Fou RHoNors, the Marquis of Cut AcE, the
Earl of Rouge, Viscount No1 it, Baron JAcques O'SPADE, Sir Harry
FINEFINGER, the Count SAut ERLEcoup, Charles Roulett E, Esq.,
and others well known to the “play” world. The prisoners having
been kept in the watchhouse all night, did not when brought up show
to the best advantage. However, true to the fine instinct of aris-
tocratic blood, they put a bold face on the matter, and looked loftily,
contemptuously around them, as they were brought up in pairs, and
put to the bar, to answer for the misdemeanour.
John SMITH, policeman, deposed that he had the previous night
effected an entrance into the house through the drawing-room
window. Other policemen burst in at the doors: they all rushed to
the play-room, where they found the Duke of Founhonons and the
Earl of Rouge playing with dice; the other prisoners were grouped
about the table, playing a game with cards. On seeing the police,
the prisoners attempted to escape, but were seized. Two packs of
cards (they were produced) were found in the Duke of Foun honon’s
pocket; his grace swore very singular oaths on being searched. Sir
Harry FINEFINGER attempted to swallow a couple of dice, but was
prevented by Serjeant Quick grasping Sir HARRY's throat; where-
upon, Sir HARRY spat them out upon a salver.
SAMUEL Biggs, another policeman, corroborated the foregoing
testimony. Indeed, the evidence left no shadow of doubt as to the
object of all the prisoners at the time of their capture.
All the prisoners were fined in the highest sum permitted by the
statute; and having paid the penalties, departed homeward in their
carriages.
By a curious coincidence several lower gambling-houses were
entered on the same evening by the police ; and a host of their
inmates taken the next morning before Mr. HARDwick at Marl-
borough Street, who fined them accordingly. Thus, it is delightful
to reflect that the same watchful spirit which is active to destroy the
lower hells, like that of “the Nick, 16}, Castle Street,” is no
respecter of place or persons, but breaks into CRockford's, and
captures dukes and lords. The impartiality of justice in this matter
warms the heart of every true-born Briton 1
Epidemic among the London Clocks.
We have heard from several quarters of the metropolis, that the
extraordinary malady which so long afflicted the clock of St. Clement's
has extended to several others of the church dials of London. An East-
end clock, whose name we are in possession of – a clock that has for some
years occupied a high position in the City, in fact, Shoreditch—has, we re-
gret to say, been seized with the same distressing symptoms as those from
which St Clement's Clock is still slowly recovering. The unhappy dial has
lost the use of both hands, and gives every indication of falling into a state
of hopeless derangement. Many of the neighbours have for some time
suspected it was “not quite right,” and we are sorry to say that their
worst fears are now confirmed. It was painful to observe the anxiety
with which several persons who appeared most interested in its fate
remained with their eyes fixed on its face, in the hope of even the
slightest change, but all in vain. The unfortunate patient, however, gave
no other indication of its time having come, and no one who looked at it
could, for one moment, have supposed that it was going.

EXTRAORDINARY FEAT OF THE DRIVER OF THE INDIAN MAIL,
A REMARxable experiment was a short time ago attempted panied by his friend the Duke. When they got near the Temple,
by the state coachman of the Queen, who undertook to drive and into the neighbourhood of the Law, they began to snort
four-and-twenty well-trained hacks from the India House, in and to show signs of impatience, but having caught a glimpse of a
Leadenhall Street, to the Treasury. At the appointed hour Peel, Kennington omnibus, with the picture of a tame elephant on one
the coachman, mounted the - box, accom- of the panels and “Elephant and Castle” inscribed above, the
leaders began to plunge in the most desperate manner. The kicking
and rearing became so formidable as to throw the guard of the
vehicle—the Indian Mail—from his seat, and it required all the
strength of PEEL, aided by that of “the Duke,” to prevent a
collision of the most alarming character. At length, however,
having picked up another guard the team became less ungovernable,
and they were at last brought cleverly round, though not till they
had received at the hands of the Duke a pretty severe lashing.
DINNER TO THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL ELECT.
Ose of the principal dishes at this entertainment has
been provided by Sir Robert Peki. It consists, we 22
believe, of a stout and very crusty piece of pastry, called humble pie, which the Directors
will be expected to partake of, in compliment to the Ministry. Punch has had much ſ
Pleasure in forwarding something smart to SIR HENRY HARDINGE, who has been observed to
*y-on being helped to something that may happen to be rather tough—“Really this is as hard
as a board.” This would be a graceful allusion to the injustice of the Board in recalling his
Predecessor, as well as a polite intimation of his own intention to “stand no nonsense.”
-
THE RECALL OF LoRD ELLENBoRough.
It is believed that the Governor-General has had enemies about his household, some of whom were
cognizant of the intention of the Directors to recall him ; for, on his birthday, which recently occurred,
one of his attendants—no doubt, sarcastically—is said to have wished him “ many happy returns.”

OFFICIAL CHANGE.

ENGLAND AND HER BEADLES.
- D very one must be aware that England owes
much of her glory to her Beadlery. The
early Beadle, or Bedell, is a very ancient
officer, and we find traces of him in the time
of Wicklyffe, who talks of that “Jollie olde
dogge ye beedel,” but what were the duties of
the office at that early age we have no means
of arriving at. It is not our intention to take
a comprehensive view of the ancient beadlery,
though there might be a great deal of pleasant
gossip on a subject so suggestive of small
talk and chat. Our present purpose is to
* look at England in relation to beadles present
—not to beadles past, though we may, per-
haps, throw out a few suggestions as to beadles hereafter to come.
It is one of the . facts connected with the streetkeepery of
this metropolis, that it thrives most where it is required least, and it has
been nicely observed by a recent speaker, (a gentleman we dined with the
other day,) that where nature has planted tranquillity, authority has fixed
a streetkeeper. Panton Square, for instance—which is an isolated tract
almost untrodden by the stranger's foot—where such a thing as “a row” is
unknown even to the oldest inhabitant. Panton Square is, nevertheless,
burdened with a beadle, whose only occupation is to watch the setting sun
and count the iron railings, the ºp. the knockers, the bells, and the
flower-pots. Perhaps the flower of English beadlery may be looked for
in the Burlington Arcade, but here also is a limited field for the exercise
of power, for Burlington enjoys a truly Arcadian peacefulness.
But it will be said, while speaking of the beadles that are superfluous,
we are forgetting the beadles that are deficient, and we feel that we ought
not to lose sight of the latter branch of this truly national subject.
In looking at the basins of Trafalgar Square, we at once feel that the
paper and orange peel thrown upon its waters would never be there if
England and her beadles were true to each other, at all times and in all
places. It is true that there is now a policeman on duty to protect the
posts from the desecration to which a juvenile thirst for leapfrog had
originally doomed them, and to save the water from that ignominy
which a national tendency to the game of duck and drake had consigned
it—but still something is wanting. Policemen may frighten the pick-
pockets, sentinels may awe the doers of wilful damage, but for striking
terror into the boys, England must trust only to her beadlery. Trafalgar
Square will never be secure from juvenile desecration. The fountains will
never be free from orange peel, the posts will never be safe from the
boyish bound, until the British beadle is permanently planted on her
massive steps, her expansive area, and her noble borders.
ACT FOR THE AMENDMENT of THE ORTHOGRAPHY
OF SURNAMES.
“ UKäbereas divers and sundry persons, subjects of Her Most Gracious
Majesty, VicroRIA, of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the
Faith, are known, called, and designated by certain surnames, which are
spelt one way and pronounced another; and whereas such names are so
spelt that nobody upon earth could, from their spelling, have the remotest
idea of their pronunciation ; by reason whereof, others, faithful subjects
of Her said Majesty, are continually led into mistakes in the utterance of
them, thereby often giving great offence to their owners, and exposing
themselves unto derision and ridicule, to their no small discomfort and
discomposure of mind; and moreover whereas a great many other incon-
veniences are by the same means occasioned ;
Be it Enacted, That from the passing of this Act, henceforth and for
ever, no Person calling himself Chumley shall spell his name Cholmon-
Dely ; and that all manner of Persons who think proper to spell their
names Cholmondely, shall pronounce their said names, and have them
pronounced of others, precisely as they are spelt; that is to say, as words
of four syllables, with a due and distinct emphasis on each.
And whereas the name of Beauchamp is of French origin, be it further
enacted that the said name shall be sounded of all men as nearly as pos-
sible after the French manner, and shall not be pronounced Beech AM
under any pretence whatever; and that all manner of Persons calling
themselves BeechAM shall write and spell their names, and shall have
them written, and spelt accordingly ; provided always, that in case they
prefer to spell them Beechum, they shall be at liberty so to do.
In like manner, Be it furthER ENACTED, That MAnjohibanks shall be
spelt Manchbanks; WEMyss, WIMs; and Colquhoun, Cohoon ; or if not,
then that they also shall be pronounced as they are spelt, and not in any
other manner. And, furthermore, BE IT ENActed, That all other names
not expressly mentioned in this Act shall be spoken according to their
orthography... And, lastly, Bs it ENACTED, That any person, of what degree
soever, offending against any one of the provisions of this Act, either by
- - →
spelling his own name, or that of any body else, differently from the way
in which he pronounces it, or, by pronouncing it differently from the
manner in which he spells it, shall forfeit for each offence a sum not
exceeding Five Shillings.”
If the above Bill is not likely to do as much good to the country as any
that has been as yet introduced into Parliament this session, Punch will
allow himself to be shot.

IMPERIAL PIG.
We are not particularly nice in our eating, but we would not,
could not, touch or taste Majaletto da latte affumicato.
We are not infirmly delicate in our appetite, or squeamishly
fastidious about dainties; but, stomach or no stomach, we could not,
for our gorge rising, swallow Majaletto da latte affumicato.
We are not of the Hebrew persuasion, with conscientious scruples
against swine's flesh as forbidden fruit; yet, Christian as we are, we
could not for the soul of us relish Majaletto da latte affunicato.
Like Char LEs LAMB we are rather partial to a tender roasted
suckling, well stuffed with sage and mild onion; we like him, flesh,
fat, and crackling, from his crisp ears to his pettitoes. Nevertheless,
we could not feed on Majaletto da latte affumicato.
At a pinch, we could perhaps bring ourselves to dine or sup on
dubious sausages, or equivocal rabbits, but on Majaletto da latte
affumicato, never !
We are, we trust, loyal ; and could eat and drink lustily in honour
of royalty, of the birthday barrels and the bullock whole-roasted in
Bachelor's Acre, but not a morsel could we, would we taste of
Majaletto da latte affumicato.
But what is Majaletto da latte affumicato Let MR. MoREL, of
Piceadilly, answer, by his advertisement of Comestables d’Italie, in the
Morning Herald, of May the First —

“To the last-named article there is an episode attached, which is transcribed here,
such as it comes from Styria. One of the Emperors of Germany, being peaking and
delicate from his birth, was aceustomed for the preservation of his precious life, to have
his body lapped round, and animal-heated several times a day, with a little sucking-pig,
fresh killed, and still warm. The effect of which, it appears, was so wonderful, that he
reigned, a long while, to the glory of his people, and to the great emolument of the

salting and smoking them—so that they were cured as well as the sovereign—and to this
day, in Germany, the Majaletto da latte aſſumicato. royally called Emperor Flesh, often
crowns a pyramid of sour-krout.”
We hardly like to guess when German loyalty went the little pig
in such a nasty manner, how it would have gone the whole hog.

WE regret to observe that the fountains here are exceedingly obstimate,
for they will not work, and they do not play. This seems like a
determination to do neither one thing nor the other. The water in the
basins looked rather muddy, but it is said to be very good water in the
main. We have been told that the funds are at low water-mark, which
accounts for the water being all drained off, so that the funds may be
looked for. There is a good deal of mystery about those basins, of which
we are determined to get to the bottom—if the police will not interfere
with us. Poor Nelson, when he sung out his glorious old bit of claptrap
about England expecting every man to do his duty, little thought how
Fngland would be disappointed by the failure of one man (and one boy)
!o do the duty which would one day devolve upon them.
WRITING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
unch, I am a grave person; a philosopher, Sir; at least I
hope so. I never write nonsense intentionally; but I
lately wrote a piece of very great nonsense uninten-
tionally; and, as I have no other use for it, I beg to
send it to you. I was inditing an essay, Sir, on the
subject of Life: now see what stuff, owing to a cause
which will be apparent on its perusal, I made of it.
I must premise that A. stands for Author—that is to
say, myself; and B. for Bore. Here follows, with
explanatory interpolations,
THE ESSAY.
“The word ‘Life,’” (Here came a tremendous rap,
Jollowed by a violent ring, at the street-door. I
started, spilt my ink, and blotted my paper) “has a

Here it occurred to me just to look over what I had written ; and I
leave you, sir, to imagine the feelings with which I perused the above
jumble. I found it utterly useless to proceed; and accordingly yielded
myself to the infliction of Hawkins, which lasted nearly an hour.
Now, Mr. Punch, I know not whether you find it as difficult to make
jokes under interruption, as I do to write philosophy; if you do, you will
perhaps find your account in publishing this communication, for
Your obedient servant,
VicTime.
WHAT IS A POUND 2
“What is a pound !”
Exclaims the premier, looking round,
And tunefully his accents sounded,
As, of a pound that question he propounded.
“What is a pound !” again SIR Robert cries.
“It much depends,” says Punch, “on where one buys.”
A pound of sugar at some grocer's bought,
Is not a pound at all, but something short.
A tradesman oft, who of low prices bounces,
Deducts an ounce, while full weight he announces.
Who buys street-cherries heavier made by dirt,
Will get what's literally his desert.
A pound to be a pound was never known,
Though every cherry weighs above a stone.
One naturally wonders whether,
There came into the premier's head,
The joke about a pound of feather
Being heavier than a pound of lead.
“What is a pound !” by PEEL we're told
'Tis either silver, or 'tis gold.
But there's a pound distinct from those,
As many a cominon donkey knows,
Who may perchance have patient stood,
Encircled by a pound of wood.

We can now understand why so many illegal acts have of late been
committed by the New Police, for the Globe informs us that sonne attornies

MR. THESIGER'S SPEECH TO THE ELECTORS OF ABINGDON.
By our own Erpress.
No one else being put in nomination, the choice of the electors—
(amid loud cries of “Hobson's ") — was declared to have fallen on
FREDERick Thesiger, Esq., her Majesty's Solicitor-General.
MR. Thesigen then came forward, and said—
“Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,_Utterly unknown as I am to you all
—wholly unacquainted as I am with you and you with me—I feel that I
shall be unfettered by any local prejudice.” (Aside to his Seconder.—
“What the deuce shall I say 1). A-hem—a-hem. In the time of the
early Britons, when the Wittena Gemote held its sittings in the open air;
(loud cheers)—when our fathers, nay our grandfathers, would have laid
down their lives for their Saxon Institutions—then it was—yes then, in
those days, and at that time, that we might have proudly boasted of our
early liberties. (Loud cheers.) Gentlemen, I am a stranger to Abingdon,
I was never here before, and I don't suppose I shall ever be this way
again; but as I go to my Parliamentary duties down Abingdon Street,
the name of Abingdon will kindle in my bosom the flame of remembrance,
and I shall think of you, Gentlemen, who have this day formed between
me and that henceforth cherished street, a series of links that will bind
my heart as firmly—
‘As did the forger Vulcan rivet up
The chains that bound his victim."
(Enthusiastic cheering, during which MR. Thesigen winked at his
seconder, and received on his leg a kick of intelligence from an
intimate friend.)
“Farewell, my friends, for friends I may now truly call you.” (Aside
from his seconder—“Give them another quotation or two, and then wind
it up.”). “Farewell Farewell I Remember me. But I think I hear you
ask me if we shall ever meet again. We shall my friends, we shall. Yes—
“We shall meet again at Phillipi.’”
(Enthusiastic Cheering, amidst which the learned gentleman sat down.)
On proceeding to his hotel, he was met by the printer of his posting
bills, with the proof of a broadside announcing that “F. Thesiger, Esq.,
would, on the – day of meet the worthy and independent electors
of Abingdon at Philippi.”
The Solicitor-General good humouredly ordered and paid for 300, with
directions that they should not be issued or stuck up at present. After a
good supper with the mayor and his seconder, the Solicitor-General
started for London, in order to take his place as the representative of
the means and wishes of the people of Abingdon.
THE SCENE IN THE COURT OF QUEEN’s BENCH
IN DUBLIN.
The Court is open'd—by an earnest throng
The usher, powerless, is borne along.
In vain he strives to swell his weekly salary
By letting strangers up into the gallery,
For long before the bargain can be made
The crowd has broken down the balustrade.
Two judges enter, but no word they say,
Up to the close of the judicial day.
At length another anxious morning comes,
The attorney-general slowly twirls his thumbs,
Fixed in his place the learned martyr lingers,
Anon he pares the nails that deck his fingers,
Or takes his knife in hand—as now and then
He had been bent on mending some old pen.
At length the judge exclaims in accents deep,
“Mister Attorney !”—he has gone to sleep.
And to the greeting of the bench replies,
#. up and rubbing both his eyes.
“Mister Attorney !” cries the judge once more,
Vexed that the counsel did not wake before,
“The case”—a thousand ears are opened wide,
To know which way the judges will decide.
“Mr. Attorney, In the case,” he stumbled,
And something very indistinctly mumbled,
Then added, “I am sorry to affirm
We can't give judgment in the present term.”
How little follows from the greatest fuss,
“Montes parturiunt,” etcetera, “mus.”
Important Announcement.
The Globe says that—“During the residence of HER Majesty in the
Isle of Wight, Sir Robert Peel, will occupy the residence of Hughes
Hughes, Esq., at Ryie.” What an additional pleasure for our beloved
monarch 1
ALARMING DISCLOSURES.
(From a Report by the Punch Commission on the Causes of National
Distress.)
The Commissioners, by Punch appointed for the Investigation of
National Distress, have just completed their task. They have found that
the said distress has been very properly called national, inasmuch as it
pervades all ranks; the circles termed exclusive not being excluded.
Here follows an extract from the Report; what light it throws upon the
subject, let the public judge.
“LoRD Wiscount MARTINGALE examined :-Is a married nobleman,
with a lady and large family. Has estates in the North of England.
They are extensive ; but extensively mortgaged also. Clear rental about
5000l. a year; but finds it very difficult to live on that sum. Can hardly
make both ends meet. At times has not a guinea in his pocket. Has a
seat in the House of Lords, also a box at the Opera. The latter is 200l.
a year. Has had transactions with gentlemen of the Hebrew persuasion.
Has paid 50 or 60 per cent. for ready money. Is connected with the
Turf ; lost 1000l. last year on the Derby. Is a member of Crockford's ;
often loses 200l. a night there. Thinks that a trifle. Is also a member
of the Carlton Club, has spent 8000l. or 10,000l. in his time on elec-
tioneering. Has a mansion in Belgrave Square, and a seat in Yorkshire.
Keeps a large stud of horses and twenty or thirty servants. Gives fre-
º dinners, soirées, and déjeuners à la fourchette. Has a yacht.
Ady M. lives in the first style of fashion; has two carriages of her own.
How much he owes his wine-merchant, tailor, upholsterer, and other
tradesmen, Heaven only knows | Has, himself, no idea ; but it is a great
deal. Considers himself to be in great distress. In fact, how he con-
trives to manage at all is really unable to say. Perhaps his steward and
solicitor might. Is much fatigued with his present examination. Votes
business a horrid bore. His Brougham is waiting ; begs to wish the
Committee a good morning. -
MR. John Jackson examined :-Is a hosier and linendraper at the West
End. Pays 300l. a year for his place of business. Has a
suburban villa at Clapham ; gives 1601 per annum for that.
It is called Belle-vue House. Has a wife and five grown-up
daughters, the latter have been brought up at a first-rate
seminary. They play, sing, and speak French and Italian ;
but cannot bake or brew. Parties who could command
£1000 a year would find them eligible partners. That
would be the lowest figure. His domestic establishment
consists of three maid servants, a man, and a knife-boy.
Mr. J. calls the latter a page. Keeps a horse and gig.
House elegantly furnished. Tables, best mahogany. Chairs,
ditto rosewood. Carpets, Brussels. Piano, Broadwood.
Mode of living, plain and respectable : dinner, three courses
and dessert. Takes his bottle or so a-day—wine, superior.
Cannot think how it is, but his expenditure greatly exceeds
his income. Embarked lately in an extensive speculation
in woollens, which has failed. Is on the eve of bankruptcy.
May be able to pay le. in the pound, but is not certain.
Believes himself always to have practised the strictest
economy.
Wii li AM Wilkins examined:—Is a mechanic. Has a wife
and four small children, all in great want. Wife pawned
her last blanket this morning to buy bread. Children in
rags ; two pair of shoes and a half, out at heel, between
the four. Is turned of 30. Earns from 20s. to 30s. a week,
according to work done. Belongs to a club which meets
twice a week at the White Horse. They meet to smoke a
pipe and be sociable, talk about politics and other matters,
and sing songs. Own allowance, on an average, two pots a night ; may
sometimes go as far as a gallon. The White Horse has a skittle-ground
—is in the habit of playing there. On such occasions drinks, more or
less, as the case may be. Takes his “drop” on most days, besides beer.
Comes home at night sometimes, a little the worse for liquor. Is generally
unfit for work the next day. Knows that some workmen with wives and
families get only 9s. or 10s. a-week. Can't tell how they live upon it ;
nobody could be worse off than himself. Doesn't see, at all, how his
distress is to be accounted for.”
The Punch Commissioners have examined, besides the above, great
numbers of the nobility, gentry, clergy, members of Parliament and of
the learned Professions, besides multitudes of the working classes, whose
incomes, though for their respective stations apparently considerable, are
far exceeded by their expenditure. The consequent distress is enormous.
This, however, it is universally agreed by the examined, has no sort of
connection with their habits; and is by no means to be ascribed to their
own fault, but to the badness of the times. Many operatives, agricultural
labourers, and needle-women, who are starving on a few shillings a-week,
have also been interrogated. They impute their destitution to the avarice
and selfishness of their employers; but, of course, this opinion is untenable.
Coxundrum.—Why are learned ladies, generally, so remarkably plain
—Because they are extra-ordinary.

BEAU BRUMMELL’S STATUE, TRAFALGAR SQUARE.
PUNCH has received exclusive intelligence of a subscription which is now quietly growing at White's,
at Brookes's, at the CARLton, and other Clubs, for the purpose of erecting a statue to the memory of
George BRYAN BRUMMELL, the man who invented starched neckcloths, and gave its newest gloss
to blacking. The sculptor, whose name we are not at present permitted to reveal, has sent in a drawing
of the contemplated statue, which, carved in wood, we here present to the world at large. Brummell's

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

EXHIBITION OF THE
M. FRISBY, our friend and correspondent, late Anglo-Chinese pundit
of Canton, has favoured us with a most particular and lucid account
of an exhibition now opened at Pekin; a show which has attracted all
the mandarins and gentry, their wives and families, of the “flowery king-
dom.” Little think the sagacious English public who visit Mr. DuNN's
Exhibition, Hyde Park Corner, to marvel at the pigtails and little feet
of the Chinese, that a DuNN from Pekin—Li Li by name—has sojourned
many years in England, for the express purpose of showing to his country-
men the faces and fashions of the barbarian English. But so it is. At this
moment there is open in Flying Dragon Street, Pekin, an exhibition,
called “THE BARBARIAN ENGlish in ChiNA.” There we all are, from
high to low; numbered in cases as at Hyde Park-Corner, and a catalogue
of our good and bad qualities illuminates the darkened mind of the
curious.
Our dear friend the aforesaid pundit has translated this catalogue for
Punch; and has, moreover, regardless of expense on our part, caused
drawings to be made of our countrymen as they are presented by Li Li
to the dwellers of the Celestial Kingdom. The prominent parts of this
catalogue we lay before the reader; they will be found to beautifully har-
monise with the skill which has displayed us in cases; wherein, sooth to
say, we do appear with a certain Chinese air, which proves the national
prejudices of the artist. Whether he has improved our looks or other-
wise for the Chinese public, we leave to the opinion of the judicious and
reflecting beholder. Our simple duty is now to lay before the reader the
Chinese catalogue, translated and enriched with notes, by our indefatigable
and profound correspondent. The Exhibition is dedicated to the “Son
CASE I.—AN ENGLISH PEER.
He wears a garter about his leg: an honourable mark of petticoat
government bestowed by the barbarian Queen. The Garter is some-
times given for various reasons, and sometimes for none at all. It answers
to the peacock's feather in the “flowery kingdom,” and endows with
wisdom and benevolence the fortunate possessor. The Peer is repre-
sented at a most interesting moment. He has won half-a-million of money
upon a horse, the British nobility being much addicted to what is called
the turf, which in England often exhibits a singular greenness. The
nobleman, however, displays a confidence always characteristic of the
highly born. By winning so much money, he has broken the laws of the
country, by which more than his winnings may be taken from him ; but
it will be seen that he has pens, ink, and paper before him, and is at the
moment he is taken, making a new law for himself, by which he may,
without any penalty whatever, protect his cash. It is the privilege of the
nobility to have their laws, like their coats, made expressly to their own

of Heaven,” very vulgarly known as the Emperor. The dedication, how-
ever, we omit; as it tells us no more than that Li Li is, in his own opl-
nion, a reptile, a dog, a wretch, a nincompoop, a jackass, when addressing
the said “Son of Heaven;” that his “bowels turn to water” with dread,
and his pigtail grows erect with amazement. It will be conceded that,
allowing a little for oriental painting, the dedication in no way differs from
many other such commodities of home manufacture. Leaving the pre-
face, we begin with the
Introduction.
When your slave remembers that through the creamy compassion of
the Son of Heaven, the Father of the Universe, and the Dragon of the
World, the barbarian English were not, in the late war, seized, destroyed,
and sawn asunder; that their devil-ships were spared, their guns respected,
their soldiers mercifully permitted to retain their swords, and their sailors
allowed to return to their barbarian wives and little ones, when your
slave remembers all this, his heart is turned to honey by the contem-
plation of your natural sweetness, whilst, in admiration thereof, his soul
drops upon its knees, and prostrate, worships.
And when your slave further remembers, that in some leisure hour,
you may—with a benevolence that is as broad as the earth, and as high
as heaven, vouchsafe to reign over and to comfort the aforesaid barba-
rians, your slave tremblingly takes hope that the samples of the people
he has gathered together, with the subjoined faithful account of their
manners and their doings, may find favour in the sight of Him, who
when he sneezes, arouses earthquakes; and when he winks, eclipses
the moon.
CASE II.-SHAKSPEARE.
Sº
ºs-
This is the national poet, which the barbarians would, in their dreadful
ignorance, compare to Confutzee. It is melancholy to perceive the
devotion paid by all ranks of people to this man. He was originally a
carcass butcher, and was obliged to fly from his native town because he
used to slip out at nights, kill his º deer, and then sell the
venison to the poor for mutton. (All this I have gathered from the last
two or three authentic lives lately written.) He went to London, and
made a wretched livelihood by selling beans and wisps of hay to the
horses of the gentlemen who came to the playhouses. Thinking that he
could not sink any lower, he took to writing plays, out of which—it is
awful to relate—he made a fortune. (It is, however, but justice to the
barbarians to state that they give no such wanton encouragement to play-
writers at present.) ShakespeaRe, or ShakspeeR, or Shikspur-for
there have been mortal battles waged, and much blood shed, about the
No. 150.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
proper spelling of his name—is now the idol of the nation. The house
he was born in has been bought by the Government, and is surrounded
by a silver rail. Whenever his plays are played, the Queen invariably
goes in state to the theatre, and makes it pain of death to any of the
nobility to stop away. All his relations are dead, or it is to be feared-
such is the devotion of the court to ShakspeaRe-that they would be
turned into lords, and have fortunes settled upon them, like retired
Ministers and Chancellors. A man named Chak Les KNite, for only pub-
lishing his works, received from the Queen her portrait set in precious
diamonds, and was made Baron of Stratford-on-Avon. In a word, from
the Queen to the peasant, all the people worship ShakspeaRE. The first
thing seen on approaching Dover is a statue of the poet, forty feet high,
perched upon the Cliff. It is lamentable to record, these things; but to
fully show the moral darkness of the barbarians, it is necessary.
CASE III.-AN ACTOR.
In England, play-actors are very different to the players of the
“flowery country.” They all of them keep their carriages. When they
do not, they, like Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst, job a Brougham. An
actor sometimes spends twelve thousand a year; or if he doesn't exactly
spend it, he takes credit for the same. Actresses, too, like watches, to act
well, must act upon diamonds : these are sometimes borrowed at the rate
of a hundred and fifty pounds per annum. The present specimen of the
Actor is also a sample of the first fashions. He is allowed great privileges
beyond those of any vulgar tradesman. When he can't pay his debts he
is allowed to make a joke, which is taken by the judge (commissioner he
is called) as a very handsome dividend to be shared among the creditors.
Three jokes and a fair intention at a fourth are generally received from
the Actor as satisfaction in full to any amount of thousands.
CASE IV.-A SEMPSTRESS.
The women who live by needle and thread amount to many thousands;
and are easily known by the freshness of their complexions and the cheer.
fulness of their manners. Indeed, nothing shows the humanity of the
barbarians in a more favourable light than the great attention which is
paid by the rich and high to the comforts of their milliners, dress-makers,
and sempstresses. Women of noblest title constantly refuse an invitation
to parties rather than press too hardly upon the time of those who have
to make their dresses. Indeed, there is what is called a visiting Com-
mittee of Ladies, who take upon themselves the duty of calling, not only
on the employers of the needle-women to inquire into the comforts of the
workers, but of visiting the humble homes of the women themselves, to
see that they want nothing that may administer to their health and
reasonable recreation. Hence there is a saying in England, that “the
life of a sempstress is as the life of a bee; she does nothing but sing and
make honey.”
CASE W.--THE LITERARY LORD.
Perhaps, nothing shows a greater laxity of the English police than the
fact that a Literary Lord is seldom taken up for robbery. The specimen
here given is from the life. The fact is the English love the name of
a Lord, and so the booksellers pay handsomely for a title wherewith to gull
the poor barbarians. The novel of a Literary Lord is generally made after
the following fashion : He obtains the works of half-a-dozen of the lower
and labouring classes, and, like a Hottentot, dresses himself in their
entrails. He has been known to rob a Lion, gut a Tylney Hall, and
knock down an old unoffending Antiquary, and only that he might enrich
a miserable Tuft-Hunter. He is here depicted with a portrait of the
original scissars with which he stops books upon the highway, and makes
them deliver.
CASE WI.-A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
This is a beautiful specimen of a Member of Parliament for a place called
Lin Con. He calls himself a true son of Bull, and when his voice is heard,
there is no doubting the relationship. He is at home, surrounded by
#. of the painted Britons, and is drawing out a bill by which
nglishmen may be carried back to their pictorial condition. A cup of
tea is beside him, which he drinks cold ; his wholesome aversion to steam
not permitting a kettle to boil under his roof. Members of Parliament
—especially the Members for Lin Con—are always chosen for the clear-
ness of their heads. If a rushlight, held close to one side of the skull,
will, in a dark room, enable the electors to read the written professions of
the candidate, held close to the other side, he is immediately elected. In
the present specimen, there was nothing to intercept the rays of light which
shone through the head like the flame of a taper through a water-bottle.

CASE VII.-LITERARY GENTLEMAN IN SUMMER COSTUME.
The literary men receive the highest honours. From their body are
chosen Ambassadors to foreign states, Plenipotentiaries Extraordinary,
Governors of Islands, and other officers of great authority. All the bar-
barians, from high to low, pay them the greatest homage. The Queen
herself is so fond of the literary character, that she never sits down to
dinner unless surrounded by at least a dozen of poets, novelists, dramatists,
and others. In the Palace they receive almost royal consideration. No-
body can calculate the sum of money every year expended by the Queen
in presents of jewels, books, &c., to the authors of England. And it is
the same with the painters and sculptors. It need scarcely be added that
all these people are immensely rich.
CASE WIII.-A LAW LORD.
* This nobleman was a Chancellor, which means an officer who sells
the chances of E. Qui Ty, an article of excessive luxury, very rarely
to be indulged in by the lower classes. Indeed, E Qui Ty may be likened
to our delicious swallows' nests”; it is equally dear, and to be obtained
only at the greatest peril of the adventurer. This Law Lord is called,
particularly by himself, the Mi Tee Broom, and is accounted the best
juggler in the kingdom. He can turn himself inside out like an old
glove, and is often employed by the House of Lords to tumble and throw
summersets to keep the noblemen wide awake. He can write a book with
his toes, and even after dinner can spell every speech he has made back-
wards. With all this, he is singularly independent, and “cannot fawn or
glose" upon anybody higher than a Duke and a Field Marshal. He is a
* [.1 L1 here alludes to the nests of the hirundo esculenta, which nests are made into
delicious soup º the Chinese. The nests are chiefly obtained in the caves of Java.

man of universal doings. There is, perhaps, no man in England who can
better balance a straw upon his nose, or blow a new statute out of soap
and water. When he would make a law to make a new place, he does it
as carefully as a bird builds its nest ; and for the like reason, it being for
his own especial comfort and advantage.
CASE IX. —A SHOPKEEPER.
The shopkeepers—especially those who deal in silks, hosiery, and linens—
are a race of extraordinary people. Many of them write up over their shop-
doors “FRoM FLINT's ;” but this is only a pleasant contradiction to show
the extreme softness of their hearts, and the benevolence of their natures.
They are all of them oracles of truth; and when you see it written up in
their windows that they are “selling off at a great sacrifice,” you may be
sure that the shopkeeper, touched by the misery of his fellow-creatures,
has resolved to almost give his goods away, that he may retire to “Bricks
Town” or “Eye Gate,” or some other suburb famous for hermits. Their
shops, like those of the flowery country, are written over with moral sen-
tences, such as “No abatement allowed,” “For ready money only,” and
other choice maxims dear to the barbarian philosophers. The condition
of the shopmen is also of the happiest kind ; more than sufficient time
being allowed them for the cultivation of their souls and the benefit of
their health. Most of the masters keep libraries, and even billiard tables,
for the improvement and recreation of their young men. And whereas,
in the “flowery country,” we say as “happy as a bird,” the English
exclaim, “as happy as a linendraper's shopman.”

which adorn the “flowery country.” The poor women of England are,
almost from their cradles, made the victims of a horrible custom. It
is supposed that thousands and thousands die yearly from a disease
called Tite Lace In. The female child is taken at a very early age,
and has its stomach compressed by a machine called Sta Iz, which
is ribbed with steel and whale-bone, (whence the South Sea fishery for
whales,) and is corded tightly up the back. This Sta Iz is never, up to
the time of womanhood, taken off; as is plain from the specimen here
presented. The barbarians have a laughable notion of the use of this
custom ; they think that, by making the waist no thicker than the arm,
it gives beauty to the female—a melancholy bigotry. They also believe
that it keeps the blood in the face, and thereby improves the complexion.
The women have also another strange custom. They wear what, in their
secret language, is called a Buss El. We have inquired of many of then
the meaning of the word, but have always received a pouting, resentful
evasion. We have, however, searched the dictionaries, and found a word
somewhat like it—the word bustle, which means swagger, importance,
fuss—and in one dictionary it has no other interpretation than cheat.
CASE XI.-A BISHOP AND A BEGGAR.
The English bishop—unlike the priests of the “flowery country”—is a
man chosen from the priesthood for the strength of his mind, and the ex-
celling beauty of his life. Nothing is more common than to find the humble
curate of to-day the bishop of to-morrow. Officers appointed by the govern-
ment, travel in secret through every part of the kingdom, to discover hidden
virtue in the church ; and when they find it, it is straightway exalted. To
every bishop a large salary is paid, which, it is his religion to lay out to the
last penny among the poor and suffering. Remark the extreme simplicity
of his dwelling-place. He has just returned from visiting a hospital, and
his hat, cloak, and staff, are laid only a little way from him. Wherefore ?
Alas! although it is a cold wet night, he must out again to comfort a
dying widow. He has a hundred orphans at school at his own charge, and
often bestows dowries upon poor maidens. He has, by right, a seat in
the House of Lords, where he may be seen engaged in silent prayer that
the law-makers may do the thing that is holy. When he speaks, it is to
condemn war and injustice, and to turn the hearts of his hearers to peace
and brotherly love.
words of a bishop are honey; they feed the poor.” They have this
other beautiful saying –“The bishop carries the poor man's purse ;” and
this is the only beggar that, during the long sojourn of the writer in
England, was ever seen by him. Therefore, he can give no description
of the class from a solitary individual. In fact, after a minute inquiry, it
was discovered that the above was not a beggar from necessity; but was
really a nobleman begging for a wager. Thus, in England, there are
no beggars 1
Ilord Ashley and the House of Commons.
Lord Ashley dined a few days since with the Lord MAYor, who, with
his usual facetiousness, and doubtless recollecting that his Lordship had
just been jilted by Parliament, gave as a toast “The House of Commons
and Lord Ashley.” His Lordship, remembering the falsehood of the
“eighty-eight,” doubtless felt the full force of the compliment. It was
very like drinking the health of a man's wife to a man's face, imme-
diately on her elopement with another.

On the motion of THE CHANCELLoR of the Exchequen that the

MR. EwART said he was glad the honourable Gentleman was
disposed to take coffee at this early hour of the evening, for it was
desirable that a sober view should be taken. (Hear.) He, MR. EwART
would ask the House to look at America.

MR. ALDERMAN Hu MPHREY, on the clause about plums preserved
in sugar, expressed his intention to meet it with a direct negative.

was the very worst way of preserving it; for it was sure to be carried
away by one of the children. (Great laughter.) Perhaps plums might
be said to be preserved when they were in puddings, but let any one
| look at a plum-pudding after a few days— (the rest of the honourable
member's speech was drowned in shouts of merriment).

R. PEEL) that some of the late Government were cut to the core on
their being turned out. (Cheers.)
SIR. E. KNATch BULL begged pardon of the House, but apples had
really made him very uneasy. He was pledged to the fruit-growers
of Kent, a deputation of whom had waited on him some time ago
about their apples, and “go it my pippin” were the words they had
addressed to him.
After a few words, all at once, from DR. Bow RING, MR. Hume, MR.

LONG DRESSES.
It is a fact that ladies at present wear very long dresses. Every fact
in female fashions is meant expressly to attract notice ; accordingly, we
feel called upon to notice this.
Evil has ever its counterpoise of good. It is sad to behold the train
bedraggled with mud, but consoling to reflect that it sweeps the crossing.
The dust that saturates the flowing robe, might else have bedimmed the
boot of Wellington.
The drapery which shrouds the exquisite instep, conceals, also, the dis-
coloured stocking. What matters the bunion, unespied Elegance may
be veiled by superfluity of vesture; but it is in the power of her pro-

THE CASE OF MARY FURLEY.
SIR JAMEs GRAHAM has earned an undying reputation by his conduct
in the case of this broken-hearted woman. In the first place, although
she was sentenced to death by the honey-tongued MAULE, SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM knew nothing whatever of the matter. No ; when ques-
tioned in the House upon the atrocity of the sentence, aggravated as
it was by the funereal eloquence of the judge, who doubtless, to teach
a great moral lesson, tortured the woman with Tyburn tropes, even
the Home Secretary knew nothing of the circumstances which had
sent a shuddering horror through the heart of the kingdom. He
would, however, inquire about MARY FURLEY.
A week or so passes, and the country is astounded, horrified at the
further barbarity exercised upon the sufferer, who is frenzied, ago-
nized by the official visit of the Sheriff, come with the death-
warrant from the Home Office. There is no hope for her She
has, it is true, been driven to madness by accumulated miseries which
beggar fiction : she has been tortured into an act of insanity by the
cruelty of fortune; it is no matter, says the philosopher at the
Home Office—she must die. The woman must be hanged .
GOOSEBERRY SOCIETIES.
E consider it our duty to
call the attention of the
Government to the alarm-
ing spread of Gooseberry
Societies, one of which
has been established for
the last four years at
Whitby. If Art-Unions
are illegal, and are to be
stopped, why are Goose-
berry Societies to con-
tinue current :
We have received a
printed copy of the rules
of the Whitby Gooseberry Society, which, under the pretext of encouraging
overgrown gooseberries, has, we suspect, a political purpose at the bottom
of it. We shall be having these things play old gooseberry with the
Government.
The second rule provides mysteriously for the colour of the berry, which
it is declared may be either red, yellow, green, or white. There is more
in this than meets the eye |
Who ever heard of any other colours than
For some four-and-twenty hours the doomed creature suffers agony those mentioned Then why set them out at length with this mysterious
unutterable Sin JAMEs GRAHAM, doubtless, sleeps sweetly in his
bed—yes, enjoys that sweet, deep slumber, rewardful of solemn
duties solemnly fulfilled. Then, rising, he bethinks himself of the
poor wretch in Newgate; the fact is, he is made to think of her by
the earnest faces and loud remonstrances of a few Samaritans who
beset the Home Office. He is entreated to reconsider the sentence,
and the result is—a reprieve for MARY FUR LEY. No extenuating
circumstance has been discovered; none whatever. The case remains
as it was when Judge MAULE—whose eloquence might fire even the
Temple—denounced the forlorn offender from the judgment-seat;
just as it was, when SiR JAMEs GRAHAM sent down the death-
warrant; but the public heart has revolted at the contemplated
atrocity—the official murder threatened by the Home Office,—and
the Minister relents; yes, the woman shall be reprieved 1 She has
been upon the rack for four-and-twenty hours; but what is such
amount of torment, more or less, to one who has already suffered so
much What, another stab of the heart, to a heart so sorely maimed
and bleeding
Then appear in the newspapers comforting paragraphs, indicative
of the new tenderness of SIR JAMEs GRAHAM. Yes, think we, SIR
JAMEs has now fully considered MARY FuRLEY’s condition. Poor,
blighted creature . He has followed her through her miserable
history—has sympathised with her wretchedness in the Union, when
her sick child was cut and maimed by the Union's drunken servant—
has glowed with admiration of her, when, with her heroic woman's
heart, she again faced the misery of an unpitying world—has sorrowed
with her at the failing of her last hope, the few shillings, stolen or
lost, that were to have given her and her babe the means of life—has
felt, to painful intensity, a grief and sympathy, when—with a brain
fired with despair, the frantic mother sought a grave for herself and
child. Yes—thought we—the good soft-hearted SIR JAMEs has pon-
dered on the history, so complete in all its terrors, of MARY FuRLEY,
and he will recommend the woman to the royal mercy. A few days,
a week or two perhaps, may be the term of her imprisonment in the
Penitentiary; and then she will return to the world, to enjoy the active
sympathies even of the highest-born of her own sex, who will gather
about her, and with Samaritan goodness strive to heal the wounds
inflicted by undeserved wretchedness upon her. She will be pitied,
minuteness? But we forget. In addition to the red berry, the yellow
berry, the green berry, and the white berry, is there not—and may not
this be at the bottom of it all – the black-berry :
Again we call on the Government to put it down. If Orange Associa-
tions have been declared illegal, why are Gooseberry Societies to be per-
|mitted
It is true that some art has been manifested in drawing up the
rules, in order to give a fruity character to the proceeding ; but Punch
can perceive political thorns in every branch of this gooseberry forest.
The following rules would almost blind one into the belief that the thing
is a bonā fide scheme ; but how frequently do traitors beat about the
bush, and why may they not be beating about the gooseberry bush in the
present instance Here are some of the regulations:—
“W. That any Member producing a Berry or Berries for competition,
not being of his own growth, shall forfeit his subscription and be expelled.
“V1. That no damaged Berry shall be allowed to take a prize.”
Who will, for one moment, have the credulity to believe, that the mere
act of producing a berry not of his own growth, would be visited with the
extreme penalty of expulsion Who would imagine that the sixth rule is
intended to be interpreted literally—for what individual in his right
senses would think of offering a damaged berry—a crushed goosegog—
made prematurely into a jam—for a prize No, no, no. Mille fois §. !
There is something buried under this allegory of the berry, and the Home
Secretary ought to lose no time in looking into it.
GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS.
OUR own peculiar sources have enabled us to lay before our readers
some very interesting official rumours which may—or may not—be relied
upon.
In consequence of the difficulty experienced by the Government in
satisfying the demands of their friends, it is in contemplation to create a
few Governor-generalships on the same plan as that of India, but without
the heavy salary connected with the honourable post alluded to. In con-
formity with this arrangement, the Eel Pie Islands will probably be placed
under the Governor-generalship of Colonel Sibthorp, and a power of
recall will be vested for the time being in the Directors of the Richmond
Steam Boat Company. The Governor-general will have the nominal
power of declaring war against Isleworth, or any of the adjacent parts,
and will have a household consisting of a grand steward, a gentleman's
|
gentleman of the bedchamber, and a gold (headed) stick in waiting.

THE STARVED OUT SHERIFF'S OFFICERS.
IN consequence of the utter annihilation of the occupation of this
unhappy class of men, several parties of them have been perambu-
lating the public thoroughfares, making the most piteous appeals to
popular sympathy. The following is the phraseology which these
wretched beings adopt in describing the miserable condition they are
now reduced to. One of the party, with a more respectable exterior
than the rest, generally comes forward from among the knot, and
holds forth in a strain very similar to the ensuing :—
“Ladies and gentlemen, I am really ashamed to make this public
appeal to your benevolence. I am a respectable sheriff's officer. I
have seen better days, and have kept a house of my own, which was
always open to the unfortunate. I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
to appear before you in this miserable plight. My unfortunate com-
panions were all in the same line as myself, and are all reduced, like
myself, to the horrid state that you now see us in. These rags that
now cover us, were given to us by a kind friend in Holywell Street.
Oh! my good people, I hope that you will never be so unfortunate as
to be reduced to what we are, at this present moment. We have
some of us wives and families, who used to attend upon the distressed
persons that we received at our homes, but now we have no homes
to go to. Machinery, ladies and gentlemen—legal machinery—has
been the ruin of us. It has done away with the spinning of long
legal yarns, and so simplified the process, that any child may now do,
what it formerly took one of us, assisted by two or three men, to
accomplish. We are in the very last stage of destitution, and are
obliged to have recourse to this degrading method of asking your
charitable assistance.”
These persons appear to be set down by the generality of papers
as gross impostors, and very little sympathy is excited by their
appeals to public compassion.
BEADLES OF ENGLAND.
THE BEADLE OF THE BURLINGTON ARCADE.
The Government of the Burlington Arcade is vested in a mixed
Beadlery, which is very distinct from the pure parochial Beadlery
prevailing in certain portions of the metropolis. There is what may
be termed the reigning Beadle, who wields the actual sceptre and
has first choice of the easy-chair at the end of the Arcade; the
secondary Beadle, or Beadle apparent—if we may be allowed the
term—being only permitted to take a seat when there is a vacancy.
The subject of our present sketch succeeded to the bludgeon of office
in the maturity of manhood, and brought to bear on the destinies of
the Arcade a mind stored by experience and a forehead furrowed by
imposing wrinkles. In the discharge of his very important duties, he
always tries to preserve a just medium, by strutting along the very
middle of the Arcade, and he shows an anxiety to maintain an
equitable balance, for he often poises the bludgeon over his shoulder
with remarkable nicety. It is a curious fact that, even in the midst
of the most trying junctures—such as a lady refusing to take off her
pattens on entering the Arcade,-the Beadle has never been known
to forget the dignity of his station. The manner in which he repels
any attempt to desecrate the Arcade by the smuggling of bundles on
the part of those who are improperly attempting to make the passage
of the frontier, is truly admirable. He never descends from his high
position to parley with a delinquent, but he goes through a piece of
impressive pantomime that is sufficient to turn back the sturdiest of
bundle-bearers. In such cases as these, the Beadle first moves
majestically towards the man or boy, as the case may be, who carries
the parcel. The second motion is a tap on the shoulder. The third
consists of pointing significantly to the bundle. The fourth com-
prises an almost imperceptible brandishing of the bludgeon; while
the fifth and last is a series of flashing glances from the offender to
the gate, and from the gate back again to the offender, until the de-
linquent and his bundle are fairly ejected by ocular force from the
sacred locality.
It has been finely said by somebody, in some passage of some book,
that was, some time ago, printed somewhere, that “Beadles are but
men ;” and even the Beadle of the Burlington Arcade has some of the
weaknesses of that clay which is the “raw material” of all humanity.
Shakespean E was not wrong in observing that “A little flattery
sometimes does well”; and we have seen even the Burlington
Beadle occasionally “come over,” by an indirect feeding of his vanity.
For instance, we have seen a boy with a bundle permitted to pass
through, if the words
“please, siR, May 1 go through the 'cape f"
constituted the form of the petition. We think that it behoves the
Beadle to be just before he is generous ; but, on the whole, we think
he executes the duties of a very invidious office with considerable
temper and discretion.
A VOICE FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM.
WELL I remember, dear Maria, well,
As I my suit so earnestly was pressing,
How we were tittered at by beau and belle
Truly your situation was distressing !—
Just finished Miss Belinda's fleeting song,
Just hushed the melody of the guitar;
Oh how you blushed to see the list'ning throng
Smile as they caught—“Dear William, ask mama.”
The Jºast Hoax from America.
The New York American states, that “the Pennsylvania Legislation
has passed a law, imposing a tax expressly to pay the interest upon its
debt.” This is the best Jonathanism we have heard for a long time.
The “Albert cap."
This royal invention has positively been inflicted on the 24th regiment
of infantry, now stationed in Ireland. We are, however, happy to state,
that when our last express left, no mutiny had then broken out. It was,
however, thought necessary, before the caps were distributed, to have all
the guns shotted.

3}untb's Brophttp for the Derbp.
OUR present number will not be in the hands of the nation until after
the Derby has been run, but our Prophecy is made long before, on account
of the necessity for going to press in the beginning of the week, though we
only publish at the end of it.
Our Prophecy last year was decidedly wrong, but as it did not appear
till after the races it did not signify. The same apology will apply to any
error that may be made in our present prediction.
In order to be able to prophecy in first-rate style we consulted a pack
of cards, a telescope, and—on account of the equestrian nature of the
business—a stick of horseradish. Having dealt out the cards we com-
pared them with the stars, then visible through the telescope, and pointed
•blindfold with the stick of horseradish to the betting-list, which comprised
the names of the favourites. Having repeated this ceremony eleven times,
we tossed up a halfpenny, and cried “heads” for the Ugly Buck, but it
came down tails for “Ratan,” which left us still in a state of uncertainty.
We next dealt the cards into thirteen bundles, till we came to the four
knaves, which we put upon the four first horses, and then shuffled them up
altogether till there was a knave at each end, a knave at the top, and a
knave at the bottom of it.
* We have described the process thus minutely that the public may see
the method by which we have arrived at the prediction we are now about
to make, and in which we simply ask our readers to place confidence. We
have preferred the old imposing form of the ancient soothsayers:-

PUNCH'S COMPLETE ORATOR.
The subject of oratory has been very ably handled by Mr. M. T. Cicero:
but the course of nineteen centuries has thrown some fresh light upon it;
and Punch wishes to supply a few deficiencies which occur in the treatise
of that gentleman.
Action.
It is desirable that the head should be held up ; and it should be ob-
served, that the pockets are not the place for the hands. The latter may

specimen ORATIONS.
SPEECH on A. W. EDDING-DAY.
(Supposed to be delivered by a poetical young gentleman.)
“Ladies and Gentlemen,_In rising, on this auspicious occasion, to
propose a toast, I feel deeply penetrated with the force of that line of
Byron—
y “‘Who hath not felt how feebly words essay?"
(Quotations are always cheered.)
“My thoughts are too deep for utterance. This morning we have
assisted at a joyful ceremony, a ceremony which—which—which—like
the sun arising in glory on the ocean—diffuses a halo of joy over the
bosom, like brightness over the billows of the dark-blue sea. May the
morning which has dawned on requited Affection be succeeded by the
noon of Domestic Bliss' Yes, gentlemen and ladies, the cold ones may
sneer; but ah! the heart that responds to the echo of sympathy will
exclaim, oh 1 burningly, gushingly, overpouringly exclaim, that
“‘Love is Heaven, and Heaven is Love,’
and that the nuptial knot, consecrated by the torch of the hymeneal
altar, is—what shall I say?—is the beacon,<-
“‘Which makes a Paradise on Earth,
When hearts and hands combine.”
“Let us hope that such will be the case in this instance. Let us hope
that Miss Wilkins—I beg her pardon, she is now MRs. Dove—will roam
throughout her sublunary span, heart linked to heart and hand to hand
with the man of her choice, down the long vista of many happy years.
Oh! far in the windings of Life's flowery vale, in their sequestered cottage
near an embowering wood, may the happy couple who have just quitted
this scene of festivity, harmoniously, like two nightingales in their tranquil
nest, live and love together through many changing years—sharing each
other's pleasures and wiping each other's tears. Gentlemen, I give you
the health of MR. and MRs. Dove.”
SPEECH BY A METAPHYSICAL YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
“The relation of Time to vital existence, gentlemen, is such, that I feel
it would be inconsistent with ethical fitness, were I to trespass long upon
your attention. I have a subject in view, and also an object; and
although the object and subject are apparently connected, they are meta-
physically, as you all know, distinct; nevertheless there is a relation
between them which I should wish to see established. Gentlemen, con-
ventionally speaking (for in a philosophical sense I doubt with Socrates
whether you can be properly said to know anything), you know our friend
MR. SIMPson. Considering that gentleman as a moral and intellectual
entity, I am sure you must regard him, with me, as a perfect whole.
MR. SIMPson, gentlemen, is my subject, and his health my object, that is
to say, the object of my wishes, though in another sense it is my subject,
the subject of my toast. May subject and object, object and subject,
coexist correlatively in absolute integrity for an indefinite succession of
annual periods.”
[If you cannot recollect the foregoing, take any given number of ab-
stract expressions and hard words; string them together at random, and
spout, rounding your periods. In this manner, especially after dinner,
you will cause the most thorough balderdash to pass for profundity.]
THE CLOCKS AGAIN.
[We are authorised to publish the following Ertract of a Letter from a Young
Gentleman who lives in the New Road, opposite Marylebone Church.]
16th May, 1844.
GREAT HEAvens ! how long is the clock influenza to continue ! Invited
to dine yesterday with LADY MARY Scramjaw, at half-past seven, in
H-rl-y Street, I entered that street, viá New Road, precisely as the Clock
of M-ryl-b-ne Church indicated the hour to be twenty-five minutes to
eight. Two minutes afterwards I knocked at LADY MARY's door—’t was
opened, not by the page, that youth attired in green all over yellow
buttons like the cowslip meadows in May—not by her footman, a large
man with scarlet whiskers and powder—not by her butler, a person whom
I have frequently known to be mistaken for a dean ;-but by a maid-
servant—a person in curl-papers and red elbows, who stared at me from
either side of her smutty nose as she bade me ascend to the salon.
I did so, unannounced ; and what was my astonishment on entering the
drawing-room, to find a female in a camisole with no front of hair,
standing on the centre table and picking out the bits of wax-candle from
the chandelier that hangs in the middle of the room
Heavens ! how she screamed as she saw me.
Scramjaw herself! !
+ + xºr - * - º -
When her fainting form was carried out of the room by the footman
(who had his hair in papers) and the butler (without his coat), I found,
on glancing at the ormolu clock on the mantel-piece, that it was only
Six o'Clock. I had come too early. I had been misled by the Mary-
lebone impostor. Is this not too bad—too gross : What are we to trust,
if even Church Clocks deceive us 1
Adieu-Your distracted, but affectionate
FREDERic de Montmorexcy.
P.S. Saturday.—I shall never be asked by LADY MARY again. The
Clock is still at 35 minutes past 7 : (hang it !)

THE WHITE SLAVE.
OH ! weary goes the scrubbing-brush upon the dingy floor,
And sorely weary are the hands that scrub for evermore ;
It's scrub, scrub, scrub, from Monday morn, right on to Friday night,
Scrub, scrub, as soon as daylight breaks—scrub, scrub, by candle-light.
I'm sick to death of cleaning with its everlasting rout—
I'm sure my life's no good to me 'cept on my Sunday out.
Ah folks may talk of factory-girls, and what they have to do,
And make a dreadful fuss about the women-miners too—
And bring in bills to Parliament, and talk a lot of stuff—
They'd better let them all alone—I'm sure they're well enough.
If they have extra work to do, don't they get extra pay
But here, my mistress thinks there is no extra to the day.
She rings me up at five o’clock, and often three or four,
And keeps me scrubbing till I drop asleep upon the floor.
The factory engines and their din can't be as bad, I’m clear,
As mistress' screaming, scolding voice for ever in my ear.
Those mines must be a Paradise down underneath the ground,
With nothing in the world but coals, or dirty stones all round !—
There's not a bit of scrubbing there, no chests nor tables bright—
For dirt can't be distinguished in the dingy candlelight,
And nobody would think of cleaning, even if it were.
Oh dear !—be what there might to do, I wish I could be there !
If gentlemen would look at home who talk of factory work,
They'd see their household servants slave worse than the heathen Turk.
They'd better mend their own concerns, and lighten servants' cares,
Than lay down laws for other men about their own affairs.
And while they talk of needlework, and mantua-makers too,
Calling the nation's eyes to look at what these women do,
Bidding young ladies calculate the cost of each new dress,
By weary heads, and worn-out eyes, and so on—I confess
I wish when such sit down at home, in nicely furbished rooms,
They'd count the cost of cleanliness in work, instead of brooms—
And recollect that where they lounge, so pleasantly at ease, [knees.
“White Slaves” have toil'd and moil d for hours, sometimes upon their
I wish I were the scrubbing-brush itself, I do declare,
For then I might scrub all my life, and never know nor care.
But now I am so weary, that I can't enjoy my bed;
1 go to sleep the very instant I lay down my head.
And as to lying there at morn—why, I'd defy the lark
To wake before my mistress rings ; I wish that bell—hush—hark —
l hear her voice upon the stairs, she's coming up this way,
My goodness! if she comes in here whatever will she say?
l’m sure I shan’t get this room clean'd before the clock strikes two,
And she expects it done by twelve—she's here !—What shall I do?
BARBARITY IN BURTON CRESCENT.
Considerable sensation has been excited amongst the casual visitors to
Burton Crescent by a piece of extraordinary ferocity on the part of the
authorities. It appears that the iron posts at the corners of the streets
in that neighbourhood have long been the victims of juvenile leap-frog,
and it was feared that the constitution of the posts would not be strong
enough to prevent them from gradually wearing away under the grievance.
So far public feeling would go with the authorities, who have a right to
protect their posts to any reasonable extent ; but, in an evil hour, the
inhabitants have planted spikes on the top of those posts—so that the
boys, who cannot be deterred from jumping over, are now in danger of
being impaled on the top of them.
We have looked closely into the Law of Leap-Frog, and searched for a
Statute on Street-Posts, but we can find nothing to justify the frightful
cruelty that has been resorted to. The old thumb-screw was the last
remnant of Saxon savageness, but the ten-penny nail has never been
recognised by any of our jurists, from Coke to the “Comic Blackstone.”
Even the holdfast, as an instrument of legal torture, is about to be
abolished, by doing away with imprisonment for debt; and we there-
fore call upon the authorities of Burton Crescent to erase the spike from
their criminal code immediately.

AniMATRD DISCUSSION OF THE PORR AND MOLASSES BILL.-GLorious
DiscomfiTURE of JER. Diddle R's PARTY.
From the Correspondence of the New York Catawampus.
Washington, May 1.
EstERDAY the friends of liberty had a great treat ;
the eyes of enfeebled old Europe must “calculate”
more away abashed from the contemplation of such
an august spectacle as that of the star-spangled
land of independence.
SolomoN CRowdy was great in his speech on the
Pork and Molasses Bill, and showed up.JER. Diddler
of Bluenose county, as a swindling dotard, and
Nick RUDGE, of Little Jericho, as a murderous
ruffian.
Nick RUDGE said Sol. CRowdy was a liar ; and
pretended to laugh to scorn the assertions of a
forger and a bankrupt.
SAM Blood said that forgery was a misfortune,
and bankruptcy no disgrace. He had been bank-
rupt twenty-three times himself. He gloried in it.
(Cheers.) He would not see his friend the honour-
able Sol. CRowdy attacked with starving calumny
for such a trifle.
JER. Diddler accused Sol. CRowdy of letting off
a man who had helped a nigger to escape.
At this shameful, charge, Sol. took out a knife and cut at JER.
Diddler, who, drawing a pistol, levelled at CRowdy, but missed him;
the members on either side rushed in to the rescue; in the flurry of which
knives were used freely, and blood rose above par.
ENoch RAM, of Guinea Pig Island, was left in possession of the floor;
and, unless a surgeon has doctored him up by this, I doubt will keep the
floor a lengthyish time. He was knocked down in a mistake by the Hon.
Joel BRAwN, with a lead inkstand, which came a little too handy.
As JER. DiddleR was going home, CRowdy's son the Major sprung off
his board where he was tailoring, and fired a pistol at the Hon. JER.
DiddleR, saying, “Take that, you old rascal, for firing at my father.”
It is said the Major is going as Secretary of Legation to one of the old
courts of Europe.

BRIsrol.
The trade of Bristol is, we are happy to say, going quite away from it,
and the city is consequently becoming much more genteel than formerly;
a boon for which we are to be grateful to the authorities, who take such
heavy dues from ships, that very few of the nasty, ugly-looking things
now come to deface our harbour. Formerly it was a common thing to
have a lot of gloomy-looking merchandise lumbering up the quays, which
are now happily left free for the boys to play at marbles, presenting a
much more pleasing sight than the transfer of huge packages by brawny
men from the wharf to the warehouses.
By a return of the tonnage of goods imported into, and exported out of,
Bristol during a given period, we find the gratifying fact that a more aristo-
cratic spirit is beginning to operate in this fine city, and that the vulgar habit
of buying and selling is much less prevalent than formerly. Among the
Exports, we find Bristol board, of which there are four sheets now entered
outwards, and waiting for a passage. The Imports consist chiefly of
cauliflowers from the coast of Cornwall; and it is gratifying in the ex-
treme to reflect that the superfluous cauliflowers of the Cornish coast
will find their way to the tables of the inhabitants of Bristol.
The policy of the authorities of the port is delicately directed towards
the exclusion of those monstrous nuisances, the steam packets, with their
large smoking chimnies, one of which, the Great Western, was very
adroitly driven away from the station by the very heavy dues to
which it was subjected. An attempt was then made to establish another
of these smoke-generating nuisances, by erecting the Great Britain iron
steam ship, which, however, has happily been thwarted by the vessel
being made too large to be got out of the dock she was built in.
Among the other beauties of Bristol is a Suspension Bridge, on the plan
of that, now in the course of stagnation, at Hungerford. It has also been
discovered that there is a man with a ferry-boat near the bridge who
claims the right of rowing people across, and asks compensation from the
bridge company. He has, we understand, been offered shares in the
bridge instead of compensation; or, in other words, he is coolly requested

SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MEDICINE.
This is a small but very select society, composed of Physicians,
Surgeons, and General Practitioners. Its object is the mutual comparison,
so to speak it, of notes, for general edification. It meets once a week, at
the house of each member in rotation. At the last meeting—
The chair was taken by DR. Hookie, at the head of his own tea-table.
The worthy Chairman, with a cup of Hyson in his hand, begged to propose
as a toast, “Success to Practice.” Drunk unanimously.
The Secretary (MR. Jones) then stated that MR. Baggs had a communi-
cation to make to the Society.
MR. BAGGs would, with permission of the Society, relate an interesting
case. The patient was an elderly lady, aetatis 65; her complaint was a
sinking at the stomach, accompanied by a singing in the ears; together
with a nervous affection, described by herself as “alloverishness.” He
MR. BAGGs) had called the disorder Debilitas, and Tinnitus Aurium.
rdered—Pil: Micae Panis, box one,—three pills to be taken every night:
and a sixteen-ounce mixture, composed of Tinct : Cardamom : Comp :
draehms ten; Syrup : Simp : ounces two ; and the rest, Aqua:—three
table spoonfuls three times a day. The patient had been two months
under treatment—expresses herself to have been done a world of good—
but should like to go on with the medicine. He (MR. Baggs) considered
that he had been very lucky in his patient, and only hoped he might have
many such.
A member here suggested the propriety of drinking her health. (No,
no ; and laughter.)
Another member thought that MR. BAggs had made a good thing of it
MR. BAGGs rather flattered himself that he had. He had charged
“Iter,” each visit, 5s., besides medicine, and he had seen the case daily.
The same member wished, if it was a fair question, to know what might
have been the prime cost of the drugs
MR. BAGGs said that the tincture in each bottle, he should think, was
about threepence-halfpenny, and the syrup, perhaps three farthings.
The Aqua was an insignificant fraction of the rate on that fluid ; as was
the Pamis of the baker's bill.
One Member considered that a few powders, now and then, might have
been sent in.
Another would have applied an Emplastrum Picis to the Epigastrium.
It would have been 3s. º
MR. Baggs thought that a little moderation was sometimes as well.
The Society, generally, agreed with him.
DR. DUNHAM, BRown then recounted an instructive case of Gout, occur-
ing in an Alderman. He had been in attendance on him for a twelve-
month, and had taken, on an average, three fees a week.
The Chairman next read a valuable paper “On Professional Appear-
ance,” in which he strongly recommended black gaiters.
A discussion ensued respecting the advantages of spectacles in procur-
ing the confidence of patients. At its conclusion—
#. Chairman inquired who was for a game at whist? Several
members answering for themselves in the affirmative, cards were intro-
duced. The Society separated at a respeetable hour.
A CAW FROM THE ROOKERY.
A GENTLEMAN now (if a gentleman ever does such a thing) may dare
to walk from Oxford Street to Holborn. Between the Scylla of High
Street and the Charybdis of St. Giles's, he will no longer be forced to
choose. The demolition of the Rookery will be a great boon to boots;
a blessing to sensibilities, olfactory and sympathetic ; and a heavy blow
and a great discouragement to typhus into the bargain. “Down goes the
Rookery 1 Hurrah 1:" is the general cry. Blending, however, with the
acclamation, Punch cannot help hearing the outcry of the unlucky rooks.
In sooth, it is a dismal caw ; and seems to say, as plain as caw can,
“Where shall we go? Where shall we go?” And a mournful, a very
mournful echo, albeit an Irish one, answers, “Heaven only knows ' "

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.
To the Editor of Punch.
May 6th, 1844.
Under any other circumstance than the one I am about to allude to,
I would not for a moment condescend to address you ; but my connexion
with a young lady (in fact, the object of my affections), renders it impera-
tive that I should take notice of a piece of rudeness which certain persons
was guilty of on Monday the 6th inst. On the day mentioned, business, or
rather—(for why should I mince matters)—pleasure called me to Arrow-
on-the-Ill. In the company of her to whom I have already given my eart,
and ope to give my and, I dined at the King's Ead, intending after
dinner to enjoy, with my cigar and my brandy and water, that delightful
conversation which can only grow out of the union of 2 soles, I mean, of
course, love. Mary Ann and me retired from the dinner-table to the
beautiful gardens adjacent to the house, and seated on a rustic bench,
enjoying the beauties of nature, we were almost as appy as two engaged
ones could be, when we was—were, I mean—disturbed by shouts of laughter
coming from a certain party. I was induced to think (and Mary Ann
thought so too), that we were the subjects of their idle merriment. We
were confirmed in our opinion when we saw a individual take out a sketch-
book and commence (as I suppose) taking off our heads. Now, sir, what
there could be so amusing in us we cannot see; but perhaps what the poet
BYRoN observes,
“He jests at scars, who never felt
The pangs that wait, that wait on love,”
will explain it. In conclusion let me inform you, sir, that in my opinion
fun is one thing, and that jesting with the finest feelings of our nature is
another, and am, sir, &c.,

forwarded to us anonymously —Ed. of Punch.]
ESTATES FOR PATRIOTS.
OUR friend Tom Duncombe is, it seems, to have an estate bought for
him by the working classes as “an imperishable testimonial of their
thanks and gratitude.” . It has hitherto been usual to reward those only
who have done mischief, and there is, therefore, some freshness in the
notion of bestowing something on an individual who has at all events
generally tried to do good. Punch would be amongst the first to
congratulate the PET of Finsbury on his being regularly installed in a
snug freehold given him by “the People,” but we fear the prospect is
rather vague at present. The central committee sit in Southwark, and
request all communications to be forwarded to some place in the neigh-
bourhood of Bedlam. The Advertisement also talks of completing certain
machinery, after which the committees are to meet for the purpose of
consulting how the thing is to be done. Estates vary so much in size and
price, that it is difficult to say whether “The Duncombe Testimonial"
is to be a mansion in a park, or a suburban villa “standing on its own
grounds,” that is to say, a back-yard and a fore-court.

“SCENE.”
Galenius, having fastened up his shop for the night, goes down stairs into the
laboratory to turn the gas off. Dissatisfied with his condition he seateth himself, list-
lessly, upon the stone, and beholding the large brass mortar and pestle, he gives
utterance to the following Soliloquy :-
“My Mortar and my Pestle 1–it is midnight
And ye are slumbering on your ponderous stand,
All silently; would ye might sleep for ever !
“Yet, oh my Mortar ! I will not despise thee;
Thou art a little microcosm ; in thee,
All elements of good—all germs of evil—
Bland Syrup. Simp. and Caustic Alkali,
At times are mingled, pleasant and perilicious ;
Bitter, and sweet, and sour; cold, hot, dry, moist,
Poison and antidote ;-bliss, bane; life, death ;
All that can please the senses or disgust,
From Otto down to Assafoetida,
Within thy little hollow find a place.
“Seas inundate thee (soap and water ones),
And shapeless masses in thy crater grow
To usefulness and uniformity.
Thou holdest that within thee which doth mirror
The characters of men; deceptive Opium,
That lures the victim with a rapturous dream,
And wakes him to distractedness. Magnesia,
Fair, faultless and insipid, like a woman
With a clear skin, but an ungarnished mind.
Aloes, a bitter, yet benignant drug,
The type of a sincere, unflattering friend.
And Sublimate, whose whiteness talks of purity,
While deadly malice lurks unseen beneath.
“And thou art gentle too, my Mortar !
Thou dost return no injury, but sendest
Harmonious sounds into thy smiter's ear,
Reminding him of some old village bell,
Heard haply in his youth.”
A shrill voice from above shouteth, “GALENius !”

I want to go to bed.”
Gal. “Coming, directly.”

Worse, worse than physic. I suppose I must

That I have brought our only candle down,
And left her in the dark.”

CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.
MR. Silk BuckINGHAM was to have spoken at the late meeting held to
discountenance cruelty to animals. He, however, did not appear, having
made himself amenable to the law for the aforesaid cruelty, by appointing
Mr. Jones (the paternal uncle, as we have before observed, to the Boy
Jones) as lecturer to the forlorn of the British and Foreign Destitutes.
Mr. Jones is by the way a great American antiquarian. One of his early
lectures will be “On the toothbrushes of the Chippewaws, in connexion
with the fine arts of America.”
“THE HEAD AND FRONT OF HIS OFFENDING.”
A Bust of MR. O'Connell was refused at the Exposition at Paris. We
did not think the French were so scrupulous on the head of rebellion.

BRITISH AND FOREIGN DESTITUTE.
FIVE MINUTES WITH JONES.
We owe a very serious apology to Mr. GeoRGE Jon Es, the gentle-
man (uncle to the Boy Jon Es) who lectures at this Institution—or
rather, Destitution. We owe him, we repeat, an apology for having
mislaid his letter, which, otherwise, we should have printed ere this.
We now lay it before the reader, having—regardless of expense—
caused the engraved autograph of Jones to be subjoined to the
missive :-
British and Foreign Institute,
9th May, 1844.
If the anonymous scribbler who disgraces your paper by his
disgusting attacks upon this excellent Institution will throw off the mask,
I am ready to meet him in the arena of free discussion; but until then I
shall treat his paltry effusions with the contempt they merit. The taking
advantage of a mere similitude of names to connect me with a base-born
intruder who has caused her beloved Majesty so much alarm, is a most
ungenerous attempt to draw down public odium on one whose loyalty is
his greatest boast. I deny in the strongest manner the affinitive relation-
ship you have attempted to fasten on me ; and I trust I am too well known
to be very much injured by the calumny. The gratifying manner in
which I have been honoured by their Majesties the Kings of the French
and of Prussia, (to the latter of whom my work on Ancient America is
dedicated) and by many distinguished personages both in Great Britain
and on the Continent, is no doubt calculated to excite the envy and male-
volence of little minds; but I beg to assure you, sir, that I am armour-
proof against such missiles as you or your myrmidons can direct against,
SIR,
Your obedient,
~2.
A few words will explain to Mr. Jones, why Punch condescended
to notice him at all. Jones was put forth by Mr. Bucking HAM as
one of the orators and lecturers at the British and Foreign ; and as,
in compliance with the prayers of many members, Punch resolved
to test every commodity offered by the Resident Director to his
subscribers, the pretensions of Jones came very fairly under consi-
deration. Punch criticised Jones as he would have criticised a piece
of furniture or a piece of cookery of the Institute—a joint-stool, or a
téte de ceau au naturel.
Let us proceed to calmly consider the epistle of Jones. He first
says, he shall treat us with contempt; and then writes a long
letter to prove his resolution. This reminds us of the lady who, much
persecuted by the addresses of a foolish lover, at last married him, as
she said, to get rid of him.
Next, as to Mr. Jones’s “affinitive relationship” to the Boy Jones.
He calls that enterprising and inquiring youth “base-born,” as
though by such contempt—hardly decorous in an American—our
lecturer would throw off consanguinity. We have, however, heard
on what we thought excellent authority, that the ancestors of Mr.
Jones—very worthy, honest people—emigrated from Stoke Pogis to
America in the time of CHARLEs The Second ; and that there they
flourished, paying their way, like worthy folk : that, some five-and-
twenty years ago, a brother of Mr. George Jones, a respectable man
and very clever cobbler, came to England, where he married and settled
somewhere in Westminster. Of this marriage the Boy Jones was
the fruit, and consequently the nephew of Mr. George Jones. This
is the account that has reached us; and when we reflect on the intel-
ligence and curious spirit developed by the Boy Jon Es, to the “so
much alarm of her beloved MAJESTY,” we confess we cannot but
recognise in such powers a kindred genius to the high quality that
supported Mr. George Jones through his Ancient America. We
cannot but acknowledge a spiritual relationship between the Boy
Jones in the royal chimney, seeking information in the teeth of all
difficulties, and the historian Jon Es feeling his dim way, dark lantern
in hand, through the shadows of ancient Columbia. The similitude
must strike every one.
And now, for Mr. Jon Es's loyalty towards her beloved MAJEsty.
A—z-z-e-…’
To MR. Punch,
&c. &c. &c.
He owes the Queen no loyalty; he is an American ; and as such, to
attempt to pay more than he owes, we consider to be a very cruel
sarcasm on Pennsylvania. England has nothing to do with Mr.
Jon Es ; the lion and unicorn reject his loyalty, his “greatest boast.”
No ; he owes that treasure to his own flag. Even as an actor, he
doubtless as well deserves the “Stars” of the American banner, as
his book is worthy of the “Stripes.”
We now come to the envy that has stirred the gall of Punch—the
“envy of little minds.” Jones has been smiled upon by Louis
Phill PPE, and has dedicated his Ancient America to the King of
PRussia. However, Jon Es is “armour proof.” Achill. Es was
dipped in Styx ; Jon Es—there is evidence of the fact—was, at his
birth, soused in molten brass.
Mr. Jon Es, though an historian, has a fine eye to the vulgar profits
of life. The reader will observe how adroitly Jon Es brings in his
book of Ancient America, and thereby, we have no doubt, makes us
liable to the stamp-office for an advertisement, even though, like a
tombstone, it does but advertise the dead.
We have, for the present, done with Mr. Jon Es. We repeat, we
should not have noticed him had he not been put forward by Mr.
BuckINGHAM as one of the guides and instructors of the members
of the Institute. After perusing Mr. Jon Es’s letter to Punch, and
duly considering its elegant style and lofty spirit, our readers may
imagine the fitness of Mr. Jones to compose and deliver an “Oration
on the Life and Genius of Shakspeare”—may have some tolerable
idea of the philosophy and beauty of his Ancient America, of which
jocose work we may possibly speak further at a future season. We
may, however, ask in conclusion, how could Mr. BuckINGHAM suffer
Jones to write such a letter?
PUNCH'S NEW ROYAL MARRIAGE ACT.
As the Times very properly observed in its leader of the 25th ult,
“it is really tempting Punch to keep on the statute-book such a law as
that which has resulted in the exposure of such a variety of royal
and noble nonsense as has been lately obtruded on the world by the
publication of the late Duke of Sussex's love-letters.” The arith-
metical question naturally occurs to us, if the Duke of Sussex was,
as all admitted him to be, the most enlightened of the sons of GeoRGE
The THIRD, how much enlightenment remained for the rest of the
family
To prevent similar rubbish being shot—through the medium of the
Privy Council—into the public eye, we have drawn up the following
£2th) 330pal ſtarriage àtt.
& ºthereas, by an Act of Folly passed in the reign of GEorg E III.,
and not to be surpassed in the reign of anybody, it was enacted, that
certain royal personages could not marry without the consent of the
Sovereign :

law he did wrong, he also did write sundry letters; to wit, certain
rubbish and rigmarole, trash and twaddle, gammon and spinach,
dated the of , in the year :

year, write other rubbish besides the said rubbish, and certain other
rigmarole besides the said rigmarole, and divers other bits of trash
and twaddle besides the said trash and twaddle, as well as certain
other divers and numerous bits of gammon as well as spinach, in
addition to the other gammon and spinach hereinbefore recited as
aforesaid :
ann &Qāſertas it is expedient to prevent a recurrence of such an
exposure as the said exposure hereinbefore alluded to, and which is
part and parcel of a case reported in all the papers of the day—to

and at stated periods, in the cities of London and Westminster, or
in the precincts of the Savoy :

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
congratulates PRINCE ALBERT, who, provided he is a prudent young man,
A PLUM-ROYAL;
OR, THE SOWEREIGN AND SAVINGS BANK.
It is rumoured that the income of His Royal Highness PRINCE ALBERT
has been increased by about 10,000l. a-year, from divers places and ap-
pointments conferred upon him by the Queen. If this be true, Punch
and minds what he is about, will soon become a greater capitalist than
any other Prince has been since CROEsus.
ł. is likewise rumoured that 375,000l. per annum from the revenue of
the Duchy of Cornwall, have been granted by Parliament for the mainte-
nance of the splendour of the Court. If this, too, be true, Punch con-
#. the Court and the Parliament; the latter on its loyalty, the
ormer on its luck. He knew, indeed, that Cornwall was rife in tin, but
had no idea that there was so much to be got from it.
Furthermore, it is rumoured, that out of this last-mentioned sum, a
saving has been effected by the said Court, to the tune and amount of
25,000l. Perhaps this is a joke, in which case, Punch will be excused
for printing it ; but if it be, likewise, a fact, he congratulates the Court
again. The saving is said to have been accomplished by sending a
host of equerries, waiting-ladies, chamber-pages, and other locusts in
livery, to the right about. Now the renunciation of twenty-five thousand
pounds’ worth of pomp and vanity at once, by a Court, is exceedingly
creditable. It is setting a good example to foreign Courts, and suggestive,
to our indigent nobility, of a remedy for the Income-Tax. The nation
owes the Court a debt truly national, which nevertheless, it must be con-
fessed, it has done a good deal towards paying—in cash.
It is whispered, however, besides, that the sack, to speak vernacularly,
which has thus been so extensively distributed, has not been altogether
an empty one. Its recipients, we are told, have had their respective
sacks enriched by a compensating pension. If so, Punch congratulates |
those ladies and gentlemen, and respectfully submits to them that they
may think themselves very well off. He is sorry, though, to say, that he
cannot congratulate the Public, nor himself as a member of it, on the
additional luggage which has thus been placed on its back. That region
is sadly galled already. But he has a salve for it—the flattering unction
of Hope, which he has laid already to his particular hump.
Westminster has a Savings Bank. There will be deposited the fruit
of Royal frugality, to accumulate till it shall have grown into a princely
plum. When fully ripe, it will be placed at the nation's disposal, in aid
of a fund for the maintenance of the deserving poor. Truly, it will be a
Magnum Bonum
TO FAMILIES FURNISHING.
MR. Silk Buckingnam, of the British and Foreign Institute, begs leave
to call the attention of the public to his plan for furnishing a house, which
he flatters himself is lower than anything ever yet attempted.
His system also combines the double advantage of getting the house as
well as the furniture, and the following exemplification of his method will
at once show its value. Suppose you require four rooms for your own
use, take a house containing six, and then let people have the use of the
two you don't require, on condition of their paying the rent of the whole
building. It you want six rooms for yourself, the house must contain
nine, and so on in proportion, always, of course, allowing about one room
in three to the rent-payers. The same principle may be applied with
equal success to furniture. Thus, if you want furniture for four rooms,
your subscribers must furnish six, two of which they will have the right,
under certain restrictions, to occupy.
It will be necessary to give to the building in some degree the character
of a club, which is easily effected by supplying eatables at prices that will
enable you to furnish your own table, at a cost that is merely nominal.
For further particulars inquire of MR. Silk Buckingham, privately, at
his private apartments, basement, first, second, and third floor, of the
British and Foreign Institute.

NOTICES OF MOTION.
CoLonel. Sibthorpe, to move that an inquiry should be made whether
the MR. Gunn, who married the Duke of Sussex to LADY Augusta
MuRRAY, did not, as a clerical Gun(n), place himself in direct opposition
to the cannons of the Church.
MR. W. Williams, to move for a copy of the p e in which the
Duke of Sussex declares GUNN to be the parent of all his (the Duke's)
happiness; and whether the phrase, “Son of a Gun,” may trace its origin
to this circumstance.
MR. BROTHERTon, to move that an inquiry should be instituted as to
| the secret entrusted to GUNN, and whether an explosion would have been
the consequence of GUNN's having let out the important matter with
k——
which he was loaded.
ARCADIAN TRAFFIC.
BURLINGTON AND Lowther.—Last week there passed through Bur-
lington Arcade 580 gentlemen, 432 ladies, and 92 children; whilst 360
gentlemen,880 ladies, and 1184 children passed through Lowther Arcade:
thus giving the latter, notwithstanding a slight falling off in gentlemen, a
clear majority of 448 ladies and 1092 children. This return satisfactorily
settles the long-pending disputes of the rival Arcades of i. and
Lowther. The toy commerce of the latter has, since the Whitsun holidays,
wonderfully increased.
ITALIAN OPERA House ARcaps.-This Arcade is suffering sadly from
the want of rain. The traffic, in consequence, has been limited, for the
last three months, to the daily visits of the lamplighter. It is proposed,
however, in order to facilitate the navigation of this dangerous passage,
to have beacon-lights burning all tme day, and to lay on a Policeman, ly
way of a Preventive Service.
This is expected to double at least the
present traffic.
A POET'S LAMENT.
AlAs the days of Poetry are flying;
They blow up mountains, and they cut down trees;
Through groves of lamp-posts now the zephyr's sighing,
And steam and ashes choke the once cool breeze.
The engine's whistle scares the lark and throstle ;
The ‘rural force’ puts down the blackbird's song,
And stokers now Stoke-Pogis poets jostle,
As sad they wend their weary way along.
Velocipedal Fancy goes by vapour;
Imagination soars in a balloon–
Ah me ! I fear the only use for paper
Will be for bills, bank-notes, and cheque-books soon.
Snowdon, alas! my own beloved mountain,
They'll level thee : thy copper into tin
They'll change, and Lake Llanberis' ev'ry fountain
Will be cut off, and rubbish carted in.
Sleep, sleep, ye Dryads! cut for railroad “sleepers,'
The lofty monarchs of your woods lie low ;
Drown, drown yourselves, ye Naiads' plunge as deep as
Oblivion lies;–no more your cool waves flow
To the sweet murmuring of sedgy music :—
The gas-works and the vitriol-works have cooked it,
Killed all your fringing flowers; and, getting too sick,
Turned upside down, the finny fry have hooked it.
Cease, Nature, cease to toil thy warm spring-showers
No more are wanted—water-carts abound.
Our fair ones smile 'neath artificial flowers,
Why does the useless lily deck the ground 1
Soon, when the starving poet cannot use it,
The Thames will be one mighty flow of ink;
But should some future crack-brain try to muse it,
A city pump's the Hippocrene he'll drink.
Moral Retribution at last.
M. GALIGNANI, the publisher at Paris, who, by a twenty years' piracy
of English Literature, has realised a large fortune, has just been decorated
with the Legion of Honour. We really do not know which is worse--
the punishment or the offence.

DER FREIzchüTz AT THE HAYMARKET:
(a syncretical essay.)
THERR inheres in some Existences, whether actual
or real—for Existences may be actual without being
real, and vice nersá–a Spirit of Renascence, an Ele-
ment of Regeneration, a Recreative Power, of which
that truthful idealism, the Phoenix, may be regarded
as the type.
This Truth (which is also a Fact) has been recently
exemplified by the Drama; which, engulfed in the
vortex formed in the intensity of their absorptive
power by the theosophic and scientific energies of
Society, had so well nigh perished that it was neces-
sary to close Covent Garden. But here a new AEon
descended on Mr. Webster; and he accordingly pro-
posed to step in, and carrying out the great purpose
of which the Humane Society is aesthetical, to resusci-
tate the lifeless patient.
The Stage, under its Shaksperian meridian, boasted
no other scenery than mere placards. The decline of
the Drama has been contemporaneous and co-exten-
sive with the augmentation of its scenic appliances.
And no wonder. The Imaginative Element in the
Audience no longer being called upon, the British
Public became a Being of mere sense: whereas the
mental Incorporation of the Unfelt and Unseen is es-
sential to the appreciation of all Poetry; of which the
Drama is a form.

Imagination is a Power whose Aspirations tend ever
to the Illimitable and the Infinite. The Sphere of the
Executive is the Definite and the Restricted. Hence
it is clear why Mind-painted scenery must transcend
that done in distemper.
We hail the dramatic revolution which has so
happily been commenced by Mr. WEEstER. We
hope, too, that he will proceed, and apply the Principle
which he has thus, as it were, disinterred, yet more
extensively. Why should not the Incantation Scene
in Der Freizchütz be got up after the manner which
he has adopted in the Taming of a Shrew 2 Let its
horrors, instead of being a display of sham skeletons,
make.believe demons and fireworks, be idealised; and
then we shall have scenery correspondent to the music.
Weber, if there is any gratitude in ghosts, will rise
from his grave expressly to return thanks to the
manager; and the saving, per night, on the perform-
ance, will be immense. Those who have never before
reflected on this subject, probably have no conception
of the effect which, by the means proposed, might be
given to that terrific tableau, the casting of the seventh
bullet. Most of our readers have seen what we allude
to at Drury Lane; let them remember that picture
first and then look on this:–

THE LITERARY WORLD.
Dublin.
MR. Huffy, of Spanglesea Street,
has an imposing list of New Works
announced for publication. “Ireland
and the Irish,” however, takes the lead
in the Catalogue offered for public con-
sideration. The “Man of the People,”
of course, leads the column, and opens
the ball with “Some Observations on
the Comparative Decline of Gullibility
amongst the Irish during the Summer
Months, as exemplified in the rapid
Decline of the Repeal Funds.” By
the same Author, “The Irish Swallow;

tion on those which frequent the
Conciliation Hall.”
“On the Beauty and Utility of
Brevity in Public Speaking.” By
John Augustus O'Neil, Esq. (a lineal
descendant of “Con of the Battles,”
—and he looks it !), formerly of Bun-
nowen Castle and the Conservative
party, and latterly of Burgh Quay
and the parts adjacent. “This,”
says a Radical ". of high charac-
ter, “is smartly thrown off, and the
production of one who feels the ne-
cessity that exists for the general
adoption of the principle he advocates.
Mr. O'Neil himself, we are bound in
candour to admit, was, at the com-
mencement of his present political
career, a little too much inclined to
trespass on the patience of his au-
ditory.”
“On Punch, and the Solace to be
derived from a Perusal of a London
Weekly Print of that Name, and the
Discussion of an Irish Mixture bearing

evidently mixed a great deal, not so
much, perhaps, in the society of his
political papa, as out of it. Through-
out these pages there is apparent an
admirable outburst of the spirit that
should pervade such a work—hot,
strong, and stirring. It savours, in
short, strongly of “KINAHAN's Best.”

that the unwashed in his locality are
growing sulky, and as he quaintly ex-
presses it, " anxious for money or

either to denounce them as “sordid

to remove the sacred ashes from the rock where

after your conduct on that expedition.

the honours that such a brutal and uncivilised
acceded to the request you made; our men dug up the body you wanted ;
honour and yours; our officers and governors did their utmost to please and
} welcome you, and held you out, at parting, the hand of fellowship.
º flung your best cabin furniture overboard; turned your ship into a fighting
monster—all guns; and had made a solemn vow to die—to sink to a
man—'ods marlinspikes and lee-scuppers l—rather than strike to the English.
Nobody asked you to strike to them. They had just been treating you with every
imaginable kindness and courtesy; in reply to which you shook your fist in the faces
of the brutal Islanders, and swore you would never be bullied by them.
It was a genteel and grateful way of expressing your sense of a kindness—a polite
method of showing gratitude worthy of the most civilised nation in Europe. It had
not the least bluster or bad taste. It did not show that you had a propensity to
quarrel – that rancour was lurking in your heart—that your return for hospitality
was hatred and rage. Your conduct was decent and dignified, and worthy of a gallant
sailor, a gentleman, and a king's son.
The gratitude of your nation is proverbial. The fondness of the Carlists of France
for the men who sheltered them and fed them, when their countrymen would have
had their heads off, is known by all persons who read a French newspaper. You,
of the younger branch, seem also to possess the same amiable quality.
What a compliment to our country is this new pamphlet you have been publishing !
—a compliment still greater than that of proposing to fight us with the Belle Poule 1
—You were kindly received in our perfidious Island last year. You visited our
cities, towns, and country, our towns inland and seaboard. And your benevolent
patriotism instantly pointed out to you, while considering the “Etat des Forces Narades
de la France,” that it would be very easy to burn all these fair quiet towns, lying so
peaceful and confiding along the water side. They were entirely defenceless, and
their unprotected condition touched your great soul, and suggested to your Christian
spirit the easy opportunity of plunder.

any more; your chivalrous spirit suggests more
agreeable conquests. “With a steam navy,” say
you, “nothing will prevent us from inflicting upon
the enemy's coasts losses and sufferings unknown to
them hitherto” the riches accumulated upon
our coasts and in our ports, would no longer be in

doubt—a pleasing manifestation of opinion from a
person closely connected with the throne; a kind

and glories in its tippetite for murder. There is only one nation that
boasts of its perfidiousness, and walks the world in the sunshine,
proclaiming itself to be an assassin. We may be perfidious, but at
least we have the decency of hypocrisy. We may be sordid, but
at least we profess to worship Christian peace—not Murder and
Napoleon.
It is for you to do that: for you to fulfil the mission given you by
Heaven, which made you as it made an animal of prey. It is only
you who shout daily with fresh triumph your confession of faith, that
you will rob when you can ; that when at peace you are meditating
aggression; that statesmanship for you is only the organisation
of robbery; you who call rapine, progress—murder and pillage,
* the propagation of French ideas,”—and massacre, “the maintenance
of the rank of France in Europe.” Go pander to the vanities, Join-
ville, of your sage and reasonable nation foster their noble envy,
recreate their angelic propensity to work evil—inflame their Christian
appetite for war. The King's son of such a nation can surely not be
better employed than in flattering the national spirit. If he love
peace, they say he is a bad Frenchman. Commerce is brutal and
English, unworthy of the polished intelligence of the French people.
Their culte is glory. Continue, Joinville, to minister to that noble
worship; the more you insult your neighbours, the more “national”
your countrymen will think you. Don't spare your insults, then, but
suggest fresh plans of invasion with the calm assurance which renders
your nation so popular all the world over. Assert your claims in
the true, easy, quiet, unambitious, gentle, good-humoured French-
polished way, so little querulous, so calmly dignified, so honestly self-
reliant I Do this, and you can't fail to become more popular. Invent
a few more plans for abasing England, and you will take your rank
as a Statesman. Issue a few more prospectuses of murder, and
they’ll have you in the Pantheon. What a dignity to be worshipped
by those, who, if not the leaders, at any rate are the Bullies of
Europe.

MEDICINE FOR THE MILLION.
RoPERLY speaking, Medicine for the Million consists
of Universal Wegetable Pills, Pills and Ointment, and
Life Pills; all of which possess the singular property
of curing all diseases.
That they possess this property has been ascer-
tained by satisfactory experiments, made by a board
of physicians. This board is established by the
Government, which licenses the sale of the medicines,
and guarantees the assertions of their proprietors; a
thing which it never would have the profligacy to do,
if it were not certain of the truth of them.
Ordinary medicines, if they have any operation on
the human system at all, act, when taken unnecessa-
rily, as poisons. Universal Vegetable Pills, Pills and
Ointment, and Life Pills, never can be taken unneces-
sarily, even when a man has nothing the matter with
him; so that it is impossible that they should poison
anybody. On the contrary, Life Pills, being meant to prolong life, may
be taken daily in large quantities, like the staff of Life, namely, bread,
without doing the slightest harm.
If any gentleman or lady has hydrophobia, inflammation of the lungs,
cholera morbus, or any other disease ever so dangerous, he or she has
nothing to do but to take either the Vegetable Pills, or the Pills and
Ointment, or Life Pills, whichever they please, and they will certainly
be cured.
The attestations in favour of these several medicines may all be depended
on. None of them are false; and every cobbler, tinker, tailor, clod-
hopper, and mechanic who signs his name to them is perfectly qualified to
judge of diseases; so that when he says he has had this or that complaint,
and has been cured of it by the said medicines, his word may safely be
taken by the British public.
We therefore unhesitatingly recommend all persons to take Medicine
for the Million whether they are ill or not, instead of having recourse to
medical men; who, having made diseases the study of their lives, cannot
possibly be expected to know anything about them.
THE GREAT O’. IN LOVE.

It seems that O'Connell has been the victim not only of the blind
goddess, but also of the blind god ; for it is said that he has let his own
judgment go by default, by having fallen in love with a young lady ; and
that he will speedily be taken in execution in the Court of Cupid.
It appears that the Liberator was first smitten at a Repeal meeting,
where the father of his intended occupied the chair.
Some of O'Connell's political allies are under the apprehension that
his politics will change in consequence of his being bent on effecting a
union on his own account, instead of repealing one.
At a recent meeting in Dublin, the following song was very generally
hummed by a portion of the company –
Och 1 'tis love, ’tis love, ’tis love,
Which maketh DAN go round ;
And every hour, beneath its power,
He's getting faster bound.
'Tis love will make him falter,
And 'tis indeed a shame ;
But if he goes to altar,
He cannot be the same.
Och I 'tis love, ’tis love, ’tis love, &c.

A few days ago, a new steam-vessel was launched for what is ambitiously
termed the Putney trade, a branch of commerce with regard to which an
alarming extent of ignorance is painfully prevalent. We were not aware
that Putney was by any means “nutty” on its commerce, which really
cannot even compete with that of Chelsea, which has at least the indi-
genous Chelsea bun to stand upon.
The vessel lately launched is called the Sunbeam; and it may probably
be designed for the exportation of cucumbers; for if trade can be got out
of Putney, cucumbers may be certainly got out of Sunbeams. The launch
took place in the presence of “a select party;” which means, of course, a
few boys and the people personally interested in the vessel. When we hear
of a craft having been launched for the Putney trade, we naturally seek
to know why a place with such commercial pretensions is unrepresented
in Parliament. We should really like to know something more of the
place ; and we think there would not be a better subject just now for the
local historian than Putney and her people.

THE METROPOLITAN FLOWER SHOWS.
the various Squares of London there has
been considerable excitement, in conse-
quence of the extensive preparations made
conjointly by Nature and the private gar-
deners to getup Flower Shows on a scale of
unprecedented verdance. The well-known
Squares of Golden and Fitzroy have
struggled bravely for the palm ; and can-
dour compels us to say that while Golden
has come out gloriously in its Daisies,
Fitzroy has given the former a blow in its
Wall-flowers, which will not soon be for-
gotten.
It is true that Golden Square possesses some advantage in its Evergreens,
but the trustees of Fitzroy, determined not to be outdone, have given a
fresh coat of green paint to their railings, which thus throw far into the
shade the dusty privet hedge of its venerable contemporary. If Fitzroy
Square cannot sing with Polyphemus,
“Oh, ruddier than the cherry,”
the Square-keeper may certainly indulge in a parody, by exclaiming in the
ears of his western rival,
“Oh, greener than the privet.”
We understand that the extreme luxuriance of the metropolitan Flower
Shows has been occasioned chiefly by the sudden and unexpected glut of
wall-flowers, which have sprung up this year in places that have been
hitherto “wholly unaccustomed to public flowering.” The private libe-
rality of a young lady has also contributed much to the floral beauty of
Fitzroy Square, by the purchase of three reduced Virginia stocks in the
name of the Square-keeper; and the cuttings or dividends are expected
to be transferred into the Bank (in front of the railings) for the benefit
of all the inhabitants.
Good lºesolution.
We hear that so strong a sense of remorse and self-degradation has
been excited in the House of Commons by reflection on its late tergiversa-
tion on the Factory Question, that a resolution is to be moved, at its
next sitting, to the effect that it be forthwith summoned before its own
bar to answer to itself for bringing itself into contempt.

ourselves some day into one of the carriages, and trusting to chance an

railway is for the accommodation of the individuals who will go over the

OPENING OF THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE AT CLIFTON.
OUR Bristol correspondent has favoured us with the very interesting
particulars of the ºº:: the Bristol Suspension Bridge, for the con-
veyance of passengers. The bridge, it is true, consists of only two piers,
with no communication between them, the chains not having been yet
fixed, but it has nevertheless been at length arranged that the bridge
shall be thrown open to the public by means of baskets drawn along a
rope fastened to the piers already alluded to. An experimental trip was
taken by the directors and shareholders, when a procession was formed
in the following order:-
A Potato-BAskET, containING THE PRINCIPAL ENGINEER.
A Clothes-basket, with the Committee.
a HAMPER, with The standing counsel, AND ATToRNEY of The company.
A Basket Horse,
Carrying an Inspector of Police.

HAND-BOOK OF ETIQUETTE FOR MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS.
We have been favoured with a sight of the above work, which is in the
press, and will shortly be published. The subjoined, which is a specimen
page of it, will be interesting to our Transatlantic subscribers.
“When you go to Congress, provide yourself with a thick stick. Also,
take a dirk with you, which conceal under your waistcoat; and put a
brace of horse-pistols, with half-a-dozen slugs in each of them, in your
hinder pockets. For America is the land of unlimited discussion ; to
attack each other just as they please is the privilege of her unfettered
senators; and weapons may be useful to you in debate.
“Having taken your seat with your hat on, square your arms, and extend
your knees, so as to push the member on your right and left away, and
make room for yourself. The American citizen is born free, and therefore
ought always to sit easy. If there is a convenient resting-place before
you—a gentleman's shoulders, for instance—put your legs up, and set
your heels thereon. In this position, combining comfort with elegance,
sit and chew tobacco; dispose of the results of mastication, right, left,
“You may not, perhaps, wish to take a prominent part in debate. In
that case shout, yell, screech, and whistle (after the fashion of gentlemen
in another place), when any one is speaking whom you do not like. Or, if
you had rather be quiet, take out your piece of hickory, and your whittling
knife, which, as a genuine American, you will of course have about you,
and whittle. Never think of attending to what is going on, unless it suits
you. Your opinions should be like your country : let them not be
enthralled by another's. Talk, behave, and do in Congress as elsewhere,
just as you please. Restraint and obligation are the shackles of the slave.
The nigger may control his inclinations : but the will of the American
citizen should be his only law.”
This little book is quite an American Chesterfield.
pocket of every Senator in the Union.
It should be in the
straightforward, anyhow, as may best suit your convenience, which it
is your birthright to prefer to that of º; else : or smoke a quiet
cigar, if you like that better, till you become excited, and wish to speak.
Whereupon, jump up instantly, and begin. Stand on no ceremony—
interrupt any member's speech, or that of the President himself, without
scruple. The slave who cares a cent for anybody is unworthy the name of
American. Make yourself heard, if you can, by dint of clamour, and keep
obstinately on your legs till somebody pulls you down. Struggle, cuff, and
vociferate, some time after that—in fact, till you are fairly overpowered;
and be not prevailed upon to hold your tongue till the gentlemen around
you stop your mouth by force.
“Remember, in preparing yourself for a set speech, whom you are about
to address; and be ready for consequenees. Button up your coat to the
chin, or take it off, and fling it, with your neckcloth after it, into your
neighbour's lap ; then break forth into a violent strain of abuse, accom-
p. by the most frantic gesticulation, against the party opposed to you.
from this you are to modulate into a scurrilous personal invective
against some individual present, calling him all sorts of names, and
concluding by an offer to fight him. The American orator should combine
the ferocity of the wild-cat with the fire of lightning.
“It is more than probable that you will be interrupted in the course of
your harangue. The object of it will very likely make a rush at you. If
he does, do you spring forward to meet him. Collar him; wrestle with
him : that is the way to pple with a political opponent. Beat him,
bite him, scratch him, kick §. tear his clothes off his back, try and
gouge him. Never leave him till you are torn asunder. The British
bull-dog may be ugly; but the true-born American, when aroused, is con-
siderably uglier.
“Your dirk is to be employed when you are in danger of being throttled
by an adversary. Your pistols are to be used in a paroxysm of hate and
rancour, which the speech, expression, or appearance of some member
whom you detest, may suddenly excite in your bosom. Fire straight at
him; if he presents a fair mark all the better : if not, never mind. Were
you to warn those around him to clear off, you might be stopped. You

RETRENCHMENTS IN THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD.
It will be seen from the papers that what is usually called “a whole-
some spirit of economy,” is being practised in the royal household, and on
HER Nº. Birthday the usual order for eggs and currants, to make
a plum-pudding for the domestics, was countermanded by a special
messenger from Buckingham Palace. We don't know how much it cost
the special messenger to get down to Windsor to countermand these things,
but we suspect he must have swallowed up—as the phrase goes—a
tremendous lot of currants in the expense of his journey from London.
This sort of economy is, no doubt, “wholesome,” because a rich plum-
pudding is considered a very unwholesome thing, and the domestics being
deprived of their usual dinner, preserved their own health if they could
not indulge in drinking the health of HER MAJESTY.
We understand that, at the family party assembled at Claremont.
Economy was toasted after dinner, which gives to Punch a fair excuse for
roasting it.
The following were among the “sentiments” on the festive occasion :--
“The House of Brunswick, and may they never forget that a pin a day.
is a groat a year.”
“The little PRINCE of WALEs, and may he become eventually great in
obedience to the glorious Scotch maxim, ‘that mony a little makes a
mickle.’”

240 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IMPORTANT TO
SHOPKEEPERS.
Arrention, gentlemen. if you please, to Punch. He has a suggestion
to make to you ; one which concerns your pockets.
Gentlemen, you wisely erect Gothic, Elizabethan, Louis-Quatorze,
Arabesque, Grotesque, and Nondescript shop-fronts in first-rate style.
May you get credit for your outlay, equal to what Punch gives you for
your sagacity For you are very sagacious. You know that a discerning
public has decided that good wine does need a bush ; that all is gold
that glitters; and that the more you spend in show, the less you are likely
to charge for goods.
The notifications of “Awful Sacrifices" and “Tremendous Failures'’
in your said windows are very clever. Your advertising vehicles are fine
notions. The ideal dandy (not to say beau idéal) which you in particular,
tailors, station in your door-ways, is a capital invention. Your decoy-
ducks, or, if you please, yourselves, are very knowing birds: your
traps are baited admirably. Still, there is another line that you might
try.
‘what think you, gentlemen, of dressing your assistants in character 3
They are, many of them, very fine young men. You would thus combine
the attractiohs of the common shop with those of the fancy-fair. Consider,
with a Romeo, or better still, a Don Giovanni behind the counter, what a
throng of beauty there would be before it. Ponder on the advantages of
having a Macbeth to serve out the plaids. Some of you, who furnish
funerals, put, with a taste and feeling truly admirable, your house-fronts
into mourning ; why not your shopmen also Make Hamlets of them.
With their faces pale from confinement and over-work they would look
the character admirably. Or to match with those of your shops, of which,
with a more refined propriety, you render the exterior half sable, half
ROMET
SAT tº S
showy, let your shopman be attired on one side as Hamlet, on the other
as Harlequin.
You who deal in old armour and curiosities, might serve your customers,
through Templars and Crusaders. Tea-dealers and grocers, you might have
Chinamen. The "Squire to the Knight of the Thimble might be Sir
Piercie Shafton. Turks would tell immensely in the carpet-warehouse;
Hindoos in the India ditto. For a tobacconist, Sir Walter Raleigh
would be the very man ; and who would suit a bookseller like Dr. Faustus t
Ancient Greeks and Romans would do for any business, especially for an
“old-established” one. Characters, too, might be selected promiscuously
from the whole range of the Drama. Consistency, however, should not
be violated ; it would be wrong, for example, to have Shylock in a
sausage-shop.
Gentlemen, you do not work your shopmen half enough. This asser-
tion seems, on the face of it, an egregious falsehood, perhaps: no matter.
You linen-drapers, for instance, are content with turning them away unless
they sell so much ; and, for their procuring custom, you trust wholly to
their native graces. You will say that you dress them in black, with
white neckcloths. Pooh I this is the attire of waiters and Young
England: the ladies hate it. Give them military uniforms: that would
be more to the purpose.
Many of you are in the habit of calling your shopmen “Gents.”
Henceforth, let them be gentles: remembering that customers are
gudgeons. Or as all, doubtless, is fish that comes to your nets—or hooks—
let your purchasers be trout, and your shopmen artificial flies—vermilion,
green and gold. And, if your business does not experience a “rise,” never
trust— 33&I?C#.
AMUSEMENTS FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
URING the Whitsun recess, MR. PETER BoRTHwick
intends giving, in the racket court of the
old Fleet prison, an entertainment to be
called “Two Nights with the House
of CoMMONs.” It will be divided into
two parts; the first to consist of an
entire debate upon any popular question,
—the Factory one, perhaps, in which
the honourable member will give imita-
tions of the principal speakers, introducing
their favourite sentiments, particular ges.
tures, manners, and axioms. The party-
cheering will be given just the same as in
the House, and the yelling and hooting
will be executed by 658 supernumeraries
engaged expressly for the purpose. A
division will take place at the end of the debate, and a majority be declared
in favour of the bill.
The second part will commence with the second reading of the same
bill. The same speakers will speak ; but to make the entertainment as
perfect as possible, a little opposition will be got up, and an amendment
put from the other side ; whereupon every member will contradict what
he said on the former occasion, and vote on the division with the opposite
party. The majority and minority, in fact, will change places, and the
amendment be carried by exactly the same number of votes as the
original bill. The costumes of the members will be taken from the best
W. authorities. The white waistcoats have been made after
ſoung England's own private cut, and the wigs, beards, and mustachios,
have been modelled—regardless of horse-hair—from the originals them-
selves. The whole will conclude with a song, called—“ Who's afraid to
speak of eighty-eight 3" (in allusion to the majority), which will be sung
by MR. Borthwick, in the character of SiR James GRAILAM. Bouquets
have been provided for the occasion.
MR. JAMES'S NOVELS.
MR. HoRNE has insinuated in his “New SPIRIT of The Age,” that
MR. JAMEs's works were written, not by himself, but by so many secretaries
kept upon a weekly salary for that purpose. In answer to this, we have
received the following statement. It must convince every one, we think,
who has at all looked into MR. JAMEs's Novels, that the number published
by him every year is not so extraordinary as to induce the belief
they were written by more than one person—at least this was our con-
viction after reading one or two of them.
The number of Novels manufactured by G. P. R. James,
From Jan. 1838 to Jan. 1839, And from Jan. 1842 to Jan. 1843,
was 3 novels, was 7 novels,
or 9 volumes, or 21 volumes,
or 2880 pages. or 7230 pages.
CAUTION –All the genuine Novels have the name of “G. P. R. JAMEs
Esq.” printed in full on the title-page ; and librarians are desired to note
that his Novels are made up of never less than three volumes, with an
intimation in the work that he is “Historiographer to HER MAJESTY.”

YOUNG ENGLAND’S “OLD NOBILITY.”
Lond John MANNERs, the Home Secretary in posse, when Young
England shall reign in Downing Street, has published a volume of
verse, called “England's Trust, and other Poems.” In this volume there
are—let the reader prepare for a gasp—the following lines:–
“Though I could bear to view our crowded towns
Sink into hamlets, or unpeopled downs;”
he could not bear that any decay should fall upon the ancient peerage.
No, says Lord John—
“Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die,
BUT LEAve Us still our old Nobility.”
These lines were quoted by EAR L Ducie at the last Anti-Corn-law
meeting, but their authorship, and the book that enshrines them,
were not given. We supply the information for the benefit of the
curious. And now, with every wished respect for the ancient aris-
tocracy of England, we must own we were not aware of its surpassing
worth in comparison with wealth and commerce, laws and learning.
We were evidently in darkness. Yes; put all the wealth of Britain
—all the labours of its law-makers—all the inspiration, as bequeathed
in books to us, of its God-gifted men into one scale, and clap an Earl's
coronet into the other, and that little ornament shall make all things
else kick the beam; that is, when the balance shall be held by the
pure and just hands of Young England 1
But, after all, would not this said old nobility be a poor, plucked,
very shabby thing indeed, divested of all the refinements, all the
graces of life With no wealth, no commerce, no laws to restrict
its ferocity, no learning to soften it, would it be little other than a
BARoN Rawhead AND Bloody Bon Es—an EARL Gog Magog, living
on lordly pillage Let us imagine this old nobility, spared amidst
the wreck of all the commerce, all the arts of life.
Our “crowded towns” exist no longer. No : Liverpool is a mere
village; Birmingham, a hamlet ; Manchester, a place where two or
three old women ply the spinning-wheel; Sheffield, a casual home
for wandering tinker or knife-grinder; all Yarmouth shrunk into
the huts of a few fishermen who eure herrings; and where Hull, and
Paisley, and Glasgow stood, are swamps and unpeopled downs. Bit-
terns boom and hares squat, where merchants trafficked and bail-
lies judged. Thousands and thousands of men have withered from
the face of the earth—whole towns are but as empty sepulchres; but
let us clap our hands, and utter hallelujahs for the mercy; there
remains to us what is dearer than all—for very dear, indeed, it some-
times has been—“our old nobility.”
Well, in this new state of things, let us inquire what Old Nobility
would do for itself? All wealth and commerce annihilated, Old
Nobility would of course set about subjugating the rest of society
into hordes of serfs and villains. The sword of Old Nobility would
exact from Serfdom labour unrecompensed, brutal vassalage, and
those sweet privileges of the by-gone day,+the droits du seigneur. As
for laws, Old Nobility, as of yore, would make its own; a stout, sig-
nificant code of timber, easily comprehended by the meanest capacity
—namely, a gallows at every castle-gate.
And then for learning, why should Old Nobility care to spell even
the monosyllable sword, so that Old Nobility had its own sweet will to
make its mark with it?
“Oh, no 1" cries the spirit of Young England, “there is such an
instinctive refinement, such an inborn benevolence in Old Nobility,
that without any other laws or learning than those fashioned and
acquired by its own pure heart, it would work the unqualified good
of the meaner millions placed by Providence at its disposal.” Of
course, all history proves the truth of this. We have no doubt that
if all the social arts should suddenly perish, and Old Nobility, to dis-
tinguish itself from vulgar flesh and blood, should dye its body with
its armorial bearings—that in this forked and naked state its first
anxieties would be for its unpainted brotherhood. Wealth, com-
merce, and all learning having perished—save, indeed, heralds'
learning—let us imagine a MARLBorough, with his coat of arms and
legend painted in bright woad, after the manner of the Aneient Bri-
tons, on his back and breast ; let us imagine him labouring for the
comfort and welfare of the unadorned vulgar. What—what would
he do for them tº Doubtless, all laws and learning having perished,
the impulses of his own noble soul would instinctively supply him
with benevolence and wisdom all-sufficient. Without a rag upon
him, the Duke would stand up Nature's nobleman ; would show to
meaner thousands the workings of his benevolent neart, aye as plainly
º
as though he were Momus's ideal man, with a pane of glass let into
his bosom.
It would certainly be a fine thing for the real interests of the world,
if all commerce, laws, learning, and arts had perished, and all the
children (dear elder sons !) of Old Nobility had no other outward
signs of their greatness save their arms beautifully tattooed in their
anatomies. Then, indeed, would be seen the inherent value of the
griffins, and unicorns, and hydras, and pelicans of the herald. As it
is, the exquisite beauty of these glorious creatures is, in a measure,
lost by the unceremonious elbowing and jostling of wealth and com-
merce—by the bold intrusiveness of laws and learning.
It must, however, be a great consolation to the people of England
to know in what consist their happiness and refinement as a nation.
Not in their wealth; not in their laws; not in the wisdom of their
buried sages. Oh, no Let them despise their colonies—their fleets
of ships—their literature, with its wings of light for distant nations—
let them look upon all these things as cumbrous vanities, and with
thankfulness pulling at their hamstrings, reverently drop down upon
their knees before the House of Lords !
The House of Lords ! Yea, that is Nature's prime laboratory;
there, indeed, she toils and labours to “give the world assurance” of
her best article. Indeed, the eye of the philosopher—borrowing the
glass of Young England—sees painted on the outside of the House
of Lords—“Real men to be had only within. All elsewhere are spurious.
No connerion with any other House.”
Thus, all that we have to do, is to pray for the procreation of
Peers. With an Old Nobility, let “crowded towns,” with all their
wealth, sink and perish — the true national property is in the
Lords !
Thus, if Bristol should be again assailed by a devastating mob,
let them burn every stick. Why should we care, if Bristol's Earl
be safe
If all Westminster should catch fire, let it blaze away; for have
we not a nobleman of that ilk dearer than all Westminster put
together
And, lastly ; if an earthquake should swallow the entire city of
LoNDoNDERRY, ought we to mourn over the desolation,-seeing
that Providence has benignly preserved to us a wise and gentle
Marquess of that glorious name Yes!—
“Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die,
BUT LEAve Us still our old Nobility.”

THE “BOY JONES.”
s we were going to press, we received the following
letter from the “Boy Jones,” which missive we
hasten to lay before the reader.
“MR. Punch, – It is, I believe, thought in
Buckingham Palace that I’m in the middle of
Africa, or some such place. Gammon | Though
where I am I sha'nt tell anybody. However, 1
write to you about one MR. George Jones, of
the British and Foreign Destitute, who you say
is my uncle. Sir, I deny the relationship. I've
heard MR. Jones spout, and I’ve tried to read
his Ancient America, and after that, I won’t have
GeoRGE Jones at any price. You say you see a likeness between us. I
take this as an insult. If I could have done nothing better than Jones,
do you suppose I should have ever found myself under the royal sofa ; or
tasted the cold custards in the royal larder No, sir; pray do know gold
from brass; do 'scriminate between real genius and downright impudence;
and believe me (as it will ever be my glory to sign myself) no relation
to GeoRGE Jones, but nevertheless *The Boy Jones.’”
It was only fair to our correspondent to insert his letter, which, how-
ever, proves nothing. The Boy Jones may think it due to his vanity of
position in the world to deny, in the words of MR. GeoRGE Jones, his
“affinitive relationship" to that gentleman; but the world is, after all,
not so credulous a world as to believe him. No : MR. GeoRGE Jones
remains uncle to the Boy Jones.
Pedestrian Intelligence,
A GRAND running match came off the other day between the Hon.
CAPTAIN Doo and the Fetter Lane Pet, commonly known as Muster
Levy. The Captain had the lead at starting, and went away at a capital
pace, with the Pet close upon his heels, along the Strand. Levy was now
evidently gaining the advantage, when the Captain mended his pace till
he got into the Precincts of the Savoy; and the Pet, having referred to
a slip of parchment in his hand, at once abandoned the contest.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S PROPHECY FOR THE DERBY.
Aving referred to our Prophecy for the Derby
inserted in our hundred and fiftieth number,
we find that our prediction was literally
and completely verified. After this the
Monk of DEE must hide his head in his own
{
§§ capacious cowl, and FRANcis MooRE, physi-
§. cian, must allow himself to be infinitely less
than we have proved ourselves.
Our prediction, it will be remembered,
opened impressively with two characteristic
lines, the burden of which was “Swindle,
swindle,” and thus we dimly shadowed forth
the tricks of the turf, till the very felicitous
ine—
“Bubble, bubble, Ugly Buck,”
at once demolished all hopes of the first favourite being the winner. In
the line—
“Shall Orlando head the ruck?”
we asked a question. A question implies a doubt. The doubt implied
points of course to the question destined to arise as to his being the
winner. In the terse little couplet–
“Ask ye where Ratan shall be?
I will answer, “You shall see'."
* claims of the other favourite are most summarily knocked on the head,
for “You shall see,” is a quaint old term that was common with the early
soothsayers, and is equivalent to the modern expression of “Oh, yes,”
“Don’t you wish you may get it,” “Hooky Walker,” and other figures of
speech designed to indicate a failure.
In the line—
“Who is he would back Leander ?”
There is a faint foreshadowing of the fate of that unhappy horse; while
the words—
“Grumble, grumble, fumble, fumble, stumble, stumble,"
allude to his lameness (stumble, stumble); the subsequent searching for
his jaw (fumble, fumble); and the grievous complaints (grumble, grumble.)
that were made in consequence of the deception that had been practised.
The two concluding lines of the Prophecy are, however, decisive as to
the winner, or at least they would have been decisive, but for a slight error
in the printing. As the couplet stands it runs thus–
“”Tis the horse that first comes in
Shall alone the Derby win.”
Now, it is quite obvious to everybody that this is a mere error of the
press, and that the lines should have been—
“'Tis not the horse that first comes in
Shall alone the Derby win.”
Thus at once making the Prophecy perfect, by fixing upon Running Rein,
who not being mentioned, must of course be intended, for it is an invari-
able rule of grammar that a word is said to be understood when it happens
to be omitted.
In consequence of the success of this Prophecy, we shall be happy to
cast nativities, tell fortunes, and undertake soothsayer's work in general,
on very moderate terms.
Damaged prophecies that have not been realised, can be repaired ; old
nativities recast; and horoscopes kept in order by the year, month, week,
day, hour, or minute.
The Lord Mayor and the Steamers.
The Lord Mayor was in a frightful state on Whit-Monday, in conse-
quence of his inability to control the steamers above Blackfriars Bridge,
beyond which his jurisdiction does not extend; and consequently the
captains of the craft were enabled to overload their vessels, and laugh in
his Lordship's face, which they did with all the gusto of clowns at a fair
grinning through horse-collars. The Lord Mayor was almost frantic—
looking daggers at the crowded steam-boats as they passed before his
eyes, and crying out with superhuman energy for “more jurisdiction.”
e sincerely feel for a dignitary hemmed in by narrow limits, such as
those which circumscribe the civic sovereign. Paramount as he is on
the Bridge of Blackfriars, his power terminates with the coping of that
elegant structure; and, while he is omnipotent on the top of i. balus-
trades, he is utterly powerless in the mud at the foot of it.

of July. This is not the first time that Liberty has been chiselled in
France. |
ENGLAND AND HER BEADLES.
The BEADLe of the Lowther Arcade.
This Beadle—if we are justified in using so strong a term—is an
unhappy victim to the principle of economy, for while nominally in
the possession of dignity, he is deprived of those externals which
serve to make dignity respectable. There is nothing in fact about
him to distinguish him from ordinary mortals, but a simple band of
narrow gold lace on his hat, while the rest of his attire is that of a
copying clerk out of employ, or a second old man in a theatre where
the salaries are more—we ought perhaps to say less—than dubious.
We do not profess to be acquainted with the internal policy of the
Lowther Arcade, but we have no hesitation in denouncing the par-
simony which can put a Beadle into torn Berlins, ill-blacked
Bluchers, a rusty coat, and pantaloons that the veriest clowns would
feel themselves disgraced by appearing in.
Perhaps it may be urged that there is a sort of republican simpli-
city in the every-day costume of the official upon whose shoulders
the tranquillity of the Areade is supposed to rest, but we feel bound
to say that there is more real despotism under the cheap Gossame
and halfpenny switch of the Beadle of the Lowther, than under the
The
Lowther Beadle is to the boys in the Strand, what PyM was to the
royalists, or, to come nearer to our own time for an illustration, he is
a sort of Robespie RRE confined to a limited sphere of action. The
dictatorial attitude he assumes when expelling a boy with a basket
beyond the boundary, has all the savageness of the first French revo-
lution, tempered, perhaps, by a certain outward regard to the more
humanising influences of the present century.
It is generally understood that the Beadle of the Lowther Arcade,
like the President of the United States, is an elective officer, but the
former enjoys one advantage over the latter, namely, that of being
permanently in the possession of his dignity. The Lowther Arcade
is inhabited by a people of very primitive habits, who endeavour to
allure the passing stranger into a paltry kind of commerce, the prin-
cipal articles of which are trifling toys, and cheap crockery. The
Beadle seldom seems to sympathise with the natives in the hopes and
fears which their internal occupations naturally excite; but he con-
fines his attention to the guarding of the frontier from those invasions
which occasionally threaten it. While we have felt it our duty to
comment rather severely upon the Beadle in his public capacity, we
are glad to be able to add that he is—for what we know to the contrary
—a tender husband, an attached friend, an unexceptionable waiter
at evening parties, an affectionate cousin, a punctual lodger, a good
nephew, and in all his dealings with his fellow-men—a good customer.

R U L E S
To be observed by the English People on occasion of the Visit
of his Imperial Majesty, Nicholas, Emperor of all
the Russias.
As the limperial Autocrat of all the Russias will doubtless make
visits to numerous public institutions in this country, it
behoves Punch to instruct the people, as to their manner of
behaviour.
Remember, the man is a stranger—his visit is a surprise (and, per-
haps, not an agreeable one—but that, as the poet observes, is
neither here nor there), and we must meet this surprising
incident with presence of mind.
Britons ! Nicholas is here; and as he is here, it is our duty to
make the best of him.
If you love Punch, be peaceful. You have obeyed me as yet :
listen to me now. No hissing ; no rotten eggs; no cabbage-
stalks; no howling; no mobbing—no nothing.
Only SILENce 1 All the institutions of the country which he is
desirous to see, let him see—if he wishes to examine the
Punch-office, our boy has orders to show him over the premises.
If he is hungry or athirst, beer from the opposite public-house,
buns from Messrs. Partington's, the pastrycooks', will be
provided—and at our own expense. But all shall be done with
a politeness so frigid, that, by Jupite R AM Mon 1 the Auto-
crat shall consider himself in Siberia. If he leaves money,
the Order of “the Swan with two Necks,” for the united
publishers—snuff-boxes and stars for our chief contributors—
we shall know what to do with the same.
ALL ENGLAND must do as Punch does. Listen . When Nicholas
comes, receive him well. Let the manufacturers open their
doors, and show him where they lie, work, working, in their
factories—our emperors of the world. Let our railway people
set their engines to work as hard as they like, to convey his
Imperial MAJEst Y. Let our race-horse keepers show him
their studs—even the teeth of their horses—if he have a wish
|- to look that way. Let Colon El Bulld ER be civil to him at
Woolwich : let the Port-Admiral be polite to him at Ports-
mouth : let the keeper of Golden Square show him over the
green labyrinths and perfumed glades of that delightful resort
of enchantment. If he have a mind to eat white-bait at
Greenwich, let not LovEgnov.E balk him.
But mark I he will be dropping his money, snuff-boxes, brooches,
orders, and what not, wherever he goes. Money costs him
nothing, remember, and he can afford to lavish it. Friends,
Countrymen, swear with Punch t—Carry every shilling the
man leaves to the Polish Fund. Remember what is the hand
that offers those honours. Don't touch his money. Hand it
over to Lond Dudley STUART.
But why speak 1 I know you won’t touch his money. You are not
mercenary: you never traffic money against honour: you don’t
care for titles—no, nor your wives either: the caution is quite
needless in our country.
At Ascot, in the Park Reviews, at the Opera, wherever people
congregate, the order of behaviour to be laid down is simply
this: Any person who hisses or hoots, is to be held as a snob
—he does not understand good manners, nor the decencies of
hospitality ; but if any person hurras, or takes off his hat,
you have Punch's instant orders to lick him. “Bonnet” that
miscreant l Flatten his beaver over his miserable eyes. Tear
his coat tails up to his cowardly shoulders. Seize, brethren,
seize his trembling legs, and away with him. Ducking was
meant by Nature for that man. Pumps long for that man—
why call him a man —that thing, that kickshaw, in a word.
Friends ! you understand what I mean I
You must not be inveigled into a foolish admiration on account of
his Imperial MAJEsty's personal qualities. He is very tall,
but the Horse-Guards are as big ; very handsome, but WIDD1-
combe is as good-looking ; very athletic, but can he do as
much as MR. Risley or his little boy He can ride very well,
but we offer to back the Marquis of WATER road against
him ; very slim, but he wears stays; he is very broad-chested,
but he pads enormously. When the Guards with their silver
trumpets play the Russian National Air—beautiful as that
melody is—let no man cheer. Remember the trumpets that
played it when the Cuirassiers of PAsKEwiTch rode into
burning Warsaw.
As to the Ladies, the Ladies Patronesses of the Polish Balls, who
have determined to continue their entertainment, Punch
blesses them. Ladies, you have acted like men l Let there
be several Polish Balls this year during the EMPERon's pre-
sence. Punch will attend them all. Yes, we will dance the
Polka with JUDY there; we will shut ourselves up with BARon
NATHAN and practise for the purpose.
As for the politicians—there will be probably a dinner at the
Russian Company—and poor PEEL will be called upon to
praise his guest—poor fellow !—he can’t mean it; but
remember it’s his business—he'll blow out praises from those
active jaws of his, just as the Guards' trumpeters blow “God
save the Emperor” from their silver clarions—don’t hold
either organ responsible for the tune it’s made to play. “Poor
Peel, poor dear PEEL poor Bobby 1” let us exclaim—pity .
ing heartily the work assigned to him.
As for the Press—there is, between ourselves, our friend J–NK—Ns
—but Heaven help us! never mind what he says. We know
the poor fellow's state of brains under that powdered sconce
of his. Let JENKINs, then, have full liberty to be as compli-
mentary as he likes.
And if his Imperial Majesty does anything handsome for RIgE .
[The Printer respectfully states that Mr. Punch's MS. stops abruptly here, nor has
he been heard of at the Office since he went away, it is believed, to Greenwich, to dine
with a party of Young England, who are thinking of making him their leader.]
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE METROPOLIS.
E mentioned in our last that the railings
of Fitzroy Square had been fresh-
painted, and we have now the pleasure
of stating that the Lion at the top of
Northumberland House has just re-
ceived a new coat of a light buff colour,
which seems admirably adapted for
summer Wear.
A new watering-cart has been char-
tered for Russell Square ; and the sentry at the Duke of York’, column
is now wearing every day his regimental ducks. The flag of St. Martin's
Church has been scoured and ironed ; and the fountain in St. James's
Park, which is modelled after an inverted cup and saucer, has begun to
play for the summer season. We cannot close this list of Picturesque
improvements without specially mentioning as a climax, that the Clock of
St. Clement's has not stopped once during the last month.
strange Insult to the Eing of Saxony,
It is with much sorrow that we state the following fact, for which,
unfortunately, there cannot be the slightest doubt, as our informants are
of the very highest class. Lady Wilhelmina AMELIA Skeggs, writing to

TOASTS AND SENTIMENTS FOR THE EMPEROR OF
RUSSIA.
EAR all men l Nicholas, EMPERoR of Russia, has
come over to visit the QUEEN. Of course some of
the distinguished readers of Punch will ask him to
dine with them. On the occasion of a grand dinner,
it is usual to propose toasts and sentiments. It is
not every kind of toast and sentiment that absolute
monarchs approve of ; Punch, therefore, as a boon
to the different Noblemen and Prelates who take
him in, and who may happen to have the Emperor
for a guest, has cut and dried the following, which,
he hopes, will suit the taste of his Majesty —
“Universal Despotism.”
“Persecution, Intolerance, and Civil and Reli-
gious Bondage all over the World.”
“Brute Force, the Mainstay of Government, and
the Preservative of Order.”
“Slavish Fear, the sole Source of Obedience.”
“The Will of the Autocrat, the Fountain of legi-
timate Authority.”
“Thraldom of Speech and Opinion.”
“Servitude of the Press.”
“Slavery of Conscience.”
“Arrest of Civilisation and Retrogression of
Humanity.”
“The Perpetuity of Serfdom.”
“The King of Prussia, and all Abettors of Ty-
ranny.”
“Don Miguel, and his speedy Restoration."
“The Downfal of the Greek Constitution.”
“The Extermination of the Poles.”
“Woe to the Children of Israel.”
“Long Life and Misery to the Exiles of Siberia.”
“Severity in the Judge, and Inhumanity in the Gaoler.”
“The immortal Memory of Nero.”
“Dungeon Extension.”
“The Knour”—which last toast is to be coupled with—
“The LADIes; may those of Russia never want a Lash, nor an Execu-
tioner to wield it.”
And “May the Man who flogged the Daughters of Poland, never be
forgotten.”
THE ROYAL ARRIVALS.
the ARRIVAL OF RUSSIA.
Woolwich and BARon BRUNow were kept in a state of dreadful excite-
ment during the whole of Saturday by anticipating the arrival of the
EMPEROR of Russia, who, with much discretion, assumes the alias of
Count ORLoff ; feeling, no doubt, that though “the rose by any other
name will smell as sweet,” the EMPERoR of Russia by a different appella-
tion might be a little more welcome. BARon BRUNow knowing the
necessity of being in the way when his Autocrat master arrived, kept
rushing backwards and forwards from his hotel to the landing-place every
five minutes, straining his eyes from the end of the wooden pier, and
clutching telescopes out of the hands of the bystanders with an anxiety
that attracted universal sympathy. The Baron was attended by M.
BENTSHAUSEN, with whom he conversed frequently in Russian ; and, as
we could only collect occasionally the words “Koff,” “Woptoff,”
“Craeken,” and other equally incoherent exclamations, evidently indica-
tive of fear, we are unable to give the entire purport of their conversation.
At length, at about 10 o'clock, three steamers were dimly perceived
through the darkness of the evening, which the Emperor had judiciously
waited to take advantage of. BRUNow instantly jumped into a boat with
SIR FRANCIs Collier, and pulled off towards the Cyclops, which was the
vessel that brought the Autocrat, the Cyclops being selected, no doubt,
on account of its name—the forging of fetters being a pursuit with which
the Emperor could sympathise.
The Imperial Russian was dressed in a cloak and cap of pale gray, the
colour generally selected on the stage for the costume of Mephistophiles.
On meeting LoRD Bloomfield, who got out of his carriage in the middle
of the street, the Emperor gave him his hand to kiss, and, without
taking any further notice of anybody or anything, the Autoerat repaired
to London by a conveyance that had been already prepared for him.
The Emperor's steamer was attended by the Cerberus, which was
selected as a guard of honour, in consequence of the peculiar fitness of
the Cerberus to guard the person and temporary abode of Nicholas. The
Emperor arrived at Ashburnham House at about 20 minutes past eleven,
and they got him to bed before midnight.
In the morning, at half-past nine, PRINCE ALBERT arrived to see the
Russian Lion, or rather the Russian BEAR ; who, on meeting the PRINCE
CossoRT on the staircase, threw his arms round his neck, and hugged him
most affectionately. The PRINCE seemed hardly prepared for this mode
of salute, but returned it, as the Times alleges," with great apparent
feeling.” The EMPEROR then led the PRINCE to the drawing-room, and
they had a long conversation, the subject of which was an invitation from
HER MAJESTY to the Palace. Russia said, it would be inconvenient ; the
PRINCE, on the contrary, insisted it would not, and with much good-
humour talked about the number of spare beds they had at Buckingham
Palace, with linen always aired, and every convenience. At ten, the PRINCE
departed, and Russia went to church, where he heard a sermon by
DR. Popoff—another name that it was thought would sound sweetly in the
ears of the Autocrat.
On his return from church he was called for by PRINCE ALBERT, who
took him to see the QUEEN, at Buckingham Palace, where a déjeaner was
prepared for him. . He also patronised Saxony, by going to see him in
his apartments, looking on to the Mews, somewhere at the back of the
Palace. . The EMPERoR was pleased to say that Saxony seemed a very
respectable sort of person for a third-rate sovereign; and slipped a hand.
some present, at leaving, into the hands of MINKowitz, the Saxon prime
minister.
The EMPEROR then went with PRINCE ALBERT to pay a round of visits
to the Royal Family. In *...* through the Park, Saxony and MINKo-
witz were met in a gig by the Russian cortège, and the EMPERoR gave a
familiar nod, which was returned by Saxony touching his hat respectfully.
The EMPEROR then proceeded to Apsley House, to see the Duke or
WELLINGTON, to whom the Autocrat offered his hand, as he had done to
LoRD Bloomfield.; but the hero of Waterloo, instead of kissing it, shook
it with much cordiality. The EMPERoR looked a little astonished; but
PRINCE ALBERT explaining in Russian that it was “only the Duke's odd
way,” the Autocrat condescended to talk to his Grace on the subject of
his elegant mansion and splendid furniture. The EMPERoR greatly
admired the cornices in the drawing-room, from which the curtains were
suspended : upon which the Duke observed in bad French—“ Votre
Majesté préfère les Cornices aur Poles. Les Poles sont hors de la
mode à présent; grâce à votre Majesté.” (Your Majesty prefers cor-
nices to Poles. Poles are out of fashion at present, thanks to your
Majesty.) After this very dreary specimen of Iron Ducal wit, the
Emperor went home to his apartments, and, as the Times informs us, “fell
into a sound sleep, from which he did not wake until nearly 6 o'clock.”
While Russia was asleep, Saxony and Minkowitz called to pay their
respects, but went away, afraid to wake him. The Duke of CAMERIDGE
also called during the imperial siesta, and also went away. Though he
began to talk so loud in the passage that His Royal Highness may be said
to have been rather pulled away by KNESEBech, who attended him.
CAPTAIN RAY, the Police Commissioner, and a body of the A division, with
a Superintendent and two or three Inspectors, have been appointed to
attend the EMPERoR during his stay in London. Why is this?
A COMPLIMENT TO RUSSIA.
y the Constantinople correspondent of the Morning
Chronicle we are favoured, among other news,
with the following:—
“We learn by a letter from Trebizond, that Abdullah
PA chA, the governor of that province, put three men to
the torture, who had been accused of the robbery and
murder of a Russian merchant. The cruelty of this pro-
ceeding is almost unexampled. Red-hot copper caps were
put upon their heads, which, on being removed, carried off
the scalp; red-hot balls were applied to the temples till
the eyes started from their sockets; their feet were held
before the fire till the flesh was burnt off, and other cruel-
ties were practised upon them, too shocking to be related.
We understand that the Pacha thus refined upon his usual
cruelties, from a desire to please the government of which
the murdered merchant was a subject.”
The Governor of Trebizond has, evidently, a fine knowledge of the
various pleasures of various governments. England, France, and others
might have been satisfied with the mere death of the murderers of any
one of their merchants: but not so Russia. Oh, no l To “please” the
social appetite of Nicholas, it is necessary to cocker it with the scalps of
murderers, taken from their living heads by red-hot, copper caps. Even
at the banquet of the Great Fiend, Nicholas might—after this—show
himself an epicure, hinting at tit-bits of human agony, unthought of,
aye, by Moloch himself.

of the cheeseinonger who supplies Mr. Buckingham's family.

Constitution, that all are equal in the eye of the Law—except when
the Law voluntarily shuts its eye, and can't, therefore, be expected
to see—the Holborn Montem passed off very successfully.
In accordance with the example set by the future statesmen, &c.,
who are being educated at Eton, the young gentlemen of St. Giles's
sat down to an excellent breakfast, before sallying out to collect, by
playful robbery, the means to pay for it. Many of the old St. Giles's
boys were present, among whom were some of the most distinguished
cadgers of the present day, who regretted that they could not partake
in the fun that was in store for their youthful successors.
The hill or mound called Holborn Hill, is well known to all who
have been there, and this spot was the grand centre of attraction.
At the appointed hour, the procession moved from St. Giles's towards
the Hill,—the whole of the boys being divided into classes or Dials,
each of them belonging to one of the Seven Dials of that peculiar
school in which they are being educated.
On reaching the place, the young gentlemen commenced their
demand for salt on the numerous omnibuses and vehicles that
descended Holborn Hill, and gave to each person who contributed
a sort of receipt, with the words “Pro More” engraved on a kind of
cab-plate; but on these being shown, a fresh demand was humor-
ously made, the gallant young Diallers declaring Pro more to mean
that more must be given. It was really delightful to see the rising

nable seizing the purses, pocket-handkerchiefs, pins, seals, and
watches of the passengers, who were, of course, highly delighted at
the robbery being practised upon them. Master Spriggins, of the
Seventh Dial, was remarkable not less for the elegance of his fancy
costume than the boldness of his demands for “salt;” and being
armed with real weapons, after the example set by Eton, the reality
of the scene was much enhanced, and the resemblance to highway
robbery was more perfect and satisfactory.
The police authorities had, in the handsomest manner, lent a
strong body of men to facilitate the arrangements made by the young
gentlemen for securing their plunder. The costumes were many of
them exceedingly elegant. Among the most remarkable was that
of Master Shontshanks, of the fourth Dial, who was dressed after
the celebrated statue—of a boy—over the school-house at Kensing-
ton. The dress consisted of a coatee, of the cut of the ancient order
of jockies; a pair of leather breeches, of the time of George the
Third ; a waistcoat of the middle ages—or, rather, a middle-aged
waistcoat, with shoe-buckles of the time of PyM and the Puritans.
Master Popgen wore a shirt, with hanging sleeves—that is to say,
the sleeves of his shirt were hanging in ribands about his arms, in
accordance with the style of Henri Quatre. He also had a coatee
slightly slashed, with puffings of white calico lining protruding from
the aperture.
It will hardly be believed that some attempt was made in the
course of the Holborn Montem, to stigmatise the whole affair as a
gross mixture of highway-robbery and mendicancy; but its close
resemblance to the affair at Eton, of course led to its being viewed,
as it deserved to be, in the light of a youthful frolic. The plunder
at Eton was, as we are told, invested in the name of the Captain, to
finish his education ; the result of the Holborn collection will, it is
understood, be devoted to the defraying the costs incurred by any of
the Seven Dial boys going through the usual degrees, till they attain
to a fellowship in the Thieves' Fraternity.

ONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCII, OR THE L
TO DANIEL O'CONNELL, ESQ.
CIRCULAR ROAD, DUBLIN.
DEAR Silvy O'PEllico,
One of my young chaps had got ready a caricature of you, with
about three hundred-weight of chains on your old legs and shoulders,
and you in a prison-dress.
But when he heard that you were really locked up, he said he would
not for the money's sake (though I pay him well for it), publish his
paltry picture, or do anything just now that would give you pain.
Neither shall I crow over you because it has come to this, and because
having played at bowls, you have at last got the rubbers. If you did
not organise a conspiracy, and meditate a separation of this fair
empire—if you did not create rage and hatred in the bosoms of your
countrymen against us English—if you did not do, in a word, all that
the Jury found you guilty of doing—I am a Dutchman
But if ever a man had an excuse for saying hard things, you had
it : if ever a people had a cause to be angry, it is yours : if ever
the winning party could afford to be generous, I think we might
now : for we have won the rubber, and of what consequence is the
stake to us ;
Though we may lock you up ; yet it goes against our feelings some-
how to think that The GREATEST MAN IN THE EMPIRE, (for, after
all, have you not done more for your nation than any man since
WAshingtoN ever did ) should be put in a Penitentiary ever so
comfortable, in a road ever so circular.
Though we may lock you up ; yet for the life of me I don't see
what good we can get out of you. As I said to Mrs. Punch yester-
day, “If any friend from Ceylon were to make me a present of an
elephant—what should I do with it? If a fine Bengal tiger were locked
up in my back-parlour—what would be my wish : Out of sheer
benevolence I should desire to see the royal animal in the Strand.”
Though we may lock you up, let us remember that there are seven
out of our five-and-twenty millions of fellow-citizens to whom your
punishment is a shame and a bitter degradation ; and it is ill to set
so many hearts rankling against us.
Are they not bitter enough already—the fourth part of the men of
our empire—and have they not cause ! Does the world show a
country so wretched as yours ? If you were to send over the Lion
of Judah to Lambeth, and the Dove of Galway to London House,
wouldn't we turn their Lordships out ; and shall we be too hard upon
you for trying to do likewise, and failing
No. And though your sentence is a just one in spite of all they
may say, yet, please GoD, let it be inflicted with a gentle heart. I
like the judge who burst into tears when he passed it.
Vulgar triumph over such a man as you—chuckling over such a
great discomfiture as that—is the work of low-minded, sordid knaves.
If ever I laugh, it shan’t be because a great man falls. I wish you
would come out of prison, for how can I poke fun at you through
the bars 1
Why did you invent stories of murder and massacres which we
never committed Why did you brag and swagger so much Why
did you tell so many untruths regarding us Saxons ! The Truth was
bitter enough, and hard enough to be told. We are mighty angry
with Nicholas about Poland; but, until lately, has somebody else
treated Ireland better
I tell you what is to be done. It was arranged in a Cabinet Council
last night—where the Right Honourable Mr. Punch was called in—
it was arranged that her MAJEsty should take a trip of pleasure in
the summer (after a certain interesting event), and that her steps
were to be directed to a kingdom called Ireland, which I have occa-
sionally heard described as the greenest and most beautiful spot in
the world.
She is to go suddenly, and without beat of drum. She will take
the first car at Kingstown Pier: and LoRD DE GREY will be dis-
gusted, and the people of the city surprised, to see the Royal Standard
of the Three Kingdoms floating on the tower of the seedy old Castle i
of Dublin.
After a collation, another car (or “cyar,” as you call it in Dublin— -
and a confounded vehicle it is) will be called ; and her MAJEsty,
stepping into it, will say, “Car-boy, drive to the Circular Road.”
He will know what it means. THE QUEEN HAs come To IRE LAND
to take DAN out of PR1son.
“Let bygones be bygones,” Her MAJEsty will say, (only more
elegantly expressed,) a fib or two more or less about the Saxons
won't do us any harm ; but try now, jewel, and be aisy: don't talk
too much about killing and eating us : don’t lead poor hungry fellows
on to fancy they can do it. The Irish are strong men, and won every
battle that ever was fought. That is very well. From Fontenoy
upwards, we give them all to you. I have no objection to think that
CAEsAR’s Tenth Legion came out of Tipperary; and that it was three
hundred of the O'GRADys who kept the pass of Thermopylae.
Nevertheless, have no more of that talk about bullying John Bull.
Keep the boys quiet, and tell them they can't do it. It's no use
trying: we won't be beaten by the likes of you.
But we have done you wrong, and we want to see you righted;
and as sure as Justice lives, righted you shall be.
Such are the words that I wish to whisper to you in your captivity,
—words of reproof, and yet of consolation ; of hope, and wisdom, and
truth ! $3&AP (TA®.
THE RECTOR OF HENDON.—A CHRISTIAN PEACEMAKER!
At the Edgware Special Sessions, the Rev. Theodore WiL-
L1AMs—a gentleman not unknown to fame—was charged with
provoking a MR. Fost ER SMITH, a neighbour, to a breach of the
peace. The Rev. THEodon E, it appeared in evidence, “shook his
fist”—his apostolic fist l—in Ma. SMITH's face; and with lips that
are, doubtless, wont to drop oil and honey, said—“You are a dirty
fellow, a shabby fellow ; you are a coward.” The Reverend peace-
| maker then added—“You dare not fight.” Truly, a severe reproach
from the Rector of Hendon – from one who hath the cure of souls.
Well, evidence being heard, the magistrates—after an hour's con-
sideration—fined the Rev. Theodon E “in the penalty of 40s with
the costs.” It is a rule—a very good one—with the Police Commis-
sioners, to expel a policeman from the force if fined or imprisoned
for any offence. Ought not this rule to apply to brawling rectors f
Will the Reverend THEoldon E WILLIAMs still take his seat, as a
magistrate, upon the bench, seeing that he has so lately flourished as
an offender at the bar ! If so, then may every brother magistrate
exclaim, with Falstaff, “If I’m not ashamed of my company, I'm a
soused gurnet.”
FROM THE STATUE OF SHAKSPEARE.
IPrury Lane Portico.
MR. Punch,-A night or two since, some goodnatured folks gave a
piece of plate to Mr. BuNN, for his “unvarying urbanity” in , the
“seasons i843-44.” Well, I don't complain of this: but I do complain of
being kept perched above the portico of a house in which I have no longer
the slightest interest. Pray put it to your writer of the Comic Blackstone,
whether I cannot be removed somewhere on a habeas & Or, if I must
remain, at least let the lovers of the drama show some sympathy with my
condition; and, whilst the admirers of opera and ballet are plating Mr.
|BUNN, let my friends—if I have any—japan me; or, at least, bestow upon
my forlorn condition a handsome suit of durable black paint.
Yours, William SHAkspeaRE.
LEARNED SOCIETIES.—THE BRITISH INSTITUTION.
Professor LEADENHEAD opened the business by reading a paper on the
probable duration of the world, in which he undertook to prove that it
could not last much longer, because the Russians were rapidly annihilating
the Poles. He endeavoured also to show that the globe, continually
revolving on its own axis, must, sooner or later, be cut completely through
|by the axes alluded to.
The Chairman then made a few observations on heat in connection with
the precious metals, and illustrated his remarks by stirring a glass of hot
grog with a silver tea-spoon. He observed that it had been erroneously
alleged that glass was a non-conductor of caloric, but he begged leave to
refute the fact by conducting a quantity of “warm with " to his lips,
through the medium of a common glass tumbler. The rest of the sitting
was devoted to a series of experiments in confirmation of this discovery,
which appeared to give general satisfaction.
Isegal Intelligence.
It is whispered in legal circles that the silk gown, rendered worse than
vacant by the elevation of MR. Roebuck, will not be filled up at present,
It is, we understand, proposed to constitute a new class of barristers below
the dignity of the coif, who are to be called Corporals, to distinguish them
from the Sergeants.
It is generally rumoured that a case was laid before Mr. Roebuck by
the traversers on the state trials, to advise whether they could move in
arrest of judgment. MR. Roebuck's opinion is said to have been that
they could not, in consequence of arrest being now abolished on mesne
(or mean) process, and the whole process of convicting the defendants
having been marked throughout with the greatest meanness.

JUDGES” SENTENCES.
It is an old prejudice, that the rate of punishment of an English
culprit depends upon the enormity of his offence. Many recent
sentences convince us to the contrary. Sure we are that it more
frequently depends upon the biliary secretions of the judge who
dooms. A sentence of seven years may be sufficient to the consti-
tution of one judge, whilst another may ask fourteen ; and a third be
by no means satisfied with less than transportation for life. A taste
for punishment varies with the Bench, even as their taste for port
wine : some think that a felon can have no chance of coming up
good, save with fourteen years' keeping. Hence, are we frequently
startled by the discrepancy of sentences ! Hence, are certain judges
known by their rigour beyond the law. How often—himself, we
grant, unconscious of the wrong—does the judge wreak his own bad
temper, his own bad health, in his sentence on the felon in the dockſ
How many a convict owes an extra seven years of slavery to the
indigestion of the learned baron who tries him . With only the
difference of a few grains of calomel, how different had been his
doom | Nevertheless, the offender is sentenced—he has no appeal
from the hard bowels of the man who judged him—and away he
goes Away goes the convict-boat (as BARRY CoRNw ALL sings)–
“Bearing its wicked burden o'er
The ocean, to a distant shore ;
Man scowls upon it; but the sea
(The same with fettered as with free)
Danceth beneath it heedlessly l’”
MR. FitzRoy KELLY has gained the grudging leave of Sin JAMEs
GRAHAM to bring in a bill to give the criminal—in certain cases—a
right of appeal to the Queen's Bench. On a trial for property, the
losing party has such right; and Mr. KELLY would make human
character and human freedom merely as valuable as chattels and
money. SIR JAMEs GRAHAM shakes his head at the measure:
he declares his belief in the surpassing purity of criminal judgments:
avows this in the teeth of truths illustrative of the contrary, delivered
by MR. KELLY, who, quoting several instances, dwells particularly
upon one case in which he saved a man’s life, by incessantly impor-
tuning the judge who doomed him to take the opinions of his brothers
of the bench ; and they reversed the sentence.
At present, the culprit harshly doomed, has this chance of justice.
He petitions the Home Secretary, who knows nothing of the case, but
who asks the opinion of the judge who presided at the trial. The judge
will scarcely stultify himself, and the petition is dismissed. Thus,
when SIR JAMEs GRAHAM was implored to consider the case of MARY
Furtley, he went to Justic E MAULE who had made the injured
woman a long, hanging speech, and she was therefore ordered for
execution She was, however, reprieved; and GRAHAM—we pre-
sume again consulting his MAULE—inflicted upon frantic wretched-
ness a captivity of seven years
MR. FitzRoy Kelly observed “there was a fearful responsibility
attached to the Home Secretary in these matters.” At this, the
House cheered, but did not cry—as it ought to have cried—
“With a scream that shoots
To the heart's red roots,”—

3Literarm Intelligence.
GREAT expectations have been raised by the rumour of a new work
from the pen of MR. Silk Buckingh AM, with the title of “How to Live
on Nothing a Year.” This gentleman's long experience in adapting the
means to the end—that is to say, other people's means to his own end,
will peculiarly fit him for the task he is said to have undertaken. The
work will be remarkable for some new theories in the science of arith-
metic, and a curious sum will be worked out, by which it will be shown,
that if there are a thousand members who pay an annual subscription,
those thousands may be made to go into one, and leave nothing over. As
a specimen of subtraction we have heard it hinted, that with the public
for the subtractee, and Silk Buckingaea for the subtractor, it will be
possible to take anything from anybody, so as to give an enormous
remainder.
REFUGE FOR THE DESTITUTE.
WE are requested to state, that the above society denies all connexion
with that of a similar name lately established in Hanover Square.
THE KENSINGTON RAILWAY.
This railway was opened on Whit Monday, according to a printed bill,
and shut up again on Tuesday, in compliance with a notice in pen and ink
pasted over the printed bill alluded to.
The opening on Monday was celebrated by a breakfast at the lodgings
of the superintendent; the superintendent himself occupying the chair,
supported by his wife and family. It had been originally intended that
the Directors should have had a déjeúner at a neighbouring hotel; but
this scheme, on examining the company’s cash-box, was abandoned. At the
hour appointed for the starting of the first train a consultation was held
as to where it should go to, when it was announced to the public—verbally
from behind the counter of the station, that the trip would comprise the
entire distance to Wormwood Scrubs—passing Shepherd's Bush, and back
again. Four boys immediately took advantage of the new railway, and
returned in about ten minutes highly gratified. A neighbouring newsman
was at the platform with the whole of the daily papers to meet the train on
its arrival. Having muttered “Times,” “Herald,” “Post,” “Chronicle,”
which would have been exactly a paper a-piece for each (boy) passenger,
he retreated from the station. The police arrangements were admirable,
there being one policeman to open the carriage door, five to keep the stairs
clear, and three to take the tickets at the gate for the egress of passengers.
The select band of juvenile vagrants were in attendance during the day,
and played off some of their most popular airs upon the railroad authorities.
The Directors have in the most spirited manner hired a guard, who wears
a belt with a box for despatches attached to it. There being no despatches,
a bye-law has, we understand, been passed, allowing the guard to fill the
box with sandwiches—either for his own use, or to sell to the passengers.
The engine has been behaving splendidly all the week, running backwards
and forwards for the amusement of the boys with the most good-humoured
condescension.
If this railroad has no other effect it will at least effect a communication
between Shepherd's Bush and Wormwood Scrubs, so that if it does
nothing else, it will cement that union between the Bush and the Scrubs
which the Scrubs no less than the Bush must be, or ought to be,
anxious for.

Grene ALOGICAL discoveries.
MR. PETER Borthwick has made the very important genealogical
discovery that the country proctors are the “Sons of ZERUIAH.” Of course,
the brothers of the proctors are the nephews of ZERUIAH, and if the
county proctors should have any grandfathers living, those venerable per-
sonages must stand to ZERUIAH in the relation of uncles. We have heard
of necessity being the mother of invention, though we have sometimes
doubted the fact, inasmuch as we do not see for instance how the inven-
tion of what are called Jemmies can be the offspring of a necessity for
housebreaking.

REPORT OF A COMMISSION
To
INQUIRE INTO THE OVERLOADING OF RIVER STEAM-BOATS.
upgrwg from the following extracts, which are taken
from the evidence laid before the Committee, the
nature and extent of the evil that is sought to be
remedied, must be frightful indeed.
Thomas TARLEss—Is captain of the Daffydown-
dilly steam-boat. Has been in the naval profession
two months, but has been many years accustomed to
§ the water, having been employed by the water com-
§ pany as a turncock. Never served any apprentice-
§ ship as a sailor, but has seen MR. T. P. CookE play
William in Black-Eyed Susan. Understands the dif-
ferent parts of a vessel. The companion is the mate,
~~~ the painter is a respectable plumber, who gave her a
fresh coat at the beginning of the season; and the captain's gig-if
he happens to keep one—is a tilbury. Going before the wind, is
starting off rather earlier when a breeze is expected, and a ship's
papers are the tickets given on the payment of their fares to the
passengers. Three bells is the sign of a public house at Putney, and
boxing the compass is putting the compass away in a box until it is
wanted.
Joseph Snooks—Is a linen-draper's assistant, and has often
travelled in the river steam-boats; generally wears arowing shirt,and
sits on the top of the paddle-box. Does not know how many passengers
a boat will hold, but thinks there is no limit—at least he never saw any
attempt made to put any. So, as the vessel keeps above water, pre-
sumes it must be safe. Has seen it roll from side to side, owing to
the number of people, but thought it good fun, because it reminded
him of the Nore—which he once passed in going to Margate. Does
not know if he went to Margate in a larger boat. Forgets how high
it was above the water. Thinks it must have been more than two
inches. Fancies it must have been three. Is sure that the river-
boat was not above one-and-a-half, when it was rolling about on the
occasion when he thought it good fun. Is sure of that, because the
water came on to the feet of the passengers. He did not care,
because he was on the paddle-box. Did not know whether a sudden
movement might have upset the boat. He did not think of that at
the time. Believed himself to be a great patron of the aquatic
interests, for he went often during the season up and down by the
fourpenny boats. Had been in a collision. Rather liked it. Did not
exactly know why, but thought it was good fun—because it made the
women scream. Had been under one of the arches of Westminster
Bridge when the water was so high that the boat would hardly go
under. It shaved off the chimney, the two paddle-boxes, and the
hats of all the taller passengers. Did not like that quite so well.
Did not talk generally to the man at the wheel, because it was gene-
rally a boy—who also ran for ginger-beer, if any was wanted by a
passenger. Did not know how the vessel was steered, when the boy
left the wheel. Supposes the Captain regulated its course by walking
about the paddle-box.
Several other witnesses were examined, but their testimony was
devoid of interest.
SIGHTS SEEN BY NICHOLAS.
It may be remembered that, as a part of the hospitality of St.
James's towards Nicholas, a favoured policeman was, in the hand-
somest manner, placed at the EMPERoR's disposal—a fidus Achates
from the chosen Letter A. This good man (whose name we are not
yet in possession of) deserves well not only of Russia but of England,
Seeing that Nicholas was wasting much of his valuable time,
choosing toothpicks and breast-pins at Stona and MoRTIMER’s—
criticising the door-handles of Apsley House, and uttering small-
talk to the MARchioness of LonDoNDERRY-the said policeman
intimated to the EMPERoR that there were other English matters
(which he should be too happy to show and explain to him) equally
worthy of the Imperial consideration. Whereupon the EMPERoR, in
the blandest manner, placed himself at the policeman's disposal.
The Court Circular has been singularly silent on the matter; but the
couple sallied out together, unaccompanied by any other person.
The policeman, desirous of shewing to Nicholas a most favourable
illustration of the wholesome freedom of the press, brought him to
our office, and purchasing our last, (which may, indeed, be called the
EMPERoR's number) explained to Russia the various cuts in Punch,
and then, immediately translating us into very fluent French—(the
policeman, be it understood, had in his day been a dramatist)—made
a serious impression on the Imperial mind. Indeed, as the EMPERoR
took the whole of our number to his heart, he may be said to have
unconsciously lithographed it.
The EMPERon, having seen a specimen of English liberty of the
press, was next taken to the sheriff's court; where his guide ex-
plained to him—shewing the twelve men in the box—the whole pro-
cess of trial by jury.
After this, the policeman led his imperial Majesty to the Court of
Queen's Bench, where the EMPERon was lucky enough to hear a
motion made for a writ of habeas corpus.
We will not vouch for imperial sincerity, but N1cholas professed
himself to be much moved by these things; and when he returned to
the Russian Embassy—he, with something like a tear freezing in the
corner of his eye, presented to his guide and instructor, a gold snuff-
box, filled with sovereigns.
The reader will feel a pleasurable emotion in learning that the
policeman (noble fellow !) immediately sent both box and sovereigns
to Lord Dupley STUART, to be devoted to the Poles; who may
certainly receive the golden gift, it having been purified in its transit
from the EMPERoR by the honest hand of Letter A.
Mr. Moon and the Emperor of Russia.
“MR. SHERipp Moon,” we find, from the Court Circular, “paid his
ts to the EMPERoR of Russia, on Thursday, through his Excellency
Banon BRsNow.” We know very well that Moon would go through any-
thing to poke himself upon the notice of royalty. BARon Bavnow must
have been dreadfully bored by having the sheriff's respects sent right
through him to his imperial master. Ma. Moon will never be able to
approach royalty, on account of his own personal claims ; it can only be
through something or somebody, apart from himself, that he ever can
succeed in doing so. We would, however, prefer that he should make a
thoroughfare of a Russian Baron, than use British art as a medium for
thrusting himself on the attention of royalty.
RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE.
OMNIBuses have been put upon the Station to meet the trains of the
Kensington Railway. The meetings have hitherto been strictly private,
no one being present but the Driver of the Omnibus and the Guard of
the Railway.

STATISTICS OF WATERLOO BRIDGE.
We are happy to find that the annuitants upon this Bridge are this year
to get exactly eight-pence more than they did last, for the few hundreds
which they have sunk—below the very foundations, we suspect—in this
noble structure. The report was, of course, exceedingly glowing in its
language about the increase of eight-pence to the dividends, which, as they
amounted to only eleven and four-pence before, made a very serious ad-
dition to the profits 1
It appeared, that since the last meeting, the tolls had risen partly from
agentleman at Kennington having started his gig, and partly from a trades-
man in the Blackfriars-road, who keeps a cart, having got a new customer
in the vicinity of Covent Garden. These and other causes had added the
eight-pence to the eleven and four-pence, which was the amount of last
year's surplus.
The report went on to build a variety of aerial castles, the foundation of
all of which appeared to be, that the Bridge might pay at some time or
another.
A romantic allusion was made to some new street, which it was pre-
sumed would set people scampering over Waterloo Bridge, who at present
never thought of going there.
Qur old friend, Romeo CoATEs, made the best suggestion on the subject,
which was, to dispose of it by lottery; though if the expenses are, as was
asserted, £20,000 a year, we pity the fortunate winner of the property.
Perhaps if GeoRGE Robins could knock it all down at once, it would be
the best lot that could befall it.
THE DREAM OF JOINVILLE.
ontinental gossip says, that the PRunce
De Joinville having had a row with his
royal father, concerning his famous pam-
F.". rushed away to Saint Cloud, where
e slept at an inn, and dreamed the fol-
lowing dream :—
+ x - -
STEAlthily we speed along
I and my black steamers,
None can see the colours three
Painted on our streamers.
Not a star is in the sky,
Black and dull and silent;
Stealthily we creep along
Towards the wicked Island 1
Ne'er an English ship is out
Somehow to defend it;
So we reach the Thames's mouth—
Swiftly we ascend it.
Then I give a lesson fit
To Albion perfidious;
Properly I punish it,
For its treasons hideous.
Swiftly down the Thames we go,
All pursuit outstripping,
Blowing every village up,
Burning all the shipping.
Fancy Ramsgate in a blaze,
Margate pier a-dropping,
Woolwich burnt, and red-hot shot
Plunging into Wapping !
London town’s a jolly place,
England's pride and wonder;
Mortal eyes have never seen
Such a place for plunder.
Lord it is a glorious night
As my steamers pretty
Moor there, and my lads and I
Pour into the City.
“Here's enough for each, says I,
Whatsoe'er his rank, lads,
PIERRE shall rifle Lombard Street,
And JEAN shall gut the Bank, lads;
Every seaman in my crews,
Shall take as much as suits his
Wish, and needs but pick and choose
From Jones and Loyo's to Coutts's.
When my speech the seamen hear,
Each man does salute his
Admiral with loyal cheer,
And then begins his duties.
Some burn down the Monument,
And some the Tower invest, sir;
Some bombard the Eastern ond,
And some attack the West, sir.
Gods 1 it is a royal sight,
All the town in flames is
Burning, all the way from Wlite-
Chapel to Saint James's 1
See the Mayor, in cotton cap,
Asking what the blaze meant 1
When we hang his worship up,
Fancy his amazement
Kill me every citizen,
But spare their pretty spouses;
Hang me the policemen up
At the station-houses.
Beat St. Paul's with red-hot balls,
Set Temple Bara-blazing;
Burn me Paper Buildings down,
And Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn.
List to no man's prayers and vows,
Grant to none their pardons;
- BioMFIELD hang at London House,
PEEl at Whitehall Gardens.
Apsley House is stormed and won,
Seize the Iron Duke, boys;
Have him out, and hang him up
To the lantern—hook, boys |
Gods, it is a noble flame !
Now my fellows thunder
At the gates of Buckingham—
How the PRINCE does wonder.
Out he comes with sword and lance;
Boys, stand back, impartial,
See an Admiral of France
Pink an English Marshall
Tell us who's the best at blows,
The Army or the Navy
Carte and Tierce 1 and down he goes;
Albert cries, “Peccavi.”
“Spare my precious husband's life:”
The Queen upon her knees is,
The little Princes kneeling round
In their night-chemises.

Just as I had raised my arm
To finish Albion's ruin,
Came a cock, and crow'd a cursed
Cock-a-doodle-dooing.
It was morning, and I lost
That delightful vision—
Cruel morning, to dispel
Such a dream Elysian I
The King of Saxony and the Prince of Wales:
“The members of the family of Saxe Coburg are all Dukes of Saxony,”
says the Observer, “and the King of Saxony recognised in the infant
PRINCE of Wales one of his future nobles.” We should suggest that the
recognition be made the subject of an historical painting. Saxony in the
act of starting back with surprise and delight, would fill up the fore-
ground ; while the future noble, in a high nursery chair, would give a
richness to the back-ground, and admit of a quantity of fore-shortening
in the infant's legs, which a great artist would know how to handle.
A hint To PhRENOLOGISTR.
On the first day of the EMPERoR of Russia's arrival, he visited Srona
and MoRTIMER's, and ordered jewellery to the amount of £6,000. The
second day, the nobility rushed in hundreds to call upon the Emperor.
How largely the bump of “snuff-box-ativeness” must be developed in
our aristocracy 1

An ass, some geese, and cousin's spotted sows.

(You imp ! How very obstinate you are!)
A PLOT 1–RUSSIA’S TROUSERS.
“You’re a clever fellow ! Who made your breeches f" In the
course of our long and useful life, we have frequently heard this
sentence—indeed, who has not —but could never make out the
legitimate connection between the assertion and the interrogative.
A late event helps somewhat to explain the matter to us; to show
that there is an inevitable sympathy of littleness or greatness
between the tailor and his customer; to prove if an EMPERoR of
Russia be sagacious, passing the sagacity of ordinary men, that an
INkson, of Ryder-street, St. James's, must consequently be a tailor
watchful far beyond the ordinary brotherhood of tailors. He must
have an eye that winks not, an eye open as the eye of his own needle
—an intelligence, sharp and piercing as its point. Let the subjoined
Bow-street history prove the truth of this:–
“Count Ostkowski, a Pole, was held to bail on a charge of threatening to shoot the
Emperon or Russia. On Saturday, the CH kvali ER BENkh AusEN, the Russian
Consul, had an interview with Mr. JARD IN E on the subject. Some mystery is made
of the Police proceedings.”
Count Ostrowski himself has sent a statement to the Morning
Chronicle, of which this is the kernel —
“On Monday last, Count Ostrowski called at his tailor's, Mr. INkson's, in Ryder
Street, St. James's ; and, observing a pair of trousers of rather striking appearance
lying on the counter, he happened to inquire for whom they were intended. He was
informed they had been ordered by the EMPER or Nicholas; at which Count Ostrow-
ski expressed some surprise, and added, in a jocular manner, he should like to have
the trying of them on. Ms. Inkson converted this remark into a threat against the
life of his imperial customer.”
The pair of trousers was of striking appearance; that is, they
were made of singularly exquisite Saxony—a touching compliment
from Nicholas to his brother monarch and fellow-guest—and hence
excited the innocent curiosity of the Count ; who, his question being
answered, thereupon made a jocular remark. The event shews that
no man should joke with tailors. They are—CHARLEs LAMB has
proved it—a serious, saturnine race, ever baking their blood with the
hot thoughts of politics. MR. Inkson immediately converted the
Count's innocent joke into a deadly threat. If the man—thought MR.
INkson, with an eye to the moralist Johnson—who makes a pun will
pick a pocket, why, it is a natural deduction that the man who will
utter a rollicking joke will shed blood. MR. In kson (a cruel com-
pliment to the Count) saw no difference between his jokes and
bullets; they were of one and the same material,—and hence an
appeal to Bow-street 1
We have no doubt that the now widely-known sagacity of IN kson
will greatly enlarge his business. A tailor who can “convert” things
as he can, must be invaluable to a very large body of customers, who
with limited means would make the most of their apparel. What a
genius he must have for turning; arriving at the conclusions he
has, what a hand for fine-drawing !
There lie the innocent Saxony trousers, “of rather striking appear-
ance,” on INkson's shopboard, when a Polish Count utters a joke,
and immediately INkson sees in the nether apparel, trousers
“Cut i' the eclipse, and sewed with curses dark : **
All sorts of horrors rush into the tailor's brain. The desperate
Pole may waylay the shopman on his road to the EMPERon, and an
arrangement having been made with his showman, the republican
BARNu M for the purpose, GENERAL ToM THUMB, armed to the teeth,
maybe insinuated into the watch-fob, and when there strike a mortal
blow at the imperial vitals | With these thoughts, what could
Inkson do but fly to JARDINE The sagacious act was worthy even
of Nicholas. Indeed, it would seem to only emanate from a tailor,
fully alive to the measures of the EMPERoh.
The historical moral of all this is, let no man joke on the trou-
sers of emperors. They are serious, solemn things, not to be
lightly spoken of Indeed, if King Duncan were among us, we much
doubt if it would be safe, in the presence of an Inverness Inkson
—to risk so much as a pun upon the royal kilt.
It is, however, soothing to our spirits—after the flutter they have
suffered—to record, as a bright conclusion to the dark tale of con-
spiracy, the gratitude of man. The EMPERoR of Russia has, in
the handsomest manner, forwarded to MR. IN kson, tailor—as at
once the reward and the emblem of his sagacity—a golden goose.
May it lay golden eggs, for Inkson's children's children to sit upon I
A SORRY MONARCH.
(To Punch, or whatever he calls himself.)
Ellow, Happening to take up the last number
of your truly worthless and contemptible
journal which, I perceive, is devoted to the
ridicule of everything that is great and admi-
rable, I observed in it, with extreme disgust,
several articles and caricatures tending to the
disparagement, not only of that illustrious
and excellent monarch, the EMPERoR of
Russia, but also of those sacred principles of
which he is the representative and champion.
It is quite plain that you are putting your-
self forward as the antagonist of social order;
and I am the more confirmed in this opinion by seeing what pains
you have been also taking to bring into contempt and derision that
most useful body of men, the Beadlery of England. You are the
worthy ally of those good-for-nothing idle varlets whose infant sedition
and liberalism are vented in the scorn of parochial authority. It
were vain to request that you would suppress your impertinences;
|but if you must indulge in them at the expense of your superiors,
there is one crowned head on which you might crack your jokes with
comparative decency—I mean, that of the King of Saxony. Here is
a man, who, utterly forgetful of his dignity as a Sovereign, and regard-
less of the example of his Royal fellows—the Princes of the Earth
— demeans himself by prosecuting science 1 Cannot a King find
something better to prosecute than that He actually cultivates botany
and geology; and, what is worse, for their own sakes. Had he any poli-
tical, or other sensible motive for so doing, it would be another matter.
What has a King to do with geology His business is to rule his land,
and not to find out what it is made of, supposing that possible, which it is
not, for everybody knows that geology is all humbug. Of what use is
botany to a Prince Instead of going poking about in the fields and hedges,
and rooting up chickweed and stinging-nettles, he ought to employ himself
in weeding out bad and refractory subjects; such, Mr. Punch, as impudent
and mischievous scribblers. Let him copy the wise, good, and much-abused
Nicholas, who has transplanted so many of such weeds to Siberia. Not
only is the King or Saxony given up to the low and unkingly pursuits of
science and literature, but like most others who are so, he has a grovelling,
paltry contempt for all those splendours and glories of a Court which are
so necessary to command the veneration of a great people, and which are
intrinsically so imposing to a lofty mind. He affects to avoid parade and
ostentation ; which is an implied insult to the aristocracy of this country.
He is said, too, to be religious, without bigotry. Religion, of course, is
highly proper; but appearances must be observed as well: and, to my
certain knowledge, he was seen the other day at the Bavarian Chapel, say-
ing his prayers, and apparently minding nothing else, and, withal, so plainly
dressed, that several persons mistook an officer of his suite, sitting behind
him in a blue surtout with frogs, for himself. As to his being without
bigotry, that, of course, means, that he lets everybody in his dominions
think as they please; which is horrible. We are told, moreover, that he is
humane and enlightened. Humanity and enlightenment are all nonsense;
and I am convinced they will be the ruin of this country. Then he is benefi-
cent, they say, to the extent of his limited resources. Beneficent, indeed 1
Limited resources ! Yes:–of course his resources must be limited, so
long as he chooses to follow his own counsels, to fly in the face of his order,
and to act in contravention of that grand maxim of all government, that
the people are made for the Prince, not the Prince for the people. And
what respect is due to a King with “limited resources t” The truth is, he
might make a very good physician, or lawyer, or clergyman, or writer, or
philosopher ; but he is not fit to be a King at all.
One word, fellow, at parting. You twit the beloved and august Nicholas
a great deal with the knowt. In my opinion it is an exceedingly useful
instrument, and I very much wish it could be introduced into this country,
if but for the sake of keeping such as you and your confederates in order.
You may laugh; but if I had my way, you should laugh on the other side
of your mouth. I am, &c.

RUSSIA AND RUSSIA’S BEAR.
oubtless it is known that the EMPEROR of Russia
visited the Zoological Gardens in the Park. It
is equally well known that he has an extra-
ordinary memory ef persons whom he has once
seen. Thus, the EMPERoR, looking down into
tº the bear's pit, immediately reeognised a brown
* bear that, in its cubhood, he had seen at St. Pe-
tersburgh: and, strange to add, the bear as
readily knew the EMPERoR. Hastily climbing to
the top of the pole, the sagacious beest began to
growl the very purest Russian, and was answered in its native sounds
by Nicholas. The following may be depended upon as a faithful
translation of the colloquy :—
Bear. Bless my heart : What, Nicholas !
Emperor. What, you remember me !
Bear. Remember you ! What bear, with a liking for blood, could ever
forget you? Ha, sire this, after all, is a sorry country.
Emperor. Why, you look sleek and fat.
Bear. But what fat I’ve very little of my natural victuals. All my
Russian courage is taken out of me with buns and biscuits, that short
commons of flesh compels me to eat; buns and biscuits from the hands of
girls and babies, and that, too, when my mouth waters for one of them.
Ha, how I could relish even a hard old Pole !
Emperor (with a dim smile). I think you have one.
Bear (with a knowing wink). Pooh you know what I mean. But
now, to talk of yourself. Ar’n’t you afraid to shew your nose in England
Those rascally newspapers And then that scoundrel, Punch / They
blab everything. 'Twas only yesterday that I saw a sweet little boy in a
white frock ...; red shoes : I Ž. I could have dined upon him—for the
nursery-maid was giggling with a Life Guardsman—but then, again, I
knew the rumpus there'd have been. First, that WAKLEY, and then an
inquest, and then a bullet through my body; and so these rascally
English would not only have had my blood upon their heads, but my
grease too. And so, thinking of all this, with tears in my eyes, I munched
a dry biscuit, and let the child—ha! you should have seen its chubby legs;
amongst all the babies you stole from Warsaw, there wasn't a fatter one
—and so, with a sigh, I let the child be.
Emperor (laying his hand on his bosom). I can feel for you.
Bear. But to speak about yourself. Ar’n’t you afraid to come where
the newspapers have made your reputation so well known 1
Emperor (significantly touching his pockets). Not in the least.
Bear. The folks here know all about your doings at Warsaw.
Emperor. What of that ? I shall give an order for a gold service—and
buy some jewellery, too—at SroRR AND MoRTIMER's.
Bear. They know, too, of the Poles—whose patriotism was their guilt
—whom you have sent to Siberia :
Emperor. Very well. I shall subscribe five hundred pounds for a
yearly cup at Ascot, and the mob there will cheer me—and fling up their
caps—and want to hug me in their arms for the dearest, the sweetest, of
emperors—a piece of legitimate anatomy, filled with ichor; with no stain,
no rank odour of blood upon me. HKnow John BULL; he blusters well
enough; but he'd bear strokes with a lacquered, shining face, from the
knout itself, if it were only made of gold.
Bear. Nick, you know a thing or two.
Emperor. And so, you see, I shall give some money for an annual piece
of plate to be raced for. And after that to talk of the Poles Pooh t
John Bull at such a time doats too much upon horse-flesh to think of the
flesh of a few thousands of men, women, and children.
E #: Nevertheless, your character is in such bad odour with these
nºxius
Éºry. Nonsense you are over-anxious for me. I know them.
They abuse me when I’m at St. Petersburgh, but they love rank too well
when it comes to them to question its little failings. If the Prince of
Darkness himself were to come as a Prince, there are plenty of people
here—high ones, too—to cheer him for his horns and tail.
Bear. Well, Nicholas, your reception will go far to test that fact.
Emperor. And then when John Bull would act meanly, inconsistently,
he can always lay his hand upon a pet virtue to cloak himself with. Thus,
he will feast me, and hurrah to me, and swear that he is only civil from
his excessive hospitality. But then John knows I'm rich—immensely
rich ; and with all his far-seeing, telescopic philosophy, he can see no spots
in a golden sun; no, but Christian as he is, worships it like any Persian.
And then, because I'm an emperor, I shall be feasted by Whigs and
Tories; and men who abuse me in Parliament, will, if I vouchsafe so
much, kiss my hand—yes, my felon hand, branded by Lucifer with
** Poland.”
Bear. I hope you may find it so. º the way, too, it happens very
unluckily that they're going to give a ball to the Poles.
Is it really you?
Emperor. Not at all—it all makes for my game. I shall talk to the
Lady Patronesses, and offer to give them any money for their very bene-
volent purpose. And then I shall be praised for my forbearance—my
humanity.
Bear. Very likely. Just as if a man, who had set fire to his neigh-
bour's house-killed his wife and children—stolen his goods, and left him
naked in the highway,+hould, touched by sudden humanity, magnani-
mously bestow upon #. wretch a pair of garters.
Emperor. Exactly.
Bear. Nevertheless, there is this untoward matter to get over. You
talk about going amongst the lady aristocracy of England—the lovely,
the refined, the tender. How will you get out of that very black business
—the flogging of Polish women?
Emperor. Nothing more easy. I shall bow and smile at the Opera.
And here ended the talk between Nicholas and the Bear.

This picture is interesting, less as a specimen of art, than as an historical
portrait, which will hand down the true character of the PRINCE de Join-
ville to posterity more faithfully than could be done by the pen of the
historian.
This amiable PRINCE is represented in the costume of a French Corsair
—carrying out the principles of his own pamphlet, by that happy union of
fire and sword, bombs and bombast, which are so congenial to his happy
disposition. There is not the smallest doubt that the PRINCE looks at his
profession with the eye of an artist—a dramatic artist we mean—and that
in talking of an action he would be prepared to go heart and soul into those
little bits of valour—such as bullying a prisoner, or knocking down a
defenceless marine—which, with a naval hornpipe thrown in to impart a
certain degree of lightness, may be regarded as the chief points in the
composition of a stage seaman. -
The whole bearing of the portrait is valorous in the extreme. The
determined cocking of the pistol and the eye at the same moment ; the
firmness of the position; the unflinching sternness of the brow ; are all
truly characteristic when taken in conjunction with the fact that if the
PRInce were to look round him in all directions he could not catch o
glimpse of an enemy.

I held the ribbons and I plied the goad.

Unhappy swain one half my trouble’s gone,
To find I’m not in the wide world alone.
Say, shall we roam these furze-bespangled hills,
Together muse upon our common ills;
Together tend our soft, tick-bitten flocks,
And tell our sorrows to the list'ning rocks?
Buggins.
Donel MR. Thing UMBob—and I'm your man ;
We'll roam these dales, and share one flowing can,
One pot, one pipe, one bacca' box, one flock,
One crook, of mutton and of wool one stock.

List, “Gentle Shepherd?”—o'er the Hampstead hills
The milkmaid's voice, in lying numbers thrills,
Proclaims the produce of the dangling dug,
While chalk and water mingle in the mug H

The butcher's youth sustains th' ensanguin'd tray;
While, round us scatter'd, the short herbage crop

Then let us sing the progress of our lives,
While each for victory in numbers strives,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SLIGHTS OF SAXONY.
We are very much afraid that Saxony is being snubbed on account of
the presence of Russia, who appears to have completely put out of joint
the most prominent feature in the Saxon Monarch's countenance. To
re-set the royal nose would be to Punch a most delightful task, could he
only accomplish it. Russia is invited to breakfast everywhere, though he
can't go, while Saxony, who would only be “too happy,” is asked
nowhere. We regard this treatment as very unfair towards one, who,
though only “a third-rate power,” is a very gentlemanly fellow—a charac-
ter we have always heard of the snubbed, but good-humoured, SAxony.
When he visited West Cowes, three of the royal carriages were in attend-
ance upon him ; but when the rumour of Russia's arrival was spread,
nobody seemed to care what became of Saxony, who found himself at
Southampton, reduced to a common fly for the conveyance of his suite—
his luggage being actually taken by hand from the steam-boat. How
the suite that had occupied three carriages at West Cowes, contrived to
cram themselves into one fly at Southampton, is more than we can under-
stand. The treatment, altogether, that Saxony has received, appears to
us to be very ungenerous. It is fortunate for us he is only a third-rate
power, or we might “hear of it” in an awkward way at some future
period.

ENGLAND AND HER BEADLES.
THE BEADLES OF THE QUADRANT
Hough the Quadrant Beadlery is a
comparatively recent institution —
though the tip of the staff is not hal-
lowed by the rust of time—though the
Beadle's power cannot boast of that
antiquity which is supposed, like the
highness in the game, the decay in the
Cheshire cheese, or the ripeness in the
Stilton, to Inake it all the richer and
better—though the Beadle's chair has
not yet arrived at that palmy state of
rickets and craziness which, as indi-
cations of age, are presumed to give solidity, in spite of all this, the
Beadles of the Quadrant—we say Beadles in the plural, or rather
the dual, for there are two—in spite of all this, we repeat, the Beadles
of the Quadrant are very fair average Beadles in the long-run, and
they are by no means a disgrace to the order they have been lately
added to.
How the Quadrant, which had been, from the time of its first con-
struction, under no regular government, came to assume the shape of
a duarchy, would form an interesting nut for the application of the
crackers of research by the modern antiquarian. To ourselves we
confess it is a regular cocoa-nut, too large to be cracked off-hand by
the mere force of jaw, and not worth the trouble of hammering away
at with the mallet of perseverance. We therefore cease to ask how
the Beadles came to be Beadles, satisfied with the fact that Beadles
they are, and as Beadles we have a right to deal with them.
There has been a great deal said recently in Parliament and in the
Press about Young England, and there can be very little doubt that
this “Young England” spirit is to be found more or less in all ourin-
stitutions. Young England is not the only symptom of the new gener-
ation, as depicted by MR. D'Israeli in his lately-published novel of
Comingºby. No | We have Young Beadle as well as Young England,
and we have no hesitation in pointing to the Quadrant as the spot in
which Young Beadle is about to develope himself. There is the
same mixture of old forms with new ideas ; the same regard to per-
s-
*>.
the same love of fixed institutions (the Beadle's chair is chained to
the column), added to a desire for progress–
* Move on 1 ''
is ever the Beadle's cry—all these ideas, or entities, are, we repeat,
the same in Young Beadle as they are in Young England, and the
union of notions gives to the mind at once a picture and a parallel.
Having looked at the Quadrant Beadle in a constitutional light, let
us take a glance at him—or a squint at the pair—in a social point of
vision. The very publicity of his position will prevent Young Beadle
from abusing his power, as it also discourages his temporary subjects
—his dominions extend from Glasshouse Street to the County Fire—
from resisting it. If actual service were needed from either of these
Beadles, we say it most advisedly, that we doubt their nerve. We
believe them to be constitutionally timid, and useful only so far as
their uniform and staff are calculated to inspire terror in the minds
of the refractory. Perhaps, however, the Quadrant Beadles, on the
principle of two negatives having the force of an affirmative, may be
said to be powerful from the fact of their duplicity.
The Beadles are elected by a body, of whom a woollen-draper in
the neighbourhood is said to be the leader, and as it is a dealer in
Saxony broad cloth who has virtually the power to elect, the Beadles
may be said to be under vassalage to the Elector of Saxony. As it
is a rare, and must be an interesting sight to see a Beadle unbeadled,
we recommend the public to watch the Quadrant at about five in the
afternoon, when one of the Beadles may be seen at his tea, throwing
aside for a time the
“Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious Beadledom,”
his mind no longer immersed in the cares of office, but his nose
immersed in a pint of that salubrious decoction of four-and-ninepenny-
mixed, which is strongly recommended to families.
Pictorial Mediators,
WHEN the French do a good thing, we at lease have the sound taste
sometimes to copy them. It is said that the court of the Tuilleries sent
over HoRace VERNET, the painter, to bring about a reconciliation between
Nicholas and Louis Puilippe. Taking the hint, we are informed that
HER MAJESTY intends to despatch MacLise to Morocco to negotiate a
sonal dignity, blended with a condescending courtesy of demeanour;
peace between the African Emperor and the King of the Fasnch.

THE EMPEROR's cup.
N
So the EMPERoR of ALL the Russias has subscribed 500 guineas yearly for the
purchase of a piece of plate, to be run for at Ascot races. Well; this is hand-
some, certainly: England will be the richer by plate to the value of 500 guineas
per annum at the expense of Nicholas. The Autocrat has come down gallantly.
It was politically done. Henceforward let not a whisper be breathed against
him. Surely a donation of 500 guineas annually is an all-redeeming act of
virtue. We would canonise a Nero on the strength of it.
Qf course, the plate will have to be designed ; and, as necessarily, the design
will be a matter of competition. Under these circumstances, Punch, who would
have no objection to receive a couple of hundreds or so for an idea, has set to
work and devised a cup, which he proposes as the prize to be provided by the
Emperor.
Though a 500 guinea cup should, one might think, be composed entirely of
pure gold, yet Punch would have this slightly alloyed with silver, as well to
render it the more durable, as in regard, for an obvious reason, to the mines of
Siberia.
The utensil is to be supported on a skull; and its stem to be decorated with
carvings or small models of the knout; the same being emblematical of the foun-
dations of despotic government.
The sides of the cup to be garnished with festoons of fetters; ornaments
which may be regarded as the insignia of Autocracy.
On its sides various devices are to be engraven in bas-relief; one com-
gº." to contain a group of exiles, driven by the bayonets of soldiers to
iberia; the gold of the back ground being frosted, for the better indication of
On another are to be delineated young dress-makers and servants,
corporal punishment. A third is to exhibit a tableau of houses
or burning, with peasantry, women, and children, running away
the locality.

under a charge of cavalry. A fourth, the deportation of a Jewish
community, some in a state of semi-nudity, others characteristi-
cally attired in old clothes. The whole to typify the social and
political phenomena of Muscovite life.
The handles of the cup to consist of female forms in Polish
attire, weeping into the bowl ; females, Polish or otherwise, being
very apt to weep when they are bereaved or turned out of doors;
and especially if they are whipped into the bargain.
Hurrah for Nicholas ! He is an Emperor worth more than
five hundred sovereigns—a year to us. He has given a very
splendid cup to John Bull, who, of course, will “bury all unkind.
ness” in it.
A LITTLE BILL.
(For the accommodation of anti-Gambling Legislators.)
“&Ibereas, an Act for the Prevention and Suppression of
Gambling hath been already for some time in operation, and hath
lately been successfully acted on, to the downfall of thimbleriggers
and the discomfiture of Art Unions, by means whereof a great
many fools, who would otherwise have parted with their money,
have been caused to retain the same in their pockets, or perad-
venture to spend it in something like a sensible way:
Ønt ſubcreas it is expedient that all manner of gambling,
of what name and description, soever, be utterly and entirely
suppressed, prevented, and abolished : -
Ønt further, tubercas divers and sundry subjects of Her most
gracious Majesty Wicrobia, being seised and possessed of wealth or
of title, or of both, do notoriously waste the one and disgrace the
other by various acts and proceedings which are plainly and con-
fessedly neither more nor less than downright gambling at the very
best, and do in many cases involve extensive cheating and scoun-
drelism into the bargain:
33c it (Enacted, for the self-preservation of fools of distinction,
the protection of their wives and families, the better security of
their estates from mortgage, and of their goods and chattels from
Jews and Sheriffs' officers; also for the encouragement of the
breed of horses, and the extinction of that of black-legs and other
swindlers, That from and after the passing of this Act, it shall be
lawful for no manner of person or persons, under any pretence
whatsoever, to play any game of chance or hazard; whether with
cards, dice, dominoes, counters, pieces, or any sort or descrip-
tion of implements, for money or goods: And be it enacted, That
no person or persons shall stake or venture any sum of money, or
any amount of goods or property, on any stand, race-course, in
any betting-room, or other place, on any horse, mare, colt, pony,
mule, ass, or any other beast or animal : And whereas certain
persons, subjects of Her said Majesty, do sometimes unlawfully
meet together, and contend with their fists, till one, by reason
of his wounds and bruises, shall confess himself beaten, or do
struggle for the mastery in running, leaping, wrestling, or other
feats of strength and agility, or in the shooting of certain fowl
denominated pigeons and sparrows: 33c it &martet, That it shall
be unlawful for any person or persons to lay, with respect to
the issue of such contention, struggle, or competition, any sort or
kind of wager : And further, whereas other certain persons, also
subjects of Her aforesaid Majesty, do, at the Stock Exchange and
elsewhere, venture and hazard enormous sums in divers and
sundry speculations, by means whereof they, with their wives,
families, and dependents, are oftentimes reduced to beggary in one
moment: 33c it (ºnattrú, That no person or persons shall be suf-
fered so to hazard and venture any sum of money, except by way
of lawful investment; for which provision shall be made hereafter :
And lastly, 33c it (Emartcu, That any person or persons offending
against any of the provisions of the above Act, shall incur and be
liable to the pains and penalties of gambling.”
Punch is sorry to deprive any nobleman or gentleman of in.
nocent recreation ; but the legislature, which would restrain the
immorality of the poor, should be equally considerate with regard
to the rich.
Joining Issue.
THE French papers are continually complaining that England
never makes any advances to France. Now we contend that the
very fact of the Dover pier being carried out further into the
sea every year, is a proof to the contrary, and shows most forcibly
that England is willing to meet France at least half-way. Let
France on its side only do the same from Calais, and the Straits
that at present divide the two countries will be most practically
removed, and the union between them cemented in a most literal,
and, if the sea will allow it, a most permanent manner.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SIR. R. PEEL AT THE REVIEW.
It was the general remark at the Windsor Review, that SIR Robsat
PEEL, the only individual out of uniform, pranced about considerably in
advance of the EMPERoR of Russia and the other royal personages—as
much as to say, “Look at me, I take the lead in everything.” Whether
it was, that the military array frightened the Premier's horse, or that the
Premier desired to keep at a respectful distance from the drawn swords
of some of the staff, certain it is, that he cantered on first amid the sup-

pressed titter of the soldiers, and to the utter amazement of the lookers-on
among the public. Sir Robert, as everybody knows, likes to ride the
high horse when he can, and it is a complaint with some of his old Tory
allies that he is going on rather too fast—a charge which he was certainly
liable to, on the day when he most uncourteously preceded two crowned
heads during the review at Windsor.
PUNCH AND MR. GEORGE JONES.
LL our readers must recollect a letter of MR.
George Jones published in Punch. MR. Jones,
at a meeting of the members of the British
and Foreign Institute, has declared that letter
to be a forgery. The signature, nevertheless,
he avows to be a fac-simile of his own. We
shall do all in our power to test the authenticity
of the document, and, therefore, inform MR.
Jon Es, and all whom it may concern, what we
have already done, and what we further propose
to do.
Ere this sheet shall greet the eyes of the world,
the letter to Punch, signed GeoRGE Jones, will have been litho-
graphed, and a copy of the document despatched to every member of
the British and Foreign Institute. By this means the envious will
be enabled to observe if the signature of MR. GEoRGE Jones, (which
he acknowledges), and the body of his epistle, be of one and the same
character.
We shall furthermore cause the original document to be framed
and glazed at our printing-office, for the satisfaction of the empire at
large, and of MR. Jon Es in particular.
Forgery is a grave charge; and if, in proving our guiltlessness of
such enormity, or even of our careless participation in the fault of
others, we use very straightforward measures painful to MR. Jones,
however we may lament the cause, we cannot help it. As Punch's
old friend Cardinal Wolsey says—
“'Tis the rough brake that virtue must go through.”

The cause is now PUNch versus GEoRGE Jones; and heaven
send the innocent “a good deliverance.”

THE “ INDUSTRIOUS FLEAS” TO PUNCH.
RoM two of the “Industrious Fleas” Punch has
received a very touching note—a note, as he
conceives, of very just complaint. It is as
follows:—
“MR. Punch.—Many of the public who
have visited us, have been loud in their talk
touching a certain dwarf known as Tom
THUMB, who, on the score of his exceeding
Majesty and the Royal Family; giving great
delight to them by his imitations of the
Emperor Napoleon. The force of contrast
was, of course, the great charm of such
mimicry; that anything so ridiculously small
should imitate such royal greatness, was the
- fun of the thing, and nothing more.
“Now, Ma, Punch, is the Queen ignorant of the fact that she has
among her subjects, industrious Fleas? Is she not aware that, for
years past,-a fact constantly published to the out-door world by
pictorial placards,-two of us have imitated not only Napoleon, but
Napoleon's charger And if diminutiveness is to be a passport to
the palace, surely myself and friend have a more legitimate right to
the entrée even than To M THUMB. Besides, we have other claims.
“We were both of us for some time, as they say in the Court Circular,
about the person’ of the Emperor at St. Helena; whence, after
many adventures, we were brought to England in the blankets of
SIR. Hudson Lowe, and were ultimately disposed of for sixpence
each, on account of our size and intelligence, to our present pro-
prietor.
“As we have heard that Her Majesty is a constant and improving
reader of Punch, we have written to you that our complaint may
meet the royal eye; and to state that, being infinitely smaller things
than ToM THUMB, we, the Industrious Fleas, shall be happy as
NApoleon and his Horse to have a night with the Royal Family.
“Awaiting their commands,
“We loyally remain,
* The NApoleon FLEA AND His CHARGER.”
APPROACHING EXHIBITION AT WESTMINSTER HALL.
ExtENsive preparations are being made for the opening of the Exhibi-
tion of Statuary, &c., at Westminster Hall, and several cart-loads of
masonry have been conveyed thither to the immense astonishment of the
legal functionaries, who imagined that the tremendous packages done up
in brown Holland were articles to be “put in,” as the legal phrase goes, as
roofs of something or other in some of the causes being tried at the Sittings.
W. caught a glimpse of the helmet of BRITANNIA protruding from a very
large brown pinafore, and we fancied we recognised the nose of JANE
Shore peeping from beneath a sheet, which, by-the-bye, it may be
intended she should wear during the exhibition, in order to keep her in
strict accordance with history. HENRY THE Eighth was done up in
brown paper, and arrived most ignobly by the Parcels Delivery ; while, to
add to the awful desecration, there was a row between the company's cad
and the door-keeper of the Hall about the payment of the carriage.
Rufus was conveyed in a hamper with no top to it, while William The
CoNQUEROR came in a complete suit of haybands.
Iºussia's Tribute to Nelson.
Nicholas has left £500 towards the completion of the Nelson column.
We understand that a petition has been presented from the Greenwich
Pensioners, praying that the money shall be returned ; or if not, that
it shall be appropriately distributed among the convicts of Woolwich,
giving the highest share to the most notorious footpads, burglars, and
child-stealers.
Claude Duval Rivalled.
The RE is a story of that gallant highwayman, CLAUDE DuvAL, that,
having stopped a gentleman and his wife upon the road, and robbed them
of everything, he afterwards in the most charming and fascinating way,
treated them to a tune on his fiddle, on which, says history, he was an
expert performer The EMPERoR of Russia, ere he offered a subscrip-
tion to the Polish Ball, had doubtless heard of this story. Having
stripped his victims of possessions, home, and country, he had still no
objection to stand a little music.

|right of search, and a species of inquisitorial vigilance, forcibly bringing
to mind the terrors of the Spanish Inquisition in the very centre of Great
Russell-street. He is empowered to seize sticks and umbrellas, with a
rapacious hand, from persons going in, and to search pockets, reticules, or
muffs, of persons going out, lest any of them should be attempting to carry
off the Elgin marbles, the celebrated Siamese stopper, the fossil flea,
or any other of the precious relics which enrich this glorious piece of
Inigo-Jonesian architecture. What INIGo Jones did for doors, WREN did
for windows, and BARRY has subsequently done for chimney-pots. But
we are forgetting the Beadle : on the whole he exercises his great
power with firmness (towards boys), tempered by discretion (towards
grown-up people). He makes it, we believe, his boast, that during all the
exciting period of the Easter Monday of '42, he did not allow one um-
brella to escape his eye, nor one boy in a pinafore to obtain admission.
JOHN BULL RINGED BY RUSSIA.
FROM the quantity of jewellery given away by Nicholas on his late
visit, it is evident that he thinks the surest way to lead John Bull by the
nose, is to put a diamond ring in it.
