PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THEY rode into Berlin in triumph, the grand new Emperor and the brave Cbown Prince. The pen of Walter
Scott, whose memory is about to be nobly honoured in Britain, might register the thoughts of tbe illustrious
father and son.
"What spell was good King 'William's,' say?
• •••••
His was the patriot's burning thought
Of Freedom's battle bravely fought,
Of castles stormed, of cities freed,
Of deep design, and daring deed."
The same poet might tell us of the thoughts that occupied the gallant Prince's mind, only the famous passage
in the Lord of the Isles does not exactly apply in his case; in fact, it does not apply at all; and though this is a
trifle, it is well to be careful about trifles. We will assume, however, that Fritz was thinking of his charming Prin-
cess, who was just then looking "the incarnation of health and happiness."
They rode along in glory, when the Royal pair became aware of a Presence, which came between them. There
was a benignant and affable countenance, pertaining to one who had ridden in, dividing father from son.
"Where's Moltke?" was the new-comer's bland yet peremptory demand.
"Who is this Person?" said the Empebor, looking, yet only for a moment, as if he were about to order the
stranger to be blown away from Krupp's very largest steel gun, with an extra charge. Then the divine instinct which
exists in anointed Sovereigns of the right kind came upon him, and he grew conscious that he beheld a superior. He
was about to dismount, and pay homage after the fashion of the Hermit (in Mr. Parnell's famous poem)—
"When the strange Partner seemed no longer Man,"
but the Partner calmly said,
"All right, Imperial Majesty, keep your saddle. Speech taken as read, my brave. How do you do, Fritz?
But where's Moltke?"
"Why, it is dear old Punch!" said Frederio William Nicholas Charles, K.G.
"Of course it is; but none so old, young Prince. Behold this gambado!" Here he .caused his gallant steed
to execute a remarkable feat. "Could you do it better, valiant horseman that you are?"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"Nearly off, though," said the Prince.
"You 're another," said Mr. Punch. "How well your Serene Father is looking."
"This is Punch, Sire," said Telemachus to Ulysses.
The grand old Monarch gave one eagle-glance at the grander Creature beside him.
"Halt the whole Army!" exclaimed the Emperor, With a voice for wonder, Like tho roar of the Thunder,
When he shouts to a stormy sea. "Wave all the banners, fire off all the cannons, and every man bellow Hock f and
Hooray! Take the time from me!"
The mighty noise that followed was heard in Paris, and it so astounded M. Thiers that he countermanded the
Eeview which was to be hold on the next Sunday. When asked why he had done this, he said, that he thought
Sunday would be a wet day.
"Thanks," said Mr. Punch, when the echoes had begun to resume their tranquillity, and the stunned birds had
ceasod to fall from the upper vault. "And where is Moltke?"
"Mr. Punch," Said the Emperor, reining up his glorious and impatient war-charger, "I am not a man of
many words: Which I wish to remark, And my language is plain; that you have been the Homer of this War."
"I have;" said Mr. Punch, modestly. "Likewise its VniaiL and its Tasso, not to say its Milton."
H You have been the Milton of the second War," said Fritz, "and marvellously have you recorded the Battle
of the Demoni."
"You are a very superior kind of young man," said Mr. Punch, "and you have said the thing which is
right; and where is Moltke?"
^ Punch/' said the Emperor, l< you did all you could to prevent the War. \rou wanied the Emperor of the
FrencM. When the duel was on, you did justice to the valour on both sidei. When Germany's feats were noblest,
you imnlortaiised them. In the hour of victory you interceded for the vanquished, and now you gracefully come to
adorn the triumph of the conquerors. You are welcome, indeed."
I knew I should be welcome, or i had not cdme. Emperok, I congratulate you. Prince, you are happy in
having taken your laurel from the white hand of VicfcrftiA Adelaide Mary Louisa of England. Now, where's
Moltke?"
"Here he comes!" laughed tho Royal couple.
The Wise and Silent Man approached, and Mr. Punch—like Erminia when she saw the wounded Tancred—
"stepped not, no, he darted from his seat."
But he spoke not. Nor did ho who can bo silent in seven languages, speak. One raised his hat. The other
winked. And this was all that passed between them, as Moltke received from Punch his

WHAT WE WANT IN OUR POLICEMEN.
L Great agility, to Catch the Criminal. 2. TmnUHM physical strength, to Overpower him. 3. An acute and well-disciplined intellect, so as never to Take Up the Wrong Person.
These Characteristics are rarely to be found Combined in one Policeman, but by organising Picked Men into little Bands op Three, great Improvements may be
expected.
Aid to Conversation.—If you are at a loss fur something
to My to a strong-minded woman, tako an opportunity of
asking her why an ironclad alongside of a wooden frigate
reminds one of man and wife? Suppose she replies that
she docs not know, you can tell her—Becauso the wooden
ship is the weaker vessel.
ADDRESS TO THE MOON.
Thy face Is gibbous, Moon. And canst thou shine?
Ah, what if Ethel's cheek should grow like thine I
'The Ray Sot irrv."—The Photographic.
Popular Misstatement.—Christmas comes but onco a
year, say the unthinking. The 26th of December comes
only onco a year, if you like. But the Christmas Panto-
mimes are usually played till nearly Easter, and merry
Christmas very often returns, with a bitter East wind, iu
the midst of merry May.
MONTHLY MEMORANDA.

Me:isures the uiyriapoda with
Man;
Considers how gigantic cranes
are fed.
And carries tho cosmogony to bed.
By Spirit Post.—M Stone walla

satisfy a turnkey's mind by
return.

SEASONABLE ADVICE.
[By a Domestic Economist.)
If your rooms are only large enough to accommodate a
score, when you give a ball be careful to invite at leant a hun-
dred. At the same time only order supper for a score, for people
who are squeesed to death can hardly hare much appetite.
Let your children form a tasting committee of the sweets, ere
thry are placed upon the table. Dirty little finger-marks arc
sure to prove deterrent to the hunger of your guests, and your
family next day will be a g<iner by their abstinence.

In order to s ;em hospitable, walk about the supper-room with
a bottle of Champagne, and challenge friends to drink with you,
telling them, in a stage whisper, that it only cost you eighteen-
pence a bottle.
When you give a dinner-party, hire the smallest glasses that
you can procure, and direct your waiters to put plenty qf ice in
them.
Never encourage arguments before you join the ladies, for
arguing induces thirst, and thirst Is fur from economical.
Hire your waiters upon terms that Hhall induce them to tout
your guests for fees, and thus make them leavj your house
with small wish to revisit it.
If conversation flags, bog somebody or other to oblige you wi
a son^. This will be quite certain to set every one off talking
and prevent their thinking of the bad dinner you have givei
them.
Mkmorablf. Event rv May.—On the 30th of this merr
month the First Napoleon was compelled to raise the siejje o
Acre by tho renowned Sir Sidney Smith. This chivalrous Sjdne:
may be called tho British Cid.
No Fable.— JSsop had a remarkably wide gullet. Ever sinci
his time that part of tho human frame has been called the K- ,
phagus.

for the mere sake of vengeance ; it is sentimental and may
be injudicious. Never defer till to-morrow that which
you can do to-day, but always defer making any payment you
can evade sine die. If you wish to live beyond your Income,
pay your tradesmen by turns. Fay each of them as soon as
he threatenaHo County-Court you, not later, lest he should
be as bad as his word; for then you would have to pay his

STRAWBERRY LEAVES.
A SELECTION FROM THE VERY LATEST LETTERS OF THE HONOURABLE
HORACE WALPOLE, OF STRAWBERRY HILL. FAVOURED BY OUR
PRIVATE SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
To Sir Horace Mann.
Do you remember—pooh, my dear Sir, a diplomatist's business is
to remember everything—besides, this was only t' other day, that is
to say, in the winter of 1739—that I met with a cruel accident on
Mont Cenis? I was travelling with Gray. My poor dear little King
Charles's dog, Tory, the prettiest, fattest, dearest creature in the
world, was snapped up by a wolf, and carried away to be eaten? I
screamed with rage and grief at the time, and have been ready to
do bo ever since when I have thought of it. I hate Mont C6nis. I
have read with savage joy that the engineers and their iron have
entered into his very soul, and made a great hole right through him,
and henceforth and for ever shrieks shall come forth from his pene-
tralia. It is something to be revenged on a great hideous mountain.
You have influence with the sub-Alpine King. Ask him to ordain
that the first railway engine shall be called lory. So shall my lost
darling's manes be appeased.
The distinguished family of Prince Pigwiggin have been plunged
into mourning by a melancholy and unexpected event—he has
recovered, and will probably long survive to afflict them. To offer
them consolation in the circumstances is what I dare not attempt.
I think I told you that there was a philosopher over here some years
ago who held, or at least _preached, that the soul was merely
glue. I suppose that Pigwiggin's, if he have one, is more than
usually sticky.
You have been educated, and you know that there is a place called
Timbuctoo. Well, it is civilised, and there are fashionable squares,
and great folks dwell therein, and give great feasts. They keep
Christmas, it seems, in our own heathenish way, over-eating and
over-drinking. One night last week there was a big dinner in a
fine house. It was given by a notable called the Great Wangdoodle,
whom you are not to confound with the one in Mr. Marks's famous
sermon. You might; for this great Wangdoodle, like the other,
howleth for bis first-born, but then it is by reason that the said first-
born is a silly horse-racing boy, and hath got into the hands of
Messrs. Mordecai, Mephibosheth, Mahershahalhashbash, and Co. But
that is not the matter. The Wang, not being much talked to at his
own table, comforted himself by taking his own wine as freely as if
he did not know how cheap and bad it was. When it was time to
join the ladies, he saw two suns and double Thebes appear. But as
nobody noticed their host, this was not observed until he got up-
stairs. Now, some of the Timbuctoo ladies had been getting up a
bazaar in aid of the conversion of the English, and just as the Great
Wang entered, one of them held up a great large doll, which she
had been dressing for the sale. Wang gazed at it with optics that
reversed the stereoscopic process, and presently shouted forth fu-
riously, "/ hate twins!" and struck in the direction of the double
image he beheld. There would have been confusion, but one of the
Chief Sacrificers (I suppose he would be called a bishop here) who
was one of the guests, sailed in a portly manner forward, like a
worthy member of the Church navigant there at sea, took his lay
friend Wang in tow, moored him in another room, and talked him
to speedy sleep, I presume with a bit of a sermon. I hope Wang
will De grateful. Make no mistake in repeating this story, and be
sure you do not say that Timbuotoo is in Belgravia, and if you are
asked how I heard so quickly from a distant part of the world, say
that the Jersey telegraph has just been completed. That will be
explanation enough for your Italians, who have no geography. This
is not trovato, mind.
We have a new show of old pictures at the Academy. I hear it is
a good one, but I never go to private views, and the public have not
haa it long enough to leave the place decently free. I like to go to
such things when I can be quiet, and escape the instructive remarks
of the Scrubbers and Scumblers.
Would you believe it ?—yes, you should believe everything—the
enemies of the Government were so eag^er to find out a job in the
retirement of Mr. Bright, that they triumphantly accused him of
having remained in office exactly two years in order to qualify him-
self for a pension. Such are our public writers! I do not believe
that their malice prompted a wilful blunder. I believe that as old
Bear Johnson had the courage to say when asked how he came to
give the wrong definition of a horse's pastern, it was " Ignorance,
Madam, sheer ignorance." Yet they might have remembered that
last year Mr. Gladstone carried an Act by which five years of service
is necessary before a pension can be earned.

Notes. I suppose that nobody knows this, at least nobody has had
the good grace to acknowledge the idea for which the Post Office
now obtains so much credit. The halfpenny cards are a good deal
used, but not so much as was expected, I hear. John Bull likes
mystery about a letter, if it be only to tell Mrs. Bull that she must
keep back his mutton for half an hour.
"i our masters, the Ministers, are beginning the game of puss-in-
the-eorner, as usual, before a new Session. I hate snow and frost,
and therefore have not ventured down to the Clubs. I have scarcely
a tea-spoonful of political gossip for you, and you must put a grain
of salt into the little dose I send. On dit—but I don't know who
On is—that the Speaker wants his eoronet, and that Mr. Cardwell
wants the Chair. In that case, England will want a War Minister,
and our friend On asseverates that she is to ihid one in Sir William
Mansfield, the distinguished Indian General. I hope it may be so.
I do not know that he cultivates all the amiabilities so successfully
as the Oxford Druid, but he understands soldiers, and how to make
them useful,—and this is what we need. There are to be some
other changes, and Strawberry Hill itself is interested in one of
them, I believe; but these will keep for another letter. You may
take it from me that they will not convulse the nation with rapture
or terror. ^

NEW YEAR'S NIGHT-THOUGHTS.
Fall, snow flakes, soft and silent, white and cold—
From sunless skies muffled in one grey cloud,
FaU, till the ravaged face of earth you hide
As with a shroud.
That smooth the shroud may lie, and folded fair
Above the horror of the thing below,
Lest unwashed gashes, bones of rent flesh bare
To heaven should show!
Beside the stillness of the white-swathed form
Let us a moment try to put aside
Thought of the blood, the hideous wounds, still warm
And gaping wide—
In vain! Beneath the ooldly mantling white,
A ruddy stain will ooze up through the snow:
Under the smooth sheet ghastly rents of fight,
Perforce, wiU show.
How hide the waste, and wrong, and misery—
Burnt houses, wreoked fields, peasants hunger-bitten
By idle looms, won mothers hushing cry
Of babes plague-smitten?
Such thoughts will come, our Christmas joy to kiU,
Stretch gaunt hands 'twixt us and our Christmas fare,
And to our Christmas song, "Peace and goodwill,"
Strange burden bear!
So dark and dreary dies out the Old Year,
And Hope, half sadly, bids the New Year in;
To sound of Might proclaimed Bight, far and near,
And trumpets' din,
Drowning the song sung by the host of Heaven
To Bethlehem's shepherds, while above shone bright
His birth-star, that now palos, as War's red levin
Kindles the night.
"Tis hard for us to hold our faith in Good,
Might of Forgiveness, majesty of Love,
With Hate's code writ in characters of blood,
Love's law above.
But not the less is Love's commandment clear,
On heart, and conscience graven in letters deep,
That shall, when blood-writ records disappear,
Their brightness keep.
Not less a ruling hand behind the clouds
Of War and Woe guides acts and fates of men:
Till, at The Voice, the "dry bones" in their shrouds
Shall " Live Again."

or the third time, Out.
Odd. What can it mean?
Three calls and three " Not
at Homes," delivered by a
smirking menial whose
head I ionged to punch;
and no return card or
invitation. And yet I was
a great creature among
them last vear; especially
when the Thunderer pat-
ted mc on the back as it
did. They took me up
warmly, and made no end
of a fuss with me; between
ourselves, you know, they
rather overdid it, though
to be sure that book of
mine was a hit, and worth
its reputation! I was their
pet lion for the time, and
none of their parties were
complete without me. And
their other pets showed me
divers attentions. That
Tclvet-tongued Greek, HrPFOPOTAicus Pkeposteros, asked me to
breakfast, gave me tobacco fit for the Padishah, and presented me
to bis haney-tangued friend Bubblijokidos, who rather implied
| that having met me, he had nothing more to live for. Twice was I
invited i» dinner by Sir Aaron Contango, who told me wonderful
| stories atwut the Rothschilds, and offered to invest for me in Monte-
zuma Intangibles. And was I not even bidden to one of Lady
Afterglow's suppers, and shown one of her Ladyship's own poems—
not a thine (for many reasons) to be shown to everybody? And I
| thought I did my roaring pretty well on the whole, and got through all
that was aijpected of me. I wrote in their albums—wretched stuff I
know it was, but no worse than my collaborateurs; it was all wretched
stuff together; I made myself agreeable to their rich snobs, and paid
court to their titled ones; and religiously made believe to accept
their faced gilt for gold; and if I lost certain flakes of self-respect
by the way, I was the poorer, not they. But what I cannot quite
understand is, why they have dropped me. We have had no quar-
rel, and I have not been guilty of any omission of my duties. I am
just the same as I was—in fact, just the same, not having gone
forward or backward in fortune, fame, or position. I wonder if
that is it ?—if my being stationary is the cause of their letting me
drop? Social dynamics are unfathomable; as we all find out in
time.
I think it must be that. People who feed lions like a change of
stock, and think themselves cheated of their rations if their old
beasts have not got new coats by the turn of the year. You have
a fixed amount of pudding for what you have already done; if you
want more, you must do something fresh to get it. Lions are not
like bears, who can suck their own paws, and live on their past
accumulation of fat; lions must be always at it, always practising
new roars, digging out higher tracks, making louder echoes, elBC
they will fand themselves shelved, and left to their den in the desert,
unmolested.
The people who take them up, and put them through their paces,
do so because they are Somebodies in the world of notoriety. They
like doing Maecenas cheaply—how about the Sabine farm?—but
don't thmk for a moment they mean any regard for vou personaUy;
they only like the reflected sparkle of your glory, wliatever it may
be; and if they cannot write your book, or point your pioture, they
can patronise you, which puts them above you, all the same. So
they take you up vehemently; and if you have a weak head, as in
all probability you have, you lose your balanoe, and think it means
you, when it really means themselves and your renown. You find
out your mistake in time; for they wiH drop you when thoy are
tired of you, and have had enough of you, as they are sure to "have
had before long. And they drop you in the handsomest manner.
You have been their Pet Lion for one season, yet the chances are,
when they meet you in the Park, the beginning of next, they do
not see you, and are, most curiously, not at home whenever you
call.
If, however, you do something to set the newspapers on you again,
everything goes into its old grooves, and you are gently reproached
for your long absenoe from their drawing-rooms, and tenderly
reminded of past friendships. If they have just so much human
conscience as would lead them to make the semblance of an apology,
they say how sorry they are that illness, business, anything you like
that never existed, prevented their digging you out; but, naughty
man! you should not have wanted digging out, you should have

come unasked—you know you would have been welcome: with
those three cards of yours in the waste-paper basket, and no notice
taken. If you are particularly feeble-minded, and one of the fluffy-
brained on whom experience makes no lasting mark, you will be

SYMPATHIES OF THE SEASON.
our of hb at this festive' hat
inclement season are wont to
be exhorted to sympathise
with our unfortunate fellow-
creatures. By all means let
us, not only in cold weather,
but in hot, and1 in all weathers
and seasons. But let us at the
same time cultivate—in order
to abate that selfishness which
is too natural to the best of us-
—sympathy with those who
are better off than ourselves.
Let us endeavour to enter into
not only the sorrows of our
kind, but also their joys,
and particularly endeavour to
imagine, so as to be sensible
of, the happiness of those who
abound in wealth. Reflections
such as these must be sug-
gested to the mind of any
moralist of an amiable dis-
position, by the brief but
significant announcement fol-
lowing :—
"Conscience Money. — The
Chancellor of the Exchequer
acknowledges the receipt of £20
for ' Underpaid Income-tax.'"
How happy, if only healthy, must be that man whose means are
so ample that they require his conscience to remit so much as £20
for mere underpayment of Incojne-tax! Of course, that sum is
merely a single arrear. So conscientious a person as he must be
(she is out of the questiou)could never have gone on long under-
paying his1 Income-tax. What may the whole of his Income be
presumed to amount to? A total, doubtless, which would make
many wives and many children happy. His own personal bliss
must be so intense as to be a state of chronic rapture. It is true
that a man capable of sending the Chancellor or the Exchequer
conscience-money for underpaid Income-tax must be endowed with
a very tender conscience, which at times may trouble him. But
there are consolations for that trouble. He does not go about, as
everybody must who is conscientious and dependent, with a con-
science burthened with the fear of not being able to pay his bills, of
being some day obliged to resign comforts and enjoyments, and
perhaps of becoming bankrupt, and dying in the workhouse, after
having lived there some time. We may reasonably rejoice in the
belief that he rejoices in ease of mind, if in ease of body. Anybody
not enjoying the blessed consciousness of a sure and certain pecu-
niary independence might envy him his conscience, however tender
it may be, if envy were not a base and baleful passion, which we
all ought to endeavour to subdue, by trying to contemplate with
satisfaction the opulence of others, and their consequent felicity,
particularly at Christmas time.

Sot,
A CHALK-HEADED CRITIC.
King George the Third uttered a criticism, which com-
mends itself to my mind, when he said that there is a great deal of
rubbish in Shakspeare, only you mustn't say so. Now, for instance,
in Othello, speaking of Cassio, in disparagement, lago says:
"And what wns ho .'
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
That never set a squadron in thi
Nor the division of a battle kno'
More than a spinster."
field,
Is there not, Sir, a gross inconsistency in describing a man, on the
one hand, as " a great arithmetician," and saying, on the other, that
he does not know the "division" of a battle 'i lago further alleges,
concerning Cassio, that
"Mere prattle, without practice,
Is all his soldiership.''
What could have been Shaksotiare'h arithmetical attainments
which allowed him to give a character the reputation of profieieney
in arithmetic, and yet ascribe to it ignorance of Practice i A juve-
nile poet has said: —
** Multiplication is vexation; ,
Division is- a» bad;
The Rule of Three will puzzle me"?
Jind Practice drive me mad."
This poem was probably composed by SHAKsrE vioe at sehooL
Ben Jonsow said-—cud he not, Sir?— that Sbakspeabe "had
small Latin and less Greek." Surely he might have added,. "and
still less ciphering." Phrenologists instance SHAitsPEAJSEfs as an
extremely fine head. It mu plainly not a good chalk one. Had it
been such, he would never had made Jdgo deery arithmetic as a
military qualification. If Cassin possessed that, he must have known
the division of a battle, insomuch as to have been at least fit to be a
General of Division. Pope, I think, said of himself that he " lisped
in numbers." The Nightingale of Twickenham is generally rated
above the Swan of Avon, but the latter could not have had so much
to say for himself as the former in respect of numbers, in the humble
judgment of Tours truly to command, if you want a critic,
Zollus.
P.S.' With reference to arithmetic in connection with military
matters,'it strikes me that the numerical strength of the British
Army is so inconsiderable as not to admit the possibility of Generals
of Division. The fact appears to be that Governments, whose cal-
culating powers were exerted in the direction of mere economy,
have subjected it to a too extensive process of Reduction.
THE LUGUBRIOUS CLOWN.
I thought I had the mind mankind to school,
Among the wise I hoped to shine, a star:
Whereas it is mv lot to play the fool,
And holloa " How d' ye do 'i" and " Here we are!"'
Ay! "How d'ye do?" That is not much to say,
Regarded with a superficial view,
For every fool knows how he does to-day;
But how d' ye do to-morrow f tell me, you.
And " Here we are!" Yes, here, indeed, are we;
But we were not here once. Where were we then?
Where else, when we are not here, shall we be?
Shall we, next year, cry " Here we are again!"
Science Gossip.
The most careful inquiry has failed to detect anything1 in the
habits or conduct of the harmless little creature, so many of us have
admired floating on the water when at sea, which can justify natu-
ralists in calling it the Naughtylus. The name is evidently n
misnomer.
The " Secretary" bird in the Zoological Gardens is taking lessons
in short-hand.
The "Mud-lark " is not a singing bird.
AN ACCIDENT.
During the frost the Thermometer fell three times last week.
Assistance was fortunately at hand on each occasion.

GOOD RESOLUTIONS FOE THE NEW YEAE.
December 31, 1870.— "I stood on the Bridge at midnight," in my Irish
frieze great coat, and made the following good resolutions for 1871.
To read a portion of Gibbon, or Hume, or some other standard
author, every day.
To take regular exercise.
Not to mix my wines when I go out to dinner, and never to touch
dessert.
To keep a diary, and to put down every evening what I have
spent in the course of the day.
Never to give anything again to street-heggars.
Always to have my hath, even in the severest weather.
To go out shopping with my wife whenever she asks me, and to
do so cheerfully and with money in my pocket.
To study some physical science — Astronomy, Paleontology,
Chemistry, &c.
To resume my German.
To try to like classical music.
To pay ready money for everything.
Gradually to leave off smoking.
Not to sit up so late at night; and to get up early in the morning,
light my own fire, and do work before breakfast.
To go to Islington to see my old cousin more frequently, and to
ask her to stay with us for a few days in the Summer.
Not to read so many novels.
Not to wear my best hat every day.
To give no more Christmas-boxes.
To go to the dentist, if that tooth is not better.
To know all about eclipses, ozone, spots on the sun, the tides, &c.
Not to exceed my income.
To read the County History.
Always to travel third-class when alone.
To eat cold meat at dinner without a murmur or a frown.
To read the debates when Parliament meets.
To try to write more legibly.
To be very economical in cabs.
To go frequently to the British Museum and National Gallery.
To learn Bezique, and to play it with my wife every evening when
we are alone.
To encourage the legitimate drama.
To wear goloshes; and
Not to send any more jokes to Punch. [This last is "a detail,"
and it need not trouble our Correspondent. Our Waste-Basket is
large.—P.]
GOOD SCENTS.
A well-known perfumer provides nearly all the West End
Theatres with scented programmes. The same soent everywhere.
He is the real scentsor of plays, as Me. W. B. Donne has probably
said. But- AehHimmel!
MlSTEK RlMMEL,
Couldn't you vary the monotony of your proceedings with an occa-
sional something else? Can't you give us the Adelphi scent, the
Princess's scent, the Globe Bouquet, the—in fact, anything for a
change? Think over it, and let Mr. Punch, when he holds your
newest programme in his delicate hand, not say of it what Hamlet
did of the skull, but on the contrary, bless your ingenuity in the
manufacturing of essences for the benefit of the Nineteenth scentury.
N.B.—Why not dedicate a perfume to the Vaudeville, and call it
The Two Noses f Also the Parfum de Parry might be a graceful
compliment to Mr. Albeby; and, d propos, we trust that the odds
are in favour of his new comedy at the MontaguoJamesandThorne

London at this

and watch the Yule

The entry of the

old) were, we trust,
witnessed by all
from various
points. It is too
late now to guide
the stranger; but

the children to the
Museum in Lin-
coln's-Inn-Fields. If you happen to live near Regent's Park,
take them to the Colosseum, and expatiate upon its past glories.
The entertainment that used to be there can be left to their imagina-
tion; and this will save money.
The Statues in the Squares can be seen for nothing, nrhen there's
no fog.
On Sundays the Gallery of Illustration is a devotional place. The
Rev. T. German Reed (he's no more German than you are French)
preaches, and the organ is played by the Junior Deacon, the Rev.
Cornelius Grain. It is (by permission of the Bishop of London
and the Lord Chamberlain) now used as a Chapel of Ease to St.
James's, where the Christy Missionaries address overflowing congre-
gations during the week days.
On Saturdays, between twelve and three, the stage-door of Drury
Lane is much frequented by the Loungers in London. The Clown
walks out in ordinary everyday costume at this hour. It is not
generally known. He usually lies down in front of the doorway and
allows Mr. Chatterton to tumble over him. No extra charge.
During "the dark evenings there will be a considerable amount
of Rifle practice in the streets by members of the Undetected Force.
The Crystal Palace has a Serious Pantomime, in keeping with the
Religious Solemnities which inaugurated the opening of the Syden-
TO PEBSONS ABOUT TO ASK FOR CHEQUES.
The following letter appears in the Daily News:—
"Bra,—Are your readers aware that on and after the 1st January cheques
payable to order are subject to an ad valorem stamp duty as bills of exchange?
The new Stamp Act, 33 and 84 Vic, cap. 97, so provides.—A Cm
Solicitor."
This letter raises a most important question, and until it is settled
no right-minded person will think of signing a cheque. The " City
Solicitor " may be accurate, or in error, but the point must be cleared
up. It would, be wronging one's Sovereign to defraud the revenue,
it would be wronging one's Family to pay more stamp-duty than the
law requires. A correspondence on the subject must at once he
opened with the Government, and in six weeks, or say two months,
t he state of the law may be ascertained. Until then, of course, no
honest tradesman (and there are several of that class) will venture
to trouble a customer. It may be siifrjrested that the emission of the
words "to order " would elude the arMoulty, but this would 1m an
unworthy subterfmje, to which we axe sure no higii-mindi d English
gentleman and no high-principled tradesman would stoop.
Then1 must be a brief period of suspension of cinques, after which
ordinary commercial relaticais may be

It is a welcome change to read
The authors -of a hoax whose victims were such as those whom the
Observer mildly calls " wiseacres," surely gave no occasion for being
arrested. They committed no offence in victimising rascals by prac-
tising on their rapacious rascality. The British Public ought to be
very much obliged to them for the service they did in the exploit of
biting the biters who got bitten by them through endeavouring to
bite it. As soon as the American authorities discovered that the
advertisements of sham sovereigns were only baits to catch birds of
prey, they probably discharged the advertisers, whose proposed sale
of bad money was in reality merely a " sell" which imposed only
upon fools who were knaves as well, and very great knaves indeed,
although less knaves than fools. But it is cheering to note that
there is honesty enough in the United States to arrest American
citizens for a supposed endeavour to cheat British subjects.
ANGLICAN APPLES.
In a Pastoral Letter addressed to his Clergy, the Bishop of Car-
lisle, Dr. Harvey Goodwin, referring to advisable preparation for
the possible disestablishment of the Church of England, says:—
"I regard it as highly desirable that we should accustom ourselves to a
kind of action which in the case of a disestablished Church becomes an abso-
lute necessity. It is well to practise swimming before the craft becomes a
wreok."
If the most tolerant Church in the world shouldj through the pre-
valence of Nonconformity, come to be disestablished, let us nope
that, having taken the Bishop of Carlisle's hint, and learned to
swim, it will g^et on swimmingly. At present, Establishment keeps
all the clergy in the same boat. But should the craft be wrecked,
how then? When the swimming begins, how will the swimmers
swim together? Too probably after the manner of diverse apples,
capable of human speech. Will not then the Ritualist Pippin be
highly indignant if the Low Russet or the Broad C'odlin should, in

EMINENT MODERN BRITISH DRAMATISTS.
A distinguished contributor to the Atlieiueum} distinguished that
is from the others by signing himself "ft.," is now engaged in
giving from time to time his own views of Modern English Dramatic
Authors. "ft." is evidently well qualified for his task, his freedom
from prejudice being sufficient to satisfy one of the conditions
imposed upon a critio by Dean Swift. As Mr. "ft." has not got on
very far with his work, Mr. P. begs to offer him some assistance,
which will facilitate his progress and enable him to correct whatever
mistakes into which he may up to this time have inadvertently fallen.
Dramatic authors, with these eyes upon them, will now have to
mind their P and their ft, and Mr. P. recommends the critic
of the AtheruBum henceforth in theatrical matters to take his ft
from Mr. P.
We will commence with Mr. Planche. If he is the youngest he is
at all events the most rising author of the present day. His strong
tendency towards the sensational in the few plays of his which have
as yet been produced make us fear for his future. His treatment of
his subject is thoroughly original, and every scene evinces the rough
bold touches of uncontrolled genius. Time will doubtless correct the
faults of youth, and will teach him that one epigram is worth a
hundred real conflagrations and bond fide express trains on the stage.
Tom Taylor.—Another of our rising young dramatists. His
avowed ignorance of modern languages is certainly a drawback to
him in his career, as otherwise he might have already been able to
study the works of the Great Masters of Tragedy and Comedy in
France and Germany. Let us remind him that application will
overcome all such obstacles as neglected education presents. His
pantomimes are replete with humour, a great deal of which, how-
ever, we regret to say, is lost by the injudicious use of large Heads,
through which articulate sounds cannot penetrate. He will be wiser
next Christmas.
John Maddison Morton.—A promising tragic writer. We
regret to see in him a tendency to follow too closely the old classic
Greek models, which are totally unsuited to the time, and, indeed,
are only specimens of dramatic art in its first stage. Ms. Morton's
tragedy Boxandcox has already drawn tears from most playgoers.
We are anxiously awaiting his next effort.
Dionysius Boucicault.—This author belongs to the milk-and-
water school of effeminate drama. Rejecting all situations and sen-
sational effects, he relies entirely upon his dialogue, which is generally
in blank verse, and leaves nothing for the eye to rest on. He will
never take rank among our first dramatists until he quits this^
school-girlish style, and feeds himself and his audience upon far"
stronger meat than he has hitherto done. He shows to best advan-
tage in a very small theatre with little actors; and, indeed, we may
set him down as facile princeps among charade writers and such
mild drawing-room entertainments as may be found by non-play-
goers at the Polytechnic.
R. Reece seldom writes now. His style is too laboured for
the present generation; and his subjects, being invariably taken
from some fearful legend of Fraud, Duplicity, and Vice in its worst
form, would hardly, in these fastidious days, pass the severe scrutiny
of the Chamberlain's Office.
Palgrave Simpson. — If this gentleman could be cured of his
love of mere boisterous fun, and a habit of introducing any wild
scenes that may occur to him, regardless of the advance of the story,
and if he would aim at graceful polish in dialogue, and eschew
exuberance of slang, he might with practice some day achieve
success. He is deficient in the art of construction, but no doubt
this faculty may be ultimately acquired if he will only persevere,
and carefully study his art.
Thomas Robertson.—More perhaps a Historian than a Dramatist,
as his works tend to prove. His style is somewhat pompous and
high-flown, the fault, no doubt, of his early training under the
Kembles. His works can only be seen to advantage on the boards
of Drury Lane or Covent Garden.
Watts Philits.—Chiefly known by his brisk burlesques. His
chief excellence consists in his power of getting rhymes out of most
| unlikely words. His works nave always been of an ephemeral

character, and will never entitle him to the rank of an English
classic.
F. C. Burnand.—This author may perhaps have some claim upon
our memory as a writer of the school of the great German Kotzebue,
whose style he has too servilely followed ever to warrant our
including him among the list of original British Dramatists. His
dramas are seldom under ten acts, are less fitted for the stage than
the closet, and though here and there the student may come upon a
gem of deep poetic thought, yet it is almost entirely lost in the set-
ting. His plays, deeply imbued, or, as Philip Kemble would have
said, Kotzebued, with Teutonic metaphysical subleties, will never
take hold on the English public, until (ahsit omen.') Germany has
invaded, and German thougnt has pervaded our much-loved island
home.
Dr. Westlanb MARaiox.—It is pleasant to turn from the sombre
gloom of Ms.- Rvrnanti's writings to the lively, sprightly pieces, one
third spectacle, one third ballet, one third extravaganza, of Dr. \V.
Marsh**. Ho cannot, perhaps, dance himself, but he is the cause
of dancing in others, and no man can inspire his actors with the
genuine chic of a ean-ean or a breakdown so well as Dr. Westlanb,
Marston. His jingling rhyme is funny without vulgarity v his sub-
jects, generally ohosen from. Fairy lore, axe of a genial character,
and we may set P*, W. MaRSIOJS down as eminently the Dramatist
for Juveniles.
Arthur Sketchley. — Known chiefly by his
Dramas. With tie- decline of Astley's, Mr. Sketchley's occupation
has well-nigh gone. His plays depended upon their being well
mounted, and sows of bis dialogue (in days when dialogue was really
worth listening to) ought to be remembered for its breadth of senti-
ment and its, pointed political allusions. He is a waster of horse I
effects, and was aide himself to instruct his actors in their various
rdhs. There is so«e talk of a theatre being subsidised by Govern-
ment for the especial performance of the Sketchier - Equestrian
Drama'; but ire fear the scheme will fall to the ground.
"Q" of the AthmtFum is perfectly welcome to make what use he
likes of the above information from his friend " Mr. P."
THE HEIGHT OF HUMAN KINDNESS.
Is a circular, issued to solicit contributions for the "Extension
of the New Cut Gospel Hall Work," a Mr. Wright, called by his
familiars " Ned Wright," states that he seeks help in providing
soup suppers for the criminal classes in different parts of London.
"Thieves' suppers," the Times prefixes to a paragraph, which con-
tains the foregoing information. Thieves' suppers! What next?
Thieves' dormitories, perhaps! Thieves' homes to house the poor
thieves for the night, or the day—for those who pursue the line of
burglary.
Soup suppers for thieves! What soup one would like to know?
Possibly real turtle would not be thougnt too good by "Mr. Ned
Wright," if it were not too expensive. As it is, perhaps he would
have them content with mock or ox-tail, and occasionally soup a la
Heine. On one of these cold, wet nights, however, it may be sug-
gested that mulligatawny would be more comforting for the poor
thieves.
The idea of a Thieves' Supper is worthy of a New Cut Gospel. Is
"New Cut" possibly a misprint for "Newgate?" though it oomes
to the same thing. In this new—whether New Cut or Newgate—
Gospel, a prominent place should be assigned to Barabbas. Supper
for Thieves, indeed! The only proper meal is what our forefathers
would have given them—Old English " whipping-cheer."

Unless he is a perfect ass,
Obtuse to all instructors,
For instance, sealing-wax, and glass,
He knows are non-conductors.
He knows that Insulation means
The likeness to an Island,
Whose entire margin water screens,
Encompassing the dry land.
The waves around Great Britain How,
Whence we are situated,
Thank goodness, from the whole world s
As to be insulated. -
But insulation incomplete
Is ours for peaceful traders;
To perfect it we want a fleet,
Which can keep out invaders.
With adjuncts needful for our case
Which, with no vain reliance,
Will, we may trust, supply the place
Of glass and wax in science.
Upon an insulated stool.
Electrified when standing,
A maiden may repel a fool
As we do foes from landing.
Save that our insulating guns
It is that flash and crackle,
And shock the foolish foreign ones,
Who think our tars to tackle.
They jeer at us as insular
In many a thought and notion;
'Tis not unlikely that we are
Blest be surrounding Ocean!
And may we, if, some narrow views
Renouncing as a nation;
Our insularity we lose,
Ne'er lose our insulation.

STREET-SLIDES AND SURGERY.
The late frosty weather (observes a medical correspondent) has
been peculiarly seasonable for practitioners of the healing art, be-
cause it has greatly increased their opportunities for its exercise.
Fortunately for us, the Law can interpose no hindrance between
practice and bronchitis or rheumatism; but in respect of accidents
we are less happily circumstanced, as you will see on reading the
subjoined extract from the Times' Police Report:—
"At Bow Street the greater part of yesterday was occupied in disposing of
cases of drunkenness and assault. There were also many charges against men
and boys for sliding on the pavement to the danger of the passengers. Fines
were imposed in most of these charges."
The imposition of fines for indulgence in the sport of sliding on
the pavement, and thus endangering the limbs and even lives of
passengers, cannot but tend to diminish our interesting and valuable
cases of contusion, dislocation, and fracture, simple and compound.
But we might be in a worse position. If Magistrates, empowered to
visit the amusement abovementioned with fine or imprisonment at
discretion, were, in the exercise of that discretion, to inflict impri-
sonment, they would put a stop to a pastime which they now but
slightly check, and would effect the total discontinuance of a prac-
tice now largely beneficial to our own. On the whole, therefore, wc
have not much cause to complain.

MONEY AND MATRIMONY.
Ere I plunged oft', I did tarry
Long on Wedlock's brink.
IIow I ever dared to marry,
I can hardly think.
Though then marriage brought less pressing
Kills than it brings now
With high living, and high dressing,
Managed Heaven knows how.
Want of money, want of money,
Must be want of mate,
In default of prospects sunny;
Hope of large estate:
Save for Proletarians, wholly
Ruled by price of bread.
None above the lowest lowly,
But the rich, can wed.
Parents of the middle classes
Can't, such wealth demands
Wedlock, and so rare are asses,
Get girls off their hands.
And a man with fear is harried,
Children having got,
Lest his grown sons should get married,
And his daughters not. Fogy.
An Unprofessional View of Things.
We are told that the College of Surgeons have resolved " to dis-
continue mixed classes for the study of medicine." Something
new this—for the Doctors to disapprove of Mixtures.
AN AWFUL PLUNGE.
It is a very courageous thing to go down-stairs at one in the morn-
ing when there are thieves in the house. ■
It is a very courageous thing to walk on a dark road, alone, at
night, in a garotting neighbourhood.
It is a very courageous thing to try to separate husband and wife,
when they are fighting in the street.
It is a very courageous thing to encounter your tailor, when you
owe him a heavy bill.
It is a very courageous thing to meet a lady for the first time after
she has jilted you.
It is a very courageous thing to tell a mother that her baby is
ugly. •
It is a very courageous thing to oppose the wishes of your wife and
your wife's mother.
It is a very courageous thing to face a mad bull.
But, perhaps, the most courageous thing of all is, to bathe in the

FOREIGN COMPLIMENTS OF THE
SEASON.
Yah, you people of mean traders!
Unprepared to meet invaders,
Who as fat prize oxen view you
Think of strife to keep clear, do you?
Will you let no insult poke you
Up to fight? Will nought provoke you?
Out of war to keep you ve gone in,
But you '11 certainly be drawn in.
There's a Treaty broken, look you,
Into trouble won't that hook you f
No! you dodge one more occasion
Of a quarrel, with evasion.
Ha, but now vour flag is trampled!
Patience will be unexampled.
Do you wait for explanation?
Faugh, base, cautious, crawling nation!
Lo, your Army is neglected,
And your Coast is ill protected!
On your Navy what reliance,
In these days of steam and science?
Knowing that, do you determine
Not to strike, you sneaking vermin,
Till you 're armed, by land and water,
With o'er-whelming means of slaughter?
Odious, peaceful, prosperous cattle,
Foes upon you may force battle.
Russians, backed by Yankees, kick you,
May they make you fight—and lick you!
Be your paltry alms confounded!
They but help our sick and wounded.
As allies we need your purses—
Give us money—take our curses!
More Wonderful Still.
Tables "turn," and " creak," and " groan," and are
"set in a roar;" but doors beat them—they can speak—

STRAWBERRY LEAVES.
A SELECTION PROM THE VERY LATEST LETTERS OF THE HONOURABLE
HORACE WALP0LE, OF STRAWBERRY HILL. FAVOURED BY OUR
PRIVATE SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
To Sir Horace Mann.
You wish me a happy new year, my dear Sir. Wish me rather, a
happy new self. Without that, new years can bring me little but
new vexations. But I thank you heartily; and as you have learned
to be happy with a very little^I hope the year may bring you the"
Red Ribbon of your heart. Without unduly raising your hopes, I
may say that a certain doctor has been called in in a certain quarter,
and his patients are not given to trouble their friends long.
There is much scarlet fever around us, and I sent twenty guineas
to our clergy, who have been manful among the poor. You do not
think I tell you this to magnify my charity, for I know that you
will not tell of it again. But I must mention it, because you must
hear the charming passage from Shakspeare with which I sent the
money. I wrote to the Vicar in the words of Don Armado. Under-
standing that the Curate and yourself are good at such eruptions, &c.
Praise me, or for ever hereafter hold your peace, as, indeed, you are
too apt to do without invitation.
Do not ask me any more about Paris. I am sick of the subject,
and the Parisians have just done a thing which makes me hate them.
What do you say to their having sold the three poor elephants at
the Jardin to a butcher, to be slain for food! The poor, dear, affec-
tionate, kindly creatures—how could any one have the heart to
murder them f Also, to feed perhaps a gang of the swaggering,
cowardly National Guards whom Trochu can by no manner of
means persuade to stand fire. The elephants themselves, with towers
tilled with riflemen, would be a hundred times more useful in attack
than the gluttons who are to devour them. I only hope that they
will be put to death easily. Imagine their being dragged from
India and Africa to live in cages, and amuse a mob for years, and
then to be killed, and eaten by the mob! I hope they will disagree
with the cannibals. As for the Paris folk, they will soon be in the
condition of the King of Siam, as described to Mr. Samuel Pepys,
one of my predecessors in the representation of Castle Rising "Our
king do not live by meat nor drink, but by having great lyes told
him." But I suppose things are coming to an end. As for the new
Emperor of Germany, he must, he shall, spill much more blood to
make his Title good. Royal heraldry rejoices in gules.
The Airgonauts have not been sailing much from Paris of late.
The skilled air-sailors have all departed, so sea-sailors are being
pressed into the service. When I told you that Louis Philippe's
father had been ascending in a balloon, I little thought that the
machine would ever play such a part in war. It will date, in his-
tory, from the great siege. 'Twas a French invention, and they
have a right to its benefits.
Your young King Amadeus has been duly welcomed by his
Spanish subjects, whom he has addressed in I know not what lan-
guage. I do not love Kings, but I can admire courage even in them,
and he has shown himself worthy of the blood of Savoy. The
murder of Prim was a dastardly deed, and whether done by priests
or republicans, has recoiled on its authors, for the nation rallies to
the young Sovereign. The assassins escaped so easily that one would
think Iberia was Hibernia.
Any one introduced by you has but to think I can serve him, to
command me. I have shewed all attention to Mr. V. But I may
say to you that I fail to discover in him the wit you credit him with.
All he managed in that way was a set of well-worn iokes of a
Biblical sort. Perhaps I am not one to preach against that kind of
humour, but there is a difference between a sly, quiet allusion sent
to a friend, and a loud-mouthed irreverence in all companies.
When I know him well enough, or when I am enongh tired of him
not to mind offending him, I shall tell him that a witty man despises
such things for their easiness, and a good man detests them for their

profanity. That will stop his vulgarisms or his visits. I know you
do not care much about him, my dear Sir, or I should not say this.
As for the other man you mention, he has ceased to trouble me. He
wrote against the church and standing armies until he had made money
enough to buy a living for one son, and a commission for the other,
and he has retired into the country, I suppose to write a sequel to
The Hypocrite. I hope ho has a good looking-glass, for the best art
studies closest from Mature.
My tipsy gardener, Ralph, whom I do not like to keep or to dis-
charge, nearly relieved me from the dilemma last week, but he
having never, for his life, been able to do anything thoroughly,
matters are as they were. He, Bacchiplentts, went head foremost
into the gold-fish pond. I ought to have letlhim remain there, but
fearing for the nerves of my poor little fishes, I ran out bareheaded,
and in the rain, and hooked him out with his own rake. Since, he
has been more tipsy than ever, on the plea of keeping out the cold.
I have never been more struck with the merit of the illustration
which a husband, asked by his wife what was the difference between
an accident and a misfortune, gave the inquiring virago. "Why,
my love, if you fell into a river, that would be an accident." Yes,
well'r"' "And, my soul, if you got out again, that would be a mis-
fortune."
You will see the Ministerial changes in the Gazette. Strawberry
Hill is the Board of Trade, and I should not wonder if we acquit
ourselves well. Whenever there is a frightful muddle and ruin any-
where, it is always caused by the "men of business," as they loftily
call themselves. I think the men of pleasure should nave an
innings. I told you of the Indian General, who ought to have had
War. It seems that they did want him, and do, but—not yet. So
the existing War-God inaugurates his new reign by two blunders.
Firstly, he actually defends himself against a charge of having
stated a falsehood, of which the Druid is as incapable as you or L,
and no one should quote of him :—
"In yonder cave a Druid lies."
Secondly, he writes to his Chief hereon, because it is mentioned
in a wretched petition—I suppose, from some of the discharged white-
bait waiters at Greenwich—asking the Premier to retire from the
representation of tea and shrimps. Fancy a War-Secretary noticing
such insolence. Fancy old Pam's War-Secretary doing it—and
living. Lord Harrington goes to Ireland, and yet the able young
old \Vhig is not to be pitied, for he will live in intimacy with tin
Viceroy and Vicereine. Mr. Monsell takes the Post Bag, which
reminds me that mine yawns for this letter.
Ever Yours,
HORACE WALPOLE.
public offices from the operation of the Order in Council, which had
seemed to emancipate the Civil Service from patronage and jobbery,
and to introduce Free Trade in Government Appointments; until at
last fathers and mothers began to fear that if Harold and Arthur
were to take office under the Crown, their entrance into public life
must be accomplished either through the Excise or the Police. _
It is our painful duty to-day to give publicity to a notice in the
London Gazette which, wo fear, will not tend to allay these serious
misgivings. Another Department has found shelter in Schedule B.,
another office is exempted from the unrestricted competition of
healthy, woll-conducted, and well-crammed youth—one, too, on
which the hopes of all, particularly in North Britain, must, from
the very outset, have been pre-eminently fixed.
As suspense may be becoming painful, it is kinder at once to make
known tin fart that "The Keeper of the General Register of Sasines,
and of the Register of Homings, Inhibitions, &c. for Scotland, with
the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's
Treasury, hereby adds all situations in the Deportments of the
General Register of Sasines, and of the Register of Homings, Inhi-
bitions, &c. for Scotland, to the Schedule marked 1!., annexed to
Hi r Majesty's Order in Council of the 4th of June, 1870."
To comment on this heartless announcement—the death-blow to
so many high aspirations—would only serve to harrow the feelings
unnecessarily. Regrets are unavailing, remonstrances would pro-
bably be equally ineffectual. The Civil Service can no longer be
looked upon as the honourable and extensive field for youthful
industry, energy, and ability (commencing at seventy pounds per
annum, and rising by an annual increment of fifteen pounds, to
three hundred and fifty), whiuh ft was i'ondlv hoped ft might become.
But we have one spark of hope left. Parliament meets in a few
weeks. We are strangely mistaken if we have heard the last of
"The Keeper of the Register of Sasines, Homings, Inhibitions, &c."

No more nominations! No more importunities to the Borough

of the more daring felt, was sure to come in time) saw in their sons

THE CHIGNON AT CAMBRIDGE.
At the examination lately held at Cambridge, a number of students
from the Ladies' College at Hitehin passed their " Little-go;" the
first time that such undergraduates ever underwent that ordeal. It
is gratifying to be enabled to add, that out of all those flowers of
loveliness, not one was plucked. Bachelors of Arts are likely to be
made look to their laurels by these Spinsters, and Masters must
work hard or they wiU be eclipsed by Mistresses, more completely
than the Sun was the other day by the Moon. And we may expect
that when such competitors of both sexes come to perform ui>on the
classical and mathematical Tripos, a Pythoness will be first upon
the former, and another young lady will dance off triumphantly

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MISTAKEN HUMANITY.
Deputation of Svmpa-
tliisers with the Canine
Species yesterday waited
on Mr. Punch (who
represented Mh. Glad-
stone), to complain of the
remissness exhibited by
Government in not using
their influence to prevent
the continued fighting of
dogs in the street.
Mr. Punch said he
could assure them that
the Ministry of which he
was the Monitor had done
everything in their power
to prevent dogs from fol-
lowing their quarrelsome
inclinations. They had
called to them in the most
persuasive tones to lie
down and be quiet: but
the animals would fly at
each other's throats, and
they could not prevent
to part them by holloa-
purpose. The attempt to
attended with more than
them. Afterwards they
ing with all their might, but to
separate them by main force would be
danger—to which no humane Government would subject people.
Tlm-c employed in making it would certainly get their hands severely
bitten, the consequence of which might be hydrophobia, and, ulti-
mately, a gieat peeimuu'y W* tu i.kc nation. Nobody could he mom
distressed than he (Xr. Punch) was at the spectacle presented by
the canine eombatants. They tore one another's ears in a way fear-
ful to contemplate, and inflicted the most horrible laceration* on
each other. His heart bled to behold such sights. But the atroci-
ties which they mutually perpetrated probably hurt those who re-
ciprocated them less than the lookers-on. A thoughtful poet had
finely said:—

! Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
For 'tis their nature to,"
and the poetry of those two lines he believed was no fiction. There
was every reason to believe that the dogs loved fighting, as they
went to fight with their eyes open, and would fight in spite of the
most earnest dissuasion. By-standers would act unjustly in taking
part with the weaker dog. That dog had attacked the other first.
At present, even if inclined, wo had not power to choke off the
stronger dog. By trying to do so we should most likely bring bears
down upon us, and also wake snakes. He (Mr. Punch) would not
trouble his beloved hearers with a long sermon, but would conclude,
instead of beginning, his discourse with a text, which all present
who had acquired the "Three R's" had learned in cultivating the
Second R., and he would recommend them to study it with reference
to the fighting dogs in whose unhappy strife they took a kind but
injudicious interest. His (Mr. Punch's) text was, "Mind your own
business."
The Deputation, having thanked Mr. Punch for the instruction
which he had given them in answering their application, withdrew.
COCK AND HEN ROBINS.
Iy many a country-house, during the late inclement weather,
occasionally, at breakfast time, a pleasing sight has been presented
by a cock-robin hopping up to the window, and a pretty little girl
(or great one) feeding it with crumbs. The' thought of it suggests
the query, why is the red-breast always spoken of as cock-robin?
Are there no hen red-breasts? would be a fool's question, but the
fellow is uncommonly wise in ornithology who knows a cock red-
breast from a hen. The hen red-breast is so like the cock as to be
almost indistinguishable from him in appearance. To minds of a
figurative tendency, the masculine semblance of the female red-
breast may seem to render her an apt emblem of the Strong-Minded
Woman.
A Prussian Joke.
Tmt motto of the Hohenzollehns is Suum Cuique. It befits
their history, and would be as suitable to their hatchments as
Resurgam. No less appropriate would it be as an epitaph on a
headstone over Bob Hoy's grave. How much less becoming a
scrupulous Royal Family would be Alienum Nobis.'

A MUCH-ABUSED MAN.
Their ex-monarch and idol the French who defame,
Still allow him one very respectable name;
For a Man, at least, Louis Napoleon they own,
Man of Strasburg, tor instance, and Man of Boulogne.
By his bitterest foes he's described as a Man,
As the Man of December, and Man of Sedan.
For misfortune, perhaps, more than fault they've maligned him.
As the song says, we Speak of a man as wc find him.

The resolute ladies who, sticking at nothing, desire to be allowed
to study Surgery, Anatomy, &c, in our public hospitals, are talking
with triumph of Giorgione s picture in the Royal Academy Exhibi-
tion of the Works of the Old Masters—'' A Lady Professor of Bologna"
—and anticipating that glorious time when some one of the clever
Scotch portrait painters will exhibit "A Lady Professor of Edin-
burgh."

prceterea nil.
Not that prceterea nil is
strictly true, for the ta-
lented Vokeses don't paint

Which very cleverly,

but we dare say they could

can sing, dance, and act,

heroine in serious drama

very serious drama) as well
as she can a burlesque part

his Holiness foreseeing the King of Italy buriecL for
sacrilege, beneath an Alp, like the Titan under Etna.
If so, let us hope that, as a Prophet, at least, the Holy
Father is not infallible.
New Proverb.—Set an Ass to find a Mare's Nest.
IMPROVED PENNY-A-LINING.
Among the many valuable lessons to be taught us by the present
War, may be noticed a style of narrative which ordinary reporters
may learn from Special Correspondents. Even these eye-witnesses
of the realities of War occasionally, indeed, present us with un-
adorned accounts of them, as harrowing as we can imagine any
details which could have been revealed by the Ghost in Hamlet, if
he had not been forbidden to tell the secrets of the prison-house.
But by far the greater part of their letters from the seat of war are
written in that lively and cheerful manner which, in modern Eng-
lish, is distinguished by the epithet "rollicking. Now, would it
not be a great improvement on the usual language in which the
British Public is wont to be supplied with information concerning
common murders and executions, if the "rollicking" style were
generally adopted by the gentlemen of the Press who chronicle those
events? No oivil murder, whether in respect of the number of
victims, or the spectacle presented by their remains, however seri-
ously considered, is comparable for horrors to the carnage of a battle-
field ; and no execution, not even that of 1 >amikns, can be regarded
as a scene of torture more complicated and atrocious than that pre-
sented by the wounded, on the plain, or in a military hospital. Yet
a single murder, or infliction of capital punishment, described in
customary terms, is much duller and more dismal reading than the
most sanguinary battle, recounted in Special Correspondents' special
way. Surely reporters would very much enliven our breakfast
tables by similar treatment of common homicide and hanging.
The scenery surrounding the spot at which a murder had been
committed, the costume; manners, and customs of the people there-
abouts, and other like circumstances, would aflard plenty of subjects
for minute and lively word-painting. The journey to the prison
wherein a murderer was to be hanged, would probably be attended
with numerous incidents which* could be put in a jocose light. A
break-down of a cab, the quality and price of a cigar smoked on the
way, and many other matters'equally relevant, could be worked up
likewise; and the whole relation, ten times its present average
length, could conclude with the agreeable embellishment of a chat
with Calcraft.
The advantage derived from''' rollicking " reports of assassinations
and executions would be that of inducing a very large, if not the
largest, class of readers to regard murder and the gallows with a
feeling no more painful than the levity with which they think of
artillery and rifles, and the work wrought by means of those instru-
ments of glory.
SALLY BY A SCOT.
At a recent meeting of the Edinburgh Free Church Presbytery, a
resolution "emphatically and solemnly" protesting "against the
doctrine or opinion that tne rulers of this Protestant country may, or
ought to, charge themselves with taking any concern about the
dignity, freedom, or independence of the Pope—even on the ground
of there being so many in the country willing to own his spiritual
supremacy," was carried, on the motion of Dr. Candlish. Hech.
mon, our Candlish, a'm thunkin, is a burnin' an' a shinin' light o

Piety Before Paris.
It is a wonder that the pious King of Prussia has not long ago
allowed Paris to be re-victualled. So Christian a Sovereign, one
imagines, would naturally think that giving his enemies food and
drink would be a method of heaping coals of fire on their heads more
effectual than that of a bombardment.

FROM H. Jf. KING PHCEBUS TO
. PUNCH.
Dear Punch,
I am the most persecuted monarch. I don't complain of
the Earth's revolutions. They don't affect me. But of allpersons
placed by Providence in an exalted situation, I, Sir, have to submit
to the greatest annoyances. Talk of Lord Lorne being mobbed by
photographers! why, his case is a joke to mine. Morning, noon,
and night, in the four quarters of the globe, persons calling them-
selves ladies—aye, Sir, ladies—and gentlemen, are perpetually
watching my movements with a curiosity which is as vulgar and ill-
bred as it is impertinent and intrusive.
My Heavens! is this the nineteenth century? It is, alas! it is.
And—I regret to have to say it—the more advanced the civilisation,
the more prying and persistent is their curiosity.
I cannot even get my own day, Sunday, once a-week to myself.
Ah, Sir, would that we could return to the ancient times of Rome
and Greece, when I really teas a Sovereign, and more, a Divinity!
but this age of Progress and republican sentiments has reduced mo
to a mere second-rate power; and, my chariot and horses having
long 'since been put down, I may as weU give up my corona, too,
and abdicate entirely, patiently awaiting the results of a reaction in
mv favour.
thousands of people—snobs all—are daily out on hill tops, moun-
tain tops, and house tops, to see me rise in the morning. They
remark on my'colour ; if I am pale and weak, there is no commisera-
tion for me. They (ladies, Sir, as I have already emphatically ob-
served) wateh me taking my vapour bath, and ingenuously notice
that I am "watery." If I am red, they call me angry; and so I
am, but I am blushing at the indignity to which I am being sub-
jected. As to the occasional spots on my face—they 're constitu-
tional, and not the consequence of intemperate habits. I arranged
with my dear Diana the other day (chaste Queen! she is utterly
shocked, at such conduct) for what you on earth call an eclipse. I
was determined to retire and take a holiday, and Di promised to
represent me for the day. The news got about; out came photo-
graphers, out came ships full of " scientific men," sight-seers and
cargoes of the profattum riilgus, qttos ego—as my poor old Nep once
sung out, and then 'stopped short—all determined to see what I
intended to do, and where I was going to.
But this time they were disappointed. I had fortunately tipped
the Clerk of the Weather, ana ne so "fogged" the enterprising
snobs that they were unable to get anything more than a glimpse of
one of my candles which were lighted when I was about to make
myself comfortable for the evening. Diana was a trump on that
occasion. And having registered my complaint, and kicked up this
little shine, mon cher Punchui,—I remain,

GENEROSITY TO IRELAND.
The dis-establishment of the Irish Church having now been con-
summated, certain vacancies in the House of Lords result from the
retirement of Irish Bishops. A Correspondent calling himself
"Conciliation" suggests that they afford, a splendid opportunity
to Her Majesty's Government of doing more than justice to Ireland,
which is less than Ireland wants. He considers that the vacant
Peerages enable Mb. Gladstone, if willing, to treat Ireland with
generosity. Let the Premier, he Bays, fill the seats in the Upper
House, which the Irish Bishops have vacated, with Fenian jour-
nalists, and that they may feel the honour thus conferred upon them
truly worth their acceptance, let him ,be sure to attach a sufficient
pension to their several titles.
PARALLEL PASSAGES.
"The inundation [at Kome] will, doubtless, be considered by many
Italians as of ill omen. A lady, the wife of a Captain in the Pope's late
army, said to me, yesterday, that she firmly considered it a judgment of
Heaven on the people of Kome."—Roman Correspondent, Times of
Janukry 6.
"During the thunderstorm on the morning of the 26th, a thunderbolt fell
on the Vatican, near the apartment of Monhionoh Miniatelli; another fell
in the Villa Ludovisi."—Koman Correspondent, Echo of January 5.
Two sides can play at this game of "Judgments." Why should
not " the people of Rome " consider the thunderbolt on the Vatican
a " Judgment" on the Pope of Rome?
Football.
During the present winter schooltime the game of Football has
attracted considerable attention. A Medical Man has asserted that,
in a short space of time, several hundred accidents to arms, heads,
and legs havo resulted from this game. His statistics have been
contradicted, and a Calculating Boy has shown that, given a certain
number of games in a certain time, the accidents can be reduced, in
the instance of each game, to a mere fraction. Satisfactory.

A REAL CASE OF DISTRESS.
PITT THE POOR FOGGED-OCT PHOTOGRAPHERS!
A WATCHDOG'S BARK.
Mb. Speaker,
How enviable is your position, considered with a view to the treat
which you will shortly begin enjoying for some six months! Night after night
you will have the pleasure of sitting up, often till three o'clock in the morning.
So, indeed, will many people in high life, out of Parliament; but theirs will
be the frivolous and petty pleasure of dancing, and small talk. You, on the
contrary, will sit still, and hear talk of the very largest kind, and the longest.
Ten or a dozen orators in succession will talk pamphlets to you; a pamphlet
each almost every night. Every sentence in succession will be an epigram
embodying wisdom and conveying information—if you need that. The language
addressed to you will be so lucid that there will seldom be any necessity for your
entertainer to repeat a statement, much less to say the same thing over and over
again in different words.
The eloquence of the gentlemen whose hearer you will be—called, therefore,
as though from not speaking. Speaker—will be exerted chiefly on the inter-
esting subject of our Jsational Defences. This will be treated in the most ex-
haustive manner possible, only not so as by prolixity to exhaust your patienoe.
The immense importance of reorganising the British Army, indicated by the
collapse of the French, will be fully explained, but not more fully than pithily.
In the meanwhile, of course, military reorganisation will proceed at such a rate,
that wise oratory will be accompanied by suitable action. And, Sir, in discuss-
ing the lessons to be derived from the Franco-German "Warj the gentlemen
over whose discourse you will preside will, doubtless, not limit their rhetoric
to the more obvious, but, though very important, perhaps less important one.
Their utterances will not merely be delivered in view of the particular collapse
whose likelihood is directly suggested by that of the French Army. They will,
some of them at least, have a word or two to say tending to obviate the still
worse collapse, of which the possibility should be suggested to us, by that
national misfortune of our neighbours—I mean the collapse which, for us, Sir, in
our position, would be the one most truly analogous to that which they have
sustained—the not impossible collapse of the British Navy,
be gratified by the big bow-wows. _ Among them,
warning bark which you have heard from your ever fait!
You will presently
will be echoed the

SONGS OF SIXPENCE.
THE MUSICAL FAMILY.
I belong to a musical lot,
1 've sisters, and brothers, and cousins,
I've grandpas and grandmammas got,
And uncles, like oysters, in dozens.
We all of us instruments play,
We practise night, morning and noou;
My father at six every day,
Gets up to awake the bassoon.
My grandmother, uinety about,
A widow was left all alone,
'Cos grandfather blew himself out,
One night on the gentle trombone.
My Uncle Sam plays on the harp,
In a wild and inspirited manner;
And my Aunt plays three tunes in F sharp,
On a strong-minded Broadwood pianner.
Mv Uncle Bill sits on a stool.
For his size he's uncommonly tliin;
In the summer he keeps himself cool,
With airs on his own violin.
My younfj brother Tom, quite a boy,
Has written an op'ra called Tassu;
To sit up in bed is his joy,
And play his own tunes on the basso.
My Great Aunt's composed (she's a " Sim' ),
Oratorios—one is called Xue,
And on Sundays she plays us a hymn
Arranged for the cheerful oboe.
My sister 's attached to the flute,
And brings out most wonderful tones;
My nephew—a vulgar young brute—
Prefers nigger airs on the bones.
Mv youngest who says " rfat" for " </tat,"
In fact he's of Ave the last comer,
Performs with two spoons on my hat,
And cries out, "Papa! I'm a dummer."
My baby in arms has a way
Of playing the fife on its coral;
And my twins play the bag-pipes all day,
With a loyalty worthy Balmoral.
Through life we've in harmony passed
With a stock of some twenty or more tunes,
And a sum we've together amassed,
Which is equal to two or three fortunes.
Wherever our musical tribe
Took a house 'twas our aim, I admit it—
To make all the neighbours subscribe
A sum to induce us to quit it.
So all the great cities we've seen,
From the Thames to the banks of the Tiber;
And every one in 'em has been,
A heartily willing subscriber.
As thus Europe we ve done, the word's sharp
To Jericho f thither we 'U hie,
To learn the neglected Jews' harp
From native Professors. Good-bye!
Most Important.—Eminently gratifying! No more alarm! No more
anxiety! Why t Because in a recent telegram addressed to the world at
large, Greece says, "Our Foreign Policy will be Peaceful!" Hooray!
The Greatest of all Functionaries.
Happy, thrice happy Rome! Not because of the down-
fall of the Pope, not because of the visit of the King of
Italy, but because it—the "Eternal City," the City of the
Cesars—has a " Lord Mayor!" We hope this is only
the commenoement of a better order of things, and that
before long we shall hear that Imperial Rome has also
Common Councilmen, and City Companies, and Vestries,
and Wardmotes, and a Toastmaster, and a large consign-
ment of Turtle, and aU the other luxuries London has so
long enjoyed.

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
Wheke shall we go?
Happy Thought. The Grecian, to see Conquest's Pantomime.
We arranged for an early dinner; we uttered touching farewells
to our friends in the West, promising to write soon, or to telegraph
during the journey down East, and then tearing ourselves away
from all that was dear to us—and everything in the West is very
dear to us—we wrapped ourselves up, and committed ourselves to
the experienced driving of Number Two Thousand and Something,
who, in twenty-five minutes from the time of our starting from
Covent Garden, set us down at the door of the Grecian. Only
twenty-five minutes, and we didn't change horses once .'
We were received at the GoUery door by an enormous crowd
making an almost deafening noise. A courteous gentleman, unoffi.-
cioUy employing himself in opening cab doors, informed us that we
should find that an easier entrance could be effected a few steps
further down. Bestowing largesse upon this useful and ornamental
individual, we followed his instructions, and presented ourselves at
the bar of the Grecian, where we were confided by the most obliging
and attentive Proprietor himself to the care of a servant of the
establishment, who preceded us aoross a sort of Old V mix hall Gar-
dens in little to the entrance of the Theatre.
And now to business.

The place is crowded. The appearance presented by Drury Lane

house. The hubbub arising from the entire mass may be perhaps
faintly described as what might be imagined to be the sound of
Noises boiling. Niagara and Vesuvius, with the "machinery in
motion" from the Polytechnic {by way of trying another descrip-
tive simile) have come out to see Mb. CoNQtJEST's Pantomime on
Saturday night. This quotation from the Playbill will give some
idea of the Thousands able to gain admittance:—" Persons wish-

Overture to the Pantomime of" Heme the Hunter."
Overture almost inaudible; what ice did catch occasionally we
thought very good indeed, though as this was only the drum part
it would be scarcely fair to found any critical opinion upon the
whole as a work of art. Roars of delight at the end of the
Overture from all parts of the house, which could only be aware
of its cessation by seeing the musicians stop playing. Lights
down. Increasing excitement. Interval of awful suspense.
Expressed delight of a Small Boy in the corner of the side gallery
at seeing a Fairy standing between the proscenium andthccurtain.

More awful suspense. A sort of operatic prompter's box suddenly
appears on the stage in front of the conductor o f the orchestra.

Noise slightly, very slightly, subsides. Bell. Music (we believe), to
which curtain rises, discovering somebody, a fairy (we imagine)
behind a cauldron. All is mystery and sulphuric smell. Fairy
speaks, that is, we see her lips moving. Man in operatic promp-
ter's box turns on a set of magic lantern slides illustrating, we
fancy, the four seasons, and finally slwwing a picture of Herne
the Hunter. All this is received with loud applause, ami <t
good deal of coughing in consequence of the smell above men-

A ROYAL EXAMPLE.
N Mr. Punch's opinion the
following bit of news de-
serves the widest circula-
tion, and he is therefore
tempted to admit it to his
all-pervading columns:—
"Valuable presents of Game
have been forwarded by Her
Majesty the Queen and His
Royal Highness the Prince
up Wales, for the patients in
the London hospitals."
What great folks do, the
less will prattle of : and t la-
more such Royal doings as
those above recorded are
talked about the better,
because people may thereby
be led perchance to copy
them. Britons are ever
prone to imitate their bet-
ters; and it mav be hoped
that many a noble sports-
man, when he hears of what
the Queen and the Prince
of Wales have done, may
conceive the happy thought
of doing something like it.
Mr. Punch has a horror
and a hatred of battues; but if anything could justify the slaughter-
ing at "hot corners" of whole hecatombs of pheasants, it would be
the plea that they were wanted for poor patients in a hospital.
Mr. Punch would gladly chronicle the fact that my Lord Blazeawa y
had been lately entertaining a distinguished set of swells, and had
sent the game they slaughtered to the nearest parish doctor, for the
use of the poor people who were then on his sick list. Few things are
more stupid and more snobbish than the paragraphs one sees relat-
ing how my Lord Tom Noddy has been Bhooting through his coverts,
in company with Sir Toby Crackshot, General Bangup, Captain
Rocketer, and Mb. Neverkibs, and, with the assistance of an army
of beaters, has bagged eleven hundred and thirty-seven pheasants,
ninety-nine partridges, six hundred and three hares, two thousand
and ten rabbits, twelve woodcocks, and one snipe. Some interest
would however attach to such a record, were a postscript to be added,
merely stating that, in humble imitation of Her Majesty and His
Royal Highness, his Lordship had presented to the County Infirmary,
and the Royal Free Hospital, all, except the snipe and woodcocks,
of the game his friends had bagged.

A Remembrance.
Artemus Ward, when contributing to these columns, observed
(it was on the 1st of September, 18G(i), "I sav to that gifted but
bald-headed Prushan, Bismarck, 'Be good and gentle in your hour
of triump.'" The hint of the kindly humorist haB been forgotten
by the stern Chancellor.
Music.—Falsetto singing is not punishable with penal servitude.
But it is very much like uttering forged notes.

THE PHILOSOPHER'S BRIDE.
articctarly wanted, by a
Gentleman bordering on
middle age, and moderately
well off, a WIFE. She must
be a few years younger
than himself, healthy, and
well-proportioned. Beauty
of face not absolutely ob-
jected to; but preference
would be given to a plain
girl, that is to say, not an
ugly but a commonly good-
looking one, whose face will
not soon spoil. No money
expected with her; but
the more she has the better.
Must be sufficiently well
educated to read and under-
stand Punch. Need not
personally play or sing, or
be endowed with any pic-
torial skill, but must be
capable of enjoying Art,
and have Music in her soul.
Her reasoning faculties,
at the same time must be
sufficiently well developed
to enable her to draw a
correct inference. It is
necessary that she should be well versed in cookery, needlework,
and all the ordinary provinces of feminine usefulness.
She is required to be further characterised by the following peculia-
rities. Natural repugnance to earrings and chignons. Loathing and
abhorrence of rouge and skin-powder. Love of finery and good living,
no matter how ardent, if of the latter rather than the former, accom-
panied by content to let both be limited by pecuniary circumstances.
Solicitude about dress and decoration with a view to pleasing her
husband; perfect unconcern as to pleasing anybody else. Utter con-
tempt for the ridicule of acquaintance, incurred by necessary
economies. Unfeigned dislike to balls and evening parties. Pre-
ference of a box at the Opera to an amphitheatre stall, if it can be
well afforded; otherwise, of the amphitheatre stall to the box.
Disposition to cultivate all the elegancies of life, always in sub-
ordination to comfort, and when retrenchment is necessary, choice
to retrench first of all in show. Any amount of passion for furniture,
so long as the dinner-table is carea less for than the dinner, and the
dinner is not extravagant. The utmost fondness of trips, travelling,
staying at the sea-side, theatres, concerts, and every sort and kind
of real pleasure and amusement, provided always that self-denial of
enjoyment imposed by ciroumstances, can be borne without repining,
or melancholy. Finally, she must nave no relations. Any young
lady whose abilities, inclinations, and conditions, coincide with the
foregoing, will find in the advertiser a most affectionate and indul-
gent husband, who will let her do whatever, she pleases.

MODERN MEN OF LETTERS.
Mb. Hain Friswell has written a book. Not his first work, as
he has previously written The " Gentle Life" which we, not being
disciples of old Isaac Walton, did not read. We dare say that to
those interested in bottom-fishing The Gentle Life was an invalu-
able guide. Mr. Hain Friswell's present book is entitled
Modern Men of Letter* Honestly Criticised. Its great point is, of
course, its honesty, and so, giving every possible credit to Me. Hain
Friswell for the best intentions, we beg to offer him a few hints,
for which doubtless he will be sinoerely grateful as they will enable
him to correct occasional mistakes in such important details as he
has introduced concerning the height, manners, and dress of his
Modern Men of Letters, in that Second Edition which an impatient
public will soon demand at the hands of his happy publishers.
Modesty has of course prevented Mr. Hain Friswell from including
himself in his recent volume, but we, emulating Madame Tussaud's
alacrity, will add him to "the collection," and to make a good
beginning, will commence with him.
Mh. Hain Friswell.—The question may be put by an ignorant
and uneducated portion of the public, "Who is Mr." Hain Fris-
well?" We venture upon a paraphrase of "Kate Kearney" by
way of reply:
And did ye never hear of Haw Friswell?
What! not know by photos his phiz well;
"We don't know his books,
And we don't know his looks,"
Says the public of honest Hain Friswell.
We will tell you. He is an eminent Modern Man of Letters,
without whose works no gentleman's library can be considered com-
plete. His volumes will constitute the chief ornament of the
student's book-shelves for many years to come, and great care should
be taken to dust them regularly, as they are indeed well worth that
trouble. Had it been the good fortune of either Lord Macaulat
or Hallam to have had Mr. Hain Friswell as his master for style,
what might have been the result? Perhaps we may yet look
forward to a new edition of the Critical Essays or the Constitutional
History, reset, as it were, in good grammar by Mr. Hain Friswell.
In order to show how eminently fitted he is for the task of editing
these classics of our language, it will be sufficient to quote two
passages from his Modem Men of Letters. Of one of his Modern
Men he says:—
"He only 6neers at what he and society does not believe in."
Again:—
"These true pictures • • * have found an excellent illustration in a man
who has great merit, but which the age persists in accepting as an illustrative
artist."
If it is true that Genius is above rules, then assuredly Mr. Hain
Friswell is a Genius. That our author should, indeed, be a literary
giant might be (on what appears to us to be his own theory) ex-
pected, as he is of commanding stature, has imposing manners, a
tendency towards fire worship in the winter, and a telescopic nose.*
Mr. Swinburne.—A veteran writer of humorous prose for our
cheaper almanacks. Some of his jokes have materially contributed
towards the prosperity of small tobacconists who are acoustomed to
roll up "screws of bird's-eye in papers bearing evidence of Mb.
Swinburne's literary industry. None of his conundrums are with-
out some excellent moral. He also contributes in the same stylo to
the crackers which adorn our tables at Christmas-time. Mr. Fris-
well will be delighted to know that Mr. Swinburne is ten feet
high, and has dealt with the same washerwoman for the last six
years. We believe he pays her weekly. However, in order to be
strictly correct, Mr. H. F. can find out this for himself.
Charles Lever.—One of our most promising writers on mecha-
nism. His style is somewhat laboured, Dut he is always well dressed,
though still a trifle careless about his bootlaees. His works are
at present little known, but no doubt his fame will soon be widely
spread in consequence of his having been honourably mentioned by
Mr. Hain Friswell. .
Benjamin Disraeli.—An Irishman of the real old type. His lyric
works are only valuable as catalogues, in verse, of Derby winners, and
containing racy anecdotes of distinguished sportsmen. As to his
personal appearance, his short crop of light flaxen hair, fresh com-
plexion, and jaunty bearing, are as well known in the London streets
as are his blue tail-coat with brass buttons, knee-breeches, and
white hat with the short pipe stuck in its band. His object, perhaps,
of late years has been to gain rather the appreciative applause of the
music-halls than the indiscriminate laudation of the salons. The
public, however, would never have accorded him a place among
modern men of letters but for his good fortune in having been
included in Mr. Hain Friswell's series. _ •
Charles (Canon) Kingsley.—A nervous, timid, young man. no
is fortunate in possessing a nose, two ears, a forehead, and a Saxon
chin. He has, moreover, two eyes, hair on the ton of his head, a couple
of arms, and the average number of legs. Thus rarely gifted oy
bounteous Nature, he might have been anything, but he is only a
Canon. He employs a knife and fork for the purpose of cutting up
his food, and never eats tart except with a spoon. These are not the
habits of genius, and we cannot conceal our astonishment that Mr.
Hain Friswell has considered him as in any way worthy of his
notice. However, it is graceful in Genius to give mere Talent a lift.
Charles Reade.—A goody-goody writer of theSandfordand Merton
school. His books give promise of a certain excellence which we
trust he will, in time, redeem. Praise from Mr. Hain Friswell
is praise indeed; and this may urge Me. Reade to fresh exertions,
though it is perhaps a pity that he should continue to wear such
remarkably tight coats.
Mb. R. Browning.—Author of some of our most charming nursery
rhymes, "Ba! ba! black sheep!" and "Jack Horner." He has
not done much else. He is never subtle in expression, and may be
termed a Superficial Songster. He is called "Bobby B." by his
friends for the sake of alliteration. He is fond of taking a little
hot water with his bath, but, beyond this, is in no way addicted
to intemperate habits.
*»* We present Mr. Hain Friswell with the above stock of
information, and beg him to make what use he likes of it in his next
edition of Modem Men of Letters Honestly Criticised.
* This description is intended, on our part, as a piece of the sincereet
flattery (•'. '., if imitation be the sincerest flattery), for Mr. H. Friswell
says of another gentleman that" he cares little about religion, but has a photo-
j graphic eye." Surely the connection between Parses worship and a tele-
I scopic nose is as clear as this.

Bismarck is throwing his promised bouquets on the tomb of Napo-
leon. We hear that the bombardment of Paris has begun, that the
infernal inventions of Science, Moloch's toady, are slaying the
women and the little children, and that a Sunday night has been
appointed by the religious and gracious Germans for a feu d'enfer.
Take that as the war news in little, for I have no heart to write out
in full the chapter of murder. I suppose the end is at hand.
As if the last six months had not sufficiently sickened us with the
horrors of war, with slaughter, agony, and starvation, a party here
is agitating, as the vile phrase goes, for English interference, which
means, if it means anything, that unless we can patch up a peace
(and that is impossible), Englishmen are to be sent to be shot, muti-
lated, and starved. The original movers in this are so obscure that
they could do no mischief beyond irritating the ignorant part of the
German nation, and encouraging false hopes among the ignorant
French. But the enemies of the Government are hounding on
the agitators, for factious purposes; and but that Parliament is
about to meet, when a few statesmanlike speeches (if the Ministers
have courage and grace to make them) will set the popular mind
straight, I should see grave danger. But unless the Cabinet shew
itself a real Defence Committee, eschewing falsifications, I may
have to write to you of overthrow. The war has made us, I will not
say sullen, but very serious, and it will be ill work playing with us
now.
I remember telling you a good thing that was said at the time
when Scotland had it all her own way at Court. It was remarked by
a friend of ours that there was no keeping Scotch topics out of the
and that if the Speech from the Throne should begin,
way,
; What beauties doth Flora disclose,"
the inevitable following would be
"How sweet are her smiles upon Tweed."
Wo shall have a Speech from the Throne very soon. But, as you
know, Scotland is not much favoured by illustrious personages now,
so nobody but yourself will be reminded of the song.
My good friends the Americans have amused me. They are fond
of celebrations of all kinds, and I read that they have had one "in
honour of the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers. This is not at all
laughable, mind, for 1 look upon that landing to be the noblest gain
that mankind has had for ages. But how do you think it was
honoured by the descendants of the Fathers P By a Ball! And I
am happy to inform you that the ladies were, according to the
"fashion-reporters," most elegantly attired, and that it was difficult
to know which to admire most—their beauty, their robes, or their
dancing. I daresay they had a Mayflower Mazurka and a Pilgrim
Polka. Perhaps, after supper, some silver-voiced enchantress
(American for a good soprano) sang Mrs. Hemans' song:—
"When a band of exiles moored their bark
On the wild New England shore."
You do not deserve a letter at all, for I have heard nothing of you
for ten days, hut I suppose that you will allege disturbed communi-
cations. Perhaps our new Postmaster will make some better arrange-
ments. Meantime, the papers say that he has placed his Irish
country-seat at the disposal of Infallibility, should the Holy Chair
be uncomfortable. But you in Florence ought to know more about,
this than we do in London. If S. S. comes to Ireland the best way
will be to make him L. L. There may be a law or two in the way,
but a law is a thing which a breath can unmake as a breath has
made, according to our modern school of jurists, who have no

you love a man who can write a charming' hook for

Children are the only people worth writing for, because
they are the only critics of whom you can buy neither
flattery nor silence.
At a dinner the other night, at a house which you
know, but which 1 will not mention, some Painters were
present. Also, there was a huge specimen of the blatant
self-made" man, as ugly as sin, in faot a capital type
of the British Baboon. He, being rich, was very oivilly
treated, and at lust, pleased with the attention shown
him by a distinguished Artist, said, "I'mlikely to have
my portrait done for our Town 'All. I should like you to
do it." "Yon pay me a high compliment," said the
R.A., who would as soon have painted a whale. "Higher
than you seem to see," said another, quietly; "for you
are evidently mistaken for Landseer. But a knavish
speech slept in a foolish car.
I seldom go to the theatres (about which you asked
me, I suppose, because you did not know what else to
ask) in fine weather. Judge you, my dear Sir, whether
I am likely to go with the snow on the ground, and
the earth either a mirror or a marsh. I send you a
newspaper, whereby you niay perceive that a lady-
nianager has been fined bv a Police-Magistrate for
assaulting and scratching a "ballet-girl, to make her go
on the stage. It is a new sort of prompting, certainly.
The lady is she whom I once rather praised to you for
rebuking an audience whick took the liberty of judg-
ing a comedy. It is clear that she is energetic. I do
not know that I admire energy. Who is it that says,
"0 that people would learn that doing nothing is often
a Measure, and full as important a one as the most dili-
gent activitv!" Mv good friend Melbourne's first
question, when any difficult business was proposed was
"Can't you let it alone?" But that fine art is not
common. An American poet had it, and declared that it
was enough for him not to he doing, but to he. You laugh
at this from one who drives out, goes to the opera, then
sups, and sits up playing Loo with ladies. Why do
you laugh? Is that doing anything? Do you argue
in such fashion with your diplomatists, Sir Horace?
But read that case of the manageress, not for the
matter itself, which is very commonplace, but note the
tone of the evidence, and how singularly some of the
witnesses lost the use of their eyes and ears when the
quarrel occurred. I always thought loyalty a sort of
miracle, but did not know it could work miracles.
There, my longest paragraph is made out of a ridioulous
theatrical scandal, and that at a time of crisis. But I
am not ashamed of it, for are we not all fools, and
should we not talk according to our folly? In Japan
they retain the exquisite courteousness which the English
never had, and which the French have lost. There,
when a person commits an offence, they only say that
he has behaved " otherwise than was expected." Iam
no wiser nor better than other people, and I shall not
commit the offence of trying to be either, and disappoint-
ing your expectations. Nevertheless I am,

"No, Ma'am," said Mr. Oihtmbt at a Twelfth Night
Juvenile Party, " I do not like to see young people
enjoying themselves. It is a sight that awakens the
memory of enjoyments of which we are capable no more.
Suppose we have a rubber at whist, Ma' am. Which
of all those boys and girls do you think will say that
they like to see old people enjoying themselves? Eh,
Ma am!""
BENEVOLENT NEUTRALITY.
Both the Germans and the French keep abusing us
for observing neutrality between them. We incur this
invective by helping neither one Bide nor the other.
Possibly we might avoid it by giving help to both, and
assisting the Germans with a Fleet, and the French
with an Army.

THE MAN AND THE MAN'S FIELD.
Britannia bent her coasts and hearths to guard well,
Nor let the foe pitch into, or pooh-pooh her,
Has come to feel that though she speak by card well,
Equivocation may, e'er long, undo her.*
No more she'll keep two stools, lest she should fall
Betwixt War Office and Command-in-C'hief;
And in her military mess-books all,
Determines to turn over a new leaf.
Army reformers Colonels may call " rad,"
The prejudice 'gainst purchase deem a silly'un,
Declare the service going to the bad,
And as a triple villain rate Trevelyan.—
Her War Office, that maze without a plan,
Britannia yields, for new brooms and their plans field,
And calls out, "Do but you supply the man,
And you shall have the War Office for Man's field."

Or else equivocation may undo ua."—Hamlet.

It is deolared, by resolute Frenchmen, that the reduotion of Paris will not be
the reduotion ot France. Sooner or later, however, if the War goes on, France
will be so reduced in circumstanoes as to be unable to nay Germany the
damages which William the Pious might have seoured after Sedan. Then
the victors will be saddled with their own war-costs, and the overtaxed German
people will find the investment of Paris to have turned out a very bad one for
themselves.

A tieaht pure as the marble
His genius loved to mould,
But soft as that was stony,
And warm as that was cold.
Lips never tired of kindness,
Nature unwarned by guile;
Hands liberal in giving:
Sweet voice and sunny smile.
'Tis sad to think upon him,
Sleeping his hard-won sleep,
Among olive-woods and rose-fields,
By the blue Provencal deep.
Far from his Northern birthplace
On Ness's heathery shore,
Where old lives for this young life
Sit darkened evermore.
But why should weight of sadness
Burthen our minds for him,
Who to peace his way has wrestled,
Out of suffering strange and grim?
Leaving triumphant record
How little pain could do
To make that gentle nature
To its happy self untrue.
How, when big drops of anguish
On the wan brow would stand,
Still the swift-working fancy
Would guide the cunning hand.
Till beauty out of suffering
Was strangely seen to grow,
And Death seemed kept at distance
By Art's creative throe.
His death was not a lone one:
His dearest were at hand;
And he was of the lovable
Who love can still command.
'Tis we that are the losers,
Who lose such love, not he
Wrhose life here was but training
For the better life to be.
THE POPE AND HIS KING.
When the Foreign Ministers at Rome on New Year's Day went to
the Vatican to wish the Pope the compliments of the season, his
Holiness, according to the Dally News, asked the Austrian Ambas-
sador whether he had seen the Kino of Sardinia. The Minister
answered that he had not. His Holiness, smiling, rejoined:—
"And yet I am assured that he passed under j our window at 12 o'clock,
and that your flag was hoisted out of window."
If the Holy Father had been in the Austrian Ambassador's place,
and the Ambassador in the Holy Father's, Covin Mastai Fehretti
would perhaps have explained that he saw not the Kino of Sar-
dinia, but the Kxno of Italy. Pio Nono can crack a joke, if he
cannot take one.

To Sir Horace Mann.
Anything that you tell me, my dear Sir, I receive with an interest
which you will understand better than any one else. But what will
yon have? Frankly, I care very little for anecdotes of hypocrisy.
The world is telling them to me all day long, and a good part of the
night into the bargain. Did you ever hear of the Tzeremiseh Tar-
tars? I do not believe you if you say that you did. But hear this.
They have no particular religion, and they have an odd way of
excusing the fact. They say that they once had a religious book for
their guidance, but one day a cow came and ate it. Many folks
whom you and I know have not the excuse of the cow.
Why are you surprised at that strange piece of scandal having
been kept from society so long as you say it nas? In that charming
play, Le Due Job, there is a delightfiil word on the subject. A
secret need not be respectable, to be respected. Now that it has come
out, who is the worse, except those who have no longer the private
happiness of having a spiteful tale to reveal P
I met your friend X. (I omit the name—envelopes, like the rest of
creation, yield to steam) at a dinner. He sat near me, and rather
pleased me while he spoke only to his neighbours. But when he
wished to be heard all over the table, he had the bad habit which
shows a man not accustomed to be listened to for his own sake. He
began with some paradox, or something intended to startle. This
sort of thing should be left to a certain kind of preachers, who, I am
told, iind it attract vulgarians—the vulgar mind loves surprises.
X. has plenty of time before him, and may take liis social position
without jumping from spring-boards. Samuel Rogers, the poet, had
a valid excuse for his uncomforting talk. "My voice is very feeble,"
he observed, "and unless I said disagreeable things, no one would
attend to me." My dear Sir, imagine a man's caring about the at-
tention of a table full of persons for whom he cares nothing!
Your Italians affect great interest in commercial things; once they
were splendid merchants, and the affectation is not ungraceful. At
all events, it is better than that of our half-breeds, who pretend to
think that anything mercantile is beneath their notice. The word
bankrupt came from Italy, a fact you can preface to the little story
I am going to tell you. If I tell it wrongly, it is from no assump-
tion of ignorance; but I believe I have it right. A man forged a
bill on a well-to-do tradesman. He got wind of this, and warned
his bankers not to pay it. They naturally asked to see a list of the
paper he had out. They saw so much, that they closed his account,
and he was ruined—if any man can be ruined in these davs.
Wc have no election battles fighting at present. The Radical got
himself turned out of Norwich because the Whig's agent bribed a
man, and Whig and Badical having coalesced, the Law turned the
latter out. But do not talk to me of elections. They are tame
things in these days. In my time they were either the most gentle-
manly arrangements conceivable (a borough-holder returned you con-
ditionally on your never going near his borough, lest you disturbed
the faith in his authority), or they were ferocious battles, that ruined
a couple of families. Also there was humour about them. Even so
lately as the Liverpool Election, when George Canning, Lord Sefton,
and General Gascoigne stood, in 1818, 1 remember we "laughed
eonsumedly." For whenever (he Liberals put up a Sham Candidate,
the Tories did the same, and before the light was over there were
eighteen Shams. The Clubs never venture on sending down more
than one or two, now, and this with fear and trembling, for some-
times the sham man walks in, to the confusion of all decorous
bribery and corruption.

enter into my calculations. May I be defeated if it has been of my
makingj One of the principal motives which I have for my trust
that my enemies will be destroyed is, that I see in their conduct the
finger of Providence working that the traitors should be punished;
God so deprives their counsels of wisdom, that thinking to attack me
in a moment of weakness, they have, on the contrary, chosen the
time when I am strongest."
You see that he was as glib with his references to Providence as
any legitimate monarch could be. You remember what happened.
In a month from leaving St. Cloud he was at Potsdam. He wrote to
his wife, that, "with the help of God, complete triumph was cer-
tain." He gained it. What said the Prussians, asking for terms—
"What more can you want from us? The Duke of Brunswick
is dead; our generals are all killed, or wounded, or taken; the greater
part of our army has fled; surely your successes are sufficiently
grand."
How answered my gallant, good-for-nothing old acquaintance,
Soult, whose silver-topped coach was about the only thing worth
seeing in the last coronation procession (a coach, which, I believe,
was afterwards offered to a theatrical manager, who declined to buy).
The Frenchman said to the Prussians, "Lay down your arms, and
J will await the Emperor's orders in your regard."
The tables arc turned—but not risu.
Always yours,

THE STRENGTH OF RUSSIA.
rotting (with respect
to physical power)
upon the raw mate-
rial from which
Russia has to manu-
facture an army de-
signed to face the
troops of England
or Austria, the Cor-
respondent of the
Morning Post,at St.
Petersburg, states,
as the result of his
longexperience,that
"the Russian pea-
sant, though capable
of a passive endur-
ance bordering on
the incredible, has
little more than half
the muscular power
of the average Eng-
lishman." It may
well be that the
poorly-fed Russian
peasant is _ very
greatly inferior to
the average English-
man in muscular power. But in one particular, at any rate, the
former exceeds the latter in strength enormously. The practice of
daily ablution deprives the average Englishman of uracil strength
which he would otherwise possess. The Russian peasant is un-
addicted to that weakening habit. Hence, according to the report
of travellers, he is, in a way, very strong.

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
Mr. Robertson's War at the St. James's was a failure on the first
night. We italicise the "first night," and wish to draw attention
to the fact. A first night's audience is an exceptional audience,
which expression might mean an audience fond of taking excep-
tions. Its verdict ought never to be accepted as final, nor, m
the present state of things dramatic, ought professional critics
to pronounce upon the merits of a piece until its third or fourth
representation. Generally speaking, in spite of all the rehearsals,
the author himself only sees his l'lay, as a whole, on its first night.
Admitted that this is not as it should be,—yet so it is. We, in our
own patented form, and holding the first night's representation
to be the one on which no fair opinion can be formed, generally
wait until the piece has reached its fourth nijjht, and then, being
probably at its best, it is fair matter for criticism. We venture to
say, that if the public could have seen War for the first time on
its fourth night, it would not have been condemned.
The First Act would have passed muster as a specimen of one of
Me. Robertson's Prince of Wales' pieces without the Trincc of
Wales' company; the Second Act should have been called a Tableau,
and Monsieur Henri Nertann ought not to have been allowed to go
mad. In the Third Act all the young ladies, excepting, of course, the
heroine, might have been advantageously omitted, and then the
excellent rendering of a capital situation by Messrs. Young and
Brough, and the well-contrived denoiiment, would have brought
down the curtain on a real, though not, perhaps, a great success.
The piece should have been in two Acts and one Tableau.
The public, on the first night, was led to expect some strong exhi-
bition of partisanship apropos of the present state of affairs on the
Continent, not only from the title of the piece and the announcement
that Mr. O'Connor, the scenic artist, had been to Sedan for the
express purpose of illustrating the Second Act, but also from the
injudicious selection of French and German national airs by way
of Overture; a "happy thought" of the conductor's which went
far, we are convinced, to help the failure of the piece.
Having said thus much, wo wiU now proceed on the usual plan.
SUMMARY OF CHARACTERS IN "WAR."
Lottc. charmingly and intelligently played by Miss Fanny (mo, not
"Fann/jt, though the bill does say so in blue print) Brough.
Blanche, Jessie, Agnes, Katie {four frivolous and utterly pointless
young persons).
Colonel de Rochvannes (of the Theatre Gymnase, Paris. Pleasant,
when sane; uninteresting, and, in fact, a nuisance wlien mad).
Oscar de Rochvanncs (very good jeune premier—a role not easily
filled), Mr. Frederick (not "Fred," as in the bills, which
abbreviation smacks of Music Hall vulgarity, of which there is
not a trace in this young gentleman's performance) Mervin.
Herr Karl Hartmann (excellent every way), Mr. A. W. Young.
Captain Sound, R.N. (a first-rate performance. Hit reading the
letter, in Act III., is such a genuine touch of nature as lias not been
seen since Robson played Sampson Burr in the "Porter's Knot."
We certainly say, Go and see," in this part), Mr. Lionel
Brough.
ACT I.
Scene (on the Stage)—The List, Sevenoaks. Time, Midday. Scene
(off the Stage)—The Stalls. Time, 8 o'clock, P.M.

nothing to the Stall Keeper, and goes to his seat. To his Neiglibour,
pleasantly). It's begun some time?
Sedate Neiglibour. Yes.

talk to him.
Fidgety Person (while dialogue on stage goes on). Dear me!

odd. (To Sedate Person). Would you kindly allow me to look at
the bill?
[Sedate Person hands it to him. Sedate Person's icife looks across
at Fidgety Man angrily.

[Goes on for about two minutes about war and gloire.
Habitue (dubiously). Cm! Mistake!

Mr. Youno) is a Frenchman.

Captain Dyngwell (in Stalls, after dinner, giving his opinion on
Mr. Young). Ja, mein Herr! quite the gay German.
Here follotcs a lively meal on the stage, which isn't luncheon and
isn't dinner, but an airy banquet, consisting chiefly of a large
bouquet and an unripe pine-apple. All the young ladies seem to
enjoy it, a?id become more rapid than ever. They call on
Colonel Rocdivannes for a song. He sings. All join in

the right, and physically sure of being able to crush your enemy.
A WHOOP FOR WAR.
yes, Mn. Merriman, sound
your alarms,
Odger and Abplegartii,
shout ye, "To Arms!"
At the war's outbreak you
peace were all for—
Now have your windpipes
grown trumpets of war.
Had ye not reason to alter
your cry.
You and the workmen on
you who rely?
Fi ance that made war was
an Empire. That 'sgone;
But a Republic the war
carries on.
War with a monarchy,
France to befriend!
Money and blood bid tho
nation to spend;
What if you neither, your-
selves, bleed nor pay?
Agitate, clamour, that
other men may.
For a Republic can never
do wrong,
King Mob by right divine
reigns when he's strong.
Now the French people continue the fight,
War, at tirst wrong, becomes perfectly right.
Which of you would not an Income-tax stand,
On his week's earnings by head or by hand,
Though a large impost it were, on small gain,
So that it went the French fight to sustain?
Which, to serve France, would mind being shot dead,
Pierced through the stomach, the heart, or the head?
Having a bayonet thrust into his eye?
Or by a shell smashed his shin or his thigh?
Which would not hazard a jaw shot away,
Afterwards life to be borne as it may,
Minus the means he at present employs
Wisely in making a valorous noise?
Heed not the scoffers who meanly inquire
Why not yourselves join the French under fire,
'Stead of demanding, with wild waste of breath,
Mission of others to torture and death 'i
O, by the Royal Command you are tied,
Being forbidden to help either side,
But to keep neutral both nations between:
Here you stay out of respect for the Queen.

A CAPITAL NOTION.
A provincial contemporary, reporting an evening festival, says,
"The Chairman at intervals gave tha audience permission to join in con-
versation, a permission which was accepted most readily, and added
considerably to the enjoyable nature of the proceedings."
This is probable enough. Whether the enjoyment would have
been shared by the platform speakers and the vocalists, if'they had
heard what was said about their efforts, is a matter of speculation.
But the precedent is a good one, and might be followed with advan-
tage at most meetings. Audiences would listen with more attention,
if they knew that they would occasionally have " an interval of live
minutes for abuse of the performers."
In the Interest of Peace!
It is not the intention ot Government to employ the Italian organ-
grinders in re-organising the British Army. The re-organisation of
our Army is designed to avert war, an object that would be frus-
trated by any means comprehending those noisy vagabonds; for
there is no peace wherever they are.

THE "NEC PLUS ULSTER" GREAT-COAT.
(INTENDED FOK COLD, BUT NOT MUDDY, WEATHER.)
HEE BAPTISM OF FIRE.
We saw her, the witching, the wanton, the winning,
In the flush of her music, her meats and her wine,
The Circe that gave such a glory to sinning,
That dallianco seemed duty, and evil, divine.
Such the spell of sweet eyes, and bright beautiful face,
Men swooned to behold them, and died to embrace.
We walked in her chambers, amidst a soft dimness
Of folds wreathed and woven and cunningly flung
To tame into touching and tender the grimness
That under that weird face's witchery clung:
And through the white veils came a tremulous glow,
Iiike the rose of the sunset through wind-winnowed snow.
And more bright for those clouds gathered artfully round her
Shone the light of her cheek and the lure of her eye,
Till we asked not whence came the allurement that crowned her,
But yearned for her kiss, though to kiss were to die.
All races and regions their worshippers gave,
And none but was fain to be some time her slave.
So she revelled and ruled, wiled, and wantoned, and won,
Like to her seen in Patmos in purple attired,
Deckt with gold and fair stones that shot light as the sun,
In her hand a gold cup, for their lips that desired,
Of all filthiness full, and a name on her brow,
That seemed fitting her then, but so seemeth not now.
For behold, o'er her borders the foeman has stormed,
And her guards set to meet him like straws swept away;
And now at her gate his battalions have formed,
And close and more close draw their iron array:
Sure the white, wanton witeh in her drap'ries must cower,
As the breakers of battle beat loud at her bower.
But lo, what a change in that face false and fair,
And those soft supple limbs, late in dalliance entwined!
She has torn off the rose-wreath that trailed in her hair,
She has knit up her loose looks that played in the wind;
For her silks and her laces, hath clothed her in steel,
And from wanton grown warrior, from proud head to heel.
For her meats of the costly, her wines of the choice,
She eats of the coarse, and she drinks of the cheap:
The smooth limbs that wont in down beds to rejoice,
On the straw by the bivouac watch-fire can sleep;
And her brow hath ta'en sternness, and hardness her hand,
And the lips that lisped love-songs sound words of command.
Nor the shot and the steel of the foeman alone
She has found—this soft wanton—endurance to face;
With worse waste of the heart, than the shot's of the stone,
The slow tooth of Famine its way gnaws apace;
And the warmth in her blood aiding famine to kill,
The winter Frost creeps with its death-dealing chill.
And at last with the Famine and Frost has come Fire,
On that head, erst so dainty, its baptism to pour,
Till her crown of proud towers topples down in the mire,
And death-shrieks are shrill through the crash and the roar.
Is't despair or defiance thus nerves her to stand.
Though shivered hilt-high is the sword in her hand?
Bids her hold her bent brows still confronting the flame,
Whose hot hungry tongue licks her beautiful hair,
As if in its tires she would purge sin and shame,
Draw strength from starvation, defence from despair,
Till we ask in amazement and awe—Can it be (
Is this Dalilah, Queen of Earth's Wantons, we see?
Is this Amazon, shrunk, stricken, scathed, but still proud,
And so staunch in hard steel, tho soft silken-robed dame,
That with wine of her witchcraft made drunken the crowd,
Till from men they waxed beasts, and thereof had no shame?
Can War's Are so wickedness, wantonness slav,
That her foul shall grow fair, and her dross slough away?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PECULIAR PEOPLE.
nr. extravagant man hired a
cab to look out for an omnibus.
The man of gallantry es-
corted his Scotch mother-in-
law underneath the mistletoe,
although he knew beforehand
that she had been taking snuff.
The sanguine man expected
to tind a policeman when he
wanted one.
The credulous man believed
the assurance of a cab-driver
that a long circuit was needf ul,
because the streets were being
paved.
The lazy man allowed his fire
to go out, rather than ring the
bell to bid somebody to poke it.
The cheerful man enjoyed
the half-hour that he spent in
waiting for his dentist.
The punctual man served
out the soup for his eleven
expected guests, when only
three of them had actually
arrived at the appointed hour
for eating it.
The hasty man sat down to read Paradise Lost, and afterwards
was heard to boast that he got through it at a sitting.
The hopeful man twice gave a cab-driver a sovereign for a shilling,
and twice cherished the delusion that it would be returned to him.
The man of fortitude was brave enough to open his front-door
himself, when he saw the tax-gatherer, the gas-man, and the rate-
collector knock at it.
The cautious man never went a mile away from home without
taking his umbrella with him, and putting a corkscrew, pen and
ink, and a bill-stamp in his pocket.
The gluttonous man, by bribery, went beforehand to the supper-
room, and devoured the liver-wings of all the fowls displayed there.
The reckless man was bold enough to take his wife down Regent
Street, and tell her that he had a ten-pound about him.
The modest man was tempted to return thanks for the brides-
maids, and, to avoid his chaffing friends, was caught next day at
Gravesend in the act of emigration.

PUNCH'S COUNTY FAMILIES.
Revised and Corrected for 1871.
Rockingham, Geoffrey Devereux, Esq., of Fernhurst, Yoickshire.
Born 1790; tine old English gentleman; wears a blue coat and
brass buttons, and uses gilt-edged letter paper; drinks port: still
hunts with the firinklcy hounds, and has snot several woodcocks his
season. Married, in 1811, Marian Chaloner, only child of Sir Lawford
Cumberland, Bart., of Four Parlours, Parkshire, and hasten children
living, fifty-three grandchildren, and nineteen great-grandchildren;
his eldest son, Bertram Cumberland (author of The Rifle and the
Rod), is M.P. for Mid-Yoickshire, the husband of the handsomest
woman in the county, and almost as popular as "the old Squire"
himseU:.
This is the family which is in possession of the celebrated'1 Rocking-
ham " ghost. Great reserve is maintained as to the behaviour of
this uncomfortable visitor, but the following account may be relied
on as an authentic version of the story, compiled with considerable care
and expense from family muniments, county histories, the lips of
terrified maid-servants, and the resources of a fertile and cultivated
imagination.
In the north wing of Fernhurst, which is overgrown with ivy,
and haunted by the hooting owl and flitting bat, there is a long
wainscoted gallery of polished oak, hung round with family portraits,
hereditary samplers, stags' antlers, pikes, arquebuses, burgonets,
morions, cheraux-de-frise, and other precious heirlooms from the
time of the Crusaders. This favourite resort of the family was lately in
the hands of the painters, who are in the receipt of weekly wages, and
reside, when at home, in the neighbouring market-town of Bvecross.
(These and other particulars may seem irrelevant, but tncy are
absolutely indispensable to the full elucidation of the mystery.) The
most athletic and intelligent artisan of the party, a high-shouldered
man.with a slight defect m his hearing, and a patch on his waisteoat,
was passing along the gallery in the twilight of a winter's afternoon,
whistling a popular melody, and thinking of tho upper housemaid,
to whom he was engaged to be married at Whitsuntide, when the
door of an apartment at the extreme end slowly opened, and a
figure emerged, cloaked from head to foot in white, and bearing
under its right arm a small mahogany chest, which glittered in the
moonlight, and was evidently bound with brass, and as good as new.
The figure approached, and beckoned to the terrified mechanic.
In his agitation ne dropped a new paint-brush, and ceased to think
of the upper housemaid, who had that very day given notice of her
intention to leave at the expiration of the month. It beckoned him
a second time. He stood rooted to the carpet, and wiped his brow
with a checked handkerchief, on which the dew of agony stood in
great beads. It beckoned to him for the third and last time, point-
ing with an angry gesture to its bared throat, and advancing with
hasty but noiseless strides towards the spell-bound journeyman
painter, uttering the while an unearthly cry, which reached the
whist-party in the blue drawing-room, and led to the match being
finally broken off.
An hour afterwards, thehigh-shouldered painter, with a defect
in his hearing and money in the savings' bank, was found by the
upper housemaid in a dead faint on the gallery floor, the basket of
tools lying untouched by his side, and a faithful hound licking his
face and hands. His first words on coming to himself were—" It
made me touch the place on its throat and "he fainted away
again. The upper housemaid, who had been six years in the family,
and lived before in good places, burnt brown paper under his nos-
trils steeped in vinegar, and had recourse to her smelling-bottle, his
gift to her on her last birthday. He revived again, but no persuasion
could induce him to resume the thread of his narrative. They were
married, and went out to New Orleans, but no clue to the mystery
was ever obtained, except in a soda-water bottle which was washed
ashore on the coast of Labrador, and is now in the hands of the
constabulary.

FBOST AND SNOW.
A Royal Academician presents his compliments to Mr. Punch:
and you might make a good joke about Sir Francis Grant's ser-
vants' neglect to sweep away the snow, thereby causing the respected
P. R. A. to be fined. I think the joke should be that Frost having
been lately favoured by the Academy, the servants did not like to
be hard upon Snow, or something of that sort, don't you see I' and
so oblige R. A.

SHRIMPS AND STATESMAN.
Greenwich, unsolicited, elected Gladstone. Well, for once in
its life, Greenwich did a worthy thing, and might quietly have
reposed upon its mud and laurels. But Greenwich has been stirring
up its mud, and is likely to lose its laurels. It has permitted meet-
ings to signify to the world that Shrimptown is displeased with
Gladstone. The Premier has been asked to resign. Mr. Punch
has.awaited a counter-demonstration, which should have atoned for
the impertinence to Mr. Gladstone. But as this amends has not
been made, Mr. ranch deems it right to let the world perceive the
intellectual character of the personages who, in the name of Shrimp-
town, decline the honour of being represented by the Premier. The
following paragraph, extracted from a contemporary, should be cut
on a marblo slab, and set up in Greenwich Hospital:—
"The speech delivered by Captain Dominy, the chairman of the
Greenwich meeting on Monday night, was unique in its way. The
speaker having a weak voice, could not make himself heard, but he
kindly handed his manuscript to the reporters. We quote the docu-
ment :—' The succour render to Mr Gladstone in this Brorough he
has indignatly Kepeled By Driving upwards of 1000 familys to seek

building yards is felt by every Tradesman in the Borough. Even
the Greenwich Taverns has felt his Pruning Knife. Mr Gladstone

Manufactorys and shipbuild yards one of the Greatest Boroughs in
England He could have created it a ltoyal Borough had he been so
disposed Particular so has Royality Besides thereat. He could not
introduce his Kadicalism to overturn the constitution of England in
which the country took so great a pride. (Cheers).'"
Mr. Gladstone is as well as can be expected, considering this
terriflc speech and the bad weather, but his friends are anxious.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHO WILL TEACH THE TEACHERS?
Ho, indeed? Now that uni-
versal education is the order
of the day, and everybody
has decided upon educating
everybody, the question
where to get the teachers is
becoming a momentous one,
and everybody nearly is en-
deavouring to answer it . A
correspondent of the Times
fills a column and a quarter
with his notions on the sub-
ject, and tells us he considers
training-colleges for teach-
ers are the only source by
which sufficient educating
power can be nationally
supplied. It appears from
the statistics wherewith he
backs his arguments, that
in 18G9
"25,342 teachers had charge of
an average of 1,062,999 scholars,
or there was one teacher • • for
rather less than 12 scholars."
Forty-two to one are longish odds against a master, and one can
hardly wonder at the ignorance of people who never had a chance of
being taught by something better than the forty-second fraction of
a man. But it is estimated now that " in England and Wales
teachers will be needed for more than 3,500,000 scholars," and there
is therefore ample reason why our present training-colleges, which,
if full, can only furnish and keep up a staff of five-and-twenty
thousand teachers, should be increased and made sufficient for the
work they ought to do. These colleges are not so attractive to young
men as those at Oxford or at Cambridge, for it seems in sixty-nine
there were not twelve thousand teachers from them in our schools.
So the suggestion is thrown out that scholarships be founded, "to
be awarded annually, upon competition, to the best pupil-teachers
completing their apprenticeship. It is thought that such a bait
will catch a shoal of candidates; and it is suggested that " the trials
of teaching in classes should be conducted before some master of a
model school." As, doubtless, every master deems his school a model
one, there mav be some slight trouble in deciding who shall be the
happy man elected to occupy this post. Perhaps the wiser course
would be to confide the duty to the hands of Mr. Punch. Elemen-
tary education is not much in his way, but Lord Lawrence very
probably when Governor of India had small notion of becoming
Chairman here in London of an Education Board. Elementary
education does not merely mean an education in the elements; and,
even if it did, Mr. Punch knows quite enough of earth and air and
water to stand the fire of criticism on any of the questions he, as
Model Schoolmaster, might see fit to propose. "With what sort of
test-questions Mr. Punch would teach the teachers, he will not for
worlds now venture to proclaim. Still, as a smattering of every-
thing, from chemistry to classicality, and from history to hydro-
statics, is by many folks considered elementary education, the
following may serve as well as any other as a sample of the problems
Mr. Punch, in his omniscience, might determine to put forth:—
1. Who invented plum-pudding? And what did he do with it,
after he invented it?
2. Who were the Gracchi? And did their mother know when
they happened to be out?
3. Why, except for profit, do so-called Christian butchers raise
the price of Christmas beef?
4. Do you know the question whereof this is the answer, Because
one is a mistletoe and the other is a missal too?
5. History relates that next morning he repented of that last
cigar he smoked. Of whom is this related, and where is the record
writ?
6. An ounce of ozone is as heavy as a feather-weight of oxygen.
Describe the process of determining this interesting fact.
7. Was it Junius or Julius C«sar who said that England's best
bulwarks were her wooden heads?
8. Can a bill at sight be legally made payable at a Blind Asylum?
9. Multiply £983,257 8s. Ud. by £3,429,628 Is. 6}rf., and divide
the proceeds between the Hospital for Incurables and the Idiot
Asylum.
10. In what year were the Greek Calends established? How
many were there, and what was their relation to the Three Calenders
in the Arabian Nights f
11. Why does an English cook, when she wants to broil a chop,
moke up such a fire as is enough to broil an elephant?
12. State, from history, your reasons for believing that Alfred
the Great was in reality a dwarf.

PIANO! PIANO!
The Musical World contradicts a report that Madame Arabella
Goddard meditates retiring from public life. It was proper that
the report should be contradicted, although no one believed it.
Madame Arabella Goddard will retire from public life when Mr.
Punch shall request her to do so, and not until then. We may add,
that that lady is engaged to perform a symphony, in honour of his
Hundredth volume, which will appear twenty years hence, and she
will continue to perform publicly on all fitting occasions in the mean-
time. It is a good while since he wrote of
"the gifted Miss Goddard,
Whom with admiration all the critical squad hoard,"
but his affections are as unaltered as her powers, or rather, both
have strengthened by time. Bless him, how elegantly he can turn a
compliment when he gives his mind to it!
PARLIAMENTARY ECONOMY.
The saying that "Half a loaf is better than no bread" is a
perfect truism, but a defective proverb. Half a loaf is, indeed, in
so far as it can sustain life, a great deal better than no bread what-
soever. But half an Army is not, likewise, better than no Army at
aU. On the contrary, if half an Army means an Army not more
than half enough to suffice for national defence, it is worse than no
Army. It is worse by the money which it costs, and the taxation
which it therefore necessitates, that is, by so much useless expense.
What is true of the Army is equally true of the Navy. Do you
hear, Gentlemen of the House of Commons, about to waste breath,
and perhaps money?
ALL IN THE FAMILY.
"A curious discovery has been made among Lord Palmerston's papers,
namely, his manuscript Diary of two visits to Paris, in the eventful years
1814 and 1815. As the Diary was found only after the publication of the
Life by Sib H. Bulwer, the Hon. Cowper Temple will give it to the public
through the Temple Bar magazine."
The Hon. Cowper Temple has evidently an eye for the fitness of
things, in selecting the Temple Par magazine as the proper channel
for the publication of the Diary of Henry John Temple, Viscount
Palmerston.
Comfort for the Afflicted.
This is a luxurious age. Our houses, churches, schools, gaols,
museums, &c, are warmed with hot air or water; and now it seems
that even our musical instruments are to be made comfortable
by similar means, for we see advertised "Warm keys (for cold
hands), in pianos and harmoniums."

And cried to his messmates, "I'm faithful to Poll!"
Faithful to Poll,

He let 'em all drown, to be faithful to Poll.
He met a Princess, of the tribe Kikaroo,

"Good-bye," says the Captain. "Be faithful to Poll."

REAL AND SHAM ROSES.

The healthy exercise of Skating, young Ladies, is highly con-
ducive to the development of Bloom on the cheek of Beauty. De-
velopment of Bloom, dears, is easily distinguishable from super-
imposition. That is to say, everybody who has eyes, and is not
totally colour-blind, can tell the daub out of the rouge-pot from
the natural rose. Now, loves, to any man except a fellow of the
baser sort, the paint-spot on the cheek is as a plague-spot. It is
worse than the neetic patch which poor consumptive girls cannot
help; a painter by profession would rather admire a face flushed
with scarlatina. Far less becoming is it than the crimson con-
tracted by a good domesticated eligible girl at the kitchen fire, in
basting a leg of mutton. A sham erubescence, alas, is sometimes
visible, and remarkable, on certain cheeks which would be reddened
all over by knowledge of the sort of patterns taken in wearing it.
Darlings, it may not be impossible to give you some idea of the
imitation which you practise in painting your faces.
Suppose the custom of dyeing hair and whiskers had become pre-
valent among young men. Perhaps even you yourselves would
rather despise the impostors who adopted it. Imagine, however,
that, besides, you knew that this custom was originated by the vilest
and most vicious scamps, and used to bo peculiar to them, and dis-
tinctive of their class, what would you say to any man, who, having
made himself look as much as possible like one of them, asked to
dance with you?
Brand yourselves, sweets, no longer with the Jezebel-smear.

At the Lyceum. Italian Opera Bonffa Company. Done in Two
Visits.
Visit the Fibst.—To sec Crispino e la Comare. Remarkable, as
a Comic Opera, for its peculiarly heavy lightness, the long " waits,"
•'. e., intervals of about twenty-five minutes between the Acts, its
charming costumes, and elaborate scenery. Magenta inexpressibles
and blue velvet coat were, perhaps, the least striking among the
dresses; while the scene being generally the same, there was plenty
of time given to the audience to discover its beauties. Habitues of
the Italian Opera had seen Patti in it, and wouldn't care for anvone
else; and those who hadn't seen Patti, began to wish they had.
The Trio of Doctors, "Batti batli, tira tira," obtained a nearty
encore, and was unquestionably the successful thing of the piece.
Visit Number Two.—In state, to see Signob Bottesini's Ali
Bmba, for which we will suggest the more appropriate title of
THE MUSICAL ALI BABA;
OR,
THE PIANO-FORTE THIEVES.
ACT I.
SCENE 1 (on the Stage).—The Ground-Floor of Ali Baba's house.

Musical Amateur (arriving in Stalls after the Curtain has risen).

expenses to the purchase of the Stalls only, depreciatingly). A book's

A selection from the very latest letters of the honourable
HORACE WALPOLE, OF STRAWBERRY HILL. FAVOURED BY Oiyt
PRIVATE SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
To Sie Horace Mann.
We hear that Paris is ready to surrender, unless the German
Emperor demands more than, even in her distress, she can grant.
Favre vibrates between Versailles and the city. That is all I know,
and more than I care to know. So that the bloodshedding be stopped,
I am content, for the hour, and he is not very wise who looks much
further. Who is guilty of the slaughter worked by a bombardment,
those who bombard, or those who turn a vast capital into a fortress
which by the laws of war may be bombarded? I am not concerned
to allot shares in the crime, but when I read that a shell descended
among four little children, chatting in the street, and blew them to
pieces, I could wish to see the commanders on both sides tied to the
mouths of guns—soft-hearted as I am, I believe that I could with
linstock then the devilish cannon touch.
I am not quite such a buzzard, dear Sir, but that I see your hint
not to write too freely about your masters. Well, I will say that the
present Government is the noblest, finest, wisest, grandest, safest
that ever was, or ever will be—until the next comes. If everybody
else does not think so, that is not mv fault. As the children say, I
am not Everybody. No doubt the Ministers themselves are of my
way of—speaking, and sing admiringly to one another, as Miss
Seward sang to Temper Hayley.
Bob Lowe.
"Noble Premier, England's glory,
Mr. Gladstone, that is you."
Gladstone.
"Sir, you carry all before ye,
Trust me, Brilliant Bob, you do."
And, sincerely, I admire them both, and several of their colleagues.
There! As you, like Don Quixote, are afraid to have your helmet
tried by a sword-cut, for fear the head-piece should give way, when
it would be so much more prudent to let it be split on your head, I
have done. Only, should there be a split, you will be good enough
to remember who was the deaf adder that stopped his ears. Not,
my dear Sir, that you at all resemble an adder, though I must own
that in the business you tell me of with the brace of soldiers you
showed yourself endowed with some of the serpent's craft. You
checkmated them both, but then what says George Meredith •
When for one serpent tcerc tiro asses match?
Father Hyacinthe, the eloquent, hath indited a long letter to the
Bishops of his Church. He speaks of " the thunderclap that'burst
over the Vatican in reply to the impious dogma." Also, Hyacinthus
protests against the celibacy of the clergy. It is a difficult question.
If you let a priest marrv, there is danger of his thinking too much
about his own wife. If vou don't—but what have you or I to do
with the ecclesiastics? By Dodo, who was the mother of Zoroaster,
they give a deal of trouble, considering the amount of good they do.
We have been favoured with their assistance for some thousands of
years, and at this moment some hundreds of thousands of men are
cutting one another's throats. But then the priests say we won't
listen. That is surely very childish. Why do they not make us
listen, as anybody worth listening to always does? However, I am
imitating them, and preaching an absurd sermon.
I have been dragged to some theatres lately; but I have seen
nothing to afflict you with. The women in society have only one
word now, and it is " awfully." I hate it, but it suits me at the

Major Johnson said, truly, enough, of Congrcve that his comedies
surprise rather than divert, and so have in some degree the operation
of tragedies. What I have witnessed certainly did not divert me,
but it had the operation of tragedy to the extent of causing surprise
that such productions are called plays. There is very little real act-
ing, which is not so much the actors' fault as their misfortune, for
they have neither models nor schools, and they have a most ignorant
public that neglects the best and applauds the worst efforts. There
are a few pretty faces on the stage, not many, and their owners are

The weather is savage. I had thought that the god
Thor was established, but he has had his Sedan. The
mercury is ever such a way below freezing. Those an-
thropophagi,—or is the word antipodcans ?—are revelling
al fresco, with wisterias and winecups, and in the sun-
shine, until, as with Gargantua's friends, it is a stceet
and a heavenly sound to hear them laugh. I read the
insulting tale in the Times the other morning, and I
annotated it with execrations because I could not unnumb
my fingers. When I meet my ancestors in Elysium, they
shall have a piece of my mind about their settling in this
abominable island, whose only merit is its beef, which I
hate. But the silver sea? fhato that too, for it makes
me sick. But Liberty? My dear Sir, now it is your
turn to begin to preach. Moreover, we have no liberty.
J sent my footman to drive away a brute of an organ-
player from before my window in Arlington Street last
month, and because the wretch would not move Tom, gave
him a shove, and next day was summoned for an assault.
Liberty, indeed! The Romans represented her with a
eat at her feet, but here she is the cat herself.
I was teadrunkwith'd, t'other afternoon, by some plea-
sant ladies, mostly known to you. One of them dropped
the cream-jug. An elder one, of the sort that loves pro-
verbs, one who should have sat to Dean Swift for his
Polile Conversation, said, "Well, my dear, no use cry-
ing over spilt milk." "No, Mamma," was the answer,
"I dare say there's water enough in it already." Now
I look at it on paper, I do not think that it is so very
clever; but we laughed consumcdly, and you are to do
tho same. It could not have been premeditated, but
came out anshum scranshum, as we say in Lincolnshire.
Perhaps, as you have once or twice rudely observed, Sir,
I make too much of anything said or done by my
favourites. Do not be ungrateful; I always praise you,
and prophesy your being our foreign Minister, though 1
wish you a better office, in these days when England is
utterly humiliated and degraded, and blotted out from
the map of Europe as much as Britain was when Horace
wrote of us. There, I see you laughing at me again.
Really, Sir Horace Mann, you very great diplomatists
have very little manners.
Adieu. I forgive you. I might have been harsher, but
that Sol is actually pouring half a pint of sunshine into
England, and I must go out and get my thimbleful.
Ever yours,
HORACE WALl'OLE.
P.S. An alumnus of Owen's College, Manchester, Mr.
John Hopkinson, of that city, is the Senior Wrangler this

poem to suit the event:—
Owen's praise demands my song,

"The Queen, the King, and the Virtuous Lady." You
shall have three, nay three times three, nay thirty

sent. They are not Twelfth Night characters, or charac-
ters in a Christmas pantomime, or persons in an allegory,
or devices in a transparency, or figures on an Odd Follows
flag, or sculptures on a Town Hall, but—Three Mines!

A QUESTION FOR EVERYBODY.
Can I afford it? Pay your iS'ewsman '3d. for a Number of Punch, and
a reply.
The cost of increasing our military armaments on a scale exceeding that of the
forces maintained by the Great Powers of the Continent, so as to enable us to
fight them, on their own ground, and at the same time defend our country and
our colonies, is pointed out in Punch's Cartoons and Articles.
The additional cost of keeping up a Navy sufficiently powerful to defy a com-
bination of all the fleets in the world, is set forth in the Cartoons and Articles
of Punch.
Punch's Cartoons and Articles indicate that it is impossible for a nation to be
both a commercial and a military one, and for an island which has not a large
commercial marine to have a sufficient Navy.
In the Cartoons and Articles of Punch, the useless expense of doing tilings
by halves is insisted on.
The necessity of organising a perfectly complete system of national defenoe
before going to the further expense of preparations for intermeddling in our
neighbours' quarrels, is inculcated in the Cartoons and Articles which Punch
contains.
For some idea of the Income-tax which will be the consequence of a departure
from the policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, see the Cartoons and
Articles in Punch.
NOTES OF A NATURALIST.
The Gad-fly is a rover, never staying long in one place.
The favourite amusement of the Arctic Bear is swarming up the North Pole.
Of all the Mammalia the Ounce weighs the least.
When I ask a Boy in the street to run after a Cab for me, I call him my Fly-
catcher.
The rarest kind of Shell-fish is, undoubtedly, the Siberian Crab.
The notes of the Sand-piper are especially appreciated in Scotland.
The Opossum is a quadruped of great ability, able to do almost anything
you ask nim, as, indeed, his name signifies, for, translated out of Latin into
English, it means neither more nor less than "Oil can."

NEAT, BUT ALSO GAUDY.
PuNCn has more than
once signified his
opinion of his con-
temporary called
Public Opinion, "A
gatherer and dis-
poser of other men's
scraps," it usually
empties a wallet of
acceptable matter,
and is especially to
be commended for its
extracts and trans-
lations from foreign
papers. Even the
Turkish and Arabic
organs, the Rahat el
Halkam, and the
Mafesch, are looked
after, by some eru-
dite member of the
staff, and their Ma-
hometan mumblings
are translated for us.
Thus far we have
only praise for P. 0.
But it has a depart-
ment devoted to the
lucubrations of amateur correspondents, and truly we wish that
these articles could be eliminated, and their place filled with
something readable. For of all the bumptious bores who afflict
the pnbhc, P. O.'s correspondents are the biggest. They are ex-
ceptionally a nuisance. Yet to the exceptionals there is exception.
If the following letter has not slipped from under its proper head-
ing "Amusing," the vigilant sub-editor must have been at fault
in sticking it amid the pretentious dulnesses of other correspondents.
Sib,—The bombardment of Paris is a pieco of savagery which it is the
sacred duty of neutral Cabinets possessing an ounce of manliness to prepare
themselves to avenge by a compact coalitiou against the brutal and thievish
stratocracy of Gcrmania, led on by the accursed blood-spiller and lying blood-
hound of 'Prussia—now the mushroom Emperor of Teutons—and his Chan-
cellor Biskakcx, the most unmitigated scoundrel and blackguard that ever
called himself, or was called, a statesman.—Tour faithful servant,
Stratford, E. Edmund >'eatk.
If this style is after the present school of Stratford atte le Bow,
we hope that academy will long prosper, for the diversion of man-
kind. And if our friend P.O.'s other correspondents were a tenth
part as entertaining as the impetuous Mr. Neate, we should not
recommend the editor (as we respectfully do) to "reform them
altogether." See what disturbance such a writer causes in Europe.
We know that in consequence of his letter, the German Emperor
has abdicated, Count von Bismarck has gone into a monastery, and
all the "Teutons" are preparing to emigrate, under assumed

A GEM OF A "WITNESS.
We admire Testimonials, whether presents or letters, and wc
believe implicitly in all the merits which they reward or proclaim.
Here is a lovely one, of the literary kind. We take it from a
chiropodist's advertisement.
"Four or five years ago, Ma. • • * • * successfully extracted several corns
from my feet, without pain, as also a member of my family, which have not
returned since that time."
We have not the least idea as to what has happened to this
gentleman, but whatever it is we believe it, and especially con-
gratulate him on the non-return of a member of his family. For
one's relations are often as much bother as one's corns—and won't
always be cut.
The Present Art of Poetry.
Write a profusion of rhythmical and melodious nonsense, amidst
which, at distant intervals, here and there introduce an intelligible
line. The dullest idea therein expressed will shine like a star amid
surrounding darkness.
A WANT IN THE STATUTE-BOOK.
A law should be passed without any further delay, early in the
coming Session, if possible, making the importation into this afflicted
country of foreign street musicians—contraband.
"CALL OFF THE DOGS!"
"... At his heels
Shall Famine, Sword, and Fire, leashed in like hounds,
Crouch for employment."
Shakspcare, Henry V., C/wnu Ad I.
Count-Huntsman, wind a mort—Tahaut, tahaut!
The stubborn quarry stands no more at bay:
With blood-fleck d sides, great eyes of pride and woe,
That half disclaim the pity which they pray,
Faint and fore-spent, he strives, in spite of wounds,
To bear a brave show of defiance still,
And to the onset of these eager hounds
Opposes barrier of a desperate will.
Had royal hunter e'er more royal game,
Than this that these trained war-dogs have pulled down,
While his hosts crowned their master, bv the name
Of Kaiser, with the Reich's Imperial Crown?
Was e'er great hart more staunchly run to death,
After long agony of hopeless fight,
Than this, that now draws agonising breath,
With draggled skin, and eyes of tearful light?
A tiling it seemed for pleasance of a Queen,—
Formed to add loveliness of moving life
To the still beauty of some woodland scene;
Daintily nurtured, for no sterner strife
Than that of white hands, vying which should wreathe
The stately crest or stroke the glossy side;
No ruder breath than summer's wont to breathe,
Nor worse chaco than fair ladylove's to bide—
Not fit to face these war-dogs, chested deep.
Strong-limbed, steel-sinewed, silent, tough and true;
Whose tanged jaws spring-like shut and vice-like keep;
Muzzled and eyed to hunt by scent or view:
And the more wonderful, that, war's work o'er,
More docile beasts ne'er guarded house or herd;
More patient drudges ne'er all labour bore
That masters' cunning has to dogs transferred.
But nought save war-dogs' training now they show,
With hot breath and hoarse bay and savage bound
Circling their over-matched and out-worn foe.
That rests a torn flank on the bloody ground,
Betraying what defiance fain would hide,
That strength no more can wage unequal strife,
Yet to ill-fortune scarce can conquer pride,
And unto hounds or huntsmen sue for life.
Well has the quarry striven, and, lacking skill
Of fence, yet done its best to use its tines,
With thrusts too short, yet swift and sharp to kill,
But baffled by the hunter's cunning lines,
Tripped and entangled in the toils it lay,
And the fierce dogs leapt on it, one and all,
Which, blind and bleeding, still 'twould shako away,
Stagg'ring to feet again, again to fall.
Till the strength wasted, and the raw wounds chilled,
All the more, when to aid the war-dog Sword
Came his fierce fellows, Fire that is not tilled,
And Famine, hound of Hell, lean and abhorred:
And for the task that shot and steel defied,
Famine and Fire out of the leash were sprung,
And fixed their fangs in the sore-wounded side,
And on the bleeding flanks and fore-hand hung.
And now the work is wrought—the hunt is done:
Hunter and hunted both may count the cost;
They, what the strength or glory they have won,
It what the worth of all that it has lost.
Call off thy dogs, 0 huntsman stern and strong,
With life, at least, let up thy bleeding prey;
Couple thy war-hounds—who knows for how long,
Or what the chace that next shall hear their bay!
There have been hunters, famous ones of old,
Rent by their own dogs, by a master rash
Aroused to strange wrath under too tight hold
Of leash, too savage smiting of the lash.
Kaiser for King thou art; but they that gave
Imperial robe and crown can take away;
Strength based on fraud or force still finds its grave
Dug by the hands that vied its base to lay.

EXTRAORDINARY BIRTH OF TWINS.
A contemporary thus announces:—
"A Fact for Naturalists.—A few days ago the bear at Rosherville
Gardens gave birth to two fine cubs. According to Buffon, this class, Ursw
Arcto*, rarely have more than one at a time."
It is too early to advise the Lessee of Rosherville Gardens to get
the case of extraordinary fecundity which has occurred on his pre-
mises made known to the Queen with a view to the probability that
Her Majesty would, with her accustomed liberality, be graciously
pleased to present him with a gratuity for the poor bear. It is now
two months to the First of April.
VERY HARD LATIN.
Some classical authorities, calling for a reform of our pronun-
ciation of Latin, urge that c before e, a, or i, ought to be sounded
like k, so that cicer, Casar, Cicero, should be pronounced kiker,
Kcesar, Kikero. It is not clear that c ought to be kicked out of the
Latin language in this way; such violent kicking hurts the car;
and schoolboYs will perhaps generally agree that those who want to
introduce it deserve monkey's allowance—"more kicks than half-
pence." Let persons addicted to the use of slang, in whose dialect
two-and-a-kick means half-a-crown, remark, if they please, that
they would twelve times rather have a kick than a halfpenny.

Of Pekoe and Twankay he never doth fail,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [February 4, 1871.

RUSKIN'S REMEDY FOR INUNDATION.
T dkak John, — Let's
begin at the be-
ginning. First
catch your oracle.
I have caught
two — you and
Thomas Carlyle
— and I feel I
ought to be thank-
ful. I consult you
alternately, and
go by the answers.
But the worst of
it is no oracle,
since the Pythian,
is good for all
questions. Even
it wasn't always
clear. You are
always clear, you will say, but then arc you always right? On
Old Painters and Modern, Art and Nature, Clouds and. Trees, Moun-
tains and Minerals, Ethics of the Dust and Glories of the Sky,
Crowns of Wild Olive, and Cestuses of Aglaia, and Scsamum and
Lilies, and Lamps of Architecture, and Stones of Venice, you may
be. Some of my friends tell me you are; others tell me you are
quite the reverse. But at least all you say on these matters reads
very mystical and musical, and sounds uncommonly like an oracle;
and if I can't always understand, I can always shut my eyes, and
open my cars and swallow what Ruskin sends me.
But then vou have lately insisted on starting an oracle for Political
Economy. There, as a wretched. Philistine, and low shop-keeping
scoundrel, I do seem to see a little daylight, only a little, I admit,
but, by what 1 can see, your oracles on that point are by no means
such as I can swallow. I can shut my eyes, and open my cars, but
I can't get down what you send me. In short when you come
"unto mis last" I feel you've got beyond your last: and I take it
ne tutor is one of the best old work-a-day oracles ever delivered.
But let Political Economy pass. I said I saw a little daylight
there, but I admit there are a peat many very nasty bits of thorny-
brake, and sour, quaking bog, m that wood, still, and anybody who
brings his axe, and helps to make a clearing is welcome. Only he
must come as woodman and workman, not as wiseacre and
oracle. The worst of Political Economy sums is that they have to be
worked with men's interests, principles, passions, and pockets for
factors, and these arc very difficult counters to cipher with. You
can't prove your sums, as we used to have to do at school. But when
it comes to engineering, and you proceed to give oracles on that, I'm
down on you. We are on safe and sure ground here among figures
and quantities, measures of length, liquid measures, and measures
of capacity. And I am afraid, when I bring my gauge to test your
measure of capacity as an engineering oracle, it don't "come out"
at all as it ought—for an oracle.
You have lately been teaching the Royal Institution how to
prevent inundations of the Tiber. It doesn t seem exactly our most
pressing business—but let that pass.
Hero is your remedy in your own words.*
"Every mountain farm ought to have a dyke about two feet high—with a
small ditch within it—carried at intervals in regular, scarcely perceptible
incline, across its fields;—with discharge into a reservoir largo enough to
contain a week's maximum rainfall on the area of that farm in the stormiest
weather—the higher uncultivated lands being guarded over larger spaces with
bolder embankments. No drop of water that had once touched hill ground
ought ever to reach the plains till it was wanted there: and the maintenance
of the bank and reservoir, once built, on any farm, would not cost more than
the keeping up of its cattle-sheds against chance of whirlwind and snow."
Now really, my dear Oracle! Do you know that rain has fallen
over London at the rate of four inches in the hour? That about
Rome, such falls may take place for several hours, and at not
distant intervals Y That thirty inches of rain in twenty-four hours
have been recorded at Geneva?
Why how often have you yourself noted the effects of sudden
mountain storms in Switzerland and Italy: dry ravines turned
suddenly to torrents; beds of gravel dragged over great slopes;
huge boulders whisked about, like shuttlecocks under the battle-
dore, and large areas left as bare of soil as the back of my hand.
Where would your two-foot dykes and conduits and tanks be, in
a storm like that t—As John Thomas would say, "gone to everlast-
ing smash."
Seriously, are you aware what an inch depth of rain means?
It means 22,400 gallons, or one hundred tons, of water on every
square acre of land; and supposing four inches to come down in an
hour, this means four hundred tons of water per hour per acre. And
• See letter in Fall Mall Gazelle, Jan. 19.
you talk of tanking the maximum rainfall for a week! Have you
considered that for the gathering ground that feeds Father Tiber, this
would mead storing millions of tons, thousands of millions of gallons,
each gallon weighing ten pounds, and having destructive force in
proportion to volume, and the depth and declivity of ravine dis-
charging it; that a farm of one hundred acres, to accommodate one
hour s rainfall only at the maximum London rate, would require a
tank one thousand feet long, one hundred wide, and ten deep, which,
make it as rudely and cheaply as you can, would cost many thousand
pounds; while larger reservoirs in the higher mountain gorges would
swallow up hundreds of thousands of pounds, and then might be
filled to overflowing by the rains of one week!
My dear John, I don't advise you to go into the City with a
Roman Anti-Inundation Company; or, if you do, shirk the
arithmetical, and stick to the oracular.
The truth is, old Father Tiber is suffering, like other rivers, in
Italy and elsewhere, for want of having his bed made. He has had
pitched into that bed the solid rubbish and detritus of centuries;
and I doubt if any iEdile, from the first on record to Mr. Ayrton's
latest and stingiest contemporary, has ever so much as relieved the
poor old boy of a barrowful. Dredging and embanking in the right
places—by the advice of an engineer, not an oracle—may do some-
thing to keep the yellow old Father in bounds. But till he has had
his bed properly made, and his poor old sides comfortably padded
with cunningly placed embankment cushions, he will kick over his
banks occasionally, and small blame to him.
But, that J. R. his oracle won't help him, believe me, my dear
Rr/SKIN, on the assurance of your constant reader and warm extra-
oracular admirer,
TEMPTING ARTICLES.
The Times quotes the following pleasant paragraph:—
"Breakfast Delicacies.—According to the Chemut and Drttgyut, Ameri-
cans arc manufacturing golden syrup with sulphuric acid and starch. It ia
said to blacken the teeth, and chaw up the gizzard. From the same land of
innocence wo read of currant jelly being made out of old boots."—British
Medical Journal.
This is bad enough, but there is worse to follow. The Chemist
and Druggist has not revealed half of what it might have disclosed.
We are reluctant to make those of our readers uncomfortable who
are particular about what they eat and drink, but private advices
from America speak of the following delicacies as being^ manufac-
tured in large quantities, both for home consumption and importation
into this and other epicurean countries.
Treacle from coal tar.
Anchovy paste and sauce from old fishing-tackle.
Cayenne from rusty tenpenny nails.
Preserved ginger from doormats.
Ketchup from old hats.
Isinglass from shirt-fronts.
Caviare from old Russia leather book bindings.
Sponge-cakefrom flannel garments.
Other novelties are in preparation, and will shortly be introduced
into the market.
AN AFFLICTED UNDERTAKER.
Undertakers do not, as a rule, possess much of Mr. Punch's
affections, but let that pass. He is not going to compose a homily
against extortions, or vanities. Nor, of course, is he going to be
flippant on a topic that should repel flippancy. But he has to
announce a discovery. Needless to say that the Affliction usually
manifested by the undertaker is not supposed to be very genuine.
But Mr. Punch has lighted on an Afflicted Undertaker, a real one.
From a newspaper—one of the best and ablest of our provincial con-
temporaries—he has cut an advertisement. The advertiser cannot
get his money from the representatives of some lady whose funeral
ne has performed. We have, of course, utterly altered all names.
MTIS. JACKSON, DECEASED.
JAMES JONES, Funeral Undertaker, « * * * Street, • • • would
feel obliged to the Friends or Representatives of the late Mrs. Jackson
if they would inform him who are the proper parties to pay her Funeral
Expenses.
After a detailed description of the business, which appears to have
been conducted in "a very superior manner," the advertiser bursts
out with a mixture of sorrow and sarcasm, thus:—
"James Jones is not aware that he is in any way connected with the
Jackson Family so as to entitle him to bury her and not be paid."
There! Have we said that the above appears in an Irish paper?
Was it necessary? Where but in Ireland could we expect to find
such an Anomaly as an Afflicted Undertaker? Mr. Disraeli's
Melancholy Ocean !* a wonder-worker, after all.

Waiter. "Now, then, look Sharp! Here's that Mutton-Chop a Biling

Toweeing Passion!"
PAROCHIAL BARBARITY.
At Marlborough Street Police Court, the other day'
Mb. Newton, on the application of Me. Richard Harris'
barrister, instructed by Mr. Colam, Secretary of theiRoyal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, granted
summonses against Mr. Charles Lowe, Assistant-Sur-
veyor of Marylebone, and Mr. William Green, foreman
of the works, for causing cruelty to horses. The roadway
extending from Regent Circus, Oxford Street, to Mar-
garet Street, was stated to have been repaired with gra-
nite chips six inches in depth, much larger than usual,
and laid down in a rough state, nothing having been
done to crush them so as to enable horses to cross them
without pain. This was contended to amount, under a
section of an Act of Parliament, to the offence of causing
horses to be tortured. Humane persons in general, ana
particularly those who keep valuable horses, will be glad
to know that Mr. Newton, in granting the summonses,
said he considered the case a very proper one to be tried.
In such cases, which are disgracefully numerous, there
are two questions. One of them regards the culpability
of the accused, who may or may not have had it in
their power to macadamise the parochial granite. Bumbles
are parsimonious, and steam-rollers cost money. The
other question is whether allowing granite, by neglect,
to be laid down in the state above described, is indeed a
barbarity equal to the offence of causing the torture of
horses. If it ia not, then there would be no cruelty
in paving carriage roads, as walls are fenced, with broken
bottles.
A Sad Discovery.
It is a grave accusation to bring against a great writer
and a famous poet, but we fear Wordsworth must be
charged with favouring the horrible practice of Canni-
balism, for does he not say that a Woman (a Woman,
mark ye!) is
"A creature not too bright or good
For human nature's daily food?"
Can't Be.
We read that a Burlesque had lately been enacted to
amuse the poor Idiots at Larlswood, and that they were
delighted. Surely there is some mistake.
NO WAR WITH AMERICA.
The following most important details will be read with an eager-
ness amounting to avidity.
This telegram arrived from the United States:—
"General Better has introduced, and the House of Representatives by
172 votes against 21 has passed a resolution welcoming Mr. O'Donovan
Ross a and the other recently arrived Fenians in this country."
Snatching his Waverley pen, but in no wavering mood (the wit is
Sir Walter's), Mr. Punch wrote as follows:—
To President Grant.
Own np, old hoss, and be spry. Is that message about Butler
fax? Don't snarl, my yarn. Punch.
In about five hours a messenger came in, and brought back the
above, stating that it had taken nim all that time to find the Regent's
Park, that he had delivered the document, and that the President
of the Royal Academy had returned it, with his kindest compli-
ments, as he thought that there must be some mistake.
Mr. Punch looked—only once—but it was more than enough—at
the dawdling and blundering messenger.
To make a generous settlement on nis widow, and to dispatch his
successor to the telegraph office, was the work of a moment.
This was the reply:—
To Lord Punch.
My sakes and gracious and deliverance! You don't make no
count of that bunkum? Take half a single squinny at it, and you '11
see straight. Grant.
Then came these exchanges:—
To President Grant.
I don't know what a squinny means, and I do want to know what
you mean.
Punch.
To Lord Punch.
Don't wake snakes. What we feel for you is real nice, and we
are going to send your Princess a wedding present. Grant.
To President Grant.
Snakes be scotch'd. Quite right about H.R.H. But no evasions,
old hoss. What dew that Resolution imply '< Answer right away,
as I hear the dinner-gong, and Granville dines with me—do you
understand? Punch.
To Lord Punch.
Ain't he riled? Sir. The Resolution is a Faction's bid for the
Irish Vote, which, moreover and moreunder, the Faction won't git.
Won't you respectfully ask your Monkey to come down?
Grant.
To President Grant.
When my Monkey is up he ain't easily down'd. Faction is a good
word, and so is stupefaction, in which 1 must be to regard 172 votes

To Lord Punch.
You Britishers don't understand us, and, please the pigs, you
never will. Am I the President of this hero free and enlightened
Republic, or am I not? And don't I know my own subjects-
sovereigns, I mean? Sum up that, and pass the bottle to Gran-
ville, with my sentiments of estimation. You'll spile your di-
gestion if you go on wobbling, and you ain't a young person.
Grant.
To President Grant.
Ulysses, I shall " wobble" as much as I please, and I scorn your
allusion to pigs. Granville drinks with me and thinks with me.

opposite one, lamenting that the Fenians were not spiflicated? and
promising to take an early opportunity of rectifying that error i

unworthy attempt to cajole the least respectable part of our popula-
tion, especially as it ain't no use. Mr. Thornton may walk into

is held in as much regard here as at home, and that if state exigen-

one of the towers of Windsor Castle, and Granville bids me add
that he would have dined with him three times a week. 1 shall

This uncommonly elegant extract is derived from tho Staffordshire
Advertiser. In an educational point of view it is remarkable as
presenting evidence of intelligence developed by cultivation to as
high a degree, perhaps, as it is capable of attaining. One faculty
with which the advertiser may appear to be eminently gifted is that
of self-appreciation, and there may be solicitors and others who even
think they would like to acquire him at their valuation, and dispi
of him at"'
be reallv
Sum of Money." The worship of the Golden Calf is an idolatry
which a respectable Solicitor would be incapable, but he might
nevertheless rejoice in the acquisition of a treasure which might; in

it his own. But that, as regards the property which he may
y entitled to, is truly, perhaps, as he describes it; a "Good
Money." The worship of the Golden Calf is an idolatry of
a sense, bo so denominated. Any Solicitor, respectable or otherwise,
burdened with a portionless daughter, is offered an opportunity of
becoming possibly blest with an opulent son-in-law. Solicitors'
daughters whose faces are their fortunes, would, doubtless, many of
them like to know more about the author of the foregoing advertise-
ment. It would be but natural for them to wish to have some idea
of what he is like. Not much is conveyed by his own statement that
"he is pleasant-looking rather slender a Genteel appearance ;" and
he might as well have announced that, on application, he would
send his photograph; a word which he very probably might have
contrived to write in phonetic speLling. We are sorry that we have
not been provided with the means of surmounting this notice with a
Portrait of the Gentleman whom it concerns.
A THOROUGH FRENCH GAMECOCK.
France always will be France, as long as she is led by such men
as M. Gambetta. The commencement of that Statesman's late
proclamation is the truest French possible for such an appeal:—
"Citizens! The foreigner has inflicted upon France the most cruel
injury in this accursed war, in the unmeasured chastisement of the errors and
weaknesses of a great nation."
"Errors and weaknesses." What admirable euphemisms for the
motives and miscalculations which caused the invasion of Germany'.
M. Gambetta proceeds:—
"Paris the impregnable, forced and vanquished by famine, could no longer
hold in check the German hordes. On the 28th January she succumbed-
The city remains still intact, as a last homage which has been WTested by the
power of moral grandeur from the barbarians."
These noble words make us feel ashamed of ourselves. We had no
notion that Paris was a city of any moral grandeur. On the
contrary, we always supposed its grandeur to be chiefly of an
opposite description. Again, we imagined that the soldiers of
Germany had conquered the French armies mainly by their
superiority as to the strategy and science of their commanders, and
also as well by their greater individual instruction and intelligence.
But now we learn that the conquerors of M. Gamdetta's country-
men are "German hordes," ana "barbarians." The language of
the Grand Nation, as employed by M. Gambetta is as lofty as that
of the Celestial Empire. A German Mandarin would denominate the
Germans and all the civilised world besides by the letter " I." This
may be regarded as a peculiar species of national egotism; but in
that way M. Gambetta s above-quoted address is the most magni-
ficent thing perhaps which has ever appeared out of China.

ADVERTISING VALENTINES.

As some people are lazy, even when in love, there is little doubt
that post-cards will in future be need largely in the service of Saint
Valentine. _ Few lovers now will undertake to give themselves the
trouble to indite a sonnet to their mistress's eyebrow, or indulge in
any other sentimental form of poesy. The most that young men do
in this prosaic age is to walk into a shop where Valentines are sold,
and purchase something stupid and exceedingly expensive, which
they send off by the post to the young lady they are nuts on," as
their horrible slang goes. The post-card will, however, afford? an
easy way of sending Valentines about, being specially adapted for
anonymous effusions; and, possibly, young men may take advantage
of the fact, and may be tempted to devote a score of hours or so of
leisure to the concoction of, say, half-a-dozen rhyming nonsense
verses. To fit the limited dimensions of the postal cards, couplets
and quatrains may possibly bo hammered out, after an unwontedly
protracted spell of head-work; and young ladies will be startled out
of their serene and passionless composure by receiving an attempt at
original rhyme-writing, in lieu of the stale poetry which is sent
them by the acre, as soon as the sweet season of Saint Valentine
returns.
Puffing tradesmen, doubtless, with their usual ingenuity will imi-
tate these post-cards, for neither lovers' feelings nor even lovers'
letter-boxes are safe from such insidious and merciless attacks.
Couplets setting forth the merits of Muggins's cheap crockery, or
Buoonrs's jet-blacking, will be scattered through the world in the
shape of post-card Valentines; and we can readily conceive the
mingled wrath and indignation of a sentimental person at receiving,
in the lieu of a sentimental quatrain, a scrap of prosy poesy in the
manner of the following, haply headed with the picture of a true
lover's knot, or a heart with one of Cupid's arrows stuck clean
through it, still further to keep up the temblc deception:—
r.
The rose is red, the violet blue,
. The grass is green, and so are you—
If, when your Valentine you wed.
You do not go to Brown for bread.
n.
Fair maid, were I thy Valentine,
I'd toast thee in the choicest wine:
Such the champagne at Fizzer's shop,
'Twill make shy men the question pop.
in.
Sweet Valentine, pray name the happy day,
And we forthwith to Gimcrack will away:
Gimcrack, amid a thousand useful things.
Supplies the best and cheapest wedding-rings.
IV.
Saint Valentine, thy votary bless!
Aid all fond lovers in distress:
Bid them, if they would fain look smart,
To buy their clothes at Aaron's mart.
v.
Say, wilt thou be my Valentine?
Then, sweet, at Skinner's we will dine.
For what is love without good dinners?
The choicest " spreads " are had at Skinner's.
VI.
To-morrow, to-morrow is Valentine's Day!
And Jenkins will make then his usual display
Of rugs and of wrappers, the cheapest e'er seen,
All lit for a journey to Gretna its Green!
vn.
I heard a gentle spirit sing,
"Go buy of Trash a diamond ring,
And send it to your Valentine,
'Tis ten to one she '11 then be thine."
VIII.
Love is a fire that quenchless burns,
When Valentine's great day returns:
But lovers need, like other souls,
In winter drear a fire of coals:
So, lovers, lose no time, but go'
Lay in your stock from Slate & Co.
IX.
I would I'were a humming-bird,
How prettily I'd sing!
And let my little voice be heard.
And joy to thousands bring,
By warning them that Wiggins keeps
Ot Valentines the biggest heaps.
INHUMAN TRAFFIC.
"Tin Post-Ovficb.—The new halfpenny post has necessitated a large
addition to the staff of the circulation branch of the Post-Offlce. The authori-
ties accordingly advertise for 130 boy sorters. They are to be delivered at
St. Martin's-le-Grand without delay, and are to measure not less thou 4 feet
10 inches each."
We cannot, we will not, believe for an instant, or any shorter
period of time, that the Post-Office authorities have in a public ad-
vertisement, paid for out of the taxes levied on a toiling people, so
outraged the tenderest feelings of our common humanity as to dare
to propose, with the eyes of all the sorters and stampers upon them,
that one hundred and thirty boys should be "delivered" (ours are
the mute but indignant italics) at St. Martin's-le-Grand, in the very
heart and centre of this great, prosperous, wealthy, dirty City of
London. "Delivered"! as though they were bags of letters or
sacks of newspapers, instead of intelligent, able-bodied, hungry
youths, each at least four feet ten inches in height, sons it may be
of citizens, grandsons, perchance; of freemen, of liverymen! Is
slavery about to bo introduced into this happy country, at the
request of the Postmaster-General? Is serfdom on the point of
becoming one of our cherished institutions, with the concurrence of
the Lords of the Treasury? Not even in the worst and darkest
times before the days of Wilberforce and Clarkson, not even in
Jamaica or New Orleans, could a more callous and heartless proposal
have been issued to shock the public breast, and arouse feelings of
horror and indignation in the minds of all right-thinking ratepayers.
Is this our boasted civilisation and progress? We wait impa-
tiently (at home from ten to four) for a reply, and shall not use
another halfpenny card until we have received it.
FRIGHTFUL DISSIPATION.
An Antipodean, a new Zealand " Grand Lottery," with its alluring
announcement of " All prizes and no blanks," has an inviting sound;
but an examination of the terms of tho speculation leaves in the
mind a suspicion of its desirability as an eligible investment for
their unemployed capital on the part of those who may have been
tempted to the drawing in "the Goodfellows' Hall, Waipawa."
The tickets were ten shillings each. The prizes were forty in
number. Of these, three were—"A fat bullock, valued at £10;"
"horse (broken to carry a lady), saddle and bridle;" and "a silver
hunting-watch and guard."
Of the other thirty-seven prizes, nine were " two glasses of brandy
hot and cigar," nine more " two glasses of whisky not," nine more
"two glasses of rum hot and cigar," and the remaining ten " one
glass of old English ale."
The prevalence of malt and spirituous liquors may, possibly, be
accounted for by the fact that the tickets for this great venture were
to be had " at the bar of the Empire Hotel," but we should like to
know why no cigar was allowed with the whiskey.
To the Careless.—Be cautious how you let fall a remark. It
may hurt somebody seriously.

ST. GEORGE FOR ENGLAND!
St. George's banner led the van, .
Of old in England's fight:
On English gold, for Englishman,
St. George upheld the right;
But when to fight shy we began,
We put him out of sight.
Where pluck no longer sovereign reigned,
Why should our sovereigns show
The Saint; whose sword the fight maintained,
That laid the Dragon low?
That Saint, out of John's mettle drained,
His metal ceased to know.
In vain some who the loss deplored,
St. George tried to retain;
Striving the Dragon that he floored
In trade-sense to explain,—
'Twas Poverty writhed 'neath his sword,
His sword was Trading-Gain.
They proved no dragon else he slew,
Was no Saint famed in mills,
But a bacon-factor cute, who drew,
No sword, though he drew bills;
His tale of doom—hung for a " do "—
A page of Gibbon fills.*
• See Gibbon's famous allegation that St. George, England's patron saint,
was really a Cappadocian bacon-factor in a large way. Let John Bull be
thankful that the conclusion of independent inquirers is, that Gibbon was
wrong in the party. His bacon-factor was not "our Geobqe."
Not for fame won in war's alarms,
But prowess of the purse,
We first invoked St. George's charms
To guard us from war's curse.
Sovereigns in our times ne'er bore arms;
St. George held the "reverse."
But spite of proof, your bluff John Bull
In his Saint George believed,
As Knight who of knocks a belly-full
Still thankfully received:
And 'gainst all odds out sword would pull,
So he the oppressed relieved.
Such the Saint George old England knew,
The Saint of righteous war,
Whose falchion flashed, whose banner flew,
Still under Honour's star;
Whose soldiers won at Waterloo,
His ships at Trafalgar.
The Saint who never counted odds,
When right must be upheld,
Who conquerors' claims and tyrants' nods,
Faced and their fear dispelled;
Who knowing still the good cause God's,
In his strength strove and quelled.
That is the Saint, whose image long
Has been missed off our gold:
His stamp once on our hearts was strong,
Its place there does it hold,
Still armed to face the Dragon Wrong,
As in the days of old?

Or has the spirit of the Saint
Id out hearts lost its place,'
Its flame sunk to a flicker faint
That warms nor hand nor face?
With Gain's alloy and Greed's attaint,
Has England's gold grown hase?
If so, in mockery he shows
Upon our coin once more:
Our money-makers are his foes,
His friends the fools of yore
Who in Life's game ne'er counted hlows,
So honours they could score.
"Wild dreamer! lend thy ass's ears
And learn," Bob Lowe replies—
"Saint George on sovereigns re-appears
To wondering British eyes,
.Not to preach trust in swords and spears,
But to use up the old dies."
But Vhomme propose et Dieu dispose;
Most, when 'tis Saint to Snob:
And John Bull may take part—who knows ?-
With Sovereign against Bob,
And prove his Saint s return he owes
To more than a Mint-job.
Honour with monev 'gins to strive,
Here on Tom Tiddler's ground;
The Saint in John Bull's soul's alive
Though long in coma bound j
Not for Lowe ends will he revive,
Nor but on gold be found.
But, step sedate, and soul elate,
Will face the fight once more,
As when John Bull twelve foemen's fate
On each twelve arrows bore;
When prouder soul, if poorer state,
Abroad, at home, he wore;
Will prove, where'er the Eight's at stake,
Even on the battle-plain,
Honour our Captain we can make,
Though greed call out "Refrain!
Bow the head, and the buffet take,
And pocket wrong with gain."
TOLERATION FOR THE POPE!
Noi a few Protestants, whose discretion does not exceed their zeal,
have been alarmed by Mb. Gladstone's letter to Me. Dease, ex-
pressing the opinion that Her Majesty's Government would legiti-
mately exercise any influence it might have to secure the spiritual
independence of the Pope. At a meeting of Presbyterian Ministers
at Liverpool, lately, convened to protest against that letter, two of
their number, says the Tablet, "startled the assembly from its pro-
priety by their opposition to its object." One of these reverend
gentlemen—
"The Rev. A. Bentobl, rose and said, he believed that the intention of
Mil. Gladstone was to protect this country from the machinations of petty
States, under whose power the Pope might be brought at any time. For
example, it was possible that the Kino op Italy might get the Pope under
his thumb, and then 8,000,000 of our fellow-countrymen would no longer be
under the power of the Pope, but in the power of the Kino of Italy, or
some other petty sovereign."
The Tablet quotes these remarks with gratification which is in-
telligible, and approbation in which, for once at least, it will have
the concurrence of most rational persons. But one wonders that a
leading Roman Catholic organ failed to point out, for the instruc-
tion of readers who might possibly need it, that, desirable as the
Pope's spiritual independence is, it is to be desired on other grounds
than the reason assigned by Me. Rentoul. An Infallible Head of
the Church cannot possibly be compelled to misdirect his spiritual
subjects by any the severest amount of pressure which he may be
liable to experience under the thumb of any earthly sovereign.
One More Experiment.
Feakce, it is said, will have to choose between three forms of
Government, Imperialism, Monarchy, or Republicanism. There
remains, however; a fourth conceivable regime under which she
might! and should if possible, place herself—the rule of Psychological
Medicine. That, duly enforced, might keep a noble nation, if not
quiet, harmless.
SHODDY AND SHOES.
uch excitement has
been recently created
among the minor
mercantile inhabit-
ants of Southwark,
Lambeth, and the
adjacent riverain
territory, by a para-
graph in the Echo
du Nord, 'of which
some English papers
have circulated a
translation. By ac-
count thereof:—
"The Procureur de
la Ilepublique of Lille
has arrested and lodged
in the House of Deten-
tion, M. Casper, shoe-
maker and army fur-
nisher. This person, of
English origin, has sup-
plied the in tendance of
the Third Division with
15,000 pairs of shoes,
the sole* of which arc
of pasteboard."
It is indignantly
denied, by the South
London commercial gentlemen in a limited way of business, that
any army furnisher capable of supplying troops with shoes having
pasteboard soles, could possibly be of English origin. But they
say that, aware of the prejudices with which the minds of foreigners
have probably been imbued by certain calumnious police reports,
they cannot help feeling somewhat seriously alarmed by the
concluding part of the foregoing announcement relative to M.
Casper :—

"He was arrested at the railway station just as he was about to proceed to
Calais by express train. He is also the contractor for large quantities of shoes
for the Government of Bordeaux. The acts of which fi. Casper is accused
are crimes provided against by penalties under Articles 77, 430, and 433 of the
penal code.
What are those penalties? Are they limited to fine and simple
imprisonment, or is the imprisonment aggravated by hard labour?
Can it be that such an offence as that of falsifying shoos for soldiers
renders, in France, a delinquent liable to any corporal punishment
of an afflictive and shameful character; for instance, to a whipping?
Is it even possible that, under some one or other of those articles of
the penal code, a frandulent army contractor may subject himself
to be shot? These questions disquiet, indeed, not only the retail
dealers on the Surrey side of the Thames, but also some extensive
manufacturers and men of business in other parts of London, and in
many large towns and centres of industry besides. They know that
to give a dog a bad name is to hang him, and that to call a
man accused of cheating in commodities an Englishman, is on the
Continent, in effect, to give him a bad name. Not but that M.
Caspeb might be hanged for aught they care; but they feel that
if he were, a new stain would be cast upon the honour of their
country; inasmuch as he is said to be "of English origin." They
are also decidedly of opinion that such severity, exercised on a man
convicted of a fraud essentially no worse than working up shoddy,
adulterating food, or using false weights and measures, would con-
stitute an example which might be followed by a deplorably retro-
grade movement in civilisation.
A SLIGHT CONFUSION.
When London journals detail \
they should at least show a regard for the rudiments of grammar,
and not set at naught all the traditions about genders. In the
papers of Friday, February the third, in a notice of the election of the
Bath School Board, we read that "the following were the eleven
gentlemen chosen:—Rev. Peebendaby Kemble, Rev. Canon Ber-
nard, Me. T. W. Gibbs, Mb. J. W. Moeeis, the Rev. A. Douglas,
Me. R. King, Rev. De. Sweeney, Miss Shim, Miss Ashwobth,
Rev. David Wassell, Rev. W. Sabgeant."
Will the ladies consider this a compliment or not?
Paradox: to a Physician.
You have a practice, Doctor, to be sure—
It is extensive, but a sinecure.

COMPLIMENT FROM CONGRESS.
There are working- men, and idle men whom working men you call,
With leaders, whilst their hands should ply a needle or an awl,
Who choose to exercise their tongues, and go haranguing mobs;
Thus quit, for barren politics, remunerative jobs.
The tailors and the shoemakers, with Odgek at their head,
Together with assembled Boughs, by love of mischief led,
Accustomed are to march the streets and meet in Park or Square,
And shout their indignation, menace, wishes, in the air.
Not always to mere home affairs their wisdom is confined,
Their neighbours' business too, at times, their pleasure is to mind,
They ever, on occasion, roar, with, as, it were one throat,
Demanding intervention a Republic to promote.
But loudly as they '11 greet a revolutionary chief,
From them no demonstration wins the assassin and the thief,
The incendiary, to treason who his base assistance lends;
Had any traitors borrowed it, they'd ne'er hail them as friends.
And they who follow Odger, and to Merriman- give heed,
Small part are of the People—of the Londoners, indeed;
Nay, but the smaller portion form of those industrious bands
Who work in flannel jackets, or in shirt-sleeves, with their hands.
But what are those Americans, resolved who havejto do
Honour befitting heroes to the pardoned Fenian crew?
The House of Kepresentatives, Dy gallant Butler led;
A body 0 how noble, with a not less noble head!
And do they represent, then, that great Nation of the West—
Caitiffs, with malice venomous each rankling in his breast,
Dastards, to hurl safe insult who are moved by causeless hate,
Unless its cause be envy which the Snob doth actuate?
Pooh! not they, more than, Tooley Street, thy famous Tailors three
Spoke as "The People of England" when they wrote themselves
down "We."
Their Fenian Demonstration will a mere intent denote,
Whose failure is most probable—to gain the Irish Vote.

ARCADIA.
Tills advertisement is redolent of pure conntry air,
and comes to lis in a refreshing- fashion, at this season of
leaden fog, disagreeable enough to Mr. Punch, though
pined after by his friend Dr. Russell, amid the viler fogs
of Versailles:—

: Larkin'! I

WANTED, immediately, a respectable
FARMER'S DAUGHTER, or one accustomed to a Farm-
House, to assist the mistress in the work, no girl kept, only a boy;
she would be treated as a daughter. One that can milk and play
the piano will be preferred. High salary not given, stating age,
salary, &c.—Address, A.B.C., Post Office, &c.
To be treated as a Daughter, to have no rival girl in
the regards of her mistress-mother, to milk the cow,
and to play the piano. What an enviable life! High
salary not given. We should think not. Who could
want salary in a home like this? Wc have not heard
of milk and music in such contiguity, since the days of
dear. Mrs. Fitzwilliam (not easily forgotten are that
pleasant face and sweet voice) who was wont to sing—
"To the fields I earn- my milking-pail,
On a May day morning early.
Nos etiam in Arcadia, but it was a long time ago, and
now we are told that we ought not to go even into the
Burlington Arcade, for fear of seeing unworthy folks.
But here is "Arcady again." Happy Domesticated
Farmer's Daughter!
FUNGUS AND FASHION.
After the warm rains of summer the lawn is often,
within a few hours, covered with crops of the fungus
(Lffcnperdon plumhcum) commonly caUed Puff-ball.
This globular member of the mushroom family may sug-
gest to advertising tradesmen Puff-balls of another
species. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, or anv-
one else who is solicitous for the good of trade, might
give a series of balls, at which each article of dress worn
should be ticketed with its price, and the shop at which
it was bought. These balls would be appropriately deno-
minated Puff-Balls.
AN IMPORTANT ARRIVAL.
"The War has brought to London"—not Jules Favbe, not
M. Thiers, not General Thochu, not distinguished foreign Musi-
cians and Painters—but" the Adviser of manyof the ruling Sovereigns
of Europe. Madame . Clairvoyant* and Chiromanciste, of world-
wide renown, 5, Street, Square, From one to five o'clock.
Fee from one to three guineas."
What an opportunity for all those uneasy people who are inquisi-
tive about the future, and have a guinea in their pocket to pay for
the perilous luxury of fore-knowledge'. The street will be impas-
sable from one to five o'clock. The police will have to attend to
preserve order amongst the struggling crowd, and to regulate the
throng of carriages.
There is one omission in the advertisement. The "Adviser" does
not Bpecify her Royal clients by name, or append the testimonials
she has received from them vouching for her skill. A chiropodist
would have taken care to do this. She is wise to say " ruling Sove-
reigns :" otherwise folks might have thought the Emperor Napo-
leon, the Pope of Rome, the Queen of Spain, &c, were amongst
those she had counselled, and then even English people, gullible as
they are, would hardly have swallowed her bait.
WATS AND MEANS.
The way to get a place worth having in a Dockyard, is to prove
by competition that you are unfit for it.
The way to get a piece accepted by a Manager is to let him know
that you are "chums" with all the critics.
The means whereby you may be quit of a serious relation, who is
likewise a serious nuisance, is to take him to the Derby, and send
his wife his photograph, as he appeared at Cremorne afterwards.
The way (if you are a critic) to find out whether an amateur
stage-writer is engaged on a new play, is to ask him a great favour.
The way to make your wife entrust you with a latchkey is to
tumble over the mat, and abuse it awfully whenever she sits up
for yon.
EDUCATIONAL LUXURIES.
The next generation will be well trained. Drill and gymnastic
exercises, musio, and swimming, are already proposed as very
desirable acquirements for those who come under the operation of
the new law. But this is not all. "We are in a position to state"
that it is the intention of our leading educationists gradually to
propose the following additions to the curriculum of all schools to
be established under the Act:—
Dancing. Hieroglyphics.
Etiquette. Anatomy.
Croquet. Bezique.
Logarithms. Calisthenics
Riding. and
Water-colours. Political Economy.
There are people old-fashioned enough to think that it might be
as well to give our poor neglected children only plain joints at first
—reading, writing, arithmetic, &c,—and to let thc^ entries stand
over for the present.
A TACIT AGREEMENT.
The London School Board has been hotly discussing the question,
proposed by the Rev. J. Mee, and Mr. Smithies, doubtless with
excellent intentions, that each meeting of the Board, which consists
of members who differ as to theology, should, before proceeding to
discussion, unite in prayer. It would be difficult to devise any form
of words for that purpose in which they would all agree to join.
That difficulty might be evaded by the arrangement that, on coming
together, they should, in the first place, all stand or kneel a certain
time with their faces in their hats. But this expedient would
require that the Board should be composed exclusively of gentlemen.
The simplest and perhaps the best plan would be for them simply to
sit still, in silence, for five or ten minutes. During that time the
secularists present might at least give their minds to meditation.
A School Board, with a view to efficiency, should constitute itself,
as nearly as possible, a Society of Friends.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OFFICIAL STAR-GAZING.
Me. Punch,
Up here I had fancied Scotland was a well-educated country,
one to be held up as an example to your backward Old England, along
with America, Prussia, Japan, and other carefully-instructed states;
and that every adult, nay, every laddie and lassie between the Che-
viots and Jonn-o'-Groat's House, could, when interrogated, give
you a lucid account
of the Works of Dug-
ald Stewart or
Adam Smith, recite,
without a single
mistake, long pas-
sages from the Works
of Burns, Scott, and
Ossian, and perform
wonders in decimals.
But either I am
wrong in my impres-
sion, or ignorance
and superstition — I
had heard, by the
way, that manuals
of physical geogra-
phy and political
economy had not
altogether upset this
latter influence in
the North—are not
always routed by
schoolmasters and
schoolboards; for, to
my amazement, I
read (in the Civilian)
of the appointment
of a gentleman to be
"Second Assistant-
Astrologer" in the
Royal Observatory,
Edinburgh, prefer-
ment for which I
hope he thanks his
stars.
Whether the ob-
servation of the con-
junction of the hea-
venly bodies at the
exact moment of the
birth of the infant
hope of some noble
Highland house, the
casting of nativities,
and the drawing of
horoscopes, is an
employment which
ought to receive the
sanction of Govern-
ment, and be remu-
nerated at the public
expense, I can safely
leave to the common
sense of the Chan-
cellor of the Ex-
chequer (I know
economy is in the
ascendant with him)
and the conscience
of the Lord Advo-
cate; but I think
,you will agree with
me, Mr. Punch, in
the opinion that if
the occult science of
Astrology is openly
practised at the Royal
Observatory, Edin-
burgh, the superior
intelligence of Scotland is open to a very respectful doubt.
The Man in the Moon.
P.S. It has occurred to me that official astrologers may be kept to
predict from their scrutiny of the planets whether Ministerial
measures are likely to be disastrous or not.

THE CHEAP DEFENCE OF NATIONS.
We are trying to make some little amends for not having inter-
fered in the War, and possibly protracted its horrors, by doing what
we can towards mitigating them in helping to revictual Paris. Now
we shall probably hear no more complaint of our non-intervention in
the quarrels of foreigners until the next quarrel occurs. Then the
old taunts and abuse
repeated over again.
European bellige-
rents never clamour
for the intervention
of their Continental
neighbours as they
do for ours. Austria,
Russia, Italy, Spain,
maintain neutrality
without incurring
even remonstrance.
But our aid, on de-
mand, in quelling any
disturbances abroad,
even in the United
States, appears to
have been considered
due. We seem to be
looked upon by all
nations as the Police
of the World. As
such, if they really
want us to act, they
should entrust us
with power to en-
force the Peaoe of
the World.
To that end, they
would have nothing
more to do than agree
to a general disarma-
ment, leaving Great
Britain alone to re-
main provided with
an Army and Navy,
for the purpose of
compelling interna-
tional justice, law,
and order; the ex-
pense of keeping up
our land and sea
forces to be' defrayed
by mankind at large.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVAKI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
uursday. February 9, 1871.
The Session began.
'' May we not meet
again till February,"
jirayed Mr. Punch, in
closing bis Essence on
the 10th of last August.
For there was then a
chance — and more —
thatthePREMlER might
be compiled to exer-
cise the power he had
reserv ed, and to sum-
mon the Legislature at
short notice. Kos ser-
vant Apollo. Of whom,
in his character of
Phoebus, we should
like to see a good deal
more. "Shine out, fair
Sim, till We ran buy a
glass," and it shall be
tilled and emptied to
thine honour. "Born
and educated in this
country," Punch, like
Knra George III.,
"glories in the name
of Briton," and a Bri-
ton is nothing if he is
not meteorological. It
is, however, fair to Sol
to state, that the Queen
had a hne day for the
opening ceremonial.
Her Majesty was
present. It had been
hoped that the Sove-
reign would be able to
deliver the Speech. The
Queen might have
done so, had it been of average length. But the Ministers revenged themselves for their
extraordinary silence during the recess, by composing an address containing no fewer than
Thirty-Three Paragraphs. To nobody but a Chancery lawyer could such a reading be
entrusted, and the head Chancery lawyer of all had to toil through it. Her Majesty sat on
her throne and listened, and once made a hasty movement of her fan." Mr. Punch
suspects that this was when the Chancellor came to a sentence of remarkably queer con-
struction. It was not exceptional, and Her Majesty's indulgent good-nature was, therefore,
made manifest.
Of Thirty-Three paragraphs, eight were devoted to very becoming reference to the
Wax between Germany and France, and to a hope that the Armistice would result
in a complete Accommodation.
Kino William has become Kmperor of Germany, and we have congratulated him.
We uphold the Sanctity of Treaties. (Well said, your Majesty.) And hence the Black
Sea Conference. We regret that France is not present.
A joint Commission is to endeavour to arrange the American questions.
We hope that Kino Amadeus will be a blessing to Spain.
We have failed obtaining satisfaction for the Greek murders, but shall persevere.
The anxiety caused by the Chinese murders has ceased. We hope that Parliament
will allow China to be treated in a conciliatory manner.
[//in, your 3Iajesty. Should not that Depend f
We are friends with the Sovereigns and States of the civilised world.
"I have approved of a marriage between my daughter, Princess Louise, and the
Marquis of Lorne."
[Mr. Punch, dear Madam, has shown, by a marvellously effective
Cartoon, that he also ajiproves that match.

Revenue nourishes, as does Trade, with partial drawbacks.
Then came what Mr. Punch and the Nation chiefly desired to hear:—
This is the time to turn to account, by decisive effort, the lessons of the
war. Parliament will not oitinoE the cost of a more effective and
ELASTIC SYSTE5I OF DEFENSIVE MILITARY FHErARATION.
[Loud cheers by Mr. Punch and the Nation. They shall be louder
when Mr. Cardwell shall have made a satisfactory statement
»f the Government scheme.
Notwithstanding the interest attaching to foreign affairs, we must attend to Domestic
'"ation, and specially to these points:—
: Religious Tests in all the Universities.
2. Ecclesiastical Titles.
3. Disabilities of Trades' Union*.
4. Courts of Justice and Appeal.
5. Adjustment of Local Burdens.
6. Liquor Licence Laws.
Government will introduce a Ballot-
Bill.
Scotland expects a measure on Primary
Education.
Ireland, in regard to agrarian out-
rage, behaves better than she did
last winter, but there have been
painful exceptions. A period of
political calm is desirable for her,
after the great measures of last
year, so no Irish question is to be
raised. {Sensation of intense relief.)
The last paragraph was a well-conceived
expression of patriotism and of
piety.
Her Majesty descended from Her
Throne, embraced the Princess of Wales,
shook hands with Princess Mary of Teck,
and extended her hand for the kiss of
Princess Christian. Then all departed.
When the Lords met again, the Chan-
cellor actually performed the feat of
reading the enormous Speech again.
Mr. Punch has much admiration for
gallant achievement of every kind, but
Lord Hatherley is a very valuable public
servant, and must not risk his efficiency by
this sort of thing. We are not pleased
with the Peers, who should have stopped
it, and cried " Taken as read."
The Marquis of Westminster made his
first speech in the House of Peers, and
moved the Address. He wore the uniform
of the Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry. Lord
Kosebery (whose name is also Primrose),
who wore the uniform of the Scottish.
Archers, seconded the Address. The Duke
of Richmond, for the Opposition, com-
plimented the former on his "admirable
speech," and the latter on his "conspi-
cuous manner." Mr. Punch records that
both the Cheshire Yeoman and the Scottish
Archer discharged their tasks with much
ability and grace. Hugo Lupus may be
proud of the first, and Quentin Durward
if he be an ancestor of the second (which
we have not the least reason for supposing)
may applaud the younger peer.
The Duke of Richmond had to make a
speech, and to assume a certain amount of
formal discontent with the Government.
Which he did in as civil and gentlemanly
a way as possible, and Lord Granville's
answer was about as agreeable. But, in
speaking of tho War, he said that he was
connected with both Germany and France
by close ties, had sympatliies with both,
and had displeased both by the "cordial
neutrality" which was his duty. He
stated that Lord de Grey, President of
the Council, was to sail for America that
week, accompanied by Mr. Montague
Bernard, to attend the Commission men-
tioned in the Speech. Replying to tho
Duke, about the released lenians, he in-
sisted that political offenders ought not to
be regarded as habitual criminals. To

offenders and offenders, and that with aU
tolerance for misguided enthusiasm, he
has none for armed rebellion whose parti-
sans blow up prisons.
The Address was agreed to, and Lord
Granville proposed the re-appointment
of Lord Redesdale as Chairman of Com-
mittees. We regretted to read that his

savage dog, and the Lords were glad, as

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
Fergusson, the great surgeon, gives a favourable account of his
patient.
In the Commons, Major Hamilton, in a Scottish Yeomanry
uniform, and Mr. Samuel Mohley, in what Mr. Disraeli once
called tho unaccustomed and maguificent array" of a Deputy-
Lieutenant, moved and seconded the Address. The latter, who
represents the moderate Dissenters, said that their list of grievances
would be exhausted when the Tests Bill and a Burial Bill should be
passed. Perhaps they will instruct their representatives, when these
reforms have been granted, to imitate the " 0. P." malcontents at
the close of The Row, and stretch across the House a long scroll
inscribed, " We are Satisfied." It might not be Parliamentary, but
it would be amusing, especially if Mr. Miall tried to snatch the
thing down.
Mr. Disraeli argued that the Ministers might have prevented
the "War by telling Napoleon that we should observe an Armed Neu-
trality, though perhaps L. N. would have retorted that we had no
Army or Navy to justify the declaration. He condemned the policy
of Reduction, and talked of " Harum Scarum Budgets." Touching
the Conference, he said that Russia, as usual, would get all she
wanted. The Treaty guaranteeing Rome to the Pope had been
violated. The Americans were rude to us because they knew that
they could be so with perfect safety.
The Premier believed in the good sense of the Americans. He
could not understand an Armed Neutrality. Lord Palmerston
had not thought much of Black Sea neutrality. There was no real
diminution in our Army. He was not for a rigid rule of non-
intervention. We could not isolate ourselves. In the course of his
speech he said that there had been Four or Five Millions of taxa-
tion taken off.
Mr. Lowe. "Eight Millions." .. .
Perhaps those two words were the speech of the night.
Mr. Newdegate took the first opportunity of disagreeing with
the leader of his party. {Observe that.) And the House agreed to
the Address.
Friday. Lord Eversley was made Chairman of the Lords Com-
mittees until Lord Redesdale should have recovered, and the
Royal Message about a provision for Princess Louise was delivered.
A similar message was sent to the faithful Commons, who heard
it with their hats off. There was some speaking on the Report of
the Address, Mr. Tohrens especially urging the Government to
prevent Germany from exacting Excessive Bail from France.
Ministers did not reply. Mr. Gladstone introduced the Abolition
of Tests Bill, which is the same as that of last year, and Mr. Hardy
admitted that the Lords had not decisively rejected the Bill, and he
hoped that they would duly consider it.
-ZEdlle Ayrton stated that the foundation of the New Law Courts
would be finished by the 1st of February next. "We can but add,
with Dogberry, "Save the Foundation!" The quotation is the
more exquisitely felicitous in that the JEdile is proud of the enor-
mous saving he has effected in the cost of the Building.

A VISIT TO THE OLD MASTERS.
apfy Thought.—Go and see the
Old Masters. Suggest it to
Milburd, who says he's like
Mr. Sam "Weller at Bath, and
would propose the "Young
Missises!" That's the worst
of Milburd; can't treat a
subject seriously. Boodels
has come to town, on purpose
to see the Old Masters. Last
time I saw Boodels, ever so
long ago, he was engaged to
be married. Haven t heard
from him or seen him for
ages. "Wonder if he is married.
If he is, he will think it very
neglectful of me not to ask
after his wife. If he isn't, it
might touch a tender chord.
Very awkward. "Wish he
hadn'tturned up; only, having
turned up, I '11 leave it to him,
and perhaps he'll allude to it
himself. Boodels says we'd
better lunch before we go. He
says this on the steps of my Club, where I have gone to ask for letters.
Happy Thought.—To regret to Boodels that my Club doesn't
allow strangers to come to luncheon. Absurd rule, but so it is. I
add, unguardedly, that if you lunch, my Club puts it down as
dinner. Milburd says, carelessly, "0, never mind what they call
it, as long as they give it us."
In order not to seem inhospitable or mean (only I know at my
Glub no one lunches under ten shillings a head—at least, so a
member once informed me who had tried it), I say, ""Well, old
fellows, I'll see the butler, and try to persuade him into letting us
have luncheon."
Happy Thought.—Ask them to wait in the hall while I see the
butler in the dining-room. "Here's the butler, Sir," says the hall
porter, to whom Coker (our butler) has been speaking behind the
glass screen, and I didn't see him. Should like to take Coker aside
and prepare him for his answer; or suggest it to him with a wink,
only I'd as soon dig the Archbishop of Canterbury in the ribs, and
say, "0 you sly dog!" as I would try a joke on Coker. Mil-
burd and Boodels are both listening. "Strangers," I say emphati-
cally to Coker, who stares at me stolidly, never moving a muscle.
"can't lunch here." I say this as announcing a truism to Coker.
Coker replies, "Yes, Sir, certainly. Do you wish to take luncheon
at once? .
Boodeh and Milburd. 0 yes, at once.
Myself. Something very light, I suppose.
Boodels replies that, as for himself he doesn't want more than a
snack. Now, that's just the annoying part; the "snack" (unless
I could give them bread and cheese and the Club beer for nothing,
only I can't offer them that) will oost just as much as if I'd ordered
a choice bill, three days before. Milburd says he doesn't care what he
has; cold partridge, pheasant, game-pie, anything on the side-board.
"There is game pie," says Coker, very seriously, deprecating Mrz-
bubd's levity. A soup is ready it appears. Boodels would like
soup. '' That won't be five minutes," Coker informs us, and orders it
at once. ""Well," says Milburd, if I might suggest," he puts this
knowingly; "while we're eating the soup, theymignt be doing a
sole au gratin, and, if ordered now, it would, be ready." I ask
Boodels how this will suit him, because as he professed only to want
a "snack." this would be too much. "0," says Boodels, shrug-
ging his shoulders; "I never take lunch, but if it's there, why
Happy Thought (useful for another ttme in similar circumstances.)
—To say "I never take lunchmyself," the friends, then, couldn't force
themselves and their luncheon on a man who never takes lunch him-
self. I say it now; Milburd agrees with me, that it is a bad thing,
and it appears that he too never takes luncheon, only sometimes a
mere "snack." Boodels says, "Yes," that's his way precisely;
"Only a mere snack, but never luncheon."
Here we are, three men who never take any luncheon, only
"snacks" in the middle of the day, sitting down to mock turtle
(this is the soup which happens to be ready; it was prepared, it
appears, by order, for some one who had since oounter-ordered it), sole
au gratin, game-pie—they think they can just take a mere soupcon
of game-pie—and a " finisher," as Milburd calls it, of Stilton.
Happy Thought.—-To " suppose they '11 have a light wine—we've
some capital claret"—(at fourteen shillings a dozen, and really
first-rate)—or "would they prefer beer?" Boodels doesn't care
about beer when going to see pictures. Milburd is rather afraid
of claret. They '11 leave it to me.
Happy Thought.—Some sherry to begin with. A pint. (And
they can put water to it if they^re really thirsty.) Milburd says
that punch goes as well with mock turtle as with turtle. I can't
avoid offering them punch. Boodels says not for Aim. Milburd
says 0, not on any account for him. "Well, I don't take it myself.
(So, thank goodness, there's an item off.) Milburd asks " may he
be permitted to change his mind?" 0, certainly. No sole to
follow? Not that,—but, on second thoughts, he doesn't know but
what a mere nip of punch wouldn't be a good thing, eh? I am his
host, and return, "Let's have it," in a sort of fine Old Englishman
tone. Boodels changes his mind. I change my mind. Three
punches. "We drink. Very good. Really, remarkably good. Mil-
burd, again interrogatively, puts it that just half a nip more—merely
half a nip—wouldn't be too much, eh? "By all means. Three
more punches." After this I find myself offering them champagne,
which Coker, the butler, can recommend—and a recommendation
from Coker means a hundred and twentv-six shillings a dozen,
oertain—and we have it. "Won't they dine here," Task them,
"at eight, and I '11 give 'em a "(here, I believe, I wink, to imply
what I'll give em). They regret they can't come, and Boodels says
it's past two, and we ought to go to the pictures. '1 Won't they have
a petit verre, eh?" They hesitate. I actually press it on them.
Chartreuse, eh? Yes. Three Chartreuses. Milburd would like
a oigar. Hasn't got his case. _ Order cigar-waiter with cigar-box.
The prices are labelled on the cigar department. Which can I recom-
mend? Before luncheon I should have said that the threepences
were justly prized by our Club, but after two punches, a bottle and
a half of Gum's superior old Sillery, sherry, and one Chartreuse, I
am above giving my guests anything but the large shilling ones, not
one quarter of which will they be able to smoke before reaching the
Academy.
While they are putting on their coats, Coker presents me with—
The Bill. Ahem I Two pounds seven shillings and eightpencel

This awakes me from my bacchanalian dream, and I pocket my
shilling cigar, to be smoked at leisure. Come along! to the Old
Masters.
At the Academy. We separate. Milbfrd has his plan for seeing
it; Boodels and I have each our own. Mine is to commence with
Room No. I.
Happy Thought.—No. Commence with Room VII., and work
back to No. I.
Here we are, Room VII. Number marked up over the door.
Now then.
Next Happy TJiought.—Find No. VII. in Catalogue, and there
we are. Whatever may be Boodels' or Milbcrd's plan, it can't be
better than this.
In the Catalogue there is no No. VII. I refer to the wall again.
Yes, over the door, No. VII. Refer to Catalogue. Nothing beyond
No. VL, except Lecture Room. Atmosphere of these rooms oppres-
sive. Warmed with hot air, which come9 up, I fancy, through the
gratings in the floor. Standing over one of these reminds me of the
vapour bath of Aachen. Feel my hat gradually becoming too heavy
for me. I think one ought to visit the Old Masters in the morning,
that is, before luncheon. Meeting Boodels, he says he thinks
luncheon before pictures a mistake.
I walk about, looking at the numbers of the rooms, in order to
throw some light on No. VII. not being in the Catalogue, and come
upon Milbubd. He is on a sofa, fast asleep. I jog his arm, and
begin asking him " How he can explain , but he only looks up
for an instant, smiles placidly, shakes his head, and is off again,
presently snoring. I leave him. Can't find No. VII. in the
Catalogue.
Happy Thought.—As I can't find No. VII., to go back to No. VII.
Room and look at the number on the pictures, and see where they
come in the book. Take one at hap-hazard, it is a full length recum-
bent figure on a sofa, under hanging drapery, something like Titian's
Venus, with an animal of some sort sitting in the corner. Boodels
(standing by) says he thinks it's not a dog but a bird. We differ.
He says, refer to number in book. I refer to what appears to me the
same number in Room VI. in Catalogue. I read out title:—
"376.—St. John Preaching in the Wilderness . . . Guido Eeni."
Boodels says, "It's impossible!" I agree with him at first, but on
considering the matter over, am inclined to take a larger and more
artistic view of the matter. "That," I say. pointing to the picture,
may have been Gutdo's conception of St. John in the Wilderness."
What! " cries Boodels, on a sofa, with a lap-dog, and cur-
tains! pooh!"
He insists on taking my Cataloge (Mllbitrd has got his), and is
sure that I must have got the wrong number. I deny it. He
asserts. I deny it warmly. I put my finger on the spot, and say,
"There! see for yourself, 376, St. John Preaching "I suddenly
discover that it is 276 I have been looking at in the Catalogue. I
find 376 (which is numbered down, also, in Room VI., and we are
in Room VII.), it iB—
A Venus Painter Unknown.
I say I thought it was a Venus from the first. Am glad to find I
was right. After this I sit down. We (that is, Boodels and I)
don't find the light particularly good, and the atmosphere is so
stifling that we wish we'd taken our greatcoats off. Having sat
down, I don't feel—neither of us feel—very much inclined to get up
again.
Happy Thought.—To see all the pictures we can sitting down. As
people get in the way, we can only do " the top line.
Another Happy Thought (which strikes Boodels and myself at the
same time). Do the top line.
We notice a smart policeman walking about. He never stops
before any picture, and "seems," I say to Boodels, "to care for
none of these things "—like Galileo, I am going to add, only I
think I'm wrong in the name. [Mem. To get right on this point,
as it's useful for quotation.]
Happy Thought.—The policeman belongs to the Collection of
English Masters as "o Constable." Boodels sees it, and laughs.
I laugh, too. Boodels says, thoughtfully, as if trying to recal some-
thing: "Let me see, whose was that, Sydney Smith's or Jerrold's?"
I tell him it is mine. He says he can show it me in a book. I
answer, "Indeed!" and depreciate the Jim de mot by adding,
"Well, of course, it's a very evident joke on the name." Boodels
proposes visiting No. V. I prefer sitting. He goes to No. V.
Happy Thought.—"Left, sitting."
"Legislative Misnomer.
In the Queen's Speech, Her Majesty was made to announce a
Bill "on the Licensing of Houses for the Sale of Intoxicating
Liquors." Her Ministers, if they proposed to license butchers'
shops, might as well describe them as "Shops for the Sale of
Inflammatory Food." Beer is no more correctly named from the
effect of excess in it than Beef.
SOCIETY OF FEMALE PAINTERS.

There has been established at Belleville a revolutionary Society
denominated a Rouge Club. Its colour is of so deep a crimson that
it refuses to admit M. Victor Hugo and even M. Gambetta, as of
too faint a dye, and demurred to the admission of M. Rocheeort
himself, until a patriot reminded them that Rochefoht had pro-
claimed himself a regicide. We might have a Rouge Club of another
kind at a British Belleville; any town in England abounding in
belles, of whom there arc some who, not knowing what creatures
they make themselves look like, have adopted the ridiculous and
revolting practice of painting their faces. The reputation of belong-
ing to a well-regulated Rouge Club might prevent mistakes which
are sometimes caused by appearances.
"I 'D RATHER BE A KITTEN, AND CRY 'MEW.'"
At a recent Conservative banquet, we read that Mb. H. Mew
(Mayor of Newport) said that
"He was born a Conservative, bred a Conservative; and saw no cause, as far
as be could observe at present, for altering his opinion, and he hoped he
should die a Conservative."
Of Mr. Mew's breeding we have nothing to say; probably it was
very good breeding. About the last event to which he alludes we
would say only that we trust it is as far off as his friends desire.
But his being born a Conservative was remarkable. Fancy a Baby
pledged to Protection, Bishops in Parliament, anti-Reform in Army
and Navy, and the exclusion from the emoluments of the Uni-
versities of all who decline to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles
of the Establishment! Mb. Mew may have been (as no doubt the
doctor declared was the case) the finest Baby ever seen, but he was
certainly the funniest.
Kodern Depravity.
Dr. Lyon Playf air's address, as President of the Birmingham and
Midland Institute, has been published, and an admirable discourse
it is. We are, therefore, all the more sorry to bo obliged to add,
that a highly respectable maiden lady of our acquaintance, of inde-
pendent means and scientific tastes, has been compelled to deny
herself the pleasure of reading the Doctor's paper, on account of
its objectionable title, " The Liosculation of the Arts and Sciences."
She looked into the dictionary, and found that " inosculation" meant
a most reprehensible and silly practice—one which she has done
her best to discountenance all her life long.
LA SAGE.
Mrs. Partington hopes (with Her Majesty) that all will go
well in Spain, but does not see a good omen in the placing King
Asmodeus on the throne.
The Best Magazines.—Cereals for France.

MERRIMAN'S MYRMIDONS.
In a paragraph entitled "The Volunteers and the War Office,"
a contemporary some few days since stated that '' a meeting of
Volunteers and of men lately serving as such, but who had been dis-
missed for appearing at certain assemblies in uniform, took place at
the Lamb and Flag, in Rose Street; Covent Garden, on Saturday
night." The company thus described were no doubt equally
numerous and select, but probably the reverse of numerous. The
well-affected majority of Her Majesty's subjects need hardly fear
that many Volunteers would associate with men lately serving as
such, but who had been dismissed for" unsoldierlike conduct. The
party of Odger has reason to bo afraid that the number of those
men is inconsiderable. The congress, therefore, of ex-Volunteers
■who had been dismissed, and of existing Volunteers who ought to
be dismissed, which took place on the night and at the publichouse
above-named, must have been what may be denominated a small
turn-out. That is to say, unless it was supplemented bv a large
attendance of the gentlemen of the pavement who have lately accus-
tomed themselves, on occasional pretexts, to menace the institutions,
with the connivance of the Government, of the country, by "demon-
strations" in Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square. At this gathering
however, great or little :—
"Letters of dismissal were read by one or two Volunteers, and after some
discussion a resolution was passed pledging the meeting to bring before the
Sublic and the House of Commons the unsatisfactory state of the Volunteer
ervice arising through the recent dismissals, and instructing a Committee to
make arrangements for a deputation to wait on the Secretary for War to lay
before him certain facts relating to the Volunteer Service."
It is too probable that, if the proposed deputation from the mal-
oontents above specified do wait on the Secretary for War to inform
him of their grievances, they will not receive the attention they
merit. That Right Honourable Gentleman is not legally empowered
to place them on a footing suitable to their demands and their
deserts, by causing them to be dismissed therewith from his presence
by the muscular agency of powerful men-servants. Nor, should he
consent to receive such delegates, is there much hope that he will
have been enabled to inform them that the only possible improve-
ment of the regulations at present affecting volunteers, who, in I
character as such, attend, or take part in, seditious meetings or pro- j
cessions, is that any member of a Volunteer corps convicted of so
offending, shall be drummed out of the regiment.
LULU.

In revelations fresh she's sure to school vou—
That fair Circassian, acting in this new lieu,
The plastic Lulu!

a divine, poet, doctor, scholar, and statesman, it may be convenient to a
remote posterity to know that Lulu is a marvellous lady-acrobat, of the
of the cream of Circassia, Asia, and of Circussia, Holborn.

any urging to sub-
scribe it to the fund
now being raised to
feed the starving
poor of Paris? If so, let him read, what it gladdens Punch to
quote from, an interesting letter in the Daily News:—
"The great and beautiful feature of the siege has been the absence of
crime. No murders, no robberies, but a virtue in which to me there is some-
thing pathetic. The half-lit streets are empty by half-past nine."
And all this without a policeman in the place!
"Well, cynics may sneer at Parisian frivolity; but there is some-
thing not quite frivolous in a people that for four months can keep
their roughs in order by merely moral force. How should we fare
in London were ourpoliccmen all withdrawn, and half the gas-
lamps left unlit? We fear that London's difficulty would be Bill
Slkes's opportunity, and our burglars and garotters would have a

FORTHCOMING LEGISLATION.
The Queen's Speech, having so much to say about the affairs of
foreign nations, could only mention a few of the measures relating
to our own concerns which are understood to be ready for introduc-
tion this Session.
Mr. Punch, having been favoured with a private view of some of
the more important of these Bills, hastens, while the cold weather
makes brisk exercise agreeable, to lay them before his constant
readers.
A Bill to restrict the Number of Portraits in the Annual Exhibi-
tion of the Royal Academy.
A Bill for the Establishment of a Cheerful Newspaper.
A Bill for the Introduction of Uniformity in the Length of the
Months of the Year. [This is a measure which will do away with
much uncertainty and confusion, and render unnecessary many
milliards of questions at present of annual recurrence.]
A Bill for the better Regulation of the Practice of asking Eminent
Characters for their Autographs.
A Bill for the Total Abolition of Encores, Fees, and Gratuities at
Places of Public Entertainment.
A Bill to reduce the Exorbitant Price of Oysters.
A Bill to render Women liable to Serve on Juries in Courts of
Law, on Coroners' Inquests, &c. [The principle of, this measure is,
that as women claim to share with men the privilege of the franchise,
&c, they should also be called upon to take their part in more
disagreeable duties.]
A Bill for Erecting another Opera House in London—two, one of
which has never yet been used, not appearing sufficient.
A Bill to restrain Photographers from putting Likenesses in their
Windows, against the express Wish and Injunction of the Persons
misrepresented.
of Drinking, Smoking, Snuff-taking, Scandal, Whist-playing, Sleep-
ing in either House of Parliament, and Sitting up later than
Twelve o' Clock at Night, except by a Special Licence from the
Archbishop of Canterbury.

A Bill for the Supervision, by Salaried Official Inspectors
after open Competition, of the Costume of Public Waiters.
appointed
A Bui to provide Costermongers and other Itinerant Vendors with

A Bill to subject all Young Men wearing an Eye-glass to Surgical

TOUCHING WEATHER.
The Weather was first introduced into conversation at a dinner
party at St. Swithin's.
After many weeks of frost, snow, sleet, ice, aurora borealis, chil-
blains, cutting winds, falls on the pavement, rise in the price
of coals, scarcity and rapacity of cabs and omnibuses, water bought
by the bucket, bad colds, rheumatism, and a diurnally growing
reluctance to get up and shave in the morning—one, or at the most
two unusually mildaays, causes grumbling, discontent, impatience
of winter clothing, ingratitude towards good fires, and even forget-
fulness of the extraordinary behaviour of the plumber, in not
coming the moment you (simultaneously with about sixteen other
furious householders) sent for him when the pipes burst, the night
of your wife's little dance.
(Vice versa.) After an unusually hot Summer, horror of bed-
clothes, abuse of black hats, general looseness of attire, head-gear
gracefully festooned with white handkerchiefs, abandonment to cool
drinks, "not a dry thread" on you, and incessant quotation of
Sydney Smith's aphorism about taking off your flesh and sitting in
your bones—one, or at the outside two coldish days, produces shiver-
mgs, shakings, shawls, and shrugged shoulders, longings for a fire,
thoughts of overcoats, and requisitions for another blanket.
They have no weather in the Moon—consequently little or no
conversation.
The Clerk of the Weather is of the same family as Jack Fbost,
Hoyle, Cocker, Mrs. Grundy, Mrs. Harris, Mrs. Malaprop,
and the Oldest Inhabitant. His biography yet remains to be written.
Derangement of the digestive organs, irritability of temper, family
differences, sulkiness, sleepiness, sleeplessness, suicide, shooting"
corns, shirts of indifferent colour, pains in the joints, hair out of
curl, tough mutton, and inability to fulfil an engagement to join a
slow party, are all the Weather.
The next Census returns will show how many persons were talk-
ing about the Weather on the night of Sunday the 2nd of April.
Meteorology is a most useful science; it would be still more so, if
we could rely on it always to tell us what is in the wind.
Who was the gay, witty, brilliant, volatile Frenohman that said
we had one sauce and many—weathers? Was it Talleyrand, or
Marmontel, or Anacharsis Klootz?
If there was no uncertainty about our Weather, if it was always
monotonously fine, with no fogs, no protracted absences of the sun,
no heavy showers to be caught in, no equinoctial gales, no hailstones
the size of pullets' eggs, and no east wind—what would become of
small talk! We should have to invent new openings for conversa-
tion, as they do for chess.
The Weather exhausts us, but we shall never exhaust the Weather.
Blessings on the Weather!
"CONCERNING PRINCESSES.".
Her Majesty is stated to have ordered that the mark indicative of
shortness shall be placed over the second vowel in the name of the
Princess Helena (thus, "Helena ") in the Peerages. Loyal to the
utmost, Mr. Punch takes leave to promote his Sovereign's intention
by presenting her subjects with a mnemonio rhyme, though one
W. Shakspeare has already indicated the proper accent, in the line,
"Not Hebmta, but Helena I love."
Persons are not to pronounce H.R.H.'s name as they would do in
this couplet,
." Never in England was seen a
Princess more kind than Helena,"
But as they would in this one—
"Christian declares there's a spell in a
Song, when 'tis sung by his Helena."
This duty discharged, this pleasure enjoyed, may Mr. Punch,
with the utmost respect, ask whether the Peerages ought not to make
another alteration f He reads in Debrett, and in Dod, that the
18th March, 1818, was the birthday of Princess Louisa Caroline
Alberta, in whose happiness all her Royal Mother's subjects are
rejoicing. The Court Circular has varied H.R.H.'s name to
"Louise," so that when we have come 0n the former name in the
books, we may say with the late Mr. Wordsworth,
"I met Louisa m the shade."
If the Court Circularian acts, as he doubtless doth, jussu, a second
order will probably be addressed to the editors of the invaluable

THE MASTEKS OF THE MILLION.
Wnr.x Locis Napoleon such wisdom had shown
As, firstly, at Strasbourg and then at Boulogne,
As some may remember that ere then were born,
For a hare-brained pretender men laughed him to scorn.
But when, having first, upon Satory's plain,
His soldiers with sausages bribed, and champagne,
They saw him high perched on an Emperor's throne,
They gave him great credit for brains of his own.
lie having an army his will to enforce,
They owned that he must be a great man, of coursw;
AVilh trembling and fear they awaited his nod,
And weighed his least woids as the words of a god.
But after some blunders, when, making the last,
And greatest, down headlong he came to be cast;
He seemed in their eyes, that had witnessed his fall,
To be no such very great man, after all.
'Tis Bismarck that now for a lion doth pass
With those who, not long ago, thought him an ass.
He holds Blood and Iron, they see, at command,
To work out the schemes which his genius has planned.
Whilst Iron is ductile, and Blood will obey,
So long will be Bismarck the man of his day;
Should Iron grow stubborn, Blood choose not to flow,
As Bonaparte went, Bismarck likewise may go.
Blood, spent, Iron helps to crush muscle and bone,
Commanded—but they have a will of their own.
Thy Chancellor's bidding to-day they attend—
New Cksak of Germany—" Look to the End."
THE JOURNALISM OF PEACE.
Mr. Punch,
The papers of late have been lively reading for those
readers who like sanguinary sameness. When the war is over what
matter will journalists find to replace the narratives of special cor-
respondents, and the suggestions of spontaneous ones t Horrid
murders will not occur in sufficient number, nor can anv murder, as
to its details, exceed those of the battle-field in the horrors with
which we have been regaled to repletion.
Proposals for improving the means of destroying human life will
probably go on for some time, and it may be long before we see the
end of the case "Muzzle-loaders v. Breech-loaders." It may be
expected that these will be accompanied by communications of
devices for the improved construction of gibbets and instruments of
bodilv punishment. Considering the torments wliich good citizens
have been compelled to incur in battle, people will naturally begin
to think little of inflicting any amount of pain on criminals. Accord-
ingly crimes will be made generally capital, and torture wiU be
revived. Then we shall be entertained at breakfast by controversial
letters in the newspapers, headed, "The Wheel rertut the Gallows,"
for instance, or, "Wire r. Whipcord," or "Cow-hide v. Cat o'
Nine Tails.''
Others will advocate peculiar points in the construction and
employment of the rack, the thumbscrews, the boots, the scavenger's
daughter, the branding iron, the stocks, and the pillory. The moral
effect of the War may be anticipated to be a return to the humanity
of the Middle Ages. Sir, I have the honour to be a Sign of the
Zodiac, symbolising Progress in the direction wherein Europe is at
present moving. Your obedient servant,

MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS FOR PATERFAMILIAS.
When, but a short time ago, it was our painful duty to dispel the
hopes of parents and guardians, especially Scotch parents and
fuardians, t>y breaking to them, as gently as we could, the dis-
eartening announcement that the situations in one of the g^reat
Public Departments of Scotland—"the General Register of Sasines,
and the Register of Homings, Inhibitions, &c."—had been with-
drawn from open competition, and were no longer to be reckoned
amongst those glittering prizes of the Civil Service which every
healthy, intelligent, well-conducted youth might reasonably look
f orward to winning, we little thought that it would soon, too soon,
be our still more unwelcome office to make a communication to the
public infinitely more important than the intelligence from Edin-
burgh—and that was serious enough—affecting, as it must do, a far
larger body of youthful aspirants, and causing the demolition of a
much greater number of castellated and aerial edifices—indeed, so
many, that we hardly like, in this severe weather, to think of the dis-
appointment and dismay awaiting hundreds of happy English homes.
No contemporary domestio event, not even Mb. Ayrton's recep-
tion by his constituents at the Beaumont Institution, Mile End, can
compare in importance with the notification by the Board of Inland
Revenue, through the medium of the London Gazette, without a
word of apology or explanation, without a syllable of compunction
or compassion, that ' with the concurrence" (would not "con-
nivance " be the more fitting expression ?) "of the Lords Commis-
sioners of Her Majesty's Treasury," the situation of "Junior
Stamper " is withdrawn from Schedule A. of the Order in Council
of the 4th of June, 1870, and—what is still worse—that the situation
of " Machine-boy is included in Schedule B. of the same Order.
The public attention will soon be fixed on Foreign Affairs, Army
Reform, the Licensing System, University Tests, the Ballot, the
Budget, and many other, we admit, important matters; but surely
the wrongs of those who had hoped to become "junior stampers"
and "machine-boys," by their own unaided industry and ability,
without the demoralising intervention of patronage and influence,
will not be overlooked by a generous and sympathising people, or
fail to find a powerful champion in the hour of need.

GOOD SPECULATION.
EXHIBITION, 1871.—TO BE SOLD, a first-rate GLASS SHOW-
CASE (glass all round), designed for the accommodation of a Repre-
sentative."
This ought to prove the most attractive sight in the whole Exhi-
bition. Only one thing is required to make it a perfect success.
Let the "Representative" be a Lady, young and good-looking,
and then this Show-case will never be without a crowd of people
round it, who, if they come to stare, cannot possibly do less than
remain to pay.
'Change for the Better.
In the City News of a contemporary, a few days since, there was a
remark that " As the day advanced, the resignation of M. Gambetta
was known, and the English and foreign quotations improved."
It may be imagined that among the foreign quotations, jfourir
pour ft Patrie " was changed to Vivre pour la Patrie," and that the
English included passages from Shakspeabe, for instance, such as
"Grim-visaged War hath smoothed his wrinkled front," constitu-
ting, likewise, a great improvement upon any that have been
quotable for some time.

0 Sib—Mr. Punch—Sir
It's awful to think of. I've just read the announcement in the
papers, and what England, as a free Briton's country, is coming to,
or where it's going to, is more than. I can imagine. Look here,
Sir:—
"The time fixed for the enumeration is midnight of Sunday, April the
2nd."
If they'd have said April the first, one would have seen the joke
of it at once.
"And every person there living is to be recorded"
(like Davenpobt brothers, who used to be tied up several times a
night)—
"in a schedule"
(Why as bankrupts ?)
"to be gathered in on Monday, the 3rd."
How, Sir, are our houses to be broken into at midnight on the
second of April? Will the police come with schedules and pocket-
books, almanacks, and parish registers, into one's bedrooms at twelve
o'clock Sunday night?
Isn't Sunday a day and a night of rest? Of course. But indig-
nation and indigestion choke my utterance. I am astounded.
On that night I shall double-bar my front door, and treble lock
my bedroom, and defy the Registrar-Generals and Captains and
Colonels, and all their works. I won't have my age taken at that
time of night, except under protest. Yours,

TOM TIDDLER'S 'TATURS.
The Gardens of the Hesperides are generally supposed to be
mythical; but the equivalent of them appears to exist in reality at
the Cape. Acoording to the Natal Mercury, reports from the
diamond fields lately nave been numerous and favourable, and—
"The news from the Tatur Gold Fields was also improving, and men and
machines were stated to be wanting there."
There can he no doubt that these fields yield golden fruit, con-
stituting a certain description of apples which may be named
pommes de terre. The narratives of the ancient poets respecting the
golden pippins which they relate to have been won by Hercules may
be erroneous; but there is no mistake about the produce of the
Tatur Gold Fields.

HOMAGE TO
VICTOR HUGO.
Poor Victor Hugo! A te-
legram respecting the National
Assembly at Bordeaux, the
other day, announced that:—
"On leaving the House the
Deputies were received with loud
and enthusiastic shouts of 'Vive
In Republwue!' from the crowd
outside, and M. Victoh Huoo was
the subject of a warm ovation."
From this statement it would
appear that the author of
Autre Dame was pelted by his
countrymen with eggs which
had been unnecessarily cooked.
Nobody would throw fresh
eggs at a man, especially
when food is uncommonly
scarce, and it is wholly impro-
bable that M. Victor Hugo
had omelets, sweet or savoury,
cast at him. His ovation must
have been an unsavoury one,
indicted with addled eggs;
and is that the reward which
he has received for his pa-
triotism?

ANTI-PHOTOGRAPH DEMONSTRATION.
A Meeting of the Government Intimidation Society was held last
night at the Donkey's Head, to concert measures for expressing the
indignation of the People at the tyranny practised, on'convicts, in
prisons at Liverpool and elsewhere in compelling them to sit for
their photographs. The chair was occupied t>y Mr. Slackjaw, who
announced liimself as a representative of the Working Man. He
was not a thief, but advocated equalisation of property, and sympa-
thised with his fellows. Prison authorities had no right to photo-
graph a man who had not been sentenced to undergo that process,
which was a gross indignity. The People must assemble in their
thousands, and tell their tyrannical Rulers that they would not
stand it.
Mr. Ruffles, an habitual criminal, said that he had his self been
photographed in gaol. But he had done the beggars. He had
shammed conwersion, pretendin' to he apenitent thief, and pulled a
mug accordingly whilst he was took. He didn't much fear ne'd he
knowed if he was lagged again. He was a man of few words, and
so, to conclude, would move a resolution that this here meetin' take
immejate steps to 'old a demonstration in Trafalgar Square, with a
view to overawe the Ome Office, and demand perfection of coves in
quod from bein' photographed agin their will.
The resolution, having Deen seconded by another thief, was then
put from the Chair, and carried by acclamation. Although the
photographic grievances may seem exclusively a thieves' question,
the demonstration against it, about to come off in Trafalgar Square,
is not expected to differ, as to those who will take part therein, from
other customary displays of menace in respectability.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

Monday, Feb. 13.—On the reception of the Royal Acknowledgment of the
Address, Lokd Oranmore made occasion to express, with the utmost respect,
his conviction that the people would be gratified, if the Queen would appear
among them more frequently.
Mb. Gladstone, in a long speech, proposed, and Mr. Disraeli, with a gesture,
seconded the proposal for granting £30,000 as dowry to Princess Louise, and
£0000 as H.K.H.'s annuity. There was loud acclamation from all parts of the
House, and when Mr. Peter Taylor rose, hat in hand, to oppose the grant, the
resolution had been carried. Here it may be convenient to add that, at a i
later stage, Mr. Taylor, rising amid groans from all sides, opposed the I
grant, and Sir Robert Peel expressed regret that a Princess had, by <
the advice of Ministers, been allowed to contract herself to the son of a
Minister. Mr. Disraeli, as might be expected, treated the matter in a much
more graceful way, paid a pleasant compliment to the M arquis of Lorne, and
was glad that a Princess had accepted a Member of the House of Commons.
Mr. Gladstone corrected Sir Robert, saying that deviation from the esta-
blished rule of Royal marriage had been advised upon about eighteen months
ago, and long before the engagement to the Marquis. The division was the
most amusing which Mr. Punch has ever chronicled. There were, for the
Grant, 350; against it, 1. This unit was Mr. Fawcett, but there were really
Three against the grant, namely himself, and two Tellers, Sir Charles Dilke.
and Mr. Peter Taylor. The Commons roared lustily, and the nation echoed
the roar.
A Scotch Education Bill was introduced, as was also a Bill for the Regulation
of Children's work in Mines (into which no boy is to enter until he attains the
ripe age of Ten), and a Committee was appointed to inquire into the operation
of the Vaccination Act. As there is a private Committee just now sitting on
the same subject in nearly every family in the laud, it is a pity that there
should not be a fusion.
The Commons paid high compliment to Sir Denis le Marciiant, on his
resigning the Clerkship of the House, which he has served with the greatest
ability for many years. Heraldically speaking, Mr. Punch supposes that the
excellent officer in question is happier "nut reliant" out of the House than
regardant that eternal old clock.
Tuesday. Mr. Punch, whose eye fixes everything, mentioned in his Essence
last week that on the first night's debate Mr. Gladstone had stated that Lord
Palmerston had not thought much of the Neutralisation of the Black Sea. He
also attributed similar sentiments to Lord Clarendon.
To-night, in reply to Lord Cairns, Lord Granville was obliged to own that,
as regards Lord Clarendon, Mr. Gladstone had been misled, and that, as
regards Lord Palmerston, such off-hand remarks of his as can be remembered
appear to have little weight. Lord Palmerston is represented to have said
that the stipulations for the neutralisation could not last long—might last his
time, and so forth.
But itis quite certain, first, that the Judicious Bottleholder (as he was named
:h, O Rising Generation! from a phrase used by his Lordship about
iicious bottle-holding"—the bottle, O Rising Generation f being
an image borrowed from the usages of the now defunct
Prize Ring) would not have allowed any nation to
Violate a Treaty to which England was party, for
Palmmbston made much of treaties.
Seoondly, and this is the point. "While a Conference
was sitting to discuss a Treaty, the " Judicious" would
certainly not have played into the hands of the antago-
nists of England by citing the supposed opinions of
English statesmen in support of the cause of those an-
tagonists. Mr. Gladstone thought proper to adopt this
plan of most Injudicious Bottleholding) the Bottleholder's
art being to refresh, console, and support his own man,
not the other), and Mr. Punch's supernatural eye beheld
a Vision of the Night, and lie hath engraven the same, as
a hint to his friend the Premier. ( Vide Cartoon.)
The Home Secretary brought in a Bill for amending
the Laws of Trades' Unions. They are reeognised, their
legal disabilities are done away, but, on the other hand.
Intimidation and Molestation are made crimes. As Mr.
Huuhes and Mr. Mundklla thanked the Government,
it may be supposed that the Bill is acceptable to all par-
ties concerned. And the Attorney-General brought in
a Bill for repealing the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, and
Mr. Nkwdegatk, normally discontent with the plan,
declared it abnormally inopportune.
Wednesday. Again came up the Bill fur enabling a
man to Marry the Sister of his Departed Wife. Mr.
Thomas Chambers observed that the Commons h;ul
divided Forty tinics on the question, and had as often
affirmed that such marriage ought to be lawful. Relying
on Mr. Chambers' accuracy, Mr. Punch declines sayiir.'
more than that the Second Reading was carried by 125
to 85.
Yes, one word more. It was cleverly said in an
article in the Times, that if the Bill became an Act, it
would have the efiV-ot of "suifgestiug" a sister-in-law
as a man's second choice. Against this disadvantage
may be set what Lord Palmerston pointed out as the
humane feature of the Bill, namely, that it would
Srevent many men from having two mothers-in-law.
>ut if it is to pass, there ought to be an understanding
in families, where there are several sisters, that a man
who takes one, and does not tuke another, means nothing
rude by not accepting the Suggestion of the Act.
Thursday. The Lords had an acrid Admiralty debate,
to which the Duke of Somerset contributed a peculiarly
acrid but able speech, and His Graoe obtained a Com-
mittee of Inquiry into recent changes. Lord Halifax
wanted the motion postponed because of Mr. Childers's
absence, but the Duke said that other people had feel-
ings besides Mr. Childers, and, " having friends at the
Admiralty," the Duke "meant to stand by them."
jEdile Ayrton complained of "ridiculous criticism
on him, in reference to the New Post-Office, which had
been designed by Mr. Layard and Mr. Fergtisson,"
and added—to the satisfaction of all who really under-
stand architecture—that the latter gentleman had just
been recommended for the Gold Medal, by the Institute
of Architects. One to the j^Cdile.
Mr. Secretary Cardwell presented the Government
Scheme for the Re-organisation of the British Army—
the one important measure for which the British Nation
was impatient.
These are the principal features of the Scheme :—
It is troposed to unite all the forces or the
country into one defensive army, the
whole to be under the command of general
officers of districts, subordinate to one
commander-in-chief, and all to be under
the supreme control of the government.
The Horse Guards move into the War Office-
Lords Lieutenant arc no longer to grant Commissions
in the Auxiliary forces. That is to be done by
the Queen.
Places of training are to be established.
Staff Colonels are to look after the Auxiliaries.
The Volunteers are taken in hand by the authori-
ties. No more playing at soldiers; every man
must learn to be a rifle shot, and every man must
attend regularly. The officers are to be in-
structed, so that they may be really officers.
The Volunteers will often be brigaded with the
Regulars, and at such times will be under the
same discipline as the Army. They are calcu-
lated at 170,000.

said that this country was humiliated, and he was severe upon the
frequent use of the word "Ventured" (to suggest, Ac), in our
despatches. Sir Henry Bri/WKR and others considered the motion
ill-timed. Mr. Gladstone said that deferential language was use-
ful in public as in private transactions, defended the Government,
and thought that an extorted peace wonld be unfortunate, and that
the more magnanimity shown by the Germans after their splendid
victories, the better for France, Europe, and indeed Germany her-
self. Neither side desired interference. The motion was withdrawn.

once exercised by the

usages of modern

back through the Re-
f ormation.the Revival

to the outbreak of the

compositions of the
greatest blind poet
the world has ever
seen—the gifted and
talented Homer.
Few of those who sit down in the lap of luxury and the bosom of
their family to their annual indulgence in that composition of eggs,
flour, and milk, fried in the melted fat of swine, which at this par-
ticular season of the calendar is consumed in enormous quantities
wherever cookery has planted its standard, and the art of working
in metal is firmly rooted, give a moment's thought, as they court
the stimulus of the genial orange or seek the test of its more acid
connection, the pulpy lemon, to the sobering reflection that in their
tempting Pan-cake, they may recognise, if they possess sufficient
classical acumen and acquaintance with the productions of the
Benedictine Friars, the very same delicacy that the Greeks and
Romans introduced into their festivals held in honour of the least
prepossessing of all the heathen divinities, the god Pan.
It remains to be added that a still higher antiquity than the
Lycaca of the Greeks and the Lupercalia of the Romans has been
claimed for this popular article of consumption and commerce;
many of the greatest scholars, both of ancient and modern times,
headed by the Corporation of London in their official robes, being of
opinion that the savoury cooked food mentioned in one of the long-lost
books of Aulus Jelltus, as having sharcdwith ambrosia, and nectar,
and pickled walnuts, the distinction of always forming a part of the
entertainments given by the gods on Mount Helicon, was no other
than the unctuous and indigestible Pan-cake of modern cookery-books.

the Third Act, it may be doubtful whether the superb Artist is justified in
this supreme onslaught upon our emotions. It is fearful.
OTHELLO.— 710. Row at Brabantio's. 7 15. Fight. 7 30. Grand
harangue. 8-5. "Drown cats." 8-25. logo chaffs Desdemona. 840.
Tipsy chant. 8-45. Tipsy fight. 9 o. Green-eyed Monster. 9 25. "Wheie's
my handkerchief?" 10. Row with Desdemona. 10-20. "Willow, willow."
10-45. Stabbing, smothering, suicide, and SSlinkspearian triumph.
OTHELLO.—" The Poor Soul sat sighing." Any one would he re"
warded for " walking barefoot from Palestine" by hearing Mrs. Siddon8
warble this exquisite ditty. The audience would applaud, but are drowned
in tears. The Song may be had at the Box-Office, price Two Shillings plain,
Three Shillings coloured, with the signature " Sarah Siddons."
OTHELLO.—Covent Garden Theatre can be reached without the
slightest difficulty. Plenty of hackney-eoaches to be had at all hours,
and a table of your Jarvey's fares is hung up in the entrance hall.
OTHELLO.—" What shall we say of Mrs. Lichfield as Emilia?
Simply that so perfect a personation of a very difficult character has
never been set before a British Public. Power, force, strength, might, zeal,
contrasted with archness, softness, kindness, gentleness, tenderness, and yet
all artistically blended into an alternation of exalted heroism and womanly
devotion. How G. F. Cooke brings himself even to seem to wound her, passes
our imagination."

And followed the P. R. ring,

The fancy thought the thing.
And holding of the bottle, Bill—
This let me whisper you—
With winning of the fight, Bill,
Has a plaguy deal to do.
You've got to nurse your man, Bill,
Keep him in heart and wind,
To see he don't waste strength, Bill,
Lose temper, or go blind.
To play your own game dark, Bill,
See through the other side's,
And to keep your pecker up, Bill,

And if your man gets weak, Bill,
Or shaky on his pegs.
You've to see and not let him sneak, Bill,
"With his tail between his legs,
But take care he comes up smiling,
And clean as a new pin.
Its half-way to winning a fight, Bill,
To look as if you'd win.
And don't be too free o' your chaff, Bill,
But keep your red rag still,
You've too much o' the gab by half, Bill,
For the foreman in a mill.
Above all, never pass remarks, Bill,
On parties as isn't by:
Or say what they thought or felt. Bill,
Who says what he thinks? Did IF
And when you talk about fights, Bill,
As I held the bottle through,
Be careful you do it to rights, Bill,
And mind who you 're taLking to.
I may have said foolish things, Bill,
As who hasn't now and then?
But I don't see what's your call, Bill,
To be diggen 'em up again.
There's the party you've got in tow, Bill,
The Koosian Pet, I mean,
His backers I ought to know, Bill.
They 're anything but green.
I bottle held agin 'em
In the fight with their old Pet, Nick,
And you know if we didn't lick him,
Though he took a deal to lick.
Then you called me a quarrelsome cuss, Bill,
But now you 're on tie floor,
A-holden' the bottle for us, Bill,
Gin the Koosian Pet once more.
Just you take a word of advice, Bill,
From me as that party knows.
The less do you show the white feather, Bill,1
The louder that party crows.
He's used to the game o' brag, Bill,
And believes in look in' big,
But the stiffer you stand up to him,
The less he'll come that rig.

[At this exquisitely humorous idea both smile.
Insouciant Gentleman from Club (enters during overture and re-
cognises an acquaintance in Stall behind him). How do? (Pause.)
Any news to-night?
Acquaintance (wondering why on earth he should be asked this).
No, nothing particular.
[By which he means that he hasn't seen any of the evening
papers.
Large Middle-aged Lady (superbly attired, sees distinguished friends
in private box, and inwardly wishes that distinguished friends would
see her; nudges her husband.) There are the Grigsons. (Husband
looks up at the Gbiosons, and prepares to nod.) I wonder who's with
them?
Miss Grigson (in private box, sees their friends below, and whispers
her mother). Don't look down, Mamma,' there are those Smith-
kxnses, and if they meet us here we must ask them for next Tuesday.
[ They both carefully look the other way during the performance,
and take care to leave while the Smithkinses are intent on
the stage.
The piece commences. Beautiful dresses, and the whole thing ex-
cellently well put on the stage.
Musical Amateur (critically). It's called an Opirabouffe. There's
precious little music in it.
His Companion. Herve's isn't it? Ah! not up to ChilpSric, or
Le Petit Faust.
Well-informed Musical Amateur. And nowhere near La Grande
Duchesse. [Which is the only Optra bouffe he knows.
His Companion (correcting him). That was Offenbach's.
Well-informed One (not in the least disconcerted). Of course.
Elderly Gentleman (who has bought the books, in order to follow
the words closely). I can't make out where they are. (Mb. Toole has
been on the stage for some time, talking. Elderly Gentleman continues
in despair) I've been turning over the pages, and I can't find any-
thing he's saying.
[Great rustling of books. People trying to find out what Mb.
Toole's talking abdut, but " Yet they are not happy."
Purchasers of Books (all over the house shutting them up). It's
no good.
[They devote themselves to listening. Me. Toole continues his
Japanese Entertainment—roars of laughter.
Mr. Toole (to audience). You'll excuse my taking off my glove.
[More roars. This is repeated something under fifty times, and
is laughed at more and more.
Mr. Toole's next Witticism. I know that, &c, &c.—(anything that
comes into his head)—and yet I am not happy.
[Convulsions of laughter.
Mr. Toole. Waggery baggery wum pum Shoreditch howareyou-
to-morrow up a choopchey please remember the grotto wally-
mauwoky Bismarck, and two pennuth of puts by balloon post

[Shouts of laughter. Further search in the books, after which
they are closed and pocketed, and any attempt at ascertaining
what it said, except by listening to it (ana the theatre is not
a place in which to read but to hear a play) is given up.
Mr. Toole (appearing in a private box). Here I am—yet I am not
happy. (Comes out with a vague pun, apropos of nothing in par-
ticular) I know what one will do, now you'll see what Two'11
(Toole) do. Excuse me taking off my glove. Yet I am not happy.
Excuse me taking off my glove—yet I am not happy, &c., &c, ad
libitum.
Then some wonderful tumbling by Messes. Dauban and Ward.
Everybody unanimously pleased with Mb. Toole's Entertainment
entitled " Aladdin the Second, or a Nicht wi' Toole."
Swell (coming out). Why's it called Aladdin the Second f
His Friend (coming out stronger). Because it's Toole the first,
and Aladdin afterwards. But (quotes) "Yet I am not happy."
[Exeunt Omnes.
A propos of Theatres generally, the new Court Theatre (in which
Court it is we have not yet been able to ascertain) issues a novel kind
of play-bill. It is in four pages, which are three too many, and on
the first is a Red Lion guarding an almanack. Red Lion Court is,
we fancy, in the Strand, so this figure is evidently not intended to
symbolise the locality. The two middle pages give the programme
which commences with Turn him Out (when you've only just taken
your seat) is continued with Randall's Thumb (the four fingers being
thrown in, probably after the fashion described by the sexton in one
of the Ingoldsby Legends) and ends with It '% all a Mistake, which
last will not be, we hope, the summing up of either the audience or
the highly enterprising management. But the second page of the
programme is its gem. It proposes to place before the reader the
Distances for Hackney Carriages" from the Royal Court Theatre
to various places (or vice versa) which are carefully catalogued under
the headings of 1, Churches; 2, Exhibitions; 3, Newspaper Offices;
4, Railways; and 5, Theatres.
To commence with No. 1. Nothing is more likely than that the
greater part of every audience is either going to or coming from a
Church. So far, so good. But how far? Let us take up the first
Church which the pious gentleman who drew up the Court pro-
gramme has placed on his list. It is—
"Clapham Common—The Plough (over fauxhall Bridge)."
There may be a Plough Church, but it sounds uncommonly like a
tavern. Let us take Church No. 2:—
"Covent Garden, Great Russell Street."
There is a church in Covent Garden, and there maybe one in
Great Russell Street, but the first is not called Covent Garden
Church (perhaps he was thinking of the choristers at Evans's) nor
is the latter, if it exists, known as Great Russell Street Church.
The Third Church named in our Court Theatre Guide is—
"CEEMOKNE GARDENS, KING'S EOAD."
Ah, yes, Incumbent the Rev. E. T. Smith, pew-openers by a
corps de ballet, Clerk Mb. Friend, Beadle by M. Milano.
After this it will not surprise any one (though we pity the country
cousin on his first visit to town falling in with the Court Theatre
programme and general guide) to be informed that under the head
of Exhibitions"'—we again quote verbatim—are included
"Hammersmith—North End Road,
"Hyde Park Corner—The Lamp Post."
What a charming Exhibition, and how inexpensive—"The Lamp
Post at Hyde Park Corner." No Paterfamilias should neglect to
take his children to see this exciting spectacle. The other exhibi-
tions, though, of course, not equalling in attractiveness the afore-
said Lamp Post, are very well in their way, and arc—
"Kennington Gate (over Vauxhall Bridge)."
"Leicester Square." (.'! !)
"Maida Hill—Aberdeen Place" (.'.')
Under " Railways" Temple Bar is given, and under " Theatres,"
is placed " Whitehall, Horse Guards." This last is perhaps satirical.
The Programme, as it lies before us now, issued on the first night of
the Court Theatre's career, is well worth preserving.

When glad for bread, and that bad bread,
En queue she dresses daily,
And on the shortest commons fed,
Admits their rationale,
Till the Proud City, cynosure
Of Earth's civilisation,
Suddenly stands aghast, a-stare
In the face of Starvation—
Up jumps John Bull, with Lor'-Maire power,
Out the stored sovereigns.rattle,
And in the trucks pour meat and flour,
And corn and coals and cattle—
Still, spite of all that you have- done
To make both pain and need less.
For soldiers rotting in their wounds,
For peasants starving seedless,
For Paris 'gainst sharp famine'* coil
Swift strengthened by yotrr guineas,
Who dares say that your bounty vile
—Shop-keepers!—worth a pin is?
Your charitable feeling!—Staff!
Say your long-headed cunning.
That keeps the neutral six-foot line,
Clear of both war-train* running.
When rolling-stock comes to ft crash,
You make, mend, sell, and ntcce us;
And whosoever goes to smash,
You still pick up the piece*!
Neutral indeed! Humbugs, that blow
Still hot and cold together;
Muddy as your own porter-beer,
And dull as your own weather.
Now 'gainst the French you talk and write,
Descant, anon, 'gainst German;
And on our wickedness that fight
Drone your self-righteous sermon.
With whites of eyes that whiter grow,
And nose-twang ever louder,
The more converted guns you sell,
And segment-shells, ana powder.
For each pound profit, 'twill not hurt
To give a penny charity;
While you pile up the yellow dirt,
And groan o'er our barbarity.
Rich John!—Poor John !—in money rich,
But poor in pluck and pride too;
To Honour dead, 'tis Mammon's sun
You turn a sentient side to.
Inpockct who has head and heart,
Will also have his hands there,
While, with back dull to insult's smart,
A snubbing-block he stands there".
Give him hard words for his hard cash:
Huckster and humbug dub him;
Abuse him roundly,—one step more,

That was when he was poor:
Since then in business he s had luck,
And so fights shy—and sure.

the Dynasty. His Majesty has waited long for the
crown—but " the world is to him who knows how to
wait"—and to work. The new Sovereign's health in a

EXCITING.
The following notice has been issued, and ere this appears the event may
have come off:—
"The Police and Vaccination.—All the members of the Metropolitan Police Foroe
are to be vaccinated at once."
This is a really healthy mode of dealing with an arm of the Civil Executive.
We trust that the Police will be mustered in full force in Hyde Park, and that
no solemnity will be wanting to render the ceremony thoroughly impressive. If
not too late, we would suggest the presence of the Police Band, to play
"Uprouse ye then, my merry, merry men, for 'tis our opening day." The
thieves' proverb for the occasion will probably be " The Police vaccination is
the Roughs' opportunity." But, by the way, how will they "all" be done
"at once "? By electricity? If so, Hyde Park by all means. Field and battery
review, with cows in the distance, gazing placidly on the scene. Aux amies,
citoyens.' Lancets to the front! and be our war-cry on that day, Vaccination
and Victory!
A CLERICAL ENCOURAGEMENT.
Wild horses should not draw us into the admission that the Sooteh are
not the very pleasantest of people. Yet possibly a child might venture to think
otherwise, at least after any such experience as the following:—
"At a children's soiree, held in a village in the county of Kincardine, the other night
a clergyman, addressing nearly 300 young people, checked the exuberance of their youthful
spirits by forbidding them to applaud, telling them 'there would be nothing of that kind,
and no laughter, in heaven,' and that these manifestations of feeling were 'inconsistent
with religion.'"—Dundee Advertiser.
The Scottish clergy may be supposed to know their own people better than we
do. But it would not occur, we think, to an English parson, that a statement
j like that the reverend Soot is said to have made (the allegation about him may
be as unfounded as that attributed te him) was a very ready means of creating
a desire, on the part of children, for the locality to which they are destined.

"WHIST, WHIST, 0 WHIST!"
Mr. Punch, Sib,
Public attention having been lately much at-
tracted to the Game of Whist, you will, perhaps, allow
me to supplement the article in the Quarterly by six
folden rules, which beginners will find very usefu1.
'hey were drawn up by a late Prelate of the Irish
Church, and have been habitually practised by myself
and my friends, with gTeat success. Believe me, yours
faithfully, Tenace.
1. If your Partner leads the King of a Suit, of which
you have the Ace single, play it, and at once lead from
another suit.
2. Having only two small trumps, say the seven and
five, all the other cards being exhausted, either lead
trumps or rough.
3. Should your Partner on your first lead of trumps
drop a card of another suit, and on your second lead play
a trump, keep silent, and mix up the tricks as quickly as
possible after the hand is played out. Should your
adversaries adopt this style of play, point it out.
4. Should you happen to see your adversaries' cards,
adopt the dummy game, leading through the strong and
up to the weak hand.
5. If your Partner should deal out of his turn, say
nothing about it, but try and obtain the next deal.
6. With four honours and ten, nine, and eight of
trumps in your hand, you generally win the trick and
the game, if you do not forget to count honours. Quart
major makes a pint.
A MEAN ADVANTAGE.
A Sport always in Season.—Tuft-hunting.
Artless Woman. Henry, dear, I want to go a little
farther, to do some shopping. Let us take a cab.
Wretch. Yes, my love, and pick out one with a nice
respectable-looking driver, who we are quite sure hasn't
just been carrying any patient to the Smallpox Hospital.
Artless Woman. 0, what a horrid idea! Ugh!
It never occurred to me. Rather than run such a risk as
that, I would walk, if it was ever so.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
onday, February 20. The
Bishop of Winchester
promoted a Bill for allow-
ing aged or inlirm Parsons
to retire on a moderate
pension, deducted from the
income of the benefice. Da.
Wilberfobce advocated
the measure with his usual
ability. Lord Rom illy
opposed it, considering that
it would work hardly as
regarded aged clergymen,
and unfairly towards the
patron. But Lord Salis-
bury explained that it
would not work at all unless
the clergyman himself set
it going, and even Lord
Cairns thought the patron
sufficiently protected. Head
a Second Time.
Captain Stacpoole
asked Mr. Gladstone who-
ther Government would not
propose to Parliament to
give the Queen a Palace in
Ireland. The Premier
could not return a definite
answer, but said that the question had been for some time "in
the view" of the Cabinet. It may be as well to bracket, with this
intimation, another. The Irish Secretary asks for a Select Committee
to inquire into the state of a portion of Ireland, and feels obliged
to demand that this Committee should be Secret. That is, Irish
witnesses would be afraid to speak the truth openly. These facts
being prosaic, you shall have another, which is not. At the Galway
election a priest sent for soap, a towel, and a basin, and, in token of
his repudiation of the proceedings, vehemently washed his hands
before the people. Everybody was amused, except those who stood
near his reverence, whose name is Conway. For he splashed them
mightily, and they
"Frowned 'under' Conway's foaming flood."
The University Tests Bill in Committee. Incidents worth note
occurred. Mr. Stevenson proposed that Degrees in Divinity should
be obtained without subscription to formula, that is, that the Divine
should not be asked what sort of divinity he believed in, but only
how much divinity he knew. Fight, and Mr. Gladstone victorious
by the aid of the Conservatives—numbers 185 to 140—majority,
observe, 45. Significant cheering from the trans-gangway men on
the Liberal side. Then Mr. Fawcett proposed that the taking of
Holy Orders should not be a condition of being elected to office in
the Universities. Fight, and again Mr. Gladstone victorious by
the aid of the Conservatives—numbers 182 to 160—majority, observe,
only 22. Still more significant cheering from trans-gangway men.
Mr. Fawcett then pointed out how these triumphs had been ob-
tained, and bade Mr. Gladstone Ponder. The Premier said that
ho had pondered, and that the decision of the Government was irre-
vocable. Mr. Cavendish Bentlnck moved that where a donor or
founder had declared that an office should be held only by a Church-
man, the will of that benefactor should be respected, but Mr. Glad-
stone declined to see this. The Bill has passed the Commons.
Then, by Mr. Forster, was the enactment of Vote by Ballot
introduced as a Government measure.
We hasten to denounce the Scheme. First, it is un-English. For
the word Ballot is derived from the French word Ballotte. But that
is not all. Ballotte means a Ball used in voting. Therefore,
Secondly, the ballot is a falsity. No ball is to be used. The people
are not allowed suffragia per sph&rulis mittere—there is no ballota-
tion. The vote is to be given on a piece of paper.
These objections are stronger than any which were advanced in
answer to Mr. Forster. But stop, we have not explained his plan.
Ballot is to be used both in Parliamentary and Municipal
Elections.
Voting paper to be an official paper.
Not to be given to the Voter till no enters booth.
No mark to be made on it, except what indicates the way he
votes.
No signature.
[ You think this surplusage, do you f The head of a
most eminent firm of solicitors signed a voting paper
for the School Board Ballot.
Personation to be punished as Treating is.
Candidate, whose agents procure personation, loses seat.
No Scrutiny.
No Committees in Public-houses.
No Nomination, and I • vie it „ i
No Declaration of Poll { m Pubhc- Hooray!
Expenses of Hustings to be paid by Constituency.
There! So a man may vote as Secretly as he likes. But there is no
clause against his roaring down the street (like Tom, son of the
Piper) the name of his candidate—no hindrance to his coming out
shouting that he has voted for Brown and Jones—no punishment
in case that statement is false. The enemies of the measure are
terribly afraid that a married .voter will devote months to the inven-
tion of a deep and dark scheme for deceiving his wife as to his vote,
and that misery will be caused in a family by reason of the wife's
having suspected that her lord, talking blue, went rod. Mr. Punch,
himself married, went red at the idea that such duplicity could
enter into any one's imagination. Mr. Hope expressed his convic-
tion that the Attorney-mind of England would find some way to
defeat the object of the Bill. Bead a First Time.
Tuesday. In a discussion in the Lords, Earl Grey made a
severely just remark upon the excessive carelessness with which our
laws are drawn up. He was right. There was once an oath enacted,
and it was called the Et Cetera oath, because the taker was bidden
to swear that so-and-so, SfC, were true.
Lord Oranmore above, and Mr. Johnstone below, bothered again
about Mr. Gladstone's very proper letter about the Pope. We
wish that nobody would make any answer to such botheration. By
the way, our opinion of His Holiness, always high, has been raised
by an interesting letter in the Telegraphy one of whose correspon-
dents, an Englishman, has had an interview with the Holy Father.
The Pope held out his hand, and on its being explained that the
Englishman, introduced as an artist, was an author, Prus said, in
choice Italian:—" There are artists in words as well as in
colours. Soon was a painter, and Byron a sculptor, but Shak-
SFEare was both at once!" The Pope ;uMcd, "Ah, quel Shakis-
pare! Che gigante! che autore! Egli e il pi" grande di tutti gli
artisti!" In delivering which judgment of the Divine Williams,
the great Divine of the Catholic Church was better than passively
infallible, for he was actively wise. Mr. Punch respectfully salutes
His Holiness.
Lord Malmesbury, and somebody in the Commons, have been
asking why Lord Lyons and our Consul took themselves out of
Paris during the siege instead of watching over their distressed
countrymen. The answer as to the Ambassador is satisfactory, he
had diplomatic duties wherever the French Government might be.
The reply in the other case is, that the Consul had leave to go, and
that our distressed countrymen were warned that they had better go
too. Easy to say.
Mr. Trevelyan made an able speech on Army Organisation, but
his object was to turn out the Duke of Cambridge. Whereon there
was lively debate, and it is needless to say that our friend H.R.H.
(whom, differences of opinion, which should never alter friendship,
apart, Mr. Punch holds in both honour and liking, neither of which
will prevent his coming out with the most stunning Cartoon about
the C. in C. at need) found plenty of defenders. The smart speech
was, of course, Mr. Bernax Osborne's. He asked after the Band
of Bounding Brothers who were to have executed splendid Reform
feats in this debate, and claimed for himself the credit of having
turned the Serpentine through the Augean Stable at the Horse
Guards. Mr. Trevelyan's motion failed—201 to 83.
Wednesday. Mr. Plimsoll wished to go on with a Mercantile
Shipping Bill. It is hugely needed for a host of reasons, besides
that there is a very unpleasant idea afloat that vessels not likely to
remain so, are sent out with a view to—the insurance money. Gov-
ernment promised an instalment of legislation, so the Bill was with-
drawn. It is due to gentlemen interested in shipping to say that
several of them expressed an ardent desire to hang anybody who
could be proved guilty of the atrocity above suggested.
Thursday. Lord Carnarvon—by the way, we were very glad to
read that measures arc being adopted for the preservation of the
magnificent Castle that bears his name. It is a noble pile, and
though the last time Mr. Punch visited it he saw it to some disad-
vantage, as it was nearly full of some kind of Welsh Methodists
(most respectable, and probably most pious), who came in their
thousands, and all in black dress coats; the view from the Eagle
Tower would have gratified Mr. Punch much, only he did not go
up, because the day was hot. He would speak well of the iced
soda-water at the hotel, only he could not get any, the Welsh
Methodists aforesaid having methodically drank it all—excuse these
details—Lord Carnarvon attacked the Government Army Scheme,
as patehworky and inadequate. Lord Northbbook defended it.
The Duke of Cakbridoe declared, with touching earnestness, that
he really was an Army Reformer, and that he cared for nothing but
the comfort and efficiency of the soldier. The Lords talked war—
De la Warr finishing—till 10.

the names of places in the Queen's dominions. This is the
famous Ecclesiastical Titles Act. It was passed with popular
acclaim. It is now described as a mere protest which has never
been acted on, but which gives offence to the Catholics. If it is
repealed, they will still be liable to the law forbidding their taking
titles already appropriated by the English Church. There was
particular in the debate, except Mr. CnARLET's gracious
why Mr. Gladstone did not declare outright that he was not
a Papist, and the same Member's 'wish that Mr. Gladstone were

From time to time we have had in London distin-

have been remarkable for the striking oddity of their

has ever come under the public notice was in the case
of the Eastern prince who attended the Queen's Court
last week, and stands on record as " His Imperial High-
ness Higashi-Fubhimi-No-Mia, Uncle of the Mikado
of Japan." What Burlesque can beat this?
Unpardonable Ignorance.
A short time back there appeared in one of the French
papers an article entitled Tout pour Pargent" in
which the writer attempts to turn to ridicule the willing-
ness of the English to accept pecuniary compensation for
the loss of the British vessels lately sunk by the Prus-
sians, and where an imaginary and facetious bill,
supposed to be delivered by Lord Granville to
Count Bismarck, is made to amount to the sum of
£300,000 6«. 12</.!

THE "JUDGMENT" OF PARIS.
oirc, look at this
Initial. Do you see
what it represents P
The Ex-Emperor
Napoleon trying to
escape from a shell.
Yet he behaved
bravely in the
battle-field. Why
then this picture?
Is it Mr. Punch's
wav to insult the
unfortunate? No,
but he desires to
illustrate the ami-
able character of
sundry of the Em-
peror's late sub-
jects, of some of
the millions who the other day voted for him. Be pleased to.read the following
extract from a Paris letter in the Daily Telegraph:—
"Last night I visited a 'cafe" concert' in the Quartier Latin. The chief attraction
there is an actor who bears a striking resemblance to the fallen Emperor Napoleon
the Third. Dressed in a General's uniform, he sings a song, in which the late Emperor's
manner, gesture, twirling of the moustache, and so forth, are imitated with most mar- ,
vellous fidelity. Between every two verses of the song, which embodies witticisms and
allusions in their nature anything but complimentary to the prisoner of Wilhelmshbhe, the
singer gallops round the stage with a long sword dangling between his legs, to the intense
delight of the audience, which unanimously shouts in uproarious chorus, 'Badinguet!
Badinguet!' 'Vive l'Empereur!' 'Encore! Encore!' And the Emperor who so lately
ruled the destinies of France is anew held up for ridicule by his caricaturist."
Just so. And that the lesson may not be lost, Mr. Punch points the moral
and adorns the tale.
NO SUBSTITUTES!
The proposed abolition of the right, in the case of persons balloted for the
Militia, to provide substitutes, or to escape service by the payment of a fine,
is founded on an intelligent regard to equality in the sense of equal justice.
If all men are not equal before the law, they ought to be; and it is obvious that,
suppose a man in business, which cannot go on without him, is compelled to
serve personally as a private in the Militia, he must be mined; but it is no less
obvious that he suffers no greater hardship than his comrade the agricultural
labourer, who, although he gets his daily pay, must lose perhaps as much as nine
or ten shillings a-week. Nothing can be clearer than the truth that equality
as to any burden cannot possibly depend upon circumstances; and, howsoever
people may differ about Vote by Ballot as projected, there cannot, at least among
the thinking commercial classes, be two opinions respecting the contemplated
Ballot for the Militia.
A Dog's Epitaph.

Compton Travers had a favourite poodle. Its name was "Mop," or, as i
was more familiarly called, "Mopsy." Mopsy died. Compton buried it in his
back garden, and affixed a tablet to the wall over the grave. Being a man
of a classic turn and taste, he inscribed the following Drief but appropriate
quotation, from Virgil, on the enamelled slate :—
"Cur non, Mopse."

quickly, so large and compact was the crowd. In the distance it seemed as if

proceeding in either direction at a slow pace. The merry-go-rounds were in
full swing. The .Marionette Theatre was giving its accustomed representa-
tions to a juvenile audience; the sellers of 'jplaisiri' were plying their
wonted trade; the proprietors of weighing-machines were'on the look-out for

PACIFICATORS OF EUROPE.

Catholic priesthood in

example of belief in a fact
which hath not appeared,
combined with a total im-
pereeption of one as plain
as the sun at noonday, or
the nose on the face of
Mr. Punch, has been ex-
hibited by a Belgian eccle-
siastic of no less distinction
than Mgr. Deschamps,
Archbishop of Malincs.
The Timet, in a paragraph
under the heading of
"1 toman Catholic Cere-
mony at Brussels," de-
scribes a solemn'' function"
which was lately performed
there "in the shape of a
Sand pilgrimage to the
lessed Sacrament of the
Miracle." The occasion of
this devotional demonstra-
tion was "the war in
France, and the troubles in
m of the Temporal Power
A WOED FOR THE WOMEN.
CoNSiDERrsro. perhaps, that we British are not a Confessional-
oing people, Archbishop Manning has been kindly constituting
people, archbishop MAJSNnra Has been mnaiy constituting
ill our Father Confessor, by composing a Pastoral, and therein
confessing our national sins for us, very fairly, indeed, for too many
of us men. But perhaps his Grace, if he would reconsider, would
modify somewhat of his confession for the women.
If a man eats and drinks twice as much as is good for him, he
abuses his digestive organs and injures himself in mind and body,
or at least gets unduly fat to no purpose, his superfluous aliment
not being, like a pig's, convertible into bacon.
But a woman's excess in apparel is not like a man's excess in
eating and drinking. It does not hurt her. She may dress a vast
deal more than is necessary for comfort and respectability without
overloading her frame, or impairing her constitution.
The surplus which a glutton transmutes into useless fat, would
serve to feed the hungry. The nude could not be clad with the
mere material superabundance of female attire, a yard or so less or
more as the fashion varies. A woman's over-dressing is not a quan-
titative but a qualitative excess; an excess merely in the sense of
extravagance. As to extravagance of money, that does not hurt her
who can afford it, and money laid out on unnecessary articles of
attire is only so much in effect given away to tradesfolk and work-
people.
array, there ii much
second thoughts, may see to palliate it. It
nearly akin to that of a child's delight in
Italy, which have resulted in the abolition oi tne -temporal rower
of the .Pope." It was improved by the above-named prelate in a
discourse which our leading contemporary thus summarises:—
"At the end of the Gospel Mgr. Deschamps, the Archbishop of Halines
and Primate of Belgium, preached a most touching and appropriate discourse,
in which he pointed out how all the miseries which now afflict European
societies proceed from the fact that nations persist in turning a deaf car to
the voice of the Pope, who was the great pacificator of Europe, who had
endeavoured to promote peace between the rulers of France and Germany,
and for whom the Almighty is now preparing a triumph already marked by
the great movement which agitates the nations of Europe, and prepares them
to pass through war and bloodshed to refind the true light in the forgotten
paths of civilisation and Christianity."
The concluding prophecy of the sermon above-quoted would, to
persons unaware of the preacher's nationality, suggest the supposi-
tion that he was an Irish rather than a Belgian Ultramontane. We
shall see whether Mgr. Deschamps will prove a true prophet. But
if he does, the triumph which in that case will have been vouchsafed
the Pope, marked by a movement which is preparing the nations of
Europe to pass through war and bloodshed, will be an odd triumph
for Europe's great pacificator. No doubt the intentions of His
Holiness are as pacific as any Quaker's, but they have been crowned
with the reverse of fulfilment. Moreover, there has been not a little
fighting occasionally on the Pope's own behalf; wonders, for
example, were worked at Mentana, not by images or relics, but
Chassepot rifles, whose popping was a remarkable accompaniment to
"Pax Vobitcum."
How could Mgr. Deschamps, when he talked of the Holy Father
as the great pacificator of Europe, fail of seeing to whom, if to any
one, that description really applies? There is one Personage in
Europe who has preached peace a great deal more urgently than the
Pope, and has done all he thought he possibly could, at times with
some success, to preserve it. That Personage too has suffered for his
pacific endeavours much more than the Pope. Was the Pope ever
accused of selfish isolation because he would abstain from armed
intervention between his belligerent neighbours, and would not send
his little army to help any of them slaughter others? Was he ever
taunted on tnat account with decline of "prestige," and loss of
position among the Sovereigns of Europe? When he has, with
impartial humanity, exhorted belligerents on either side to be
friends, has he ever, because he would fight for neither, been reviled
by both? Did ever Ambassador outdo all Papal bulls by objecting
to him that he had failed to observe a "benevolent neutrality?^
The Great Pacificator of Europe, so far as his greatness as such
extends, which, truly, it does but a little way, is not the Pope, but
John Bull.
Hardened Offender.
We are rather ashamed of acknowledging that we know a lady,
who, the other day, made no secret of having done what the Law
regards as a very serious offence—nay, openly avowed her satis-
faction at having just hit a train!
ith regard to the
that Dr. Manning, on
evinces an innocence l ...... _
dressing up a doll. The vanity which it betrays is vanity pure and
simple, unintelligent, but no worse. Chignons, rouge, and high
heels, for instance, so far from adding to the wearer's attractions m
male eyes, on the contrary, diminish them exceedingly, tend to
repel men very much, ana not at all to attract them. Women
prank themselves out in such things to please themselves merely,
unless to please, if not to vex, other women.
Lastly, the pecuniary extravagance of the fair sex at large in fal-
lals and finery necessitates a result which ought to be highly satis-
factory to an ecclesiastic of Dr. Manning's persuasion. It deters
every sane man, who is not rolling in wealth, from even entertaining
the thought of taking unto himself a wife, and that greatly conduces
to the promotion of celibacy.
AN IMPOSSIBLE TEST REPEAL.
Abolish all manner of tests for degrees,
And fellowships too, ye who con if you please;

Peroxide of iron inks acid of tan.
Ha, ha! Copper's'salts in solution will you
Ammonia prohibit henceforth to turn blue,

That hydrogen's sulphuret shan't blacken lead!

To stop iodine. We shall see if it will.

because a dog had been victor in some coursing-matches! What more
could have been done had a nation achieved some glorious triumph?
Who would believe that Parliament is obliged to delegate the
Irish-murder question to a Secret Committee?

S. ROBINSON.
Ate—" Jack Robinson."
The perils of my letter-writing: Autumn are past.
And the troubles of the Session must be faced at last;
There's the Army to reform, and the 'Varsities to storm,
But the toughest job of all is this S. Robinson.
For "poor Chtltebs," they may grieve that he's forced to take
sick leave,
With the estimates to move and the Captain's loss retrieve;
But I'd rather I were he, and the sick-leave asked for me,
Than face Somerset's Committee and S. Robinson!
There are messes that don't show while undisturbed they go,
But the more you take to stirring the more savoury they grow;
And just such a mess, I fear, is the one we've got in here,
With this very nasty customer, S. Robinson!
Childers tells me it's a case where a choice I have to face,
That either he or Robinson must slope from Whitehall Place;
A Controller ought to yield, when a First Lord he can shield,
But that doesn't seem the notion of S. Robinson.
I've been courtesy itself in showing him the shelf,
Left him free to name his day for giving up both place and pelf;
He admits I'm very kind, but he says he has a mind
To stay till he's turned out, this tough S. Robinson!
When the First Lord's mem I show, to prove he said he'd go,
He assures me, in plain English, that he never did say so;
And hints the First Lord's mem, like his memory pro tern.,
Is entirely in a fog about S. Robinson.
When to Guilders' minute stout he his answer shows about,
And I beg him to post-date it some time after he's turned out,
He replies, in a sea-burst, "I '11 see you somethinged first—
Truth in figures, as in facts, best suits S. Robinson."
A scape-goat we must have from the First Lord blame to stave,
And, failing Reid, 'tis Robinson must Childers' credit save;
I've tried to make him see how 'tis needful this should be,
But he doesn't seem to see it—dou't S. Robinson!
From scrape to scrape we 're tost, by Somerset we 're crost,
Here's Childers sick with worry, since the Captain has been lost;
And when Jonah o'er we'd throw, he declines, slap-bang, to go,
And says more must be got out than S. Robinson!

1 ear as theres a oxibition of what they call Old Masters to-
be seen in picadilly which hour footmin Mr. Jeams he ses as theyre
remarkable specimints of painting. But lor! ses I to im says I if
you want to see old paintinx you neednt pay a shillin to look at them
Old Masters. Hand Mr. .Teams he quite agree with me that some of
our Old Missuses is reelly quite as curious a specimint of Painting
as any of these Old Masters pawsible can be. Which they has allso
the advantage that our old missuses are exibited in the park and
hother places free gratis and for no-think, with plenty of young
missuses as are painted up to match.
So I remane Sir yours most umble to command,

THE BRITISH WARRIOR'S JOY.
The Times, in a loader on Army Reform, with re-
ference to the Militia, observes that our Force, after next
Midsummer, will include " some 95,000 men who have
enjoyed more or less training already." In perusing this
passage, many a fat old fellow, a base luxurious slave,
whose soul would sicken o'er the heaving wave, has
doubtless grinned, or even laughed outright, at the idea
of any one, let alone 95,000 men, having enjoyed any
amount of training, however small, and not having, on
the contrary, been pestered and plagued with it.
An obese and indolent fogey says to himself, or to
another such as himself, "Ha, ha! Fancy enjoying drill.
One can as well imagine oneself enjoying the treadmill
or the crank. Enjoying military discipline P Enjoying
penal servitude! Enjoying a camp? Enjoying the
Enjoying Aldershott r Enjoying Millbank!
training? Enjoy ill-health!"
Ignoble Epicurean pig, read your Shakspeare, if you
are so far a learned pig, that you can; and see what
Othello tells the lieverend and Gracious:—
"The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
Hath "made the flinty and steel couch of war
My thrice-driven bed of down."
Not only is the "hardness" of a soldier's life nothing
when you are used to it, if yon are a hero, and not a
Sybarite, but it grows absolutely soft in time, and you
find an alacrity " in it, as the valiant Moor did. But
of all the heroes, renowned for gallantry, whether cele-
brated by Shakspeare, or by the historians of Grecian
antiquity, there are none who, regarded with a discern-
ing eye to relative merit, will stand a comparison with
the British grenadier. The labour of learning his busi-
ness is itself a delight to him, enhanced by the con-
sciousness that he is therein doing his duty, insomuch
that he really does so thoroughly enjoy his training as
to esteem it a perfect treat. He cannot but feel duly
grateful to the friendly neighbours whose expressions of
affectionate feeling towards his country have obliged it to
stand that treat, and, at some expense, provide him with
so much enjoyment.

Not long ago the universal question was, "How's

grammatical accuracy, we say, How's your poor arm?"
PUNCH'S FOLK-LORE.
ST. DAVID'S DAY.
St. David—a corruption, according to the best almanacks, of St.
Taffy; thus, Taffy, Daffy, in which form it is found in connection
with a well-known patent medicine, Davy, David—is the patron
Saint of Wales, and nas officiated in that capacity for many years
past, to the entire satisfaction of his fellow-countrymen.
There is a tradition (first mentioned byGiBALnus in his Cambria
and the Cambrics) that as an infant he was exposed on a well-known
Welsh mountain, in a heavy snow-storm, with a turquoise locket
tied round his neck, and there nourished by a goat, an animal which
in its wild state at that period afforded excellent sport to several
packs of hounds, and is still to be found, after care ful inquiry, in
the more remote country districts. A shepherd, of the name of
Jones, discovered the child at two o'clock, and carried him home in
his plaid, where the little boy received every attention from Mrs.
Jones and the family, being fed by her and the eldest girl alter-
nately, night and day, with savoury broth, prepared from a receipt
which had been for generations in the possession of the Evanses
(the shepherdess was an Evans), and consisting principally of Welsh
mutton and the finest leeks.
From this circumstance the leek became the national emblem of
Wales, and is worn conspicuously on the 1st of March (St. David's
birthday) by the Prince and Princess of Wales and their youth-
ful family (splendidly gilt), by every inhabitant of the Principality
who is rated to the relief of the poor, by all Welshmen at home,
abroad, and in our colonies—cargoes of this vegetable are annually
shipped to America, Australia, the Falkland Wands, &c.—and by
the landlord and waiters at the " Welsh Harp."
The national instrument is played at daybreak in St. David's and
the other principal cathedral cities, under the patronage of the
Bishop and the Clergy; and at night an enormous Donfire is lighted
by the Mayors of the Borough Municipalities, wearing their robes
and insignia of office, on Snowdon, which illuminates the features
for miles round, and may be seen, by permission, with a powerful
glass, from the Surrey Hills.
In private circles, ale and excisable liquors are consumed in large
quantities, and the young people have a (lance in the evening. This
is characterised by three peculiarities (an interesting example of the
ancient Welsh Triad of the Cymri)—most of the girls in the room
find partners of the name of Morgan: the harpers are mounted on
the copper, and consume a good deal of refreshment; and at twenty
minutes to twelve the image of a goat and the effigy of Jones, both
garlanded with leeks, are carried in procession by the Men of Harlech,
who march round the garden singing penillions to the tune of "Ar
ht/dd y nog," and a merry peal from the Bells of Aberdovey, and
then deposit the symbols in the wash-house till next anniversary.
Highland Wit.
A gallant Highlander, with whom his friend Mr. Punch has oft
climbed the rugged Ben Primrose, was shut up in Paris during the
siege. One day he got hold of a particularly dry and husky loaf,
whereupon he wittily remarked, "Mar e Bran is e a brathair^ and
wisely ate it. But then you don't know what he meant. The High-
land saying is, "If he is not Bran, he is Bran's brother." Bead

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
onday, February 27.
Government ex-
pounded, through
LOBD KlMBEKLEY,
a Bill for repress-
ing Vagrancv. His
Lordship alluded
to the wisdom of
our ancestors, who,
in the fourteenth
century, punished
persons bestowing
money upon idle
beggars. The late
Archbishop
Whately, who.
they say, declared
that he had com-
mitted many an er-
ror, but never that
of giving a penny to
a street-mendicant,
would probably
have voted for the
re-enactment of
the old law. How-
ever, that is not
proposed yet. A
uniform treatment
of Vagrants is to be adopted, and their habit of treating the Unions
as hotels at which they can sojourn at pleasure, chiefly patronising
those which they approve of, is to be checked. Power is given to
detain an interesting wanderer, if he is shown to be a mere tramp,
but there is to be no hindrance to the travel of an honest man in
search of employment.
It was suggested by Loed Salisbury that railways would convey
this class much more cheaply, provided the claim for compensation
in case of accident were renounced. Lord Kimberley thought that
the railway people ought not to be allowed to kill labourers at dis-
cretion, but that a modification of the present system might be
advisable.
Lord Dufferin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, explained
his duties, and said that so far from having a sinecure, this
Chancellor was "a maid of all work, or charwoman," to his
Ministry.
In answer to Mr. Otway, the Premier said that it had been
instruction to General Walker and Captain Hozier not to

join in any triumphal entry which the Germans might make into
Paris.
The Scotch Eduoation Bill was read a Second Time, in spite of
Northern; Remonstrance that the Ministers were sending it on too
fast. Scotch Members feel, with the landlord in the Antiquary,
that " it is just a beautiful thing to think how long and how care-
fully justice is considered over in this country." But if Bills are to
be passed at [the end of the Session, they must be shoved on at its
beginning.
All this was dull enough, but the House had its revenge. Lord
Hartington moved for the Select Committee to inquire into Ribbon-
crime in Westmeath. This ,'is an Irish", county, in the province of
Leinster, and its capital, Mullingar, is about fifty miles west of
Dublin, whioh is the capital of Ireland. Yet in spite of this approxi-
mation to civilisation, Westmeath, a rich agricultural county, is in
the hands of a sort of Union of scoundrels, who organise murder on
all kinds of agrarianrpretext. Life is not safe, and'woe to the man
who exercises ordinary rights over his property. All this is perfectly
notorious, yet the Government, before taking any strong measures
to root out the Ribbon-assassins, ask for a Committee of Inquiry.
It was to have been Secret, but is only to be partially so, that is,
the doors may be closed when a witness of importance is being
examined, rather a happy thought in the way of a device for pointing
him out to unfriendly notice.
So, there being sundry blots to hit in the Ministerial game, Mr.
Disraeli girded up his loins for a slashing speech, and went at the
Premier and his policy in a delightfully incisive fashion. He
accused him of having made flashy speeches out of Parliament,
about Ireland, and of having vindicated them by measures of Con-
fiscation and Sacrilege. He taunted him with coming to Parliament
to know" how to govern a single county. Altogether, aesthetically
speaking, the effort was effective, and the Conservatives cheered
hugely. Mr. Hardy pointed out that it was admitted that the
police could at any moment lay their hands on the Westmeath
assassins, and ho denounced delay in doing this. Moreover he
quoted the famous and beautiful linos from Pope's Messiah:—
"All crime shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail;
K«tuming Justice lift aloft her scale;
Peace o'er tho ' realm' her olivo wand extend,
And white-robed innocence from Heaven descend."
Which, he said, had been tho Ministerial promise in regard to Ire-
land, if the Ministerial measures were carried. Mr. Chichester
Foetescue replied with much spirit, and while condemning exag-
gerations, asserted that Ireland had greatly improved, and that
Westmeath was an exceptional case. He contrasted Mr. Hardy's
genuine partisanship with tho calculating partisanship of Mb.
Disraeli. There were other speakers, and there seemed a general
feeling that everybody was to be as disagreeablo as his nature per-
mitted, so that the debate was pleasant enough—to hear. It was
adjourned.
Tuesday. The South Australians wish to marry their Wives'
Sisters, and have passed an Act, in their own Parliament, enabling
them to perform that feat. But the Home Government has no idea
of allowing mere colonists to take the lead in such a matter, and has
disallowed the South-Australian law. The antipodes must wait.
Mb. Ayrton explained that though the stone (Amorphous
Dolomite, wc believe) of which the Houses of Parliament are built
is by no means good, there is no immediate danger of the edifice
crumbling to pieces, and there is to bo some new facing. It was
nobody's fault, of course, that the right sort of stone was not
used originally. How the builders of Westminster Abbey must be
amused m Elysium!
As might have been expected, the system of Pedlars' Licences has
proved a nuisance: the police let any vagabond have a licence, and
then he cannot be taken up for mendicancy, which is his real profes-
sion. Ask the ladies in the suburbs how they like the system, and
how pleasant their walks are made by the insolent importunity of
whining tramps.
We had a very serious debate on Local Taxation, but as it came
to nothing, the Previous Question being carried by 211 to 195, Mr.
Punch withholds a lucid exposition of the subject until Government
shall bring in a promised measure.
Wednesday. Dissenters, it seems, often wish to be buried in
churchyards, but do not alwayB like the magnificent service of the
Church. So they agitate (it is the last but one of their grievances)
for a law allowing them to be buried with any ritual which they
may affect. Sundry Churchmen pretended fear lest funerals should
bo made excuses for pronouncing political orations. When will
Englishmen understand Englishmen? We really know very little
about each other, and have not much right to laugh at the ldiotcy
of French writers when they endeavour to describe us. The Second
Reading was carried by 211 to 149, but we apprehend that the
numbers in the House of Lords Spiritual and Temporal will show a
majority the other way, besides that the lawyers will have something
to say about a Parson s rights in his Freehold.
This day, Wednesday, March 1st, 1871, will ever be memorable in
the history of France. For on this day did the victorious
Germans, 30,000 strong, march into and occupy Paris. The first
man who entered]was a handsome Hussar, Lieutenant Bebnhardy,
The young fellow could not restrain himself from just one single
flourish of his sabre, in answer to all the flourishes of all the Parisian
journalists, who had declared that the " barbarians" never would,
could, or should enter the city.
Here note, in reference to much'that has been, and will be said by
sundry papers about the War, that Captain Pen is as honest as
light, and does Captain Swobd all justice, but that Captain de la
Plume is—weU, read the French journals.
Thursday. Fierce fight in the House of Commons on the West-
meath Ribbon Committee. Very good slashing, and a very contemp-
tuous expression on tho fine features of Mr. Punch for those who
could make a hideous system of intimidation and murder a theme
for party warfare. There were two attempts to adjourn the debate,
but they failed, and the Ministers enrriea their motion for a Com-
mittee by 256 to 175—majority, 81; not too large, all things con-
sidered.
The Ecclesiastical Titles Bill has been sent to a Select Committee
that the "law" may be put right by somebody who knows the
meaning of words, and can parse a law-sentence, a gift not vouch-
safed to all who have to obey Acts of Parliament.
Friday. Are we never to have a Revised Prayer Book? To say
notliing of stagnation in the various trades which produce the
volume, thousands of Sponsors are waiting (and under suspicion of
meanness) for the correoted edition. It is of no use giving M. or N.
a book that will be out of date long before he or she can read it.
A Lectionary Bill was produced to-night, and ought to be for-
warded.

SHEPHERDS OF ROMANCE, AND OF REALITY.
"Tell mo, Shepherds, havo you seen
My Floorer pass this way ?"—Sentimental Old Song.
"In the Debate on the Enclosure of Waste Lands, Mr. Walsh stated that in nis County toey were a Nuisance,
productive op incessant quarrels about grazing eights. shepherds had to be engaged, not because they understood
Sheep, but because they were expert at Pugilism."
delivery of letters, was referred by the Postmaster-General to the
Postal Guide. Fair enough, as chaff, but "not tho chat" (as
Mr. Monsell's countrymen say) for a^Minister.
Sir Robert Peel, who has burst into a very animated state of
existence, abused Lord Lyons for not having remained in Paris
during the siege. He also complained of the absence of a Consul.
There was rather warm debate. It was shown that Lord Lyons
could not have discharged his duty as Ambassador if he had
remained shut up, but the excuses on the other point were lame. The
idea of the authorities seems to have been that English folks were
warned to leave Paris, that all the well-to-do English folks did
leave, and that it did not much matter what happened to the 2000
or so who had not means or wish to go away.
Sir F. Goldsmtd objected to the College at Cooper's Hill, for
engineers intended for India. Mr. Grant Duff said that it was
absolutely necessary, for the open market of British talent did not
supply the article wanted. In '68 the Indian Government offered
40 appointments to unrestricted competition, and there were but
59 candidates, of whom only 22 passed the minimum test. The
emolument of each was £240. In f69 there were 70 candidates, and
only 13 passed. Mr. Punch gives these ^details becauso he is per-
petually pestered with applications from young men who state that
they are talented," ana who ask him what tncy are to do. Go to
Cooper's Hill.
This day, Friday, will be about as memorable in France as last
Wednesday. The Treaty of Peace being ratified, the Germans went
out of Pans, and as they passed through the Arch of Triumph they
sent forth thunderous cheers, in token that they had balanced the
victories which the Arch records to have been gained by France
over Germany. May the account be henceforth regarded as closed,
"errors" not " excepted."
BIOLOGY AND BOTHERATION.
Mr. Punch, the other day stumbled on !(not over) the following
passage relative to the " Natural Evolution Theory," in a lecture
delivered not long ago by Professor Tyndall :—
"Many who hold it would probably assent to tho position that at the
present moment all our philosophy, all our poetry, all our science, and all our
art—Plato, Shakspeakb, Newton, and Raphael, are potential in the fires
of the sun."
Are the potential energies of cocks and hens latent in eggs before
they have been sat upon? Mr. Punch is much inclinedto offer a
prize of a million sterling for the best Essay on the question whether
there exists any decree of Consciousness and Volition in the New-
laid Egg. But a million is a good deal of money to pay for any but
a satisfactory answer; and the best answer which Mr. Punch could
get to that question would, he fears, be anything but satisfactory.
UNSELFISH NOTION.
I oft think, if a fortune left
Me some fine day I found I had,
Of reason I should go bereft,
For joy would drive mc dancing mad.
But when reflection I pursue,
It strikes me I should rather cry;
Because, although I can't think who,
Some person would have chanced to die.

Brmon. "Yes. Find a Chaib. You'll Excuse me. You know wiiat Sir Perti.yax Macstcopuaxt says :—' I never could

NO POPERY NO MORE.
In a letter to the Times, 8m George Bowyer complains of the
Ecclesiastical Titles Act Repeal Bill, and says that if he were now in
Parliament he should vote against it. His objection to this Bill is
that, whilst it relieves the Pope's Bishops from penalties which the
use of their titles made them liable to, it declares those titles to be
assumptions, and void. Pointing out that it affects not only those
Bishops, but others as well, he observes: —
"I shall be very much surprised if the Irish Protestants accept a Bill which
places their Bishops in a worse position than that in which they now are,
except merely relieving them from penalties which it is impossible to enforce."
Should the Liberal but Protestant measure which Sib Geobge
Bowyee cries out upon become law, most other people than himself
will be very much surprised if the Irish Protestants do not set their
Roman Catholic fellow-subjects the example of accepting it with
serene satisfaction.
However, the unqualified repeal of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act,
which Sib Geobge Bowyee demands, might probably be rendered a
mere question of time. Very likely events would prove him right
in the belief he thus expresses:—
"And I believe that if we wait, public opinion will before long be suffi-
ciently enlightened to grant us that justice."
Sir George Bowyer may thank Italy and Victor-Emmanuel for
the overthrow of the temporal Popedom, which, by rendering the
British mind nearly indifferent to the subject of ecclesiastical titles,
has rendered the repeal of the Act concerning them possible. _ The
snake of papal monarchy has been scotched extremely, but is not
yet certainly killed. If everybody were quite satisfied, that there
■was an end of it, and that the Pope had ceased for good and all to
be a political factor in Europe, very few people would care to keep
on record an idle protest.against his Holiness's authority.
In the meanwhile, Buppose the Church of this country were to
create a lot of Protestant bishoprics in Italy, and the Italian Legis-
lature declared them void, and the titles derived from them assump-
tions, but allowed their bishops to call themselves what they chose,
and be governed by an Archbishop with his head-quarters in Rome,
does Sir George Bowyee think we should grumble?
AN END OF GLORY.
War's no more quite the old, old story.
The moral sense may be a joke
Unto the Wise, but so is glory.
No longer bards their Muse invoke
To celebrate men's work of slaughter.
The carnage of contending foes,
In deadly fight by land or water,
Is but the theme of dreary prose.
The day of prowess has gone by,
No'stage effect has battle scenery,
Where undistinguished heroes lie,
Swept out of being by machinery.
A name, applied to Boots, no scope
Yields now to any victor's vanity;
And so there is a gleam of hope,
Which streaks the future of humanity.

AWFUL WARNING!

THE REVENGE OF FRANCE.
"The Republic promises you eternal revenge." So say MM. Victor
Hugo and Louis Blanc to the Republicans of the departments of Eastern
France. In so saying they speak as Frenchmen to Frenchmen. But their
utterance is no epigrammatic bombast. It is compendious wisdom. The
Republic does promise the French, if they establish it, revenge which will bo as
eternal as it can be in the nature of things. That is to say, provided the
Republic be permanent and stable Republic. Then there is good reason to
hope, for those who do hope, that it will give them the revenge which it
promises them. What the French people have now to do is to lay aside their
political differences, and unite in the endeavour to repair their national
losses. Their vast material resources will make the completion of this task
expeditious and easy if they brace themselves up to it. Suppose they succeed
in effecting it under a Republican form of Government which shall prove
durable. They will then exhibit to the subjects of the German Empire the
example of a prosperous, happy, and contented French Republic. In the
face of that how long is it probable that his Maiesty the German Kaiser will
continue to wear his Imperial crown? His subjects have a master who'.has
triumphed. But yet they are not happy. Nor will they probably become so
under a military despotism. Very soon, perhaps, the Republic will procure
France a revenge pretty considerably eternal, as the Yankees might say, or as
they would rather say, everlasting. True, the words of the divine Williams,
whom Victor Hugo knows, relative to Banquo and France:—
"But in them Nature's copy's not eteme,"
are equally applicable to an existing Emperor and Crown Prince. If, however,
the Republic of France out of a German Empire beget a German Republic, it
will gratify the French with a revenge at least as eternal as certain personages'
natural lives.
VJ3 VICTIS—ET VICTORIBUS!
OCTOBER 27, 1806 : MARCH 1, 1871.
Some three-score years and five have past,
Since through the Brandenburger Thor,
'Neath boughs bared by October's blast,
Their sloped arms the French victors bore.
While un-plumed hat, plain coat of grey,
Their chief distinguished from the crowd
Of marshals, in war s tinsel gay,
I'nter den Linden pacing proud.
That gate to Frederick's fame of war
Was reared for trophy; as its crown,
A victory from her iron car
On the French victor darkened down.
For ere through Frederick's gate he past,
He had ta'en* Frederick's scarf and sword,
From the bier where, in peace at last,
They slept—the weapon and its Lord.
So to the palace of Berlin,
Flushed Marshals, Emperor pale and proud
Headed the ranks whose trumpet din
Went, knife-like, through tho German crowd.
Who knows what white-hot prayers were breathed
For vengeance, by the wrathful throng,
In silent sullenness that seethed,
As the French victors strode along!
And now Time's wheel has run its round,
Long-hoarded vengeance dealt its blow;
Lo, Berlin's monarch victor crowned,
France in disastrous overthrow!
Lo German princes, German host,
Through France's Arch of Triumph ride,
Wh ile Paris, beat from all but boast,
Looks helpless hate, and powerless pride I
As in that unforgotten day
When Prussia s power and name and fame
From maps and minds seemed burnt away
Beneath Napoleon's feet of flame,
Even so, now, France, crushed and caught
In the hard Prussian's iron band,
To worse extremity seems brought
Than Prussia erst by France's hand.
Yet, now, and then, on ranks and crowd
The impress that marks race from race—
This, brisk and braggart, light and loud;
That, grave and still and stern of face.
Paris, with cruel coward mood
Marring the pose she deems sublime;
Berlin, though conquered, unsubdued,
Putting her trust in toil and time.
And well that trust has been borne out,
Amply French insults wiped away,
While 1 ranee, in shame and headlong rout,
Sin's penance does, pride's price must pay.
And all and moro than France e'er laid
On Germany of wrong and woe,
Germany back to France has paid,
With interest for payment slow.
For Jena. Prentzlau.t Auerstadt,t
And all their rankling wounds of hate
And conquest, the long score is paid,
And France shows small, and Prussia great.
A German Emperor 'neath his heel
Tramples proud Paris, heart and brow,
And Germans joy to make her feel
What France made.Berlin feel ere now.
And if their Frederick's stolen sword
They find not at the Tuileries,
Some set-off Paris oan afford—
A thing to feel, if not to see.
• Our readers hardly need reminding how Napoleon, just
before his triumphal entry into Berlin after the Battle of Jena,
carried off from his coffin in the Garrison Church of Potsdam
the Great Frederick's sword and soarf and cordon of tho Black
Eagle.
t Where Prince Hohenlohe capitulated to Mcrat.
J Where Davoust defeated tho main body of the Prussians,
of whom Napoleon destroyed only a detached corps at Jena.

The great Natoleon's conquering brand
What need from the Inralides to bear?
Ill would it fit a soldier's hand
Since this Napoleon took't to wear?
Yet listen, conqueror, while the shade,
That should sit near thee in thy car,
Whispers how quickly laurels fade,
How swiftly shift the sands of war;
How, sixty-five years since, there came
A mightier Emperor than thou,
Upon Berlin to put the shame
Which thy hand puts on Paris now.
Even as thy heel is on their head,
That on thy folks' head set their heel,
So, ere threescore more years have sped,
The woe thou work'st thy sons may feel.
"Who smite with sword by sword shall fall,"
Holds for kings as for subjects true;
God's mills grind slow, but they grind small,
And he that grinds gives all their due.
MY HEALTH.

Y health has often
been proposed, and
I've returned
thanks for it—such
as it is. Can't
make out what's
the matter with
me. Bigsbt, meet-
ing me in the street ,
exclaims heartily
—(just like Bigs-
by, by the way)—
"Hallo, old fel-
low!" — (every-
one 's an "old

iiy, or, if not an
"old fellow."
you 're " his boy")

this
was information
coming from Bigs-
bt, and look (I can't help it) as much as to say to him. " Bigsby.
my boy "—(you fall at once into the habit of saying "My boy
when with Bigsby)—" You mustn't judge by appearances. The
excitement of seeing you"—(I tumbled upon him round a corner;
he being, of course, the last man I'd expected to see. Query.- If
Bigsby's the last, who was the first? Make a note of this for
my Theory of Precognisances) — " has made me look healthy,
has called up the hectic flush, Bigsby; but no! I am not the robust
creature you imagine me to be."
I do not say this to Bigsby. I look it at him. I only reply,
"Am I?" and retaliate upon him with, "So are you: never Baw
you looking better."
"Why!" cries Bigsby ("cries!" I should say "shouts!" for
wherever Bigsby meets you, so remarkably cheery is he—" cheery"
is his own word—that he must shout at you if he likes you, and the
more he likes you the louder he shouts—" Why, my boy "—(I knew
I should be "his boy" directly)—" you're getting horrid stout?"
And he throws himself back, in a sort of artistic manner, as if to get
a good light on me, and bring out my points. Of course Mrs. Gore
Momi-ison and her two daughters issue at this moment from Fortnum
& Mason's
Mem. "Sweets to the Sweet." Good thing to say to the Mompi-
sons when I meet them at a dinner-party, a propos of Fortnum's.
Mustn't let Bigsby's shouting put it out of my head. This mem is
a mental mem while Bigsby is shouting and I am raising my hat to
the Mompison's.
They look astonished. At least Agatha Mompison does, and ele-
vates ner eyebrows. If I was asked. I should at this moment like
to be seen to advantage; but one can t be with Bigsby. "Ton my
word," he saysj still snouting, and sticking to his subject, "You 're
regularly running into fat."
The Mompisons, all of them, hear this, and I can't help noticing
their heads pushed forward slily, just to take a quiet glance at me
from the carriage window, to see if I am " running to fat."
I wonder what they decide.
If I ever (again) meet Agatha, and we sit out a dance or two in
retirement, and if I commence to talk to her from the depths of my
heart, won t Bigsby's words recur to her mind suddenly (just as one
suddenly thinks of funny things in church), and won t she say to
herself He's running to fat"?
Bother Bigsby—at the same time bless Bigsby. The truth is un-
pleasant, but if it is the truth?
Yes, I think it is. Perhaps Daniel Lambert was once thin.
Everybody must have a beginning; fat men must have a beginning.
I remember smiling at an enormous man who showed me a picture
of a slim young creature, "That, Sir," said he, "was I, years ago."
I own I did not believe him.
I see now it is possible. I am beginning to be fat. That's why
I am melancholy, that's why I am out of spirits, that's why I sleep
heavily, and that's why I can't get on with my scheme for my
"Analytical History of Motion,"whioh is to commence with the First
Revolution of the Earth, and then take everything in its turn.
That's why—I see it now, hang and bless Bigsby !—that's why
I've stuck at the same line of Chapter the Second on "Elementary
Itotation," and have gazed at the paper day after day, torpidly
unable to write a single paragraph, and feeling only inclined to
scribble occasional mems for future work, and generally ending
with scrawling idiotic figures with thin legs, no bodies, and large
noses on the very sheets which ought to have been devoted to the
highest scientific purposes.
Bigsby is right. lam, as it were, an infant Fat Man. There is
such an academical existence as that of a " Commencing Bachelor."
I don't know what it means, and it conveys no very distinct, idea of
a profession to my mind. But I see what a Commencing Fat Man
is. I realise that.

Having nothing particular to do, I '11 call—no, I '11 write to Bigsby,
and ask him if it was only his fun.
At this moment Winton walks in.
Winton is sharp, short, and decisive. His hair curls crisply.
His eyes are here, there, and everywhere. He rubs his hands
briskly while talking, and smacks them with the sort of "flash"
which a conjurer gives to a pack when he is going to show you the
card you choose, when he delivers an oracular opinion.
Winton is a great hand at health. He never (so I believe) over-
eats, never overdrinks, never oversleeps, is always well, lives a good
deal " about," as he calls it, which means that no one is ever certain
as to his address. "The Club," says he, "will always find me;"
and yet not once in twentymonths will you find Winton at his
Club.
However, here he is. He is brown, sunburnt, not an ounce of
flesh too much upon him. I envy Winton as I salute him, and
congratulate him on his health.
"Yes," ho returns, "you ought to come with me"—(ho never
says where)—"and take regular exercise. Your sedentary work
doesn't do. Go in for tennis, or riding, or a good stretch over the
downs;"
I say, "What downs?" expecting an invitation from him to his
house somewhere by the sea. Pleasant.
"0," he replies, rubbing his hands, and chuckling, Anywhere.
You take a little place by the sea, and I '11 come and stop with you,
and put you through your paces." And he slaps his hands, and
smiles amiably.
I must hear more of this.

HOW TO KEEP THE PEACE.
It is to be feared that their High Mightinesses have not read,
with due attention, the Lecture delivered the other day by Professor
Seeley on "The Possible Means of Preventing War in Europe."
Could international war, if not absolutely preventible, be reduced to
a tolerable minimum P Social war is, in England. The police keep the
dangerous classes sufficiently under to restrict murder and theft to
certain limits. Could a Federation of Great Powers, as proposed by
Professor Seeley, narrow European war within analogous Dounds r
The objection that there is nobody eligible to be President of such a
Federation, is one which, modesty shall not prevent Mr. Punch
from hinting, might be obviated. What constitutes the real hin-
drance to it is that, whereas it requires that the Great Powers com-
posing it should correspond to the respectable majority of the British
People, the truth is that there is only one Power in the whole world
which is great, and is not also dangerous in the same sense as our
dangerous classes are. The majority of their High Mightinesses
would never agree to an arrangement which would render an aggres-
sive King, Emperor, or President, liable to be punished as a brigand
chief, or a garotter convicted of robbery with violence.
In the meanwhile, for our own part, the only means of possibly
securing peace, besides constant civility and good conduct toward
our neighbours, will consist in a Navy which snail be strong enough
to sweep the seas, if necessary.

THE THREE CURTAILERS OF TOOLEY STREET.
Mr. Peter Taylor, on behalf of himself and the other two gen-

writes thus to the '' Birmingham Labour Representative League " :—
"I feel much gratified by the approval expressed by the working-men of
Birmingham of our course on the dowry question. You may be sure we are
neither disheartened by our small numbers nor by the 'jeers of the House of
Commons. 'Let those laugh that win,' and the" vote of three last Thursday
was ' the beginning of the end.'"
We do not know what the end is of which the minority of one was
the beginning. We can wait to know. But in the meantime we
can throw another crumb of comfort to Mr. Peter Taylor. From
Reynolds' & Newspaper, an organ understood to command the confi-
dence of those who are not satisfied with existing institutions, we
cull a tribute paid to Mr. Taylor and his two allies by some persons
who also desire some kind of "end." Thus answereth Brook Street
to Tooley Street:—
'* At a meeting of the International Democratic Association, held at the
Wellington Music Hall, Brook Street, Holborn, on Sunday last, Citizen
Southam in the chair, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:—
'That the best thanks of this meeting be given to Citizens Fawcett,

BEHIND THE SCENES.
(The Bachelor Friends of Benedick have just taken their Departure.)
Bencdkk (who has married Money, and still smarts under some of the consequences). "0, I say, Mary Ann, I wish to Goodness you
wouldn't Pet me in Public. I don't so much Mind it—when we 're Alone; but before a Lot of Fellows, hang it all,
you Know!"
Mary Ann (who is up in Mr. Anthony Trollope). "And why not, my Ph(ebus? Should not a Woman Glory in her Love?"
Benedick. "0, Bother!"
ANIMAL PHILANTHROPY.
Either the brute creation is far wealthier, more benevolent, and
better acquainted with all that is going on in the world than anyone
has ever supposed, or else charitable people, in sending anonymous
contributions, assume very grotesque names. The doubt we feel on
this point arises from reading that "The Charity Organisation
Society have received a donation of £100 from ' Two Dormice.'"
If it is really the case that this is a gift from the little sleepy
things (generally thought to be good sort of animals enough, but
nothing remarkable) whose names are appended to the paragraph
quoted, probably Mr. Darwin himself, who knows so much of the
manners and customs of what we are over-ready to call the inferior
creatures, will feel that there is something left even for him to learn,
and will wish that he could have proved the development of man
from such a liberal, generous-hearted protoplasm as the Dormouse.
For ourselves, we would much rather trace our descent from a dor-
mouse than from a zoophyte. (Perhaps [this will set the fashion,
and we shall read of donations from "Two Tabbies," "Three
Kittens," "A Surly Old Bear," "A.Sly Fox," and so on.)
Newfangled Nonsense.
Mucn indignation is said to have been excited in military circles
amongst officers of the old school by a rumour, which has not yet
received official contradiction, that in the new organisation of the
British Army, pipeclay will be superseded by protoplasm.

ACADEMICAL PROSPECTS.
ecent Intelligence from
Cambridge informs us
that—
"The attendance at tho
lectures for women—which
were commenced a year
ago in Cambridge — this
term shows an increase of
more than a third over that
of any preceding term.
Several persons have al-
ready come to Cambridge
with the view of attending
these lectures. A board-
ing-house will be opened
in October for such ladies
as may desire accommoda-
tion of this kind, including
the exhibitioners."
Observe "several
persons" ("jtersonec"
of course, quite the
word) "have already
come t o Cambridge with
r the view of attending
these leotures. A boarding-house will be opened in Ooto er for such ladies," &c.
Matriculation, henceforth, will be the first step towards matrimony, and young
ladies will be " brought out" at tho Universities during term, in preference to
Sreducing them in London during the Season. The " Boarding-houses" will gra-
ually grow into small Colleges and Halls, the old Town and Gown differences
will utterly vanish before the civilisers, all sorts of horse-play will disappear,
and the bright eyes of young Donnas will flash upon aspiring Dons. As to
"Wines," such barbarous customs have, indeed, almost everywhere exploded,
but where they yet remain, they will flee before the march of the Intellectual
Tea-kettle. The degree of " Bachelor" will, we suppose, in time disappear from
the University Degrees, only to remain to signify very much what a " Ten-
year Man" means now, i. e. a man who can't get his degree except by tiring out
the authorities and refusing to leave the University until it is given nim.
"Wrangler," ought to be dropped—possibly it will be. "Pythonesses" might
be the equivalent of "Tho Tripos."
Miss Procter's Works ought (if names go for anything) to be extensively
read. We can imagine a few happy scenes in future;—
Say> The Quad of St. Bride's College. Time, 2 p.m.
Enter Clarence Rackit by Gate and walks quickly in to the Quad. He stops
beneath a window filled with flowers and whistles. No answer. Tie calls.
Clarence. Milly! [A pretty face peers out over the flowers.
Milly. That you. Claret? It's struck two.
Clar. I know. I've just come from my coach's: and look here, instead of
going to the "backs," let's have a ride. Eh? I'll go down to Tliingummy's
and order the horses.
Milly. All right. Won't you come up, and—
[Another sparkling face appears beside Milly'
Clar. Hallo, Laura! What have you got up there?
Laura. Cup; come on. We've been hard at Political Economy and Geology
since ten.
Clarence. 0, have you! Then I'd better take some cup while there's any left.
[Rushes into doorway and up staircase ; door heard to bang. Laughter.
Another Scene. View of Gate of St. Bride's giving on to the Lawn, which runs
down to the river.
Enter Frank and Constance coming out of College.
Frank. I shall get permission from my tutor to stay up during the Vacation
to read.
Constance. I am to " go out" next term. (Thoughtfully.)
Frank. Why don't you ask your Junior Matron to let you stop up and read
(with intention) P The place will be so quiet, not a soul up, except a few reading
men, and perhaps two or three reading girls in for their little go.
Constance (diffidently). I wrote to Mamma to tell her that I was afraid I
should lose a great deal by coming home for the vacation.
Frank. Of course you would. Look here: after the first two weeks of tho
Long are over, Magnum, of Caius, our coach, is going to take us to Wales—me
and three more, for a readingporty.
Constance ^disappointed). Then you won't be here?
Frank. Yes, after that's over. Mrs. Magnum—
Constance. She's our coach—
Frank. Exactly, she '11 take a party too.
Constance^ (innocently). To/Wales?
Frank. You wouldn t separate hush
separate husband and wife!
Constance. 0. I '11 write and ask Mamma directly I get back. I'm sure she'd
let me go anywhere with Mrs. Magnum.
Frank. Then that'll bo all right. We're both going in for an ordinary
degree, and will both come out at the same time. And, then [Pauses.
Constance (with her eyes on the ground, softly). Yes. [Further pause.
Frank (somewhat hoarsely). And then, if you will only
say you—you—(stepson gravel-walk; he looks up, sud-
denly recovering his voice) — 0, here's old Bouncer.
He always wants me to cap him—let's get into the boat.
Here!

they disappear gradually.
The Amateur Dramatio Club of the University will
experience a sensible advantage from the admission of the
Lady Students among its members. Boyish youths will
no longer, as in Shokspearian days, be obliged to appear
as their Beatrices and Helenas, but the parts will be effi-
ciently filled by their proper representatives. And herein,
by the way, might be found the germs of a plan for im-
proving the Stage as a profession. Could we not get
actors and actresses with the B.A. certificate of an educa-
tion P But as this opens up an entirely new subject, we
will drop it for the present. It can lie on the table for
consideration in futuro.

Avuncular Affinity.
It is quite clear that the Marriage Law of England,
instead of bernf too restrictive, is too lax. For instance,
a Pawnbroker is at liberty to marry a woman although
she may be related to him by a tie so intimate as that
of having pledged her ear-rings. Ought a girl to be
allowed to marry her Uncle?

tionaries, to be careful of their grammar, diction, orthoepy, and accent, and
never, not even under the greatest provocation, to neglect or abuse the
aspirate.
To acquaint themselves with at least two modern languages, that they may
be competent to return satisfactory answers to the questions of puzzled and
bewildered foreigners.
To store their minds with passages from our best poets, that they may be able
to beguile the weary hours of night duty by repeating to themselves some of
the choicest gems in the English language.
To make themselves conversant with the multitude of historical, antiquarian,
and literary associations connected with the houses, streets, and parks of the
metropolis (including Victoria Park and the New Cut), that they may possess
another mental resource while officially engaged, and be qualified to inform
strangers and visitors where Alfred toe Great was born, or the celebrated
bootmaker, Hoby, breathed his last; and to point out the exact position of the
posts which Dr. Johnson used to touch when walking down Fleet Street and
the Strand.
In arithmetic, to divide the metropolis into a given number of areas, and
to calculate the average of female domestic servants to be found therein.
To be uniformly polite, good-tempered, and civil, especially at crossings, in
street rows, and in verbal contentions with cabmen, eostermongers, and omnibus
officials.
And, generally, to exercise their mental faculties, that every member of
the force may be quick of apprehension, ready to take up any subject of conver-
sation, prompt to arrest a brilliant thought in its passage through the mind,
and on the alert to imbibe (with a due regard to tempe-
rance) all information he may receive.
N.B. It will be observed by all who are not subject to
hereditary thoughtlessness, that the paragraph at the
head of these few remarks only speaks of City Mission-
aries, as having been engaged in this praiseworthy
educational work; but it is to bo hoped that there are
also West End Missionaries who have looked after
the West End Police.
OUR FAMILY TREE.
Dk Veru, how much is it to trace
The noble line which wo can boast,
Through creatures of the human race,
To Norman William's age at most?
With Adam's origin content.
Let simple folk remain, who can:
Be taught to prize thy high descent
By Darwin—the Descent of Man.
What's thy Crusader, in blest mould
Entombed hard by yon Minster's choir,
To thee, that own'st, in rock of old,
The relics of a Lemur sire?
The first of Jocko's ancient stem
Misdeemed mere mimes of human shape-
Df, Veres and all, we come of them,
Derived from Sir Anthropoid Ape.
Through the tailed Lemurs up, yet down,
The Opossums or the Kangaroos,
To Reptiles, hard as frog to drown.
We Christians go, and likewise Jews.
From Newts amphibious we ascend
To thorough I ishes of the Sea;
In Larva; of Ascidians end,
That is begin, our pedigree.
'Tis true no eye has ever seen
The birth of Species come to pass;
The rule observed has aye that been
Of horse from horse, and ass from ass.
Development seems barred by mides.
To think it therefore puzzles those,
Who may be other men than fools,
How Species first from Species rose.
Faith can the needful stitch bestow
To knit the break in Reason's clue;
'Twas so far oft' and long ago,
That let us hope it is all true.
Science tells no old woman's talc—
The Larva source of Man, withal,
In one both female was and male;
And Man's descent is not a fall.
Dost thou account the leap too great
Assumed-from Jackanapes to Man?
De Vere, thy doubt it may abate
The common British Rough to scan.
That horrid fellow, if thou note,
Thy fellow-man, alas, is he,
How little does he seem remote
From a Baboon—how far from thee!
The Old Masters.
If the marvellous Exhibition, just closed, had pro-
duced no better result than the following (which was
found on a lost catalogue) the Academicians would still
have deserved plaudit. "Suppose Her Majesty had
patted a cat, which purred, but then scratched the
Sovereign, what two Old Masters would have been
named F Puss sang, and Clawed la Urine."

It was the remark of a keen observer, who knew
London thoroughly well, that in all his long experience
he had never seen one of his fellow-men bareheaded in
Hatton Garden.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
onday, March 6. —
Lobs Salisbury
finds that England
has entered into gua-
rantees in favour of
five or six other na-
tions. He is quite
sure that should she
he called on to fulfil
any of these engage-
ments, she would be
unable to do so.
Lord Granville is
quite sure that she
would not, and he is
not disposed to heed
what he calls'' chaff-
ing '' articles in news-
spapers. Yes, M'm,
he used that word in
solemn debate in the
House of Lords, and
who shall object to it
in future? Black-
wood, by the way, says
that Scotchmen do not
—-=> understand "chaff."
Loud Malmesbuby said, in the course of the debate, that when
two eminent continental statesmen conversed they were not " like a
couple of sohoolgirls who talk about their sweethearts, just for the
purpose of saying something." Who told Lobd Malmesbuby that
schoolgirls have sweethearts? We have written to a great number
of most respectable school-mistresses, asking how this is, and the
replies have all been to the effect that no well-regulated young lady
even knows the meaning of the word.
The Pbemieb has altered the words of his Westmeath Committee
motion, so as to preclude the idea that the Government desires to
avoid responsibility. A Vigilance Committee would be the proper
tribunal to deal with the evil—would the Americans lend us one r
It lias been stated by Ministers in both Houses that they have no
knowledge of the existence of a Treaty between Russia and Germany.
Perhaps they will be good enough to make a few polite—indeed
deferential inquiries. If they would Venture to ask whether such a
tiling exists, perhaps, between them and Punch and the (Morning)
Post, they might hear news.
Mb. Bbuce says that Music Halls have no more right than
Theatres to be open on certain religious observance-days. It is no doubt
just that this should be so, but considering that a person who goes
to a Music Hall would have the remotest idea, if any, of what a
religious observance even means, he must no doubt think that some
execrable tyranny is being practised upon him when he finds his
haunt shut up. Yet how to explain matters to such a person is
indeed a puzzle.
Mb. Bbuce says that the Free Trade system in cabs is a failure.
Either cab-owners will not put out a better class of vehicle, or people
will not pay for it. So we must go on with the present abomi-
nations. Look at the cabs in Manchester or Glasgow—clean, large,
comfortable, and as for the drivers, Mr. Punch observed with great
pleasure that a Glasgow Bailie fined a cabman five shillings the
other day only for wearing a seedy hat. There is a new table of
cab regulations issued, but they will be useless. However they
recognise the superiority of the Ansom over the Growler, whereat
there will be unhandsome growling by the latter.
To-day and later. Debate on the new Scheme for lie-organising
the Army. There be several sets of objectors to the plan. The
officers do not like tho abolition of Purchase (0, how dull folk in
hundreds continue to afflict Mr. Punch with letters alluding to this,
and the Reverend Pcbchas decision), and Army Reformers declare
that the proposed re-organisation is valueless. Sham economists
grudge the money for the Purchase of Purchase. Mr. Punch has
no intention of reproducing the Debate, but may tell that one oppo-
nent of the scheme urged that promotion by selection would be
obtained unfairly, for he knew of a young officer who could always
get hunting leave because he daily presented his Colonel's wife with
hothouse flowers. Mb. Buxton used a word which, though perfectly
justifiable, will excite wrath among the least wise of those who love
to be termed the Sons of Toil. He alluded to them as those Falsely
called tho Working Classes.
Tuesday. The Premier announced that Mb. Goschen had been
offered the post of First Lord of the Admiralty, in place of Mr.
Chlldebs, whose health compels his retiring. Mr. Goschen had
accepted, and, said Mb. Gladstone, "I am glad of it." Well, this
is not weather to be particularly glad in, as a general rule, hut
Mr. Punch is not sorry, and his Cartoon shows that he sees no
reason why a clever man, who will no doubt be " at sea" for a time,
should not learn to acquit himself efficiently.
Goschen was useful at the Poor Board,
Where he displayed both nous and knack:
He did good service to the Union,
Now let him serve the Union Jack.
Mr. Stanfeld is his successor in taking care of the Poor, and we
fear that he will find he has enough to do, and more. Does the
Member for Halifax know that in the Beggars' and Vagrants'
Litany in old times there was prayer to be delivered from three
places, one of which was Halifax, which," says Mb. Ray (1757),
is formidable from the law thereof."
Wednesday. A Scotch Game Bill, promoted by Mr. Loch, was
rejected by 154 to 85, but Government make promises hereanent.
And a Bill for Educating the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind, was with-
drawn, after praise of its intention, blame of its execution.
The Wife's Sister up again. Mr. Hardy said something which,
though he is an eminently respectable gentleman, and all that, Mr.
Punch must slightly paraphrase before producing. He would never
consent to a Bui that should enable a lady to step from the grave-
stone of her sister to her husband's hearthstone. By St. Juno, the
epigram is neater so than in the original form. Isn't it, Mr. Hardy?
The Bill came on again later, the Retrospective clause was affirmed
by 133 to 98, and at the end of the week the Bill passed the Com-
mons without f uither obstruction.
Thursday. Smart debate in the Lords. Earl Grey is much dis-
Sisted at the remission of the sentences on those Fenians. Lobd
OFFERiN had to defend it. But Lord Caxbns improved the situa-
tion by bringing in an elaborate narrative of the crimes of the
Ribbon-men. Lobd Derby took a dismal view of Ireland, but he
ended with this very cool and neat allusion to the reception of the
Fenians in America:—
"Considering the great courtesy and honour with which they were treated
by our own Government (Hear, hiar)x I do not think there was anything un-
friendly in the House of Representatives having continued that courtesy and
honour to them (hear and laughter). And in the next place it is for that
assembly, like all other similar bodies, to judge what company it chooses to
keep, and if they will only extend the same to all those who leave our gaol*,
they will help us very greatly in solving that difficult and perplexing ques-
tion, 'What to do with our criminals.'
I If Lobd Debby does not find the rent-roll in Lancashire adequate
to his wishes, and would like to make honourable addition to his
income, he will hear of something to his advantage by calling at
85, Fleet Street]
In the Commons we were informed that Canada is in a satis-
factory state of defence, and that on an emergency the Governor-
General would place 40,000 well-armed men in the field in a few
hours. Could the Horse-Guards?
Army debate resumed, and a clever speech by Lobd Elcho, who
opposes the Government scheme. He considers the British Army,
Militia, and Volunteers to bo all ill-managed, and he has a right to
be heard on a subject on which he has expended so much energy—
(which word by the way reminds us that in an earlier debate,
Mr. Lowe, promising to reduce the National Debt when he brings
in his Budget, said that " energy was not a good thing in itself, but
only when a good thing could not be got without it." Bustling
cusses who are always in a hurry-bluster state, please copy.)
Sir Henby Storks made a capital speech, and declared himself
strongly against the Purchase System. Now, he knows, he does.
He said that officers' Vested Interests were incessantly in the way
when improvement in our system was attempted.
Friday.—Mrs. Martha Torpey's acquittal was discussed in the
Lords, and the Lord Chancellor intimated, of course with due
decorum, that the jury did not attend to, or did not understand the
Recorder's charge. We rather think the fact was that Sentiment-
alism got into the jury-box. The Chancellor also made great fun
of the case brought up by CrrrzEN Taylor that evening, touching
which more anon.
This Citizen Taylor had got one of his interesting cases, a story
about a woman who was convicted at Pershore, and who in emula-
tion of Mrs. Tobpey, made great play with a baby, and also
screamed in a furious manner. Of course, these arguments would
have been enough for a Clerkenwell jury, but country Magistrates
are not so "impressionable" (as the Lord Chancellob said), and
they discovered that the woman was profligate, and that " her baby,"
which had been put out to nurse, had been sent for to make an effect
in Court. A gushing reporter did the rest. Mr. Bruce had no
intention of interfering.
An Education Debate in the Commons. Mr. Winterbotham
expressed satisfaction that it had not been "venomotis," but he will
certainly catch it from sundry, for in speaking about teaching music,
he alluded to " those howling little savages, the Charity Children in
St. Paul's." Good gracious, another of our Institutions menaced!

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
Tsn't it a stock thing to say that Jubaj,, or Handel, or somebody
fainted away with ecstasy when he first heard these Charity Children
sing? Moreover, Mb. WrNTEn.BOTHA.si requested Mb. Fobstee not
to oppose the teaching good music, not in fact to go. down to pos-
terity as an Uncouth Barbarian. Mb. Fo-kstee asserted that he was
nothing of the kind, and Punch really thinks that Mb. Fobstee
is neither uncouth nor barbarous. It will be thought that the
debate (which ended in the utter overthrow of an attempt to spoil
the new system) if not venomous, elicited—'well—some little
Personality.
THE BLESSINGS OF PEACE.
{As described in a Letter from a fashionable Young Lady.)
Deae Mb. Punch,
0, I am so glad the dreadful War is over! Those poor
French! my heart bleeds for them! I declare for the last six-
months I have been made miserable by thinking of their misery,
and fancying what ever should we do without them, if they were
aneantis, as some of them predicted. Why, I haven't seen a pretty
bonnet all the winter; and only think what frights our milliners
would make of us, if there were no Paris to instruct them in the
fashions! Luckily for me, I had some patterns sent me by balloon
at the beginning of the siege, and so I 'vc managed pretty well by
making my own dresses. But all the girls I know have been looking
perfect guys ever since September. And there really is no knowing
what dreadful things might possibly have happened in society, if
peace had not been settled. It was, of course, entirely owing to the
War that those hideous long coats were invented for you gentlemen,
for no doubt you thought it didn't matter how you dressed, while
everyone was thinking too much of the War to notice you. And
see what frightful changes in costume these long coats might have
led to!—
'' These garments are perhaps more comfortable than picturesque; but they
are interesting to behold, inasmuch as they arc a symptom of courage in
respect of dress which leads to the hope that a mighty revolution is at baud
productive of convenience to all mankind. A man who is brave enough to
walk down Regent Street enveloped in a wrapper so long, so ample, that spec-
tators are obliged to trust to hit honour that he has any clothes beneath it,
surely would not be afraid to discard the uncomfortable hat which has so long
interfered with human happiness, and wear in its stead a wideawake or
'billycock.'"
Already shooting-coats and hobnail boots are not uncommon in a
drawing-room; and had the War gone on, I dare say wideawakes
would have been worn in Rotten Row, and horrid Berlin woollen
gloves instead of nice French kid! Nor would it have contented
you to look hideous by daylight, but dreadful novelties are darkly
here in print foreshadowed for London after dark:—
"Agreat revolution is urgently required in what is called ' evening dress'
for both men and women. Some costume, perhaps, will one day be discovered
enabling the wearer to be independent of cabs and carriages. Society will
really never be comfortable until people can walk to it."
Only see what a misfortune it must be to a fashionable mind to be
cut oft from all fashionable intercourse with Paris! Who would
ever dream of "walking to society," or of feeling oneself "com-
fortable," in a fifty guinea evening dress of M. Wobth's invention?
Yet this is what this scribbling revolutionist desires for us:—
"Ladies ought to be able to walk to their balls and parties through orderly
streets, clothed in long wrappers something like those which have covered the
divine form of man this winter, wearing overshoes, and, if need be, carrying
umbrellas over their heads."
Imagine me in a long wrapper, looking something like a dressing-
gown, trudging through the slushy streets at twelve o'clock at
night, with those nasty-smelling, sticky goloshes on my feet, and a
great big cotton umbrella overhead! For economy, of course, would
make me always take a cotton umbrella to a party, to say nothing
of the chance there would be of one's losing it if it were a silk
one. Fancy, too, the footman coming up to one, and saying,
"Miss, your gingham's at the door!" or announcing on the stair-
case that "Lady Swellington's goloshes and wrapper stop the
way!" Fancy, too but I forbear! The picture is too terrible!
Only some one of your clever artists ought to do it, just to show
what horrors there might happen in the fashionable world if Eng-
land were debarred from copying French fashions, and adopted
what some. Englishmen would call reforms in dress.
Meanwhile, believe me your most constant reader and admirer,

oiid Luroan's famous Champion Irish Greyhound has
had the honour of being presented toHEu Majesty at'Windsor.—Court Journal.
Ah thin, when was hound, anny time, anny where,
Be he hound that hunts foxes, or hound that hunts hare,
Be he Saxon, Gael, Cymru, or Irish, like me,
That was asked a Queen's guest in her palaco to be?
Had his mate wid Hee Majesty—divil a less!
And was kissed by Louise, my own darlin' Princess!
Sure a Knight of the Gartner, or Knight of the Bath,
Is the next thing that's in it for Masther M' Orath.'
I 've heerd say that Cats may look Queens in the face;
Thin why wouldn't hounds of the raal ould race P
Sure it 'e our breed that coorsed for King Bbian Boeoo,
Kino Cobmac, King Deemot, and King Phill-a-loo,
In the days the Milasiau blood had the land.
Whin a boy kept his head wid the strinth of his hand,
And the King and his men took what came in their path,
As if subjects was hares, the King Masther M Grath.
But now times is changed, and some say for the worse,
And they, tell you Ould Ireland's been crassed wid a curse.
But to spake wid a Queen av' a hound might make bould,
I'd say, "Don't you lave poor Pat out in the could:
Niver mind all thim editors' bunkum and brags,
Nor thim Fenian sunbursts, green ribbons, and flags;
You've froth widout fury, and wind widout wrath,
There's a dale such in Ireland—trust Masther M'Grath.
"You b'lieve one knows the place, from Lough Foyle to Cape Clear,
Let the Queen on the Green Isle look in once a-ycar;
On the Rath Biogh* at Tara the palace restore,
And in Erin sit crowned, Erin's monarch once more—
Let Saxon and Gael of their loyalty crow,
But warmer than theirs Erin's warm heart would glow,
And like mists in the sun would melt hatred and wrath,
In the light of your presence—trust Masther 31' Grath.
"In Westmeath there's Ribbon-men, Fenians in Cork,
Tipperary improvers are best home by dark:
There's blackguards who '11 pay what they've not pluck to do,
Who murder and thraison by proxy purshue;
But now we have justice in Church and in Land,
On thim spalpeens let Law lay the weight of her hand:
Once show them her swoord is no dagger of lath,
They '11 not play with that edge-tool—trust Masther HP Grath.
"They may vow that the Saxon they '11 push from his shtool,
Talk of Ireland for Irish and National Rule.
There's an ould sayin', 'Every dog has his day'—
And here's one Irish dog's gettin' his, any way—
But I doubt if the day of the Saxon's gone by,
While Irishmen think ' Irish needn't apply.'
Let but Ireland once put her bright brains to her task,
And soon of the Saxon no favours she'd ask.
David wasn't so strong as Goliath of Gath—
Pluck, and wits—that s the chat!—so says Masther M'Grath."

POOR JOE.
(Respectfully Dedicated to the EightHonocbable Joachim G-sch-n,
M.P., by his friend, Mb. Punch.)
Air.—"Poor Jack."
Go, call me a lubber, a swab all at sea,
Green-hand, Johnny Raw, if you like;
The right sort of Board to hold on to give me,
And it ain't to a sailor I'll strike.
Though as Landsman at first with sea-Lords I've to fight,
They '11 find their Board's head isn't Wood:
I should like to see Dacbes from Goschen take flight,
And to Halifax steer,—if he could!
Avast! and don't think me a spooney so soft
For a squall at first start to turn back;
I've no doubt there's a Providence looks out aloft
For poor Joe, as he does for poor Jack.
Constructors, Controllers, and First I.ords, in fray
Over high and low free-boards and sich.
Have been fighting for years, each to get his own way,
And his rival to leave in a ditch.
But with temper and tact at the helm in J. G.
No more tempests in tea-cups shall grow;
Those who choose to go straight shall go smoothly for me,
Nor my word find a word and a blow.
Fools who brave the wind's eye in a squall are caught oft,
When wise men make their port by a tack;
I know what a head's worth, for going aloft,
Though my name may be Joe, and not Jack.
And when in the wrong—as, however I try
To be right, I may happen to be—
Of argument showing I'm right I '11 fight shy,
Nor Btrive to prove all fools but me!
For opinion's wide, and there's room for us all,
Reids, Robinsons, Goschens, and more;
Why should heads of an office to loggerheads fall,
Sea or Land Lords, afloat or on snore P
If I fail—all's a hazard—my head's not so soft
To be ta'en, e'en by ship-wreck, aback;
So let's stick to the ship, boys, whose flag flies aloft—
Friendship's ensign—the Union Jack.
Now-a-days a First Lord should be, every inch,
Like a foot-and-a-half plated ship;
For broadside of House nor of Press ought to flinch,
Nor his own judgment's moorings let slip. _
Let the newspaper chaps be his foes or his friends,
Treat him daily to soft-soap or sting;
Public int'rest, the Service, must still bo his ends,
WTiile he leaves town and press to their fling.
Case-hardened in time, though at first ne'er so soft,
He '11 find both his brow and his back,
And he '11 say, as I say, "Crack your cheeks, winds, aloft,
You '11 no more fright poor Joe" than poor Jack!"
A Useful Manual.
"Mixing in Society." What does this book teach? How to mix
salad, how to mix punch, how to mix summer beverages, how not
to mix wines? If so, we will buy the volume without any needless
delay, and exhaust the edition by presenting copies of it to all our
young friends just beginning life.
Le Nom Ne Vaut Rien.
In France Alsace and Lorraine go together. When there was an
Alsace in London, it was a territory where 'twas impossible there
could be any Law-reign.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
MY HEALTH.
On collecting the advice of my friends on this subjeot, 1 find it
convenient to classify their opinions thus:—
1. To walk like old boots every day for three hours.—Sympson'b
Opinion.
3. That I ought to do gymnastios every morning for an hour,
and go in for a turn with die gloves for two hours before
dinner.—Muggebidge's Opinion.
Mem. Notion of the gloves not bad, if I could find a professor
; who would bind himself solemnly not to hit me on the nose. Some-
body in great suffering once exclaimed " All this to crush a worm!"
When one feels the sort of muscular buffer coming with a deadened
blow on what the P. It. terms the " smeller," so that you feel that
organ suddenly spread (as it were) over your face, and your eyes
watering violently, then one feels inolinea to adopt the above, and
cry, "All this to smash a nose!"
2nd Mem. on this Subject. The punishment of the nose because the
hands are fighting, is a specimen of uneven-handed justice where
the innocent suffers for the guilty.
3. To go in for the Cold Water Cure.—Viddle's Idea.
4. To get change of scene. Hun about everywhere.—Fluter's
Idea, accompanied by a practical suggestion to the effect that,
if I'll pay half his expenses, he 'U travel with me anywhere.
Mem. Flutes's not a bad fellow; and if no one else will go,
Query, is he worth it? What's the proverb say ?" Better to De
alone than to pay half of another fellow's travelling expenses," or
something to that effect.
5. Go and stay with Gilveb in the North. He '11 be delighted
to see you.—Richard's Opinion.
Richard is a cousin of mine, and he thought I was going to pro-
pose coming to stop with Aim.
Various Opinions (all unprofessional). Go in for diet.—Cut off
lunch.—Get up early.—Go to bed early.—Get up late.—
Take hot baths only.—Take nothing but cold water.—Take
a shower-bath before dinner.—Never take a shower-bath
by any chance.—Walk before breakfast.—Never walk before
breakfast, but immediately after.—Get the morning air.—
Morning air worst thing for me: death in fact.—Never go
out until 2 p.m.—Hunt.—On no account venture to hunt.—
Take medicine every other day.—Rashest thing for me to
take any medicine: play Old Gooseberry with me.—Live
high—Live low—Walk—Lie down—Run—Jump—Shoot—
Box—Drive—Sing—Dance—Eat vegetables—Never touch
any green meat.—Take no pastry.—Take anything.—Never
touon tea or coffee.—Never touch coffee: take tea.—Never
touch either.—Take weak tea last thing at night.—Never at
night, but first thing in the morning, &c, &c, &c.
I nit in and consider the matter. I go out and consider the matter.
I am restless. I can't work. I feel depressed. Coming events
begin to cast their shadows before me, and, on t/eflexion, I feel sure
that I am getting fat.
What'shisname's awful words haunt me—" running to fat," just
as weeds or strawberries spread out (awful simile!) and run to seed.
It won't bear thinking of.
I've a headache. It suddenly comes on at the corner of Sackville
Street, where my friend Mulfer lives. Mulfer? Odd it never
occurred to me till this moment that Mulfer is the rising young
Practitioner of the day. I '11 consult Mulfer. He '11 advise me as
a friend and as a medical man; or, seeing that I know beforehand
his advice will be gratis, the characters will be amalgamated, and
he '11 be my Medical Friend.
I tell him (he's delighted to see me in his little back study with a
case of the brightest surgical instruments on the table, a picture of
Professor Somebody on the wall, and a bookcase full of professional
literature) that I have not called in professionally (this will remove
all delicacy on his part and mine about a fee, and reduce the affair
to a mere friendly visit), but just to see him, and ask him how
he is.
Mem. Not a bad idea for getting an opinion from a doctor. Call
in and ask him how he is. Hint for conversation with doctor:—
Friend. How d'ye do? How are you?
Doctor. Ah! How d 'ye do? How are you?
Friend (seizes the opportunity for a "full and particular," and
details all his symptoms). How am I? Ah, that's it, &c.
(Sere follow the complaints.)
I tell him how lam. I tell him how I have been. I tell him
bow my headache has just come on, taking me at the side of the
nose, going up to the top of my head, round behind my ear, and
down again to my jaw, until it seems to turn into a toothache.
I tell nim that I am getting fat. I tell him that I feel generally
speaking " anyhow."
"You want a regular change," says Mulfer. "Go away for six
months at least."
After expressing this opinion, he looks at his watch, says he's
rather pressed for time, will I exouse him P rings a bell, then there's
a knock at the front door, then his mysterious man enters to ask "if
he shall show Lord Aubr"
Mulfer stops him in the middle of his indiscretion, and tells him.
"Up-stairs."
"And Lady Court "(his mysterious man begins again).
Once more Mulfer (who, I see, attends the aristocracy) stops him
quickly, and tells him, "back room," then looks at me, as muoh as
to say, You see how busy I am."
I <7o see how busy he is. I thank him very much, promise to
"let him see me again soon." He replies, "Do," but not heartily,
and I show myself out into the dark passage, and into the arms of
the mysterious servitor, who lets me open the front door for myself
(I'm evidently not worth half-a-crowns for future interviews, and
he sees it with a practised eye), while he ushers a lady out of the
front room into the sanctum.
There are coroneted carriages about the door. Mulfer is getting
on, and I've been taking up his time.
Mem. (in pocket-book). To ask Mulfer to dinner when I come
back. At present, to take his advice, and go away, for change.
Where?
I am melancholy. As I think of going away for change, I am
depressed.
I will go and call on my Aunt. It's an odd thing that whenever
I'm depressed I always feel I should like to go and call on my Aunt
Henry (Henrietta is her full name), and I generally do.
The idea of calling on my Aunt when miserable, originated (I can
distinctly trace it) in an ancient and laudable custom of my boyhood.
The occasions of greatest depression to me when a boy were un-
doubtedly the days of my return to school, and these became to me
"times of refreshening, as a lawyer might say, because I went the
round of my relations in London, and made a collection to defray
the expenses, or, as it were, encourage the performance, of my going
back to school. I knew as well as a street musician or a country
tramp the houses that were good for anything, and also could reokon
beforehand, to a shilling, how much they were good for.
My Aunt was uniformly one sovereign. I visited her, beaming,
at half-past eleven, a.m. Commencing my tour with her, we were
delighted to see each other, she made inquiries about my progress at
school, and fetched her purse out of her workbox, I, meantime,
delicately pretending not to know what was going on. Then, after
stopping there a quarter of an hour, I rose to leave, and she pressed
a sovereign into my hand, for which I used to thank her heartily
and blushingly, and giving her a kiss (as a sort of set-off), bade her
good-bye.
Thus it happens that, whenever I'm in as low sprits as I used to
be on going-back days, I always instinctively turn towards my
Aunt.
My Aunt Henry (or Henrietta) is of sad temperament, and
dresses (for no particular reason) something like a Lady Abbess, or,
to give a better idea of her costume, as a Lady Abbess might be if
she had a brougham, and was going out shopping in Regent Street.
"Well, my dear, she says, after hearing my statement of suf-
fering, "I should say that quiet and repose would do all you want
for you."
I assent.
"With, of course, a thorough change of scenery."
I assent again. I fancy she contemplates making me a handsome
present (nothing like reviving good old oustoms), and paying my
expenses for a continental trip.
"Change of scene," she continues, meditatively, "and change of
people."
Certainly; quite my views on the subjeot.
"You should have no anxiety or trouble for some time, for in-
stance," she goes on, myself assenting to every particular; and so,
I think "(she's adding up what she's going to "come down
with ") "if you were to come down "(ahem! the coming down
I'd expected from her) "with me to Ramsgate, you could —in a
burst of generosity—" stay there for a fortnight or three weeks."
I am very much obliged. I accept. Ramsgate is near Dover,
Dover to Ostend, and so forth. A little diplomacy will manage it.
Diplomacy says, "Cultivate your Aunt." I will.
We go to-morrow. The party consists of my Aunt, her maid (a
nice young girl of about fifty-three), a small King Charles (retained
on the establishment for past services), and a melancholy turtle-
dove in a wicker-cage. Our united ages amount to but no matter;
I foresee quiet, rest, and irresponsibility.
On looking over my Mems 1 find that I had set down, "Call on
Minsley about certain commissions in town." As I shan't have
any time to see him to-morrow, it occurs to me, after finishing my
packing, that I '11 look him up (10'30 f.m.J to-night. Minsley has

on the tahle, one nearly empty, the other half full, and some legal-
looking papers are lying between them.
Minsley and friend have either had quite as much as is good for
them, or have been both fast asleep.
Both attempt to be excessively polite. The friend smiles and
bows, and evidently would rise if ne could only move his chair away
from the tahle.
Minsley says, "Aha!" and looks at me as if trying to see me
through a mist.
I am introduced to his friend (who tries to rise again, and is
puzzled by his chair), whose name seems to be, as pronounced by
Minsley, Mr. 'Wednesday.
He says, "Let me in'duce Mis' Wens'day," and omits my name
entirely. Mr. Wensday smiles blandly, and in waving Ids hand
(intending, 1 fancy, to motion me with the utmost politeness to a
seat), upsets a wine-glass. _ At this they both laugh, though Wens-
day appears to be a little discomfited, and mutters something about
"'ts not being worth mentioning." I seat myself, and am about to
address Minsley, when I notice that he is suddenly dozing, while
Wensday is still bowing to me, and smiling.
I observe to Minsley that if he's too sleepy to attend to business
now, I '11 write to him, as I shan't have time to call before leaving
town.
He wakes up at the mention of business, and replies, " Certainly.
I can 'tend. Go on." Then, by a sudden inspiration, "Take some-
thing." Whereupon Wensday, who is helping himself to claret
(and pouring some on the law papers), "begs pardon, and hopes I '11
join —with which he knocks over his wine-glass, and looking
angrily round, as if some one had jogged his elbow, says, "Wai'r,
wine-glass to thisgen'man." Then he smiles upon me as before.
Whatever Minsley is, there is no doubt about it Wensday's
very far gone.
I found out afterwards that his name is Middleborough, but
that before I came in they'd been discussing something important
to be done on Wednesday, and Minsley (so he says) had somehow
got the word on his lips, and really was quite unaware he'd made
the mistake.
Mem. This explanation comes to me by post, days after.

not proposing a toast. More smiles from Wensday. While this
passage is occurring between us, Minsley goes beyond a doze, and
fairly snores.
As it is improbable I shall get him to attend to any business (and
mine being important and pecuniary, requires a clear head), I rise
to go.
I leave Wensday—quite unable to get away from his chair, hut
polite to the last—smiling, bowing, and saying something indis-
tinctly, "Bett'r stop—fish it "—(he means " finish it," it being the
bottle)—and Minsley fast asleep, with his chin hiding his white tie.

A MARTYR TO PRINCIPLE.
When Mb. Robert Hardiment, who has been
imprisoned in Norwich Castle for bribery at the Norwich
Parliamentary election of November, 1868, and the
Norwich Municipal election of November, 1869, was
released the other day, his friends escorted him in an
open carriage drawn by gray horses, with banners
displayed, and two brass bands playing "Auld Lang
Syne."
The one brass band, we suppose, was in honour of
the Parliamentary bribery, the other of the municipal.
A French admirer of British institutions, now here for
the purpose of studying our representative system, was
much edified, and remarked, C'est tortir de priton

A PUNCH PROPHECY.
Mr. Punch is the original True Thomas. His words are never
untrue—unless he means them to be so—which he seldom docs; in
fact only on the occasions in respect to which the True Thomas of
fiction offered his remonstrance to the Queen of Faery. The latter
Thomas energetically protested against being favoured with "a
tongue that could never lee."
"My tongue U my ain," then Thomas he said,
A gudcly gift ye wad gie to me!
I neither dought to buy or sell.
At fair or tryst where I might be.
I dought neither speak to priest or peer,
Nor ask of grace from fair ladye.
Reserving his rights in the above emergencies, and one or two
others, Mr. Punch Habitually speoketh with the tongue that " cannot
lee." As an instance of his prophetic gift, he invites perusal of the
following brief passage from a dialogue which he gave to the
universe on the 16th of January, 1869. The conversation, between
the exiled young: Prince of Spain, and the Prince Imperial of
France, comprised these words:—
"Prince Imperial. My Papa's dynasty is secure.
Princ* of Asturia. How do you know that, my dear Louis?
Prince Imperial. Whisper. He knows all about it. He gives the Mar-
shals all they desire, and keeps them in the best temper with us.
Prince of Aslurta. You are a year older than I am, Louis, and therefore
I must not teach you. But I will only say that my Mamma did
exactly the same, and here tee are."
Mr. Punch reprints this, not out of the vanity of proving his own
prescience, which all the world acknowledges, but in order to say
that what was to happen was to happen, that illustrious exiles are
heartily welcome to England, and that he does hope that their
privaoy will be respected.
THE TWO ENDS OF A CANDLISH.
Mr. Candlish would have us put down
Compulsory Vaccination,
And pay off the National Debt
By stern self-abnegation.
To the stout M.P. for Sunderland,
Mr. Punch recommends
The proverb that warns 'gainst lighting
Your Candlish at both ends.
To such double lighting in this case,
The objection's a specially strong one,
When, if Candlish has one right end,
He has also, as clearly, a wrong one.
But let's hope he's as unlikely
Vaccination law to upset,
As we fear he's to coax the Nation
Into paying the National Debt.
MONMOUTH AND SOMERSET.
Monmouth has returned Somerset. This announcement is ex-
plained by the following newspaper paragraph:—
"The Representation of Monmouth. — Lord Henry Somerset was
elected, unopposed, for Monmouthshire on Saturday morning. His Lordship
announced himself a Conservative, and denounced the state of the Army and
Navy."
With regard to military and naval affairs, then, the new Member
for Monmouthshire is a Reformer. As such, if he do the State ser-
vice, Monmouth will have to be congratulated on not having flung a

In these retrograde days, wo catch eagerly at the slightest hope

"We hear that the Han-

ment* of several English

which, like that of the

it may be noped, be
brought to bear upon the
American character with
a degree of advantage.
Absorbing devotion to
commercial pursuits has
rendered that character
susceptible of some im-

gions of the mind of
which the development
is promoted by any im-

of deriving from divine

that the mission of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

Monday, March 13.—In both houses announcement was made of the con-
clusion of the Black Sea Conference, and of the result of its discussions. As
there has already begun a portentous disturbance on the subject, and as the
best of the French journals informs the world that England has flung away
all the fruits of the Crimean war: that she has begun to suffer by her Prussian
policy, and by Lord Granville's obsequiousness to Family Predilections, we
will set forth in the most prosaic manner what Lord Granville, late President
of the Conference, stated the conclusions to be:—
1. The Clauses of the Treaty of 185G neutralising the Black Sea are
abrogated.
2. The restrictions imposed by previously existing Treaties upon the Porte
in regard to the closing of the Straits of the Dardanelles and Bos-
phorus when the Porte is at peace are so far modified as to admit of
her opening them, even in time of peace, to the ships of war of
friendly and allied Powers, in case the Porte should deem it necessary.
3. The European Commission of the Danube is prolonged for Twelve Years.
4. Continual neutrality of the works already created, or to be created, by
the Commission.
5. Right of the Porte to send war-ships into the Danube.
So much for the new arrangements. Then, by way of postscript to the
famous Circular of the Russian Minister, declaring that the Czar would no
longer be bound by the Treaty, the Representative of Russia has had to sign
this .—
"It IS AN ESSENTIA! PRINCIPLE OF THE LAW OF NATIONS THAT NO POWER
CAN LIBERATE ITSELF FROM THE ENGAGEMENTS OF A TREATY, NOR
MODIFY TEE STIPULATIONS THEREOF, UNLESS WITH THE CONSENT OF
THE CONTRACTING POWERS, BY MEANS OF AN AMICABLE ARRANGEMENT."
Commending all which to his beloved Public for calm consideration when the
present Festivities shall be over (of a truth Mr. Punch's Loyalty has had to
take the form of so many toasts to the happiness of The Couple, that he is
slightly indisposed to political dissertation), Mr. Punch is happy to say that in
Parliament, in the Press, and everywhere else where a row can be kicked up
on the proceedings of the Conference, up-kicked will that row be. But for
the hour let us celebrate the joyous Treaty between the Houses of Brunswick
and of Campbell.
In this—what shall we call it f—Rubicund (that's a good word, and totally
inapplicable) Spirit, let us briefly dispose of the Parliamentary utterances of
the past week. They have not been unimportant, but, like all really im-
portant things, they may be described in a few words.
For instance, the Pillar Letter Boxes are not to be made big, to receive
newspapers, books, parcels. As it is, the slits are too
wide, and not a day passes but Mr. Punch beholds some
idiot painfully ramming a newspaper into the pillar, and
accomplishing his purpose by dint of hard Bhoving and
prods with a stick or umbrella. Mr. Punch calmly
watches the process, and as soon as the scrunched article
has descended, he sweetly informs the poster that the
paper will not be delivered. The usual reply is " Who
cares?" the party wisely remembering that it is his or
her employer s business,not his or hern. But Mr. Punch
is sometimes asked, " Why didn't yer say so before?".
To which, if the querist be much smaller than Mr.
Punch, he answers, "Can't you read the notice, you
something or something?" (as the case may be).
The Lords have passed the Lectionary Bill—that for
revising the Prayer-Book list of Lessons. An interest-
ing theological debate arose to-night, and Lord Grey
denounced the Athanasian creed as the barbarous pro-
duct of a barbarous age. He never heard it without
horror. Lord Beat/champ, on the other hand, believed
that it was a source of comfort to thousands. Thousands
would seem to be somewhat easily, not to say oddly,
comforted.
There was an Army Scheme debate to-night, and on
other nights, and the most convenient course Mr. Punch
can adopt is to say that Mr. Gladstone tried to abbre-
viate the discussion, but that Honourable Members
would say their say, and that the end did not come until
Friday night. The Purchase Question was the great
subject of battle, because Vested Interests of all sorts
and sizes are at stake; but on the other hand it was
necessary to get this part of the question out of the way,
because the Government declare that nothing can be
done in the way of real Reform until, as the Times
succinctly puts it, "the Army shall be taken out of
Pawn." Its gallant Uncles are its officers.
Mr. Cardwell explained, on a later night, that ho
had asked for only such legislation as was wanted, that
organisation was a matter of detail, which demanded
general authorisation, not special enactment; that none
of the useful suggestions of any speaker had been over-
looked, and that the Scheme would be found, when
worked out, to be all that was required by the nation.
"He couldn't speak Pharaoh," as Thomas Hood wrote,
but we shall see, we shall see, we shall see—to dismiss the
matter in true Philistine style. Mr. Disraeli spoke,
gave the Government credit for the best intentions, and
virtually conceded the Purchase Question, so that there
was not much for Mr. Gladstone to say in reply, Colonel
Loyd-Lindsay's amendment was negatived, and the
Army Bill was read a Second Time amid loud Liberal
cheers. They may, perhaps, not be quite so loud after
some of the divisions in the Future.
Tuesday. The friends of Convocation, if it has any,
may as well be informed that the Lords struck out of the
Lectionary Bill the recognition of the clerical Parliament.
Mr. Stansfield, the new President of the Poor Law
Board, having been re-elected for Halifax, without
opposition, took his seat amid cheers from both sides.
Liking him, Mr. Punch (who like Themistocles, has a
talent for helping his friends) makes record of a fact
which in the case of anybody he didn't care about he
should have left unnoticed. Frankness is Mr. Punch's
forte. His contemporaries puff their friends just as nobly,
but do not state the reason for their advertisements.
There is a fine zoological collection at the India Offiee
Museum, but it is not of the least use, being " boxed up."
Mr. Grant Duff said something about its being "partly
accessible" to the scientific world.but there was certainly
no proxime aecessit in the case of Db. Sclater, tho in-
valuable secretary to the Zoological Sooiety. _ That
gentleman wanted to solve a problem in Natural History,
by research at the Indian Museum, but was told that
everything was packed away in boxes. Why not give
the collection, en bloc} to Dr. Sclater, for the Zoological
Museum. It is idiotic to hoard it up, as covetous old
ladies hoard scraps and fragments, until the moths eat
them.
Mr. Lambert generously proposed to raise the salaries
of Government officials, but as ne did not offer to do it
at his own expense, the proposal was politely declined
by the First Lord of the Treasury out of which the
money was to come.
The Postmaster General revises sundry postal charges,

the Small Parcels people, whose misoellanies are again

stamps from the publio (this is because letters with

but he is wrong on a detail. Sums "under" ten
shillings, for instance, are to go by money order for

price is two pence. So, if people wish to manifest their
sense of indignation at the absurd limit, they can take

The Trades Union Bill was read a Second Time. It is
generally approved in the House and by the public,
but the Unions complain of the olause which forbids
"molestation" and picketing," without which they
say they cannot make a Strike complete. Precisely so—
and hence the Bill will be passed in the present form, as

he had certainly signified disapproval when Mb. Ben-

Mb. Benttnck, and all became serene.

formality. The diplomatists may spare themselves all

Ere it could possibly, where will this planet be?
Should not the world's end have, Doctor prophetical,
Come four years since, but for slight exegetical
Error: and may we not shortly anticipate
That day which all things is destined to dissipate f
But if in prophecy you 're altogether out,
And. our Earth yet has a long time to weather out,
We shall in no respect any the better be

Nohow that I should redeem would have merited.
Much less will children of children of other men—
Deeply and dearly as I love my brother men,
For those grand-nephews and nieces that are to be,
Taxed ere they 're born is what I do not care to be.
Gumming, whatever we think of futurity,
Present taxation's a plague, of a surety.
Even supposed we this globe's perpetuity,
Paying the National Dent were fatuity.

REAL IRISH GRIEVANCE.
Irish Model (requested to put on rather a dilapidated costume). "The blissed Saints diriot he into this Coat, Sob!'
PAPAL INCOERUPTIBILITY.
A telegram from Berlin announces the notable fact that:—
"The Pope has refused his consent to the Prussian proposal of separating
the diocese of Alsace and Lorraine from the sees of France."
A worldly Pope in the place of his Holiness would have acceded
to that proposal in order to curry favour with the Emperor of
Germany. TJut even though Kaiseb Wilhelm should offer to dis-
unite Rome from Italy, and replace the Sovereign Pontiff on his
temporal throne if he would oonsent to separate Alsace and Lorraine
from the Frenoh sees, no doubt the reply of Pio Nono would still be
Non possum m. And perhaps Antonelli would advise him to
persist in saying bo.
A SEVERE STATE SURGEON.
The principle on whioh, last year, Mb. Robebt Lowe professed
to construct his Budget, was that of making everybody a little un-
oomfortable. It is to be feared that his forthcoming financial
. arrangement will be based on the same principle, with the aggrava-
tion of being made very uncomfortable to everybody. The Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer is a State Surgeon, who does not put
the patients on whom he operates under chloroform. His practice
is anesthetic in the opposite way, directed, when he reduces taxa-
tion, so to reduce it that they whose burdens are lightened by the
reduotion shall not feel it. But who will thank you, Robebt, for
the relief of which you take oare that nobody shall be sensible?
Another New Title.
"Daybreak in Spain." Why select this particular period of the
day as the subjeot of a book? and why, further, go to Spain for a
voluminous description of it P Is the early morn more striking in
that country than in Italy, or the Tropics, or on Mont Blanc, or
NottingHill?
EXCEPTIONAL SON-IN-LAW.
Happy the man who, when he takes a bride,
Espouses her alone, and none beside:
And doth not find, as many husbands do,
That he has married her relations, too.
Let him that needs must wed seleot a wife
Whose parents, both, departed have this life.
Her sole regard that he may comprehend,
Andprove the else friendless orphan's only friend.
What mortal ever yet the husband saw
Blest in the Mother he acquired by law P
Exceptions to all rules in time are born—
Long live thy Mother-in-law, Lord op Loene!
SAD OCCURRENCE.
Me. Punch.—I am sure you have a great respect for age. I am
sure you would wish the old to enjoy their well-earned rest and
repose in unmolested tranquillity, to take their nap and their doze
and their sleep without any disturbance or interruption; to be
allowed even to be stertorous without question or remonstrance. I
feel a moral certainty, therefore, that you will share my indignation,
when you hear that in my neighbourhood we have lately witnessed
the public scandal of a sale by open Auotion of no less than
"three thousand old sleepers." Poor dears! But I cannot trust
myself to write further. I can only invoke your powerful aid to
prevent the recurrence of such an outrage on all the best feelings
of our Ascidian Nature.

EVENINGS FROM HOME.

otaltt Theatre.—
Passing through
"The Elegantly
Appointed Sa-
loons" (vide New
Royalty playhill—
no, we beg pardon,
"Programme ") we
find ourselves in
the Auditorium,
where the prices
range from six-
pence to two gui-
neas, and all is
velvet, lace, young
women in waiting,
Rimmel's per-
(with advertise-
ments of lime-juice,
glycerine, and
"photochrome "),
apples, oranges,
ginger-beer (as
Nectar for the
Gods"), and "Re-
freshments of the
finest quality" for
those who are in-
clined to take advantage of the minutes allowed between the Acts.
Time 8-30.—Piece, "An OrigAial Comedy in Three Acts, entitled—
BEHIND A MASK."
Our Scene, before the Curtain; the Auditorium generally, Stalls in
particular. On tlie Stage the Scene of Act I. is supposed to
represent "Behind the Scenes of the T.R. Pevensey-super-
Mare."
Young Gentleman enters Stalls late, joins his party. Greetings. He
settles down after the usual difficulties with his lutt.
Elderly Gentleman, with Young Lady, enters elegantly-appointed
Saloon. Elegantly-appointed Female Attendant appears from
another elegantly-appointed Saloon somewhere.
Elegantly-appointed Syren (courteously suggesting). The lady
would like to leave her cloak
[ Young Lady hesitates, not being sure what is the correct thing
to do.
Elderly Gentleman (probably Uncle). No—no, never mind.
[Foresees saving sixpence. He proceeds, ticket in hand, with an
undaunted air,
Elegantly-appointed Male Box-keeper (suddenly appearing from
ehind some elegantly-appointed curtains, and addressing Elderly
Gentleman authoritatively), Leave your coat and 'at, Sir?
Elderly Gentleman, (who would sooner die than yield these articles,
sternly). No, I'll—um—I'll (as if giving expression to a brilliant
idea)—I '11 take 'em with me.
[Flatters himself on having "shut up" the elegantly appointed
one, and on having again saved sixpence. Shows ticket
defiantly, while Young Lady is half afraid that in conse-
quence of her Uncle's abrupt manner, he'll be refused ad-
mittance out of spite. They are, however, handed over to the
care of another elegantly-appointed Syren, dressed some-
what in the style of the pert lady's maid only seen in farces,
who shows them into the Stalls.
Niece (thoughtfully). We shall want a
Syren (sweetly). Programme? (Hands one.)
Uncle (pretending not to notice this—another sixpence saved).
Where are our Stalls? (They are pointed out to him. He begins to
feel hot. Wishes he'd left his coat. Stoops to put his hat under the
seat. Comes up again purple with the exertion.) Very awkward
these (kicks his hat, and dives again. Reappears very much
exhausted, after staving in one side of his hat. Wishes he'd left it,
with his coat.)
Friend behind him (recognising him). Hallo! You here!
Uncle (puffing, and unable to deny the fact). Tes. (Apologetically)
I've brought my niece. Let me introduce
[Introduces Friend at back to Niece at his side. Niece inclines
her head at an acute angle, and sees as much of her Uncle's
Friend as she can conveniently take in witli her left eye.
Uncle, in this operation, feels that his white tie (which he
won't and can't pin without using bad language) has wrig-
gled round. Both wish that Friend was sitting in front
instead of behind. Original Comedy has in the meantime
progressed.
Intricate and complicated plot of Act I. Miss Josephine Belling-
ham—pretty name by the way—elopes with Algernon Pebctval,
—another very pretty name—in order to become Mbs. Algernon
Perctval, or Mrs. Pebmval, as the case may be. That's all.
Lounger (coming in late and joining Party in Stalls). What's this?
His Friend (briefly). First Act.
Lounger. Ah! (looks about). Anything been done, eh?
His Friend (much interested in the piece). No, nothing particular.
Joe Attwood (a prompter, capitally made up and very carefully
played by Mr. Flockton). Yes, Governor (to Mr. Bellingham, the
manager), our Joey (meaning Miss Jos. Bellingham) is, &c., &c.
Man (who knows something about theatricals, in Stalls). What's
the prompter supposed to be doing?
Amateur Friend. Don't know. (Brilliantly) Prompting, I sup-
pose. Doesn't seem like it, though.
Lady Vaguely (in Private Box to the Honourable Charles, her
friend, in attendance). It reminds me of—dear me—what's that
piece in which Alfred Wig an, you know, and his daughter
Hon. Charles (exercising his memory). Ah—yes—"The"—um—
(thinks he's got the name, but hasn't)—"The"—um—no—(corrects
himself)—not " Still Waters,"—no— [They both think it over.
Deeply-interested Swell (in another Private Box, leaning with his
back towards the Stage). I say, old boy—(to dinner companion)—
what a bore it is not being able to smoke at a theatre.
Second Swell (also deeply interested). Ya-as. (Yawns.) S'posewe
go to Alhambra f Deuced good band there, first-rate. 'Pomysoul
(he means to say " 'Pon my soul"), best place for evening—in a box,
of course.
First Swell. Ya-as.
Enter on Stage Captain Chefney Challoner, well played by
Mr. 0. Summees, and excellently " made up."
Lady Vaguely (suddenly). 0, I know—(taps Hon. Charles with
her fan)— The First Night"—that was the name of the piece.
Hon. Charles. Yes: of course, behind the scenes.
Second Swell (condescending to attend for a few minutes). That
fellow's not so bad, is he? He's dressed deuced well.
[He alludes to Mr. Bishop, who is an admirable exponent of the
Hon. Tim Whiffler. Mr. Bishop is certainly one of the
best (and we have very few) " Young Men" on the Stage.
Captain Chifney (on Stage, speaking in a deep voice). Aw—ya-as
—doosid good—haw—haw.
Critical Habitue (in Stalls). Rather like Bancroft in Ourt.
Lady Habitue. Yes: but it 'b the same sort of character.
Josephine (on Stage, to her parent in a plum-coloured coat). Kiss
me, father—kiss me—say that vou—(He kisses her. Recollection
of Scene in "David Copperfleld, where Emily, on the night of her
intended elopement with Steehforth, asks Pegotty to kiss her, and
pardon her if she has ever caused him any sorrow, fyc, fyc.—Ahem .'
—Josephine continuing). Kiss me, father—(he does so, she clings to
him)—say that you—that you—(Her father twinkles his eyes, purses
up his mouth, smacks his lips, somewhat after the manner of the late
Mr. Harley or the present Mr. Compton)—that you—(Struggles
with her feelings, whatever they may be, still guided by Little
Em'ly)—That you—booh-hoo-hoo!
[Her feelings being too much for her, she gives way, and is led
off by an elderly matron.
Amateur in Stall. Mr. Algernon Percival will have a pleasant
elopement, if that's how she's going on.
Act progresses. Mr. Bellingham (Peggotty) receives a note from
Josephine (Emily) to say she's gone. Joe (Ham) reads it to
him. End of Act.
Niece (to Uncle, in Stalls, answering friend behind). Yes, it's—
it's pretty.
Friend behind. Your Uncle seems greatly interested.
Niece. Yes, I must wake him; he always sleeps at a theatre.
[Wakes her Uncle, who blinks for a few seconds and then refers
to his watch.
ACT II.
Private Theatricals at Feltham Hall.
Mrs. Percival (formerly Josey Bellingham). I '11 put you all right.
[I'akes manuscript and makes herself generally useful, and par-
ticularly disagreeable.
Lady Vaguely (in Private Box to Hon. Charles). I don't think she
would be invited again. [Hon. Charles simpers.

and playing Honourable Tom Whiffler, at in Act L, capitally).
Ya-as, he is deuced -well dressed. Only—(horrified)—look—
Second Swell (equally horrified). Some one ought to tell him not
to wear white stockings in evening dress with low shoes. Looks
horrid bad.
PLOT OF ACT II.
Mrs. Perctval reheartet a part in which she has to say, " O, my
father, do we meet again f " or words to that effect
Clever Habitue" (languidly). Bet she meets her father.
Everybody (everywhere in theatre). 0, of course.
[ and, strange to say (dear me, how curiously things do
come about, to be sure!) she positively rushes into her
father's arms, who has come in erening dress to superintend
professionally t/te rehearsal. So new, you know, and takes
you so by surprise!
ACT III.
Lodgings by the Sea-side. About four years after Act IT., judging
that is from the size of the child, Algernon Percival, Junior,
who is brought in at the finish on the Mrs. Torpey principle, in
order to excite the compassion of the audience.

gone crazy with grief owing to the disappearance o/Mr. PERCIVAL.)

People generally. Ah! why didn't he P
[General dissatisfaction with Percival's conduct.
Joe Attwood (to Mrs. Dcrdham, the Matron). Don't persevere,
Mum. (She cries.) Don't persevere, Mum. (She does something
else.) Don't persevere, Mum. (This being said at intervals for
about a dozen times, gets laughed at occasionally.)
Critical Habitue". Perhaps that's what he '11 say to the author:
"Don't persevere, Sir."
Enter Joset "off her chump," mad as Tilburina, in white muslin.
Mr. Algernon Percival returns.
Algernon Percival. When she sees me she '11 be pleased.
[ Will she? He is dressed in black frock coat and trousers,
frilled shirt, and purple gloves, being in mourning for his
father, whose illness has taken him away, and caused his
wife's madness. O, isn't it simple and pretty, and O, so
natural, and O, so probable, and O, so affecting!
Critical Person in Pit (who hasn't been a playgoer all his life for
nothing). I say (to his companion) do you see that there planner in
the corner? Well, you '11 see if some one don't go and play her a
tune which she heard before, as a child, or somewhere a long time
ago, and then she '11 wake up all of a sudden like, and the young
cove '11 call out to her, and she '11 come round all square, and tumble
into his arms. See if she don't. (And so she does?)
His Friend (admiringly). You was right. You see'd it afore.
Critical Pittite (winking). Know it off the reel. Lor^ bless yer,
it's the reg'lar tiling. Come along!

SONGS OF SIXPENCE.
THE SONG OF THE BOLD TAR.
Come listen to this Jolly Old Tar,
And the time he will beguile
Not in tittle tattle.
But a-telling of a battle,
Of the famous battle of the Nile,
My boys! my boys!
Of the famous battle of the Nile.
Chorus, if you please.
At the battle of Nile
1 was there all the while,
At the battle of the Nile
/ was there!
'Twas past three bells when the en'my's sail
Hove in sight of our larboard bow;
Our supper cried—
I was standing by his side,
But—his words I've forgotten now,
My boys! my boys!
His words I can not remember now.
We saw five thousand Frenchmen there,
At the distance of a mile;
We gave three cheers
For the gay Mounseers
Who were sailing so bravely up the Nile,
My boys! my boys!
All a-sailing bravely up the Nile.
All hands to breakfast had just been piped,
And the kettle began to bile,
When a shot went a whizzin'
Through the main-gallant-mizen—
'Twas the first at the battle of the Nile,
My boys! my boys!
'Twas the first at the battle ot the Nile.
Our Admiral he were in his dish-o'bill,
But he dashed on his cocked tile:
'Twas lion-hearted Nelson,
And he hadn't nothing else on,
On the morn of the battle of the Nile,
My boyB! my boys!
On the morn of the battle of the Nile.
[Authentic Chorus as before.
A British Seaman's brave and true,
At all dangers he will smile;
And a sailor may be bold,
Though he stops down in the hold
All the time of the battle of the Nile.
My boys! my boys!
All the time of the battle of the Nile.
A Tar must go wherever duty calls,
Though to face a crocodile,
O, 'twas hard that a cold
Confined me to the hold
On the day of the battle of the Nile,
My boys! my boys!
All the day of the battle of the Nile.
The cannons began to rage and to roar,
And where was this Tar meanwhile r
Aye! this brave heart beat
Neath a blanket and sheet
In my berth at the battle of the Nile.
My boys! my boys!
Influenza at the battle of the Nile.
'Twas done! we'd won! they slept! I crept
Out of berth, sheets and blanket a-pile,
And jumped into the river
'Twas a bad thing for my liver,
To tell of the battle of the Nile,
My boys! my boys!
To be first with the battle of the Nile.
Once more I stood on England's shore
On the shore of our own dear Isle
I've lived a long time in it
But never till this minute
Have I sung of the battle of the Nile,
My boys! my boys!
Have I sung of the battle of the Nile.
But—(heroic chorus.)
At the battle of the Nile
I was there all the while
At the battle of the Nile
/was there!!
Royal Development.
Talk of the law of Natural Selection, we are all glad to see it
allowed to govern the marriage of a British Princess with the heir of
a British Peer. This is a great improvement on the rule of non-
natural selection by which German husbands have hitherto been
wont to be ohosen for our Royal spinsters. Happily, too, Natural
Selection, in the present instance, will not be accompanied by
Struggle for Existence.
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
A precaution, suggested by the late panic with respect to an
exanthematous complaint, has suggested, in some quarters, the
inquiry whether there is any peculiar process appointed by the
Faculty for the Vaccination of suoh as are of riper years.

PUNCH'S PROTHALAMION.
(On the Etpousah of the Pbincess Louise and the Lord of Lobne,
March 21, 1871.)
Mad March, that lion-like brcak'st on the year,
Be lamb-like for Louise, who weds to-day:
Or, if thy wild winds needs must pipe and play,
Be it blithe wedding inarch, and chorus clear.
And if thy dust appear,
Be't that gold dust of thine, whereof they say
A peek of it is ransom for a king,
Which on her golden head for guerdon lay,
Crowning her new life with the smile of spring,
While pairing birds shall sing
The song that best befits a marriage morn—
And with thy softest green the boughs adorn,
And woo forth from its bud each sweetest flower,
That all Earth's fairest firstlings may be born
To deck the bridal bower,
And grace this rosy hour.
And thou, by Windsor's walls, thine elms among,
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.*
This is no common day, e'en among days
Of princely wedlock: when our Windsor rose
Bohily the pale of Royalty o'ergrows;
Beyond that old ring-fence shoots venturous sprays;
Like a free field-flower strays,
And—Rote d'Amour—save Love's no lordship knows!
Cupid, that laughs at locksmiths, laughs at ties
Fast knotted out of Royalty's red-tape,
* Mr. Punch presents his thanks to JIastbr Edmund Spenser for the
loan of this line.
And under a wise mother's guardian eyes,
By the heart's right o'er the hand's destinies,
Makes Law help Love's escape.
Then boldly leap, Louise; and, lusty Lobne,
Show how a dear load may be lightly borne,
Though weighted with a princely coronet—
He that would win the rose must brave the thorn 1
Envy's the winner's debt—
Blithely this flowret set
Beside thy eagle plume, and wear it long—
And Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
"Let royal blood but with blood royal blend,
Lest crowned heads out of subjects' reverence fall,
Or subjects, with the throne for pedestal,
For dangerous and dizzying heights contend."
So Fools the time would mend,
And on the dial back the hands would call,
And have things still to be as they have been,
Keeping the Future to the Past in thrall:
But while they mouth their cues, Time shifts the scene,
And cast, from Clown to Queen;
Old properties, old phrases pass away,
And lo, new actions move, new actors play!
Such change of scene is here, where Youth and Love
Take parts they seldom in Court-shows essay,
The varnished mask remove,
And doff the glace" glove,
For Youth's true face, and Love's clasp warm and long-
Sweet Thames, flow softly, till I end my song!

To match the Guelf's for long-descended fame,
Since William's niece the Gillie Callum won,
And left a Norman son,
To mask Mac Diarmid's under Beauchamp's name.
The while Lochow, at blood-feud still with Lorne,
Reaped the red harvest sowed by sword and flame,
Till to Kilchrenan Catlean Mob was borne,
While the Mac Douqall's pibroch skirled in scorn.
And Campbell's tree took root, ,
And grew so great of girth, so flush of fruit,
Its arms Lorne s land and lordship shadowed o'er,
And what strength spared was won by wooer's suit,
Till, by Mac Diarmid's boar,
Argyll Lorne's galley wore—
No prouder coat, St. George's flags among!
Sweet Thames! run softly till I end my song.
A Royal Maid's white palm ere now was laid
In a red Campbell's. Was not stout Sir Neil,*
For service done at need by sleight and steel,
With Brtjce's sister's hand by Bruce repaid,
When kings thanked subject's blade?
So of mesalliance needs no dread to feel,
Believers in blue blood and blazon's power;
Lorne boasts all rights that pedigrees reveal
To counterpoise e'en his Louise's dower;
And,—best gifts of the hour,—
He brings his youth and strength and promise fair
Of all that crowns with joy a wedded pair:
While she that blushes, blissful, at his side,
Moves to the altar, 'mid a nation's prayer
That best may her betide
Kind stars can give a bride.
Then, while those prayers move heavenward, swift and
strong,
Sweet Thames, flow softly to my nuptial song.
a long life of gain and glory, was buried at Kilchrenan, on Loch Awe, having
been alain on the Sreang of Lorne, in a foray against the Mac DougalU,
Lorda of Lome, and hereditary enemies of the Campbells, who gradually
ousted them of their lands by the sword, and completed the work by the
wedding of Colin, first Earl of Argyll (a.d. 1470) with the Lady Isabel
Stewabt, daughter and co-heiress of John, Lord Lome. It was this
Colin who thus brought into the house of Campbell the lands, title, and
arms of its ancient enemy, and so bore the galley of Lorne on his banner,
alongside the boar's head of Diarmid, the mythic ancestor of the Mac Cailban
Mob. It was Diarmid's grandson, Gillie Galium, who, going over to Nor-
mandy, before the Conquest, there married the niece of Duke William, the
Conqueror, and gave to his sons the Norman name of Bcauchamp, Latine,
Ctfmpus-bettiu, Anglice, Camp-bell.

of his good service in council and in the field, the hand of his sister, Lady

FIRST PRINCIPLE IN A PROTOCOL.
The language of diplomacy is not always that of truth. But
truer words were never written than those of the special protocol,
signed by the representatives of the Great Powers, at the first meet-
ing of the late Conference concerning the Black Sea, in which Eng-
land has triumphed so gloriously. This protocol affirms that a
Power which is party to a joint-treaty is not justified in rescinding
that Treaty without the assent of its co-signataries. The degree of
truth expressed in this proposition is fully equal to that which
Hamlet enunciated when ne said—
"There's ne'er a villain, dwelling in all Denmark,
But he's an arrant knave."
And, as Horatio, on receipt of the foregoing information, re-
marked to the giver, so we, touching that equally true protocol, may
say to Earl Granville—
"There needs no ghost, my Lord, come from the grave,
To tell us this."
It is so evidently true. Indeed, nobody ever denied it; not
Gortschakoff even, nor his master. So neither, amongst ourselves,
would any two characters known to the police, if they were in a
responsible state of mind, deny that theft, and swindling, and
robberv accompanied with violence, are utterly unjustifiable.
"But,'' the British rascals would add, grinning, "what then?"
The Victory Won.
There can no longer be any doubt that Mr. Fobster's Education
Bill is a complete success, and that the reproach of ignorance will
soon be wiped off from us as a nation. A School Board has been
elected at Ystradgunlais hower." We regretted to find that there
was no member of it bearing the name of Jones.
SABBATARIAN INFORMATION.
A text, which is to be found in text-hand copy-books, says,
"Mind your own business." This excellent injunction cannot be
more exactly obeyed than in endeavouring to enforce the Act of
Charles the Second, which prohibits Sunday Trading, against
shopkeepers who, by infringing that too commonly treated as obso-
lete statute, evince opinions as to the observance of the Sabbath
Day differing from your own. Acting on the golden rule above
quoted, as well as on that other which requires us to do as we would
be done by, the Rev. J. Bee Wright, Secretary to the Association
for the Suppression of Sunday Trading, on Thursday last week,
according to a Police Report, summoned Mr. Thomas Denver.
tobacconist, of No. 23, Queen's Road, Bayswaterj on a charge of
unlawfully exercising his worldly calling and business on the First
Day of the Week, contrary to the statute 29 of the most religious
and gracious King aforesaid, cap. 7. This grave offence having
been clearly proved, Mb. Mansfield fined the defendant in the
nominal penalty of one penny, and refused to allow the prosecution
their costs; thus treating a Society of zealous philanthropists as
though he considered them a set of meddlesome bigots, or else
Pharisaical hypocrites, who, having instituted a vexatious prose-
cution under an antiquated Act, deserved to be scouted out of
court.
It is true that the worthy Magistrate, so to call him, "granted a
case" for decision by the Court of Queen's Bench on certain
points; one of them being, "whether a Magistrate, on convicting
an offender under the Lord's Day Act, is not required, by the statute
11 and 12 Victoria, cap. 43, section 18, to award to the prosecutor
the cost of the summons that he obtained against the offender."
But suppose the Court above should confirm Mr. Mansfield's
decision, that lie was empowered to saddle the Anti-Sunday Trading
Association and its Secretary with the costs of their laudable attempt
to vindicate a pious law. In that case they will be charged with
liabilities to the amount, perhaps, of several shillings. Very likely
this will be a heavy expense to be shored by persons who, being of

mostly to the poorer classes. Should it ultimately fall on them,
subscriptions will doubtless be forthcoming to indemnify that

and his Sabbatarian employers.
NEW WAYS FOR NURSEMAIDS.
Among the arrangements of the contemplated tramways, there
ought to be one whioh would remove from the pavement of every
street a constant source of annoyance, and indeed injury, to pas-
sengers walking thereon. The perambulators propelled by gaping
maid-servants incommode people very much. They are continually
pushed in men's way, very often poked against their legs, soiling
their trousers, and not uncommonly driven over their toes, thus
crushed by the wheels of cars of baby Juggernaut. If the Police
had orders to cause these vehicles to be kept to the road for other
carriages, the nuisance which perambulators now constitute would
be abated. But nobody whose mind is largely endowed with an acute
feeling of tenderness for helpless infancy would very much like a
regulation which would occasion children, as well as nursemaids, to
be run over and squelched by vans and omnibuses, albeit for the
sake of protecting nis own corns, and bunions, and gouty lower
extremities, from contusion. Now, our own legs and feet, and the
infants of other people as well, might be alike secured against
damage of that description by a separate tramway laid down in the
carriage-way of every street for perambulators alone, which the
most vacant of servant-girls coula not help wheeling straight on,
inoffensively and out of danger. The man whose nature is rightly
constituted has a kindness for children, but likes always to see
them in their right place, where they would evidently be situated
when wheeled along on a tramway which they and their attendants
had all to themselves.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.

WHO CAN IT BE?
Mr. Punch,
In a leading article in one of the papers on
the Judgment in the Pitrchas case (nice amusement for
the next generation!) I find a reference to "Caroline
Divinity." Can you tell me who she was P I know that
the Puritans gave peculiar names to their offspring, so
that this lady may have been one of those children who
were born at that time and received the extraordinary
designations at which posterity smiles; only that I have
no recollection of Caroline being amongst the names
favoured by the grim Anabaptists and Independents.
Perhaps, however, you may have made acquaintance
with "Caroline Divinity" in your voluminous
reading: if so, a reference will greatly oblige a
PUZZLE-TATE.
HUMILITY IN TRIUMPH.
Their conquered foe the Germans made
Under no Caudine yoke to march;
But they themselves tramped, calm and staid,
Beneath that foe's Triumphal Arch.
Therein did they forbearance show,
And let all Europe see they knew
The honour to a noble, though
Aggressive nation, which was due.
Gaol-Bird. Guests.
IRREVOCABLE.
Customer (for the Royal Wedding photograph). "Can't I have tite Lady only?
I DON'T SO MUCH WANT THE GENTLEMAN!!"
Young Person {with decision). "No, Sir; we can't Part them, Sir, now I"
According to the Times, " the released Fenian prisoners
continue to be treated almost as national guests in the
United States." Many of our American well-wishers, in
the excess of their amity towards us, perhaps, have invited
some of those patriots to their domestic board; but now
repent that they carried their enthusiasm so far—having
lost spoons.
Clerical Error.
"High" Parsons would have couples tarry
When they propose to wed in Lent—
But why? The sooner people marry,
The sooner, mostly, they repent.
PUNCH'S FOLK-LORE.
ST. PATRICK'8 DAY.
The season of Spring gives us lamb and violets, salmon and patron
Saints. St. David and St. Patrick are commemorated in March,
St. George only waits until April. (Of this last-named Saint a very
careful notice has for some time been in preparation, to include six
autobiographical anecdotes of his boyish days, a selection from his
unpublished correspondence with his laundress, and an authentic
portrait of his chief antagonist—the Dragon.)
St. Patrick's Day! The heart leaps up with uncontrolled delight,
and a flood of popular airs comes rushing o'er the brain. What
reminiscences of Dye-gone days invade the territory of the mind!
All the population of Dublin, headed by the Lord-Lieutenant and
Ulster King-at-Arms, abroad at daybreak, looking for four-leaved
shamrocks in the Phoenix Park, and singing Moore's Melodies in
unison; an agreeable mixture of whiskey and water provided in un-
limited quantities in every market town in Ireland, the expense of
the water being defrayed out of the Consolidated Fund; the Lord
Mayor of Dublin presented with a new shillelagh of polished oak,
bound with brass, purchased by the united contributions of every
grown-up citizen bearing the name of Patrick; the Constabulary
in new boots; a public dinner on the Blarney Stone, and a fancy-
dress ball on the Wicklow Mountains! These are but a few of the
marks of distinction showered on this memorable day by Erin's
grateful sons and daughters, who owe to St. Patrick two of the
greatest distinctions that ever befel them—freedom from serpents,
snakes, scorpions, efts, newts, tadpoles, chameleons, salamanders,
daddy-long-legs, and all other venomous reptiles, and instruction
in six lessons, in "the true art of mixing their liquor, an art," it
has been well observed, "which has never since been lost."
This leaning of the Saint to potheen is viewed, however, by
one section of the community with manifest displeasure—the
Temperance and Teetotal Societies—who remain indoors the whole
of the day with the blinds closely drawn down and straw in front of
their houses, and employ paid emissaries to distribute tracts amongst
their excitable countrymen.
The notorious fact that St. Patrick lived to be considerably more
than a hundred, cut a wisdom tooth at ninety-eight, never had a
day's illness in his life, was possessed of funded property, and could
see to read without spectacles until within six weeks of his untimely
end (caused by a fall from a cherry-tree), speaks libraries for the
tonic and salubrious qualities of that stimulating spirit, which has
ever since his day been known and highly appreciated under the
name of " L.L.," or Long Livers' Whiskey.
A curious custom is kept up by the Knights of the Order of St.
Patrick (founded by King Brian Boroo the ForrRTEENni) on the
morning of this day, the origin of which is lost among the wilds of
Connemara. Before it is light the Knights aU go up in their robes and
shamrocks, one by one, into the belfry of the Cathedral, and toll the
great bell one hundred and twenty-three times, the exact number
of years to which the Saint, in forgetfulness of Sir George Corn-
wall Lewis and the Editor of Notes and Queries, is said to have
attained. They then parade the principal streets of Dublin on pie-
bald horses, preceded by a band of music and the Law Officers of the
Crown, and disperse at a moment's notice, no one knows where.
St. Patrick's tastes were athletic. He had a wart on his forehead,
and a cousin in the militia; and displayed a profound acquaintance
with the laws of short whist, then in its infancy. He was an early
riser, a deep thinker, and a careless dresser, and foresaw, with an
eagle glance, the gradual development of the Railway System, while
his declining years were soothed by the devoted attentions of some
of the oldest families in Ireland.
Reflection in a Quiet Street.
Two classes of persons may bo said to be "music-mad,"—those
who are mad after music, and those (tho far greater number) who
are every day driven mad by music (!) from street-bands, street-
niggers, street-organs, and street-singers of all descriptions.

A HIGH JOKE IN SPAIN.
The Times remarks that when the Marquis be MrRAFLORES,
addressing the Spanish Senate, said. "I ask the Senate to pass a
Bill that shall put an end to all revolutions," his words " convulsed
the House with laughter." Naturally. The Spanish Senate laughed
as heartily as the British House of Lords would laugh if some noble
Peer were to request their Lordships to pass a Bill that would
initiate a series of revolutions. Perhaps if M. Thiers were to talk
to the French National Assembly about legislation that should put
a stop to revolutions, he would be laughed at by his hearers equally
with the Marquis de Miraflores. Revolutions in France, as well
as Spain, constitute, as Mr. O'Brallagiian says, the natural order
of things.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

DOLTS OF DOVER.
irs, —Mr. Punch has been
much ill-treated in this
Dover business. He speaks
of "this Dover business"
without explanation, for,
thanks to his contempo-
raries, allthe civilised world
is aware that by a majority
of 15 to 13 it has been de-
cided that Punch shall not
be taken in by the Dover
Young Men's Christian
Association. He could,
perhaps, bear that, with
the fortitude furnished by
philosophy, but his griev-
ance is that the Dolts
of Dover committed their
crime against sense at a date
which afforded all his news-
paper friends an oppor-
tunity of so demolishing
the unhappy criminals that
little is left for Mr. Punch
to do, except to make his
best bow to his faithful
Allies. Dean Swift ob-
serves that one doesn't
throw water on drowned
rats.
However, he has a word
or two more to say. First
one with His Worship, Mr.
E. Knocker, at present Mayor of Dover. This personage is stated,
in the report of the meeting at which the above amazing decision
was arrived at, to have abused Punch,
"Believing it to be a publication contemptuous of Religious Influences, if
not absolutely hostile to them."
Unhappy Dover, unhappy Mayor! Over head and cars tumbleth
his Worship at the first word. Why does he "believe" anything
about the character of a publication, when it is open before him,
and, if he can read it, he can " know what it contains. But per-
haps Mr. Knocker's modesty suggested the word—he is not a brass
knocker—and he only ventures to believe that he understands
Punch. Well, he does not, but we forgive that. But then Mr.
Knocker, like the scandal-monger in the play, says, "Ab we know
nothing about it, let us believe the worst."
"Religious Influences " is a phrase belonging to a certain class of
Christians, among whom arc thousands of the best people in Eng-
land. Therefore Mr. Punch will not (and certainly not on the
provocation of such a very weak vessel as poor Mr. Knocker) depart
from his thirty years' rule of never chastising folly in a way that
may offend piety. He therefore merely remarks that when Mr.
Knocker (a "serious attorney") will leave off "believing," and
will point out one paragraph or picture, in all Mr. Punch's volumes,
which evinces contempt of Religious Influences, Mr. Punch will
make the amplest amends.
But a gentleman—(we would say a Christian, but for being
adjudged unworthy company for the young Christians of Dover) always
supposes the best, as long as he can. Mr. Punch supposes that
Mr. Knocker is a dismal person. He is to be pitied for this. If he
thinks that Nature made a mistake in supplying us with a machinery
for smiling and laughing, or that it is a sin to use that machinery,
we can but deplore the profanity that criticises Nature, and wish
that Mr. Knocker may some day abate his presumption. And we
have done with him when we have conferred on him our Royal
Licence to change his name—by altering one letter.
In a book by an author whose name he may have heard—nay,
seen, for he must have visited Westminster Abbey—Mr. Knocker
will find this passage. It will serve for a motto which he should
cause to be printed, with a black border, and hung up by a black
cord in the reading-room of his Christian young men.
Waspe. Why do you laugh, Sir?
Quarlous. Sir, you'll allow mc my Christian liberty,
laugh, I hope?
Knockkm. Nay, in some sort, Sir, he may neither laugh
hope in this Company.
I may
Of Mr. Mayor Knockem, whose ideas of the conduct befitting
young Christians are thus crystallised, Mr. Punch takes leave—
with the sensation experienced on coming out of the shop of a highly
respectable undertaker.
But now, Mr. Mowll (why the initial and final P), one word with
you. We are apprised by the report that you
"—took up pretty much the same ground as the Mayor had occupied,
and triumphantly producing a back number of Punch, containing a humorous
illustration of an old lady imparting to a sympathising friend the fact tb.it,
although she permitted Jemima, the cook, to go to chapel three times a-day,
she discharged her duties in the kitchen no better, arguing that this was a
Sneer at Religion."
0, Mowll, Mowll! We cannot be serious with you. From one
or two things your Mayor said (we have hinted why we do not touch
on them), we believe that his dismalness is respectable, and we have
respectfully castigated it. But you must be simply stupid. With
that picture staring you in the face, and with the meaning palpable,
you detect a Sneer at Religion. It would be wrong to flagellate you!
Poor Mr. Mowll. Please take from Mr. Punch the assurance that
the meaning of the picture was the exact reverse of what you
imagined. Are you sure that your name isn't Mole? Then it
ought to be. But if you are quite sure that it isn't, why—off to
vour Thistles.
But what of Dover? What of its Young Christians? What of
people who can choose such Rulers and can submit to them? We
suppose that they suit Dover, and the next deduction is that Dover
must be a place of Dolts. Well, (here interposing our Royal
acknowledgments to the Rev. H. P. Htjohes, who exposed the
absurdity of the Mayor and President, and to the 12 others, who
"voted Punch") we apprise Dover that its unhappy dulness shall
be respected and tenderly cared for. Our pictures shall henceforth
be explained (in foot note or otherwise) for the instruction of Dover,
and as the Essex Calf has been improved into average sense, Punch
hopes that years of cultivation may elevate the Dover Dolt.

A DISAPPOINTMENT.
"rjlO SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTES.—A
Member of the Mathe-
matical Society will be happy to deliver SIX LECTURES on the
Poetry of Motion"
Very pleased to find that learning can unbend and disport itself
on such a fascinating subject as Dancing, for which, of course, " the
Poetry of Motion" is only a graceful euphuism—
"being introductory to the study of Euclid, Trigonometry, and the
Higher Plane Curves."
Very puzzled to think what the connection can possibly be between
the Waltz, the Quadrille, and the pas seul, and Euclid, Trigono-
metry, and the Higher Plane Curves;" and fear we are altogether
mistaken in our notion of the lecturer's benevolent design.
HARROWING.
Dear Mr. Punch,
This joke is mine, and I have been looking at it until I
quite admire it:—
"Anna virumque cano," says the poet; "Amxa virusque cano,"
say the Harrow boys when they are licked for refusing to be
vaccinated.
That's good, though I say it that shouldn't. Yours respectfully,

lowed by illumina-

at night, on the
occasion of the Ox-
ford and Cambridge
Boat-race. All the public offices, Banks, Baths and Washhouses,
and other places of business were closed, and everybody went down
to the banks of the Thames, from the peer in his robes, to the artisan
in his blouse.
Mr. Punch witnessed the Oxford and Cambridge Boat-race from
his private Trireme (painted dark and light blue in alternate layers,
to show his rigid impartiality), with a blue " Peter " flying from the
mast-head. He was escorted to the place of embarkation by a
troop of the Blues.
"Where to spend a happy day?" In an elegant carriage, in
elegant attire, with elegant ladies, and an elegant luncheon, survey-
ing the glories of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat-race.
When Mr. Toole returned from the Oxford and Cambridge Boat-

ledged that now
at last he was
"happy."
The reproach that

tached to the first

Neverout (who enters). Here he is. "And vet I am not happy."
[This was a bit of Stage wit of the period.
Colonel. You don't look happy, old man. What's the trouble?
Neverout. 0, not much, les, I '11 have some tea. You were not
at Patti last night, Lady Smart.
Lady Smart. Which I weren't. (All laugh.)
Neverout. Sorry for you. You missed a treat.
Lady Smart. I know I did. She is awfully good in Amina.
But Lord Smart insisted on my going down to the House, and some-
times one has to be obedient.
Neverout. I suppose so. But I didn't mean Path, but your hand-
same and meritorious neighbour, four boxes ofl'.
Lord Sparkish. Yes, now you mention it, I heard of that at the
One o'Clock, but it went right out of my head. Tell us.
Neverout. Well, you know, I don't say it isn't awfully hard on
poor old Bertie, who is no end of a good fellah, and all that. But
then he's old enough to know. Anyhow, he had been dining, -and
we 'U suppose the wine was bad, and his grievances came strong
upon him. However, it's to be kept out of the papers, if they can.
Miss (laughing). The most lucid narrative I ever heard. I wish
you'd write novels.
Tjord Sparkish. Row '11 be final, suppose?
Neverout. Must, this time, I should say. Mind was much too
freely spoken on both sides.
Colonel. And on the third?
Neverout. Well, you see, the third hadn't much'chance of being
oratorical, having, at an early stage of the debate, been spun right
out of the box. It's a fact. "Little Bobby Lardner saw the exit.
I'm awfully sorry, you know, and I hate talking about it.
Miss. Very much. We are all sure of that.
Neverout. Now don't chaff a fellah. We don't say sharp things
now-a-days, you know. All very well in the time of Queen Anne.
Miss. When was that? I will bet you half-a-dozen pair of
gloves you can't tell the date within twenty years.
Neverout. Thank you. I haven't got to get my living by a com-
petitive examination. Ask that Colonel; they 're going to educate
the soldiery, don't you know.
Colonel (coldly). That's chaff, if you like, and not in the best taste
neither. (Recovers his good temper.) No, I don't say that, but the
idea of education is revolting to my finer feelings. (Laughs.)
Miss. All very well, but I am covetous of gloves. I want to
know what made Mr. Neverout speak of Queen Anne?
Neverout. Well, I saw a book on a fellah's table, and it was called
Polite Conversation, as talked by our great grandmothers, and I
give you my word they all snapped at one another like fish-fags.
And weren't they vulgar, just?
Lady Sparkish. Tastes alter. But tell me, were they stupid?
Neverout. Why, no, not that. They all tried to talk like a comedy,
don't vou know; wit, and all that. Some of the things made me
roar, out they wouldn't do now, you see. By the way, we 're to
have Schneider again and the Grande Buchesse.
All. a, that's delightful!

MY HEALTH.
My Aunt is of opi-
nion that I shall
he the better for my
journey to Rams-
gate: this she says
before starting, at
the Railway Station.
I never knew any
two people so diffi-
cult to find as my
Aunt and her maid,
or any things so
difficult to keep in
one place as my
Aunt's and her
maid's packages.
Of course
an altercation with
the Cabman in con-
sequence of ffie
number of parcels
outside, in which he
has the best of it), I
have to take their
tickets and look
after the higgaee.
It requires a con-
siderable amount of
"looking after." I
ime to step into a waiting-room: from that
the greatest trouble in what I may term
labelled, and arranging for one porter to
carry om wraps, rugs—we] have as many as if we were going on aa
Arctic expedition—and umbrellas, and entrusting another porter
with the tnrtle-dove in its wicker cage, I go in search of ray Aunt.
Into one waiting-room—no. Somebody very like her, but that
won't do.
Into anotherwaiting-room—no. Odd. Perhaps the refreshment-
room—no. Ah, there's Doddridge, her maid, by the bookstall.
Doddridge has known me from infancy, and calls me Master
George. She is a trifle more eheerful than my Aunt, there being,
perhaps, just one smile to choose between them. You never know
when either of them is going to cry. There are some subjects of
conversation which,if anybody touches upon ever so lightly, set them
off one after the other, as if by mechanism. Doddridge's sorrow is the
memory of her great-grandfather, whom she supported for years
(she's a kind soul) until there was nothing left to support, except
his loss, which appears to be still (and it happened twenty years
ago at least), insupportable.
Mem (always to be borne m mind in talking with Doddridge).
Never mention any great grandfather. Ignore such a being.
My Aunt has a secret sorrow. There s the difficulty with her.
No one can tell why she chooses to dress like a Lady Abbess (with
modifications). No one can tell why she invariably retires for two
hours during the afternoon, and will be at home to no one.
You can avoid the pit-fall of Doddridge's grief, but you "can't do
the same with my Aunt's. You may step down on it suddenly if
you 're treading (conversationally) ever so lightly, and then—squish!
—out come the tears, not noisily, but with sufficient force to give
you such a shock as you'd have if you'd pulled a shower-bath
string, when you thought there was nothing in and .the top turned
out to be full.
You never knew of what subject to steer clear with her. And
then, when she cries, it is most embarrassing; she weeps with her
eyes wide open, not blinking for a second, and she never has a pocket
handkerchief to hand when wanted. Ji my Aunt is up-stairs, her
pocket-handkerchief is down-stairs, and vice versd.
I find Doddridge at the Stall. "Where is my Aunt? "Lor,
Master George," says this excellent woman, "how should I know?
What with the bustle,, and the whistling, and things going about, I
really can't see no one nowhere, and where your Aunt has gone.
Master George, is a misery" (she means "mystery ") "to me." I
point to a waiting-room and tell her to go in there. She continues,
"and then, Master George, there's poor Charlie (the King Charles,
now in her arms, turning up bis nose at me, and showing his
teeth), I must take him with me in the carriage. Lor', if he was
to go in.the luggage place, or if I was to part company with him,
Missus would never forgive me, for she says, just before you left us,
says she,"—
—I pretend to see my Aunt in the distance and leave Doddridge.
I find my Aunt at last, slowly walking up the Greenwich Train
platform. I bring her baok, and then go for Doddridge, in the
waiting-room. Doddridge has vanished. I rush out, and to secure
my Aunt, ask her to "wait there" (a seat under the clock) while
I fetch Doddridge.
I find Doddridge in the refreshment-room, feeding the dog.
"We've only got five minutes—she can't find her purse. I pay—
sandwich for dog. Now then, back to my Aunt.
No Aunt—try for luggage. See Porter with turtle-dove, showing
it to some other men. Don't see Porter with Arctic rugs.
On my return, followed by Porter and dove, who shan't quit me
any more, I miss Doddridge—[I can't help confounding Dod-
dridge with a "d" briefly and alliteratively}—and suddenly
encounter my Aunt coming out of waiting-room.
"Oh," I exclaim, "here you are, at last."
[Mem. On consideration (reviewing the day from a diary point of
view) this was not exactly the tone in which to address her. Must
be gentle with my Aunt.]
Afraid I spoke roughly—shall I apologise? I see the tears gather-
ing in her eye. Can't be brutal—can't say "only two minutes; n<>
time to cry; come oar; cry when we 're in the train." What can I
do?
Porter does it. Porter says, " Only twe minutes more, Sir."
Then we hurry on. That is, the Porter hurries first to say we 're
coining; I hurry next, at only half the face I eould and should
go if I were alone, and then eomes my Auat, whom at this moment,
in my impetuosity (I am impetuous and hate missing a train) 1
should like either to carry dowm the platform, on a truck, at • run,
or (with another fellow) to take both hands and pull her along,
somewhat after the country dftnee style of " up the middle and down
again." I don't think this cruelly, but as much as to say (if 1
could say it to her), "You'11 thank me for it when you're seated."
She is seated; half a minute more. She's in the earriage—so's
the turtle-dove. Where's the other porter? and Doddridge?
Good heavens! DoDDRTDnE!! and Charlie !—a quarter of a minute.
Stout old Guard, with ruddy f*ee, says, "Wow thea, Sir," intimat-
ing that I must get in and let him shut the door. I say, "Tell me
have you seen—
Quotation suggests itself—" Tell me Shepherd (Guard of the
Ramsgate train) have you seen my Doddrlbgb pass this way?"
No. "With a dog?" shrieks my Aunt.
"Got a ticket for it, M'm?" asks Guard. My Aunt turns to me.
"Yes," I reply; luckily I have, at least, I know I i
but can't find it, or any of them, now, of course; bother
"Yes, and for the maid—"
Sharp Porter (tttddenly). " Moid and little dog, I put 'em second."
He rushes (for sixpence) wildly along the platform, tugs at a
door, lugs out Doddridge (who thinks it s something to do with the
police, or train on fire) and the dog, brings 'em along, I beckoning
iving come out of the carriage again), my Aunt waving her hand-
one,
(ha-
ken
erchief from the window, the old Guard looking at his watch, and
then opening the door with "Now then, Miss —Miss to Dodd-
ridge, which means a shilling prospectively from me—I jump in,
Doddridge is bundled in and falls somewhere as the signal is given,
the engine shrieks, and we are off.
"0, Mum!" exclaims Doddridge, "the rugs and umbrellas!!
They was put in with me, Mum, by the young man as showed me
into the second-class, as, I didn't know as Master George had
took a first ticket for me, Mum, and I've left 'em there, Mum, in
the 'urry. "Whatever shall we do, Mum? There! I wouldn't ha'
had that tappen for fifty pound, Mum, I wouldn't."
I say, we shall get them on the first stoppage, and I wish we may.
Mem. What I am on all hands advised to get for My Health is,
Quiet, Repose, and an absence of Responsibility.
First Stoppage. Old Guard (sounds like a Napoleonic title) looks
in, brings rugs, &c. Joy of the party.
Old Guard informs us through the window, pleasantly, that he's
going through with us. I reply that I am glad to hear it.
Mem. Politeness to a Guard, or from a Guard, costs something.
Invariably.
Old Guard, still looking in, says with a knowing look, "All right,
you'd like .this carriage to yourselves"—I, my Aunt, and Dod-
dridge, aged fifty-three if a day—" so I'll do my best to keep it
for you," with which he nods, winks, smiles and locks the door.
Does he think we 're a bridal party, two spoons and an old maid?
or can he imagine that my Aunt wants to smoke?
Smoke! I should like a cigar now, while travelling. The time
above all others. My Aunt nates it. Not to be thought of—or
rather to bo thought of as much as I like, but not to be tried on any
account.
Mem. Absence of Worry is essential to My Health. I feel I shall
worry myself about not being able to smoke, while I'm at my Aunt's.

A LOGICAL REFUTATION OF MR. DARWIN'S THEORY.
Jack (who has been reading passages from the "Descent of if an" to the Wife whom he adores, but loves to tease). "So YOU see, Maby,
Baby is Descended from a Hairy Quadruped, with Pointed Ears and a Tail. We all are!"
Mary. "Speak for yourself, Jack! I'm not Descended from Anything of the Kind, I beg to say; and Baby takes
AFTER ME. So, THERE I"
IN THE HANDS OF THE SANSCULOTTES.
Fain we would turn our eyes; spare easy blame;
Nor take her plight for text wise saws to spin.
Has she passed through the famine, and the name,
By her endurance half redeemed her name
From its foul taint of wantonness and sin,
To sink to this extremity of shame!
If willing captive of this ruffian-swarm.
How fallen—fair, frail Paris—from the pride
With which the harlot-houri plied her charm
Of beauty, weird and witch-like, and the harm
Of those Circean spells that none defied,
But her sweet smile was potent to disarm.
Or if unwilling victim, blacker still
Her infamy, and deeper yet her fall,
Whose nerveless arm and palsy-stricken will,
For fear of less enduring greater ill,
Leave her of shameful fear the shameless thrall,
And, changeful in all else, a coward still.
Beneath the canopy of lurid smoke, _
Brooding above the blood that stains her stones,
Pale phantoms of old terror, new awoke,
The Furies of red Ninety-three invoke,
All but the fiery hearts and trumpet tones
Of the wild zealots that the invader broke.
Out of the gathering woes—wherewith close bound,
Like the scathed scorpion in its ring of fire,
Mad tail on helpless head writhes rancorous round,
Slaying and slain with suicidal wound,—
Comes " Vive la MSpublique!" from those whose ire
Lays the Republic death-struck on the ground.
Till none can say if other hope remain,
Than to seek shameful safety from the foe!
So dyeing deeper her disgrace's stain,
And turning all men's pity to disdain,
Making us own her due in her worst woe.
And bidding those that smote her smite again.
WELL SAID, SIRE!
"I am impelled above all things to give expression to my humble thanks
for the Historic Successes which have blessed the armies of Germany."
Emperor to the Reichstag, March 21.
A brace of approximate words well expresses
The difference 'twixt Gallic idea and Teutonic:
The German aspires to Historic
The Frenchman's are nothing unless
A Case for the Police.
Last Thursday night, as the family were retiring to rest about
half-past ten o'clock, great consternation was caused in the house-
hold of two highly-respected maiden ladies residing in a genteel
villa on the banks of the Thames, not five minutes walk from a rail-
way station and omnibuses both to the City and West End, within a
convenient distance of two packs of hounds, and in the centre of a
good shooting country, by the alarming discovery of a thief in the—
candle!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVAKI.

PARLIAMENT.
onday, March 20. Ex-
cept for the sake of the
profound wisdom and
the brilliant wit which
Mr. Punch brings to
bear upon the least im-
portant and least amus-
ing subjects, there is no
particular reason why
anybody should read the
Essence this week. For
Parliament has done
little, and done that
little dully, a word de-
rived either from the
Welsh dwl or the Saxon
dol, or both, or neither.
Lord Cairns stated
that there is in prepare
We went into Supply, and voted, inter alia, £75,000 to buy
77 pictures and 18 drawings, chiefly of the Dutch school, for the
National Gallery. These pictures were collected by the late Sir
Robert Peel, and the present Sir Robert had had them valued
at £80,000, but had sold them to the natron for the reduced sum.
Mr. Punch happens to know that they are worth at least £100,000
at the present preternatural price of precious paintings. Mr. Ben-
tinck admitted their value, Dut thought that while we had so many
paupers we ought not to buy pictures. This was a bit of clap-trap
that might be well expected from a Republican shoemaker, but
which did not befit the Ups of an educated M.P.
Mr. Peter Taylor objected to the item of £14 Ws. for the
insignia of Prince Arthur as Knight of St. Patrick. Punch is
unequal to any remark on this.
The excellent Bill giving power to Poor-Law Guardians to detain
Casuals in Unions, thus depriving the latter of some part of their
oharacter as Hotels for Vagabonds, was read a Second Time. The
Habitual Pauper will always be imprisoned for some hours, or until
he has done certain work, and in some cases may be delayed to bis
great inconvenience.
It is supposed to be very
much wanted, though
there are not. wanting
authorities who contend
that the remarkable
elasticity of the present
no-system fits it to the
wants of the nation and
to the genius thereof.
We have not the slight-
J ^^^^/^ * v**s» \ upon Half-Crowns. No
new ones have been
coined for a long time,
and no new ones will be coined. They are not called in, but will
be extinguished by Natural Selection in favour of the Florin.
Schoolboys accept nothing under an Angel, 'and_ therefore the ques-
tion does not concern them; but it may be well that anybody who
is now in the habit of being thankful, or pretending to be thankful,
for the Tip of half-a-crown, should understand that he is to profess
similar sentiments when he is endowed with a two-shilling piece.
Hansoms, to which reference was also made to-night, received
compliment, on occasion of explanation why their drivers are to be
paid eightpence for waiting a quarter of an hour, while Growlers
get only sixpence. The time of the Hansom was declared by Mr.
Bruce to be of more value than that of the Growler, because the
former, being expeoted to go faster, was drawn by a better horse.
As* the ladies have taken so largely to the use of Hansoms (especially
of late, on pretence of fear that the close cabs are used for hospital
purposes), it would be well if affectionate request were officially
made to the drivers not to employ the worst of language when any
difficulty of the road occurs.
To-day a question was asked as to the state of Paris, but this was
forty-eight hours before the atrocities which have excited the indig-
nation of Europe, and all that the Minister had to say was that Lord
Lyons, in accordance with the wish of M. Thiers, had removed
to Versailles, as had the other diplomatists.
Next, did Mr. Trevelyan make a speech in support of his proposal
that there should be no more appointments to Honorary Colonelcies.
He wished to begin checking the creation of Vested Interests. But
Mr. Cardwell did not see that this course would be a just one
to those who have already forfeited money in the hope of obtaining
the rewards assigned to General Officers. Sir John Pakinqton,
also, thought that the course would be premature, and Colonel S.
Knox accused Mr. Trevelyan of stumping the provinces and dic-
tating to the Government. On division he was defeated bv 204
to 111.
Next we had a talk on the Principle of Selection. The discussion
was not based on Mr. Darwin's book, which alleges that we are
descended from something like the Larva; of Marine Ascidians (wc
Aint, with an emphatic Capital), but upon the choosing officers for
regimental promotion. Then a squabble about going into Supply,
and a renewal by Mr. George Bentinck of his declaration that the
real Government is below the gangway (" Gang awa," said a Scotch
member, waking up from a dream that he was in Elysium, drinking
toddy with Mary Queen of Scots and Burns), and there seemed to
be something in this, for Mr. Gladstone actually postponed the
Estimates, that Mr. Mundella might be able to make a sj>eech
against them on the following Thursday.
Tuesday. Lord Houghton elicited (a certain class of literary
,,' ," I gentlemen would say eliminated) from Lord Granville a declara-
ble^ in wttv sessions" I tion that EnSland had not intended to recognise the Southern States
I of America, and therefore had not been prevented from doing so by
the influence of Russia.
Two notices were given, which notice. Captain Stacpool is
resolved that the Queen shall have a Palace in Ireland, and Mr.
Mtat.t, has finally made up his mind to destroy the Church of Eng-
land on the 18th of April next.
A debate on Harbours of Refuge, on the proposal of Lord C. John
Hamilton (would he oblige us by signing this way .to avoid confu-
sion ?) that a harbour should be made at Filey. Which is a very
pleasant place, and it is a relief to get over there from Scarborough
(which would be the pleasantest place in the world but for the
visitors), but why it should have a harbour all to itself is not so
clear. The debate was rather worth hearing, some odd doctrines
being advanced. One was, that it is inhuman to have many places
of safety, as the knowledge that they exist induces navigators to
embark in bad ships, and to run needless risks. But the real ques-
tion was one of money, and Mr. Gladstone and Mb. Lowe were
that night stern guardians of the public purse. Lord C. John
Hamilton was defeated by 124 to 89. Nevertheless, we repeat that
anybody wearv of the sham swelldom of Scarborough will find a
delightful Harbour of Refuge at Filey. If he does not like that, he
may go to Philoe; "nobody wants to be a hinderin' of him, do
they?" as Mr. Foker's papa stated and inquired.
Wednesday was devoted to a discussion on a Bill for the abolition
of the Scotch law of Hypothec, word derived from the Latin hypo-
theca, a pledge. The thing is akin to the English law of distress by
a landlord, but unless Mr. Punch is misinformed, the Scotch land-
lord has a very much longer arm than his English brother. Except
that the revolutionary question was asked, whether a landlord ought
to have more power than any other tradesman who lets you have
anything, and that the English territorials affected terror lest the
Government, should abolish their rights, there is only to be said that
the Ministry were in the minority. Observe the value of a little
article. Had the proper one been "a" instead of "the," Mr. Dis-
raeli might now be in the Royal Closet. The defeat was signal,
and the Bill was lost by 184 to 105.
Thursday. Be it known that the House of Lords is enriched by
two additions unto the Roll of Peers. Sir Henry Bulwer, Author
and Diplomatist, and deservedly successful in both capacities, is now
Lord Dallins and Bulwer; and Sir William Mansfield, of
Indian renown, is now Lord Sandhurst. Epigrams on these pro-
motions may be sent in when Dull Folks are tired of sending "For-
Lorne," "Purchase," and "Berlin-on-the-iSprae."
N.B. Not that Mr. Punch objects to Correspondence. He used to
do so, but now that a cart collects paper, to be steiced up, and
reproduced, and the owners of the cart pay for what is
collected, he is delighted to see Toby carrying tons of letters and
sketches down-stairs.
In the Commons, Mr. Mundella let off his oration against the
Estimates, objeoting, on the usual grounds, to the increase of our
defensive power. The Premier answered him, sufficingly, with a
speech, and the House, conclusively, with a majority of 294 to 91.
Mr. Leatham moved to knock off 20,000 men, ana was himself
knocked down by 304 to 74.
Then Sir Charles Dilke did a dreadful thing. He proposed to
cut down the Household Troops. A Talbot oamc to the rescue, and
cut him down by 168 to 51.
Friday. Lord Carnarvon, in an able speech, called attention to
the Tien-tsin Massacre, and to the very unsatisfactory satisfaction
given by the Chinese authorities. He was for dealing with them

much more vigorously than we do. Lord Granville defended his
policy, but somehow omitted his only strong plea, namely, that we
ought to be consistent, and having done nothing to avenge the Greek
atrocities, we ought not to be severe on Chinese assassins.
Mb. Benttnck called Mb. Gladstone's attention to the Republi-
can demonstration of Mb. Odgeb and his friends. The Premies
said that he should not interfere, and that such matters were best
left to sink, unnoticed, into the oblivion which was their destined and
their proper course. Still, pace the Mayor of Dover, we hope that
we may be allowed to laugh at Brutus of Brooke Street.
The rest of the night's proceedings may be called slow, unless any-
body can extract excitement from Mr. Ayrton's announcement
(made with noticeable politeness), that he meant to allow carriages
to go from the Gate by Marlborough House to Storey's Gate. The
Trades Union Bill is to be cut into two Hills, and the civil and cri-
minal portions are to be severed. Is this a circumbendibusa,ue mode
of abandoning the latter? To use an entirely new quotation, Nous
verrons.
FASHIONABLE ECONOMY.
Here is a scrap of highly interesting intelligence from a fashion-
able writer:—
"The reversible satins are gradually gaining ground in England."
If we were the father of a fashionable family, we should be deeply
gratified by this momentous news. We presume, of course, these
satins, when worn out upon one side, can be turned and worn till
they are worn out on the other. Thus, a fashionable father may
chuckle and quote Shakspeare of his fashionable daughter, "Aye,
she can turn and turn, and still go on turning" her reversible satins.
Satin at first thought seems hardly a material to be lauded by
economists.. But it may do a man a good turn when it is made
reversible.
SCOTLAND YARD.
Here's a health to the brave Police
For preserving Her Majesty's Peace;
We've their pay to augment;
It were money well spent;
And their numbers we'd better increase.
In our midst we have felons and foes,
And we need more defenders from those:
Men who '11 bear back the knaves
By the show of their staves.
And, if need be, with prods and with blows.
We have ruffians and rowdies, who fain
Some occasion for plunder would gain;
We have democrats who
Are allied with that crew,
Whom the Government fails to restrain.
They 're in Progress advanced; so far gone
Revolution's brood, mingled with spawn
Of foul Licence and Crime,
It is very high time
That those rascals were told to move on.
For the gallant Police give three cheers.
May they catch all our rogues by the ears!
In one toast we '11 combine
The Police with the Line,
The Militia, and bold Volunteers.
Accounted for at Last.—Is it not strange that the "best Man"
at a Wedding is not the Bridegroom? This must be the reason of so
many unhappy marriages.

"By one o'clock the White Saloon was full. The throne of

and advancing to the throne take it away. Is there to be no
throne, then? 1b the whispered inquiry among the ladies in the

Peace folds these blood-stained hands;

On iron, blood, and stone,
Lo, a white dove hath found its seat
O'er the new Kaiser's throne!

A BEAVE PEIEST.
Very well said, Chaplain-General Gleig. Your letter (in the Times),
touching the Purchas decision, Reverend and Dear Sir, does you honour.
You tell the Chaplains in the Service that they, of aU people, are most bound
to show obedience to constituted authorities, and therefore you commend the
judgment of the Council to their best attention. Sir, with exactly the reverse
of disrespect, Mr. Punch cites your and his friend William of Avon. "Your
Worship speaks like a thankful and reverent youth, and I praise Providence
for you." But there is no novelty in your saving the right thing at the right
time.
0 dear Sir, labuntur AnniJ That is why Mr. Punch used a quotation with
youth" in it. You are a goodly evergreen. But, Sir, what an awful time it
is since what foUoweth was written about your reverence. The bard {Punch's
contributor, Db. Maginn) writ in Fraser's Magazine—there was idiotic talk of
Republicanism then, as at present—
"And if the How were opening now.
Would flame once more the soul of Gleig;
The surpliced crew he would eschew,
And sport claymore and philibeg.*
One rub-a-dub brings ' Parson Sub,'
Where beams the banner of The Beau,
Nor Hume nor Place find softer grace
Than savage Soult, or scamp Junot,
In fields Iberian long ago."
* Must we annotate? Alack for an ignorant rising generation! Well, then, Ma. Gleig,
before taking orders, was a gallant Highland soldier, and fought in the Peninsula. The
bard called him "Parson Sub," from his delightful book, The Subaltern. The Duke
was called " The Beau," from his contempt of foppery. Ma. Hume did not deserve the
insinuation, nor indeed did Mr. Place, who, though a Radical tailor, had good sense.
Soult and Junot were French Generals, of a now non-existent type, for they gained
victories. Iberia is Spain.

As Mr. Punch expected, Dover rose in Revolution. Happily there-

Mr. Punch, and ordaining that his journal should "lay " on the

had the narrowest escape from demolition. He had prepared for a

A1SONG OF SPRING.
(By a Singer who unluckily is Mather out of Sorts.)
Spring's delights are now returning,
Cuttingly the East wind blows:
Blazing fires we must keep burning,
Chilblains else infest our toes.
Fitful are the frequent changes;
One day freezing to the bone:
Next, the glass to ninety ranges,
When the sun has brightly shone.
Hence come asthma and bronchitis,
Coughs and colds and sore-throats too:
Hence the tongue, inspected, white is,
And the cheek is pale of hue.
Rheumatism and lumbago,
Influenza too attacks:
Till we live on slops and sago,
And lie helpless on our backs.
Friends robust enjoy for dinner
Ducklings and spring cabbage sweet;
Envious we grow daily thinner,
Getting nothing nice to eat.
Doctors send us nasty mixtures,
Frequent powders, draughts, and'pills:
Indoors keeping us as fixtures,
Till we call to pay their bills.
A Noisy Offender.
Some people appear to have singular notions of the
powers and duties of the Police. In a notice of the earth-
quake in Wales we read that " a lady, in the absence of
her husband, much alarmed by the noise, went in great
excitement for a police officer." We are not told what
the constable was expected to do. Probably to take the
earthquake up; or, at the very least, to report it to
the inspector on duty for making a disturbance.
BEGINNING BETIMES.
It is pleasant to see that scientific improvements and
sanitary contrivances are early brought under the notice
of the youthful members of the Royal Family. The
"Albert Victor Filter " is ready.
ADULTERATION EXCUSED.
Permit me, Mr. Punch, to say a word in excuse of the adultera-
tion of articles of food by those who deal in them—numerous if not
respectable tradesmen.
1 am, Sir, in the habit of using ginger, medicinally. I use un-
bleached ginger. Bleached ginger is spoilt ginger. But unbleached
ginger is only to be had at certain shops. I tried four of the chief
grocers in a principal London thoroughfare the other day for it, and
couldn't get it. An intelligent chemist, at whose shop I asked for
unbleached ginger, did not keep any. He said the Public would not
buy it; but insisted on having their ginger bleached, because it
looked white and pretty. With such a Public to deal with, shop-
keepers are obviously tempted to adulterate food and drink, at least
in order to colour them. Who can wonder at finding copper in
pickles P And who can wonder at the need of enlarging Earlswood
and other institutions of a similar character? Qualification for
those asylums must be greatly on the increase among a Public that
has got to prefer, for the mere appearance of the thing, bleached to
unbleachea ginger.
The ginger which our forefathers consumed in the good old days
of Queen Elizabeth, was manifestly unbleached. "Yes, by Saint
Anne; and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too," swore the Shak-
spearian Clown. It was a true oath then; but would be a rash one
now. Bleaching greatly impairs the strength of ginger's essence;
so that bleached ginger is not hot but lukewarm in the mouth.
Moreover, by being Meached, ginger is hardened, and rendered
difficult to grate.
Ginger, in relation to Earlswood and the like retreats, is as a
straw which, when thrown up, affords information which I do not
repeat to you any more than I should offer instruction equally
superfluous to my grandmother. On behalf of the small tradesmen,
however, whom public imbecility tempts to do worse things than
VOL. LI.
bleaching ginger, I will not go so far as to say that it is not desirable
that the Pillory should be reinstituted, but would only venture to
suggest that the number of eggs with which the People would be
allowed to pelt the rogues standing therein, should, in cases of
adulteration extenuated by circumstances of temptation, if possible,
be limited. Allow me to call myself Clemens.
P.S. Perhaps, too, justice tempered with mercy would require
that the eggs should not be too stale.
THE HEDGE-SPARROW'S HOORAY!
A Hedge-Sparrow, warbling"on a spray,
Said to a Cock Robin, on All Fools' Day,
You may say what you like about your nest;
But we 11 lay you an egg that shall beat your best.
"Indeed " the Cock Robin replied, "how so?"
Said the Hedge-Sparrow—" What I have sung, I '11 show.
Your eggs are red-freckled, and ours light-blue';
And that is the colour of the Cambridge Crew."
In and Out.
The best motto for the Royal Albert Hall, with its admirable
arrangements for going in, coming out, and returning, or, as the
lawyers phrase it, ingress, egress, and regress," would be a not
unfamiliar line of Shakspeaee, slightly modified :—
"It has its exits and its entrances."
'Impressions op Greece."—Candle-droppings on the carpet.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
onday, March 27. The Mar-
riage with your Sister-in-
Law Bill came on for Second
Reading in the House of
Peers. To parody a mar-
vellous line from Shelley,
"0 Sister!' Legislation' is
a delicate tiling,"
particularly when it affects
a Sister. The BUI was pro-
moted by the Judge in
Divorce, Lord Penzance.
who delivered a long and
able speech in its favour.
It was opposed by the Duke
of Northumberland, and
then, after speeches from
Lords Lifford and Den-
man, the first for, the second
against it, the Lords threw
out the Bill by 97 to 71. So
the less instructed classes,
who are not apt to perceive
that whether a law be good
or bad it must be obeyed
while it ^is law, will com-
prehend merely that the
Archbishop of Canter-
bury for the Church, Lord
Penzance for the Law, and
the House of Commons for
the Nation, approve of the
repeal of the prohibition, but that twenty-six noblemen are able
to maintain it. Which facts seem to have enraged Serjeant John
Simon, M.P. for Dewsbury, for he has given notice of a Resolution
that the right of the Lords to reject Bills which have several times
passed the Commons, is unconstitutional, and ought to be limited.
This proceeding is one which we should not have expected from an
LL.B. and a Serjeant-at-Law. though it would not have surprised
us if adopted by another gentleman of the name of Simon, whose
negotiations for the purchase of certain confectionery were frus-
trated by the circumstance of his not possessing a small portion of
the circulating medium of exchange.
Me. Lowe declines to let us have Adhesive Stamps on commercial
bills. His reasons are, that officials might be too stupid to put on
the right stamps, and too fraudulent to cancel them on use. The
view may be sensible, but it is not complimentary. Perhaps, if
officials were better paid they would be more clever and more
honest.
The War Secretary deolared his final mind on the Martini-Henry
rifle. All sorts of tests prove that this is the best possible weapon
for our soldiers; and, therefore, there is to be no more inquiry or
delay, but the Martini-Henry is to be placed in the hands of all our
Braves who shoot.
The Spanish Council of State has at length authorised the pay-
ment of the Compensation Money to the crew of the Tornado.
Those unfortunate persons owe this entirely to the incessant exer-
tions of Mr. Punch, but he expects no commission on the amount,
but begs that they will drink his health with cheers like a tornado.
The word being from the Spanish tornado, it is all the more fit that
Spain should on this occasion raise the wind.
Previously to First Lord Goschen's ttebut in his new character,
Mr. Graves moved that we ought to have Gun Vessels, of light
draught, to protect our harbours. There was debate, but such
satisfactory assurances being given, there was no division.
The new First Lord then moved the Navy Estimates, and did so
in a very able manner. You may be content with knowing that he
asks for something under Ten Millions of Pounds—takes £385,000
more than last year—wants only the same number of men and boys
as before—and spends the excess on Ironclads, and other valiant
vessels. The men and boys, and some two millions and a half were
voted. "Rule Britannia, Britannia rules," &c.
Tuesday. The Lords discussed what was described as the Law of
the Reserve Forces, but which turned out to be the question as to
the powers of Lord Lieutenants of Counties, as to the appointment
of offioers in the Militia. A minor point, though perhaps it was not
minor in the opinion of Lord Vivian, who moved for a Committee,
was that he had been "snubbed," he said, by Mr. Cardwell.
Lord Salisbury said that the Government were so manifestly
wrong in the matter complained about, that it was not worth while
inquiring. The motion was negatived. On the main question there
is no doubt that though the Lord Lieutenants are usually high-
minded personages, the nation would be best served by their having
no power to appoint officers.
More important was a speech by Lord Strathnairn, sometime
Commander of the British Foroes in India. He, speaking as one
who has authority, and not as the scribes who scribe upon questions
whether they understand them, or do not, declared that a shameful
ignorance of strategy characterises the British officer. That Brave,
who is full of noble qualities, ought to be instructed, or he would
certainly lose battles which his valour and that of his men would, if
properly directed, win. Government and the Duke of Cambridoe
admitted the truth of the critioism, and made consoling promises.
In debate on the Armament of Gibraltar, Sir Henry Storks
assured the Commons that everything was being done to strengthen
so important a place. Satisfactory in itself, Sir Henry, and even
more satisfactory as showing that philanthropocosmopolitanism
isn't going to make us give up Gib. Observe, as a literary exercise,
the exquisite art of that last passage, and compare it with Shaks-
peabe's multitudinous seas incarnadine, making the green one red.
Also remember Thomas Hood's illustration of these last words, a
yokel being turned into a soldier. "Happy ye," who sit at the
feet of Gamaliel Punch, and drink wit and wisdom from his
inexhaustible Rabelaisian Oracle of the Bottle.
In discussion on Export of Arms to Belligerent States, Mr.
Lowther proposed that this question should be settled with foreign
nations. Mr. Henry James contended, with ability, that any such
attempt would complicate the subject, and break down the simple
laws of political economy; and when Punch adds that Sir Roundell
Palmer praised that contention, and to a great extent agreed with
Mr. James, it will be understood that about enough had been said.
But nevertheless there was a good deal more said, and then the
motion was withdrawn.
The Trades Unions Bill was cut in two, and made a sort of
Amphisbama, and in the course of the week, both halves went
through Committee.
Wednesday. To-day Mr. Punch was not in his place in the
House, but in his place in the West Arena, block B, of the Royal
Albert Hall. He had the happiness of hearing his Roval Lady and
Mistress, Queen Victoria, say this to the Prince of Wales :—
"I have to express mi/ great admiration of this beautiful Hall,
and my earnest wishes for its complete success."
Mr. Punch's cheer tore all other shouts to shreds, and then he
rushed up-stairs to a refreshment room, and poured a HbatioD in
honour of his Queen, and to the crowning of her wishes." The
heathens shed their libations on the ground, or on a victim. But
Mr. Punch didn't see any victim handy, and he did not wish to
splash the new flooring. Besides, as has been solemnly affirmed by
the Christian Young Men of Dover, he is anything but a heathen.
He was then graciously pleased to proceed to the East Balcony,
block N, and to gaze down on the brilliant scene. Having expressed
his unhesitating opinion that it was splendid, he retired to a cigar
in Palace Road, but the wind being cold, he came back again, in
time to direct a respectful but admiring gaze at his adored Princess
of Wales (in beautiful ruby), his worshipped Princess Louise (in
bridal white), and to shout a good deal more when his Queen rose,
and finally saluted the Eight Thousand.
As for the Commons of England, such of them at least who were
not at the Albert Hall with the Premier, they discussed a Bill
invented by Lord Sandon, for establishing Parochial Councils in
the interest of the Church of England. The Bill was read a Second
Time j but, as it was arranged that nothing more was to be done
with it at present, all that need be said is, that the plan proposes to
make the laity work with the clergy. Lord Sandon's appeal to
the Dissenting Members to assist him in a scheme for the good of
religion, was not ungraciously received.!
Thursday. Lord Lauderdale's demand for a return of the
number of ships of the sort required for the defence of our Har-
bours and Coasts, was met by an explanation that there were none,
as yet, that met his description.
A petition, asserted to have been signed by 250,283 women (or at
all events to have that number of names attached to it) against one
of the Sanatory Acts, was heaved into the House by two Members.
Scntentife ponderantur, non numerantur.
Then came the long-expected debate on the conduct of Ministers
in accepting the Black Sea Conference. The affair was a fiasco.
Mr. Bernal Osborne did not describe it amiss when he compared
it to flogging a dead horse. None of the great guns went off. Sir
Charles Dilke put the whole case against the Cabinet as strongly
as he could, and at the end of the debate the Foreign Under-Secre-
tary, Lord Enfield, replied, with aplomb and effect. The Premier
would not allow the motion of censure to be withdrawn, and it was
negatived. Moral.—Russia has all she wanted, but she has had to
be civil, and perhaps no particular harm will oome of the changed
securities, while, certainly, England does not go to War.
Friday. Lord Dallino and Bulwer took his seat. Mr. Punch
congratulates his Lordship on his well-earned honours, and, by way

of promoting; conversation, would like to ask him what he thinks,
just now, of France, Social and Literary, and of the Monarchy of
the Middle Classes in Paris.
The Commons mustered thinly to hear Mr. Bailie Cochrane
urge upon the Government that something should be done to procure
for France a mitigation of the German terms of peace. Mr. Glad-
stone, in defending the course of the Cabinet, made the best speech
which he has delivered this Session. He objected to being hampered
by any Parliamentary resolution, but promised to avail himself of
any opportunity of lightening matters for the French.
Finally, there was an amusing debate on the Privilege of Married
Women to commit Crime at the suggestion of their Husbands. It
arose out of the case of Martha Torpey of the Diamonds and
Anaesthetic. Mb. Douglas Straight made his dibut, and explained,
having been an eye-witness of her trial, that her being' a little
woman with a baby," really got her oft—the jury waxing senti-
mental. Ridicule of jurymen angered Mr. Montague Chambers.
There was able law-talk, especially by Mr. Jessel and the
Attorney-Genkrax on the status of she-criminals, and it is pro-
bable that we shall soon cease to insult a strong-minded and strong-
bodied woman, by acquitting her on the presumptuous presumption
that she Did as She Was Bid.
Saturday. The University Boat Race, and the Isis was again
defeated by the Cam. At least we suppose so. But, as there seemed
to be some difficulty about the Press, we accredited and dispatched
to the scene a Special Reporter of our own, whose portrait we
subjoin.

This individual has not since been heard of, and therefore we are
obliged to borrow from our contemporaries the information that
Light-Blue won by some two lengths. We need hardly say that Mr.
Punch wasn't going to get up in the middle of the night to see a
race on the river. Father Thames appears to have forgotten his
duty to the civilised public. Is this his gratitude for the Embank-
ment, or his revenge for Barking?

pointed, and on whose character the breath of calumny has never
yet alighted, was the other day found devouring a favourite author,.'
The Height of Sabbatarianism.—Finding a bank-note on the
pavement on a Sunday, and declining to pick it up.
SCIENCE IN FASHION.
A full, true, and particular account, of the Princess Louise's
wedding-dress appeared, of course, in the Morning Post. It indi-
cated, very signally, what has been for some time observable by any
student of our esteemed friend, Le Follet, that millinery is fast
rising into the dignity of a science. This inventory of "The Bridal
Attire" is, in the complexity of its details, equal to an elaborate
architectural or anatomical analysis. It really may be said to be
quite a model of scientific precision; specific even to the niceties of
botanical nomenclature. Limits of space forbid the description of
the entire costume to be quoted at length, but so much of it as the
concluding portion, comprehending one item, will exemplify the
rest:—
"The bridal veil is made en suite with the tunic and flounce, but, instead
of the cornucopia a bouquet is substituted, and is worked from a sketch mode
by Her Royal Highness. 'Ibis bouquet is composed of roses in the centre,
surrounded by lighter flowers, among which orange-flowers, myrtle, jasmin,
and niyosotis form part. The delicate quaking grass {Briza med%a) and grace-
ful fronde of fem (Polystiehum angulare) appear to great advantage on the
net, which is sprigged with small sprays of orange-blossom and marguerites,
and powdered with very small rings."
The exactness with which the quaking-grass {Briza media) and the
fern {Polystichum annulare) are particularised is remarkable. One
wonders, however, that an adept in dress-making so evidently
scientific as the author, whose descriptive powers are instanced
above, omitted to be equally precise in a preceding portion of his
statement, where, having explained the tunic," whereon "the
most prominent objects are medallions containing bouquets" of
certain flowers, he goes on to say that:—
"The medallions are surrounded by a wreath of roses and lilies, and above
is a smaller bouquet of tulips, roses, phlox, coreopsis, wistaria, &o., whilst in
the openings of the ground-work butterflies are introduced with very pleasing
effect."
An accomplished naturalist, no doubt, and writing for the infor-
mation of readers to whom the fashions are a matter of serious study
in connection with universal knowledge, he might as well have
added, to distinctness in point of botany, equal descrimination
respecting entomology. He speaks of butterflies as introduced with
very pleasing effect, among the flowers in the medallions of the
Princess's tunic. How pleasing the effect was we should be able to
imagine all the better if we knew exactly what butterflies those
same were. Another time, perhaps, on a like opportunity, he will
mention tho ornamental insects' names, and may tell us that in the
openings of the ground-work, or some other equally suitable region,
were introduced butterflies, namely, for instance, the Swallow-
tailed Butterfly (Papilio Machaon), the Common Blue Butterfly
(Polyommatus Alexis), the Red Admiral (Vanessa Atalanta), the
Peacock (Vanessa Io), the Black-veined White or Hawthorn
Butterfly (Pieris Cratcegi), and the familiar Cabbage Butterfly
(Pontia Brassiere). Moreover, since beetles as well as butterflies
are sometimes included among the decorative elements of feminine
costume, he must not forget to cite the entomological names of the
Coleoptera as well as those of the Lepidoptera in occasionally describ-
ing a dress embellished with insects of both those orders.
THE ORDER OF THE BATH IN PARIS.
At last there really seems to be a glimmering of reason among the
Reds of Paris. See what the Daily News is able to report of them:—
"In the name of public health the Commune requisitions warm baths for
the National Guards."
There is very little doubt that the (black) guards who have been
putting Paris in hot water would most of them be all the better for
a bath in it. Perhaps the next thing they will do will be to requisi-
tion some soft soap, with the intent to give themselves a sanitary
lathering. Considering the dirty work which they have recently
been doing, few of them can boast of having clean hands just at
present; and every sincere friend of order would rejoice if, when
the Great Unwashed have come out of the bath, the Government
were able to give them a good towelling.
A Very Large Family Party.
The total number of authors in Allibone's great Dictionary of
Etiglish Literature, we are told, is 46,499, and of these no fewer
than 810 are—perhaps we ought not to break the news so abruptly—

To find the palpable proof—to the tune of " Vive la Mpublique.'"
Nor is Citizen Odger here to pronounce what our English Repub-
lic 's to be,
But merely to draw up a programme, and appoint a Com-mit-tee:
And to lay down the keel of a Central Republican Association,
And to put forth—bless him!—as we did, an address to the British
Nation!
And in place of the Union Jack to nail the red flag to the mast,
With texts for general guidance—as, "The cobbler beyond his
last;"
And " Jack's as good as his master, in faot decidedly better"—
And " Property is robbery," and " Law is a dead letter."
"In the boat of the selfish capitalist let the workmen shove their
oars,
And treat his accumulations as their Co-op'rative Stores;"
And proclaim the pregnant principle—-which he who runs easiest
reads—
"To every one according," not "to his deserts," but "his needs."
And when these sacred doctrines take root here, we shall see,
This side the Channel also, the growth of the Liberty tree;
With its blessed fruit upon it, gleaming ruddily far and wide,
Above, red caps, red flags, and, below,—something red 'tis as well
to hide.
So good speed to your National Movement—no fear it should not
make way,
With the light of France to guide it on, still on, to the perfect
day!

MY HEALTH.

Things' I feel inclined to say, but don't—{keep 'em for another
time). The noise made by the train fits any tune (hum one and try it
—hum another. Can do this when with musical friend, but not
now; keep it.)
That we wriggle about a good deal in this train.
That time soon passes while travelling.
That Railway Travelling is superior to Coaching.
That it 'b delightful to get out of Town.
That the Country is looking very well.
Mem (to consider trhat I mean by this:) Whatever anyone else
may mean, I find, on analysis, that my notion is, that the Country is
different to Town, that it is green, that there are trees, that there
are fields, that there are sheep and cows.
That it is impossible to make out the name of a station from
listening to the Porters.
That we want a new Act requiring uniformity of pronunciation
among Railway Porters.
That it's a great mistake to allow stupendous advertisements in
stations. Strangers might easily mistake "Panklibanon," or
"Ozokerit," when in enormous letters on a large board, for the
name of the place.
Mem. Panklibanon wouldn't be a bad title: sounds eastern.
"Cedars of Panklibanon," &c. Wonder what Panklibanon really is.
One thing I do know, that it is not another name for Canterbury,
where we are now halting, and I make this note.
Mem. It is a pity, also, that Guards, Porters, and Officials gene-
rally differ as to the time the train is going to stop at an intermediate
Station. One says, "Two minutes;" another, Hardly a minute;"
a third, "Four minutes;" a fourth, "Off directly." Our own con-
fidential Guard assures me that I shall have plenty of time for a cup
of tea or coffee and a bun, and he will show me the refreshment-
room. This results in his getting a glass of beer (from me), and in
my ordering a cup of tea, and just getting it very hot, when I'm
trying to swallow a sponge-cake. The bell rings, somebody outside
cries sternly, "Any more going on?" and our old Guard looks in
to say, "Now then, Sir, time's up."
Continuing, on my resuming my seat (being received coldly by my
Aunt), to "think," and to make occasional notes (which I manage
by grasping my pocket-book tightly in my left hand on my knee,
ana pressing down upon it heavily and Blowly with my pencil,
producing thereby a kind of musical character which subsequently
costs me some considerable time and trouble to decipher) would
gradually send me to sleep, but for Doddridge, who can't be
persuaded that the wheel is not on fire, and my Aunt, who is sure
we are going so unsteadily as to be certain of an accident.
Mem. Sympathetic nerves. They make me quite uncomfortable.
Doddridge sniffs, and is sure it's fire. My Aunt clutches the seat-
arms convulsively every three minutes, and says, jerkily, "I
can't stand this—I know I can't"—then she breathes, as if with
difficulty, relaxing slightly her hold on the arm—three minutes of
quiet travelling—when we come on to a decline, or an incline, or a
beautiful bit of engineering, which takes us on to a curve, and
nearly sends my Aunt into a fit.
I tell her, cheeringly, that there's nothing to be frightened at. I
beg her to think how many thousands travel and yet—
I've done it. Doddridge has begun to sob, and my Aunt is
staring, in a three-quarter-face attitude, out of the window, with
the tears gradually gathering in both eyes.
WTiat have I said?
• •••«•
JRamsgate.—My Aunt likes to take watering-places at a disad-
I vantage, as it were. She is the guest who comes too early, and
I witnesses the preparations.
I February is not the season for Ramsgate. Ramsgate is " to let."
: There is no one on the pier. There is no one on the sands. There
is no one in the street. There is no one on the promenade.
My Aunt has very nice lodgings. There's a piano in the dining-
'drawing-room, which I am glad to see.
After all, we shall manage to be cheerful.
Mem. With regard to My Health, go in for diet. Also for quiet.
Diet and Quiet. Just the opportunity here. Opportunity also for
reading, not writing (except occasional notes), but only reading.
A little music in the evening will bo cheerful. I ask my Aunt,
'after dinner, to sing. She will. Her collection of songs is of a
I deeply melancholy character. She commences with " The Forsaken,'"
'which makes Doddridge, who is in a corner knitting or doing some-
thing with a piece of green leather, a pattern, and a needle,
snivel. On her finishing, I say, " Very pretty. What is it?
! and I examine the copy. Will she sing again? Yes. She selects
\" My Heart is Sore —which is very depressing. The burden
of this is, that the singer (my Aunt) complains of having been
'slighted and neglected for another (some other lady), after
having trusted herself to the gentleman apostrophised in the ballad
as "Ah, cruel! couldst thou" something or other, which he not
only apparently could, but would, and, for the matter of that, had
done, and pretty effectually too.
After this, we three sit thoughtfully (I don't know what I'm
thinking about), and the Dove coos plaintively. I sleep next door
to the Dove, and hate him.
My Aunt now rises and examines her rSpertoire. She chooses
another. It is "alighted," which cheerful composition shuts up
Doddridge entirely, and sets my Aunt gulping with emotion. She
breaks down. They are both crying. What am I to do? I don't
feel inclined to cry. I wish I did. I would willingly. My Aunt
oan't find her pocket-handkerchief, so, it being a lovely evening and
warm for this time of year, she goes out of the open window, and
sobs on the steps leading into the garden. Doddridge retires. I
look at my watch. Nothing to do. No books. Forgot to buy
papers. 9-30. Too early for bed. I wonder if this sort of thing
will go on every night.
My Aunt says (returning from window), "I'm afraid you'll find
it rather dull here."
I reply, "Oh no, not at all. It's just what I want. It '11 do me
good.
My Aunt hopes it will, and, taking her candlestick, goes to bed.
Quarter to ten. Well, yes, I will go to bed. It's so calm and
quiet here, I shall get a good night's rest. I might smoke outside.
No, it's getting cold, and above all things my Health requires me to
j be very particular about the night air. Daren't smoke in the house.
Perhaps it will do me good to give it up gradually. Am restless.
Bother my Aunt's songs, they've made me quite sad.
In the front of the house it is a calm night: at the back, where
my bedroom is, it is a rough night. Peculiarity, perhaps of Rams-
gate. I've heard that the climate is different on both cliffs, but
that there should be scarcely a breath of wind in front of the house
and a hurricane at the back-door is a meteorological phenomenon.
I am awake at midnight: 1 am more awake at one a.m: I am hot
and feverish at two. Window rattling, wind howling. I try several

—no, on second thoughts, I won't say anything about the Dove.
Delicate ground—it's a pet. Love me, love my Dove. It is trying
work for the nerves, living with my Aunt. She starts at the least
thing.
If I come into the room at all quietly, she jumps 'up, exclaiming,
"Ah! I do wish you would knock, or cough before you come in."
I'm now always knocking and coughing. I knock first, look in,
and then cough. This will oecome a habit, if I go on with it very
long. Then, if I get tired of a book, and drop off to sleep, and the
book falls, up jumps my Aunt and presses her hand to her heart, as
if I'd shot her.
She will have the coalscuttle outside the room, so that my carrying
a scuttlefull to put on the fire is a feat not unlike Blondins walking
on the tight-rope. It's most difficult to carry it without spilling a
coal, specially while my Aunt is saying, "Do take care, and I
know that the fall of one lump will make her give such a jump as
will be fatal to my steadiness.
If I come upon her suddenly at a turn of the stairs, she clutches
the bannisters, she is so startled. I can't, as it were, accustom hex
to my appearance. I am the Skeleton popping out of the cupboard,
the Ghost on the staircase, the Cuckoo in the clock, the Jack in
the box, anything, in fact, sudden in its movement, and startling—
that is, as regards my Aunt. I propose, in a satirical mood (of which
I afterwards repent, but I teas worried) that I should be perpetually
Slaving a trumpet, or have a bell round my neck like Charlie, the
ttle dog.
For me to come in by the window from the garden simply kills
her. I never saw anybody so frightened in my life. I explain that
I really did not know she was there. Doddridge, calming ner, says,
"0, Master George, you ought to be more considerate.
An Artist Out of Place.
The Morning Post announces that:—
"It has been intimated to a well-known artist that it is contrary to rule*
that he should use the lobby of the House of Commons for the purpose of
sketching Members."
Nobody, one would think, could need to be informed that the
lobby of the House of Commons is not a drawing-room, although a
well-known artist appears to have been using it as a studio.
flippancy.
Any lady who speaks slightingly of Ministers of religion is not a
lady. We were much displeased with Miss Shallow (the Justice's
daughter), the other evening. Referring to the Purchas decision,
which pronounces the white dress to be the only legitimate garb of
the Clergy, the misguided young person said that she should hence-
forth always call the Parsons the Surplice Population.

sounds unreasonable, for it must be obvious even to the meanest

offering their legal servioes to the Board could not fail to be, would
all be of one complexion—fair.

opinions or 'colour' of any candidates," and this time rejoiced to

If with beauty John Bull to imbue,

It was no fool who told us Waterloo was won at Eton:
They are the sole invincibles who won't know when they 're beaten.
Eight even backs that rise and fall with a steam-engine swing,
Eight flashing blades that sweep and turn, swift as an eagle's wing,
Twice eight arms tough as oaken boughs, eight broad and brawny chests,
Eight bulks of seasoned muscle, filling out eight Guernsey vests—
'Twas with these, along the towing path, exultant Cambridge saw
His good ship clear of Oxford, foot by foot, brave Goldie draw.
And still light grew between the boats—length, length and a half, and more—
Till when Cambridge passed the Crab Tree two lengths ahead they bore.

"As this is Passion week there will be no racing."
The owners of studs and members of the Jockey Club,

therefore understand how it is that no racing takes

Splitting the Difference.
Speaking of the attendance of the company of Divines
and Scholars, now engaged on a very important work of
Revision, at the meetings they have lately been holding,
the newspapers inform us that "the number of those
present varied between 20 and 21." There is but one
inference to be drawn from tliis statement, namely, that
the exact number of those present must have bean H04.

The Member for Sunderland, Mb. Cakdlish, deolares
that the Naval Estimates are excessive. Hech, Sirs, as
the Honourable Gentleman's friends over tho Border
would say, this Cajjdlish bodie is just a Saveall.
And "Cambridge!" "Cambridge!" was the cry, as
their oars with even flash
Under Gordon's ready yoke-line gave the Oxford boat
their wash:
But Oxford sheers off to the right, out of the Cambridge
spray,
And Hall has lost his water, and holds the outside way.
Upon the shore of Middlesex the stream runs slack and
slow,
And Oxford's oars dip raggedly, and Oxford's heart is low.
Goldie's two lengths at Hammersmith at Chiswick havo
grown three,
And the race looks like a run-away, with Oxford all at
sea!
But when did Leslie yet say die? He has called upon
his men,
They have pulled themselves together, and are creeping
up again:
"fis forty strokes a minute—forty-two! forty-three!
At Barnes Bridge two lengths to the bad, scarce one
at the Brcwerie.
By Jove! the race is still to win, if Oxford can but stay.
And by the Ship a half-length of the lead is pulled
I away ;—
But let Oxford try her fastest, still Cambridge is as fast:
With Leslie's bow at Goldie's stern the winning flag
they've past!
Never a pluckier race was run since first old Father
Thames
Saw the Dark Blue and the Light Blue dare trial of their
I fames;
Xe'cr winner won by harder fight the honours of the day,
-Ne'er loser, of all honours but these, bore more away.
They may sneer their sneer at athletes—at athletes and
athletics;
May preach how youngsters should be all saps, sages, and

But muscle goes to manhood still, and muscular Christi-
anity,
Saving Wilkie Collins' presence, is not altogether
vanity.
There are worse schools than an eight-oar, with its dis-
cipline and training,
And its practical instruction in obeying and abstaining.
There are worse lessons than this race suggests to the

To make our victors modest, and our vanquished self-

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
HK Lords, on Mon-
day, April 3, had
begun their Easter
holidays, but the
Commons were
still at their post.
Nay, one of them
was watching over
the interests of the
pleasure - seeking
Aristocrats. Mr.
Punch mentioned
that Serjeant
Simon had ful-
minated notice
that the Lords
were not to be
allowed to reject
Bills which the
Commons had
often passed.
Counterblast to
Simonism was
emitted by Mr.

less, and not mincingly, as if the first syllable were the Affectionate for
Sarah), who announced his intention to move that the attacks made in the
Commons on the Lords, for exercising an undoubted right, are Unconsti-
tutional. That is a frightful word, and we would give something to know
what it means.
The Elections (Parliamentary and Municipal) Bill, better known as the
Ballot Bill, was read a Second Time, its enemies again exacting assurances from
tho Premier that they were not to be bound by this formality. Mr. Bentinck,
of Norfolk, thought that a dissolution must immediately follow tho passing
such a measure, but Mr. Gladstone cheered him up, and entreated nim to
tranquillise his mind, as' nothing so " wicked" as adissolutiou was being thought
of. Sir J. Elfhinstone denounced the Bill, declared that he would avail him-
self of every form of the House to defeat it, and instantly allowed the second
reading to be taken without a division.
Then did Home Secretary Mr. Bruce introduce his great measure against
Intoxication. This objectionable practice he hopes to hinder, in some measure,
by the following enactments :—
CONCERNING LICENCES.
The country being divided into districts, the Magistrates of each district arc
to say how many Public-houses it wants.
They are to advertise how many* Licences they will issue, and these are to
be sold by auction to the highest bidder, only he must be Virtuous.
If they announce too many the Ratepayers may interfere.
The Licence or Certificate will enable the buyer, in consideration of the price
he is to pay, to keep a Public for Ten Years, but he may bo turned out if he
keeps it in an improper manner.
The .Resident Manager of the Public will be the responsible person.
Present Publicans have a sort of vested interest for Ten Years, subject to
conditions of good behaviour.
If penalties have reached £03 in three years, the licence is forfeited without
appeal.
Here be it said that the Government hope much to diminish the number of
Public-houses.
CONCERNING nOURS.
Publics and Beershops to keep the same hours.
They arc not to open before VII. in the morning, as Mr. Biicck wishes to
repress the practice of early drinking by the artisans.
In London everything is to shut at XII at night.
In County Towns at XT.
In Rural Districts at X.
On Sundays everything is to be shut except between I and III in the after-
noon, and between VII and IX in the evening.
ONCERNINO TirSINESS.
A Manager permitting it on the premises is to be punished, or he must prove
that a drunken person whom he has made drunk was not drunk when the
Honor was supplied.
f ipsiness in a Public or in the Streets, is to be atoned for by a fine of One
Sovereign, or Hard Labour.
Heavier punishment still for a tipsy person who ought to have been
specially sober, as one in charge of horses, steam-engines, or dangerous
weapons.
CONCERNING ADULTERATION.
Samples may be collared by Government inspectors, and for the first offence
a heavy fine, second, imprisonment, third, A HEAVIER
FINE AND FORFEITURE OF LICENCE. [Ha, ha!
Mr. Bung.
CONCERNING TRAVELLERS.
A Traveller, qualified to be supplied with refresh-
ment, must be not less than Five Miles from his resi-
dence.
The Publican will have to prove that this condition
was complied with.
A Sham Traveller is to be severely punished.
CONCERNING BAD CHARACTERS.
A stringent clause accomplishes that which Mr. Knox
and other Magistrates have tried to do, but have been
baffled in doing by the success of Quibble on Appeal.
Mr. Bruce holds himself to have steered between the
Seylla of Tee-total Idiotism, and the Charybdis of
Vested Greediness. He hopes to do good, but he says,
with Mr. Punch, that "Education alone is able to
create among the people a higher standard of morality
—a greater contempt lor and disgust of drunkenness, and
to teach them what was due to their families and to
themselves. By these means, and by these means alone,
can we hope to make the people of this country what
the)' ought to be—a moral, religious, and sober people."
The Bill was well received, but it was of course too
complex to be judged offhand. Sir Wilfrid Lawson,
true to his abstinence policy, could not understand
Licensing what was Wrong. Sir. M'Laren approved of
the general scope and spirit of the Bill. Other Members
spoke, but reserved opinion. The measure will be a
pleasing study for Parliamentarians and others during
the holidays.
Mr. Punch has a million of good qualities, and one of
them is the quality of Mercy, which is not strained.
Having expounded one large measure, he does not in-
tend to be diffuse upon another. He contents himself,
and his Public, by saying, that after Mr. Bruce came
Mr. Goschen,
11 Not in hU Gorgon Terrors clad,
Nor circled with his vengeful bund,"
that is, not as the First Lord of the Admiralty, sur-
rounded by the "brawny boarders that mount by the
chains, and are over their buckles in bl"—ess us, if we
haven't forgotten thelngoldsby rhyme! Nevermind. He
came as the gentle exponent of a BiU on Local Rating
and Local Government.
Mr. Gosctten had thoroughly mastered the subject,
and he discoursed on it with lucidity and with logic.
Mr. Punch proposes merely to say that the Bill con-
structs a system of uniform local government in England
and Wales (not London), and of uniform taxation. And
that the Government proposes to surrender the House
Tax (£1,200,000, M'm) in aid of Local Rates.
"The old rating system is laid on the shelf,
Fal a lal la! Ah! Fal a lal la!
If you want anv more you may sing it yourself.
Fal a lal la! All! Fal a lal la!"
to adopt
old Ade'
a song which used to be merrily sung at the
lphi Theatre by the merry and sweet-voiced Mrs.
Fitzwilliam in days when but no matter. Excuse
these weeps.
Thursday.—Mr. Miall presented his compliments to
the Hierarchy and other clerical members of the so-
called Church of England; having intended to destroy
that Church on the 18th April, he has decided on letting
it endure until the 9th May.
After an uninteresting debate on the Enclosure Law
Bill—stay, we '11 enliven the theme with a Byronic
quotation,
"No Common be enclosed without an Ode,"
the Trades Unions Bills were finally considered.
Please to observe that what is called the criminal portion
of the legislation displeaseth the Unions, so the following
sop is thrown to them. In the titles, nothing is to be
said about "Masters and Workmen," and the stronger
measure is only to be called "An Act to Amend the
Criminal Law, and for the words "Trades Union" is
to be inserted "Permanent or Temporary Association,
or Combination." Perhaps it is not remarkable that after
this piece of high comedy, Members were unable to take
anything else, and took themselves off until Monday, the
17th April.

MY HEALTH.
-*N^>- hen I am obliged to ask Aunt if
she wouldn't like to go out for
a walk. My walk is a good
three - and - a - half miles an
hour for a genuine constitu-
tional. My Aunt's is one mile
in an hour and a half, with
stoppages. Tremendous exer-
cise for control of temper —
that's the only exercise it
gives me.
I take my Aunt out in a fly
—shopping, and to see Rams-
gate. Kamsgate, for fly-
driving, is a startling place
for such a nervous system as
my Aunt's. The place reminds
me of the Centrifugal Railway
where you went down a tre-
mendous incline on the left,
were whirled round a circle
(still in your car hcad-over-
heels) and shot up another
tremendous incline on the
right. This is Kamsgate, only without the circle in the centre, its
absence being compensated for by gutters, inequalities in the roads,
and sharp right-angled corners, which the flys take with a bump
that sets *em all straight again, and puts you right for the next hill.
Going down a Hill.—My Aunt's teeth chatter—she is pale. She
draws in her breath: she grasps the side convulsively with one
hand, and Doddbidoe with the other. She is perpetually worrying
the driver to "go gently," which results at last in a funereal pace.
When we are bumped, which happens every other ten minutes, she
shudders and grasps whatever is nearest to her. I swear I am
becoming fearfully nervous myself. The streets of Ranisgato were
never meant to accommodate more than one carriage, and you have
to go almost out of the town before you can get sufficient room to
turn comfortably. When this critical moment arrives, my Aunt
simply steps out and stands on the pavement, retiring subsequently
witnin a shop-door, while the flyman is executing this strategic
movement. In passing another vehicle we have half an inch between
its wheel and ours. It seems as if my Aunt's last moment had come.
She clutches at her heart and gasps spasmodically. As to my
Nerves and my Health—a few days more of this and I shall be a
shattered invalid.
Second Day of this Sort of Thing.—Can't stand it: the two old
women, the dog growling, and the turtle-dove cooing will drive me
wild.
My Aunt has got an idea that a turtle-dove will talk if properly
trained. She practises this for one hour a-day? and asks me to con-
tinue when she's tired. The lesson consists in sitting before the
cage, and wagging your head from side to side, saying, "Pretty!
how d'ye do?' Tends to lunacy.
Mem. Surely this kind of life leads to drinking, or (as I look over
the cliff and watch the waves) to —— but no, I can swim.
This state is the worst possible thing for My Health—I feel it. I
feel that I am heavy, that I have got a pain in my nose, and that I
show signs of being, like Charlie, over-fed. Over-fed! like Charlie;
yes, and growling.
But I am out by myself, for the first time. Alone and free. In
an East wind, that seems to cut right into you, and make a cold
draught, a sort of Suez Canal, through your ribs. I will not return
to ask my Aunt, but will go for a constitutional. Where? Look at
pocket-book, where I've previously noted what to do at Ramsgate.
Mem. When at Ramsgate go to Broadstairs. Good—will look in
at tobacconist's shop and ask my way. I do so.
Th« dramatis persona of the shop on my entrance are—old man
behind the counter (probably the proprietor), a customer (back view),
a large shaggy dog on the floor (evidently a visitor), a big cat on a
is eyeing the cat wist-
comfortably tucked up
asleep, but, in reality,
very much'awake. Uly appearance distraots the dog's attention,
and" offers him another subject for consideration, namely, my legs.
Cat supremely indifferent. Proprietor attending to his business.
Customer choosing a tobacco-pouch. Dog suspicious. Myself
nervous. I cannot help it: after such a turn as I've had of it with
a Jumping Aunt—[Mem. Startling name for a Sensational Novel,
My Jumping Aunt.]—a ring-dove learning to talk, and a water-
nymph (Doddridge, the Crying Maid) of uncertain age (i.e. after
titty). _ My nerves are quite out of order, and My Health, instead of
being improved, is sensibly worsened.
Mem. New verb, To be worsened, i.e., to be made worse. Why

not? To be loosened, i.e., to l>e made loose. Note lor book, in
futuro.
"Get away, you ruffian!" says the Customer, opportunely inter-
fering with the dog's proceedings, who won't allow me to advance
another step. Dog retires (on receiving an admonitory kick from
Customer) with a side glance at cat, conveying the idea that he'd
very much like to meet her by moonlight alone, and give her a bit
of his mind, or rather a bite of it, at the same time sulkily protest-
ing against such treatment before strangers.
This action (i.e. the kick) brings Customer and self face to face,
which, by the way, is not generally the result of a kic k.
"Why "— he exclaims, staring at me.
"Why"— I exclaim, recognising him in two seconds.
It is Budd. The very fellow of all others for me to meet at this
crisis of My Health. Budd is a superlative. He is the jolliest,
cheeriest, best looking, best hearted fellow possible. He is what is
called a man with his heart in the right place. [Awkward, by the
way, if he hasn't; but there are occasions when hearts are not in
the right place, as, for instance, in a panic, when someone's
"heart's in his mouth" (horrible!), or "sinks into his boots".
But this never happens to Budd. He doesn't know what nervous-
ness means, and as for ill health, he appears simply unable to
understand it.]
He is hearty.—I am delighted. What has brought us both here?
Health. I have come in search of it, he has brought it with him.
"By Jove," he exclaims, after taking a good look at me, "I
hardly knew vou at first, you're got so tremendously stout."
"Do you think so?" I ask, with an assumption of carelessness, as
if it was, after all, only a matter of opinion, and that other people
thought I was curiously thin.
"Think so .'" says he, " why look here!" and he pinches my arm,
and then prods me under (to put it neatly) mv fifth rib. I wince.
Bros, who was in the Army, has, I find, taken to farming nnd
country pursuits generallv, and has an eye for fat, having exhibited
pigs and got a medal. '' He wants some of this off, eh, doesn't he f"
he continues, appealing to the shopkeeper, who smiles, clearly afraid
of offending two customers.
"Come and take a Turkish Bath, that 's your tip," says Budd;
"You '11 lose ten pounds of this," another prod in a new place, and
shopkeeper much amused, counfound his impudence, "in a week,
and at the end of a couple of months you'll be fit for a Derby
winner."
This view of the result of a course of Turkish Baths is encourag-
ing, though my recollection of having taken one a long time ago in
London, is that I was seriously ill for three days after.
"Bosh!" cries Budd, heartily; "You come up with me, and
I '11 put you through your paces."
I promise to join him in a bath to-morrow. Will he, for company's
sake, walk with me to-day? He considers.
"No," he replies; "I can't, because I'm going to commit the
enormity of going out fishing."
Everything with him is an enormity. At one o'clock he is going
to commit the enormity of taking a brandy and soda, and a biscuit.
At this moment he is going to commit the enormity of smoking a
cigar." Falling into his way, I inform him that I propose com-
mitting the enormity of walking to Broadstairs.
"Do you good," says he; "take a breather to-day, and go in for
the enormity of a Turkish to-morrow, no beer or butter, and you '11
enter for the Gaspipe Stakes in a fortnight. Melt some of this off,"
another prod, "and choke off your nerves, or you're booked for
a dead 'un before you know where you are."
With this cheerful view of my case, given in the jolliest manner
possible, he summons Growler, the dog, with a playful poke of his
stick—very much like what he s been giving me—and marches out,
Growler nodding to the cat, and expressing himself to the effect
that it won't be long before he has the pleasure of seeing her again.
I am determined. Now I see my way. "Breathers" and Turk-
ish Baths, versus "being a dead 'un before I know where I am."
Subjeot of consideration to occupy time of walk will be, how can
I manage to get quit of my Aunt, Doddridge, and the Dove, or, to
put it in Budd's style, how can I commit the enormity of choking
off my Aunt & Co. (representing my nervous system), train for a
gaspipe match, and so avoid the melancholy contingency of being
booked for a dead 'un. Think it over.
Welsh Babbit Hunting.
A list of fashionable announcements, the other day, contained a
paragraph stating that a Drag Club is being formed in Monmouth-
shire, with the Duke op Beaufort as President, Mr. Price
Hamilton as Secretary, and an uniform consisting of a dark green
coat with flat gilt buttons and a motto engraved thereon in tho
Welsh language. Peradventure, when this Welsh Drag Club goes
drag-hunting, the drag, instead of being a red-herring, will consist
of toasted cheese.

SUNDAY PARLIAMENT.
There is Parliamentary wrangle as to the means of getting more
days for debaiing. A frightful proposal that the Houses shall meet
in November is not a thing to joke about. But surely there is
another way. Why not let the Houses meet on Sundays (after
divine service) for the discussion of Religious Questions only, such
as the Destitution of Churches, the Revision of Lectionaries, the
Repulsion of Bishops, the Burial of Dissenters, the Ransacking of
Nunneries, and the Explosion of Whallcyisms? Prepared by re-
ligious exercises to approach such subjects in a befitting spirit, and
not disturbed by any thought that dinners are waiting (as no one
eats a hot dinner on the Sabbath) the Houses would be greatlv
assisted to desirable decisions. And we suppose that no one wifl
deny that passing an Act of Parliament is a work of necessity or
mercy.

glorious passage :—
"Questions of detail arc raised in order to avoid the discussion of prin-

RED FINANCE.
A! In Belleville's Journal
Officiel, the other day, there
appeared a letter proposing
to pay oft' the German in-
demnity by a tax of three
or four per cent, imposed
exclusively on the fortunes
of the great landowners
and capitalists of France.
This idea is not altogether
original. The classes sub-
jeot to the Income-tax in
this country had all to
themselves the honour of
paying for the Abyssinian
War; and will doubtless be
further honoured by being
solely charged with the ex-
pense of Army Reorganisa-
tion. The Red scheme of
adjusting a national burden
is only a little more partial
than that which was insti-
tuted by British legislation.
If, in I ranee, the property
of only one class be confis-
cated for the discharge of
the nation's liabilities, the
saying about the comparative ingenuity of ourselves and our
neighbours, generally current, will, as regards one particular, have
to be reversed. The Red financiers will have proved that, in the
matter of fiscal, or rather confiscations! arrangements, Englishmen
invent ideas, and Frenchmen improve upon them.

TO PRESIDENT ODGER.
BY AW UN-BEAD REPUBLICAN.
{Found in St. James's Hall, after the Hindignation Meeting.)
0 Odoek, my Codger, you ain't half a dodger,
The way to succeed in this world is success;
I'm blessed if your chances of being a lodger
In Buckingham Palace ain't all in a mess.
You can't git elected, you talk quite dejected,
Your colleagues sits grinning, your spirits to cow;
And then any meeting at which you 're expected
Melts out in a mull, or busts up in a row.
Come, show you 're worth something—the publio's a doubter;
A King, says the Swells, is a Cove as "Can do ;"
To go by your doings thus far, my old spouter,
I'm blowed if I'd bet you could cobble a shoe.
Flare hup! my bold Brutus, and make a diskivery
Of brains—make a boot with a brave double-solo,
And send it to Brumpting by Parcels Delivery,
With President Odoer's kind love to King Cole.
Stupid at the Poll.
Among the "Amendments" to the Ballot Bill is one by Mr.
Leatham, which, as Mrs. Sketchley Brown says, we " don t hold
with." He proposes that the voter should strike out from his Card
the name of the Candidate he does not vote for, instead of the name
of his favourite. This amendment i»in the interest of the Stupid.
But in the interest of the Nation we suggest that the Government
form be adhered to, because that will probably make Mr. Stupid
vote contrary to his own intention, and therefore in favour of the
best man.
Malapropiana.
Mrs. Malaprop presents her compliments to Mr. Bruce, and begs
to be reformed if he considers that her giving just a thimbleful of
spirits to a cabman, for purveying her six boxes up above three
pairs of stairs, would be permitted by the claws .of the Excuseable
Liquors Bill.
NATURAL SELECTION.
"Development of Species!" said an old bill-discounter, "don't
talk to me about development of species. The only thing worth
studying is development of specie!"
THE CENSUS.
It was felt all over the kingdom; and in houses where the families
were large, lasted a considerable time.
Some Heads of Families took it very seriously, assembling the
entire household, in the dining-room, down to the baby, carefully
reading aloud every word of the printed instructions, and prefacing
the actual ceremony with an address containing a history of the
Census in this country from the time of Edward the Confessor, a
recapitulation of its advantages, socially, personally, and politically,
and an impressive appeal to the servant-maids to adhere scrupu-
lously to the truth in all their statements, which they were requested
to attest with their initials. Particular people like these used new
pens for the occasion, enclosed the schedule in an envelope (not
adhesive), sealed it with their armorial bearings, and, in some in-
stances, it is believed, addressed the communication to Her Majesty's
Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department.
Others treated this decennial obligation with unbecoming levity,
filling up the paper, after dinner, with a careless lightheartedness
hardly suited to the solemnity of the occasion, and concluding the
business with three times three and one Census more.
There were several well authenticated cases of maiden ladies
requesting the attendance of their solicitor, to relieve themselves of
all responsibility.
By many the questions to be answered were considered very
inquisitorial, and sarcastic wonder was expressed that Government
had not demanded to know whether they had beer. r6-vaccinated,
what their income and outstanding liabilities ware, and to what
extent they had become imbued, 6ince the last Cen6uj, with the
views entertained by Bishop Colenso, Mr. Darwin, Mr. Yoysey,
and Mr. Purchas.
Tory different from those who were disposed to give more infor-
mation than was required. Old Mhs. Dewburt v-os quice offended
with her son because ne would not write down th-t she could see to
read without glasses, and got up regularly at six o'clook every
morning, winter and summer, and that the baby was the most beau-
tiful child ever seen. Captain T. Dlbdin Bowling, R.N., recorded
all his wounds and engagements, appending full details of the
weather during the week ending April the first; and Professor Bab-
bleforth would like to have favoured the Registrar General with
his views on Trades' Unions, Strikes, and the Co-operative system.
The most graphic pen that was ever manufactured at Birmingham
for elsewhere would fail to describe the indignation, incredulity,
scorn, contempt, and all the other passions sung of by Collins, &c,
which raged in the breast and glowed in the face of Mrs. Greymare
when she looked over the shoulder of her meek and mild husband,
and caught him in the aot of entering himself as " Head of Family."
These were her exact words, as taken down by a short-hand writer
who happened to be on the spot:—" Well, Mr. Greymare. you may
consider yourself the Head of the Family, if you like, and Govern-
ment too, if it chooses, but / don't."
The Smiths maintain their supremacy, the Browns are steadily
advancing, and the Robinsons show no signs of diminution. There
were 10,615 more Joneses than at the last enumeration. A great
falling off was observed in such common vulgar names as Samuel,
William, and Richard, Mary, Sarah, and Ann; and a proportionate
increase of Huberts, Harolds, and Sydneys, Ediths, Etnels, and
Lilians.
We are rather reluctant to advert to the " Age " column, but truth
is great and will prevail, as Cornelius Nepos remarked in a letter
to his uncle, then the Resident Minister at Carthnge. Notwith-
standing the threats of penalties and justices of the peace, and the
progress of education, and the improvement in the position of
women since 1861, there can be but little doubt that some mis-state-
ments as to the age of the inhabitants of these Islands did creep in.
Several rather flagrant instances have come to Mr. Punch's know-
ledge, but he forbears for the present publishing the names and
addresses of the offenders, believing that, on reflection, they will
acknowledge their fault to the Secretary, Census Office. Craig's
Court, 8.W., and forward him a more truthful retmn. Miss
Laquebton defeated the curiosity of her maid by locking up the
document in her strong box, and delivering it in person to the
enumerator when he called: Mr. St. Leger Brandonthorpe
adopted the same course with his num.
Change of Name.

benches" in the House of Commons are more comfortably "uphol-
stered " than the rest of the seats that Honourable Member will in

children of tender years that it is time for them to go to by-by. The
Army Bill, however, if it become law, will, bv putting an end to
furchase, abolish the buy-buy system, in the Cavalry as well as tho
nfantry.

THE DAY OF DROUGHT.
{A Pedestrian's Petition.)
Thy praise, 0 Secretary Bruce,
Shall worthily be sung,
Vor thine endeavour to reduce,
Beneath due licence. BtJNG.
But whilst provision thou dost make
Against abuse of gin,
Ilis ease do not forbid to take
A Briton in his inn.
1 speak no word for them that swill,
I plead not for the sot—
But I espy, upon thy Bill,
A Sabbatarian blot.
When I on Sunday take my walk,
I want my glass of beer—
Of that enjoyment do not baulk
Thy poor Petitioueer!
Save 'twixt the hours of one and three,
And those of seven and nine,
To close thereon each hostelry,
"What reason can be thine?
I fear me that sectarian band
Thy better sense constrains,
On Sundays who, could they command,
Would stop excursion-trains.
0 Liberty is my first love!
I'd tight in her just cause;
My rule, all politics above,
Is " Make no needless laws."
Confound the tyrant King who would
My rightful acts repress;
If any Legislature should.
Confound that, too, no less.
At Hampstead Heath and Hampton Court,
What wretchedness will reign;
When folk who thither shall resort,
No liquor may obtain!
Our Sunday will e'en gloomier still
He rendered than before,.
And unto those, against whose will
'Twill be enforced, a bore.
Sunday excursions may be checked,
On river and on rail,
And that, your Clergy may expect,
Will much their ends avail.
Your tavern-closing Sunday laws
Will none to chapels send,
But numbers more in guzzle cause,
"Saint Monday's " feast to spend.
UNSEASONABLE INDIGNATION.
Is the face of events going on in Paris, to hold an
Indignation Meeting at St. James's Hall, denouncing
the House of Lords, for their refusal to legalise Marriage
with a Deceased Wife's Sister, was at any rate most in-
opportune. This is not the time for assailing an Institu-
tion of our Country. In withholding compliance with
the demand embodied in Mr. T. Chambers's Bill, the
House of Lords must be admitted, on all sides, to have
piusued its traditional policy. Noblesse oblige, and noble
Lords feci bound to refuse every demand for the redress
of any grievance, real or unreal, that they dare, until
they dare no longer. The persons aggrieved by not being
permitted to marry their deceased wives' sisters, are
a small minority, and therefore the merits of their case
do not signify. We many of us delight to maintain,
and even to impose, upon other people, restrictions
which do not annoy or injure ourselves.

THE BRITISH VON MOLTKE.
AS HE APPEARED SALUTING HIS BRAVE ARMY AT BRIGHTON, EASTER
MONDAY, 1871.
A WELSH HARP WITH ENGLISH STRINGS.
lis. Punch's ubiquitous eye has fallen upon four lines of poetry in the
Oswestn/ Advertiser. They are given as the production of a Welshman who
has condescended to compose in the language of Englishmen. They refer to
a combat in which he had been engaged, his antagonist having been armed with
a poker:—
"The knock with the 'prooker' i '11 never forget,
As long as i '11 come to Llangollen;
Whenever i '11 come, i '11 try to go home,
Bit better, bit better, than last time whatever."
They are not absolutely perfect to English ears, and we have an especial
difficulty in accepting "whatever" as a good rhyme to " Llangollen." But
we receive them gratefully as a proof of a conciliatory spirit on the part of
the writer, who does not utterly despise Saesneg.
FRIGHTFUL ANNOUNCEMENT.
We read, to our horror, in a country paper on Monday:—
"Her Majesty having confirmed the sentence of deprivation against the Kevekemj
Mb. Voysey, he will be executed forthwith."
We shuddered for three days, but on the fourth our feelings were relieved by
perusing in the same paper:—
"A Dropped Line.—After 'Mr. Voysey' in the above paragraph, rend 'he refusing
recantation, the judgment of the Council.'"
We breathed again, and with a sigh of thankfulness consigned to the waste-
basket a beautiful paragraph beginning "Shade of Torqueinada! Do we
live in the year of grace 1871?" &c, &c. Then we took the paragraph out
again, as it will do the first time some cad is lined for misbehaviour in church.
Unthinking Masses.
The More Haste the Worse Speed.
So wonderful is the crossing of tides in the Parlia-
mentary ocean
The flood of business is constantly stopped by some
Honourable Member's motion.
Another Oxford and Cambridge Boat Itace has been rowed; and Hammer-
smith Bridge remains. How thoughtless tho people who overcrowd it year
after year to witness that spectacle must be, never to reflect that if, under the
pressure of their enormous weight, it were to come down with a run, the
consequences entailed by the downfall of a structure which could not be
replaced for some time, would be most vexatious to all dwellers in the neigh-
bourhood!

"NO CAEDS!"
How happy was my former life,
So steady, calm, and sober,
Before September, '70
Gave place unto October.
Then every morning I could lie
Upon my pillow napping,
And never care a single rap
About the postman s rapping.
For, though no correspondence calls
In me for strong regards,
My letters I could tolerate,
But not these Postal Cards.
They come upon that fatal morn
In heaps, in shoals, by yards;
Myletter-box was crammed with them,
Those economic cards.
Talking-machines and Pepper's ghosts,
Chiropodists and bards,
Australian meat, and sermons sweet,
"Were all "upon the cards."
My servants read remarks from duns,
"Expressed in language hard:
Mv wife tabooed an Albion feast
Exposed upon a card.
My cook, who's cousins by the score,
All privates in the Guards,
Knows when my wife and I '11 be out,
She sees it, on the cards.
From all domestic privacy.
I feel that I'm debarred;
The very page-boy knows each move,
He's grown a knowing "card."
I'm not revengeful; but I'd like
To see the fellow tarr'd
And feathered, who suggested first
This horrid Postal Card.
AVhen I got married, spooney as
No end of Abelards,
I said, "Dear wife, we '11 keep through life
Our nuptial vow—' No cards!'
"Within the circle of our home
We '11 centro our regards "—
For then who could prognosticate
These public Postal Cards?
This will I do—I '11 advertise,
And offer large rewards
For some one who '11 expatriate me
To where there are " No cards."
An Eye to Business.
Oce dootor's front door has not been properly painted, and ought,
as his friends and patients tell him, to be done over again; but he

WORKPEOPLE AND WAGES.
I like to see the Working Man
Pursue his upward way,
For still, deny it if you oan,
"To labour is to pray."
I like to see him lay, or shape
The brick, wield saw or plane,
Orply the glazier's blade, and scrape

I view him sweep the brush,
Then deftly "job the paint on, 0!
With sympathy I gush.
When he, with swivel-gimlet, drills
A hole, his levelled eye
I mark, until mine own so nils,
That I could almost cry.
But not a Working Man alone
Is he, who wage receives
For work in flannel jacket done,
Or done in his shirt-sleeves.

THREE CURIOSITIES OF ADVERTISING.
This is from a Liverpool paper:—
T)]OUS, educated Gentleman, aged 28, in adverse circumstances,
-t desires to find a Christian who considers it a duty to befriend such.—
Address, &c.
The gentleman has a perfect right to term himself "pious." He
onght to know whether ne is pious or not. But when he calls him-
self " educated," and then calls out for a Christian who considers it
a duty to befriend adverse circumstances, he suggests to us to ask
what is understood, in Liverpool, by education.
Here is another:—
COACHMAN AND GROOM.—First-class testimonials of ten years'
service from Sir William Macahthum; none but a respectable family
need apply; is open for a fortnight.—Apply, &c.
This haughty Menial (yes, a coachman dwells within your " walls,"
the word is rightly used) hails from a colony. We rather admire
his firmness of manner. He seems a person to be trusted to control
fiery steeds. But we do not understand about the fortnight. Pro-
bably, if within that time he does not obtain a coach-box to his
liking, he means to enter the Legislative Council of New South
Wales.
Lastly, here is a gem, set in silver:—
TO CHRISTIANS.—A Young Man, never had the blessing of the use
of his limbs through being set on wet grass, earnestly solicits 42 pos'age
stamps. In return he will send, free, six best Nickel Silver Tea Spoons and
Tongs to any part of London.—Please address, &o.
After remarking that we were unaware that being "set on wet
grass " gave a person the use of his limbs, we demand why the
advantages offered by this advertisement are restricted to Christians.
Hath not a Jew teacups? Hath not a Jew sugar? Hath not a Jew a
milk-jug? If his tea be not sweet enough, doth he not put in more
saccharine matter? If it be too hot, doth he not stir it until it
coolsP Why, also, may not a Turk buy spoons and tongs P Is he
not addicted to coffee (not that he stirs it, by the way), and is he
not always wanting tongs to lift the charcoal to his pipe P Infidels
and heretics, too, may be very sad persons, but it is a persecuting
spirit that would deny them tea-spoons and tongs, a spirit akin to
Nick rather than to Nickel. However, we hope the advertiser will
sell the Spoons.
REBELLIOUS RITUALISTS.
Some five thousand clergymen of the Church of England, includ-
ing Dr. Pusey, have addressed an appeal to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, entreating him and the other Bishops to set the late
judgment of the Privy Council in the Pt/rchas case at naught. His
Grace has very judiciously replied by pointing out to them, that
they are asking the rulers of the Church to break the law. But
most likely they know that as well as he does, being most of them
Ritualists, whose subordination to ecclesiastical authority has very
nearly resembled that of the Clerkenwell democrats to the civil
government. Imitating the gentlemen of the pavement, the gentle-
men of the surplice, peculiarly addicted as they are to processions,
will perhaps get up one of their own Romanesque sort, and march
with banners above their heads, and acolytes at their heels, to hold
a demonstration before Lambeth Palace.
More from Mrs. Malaprop.
Oub. esteemed friend has been spending a few days in the country,
which she says is looking dutiful. Spring flowers are springing up
in most luxurious confusion. Bandyhons are abundant in the
meadows at the back, and her front garden is full of scarlet
agapemones.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FRONt JOAN'S GHOST.
u.vch, Cher Confrere,—It has
been a sad year for me! With
the Prussians at Vaucouleurt,
the Uhlans making requisitions
in my own Domremy, and the
chassepots of a French garrison
broken and burned by Prince
Frederick Charles's soldiers
at the foot of my statue, in the
Place du Martroy, you may well
imagine I have passed a tnauvais
quart d'hcure in this other
world of mine.
But, for all that, my motto is
now, as it was of old, "Espo-
rance!" France was as low
when I came to raise her up;
and I hope she may still have
in her the stuff out of which 1
was made, though it may have
to be worked up after another
fashion.
But if I have not been allowed
to appear in France in her year
of humiliation, 1870, I have
appeared, you see, in London.
\our Rosbifs, I am told, have
been treating me in 1S71 as you
did in 1431,—burning me alive.
But when your Warwick and
Winchester did it in the old
market-place of Rouen, John
W^fl Bull applauded them to the
echo. Now, that your Tom
Taylor and your Queen's
Councillors burn me, I learn, if I may beiieve your Daily Telegraph,
that John Bull hisses, and will not have it. It is true that, on
making inquiries of some of my good-natured, friends who attended
the ceremony on Easter Monday, and since—for you know one always
has some good-natured friends who can make a pleasure of one's
roasting—I cannot learn that John Bull did or does hiss, audibly,
on the occasion, or if he did or does, I am assured that the hiss was
and is drowned in applause, and that my burning seemed, on the
whole, as might be expected, to give great satisfaction to my
hereditary enemies.
But however this may be, I am anxious to assure you, and my old
and stout enemies, the Rosbifs, through you, that I bear no grudge
to the dramatist, or managers, who have thought proper again to
sentence me to the stake. In fact, I am obliged to them. I am
not ashamed of my martyrdom, but proud of it. The pile was my
stepping-stone to eternal bliss, and undying fame—if I oared for
that. No, my real enemies are those who have questioned if I ever
really was burnt, headed by the impostor who took my name, and
laid claim to my doings some seven years after my death, and I am
ashamed to say took in my king, and even some of my own familv,
though she afterwards owned to her imposture, and so set me right
with my time and all time to come. The ill-turn she did me, has
since been renewed by the poet* and dramatists, who have thought
lit, among many other gross and offensive liberties, taken with my
career, to end it, otherwise than on the pile, some by marrying me,
and some by killing me in battle. Like France, I owe the bitterest
grudge to Germany.
It is Mr. Sctiili.er who has most cnielly wronged me, not only
by making me fall in love—a thing I never did, I am thankful to
say—and with an Englishman—the last man I should have thought
of falling in love with, had I been capable of such a womanly weak-
ness—but by depriving me of my martyr's crown, and shuffling mc
ignominiously out of the world in the muddle of a melfe, like a
common sworder!
I feel deeply grateful to my latest dramatist for at least presenting
the leading events of my life as they happened; for not saddling
me with a lover, and not sparing me trio stake.
Your Daily Telegraph is a great Philistine, and may be expected
to take a Philistine's view of the matter. But in Mr. John Bull,
for all his Warwicks, his Winchesters, and in spite of the hard
treatment your Shakspeare has given me, I always owned a noble
enemy; and I feel I have no reason to complain of his treatment of
me in this the latest chronicle of the Life and Death of
Yours ever,
PLAY-HOUSE CHARGES.
The Correspondence about the extra charges, or as honest persons
call them, the Extortions at theatres is renewed, and there is a
miserable exposure of official greed. But we are happy to know
that the question is about to bo set at rest. A Tariff of Charges has
been agreed upon, and it will shortly be promulgated, that is, hung
up in the entrances and lobbies, and visitors will at all events know
what an evening at the play will cost them. Mr. Punch has been
favoured with an early copy of the tariff, and he subjoins it:—
Play-bill at box-office
Envelope for box-ticket . . . •
Badgea Porter who opens Carriage-door at night . -
H is fee, if Visitor wa Iks
Deposit on leaving Great-coat
Ditto on leaving Umbrella
Deposit by Lady, whatever she leaves . . . •
If she have nothing to leavo
Box-keeper, for eaoh Visitor
Play-bill from him (each Visitor to take one) each
Book of the Words
Fee if Visitor's own Book brought ....
Footstools, each
Refreshments as pertaritf. But for each visit of woman
to say "any refreshments?" . • • •
Fco for information us to when the performances will
bo over
Fco on resuming Great-coat, Cloak, &c. (deposit to be
retained by official) each article . . . .
Fee for walking about Lobby between Acts
Deposit on borrowing Opera-glass
Hireofsamo
Fee on returning same
For peeping through glass in Box-door
For reading Play-bills on Lobby wall . . . .
A Glass of Water, in box
Fee to Attendant bringing it . . . ...
For Visitor's returning to see whether any article has
been left in box .......
Fee on any article so regained
His fee for opening Carriago-door
His fee for shutting Carriage-door ....
HU fee if Visitors' Servant does both . . . .
Fee for waiting till Carriage arrives (each Visitor)
For waiting, if no carriage, and because it rains (each
Visitor)
There may be a few trifling additions to this list, but it is correct in
the main, and as soon as it has received the signatures of such
managers as approve the system, it will be hung up, as above said.
N.B. It is wished to meet a generous public in a liberal spirit, and
therefore the fee for reading the above tariff, when stuck up, will be
optional.

The Brighton Review. 1871. Grant & Co.
Public opinion on the last Review acknowledges the goodness of
the material, but holds that the new Editors lack the faculty of
arrangement. There is little to be learned from columns of figures
drawn up without a definite purpose. Moreover, the imagination is
too much appealed to throughout. We do not know that there
should be congratulation on the singular ahsenee of horsiness, as
there are times for all things. Still, the Number may be called
satisfactory, though needing many corrections

PEG OF PEGWELL BAY.
1 had got the gout,
^ Went to get my leg well;
Found a village ont,
On the bay of Pegwell.
Who knows not that hay?
Ignorance besotted!
Shrimps within it play,
Then are caught and potted.
Shrimps the morning meal
Finish, after egg, well—
Lor! how full I feel,
Breakfasting at Pegwell.
Shrimping go the maids,
Kate, Poll, Loo, and Meggy,
Through the water wades,
Pretty Pegwell Peggy
Neither short nor tall,
Nor a whit too leggy,
Is the girl they call
Pretty Pegwell Peggy.
While I am asleep,
When the day is dawning.
She is in the deep
Shrimping, may he prawning.
O'er the rocks she goes,
Treading Arm, no limping,
Nothing on her toes
Or her legs for shrimping.
Rocks beyond the sands,
She has got to get to,
Baskets in her hands,
And, of course, a net too.
Shrimps she treats like char,
And when she has got 'em,
Peg's the one to ar-
tistically pot 'em.
Some I bite and munch,
And with pleasure suck some;
Waited on at lunch,
By sweet Peg so buxom.
Peg, of Pegwell Bay,
Is so bright and comely,
Beats each corypMe
Of the time of Lttmley.
Bless us! how she smiles!
See the sly-hoots simper,
She my heart beguiles—
Modest Maiden Shrimper!
Yes! whene'er I feel
That I shan't cry, "0! toe!"
Goutless, I will kneel,
Begging for her photo.
But I know I'm shy,
And I cannot beg well,
Never mind, I '11 try—
Pretty Peg of Pegwell!
Shrimps come daily, I
Have my share allotted,
Happy shrimps you 're by
Pegwell Peggy potted!
Shrimps oreate a drought—
Broach a cask or keg! well
Mixed 'twill be, no doubt,
By my Peg of Pegwell!
Ah! I wake one morn,
Miss her pretty curtsey.
Ask, where has Bhe gone?
"Sir, she's gone to Chertsey."
"She's engaged to wed
Andrew James Carneggie"—
I could punch his head!
So farewell to Peggy!

CUEIOUS OLD ROMAN MOSAIC
RECENTLY EXCAVATED ON AN ESTATE IN THE POSSESSION OF
MB. PUNCH.
TO ALL "DEAE BOYS."
"A testimonial" usually proves that the recipient has had suffi-
cient self-esteem to perceive his own merits, and sufficient popu-
larity to induce his friends to understand his hint that those merits
ought to be formally recognised. But there are exceptions to this
rule, and we are going to mention a marked exception. Pooh, we
decline to pursue the topic in a didactic spirit. That there should
be proposal for a Testimonial to ^3ntrtJi> &xttn, and that Mr. Punch
should be out of the business, would be perfectly inconceivable.
Why, has not Mr. Punch been privately enjoving Mr. Green's
pleasantries and hospitalities, and publicly alluding to them in the
most familiar and genial matter, for years? Have not some of
Mr. Punch's meritorious young men written, in the most charming
manner, upon the wholesome festivities over which Mr. Green has
presided? Is not " dear boy" a household word with Mr. Punch.
Go to," then, that is, go to Mr. John Holltngshead at the Gaiety
Theatre, and then, standing up in a gentlemanly attitude, address
that gentleman in an affable and elegant style, to this effect.
"Mr. Hollingshead, Sir, I learn from our friend Mr. Punch
that it is proposed to present Mr. Green with a Memorial of
the general approbation of his management at Evans's, and
specially of his honourable and successful resolve to exclude
from the entertainments anything of a vulgar or otherwise
objectionable sort. Sir, as one who enjoys rational and unvitiated
amusement, and as one who cherishes a hundred agreeable recol-
lections of a place, where, thanks to Mr. Green, no gentleman
is ashamed to be seen, I beg leave to make this (here take outporte-
nwnnaie or cheque) addition to the 'Paddy' Green Fund." If you
''— ~; this by correspondence, you have the address above. To
.vour this appeal with a bit of literature, Mr. Punch "reminds"
you that there was a British poet called Matthew Green, who
wrote in the last century. His memoir states that " he was a man
of great probity and sweetness of disposition, and that his conversa-
tion abounded with wit, but of the most inoffensive kind." Mr.
P. Green might have sat for that portrait, and there is even an
additional likeness, for M. Green wrote a capital poem against what
P. Green has so often helped to cure—the spleen. Matthew wrote—
"Fling but a stone, the giant dies."
He has often died in "those cool halls" by the Piazza, and Mr.
Green has for years officiated at the saorifice. Come, dear public,
remember many a pleasant evening, and help to make Mr. Green's
evening pleasant.

It will. But now that the 1st of May is so near, there is no reason
why Mr. Punch should longer keep the secret which was entrusted
to him in 1861, and which he has resolutely preserved ever since.
He therefore informs Prince Arthur ana the Universe that the
contents of the casket are these. A ring, set with a single diamond,
on which are carved the numerals, 85. With this is a small tablet
of gold, on which is inscribed, Me ttfjat Chine Oracle. H.B.H. will
instantly understand the meaning, and we only add that the oracle,
as also an " Oracle of the Bottle, will be at his servioe whenever he
applies where he is thus mystically told to seek counsel on all the
problems of life. ^SaNCft.

MY HEALTH.
oiiwa to Broadslairs
from Ramsgate. —
Beautiful weather
betweenBroadstairs
and Ramsgate.
Ramsgate has seve-
ral sorts of weather
all at once; and
having paid your
money (for lodgings
or hotel), you can
take your choice.
After meeting
Budd 1 feel better.
I am cheered by the
prospect of Turkish
Baths and probable
reduction. Think,
as I walk on, that
on my return I will
take a more decided
line with my Aunt.
"What the decided
line shall be I don't
exactly sec, but ge-
nerally speaking I
might alter my con-
duct towards her.
For instance, when she's frightened, on meeting me suddenly on
the stairs (we almost live on the stairs, as I am perpetually returning
from going to fetch my Aunt's pocket-handkerchief, and she is as
often coming up after me to tell me that she's found it in the piano),
I can laugh boisterously, and pretend it's good fun. Laugh her out
of her '' nerves" as it were. When she cries, instead of being too
sympathetic, Icansay, ""What's the use of tears! Whygive way?"
which latter arguing sounds like an advertisement, with an answer
after it, telling you now not to give way on the cheapest plan.
Sudden Shock to Nervous System.—There are no railings or posts
along the cliff between Broadstairs and Ramsgate. A meditative
fjrson might easily step over the edge. Very dangerous. Find
've been following a path which actually has been made to lead to
the very verge, and have luckily pulled up short. "What pulled me
up short? Instinct?
Mem. "Write to Mr. Darwin on this subject. "What I want to
draw his attention to is that my mind was occupied with one line of
thought—far away from cliffs and precipices—but that suddenly
Something pulled me up with a jerk and prevented me going over.
I notice a donkey grazing within three inches of the edge. He is
evidently thinking of his dinner. He moves on quietly and fear-
lessly, vegetating. He doesn't even give a side glance at his danger.
He is dining, like Damocles, with the sword over him. Change
"o " into " a," and say sward under him—which suggestion turns
the current of my thoughts. I rise (having seated myself to write
this note for Darwin before I forget it), and leave Damocles the
donkey.
Mem. Before I move on again. People say that when at a dizzy
height one feels an irresistible inclination to throw oneself over. I
don't. Nothing like it. But approaching a trifle too near, I do feel
a sort of vibration somewhere about the knees, something like the
sensation in a nightmare when you 're f alling down-stairs without
your legs. Used I to experience this before living with my Aunt,
Doddridge, Charlie, and the Turtle Dove? Don't think so.
Not a soul to be met. Peacefully quiet. This is Ramsgate-cum-
Broadstairs out of season. Sit down again and think. This process
will restore nerves. But is sitting down good for exercise? Yes;
and go on again, fresher.
Melancholy is marking me for its own. I will sit and write
Thoughts on Waves. Fancv there's some sort of poetic feeling in
me—{Mem. "Write to Mr. Darwin again. Think I could support
his theory with an argument. "Work it out.)—latent, and to be
developed by solitude.

Another Thought on Another Wave.—A feminine wave coming
up with a slight rustle like the sound of a lady's dress—(material
immaterial; never know what ladies' dresses are made of, except
silk). It curtseys, makes a slight advance, then bashfully retreats,
and ... is seen no more.
Wave Number Three.—The cautious wave, which, knowing how
thoroughly out of its element it will be on shore, joins two specula-
tive friends who are making the expedition. The firm (unlimited
liability) reaches the sands, and breaks.
Names for Waves.—The Barber "Waves. They get up a great
lather, then leave the sand clear as a fresh-shaven face.
Leapfrog Waves—which rush after one another, jump on to each
other's backs, fall together, and roll over and over on the shore.
I Notes finished. Rise: with difficulty. Rheumatism? Or obesity?
Horrid word, "obesity." Perhaps rheumatism and obesity. Take
sharp walk on to Broadstairs. Very dull. Wish there was some-
body to talk to. A walking-stick would be a companion. Will pet
one at Broadstairs. Begin to feel hungry. Mustn't eat anything
between breakfast and dinner, if I want to get into good condition.
Yet I should like to commit the enormity (can't help quoting Budd
while I am alone—it seems sociable) of taking a little bread and
cheese and a glass of beer. It ought to be water, not beer; but it
won't matter just for once, as to-morrow I begin Budd's plan, and
take Turkish Baths.
Broadstairs.—Viewed from cliff. Not a soul visible anywhere.
Broadstairs probably at luncheon, or taking a siesta. I feel almost
afraid of stepping in, and disturbing it. Sit on bench, and watch
for signs of life. . . . Two figures emerge from somewhere in the
; town. ... I am interested. . . . They disappear above . . . they
I re-appear below, on the sands, where tney at once lie at full length.
One is in a bright blue blouse, and the other in a whitish coat.
i "Who? ... On further inspection .... there is no doubt of it. . .
they are the Butcher and the Baker, of Broadstairs, and this is all
j they've got to do.
I I walk on. To the hotel. From the coffee-room window I have a
full view of the parade (?), and on the coffee-room walls I can amuse
j myself with prints of Hogarth's Marriage a la Mode. Children
'and nurses appear on parade; also two Bath chairs with invalids.
Plenty of invalids here, probably. Bantingising or Vegetarian-
ising: which would account for the idleness of the Buteher and
Baker, still lying at full length on the sands, where I view them
again while lunche n is being prepared.
It is quite refreshing to talk to anyone. To the Barmaid, for
example, after the silent walk. I say, "Good day." So does she.
I ask what there is for luncheon, as a sort of fa<;on de parler. She
shows me a glass-case with curiosities in beef, mutton, chicken, and
something bony, with a good deal of fat, also a faded ham. I feel
inclined to say, "Ah! very interesting!" as if I was examining a
museum. "Any fish?'" No; of course no fish, being at the sea-
side. "Well, then, I will commit the enormity or bread and cheese.
She retires, sulkily, I think, as much as to say, " Is that all you've
como for P Really to oblige her, and get her to be chatty (merely
for sociability's sake) I would willingly commit other enormities,
such as chicken, salad, soup, and a bottle of the Best. No: will
restrain myself: remember, a Constitutional is my object, not
luncheon. I ask her. pleasantly, "Many people herer" She
replies, unpleasantly, Yes," and I don't believeTier. I say, more
pleasantly . . . (Mem. Conversation is quite an art. Wasn t there
some one called "Conversation Tommt ?—friend of George the
Fourth's. Think so. . . . But you must have two to a conversa-
tion as to a quarrel.) "You can t be doing much business note, out
of the season P" which is intended to veil a complimentary allusion
to their vast business hi the season. She replies, curtly, "Quite as
much as we want;" and resumes some knitting, or stitching. Ah!
"Well . . . will go and buy a walking-stick.
Noticeable features at Broadstairs.—All the shops do each other's
business. An unsettled trade, as much as to say " We'll see what
sells best, and then stick to that." For instance, the tobacconist sells
walking-sticks. At the photographer's you can get boots. At the
boot-maker's there is a fine collection of photographs, chiefly of
people celebrated at Broadstairs, or celebrated for being at Broad-
stairs. Perhaps they'd be glad of mino as "A Visitor to Broadstairs.
At the hatter's they deal in petticoats and crinolines. At the
draper's there are valentines, music, and I think cheap toys.
The only shop which appears to be doing a fixed business is a small
sweet-shop, in a passage leading to and from the Parade. Passing
on to the Parade, I look over on to the sands. Butcher and Baker
still at full length. Children are coming out in great numbers.
This accounts for the thriving state of the sweet trade, and the
indolence of the Butcher and Baker; though, by the way, one can-
not arrive at any definite conclusion from this, as it is probably,
from their mode of doing things at Broadstairs, that when they re
at home, the Baker is a fishmonger, and the Buteher deals in
vegetables, and perhaps lets out Bath-chairs. Perhaps the Uutcner
and Baker, having nothing to do, are making arrangements tor an

out. Three more Bath-chairs. Finished. Walk out. Look over cliff.

Tea-time probably. Take Bame seat as before; a bench commanding

full length. They came at two, it is now 4"30. I've got two hours
before me to dinner-time. Wonder how long they (the Butcher and
Baker) will stop on the sands.
The Butcher and Baker were two pretty men,
They lay on the sands till the clock Btruck ten.
Up jumps the Baker, and looks at the sky,
"0 brother Butcher, the moon's very high."
Five o' Clock.—Baker sitting up. Butcher sitting up, too, stretch-
ing. Both stretch: rise, and lounge off. Evidently tea-time.
Perhaps (on the Mutual Subsistence Co. idea) the Baker gives the
Butcher tea, finding muffins, crumpets, and toast, the Grocer bring-
ing in tea and sugar, and the Milkman milk, as their share of the
risk. Dinner arrangement would be Butcher gives dinner (that is,
meat) to the company, the Greengrocer finding potatoes, the Baker
bread, the Publican beer, and the Confectioner would come in with
the tarts. I fancy that the Greengrocer would get the best of it.
I follow their example, and disappear. I return to Ramsgate.

Bad Advice.
How hostile to Temperance and Teetotalism Pope
seems to have been! Not content (as we have before
pointed out with the finger of scorn) to urge his readers
to "drink deep," he must needs go on to inculcate the
pernicious doctrine that "drinking largely sobers us
again." Monstrous!

Friend "Well, well, tou must Make Allowances for them. It is

THE KIND PAPA.
A certain noble Lord is said to have declared himself "an
Englishman, if you please, but first of all a Catholic." This descrip-
tion may also be applicable to the English noblemen and gentlemen
of the Roman Obedience, who lately went to visit the Pope at Rome,
and offer him condolence and Peter s Pence. Still, though no doubt
they are ardent Catholics, perhaps their Catholicism is very mainly
an idea connected with Crusaders and coats of arms. But the Past's
Own Correspondent at the Capital of Italy, writing on the fifth
instant, in making the subjoined statement respecting those devotees,
probably confounded them with others:—
"But I must return to the Catholic deputies of Old England, with the
dolorous confession that on Monday morning instead of going on a pilgrimage
to the Seven Churches, or ascending the Scala Santa on their knees, the
majority of the gentlemen, hearty sportsmen at home no doubt, attended the
last meet for this season of the Roman hounds at Cento Cello, three miles
beyond the Porta Moggiore."
"May it please your Holiness," those Nobility and Gentry, whoever
they were, might have said, in a manner reversing the speech of the
Peer above-quoted, '' we are Catholics if you like, but first of all Fox-
hunters." We in England have no racing in Passion Week; but
they at Rome had their Meet—even in deepest Lent. Naturally
enough, perhaps, the Pope would not understand such disciples;
and had they really been the deputies referred to in the Post, nooody
could be surprised by the further information, that:—
"The defection of his British sympathisers afflicted Pio Nono, who observed
•odly to Monsiqnore Nardi, when that prelate attended for his usual early
audience yesterday morning, 1 These blessed English are incomprehensible.'
The Holy Father does, however, appear to have understood how
to make himself agreeable to Englishmen. We trust there is no
mistake in what follows:—
"At 11*30 a.m. yesterday his Holiness received the members of tho British
deputation of Catholics . . . These gentlemen had the honour of accompany-
ing the Pope in his daily promenade round tho gardens, and I am informed
that he even caused some excellent cigars to be presented to them."
Even Protestants who cannot admit the Pope to be precisely what
St. Peter was as to the Sacred Edifice, will not, if themselves of the
right sort, deny him to be at least a Brick. To provide cigars for
his visitors was unquestionably to act in a way meritorious of that
title; behaviour worthy of a truly venerable old Pontiff and Gentle-
man. It is not every Father that will encourage his sons to smoke.
No doubt the cigars he gave them were first-rate, although, reading
on, we learn that:—
"The Pope himself only smokes the little Spanish paglittta cigars."
Nevertheless, it may well be supposed that he knows how to
choose a cigar, and is a good judge of tobacoo at least, if not abso-
lutely infallible. You have seen, perhaps, in tobacconists' Bhops,
canisters labelled " Pacha's Mixture." Would it not be a good idea
for a Tobacconist, being also a Papist, to advertise a "Papa's
Mixture," likewise? By the help of a cigarette the Sovereign Pontiff
is probably enabled to contemplate his situation with equanimity.
As an aid to reflection, his smoke may assist him to see that the loss
of his Temporal Power has rendered the British Public indifferent to
the repeal of tho Ecclesiastical Titles' Act. Sir George Bowyer
may trust that he makes himself very comfortable. But note a fact
for the Anti-Tobacco Society. The Pope smokes. "No wonder!"
scream all the parochial old women, who would shriek for the ex-
pulsion of a Curate supposed to smoke. You, who are not of their
mind, would like to see Pio Nono behind a pipe. Especially would
you admire him in that position, if that Pipe were the Pipe of Peace,
and his vis-d-vit Victor-Emmanuel.

TO CORRESPONDENTS.
It is with the utmost reluctance that Mr. Punch ever admits
into his columns a reference to merely vulgar crime. There are
other tribunals to deal with that. Will a great number of corre-
spondents forgive him for not complying with the desire they
express, with much honourable indignation, that he will "scourge"
the creature, who, in a Republican journal, has outraged the feelings
of all decent persons, highly or lowly placed, by a brutal reference
to the recent sorrow of the Princess of Wales. He would not have
even alluded to the atrooity, but that it has been transferred, with
fitting disgust, from the paper in whioh it appeared to a journal read
by respectable persons. The skunk has its place in natural history,
but it is not a desirable subject for close investigation.
WESTMEATH IN SOUTHYANKEELAND.
Certain American papers have been lecturing England, lately,
upon the amount of crime in these islands, especially Ireland, and
upon the inefficiency of our old-fashioned laws, which prevent liigh-
handed dealing with scoundrelism. We are advised to adapt our
legislation to the necessities of the age. For which good advice
we are as grateful as all rational people should be, and as some
rational people are, for wise counsel. Also for wise example, as
the way in which an atrocious brigand, named Gutcchi, was lately
snared and polished off in Italy by Carabinieri disguised as peasants.
This was a neat operation, and might afford a bint to any Govern-
ment that really wished to put down agrarian assassination in West-
meath. But we chiefly desire to express our warmest acknowledg-
ments to our Yankee friends for their advice, which they are all the
better entitled to give, their own dealings with criminals being so
prompt and satisfactory. From a late number of the New York
Tribune, a most worthy journal, we extract these lines, and then
we make our bow:—
"That men are daily killed throughout most of the Southern States
because they are Republicans, is just as sure as the fact that those States were
lately the arena of a great civil war. There have been not less than
Fivf. Thousand Neoroes killed, because of their colour and their politics,
in those States since General Grant's election; and not ons white

"Eecent events in Europe should teach us to rely—not on treaties, for they

were produced which shook the confidence of every honest politician, but
upon ourselves. We should take measure of ourselves, we should know what

at which it had been held through many generations."—Mr. Goschen's

All through with tfts-union; yet temper and tact is

You handled with vigour the massed fact and figure—

Poured oil, 'tother night, on Gladstonian rigour;
Touched the Robinson row without making it bigger;
And so asked for excuse that the House didn't grudge it.
You don't take for lee-board a high or low free-board;
A Reed care no rush for; have no call to lean on one;
You don't raise a storm in each cup on the tea-board.

And better and better, in spirit, not letter.

Whose sound in old times could cow wrong's arm'd abettor,
And nerve the slave's heart 'neath the weight of his fetter,

As Nelson and Wellington felt you have spoken;
Bade us bear the old heart, and, if need be, so stir it,—
As behind oaken topsides, inside iron turret,—
That its shot shall be feared, and its bulwarks unbroken.
There's "buncombe," there's boasting,—stale butter with toasting,—
But this, by Lord Hatherley's leave, we hold neither;
Not all England yet is on Mammon's road posting,

Of hucksters, small wits, or Lord Chancellors* either.
The word may be French-bred, the thing ship and trench-bred,

But not less in the mart, in the shop, on the bench, bred,
Of the pride to dishonour that never would blench bred,

With a hand that's not hasty, a head that's not featherly,

The first blast in a good cause well-blown, is the rout on't—
And prove he obtained treasure's worth for his treasure.

days, for six whole weekB. But the idea of such an awful and protracted
slavery was too much for most of the House, and the attendance was very thin.
The debate was on Army Reorganisation and about putting the Volunteers
under the Mutiny Act. There seems some idea that they will dislike this, but
surely only those who wish to plav at soldiers will object to it. The real
Braves will say with Lord Childe Harold Byron,
"Britons rarely swerve
From law, however stern, that tends their strength to nerve."
On proceeding to the Estimates, becoming reference was made by the Minister
to the sudden and lamented death of the lately appointed Judge-Advocate-
General, Me. John Robert Davison, M.P. for Durham. He was an able man,
who worked his way to success, and must have deserved it, for it estranged no
friends from him.
The Trades' Union Bill (the criminal moiety of the new enactment), was
passed, with the delicate titular alteration which seems to have given satisfac-
tion to the parties concerned. Himself a perfect master of language, Mr.
Punch has no objection to any verbal refinements, and if it be more agreeable
to the feelings of a person who takes away Mr. Punch's pocket-handkerchief
to be termed an unauthorised re-arranger of property than to be styled Fur,
Mr. Punch would concede the phrase, provided the Beaks understand it.
There was also discussion on the Bills of Exchange Bill (well, we can't help
Parliamentary clumsiness of expression), and it was suggested that all Days of
Grace should be done away. These days were originally a mere favour, but
they have become a right. There are none in France, where there used to be 10,
but the Code Napoleon cleared all that away. In Lisbon there are 15, and the
same is the rule in Rio de Janeiro; in fact, we suppose that in such places
people take up bills or not, just as it may happen, and soorn to be bothered
about dates. The matter does not seem of much consequence; perhaps it
would be a graceful concession to Sabbatarianism to provide that, if a bill fell
due on Sunday, it should not be paid at all; but we only toss this out as an
obiter dictum.
Tuesday. The "Westmeath Report has been made, and it reveals a terrible
system of organised murder, into which, however, enters the odd element called
Irishism. One witness tells us of a gentleman who was marked out to be shot,
but some peasant whom he had obliged gave him warning. Let me prosecute
the intending murderer." "No, your honour, I couldn't give evidence agin
him; but you have always been kind to me and mine, and I '11 shoot him for
your honour." Mr. Gladstone had not had time to consider what measure
should be adopted to put an end to the system. He is a great friend of Italy.
Let him write in his choice Italian " to Victor-Emmanuel's Chief of Police
for a few hints as to the way in which brigands are detected and extirpated.
Now, Mr. Charles Reed, M.P. for Hackney, and son to one of the best men
that have lived among us, why are you disquieting us about the Sunday
Delivery of letters in the country? Granted that 2(^000 postmen cannot
comfort of millions? Mr. Punch is not going to argue
the matter, but affirms distinctly that he means to pro-
tect the nation from a recurrence of the calamities and
annoyances of the year 1850, when a similar agitation
against Sunday delivery was made, and Lord John
Russell determined to give us a taste of what Sabba-
tarianism really meant. Was there not confusion and
dismay all over the land, was not Martha Struggles
nearly divorced, was not the Government compelled by
nearly one unanimous Howl to replaoe things as they
were before the change? The question has been sent to
a Committee, which we hope means that it is shelved,
but, anyhow, the Sunday Delivery in the country must
not be stopped.
We then had disquisitions on the reason why Sir
Spencer Robinson oeased to control the Navy. Every-
thing desirable was said in regard to that gentleman's
ability and intentions, and Mr. Punch will only remark
that when Falkland led his dear Serena through her
new domain. With fond surprise that lady soon descried,
A temple raised to her ^Etherial guide (not Falkland),
And saw two meeting arms a tablet raise, Deoked with
these lines, the moral of Ma. William Hay/ley's lays :—
"Virtue's an ingot of Peruvian gold,|
Sense the bright ore Potosi'B mines unfold;
But Temper's image must their use create,
And give these preoious metals sterling weight."
The discussion, however, took a form which induoed Mr.
Gladstone to consider that the House ought to express
itself, in form, against any further inquiry, and, insisting
on a division, Government triumphed by 153 to 104.'.
Wednesday. Game Laws debate, and Mr. P. Taylor's
Bill for the abolition of those laws rejected by 172 to 49.
There were some stupid things and some rude things said,
as might be expected on a sporting topic, and the Minis-
ters were described by one Member as "anything but a
sporting lot." This was meant as a sneer, and Squire
Western would have approved it. But a man need not
be effeminate, or a muff, because he has but moderate
pleasure in murdering poultry. Mr. Gladstone went to
Hawarden for his holidays, and he amused himself with
his favourite hatchet, and, according to a correspondent,
felled a large tree without assistance. To fell a large tree
requires strength, skill, courage, and perseverance; and
Mil. Gladstone, having all these, can also read and
understand a book, oonduct a logical argument, and
quote the olassios; feats which would puzzle a good many
constituents of the "sporting lot." But on the main
question of the Game Laws, there is a good deal to be
said which is not going to be said here. Mr. Punch
sees small force in the argument that the Game Laws
ought necessarily to be repealed, because only respectable
people approve and obey them. That is trash. But
like most of our other laws, they are capable of almost
indefinite improvement, and what Mr. Punch desires
in them is Justice and no Sentimentality.
Thursdau. The Lords returned to their Legislative
duties, and Lord Redesdale, who has, we are happy
to say, recovered from the bite of the shepherd's dog,
resumed his work as Shepherd of Committees, and was
warmly received by his flock.
Pleasing information having arrived as to the results
of the High Joint Commission in America (it was said
that Mr. Fish had settled the Fisheries), Lord Gran-
ville declined to confirm an unofficial report. We
are happy to state that he looked very cheerful, and
not as if a Black Ox had trodden on his mouth, or a
Brown Horse had trodden on his foot. By the way,
this was a singularly ungracious act on the part of the
latter beast, for Lord Granville never treads on any-
body's corns. However, perhaps he has none himself.
The corn crop has been very scant of late years, since
men left off wearing tight boots, and perhaps to this
fact is due the general good temper observable in the
men of the period.
In the Commons, the Chancellor op the Exchequer
introduced his JSuogrt.
Mr. Punch needs no tight boot to make him speak of
this Budget in the way it deserves. His difficulty is to
restrain his just and noble anger.
Mr. Lowe has managed to show a Deficiency of
£2,713,000. This is not his fault. It is nobody's fault.
Money has been weU laid out on our Defences.
But how does he raise the sum wanted? Why, of
attend morning service at church or chapel, is that much of a sacrifice to the I course, by increasing the Income-tax. He raises it

from £1 13*. 4d. in the £100 to £2 4s. And thus he rests nearly all
the required amount out of the real Working Class, the people who
pay an unjustly regulated tax. He takes £1,950,000 from us.
As for the comparatively small sum left, he obtains that by alter-
ing the Probate, Legacy, and Succession Duties.
And—it is not a joke—he imposes a Tax on Lucifer Matches! It
is true. Every box of 100 common matches ia to bear a Halfpenny
Stamp, and every box of 100 wax matches, or fusees, is to bear a
Penny Stamp. He believes that he shall get £550,000 in this way.
And he carried this proposition, after a long debate, in which he
was considerably chaffed. Mi. ThxoN, Member for Birmingham,
divided the House on the Match Box question, and was defeated by
201 to 44.
We were far too much displeased witih him aborit the Two
Millions of Income-tax to be sportive over his Match Box, until we
recollected that on it he proposes to print the motto, Ex htee hiccl-
lum. "Show me ohUdren, and do what you like with me," Baid
Mr. Bucket. "** Show me Latin, and you put me in a good temper,"
says Mr. Pwroh. The literal translation of "the words is, " A small
gain out of light." Mr. Lowe has made but a small gain out of the
light he has had on political economy; but let that pass.
Friday. The Lords read a Dover Harbour Bill. It includes, we
believe, a valuable clause, prohibiting Mayors, and the like, from
going down to the 'harbour, and showing Dover taste by reminding
royal exiles of happier days.
Mfc. White gave notice of War on the Budget. So did Mr.

Gladstone indignantly denied it, and asked whetheT that was
to be used about .those who had made Russia eat her own
it. We finished with a.tow over the Match-boxes, the most creditable
part whereof was the manifestation of feeling on behalf of the very
poor, who make matches. Do readers know that babies of two
years old work at the ooxes? Jt is asserted fhtrt the tax will
operate even to the discouragement of these mites. Nobody, of
course, believed that who voted in the majority that carried
Mr. Lowe's resolution
MORE RED FINANCE.
'The Income-tax payers have not been disappointed in the expec-
tation that they would have the honour of defraying the by far
greater portion of the increased estimates. As £2,250,000 direct
taxation is to £550,000 indirect, so is their share of that honour to<
the proportion enjoyed by the community at large, with the addi-'
tion, on the part of many of them, of increased Succession and
Legacy Duty levied on their inheritance. People say that the finan-
cial prospects of the nation are gloomy; hut Mr. Lowe's Budget, as
an earnest of future taxation, is all couhur de rose, that is to say,
the red rose. Indeed, if Mr. Lowe pleased to make himself so
agreeable as to oblige the House of Commons with a song some night,
he could express a truth prettily by singing a parody on " My Love
«* Wee the Red Red Rose," substituting My Budget" for "My
Love." What can be Redder than the imposition of taxes mainly
on a single class, except the confiscation of that one set of people's
entire property? "There's a good time coming, boys." If you
don't; want your incomes exceptionally taxed, don't make money
otherwise than by manual labour; and if you don't wish your chil-
dren, or brothers and sisters, to be fined for the public benefit, on
the amount you may leave them, don't put by
Epigram on the Budget.

Memorandum for Managers.
The Managers of Playhouses are_ wont to announce that their
theatres are nightly crowded. This information makes all who hate
to be stifled, and will go to see only a probably good performance,
stop away. 'Unintelligent audiences, and pieces to suit them, are
thus perpetuated.
THE DRAMA OF THE FUTURE.
tjnch, Sir, we are presented
with one more instance of
a good tragedy, wherein
there iB no love. May we
not hope for a good comedy
also, in which that passion
will be conspicuous by its
absence P It the stage is
really to hold the mirror
up to Nature, as Nature
is, and indeed to show the
very age and body of the
time, its form and pres-
sure, yes.
In the week next to
Easter, this year, the flood
of marriages, pent up
during Lent, did not rush
down the Times in any-
thing like its usual- cata-
ract. On one day the
birthswere forty-two only,
the deaths as many as
fifty-three, the marriages
not moro than twenty.
The connection whiohyou have pointed out between this sort of
ratio and the Married Women's Property Aot doubtless-exists. But
a concurrent cause of the deolining marriage-rate I believe to be the
cessation of love among the generality of at least tie higher and
middle classes. There are exceptional lovers, by their associates
commonly called spooney, whence we see that they are exceptions
that prove a rule.
■Several causes have combined to abolish love. One of them I
believe to be the immense prevalence of smoking amongst young
men. If love does not put a man's pipe out, his pipe puts out love;
and a cigar has the same effeot. For smoking not only calms passion,
but also aids thought; hence, perhaps, the habit of deep reflection
for whioh most men are now-a-days remarkable.
Another oause is, probably, the air of indifference to the regard of
men which girls generally affect, if they feel it not, in their manners
and style or dress; the former being characterised by levity, and
the latter by ostentation. Female attire, moreover, although snowy,
is little decorative, and very costly indeed; helps, therefore, to ex-
tinguish any spark of love which a youth may contract. "What is
the use," he thinks, " of loving her whom I can't afford to marry?"
Now, then, that love has become an anachronism, it should be
exhibited on the stage only in dramas which refleot the state of

or a farce, if employed at all, it ought to be treated as simply aosun
and the piece which inoludes it should terminate with the joke of a
broken-off engagement: the lovers agreeing to shake hands and
part, whilst a light father says, "Be happy." This improvement
of the Drama would gratify men of a certain age, who, under cir-
cumstances, occasionally find themselves at a theatre, and whom
experience has taught that matrimony, at best, is very temporary
beatitude. They are disgusted at seing youth of either sex,
especially their own, invited to believe a delusion which all those
who do live to be undeceived; except in the case of a person always
remaining, C<elbbs.
P.S. The diminution in the Times marriage-list may suggest some
hope that a stop will be put to the destruction of woods, and the
enclosure of commons, which have been caused by the spread of
population. But it is to be feared the lower orders go on as
"MIST, MIST, O MIST!"
It having been announced that the Emperor Napoleon and his
family, desiring to effect an escape from the impertinence of British
vulgarians, were about to reside at Whitby, the Situation, a French
journal published here, observes:—
"We do not doubt that CMselhurst will soon be deserted; but we do not
think it, guests will leave it in order to retire still further into the mists of
Albion."
We compliment the Frenoh scribe upon his admirable acquaint-
ance with geography. Chiselhurst he evidently knows to be a place
on the edge of the sea, while Whitby is, he is equally aware, in the
heart of a woody region. The " mists" are in the French Cockney's
brain.
Humility Itself—Considering.—" None ought to aspire to be
wiser than the laws."

This announcement was officially made last week:—
"A paragraph has lately appeared in seYeral journals giving the description
of a casket, which it is supposed that the late Di ke op Wellington left
Prince Arthur, with directions that it should be opened when His Royal
Highness came of age. We hare been assured that this story has no founda-
tion whaterer, but is the creation of some imaginative brain.
Notwithstanding this contradiction, Mr. Punch adheres (like a
limpet on a rock) to the statement which he had the honour of
making. There is such a casket, and the oontents are what he de-
scribed. This will be proved in proper time. The contradiction was
suddenly and rather unadvisedly put out on the appearance of Mr.
Lowe's Budget, and the announcement of his artful device in regard
to inherited property. But all this will be made smooth, and Mr.
Punch merely adds, "Wait and see." The Court Circular will tell
a very different story, at no remote date.

hat a nuisance a
walk back again is!
Becoming melan-
choly and nervous
once more. Pro-
spect of dinner with
my Aunt. What I
should like would
be a jovial party.
Something to star|
one up. That's
what My Health
requires. Stirring
up. I pause in
front of the new
hotel. East Cliff.
Striking. Hand-
some. First idea
seems to be that a
lot of people in a
row of Gothic pri-
vate houses thought
they 'd knock down
all the partition
walls, and live
happily together.
Second idea seems
to have been," Let's
make it a hotel."
Response, "Let'a."' Other subsequent ideas appear to have been,
impulsively. " Let's build a smoking-room on.the roof! Let's put
up a flag! I" Then, rushing down-stairs again, "Let's make a
croquet-ground!!!" Then, when out of doors, "Let's have a
refreahment-wam, to save going into tint hotel again!!!!" Then.
'• Let's have a tunnel under the oliff to the sands. 0 let's!!!!!
And, magnificent conception, " Let'» pull down the cliff!!!!!!"
Apparently, carried nem. con. Then, being on the sands, "What a

able, =*Let 's have a Restaurant on the sands, led up to by tunnel,
and by oarriage-road made in the olifFwhen they'venearly pulled
down .the cliff and built up a strong wall!"
Next Step.—Somebody who didn't play croquet and didn't care
about^walking, exclaims, "Let's have a Rotten Row!!" Resolu-
tion, with amendment, of "With trees on either side, as on the
Boulevards." Carried again, nem. con. Then somebody, an invalid,
who didn't want to cross the sea, suggested sulphur baths. So they
all said "Let's" again; and Budd tells me that here are the Turkish,
and the sulphurs (not yet finished), and the Secretary to explain
everything generally, to whom and a friend, he (Budd) is talking as
they come up towards me,while I am standing surveying the mighty
whole, admiringly.
Budd's friend is a sporting man of the tight trouser order. Budd
tells me (privately afterwards, on my inquiring something about his
friend, whom I think I know by sight) that "he" (his friend Joslyn)

gathe:
all his money out of him.
Budd informs me that they, he and Joslyn, are going to commit
the enormity of dining at the Cramville. Just what I should like.
I But the fact is—my Aunt
"0!" exclaims Budd, as if he'd known her for years, "she won't
mind.Say it's to meet Banting."
Josltn seconds the invitation, and the Storetary (of course quite
an unbiassed individual) suggests, in an offhand way, as if he was
patronising the establishment out of kindness, that we might do
worse. I make one difficulty hesitatingly, i.e. I must let them know
I'm not coming. "Send a boy>" .say8 Budd. The Secretary is of
opinion, doubtfully, and still only in the character of a casual visitor
and ^unconnected with the interior economy of the hotel, that
"Yes—oh—there's some one you can send," and then resumes an
explanation, which my appearance had interrupted, as to how a
certain Verandah had been put up in two weeks, a feat apparently
unequalled in the annals of building, painting, and decorating, and
which they'd never have done without him, the Secretary, who
kept 'em at it. We congratulate him on the verandah. Budd
observes that it " gives quite a "and finishes his sentence with a
flourish of his stick, to which the Secretary replies, Yes, doesn't
it P" and Joslyn, who has never set eyes on the place before,
remarks that that s just what was wanted. I add " Yes, decidedly,
and to show that I have interested myself in the matter, turn to the
Secretary and inquire, "Only a fortnight?" To which he returns.
I "Only a fortnight," whereupon I say Indeed!" and we all stand
stock still, and, having nothing better to do, stare at the verandah
for about three minutes.
Then Budd observes decisively, that " It 'a a great improvement,"
and the Secretary, really pleased, says, "Yes, isn't it; only a fort-
night." To which Joslyn, by way of variation, returns, "But,
I suppose you made 'em stack to it." This causes the Secretary to
shake his head knowingly, as much as to say, "Didn't I PI should
rather say I did," when Budd throws in, as if skilled in these
matters, Sharp work, a fortnight," and nods fiercely. The Secre-
tary answers interrogatively, Yes, wasn't it?" And I (feelinjr
bound to join in, or he might think I differed with him, and wasn't
pleased with his efforts) answer positively, and as summing up
the whole case, "Yes, it was."
We spend about half an hour surveying the verandah, and play-
ing this sort of languid conversational battledore and shuttlecock
always with the same shuttlecock, when I conclude that it is time
to write to my Aunt. Daren't return home and say cheerfully,
"Going to dine out to-night," as I know she'd shed floods of tears,
and I should be upset for a week. No, in the interests of My Health,
1 will dine with fresh companions and write (after some considera-
tion) to my Aunt.
Letter {carefully considered) to my Aunt:—
"Dear Aunt,—lam very sorry," was very nearly putting " deuced
sorry," but " sorry " won't do in any case. Begin again, not scratch-
ing out, but on another sheet. "My Dear Aunt"—" My" is more
affectionate—"lam very much grieved"—no, that'll frighten her,
and she'll think there's been an accident. Recommence—"My
dearest Aunt"—I have two other aunts, so that the superlative is
correct and complimentary, besides being conciliatory^—-"J am very
much afraid that I shall not be able to return in time fur dinner
to-night"—she'll naturally ask why I stopped on my roatf to write?
Can't help it, will send it at last moment just as we 're sitting down,
and risk it,—" as I have met a man whom I have: noti seen for
rears,"—dash "years" underneath strongly. If it means Joslyn,
've never seen him before—" and a very old friend—meaning Budd

vague "or so, but leaves a margin for after- dinnerr—
Hoping "—-I" am just going to add " that you ai
not— that this will cause you no •'-
very Affectionate Nephetv, Gsoitejc."
Budd comt-smand says " Wittles," and: finding myletterflnished,
sends it by Hunt, the Porter, to whom I give a shilEng, and we are
all jovial.
Mem. Another peculiarity about Budd. He is a capital fellow
for any place. Always knows who everybody is, and gives you their
style, title, and occupation, all compact. For instance, Task, Who's
that ?" meaning the Secretary of Verandah fame. That Budd in-
forms me, is " Mr. Davati, the Secretary." The man at the door
who has gone with my letter is "Hunt, the Porter." The oivil and
most obliging young gentleman in the bar is " Whsxet, the Clerk."
Then there's, when we go to wash our hands, "Mas. ParmcEB, the
Housekeeper," and " Jane, the Chambermaid." A man comes with
the Secretary into the Coffee-room— Who's that?
Mem. You get, out of season at Ramsgate, in a ehronio state of
asking, "Who's that?" arrivals being interesting.
"That?" says Budd, then after looking round,_he

bows. He (therefore) interests us deeply—" Who is her" "He?"
says Budd, "Why;" here he takes another look at him, and either
recognises hi™ or .invents the name on the spur of the moment—
"That's Hooker, the Chemist."
Here we arrive at our second glass of sherry after the fish, and I
observe

of view, "very beautiful eye's."
"Hasn't she!" exclaims Budd. "I say, you must go in for tiie

when I have reduced my tendency to stoutness, I can take the
earliest opportunity of getting an introduction to the young lady
with the beautiful eyes, and establishing myself as a successful
rival to old Pill-Box, i.e. Hooker, the Chemist, who, after all, as far
as we've seen from our window, has only taken his hat off to her
most respectfully.
We continue our dinner. Everything very good, when it arrives.
We have to wait some time between the courses, owing, it appears,
to its being the first night of the table d'hote—by way of experi-
ment—and more people have patronised it than they had expected.
This distracts the waiters.

corner is plaintive, the other, by the fire, is peremptory, and
evidently not to be trifled with. He is trifled with, however. It
appears that he has ordered his favourite dish, a veal cutlet, and
instead of that they have brought him a ham sandwich. On his
remonstrating violently, the waiter disappears with the ham, and
soon after another enters with a dish of fish, which he places before
him.
"What the deuce is this?" says the man by the fire.
"Didn't ye orther fish, Sorr P" asks a most polite waiter of Irish
extraction.
"No," replies the visitor savagely. "I "when he is inter-

Joslyn whispers to us that we (our party) have had that party

man by the fire to place it before the famished sufferer.

at any rate,begins, "But, I say, waiter, I ordered"

We read that, lately, a multitude of simpletons at Derby united
in an Anti-Vaccination demonstration to celebrate the release from
gaol of a tobacconist named Clarke, "whose devotion to anti-
vaccination," says the report of this tomfoolery, had "resulted in
his incarceration for fourteen days in the county gaol." They formed
a procession headed by a Scotch piper playing a national air; and
"there was also a lad in front waving the Bid Republican flag." Do
the donkeys of Derby want the Scarlet Fever as well as th^Small-
pox P Are they not contented with the breaking-out they have got?

AMERICAN ENGLISH.
Speaking of the Americans (U.S.) the Times very
justly says,—"We must leam wherein we offend our
neighbours." There are at least two particulars wherein
it is likely that the higher portion of the English Press
highly offends them. One is that of never using the
Americanism "reliable." Another point is avoidance
of tie other Americanism, to " claim, in the sense of to
allege. But they should consider how very common both
these Americanisms are in all those numerous English
newspapers, the level of whose style is adapted to that
of the intelligence and refinement of the mignty masses.

OBSERVATIONS BY A COCKNEY NATURALIST.
A Nightingale has been heard singing in Kensington Gardens
(Vide Times, April 19.) A salmon has been seen swimming close to
London Bridge. A trout has been observed (reposing on a marble
slab) near to Charing Cross. Sticklebacks have been captured in
the waters of the Serpentine. Plovers' eggs have been discovered
in the middle of Covent Garden: 1 myself have found there as
many as two dozen in a single walk. There is a rookery in St.
Giles's, well known to the police. I have seen a pigeon shot not far
from Shepherd's Bush, and I have heard one has been plucked by a
member of the hawk tribe at another West-End haunt. Black-
beetles are common in the back-kitchens of Belgravia, and blue-
bottles abound among the butchers of Whiteohapel during the warm
months. There is another kind of flv, which is said to he indigenous
to the stables of the jobmasters, and which also may be seen by ob-
servant Cockney naturalists, but less seldom in Whiteohapel than
near the Regent's Park. Sparrow-olubs have not been established
yet in London, but pea-shooters are common in many of its streets.
I am told that early risers may hear a male canary singing in the
neighbourhood of Islington at four o'olock, A.M., and may also hear
a cock crow any morning, except Sunday, between five and six
o'clock. The thrush has been observed among sundry of the children,
under medical inspection, in the nurseries and infant hospitals of
town. Little ducks are plentiful in the salons of "Tyburnia, and in
Bayswater and Brompton there are numbers of great geese. Welsh
rabbits may be seen close to Covent Garden, ana wila turkeys have
been noticed even in the Strand, hanging by the beak. In the pur-
lieus of St. Stephen's, where are the sacred haunts of the Collective
Wisdom of the kingdom, I have heard the hootings of many an old
owl. From information which I have received from members of the
Metropolitan Police, I may assert that larks are common in the
Haymarket, and that on the shores of the silver Thames, at Wap-
ping there is frequently observable a goodly flock of mudlarks.
From s milar information, I may add that there are careful observers
in the streets who rarely pass a day without their setting their eyes
upon a robbin'. Who shall say that in the very midst of the metro-
polis there.is not abundant evidence of a truly rural, and a tooral-
looral life?
POLYSYLLABLE MADE EASY.
The Parisian Commune desired "a Synallagmatic Amnesty."
Long words are dear to low people. This long word need not bother
anybody. If Mr. and Mrs. Naqqleton should ever quarrel again
(which is impossible), and on making peace Mr. N. should promise
her a trip to Brussels, and Mrs. N. should promise him to give up
friendship with Mrs. (anybody he dislikes), that arrangement
would be Synallagmatic; that is, it would imply reciprocal obliga-
tions. How charming is instruction given in a silvered pill!
LATEST BULLETIN.
On Thursday, April the 20th. the Royal Society were so indiscreet
as to allow a paper to be read before them entitled "Note on the
Circumstances of the Transits of Venus over the Sun's Disk in the
Years 2004 and 2012." The public will not be surprised to hear that
we have since thought it our duty to make daily inquiries as to the
state of Dr. Cttmming, who, we regret to add, has been totally pro-
strate, and utterly unable to attend to his affairs, in consequence of
this audacious anticipation of events. The last accounts, however,
were more cheering, the Doctor had roused himself, and was busy
another work for the press, destined to annihilate Mr.
all other such wicked astronomers.

To that Progress we have not the slightest objection.

And sets a Republic up, or, a worse thing,

We've lost in France, Austria, Italy, Spain,

An heretical Church in our England still stands,
The law still a heretic Sovereign demands.
Therefore Progress abroad is, from Progress at home,
As far as asunder are London and Rome.

That what's fair for ourselves is for others as fair,
That whate'er we demand we must also concede.
That as we are free others may claim to be freed.

To which, from the Pope, all appeal is high treason.

COBBLER'S PUNCH.
This is a liquor composed of gin and cider. It is one in which

At the tremendous Red Republican Demonstration in Hyde Park,
the Chair, on one of the platforms formed of a costermonger's bar-
row, was, according to a reporter, occupied by "a person named
J. Murray, a shoemaker;" and:—
"The Chairman opened the meeting at the costermonger's barrow plat-
form by declaring that this was one of the most important gatherings ever
held in this park, for it was a demonstration in aid of the emancipation of the
down-trodden in the whole human race."
This statement may perhaps be considered to explain the notorious
and singular circumstance that a very large proportion, if not the
greater part, of extreme Democrats are shoemakers. Mr. Odger,
for instance, is a shoemaker, and if Mr. Osger goes beyond his last,
Mr. Murray, seemingly, goes beyond Mr. Osger. Both of those
gentlemen are operative shoemakers, and both have doubtless had
experience in the repair, as well as in the making, of shoes. They
have been accustomed to contemplate the effects of wear and pres-
sure upon soles, and hence have learned to sympathise with the
down-trodden.

A CONFUTATION OF MURPHY.
Tnn "Anti-Popery" lecturer, Murphy, has received a signal
confutation at Whitehaven from a number of pious Roman Catholic
miners. They effectually silenced him for the time—nearly for ever.
According to a contemporary, three hundred of those faithful fellows,
employed at Clator Moor, marching ten abreast," proceeded to the
Oddfellows' Lodge, and set upon Mubphy as he was issuing from the
ante-room, to enter the lecture-hall. This is how they taught Mr.
Murphy to keep his alleged extracts from their devotional manuals
to himself:—
"Catching sight of him, a number of them rushed upon him, dragged him
down the stairs, and struck and kicked him till he was insensible. In that
condition he was rescued by the police, who pulled him within a door, and
closed it on the rioters. It was a considerable time before animation could
be restored, and Mr. Murphy remained in a critical state all night."
It may, however, be questioned whether an over-zealous laity,
like the miners who thus confuted Murphy, should not, if possible,'
be restrained by their spiritual guides from taking the Syllabus into)
their own hands. Not that the subjoined statement, in continuation
of the above, is not, in so far as it concerns Muefhy alone, most
edifying:—
"A correspondent, who visited him next moming, says that the lecturer
then lay upon a bed, unable to move; his head was swathed in bandages, and
hia face bruised, cut, and swollen. There was a shocking wound across his
left eye, and his body was dreadfully discoloured."
In this country an offender suoh as Mubphy cannot be legally
handed over to the Bocular power for condign punishment. Mubphy,
therefore, met with it at the hands of the miners who constituted
the power of a secular Judge Lynch. They executed judgment
upon the heretic by an Act of Faith as complete as circumstances
and the Police allowed.
The religious zeal evinced by the Roman Catholic miners of Clator
Moor in their chastisement of Mubphy, inflicted on him mainly for
his abuse of their revered Priesthood, is remarkable considered in
contrast with the contemptuous indifference whioh miners, as a
body, too commonly exhibit towards Anglican Curates and Clergy-
men in general. There appears to be a held among them for certain
Missionary enterprise.
NEAPOLITAN INTELLIGENCE.
Writing from Naples, a newspaper correspondent states that
Vesuvius. "offers unusual attractions." "It remains," he proceeds
to say, precisely as it was, sending up two columns of ashes and
smoke." But these are the usual attractions of Vesuvius, one would
think; especially since Vesuvius remains precisely as it was. A pos-
sible misprint, however, need not be set down for a bull. In send-
ing up only two columns of ashes and smoke, Vesuvius is very
much more reasonable than a good many of our contemporaries have
shown themselves during the late War.
Rapid Travelling.
The science of aerostation is farther advanced than is commonly
supposed; but at present, the expenses attending this mode of
transit are so great, as to make it available only for Royal per-
sonages. This will explain the announcement that "The Duke of
Genoa is paying flying visits to the most interesting English towns
previous to bis return to Italy."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

I onday, April 24. Said not Mr. Punch exultingly, that
Fighting was at Hand, hooray?
[But first look at the above cut. Live there many who
remember Gilbay and William Pitt f We hope so.]
The Budget is Down! Matches, Successions, Percentage,
all are swept away. Truly, the week was stormy, and our dear merry
friend, Robert Lowe, whom we hereby raise to the Peerage as Lord Mara-
thon de Matchbox, has been the Petrel, and has been hoist with his own
Petard. Excuse a slight confusion of imagery, Addison himself could not,
as you know, write a despatch at a time of excitement.
The kettle began it not—but the things that set the kettle boiling
began it. On this filonday a large army, composed of the persons who are
unfortunate enough to be engaged in the poorly paid match-making trade,
and who apprehended being made yet more unfortunate by Mb. Lowe's
taxation, set forth from the East-eud of London, and proceeded towards
Westminster to present their petition against the new imposition. The
Latin motto on the stamp, though neat, had not charm enough to induce
them to smile at the thought of probable starvation. The Home Secbetaby
sent them word that they really must not come to the House of Commons,
but they persevered. Tney were valorously resisted by the Polioe. Why
should they not be resisted? They were only men, women, and children
coming to ask that they might not be hindered from earning a miserable
livelihood. Had they been Roughs going to break Park Railings, or Repub-
licans crawling to infest Sir E. Landseer's Lions, applaud the French Com-
mune, and insult the Queen, of course it would have been tyrannical to
interfere with them, but, being what they were, it was fit that they should
be taught not to disturb the peace of the streets. The Police did their best,
but hunger would have its way, and in the end a large number of women
and girls actually penetrated into Westminster Hall, and set up " a shrill
shout" when they found that their petition was safe, and had not been
destroyed. Finally, they were turned out of the Hall of the Red King.
But their demonstration had been made.
That same evening Mb. WHrrEt of Brighton, brought on his resolution,
condemning the additional taxation proposed by the Budget. Now, he
would not have had much of a following but for the Conservatives. They,
however, were able to vote with the Brighton Radical, because they are
mostly opposed to the abolition of Army Purchase, and it iB the amount
wanted for "taking the Army out of Pawn" that necessitates the new
taxation. There was a spirited debate, and the wrongs of the Match-people
were not forgotten. Mb. Lowe, Mb. Disraeli, Mb. Gladstone, all mingled
in the fray, and the leader of Opposition, seeing his way to something like
victory, made things very sweet, by suggesting that no Minister would be so
silly as to propose a sham resignation merely because the House differed with
him on a finance question. Mr. Gladstone, that night, did not see
things in the same light, and stood up, strongly, for most of the Budget, but
mildly for the Match-tax. On division the Tories and the Radicals coalesced,
and in a House of 487, Government got 257, which gave them a majority oi
27 only. Loud and long was the cheering on both sides, as when during the
above mentioned Mr. Addison's Cato, the Whigs applauded
every bit in favour of liberty, and the Tories echoed the
plaudit to show that the satire was unfelt. But 27 for the
Budget of a Ministry that revels in "overwhelming major-
ities, meant that the situation must be re-considered.
Tuesday. Mr. Lowe had re-considered it to the extent of
perceiving that, at all events, the Match-tax must go. So
he surrendered it, and promised to let us know on Thursday
what substitute he could find. That night there was as
much rejoicing among the poor hearts in the East as they
are capable of manifesting. There may not have been so
much in the gilded saloons of Downing Street, if they are
so adorned—Punch never goes there; but are not all priests
bloated, all aristocrats haughty, and all saloons gilded?
If not, the inferior press must be sadly misinformed.
Mb. Disraeli, desirous to chain Victory to his brougham-
wheels, gave a hostile notice for Thursday, and the Whip
sent circulars calling on the Liberals to be in their places.
Wednesday there was a lull. Mr. TnoMAS Hughes's
Sunday Trading Bill was discussed, and described as calcu-
lated to press harshly upon a large class who are compelled
to buy and sell on the Sunday. Had it been a Bill with
better chances, the events of the week would have mate-
rially damaged tbom. As it was, the Bill was thrown out
by 80 to 47.
A Bill for creating Public Prosecutors was at last read a
Second Time. Certain lawyers stood up and opposed it, but
the feeling of the heads of their profession is, strongly in its
favour. The majority was 129 to 89. Mr. Bbuce wants to
look after the measure, but he has at least enough to do,
and Mb. Russell Gurney will do weU to mind his own
business, which nobody can mind more wisely. But
Thursday was tho night of the Great Event. The House
was crammed. After some questions, and a declaration by
Mr. Bruce that tho Police had acted with much forbearance
on Monday,
Mb. Gladstone delivered a somewhat long speech on the
Budget. This it had been necessary to re-consider as a
whole. The Government stood by their Estimates, would
not tax articles of great consumption, would not borrow
money. But the proposals as to the Succession Duties would
be abandoned, and so would the proposal to change the
mode of levying the Income-tax from poundage to per-
centage.
But how is the money to be obtained?
Need you ask?
The Income-tax?
Of course. What else? The extra Twopence is to be
laid on, and henceforth the real Working Men are to pay
Sixpence in the Pound.
We bear it, and therefore we deserve to bear it. Let us
do so, and grin with what contortions we may.
The debate was very amusing. Me. Disbaeli, of course,
had no need to make his hostile motion, but he remarked
that this year direct taxation had been increased by Three
Millions. The Budget he described as now one of Sweet
Simplicity. Mb. Lowe (it was rumoured that he had added
his own resignation to the other resignations, but he can't
he spared) spoke smartly. Loed Geobge Cavendish recalled
SHAFTESBTmY's adage that in every man there was a wise
and a foolish person, and now that Mb. Lowe's fool had
had his fling, it was to be hoped the sage would get his in-
nings. Mb. Fawcett made a very sensible speech against
the paying everything by the Income-tax, to which the lower
class was not liable, and therefore that class was encouraged
in its extravagant ideas: a bold and honest word from a
Democrat. Mr. Osborne was witty, and was answered by
Mb. Auberon Herbert with much less good manners than
might have been expected in an Aristocrat. Mr. Brooks
made outspoken and honourable protest against perpetual
recurrence to the Income-tax, and also against its cruelty
to Professional Men. Mr. Beooks spoke excellently, and
from knowledge of what he was talking about, he having
been an Income-tax Commissioner. We take off our hat to
Mr. Brooks. Further discussion was postponed until the
following Monday.
A Pensive Public now understands the great situation of
the week, and is at liberty to regard it in any light that
may please His Pcnsiveness. Mr. Punch will merely assist
meditation by observing that it is a very good thing that the
tax is not to be laid on the poor Match-makers, and also
that it is a very good thing that the Succession Duties are
not to be increased, which would have tended further to
cripple those who, by the death of the head of the family
are deprived of a great part of their income. It would have

179
been bad indeed that the Life Assurance money, perhaps their only-
provision, should have been pillaged. But it is not a good thing
that the Income-tax should be raised to Sixpence; and if we look
at this course merely from an resthetio point of view, we are struck
with the utter absence of inventive genius in the Cabinet. Mr.
Punch could have shown Mb. Lowe a dozen better ways of raising
the money.
Friday. Disorganisation went on with its work. Lord Palmf.r-
ston's step-son, Mr. Cowper Temple, gave the Ministers a most
tremendous beating. And, moreover, he was in the right, and they
were in the wrong. He demanded the preservation of Epping
Forest, which is in a fair, or rather a foul way to ruin. Both Jl k.
Lowe and the Premier put forth their strength against him, but
the House backed him up, and Government were beaten by the
huge majority of 197 to 96—a salute of 101 guns in honour of the
Forest. If Members would only go and look at it (as Mr. Punch
did the other day), they would be ashamed to reflect that they had
left it in danger so long. Censure of the Martini-Henry rifle was
attempted, but it was stamped out by common-sense, evidence, and
a majority of 137 to 72.
The Lords' Week has not been interesting, but a good Bill has
been brought in for getting rid of the soandal of Bankrupt Peers.
An Anti-Westmeath Outrage Bill has also been brought in, but
it has not been expounded. Everything Irish must be done in
some inverted fashion—we wonder that the Minister did not begin
by getting the Royal Assent, and then hark back.
THE OFFICIAL CUT-ME-DOWNS.
Are there not certain fox-hunting districts called, among the men
of Nimrod, "cut-me-down?" At all events that epithet is appli-
cable to some departments of the Public Service which the Govern-
ment has subjected to a very close-shaving economy. One of these
is the Post Office, about which the Standard's very able Dublin
correspondent thus writes:—
"If the public only knew the miserable salaries paid to the rural post-
masters and mistresses in Ireland, they would have far less confidence in the
Post Office than they have at present and be more chary of entrusting
valuables or money orders to its custody."
People, even the scrupulous Irish, are apt, no less than cats and
dogs, to steal rather than starve. Accordingly :—
"At Galway, yesterday, a woman named Krso, late post-mistress at Round-
stone, was convicted on her own confession of having opened a letter contain-
ing a post-bill for £44, forged the name of the person in whose favour it was
drawn, and obtained the money, of which when detected she returned £32.
She was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, which of course she
deserved; but as it was proved on the trial that her salary for the discharge
of arduous and responsible duties was only £7 per annum, out of which she had
to pay £1 10*. to a guarantee society, it may be fairly questioned whether the
greater share of culpability does not rest with the heads of the postal adminis-
tration who expose ill-paid officials to such great temptations.'
Now, the Government naturally cut down all the salaries of their
subordinates they can without any worse result than that of
beggaring or of starving those subordinates. Of course, because
economy wins popularity, and popularity insures office.
Dockyard labourers may say they must live. Ministers do not see
the necessity of that, unless the men are to remain dockyard
labourers. But if so, then the necessity must be evident, even to
Ministers; and so in the case of post-masters, post-mistresses, and
letter-carriers. For dead men and women sort no letters, neither do
they deliver any.
The halfpenny postage of cards and newspapers is a great boon to
the British Public, and also the Irish. All the postal reductions are
great boons. Whilst it makes a vast difference to everybody in easy
circumstances whether he pays a halfpenny or a penny postage, it
would, we all feel, signify nothing to him if lie knew the saving had
been effected, through cutting down the wages of inferior Post-office
people to any degree above starving-point, so long as famine did
not drive those people to break open letters, and steal. But then,
unfortunately, it does. We, the Public, therefore, have to consider
whether or no we had rather continue to insist on the cheapest pos-
sible postage at the risk of occasioning an individual now and then
to be plundered for the advantage of the community, or consent to
let the Government pay the underpaid of the Post Office sufficient
wages to place them above the temptation to steal. Of course,
the cheapest possible postage must be the sole object with all of us
who need not fear being robbed of Post Office orders; but the rest,
who do, should unite in assuring the Government that its members
will really not endanger their own places and pay by raising the
estimates to an amount sufficient for such payment of Post officials
at least, as shall enable them to subsist without theft.
Besides, there is this to be considered, that not even a letter-carrier
can now be hanged for letter-breaking, and that he must, if con-
~\; which costs money.

TESTS OF TENSION.
{Nut to say Tightness.)
S for this Licensing Bill,
Mr. Punch, of Home-
Secretary Bhtjce, impos-
ing heavy penalties on
drunkenness in person, and
on publicans for serving
customers already drunk.
Very proper; but, Sir,
ought there not to be laid
down by enactment some
definition of what consti-
tutes drunkenness? Is a
man, for instance, to be
deemed drunk, and liable
to a fine of twenty shil-
lings, as soon as his
1' tongue begins to double ?''
What would you say to a
clause in Mr. Bruce s Bill
to this effect P—"Be it
enacted, and it is hereby
enacted, that any person
whosoever shall be held,
and considered to be'
Drunk, who, not labour-
ing under any natural
impediment of Speoch, or
temporary loss, or impair-
ment thereof otherwise
than from drinking wine, beer, or spirituous liquors, shall be unable,
when summoned by lawful Authority, distinctly to say 'British
Constitution'." It would be hard to be pronounced drunk for de-
fective pronunciation very possibly owing only to muscular and
nervous disturbance caused by a small quantity of bad liquor.
The same remark is applicable to inability to walk straight. In
some rural districts a elbwn is often met going home zigzag, in con-
sequence of having swallowed a pint only of beershop beer.
How many fingers do I hold up?" is a question which might be
suggested as a test of intoxication or sobriety. As such you can
only judge of it subjectively. Personal reminiscence enables me to
assure you that a man may see double, because he has dined, and
yet be in a state of complete mental sobriety. 1 had, myself, some
years ago, dined, and after dinner found myself in a theatre. Each
one of the performers I saw aB two. Thereupon I began to think
why this was; why, observe, not whence, for I knew that well
enough, knowing that I had dined. To examine that question by
experiment I shut first one eye then the other, and found that,
looking at an object with one eye at a time, I saw it single, saw it
double only with both eyes open. Hence I inferred that the cause
which occasions objeots to be seen double after dining (as I had
dined) probably was simply a derangement of the nerves and muscles
of the eye-balls; the muscles of either eye-ball contracting not in
conjunction but unequally, so as to pull the eyes out of concert, and
make a person look at things, and see them, with each eye by itself
instead of with both eyes at once. Push one eye out of relation to the
other with your finger, and you will immediately see double with-
out having dined. Duplicity of vision would, surely, be no criterion
of criminal drunkenness, even if it could be detected by a detective,
still less in case, merely, that a common policeman swore to it. Did
it not in my own person coexist with a philosophy worthy of
Socrates at a Symposium, when he had seen all his disciples under
the table P However, I do not mean to compare myself with Socrates,
except as to features perhaps, and figure, in which particulars I
have the honour to resemble that Sage, and am also qualified to say
that I am yours truly, Sn.ENTja.
P.S. When, late of an evening after dinner, men begin to talk
theology, is that evidence of the state whose prevention is intended
by the Licensing Bill P I fear you will say, yes.
A Painful Thought.
It is said to have been expected that the Irish would have joined
in the Red Republican procession to Hyde Park. There is reason to
rejoice that they did no such thing. The procession was intended to
demonstrate sympathy with gentlemen of the pavement who mal-
treat and imprison French priests, an Archbishop even, pull the
Cross down, and set up the Red Flajj in its place. The Irish would
have mingled with it only with a view to upset it, and probably
given the sympathisers with rioters whom they detest, a severe
beating, which would have been painful, at least to Red Republicans,
who, when next they announce a demonstration, had better, perhaps,
mention that no Irish need attend.

CHECK TO KING MOB.
There are to be no more seditious demonstrations in Trafalgar
Square and Hyde Park. No longer will dissatisfied, still less will
disaffected Leaguers and Unionists be suffered to parade London in
procession. A strong Government has shaken off its lethargy at
last, and is showing itself as it were a roused Lion, lashing his tail.
On Monday last week, the riotous match-makers, "principally,"
says the Times, "working girls and working boys, a year or two in
their teens," marching in the Bow Road, were encountered by a line
of Police, abreast. Having dodged the Police, and marched on to
"Westminster, these juvenile malecontents, fain to intimidate the
Legislature, were swept by the Guardians of Order in that district
clean out of "Westminster Hall.
Clean, that is, completely. According to the Post, the Police
confronted them with drawn staves; drew cordons against them
also across streets, and acted with a vigour amounting to "no little
brutality." "When they stopped the procession in Bow Road, "they
ordered the bands to cease playing, and seizing a considerable
number of the flags, tore them up. They also seized the petition
which was suspended from a pole, and tore it in pieces." Now, then,
the Clerkenwell Roughs know what they have to expect if they
"come in their thousands," attempting to dictate to a powerful
Government, which will no longer affect to treat their displays of
physical force with contempt since it has shown itself capable of
repressing the miserable match-makers' demonstration. "When next

And the fragrance of the mint-sauce, whose perfume we nose above

Commend me to Asparagus, which should, aright to taste,
Be green well-nigh from end to end, for all the white is waste.
More profit to the gardener than good for the guest, I ween.
An the stalk be some six inches long and the tip thereof only green.
Thereto some molten butter do take—each one to what he list,
As the good man said upon a time his heifer when he kissed.

I had liefer a dash of vinegar with a dressing of salad oil.
Asparagus, thou dost recall full many a day's delight,
When horse-chestnut trees were out in bloom, and hawthorns green

And we roamed the meads, for men walk must needs, fall to an they

Till the board was crowned when thou wentest round, as did also the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MY HEALTH.
UK dinner is going
on well: wine ex-
cellent: table nicely
arranged: room
charming: Gothic
furniture: every-
thing so nice, clean,
and comfortable.
"Now,"saysJos-
lyn, who, it ap-
pears, understands
ordering a dinner,
"I've got for you
a compote of pigeon
coming, which, I
think, you'll like."
We wait. Budd
suggests filling up
the time with the
enormity of a glass
of claret. We do
it. A waiter (quite
new to us) rushes
in with a covered
dish and plates.
Great excitement
on the part of Man
by the Fire. "Ha!
ha' we hear him
exclaim, "At last!" and he begins to flourish a knife and fork.
Waiter smiles, and plumps dish down on table before him, plate
also. Irate Man audibly smacks his lips and draws in his breath as
if in for a good thing. Now then. Waiter whisks off cover. Angry
and hungry man ready to plunge his knife and fork in, pauses,
as if struck electrically, "Why, dash it" (dash is not the word)
"it's Pudding !.'" They've brought him apple-pudding.
"Confound it! Why, I—I—" he can hardly speak, he's so angry.
I haven't had any meat yet. Take it away, and—and—" in a voice
of thunder, "Dash it Will you bring my Veal Cutlet!!"
Mild Man, plaintively in corner, is here heard. He raises his
voice and arrests the waiter's attention, "I'll take the pudding,"
which, as he's only just done his Ash, proves him to be of an accom-
modating disposition.
The waiter is about to comply with his request when another
official rushes in, all hot, blows up the first waiter, takes the pudding
angrily from him, and both vanish in a flash of excitement, before
the Angry Man, now fuming, can take advantage of a new waiter's
appearance to demand his rights in veal cutlets. Enter third waiter
with our Compote of Pigeon. [ Our dinner goes on pleasantly enough;
tee can understand the "waits" which are quite in keeping with
the first night of a new piece (i.e. of The Table d'Hote specially at
this unseasonable time), and we fill up our intervals with the wine,
which Joslyn has craftily ordered beforehand. Compote excellent.
First-rate chef at the Cramville.] On apparition of third waiter,
angry and starving person by fire is at him, "Look here, waiter,
I can't stand this." Waiter replies, en passant, "In one minute,
Sir, I '11 attend to you," which causes him to rise from table, take
his hat, hesitate, put it down again irritably, reseat himself, and
then he finds Waiter Number Three opposite him, asking placidly,
"Have you ordered anything. Sir?" Ihis sends him up again; he
nearly kicks over the table. Ordered!" he exclaims, then restrain-
ing himself by a great effort for a second, he bangs his fist on the
table, and in a tone of what the opera librettists call "suppressed
fury,*' exclaims, "Where's My VEAL CUTLET I"
The waiter is perfectly calm, and indeed sympathetic—but con-
foundedly irritating (we agree to that) when he asks, in a tone of
interest, Haven't you had it, Sir t"
This is too much for the Man by the Fire. "Had it!!" he shouts.
"Why, I've been waiting here—I've only had soup—they brought
me pudding—and—and—here, DASH it, send the Manager." He
is so savage under much provocation that he orders the Manager as
if he were a dish, and he intended dining off him instead of veal
cutlets.
The mild voice from the corner here addresses the waiter. "If I
can't get anything else, I'll take some sugar." Poor man! Sugar
is hardly a substitute, even to the happiest disposition, for three
courses, entries, rati, and dessert. Will he, the Mild Man in the
Corner, take some cold beef? Certainly ; whatever he can get; and
he has it. Not so the Man by the Fire, who will have the Manager,
and nothing but the Manager. He refuses such blandishments
(chiefly offered by the pacificating Irish waiter) as "Would ye take
some cold beef, Sorr, and " (as an additional inducement) " piokles?"
He dashes pickles. No, where's the Manager ?" He's comin', Sorr
—but won't ye take some—some cold ham, or "—vaguely—" a out
off the joint, with"—another inducement—"potatoes?" The in-
dignant visitor by the fire won't have anything or anybody except
the Manager.
Enter a respectable man, respectful and attentive. The waiters
remain to listen. "Who's that P" Budd is ready—" Meres, the
Manager." Mb. Merks has a talent evidently for taming violent
guests, like Rarey's with obstreperous horses. He bows, he is
grave, he is deeply interested; he attempts no explanation except
the true one, of their being, he regrets to say, unprepared for such
a sudden influx of business, and is positive that nothing of the sort
shall occur again.
"It is," he adds, "most unfortunate," and while ho is yet talk-
ing, a new waiter, entering quietly, artfully places before the almost
cxnausted stranger a dish of veal outlets, .some asparagus, and a pint
bottle of claret. His complaints subside into an explanation (almost
apologetic) about his having had a long walk, and being peculiarly
hungry, and so he is gradually soothed, and his equilibrium restored.
As to what becomes of the unfortunate gentleman in the corner,
who dined off " fish first" and " sugar to follow," he has disappeared
during the above conversation, having perhaps retaliated upon the
Hotel for his treatment, by taking this opportunity for executing
the practical joke of leaving without paying his bill.
We adjourn to the billiard-room, where we smoke and take coffee.
The Cramville is, certainly, as a hotel, unique. A Gothic hotel.
Gothic furniture, with variations. The billiard-room, a cheerful
room of a sort of Japanese Gothic; as if the Mikado (or whatever the
dignitary is) had suddenly exhibited High Church tendencies, but,
being only half converted, had ended in building a billiard-room.
All very charming and pleasant; and so we sit and take our coffee,
and look at the billiard-table. I look at my watch to see about
returning to my Aunt.
Thoughts on this Subject.—If she's up, I shan't want to see her.
Should frighten her, perhaps. If she's in bed I can't 6ee her (and
she'd frighten me, perhaps). If they're all gone to bed I needn't
ring, as one of the peculiarities, of Ramsgate is, from what I have
noticed, open house all day and night. Confiding, but foolish. Useful,
however, on occasion, but not now.
Budd is "walking my way," he says, "so if I Btop just for one
game of billiards, we '11 go together." By all means. He at pre-
sent proposes committing the enormity of "B & S's.," adding that
"he s quite given up this sort of thing at night. Never mind:
Turkish Bath to-morrow." Billiards.
LIBERTY AND LICENCE.
Toe Licensing System is pushed a long way.
On how many things there's a Licence to pay!
Imposed on Armorial Bearings we've one;
A Dog-licence too, and the like on a Gun.
The Licence on Dogs, that guard house and kill rats,
May followed be, soon, bv a Licence on Cats.
A Licence for sale need Wine, Spirits, and Beer.
A yet more strict Licence the Publicans fear.
By Liberal Rulers so governed are we,
That year after year we get less and less free;
And feel, though we try hard the feeling to smother,
That Liberty's one thing, and Licence another.
WISDOM UPON WHEELS.
Wh atever Educationists may say upon the matter, there is little
doubt, we fancy, that there is a growing taste for literature among
our humbler classes. Look at the crowd daily gathered round the
Punch window! See the clusters studying the placards of the
newspapers! Why, you hardly find a cabman without hiB penny
journal to amuse him as he sits upon his stand in waiting for a fare.
Considering the time that cabmen have upon their hands, it would
be an act of charity to found for them a pleasant circulating library.
Novels might be written for their express amusement, and suited to
the rank they occupy in life; that is to say, the cab-rank. As a
beginning, we observe one which we think appropriate. This novel
is entitled, A Cast for a Crown: and it might be not inaptly suc-
ceeded by a sequel, which might bear the title of A Set Down for a
Shilling.
Ancestral Osteology.
A correspondent of the Times, referring to the use, by authority,
"of churchyard mould, bones, and fragments of coffins, as a new
road material," speaks of those materials as " strange substitutes for
Macadam." Mb. Darwin would perhaps suggest that, as far as the
bones are concerned, that species of M'Adam should be called
M'Ape.

MATRIMONIAL INTELLIGENCE.
Directly after Easter the fashionable newspapers are full of
fashionable details about fashionable marriages. The matrimonial
alliances which have been upon the tapis for several weeks past are,
as soon as Lent is over, brought to the solemnity of the nuptial cere-
mony. Hence, we see long columns full of elegant description of
the dresses of the bridesmaids and the trousseau of the bride, and
the wedding-gifts presented by her noble friends and kinsfolk.
Such histories, no doubt, are most delightful reading; but, after
the first score or so, there is certainly about them a slight flavour of
monotony. Even the long list of titled wedding-guests is apt to
pall upon the palate, and one reads with some fatigue, not unmixed,
perhaps, with envy, the catalogue of bracelets and other costly
articles which they have "donated," as our Yankee friends would
say, to the causes of their coming. Interesting as it may be to read
a glowing record of the nuptials of the great, the philosophic mind
might find, by way of contrast, some pleasure in a chronicle of
humbler happy couplings. Variety is charming; and, just by way
of change from the fashionable ceremonies which are just now so
much solemnised, it might be a relief to skim over the details of a
record of the wedding of Miss Jones with Ms. Beown, or of Miss
Robinson with Mb.. Smith. Indeed, descending even lower in the
social scale, we rather fancy a philosopher would turn with some
alacrity from an elegant description of a fashionable marriage to a
simple and straightforward account of the proceedings at the wedding
of a chimney-sweep.
We are most of us acquainted with the social forms and cere-
monies of a marriage in high life, but an accurate description of a
marriage in low life would De novel and instructive. We should be
doubtless entertained, as well as much enlightened, if some adven-
turous ohronicler would describe a nuptial ceremony performed, say,
in Whiteohapel, and tell us how the fair bride was attired on the
occasion, and what wedding gifts were given her, and what articles
of finery were comprised inner trousseau. We should be also deeply
interested to hear whether the bridegroom wore a tulip, or a dahlia,
or a sunflower in his button-hole, and if he had his shoes blacked on
arriving at the church. We should vastly like to know, too, what
delicacies of the season, including shrimps and periwinkles, were
provided for the breakfast, and what amount of beer was imbibed
on the occasion of drinking the bride's health. We should likewise
be rejoiced to read a word-for-word report of the speeches that were
made (omitting expletives esteemed too strong for publication); and
we should be greatly interested to know whether the bridegroom,
supposing him a C'ostermonger, gave his moke a feed of corn before
starting in his carriage, with his lovely bride beside him, in a shower
of satin slippers, upon his wedding trip.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RHYME WITHOUT REASON.
"Sirmnsit Fbtends," one of Claribel's latest songs,
is advertised with an illustrative stanza (on the same
principle as the man who had a house to let carried about
a brick as a specimen) thus:—
Where are thy Rummer friends,
Friends of thy youth?
Gone with the summer birds,
Back to the South.
This leaves it uncertain whether, in order to rhyme,
"youth" should be sung "yoicM," or "south" "suth."
We shall be told, of course, that the rhyme is addressed
to the eye, not to the ear. By such a canon the following
lines may possibly be deemed melodious :—
Peasant Arcadian,
Guiding the plough;
Coarse are your garments,
Your aspect is rough.
Peasant imprudent,
I hear you've a cough;
Do you feel sure
You 're clad warmly enough?
Bibulous peasant,
Your voice it is rough;
You 're no disciple
Of temperate Gofoh.
Home to your cottage,
You hear the wind a sough.
Even the birdies,
Sing hoarse on the bough.
Home to your cottage,
And bend o'er the trough,
Kneading in loaves
The digestible dongh.
Though the bread's heavy,
Unyielding and tough;
Chawbacon's teeth.
Will get easily through.
Mr. Punch commends these stanzas to any French
ladies or gentlemen at present resident in England, who
may be desirous of mastering the peculiarities of English
pronunciation.

NOBLE SACRIFICES TO PRINCIPLE.
A happy thought, suggested to the United Kingdom Alliance, and
all other persons desirous of suppressing or restricting the Liquor
Trade, will doubtless be hailed with acclamation by those philan-
thropists, and they will immediately proceed to carry it out. That
is to say, they will forthwith institute a subscription amongst them-
selves, with suoh aid as others may be disposed to render them, in
order to indemnify Publicans for the injury or ruin of their trade by
legislation. An addition to the felioity of this idea is furnished by
the further proposal that they should make pecuniary arrangements
for supplying, out of their own resources, the deficiency which,
if they succeed in preventing the consumption of generous, not to
say intoxicating liquors, they must create in the revenue. No doubt
they will eagerly adopt this too, and so preclude the necessity of an
increased Income-tax to defray the cost of their triumphant
agitation.
UNIVERSITY AND CANINE.
Aw Oxford Statute, "concerning the Delegates of University
Police," amended in a "Congregation" the other day, provides
that :—
"Each Proctor shall, if he think fit, appoint one person or more to attend
upon him; and the sum of £30 per annum out of the fund hereinafter men-
tioned shall be placed at the disposal of each Proctor for the payment of such
attendance."

ST. PAUL'S SERMON FROM ST. PATRICK'S TEXT.
Oh, London is a big place, and Dublin is a little one,
And St. Paul's on fame has a fast hold, where St. Patrick's has a
brittle one.
And if Dublin could boast a big brewer of stout in the late SrR
Benjamin Guinness,
Our Barclay and Perkins is to him as a first-rate to a pinnace.
But Sir Benjamin Guinness he put down his thousand a hundred
and thirty,
To cleanse and restore St. Patrick's, dilapidated and dirty,
And now here's Sir Henry Roe, another stout Dublin citizen,
Of Cathedral restoration an equally hot fit is in.
And all to the honour of his high-prized, but no longer, alas, high-
priced Church,
Undertakes to raise from its ruins Dublin's sister-cathedral Christ-
Church.
And, eke, for the ousted Establishment that he was born and bred in,
To build a handsome Synod-House, to lay its evicted old head in.
Ah me. when will London's citizen-roll show us its Roe anil its
Guinness,
For all so big as is London's talk, and abundant as London tin is!
Where will she find, 'mong the city-mice who to fatness have fed
on her fat ricks
One to do for St. Paul's, what Guinness and Roe have for Christ-
church done and St. Patrick's Y
Come enter my gates, you money-grubs, from your courts, and
alleys, and slums busy,
And look upon me, to your shame—" «(' opprobrium querras—cir-
eumspice."'
Here I Btand, Wren's masterpiece, in your midst, all naked and
unfinished,
With my noble interior blank and bare, and my fair proportions
'minished,
For want of tho colour to warm me, and the gold for their defining.
And starve in the cold, while at my feet you are in your Guildhall
dining:
Rich enough among the lot of you with sovereigns to tile my
dome in,
Nor feel a penny the poorer each civic millionnaire's home in,
Yet Dublin can find two citizens; when London in vain may seek
one,
To do more for her two poor churches, than you for ycui
unique one
qui
So no wonder disgust has waked to speech the tongue in my bricks
and mortar.
And that St. Paul's face blushes to look, at St. Patrick's
the water!
CAUTION TO CLERGYMEN.
On Monday afternoon, last week, tho first of a series of lectures
"designed to counteract the progress of unbelief among the educated
classes of society," was given in St. George's Hall, Langham Place,
by the Archbishop of York. It was specially directed against the
theory of Development of Species, and appears, by a report of it, to
have consisted mainly of general observations, which had been made
before. Towards the achievement of the desirable end which is that
of these lectures, here is the contribution of a little doggerel:—
Would you win Latitude?
. Will you by Platitude?
To which may be added the suggestion, that your discourse should
never be as long as it is usually wide.
"Ex Luce Lucellum."
TO WASTE-PAPER DEALERS.— To be Disposed of: An immense
quantity of unmatched Classical Literature, the writer having uo lurlher
use for it, and the authorities of the House compelling immediate clearance.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Onday, May 1, began
a Parliamentary week
of some excitement
and some amusement.
May is held to set the
pulses dancing, and
t here is no reason why
the political pulse
should not enjoy its
dance with the best.
In the House of Com-
mons
Stop! This day was
opened the London
International Exhi-
bition at Kensington.
This day twenty years
ago was opened the
grand old Snow which
we shall all remember
while memory holds
her seat in this Dis-
traotcd Orb (points to
head), albeit the out-
side of the said orb
has been unthatched
for some, and whitened
for others, since that
remarkable May-day
of 1851. The last
ceremonial was not
much like the first,
but we had a fine day,
and everything would
have gone off delight-
fully but for the stu-
pidity of the police
arrangements. These angered us at the time, but we are pacified
now, and smile at the recollection of the fiery furnace of a gallery
in which Mr. Punch and all the Diplomatists were roasted in a vain
endeavour to get out. He congratulates the Heir-Apparent, and
all concerned, upon the success of the day. Where the Exhibition
is. and what is in it, Mr. Punch hopes to learn at some future time.
The police kept the secret very well this Monday.
In the House of Commons there was a great fight. Mh. W. H.
Smith, M.P. for Westminster, brought on a resolution against
Mb. B. Lo-Lo's Budget. He spoke excellently. So did several, on
both sides, out of the many who let themselves off:
"Deep in the ring Bon Lowe engaged,
And, fierce, Disraeli's broadsword raged."
Your Barinc;, your Henley, your Lr/wiocx, your Stansfeld, your
Harcourt, were among the _ combatants. Your—he shall be our
0. Morgan spoke, and happily referred to a famous contribution
made by Mb. Pepys, as part of His Diary, to this journal some years
back,_ wherein it was shown that men are often very liberal when
ordering dinner, much less so when the bill comes in—the House
readily voted armaments, but grudged taxation. There is a brilliant
future before Mb. Morgan, if he continue* to study the Great
Authority on Everything. Mb. Gladstone spoke with aoenstomed
vigour. Shall we re-produce anybody's argument? Perish the
thought! The division was the argument, and the Government
obtained a majority of 85, 335 to 250. If it be that there are only
378 " available" Liberals, and there were 14 pairs, the party stood
loyally by its chiefs.
The Lords forwarded the Trades Unions Bills—and could get no
information as to an alleged proclamation by the Chinese Govern-
ment to the effect that they mean to repress the practices of the
agents of the Missionary Unions.
Tuesday. In that same august House, the Bill for dealing
with the Westmeath Ring of Assassins was explained. It gives
considerable powers, and if acted upon with rapidity and vigour,
the Westmeath King will speedily be between four walls, and the
vicious circle will thus be squared. The Lord Lieutenant seems to
have ample authority to arrest anybody who is in Westmeath,
or is suspected of having been there within a given time. Now, as
every member of the Assassins' Association is stated to be known at
the Castle, the moment the Bill passes—wc suppose it would bo too
dreadfully irregular to deal a moment sooner with those whom
Lobd Saxisbuby very properly called Thugs—there should be a
wholesale_razzifl. He declared his belief that ordinary law, suited
to law-abiding people, ought not to be tried on barbarous people,
and he would give Loud Sandhurst power to stamp out murder in
Ireland as Thuggee was stamped out in India. But, as Lady
Blarney (an Irish lady?) says,
Madam, there is a form."
"there is a form in these things,
Several topics came up in the Commons, and notices of hostility to
the Bill for dealing with our fat friend Bung were given. He is
shouting out mightily, and there is a memorial against the measure
at every public-house, so an industrious tippler can sign a great
many petitions in the course of his day's walking abroad and reeling
home. Mb. Whalley finished the evening by a row with the
Speaker—anything to put oneself en incidence. On another night
the same Honourable Member moved for aU the correspondence about
Murphy, the lecturer, but did not persist in the demand after the
House had been tola that the result would be a ponderous and
monstrous Blue-Book. Surely the matter may be left to the law,
which Mr. Punch hopes will be hard upon the ruffians who kicked
Murphy, whose punishment for coarse assaults on other people's
faith should have been punished only by moral kicking, such as is
administered by Mr. Punch.
Wednesday. This was the Great Day of Fun. This will bo known
as Woman's Wednesday. One whose voioe reminded Mr. Glad-
stone of that of a friend and colleague, the voice was the voice of
Jacob—Bbiqbt, brought on his Bill for giving Women votes at
Parliamentary elections. As every Lady worthy of the beautiful
name reads every word of Mr. Punch's, he need not particularly
invite feminine attention to the following excerpts (selections, dears)
from the very amusing debate :—
Mr. Bbioht hoped that the Government would leave this an open
question.
Mb. Gladstone said " Hear, hear 1" which meant open.
Mb. Eastwick supported. Women are not so turbulent and
revolutionary as men, and all their reforms would be of the mildest
character.
Mk. I iouvEBiE resisted change. Women ought not to be forced
into the mud of politics. Educated women did not seek the
franchise, and surely we did not want to give it to the lower class
of women. As for woman needing protection, her true protection
was in the fact that there was not a man of forty who did not
identify his happiness and his interests with one woman, "or with
more than ono woman" {laughter). Mind, this was a very sharp and
telling speech, but Mb. Bouvebie ought not to have called Mr.
Mill a crude sophist.
> Mr. Scourfield could not see why the wish of the vast majority
of women to be let alone and live quietly should be set at nought
for the sake of a small set of demonstrative talkers. Some of them
he half believed to be men in women's clothes. He thought the
House should demand the photographs of the women who wanted
this Bill.
Mr. Gladstone remarked that the Bill avoided any statement of
reasons for the change it proposed. He saw the greatest objection
to the attendance of women at elections. Then, why were Married
Women to be disqualified? He was ready to discuss the question
whether women might not vote by deputy. There was no grievance
on the part of the upper ten thousand," but there was an increase
in the number of self-dependent women in the lower olasses, and
perhaps they obtained less than justice from English law. He
thought that we struck a serious blow at the law of Marriage when
we passed the Divorce Act. He could not support this Bill, but was
glad that the activity of thought was directing itself to tho adjust-
ment of the relations between Man and Woman.
Lobd John Mannebs supported the Bill. Women ought to have
been able to express their feelings on that very Divorce Act which
concerned them so much.
Mb. Beresford Hope opposed the Bill. He had a high respect
for the women of this country, but thought a woman s tongue,
sharpened by debates and journalism, a very formidable weapon.
He would certainly keep women out of the Hurly-Burly of politics.
He gathered from Mr. Gladstone's speech that he would soon be
converted to the Women's Rights side. If single women were en-
franchised you could not exolude married women. We should have
in tho House Emotional and Sentimental, rather than Logical and
Reasoning men. Our legislation would become hysterical and spas-
modical.
Dr. Lyon Playfaib held that real "politics," separate from
party, was the science of governing, and we had no right to shut out
from it half tho population. He disapproved of the definition of
woman's mission as being that of " making lifo endurable." _
Mb. Henry James strongly assailed the Bill. He denied the
capacity of woman for politics. Woman's gift of sympathy made
logic impossible to her. She was utterly blind to error on the side
on which she ranged herself. He ended one of the most effective
and most applauded speeches that have been made for a long time,
by saying that the argument* against the measure would be under-
stood by all who remembered the first words from their first in-
structress, and in maturer years had felt the influence of a puro
woman's love. .
Mb. Ward Hunt supported the Bill. Women wero religious,

Mr. Bright would have liked Mb. James to be answered by some
of the women who were listening to that debate. But as no lady
cried out from the gallery that she was ready, the House divided,
and there

My dears, you, the Darlings of England and of Mr. Punch, I
know that you are all as glad of this decision as possible, whatever
you may pretend, in your delightful sauciness. There!
Thursday. As the Lords could not, constitutionally, worry our
dear old Lo-Lo in his capacity of Chancellor of Exchequer, they
got at him as Master of the Mint, and had a debate about the New
Mint (which is to be on the Thames Embankment) and there were
unkind things said about officials. Lord Lansdowne defended the
establishment, and introduced a gracefully implied compliment to
Db. John Percy " of European reputation," whose pupil the chemist
to the Mint had been.
The Postmaster-Gene rax stated that he had dismissed a valuable
public servant for having divulged part of some telegraph message
about a turf matter. It was exceedingly wrong in an official to
betray"any secret, and as for this one, remember what is said in Le
Due Job, a secret need not be respectable to be respected."
Then did we have another Budget fight. Mr. Torbens, in a
capital speech, proposed that Mb. Lowe should not be allowed to
make the Income-tax more than Five-pence. There were some very
smart things emitted in the debate. Mb. Bernal Osbobne said
that the Income-tax payer ^would answer Me. Lowe as the Needy
Knife-grinder was answered, "I give thee sixpence, I will s<
&c, first." Mb. Cross called the Government Fools! But then he
did so in Greek (N^inoi), which took away aU the rudeness. We
have not had any Greek in the House for a long time. Mb. Cross
has not forgotten Rugby and Trinity. The two great leaders
finished with rather a spirited combat, and Mr. Tobrens had the
satisfaction of leading forth 248, the Government having 294—
majority for the Sixpenny Income-tax, 46. "We'U remember at
Aix"—». e., at the very next general election, Gentlemen of the
Majority.
Friday. We finished a lively week very dully. The Lords talked
about Artillery, and the Commons about Paupers. Yet there was
vice mingled with our dulness, for we read the Income-tax Bill a
Second Time.
ANYTHING TO OBLIGE.
The subjoined announcement in the newspapers has given general
satisfaction:—
"The Purchase op Postage-Stamps.—After the 30th June next the
permission whioh has been hitherto granted to Officers of the Post-Office to
purchase postage-stamps from the public will be withdrawn, and such pur-
chases thenceforward forbidden."
This fresh proof of a constant anxiety to afford the Public every
possible accommodation cannot but add very much to the popularity
of Government. Its kindness reaUy becomes—yes—oppressive.
Bob and Jerry.
Me. Lowe has abandoned the principle of constructing a Budget
so as to make it unpleasant to everybody. He has adopted that of
concentrating its unpleasantness on one class. This is an advance
on the famous rule of Jebemy Bentham. It may be formulated as
the greatest possible unhappiness of the smallest number.

PUNCH'S PROTEST
Against all Woman's Movements towards the House of
Commons.
No—Judy—no—I '11 yield to none in husbandly docility,
fingers in masculine Parliament-Pie.
Common sense the House of Commons as arena for masculine folly
ticks;
Nor have Mollies and Pollies a right therein, because its trade is
polly-ticks:
If they try to get credit in that house, they may run up some jolly
ticks,
But their power to redeem their pledges, spite of Jacob Bright, I
deny.
Of the feminine element, as it is, we've enough, and too much, in
breeches;
From both sides, and below the gangway, too many an old woman
preaches;
The only tongue-fence we want is that which serves to bar out long
speeches—
And that's not the sort of tongue-fence the ladies would supply.
You drive in the small end of the wedge when you ask votes for the
spinster:
Soon her married sister would claim to send her mouth-piece to
Westminster:
Then, if the wife voted one way, and her husband voted against her,
A nice life her lord and master would have, till he ate his humble
pie!
Words to the Wise.—Never give people wine who are not worth
their salt.
QUESTIONS OF CONSCIENCE.
Isn't it hig^h time there should be an end of such announcements
as the foUowing, which appeared the other day in the Times t—■
"Conscience Money.—The Chancellor of thb Exchequer acknow-
ledges the receipt of the second halves of two £60 notes from 'M. D.' on
account of unpaid Income-tax; also of £40 for the public account."
Is it possible that " M. D." means Doctor of Medicine? Can a
physician be capable of encouraging the confiscation of fees?
Whatever "M. D." may be, he might have considered if the per-
verse aggravation of an unjust impost was the occasion whereon to
send the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is termed "con-
science" money for unpaid Income-tax. Anybody who keeps an
enlightened conscience would know better than so to assist in the
spoliation of himself and others. "Nobody ought to be wiser than
the laws." Corollary: No one need be honester than the Govern-
ment.
Suppose " M. D." had lived in Jack Sheppabd's time. Suppose
he had been summoned by that tax-gatherer to stand and deliver.
Suppose he had surrendered all the property he thought he had
about him. Suppose Jack Sheppard nad made off with it. Sup-
pose " M. D." had then discovered a banknote left in his pocket-
book. Would he have sent the halves of it as " conscience money"
to Jonathan Wild?
The Tap and Turf.
Which is the more ruinous vioe, betting or boozing? Whether
is a Racing Stud or a Public-house the more objectionable? If the
Publican's trade is to be diminished because it affords facilities for
drunkenness, why not the Stud-keeper's because it affords facilities
for gambling? If that generous liquor, beer, is liable to abuse, is
not occasion for evil likewise afforded by that noble animal the
horse? Suppose Bung subjected to a repressive Licensing System,
ought not similar restrictions to be imposed on racing Noblemen?

Anybody who wishes to oblige Mr. PuncJi will go to the Duke of Welling-

asked by the exceedingly charming vendor. The fortunate purchaser will
then bring the object, in a Hansom cab, or otherwise, to 85, Fleet Street, and
leave it, and a polite message. Now you may think that this paragraph is
designed to assist an excellent scheme, one for an Hospital at Ventnor. It
may have that effect, but Mr. Punch's chief purpose is to invite attention to
the spread of belief in the Separate or Cottage Principle of Hospital building.
This ne regards as one of the great Sanatory advances of the age, and as he
has preached on the text of isolation, many a time and oft, he is paying a
tribute to his own prescience in recording the success of his teaching. He

again suggests that his admirers should visit the Ducal Bazaar.

Lu-Lu she can spring,
Like a shaft from the string,
Or a stone from a sling,
Five-and-twcnty feet clean;
As, for weeks past, hath been
At the Holborn Cirque seen:
And as posters display
To the people who stay
From the Circus away.
How she does it, none knows:
If by spring from her toes;
Or by springs in her clothes:
Or some artifice neat.

Such as Lambeth essays,

And win pudding, not praise.

But if up Lu-Lu go,
Like arrow from bow,
What's Lu-Lu to Low-Lows?
Who like him, now alive,
Ever jumped, at a drive,—
Four times twenty and five?
That first leap showed more vigour:
And the space cleared was bigger;
Eighty-five was its figure.
But the spring must have slackened:
For, behold, leap the second
Forty-six* only reckoned!
If a third leap be tried,
It Low-Lowe might betide
To fall just the wrong side,
And, in leaping at pelf,

But smash ropes, net, and shelf.
Meanwhile, he's all right;
Still St. Stephen's delight,
For his aerial flight!—
After which, with complete

Think of this leap unmatched,
Without ties, unattached,
Off an old budget,t patched!
That had no spring- or catch-box
Past the size of a patch-box,

Could the force have been hid

Of making Low-Lowe

MY HEALTH.
Billiards.—Budd asks Joslyn if he '11 play a game. JoRMfjr will,
but observes that " he hasn't touched a cue for years." Budd now
tries to remember when it was that he last played a game. He
decides that it was ever so long ago.
Mem. Good plan this; because, lstly, if you play badly, why, it
is evidently because you 're out of practice. 2naly, if you astonish
yourself by making brilliant strokes, it will be clear to your friend
that you used to be a first-rate player, and haven't forgotten your
science. It is arranged that I am to play the winner. I only
remark that it's getting very late. Budd answers carelessly that we
shan't be more than twenty minutes. » • •
Whether it's the dinner of yesterday, or the late hours, or the
change, of the weather, I don t know, but I am not so well this
morning. It's true that Budd said, "Never mind what you do
to-day (yesterday) because to-morrow (that's now to-day) you '11
begin your Turkish Baths;" but still it only shows me that I must
be particular as to what I do. It is evident (if yesterday's doings
were the cause of to-day's indisposition) that among tho things
I cannot do with impunity is a dinner given by Joslyn, billiards,
champagne, sherry, various drinks afterwards, and to bed late.
I write down my symptoms in a diary, so as to be able to refer to
it afterwards when consulting a doctor. An excellent plan, and as
the advertisement saj'Bof the Cocoa (which I mustn't touch) "highly
recommended by the Faculty."
Symptoms of To-day. Diary of Health.—Hot nose. .... I
pause for awhile to think what else! I have got a sort of headache
but not quite a headache. I mean not a headache that makes you
say, "0 do—" I have sot it is true to pull down the blinds—" 0 do go
away No, I don't want anything, thank you—" (" Thank
you being given very politely, and meaning "May the anathemas,"
&c, &c.) If you'd only kindly leave me alone .... and da ask
that dove not to coo .... and please shut up that—that—dog
.... if I could only sleep I might"
No, it's not that sort of thing. Then there's a pain on my eye-
lids, but not a definite pain, so I can't put it down. General lassi-
tude, perhaps, and a feeling of increased fatness, that is, what the
tailors mean when they inform you cheerfully, having shouted out
to the man in the box, "Ninety-six and a half!" they add, cheer-
fully, "A trifle stouter, Sir, I think, than last time;" and you sud-
denly pulling yourself up very upright, expand your chest, and
partially correct his mistake by explaining, "and broader," in order
to show him that the increase below is, after all, only symmetrically
in keeping with extension above. This is what I experience this
morning. After this diagnosis I sum up truthfully in my Diary of
Health. Day of the Month. Time. Hot nose. General tightness.
Weather. N.E. wind. Appetite, nothing remarkable, chiefly an
inclination towards dry toast, and a feeling of disgust for butter.
I do not like this Hot Nose. Suppose it swells. Suppose it gradu-
ally beoomes redder and redder, a consequence of getting hotter and
hotter. I am sure that a hot nose is a sign of debility; Mulfer, my
medical friend, once told me so, and I took to port wine. Port wine,
everybody is aware, produces this sort of nose; therefore the remedy
was, I hope, homosopathic. I don't think it has ever gone entirely
away, but has been stealing gradually upwards like afternoon
shadows on a mountain. Occasions will bring out my Hot Nose
symptom. The colour seems, as it were, to be done in a sort of in-
visible ink in which secret despatches used to be written, and which
only show out after a warming before a fire. Joslys's dinner has
done it. Or, perhaps, to put it more fairly, not being prepared for
Joslyw's dinner by a series of entertainments leading up to Joslyw's
dinner, has done it. My Aunt's and Doddridge's ideas of feeding
are of the plainest description: so, to come (as it were) suddenly
on a dinner like Joslyn's, is really a startler to my Health.
As to my Nerves this morning, I feel that I can't bear anything
or anybody, but that's owing to my Aunt, not Joslyw.
I can't arrive at the condition of my Nerves, because there's a
shrill voice at the back of the house, out in the road, which will go
on crying out, "Gjorgtna!" in three distinct syllables. I try to
see where the owner of the voice is, but oan't from my window.
It's fearful. "Oeor-vkb-nbr I" Then, after a few seconds' rest,
"Geoe-gee-ner!" I'd Geoegeenee her—whatever that might
be—if I caught her. If I could'see her, I'd tap at the window
severely, and threaten her.
The door of tho yard is blown open, and I see the little miscreant
now—a child of about eight or ten, or twelve, perhaps (for I never
can make out children's ages by their appearance, and there really
appears to be no rule as to when a child ought to begin to talk) is
standing in the middle of the road, calling "Geoh-gee-ner!"
Georgeener is somewhere in the distance, and won't answer. It
paralyses my dressing. I stand at the window, mesmerised by this
child. She doesn't change her key, or her emphasis, or her intona-
tion. She stands quite still, and does it mechanically. I tap my
window sharply, she can't hear. Why can I hear her f
"Geoe-gee-ner!" for the twentieth time.
I will ring. I do ring. It takes a good deal of ringing to fetch
up our enormous Housemaid at the lodgings. She is so big that she
oan't come up with one pull: three good ones do it as a rule, and
then not without a consultation with some one (generally the Cook)
invisible. The ceremony of ringing the bell for Maey is as
follows :—
One pull. No effect whatever.
Second pull. A louder one; audible as sounding down-stairs
somewhere. Indistinct murmurs also arise from below; like those
made by a distant crowd on the stage. Burden of indistinct chorus,
apparently. (Strophe) " Where'sMaey?" (Anti-strophe.) "Don't
know, tip-stairs, I think." That's another curious thing, she's
always up-stairs.
Third pull. Much louder, and of a remonstrative character.
Mem. Subject for something, "Hells and Bell-ringers, by One
of Themselves." Also, "How to Wait, by a Waiter." Think it out.
"Geor-gf.k-a'*r / /"
Third pull is immediately followed by a bell up-stairs. This
brings out Mary (she is about six feet high, and would have
made a capital companion to a plough-hoy, as a plough-girl,
if there is such a person) from somewhere above. She wants to
know, over the banisters, to save trouble, "What bell's that?"
Answer from an invisible's unrecognisable voice below, " Dininpr-
room, I think." Mary comes down lumpily. She hasn't heard
distinctly, " What bell?" she asks, rather crossly. Cook's voice
from below fancies it's Dining-room. Maey heard murmuring
something about she wishes as something, &c., &e., and Cook heard
in answer that she did, &c, &c, whatever it is; to which Mary
replies grumpily, that she (Mary) thinks as she (Cook) might, &c, &c,
and then she goes to the Dining-room and inquires, as if out of pure
curiosity, "Did you ring, Mum?" of my Aunt.
It takes all this time to get Mary to come to my door. When she
arrives it occurs to me that I have no right to interfere with a child's
holloaing Georgeener out in the road, but still, if it's a nuisance
(and it is), why not remove it?
I tell Mary from my side of the door that there is a child, &c,
&c, and will she oblige me by stepping out and sending the child
away. She will. I hear her go to the front door, but, in the inter-
val between the first bell-pull and this, Georgeener has responded
to the summons, and the child has disappeared. Mary lumps back
again, and says through the door, "There ain't none, Sir," and away
she goes up-stairs to the top of the house, bo ob to be well out of the
way of the next down-stairs bell.
I finish my dressing, and join my Aunt at breakfast.
I knock at the door, in order not to startle her, and enter. Must
be very conciliatory this morning. The wicker dove-cote is on the
table, and my Aunt is engaged at the sideboard, getting out some
seed. She has not heard me. I foresee that will happen when she
turns round. She '11 be fearfully startled, and go off into something
or other jerky—not hysterics, but a sort of spasmodic faint pecu-
liarly her own.
Shall I retire, on tiptoe, and re-enter presently. If she turned
and caught me stealing out, the consequences might be serious, and
in my present state I don't know but that I might have a fit myself.
Shall I cough? Shall I speak? Not too suddenly. She is so
engaged with her bird-seed that whatever I do she must jump.
Suddenly it occurs to me to take up the newspaper and say, ' Good
morning, Aunt." . . I say it. . . it's all over. . . . She has knocked
over the bird-seed bag, the tray, and the water, and is clutching
the sideboard with one hand, and plucking at her left side with the
other.
I wish I knew what to do in these cases.
I 've heard something about " good things " to do with hysterical
subjects—one was, I think, "Hold 'em down and stamp on "em."
Another, " Stuff a pocket-handkerchief in their mouths." Another,
"Beat their open palms." Another, " Undo the collar} give them
air" (what with? the bellows if at hand ?)

MORALS AT THE ACADEMY.
Dear Mr. Punch,
You were obliging enough to request my attendance at the
Royal Academy on the "Wednesday before the Private View. On
that Wednesday cards of admission were given to Critics only. Sir,
I was much flattered by the compliment you paid me, but I hope
that you will not send, me again on such a day. I didn't like it.
Of course I could see all the Pictures with perfect ease. In fact,
I had nothing else to do but to look at them, and I frequently had
an entire gallery to myself. The Academy meant to be very cour-
teous. But there is such a thing as too much politeness, though I
admit that it is not often seen.
I should like to ask the Academy, and you, Sir, how a fellow is
to stand in judgment on 1338 works of Art, with nobody to give him
hints, advise him, and tell him what other folks think P How can
he tell which pictures ore to be the talk of the Season unless he sees
people crowding round them? I flatter myself that I can knock off
a graphic sketch of a picture-show as well as anybody else, if I can
collect the general chatter of a room, and get a painter or two to put
me up to a few blemishes or merits. Bat to send a man into the
wilderness, as it were, and sentence him to solitary confinement
while he finds out things for himself—I say, Sir, that it is a bit of
combined editorial tyranny and academical cynicism.
However, Sir, I did my duty, as a British Critic usually does in
any circumstances. I marked my Catalogue, and I briefly report
the leading features of the Exhibition.
There were cloths on the_ floors, and covers on the sofas. A very
intelligent workman, in shirt-sleeves, was banging and cleaning the
long seat in the Sculpture Gallery. Persons were bringing up
flowers in pots, I presume for the banquet. A gentleman was
sketching the big gallery, probably for a pictorial newspaper. No
refreshments were to be procured. Anticipating this, I had bought
a Bath bun at the corner of Bond Street. This (the bun—Henri-
etta Street, but I was not so hungry as Henry) I ate at 1"30 p.m. in
Gallery No. IV.
Some of the Academicians exhibit, some do not. Mr. M ill us
has a landscape, and the moral is that a man of genius can do what-
ever he likes. In fact I am delighted to say that All the pictures
have Morals, and perhaps I may as well confine myself to pointing
these out, as mere art-criticism can be had everywhere. Mr. Cal-
deron has a splendid lady who is going to her throne, and who is
iust being finished off by her coiffeur, the moral being that the
humblest service should not be despised by the exalted. Mr. Elmore
has a beautiful girl carried away on a terrible black horse by a dead
lover, the moral being that when a lover is dead he should be for-
gotten by a well-brought-up lady. Mr. Frith has a great gambling
scene, in which the evil passions and suffering produced by that
vicious yet fascinating pursuit are set forth in an instructive manner.
Mr. Faed has a fractious child, kindly treated, showing mothers
that though wilfulness is to be whipped, indisposition should be
indulged. The President has a hunting subject, teaching us that
splendid health, in man and beast, is obtained only by exercise. Mr.
Hook has a benevolent youth extracting a thorn from the foot of a
patient dog, and the lesson is one of humanity to the brute creation,
and also that we should submit quietly to those who try to do us
good. Mr. Hor&ley's two paintings of a husband and wife, respec-
tively, warming themselves, have a subtler lesson, which is, that if
a husband neglects a wife, he may suffer for it. Mr. Knight has
some admirable portraits, the moral of which is, that no person is so
uninteresting, but that Art can invest him with interest. This, Sir,
is often shown in pictures of yourself.
Mr. Charles Landseer has three wayfarers, who warn us against
being indolent or extravagant, and thus being reduced to poverty,
though he also shows that the domestic affections survive wealth.
Among the morals taught by Mr. Leighton is one on the sea-shore,
where we find that the simplest actions may be invested with the
most exquisite grace. Mr. Poole, treating a Shakspearian subject,
warns us against hastily yielding to a belief that misfortune has

ocourred. Me. Sant's diploma picture, a schoolmaster's
daughter (appropriately placed next to a birch-wood),
sets out how successful even the young can be in instruc-
tion, if they impart it affectionately. Me. Websteb has
a patriotic work calculated to stimulate the energies of
our gallant Volunteers, and urge them to renewed efforts
to become efficient, and thus gain the love of their
country and of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cam-
bridge. Me. Wabt presents to ladies who have had the
reprehensible ambition to secure the affections of the
husbands of others, a terrible instance of the result of
such a course, an offender in that way being reduced
to sitting down on damp steps in the open air. Me.
Wells teaches us (and it would be well if some public
writers took the lesson to what they call their hearts)
that Mb. Secretary Bruce is by no means the monster
he is often called, but, though not precisely an Adonis,
a gentleman of intelligence and suavity.
It was not to be expected that the Associates, as
younger men, who have not had so much experience of
the /wickedness of the world as their superiors, should
be so earnest and impressive in the enforcement of morals;
but I am pleased to be able to state that their teaching
is all in an excellent direction, that Me. Frost points out
the inconvenience of an incomplete toilet when one may
be summoned into society; that Mb. Mabks has awell-
directed^ reproof for those who are slovenly and litter
floors with papers; that Mb. Geoboe Leslie represents
the propriety of an inferior showing thoughtful attention,
as evidenced by a charming girl pouring out refreshment
for her lovely mistress (no such attention was paid to your
Critic), that Mb. Durham has a striking illustration of
the advisability of sea-bathing; that Mb. Walker has
painted a fearful warning of the fate which will attend
a female who perseveres in unlawful courses; and that
Mb. Poynter has put in the most attractive light the
charm conferred upon beauty, when we behold it minis-
tering kindness to the animal creation.
Having thus acquitted myself of my duty as your
critic, in regard to the works of the Academicians and
Associates, I reserve notices of other productions. I now
merely remark that our Continental friends have not as
yet had time to become imbued with the same instincts
of propriety, and that however desirable it may be to
warn persons of the female sex not to be carried to Court
in carpets, such hints might be left to the Loed Cham-
berlain. It is also to be wished that the Slave Trade
could be put down, but visitors to the Royal Academy
can do little in this respect, and it would be better that
whatever exposure of that system is necessary should
be made to Sir Samuel Bakeb. I forbear to enlarge on
this topic, for fear of falling into the error which 1
reprehend in others.
Now, Sir, as regards Art itself, as illustrated at the
Academy, I would begin by saying, that if I recur to
the times of the ancient Greeks, and ask myself what
was the Grecian Ideal
JThe answer which our Contributor obtained was, as
might have been expected, idiotic, in the modern sense
of the word. He will,'therefore, forgive us for omitting
three columns of particularly instructive disquisition,
and will accept the assurance that he shall be employed
on different work in future. We subjoin bis conclusion,
however.]
Lastly, Sir, I must observe that Refreshments ought
to be provided for the Critic. I would also urge that a
cigar might be permitted to him while musing on the
works he is sent to judge. On this head I am sustained
by Academical authority. I cite the following lines
from a new poem, the "Age of Stucco," by Henry
O'Neil, A.R.A. Of smoking, that good and wise man
says,
"Nor think the practice idleness destroys,
The half unconscious act promotes its joys,
Yet aids the mind in its attempt to chain
The thoughts engendered in the busy brain."
I have the honour to be, Sir, Your faithful Servant,
WlNXELMANN FUSELI DoBBS.

YOU'LL MAKE ME VERY ANGRY."
F course Mr. Punch is familiar
but he means by no means to b<
vulgar, when he shouts out to
every Bishop, in something like
the words of a once famous
American song—
"0, stick your mitre tighter, anil roll
up your lawn sleeve.
For Miai.l and Old Modo are
coming, I bcliev*."
It is no joking matter. The
Honourable and Dissenting Mem-
ber for Bradford is about to
make an onslaught upon the
Church of England. He is stated
to suppose that he shall have
eighty-five votes. That is not
much. But if he pours on the
Church half the fury with whicli
he assails the Press, there will
soon bo "mitres on the green."
The newspapers do not report
him and the other orators of the
Liberation Society fully. Edi-
tors are stupid enough to think
that it will be time enough to
give importance to agitators
when they shall have achieved
Something, however little. Mean-
while it is believed that the
Public is base enough to take
more interest in the siege of
Paris, Low-Lowe's Leap, the
International Show, and even Chester Races. Me. Miai.l thus
thunders at the newspapers:—
"Whenever we say we will bear it no longer, they will do something for
us. Commercial interest is with them the main interest. Half-a-dozen
columns are given on what is going on in France, a column and a half is given
for sporting intelligence, and then they have not room to report the proceed-
ings of a movement upon which they will have to live for the next six or ten
years. We, Protestant Dissenters of England, are engaged in a mighty cause,
and we will not stand it—we won't endure it at all. We, who sustain
them, and who sustain through them partly the Liberal party—I say, we
won't stand this thing much longer!"
"Away to Heaven, respective lenity,
And 'tire-eyed Fury be my conduct Now!"
But, once more, it is no joking matter, either for the Hierarchy or
the Journalists. This is the terrible enemy who is in arms against
both, and " ready to smite twice, and smite no more." The Bishops
may take care of themselves—'tis work at which some of them are
not unapt—but we scarcely know what the Press is to do, because we
do not know what Mb. Mi am. is going to do to the Press. Only, it is
something very dreadful indeed. Could not a Deputation of Editors
wait upon him, each olad in a penance-sheet made of his own
journal, and humbly beg for mercy Y Punch is at present unequal
to saying more, except that—
There was a schismatic called Miaxl,
Whose wrath spirted out of its vial,
Says he to the Press,
"You'll report me, I guess,
Or I '11 hang you all up without trial."

"MORE GLADIATORS!"
{Roman Cry.)
Mb. Punch reads (with qualified satisfaction) this, among the
"literary items," of the week :—
"A new Review is in contemplation. It is believed that there is room for
such a periodical, if conducted upon the old principle of giving Slashing
Articles, instead of mere essays, or pull's. Wo believe the name has not yet
been fixed upon.''
We have the greatest pleasure in presenting the intending Slasher
with a name. The Girenoquartcrly Iteriew. But it will come a
Crasher. "The world is weary of the past," as Shelley says. The
cry of the Arena bores us.
The Fair Unrepresented.
Why ought not Women to have the Suffrage t Because we are
afraid of their votes, and not of their violence.
"IN THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY."
May-Month, when the mind runs on flowers, till even the omnibus-
cads stick a bud in their button-holes, and a spray of lilac under their
horses' head-stalls! How it disgusts Punch to hear conceited idiots,
members of the Horticultural Society, crowing over the conserva-
tories and sub-tropical gardens, the flower-shows, and acclimatisa-
tion feats of the present day!
I sav, our ancestors were wiser than we are in horticulture, as in
most things.
Had not their old-fashioned, fragrant, perennial-planted lush
and luxuriant gardens a braver show, a better smell, than these
pretentious, purse-proud, mushroom-lived, pot-plant gardens of the
Sesent day, when we change our flowers with our fashions, and
iug our "bedding-out" bravery ready made from the foreing-
housCj as the ladies do their spring-bonnets from the milliner's show-
room t
Gardens, indeed! I say, gardening has gone to pot altogether.
Scotch gardeners! Pooh 1 Pedants, with a half-educated itch for
Latin names, and the experiences of an Arctic climate: all for botany
and hot wateT: with more belief in glass than in celestial sun-
shine. Givo Punch an old open-air English garden, with its masses
of cabbage-roses; its beds of fragrant herbs, marjoram and mignon-
ette, musk and lavender, southern-wood and sweet basil; its wall-
flowers and stocks; its clove-pinks and carnations.
Think of an old English hostelry, with clean sheets, smelling of
lavender, and sweet herbs stuck in the windows, and then of a new
English railway hotel, with its faint odour of ready-made soup, and
its general suggestion of gas-leakage.
Think of old Izaak Walton, on a May morning, by the side of
Lea River, where now stand gas-works and patent manure manu-
factories, looking down the meadows, and seeing here a boy gather-
ing lilies and lady-smocks, and there a girl cropping culver-keys
and cowslips, all to make garlands suitable to this present month of
May; and these and many other field-flowers so perfuming the air
that he thought "that very meadow like that field in Sicily of
which Diodobus speaks, where the perfumes arising from the place
make all dogs that hunt on it to fall off, and to lose their hottest
scent." Think of the smells of Lea river-side now!
Think of walking arm-in-arm with his Piscator and Venator
in the cool shade ot a honeysuckle hedge within a milo of Totten-
ham High-cross!
Think of an old English farm-house parlour, low-roofed and oaken
raftered, with old English beau-pots in the broad window-seats!
Think of . . . anything but what Punch is forced to think of
here in London now-a-days.
Think of every sight and smell that seems most akin to May, and
it will be old English all over.
Old England revelled in flowers, loved them, fresh and dry. Bat
among them, strewed them on its floors, slept in sheets that smelt of
them, distilled them for drinks, ate them in salads! For proof,
here is an Old English spring salad of 1G82. You will find it in the
Food Journal's domestic recipes for May:—■
"There is a sort of eallet commonly gathered in the spring, consisting of
divers young buds and sprouts both of trees and shrubs, the which, being
gathered discreetly, with nothing but what is very young and tender, and so
that no one thing exceed the other, but there may be a fine agreement in
their relish, if so, it will be very acceptable to many. Violets, small sprouts
of burnet, young leaves of primroses and flowers, mints, sorrel, buds of goose-
berries, roses, barberries, flowers of bun-age, bugloss, cowpaugles, and arch-
angel."
There is flowery food with a vengeance! Think of New England's
lambs cropping it, as Old England's hard-a-weathers did, to the
sweetening of their breaths, the purification of their bloods, and the
general encouragement of a sweet, green spring-time turn of mind.
Black Mail and Bed.
How much happier we are than the French! We have no Com-
mune: Ave have no Civil War. Our Ministers gratify our populace
first by allowing them to dictate the national expenditure, and
secondly by imposing the whole weight of it on the upper and
middle classes in the Income-tax. Perhaps the French would be as
much at peace as ourselves, if the respectable part of them would
only submit to be plundered.
Ministerial Irish Melody.

A CABINET QUESTION.
Given, Ministers with nothing to live upon but their
precarious earnings, how long would it be_ before they
would discover the possibility of a substitute for the
Income-tax?
SEVERITY OF THE SESSION.
Unsparing retrenchment has reduced numerous clerks and
labourers to pauperism. Extraordinary estimates have been met by
necessarily heavy, but unnecessarily partial and grievous, taxation.
The liberty of individuals is threatened by legislation influenced by
Sabbatarian teetotallers. _ Anxiety and distress have been inflicted
on thousands of struggling families, and very large numbers of
persons are made more or less miserable by accomplished or immi-
nent Acts of Parliament.
Example may teach people to bear the afflictions which they ex-
perience under the hands of a chastening Government with fortitude.
The Legislature, which has impoverished them, and menaces their
comforts and enjoyments, would set them that example by volun-
tarily submitting themselves to a certain severity of self-denial
whicn would be particularly seasonable. Accordingly, perhaps
Ma. Gladstone will invite the House of Commons, with a view to
the despatch of unpleasant public business, to forego, for this year,
their accustomed observance of that special parliamentary holiday,
the Derby. Or, should our good Premier feel reluctant thus to
exhibit himself in the character of an austere pedagogue, his genial
Chancellor of the Exchequer will doubtless_ be_ only too happy
to deliver his proposal of no Derby holiday for him in the quality of
Usher. Perhaps, to make it the more gracious, Bob Matchbox will
point it with a Latin joke.
Ninnies at Full Length.
Let us cease to call the confiscation of Sixpence in the pound out
of some people's incomes, the Income-tax. If we call it a tax at all,
instead of calling it a robbery, let us term it the Nincom-tax. Thus
we shall characterise, with an elegant abbreviation, the class of
persons who quietly endure it.
Spohttno Sailors.—" Epsom Salts."
THE PREMIER ON THE BEAUTIFUL.
On his legs at the Royal Academy Dinner, Mr. Gladstone spoke,
and said:—
"We lire in times when the extraordinary activity of the human mind in
regard to all material pursuits more and more demanda the counterpoise of
steady and sedulous cultivation of all that pertains to the true culture of the
human spirit. That study of beauty—I might venture to say, without fear
of being misunderstood, that worship of beauty—to which your vocation calls
you, is among the most powerful of those counteracting means to which we
must look to check the tendency of mankind to become in an increasing
degree the slaves of mere material purposes and enjoyments."
Hear, hear! One way in which Artists study beauty, or, we may
venture to say without fear of being misunderstood, worship beauty,
is,that of surveying beautiful landscapes with a studious eye
in order to paint them. How will this study of beauty be
possible when the scenery which constitutes beautiful landscapes
shall have been wholly destroyed, as it is in course of being by the
Progress which keeps on improving it off the face of the earth P
Hear, our Premier. If scenery is worth painting, much more is it
worth preserving; and is not what is true of the flora equally true of
the fauna t Hooray for Gladstone! The Statesman has spoken
out, encouraged, evidently, by a late Division relative to an open
space, threatened with enclosure by Philistines. He means to check
the tendency which has been exhibited by Ministers to become in an
increasing degree the slaves of mere material purposes and enjoy-
ments. The New Forest Bill has been abandoned. All the remain-
ing beauty of Epping Forest, let us hope, will be spared too.
and Peace.
The French, borne back from cutting German throats,
Forthwith set to at cutting one another's;

At what a rate mankind are growing brother^.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
onday, May 8. The
University Tests
Bill was discussed in
the Upper Chamber,
and Lord Salis-
bury, Chancellor of
Oxford, moved an
Amendmentoreating
a new Test. His
great object was, he
said, to uphold the
supremacy of Reli-
gious Belief. This
very proper object
he proposed to effect
by calling upon all
Tutors and Pro-
fessors to make a
solemn declaration
that they would not
teach any opinion
opposed to the teach-
ing and authority of
the Bible. He be-
lieved thatthe young
men at the Uni-
versities would be
exposed to very ter-
rible dangers, unless
this or some such
security were taken.
LOED KlMBERLEY
objected to this new
Test, because it was
not wanted, and
because it was vague.
The Universities
must be the reflex of
national thought.
The Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol (Dr. Ellicott) said he
believed that the Bill, un-amended, would bring a judgment.
The Archbishop of York believed nothing of the kind, and said
that while the nation valued Religion, it would be taught at the
Universities. The proposed Test would affect none but men of the
most sensitive conscience. We should rather depend on stirring up
religious thought, and assisting those who laboured to promote it.
The Duke of Somerset reminded the House that Oxford knew
how to take tests in a non-natural sense. The proposal would spoil
the Bill, and had no doubt been introduced for that purpose.
Protect Christianity! That might survive even the House of
Lords.
Lord Harrowby supported the Amendment, and the Bishop of
Lincoln (Dr. Wordsworth) protested against the Bill, partly
because it would be a great hardship to parents, whom Lord Salis-
bury had said were considered by the Advanced party at the Uni-
versities as " very undesirable appendages to Undergraduates."
The Marquis of Lansdowne said the Test would not apply to
the Coaches, who did so much of the real work of teaching.
The Bishop of Oxford (Dr. Mackaress) pointed out the emi-
nently religious character of the Keble College, which had neither
tests nor endowments.
Lord Carnarvon thought that the Amendment would meet the
views of the Dissenters, whom he warned against alliance with
Secularists.
The Bishop of Carlisle (Dr. Harvey Goodwin) said that the
test would be an insult to some, idle in the case of others, and use-
less in all cases.
The Bishop of Salisbury (Dr. Moberley) had, as a Head-
master, Bent thousands of young men to Oxford, but had done so
with a heavy heart, because of the Hood of infidelity that had swept
over that place. The test would not do much, but such as it was, he
approved it cordially.
Lord Westbury said that infidelity in Oxford had not arisen
from want of tests or of bigotry. The test would expel the con-
scientious and admit the irreligious. He had, however, visited
Oxford lately, and was inclined to think that the imputations on it
were slanderous.
The Bishop of Manchester (Dr. Fraser) described the Amend-
ment as panic-legislation, and unstatesmanly.
Lord Salisbury carried his Amendment, on division, by 77 to
66—majority, 5 only.
He also carried Amendments, but by the small majorities of 8 and
of 2, for excepting Heads of Colleges from the Bill, and for prevent-
ing changes by any but Parliamentary authority in qualifications for
Headships ana Scholarships.
After this interesting debate (which involved questions of as much
gravity as any that could be submitted to Parliament, and which
can, oi course, be recorded only in an appropriate tone), the Testa
Bill went through Committee. It passed on Friday, after a protest
from the Lord-Chancellor against the Amendments.
In the Commons, very different topics came up. Mr. Punch is
honoured, if not happiiied, in stating that both " Bung and Baron"
have obtained signal victories. The Nobleman has overthrown the
Local Burdens Bill, and the Publican has overthrown all the
Licensing part of the Licensing Bill, and will most possibly defeat
the rest. The Premier announced these facts.
We then had a debate on going into Committee on the Army Bill.
The fact is that "the Colonels" mean to crush it if they can. After
a defeat by 250 to 187 to-night, they went on dividing on the
question of adjournment, and after the fifth division Mr. Gladstone
gave way, saying that he should like to fight it out with them, but
had consideration for Members who were being kept up till two in
the morning.
Tuesday. Government made a revelation of exceeding shabbiness.
Captaiw Burgoyne, the gallant officer lost with the Captain, hod
incurred liabilities of about £500, for the benefit of that ship. His
widow is asked to pay them, the Admiralty referring creditors to the
poor lady. This is felt to be "too bad " in the painful circumstances.
But Routine must be respected. However, Captain Burooyne
having had a right to draw for £210 more, for furniture for him-
self, than he did draw for, in its preternatural liberality, the
Admiralty will let this sum go in aid of Mrs. Burooyne. Admiral
Byno was shot, as VOLTAIRE said, pour encourager let autres, and
widows are left to pay debts contracted by their husbands in the
interest of the Sea-Service.
In the Commons Mr. Miall made his long-mehaccd attack upon the
Church of England. He moved a Resolution to the effect that it
was expedient, at the earliest practicable period, to imitate in regard
to her the course that had been adopted in regard to her Hibernian
Sister. It is due to Mr. Miall to say that he was calm, argumen-
tative, and able. He considers the Church to be a Failure and an
Injustice. Previously to his speech there was presented from Brad-
ford (for which he site) a petition in which 21,700 ratepayers prayed
the House not to do what he asked. According to Mr. Dod, there
are only 21,471 eleotors in Bradford.
Mother Churoh was gallantly championed. Mr. Bruce, Home
Secretary, praised her, and saw no reason for the attack. But Sib
Roundell Palmer made the speech of the night, and eloquently
argued Jhat the Church fulfilled ner duties, and was working better
than Dissent. To destroy her would be to prepare the way for
Revolutions. Mr. Richard complained of her ascendency in Wales,
where nearly all the lower class are Dissenters. Among the
speakers was Dr. Ball, who naturally smarted from the Irish cam-
paign, and hit out hard at the Ministers for being half-hearted in
their defence of. the Church. Mr. Leatham, supporting the motion,
objected to Dissenters being led by a Cabinet of Churchmen, and
intimated that it might be broken up by displeased Liberals.
The leaders then went in. Mr. Disraeli was historical, and
showed the dangers of destroying churches. He declared, that the
majority in the nation were for the Church. Now that we were
educating the people, the more they would desire a learned clergy,
a refined ritual, and the beautiful offices of the Establishment. He
thought there was an end of subversion; the God Terminus had
been discovered. He called on the Premier to let his trumpet give
no uncertain sound.
Ma. Gladstone distinctly declared that the Government would
oppose such a resolution, both then, and in future. For 1300 years
the Church of England had entwined itself with the hearts of the
people of England, and could not now be torn away. He admitted
that a combination of Dissenters might break up the Liberal party,
but such a consideration should not be a governing motive with him.
The motion was at variance with the established convictions of the
country, and before Mr. Miall could convert the House to his
opinions he must convert to those opinions the majority of the people
of England.
Mr. Miall admitted that the House had raised its character as a
deliberative assembly to the highest pitch by listening with so much
attention, silence, and good temper to statements repugnant to the
feelings of a large majority on both sides. [Well said, Mr. Miall.
If there was tact in this speech, it was gentlemanly tact. And you
spoke justly. Is there any other Assembly in the World that would
have so behaved ?]

quoted in the debate. Let Mr. Punch have his due. He mentioned
last week that Me. Miall expected to have eighty-five votes.
Wednesday was remarkable only for another little defeat of the
Government on a Bill, introduced by Me. Mtjntz, for the Exemption
of Charities from Bates. It was opposed by Ms. Stanfeld, and that
gentleman being interrupted by cries of " Divide, 'vide, 'vide!"
charged his opponents with wanting to snap a division, because they
were in a majority. His opponents thought he meant to talk the
Bill out (that is up to the hour of Wednesday adjournment), so they
made a dreadful noise, and in the end beat the Government by 117
to 84. Then they made a still

Thursday. Lord Houghton asked Lord Salisbury
his University Test rather than risk a collision with the
Loed Salisbury, of course, utterly refused to do so, and in allusion
to his small majority, reminded the House of what Clarendon said
about the division against the Bishops, "when those who liked
them, liked them less than dinner." Loed Geanviixe (who is
reputed to have, to his honour, good judgment in Epicureanism of
the artistic sort, and to whom of course the taunt did not apply) pro-
tested against such an imputation on his fellow peers.
Loed Salisbury then spoke on a matter on which he is an autho-
rity, an Indian grievance. Merchants in Calcutta and Madras wish
for a Commission to inquire into Indian finance, the annual migra-
tion of the Government, and the constitution of the Legislative
Council. The Duke of Argyll denied that there was a grievance,
eulogised Loed Mayo, and said that the petitioners were only
enraged at an Income-tax. Quite enough cause for enragement,
dear Duke of Argyll, and Punch wishes that a certain class in
England had more of the Indian spirit.
Nothing like definitions. Me. Lowe gave a definition of direct
and indirect taxation. The former he represented to be that which
the payer could not anyhow recover from the community. We pay
sixty per cent, of indirect, twenty-five per cent, direct, and the rest
neither. Mr. Punch trusts that the nation is better after this lucid
explanation.
Comfort for private folks who now and then commit a carelessness
or an oversight. Such serious blundering was made with the
Income-tax Bill that it had to be withdrawn. Mr. Gladstone
was very sorry. Pooh! a trifle, when one has several things to think
about.

Friday. The Commons sat in the morning, and discussed the
Westmeath Outrages Bill, which was expounded by Lobd Habting-
ton. Some Irish Members made speeches against it pro forma, and
the debate was adjourned. A Colonial Debate followed, and Me.
Rnatchbull Hugessen made an admirable speech, contending that
the Colonial Office watched with the most affectionate care over all
Mrs. BEiTANifiA's chickens at a distance.
Debate on the conduct of an Asiatic Premier and his master. The
Minister is stated to have invited seventeen of his sovereign's rela-
tives to dinner, and to have murdered them all. The Indian Govern-
ment deposes the Nawab of Tonk, the sovereign in question, as an
accomplice. He sends an Embassy to allege that he has been un-
fairly used. The matter stands over until Sib Stafford Nortti-
cote returns from America. It is impossible for English persons to
sanction such methods of getting rid of poor relations, and we hope
that the Nawab will elear himself of complicity with his energetic
Premier.

N most cases Mr. Punch lets
his Correspondents alone
with great severity, and he
heartily wishes that most of
them would treat him in the
same manner. In fact, he
has very few Correspondents,
strictly speaking, for the
word implies that writers get
answers, and this is by no
means the state of affairs
between Mr. Punch and
myriads whose letters pass
from his letter-box to his
waste-paper basket. Now
and then, however, he makes
an exception " to encourage
the others," and he is inclined
to encourage those whom it
may concern by making an
example of the writer of the
following letter. That writer
is, unhappily, a clergyman
of the Church of England by
Law Established, and Mr.
Punch allows the "clerk's

A happy thought is the notion proposed by Captain Ducane,

means of Convict Labour. This employment of Convicts would be
an admirable method of utilising our moral sewage. Would we
could still further utilise it by turning convicts into soldiers, and
compelling them to fight for their country. There must be some-
thing odd in the nature of things, or some mistake in our idea of the

less class of the community food for powder.

MY HEALTH.
esr Thing to Do.—Ring for
Doddridge. Ring vio-
lently. Same work as
before; Mary from up-
stairs. Cook from below,
Landlady from somewhere
else inquiring if that was
the Drawing-room bell,
and finally, by accident,
Doddridge comes in and
finds my Aunt having
fits on one side of the
room, and me on the
other looking at her. I
tell her, I can't make out
what's the matter with
my Aunt. This sets Dod-
dridge off. She exclaims,
"0, Master George, how
can you say such things!"
I ascertain afterwards
from her that my observa-
tion about " not knowing
what was the matter with
. my Aunt" conveyed the
idea to her (Doddridge's)
mind, that my Aunt was
intoxicated.
My Aunt recovers, and
I rush up-stairs for her
pocket-handkerchief, sub-
sequently found shut in
the piano.
"I hope," I observe, when all is calm again, "that I didn't cause
you any inconvenience last night," meaning by sending my note to
say I was staying out to dinner.
No, George," she replies, sadly, and sighs.
Mem. to Myself. Better drop the conversation. Two words more,
and tears. Recommence with an entire change of subjeot presently.
I notice that Charlie, the little dog, is limping. I pity him, and say
so. ("Love me, love my," &c. Politic)
My Aunt replies, rather severely, "0, there's nothing the matter
with him; it's only affectation."
My Aunt, I discover, sets down almost all maladies (not her own)
to affectation. Complaining to her that my nose has become red,
and is certainly swollen, she replies, "Nonsense, it's all affectation."
She wishes to know, before I go out, if I am coming back to dinner
to-day, as she really never was so much frightened as when she
received that message yesterday.
"Ah, it did indeed!" chimes in Doddridge; "you should have
more consideration, Master George."
I feel inclined to say, "0, what confounded nonsense !" but what
I do say is, that I am very sorry, and I am certainly coining back
to dinner to-day.
"We can't give you such things as you get at the hotel," says my
Aunt, plaintively.
I reply cheerily that "There's no dinner I enjoy more than a
simple cnop."
The word " chop" does it. My Aunt bursts into tears. Heaven
only knows why.
Mem. When with my Aunt avoid all mention'of chops. And
N. B. Note down while staying with my Aunt at Ramsgate what
subjects make her cry—in order to avoid them. By the way, as I jot
this down in my note-diary, it suddenly occurs to me that the other
day, when we were talking about dancing parties, I remarked to my
Aunt that I had enjoyed a hop somewhere or other. Scarcely had
the word " hop " escaped me, than my Aunt, with eyes gradually
filling, repeated it once, looked me full in the face, then, turning
away, burst into tears, just as she has done at the word " chop."
Psychological Query.—Do all words ending in " op " make my Aunt
cry? If so, one knows what to avoid. Might try one more to make
certain. Three would form a sort of quorum ana decide it. Mem.
To try "pop " on the earliest opportunity, and see how she stands it.
Feeling that I am helpless here, I retire. I As I go down the passage
the dove coos and the dog barks. I feel worried. This sort of thing
is trying and wearing. I must thank my Aunt for her kindness, ana
get some one to send me a telegram to say—
"Come at once. Business of Importance."
Then I can get away.
Budd is just passing the door. "Hallo 1" says he, "off to the
bath of the Turk, eh?'r
1 tell him " yes," and add that I don't feel very well to-day, and
I can't make it out.
Budd, who looks as fresh as a young American apple, replies,
"Ah, I thought you were a little 'on' last night. Eh?" Here
he chuckles, and then adds, "I feel a bit chippy myself this
morning."
Is it possible that after all my diagnosis, pain over eyes, aching
head, unstrung nerves, and Hot Nose, that I must enter myself in my
Diary of Health thus: 2'he day of 18 . Morning "A
bit chippy."
Budd whistles to Growler (his brown bear of a dog), who sulks
after us at a heavy pace, and we proceed to the West Cliff to the
Turkish Baths at the Cramville.
"This," explains Budd, "is the time for going to be washed;" this
is what he calls the Turkish Bath process, and adds that he invariably
comes out at this hour.
Note in Ramsgate Out of Season.—The few people here are as
regular in their times as the mechanical figures on a clock, or on
an old-fashioned organ. I can tell what time it is on the East
or West Cliff, by observing what people are out, weather per-
mitting.
Further Notes on the Out-of-Season Time here.—Observations by
Budd and self. There are so few residents, or residing lodgers
[Amendment proposed to Budd by me, "Sojourners,"—which he
rejects as being a trifle profane. I assure hi™ it is not so, but he
is positive as to having heard the word somewhere in church, and
prefers to say " residing lodgers." Note. Better not proceed with dis-
cussion. Better to feel, interiorly, superior to prejudice, and say
nothing. I feel superior, and we continue our walk and taUx.]
There are residing lodgers whom one comes to know by sight like
the dramatis persona in a small play.
You seldom see a West-Clifnan on the East Cliff, or an East-
Cliffian on the West Cliff. I believe he, or she, would be imme-
diately treated as a trespasser, and, after a few warnings, prose-
cuted with the utmost rigour of the law.
The houses of tho East-Cliffians on Wellington Terrace (or
Crescent) are guarded, probably against any incursions of West-
Clifflans, by a strong iron railing. Behind this they can breathe
defiance at the invader from their dining-room windows. They
have a garden railed in, a promenade also railed in, and a part of
it, in a corner, so cunningly railed off as to cause a stranger, who
sees an East-Cliflian sitting within its boundary, to wonder how on
earth he got there. Whether there is a gate to this harbour of
refuge, or whether there is a sort of gate, or no gate at all, or whether
the East-Cliffians possess the secret of getting through or over the
railings, or whether it opens to some secret " Open Sesame!" con-
juration, are problems which a visitor will probably never solve,
specially if accident of temporary residence identifies him in the least
with West-Cliffian interests.
The East Cliff is separated from the West Cliff by a respectable
square of the early marine-lodging-house style of architecture, by,
also, a worse down-hill road than usual from the respectable square to
the town, by the town itself, by (on the west ascent side) a jumble
of houses, taken apparently at random from some superfluous lots
originally intended (but not used) for villas at Brompton, or St.
John's Wood, for a back street at Brighton, or any street, Soho,
and placed here to be aired, and get a sniff of the sea.
On the ascent from the town to the West Cliff the visitor (we
notice) will pass through a pleasing modulation of scents, varying
with the weather.
We are now descending from the West and going Eastward Ho!
The dramatis persona, or clockwork figures on the West Cliff, are,
first, an old gentleman got up to within an inoh of his nose, to resemble
the late Duke op Wellington. He is never without a stick, which
he shakes playfully at children, and seems to be on terms with
everyone, and very good terms too, apparently, with himself. This
figure is wound up for an hour and a half's walk in the morning,
and wound in again about luncheon time, to reappear (perhaps re-
quiring rather stronger winding this time), at four o'clock in the
afternoon; and, the works going down (as it were) with the sun, the
Shade of the late Duke disappears for good about six, probably to
wind himself up with dinner, wind himself into bed, and wind him-
self up again the next morning in time for his usual walk.
Secondly, there is the Wild-looking Lady with a fat umbrella—[I
dare say it has been once thin, but carelessness has brought it to this
state. Mem. Note that. Moral in umbrellas. Why not extract a
moral from everything or anything? Why not P Will try]—and a
pocket full of tracts. She oomes out particularly strong on a bright
Sunday. I have never seen her offer the late Duke op Wellington's
Shade a tract. I think if she did, he'd waive her off with his stick.
Thirdly, the Young Married Couple, who are always admiring the
sea, and examining the horizon together, as if they could see their
future somewhere about in the distance. Fourthly, the Old Married
Couple who sit on a bench for an hour or so before dinner, shake
themselves, rise slowly, as if about to walk a minuet, and than retire.
Then come regularly in the afternoon two Elderly Gentlemen, one
a vieux militaire with only his moustache and military stock (no
collars) left of his former profession, and the other evidently a

Commercial Gent sings :—
The Income-tax, in theory,
No doubt, is quite unfair,

To some that fine who bear.
For instance, to your needy Clerk,
Whose salary is known;
He cannot keep his Income dark,
Whereas I can my own.

Declaring small returns.

A conscientious goose,
I should but prices need to raise,
And wages to reduce.

From Income-tax are free,
Of course it cannot injure you—
It little touches me.

The man who would have a finger in the pie thought
he had got his hand in, but instead of that he managed
to put his foot into it. He has now not a leg to stand on,
and being thrown off his balance, has utterly lost his
footing in society. He is out at elbows besides, and all
respectable members of the community keep him at
arm's length.

civilian. They talk politics loudly and energetically, and, appa-
rently, with the invariable result of "exeunt quarrelling."
There is the Handsome Widow, whom the vieux mihtaire stops to
salute profoundly in the midst of his most animated discussion, and
who holds converse sweet and low (in tone, of course, though pro-
bably on the most elevated themes) with the gentle High Church
Curate, whose large black wide-awake is the nearest approach he
can procure to the peculiarly ecclesiastical hat of the Spanish or
Belgian priests. Then there are the learned Benedictines from the
Monastery, West Cliff (very unlike "the monks of old, what a jovial
race they were! "), who come out with their healthy and happy-
looking young collegians at certain hours, and whose church, at
the extremity of West Cliff, is one of the.late Welby Pugln's
gems of Gothic design.
Punctually at three o'clock out come another pair of Elderly Gen-
tlemen (not politicians), who stand still the greater part of their
time, pointing out nothing "in the offing" and disputing as to what
it isn't.
There are plenty of children, nursery-maids, and dogs. Finally,
there is my Aunt and her dog, with Doddridge in attendance sym-
pathetically. Charlie gives my Aunt much trouble on account of
his "affectation" of lameness, and (being led with a string) by his
great affability, and apparent desire to be on the best possible terms
with other dogs, whether bigger or less than himself.
Charlie has also taken to shivering lately, which my Aunt denounces
as " really intolerable affectation, but which Doddridge asserts is
a sort of spasm, which to her (Doddridge) is not entirely unknown.
Attributing this in her own case to a want of some mysterious and
invisible flannel, she has set about to make a sort of miniature
Jersey, to be worn by Charlie when out for an airing, and not unlike
the small horse-cloth used for pet Italian greyhounds.
It is his first day of wearing it, and the fashion attracts the atten-
tion of several intelligent dogs. My Aunt walks along—Charlie
jerking, growling, barking; and starting—pretending to ignore the
pack at her heels, to which Doddridge nervously acts as the
whipper-ou*, with her parasol.
MINISTERIAL MATERIALISM.
Some physiologists affirm, others deny, the existence of an imma-
terial vital ^principle in living organised bodies. Mr. Lowe's Budget
is an organised body incorporating a vital principle which, according
to Mr. Gladstone, the Government maintained in amending it by
rendering increased taxation a simple addition to the burden borne
solely by the victims of the Income-tax. The Vital Principle of the
Budget so amended is certainly not immaterial. It is, on the con-
trary, something very hard, and a most serious matter. The Vital
Principle of the Ministerial Budget is Confiscation.
ROMANCE OF THE OCEAN.
In its late cruise amongst the West India Islands, by the account
of the Army and Navy Gazette, the Flying Squadron has been
getting on swimmingly—like flying fish in the water. The British
Navy can boast of an officer who must be acknowledged to be a
much more prodigious one than Vanderdecken. With a Flying
Squadron under his command, Rear-Admiral Beat/champ Seymoub
eclipses the Flying Dutchman.
Capable of Further Improvement.
The new Court Suit is handsome and becoming, especially in
velvet, but the Sword is still a weapon of offence, and it is high time
that the Cocked Hat was exploded. So Chauncy Peyton thinks,
who had to be present officially at the opening of the International
Exhibition on May Day, and his wife fully agrees with him.

There 'a a Tory alarmist article in Blackwood's Magazine;
It's called the " Battle of Dorking," and has made a great sensation;
It Vput in the month of a Grandfather, who desoribes what ho has seen,
When England was invaded, and ceased to be a nation.
It tells how a German army landed, somewhere 'twixt Deal and Dover,—
Our fleet, at the time, being, most of it, just where it should not have been;
How the few ships that were in the Channel were sunk, smashed, and sailed
over;
How our Line, Volunteers, and Militia by the foe were chawed up clean:
How, about Leith Hill and Dorking, we got an awful thrashing,
And a second somewhere near Richmond; then further resistance was idle;
How through our suburban roofs and walls the German shells came crashing;
Till Bismarck put his hook in our nose, and in our jaws his bridle:
By our bungling defence on land and sea shows us utter noodles and silly asses
Faints our parlours and pantries made free with by High and Low Genua

And harrows up the best feelings of pater- and mater-familiases.

While their fair-haired little darlings—which a horror even worser is
Than g^en'ral bouleversement, bombardment, beating, and bobbery—
Are having their dear little brains (lashed out. at the doors of their own
nurseries,
Till Old England is given up helpless to organised German robbery.
Her colonies rent from her, her dependencies independent:
Her youth deserting her stagnant shores, no longer a land of Goshen;
Her manufactures gone with the coal, the basis of her ascendant;
And Britannia a rotten huUr upon an idle ocean.
So easy it is for the foe to invade this Mammon-worship-
ping island—
So easy to prove the foundations we build our hopes on,
vapour—
So easy to turn a Channel of twenty miles' sea to dry
land-
So easy, in fact, to crumple up Old England—upon
paper!
There's a fable, how once in iEsop's days a Man with a
Lion beside him,
Was admiring a group—say in Ebony—where soma
artist of the day ,
Had carved a Lion on the ground, and a hunter trium-
phant astride him:
"Behold," said the Man, "how human brains bring
brute force under sway."
The Lion smiled—as one that smiles when treated to
pompous platitudes—
"Ah," said he, "my friend, if the sculptor had been
Lion instead of Man,
How easy it would have been for him to have reversed
the attitudes,
And, instead of the Man the Lion, made the Lion
bestride the Man."
So Ebony's Article-writer might have shifted colours and
figures—
Have given England the Lion's part and Germany
that of the mouse,
Made our fleet floor their transports, our Enfields their
needle-triggers,
Had he but hailed from Gladstone's, 'stead of Dizzy's,
side of the House.
The "Battle of Dorking" he calls his fight—'tis clear
he's no game chicken—
In fact, I believe, that fighting fowls your Dorkings
never are—
Though they take kindly to cramming, and when roasted
are pretty nicking—
But this Dorking bird seems to be a cross between
Dung-hill Cock and Canard.
War-Office and Admiralty may have their share of
bungle and blunder;
But John Bcxl is not yet the brainless ass that Black-
wood's prophet would make him;
We may grudge the cost of our Army's strength, and of
our Navy's thunder,
But if the British Lion's asleep, 'twill prove no joke to
NOMENCLATURE IN NOVELS.
The Author of the Fight at Dame Europa's School
has produced a Novel, entitled Tom Pippin's Wedding.
The name of Tom Pippin suggests that or the friend of
our youth, Tom Pipes. That naval hero, had he been
wedded, might be appropriately said to have been
spliced; but one would rather describe a Pippin in like
case as grafted.
The Favoured Many.
The prole taires in this country used to be called " The
Great Unwashed." That was before the establishment of
Baths and Wash-houses for the Labouring Classes. Now
the policy of Direct Taxation announced by Govern-
ment, will constitute those Classes the Great Untaxed.
Thoughtful Care.
It should be made known at the May Meetings that
Government provides for all the wants of those in its
employment, as is evident from the circumstance that an
item in the accounts of Public offices is a charge for
"Clerical Assistance."

NO JOKE FOR JURORS.
A crowded Court and an empty Jury-box! Special Jurors not to
be had for love or money; no, not for a guinea a day: not even
compellable to attend by fines for non-attendance of from £10 to
£500. No wonder,
seeing Special Jurors
muBt be men either
legally entitled to be
called esquires.bank-
ers, or merchants, or
occupying private
dwelling - houses
rated at 100 a-year.
Such men have either
business or pleasure
to attend to, worth,
to many of them, the
sacrifice of several
hundred pounds,
better afforded than
a week or a fort-
night's time spent in
tiresome attention to
other people's con-
cerns. To induce
such men not to
shirk such employ-
ment if they possibly
can, it would be ne-
cessary to pay them
for it at the same
rate as that of the
fees received by
their fellow labour-
ers, the Counsel.
In the meanwhile,
if Lord Chief Jus-
tice Bovtll, in the
Court of Common
Pleas, waiting to try
Tichborne v. Tich-
borne, had but held
up his finger for
Special Jurors, who
can doubt that ten
times as many as
were wanted would
have immediately
offered to rush into
the box, which can
contain but twelve?
Plenty of people
having no occupation
of their own, would
make love to the em-
ployment of Special
Juror in any case of
popular interest; in
any case whatsoever
for the consideration
of a guinea a day.
Why not open the
Special Jury list to
voluntary aPPli"
cants, duly qualified
for enrolment? They
could give the case
before them their
whole attention. But
how can a juror
attend to evidence
and argument in

FRENCH REPUBLICAN FREEDOM.
Passports have been re-established by the Versailles Government
in France. The Palace of Versailles was once the abode of Tyranny.
Now it is Liberty Hall. Should M. Thiers and his colleagues be
ousted and replaced by the Commune, what' further advance is
likely to be made in
French liberty? If
these things, that is
to say, restored Pass-
ports, are done by
the Tricoloured Re-
public, what will be
done by the Red'?
Perhaps ultra-demo-
cratic French Rulers
will take so forward
a step in the direc-
tion of Freedom as
to close the taverns
and restaurants
against excursionists
on Sundays.

mind is
by the
of his

affairs in his absence
going to ruin, or whilst he is desiring with all his heart to be else-
where, and wishing Tichborne v. Tichborne at the Head Quarters
of the Inns of Court Volunteers?
Yet the Legislature has preferred the method of procuring
unwilling Special Jurors by coercion. Behold, small boys, with how
little wisdom Acts of Parliament are made.
Dissenters of the
Future.
The final decision
of the Privy Council
in the Purchas Case
will, if enforced, the
Ritualists declare,
occasion them to join
the Dissenters in
their demand for the
disestablishment of
the National Church.
In the meantime
the Jiock tells us
that :—
"A congregation of
Dissenters at Wimble-
don, numbering be-
tween 400 and 500, are
about to join the Church
of England. The trus-
tees will open their
chapel as a church, and
the Bishop op London
will license tho same."
Now that the
Church by Law Es-
tablished has been
legally pronounced a
Protestant Church,
Dissenters, we see,
begin to walk in.
Perhaps we shall see
the Ritualists, on the
other hand, begin to
walk out, and both
sides go on till they
have changed their
relative positions.
In that case the Ri-
tualists will not have
joined the Dissenters,
but will simply have
taken their place.
That will differ from
their present situa-
tion in this, that
when they are there,
they will be "just,"
as Sawney says,
Dissenters out of the
Church instead of
in it.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

N Monday, May 15,
the British Parlia-
ment, which does
not always display
a fine sense of the
fitness of thing's, did
this week behave
itself with a good
sense which entitles
it to Mr. Punch's
praise. Aware that
in the following
week the Public
Mind would muchly
be turned in a Spor-
tive Direction, and
that Mr, Punch
would condescend to
adapt himself to
circumstances, the
Houses passed unani -
mous mental resolu-
tions not to say or
do anything which
should compel Mr.
Punch to notice
Parliament at any
length. Westminster
- gracefully gives the
(not paw, stupid)
Meeting the Houses
in the same spirit.
Mr. Punch will
therefore merely re-
gister the fact, that
on Monday there was a very useless discussion in the Lords on the Black Sea
Treaty, but Lord Salisbury enlivened it by likening Lord Granville to Caleb
Balderstone, and comparing his satisfaction with having obtained Russia's
condemnation of the repudiation of a treaty, while she obtained all her ends, to
the self-gratulation of a man who had been robbed by a highwayman, but did
not care, because he had made the thief recite the Eighth Commandment. In
the House of Commons there was fresh resistance to the Money Scheme, and
Mr. Muntz was defeated by 260 to 195.
Tuesday. The Bill for giving mercantile folks a few more holidays—they will
have Six in all—went through Committee in the Lords. The Scotch Lords were
quite indignant at the idea of Whit Monday being made a holiday in Scotland.
The Duxe of Argyll said that no Scot kept it unless he had been contaminated
by English influences.
The Westmeath Outrages Bill was debated in the Commons, and some Irish
Members deprecated it, as, of course, they were bound to do, and as equally, of
course, they could do with perfect patriotism, inasmuch as their opposition
could not hinder a useful measure.
To-day the Republican rabble in Paris pulled down the Vendome Column.
Wednesday. Stop, all ye at Epsom, or on the road, who are about to raise the
goblet to your lips. Listen! A Bill for enabling a man who does not like the
liquor in your hand to dash the vessel away, was debated, and rejeoted by 206
to 124. If the Bungs had not been so insolent to Members about the Licensing
Bill, the minority would not have been so large, but gentlemen do not like to be
threatened by publicans.
Thursday. The British LordB observed Ascension Day. In Paris, the women
who resorted to the churches were turned out by the Republicans, and the
priests were made to close the doors.
Mr. Disraeli delivered a long and not unamusing speech against Mr. Lowe
and his Budget. But it takes two to make a fight, ana either Mr. Lowe did
not think it worth while to cross swords, or his noble spirit of sarcasm had been
damped by recent events, for he answered very shortly, and affected to treat
the attack as a practical joke. Mr. Punch was so offended at being baulked of
his expected fun, that he left the House, and declared tiuit he would not return
till after the Derby.
A DOLE, INDEED.
The Times quotes from the Winchester Observer the legend, well known
in Hampshire, of " The Tichborne Dole." The prophecy therein preserved has,
like many other predictions, been partly verified but not quite. The " Tich-
borne Dole" (of bread) was discontinued in 1793; nevertheless, there remains
one heir male, at least, to the Tichborne estates, to whomsoever of two claimants
the Court of Common Pleas shall award that property. A Dole of a different
■sort from the one founded by the Lady Mabella Tichborne in Henry the
Second's reign, is the suit now pending before Judge Bovnx. The Tichborne
Dole of these days is that most doleful affair for the ancient House affected by
!i the case of Tichborne v. Tichborne.

LA.W v. LAWSON.
"Save us from reign of the Ladies!"
.Mankind is praying in awe:
And no wonder John Bull thus afraid is,
Seeing what last week he saw—
How stubborn the will of a maid is,
At least when her name is Law!
6m Wilfrid Lawson and party
In the Hall of St. James were met,
Permissive-Bill-partisans hearty;
United to overset,
From Cornwall to Cromarty,
The reign of heavy-wet.
To empower the publio that won't drink
To muzzle the publio that will;
And instead of arguing, " Don't Drink,
Because it will make yon ill"
To shut taps in their faces that want drink,
Reducing their will to nil.
The platform they wagged their jaws on;
Smoothly the meeting sped,
And to resolution draws on,
To be voted—nem. con.—as read.
When Miss Law on Sir Wilfrid Lawson,
Falls like a hundred o' lead.
With a hostile resolution
On the meeting down she came:
And with feminine elocution
She did enforoe the same:
'Twas Giant to Lilliputian,
Wild woman to Baronet tame!
She gave it Sir Wilfrid Lawson
And his Permissive Bill:
Laid her nails each weak clause on,
For Liberty quoted Mill,
Swept reasons aside, as straws on
A flood are whirled at will.
The meeting awhile sat silent,
So taken aback were all;
But, shortly, growing vi'lent,"
They began to hiss and bawl,
But Miss Law, with a lady-like smile,.leant
Her back against the wall.
And the more the meeting clamoured,
The more she didn't care;
When with hands and heels they hammered,"
She stopped, her breath to spare.
But neither shrunk nor stammered
That woman small and spare!
Till all their clamour idle,
These men forced to confess,
The Law they could not bridle,
Determined to suppress.
So up to her managed to sidle,
And seized her by the dress.
But the harder they tugged, the bolder
Her crowding foes she faced.
They might cateh her o'er the shoulder,
Might take her round the waist,
The more they tried to hold her,
The less she would be embraced.
0! mighty was the bustle
Of battle Miss Harriet about,
And terrible the tussle
'Ere Law could be turned out—!
That woman of more than muscle,
Stout champion of Stout.
But if one maid, single-handed,
Can of men thus face a hall,
When their Bex comes to be banded,
Ours must before them fall,
Lords of Creation Btranded—
Creation's Laws o'er all!
And Sir Wilfrid Lawson, should draw
From the case a warning clear:
That Permissive Bills, their claw
May sheathe this many a year:
'Tis no joke to oust the Law
That guards the poor man's beer.

THE FRENCH ACTOR-SWINDLE EXPOSED.
(By a British Veteran.)
Mb. Punch, Sib,
Ha vino long had dinned into my ears by our critical
gentlemen of the Press, the immense superiority of French oyer
English acting—and I may remark, by the way, that I don't think
that the constant sneering and sarcasm at native talent is exactly
the sort of thing " to bring the violets from under the leaves," as my
amiable friend Fitz-Ball once remarked to your caustic contributor
Jebrold—I have lately been a regular attendant (with orders) at
the Opera Comique. Though classically and expensively educated, I
cannot say that I possess that acquaintance with the French lan-
guage—as spoken—which would enable me to follow French dramatic
dialogue—word by word, that is. Happily, however, my familiarity
with our own dramatio repertoire has pretty well initiated me
into most of the stock pieces on the French boards. As the Oxford
undergraduate said, when asked how he had managed his Greek
Testament in the Little-go, that he had gone in trusting to his
knowledge of the original, so I may say of the French plays, one
can always fall back on one's knowledge of the original—in English.
Besides, Sir, as a veteran performer, I do not require a knowledge
of the words to enable me to pronounce on the merits of the acting.
There is a style, Sir: a mastery of the resources of our difficult
and thankless art; a way of treading the stage; a secret of getting
the most out of a point, a bit of business, or a situation, which pro-
claims the actor far more palpably than such secondary matters as
propriety of pronunciation, correctness of emphasis, music of decla-
mation, or the suiting of voice or delivery to character. All that is
plain sailing—the A B C of our craft. Far beyond it lie the arcana,
the Masonic mysteries, or esoteric doctrines of the dramatic art. It
is mastery of these that makes the essence of acting, as I humbly
conceive it.
Of such mastery I was sorry, but not surprised, to find scarcely
a trace among the actors of the Theatre Francais—great as their
reputation may be in France, and echoed and exaggerated as French
admiration may be by venal and malignant critics on our own Press.
That they are venal, I know, for I have given them nothing, and
what is the consequence f That not one of them devoted so much as
a paragraph to my Hamlet when I played it at my complimentary
henefit at the Wells, last year, or my Lear at the Royal Hoxton,
which had an uninterrupted run of three nights, during the present
season.
Will it be believed, Sir, that I did not see in one of these much-
vaunted French performers the least knowledge of how to get
the most out of an exit, or the slightest power of making a point.
Their stylo of delivery was tame and level—little above natural
pitch—no music, no display of vocal resources, none of that playing
on the voice as on an instrument, which is one of the crowning
achievements of our craft. Their way of walking the stage was
undignified, and unimpressive, in fact scarcely to be distinguished
from the movement of people in ordinary life. Their low-comedy
man missed no end of laughs, by want of all power, apparently, of
what in the playful phraseology of our calling, tee call sticking it
into 'em ;" and I saw at least six palpable opportunities of making
a brilliant point, and bringing down the house to a dead certainty,
missed by the obtuseneas or incapacity of the leading man. In a
word, Sir, I never saw so many bits of fat so shamefully thrown
away by the rawest tyros in a country theatre.
I must say, however, that their dramatists are almost as much to
blame for this as their actors. The scenes I saw were rarely worked
up to what I should call a climax; exit speeches seemedt as a rule,
wanting. Even the Act often ended quite flatly and quietly; and
the drop hardly fell once upon a tableau. I saw then how much
many of our pieces adapted from the French owe to their English
adapters. The adaptation has often a richness and fulness of stage
effect, of which only the hint appeared in the French work. In
short, Sir, the whole performance struck me as "stale, flat, and
unprofitable" to a British actor. I would engage to teach any
performer I saw any number of dodges for bringing down the house.
I flatter myself I saw none of them who could teach me anything.
Besides, Sir, I observed, as might be expected, a grievous want of
that self-respect, that recognition of what a man owes to theatrical
position, to say nothingof personal dignity, which, I am happy to Bay,
still characterises the British actor. I actually saw a M. Delaunay,
who, I am told, is the leading juvenile man of the company, going
on in livery to carry a message! May the day be far distant when
a British leading-man stoops to such degradation!
Like most things French, Sir, depend upon it, French acting is a
swindle, and all the puffing of it in our Press, prejudice. To sum
up all my objections to it in one word, it is un-English in the
highest degree.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PERCY AND THE DERBY.

In one of Shaxsfeabe's historical plays (The First Part of Henry
the Fourth, sporting friends), Henry Percy, Junior, surnamed
Hotspur, because he was a dashing rider, observe, makes a declara-
tion which may give you some idea of his horsemanship. He says,
on an occasion:—
"Br heaven, methinka it were an easy leap
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon."
That was Hotspur's notion of an easy leap. You will own that it
was highly creditable to him, or to Shakspeare who makes him
state it. But in the days of Shaksfeare the Derby was not yet.
If it had been, the Swan of Avon (Shakspeabe, so called because he
belonged to Stratford-on-Avon, and there were swans in that river,
and Poets are otherwise called Swans because Poetry is also called
Song, and Swans were supposed by the Ancients, who knew no
better, to sing)—this Swan, who at least you know was no Goose,
would no doubt have amended one of the above-quoted lines.
Instead of swearing that he thought it an easy leap
"To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon"
(and what a horse Percy must have had, as well as what a rider he
must have been, to do that!) Hotspur would assuredly have been
made by Shajcspeabe, duly considering the great annual event at
Epsom, to substitute for his instance of the leap which he professed
himself to account easy, this modification of it:—
"To pluck the Turf's Blue Kiband from the sky."
This alteration would have been a great improvement—wouldn't
it?
MY HEALTH.
Budd and myself, take notice of the miscellaneous procession of
dogs behind My Aunt, as we commence our descent, Budd trying
to admonish Growler with a gentle kick, that he (Growler) is not to
join the performing canine troupe now following my relative.
More Regular Mechanical Figures.—On the East Cliff appears
the Pensive and Mysterious Lady in black, taking short walks up
and down, and occasional "sits;" also the Croquet-playing Family
who contest vague and unexciting games, within the garden-rails, in
any weather. The Foreigner of unwashed aspect, who, for economy's

to be ready for to-morrow's use on the same principle. Perhaps he
is breaking himself of the habit.
We pass these on our road to the Cramville. On the Cliff the men
are engaged on a work of a very perilous nature, which is nothing
less than hacking away the Clifl itself and seeing how small a space
each man can stand upon without falling over. The Secretary is
here, and tolls us about the Verandah which, owing to him, was built
j in a fortnight; which fact he can't get over anyhow. He lights his
pipe and stands in front of the hotel, admiring that Verandah, as if
he personally had put it up all himself, painted it, varnished it, made
the iron-work, fitted it up and come down again without any sort of
aid or assistance.
Budd asks if Samuel, the Bathman, is in, as he and his friend
(I'm his friend) wish to commit the enormity of a wash.
The Secretary thinks it not unlikely that Samuel is there, it being
Samuel's duty to be there, but he won't commit himself to hnoiciug
anything about it for certain - he may be or he may not (all this
time he can't take his eyes off the Verandah, as if he still saw where
some improvement might come in, with perhaps just a dash of paint,
put on in a moment of inspiration) but on the whole inclines to the
opinion that Samuel is there.
Is there a table d'hote to-day ? we inquire. After half a minute's
thought just to clear his head of the Verandah, and get the fresh
subject in, the Secretary replies, that "there it a table d'hote, 0
yes, certainly;" (and conclusively, now that the Verandah has quite
gone out and he has grasped the subject)—"yes, a table dhote at
half-past six."
"\ou have a good chef here," we observe, Budd or myself, or
both.
"Yes," returns the Secretary, refilling his pipe and speaking with
rather a doubtful air. as if he couldn't quite give his opinion of the
chef until he's tried him with everything, Yes," he admits, "he's
not bad," and lights his pipe.
"Will the table be very full to-night F" is my next question.
The Secretary thinks it may be, perhaps, but is generally un-
interested—except, as his eyes wander upward once more to the
Verandah. So we leave him, and enter the Cramville, where
the Turkish Bath is.
[By the way, everything appears to be obtainable at the Cramville.
Do you want billiards P—there you are in the Japanese Gothic room
with a Phenomenon boy-marker, the Pocket Roberts. Do you want
American billiards ?—there you are again, with a blue ball and no
extra charge. Can't you get on without a sulphur bath P—there you
are, or there you will be, when the sulphur comes, the baths being
there now. Do you want to smoke at the top of the house, like a
chimney ?—there you are, with a flag flying from that part of the
roof, to announce your presence. Do you want to dine alone ?—do
it, in the coffee-room. Do you want to dine in company ?—do it
again, in the salle-d-manger. Do you want to read or write? or
play bowls? or play croquet? or be quiet? or have your hair
brushed P—there you are. Do you want a concert after dinner P—
there's the concert-room and the music-stands. Do you want a
dramatic entertainment P—yes P Very well, then there's a stage,
with scenery, lights, and curtain, at the end of the ooncert-room.
This stage, 1 am informed, was "inaugurated" by an Eminent
Entertainist, who, at the end of his performance, took off his wig
as a mark of respect to the National Anthem, which he sang by
way of carrying out the idea of inauguration. Perhaps he muddled
the notion with some reminiscence of "unveiling a statue."]
Budd, followed by the brown-bear dog Growler, walks down a
passage, and shouts Samuel!"
A voice is heard in the distance, which Budd tells me belongs to
Samuel, the black man, manager of the Turkish Baths, and sham-
pooer in ordinary to anyone who comes to be shampooed.
We open the door of the first room, and Samuel stands before us.
He is a tall coloured gentleman, of the handsomest darkest mahogany
dye, dressed in a loose suit of (apparently) red check bed-curtains.
He is enthusiastic about the efficacy of the Turkish Bath system in
all cases and for everybody, no matter who they are, or what's the
matter with them.
Budd introduces me to Samuel, observing that I 've " come to pull
a little flesh off." Whereupon, Samuel, eyeing me all over,puts bis
head rather on one side, opens his eyes wide, stretches out his hands
in a sort of appealing way, and answers, "Well, he can't"—("a"
not being pronounced as or, but a very broad a)—"he enn't do
better dan come here to Samuel" (meaning himself). I '11 bring
him back to Naytehar "—(meaning "Nature ")— and when he"
—(meaning me)— when he leave me he shall say, '1 'm very much
obliged to Samuel.' Dat's it, Sar."
[ What astonishes me, being accustomed to the conventional Christy,
or street-nigger, is, that Samuel shows no sign of joyously giving
way to a break-down dance, or bursting out with a Yah, yah!
nor is his conversation broken up into conundrums.]
Budd laughs, and observes that Samuel will soon put me "in
proper form, and asks him if he doesn't think I want it.
Samuel pretends to be astonished at the question. "Want it!"
he exclaims. "Want it! Of c«rse he want it! Why—look'yar"
—(touching my arms and then my sides, as if explaining me ana-
tomically to Budd)—"look'yar—and look'yar—'tain't Naytehar—
you don t want all dis "—(alluding to what he considers to be super-
fluous flesh). "Of carse," he continues, "you 're ill: of carse: if
you've got all dat about you,"—(here he stretches out his hands on
either side, appealing!/ as before)—" how can you be well?"
This is exactly what has struck me.

CHARTVAEI.

PUNCH'S DERBY PROPHECY.
he people of Thessaly
were the earliest
horse-breakers found
among the Greeks.
Hence the fable
about Centaurs hav-
ing been the abo-
riginal Thessalians.
Thessaly was in
Greece, and perhaps
may be there now.
It was settled by the
JEolian Pelasgi, or
"vain Pelagians,"
who invented .So-
lianharps, now,lam
happy to say, gone
out of use, for more
melancholy noises
than they used to
make in the win-
dows at which they
were fixed I never
heard, and besides
they let in a draught.
I always Bneeze when
I hear an JJolian
harp even mentioned.
This is a curious fact. There is another thing about the Thessalians. Mr. H azlitt, the
excellent Registrar in Bankruptcy, says that they were noted, not only as horse-tamers,
but for their skill in the preparation of poisonous drugs. The art of drugging horses
therefore naturally arose with racing. This is another curious fact.
Solomon kept forty thousand horses, and I should think it would havo taken all his
wisdom to manage such a stud without coming to grief. Most persons who keep many
horses are not Solomons, quite the contrary, though they have generally to apply to
persons of the race to which that sovereign appertained. They make such applications
until these are unfavourably received, and then Mb. Hazlitt, above-mentioned, hears
about it. In the ninth century horses were shod only in frost, at other times they said
(well, Xanthus spoke to Achilles, now then,) in the words of the Yankee song, " Shoe,
fly, don't come anear me." William the Conqueror, son of Arlotta, daughter of the
Skinner at Folate, introduced shoeing into England, but not such shoes as might have
been made out of his grandfather's skins, though this would have been a delicate family
attention, but horse-shoes, made of iron, on which there has not been the least improve-
ment since the time of the Conquest. But this is not relevant to the Derby, because
racers wear plates, and sometimes win them. What says Cowper about Englishmen
riding races in France?
"Be jockeys now, and win a plate
Where once your nobler fathers won a crown."
Sold, my generous patrons, sold) Not so, my generous patrons, but Mr. Punch
writes for all sorts and conditions of men and women, and it is necessary that he should
have matter to suit all tastes. Hence, though all his epigrams sparkle like dew-drops in
the May morning, some are of milder effulgence than others. Hence he occasionally
flourishes his glittering blade with somewhat of ostentation, at other times he strikes
silently and home, like the Corsair's men when the Turks were polishing them off. But
have faith in him, and you will be all right. The information in the above paragraphs
may not be apparently useful as a direction to you how to bet upon the Derby for 1871,
but it will be interesting to myriads, and it is ten million times more valuable than
anything that will appear in any other article on the Race.
Besides, I may obsecvo that I hod a good mind not to give any Prophecy at all. I have
patronised every Derby since Whisker's year, inclusive, and I never knew a year in which
so little interest seems to be taken about Epsom. None of your bosh and impertinence
about my being older than I was, and caring less about races. I am younger than I ever
was, and I am perfectly frantic with joy at the thought of mounting that Derby drag,
chaffing my accomplices, and gaily sending up my first smoke-whiff into the sweet morning
air. Time has not thinned my raving hair (nor has my hair-dresser, lately) and if
there be a few streaks of silver in it, they typify the sparkling fountains of my well-pre-
served heart. Not care for the Derby! I live for it. 'Tia my one day of the year. My
grievance is that other people have come to care so little about it. I fancy the coves who
write about it have done the thing to death, and bored people into voting it a nuisance.
I wish it could go, for a couple of years, undescribed in a graphic manner.
But you will say, "Proceed, sweet warbler, your tale interests me." I am not a sweet
warbler, and I remark, with Rabelais, that I do not care whether my tale interests you or
not (he did not say it, but only something like it, but I tell you what he did say, namely,
that Paris has always been a most disturbed, impertinent, audacious city, and that any
good Ring of France would keep it in subjection), but I proceed. Tou respectfully offer
me a list of the horses that ore to run for the Derby, and you request me to name the
winner. The cheek of the Pensive Public is one of those things for which there is no
word but the Young Lady's only adjective—awful. This, by the way, Shaksfbarb uses
in the sense of obedient, or having due regard for authority, which every young lady
is, or has. Otherwise, it means solemn, august, venerable,
dreadful, fearful, terrible, and therefore is exquisitely appli-
cable on most occasions when it is used by the Fair Sex. You
see, I know how to blend instruction with facetiousness.
Among the horses I perceive Albert Victor, and I am pleased
with the compliment imported by his nomination (sporting gents
will notice that I do not use this last word in the only way they
understand), but he might have been called Christian Edward
also, because then he would have been shod all round. For as
you know a horse is, as the schoolboy said, a beast with four
legs, one at each comer. Tho Zephyr colt has, on the other
hand, No Name, but if he is such a success as my friend
Wilkib Collins's book, so entitled, he will make a name for
himself. There is a pretty classical story about the colts with
atmospherio pedigrees, but I cannot stop to tell it now. Who
was the King of the Forest t Was it the Cedar of Lebanon, or
a bramble? name from the Saxon brembel. It could not have
been the latter, because there were no Saxons in the days when
the trees of the forest desired a king. And yet I do not know.
What says the German poet?—
"Child of the earth, leave the fools to their foolishness,
Berries were bitter in forests of yore."
To be sure there were other berries than blackberries, with which
the pretty lips of the Children in the Wood were all besmeared
and dyed, dear little pigs. Let us pass on from this mystery to
Grand Coup. There will be a grand cooing of Pigeons (turf
dupes, my dear) if he wins, but if he does not win, they will
be Pouters. I have Divers reasons (d'ye mark) for thinking well
of the Pearl, and I advise you to turn to the chapter in Lothair
about pearls, for you will there find something which will repay
your trouble. As regards the Count, I do not advise you to count
your chickens before they are hatched, or you may have to hang
up your Hatchment (as the uneducated coll it) for the demise of
your hopes; nevertheless Count is no counter-jumper. Digby
Grand is a horse with a name that sounds "winning." I go so
far as to say that he will be somewhere on the race-day.
Ravenshoe is named from another delightful book,by my friend,
Henry Rinqsley, but I fancy sporting men call him Raven
Shoe, and think the name has something to do with his plates,
which may be blacked, like shoes and ravens. "Hoe," how-
ever, is from the Saxon for a hill, and you might say Primrosehoc,
if you like, there's no charge.
As for Ripponden, you know den is dean, a valley, the right of
hog-feeding wherein is called denbera. Rippon, or Ripon, is a
place in Yorkshire, which has also a Dean, and he is not a volet,
but an out-and-out good priest, and I hope that he will excuse
me for edifying my flock by mention of his merits on this secular
a.-ioii. Ripon was famous for its manufacture of spurs, and
of saddle-trees—good omens. Like a washhundbasin, it is placed
near the Ure. Combine this information, and bet accordingly.
We next come to Noblesse. The French say noblesse oblige; and
if this animal will oblige backers by winning, I daresay they
will be very glad; but it must be very distasteful to her ladyship
to hear the sporting gentlemen speak of Aoi-less, us that pre-
sumes that tho bearer of the name can't win by a head. As for
the Frolic colt, another of the anonymous quadrupeds, "frolic"
comes from the German frolich, and everything German is in
great luck just now; whereas General, being marked thus,
General, and pronounced in the dictionary (and no where else)
h/ai-nai-ral, is French, and but I abstain from drawing an
inference which might annoy a single (or married) member of
a noble nation. The remark which I have made about German
luck applies still more potentially and subjunctively to King
William. "What can he do that cometh after the king?"
Well, he can kick him; and a great many of the kings of the
earth (in other days) would have been all the better for such a
memorandum that they were earthy. But in this case a good
Sovereign's name is given to an animal, that if he wins the race
will not do it by imitating his namesake, for when did brave
Emperor William run? What shall be said of Fisherman f
I have seen a horse of that name, a dear old bird, win many a
race, and I have pocketed Her Majesty's coinage in consequence,
and the name is beloved of this child. But, ahem! if my friend
the Pope will excuse me, and I know he will, the Successor to
the Fisherman has not been so wonderfully fortunate of late.
Still, if you go down on a drag, and draw Fisherman in a sweep,
you will get something, if it is only the little piece of paper on
which his name is written, and that will be a great comfort to
you and your family, to whom I wish all happiness.
Lastly, I come to Bothwell. Not the place itself, understand,
which is on the east bank of the Clyde, between Hamilton (not
Hamilton's Bawn; that is, or wae, in Ireland) and Glasgow (in

Scotland), and is known as the scene of a battle between the Covenanters and
the Royalists in 1679, when the former were defeated by the Duke of
Monmouth.. Still less (if there can. be lesj than not doing a thing) do I come
to Bothwell, who was tried for complicity, in the murder of Mary Queen
op Scots' husband Darnley (or the Field of the Cloth of Gold), and some-
how acquitted. He, however, ran with the utmost speed when the Scottish
nobles rose (like rose-nobles); and if his namesake imitates him, why the
horse that wins must be a clinking good one. Why clinking, I have no idea,
aa that means "making a small sharp sound," but it seemB knowing and
horsey to use slang, however idiotic. Bothwell was the Favourite of poor
Queen Mary. But he used her very ill. I do not believe in the doctrine
of metempsychosis to the extent of thinking that he has passed into the body
of the Derby Favourite, or I should certainly do what he did to Darnley,
namely, blow him up.

"It is affirmed (says the Echo) that a Parisian gentleman has offered

be in a position to claim the money. If not, a German General is
thought to have a good chance.

Farewell, my five shillings—farewell, my " caroon,"

To take part in a Sweep—but I went in to lose.
Farewell, my five shillings—no ruinous loss,
Such as sporting men risk when they back that 'ere 'oss."
I can praetise economy, clip, shave, and pare,
And contrive by retrenchment the money to spare.
Farewell, my five shillings—new boots I '11 postpone,
I will wear the hat quite out that seedy has grown.
On a chop, for awhile, I'll continue to dine,
And I '11 substitute beer with my dinner for wine.
Farewell, my five shillings—enough on a Race
Thrown away, but the money no need to replace
Will us losers to steal or embezzle impel—
Can you all say as much? My five shillings, farewell.

A good name for a promising foal was suggested during the late

when he had a cold in the head. He remarked that the Horse was a

ANGELS AS MINISTERS.
(From a Parliamentary Report of the Future.)
HOUSE OF COMMONS.—Monday.
Questions.
Mb. Disraeli, seeing the First Lady of the Admiralty in her place, begged
leave to ask when the trial trip of the new iron-clad, the Calceolaria, was to
take place.
Ladt Yachttngton begged he wouldn't talk about such a thing. It must
come off, she supposed, but the sea made her so awfully ill that she hoped she
might hear nothing more on the subject till the time arrived. (Cheers.)
Sir John Pakington, aocording to notice, wished to ask the Home Secre-
taress why a pardon had been granted to Jasper Montgomery Montmorency,
sentenced for a savage assault.
Mrs. Overcoddle said that the Hon. Member for Droitwich was a stern man,
and it was the belief of the Government that offenders might be treated in
better ways than by sternness. Poor Montmorency had said that he was quite
sorry for his outbreak of passion, and had promised to do something, one of these
days, if pardoned, for the man he had disabled, who was a very ugly little
wretch, and had probably aggravated poor Mr. Montmorency into a rage.
Lord John Manners wished to ask the 8ecretaress-at-War when the 199th
Dragoons were to sail for India.
Lady Beuona Jones said that they would embark when the weather was
a little cooler. Surely the noble Lord did not think that they were to be sent
while the heat made it quite disagreeable even to drive out except in the
evening. It was true that the Governor-General had telegraphed for them,
but he must wait. She had no doubt that he had got soldiers enough, if he knew
how to use them properly.
Mr. Walpole asked the Post-Mistress General whether anything was going
to be done for the relief of the over-worked letter Carriers P
Mrs. Scribbleton said that they were not over-worked,
but some people were always getting up a grievance.
What weight had they to carry? Why, a bundle of
letters that a schoolboy would toss in one hand. What
was healthier than exercise in the open air. Of course
they were out in all weathers, but so were the policemen.
She had no patience with effeminacy. Her own boys
at Eton got wet through twice in one day last week, and
made no fuss. (Cheers.)
Mr. Henley wished to learn from the law-officers of
the Crown whether they intended to introduce a Bill
to amend the Law of Divorce.
The Solicitress-General said that the subject was
a delicate one for treatment by the present Government,
and that they hoped the good taste of the House would
spare them the necessity of dealing with such a topic.
She believed that she was addressing an assembly in
which there were many gentlemen. (Cheers.)
Mr. Lowe inquired whether anything was to be done
about a Decimal Coinage.
The Mistress of the Mint said, with some asperity,
that easier reckoning was wanted only by stupid people
who could not learn the multiplication table. Pounds,
shillings, pence, and farthings had done very well for
many thousands of years. Besides, all the poor little
children in the schools had been taught the old tables,
and she would be no party to tormenting them with new-
ones. If the Hon. Member for Cable liked to go to
France, he could get francs and centipedes, and frogs
into the bargain. (Great laughter.)
Mr. Cowper-Temple wished to know the inten-
tions of the Government in regard to public recreation
of the Exchequer said that she
must answer that, as the question was really one of
finance. Government felt that there ought to be more
Farks. But money must first be had. They intended
to sell the stuffy old British Museum, for which nobody
cared except old twaddles, and with the price of the
place, and the collections, and ridiculous old books, they
meant to buy and lay out a beautiful Park within easy
carriage-drive of the West End.
Sir Roundeli, Palmer desired to know whether
Brady and Tate's doggerel psalms were to be removed
from the Prayer-Book.
Miss Phylactery (Under Home Secretaress), appealed
to the House whether any Honourable Member, especially
the editor of the Book of Praise, ought to speak of the
Prayer-Book in that athestic manner. The Honourable
Member need not go where that version was used. There
were plenty of churches where they sang Hymns Ancient
and Modem. Besides, thousands of beautifully-bound
Prayer-Books had been given as presents, and were all
these to be made waste paper of?
Lord Milton would ask the Foreign Secretaress what
was our present attitude in regard to the United States.
Mrs. De Charade (with her admirable Yankee imita-
tion, so well known in private theatricals) said she was
obligated to own up that the Yankees had been trying to
snarl our yarn, and had sent over a diplomatic cuss with
no more manners than a Bar, (to the Speaker, Yes, Sir)
but as soon us she had taken one single squinny at him,
she guessed he'd have a bad time, and just this very
now he was gittin' that same. (Shouts of laughter, and
cries of" Encore.")
The House then adjourned, as the Prmmiehs had a
delightful Garden Party.
Pound Away at Him 1
Ascot St. Leger who, as a racing man, oan talk in
no other terms at the present time than those of the turf,
says that he thinks a Grand Stand ought to be made
against any further addition to the Income-tax. As it
is, he feels himself to be too heavJy weighted, and
wishes Mb.. Lowe would put the saddle on the right
horse.
A Fiery Steed.
Among the Quorn hunters sold the other day an animal
described as " one of the best-looking horses in the stud"
fetched 210 guineas. The name of this horse was Comet.
We regret not to be enabled to state the length of
Comet's tail.

A DREAM OE A DRY SUNDAY.
When leaves be green, and flowers be gay,
And skies be bright and blue,
A good place for a stroll on a summer's day
Is the Gardens and Grounds at Kew.
A sweaven I had, in the month of June,
Of a holiday full fair;
Of an out on a Sunday afternoon,
And I dreamt that I was there.
The sun, methought, from mine each pore,
Made drops to trickle free;
And all the nothouses the more
Did take it out of me.
The"people all, both high and low,
Were in like case with mine;
The men, each one, and the women also,
That all their cheeks did shine.
He that melteth away in the broiling heat,
As he findeth his strength to sink,
He waxeth heartily fain of meat,
And still more fain of drink.
Good liquor is ever a man's best stay.
What time when his force doth fail;
For a fellow that fainteth by the way—
No physic like right old ale!
For drought I dreamt they all went mad,
Because for ale they lacked;
Sithence that none was to be had,
By a Tavern-closing Act.
They cried, and roared, and raved amain,
And Parliament they cursed,
That had bereft them of their drain,
When they were parched with thirst.
So being mad, what wreck they wrought
To say 'twould not beseem.
Ye Prigs never drive good folk distraught,
As ye did in mine ill dream.

PUNCH'S DERBY PBOPHECY.
There, there, my Pensive! Stow your gratitude. I am accustomed to do
noble and kindly things. In fact I rather like doing them. I hare saved
you from all loss, you say, and I have conferred on you inestimable gain by
my Prophecy last week. Very well, you are thankful, and that is enough.
I might have led you wrong, you observe, for you have child-like (not
childish) faith in me. Of course you have, and your true and dear old Punch
will never betray that faith. All the other Prophets were wrong, you state.
Well, not quite all. My dear and venerable friend Nunquam Dormio winked,
and my very pleasant friend the Meadow was a trifle green. My noble
Sportsman for once aimed badly, and my respected Sporting Life did not look
quite alive enough. My esteemed Sporting Gazette would have put you into
another gazette, if you had betted your all on his surmise. Even my well-
beloved Era did not 'ear a true little bird singing. But they all gave such
good reasons for their beliefs that they all deserved to be right, and my faith
in all of them is exactly as strong as it was before. Only the Sporting Timet
bade you back Zephyr Colt, or Noblesse. I felicitate that prophet on his luck.
He is not at all like a pig, but like a pig he saw the wind, the West Wind.
Yet he could not quite put it into a bag, not being as wise as Ulysses, for
whom, you know, my Pensive, the winds were tied up in sacks, but his
avaricious sailors, thinking there was plunder, let them out, and came to
uncommon grief. Touching the winner of the Derby
"Which I wish to remark,
And my language is plain,"
I said that the Zephyr Colt had, just before the race, No Name, but that if
he were such a success as my friend Wilkie Collins' book, so entitled, he
would make a name for himself. I delicately alluded to a certain classical
story, which is taught to good boys at school, about the ancestry of colts with
atmospheric pedigrees. Well, do you think that I am going to claim that as
a successful prediction? Perish the thought! I could easily prove that my
words clearly meant that Favonius was to win. I could easily prove anything.
But who was Faponius? I turn to Da. William Smith's Smaller Classical
Dictionary (a most useful book for gentlemen who want to be classical in a
hurry), and I find—
"Favonius. An imitator of Cato Uticonsis, whose character and conduct
he copied so servilely as to receive the nick-name of Cato's Ape."
Evidently, my Pensive, this individual has nothing in common with the
winner of the Derby. My dear Pensive, I never prophesied at all. Not at
all, mark you! But I told you, in mystic lines adapted from the great mystic
poet of America, how you should invest. I said—
"Invest in I. v.v. and Ninb."
I might tell you that " I" meant first horse, that " v. v." meant Pest Find,
which is the English of Favonius, and that "Nine" was the number of
Hannah, who won the Oaks. But I scorn such subterfuges.
The fact was that I proposed to you an investment which was certain to re-
pay you a thousand-fold for the paltry sum you would lay out. Happy such
of you as invested as I advised! It does not detract from my wisdom and
goodness that those must have dono so before reading my advice.
For, my beloved and Pensive, turn to my Derby number, and regard the
outside thereof.
There you read, or may read, the words and figures

"Which I wish to remark,
And my language is plain,
That for ways that are dark
And for tricks that are vain,

Which the same I would rise to explain."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[June 3, 1871.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
R. Punch did not
adhere to his re-
solve not to
return to Parlia-
ment until after
the Derby Day.
He could not re-
main sulky in
his tent.
Though raging
still, amid Jus
navy aat
The stem Achilles,
stedfast in his
hate,
Nor mixed in com-
bat, nor in
council joined,
While wasting
cares lay heavy
on his moind,
thehero, Punch,
is east in a more
heroic mould,
and can forgive
those who have
wronged him,
especially when
resentment be-
comes a bore. So
there he was again in his place on Friday, May 19, as ever was.
He looked into the Lords, and heard something about the Natural
History Collection Building at South Kensington. Me. Water-
house is to be the architect, and judging by what Mr. Punch has
seen of that gentleman's work at Manchester and elsewhere, the
business could not be in better hands. By the way, ha! ha! but
we are always so overflowing with wit) would not Me. Watebiiouse
be the party to construct an Aquarium? (" Ever the same mad
wa#-") . ...
We should have taken red ink, typical of blushing, to wnte this
paragraph, but we remembered that our readers would not see it.
They will please to consider Mr. Punch in an advanoed state of
erubescence, and they, that is the British Nation, will hang out the
same token, when the words "Wellington Monument" are read.
We hasten over details. Me. Coleman is to superintend Me.
Stephens, and £9000 more is to be paid, that is, £22,000 in all, and
the monument is to be ready in two years and a half. We shall be
in St. Paul's Cathedral (either having been solemnly deposited there
by an adoring and weeping country, or having walked in, shoving
aside the dirty curtain) on the penultimate Friday of November,
1873, when if the monument be not finished, let those who are con-
cerned Look Out.
There was a debate in the Commons on the Second Reading of the
Westmeath Bill. In fact there were three morning sittings on it.
Out of the 103 Irish Members, only 22 opposed it, and this respect-
able minority quarrelled, and split into three halves, or thereabouts.
But the only speaker Mr. Punch notices is Me. John Mabtin, of
Meath. He was a sort of successor to Joitn Mitchell, and started a
paper called the Irish Felon, but was much too good a fellow for the
work he thought he could do, and he only got a year's imprison-
ment when the retribution came. lie is described as "a decent,
God-fearing Presbyterian," but sticks to his crotchets about an
independent Oireland. He really spoke very well, from his point of
view, and intimated that the Irish had no objection to be ruled by
the Queen, but declared that they would not be ruled by the
English. We rather thought that things were the other way, and
that the 103 Irish Members had a good deal to do with ruling
England—it was certainly so when the last Reform Bill was passed,
and arrangements were made in opposition to the wishes of the
Members tor England. But that's a trifle between friends. The
Bill was read a Second Time by 293 to 11, a previous division giving
its enemies 12, by reason that Alan Plantagenet, Lobd Gablies,
got into the adverse party by mistake. He is son of Lobd Gallo-
way, but to-night showed, that unlike Pistol, he "knew not Gallo-
way nags," and went into the wrong stable. However, like a brave
Plantagenet, he stood up and avowed his error.
Mb. Chadwtck wanted a Committee to consider trie injustice of
the Income-tax, which injustice he ably expounded. Of course
Chancelloe Low-Low made the usual answer, but only got a
majority of 9 against Mb. Ciiadwick. To be sure, there were only
103 Members present, to discuss a matter of so little interest.
Monday. In the Lords there was some talk about the American
Treaty. Mr. Punch saw no reason to object to Lobd Laudebdale's
hope that England had made no "apology." Lobd Geanvtlle
rode away, upon a question of form, from giving explanations.
Lokd Russell olaimed for Parliament, as the Great Council of the
Nation, the right to advise the Crown, and he protested against
ratification of the Treaty until the Houses had been consulted. Mr.
Punch holds himself unfortunate when he differs from (some folks
write " differs with ") the fine Old Whig, but rather thinks that the
Crown, that is the Ministers, are responsible for diplomatic arrange-
ments. So held Loeds Obey and Caibns.
Then, tnrning into the Commons, Mr. Punch heard Mb. Beuce
promise-an early Bill for Regulating Public Houses, and for suspend-
ing any further issue of Licences, and for their better distribution.
This may be called Law for the Bungs of the Future. He also
intimated that the police would be severe against betting houses,
and betting advertisements.- This, when all the Derby books were
pretty well made up, savoured of shutting the door when the steed
wms in the paddook.
Mh. Douglas Straight asked a question about some juveniles who
have been sent to prison for risking their lives to steal spent buUets
at Aldershott. lit appears that the brats give a great deal of
trouble in this way, but whether a sentinel, with a thin cane, might
not do the preventive work, instead of the children being sent to
gaol, is a question that may be asked. The parents, who send their
offspring on such perilous errands, should be got at. Me. Beuce
would not interfere.
The Colonels made fresh attacks on the Purchase Bill. If any-
body doubted its being a rational Bill, that doubt was removed
to-night. Me. Whalley announced that he should give it his
heartiest opposition. Mb. Caedwell warmed up, and let fly at
speakers, wno said the same thing over and over again.
Mb. Bruce has promised a Bill against bringing Dogs into the
Parks. We fear that this is only intended to benefit the riders in
Rotten Row, but if he would exclude the gangs of dogs, chiefly
mongrels for whom hemp should dangle, who are brought to the
water 'in the Parks, and kept yelping and. howling, all the summer
evenings, for the amusement of cads, the pleasures and tranquillity
of these retreats (now perfectly lovely) would be much promoted.
Tuesday. The Germans have behaved admirably in regard to the
English colliers which they sank in the Seine. They instantly dis-
claimed any intention of being rude; they did not ill-treat the
crews; they begged Lobd Granville to put his own price on the
ships, and when ne sent in our bill for £7073, Count Bebnstobff
handed his lordship a cheque for the amount, and thanked him for
taking the trouble of arranging details. This is no time to poke fun
at Frenchmen, or we should ask what they think of the barbarian
Borassians, and also whether they think that any of their own
Governments would have conducted the business so gracefully.
Adjournment for the Derby Day being moved, up rose Me. Thomas
Hughes. He protested against the proposal.
"He had observed since he had been in the Hou9e a disposition to compare
our races to the Isthmian Games. They might as well compare the Grand
Stand with the Parthenon, or 'Dorling's Correct' with a play of J3schti.cs.
At the Isthmian Games all that was the most noble and vigorous in the man-
hood of Greece had met together in competition, the reward of which was a
chaplet of leaves. English races were courses on which all the rascality of
the country was called together—to enter into a competition the reward, of
which was a scramble for pounds, shillings, and pence."
Nevertheless Parliament did adjourn for the Derby Day, and so
did the Court that was trying the Tichbome Case. But the Revisers
of " The Book" sat in their quiet Jerusalem Chamber, and did
pious Work, while all the rest of the world went to Epsom.
The Commons rejected aU Lobd Salisbury's "amendments" to
the University Tests Bill, but, avowedly as a sop to the Lords,
Mr. Gladstone consented to enact that the Colleges should provide
religious instruction for members of the Church, and carried this by
197 to 165. On another division, service in the chapels was com-
manded by 229 to 99.
Perhaps it was felt that Water was not a proper thing to talk
about on a dav when people were packing champagne. Anyhow
the House would not pass a Resolution, moved by Mr. Kay Shuttle-
worth, to the effect that London was not, and ought to be, better
supplied with pure water.
Wednesday. At the Epsom'af ternoon sittings, Baron Rothschild,
M.P., moved that Mr. T. French should take his seat on Favonius.
There was no opposition. Mr. Merby, M.P., then moved that Mb.
Snowden should take his seat on King of the Forest. Agreed.
Mb. H. Chaplin, M.P., moved that Me. Jeffeby should take his
seat on the Pearl. The House of Commons having thus taken its
part in preparing the great spectacle of the day, the other arrange-
ments were made, and the first-mentioned Honourable Member
obtained the Blue Ribbon of the Turf, the second legislator takine
equal honours with a gentleman named Cabtweight, who placed
Mr. Custance on Albert Victor. This is the Parliamentary view of
the business; for the rest, vide Mr. Punch on his Derby Prophecy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
an unrighteous Colonel named Quagg will not easily be forgotten,
sends Mr. Punch a classical memorial of the day: there had been
most atrociously bitter blasts early in the 'week.
'1 Solvitur acris hiems grata vice veris, et lavoni."
"The East Wind, hooray, is as dead as a heifer,
And the Derby was Wn by the West Wind—that's Zephyr."
To which Mr. Punch smilingly adds the next line:—
"Trakuntijut siccas maeliinte carinas."
That is to say—
"The machines (Scotch for carriages) drew ofT the ground;
Not a bottle was then in the boot to be found."
Thursday. The Lords met to hear the Royal Assent given to a
heap of Bills, the Holidays Bill included; so Whit Monday, May 29,
1871, will be memorable as the first festival of the Liberated Clerks.
Then their Lordships liberated themselves until the 5th of June.
But, while England has been enjoying her great holiday, what of
France? Every one oan answer that question. On our Derby Day
the flames of the Tuileries, the Louvre, and other glories of Pans
were ascending, and the miscreants of the Commune were flying
before -the avengers, or falling to their shot and steel. The terrible
record is made here only to explain what occurred next day in the
House of Commons. Siii Robert Peel asked whether the leaders
of Parliament would not express some sympathy with France. Me.
Glabstoite said, and as the words will be historical, let them be
"With, respect to the question of his Right Hon. friend, the Member for
Tunworth, he could not wonder that he had, whether in order or not in order,
under the impression created by events so entirely without any real prece-
dent in-history, been driven or led to any mode of expressing the emotion
whioh-he felt in common with them all. lor his own part, he would not
attempt to characterise by any epithet the circumstances of which they had
obtained a partial knowledge, and he would the rather refrain from it because
In- wns conscious that there were no epithets that could adequately or in any
degree givr satisfaction to the feelings with which ever}' man's mind anil
head-must be oppressed. He did not see at the present moment in what
mannerthe House could advantageously or usefully express an opinion on the
subjeet. :But there was notm Member of the House who, if he saw means of
doing soiuscfully, and of conveying the slightest comfort and solace under
circumstances so extraordinary, would not be most forward to avail them-
selves of it. {Land cheers.)"
Nearly-all the Test of the night was given to the Purchase debates,
and on one division the Government majority had dwindled to 1G in
a House of 324. The riotous cheering of the Colonels' party
testified its joy.
Friday. Lord Elcho received a guarded answer as to the
surrender, by England, of any French insurgents. Their cases will
be considered as they arise. The Westmeath Bill went through
Committee, and the House rose for the holidays.

THE DAY OF WRATH.
It is no vision, this, of opening seals—
Of the snn turned to blackness, as of hair
Of sackcloth, and the moon become as blood—
A heaven rolled like a scroll, an earth that reels—
Captains and Kings, the world's great, rich, and fair,
Calling the rocks to bar the fiery flood
Of His wrath, that, once kindled, who can bear?
But since the Seer of Patmos heard, far-blown,
The trumpet of the voice that bade him write
The things that are, and things that are to be;
And in the spirit saw the heaven-set throne;
And One thereon, 'mid thunderings and light;
And in His hand a book, writ wondrously,
Sealed with the seals of judgment and of might—
Was no more dreadful sight, more awful sound
Than those which we of this time see and hear
Across our guarding moat of silver sea.
A queenly nation in a breath, discrowned,
And hurled by mutual hate, distrust, and fear,
To deeper than the deepest infamy,
Tearing her undressed wounds with maniac cheer,
Clutching her own throat with self-slaughtering hands,
And, in a blatant babble Bedlamite,
Of liberty and love and brotherhood,
Through her fair city flinging fiery brands,
That in her children's blood hiss as they light,
And wrap in flames, not madder than her mood,
Trophies of her old fame and vanished might.
It is as if wrath's vials, seals, and woes
Had all been charged with bitterness afresh
For her who reigned Oueen of Earth's Carnival;
Mistress of amorous arts, seductive shows.
That feed the pride of eye and lust of flesh—
Imperial courtezan, with smiles for all,
And hair that caught souls in its golden mesh.
How she sits desolate—with ashes strewed
Over the glory of that golden hair,
Her bright limbs bleeding, her brave garments torn;
And round her, slain by mutual hands, the brood
She taught sow scoff and doubt, to reap despair,
And, dying, curse the day that they were born,
To see their trusts fail in that fiery air..
Hate armed 'gainst hate, and fear encountering fear:
They whose eyes, set behind, see but the past:
And they, trance-blinded, who no present own,
For all tne stumbling-blocks that it may rear
To trip vain feet, drawn from paths firm and fast,
By mirage of a future, only shown
To vanish—mockery of the desert waste.
Is this woe but for others' warning sent—
That, placid Pharisees, we may stand by,
To preach our skim-milk sermons, and fling stones,
In smug self-righteousness and self-content—
Whose work it is wild notions to decry,
Spread faith in £ s. d., and from dry bones
Draw morals that our practice justify?
Are there no waters out to rot our piles?
No shocks to shake the high-ground of our pride?
No trains laid, no petroleum stored, to burn
Her trophies, who situ crowned Queen of these Isles,
That, like moored argosies, the ocean ride,
Full of wealth, loud with work, from stem to stern,
Tempting the pirates with ill-guarded sides:

Captain, that with his officers must count
Some good, more bad; to quick ohange easy swayed;
More heeding pursers'-books, stores sold and bought,
And how to pare down item and amount,
Than how the crew is drilled, commands obeyed,
And honour reverenced, and honour's fount.
Who can tell when and whence the cry may come,
"The pirates are upon us! Stand to arms I"
And what that cry may find of hidden hate,
Untrusty trusts, and order-givers dumb:

That now smites Franee, and quells her conquering charms!
MY HEALTH.
Sxrix, I am not quite satisfied as to whether a Turkish Bath isn't
a dangerous remedy in this climate, specially to-day, as there's an
east wind. I put this scientifically to Samuel, to show him that
I really am considering the bath medicinally, and have not come
merely to lounge.
Note.—Subsequent experience shows me that Turkish Baths are
generally takenjfor the following reasons:—
1st, Because it passes a couple of hours away easily.
2ndly, Because it gives you an appetite for dinner.
3rdly, Because the taker has felt a little "chippy" (as Budd
calls it) all day and thinks it will set him right.
4thly, Because you 've not taken one before, and want to know
what it's like.
5thly, Because you took one a long time ago, and forget whether
you liked it or not.
6thly, Because the one you had a year since didn't agree with
you, but you rather think it was your fault, so you're
going to give it another chance.
Tthly, Because the one you had the other day didn't do any good,
and you were told that it's the second which is really
beneficial.
Sthly, Because the first Turkish Bath you had agreed with you
wonderfully.
9thly, Beeeas»you ve been saying you '11 take one for the last
two years, and haven't had time.
lOthly, Because you like it.
llthly, Because you don't like it, but think it will do you good.
12thly, Because another fellow takes it regularly, and wants you
to go with him.
13thly, Because your doctor thinks it's a capital thing.
Hthly, Because your doctor says it's the worst thing possible, and
you want to show him he's wrong.
15thly, Because it's a wet day, and you might as well be in a
Turkish Bath as anywhere else—better.
16thly, Because it's a fine day, just the day for a bath.
17thly, Because it's a hot day, and you want to get cool.
18thly, Because it's a cold day, and you want to get hot.
And so on.
I object to the bath to-day, because of the east wind.
"East wind!" repeats Samuel, opening his eyes and mouth, and
stretching out his hands, as if he were playing at fives, and expected
to hit the ball next time. "East wind!! here he half turns away,
chuckles at the absurdity of the idea, and then faces us again.
"What's de east wind? Why—it's de very day to take a bath.'
Dere wouldn't be no test for de bath if it weren't for de east
wind!"
"But," I say, " I may catch cold on leaving, and must wrap up."
Samuel smiles pityingly, and looks from me to Budd, then back
again at me, then once more at Budd. Then he finds words:
Why," he says, almost plaintively, "if you wrap up, what's de
good of coming to me?" This is the first time I've heard anything
like a conundrum from him. "Don't say, if you 're ill afterwards,
it's de bath; don't blame Samuel. No; it's de fault of de wrap-
ping up. Dere, Sar," he adds, with the air of putting a thorough
foser, and settling the question once and for ever, "Look at me J"
do. "Wa-al, where am I all de day?" [Ah! another conun-
drum.] "Ain t I in bath, den out? Do I wrap up?" [These
have been, as it were, a series of conundrums.] Indignantly, " No I"
Pause. Then he calms down, and finishes up withhis usual, " Well,
den, you trust to Samuel (himself) and he see you all right."
[Mem: subsequently. Another day I ask him—" Bad day. Samuel.
for bath, so cold, north wind too." He replies, "Dere! near dat!
Well," as if in utter amazement at the absurdity of my objection,
"Well, I am astonished! An'you an eddicated gen'leman! Why
de north wind!!! Why, it de very day for a Turkish Bath," and
he seems to be so shocked and hurt that one feels compelled to take
a bath in order to console him. But he can't get over it all the time
I'm there, until he's finished with me, and I tell him I feel better,
when he brightens up, and says, 11 Dere! didn't I tell you so. Trust
Samuel, he never tell a lie—it just de very day for a bath." And
so on, whatever the weather may be.]
Samuel retires. We are in a light and airy room of Gothic style,
with a plunge sea-water bath at one side of it under a sky-light.
There are several neat-looking beds, or rather pallets, ranged length-
ways on either side, giving the room a sort of private hospital
appearance, or perhaps (taking the Gothic character into considera-
tion) the innrmatorial department of a somewhat luxurious monas-
tery. The religious tone of the place is heightened by the
introduction of stained glass.'and by the little dressing cabins for the
"plungers," which remind one of the open confessionals seen in
Catholic churches. Quite primitive notion. Confession first, and
baptism by immersion afterwards, with a swim.
Growler has followed Budd into the room, and sulkily takes up
a position under a bed. We prepare for the bath. First stage, the
acrobatic.
Hot Room Number One. Red brick walls. Stained glass windows
of a kaleidoscopic pattern, very dangerous to biliousness and head-
aches. There is a large marble slab, like the front of a fishmonger's
shop, only not sloping on one Bide, where. Budd says, "the patients
can lie." Somehow his use of the word patient' grates upon me.
The marble slab, too, suggests but, no this must be repressed.
I am simply nervous, the effects of my Aunt, Doddbidge, Turtle-
dove, & Co.
I feel that my head is getting hot and dry, and my feet cold. I
mention this to Budd, as an experienced man. He replies, "Ah!
yes! they do sometimes." "But," I ask, "is that rignt? being
anxious. He answers in an off-hand manner (not being the least
nervous or unwell himself), that he doesn't think it matters. It
suddenly occurs to Budd that he oughtn't to have left Growler in
the first room under the bed, because of people coming in.
"Why? what would he do?" I ask, having hitherto looked upon
Growler as harmless, only of a sulky demeanour.
"Why," he answers ruminatingly, "he's inclined to be stupid
with strangers."
I inquire in what way he shows his "stupidity?" It appears, from
Budd's reply, that Growler's " stupidity with strangers developes
itself in a tendency towards strangers' calves. I inquire, in case I
have to go into the room alone, whether there is any chance of
Growler being " stupid" with me.
"Well," Budd says, "in that undress I don't know." He alludes
to my present acrobatic appearance. "He mightn't make you quite
out. Then I won't go in there alone.
"Ho," returns Budd; "I wouldn't, if I were you—better not."
"But," I add, "those sort of dogs are so intelligent; he's seen
me often with you, and he'd probably know my voice."
"Yes," returns Budd, standing in the doorway which leads to
Hotter Room, "he'd know your voice if he could hear it, but the
old boy's as deaf as a posUand, you see, it's that makes him rather
stupid with strangers. With which he disappears into Hot Room,
Number Two.
I am gradually becoming accustomed to the atmosphere: being
"acclimatised," as it were. My hair feels to my touch like grass
after three weeks scorching sun in July. I wish Samuel would
come and watch me to see how I'm getting on. Being all alone is
unpleasant and a trifle dangerous. 1 might frizzle up suddenly or
faint. Budd is, as far as I know, out of call, and I couldn't run
into the hot room for help, which woiJd be out of the frying-pan
(first room) into the fire (second room), and in the only cool room,
where we commenced, is Growler, who, being deaf, won't "quite
make me out," and will probably be " stupid " with me, as a stranger.
Whatever may be the ultimate result, at present I am drying up.
I feel dry all over; parched. I want my pockethandkerchief. It
is in the first room. Let me see, if I go baok into the first room
without medical advice, or Samuel's advice, I may perhaps, get a
chill and send myself all wrong. And again recurs to me—only
more strongly—the just-mentioned want of intellect on the part of
that Beast. On the whole better stay where I am. Why doesn't
Samuel come and see how I am getting on? A novice oughtn't
to be left alone. Supposing I was to faint suddenly, or ...... .
Ah! here is Samuel.
How does he think I am getting on?
He is in ecstasy with my progress. He spreads out his hands and
opens his eyes. 0, beautiful!" he exclaims; "beautiful! dat,"
he says, alludingto my present state, "dat's what I call Naytchar."
So do I to a certain extent. I complain of being dry, generally; of
my hair being dry particularly.
Samuel is quite annoyed; for a few seconds he really can't speak.
He is, apparently, so very much put out by my evident ingratitude
towards Naytchar," and himself.
"Why," he says, when he has recovered himself, "Gracious
Goodness!" rolling his head from side to side, and as usual extend-
ing his hands, palms flat out, like fins, "Ain't dat de verry ting
you come 'ere for? You leave it to me;" then, appealingly, to my

THE SWEETS OF COUNTRY LIFE.
(Depicted by a Man of Feeling.)
'Tis sweet at Summer eve to rove,
When brightly shines each twinkling star,
And, strolling through the silent grove,
Calmly to smoke a good cigar.
'Tis sweet upon the flowery mead
To see the tender lambkins play,
With pensive eye to watch them feed,
And note how plump to roast are they.
'Tis sweet the fallow deer to view,
Couched 'mid the fern in tranquil group;
'Tis sweet to hear the turtle's coo,
And meditate on turtle soup.
'Tis sweet, from cares domestic free,
While wandering by the streamlet's side,
The speckled trout or perch to see,
And think how nice they would be, fried.
'Tis sweet to mark the plover's flight,
Lone on the moor, its nest despoiled;
And with prospective mental sight _
To contemplate its eggs, hard boiled.
'Tis sweet, beside the murmuring rill,
The scented violet to smell;
Yet may a perfume sweeter still
Attend the welcome dinner-bell.

GOOD NEWS.
There seems to be a chance of deliverance from one of our many
bugbears. A notorious tyrant in this way, of long standing and much
pertinacity, is alleged to be a
thorough impostor, nothing
better than a sham. Accord-
ing to an article in the Times:
"The long accepted belief in
the agency of the Gulf Stream,
as a potent carrier of heat from
tropical regions to the North
Western shores of .Europe and
to those of tho United Kingdom,
has been rudely shaken by the
results of the deep sea explora-
tions conducted by Dr. Car-
penter, F.E.8."
We hope rude shaking
will be followed by com-
plete collapse and downfall,
and that the influence of the
Gulf Stream on our afflicted
weather, which always
seemed a most uncalled-for
interference on the part of
a friendly power, and ought
properly to have mingled
itself with the deliberations
of the Joint High Commis-
sion, will never be men-
tioned again, not even in
the utmost stress of con-
versation.
Such a cheering prospect
of relief as this makes one
sanguine, almost hopeful,
that we may live to see the
day when we shall hear the
last of Foreign Invasion,
Exhaustion of Coal, Decline
of England's Power, and
speedy re-establishment of
Popery, with the revival of
the Inquisition as a not
impossible contingency. If,
in addition, De. Living-
stone would only come
back, we might hope to be
comfortable.

DERBY DIVERSION.
TrfE subjoined extract
from a newspaper suggests
a saying which will probably
be applied by certain readers
to the holiday which it con-
cerns :—
"Derby Day at the Poly-
technic — Taking advantago
of the absence of the everyday
crowd of visitors, the Directors
of this institution very kindly
opened its doors yesterday to
admit about five hundred poor
children from the neighbouring
schools, and a considerable
number of girls from an orphan
home at Chelsea."
There are sporting men
who, whilst steadfast in
their own views and prac-
tice of the proper observ-
ance of the Derby Day, are
notwithstanding charitably
tolerant of the opinions and
usage of others. With re-
spect to the course, accord-
ing to the above statement,
pursued by the Polytechnic
Directors on that day, those
liberal sporting men will perhaps be disposed to remark—1
better the day, the better the deed."
The Land of Nod.—The Auction Mart.

HIGHLANDERS AND HORSES.
We read, and are glad to read in the Inverness Courier:—
"The annual sermon against cruelty to animals was delivered in the High
Church on Sunday by the Rev.
Mr. Douglas. The Rev.Gen-
tleman chose for his text Matt,
x., 29, and lucidly pointed out
the sin of cruelty to any of the
lower creation, over whom man
was placed as God's interme-
diary. There was a good attend-
ance, including a few from
other denominations."
Wo trust that the at-
tendance from "other de-
nominations "included sun-
dry heathens, if still extant,
who greatly needed the
lesson. Let Mb.. Douglas's
sermon, in its points, be
printed in a very cheap
form, and given to tourists
in the Highlands. They
will bo kind enough, when
they see any particular bru-
tality used to the horses
that draff vast loads into
the glorious scenery, to
produce tho sermon and
read it out to any coach-
man, guard, or attendant,
who may be doing his best
with whip, stiok, goad, or
other instrument of torture,
to destroy the pleasure
whioh soft-hoartea South-
rons feel in traversing the
superb regions of the north.
Things may have been
changed, or officials may,
but a few years ago Mr.
Punch was kept in a chro-
nic state of rage at the way
horses were treated in the
Highlands. Any remark on
the subject was always met
by the assurance that the
party who had enraged him
was a most respectable man
and a regular communi-
cant, but even this infor-
mation failed to soothe him.
He thanks the Rev. Mk.
Douglas for having opened
the campaign against cru-
elty, and he hopes that va-
rious Highland ministers
will foUow the Inverness
lead.

OUR DEAR WHALLET.
The distinguished Mr. Whaixey has been a good deal "in
evidence" lately, but has not made a pretty figure in the box.
Firstly, he wrote a letter to the Echo, and defended the destruction
of the Vendome Column, pleading that the act was "a peace-
offering to Europe." At this people only laughed.
Secondly, he asked the Government to allow him to assure the
Commune that British influence would be used to obtain an amnesty
for the brutal insurgents and incendiaries of Paris. At this the
House was displeased, and "loud cheers" followed Lord Enpield's
curt reply that we should certainly not interfere.
Thirdly—but let the report speak for itself. The Presbyterian
Church (Ireland) Bill passed through Committee:—
Mr. Whalley objected to the Bill passing through Committee.
Mr. Johnston assured the Hon. Member that there was nothing in the
Bill concerning Jesuits. (Laughter.)
Mr. Whalley said this was not a time of night when he could answer
impertinent observations. (Laughter, and Order /)
Mr. Dodson called the Hon. Member to order, and said he must withdraw
the unusual ohservation. (Hear, hear !)
Mr. Whalley said he meant that the time was not one to answer obser-
vations that were not pertinent to the measure before the House. (Laughter.)
Mr. Dodson: The Hon. Member has explained. (More laughter.)
Peterborough is probably proud of its representative. But it does
not follow that England is proud of Peterborough. However, that is
Peterborough's business. Punch, of course, is thankful for a
Whaixet. Dear old Sibthoej? was never half so amusing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

eksieurs th« Commons To-assembled June 1, but Me.
Gladstone being indisposed, could not attend. So the
proceedings were uninteresting. Yet you will not think
fn when. "Mr. Punch has described them, such is the charm, such the magic
of his variegated narrative.
The Home Secretary promised to go on with the Prayer-Book Bill. "We
strongly advise him to keep his word. There are hundreds of Godfather* in
a most uncomfortable condition. They want the new Prayer-Books, that
they may be elegantly bound, and presented to H. or N. Hundreds of
Mammas, who don't know anything about Parliament, or won't take the
trouble to understand anything about it, are privately setting down these
unfortunate Sponsors as Mean "Wretches (0, ladies can use plain speech
when they like), whereas they are only victims of circumstance. Of course,
the maternal response will be, Who asked them for Prayer-Books? Has
Hancock no cups, or spoon-cum-forks? has Jenner-cum-Rnewstub no
Bags of Bags? has Howell-cttm-James no articles of Virtue, marry-cum-
up? But these questions are beside the question.
Do you know that England has already lent £24,000 to Irish tenants, to
enable them to buy their farms, under the late Land Act? She has, though.
Doubtless this is in some way or other a tyrannical act, an outrage, and an
insult; but Mb. John Martin must explain how it is so. If any lady will
lend us £24,000, she shall be thanked civilly, and shall never hear another
word upon the subject, never.
Ms. Denison perceived a grievance in the existence of Hamilton Gardens.
For the information of the Antipodes, be it said that these are a very small
piece of Hyde Park, enclosed in 1826, and open to anybody who likes to pay
three guineas a-year for a key. Mb. Atbton was quite right in saying that
they form an elegant screen, and the throwing them open would be of
next to no benefit to anybody. So thought 9!) Members against 52. Some-
body will next propose to throw open the Ornamental Enclosure in the
Ttegent's Park, which is the great civiliser and refiner of that part of
London, nn<l whence a much lovelier view is obtained over the water and
towards the woods than you can get at any Scotch lake, only as this one can
be seen for nothing, and without a bothersome journey, foolish people don't
think much about, it. Now, will not a gang of "perfervids scratch
"Cockney " on the margin of this number of Punch f Let 'em scratch, the
prospect can't be scratched away, though their nails were as long as St.
Anthony's in the desert.
We went at the Civil Service Estimates, and there were all sorts of
grumbles and growls. Somebody complained that the mcssenges of the
House were not allowed to bring strangers' cards to the Members. Mb.
Atbton thought the present rule convenient, especially as there were com-
''ons which Members would rather not receive. This little epigram
1 enough, and duns are worse.
Mb. Rylands, whom Mb. Disraeli called the Didactio
Gentleman, objected to the pay of the Foreign Office Mes-
sengers. Now, look here. These must be educated gentle-
men, who have to be trusted with the most awfully im-
portant State papers (documents that might agitate all the
Stocks of Europe, and bring on "Wars and all sorts of com-
motions), and they have to travel night and day, "posters
of the sea and land " as hard as steam or horseflesh can
hurry them. And what is their splendid remuneration?
£400 a year, and a sovereign a day (bagman's pay), for
travelling expenses. This the Didactic thinks too much.
But Lobd Enfield, and others, who knew what they were
talking about, fired up for the Messengers, and no division
was taken.
Discussion on the use of the Lobd Privy Seal. He has
but £2805 a year, and his business is to be the Odd Man of
the Cabinet, to do anything of any sort that he is asked to
do, and to be always ready to advise everybody else. There
be odd men, and odd men, but Punch thinks with Mb.
Sclater Booth that Lord Halifax is uncommonly cheap
ut the price. Punch would give him twice the money
to attend at No. 85, open the Correspondence, and advise on
(•igars. However, the Committee voted by 73 to 44 that he
should not be open to a new engagement.
Then we hacf a squabble on the City Charities, and in
nnswer to complaint that a good deal of City money was
spent in hospitalities, Mr. Alderman Lawrence said, with
noble spirit, that it
"had been from time immemorial the custom for the Companies to
giro entertainments in their halls to distinguished persons and
other*, and this, by bringing men of different ranks and different
sentiments together, tended beneficially to mould opinion in the
City. Those attacks against the Livery Companies of the City of
I ondon were but a pandering to vulgar prejudices."
"Well said, Mr. Alderman. Elderman Punch has sat at
good men's feasts in the City, and he maintains that money
is much better spent in regaling intellectual persons like
himself than in creating generations of pauper pensioners
on charity. Your health, Mr. Alderman, nnd soon may you
bold to us the Loving Cup, though that mixture is not nice
by any means, and might be inconceivably improved by the
compounder's studying a delightful little book on Cool
Drinks."
Here's glory! Hats off! The ncad of the Stationerv-
Office has reduced the number of steel-pens used in the
public offices by one-third, and, listen, the number of quill-
pens from 840,000 to 430,000! That's something for a
statesman to ho proud of. "Peace has her victories," and
so on. We have no idea who this distinguished economist
is, hut perhaps his ancestor fought at Chevy Chacc, and when
Sib Hugh Montgomeby was shot, picked the Grey Goose
Wing off the arrow, and said that it would " do again."
We sat till nearly one at this sort of thing, and Walpole
kindly begged us off the morning's sitting for next day.
The rigid-minded Head Master being away, the gentle
Bbuce gave us the holiday.
Friday. Government signified that they had received no
communication from the French authorities on the subject
of the delivering up of refugees. Nor have Government
taken the liberty of remonstrating with M. TniERs as to
the amount of chastisement which he was inflicting upon
incendiaries and assassins.
Mr. White, speaking on the Estimates, did not think
that we ought to tax the present generation in order to
relieve posterity from some of the National Debt. He
thought that posterity would be able to manage its own
affairs better than we manage ours, or else all the Educa-
tion we are bestowing will be thrown away. After some
brilliant displays of fireworks—we mean figures—which
dazzled the House, the Chancellor op the Exchequer
waxed eloquent on our duty to those who will come after
us, and insisted on our manifesting patriotism and self-
denial. He really delivered himself of a "fine finish,"
and the House applauded him heartily. Should the English
(he asked), in the exuberance of their prosperity, say that
they would do nothing for their successors?
"If they did so, would they not deserve the taunt of Horace to
the Roman youth:
Non his juventus orta parentibus,
Infecit sequor sanguine Punico?
No one would believe that they were the children of the men of
Waterloo nnd Trafalgar."
After this two Counts were tried in vain, but on the
third Count the House was found guilty of being no House,
"and so to bed."

Castle, May, 1871.
To walk four miles, to miss your faithless friend,
To find he's gone and left no trace behind,
Tour lonely way adown his park to wend,
And try to look as if you didn't mind.
In Bunshinc fierce four other miles to grind,
To see the fortress of a Reiver bold,
With but your dog, who's silent, though he's kind—
This is not Solitude, 'tis but to hold
Converse with Border Lore, and view its castles old.
But on that ruined Castle's topmost stone—
When you have clambered up by niche and oleft;
Cheered by the thought, though other joys are flown,
Of one—your weed—you oannot be bereft—
To make a cigarette with fingers deft,
To roll it firm, and know that it is good,
And then to find that not one light is left,
Of all you've stolen, borrowed, bought, and sue'd—
This is to be alone—this, this is Solitude.
, Luxury.
General Trocitu attributes many of the misfortunes of French-
men to their having adopted habits of "English luxury." What
does he mean? Soap and water? Wo are unaware that we have
taught them the use of any other luxury, and this, as tourists will
testify, has been very partially adopted. The Breton is hard upon
the Briton. By the way, the French London paper, the Inter-
national, translates the General's phrase thus: Le confortable
emprunti aux Anglais." Then we don't think he did mean soap
and water.
SPIRIT DRAWINGS.
Among other sights in London we see advertised an exhibition
of Spirit Drawings, which perhaps may prove attractive to lovers ot
the marvellous. We have not the slightest notion what these
drawings can be like, but visitors describe them as being done in
water colours, and they are said to have been "designed under the
influence of spirits." Of course we should not dream of hinting that
there can be m this latter phrase a subtle alcoholic reference, else,
instead of saying they were done in water colours, we might perhaps
suggest that they were done in gin-and-water colours. _ We should
not dream of speaking slightingly of any artist-work which we have
never seen; but, whatever, be the merits of this spirit exhibition,
we cannot help opining that the drawing of the cork of a bottle of
good whiskey would to our taste be about the very best of spirit
drawings.
LIBERTT OF CONSCIENCE AND CUP.
WnAT would the Dissenting Ministers who belong to the United
Kingdom Alliance say if either the Publicans or the Parsons were to
get up an agitation for a Permissive Prohibitory Act to empower
the majority of the rate-payers in any parish to close all the
meeting-houses?
A Conventicle is not unfrequently the superstructure of a Wine
Vault. A law prohibiting both Dissent and Liquor, which would
consist with freedom and justice quite as much as a law pro-
hibiting Liquor only, in shutting up both the cellar and the chapel
together, would kill two birds at a snot.
No Vain Boast.
There is a Giantess now to be seen in London, who is advertised
as " Her Majesty's largest subject, and the tallest person known to
exist." Our friend and neighbour is at last outdone, for this great
person must, surely, have a superior claim to be considered the pos-
sessor of the "largest circulation in the world."

WHY DO THE PROPHETS RAGE?
Why do our prophets now-a-days make it a rale to get into such
passions? Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, Victor Hugo—all
seem to find it impossible to write without lashing themselves into a
lather, and, like Homeric heroes, using the biggest, roughest, and
heaviest words their great hands can wield to knock down their
antagonists with. De. Joiinson, in the last century, was rather
given to the same sort of assault; but, after all, there was a balance
in his fury, and a method in his madness. He, at least, brained
people with a weapon of regular rhetorical construction, called an
antithesis. But our prophets scorn anything regular, and the more
rough and ready the missile they can catch up to pelt people with,
the Detter they seem to like it. And now here is Charles Reade,
the most amiable of men, except on paper, heating himself red-hot,
and writing himself rabid, over the stupidities of English house-
building and house-builders in the Pall Mall.
Goodness knows, there is enough to get sad or savage over, either,
in the subject. Have we not all water-pipes and drains? Know
we not all that cruel persecutor called the plumber t Did not John
Leech put the grievance into pictures that will live for ever, in the
woful history of Mr. Briqgs's Loose Tile?
3ut why should Charles Reade work himself up into so rabid a
state of mind that he forgets the meaning of words, as well as the
amenities of good language? If he must christen the British Work-
man " The Curse of Families" (in large caps)—and far be it from
Punch to say he isn't—what does he mean by talking of common
house-tops as "conical"? My dear Charles Reade, the corner
turrets of an old French or Scotch chateau were conical. The tower
of Langham Church is conical. An extinguisher is conical. But
conical a common British house-roof is not. It is ridged, if you
like; but that, as you know very well, is a perfectly different thing.
And, by the way, there is something to be said for a ridged roof, if
yon can say a great deal very forcibly, not to say furiously, against
It. It gives us a clear off-shoot for our rainfall, and helps us to a
readier riddance for our snow. Neither would be so easily com-
passed with a flat roof; though, to be sure, you might give it a slight
incline.
You suggest that a flat roof would give poor Cocknevs a country
view. You picture to yourself, like a kind-hearted soul as you are,
a poor fellow after working all day in a hole, like a sparrow on the
house-tops, smoking "his evening-pipe," and seeing a wide tract
of verdure." But while he was smoking, what would the chimneys
round him be doing? How about the blacks?
Then you say the " conical" roof robs poor families of their drying
grounds.
But suppose the flat roofs round about the poor Cockney decorated
with the sheets and towels and tablecloths, shirts and chemises of
the family wash, what would become of your poor Cockney's "view
of the wide tracts of verdure"?
I doubt, my dear Charles, if there would be anything so green
in Bight as somebody's eye. However, far be it from Punch to say that
there is not a great deal of truth in your Jeremiad against house-
builders and their ways and works, but the truth would be none the
less forcible for being put in a little milder and civiller language.
If the prophets in the old time flung as big and hard words as you
and your brethren, no wonder people occasionally took to retaliating
with hard stones.
A Nominal Advantage.
Certainly some aotors are happy in their names. For instance,
olever M. Got of the Comedie Francaise. However insignificant a
oharacter may be, it is clear that when he plays it there is sure to be
a Oot in it.

THE CENSUS.

'i he Census returns are now so far complete as to enable
jj us to state, approximately, their general results. The
jMl. three most 81112111? peculiarities in them are as follows—
I. In some places the population has increased.
II. In other places the population has decreased,
III. In the remaining plaoes the population is exactly the same as
it was ten years ago. The delightful village of Bramblethorpe, for
example, numbers 159 inhabitants in 1871, just as it did in 1861.
Value of the living in the Queen's Books, £1334 per annum. Rector
non-resident, on account of the delicate state of his mother-in-law's
health: mostly lives in South Italy.
Step by step persons having wooden legs are gradually disappear-
ing, in consequence of the improvements introduced by science in
the construction of artificial limbs.
There are still a good many oldest inhabitants scattered about in
different parts of the country, but their ultimate extinction is cer-
tain, as railways penetrate into the more remote districts, and the
inclosure of Commons becomes universal.
Croquet, which was in its infancy when the last decennial calcu-
lations were made, is now one of our most cherished Institutions.
The returns show that the number of persons practising archery has
declined in consequence, but the long bow is still drawn to a great
extent.
There is a large increase in the number of artists. This at first
sight would seem to encourage the hope that Art is spreading
amongst us; but a careful analysis shows that acrobats, athletes,
comic vocalists, Negro minstrels, conjurers, ventriloquists, funam-
bulists, pyrotechnists, shampooers, and workers in nair, all call
themselves artists. On the other hand it is gratifying to find that
the willow-pattern, on our domestic earthenware, is giving way to
designs of a more elegant and ornamental character.
Sixty-two per cent, of the umbrellas in the United Kingdom were
alpaca. (There are more umbrellas in Manchester than in any other
place in England.)
Berlin-wool work is on the decline.
How insignificant is now the consumption of what was once a
Briton's favourite wine is proved by the circumstance that only
seven Enumerators were offered a glass of port!
In London alone, on the day the Census was taken, 164,518 seal-
skin jackets were in use — of these but 39,707 were bond fide
preparations of the natural covering of the Phoca vitulina.
Ninety per cent, of the population have had their photographs
taken, and in three parlours out of five the Enumerators found
an album lying on the table.
Although we have half-penny papers, penny readings, School
inspectors, International Exhibitions, and Revised Codes; in some
districts it was found that the Duke of Wellington was the latest
person of celebrity known to the inhabitants.
Sixteen different preparations of cocoa were in use.
Musical Instruments have multiplied, so have " kettle-drums."
212,901 persons were out on their Honeymoon: of these 204,315
acknowledged that they wished it was over. Seven out of ten had

Punning is frightfully on the increase.
The rule is to give children two, often three, names. The elder

Of the Monkeys of old
What a pleasant race they were,
And it seems most true
That I and you
Are derived from an Apish pair.
They all had nails
And some had tails,
And some—no "accounts in arrear,"
They climbed up the trees
And they scratched out the these
Of course I will not mention here.
They slept in a wood
Or wherever they could,
For they didn't know how to make beds,
They hadn't got huts,
They dined upon nuts,
Which tney cracked upon each other's heads.
They hadn't much scope
For a comb, brush, or soap,
Or towels, or kettle, or fire.
They had no coats, nor capes,
For ne'er did these apes
Invent what they didn't require.
The sharpest baboon
Never used fork or spoon,
Nor made any boots for his toes,
Nor could any thief
Steal a silk handkercAiV/,
For no ape thought much of his nose;
They had cold collations,
They ate poor relations;
Provided for thus, by the bye.
No Ou-rang-ou-tang
A song ever sang—
He couldn t—and so, didn't try.
From these though descended,
Our manners are mended,
Though still we can grin and back-Me;
We cut up each other,
Be he friend or brother,
And tails are the fashion—at night.
This origination
Is all speculation—
We gamble in various shapes;
So Mk. DxRwiJf
May speculate in
Our Ancestors having been Apes.

THE CABMAN OF THE FUTURE.
Amono tho benefits which may result from the Education Act is
the chance of some improvement in the language and demeanour of
our Cabmen. We may nopef ully expect that a man who has received
the advantage of instruction in English Grammar will never dream
of saying that the "streets is hup," as a reason for his driving
by a route somewhat circuitous. Nor, after having passed a School
Examination, will he so far forget himself as to call out, "'Ere
y' are, Sir!" when summoned from his stand, but, with more cor-
rectness, will make answer, "Here I am, Sir! Instruction having
smoothed the roughness of his manners, instead of snarling out,
"Vot *8 this?" when he is offered a less sum than he conceives to
be his due, he wiH show the good effects of his soholastic training by
politely offering his views upon the matter, and will doubtless add
that if he be in error he is open to correction. "I humbly beg your
pardon. Sir. bnt is this a good specimen of the current coinage of
the realm? he will say, when he is given what he thinks is a bad
shilling; and, in Bhort, his whole demeanour will be so much im-
proved that his vehicle the Hansom will be known as the Polite,
and the Growler will be wholly superseded by the Smilcr.
Something to their
"WANTED, s Female Head Attendant"
If this is meant as a delicate intimation that the servioes of a
"young person" are required in a hair-dresser's shop (establish-
ment, rather), we hail it as a satisfactory proof that employment of
a suitable description oan be obtained by women, without their
meddling with occupations which are not fitting for them to under-
take.
A GIFT THAT WILL BE APPRECIATED.

GUNS VERSUS TABGETS.
THE TWO FIRE-ENGINES.
FRENCH.
ENGLISH.
A black-breeches gun, whose hot throat belches fire,
Served by fierce men, and Maenads fiercer still,
Behind a barricade, with the blind ire
That cares not to be killed, so it can kill.
Raining its ghastly rain of shot and shell,
That wither life and quicken seed of flame.
And sing upon their way with shriek and yell,
As of fiends, loosed from hell, for hell's own game.
Fire in the track of slaughter following hard,
With black destruction crowning bloody death,
Till men bewildered 'gainst what foe to guard,
Under the sulphurous reek draw doubtful breath.
Death dealt; death faced: death poisoning the air
With charnel taint: death so familiar grown,
That children in their play the blue limbs bare
Of the thin mould o er their corruption strown.
Blood spattered on the walls: and steps and stones:
Tinging the gutters with a ruddy stain:
Wet blood and not of fight that ill atones
For the cold blood of prisoners sudden slain.
Hate, that the conquered may not speak, but show;
Hate, the inglorious conquerors loud proclaim;
Who, cowards as they are, no pity know,
To whom age is a mock, and sex a name.
So we saw Paris, in her blood and dust,
From pinnacle of queenly state brought low;
And this black Gun, sole engine she can trust
To quench and quell the fares that work her woe!
An engine of old build, whose slow design
Took ages to work out, but built to last,
Of stout oak, welded iron, line on line,
Riveted carefully, and mortised fast.
"Unity " is the name this engine bears,
The tackle is laid taut and trim and true;
To work the pumps, when conflagration glares,
We trust a mingled, but well-ordered, crew.
Britannia, captain of our Fire-brigade,
Claims right to press all, from the Sovereign down,
Proud Peer, or prouder Franklin, son of trade,
Hard-handed artizan, and stalwart clown.
All are alike alert to lend a hand
'Gainst fire—worst foe that wisdom bids men fear:
'Tis for the common-weal, not for command,
They spring to handles, and see hose laid clear.
Now with a will, my boys! Long pull and strong,
And all together, with the pumps, give way!
Lo, through the throbbing hose, well-aimed, and strong,
Clear streams of common sense quench where they play!
Thank Heaven and our good hap—no dangerous blaze
Is this that vents its fever fit of flame
'Neath the Trafalgar lions' scornful gaze;
Scarce need of engine such toy-fires to tame!
Yet 'tis well e'en on sparks that wake no fear
To bring the douche of common sense to bear:
So shall we find, if far-off fire came near,
Crew at their post, pumps clear, and hose laid fair.
SUGGESTION FOR THE NEXT BUDGET.
We are told that " the Bombay Government has thrown over the
scheme of a tax on native feasts. This is a valuable hint, which
ought not to be lost. Why should not the British Government take
such a scheme up, and raise a large revenue by levying a tax on our
native, our City feasts? The Corporation of London, the Great
Companies, various sets of Charity Trustees, and other similar
bodies, some of which hardly know now to dispose of their funds,
would, we are sure, be only too glad to lessen the burdens now laid
on the struggling and hard-working classes, by paying the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer a fixed sum per mouth every time they
sat down to a great dinner or banquet. The guests themselves,
perhaps, might not object to be mulcted in a moderate sum—they
would relish the dainties set before them none the less, if they felt
they were doing something to relieve their less favoured country-
men, and help Mr. Lowe. (N.B. Turtle extra.)

General Tbochu has been talking about the causes of French

Much good may it do him and its hearers I
He "exhorts the nation to humble itself before Him who casts

Excellent advice!
He declares " that a great many reforms are needed."
There can't he a doubt of it. It needs no Trochtj to tell France
thai.

It s a way it has always had.

"Self-sacrifice and devotedness had been abandoned for mere
personal considerations."
Not exactly a new habit—of twenty years' growth—that, one
would fancy.

and Italian corruption!"
Well! that is somothinglike a discovery—On diable? "English
luxury" at the bottom of French disasters—" English luxury," and
"Italian corruption"? Till now both England and Italy, we rather
think, had fancied that they might have had to thank French
luxury and French corruption for some rather unpleasant pheno-
■ fashions and opinions, lives and literature,
But Trociju has his "plan," of disaster, as well as defence, and,
in that, England stands charged with enervating France by her
"luxury," and Italy with fouling her by her corruption! 'Live
and learn" is a good motto. Henceforth, we will hear in mind,
when people talk of French demi-monde, French partie-fine, French
milliners, French modesty, French cooks, French coiffeurs, French
cancanieres, French cocottqs, French danseuses, French novels,

all, at the bottom of them, and account for all their mischief!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MY HEALTH.
'Camuel summoned. Short conversation
■3 without. Re-enter Samuel. He comes
up to me persuasively, "You won't
mind, Sar, two genelmen seeing over
di8 place P"
I reply (being in his hands) "0, no
certainly not;" though I don't feel that
I'm precisely in the Btate in which I
should like to receive visitors. It
appears, however, that the Turkish
Baths are a novelty here, and strangers,
or residents, are admitted to view
them.
Samuel explains the room to them,
1 and takes me as part of it. I remem-
ber going over a Lunatic Asylum once,
and a gaol, and wondering how the
comparatively-sensible lunatics and the
prisoners liked being shown off. 1
fancy that I experience their sensa-
tion now. Rather I should say the
Lunatic's sensation,—one who has de-
stroyed all his clothes, and has been
placed in a room by himself. I don't
experience shyness exactly, but feel
sulkily resentful at this intrusion. They
don't quite ignore me; on the contrary,
they stand near the door, hardly going
away from it, as if afraid of my making
a sudden dart at them, perhaps for the
sake of their clothes and boots, when
Samuel isn't looking, and, at this
rcspeotful distance, they give a sort of half bow to me, as if they
wore calling upon a gentlemanly maniac of uncertain temper, or
had been admitted by Samuel, into the den of a partially-tamed
animal, unsafe except under the keeper's eye. Mem. The idea
occurs to me, perhaps one of these visitors is Ms. Darwin in search
of evidence corroborative of his theory. Unpleasant.
Mem. Think I've read of a Hermit, near Cambridge, who had to
be "interviewed" in this way. There seems, too, to be the ingre-
dients for a Historical Romance in this situation. "The Man in the
Turkish Bath," like "The Man in the Iron Mask." Head very hot.
Wish I could get my note-book in here. Left it in first room—can't
return for it, on account of Growler's " stupidity with strangers."
The "Genelmen" retire, inclining towards me very civilly on
their exit. I do the honours of the first hot-room as well as I can.
Samuel returns, and brings me a glass of mineral water. Iron. "Is
that a good thing?" I inquire. De best thing possible," answers
Samuel. "What's its effect P" I ask, holding the glass in my
hand. Mem. Simile: Socrates putting a few scientific questions
to the Gaoler before taking the fatal draught.
"You drink that, Sar," replies Samuel, "and it make you all
fresh for de next room, den you go in and jist do what I tell you,
and take your time over it, 'cos, dat's what I say, you genelmen, do
what you like, you need not hurry; you enjoy, he pronounces
"enjy" "de bath. You put yourself in de state for Naytchar to
act; you give Naytchar a chance, and you bless Providence you come
'ere. You take my word for it, Sar—now, Sar," says he, drawing
back a red-baize curtain, as if he was going to snow me a real
chef (Tceuvre, "You walk in dere! pro-ceed!
I enter the hotter room: it nearly knocks me down at first. On
recovering myself a little, I find it is like a very clean wine-
cellar, without bins, having a sort of opaque Gothic screen, with
intervals of kaleidoscopic-coloured glass on one side, and fitted (the
cellar, not the screen) with a narrow sort of dresser fixed against the
side walls. Here in a corner lies Budd on a mattrass, prostrate, an
appalling figure at first, (reminding me of Cruixshank's illus-
trations to the Tower of London—"Somebody, as he appeared after
the rack") until one gets accustomed to him, and then I begin to
understand that he is enjoying himself, tropically.
Samuel places a mattrass and a pillow for me; motions me
statuesquely to my place.
Budd, without moving in the least, utters a sort of pleased sound;
implying, I fancy, that in spite of his present condition he recognises
us and appreciates my progress.
Samuel approaches him; he regards Mm as a work of his own
hands with profound admiration, nay even with an appearance of
religious veneration for "Naytchar" in a Paradise of 160 degrees, and
drawing a deep breath, exclaims, "Ah, beautiful!"
Budd appears pleased, and intimates briefly his intention of re-
maining where he is, until inclined to take the douche or the needle.
I am reclining now, and feel that I am all Head. Or perhaps—if
I can exert myself to think at all about it—that my head is Central
Africa under a burning sun, and my feet are the North Pole at
night. . . . Too languid to ask about needles or douches. . . . Lie
on my back—look at ceiling. . . .
Thoughts, or beginnings of Trains of Thoughts (while recumbent at
160* in the shade). Early Christian Martyrs. ... I hear a noise and
a roaring—Chrintianos ad leones! . . . (Budd says, "They're making
up the furnace ") . . . Saint Lawrence on gridiron . . . Remember
picture in Antwerp Gallery—torture—wonder how I should_ stand
it. . . . Good practice here for beginners. . . . Noise of engine, as
if we were going somewhere by steam. . . . Wonder if I shall be ill
. . . Wonder why I am not in a profuse perspiration . . . Shall I
mention it P . . no. . . Hair brittle. . . . Enter Samuel, with more
water. ... I drink. . . . Samuel only says, "0 beautiful! it's
NayteAar.'" . . . I complain of my feet being cold.
I wouldn't hab it no oderwise," replies Samuel, seriously, waving
his right hand as if to dissipate any other notions on the subject that
may be floating about in the air, "Wait till I come to shampoo, den
you '11 know what de beauty ob it is." He retires.
Thoughts. My Aunt. . . Doddridge . . .the Dove . . . Will re-
commend them a Turkish Bath . . . Might do little Dog's leg gooa
. . . take the affectation out of him. . . Must manage to get away . . .
Look at Budd ... He smiles and I smile . . . Think of when I
knew him years ago as a boy . . . Think of the ceiling . . . the
bricks . . . how impossible it is to do anything in this state . . .
Query, is it waste of time, or not? . . . Can't I think out something?
. . . Bruce and spider ... a poem ... a play ... an invention
to ... to ... do something wonderful . . . thoughts chiefly on
ceiling . . . engine hard at work . . . more furnace . . . Round of
thought all over again about Martyrs, St. Lawrence, &c, &c.
Wonder if Budd feels this? I mean feels that he'ean't concentrate
his thoughts on any one thing nowP I ask him. He answers,
"Don't know—don't try," and seems, on the whole, perfectly
satisfied with inanition.
I will do the same. ... I am doing the same. ... Enter Samuel,
without his bed-curtain dress, and in an acrobatic costume, like
ours. He carries a little bowl of water, and evidently means
business. He approaches me.
He refreshes me with the bowl of water, emptying it over my
head. Delicious. He jerks my arms, cracks my joints. I am help-
less. He plays tunes with his fists all over me. When sufficiently
pummelled and jerked, I am led out tenderly, by Samuel, into
another room. I remember (at this instant) having heard the
Clown say to the Pantaloon in the pantomime, "Hallo, here! hi!
I say! come and be washed!" This is what, in action, Samuel
says to me.
Then follows a charmingly refreshing process, managed exquisitely,
and scientifically, by Samuel. I sit on a chair and have water
dashed over me. I am soaped and lathered, and while I am trying
to open my eyes, down comes the contents of another bowl of water
right over me. "Naytchar" is gasping. I am put into_ a sort of
cage, standing, and am enervated t>y a shower of tepid water,
revived by an avalanche of cold water from above, braced up by
cold water from the sides, from round the corner, from in fact all
sorts of places whence you'd least expect it.
I clutch the rails of my cage, convulsively; more gasping.
Through the mist of the spray I see Samuel with a hose, as if he
were putting me out. I try to say, "Hi! that's enough!" But
I can't, and, as he thinks I am enjoying myself immensely, he gives
me some more. Niagara all over, and round and round. ... He
stops ... I recover my breath . . . gasping over ... I feel
invigorated, inclined to shout, to spring up, to dance. One more turn,
a thousand watering-pots are pointing their very small bore roses at
me, and as it were, pricking me all over. This is the Needle.
Then I am told to pro-ceed" by Samuel, and am directed to
step under a round iron ring.
More cold water. A chest expander. Here I could stop for somo
time longer, but Samuel won't hear of it. So I am hurried away
by Samuel, rubbed over, wrapped up in a sheet, which he pic-
turesquely folds over my shoulaers, and am finished off ("This
style oomplete") with a turban, which he skilfully winds round my
head.
He leads me to Room No. 1, shows me a pallet, places me com-
fortably, leaves me to the most soothing influences of a semi-dozing
state and a cigarette, and returns in about five minutes, or more
(but time does go at such a pace in a Turkish Bath), with Budd
costumed in the same style—Mahommedans both. Samuel is right,
so far, at all events. I do thank him; I haven't felt so well for an
age as I do now. I experience a sort of buoyant feeling, so that, if
I could be transported to our house, at once, I could dance round my
Aunt, kick the birdcage into a corner, pull the dog's tail, and do a
polka with Doddridge.
Mem. "So well, now." As I make this note in my pocket-book,
I am lying on the pallet and gradually becoming so hungry that I
would dine here, on the spot, at once, but for the shock my
absence would cause my Aunt.
Samuel is right when he exclaims, "Beautiful! Beautiful!"

CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
onday, June 5, [That is
to say you may call it
June, if you like, or
Junius, or Juvenal, or
January; the month
by any other name
would make you shiver
as much] the Lords

'unch has re-
cea to welcome back

Canterbury, who has
for a long time been an
Archbishop in partibus
—Well, We suppose it
would be uncharitable
tO finish the descrip-
tion. ITisGrace'shealth

novated (L. renoto)
and the ne^s gives
Mr. Punch much satis-
faction, for he admir-
eth DHv Archibald
,. Campbell Tait, as
S hath been shown Caf-
toonically.
Lord Sandhurst
(Sir William Mans-
field is an authority)
complains that the
Army folks enlist mere
boys, who break down.
The Duke of Cam-
bridge pleaded that
we are trying to make
an Army of Reserve,
and our steps are " tentative." Boys are not famous for reserve, and we should
be sorry to see them practise it, but if " tentative " means teaching them to live
in tents, of course it s all right.
Sir J. C. Lawrence stated that the reason Kew Bridge is not made free is
that the proprietors ask £70,000. They have opened their mouths very wide
for money, and may now as well keep them open with astonishment, for their
flanks have been turned, and three other bridges are enfranchised instead of
Kew. Q, derives its name from its little tail, queue, and should wag it more
humbly.
Lord Enfield was asked something about China, but had not muoh to say.
Readers may notice that every now and then comes a telegram from Mr. Wade,
who says that "all is quiet in China." We hold up our hands and bless
General Wade, as the verse goes, but if we received a message every Monday
saying "Jones is sober," we should draw no inference unfavourable to the
belief in Mr. Jones's habitual ebriety for the future. People conoerned, aocept
this hint.
The Colonels went on with the fight against the Purchase Bill, and there was
this little episode. Sir George Jenkinson was speaking, some Liberals cried
"01" and Sir George asked—
"Why should the Prime Minister sit there laughing at an independent Member?
{Cheer* and laughter.)
"Mr. Gladstone.—I rise to order. I vrtm not laughing at the Hon. Gentleman.
(Cheers.)
"Sib G. Jenkinson.—What, then, were you laughing at? (Laughter and cheers.)
"Mb. Gladstone.—I cheered, and did not laugh. (Cheers.)
"Sib G. Jenkinson was much obliged. The cheers of the Prime Minister were
always gracious."
Afterwards there was resistance to Morning Sittings, and as the House was
then sitting into the morning, and did sit till nearly three, there was reason
even in Mr. Bentinck's opposition. This reminds us that Mr. Atrton is said
to intend to hav« a Lime-Light kindled on the Clock Tower, as an intimation to
the universe that while that fire burns Parliament is sitting. Does he think
that the world will also sit up till three in the morning, watching the Gabble-
Beacon? The only use of such an arrangement will be to promote quarrel
between M.P. and wife, as thus :—
M.P. (stumbling—rather—into his dressing-room, and quarrelling with his
watch-key. Time 2'30 a.m.) Confound that Glads'on! No bizzis to keep's up
till this hour, soussin' ognishasun Army.
Smiling Wife (/rom her bed, and laying down novel, and extinguishing lamp).
Won't do, dear. 1 saw Mr. Ayrton's Lime-Light go out at half-past eleven.
Been lucky at billiards?
Tuesday. Germany, says Lord Enfield, has made no proposal for the cession
to her of Heligoland (population 2,230). If Campbell had not written the
Death Boat of Heligoland, we suppose nobody would have known of the
existence of the island. Nevertheless and neverthe-
more, we mean to keep it, unless Germany wants it so
much as to be induced to offer us something in exchange.
There's a pawky auld Scots proverb of which English
folk are not nearly mindful enough, and it is—slightly
refined for Southron consumption, Keep yourain fish-
insides for your ain sea-mews."
We had a very good debate, initiated by Mb. Graves,
on Manning—no, not the Archbishop, though he is
always a pleasant subject for conversation (besides we
should have said Dr. Manning, ours are not Exeter
Hall manners) but on Manning the Navy. Government
denies that we are'under-manned, but admits dissatis-
faction with the state of the Reserves. The cause for
that feeling had better be removed at once, for John
Bull, though he has shown that he will bear a good
deal more than he ought, will stand no nonsense about
his Ships.
Wednesday. Debate on the Burials Bill, a measure for
allowing all person* to bury their friends in the church-
yards of the Church of England, but with any kind of
Service the survivors like, or speeches, or nothing at all.
The Bill made its way by some large majorities, and the
moderate Dissenters say that if they get this and the
University Tests repeal, they will have no more griev-
ances. The Church-people say that the next demand
will be for the church itself, m which to make funeral
orations, declaim funeral odeSj ot enunciate heterodoxies.
As has been often said here, when will Englishmen learn
to believe in Englishmen?
The Bill for appointing Public Prosecutors is thrown
over. How much it is wanted was proved within the
last few days. The Recorder, who tried a case, and had
to direct an acquittal because of failure of evidence, said
that a note had been found in his court, showing why
the necessary evidence had not been brought forward—
the affair had been " squared," the prosecutor receiving
a (ram of money, and the counsel were requested to "put
it in the best shape they could."
"My lords the judges laugh, and you 're dismissed."
Only Mr. Russell Gurnev did by no means laugh, and
very properly told Parliament what had happened.
Thursday. The Martello towers—you know—you see
them when you go to the watering-places by the sea—
well, some are to be pulled down, and some are to be
kept up. Punch objects to the pulling down; the use-
less ones might be slightly repaired—they are capital
places of shelter when a storm comes on, and Jemima is
in a dreadful way with you for having tempted her to
walk out and get her bonnet spoiled. Punch wonders
whether Ministers ever kept company with any
Jemimas; he supposes not, or the Cabinet would be more
considerate.
But we had some fun. There had been a Count Out
(as Mr. Punch mentioned) on the previous Friday.
After the Count Out, somebody was showing the House
to a friend, and found on the table a little note which
Sir John Pakington had seen given to Mr. Forster,
during a speech of his, which speech he cut short, that
the Count might come. The note was—" We want to
count Paklngton: he comes next." The finder gave
this document to Sir John, who read it to the House,
with comment on the conduct of Government.
So we had the gravest debate, in which Mb. Glad-
stone and Mr. Disraeli took part, and the questions
were two-fold. The interesting one was whether Sir
John Pakington was right in reading and using a
communication evidently intended to bo private. His
character as a man of honour is, of course, unquestion-
able, but Mr. Gladstone thought he lhad erred," and
Mr. O'Reilly was "much surprised," and so forth.
Mr. Disraeli saw no objection to using a scrap of paper,
without name, signature, or envelope. Mr. Hardy
could not think it a private document. The debate was
enlivened by our friend Mr. Collins, of Boston, sticking
up for Counts Out, and being called "impertinent" by
Mr. Newdeoate, who had to alter the epithet to
"ofHciou8." Mr. C. Bentinck thought that the Thirty-
One paid members of the Government ought to be ordered
to remain in their places, and thus ensure a House.
More debate on the Army Bill, and Mr. Rylands, the
Didactic, said that he would endeavour to deserve the
name by teaching the public what this Bill meant. He
objected to making Income-tax payers pay officers for

officer paid them, and that it would be harsh and indeed dishonour-
able to stand upon a rule which custom had abolished. Mr. Vernon
Harcourt made rather a good speech on the harsh side, and jeered
at "connivance," and quoted the non omnibus dormio story (it
means (hastily), M'm, that you should never go to sleep in an
omnibus, as you may have your pocket picked—let us go on) and
connivance cost the first Stuart his throne, which is news to Mr.
Punch, who fancied Jamie died as much a king as he could be.
Eventually, the Didactic proposal was rejected by the large majo-
rity of 285 to 108, as might have been expected in a house of
liberal-hearted men.
Friday. A speech, which would of course have been something to
hear, was expected from the Bishop of Peterborough on Lord

There were only from 15 to 20 British subjects among the insur-

him because various French heroes of the same size are in custody.

Nothing but a hatful of Points of Exclamation could do justice to

surgeon, who, in the
intervals of using
his scalpel on bones
and bodies, uses the
etching-needle on

way to astonish the
artists. But before
Seymour Haden
was Whistler, his
brother-in-law, and
etching master.
And now Ellis of
King Street, Covent
Garden, has pub-
lished a portfolio of
James Whistler's
Etchings, which ar-
tists say beat every-
thing of the kind
that nas been turned
out since Rem-

world what etching-
needle and aqua-
fortis could do to
scratch and bite in
meanings and me-
mories on the face
of a copper-plate,
and in the admira-
tion of artists for all
time to come.
Whistles has
etched the tumble-
down bank-side
buildingsof Thames,
from Wapping and
Limehouse and Ro-
therhithe to Lam-
beth and Chelsea,
above-bridge—great
gaunt warehouses,
and rickety sheds,
and balconies and
gazebos hanging all
askew, and rotting
piles and green
weeded quays and
oozy steps and hards,
where masts and
yards score the sky
over your head, and
fleets of barges dar-
ken the mud and
muddy water at your
feet, and all is pitchy
and tarry, and corny
and coally, and an-
cient and fish-like.
Such etohings of this queer long-shore reach and marine-store
dealers, and ship-chandlers,,bonded warehousemen,and boatbuilders,
anciant mariners, and corn-porters, wherry-men, and wharfingers,
Thames-police, and mud-larks, are all the more precious because
the beauties they perpetuate are dying out—what with embank-
ments and improvements, increase* value of river frontage, and
natural decay of planking and piling.
Whistler has immortalised Wapping, and given it the grace
that is beyond the reach of anything but art. Let all lovers of good
art and marvellous etching who want to know what Father Thames
was like before he
took to having his
bed made, invest in
Whistler's port-
folio. We will an-
swer for it, that—
dear as it may be,
those who buy it
won't say they've
paid too dear for

MY HEALTH.
N the whole, I am much
benefited by Turkish Baths.
How much? To the extent,
at present, of one sove-
reign. The way to value
the amount of good done,
is to compare in parallel
lines the number of Turk-
ish Baths taken in a week,
with the quantity of medi-
cine I might have had for
the same money.
Say, on one side, one
pound's worth of Turkish
On the other side, one
pound's worth of medi-
cines.
There can be no doubt
that four Turkish Baths
representing twelve days,
I couldn't, unless the doses
had been very expensive,
—old, dry, for example,
twenty years in bottle, and
"round in the mouth,"—
I couldn't have had my
money's worth out of them
in the same time. Pro-
bably, if I'd ventured upon that enormity, I should havu been, as
Budd puts it, a dead 'un.
My appetite and drinkatite are, comparatively, enormous. I am
constantly apologising to my Aunt for keeping her so long at dinner,
or luncheon.
Her observation to-day struck me as having something in it. It
was—"In some people a large appetite is a most unhealthy
Question. Have I suddenly gone to an extreme P
Diagnosis. Tuesday. Headache slight. Hot nose; and, un-
doubtedly, slightly red. Appetite up to (as it were) 19Q in the
shade, i.e., without exercise. My Aunt sighs and shakes her head.
She is of opinion that my coming with an apology three times for
roast mutton is unnatural. At first she was inclined to set it down
to " affectation."
Fourth Diagnosis. Wednesday. Intense sleepiness. Loss of
appetite between breakfast and luncheon, but sudden return of
same, with increased power, at l-30. Mustn't take anything now,
as it's T. B. day. Pouring wet. Saxtjel says, "Just the day for a
Bath; couldn't be better." Evening. Faint with hunger before
dinner. Sleepiness after dinner, when my Aunt is uncommonly
lively in her own way; i.e., she sings three of her most melancholy
songs — O do not Leave me! My Heart is Weary! O let me Die!
ana thoroughly wakes me up by bursting into tears over the last-
mentioned, when I have to ring for Doddridge to bring my Aunt's
pocket-handkerchief, which is almost immediately afterwards dis-
covered behind the sofa-cushion.
Then, when My Aunt is going to retire for the night, irrepressible
wakefulness sets in with me, which she remarking, more in sorrow
than in anger, cannot help observing, that " she is but dull company
for me ;" to which politeness requires me to answer, "0 nq, not at
all," and that she is afraid she depresses me; to which again polite-
ness and a certain amount of policy compel me to reply that " On the
contrary, 1 "when I finish, feeling that my acting is not up to
the occasion. She continues that she is sure I must be glad to get rid
of her; whereupon I try to return with effusion, as the Frenoh say,
"Get rid of you, my dear Aunt, why I'm sure that "But once
again I come to a standstill by the ingenuousness of my nature,
which is at this moment a nuisance, as 1 should like to be sympa-
thetic, and—if one could in private life—deliver a speech in blank
verse, expressive of how much I don't want to get rid of my Aunt,
and how immensely her songs, her presence, .and her manner
generally are calculated to cheer me.
I think I manage to look hurt at her imputation, but, somehow or
another, I equally feel that a smile is pulling up one corner of
my mouth, as Doddridge enters with the candle, and exclaims
(the toadie!) "0, Master George! how can you!" as if I'd hit
my Aunt, or been rude to her. And so she leads her up-stairs to
bed. When they've gone I find myself clenching my fist and' say-
ing, "Confound it! I never——" and here the Dove in her cage
says Coo-coo-oo exactly nine times, very slowly, and bowing to me
each repetition.
I do not get on with my Aunt. I really should like to for various
reasons, some being of genuine importance. I cannot. I've tried
it, and failed, and am still trying it. I cannot sympathise with the
little snappish King Charles and the monotonous Dove. Perhaps a
return of nealth, through the agency of the Turkish Baths at the
Cramville, makes me irritable, or, more proper]y speaking, impatient.
I know I should please my Aunt immensely—at least, I believe
so—if I nursed Charlie for two hours regularly, and said that I liked
his new collar with six bells all tinkling at once.
I objectwtoo, to being obliged, as it were, to share my meals with
Charlie. His dinner-hour is our dinner-hour, his breakfast-time is
our breakfast-time, and so on. From the moment we sit down he
commences a series of spasmodic yelps, enough to derange the
stoutest nerves; though my Aunt ana Doddridge only allude to
the horrid noise with rapture, as " almost speaking, isn't it? Dear
little Char'! »
"He's quite like a child, ain't he, Mum?" exclaims Doddridge,
admiringly. "Do give him that little bit on your plate, Master
George.
All my little bits go to Charlie. I like little bits myself; keeping
a reserve of them.
My Aunt has discovered that Charlie has an ear for music.
Doddridge (the sycophant!) exclaims, rapturously, "He almost
sings to you, don't he, Mum? Don't he, Master George?"
I say (being disturbed in reading Ketzler On Idiosyncratic In-
duction), "Yes, almost sings," and wish that he'd quite sing instead
of setting up the most dismal howl I ever heard, as an accompani-
ment to my Aunt's most]cheerful ballad, Longing to Die.
Keeping my eyes on my book (like " tne good St. Anthony," only
for a different reason), I meditate upon the quickest and best
of getting away from my Aunt and Ramsgate. Let me see, or
rather let me consider—while pretending to read—
Philosophical and Psychological Note.—Complex faculties, nega-
tive and positive.
(a) I am reading with my eyes, and a few sentences disjointed] y
get mixed up with my (b) thoughts on quite a different subject,
namely, how to break off (as it were) my connection with my Aunt,
while (c) my ears are trying to close themselves to the sounds of my
Aunt's singing, Charlie's howling, and the piano, and Doddridge's
laudatory ejaculations.
I have heard of a philosophical writer who could compose his most
serious and most successful essays while the junior members of his
family were blowing trumpets, beating drums, and fighting, the
elder branches talking and laughing, and his wife bothering him
about what he'd like for dinner. Wonderful. I recollect mention-
ing this to a Thinker of my acquaintance, who replied, "Concen-
trate yourself. You'll soon get accustomed to it." I am now
trying to concentrate myself. Note result for future psychological
analysis.
[Also, Note by the way. What a fine profession a Thinker's might
be. Say two thousand a year to Think, only to Think, not to
speak, or write, or to do anything. And then at the end of a term,
say three years, see what came of it. Your employers could then
decide upon retaining you or not.]
My Thoughts. If I could only get some one to send me a line—
Lines in book that come in here—" The desolating system of
empiricism" . . . {eyes wander) . . . "innate a priori perceptions"
{thoughts continued)—some one might send me a pressing invitation.
My Aunt'* voice (plaintively)—
Weary, so weary! so weary!
Break! break my heart with a sigh.
"Sigh" it a very high note; dog howls; Aunt prolongs note!
dog prolongs howl.

Piano accompaniment—chords. (Thoughts) I wish that dog was
—I wish that Doddridge—no—let me concentrate myself—let me
see—if somebody sends me [an invitation to say—(book again)—

trate . , ,
My Aunt, in a broken voioe, being much touched by her own
rendering of the song-

centrate myself now, and pretend to be absorbed.

Here my Aunt (I can't help attending to her) goes down several steps
(so to speak) in a minor key, evidently feeling the sentiment more
and more deeply, so that one almost expect*, ner to turn to Dodd-
ridge, and exclaim with the last note, Plunge a Dagger into me:

Result. Doddridge weeps, my Aunt catches Charlie in, her

What can 1 say? What can I do? I feel that, to sit still, is
almost brutal. I am hot, uncomfortable, feverish. This sort of
thing will quite counteract all the good of the Turkish Baths.
I must say something . . I do. I say, in as gentle a tone as
possible, " Aunt, shall I get you your pocket-handkerchief?" No
answer. I rise. Knock at door. Enormous Housemaid (the third
new one sinoe we've been here, each one bigger than the former,
and all quite Life Guardsmen in petticoats) brings a letter for my
Aunt. Perhaps this will assist me, and I shall be able to leave.
Letter to inform my Aunt that my Cousin John, from sea, has got
a few days' leave, and is coming to see. her. Then I can. go. I
will just stop to meet him and then go.
Note in Valetudinarian Diary. I think I 'am thinner. Sometimes
I fancy I'm not. It seems to me that I vary with the day. Last
Monday I seemed to be stouter than usual. On Tuesday I seem to
have gone down again. Odd. "Here to-day, and gone to-morrow."
Night. As I am lying awake—(somehow I do a great deal of lying
awake now—when I tell Samuel this, and attribute it to the Turkish
Baths, he exclaims, with open eyes and hands, "Well, Sar, why
not P and as I have no answer to this form of conundrum, he con-
tinues, almost angrily. "You don't want so much sleep—it's not
Naytchar "—but I don't think I quite agree with Samuel on this
point)—I think why it is I don't get on better with my Aunt P Also
wonder how my Cousin John from sea will get on with her. Shall see.
"WHERE THE CARCASE IS, THERE WILL THE EAGLES BE GATHERED TOGETHER."
Is she dead, or but dying, that lies yonder,—
Her white limbs half-hid in her fair, foul hair?
Are those life's last lights in her eyes that wander,
Or fires reflected in their lifeless stare P
Is't diamond or paste, this shattered star,
That mocks pale brows, and eyes no more impassioned?
Whence these black blood-gouts that her beauty mar,
And dash her robes, so fine and featly-fashioned?
Is this blood hers—or from that bird of death,
Whose throat she still grasps—that scarce-strangled vulture?
Which 'neath her dying hands gasped its foul breath,
And found in blood and ashes fit sepulture!
What says the true Word P "Where the carcase lies,
There will the eagles gather them together."
Methinks she must be dead—or why the skies
Dark of a sudden, in this summer weather,
With hungry eagles, that wheel o'er her head,
And for her fallen crown make rival proffer:
They had not ventured, but that France lies dead,
Or all too weak to warn or waive them off her?
The Bourbon Eagles—drawn from alien skies,
Nearly allied in kin, but not in kindness:
The elder bird, with feeble wing, and eyes
By introspective gaze filmed into blindness:
The younger, with a swifter, stronger, flight,
And keener, closer, farther-reaching vision;
Beady to sink old feuds, in pride's despite,
And bow in feudal family-submission.
And, hovering more apart, with watchful eye,
Belying languid sweep of draggled pinion,
The Imperial Eagle, whose day seemed gone by,
And quenched nis chances of renewed dominion.
And round these eagles, callow eaglets shrill,
Wheeling and waiting for their elders' swooping,—
And France stretched dead, or seeming dead—so still
Her limbs, so helpless 'gainst those eagles' stooping!
MUST WE THROW OUR CUCUMBERS OUT OF
WINDOWP
ie Cucumber—the
Cucumber, Horace
Walpole's ever-
lasting Cuoumber!
That too widely
emblematic vege-
table, which, after
being grown at
great expense, ga-
thered with dis-
criminative care,
prepared and
dressed with in-
finite pains and
skill, when all is
done, has to be
thrown out of win-
dow! The type of
so many dishes
prepared in prac-
tical John Bull's
kitchen! Isn't that
the way he makes
his gaol - birds?
How else does he
deal with nine-
tenths of his public
schoolboys P And
his recruits! Ask
Lord Sandhurst; what are they but an extensive case of Horace Walpole's
Cucumbers, dressed and flung away to the tune of some fifteen millions
a-year? Picked at 18; prepared at the cost of £ 100 per man, from 18 to 24;
and then pitched out of the window, on to the Indian dust-heap, or into the
London slum, just when the dressing is complete, and the Cucumber has been
made into good, nourishing, succulent food—for powder.
A lad from eighteen to twenty, it seems, by concurrence of general medical
opinion and dearly-bought experience, is good for nothing beyond the easiest
barrack-drill and,home-duty. Send him out to India, and he droops and
dies, or dwindles into a Queen's bad bargain, half his time, spent in

hospital, to be discharged at last a listless, useless,
broken-down, invalid, with a ruined character, a rotten
liver, and a confirmed taste for raw rum, foul talk,
and loose company.
What we want for Indian service is the seasoned man
of twenty; or, better still, one or two and twenty. But
we want short-service men at the same time. The
problem is, how to turn [all the short service term to
the good: that out of the six years we shan't have to
strike off two useless ones.
Now, why not act on Sib W. Russell's plan P Enlist
our youngsters for the embodied militia from eighteen
to twenty: give them home-drill and light home-duty
for that time, and then pass them into the home-reserve
of unembodied militia for ten or fifteen years longer, to
come up to a yearly setting-up drill and out-door
manoeuvres in the Prussian fashion for one month out of
every twelve; and let men over twenty volunteer out
of the militia for six years' service abroad, with good pay
and allowances, and a retaining fee, when they join the
second rank or the reserve, say for Bix years longer,
after they come home again.
In this way, at any rate, we should get some good
out of our Cucumbers, after dressing them.
As it is evident that John Bull's army of " Defence,
not Defiance" is still to seek, and that the most to be
expected from Mr. Card well and the Abolition of Pur-
chase Bill is that between them they may dear the
ground for the Force of the Future, Mr. Punch begs
leave, as above, to say his "ditto to Sib William
Russell."
Multum in Parvo.
These be what a Cuss must Keep,
For happiness who hankers:
Sober, single, and a balance
At his blessed Bankers'.

THE COUNCIL OF THREE.
The Three Tailors of Tooley Street who meet at the Hall of the
International Association in Holborn, have been writing to Lord
Granville and Mr. Gladstone to receive a deputation, to urge on
them the "necessity of maintaining the inviolability of the right of
asylum for political refugees in England." Mr. Gladstone's Private
Secretary writes to the Mighty Three—the Eumenides of England—
that11 Lord Granville, being in Scotland, will be unable to receive a
deputation, and cannot answer their letter, though their wishes
shall be communicated to him. As to Mr. Gladstone, he has
desired his Secretary to say that Her Majesty's Government will, no
doubt, should occasion arise, act on any power given them by the
existing law." On this, the three pass a resolution expressing
regret "at the ambiguous reply of Me. Gladstone, and the
ominous silence of the Foreign Secretary."
Where is the ambiguity in Mr. Gladstone's answer? Can there
be any mistake about its meaning? If so, Mr. Punch has great
pleasure in explaining it to his Holborn friends. "Keep to your
own business of tailoring, and leave me to mine of seeing, as head
of the Executive, to the carrying out of the Law. It is wiser and
stronger, I am happy to think, than either of us, and has placed the
question of extradition under the guardianship of justice, which is
the perfection of common sense, alike beyond the bias of palpable
partisanship and possible prejudice?"
As to the "ominous silence " of .the Foreign Secretary, only the
Three could have been unreasonable enough to insist on Lord
Granville answering the Holborn Oracle all the way from Balmoral
—nihilominus. Would it be too much to ask the Terrible Three to
wait till he comes back? En attendant, let England be thankful
that she has National Law to govern her course in such matters,
instead of "International" Liberty.

THE FUTURE OP FRANCE.
Great nations, by disaster schooled, advance:
Their greatness oft the sequel of their grief:
With hand upon the page of History, France
Is going to turn oyer a new leaf.
She means her future to redeem her past,
Eschews vain-glory, and insane desire
Of rule, renounces brag, and by bombast
Will cease, henceforth, derision to inspire.
Surrounding peoples all, so they increase
By lawful increment, she '11 leave alone,
Amongst them glad enough to live in peace,
Nor grudge them theirs, meanwhile she holds her
own.
Her children to the Good will all their hearts
Apply; with all their heads will seek the True;
They '11 chiefly cultivate the useful arts,
And the domestic virtues chiefly, too.
Her teachers will uphold the reign of Right.
Her authors and her artists, both, will try
Distinctly to enforce, with all their might,
The sacredness of marriage—by-and-by.
In manners, in amusements, in array,
France will a new example set of taste,
And soon her epigrammatists will say
That Europe is refined when France is chaste.
Their Moloch-worship Frenchmen will abjure,
Respect the Soldier in his proper sphere,
From foreign foes of keeping them secure.
Moreover, the Policeman they '11 revere.
France ne'er will fight for an Idea again;
In the world's markets only she 'IT contend.
And tell us, all ye fools who will, that then
France to meek England's level will descend.

WHITEHEAD AND SOFTHEAD.
At a recent meeting at South Shields, it was resolved, Mr. Punch
is happy to say, to have a Public Library in that distinguished
Durham borougn. But the resolution was not easily carried. There
was much unseemliness in the way of vulgar opposition. And
though the dictum of one of the opponents, a Town Councillor named
Whitehead, may be considered as compact, it will hardly be
deemed elegant. Quoth (according to the report before us) Mr.
Whitehead (whose name is reverent — and there, until further
advice, Mr. Punch's reverence for the owner ceases), "Newspapers
alone are the literature of the age, and only seedy readers read
books." We have looked out "seedy" in Webster, and we find
"exhausted, worn-out, poor, and miserable-looking." Webster
rudely adds " colloquial and low." Well, perhaps the word is so,
even though used by a Town Councillor. But what did Mr. White-
head mean, if he meant anything? After much consideration, we
arrive at the conclusion that he meant nothing except to air his
imbecility. Does he flatter himself that he can understand a news-
paper? Xo man can do that who does not read books, and a good
many of them. Let him go to bed. As Shaxspeare says (did he
ever hear of Shakspeare r—let somebody tell Mr. W. that Mr. S.
wrote a book), "A good soft pillow for that good white head were
better than "—attending at a meeting and hindering a good object.
Mr. Punch particularises a soft pillow—similia simuibus curantur.
Seal Soothsayers v. Sham.
A popular novelist writes, "There is never more roaring laughter
than at a dinner of Parsons." A classical scoffer remarks that the
British Augurs are superior to the hypocrisy admired in the Augurs
of Rome. We neutralise the scoff by retorting that an honest man's
laugh and a humbug's are as different as the laughter of Man and
of the Hyaena.
A PRIZE NECROLOGIST.
Mr. Punch has the eyes of Argus, but no Juno shall pluck them
out for the ornamentation of any peacock whatsoever. That's not
to the point. He is a regular reader of the West African Herald
(when it comes to him), and in the last number he finds this, in the
obituary:—
"At his house in Winnebah, at half-past ten a.m., on the 23rd ult., Henry
Ahquah, Kiii£ of Winnebah. The deceased was the must intelligent and
civilised chief m the protectorate, and his death will be felt as a severe loss to
the people of his districts."
He is sorry for the loss of the good king, of course, and if he had
the slightest idea where Winnebah is, he would send cards. But he
has mastered his sorrow to the extent of being able to hold up the
above paragraph as a specimen of what necrology should be. Here
is a virtuous potentate, a Scipio Africanus, who departs, and he
gets five lines in memoriam. The most worthless European Sove-
reign would have five columns. But to how few Sovereigns could
the above character be given't Miss Jellaby said in her haste that
"Africa was a Beast." But some of its inhabitants are not beasts—
they know how to value a good King, and they know how to write
about him when he goes ad majores. We compliment the W. A.
Herald.

Who is the Premier now?
Q. 3. Is he in the House of Lords or Commons?
•»* Though we say it who shouldn't—though if we didn't,
who wouldn't ?—the best information on all such important
social subjects will be obtained in the shortest possible way
by a referenoe to Mr. Punch's Pocket-Book.
Q. 4. Besides writing (recently) Lothair, what has Mr. Disraeli

season t
Q. 19. Have you ever seen the Stock Exchange? If not, where do
you think it is P

the City."
Q. 20. Where is Manchester? Is it a great commercial seaport P
Q. 21. Which were invented first, steamboats or railways?
Q. 22. Did you ever hear of taxes P What benefit does the Queen

ence to the Esquimaux country P
Q. 25. Are the Scilly Islands in the Mediterranean, or near St.
Helena P If neither one nor the other, then state where they are,
and where is St. Helena P
Q. 26. What is an Exon in Waiting?

present moment, any future possible Bishop of Exeter is
mere trifling?
Q. 27. Mention the name of any three Bishops on the Bench
besides the Bishop of Winchester?

ecclesiastical, against it? If not, what is prtemunire t
Heads of Families will do well to hold weekly General Knowledge
Examinations for the Ladies of their households, adopting the above
paper as a model.
Of course Paterfamilias would be compelled to give, also weekly,
a handsome something as a reward of merit to the first-class prize-
woman, who must immediately complain to Mr. Punch if she
doesn't get it. But Mr. Punch sincerely hopes that she may.
"WANTED, A FEW FINE ACTIVE YOUNG MEN!"
A War-Office order has directed that the_ height of recruits is to
be increased from 5 feet 44 inches to 5 feet 5 inches.
It's all very well to raise the standard, but will the recruits flock
to it? They don't so much object to the flag, but the colours they
like best are the colours of John Bull's money—the yellow of the
sovereign, and the white of the pay shilling.
"No Donnty, and no pension r—a short service, but not a merry
one!"
Hffl!—as the Chelsea Prophet says. That old fisher of men, Serjeant
Kith, might be a thundering liar, but he gorged his gudgeon.
Cardwell can't. Reoruits won't rise to his present bait. He must
try a new cast, and a fresh fly.
AGAIN ALREADY?
Has a Noble Nation not had enough of interfering with its neigh-
bours? Will it not have as much as is good for it to attempt if it
confine itself for some time to come to minding its own business?
Not so, think the Legitimists; at the offices of whose provincial
journals an address to De presented to the Pope on the 16th of June
lies for signature, terminating as follows:—
"May France, restored and regenerated, soon lend once more the aid other
avenging arm to her oppressed father."
The Bourbonists appear, like the Bourbons, to have learned
nothing, but, unlike them, to have forgotten much. Forgetful,
seemingly, of the consequences of the mistake made by a Noble
Nation in attacking United Germany, they now propose, as soon as
they are in power, that it shall assail Italian Unity. Or do they
remember the mistake well enough, but think it will not be repeated
by a Noble Nation in attacking a neighbour whom they believe to
be a weaker one? May the Noble Nation not again commit a crime,
which, if committed, will, it is to be hoped, again prove a blunder
even greater than the last.

During the late remarkable weather, the thermometer, for several

Abolished? Certainly sot, Sir. You'll have to make your Way Just

THE POLICE IN PARIS.
Why is the Council of the International Working-Men's Association like the
Pope ?—saving the Pope's Holiness. Because it has published an Encyclical;
only its Encyclical is an Address to all the Social Revolutionists in Europe and
the United StateB, expressing sympathy with the Communists who martyred
the Archbishop of Paris. This Encyclical, therefore, differs from the papal
toto coelo and—toto inferno.
It is probable that the International Working-Men, even those who form
the Council of their Association, do not see the Morning Post every day.
That is a pity, for if they did. they would have had the pleasure of reading,
in a late letter from the Posts Own Correspondent at Paris, the following
account of the present state of that Capital:—
"The gendarmes have resumed their old posts in all the splendour of their old attire, and
the familiar cocked-hat of the Parisian public officer is again becoming as common as whi n
Paris was in the height of her glory, and all the crowned monarchs Tied with each other
in 1867 in the splendour of their visits. Some fifteen thousand gendarmes and gardiens
de la paix are now in charge of Paris, two thousand five hundred of whom are mounted."
Satisfactory intelligence, Odger, eh? Good news, isn't it, Luchaft, and all the
rest of you gentlemen whose names have been published among the signatures
to the Encyclical of your GSoumenical Council P The Police are once more
supreme in Paris. Friends of Order— hooray 1
Good Resolution.
By telegram from Paris, the other day, we learned that:—
"The Academie Franchise resumed its sittings yesterday; its Dictionary will appear
this year."
Is it true that the French Academy has determined to obliterate from its
forthcoming Dictionary the word " Gtoiret"

Asa rule we disapprove of Corporal Punishment, but at this season of the year

JOHNSON'S JUMP.
'Man overboard!" A rush—a cry
That thrills the steamer's crowded freight!
He rises—sinks—no rope is nigh—
The life-buoy—save him! 'Tis too late!
No! From the Bridge's central height,
A dark form flashes through the air,
The cloven water leaps in light—
There was but one, now two are there!—
A swimmer, skilful, swift, and strong.
And one he swims with, still and pale—
From boat and bridge rise, loud and long.
The shouts that saved and saviour hail!
And all is question and reply—
And scarce at length the truth we learn:
For bravery is proud and shy,
Slow to take thanks, as quick to earn.
'Tis J. B. Johnson death has braved—
From Leeds—he lives by the trapeze:
'Tis Captain Peters he has saved,
From the West End—"There! Btow your praise—
Next time be readier with a rope—
What if to save life be his whim?
Reward be blowed! For that he '11 hope.
Winning the mateh he's here to swim."
So should true courage waive its claim
To praise and penoe, and go its way;
'Tis only in the meed of fame
The hero earns the hero's pay.
On the trapeze when " Iza swings—
So J. B. Johnson's name is " billed "—
What wonder if a house he brings
WTith curious admirers filled?
If, when he swims, around the wave,
Applauding crowds in thousands tell
How life he risked, a life to save.
So should bear off both cup and bell.
Give J. B. Johnson cup and bell,
But cap and bells keep for John Bull,
Who to be gulled submits so well,
Knaves scarce can choose but make him fool.
The chorus has not died away
That rings round Johnson s gallant deed—
The hero still pulls in the pay,
That praise, with us, is apt to breed,—
When, lo, the saviour and the saved,
'Tis whispered, both bear Johnson's name;
Fall, leap, life rescued, drowning braved,
Are only Johnson Brothers' game!
Peter and J. B. both can jump,
Peter and J. B. both can swim:
What if P., overboard should plump,
J. B. from bridge spring after him?
How J. B. Johnson's name would draw,
How Peter Johnson's tap would fill!
Ducking and dive—an eight days' jaw,
And a year's profit in the till!
And so the little game was planned.
And so the little game was played:
And Johnson's name rang through the land,
And in the bills sensation made.
Be warned, John Bull, and ere again
You let your soft old heart go thump.
At some deed of heroio strain,
Take care 'tis not a Johnson's Jump.
There's many a Peter over goes,
To be picked up by his J. B.,
Where both are equal shams and shows—
The peril and the bravery.
Where though no hat is handed round,
A heavier shot John Bull must stand;
His praise discounted at per pound,
And Fame's notes changed for notes of hand.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
O PPOS1T I Off. ^\

he fact is, that when Lokd Russell likes to speak, he
always says something which wise men like to hear.
But for some reason, which may be a good one,
for that Earl is [not aocustomed to aot unreasonably, ne takes
the utmost care to be, for the most part, inaudible. He chose
to be so to-night, Monday, June 12, but he was understood to be
strongly objecting to the American Treaty. It was defended by
Lord Granville, and acoepted by Lord Derby, though he did
not hugely admire it. Lord de Grey (who is to be made a marquis
for his services in negotiating it) vindicated the oourse of the British
diplomatists, and complimented Ms. Fish. Lord Catens thought
that the Treaty ought to be ratified, and Lord Salisbury thought
that all we had got by it was the advantage of calming the sensi-
bilities of the American people, whom our Government persisted in
treating as the spoiled child in the nursery of nations. An impor-
tant subject was discussed in a befitting manner, which is to be
regretted, as no scope was afforded for diverting treatment of the
debate.
However, the Commons made amends but first, Mr. Punch
desires to call attention to a little speech by the Great Master of
Language. Sir Roundell Palmer had put on the paper an elabo-
rate question about the above-mentioned Treaty, a question that
reads like a Chancery interrogatory, and contains about five-and-
twenty lines without a full stop. To which Mr. Gladstone an-
swered :—
"I observe that the queBtion uses words selected with great care, and those
words have also been carefully considered by us in order to avoid entering into
any details in replying to the question, because I can assure him by a simple
affirmative that the understanding expressed in that question is the under-
standing which Her Majesty's Government attach to the rule inquired
about."
If anything can be neater than this, or if anybody ever saved
himself trouble more elegantly, Mr. Punch would like to know the
instance.
Then came the eternal Army Bill. But there was deviation from
the ordinary dulness, and iterations by
."—Milton.
"Captain, and Colonel, and Knight in
Government having discovered that there was no particular chance
of carrying the Bill in its entirety, solemnly Divided it in two, gave
to the winds the Organisation portion (except as regards the taking
away the power of Lords Lieutenant), and announced that it was
only absolutely necessary to carry the Abolition of Purchase. Mr.
Disraeli was, of course, suddenly filled with impromptu dismay,
and had been caused a certain degree of humiliation by the want of
candour and ingenuousness on the part of the Government. Mr.
Gladstone comforted him with much assiduity, and by the end of
the debate Mr. Disraeli was as well as could be expected, consider-
ing that he had been suffering all day from the knowledge, shared
by everybody else, that this oourse was going to be taken.
There was a deal of smart talk, of course, chiefly at the expense of
the Cabinet, which had so much difficulty in getting its cart uphill,
that it had thrown out nearly all the luggage taken up at the
beginning of the Session. "Is this all that I am to have for all the
money I am to ask that gentleman for ?" will be Britannia's query,
as she points at the Income-tax payer. However, we must take
what we can get, and Mb. Gladstone, as the Pioneer of the British
Army, must now hew his way through the enchanted forest of
Military Tested Interests.
After an announcement by Mb. Bruce that nothing is to be done
about the Game Laws this year, we had store Army debates, and
divers divisions, whereof Mr. Ptmeh means to say only that the
Marquis of Lorne, M.P. lor Argyllshire, appeared in his place, was
heartily congratulated by friends, and v«ted with his august
mother-in-law's Government.
Lobd Justice Christian, of Ireland, learned Judge, and some-
time Liberal Minister, has astonished divers by discovering and
giving judgment to the effect, that the Irish Land Act—the great
work of a recent Session, does not give the Ulster Tenant the security
which it certainly was intended to give. He would recognise no
such tenant-right, and described the intention as one of confiscation.
He is stated to have used language of exeeeding severity in reference
to the Aot, and the objects of its authors; but he desires it to be
understood that he is incorrectly reported. However, so important
was his decision, that, long before the week was out. Lord Catens
brought in a Bill for declaring the Ulster rights; and perhaps the
Conservative scoff at the cleverness of those who did not frame
their statute so as to effect their intentions may be pardonable.
But we shall never have good laws until they are edited. Editing
is the greatest invention in the world.
The Army, and India, occupied the Commons; and on the latter
subject Mr. Fawcett and Mr. Grant Duff had some sharp words,
and of course, on another night, they professed the utmost regard
for one another. What was the subject? 0! nothing particular.
Mr. Fawcett thinks that Indian finance is abominably managed,
and all the natives groan under oppression; and Mb. Ctkant Duff
thinks that it is managed admirably, and that India is a reproduc-
tion of Paradise, with improvements.
Tuesday. The Dissenters triumphed over Lord Salisbury. The
House of Lords, by a large majority, too, 129 to 89, agreed with the
Commons in rejecting the Marquis's new University Tests, and
Lord Salisbury, like a gentleman, gave up all his other points,
instead of contesting them against the feeling of the House. There-
fore let there be joy in Jireh, shouting in Salem, laughter in Little
Bethel, ecstasy in Ebenezer, bumptiousness in Bethesda, and zest in
Zoar, for the last of the Dissenting grievances (save onelis taken
away, and the young Non-oonformist may go up into the Universi-
ties, and crown himself with all carnal glory. Nor shall the Dis-
senters rejoice alone, for Mr. Punch shall partake their joy, believ-
ing that the abolition of such Tests is a right and wise thing.
Mourn not, dear old Mother Church, for thou shalt thus obtain
many new children, many of a bright sort. Dost believe, dear old
lady, that those who have dwelled with the stately Graces of thine
old Colleges will be content to go back to Dowdyism P Thou'lt see.
We shall have a Calvinistic Eight on the water one of these days,
pulling like mad against High Church and Broad Church, and after-
wards fraternising with the orthodox, and drinking pale ale, as if
Calvin had never burned Servetus.
Wednesday. The Commons deolined by 222 to 64 to interfere with
religious education in endowed schools, and the Government pro-
mised, to consider during the recess, a scheme for improving medical
education. And, note, the Bill for Repealing the Ecclesiastical
Titles Act was passed. Mr. Punch respectfully salutes the Arch-
bishop of Westminster, and does so in a chivalrous spirit, because
the repeal is not yet Law.
Thursday. Lord Westbury, in an effective speech, called atten-
tion to the shameful arrears in our Great Appeal Court. The way is
choked up, and Her Majesty's subjects can get no justice.
Australia is angry, India is indignant, and with reason. Lord
Westbury insisted in having a remedy in ten days, which demand
took the Chancellor's breath away, but he managed to promise to
do Something.
Thanks to Mr. W. H. Smith, Member for Westminster, the Go-
vernment has come to a sense of the error of its ways in trying to
prig—yes, Prig—part of the Thames Embankment, for the Crown.
The Queen is the last personage to wish for anything which is not
rightfully hers, and when we say the Crown, we mean an Abstrac-
tion, for which this abstraction of land was intended. The Govern-
ment cannot exactly say that they were going to do a wrong thing,
so a Select Committee is to be appointed, and that will, we hope,
say it. Mr. Smith deserves the gratitude of London for his exer-

tions, but Mr. Punch hereby more than repays them by taking off
bis hat to the Honourable Member.
Our friend, Mr. Peter Taylor, if he will allow us to call him so
(though we hardly know why he should), has "struck ile" this
time, and has hold, not of a doubtful grievance about some two-
penny criminal, but of a real grievance, the persecution of little
tradesfolk, by Mr. Bee Wright, for selling necessaries on Sunday.
This Bee Wright writes himself "Reverend," but was a shoe-
maker. [To Correspondents.—All jokes about vexing the soles of
the poor; sticking to his last; robbing the helpless of their awl;
and so on, are rejected in advance, and. the addresses of the senders
will be given to the Mendicity Society, with a view to investiga-
tions.] The Act of Charles the Merry legally justifies proceed-
ings which would be ludicrous, were they not oppressive. Mr.
Taylor desires to repeal that Act, but as there will hardly be time
for that in a wasted Session, he proposes to suspend the law for a
year. One of Wright's amiable witnesses was fined by Mr. Knox,
the other day, for being excessively drunk, but we can't have all
the virtues at once, and if we are good Sabbatarians we may be
allowed to be tipsy. Eh, Caledonia? Your health in a dram.
Army; and—Prayer-Book, that is to say, Table of Lessons Bill.
'' Who asked for any change r" grumbled Mb. Henley, who further
stated that when we go into certain churches, "we don't know
whether we are standing on our head or our heels." We have not
experienced this singular ecclesiastical sensation, as yet, but hope to
do so. There was some unprofitable talk over the Bill, but it went
through Committee. Parents of god-children are requested te con-
tinue indulgent, the beautiful Prayer-Books will come in time.
Friday. Her Majesty "willed"the Westmeath Outrages Bill
and the University Tests Bill—both measures for abolishing un-
wholesome compacts.
Touching English prisoners in Paris, nine are still detained, and
the evil boy, Robert Lowe, has been set free. Let his incarceration
be a warning to him never again to fight a whole French army.
There was a very hot squabble over the Business of the House,
remarkable only for Mr. Berbhford Hope's definition of a Count
Out. He said that it was a sacred thing, which gave Members the
privilege of being allowed to save their own lives.
In Supply, there was fight over a vote of £1562 for Queen's
Plates in Ireland. Some Members wished these done away, bat
even Mr. Bottvebtje contended that they did good, and attracted
farmers and others to harmless meetings, totally unlike the assem-
blage of betting men and other blackguards who swarm on the
English race-courses.
Mb. Chabley's Protestantism boils over at the Catholic lotteries
in aid of charity. The misceUaneous lots of prizes seem sordid and
odd enough, but the proceedings are fair, and the money does good.
Mr. Bruce reserved the right of toleration, and the House supported
him by 60 to 33.
Naturally, towards one in the morning, the question of Drinks
was raised, and there were various suggestions offered as to the best
way of preventing the vicious from sotting, while the virtuous
should not be hindered from refreshing. It seems that there are
more arrests for drunkenness than there used to be, but this is be-
cause the drink-house people being more afraid to harbour the

CRIMTNAL LITERATURE AND ART.
Thebe is a certain newspaper of which the readers appear to be,
most of them, persons who read and write imperfectly, and are in a
fair way to get themselves entered as such in a list wont to be made
out in institutions belonging to Her Majesty, and supported by
the County Rates. This publication is caUed the Police News. The
news which it contains consists chiefly of the details of acts which
the vocation of the Police is to prevent, or to apprehend those who
commit them; that is to say, criminal acts of violence, inclusive of
suicides. These, its contents, are illustrated by a sheet of wood-
cuts adapted to the very meanest capacity, as though with
intent to assist savages endowed with imagination in one degree
above a gorilla, to form some conception of the physical details of a
horrid murder, a brutal assault, or some other atrocity.
The literature and art of the Police News of course mainly depend
upon the facts which it derives from the Assize and Police Reports
and the Coroners' Inquests. In a dearth of extremely revolting
incidents, it is sometimes reduced to the description and delineation
of very commonplace offences, which may even be hypothetical.
One of its late numbers contained a print, representing an " Alleged
Attempt to Shoot an Actress." This allegation having turned out
to be a mistake, the picture of it was a representation of a deed
which was never done at all; an illustration of fictitious intelligence.
What a peculiar order of minds must those be that are capable of
deriving any amount of satisfaction from the rudest of designs,
when the crime that they are meant to signify is a
matter of fact, are themselves conjectural! How exactly on a par
must be the imaginative faculty and the intellect of such minds
with the moral sense, and the taste!
Should the Btate of Society, in spite of the Police News and its
kindred literature, undergo such an amelioration as would be evi-
denced by the general occurrence of Maiden Assizes, still that pretty
paper would be enabled, by carrying out the principle on which it
narrates and delineates "alleged" attempts, to go on entertaining
the vilest of the remaining vile. For example, it could present its
readers, as often as it liked, with an illustrated narrative of a
"Reported Execution of a Supposed Murderer," or a "Whipping
which a Garotter was Sentenced to Reoeive."
BARLEYCORN AND BURNS.
In a letter to the Times on " Beer Statistics," our friend Dawson
BURNS observes that comparatively little malt is used in this country
in the manufacture of ardent spirits. Too true. Potatoes are used,
and other things which yield spirits of an impure and noxious
quality. Mr. Bubns would promote the cause of Temperance by
■ 1 iri i ting agitation on behalf thereof towards obtaining a statute to
secure the preparation of potable spirits from proper materials. He
would then make a name for himself in connection with sound and
wholesome exciseable liquors, such as cheer but not inebriate in
moderate quantities, and publicans would advertise "Dawson
Burns's Pure British Brandy, and Genuine Old Tom." Even the
produce of John Barleycorn m the land of Burns himself would be
commended to customers under the denomination of "Burns
(Diwson)'s Whiskey." People who drank the real "barley bree"
would be "na that fou" after any amount of it that they make
a very Httlc base and counterfeit whiskey.

With Compliments to Hawarden Castle.
A Welsh Grammarian sends us a conundrum. As a Scotch lady
said of a sermon, "Wad we hae the presumption to understand it?'
It is this. Why is Mr. Gladstone like a Welsh Apposition Pro-
noun? "Because when he is marked by emphasis, ne retains his
Radical and strong form."
The Fruit Market.
In the time of Louis Philippe, it was a question of about "the
Pear not being ripe yet." But we suppose this coming summer (if
ever it does come ?) will prove what kind of a show will be made
this year with the Orleans Plum.

Here are good and ill; but more ill than good. It is good to see

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MY HEALTH.
Y Cousin John From
Sea has arrived, and
we've had a day of
him. I retire to my
room to meditate,
principally on Cou-
sin John From Sea,
and make this note.
John is, undoubt-
edly, 1 am obliged
to own it, a success.
I mean as regards
my Aunt and DOD-
DRIDGE. Not With
me; because though
I admit that he is
tall, handsome, with
a genial manner, yet
I do not like boister-
□sity, by which I
mean a perauns
being perpetually
boisterous. This is
the very last thing
I should have tried
with my Aunt.
John doesn't try it;
he comes, does it,
and conquers. Here
have I been with my Aunt for weeks at Kamsgate, during the most
unfashionable and unseasonable time, adapting myself not only to
her peculiarities but to those of Doddridge, her maid, her ring-dove
and Tier lap-dog with bells, listening sympathetically to her music,
trying to weep, nay, sometimes weeping when she wept, controlling
my temper and reducing myself to a fearfully nervuun state of
repressed irritability, refusing to drive out with Bddd (except once),
and, in faot, making myself in a general way, as it were, one of
themselves," and at the end of the time I feel that there is a gulf
between my Aunt and myself; that we, as it were, form two com-
paratively hostile camps, one containing my Aunt (generalissimo),
Doddridge, Dove and Dog; and the other myself, in anything but
full force. I have tried to suit my conversation to my oompany; I
have been mildly cheerful, I have been serious, I have been quaker-
ishly gay, I have suppressed anything like untimely mirth, and am
evidently quite unappreciated, perhaps regarded as a nuisance.
John arrives. Tremendous knock. Rushes down the passage.
Runs into sitting-room, gives my Aunt a slap on the back and a kiss,
and says "Hallo, old gal!"
She doesn't jump, scream, kick, nor indeed appear the least sur-
prised. If / had done such a thing, she'd have burst into lavish tears
and but there 1 couldn't have done it.
Query. Shall I begin a new line now and try?
"Hallo, old Doddy !" he cries, on the appearance of that respect-
able maiden, Doddbidge, who quite beams under the salutation and
replies, " 0, Master John, you re just as bad as ever, I do declare."
My Cousin John From Sea addresses both my Aunt and Doddridge
as old gal," and has a great deal to say about flagships, the
Mediterranean, Gibraltar, the fellows at mess, and has apparently
endless stories of the fun they had wherever they were stationed.
Getting John quiet, I try to obtain from him some information
as to naval matters, as for instance, watches at sea, keeping look-
out, to what rank in the Army a boatswain is equivalent, also
questions concerning hammocks, cabooses, and the general domestic
economy of a ship, with whioh as a landsman I confess myself totally
unacquainted.
Strange to say that if there is one thing about which Cousin John
From Sea appears to know nothing, it is about ships, shipping, and
naval and marine affairs generally. He has no stories about Satur-
day night at sea, and how they sit round the galley fire and sing
and dance to the music of the black cook's fiddle. He (Cousin John,
I mean), has not been all over the world, and lived a roving seafaring
life, but, on the contrary, all his stories of the fun he hashad might
be told by a oountry squire who has never gone out of his own
inland county, or by a Londoner who has invariably kept within
hearingof Bow bells. (Query. Can Bow bells be heard in St. James's
Street, Bond Street, or Belgravia? If not, what are the exact limits ?)
Cousin John's being at sea, is to my mind, a humbug. He's
always been, by his own showing, on shore.
He begins a story with, "When we were in the Mediterranean."
Then he turns towards me, and explains, "We were in the Mediter-
ranean for three years "—and I nod encouragingly, as much as to
say, "Proceed; your story interests me much;" for I am expecting
to hear some fearful tale of shipwreck, or some gallant adventure
with pirates, or large fish, or whatever there may be unusual or
startling during a three years' cruise about the Mediterranean. But
not a bit of it. His story (addressed to my Aunt, who is much in-
terested, and quite sprightly) generally continues in this style: "I
met the Cubzons." Not shot an albatross, or engaged with bucca-
neers, or suppressed a mutiny by craftily securing all the ruffians
under hatches, and then steering the ship by himself for nights and
days, until she came safely into port, where he had all the crew hung.
No, nothing of that sort, out simply, "When he (Cousin John From
Sea) was in the Mediterranean ... he met the Cubzons!!" Just
as he might have done in Hyde Park or Pall Mall on any one day,
that is, provided always that the Cubzons were there, and not in the
Mediterranean. My Aunt is, however, quite delighted, and imme-
diately asks after various members of the Cubzon family.
As I can't believe that this sums up the entire events of three
years in the Mediterranean—{Note, because, if so, Cousin John had
better write Annalt of an Uneventful Life, in one very small
volume, price sixpence at most)—I try to draw him out, when my
Aunt has finished her examination about the Citrzons, and remind
him that "he was saying ' When he was in the Mediterranean '—
well, what then?"
•'It beeame rather slow at last," he replies, "but we had some
good fun. Of course we were rather hard up for hunting in the
winter, but we got some good shooting, and there were dinners and
balls and parties every day in the i«eek, until one was really quite
sick of them."
"You hunt much?" I bastard, because I had always thought that
a sailor on horseback was an impossibility or an utter absurdity.
"Yes," he replies in an off-hand way, "I had a bad time of it
last season, because I 'd sold Old Tantrum. You recollect Old
Tantrum > he says, turning to my Aunt. She does, and smiles as
if much gratified at being appealed to on such a question.
"I say, old gal," he suddenly exclaims, jumping up, "let's have
a drive this afternoon. I '11 get a trap, and take you out. You
want a jolt, it '11 do you good. We '11 haw a dog-cart, and you"
(to me) "can hold Doddy on behind."
Whereat Doddy simpers, and says, "Lor! how you oo go on,
Master John!"
The next thing John wants to know is " If there ain't any nke
young women—present company always excepted," he say*, winking
at me (more simpers from my Aunt this time, and Doddridge
chuckling)—" who'd like to have a hop in the evening? I say, old
gal," he continues, sitting down on the sofa, and putting his arm
round my Aunt, "we must have a hop," and he actually induces
myAunt to enter into a discussion on the subject.
He pretends to run up-stairs after Doddridge in order to give her
a kiss. He asks my Aunt for a song, and she "obliges" with
Longing to Die, which Cousin John immediately characterises as
"a cheery sort of ditty," and asks her if she doesn't know anything
a trifle more dismal. She is not in the least annoyed; on the con-
trary, she tries to recollect something lively, but fails. He asks her
to accompany him in a nigger song with some such inane chorus as
"Flip up in de Skidamajink, jube up in de juben jube," and pro-
poses to teach Doddridge the bones. Charlie, hearing the music,
begins howling, whereupon Cousin John's attention being thus
attracted to him, he takes him suddenly up by the tail, to see, he
says, if he's thoroughbred; as if he is, he won't squeal. He is
evidently not thoroughbred. All my Aunt says to him is, "0,
John, you '11 hurt him," whereas if I'd touched a hair of his tail,
or had refused to give him a tit-bit, my Aunt would have burst into
tears, perhaps had a fit, Doddridge would have sobbingly reproached
me with unkindness to my Aunt, and I should have been made
nervous and wretched for an hour at least, but Cousin John From
Sea may smoke, vault over the table (he actually does so), play leap-
frog over the chairs (which he also does whenever he says he thinks
we re a little dull, and want waking up, generally inviting
Doddridge to give him a back), smack my Aunt, punoh my Aunt,
laugh at her songs, make her pet dog squeak with rage, let the
dove out of the cage to walk about (when it flies to the mantel-piece
and breaks an ornament), and not only is nothing said to him by
way of remonstrance, but he is absolutely encouraged by my Aunt s
smiles, and Doddridge's admiring exclamations of "Ain't he
lively, Mum?" "0, Master John, how you do go on!"
I am certainly in the back-ground. I at once take rank as it were
after—or rather some way be! low—Cousin John, and begin looking
up to him. He is bent upon taking the "Old Gals out for a
drive, and so I accompany him into the town to the Livery Stables,
to ask for a trap and two ponies.
Thoughts as I walk along by the side of Cousin John.—Odd. He
was so noisy in the house, that I thought he'd be a charming com-
panion here, when he had dropped his nonsensical humour, which I
take for jrranted he has assumed just to enliven my Aunt with a
little buffoonery. Now we are alone, he will be sensible. He can
inform me what the ships are out at sea. [N.B. That's the beauty
of Ramsgate, such a heap of shipping. There's always a steamer
or two going out or coming in on its own account, or assisting other

manned, and always ready for action in the direction of the fatal

instance, my Cousin John, who being from sea, I may look upon as
a professional person with peculiar knowledge.]

the way, 1 can't help remarking that he is dressed in the height of

tell him I want to go to the library to order a book. "Ah!" he says,

"No, not always." I suppose this is the character he's heard of me.
Ho continues, I'm not much of a bookist, so I'll just pop into
the stables close by, and you come on."
We part. On the steps of the library I suddenly feel a sort of
shooting pain from my shoulder to my elbow, and an ache in my
knee. By the way, Cousin John's visit has brought under my
notice something which I have not remarked in myself before. He
can run up the steps of our cliff without stopping once, and then
walk briskly on. I can't. I have to pause three times, (generally
on pretence of admiring the view,) and rather feel as if I'd swallowed

PUNCH'S OWN CROSIER.
"With reference to the Ecclesiastical Courts Bill proposed by the
Earl of Shaftesbury,
the Post remarks on the
importance of the question,
"how far Loed Shaftes-
buey's Bill may be im-
proved by carrying out the
Bishop of Winchestee's
suggestion to strengthen
the hands of the Bishops
in dealing with the most
painful cases of breaches
by Clergymen of the moral
law." When Bisnor Wil-
berforce desires the
Bishops' hands to be
strengthened, of course he
wishes more power to their
elbows. At present a
Bishop's crosier ls^no better
than a beadle's staff; it is
simply what Cromwell
called the Speaker's mace.
The painful breaches of
the moral law, of which
some Clergymen are some-
times culpable, would
doubtless in some cases be
most suitably corrected by
the infliction of a corre-
sponding chastisement with
such an instrument as a
Bishop's crosier, wielded by
a Bishop whose hands had
been strengthened suffi-
ciently to enable him to lay
it on with a will. Then
the crosier, ceasing to be a
bauble, would assume the
character of a consecrated
cudgel, which is what it
may be supposed to have
formerly had by those who
consider the manner in
which mediaeval Bishops
are represented in many
contemporary illumina-
tions as holding it, and
compare that with the way
in which another kind of
staff is held by the Hero
of a popular hypsethral
drama. There was, you
know, a certain disci-
pline in primitive times for
the open correction of no-
torious offenders; and if
the hands of Bishops were
so strengthened that a
Bishop could apply his
crosier to that purpose, the
said discipline would effec-
tually be restored again;
"which," not a few people
may now and then be in-
clined to think, "ismuch to
be wished." Rooi-too-ooi!
Portable Pillow.
Amongst the particulars
of " Fashions for June," Le
Follelspecifies "HairroUed
back over a cushion." Your
cushion to its right use—
but is that for the head?
A cushion at the poll in ad-
dition to a chignon would,
one imagines, seriously
augment top - heaviness;
though, to be sure, it might
serve to break a fall. But a
cushion so situated is a mis-
nomer—call it a pillow.
A PHOTOGRAPHIC THIEF-TRAP.
A respected Contemporary thus enables us to wish success to
"Photography as a De-
tective. — Certain photo-
graphs exist of the ruins of
theVendome Column, in which
the portraits of a number of
National Guards, in triumphal
attitudes, are plainly recog-
nisable. Each of those heads,
after haying been enlarged,
has now been placed in the
hands of the detective police.
A series of views of the prin-
cipal barricades also were pub-
lished just before the troops
entered Paris, and several
hundred portraits of insur-
gents are given. The like-
nesses will in many cases lead
to the condemnation of the
men so depicted."
Is it not possible to con-
struct a photographic trap
so contrived that, when a
spring connected with it is
trodden on, a screen shall
be raised and lowered after
an interval long enough to
admit the formation of an
image on the camera P
That image might be the
image of a thief, who,
coming to steal where the
trap had been set, had un-
consciously trodden on the
spring, and so got photo-
graphed. An addition to
this trap, striking a mag-
nesium light simulta-
neously with the rise of
the screen, would render
it available by night as
well as by day, generally
with the advantage of
arresting the thief for a
moment in a striking atti-
tude of terror, before he
made off. Should any in-
genious mechanist reduce
this idea of a Photographic
Thief-trap to a practical
shape, he will contribute
towards furthering the
ends of justice.
Street literature.
"Literary.—To Authors.—
MSS. of every description can
be forwarded for inspection,

What a strange place to
deposit manuscript works
in—a channel! Let us
hope some useful informa-
tion will be picked up.
Matter now and then gets
into print which if it were
left in a gutter and never
published at all, the world
would be gainers rather
than losers.
GREAT SAVING OF LABOUR.
The International Ex-
hibition contains a ma-
chine which will be in-
valuable to stenographers,
penny-a-liners, ladies who
write long letters, and
some of our very produc-
tive novelists—it is called
a " Scribbler."

He goes on Board the Iosa. The only Drawback to his perfect Enjoyment is the Jealousy caused among all the
Gentlemen by the Ladies clustering round him on all Occasions.
SABBATARIAN PROGRESS.
The Sunday Closing Bill's referred
To a Select Committee.
We view concession to absurd
Fanaticism with pity.
The Sabbatarian votes are some
Vital, upon occasion,
To those who, therefore, must succumb
To Liberty s invasion.
But is that snuffling Sect to stop
The citizen's excursion
On Sundays, his refreshment-shop
Through closing by coercion?
Nay; when the Innocents fall flat
I n massacre, much rather
Perish must that vexatious Brat
Which oalls a Rylands father.
Dog-Bills and Sunday-Bills to rule
A tutored British nation!
As though for little boys at school
Is that your legislation?
On things of moment, moon by moon,
Whilst you 're in vain debating:
You '11 have the school in uproar soon,
And then you '11 get a slating.
Our Divided Enemies.
The Communists of Clerkenwell and the Irish Fenians are at odds.
Their difference is a mighty pretty quarrel as it stands, but might
be much prettier. It woula be the prettiest quarrel in the world if
they were only to fight it out like the Kilkenny Cats.
A FEATHER, IN THE CIVIC CAP.
RoiiAitvs suu avis was a proud boast; but that of being a citizen
of London is a prouder. The Lord Mayor and Corporation have
caused Mr. Punch to exult in the habitation of 85, Fleet Street.
The newspapers have announced that, both the Government and the
House of Commons having failed in taking any practical steps
towards arresting enclosures of Epping Forest, the aid of the Corpo-
ration of London has been invoked when other aid there was none;
and that:—
"The result is that the Corporation, as copyholders of Wanstead, have
through their Commissioner* of Sowers served notice upon Lord Cowley's
trustees, his steward, and agents, in reference to tho present attempted
enclosure of 30 acres on Wanstead Flats, requiring that all the fences and
gates recently erected be forthwith removed. This is the commencement of
proceedings to test the right of the lord to enclose without the sanction of
Parliament."
Gog and Magog to the rescue of Epping Forest! The City giants
have nobly answered that appeal. Their clubs are about the ears of
Lord Cowley and his creatures: let us hope to their confusion. If
they triumph, the Mayoralty of Lord Mayor Daktn will have been
made glorious for ever. The Chief Magistrate of the City of London
and his brother magistrates will have shown themselves capable of
dealing with offenders who had defied both the Cabinet and the
Legislature. The Corporation will have afforded a reason for its
perpetual existence. As it is it has undertaken a public service of
which the performance could be obtained neither from Ministers
nor Parliament. Thank Jupiter we have a Corporation of London!
Seasonable.
A Correspondent, whose name and address we withhold, because
his mental condition is evidently seriously affected by the weather,
writes to ask us to tell him of any quarter or street in London, called
after one of the months of the year, beside Mayfair, and suggests as
another suitable name of the same sort—Junewet.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
-------- \\\V%

to
onday, June 19th. Mr. Punch is not in the habit ot
making apologies, for any apparent eccentricity in
his conduct merely indicates Genius, and if people do
not at first understand it, they do well to meditate
and ponder , until comprehension arrives. But this
week something induces him to depart from his usual loftiness; perhaps
the E. winds of so-called June are too much for him. He begs—no,
takes leave to state that having heard of nothing for the last month
but the Great Tichborne Case, the details of that investigation have
so saturated his brain, that he brings them in upon all occasions,
fitting or not. "Wife, children, governess, secretary, neighbour at
'■1 J f—— j !_ —J /_ a _ r
Handel Festival, delightful young lady at the Rose Show, disagree
able ditto at the classical concert, and everybody else with whom
Mr. Punch comes in social contact, "talks Claimant." Vox
Clamanth everywhere. Therefore, if with his Parliamentary history
he mixes up echoes of this intolerable case, he docs not mean to be
irrelevant, but really the circumstances must be their own excuse.
On this Monday night Lord DENBIGH objected to the Declaration
of Paris. He wants Britannia to rule the waves a good deal more,
and search neutrals for enemies' goods. Lord Granville said that
if we had exercised such a right—to which we have no right—we
should have had our own vessels perpetually overhauled by the
French during the late war. Still, if the Claimant could not say
what a quadrangle was, and did not know the meaning of the Pons
Asinorum, that is no reason why—there we go! Well, nothing was
done; but there seems a sort of irregular idea that if we find our-
selves in war, and it is too hot to be pleasant, we shall resume our
old rights, Declaration notwithstanding: a most objectionable way of
looking at the matter.
Mr. Torrens thinks that no recruit, cavalry or line, should go
abroad till he is 20. If Sir Roger Tichborne had not gone abroad
pardon—the Government promised that no one under that age
should go to India, so the proposal was negatived in a house of 18
Members. There was debate about Militia Barracks, and the
Claimant stated that he knew the duties of an orderly officer, and
the Government got only 176 to 174. The Commons agreed with
the Lords Amendments to the Trades Unions Bill, which is made
more stringent, forbidding picketting. The Claimant complained
that he had been a good deal spied upon, butthe Solicitor-General
declined to be offended at the allegation.
Tuesday. There was discussion over tho Burials Bill, and the
Bishop of Winchester spoke very well on this last Dissenting
grievance. If the Claimant was really educated as a Catholic, as
he asserts, there would be—the Bill was forwarded, and noble Lords
do not seem to share the apprehensions of noble Commons that
English mourners would behave indecorously in a churchyard.
A good many Civil Service votes were taken. As to the photo-
graphs sent home by the Claimant to the Ortons, no doubt there is
room for considerable Me. Fawcett carried a motion to prevent
more felling of timber in the New Forest.
Wednesday. Mr. Rtlands, the Didactic, wished to shut up
public-houses on Sundays, and perhaps it would have been better
lor the Claimant's health if all public-houses had been shut up in
Australia on that sacred day and all other days, but the House
rejected the proposal by 147 to 119. But Mr. Bruce intends to try
another fall with a Pensive Public, and to limit the hours on Sunday
to those between 1 and 3 and 5 and 8. There will be much discon-
tent about this, and the barristers in court evinced much discontent
that people crowding to see the Claimant made entrance for the
Profession difficult.
Thursday. Lord Shaetesbury withdrew his Ecclesiastical Courts
Bill, which seems to be a pity, as it contained some useful things.
Ballot was introduced in the Commons, by the Government. It
is used in Australia, where the Claimant comes from, but does not
appear to work particularly well there. Before the regular debate,
Mr. Lowther wanted the Committee to redistribute four vacant
seats, but Mr. Gladstone opposed this, and managed to say some-
thing which gave Mr. Disraeli a chance of attacking him, declaring
that the Premier wanted to reopen the question of the Franchise.
This sort of thing Mr. Disraeli compared to the giving the Liberals
a dram to revive their spirits, and he warned folks against the evils
of dram-drinking, to which tho Claimant was at one time, he says,
too much addicted. Mr. Hardy saw a "visible shudder" in the
Liberal ranks at the idea of new reforms. Mr. Lowther was beaten
by 234 to 145, and Mr. Cross then opened fire on the Ballot Bill,
and debate was adjourned, as the Claimant's case will be, if not
ended in a few days.
Friday. There were desultory debates on Civil Estimates, but our
friend Mr. Whalley was as much tho hero of the House as the
Claimant is the hero in the CP. The honourable anti-Catholic
began by demanding whether the Queen had sent a congratulation
to the Pope on his jubilee. Being informed that it was so, he pon-
dered for some time, and later, when the House got on artillery, he
began again about the Pope, and there was a good deal of fun, until
the Members (who are luckier than the jurymen in the Claimant's
case, and can get away when they please, or are displeased) observ-
ing Mr. Whalley rise once more, made, says the Daily News, V a
sudden rush out of the House," leaving only about 31 present. Sp
there was an end of that matter. As the gentlemen went up the
street, they were all heard to be discussing the Claimant's case, and
offering bets as to the result. Mr. Punch rushed home to bed, and
found that his valet had laid the P. M. Gazette on the pillow, and
had opened it at the page containing the latest news of the Claim-
ant's case. He went to sleep and dreamed that he was a Kangaroo.
MY HEALTH.
The time approaches when I must take leave of my Aunt.
I regret this, as Samuel informs me that " Now de season come
on, Sar, it just de very weather for a bath. Never is such a time for
Naytchar as de summar, Sar. But, dar," he adds, resignedly, " dat's
just de way wid you genelmen—eddicated genelmen, as I'd ha'
thought 'ad known better—they go away just when de bath begin
to do 'em good. Don't say," he concludes, with most impressive
earnestness, "don't say when you go away and get ill, and have de
cold and de cramp and de rheuniatiz—don't say that it's Samuel's
fault; that's all. This condition is a sort of stipulation which he
insists upon, in order to bring himself, as it were, to even the most
unwilling agreement to my departure.
I foresee that saying farewell to my Aunt will be painful. There
will be a scene. Perhaps she'll regret mo when I'm away. If
Cousin John From Sea only stops long enough, and slaps her suffi-
ciently on the back, I'm sure she will. To be slapped on the back
may be all very well for a few days, as a novelty, out I think she '11
tire of it in a fortnight.
I am particularly kind—making a point of it—to Charlie, the lap-
dog, during my last hours here. I give him almond-biscuits and
cream. He immediately acquires a taste for these luxuries, and in
our absence he makes himself master of the contents of the biscuit-
tin and cream-jug on the table. The consequence is, that he is
seized with a dreadful attack of biliousness; he lies on the sofa
(when I enter to say good-bye) gasping, and my Aunt and Dod-
dridge are kneeling by his side.
"0 Master George!" exclaims the handmaiden—I swear there
never was such a sycophant as Old Doddridge, for I believe she
really hates the dog, as ner rival in my Aunt's affections, and I dare
say is now secretly hoping that she is witnessing the last of
Charlie—" How could you be so cruel!"
Cousin John coming in by the window— {Note on Cousin John—
if there is any mode of entrance except the door, I observe he will
always enter by it—here he's got a choice of three windows, and
my Aunt is never startled by his unexpected appearance, as she
would be by mine)—has a remedy for Charlie at once. He'11 "set
him all right," he says, "in two twos. Come up, you little war-
mint!" With which he takes up the little " warmint" by the scruff

of his neck (which must be most unpleasant, yet neither of the " Old
Gals" remonstrate), and carries him out on to the lawn.
I take this opportunity to observe that I am sorry to say my train
goes in an hours time, and that I've sent for a fly.
"01" says my Aunt, quite cheerfully, smiling (a week ago she
would have cried), "we're going out for a drive with John in a
quarter of an hour, so perhaps we shan't be here when you start."
This grates upon me: yes, although I don't want a scene (because
it would be so trying for my nerves, and make me so feverish for
travelling), yet this does grate on me.
I tell her I am going yachting with Wethebby. The word
"yachting," besides having an aristocratic smack about it, must
bring to the mind of any old lady who lives " at home at ease" (as
the song says) the fact that she is accustomed to trouble herself very
little about the dangers incurred by those who venture upon the seas,
"when the stormy winds do blow. [It occurs to my mind, for one
second, to wonder whether Wetherby goes to sea in such a state of
things, or not. Not, I should say.]
My Aunt is impassive. She is not a good sailor herself, but hopes
that I am. Have I ever been to sea before P No, I've not. Oh! End
of that topic. Charlie brought in quite lively and frisky, but very
damp. The means resorted to appear to have been very simple.
John, by his own account, "held the little beggar by the tail and
dipped him in the sea." Result satisfactory, with a craving for
more biscuits apparently. Doddbidge embraces him, "0, de poo
little Charlywarley, then! did they (meaning me—so kind of her,
just as I'm going away) give it nasty almond-biscuits and cream, a
little mannikin, then!" Doddridge is ordered off to dry him. I
look at my watch—so does John.
"I say, Old Gal," this to my Aunt from John, "it's time for you
to get on your go-to-meeting bonnet, as the one-horse shay will be
round here before you've cleaned yourself," and he finishes off with
a wink at me, as if I had suggested this style of address, and was
quietly entering into the spirit of the thing.
My Aunt,who has sat herself down at her writing-table, only
remarks, "How absurd you are, John," and then asks him " Who's
coming here to-morrow r"
"O, he replies, "there are the Tinton girls and Wayde."
"Will they come to the pie-nic on Thursday?" asks my Aunt.
(My Aunt going to a pic-mc !!) John isn't quite certain, but he
hopes so, and he adds, "I've got Judkin to bring his drag for
Saturday, when we can all drive over in it to Canterbury; only he
wants to know, if he comes back with us, can you bed him?"
My Aunt pauses for an instant, then quietly answers. Of course
we can, as George will be away then, and he can have his room."
Now, I should like—for this has roused me—I should like to dash
my hat down, jump up, hit the table with my clenched fist, and
exclaim, "No, confound it, I'm not going." But I don't, I merely
smile, and reply upon the observation with assumed indifference,
"Yes, I shall be away then," for I'm not going to flatter my Aunt
and John, who is almost a bully in his manner, by showing any sort
of desire to stay.
Why should they have put off all their amusements until my
departure? True that I have said to my Aunt how much I love
quiet, how I prefer Ramsgate, at her un-seasonable time, to Rams-
gate in full bloom; but, hang it, I do like to be asked. There's
something so melancholy, too, in hearing arrangements made in
one's presence for gaieties to come off when (it's a sad phrase)
one will be no longer here to witness them. It makes one feel
as if the future were a blank. It seems to me (for having nothing
to do with them while they are still continuing their conversa-
tion on the same subject, I can only sit and think), suddenly, a
melancholy notion that Ramsgate will wake up to-morrow morning
and I shan't be there. That my Aunt and JonN and their party
will be gay, and not so much as a reference made to myself. Will
any of them say, will either of these two here say, at the height
of their revelry (fancy my Aunt's and Doddridge's revelry, bah !),
"I wish George were here?" No, they won't, I feel they won't,
and that's what touches me, and almost brings tears into my eyes.
At this instant the grenadier in petticoats announces " The car-
riage. Mum!" and Doddridge appears with my Aunt's bonnet and
shawl, which she puts on before the glass, while my Cousin John
bustles into the hall, and I hear him ordering the grenadier to take
heaps of rugs and wraps to the trap.
Another Note.—I thought a sailor was always a rough, hardy sort
of chap, ready for all weathers, and rather preferring bad to good.
But Cousin John From Sea (if he's a specimen, and not an excep-
tion) seldom goes out without a greatcoat, never walks a step farther
than he can help, always carries an umbrella, never appears without
the latest invented scent on his pockethandkerchief, and the best-
fitting gloves; and if there 'b the slightest sign of rain, or if it's
blowing ever so little, catch him going out! Not a bit of it. He
has wraps on his bed, a wadded dressing-gown, a fire in his bed-
room nearly all day, and seldom gets up till past ten, my Aunt
allowing him to breakfast at whatever time he chooses. If our Navy
is composed of Cousin Johns, then I don't believe in our Navy. He
hasn't got a single sea-phrase—not a word about marlingspikes,
bunting, gaffs, belay, and so forth. While I'm away out yachting,
I shall be able to compare him, in my mind's eye, with real sailors,
and shall write to my Aunt about him, and expose him as a naval
impostor.
While I am thinking this out, my Aunt is getting herself ready.
She is ready. Quite. So " Good-bye!" to me, from her. Nothing
more. Not a purse of gold—the tip that I used to receive from her
on my going to school multiplied now by as many times as I have
increased in years. No—no memento. No hope expressed of ever
seeing me again. I venture to throw this in, on my own account,
in an off-hand manner, thus: "I '11 try and run down during the
season." My Aunt to this only replies, "You will no doubt find us
here."
Cousin John puts her into the wagonette, and muffles her up with
tiger skms, rough rugs, and a big cloak. To all intents and pur-
poses, as far as I am concerned, he has buried my Aunt away out of
my sight. That's what I've got to thank him for at present. An
impostor sailor! He is going to drive! A sailor going to drive 1
My Aunt, who clutches at my arm spasmodically, and squeaks and
screams, in a fly with me, sees him take the reins unmoved. "Good-
bye, Geobge. old boy," says he to me from the box; "keep your-
self dry, and don't get very sick when you're out on the ocean
wave." I dp believe my Aunt, under her covers, is laughing at this
brutality: and as to Doddridge upon my word and honour, I'm
not a vindictive man, but if I could just put Doddridge into a pan-
tomime scene with the Clown and Pantaloon to make love to her
after their peculiar fashion, ending with knocking her into a flour-
tub, or waking her up with a hot poker, I should—I really should—
like tp see it done, and assist in doing it myself.
So they drive away.
I turn back to the hall. "Coo-coo-grrr; coo-coo-grrr!" says the
Gentle Dove, bowing at me ten times to half a minute. I wish my
fly would come. I feel moped, wretched, hipped. Why? Such
small things oughtn't to affect a good constitution. No. Then
is it the fact that I've got a bad constitution? Is it the ....
From a dreamy state I am aroused. The fly!
Once more over the uneven roads, once more down Ramsgate's
narrow streets (built for sociability's sake, probably, and with the
smallest possible amount of pavement, suggesting tight-rope practice
for beginners) towards the Station on the sands. Of course, a waggon,
large enough to make ten of my fly (fly-horse included), meets us at
the narrowest part; of course my flyman wanted to pass it, and
failed; of course the waggon-driver is obstinate, and won't back;
of course my driver won't be outdone by the waggon-driver; of
course other carts are behind the waggon, and other flys and carts
behind us, and all trade in this, one of the main streets, is suddenly
paralysed. Of course all the drivers of all the carts and flys are
excessively polite and civil to one another. Foot-passengers retire
into shops on either side, and watch the proceedings, or, rather,
as we don't proceed at all, the dead-lock.
I explain that I must be at the Station at nuch and such a time
exactly; that it only wants two minutes; that it's most important
1 should catch the train; that I won't pay him if he doesn't;
that .... Shouts from behind . . . . Waggoner gives way to the
extent of about a quarter of an inch, by nearly emptying his load
into a fishmonger's window. The quarter of an inch does it; re-
leased, we rush by him—Mazeppa, in a fly, tied to time, catching
the train—imperfect simile, but thought of, hurriedly, in connection
with "Again he urges on his wild, &c. We round the market-
place—the flyman defying the laws of centrifugal force by trying to
keep himself straight on the box—down High Street, in sight of the

HAPPY TIMES IN PKOSPECT.
Young Johnstone, that Boanerges of Bunkum, whose eloquence
ever and anon makes Sussex Hall shake from attic to area, and
Clerkenwell Pump palpitate to the lowest inch of its piston-rod, has
lately given us a sketch of what we are to expect when the Inter-
national has swamped the National all over the world, and Kings
suppressed, Priests squenched, and Capital made away with—the
Commune rules the roast, while rotten old Society, like Jison cut
up and sent to pot by his daughter Medea, is hashed and broiled,
stewed and boiled, young and strong again, not without some expen-
diture of fire, and some bubbling and seething of the European
kettle. Johnstone's sketch only extends to London, it is true, but
the war of the Commune with Capital extends to all capitals, and
we may judge by the fate from which Paris was scarce saved, that
Johnstone's burning eloquence has not overdrawn or over-coloured
the picture of the London of the future in the Millennial times of
the Social and Democratic Republic—not one and indivisible as it
used to be a hundred years ago, but a million and infinitely divi-
sible, as Communal arrangements proposes to make it now-a-days.
Here is Johnstone's programme of his Troynovant—his Londinia
Renovata—or rather, his New Jerusalem, to be_ founded where
London was. Imprimis, the public monuments—in particular the
statues and columns of the West End, are to be overthrown. Well,
by help of philosophy, we think we could get over that. Indeed, we
are not sure that, if ever Johnstone stands at the bar'—in other
words, if ever folly becomes criminal by attempting to reduce its
wild talk into wicked act—he will not be able powerfully to plead in
mitigation of punishment, that he did his best to have the Duke of
Yohk's column and Nelson's pillar pulled down, and Napier and
Havelock coined into coppers.
Then, the clubs are to be turned into hospitals, and the churches
into social and democratic clubs, on the prinoiple, we presume, of
turn and turn about, and to keep np a kind of parallelism between
change of functions in our buildings, and changes of status and style
among our rulers, when Johnstone shall sit as Disraeli, Odoee
beam on us from the place of Gladstone, and Lucraft rule the
Committee of Council instead of Forster.
Happy times! with Labour planting its foot on the neck of Capital,
and emancipated Industry taking Wealth by the throat, and Society
blessing its new benefactors, and nobody working, and everybody
playing, and the larks falling ready roasted into our months, and
the rivers running with bottled porter and draught stout, and
tobacco-pipes, ready charged, springing spontaneously by the way-
side, and Jack being as good as his master—rather a tarnation sight
better, and the great new Zeus, Happy-go-Lucky, being installed
as ruler of the Universe, with the Cnief s of tho Commune for his
vicegerents, Saturn runs baok and brings the Age of Gold! 0,
happy times, oome quickly I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
THE CROPS.
eicesteb Squaee this year promises
to yield but a very
small crop—in fact,
so small, that it is
expected it will
scarcely be worth col-
lecting. It has been
offered to several en-
terprising farmers,
but they nave all in-
dignantly declined
the offer, declaring
that it would not
|4jjyj|jj(-f even pa„ for (ho cut-
ting. Whether this
pitiable deficiency is
owing to the absence
of sun, or the long
prevalence of the
easterly winds, or
the unusual pre-
ponderance of brick-
bats, which have
fallen this season in
swarms more than
sufficient at once to
create a blight on the
most luxuriant soil,
or whether it is to
be attributable to the
withdrawal of the
dancing-licence from
the Alhambra, it is
impossible to tell;
but the calamity is
to be a thousand times regretted, inasmuch as the close proximity
of the Square to the neighbouring Haymarket would have rendered
the sale of the produce of the very easiest description, and the
result, if at all favourable, might have been a golden harvest,
such as this highly-devastated district has not known for years. As
it is, "the Headless Horseman" (the original of Captain Mayne
Reed's thrilling romance), who represents fallen Royalty in the
centre of the enclosure, looks knocked all of a heap in consequence.

CONUNDRUM.
Dear Punch,
Mv first is called Jack, my second is what
The Conqueror was, and what I am not.
My whole is a creature that walks about
On a couple of legs. Can you find it out?
Would you be surprised, Mr. Punch, to hear that the answer to
this is Dor-king t My first, Jack-Date. My second, William, the
first King of England. My third, a Dorking. If you are surprised,
say so, and make no stranger of
Yours, conundrumically,
Count Farrago the First.
A CAUTION TO THIEVES.
The converse of the adage Ne tutor ultra crepidam is observed at
the Home Office. As a contemporary justly remarks:—
"The police are indefatigable) in their care ot the street side of the base-
ment of inhabited houses—more indefatigable, perhaps, than is necessary,
considering that tho tramp of the constabte, whom officialism refuses to shoe
in noiseless india-rubber, is generally heard about a quarter of a mile off."
If Mr. Odger had got into Parliament, if he had succeeded there
insomuch as to have obtained a place in the Ministry, and if that
place were the office of Home Secretary, it would, in one particular,
be very much more ably filled than it is now. Shoes are beyond
Mr. Bruce, but Mr. Odger could take care that the Police were
shod properly, with a view to their increased efficiency. At any
rate he would be able to make arrangements for that purpose, and
we trust that he would make them, notwithstanding his connection
with the " International" Association.
As it is, one would think, not knowing better, that the Police were
supplied with boots by parties in the pay of tae predatory classes,
ana that those boots, which cause Policemen to tramp so heavily as
to give timely warning of their approach to thieves, were made ex-
pressly with intent to that end. It would seem as if the Police,
since they cannot be brought to go about springing their rattles, had
been surreptitiously shod with boots designed to answer the same
purpose as the rattle-snake's tail.
INSPIRITING CHANT
(For June, 1871).
Come 1 pile up the logs 1
Pile 'em up on the do^s I
And, warmed by spiced wine, sing a tune!
Fill, fill up my rummer,
Boys, here's to the Summer—
The shivering weather of June!
To-morrow the hounds
Shall meet on my grounds
Unless a hard frost comes too soon;
If so, through my gates
To the lake with our skates.
Hurrah! for the gay sports of June!
ON THEIR WORST BEHAVIOUR.
"The Public Orator then delivered the Crcwcian Oration,
dumb Bhow, the uproar in the Undergraduates' Gallery dro^
from beginning to end with senseless and inarticulate roars."
It is necessary to state, for the information of those who are not
acquainted with the peculiar customs of our seats of learning, that
this is an extract from an account of the unmannerly proceedings
at the Oxford Commemoration held in the year 1871. The fittest
comment that can be made upon it is, that the proper functionary
to deliver an oration (short and sharp and stern) to a crew so
outrageous and silly won1'1 1,0 ° ™»u™»n«>«
. policeman.
MAKING PROGRESS.
"We understand that the Treasury and Mr. Street, the architect, are at
present engaged in correspondence as to the elevation of the Law Courts."
This raises our hopes. We trust the result of the correspondence
about their elevation will he the speedy raising of the Courts. The
year 1900 will now, probably, see the completion of these buildings,
and also of the new National Gallery and Natural History Museum.
The Wellington Monument might be thrown open for public inspec-
tion at the same time. (N.B. This will be the last appearance of the
Lord Mayor and Corporation of London in an official capacity.)
DISORGANISATION OF THE ARMY.
How could we ever, if at war, carry the war into the enemy's
country if the law were what Mr. W. M. Torrens proposes it should
be; namely that " no person enlisted as a soldier in any regiment of
cavalry or of the line shaU be called upon to serve Her Majesty
out of the United Kingdom until he shall have attained the age of
twenty years?" We should then have no cavalry for foreign ser-
vice except men who had all reached their majority, and, in so far
as we should not have any minors in our foot regiments, no infantry
at all.
Going1, Going 1
A debate in the House of Commons on the New Forest has in-
formed us of " the sale of incomparable old trees for firewood"—
"an ancient yew-woo4 contemporaneous with the Conqueror,"
having fetched as much as £60! We would suggest to those who
have the mismanagement of this sort of thing that a great deal of
money, much more than sixty pounds, might be made by selling the
old castles and other picturesque hut unproductive ruins, the p
perty of the Crown, for building or paving materials.

Cadmus and Cardwell.
Gardwell and Cadmus are names that may be associated other-
wise than by alliteration. Cadmus sjew a Dragon; Cardwell has

Lea Absinthes Ont Toujours Tort.
ABSrNTiiE is, by some people, regarded as a chief one
among the many causes of the decadence of France. Men
holding this opinion might, if they would make a point
of it, observe that, inasmuch as Ireland has been very
nearly ruined by her Absentees, so France has been en-
dangered, also, by her Absinthe-tees.
PHILISTINES AND THEIR FOES.
A German, enjoying the protection of this country, abuses it,
after the customary fashion of foreigners, in the Allgemeine Zeitung,
He proposes that the Emperor of German r should undertake our
regeneration in the capacity of another William the Conqueror.
We all know that the sort of Germans of whom this writer is a
specimen, call us names, and that one of these names, implying
stolid narrow-mindedness, is also the name of an ancient people
of Syria. He may accordingly consider that Kaiser Wilhelm,
would, in invading us, smite the Philistines. Accepting for John
Bull the name of Philistine, we would not say that our guest and
enemy is another. Doubtless he is not. On the contrary, per-
adventure, he is one of those gentlemen whose forefathers were the
Philistines' peculiar enemies.
HIGH PRACTICAL JOKE.
A brilliant idea, as at first proposed, has since been improved in
brilliancy, according to the statement thus noticed by the Timet i
"Westminster Clock Towee Liokt.—It is stated that the light to be
exhibited on the great clock tower at Westminster during the sitting of Par-
liament will not be a lime light, but the magneto-electric light, which is
much more brilliant."
The more striking will be the contrast between the light placed
above St. Stephen's, and the speeches which continue, whilst it
shines there, to be made inside.
Height of Aggravation.
Wet mornings-bad street band in full blare before the house of
literary man, writing an article, and suffering from toothache—
loud ring at the bell—servant called off from a pressing domestic
duty, making the beds, or minding the baby, or something of the
sort—proceeds the whole length of the front garden to find at the
gate one of the instrumentalists, who invites payment for the
torture inflicted by himself and his fellow fiends.
FRENCH AND ENGLISH FINANCE.
When shall we hear a Chancellor of the Exchequer make
such a financial statement as that made the other day at Versailles
by M. Thiers P "Never, let us hope," will be the answer of those
who only consider that M. Thiers had to provide for a deficit of
£65,000,000. But if they belong to the privileged classes who pay
taxes for the rest of the community, let them ponder the telegram
which states that—
"In reply to M. Germain, the Chief of the Executive declared that he
would never associate his name with the establishment of an Income-tax in
France."
Fanoy what Bort of a Budget we should be presented with if
England were in the plight of France, and Mr. Lowe in the place
of M. Thiers. The tax with which M. Thiers will not associate
his name would be that which Mr. Lowe would not scruple to
impose on a part of the people. M. Thiers will make no concession
to Communism. Taxes are not pleasant things, but they manage
these things better in France, even under difficulties compared to
which our own circumstances are easy. They manage them without
confiscation.
Sad Change.
One of the most amiable and gentle of men, who had hitherto
borne the character of being the best of husbands, actually boasted
the other evening to a friend who dropped in unexpectedly, that he
had that moment beaten hit wife hollow. The unhappy lady was
found close to a chess-table.
Misplaced Confidence.
Great confusion seems to have been created by the misplacing of
a foot-note in the seoond Vol. of Lord Brougham's Autobiography.
From this, we infer, that it isn't every foot-note that is to be con-
strued literally au pied de la lettre.
