II and bearing the wassail bowl. Show him in. Show him in.”
“ Crowned with fiddlesticks, and bearing your grandmother," replied an exceedingly well-attired elderly gentleman,
unfastening an Ulster coat, and protruding a Gibus hat. “Good morning, MR. PUNCH. The weather is not pleasant.
Do not let your dog jump upon me, as his legs look muddy."
"The cold which should belong to the season seems to have settled in your heart," muttered MR. Punca, offended
at this iciness on the part of his old friend.
“Epigrammatically sentimental," said MR. CHRISTMAS, taking off his great-coat, and lighting a cigarette. “Any.
thing going on?"
“There's a question from Him! At Yuletide! At his own season! Has anything happened to you, my dear
old boy ? Let us heap on more wood, and while the roaring log emits its festive fireworks, let us drain a foaming goblet
in your honour."
“Let us heap on nothing of the kind,” said the old gentleman, blandly. “The room is too hot already ; but until
we get rid of hearths and stoves, and have air-pipes, rooms will never be properly warmed. As for the goblet, I never take
anything but water before dinner, unless perhaps a glass of the driest sherry.".
" And this is CÆRISTMAS !” shouted Mr. Punch, aghast. “This mild Epicurean is the type of roystering mirth,
the incarnation of revelry.”
“It appears to me, my dear MR. PUNCH," said MR. CARISTMAS, “ that you are a very worthy person, but rather
addicted to conventional ideas. Suppose you get out of that old groove, and cease to talk nonsense. Why am I to be for

and excess ?"
"O, this is too much," said Mr. Punch, rather in sorrow than in anger. “Has CHRISTMAS taken the Pledge ?"
“No, my dear, but excita' ile friend. I am for no extremes. But why persons should eat and drink more than

lend yourself to such doctrine."

Toby, that I may wake. Am I in Wonderland, with darling ALICE, or ám I Through the Looking-Glass, going to kill

“Neither, my Beamish Boy. But you are hearing good sense. And," said the old gentleman, “will you be
good enough to take down that abominable caricature of me, I mean that Guy with the stick and lantern ? If there

“Of course, MR. PUNCH, I can say no more. A gentleman cannot dictate to his company, but he can choose it.
I have protested against your old-fashioned notions of cheerfulness; I have now the honour to leave you to your own

MR. PUNCH has never been able to explain to himself, quite satisfactorily, by what process he passed from the
delivery of his essay on friendship to the following situation. But somehow he shook off a dreadful nightmare, and

that as we are somewhat tardy in our commemoration, by monument
and statue, of the deserving dead, we of this generation may
escape seeing all of these eighteen pieces of the sculpture of the
future unveiled and inaugurated; the other, that the eagerness now
shown by so many respectable people to have M.P. tacked to their

By hounding it to deadly war with capital-

That all Faith's folly, Kings' rule diabolical-

A LETTER of an instructive Contemporary's Roman Correspondent
concludes with the following narrative :-
"I have mentioned in some preceding letters the pretended miracle of the
winking Madonna on the Piazza di San Crisogono. Recently, walking from
St. Peter's out of the Porta Cavallegeri, I was surprised to see a crowd col-
lected before the shrine of a Madonna adjoining the gate. A new miracle had
been just witnessed, and several foreign priests, with their opera-glasses fixed
on the image, were eagerly waiting for a renewal of the prodigy."
Should you be surprised to hear that they saw.what they looked
for ? Not at all, considering that a mooncalf, under the influence

address in defence of the

that "he felt so disgusted
with some of its sentiments,
that he attended the next
meeting, denounced the
authors, and withdrew alto-
gether from the Council.”
Mr. Punch has much satis-
faction in giving publicity
to this information. He
hopes that MR. LUCRAFT'S
manly repudiation of the
abominable sentiments of
that address will be largely
imitated by the British ar-
tisan, who has been grossly
insulted by the promulga-
tion, on the part of his so-
called representatives, of a
document which is a disgrace
even to them. Their single
excuse is, that they do not
understand the meaning of
words, and they had better
adopt this excuse than be
supposed to approve of the
cold-blooded assassination
of helpless prisoners.

COMMUNISM AGAINST CAPITAL.
On the relations between Capital and Labour, it may be observed,
for the information of skilled workmen, that there is Capital of
another kind than money. Capital is derived from caput, head; and
the Capital most worthy of its name is that contained by the skull;
to wit, brains. It is against this Capital, no less than the other,
that the International Communists conspire in trying to enforce
their system of artificial equality, which would level ability to
incompetence.
It is a mistake to suppose that the International Communists are
Working-Men. They are, on the contrary, Idling-Men, or men who
would fain be idle at the expense of others' labour. When idle men
combine, industrious men should unite.

IL RÉ GALANTUOMO AT ROME!
(July, 1871.)
VICTOR EMMANUEL at Rome! O names
Of mockery to Papalini ears!
VICTOR! the conqueror, whose conquest shames
_ The Church's crowned sons, and their faithless fears :
EMMANUEL! whose presence 'fileth Rome
As the fiend's hoof-print would the Vatican,
Or as the Serpent's trail fouled Adam's home,
When, with the bait of Knowledge to tempt Man,
He came, as this accursèd King has come,
In spite of bell, and book, and Papal ban!
No miracle is wrought his step to stay,
No thunderbolt is launched to blast his crown;
And Rome makes haste her ancient neck to lay
Under his cloven hoof, submissive, down!
Meanwhile, a prisoner in his Holy Hall,
Il Papa Ré sits sad, but unsubdued,"
And waits and watches, till the lightning fall.
Is he infallible, and shall the brood
Of Hell dare oust him from St. Peter's stall,
Foul the bénitier, trample on the rood ?
Did Paul and Peter swoop in wrath from Heaven,
To stay the march of ATTILA and his Huns,
And has Heaven's armoury no store of levin
To smite and scathe Rome's renegado sons ?
Can Peter's bark be destined to decay,
In piecemeal rot, like a rat-eaten hulk:
Not pass in elemental war away,
Buried in Earth's convulsed and crashing bulk ?
Shall the worst King find friends—Il Papa Ré
Alone be left, uncomforted, to sulk ?
Uncomforted, but by those fair fine words,
That butter not the parsnip's lenten fare,
And the stray Peter's pence, which from their hoards
The faithful seem to find so hard to spare.
And worse than all, unpersecuted quite;
Shows of respect kept up; King's state maintained;
Cardinals, Monsignori, Monks, black, white,
And brown, and whitey-brown, left unrestrained
To come, and go, and keep Church-weapons bright
With odium theologicum ingrained.
And Rome? Doth she not weep and tear her hair,
Or take up arms to strike with might and main,
For Papa Ré, St. Peter's lineal heir,
Beyond St. Peter's years the first to reign?
Accursed Rome! She pranks herself in smiles,
Hangs out her lights and flowers, from street to street,
In welcome of this King, by Satan's wiles
Led on to set him high in Cæsar's seat,
For all the Infallible upon him piles
Curses, to knock an Atlas off his feet.
And Italy to Rome holds eager hands,
And Rome clasps longing hands with Italy;
And their great shout goes thrilling through all lands,
“ Italia una! Free from sea to sea !”
And Papa Ré bethinks him of a time
When that same song for burden bore his name,
While blessings rang around it, like a chime
Of marriage-bells; and now in wrath and shame
He stops his ears, but still, from none to prime,
Thro' barred doors, blocked ears, sounds the glad acclaim !

BROWN AND FAIR.
The British Medical Journal makes the gratifying
announcement that the Brown Institute, in the Uni-
versity of London, for the Treatment and Study of the
Diseases of Domestic Animals, is now an accomplished
fact, and that Dr. BURTON SANDERSON, F.R.S., has been
appointed by the Senate the first Brown Professor. DR.
BURTON is probably the only Brown Professor in the
United Kingdom. But in the United States, whose
population includes a considerable number of coloured
gentlemen, and whose free institutions permit all Ameri-
can citizens to fill all employments of which they are
capable, irrespectively of colour, there are doubtless
many Brown Professors.
To the foregoing remark it may be added that, when
the rights of women shall have been recognised in this
country to the full extent demanded by the principles of
political and social equality, we shall see our Univer-
sities adorned with Professors of the fair sex, and among
these, since not a few of the fair sex have dark com-
plexions, there will be Brunettes.

“THE CAUSE FOR WHICH HAMPDEN,” &c.
At least you may illustrate one of Heaven's laws,
“ Fools must pay for their folly," and so verbum sat. .
Henceforth, English history may add to “the cause
For which HAMPDEN bled” that, like him, Earth is flat.
HAMPDEN believed that the Earth it was flat;
HAMPDEN he backed his opinion with money ;
“Five hundred to one" 'twas as flat as his hat;
And an umpire he named-this philosopher funny.
As the Globe's champion, the lists WALLACE entered.
By award of the umpire, proof positive found
That the vulgar belief in sound science was centered :
That HAMPDEN was flat, the Earth proveably round.
HAMPDEN submitted; forked out his five hundred ;
But thereafter 'gainst WALLACE waxed wrathful indeed;
Who shall say, if because he had lost, or had blundered,
If for loss of his cash, or upset of his creed ?
But whatever the cause, HAMPDEN took in retort to
Such language of WALLACE, and eke of his wife;
That WALLACE, though wight, Stratford Bench must resort to,
To swear HAMPDEN put him in fear of his life.
Then the Themis of Stratford she lightened and thundered,
Bade HAMPDEN find sureties for keeping the peace,
Two in thirty pounds each, and himself in a hundred ;
And in default gave him in charge to the p'lice.
Learn, HAMPDEN, if parties will back their belief
In cash, by the consequence parties must bide :
You believed, staked your tin, named your judge, came to grief-
Bite the fox ne'er so hard, still the pain you must hide.
While you argue in words, your wrath's vials you 're free
On their heads, who oppose you, to empty at will:
But when to your faiths you have pledged £ s. d.,
And lost, you must pocket the loss and sit still.
THIRTY YEARS AGO !
On Monday last there was the most extraordinary excitement
everywhere.
The Tower and Park cannons fired all day.
About a dozen Balloons went up.
The Volunteers saluted whenever they were not shooting at the
targets.
All the Church bells rang without intermission.
It was a holiday at all Public Offices, Banks, and Law Courts.
Parliament refused to sit.
The Carnivora at the Zoological roared like mad things.
The Railway Engineers shrieked more furiously and continuously
| than ever, if possible.
The Street Fountains played Claret at fourpence per bottle.
Everybody made presents to everybody.
The Lamplighters turned on the gas to its utmost flare.
The Public generally shouted itself hoarse.
“What the Deuce does it all mean?" said Mr. Punch, for the
first and only time in his life puzzled.
“Does not your honour know?” said Toby.
“Not I, my Faithful,” said his Master.
“Well, I never !” said Toby, smiling. "Why, isn't it the
glorious Seventeenth of July ?”
“Where's the glory of that day, you Stupid ?" replied Mr. Punch.
“Why, Lord and Master,” said the astounded Dog, opening great
eyes, “wasn't you born on the 17th July, 1841 ?”

All so lightly reckoned,

BETS AND BUDGET.
IF MR. ROBERT LOWE were not wedded to the idea of raising revenue by
simply amercing the Income-tax payer, he might, as Finance Minister, turn
an honest penny by getting a clause added to the Government Betting Bill by
imposing a tax on bets, to be paid by the winner. He would thus derive
lucellum from a source which would yield it without the hardship of its ex-
traction out of lux. But probably, as the very principle on which he professes
to arrange taxation is that of making it disagreeable, MR. LOWE's objection
to a Bet-tax would be the peculiarity that it would put nobody's pipe out.

THE HEALTHY MILLER.
THERE was a Jolly Miller,
So cheerful, gay, and free,
He lived in his mill,
And he never was ill,
Such a healthy Miller was he.
He had such an appetite he had,
He could eat enough for three;
He would stuff and swill,
And never be ill,
Such a healthy Miller was he.
Chorus-He had, &c.
He ate toadstools and fungi,
Under the greenwood tree,
Then he danced a quadrille,
For he didn't feel ill,
But as brisk as a Bumble Bee.
He took ten steaks for breakfast,
He drank ten pints of tea;
But the tea and the grill,
Never made him ill,
Such a healthy Miller was he!
Chorus (as before).
He dined off a bullock roasted whole,
With most it could not agree;
But he went out to drill,
For he didn't feel ill,
He belonged to the Yeo-man-ree.
He ate roast goose and custard,
And then went out to sea;
The boat wasn't still,
But he didn't feel ill,
Such a healthy Miller was he.
Chorus (as before).
He'd porridge and potatoes,
Each night at a hostelrie,
When he'd paid the bill,

He called for kidgeree.

WE read in a weekly paper :-.,
“6 MR. * * * * * * took his benefit last Monday and Tuesday at the
Theatre. SIR ROGER TICHBORNE was present on Tuesday, and upon leaving
the theatre he was loudly cheered.”
Mr. Punch would inquire whether this sort of thing is to go on
until the 7th of November. It was freely resorted to a good while
back, and paragraphs in favour of the person who asserts himself to
be, and perhaps is, SIR ROGER TICHBORNE, were foisted into all
corners. But now that the case is half heard, this kind of touting
is worse than objectionable. Punch omits the name of a clever
actor and a respectable theatre from the above paragraph, as there
is no reason for connecting either with the name of the Claimant.
What kind of animals “cheered ” a person who, upon oath, has
described himself to be utterly despicable, we do not care to ask ;
but we trust that they were the gentlemen of the pavement, not a
theatrical audience.
A SONG FOR SUMMER TIME.
(By One who scarce can claim to be esteemed a Sentimentalist.)
O, THERE's nothing half so sweet in life,
As strawberries and cream!
I dote on them, as doth my wife,
And, both, of them we dream.
MYNHEER VON DUNK, who ne'er was drunk,
They bring into my thoughts :
For of cream a pint a day's my stint,
Of strawberries two quarts.
The apricot let others praise,
Or pear, or peach, or pine,
In me these fruits no longing raise,
Be they however fine.
Some tastes the nectarine more suits,
Or gage yclepéd green ;
To me the queen of British fruits,
Is Myatt's “British Queen.”
The melon is to some a treat,
I eat it with affright;
These luscious fruits, altho' so sweet,
Oft cause a sleepless night.
But no such fear awaits the man,
Whom strawberries content;
Let him demolish all he can,
The feast he'll ne'er repent.
Then gather strawberries while ye may,
Too soon their time is o'er ;
And, milkman, bring me every day
Of cream a pint, or more.
And when the fleeting joys of earth,
O poet! is your theme,
Fail not to call a stanza forth,
On strawberries and cream!
OUR NATIONAL INSURANCE.
JOHN BULL, at seasons, in a panic fright,
Cries out for troops fit all the world to fight.
The House of Jaw resounds with long debates,
And votes a huge increase of Estimates.

Remains inadequate as 'twas before.
No stronger force has John his Fleet behind,
But pays his money, and has eased his mind.

WET AND DRY SUNDAYS,
HE Gentlemen of the Plat-
form who advocate a dry
Sunday are respectfully in-
vited to consider the sub-
joined resolution, passed
at a public meeting lately
held in St. George's Hall,
Langham Place, Regent
Street, for an object ap-
proved of by Sir John
BOWRING, and other stre-
nuous yindicators, as far
as men may be, of liberty :
“ That this meeting has
seen with regret a professedly
Liberal Government seeking
to retain and impose coercive
measures for Sunday obsery-
ance, and is of opinion that
the opening of national mu-
seums and galleries on Sun-
days would do more to promote
temperance and prevent un-
necessary Sunday trading than
the enforcement of old and
obsolete Acts of Parliament,
obnoxious to the feelings and
subversive of the rights of the

Would be better for facing, at present.
There are " 'spounders and 'splajners” about
Who feel rank's distinctions a scandal ;
For dislike, disaffection, and doubt,
Make all that's established a handle.
people."
Who kings, nobles, priests, from the stage
Would thrust, to take rank as their betters;
And print future history's page
In a type without Capital letters.
Who to hands would dispatch heads to school,
Hold landlords, at best, as but lodgers;
And insist that millennial rule
Will be that of the BRADLAUGHS and ODGERS ;
That by cutting in federal slips .
You'll renew nations' youth, à la Æson ;
And from all known faiths shattered to chips,
Build up a new Temple of Reason:
Who 'twixt masters and men sow ill-will,
Or where good-will unites them would snap it all,
And the yeins of their Commune-wealth fill
By drying the fountains of Capital.
Perhaps the Gentlemen of the Sabbatarian and Liquor Law Plat-
forms have their doubts as to the correctness of that opinion. Then
let them, some fine Sunday, as many of them as possible, make a
Pilgrimage (not to say excursion) to Kew Gardens, and on the next
fine Sunday another Pilgrimage to Hampton Court. Such a Sabbath
Day's journey, to speak as those who call Sunday the Sabbath, will
be legitimate labour on the Day of Rest; rightly regarded it will be
a labour of love. Of that labour, indeed, viewed in that light, they
will make a pleasure, even though they should abstain from indul-
gence in so much as ginger-beer. At either of those two places of
public resort they will witness a truly gratifying spectacle, a mul-
titude combining the most exemplary sobriety with unrestricted
access to beer and other invigorating liquors. Now, at Hampton
Court there is a picture gallery, and at Kew there are two museums;
solvitur ambulando, therefore, the question for them as to the effect
of opening museums and picture galleries on Sundays, as they may
convince themselves on any convenient Sunday by a stroll through
those scenes of moral and intellectual recreation. They will behold
the popular influence of a Sunday which, being dry neither to mind
nor body, is not wet in the sense wherein an inconsistent member of
the Society of Friends is called a Wet Quaker. Suppose they
compare the phenomena presented by Kew Gardens and Hampton
Court on a Sunday in point of temperance with those which
might be discovered in certain Scottish interiors whence there are no
neighbouring picture galleries or museums to attract the people.
Then perhaps they will see the policy, even on their own principles,
with a view to practical good, of unbarring the doors of those insti-
tutions on the weekly holiday of the working classes.

he would, and an unscientific anonymous bard has even
imagined that he could. Cookery is applied chemistry,

Tuesday. A morning sitting, all devoted to Ballot. At night,
SIR CHARLES ADDERLEY introduced a really valuable Bill to con-
solidate and amend the laws relating to public health. But, of
course, this is to stand over until next year, when we shall perhaps
have some additional information before us, obtained from a Witness
that is said to have appeared in the East, and may be en route for
England. Should he come, with the usual consequences, or worse,
it will be of course a sufficient administrative answer to the question
why we were not better prepared for his visit, that we were much
too busy contriving a scheme for purifying Election Returns to be
able to purify our Waters.
MR. JESSEL made an able speech against Mr. ROUNDELL PALMER'S
scheme for a College of Law. He took large ground, and contended
that our law system, which is dear to the people, was of a nature
not to be learned in a doctrinal way. There is something pleasant
in a sound and healthy speech in these days of line and rule, and
"education to order." But that law and lawyers require a precious

Wherein fust rose the Black Hog's race.

And whomsomedever disagreed

Once, when the Black Hog's means was higher,
'A used to huck folks into fire,
But got his tuxes ground so low,

They wallers in their separate mires.
To differ'nt mires they so incline
That they to death be rival swine,

And sets their bristles up, and grunts.

NATIONAL AND DENOMI-NATIONAL.
HERE is come a deputation
About Irish education,
With the head of Dublin's great municipality,
To GLADSTONE, to enlist him
For what they call a system
Of “strict denominational equálity!”
If Catholic at Protestant
And vice versa, hot his taunt
Must fling, be that manhood's recreation :
Party tunes and mutual threshin'
Are for years of discretion,
Not luxuries for school-boy delectation.
When Ireland turns her wit to
Such wisdom, Punch says “ ditto :"
By all means keep teaching free of feuds sectarian :
Let all churches drink in knowledge,
From national school to college,
And in unity, at least, so far, be Unitarian.
How Punch had hugged the fancy,
But in Ireland facts who can see ?
That this was what wise MURRAY and wise WHATELEY,
With a tolerance rare as rational,
In the schools entitled “National,"
Through the Green Isle had set working mighty nately:
That their followers had bettered
The instruction they unfettered,
And in the noble army of Queen's Colleges,
Excluding only “Theo" -
(For which sense sings Laus Deo)
Had duly made provision for the “ologies."
So Ireland won the blessing, -
Still beyond JOHN BULL's possessing,-
Of a thorough unsectarian school gradation;
Where from learning's wells, at need,
Pat could drink, unchecked by creed-
Then what more has she to ask in Education ?
If the Priests denounce the school
Because in it they don't rule,
And the Colleges style "godless” and Socinian,
Because Church-Dogma there
Is not allowed a chair,
And scholar brooks not sectary's dominion-
Let us give things their right names,
And when Dublin's Lord Mayor claims
Fair play between the altar and the steeple,
Let us read between the lines,
“Hand our schools to our divines;
Leave our Priests free not to educate the people.”
So carry they the farce on-
Not more P.Þ. than Parson-
Each deprecates the other's itch for ruling,
But on this point they agree,
On this point would equal be,
That to Priest belongs supremacy in schooling.
Now we'd not see either Church
Leave the other in the lurch,
While neither on the tree of knowledge perches ;
But if either Church claim rule,
Of College or of school,
What we say is, "A plague on both your Churches."

RITUALIST PARSONATION WU9
On the occasion, one day last week, of laying the
foundation-stone of a new Church at Hampstead, the
EARL OF SHAFTESBURY delivered an address to the by-
standers, “in the course of which he expressed the
opinion that the Clergy must get rid of their buckram
and starch, and unite with other evangelical Christians
of other denominations if they wanted to preserve the
Church of England.” Yes, and get rid not only of their
buckram and starch, but also of their orfrey, and
embroidery, and lace, and all the rest of the sham
peacock's plumage in which the English Jack Daw
Parson attempts to personate the Romish Jack Priest.

LIBERATORS OF THE FAITH.
THE POPE has been pleased to reward MR. M'Evoy,
M.P., with the Order of St. Gregory for the service
done to Popery by the Member for Meath in procuring
the repeal of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act. There is,
however, somebody else whom the POPE has more to
thank for that matter than MR. M'Evoy. The repeal
of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act would have had to wait,
if Infallibility had remained united with Temporal
Power. It has been rendered possible by the establish-
ment of a constitutional Kingdom of Italy with Rome
for Capital. His Holiness has cause to confer the Order
of St. Gregory on no man so much as on the Sove-
reign of that Kingdom. But perhaps he deems that
recompense inadequate, peradventure the Holy Father will
present VICTOR EMMANUEL with the “Golden Rose."
From an Unpublished MS.
“It was the depth of winter, and a wild and stormy
night. The sky was inky black, not a star could be
seen, and the moon lay shrouded in masses of dense
cloud. The wind roared, the rain poured, the forest
groaned, the trees moaned, frost and snow were on the
ground, and desolation reigned around. He had long
found difficulties in his way, he had long been embar-
rassed, but at last he trembled, he hesitated, he stumbled,
he could go no farther-he had come to a dead pause." !!

"THE ELTHAM MURDER. A committee of gentlemen has, we under-
stand, been formed to collect subscriptions for the purpose of discharging the
pecuniary liabilities incurred in the defence of EDMUND WALTER Pook,
whom a jury of his country have declared innocent of the crime laid to his
charge, but whose family have been well-nigh ruined in the process, Sub-
scriptions will be received by MR. CHARLES HUDSON, Churchwarden of St.
Alphege, Greenwich, and MR. L. DE BREANSKI, Arthur House, Greenwich

Progress in the administration of justice on sound principles will
be expedited in Turkey by the example above given of the working
of our English law. That law is no respecter of persons in any par
ticular wherein its respect for individuals could in the slightest
degree incommode the Public at large. As against the Public it has
no regard whatsoever for private rights. EDMUND Pook is wrong.

these things better in New Calabar.

DUKE OF ARGYLL (owner of Iona) will say. To be sure, Iona and
Rome had not much in common.
SIR WILFRID LAWSON spoke with tact and delicacy on the ques-
tion whether the Privacy of Royalty does not tend to make Repub-
licanism possible; and the PREMIER, gracefully eulogising the
Sovereign, promised, on her behalf, that the QUEEN would exert
herself, to the utmost of her power, to fulfil Public Functions. If
what has just happened in Ireland does not convince the authorities
how much the Queen's subjects desire an opportunity of showing
their loyalty, nothing will."A Queen's face gives grace." (Scots
proverb.)
Friday. LORD OVERSTONE asked again about the Berkshire
Baffledom. Answers apparently good, really evasive.
The Army Bill was passed by the Lords. It was explained to be
now merely a Bill for the Compensation of Officers. Since Justice
Overdo's Warrant, known to readers of BEN JONson, there has
never been a document that has produced such an effect on the
Unwise as the Royal Warrant in this matter.
We finished the Ballot Bill Committee, and a most becoming
tribute was paid from the Conservative bench to MR. FORSTER for
his courtesy throughout the discussion. When W.E.G. takes his
coronet-but let us not anticipate.
Compensation for a debate on the Washington Treaty was amply
afforded by a masterly speech from SIR ROUNDELL PALMER, to whom
Mr. Punch unhesitatingly applies Lord Frederick Verisopht's
eulogy on SHAKSPEARE. "He is a cley-ver man.” MR. WHALLEY

LAW-MAKING AND LAW-SHAKING.
THERE are two kinds of Parliamentary driving,
And both at this moment appear to be thriving.
There's the art of so tooling the Session's Bills,
That a block St. Stephen's thoroughfare fills.
There are Bills by the dozen, all in a ruck,
Each in the way of the other stuck,
With the drivers slashing, and pulling, and bawling,
Opposition conductors bad names calling,
The traffic stopped, and the bystanders wond'ring
At the singular talent shown in blundering-
Till it's only by dint of cutting and maiming,
Flinging loads over, and horses laming,
That of all the train that started so merrily,
Here and there one to the goal drags wearily;
And the end, after all the fights and dead locks, is
The general discredit of those on the boxes.
That's the way of driving Bills in Parliament,
Which all who don't like delay, jangle, and jar lament.
In which a corps d'armée
might easily melt,
Or require us to serve an
umbrella per man !
There's the terms asked by PICKFORD for leading the van;
Then there's the late harvest-a fact which STORKS mourns;
But men can't risk treading on other men's corns :
In short, between crops, teams, and tricks of the seasons,
The Country has choice of a score of good reasons,
By which, while to blame no department shall prove,
'Tis clear that the troops can't and oughtn't to move.
So JOHN BULL shrugs his shoulders in blank resignation,
And owns there is need for reorganisation ;
Not so much, though, of privates or officers either,
As of blundering departments that take heed for neither.
And asks, of all ills that his Army have curst,
If Purchase be really and truly the worst?
If so trivial a cause Army movement so clogs
In KING STORK's reign, could things be much worse in KING
LoG's?
The other style of driving I mean,
Is driving through Acts of Parliament clean :
And that is an art which, in case of a bad law,
One might own meritorious, e'en in a BRADLAUGH.
But one don't so much like, when the Act made away with
Is an Act to keep King Mob at bay with,
When through the hole by your demagogue driven
A way to the deluge of mob-law's given,
To o'ersweep knowledge and right and reason ;
Drown sense as aristocratic treason;
Prove England's best posture upside down,
And the right thing to stand on, not feet, but crown.
When, with these views, demagogic forces
Through an Act boast of driving their coach and horses,
I'd fain see more substance in th' Act,
Or its letter with more of its spirit backed.
For BRADLAUGH and ODGER aren't quite the pair
That the British Lion to power should bear,
From the arms of the Roughs in Trafalgar Square.
A SERVICEABLE SOCIETY.
MANY happy returns of the other day to the Society for the Sup-
pression of Vice. It then completed its sixty-eighth year, and held
its annual meeting. The Report of its Committee “recorded a
series of twenty-three successful prosecutions,” including, suffice it
to say, the conviction of certain" advertisers, who, by receiving
payment through the post, hope to escape detection. The vile
rogues punished, the seizures of base photographs, and other like
wares, effected by this Society's exertions, are something consider-
able to show for a very little money ; £102 128. annual subscriptions,
and donations £344 10s. Its revenue not paying its expenses, it is
in debt as much as £650, against which amount is to be placed the
claim which this Society has on Society at large; one that ought to
be settled. The Committee of the Society for the Suppression of
Vice clearly deserve the thanks voted to them by the meeting “ for
their energy and perseverance in carrying out the objects of the
Society with the very limited means at their disposal.” Only fancy
the Government, with the not very limited means, comprised in the
amount of military and naval estimates, at their disposal, being able
to exhibit in return for their outlay, as much in proportion as the
Committee of this economical and effective Society is. The re-elec-
tion of that meritorious Committee, and the other Officers of the
Association whose affairs it so ably administers, concluded business
at the anniversary assembly of the Society for the Suppression of
Vice; the gentlemen re-elected, a punster, not having the fear of
the Society before his eyes, would perhaps remark, including the
Vice-Presidents.
That's a style of driving through Acts of Parliament
Which those who wish splendour to Britain's star lament.
But query if Ministers don't show the way to't,
Who threaten the mob first, and then give way to 't.
Unfortunate Choice.
Petroleum and Police.
If the comfort of the soldiers had been the main consideration COMMUNIST incendiarism in Paris has originated a new news-
with the War Office, the authorities there would certainly not have paper-heading for reports of fires — “Petroliana.” The Petrol,

OFFICERS AND OPERA-GLASSES.
THE triumph gained by the Germans in the great Continental
Tragedy ended by the Fall of Paris, is now seen to have been mainly
owing to their sedulous attention to rehearsal. In practising the
manæuvres of mimic warfare, it appears, from some account of
their exercise in such campaigning, that every German officer
carries an opera-glass. The officers of our crack regiments are
generally provided with this instrument, too; but whereas it is
very much employed by German officers in rehearsing operations on
the field, our Guardsmen and their gallant compeers for the most
part limit their use of Opera-glasses to the Opera,

THE TRUTH AFTER THOMSON.
(As Versed by a Modern Athenian.)
MORE blest than ancient, modern Athens see,
Beneath a douche of wisdom, playing free,
Imbibe philosophy drawn cool and mild,
And quaff from wells of science undefiled.
But let me haste to range in order fair
Our gains-and first, the wisdom from the Chair.
The Sun 's a slowly-cooling liquid mass,
Like that which reams within my toddy-glass,
But, unlike that, hot liquid doth contain
'Twill take earth's draughts millions of years to drain.
Ah, happy Earth, thou, unlike thirsty Scot,
Undrunk, canst quaff for ages, hot and hot!
Comets are groups of meteoric stones
That rattle round our globe in crossing zones;
The light from their bright heads to earth arriving,
Due to collisions from unskilful driving ;
Their tails, the outer portions of the train,
By sunlight and perspective's laws made plain,
As in the cloud round my churchwarden curled,
Less and less dense the outer wreaths are whirled.
Thus heavenly space, like earth, to science shines,
All scored with meteoric railway-lines-
And as earth's rails with wreck too oft are strown,
Smashes on heavenly tracks are not unknown.
Life only can give life. There is a chasm
No words can bridge ... germ-cells nor protoplasm ...
Betwixt dead matter, in its dreamless sleep,
And lowest forms where life's faint pulses creep.
“But how did life on this our globe begin ?"-
O who truth's Grail in that dark quest shall win?
Perchance among the meteor hosts that play
At criss-cross round our earth, two on their way
Encountered, as might two excursion trains,
And, as these scatter travellers' bones and brains,
Down to our blank and lifeless planet hurled
The moss-grown fragments of some earlier world,
Which in their bosom might have borne the sperms
Of other skies to be earth's primal germs;
So that its earliest life our planet gains
From the lost luggage of smashed meteor-trains.
Far-fetched such an hypothesis may seem,
But science (teste THOMSON) holds, no dream.
Though sure a Scotch Professor's bound to doubt
What so leaves Genesis and Moses out.
But say, whence in those meteors life began,
From whose collision came the germs of man?
Still hangs the veil across the searcher's track,
We have but thrust the myst'ry one stage back.
Below the earth the elephant we've found,
Below him of the tortoise touched the ground;
But what the tortoise bears ? Dig as we will,
Beneath us lies a deep unsounded still :
Sink we with DARWIN, with ARGYLL aspire,
Betwixt angelic or ascidean sire,
Though ne'er so high we soar, or deep we go,
The infinite's above us, and below :

THE London School Board, on the motion of MR.
LUCRAFT, have negatived the recommendation of their
Committee that " discretionary” subjects of instruction
should be charged for in extra fees, so that the weekly
fees paid will cover all the instruction given. The
schools of the London School Board, therefore, will not
resemble the rustic gymnasium once on a time advertised
as “a new school tuppuns a-week, and them as larns
manners pays tuppuns moor.” The principle of equality
in education, adopted by the London School Board,
admits of no extras, even for accomplishments. Carried

A NEW SONG TO AN OLD TUNE.
AIR–Malbrook.
MALBROOK, French giant-queller,
Come up from your Blenheim cellar,
As limned by SIR GODFREY KNELLER,
In breastplate and Steenkirk tie,
To rebuke our way with the Army,
To rebuke our way with the Navy,
As a way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
The lessons-if you could pen 'em-
Of Ramilies and of Blenheim
Might turn vain-glory to venom,
Poor England to mortify,
At the way we have with the Army,
At the way we have with the Navy,
At the way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
As not so long ago happed in
The capsizing of the Captain,
That five hundred brave souls wrapt in
Their sea-shroud, without a cry.
'Tis a way we have in the Army,
'Tis a way we have in the Navy,
'Tis a way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
Then we've had the Agincourt stranded,
Though all men could do each man did,
And 'tis clear, to all judgments candid,
There's no one to hang sky-high.
'Tis a way we have in the Army,
'Tis a way we have in the Navy,
'Tis a way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
Then comes the poor old Megara-
How she e'er got as far as Madeira
With her worn-out plates is queerer
Than that she at St. Paul's should lie-
'Tis a way we have in the Army,
'Tis a way we have in the Navy,
'Tis a way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
So huzza for gold and for cotton!
Put Speculation's pot on,
And in barracks and bottoms rotten
Let soldiers and sailors die!
'Tis a way we have in the Army,
'Tis a way we have in the Navy,
'Tis a way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
Malbrook led Malplaquet's fighters,
And Oudenarde's gallant reiters,
Till Britain's foreign slighters
“Peccavi !" were fain to cry!
When the way she handled her Army,
The way she handled her Navy,
Led the foe, not her, to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
And after MALBROOK came NELSON,
With victory nailed to his kelson,
And WELLINGTON, Mars' fell son-
A Malbrook, without wig and tie-
And the way one had with the Army,
And the way t'other had with the Navy,
Were not ways that led to adversity-
Which nobody can deny !
Now, with ships in iron barr'd well,
And our Army à la CARDWELL,
While we grasp our sovereigns hard we'll
Let everything else go by-
Though the way we have with the Army,
And the way we have with the Navy,
Be the way that leads to adversity--
Which nobody can deny !
We'll plan our autumn mancuyre,
And then we'll fling it over,
Lest in rain, for want of cover,
Our soldiers should run-0, fie!
And the way we have in the Army
Is the way we have in the Navy,
And both ways lead to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
A CURIOUS MEMBER.
"MR. WHALLEY gave notice of his intention to move that a humble
address be presented to HER MAJESTY, praying that HER MAJESTY would be
pleased to cause a return to be made to the House, specifying the religions
professed by Her Majesty's Cabinet."
It seems that MR. WHALLEY's motion was somewhat inaccurately
described, but even as it stands it is enough to invite criticism.
It is not half comprehensive enough. He should have asked as
to the places of worship frequented by Her Majesty's Ministers, and
the number of their attendances in the course of the week; whether
they have family pews, or make use of the free sittings; to what
religious societies they subscribe, and the amount of their contribu-
tions; the views they hold as to the proper length of sermons; their
opinions on the vexed questions of anthems and Gregorian chants;
and what arrangements they make for allowing their servants to go
out on Sunday, and whether they have hot or cold dinners on that
day.
MR. WHALLEY's motion might set a most inconvenient precedent,
and lead to other inquisitive Members praying HER MAJESTY to
cause Returns to be made specifying the tradesmen patronised by
her Ministers, or their favourite dishes or authors, or what wines
they drink or cigars they smoke, or the theories they have formed
respecting the Origin of Man (especially MR. DISRAELI and the
Opposition), and whether they take sufficient exercise, and keep a
respectable balance at their bankers'; until all privacy would be
completely destroyed, and the daily habits of Premiers, Chancellors,
Secretaries of State, and First Lords, in the domestic circle, would
become as much exposed to criticism as their proceedings in Par-
liament.
There's STORKS's Control Department
Declared it to make a start meant,
But, for cost of horse and cart, meant
Of its duty to fight shy.
'Tis a way we have in the Army,
'Tis a way we have in the Navy,
'Tis a way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny !
This year we're all for saving ;
The rule is starving and shaving :
Then, price and warranty waiving,
The command is “Buy, buy, buy!”
'Tis a way we have in the Army,
'Tis a way we have in the Navy,
'Tis a way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!
HALLOO! MALLOO!
From that instructive and amusing little periodical, the Food
Journal—which, by the way, Mr. Punch heartily recommends to
his own readers — we learn that about 2000 chests of the so-called
“Malloo tea”-a horrible compound of dust, China clay, Prussian
blue, bits of stick, warehouse sweepings, and tea-leaves which have
already done duty in Chinese teapots-were shipped aboard a ship
which sailed from Shanghai for London,
Let tea-drinkers sing, “0, be joyful,” “Te veniente die, te
decedente canamus!”
This cargo represents 180,000 lbs. weight of lie-tea, which will be
a fraud on buyers to the extent of about £20,000 in money, and
who shall say of how much in comfort and cheering stimulus, so the
Food Journal suggests that “the confiscation of the entire shipment,
after examination, on arrival, will be the smallest boon which an
indignant public will expect at the hands of those in authority.”
Hear, hear! saith Mr. Punch to the Food Journal.
O'er the planning of ships we squabble,
Through official briblike and brabble,
Then yield to the cry of the rabble,
And pay for it by-and-by.
'Tis a way we have in the Army,
'Tis a way we have in the Navy,
'Tis a way that leads to adversity-
Which nobody can deny!

THE WAY OUT
BY THIS ENTRANCE
NO MEAN THING.
A CREDITABLE case of breach of promise of marriage
is related by the Morning Post in a short paragraph,
stating that:-
“Yesterday a singular breach of promise case was disposed of
at the Norfolk Assizes. The parties live at Wimblington, Cam-
bridgeshire, and the plaintiff, MR. ADDISON, and the defendant,
Miss ScoWLER, had been lovers for years."
For reasons about which the defendant had been mis-
taken, she broke off the match, and accordingly had an
action brought against her nominally for damages; but-
"A juror was withdrawn on the defendant consenting to with-
draw all imputations against the plaintiff, who disclaimed any
desire to take money out of her pocket.”
Like a man. Had the plaintiff in this case been one of
the gentler sex, we should have said that she was one in
a thousand.

A CENTENARY SALVO TO SCOTT.
And they who stooped to drink were tranced, till old things new did
seem.
From the wise men of Old World and New, to the Wizard of the
North,
When sudden on the wizard fell a darkness and a chill
From Science's bold mariners that on Truth's sea put forth,
That well-nigh stayed his grammarye, and stopped the wondrous
Turn in honour of the Magus in maud and hodden gray,
Whose world was a world of glamour, yet that fadeth not away!
But only for a moment; with new need came new power ;
And what had been a day's work once, was now work of an hour.
True Border Scot, if e'er one was, in big brow and blue eye,
And stalwart frame, and broad slow speech, and humour shrewd That was the hardest strife to wage, the dreariest weird to dree,
and sly;
And the Man showed in the Magus, and a man of pith was he :
In glow of fervent chivalry with homely seeming veiled,
When the work had grown a labour which had been his delight,
In passion for a poet's past with a lawyer's sense impaled.
What had been play for hand and head, for life and death a fight.
While Burns shall sound his Doric pipe for ages yet unborn,
Still toiled he at that labour from rise to set of sun,
Whose summer is our winter, whose sunset is our morn,
And would not put his armour off until the fight was done ;
And far as Scottish blood shall flow, or Scottish feeling fire,
And he was nigh to winning when he sank upon the field,
Still melt hearts with his tenderness, or stir them with his ire,
And died in harness knightly, and slept upon his shield.
Another name shall share his fame, another king his throne,
Almost as much for the life he lived as for the work he wrought,
In Scott, whose knightly trumpet was in wide reveillé blown;
This gathering from all regions his own gude town hath sought;
Who sung of maid and minstrel, chieftain, and man-at-arms, And where'er true worth is honoured, nor genius under ban,
Till moved to music a new birth of chivalry and charms;
Reverence for Scott the Writer, blends with love of Scott the
Man.

Still lingered upon listening ears, and died from quivering chords,
Flung down the harp and waved anew his wand of moving might,

THE London Correspondent of a provincial contempo-

asked all the Clergy of his diocese to have themselves
photographed at his expense. Hitherto, the only kind
of persons, of whom, as a class, photography has been
used to preserve the lineaments, have been a description
of " characters " extremely unclerical except in so far
as some of them might once, on occasion, have been
entitled to “benefit of clergy.” The clergy of the dio-
cese of Canterbury, photographed at an expense not their
own, may perhaps afford a few, the less amiable, of the
Dissenters the gratification of imagining them all a set of

there ought to be, we are sure, a remedy against that robber of the

LORD STRATHEDEN wanted an Address on the Berkshire fiasco, but
it was too late in the Session. LORD HERTFORD, however, drove the
nail home. We have no satisfactory transport service, and we mean
to have one. If we do not get it, there will be transport of another
kind, some night, after a fatal division, when a First Minister
announces that he will next night state the course the Cabinet
intends to adopt.
MR. MONSELL told MR. PEEK that the Postal Cards were not un-
duly delayed in the post, but that owing to their form and smallness,
they stuck in letters and packages. If people were very particular
about an early delivery, they had better not be mean, but write a
letter. A howl about a hitch that might be hindered by a halfpenny

MR. AYRTON and LORD ELCHO had a sort of rowabout the erection
of statues, but the only thing worth while was the Chief Commis-

the most humble and moderate kind. He would only venture to say
that he knew as much about Art as LORD Elcho did. He added,
sensibly, that when he wanted an Art-judgment, he applied to pro-

AYRTON and ELCHO were two pretty men,
They nagged at each other again and again:
First up jumps ELCHO, a question lets fly,
With a sneer wrapt up in it, sarcastic and sly:
Then up jumps AYRTON, with bounce and with brag,
And for ELCHO's banter returns bully-rag.
AYRTON and ELCHO our counsel may spurn,
But AYRTON and ELCHo have both this to learn-
That still to the rough tongue 'tis roughly replied,
While 'tis the soft answer that turns wrath aside :
That the world is a mirror, in which, as we go,
We still see reflected the face that we show.
So, if ELCHO would try AYRTON'S rudeness to meet,
With a little less outre-cuidance and conceit,
And would AYRTON be less of a bully and bear,
And by sparing his own sneers teach ELCHO to spare,
The House better models of breeding would show,
And two great bores to small be converted, I know.
HIGHLAND HONOURS.
MR. PUNCH's silver slipper is always flung, mentally, after a
newly wedded couple, but he seldom puts himself “in evidence"
on domestic occasions. Still, he always reserves to himself the right
to say whatever he pleases, and it pleases him to say something
about a wedding that took place on Tuesday, the 15th August.
When a lady, or her family, has not “lacked the sacred poet,” but
has, by virtue of his verse, become historical (as in the case of LORD
MACAULAY's “Valentine'), Mr. Punch has, moreover, a special
and prescriptive claim to notice any incident affecting either. A
lady whose family is very old indeed, and whose family name,
thanks to song, will be preserved as far into the future as it goes
back into the past, gracefully selected the Centenary of SIR WALTER
Scott as the day for her bridal. This was appropriate and grateful
homage to the poet who wrote,-
“Farewell to MACKENZIE, High Chief of Kintail !”
In fact, Mr. Punch considers this tribute as far and away the
prettiest which has been paid to the memory of the Magician. So
he publicly throws the silver slipper, and, again to quote (with
improvement) the Bard of the North,
“On his brave vessel's gunnel he drinks their Bonail"
Till, perhaps, howe'er nature with discipline fight,
We should see ELCHO humble and AYRTON polite;
Hear the one own that others know more than he knows,
And the other forbear to give buffets for blows:
And happier, and, eke, better mannered, would be,
Our E thanks to Á, and our A thanks to E.

AKE time to examine the wonderful picture which half embraceth this page, and
then proceed.
Friday, 18th August. Be pleased to comprehend this Vaccination question. The
Commons, at Ministerial instance, carried a clause in the new Bill, whereby a parent
who is wicked enough, or ignorant enough, to omit vaccinating his child, would
be exempted from more than two fines. That is, for £2, he could buy the right to
risk the life of his child and the lives of scores of other persons. The Lords
knocked out this clause, and he may be fined over and over again till he obeys
the commands of law and sense. LORD HALIFAX said something about "conscientious
scruples." SIR WALTER SCOTT makes one of his Highland characters, in the Heart of
Mid Lothian, allude to such things, and add, " Send your conscientious objector
to me, and I'll tow him at the tail of my boat for half an hour. Deil, but I'll
see whether the water of the Holy Loch will not wash off scruples as well as fleas."
Violence is objectionable, but there be cases in which it is desirable to be emphatic.
The Lords carried their point only by 8 to 7, but the Government accepted the decision.
In the Commons the Appropriation Bill-a formality, but an uncommonly useful
one, as it prevents a Government that has obtained money for one purpose from
using it for another-passed.
That mystic Ex Capite Lecti Bill was withdrawn, and LORD ELCHO made his last
attack upon Mr. GLADSTONE, whom he accused of all sorts of mismanagement and
want of tact. CARDWELL, the Druid, made a spirited answer, and advised LORD
ELCHO to amend his own ways, whereon MR. HENLEY administered another castiga-
tion to the Government.
Saturday. The Lords met, and LORD REDESDALE went into a review of the
Session. He meant well, that is he meant mischief, but Mr. Punch, though ever
young, is old enough to recollect how NESTOR LYNDHURST used to perform this kind
of operation. It is a reversal of the REHOBOAM process. It is the later man that
chastises with “whips," while the older one laid it on with “scorpions”—which
word does not mean venomous reptiles, as probably the Jerusalem Chamber will
expound, some ten years hence. Among LORD REDESDALE's points was his terming
the Ballot Bill a measure for enabling people to lie without being found out. Its
effect, he said, must be demoralising, and a man might have the satisfaction of
being returned by 100 liars, whom he had induced to lie. LORD HALIFAX thought
that the Lords ought to have shown more respect for MR. GLADSTONE's majority of
100. THE LORD CHANCELLOR made a weak speech in answer, but at the end spoke
out manfully for MR. GLADSTONE, "A more noble, honourable, high-minded man he

COMIC MONASTICISM.
THE London Correspondent of a provincial newspaper
states that “FATHER IGNATIUS, otherwise MR. LYNE,
is bringing out a new tale, entitled Leonard Morris ;
or, the Benedictine Novice." The hero of this novel may
be presumed to be not a genuine neophyte of that Order
by one of whose communities the Liqueur des Moines
Bénédictins, at Fécamp, is manufactured. It may be
expected that he will prove a pseudo-Benedictine novice
of an Anglican monkery. Nevertheless, we hail the an-
nouncement of “FATHER IGNATIUS's" forthcoming story,
which will, no doubt, afford a great variety of subjects
for humorous illustration.

A FREE PASSAGE.
" The Cologne Gazette says that the Directors of the various
Railways in Germany have agreed to allow Members of Parlia-
ment to travel gratuitously upon their lines between their
homes and the Capital during the Legislative Session.”
THIS is public spirited. There can be little doubt
that the Directors of our own Railways, scorning to be
outdone by a foreign country, will issue free passes
to the Members of both Houses of Parliament, directly
the opening day of the next Session is announced,
with the addition of valuable privileges as to the use of
hot-water tins in cold weather. Indeed, we should not
be astonished if the great Cab Proprietors and the
London General Omnibus Company, stimulated by such
a praiseworthy_example, were to allow Honourable
Gentlemen (the Peers could hardly look for this indul-
gence) to ride to and from Westminster for nothing, on
production of a certificate of identification from the
SPEAKER. The only objection to the gratification of
these generous instincts seems to be, that public interests
might suffer, inasmuch as our legislators would natu-
rally be unwilling to offend such obliging friends, and
so be altogether blind to the defects which may still
be found in the management of our railways and public
conveyances.
Friendly Hint to Fenians.

A SEASONABLE STRIKE.
THE present time of year has been named “ the silly season."
That such it is in respect of the influence which it exerts on some
minds may be inferred from the statement of a local paper that a
strike epidemic is raging at Leeds; and that:-
"On Tuesday a number of women employed in a worsted mill struck
without assigning any reason or making any demand. What makes this step
the more extraordinary was the fact, that only on the previous day the
employing firm had gratuitously made concessions which seemed to give
general satisfaction."
It may be questioned whether the concessions were not evidences
of the silly season equally with the strike. As to the latter, there is,
perhaps, a reason which might possibly be assigned for it, in answer
to a question prompted by masculine inquisitiveness. The women
on strike at Leeds would say they struck because they did. This,
indeed, would be a highly seasonable reply; but then, to be sure, it
is a reply which has never been out of season.

A SONG FOR SENTIMENTALISTS.
(Not a bit more Silly than some we have heard lately.)
IF never I cease to love,
The moon may change her hue,
And 'mid the stars above
The sun no more burn blue.
Among the woodland trees,
The whales their song may cease,
And oysters at their ease,
May keep their beds in peace.
If never I cease to love,
The cows may catch the croup,
While of the turtle dove,
Lord Mayors no more make soup.
The frogs may plough the main,
The tigers soar above,
The rain-beams cease to reign,
If never I cease to love.

What does this mean? It is an advertisement found

efficiency, great convenience, and great economy.
Why should we wash our vowels? How? with liquids ?
i.e., wash a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes even w and y, with
1, m, n, r.
Who are employed in the work? Mutes? If so, it's a
good time for the undertakers. But why not clean up
our consonants a bit while we're about it? Surely The
Vowel Washing Machine might be followed by the
Aspirate Replacing Machine, for putting in H's where
they were wanted, and (by a second movement) for
taking them out where they were de trop. A Cockney
friend, seeing this advertisement, observed, “Well, I've

NICE LITTLE HOLIDAY TASKS.
(For Little Ministers.)
THE Session is over,
Big Ben has done tolling;
In holiday clover
Its toilers are rolling-
Its Tadpoles and Tapers
Its noodles and nobs,
Its gobemouches and gapers,
Its sticks and its snobs.
They are melting their dross off,
Each man in his way:
Some taking the gloss off
The Ammergau Play:
Some in Scotland alarming
The forests and moors-
Some, locust-like, swarming
The regular tours :
Some their carcases stewing
At bäder and brünnen,
Their Wasser-kur doing,
Their Kursäaler done in.
Some, for sake of the briny,
Enduring the ills
Of shingle sun-shiny,
And lodging-house bills:
Some yachting, some sketching,
Some resting their brains :
In steamers some retching,
Some stewing in trains-
But in mood sad or sunny
As each may rejoice,
All paying their money,
And taking their choice.
But is man that hath reason
In idlesse to broil ?
No! holiday season
Brings holiday toil.
From the school of St. Stephen
When boys rush to play,
They must each bear his leaven
Of labour away.
So Punch as schoolmaster
Shall set each his task,
Which who does the faster,
The freer shall bask!
Though all work and no play
May make JACK a dull boy,
In no work and all play
Jack would time misemploy.
For GLADSTONE, at Whitby,
_Fine weather while wishing,
'Twould discipline fit be
To send him out fishing,
To learn, howe'er stirring,
A boat's-crew appear,
'Tis lost time to seek herring,
Till herring are near.
How imprudence, impatience,
Best skill foil and shackle ;
Leads to fouls and vexations,
In spars, nets, and tackle :
How the boat with most reason
A good haul may hope,
That can hit time and season,
And right length of rope.
Of Bob Lowe-though the fact is
I know where he's hiding,
I'll keep dark his practice
In bicycle-riding,
If he'll watch, while sharp-curving,
How keeping your seat
And your balance preserving,
Needs head, hands, and feet;
And so temper the scorn
His keen wit entertains
For motive-power born
Of aught other than brains :
If he 'll study how far
E'en a small slip may go
Equilibrium to mar,
And upset a Bob Lowe:
I'll not make him twirl thumbs
Over lore transcendental,
But keep him to sums
In Arithmetic mental
Till he learns from his leisure,
If not from his labours,
More fairly to measure
Himself and his neighbours.
To BRUCE I must set
Task of serious dimensions,
When I ask him to get
All his late good intentions,
Brought up from the place,
Which they now serve for paying,
And harden his case
Against sudden in-caving ;
And his Bills from their burial
In Limbo set free,
Make building material
For Sessions to be.
Or, perhaps, I may fetch him
Due north to the grouse,
And from moor-practice teach him
Some rules for the House-
How con-sid-er-ation
Will miss the best shots,
While de-ter-mi-nation
Each bird he springs, pots.
CARDWELL's judgment to aid
That now trusts officer taper
To know troops at their trade
From troops upon paper,
I'll send him to Prussia
For th' autumn manoeuvre;
Then, for contrast, to Russia
Or, perhaps, to the Louvre.
That by MOLTKE, true moulder
Of armies, made zealous,
He may show himself bolder
In moulding our fellows.
Then I'll take him the round
Of our stores and store-keepers,

And awake our sey'n sleepers :
Till this problem judicial
He solves in a minute,
“Given, an answer official,
Required, the fact in it !"

But afloat, shall go learn,
Till he knows, at a look,

Then I'll teach him the trick, Sir,
Sweet syrup of making,
And Daffy's Elixir
For old babies' taking;
That from fractiousness, brabble,
And shindy set free,
Time now wasted in squabble,
For work used may be.
And to teach by proof simple
How ugly is temper-

That no man in office
May follow his leading,
And suppose he may doff his
Respect for good breeding ;

GALLANT RESCUE BY A GUARDSMAN.
THE Special Correspondent of the Post at Alder-

alert behaviour exhibited by a sergeant of the Third
Dragoon Guards the other morning, as follows:-
"A horse of his troop bolted with his rider, and rolled over
an embankment into the canal. Without hesitation the sergeant
stripped off his clothes and accoutrements, plunged in, and suc-
ceeded in bringing the refractory animal to terra firma none the
worse for his involuntary bath."

and benders, and other varieties of the ringer's art,
until they were perfect in the first two bars of the Dead
March in Saul. This once mastered, they gave way
with a will.
Then came ten outriders, ushered by six hussars, each
bearing a banner with a motto, and followed by a van
covered with pictures of celebrated fat women, the Giant
of Norfolk, the Lion Tamer, and the Battle of Trafalgar
in oils and distemper.
Then there was a loud cheer from the steeple, which,
getting quite shaky with excitement, tried to come
down, and join the throng. Presently several Spiritual-
istic Mediums, specially engaged for the occasion, floated
about the top of Bussit House, waving flags. Mur-
murs. Cheers. Tears. Horses heard in the distance.
More distance, more horses. Bussit gates flung open,
and keepers, grooms, peasants, cooks, housekeepers,
butlers, footmen, and pages, all clustering about on
each other's shoulders, and hanging in festoons from
the heights of the ancient portals.
Then more outriders, riding outside their horses,
boldly. Then a troop of less daring horsemen, who,
fearing the shouts of the crowd, had got inside, and
pulled the blinds down. Then came the carriage itself,
drawn by twenty wild horses in front, and pushed up
behind by as many more of the same breed. The drag
was down, but they dashed through the little village,

ALPES SUBACTÆ.
The Mont Cenis Tunnel, begun September, 1857,
opened September, 1871.
DIVIDING seas and mountains,
Landmarks of peopled space,
Water-sheds of the fountains
That feed the streams of race,
Say, is your severing function
Drawing at length to end,
When empires shall crave junction
And race's rivers blend ?
Ocean is our dominion;
Our steam rules wave and wind,
And on the lightning's pinion
Our messages we bind.
Those seas that nations sever,
Like barriers 'twixt them cast,
We turn, encroaching ever,
To roads that link them fast.
Alps, Andes, Himalaya,
Defiant seemed to stand,
Each range a giant stayer
Of steps 'twixt land and land.
From snows, their stern brows wreathing,
Came the dread av'lanche showers,
And the fine air of their breathing
Was all too keen for ours.
In the pathway of the nations,
Each on threshold of his gate,
They seemed to hold their stations-
These warders grim and great :
Their broad cliff-shields uplifted
Like an embattled wall,
Their spears of ice, sharp-rifted,
Their swords of water-fall!
But against men's assailing, -
Pigmies of giant brain, -
Those shields were unavailing,
Those spears and swords were vain :
Vain those eternal fountains
That feed the avalanche-flow,
Still conquerors crossed the mountains,
To win the plains below.
Each range can count its victors-
HANNIBAL and his hordes,
Spare JULIUS and his lictors,
ALBOIN's Long-beard lords :
KING PEPIN's Frankish henchmen,
CHARLES THE GREAT's motley crew,
NAPOLEON and his Frenchmen-
All climbed, and crossed, and slew.
Last,-conqueror iron-barded, -
The all-o'erlevelling rail
Knocked at the gate Alp-guarded,
His knock that must prevail ;
And break-neck pathway seeking,
Along the mountain's verge,
The avalanche roar out-shrieking,
His course essayed to urge.
Then rose the bitter brattle
Of Alp and Engineer,
And now Alp won the battle,
Now found man more than peer.
But no more Alps shall quicken
To contest from to-day,
That from flank to flank, 'death-stricken,
Sees them concede a way.
Captains and armies o'er them
Have struggled 'gainst their will :
The rail's hard irons tore them,
But 'twas by fighting still.
But now the giant sentry
. Can but dead bulk upheave,
And the trains have free entry
Nor licence ask, nor leave.

To the conquerors gone before,
Whom plunder's hope has beckoned,
Across these passes frore?

Or does this steam-winged ogress
That with red eyes tears her track,
Bring Labour, Peace, and Progress,
Chained captive at her back ?
Comes she to conquer truly,
With the love that casts out fear,
And with goodwill leaven throughly
A world that hate makes drear?
And will the iron tether
She ties be that which binds
In amity together,
Men's races, toils, and minds ?
So be it; and so 'twill be:
That hope will not deceive,
If God earth's ruler still be
Whate'er he dark may leave.
Though his ways are not as ours are,
Nor tracked by them that will,
Omnipotent his powers are,
And good his purpose still.
So when wars and wars' rumours
Seem peace's hymn to drown,
And death's relentless doomers
Bring their hands heaviest down,
Through the depths of strife and sorrow,
When, as through Alps, we glide,
Comfort from faith let's borrow,
That God's sun shines outside.

A RISING GALE.
FROM Truro Election, succeeding East Surrey,
A good many people, perhaps in a hurry,
Infer an incipient Tory reaction -
Nay, only some slight growing dissatisfaction;
A little alarm at progressive taxation,
Of which the screw's partial—that is, confiscation;
A little offence at attempted invasion
Of freedom, to supersede moral persuasion-
The freedom of habits and freedom of trade,
Which Britons get angry if Rulers invade;
A little suspicion that certain disasters
Some Ministers prove of their office no masters;
A little dislike of retrenchment unsparing,
Which caused much distress with small gain from
cheese-paring;
A little annoyance of sound Liberal feeling
By high-handed, scarce constitutional, dealing ;
By rather too much stump-oration, and gabble,
And gush, on “the People" addressed to the Rabble;
To Roughs' demonstrations by humble concession,
While stern prohibition stopped Children's progression;
By conduct which e'en a political Dodger
Might deem rather too like subservience to ODGER.
At these and the like trifles, hardly worth naming,
Are even some squeamish supporters exclaiming.
But checked will no doubt be, by timely attention,
Defection that's too absurd, almost, too mention.

DESCRIBING some manquvres near the camp which should have
been in Berkshire, one of our intensely military correspondents tells
us this :-
"As the enemy was merely skeleton, we determined to examine the rear of

A skeleton enemy! What a horrid foe to fight withal! Ordinary
flesh and blood would surely shrink from meeting an “enemy merely
skeleton."

SOLILOQUY IN A SHAM SKIRMISH.
(By PRIVATE FUNKEY.)
O DEAR 'ow precious glad I am
This 'ere Campaign is only sham!
If I was under serious fire,
I should be longin' to retire.
For hevery cartridge I now burn,
I only gets the same return;
In reg'ler war now they'd be shotted,
And has I'd pot, I might be potted.
The thought would rush into my head,
'Ow soon may come a lump of lead ?
I'm likely somewhere to be hit-
Where am I to look out for it?
In one, perhaps, or t'other shoulder.
That fancy'd not make me no bolder ;
Though now I feels uncommon fierce.
What if my chest a shot should pierce ?
My harm supposin' it should crash,
What feeling would attend the smash ?
One second more, and, Gracious, O!
My leg, or both my legs, may go;
Or right, or left, from lurking foes,
A side shot might remove my nose,
A cannon-bolt into a heap
May pound me-live how long to keep?
A shell may into pieces rend me,
At once I wonder if 'twould end me.
It ain't no good to run away;
'Tis safest where I ham to stay :
And turn about was I to dare,
I honly might get struck elsewhere.
Meanwhile, breechloaders, in the field,
Instead of muzzle, comfort yield.
No more no ramrod, from a gun
Fired by mistake, can't riddle one.
So perish hevery thought of danger,
Whilst I learns 'ow to face the stranger,

it's not a pitch ; it's concentrated essence of every unpleasant

Then it struck her that it was either all a dream, or that she had
got into St. Peter's at Rome by mistake.
“Well, I NEVER!!” exclaimed MOLLY.
This observation recalled LADY BUSSIT to herself. She now
became aware of a fragrant aromatic breeze pervading the Hall,
This seemed to refresh her, and she approached the fountain which
was musically plashing in the centre. This was so contrived that
every single drop of water from the jet fell upon a peculiarly-
fashioned stone, and gave forth such varied sounds as produced a
harmony, the like of which LADY BUSSIT had never heard.
In the centre of the fountain now appeared a lovely maiden,
habited like a Naiad, who, presenting an oyster shell made of rare
Indian pearl enshrined in gold, chased by BENVENUTO CELLINI,
bade LADY BUSSIT note her name and business upon it with an elec-
tric pencil. She thought a few lines, which were suddenly repro-
duced in writing on the shell, which she forth with returned to the
maiden, who instantly disappeared, while soft music penetrated the

air. Turning her head towards the quarter whence these sounds
came, she perceived a beautiful Indian girl motioning her to follow.
She did so. Not a sound of London could be heard. Not the roll
of an omnibus, not the rattle of a cab, not the footfall of a police-
man. Yet, this was Belgravia.
At the maid's touch two huge glass doors flew open. These dis-
closed a Tropical grove. Mangoes, cocoa-nuts, oranges, hung in
clusters. Birds of the brightest plumage and most enchanting song
fluttered hither and thither, cooling the air by the fan-like motion
of their gorgeous wings.
Parrots had built in the sycamores, and were teaching their young
to speak such words as they themselves had learnt.
They had one or two varieties of cry. The sounds that LADY
BUSSIT caught were “JUFF,” “ The Great JUFF,” “ JUFF's at home.”
So she passed on

DE
BRITISH FREEDOM OF FAITH.
THE Government of Hungary has interdicted the
Bishops from promulgating the Dogma of Infallibility.
They all submitted to this order except one, the BISHOP
OF STUHLWEISSENBURG, who took upon himself, in spite of
interdiction, to proclaim the Dogma from the pulpit.
For this act he was publicly reprimanded by order of His
Majesty the King; whereupon he too gave in, and pro-
mised in future to obey the law. How glad ARCHBISHOP
MANNING must be that he is an Englishman! He and
his subordinates, or anybody else, except (perhaps) a
beneficed clergyman of the Established Church, can
freely proclaim the POPE infallible when and where-
soever they please. By the way, whatever may be said
against the Infallibility Dogma, it must be owned to be
comparatively rational. Grant that dogma of dogmas,
and accept all its derivatives. Dogma presupposes infal-
libility; or else Dogma is a donkey, no offence to the
BISHOP OF BULLWEARMOUTH, or any other of your great
High Church people.

PEACE TO PARIS.
By a letter from Paris we are informed that the
newspapers in that Capital, recording the retreat of the
Germans from its environs, mention “the satisfaction
of the people at seeing the backs of the invaders." Let
us hope that, by forbearing from henceforth to shout for
war, and by never more crying “A Berlin!” or uttering
any similar cry demanding aggression on any neigh-
bour, a noble people will at no time again have them-
selves to thank for the calamity of seeing invaders' faces,
to which the backs of a noble people's brave army have
been turned.

A Question to be Asked.
THE Pall Mall Gazette notices a hard case, a very
hard case, that of a poor woman, of whom suffice it to
say that:-
"Latterly she had been employed making neckties for gentle-
men, and on the average she earned ls. 10 d. per week, but
sometimes 58., out of which she had to support herself, the
children, and to pay 28. 3d. weekly for a small room."
This poor woman lived in Newington. It is too likely
there are more such poor women, there and elsewhere.
But how is it, elsewhere if not there, that a charwoman

SUBSTITUTE FOR “HOME RULE.”
The utilisation of Sewage is an object of great importance, and
one of no less is the utilisation of Ireland. Excuse the collocation
of Ireland with Sewage; it exhibits a contrast: but Ireland and
Sewage are, in a manner, connected, potentially, by Peat, which
might be made, by a method of usage, to subserve the utilisation of
both. Enterprise and research have given existence to a joint stock
association, under the name of the Peat Engineering and Sewage
Filtration Company. This, after a course of two years' experiments,
at Stoke-upon-Trent Workhouse, on the purification of its super-
fluities by means of charcoal, chiefly Peat, has found a process
devised for that purpose appear so likely to prove remunerative, that
it has, as our American friends say, “concluded” on taking a lease
for twenty-one years of the sewage of the town of Bradford, and
paying a rental to the Commissioners on the cost of the works. The
remuneration will be derived from the sale of the combination of
peat charcoal with the other material, the compound forming a
substitute for guano.
Suppose now the bogs of Ireland, yielding their peat for reduction
to carbon and admixture with the purified urban superfluities of
England. Imagine enough of it brought back again, in combination
with those, to fill up the void created by its removal. Barren wastes
would then be converted into arable land, and plenty would reign
where it is now impossible to grow even potatoes. The remainder
of the Anglo-Irish compost would fertilise the fields of England;
and the presents interchanged between Britannia and Hibernia
would form a lasting cement of love between the two sisters.

A STRIKE AGAINST STRIKERS.
HOME from Club meetin', lad? I'd like
To know how long ye'll keep on strike.
Till all the money 's fooled away
That ye 're a-wastin' every day?
You sits and smokes your pipe all through;
'Tis I 's got all the work to do.
Yah, you that leads sitch easy lives!
Suppose there is a strike of wives.
You've struck for your nine hours, no more.
We works for you nigh twenty-four,
Hard at it mornin', noon, and night;
If we do strike 'twill serve you right.
Don't talk a pack o'stuff to me.
You ’re Capital, and Labour we.
And as for that, if you don't mind,
And Capital leaves you behind,
Goes off abroad, or quits your trade,
A pretty job then you 'll have made.
What's workin' rather more or less
When wages stopped must bring distress ?
Look out afore you strikers make
Your wives 'ginst you to strikin' take.
A strike o' wives would be what use?
Why sauce for gander, from the goose.
ASTOUNDING INTELLIGENCE.
ARE such things facts as these thus telegraphed ?-
" Bologna, October 1.
“ The International Prehistoric Congress assembled here to-day. Many
Italian and foreign savants were present."
Or have men eaten of the insane root that takes the reason
prisoner ? One can hardly imagine what else than derangement
could have driven people to send us such a message as the above.
The attempt to realise the idea of a Prehistoric Congress meeting
to-day causes vertigo. Everybody has hitherto regarded Prehistoric
Man, if aught more than a hypothesis, as represented only by the
Neanderthal Skull, and a few other bones. Are the men of the
Prehistoric Congress Prehistoric Men? If so, whence come they?
From the Drift, where their flints are, and where possibly will
one day be found their copper caps, and the remains of their car-
tridges ? But it is idle to pursue conjecture about a subject on
which our minds are involved in inextricable confusion.
A Little Omission.
MATERFAMILIAS was rather taken aback the other day at receiving

an excess of conciseness: the addition of one word "gloves”-

A MOUNTAIN RAMBLE.
(By u Returned Traveller.)
I'VE scanned and penned an Ode on
Thy snowy glories, Snowdon,
My honeymoon, with HELEN,
Was spent near “dark” Helvellyn,
Afar from all the beau monde
I've rambled round Ben Lomond,
At noontide on Ben Nevis,
I've roved and read Sir Bevis,
I've stretched each tired thin limb on
Thy summit, O Plinlimmon,
And once I tore my breeks
On Macgillycuddy's Reeks.
Those glorious mountain scalps,
The tiptops of the Alps,
I've seen-their pines and passes,
Their glaciers and crevasses-
With fools, philosophers, and wits,
I've scrambled up the Ortler Spitz,
Made sketches on St. Gothard,
Like TURNER and like STOTHARD,
And with my cara sposa
Ascended Monte Rosa :
But not content with Europe,
I've roamed with staff and new rope
As far away as Ararat,
Where savants say there's ne'er a rat;
The Kuen Lun and Thian Shan
I know as well as any man;
I've boiled my evening kettle
On Popocatapetl,
And on the highest Andes
I've sodas mixed and brandies ;
I've slumbered snug and cosy
On silvery Potosi ;
I've stood on Peter Botte,
A rather lonely spot;
And-crowning feat of all
My mountaineerings on this ball
I've smoked-O weed for ever blest !
My pipe upon Mount Everest.
And now my ramble's over,
Here's Shakspeare's Cliff and Dover!
All Alpine risks and chances,
All Ultramontane fancies,
I've put away and done with ;
I'll stay my wife and son with,
And never more will roam
From Primrose Hill and home.

A THOUGHT IN THE TOWER.
October 17, 1871. The funeral of Sir John Fox BURGOYNE
took place, this day, in the Tower of London.

'Tis fit he rest amid your fortress-pile;
For, above battles, 'tis his nobler fame

THE Echo has printed a remarkable letter, received
by a School Board in the country, from one of the can-

defects of grammar and orthography; but these must
all be forgotten in the wonder that the writer could, at
his advanced period of life, put pen to paper at all, for
he makes this startling statement, -"i ham 305 years of
age.”
The Editor of Notes and Queries, who is sadly scep-
tical about persons reaching such a comparatively insig-
nificant age as one hundred years, should lose no time in
investigating this wonderful case of tri-centenarianism,

WISDOM FOR WORKING-MEN.
A MORE than commonly wise and thoughtful speech was delivered,
the other night, before a meeting of the London Democrats, held at
their usual rendezvous, to discuss the new mare's-nest of an alleged
movement for the combination of Conservative Peers and Representa-
tive Working-Men in a Council of Legislation :-
“MR. FRANK declared that great credit was taken by the Liberals for
giving the people cheap food, but how far was this true? he asked. The
Liberals had given tea at 3s. a pound; but meat, in place of being 5d. and 6d.,
was now a shilling a pound. He urged that the only end the people should
have in view should be the declaration of a republic, and that they should
train the people to abolish all theology.”
“See, my son, with how little wisdom the world is governed."
Yes; and think with how much wisdom it might be governed if the
plain common-sense ideas of intelligent working-men like MR.

and it may possibly be new, if not interesting, to many
other people:-
CATERPILLARS IN BELGIUM. — The provincial council of
Brabant have published a decree to the effect that, as the
regular annual destruction of caterpillars and other insects,
which takes place in February, has not been found to clear
the land of these pests, all owners and occupiers of land are
enjoined to clear their trees, shrubs, hedges, and bushes, of cater-
pillars during the month of November, it being considered that
good results will be attained by this second operation."
A state of things may arise in this Island rendering
it advantageous for British Farmers to adopt the same
way of getting rid of noxious insects as that which the
Belgian agriculturists are obliged to practise. There are
on sale at druggists' shops various powders called In-
secticide. They cost only about 8d. or 9d. an ounce,
inclusive of small bellows or india-rubber ball whence to
blow them out on bedding and furniture now, but in
case of future need, on the hedges. In addition, the
only expense then necessary will be the hire of hands in
sufficient number to apply the powders extensively
enough. Thus it would be easy to create useful if not
remunerative occupation for multitudes of, at present,
idle boy8. British Farmers have only to go on encou-
raging the institution of Sparrow Clubs, and the destruc-
tion of all the small birds which eat up the caterpillars
and other vermin. The Farmers get those vermin de-
stroyed for nothing. How much better to afford profit-
able employment to rustic youth!

Meditations after this, while in the Fly.—The heaviest load means Tubby,
BUNTER, and me. This remark saddens me.
Notes for a Letter to my Doctor.-I begin to foresee my fate. Coming
events forecast their shadows. The coming event, for me, is stoutness-stout-
ness of a peculiar kind. I used to have fat days, now I have fat hours and
fat minutes. I have had change of air, quiet, rest, walks, Turkish Baths, sea-
breezes, sea-sickness, yachting, driving. Still I don't see any permanent change
for the better.
Sometimes in the morning I observe with satisfaction that I can buckle my
waistband tight, and like it. I am light, airy, can walk along with an elastic
step. I have an excellent appetite. I partake of a moderate lunch. Imme-
diately, I feel myself overburdened. I can no more move without puffing, than
a steam-engine. A dulness comes over me. Whatever I have taken, I
seem to have soused myself in (so to express myself, my dear Doctor), and
absorbed it, like a sponge, specially if it has gravy. After that meal I am
all gravy.
Do you know, my dear Doctor, what it is to tumble into ten feet of sea-
water, and come up again with it in your nose, ears, and mouth? Imagine
the same, only in gravy. Whatever I take seems to cling to me. My dear
Doctor, what does all this mean? Sneezing is a relief to me, and my sneezes
are painful to beholders and agonising to myself. Sometimes they almost
strangle me, and my nose goes off, after a desperate struggle, like the report of
a pistol. After a sneeze, I detect myself wheezing; wheezing, dear Doctor,
absolutely, that. Do send me your advice. My own idea is exercise, but
now?... We are going up a hill.
ARION:
Or, Ye Musical “Party."
THERE went on tour through Italy
A party named ARION,
Who was, at soirées musicales,
A veritable lion.
A "party" limited to one,
He owned no entrepreneur ;
Though personally singular,
In voice he was a tenor.
And also, to accompany
_His high artistic twitter ;
He played upon the cithara-
That's hodiè the zither.
He'd come from Corinth over-seas,
A fact which, sure enough,
In big Corinthian capitals,
His posters used to puff.
So home he turned from starring it,
And none will think it funny,
That like another SOTHERN star,
He'd made a pot of money.
Thus homeward bound he'd booked his place,
With all his ready cash;
“ At Corinth," quoth he, “ you shall see
If I don't cut a dash."
Cuivis Corinthum-once he'd learnt-
Non contigit adire :-
That is, swell towns for singers small
Are as a furnace fiery.
But now supplied with sterling coin
(He put no faith in paper),
He'd show his fellow-citizens
The true Corinthian caper.
And often, on the voyage home,
Since pride he hadn't any,
By singing to his cithara,
He'd turn an honest penny.
He'd ditties to accommodate
Of every one the wishes ;
To suit the taste of men, and gods,
And even little fishes.
CATERPILLARS AND CLOWNS.
PERHAPS many, or even most, British Farmers have heard, if not read, of a
country on the Continent called Belgium. Some of them may even know some-
thing about the manners and customs of the Belgians. The subjoined extract
from a contemporary, however, contains some special information on that
subject which will probably be interesting to them the rather because new;

But they'd no ear for tenor.
They formed designs upon the wealth

And, as he sang on deck one night,
They gently heaved him over.
He fell—not in the briny deep,
But came down plump and smack ;
Still singing to his cithara,
Upon a dolphin's back.
And as the fishes listened still,
Such pluck our bard had in him ;
He quavered not, and made no pause,
Not e'en a single minim.
On to that dolphin's dorsal fin,
His foes beheld him clinging ;
Serenely as he sailed away,
His melodies still singing.
He reached his home before the ship,

BURGOYNE-MURCHISON-BABBAGE.
(BORN 1782–1792.
DIED Oot., 1871.)
True servant still to Science, yet a mark
For fewer boons than buffets at her hand.
In no scant measure these were dealt to him,
From far-off days, when he was first to range
Lone analytic heights, through pathways dim,
By lettered sign and symbol quaint and strange.
If he was given grudged means and room confined
To prosecute his task of making wheel
And crank and lever ply the toil of mind,
Until dead iron seemed to think and feel,
'Twas much in minds as impotent to gauge,
As do, his work, which to them seemed a toy,
Wondrous but worthless, till his heart in rage
The sage was fain to eat, and fierce annoy.
And those who could not measure what he knew
Nor understand his aims, could blame his mood :
Till back into himself the master drew,
And was content to pass for rough and rude,
THREE more old landmarks, reared four-square and strong,
Upon the bank of Time's fast-flowing river,
Sunk in the flood, that mirrored them so long,
It seemed they might have stood, might stand, for ever!
Landmarks of Science and of War-whose date
Runs back to the grey twilight time, behind
The glare when, Mänad, Pythoness, and Fate,
France waved her torch, to beacon and to blind.
Landmarks, that seemed to point the course which leads
From an old world of other works and days,
To this, wherein are shaped our words and deeds-
Landmarks, with lights to guide through darkling ways.
Less wise and strong henceforth our England shows,
For BURGOYNE, MURCHISON, and BABBAGE lost;
Science may reckon all to these she owes :
A Captain's place is empty in our host.
Of all our Captains, braver, wiser, none
Added such long experience of deed
To such ripe gravity of thought: he shone
A lamp full fed, unflickering, clear at need.
A Captain such as England, honouring, loves
More than rewards; content his time to bide,
Unquerulous, as knowing patience proves
True mettle: taking duty for solē guide.
Too proud to sue for place, or stoop for praise ;
Fit to command, as ready to obey;
Sagacious, open-minded, prompt to praise,
Although from Truth's plumb-line unapt to sway.
With the first Captains that our age has known
As equal he shared counsel, nor from time
Drew weakness : gnarled and grey, not feeble, grown,
Like an old oak he stretched a hoary prime.
Till a blight fell upon him with the stroke
Of sorrow's levin-bolt out of the cloud,
And strength that time defied bereavement broke,
The strong limbs gave, and the grey head was bowed !
Like an old oak he fell to that sharp gust,
When men for shade and shelter sought him still ;
Within the Tower he guarded sleeps his dust;'
His record on Fame's roll large space shall fill.
And vain and querulous, and lived a life
Scarce noted by the crowd, or now and then
Recalled to them by some sharp stir of strife,
That shot its hot bolt, and was gone again.
But let not those who helped to blow the chaff
About his wrath at the distracting grind
Of blatant organs, pride them on the laugh
Called forth by trouble of a labouring mind.
Still brave, if sore, the strong brain warred for truth,
Sworn soldier of stern Science, to her hest
Submissive, though the great dreams of his youth
Were laid up, unachieved, in brain and breast.
Doubt not he also has his late reward,
And tastes it now in that calm sphere above,
Where Statesman, Sage, Philosopher, and Bard
Drink freely at the fount of Truth and Love.
Soldier ere he was student, of the three,
The Second bore the flag on foughten field,
Nor till Peace came, of war's stern service free,
Set him the hammer for the sword to wield,
To push the still sap of Earth's surface on,
That wins for Knowledge holds of the Unknown;
And plant the flag, which tells of tracts so won,
On outworks ever on and onward thrown.
Till he left, mapped and mastered, what he found
Unread or mis-translated in Earth's book ;
irst learnt, then taught the lesson of the ground,
Alike from proudest height and deepest nook.
He brought the soldier's gay and gallant mood
To his campaign with Nature: won the day
In Courts as erst in camps ; men's loves subdued,
As through Silurian slates he clove his way,
And gathered favour from all hands, and led
A bright and busy and sucoessful life;
The honours that he loved crowned his grey head :
He made no foes, and spent no strength in strife :
Had he but lived to see the friend he loved
Returned to us from Afric's central sea !
Unfortunate in that alone he proved;
In all else Fortune's favourite was he.
AN AWKWARD COMPLIMENT.
THE “People's WILLIAM” has been invested by the Collective
Democracy and Republicanism of London with an honour which
must have much more vexed than flattered him. At a meeting of
the officers and delegates of the various Republican and Democratic
working-men's societies, convened by the London Patriotic Society,
in the Club-room of the “Hole-in-the-Wall,” Kirby Street, Hatton
Garden, for the purpose of discussing the acts of WILLIAM and his
colleagues during the late Session of Parliament, the following
resolution was voted with a generally declared understanding that
it expressed confidence in” WILLIAM“ personally, and not in his
Governm ent generally":-
"That this meeting, looking at the vicious and obstructive policy pursued
by the Tory leaders in the last Session of Parliament, and the earnest and
honest effort made by the Government to carry the Ballot Bill and to give
education to the whole people, accords to the PREMIER its hearty confidence,
in the full hope that he will still move on in the path of progress, and entirely
throw himself on the sympathies of the people at large."
It must be very vexatious to a Statesman who, while Liberal to
the backbone, is likewise Conseryative to the spinal marrow, seeking
by the reform of our institutions to perpetuate them, to be aspersed
with the homage of Republicans who meet in a public-house to con-
spire against the Crown. Suppose all the thieves in London were to
assemble at their Hole-in-the-Wall, or any other the like den, and
vote the PREMIER a testimonial manufactured out of stolen plate,
who cannot imagine how greatly annoyed MR. GLADSTONE would be
by the compliment? There is little to choose between actual thieves
and traitors at heart.

LETTER FROM MR. WHALLEY.
DEAR PUNCH,
You have not infrequently ridiculed me, but
never mind that. I don't, and the electors of Peter-

But will you longer deny that MR. GLADSTONE is a
Papist ? Have you got one of the new Sovereigns, one

He has put a POPISH SAINT upon it, in place of the

It is clear to me that he is a Papist and a Traitor.

that the author of the fine romance will supervise the

AGES OF PERSECUTION.
In the course of an appeal to a congregation at Isling-

"If any Catholic child is forced into secular schools, I shall
cause the question to be tried at law, without any expense to the
poor. Do not let penal laws be revived so as to renew the iron
age of persecution.”
Yes, “iron age of persecution.” Iron. No misprint
or mistake. ARCHBISHOP MANNING of course said Iron,
and meant what he said. What age, then, does he mean
by the “Iron age of Persecution"? That in which the
Legislature of England enacted the statute De Hæretico
Comburendo? Not, surely, with the Syllabus before
his eyes. Of course he means the age when Priests
were executed for siding with the POPE against the

and prayed exeat, which he was pleased to grant cour-
teously, yet saying (which was none of his business) that
I was as curious a fool as ever. So to Guildhall, into
which I entered readily, not being visible, which did
trouble me, as I would fain have been seen by sundry.
But, Lord,' the changes! When I dined there, we had
neither napkins nor knives, save for the MAYOR and the
Lords of the Privy Council, nor change of trenchers, and
we did drink out of earthen pitchers and ate off wooden
dishes. Now every lady and every man had a napkin
and two or three knives, and also forks of silver or
some white metal, and several glasses, and clean China
plates were handed constantly, nay, more speedily than
was need. Methought the Hall looked noble, which I
hear is the work of MR. HORACE JONES, an architect,
and it pleased me to see that the lights, (which MR.
EVELYN says be of some essence got subtly out of coals)
were most bright, and by a pretty device, some were
placed outside the painted windows, so the colours
showed heavenly. Did note two foolish great idols
called Gog and Magog, which were set up some five
years after I came hither, and which seemed to me most
barbarous and silly, fit for some fair. I did wander
through the chambers, and mark the presentations to my
Lord Mayor, MR. GIBBONS; the Sheriffs, MR. BENNETT
(the great horologer), and MR. TRUSCOTT, beside him, all
mighty affable, but methinks the most part of those
which came up did bow as if they were not used to
perform such reverence, and did the same ill enough,
and not as in the time of His Sacred Majesty KING
CHARLES THE SECOND, when you should know a gentle-
man by his manner of bowing, in which I was thought
to do well. Did see many fair young faces, also comely
matrons, and their diamonds did shine most glorious.
The hour was six of the clock, but the great Minister
of State, MR. GLADSTONE, came not until a quarter past
seven, when we straightway trooped into the Hall, to
the sound of divine music. The crowd was long of
seating, being great, near on eight hundred, but I kept

And the day 's not come yet, and let's hope is not near,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHY DID THEY LEAVE TOWN?
PHILOSOPHIC MR. PUNCH,
PEOPLE have been flocking back to town in the
last few weeks, and I fancy that they mostly are not
sorry to be doing so. To judge by their long faces when
they talk about hotel bills, and similar annoyances, I
think that not a few of them might really have been
happier had they remained at home in cheap tranquillity,
as I did. However strongly one be tempted to leave
London in July, all is not beer and skittles, when one
begins to travel. Hasty breakfasts, dusty trains, and
fussy table d'hôtes, are sad drawbacks to the pleasure of
a tour upon the Continent; and the dreary dismal
dulness of a life in sea-side lodgings is only equalled in
its horrors by a stay with one's relations.
Why, then, do so many Londoners appear to hold it as
their bounden duty to leave town as soon as Parliament
leaves sitting? Here are some half-dozen reasons, the
best that I can find for it :-
1. Because nobody can dream of being seen in town in
August.
2. Because the doctor says the children are pining for
fresh air, if not for bathing in salt water.
3. Because the duns are getting troublesome, and a
month or two of absence may render them more
courteous.
4. Because the house has to be painted, or the lease is
just expiring, and the new home is not ready.
5. Because dear uncle has invited us, and of course, as
he is rich, it will not do to disappoint him.
6. Because my dear wife's mother has promised us a
visit in the middle of September, and so I am reluct-
antly obliged to recollect that I have a shooting engage-
ment in the Highlands.
7. Because I got home rather late and rather merry on
the Derby night, and had to promise JANE a little trip by
way of expiation.
Half a score more reasons might, with equal ease, be
given, but I sincerely doubt if one in fifty of my friends
could say with truth that they left town because they
really thought they would be happier for doing so.
Well, now they may thank goodness they are safe and
snug at home again; and, excepting that their purse has
suffered sorely by their outing, they at length are as
well off as their more sensible acquaintances, who have
peacefully remained at home, in company with yours,

A PUBLIC appeal is being made in aid of the widow and unmarried
daughters of the lamented friend who so long and so admirably
directed this periodical, and whose unexpected death left those
ladies in “straitened circumstances.” It is impossible for those
who, under the wise and gentle guidance of MARK LEMON, assisted
him for years in the production of Punch, to abstain from
expressing their deep gratification at the warm and generous
tributes which the announcement has called forth to the character
and to the labours of their lost friend. All that has been so
kindly said in his honour they gratefully confirm, and they
deeply regret that they have also to confirm the assurance that
there is urgent necessity for such an appeal.
A DIVE OF DISCOVERY.
WHEN aboard the Megæra blue Neptune rushed in,
O'ertaxing the donkeys,* o'erpowering the pumps,
While the patched-up old storeship's sore oxydised skin
Was coming away from her girders in lumps,
Gallant THRUPP, when each dodge and device he had tried,
With patch, plate, and screw rotten stuff to make sound,
Had a well-equipped diver slung over the side,
To examine her hull, and report what he found.
Under water a nice state of things met his eye,
Though the trim-kept old barkey showed ship-shape above ;
Near the hole, pits in patches; the ship's skin hard by
So weak that his knife through the plates he could shove.
And besides the main leak, whence the scarf-skin had dropped,
A hopeful provision of leaks soon to be,
* Subordinate engines, which do most of the hard and dirty work aboard
ship, as on shore-commonly called “donkeys" for their pains.
THRUPP heard the report: never pulled a wry face:
Took the facts, weighed them fairly, then made up his mind:
Called his blue jackets aft, laid before them the case,
Steered a course for St. Paul's, and defied wave and wind !
With leak and with gale-miles a thousand he strove,
Till—when anchors and cables and pluck could no more,
And into Death's jaws a sheer hulk the ship drove,-
He got full steam on her, and drove her ashore.
The last man on the wreck, off the island the last :
Not a hardship or toil, but he took lion's share ;
The only distinction 'twixt aft and fore mast,
Was, the higher the station, the heavier the care.
So he cheered and commanded and worked with his crew,
And his officers followed their noble “old man;"
And one heart, high and low, welded all tight and true,
Till to well-deserved rescue their long trial ran.
And now gallant THRUPP the grim farce has gone through
_Of surrend'ring his sword and receiving it back;
Has stood pris'ner, court-martialled for saying his crew,
With all England his witness, if witness he lack.
But might not John BULL from this case take a hint,
With a certain expensive old hulk in Whitehall,
Whose bottom some very bad plates must have in't,
It so leaks, and no patching can mend it at all ?
What if, this time, for once not content with the patch,
That we always screw on, but to prove a new sell,
We sent down a diver—the best we can catch-
To examine her hull, under water as well.
Rotten plate, missing bolt-work of time, fool or knave-
To find out-while the ship is in dock not at sea-
So our future Megæras and Monarchs to save,
And BRITANNIA make strong, as she looks and should be.

“THIS TUNE GOES MANLY.”
Macbeth.
LORD MACDUFF's coming of age has just been cele-
brated in the North, and Mr. Punch begs leave to con-
gratulate the owner of a name that will live (thanks to a
Warwickshire man) while anything lives in this dis-
tracted orb. That the poetry in which LORD KINTORE,
who proposed the young nobleman's health, invited him
to reply, may live as long, Mr. Punch reproduces it
from the Inverness Courier :-
• Come on, MACDUFF; come on, MACDUFF,
Thy heart is made of right good stuff;
I think you have some words and more,
And thus will end your friend KINTORE."
“What was lost is safe” (LORD KINTORE knows the
words, and they refer to a very good deed done by an
ancestress of his), and verses which might have been lost
are now quite safe. The speech in which they occur was
about as jolly a speech as an old friend could make
concerning a young one, and the maker had looked into
his SHAKSPEARE to good purpose, and had seen that the
Bard was not only for a coming of age, but for all time.
As the heir to the Fife estates is to come into Parlia-
ment, we presume that his father's Secretary will
remark, looking some morning through the letters, -
“'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
MACDUFF is gone to England."
We shall be happy to welcome him to Westminster,
where we doubt not he will soon get rid of the rather
amazing modesty which induced him to say, on receiving
the freedom of Banff, that he felt it an honour to be
the burgess enrolled next after the HOME SECRETARY.

PUNCH'S REVIEW.
Punch's Pocket-Book for 1872.-Rarely has fallen under our
notice so perfect a gem of artistic and literary art as this charming
volume, and it is our impartial and unbiassed opinion that this is the
Book of the Season. The names of the artists who have contributed
a mass of the most delectable pictures ever seen are known to us,
and therefore in order to avoid the slightest suspicion of being
influenced, we will merely say, that whether we regard the illustra-
tions to this album for their fancy, grace, taste, brilliancy, ease,
power, finish, or finesse, we are equally amazed at the genius which
has been exhibited by the gifted artists. But the literary composi-
tions are anonymous, and we have no guess at their authorship, and
therefore we may praise them without laying ourselves open to a
charge of flattery. We have no guess at the owners of the pens that
have shed such a profusion of sparkles. There are dramas, any
one of which would make a manager's fortune, ghost stories that
would freeze the blood under a tropical sky, fairy tales that might
excite the envy of Hans ANDERSEN (could he feel that passion),
lyrics which deserve an immortality, and satires that will attain
one. We imitate the graceful reticence of contemporary critics in
speaking guardedly of that which we admire, and in avoiding any-
thing like puff, which indeed were superfluous in the case of this
volume, but we will say that the production is simply amazing. We
observe that a considerable addition is made to the usual quantity of
literature, and if we could find it in our heart to complain of the
Editor, whoever he may be, we should gently reproach him with
having given us twenty times too much for the coin which pur-
chases the buok. No gentleman's pocket, no lady's desk, can be
without it.

A CLERICAL SCANDAL.
THE REVEREND EPHRAIM OXYMEL
Delivered sermons sweet,
Of decided yet of pensive tone,
At St. Stiggins's, Walker Street.

Poor EPHRAIM was a dreary soul,
But as sterling and true a fellow
As ever lived in Alpaca coat,
With a gingham umbrella.
CCO0
He was a feeble-minded youth,
Much given to medicines tonic;
And always suffered more or less,
With mild bronchitis-chronic.
Whilst every vendor of nostrums quack
Or patent medicine sell-
Held flattering testimonials
From the REVEREND OXYMEL.'
11904|OQUOQ
He'd stewed himself in Turkish Baths,
He had bathed in sewers at Margate;
And riddled himself with globules,
Like a homoeopathic target.
Yet still he coughed whene'er he blew
His mild St. Stiggins' trumpet ;
And suffered with dyspepsia from
A single buttered crumpet.
There were three spinsters of Gorgon mien,
Whom some irreverent gamin
Called, as they passed up Gower Street,
“Plague, Pestilence, and Famine."
It was their fate in olden times,
When they affected balls,
Like great ungathered straggling flowers,
To decorate the walls.
SPECIAL OCCASION.
“ WELL, BY RIGHTS, THEY GOES DOWN-STAIRS FOR JAMES TO BRUSH; BUT
WHEN WE'RE VERY LATE OF A MORNING, I JUST TAKES 'EM UP, AND SHAKES
'EM, AND PUTS 'EM Down AGAIN.”
So they discovered ball-rooms were
A snare; and champagne as well:
And abandoned both, and took instead
To tea-and to OXYMEL.
One eve these spinsters had been out,
Of dreary tracts in quest,
And then returned, as evening fell,
Towards their spinster nest.
They met the Reverend EPHRAIM,
And-no, I am not joking-
The Reverend EPHRAIM had a pipe--
Yes, OXYMEL was smoking !
They frowned and cut him, cut him dead,
Firmness they had no lack o'-
Can saintly odours co-exist,
With odours of tobacco ?
And from that hour poor OXYMEL,
Was scowled on at St. Stiggins;
Whilst his “superior" poured on him
Each day no end of "wiggings.”,
He meekly bore it, for he had
No worldly guile or cunning;
And who can stop three spinster-tongues,
When once they're set a-running ?
They proved too much for OXYMEL,
That gentlest creature breathin',
So he bolted to the Antipodes,
To convert colonial heathen.
Leaving behind a little note :-
“ The truth I now indite is
I was smoking Datura tatula,
To cure my mild bronchitis.”
The ladies, just as changeable,
As any youthful friskers,
Now pet the Curate who came instead,
A Giant,—with ducks of whiskers.
FASHIONABLE RETRENCHMENT.
THERE is no nonsense, to speak of, this month in Le Follet's “ Fashions
for December.” But there occurs a noteworthy passage-subjoined with a note,
by an Old Brute :-
“Skirts intended for only in-door wear are made very long, with the exception of
dancing-dresses. The latter rest only a few inches on the ground—a decree of la Mode for
which, we are sure, our partners will feel very grateful.”
Their gratitude to “la Mode” will be that of men who are thankful for small
mercies. Skirts that trail “only a few inches” are quite long enough to be
trodden upon, or to give more trouble in the avoidance of treading upon them
than the partnership of the wearer can, except rarely, be worth. In conceding
curtailment of a few inches of draggletail, “la Mode "shows herself no respecter
of saws. She knows that when she gives an inch, the recipients of that con-
cession are powerless to take an ell. This is true both as regards her slaves
and their partners. The latter are out of the question, and the former, all
but the angelic few endowed with reason and free-will, can no more shorten
the skirts of their dresses than donkeys can shorten their ears.
Peace-makers in the German Pulpit.
THE Federal Parliament of Germany has adopted a Bill rendering the Clergy
of all denominations liable to criminal correction for "abusing their office"
by “political agitation in the pulpit.” Not even the Roman Catholic Priesthood
itself will be exempt from the operation of this measure if any of them incur
its penalties, which of course none will ; because, as everybody knows perfectly
well, they all at all times in all places, preach respect for the constituted
authorities, and are, without exception utterly incapable of abusing their office
in the pulpit by abusing the Government.

VICTOR AT ROME.
“The session of the Italian Parliament was opened yesterday at Rome by
KING VICTOR-EMMANUEL in person."--Telegraphic Despatch of Monday,
Nov. 27.
BEHOLD a work done, and a work to do,
From the Quirinal, Italy's crown'd King,
Past Rome's grey ruins, Rome's glad thousands through,
To the Citorian Mount his people bring.
Where, in her sun-lit gold and heavenly blue,
Fair Italy awaits the bridal ring.
His Queen, long wrestled for, now only won,
From bonds, from bars, from death-in-life redeemed,
Whose eyes, yet dungeon-dimmed, scarce brook the sun,
Whose hopes, that oft for truth took what they dreamed,
Scarce trust assurance of new life begun,
For fair limbs prison-cramped and fetter-seamed.
Beauty that Roman, Vandal, Hun, and Goth
German and Frank, have lusted to possess,
And, as lust will, from surfeit, turned to loathe,
What they had trod and torn in fierce caress.
Oft loved, oft lusted for, and oft betrayed, -
Slave and Sultana : favourite of the hour,
For charms, and arts that help the wanton's trade,
But ne'er till now, entrenched behind the power
Of a true man's heart, and a brave man's blade,
With honoured wifehood's happy home, for dower.
Look back upon the lessons of thy life,
Its tale of treason, wantonness, and woe,
Of weakness, sequel on distrust and strife,
And unfaith, ever crowned with overthrow:
Ages not more with sins than sorrows rife ;
Shameful caress, and but less shameful blow.
Look forward to thy life that is to be,
If to him and thyself thou art as true
As he, thy VICTOR, still hath been to thee,
When rest shall strength for toil in the renew
On lovely arts, and fruitful industry,
And Church made pure, and State purged through and through.
One work is done : more work to do remains :
Thou standest at the parting of the ways:
For journeying in the right one gird thy reins,
Which old use has made slack, and scorn delays;
And sow thy seed, nor doubt, but trust the gains
Of harvest, golden crown of toilsome days!
Let the old Priest whom thou hast thrust aside,
Out of thy way, into his convent cell,
Gibber and groan, and, warnings duly cried,
Speak thee Anathema with book and bell, -
For him and thee thy Roman home is wide,
He, too, has work—so he but do it well.
VICTOR and Italy, bridegroom and bride,
Clasp hands in Rome at last! In throb and dart
Swift to its centre life's tumultuous tide
Comes sweeping! With flushed face, and lips apart,
Loosing her long-pent floods of joy and pride,
She looks the rapture that o'erflows her heart.
For this her rugged King, of manners rude,
Heavy of frame, of features coarse and stern,
His bride so hardly won, so hotly wooed,
Doth her lord's beauty in his deeds discern.
In her Ré Galantuomo's constant mood
How safe her trust she has not now to learn.
To such firm strength should beauty plight her troth,
Beauty that has bred bale and bitterness :

For the obloquy which SIR CHARLES DILKE has in-
curred among gentlemen by his recent attack on the
QUEEN, he has amends in the sympathy of which an
instance is given in the newspaper paragraph below
quoted :
“ COMMUNISM IN LONDON. - The Reds' of Clerkenwell
assembled in some force yesterday (Sunday), in order to express
their views respecting the execution of ROSSEL and his com-
panions. Citizen P. JOHNSON was called to the chair; and,
before proceeding to the business of the day, a vote of thanks to
Citizen SIR CHARLES DILKE, for his services to the cause, was
carried amid applause.”
That there may be no mistake about the cause to
which the Republican Baronet is credited with services
by the “Reds” of Clerkenwell, observe that, those
gentlemen having voted the foregoing resolution :-
"Afterwards a vote of sympathy with the families of the
Communists executed last week was proposed by the Citizen
Chairman, who cordially vituperated the Versailles Govern-
ment, defended the execution of the hostages in Paris, and
said that the four men shot last week had bequeathed a noble
example to posterity, and had shown how honest men can die.”
The cause, then, to which SIR CHARLES DILKE, by
his attacks on the Throne, and the Lady who occupies it,
has, in the opinion of his Red partisans, rendered
services, is not only that for which ROSSEL suffered, but
also that for which were shot with him two assassins,
who should rather have been hanged. The eulogist
of DILKE “defended the execution of the hostages in
Paris.”
Will CITIZEN DILKE disavow, or does he acknow-
ledge, solidarity with CITIZEN JOHNSON ?

I ask this. “Eh?” replies PENDELL, pausing in
taking off his top-coat to consider the matter; this evi-
dently being quite a new idea to him.
Note.-A Stranger is valuable in a place to which
you've become accustomed, because he starts some new
ideas. I recollect a friend who had lived for two years
in what he called a Country Paradise. Stranger came
down. “Charming, eh?” said my friend, expecting
Stranger to be in raptures. “Um !” replied Stranger,
sniffing—(startling to get a Sniffing Stranger-it makes
you look about, and arouses suspicion)— " What's the
matter?” asked my friend, uneasily. “Drains all right
here, eh?” asked the Sniffing Stranger, breaking it to him
gently. Then I remember well what happened then-
my friend became nervous; he lived with cans of disin-
fecting fluid, and nuisance-destroying powders in his
hand. He was up early-he and the Stranger—both
sniffing all over the garden, and making points, like
truffle-dogs when they found anything under their noses,
and above their comprehension. Then came discussions
with gardener, groom, carpenter, bricklayer, well-sinker,
labourer, with suggestions from Builders, and sketches
from Architects; and, finally-the property was ruined,
and so was my friend's health. There's the secret out

back to that, I believe; and now when I go to a friend's
Happy Healthy Home, the first thing I do-if he glories
in its being peculiarly healthy-is to sniff. Few men can
stand it. PENDELL doesn't boast that his place is so
eminently salubrious, but I've brought him one fresh
idea to begin with. It is, “Why is your property called
the Priory?" He's been here ten years, and he owns
that no one has ever asked him this question before.
It puzzles him. He takes off his coat: So do I. He
ushers me into the drawing-room: quintessence of com-
fort. Really easy chairs. Nobody here. I sink into one
chair. He into another. Then I hear him repeating to
himself, as he frowns at the log fire, “Why, Priory?”

Methinks it looks ill to see heads of the law

And 'tis hard on respect for the law to insist,

COLLIER, A.-G., deemed his candle too big

No objection he had a Chief Justice to be,
But ne'er a Chief's place for him chanced to be free.
So, in fault of Chief's place, he would show complaisance,

He said to himself, “Why should I not stay on?
From the pension they've raised, and the work that I know,
To Judicial Committee what profit to go ?”
So, COLLIER, A.-G., saw his way shut, perforce,
To a seat in the Court of Probate and Divorce :
Which, when all arrangements so nicely were made,
Was a sell on the part of PENZANCE, I'm afraid.
So, casting about for a Judgeship to fit,
On Judicial Committee he said he would sit,
Though 'twixt him and the new-modelled bench of P. C.
Up-perked the new statute, with “not for R. P.!”
“No one sits on this Bench who has not been a Judge"-
But for that ne'er a foot would stout COLLIER budge;
“Make me judge for the form's sake, if judge I must be,
And then shift the letters, C. P. to P. C.!”

But COLLIER stood stiff, and the statute was flawed- ;

By accounts from Ireland we are informed that a meeting of the

based on religion and conformable to their feelings, has been con-
voked by the Bishop of the diocese, DR. FURLONG. The Wexford
Roman Catholics have got a Furlong towards a system of education

LAW!
In his speech at Halifax, MR. Lowe recommended
Blackstone's Commentaries as one of the books everybody
should read. The study of that or some other com-
pendium of the Law of England, showing what it can
and what it can not do, has not been urged a day too
soon, if we may gauge the amount of legal knowledge
in this country by an application made to the Police
Magistrate at Marlborough Street, this last week, by a
father, for a summons against his son, because “he was
in the habit of lying in bed after eleven o'clock in the
morning."
Of course such an absurd request was only heard to be
at once dismissed with ridicule; but the fact that it
was made suggests uncomfortable thoughts of the inter-
ference there might be with our liberty if a Magistrate
could be found weak or whimsical enough to listen
favourably to grievances which neither Magna Charta,
nor the Habeas Corpus Act, nor yet the Bill of Rights,
ever for a moment contemplated
Let us picture to ourselves some of the results of such
a misfortune. Fathers would summon their sons for
inordinate use of the latch key, for smoking early in the
morning, for refusing to take sufficient exercise, for neg-
lecting to read books in the higher branches of literature.
Sons would charge their fathers with contracted views
on the question of an allowance, with placing wines of an
inferior description on the family table, and with narrow-
minded prejudices against the introduction of bull-
terriers into the domestic circle.
Mothers would drag their daughters into Court for
encouraging the attentions of ineligible young men,
neglecting every kind of useful work, and spending too
much time and money over dress; while daughters
would retaliate on their mothers by accusing them of
jealousy, distant behaviour to poor FRED, and a pre-
mature departure from the pleasantest ball of the season.
It will be a disastrous day for the harmony and
happiness of English hearths and English homes, when
such applications as these are not at once dismissed as
“ridiculous" by “the presiding magistrate."

Mr. Brown (Veterinary Surgeon). “YOU'RE HOME VERY EARLY, MARY ANN!.. WASN'T IT A PLEASANT PARTY?"
Mrs. Brown. “ON THE CONTRARY, MY DEAR-DELIGHTFUL! SUCH NICE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW. NOT A TRACE OF BUSINESS IN
THE ROOM!"
QUEEN, PEOPLE, AND PRINCESS.
THREE HEARTS IN ONE.
OUR days have been o'er-shadowed with one fear,
Or brightened with one hope, that came and went ;
Our sleep with fearful listenings has been blent,
For the great bell through night's hush tolling clear.
With morning's light one thought in all awoke,
One thought was last to watch all brains asleep;
Its grasp on all men's work one thought did keep,
To one thought rose and fell each pulse's stroke.
Strange grief, to reach the many-millioned heart
Of this huge city, like a private woe:
Not only to our islands' ends to go,
But o'er all seas that Britain's sons dispart,
Far as earth-girding wires could tidings bear,
Wide-scattered Anglo-Saxon hearts to bind,
With men of diff'ring faiths and alien kind,
In earnest utterance of a common prayer!
Why should this PRINCE's sickness weigh us down,
As it were some dear sufferer's of our own?
Works there such might in nearness to a Throne ?
Breathes there such wondrous effluence from a Crown?
We heard but now loud tongues that said and swore,
“ We will not brook more rule of Queen or King;
And, least of all, the rule of yon slight thing,
That claims the Throne when this one's reign is o'er.”
Where are those voices now, amidst the sound
Of Britain's sorrow blent with Britain's prayer,
All for yon same“ slight thing," now lying there,
Wrestling with Death, on the dark yalley's bound?
Is not this England's deeper heart, at one
With sad crowned Mother and with sweet young Wife,
That brooks no crossing current, into strife
With the full tide of loyal love to run ?
And when, dark with irreparable loss,
Drew on the day that bears the date of woe,
And life's clogged wheels more heavy seemed to go,
More restlessly the fevered limbs to toss-
A chill o'er more than women's fancies crept,
And firmest natures owned a shrinking fear,
The rush of the dark angel's wing to hear,
As, loves and prayers defying, down he swept!
And when the night passed with no toll of death,
And the morn brought the light of hope once more,
How buoyantly all spirits seemed to soar,
How all moved lighter step, drew easier breath!
Till scarce we hold our hopes in reason's chain,
When they would hurry us too fast and far,
And chafe at prudence's restraining bar
From hasty joy, lest it be dashed again.
Not without blessing is this trial sent
To Nation, Queen, and Prince, howe'er it end;
Such priceless lessons with its suff'rings blend
Wisdom to bear them might be well content.
Has not the Nation proved the love and pride
Wherewith it guards the blessings it enjoys-
That England's Crown and Sceptre are no toys,
To be held lightly, lightly spurned aside ?
Where are 1

A ROMANCE IN REAL (ACADEMIC) LIFE.
(From our Cambridge Correspondent.)
· By the waters of Cam, as the shades were descending,
A Fellow sat moaning his desolate lot;
From his sad eyes were flowing salt rivulets, blending
Their tide with the river which heeded them not.
“O! why did I leave,"—thus he wearily muttered,
“The silent repose, and the shade of my books,
Where the voice of a woman no sound ever uttered,
And I ne'er felt the magic of feminine looks ?
“ Then I rose when the east with Aurora was ruddy,
Took a plunge in my Pliny; collated a play ;
No breakfast I ate, for I found in each study
A collation which lasted me all through the day.
“I know not what temptress first came to my garden
Of Eden, and lured me stern wisdom to leave;
But I rather believe that a sweet 'Dolly Varden'
Came into my rooms on a soft summer eve.
“From that hour to this, dresses silken and satin
Seem to rustle around me, like wings in a dream;
And eyes of bright blue, as I lecture in Latin,
Fill my head with ideas quite remote from my theme.
“My life was once lonely, and almost ascetic;
But now, if I venture to walk in the street,
With her books in her hand, some fair Peripatetic
Is sure to address me with whisperings sweet.
"*0, dear DR. OXYTONE, tell me the meaning
Of this terrible phrase, which I cannot make out;
And what is the Latin for “reaping” and “gleaning ?"
Is “podagra” the Greek or the Latin for "gout?”
“And what do you mean by “paroemiac bases ?”
Did the ladies in Athens wear heels very high ?
Do give me the rules for Greek accents, and Crasis ?
Did CORNELIA drive out to dine in a fly?
"When were bonnets first worn ? was the toga becoming ?
Were woman's rights duly respected in Rome ?
What tune was that horrible Emperor strumming,
When all was on fire--was it Home, Sweet Home ?
“ Such questions as these (sweetest questions !) assail me
When I walk on our Trumpington-Road-Rotten-Row;
The voice of the charmer ne'er ceases to hail me
(Is it wisely she charmeth ?) wherever I go.
“Locked up in my rooms, I sigh wearily 'ohe!'
But cards, notes, and letters pour in by each post;
From PHYLLIS, EUPHROSYNE, PHIDYLE, CHLOE,
AMARYLLIS and JANE, and a numberless host.
“And now, I must take either poison or blue-pill,
For things cannot last very long as they are.”
He ceased, as the exquisite form of a pupil
Dawned upon him, serene as a beautiful star.
Much of syntax and “accidence moving” our Fellow,
Discoursed as they sat by the murmuring stream,
Till, as young Desdemona was charmed by Othello,
She listened, as one who is dreaming a dream.
Now he, who was once a confirmed woman-hater,
Sees faces around him far dearer than books;
And no longer a Calebs, but husband and “ pater,"
Lauds in Latin and Greek Mrs. OXYTONE's looks.
Strange Inconsistency
HAVE we not for years past heard of the miserably insufficient
house accommodation to be found all over England ? Is it not,
therefore, astonishing that there should be men amongst us—some
of them Members of Parliament-who see no necessity for a “ Second
Chamber"?

The mischief, moreover, does not seem to have been confined to the
splendid old edifice, which may or may not have been built by
CYMBELINE, but which is worthy of any King of Britain. The
casualty made villains over bold. The local report says that a man
“Engaged in removing the effects is in custody for stealing some valuables
belonging to his lordship. He will be brought before the magistrates at
Warwick. The police found them in his pocket.”
This is very dreadful. Sir Tunbelly Clumsy has expatiated on

them in his pocket, like precious diadems? We thirst for his gore.

THE SCHOOLMASTER IS ABROAD.
EDUCATION is advancing with mighty strides all over
the land. The march of intellect has begun, and the
School Boards are in the van. Ignorance and credulity
and superstition and Folk-lore are making arrange-
ments to hide their diminished heads. We do not refer
now to London, and Liverpool, and Birmingham, and
other great towns and cities, but to a place which,
though small in size, scanty in population, and some-
what remote in locality, filled a niche in the annals of
this country, and was known, far and wide, by the
famous deeds and wondrous exploits of its inhabitants,
when the proud Barons of England were wresting that
palladium of our liberties, Magna Charta, from a re-
luctant king, and what are now busy ports, and great
marts of commerce, and teeming hives of industry, were
swamps and heaths and wild morasses, the haunt of the
bittern and the home of the crane.
The announcement that the Privy Council on Edu-
cation have issued orders for the formation of a school
board at GOTHAM puts an end, for ever, to any hopes
that may have been entertained of more “merry tales”
of the “wise men” of that celebrated village.
BILLS AND BOXES.
Now is the season for Christmas “Appeals.”

BORN, MARCH, 1800. DIED, DECEMBER, 1871.
“He reigned, he died ”- the summary
Might serve for many a king
Whose reign is void in History
Of aught that Muse can sing-
True sovereign gold the coin may be,
But, somehow, has no ring;
But this King, who has passed away,
Unmarked, unwept, unsung,
He reigned in quite another way,
Ne'er sovereign louder rung; :
Ne'er busier king held sterner sway,
Or mightier mandates flung.
0, happy ye, whose line of life
Crossed not that meteor's plane,
Whom Fate's allotment spared the strife,
Of great King Hudson's reign,
With Mammon's yellow fever rife,
And spasms of loss and gain!
When, where KING HUDSON's sceptre turned-
A true divining-rod-
Pactolus sudden, burst and burned,
In gold, from sand and sod;
Till labours quiet gains were spurned,
And “Scrip" was all men's God.
We cried, “Our King of Men'appears,
So brassy, brisk, and bold !
Sowing hopes broadcast, spurning fears,
His touch turns all to gold!"-
The crown we gave the asses' ears
Was big enough to hold.
He moved a Monarch, blunt and bluf:
To hear was to obey !
Who of us could bow low enough,
On his gold-paven way?
Lords, Cits, Respectable and Rough,
Church, Court, all owned his sway!
Pure Nonconformists on his crown
Breathed blessings unawares;
Archbishops put their croziers down,
To write to him for shares,
Great ladies by his smile or frown
Were changed to bulls or bears.
“Long live, KING HUDSON !” was our cry:
No line save his shall be !
As share-quotations ruled more high,
The loyaller grew we.
“His statue let us raise--for why?
Shrined in our hearts is he!”
And when he progressed England through,
The struggle was the while,
Who first should lick his royal shoe,
Win most shares in his smile;
Never did England such kotoo,
To kingly state and style.
What wonder, he we worshipped so
Bore high that crowned head :
