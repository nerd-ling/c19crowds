O MYENTLEMEN Arbitrators, I salute you in the concrete," said MR. PUNch, walking up to the table of the Hall of
I Congress at Geneva. “I also salute you specially. Count Sclopis, una voce poco fà ; M. STAEMPFLI, my Merry
Swiss Boy, point d'argent, point de Suisse ; BARON ITAJUBA, I hope your sangre azul is cool this hot weather."
“Really, MR. PUNCH," said the LORD CAIEF JUSTICE COCKBURN-
“And really, my dear SIR ALEXANDER," was MR. Punch's lightning-like repartee. “How are you ? and Davis, my
BANCROFT, how are you? Have you seen Mrs. BANCROFT in Caste? Capital, isn't she? And now to business, and after
that we'll go for a row on the Lake, my Allobroges. Know they settled here, Davis ? "
“I know several things," said Mr. Davis, “and one is that you have no business in this chamber."
" Rem acu tetigisti, my Occidental. My visit is strictly on pleasure. And I reckon to have the pleasure of sticking
these here Negotiations in a greased groove before I quit."
“Porter !” exclaimed the Count SCLOPIs, angrily.
“Not a drop, I thank you," said Mr. PUNCH, smiling. “We should not get it good here. A bottle of Seltzer, if you
please, with a slight dash of the liquid named after yonder lake, but unsweetened."
His exquisite good-temper-he associates with GRANVILLE and DISRAELI—was too much for the dignitaries. They
all shook hands with him, said he was welcome, and begged that he would go away until dinner-time.
“Not a bit of it, my Beamish Boys," said MR. PUNCH. “I am going to earn that dinner.”
“But, dear MR. Punch," pleaded Mr. Davis, “ we can't admit another British Representative, especially so omni.
potent a one as yourself."
“You are polite, and I'm cosmopolite, my dear Davis. Non ubi nascer, sed ubi pascor, and being asked to an
international repast I shall behave internationally."
“ You will have to let him speak," laughed BARON ITAJUBA.
“ You open your mouth to drop Brazilian diamonds, my Baron.”
“He'd better remain, for I don't think he'll go," gaily carolled the Chief Justice, with a reminiscence of a burlesque
written at a time when burlesques were comic.
“ Take your brief, and belabour away," sang the Merry Swiss Boy.
“ Come, MR. PUNCH," said the Count, “ you and I have a common Italian ancestry. Do us credit."
“ Con rispetto parlando, Count, you ought not to doubt that I shall. Arbitrators! Have you all read RABELAIS ?"
“There's a question!” shouted Everybody, indignantly. “Have five great nations sont clowns to represent them?"

"I will soon see about that,” said Mr. Punch. “When the good PANTAGRUEL was asked to decide a most
tangled, knotty, and vast law-suit, over which a hundred lawyers had wrangled and fattened for years, what was his first
order ? Nay, answer me not in words, but let me take my cooling draught, and see whether you know RABELAIS.”
As with one impulse all sprang up, delight in each face. Secretaries and porters were summoned, and every
scrap of paper, from the smallest Note to the most gigantic Case was removed into the court-yard. In five minutes all the
painted glass in the windows was richly illuminated, and the flames roared like Vesuvius.
"In these circumstances," said MR. PUNCH," and as thinking of the frozen Caucasus' will not enable one to bear
roasting, M. the Count, you might order me some ice.”
“ Icebergs to MR. Punch till further notice,” said the magnificent Italian, in a style worthy of Cosmo himself.
“ You have studied RABELAIS," said MR. PUNCA, when the fire had subsided, " and I am sure that you will continue
to be guided by his wisdom. Do you accept my sentence, in this Anglo-American business, as final. No understandings,'
mind. Swear it, with good mouth-filling oaths."
They all sent out fervent voices, but MR. DAVIS (who has had the advantage of knowing MR. GREELEY) discharged
a kuss so terrific that it tore all the other sounds to tatters.
“ Hear, and record the oath, immoral Gods !” exclaimed Mr. Punch, in a manner like that of JOAN KEMBLE, only
superior in impressiveness. “And now I shall give you a judgment like that of the good PANTAGRUEL. Stenographers !”
Then said PANTAGRUEL-PUNCH," and the pauses amid his speech were more awful than the sound : ".
"Not having read one word of the cackle just combusted, and knowing and caring nothing about the matter in
question, I hereby give sentence that England shall pay to America, on the first of April last, nineteen thousand bottles
of hay with a needle in each. Shall, on the very first Sunday in the middle of the week, further pay to America eleven
millions of pigs in pokes; and finally, and without fail, Shall, in the next Greek Kalends, remit to Washington two
billions of bottles of smoke, and one thousand casks of the best pickled Australian moonshine, deodorised and aërated.
“But seeing that America, in her turn, has reparation to make, I hereby give sentence that she shall send to
England, on the day of the election of the first Coloured President, twelve thousand barrels of the best pearl-oysters,
the pearls to be set with emeralds and rubies. Shall, on the day of celebration of the utter and entire extinction of
Bunkum, further pay to England eighty thousand barrels of Columbian Hail, and as many Birds o' Freedom, potted with
truffles; and lastly, Shall, on the recognition of the Independence of Mormonism, remit to London a hundred boxes of the
letters of which the United States have robbed the Queen's English ; a thousand of the ropes which ought to have been
used in accelerating the quietude of Fenianism, and finally, and without fail, shall pay 30 per cent. on the profits of
'annexed 'English literature.
“ And this I give for final judgment and decree indissoluble."
Everybody remained wrapt in speechless admiration at the ineffable wisdom of PANTAGRUEL-PUNCH, who had
thus SETTLED THE AMERICAN QUESTION. But what a shout went up to the Empyrean when he gently added :-
“ To enable you to interpret this sentence aright, I present you with my

latter says, “my friend, that is, he lovos

is, she loves him. Bless the English wives-
and the French ones.
MISPRINTED MORAL.- Delight a father by

ARIES, the Ram, is an iron steamboat,
Able to sink any ship that's afloat.

GEMINI, male, are the Twins Siamese ;
Two-beaded Nightingale's Gemina-she '.
CANCER 's the CRAB caught by some of a

Never that, either the "Light" or "Dark

Leo 's the Old British Lion, who keeps
Watch with the Unicorn. Sometimes he

Virgo, the Virgin, a Chignon doth wear.
How can a true maid appear in false hair?
LIBRA 's the BALANCE; your stars you may
thank
If you have always got one at your Bank.
SCORPIO, the SCORPION, 's a Critic, who

Nut with tail's point; pen and ink are the

AN AUTHOR'S P.S.
Do not think that my Recording Angel set
a precedent in blotting out that record with
a tear. He has since bought spectacles,
which prevent his tears from falling down,
and which enable him to write even more
legibly.-LAWRENCE STERNE.
MISPRINTED MORAL.-A good memory is
a good thing. A good forgetfulness some-
times a better. A poor poet received a
bank-note the day after he had declared at
dinner that he could not remember the
source of a line & rich guest was unable to
trace. Yet the line was the wise poet's own.
A Civic DREAM.-An Alderman of London
went to sleep, and dreamt that he had been
made Lord Mayor and knighted. His Wor-
ship had eaten more than was good for him
at supper, and had the Nightmare.
VULGAR ERROR.-Some people are strangely
wont to confound the followers of MAHOMET
with those of CANON KINGSLEY. As though
they imagined that the Mussulmans were
professors of Muscular Christianity, they call
them Musclemen.
DESPERATE ATTEMPT.-A member of the
Stock Exchange declared that he could not
live in Suffolk. Asked why, he said he was
sure he should die of suffocation.

Boards advance the March of Intellect !

after many years' absence in foreign coun-
tries to the family residence in Ithaca, he
surprised his faithful wife lost in a reverie

NAUTICAL MANEUVRES.
(Described by a Landlubber.)
SAILING IN THE WIND'S EYE.-In order
to accomplish this difficult mai cuvre, you
must first of all discover where the wind's
eye is, and then, if it be pr.ct.cable, you
may proceed to sail in it. It is presumed
for this purpose that the wind's eye is a
"liquid" one.
HOGGING THE SHORE. - When you desire
to hug the shore, you first of all must land
on it. Then take some sand and shingle in
your arms, and give it a good hug. In doing
this, however, be careful no one sues you,
or the result of the maneuvre may be a
strait-waistcoat.
WEARING A SHIP.-This it is by no means
an easy thing to do, and it is difficult to
suggest what will make it easier. Wearing
a chignon is preposterous enough, but when
a man is told that he must wear a ship, he
would next expect to hear that he must eat
the Monument.
BOXING THE COMPASS.-Assume a fighting
attitude, and hit the compass a "smart
stinger on the dial-plate," as the sporting
papers call it. But before you do go, you
had best take care to have your boxing-gloves
on, or you may hurt your fingers.
WAISTLING FOR A WIND. - When you whistle
for a wind, you should choose an air appro-
priate, such as “Blow, gentle gales," or
* Winds, gently whisper.”
REEFING THE LEE-SCUPPERS. - First get
upon a reef, and then put your lee-scuppers
on it. The mancuvre is so simple, that no
more need be said of it.
SPLICING THE MAIN-BRACE. – When your
main-brace comes in pieces, get a needle
and thread and splice it. If it be your cus-
tom to wear & pair of braces, you first must
ascertain which of them is your main one.

TO
OMPETITIVE
NATIONS.
MISPRINTED MORAL.-Give your eyes more
holidays than your tongue, as they are more
delicate things.
PLEASE THE Pigs.- We should like to have
MR. DARWIN's opinion as to the changes a
follow-creature njust have gone through, who
makes no secret of being a “Porkman!”
MISPRINTED MORAL. - He that can keep
his carriage is better than he that can keep
his temper.

HUNTING SONG.
(To be Sung when the Mounds meet at Colney

TANTIVY! Anchovy! Tantara !
The moon is up, the moon is ap,
The larks begin to fly,
And like a scarlet buttercup
Aurora gilds the sky.
Then let us all a-hunting go,
Come, sound the gay French horn,
And chase the spiders to and fro,
Amid the standing corn.
Tantivy! Anchovy! Tantara !

MISPRINTED MORAL-The very hoight of
delicacy and hospitality is never to ask to
dinner any one who cannot well afford to ask
you again ; you neither leave him under
obligation, nor incite him to extravagance.
Poor folks cannot see this, yet it is not for
want of seeing that rich folks understand it.
ANECDOTE BY IZAAK WALTON.-One Pis-
cator, whom I will not further name, had a
certain acquaintance who through the credit
he bad gotten by his wealth, worth, and wit,
came to be made a magistrate. Whereu pon
Piscator goes me to the river and catches a
fish, which having brought home, he sends
to the new-made Justice with a note, saying,
“Inasmuch, Sir, as you are now promoted to
the condition of a Beak, I do send you a
Perch."
BETTER TIMES. -When Woman comes into
her rights, “The Ladies" will disappear
from the list of toasts at public dinners, and
be replaced by “The Gentlemen," a lady

HEROISM WANTED.
MAN should be able to bear misfortune like
a man. But some shocks come very hard.
This is one. You went to bed none the
worse, let us say, for that extra tumbler of
iced toddy, sweet on the summer nights.
You sleep soundly, but the daylight awakens
you, and you look at your watch. IV. De-
lightful. Four hours for more sleep, and as
you turn and compose yourself, comes the
knock that means shaving-water. The hour
is VIII. You learn all in a moment. You
forgot to wind up your watch, and it has
stopped. That was the extra glass of iced
toddy. Bear the disaster bravely--up, and
tub.
A GOOD TURN.
“THE poets are the true physicians," said a
sentimental but obese friend of oura. After
you have eaten too much, go into the laundry,
and turn the mangle for an hour. BYRON
knew the virtue of this. He mentions "a
glutted tiger mangling in his lair.'
PROVERBS FOR TABLE.
SET a thief to catch a thief:
Think of this when eating beef.
All that glitters is not gold:
Think of this when that beef's cold.
Harm is done by too much zeal :
Think of this when eating veal.
Life's a jest, and all things show it:
Think of this when drinking Moet.
Happiness flies Court for garret :
Think of this when drinking claret.
Gold may oft be bought too dear:
Think of this when drinking beer.
Many littles make a mickle :
Think of this when eating pickle.
Silent fools may pass for wise :
Think of this when eating rice.
Unto Romo conduct all roads :
Think of this when eating toads.
Flog firet fault: principiis obsta,
Think of this when eating lobster.
While grass grows the horse may starve:
Think of this when asked to carve.
Shake the tree when fruit is ripe :
Think of this when eating tripe.
Fools build houses, wise men buy:
Think of this when eating pie.
Pause, ere leaping in the dark ;
Think of this when eating lark.
Punctual pay gets willing loan ;
Think of this when drinking Beaune.
Wisdom asks fruits, but Folly flowers :
Think o' this when eating cauliflowers.
Birds of a feather flock together;
Think of this when the idiot of a cook
has boiled the oysters in the sauce, and
made them as tough as leather.

IND
EASY AND ELEGANT AMUSEMENT.
Try to get some friend who is not appy
with his aitches to read this line: -
“The orn of the unter is eard on the ill :”
And then this :-
“ A art that is umble might ope for it ere."
Then tell him to go away. That's all.

OLD GHOSTS AND NEW.
OF old, around the whitening embers,
One, here and there, as yet remembers
The tales of Ghosts, at Christmas season,
Which once were wont to stagger Reason.
Those tales are told no more at Christmas,
Whose Ghosts are laid beyond the Isthmus
Of Suez, all beneath the billows
Of the Red Sea, on sandy pillows.
The Ghosts with eyes of flame and saucer
Are now as obsolete as CHAUCER;.
No Ghosts now rattle chains, nor blue light
Emit, but “Spirit Lights”—a new light.
White-sheeted Ghosts have grown mere fables.
Instead of groaning, Ghosts rap tables :
With smells of sulphur ne'er assail us;
With curious perfumes oft regale us.
They "mediums” raise by " levitation,"
And subject them to elongation,
And in and out of windows float them,
Two stories high, lords vow, we quote them.
Fruit, flowers, ice, other forms of matter,
On tables, in the dark, Ghosts scatter;
Live lobsters, wriggling eels, and so forth :
Thus their "so potent art” they show forth.
There is a lady, MRS. GUPPY,
Mark, shallow scientific puppy,
The heaviest she in London, marry,
Her, Spirits three miles long did carry.
Upon a table down they set her,
Within closed doors. What! you know better?
And we're all dupes or self-deceivers ?
Yah, Sadducees and unbelievers !
Some Ghosts, do, mortal hands compelling,
Write letters in phonetic spelling.
Some others, on accordions, cunning
In music, Home, Sweet Home, play, punning.
The grisly Ghosts of old have vanished;
UTILE CUM DULCE.
The ancient Bogies all are banished.

Others are there, though notable, less notable than these :
But first to drink the Old Year out, that to his end has come,
See Russia, blue-eyed giantess, still rude and ill at ease :
With small cause to regret him, as he pásses on to doom.
But who can tell what undrawn wells of power and strength are there,
And looking on those Nations, scarce a single face I saw
Under the brow that looms so broad below her fell of hair ?
But over it lay such a cloud as doubt and fear might draw:
And Austria, motley madam, 'twixt Vienna demi-monde,
As if all wished the Old Year gone, while yet all doubted sore
Tyrolian mädchen, Magyar brune, and rough Sclavonian blonde ; If their welcome to the New Year should be hopefuller, therefor.
Of look more gracious than her mood, more potent than her power,
Some, thinking of disasters past, worse sorrows seemed to see,
Trying all arts, and changing trick and toilet with the hour.

And Spain, still proud as when she walked New World and Old a Some thinking of advantage won, seemed scarce to trust their hold

On that advantage, lest their prize turn dust, like fairy gold.
Beneath her soiled and frayed brocades the rags plain to be seen,
Only methought that Britain and Columbia, 'mid their peers,
Stately of speech, but beggarly of all but sounding phrase,
Slattern at home and shrew abroad, in worse as better days.
Showed eyes more hopeful, calmer brows, and lips less pale with
fears :
With sidelong and suspicious looks on Russia, Austria cast,
As having clearer view than most where surest faith should lie-
Which scarce her yashmak serves to hide, see Turkey gliding past. To put their trust in Providence, and keep their powder dry.
A harem-beauty out of place 'twixt angers and alarms
As being bent to fight the fight of common sense and truth :
At the hot looks of would-be Lords, that lust to own her charms.
Nor yield the faith therein to fear, the rights thereof to ruth:
Casting about for shelter she draws where, hand in hand,
Not give knaves, fools, or fanatics, the driving seat and reins :
Fair England and Columbia, proud child, proud mother, stand : Worthy his hire to own each man who works, with hand or brains.
Time was upon each other they had turned less friendly eyes,
To recognise the Heavenly rule that various lots assigns,
But of late both have grown wiser than let angry passions rise.
But ranges high and low alike 'neath Duty's even lines :
To the side of stout BRITANNIA I see scared Turkey creep,
To do to others as we would that they to us should do,
Though BRITANNIA lifts no finger her foes at bay to keep :
To prize the blessings that we have, and others help thereto.
But, for all her quiet bearing, there is something in her air
That brings to mind the good old saw, “Of sleeping dogs beware!"
While Britain to this faith is firm, and puts this faith in deed,
Little to her how plenteous or how poor the years succeed.
Twelve struck-and I saw grey Old Time his wassail-bowl uprear, She holds a hope good fortune reared not up, ill casts not down;
As he called on all the Nations to drink in the New Year ;
Trusting the Power whose hand alike is o'er Red-Cap and Crown.

value as British voters, use to call them the People. Now
the People of the Gallery are not accustomed to read
humorous journals in which caricatures of the People's
WILLIAM, and the People's ROBERT, appear weekly. If
they were, it would be necessary for the humorous
journals to be very careful in caricaturing those popular
Ministers, lest caricatures should endanger their popu-
larity. The People of the Gallery are our flesh and
blood, but they are as yet uneducated, and apt to take
jokes too seriously. If the Clown in a Pantomime were
to tread upon a match-box, and get blown up sky-high,
or if, assisted by the Pantaloon, he presented a working
man in an arsenal with a sack, these performances, to the
occupants of the boxes indeed, would be harmless jokes,
but the effect produced by them in the electoral way
would probably be mischievous, in a gallery filled with
friends and relations of match-venders and dockyard
labourers.

Tommy. Then these are, as you say, Sir, "remarkable for their
brightness or position.”
Mr. Barlow. Yes. And in time, no doubt, I shall be able to make
you acquainted with the names and the appearance of all the Stars
in London.
Tommy. Sir, I am much obliged to you, indeed. But of what use
is it to know the Stars ?
Mr. Barlow. There are some, and those very important, uses to
be derived from an acquaintance with the Stars. HARRY, do you

Grateful Turk
HARRY was commencing the story when the curtain, being drawn
up, disclosed to them the First Scene of On the Jury.
Mr. Barlow. This would indeed be a very good piece, but for
faulty construction. Yet, for epigrammatic dialogue and dramatic
situations, it has not, at this present moment, its equal in town.
You have been silent, TOMMY, for some time.
Tommy. Indeed, Sir, I never was more surprised or diverted ;
and as for one of your Stars, Miss FURTADO,- Dear Heart! I protest
I could watch her every evening with the greatest delight.
MR. BARLOW, observing his pupil's excitement, laughed at TOMMY
in his usual good-natured manner, and pointed out to him the
example of the poor Greenlanders as worthy of his imitation.
“What is that, Sir?” inquired TOMMY.
“They are brought up to so much moderation and self-command,"
said MR. BARLOW, “ that they never give way to the sudden im-
pulses of passion so common among Europeans. And see, you have
split your new white kid gloves in applauding this young lady."
Then turning to HARRY, he asked him if he had not been touched
by the acting of MR. WEBSTER in this piece.
Harry. Indeed, Sir, I pitied him from my heart. Mr. Tibbetts
was a hardly-used gentleman. And I think that no one could have
played more admirably than the gentleman who took the part of
Dexter Sanderson, Esq.
Mr. Barlow. You mean MR. PHELPS, and you are right. It is
indeed a fine piece of acting. There is so much breadth, and
yet such a thorough finish, in this performance, that it would be

THE SPEAKER.
THE announcement that the present SPEAKER of the
House of Commons is about to take his well-earned
pension and Peerage, and that the election of a suc-
cessor will be one of the first Acts of Parliament when
it meets in February, has occasioned much writing in
newspapers and conversation in the social circle, in
competition with the Temple of Justice, Clubs for
Working-Men, the State of the Streets, and the “inso-
briety" which accompanies the festive season.
As some misconception appears to prevail regarding the
SPEAKER'S exalted office, especially amongst the young
and gay, and in rural districts, Mr. Punch, the best
“Popular Educator" has (with the valuable assistance of
SIR ERSKINE MAY) compiled a few notes on the sub-
ject, which in his leisure moments he hopes to be able to
expand into a voluminous treatise, worthy to take its
place by the side of Enfield's Speaker, or anybody
else's.
The office of Speaker is as old as the Saxon Wit-
tenagemot, but the mace now borne by the Serjeant-at-
Arms is not the one which CROMWELL impetuously
called a “bauble.” That interesting relic of a bye-gone
age is said to be in a private collection in the United
States.
The SPEAKER is in the Chair whenever the House is
not in Committee. If it be asked, when is the House
in Committee, the answer is simple, whenever the
SPEAKER is not in the Chair.
The young and the gay and the country population
have been led astray by the SPEAKER's misleading title*
—the fact being that the SPEAKER does not speak, except
on very rare occasions.
The SPEAKER hears all the speeches which are made
during the time he is in the Chair, for he must never

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
OUR POCKET-BOOK AGAIN.
The next evening TOMMY was dressed in an unusual style of
elegance: every article of his attire was of the most exquisite cut;
every species of ornament that fashion permitted to decorate his
person was his ; not a stud was omitted, nor was one drop, less than
necessary, of india-rubber-boot-polish forgotten that could tend to
render his toilet perfect. And, indeed, neither MR. BARLOW nor
HARRY were far behind him in appearance on this memorable occa-
sion, which was nothing less than that of their first visit to the
ROYAL GRECIAN THEATRE, in the City Road.
Here, from their stalls (which were remarkably inexpensive,
being, indeed, only one shilling and sixpence each) they surveyed
the wonderful sight which presented itself to them, of a house
densely packed from the floor to the ceiling.
The Pantomime was the only piece played, and was entitled
Zig-Zag, the Crooked. When MR. GEORGE CONQUEST, who repre-
sented Zig-Zag himself, first appeared, as if hewn out of the rock,
inanimate as the Sphinx, a thrill of astonishment ran through
the audience, which gradually showed itself in vehement applause
when Zig-Zag's fearful eyes began to move, as at the command of

Presently there was a brilliant scene, in which there were some
admirable selections from the works of various composers, principally
French, executed in a manner so creditable to the performers, as to
call forth from MR. BARLOW the remark that he had heard nothing
better of its kind in any Theatre this year. When MR. CONQUEST
and his son leaped several times from the stage to the top scenes

a feu de joie of humour and fun, like the last

PENDELL chuckles to himself. “Quite a

after a short laugh, he exclaims almost
fondly, “Old RuddOCK! ha! ha! Rum

If they roll- and who can promise

Cabined, cribbed, contined-
Rolling with the rollings painful
Of that pen inclined !

Think of a whole hundred sea-sick
All along the train !
Sea-sickness in open ocean
May be bad to bear,
But, boxed up in a train in motion,
Worse, far worse, it were !
So if FOWLER cannot promise

Punch takes from it anything as unhesitatingly as (to

coins. That journal said, the other day-
"There was a demonstration at Lausanne yesterday, in memory
of the soldiers belonging to GENERAL BOURBAKI's army who died
in Switzerland, after being interred there last year.”
We cannot see why there should have been a demon-
stration ; at least, if it was a demonstration of wonder,
the wonder would have been if the soldiers had survived
their interment. It was Antæus, if we recollect aright,
whose strength was renewed when he came in contact
with the Earth, but he never went under it, at least not
until Alcides had done with and for him. But is France
aware that this is the way in which one of her armies

AMERICAN INCREDULITY.
In a speech delivered at New York on “Forefathers' Day," the
REV. HENRY BEECHER, discoursing of the "Pilgrim Fathers," said :-
“That they had their faults we all know. They brought with them some
of the prejudices of Europe, and had not freed themselves from notions of per-
secution. They believed, above all things, in the existence and power of the
evil one. The devil was everywhere in their thoughts. In our modern times
we have gone free from that superstition. We of New York know there is no
Buch being."
In the early days of New England anyone who owned to being
an Adiabolist would have been deemed an Atheist. But then
there was no Tammany or Erie Ring: Plunder and fraud, picking
and stealing, are courses from which some natures can only be
restrained by the piety which firmly believes in the personality,
cornute and caudal, of Milton's hero. “We of New York know
there is no such being." Do we? We think we do, but may have
flattered ourselves.

prove that SHAKSPEARE was a lawyer, and, amongst
other passages in his writings, the two first lines of the

SAD ALTERATION.
THE Dramatist has led us to think that “Music hath charms to
soothe the savage breast," but the “Heavenly Maid” is not so
“young" as she was when CONGREVE wrote, and increasing years
seem to have changed her mood and spoiled her temper. What
other conclusion can we come to, when we find in an article on
“Music" in one of the newspapers, in some comments on the per-
formance of a young lady on the piano at a Monday Popular Concert,
the disquieting statement that she “left her mark as usual on the
audience, the music, and the piano”? It is some little relief to
find the writer adding that “this last was more than once punished
severely ;” as it is a fair inference to draw, that whatever the
sufferings of the piano may have been, the music, and, which is far
more important, the audience, escaped with only one assault.
The Managers of the Monday Concerts should consider, before it is
too late, whether they are not endangering the well-deserved popu-
larity of their agreeable entertainments, by allowing performances
which would seem to have rather too striking an effect upon the
hearers.
Nocens Absolvitur.
| THE South London News makes rather an unkind suggestion.
Thieves enter tradesmen's shops, under pretence of selling some-
thing. The News thinks that people who would be exempt from
such visits should “keep watch, and, on opportunity, hand the
victims over to the police.” This may be fair in South London,
wherever that is, but in Fleet Street we do not dispense that kind
of justice.

Harry. It seems to me, Şir, that you intended us just now to
remark some diverting jest in your use of the words "feats” and
“legs," which TOMMY, I fear, has failed to comprehend.
Mr. Barlow. Indeed, HARRY, you are quite right, and I trust
that both you, and TOMMY, will be able to utter such pleasantries
yourselves with a full appreciation of their value. I regret to notice
that Miss SHERIDAN, who, with much discretion, performs the part
of the Lady Godiva, is suffering from cold, and is, consequently, a
little hoarse. This is natural at ASTLEY'S.
Then, turning to TOMMY, and smiling in his usual kind manner,
MR. BARLOW said, "My dear TOMMY, although you have not yet
mastered the amusing, puns which I made in my recent discourse,
you can, it may be, tell me why Miss SHERIDAN resembles a pony ?"
TOMMY, whose whole attention was now given to the scene,
expressed his intention of at once renouncing all attempts at solving
this problem. Whereupon MR. BARLOW cheerfully replied that
MISS SHERIDAN So far resembled a pony, inasmuch as she was,
unfortunately, on that evening, "a little hoarse." HARRY laughed at
this sally, and, indeed, considered his beloved tutor a prodigy of wit
and ingenuity; but it was otherwise with TOMMY, who remained
silent and depressed during the greater part of the entertainment;
and, indeed, it was not until the very effective Transformation

But at this moment a vast assemblage of children on the stage,
habited as soldiers, commenced the National Anthem at the top of
their voices, which for the time put an end to further conversation.
On quitting the theatre, TOMMY, who from having been in a state
of the greatest elation had once more resumed the sober and sad-
dened aspect with which he had listened to his tutor's discourse
during the play, took HARRY aside, and declared to him, with
tears in his eyes, that from that day forward he would never rest
till he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with all the jokes
in the English language, and had perfected himself in the art of
constructing new ones.
“Your determination, MASTER TOMMY,'' replied his young friend,
"reminds me of the story of Darius and the Corrugated Butcher ;
but, as I am too fatigued to-night to remember its main features, I
will defer the recital of it till to-morrow morning.”
“THE OLD CLOCK ON THE STARE.”
TOMMY evinced a great curiosity to know whether there were in
this tale any puns, upon which he might at once exercise his
intelligence, but on HARRY's repeating his promise, he allowed him
to go to bed without further question.

THE “ PHANTOM BOARD.”
(See MR. VERNON LUSHington's evidence before the
Megera Commission.)
A DARKLING place, of shadowy space,
Reached by a silent stair;
A skeleton clock, with a dusty face,
That marks time in the air,
To five grey ghosts, in blue and gold lace,
Each in ghost of a board-room chair.
Their red-tape is dust, their penknives are rust,
The ink in each standish is sere;
Their ghost-quills glide betwixt margins wide
Of foolscap, that blanks appear ;
And their dead tongues' prose into dead ears goes,
And out at as dead an ear!
But on file and floor, and the tables o'er,
And in pigeon-holes well stored,
Are letters many, and papers more-
An ever-growing hoard !.
No phantom of business, albeit before
My Lords of a Phantom Board !
So much work to be done, and, alive, but one
To utter five phantoms' will !
The hours they run, but on LUSHINGTON
The papers are pouring still-
And how record for a Phantom Board,
With a merely mortal quill?
Those letters come by messengers dumb-
A hundred thousand a year-
To this room or that, for ghost-clerks to thumb,
And be opened, here and there :
Who registers ? None, all; all, some:
Who minutes ? Ghost-hands in air.
So, registered or unregistered,
As haste or hap may be ;
Minuted or un-minuted,
As ghost, or none, may be free;
The gathering letters have come to a head
That a Phantom Board can see !
Alive but one,-Lone LUSHINGTON
Among that ghostly five,
And all this business to be done -
Needs must when phantoms drive!
“Enough to sign,” he sighs, “not mine
To read, and still survive.”
And while he signs, and signs, and signs,
Its ghost of work upon,
In its red-tape toil the navy to coil,
The Phantom Board sits on:
Essay to seize, your grasp 'twill foil,
Looms, shadowy, and is gone!
Gone but to meet, in order neat,
As ghost-like as before,
In the navy blue, and cock'd hat a-slue,
That ancient Duncan wore,
The Phantom First Lord at the head of the Board,
And, below, the Phantom Four !
Their ghosts of orders they have sped,
Their ghosts of minutes they sign;
But of ship ill-found, or fleet ill-led'
The discredit all decline,
To the shrill "Not mine!” of their phantom-head,
Echoing their “Not mine."

May fume and fret at will;

INQUESTS QUITE UNNECESSARY.
On Thursday last week, at a meeting of the Middle-
sex Magistrates :-
"A communication was received from the guardians of the
poor of the parish of St. Pancras, stating that there was an in-
crease in the number of inquests held upon the bodies of persons
lying in the workhouse, and that a majority of them were un-
necessary; but the guardians were powerless to prevent such
inquests being held, and were of opinion that if the fees receiv.
able by the medical officers of the work houses in the metropolis
were abolished, a number of such inquests would no longer be
hield.”
The insinuation against the metropolitan Poor-Law
inedical officers of a charge of obtaining fees under false
pretences, does credit to the shopkeepers in limited lines
of business out of whose inner self-consciousness it
sprang. Of course the inquests held upon many of the
paupers who have died in the St. Pancras Workhouse
have been unnecessary. There, not very much more par-
ticularly than in other workhouses, can the majority of
paupers be supposed to perish from special neglect.
Most of them, no doubt, die of mere misery.

Brighton by the Sovereign, or by the Shilling, which would have

downs adapted for the field of military mancuvres, but so has Ports-

AN OBJECT OF SYMPATHY.
CAN a man murder his wife? The point seems doubt-
ful, to judge by the common experience of the Courts,
and the general tone of public opinion, when a charge
for this questionable offence is under consideration or
comment. On the whole, it would seem to be desirable
that we should cease to use the term “Murder" of Wife-
killing, and create a special term for that offence--if
offence it can be called. May we suggest either “Wife-
icide,” or “Spousi-cide," or "Uxori-cide"? It would
be the correlative, in cases of feminine life-taking, of
"justifiable homicide" in the case of male.
It was very touching to observe the general expression
of newspaper sympathy with an individual lately con-
victed for having pushed a little too far, perhaps, the
natural feeling of exasperation and impatience with a
wife who may safely be assumed to have been a very
aggravating person. "Poor monomaniac," "unfor-

testify to the natural tenderness of the public feeling

SOLDIERS OR SUPERNUMERARIES ?
The late SIR JOHN BURGOYNE, in a re-
cently published letter, expressed his
opinion that the Volunteers are a patriotic
force, deserving great credit and encourage-
ment," for the reason that “they may be
of immense value among the measures for
the military protection of the country.”
When, however, the illustrious Field-
Marshal, of whom all that was mortal now
rests in St. Peter - ad -Vincula, said the
Volunteers might be of immense value,
he hardly spoke in measured terms. For,
speaking within bounds, he went on to
say that “the service demanded of them
should” from the nature of their case,
“be of the simplest nature," and defined
those services to be garrison-duty, and
fighting behind fortifications.
The Post collates this appraisement of
the Volunteers with NAPOLEON's saying
that he wanted “soldiers" in the field, but
that “men” would suffice for the simple
service to which SIR JOHN BURGOYNE
limited the use of Volunteers. Well, but
if the Volunteers are no better than “men,
mortal men” (as another SIR JOHN than
that one described his regiment) and

NONCONFORMITY TO ANYTHING.
THE generality of persons consider that any religion is better than
none; but those Dissenters who have now changed their old
demand for "unsectarian" to a demand for “secular" education
appear to be very much, on the contrary, of opinion that no religion
is better than any religion, unless it be their own. But how much
of any religion have those allies of educational secularists got?
Nonconformists in general are commonly called “Religious Dis-
senters;” but those Nonconformists in particular seem to be more
accurately describable as “Irreligious Dissenters." Their Dissent
would seem to be Dissent toto colo. Those particular Dissenters can
hardly include in their number any who are not altogether the
reverse of Particular Baptists.
“CIVILISATION AT ST. PAUL'S.”
THIS was the startling heading of an article which appeared a
few days ago in the Times. What could it mean? men asked.
What traces of lingering barbarism had been detected and effaced
within the walls of the national Cathedral ? Some readers surmised
that the fees had been abolished; others asserted that the monu-
ments were never again to be allowed to get dusty and dirty: while
a few were sanguine enough to hope that the Corporation of London
and the wealthy City Companies had undertaken the restoration and
decoration of St. Paul's at their own expense. After all, it was found
that nothing more was meant than the delivery, by the Dean, of the
| last of a series of lectures on “Civilisation" in the Cathedral.

TOO MUCH ZEAL.
THE other day there appeared a letter in the Times which the
political world should not willingly let die. In type which will
keep this document from filling excessive space with matter-of-fact
detail, here it is :-
“MR. LOWE AND VICTORIA PARK.
" To the Editor of the Times.
“SIR,—The principals of this department having informed me that they
consider that my letter to the Times, published on the 18th inst., under the
above heading, and signed by me in my capacity of Honorary Secretary of the
Victoria Park Preservation Society, was entirely inconsistent with that respect
and becoming behaviour which are due by all Civil servants of the Crown to
their official superiors, I have to state that I had no intention of giving offence
to Her Majesty's CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER. I beg, therefore, to
express my sorrow for having used the expressions contained in my letter,
and I hereby withdraw the same.
“I remain, Sir, your obedient Servant,
“Her Majesty's Customs, Jan. 30. “FRANCIS GEORGE HEATH.”
Thus we see that it will not do for any subordinate Civil Servant
to criticise, even in the delegated capacity of a Secretary to an Asso-
ciation, the public conduct of a Member of the Government. If he
venture upon so near an approach to petty treason, his superiors are
straightway down upon him with an admonition, the consequence of
which is that he loses no time in eating the words which have flowed
from his pen. What would have happened to MR. FRANCIS GEORGE
HEATH had he failed to attend to the suggestion which he received
from the principals of his department? What if he had omitted to
regale himself on the meal or mess of statement which he had been
the instrument of making in reference to MR. LOWE? Is it possible
that, in reparation to the author of Budgets, the Custom-House
Clerk would have been presented with the Sack? Would his refusal
to feast on “matter in the wrong place” have been as much as his
place was worth?
The agitation for the rescue of Victoria Park, Epping Forest, the
New Forest, and other Crown Lands, from sale and enclosure, is no
doubt extremely annoying and vexatious to a Minister and a Gov-
ernment who, with a single eye to economy, would like to see all
your now wooded or open spaces crowded with dwelling-houses,
shops, and factories, and to behold groves of tall chimneys substi-
tuted for groves of trees. But those Right Honourable Gentlemen,
the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER and his colleagues, are, even
if not too Liberal, too magnanimous, to be capable of any mandate
of which, primarily, the retractation above-quoted can have been
the result. No; it has, of course been purely the officious work of
the principals of MR. HEATH's department; his immediately superior
servants, subordinate to the Queen's Head Seryants, and at present
out of livery.
I killed thy mother, Boy !
Thy father too !
Thy brothers, sisters, aunts, and uncles, who
Came in my way. But none I slew for hate,
And none for greed. I dealt the stroke of fate.
Of all our much-loved kindred we alone
Are left-you, Boy, and I! Shall I atone
For the irrevocable past, and be
Thy slayer, Boy ?
Nay, Nephew, fear not me.
Spurn not thine Uncle !
Ah! adown thy cheek
The pitying tear-drop doth forgiveness speak.
Go to the meadows, ply thy hoop and ball,-
Hark!

ducted apart from the Public-house ? The elections for the Univer-

GIANTS IN THE WAY.
(Introit Sessio 1872.)
THE fight draws near-the hour is here,
The silk to doff, the steel to don;
Breathing the breath of strife to death,
Set stiffly his high horse upon,
Against the giants in his path,
Grimly Childe GLADSTONE rideth on!
The Passage Perilous before,
The Passage Dolorous behind-
'Tis hard to say which survey more
Might lame his lance, or move his mind-
Thought of the year that dogs his rear,
Or that of foes in front combined.
A good knight he, in Learning's lists,
With pens for points, and ink for blood;
Bold to face Prehistoric mists,
Or fetlock deep, through mythic mud,
To dog Teutonic critics' twists,
Or probe Earth's youth, beyond the flood.
A stalwart warrior, too, confest,
In wordy war, where tongues are swords;
Heedless what lance he lays in rest,
'Gainst Commons fierce or stubborn Lords-
The best to him is that which best
And readiest help in need affords:
But Learning's gear avails not here,
Nor tongue-fence serves this Session's need ;
Ne'er yawned defile more dark and drear
More threatening before knight and steed :
Beset with giant shapes of fear,
Allied in hate, of diverse breed.
Chiefs of the crowd, big, beetle-browed,
Not so well-knit as huge of limb,
The Giant Ultramontane proud,
And Giant Nonconformist grim,
Expectant wait, their mutual hate
Postponed in common hate of him.
“ALL FOR THE PRIEST " upon his shield,
As legend, Ultramontane bears;
“NouGHT FOR THE PRIEST," from chequered field
Of Nonconformist's buckler glares:
But cry and shield each keeps concealed,
As for joint onslaught he prepares.

OUR ADMIRABLE RESERVE.
As to the decencies of journalism, in the special point of reticence
with respect to pending trials, we certainly are not as those Ameri-
cans are. The Claimant's case, if proceeding in America, would
have been discussed and prejudged in Yankee newspapers over and
over again. Fear of commitment for contempt of Court being before
the eyes of our Editors, withholds them from daring to publish re-
marks on a case pendente lite such as are heard in every company,
and nobody scruples to make across a table. The ability to say such
things with impunity must rather tend to lessen the great advantage
of enforcing reticence on journalists. The jurymen engaged on
Tichborne y. Lushington can hardly have gone anywhere since
that suit began and not have heard it canvassed without reserve.
Nothing they could have read in a newspaper, probably, could have
given them the slightest additional bias. They must have heard
plenty of observations as likely as any they could have read to affect
their judgment otherwise than the plain statements and unimpas-
sioned arguments of counsel can. This is a very great pity. The
licence of private conversation must render the reticence of the
Press almost of none effect. Ought not, therefore, everyone who
speaks, as well as the person who prints, a word for or against a
plaintiff or defendant, be liable to be committed for contempt of
Court, too? Or would it be a better plan to keep the Jury locked
up from communication with the onter world, perhaps, as in the
Tichborne trial they would have had to be already, for above half-a-
year at a stretch. If this incarceration of the Jury is of any use at
all in a case of felony which concerns nobody, or very few, out of
Court, it would be immensely more useful in an action involving
enormous interests. Only, as we always say, in commending this
wise precaution, when you lock up the Jury, lock up also the
Judge.
Dark in their rear, more Giants peer,
Looming the larger for the shade
Through which their doubtful bulks appear,
In magnifying mists arrayed.
The Giant Bunkum, see prepare
The biggest bill e'er Bunkum made!
And Giant Job, and Giant Mull,
And Giant Muddle, and Misrule-
Giants that, by the Office-full
Find in Whitehall their home and school, -
Big brainless Giants, deaf and dull,
That botch the business of JOHN BULL.
Ere GLADSTONE quell this Giant band,
That with armed ambush lines his way,
He'll need as steady heart and hand,
As cool head, as e'er knight in fray,
And at his back a helpful band,
Of wills that hold, and wits that weigh.
I look around at foes before,
And weak or wavering friends behind ;
I'count the Session's chances o'er,
And more to chill than cheer I find.
But as Punch wished him well of yore,
Still the old “good-speed” comes to mind.
Accommodation for the Army.
MR. SHEKELS says that he foresees one great disadvantage which
must result from fixing the educational test for commissions in the
Army too high. Young Officers have always heretofore got the
greatest credit, and now in future they won't want any.
Beyond Suspicion.
OFTEN as we hear of the “City Oratory," we never for a moment
suppose that this implies any imputation on the City's Protestantism.

IMMORALITY OF FOREIGN RULERS.
It is said that there are French Statesmen who actually
contemplate a scheme of raising £160,000,000 toward's
paying off the indemnity due to Germany by means of a
Lottery Loan. Dreadful ! Of all financial expedients
which a Government can have recourse to, there is not
one so demoralising as that of borrowing money by
means of sanctioning lotteries. Why it is an en-
couragement of gambling! What is the wrongfulness
of partial taxation to that? Certainly there is some-
thing a little tending to impair the morality of tax-
payers in a tax which they resent as unjust, inquisi-
torial, and cruel. It tends to make them try to frustrate
injustice by evasion. Fiscal imposition, they think,
justifies antagonism by fraud ; the victims and the
taxmasters are playing a game of forfeits, wherein
iniquity on one side makes cheating on the other all
fair. This is rather improper, certainly, but a tax
which, unrighteous and extortionate, aggrieves only
certain persons, does not habituate the whole of the
community to the resource of lying and cheating in self-
defence, but only a part of them, namely those who are
overtaxed. Whereas Lotteries tempt every one pos-
sessing the means of gambling to gamble. The un-
scrupulous Governments of Austria and Italy, and the
benighted POPE, may demoralise those who own their
authority by authorising Lotteries. Our own con-
scientious Rulers are far above the imitation of their
deplorable example. Never, never, we are sure, will
they be guilty of permitting a Lottery, although they
are capable of upholding an Income-tax.

HIS day one hundred years, Feb. 6, 1772, did CHARLES Fox arise in
the House of Commons, and being weary of the inactivity of the
House, and desirous to have some sort of disturbance, that he might
manifest his powers, did give notice that he should move for a repeal
of the Marriage Act. When he gave this notice he had never read
the Marriage Act, nor did he read it until some days after. You
may like also to know that just then Town was talking of the
arrest of the QUEEN OF DENMARK, sister to our King. She was
charged by her husband with certain non-conjugalities. About a
week later the Prussian Envoy came up to Mr. Punch, and said,
with a sneer, “Qu'est devenue votre REINE DE DANEMARO?” Then,
as now, ever prompt with reply, Mr. Punch answered, “with spirit,”
“ Apparemment qu'elle est à Spandau avec votre PRINCESSE ROYALE”
-who had been divorced, for good reasons. You will find all this,
or about all this, in WALPOLE, not in the immortal and immoral
letters, but in the “Last Journals,” ably edited by DR. DORAN,
F.S.A.
Mr. Punch presumes that by this time his reader, the World,
knows him too well to suppose that he would hesitate at making
any record or reference that occurred to him, whether it appeared
to bear immediately on the matter in hand, or not. If, however,
any person supposes that Mr. Punch is bound by any rule, the
sooner that supposition is dismissed the better. This delightful
Parliamentary narrative will, as heretofore, be varied and
enlivened by anything that he may deem it fit to interpolate.
He will bring forth from his treasury things new and old, as
may seem good to his generous nature. By Dodo, who was the
mother of Zoroaster, Mr. Punch will be no slave to Parliament
or any other authority, save that of Beauty! Now you know all
about it.
To-day, as here is pictured Parliament met. HER MAJESTY was
not present, being wisely occupied in acquiring, amid the pure air of
the Island of Wight, strength for the Day of Thanksgiving, about to be mentioned.
LORD CHANCELLOR HATHERLEY read the Royal Speech, and Mr. Punch reluctantly notes that his Lordship read it very badly,
stumbling, and pausing, and requiring to be prompted by the EARL OF RIPON. Mr. Punch would not, of course, have mentioned this

The Bishop never married, and it was long the practice for be-
trothed lovers to repair on the morning of his birthday to his statue,
accompanied by one or more of the oldest inhabitants of the place,
and deposit at its base attested copies of their correspondence, a
crooked sixpence or some other similar silver coin wrapped up in
a newspaper, and garlands made of lad's-love, maiden-hair fern, and
stout twine. Hence the custom of sending Valentines on this day.
The custom itself is one which exists, in some shape or other, in
every country where travellers have discovered remains of stationery;
and tablets or stones rudely incised with hearts, darts, altars, flames,
Cupids, nuptial rings, and village churches in the background, and
a date which the best scholars agree in considering to correspond
with the middle of our February, have been found amongst tribes
so sayage that they had no knowledge of the use of writing mate-
rials, and were ignorant of gin.
No connection can be traced between BISHOP VALENTINE and the
senior partner in the firm of Valentine and Orson-the families do
not appear to have been even distantly related.
This being Leap Year, if a single gentleman receives a Valentine
from a sipgle lady, and can trace the sender through the Post-office,
he will be entitled to consider her missive as equivalent to a proposal
of marriage, and to accept it, if the lady can give satisfactory refer-
ences as to property, connections, temper, accomplishments, and
ability to manage a modern mansion.
One of the most familiar formulas used in Valentines is so old that
no authentic manuscript of it is known to exist. We refer to the
genial lines, which, through successive generations, have found a
conscious echo in the breasts of all who are awake to the simple
dictates of the heart acting in unison with the language of flowers-

Glad the first fair chance to catch,
“The best rule of play to use,
Should Saw win-as p'raps he may
An old quarrel up to patch,

Without coming to the scratch

'Cute UNCLE SAM!
He and SAM.
Close kinship Bull must own
So if Bull a game begin
If Bull's penny points seemed pounds
With UNCLE SAM:
With UNCLE SAM,
To UNCLE SAM-
The same breed in blood and bone,
It could scarce be thought a sin,
Howe'er strange the blunder sounds -
By good points and bad they're shown, If for his rule he brought in,
Better own it, than give grounds

For renewal of old rounds

While John Bull is Christian, too,
That his claims are Bletherumskite,
But his purse-strings asked to pull,
Such sharp practice he'll eschew,
Sam mayn't relish owning quite-
In his ears sticks cotton-wool,
And his cards play frank and true,
But aught's better than a fight
Does UNCLE SAM.

Like Bull, hard to persuade
But if ere the first card's played
BULL has “d--d good-natured friends,"

And so has SAM,
When once down the law he's laid,
BULL finds blunders have been made, Who regret each feud that ends
One word contra can be said,
As to what is to be paid,
In peaceable amends;
That a moment should be weighed
Why to say so be afraid,
Hail each scratch, to raw that tends,

'Twixt Bull and SAM.
Like BULL, apt to forget
Whatever chance of row
But if John BULL is wise
Is UNCLE SAM,
With UNCLE SAM-
And UNCLE SAM,
Rules for others he has set,
Who like BULL can't bear to bow-
They'll not black each other's eyes,
He is somewhat given to let
Better deal with that chance now,
But their honest friends surprise,
A good deal broken get
Than a minute's doubt allow
By proving no allies
By UNCLE SẢN.
To UNCLE SAM.
Like BULL and Sam.
BULL is wise and strong enough-
If we cannot fix our stake
So's UNCLE SAM
With UNCLE SAM,
Though on points of honour tough,
Let's off match, and no mistake,
Loud of speech, and even gruff
Nor such fools of ourselves make
To feel talk of war sheer stuff
As peace and heads to break
'Twixt BULL and SAM.
Eh, UNCLE SAM?

That throne, from whose height One had then stepped down,
Whom all revered, as Soldier, Statesman, Sage :
A stern, plain, King of men, within whose frown
No lie could live, who knew all work's due wage.
“Can dwarf,” we asked, “in giant's armour fight ?”
Painted his sovereignty as an eclipse
Enshrouding India in a sudden night;
And most men's scorn, like ours, was on their lips.
Born in Dublin, Feb. 1, 1822. Assassinated at Port Blair,

"DEATH levels all!"-Untruth ! half truth, at best :
Death, with his scythe and hour-glass, well might show
Touchstone and chemic tubes, wherewith to test
The qualities of those whom he lays low.
“Let nought but good be spoken of the dead”—
Happy the dead of whom that good is true :
Anů they most happy, on whose lifeless head
Death sets the crown which life proclaims their due.
How should the slight man fill the strong man's place ?
Rise from his small routine of petty toil,
A vast and various Empire's needs to face,
And move, unhampered by the mighty coil !
They gauged him better, those who knew him best;
They read, beneath that bright and blithesome cheer,
The Statesman's wide and watchful eye, the breast
Unwarped by favour, and unwrung by fear:
The wit to choose, the will to do, the right;
All the more potent for the cheerful mood
That made the irksome yoke of duty light,
Helping to smooth the rough, refine the rude :
001 Sith hated breath We gauged
Men say, with bated breathan once
Of whom, as they lie shrouded, stark and still,
Looking upon them in their marble sleep,
How large his worth, whom once we rated cheap!"
Of these is he, for whom laid, sudden, low,
By darkling knife and brooding sense of wrong,
Truest regard sets genuine tears aflow,
That from the roots of love well, swift and strong.
Bidding the dusty paths of daily toil
With flowers of gladness and good-feeling glow;
On rusty wards of office pouring oil,
Making work's hinges with strange smoothness go.
Nor for this cheeriness less strenuous shown,
All ear, all eye, he swayed his mighty realm:
Till through its length and breadth a presence known,
Felt as a living hand upon the helm.
We took his gange, as did the common fool:
By Report's shallow valuing appraised,
When from the Irish Secretary's stool
To the great Indian throne we saw him raised.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SOMETHING LIKE A NAME.
MR. PUNCH, during a long and brilliant career, has
had the satisfaction of immortalising in his columns many
illustrious, many remarkable, many appropriate, many
| lengthy names, but he does not remember ever to have
incurred so large an outlay for printing ink as on the
present occasion, when he deems it his duty to recom-
mend his readers at once to begin to master the whole
name of the KING OF SIAM, as a visit from that Monarch
to these shores is not an improbable event. His Majesty's
card will bear the following inscription : -“PrA BAT
SOMDETCI PRABARAMAIN TARAMAHA CHULALONKON
KLAO PRA CHAO PEN DIN SIAM." The effect of this
magnificent name, reverberating from flight to flight in
some great mansion in the West, can hardly be exag-
gerated. Mr. Punch's fear is, that the British footman
will sink under it ; that the British butler will make it
an excuse for an advance of salary.

STRANGE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDING.
ACCORDING to a statement in the Globe, the election
of the new SPEAKER was marked by an occurrence
which is believed to be unprecedented in the Annals of
Parliament-at any rate, the journals of the House are
silent on the point in their account of the ceremonies
attending previous similar interesting occasions. The
statement we refer to is as follows:
"At the same instant the Sergeant-at-Arms ascended the
House, and placed the Mace reverently on the table !'
We venture to hope, for the sake of those who may
hereafter be called upon to fill one of the most important
posts in the House of Commons, that this addition to
its laborious duties will not be regarded as a precedent
to be strictly followed in all future elections of a
Speaker.
The most remarkable feature in the case is that,
although we have caused the most careful inquiries to
be made in the neighbourhood, not one of the many
persons who must have been in Palace Yard or on West-
minster Bridge at the time appears to have seen the
Sergeant-at-Arms (with or without the Mace) on the roof
of the House.

MEN would not be what they are but for women. Great
men have mostly been the sons of gifted mothers. The
progressive improvement or deterioration of Man will
essentially depend upon the continued ascent or deca-
dence of Woman. Elevation, in ideas of ornamental
art, from the absurdities of savage finery ever upwards
towards the expressions of perfect grace, is a visible
criterion of rising intelligence and morality. Chignons,
and many other embellishments which ladies have
adopted of late, are ominous of a noble Posterity. Among
prognostics of this kind may be mentioned certain objects
of natural history, which have recently, as the Globe
observes, come into use by way of decorations for
valentines, pincushions, and ladies' hats. To wit, the
skins of divers and sundry song and other little English
birds, namely, chaffinches, greenfinches, ordinary and
golden-crested wrens, hedge-sparrows, robing, yellow-
hammers, linnets, tomtits, and kingfishers; whereof the
last-named have been threatened with extermination,
owing to the demand for them by ladies' hatters. But
though these newly-fashionable and favourite garnitures
are certainly the tokens of a most hopeful rise in civili-
sation, that benefit is attended with this disadvantage,
that our beautiful small birds are in course of being im-
proved off the face of the earth. Therefore, it is to be
wished that our fair country women would vouchsafe,
whilst not ceasing to cultivate zoology with taste, to ex-
change the ornithological specimens now in vogue for
another sort, which, whilst involving no sensible loss,
would be equally becoming; as, for example, bats,
toads, frogs, lizards, efts, snails, moths, dragon-flies,
chafers, grasshoppers, crickets, cockroaches, and beetles.

E'en this poor pageant falls with such rebound
Into our stagnant lives of toil and gain,
The creaming mud-pool breaks in ripples round,
And all its whirl of mud-life seethes amain.
A Queen, and Prince, and Princess, and their Court,
And coaches, passing to St. Paul's to prayer;
To settle scores with Heaven, in stately sort:-
A Show for once! and our shows are so rare !

As empty or full purse the chance affords:

Streets for street-folk: the Church is still the Lords'.

And London's millions gaping while they kneel !

While her QUEEN passes, and, before the crowd,

Her Crown, and bows her knee, not elsewhere bowed.

Point to the sky, through London's whole extent:
Ey'n than the tall Memorial of her Fire.

How oft a Monarch with a pageant gay,
Or a Lord Mayor in glory doomed to last,
But to the next November's thrice third day!
And when, upon a visit of high State,

How many a City King hath, at thy Gate
Attended, to his Liege thy Keys to hand !

To crowds that gazed on Royalty below.
And now hast thon been whitewashed, Temple Bar,
But not as caitiffs plunged in hopeless debt;
Not as poor penniless insolvents are :
No, thou, though whitewashed, art not bankrupt yet!
And when some Hero, not perhaps unborn,
Is borne, through thee, to his Cathedral tomb,
A coat of blacking may thy face adorn:
But we rejoice; we will not discount gloom.
And are there those who fain would pull thee down-
Thou that maintain'st thy Westward crossing free?
Linked, as thou art, anew with England's Crown?
They shall not, Temple Bar. Perpetual be!
Happy the nation, that the wholesome leaven,
Temp'ring command, doth in obedience own;
And, while Earth's Sov'reigns are viceroys of Heaven,
Bows to the self-same power, on either throne.

To touch the hem of the dark veil that hides
The portals of the world beyond the tomb.
To touch that veil, yet come back to the light
Of mother's love; wife, babes, again to see ;
And learn the sorrow of the long-drawn night
By the glad morning's prayerful ecstasy.
Happy, to whom the lesson comes so soon,
How weak the barrier that parts life and death,
How small the time for toil 'twixt night and noon,
How ill life's work for playing can spare breath.
Moral Reflection.
“ONE half the world doesn't know how the other half lives."— Reflection.
Lucky for the Demi-Monde.
Happy all three-in spite of scoffing wit.

In one love, faith, allegiance, mutual knit-

Patriotism, that is, as defined in conversation by DR.
JOHNSON. The other night, a meeting of Patriots,
delegates to the number of 200 or so, from sixty political
and social organisations of Republicans and Revolu-

the White Horse Tavern, Castle Street, Oxford Street,
to arrange measures for opposing the Parks' Regulation
Bill, unanimously voted the following resolution:
“ That, considering the conduct of the Government, a de-
monstration to protest against the Parks' Regulation Bill be
held in Hyde Park on Sunday, the 3rd of March.”
These Patriots are particularly alarmed at a clause
of the Bill which they credit with virtually prohibiting
public meetings in the Parks. They will probably find
that they have been too nervous. In the meantime,
however, the PREMIER and Government are to be con-
gratulated on the menace of a demonstration to be held
in Hyde Park for the purpose of denouncing one of their
measures.

My own conversation, and the consequent cheerful-

the great satisfaction of feeling oneself comfortably

into by horses. I then understood the Scotch Calvinistic

observe that the police and soldiers behaved exceedingly
well, and were always ready to rescue some idiotie

he called BOTTOM's Dream, because it hath no bottom."- Midsummer
Night's Dream, Act iv., Sc. 1.
'Tis of Bully BOTTOM, a cobbler stout
As ever wax-end drew,
To patch a hole in a damaged sole,
Or set up a down-trod shoe.
Till from fair work to frothy talk
He fell, in evil day,
And to the “ Hole-in-the-Wall” must walk,
To hear the asses bray.
Then, "Why," thought he, "contented wait,
Botching at sole and heel,
With holes so great in Church and State
Such rents i' the common-weal ?
With a wax-end shall'he contend,
That in talk might wax high?
And upper-leathers only mend,
With upper classes by ?"
The more he talked the less he toiled,
And as the less he earned,
His blood 'gainst Capital it boiled,
Against employers burned :
Of stool and strap he would no more;
Away his awl he cast :
And by St. Crispin stoutly swore
Not to stick to his last.
And all the legs grew common sense,
The more grew self-conceit;
On weekly papers went his pence-
Their wind to him was meat:
And when of his own froth at last,
Report in them began,
He to the wind his apron cast,
And started Public Man!
Demonstrated : sent round the hat:
Raved in Trafalgar Square,
While still the British Lion sat,
And stared with quiet stare :
Talked fustian stuff, while rogue and rough
Shouted, and shoved, and stole;
And John BULL tame failed to inflame
With a red cap on a pole.
Till reason strayed, and BOTTOM brayed,
Yet deemed not sense had fled :
Nor knew, poor owl, his jobbernowl
Lad grown an ass's head!
So. to Fool's-Paradise a-whirled,
He dreamed a wondrous dream,
Wherein the world an asses' world,
And he its Lord, did seem.
Thre everything is upside down :
Highest to lowest drops :
Crowns serve but to be stood upon,
Pyramids rest on tops.
Rason is under Folly's feet,
Ignorance Knowledge schools;
Tae Cook is basted by the meat ;
Workmen ruled by their tools.
And in this topsy-turvy row
Sits Bully BOTTOM crowned;
Ab jut his ass's ears and brow
The bonnet-rouge y-bound.
And, asinine, from throats of brass,
The chorus rises free,

SAD FACT OF SOBRIETY.
A CORRESPONDENT of the Morning Post, under the
name of “SOBERSIDES," expresses his hope that “SIR
W. LAWSON, SIR R. ANSTRUTIER, &c., took the oppor-
tunity of seeing” that the statement of a certain clique
that their fellow-countrymen are drunken “was in-
applicable to the dense masses in the streets of London
on Tuesday night.” It is not to be expected that ocular
evidence of the sobriety of the multitude, even upon an
occasion of festivity, would have the slightest effect on
the minds or intentions of “SIR W. LAWSON, SIR R.
ANSTRUTHER, &c.," the "&c." including the REV.
DAWSON BURNS and the rest of the agitators for a Pro-
hibitory Permissive Democratic Despotic Liquor Law.

to the prevention of the drunkenness which they allege
to prevail amongst the people. It is not so much to
abate drunkenness that they want as to forbid drink-

renounced themselves. No doubt, in fact, both the * &c.”
and their leaders would, instead of being at all gratified,

of sobriety growing voluntarily amongst the people

Up, in the cloud-lands of High Church,
Down, in the mud-flats of Low,
Hark to your Chapel and my Church,
At it, with word and with blow !
Minister girding at Rector,
Rector on Minister down,-
A white-tied Achilles and Hector,
With National School for Troy-town. I
Through a longer than ten-year-long leaguer
That fortress the Church-Hector held,
And with orthodox lance, keen and eager,
The Chapel-Achilles repelled.
But Achilles found allies and backers,
Who seemed, for the time, of his mind;
Olympus was with the attackers,
And the scale against Hector inclined.
Awhile, those who'd backed up Achilles
Rejoiced to see Hector give ground:
“When he thrust from Pergamus Hill is,
Free way to 't," they thought, “ will be found.
Then, at last, thirsty souls may have entry,
To draw of those fountains so clear,
With no jealous clerical sentry,
To tax and toll all that come near.”
But scarce is the Church-Hector driven
From the gate he so struggled to hold,
Than Achilles, who so long has striven
To oust the Church Champion bold,
And stubborn, in front of the gate, there,
Where for entrance the thirsty ones pray,
He proclaims “ If I please, you shall wait there;
None shall pass, but by my will and way.
If Churchman once crowed o'er Dissenter,
Now 'tis turn of Dissenter to rule;
Not an urchin a free-school shall enter,
Unless 'tis a school of my school.
“If Hector once drove you like sheep on
The pathways to one Church that run,
Not less my road now you shall keep on-
The pathway that leadeth to none.
On these points there must be one mind, Sirs :
The point is, whose mind shall it be?'
Once you settled with him, but you 'll find, Sirs,
Henceforth you've to settle with me.
"My least finger, soon I will teach you,
More heavy than his loins doth weigh;
If the teeth of his whips once could reach you,
I have scorpions ready to flay.
You have yearned from Church-yoke to be free, Sirs,
On your necks that lay heavy as lead;
Now I'll give you a trial to see, Sirs,
How you like Chapel-yoke, in its stead.”

A FINE FOR A BEATING.
TIE Pall Mall Gazette says that :-
“In a case which came before the Magistrate
at Wandsworth, a greengrocer at Putney, named
GROVES, was fined £3 for assaulting his wife;
in default he was to go to prison for a month.
He asked his wife to pay the money, which she
did.”
So the wife was fined for the beating
which her husband had given her. What
a pity, one may think, it is that the pun-
ishment for beating a wife is not such as
necessarily to fall solely on the wife-
beater's shoulders. If the latter had sim-
ply to be flogged for his offence, the former
would not be liable to be fined.'

REASONS FOR GOING TO THE BOAT-RACE.
BECAUSE it is right to encourage all athletic exercises
which tend to produce manly vigour and calm self-
control.
Because it is right to take part in a scene in which all
classes of society can meet and mingle on common ground.
Because we wish to make ourselves better acquainted
with the beauties of our glorious River Thames.
Because we are anxious to see whether the manners
and habits of the lower orders are undergoing any
improvement.
Because we are desirous to form some estimate, from
personal observation, of the number of people present.
Because the village of Putney is dear to us, as having
been the birthplace of the author of The Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire.
Because we wish to compare the present style of row-
ing with what it was when we were at No Souls.
Because we take pleasure in watching the gradual
progress of spring vegetation in the country.
Because we have a relation from the cuuntry staying
with us who has never seen the Boat-Race.
Because it gives us the opportunity of meeting so many
old college friends.
Because the girls want to go.
Because we want a holiday.

BORN AT GENOA, 1806: DIED AT PISA, March 10, 1872.
But exile, poverty, and long farewell
To Genoa's blue sky and sunny sea
And sunny hearts, in northern cold to dwell,
Hated and hunted by the powers that be.
Slowly to gather strength but to be foiled;
To hurl young lives on desperate emprize,
Only to fail in tight, or, treason-coiled,
To waste in ling'ring count of prison sighs ;
To keep the sparks of hope and faith alight
In failing hearts, and not let fail his own:
To read “ ITALIA UNA" still writ bright,
Through mists of blood, and clouds of tempest blown;
To learn faith can turn false, and friendship cold;
To be called dreamer, Quixote, coward, fool:
Nay, lest such pillory-pelt friends' trust out-hold,
Branded as tyranny's decoy and tool:
“LET no man be called happy ere his death.”
So ran the wisdom of the antique world.
How shall we rate him who draws dying breath
On work unfinished, high hopes backward hurled ?
Such the first thought of most a thought that give
To one whose course has closed on weary days,
Where Pisa scarcely can be said to live,
And sleepy-seeming Arno seaward strays.
But not more shallow they that laugh to scorn
The thought that this slow stream to flood could leap,
That they that wasted deem this life outworn-
Not reckoning what men sow but what they reap.
Enough, that no Italian can doom
A life as poorly lived, or lived in vain,
Than which none ever better earned a tomb
Within the Holy Field * by Pisa's fane.
The greater still his right to such a grave,
That Death of honour owes him large arrear,
To whom Life, taking much, so little gave
In payment from the land he held most dear,
• The Campo Santo, the ancient and famous burial-place of Pisa, filled
with earth from Jerusalem, and decorated by the greatest painters and
sculptors of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
And-bitterer than the bitterest of these griefs-
At length to see hope to fruition grown,
And echo, chief among the nation's chiefs,
Italy's shout o'er Austria overthrown;
And standing high-crown'd in the Capitol,
Chief triumvir of a regenerate Rome,
To mark the glow of the old conquering soul
Come back from long trance 'neath St. Peter's dome;
And having thus topp'd highest reach of hope,
Suddenly to be hurled down to despair ;
To feel young right weak with old wrong to cope,
See alien arms Italian overbear;

Worse still the bearers of those arms to see-
Still red with blood of Rome's Republic slain- '
Hailed as the Saviours of Italy,
And crowned with honours Saviours scarce attain.
To see the Austrian yield each guarded hold,
And sadly, from across the salt sea-stream,
Watch Italy's rent robe, fold after fold,
Grow strangely to a garment without seam,
Yet raise no voice to bid the foe depart;
Yet lift no hand for the rent robe's repair:
With strangers' bitter bread to stay his heart;
Watch the work doing, nor be called to share;
Though feeling faith, soul, spirit still the same
As screened from quenching gust and choking air
The spark that now, grown to a lusty flame,
From Northern Alp to Southern Isle burns fair.
And when Italian ground once more he prest
With feet urged by home-sickness o'er the foam,
Italy had a gaoler for her guest,
Could find a prison for him-not a home!
Open at length his prison doors he found:
“Go forth; the score is cleared, even for thee."

And so MAZZINI is forgiven-is free.
O mockery of human lots and lives!

Nay, who can say what shocks such faith survives,
What strength such bitter tonies can impart?
None, e'en for this, saw wavering of his trust,
None, e'en for this, saw doubting of his way:
Stern only to himself, true, noble, just,
“God and the People !” still be made his stay.
To seal that pact, glorious, if less fulfilled
In their lives whom he trusted than his own,
His seed of faith, by fact's worst frost un-killed,
Though for no visible harvest, still was sown.

SEBASTOPOL was battered down-
Dance to the tune of £ s. d. !-
It cost a Czar his sceptre and crown,
And a half-million lives cost armies three.
Sebastopol was a threat, we were told-
Dance to the tune of £ s. d. !-
At Turkey flaunted by Bear so bold ;
And that John BULL wouldn't stand-not he!
So with JOHNNY CRAPAUD an alliance he made-
Dance to the tune of £ s. d. !--
And-a fig for outlay or stoppage of trade-
JOHN, JOHNNY, and Bear went a-clawing, all three !
John and JOHNNY so touzled the Bear-
Dance to the tune of £ s. d. !-
His poor old body was one big tear,
And out of his eyes he scarce could see.
Though, thanks to Old Bruin's teeth and claws-

We were forced to own that his hug and his jaws
Too strong and too sharp to be pleasing could be.

QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT.
THE practice of asking private Members questions connected with the position
they hold outside the House of Commons seeming to be well established, notice
has been given that the following interrogations will be addressed to Members
when the House re-assembles after the Easter recess :-
ALDERMAN SIR J. C. LAWRENCE will be asked as to the probable saving which
might be effected, if the Corporation of London were to substitute at all their
banquets (except that given on the ninth of November) mock turtle for real. |
LORD ELCHO will be asked, what is the average cost of the uniform of the
London Scottish, and whether any complaints have been made by recruits of the
inconvenience they suffer in severe weather through the insufficient protection
of their nether limbs.
COLONEL Hogg will be asked, whether there is any truth in the report that
the Metropolitan Board of Works intend to give a dinner to the Vestrymen, at
the Crystal Palace, on the Queen's Birthday, at the expense of the ratepayers.
MR. WALTER will be asked, what are the profits of the Times, and particularly
how much is annually derived from the Births, Marriages, and Deaths, and who
receives the proceeds.
MR. Bass will be asked, whether there is any secret ingredient or process in
the brewing of bitter beer.
SJR T. CHAMBERS will be asked for an estimate of the number of deceased
wives' sisters who intend to marry their deceased sisters' husbands, when the
Bill of which he had charge shall have passed the House of Lords.
MR. CARDWELL will be asked, what are the rites and ceremonies observed at
the initiation of a Druid.
MR. CHAPLIN, or MR. MERRY, will be asked to favour the House with some
private information as to the respective merits of the leading horses engaged
in this year's Derby.
MR. DISRAELI, as one of the Trustees of the British Museum, will be asked,
whether it is intended to resume the practice of supplying refreshments to
visitors to that great national institution.
SIR ARTHUR GUINNESS will be asked whether all the bottles labelled
John BULL may bluster, John BULL may blush-
Dance to the tune of £ 8. d.!-
But old Bruin for neither cares a rush,
For he knows John's not in the fighting key.
And JOHNNY CRAPAUD is down on his luck-
Dance to the tune of £ s. d.!-
And in want of pence, if not of pluck,
So Bruin from fear on that side 's free.
So John must see his work undone
Dance to the tune of £s. d. !-
And whistle, “0, where is my money gone?"
With the Russian forts flung into the sea !
And the Bear may laugh at the Lion's beard-
Dance to the tune of £ 8. d.!--
And flout John BULL, whom once he feared,
When life and money he risked more free.

Tuesday. This was the night of the great DILKE row. SIR
CHARLES DILKE was to move for an inquiry into the Civil List, and
the House and Galleries were crammed, a scene being expected.
For it had gone forth that the Republican Baronet was to be
smitten by no meaner hand than that of the First-Minister of the
Queen whose private affairs it was proposed to inquire into. Before
SIR CHARLES could begin, LORD BURY demanded of the SPEAKER
whether a profession of Republicanism were consistent with an oath
of allegiance. MR. BRAND did not consider it his business to decide
that question,
Noises began, and some of them were disagreeable. But the
Baronet was heard through his long speech fairly enough. He
brought out a great many details, and on the whole sought to show
that the Royal Income was not properly spent. Then did MR.
GLADSTONE arise in his righteous indignation, and went smashingly

A SUMMARY of DR. FRANKLAND's analytical examina-
tions of the somewhat different Fluids supplied by the
several Metropolitan Water Companies respectively to
the Metropolitan people contains a statement especially
interesting to the inhabitants of the districts, s. and
S.W.:-
“The Chelsea and Lambeth Companies draw their supplies
from the Thames after it bas received the polluted Mole and the
sewage of six hundred thousand people, including the filth of
Oxford, Reading, and Windsor."
The rest of the Water Companies' Fluids or Liquids
are described by DR. FRANKLAND as tarred, so to speak
as we are wont of solids, with the same brush as the
Chelsea and Lambeth, more or less, all but the Kent
Company, which " is the only one of the Metropolitan
Companies which draws its entire supply from chalk-
wells, and does not distribute any water from polluted
We know that:-
“Kent in the Commentaries Cæsar writ,
Is term'd the civill'st place of all this isle."
And, as regards water for drinking purposes, civilisa-
!tion in Kent is unaccompanied by the results of civilisa-
tion elsewhere, namely the admixture imparted to rivers
by tributaries from towns to which a name is given
| above. "Cometh up as a flower" is a saying applicable
to all the other Londoners than those supplied with the
Kent Company's water, since that on which the former
are reared is of a quality which renders it appropriate
for horticultural purposes. Of them, also, it is especially
true that all flesh is grass, since that which they drink
is about the same with what is better utilised in irriga-
tion. According to DR. FRANKLAND :-
“Living organisms were found in 1871 in most of the turbid
samples delivered by each of the Companies drawing their sup-
plies from the Thames, excepting only the West Middlesex,
which on all occasions sent out well-filtered water."

What makes a happy home? A good wife? A cheerful baby?
| An affectionate family? Ample means? Sound digestion ? No bills ?
Excellent servants? These are all old-fashioned notions, not worth a
moment's consideration, when compared with the grand discovery
of the enthusiastic philanthropist who instructs us that there can
be “No happy home without its Easter egg.". Perhaps he is right.
The most amazing pun which even Mr. Punch ever read was made
on the subject of eggs, and is attributed to Dean SWIFT. Macedonia's
Madman, "PHILIP's warlike son,” disliked the article so much that
when he came into a room where his friends were eating "demnition
eggs," there was a cry, “All eggs under the grate.” “Yes, it is

this anecdote and an Easter egg together will not make a British
home happy, “our brains are addle."

THE East wind blows cold, and Jack Frost lays his hold
On noses and fingers and toes,
In dull leaden grey scowls the sky all
And at last weeps its sulks out in snows.
And the pretty pink blossoms of almond and peach,
And the apricot's petals so pale,
Of cruel Jack Frost vainly mercy beseech,
Or of crueller Easterly gale!
And they piteously cry with a shudder and sigh,
As they shrivel and shrink on the wall,
“ Poor fools to be lured by a blink of blue sky,
But to flush, and to fade, and to fall !"
And though tongher my mettle than peach-blossom's petal,
This cold makes e'en my temper hot :
Was it KINGSLEY wrote drivel to East winds too civil?
May East winds in his teeth blow his rot!
One thinks with a shiver of lads on the river,
As it rolls, cold and lumpy and rough;
And mad as March hares the crew reckon that dares
In such weather to strip to the buff!
And scarcely less frantic the public, old antic !
For Oxford or Cambridge entété,
That, in spite of this weather, a million together,
Crowds bridge and shore, tow-path, and jetty!
Side by side, rival blues, unlike roses of hues
Lancastrian and Yorkist of old,
In the same field displayed-dark, in noses half flayed,
And light in fair cheeks pinched with cold !

DOMESTIC ECONOMY.
THE eyes of provident young bachelors may with profit
be directed to this elegant description of some articles
of toilette, which they will doubtless be expected, if they
marry, to provide :-
“ The coiffure consisted of a LOUIS THE FIFTEENTH puff,
composed of blue feathers, Alençon lace, and a bouquet of
flowers; while LOUIS THE FIFTEENTH shoes of blue faille, with
rose-coloured heels, trimmed with lace, blue bows, and a rose-
coloured puff, completed the toilette."
Ex pede Venerem. One may judge of the extrava-
gance of all the rest of the costume of this Venus of
the period, merely from the costly decoration of her
feet. Shoes trimmed with lace, and beautified with
blue bows and adorned with roseate heels, would be
sadly out of keeping with a simple muslin dress. So
we are told that lace and feathers were worn upon the
head, to match the lace and ribbons that were layished
on the feet, and we further are informed that -
But no: in mercy we forbear to finish the account.
What costly furbelows and flounces, what prodigious
puffs and paniers, what amazing silks and satins, and
what innumerable flowers, feathers, fringes, filagree,
and flummery, were further spent in the adornment of
this fashionable Venus, we leave to timid bachelors in
their innocence to guess. Wary husbands will not thank
us for further revelation of the wonders of the fashion

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ECCLESIASTICAL ATTITUDE.
A CAPITAL subject for a Pre-Raphaelite picture, or a
memorial-window in a "pro-cathedral," is suggested
by a telegram from Berlin, which follows:-
“The German Catholic Bishops will assemble in April to con-
cert a common attitude towards the Government."
It is well known that the German Catholic Bishops
have nearly all of them accepted the Dogma of Papal
Infallibility; and, in so doing, many of them eaten
their own words. It is also known, to some perhaps by
whom it is denied, that the Dogma of Papal Infallibility
is a pretence first put forward in the Middle Ages.
Furthermore it is evident that the attitude which those
Bishops will assume towards the Government will, what-
soever one they adopt, be an attitude which will have
been determined by the promulgation of that Dogma.
The attitude, therefore, of the German Catholic Bishops,
pictorially represented, should correspond to the
mediævalism which it will signify, and be very stiff and
angular; the Bishops being delineated all more or less
wry-necked, standing on tip-toes, and holding their
crookst between the palms of their open hands, as Mr.
Punch, in his street drama, wields his cudgel. Thus
they will be portrayed in a mediæval attitude of menace
towards their Government, intended to frighten it.

THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN.
“WOMEN'S DISABILITIES REMOVAL BILL. – MR. JACOB
BRIGHT's Bill proposes to enact that in all Acts relating to the

Frederick Denison Maurice.
BORN 1804. DIED 1872.
Nor Bishopric, nor Deanery, nor Stall
Of Canon or of Prebend, empty stands,
By reason of this death, whose tidings fall
To sadden many hearts in many lands;
Yet to uplift e'en whom they sadden most;
The steady star, whose dimming here we mourn,
Beams ever for us in the heavenly host,
And only there seems to have reached its bourne.
The broad bright light, whose guiding radiance shone
So wide on earth, shines broader, brighter now :
What though the true voice, and sweet smile be gone,
Closed the kind eyes beneath the steadfast brow-
The life of love he lived, the truth he spoke,
The seeds of good he sowed on earth remain :
In many brave hearts, eased from Evil's yoke,
The fruitful soul of MAURICE lives again.
Stout runners, over duty's dusty course,
Will carry on the torch his hand lets fall;
Whose flame, he bearing it, nor craft nor force
Quenched, or made quiver-a sure light for all!
If e'er man's life showed Christian faith and love,
If ever man's lips Christian doctrine spoke,
That life was lived by him while here he strove,
That trumpet-truth from his tongue souls awoke,
Which slept, and would have slept, while, like a fall
Of lulling waters, orthodoxy ground
Its barrel-organ, and the poppied pall
Of seventh-day slumber shed its influence round.
A dangerous spirit, by decorum's gauge,
Who on Heaven's road shook turnpikes and scorned tolls,
Could fling forth words white-hot with noble rage,
As well as lit with love, compelling souls.
Armed with his well-proved thought he faced abuse,
Loss, conflict, obloquy, believing still
That God, who gives us reason, wills its use.
That reverent trust in right can work no ill.
He ne'er met lie but off its mask to tear,
Nor e'er encountered truth but to embrace :
Heedless what seemly vizard lie might wear,
Or what thick veil might hide truth's noble face.
Why pause the lot of such a life to read-
Its band of high, and humble, grateful friends,
Of honours, wealth, its small share, smaller need:
How can he miss, who seeks not, worldly ends ?
He being dead yet speaks, and still will speak
More widely, as men grow more brave and wise,
In wider sympathy, and faith less weak,
And interchange of larger charities.
Crowned with a radiant crown, than earth's more fair,
'Mid love and reverence he leaves life below,
To seek the life above, and welcome there,
Face to face, all 'twas his, e'en here, to know !
Satisfactory Vote, nevertheless.

This hint MR. BARLOW received in such good part, and, indeed,
made so ingenious a reply, as to obtain for him another sprightly
tap from MRS. BLOBBSOMER'S fan.
After dinner the usual loyal toasts were proposed by the oldest
member of the company, and responded to by MASTER TOMMY, and
also by MR. BARLOW, who, in acknowledging the health of His Royal
Highness the PRINCE OF WALES, wound up a singularly eloquent
speech with these words :-“Yes, my friends, the news of the
Prince's recovery has been hailed with delight (Great applause)

noes of Africa (Sobs, and cries of Hear, hear!!), and the Uninhabited
Islands of the Great Pacific." (Immense cheering.)
At this point the excitement of the company became almost un-
controllable, and it was not, indeed, until the ladies had assembled
in the drawing-room, leaving the gentlemen to the enjoyment of
their wine, that anything like calm was restored. MRS. BLOBB-
SOMER, the mother of MATILDA, and MRS. PEJINKLE, the mother of
SOPHONISBA (who during dinner had been seated at MASTER TOMMY'S

of the new arrivals at the Abbey Boarding-House.

(Respectfully dedicated by Mr. Punch to MR. JUSTICE Easby.)
I WALLOPED my old 'ooman like a sack;
I broke three cart-whips across her back;
I kicked her for trying to git away;
I shoved her under a brewer's dray;
But it's well beknown them cats o' wives

But the area-railings went and kitched her ;
Still she bled like a pig, and spoiled her bonnet,

And 'acos the old 'ooman couldn't speak,

As how, if the railins had not been blunt,

Which, in point o' fact they broke her fall.

THE House of Commons acted with even more than its usual
wisdom in negativing the address, moved by SIR WILFRID LAWSON,
for taking steps for withdrawing from all treaties binding this
country to interfere by force of arms in the affairs of other nations.
There is no occasion for England to profess cessation of existence as
a European Power. We may now and then be in a position enabling
us to enforce a treaty very much to our advantage. Nemo
tenetur ad impossibile. We are not bound to interfere when we are
unable, and whenever, as in the case of the Russian Circular last
year, there is inconvenience, or hazard, in the vindication of a
broken treaty by force of arms, why, we can always sneak out of it.

That they, who Little Pedlington o'er-crow,

Than, ere cheeseparing hand controlled the helm,
The worst and weakest rulers of the Realm !
These goods, most practical of races known,
JOHN BULL can call, in Europe's face, his own.
And to his bosom hug, in calm content,
The rank-ripe fruits of sweet Self-government.
Only one thought his exultation bates,
The thought how much the harvest costs in rates;
One doubt-as still 'tis JOHN BULL's prudent way
His blessings in his balances to weigh-
Whether, when Humbug's hushed, and Bunkum still,
'Tis worth all this cost to be ruled so ill!
FALLACY OF FIGURES.
A PARAGRAPH of frequent occurrence in contemporary news, headed
“Extraordinary Longevity," reveals ever and anon an instance of
the duration of human existence, equal to or exceeding the age of
METHUSELAH. This sum of years, however, is an addition sum ;
not simply the sum total of a column of units representing an indi-
vidual life, but the sum of three, four, or more totals of so many
columns which represent the lives of so many individuals met
together. As the age of METHUSELAH would be equalled by the
united ages of 969 infants, of one year old, collected at a baby-show,
the profundity of this arithmetic is evident. The same calculus
could be applied to other things than longevity as instructively as it
is to that. A daily paper, the other day, contains a case in point,
whence it might be argued, by an imposing array of figures, that
pains for the prevention of dastardly outrages are not spared certain
ruffians who deserve them :-
"FLOGGING GAROTTERS.--Ten garotters, who were sentenced at the recent
assizes in Leeds, received their flogging yesterday afternoon at Armley Gaol,
each having twenty lashes."
Their united floggings amounted to two hundred lashes. But
what are two hundred lashes among ten scoundrels ?
The Two Cases.
SAYS JOHN LEMOINNE, “ The English Counter-case
Has strength writ on its plain, straightforward face."
“That's nat'ral” (says Sam, with some impatience)
“Strong counter-cases suit shop-keeping nations.
But how about my case? Guess that will funk em?”-
Not while John BULL can weigh bounce and smell bunkum!

(Song, by MR. HAWFINCH, on a late Vicissitude of the
Weather.)
A PURTY sight it wuz to view
The yaller primroses appear,
Likewise the vi'luts, white and blue,
So early as they did this year.
Daisy and shiny buttercup
'Twuz pleasant peepun' to behold,
And dandelions blazun up
Wi' leaves bright green and vlowers o' gold.

To show how forrard all things be,
Swallers, this April, dree or four,
A vartnight earlier I zee
Nor ever get I sin afore.
And just about when they appeared,
A-chevy'n hinsex on the wing,
The cuckoo one fine day I heerd,
And nightingale the night droo sing.
The pigs his tuneful notes mistook, ,
And woke, some on 'um, up vrom bed,
'Cause why they vancied “Chook, chook, chook,"
Was callun' of 'um to be fed.
Their disappointmunt, for to squake,
And grant, the hogs in concert made.
How 'tis, thinks I, to lie awake
And hark to Natur's serrynade!

From West and South the wind chopped back.
And then the feathery quire, at least,
Fell dumb as mutes in funeral black.
For then come sleet, and then come hail,

And nare a slag, nor nit a snail,

And so did t'other birds, no doubt:

The Creed of St. Athanasius may be so named, subject to the remark
that it is not a Creed (having no credo), that Athanasius was not a

Mayhew has been unexpectedly called away. Associated with this periodical from nearly its

rendered him independent of labour, he continued to share our counsels, and he never abated his
earnest interest in our work. This testimonial is easy. But when we would speak of the manly
simplicity and childlike affection of his nature, of his indomitable cheerfulness, of his ready
generosity, and of his singular sweetness of temper, we can write only what must seem to those who
knew him not, in excess of the truth, while it fails to do justice to our own knowledge of a beloved
friend. But in the affectionate memories of us all his worth and lovingness will be treasured while

“On Friday night a meeting of Domestic Servants resident in Dundee and
neighbourhood was held. Two girls addressed the meeting at some length,
contending that Domestic Servants were entitled to a half holiday weekly and
a free Sabbath every fortnight, or a full holiday once a fortnight. Hours
should be from six to ten, and no labour on Sunday except what was abso-
lutely necessary. A long and animated discussion afterwards took place as to
the restrictions which were placed upon the wearing apparel of the Servants.
If they were compelled to wear what was generally known as a 'flag,' it
should be at the expense of the Mistress. The opinion was, however, that it
ought not to be worn at all. Mistresses had no right to interfere with Ser-
vants' apparel in any way so long as it was paid for. What right had Mis-
tresses to pry into the character of their servants? It was high time that
the Domestic Servants should form themselves into an organisation, whereby
they would be enabled to secure information as to the characters, temper, and
conduct of those who might become their employers. It was agrees to form
an Association."-Dundee Advertiser, April 20.
“SERVANTS' GRIEVANCES.— A crowded meeting of Gentlemen's Servants
was held last night at the Temperance Hall, Leamington, to discuss their
grievances. MR. Sollis, butler at Leamington College, presided, but the
great mass of the meeting consisted apparently of coachmen, gardeners, and
stablemen. The Chairman as:erted that the condition of many Gentlemen's
Servants was worse than that of slaves, complained of the long hours butlers,
gardeners, and others had to work for the wages they received, and advocated
shorter hours and increased pay. A Resolution was unanimously adopted for
the formation of a Union of butlers, gardeners, grooms, footmen, and porters.
Cheers were given for the Maids of Dundee,' and at the conclusion of the
meeting a number of members were enrolled.”—Leamington Courier, April 25.
To the Leamington flankeys 'twas SOLLIs that spoke :
“The Warwickshire labourers' strike is a joke
To what when we strike the sensation will be-
Come follow the housemaids of Bonny Dundee !
“ Come, from buttons to butler, from tiger to groom;
Come, gard'ner from greenhouse, and coachman from brougham;
Come open your grievances, open them free,
And follow the flag' of the Maids of Dundee."
Stop SOLLIS who can, now he's once on his feet,
Though Leamington's dowagers plaintive may bleat,
Though her bilious old Indians more bilious may be,
When Leamington follows the lead of Dundee.
" Come, from buttons to butler,” &o.
As Sollis the wrongs of the liveried made known,
Some thought of the trumpets at Jericho blown,
And those lights hid in pitchers seemed butlers to be,
Ere they followed the housemaids of Bonny Dundee !
“Come, from buttons to butler,” &c.
“What, though with three meat-meals a-day we are crammed,
Till in laced coats and plush fellers' figures feel jammed ;
Though with beer, and e'en wines, Servants' 'Alls may flow free,
Why should men not strike here, if maids strike in Dundee ?
“Come, from buttons to butler,” &c.
Even hedgers and ditchers can strike, so one hears,
And if they're Labour's Commoners, we are her Peers;
Who should know on which side our bread's buttered but we? -
Though for grievances Leamington mayn't be Dundee !
“ Come, from buttons to butler,” &c.
“ Let Masters complain we're 'fed better than taught;'
There's an answer to that, which it is 'So we ought!'
Why if Servants' 'All fare, like its schoolin' should be,
'Twouldn't breed pluck to follow the Maids of Dundee !
“Come, from buttons to butler," &c.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL

MAGEE BEFORE MANNING.
Two Bishops, by different tailors arrayed,
One known to the law, and the other POPR-made,
Both anxious to make men from guzzle abstain,
By different methods their object would gain.
Says MANNING—"That drink's such a terrible thing,
Such ruin and wreck on its victims does bring,
I claim that a certain majority's vote
Shut doors interpose may 'twixt tipple and throat.
An evil it is, humankind to infest,
Too gross to be suffered ; it must be repressed.
Of liquor-to stem lush if other means fail-
I say, let a Maine Law prohibit the sale."
Our Bishop would men from excess have desist
Induced by such means as with virtue consist.
“ Free England and sober I wish,” says MAGEE,
“But if free or sober, why then England-Free.”
The titular Prelate speaks such prelates' mind;
For they to their aprons would pin all mankind :
Would subject the world, if they could, to priest-rule,
And grown-up folk govern as children at school.
The Prelate we own, with a far other ken,
Discerns that men need to be governed as men;
That poor slaves of Vice will be slaves of Vice still,
For all check imposed on the acts of their will.
Were Englishmen sober like slaves, from their swipes,
Unwilling, restrained but by terror of stripes,
Might evil not then find a vent in worse works
Than even the sots'—were they sober as Turks ?
No, pedants and priests, Britons drink may eschew,
By choice, but not schooled like your kiss-my-rod crew.
No rod for them save what, with masterly touch,
Punch lays on the fellows who liquor too much.

EPISTOLARY GEM.
MR. PUNCH has just seen, in the Era, a letter so charming that
he must extract a-nay, as the fair writer would probably say, must
cull a rose-leaf from the perfumed treasury. An English lady
named MARKHAM (as to her Christian name we are uncertain, as the
Era calls her “ LYDIA” and the letter is signed “PAULINE," but
both names are delightful) is performing in America. Miss MARK-
HAM desires to thank the American Press for its kindness. There
has been an exception, it seems, but that may pass. Hear the rest of
the Pauline epistle :
“I have been sufficiently abused by private individuals through malice,
because possibly I did not smile upon them or receive them as friends. I am
but human, a free, good-hearted, frank woman. To the public what could I
say? Could I, upon my bended knees, show to the American people how
grateful I am to them for the support and encouragement I have received at
their hands, for their indulgent kindness to me when I have been ill, and
their hearty applauso, which has ever greeted my efforts to please them, I
would gladly bend to them daily. I love America dearly, for during my
sojourn here I have never known an American gentleman to insult the name
of or abuse a woman. Concerning my professional abilities, I will leave the
public to judge of them. Myself and confrères are. nightly or daily, ag we
may happen to appear, drawing full houses, and I never seem to miss an
encore. The bouquets that I receive are beautiful, and I ever take them to
my happy home, where the air is 'musical with birds.' I never felt more
competent to please, nor more healthy than at present. So please tender my
thanks to the entire Press, save the Philadelphia paper, and assure them I
hope they may continue as well in health, as happy and contented in mind,
as theirs, gratefully,
“PAULINA MARKHAM."
We think this letter 80 nice. But we extract from it chiefly
because just now we wish the Americans to be exceedingly well
pleased with us, and we consider the above epistle calculated to do
the utmost good, and to remove any little irritation on the subject of
the Alabama Claims. So thanks to Miss LYDIA or PAULINE MARK-
HAM.

IMAY
But luckily I was there to defy
The drawbacks to sea-walling :
Let ocean swallow ! my purse could supply
Hiatuses ne'er so appalling :
The louder Nep bade me eat humble pie,
The more I defied his squalling.
So I flung a million into the deep-
I would have flung two millions-
Before my mile of sea-wall 'gan peep
From Ocean's green pavilions,
To amaze, by the breadth and strength of its steep,
Tars, soldiers, and civilians.
'Tis true it cost awful sums to repair,
And a fleet it wouldn't shelter,
If the wind from the South-East quarter should bear,
The sea would come in a pelter !
And the guns of to-day, from its forts, I'm aware,
Would drive the men helter-skelter.
But if we couldn't hold it'gainst JOHNNY CRAPAUD,
He, 'gainst us, couldn't hold it, either :
My breakwater ne'er would screen the foe,
And at worst, would be useful to neither!
If a million and a half must go,
That it goes so makes one blither!
And now this remarkable work 's achieved,
We come to the practical question,
As no good from it is, or can be, received,
_Which useless expense I'd best shun-
That of keeping up what I've thus upheaved,
Or of dishing, for Nep's digestion.
'Twill cost many thousands to keep in repair,
But 'twill cost still more for destroying :
That's something like work-no scamping there-
I know whom I'm employing.
If one pays through the nose, it is but fair,
Of good work to have the enjoying !
With Neptune I've fought for the Channel-sea,
Which I rule, though he swears he's still king :
I don't like my Alderney milking me,
'Stead of me my Alderney milking :
But with sea-wall and forts to let Nep make free,
Seems the islanders like bilking.
So now, with the wise of my Commons' House
The problem I am weighing-
Giv'n, millions in the sea flung-souse !-
How the drain on my purse to be staying;
To kick down this trophy of practical nous —
Or to keep it up go on paying!
There, you unpractical Teutons and Celts,
Is the Anglo-Saxon's lesson !
Not for camps and forts his gold he melts,
Content with war's work to mess on:
If you'd make ends meet, take up your belts,
Ånd his lines carefully dress on!

My name is JOHN BULL, I'm a practical man,
So come, ye unpractical nations,
And learn how to follow my lead, if you can,
In making your calculations,
And be guided by me, when you lay down a plan,
By practical considerations !
Above all, when your taxpayers' cash you spend,
Let use be expenditure's measure :
In applying your means keep in view the end,
Nor make ducks and drakes of your treasure:
'Ware work which takes less to make than mend,
And can't be unmade at pleasure.
As a practical instance best illustrates rules,
If you'd test the above by my own work,
You will find the best of all possible schools
In my Alderney-harbour stonework;.
Its lessons if you can't read, you are fools,
Who don't deserve to be shown work.
Lest France on that isle in a war should lay hand-
Though how, if she did, she could hold it,
Is a thing no féllow can understand-
With forts I resolved to enfold it,
And into a station for Channel-command,
By a breakwater to mould it.
With something like a mile of sea-wall
To build out the Atlantic,
In twenty fathom, is no joke at all-
It drove the contractors frantic-
Six years' work going in six hours' squall,
To smithereens gigantic !

Penal servitude during life was awarded to WILLIAM
ROUPELL in punishment of an offence which he had
confessed and made every reparation for in his power.
But it was the offence of forging a will. If he had

was stated that in other ballots the cross is seldom used by the voter,
who prefers a tick, or a straight line. It has also come out that at

If Romanesque Parsons became Roman true,

Now, playing at Papists, those Anglicans high
O'er laymen can priest it, and Bishops defy.
They'd find for such one-sided humbug no scope,
To Bishops subordinate under the POPE.

TERRIBLE TEMPTATION.
In a certain Bill now under the consideration of a Select Com-
mittee, there is a clause which makes us wonder how it could ever
have entered into the head of the honourable and learned gentle-
man by whom the measure including it was prepared. That Bill is
the Juries' Bill; its author is the ATTORNEY-GENERAL: and the
clause, which it appears almost incredible that anyone endowed
with the moral sensibility of SIR JOHN COLERIDGE could have con-
ceived, provides that “persons convicted of felony shall be no longer
qualified to serve on juries.” Considering the loss of time and
money, in such a case as CASTRO's action for instance, to which
jurors are liable, and considering, further, that in other cases they
are often subjected to the disgusting punishment of being locked up
together all night, it is really astonishing that it never struck the
ATTORNEY-GENERAL that exemption from the possibility of being
saddled with the office of juror, obtained by getting convicted of a
felony, would operate on many people in danger of being compelled
to serve on juries, as a very powerful incentive to commit a little
one.

As regards Almoner I do not speak so decidedly, because he certainly complies
with the definition of a horse, being a large quadruped, with a leg at each
corner of him, but those who have legs all right, may yet misplace alms. He
ought to do something, and I believe will. Drummond is not a horse to be
sneezed at; in fact, I do not know that any horses are made for that purpose.
MR. HENRY DRUMMOND, a remarkable man, used to keep a horse always
saddled and bridled in his stable, to be ready for the end of the world, and
if this is that animal, back him, for MR. DRUMMOND had the best of every-
thing, and usually, in debate, the best of everybody. We visited Queen's
Messenger, and GRUMPY made a stupid quotation about a “poster of the sea
and land," à propos of seeing a poster of Land and Water. As for Q. M., I
consider that he ought to win, because I have drawn him in a Sweep. Angel
means Messenger, and if he wins I will call him an angel-I can't say fairer.
He is a clinking good horse, a fact which would comfort me more if I knew
what clinking meant. However, let the cannakin olink, and let the cannakin
clink, a king's but a man, and a pot's not a pan, and so we'll have something
to drink. We have now to speak of Cremorne, or as ten thousand cads will
call him, on the day, Cree-morne. All snobs are in a hurry with their
accents. The noble lady who owns the name is descended from MR. WHALEY,
and if the horse goes, as the beautiful Scotch song says, Whaley, whaley up
the bank, and whaley whaloy down the brae, why his backers may blubber.
On the other hand, if he is only half as fast as Cremorne-haunters fancy
they are, the Blue Riband is his. Do I express myself clearly? If you
think not, read what I have said over again until you are tired,
then stop. Finally, we come to the Favourite, bonny Prince Charlie.
The prince of that pame was a pretender. This horse is very big. We have
lately seen a big pretender come to grief. But Prince Charlie has real good
blood in him, and Epsom may not be his Culloden, or his Court of Common
Pleas. His motto, however, mustn't be “On-Slow.” This was GRUMPY'S

THE OLD STORY.
(At the Horse Show.)
INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITIONS.
We have been requested to publish the
following programme of the various classes
of objects, intended to be shown at the
annual International Exhibitions during
the remainder of the period which com-
menced in 1871, and will terminate in
1880. As many of the articles enumerated
below require much time for their careful
and complete preparation, and will have
to be transported from distant countries,
it is obvious that it must be an immense
advantage to intending exhibitors to know
beforehand the precise year when their
specialities will be submitted to public in-
spection and cosmopolitan competition at
South Kensington :
1873.--Skates, slides for magic lanterns,
&c., turtle in tanks; millinery, mathe-
matical instruments, perambulators, walk-
ing-sticks, and aërated waters.
1874.- Menageries, mangles, baths and
washhouses, games and sports, stove orna-
ments, hats, and draining tiles.
1875.-Postage stamps, silkworms, arti-
ficial limbs, small arms, omnibuses, light-
ning conductors, shows, spectacles, and
other optical instruments.
1876.–Flags, asphalt and other pave-
ments, yachts, medicine chests, hothouses,
waxwork, refrigerators, liveries and li-
queurs.
* 1877.-Matches, wedding outfits, saddles
and bridles, church-bells, confectionery
(including bridecakes), lighthouses, gaso-
meters, and perfumery.
1878.- Agricultural implements, sewing
machines, swimming apparatus, diving-
bells, dry docks, dentistry, and gums.
1879. - Panoramas, patent medicines,
parasols and umbrellas, circuses, chand-
lery, autographs, and bathing-machines.
1880.–Pipes and preparations of tobacco,
apparatus for preventing and consuming
smoke, observatories, orangeries, artificial
flowers, acts of parliament, carriages-and-
four, balloons, flying machines, fireworks,
and anything that may have been omitted
in previous years.
Fine arts, fine dresses, flirtations, re-
freshments, season tickets, turnstiles, cata-
logues, military bands, crowds of people,
and grumblers every year.

mined to sit on Ascension Day, adjourned

said that the majority of the representa-
tives of the people of this great country
are Secularists. They have, at any rate,
a cultus of their own, and it is something
other than the idolatry of the Golden

ILLIUENA
OVER A DEAD TREATY.
ENOUGH Misunderstandings,
Of Understandings grown:
And Oliver-Twist demandings
By Bunkum-bellows blown :
We've tried conciliation,
Of concession not fought shy,
Bowed to all humiliation,
Short of downright humble pie.
Yielding never favour curried,
Or carried it would be :
If the Treaty's dead and buried-
Amen to it-say we!
If e'er JOHN BULL was willing
Nice points of right to waive :
Take tenpence in the shilling,
Nor the missing coppers crave :
If e'er at Yankee 'cuteness
He was content to wink,
On our cousins'-hem !-astuteness,
His sentiments to blink,
'Twas to save this wretched kettle
Of Fish from boiling o'er,
Claims, howe'er unjust, to settle,
Heal each self-fretted sore.
For this we shirked plain-speaking,
Lest their mob it might inflame:
Of party-chiefs' self-seeking,
Were content to help the game:
Put faith in their assurance,
Whom assurance ne'er controlled,
And bond of hardest durance
Was none too strong to hold ;
And when they turned the tables,
And tripped us in the dust,
Found cobwebs and not cables
In the ties that were our trust.
Did we listen when they hinted
That" claims are only claims,
Of Brummagem brass-minted,
Counters for party-games ?”
That, “after all, what matter
How much a case may ask ?
To sift the lawyers' chatter,
Will be the judge's task:
Why grudge a bit of Bunkum
Mob and mob-press to lime?
Wire-pullers have to funk 'em
So near election-time!”
Best, p'raps, such pryings smother,
And leave question on the shelf,
Which side has done the other,
And which has done itself.
We've given our cousins due rope;
- In a tangle if they've got,
The record,'s there, for Europe
To say who made the knot.
We've bungled it betwixt us-
Decide, you who've the phlegm,
Is 't our cousins that have fixed us,
Or we that have fixed them?
Meantime the Treaty's done for ;
And all 's well well that ends:
Till the White House is run for,
Parties must please their friends.
That fixed in happier season
FISH may resume the floor,
And to quiet row by reason
Invite John BULL once more.
Till then, sans fame or frothing,
Our terms will stand the same :
For Indirect Claims-NOTHING :
For Direct ones, HALF YOUR CLAIM,



EXPERIENTIA DOCET.
“O DEAR ME! HAS TITTENS DOT PINS IN THEIR TOES, I VUNDER !”
ABILITIES AND ENJOYMENT.
THE Income-tax for ever! That is what you are in for. Ye who pay it
abandon all hope. No substitute is possible for it, here at least in England
-although they manage these matters otherwise in France. Before all things
it is necessary that the Masses should drink cheap tea-that settles the question.
Make up your minds, therefore, to endure everlasting confiscation. You cannot
help yourselves. But you need not allow yourselves to be deprived not only
of your money, but also of the solace you derive from grumbling under the
conviction that you are wronged. The Times, in a leader the other day,
advanced the following apology for the impost from which you must never
expect to be free :-
"The authority of ADAM SMITH is probably the highest on this subject among political
economists, and it will be hard to show that an Income-tax sins in principle against any
but one of his famous maxims. It purports at least to excel all indirect taxes in strict
compliance with the first and most important of those maxime, since it is specially
designed to make all subjects contribute to the support of the Government in proportion
to their respective abilities—that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively
enjoy under the protection of the State."
Suppose that, of two men, one enjoys, under the protection of the State, £500
a year of revenue derived from fixed property, and the other enjoys the same
amount of revenue derived from the practice of medicine, or otherwise obtained
by personal exertions, and liable and likely to fail him at any moment. Are
their respective enjoyments the same? Are their respective abilities the same?
Is one as able as the other to enjoy himself? Is he as able to keep a carriage
or to marry a wife? If there is no comparison between their respective abilities
to incur expense, how much is there between their respective abilities to stand
taxation ? No; you are plundered, victims of Schedule D. There may be no
redress for you, but you are plundered. Grin and-bear it.
A Painful Impression.

Row, Cousins, row, but not too fast-
Long, strong, and steady's the stroke to last !
Columbia's clustered stars wax dim,
As his Pæan at Putney JOHN BULL doth bymn!
But'tis English blood flows in Yankee veins :
One sire is at bottom of both our strains :
To beat such a crew is enough of praise :
To be so beaten no blush need raise.
But ere from the river we homeward turn
We've our lessons both from the match to learn.
Atalantas must form and style o'erhaul,
If to Britishers they'd not still sing small.
And our crew have proved, beyond a doubt,
That a coxswain is weight to be done without:
That there's profit in ČLASPER's sliding shelves ;
That they need no steersman who steer themselves :
But there's wider lesson for both to note
Than ends, if it starts, in a racing-boat.
You, American Cousins, may learn to-day
There's a kind of work that makes little way.
Arms may be active, and oars be swayed
With a clock-work swing of back and blade,
But unless each man his weight can pull,
'Tis U P with JONATHAN 'gainst JOHN BULL.
Small good in arms, howe'er fast they go,
Unless there are stalwart legs below:
The show of work is what people see,
But the pith of the pull's in the point d'appui.
In Boat-race or diplomatic game
The principle is still the same :
'Tis not forcing of pace, nor flow of say,
But what you've to stand on that wins the day.
And you, the crew that the credit sustain
Of that tried old "ship,” the Great Britayne,
Mind you don't trust too much in “ slide,"
And for want of a coxswain go yawing wide.
The sliding seat was a happy thought;
But the slide must come when and where it ought:
Move forward when back you weight should throw,
Or back when forward, to grief you go!
I think in a recent treaty race
Shortcomings in either crew I trace.
My cousins, for all the fuss they made,
A decided want of legs betrayed.
So I found when through their case I'd gone ;
The deuce a leg had they to stand upon.
And while that's so, you may sweat yourselves blind,
But, take my word, you 'll be left behind.
And JOHN BULL's crew, BILL GLADSTONE stroke,
Have shown want, more than once, of the coxswain's yoke :
And their steering, with only the stroke for guide,
Has been, now and then, decidedly wide.
And this new-fashioned "sliding," - although I'm told,
It gives longer reach, and better hold, -
Has tended, I fear, but I hope I'm wrong,
To make course less steady and stroke less strong!

suppose, instead of a house decorated by MR. OWEN JONES, and a set

founding schools and scholarships, for instance, and in educating
their poor relations' children, and sending them to the Universities;
even suppose they expended it in almshouses, and Peabodying the
destitute, the mechanical working-classes would have far less cause
to be satisfied with them than they are now. It may be that there
is a wiser and a better use for riches than lavish expenditure on the
productions of market-gardening and decorative art; but the con-
sumption, at any rate, benefits producers, and enables employers in
those lines of business to pay the artisans and labourers the higher

OUR ANGELA writes to the papers
On behalf of her small feathered friends,
Whose song helps to drive away vapours,
Where with blue sky the London-smoke blends.
As with all that is weak and ill-treated,
With the birds she is quick to condole :
The iron so cruelly heated
To blind them has entered her soul.
She mourns o'er their nests rudely harried
By the school-boy's irreverent hand;
O'er their young, into slavery carried
By the bird-catcher's buccaneer band.
From the gutter-bred Sparrows-poor slaveys,
Only good to be shot out of traps,
To the Larks, doomed to roast in their gravies,
With slices of bacon for wraps ;
From the Quaker-like, brown-coated Linnet,
And the Goldfinch in scarlet and gold,
And the Wren with a song like a spinnet
From his willowy orchestra trolled ;

STRANGE idlers at corners of streets I see,
With hands in pockets that busy should be,
For we're all striking, strike, strike, striking,
We're all striking, abroad and at home!
Labour and Capital friends ? Not they !
Labour and Capital are foes in fray.
So we're all striking, &c.
Says Capital to Labour, “Why should we fight?
Couldn't arbitration make all right?
Instead of striking,” &c.
Says Labour to Capital, “Done with you !-
If the arbitrators take my view,
It's better than striking," &c.
“But arbitrators' award shall be nil,
If they don't take my view, as I hope they will,
And we'll fall back on striking,” &c.
Now strikes are to trades what wars are to States;
They eat up money and heighten rates,
Till all curse your striking, &c.
For those who fight when they might agree,
On their heads let what comes of fighting be,
And so of striking, &c.
Short hours are good, so are wages high :
But the price of work must be raised thereby,
To pay for striking, &c.
And " higher prices” mean more to spend,
But less to get for it, from end to end,
For all the striking, &c.
Now if Working--men the producing do,
They accomplish a deal of consuming, too, .
At work or striking, &c.
And the question is at what level ride
The current of price and the wages-tide,
By dint of this striking, &c.
So long as the wage-tides higher go .
Than the tides of price, they may safely flow,
By dint of striking, &c.
But a time will come, and comes ever nigher,
When price-tides stand than wage-tides higher,
By dint of striking, &c.
Then, nine hours, and ninepence an hour therefore,
May mean less to eat, instead of more,
Thanks to all this striking, &c.
So, Working-men, you should look a-head,
Lest in raising wages you send up bread
By this dodge of striking, &c.
