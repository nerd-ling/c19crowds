PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE Challenger was ready to depart for her grand voyage. Ready to sail into all the Oceans and demand their deepest
1 secrets. But there was one who lingered on board, and till he had put off, the Challenger might not go. For the
thunder-curses of the World would pursue her did she carry away Him from the midst of the nations.
“ Brave luck to you all, brave hearts," said Mr. Punch, as he slowly descended to the boat. “Would I were of
your crew."
" Would you were !” shouted the Expedition.
“ But it cannot be. So, adieu ! Go everywhere, and, if you see anything you think I should like, be sure you
bring it home for me."
“ Certainly we will, done up in wool and silver paper," laughed the Captain.
“ Then,” cried MR. PUNCH, quoting Endymion,
“Go to the Syrens, and one moment listen
Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten."
“ We'll make a point of it," said the First Lieutenant. “Give way there, you men!”
“ I shall give way if they don't,” said MR. PUNCH, wiping his eyes.
“Anon upon that Giant's arm you 'll be
That writhes about the roots of Sicily.”
“ We shall like to see that,” said the Captain, raising his voice.
“ And then," said MR. PUNCH,
“To Northern Seas you'll in a twinkling sail,
And mount upon the snortings of a whale
To some black cloud."
" Which would be a lark,” shrieked a Midshipman.
" Thence down you 'll madly sweep
On forked lightning to the deepest deep,'
shouted MR. PUNCH, nearing the quay.
“ So we will, old man !” roared the Second Lieutenant.
“ Hold your row !" said MR. PUNCH.
“Where through some sucking pool you shall be hurled,
With rapture, to the other side of the world.
Therefore, be full of gladness."

“ That's rum," observed the Boatswain.
“ It's not, Boson," bellowed MR. PUNCA, indignantly. “I'm a Good Templar. It's only my excitement.”
He was now getting very red in the face, and something hoarse, but his magnificent resolution never forsook
him.
“ After Keats, KEATING," he said, filling his mouth with the latter's cough lozenges. They gave him renewed
energy, and as he stood on the quay and waved his sailorly hat, he resumed, with the voice of a Stentor,
“ Captain, ahoy !”
." What's the matter now?" replied the Captain, through his speaking-trumpet.
“Did you ever read the Whale, by HERMAN MELVILLE ? "
“No—a—a—a!” came on the wind.
“I'm sorry for that. Fine book! If you 'll stop, I 'll telegraph to Town to have my copy sent down for you ; only
you must be sure to give it me back, because I value it.”
As the words which answered this may not have been irreverent, what they seemed to sound like shall not be set
down.
“Same to you," responded MR. PUNCH. “I'll only quote a bit from it. •Luck to ye, Captain !-luck to ye, First
Lieutenant !-luck to ye, Second Lieutenant !-luck to ye all !—and this day four years I'll have a hot supper smoking for
ye in old London. Hurrah and away!'".
“I never eat hot suppers,” çame down with the wind. “You take care of yourself, old man, and don't be too
zealous about preventing the destruction of tissue. Easy with the tipple.”
“Most ungrateful observations," muttered MR. PUNCH. “But never mind. You've forgotten something !” he
thundered, like POLYPAEMUS. “But I've sent it back in the boat. That will ensure you all sorts of good fortune.
Study it night and day, make it your compass, and your quadrant, and your Little Sea Chart.”
And then might be seen the Challenger taking on board MR. Punch's
" Sixty-Third Volume."

"Good luck to you all !” shouted MR. Punch, for the last time, and he shouted in the name of all HER
MAJESTY's subjects.

Indirect Claims as a sham and a humbug, which the Americans
meant to explode when the right time should come?
Whether we shall hear of the Claims any more-whether they are
abandoned only as regards this Arbitration - well asked, MR.
DISRAELI. Why, Sir, that depends upon whether “ Attorney-ism”
should see any advantage to be gained thereby. Sufficient for the
day is the bother thereof. Punch begs leave to interpolate a
deserved compliment to you, MR. DISRAELI, for the admirable and
statesmanlike way in which you have behaved to the Government
during the course of these American negotiations. You have kept
the Cabinet on the qui vive, but you have never harassed it. So we
reward you by making you the principal figure in another Historical
Cartoon, which has nothing to do with America. Our treatment of
the theme may seem satirical, but that is a mere detail. We delight
to set you on high among the people. And we are sure that another

POLITICIANS AND PEDLERS.
THE Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition, in his speech delivered
to the Conservative Association at the Crystal Palace, described
certain Statesmen of the other party as “ viewing everything from a
financial point, and totally omitting those moral and political con-
siderations which make nations great, and by the influence of which
alone individuals are distinguished from animals." This is an
objection to certain men and certain measures the like of which has
occasionally and not seldom been advanced by another than
MR. DISRAELI; but that other, whom modesty here makes nameless,
has always, in connection such as the foregoing, called the creatures
therein contrasted with animals mankind or human beings, and not
individuals. He has also spoken of them as differentiated from
animals not by the influence of any political considerations, but by
moral faculties or senses, ingredients of their nature, commonly
sneered at as “sentimental” by gentlemen of some intelligence
indeed, but themselves sparingly endowed with any sentiment
superior to self-esteem. Very likely, however, the author of Con-
ingsby and Lothair has to thank a reporter for altering his language
from terms which would have been used by that other person, not
to say individual. But you must bear. The sense is all. It is too
true that there are persons who subordinate all other considerations
to financial objects, and that, by having done, and persisting in
endeavours to do so, they have disgusted, and continue to disgust,
those others who are distinguished from them by qualities which
also distinguish men from pigs. Financial economists and nothing
else, bad luck to them in the grovelling policy to which they would
fain sacrifice Epping Forest.

APPROPRIATE ANTHEM?
PRINCE ARTHUR, on bis late visit to Birmingham, was presented,
in the Town Hall by the Town Clerk, with an address from the
Mayor and Corporation of that City. His Royal Highness made a
brief and appropriate reply. According to the report of a con-
temporary :-
"The choir then sung the Hallelujah'chorns from Handel's Messiah,
and with this the proceedings at the Town Hall ended.”
Taking this statement for granted, what, one thinks, could the
municipal authorities have been thinking of when they made their
musical arrangements ? That the Hallelujah Chorus was as appro-
priate to a loyal demonstration as Non nobis Domine is for grace
after dinner?' They did not, in imagination, mix up PRINCE
ARTHUR with the late DUKE OF YORK, and appoint an anthem to be
sung in recognition of his rank as a supposed ecclesiastical dignitary.
They did not fancy that PRINCE ARTHUR is the BISHOP OF OSNA-
BURG, did they? But another contemporary says that on the con-
clusion of PRINCE ARTHUR's speech, the choir struck up God Save
the Queen. That, if sung, was the right anthem, of course. But

SONG BY A “NOBLE SAVAGE.”
I AM no Market Gardener, I,
In an apron of violet blue.
I do not know any Botany,
Of Breeding I boast myself as free;
Yet I am the King of Kew.
That is, I'm in some authority
Under the QUEEN, do you see,
Maintained by a safe majority:
In an office of inferiority
I have HOOKER under me.
A Gardener he must be, I trow,
As Botany is his line.
But I don't care whether he is, or no-
He will have to pack up his traps and go,
Or my place I must resign.
A scientific gentleman,
He expects to have his way,
But when we differ about a plan,
As it ever has been since the world began,
The inferior must obey.
I'm no respecter of gentlemen,
Nor of scientific swells,
Will ye talk to me of courtesy? Then
Go talk to Bruin, in yonder den
By the Regent's Park, who dwells.
I am no Market Gardener, I,
And an ÆDILE's taste I lack,
But your indignation I defy;
For you sell DR. HOOKER myself to buy ;
And choose him to have the sack.

The ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY complained of the abominable
nuisance of the Lambeth Potteries' Smoke, and being answered,
somewhat trivially, by the Hereditary Grand Falconer (we say,
Mr. LOWE, does his Grace take out a Hawker's Licence ?), did come

remedy, and was bound to use it. Then LORD MORLEY made
courteous promise of inquiry.
The Public Health Bill was being hindered, when MR. DISRAELI,
mindful of his Sanitas dogma, tequested the House to go on, not
that the Bill was what it might have been, had Ministers given their
energies to it, but because it would certainly do some good. MR.
NEWDEGATE would say no more, as the Leader of Opposition had
become a supporter of Government. The Bill was read a Second
Time.
On the Coal Mines Bill, MR. A. HERBERT regretted that so much
was done to protect the labourers, who ought to exert their energies
and protect themselves. Dear MR. HERBERT, what is to be done
with a labourer who exerts his energy and his pick-lock in opening

not been exaggerated, and stated that Government was taking active
measures against it. We rejoice to hear it; but we hope that the

In the Commons, SIR ROBERT PEEL wished to know if any steps
were being taken to prevent the probable influxinto this country of the
Jesuits, banished by PRINCE VON BISMARCK for plotting against the
safety of Germany. MR. GLADSTONE did not think lightly of the
matter; "it was indeed a grave and serious one;” but he was not
prepared with any present reply.
Then was made the announcement that, in consequence of the
Judgment of MR. JUSTICE KEOGA in the Galway Case, the ATTORNEY-
GENERAL FOR IRELAND intended to prosecute the Roman Catholio
BISHOP OF CLONFERT, CAPTAIN NOLAN, MR. SEBASTIAN NOLAN, and
nineteen Priests, for their conduct at the Galway election. The Irish
ATTORNEY-GENERAL (MR. DOWSE) declared that his duty was plain,
but that it was very painful. There was an effort to show that an
Order of the House was necessary to this prosecution, but all the Law
Officers of the Crown had decided that it was not.
Here Mr. Punch craveth, or rather taketh, leave to interpolate a
remark which will save him trouble in the future. He raises his hat
in admiration of the cleverness which is being displayed in exalted
quarters. MR. JUSTICE KEOGH, like a rude person, has denounced a
number of ecclesiastics, and others, for mal-practices. “Remove
that profane Judge !” howleth Irishry. “Maintain the QUEEN'S
law!" shouteth Britishry. Sweetly smiling, comes the Executive,
steering notably, satisfies England and Scotland by upholding the
law, and pleases Ireland (or the rational Papists) by a prosecution
which will make martyrs of the accused Priests, and can by no pog-
sibility be followed by a conviotion. Mr. Punch has rarely been
delighted by more dexterous and adroit management. “How blest

roof “worth a visit to Dunstable to see," to show for it.
The Restoration Committee want £3,000 more. To this

ELLEN King alias MARY MORRIS, brought up on
remand at Richmond on Monday last week, charged
on her own confession with having caused the death
of her sweetheart, FRANK MARTIN, by pushing him
into a lake in Richmond Park, was, after she had been
detained in custody several days, discharged upon
evidence showing her to be of disordered mind. She
had said she “could point out the spot where she
pushed FRANK into the water.” It is remarkable that
the Richmond Police and Magistrates omitted to inquire
about that in the first instance. Most persons resident
within walking distance of Richmond are acquainted
with the ponds in Richmond Park well enough to know
that, whatsoever may be their degree of depth in the
middle, at the sides the majority of them are so shallow
that it would be impossible to drown a mouse there by
pushing it into the water, unless a pebble had been first
tied to its neck. The Richmond Magistracy and Con-
stabulary seem to be little versed in the topography of
Richmond.

Controversy and Curry.
ACCORDING to the Calcutta Correspondent of the Times,
the Bennett Judgment has been canvassed very warmly
and with much excitement in India. The Ritualist
controversy rages there even yet more violently than it
does among ourselves. These are comparatively far
more temperate latitudes than those of HER MAJESTY'S
Oriental dominions; but then one would have expected
that, in a climate so much hotter than that of England,
the whole question of Ritualism would have been nar-
rowed down to the point whether an officiating clergy-

He was met by a deputation from Loughborough, and on entering
the stable-yard was received with much cheering by a large con-
course of people. He drove off with his friends in a waggonette
drawn by greys, with postilions, to the White Hart Hotel. The
Claimant afterwards started for Loughborough, and a crowd of
10,000 persons assembled to see him depart, and cheered him
lustily to the outskirts of the town. Similar demonstrations
took place at various points on the route, and at Loughborough
almost the entire populace turned out to meet the visitor."
“Populace,” observe, not “population.” The Daily
News has a keenly discriminating paragraph-writer. It
was doubtless also the populace, as contradistinguished
from the population, that constituted the “large con-
course of people” by whom CASTRO was received, with
“immense cheering," at Leicester. We may be quite
sure that if they had not, in their own minds, believed
him really to be CASTRO, as he called himself, or, if not
CASTRO, then to be ORTON, or if not ORTON, still to be
such another as ORTON, and no bloated aristocrat, at
least no aristocrat, either by birth or breeding, and par-
ticularly not the aristocrat he claims to be, they would
never have cheered him.
The Times, however, has given our fat enemy the
hardest rap. It apprises him, through his friend, MR.
ONSLOW, that it will report nothing more about "the
Claimant” until the time comes to report “the Claim-
ant's” Trial. Punch is not surprised at this, considering
that MESSRS. ONSLOW and WHALLEY have not contra-
dicted the statement, in a respectable Hampshire paper,
that they were present at a meeting at which CASTRO
used, in reference to one of Her Majesty's Ministers,
language so vile that the reporter had to veil it with the
aid of initials and dashes. It is still open to MESSRS.

ance, and all other leagues for the legislative enforcement of total
abstinence; the Anti-Tobacco Society, and all the rest of the com-
binations for tutoring grown persons like children and coercing
them like idiots. When prigs and pedants combine to enslave the
nation, all reasonable men should unite to put down the pedants
and prigs. If they do not unite, the fussy, importunate, agitating
meddlers will go on as they have begun encroaching on the liberties
of Britain faster than the sea encroaches on its cliffs. The Sea is
entreated to excuse a comparison which is most odious. Neptune
would repudiate with scorn the foes of Bacchus.
To the Societies, therefore, which, on the dispersion of the Legis-
lature are accustomed yearly to hold their self-convoked parlia-
ments, it is very desirable that there should be added an Anti-
Fanatic Society, with the special object of opposing, and counteracting,
and making of none effect and of no avail, all the operations of
almost all the other Societies whose name is Anti, and, since they
infest us so atrociously, we may with propriety say, after the
Reporters, “whose name is Legion."
Only the Anti-Fanatic Society should do more, a great deal, than
talk. It should meet to work, and take counsel how to devise ways
and means to frustrate the machinations of the prigs and pedants,
and would-be regulators of other men's habits and appetites, to
pester the people into permitting their necks to be laden with the
yoke of paternal government. Amongst the measures desirable for
that purpose may be suggested the taking of order for the composi-
tion of songs and ballads to be sung about the streets for the purpose
of bringing fanatical bores into contempt and ridicule amongst the
common people, who will not attend to, because they cannot under-
stand, merely argumentative exposures of folly and injustice, but
whose votes determine elections. Illustrated lampoons, and squibs,
calculated to effect the same end, might also be provided for ;
rewards, for instance, or prizes offered for the best : and above all
the proper steps should be taken to confute fanaticism and humbug,

UNCO' GUID!
THERE can be no doubt that many thousands of
persons, for whom the movements of Princes and Counts
possess significance, have perused with interest a para-
graph in the Daily News, concerning :-
"THE PRINCESS FREDERICK CHARLES OF PRUSSIA AT
OBAN. - On Saturday PRINCESS FREDERICK CHARLES OF
PRUSSIA, who is travelling through the Highlands under the
incognito of the COUNTESS VON DER MARK, arrived at Oban from
Inverness, being accompanied by COUNT SCHLIPPENBACK,".
Private letters inform us that COUNT SCHLIPPENBACK,
wherever he goes in Scotland, affords occasion for re-

DOCTORS OF ECONOMY.
AT Munich, upon the occasion of the University
Jubilee, the Faculties of that seat of learning bestowed
honours on certain distinguished foreigners. The Faculty
of National Economy “conferred the degree of Doctor,"
says a telegram, "upon the English Premier, MR.
GLADSTONE, the EARL OF SHAFTESBURY, and MR. JOHN
STUART MILL." The Munich Dons might, while they
were about it, have added another eminent Englishman
to this list of Doctors. The first name thereon is in its
right place. MR. GLADSTONE has distinguished himself
as a National Economist considerably more than LORD
SHAFTESBURY and MR. MILL. Witness various labourers
and others thrown out of Government's employ. The

They both were jovial souls,
Enjoying an autumn treat.

My old man 's a-coming to me.”
“For what's the odds, Mrs. RICE,

In spite of all bother and fuss."
“And here's my old man's letter,"

THE year opened wild, which did last droo the Spring,
And the leaves all out early, and crops forrard, bring,
And the swallers and martuns to 'pear on the wing,
And the drushes and blackbirds to whistle and zing.
We shall suffer, I says, for all this here by'm-by;
And I didn't, when I foretold that, tell no lie.
For at length rainy weather come arter the dry,
And the sharp blackthorn winter the fruit killed, well-nigh.
The apples was purty well nipped in the bud,
But the pears has escaped from the frosts and the flood;
There was plenty o' grass, fit for chaw'n o' the cud,
But haymakun was hendered for cattle and stud.
Then thunder and lightnun' did gurtly prevail;
Turned all the small beer sour and most o' the ale.

If coals 'ood but come down now they'd patience requite;
But the prices o' stock makes your high meat all right.

Touchy Travellers.
THE source of the Nile appears, after all, to have been not as yet
actually discovered, but conjectured only by DR. LIVINGSTONE.
Other travellers are still at loggerheads about the question, verbal
or real, of the origin of that historical river. Travellers appear to
be a sensitive class of mortals. Their letters to the newspapers
entitle us to speak of them, generically, as Genus irritabile Via-
torum. Temper, rather than logic, is manifest in their squabbles,
and, perhaps from their wandering propensity, travellers are apt to
travel from the point at issue. This may be accounted for phreno-
logically by the preponderance of “Locality" and the other percep-
tive organs over those of reflection, which contributes to make
men roam, regardless of consequences, among cannibals.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MYSTERIOUS MACHINERY,
This is a most curiously inventive age, and in no way
perhaps more so than in the important matter of inven-
tion of machinery. We have machines for doing well
nigh everything in life; indeed, we ourselves are be-
coming mere machines, at least, so people often tell us.
Among the latest efforts of mechanical invention, we see
advertised profusely, “ The Vowel Washing Machine,"
which, clever as we are, considerably puzzles us. Fancy
washing a vowel! How on earth can it be done ? and
even when it is done, what on earth can be the good of
it? Can the liquids in our alphabet be the liquids that
are used by the machine to wash our vowels? We have
heard of persons being foul of speech, and using dirty
words and unsavoury expressions. Would a vowel-
washing machine be of any service to them ? Perhaps
if they began to wash their vowels now and then, they
might proceed in course of time to washing entire words,
and so, from being foul of tongue, they might become
quite pure and cleanly. Even slang might possibly be
purified by use of the vowel-washing process; and if a
inan were asked how he was off for soap, he might reply
without a trace of coarseness or ill-temper, “ Thank you,
I've enough to spare you some to wash your vowels
with."
Aid to Assistants.
"What is the next article ?” Is there any necessity
that this to most intelligent people irritating question
should be inevitable? The purpose of it, in so far as it
has any, would be fully answered if the question were
posted in large letters on the wall behind the counter,
in a sufficient number of places at convenient distances
apart. Then the shopman would be enabled to save
his breath, whilst the customer would be moved to cou-
sider whether indeed among the various articles on sale
in the shop there might or not be one which he might
find that he wanted when, by an effort of mind, he came
to think a little.

MODERN LEANDERS.
That must have been a wonderful scene in the
Channel the other day, when a professional swimmer
was “ performing the feat of swimming from Dover to
Calais, accompanied by umpires and representatives of
the Press, together with the Brass Band of the Royal
Surrey Gardens."
The Advertisement was a little misleading in speak-
ing of the Swimmer as “performing the feat,” for he
was able to get through but a small portion of the Straits ;
so, perhaps, there may have been some mistake about the
Umpires, Reporters, and Musicians accompanying him
in his exploit. Otherwise the unusual spectacle of all
these functionaries gallantly breasting the waves of the
Channel, the Umpires with their insignia of office, the
Reporters with their note-books between their teeth, and
the Brass Band of the Royal Surrey Gardens, with their
drums and trumpets, trombones and bassoons, playing
Rule Britannia or the National Anthem, must have
been worth any expenditure of time and money to be-
hold- a sight the oldest inhabitant had never seen before,
and the youngest inhabitant will never see again. The
Sea Serpent off Dover would, we imagine, haye bardly
caused a greater sensation.
Something Short.
On consideration, it will appear that the “Intoxicating
Liquors Act” is very happily named. The public-houses
being open, on Sundays especially, for but a limited
number of hours, people will be sure to rush to them
during those hours, in order to get their “drop of
something” while they can. Then they will also make
the most of their time for drinking, lest they should
want beer, or some other generous beverage, by-and-by,
and not be able to get any. So the majority of them
will be got to take more than is good for them, and they
will become generally more or less drunk. For the
measure of petty tyranny which Ministers have carried
allows sots plenty of time wherein to get drunk on any
day, it only hinders the sober excursionist or other decent
person from taking his draught or meal at convenient
hours. Thus the Intoxicating Liquors Act will indeed
be what its authors have called it; because the Act will
be intoxicating inasmuch as it will cause the liquors to
intoxicate, which in point of fact they would not do but
for its vexatious and mischievous limitations.

A CENSORSHIP COMING.
In Paris, it seems, no paper can publish a caricature
without receiving the permission of the person to be
caricatured! See, my contemporaries, to what a pass
the predominance of democratic ideas has brought the
French. The idea of being obliged to ask a man's leave
before you are allowed to publish a caricature of him!
Not that Punch would personally mind a law placing
him under such an obligation, for his caricatures all,
as MR. O'BRALLAGHAN says, represent imaginary per-
sons: that is to say, he caricatures nobody. His por-
traits all highly flatter those whom they are intended
for: so that they give the reverse of offence, and please
much more than the very best photographs can. He,
for his part, would care nothing for such a law as far
as it went. But restriction as to caricatures would, lere
in England, soon be followed by other restrictions on the
liberty of publication which would seriously affect you,
my dear contemporaries. Restriction has begun to fol-
low restriction in this heretofore land of liberty. Right
after right is made taxable or penal.
If you choose to stand by and see this sort of thing
done without noticing it otherwise than by otiose com-
ment, or mild protest, or even with acquiescence or
actual approval, your turn will come next, my bucks.
You will have restrictions imposed on the freedom of
the Press. The law of libel is bad enough, administered
as it is by judges who advise juries to give substantial
damages to an ass written down an ass, a quack de-
nounced as a quack, or a scoundrel proclaimed a
scoundrel. There is sufficient sympathy with rascals
and impostors (not to name any individual) in Parlia-
ment to render the Legislature quite capable of enacting
statutes devised to restrain, still more strictly and effectu-
ally than the law of libel does, journalists from speaking
out. The Liberty of Unlicensed Printing will follow in

The Press will also be subjected to a Licensing Act.

THIRTY
RIOTS AND RESPONSIBILITY.
INCULCATING the “Lesson of the Belfast Riots,” the
Pall Mall Gazette points out, for the instruction of
those whom it concerns, that :-
“What was wanted in Belfast was a man at the head of
affairs who would make the immediate restoration of order his
first business, and would shrink from no means that might be
necessary to effect it—a man who, if the police proved insuffi-
cient for his purpose, would use soldiers, and if soldiers proved
insufficient, would clear the streets by artillery."
Those whom this teaching concerns are the Government
and Legislature; whom the Pall Mall proceeds further
to instruct that no man can be expected to put down
a riot at the risk of being tried for murder by a hostile
jury; and suggests “ the creation for the time of a civil
authority who should have full powers to employ what
ever means he thinks best for the restoration of order."
Pending the acceptance of this suggestion, how are
insurrections to be quelled ? England, or Ireland, may
expect a Magistrate to do his duty to his country; but
if that exposes him to a prosecution, he will see his
country blanked first. Nobody but a strangely senti-
mental person, with a taste for self-sacrifice, would risk
martyrdom or even confessorship, by risking his neck,
or risking his liberty, except an extremely religious
enthusiast who firmly believed that he would be rewarded
for it eternally hereafter. The Belfast Riots have
shown us what we have got, and what we are likely to
get, by omission to enter a nolle prosequi in the case of

Why, the Parson and our Squire GILES,
And some of the good old race,
Would walk their twenty miles,
And be content with six brace,
And a hare or two, and a rail,
But they let us roam at large;
And the old dog wagged his tail
When he heard the words “Down charge !"
Of course we have to die,
Like the Parson and Squire, some day;
But we did not mope and cry
When we always had fair play.
And when the day was over,
At the Manor House, warm and snug,
The Shooters dined; and old Rover

May he live a thousand to demonstrate the effect of decanal occu-

we should think that the reports about his resignation of an office
which he would be able to discharge completely, even if they were
considerably impaired, were premature. CORNARO would not have
been half such a fool if he had given up his abstemious habits at
ninety-five as DEAN GARNIER would be to reject conditions far
more conducive to longevity.

DISGRACE No. 2.- JAMES HOLMES. Served at Waterloo
in a regiment of Horse Artillery. Dismissed at the
reduction of the Army in 1816, too early for him to be
entitled to a pension. Is now in his eighty-first year,
and, from failing health, unable to earn any more than
a few pence at a time. Has no relations to assist him,
so that, in the words of the REV. HENRY PARR, Vicar
of Yoxford, Suffolk, “the much-dreaded workhouse
threatens to be his home.”
It is highly probable that public subscriptions will

temporary suggests that all natives going to England
should be obliged to register themselves, so that their
status might be comprehended here. At present, Indian
shopkeepers, it is alleged, are received, in blind faith,
by gushing Duchesses and cosmopolitan Countesses.
But, after all, what harm is done ? A lady adds the

have an untutored mind, and have drowned his aged
grandmother in the Ganges, do not seem to the pur-
pose. It is more so, if he verifies the eternal telegram
from India, “shirtings unchanged," but this point is
not raised. Please, Madras Times, do not help to make

In a leader on the Strikes impending or threatened,

some remarks appropriate to the breakfast-tables on
which it lies in proximity to muffins and hot rolls :-
"The sympathies of the Public were entirely with the men in
respect of the inordinate amount of labour which they were
required to perform. But in jumping from the extreme of
quiescence under acknowledged hardship to that of uncompro-
mising dictation, they have forfeited those sympathies, and
should the people of London be put to serious inconvenience by
the strike, they will not forget to whom they owe that inconveni-
ence, and they will witness the sufferings of the men on strike
with indifference."
No; not with indifference. Now that Combination

able of strikes, the sufferings of the men on strike are the
only protection against Trades Unions the Public have.

liberately determine to deprive the public of bread, it is
with quite another feeling than indifference that the
Public will see them, through their own act, served with
their own sauce; namely, nothing to eat with nothing.
Complacency is rather the feeling with which we see those
who have annoyed us rightly served.

WEDDING THE SHANNON.
'Tis a wedding that I sing,
Of a bride without a ring,
Such a wedding as was seldom seen before ;
You think I may be frantic,
But the Bride was the Atlantio,
And the scene was on the noble Shannon's shore.
In Limerick, I'm told,
Is a custom very old,
'Tis the wedding of the Shannon and the sea :
Far as the Mayor can aim
A dart, the people claim
To levy for their port their little fee.
So the Mayor and many more,
With meat and drink galore,
Steamed out to spend at Shannon's mouth the day.
'Twas just to throw the dart,"
And secure, on Limerick's part,
From the City to the ocean the full sway.
But the Mayor, good MR. CLEARY,

Then he drew a good long bow

And the arrow flew away into the waves,
And the boys all laughed and cheered,
Though a few “wet blankets" jeered,
And talked about the people being slaves.

A LARGE FARM.
THE new Sheriffs have bound themselves by oath “not
to 'let to farm' the shire of Middlesex or the gaol of
Newgate." At first sight this seems a superfluous pre-
caution against any possible abuse of their office on the
part of the Sheriffs; but there may have been good
reasons, which the Corporation and the Livery think it
best to keep to themselves, for pledging MR. ALDERMAN
WHITE and MR. FREDERICK PERKINS not to convert
the county of Middlesex (including Newgate) to agri-
cultural uses, or turn it into grass and arable land. We
should, however, feel more comfortable if, next Michael-
mas, steps could be taken to guard against the possibility
of the Sheriffs turning the area of the Royal Exchange
into an orchard, or laying out Billingsgate as a croquet
ground, or transforming the Guildhall into a winter
garden, with opportunities for music and dancing in the
evening-any one of which projects is as likely, some
wet morning, to enter into the heads of the Sheriffs,
perhaps even of the LORD MAYOR himself, to the de-
struction of all peace and happiness in the City, as the
farming designs on the soil of Middlesex and the site of

THE MARCH OF REFINEMENT.
PURISTS frequently are heard complaining of the pro-
gress and the prevalence of slang, and it is certainly
distressing to a sensitive ear when a young gentleman
speaks of his papa as either “governor” or as "the
relieving officer," and still more when a young lady talks
of having had "an awfully jolly caper" at the recent
county ball. Still, a little lower in the social scale, there
is noticeable nowadays a very marked refinement and
elegance of language. One hardly would expect this in
the gallery of a theatre, and yet the cry of "'Ouse bill
on'y a penny!” has been improved, of late, to that of
“Programme or Hop'ra glass !” In certain minor
temples of the drama, as their habitués no doubt euphe-
mistically term them, beer is still the usual nectar pro-
vided for the “gods;" but we have vastly little doubt
that in a very little time rhubarb wine and Seltzer water
will be, instead of beer, provided. We entertain, more-
over, a confident opinion that fans will, on warm eve-
nings, be on hire for the fair goddesses, and we shall
not be surprised to see them bringing big bouquets to
throw to the performers. Doubtless, no long time will
pass ere Eau-de-Cologne and other scents are likewise
freely sold to the fair patrons of the drama who occupy
the highest portion of the auditorium; and, possibly,

INDEXING.
“The Congregation of the Index at Rome has published a
decree mentioning twenty-one literary works which are hence-
forth prohibited."
THE subjoined list is not put forth as containing
exactly the same works as those prohibited by that wise
body, the “Congregation of the Index,” for it would be
unfair to other countries to assume that we can claim
the enviable distinction of producing all the forbidden
books. POPE PUNCH THE FIRST, however, has a strong
belief that if the far-seeing authorities at Rome were
to interdict the faithful from reading the list of twenty-
one literary works which he has drawn up, they would
be quite as likely to succeed in extinguishing freedom of
thought, and stopping the progress of enlightened

Field-Marshal Sir George Pollock,
CONSTABLE OF THE TOWER.
BORN JUNE 4, 1786.
DIED OCTOBER 6, 1872.
For the brave dead, borne by the living brare,
The Abbey's gate of honour open wide!
He seeks his place of rest, a well-earned grave,
Between the dust of OUTRAM and of CLYDE.
The FABIUS and the BAYARD of our arms
May own in him a heart of kindred mould ;
Patient as CLYDE, as calm amidst alarms;
As OUTRAM stainless, chivalrous, and bold.
He had seen fifty years, before the deed,
That crowned his name with honour's wreath, was done :
Almost as long he waited his full meed,
And, past fourscore, his Marshal's bâton won.
Beside his grave bow more than one grey head,
Debtors for life to him that set them free:
Old heroes, some, coëval with the dead ;
And, some, the seed of heroes yet to be,
Gathered to honour him, whose life outwears
The years 'twixt WELLESLEY's India and our own:
And scarce a breast but honour's blazon bears,
And scarce a name but for stout service known.
Heads, silvered now, were dark, when, stirred by fames
From over Indus, of wild Affghan war,
We searched our maps for unfamiliar names-
Khelat and Ghusnee, Caubul, Candabar;
Heard clashing judgments on the wrong or right
Of policy that plunged us in the fray,
And little cared, while, in the onward fight,
Still Victory kept Nemesis at bay.
Then came strange news of weakness, bandied blame,
Defeat, retreat, disgrace, dismay,--and then
All England writhed with an unwonted shame,
To learn how dotard chiefs make dastard men.
Then clamour blent of grief, and fear, and rage,
From England, India, all-confounding, rose,
Which many swelled, whose duty was to assuage,
Hiding their terror in bombastic shows.
But through that storm of doubt, dismay, despair,
GEORGE POLLOCK's stout heart kept its even beat:
Happy for us, his strength could overbear
The crisis of that frenzied fever-heat.
Unfired to rashness, as unchilled by fear,
For that black news of women, children, ta'en,
Colours disgraced, and death, in van and rear,
Reddening Khoord-Caubul's snow with ghastly stain,
He hasted not, nor rested; to relieve
And to avenge would march; nor marched until
He held the strength his twofold end to achieve:.
Then, moving, moved with wisdom as with will.
His road lay through the Khyber's dark defile,
Virgin till then, then doomed its lord to know:
In vain before him yawned its guarded aisle,
Clearing his flanks he swept through pass and foe,
To where he deemed, in AKBAR's closing grasp,
Brave SALE with his brave handful leaguered lay ;
What joy to learn, ere the chiefs hands could clasp,
That Spartan band had hurled its foes away!

A MUTE MEMBER.
THE Members for Oxford, MR. CARDWELL and MR.
VERNON HARCOURT, lately dined with the Mayor of that
city, and met the High Steward and the members of
the Town Council. “The gathering was of a strictly
private character, and beyond the ancient toast, May
God preserve the Church and QUEEN, and prosper the
City of Oxford,' drank by all present in the loving cup,
no toasts were proposed. MR. CARDWELL did not speak.”
We quote this last sentence with surprise, not un-
mingled with regret. MR. CARDWELL did quite right
not to make a speech, but he should have spoken. It is
usual to say something, if only about the weather, or
the game, or the last run, at a private dinner-party.
How unpleasant it must have been for the rest of the
company, and especially for those who sat next the
Secretary for War! Surely he might have opened his
lips to them once or twice, either during dinner or after
dinner. He could not have been silent for lack of a
subject. The autumn manoeuvres alone would have
supplied him with material for a speech, much more for
a friendly conversation with his fellow-guests and con-
stituents. We hope they will not remember his silence,
to his disadvantage, at the next general election.
Notice to Trespassers.
WHILST the Law is in course of being Finished inside
of a Gaol, a black flag is usually hoisted above the penal
edifice. This serves as a sufficient notice to all those
whom it may concern. But during the infliction of
secondary corporal punishment there is no signal to
notify the process going on to outsiders. Much of the
deterrent effect it ought to have thus fails to be produced.
In future let this deficiency be supplied. Hoist a flag,
also, over the prison in which a criminal is undergoing
the cat-o'-nine-tails. There let it float in the breeze
for so long as the continuance of his flogging. For due
distinction's sake it should not be a black flag; would be
more suitable if black and blue. Better still would be
a piece of striped bunting; and, by way of a delicate

on Business."
'Tis thanks to such who know nor boast, nor haste,
As far above all envy as all fear,
That this small isle for high ends is high placed,
Still bears proud flag, keen sword, and scutcheon clear.
Then came the choice-Jellalabad relieved
'Twixt safe return-with captives still in hold,
And England's tarnished honour unretrieved,
Her legions baffled, beaten, backward rolled-
And onward march, till, in the foe's despite,
Each captive child and woman was set free,
And o'er the Bala Hissar broadened bright
St. George's flag, for the wide East to see.
Then his tough mettle the true soldier proved,
Waiting, and winning time, till came the hour,
When wavering wills obeyed his will unmoved,
And brought him warrant from the weak in power,
To march, defying danger, death at need,
And free our captives, and redeem our name;
Then, modestly he marched, and did the deed,
And stood aside while others reaped the fame,
A NICE SUM.
“The Excise duty on Wine and Sweets, in the year ended the 31st of March
last, was £193,842 178. 44d."
| What can these “sweets” be? Trifle and tipsy-cake, blano-
mange and custard, are largely consumed by the upper and middle
classes of this country, and a tax upon these and similar cates
would realise a considerable sum, and possibly enable the CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER to take the burdens off humbler articles
of food; but we never heard that the Excise interfered with the
manufacture of the sweets which appear on our dinner and supper
tables, or levied any duty on such dainty dishes. Can it be that
those popular articles of consumption, known as "sweets” in our
younger days, contribute to the revenue? It cannot. No CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER could be so hard-hearted-s0 completely
forgetful of the manner in which he spent most of his income in
early life as to tax barley-sugar and ball's eyes, tarts and toffy.
We can recall no other "sweets" but those we have mentioned, as
likely or unlikely to be taxed (except the sweets of office); and as
this is the vacation, and no question can be raised in the House on
the subject, it must be left in the obscurity in which it was found.
And rested, well content with the reward
In his own soul, the peace of duty done ;
None ever heard him charge his fate as hard,
Though his the shade, while boasters took the sun.
Patient and calm, of the right soldier's grain,
Whose hard rind hides a kernel soft and bland,
Firm in his hold of duty's rigorous rein,
To friend or sufferer open heart and hand.
Of such as he and his brave brotherhood
Is wrought the best strand in the cable strong
At which old England rides upon the flood,
Let winds roar high, and waves, assailing, throng.
Perilous Position.
MR. IRVING has been loudly and deservedly praised for his per-
formance of the principal part in the play now on the stage at the
Lyceum. Care must be taken not to heap too many encomiums on
this excellent actor, in the character of Charles the First, lest he
I should lose his head.

That, in sturdy hands of gaoler,

Of his tail, in graceful play,
“It strikes me that he who to whipcord's abrasion
Of the back of a brute in the shape of a man,
Prefers the soft workings of mild moral suasion,
Though a Taylor, can scarce be the ninth of a man;

“That because the most hardened garotting offender
Howls at sight of the lash, it is cruel to flog,
Is a notion that, if it prove TAYLOR's heart tender,
Proves even more clearly his head in a fog;

And that's the next tale of my nine," quoth the Cat.
“When one thinks of the style of garotters' attacking,

“Instead of this squeamish abhorrence of flogging,

Athenaeum the following
announcement: - “MR.
PEEK'S offer of three
prizes for as many origi-
nal essays on the Estab-
lished Church of England
has been responded to by
no fewer than 103 candi-
dates. The perusal and
consideration of these
MS. exercises, many of
great length, are now
occupying the judges, the
Master of the Temple,
the REV. DR. HESSEY, and LORD SALISBURY; but so laborious is
this work of examination, that the writers must not expect the
final decision for six or eight months at least from this time.”
I hope, Mr. Punch, your greatness has never exposed you to such
hardships as the Master of the Temple, DR. HESSEY, and the MAR-
QUIS OF SALISBURY, must now be undergoing. If the Atheneum
had said that the final decision was not to be expected “for six or
eight years at least," I should not have been at all surprised. One
can imagine that, after perusing and considering, say sixty essays,
even such pillars of the Church as DR. VAUGHAN, DR. HESSEY, and
LORD SALISBURY, might feel their zeal for the Establishment re-
laxed, and be disposed to take a more lenient view of the proceed-
ings of MR. MIALL and MR. MORLEY. They can have no leisure,
no rest, no enjoyment of life while the examination of these 103
MS. exercises (many of them, probably, badly written in two
senses) is in progress" in the intervals of business” they must be
always, not essay writing, as another great man once was, but essay
reading. It requires no very lively fancy to depict the three Judges
as reading, essays at breakfast, reading essays in bed, reading essays
in railway carriages and other public and private conveyances,
reading essays in their walks, reading essays in their dreams, until,
if such a thing were possible, they must almost wish themselves
Nonconformists, or inhabitants of some ideal state, where prize
essays are as much unknown as prize cats or prize fighters.
But perhaps the Judges do not read the essays, only meet together
from time to time for coffee, and hear the exercises read aloud by a
chaplain or secretary, for whose sufferings one feels compassion, but
in a less degree, because there is probably some attempt made to re-
munerate him for his labours. If so, let us hope that sleep never
overtakes his listeners, and that they are as cheerful, as good-
humoured, and in as full and perfect possession of their judicial
faculties after the tenth essay as they were at the conclusion of the
first.
I will only add one more reflection. There are but three prizes;
there are one hundred and three candidates. There will, therefore,
be exactly one hundred aggrieved and disappointed essayists going
about in Society, who for the rest of their lives, or, at all events,
until some other benevolent individual calls their literary powers
again into being, will consider the Master of the Temple, the Rev.
DR. HESSEY, and the MARQUIS OF SALISBURY, as utterly incompetent
to discern true merit, and three of the most over-rated persons they
ever knew.
I conclude as I began. I am glad I am an obscure person, and not
a great man, to have my photograph in the shop windows, and my
will in the newspapers, and to be liable to be called upon to adjudi-
cate on one hundred and three Prize Essays.

A YOGI ON THE KOOS.
A LECTURE on the subject of Mesmerism quoted in the Spiritualist
newspaper, contains a passage which seems to have been written for
illustration. It describes an Indian sage, in an extreme state of the
reverie which other Orientals name Keff:-
“SELF-MESMERISM IN INDIA.
“ In India devotees whose principal aim it is to realise what they call the
emancipation of the spirit,' are called Yogis. They adopt a system of self-
mesmerism. VAUGHAN, speaking of one of them, says, 'He planteth him-
self firmly on a spot that is undefiled, neither too high nor too low, and sitteth
upon the sacred grass, which is called koos, covered with a skin and a cloth.
Then he whose business is the restraining of his passions should sit with his
mind fixed on one object alone; in the exercise of his devotion for the purifi-
cation of his soul, keeping his head, his neck, and his body steady, without
motion—his eyes fixed on the point of his nose, looking at no other place
The Irish Church to disendow
A sacrilege I deemed;
To disestablish it, also,
A flagrant sin esteemed.
around.'"
We should be very much obliged to LORD NORTHBROOK, or any
other friend in India, who would have the kindness to send us a
good photograph of a self-mesmerising Yogi squatted on the koos.
With his eyes fixed on, and converging towards, the point of the
intervening feature, the Yogi would of course present to the beholder
a most fearful squint-a case of temporary strabismus, which, to be
imagined, demands reminiscence of the effect on the visual organs
produced by a wafer that a naughty little clown of a boy has clan-
destinely stuck on the tip of the nose of a baby.
Three years and more I let go by,
Ere I would office take.
My conscience it did satisfy
That sacrifice to make.
Time some have found fly fast since then;
For me that time was long.
Now conscience lets me join the men
Who did what I thought wrong.
In due time conscience wrong digests ;
Bids bygones bygones be.
From soruples vain sets statesmen's breasts,
At least the lawyers', free.
Great things of worth and intellect,
Forebode, dear friends, you do.

Thought in Trafalgar Square.
THE anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar occurred on the 21st
October. In connection therewith may be mentioned a criticism
which may perhaps have occurred to a foreigner contemplating
NELSON's monument in Trafalgar Square. Nothing can be more
natural than SIR EDWIN LANDSEER'S Lions-but look at their lower
jaws. The Lions are all chap-fallen.

THE WRONG MAN ANYHOW.
A DISSOLUTION of Parliament may not be far off. In the mean-
while isolated elections occur. A rational elector is often at a diffi-
culty to decide whom to vote for ; often, perhaps, decides on not
voting at all, as any vote would be simply a choice of evils.
However, when you do not otherwise know whom to vote for, you
may be enabled to determine by knowing whom to vote against.
The United Kingdom Alliance lately held a meeting in the Free
Trade Hall at Manchester-just the place for it; for don't they
want to prohibit the liquor-trade? Then and there they announced
their resolution'to vote at elections for no candidate who would not
pledge himself to support their Permissive Prohibitory Bill. Free
and independent elector, it is well to be taught by Freedom's
enemies.
Make a point of voting against the candidate, no matter whom-
soever, in a contested election, who will not distinctly promise to
oppose the Permissive Prohibitory Bill with all his might. .
There will then be this great difference between you and the
United Kingdom Allies. They, in voting exclusively for a candi-
date committed to go in for a Liquor Law, will, in many instances,
vote to the exclusion of a man of worth and ability.
You, if you vote against the nominee of the United Kingdom
Alliance, will be sure of voting against a tyrant, a prig, a fanatic, a
fool, or a humbug.

he does is to ask his other guest, “I say, GEORGE, · you know

GEORGE intimates that he is up in the subject; and ENGLEMORE
goes on in such an enthusiastic manner as works his friend up to
the highest pitch of excitement. In fact, GEORGE can't șit down to
his dinner until he knows all about it.
ENGLEMORE goes on—" Well, we've Nooked, haven't we, Colonel?”
He means me; and I corroborate his narrative so far with a nod,
and he's on again : “Pretty place !-0, pretty place!” (Here he
shakes his head, so as to impress GEORGE with the idea that however

And made them two judges go on most profanely.

their own persons, and, in effect, would be
the whole of them flogged at once. Animal
Magnetism is still in its infancy, but the
day may come when it will be so perfected
as to enable a skilled mesmerist to place
any number of criminals convicted of rob-
bery with violence en rapport with each
other; so that one flogging will do for them
all. This would save executioner's labour,
and greatly diminish any brutalisation
which may be the effect of its performance
on some warders.
The brutalisation possibly arising from
this cause would be minimised by the con-
trivance of a whipping-engine or thrash-
ing-machine, wherewith garotters could be
steam-flogged ; a device which would have
the advantage of inflicting stripes with a
certainty of uniform force, graduated to
order, and unmitigated in any case by
weakness of mind or muscle.

Come, what do you say to a slight dajoonay
Wid could punch and champagne, for I'm on for a spree ?”
So, widout further pressing, or bother of dressing,
Down to table they sat wid that haythin divine,
And began celebrating, wid choicest of ating,
And drinking like winking, THE INVINTION OF WINE.
And you shouted to Solon, “Stop your polis patrollin',
Where's the sinse your ould poll in, you ignorant dunce.
Is it whip into quod a celestial god,
For I'll prove in a crack that the crayther's divine.”
“Look here! have a sup, some more juice he'd sopped up
In a silver prize cup, and THEY FIRST TASTED WINE."
Said Solon, “Be Japers, put this in the papers,
For this child wid his capers is divine widout doubt,
Let's kneel down before him, and humbly adore him-
Then we'll mix a good can of the drink he's made out.”
Now the whole of this time was that spalpeen sublime
Preparing his mind for a good coorse of howling,
For you've noticed, no doubt, that the childer don't shout
Till a minute or more on their heads they've been rowling.
“ Milleah murther!” at last, he shouted aghast,
“My blood's flowing as fast as a fountain of wather;
It'll soon be all spilt, and then I'll be kilt"
Mistaking the juice of the grapes for his slaughter.
Thin glancing around he them gintlemen found
Their lips to the ground most adoringly placed,
Though I'm thinking the tipple, continuin' to ripple,
Round that sacred young cripple devotion increased,
“By Noah's ark and the Flood, they are drinking my blood.
O you black vagabones,” shouted Bacchus, “take that!”
Here wid infantile curses he up wid his thyrsus,
And knocked the entire cavalcade of them flat.
But soon to his joy that celestial boy,
Comprehendin' the carnage that reddened the ground,
Extending his pardon to all in the garden,
Exclaimed wid a smile, as a crater he crowned,
“My bould girls and boys, now be using your eyes,
For you now recognise the god Bacchus in me.
Nice Prices.
“ÉTRANGER" writes to the Times ;-
“It may perhaps interest English families intending to visit Nice for the
winter season to know that I find, on my arrival here, an advance of from
25 to 50 per cent. in the prices of apartments, bread, meat, vegetables, &c., on
what I paid last year.”
Why should “ ÉTRANGER” be surprised ? Isn't “Nice and dear”
the natural antithesis of “ Cheap and nasty" ?
Not in the Lexicon.
Bills at Railway Stations draw public attention to a ballet at one
of the Music Halls, called Vitula. A friend, but not a Licensed Vic-
tualler, whose Latin is evidently on its last legs, has got it into his
head that there must be some hidden reference in this title to that
part of the human frame, which is generally lavishly displayed in
Ballets. He may be right, but it is open to argument that the word
may describe the youthful frequenters of the Halls in question,

BUT,
Spite of Theology's bewildering hates -
Round Dogma's holds, alternate lost and won ;
Will find that not from Church-fight's flash and glare,
But from Christ's plain, pure words on that white shield
Comes all the light that all the Churches share,
That warms to fruit all growths of their wide field,
The bond that all their hatreds underlies,
And gives them all what each to each denies.
MORE MILITANTS THAN ONE.
WHAT Church but's up in arms, right hand and left
Exchanging fisticuffs with priestly unction ?
Their Levites into warring unions cleft
With mutual damnation for chief function :
In Congress, Convocation, sounds the clash
O'er disputation's waste but well-fought field;
From Conference, Council, Synod, rings the dash
Of Dogma's double-sided shield with shield;
Rather than put her weapons on the shelf,
Lilburne-like, each Church militates with herself.
Sooner than stoop her hand to such plain work
As bringing Christ's light Christian life to guide,
If she can't burn heretic, Jew, or Turk,
Each of her sects 'gainst all a tilt can ride :
Forbidden to plait halters, she'll split hairs;
In surplices, if not in straws, find quarrel;
Bid every Doxy kick the rest down-stairs ;
Call reason blind, search sin, and doubt immoral;
Then, as from faith she feels the life-blood failing,
Thrust Dogma-doses down to cure her ailing,-
A sad and sorry sight-a black look-out,
If Christian light were inside Churches cabined,
If choice of Dogmas were sole 'scape from doubt,
Sole safety to be Rectored, Poped, or Rabbined;
But through Church-Militants' drear dark chance-medley,
A wighter, brighter Militant I see-
Truth-Militant, of Dogmas foeman deadly,
Champion of Faiths, that have been, and will be

THE award of the EMPEROR OF GERMANY concedes the Strait of

Treaty of 1846. There is an old Anglo-Norman usage still kept up
in the Channel Islands—that stronghold of obsolete usages. When
a party is wronged, he makes what is called his " Clameur de Haro,"
invoking the powers of the island to do him justice.
But where the powers of the island are the authors of the wrong
suffered, in what form is the “ Clameur de Haro" to be raised?
We are waiting to see.

No King of England, except CHARLES THE FIRST, a contemporary

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE NEMESIS OF AYRTON.
LONDON has Parks for swells to show,
And snobs at them to stare :
And pretty little folks to play,
In pretty nursemaids' care:
And if our Guards, sometimes, those maids
Will with sheeps'-eyes begaile,
And maids be so much off their guards,
As on our Guards to smile,
Paterfamilias may regret
_That red-coats should have charms,
That pretty nurserymaids will have eyes
For more than babes in arms;
But not the less the Parks he'd have
For general use kept free,
Where somebodies may ride and drive,
For nobodies to see.
So as he has a Parliament,
And Parliament makes laws,
And some of them prohibitive,
Each with its penal clause;
And as he has some fools whó names
As demagogues would win,
And as these fools will use the Parks
To spout their nonsense in,-
As he remembers BEALES his bounce,
And WALPOLE's tears of woe,
And park-rails levelled with the ground,
And order rough-laid low,
He calls on AYRTON for an Act
His parks to rule and guard,
And if a spouting-place be given,
To mete it out per yard.
So said, so done : the Bill's brought in,
Discussed, passed into Law :

TEMPLARS AND TEMPERANCE.
A CERTAIN Judge used to say that there was no such
a thing as bad wine. All wines, he said, were good,
only some wines were better than others. He was a
good Judge. Mind, he said, wines, and, as a lawyer
said what he meant to say-wines, and not vinous
officinal shams. Yes, he was a good Judge. He never
got drunk. Wine never made him. It never does make
any good Judge drunk. All British Judges are good
Judges, and always were. JEFFREYS was the exception
that proves the rule. British Judges are, and ever
were, all sober. Hence the proverb, "Sober as a Judge,”
because it is seen that no amount of wine that a Judge
may drink can make him drunk.
A large number of Judges dined on Thursday evening
last at the “Grand Day" Banquet in the * Ancient
Hall of the Inn" of the Middle Temple. There did
they take not only their ease in their Inn, but also their
wine, as they are accustomed to do. Now, then, since
their Inn was that of the Middle Temple, how ground-
less, as well as arrogant and insulting, is the assumption
of which a section of teetotal fanatics are guilty in pro-
fessing a distinctive sobriety, by calling themselves
“Good Templars”! Genuine Good Templars practise
Temperance, not Teetotalism.

ACCORDING to the Manchester Guardian, DR. THIRL-
WALL is going to resign the Bishopric of St. David's for
fear lest, by-and-by, infirmities should incapacitate him
for its duties. The Church can afford to wait till they
do. It is said that the BISHOP OF ST. DAVID's was origi-
nally a Barrister, and his utterances, in both speech and
writing, evince a logic which distinguishes the legal from
the clerical (and the female) mind. His faculties, as yet,
remain unimpaired, and particularly his moral sense,
which, in the case of most Bishops and other clergymen,
is apt to get weakened or warped by habitual dogmatism,
the thoughtless or unconscientious practice of continu-
ally asserting opinions as facts. The Church will find it
difficult to obtain a successor to DR. THIRLWALL as sin-
gular as he is in that respect.

I notice at a cursory and superficial glanoe that the List is illus-

they were his children, giving them all his name. For instance,

A TRAP TO CATCH À JOKE.
AMONG the wonders of Paris is a man said to be living
at 34, Rue Ramponneau, the modern counterpart of
VALENTINE GREATRAKES. He was formerly a soldier in
a regiment of Zouaves, but some years since quitted the
Army to practise curative Mesmerism. Still called “the
Zouave JACOB,” he is reported to heal diseases by his
touch. According to the Avenir National :-
"With an aspect of profound conviction, he lays his hands on
the sick and paralytic, tells them to walk, and they depart with
a persuasion that there is an improvement in their condition.
However it may be, JACOB has not made a fortune by magnetism,
for he admits that, without adding to it the business of a hatter,
he should not know how to live."
Now, we know what you will say, some of you. You
will say that JACOB is mad as a hatter. No, JACOB isn't.
On second thoughts, don't you think that he is mad as a
Mesmerist.

By the “instrument,” coupled with the epithets which
moved the mirth and applause of his hearers, MR. ODGER
was apparently supposed by those gentlemen, and ladies
for aught we know-to mean the CHIEF COMMISSIONER

plaining of its employers, MR. ODGER is very unreason-
able towards MR. AYRTON and the Government. To
embarrass truculent Tories in office is one thing; to
attempt the intimidation of a Liberal Ministry is another;
and it was to do the former thing only, and not the

VITALITY OF ILLS.
The Post, in a paragraph headed “St. Paul's Cathe-
dral,” notices a set of lectures in course of delivery
under the dome of that building by CANON LIGHTFOOT,
D.D., “On the Early History of Christianity, and its
Influence on Society during that period." The reverend
lecturer commenced, on the evening of Tuesday last
week, with a discourse on “ The Relations of Christianity
to Society;" with reference to which we read that:-
“On the first point he dwelt exclusively last night, and in
closing a very eloquent lecture, which was listened to by many
hundreds of men, said that Christianity had been the instrument
of abolishing slavery, for although we had witnessed it in our
own day, its death-blow was declared when St. Paul said that all
men were one.""
In those same words if a death-blow has been struck
at slavery, though slavery is not dead yet, it has surely
been struck at a great many other things too, which also
still live, and are too likely to be very long lived indeed.
A death-blow has been struck at war, for instance; but
the Millennium still appears as remote as ever, and
Battle and Murder, though mortally wounded, look
likely to survive the injury they have received till
Doomsday. But slavery, one would think, should have
received its death-blow from a text considerably prior
to the one above quoted. A slave-owner, who meant to
do as he would be done by, would enfranchise his slaves.
It is not clear, though, that the author of the words which
CANON LIGHTFOOT considers to have given slavery its
death-blow enjoined PHILEMON to emancipate ONESIMUS.
A Long Story.
That interesting periodical, The London Gazette, pub-
lishes an appointment to the office of “Gentleman Usher
Daily Waiter Assistant in Ordinary to Her Majesty."
This must be about the longest title known to the British
Constitution, and completely throws into the shade all
such puny efforts as Acting Deputy Assistant Commissary
General. If the attendance required of a G. U.D. W.A.
bears any proportion to the lengthiness of his descrip-
tion, all we can say is that we hope his salary and
perquisites are arranged on a scale of the utmost liberality.
For our part, we should prefer another Court appoint-
ment, unfortunately just filled up, that of “Clerk of the
Check.”

The paragraph which contains the foregoing information

“ The Imperial party wore uniforms, and paid their respects

It is difficult to comprehend the relation of time ex-
pressed in the above sentence by words which seem to
represent persons who wore uniforms when they went
before the Pope, as having waited on ANTONELLI after
they had worn those uniforms. Did they take their
uniforms off as soon as they had left the POPE? If so,

About to visit us with imposition
Of who knows what expense ?—for fittings new,

In novel sort purveyed. And will you add,

Then shall we groan beneath a Board of Works
As tributary Christians under Turks.
THE FREEDOM OF THE BRIDGES.
(A Recitation by a Ratepayer.)
O ÆDILES, ye of this Metropolis
By name the Board of Works! With good design
You go to Government, and ask for power
To set from tolls the London Bridges free.
Traffic and trade those Bridges do impede,
Some of them, those, the central ones, which span
From bank to bank the crowded shores of Thames.
The Toll-taker, that intercepts my cab
When I am in hot haste to catch the train
At Waterloo, is a confounded Bore.
Abolish him. But Bridges there are other,
Commerce and travel whilst they not impede,
Repelling settlers with a little toll,
Which serve to keep a pleasant Suburb clear
On the other side o' the River; Hammersmith
Bridge, also Patney; think what they have done
From scall of bricks and mortar to preserve
The peaceful little promontory of Barnes,
Therewith Roehampton, Mortlake, Sheen, and Richmond,
An open piece of country close to Town.
To free surburban Bridges would add cost
To cost enough per se. And who's to pay ?
Answer me that, Sirs, you Commissioners.
They should the charges bear who'll reap the gain.
And who be they? Say you, the Ratepayers ?
First let the Ratepayers tell you what they think
Ere you extort their sovereigns for an end
To them not worth a farthing. What have they
Gained by your turnpike tolls' enfranchisement ?
For every penny saved I pay a pound.
How many rates, e'en now, the Ratepayers pay!
Assessed on each point at a monstrous rate,
Saddled, besides the Poor's-rate of old time,
With heavy rates ere these new days unknown,
Main Drainage, Education, and Highway.
PEOPLE YOU EXPECT TO MEET.
MR. SMITH, who speaks his native English with a slightly foreign
accent, whenever he returns from a week upon the Continent.
MR. Brown, who can't appreciate BEETHOVEN, but dotes upon
the bagpipes.
MR. JONES, who, when he shares a Hansom with you, somehow
never has small change about him.
MR. ROBINSON, who carefully abstains from volunteering a politi-
cal opinion until he has consulted half-a-dozen newspapers.
MR. CRUISER, who keeps a schooner yacht, but, except in a dead
calm, never ventures out of harbour.
MR. SHARPE, who, when he drops his money into the collection-
plate, can make a sixpence sound as though it were a sovereigo.
Mrs. SNOBBINGTON, who calls her little knifeboy a Page, and when
she hires a fly talks of taking carriage exercise.
MR. TYTTLE TATTLE, who, from some official source of informa-
tion, always brings the latest news of the intentions of the Govern-
ment.
MR. HODGER, who considers TUPPER far superior to Milton, and
goes ready primed with arguments to prove it.
MR. DODGER, who invariably takes an old umbrella to a party, in
the hope, by lucky accident, to change it for a new one.
Miss SNIVELLER, who keeps a sentimental diary, and bullies her
small brothers.
MR. FUNNIMAN, who cannot cut a tongue without cutting a stale
joke about it.

POOR PUSSY'S NIGHTMARE.
ALL on a bare and bleak hillside,
And there, whilst fell the frozen dew, One moment's check! To left, to right, With shuddering start and stifled scream,
One night this merry Christmas-tide,
She dreamt an ugly dream or two,
In vain she spends her little might!
She wakes-she finds it all a dream!
A shivering, hunted hare did hide-
As starved wet folk are apt to do, _
Some yokel's eye has marked her flight How kind the cold, cold earth doth seem
Poor Pussy!
Did Passy.
Poor Pussy!
To Pussy!
Though we had hunted Puss all day, Loud hungry hounds of subtle ken,
What use her five small wits to rack ? In harrying Pass we had great fun,
The wind had blown her scent away,
And thundering steeds, and hard-eyed men, Closer and faster on her track
and trust that ere this year be done
And baulked the dogs-so there she lay, Are fast on Pussy's trail again-.
Hurries the hydra-headed pack!
She'll give us yet one other run,
Did Pussy !
Poor Pussy!
Lost Pussy!
"Will Pussy ! |
There to the earth she humbly crept, Onward she strains-on, on they tear! | “For pity's sake, kind huntsman, stop! A softer wind, a cloudier sky,
There, brooding o'er her lot, she wept, I Foremost amongst the foremost there
Call off the dogs, before I drop, ...
A nice damp turf for the scent to lie,
There, on her empty stomach, slept
Are all we ask! Till then, good-bye,
Are ruthless women's faces fair!
And kill me with your heavy crop!”.
Sbrieks Pussy !!

To print they rush all,

There are letters from boys who've been tunded

And rather like it :
From boys in whose sonls ash-stick 's so sore,

Letters from parents who think their lads
The better for kicking;
From parents who argue that only cads
Can improve by licking.
A letter in English less classic than queer
From Head-Master RIDDING ;
Another from his assistants, good cheer
To the Doctor bidding.
A letter from MR. ALLAN MACPHERSON,
Papa of the victim;
But none from the "good and gentle" young person
Who cruelly licked him.
Lastly, not one letter, but a batch
Of the victim's own,

I'm a spar-decked corvette, built of wood not of iron,
I am good under steam, under sail :
No Sheffield-plate dead-weights my topsides environ,
So I ride like a duck through a gale.
By my Lords I'm about to be put in commission,
For a cruise of three years, if not four;
And for all I'm short-handed, I carry provision
Such as corvette ne'er victualled before.
Mine's no cruise to train officers, boys, or blue-jackets,
Or BRITANNIA's old flag to display ;
To observe and report South American rackets,
Or enjoy life in Naples' blue bay:
To practise manoeuvres, or study steam-tactics,
Hunt down pirate-junk or slave-dhow;
The Challenger now aims at higher didactics,
And on different quests sets her prow!

licence of heterodox Legislators to reform a Rubric or a Creed?
This is not the place wherein to enter into a theological discussion
respecting the Creed of St. Athanasius. Even if it were, all such
discussion would, on the memorialists against the use, or for the
modification, of that ingredient of the Liturgy, be wasted. They
continue to ignore, in spite of having had it pointed out to them,
that the question of leaving the Athanasian Creed alone or not ought
to depend upon the opinion entertained of its truth or falsehood.
They still require to be reminded that, if a statement, of infinite
importance if true, is true, then it cannot be too carefully retained
in its integrity, nor too frequently recited in the hearing of as many
people as possible. The idea of tampering with or shelving a terrible
truth because its declaration is terrific, could only, reason suggests,
occur to a very peculiar kind of intellect. If reverend gentlemen
believe the Athanasian Creed, and are not idiots, they would, one
thinks, rally faithfully round it; if otherwise believing, indeed, they
are wise in doing otherwise. But then, if they do not believe it,
why do they not say so? Wanted, by a numerous body of reverend
Divines, consistency, candour, and common sense.

WE imagine that a little surprise will be felt at the last two
words within the parenthesis. One would have supposed that no
man need apply for such a post as a Secretaryship to a “ Women's
Suffrage” Society. Can it be that the champions of “Women's
Suffrage” think it possible that no woman is likely to be found
adequate to the duties of the situation ?
It will look like a satire on their assumptions and claims, if the
"Women's Suffrage" Society have to stoop to avail themselves of
the services of a member of that sex, a large majority of which
is suspected of feeling a very moderate amount of enthusiasm about
the craving desire of (some) women to mix themselves up with
politics and elections.
Said Lowe, laughing, "To pay by results is my plan;
For results here 'll be nothing to pay.
Let the Challenger go: and I'll challenge the man,

For he, like myself, though he's not been to college,
And's a shallowish sort of a snob,
Has, at bottom, I'm sure, no objection to knowledge,
So long as it don't cost a bob."
And so I'm to sail on my grand cruise of science,
And a prouder ship ne'er put to sea;
In the good of my mission high souls have reliance,
Whatever the LOWE view may be.

WOULD you then know my CELIA's charms ?
She carries pug-dogs in her arms:
E'er dresses in the newest taste,
By lacing tight deforms her waist,
Bears on her head a brigand's hat,
Gay feathers flaunting high on that:
Her hair is only half her own,
The other half elsewhere has grown:
Her cheeks a dab of rouge reveal,
Her boots three inches high of heel :
Her fingers are bedecked with rings
As paltry as the songs she sings:
Her talk is slang, she votes men slow !
Unless a thing or two they know :
She loves champagne, detests cold mutton,

But, having lost, to pay forgets :
In dancing she can twist and twirl
As deftly as a ballet-girl.
Yet ne'er has learned with grace to walk,
But struts with an audacious stalk.
She treats her servant like a slave;
She spends, but ne'er has learned to save :
Loves shopping, bonnets, and bazaars;
Can skate, ride, row, and smoke cigars:
Reads trashy novels by the score,
But votes all better books a bore:
Will flirt with whomsoe'er she can-
O, am not. I a happy man!

Nobody honours our clergy more than I do, but some
of them puzzle me considerably. Last week the Ritualists
and the Calvinists took sweet counsel together as they
went up to the voting place together to cause the DEAN

I am happy to say that they were soundly beaten. Then
a very worthy clergyman, the DEAN OF NORWICH, who was
also appointed to preach, writes a long letter refusing
to do so. Now, if he believed that the other Dean
would teach incorrect doctrine, why did not DR. GOUL-
BURN preach sermons administering the antidote? Evasit.
As a third Dean wrote, or thereabouts, touching a fourth;

Freely of light to give, not grudge,
What most draws Christian heart to heart:-
That he whose life, books, sermons still,
Have shown this faith in work, word, will,
St. Mary's pulpit mounts, to grace it
With the Broad Church's Colours-PLACET!
That Charity lukewarm or worse
To BURGON and his kin should seem,-
Faith without flavour of a curse
To GOULBURN but a hazy dream :-
That a Church without power to ban,
No counter-power to bless can own;
Nor Christ's seed sprout in soul of man,
Unless gall-watered when 'tis sown. -
That what most worthy love appears
To simple folks, these guides eschew;
What most sets Christians by the ears,
That most they and their Church pursue';-
That, while the Sermon on the Mount
Stands as Christ's word of chief account,
The hands that seem the first to efface it,
Should be styled Orthodox, Non-PLACET /

The tide of battle should flow right, -
That e'en here, Bigotry's " hic-jacet”
Should be writ, and in large text, PLACET!
That still on Earth the rising tide
Of light and knowledge, in its sway,
With all the ills it sweeps aside,
Should wash some germs of good away-
That blind belief in chiefs and creeds,
And child-like faith devout, dim-eyed,
Which oft have served poor souls in needs
Where Science had been vain to guide-
Though, if on faith, not dogmas, fixed,
Sufficient simple minds to rule,-

_That serves to illumine Reason's school, -
That ill and good should thus be blent,

Of the old Obscurantist strain,
The scarlet of whose Doctors' hoods
Is of the Babylonian grain,-
Who hold that light but serves to blind ;
And reason but to lead astray,
And deem it cruel to be kind
To those who walk a wider way
Than the strait road, high dogma-railed,
Along whose marge, if they were able,
They'd string up heresies, impaled
Like vermin on a Keeper's gable-
That of all plans, on which impacted,
Truth's light is variously refracted,
This should be still an Oxford facet,
And such a large one too,-Non-Placer!
That, braving shock and counter-shock,
Oxford has trained a growing band,
Who hold that Truth is based on rook,
And Orthodoxy but on sand-
Believe that Churchmanship, though broad,
Sincere and strong and sound can be,
That who live Christian life unflawed,
Are like most Christian light to see
That to love others, not to judge,
Is the true Christian's truest part,
Bravery and Beauty.
THE Officers and Men who were engaged in the
Looshai Expedition are, it has been announced, to receive

have especially merited could be conferred upon them,
that would be something.

The warmer a welcome is mine;
Your 'hot-with' you'll find brewed, dry sheets aired for to-night, |

As wet blankets are not in your line.
A glad heart and a grateful I'll turn:
For the naked, my clothes - for the hungry, my stores -
Before a good fire you shall toast your old shins,
After turkey, and chine, and mince-pie,
For the shivering, my Wall's-end to burn!
Till the wassail-bowl's blood in your pulses begins

A NEW CHRISTMAS SONG.
(Adapted to the Times from In Memoriam.)
WRing out the clouds in that damp sky,
Which all this year so drear have made,
If, for the weather's clerk, her trade
A weather-washerwoman ply.
Wring out the old, wring in the new,
Wring, weather-washerwoman, so,
That wet-shod if the Old Year must go,
The New may damps and dumps eschew.
Wring out the wet that stands in clay,
Rots the potatoes in their bed,
Fingers and toes gives Swedes instead
Of bellies in the usual way.
Wring out my mouchoir, damp with flow
Of constant cold through warp and woof,
Bring in a patent water-proof,
Through whose seams rain-drops will not go.
Wring out the shirts, wring out the skin,
To which I've been wet many times ;
Ring out the rain-drops' pattering ohimes,
And bring some dryer weather in !

THOUGHTS DURING HAIR-CUTTING.
WILL he cat it well, or shall I look an object for the
next ten days.
Will he ask me how I would like it cut ?
Will he talk to me?
Will he blow upon me?
Will he snip a bit off my ear ?
Will he prick my lip when he trims my moustache ?
Will he tell me that my hair is getting rather thin at
the top?
Will he ask me whether I have tried, or would like to
try, their marvellous Balsam, or their wonderful Wash,
or their unrivalled Restorative ?
Will he ask me whether I will be shampooed ?
Will the brushing business bring tears into my eyes ?
Will he part my hair on the wrong side?
Will uncomfortable hairs get between my collar and
my neck ?
Will he not, when all is over, say—“Will there be
