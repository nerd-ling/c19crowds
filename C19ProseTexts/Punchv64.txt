now," eaid MB. PUNCH, " to pay my respects to the SHAH. You have, of course, seated him on my best Divan,
TOBY, which I trust you had caused to be properly dusted."
So saying, MR. PUNCH, with even a more fascinating smile than usual, entered the Chamber of Reception at 85, Fleet
Street.
"Bigarosh muck warboulh selattyn ti paglluth blocktinder," said NASSB-ED-DiN, returning the smile, and saluting.
"Batman collotJiun chenica masherbath cowfriski, dialing ahasuerus jonnycrab, halinanthus y pop grodibungus," replied
MB. PUNCH, bowing three times as he alone can bow.
"If you prefer to talk English," said the SHAH, "pray do."
"I prefer it very much indeed, your Majesty. Permit me to observe that I am immeasurably and inconceivably
honoured by this condescending visitation, and that the day will be dear to me as the most distinguished and fortunate period
of my existence."
"That is humbug, and you know it," said the SHAH.
"It is humbug, and I know it," said MB. PUNCH. "But I desire to exhibit my accomplishments to your Majesty."
"Exhibit your grandmother, and give me a pipe," said the SHAH. "I thought I had come to one place where I
might talk plain Persian, leastways English, and hear no flammery-flummery."
"To hear is to obey," said Ma. PUNCH, clapping his hands. Three housemaidens, of extreme beauty and neatness,
instantly entered, and various exquisite refreshments were placed before the illustrious pair.
"Not bad-looking moon-faces, those," said the SHAH, as the maidens, with deep reverence, withdrew.
11 Beautiful myself," said MB. PUNCH, " I love to see myself reflected in all about me. May I offer your Majesty some
sherbet?"
"Sherbet doesn't go off with a bang, and effervesce like that, at least in Persia," said the SHAH. "Are you sure you
use the right name?"
"I am like Humpty-Dumpty, Sire, in Through the Looking -Glass (elegantly illustrated by my friend, JOHN TENNIEL),
and when I wish a noun to mean anything, I make that noun mean what I wish. This is sherbet, Sire, made by a meri-
torious French widow, from a recipe found in the writing-desk of Shampagnecharlemagne, heretofore King of France."
"When at Home we must do as they do in Rome," said the SHAH, pensively.
"No, you mustn't, Sire," returned MB. PUNCH, " or you would do without honesty, drainage, punctuality, and soap
and water. But in my office you may do as I do. Lachshibboloom tommy warboy," he added, raising his glass.

"Bong flippas dindij gudgeon," replied the SHAH, returning the courtesy. "By the beard of the Prophet, that
widow knows what she is about."
"Most widows do," said MB. POUCH. "And how do you like us Eag'ish, my successor of DABIUS?"
"Who was he?"
"How should I know, Sire? But it is th? right thing'to say. We '11 make it XBBXES, if more agreeable, as it is
equally idiotic."
"I am a Kadjar," said the SHAH.
"We have many of your namesakes here, Sire, only their name is spelt with a variation. Your revered father was
MOHAMMED, and his illustrious predecessor was FETH ALT, who succeeded to the magnaminous AGA-MOHAMMED, founder of
your unsurpassable dynasty."
"You know everything, I believe, Berglerbeg."
"That, I think, is Persian for Governor, Sire. Yes. My eye and FREDERICK MARTIN have told me several things
about Your Majesty, within the last week. But I am not proud, as every one of my contemporaries has availed himself of
the same authority. Is the tobacco to my Lord's liking?"
"Houri's breath," said the SH\H, piously. "Now, can I do anything for you? Do you want any diamonds?"
"I make them, Sire, and sell them at three pence a packet. No, Your Majesty, PUNCH asks nothing of Kings except
that they would follow his counsels. Those who do not, have a habit of soon ceasing to be Kings. You are wise. I learn
that you are going to develope the resources of your country, with the aid of my frioni SIR JULIDS DE REUTER and his
capitalists. I wish your Majesty brilliant success. Lackshibboloom. How do you get on with LORD ORANVILLE?"
"He is a delightfu man. He speaks French beautifully. But"—(whispers).
"But your Majesty wan ts him to speak English?" said MB. PUNCH, winking.
"I confess that I would rather have six words than sir hundred from a friend, when I have told him my need."
"We '11 square it, Majesty. I have sent for him. He is in the next room. We '11 have it out with him, and your
Majesty shall return to Teheran with your face whitened before the peoples, and shining like the moon in the firmament.
Jump up, Sire! Jump, my bounding Bactrian! On to the book, Sire! We will march upon the Foreign Minister in an
impressive manner. Steady, Lord of the Lion and the Sun."
And in this wise went the SHAH and MR. PUNCH to confer with LORD GR\XVII.I,E.
(The result to be revealed at a fitting season.)

LJNES TO MY LADY-LOVE.
(9y a Common-place Ptrton.)
To thcc, were I a humble bee,
I 'u hourly wing my honeyed flight;
To thee, were I a sbip at sea,
I 'd sail, tho' land were in my sight:
To thee, were I a puasy cat,
I 'd spring, as tho' 'twere on a rat!
To thee, were I a stickleback.
I 'd swim as fast as fins could more;
To thee, were I a hunter's hack,
I 'd gallop on the hoofs of love:
But as I 'm but a simple man.
I '11 come by train, love—if I can!

The House of Commons dearly loves my

Without it, too, some folks would bo
athir^t.
My second is what certain snobs admire,
And far more useful than a c-.ml fur fiie.
My whole is what my wholo must have

Of use to Sweeper, Sailor, or M.P.
I 'm from the deep, or (rum tho richest

Or from the forest. On the railwAy-lino

I 'm blessed by suiuts, though of tun
cursed by sinucis,
Whom I have kept away from festive
dinners.
T»ke me to China and you 11 find that tea
Is nothing when a Mandarin sees mt.
So think me over, meditate, and guess,
And if you 're light, depend ou 't, I '11
say " Yes."
A SUGGESTION.
'FROZEN over is the pond, love.
Dearest KATE,
Let us therefore, O my fond love.
Go andskfite."
1 But the ice is so thin,
Wo might both tumble in.
'1 ra la la la!'
1 Well; but if a drag wo borrow,
What do you fray about to-morrow?"
"Ask Mamma."
ADVICE TO SPONSORS.—Never name the
boy to whom you stand godfather, JOHN
EDWARD. The diminutive of JOHN ia
JACK; that of EDWARD is NEDDY. Tho
latter diminutive is bad enough by iUelf,
but the former, prefixed to it, makes
it twice as bad. Plain Donkey, an appel-
lation sufficiently opprobrious, becomes
doubly objectionable when expanded
into Jackass.

MEDITATIONS UPON MATRIMONY.
(By a Married Man.)
LIFE is beset with dangerous tempta-
tions. When you take your wife down
Regent Street, always leave your purse
at home.
In connubial arithmetic, a husband
must be reckoned as less than half a
man when his better half is with him.
Pity tho poor gentleman whose wife
•tcill have a latch-key!
Marriage would in many cases be a
blissful stato, if it were not for cold
mutton.
When you detect a wife's unusual affec-
tion for her husband, you may expect
to see her before long in a new bonnet.
Pleasant is the Derby Day with bache-
lor acquaintances; but a trip to a West
End jeweller's is a costly price to pay
for it
If your wife says, "Dear Mamma is
coming for a week or jo," you may pre-
pare your mind to receive her for a month
or two.
Lovers sometimes rave about tho sun-
shine thatgilds a married life; but, when
they come to bask in it, they find it Is
mere moonshine.
SONG ON ST. CUTHBERT'S DAY.
"EASY Bhaving! Easy Shaving!"
Legend still above my door;
In the breeze whilst boards ore waving;
Men get shaven now no more.
Cutting and shampooing only,
I with snaps ana grease run on.
But my little shop is lonely,
Now tho Barber's Trade is gone 1

NEW- YEAR GREETINGS FROM ALOFT.
MB. POXCH, with his accustomed frankness and generosity, freely
admits that it was a Happy Thought which incited the Daily Tele-
graph to give us, on Christmas morning, a gratulatory message from
nearly every place where Englishmen abide in this Planet. He
expects that his contemporary, and all his contemporaries, and the
Universe generally, will as chivalrously recognise the still Happier
Thought which prompted him to arrange that all the Planets should
send him messages on New Year's Day. He has the greatest pleasure
in laying these upon the face of the Earth, or rather upon its tables.
Jflftcurg.
Happy New Year to you! It must be a bore to you to have only
one New Year's Day in 365. We have one in 87. This is because
Mercury is made of quicksilver. Very hot weather. Our neigh-
bour, Sol, is poking up his coals like fun. Wish we could send you
some of our grapes, which are about the size of your pumpkins.
We are very happy, and pur beloved Knra SALAMANDER is going to
be married to ,the beautiful 1'ui SCKSS ASBESTOS. They spend the
honeymoon in the State Volcano.
Bijou are exceedingly like the scenery in the Moon, bat your ladies
have two eyes, which is ridiculous. We have, however, no such
splendid being as Amazon-Queen HELEN BABBY.
We wish you all joy! Venus has been looking towards you many
evenings of late, but you are all too busy with your noses turned
dn w u to your mud, to look at her. Our best love to the A STKONOM K R-
ROYAL, and to MR. LOCKYEB. We are perfectly happy here, so we
have nothing like what you call news to send you. Our fruits and
flowers are glorious, and all the silver fountains of perfumed water
are in full play. Ivory Temple of Aahtoreth being rebuilt. Com-
pliments to MB. SwixnuHNK, the poet.
STfje JJloott.
We send yon the proper greeting, but there is no very good feeling
towards you. You have dragged us with you into horrible atmos-
pheres, and we have hardly had a glimpse of the Sun for a moonth.
You are always bothering over reforms, can you not agitate for a
repeal of the union between you and us, and then we should glide
away, like one of your balloons, into pleasanter regions? We
noticed your gas-strike, and pitied you. The last scenes in Sabiland
The Red Planet salutes you. Butyou are a slow lot. Why don't
you get up a good war or two? We had hopes of you last year.
When you do get at fighting, however, we allow that you do it
handsomely, and we are pleased to see that you are making the
most awful guns ever heard of. Soon may you have occasion to use
them, and we drink to the early glory of the Devastation. No time
to say more, as all we heroes have to get uncommonly drunk out of
The Skulls to-night.
Jupiter.
So your little year has come round again! Well, such happiness
to you as you are capable of feeling. We pity your barbarous and
uncivilised condition very much, and would send you missionaries,
but the smallest dwarf among us would terrify you into fits, as a
Monster. We could send you mighty news, but you could not com-
prehend it, still, perhaps, you may manage to understand that in one
of our four little Moons there has been disaffection— something like
your Fenianism— and that we sent over six Mammoths, who stamped
it out in the twinkling of a star. Well, little Earthmen, creep
about and be merry, there is plenty of room for you in space, and
there is some reason for your existence, no doubt, as there is for that
of our toad-glowworms, which are about your size, but much
handsomer.
Saturn.
The " Chilly Orb on the Verge of Creation" sends a word to the
invisible speck calling itself The Earth. Yon must be a curious
nest of animalcules, probably noxious to one another, though
incapable of doing harm to your superiors. Here we are without
passions or wishes. Exist, if it amuses you to do so.
©ranus.
Happy time to you, little folks! Have you heard from Jupiter or
Saturn t Don't be humbugged by their preposterous airs. Because
they are big, they think they are great. It 's not an uncommon
blunder with you, as DAN TK, MILTON, and SHAKSPEABE told us the
last time they came here to a festival. We know all about you, and

admire you awfully, with deductions. Oar news would not much |
interest you, or you should have it; but look out for such a jolly'
comet. He '11 be with you in 9765 of your years. You '11 hear |
something? to your advantage, for he is going to bring you within a j
million miles of us—if he doesn't swallow you en route. Don't have:
any nonsensical ideas about Uranus. We are most delightful people, |
and your RABELAIS comes and reads his book to us. We are always
laughing, and what we hear about you makes us laugh more than
anything else. You must be awful fools, but that's your misfor-
tune. Be jolly while you may.
Cfje Sun.
I hope you are quite well, as this does not leave me at present.
Fact is, I am under repair. Bat what a set of little idiots you are!
You go splashing about into unlucky atmospheres, get yourselves as
wet as you can, and then abuse me, because, in drying you, I make
clouds come up, and you can't see me. I 'm all here, my dear little
Earth, so don't frighten yonrself. Don't believe a word that chap
FIGUIER says about your folks coming here some day. I wouldn't
have you at any price; and he's an idiot. 1 hear that little fool of
a moon of yours is giving herself airs. If you were worth a ray,
some of you would find your way to her, and teach her manners.
DR. CROLY told you that it oould be done easily, if you only knew
how. But that's your look-out. Mind, I intend to dry you tho-
roughly, and until that's done yon '11 see very little of me. How-
ever, you can go on bellowing, if it amuses you, but after all these
years you might know better.
Uesta.
0 my dear Earth, don't speak to me. I used to like you very
much, but really your conduct— and you get worse and worse. I do
hear such things! There really can be nothing between you and me
until you alter very much indeed. I would wish yon happiness, but
it can come only with virtue.
I cannot do better than quote the words of your own poet, who
is good enough to visit me sometimes :—
"Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
Long continuance and increasing;
Hourly joys be still upon you,
Juno singj her blessing! on you."
Otrrrs.
I hear what Juno says, and I imitate her :—
"Garth's increase, and foison plenty,
Barns and garners never empty,
Vines with clustering bunches growing,
Plants with goodly burthen bowing,
Spring come to you, at the farthest,
In the very end of harvest,
Scarcity and want shall shun you,
Ceres' blessing so is on you."

It is a curious fact, but one well-known to skilled geologists,
that, scattered in the drift of certain parts of Cambridgeshire, fossil

Members of Convocation will no doubt rejoice to learn that DR.
GOHLBOUBN has most thoughtfully invited MB. SPUBGEON and
DEAN STANLEY to visit him at Norwich, for the purpose of preparing
a scheme for the amendment of the Athanasian Creed, and for intro-
ducing certain liberal reforms into the rubric.
At a recent festive meeting of the Royal Academy, it was pro-
posed and carried, nemine contradicente, that in future no R.A.
should have the privilege of hanging any picture "on the line,"
unless it were adjudged to be deserving of the place by the voice of
a Committee yearly chosen by outsiders.
It is not generally known that RAFFAELE, the "Old Master," as
we presume to call him, was in reality a music-master, and gained
his fame as an artiste by playing airs upon the banjo in the cars of
New York railways, where the tunes which he performed are still
own as RAFFAELE'S Car-toons.

According to a rumour which is current in the Navy, the Lords of
the Admiralty have decided that a yacht shall be constructed, for
their use, upon the BKSSEMEU invention for preventing marine
nausea.
MR. PETER TAYLOR has signified his wish to assist at the next
prison whipping of garotters.
It is reported at the Clubs that the Rangership of Hyde Park will
be offered, in the middle of next week, to MR. ODGBR.
So averse is ME. GILPIN to the punishment of hanging, that he
will not even let a bit of Christmas beef be hung upon his premises.
Provincial readers doubtless will hear with deep regret that the
gallant Corps of Beefeaters on duty at the Tower will in future be
filled only by the strictest Vegetarians.
The world will hear with some surprise that the Estimates, next
year, will be framed upon a plan for abolition of the Income-tax.
PERSECUTION ABROAD AND AT HOME.
REFERBINO to BISMARCK and the Governments of the German
Empire, the POPE, in his late Allocution, was pleased to observe:—
"These men, heaping calumny on ridicule, do not blush to attribute per-
secution to Woman Catholics."
Persecution, we all know, is an enormity of which Roman Catho-
lics are, and ever were, incapable, on their own principles. The
Inquisition persecuted heretics by burning them no more than
criminals are persecuted in being hanged. When will the world be
made by Infallible Holiness to see that Roman Catholics cannot
possibly persecute; can only be persecuted? They are manifestly
persecuted by disability to exterminate heretics by law. MR. DAW-
SON BURNS appears to consider himself and his associates persecuted
because they are not empowered to suppress the trade in generous
liquors by a Permissive Prohibitory Act. Doubtless this view of
the case is also taken by l)n. MANNING, the advocate, likewise, of
compulsory total abstinence; and with equal reason the titular
teetotal Archbishop might complain of the ill-usage he endures, in
common with Roman Catholics generally, inasmuch as they are
denied, even in a district where they constitute a majority of the
ratepayers, the right to vote for the abolition of all places of worship
but their own. All this is so clear, and BISMARCK and his like
must know it so well, that, unless lost to all sense of shame whatso-
ever, they could not attribute persecution to Roman Catholics with-
out blushing; yet, as the POPE says, it is too certain that they do.
One of the Best Compliments of tin Season.
THE Zoological Society have, with great propriety, awarded a
Medal to MR. BARTLETT, the able Superintendent of their Gardens.
Remembering a recent interesting event in the Regent's Park, we
should not have been surprised to hear that MR. BAHTLETT had been
made a Companion of the (Hippopotamus's) Bath.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
ow, Mr. Editor, for Your Re-
presentative Man to go tome-
where onBoxing-night,was
an absolute necessity. But
where? I, as Your Repre-
sentative, tried Drury
Lane, and couldn't get in
—no, not three days before,
and Covent Garden was
equally ont of the ques-
tion. If these two were
full, where next? The
Alhambra. The applica-
tion was satisfactory, and
what Love might not have
been able to do was effected
by Money. Crowded in
every part: even up to the
Oriental pigeon-holes at
the very top, from which
elevated position only the
heads of the performers
could, by any possibility,
have been visible, when
they approached the foot-
lights, with the bodies
under them horribly fore-
shortened, or rather flat-
tened into mere lumps.
Anybody visiting the Stalls at the Alhambra Theatre, should
practise some sort of gymnastics in order to render himself suffi-
ciently lithesome for the position necessary to be assumed on entering
any row of these seats. If your Stall is in the centre of a row (as
mine was) you must incur the wrath and hatred of all those on
whose toes you are compelled to trample, the anger of all in front
against whose back hair you can't help brushing, and, finally, the
loss of your own temper at being complained of by others, when
you yourself are suffering torments from the unnaturally angular
attitude which you have to preserve in progression. Revocare
aradus is equally unpleasant, unless your neighbours have quitted
before you. Your Representative's advice to intending stall-occupiers
is, "Look at the plan, and don't take the seats at the back, opposite
the entrance, as there are no doors, and there is such a draught.'"
The Alhambra was unlucky as aBoxing-night choice. It announced,
as a "New Grand Spectacular Opera Bovffe Feerie" (whatever
that may mean). The Slack Crook. The most important person
in it, however, was a Miss JULIA SEAMAN, who played a tragic
Indian Princess without the least attempt at fun. She played it
very well, and, though at a considerable distance from the stage, I
heard every word of her part, which is saying a good deal for the
Alhambra, specially on Boxing-night. I was not any happier
•when I had heard it: but this wasn't the lady's fault. ,Mu.i:.
COSKEUE D'AJTKA did not appear, and a clever lady read her
speeches and sang her songs. This was unfortunate.
How they manage to produce a Spectacle at all on so small a stage
is a marvel, and one is almost inclined to add what Da. JOHNSON
said about the wonderful performance on the violoncello. The piece
lasted from seven till past eleven; and this after the excisions which
Monday's and Tuesday's performances had rendered indispensable.
In JBabil and Bijoa} which has set the fashion for this style of
entertainment, there is something to laugh at—I mean MB. BaoUGH
and the Turtle, besides the procession of the Origin of Man, with
Lord Dundreary and the Ape,—but in The Slack Crook there is,
at present, nothing laughable, though, as there is plenty of room
for improvement, some witticisms or practical fun may, in course
of time, be introduced.
The Biche au Bois, in Paris, was full of startling effects and
pantomimic changes. These, probably on account of the limited
stage appliances, are omitted, and hence one strong element of its
popularity is wanting.
The Costumes are for the most part brilliant.
Your Representative was pleased to notice the excellent terms
that some of the gorgeously-clad warriors of the ballet were on
with their admirers among the audience. There was no pride, I was
rejoiced to see, among these ladies, although they were dressed so
finely. They had, I imagine, some capital jokes on the stage, as,
•when one of the performers spoke, the supers and chorus went into
convulsions. I was glad to see them enjoying themselves, but
the humorous jests, whatever they were, did not reach the row of
stalls where Your Representative was seated. MR. FREDERIC CLAT
has written a song for Miss KATE SANTLEr, which is likely to be
popular: it was the one cheery thing in the piece, and was
deservedly encored; nay, if I remember aright, it was demanded
three times. If there are many draughts on that stage, it strikes
me that the young lady just named will be a sufferer.
There were ballets in plenty fairly danced, but with nothing
grotesque or laughter-movm? in them, such as playgoers, in holiday
time, love to see from the VOKES'S at Drury Lane, the DAUBANS,
formerly at the Gaiety, and the PAYNES, till now, at Covent Garden.
In short, The Slack Crook, as a whole, is uncommonly dull;
but as anything, however absurd, may be introduced into such an
Extravaganza without injuring the dialogue, situations, or story, it
is not unlikely that the Management will hit upon something to
give that amount of "Go" to the entertainment, which, as now
represented, it most certainly requires.
Your Representative has nothing more at present to say of the
Theatrical novelties, but hopes to make a speedy round, and report
progress. There are two duties at Christmas time: one is to go to the
large West End Theatres, and the other to visit the Grecian, and see
what ME. CONQUEST is doing. To save Paterfamilias trouble, it may
be as well to state that there is a Pantomime at the Princess's and
at Astley's, and morning performances at the Big Houses on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Poor Pantomimists, 'tis
enough to make you all turn tragedians! Wishing everybody gene-
rally, and you, Sir, in particular, a Happy New Year,
am ey r, YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
THE WEAKIEST WAIT OF ALL.
(Sit the POPE'S Christmas Allocution.)
THERE 's a sound that at still Christmas midnight
Comes fltf'ully borne on the gale,
Of carols, to sleep that forbid night,
With their quavering, querulous wail,
And their wind and string burden sonorous,
As much out of tune as of time—
Then we know the Waits' regular chorus,
And stop ears against music and rhyme.
More and more grow the Waits, whom the season
Into voice is too certain to call,
Whose rhymes have their more or less reason,
With " Give, give!" for key-note of all.
But through e'en their most dolorous singing,
Am! orack'dest of music, we know
A faint far-off echo is ringing
Of the Bethlehem choir long ago.
But there's one old Wait of this Christmas
Whose carol is saddest of chime,
As he calls on a deaf world to list mass,
In a tune that is all out of time.
Through the night, that for him ever darkens,
Still droning his descant of wrong,
In the ears of a world that but hearkens,
To grumble, "Hang him and his song!"
Poor old POPE !—o'er the wide waste of waters,
No more by his dykes kept in hold,
He calls on his stray sons and daughters,
Broke loose from the Vatican fold;
But his voice, through the midnight all moonless,
Awakes nor regard nor reply,
And hollow and empty and tuneless,
Comes back, on the night-wind, to die.
Christmas rev'llers, as homeward they royster,
Old Wait after Wait may pass near,
Some to tavern addrest, some to cloister,
And some to whoever will hear;
But of all the old Waits on their trial,
Whose waiting is hopeless as thine.
Who wait'st till the hands of Time's dial
Shall backwards for forwards incline?
Affirmative Negation.

[JANUARY 4, 1873.
A TEETOTAL CONFESSOR.
By both consumers of generous liquors, and total abstainers from
them, the following: extract from the Morning Post will be read
with interest and sympathy:—
"THE FIBST PLEDGED TEETOTALLER.—The national penny subscription,
on behalf of JOHN
KINO, the first man
who, in 1832, at MB.
JOSEPH LIVKSKY'S re-
quest, signed the total
abstinence pledge in
England, has just been
closed. KINO u nearly
77 years of age; his
sight is very defective,
and nearly gone; his
wages as a gate-keeper
on the Southport line
of railway are very
small, and his income
has not been such as
to enable him to make
provision for his old
age. The subscription
has not much exceeded
£300."
By a curious co-
incidence, the para-
graph above quoted
is followed by a
recommendation of
that "celebrated
and delicious old
mellow spirit,"
KINAHAN'S LL.
Whiskey. To many
readers this will
suggest the very
improper surmise,
that if a man does
not wish to live to
be reduced to desti-
tution in his old age,
he should abjure
thin potations and
addict himself to
spirituous liquors.
Poor JOHN KING,
the 8,ged Teetotaller
in distress, will, to
the eyes of too
numerous persons
of another way of
thinking than SIB
WILFRID LAWSON
and that of the KEY.
DAWSON Brntss,
present himself as
an awful example
of the effects of
total abstinence.
Some bibulous pa-
rents will perhaps
even be so aban-
doned as to point
this abstemious man
out to their children
with the same object
as that with which,
on the other hand,
the Spartans used
to exhibit a drunken
Helot. These con-
siderations render
it very desirable that
the subscription-list
on MB. Ki.MI'S be-
half, which has been
closed, should now
be immediately re-
opened, chiefly in order that the lovers of generous liquors may
exercise their generosity by relieving the necessity that has fallen on
an exemplary person—relief which will be generous the more that,
under their adversaries' banner, he hag come to poverty.
THE NATION'S NET PBOPIT.—That of the British Fisheries.

Syuaan (thinking of the Weather).
Milkman (thinking of his Mtilc).'
A STRIKE IN THE CHURCH.
WHERE is the prevailing epidemic amongst the Working Classes to
stop P It has now extended to an order of Working Men not accus-
tomed to work in their shirt-sleeves, or in flannel jackets, or caps of
brown paper. The Timei, a few days ago, contained the following piece of ecclesiasti-
cal intelligence :—
"REMEDIAL CAI.A.-
MITV, — The London
Correspondent of the
Birmingham Gazette
states that four Curates
at Richmond struck
on Sunday, but the
Vicar, being a man of
energy, summoned as-
sistance by telegraph,
and was enabled, not-
withstanding the de-
fection, to get through
ten services in two
churches."
There is, how-
ever, to be noted
this distinction be-
tween the Working
Men of the Trades'

sons; that the lat-
ter, in the case
above specified, did
not strike for higher
wages, as most
Curates have more
reason to than any
other of the labour-
ing classes. They
appear to have
struck on behalf
of Ritualism against
a Vicar who insisted
on asserting Church

ciples, ouch astrike
is remarkably dif-
ferent from that
whereby the Stokers
were like to have
plunged London in
darkness. A general
strike of Ritualist
Curates would, so
far from that, have
precisely the oppo-
site effect, in the
opinion of all men
except those whose
conscientious bat
illogical convictions
have induced them
to pin their faith on
a system of pseudo-
Popery, or whose
really ill-considered
priestcraft has con-
tracted the suppo-
sition that people
are to be led by the
nose with it.
There is an old
aphorism, of high
authority, which
should make Cu-
rates loth to strike
for any cause what-
soever. Every Cu-
rate may be said to
carry a Bishop's
crosier in his portmanteau. A word to the wise is sufficient without
recourse to objectionable " iteration."

JANUARY 4, 1873.]
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HAPPY THOUGHTS.

s we are abont to
leave the room,
MlC K I.KTON Stops 08.
"Look here!" he
says, chuckling:
again, and more
than ever, "I 've
got another. Only
tell me^if you've
heard it before."
\V,,- promise him,
''•' and stand in at-
tentive attitudes.
(Wonder if he 's got
many of these.)
"I don't think
you have heard it,"
he goes on; "because
I made it myself."
Happy Thought. —
Hope he doesn't
make many things
himself. Wine, for
instance. I remem-
"This is it. 'When
\ does an Alderman go
on four legs ?'"
'When he rides," suggests ENGLEMORE.
'No, that's not it!" chuckles MICKLETON, delighted at his first
failure.
'I can't guess," I reply.
'0, you can."
'No, indeed, I can't. I never could."
'Ha! Ha! Ha I " he laughs heartily. "I asked lots of fellows
in the City, and they couldn't make it out at all. Old DUMPIER
bothered himself over it for half an hour or more, and as to MA.GENDIE
I thought he 'd have gone into tits when he heard the answer. Ha!
Ea! Ha!"
"What is it P" asks ENGLEMORE.
We are both getting hungry, and I 've just stopped a yawn.
"I '11 tell you." replies MICKLETON, winking rather to himself than
at either of us, An Alderman goes on four legs when he becomes a
Mare. Eh? Good P isn't it?"
"Ah, I see," says ENGLEMORE. "Lord Mayor." "Capital."
"Capital," I echo. Then both keeping up a laugh, we once more
attempt the door, ENGLEMORE observing that he's afraid we shall be
late.
The Cuckoo coming out at that instant, is of the same opinion.
He only rushes out for one second, or less, to cry " Cuckoo" at the
banging the door after him, as if
lusiness to attend to within at which
on any account. He was too quick for me,
and I haven't seen him, as yet.
"Half-past six," I say, moving towards the door.
"Plenty of time," observes our host, "we 're never very punctual.
By the way," here he stops us once more, "talking of riddles,"—we
weren't, but that is of no consequence to him—" I made one the
other day as I was going up in the train."
We can't help ourselves. ENGLEMORE can only murmur sadly,
"Colonel Conundrum," and yield. I never saw a man so suddenly
and completely depressed as ENOLEMORE after these two riddles, and
in the presence of a third.
Happy Thought.—Look at my watch and slightly yawn.
No good. MICKLETON must tell us this. If we 've heard it will
we say so P "Why is a Charity-boy"
Brilliantly Happy Thought.—Yea, we have heard it. Very old
one.
• " No, no, it's not the one I mean," he says.
"Quite the same," returns ENGLEMORB, turning the door-handle.
MICKLETON goes on,—
"When is a Charity-boy like a blue-bottle P"
"Give it up, Massa Bones," says ENGLEJIOHE, in despair.
Do 7 give it up? Certainly. Certainly. What is it?
"Weil," says MICKLETON, amazingly delighted at his third suc-
cess, "the answer is, when he's buzzy. Ha! ha! ha!" He roars
at it.
We are a bit sulky. ENGLEMORE observes that it's not so good
as the others. I agree with him.
"No!" exclaims MICKLETON. "Then I 've got a better. It's a
first-rate one. I met little PINKER at BIRCH'S the other day, and
asked him. He said it was the best thing he 'd ever heard. Look
here. 'When is the PRESIDENT or THE UNITED STATES '"
Here the door is pushed open from the outside. MBS. MICKLETON
enters in full dress.
"What, JAMES! not gone to dress yet? It really it too bad.
The dinner will be spoilt, and I shall be kept waiting."
Here a bell rings loudly.
Happy Thought.—Leave the Riddlemaker to explain. We go to
our rooms.
I 've come down here to learn about Gardening and Farming, and
he's not said a word on those subjects at present. ENGLEMORE calls
him Professor. Of what? Conundrum-making?
Happy Thought.—Dinner.
We have a very pleasant dinner. MICKLETON introduces different
wines to us of rare excellence.
Remembering that I have oome to learn a great deal from him
about farming, I try to turn the conversation in this direction.
It appears that if there is a subject which both MICKLETON and
his wife carefully avoid, it is farming. As for horticulture, MRS.
MICKLETON informs me that " she has become quite tired of flowers."
Speaking, I think, at her husband, who, while pretending to be
completely absorbed in giving ENOLKMORE the remarkable history
of a dinner claret, is clearly uncomfortable, she goes on to say,
"The fact is, I have been so long down here without seeing
anything except flowers, or anybody except the gardener, that I
have become utterly weary of them.
With a secret feeling that I am siding with my hostess against
my host, but that he, as a man of the world, will understand this
politeness, I reply, "Well, yes, I suppose that it must be a trifle
dull."
"Very dull," she returns emphatically. "It's all very well for
you gentlemen who have got your Clubs and your business in town,
to come down for a day now and then" (such a look at MICKLETON,
who smiles feebly at ENGLEMORE), "and say you enjoy the country
so much. But it would be a very different thing if you were
obliged to stay here, all alone, from one year's end to the other."
"0, well I exclaims MICKLETON, jovially, "we '11 take a house
in town for the season, next year, and you '11 enjoy this place all
the more when you return."
"My dear JAMES," replies MBS. MICKLETON, with a sarcastic
smile, "you 've said that every year as long as I can remember, but
you Ve never done it."
MICKLETON tries to laugh it off, and I see that by showing myself
interested in farming and gardening, I have evidently put my foot
in it.
Happy Thought.—Take my foot out of it. Change the topic at
once. Ask MICKLETON if he's going up to town to-morrow. He
frowns at me rapidly, and shakes his head. I 've put my other foot
in it It seems that I 've got both feet in it, as MRS. MICKLETON
takes the reply into her own month,
"Of course he '11 go up early to-morrow." *
"Business," I hint, faintly, in order to do MICKLETON a friendly
turn.
"There can't be much business going on, as my husband is
always complaining of what's not being done in the City; but if he
makes a new Conundrum, or thinks of a good story, he's not happy
till he has gone up to the office and told it to all the people who call
themselves his friends."
"My dear!" interposes MICKLETON, evidently wishing to restrain
his wife's remarks before us, and in the presence of the footman.
However, as a large stand with an enormous bush occupies the
centre of the table, ne is hidden from her as completely as I am from
ENGLEMORB, whose eye I only manage to catch through the leaves,
or by dodging a little on one side.
"It's quite true, my dear," she continues. "And then, ME.
ENOLEMORE, just before dinner I often receive a telegram to say he
won't be down that evening, in consequence of having to meet
somebody who is of the greatest importance to him."
"Well," says the unfortunate Conundrum-maker, "I do have
to meet people who are of great business importance to me, at
dinner."
We (his Guests) smile.
I say, "Of course you have," and smile. ENGLEMORE winks
privately at MICKLETON, but is detected by MRS. MICKLETON,
when he laughs, and observes that "Boys will be boys," which,
though meant kindly, does not exercise a soothing influence on our
hostess.
"Boys, indeed?" she says. "I should think so. From what
I 've heard, they 're a nice set of boys, too, on the Stock Exchange.
And when he stops in town, as he's always doing—on business—he
comes back with a lot of Conundrums, as if his trade was to make
Christmas crackers, and then he drives all over the country asking
these. But it's very dull for me down here, as you may imagine."
Happy Thought.— MARIANA in the Moated Grange.
Luckily, at this moment, ENGLEMORE changes the conversation by
asking MRS. MICKLETON if she '11 assist him at his House Warming,
when he proposes having Theatricals and.a Ball.
MARIANA of the Moated Grange jumps at the idea. So does

M ic KLKTOX. So do I. Anything to get rid of the unpleasant sub-
ject. We all go in heartily for ENGLBMORE'S scheme.
M ic HI, ETON, seeing his wife in so excellent a frame of mind, won't
hear of her quitting the room, as she is the only lady, and it would
be dull for her in the drawing-room. She stops with us.
Consequence of this is that the only topics interesting to me are
tabooed, and I have come down here for—nothing.
It's late in the year. The Gardeners from GTTTCH'S are, I suppose,
hard at work at the Nook. I should like to ask MICK LKTON, who, I
still believe does farm (or why should he have received us dressed in
a shooting-coat, clodhopping boots, and gaiters '•), what one ought
to do in the garden at this time^-viz., just the end of the year.
Will catch him in the morning. 1 decide upon this to myself
while they are discussing the house-warming.
M i c K I/ETON asks ten Conundrums—his wife encouraging him now—
before we take our candles for bed.
MICKLETON comes up to see that I 'm " all comfortable."
Opportunity not to be lost.
Happy Thought.—Seriously, before going to bed, I ask him,
"You know all about gardening. What would you do in a small
garden at this time of year, with only one gardener and a help ''"
He pauses to consider. He looks at the floor. Then he looks up,
shakes his head knowingly, and replies, "I know; I've heard it
before. It's like the ship weighing anchor, and drawing four feet
of water, and what's the name of the Captain P SMITH, eh?"
He thinks it's a riddle. I am about to disabuse him of this
notion, when ENGLBMOEE looks in, and says,
"Hallo I Colonel Conundrum out again r" Whereupon he and
MTCKLETON both laugh heartily, the latter observing, jocularly,
something about an old bird not being caught so easily; and then
they both say " Good-night!" and retire.
Evidently I shan't get much gardening information out of Colonel
Conundrum. What a habit for a man to get into 1

THERE is a sweet savour
Suggesting the flavour
Of what in mine youth was a great treat to me.
I nose it, whilst roaming.
Sometimes, in the gloaming:
Sally Lunn at the fire somewhere browning for tea.
0 joy I can't utter,
Hot tea-cake, with butter,
Or mulliri, or crumpet, all gushing, galore,
When young lips were squeezing!
, 'Twere now full as pleasing
As it then was when these at their corners ran o'er.
Hot rolls, of a morning,
To shun I 've had warning,
But now love as much as I ever did, quite.
The middle piece, crummy,
And oozy, and plummy,
Would still yield me all its remembered delight.
Toast, likewise, I dote on,
Hot, buttered, oft gloat on,
With eggs, in idea, for a morning's blow-out.
But that, for digestion,
Is out of the question.
So I breakfast on porridge for fear of the gout.

AT THE CHURCH-GATE.
Ethelinda. "IT'S RAINING! WHAT SHALL WE Dot"
Edelgitha. "HAPPY THOUGHT! LET us WAIT FOR AFTERNOON SERVICE!"
THE PHILOSOPHY OF ADULTERATION.
FBOM a pile of letters addressed by Retail Traders to a well-known London firm
of condiment and provision merchants, namely, MESSRS. CBOSSE AND BLACK-
WELL, dealers who refuse to put copper into their pickles and preserves for the
purpose of colouring them in order to please the eves of idiots to whom food is
repulsive that does not look pretty, Food, Air, and Water extracts the following
sample :—
"We are sorry to inform you that our customer has returned the case otpetitspots on
account of their bad colour; it is, consequently, thrown on our hands, and we shall be
glad if you will take it back, as we have no sale for a cecond quality. If you have any-
thing better, we shall be glad of your quotation, but they must be perfectly green."
Like their customers. The British Tradesman very commonly incurs a
great deal more than his due share of censure and satire for the roguery of
which in too many instances he is guilty of adulterating provisions. The blame
ought to be fairly divided between him and the British Public. It is a fact,
for instance, that anchovies had, for a long time, if they have not somewhat
generally still, to be dressed with red-ochre for the British market. Without
the addition of that pigment (not fit even for pigs) they would have been less
marketable. The quality of knavery on the part of the seller of sweetmeats
and condiments coloured with salts of copper and arsenic, and other poisons,
is to a great extent developed by another quality on the side of the customer.
"FooU are the game that knaves pursue."
The latter class of our FeJIow-Men would not so greatly abound in South
London, and elsewhere, as they do, if the former were less numerous.
Table Talk.
MBS. MALAPBOP, when dining out lately, was heard to ask for some Paragon
V megar, and to admire the beautiful order in which her friend kept her

THE SAFE SIDE OF SPIRITUALISM.—Seeing is not believing.
SEYMOUR, SAY LESS.
0, DUKE, had yon not spoke so fast,
But on your tongue clapt hobblers,
Remembering "Each man to his last,"
Holds good of Dukes as cobblers,
And owning that Dame Nature may
Refuse e'en SEYMOURS one sense,
At Newton Abbot, t'other day,
You 'd not have talked such nonsense.
When GLADSTONE, wishful Arts to grace
'Gainst claims of Science swingein",
On one^brain-level claimed a place
For fiddle and steam-engine—
The courage was not his who dared
The bold juxtaposition,
But SOMERSET'S, who straight declared
GLADSTONE a bad logician.
"Fiddlers," you say, "on squeaking strings
Have scraped three hundred years,
Yet what good from their fiddling springs
To asses, through their ears?"
COLUMBUS sneeringly you name
In a breath with PAOAiran,
And hint that Genoa, meting fame
To both alike, 's a ninny.
You sing in raptures, warm for you,
The locomotive's glory,
How its touch changes old to new,
And lifts the world a storey:
How, while its grasp links sea and land,
The lightning's fettered fires,
In Science's strong harness stand
Ready to ride the wires.
All true, my lord Bake, and what then P
What idiot e'er denied
The load that Science lifts for men,
When to toil's levers tied?
Who e'er compared what violin
And steam-engine can do?
Unless some Duke of donkey-kin,—
(Of course I don't hint who.)
Not less each perfect work of Art
From a great master's hand,
With Science's best work hath part,
And claims as high to stand.
And though a SF.YMOUK, and E.G.,
At STBADUABIUS sneer,
I 'd rather STBADUARIUS be
Than e'en a SEYMOUB'S peer.
Economy in the North.
"THIS Glasgow St. Andrew Society will give prizes of £21
and £10 10». respectively, for the best two Essays 'on the Jaco-
bite Episode in Scottish History, and its Relative Literature.' It
is desirable that the Essays be within suoh compass as to be read
aloud within two hours."
By St. Andrew, these thrifty Scotchmen are deter-
mined to have their penn'orth! Ten guineas, or even
twenty, for an Essay which may take two hours to read
aloud, cannot be condemned as a reckless expenditure
of money; especially as it is stipulated that the copy-
right of the successful Essays snail be the property of
the Society. After thinking the matter well over, we
have determined not to compete.
Fen in your Teeth!
A NEW YORK firm (so a paragraph in the Times in-
forms us) has this year imported 15,000,000 goose-quill
tooth-picks.
Let our American cousins, above all the editors among
them, be grateful.
Every feathered goose that furnishes fifteen tooth-
picks robs fifteen featherless geese of as many pens.
Punch, much suffering under a nightmare of Christmas
correspondence, calls this "quill-driving in the right
direction "—to honest picking of teeth instead of wicked
raising the wherewithal to keep them going.

Although an Allocution is not exactly a Boll, yet, in
grappling with the former, the German Government re-
gularly takes the Bull by the horns. The POPE is to be
honoured for haying the courage of his opinions to a
degree which is exemplary in .these times of truckling to
the gregarious "wish" and "opinion." It is really a

"National" editors, agitators, and home-rulers. On

Ireland any extra quantity of butter—in that consign-

[JANUARY 11, 1873.
WHY IS MR. GLADSTONE HATED?"
HE Spectator, having pro-
pounded the above agree-
able question, and having
given its own answer, is
followed by the Pall Mai,
Gazette with an answer
of an entirely different
kind. The former journal
says, inter alia—
"The same intense hatred
for MR. GLADSTONE crops
out where you generally look
foronly lukewarm sentiments
of any kind. The Saturday
Review, which has no intel-
lectual raiim d'ttre eicept
the depreciation of warmth
of conviction of every kind,
and a mild preference of the
common-place because it is
common-place, seldom men-
tions M a. GLADSTONB'S
name without a passion that
seems to amount nearly to
loathing."
The Pall Mall intimates
that the reason why ME.
GLADSTONE is hated is to
be found in—
"certain tendencies of eccle-
siasticism — its dreamy be-
nevolence, its impatient
despotic temper, its too ingenious subtleties, its womanish obstinacy, it) in-
tellectual unscrupulousness, the facility with which it imposes untruth for
truth on the mind of him who is given over to its influence, and the mischief
which the domination of such a spirit naturally brings into the daily work and
the practical life of a nation."
Now this cannot be pleasant reading for the PHEMIEK, or his
friends, or society generally, we trust, when it is saturated with all
the sweet and healing influences of the Christmas season, and when
universal philanthropy is disturbed by nothing but incessant indi-
gestion. Is this the way to be writing while holly prompts the jest
and mistletoe the kiss P Is this the sauce for pudding, the spirit for
mince-pie? How can amiable journalists sit down to pen such un-
kindness when very likely they dined with their beloved aunts
overnight, and expect to meet all their affectionate cousins to-
morrow? Where are the gentle bands that draw closer as the new
year is born? Where are the sweet sentiments that should crop up,
unshaved—we mean unshamed— as the glad bells proclaim peace
and goodwill? Truly, truly, and with melancholy tears in our
manly eyes we write it, if Christmas can do no better for us than
this, we fear that Christmas must be an everlasting humbug. Might
we ask for the smallest glass of Cognac?

THE HARROWING OF THE HELLS.
(DECEMBER 31, 1872.)
Is depths of Pandemonium
Is weeping, woe, and wail,
AMnodeus and Ashtaroth
Droop each a doleful tail:
And Beelzebub, disheartened,
Can scarce prick up an ear,
The New Year's allocution
Of PARE RENABD to hear.
For this day sees the closing
Of the year, and something more—
The shutting-up, in Vaterland,
Of Hell's long-open door:
The last spin of the little ball,
The last turn of the card,
The last chant of the Croupiers,
The Devil's cri de garde—
"Faites votrejeu,
Messieurs!
Messieurs,
Faites votrejeu.'"
In Hombourg and Wiesbaden,
If we had eyes to mark,
Though AI '('•<•, Oours, and Kurcaal,
Salle, and Redoute, and Park,
Are hov'ring baffled squadrons
Of devils, blue to-day,
At the flitting of their patrons,
The Potentates of Play.
KING BENAZET, like BOABDIL,
His Baden riding through,
Utters farewell for ever
His ancient realm unto:
KING BLANC on brow of Taunus
Would draw his bridle-rein,
For a long adieu to Hombourg—
But that he goes by train!
So "Faites votre jeu,
Messieurs!
Messieurs,
Faites votrejeu!"
From forth the Knrsaal portals
Issues a funeral band,
Black-coated, white-cravatted,
With cards and balls in hand:
Croupiers that bear the tables—
Dead tables!—to their tomb,
The cloths with squares and numbers
Laid o'er like palls of doom.
With devils for pall-bearers,
That skip on either side,
Whose noir to couleur changes,
In effort grief to hide.
And sad those Croupiers' bearing,
Those Inspectors' faces long,
As their Hell-gates behind them
Clash, with the mocking song—
"Faites votrejeu,
Messieurs.'
Messieurs,
Faites votrejeu.'"
0 European rascaldom,
0 French cocotterie,
And you, that world-wide order,
Chevaliers d'Industrie!
How is your glory vanished,
Your richest seed-field shorn,
Your fattest, happiest hunting-ground
How hungry and forlorn!
But comfort ye, in Monaco,
By San Sebastian's shore,
The Gates of Hell, if here shut up,
Will open wide once more!
Or if not, there are Bourses
And Money-Markets dight,
Where more than double zero
Rewards the adventurous knight—
There, "Faites votrejeu,
Messieurs!
Messieurs,
Faites votrejeu.'"
While of all Saints, Saint Mammon
For most of us is head,
And a purse devoid of money,
The aevil we most dread,
Let prim and pious Emperors
Shut up the Kursaal Hills;
While roguery keeps the kernels,
What good to smash the shells?
With JAY GOULDS o'er the Atlantic,
And their good cousins here,
Why should Chevaliers d'Industrie
Their fate forecast in fear?
Long will it be ere rascaldom
Needs table, card, and ball,
Must droop its head, throw up its hand,
In answer to the call—
"Faites rotrejeu,
Messieurs!
Messieurs,
Faites votrejeu!"
From the French.
A RADICAL, but handsome M.P., was observed, the other night,
alking volubly to an exceedingly obese lady. Remark thereon
wing made to a French Gentleman, he eaid, "0 yes, he is aceus-
omed to address the masses."

to-morrow. Our
party, little Un-
cles and Nurse,
&o., to be moved
at once to The
Nook. As I shan't be up in Town again for some time, more reason
to take advantage of it now.
At dinner, a Gentleman, who was at the Grecian Theatre on the
first night of the Pantomime, tells us " something that will amuse
us." Thinking over it afterwards, it strikes me as a
Happy Thought.—To put it into verse.
ENGLEMOHE says, "Do so, BARKINS, and come out as Mister
Reciter."
Without coming out as Mister Reciter, I put forward the follow-
ing rhythmical version, which I call
A BALLAD OF BOXING-NIGHT.
Sting the Narrative of what happened to an Eastern Youth, who had
saved up Sixpence in order to go and sec the Pantomime on Boxing-
nigld at the Grecian. A fact.
BILL MIVJNS, hero of my rhyme,
Height five feet, boots and socks in,
Vowed he would see a Pantomime
Upon the night called " Boxin'."
An " arrand boy " from door to door
Is honest BILL. "And which is
Better, a arrand boy what's poor,
Or arrand knave what rich is?"
He saved his earnings; and this way
He had a goodly store got—
Fippenee three fardens. Yet a day
And he 'd one farthing more got.
These small coins filled his pockets in
An inconvenient manner;
Says BILL, "Forthis 'ere 'eap o' tin
I '11 get a silver tanner."
Tanners are sixpences, and so
Are "tizzies,1' also " benders ;"
Thia doth a wealth of language show
Common to our East-enders.
Far happier BILL on Boxing-Day
Than any monarch regal,
He 'd got the wherewithal to pay
His entrance to The Eagle.
At, six the doors would open wide,
Not earlier or later,
And then he soon would be inside
The Gre-ci-an The«yter.
Joy beamed upon BILL Minn's face,
Framed 'twas by two locks curly;
He cried, "I '11 have fust gallery place!"
And so he went there early.
"Fust come, fust served," he thus observed,
Alone at half-past four there;
But in an hour, despite a shower.
There were some ninety score there.
How to hold on BILL understands;
He pushed, he backed, he tussled;
He needed elbows, arms, and hands,
That he might not be hustled.
His treasured Sixpence, in his right,
Was in no trifling danger;
He saw that it next minute might
Be collared by a stranger.
Scores more from East, West, North,"and South.
Says BILL, "Here's vere I'll put it."
He popped the Sixpence in his mouth,
Ana, having done so, shut it.
Each man his neighbour now opposed
(Describe the scene can no pen),
BILL sorooged, but kept his mouth well closed
Until the doors should open.
They 're open now! the first rush in!
BILL MIVINS would have followed,
But for a blow upon the chin—
And SILL the Sixpence swallowed!
Now, carried onward by the stream,
Each bent on getting a place,
He stopped, all dazed, as in a dream,
Before the dreaded pay-place.
He had no money. Gone his all!
They shout, "Now then! the man pay!"
"Get out!" says a Policeman tall;
"Let them adwance as can pay."
Outside the Grecian walls BILL sat,
In double-deep dejection,
He thought upon the Sixpence: that
Was food for hia reflection.
At a bright thought his tears he dried,
And then upon the flat way
He stood upon his head, and tried
To get the Sixpence that way.
Then he "turned wheels," as street-boys do,
But he made nothing of it;
He tried gymnastics all he knew,
Without return or profit.
A Chemist's? Should he—no, or yes?
He feared an operation.
BILL would be charged, too, if success
Should crown the speculation.
Once more he stood upon his head,
Policemen wished to take him;
But he explained, and so, instead,
They only stopped to shake him.
They held him like a man that's drowned,
Until he turned quite dizzy.
Success at last their efforts crowned—
Gug—guggle—"Here's the tizzy!"
When he came in, the gallery cheered
The triumph of his long quest;
The Grecian youth had persevered,
And his reward was COKQUEST!
The Last Outrage.
IT appears that we are resolved upon finally alienating one of our
noblest Colonies. In the journals last week appeared a notice of the
demise of a gentleman, and there was added, "Canadian papers,
please copy." The gentleman's name which our friends are asked to
copy is'' COTTNT M ABSOETJSHEWSNOTT." American States, please annex
—after this it would be childish to affect to wish to retain Canada.

IN regard to this last arrangement, there are some venomous
perrons who would quote a certain speech hy Lady Anne to Richard,
Duke of Gloucester, touching the only place for which she considered
him fit. But this would be most improper. India, however, is
not too warm for MB. A YKTON, as he came thence, and we own
that, if love of his natal soil should prompt him to demand an
oriental appointment, our compassion for the poor Indians and their
over-tutored minds would not conquer the more selfish feeling with
which we should hear the news. EARL SPENCER has long been
heartily tired of Ireland, and this we cannot understand, as he must
have plenty of excitement there—Fenian plots, Belfast riots, and an
aeranan outrage twice a week ought to be enough for the most blase
official. "Tipsy last night, and tipsy again this morning; what
more would you havef Do you want to be a hansel ?". was the
just remonstrance of a "flesh-and-blood" husband to his grumbling
spouse. As for shifting MR. BBUCE, we have had our little quarrels
with him, but he is a valuable official, all the same, and we would
rather make shift with him than shift him to make room for MR.
C ii i T.DKHS, for the fact that MB. CHLLDERS does not show off well in
sudden debate is not absolutely convincing proof that he would
make a good Home Secretary. On the whole, quieta non movere,
which was SIB ROBERT WALPOLE'S motto, would Be an excellent one
for MR. GLADSTONE, in this and other matters. He is too good a
man to play cards, we dare say, but he may take it from those who
are not so good that a hand is not strengthened by mere shuffling.
But he understands the theatre. Let him borrow a hint from Mr.
Punch's Cartoon, and insist that his actors shall be thoroughly " up
in their parts," and show proper respect to their generous benefactors,
the Public.
Our OF PLACE AXTOOETHEB.—A Frog on a Toadstool.
SENSE AND SOBRIETY.
IN a leader on the recent speeches of the two Members for the
City of Oxford thereat delivered, the Times made the very juat
remark that " MB. YEBNON HARCOUBT seems to have gained more
applause than his sober colleague." That which seems to have been
the case in this instance was indeed so, and no wonder. MR. VERNON
ITAKCOURT talked genuine, and not Ministerial, Liberalism. He
insisted on the point that an essential principle of Liberal policy is
the maintenance of personal liberty, and he declared that principle
to have been violated by .certain excesses of paternal legislation, fit
only fur a puerile people. MR. YEBNON HARCOURT condemned the
vexatious and restrictive Parks Regulation Act, and the more
restrictive and more vexatious Licensing Act. He therefore gained,
as .he was well entitled to, "more applause than his sober col-
league." The sobriety ascribed in that phrase to a Cabinet Minister
means reticence on the subject of Liberal complicity with Teetotal
and Sabbatarian tyranny. The epithet, sober, applied to MB.
CABDWBLL, is eulogistic of MR. YKKNOX HARCOUBT, and not the
contrary.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN,
Be, as usual, addresses tlie Editor, and writes some account of the holiday
performances at Drury Lane, and the Olympic.
H, SIB,—I am unable to go
everywhere at once: I
cannot be in more than
two places at one and the
same time. I have even
tried doing two places at
once, and have failed. _ I
cannot cram all the Christ-
mas pieces into one week's
notice; no, not if you
were to give me two
columns, each as big as
NELSON'S or the DUKE OF
YORK'S, to do it in.
There are many I can't
go to, in time that is to be
of any 1 use to the public,
and there are some 1 won't
go to. I am speaking as
Your Representative, i.e.,
as the Representative of
your known obsti I
mean firmness and de-
cision.
I represented you, Sir,
at Drury Lane. Every-
body said you were looking
very well. But that is
neither here nor there. MR. E. L. BLANCHABD'S Twenty-Third
Comic Annual is entitled (for the title is no longer a secret,
and I am at liberty to divulge it) The Children tn the Wood.
Sir, Your Representative laughed most heartily, and enjoyed it
most thoroughly, being of the audience's opinion that, taken
altogether, it was the best thing in Pantomimes he'd seen for
some considerable time. MB. FREDERICK YOKES is the Cruel Uncle,
all legs and moustache. Apart from his inimitably grotesque dancing,
his quiet pantomimic acting is something first-rate in this peculiar
line. The performance of the MISSES VICTOBIA and ROSINA VOKES,
as Master William and Miss Mary, is capital throughout. They
always play as if they thoroughly enjoyed it themselves, and
though the most extravagant steps are performed by them, they
never once overleap the bounds of propriety, nor even so much as
suggest vulgarity; and this fact, in these nothing-to-wearisome
days and can-canistio times, is well worthy of note and very much
to their credit.
But, Sir, what a dear old pathetic tale it is. Despite big heads,
despite all the fun of the fair ones, despite rum-tum-tiddy-iddy
tunes, when the poor Babes, faint and weary, lie down on MB.
BEVEBLEY'S mossy bank to plaintively yield to hunger, and, loving
boy and girl, to embrace for the last time on earth in the sweetest
and purest affection, and in each other's arms to die, I warrant you
that from the topmost boy in the gallery above, to the oldest habitue
in the stalls below, all momentarily experienced a choking sensation
in the throat, and, feeling just the slightest moistening of the eye-
lids, were much relieved when the old rnm-tum-tiddity-iddity
struck up, and the queer squirrels and comic birds came hopping
with their pantomimic leaves to destroy the illusion. I am speak-
ing, I know, Sir, your distinguished sentiments when I say that all
who visit Old Drnry will thank Mu. BLAHCHABD for flavouring his
Christmas bowl of pantomimic and burlesque merriment with just
this one drop of the essence of the story's poetry. Thepathos of the
familiar situation is charmingly and touchingly rendered by the
two Yokes Babies aforementioned.
For the scenery—" May every blessing wait on my BEVEBLEY, my
loved BET—— . . . but oh! how unlike my BEVEBLEY I "—it is not
so bright as usual. The Dreamland scene, however, is pretty enough,
and the tableaux illustrating old nursery rhymes and fairy stories
are most effective.
The comic scenes of the Harlequinade are carried on with much
spirit; and the two Clowns, MESSRS. EVANS and HARVEY, have some
good fooling. The former had better take a friendly piece of advice
and omit the pail from his trombone performance. A nod is as good
as a wink from Your Representative in his own little stall.
I have not yet been to the Adelphi. Little WAGO after supper
gave us a specimen of MR. EMMETT. the American actor, and I
smiled at the Emmettation. I made this joke as Your Representa-
tive. I also announced that MB. BAIEMAN had become an Irvingite.
Borne one said he 'd heard this before. I then asked the new Conun-
drum, "What part of Grammar is Remorse?" and somebody an-
swered, "The Syn-tax;" which is, strange to say, the answer.
This brilliant conversation decided me upon visiting, next evening,
the Olympic Theatre.
Without Love is not a Christmas piece, thank goodness! and
therefore, at this season, does not call for special notice. Suffice it,
that such a piece, however well played, can never enlist the sympa-
thies of any audience, whether French or English. There is in it no
Virtue to rob Vice of its reward, and all the characters are morally
bad—past hope of redemption—with the exception (as far as Your
Representative could understand the matter) of FIFINE and SUZANNE
(waiting-maids), and VICIOBINE and CECILS (professional bride's-
maids), whose gloves appeared to have grown grey in the service.
These were the exceptionally good people among the women.
Among the men 1 had my doubts about the virtue of Armand the
Coiffeur: but as, in such a state of society, it is a relief to doubt, I
am inclined to give him the benefit of it, and pronounce his guilt
not proven. The three other Goody-goodies were Messieurs Caba-
iii /, Jules and Henri, who appeared for a few seconds in the last
Act, only to be told that they were ruined men. They had been
asked, poor fellows, to a Wedding Breakfast. They were the
"Company"; and, as the Company, they had to hear about the
smash of the Commercial Company in which they were deeply in-
volved. They bore it with exemplary fortitude. One smiled
slightly, and appeared a little bashful. That was the effect of the
news on him; nothing more. He was the youngest of the party,
and 1 pitied him, for it seemed to me that the sudden shock had
turned his brain. The well-bred, imperturbable servants elicited
my warmest admiration. MR. RlGNOLD drinks champagne, and
immediately dies. Whose Champagne was it t Here s a chance
for Advertising Wine Merchants I "CAUTION.—Beware of Inferior
Wine. THE CHAMPAGNE which exercises nightly so fearful a
power over MR. RIONOLD of the T.R.O., is not TUB FIRST-CLASS
ARTICLB SOLD nr," &e., &c. Here would follow the name of the
firm, who forthwith should bring out an entirely new brand, and
patent it as the "five Cliquot!! or, Rignold Reviver." But I
have said that this is not a Christmas piece, and I have to answer
the question proposed in the bill, namely, How I found Crusoe?
I found him going; on as well as could be expected, or indeed
better. It is certainly one of the prettiest things in London, in the
way of scenery, costumes, and music. The idea seems to have
been originally a very good one, bat its strength has been
somehow allowed to evaporate in the boiling. And yet there
are so many good things in it, that the trifle, which is given at
an hour to suit late diners, ought to draw, and dp good holiday
business even after holiday time. The quintette, in imitation of the
Christy style, announced as " Wash me early, Mother dear" is de-
servedly encored. The piece would still gain by excision; and
Your Representative would unhesitatingly excide the "Not Worth
a Damsel's Smile" refrain, and also the first line of Robinson
Crusoe's first song. To his second song (where he pretends to be
prompted by the parrot) I say reform it altogether. In this piece,
MB. CKELLIN'S imitations of popular actors—of WEBSTER, BUCK-
STONK, of IRVING as Charles the First, and in The Sells, of TOOLE
and J. CLARKE (of the Adelphi). are very clever, especially those of
MESSRS. CLARKE and TOOLE, which were immediately recognised,
and acknowledged with a tribute of genuine applause. Mimicry is
a dangerous power for an actor to possess, but GARBICK was -an
exquisite mimic.
To say that in this lightest of light pieces there are about thirty
or forty charming young ladies, and that among them are Miss
ROSE CULLEN, Miss EMMA CHAMBERS (who used to be "such an
admiral" in the St. James's burlesque of Poll and Partner Joe),
Miss BBABANT, and others of often-photographed beauty, and to
add to this, that the theatre is in every respect the most elegantly
decorated, and one of the most luxuriously comfortable of all our
smaller theatres, is but to do justice to MB. ALFRED THOMPSON'S
taste and talent, and to the discernment and liberality of the present
Manageress, Miss ADA CAVENDISH, to whom for myself and as Your
Representative, I offer my best wishes for a happy new year, and
many of them.
I have finished my present week's Theatrocinium, or review of
Theatres; and so, Sir, being somewhat tired, I,
"With a yawn
Of Bheer fatigue, subsiding to repoee,"
lay down my pen, recline in my arm-ohair, light The Fragrant
Soother, open my Middlemarch, and cease, pro. tern., to be
YOCB REPRESENTATIVE.

MB. PUNCH is glad to see that one of the Railways, at least, is

SIB ABTHUB HELPS is very cruel. He has been savin; that if a
superior being were to ask him whether he would rid the world of
Inaccuracy or of Lying, he would say, " Let us get rid of Inaccu-
racy." Now SIR AKTHTJU goes into and adorns not only high, but
good sooiety/snd we ask him, plaintively, what Society, which loves
him, has done to hi™ that he would reduce it to the dead level of
accuracy in its speech. We don't lie. exactly, and when True
THOMAS wanted to decline the tongue that could not lie because it
would unfit him for ladies] society, he was a rude old THOMAS. But
all the charm of conversation would vanish if Imagination did not
wait on Assertion, and Ignorance on both, and Cheek on all three.
The most frightful story in our whole literature is that of the
Accurate ChM and the Astounded Visitor (MB. BARLOW may know
it) wherein is truth, and the infant, aged seven, was COLERIDGE'S.
"My Papa has left the house, seven, or perhaps nine minutes, and
he stated that he was going to call on our friend, MR. JOKES.
Unless he have varied his intention, you will, by following him, find
him at MR. JONES'S house. I cannot precisely inform you of the
number, but as there are only two houses in the terrace, if you fail
to detect him on inquiring at one, you will certainly discover him on
application at the other. "SIB AUTHUK, your slave,", as BEAN
SWIFT says, hut please let us talk as inaccurately as we like. It
will be all the same one hundred, or gay for most of us, forty years
hence.
Heterodox Intelligence.
SOME French papers have announced the death of M. FELIX
AKCHUIEDK FOUCHET, describing him as " the celebrated writer on
spontaneous generation." This, says the Pall Mall Gazette, is not
so. "His son, GEORGES POUCH ET, now about thirty-five, was the
author of Heterogenesis." This statement has greatly puzzled
"Ignoramus," who writes to say that he should have thought that
Heterogenetis had been written by BISHOP COLENSO.
NOTE FROM LORD BYRON.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
Mr line, "Thou dashest him," &o., seems, like Charles
Surface, to give a great many worthy men cause for uneasiness.
One of them suggests that it ended, "There let him Pray." Sir, if
I had used that word seriously, I should have been a hypocrite, and
if ironically, it would have been vulgar profanity in presence of the
awful Ocean. What I wrote was
"There let him Bray."
I wonder that this did not, for various reasons, occur to my
"amender." Yours truly,
Elysium. THE GHOST OF BYRON.
Funny.
WHO will explain this paragraph ?—
"HOKG KONG, DBC. 31.
"MB. WAT.E has reprimanded the British Consul at Ningpo, who, with
his American colleague, had brought the disturbance at Hangohow to an end.
Toe American Minister has thanked tbe latter gentleman."
A British Consul and an American join to put down a disturbance,
and put it down. The British Consul gets reprimanded by his
Minister; the American Consul gets thanked by his.
Which course is likeliest, " Encourager let autres,"—and in which
direction,—to put down disturbances, or to stand by and let them
blaze?
TOUJOUBS HAMAN. •
THERE was a pertain King, when, according to the venerable jest,
the Jews were like old Stilton (for they grew mitier and mitier in
the days of Moredecay) and this King waxed very angry at hearing
so much about one II A -MAN. We sympathise with that King, and
pray our kind contemporaries to consider our feelings.

SCHOOL.
(To be sung during the rtmainder of the holidays.)
UNLESS for a spooney, a dunce, and a fool,
Howe'er we may grumble, there's no place like School.
The games and the larks that a fellow has there,
Through all the vacation are wanting elsewhere.
School, School, sweet, sweet School!
Wherever I wander, there's no place like School.
In study and learning I take such delight—
Could always be at it from morning to night:
Though holiday tasks to perform 'tis my rule,
For downright hard " swotting" there's no place like School.
School, School, sweet, sweet School!
For downright hard'' swotting" there's no place like Sohool.
Festive Fancies.
THE elegance and taste conspicuous in the decorations which the
raw materials of Christmas fare were this year as usual embellished
withal, must have commanded the admiration of all observers. But
another time, perhaps, the Grocers will give their Australian meat
tins their merit-ornaments of gay rosettes. The turkeys, trimmed
with bows of pink and azure, looked, as young ladies generally
remarked, "sweetly pretty." It is said that an eccentric poulterer
once, when a public mourning occurred about Christmas time,
decked out his turkeys with black ribbon.

DARWIN'S MYSTERY OF MUSIC.
MR. PUNCH,
WHEN next yon see the illustrious author of The Expression
of the Emotiont in Men and Animals, will you, if yon please, ask
that distinguished Naturalist if he himself has ever, in his own
person, experienced
a certain sensation
which he offers to
explain, namely,
"the thrillor.slight
shiver which runs
down the backbone
and limbs of many
persons when they
are powerfully af-
fected by music."
The persons wont
to experience that
sensation, and ac-
quainted with the
Darwinian | hypo-
thesis of Man's ;pe-
digree, are, some of
them, curious to
learn whether its
E rejector is, as to
is musical sensi-
bilities, one of
themselves.
Perhaps, Sir, yon
would therefore
have the kindness
to ascertain for us
if the thrilling
effect of music,
which MB. DABWTN
refers to, is a fact of
his own conscious-
ness, or one which
he has only been
informed of by
others. Few, per-
haps, if any of those
others, are fully
prepared to accept
the theory suggested
by him to account
for this'mysterious
feeling in the
observation that
"music has a won-
derful power of re-
calling, ;in a vague
and indefinite man-
ner, those strong
emotions which
were felt during
long past ages,
when, as is prob-
able, our early pro-
genitors courted
each other by the
aid of vocal tones."
If any tenth is
embodied in this
suggestion, would
not every one sus-
ceptible of musical
influence have al-
ways found the most
powerfully thrilling
music to be that of
love-operas like the
Niinnnmliittii, and
the other chief
works of modern
Italian composers,
such as BELLINI
and DONIZETTI?
Eh, Mr. Punch?
Would not the frame of such an one be made to thrill, and
his flesh to creep, by those saccharine strains rather than by the
choruses of Israel in Egypt, the Dead March in Saul, the funereal
movement in BEETHOVEN'S Sinfonia Eroica, the supernatural
suggestions in MOZABT'S Requiem, and the weird harmonies and
"A CONTINTED MIND."

discords of Der Freisehiitz f Would not La ci darem, Satti, batti,
and_ Vedrai carino in Don Giovanni, for example, usually thrill the
sensitive hearer very much rather than he is thrilled by the
tremendous opening of the overture of that Opera, and the awful
music announcing the Statue? If the thrill struck by music be
traceable to an amatory origin, would not My Pretty Jane be
a piece of music
considerably more
thrilling than King
Death t
If. on the other
hand, music of the
grim and unearthly,
or the holy and
heavenly, sort, is
that which gene-
rally proves the
most thrilling, and
MR. DABWIN'S spe-
culation as to the
origin of the vibra-
tions imparted by
music to us is sound,
then must the sub-
limest effects in
the compositions of
SEBASTIAN BACH,
HANDEL, MOZAKT.
BEETHOVEN, and
WEBEB, be musical
developments of the
squeaks, squalls, and
grunts, and growls,
in which our an-
cestral apes, or
other brutes, used
to woo, instead of
expressing them-
selves in "vocal
tones" of a quality
softer, and "more
condoling," as Bot-
tom hath it.
To the majority
of persons endowed
with an ear through
which it is possible
for music to touch
their higher senti-
ments, do you think,
Sir, that ME. DAR-
WIN'S conjecture as-
to the cause of its
operation through
the human mind on
the human body,
will indicate that
he himself has any
the least proportion
of "music in his
soul"? Don't you
fancy that, in their
eyes, it will rather
betray an entire in-
ability to discern
any difference in
import, if in tune,
between Dr. Mar-
tin Luther's Hymn
and Alice Gray?
Should you not,
yourself, indeed,
be very much sur-
prised to hear that
our great Genealo-
gist was capable of
distinguishing the
National Anthem
from The Devil
among the Tailors?
As a matter of f aet,
MR. DARWIN may be an excellent amateur performer on the violin,
and as good a musician, as well as tiddler, as HERB JOACHIM.
In that case, his way of accounting for the mystery of music can
only be regarded as the crotchet of a musical genius to account for
a quaver. Your Servant, Sir, ADAGIO.

INSISTING on the propriety of putting ferocious murderers to death
rather than going to the expense of keeping them in prison. "R.,"
the writer of a letter, on "The Sacredness of Human Life, in the

would combine economy with gentleness:—
"If we are too squeamish to hang, let prussie acid or chloroform be called
in aid until such time as we shall discover the blessed secret whereby we may
instantly ' veil' such people out of the world."
Certainly, it may be said that in cases, wherein the reformation of
criminals is hopeless, the cheapest and best way next to it with
them would be their chloroformation. For the halter, chloroform,
as Humanity must allow, and the lower orders of East London
generally may be conceived to say, would be a good halter.native.

WONDROUS BEER.
Brrnro from Paris,
the Correspondent
of a readable con-
temporary states
that:—
"A good deal of
controversy has been
going on respecting
the water of Lourdee.
A common marchand
de liqueur* attempted
to sell it in bottles
with his other wares,
whereupon the BISHOP
OP TABBES interfered,
and condemned the
publican in a pasto-
ral."
Foolish Bong!
Why did he incur
episcopal censure,
liy the opr-n sale of
spiritual in common
with spirituous
liquor? He might
have sold it under
a disguise with im-
punity, at a great
profit. He might
have used it to
water his brandy
with. Or, if scru-
pulous, he might have disposed of his Lourdes water in a genuine way, through brewing beer with it.
If it contains anything medicinal, it would then perhaps, more or less, have approached to the quality

of Stogumber ale. No reasonable
person can doubt that any miraculous
Eroperties it may possess it would
ave exerted, with at least undi-
minished strength, in the form of
malt liquor. Miraculous water
would perhaps have been found to
make miraculous _beer. Ale made of
Lourdes water might have proved to
be a beer that nobody ever got the
worse for by drinking, but everyone
always the better, and the brewer
and vendor of it might have made
his fortune by supplying the public
with the desideratum of beer which,
whilst remarkable for its cordial
effect, was not an intoxicating fluid.
Denied.
A SCIENTIFIC Musician, named
SIDLET TAYLOR, A.M., who is quoted
by our dear and disportive old
friend, the Musical World, has laid
down some "Acoustical proposi-
tions." "We have no doubt of his
learning, but we utterly deny his
very first allegation. He says:—
"Sound can pass through solid, liquid,
and gaseous bodies, but not through a
vacuum."
We have, unhappily, heard too
many delightful songs delivered by
men and women with perfectly
empty heads, to admit this for one
moment.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
He addresses the Editor concerning the Renovations in the Spectacle at
Covent Garden, the Grecian Pantomime, and that at the Crystal
Palace.
TUBED more Christmas pieces. At Covent Garden Babil 'and Byott
has been renovated. It scarcely wanted it, as the main-" Spring
Chorus " of the piece was as good as ever. In this wretched weather
I am personally obliged to ME. RIVIERE for having put Spring,
Spring, Gentle Spring, into the mouths of all the errand-boys,
walking butchers, pedestrian bakers, tinkers, tailors, whistling
sailors, and all such as have time for a tune, while trudging through
the dirty streets, and o'er the flooded gutters. "Spring, Spring,
gentle Spring!" that's all I know of it, and I come to grief in the
second line. I have met a parrot and a bullfinch that do precisely
the same thing. My friends stop me when I begin, or exeunt,
frowning. I hope to have the first eight bars of the air perfect by
the time I coll upon You, Sir, in your study; but, as Your Represen-
tative, I am not a good hand, or, I should say, ear, at catching
anything. Vaccinate me, however, with a taking tune, such as this
present popular melody, and I'm a pleasant companion. Now
then, what s the next article?
As for the novelties in the ballet department, there is M.
ESPIWOSA, who makes quite a Tee-to-tum of himself as a Dancing
Dervish, and MADAME ESPLNOSA, with some dancing ladies, as
"Tartares." Good name for a ballet, by the way, The Teetotum
and the Fair Tartar. But quite alone comes HENBIETTJS u'Ou, the
most graceful, the most refined danseuse since the days of lengthy
book-muslin skirts. Even when she is representing a Bacchante,
there is nothing sensual or gross in her impersonation. Hers is not
the dance in which wild orgies culminate, but it is that of the
Priestess of Bacchus rejoicing in the gift of the Vine to men. Were
all descriptive dancing like this of 11 KN HII.T n, n'()it, the Golden Age
of the ballet would have returned. The special artist, M. COLLODION,
is clever, but he only executes two caricatures, and before he begins
he writes above them for whom they are intended, which is com-
plimentary neither to his own talent nor to the intelligence of the
public. Miss BABRY does more than look the Amazonian Prince
Fortinbratse; she acts it. Many of the dresses and some of the
music is new, and, taken altogether, the brilliant spectacle of Babil
and Bijou is, as yet, unsurpassed by anything of the kind in London,
or out of it.
True to my Christmas duties, I represented You, Sir, at the
Grecian, and wondered much at the Speaking Head of Mr. Nobody,
which walks and talks (bother CHABLES TEE FIRST, he's always
cropping up now-a-days I) in the second scene of Nix, which is the
name of the Pantomime. This is the novel feature of the perform-
ance, as the CONQUESTS, pere et flh, do as many astounding jumps,
hops, skips, and tumbles as of old, and in the Incantation Scene a
LuLU-like bound is repeated every two minutes. The perpetual
question is, " Where are they now r" And the answer comes, "All
over the place." So the spScialitS of the Grecian is as heretofore, and
the theatre is so densely crowded that on Saturday nights the people
walk on one another's heads, until they drop in somewhere, when
they sit how they can, and see as much as they can with half an eye;
for in these compact bodies you may be firmly wedged in sideways,
and unable to use more than one eye, and that only with a dangerous
wrench. West-end Managers have sung in their Eastern brother's
ear, "To the West, to the West! "but the Bounding Brother of the
Eastern Boundary does not, very wisely, care to give up the trapezes
on which he has to fiy, for others which he knows not of.
After all, Sir, the holiday place for the million is Mister Crystal
Palace. Better than the Theatres, because, including a theatrical
entertainment, it gives you and yours—"and yours" being in the
Christmas holidays the important point—a first-rate Pantomime,
full of funny business worked into, and got out of, a story that all
know something about, though for detail they must consult the
C. P. Pantomime, namely, Jack and Jill. Then there is a trans-
formation scene, which is probably unequalled in London at the
present time, which is saying a good deal, but not too much. The
Arabs, too, have left their tribes and tents in the desert for
London lodgings and tent bedsteads, in order to show an apprecia-
tive public at the Crystal Palace what are their habits and manners
when at home on their own native sand. They pile themselves one
on the top of the other as if the highest up aloft was going to inspect
the roof of the Crystal Palace, to see if any repairs might be neces-
sary. Fingers were made before forks, and lads before ladders; the
use of which is entirely superseded by these Beni Zoug-Zoug Arabs,
who, without any mechanical appliance, could send one of their
young men, or even their " Venerable Chief " himself, mounted on
the shoulders of several other Beni Zoug-Zougs, up to the attic
window of a Belgravian mansion. Your Representative, Sir, hit at
once, when he saw the performance of the Zoug-Zougs, on the
enormous trade which the Oriental Forty Thieves must have driven
in housebreaking. Nothing more simple. The celebrated troupe of
Forty (always under the guidance of their "Venerable Chief")
enter the streets of Bagdad, for example: they make their ladder
of men, the fortieth steps from the thirty-ninth's shoulders on to
the roof of CALIPH HABOUN'S palace, and through the trap-door he
descends into the sumptuous rooms below. The thirty-nine in the
street attract the attention of the household by their performances
until Number Forty has finished his little business, when up goes
the human ladder again, down comes the fortieth thief with his
pockets full, when, breaking the ladder up into its living compo-
nent parts, away they scamper to the trackless desert. They are

marvellous fellows. It would be a bad speculation on the part of
the College of Surgeons to pay them BO much down to insure the
possession of their skeletons infuturo. Why, they haven't got any
bones, or, if they have, they must be supple as whalebone. Then
after this sight there's the Aquarium. To see the Crabs in solemn
conclave, like a party of old fogies, who know each other's stories by
heart, seated round a table on a Club-night, is in itself as refreshing
as a good scene in a comedy. Then to see King Octopus is a panto-
mime, with Cod for Clown, Shrimps for Sprites, and Mackerel for the
Silver Fairies; and there's Captain Cuttle (of whom, when found,
make a note), to serve as a farce to wind up the entertainment.

like to be represented in the Diving Bell, I think I 've given a report
of things specially Christmassy, and have directed the attention of

WOMAN AT THE WHEEL.
HE Pall 1 Matt Gazette
points out that Tuesday
last week, the 7th of
January, was what used
to be called " St. Distaff's
Day," when "our ances-
tresses were in the habit
of resuming their spin-
ning operations after the
Christmas holidays." Our
judicious contemporary,
having truly remarked
that" the distaff, spindle,
and spinning-wheel have
long since disappeared,
and woman is engaged in
far more sublime occupa-
tions than spinning flax,"
suggests, with manifest
reason, in so far as the
strong-minded deolaimers
of the female platform
are concerned, that the
practice of spinning
might be advantageously
resumed. In spinning,
however, Woman would,
now-a-days, be opposed
by a competitor that
would render it] | un-
profitable. Steam has
superseded Woman. The
spinster would find herself cut out by the spinning-jenny. But what
then? St. Distaff's cultus might very well be revived, mutatis mu-
tandis. The Sewing-Machine, among the wiser sort of women, has
replaced the distaff. The 7th of January might-in future, be observed
as the day of St. Sewing Machine, or St. Ehas Howe's Day, in honour
of that engine's inventor and the United States. Or the day might
be dedicated to one of its improvements, or improvers; St. Agenoria.
St. Singer, or St. Wanzer the Less. If strong-minded women would
transfer their feet from the stump to the sewing-machine, they
would turn them from the error of their ways, and at the same time
employ their hands in occupation exclusive of the misemployment
which is ant to be found, for hands otherwise unoccupied, by some-
body mentioned in a poem by DE. WATTS.
Speculation and Sanskrit.
THE new translation of an ancient work which PBOFESSOB MAX

EX-EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH.
BORN AT THE TUILERIES. APRIL 20, 1808. DIED AT CHISLEHURST,
JANUARY 9, 1878.
"THE EMPEEOE died this morning—half-past ten."
So runs the tidings, writ-up, short and round,
On mud-splashed windows of each dusty den,
Where, daily, the day's news takes shape and sound.
And the unresting tide of life, that flows
Through London's arteries, 'twixt heart and brain,
Stays to take in, then on its errand goes,
Nor settles, straight, to even poise again.
News, this, of the deep voice that speaka to all,—
Lightest of heart or gravest—those who care,
And know least of the world's dice as they fall,
Or, keenest, back the game, or, deepest, share.
News, whose dull fall through Time's dark pool will urge
The pukes of an ever-widening ring,
That cease not, till they touch the farthest verge
Reached by man's message on the lightning's wing.
It was no common life that so could fill
The thought of Europe: 'tis no common death,
Kings, Statesmen, Nations, with such shock to thrill,
As rarely greets surcease of exile's breath.
Already scores of ready penmen draft
Of his life's course to power their bird's-eye view,
Through poverty, and perjury, and craft,
And redder stains that the blurred track imbrue.
Let whoso will count of his faults the cost,
And point a moral in his saddened end;
This is the thought in England uppermost—
He, who has died among us, lived our friend.
If sinners may by suffering, too, be shriven,
What penance those last years had to sustain!
The sting of fall and failure deeper driven
By the dull stroke of slow and sleepless pain.
Who that has judged him harshliest but has found
Comfort in thinking love was there to tend
The exile's eve, and cheer home's narrow bound-
That wife and son were with him to the end.
The time to weigh him fairly is not now;
Nor are the true weights any France can bring:
That sprang to fix the crown upon his brow,
And her own neck beneath his feet to fling.
Heavily both have answered for their sin:
Nor did the EMPEEOB heavier fall undo,
Than France, that backed him still while he could win,
Nor turned against him till the luok turned too.
But now 'tis England, and not France, that stands
Silent beside an exile's dying bed,
Mindful of kindness rendered by his hands,
Sorrowing with those that sorrow for the dead.

example, at the Druids' Dinner, the other day, in discussing the
impost by which the incomes of a part of the people are taxed to pay
the expenses of the whole, insteaa of attempting to defend confisca-
tion with sophistry, and to stifle complaint with sneers, he condemned
the false and dishonest apology, alleged by financial swindlers'
advocates on behalf of the Income-tax, that it weighs only on the
rich who are well able to pay it, and he maintained that, on the
contrary, it falls " with the greatest severity on the poorest of all
the classes of the community—that which, upon limited means and
small profits, has to keep up a state of respectability." The lie
which MB. VKBNOH HABCOUBT refuted is one of those lies which
Statesmen are very apt to tell in talking to simpletons; lies coupled
with truths, from which the generality of people at public meetings
have not sense enough to disentangle them. It is quite true that
the rich are well able to pay the Income-tax; but to say that the
Income-tax weighs only on them is telling a falsehood which tran-
scends common lying. The rich, as a rule, can afford to live up to
their incomes, and it matters nothing to wealthy people whether
their incomes are taxed, or duties are imposed upon the luxuries on
which they expend them. The class rightly described by MB. HAB-
COTJBT as the poorest of the country, consists of persons under the
necessity of living as much within their incomes as possible. They
need to make all the provision that ever they can against ruin con-
stantly staring them in the face. The Income-tax, substituted for
indirect taxation, wrings from them the savings they ought to put
by, and, by way of compensation, offers them the advantage of buy-
ing cheapened superfluities, which, how cheap soever, are too dear
for them at any price. Thus are their slender incomes in large
measure confiscated by the CMANCKI.LOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, and
amends are made them with facilities to squander the rest.
WISDOM ON THE WEATHER.
CLEABLT, certain proverbs should be altered according to the
weather. This may seem at first a startling proposition, but con-
sider it a moment and you will see there is some sense in it. Look,
for instance, at the proverb, "There is nothing new under the sun."
Sorely, in weather like the present, when the sun is never seen,
nobody would dream of using such a proverb. In order to be appli-
cable to this damp and dismal time, it should be altered to " There's
nothing new under one's umbrella." Or take the common saying
that " Every man should lay by something for a rainy day." In
weather like the present, when the days are always rainy, a proverb
such as this becomes exceedingly perplexing. In tine weather a
man may fitly lay by something; say, for instance, his umbrella.
But in days of constant deluge he cannot well do this, without the
certainty, at any rate, of getting a good ducking. The only proverb
wholly suited to the weather of this winter is the saying that "It
never rains but it pours:" the truth whereof, for .the last four
months, has been copiously manifest.
Our Concession to Rome.
"His Holiness has lately delivered an address in which he compared him-
self to TOBIT."—Roman Newi.
'DEAB Father, we love you. but surely 'twas no bit
Of luck, that suggestion of likeness to TOBIT:
By miracle TOBIT grew blind to the light;
You claim to possess a miraculous sight.
Bat one thing we hasten to grant, nothing loth,
The stories, dear Pcre, are Apocryphal—both.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HAPPY THOUGHTS.
Return of my Aunt—The Nook after the late Sains—A Surprise-
The End in View.

HEK I see the front garden from over the gate
I hardly know The Nook again. It is as
much changed for the better as a slovenly
man who has had his hair cut.
My Aunt has arrived. She has been Oanlavised for the Neu-
ralgia, and is quite well again; which, however, she says, she has
no doubt would have been lie result if she 'd undergone the treat
samement at home. She is at first a little annoyed with me about
the GLY.M I'MYNS, because she had predetermined a match; and,
secondly, she is astonished at my not having met her at the Station.
These matters are, subsequently, duly explained.
Little Uncles JACK ana GILL are also here. When'we appear at
the_ frent gate, they are playing at horses on the gravel-path,
which seems to be, I point out to ENGLBMOBE.'nicely dry in spite of
the rain. They are affectionate children. On seeing me, they run
away, crying. "They think you 're ' Bogie," " ENGLEMOBE remarks.
They 've gone indoors to summon my Aunt.
The old woman left in charge of the house comes to the front
door. She recognises me. and sniffs. She prepares for my reception
by giving her face a rub round with the corner of her apron, and
then she opens the gate, stands behind it nervously, and curtseys.
"MBS. I'. WOK in?" I ask. It may be remembered, but it pro-
bably is not, that my Aunt's name is BASCOE.
"Yes, Sir," says the old woman. "The lady come as the day
bef are yezzerdy. She ain't been altogether well since comin', she
ain't. "Werry damp it is for them as ain't used to't."
"Damp I"
"_Tour name must be Mister Drainage," says ENGLEMOKE, sur-
veying the lawn. "The ground here 'g like a greasy sponge. Not
nioe-Cplonel Greasy Sponge, eh?"
"What's to be done?" I ask, for I see that the cottage is in a
similar position to what the Ark must have been in after the first
half-inch of waters had subsided.
"When I came," says my Aunt, after the first salutations and
congratulations are over, "yon had to walk through one big puddle
to the front door, and you couldn't put your foot out of the French
windows"
"Without putting your foot in it." suggests ENOLEMOBE.
My Aunt nods, and. continues—'1 The revandah was a perfectly
swopelets homp."
"Sammy Swamp," says ENGLEMOBE, translating the phrase in his
own fashion. "Your Aunt's right. Look at it now."
I do look at it, and in another second it occurs to me that the
Masons and Builders left here some time since to put everything in
order, have achieved a triumph of constructive skill by sloping the
pavement of the verandah from the garden dmcn to the house!!
"Mister Cellar below, eh ?" asks ENGLEMOBE.
"Yes, but nothing in it."
"Plenty of water by now. Little Tommy Temperature increases;
William Water ditto. Steam up. General Damp—everywhere.
No dry goods store." He shakes his head ruefully. My Aunt puts
her hand to her side, in anticipation of rheumatic effects.
I turn to him and on him, rather savagely, " Hang it, ENGLEMOBE,
you recommended the place. You said 'Nook'"
"And; you Nooked. Good boy. But your little ENGLEMOBE
didn't know about Colonel Clay-soil, and he didn't give orders to
Mister Builder."
I admit this. I remark that the garden, considering all things,
looks promising.
He cheers me up on this score. "Very promising. It '11 be
Little All-right if you give it time. Builder must put this square,
or no £ s. d. Touch up the cellars. Dry your eyes. Ring up
again,'and go on with the next performance."
He is right. If drained properly, and so forth, I am sure there
can't be a nealthier spot than The Nook.
"The bloom is on the rye as far as the children go," says
ENGLEMOBE.
My Aunt replies, "Yes, I 'm glad to see them with such cheesy
rokes."
We are recovering our good-humour.
Happy Thought.—Make the best of a good job; for it is a good
job done, excepting the builder, who must have been a perfect fool.
Talking of perfect fools, how's my new Gardener getting on? "Not
that he's a perfect fool," I say pleasantly, smiling: "on the con-
trary, he appeared to be a very intelligent-—"
"Did he?" my Aunt says, dubiously. "Well, I can't make him
out myself. Nor any one else, I should say. He's got odd ways of
going on."
Happy Thought.—Perhaps he has begun his " fancy gardening,"
and my Aunt doesn't understand it.
"At times,—I don't wish to frighten you, or myself, or any-
body," she says, with great consideration, whereat ENGLEMOBE nods
approvingly,—" but at times I think he's queer."
"At odd times," suggests ENGLEMOKB.
But as my Aunt looks uncommonly serious, ENGLEXOBE frowns
at me, as if I'd made an inopportune joke.
"(iueer?" I repeat, and look at ENGLEMOKE, who, unseen by
my Aunt, goes through a pantomimic performance of lifting up
his hand to his mouth, pretending to take a draught, and then
touching his forehead significantly.
"You mean that he drinks?" I say to ENGLEMOBE.
"Liquor's his name, probably," he returns.
"He frightened that old rag-doll of a woman whom you 've put
to keep house here," my Aunt continues; "and, though I don't
understand much about gardening myself, yet it doesn't seem to me
that he's going on right?"
The Rag-Doll meets us in the passage, and corroborates this state-
ment. "Nuffin ain't been right since he come, and.GurcH's men
left. I railly don't think as he "s safe with a pick, or a 'oe, and
childern about."
I inquire as to his habits. She has seen hi™ at meals.
"No, Sir, he don't drink, leastways not nutiin to speak on, but
he's strange. His second day here he dashed in among them salary
beds quite like a mad person.'
"Good gracious! I hope he's not a luniao!" my Aunt exclaims.
"I ain't not so sure o' that, Mum," says the Rag-Doll, sniffing
and retiring, first behind her apron, which she holds up to her face,
and sniffs over its corner at us; then, under that cover, she backs
down the passage, and goes sideways into the kitchen.
All my Gardener's information concerning the MIKADO, Japanese
Gardening, and the DTTKE OF SHETLAND, flashes across me. I do not
feel comfortable as I enter the Kitchen Garden.
"Hallo!" exclaims ENGLEMOKE; and we all three stand in utter
amazement at the scene before us.
Happy Thought.—Fancy Gardening certainly.
One part of the place looks as if it had been devastated by
a fearful storm, while another seems to have suffered from some
eccentric convulsion of nature, which has sent the roots up in
the air and fixed the tops downwards in the earth. This is the
case with the cabbages. The new currant-bashes are tied on to
the tops of the highest trees, looking very like those Dutch brooms
which a landsman often notices with wonder at the mast-heads of
fishing smacks. The celery beds are completely dug up, looking
like a troubled sea in dirty weather, with the exception of one small
pateh in the centre, where we observe a stone jar standing, labelled
legibly Mixed Pickles. Garden tools, all brand new, which he has
bought on his own account, are, we see, planted out in a row, like
young trees, and caref uUy propped up. An empty milk-pail is by
the strawberry-beds, which have been filled with young plants. At
the end of the garden, by_ the wall, we now catch sight of a smoking
bonfire, which is just beginning to blaze. The Fancy Gardener is at
present invisible.
"Mad as a hatter!" ENGLEMOBE says, emphatically.
Evidently. But what an awful state of things.
We walk down the Kitchen Garden path in some trepidation. A
mad Gardener might be waiting behind a bush, or a hedge, with
some instrument, and jump out suddenly Ah! there he is.

HOWL OF FRANTIC DELIGHT
INDULGED IN BY MR. PUNCH ON ONE DAY, LAST WEEK, BEHOLDING HIS SHADOW.
BIELA BROUGHT TO BOOK.
THAT erratic Biela Comet,
Which we thought had gone to smash,
Blundering against our planet
In collision rude and rash,
And scattering tail and kernel,
In windy meteor-flare,
Had vanishod from the star-field,
Like a burst-up millionnaire—
Like that millionnaire returning
To the world of bourse and bill,
In the Eastern blue is burning
(See KLIXK KuruKS) still!
There, a beggar upon horseback,
Over the Indian tides,
Reckless of all he's gone through,
Biela the Centaur rides'.
And like that millionnaire, too,
Whose one faith 'a gain for loss,
He rides upon a Centaur,*
Whose hoof is on the Cross. _
Thus one dull December morning,
In a fleeting break of blue,
The telescope of POGSOW t
Nailed Biela—the old do!
* The Centaur rises junt above the Southern Cross.
f The distinguished Madras Government Astronomer.
He was no easy capture—
Two mornings had gone by,
That I'OOSON'S watchful weapon
In vain had swept the sky;
When, on the third, the Centaur
Trotting into the field,
With Biela " up" upon him,
His whereabouts revealed.
There through the southern star-sphere
The erratic comet jogs on,
.Nor deems that for four minutes
He's within the gaze of Poososr,
Whose sharp eye thus reports him—
"Looks round and fat and bright—
At least about the nucleus—
But hag no tail in sight."
I read, and for a moment
Some pity crossed my mind—
"Poor Biela! been in Queer Street;
Had to leave his tail behind!
'Twas, p'raps, when last November
He was missing from our skies,
And with those meteor-fireworks
Threw star-dust in our eyes.
"Yes, for those very meteors
Poor Biela, I '11 go bail,
Was forced to raise the needful,
By pledging his own tail,
Or on that tail's been living,
In this ecliptic pause,
As bears they say, in winter,
Keep fat on their own paws'"
So pitiful my fancy,
Over poor Biela grew—
The single tail-less comet,
Bare-burning on the blue!
And I thought, " Will't be a lesson
To young comets hot and rash,
Not to get across our orbit,
And, like Biela, come to smash?"
But lo, the following morning
From POGSON tidings brought,
By clearer observation
With brighter aspect fraught:
"The nucleus enlarging
To twice its former scale;
And, visible appendage,
A faint, but growing tail!"
Sly rogue! 'Tis the old story,
In star-sphere, bourse, or mart,
Still these erratic blazers
But smash again to start:
Whatever means they squander,
Whatever trains they spill,
When they turn up, 'tis always
With a new tail growing still!
WHO WANTS A DIPLOMA?
THE following notice, with address at top, and name
at foot, has been sent to Mr. Punch .—
"Dear Sir,—From information I have obtained, I wish to
inform you I can now assist you in obtaining the title of
Doctor; the LI..D. degree from an American University can be
obtained in 'absentia.' This degree can be affixed after your
name in the Medical Directories, while the other Foreign diplo-
mas are not admitted. My fee is Twenty Guineas. I am, Sir,
yours faithfully, &c., &c., &c."
Punch is exceedingly obliged, but when he wants to
throw away twenty guineas, he gives them to Mrs.
Punch for a new dress. Neztly, when he wants a
degree, he confers it on himself, because that is just as
honourable a course as buying a diploma, and quite as
useful. Lastly, he does not wish to see himself in any
Medical Directory, even though his name would stand
there with the names of numbers of men whom he is
proud to call his friends, and who owe none of their
hard-earned titles to humbug and quackery like that
suggested in the above note. He withholds the name
only because he does not desire to advertise the person.

This plain Cook is certainly plain spoken, but she

upon a Barber as a tradesman, or would she "not
object" to cook a dinner for a Chimney-sweep? The
perambulant purveyor of feline provision may call him-
self a tradesman, for aught that we can tell, and so too
may a merchant who traffics in discarded habiliments
and venerable hats. Haply one of these fine days (if we

BENTLEYS AND POfiSONS.
MR. PUNCH has much pleasure in laying before his readers some
conjectural emendations, by critics whose sagacity bespeaks itself,
of certain passages in a sweet little poem, the composition of an
anonymous bard, adapted to the youngest capacity, and designed to
awaken the affectionate playfulness 01very early childhood. These
splendid exercises of the critical faculty are contained in the follow-
ing letters, addressed
To the Editor of Punch.
SIB,—Allow me to venture on the suggestion of what I take to be
the correct reading of two lines in a well-known and favourite
nursery rhyme, which, as contained in the common editions of books
of such poetry, stand thus :—
Dancy baby diddy.
What shall I do widdy >
These verses, though not absolutely unintelligible, are seriously
vitiated by a proportion of absolute nonsense which cannot be re-
garded as wholesome nutriment for the tender mental faculties of
infancy. "Dancy " is a corruption of a W9rd which has an obvious
meaning, and •by some minds a signification may be attached to
"widdy;" but "diddy" can hardly convey a definite meaning to
any ordinary intellect. I propose that the fines above cited should
be read as follows :—
Dansez, baby, Biddy.
What shall I do wid 'ee?
The supposition that the rhymes whence the foregoing couplet is
quoted were originally composed in broken English by a French
6omi«, and subsequently varied by an Irish nursemaid, is quite a
sufficient warrant for their restoration as above, confidently proposed
by your constant reader, DUNSTAN
SIB,—I cannot for a moment entertain a conjecture which, under
pretence of amending a good old English nursery rhyme, would give
it a semi-foreign origin. To my mind there is no question that the
verses which a dunce has proposed to mar with outlandish corrup-
tions were originally these:—
Dance, a baby, did he:
What shall I do, Kiddy?
"Kid" is a synonym for infant or baby notoriously much in use
among the humbler classes, whence we all know that nurses are
generally selected. "Kiddy " is its appropriate diminutive.
I am, Sir, &c., EBWABDULTJS.
SIR,—1 cannot bring my mind to adopt any of the proposed new
readings of "Danoy baby." On my own, mind there is no doubt
whatever that the first two lines of that celebrated poem, correctly
rendered would be:—
Dance, my baby, did *oo?
What shall Ma do widow?
In this variation from the received text maternal prattle, you will
observe, is beautifully blended with conjugal solicitude.

RATHER HARD LINES.
THIS is an advertisement from an Irish paper. Please to read,
nevertheless:—
WANTED by a Gentleman board and schooling for a Boy, aged
thirteen years, of a bad turn of mind, and given to lying: intended
for the sea: terms from £16 to £18 per annum, payable monthly.
Address, £c.
\Vhat_ has the Sea done that so objectionable a youth" should be
thrown into it? Why insult respectable fishes? And, if he is to
be drowned, what is the use of wasting money on his board and
schooling? Bnt if by the Sea is meant the Service, the British
Marine is really much indebted to the advertiser. What we find
and love in that Service is, among many other excellent qualities,
a good turn of mind (whatever the "gentleman" means) and an
absolute hatred of lying. Lastly, we would remark that, however
desperately and outrageously wicked a boy of thirteen may be, his
faults are probably due to those who have brought him up badly,
and it is dealing a child rather hard measure to prejudice the mind
of any better tutors against him. However, 'tis an Irish advertise-
ment, and an " affectionate people " has its own ways.
Spiritualism and Shakspeare.
IN a letter to Prince Henry, the Divine WILLIAMS makes Faktaff
sign himself " JACK FALSTAFF, with my familiars." Some commen-
tators will hence, perhaps, infer that SHAKSPEABE was a Spiritualist.
A HOME QUESTION.
ARK Young Men who have sisters generally found to marry? One
would fancy they must know too much.
PAPAL PREVISION.
THE Roman Correspondent of the Times tells us that "the POPE
still speaks of the Italian Government as 'Sub-Alpine.'" What
first put this phrase to denote VICTOR-EMMANUEL and his Ministers
into the Holy Father's head? The Chief and the Members of the
Government which he calls Sub-Alpine are not, in any intelligible
sense, under the Alps. Certainly they have not, as yet, the Alps on
top of them. Maybe the POPE imagines that he foresees them lying
under the Alps, which have been hurled upon their heads for having
dethroned him. There, perhaps, they lie, to his mind's eye, like the
Titan beneath Etna. Thus we can imagine that, as persons destined
to be Cardinals by His Holiness are Cardinals already, so the Italian
King and his Councillors are already Sab- Alpine to the POPE in petto.
First News of the "Challenger."
[The Daily Telegraph's Correspondent on board states that the first dredging
has resulted in the discovery here immortalised.]

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
POETIC CLASSICS FOR PROSAIC READERS.

HBICE GBACIOUS MB. PUNCH,
IT seems to me that the now favourite
form of poetry might be used for the instruction
of the rising generation. I have, therefore, put
the list of the Roman. Kings into verse, and, if
this meets your approval, 1 will do all the Consols
of Borne, and then all the Lord Mayors of London.
Yours deferentially,
OBBILIUS FLAGELLATOB.
The first King of Rome was called ROMULUS.
His position was slightly anomalous,
Him we cannot esteem, as
He killed brother REMUS,
For reading him cynical homilies.
n.
The second was NUMA POMPILIUS.
His subjects were really so silly as
To believe he was taught
By a nymph whom he caught
In a grot. Let 'a be glad we know mi-Una.
m.
The third was named Trains HosTnjus.
It's uncertain of whom he was filius:
But certain his vows
Brought down fire on his house,
For his incense made Jupiter bilious.
IV.
The fourth he was called ANGUS MABTIUS,
Who was full of most laudable vartues;
His Majesty's action
Gave much satisfaction,
And he probably wore fine moustarohios.
V.
The fifth was TABQUINIUS and PBISCUS;
He was proud of his wife and his whiskers;
Two Princes he 'd chiselled
(When ANCUS had mizzled),
Took and broke his old head with a discus.
VI.
The sixth he was called SKBVIUS TULLIUS;
On reforms he could talk quite as dully as
Any TAYLOR, or ODOEB,
Or Democrat codger
Of that sort, who stands up to bul-ly us.
vn.
The Last was TABQUINIUS SUPEBBUS,
(His wife o'er her father drove her buss,) \
He turned out such a brute,
That Rome upped with her foot,
And—cried, "There! No more Kings shall disturb us."
THREATENED STRIKE OF CUSTOMERS.
BUTCHERS, our bucks. Grocers, our good Sirs. Purveyors of food
fa general, our pretty fellows. Observe that, on the afternoon of
Tuesday last week, a numerously attended meeting of the Members
of Club Committees and Members of Clubs was held at Willis's
Rooms for a purpose likely considerably to affect your interests. It
was no less than that of establishing a Club Co-operative Supply.
This purpose, gentlemen of the azure tunic and the white apron,
bids very fair indeed to be carried out. Resolutions were passed to
take decided steps to that end. A Club Co-operative Company has
been established. It means business. You will say it means mis-
chief. The National Club, the East India Club, the Army and
Navy Club, have put their shoulders to the wheel; and very soon
the rest of the Clubs will co-operate with them, shoulder to shoulder.
For why? Losses accrue to Clubs from paying high retail prices
for goods of low quality. The deficits in Club balance-sheets out of
the supply of provisions have become of serious consequence. Mem-
bers of Clubs cry out and complain that the prices at the Clubs are
higher in some respects than those at the restaurants, where the
proprietors have to pay all the expenses out of their business receipts,
having no annual subscriptions to rely upon for payment of their
rent and other outgoings. These facts were stated by the HOST. A.
B. HAMILTON to the Co-operative Clubs Meeting ex cathedrd; as
Chairman, you know. He pointed out that they necessitated com-
bination on the part of Clubs in order to secure the best articles of
provisions at moderate prices, instead of articles always high-priced,
and not always of the best. Accordingly it was unanimously re-
solved by the meeting—"That the directors" (of the Company
above-named) "be requested to communicate with various Club
Committees, with the view to secure their support and co-operation."
Friends, you see these are striking times. Co-operative Stores are
virtually Customers' Unions. In effect they constitute strikes of
Customers against Shopkeepers. The Civil Service has generally
struck against you. Now the strike is extending to the Clubs. A
general strike of Clubs will be a heavy blow indeed to you, and no
joke. Be wise in time. Follow the good example of COLONEL
CROCKETT'S 'Possum. Say to customers on the point of co-operating
against your extortion—" Don't strike, Gentlemen. We will come
down." And come down immediately. Then, although, for having
brought you to honest reason, we may say that Clubs are trumps,
the remark will not he added, on your loss of business, that you did
foolishly in playing the knave.
i WANTED.
"A COMPANION required by a Married Lady of position. She must be a
lady by birth. A Young Lady of a kind and affectionate disposition would
meet with real kindness and a pleasant happy home. She must understand
arranging hair with taste. No other duties.'
Is there not some mistake in the wording of this invitation, where
happiness and hair-dressing are so beautifully blended P The
advertisement states that the desired companion must be " a lady"
by birth, but as it is indispensable that she should understand
arranging hair, probably it ought to have said "a lady's maid."
The arrangement of the hair, with or without taste, has not hitherto
been included amongst the studies and accemplishments to which
attention is paid in girls' schools and colleges. But if it were
generally known that companionships to ladies "of position" could
be secured merely by the cultivation of such a simple talent as that
for "doing" hair, we should probably soon see the names of the
most eminent coiffeurs, the first artistes of their time en chevettx, if
not at the head, at least high up in those lists of professors of every
imaginable art and science, without which no Ladies' Establishment
has now any chance of success. Perhaps the " National Union for
improving the education of Women of all classes" will turn its
attention to this neglected branch of female instruction, and unsus-
pected source of lady-like emolument.

I 'H an Englishman, Londoner, Lodger,
There are thousands and thousands like me;
I 'm zealous for freedom as ODGER,
Claim Moral Self-Government free:
But I fret under petty restrictions—
Devices of pedagogue-rule—
Enforced under penal inflictions,
As though this great realm were a school.
I live like a hear in a cavern,
Wheneeforth for my victuals I roam:
I dine every day at a tavern,
For they can't cook my dinner at home.
On work-days I 'm free, but on Sunday
The serf s bitter portion is mine:
Between three and six on that one day,
A Statute forbids me to dine!
In an hour who can finish his dinner P
I smoke, and repose on my perch,
Past seven, when of old this poor sinner
Was wont to be going to church.
Sabbatarian Teetotallers' notion
A splendid success don't you think?
They 'ye taken a deal by their motion
To limit my freedom of drink.
A private house I rent a room in.
Instead, were my home an hotel,
The law me three long hours would doom in
Solitude every Sunday to dwell.
As a guest, of a huge fine in danger,
By my side any friend would remain.
A pedant's Act makes him a stranger;
Refreshment forbids to obtain.
Come quickly a blest Dissolution!
Then, Englishmen, rush to the poll;
And force, by your votes, restitution
Of rational folk's self-control.

Will yon crouch on, like milksops unmanned,

THE MILD SEASON.
THE unusually mild temperature of the present season (by courtesy
Winter) is beginning to produce a fiae crop of newspaper paragraphs,
and one reads and hears of nothing but precocious strawberries,
daring hyacinths, venturesome asparagus, and apple-trees prema-
turely bloomful. Industrious statisticians are looking up old
winters, and exploring remote countries and distant centuries for
exact parallels. _ Thermometers are glad to be in the shade. The
trade in skates is flat. Furs are entirely changing their nature, and
becoming a drug in the market, and alarming reports are flying
about the country that the violets have seriously interfered with the
hunting. Should the leniency of the weather continue, we may
expect to have everything before its proper time, and the summer
months will probably find us weary of salmon, sated with straw-
berries, _and supremely indifferent to green peas and roses. The
whitebait hold themselves in readiness to arrive at their usual
quarters at Greenwich whenever summoned by the head-waiter;
and the merle and the mavis are prepared to commence nidifiea-
tion at a moment's notice.
But many of the most remarkable concomitants of the season—we
are not now referring to BIELA'S friend—have unaccountably escaped
being made the subject of public comment. The season's influence
has extended to quarters where meteorological phenomena have
hitherto been supposed to exercise but little sway; and so striking
have been the results, that it appears a matter of national import-
ance to tabulate a few of the more prominent of them for present
investigation and future reference. The readings are in au cases
given in round numbers, and the instruments employed were the
same as those used at the Royal Observatory, Christiansund.'Skndes-
naes, Yalentia, &o.
MB. GBAY MAYOR cannot remember MBS. GRAY MAYOR'S temper
ever to have been so mild as during the current month. For many
years past he has kept a daily register of MRS. G. M.'s variations in
this respect, and since 1853, when they were on their wedding ex-
cursion in the Isle of Wight, he has no record of anything which
approaches the present happy state of things at Roselawn. He sin-
cerely hopes that the mildness both of the temperature and MARIA'S
temper will be of long continuance.
MR. DIQBY MILDMAY Goz LINO'S new volume of poems—Germ
and Spray—is rapidly approaching completion. MR. MILDUAY
GOZLING'S muse is habitually a gentle creature, but those who have
had the privilege of access to the proof-sheets of his forthcoming
work, are unanimous in their opinion of the extraordinary mildness
of its contents.
The inhabitants of Sleapingwell-cum-Slumberdown came away
from the last Penny Reading with an idea in their heads that MR.
TOLEMY'S elocutionary efforts and Miss WASSINGTON'S musical
performances were a little mild.
Those who study the devious oourse'pf events, and are constantly
on the watch for the slightest indications of new phases and fresh
currents in the vortex of life, have of late, day after day and
morning after morning, been struck—so much so, that they are in
communication on the subject with the Director of the Meteoro-
logical Office (as the Clerk of the Weather is now called)—with the
unusual mildness of their breakfast bacon.
Never since the House of Brunswick ascended the throne of these
realms, never since the commerce and manufactures of this sea-girt
land received a powerful impetus after the Repeal of the Corn and
Navigation Laws, never in the annals of Burton, Alton, Romford,
Stpgumber, Nottingham, and Chiswiok, has the consumption of
mild ale been greater than at this present hour—11 P.M., Thursday,
January 16, 1873.

and MB. CIIAHLKS PROSELEY PBOSELEY were undeniably mild.
Weather again!
A nice dish of early spring gossip was gathered at several tea-
parties last week.
PIOUS FRAUD.
THE following was telegraphed, on the 16th, from Rome :—
"The Senate has approved the suppression of religious instruction."
And this followed in the same telegram :—
"The POPE received several children to-day, and told them that after
repeated searches the bodies of the Apostles St. Philip and St. James had
been discovered in the Church of the Holy Apostles."
Surely this should have come first. It seems an excellent reason
for the action of the Senate. Dear good old Pius seems to have for-
gotten what his countryman wrote about maxima reverentia. He
has wit, and humour, and could easily have amused the children
without telling them such an amazing—one—as this. St. Philip, (a
married man, with a family, by the way) was buried at Hieropolis,
and according to the Roman Breviary itself, St. James was finally
buried at Compostella. Now the original Church of SS. Apostoli
(and precious hot that Piazza behind the Corso is sometimes) was
not built until the time of PKLAQIUS THE FIBST, in the sixth cen-
tury, more than 500 years after " Philip and Jacob." had gone ad
majores. His Holiness must have taken it for granted that Roman
chudren are very ill taught—and we dare say that they are.
A SPLIT IN THE FRENCH CHAMBERS.
SOME of the French Constitution-mongers, as we learn from the
Special Correspondent of the Times, are proposing to make a second
chamber by cutting the first in half. This reminds one of whit
CAPTAIN MABBYAT tells us of the Madeira Lizards in his Olla
Podrida—that if you caught one, pulled off its tail, and nicked the
last vertebra of the stump, the lizard not only lived happy ever
after, but developed two tails instead of one, and went about appa-
rently proud of his double appendage. Whether he was any the
wiser for it, or moved any the slower or straighter, the CAPTAIN
does not say. One does not very well see how an analogous way
of giving France two legislative bodies would be likely to improve
her Governmental course, if they are to be, like the Madeira Lizard's
two tails, only bifurcations of one and the same body, after all.
A Splendid Opportunity.
A GOOD many people seem to be uneasy in their minds about Lou i>
BYRON'S grammar and meaning in some of his famous lines to the
Ocean. Cannot the Spiritualists help them? Cannot they commu-
nicate with the Poet, and ascertain from him what he really did
write? By so doing, they would dissipate the anxieties of many
sensitive and excellent persons, and probably, after giving such a
practical proof of the use of Spiritualism, convert sceptics and un-
believers into inquirers and disciples.

THE FOURTH "R" AND ITS FRIENDS.
THE agitators of the Na-
tional Education League
are not Shakspearian actors
indeed, but they appear to
be busying themselves in
the performance of much
ado about nothing:. To
what end is the fuss they
are making with a view to
substitute secular for deno-
minational Schools P If
this change were accom-
plished it would certainly
have the effect of reducing
religion to the footing of an
educational extra, similar
to drawing and dancing1.
But are the Leaguers quite
sure that the consequence
of this would be to prevent
the rising generation or the
lower orders from being
taught religion? As the
case stands it may be ques-
tioned whether all the real
religion that any children
are imbued with is not
imparted to them out of
school. There appears very
great reason to doubt that any religion whatsoever is acquired by
the regulation-reading, and learning of Scripture by rote, and by
perfunctory and parochial psalmody. The enemies of religion may
rest pretty well assured that they cannot do better, or worse, than
to leave existing arrangements for inculcating it on the minds of
school-children alone.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MA.N.
He addresses the Editor, as usual, after visiting the Queen's and
the Globe.
As Your Representative I have 'not much to say about theatres
this week, except that I think there are too many of them. But I
shall have a good deal to say on certain matters deeply affecting
theatrical interests when I 've got no other subject to hand. For the
present suffice it to observe, that Ton went to see Cromwell at the
Queen's the other evening, and considering what you 'd previously
heard and. read about the play, You were—I mean I was for You—
agreeably surprised. Seeing that COLONEL RICHARDS' Cromwell—
COLONEL UK-MAUDS wrote it— is no more a play than the Cromwell
of Vii mK HUGO, great credit is due to the Stage Manager for the
dramatic form in which it appears before the public. Had it been
thus represented on its first night, no unfavourable verdict would
have been pronounced. But if, as I have just said, great credit is
now due to the Stage Manager for its present success, on whose
shoulders are we to lay the blame of its comparative failure origin-
ally ?.
This brings all interested in the Dramatic Art back to the
question of rehearsals. Now the preparation of an effect, like the
cooking of a chop, may be faulty either from under-doing or over-
doing. This being too serious a subject for this paper, I will dismiss
it by observing, that the most perfect effect in Cromwell appears
to have been the preparation of one of the greatest chops on
record, for the dream-tableau representing the decapitation of
CHARLES THE FIRST (I have had to mention him in every-
thing lately—bother!) is admirable, and brings down the curtain
on the First Act to enthusiastic applause. Ireton is as good in
MR. RYDER'S hands as the character can be. I am disposed
to say the same of MR. RIGNOLD as the Great Protector, had
not all my interest in him been, quite against my will, gradually
merged into a nervous anxiety about his wigs. As the curtain rose
on each Act, I found myself wondering what wig he 'd appear in this
time. I noticed Cromwell aging rapidly while Ireton and the rest
stood still at middle life: except, perhaps, MBS. CROMWELL, who
seemed to sympathise with her husband's hair. Is this to be hyper-
critical? I don't think so. No, at every fresh entrance Cromwell's
manner seemed to me to say, defiantly, Here I am again I what do
you think of this wig? Eh?" As his favourite daughter, Eliza-
beth, Miss W u.i. is had to contend against odds sufficient to have
beaten even a more experienced actress. To play a part to which
but little interest is from the first attached, to have to die hard for
no evident reason except to satisfy historical requirements, and to
have to relate three dreams, one after the other, while writhing
almost in articulo mortis on a sofa, just at a point when every one is
wishing the dramatic action to go on quickly if it is going on at all,
—these are severe tests of any artiste's power. Out of the ordeal she
came triumphantly. The audience welcomed her safe landing as
heartily as a crowd at a steeple-chace greet the gasping winner clear-
ing the last and most dangerous leap. When it was over, I, Sir, as
Your Kindhearted Representative, rejoiced that she had not to
ride that stiff course again. The Republican sentiments delivered
in the course of the play frequently elicited noisy responses from
some dashing spirits in the audience, but there are some damaging
hits at the mob put even into Ireton's month.
Sir, if You want to be harrowed—and, as Your Representative, I
am of opinion that you object to such an operation as much as would
the proverbial toad, were any choice given it — go to the Globe
Theatre, and see Tears, Idle Tears. Emphatically, I will not go
again. Professionally, or unprofessionally, I do not like being cut
up. And then—I was so thirsty when I came away! This resulted
in representing You, Sir, at EVANS'S, up to eighteenpence and one
o'clock in the morning. Never again with you, dear mother.
Tears, Idle Tears! is carefully written, and well played all
round. The great merit of MR. MONTAGUE'S acting in it is that it*
artistic repose never once distracts you from the pathos of the story.
To have been demonstrative would have been ruin. MR. FLOCK-
TON'S Doctor is one of the best bits of character I 've seen for some
time. Had not all, as I have said, been so good in it, the sudden
appearance of the child with such a name as " Pip" might have set
the audience laughing. As it is, there is a rustling for pockethand-
kerohiefs among the ladies, and twitching of the nose among such
gentlemen as are not disposed to yield to emotion without a struggle.
I saw many a stout heart succumb, and I said to myself there are
little favourites at home—and—and this is not a Christmas piece
any more than it is a comic song: nor, for the matter of that, was it
intended to be. ... But enough. I will not be harrowed. Where
shall we go, we thirsty ones P "Pip, old fellow, what larks!" as
Mister Joe Gargery used to say.
The idea of Marcel (Anglice, Tears, Idle Tears] was probably
suggested by La Joie fait peur. There is a kinship between the
two pieces. As Your Representative I considered the doleful per-
formance of the orchestra behind the scenes a decided mistake. At
first it occurred to me that they were the "Waits," and that MR.
MONTAGUE, in spite of all the efforts of doctor, nurse, and devoted
wife, would be goaded on to madness by these melancholy musicians.
Twopence from the open window would have sent them into the
next street, and it is evident that they couldn't have come to play
there by the doctor's orders. This music has a bad effect, because it
forces the audience to wonder what it is ("How I wonder what
you are ?"—DR. WATTS), and for what purpose it is there.
The thing is neither rich nor rare,
But why the deuce is it put there P
Adapted Quotation.
And these questions would not occur to them were the musicians in
their usual place. Whatever draws away the attention of the
audience from the action before their eyes, is, though useful and
necessary to a conjuring trick on the stage, worse than useless, and
quite unnecessary, in such a touohingly simple piece as this: and,
apropos of " waits," MR. MONTAGUE need hardly be reminded of the
effect, in technical language, of all " waits " on an audience how-
ever favourably disposed.
There is nothing theatrical calling for any particular remark from
me, as your Representative. By the way, in a foolish book, with
which Yon, Sir, who know all foolish books, are possibly acquainted,
and need not to be supplied with its name by Your Representative,
I found a burlesque speech on that of Hamlet's, where he quarrels
with Laertes, delivered by FOOTS, who, the writer says, was
"extravagantly outre " in his performance of Hamlet at Bath. It
runs thus: "But 'tis no matter—let Hercules himself do what he
may—the dog will mew—no, no, that's wrong—the cat will bark—
0 no, that's the dog—the dog will mew—no, that's the cat—no—
the cat will—the dog—&c., &c."—isn't this my Lord Dundreary
down to the ground? The book wherein I found this was published
eighty-nine years ago, and though, as I 've said before. You, Sir, of
course will remember it and all that therein is, yet it is not until
nearly ninety years have passed away that it has come under the
notice of YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
P.S. On dit.—The talented composer of " Spring! Spring! gentle
Spring," has most happily dedicated'it to MLLE. LULU. Gentle,"
though, is hardly the word for her spring. But no matter. "Flow
on, thou shining RIVIERE!" For the sake of simple pianofortista I
hope he will, in future compositions, avoid accidentals, which lead
to mishaps; but the advice is perhaps superfluous, as RIVIERE
would naturally run into C. Ahem! Good night, and bless you.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL

OUR DOMESTIC PROSPECTS.
XBE we to judge by the
advertisements, the time
is clearly coming when
servants will require to be
shown a written character,
when they choose to con-
descend to apply for a new
place. Ladies wishing; to
engage an under-kitohen
maid, for instance, will
be expected to produce a
letter stating their good
qualities, and recommend-
ing them as kind and hos-
pitable mistresses to ser-
vants who may think worth
their while to enter their
employment. Every lady
will, in short, find it need-
ful to provide herself with
duly signed credentials,
certifying that her ser-
vants have had nothing
to complain of while they
have remained with her,
and that they can find
not a word to say against
her when they have gone
to marry the butcher, or
the baker, or the candle-
stick-maker, or any still
more eligible lover of
their choice.
Without pretending to much power in the science of clairvoyance,
we think we can foresee the days when ladies wanting servants will
find themselves obliged to advertise their own good character and
qualities, and to state if they have given satisfaction in their
kitchen, and whether they are competent to fulfil the many duties
now expected of a mistress by those who occupy the top and bottom
of her house. MBS. A. B. will announce that she is liberal, good-
natured, and indulgent to her servants, and allows them every
liberty they may feel inclined to take. MRS. P. Q. will affirm that
she can show a ten years' character, and that Christmas-boxes are
abundant at her house. Or LADY X. Y. Z. will state that she is
highly recommended, and that in offering herself for a mistress's
situation she is willing to be taken upon trial for a month.
In fact, if things go on as they have recently been going, there is
no telling what inducements may be offered m the newspapers to
servants who are willing to occupy a place. "Followers, of course,
allowed, and furnished with Good Suppers," will be a common post-
script to be added to advertisements: and even scullery-maids will
be promised that a silk dress will be found them to adorn their
Sundays out. Plain cooks will be informed that perquisites and
policemen will be permitted at discretion, and that a cold dinner on
Sunday is sufficient for the family, although a hot one for the
kitchen will be sanctioned, if required. Ladies'-maids will hear
that their mistresses' new bonnets are always at their service when
they want to go a-visiting, and that once a fortnight they will have
a carriage found them for paying morning calls. Moreover, house-
maids will be told that a BBOADWOOD'S grand piano is provided in
their parlour, and that weekly singing-lessons will be given them
"free gratis if they so desire: while nearly every advertisement
will contain a final paragraph to the effect that once a month at
least, or of tener, if requisite, ah upper servants' ball will be given
in the drawing-room, which footmen with fine whiskers and from
the very highest families are invited to attend.
Don't We t
WE 'RE informed that in Happy Japan,
Folks are free to believe what they can;
But if they come teaching,

Ax advertisement describes a certain artist performing at the
Agricultural Hall as " the biggest Athlete in the world, hailed every
night by the Public as the TICHBOBN E of the Arena." Why so?
The TICHBORNE is a little boy; and the name of the big Athlete is
DTJ Bois, and not CASTBO.
LOOK AT HOME.
"INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.—BRISTOL, THOBSDAT EVENING.—A
Conference was held here to-day for the purpose of promoting international
arbitration. MR. II. RICHARD, M P. for Merthyr Tydvil, pointed out that
when difficulties aroae between com muni ties there was no recognised means or
settled tribunal to which those differences could be referred for pacific and
rational settlement. He urged that the Powers of Europe should be invited
to select a Congress of Jurists to settle international law, and that a tribunal
should be created to administer it, before which nations could plead, and by
whose decision! they should be bound. MR. RICHARD considered that Eng-
land should take the initiative; and backed up. as she would be, by America,
he bad no doubt it would have an effect throughout the civilised world which
would do more than anything; elte that had been done for the establishment
of permanent and universal peace. MR. B. MUKLKV, M.P., expressed his
hearty sympathy with the object of the Conference, and his intention to sup-
port MR. RICHARD in the resolution which he intended to submit to the House
of Commons."—Daily Niva, Friday, Jan. 17.
LOOK at home, you who 've the itch of cosmopolitan reforming,
Ere you tackle motes in others' eyes, see beams cleared from your
own:
While godless, ragged outcasts in your slums and gaols are
swarming,
Why to whitewash little blacks o'er sea have mission-trumpets
blown?
Here's Merthyr's Quaker Member— is't in blindness or in mockery ?—
Light of a Bristol Conference, for chaining dogs of war,
And preventing future smashes of international crockery,
By congresses of Jurists, jaw to substitute for jar.
If there's a pitying Power above who laughs at human folly,
What peals should shake the heavens as this broad-brimmed iron
lord
Comes hot from internecine strife o' the strike to fire his volley
At War's wasteland the M M fulness of settling strengths by sword!
With Capital and Labour at his door in bull-dog grapple,
Though one in tongue and one in creed, in country and in race,
Spite of talkers and of writers, and the voice of Church and Chapel,
To show up such warfare's madness, and the rights of either case,
While in Merthyr's misty mountains for the forges' busy brattle,
Is the dead silence, not of peace, but rest between the rounds,
Comes RICHABD, brow and hands still stained with grime and gore
of battle,
To tell the world how battle may be banished from its bounds!
A simple secret! Here it is, for a new Poor Richard's preaching,
To iron-lords and colliers, and others, not a few . . .
"Be just, true, and unselfish: shun ill-gains and over-reaching;
Do unto others as you would that they should do to you.
"Live, in a word, the .life Christ taught—and lived as well as
taught it;
And then, I '11 answer for it, that War will be no more:
For, in Strikes as well as States they '11 have dropped the tools
that wrought it,
No Bench of Jurists to be feed, no RICHABDSES to bore."
"BLESS THEE, THOU ART TRANSLATED."
The Oswestry Advertiser, after describing Mr. Punch's last
Cartoon, quotes the speech of the miner's wife, and adds :—
"Or to render it into the language that was spoken in Eden and will be
spoken in Heaven, 'He, Misdyr! Gwedwch chi fynoch chi boiti'r balot 'na
gyda'ohjwftuw, tase Jotoi gyda'r rtrtiwma, i wyddoch chi bas6'n hen wr i
lawr yn y gwaith, yn oeito cnnill tamed o gino i mi a'r ercti 'ma.—Hene i
chi."
We have some notion that the last three words mean " There't
for you," which is a phrase of South Wales. But if this is the talk
"on the side of the angels," we are not quite so sure of being in
concord with MB. DHHABLI. And is there no Welshangelio word
for " Strike "? We must look into MLLTON, who has recorded such
an event.
Meantime it is delightful to see the work that Mr. Punch's Car-
toon has already done. It was published on the Wednesday, and
on the Friday
'The workmen employed at the Blaina Ironworks, in Monmouthshire,
held a meeting, at which a Ballot was taken of the feelings of the men.
Upwards of 700 men, both colliers and ironworkers, voted, and the result was
that a majority of 368 declared in favour of the immediate resumption of
work."
When Mr. Punch considers what he does for the nation, he is
tempted to echo, with a variation, the celebrated speech of the great
LOBD CLIVE, and to declare that he is astonished at Himself.

Then, when his rifle he had cocked, and his eye had brought to bear
Where beyond Baloh and Bokhara loom the Khivan pastures fair,
Like a green ribbon lying 'twist border-breadths of sand,
Wide as Syr-Daria's stream feeds fat a space of hungry land;
Thither the Sentry pointed, and with loot serene and sly,
First brought his rifle to half-cook, and then un-oooked his eye.
"I see," he said, "a something IM rather not have seen,
A something like a Russian—at least, his jacket's green;
But I'm up to all colours—and to all moves I 'm fly,

He's still a long way off 'tis true: but my lungs I won't spare,
If he's an ear, to make him hear my challenge, "Who goes
there?"
"But who can tell if he's coming our way, or if he's not?
I should think he's out of hearing, as much as out of shot.
And surely 'tis too soon to call, with all this gray and green,
And all this range of desert, and this mountain-maze between."

"'Tis just a hundred years since our friend in green first made
Upon the tribes of Khiva a well-intentioned raid:
No donbt he had provocation, as he had, I don't deny,
When, beaten back, he tried it on, some thirty years gone by;
And so when half a year ago he tried it on again,
And MACKOSOFF, with IOSH of oamp and beasts, to bolt was fain.
"After Khiva comes Bokhara, then Kundooz, and then Caubul,
And then yon have JOHN RUSSIAN at close quarters with JOHN BULL.
Now, I've no doubt his intentions are as good as they can be,
But the further BULL and he are off, the better they 11 agree;
So 1 hope you '11 think it safer, while there is space to spare,
From behind a loaded rifle, to challenge ' Who goes there ?'"

HAPPY THOUGHTS.
The Last of The Nook—De Lunatico Inquirendo—further
Information—To Let—Finish.
E see the Gardener
approaching. Up the
kitchen garden walk:
dancing. A flower-
pot is on his head,
which drops off, and
a whip is in his hand.
His hair anyhow; he
hasn't got as far as
straws.
"He's a raming
maviao!" exclaims
my Aunt, and with
great presence of
mind begins to retreat
slowly towards the
house, keeping her
thumb on tne spring
of her sunshade;
having a vague idea
that to_put it up sud-
denly is a staggerer
for a lunatic. I nope
she won't do it, as it
might make him
worse.
"Colonel Cut," says
EKGLEMOBE, briefly.
I beg him to be calm, and pretend not to notice anything extra-
ordinary in the Gardener's manner.
Happy Thought.—Pretend.
We go to work to pretend. My Aunt retreating. I say to the
man, " How are you getting on?'
"Well," he replies, briskly. "The MIKADO himself couldn't
wish for more, except glass with care. Here's a treat for His Royal
Highness I
He lifts up a flower-pot, and shows us, planted underneath, an
upright stick with a red herring fastened to it by a bit of red
riband.
"That's my idea," he says, with pride. "That's ornamental
and fancy gardening. I 'm burning Guy Fawkes at the end there."
Then he adds, mysteriously, "Not a word to the Duke."
Pointing to the garden implements all planted in a row, he asks,
"What do you think of that P"
EXOLEMOBE replies, nervously, " Capital! couldn't be better."
'You don't think so," returns the Gardener, suspiciously.
Happy Thought.—To go on pretending. I feign an interest in
this plantation. What is its object P Is it Japanese? I ask.
"Do you know who the MIKADO is ?" he asks.
ENGLEMOBE, regaining courage, suggests, "Japanese TOMMY?"
"TOMMY!" shouts the mad Gardener (for there is no doubt about
it any longer). "You ain't a Fortyfold Jersey Blue, are you?"
EXGLEMOBE nervously twitches my sleeve, and wants me to come
away. No.1 must keep my eye on him.
Happy Thought.—Detain him in conversation while some one
goes tor a Policeman. Who? ENGLEMOBE might stay with him,
while / go and fetch a Constable. How to communicate this to
ENGLEMOBB? Await opportunity.
"These will grow ana be fruitful. Hush! Don't yon hear the
seeds coming up. Why, if you want to know all about gardening,
you must stand on your head and listen. Can you stand on your
head?"
"No; but then you see I 'm not a Gardener."
"I can. So can celery sauce."
Happy Thought.—Zen's an opportunity. While he's on his
head, secure his legs.
He does not, however, alter his position. He continues, cunningly,
"I don't, and I won't, because of my hair. Turnips, carrots, and
The White Incomparable can do what they like—I say nothing; it's
not my business, having been His Majesty's faithful servant for
years But"—here he creeps up to me cautiously and whispers
—" who's the Emerald Ringleader, with orchids in his eyes, wno 's
hiding in the ivy?"
ENGLEMOBE says, briskly, "We'll have him out. I'll go and
collar him."
The man stops him, taking ENGLEMOBE by the arm. ENGLEMOBE
looks at me helplessly. The Gardener holds him fast.
"Don't!" he whispers hurriedly. "Don't do it! He's an
Odontoglossos Pelargonium' If he's disturbed, he '11 shoot me."
"No ne won't," says ENGLEMOBE, soothingly.
"He will.'" cries the unfortunate lunatic, emphatically. "The
MIKADO has sent him for the turnip-juice. He's got a pistol!"
"Has he!" says ENOLBHOBE, more nervously than ever, and not
liking to contradict him again.
"Has he?" the Gardener exclaims, ironically. "Why you
know he has! You 're a Gladiolus Gandavensis. But they 've only
put grapes in it. I've got a bullet in mine.'"
Good Heavens 1
Happy Thought.—I.'ask him, as calmly as I can, to show me the
weapon.
He releases ENGLEMOBE (who takes this opportunity of getting
near the kitchen-door), and fumbles in a breast pocket of his waist-
coat.
"With a flowering stock," he murmurs to himself. "I always
keep'em by me. I've written a letter about 'em, and I thought
you 'd kindly give it to the Duke for me."
He is wandering again, and I begin to think the pistol a myth,
I assure him that I will take every care of his letter if he will intrust
it to me. Or
Happy Thought.—He can, I suggest, himself take it to the post-
office in the village.
Once out, he shan't come in again. Only couldn't I be indicted
for turning a madman out loose on the road P To lock him up
would be best. But where P His room is in a small cottage on the
premises next the stable. If he could only be enticed in there!
Happy Thought.—" Where's your coat?" I ask him.
He shakes his head and smiles. "I burnt it, so as to put 'em off
the scent. Chickweed and cinders is what we must come to at
last." He suddenly bestirs himself. "Earth up celery! Right
shoulders forward! Dig up vines, top, dibble, and dust-pans!"
Then he adds, with a wink of inexpressible slyness, "train up your
Gloxinias in silk stockings, and you '11 soon see who's the ehnmpy
Radish." Then suddenly, "You '11 excuse me for a moment, but
there's a friend of mine at the bottom of the pond, and I must just
go and see him. It's after hours, you know." He bows with the
utmost politeness, and walks away hurriedly.
Now what am I to do P
Happy' Thought.—Go in-doors, and keep him out.
So much is certain to begin with. Ana so much I do. The Rag
Doll housekeeper says, "I didn't like to tell you afore"
This is so odd. Servants never do like to acquaint you with any-
thing unpleasant—specially in the way of breakages, when after
being dumb for months they are quite surprised to find that only one
out of your two dozen choice pet glasses remains uninjured—the
fractures having, of course, happened "afore they come to the
place "—until you know all about it yourself, when you find that
they've known it for ever so long, generally, "since they first
corned."
She says, "I didn't like to tell you afore,"—sniff, and corner of
apron used—"but the young man as seemed strange, as I said,
Sir"—sniff, apron, curtsey—" but_he keeps on a saying as there 's
some pnsson with a long name 'id in the hivy, which he nas a loaded
firearms to go to look after him with."
"Have you seen it t"
"No, not azackly; "—sniff—" leastways, I 've heard it as he was
shootin' them spurrows."
"A gun?" asks ENGLEMOBE.
"No, Sir," answers the Rag Doll; "which it ain't not azaokly a
gun, nor yet a pistol, nor blumblebuss, but them new things as
goes round a' round and off ever so many times at once; an' I think
as the young man said as it were a garden name, convovolns, or
such like."
"Revolver!" exclaims my Aunt, who has a good ear for verbal
mistakes.
"Werry likely, Mum." _ Sniff. "I knowd it were sumfin o' that.
Look, Mum, if he ain't at it now."
From the window we see him. He is half hidden behind an
apple-tree, but we catch a glimpse of one arm with a pistol in its
hand, changing its aim every second.
We look all the doors.
"You see," says ENGLEMOHE, "it isn't safe for Mister Madman
to be about. Colonel Constable ought to be on in this scene."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A CHEERFUL WINTER.
MR. RAWLINSON'S DELIGHTFUL SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD LET IN AS MUCH COLD AIR AS POSSIBLE, AND SIT IN WARM WRAPS, is
LIKELY TO BE ENFORCED BY THE PRICE OF COALS. BEHOLD A SCENE FROM THE "MERRY ENGLAND OF THE FUTURE."
"Heavens!" exclaims my Aunt, " you see if one of us go put, he
might shoot, thinking it was his enemy coming out of the ivy. I
wish we 'd never come down here."
Decided. Aunt, little Uncles, and Nurse to go to town at once.
l''.\ciI.FMMHI: to see them from the front gate down to railway, and
to call in for police.
The whole kitchen garden is in utter disorder. The " Luniac " is
now engaged in breaking a few glass frames with a rake, occasionally
stopping to draw his pistol, and present it at some imaginary foe.
If the police won't come, if it s illegal to take up a mad servant,
then, what shall we do when the night comes on, and we can't see
where he is?
I watch him from the first-Hour window.
He has got a ladder. He is coming towards the house.
Happy Thought.—Get behind a curtain. Mustn't let him see me.
He stops. He fixes the ladder so that the toj> comes within a foot
of my window. I see it shaking, and he is coming up. I know that
his pistol is in his pocket. In his left hand he holds a string with
a large Spanish onion tied to it.
"Creepers up here," I hear him saying, "because of the cats."
He balances himself on the ladder, swinging the onion to and fro.
Presently it comes, like a stone from a sling, against the window,
smashing a Dane to atoms. "Oh my coniferous Geranium 1" I
hear him saying, and am conscious of the revolver being pointed
towards the broken glass.
Suddenly he turns on the ladder, roars with laughter, throws the
pistol at something or somebody below, and slides down like a
schoolboy on bannisters. I venture to look out. Two respect-
able-looking men have got him by the arms; they are talking
amicably, and ENOLEMORB, from below, is making signs to me not
to interrupt. Presently the unhappy man and his two keepers dis-
appear. KsiiLKMORF. comes up and explains.
He is quite off,his nut. Been little Master Ont-of-the-Way
for three weeks. Met Colonel Keeper in the village. From informa-
tion received, he came up here and nobbled him.
_ I announce my intention of shutting up The Nook till the spring
time. Perhaps altogether.
tin
You see," I say to ENGLEMORE, "to keep up a place like
he observes, parenthetically.
"Mister Farm of Four Acres,"
"Yes, Colonel; go ahead."
"Well—I mean it's very expensive, unless it's ready made to
hand."
"Yes. Turnips on Tap, Pig in the Pound, Greasy Grass and
Swan Swum over the Swamp. Daniel Drainage, Dicky Dirt, and
the great Dismal Damp. I know. Rheumatics murder Bleep. No
door-mat to-night."
"You agree with me that I 'd better give it up for the present?"
I ask.
"Yes," replies ENGLEMORE, with a certain amount of hesitation.
And then he says, "The fact is, I think your name had better be
Walker. Let it while you can. Yon may have some difficulty."
"In letting The Nook? What ?—rent too high?"
"No. But I've only just heard, here, that it has the reputa-
tion of being "He hesitates.
"What?7'
"Haunted. Your own Ghost on the premises. DIRCKS and
PBPPBR. How's your poor Goblin?"
"That decides me. We go. My Aunt couldn't live in a"
"In a 'Aunted house," says ENGLEMORE, adding "MISTBB
SHAKSPEABE," by way of giving his authority for the pun.
"I don't believe in ghosts," 1 say, stoutly.
ENGLEMORE winks. "Give a ghost a bad name, and there you
are. There wouldn't be the ghost of a chance of letting The Nook
if it smelt of spirits."
He is probably right. And so we decide. The Nook is To Let.
In the spring-time I may be on the look-out for some new Rural
Retreat, where the absence of Mister Drainage is not a drawback.
Any more difficulties with Gardeners would turn my hair grey.
For the present my name is London. Perhaps, one of these fine
days—I mean on any day when a ray may induce us to believe once
more in the Solar System—I may find the Paradise which shall be
all my fancy painted.
Till then, Farewell.

"'TWAS EDWIN'S SELF THAT PRESSED."
MB. EDWIN JAMES has returned to England, and fearlessly
demands that the Benchers shall re-consider his case, and re-admit
him to the honours of the English Bar. Mr. Punch exclaims, in
the humane language of the law, "Heaven send him a good de-
liverance." But what do the Americans say to his leaving them?
Tearfully, perhaps, with BEATTJE :—
"Would EDWIN thU majestic scene resign
For aught' BRITANNIA'S' puny craft tuppliei?"
One thing is quite certain. The learned gentleman appeals to
Judges who are men of the world, and also impartial men; and if

EVERT right-minded person must share the hope expressed by

"The unmistakable regard shown to the memory of the late EMPEROR, and
the manifest and very marked tokens of respect and deference paid at the
funeral to the person of the young EMPEROR, ought not to be without their
effect on France."
Yes. And may that effect be a promotion of good feeling towards
us; an increased sentiment of regard, esteem, and distinguished
consideration. Let us hope that no French journalist will suggest
to his countrymen that the love of Englishmen for NAPOLEON THE
Tin uii was owing to the fact that the third Empire had brought
France to grief.

ONLY A SUGGESTION.
IT is stated that the Basingstoke Bungs availed themselves of a
recent Ball to revenge themselves on gentlemen who were supposed
to approve the Licensing Act. Having got the carriages and horses,
the publicans are said to have refused to get licence to let them be
brought out after eleven at night, but intimated that the vehicles could
be had at six in the morning. If this is true, the Basingstoke
Bangs are a lot of ill-conditioned fellows. Bat Punch, who likes
to see everything in the sweetest light, inclines to believe that there
was an understanding between the hotel-keepers and the ladies, and
that the six o'clock in the morning arrangement was highly pleasing
to the latter. "A man's foes are (sometimes) those of his own
household."
Morrnonism Hade Easy.
ONE very notable expedient for putting down Polygamy in Utah
was devised by CHIEF JUSIICE M'KEAN. According to a contem-
porary :—
"On the ground that polygamisU are adulterers, and therefore guilty of a
deliberate violation of the lair, he laid it down that they were disqualified
from sitting on juries."
Could this rule have been maintained it would have been enough
to make every mm liable to serve on juries a polygamist. If it
were to be established in this country, the effect of its operation
wonld, especially in Middlesex, no doubt be an immediate and
extensive creation of British Mormons.
"THESE LET THEM—LAY."
OUR excellent young friend, the Echo, quotes a Keltic paper
which, after duly libelling England, says, "The Irish have good
memories." A rude proverb tells us that some of them should have,
at all events.

THE WEATHER AND THE CHACE.
SOUTHERLY wind and a
cloudy sky" used to
"proclaim a hunting
morning." The late
rains, however, ;have
proved too much of a
good thing for Venator,
in places. They have
especially affected the
neighbourhood of Wind-
sor, laying a large por-
tion of it under water,
liunnymede has been
running at a rate the
like of which has seldom
if ever occurred since
the date of Magna
Charta, and certainly
would not have hap-
pened then, or else
Kunnymede would have
been a site whereon it
would have been quite
impossible to lay the
foundations of British
Liberty. Windsor Castle
stands on an Ararat
whieh'yet rears its head
above the deluge; and
long may it do so; but
the following announce-
ment appeared the other day in the morning papers:—
"HER MAJESTY'S STAOHOUNDS.—Owing to the extremely wet weather,
Her Majesty's Hounds will not hunt on Friday, as advertised; nor again
until further notice."
The Stags may thank the weather which has preserved them from
being chased by Her Majesty's Hounds, but, as those royal animals
are not permitted to kill them, it is possible that they would rather
have been regularly hunted than baited in the way they have been
now for three months, whilst it has rained cats and dogs. Not only
dogs, observe, but cats; so that the weather must not only have
been unpleasant for bucks and does, but equally so for "rats and
mice and such small deer," which are the quarry of the feline species.

RETAIL TRADERS, BEWARE!
MB. PUNCH begs to apprise the Retail Trade that its time has
come. Up with all the Shutters I Announce Sale by Auction at
any Sacrifice. Listen to the Lancet .—
"The fact u, that retail trade is gone mad. There are far more shop-
keepers than the wants of the public require, and they think themselves
entitled to all the luxuries and enjoyments of life. Their wives, glorious in
sealskin jackets and redundant jewellery, are to be seen everywhere; and the
Sretensions of the class are becoming a nuisance that it is high time to put
own."
Pat it down, then—pretensions, class, sealskin-jackets, and all!
Surge, carnifex! The Lancet and the Profession have the matter
in their own hands. If every Medical Man will undertake to exter-
minate—of course in a regular way—a single streetful of retailers
and their families, the business may be done in the twinkling of a
pestle and mortar.
"Charge for the golden guineas. Upon them with the—Lancet."
Passing Oddities.
wayfarer does read some strange announcements. -At
Knightsbridge, a few days ago, he may have observed a shop-
window stuck full of bills, some offering, in large letters, "Gas
Stoves." and others, intermingled with them. "Skates." Season-
able advertisements during the late weather. In the New Turnstile,
Holborn, an inscription on the wall proclaims " Gentlemen's Repairs
Done." Within one would imagine a surgery. The reality is a
boot-shop.

AN UNDESIRA.BLE FALL IN COLE.
"MR. H. COLE. C.B.—On Wednesday evening, in distributing the prizei
to the successful students of the Nottingham School of Art, Ma. H. COLE,
C.B., announced his intention of retiring from public sarvice, of which he
would next April have completed fifty years."
"' AN undesirable fall in coal'? Nay, Mr. Punch, not so—
'There's no such thing,' as SHAKSPBARE says, by my coal-bills
well I know."
"0 yes—'tis true—my dear JOHCT BULL; you '11 agree with what I

'a,'
"When I tell yon that I refer to KINO CoLHj to HENRY COLE, C.B.,

But for getting up steam—or smoke at need—there's none with old

Who can reckon how many horse-power he's brought to bear upon
Whigs and Tories?
"Punch may have laughed, and set others to laugh, at the deeds of

But at bottom, he knew, as the old song says, that he was ' a jolly
old soul!'
That ne'er before did England so well his Fine-Art hobby instal,
Even when his fiddlers a thousand not three he bade to the Albert
Hall!
"What courage short of his courage would have dared to face and
floor
The sense that an Exhibition each year is a yearly bore?
What stubbornness, but his stubbornness, would the purse-strings'

"If Art in England is e'er to take root—some may think that a

She may thank KINO COLE, her friend at heart, in spite of many a

If Science is e'er to bear English fruit, unless in practice's soil,
Of its grafting and planting in our schools KINO COLE has borne the

"And when, after fifty years' hard work, KINO COLB takes his rest
at last,
Punch will call for a 'three times three for him,' for faithful service
past:
May whatever King reigns after him not make us regret KING
COLE—
Who has done his King's work right royally, and is a jolly old soul!"
Q. E. D.
THE new and learned Judge of the Probate Court has decided that
a certain testator was of perfectly sound mind, although he was in
the habit of asserting that watering-place landladies are, mostly,
extortionate sharks. "Although" is, probably, not the word which
Paterfamilias would have used.
Help the Helpless.
WRETCHED street-boys are not to be rescued and sent to school,
says MB. FOESTEB, because that would be interfering with the rights

PHYSIC FOR THE PEOPLE.
A LEADING article in the Times on " Hospital Belief," written by
somebody who understands his subject, contains the following note-
worthy passage relative to an important truth in connection with it,
pointed out by DB. CHASDLEB :—
"The worthy Doctor says that what the people really want is, not drugs,
but good advice; that is, rules of health, warning against foolish neglects,
and common precaution. It is most true. But it is unhappily also true that
there is nothing the poor like so little aa good advice. They consider
medicine a mystery of a very preternatural character; the drug a charm,
which is to work a miracle. The plainer a thing is to the unassisted reason,
the less they will believe it. They want to be told how they may be cured
in a day. They would rather take the most nauseous medicine than obey the
simplest and easiest advice."
The irrational notions of medicine above indicated are, indeed,
very generally characteristic of the poor, that is to say, the indigent
classes. But they characterise also a great many other poor of a
certain sort, of whom many are rolling in rents and dividends, and
all are in easy circumstances, but who, respecting medical knowledge
and medical reasoning, labour under poverty of ideas and poverty
of intellect. With regard to this kindTpf poor a Doctor of Medicine
may sjay, in the words of a Doctor of Divinity and a Poet :—
"Whene'er I take my walks abroad
How many poor I see!"
The affluent, for the most part, equally with the destitute, believe
in drugs, and do not believe in the natural laws, and the necessity
of the observance of physiological conditions, notably those of diet
and exercise, to the cure of any serious disease. Is not this mental
poverty lamentable? Quite the reverse to a very considerable
number of persons; all the Chemists and Druggists, whom it profits,
and all the Medical Practitioners who live by relieving mere sym-
ptoms, and keeping their patients, radically uncured, as long as
possible on their hands.
In the article above-quoted occurs also this pertinent and season-
able question :—
"Why cannot the Working Classes of the Metropolis, and all who will claim
the privileges of that title, form themselves into Sick Friendly Clubs, under
any medical staff they may have their own reason to prefer i"
The Working-Men, not only in London, but throughout the king-
dom, find no difficulty whatsoever in forming themselves into Trades'
Unions. It would be not at all more difficult for them to form
themselves likewise into Sick or Invalids' Unions. Possibly circum-
stances will ere long force them into this desirable kind of co-opera-
tion. It was all very well, in accordance with the tradition of other
days, for the Clergy to preach up munificence to medical charities,
upon " Hospital Sunday." But the classes whom sermons on behalf
of those institutions are calculated to benefit will soon perhaps find
themselves left to maintain them by their own efforts; by combina-
tion, such as the Trades' Unionists practise in their continual Strikes,
whereby they keep on raising the prices of meat and almost every-
thing else. Consumers, daily more and more impoverished by the
general dearth they owe to the combinations of workmen, cannot
but feel inclined to leave them to combine, and do what they can
for themselves altogether. People whom strikes oblige to economise
their expenditure will naturally begin retrenchment by withdrawing
all the subscriptions which they have been accustomed to contribute
to the assistance of the Striking Classes.

CLASSICAL INTELLIGENCE.

OOK here, Mr, Punch, don't I just wish I lived in France!—
at least, I don't know that quite, 'cause they don't play
cricket, do they? But at any rate I wish they 'd teach us
Latin here like the chaps are taught in Paris. Just see what
that jolly old JTTLKS Snuow hag been doing for them:—
"He never meant to check the study of the noble dead languages, which taught history
and fostered civilisation: but he was penuaded they might be learned quicker and better
than under the old system. He had only suppressed the useless
drudgery of making Latin verses."
Useless drudgery! My eye! Ain't old JTJLES a jolly
brick! Fancy what the Doctor would say to any fellow
who called making Latin verses only downright useless
drudgery! And I 'm cocksure half our fellows don't
believe it 'a any better, foeta nascitur, you know, and
you can't make fellows poets by making them make
verses. Even nonsense verses are a regular beastly
nuisance. Why, I got nearly swished, last half, for
putting this for a pentameter,—

LOGICAL DEMONSTRATION.
A DEKONSTBITIOJT of Working Men against the Malt-tax came off
the other day upon the Thames Embankment. This demonstration
was distinguished by the unusual merit of being to some extent
logical:—
"A Resolution advocating the total repeal of the Malt-tax as a further
instalment of the promise made by English Statesmen of a free breakfast,
dinner, and supper table, was carried with acclamation."
It may be said with truth that breakfast was the only one of
those three meals of which any Statesman, so called, ever promised
the freedom. More, it may be suggested that whoever promised a
free breakfast table, not also promising a free dinner and supper
table, was no Statesman. By how much are A.'s tea and sugar more
entitled to emancipation than B.'s wine, beer, and spirits? In no
degree whatever. Therefore there was logic ia the Thames Em-
bankment demonstration against the Malt-tax. The CHANCELLOR
OF THE EXCHEQUER, certainly, would be unfit for his office if he
allowed the Malt-tax to survive the next Session whereas he could
honestly do without it. But our friends in fustian and flannel
jackets, who have raised the price of meat by consuming it at every
meal, including, in many cases, a fourth every day, ask too much
in asking for free meals at the expense of other people, mostly very
much worse off than themselves. The Minister who would not
scruple to comply with their demand would rob the latter to bribe
the former for their votes. The classes at present subject to direct
taxation and indirect too, with a view to curry additional favour
with those touched only by the latter, would be still more grossly
plundered than they are now by that expedient for effecting the
freedom of tables. The Great Untaxed would owe the free breakfast
table, no less than any other free table realised for them by .such
means, to the finance of a rogue.
Taking Care of the Fence.
THE Anstrians seem to be as close calculators as the Scotch, and
to have a lofty disdain of round numbers. An official estimate has
been prepared at Vienna of the cost of the Great Exhibition which
is to be held there this summer, and a statement pat forth that the
entire expenses, up to the time of closing the accounts at the end of
the year, will be lt 13,238,396 florins 30 kreuzers." Let us cherish a
hope that this estimate will not be exceeded; and, above all, that
those odd kreuzers may not expand into an additional florin by the
end of the year.

No day bat famous lives pass into fames:
We hear Time's footstep in the death-bell's toll
Through the grey Abbey, walled with deathless names,
For whom, in other sense than for the crowd,
Death is the portal of a larger life,
Where radiance of renown dispels earth's cloud,
And Time's clear doom rings o'er the moment's strife.
Lo, this week's convoy to the land of rest!
The venerable Judge, in whose stretched years
Present and past joined hands: who had the best
Of two great generations for liia peers.
Whose boyhood drank the ferment of hot thought
That shaped out age: whose young heart leapt to France,
With her new wine of dreams and hopes distraught,
Brandishing at Old Wrong a hasty lance.
Who watched that lance's light, flash, flare, and fade
In blood and brands: who Earth's Colossus saw
Was in his stride, till Europe crouched dismayed
In the dark shadow, where his lip was law.
"Who watched the broadening of our base of power:
Hailed wider trust, and freer scope for all;
Knew War's long burden: Peace's blessed hour:
Rise of new states, and ancient orders' fall;
Who bore a man's part in the shaping toil
Of State and Senate; in the seat of law
Holding his robe of ermine pure of soil,
Wearing his crown of honour free fronVflaw;
Yet cheerful still, under his load of years,
Experience, labours of the judgment-seat.
With kindness that robbed humble folk of fears,
And love that gathered children round his feet.

And quick to help them howsoe'er he could.

The ink scarce dry in the unwearied pen,
Thinking of other battles to be fought,

SABBATARIAN SUGGESTIONS.
UDICIOUS Members of the
Working-Men's Lard's
Bay Rest Association en-
tertain the opinion that
"great evil" is "caused
by the use of public ve-
hicles by professing Chris-
tians on the Lord's Day."
Believing this, they are
rather to be commended
for sending a deputation
to the BISHOP OP LONDON
for the purpose of calling
his Lordship's attention to
it, and considering "how
best to bring the subject
under the noticejof Chris-
tian people." For they
might have gone and
waited on the PKKMIKB or
the HOME SECRKTAKY, and
invited the Government,
on. behalf of the Sabba-
tarians, to persecute the
Excursionists. Then would ignorant and stupid bigots have wasted
Ministerial time.
MB. GIBDLBSIONM, as Chairman of the Association above named,
introduced its delegates to the Right Reverened Prelate with an
address, in the course of which he observed that:—
"A very great scuudul in connection with thi« matter was that the Church
of England sooieties went very largely in the direction complained of.
Deputations formed for the purpose of advocating the cause of Christ travelled
on the Sunday without any apparent consciousness of the evil they were
doing, and without any knowledge of the hatred with which they were
received in travelling on Sunday while wearing the white cravat which
indicated that they were the servants of Our Lord."
Did the speaker mean to say that Clergymen travelling on Sunday
to preach sermons at remote places are therefore received with
hatred by the Working-Men's Lord's Day Rest Association? And
does he suppose that St. Paul, for instance, wore a white tie?
The Bishop who heard MB. GIBDLESTONE deliver himself as above
preserved his gravity notwithstanding. He heard more besides,
which must have tried it hard. MB. GIBDLKSTONE concluded by
telling him that:—
The deputation were anxious that his Lordship should deliver a special
sermon at St. Paul's on this subject, and they were deeirou* that, for tha sake
of example, he should avoid driving to the Cathedral."
In answer to this consistent but ridiculous suggestion—
"The BISHOP OF LONDON said that, if he could not do so, he should be
compelled to walk from hie residence of Fulham.
"MR. GIRDLBSTONE replied that Hia Lordship might sleep at the Chapter
House on Saturday night.
"And," on reflection he would perhaps have added, "stay there
until Monday morning." But the Sabbatarians do not reflect.
The BISHOP OF LONDON, in his final reply to MB. GIBDLBSTONE,
very carefully practised the positive iuj uuetiun delivered by the wisest
of men and kings in a certain two-sided proverb. He answered his
memorialist according to that gentleman's understanding. How-
ever, he might have asked him whether walking on foot or riding
all the way from Fulham to St. Paul's would be, for a Bishop of
more than mature age, doing the greater amount of work on a
Sunday? ========

TWO TO ONE ON TAXATION.
THE following ingenuous passage occurs in a letter to the Times,
signed " RICHARD ATTENBOBOUOH " :—
"Allow me to say that in advocating the continuation of the Income-tax
as a permanent source of revenue you are at variance with PITT, PEEL, and
even MR. Lows himself. No Chancellor of the Exchequer hu yet dared to
make this proposition; and I have no hesitation in saying that the fate of any
Ministry which ventured to adopt such a. policy would be at once sealed."
MB. A HEN noKonni seems to suppose, in his simplicity, that, in
declaring their policy, Premiers and Chancellors of the Exchequer
are accustomed to tell the truth. If the Income-tax had not been
imposed, and renewed from time to time, on the false pretence that
it was to be temporary, its victims would never have stood it.

So far, then, we have reason to conclude that he considers his
mission to have resulted in a dead failure.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEL
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
He addresses the Editor, after visiting Burlington House, and
reaching Gallery No. I. of the Old Masters1 Exhibition.

told my
friend WAOG that
I was groins' to
represent You,
Sir, among the
"Old Masters'
you will probably
guess what was
WAGG'S jocose re-
joinder.
It was a jest of
some antiquity,
and bore testi-
mony to your Re-
presentative's re-
putation as a sort
of King-Gallant-
man. Entendez-
vousf Because, if
you don't "on-
tondy," I am not
going to explain.
The day arrived
when I saw be-
fore me a divided
duty. Either to
represent You,
Sir, at the Hair-
dresaerV-
Void h Earlier!
The Barber for
your hair!
— which you can
sing to the air of
"Void le Sabre"— or to appear for you among the aforementioned
Old M asters. I decided for the latter, and without breathing: a word
on the subject to any one, except WAGG, I wrapped myself in impe-
netrable mystery, that is a waterproof over-cloak, turned up my
trousers in order to turn up a dirty bye-street or two, tributaries of
the Great Piccadilly River (which really sounds uncommonly like
something grand of the sort in America) , and finally appeared as my-
self (" afterwards" You), at the entrance of tiie Royal Academy.
I was a trifle musical that morning, and being thereto inspired it
occurred to me to hum the tune which Myles na Coppaleen used to
sing in the Colleen Bawn, adapting my words to the occasion :—
0 Burlington House is a pleasant place
In the glorious month of July:
With its tabbley-aux
In paint and chalks,
And its light all from the sky.
Och I divil a doubt
We'd be nothing without
The Ryal A-cad-e-my!
Thus humming, like the busy bee that I am when in my favourite
Representative character, I walked into the long passage of the
Academy as boldly as POBSON would have walked into the longest
passage of the Academia. Let us at least be classical as we enter
within these portals.
Read the Dantesque inscription —
All Sticks abandon, ye tcho enter here.
"Sticks" include umbrellas; for you can't, as WAGO says, leave
your umbrella without the stick. At this Passage of the Styx I saw
the first signs of the Old Masters. I said this to WAGG, who imme-
diately replied that "the Old Masters didn't paint signs." I had,
however, alluded to the two Old Masters before us, who, standing in
two docks on each side of the hall, might have been taken for
either two respectable prisoners awaiting a verdict, or for two Old
Masters in Chancery, without any prospect of escape, except by
vaulting over the barrier and running away. One of these Old
Masters was the Guardian of the Umbrellas, and the other sold
Catalogues, and both had the air of haying undertaken their respec-
tive offices from a real love of work itself, without hope of wage
from employers, or of gratuities from visitors. I think '.that the
elderly gentleman who. relieved me of my umbrella had in him the
Brigand instincts of younger days, when perhaps he had delighted
in the wild stories of DICK Ti KPI \ and the gallants of the road.
There was a twinkle in his old eye when he made me "stand and
deliver " my umbrella, that caused me almost to wink at him in
return, as much as to say, "Hallo! old Slyboots, I 'm up to you!"
But I remembered whom I was representing' and forbore. On my
quitting the Exhibition I fancy a tear trickled down his furrowed
check when, on presenting his ticket, he was forced to return my
umbrella. It seemed to me that, even up to the last moment, he
had entertained a desperate hope either of my having lost the ticket,
or, perhaps, of my being so occupied with the impressions of the
sight within as to pass out without remembering my umbrella. Sir,
in Your cause personally, I not only remembered my umbrella, but
I remembered my honest old friend, who thanked me with a bow
that would have done honour to as old a Master aa CLAUDE; I mean,
in this instance, CLAUDE Du YAL.
But, Sir, I have come out before I have gone in. Let me not keep
you longer in the draught, for you are placed in much the same
position in this Academician passage as is a pea in a tin pea-shooter,
but watch me ascend the staircase with all the determination of a
resolute spirit, who, seeing his progress barred by gates and warders,
prepares himself to encounter opposition and to overcome it. So
formidable did this array at the head of the staircase appear to me,
that I began to admire the crafty forethought which had deprived
me of my trusty Excalibur— meaning my umbrella. It was like
taking the sword and spear from Sir Launcelot before he entered
the Valley of Banger, it was sending DAVID out against GOLIATH,
and depriving him of his sling and stone (giving him a ticket for it)
at the camp gate. What man dare I dare; and, as Your Repre-
sentative, I dare do all that may become a man, and, permit me to
add, he who dares more is not Your Representative.
Four janitors were at the wicket. I tendered a sovereign to the
wicket-keeper in the middle. He would none of it; but motioned
me towards a young man, absorbed in a volume of light literature,
and seated, on my right, behind a semicircular sort of split rostrum,
which seemed to have been made, economically, out of an old
washing-tub cut in half. On a red baize shelf before him were
placed several little wooden bowls such as are used indiscriminate!y
for milk, kitchen soap, or dressmakers' pins, but which were filled
on this occasion with various coins of the realm in gold, silver, and
copper. To him I offered my sovereign. He regarded me in an
abstracted manner, as if annoyed at my interrupting him in the
middle of his novel, and then, awaking to a sense of my require-
ments, which were simple, modest, and intelligible, he took my
sovereign carelessly, as though I'd asked him to do a conjuring
trick with it of which he was a trifle tired, and, having dropped it
into the bowl (I really hoped he wouldn't take up his interesting
book at this point, and forget all about me), and deliberately se-
lected a half-sovereign from another, still as with an eye to a bit of
sleight-of-hand, he took the requisite number of shillings from
a third bowl, and handing the sum to me, said not a word, but
dived into his book again, wiping Your Representative, as it were,
clean off his slate. What I thought to myself, I shall not record
here. But, 0 young man, if ever in after-life ... no matter. Let
me in.
To be let in at Burlington House is a difficulty. Not but that
the best judges of painting are taken in here occasionally, when
they mistake SMITH'S picture of The Pavilion, Brighton, oy Moon-
light, for an undoubted Canaletti. But the difficulty Your Repre-
sentative alludes to is to be found at the turnstile itself, which is as
stiff as a Vandyck portrait, and when with some muscular exertion
pushed, gives forth a sound resembling the harsh cry of some strange
bird—probably called " The Roopy "—in the Zoological Gardens. In
Fact, Sir, as representing you, I said to WAGG, "You won't go into
the Academy without a good deal of pressing." Now this pressure
3an be exerted with comparative facility by some, not (for ana-
tomical reasons into which this is not the place to enter) by others.
Slender steps in where Falslaff fears to tread.
I represented You up to Sixpence more in the purchase of a cata-
.ogne, but refused the proffered pencil at another twopence. Two-
pence more, and I should have been broke. So, Sir, with a light
leart, catalogue in hand, and twopence, for an emergency, in my
pocket, I represented you gaily in Gallery Number One, which was
;olerably full.
_ I will do this thoroughly, I said to myself, as Your Representa-
tive, because I have yet to finish the South Kensington and' the
National Portrait Gallery, where I believe they have for weeks been
expecting me, with practical jokes behind doors and in dark pas-
sages. When they are least prepared I shall be there. Now, I am
with the Old Masters.
I notice, as something most remarkable, what a number of short-
sighted people there are in the world. At all events, what a number
sf intelligent myopes come to see these pictures. Not only to see,
but to examine closely, to sift the method down to the very canvass,
and I further observed they all went at the Old Masters' pictures
with their noses, as though they could detect genuineness by the
smell. They got on the trail, and exclaimed, "This is a Vandyck."
"this is a Turner," "this is a Reynolds," as one hound might
whisper exultingly to his companion, "This is a Fox. Come along,
we've got him 1 And then I also observed that when these amateur

short-sighted critics had hunted their Old Master down, they kept
up their sporting; character by palling the painter to pieces, so that
there 'd have been scarcely so much as his brush left as a keepsake
for his followers. These spectacled, pince-nez'd, and one-glassed
amateurs talked to be overheard, and so, while like PAT JENNINGS, in
Rejected Addresses, I "in the Gallery sat," my ears were tickled by
the rustling wings of Folly as she flattered round the room.
Sir, what [marvellously wise things are uttered in a picture
gallery. Everybody is a judge of pictures, of course, as Everybody
is a born theologian.
I seated myself, calmly surveying the languidly busy scene; for,
going suddenly into a crowded room has upon Tour Representative
the effect of, as it were, coming up from a first plunge in the sea,
when the eyes are unsteady, and there are cavernous murmurs in
the ears, and when, if anybody speaks to you, you feel annoyed at
his inopportune remark, whatever it was, and say, "Eh—what?"
rather sharply. Much the same as this sensation, only without any
of its freshness and invigoration, is what is usually felt on entering
any thronged room by yours truly, who sits for the present on the
first chair in the first Gallery—for " the force of lounging can no
further go "—and signs himself now as ever, Your

AN ANTIQUARY'S HINT.
As SOME EXCITSE FOR A LITTLE MORE HAIR, WOULD NOT AN OLD
MARLBOROTJGH WIG BE EFFECTIVE?
FASHIONABLE PLAGIAEY.
IT any proof were wanted that Luna is a lady, it might be fur-
nished by the fact that she so constantly is changing. The changes
of the moon are pretty nigh as frequent as the changes of the
fashions, and, after all, there is no novelty in either variations. The
"old order" (to the milliner) differs little from the new; and as
history repeats itself, so likewise do the fashion-books. For instance,
see this statement by a recent traveller :—
"The Grecian bend is an old institution in Japan; and to aee one of those
dark-skinned ladies, with her extensive head-dress, a hump upon her back,
an extremely narrow akirt, high wooden pattens, her body thrown forward aa
.-ho minces her steps, yon would imagine that she was ridiculing the brainless
votaries of fashion in other lands; but she is only dressing as her people have
dressed, and walking as they have walked, for centuries."
In Central Africa, we are told, the ladies paint their faces and
wear chignons on their heads, exactly as their foremothers for ages
there have done, and just as other ladies have but lately learnt to
do, in countries which by some people are deemed more highly
civilised. So, too, the Grecian bend of Bond Street is borrowed
from Japan, and has there been seen for centuries, although here
esteemed a novelty, and therefore made the most of by our fashion-
able folk. A savage with an eyeglass would afford a novel spec-
tacle, yet we haply may discover some wild tribe thus ocularly
decorated, and, 'moreover, wearing a camellia in the button-hole,
and a chimney-pot black hat. If in this way it be provable that
novelties of fashion are no better than mere plagiaries, common
sense would hint a hope that the ladies might be found less eager
for snob, novelties than they seem to be at present. But the ques-
tion may be asked, when, in fashionable matters, will ladies ever
listen to the hints of common sense f
A Knight of the Keys.
M. BE BouBoonro, on leaving Rome, received a remarkable honour
from the POPR. The Holy, Father named him " Grand Offloer of the
Ordine Piano." This appointment would have passed without
remark if it had been conferred on the ABBE LISZT. But is M. DB
BOUBGOING also among the pianists? He is not known to be a per-
former en any instrument, although, no doubt, the POPE considers
him to have proved himself instrumental to His Holinem's purposes.
THE ECONOMIST'S CAROL.
MY boots may not again be mended;
Reported worth it now no more.
On a new pair must be expended
A portion of my measured store.
My sliirts are likewise all in tatters,
My socks and under-clothing too;
Though their state not so greatly matters,
Because they are concealed from view.
But they '11 no longer hold together;
They 're worn too thin for wintry weather.
Mine outer garments no repairing
Will make to last another span,
And not attract to me the staring
Attention of my fellow-man.
There's nought so hard in being needy,
Small clerks and tnivniHers at the desk,
Than that it dooms men to go seedy,
And makes them otherwise grotesque;
Unless, indeed, all care you smother
For the derision of your Brother.
My stock of coals so low has dwindled,
That I require a fresh supply:
A costly fire I must have kindled,
To cook high-prioed provisions by.
All these expenses, down together
On poor PILGABLICK, bid him spare
Internal fence from wintry weather;
Interior lined with winter's fare.
Good cheer; the chief alleviation,
Besides a pipe, of tribulation.
Now'sing old Hose, and burn the bellows,
Secure of affluence, 0 ye blest 1
The rich man only, like you follows,
Can e'er a conscience keep at rest.
You can pursue investigations,
And minds serene to work devote,
Nor need to make your calculations
Before you get another coat.

Well!—it will be my last, however.
SPECULATION SPOILED.
THE eye of some meteorologist, wearied with continuous rainfall,
may have been agreeably attracted by the heading of a paragraph
in the Post .—
"FALL OF CHALK AT DOVER.—Another fall of chalk has taken place
on the South-Eastern Railway, between Shakspeare's and Abbott's Cliffs, at
Dover tunnel, but no injury to life or property wa« occasioned."
Heading thus far at least, a philosopher concerned in the study of
meteoric phenomena might naturally enough imagine the fall of
c halk reported to have taken place on _the South-Eastern Railway,
t o have been a shower of aerolites consisting of that substance. As
c halk is a marine formation, composed chiefly of organic remains, its
d escent in the form of fragments of asteroids or planetary bodies
w ould suggest the most absorbing trains of thought, and afford ma-
te rials for researches of the profoundest interest. But these pro-
pi ising ideas are disappointingly dissipated by the statement which,
in the next sentence, informs the reader that—
"The guns of the Drop Bedoubt have been unlimbered for fear of acci-
dents."
Sold I Such is the exclamation which bursts from the philoso-
pher'a lips on discovering, inferentially, from this additional in-
f ormation, that the fall of chalk at Dover, on the South-Eastern
R ail way, was merely another landslip from Dover Cliffs. This,
p erhaps he mournfully observes, had no relation to meteorology,
e xcept in having been caused by the late wet weather.
A Privileged Fair.
THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE perhaps had one more reaion than he
mentioned for not committing MESSRS. WHALLEY and GDTLDFOBD
OWSLOW for contempt of Court. His Lordship very likely considered
that, in stumping the country, and aspersing persons of honour, on
behalf of CASTRO, they had sufficiently committed themselves.

ADDRESSING a meeting of Roman Catholics at the Town-hall.
Birmingham, the other day, DR. ULLATHORNE, titular Bishop of

"To take other's property, as had been done in Italy, was Liberalism; to
say that there should be no authority, to denounce property as theft, and to
trarn national monuments, aa the Communists of France did, that was
Liberalism."
It is not, however, cruel of Liberalism to burn monuments; it is
only barbarous. Monuments cannot feel, even if they are statues
of Saints. Dogmatism, the opposite to what DR. ULLATHORKE calls
Liberalism, has burnt other combustibles more sensitive to fire than
monuments. It may be said that Liberalism would abolish all
stakes in the country. Would not Dogmatism erect stakes if it
could?

hair dark? Perhaps it would only turn his head without affecting
his hair. But, if in a position to be tested on this point, one would
not object. What PEABODY will try the experiment?

CHILDREN IN ARMS.
PEOPLE who love peace will doubtless read with interest
this brief extract from a lecture upon Gunnery:—
"Already SIR W. ARMSTRONG and SIR J. WHITWORTH
engaged to make guns able to piercs 24 inches of plating; but
MH. BESSEMER promised a gun which would fire a ball of five
tons at the rate of one a minute. (Churi and a laugh.) Beside
this gun the Woolwich Infant would become a baby indeed. (A
laugh.) If that would not be sufficient, he could make one to
fire a ball of ten tons."
War will clearly be qo child's play when infants and
babies such as these -ill be employed in it. Balls of
ten tons each will be a rather costly kind of infant
entertainments. A nation surely will think twice before
it goes to war, when every shot it fires will cost a hundred
pounds or so. A prudent people clearly will ask " Can
we pay our shot?" before they set to fighting with five
or ten ton cannon-balls.
TIPPLE AND TENSION.
DRUNKENNESS may be caused otherwise than by
drinking "intoxicating liquors." Witness the usually
excited behaviour and violent language of the orators
and audience at meetings of the United Kingdom
Alliance. Moreover, an imprecation in common use

COMEADES IX QUOD.
AT a meeting of the Gas Stokers' Defence Aid Committee, held on
Saturday last week at a place in Bolt Court, Fleet Street, altogether
irrespectively of the memory of DB. JOHNSON, a speech was made
from the chair by MB. GEORGE POTTEB, wherein that gentleman—
"Called the attention of the meeting to the fact that the Memorial praying
for the mitigation of the sentence upon the five Gaa Stokers had been sent to
MB. Urn 11. as Home Secretary, on the "th intitant, and that not only had no
reply been received, but the receipt of the Memorial had not been acknow-
ledged. He considered it very uncourteoua."
If uncourteous is a word considered applicable to the abstinence
of the HOME SECRETARY from taking any notice of the Memorial
in favour of the convicted Gas Stokers, what epithet may he deemed
appropriate to the crime of which those convicts were giiilty in at-
tempting to plunge all London in darkness? Considering the
atrocities which, by success in so doing, they would have given the
dangerous classes occasion to infiict on the community, would it be
too much to call that attempt, dictated by a small and selfish motive,
diabolical?
MR. POTTEB, in concluding his observations, expressed the opinion
that:—
"The Government seemed bent upon doing all in its power to alienate the
Working Classes from giving it any support in the future."
By letting justice take its course with conspirators against public
safety, the Government will alienate from their supporters not the
"Working, but only the Striking Classes, except also the Thieving or
Predatory Classes. At the same time they may count on attracting
to their side all the Thinking and Law-Abiding Classes of the
country; thus, on the whole, very considerably adding to their
present majority.
Our friend MR. POTTEB was followed by a Gas Stoker named
DAVIS, who had just been let out of Coldbath-Fields Prison, in
which House of Correction he had been forced to spend six weeks for
leaving his employment at Bow Common without notice. MB. DAVIS
had b^ no means easily " brooked imprisonment." He had found it
very cold and uncomfortable,—it had not agreed with him at all:
hard labour had proved to be highly objectionable, and so had
companionship :—
"He and his fellow-workmen complained bitterly of being put to the same
sort of hard labour, under the same discipline, and being kept on the same
diet, as the convicted felons and thieves with whom he was obliged to
associate."
Than convicted thieves and felons certainly no companions can be
more unsuitable, and than the discipline and diet proper for them,
no keep and no treatment can be imagined more unmeet, for honest
Gas Stokers. But what of Gas Stokers who would, if they could,
have put out the light and let the thieves and felons loose on the
Public? Are the Scoundrels such very unfit associates in punish-
ment for the Stokers?
But come, England is yery good-natured, and her Ministers are
like unto her. The imprisoned Stokers have said that they are very
sorry for their offence (and we have no doubt that they ore yery
sorry for its results), and so MB. BRUCE proposes to remit two-thirds
of their punishment. Let them drink his health—moderately—in
BBETT'S Brandy, and let them take both the liquor and the lesson to
heart, as the "poor woman" does in the Beggar's Opera.
Popular Improvement.
A LOT of rough diamonds from South Africa was sold on Wednes-
day last week at the Mart of MESSRS. DEBF.NHAH AND STORK, in
Covent Garden. This sale took place at a special auction of those
gems which is held monthly at that establishment. Hence it
appears that the number of rough diamonds imported must be very
great. This is somewhat satisfactory to think upon, when we con-
sider what multitudes of Roughs there are amongst our population
in whose natures the Rough is all in all without any Diamond.

FLOUNCES' FIRE INSURANCE.
BY accounts from Vienna we learn that
a lady of hijrh rank and her daughter, at
Presburg, preparing to fro to a ball, very
narrowly escaped being burnt to death in
consequence of .the dress of the latter catch-
ing tire from a light on the floor, and
igniting thut of the former when she rushed
to her assistance. In the midst of life the
position of being liable at any moment to
leave it cannot be helped, but it is ladies'
own fault to go about in the midst of com-
1 bustible millinery, surrounded by a funeral-
pile, arranged as though on purpose to be in
constant readiness for burning them alive.
It is, moreover, a funeral-pile of which the
'materials are enormously expensive, so
much so as to make it worth any man's
i while to insure bis wife's dress, were that
possible, on every occasion when she goes
attired in anything like fashion, to an

those we love, however, it is rather to be

PAELIAMENTAEIA.
PHEASANT shooting being over, Parliament assembles again this
week, for the three hundred and thirty-first time since it rose like
a Phoenix from the expiring embers of the Saxon Wittenagemot.
Full details of the meeting of the first Parliament, and the speech
from the throne by KING ALFBBD THE GBEAT, in which he made a
touching reference to his recent sojourn in the Danish camp, will
be found in Doomsday-Book and other contemporary publications.
These are given partly in Anglo-Saxon, and partly in that Norman
French, of which traces still linger in modern parliamentary usage;
but dictionaries are kept on the premises, and the officials will be
found most obliging in explaining the contractions, and fitting a key
to the cipher in which the rest of the text is written.
It would occupy too much time and space to enumerate all the
more celebrated Parliaments, but Archieologists would never forgive
us if we omitted to mention that the first Reformed Parliament was
held after the Reformation.
The qualifications for a Member of Parliament have been consider-
ably modified. All that is now required is—that he should be
thoroughly acquainted with the history and geography of Great
Britain and its dependencies, the acts and policy of the different
administrations which have been in power since the fall of WOLSEY,
the lives of the Speakers, the contents of the Journals of the House,
Hansard?! Debates, and the architectural details, pictorial decora-
tions (including the processes of fresco and water-glass painting,
mosaicry, &c.), and lighting and ventilation of the Chamber in
which he is to sit, speak, hear, and cheer. The Civil Service Com-
missioners will cheerfully undertake to test the knowledge of Candi-
dates in these various branches of study, but at present there is no
compulsory examination.
The privileges of Members consist in exemption from parochial
offices, immunity from all tolls levied at turnpikes and bridges,
provided they make and subscribe, at the time of claiming relief, a
declaration in writing before a Master in Chancery that they are
legislators, hereditary or elective; an adequate supply of stationery
at the public expense (but not including stamps); and the right to
call a wherry at any point on the Thames, whenever either House is
sitting between the hoars of 4 A.M. and 4 P.M.
The SPEAKEB speaks for himself. His office is of considerable
antiquity and dignity, but it is not hereditary: and his wig is
required to be in strict accordance with a sealed pattern deposited in
the Patent Offioe. Every Member presents the SPEAKEB with his
photograph and address card when he first enters the House, with a
portion of bride-cake when he marries, and with a copy of valedictory
verses when he vacates his seat. The SPEAKER is entitled to a pair
of white kid gloves whenever there is No House, and it is the duty
of the principal door-keeper to ascertain exactly the size which each
new Speaker takes. He spends his vacations in a delightful retreat
in a most romantic spot, in the heart of the Chiltern Hundreds.
Every other schoolboy knows the intimate connection that exists
between the Mace and the British Constitution, and the serious
consequences which might arise if that emblem of authority were lost
or mislaid. A majority of the Judges are of opinion that the Habeas
Corpus Act could not be legally suspended, or the provisions of the
Mutiny Act put into force. Nobody, therefore, will be surprised to
hear that the Sergeant-at-Arms always sleeps with the Mace by his
beclside, and awakes at least once in the course of the night to
satisfy himself that it is safe. When the Mace has to be cleaned,
a jury, composed of Members of the Goldsmiths' Company, is im-
panneled.
The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod can claim a new Rod with
every fresh Parliament. It must be cut from a tree standing in one
of the Royal Forests, and brought by a special mounted messenger
to the principal entrance to the House of Lords, where the Royal
Purveyor of Canes and Walking-sticks is bound to be in waiting to
receive and prepare it for official use within the precincts. The old
Rod must be burnt in a wood fire without being broken up, and the
ashes thrown into the Exchequer.
The earliest Blue Book of which we have any certain account,
contained the reports of the detective officers who were employed
by the Government on the occasion of the Gunpowder Plot. An
interesting calculation has been made that if all the Blue Books
which have been issued were heaped up one upon another, they
would form a pile as high as Mont Blanc; and it is estimated that
to read them through would occupy a man ten hours a day (Sun-
days excluded) for one hundred and sixteen years, seven months,
and thirteen days.

I see at the present day, to compensate for
all sorts of increased troubles and expenses,
is a great variety of comforts and conve-
niences in gutta percha and India-rubber."
Parliament, the benches are re-stuffed and re-covered. In the
Upper House the LOBD CHANCELLOR'S Upper Housemaid super-
intends the charwomen selected for this duty; in the Lower, a
superior domestic from the SPEAKER'S establishment discharges the
same office. They are both paid by fees, and have the privilege of
introducing a friend into the Strangers' Gallery. Formerly the char-
women were selected by the Housekeeper, preference being given to
the female relatives of non-commissioned officers in the Army and
Navy. But now, before they can be appointed, they must
obtain a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners; and
are therefore called upon, in the first instance, to furnish the most
minute information as to their age, family connections, places of
education, previous employments, health, character, private pursuits,
and freedom from pecuniary embarrassment, and then to undergo a
competitive examination in BLACKSTONE'S Commentaries, HAIXAM'S
(.''•iii>titntii>n<il History of England, Physical Geography, and one

The cellars underneath the Houses of Parliament being very
roomy and commodious, it is understood that a plan is under the
consideration of the First Commissioner of Works and Public
Buildings for lessening the annual expenses of the establishment by
letting these vaults to Wine Merchants of established reputation and
liberal principles, at a remunerative rent.
Cheap Defence of Nations.
WE are afraid to resist Russian progress in India, are we? No-
thing will be done by the British Government to that end which

Little do you know the spirit of this great nation. Going to war is,
for us, a mere affair of money. Ministers have no reason to fear
that this consideration will make war, if necessary, unpopular.
The People will not have to bear the expense of war. That will all
of it be defrayed by means of the Income-tax. It will therefore fall
only on privileged persons, and in nowise concern the community at
large. Who's afraid?

GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS!
GENTLEMEN, distinctly such. Not you others. Not you who
subordinate all other objects to making money. Not you, mere

them scenery and every other mortal thing. Not you, Members for
Mammon. Gentlemen, properly so called. You will shortly be
applied to for leave to destroy about a mile of beauty on the bank of
the Thames opposite to Hampton Court. In place thereof you will
be invited to sanction the erection of a high, blank, ugly wall. It
is said that the Chelsea Water Company are going to ask you for
permission to construct waterworks which will necessitate this
outrage. It is certain that they could construct other waterworks
which would render it unnecessary. At one of the numerous and
influential meetings lately held by the indignant inhabitants of
Thames Ditton, Long Hit tun, and Kingston, to protest against, and
try and prevent it, the fact was (you may read it in the Morning
Pott) "pointed out that the land proposed to be taken for the
reservoirs is of great value, both as meadow and for building pur-
poses, while close to the proposed intake there is abundance of suit-
able space that might be appropriated without loss to any one,
though it is admitted it would cost more for excavation." And,
Gentlemen, merely that this additional cost may be shirked, you will
be requested to permit " one of the prettiest bits of river-scenery in
England" to be ruined.
Dear Gentlemen, sweet Gentlemen, good Gentlemen, honourable,
really and truly, and not merely nominally honourable Gentlemen;
surely you will not suffer the barbarity of replacing the prospect
from the window 9f the Mitre with a hideous eyesore. Of course
not if you know it. But mind lest this Vandalism be managed
without your knowledge. Watch, be on the look-out, keep your
eyes open, and see that a Private Bill, under the name of a Chelsea
Waterworks Bill, but being also a Thames Ditton and Hampton
Court Abomination Bill, is not smuggled through your honourable
House. Representatives of decent constituencies, show an active
sympathy with people at Hampton Court, the Dittons. and King-
ston, of the same description. Also with the many thousands of
similar Londoners represented by the undersigned. Let not a lovely
landscape fall into the hands of the Philistines.
I am, Gentlemen, yours respectfully, an habitual
EXCURSIONIST.

(The Two Aruspices.)
IN Rome, ere the ('omitia
To business could be set,
The Angora and Aruspioes
In solemn conclave met;
The packings, pipings, Loppings
Of the sacred fowls to try,
And in the victim's entrails
For signs of fate to pry.
'Twaa the Augur's solemn duty
To keep the cocks and hens,
Who, like an ahle Editor,
Dropped presage from their pens;
And as by British Parties
Leading articles are feared,
So these oracles in hen-coops
By Home's statesmen were revered.
On pig's, sheep's, and ox' "innards,"
Now we have come to look,
More as a source of sausage-meat
Than as the future's book;
For Poultry-shows, not Parties,
Our cocks and hens we feed,
And the canard's the only fowl
That Politicians breed.
So Augurs and Aruspices
No colleges have now;
At least, beneath these titles,
No more to them we bow;
But High-priests of both orders
Are here, though less in view,
"Who, oracular as they are,
Know the future as they knew.
Bat Rome had daring sceptics
Who of myst'ries foul would fall,
Style Augurs and Aruspices
Sheer humbugs, one and all:
Swear only geeae to poultry
For oracles would go;
In entrails owned "amenta,"
But " omina "—0, no!
'Twas CATO who the mouthpiece
Of these scoffers dared to be-
Some HUXLEY of the period,
Or DEAN STANLEY, p'raps, was he—
WHO SAID HE ALWAYS WONDERED
Two ABUSPICS COULD EMBHACF,
WITHOUT BURSTING our A-LAUGHING
EACH IN T'OTHER'S BBAZEN FACE:
0, Aruspics of our Parties,
Who, without their staff and gown,
Profess to read the future,
And forecast its smile or frown,
P'rhaps CATO, were he living,
Would wonder how you came
Together without laughing,
For the "Session's" little game.
The presages recalling
Put forth in days gone by,
The portents, signs, and omens
Interpreted awry:
The trust in lights misleading,
Croaks, crowings, both misread—
And the Party's tail, still going
Hap-hazard, like its Head:
The sources sought for guidance,
Whence guidance ne'er could come;
Dumb beasts and blind birds questioned,
Where manly voice was dumb;
The sham shrines you have bowed to,
The oracles you 've sought,
Knowing the altar godless,
The inspiration nought.
The plenteousness of promise,
And the performance small:' •
The length of the yarn-spinning,
The bandying of the bawl:
The pledging of the pledges,
The shirking of the same:
The shuffling of the old, old cards,
For the same old, old game.
Yes; wondrous is your face-power,
Aruspies, who can meet,
VIII Post Nonas Febrnarias,
Abreast of Downing Street-
Can meet for our Comitia,
And yet forbear to chaff,
Nor wake the official echoes
Of Whitehall with your laugh.

Though sterner MEaHYrEBBLius

But, for all he looks BO solemn,
No less he twigs the fan,
E'en while his brow on DIZZIUS
Appears to frown " Ha' done!"

Extend beyond his sleeve.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(Still among " The Old Masters." He gets as far as Number Sixty -
Eight, and then addresses the Editor as usual.)
You left me. Sir, oeatec
in Gallery No. I. I do
not, as Your Representa-
tive at a theatre, sit in
the Gallery, but at Bur-
lington House, you will
understand, this is un-
avoidable. You will not
be thought the worse oi
because /was in this Gal-
lery. There are, of course,
some Galleries where I
would not be seen, and
gome where, whether as
Your Representative or
not, I would. As in-
stances of the latter, let
me name the Gallery of
both Houses of Parlia-
ment, the Whispering Gal-
lery at St. Paul's, and the
Gallery of Illustration,
Regent Street. At thea-
tres, to be among the
Olympian deities, with
Jupiter in his shirt-
sleeves, Juno sucking:
oranges, Venus Gong be-
fore her bath), her gaudy
bonnet tied on to the rail in front, indulging in light and elegant
badinage with a shining, well-larded, and carefully-waxed Mars,
while Ganymede hands round the pewter filled from the cart supplied
by a neighbouring Bacchus Hop-timus, whose house, by order of
Lycurgus, must be closed at midnight—to sit in such a Gallery of
Gods is neither to my taste nor to yours; and anyone catching
sight of me so placed, has, I admit, a right to adapt the French
Question to my English understanding by asking me, "What the
deuce are you doing in that Gallery?"
"From such dreams of thee I arose," as the poet would, perhaps,
have said, had he not written it differently, putting the vero in the
present tense first, and omitting the adjective; but there's ne saying
what a poet might or might not do. At all events, in brief, I arose
from my seat, and having, out of compliment to the artistic Genius
Loci, drawn myself up to my full length—I mean height—I paused
for one moment to see if I was " the observed of all observers." Sir,
I was not. This was enough for me, and I at once proceeded with
my task. I had determined to make my visit rather of the butter-
fly touch-and-go kind than to drain the buttercup to the dregs. If
you don't like my poetic similes, you can pass them on. Your
neighbour's taste may not be yours. I own that, as Your Repre-
sentative, I do go about dropping pearls and diamonds from my lips
like the enchanted maiden; and the enchanted maidens are down
on them at once, as though I were STORR AND MOBTIMEB gone luna-
tic, and giving jewels away; but, with these exceptions, I know not
before whose snout they fall. I address myself to You, Sir, as a
model of all that is But no matter; models are not pictures,
and so, as I said before, to my task.
I was first stopped by Mrs, Drummond Smith, No. 14, painted
by GEORGE ROMNET, and lent by the MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON.
It represents a lady with a hat like a paper fire-balloon collapsed in
its descent upon her head. The sudden shock has made her hair
turn grey.
"And when UDOLPHO saw her locks thus grey,
He wond'ring gazed, nor had one word to say"—
—which would have been my case to a camel's hair had not my eye
caught DOBSON'S Portrait Group just above—evidently placed there
by some one with a keen appreciation of the humorous in the fit-
ness of things. _ The Three Gentlemen here portrayed are discussing
the balloon accident below, and explaining now it happened. The
argument appears to have been a warm one, as they are in their
shirt-sleeves, made, however, of silk.
No. 17. Portrait of the Son. Henry Erskine, Lord Advocate of
Scotland.—SB seems to be weary of his own arguments in favour of
Scotland, and the Court (myself) is not with him, as I am an advo-
cate for England as a residence.
No. 21. Portrait of Mrs. Frederick Hemming.—"Hemming!
She's not even sewing! *' said my friend WASG, who had drawn
my attention to this picture on purpose to let off this joke. I said,
"Tush!" and brr jd the dust off my coat-sleeve at him. For-
tunately he obsei veu an acquaintance in a far corner, and was off
immediately to bring him to see No. 21, and hear his new conceit.
Conceit 1 Ha! I should think so.
No. 35.—0, Miss LDTLET, afterwards MRS. SHERIDAN, how lovely
you are! 0, THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH, THOMAS GATNSBOHOUGH. 0!
And if BARON LIONEL DE ROTHSCHILD, M.P., ever wishes to offer a
testimonial to one who knows nothing whatever about him, and for
no particular object, let him send the picture, carriage-paid, to the
residence of Your Representative, who, as his petitioner, will never
cease to pray, at convenient times, &c., &o. Not much less could I
say of
No. 49. Mrs. C. Smith, of Aithernie.—She is Carmichael-Smyth
in the Catalogue. But Smyth will ever be Smith to me, and a Rose
as Rosse will smell as sweet; just as a Thistle, if called a Geranium,
would still be a Thistle to any donkey, Scotch-wise or otherwise.
No. 56. Portrait of Madame Saccelli, Dancer, who, with a whole
box of rouge on her cheeks, and painted eyes and forehead, might
i>e, in age, the number of her picture; and this number would pos-
sibly suggest to the apocryphal—no, I mean the Apocalyptic—
DB. CUM .in MI. , one with which he has proved himself very_ familiar.
57. A Hunting Scene, by Geo. Morland.—Like a sustained piano
note on a wind instrument, it is long and low.
Entering Gallery the Second, I found the picture of a Japanese
ady in Kensington Gardens during a London fog. She is dis-
iguring the trees, in the absence of the officials. This is labelled
STo. 59. Tolle, lege. Ite Capellte—which was translated by an
aspiring classic, "Go to Chapel," which he intended as a correction
on the original mistaken reading, "Go it, ye Cripples!"
Hush! not a word. See me, Sir, representing You, stealing on
ip-toe up'to No. 63, by SMTRKE, R.A. (delicious Thackerayan name
. or a painter!), and watch me as I stand amazed before that eminent
artists picture of "Ghosts Disturbed at Play," but which is cun-
ningly catalogued (so as not to frighten the timid) as The Nut-
"ratherers.
While in this almost reverential mood, I came upon No. 68, by
JARTOLOME ESTEBAN MURILLO, which I hold to be a good mouth-
ul, and altogether better than BOB SMIRKE, R.A. No doubt BAU-
TOLOME ESTEBAN MUBILLO knew what a good dinner was as well as
any one, and the specimens in this Gallery (arranged evidently by
Jhe same person or persons whose humorous sense of fitness I noticed
n No. I.) would go far to prove it.
I should say also that he often took his dinner at a Restaurant,
vhither he was compelled in consequence of the trouble caused him
iy his own domestics. Now, while dining at this Restaurant one
day, it occurred to B. E. MUBILLO, whose servants had, as usual,
^rambled at having to feed occasionally on cold meat, "like," they
mpudently said, oats," to give them a lesson.with his brush.
These were, be it remembered, not only old Times, but good old
Times; and so the Old Master,'who had left the Old Missus at home
» have it out with the Cook, at once hit upon a subject from Sacred
listory as parabolically fitted for conveying the moral he had in
riew. The idea developed into Abraham Entertaining the Angels
No. 68). He worked the notion out thoroughly with a cold leg of
n utton and a large mince-pie, both probably from models in his own
arder. Over the patriarch's arm he placed the likeness of the
waiter's napkin, and thus intimated that the Master of the feast
was himsell obliged to dine at the Restaurants. Such I take to be

the moral of No. 68. It evidently reformed the household, as in
No. 65 BABTOLOME ESTEBAN MUBILLO paid his servants a compli-
ment which they most have highly appreciated after the rebuke
conveyed in the former picture. No. 68 is, as I have said, Abraham
Entertaining the Angels, and No. 65 is La Cutting des Anaes, So

P.S.—I 've just seen an advertisement wherein the Alhambra
management announces that there is now " Increased comfort and
warmth. Draughts entirely stopped." Glad to hear the subject
has been so soon ventilated. Your Representative wrote to you,
Sir, in Christmas week on that current-of-air topic in those Alham-
hra Stalls. "Nobody knows," perhaps, as Miss KATHEBINE SANTLET
knows, but everyone feels as I feel—about draughts. Let our ears
be stopped by CLAY (nothing more pleasant) but not by wool, in
dread of, or in consequence of, rheumatic neuralgic aches and
pains. I "11 catch a tune with anyone any day of the week, but

under the direction of MB. YOUNG, is to appear at the Charing Cross

A Plain Question.
"Mount, daring warbler! that love-prompted strain
('Twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond)
Thrills not the less the bosom of the plain."
CAN any naturalist or psychologist explain why the song of the
skylark (according to these lines of WOBDSWOBTH) should produce
such peculiar emotions in the breast of persons of unprepossessing
appearance?
"IF I WERE A DONKEY."
IF I were a Donkey, I wouldn't go
In deputation to tackle BOB LOWE;
For he 'd hit me hard, and he 'd cry, "No go!
Go home, Neddy!"
He 'd floor my fallacies with a flout;
He 'd knock my facts and figures about;
First show me up, and then show me out,
With a " Go home, Neddy !."
You can't persuade him that black is blue,
Nor that one and one make three, not two:
Nor that sauce for goose won't for gander do—
Nor that I 'm not Neddy!
When BBIGGS he talked about " higher laws,"
BOD was down upon him with teeth and claws,
And pinned poor BRIGGS to his "why" and " because,"

And proves they 're Neddies.

His bottle for Deputations to drink,
Is filled from Truth's well, and it makes you wink,

Well, in these soft times, more smooth than sooth,
There's a virtue in disagreeable truth,
And to tell it, sans phrase, my BOB'S the youth,

NUliSEEl" RHYME FOR 1I.U.U. PRINCE ALFRED.
Hi diddle diddle,
The Duke and the Fiddle.
PETTICOATS IN PABLIAMENT.
PLEASE, dear Mr. Punch, will you use your powerful\ influence to
procure for us poor ladies some better seats in Parliament? Oi
course we don't aspire'ai present to have regular Members' seats, but
I do think it a great shame that we should all be huddled up so in
that nasty horrid bird-cage of a Gallery, where nobody can see us or
admire our pretty dresses. I'm sure our presence would serve
vastly to enliven the debates, if we only were made visible: and it
would be so jolly just to catch the SPEAKER'S eye, and make him
blush, poor man, as he called us all to order! Only see how
famously the ladies are treated at Versailles—but then, of course,
you know, the French are perfect models of politeness:—
"Asa rule, it is a severe trial for one's gallantry to see, especially on a
Jeld-day, the Chamber swarming with ladies in the best seats, many of whom
come, not through the slightest degree of intelligent interest in the debates,
nit for the fun of the railway journey backwards and forwards, and as they
night go to a church or an ordinary theatre to exhibit and compare toilettes.
[ noticed to-day that one lady had brought her bonne, whose plain cap stood
>nt with highly picturesque effect from among the bonnets of the front row.
Che ladies, in fact—owing, let us hope, to French gallantry, not to French
nvolity—are pretty nearly omnipotent in the Chamber, getting as many of
the best seats as they like.'
There now, fancy that! Imagine what a f ass there would be in
>ur Parliament, if we poor ladies all petitioned to be served like our
French sisters! Yon men pretend to love us and admire us and all
hat, but when will you ever dream of letting us become " omni-
xrtent" in Parliament? As for giving your best seats to us, of
course, that's too much to expect, though I 'm sure that we should
aake the House look vastly prettier. Only think how nice the front
>enches would look, if filled with gay costumes instead of dowdy
Toaduloth 1 And those odious black chimney-pots which men will
persist in wearing even in the House, how much nicer it would be
were they all banished to the back, and if the front rows were re-
served for elegant new bonnets 1
Of course, poor ladies can't expect just yet to use their tongues in
a debate, but there could surely be no harm if we might use our eyes
a bit. '• Now you know the use of ladies' eyes is not merely to see
with, but also to be looked at; and I 'm sure this latter use would
help us very sensibly to influence a debate, although we took no oral
part in it. A man would never venture to make a stupid speech if
he beheld a formidable row of laughing eyes all ready to make fun
of him; and not even MK. AYRTON would dare to speak uncivilly,
when there were ladies present, with flashing eyes all levelled to
shoot out angry glances at him.
Hoping, therefore, soon to have a proper seat in Parliament, and
not be cooped up in the bird-cage, as though I were a parrot, I
remain, dear Mr. Punch, your weekly reader and adorer,
AMT ARABELLA ANNE.
P.S.—I 'm sure that English ladies are quite capable of taking an
"intelligent interest" in debates, and would never dream of going
there "for fun," for Parliament has grown so sternly serious 01 late
that now-a-days there's never any fun in English politics.

OUB respected Catholic contemporary, the Tablet, is somewhat
exercised because Mr. Punch ventured, in the most good-natured
manner to suggest that his Holiness the POPE (of whom Mr. Punch
never speaks or thinks disrespectfully) might have told certain
Roman children a better story than that of the alleged discovery of
the bones of 88. Philip and Jacob. Now it was precisely because the
POPE is notoriously gifted with humour, as well as other fine quali-"
ties, that Mr. Punch made the observation, and a candid Catholic
should have perceived a compliment to the Head of his Church. But
the Tablet objects to Mr. Punch's mode of spelling a certain name.
Mr. P. is not greatly troubled on this, as he has referred to DB.
WILLIAM SMITH (a better authority than the whole Sacred College
put together), and finds that in the memoir of 8. 1'hilip the name is
spelt by the learned SMITH as Mr. Punch spelt it. The great point
made by the Tablet is, unluckily, its weakest. It asserts that it
was the Lesser S. James whose remains were brought to Home. If
the Saint is the lesser, the miracle is the bigger. For whereas it is
known where Great S. James was buried, Catholic writers are
divided in opinion as to whether the Lesser James was interred in
the Valley of Jehoshaphat, or in the Mount of Olives. But it equally
happened five hundred years before the foundation of the Church
where the relics are supposed to be. The Tablet says "it is be-
lieved" that they were translated. Well, it is not believed by
rational persons. But let difference of belief never alter friendship;
and Mr. Punch blots the Tablet's unkindness from the tablets of
liis memory.
A Preference Pedigree.
I HAD rather be the descendant of SIR THOMAS LUCY than SHAK-
SPEABE'S. As the former 1 should boast of a good old English pedi-
gree; and there would be no invidious comparison drawn between
me and my ancestor.

[FEBBUABY 15, 1873.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
We are very much obliged to the German Emperor, and to the
Tribunal at Geneva.
[Sovereigns should be polite, your Majesty, but really
Extradition Treaty with Kiire OF THE BELGIANS.
New Commercial Treaty with France is in hand.
England and Russia agree that the northern frontier of Afghan-
istan should be defined. There has been correspondence on
the topic.
[By the way, your Majesty, it seems to occur to nobody
that on the whole the Afghani themselves might
just be asked where they think their country ends.
The Estimates will be as moderate as possible, considering how
high certain prices are.
Harvest somewhat deficient, bat trade, revenue, and decrease of
pauperism and crime generally satisfactory.
A measure will be submitted for settling the question of Uni-
versity Education in Ireland.
[" Heard ye the din of battle-bray,
Lance to lance, and horse to horse f"
Many measures which you have already considered, you will be
good enough to consider again. Specially,°you must create
a Supreme Court of Judicature. Also, you will hear of
proposals
For making Land Transfer easier.
For amending Local Taxation.
[ The only remark on this, your Majesty, w "Ah!"
For amending the Education Act of 1870.
[Another exclamation would be pardonable here,
your Majesty, but Mr. Punch is as polite as
any Sovereign.
For amending Railway and Canal Law.
The Speech ended with a Prayer for the Highest Guidance and
Favour; and MR. DISRAELI, at the end of his speech on the Address,
expressed his opinion that never were these more needed than now.
LORD CLARENDON (once the " little LORD HYDE, with his Chewtor,"
of one of TIIACKBRAY'S Irish Ballads) moved the Address in the
Lords. He introduced a graceful reference to the death of the
EKPEROB NAPOLEON, and, after a brief sketch of the topics of the
Speech, modestly expressed a fear that with almost unparalleled
effrontery he had ventured " to rush in where angels fear to tread."
We like a young gentleman to quote, but LORD CLARENDON is no
fool, and we are not aware that any angels in particular have been
deterred from making remarks on Geneva and Trinity College,
Dublin.
LORD MoNTEAGLE seconded with ability and conciseness, and said
"he should rejoice as an Irishman " if the Education question were
duly settled. We have seen Irishmen rejoice in a very demonstra-
tive way, and have shared their rejoicings; but he ought not to have
threatened this in the presence of the Bishops. Still, he has pre-
cedent in the case of the Blameless King, in Tom Thumb—
"To-night
It is our royal pleasure to be drunk,
And this our Queen ahall be as drunk as we."
The EARL or DERBY, having complimented his young friends on
the talent and moderation of their orations, thought the description
of the state of the country rather rose-coloured, considering that the
battle between Capital and Labour was never fiercer. Our income
had increased, but it was because we imbibed, more, in fact " we
had drunk ourselves out of the American difficulty. The Irish
Press was gagged, and a tremendous Coercion Act was ready to the
Viceroy's hand, so we can hardly talk of improved good feeling
in Ireland. He hoped the Irish Education question would be
settled, but anything that would satisfy the Dominant Hierarchy
would offend the rest of us, and would certainly not find ita way
up to the Lords. (Will He Clear It f) He heartily welcomed LORD
SELBORNE, and hoped, rather than expected, that he would accom-
plish law reform. That sea was strewn with wrecks. He trusted
the Zanzibar business was not to get us into all sorts of messes, and
that the Afghanistan business did not mean the extension of our
frontier. He suggested that by a Government blander the St. Juan
decision, which might have been in our favour, was necessarily
adverse. Emphatically, there was nothing to be congratulatory about,
as regarded the Washington Treaty. The Americans would never
have gone to war for that money, and we certainly have not made
them better friends by allowing them to outwit us. Moreover, we
have enacted a |most mischievous set {of new Rules. However, he
was glad to hear that the Speech menaced nothing of a violent or
revolutionary character.
[ On the whole, the criticism can hardly be called gushing, or
even affectionate, my Lord.
The Foreign Secretary, LORD GRiNviLLE, after warning his
young friends that the display of such talents entitled the House to
look for their future exercise, intimated that he considered LORD
DERBY'S speech as a Wet Blanket. Mr. Punch's Cartoon of
"Humble Pie " seems to have occurred to LORD GRANVILLE, and he
objected to the charge that the dish in question had been consumed.
He answered LORD DERBY with considerable adroitness, on most
points, but people want to know what the Foreign Minister had to
say about Russia and India. Well, it is this, and when you have
read it, Mr. Punch will only softly say, with the Silent Woman
(before she breaks out as a termagant), "Judge yon, forsooth,"
which word is the Saxon forsothe, and is much used by weak
vessels, who think that it sounds nobly indignant.
"If a party Bays ' forsooth,'
Please knock out that party's tooth."
We are not frivolous—we are keeping away from an unpleasant fact.
However, out it must come. LORD GHANVILLB stated that the late
LORD CLARENDON declared that the Afghanistan line ought to be
drawn, and told Russia so. Russia talked and talked, and nothing
was done. LOBD GRANVILLE took the same view, told Russia so,
and Russia allowed that it was right, but objected to the line being
drawn as England desired. Bat the St. Petersburg Government
assures m that nothing like that ought to be a cause of quarrel, and
LORD GRANVILLE is so sure of the CZAR'S good intentions that he
begs we will believe all is right. Bat, the fact stands that two
British Foreign Ministers have demanded the line since 1S59, and it
is not drawn in 1873.
LORDS SALISBURY and CAIRNS had hard things to say on the
American question. The latter highly eulogised SIR ALEXANDER
COCKBURN'S statement of the case, on which MR. LOWE had been
petulant, but it would be remembered when his "financial eccentri-
cities" should be forgotten.
The LORD CHANCELLOR'S maiden speech was then delivered, but
it was nearly restricted to an argument that the Arbitrators' Rules
introduced no new principles of law, and that we were not bound by
any mere propositions advanced in discussion at Geneva.
The DUKE OF RICHMOND then castigated the Government and a
good many other persons, and when he wis tired, we suppose. His
Grace left eff. Anyhow, he left off, and that was the main thing,
though we did not get to dinner till past nine, which is too late. Of
course, the Address was agreed to.
In the House of Commons, MR. GLADSTONE was loudly applauded,
and when Ms. DISRAELI came in he was markedly cheered from
both sides, and there is no need to remind any one what that greeting
signified. The House of Commons is, for the present at all events,
an assembly of Gentlemen, and not " a habitation for Zim and Jim
and every unclean thing."
Very many notices were given, and several of our old friends are
to the front with their accustomed absurdities, whereof, and with
the movers thereof, let us hope to make good sport, literary and
pictorial, when the blunders blossom.
"When the child is man, we burn the rod,"
says MR. BROWSING; but some children will not grow np, and so
Mr. Punch's rod remains uuoonsumed, and pickled in pure malt
vinegar. Perhaps he may try a little Tunding on the more heinous
offenders, and make them " galled geese of Winchester."
MR. LYTTLETON (East Worcestershire) moved, and MR. STONE
(Portsmouth) seconded the Address. Both did credit to themselves,
the latter gentleman especially distinguishing himself as anything
but a stone of stumbling.
MR. DISRAELI remarked on the preponderance of Foreign Affairs
in the Speech, and approved this. The House should remember
that it was not only a Vestry, but a Senate. But he went at once
to the Irish Education item, and remarking sarcastically on the diffi-
culty of reconciling the advancement of learning with the rights of
"conscience," hoped that the promise did not only mean the sacri-
fice of a famous and learned University to substitute for it the
mechanical mediocrity of an Examining Board. He thought the
last (secular) paragraph had been drawn up by somebody who had
studied all the vagrant rhetoric of the recess. That was a safety-
valve; butjrecees talk should be regarded as the autumn foliage. We
ought to get to business in serious fashion. But he saw small chance
of this, after the programme. We should have hurry-scurry debates,
helter-skelter legislation, and a terrible July. Then, at consider-
able length he censured things generally, but added that Russia had
a right to try to get at the sea, as this way only could she feed her
people, and supply raw material for industry. But if she tried more
than this, she must be resisted. Her idea of seizing Constantinople
was a freak of ambition; her attempt to conquer India a dis-
tempered dream.
MR. HORSSIAN was cleverly bitter about America, but was as
cleverly told by MR. BKRNAL OSBORNE that his speech should have
been made last year. MR. WHITE said something offensive about
the builders of the Alabama, for which Mn. LAIBD promptly called

COMPROMISE WITHOUT CONCESSION.
THE orthodox defenders of the Athanasian Creed,
how zealous soever, may yet be said, in holding their
late meeting at St. James's Hall and the Hanover Square
Rooms in two parts simultaneously, to have been doing
things by halves. That, however, is a remark to which,
as it may seem to savour of buffoonery, they will perhaps
not be_ disposed to pay any very serious attention. They
were, in reality, most enthusiastic, their numbers were
very great, their respectability was the highest, and,
as the Post, in commenting on their assembly, truly
says:—
"The intelligence of the vast audience is to be taken into
account."
Yes; and it must have been considerably above the
average if they were capable of understanding the Creed
of St. Athanasius. Of course they are capable of under-
standing it who really believe it. Equally, of course,
those who really disbelieve it can understand it too.
May there not, though, be very many people who believe
that they believe it, and also, perhaps, as many who
believe that they disbelieve it, and are all of them on
both sides alike mistaken P Do not they, together, con-
stitute the vast majority? Do the English words of the
Athanasian Creed, translated, convey to their minds any
ideas that would not in truth be as effectually con-
veyed, even to those the least learned, by the original
Quicunque vult t Now this question seems to suggest a
way out of a controversy which may be thought to afford
a great deal too much amusement to Papists and Dis-
senters. Could not (''(invocation ask Parliament to allow
the creed of St. Athanasius, exceptionally, to be recited
in Latin? By this expedient very much would be done
to prevent the possibility of any contention as to its
meaning. Those who hold by the Athanasian Creed
would be assured that they heard its genuine version,
and, as for the rest, it would offend the ears of very few,
whilst then also it would really and truly be read no
more at all than it is now in " a tongue not understanded
of the people."

him to account, and elicited the declaration that ;MR. WHITE had
not meant to assail that gentleman.
Ma. GLADSTONE, after compliments to the new speakers, and a
becoming and respectful reference to MR. DISRAELI'S bereavement,
instinctively applied himself to the Irish Education question (" Heard
ye the din .' " etc.} as that on which battle must come. He declared
that the advancement of learning in Ireland was not irreconcileable
with the sanctity of rights of conscience. The task would be diffi-
cult, but he relied on the support of Parliament, and favourable
construction. He thought we ought to regard Russia's expedition
to Khiva as we should have insisted on our own into Abyssinia being
regarded. Dae care would be taken of our commercial interests in
dealing with France. He then replied to MR. DISRAELI on the
American question, and contended that though we had, of course,
gained no certainty of perpetual peace, we had brought a very large
number of irritating matters to a peaceful issue, and he believed
that, on the whole, this nation took the right view of the business,
unpleasant as it might be to hand over money.
MR. HARDY and MR. VERNON HARCOURT spoke; and the CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER denied that he had meant to be rude to
3ra Ai,i:\A.\nnn COCKBURN. But he (MR. LOWE) had a sincere
lorror and detestation of war, which arbitration prevented, but
ndgment should be given without reasons.
LORD BURY thought Canada had been hardly treated, and had at
.east deserved kindly mention in the Speech. SIR S. NORTHCOTE
said that Canada had not been ill-treated at all. He knows.
The Address was agreed to, and we went away about half-past
eleven.
There, Madam, for whom Mr. Punch, with pride and humility
lixed) usually distils this Ess. Parl. Bouquet! He has felt it his
luty, in recording the opening night, to be slightly instructive,
Because he wishes you to understand the position of Men and (Jues-
iona. But he promises you that in the future, you shall have less
>f the Parliament talk and more of his own delightful epigrams,
which are 'your pride and joy and chief delight—apples of gold in
pictures of silver—fire-flies tangled in a silver braid. There will be
some fun this Session, Madam, and perhaps wigs on the green.
Friday.—" They have been at a great feast of languages, and have
stolen the scraps," says one of SHAKSPEARE'S characters. To-night
members seem to have come in, like good little children, to eat up
the dessert. Numbers of small speeches, on the topics of last night,
were made. Nothing worth note was said, except that MR. GLAD-
STONE, being questioned as to the course of legislature, wisely said
that he had learned by experience " to do one thing at a time."
So, to adapt SHAXSPEARK again, "Goto, now for your one thing
which yon will do.'1
REGISTRAR-GENERALISATION.
A "GREEN YULE" has ceased to make "a fat churchyard."
Weather which is " muggy " and " unseasonable" no longer favours
the diffusion of zymotic diseases. These conclusions are drawn by
the Deputy-Registrar from figures afforded by the experience of this
one past year. Is that exactly the way to reason, medical gentle-
men and philosophers? Suppose that in a given district, undrained,
the death-rate during a certain space of time, had, comparatively
to that of ud joining drained districts, declined. Would you jump to
the conclusion that cesspools are salubrious? Are we quite sure that
we have not just passed through a season exceptional from unascer-
tained causes, which, in its extraordinary effects on the Public
Health, have constituted it the exception which proves the rule?
HARD TIMES.
MR. PUNCH once gave a memorable word of advice " To Persons
about to Marry." He feels it to be his duty now to repeat it with a
seasonable addition—" Don't"—until coals are cheaper.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ST. VALENTINE STYLITES.
MR. Poxcn BEOS TO SUGGEST TO THE POWERS THAT BE, THAT THE LORD
CHAMBERLAIN, IN THE CAPACITY OF CENSOR, SHOULD HAVE HIS POWER EXTENDED
TO THE EXAMINATION, EXPURGATION, AND, IF NECESSARY, REJECTION OF VALEN-
TINES. WORTHY AND COMPETENT OFFICERS COULD BE STATIONED AT ALL POST-
OFFICES, PILLAR-BOXES, &C., FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING INVESTIGATIONS.
SABBATARIANS ON STRIKE.
AT a meeting held the other day at Merthyr by Welsh
Colliers on strike (bless them!), in the course of a speech
made, according to the Times, by one HALLIDAY :—
"A copy of the Illustrated Nftci of Saturday last was pro-
duced, and an illustration representing a dog-fight ai the Sunday
occupation of Welsh Colliers was denounced with great emphasis,
which was endorsed by the meetiug."
Religions and sensitive Welsh Colliers oonld not bnt
resent the imputation of being used to divert themselves
with dog-fighting on Sundays. Yet there is something
to be said for the contemplation of dog-fighting on any
day whatsoever, if not on Sunday especially :—
"Let dogs delight to bark and bite."
The best of reasons is assigned by DR. WATTS for
letting them; and therefore also it might be argued that
what dogs are constituted to delight in doing men may
properly delight to see. But sophistry apart, undoubt-
edly the Welsh Colliers on strike could spend Sunday
better than in attending dog-fi?hts. Works of necessity
are acknowledged even by Sabbatarians to be lawful on
Sunday; and, considering the coal-famine which those
colliers are wickedly inflicting on the community, thus
depriving people of a necessary >f life, they might
perceive that they would act like Christians, and not
otherwise, in choosing that day whereon to return to their
work. The better the day the better the deed. There
cannot he a better day than Sunday for doing the work
of repentance. At present these pious fellows are keep-
ing every day as a Sabbath, or in other words keeping a
Sabbath sine die. Not only on the First Day of the Week
are they doing no manner of work, but they remain
equally idle on every other.
Confessio Amantis.
I 'VK often loved a dear Gazelle
(By which I mean a maiden fair,)
For her I 've purchased from HIMM^L
A Valentine most gay and rare.
And on its beauty she has smiled.
It was so sweet she could not choose,
Then said (it made me, 0, so wild),
"RIMMEL'S a duck, but you're a goose!"
THE BBIOAITD'S BASKEK.—Ransom.
WILL HE CLEAR IT?
0, Hunting in Ireland's the height o" good sport:
Her horses the last to leap shy or short:
Her ditches the softest and sweetest for falls:
Her fences the break-neckest style of stone waLs:
Her riders the soornfullest of a spill:
Her foxes the 'cutest and hardest to kill:
Her hounds the choicest for nose and wind:
Her covers the surest a fox to find:
But unless you'd as soon come to grief as not,
And out of the saddle don't mind being shot,
And little reck risking brain or bone,—
You 'd better leave hunting in Ireland alone.
Ne'er was M.F.H. from the Sazon side,
Who safe through an Irish run could ride;
But let nerve and judgment be what they might,
And mount and seat be never so right,
Before the pack had come to a kiLl
He found it with him a case of spill.
Either he rode too hard at first,
And was pumped out just as it came to the burst:
Or his hand was too light, or too hard his hold;
Or he craned at his fences, or went too bold:
Or he fancied the ditches too easy to clear;
Or he thought the walls higher than they were;
But let him be slow, or let him be fast,
He found himself come to grief at last.
Than GLADSTONE, who hunts the St. Stephen's pack,
A pluckier rider ne'er crossed a back;
And as if at home he hadn't enough
Of yawning raspers and fences tough,
As the three last seasons have come round,
He has tried his luck over Irish ground;
And let the chaffers chaff their worst,
THUS far he has gone in flight the first;
Has had his run, and has seen his kill,
With scarce a shake, and never a spill,
And, riding pluckily up to the pack,
Has brought two Irish brushes back,
To flank his side-board on either hand,
One labelled " Church," and the other " Land."
And now, elated by what he's done,
He 's out again for an Irish run;
Bnt this time over harder ground,
For horse and rider, as well as hound.
He managed to clear without a pitch
That ugly yawner, Tenant-right Ditch;
And left the Slows of the field in the lurch,
At the rotten old fence round the Protestant Church;
But now comes a harder leap to clear.
And a much more serious cropper to fear,
For right in his way, thick, threat'ning, and tall,
Is the double-ditched Education-wall.
If that leap don't give GLADSTONE a shake,
He if a rider, and no mistake!
One for Himself.
THE other day the Claimant applied to the authorities of the
parish which is at present honoured by his residence, requesting
them to repair their roads. Had Mr. Punch been among the paro-
chial magnates, his answer would have been "That they would
repair their roads when the applicant should mend his ways."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MOMENTOUSIQUESTION.
ITH every post,
Correspondents in
all parts of the
world have inqaired
of Mr. Punch, both
by letter and tele-
gram, whether, as
the fourteenth of
February falls this
year on a Friday,
the proverbially
unlucky character
of that day will
have any disastrous
influence qn_those
tender Hussives—
varying in price
from one penny to
ten guineas—which
for ages past it had
been the practice in
this country to cir-
culate on St.;Valen-
tine's Day.
Mr, Punch, who
has been brought
up in the old faith
touching the sixth
day of the week,
and never puts on a
new pair of boots,
or makes a morning
call, or settles an
account, or eats
cold meat, or opens
an official letter, or
does anything else
which might expose him to risk on a Friday, has looked into the
Authorities (Surra's Classical Dictionary, The Statesman's Year
Book, his own Pocket-Book, &c.), and is n»w prepared to give
the following opinion on the important question which has been
submitted to him.
1. It is not unlucky to send a Valentine on Friday if it has been
previously inspected and approved by the parents or guardians of
the young person sending it, or if he or she happens to be a Ward
in Chancery, by the LORD CHANCELLOR. Bat—and these are the
points to be particularly attended to—the communication must be
dated in fall, subscribed with the name, address, and occupation
of the sender, and, if forwarded through the post-office, left open at
both ends.
2. It is not unlucky to receive a Valentine on Friday, provided it
is first opened and examined by the father or mother, or other
responsible relation, of the Minor to whom it is addressed, before it
is placed in his or her hands. If it is in manuscript, it must not
contain any original composition, but consist solely of one or more
extracts or quotations from any of the following works—Burke on
the Sublime and Beautiful, Chambers's Book of Days, Maunder's
Treasuries (including the adages which border the pages), and
Tapper's Proverbial Philosophy.
3. Subject to these restrictions, and the usual Postal Reflations,
Mr. Punch sees no reason why the circumstance of St. Valentine's
Day falling on a Friday should interfere with the attentions so long
accustomed to be (pre) paid to that Saint and Bishop on the
fourteenth of February.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MA.N
Finishes the Old Masters, lunches with his friend WAQG, and
addresses the Editor as usual.
No. 69. The Lock and the Mill. J. M. W. TUXNER, R.A.—Any
visitor expecting' to see the portraits [of two 'philosophers will be
disappointed. Those who expect only a Lock and a Mill will look
at the picture with such misty feelings as befit a Torneresque taste,
and will choose for themselves which is the Lock and which is the
Mill,—whichever you like, my little dears, and so pass on to
No. 71. Portrait of a Gentleman, Unknown, in a Black Dress,
Wearing a Ruff. Sot ANT. VANDTCK.—The ruff looks as though it
were wearing Aim, and the Gentleman Unknown seems to be bearing
it patiently. The portrait of this Homo Incognitus might be termed
"Aristocrat worried by a Huff." The labelling Committee have
settled him as a Gentleman, Unknown. It looks like a reward
offered for his discovery. Let this be a warning to all who have
their portraits taken to write their names legibly on the back and
in the 'corner. If the likeness is not flattering, that is, in your
opinion not truthf ul,_ write somebody else's name (an enemy's) on it.
or indorse your opinion of the Artist's incapability on the back of
the canvas, thus, "This teas intended by SMTLS, R.A. for me,
TOXKIKS. I paid him five hundred pounds for it, and it isn't in the
least like. I wish Posterity to understand that I teas a precious
tight belter looking than this. I remain Posterity's devoted admirer,
Toxfixs, St. Luke's, Chelsea, Vestryman."
I stop here to make a remark concerning the Policemen on duty.
They are, I suppose, specially selected for this sort of work. I know
immediately what my friend WAGG would say; he 'd point them out
as'' specimens of CONSTABLE," and chuckle over this for five minutes.
I did not notice one of this intelligent force wasting his time in
admiring a picture. To them the only study of Mankind is Man.
Thejr lounge about (they can't do otherwise), with a defiantly per-
missive air, which seems to say, " Yes, yon can walk in and see it;
0, yes, certainly; it amuses yon, and it doesn't hurt me. Walk in.
Only don't ask us anything about it, that's all."
They are, for all tneir insouciance, on the alert, and I felt sure
that any attempt on my part to walk off with, for example, The
Boar Hunt, by SxYKKKS (39 inches by 53 inches), would be detected
before I should be able to reach the front door. I think I could
manage to escape the notice of the Turnstile Men; or, if questioned,
I should say that I was the noble lender, the E MIL OF DENBIGH,
and had come to take it home. However, on my honour, and as
Your Representative, I shall not make the trial.
No. 80. Snyder's Boar Hunt.—Wh&t nice dogs to have about the
house. Snarleyows every one of them. Observe especially the
hound that has brought the boar to book at last. The poor animal, of
what WAGG calls the Tuscan race, is nailed by a wretched dirty white
dog with spots on it, which is neither of pure Dalmatian nor of
Danish breed, bnt is only to be described as a Currant Dumpling
Dog. Now, my Reader, who are taking This Representative as your
guide, just walk on rapidly to No. 124 in the Third Gallery. It is a
Portrait of a Young Man in dark Robes trimmed with Fur, painted
by JACOPO ROBTTSTI, alias TINTORETTO (J. ROBCSTI knew what a name
was worth well enough), and probably presented to the Young Man
as discount by his tailor. "Be that as it may," as WILLIAM THE
CONQUEROR used to say, what I wish you to observe is the fur.
This Young Man (whose name, perhaps, is NORVAL on the Grampian
Hills) has evidently killed that Currant Dumpling Dog, and trimmed
his robes with it. Between these two pictures, No. 80 and No. 124,
there is this mysterious link.
No. 80.
And
This is the Dog
That worries the Hog
As shown in the picture by SXTDERS.
No. 124. This is the Youth in robes fur-trimmed
Whom JACOPO TINTORETTO limned.
Who killed the Dog
That worried the Hog,
As shown in the picture by SNTDERS.
And now, if you please, placed in the corner for being such a bad
picture, remark
No. 12o. Portrait of Mariana of Austria, Second Wife of Philip
the Fourth, by Diego Velasquez.
I should imagine that PHILIP THE FOURTH had had a considerable
row with MARIANA, and had determined to have her portrait painted
by a great Master as a present insult and an immortal revenge. The
great Master had perhaps received private instructions on the sub-
ject. Quite a little tale of King, Queen, and Knave. As repre-
senting You, Sir, and as pretending to no more knowledge of
painting than of side-dishes—whereof I can confidently say when
they please me and when they do not, adding, diffidently, a hint as
to what might, probably, be done to render them exactly to my taste
—premising this, I ask what and where is the beauty of this picture?
"My dear Sir," somebody will reply, "it is a Velasquez." Quite
so, Somebody. Now, Somebody, come with me to
No. 149. Portrait of Dan Andrian Pulido Pareja, Knight of
Santiago, Admiral of the Fleet of New Spain, by the same DIEGO
VELASQUEZ.
Do yon recognise the same touch? Do you at all recognise the
same Master? If you do, tell me. Gentle Shepherd, and I will listen.
But do not tell me, for to this I will not listen, that No. 125 is a
good specimen of VELASQUEZ, or to be presented to the public as
anything but a specimen of what the artist could do when ne didn't
like the subject, or when acting under the orders of an Imperial
patron who happened also to be a spiteful and cynical husband.
Juan de Pareja (No. 141), and Andrtan Pulido Parefa (No. 149),
are'two Velasquez, for which the owners may thank Heaven, and
make no boast.
No. 130. VANBTCK'S Madame Kirk.—Very attractive to Presby-
terian Ministers. Scotch Episcopalians claim it as a portrait of
Mother Church. Doctors disagree.

CABOLINE KEPPEL, daughter of WILLIAM, Earl of Albemarle, by
SIR JOSHUA.
Ah! SIR JOSHUA, it must have been very nearly a miracle to have
succeeded in making that daughter stand still even for five minutes
in your studio! Why the sun at Ajalon was nothing to it.
Now, Sir, as Your Representative, I have no time to lose, so must
hurry on to
No. 190, Captain the Honourable Augustus Keppel, R.N.
Another Sir Joshua. There's the HONOURABLE AUGUSTUS, in full
uniform, standing on the sea-shore of some favourite watering-place,
and evidently saying to himself, on seeing the lowering clouds,
"There, I thought it was going to rain, and I 've come out with my
sword, instead of my umbrella I Just like me!" And I have no
doubt that the portrait was "just like him."
No. 201. Portrait in Armour of the Earl of Warwick, by VAN-
DYCK. The Earl looks as silly as might be expected in the circum-
stances. The Artist has exactly caught his expression at the
moment of his mentally soliloquising, " What an ass I 'm making of
myself!" This is painful. Let us on.
Nos. 224 and 226. Head of a Rabbi (SHBE) and Soy with a Rabbit
(RAEBURN).
No. 400. Portrait of Lady Rumbold and ker Children, by SER
JOSHUA, in tempera.
"Tempera mutantur," says WAGG, and insists upon my lunching
•with him at his Club. As representing You, Sir, I yielded. But
this, in return for his hospitality, was what I had to listen to.
Apropos of the Exhibition of Old Masters, I was saying, "Now,
who should you say, seriously, comes first?" WAGG replies, "I
don't know who comes first, but, by the Catalogue, I see Van der
Goes first." I smole. Presently, says he, " What artists' pictures
ought PICKFORD & Co. to buy?" I thought; but he answered him-
self, " Why, the Dutch artists, because they are nearly all Vans."
With the fish he recommenced: "Which of these Vans would be
the heaviest to remove?" I gave it up. "Van LEYDEN," says he.
I let the joke pass, and stopped the bottle. WAOG was full of it. I
have reason to think he was rehearsing on me the witticisms which
he was going to try that evening at a dinner-party. "It's odd,"
said WAGG, "that there should be only one single picture by DUB-
BELS. There are works by LIPPI under your very nosey. GLOVER
seems a handy fellow. I observe, from the Royal Academy's list,
that the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER is Chaplain. Didn't SANT, R.A.,
paint his portrait? Yes, I think I remember his picture by SAMUEL.
In bed, too. Pretty subject. The last name, continued WAGG,
at cheese time, "in the book is what all R.A.'s, and Associates, too,
all, in fact, who do the best pictures, must look forward to for im-
mortalisation. It is GRAVES. It 4s R- GTKAVBS who en-graves."
Fortunately, at this point I was called out, not by an antagonist,
but by a friend, and left WAGG meditating many more jokes in
the Academy Catalogue.
So ends my visit to the Old Masters.
The Representative Men—some of them the Mis-Representative
Men—have met at Westminster, and I hear of the Opera commencing
early (not before eight or half-past, though), where, and elsewhere,
I shall always be happy to appear as YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
Groat Expectations.
SOUEBODY living, it would seem, at Wimbledon, not, as might
have been expected, in Utopia, wants "Four Obliging Servants."
Probably the advertiser is just commencing housekeeping and
servant-keeping. On no other supposition does it seem possible to
account for the publication of such an extravagant demand. "Early
rising " is stated to be " indispensable." Let us hope that all four ser-
vants will oblige their master and mistress in this respect at least, and
vie with one another in emulating the larks on Wimbledon Common.

TRUE TACT.
Mrs. SUvertongue (who has been cliatting most agreeably to Mr. Wtlkes for the last
two hours). "0, DON'T TALK TO ME OP UGLY MEN, MB. WILKES I I MAKE A
POIXT OF JfSVSR JSVBtf SPEAKIJfO TO OHB I"
[Jfr. Wilkes, who is rather sick of being told by Women that they on the whole
object to good looks in the male sex, appreciates the remark immensely.
A CHEAP INDEMNITY.
Too much credit cannot be given to MB. GLADSTONE
for haying "volunteered to pay the reasonable costs
incurred by DB. HESSEL" in his defence, and " also to
S-uvidc the necessary funds for the passage to Brazil of
E. and MRS. HESSEL." This graceful act of restitution
was much better than waiting ignobly to pay an indem-
nity of serious amount demanded by Prussia. Suppose
an Englishman in China, by the mismanagement of the
Police, and the barbarous prison regulations of the
Chinese, had, whilst in custody under a groundless accu-
sation, been subjected to the hardships and indignities
inflicted on DB. HESSEL in England, what ample com-
pensation would have been exacted by ourselves I Per-
haps some alteration for the better will now be made in
the accommodation of persons detained during the in-
vestigation of charges which may prove unfounded. If
an innocent man has been only so much as imprisoned
through the necessity of proceedings requisite for the
public good, the Public owes him amends. It is for-
tunate that DB. HESSEL is satisfied, and does not, with
all Germany at his back, claim heavy damages for false
imprisonment.
New Tourists.
EVERY class of Society is making progress. It is
satisfactory to note that our domestic servants are not
insensible to the advantages of foreign travel, but have
begun to avail themselves of the opportunity their annual
holiday affords them of extending the area of their
acquaintance with that great world of which we are all
citizens. We have been led into these reflections by
seeing advertised, as in the press, a Tour with Cook
through Spain. We could have wished it had been
France, because of the useful hints she might have
gained from a personal experience of the cookery of that
country; but we will hope this is a lesson Cook will
learn in some future Vacation Ramble.
TEN YEABS HENCE.
MEMBERS now commonly wear their hats in the House.
They will not be allowed to do this when Ladies have
seats. It will be optional for Lady M.P.'s to keep their
bonnets on or not, as they please.
HINTS TO MAKE HOUSES WHOLESOME.
(By a Pupil of the late Dr. Swift.)
ALWAYS keep the windows shut; for thus you not only prevent
unwholesome draughts, but stop the smuts from flying in and dirty-
ing the furniture.
Never sweep under the beds, or the sofas, or the sideboards, but
allow the dust to remain there undisturbed, for otherwise its parti-
cles might float into the air, and injure respiration.
For the same reason, suffer the "flue" to settle on the tops of
wardrobes, pictures, bookcases, and cabinets, and refrain from in-
juring your ^health by attempting to remove it.
_ When visitors are expected, and you are honoured with instruc-
tions to clear out a bedroom closet, or perhaps a chest of drawers
for them, do so in as gentle a manner as you can, and spread clean
paper on the shelves without disturbing the dust which there has
peacefully accumulated.
Always put away your wine-glasses and decanters without wash-
ing them; and when a flower-vase is sent down from the drawing-
room, let the water remain in it to be ready for next time. You
thus may save yourself much trouble, and avoid the risk of
breakage.
When you are directed to light a bedroom lire for an unexpected
visitor, never look to ascertain if the register be closed. Should the
room be filled with smoke, recollect that fumigation is prescribed as
a means to stop infection.
_ Take it for granted that all the household linen has been well
aired at the wash, and do not disturb your mind by any doubts upon
the subject.
If damp sheets are the consequences, and illness should ensue
from them, you will have the consolation of reflecting that your
carelessness has been the means of bringing profit to an honourable
member of the medical profession, and that your master, and not
you, will have to pay the charges.
It is convenient to keep a dirty cloth or two underneath the sofa
cushions, in order to be handy to wipe up any mess which you un-
luckily may make, in case you should upset the milk-jug while you
are handing round the tea-tray.
If you are bidden to poke the fire (particularly in the library,
where you find your master intensely busy at his writing-desk), do
so with all the violence and vehemence that you can muster, in order
that the dust may fly into the room, instead of falling in the ash-
pan, whence you would have to undergo the labour of removing it.
When you go to light the gas, always turn it fully on before you
strike your match, which you will take care to keep damp and pro-
bably incombustible. A slight escape of gas not merely imparts a
piquant perfume to a room, but serves to turn the observation from
detecting even more offensive odours.
Never shake the rugs and doormats, or so much as even stir them,
if you possibly can help it. A goodly quantity of dirt may thus be
snugly stored beneath them, and need not be dislodged until the
yearly cleaning.
If your mistress be attached to pug-dogs, cats, or parrots, encou-
rage her to let them have their meals at the same table as herself,
and refrain from sweeping up the scraps which they may leave, lest
they afterwards may wish for them.
If canaries be her pets, do not clean their cages oftener than once
in every month or so, and fill up their baths and drinking fountains
without previously emptying them.
Above all things bear in mind that scrubbing is a painful and
degrading operation, and abstain therefore as much as possible from
practising it.
MEDIUMISTIC.
THE "Haunted Houses" of Tokenhouse Yard were sold the
other day. It is said that they were bought by the Spirits as a
pied a terre.

PENNY WISE.
National Schoolmaster (going round with Government Inspector). "WiLKlNS, now
DO YOD BRING SHILLINGS INTO PENCE?"
Pupil. "'PLEASE, Sin, 'TAKES IT ROUND TO THE PUBLIC-'OUSE, SIR! I"
LEGENDARY LORE.
THE Record is a paper in which jokes, of the voluntary
kind, are rare. But here is a story which may have made
some of its readers smile:—
• "The Ultra-Ritualist party are in great commotion about the
anticipated marriage of the son of a nobleman of high rank to the
daughter of one of the most eminent Jewish families naturalised
in England. Last Sunday the UKV M it. WEST strongly censured
the intended alliance from the pulpit, without naming die
parties, and it is rumoured that there is a combination among the
Ultra-Bitualists to prevent the licence from being granted."
If this comical tale is true, the Ultra-Ritualists therein
referred to must be very much ultra indeed; so much so,
as to have gone quite beyond all bounds. If a daughter
of Israel is about to marry an English nobleman's SOD, it
is to be presumed that she will embrace Christianity.
What objection can. Ritualists have to that'? Or else it
must be supposed that her husband will embrace Judaism.
The Pseudo Roman Catholic Ritualists mostly rejoice in
churches adorned as to their walls with illuminated texts
and legends. If any of them are capable of the folly and
impertinence for which the Record gives them discredit,
a text which used to be common in text-hand copy-books
should be conspicuously posted in the sacred edifioe they
are in the habit of frequenting. Among the scrolls that
teach them to live and die let there be inscribed in im-
pressive old English characters of divers colours the
salutary precept:—
jHniti $>our ©ton Business.
In case the REV. MB. WBST was really so superfluous
as to preach the sermon imputed to him, as above, by the
Record, the foregoing counsel cannot too forcibly be
commended to his attention, and to that of thoje who
are pleased to sit under him.
Ultra-Protestant Canard.
THE late severe weather has as usual been attended with
flights of wild ducks. A bird of that description will be
discerned in the following extract from a contemporary:—
"A NEW SAINT.—Advices received from Rome by the Vienna
New Free Press state it to be the POPE'S intention to canonise
MAHY QUEEN OF SCOTS."
"No, by St. Bride of Both well, no!" Canonise MABT
QUF.F.N OF SCOTS P Not the POPE, not His Holiness. Why.
if the Holy Father did that, the next thing he would
do would bo to canonise GUY FAWKKS.
THE STRIKERS STRUCK!
A TWELFTH-CAKE crust of snow we 've seen, o'erspreading, far and
wide,
The hills and dales, while Candlemas made up for Christmastide.
Fine weather for the country, but meanwhile a present bore
In some degree to each and all; a torment to the poor.
The heart that for another feels to agony is wrung,
If not by sense, by sympathy, with those by Winter stung.
But where are heard the voices which would once have cried " Poor
souls!
With blankets now present we them, provide them now with coals"?
Coals, that have reached a famine price, the richest need to save.
Blankets, in dearth of fuel, for home use all housewives crave.
Ah, why has Charity grown cold at this inclement hour?
Because disgust has turned the milk of human kindness sour.
The horny-handed sons of toil how painful to behold
Fain at their aching fingers' ends to blow the horn for cold.
No matter; striking on they go; strike higher still and higher,
"Excelsior!" crying with the Bard, and raising coals and firo.
Now that your horny hands, moat hard in grasping all they can,
For warmth lack blowing, Brothers, thank your Brother Working-
Man.
High price of Coal, which pinches all, yourselves withal must pinch.
But you, dear horny-handed friends, are not the men to flinch.
0 friends, whose hands are horny, and your hearts more horny still!
To see the Strikers struck themselves with grief all hearts must
thrill;
How sad that your own principle on your own heads should fall!
Sing, " Everybody for himself; the Dickens for us all!"
ILLITERATE LEGISLATION.
WE are bound to admit the necessity of modifying an appellation
which has been applied to the Licensing Act of last Session. It is
true that one of the first reforms which a supremely Reformed Par-
liament is required to effect as soon as possible is the reform of that
unpopular Statute. Difficulties in Courts of Justice are daily
created by what the Law Times calls "the eccentricities of this
marvellous document." "The LOBD CHFEF JUSTICE," says our
learned contemporary, "went so far as to say that it ought to be
enshrined. ME. JUSTICE BLACKBTJBN seems to be never tired of de-
nouncing it as a piece of blundering and puzzling legislation,
expressing his belief that a Member of Parliament would require to
be brighter than most of his acquaintances in order to succeed in
construing it." All this .is undeniable. On the other hand, the
Licensing Act, in so far as it is intelligible, is in a great measure
tyrannical and vexatious. Its Sabbatarian Clause constitutes a
monstrous nuisance to lodgers and excursionists, by debarring them
of refreshment at reasonable hours. By its compulsory go-to-bed-
betimes and early purl prohibiting clauses it also curtails the liberty
of grown men, and disciplines them like schoolboys. But it is not
therefore and altogether exactlywhat.it has been called— a Peda-
gogues' and Pedants' Act. At least it is not such a sort of Act as
the generality of Pedants and Pedagogues would frame. A Peda-
?ague is a teacher usually competent at least to teach boys English,
edants are, as a class, studious of precise language. As to that,
the Licensing Act is so disgraceful a composition as actually to have
been condemned by the Judges. It was evidently conceived, indeed,
in the Pedant's and^Pedagogue's spirit, but its wording as plainly
betrays the Dunce.
CANDLEMAS KEPT WHOLLY.
THE Ritualists have proved that they ought all to bo Roman
Catholics by rites.

PRETTY NEWS FOR PEACEMAKERS.
THANES to MB. BESSEMER and his suspended saloon,
we may hope ere very long to cross the sea in peace, and
more than that, indeed, we may hope, in case of war, to
be spared the cost of bloodshed. For see what the in-
ventor has said of his invention: —
"MR. BESSEMER stated that with his system there would be
no difficulty in securing a perfectly steady platform for the
heaviest pins, and in addition he could give automatic firing and
absolute certainty of aim."
A foe must be a bold one to confront the heaviest
guns, banging at him with an absolute certainty of aim.
One would fancy lighting would assuredly soon cease,
when absolute destruction awaited any combatant. The
best part, however, of MB. BESSEMEB'S invention is, that
it seems to lead to fighting by machinery, and without
the need of sacrificing human life in battle. For, if he
can give us guns that are made to fire themselves, he
may succeed in building ships that are devised to steer
themselves, and get up their own steam, and go in gal-
lantly to action, without the need of carrying a living
crew and captain. Guns firing automatically may lead
the way to nations fighting automatically; and war,
after a while, may be a game, like that of chess, played
in perfect safety by an army of automatons.
A Valentine from Venus.
"Ma. PUNCH never betrays secrets, but the following
Valentine passed into his hands in a very remarkable
manner, and he feels justified in enriching bis pages

tender:—
"February 14, 1873.
"VENUS sends her love to the Astronomer-Royal and
MB. LOCKYEB, and is delighted to hear that her. distin-
guished admirers in every part of the Earth are making
such grand preparations for her visit to the Sun next

never it-ill forget her first Love, JEBEMJAH HOBBOCKS,
the poor Curate of Hoole, her only attendant in 1639,
when for the first time mortals were pleased to take
notice of her transit. 'Fidelity, thy name is Woman,'
as SHAKSPEABE ought to have said. V."
ANTI-TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT.—The Lushai Expedition.
NO MOKE NOISES.
LET a piece of wood, or metal, be made into the form of a letter
U, about an inch in breadth withinside, half-an-inch or so in thick-
ness, and of a length sufficient to fit over the crown, close down the
sides of the head as far as to just below the ears. Through each of
iU ends, exactly opposite to the orifice of either ear, let there be
drilled a hole adapted to hold a screw, having a handle at the outer
end to work it to and fro with, at the inner a knob padded with
soft leather. The ends being made thick enough to contain the
screws, the connecting part might be reduced to any convenient
thinness. Worn over the head, this instrument will enable the
wearer, by simply turning the two screws, to stop his ears at plea-
sure, both of them, as effectually as he could with his thumbs or
fore-fingers; in the meanwhile his hands being left free for writing,
or any other use.
This contrivance will put it in a man's power at any time to rid
himself of the plague of odious noises by producing temporary deaf-
ness at will. Against all manner of din and discord, and things he
had rather not hear, he will therein have at command an effectual
remedy. To stop off any sort of sounds which offend his ears, he
will only need to screw on his ear-stopper. For instance:—
When an organ-grinder comes and plays under his window, and
>ie does not choose to take the trouble of going out to make the
wretch be off.
When a maid-servant outside of his sitting-room is scrubbing the
passage floor, or wall.
Whilst he is reading or writing, when there are girls in the next
room, together with young men who have called to flirt with them,
and he is ^interrupted by irritating, inarticulate sounds of small-
talk, tittering, squeaks, and suppressed laughter.
If he is the inmate of any abode containing a baby that cries and
is not kept at the far end, or the top of the house, or down in the
VOL. LXIV.:
cellar. In case he is the father of a family, whensoever he retires
to his library or study, if his nursery is anywhere near it. Especially
when any child is teething.
By night and day, if there is a howling dog on the adjoining
premises.
Above and beyond all things, whenever anyone has a cough in the
house.
Whensoever circumstances over which one has no control have
compelled him to go to an evening-party, where he finds himself a
wall-flower, and is bored and fidgeted by the dance-music. The
ear-stopper rendering that inaudible, the spectacle of the people
dancing about may even afford him some diversion.
Dining or smoking at a Club or Restaurant, when the people
about him are talking horse or something worse, or mere nonsense
that is too tedious.
In the House of Commons, as the rule, when any Member gets on
his legs, and attention is not a matter of business.
At Church, as often as the sermon is uninstruotive; which some-
times happens. To preclude scandal and offence on occasions of this
kind the handles of the instrument could be formed so as to resemble
the mouths of little trumpets, and thus make the ear-stopper pass
for a voice-conductor.
A person of a sensibility apt to be shocked by words expressive of
revolting ideas, would completely protect himself from outrage of
that kind by being provided with an ear-stopper, to wear under his
hat, and screw on immediately whenever he has to approach the
regions of the humbler classes. The ear-stopper will prove itself a
true friend in need to the refined Philanthropist traversing the
slums on an errand of love and mercy.
Let Quacks take out patents for inventions and advertise them
under crackjaw names. Any surgical instrument-maker is at
liberty to make the Ear-stopper, and, if he likes, he may call it the
Otocatacleion, or the Anacoustio.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

HIS Ifonday, Feb.
10, LORD KIMBEB-
LKT, Colonial Sec-
retary, informed
LOUD BELMOKE
that our naval
officers in the Aus-
tralian seas have
instructions to be
very energetic in
hunting down the
scoundrels who
kidnap the South
Sea Islanders.
There is one fellow
calling himself
CAPTAIN HAYES,
who ia a great
stealer of men and
women, and who
threatened to flog
the King of one of
the Islands, and
did actually carry
away a Princess.
If this pirate can be caught, and affixed to one end of a loaded cannon, a light
might be applied at the other end, with the very happiest results.
The Postmaster-General, MB. MONSELL (who had enough to do this Valentine
Week) will not at present reduce the price of a telegram to Sixpence. His rea-
son is that the department is not strong enough to undertake more work. Make
it strong enough, is the obvious reply; but, of course, officialism would shake its
head at that, and say that circumstances demanded deliberate consideration.
Then we had the Park Rules, and a single combat between ME. VEBNON
HABCOTJRT and MB. AYRTON. It was amusing enough, but the affair has now
gone by. Enough to say that ME. AYBTON really defended himself very well,
managed to involve the whole Ministry in the business, and concluded by re-
marking that MB. HABCOUHT thought himself to be " the only wise man in the
House, and that all the rest of the Assembly were fools." All the same, there
was this to be said about the Rules—the Ministers have tried four sets of them.
The newest lot have been stuck up, and mob meetings may be held only in the
space nearest Park Lane. This gives the patriots about a third of the Park.
The rest of the eveningwould have been dull enough, but that on a question
about the business of the House, theltwo MESSES. BENTINCK tired off some volleys
of discursive abuse, and ME. LOWE gave a sarcastic answer, intimating that he
should take the liberty of disregarding speeches that had nothing to do with
the question at issue. On division, Government got things their own way by
148 to 78. The point is, that certain Members do not like to sacrifice any chance
of making speeches, while the Ministers want to get on with real work. If gentle-
men who want to speechify would go and do it in the tea-room, while those who
do not want to do so mind the business of the House, matters would be made
easy and agreeable.
Tuesday.—We are signing maps, to show our obedience to the decision of the
German Emperor touching St. Juan. It might be uncivil to recollect a story
that was told, at the time we settled the Oregon question, about a map which
an exceedingly ingenious American person prepared, and which an exceedingly
unsuspicious English person accepted—a charming and admirable map, but with
a trifling variation from vulgar and prosaic exactitude—the result being that
England came off second-best in a conflict of two. However, there is no danger
of anything of that kind now—for we give up everything.
Nothing worth notice in the Commons, except that SIB DOMINICK CORRIGAN
introduced a Bill for preventing anybody in Ireland from buying anything to
drink on Sundays. The "dwellers by the melancholy ocean" will have a
pleasant time of it. if the Bill passes. However, SIB D. C. is an eminent
medical man, so he knows what is good for PADDY.
Wednesday was given to the Ladies. SIB THOMAS CHAMBERS, who should
be called my Lady's CITAMBEBS, and who has been going upstairs and downstairs
with the Deceased Wife's Sister's Bill so long, brought it up again. It has
been_ before the House for twenty-four years, and out
of sixty-six divisions on it, sixty-three have been
in its favour. The Lords have rejected it six times.
Bat then the Commons have done so four times.
MB. BEBESFOBD HOPE opposed the Bill, and there
were several other speakers, but, Madam, you are
much too clever to wish to hear what has been said
so many times—though perhaps incessant repetition of
the same thing is not inappropriate to a discussion on
a feminine question. That, Madam, is only our goak,
and as you justly say, if an argument is good one day, it
must be good another. Well, Madam, we will only
note rather a neat observation by MB. O'REILLY DBASE,
whom we half suspect of being an Irishman. He said
that he belonged to a Church which forbids the marriage
which it is sought to legalise, and but for that he should
think the legalisation a very good thing. MB. O'DgASE,
however, forgot that his Church very often grants dis-
pensations for such marriage!), when good reason for
them can be shown. The Second Reading was carried
by 126 to 87. But we do not think the time very near
when a gentleman pointing to his late wife's photograph,
will be entitled to say to his sister-in-law, in the words
of the very good-natured lady in Tom Thumb :—
"I 're married ' her,' and now I '11 marry you."
Thursday.—This was the great night of the week.
The LOBD CHANCELLOR and the PREIUEB had each an
important Bill to submit.
LORD SELBORNE proposes to establish a Supreme
Court of Judicature. Now, all wise people keep out of
Courts of Law of all kinds, and there is no very violent
•si felt in general Society about the composition of
our tribunals. We have perfect confidence in the justice
of our Judges, but as to who sits in what and what's
done to whom, most people's ideas are vague. Ladies
(except those who wnte sensation novels) may possibly
be aware that criminals are not tried for their lives in
the Court of Chancery, that MR. LOWE ia not the chief
of the Court of Exchequer, and that a Vice-Chancellor
is not so called because he has to dispose of matters con-
nected with divorce. It is very gratifying when one
meets with people whose minds have been cultured up
to these points. Bnt on the general constitution of our
Courts of Law and Equity most folks know, and are
content to know about as much as they knew of the East
End of London, before SIB UICHABD WALLACE (about to
be M.P.) invented Bethnal Green.
Will any good cause be served by Mr. Punch's giving
an elaborate analysis of the subject ?" Can't you let it
alone_? " was the great and good LOBD MELBOURNE'S first
question, when any bothering business was proposed to
him. Will anybody be the happier for knowing exactly
what LORD SELBORNE proposes to do? We trow not.
Argal, we shall simply state that he gathers all the
higher courts (of course, not County Courts, or Tennis
Courts, or anything of that sort) together, and divides
the business into Four Groups, to be presided over by
Twenty-one Judges. He creates a new Court of Final
Appeal, instead of the Judicial Committee. Law Terms
—we don't mean its jargon—to be abolished. In the
Supreme Court the Lord Chief Justice of England is to
be the
"Supreme, high-throned all height above,
The great Felasgic, Dodonomn Jove,"
and the Lord Chancellor is to be the head of the Appeal
Court And when the Temple of Justice shall be up-
reared in the Strand (it has so far advanced to comple-
tion that clerks are calculating quantities, with a view to
considering what sort of contracts should be made before
the work is begun), all the business will go on simulta-
neously under one noble roof. Some wigs will have
worn off the hair now flourishing on some gay young
advocates' heads before that day, but the world has

LORD CAIRNS generally approved the scheme, and paid
a graceful compliment to the eminent man who had
brought it forward.
In the Commons MR. GLADSTONE delivered a great
speech, elaborate, but with touches of lightness. His
work was to expound the Government Bill for Improving
the Higher Education of Ireland; that is, the University
System.
Now, in that marvel of wit, BEATJMAKCHAIS' Marriage
of Figaro, Count Almaviva, who is jealous, hears his
servant describe a terrible danger he has been in, and

calmly remarks, "You might understand that it is not your danger
that concerns me in the least, hut the cause of it." Mr. Punch,
without being uncharitable, ventures to believe that a good many
worthy people are not so much concerned to know the means by
which rude young Irishmen are to he converted into elegant Under-
graduates, as the way in which MB. GLADSTONE hopes to manage to
satisfy at once the Ultramontanists and those who hate them. That
laudable curiosity shall he satiated.
So far from destroying the University of Dublin, it is to be made
the central sun of the educational system; but then a good many
things are to be done to it, and there is to be a new Governing Body.
The homage thus paid to the University will, it is hoped, please the
Protestants.
But inasmuch as the object is to induce Catholics to avail them-
selves of College advantages, and as the Priests will not permit
young Papists to learn several things which Protestants are not
afraid to teach to youth, there is to be no instruction in Theology,
Moral Philosophy, or—listen, 'tis no jest!—Modern History!
Dearest Madam, do not let us he extravagant, and expend in one
huge laugh the amusement which ought to last us during all the
debates on this Bill. But do you not already hear the voices of
those who sit in the seat of the scorner? Do you not hear echoes
of the voice of the late MH. HENBY DBUMMOND? Pass for theology,
pass for philosophy, but Modem History. That must not he
taught, lest the faith of the young Roman be endangered. 0, we
shall have some rare fun, Madam.
Nevertheless, ME. GLADSTONE'S savagest political enemies—and
he has some whose rancour is very offensive to candid people—allow
that he has performed a miracle of cleverness, and that his Bill is
not nearly so dreadful as they expected. The details of his dealings
with the existing Colleges will best be understood when the debates
come on. There is an application of some of the funds of the Dis-
established Church which ought not to displease its friends.
We have said that there were light touches in the long speech.
Here is one.
"There is a love of letters in Ireland. Ireland is not barbarous in mind,
and bin; may say of herself—
'Nee sum ade& informis; nuper me in litore vidi,
(.' 11 'ti placidum ventis etaret mare'
(cheers). If you will only give Ireland a tranquil sea in which to mirror
herself (the close of the sentence was lost in loud Conservative cheers.)"
MR. DISRAELI reserved all remark, but asked for a long time to
consider the Bill. The Second Heading was fixed for next Monday
week.
Friday.—In the Commons ME. AYTOUN'S nnhappiness about our
relations with the POPE found vent in a motion for papers, but not
comfort in a speech from LOBD ENPIELD, who said he had explained
the matter twice last year. "I've related it once," says SAM
WELLES. "Werry well, Sir," says his father, " Relate it again."
LOBD ENFIBLD having given his third explanation, the motion was
rejected by 116 to 63.
MB. RTLANDS has many merits, and if we castigate him now and
then, it is all for his good, as we are sure he feels. He considers
that the House ought to discuss all Treaties before they are ratified.
LOBD E. FITZMAUBICE made a very able historical speech in oppo-
sition: the LANSIJOWNES have always been in the habit of culti-
vating their minds. ME. GLADSTONE declined to go into a course of
constitutional speculation. Then the House, unlike JESHTUBON,
neither waxed fat nor kicked its heels, but waxed so thin that the
debate died in the presence of seven Members.
That case of SUB-LIEUTENANT TBIBE was waked'up again by
LOBD ELCHO, whom MB. CABDWELL charged with having eaves-
droppers at the War Office, perhaps under the table. The gentle
Druid was riled. He did not want to hear any more about "that
unfortunate young man," who was now quite out of the Army.
MB. NEWDEGATE once more introduced a Bill for a Commission to
examine Monasteries and Convents. The usual opposition was
offered, but one gentleman said he had four sisters in a Convent, and
should be happy to introduce them all to MB. NEWDEGATE. The
latter is a man of much gallantry, and we were rather surprised that
he did not instantly exclaim " Delighted, I'm sure." But we have
no doubt that he has already gone down and made a favourable im-
pression on the ladies. The Bill was allowed to come in by 74 to 31.
Just before this—we save the bonne louche for the end—it was
stated, in defence of Railway Companies, that they do not really
over-crowd cattle in the pens, but that, when cattle have stopped,
for the purpose of feeding, they "wisibly swell," and get so large
that they can scarcely be got back into the conveyance ;—" so there
is an appearance of over-crowding." Mr. Punch rushed home and
read Baron Munchausen, till he fell asleep, and then he dreamed
that he was the Claimant.
Aw EitrTr CEREMONY.—A string of private carriages, with nobody
inside them, following a funeral.

RANGERS' RIGHTS.
EBY much attention having of
late years been drawn to our
Parks, a carefully - prepared
statement of the privileges and
perquisites of their Rangers—
not to be found on any Notice
Board—will be felt to be a
seasonable contribution to con-
temporary history.
A Ranger is entitled to the
young of all animals, living in
a wild state, born within the
boundaries of his Park between
sunrise and sunset, and again
from sunset to sunrise. (X.I'..
Birds'-nests are specially pro-
tected, both by Statute and
Common Law, from .disturb-
ance.)
A Ranger can claim every
tenth egg deposited by poultry
in his Park, or by the orna-
mental fowl inhabiting any
lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, or
other navigable waters within
the limits of his jurisdiction.
But it has been decided by the
Judges sitting »'» banco (see the
case of Rex v. PiUikins) that a
Ranger has no lien on the eggs
laid by fowls kept by a Lodge
keeper for domestic purposes, provided they were laid during the
hours when the keeper was not required to be in his official uniform.
A Ranger has the exclusive right of angling in any waters within
his demesne on fourteen days in every year, but he must not take
more than fourteen pounds weight of fish at a time. He may catch
any kinds of fish he pleases, except pike, perch, barbel, bream,
flounders, carp, tench, grayling, trout, and salmon traut.
All treasure-trove found in the Park is the absolute property of
the Ranger, but there has been no instance now for more than a
century of any Ranger claiming odd halfpence.
A nosegay of flowers, gathered in the Park, is presented to the
Ranger annually, on his birthday. If the anniversary happens to
fall in the winter months, then a bunch of evergreens may be sub-
stituted.
He has rights of turbary, and can cut as much turf for his private
use as his head gardener can carry on his back, between Candlemas
Day and Latter Lammas.
Every Ranger may invite'his private friends to a pic-nio in any
spot he may select; and he is allowed to employ as many of the
Park-keepers as can be spared from their official duties without
detriment to the public service, as occasional waiters.
He is presented, on his installation, with a private key, which
enables mm to have access to the Park at all hours of the day and
night; but, in the event of his losing or mislaying it, he cannot be
allowed a new key until the old one has been found.
The Ranger of a Park is the only person who enjoys the privilege
of riding in it on a Velocipede.
Once in every year the Ranger, in full uniform, and attended by
a crowd, makes the circuit of his Park on horseback, inspects the
Keepers, Constables, Boatmen, Sentries, and other officials, who fire
a feu de joie at the close of the ceremony; and visits the lodges,
boat-houses, wells, fountains, public statues and monuments, which
are lit up with fireworks in the evening.
The uniform of a Ranger is a green jerkin, with primrose facings,
hat and a feather, baldrick. and long Spanish leather hoots, and he
carries a horn slung across his shoulders with cord and tassels.
Oceans of Grog.
GENTLEMEN of the United Kingdom Alliance, what do you say to
the following announcement in the Times t Of course your Chief,
SIE WILFEID LAWSON, will tell the Government what he thinks of
it:—
"The Admiralty contract for 3-5,000 gallons of rum was on Saturday taken
by ALFRED LAMB AND SPEMCBB."
There is exciting news for you, Gentlemen of the Liquor Law
Platform. Is not the excitement it is calculated to create in your
minds such that, perhaps, in the presence of My Lords' Board, if a
festive board, the thought of it alone would he enough to make most
of you throw bottles? Intemperate acts may be expected of those
who advocate total abstinence itself in intemperate language.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
HAD the honour, Sir, of re-
presenting You—I should
say, You had the honour
of being represented by
me—at the French Plays,
New Royalty Theatre,
where the delighted Mana-
ger and the enthusiasti-
cally civil Box-keepers
placed me, like Jack
Homer, in a corner, be-
tween the Big Drum and
an affable Italian gentle-
man. Opposite to me were
a couple of intelligent
Horn-blowers, of foreign
extraction, whose occa-
sional performances were
of a startling character.
I do not object to being
seated near violins: they
generally have more than
their share of the per-
formance, and their notes
scuttle about like mice in
a wainscot. Yon get ac-
customed to violinists in
a very few seconds; and
as for flautists, one really
does not care whether they play or not—of so slight a value,
ordinarily speaking, is the sound of this wheezy orchestral lung.
A piccolo makes one great flourishing to-do, and finishes. He
startles you once, and has done with it. A clarinet-player
would be an unobtrusive neighbour, were not your attention
constantly being drawn to him on account of the pity which
his attitude naturally excites in any sentimental breast. No
matter who he be, a clarinet-player, in full blow, cannot help
looking like a placid fool with a large sugar-stick. If 'tis
my fate to be near any of the gentlemen of the band, place me by
the violinist, who is generally of a highly artistic turn of mind; by
the clarinet-player, who looks as though he lived by some melan-
choly ocean; or by the flautists, whose nimble fingers stop as many
holes as they can all at once, but are unable to prevent the tune
escaping by one or two of the unstopped ones—evidently a defect in
the instrument. But do not put me by the Big Drum. Cheerful
the performer on that instrument mint be, and full of animal spirits:
deaf, of course. Isn't it a recognised fact that all cheerful people
are deaf? No: I am wrong: I thought I was: it is, that " All deaf
people are cheerful." And, now I come to think of it, it's "blind
people," not deaf. But this, as Your Representative, I pronounce
to be a mere detail.
If your object, on going to a theatre, be to hear the Big Dram,
sit'by the Big Drummer; if to hear anything else, don't.
I had heard so much in favour of tne company at the Royalty,
that I was prepared for something far above the average of any
English acting. You shall presently see whether my expectation
was disappointed. The piece played was " the famous Palais Royal
Comldie en Trots Actes, entitled Le RSveillon,"
Judged by a Palais Royal standard, the ReveUlon, which has
about as much right to be dignified by the title of "Comedy" as
Box and Cox to be called a tragedy, is, undoubtedly, in Dean
Street, Soho, successful. That at least half the "business" of
MESSES. GEOFFROY, HYACINTHE, and LASSOTTCHE, the originals, is
omitted by their representatives at the Royalty, is probable, and to
this may oe partly owing the feeling of disappointment which, as
far as Your Representative was concerned, certainly increased as
the play progressed. What there can be to admire in the Palais
Royal style of perpetually appealing to the public, and actually
walking down to the footlights to deliver " asides " to the audience,
has been, and always will be, a puzzle to Your Representative. In

an Anglicised and expurgated edition of RfreiUon, I think I could
easily find two low comedians on the English stage who would be
far better representatives of the characters Gaillardin and Touritton
than even MM. GEOFFKOY and LHEBITIEB of the Palais Royal,
without instituting any comparison nearer home. It is enough for
some English playgoers that a company should be French, for them
at once to go into ecstasies over their performance, whatever it may be.
Let the company be acknowledged as only second-rate, as a scratch
affair, as no better than what might be seen doing The Lady of
Lyons in an English provincial town, no matter—it is French; and
with these patrons of the Drama, who, perhaps, have never done
more than talk about going to Paris, and have never gone farther
than Boulogne, having been stopped by the difficulties of the lan-
guage, to know that it is French is sufficient. Tell them that the
actors are Belgians, and they wouldn't stir from their firesides—not
even were a private box placed at their disposal, the red baize laid
down, and the Manager, with wax-lights, at the doorway to receive
them. Go to the Royalty, hoping to see fair French farce-acting in
Le ReveUlon, and you will see it. M. SCHEY is amusing: his wig a
wonder. By M. DIDIER, as Gaillardin, exuberant laughter was not
excited. What he had to say was certainly droll enough, but that
was of course due to those generally forgotten persons, the Authors,
MEILHAC and HALEVT. Droll most of the dialogue certainly is—
witty occasionally; but—I do not fancy that among the frequenters
of the Palais Royal are many French'ladies, and hence it is that in
the Revetilon there are some remarkably telling strokes made with a
very broadly-pointed cue. However, with the LORD CHAMBERLAIN
to the fore, far be it from Your Representative
To play the Censor morum,
Ana preach about deoornm.
There aw just two things that must be said of Le ReveUlon at
the Royalty: it is fairly acted all round, and the stage management
of the Supper Scene is only at this present moment outdone in its
excellence (the opportunity being a larger one, and capable of further
development) by that scene in Money at the Prince of Walcs's
Theatre.
Now, Sir, those who do me the honour of reading this "Repre-
sentation," will probably observe that my view of the performance
must have been seriously interfered with by the Big Drum. No:
certainly not. He disturbed my rest in the entr'acte, which was
dreadfully long each time, but he had nothing whatever to do with
the piece. By the way, MLLE. WILHEM must be honourably men-
tioned as the blase Prince Yermantoff. She had very little to do,
and it was very well done. The best performance, to my thinking,
was that of M. Duparquet, by M. HESTEVAUX, who never once lost
sight of the importance of his subordinate part. Duparquet is a
superior sort of CHARLES his friend,"and his practical joke is the
motive, such as it is, of the play.

point which characterises me as
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
GAMBLERS AND THIEVES.
HEAR the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE of the Court of Queen's Bench :—
"I cannot but express my regret that, with the mass of business in this
court, two days of valuable time should have been taken up in the re-estab-
lishment, if possible, of the character of an habitual gambler—a gentleman
who goes about the country with dice in his bag, ready to play with anyone
who will engage to play with him."
It may be thought that if there can be "honour among thieves,"
so likewise honour may possibly exist among gamblers. But,
close as the resemblance between theft and gambling may be,
gamblers, in one respect, differ widely from thieves. A thief is a
thief in relation to the community; as thief to thief he is an honest
man, or at least he may be, so that honesty among thieves might as
well be proverbial as honour. Whereas, gamblers prey altogether
upon each other. It is possible to play fair at vingt-et-un, chicken-
hazard, or blind-hookey, but in the mind that gives itself up to
games of hazard can the craving for gain be supposed to be regulated
by any higher consideration than the fear of being detected in
cheating? Those only who imagine that an habitual gambler may
possibly have a taste for morality, can regard any question about the
honour of such a person as otherwise than ridiculous.
A Hint for Teetotallers.
THE cause of total abstinence would seem not to be favoured by
the Church of England to the extent its advocates must desire. We
see advertised, by a high dignitary of the Establishment, "Christian
Cordials."

OUB SCIENTIFIC SELVES.
A COURSE of Cantor Lectures is attracting certain notice, including
our own, which in itself is a distinction. The subject of the series is
announced by a contemporary to be " The Energies of the Impon-
derables." To our mind this is just exactly the sort of subject we
should choose, if we were asked to give a lecture to a College of
Young Ladies, or an Infant Ragged School, or wherever else we
fancied we could look as wise and talk as scientifically as we pleased,
without running any risk of our wisdom being doubted. In lectur-
ing, as in conveyancing, it is doubtless of importance to make out a
good title; and certainly in this case the author seems to have suc-
ceeded. Were we to try to lecture anybody on the Energies of the
Imponderables, we should probably say something to disturb the
Gravity of the Impressionables. and, if some of our own children
chanced to be among the audience, we should outrageously be
assailed by the Levity of the Incorrigibles.

KINO AxADEtrs has vacated the throne of Spain; and no wonder
that we are also told by telegram from Madrid that—

However, a band amounting to no more than forty-two men could
scarcely dp more to help the Carlist cause than playing Legitimist
Spanish airs.

IT is not true, that in the LORD CHANCELLOR'S scheme for the con-

SUNDAY EVENINGS' ENTERTAINMENTS.
_ AN uncommonly lively discourse was, according to the Post, de-
livered on the evening of Sunday last week, under the auspices of
the National Temperance League, at the Alhambra Temperance
Music-hall in Shoreditch, by a MB. W. NOBLE. This gentleman
has had the diligence to commit to memory the whole of the lectures
heretofore delivered by Ma. J. B. GOUGH, "the celebrated temper-
ance lecturer of America." The National Temperance League were
desirous of bringing Ma. GOUGH across the Atlantic to redeliver
them; but that Demosthenes of teetotalism was not to be tempted
over the Big Drink. They have therefore hired ME. NOBLE to
deliver all Mi;. GOUGE'S lectures at second-hand; and, on the above
named occasion, as we are told, "he engaged the attention of a
large audience for upwards of an hour by his recital of ME. GOUGE'S
oration 'On the Importance of the Temperance Movement.'" This,
the first of MB. NOBLE'S series of imitations, appears to have been a
great success, and it no doubt constituted exactly the sort of enter-
tainment which our provincial contemporaries are wont to style " a
high intellectual treat." Given, to begin with, on a Sunday even-
ing, it is likewise, evidently, to be regarded as the thin end of the
wedge in respect of Sunday evenings' amusements. The thick end
will perhaps comprise other performances, of a character still more
edifying. Next to the orations of MB. J. B. COUGH we shall perhaps
have the sermons of our most distinguished preachers delivered, in
character, by some serious mimic; specimens, for instance, of DEAN
STANLEY, or DB. NEWMAN HALL, or MB. SPUBGEON. Then, probably,
political and parliamentary orations will be subjected to the same
treatment, and the British Public will be enabled to enjoy a Sunday
"Night with GLADSTONE," or a counterfeit presentment of the
eloquence of MB. DISKAELI, or any other of the leading masters of
debate, Conservative or Liberal. The descent to comic recitations,
and so down, will be easy.
Doubtless MB. NOBLE proved himself a clever imitator of excellent
original fustian in diverting a large audience by a declamation a la
Gough "On the Importance of the Temperance Movement." Of
course he directed attention to a point, relative to that most inte-
resting subject, not perhaps generally considered, but one of some
importance as a matter of illustration. Surely MB. NOBLE could
not fail to make his beloved hearers perceive, by appropriate action,
that, whereas the Temperance Movement always tends right ahead,
the course taken by the Intemperance Movement is generally
zigzag.
REFORM IT ALTOGETHER.
SYMPATHISING with DB. HESSEL, and congratulating hi™ upon
the substantial proof given him of what English opinion is in regard
to his case, it does occur to us to ask if an innocent subject has not
been taken up before this, and, if so, why has not the subject been
taken up with the same enthusiastic indignation as has been so re-
cently evoked by the arrest and imprisonment of DB. GOTTFEIED
HESSEL P HEB MAJESTY has sent to apologise for the state of her
own Law. Quite right: only it is fortunate for the chances of im-
Erovement in our 'police 'administration that the innocent sufferer
appened to be DB. HESSEL, a German, and not Jrsi SMITH, an
ordinary Englishman. Perhaps poor SMITH, in his devout admira-
tion of the British Constitution, would have taken the opportunity
of his'' leaving the Court without a stain on his character'' to extol the
wisdom and justice of the Law which had rightly arrested him on
suspicion, and as rightly set him free on discovering that there was
no sort of ground for the charge. The French Law treats an arrested
person as guilty until he proves his innocence, and acts in accord-
ance with this theory. In England, we make a boast of considering
every man innocent until proved guilty. But we know our theory
to be a mere idle formula as long as the practice is to treat every
man guilty until he be proved innocent.
If DB. HESSEL'S case leads to a thorough reform in this particular
direction, then the grateful English public will probably erect a
statue of him on the vacant pedestal in Leicester or Trafalgar
Square, or send it him, carriage paid, to be put up where he likes in
his own native place.

VENUS AND THE LADY.
ONE day last week the Times published a long and elaborate
article, luminous as Venus herself, upon the transits of that planet.
In a French paper the same space would be devoted to a nauseating
love-story. It may be questionable, however, whether the love-
story is not better suited to some people. Having mastered the
article, Mr. Punch handed it to a lady-friend who improves and
invigorates her mind by the perusal of about n've novels every week.
He requested her to read the three columns. This she did with
excessive rapidity, and on being asked to state what she thought about
it, she sweetly replied that it was most interesting. Particulars being
demanded, she affirmed that MB. LOWE was going out to see the
transit of Venus in 1874; that Venua is worth tenpence in the
pound; that she is an Inferior Conjunction ; that she will look like a
small ball in a large wine-glass, and have a ring as big as the world;
that she is inhabited by " eagle-eyed daws"; that she is the size of
a shilling seen eight miles off by a man with thick hair on his head
at the end of a church; and that gold medals are fit only for puffing
shopkeepers. Finally, she said it was all " an astronomical mare's
nest"; adding, as her own unaided discovery, that men were always
fussing and flinging away money on stuff and nonsense.
The Satisfactory Settlement.
So the real losses sustained by American Citizens from the Con-
federate cruisers amount to little more than two millions, whereas
the damages we have to pay for them were assessed at three millions
and a quarter. Which will have been cheated, the private American
claimants, or ourselves? This question is more interesting than
material. By those who are capable of cheating their own people
how much faith is likely to be kept with any other? In case
Alabamas ever leave American ports to prey on British shipping,
what compensation will the Britishers obtain? If ever we go to
war, we shall see.

BOB LOGIC.
ABOUINO that there was no possible substitute for the Income-
tax, in answer to a deputation from the Associated Chambers of
Commerce that waited on him the other day to urge its immediate
repeal, MR. LOWE is reported to have said that :—
"He could suggest means of raising the revenue by putting taxes up«n
articles that had already been reduced or freed, as sugar, tea, coffee, or the
duties on life assurance; but these things had been considered more oppressive
and injurious than the Income-tax itself, and such a course would be a
retrospective step."
Vettigia nulla retrortum. That is MR. LOWE'S argument against
reverting to just indirect from unjust direct taxation. By the way.
"retrospective " must be a reporter's substitution for "retrograde."
Vestigia nulla retrortum is perhaps hardly so logical a reason for
not taxing sugar, tea, and coffee rather than income, as Ex luce
lucellum was for taxing lucifer-matches. One would imagine, con-
sidering the utter impossibility which Chancellors of the Exchequer
seem to see in replacing a partial tax on incomes by duties on the
groceries above named, that the victims of the Income-tax consist,
aa a class, of persons who do not consume as much tea, coffee, and
sugar' as other people, and particularly as the Striking Classes,
whose incomes escape taxation, and who have raised the price of
butcher's meat and all other provisions, by daily eating meat at
dinner, and likewise at every other meal, and making, generally,
three or four meals a day.
See Advertisement.
OCR Navy seem to have some curious wants. The Contract De-
partment of the Admiralty invite tenders for Blue Jean, Comforters,
Duck, Duck Coaling, Flashing, South Westers, and Stay Tape—the
last article of commerce being required, we presume (the public
notice is not explicit on this point) lor lacing the ships' stays.
TWO ASH-WEDNESDAY OBSERVATIONS.
EVERT dog has his day. As All Saints have a festival to them-
selves so All Sinners expect their turn, and take it on Ash-Wednes-
day, still known as Dies Cinerum, which is, being uneoclesiastically
and freely translated, All Sinners' Day. It used to be spent as a
Fast day: now, however, the day is kept. The night has by use
pretty well established itself as a Fast one, in some instances, a very
Fast one. Yet a variety of tastes is consulted. Dust and ashes may
be still emblematical even of amusement; as, for instance, at an
Islington Music-hall, where there is a sort of Ballet-Ball, which will
result in kicking up a goodish dust, while the dust will be "come
down with pretty handsomely in many instances. And there 'a an
Oratorio at the Albert Hall which symbolises ashes, at least, the
next thing to it, i.e., COLE. The two ideas of devotion are thus re-
presented at Islington and Kensington, and we hope that both
Devotees and Dancers will be none the worse for their Wednesday
night on Thursday morning.
Boots and Being.
AHONO the various advertisements round about that beautify
every practicable surface, the wayfarer may have noticed one which
offers him boots so constructed as to be capable of being continually
renovated by haying affixed to them, when necessary, a new heel.
This is an ingenious contrivance for prolonging a boot's existence,
but, alas! it will make no boot last for ever. Besides that, the
upper leathers must still wear out, and the renewal of the heel of a
boot can boot but little when we cannot depend on the immortality
of the sole.
HEEDLESS CHBONOLOOr.
A CONTBOVEHSY still rages about the date of the irrepressible
Athanasian Creed. This is superfluous if they are right who con-
sider the Creed of St. Athanasins out of date altogether.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
•r

0 -NIGHT. Mon-
day, Feb. 17,
LOBD CARNAR-
VON exposed the
humbug of the
promises by
which ignorant
emigrants are
allured to the
Brazils, where
they find that
they have been
victimised. LORD
GRANVILLE said
that, regardless
of making things
unpleasant with
foreign powers,
he had issued
certain warnings
against the temptations held out by interested agents. Our Consuls
had furnished him with trustworthy information. If some of the
"people's papers" would publish this kind of news, it might be as
useful to the "people" as stereotype abuse of all classes except
artisans.
The DUKE OF SOMERSET wished to know whether we were blunder-
ing in drawing the Afghan boundary. But here was "Duke upon
Duke." His Grace of Argyll informed His Grace of Somerset that
we had done nothing of the kind, and that the line was wisely drawn
along the Oxus, under the advice of SIR HENRY EAWLINSON. He
did not say anything about
"Samarcand by Oxus, TEMUE'S throne,"
which was a pity, because MILTON should always be quoted when
there is a chance. The line was sometime used in an Olympic play-
bill, in connection with a drama about the said TK.MUU or TIMOUR,
and this might have pleased MILTON, who was a friend to " the
well-trod stage."
Ma. A*ROYD called attention to the vast quantity of Coal which
is known to be in China. He wants the Flowery Nation to work at
its Coal-fields. We would rather hear of the Chinese labourer
toiling for Coal in his own land than in Wales, but there are pro-
posals to bring him over and 'make him do the work which the
Union tyrants forbid the Welsh labourer to do. We may see a
Joss-house in Merthyr-Tydvil yet.
Our Druid informed us that there is to be a Military Centre at
Oxford; not, however, exactly in any quad, but at a farm a short
distance from the City of Educational Palaces.
Then the ATTORNEY-GENERAL introduced his important measure
for the improvement of the Jury system. Now this, as every true
British orator knows, is the Palladium of British Liberty. But, as
very few British orators know what the classic word means, it may
be convenient to inform—or, shall we say, remind them that the
Palladium was a statue of the goddess Pallas, otherwise Minerva,
and that Troy was safe so long as that statue was preserved. Now,
two Grecian heroes, aware of the fact, did valiantly but secretly
make their way into Troy, and lay violent hands on the Palladium.
Tri'Ja fuit. Now, look again at Mr. Punch's Cartoon.
SIR JOHN'S proposals are to the effect that he would reduce the
sacred Twelve in the Box to Seven, except in cases of treason or
murder. He would improve the character of juries by mixing in the
box members of the Special and of the Common class. Mr. Punch
imagines that JOHN BULL will be enormously exercised by th« first
proposal, and the second seems to carry in it suicidal seed*. Will a
gentleman care to serve with a greengrocer, and will not a green-
grocer be jealous of the superior cultivation of the gentleman, and
as matter of principle refuse to be guided by him? There are sundry
other points on which SIR JOHN will have to fight hard, if he carries
his Bill, and the Lawyers are said to dislike it—a fact that may be
in favour of its character, but not of its chances.
In Supply, it was complained that we pay for the maintenance of
an imprisoned pirate chieftain called EMMANUEL BACCA, at Ascen-
sion. It was suggested that he should be brought here to prison,
but MR. IHxTKK said the fellow was best where he was " until he
should go to a better world." MR. BAXTER probably believes that
there is a chaplain at Ascension with considerable powers of conver-
sion. But why is not BACCA hanged,?
The Wife's Sister Bill was hurried through Committee, its ene-
mies avowing that they were eager to send it to meet its fate where
"A huge too-handed engine at the door
la ready to amita once, and smite no more."
Tuesday.—LORD BUCKHITRST moved the Second Reading of a Bill
for preventing Railway Accidents by compelling the Companies to
adopt the two systems which are found safest—the Block, and the
Interlocking of points or signals. Hardly needful to gay that it
was answered that excessive tenderness and delicacy must be shown
towards the Companies, or that the rude Bill was sent to a Select
Committee.
MR. AYRTOJT informed us that a contract for the Natural History
Museum at Kensington had been made, the edifice is to be finished in
three yean, and it is to cost £352,000. Beasts and birds have never
been so magnificently lodged since NOAH'S time.
But our .1'] tile can attend not only to the great but to the small,
and he is making a "bright little tight little island" in the Ser-
pentine, for the comfort of the Wild Fowl. We are glad of this,
as the national ganders will be able to keep out of the way of MB.
ODGER'S.
MR. VERWON HARCOURT then distinguished himself by moving
that our present public expenditure is excessive. He adduced a
variety of figures in proof of this, and showed how our outlay kept
on increasing. He reminded the Government that though they had
nobly redeemed some of their pledges, they had not redeemed their
vows to be economical, and he thought that Parliament ought to hold
them to these. A debate followed, the result of which was that MB.
GLADSTONE, refusing his assent to any abstract resolutions, agreed
to grant a Committee of Inquiry whether any reductions could be
made in the expenditure for the Civil Service, exclusive of what was
secured on the faith of national undertaking, as the interest on the
Debt, and the Civil List. This, of course, was accepted, "not,"
said MR. HARCOURT, "as half a loaf, but as a crumb under the
table."
Mr. Punch is so simple and sweet-minded and void of all guile,
that it quite pains him to see it hinted that both the Motion and the
Committee were intended as useful capital at the next election.
They will show, it is said, how truly zealous both the independent
Liberals and the Government are on the question of economy. He
can only say he wonders how persons can be so unkind us to suppose
that there is anything but true and disinterested patriotism in such
things. But he is altogether two soft-hearted and confiding for the
cold world.
Wednesday.—A Bill for improving the position of Woman in
regard to her property was read a Second Time, after severe debate,
and only by 121 to 103. And 0, dear Madam, if you would but just
look into the daily paper, and see what dreadful nonsense was talked
about interfering with the conjugal relation, and all that sort of
thing, and how dreadfully afraid some gentlemen are of allowing an
honest, hard-working woman to emancipate her means from the
control of an idle, drunken, profligate husband. For that is all that
is wanted, you know, Madam. If every.couple lived as you and
your beloved Barnabas live, faithfully fulfilling the marriage vow,
no laws to protect one from the other would be wanted. But every
man is not your Barnabas, and every woman is not his Belinda,
and then come cases where protection is wanted very much indeed.
The House seems inclined to take the reasonable view of the matter,
but grudgingly, and perhaps the antics of some of the strong-minded
women have rather set the legislative teeth on edge. It is unfair,
however, that good women should suffer through the bad taste of
fanatics.
Also we had a much wanted Bill for the protection and education
of agricultural children. MR. MUNDELLA made fun of it, but it is
at all events a step, etc.
Thursday.—LVB.V ROSEBERY made a very good speech about the
deterioration of our Horses, which seem to be coming down nearly
to the level of those who cheat with them and bet on them. He
wanted an inquiry. LORD GRANVILLE answered ROSKBKRY with
rose-colour, and thought that the horse population was going on well

enough. Anyhow, there is to be a Committee to ait on horses—if
they can. Some Lords are capital equestrians.'
In the Commons there was some debate connected with a most
serious matter—one so serious, in fact, that the honour of British
Commerce is concerned that certain statements should he disproved,
or, if proved, that the vengeance of Society should descend on the
guilty. MB. Pr.iMSOI.I,, Member for Derby, brings against certain
ship-owners the charge that they send to sea vessels that are either
not sea-worthy, or are so loaded as to be almost certain to sink, and
that this is done for the sake of the insurance-money. He has pub-
lished statements of the most terrible kind; and two Members of
Parliament, regarding themselves as among the accused, have
brought actions against him. Oar judgment and that of the public
ought to be held in entire suspense until the trials shall have taken
place. No investigation of so much national importance has been
made for years, and it becomes us all to watch, but to observe the
strictest fair-play. To-night the matter came up in the House be-
cause llu. PLIMSOLL was held to have committed a breach of privi-
lege in some of his writing on the subject. He admitted that he
had, disclaimed intent to offend the House, and frankly apologised.
The House felt, and MB. GLADSTONE admirably expressed its feeling,
that the issue was to be tried elsewhere, and that it was not on a
point of form that the topic should be treated.
COLOITEL KNOX elicited some cries by calling the trials at Dublin
for the Galway outrages " sham trials;" but it is difficult to know
what other epithet would have suited them. It is clear that the
form of the Tree-Box called the JJury-Box ought not to be tyranni-
cally cultivated in Ireland by the cow Id-heart ed Saxon. Its relative,
the "Gallows-Tree," has long ceased to be a terror there. And
MR. GLADSTONE boasts of having cut down the Upas-trees. Ireland
is clearly no longer a "Plantation." as of old.
Crime is to be prevented a little more. Some stringent clauses
are added to the present Act, which works very well, but which is
thought to be slightly aided by education, and by Kef ormatories that
cut off the supply of criminals.
Friday.—Owe Government will not allow Her Majesty's subjects
to wear Foreign Decorations. We have but one Fountain of
Honour, and it springs from the Throne. We recognise no alien
springs. There may be occasional inconvenience in this, but the
rule is good; and, moreover, Britons have a vague idea that some
Foreign Decorations, at least, are procurable through other channels
than those whence honour should flow. LOBD G m N v H.I.K did not
say this, but probably he thought it the more.
In the Commons the evening was dull, but, en revanche, it was
brief. A Committee was appointed to consider the mode in which
Government Stores are bought, the pleasing arrangement at present
being that Departments bid against each other, to the great profit of
Trade, but not of JOHN BULL.
MB. MrNbiai.\ obtained a Committee of Inquiry into the reasons
why Coal is so awfully dear. But only 22 men—we beg pardon-
Members were present. That, Madam, shows how your Representa-
tives attend to your business. MB. Linn KM, did not object to the
Collier asking a rise in wages when profits were high, but very
much objected to his declining to work a reasonable time because he
found his raised wages enough to support him in luxury without
his doing such work. The House was Counted Out in time for a late
dinner.
GREGORIAN TONES.
Our Thursday evening last there was what they called a " Gre-
gorian Demonstration" at St. Paul's. In answer to numerous
inquiries as to what on earth this means, we have much pleasure in
presenting pur Petitioners with some information on the subject.
The Gregorians, then, are a musical sect called after (as is evident)
the RET. CANON GBEGOBY, of St. Paul's, who, on this occasion, read
the Second Lesson in a Gregorian tone. By the way, the Minor
Canons' voices will be useful in dirges. Choirs wishing to take part
in the Gregorian movement, have to be in training for a month pre-
vious on Gregory's Powder. The Anglican Church Musical is
divided broadly, into two parties, the " Ain't-1-Gregorian!" and
the "Anti-Gregorian;" and, as the pugnacious Gregory says, in
Romeo and Juliet, "The weakest goes to the wall." _ Which this is
to be, is as yet uncertain. Being impartial, we wish well to the
two musical divisions of the surplice population.
Alas! Poor Carp!
A KAMoi s French Carp, dating from the time of FRANCIS THE
FIRST, aged three hundred and seventy-live years, and measuring
three feet in length, and two and a half in breadth, was attacked the
other day by an enormous pike and devoured. His poor fish bones,
we may suppose, lie in Jonah-like interment, and, were it possible
to catch the devouring pike and label him with an epitaph, he
should be made to carry this on his back,—
Requifscat in Puce.
WATERWORKS AND VANDALS.

E are apprised that we may safely trust the
Chelsea Waterworks Company, to take pare
of the scenery opposite to Hampton Court, in case Parliament is so
confiding, or so sympathetic, as to deliver it into the hands of the
Philistines? There may be Members for Mammon in the Legislature
capable of any sacrifice to that fiend. Bat, unless these constitute a
majority, it may be well that Noble Lords and Honourable Gentle-
men, invited to make the surrender above-named, should ponder the
subjoined statement in a letter addressed to the newspapers, under
the signature of " T. H. BBTANT." Then they will know what to
think of the Chelsea Waterworks Company :—
"In the year 1852 this very Company obtained powers to construct reser-
Toira, &c., at Seething WelU, close to the site now selected. By excavation
a very large mound was created in front of the residences facing the river.
£7 their Act they were required to remove this mound, but no penalty was
attached to it—it is twenty years ago. Would you believe it, that notwith-
standing every exertion of the Corporation of Kingston, and also of the
inhabitanta, and large sums of money subscribed, that that mound still remains
as a monument to this very Company of their interest in the public."
Let us hope that, as it may have been managed by benignant
Fates, the civilised 'Public, and especially the Corporation and all
the respectable inhabitants of Kingston and Surbiton, may have to
thank the Company for having applied to Parliament for licence to
ruin the view from Hampton Court and the "Mitre." By that
motion the said Association will possibly find that they have only
taken something for the offence of having maintained an eye-
sore, as sordid as those who created it, which said eyesore they
were required to remove by an imperfect Act of Parliament.
This cynical, shabby, and offensive neglect will perhaps not only
induce Parliament to throw out their present Waterworks Bill, but
also, for their benefit, that is to say, for their correction and amend-
ment, to enact another one in the interest of those who have been
aggrieved by their mean parsimony. By this supplementary Act,
maybe, the omission of that of 1852 will be supplied, and the
Chelsea Waterworks Company will be not only prevented from
spoiling half-a-mile of the scenery opposite to Hampton Court, but
also obliged, under a heavy penalty, to remove their "celebrated
mud-heap at Surbiton."
Saving Clauses.
IN the Convocation of York, the other day, the Proloontor took
occasion to remark that "it was a matter of thankfulness that, in
consequence of what had occurred outside and within the walls of
the two Lower Houses of Convocation, the Creed of St. Athanasius
had been "saved." If the Creed were sentient, it ought to be
grateful for such a requital of its suggestions in a perfectly opposite
direction.

A SKETCH IN ULSTERMARINE.
(And, looking at such Candidates for Marriage, say "Don't" to the Marines.)
STEALING THE PALLADIUM, OE SCOURING IT?
WHEN Ilion was rising on Pergamus' crown,
From the blue sky an image of Pallas dropt down,
With Gorgon-bossed buckler, and sejfis outspread,
And a spear in her hand, and a helm on her head.
And thus to King Ilus the oracle spake:—
"So long as this image your treasure you make,
And keep it intact in your citadel's shrine,
So long Troy shall stand under HUB'S line:
But if ever you let it be stolen, beware!
For then is the downfall of Troy in the air."
Time passed—Menelaus wed Helen—poor lad,
And Helen with Paris went off " to the bad,"
And as Priam at that time was Sovereign of Troy,
And as Paris, worse luok! was King Priam's pet boy,
And as, in those days, they 'd no Court of Divorce,
Where wrong'd lords to pay up co-respondents could force,
And as Paris when called on Madame to send home,
Said that those who would take her to take her must come,
Menelaus'a friends bade their friends to the fray,
Who in arms o'er the main against Troy took their way.
Where for ton years they battered the town, all in vain,
For why P Its Palladium the town did retain.
Now Ulysses was far the most 'onto of the Greeks,
Their deepest of dodgers, their slyest of sneaks;
So he wrought en one Diomed, feeble of wit,
But a rare 'un straight out from the shoulder to hit,
With him in a night-raid to hazard his crown,
To steal the Palladium,—trust of Troy-town.
Access to the Temple Ulysses secures,
In a dirtyish manner, along the main sewers;
The half-awake guards were cut down at their post,
The Palladium was cribbed—and Troy's talisman lost,
And, within the next six months, by Sinon done brown,
And humbugged by the Horse, haughty Troy had come down.
Old England has got her Palladium, like Troy,
At least, so I 've heard said, since old Punch was a boy.
This Palladium of ours is no image at all;
Nor, as far as I know was from Heaven seen to fall:
Bat it's something that's guarded with all sorts of looks,
And its form is Twelve Britons shut up in a Box,
Which Twelve are a Jury, and, till they agree,
Of not-guilty or guilty no verdict can be:
'Twas the Barons of Runnymede first clenched the same,
And made trial by peers the great stakes of their game.
And that's the Palladium, so-called, of JOHN BULL,
On which see Constitutional writers at full.
Is it true that two chiefs dare Old England to brave—
Childe COLBRIDOB the 'onto, and LOBD SBLBORNE the grave—
And have crept, like Ulysses and Diomed of yore,
Our Palladium to steal, up St. .Stephens'a shore 1J—
Have dared pick our best Constitutional looks,
And lay hands on the sacred Twelve men in a Box;
O'er whom, with her spear held defiant at ward,
Ears erect, and eyes open, Britannia holds guard,
And whom, if JOHN BULL, who as sentry should stand,
Lets be tampered with, shall claim redress at his hand,
For she knows, 'twixt the right and foul tyranny's flood,
How often that Box with its Twelve men has stood.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
But let's hope that 'tis not as Palladium prigs
Ulysses and 1 Homed now risk their wigs—
That if on the Box of the Twelve they lay hand,
It is lint to fix it more firm on its stand;
To its hinges, where rusted, to give freer play,
And brutli, here and there, an old cobweb away;
To its depths, where too close, to let in light and air,
So that Justice, in future, mayn't lose herself there.
And e'en if at last, by some work of new leaven,
The Twelve men in the Box should get stewed down to seven,
Don't let's think, with some faults in its framework removed,
The Palladium damaged, because it 'a improved.
SOCIETY ON STRIKE.
, K live in striking times;
there is no denying that.
Everybody seems to
have a tendency to
strike, and nobody can
say where this tendency
may lead us. In addi-
tion to our coal strike,
we may any morning
find ourselves afflicted
by a cab strike, and
shall esteem ourselves
quite fortunate if we
escape a cook strike. A
butcher's strike has
been reported from the
North, and in London
we have actually been
threatened by a baker's
strike. Who pan tell
but a Press strike may
be looming in the fu-
ture!' and fancy with
what horror the world
would hear the news
that there had been a
Punch strike!
At present strikes
have been confined to
what perhaps in irony are called the Working Classes: but it is highly probable
that the tendency to strike may gradually extend to other orders of Society,
where people live by mental as well as manual labour.
Considering the rising cost of fuel and provisions, a Curate strike ought surely

to be reckoned on the cards; and a Clerk strike must in
some quarters be looked upon as imminent. Why there
should not be a Doctors' strike in certain country neigh-
bourhoods, is more than we can say, seeing what low
salaries are paid for poor-house practice. A Governess
strike would likewise be excusable, we think, but pro-
bably would fail through lack of proper agitation.
There are many persons moving in fashionable circles
who yet may be described with correctness as belonging
to the Working Classes. Few labourers work harder
than an energetic dancer, or a daily diner-out, and the
labours of a chaperon in the middle of the season must
be well-nigh as exhausting as the labours of Hercules,
and pretty nearly as unprofitable in their actual result.
If a strike were to occur among the Upper Working
Classes, it is terrible to think how much Society would
suffer. Supposing that our friend TOM SITYLES, and half
a thousand like him, were suddenly to strike, and decline
all invitations, who would undergo the strictly manual
labour of handing down old LADY HUMGROTFYW to
dinner, and perform the mental work of entertaining
that dear creature through half a score of courses and ices
and dessert? And supposing HARRY GALLOPER, and all
the other good young active fellows who are kind enough
to do the dancing at our balls, were on a sudden to com-
bine, and form an Anti-Waltzing Union, or an Anti-
Evening-Party Club, with what terror would Society be
stricken at the news! As for poor over-worked Papas,
who, after slaving all day lone to pay for their girls'
dresses, are expected just at bedtime to escort their dar-
lings to a ball, and there to dance attendance on them
until nearly daylight,—as to these poor fellow-workmen
our virtuous indignation incites us to observe that, if
there be not soon a strike of Paterf amiliasses, they will
prove themselves deserving to be called by the two
syllables which complete that complex word.
OUR BEFBESENTATIVE MAN.
He addresses the Editor, as usual, after visiting the Globe, and
assisting at the representation of" Oriana"
A HER the discussion as to where You should be represented this
week, which terminated (the discussion, not the week) by your ob-
serving that You really did not care where I went to" (which some
tetchy folk might have taken unkindly, though I didn't). I consulted
the papers to see what was going on in the Theatrical World. I
found a good deal going on which I thought had been on the point
of stepping, and I ascertained that the latest novelty was Oriana at
the Globe. Now, Sir, I had not seen Old Soldiers at the Strand,
nor Old London at the Queen's: two old, but both new: except,
by the way, that Les Chevalier* du Srouillard, which is Old
London, will be found fully reviewed in this journal about five years
Then there was The School for Scandal at the Vaudeville,
which, as representing You, I thought would keep for some con-
siderable time longer; and there were HBRR and MRS. I! \ \ i> M i xx,
or, as my friend WAGG, who doesn't know anything of German pro-
nunciation, says " Missus and Her Sandman," or " Her and She"
(which reminds me that Man and Wife will be out at the Prince of
Wales's Theatre before this appears), in Hamlet, at the Princess's,
for nine times only—a nine days' wonder—and, in fact, so many
attractions East and West that I hesitated whether to go to the
Globe for Oriana, or somewhere else, or nowhere at all. I looked
at the criticisms in the papers. One intimated that Oriana had been
nearly laughed off the stage on the first night; another, that an
increased ballet might make it an agreeable after-piece, which was
hard upon a Romantic Legend or Fairy Comedy (as it was at first
advertised) in three acts of mingled—or muddled—prose, blank
verse, and rhyme. Another critic abused the audience for deriding
all that was intended by the author to be taken seriously, and
praised the piece with reservations. Another praised it all unreserv-
edly, and, indeed, had not laudation sufficient for its transcendent
merits. Puzzled by all this, and seeing the day fast slipping away
without my being able to come to any decision as to where I should
represent You, I was on the point of throwing up all theatrical
entertainments, and devoting myself to going to hear a celebrated
musician, with whose name I was totally unacquainted, perform, as
he was announced to do, on the " new Ebonite Cylinder at Wim-
bledon, which, it occurred to me, would be a real treat, specially if
he were accompanied on the Bolophone and the Digitoventolopho-
nium (a sweet thing for an amatory duett between a gentle Ichthyo-
saurus and an accomplished Mastodon), when a friend said to me,
"If you've not seen Oriana, don't! and another, immediately
afterwards, said, "If you've not seen Oriana, do!" and so, finding
that the Ebonite Cylindrical performance was not coming off that
evening, I settled upon representing You, Sir, judicially, at the
Globe Theatre.
Oriana, then, is an undramatic poem set to music. What may be
called the fairy part of the poem is fanciful and pretty. Much that
Peep the fairy has to say would deserve higher praise than this,
were it not that one is constantly reminded of the author's efforts,
in straining after originality, to free himself from 'the haunting
recollection of the Fays of DRAYTOW and BEN JONSOX, of Mercutio's
description of Queen Mob, of Ariel, Puck, and the whole army of
tiny trioksome spirits to whom the Master Hand gave immortauty.
That part of the poem which is about King Raymond and his Queen
Oriana, is Tennysonian. What is intended for the comic portion,
and given to Oxtye the demagogue and his loutish followers, so
forcibly recalls Bottom and his associates, that one is expecting to
see them set to work to rehearse Pyramus and Thisbe; but, alas!
they do nothing a quarter so amusing. The patchwork of prose,
blank verse, and rhyme, indiscriminately, is a mistake. The
rhyming portion should have been kept exclusively to the fairy's
speeches, and the vocal music should have been confined to the
spirits. 1 Hank verse should have been the form for the more serious
personages of the poem, and prose for the low comedians. But to
expect an artistic whole out of a sort of haphazard jumble of
rhyming words, hard prose, instrumental music, blank verse, unex-
pected songs, and occasional dances, is to rub on to the canvas a
confused smudge of various colours and to look for the glorious
effect of .a CLAUDE'S sunset. I have no doubt but that, as rehearsed
singly, every patch was charming by itself, and that with it, author,
composer, and actor were alike delighted. Oriana, to be enjoyed,
must be read, not seen, and then the comic part must be skipped.
However, Your Representative has to deal with it in its published
form on the Globe stage.
Well, then, seeing the prominence of Peep the fairy's part, I will
begin with her. It is played by Miss CARLOTTA ADDISON. It is the
best-played part in the piece; but, it is the best part—;or, rather, it
is the only part. Yet what is she to represent? A crippled fairy,

limping on a crutch. Old Witches limped and hobbled on oruteh-
handled sticks, bat they were hags, and mortal, not Sprites or Fays.
Bat! imagine Puck with a bruised arm because he couldn't get out
of the way of the Miller's flail, or an Ariel with a wooden leg, in
consequence of a fall from a bat! No, it won't do; to begin with,
it won't do. Yoloan was kicked out of Heaven, and limped; but
Vulcan wasn't a Spenserian faery. Miss ADDISON, again, does not
look a fairy. Now, Miss TEBUY did look Puck, and Miss HODSON,
artfully costumed, was a very fair impersonation of the stage Ariel;
and, by the way, even Titania and Ooeron were well represented in
the revival of Midsummer Nighfs Dream at the Queen's. So that,
in spite of the antecedent improbability, fairy forms (out of extrava-
ganza and burlesque) can be tolerably well presented on the stage.
Fairy Peep, however, in Oriana, looks like a distraught peasant-
girl, who had robbed a booth to supply herself with tawdry
trimming, had lamed herself by escaping from the window of some
neighbouring lunatic asylum, and was wandering about the country
with an ear-trumpet (by way of something sporting) and a fraction
of a hop-pole. This is certainly not the author's fault, unless he
designed the costume, or approved such a design. As for the rest,
personages they were, characters they were not, except MB.
FiocKTOW as the Fool, Solon, who from the first reminded me,
both in gait and appearance, of MR. IRVING, and who did not,
therefore, surprise me when he gave the audience the key to his
reading of the part by exclaiming " Hark! the bells!" which ought,
just to have enlivened the proceedings a bit, to have been the cue
for an imitation; bat, I regret to say, it wasn't. Oriana being
comparatively nobody, and Peep everybody, and seeing that the
great point is the charmed well, I should recommend a change of
name for the piece. Let it be a Fairy Operatic Extravaganza, with
lively music pi the Nobody-knov>ts-a»- I-do and Aget-ago style, and let
it be called, instead of Oriana, Little Bo-Peep,m Leave Well Alone.
At present 'tis neither play nor opera. You are disappointed
with it as an opera, because there is too much dialogue; you are
disappointed with it as a play, because there is too much music.
Let the piece be reduced to an hour and a quarter's duration, and
re-oast, with singers. I should suggest, as likely to hit the public,
the following names:—King Raymond, MR. SIMS REEVES; Queen
Oriana, Miss BUILT SOLDENE (unless she played Raymond, and the
whole thing was extravaganza'd): Oxeye, with a buffo song, might
be MR. GEOEOK HONKY. I should out out the Bishop entirely, or, if
he grumbled, he could have a ballet to himself, with cymbals. Peep
might be well played by an intelligent grandson of MASTER PERCY
ROSBLLE, and there should be a chorus of fairies by the choristers
from EVANS'S, to sing something as catchy as "Spring. Spring,
beautiful Spring." MR. COLLODION, the caricaturist, will, I believe,
be shortly disengaged, and he might be thrown in somehow. At all
events, he 'd draw.
One thing most seriously be said for MR. ALBERT'S Romantic
Legend, which is, that it is entirely free from anything in the
remotest degree approaching a vein of coarseness.
This delicacy of treatment is especially to be noticed in the four
situations of the piece; first, where the King falls in love with
Chlni;, then with the Bishop, then with himself, and, lastly, where
the Queen becomes enamoured of Oxeye. In these a less pure and
poetic mind might have been tempted to say coarsely all that the
sensual aspect of the occasion could suggest, and would have been
content to leave nothing to the imagination. This slough MR.
ALBERT has avoided; and there is not, from beginning to end, one
single line which I would not trust my Maiden Aunt from Clapham
to hear, and, having heard, to return thither in the last omnibus
with her spotless umbrella and a firmer faith in the love and truth
of her only nephew.
So much, Sir, for representing You at Oriiina. As to its success-
well, in theatrical matters no one can say what will or what won't
catch the public. Were I the Manager of the Globe, I should hope
for the best, and be prepared for the worst. Farewell for the
present. I am ever YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.

THE LAMBETH TEMPEBANCE LEAGUE.
LET us drink an Institution, likeliest to promote sobriety.
Here's to the new-founded Church of England Temperance Society:
For the Church of this realm doth, besides as no denomination,
Commend, and counsel, and set forth, always, in all things,
moderation.
Most chiefly is the Church's moderation shown strong drinks in using;
Not, as do some that greatly err, eschewing such, but not abusing,
She doth reprove all sots, and them like swine that in their swill lie
sunken;
But praiseth them that make good cheer, yet drink so that they be
not drunken.
That wine is good the Church doth prove from many a place beyond
all question.
It strengtheneth the heart of Man ; to some is needful for digestion:
So likewise those good creatures all which at sound doctrine by some
stickers,
As the Teetotallers do vainly talk, be called " intoxicating liquors."
Intemperance as concerning, this the Church of England further
teaches—
They are to be condemned that make on Temperance stumps intem-
perate speeches.
Rave over Christian Liberty for leave to exercise dominion,
Drunk without drink on vanity, and puffed up with self-opinion.
The Church good measures loveth, and instead of banning pint or
pottle,
The canticle doth much applaud that biddeth all men with a bottle,
And that a jolly and a full, they arm themselves at festive season;
So as eftsoons to empt the same by draughts within the bounds of
reason.
Now fill we np another glass, and drink His Grace of Canterbury.
May he take order for sound port, unbrandied, and as well for sherry,
Sit h, as Archbishop he doth rule the Temperance Church Association;
Thence orthodoxy shall increase, with decrease of intoxication.
A PARAGRAPH TRAP.
As an old bird we are not often caught with chaff. We are never
taken with it at any time, considering it, as regards repartee, in the
ratio of the horseplay of an English poalheaver's fisticuffs to the
dexterous handlingof a French courtier's jteurette. So much for
chaff, in passing. The form of the bait wherewith we were trapped
was not, on consideration, novel; but it was new to find it in a
corner of the Times, at the tail of an otherwise interesting para-
graph, which was headed "An Anglo-Moorish Marriage." After
an amusingly curious account of such scant ceremony as seems to
have taken place, the account concludes with the information that
the wedding-breakfast was on this occasion supplied by a certain
hotel at Tangier, which provides " capital accommodation on reason-
able terms," &q., with a further personal recommendation of the
landlord and his wife. "I can't conceive," said Mr. Crummies,
after reading the startling and laudatory notices about himself in
the local papers, "who puts these things in. I didn't." If the
whole story is a romance, so much cleverer is the advertisement. If
not, greatly to be admired is the skill which has turned the incident
to so practical an account. We can imagine an infinity of devices on
this foundation, namely: "Celebration of the Eighteenth Birthday
of a Hindoo Princess." which should be a boot and shoemaker's
advertisement; then Religious Ceremonies on the Coming of Age
of an Egyptian Eldest Son," which should lead up to a publication
of some hosier's and outfitter's wares. "Presence of Mind in India,"
showing how a tiger was frightened by an umbrella, would, of
course,'oe an evident opportunity, and so on. They must be well
done, however, and an improvement on former attempts. The
present model herein noticed is excellent. .Only henceforth we shall
be inclined to regard with a more than ordinarily wary eye any very
attractive heading in Paragraph Corner.

VENUS VAUNTETH HER.
(A propos of Her coming Transit.)
THEY may sneer at me as passSe, as a belle of bygone fashion,
Who once had my adorers, but am now left in the cold.
Like some pale wall-flower, wooed of yore with poetry and passion,
Now left on ball-room bench, unhid out of the chaperon's fold.
But that Venus still is somebody for men to make a fuss about,
E'en in this generation of materialists and muffs,
Is plain, when, only to behold her passing, folks thus rush about,
And how, when, where to watch her, learned pundits come to cuffs.
Yes, my boudoirs in fair .Cyprus may by coarse hands have been
shattered,
And New Yorkers their museum be enriching from my shrine-
Since that rude GENERAL CESNOLA its treasure-trove has scattered—
In Art, as well as dry goods, with the desperate hope to shine.
Still, though my faith be fallen, and though my fanes have vanished,
Venus still holds her Heaven, to which men's thoughts and eyes
yet run;
Nor from the lists of Science is the Queen of Beauty banished,
But holds Old World and New at gaze to see her cross the Sun.
Yes, I can still make learned heads with eager passion airy;
Bring a persistent proctor at my summons to his knee:
Can launch ships for Antarctic, Isles, penguinny and white-beary,
To pass a six months' winter dark, for one day's sight of me:
And all because they fancy, poor idiots, that Venus
Is the best of heavenly bodies to attack with their base-line;
As if there ever could be aught of interchange between us,
But mute observance on their part, and loftiness on mine!
At least you own the majesty of her whom thus you follow.
When 'tis by her you measure all the greatness that you know;
When 'tis she who gives the standard of proportions for Apollo,
And binds him down to take the length of her string for his bow.
Still Venus is the sovereign power of high as lower regions,
Still spans and scales the universe by ruling of her charms,
And as erst for Helen's loveliness she fired the Greeks and Phrygians,
So now her Transit calls the world of science up in arms.
A STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.
UP to the present hour we have had a good opinion of Japan, as a
country daily becoming more and more polished and civilised, and
likely in due time to enjoy all the distinctions and advantages of
Strikes, Select Vestries, Convocation, Four-wheeled Cabs, Superfine
Black Silk Hats, a Court Circular, and a permanent Income-tax.
But our faith has been rudely shaken. We are not so sure of the
improvement in Japan, after reading the almost incredible announce-
ment that, amongst other innovations lately introduced there, "a
holiday is to be kept on every seventh day instead of on every fifth
day"! What can be expected from a nation which voluntarily
deprives itself of twenty-one days of leisure and relaxation from
work in the course of a single year? Such a statement might have

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARL

THE CREAM OF DEVONSHIRE.
THE advowson of the rectory of Dodbrooke was recently
put up for sale by public auction, but although "de-
scribed as one of the loveliest sites in Devon, with only
one Dissenting chapel in the parish," it failed to find a
purchaser. Beautiful scenery, and the slightest possible
Nonconformity, could not raise the biddings beyond
£920. Perhaps a trout stream, or a pack of otter hounds
within an easy distance, or a well-walled fruit garden,
or excellent society in the immediate neighbourhood,
might have made Dodbrooke more saleable, and saved
it from the indignity of being " bought in at £1000."
There may have been another reason why the bidding
was so slow. "The auctioneer declared he could only
account for it by fears which might be entertained with
regard to future legislation, and endeavoured to
encourage the company by assuring them that "no
legislation in England could ever destroy vested
interests." If such scandals as the open sale of Church
livings in public auction rooms are continued, the
Church itself maybe found to be " going, going—gone!"
sooner than is expected.

use on an English Railway was used on the journey from
Glasgow to London on Monday night, and arrived at the
Great Northern Terminus, Kind's Cross, at eight I'.M.
Success to Railway Sleeping Carnages. Pleasant dreams
to those who sleep in them. They will always travel in
their dreams, and sometimes different ways. Hereto-
fore railway sleepers have mostly occupied a stationary
position below the wheels. May the sleepers in transit
repose as securely as those in site, and may the former
never awake to find themselves in a situation of
unpleasant contiguity to the latter.

POOE WILLIAM AND PLAYFUL PADDY.
WITH a ditty full of pity to bemoan him I '11 make free,
Whose vocation legislation for Ireland comes to be.
Where A's white light is B's black night, and B's right is A's
wrong;
And reasons go by seasons, weak to-day, to-morrow strong;
And everybody argues, and nobody agrees.
And those your work are first to burke, whom your work was meant
to please:
And the crathers— such their nathers—turn to kick if you caress
them,
And in challenge trail the new coat's tail, in which you 've toiled to
dress them;
And when for peace, that strife may cease, you brave the plagues of
martyrs.
With shrill " Hurroo!" and " Croom-a-boo," they rush to cuffs like
Tartars 1
If Parliament time be a Pantomime—as says some scoffing joker,—
One thing the Clown had best put down—that's Pat—the red-hot
poker!
Poor WILLIAM see; how painfully his Irish University
He's seasoned up, and reasoned up, what need that Punch rehearse
ityel
A good rich slice, to make it nice, of Trinity plum-pudding;
A Galway fish, to crown the dish, for Ultramontane grubbing;
Snug bursaries,—precursories of prizes of more volume meant;
A fountain I Itramountain of honour and emolument;
The History chair—that blistery chair for rival Churches—banished;
Ditto Morals, lest for quarrels it might stand, its morals vanished;
Each lecturer—a picture here of Liberalism's dominion—
(fleets to puzzle) in a muzzle, that he bite no man's opinion;
Sore was never scheme so clever, to please each denomination,
And lo 1 the end is not a friend 'twixt it and execration!
The fate of fools between two stools, we know, is downfall fitting:
Then tell me what must be his lot who on four stools tries sitting?
And that is where, 'twixt earth and air, my WILLIAM seems to be
'Twixt mild MAOKK, proud Trinity, godless ft. and grim R. C. now:
A modus to patch, and a peace to natch, out of centuries' brawl and
battle:
From pigs shear wools, turn Papal bulls into harmless, hornless
cattle:
Coax black and white at length to unite, since neither in the lurch is;
! And make the 'ologies, with apologies, knuckle down to the Churches.
But storms are near, to blast, I fear, hopes of millennial weather,
With lambs and lions in sweet alliance in Academe together.
And the self-same fate, methinks, will await those who 'd foster this
peace-germ. Sirs,
As waits all who 'd run two extremes into one, without a common
term, Sin.
PLEASURES OF HOPE.
GIVING sixpence to an organ-grinder, when you are hard at head
work, in the illusive hope of purchasing his silence; and then find-
ing him repeating his call regularly at precisely the same hour, and
playing with marked emphasis close before your door-step.
Running errands for your Aunt, and petting her asthmatic pug-
dog, in the hope that at her death yon will be liberally rewarded;
and discovering, after all, that she has lived on an annuity, and died
very nearly penniless.
Putting off and putting off a call upon your coal-merchant, in the
vain ana feeble hope of prices coming down; and finding, in the
end, that the greatest rise has happened exactly on the day when
you are burning your last scuttle!'ul, and are compelled to give an
order.
Hurrying home to dinner with a splendidly fine appetite, which
you cannot avoid hoping will be worthily appeased; and, alas! dis-
! covering that thei piece de resistance is cold mutton.
Hailing a passing Hansom in the hope to catch your train, for
> which you are already late, and finding that the horse is an incorri-
I gible jibber.

happy to say, came his Friend, MB. JOHN
BRIGHT. He looked very well, and took bis
old Beat at the corner of the second bench
below the gangway. By the way, in that
most useful book, Debretfi Illtittrated House
of Commons, wherein not only is all bio-
graphical and political information touching
onr Collective Wisdom, but also its heraldry,
the shield of the RIGHT HON. JOHN BRIGHT
is a blank. But -why no device? Doth he
not recognise such a thing as a shield? It
means but a defence, which is permitted to
all of ns. At least let him have One Ash
blazoned thereon, and for his motto,
linglit in Z-eal.
(Troittu and Crttsidi.)
MR. CHICITESTER FORTKSCD-B said that it
would be premature to say that Government
would not bring in a Bill establishing the use
of Metric Weights and Measures. A neatly
guarded answer, of the old Peel pattern. But
touching a new system, Madam F When it
is as much as one can do now, with the aid of
fingers, to reckon how many pennyweights go
to a grain (or is it the other way P) it is cruel
to talk of onr learning more tables. Some-
thing shocking will occur if too many prob-
lems are set us. Do you remember the school-
master who hanged himself because he onuld
not find out why the Greek Zeus makes Dios
'•« in the genitive case?
Asked by SIR J. ELPHINSTOSS about the
Affghan boundary, MR. GLADSTONE said that we could not get in Central Asia that definiteness of territorial limitation (good dictionary
words, M'm) which might be expected in civilised countries. We should have thought that it was easiest to map oat a country where
there are no oldest inhabitants to bother with their infirm reminiscences of beating the bounds. MR. GLADSTONE also said that it had
been urged that AKUA 11 AM '* erecting an altar showed that he had landed property where it stood. May be so. We dare say that a good
many worse people than ABRAHAM would be too happy to erect altars if they proved ownership in land.
COLONEL BAHTTELOT moved that, in the opinion of the House, the servioe of regiments in India ought to be shortened. He was
entirely wrong. Servioe in India is very popular with the British soldier, and when he comes home he often wishes that he had remained
among the souls made of fire and children of the sun.
MR. BRIGHT listened up to this point, but then had enough of it. Abiit, erumpit. After some more talk on the subject, the Motion
was withdrawn, and
MR. CARDWBLL presented the Army Estimates. We save £408,000 this year, and last year we saved £1,072,000. But in the present
year we should have saved £400,000 more, but for the abominably high prices of everything. However, that is a trifle when we look at
the total amount. Madam, MR. CARDWELL wants Thirteen Millions and a Quarter. But then see. For that sum he provides you with a
noble Army of 125,004 men (there go the odd fo\ir past Mr, Punch's window as he writes—very fine fellows, and the nursery-maids wheel
the perambulators into the mud-heaps while regarding the gallant defenders of our hearths and the rest of our premises), and he could
give you 462,754.
Desertion, like the personage abolished by LORD WESTBTTRT, is not so black as painted. We are not pushing recruiting hotly, as we
have already all the men we ask for. _ The soldiers looked splendidly at the Autumn Manoeuvres, which, by the way, are this year to be
held in the hoard. J-in space in Leicester Square—a secret Punch was asked to keep, but can keep no longer.
MBS. MALAPROF'S friends, the Malicious, are 129,000 strong, and mostly ugly. But listen.
There has been a considerable falling off in the numbers of the Volunteers.
This is a matter demanding a serious word, and though our excellent and amiable Druid found consolation in the fact that those who
remain in the Volunteer ranks are more "efficient" than before, that is not enough. The fact is that the Volunteers have never been
properly taken in hand by the State, and it will be necessary to speak out upon the subject. The mass of the Volunteers do not want to
Flay at Soldiers, but to become soldiers with whom an enemy would rind an encounter no play.
Punch is exceedingly dissatisfied that there is no .certainty of a Volunteer Review this year, and he may have a crow to pluck with
some people who crow in a fashion that offends him.
To conclude the story of the Estimates. There is to be some manipulation in the mode of paying the Soldier. He has at present Is. 2d.
a day, and a Id. for beer when at home stations. But from this I W. is taken away for rations. MR. CARDWELL says that he shall have
a clear Shilling. This sounded well, and the Committee cheered; but there's a sequel at the heels in the shape of a deduction for
groceries, and on another night it was explained that the Soldier's gain would be a Halfpenny, and, in some cases, a Farthing. This
does not seem a result calling on the nation or the Soldiers for any monstrous burst of grateful enthusiasm.
Lastly, there is to be a sort of Chief of the Staff, or Head of the Military Intelligence Department. He is to he attached to the DUKE
OF CAMBRIDGE, which does not mean that he is to love II. It.II. (though most of his friends do), or that he is to be tied with strings
to the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. But he is to be his confidant and counsellor, and to be able to tell H.R.H. anything, at a second's
notice, from the reason why an elephant in an Indian baggage-train has a cold in his trunk, down to the reason why Private FOOTWOB-
BLKK nt' the 316th has thrown over the blue-eyed cook at No. 17, Alphonso Villas, Singin's Wood, N. W. He is to have military om-
niscience, in fact. Which it is easy to enact, bat where is the wonderful man P Mr. Punch could get up the whole subject in a week,
of course, but he has other duties now.
'There is no one beside him and no one above him,
He standeth alone, as the nightingale aings."
SIR JOHN PAKINGTON complimented Ma. CAHDWELL, but politely hoped that he would not object to Discerning Criticism on his plans.

MARCH 8, 1873.]
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Shrnve Tuesday.—Again the Lords took things easy, but in the
first place they had no chance of taking them hard, and in the next
Punch would condone almost anything they could do, in considera-
tion of what they did do forty-eight hours later.
LORD HARTINGTOW told the Commons that Ministers did not mean
to prosecute any more of the priestly or other offenders whom Ma.
JUSTICE KEOOH recommended to the attention of a jury. So that
farce is played oat. Such a termination might have been.foreseen.
Trial by Jury does not suit the Irish nature, and the best way to try
Irishmen charged with anything at all connected with their religion,
will be to change the venue to the Central Criminal Court. There
they will in many case* be acquitted, no doubt, but it will be for a
reason which can be accepted by rational men.
MB. GLADSTONE moving that the House should not meet till two
next day, Ash-Wednesday,
MB. PETF.U TATLOB got up, and objected to delaying business
because a portion of the House wished to go to Church. This eminent
Christian then decently bracketted that wish with the desire for
adjournment on the Derby Day, which he thought equally unreason-
able. It was the kind of thing to be expected from the sentimental
gentleman who blubs over bellowing garotters. The reporters say
he raised ironical cheers from all parts of the House. But " irony"
to MB. PETEB TAYLOR! There were 222 who chose to show respect
to religion against 56 who followed PETER into the lobby.
We then had a debate as to the propriety of calling Parliaments
together for an early session in November. Good Jupiter I isn't
there talk enough already? However, the idea was scouted.
MB. SEELY raised an ^Admiralty debate, and said wise things,
•which it was MR. GOSCHEN'S business to prove were unwise. He
did not exactly succeed in this, but he got a majority of 114 to 13,
so the First Lord went off under a salute of 101 guns.
Ash Wednesday.—We went to Church. We threw out by 181 to
48 a Scotch Poor Law Bill, and then we peacefully retired to our
home to eat salt fish with egg-sauce,—PETER TAYLOR not having
prohibited this.
Thursday.—The Peers of England did their duty. They mustered
in full force, at the call of LOBD SALISBURY, to execute sentence upon
that Bill for Disfiguring the Thames at Hampton Court.
"Sharp was the blade, and sure the blow,
And short the pang to undergo."
LOBD Fm-WALTEB—he was SIB BKOOK BRIDGES—moved the
Second Beading, and begged the Lords to let the Bill go to a Com-
mittee ;—the plan was not nearly so bad as had been said, and then
the poor Company was bound to find water for a lot of parishes, and
— here was a good bit of Philistinism—the plan did not affect Resi-
dential Property.
Up rose LORD SALISBURY, and, to do him justice, he had a
desperate struggle with himself to avoid being too uncivil, after such
an opening speech. But justice and instinct were too strong for
him, and he soon began to lay on nobly. Mr. Punch, standing by
the Throne, cheered him without the slightest regard to place or
propriety, and has rewarded him with a Cartoon which will be his
glory till he gets the Garter, perhaps afterwards. His Lordship
demanded the rejection of the Bill.
LORD GBAKYILLE did not please us. He could not form an
opinion,—people contradicted one another,—wouldn't it be better to
let a Committee decide P
The MARQUIS OF HERTFORD, on behalf of the thousands who
resort to Hampton Court, voted for rejection. So did
LORD MIDLETON, who, moreover, said he had no reason to feel
confidence in the Company's professions.
EARL GREY, of course, was against the view taken by non-
crotchetty men, and deprecated excitement.
The DUKE OF RICHMOND utterly condemned the BUL
LORD K i: i IF.S i> \ i ,K would not vote.
LORD GBANVTLLE asked LORD Fm-WALTER whether he would
undertake that the Company would leave the bank and trees intact,
and the latter Lord promised this, whereon
LORD SALISBURY, having cut down his enemy with his sword,
stuck the dagger of mercy into his eye by observing that before a
Committee there would be nobody to force the Company to keep its
word, and then a division was taken, and
The Disfigurement Bill was thrown out by 70 to 29. Punch
wonders whether the Park patriots will have one decent word to say
about this act on the part of the bullying aristocrats and bloated
bishops, who exist only to oppress the "Sons of Toil."
The Commons made a night of it, chiefly on the Estimates, MR.
FOWLER wishing to reduce our Army by 10,000 men. Bat a very
important Bili for constituting a Council of Three, with power to
superintend the Railway system, and compel the Companies In do
their duty by the public and each other, was actually read a Second
Time. The news is good and yet true. Will not the Railway men
wake up yet, and fight for their tyrannies? Why, under this Bill,
the Three might exclude the Juggernaut Vans from the principal
streets during the hours when civilised men and women want them 1
Friday.—MR. MACFIB made a speech about our relations with the
Colonies, and humanely cut it short on hearing the imploring cries
of the afflicted Members. Such laments would have drawn
"Iron tears down Pluto's cheek."
LORD BURY said that the Colonial Society had not accredited
MB. MACFIE as their representative. His Motion was withdrawn.
Then we nearly got into a muddle, for SIB JOB* PAKINGTON and
MR. CARDWELL were to have it out upon the Estimates, and neither
was present. The attendance of other Members was very small.
But the missing leaders came in, and we got to work at last, and after
a queer speech from SIR W. LAWSON, who urged the wickedness of
inventing machines to kill our fellow-creatures, and how nice it
would be in MR. GLADSTONE to be the Apostle of Disarmament, we
rejected, by 158 to 43, MR. KOWLEK'S proposal to weaken our Army,
and we voted a good deal of money for military purposes.
Be it added that DR. CCLLKN and a number of other Catholic
hierarchs in Ireland have declared war on the Irish Education Bill.
This seems the best possible reason why a British Parliament should
pass it. Laudari laudatis may be reversed with significance, pro
htic rice.

President of Examiners (angrily). Certainly, Sir: and, if I must
use still plainer language, I may tell you that your recent perform-
ance is a disgrace to yourself, and an insult to the University.
O'Tomnoddy (with increasing politeness). Might I ask for speci-
mens from the papers which have incurred such opprobrium.
President of Examiners. You may, Sir, though it is not our usual
practice to furnish them. I find that you translate Citsar transivit
Alpes summd diligentia by " C.KSAK crossed the Alps on the top of a
diligence ;" that you state that" HAGAR was an Ishmaelite indeed,
in whom there was no guile;" in astronomy you assert that "the
earth is a square plane round which the heavenly bodies revolve ;"
and that in modern history you say that " JOHN HAMPDEN was the
architect of Hampden Court Palace"
O'Tomnoddy (rising indignantly). And it is for this that I am
plucked? Allow me to tell you, Gentlemen, that these my theories
have been held by wiser men than you or I; and allow me to remind
you that the Act to which yon owe your existence as Examiners
provides in my defence that no disqualification shall attach to me
for adopting any particular theory in preference to any other
received theory. By plucking me, Gentlemen, yon have violated an
Act of Parliament: by such violation you are guilty of a misde-
meanour, and it is the duty of the ATTORNEY-GENERAL to prosecute
you (HAHCOURT, C. J., in Odgerv. Ayrton); and I, for my part,
will take care that he fulfils his duty.
[ The Examiners tremble; instantly give MR. O'TOMNODDY his
degree, and appoint him to a fellowship under Clause 24 of

TO THE NYMPHS OF THAMES.
(Tn Memory of the Chelsea Water-Work* Bill, for embanking the
Thames opposite Hampton Court, thrown out in the House of
Lords, Thursday, February 27.)
NAIADS of Thames, that in May's moonlit evei
Sport swanlike with the swans in rushy bowers,
Or under flickering veil of willow-leaves
Lave your white limbs in sleepy summer hours,
Rejoice, that still you may behold the towers
'if WOI.SKY'S flower-girt pile, reflected fair
In Thames' glass, set in a green margent, bare
Of their vile load, that sought usurping powers
To chain your stream, and clip its reaches rare
With rigid roods of brick-work straight and square!
Still shall yon minister the pure delight _
Of blossomed bank, lush meadow, devious stream,
To weary wayfarer and toil-worn wight.
Who for long months beholds not, save in dream,
Nature's fair face, athwart the smoke and steam
Of the choked City: still shall your glad eyes
• Watch happy lovers, changing smiles and sighs,
In tune with the broad river's gloom and gleam,
And all joy that exults, or restful lies,
Where Thames clear reaches mirror clearer skies.
He thought to drive you from your rushy nooks,
Trusted in your green hannte to make his hold,
The Hydra—that with hundred heads and hooks,
Boasts strength to crush with ever-widening fold:
Ever he craves for prey; and, grown more bold,
The more men cower before his open jaws,
Takes his usurping appetites for laws;
And ramping ever more and more for gold,
Deems not that Nymphs of Thames can give him pause,
And find a Hercules to assert their cause.
Bat lo! Thames' Nymphs their Hercules have found,
To grapple with the Hydra—in despite
Of maws that hiss, and claws that clutch the ground—
And bear him to the ground in foughten fight!
Beaten and breathless, fain the dust to bite,
Shorn of his strength, and baffled of his aims,
Crushed all his heads, his strengths all turned to shames,
He lies, a thing to mock, not to affright,
While all the host that haunts and loves the Thames,
Its gratitude to Hercules proclaims.
SHA.KSPEA.RE ON THE STRIKE.
OUK friend, W. 8., who has a word in. season for everybody, says,
in Loves Labour 'a Lost:—
"Are Colliers counted Bright?"
_ Making this a question, we propose to let him make answer unto
himself. Judging by their present suicidal course, Punch would
say, from the same play :—
"I dare not call them Fools, but thii I think,
When they are thirsty, Fools would fain hare drink."
And, by the way, they are generally thirsty, but, according to ac-
counts, despising the poor creature, Small Beer, they quench, their
thirst in draughts of what they are pleased to call " fizz," but what
is known in civilised society as Champagne. Well, set certain people
on horseback, and we know the end of their ride.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN,
Assists at the first representation of " Man and Wife," and
addresses the Editor as usual.
UKSF.NT was I at
the premiere of
Man and Wife
at the Prince of
Wales's. To say
this, is to say
that MB. and
Mas. BANCBOFT,
with their gene-
rally excellent
company, play-
ed a piece which
MB. WILDE
COLLINS had
dramatised from
his own novel,
or which he
had previously
novelised from
his own subse-
quently - pro-
duced drama;
and to say all
this is equiva-
lent to announc-
ing my assist-
ance at a Prince
x *..v of Wales's Suc-
\^ — -';w«,w But this is a
special occasion,
when, as representing You, Sir, "I am nothing, if not critical."
I will, therefore, commence by mentioning ajfact, and then dis-
missing it, in order to proceed with my analysis. This fact, then,
is, that the success of Man and Wife is mainly due to the ingenuity
displayed by the author in sustaining the interest in the latter part
of the Fourth Act, and to the acting of MB. COGHLAN, whose consum-
mate art was shown In his masterly impersonation of a character
which is, perhaps, without exception, the most brutal and unsym-
pathetic ever seen on the English Stage. logo is a fool to him:
besides logo is witty, and sings a song. As it is possible to love the
sinner and hate the sin, so can one render the heartiest tribute of
applause to the actor, while execrating the villain whom he has
been pourtraying; and, the stronger the audience's detestation of
the character exhibited, the greater must be the artist's merit.
Of the rest of the company I will speak presently. I wish to
consider the piece.
In order, then, to pronounce impartially upon its merits it will be
necessary to divest the play of the accidents of its production. I
must be allowed to eliminate from the whole expression inch quan-
tities as are represented by the names of MB. and MBS. BANCUOFT,
Miss FOOTE, MB. COGHLAN, MB. HARE, and all the Royal Prince of
Wales's family party; and, with them, must go the prestige of the
Theatre, and, as superadded to all this, the well-deserved popularity
of MB. WILKTE COLLINS, and the previous reputation of the novel
of Man and Wife.
What remains'? The play: and for it a clear stage and no
favour.
I suppose myself one of an ordinary audience present on the first
night of a new Drama, called Man and Wife, written by MB. NEMO
for performance at the Royal No-name Theatre by a company of
comedians unknown to fame, but equal in ability to those of the
Prince of Wales's, and playing as they played on the first represen-
tation of MB. CoLLQts's play. This entire hypothesis granted, I
criticise the drama in question.
The plot, then, of this play is weak ; the majority of the dramatis
personee uninteresting, and, on calm consideration, actually unne-
c eseary. The story can be told in a few lines, which I will suppose
spoken by Anne Silvester :—
Anne (loq). GEOFFBET wrote me a letter promising marriage, and
sent it by ABNOLD, who, when he brought it to me at the Scotch
Inn, called me his wife. GEOFFREY tried to make out that therefore
I teas ABNOLD'S wife; but I showed his letter to a Scotch Lawyer,
who decided I was not. That is all.
This is the sum of the plot, which employs Arnold, Geoffrey,
Anns, and a Scotch Lawyer. The piece could be played in two
scenes. Scene 1st Room in a Scotch Inn. Scene 2. Office of a
Scotch Lawyer. Other scenes and persons are superfluous. How-
ever, I will take them all in some sort of order.
These personages, then, whom it would be an error to style cha-
racters (one only being at all worthy of the distinction), are either
so neutrally tinted as to be almost colourless, or so obtrusively glar-
ing as to present the effect of inartistic exaggeration.
To begin with the " Spindle Side." Lady Lundie is a nonentity:
Where she goes, or how she fares,
Nobody knows and nobody cares.
Blanche Lundie is another nonentity: and, not to separate the
lovers, so is her future husband, Mr. Arnold Brinktporth. They
are a pair of very ordinary young people, in whose marriage one
feels about as much interest as in the ultimate fate of a couple of
ombres ehinoises on a piece of strained calico, with a light benind.
But, if the audience be indifferent to the happiness of these shadowy
betrothed ones, then the play has already failed in more than half
its object; for these two are the virtuous heroine and hero, whose
prosperity is endangered by the machinations of the villain.
Anne Silvester is a painful instance of a young lady whose gener-
ally excellent practice has not, in one trifling particular, been
exactly up to the high level of her generally excellent principles.
She is remorseful, but not penitent. She is sorry on account of the
inconvenient consequences; and it is difficult to suppose that she
would have had a moment's anxiety but for these consequences, as,
on no occasion, does one expression of contrition escape her. On the
contrary, apart from her MI Iky and disagreeable manner with her
friends, she avails herself of the earliest opportunity afforded by the
play, for bullying into marriage with her the man for whom, but a
short time since, she must (in order to have any excuse at all for her
conduct) have experienced a passion which was, it is to be charitably
supposed, the madness of infatuation. When he morosely hesitates,
she brings him to the point by threatening to drown herself. This
has the desired effect on Geoffrey Delamayn, who is not, it seems,
bad past hope of redemption. As this young man is not only very
young (for he is still at College, and talks about rowing in the
University eight) but also the son of a nobleman, and, as Anne
Silvester is a penniless nobody, I cannot help thinking that a jury,
composed of Society's Matrons and elderly Men of the World, would
pronounce Miss Anne Silvester a designing adventuress, and an artful
hussy; in which opinion they would be confirmed, could they notice
her bearing and overhear her words in this interview with the en-
trapped athlete, Geoffrey Delamayn. Her temper is, in its way,
equal to Geoffrey's, and when bullying is ineffective, she can cringe,
whine, and wheedle, in order to gain her purpose. This young
person has forfeited all claim to respect, and excites contempt for
her selfishness and cowardice, rather than pity for her unfortunate
condition. On my word, I would as soon weep over Becky Sharp's
humiliations, as drop a single tear over the woes of Miss Anne
Silvester.
Geoffrey is a sort of ill-conditioned, bad-mannered Rawdon
Crawley, or a superior sort of Tony Lumpkin, without those good-
hearted qualities that made Mrs. Hardcastle's son a chuckle-headed
fool, and the absence of which makes Mr. Geoffrey a loutish scoun-
drel to his friend Arnold, and an awkward liar to the woman who
had been satisfied to trust his word. That nothing can be said in
Geoffrey's praise, is not much to Anne Silvester's credit. Other-
wise, I suppose Geoffrey to have been an honourable man in his own
sporting circle, and to have been valued by friends of his own kidney
at the University; and there is not a hint to the contrary. Can an
audience feel any interest in such a couple as this P It might, were
these two placed in more thrillingly sensational situations than are
to be found in this play of Man and Wife. If compassion is to be
aroused for anyone, it must be for the unhappy Geoffrey, who is
subject to paralytic attacks, and who bears intense pain, in the Third
Act, with the pluck of a Spartan warrior, and the calmness of a
Stoic. Besides, he has saved Arnold Brinktcorth from drowning,
for which humane act the audience, at least, has small cause for
gratitude. But if there be no interest for this hero and heroine,
and it was shown that there was no interest in the other hero and
heroine, and on the fate of these four the whole interest necessarily
depends, in what personages or in what portion of the play is there
any interest whatever? If you do not care a straw for the four
persons already mentioned, you cannot care for the issue of their
misty difficulties—that is, you cannot care for the play.
To go on with the dramatis personis. Sir Patrick Lundie is a
pretentious nonentity. He says wise things, and acts foolishly. He
talks vaguely about " fighting a case," when he simply has not got
a case to fight; and alter this bravado, he contents himself with
asking a few unimportant questions, leading to nothing, and then
yields, without a blow, when told that he is acting illegally, and, in
point of fact, wasting everybody's time for his own amusement in
his own picture-gallery. His conduct helps to spin out the Act—
that is all.
Bishopriggs, the Scotch waiter, has a great deal too much to say
for what he has to do; and Mr. Speedwell, the Doctor, has a great
deal top much to do for what he has got to say. So gloomy and
saturnine a physician as Mr. Speedwell would lose, in two visits,
whatever small practice chance might have previously thrown in his

way. Were his bill for medical attendance as long aa hit face, no
one would venture to consult .him twice. Called suddenly into a
nursery, he would frighten the children out of measles into fits, and
if they survived, in spite of his attentions, he would dwell in their
memories as " Bogie from the coal-hole.
There was a French piece called L'Ange dt Minuit, wherein
every fresh appearance of L'Ange was_the certain death-warrant of
some unfortunate person among: the principals of the dramatis per-
tonee, for L'Ange refused positively to take the supernumeraries,
who, every man Jack of them, remained hale and hearty at the end
of this awful drama, and perhaps sang a Survivors' Finale. Mr.
Speedwell, H.I),, reminded me forcibly of L'Ange. A touch of
the grim playfulness of the Bottle Imp would have gone far to com-
plete his character (red tinsel being added, of course, to his eyelids,—
and what a Doctor he'd be then!), and if he had only stretched out
his demon arms, and exclaimed, hoarsely, " You must learn to love
me!" and if. as a further suggestion, at the end, instead of Geof-
frey's being left quivering on a chair, a trap had opened in the
centre of the stage, and the Demon Doctor had descended in blue
and red flames, taking with him this infamous paralytic, it would
have been a climax more in keeping with the Faust-taid.-Marguerite
sort of people represented by Geoffrey and Anne, and the Mephis-
tophelean characteristics of the diabolical Doctor Speedwell. These
be hints. Let Mr. Nameless the Author remove it from No-name
Theatre, transpontmise it, and reproduce it as a thrillingly sensa-
tional Melodrama, with fearful ghosts, terrific combats, unprece-
dented murders, and astounding explosions, entitled Man and Wife,

Nothing that MBS. BANCROFT, as Blanche Lundie, had to say was
lost, and she has to say some good things; not over many. One
of her speeches I must recall. Sir. She tells her lover that she is
quite unhappy, and adds, with all that affectionate petulance which
has lightened up so many a play at her Theatre, "Why don't you
come and comfort me?" Her tone abides on my ear, and I rejoice
to give it lodging there. She talks and acts in the First Act,
appears in the Second, talks and acts in the Third, and is behind her
pocket-handkerchief during the Fourth. I suppose she played to
strengthen the oast, and MR. BANCROFT took Dr. Speedwell for the
same reason. Otherwise MR. ARCHER, who so admirably imper-
sonated 'Deadly Smooth, in Money, would have made a very good
Doctor. MR. BANCROFT s make-up was wonderful.
MR. HARE, always a favourite as an elderly aristocrat, is growing
out of Old Men's parts. It is really time he should be put into
turn-down collars to begin with, and then into jackets.
Mu. DEWAB'S Scotch dialect was, a Scotchman told me. "just
perfect." I admitted its probable perfection, and was delighted at
its certain finish. His accent was very broad, but it suited the cha-
racter of much that he had to say. The success of the piece is the
success of the Last Act. The author, after avast amount of feinting
and dodging, fairly staggers the audience with the masterly blow of
Geoffrejft paralytic stroke, just as Geoffrey is apparently going to
do his wife a mischief, and when the audience, mindful of the novel,
expect that the whole of the latter portion of the story will be con-
centrated into one murderous action, in this last Act, to be of course
prevented by the paralysis, and perhaps by the villain's death,
Geoffrey (in spite of Speedwell's opinion) does not die, but the cur-
tain descends on the hopeful picture of Geoffrey turning lovingly,
in his helplessness, towards his wife, who, kneeling at his side,
adjures him to " come home." Hence the audience is left to infer
that, if he dies, he dies at peace with her and the world generally,
and if he lives he will acknowledge his gratitude for her attentions
by smiling on her fondly.
The Library and the Picture Gallery were two of the most perfect
"sets" ever seen, even in this Theatre.
Well, perhaps, after all, the piece will be running two years
hence. That it will certainly draw for a time, for the very reasons
which made me take my seat at the No-Name Establishment, and
that what may prove a great success at the Prince of Wales's would
have turned out but a very indifferent ^affair at any other Theatre,
are the two fixed opinions of
YOUB RUPBISKNTATIVE.

the opposition raised by their party to the Electoral Reform Bill.
The POPE has fixed next Thursday for an interview."
By this time it would be too late, if it were desirable,
to caution these pilgrims to mind what they are about.
They have had their interview with the POPE, and
obtained his blessing. Much good may it do them!
Spiritually and personally, perhaps it will. But as to the
Electoral lieforra Bill above referred to, the authors of
that proposed measure, judging from the events which
have uniformly followed the Papal benediction in the
political and mundane sphere, will perhaps be thankful
to His Holiness for having bestowed it on their adver-
saries. _.

THE UNIVERSITY BILL-IRISH JOURNALISM.
I-'KOM our ancient and amiable contemporary, the Londonderry
Sentinel, we cut the following exquisite specimen of the unconscious
waggery of our dear friends that dwell beside "the melancholy
Ocean ":—
"ERU vi I.-M.—In oar issue of the 22ad instant we announced the death of
WILLIAM SEVEN-ITAHS, Eea , of High Street, Omagh. tt~< regret to hear that the
announcement wns not aorreet. MR. S tVKN ST.VHS, who had reached a ripe old
age, waa ill at the time, and it was even reported that he was dead. The re-
port was received as true, and a correspondent, in his desire to transmit the
news without delay, instead of waiting till he would hear aomethingabout it
from the friends of MB. SEVBNSTABB, fell into the error referred to. The inti-
mation was not an unmeaning hoax; it teas simply a mistake, and we may
add that MB. SEVBNBTAEH' death has since been announced in a Belfast
paper."
Ifr. Punch is highly gratified to find his brethren in Ireland so
painfully solicitous concerning the strict accuracy of their state-
ments; and he warmly congratulates them on having " ripe " old
gentlemen like M it. SEVENSTABS, who are so extremely obliging as to
die just in time to save the credit of an imaginative Correspondent.
Metaphysics.
(For the National Irish University in Nubibus.)
IF the visible word has no real objectivity, then different people
exist only in the minds of one another; which is absurd.
QUADRUPEDS AND BIPEDS.
A COMMITTEE of Inquiry will soon discover whether there is or
not any truth in the alleged scarcity of English horses. In the mean-
while, a parallel investigation might be suggested ; but it is needless.
When we consider the ruinous striking mania which spreads from
trade to trade like a cattle plague (only that, unfortunately, it can-
not be stamped out); when we reflect upon all the rampant leagues
and associations with platform spouters at the head of them, propa-
gating enthusiasm for minding other people's business, as it were,
from herd to herd: when we try to estimate the arithmetical quan-
tity of these and all the other kinds of British "tchwdrmerei, ' we
shall see very plainly that, be the case what it may as to the suffi-
ciency or insufficiency of the number of our horses for the public
service, there is, in relation to the peace and happiness of the com-
munity, a most insufferable superabundance of asses.

RELIGION haying long since found it necessary to have nothing to
say to Trade, the latter has awakened to a sense of the duty of
taking tender care of Religion. There lies before us a delightful
circular in which an eminent firm of wine-merchants proposes to
deal with a difficulty which is supposed to exercise our clergy,
touching: the character of the wine used in church on a solemn occa-
sion. We are apprised that there is a " strong opinion" in favour
of using " unfennented " wine. This, therefore, the firm in question
offers to supply—a " tent" at 28*. and at 40«., and the character of
the house is nigh, and we doubt not that the liquid is all that it
professes to be. But—what next, and next P The text is not one
for our handling very freely, and we should prefer to leave it to
some large-minded Broad Church parson. Only, we should like to
ask the persons who hold the " strong opinion " asserted to exist,
whether they suppose that the wine used when the original cere-
monial—we purposely avoid closer contact with serious matters—
was instituted was "unf ermented," and whether they think that
the wine so often alluded in the Book now under revision in the
Jerusalem Chamber was non-intoxicating, and if so, why were
"old bottles" likely to burst, and why in the Book are good men
perpetually warned against " excess." "We fancy too that we have
heard something about "wine that maketh glad the heart of man,"
and that the rational use thereof is by no means discouraged by the
highest authority. But we live and learn, and only wifih that what
we learn conduced to wiser living.
Redintegratio Amoris.
THE objection to the new Married Women's Property Bill, that it
will substitute litigation for love between man and wife, answers
itself. That measure, if passed, will renew the terms on which the
married were related in courtship preceding marriage. Engaged
under its provisions in Nisi Print and County Courtship, wedded
partners will again become suitors and sued.

THE RETURN OF SPRING!
•earl
How late the Snowdro
Till March, in part,
The Crocus waited to appear;
It feared the Polar blast.
Chilled were the small birds' tuneful throats;
So they delayed to sing.
We, missing their accustomed notes,
Marked not approaching Spring.
The morning Sun, at last, one day,
Broke out and shone awhile;
And did, with momentary ray,
Upon a Jonrnal smile.
A sudden gleam of gladness bright
Lit up a column's head,
Its title bathing in the light
On " Spring Assizes" shed.
The gay announcement through the breast
Diffused a sudden cheer,
Because it all at once expressed
The fact that Spring was here.

[By this time Brown's right coat-tail was entirely consumed. His fuzees
had ignited by private arrangement among themselves.
Veterinary Notion.
IT seems that an outbreak of a disease amongst horses,
called the American Horsa Epidemic, is apprehended in
Prussia. In the Chamber of Deputies, at Berlin, HERB
I IONAI.IK, the other day, inquired what would be done
in that event? In replying, the Minister of Agriculture
described the horse-disease named American as a species
of influenza affecting the noble animal. What to do with
it Government would take time to consider. Considering
the reputation of a certain herb for efficacy in coughs,
together with the fact that the Horse Epidemic is an
Influenza amongst horses, the Prussian Government, and
indeed our own if need be, may be advised to try
Coltsfoot.
Firing up.
WITH coals at forty shillings a ton, some warmth of
expression on the part of heads of families may be for-
given. RUMBLE MAYBE (who never forgets his favourite
HANDEL), when he replenishes the grate, contents him-
self with adapting the words of one of the principal
characters in Acis and Galatea, saying, "I burn, I rage."
THE GREAT UNDERPAID.
AMONG those who, not included among the Striking Classes, have
the most reason to strike, may be mentioned the London Stipendiary
Magistrates. The Hon. G. C. NORTON, who for many years adorned
a Metropolitan Police Court, has demonstrated this truth in a letter
to the Times, on behalf of his sometime colleagues. The present
salaries were fixed thirty-five years ago by assessors of whom though
SIR ROBERT PEEL was one, JOSEPH HUME was another. Their
Worships, therefore, may be supposed not to have got too much
when they were awarded £1200 a-year. This sum has, ever since
the imposition of the Income-tax, remained minus that amount of
confiscation which salaried public servants are among the privileged
classes who have the honour to suffer. In the meanwhile, prices
have risen to about double what they were, through the increasing
prosperity of this great country and the progressive elevation of the
Striking Classes.
_ In return for a stipend originally out down to low figures, and
since then practically very much reduced, the London Magistrates
keep our Capital quiet for us at an expense not exceeding altogether
£20,000. They perform, each in himself, the functions of a judge
and jury in minor criminal cases. Every one of them is, in a
measure, a personal Nisi Prins Court to the lower orders; a Cadi to
the_Cads; and he works hard every day except Sundays. Whilst
their incomes, both absolutely and relatively, have been greatly
diminished in the course of years, their work has been enormously in-
creased by the numerous Acts of Parliament which have meanwhile
created so many new offences, to the great and glorious increment of
British Liberty.
The Chief Magistrate at Bow Street, to be sure, receives some-
thing extra. He has £1500 a-year. This is the salary of a County
VOL. LXTV.
Court Judge. MR. NORTON asks only the same amount each for his
former colleagues. Surely his Worship is a labourer worthy of at
least as much hire as his Honour. As to utility, indeed, we could,
perhaps, do without Police Magistrates not quite so well as with at
least ex-Lord Chancellors.
To the above observations it may be added that the _ London
Magistrates do so indifferently administer justice, in the liturgical
sense of indifference, that the heading of "Justices' Justice" to a
report of its maladministration has come in these days to be quite
limited to the provincial papers. The Justice of Justices, so called,
is always that of some of those Justices styled the "Great Unpaid."
Such justice can deserve no higher payment than what it gets,
though it may deserve some other. The Stipendiary Magistrates
may, at their present stipends, be denominated the Great Underpaid;
the measure of their greatness being that of their services. A truly
Liberal Government must see that its reputation for liberality will
depend on its adoption or disregard of MR. NORTON'S appeal for a
reasonable increase of the inadequate stipends of the serviceable, bat
scantily remunerated, Stipendiaries.
Parliament Out of All Season.
THE author of the proposal that Parliament should assemble for a
Winter Session in November did not consider how unseasonable
would be the waste of breath withinside the House of Commons in
that month when there is usually so much fog out-of-doors. Neither
could he have borne the memory of GUT FAWKES in mind; but then,
to be sure, there is no fear that a second Gur FAWKES would ad-
venture to blow up a House which, although including WHALLEY,
contains SIR GEORGE BOWYEK.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

HERE was nothing noteworthy this Monday, February 3rrf, in a dis-
cussion raised by LORD SIRATHEDEN on the question whether
Parliament should not overhaul Treaties before they are ratified,
except LORD SAiisBT/Br's declaration of the following belief :-r
"Arbitration is one of the pet nostrums of the day, like competitive exa-
mination or sewage irrigation. It will hare its day and be believed in as a
panacea, but the next generation will look back upon us with pity and con-
tempt, to think that we could have relied upon such an expedient for bridling
the ferocity of human passions."
"We hope that the next generation will have better manners. If
not, we, its revered parents, are educating it, at a vast expense, to
very little purpose. Suppose, instead, the next generation should
think of a Soldier as the embodiment and incarnation of human
passions, and should remark that somebody ought to have said to
the Marquis, as was said in presence of his namesake the Earl,—
"'What wilt thou do, renowned FAULCONBRUKJK,
Second a Villain and a Murderer?"
Not that we believe our immediate descendants will be so idiotic, but there's no saying, and we have as much right to suppose things as
LORD SALISBURY has.
MB. GLADSTONE, answering MR. GOLDSITTD, who remarked that we had paid America exactly a million too much, as the acts of the
United States testified, and that we oupht to have the balance returned, said that the business was over and we had no further concern
with it. Of course not. What's a million to a nation that has no national debt, no taxes, and more money than it knows what to do with,
like England? Or, taking the other view, let JOHN BULL resemble the Clerke in Chaucer—
"But all be that he was a Fhiloiophre,
Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre."
Certainly, Ma. MONSELL. If people will not take the small trouble of putting the right stamps on Newspapers directed abroad, destroy
them. Your Postal Guide is not all that it should be, and does not tell us the prices of foreign telegrams, but the stamp rules are very
clearly tabulated. We hate careless fools.
LOBD ENFIELD'S reason why we would not recognise the Spanish Government was exactly the same given to Tilburina by her
Governor, for not seeing the Spanish Fleet.
Then, Madam, commenced (as housemaids say, we mean began) the Great Debate upon the Irish Higher Education Bill.
Nay, speak not, dear Madam. "Answer us not but with your smile" Madam—to make Morose1 s speech more elegant. We do not
intend to trouble you with an account of every speech spoken during this mighty conflict. When you hear what MR. CITICKESTER
FORTESCUE, a Minister, and an accomplished Alcibiades (only without any vices), said about the Bill, you will judge whether it is a topic
that need be pressed upon you to your weariness. He said on Thursday—
"Ai a matter of fact, however, the class from which young Roman Catholic Ecclesiastics are drawn in Ireland, U a class which, except for the purposes
of the priesthood, is not available for the purposes of higher education at all."
There, Madam! Firstly, remarking that DR. CULLEN, according to the Minister he admires, imitates KING JEROBOAM (of evil memory
thereby), that is, makes "priests out of the lowest of the people, we, secondly, submit to you that, however desirable it may be that
MR. GLADSTONE should complete his Hibernian Triptych, the subject of the third picture is much less interesting than the skill of the
painter. Materiam superabat opus will be your Vardi—which was high-life slang for " verdict" in the days when SWIFT wrote Polite
Conversation. You know more about Verdi than Vardi? Very right too.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Well, Madam, to-night ME. GLADSTONE, without waiting for an
announced Motion, uprose, and answered, by anticipation, the speech
•which he thought was going to he made. The Bill being an Irish one,
this concession to Irish habit seemed delicate and appropriate. He
refused to give the names of the twenty-eight gentlemen whom he
meant to ask to compose the Governing Council of the University.
Pass the Bill, he said, and then we shall know what we have to request
them to do. He also mentioned a few small changes which he meant
to make in the Bill. The Motion was then made by MB. BOUBKE (a
happy man just now, for his country seat is Coalstown), and seconded
by LOBD EDMUND FITZMAUBICB (second son of LOBD LANSDOWNE),
who said he had asked, on reading the measure, "What enemy of
Ireland hath done this?" but did not mention what answer Echo
had made.
The Bourke Motion, Madam, was in the nature of an amendment
to the regular Moti9n that the Bill be read a Second Time. The
PBEMTEB'.described it as a Vote of Censure. Then we went in at it.
MR. C. E. LEWIS, the new M.I', for Londonderry, delivered a long
and able maiden speech against the Bill, and begged the House to
stick to the Mired Education which had workea so well for forty
yean. Had LORD l>vi;n.v been alive, and a Commoner, and in the
House, and rude, he might have quoted himself :—
"0 Mirth and Innocence! 0 Milk and Water!
Ye happy fixtures of more happy days!"
MB. O'MoBGAir thought the Milk and Water would not do, and
supported the Government: and the O'DONAHUE wag still more
fiery, and said that the Catholics would stand nothing but a firmly
established Catholic College, to be the fountain of education. Just
so. Who speaks of an eternal fountain of darkness perpetually
welling out obscurity? Half-a-crown for the quotation, if sent
before we go to press.
LORD ROBERT MONTAGU (a nobleman who saw the error of Pro-
testant ways, and renounced them) thought the BUI a Bungle,
though in a right direction.
MR. FAWCBTT delivered a fervid and telling oration against the
Bill, which he pounded to pieces. He was specially tremendous on
the "gagging clause," which enacts that a teacher shall be punished
if he says anything calculated to wound the religious feelings of any
member of the University. Do not look incredulous, Madam: the
words are before us, and have been well described as a mingling of
Tyranny and Twaddle.
LOBD HABTLNGTON (Irish Secretary) said the Bill had three sets
of enemies—the Senate of Dublin University, the students of the
Roman Catholic colleges, and the Romish bishops; and that none of
these represented the Irish people.
SLR MICHAEL BEACH retorted that if the Bill passed, the Govern-
ment would feel bound to stick Da. CCLLEN and his prelates into
the Council.
"So much for that, and butter for fish," as one of DEAN SWIFT'S
elegant ladies observes in the exquisite work already cited. How-
ever, we knew butter was not the next thing coming, for MB.
HOBSHAN moved the adjournment.
Tuesday.—LOBD MALMESBUBY had a good deal to say about Game
and Rabbits. He wants to show that though preservation interferes
with field produce, great compensation is obtained by the sale of the
animals. We know nothing about this, but we do know that a
rabbit smothered in onions is a dish for the Gods of Epicurus. Ah!
you agree, Madam. You have too much real gentility to mock
onions. Remember, too, that onions themselves were Gods in ancient
Egypt.
"0 happy nation here! 0 blest abodes!
When evi'ry garden is alive with gods."
Yery proper complaint in the Commons about the high postage
and slow communication between us and Italy. Letters, sixpence;
time, from four to ten days. MB. MONSELL hopes for improvement.
Then a neat little fray. MB. HENRY JAMES, in honourable and
brotherly fashion, stood up for the County Court Judges. We need
not go into detail. A very mean thing was ordained by the Treasury
about their travelling expenses, but the order was rescinded. MB.
JAMES, not having absolute confidence in Governments, demanded
whether MB. LOWE, in accepting a motion to affirm the repeal, did
so in "its spirit and intention." MB. LOWE made rather a grumpy
sort of answer, but MB. GLADSTONE fired up, and said MB. JAMES
had taken an unwarrantable liberty. Possibly, but if everybody
waited for " Justice Overdo's Warrant" btfore doing anything in
this world, a good many useful things would be left undone.
MB. PLIMSOLL then moved for the Royal Commission to inquire
into the condition of, and certain practices connected with the Com-
mercial Marine.
Simple words, but you know what they mean. He meant that,
out of 2700 persons annually drowned, four-fifths were needlessly
drowned,—and Noble Lords'and Honourable Gentlemen know why.
Be it said that as he explained himself, and indignantly dwelt upon
homicidal practices, the House of Commons cheered nim heartily.
Mr, Punch's cheer is added in his Cartoon this week.
SIR JOHN PAKINQTON seconded the Motion, and begged the
Government to concede it in the form that would be the most effec-
tive. He, too, adduced some terrible statistics.
MB. CLAY wished for a Commission that could administer oaths.
So did MR. SAMTTDA, who declared overloading, which was the
result of competition, to be the cause of most losses. Now this
gentleman knows all about the subject, and asserts that we lose,
every year, as many ships as we build.
MB. C. FORTESCUE said something about over-colouring, and exag-
geration, but conceded the Commission, and undertook, for Govern-
ment, that the inquiry, which he proposed to extend, should be
carried out.
MB. HKNTINCK distrusted Government, and advised MB. PLIMSOLL
to draw up his own order of reference.
MB. G. HAB.DT said that the charge* involved "organised man-
slaughter" (a good phrase), and wished for evidence on oath.
Finally, the Government proposal was accepted. And now, MB.
PLIMSOLL, you have a noble work before you, and Mr. Punch will
back you up against any who may seek to hinder a full investiga-
tion into the causes why so many brave fellows are annually
drowned.
Wednesday.—No discussion can be actually dull when Salmon,
either living or cooked, is the theme, and we talked a good deal
about him, and how to preserve him, and the like. Madam, there
is no fish like him. Plain boiled hath no fellow. Yet the cutlet is not
to be disdained, Madam, if your cook hath intellect. Eat him on
Sundays, Madam, without soruple (if he be fresh), for he is aJScrip-
tural lish. BOAZ was the son of SALMON. We have heard worse
reasons for many Sabbatarianisms.
Thursday.—Now, about this time, the hostility to the Irish Bill
produced many discouraging leading articles, and a general impres-
sion that it was possible He Might Not Clear It. The excellent
MB. DODSON thought he would do something in aid of the Cabinet,
and announced that he would move to refer the Bill to a Select
Committee. We were reminded [that a Cabinet, endangered on a
Reform Bill, was once saved by this device.
To-night we resumed debate, and MB. HOBSMAN had his innings.
The " Superior Person," as MB. DISRAELI called him, never did his
work in a superior manner. He went at the Bill with vehemence
and bitterness, and, having cut it to pieces, declared that it had set
the whole Liberal party "shaking in its shoes." (Whence the
§hrase, by the way? Would Da. DOBAN oblige ?) It was intro-
uced as a settlement, but the Irish prelates had blasted and
(" blast" is from the Saxon Wast) destroyed all ho_pe of that.
Moreover, the Liberal party and its leaders were not in accord on
this Bill, as they had been [on the Church and Land. Catholics
everywhere else were struggling to extricate themselves from the
fetters of the priests, and here was a Liberal Minister trying to crush
the Layman and exalt the Priest. How were the mighty fallen!
The Minister ought to withdraw the Bill. Let the House reject it,
and show that it would not permit any Government to degrade
legislation, and destroy the independence of Parliament.
MB. FOBTESCUE had hard work after this fiery onslaught, especi-
ally as the Members had mostly gone away to dinner, but he really
managed to say a good deal in an adroit manner.
After several speeches, UK. PLAYFAIB came up, and, as an Acade-
mical man, he deplored the exclusion of Philosophy and History, a
course that would make the University the laughing-stock of
Europe. The Bill was virtually a concession to the Priests, though
not all they wanted.
The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQTTEB intimated that the " gagging
clause " might be given up, whereat the House broke into cheers.
He never knew a scheme, meant to produce peace and good-will, so
unkindly treated. MB. LOWE is a capital debater, but he was cer-
tainly not in good form to-night, and hardly hurt anybody.
MB. G. HARDY wanted MB. GLADSTONE to say what were the
exact points on which he should be obliged to stake his political
existence. (This, Madam, the PREMIER had hinted at in a speech
at a dinner to MB. LOCKE KIM;.) Mr. Punch was reminded of a
famous cut of his, in other days, where a swell-bagman asks a
waiter, "Now, what is the very smallest sum I can give you without
being considered mean P" He defied Government to the fight.
MR. VEBNON HABCOUBT moved the adjournment, and he had four
days to prepare himself, as the debate was adjourned till the Mon-
day night.
Friday.—Hooray, Madam, we have a war at last! The KING OF
THE ASHANTEES (who they may be is a mere detail) has crossed our
frontier with 12,000 men. We are going to fight him. It "s refresh-
ing to have pleasant news after all our sordid bother about Strikes,
Irish Priests, and Coals.
The Commons had a long night, but a dull one, and there was
nearly a Count Out on an Indian question. The river Shannon was
much censured for overflowing, but MB. LOWE declined to impose
Saxon fetters on a free, noble, and affectionate Irish river.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
Visits the Court and Old Astley's, and thereupon addresses the'
Editor at usual.
'OBTHTSir, I represented
Yon at the now well
known Court Theatre,
before the LORD CHAM-
BKRLAIN'S order had
been issued. I visited
it because I had heard
that there was being
performed a witty poli-
tical satire, entitled
The nappy Land. I
saw it. Well, it cer-
tainly did deal with
political subjects. So
had I seen the Clown
at Christmas-time deal
with similar' 'questions
of the day " before he
was warned oil' the
ground. For its wit,
there were three or
f our "points "as tell-
ing with the public as
are the very easily
made hits in a street-
ginger's ballad, or the
popular "topical"song
which delights music-
hall politicians." In the make-up of three actors as caricatures of
M it. Ui. MISTONE, MB. Lows, and MB. ATBTON, lay'tke main attrac-
tion of the piece. -The make-up of the second was as good as was
MB. PAULTON'S at the Strand, where he made the success of a dull
burlesque by appearing as BISMARCK, with a song and dance. The
abstract idea of these three doing a similar sort of thing, is certainly
preposterously absurd. Haying laughed at the three or four
tl palpable hits," of which the objects were quite fair game, it
occurred to me that ten minutes of this was enough. The satire was
of the sledge-hammer order, and the slain were slewn over and over
again, to weariness. For a short time the First Act was lively; the
Secend Act was the faint shadow of the first.
The Happy Land was evidently considered too dangerous a pre-
cedent to be permitted. Where would this sort of thing stop?
What had been commenced in the West, would soon be dangerously
improved upon in the East. For it must be remembered, that, on
the English stage of the present day, it is only_ the heaviest hand
that does the satirical work most effectually. Aristophanes, without
a pinch of Attic salt, with a drayman's cart-whip in one hand, and
a bludgeon in the other, must be the ideal of a modern satirist who
achieves popularity on the theatrical platform, at a time .when
vulgarity and rudeness often do duty for witty repartee.
Requiring, after such an entertainment, something exhilarating,
Tour Representative decided upon visiting SANGEB'S Amphitheatre,
"late"-alasI late—" Asiwrs." The attraction was a "Grand
Historical Spectacular Drama, in four Acts, called Fair Rosamond;
or, the Days of the Plantagenet." Sir, my venture was repaid with
interest. There were Grandeur, History, and Spectacle from the
front door to the back of the stage. Your Representative had not
visited Astley's for some considerable time, and was dazzled, not to
say struck and taken back, by all that met his astonished and
delighted gaze on the very first moment of his arrival at the Grand
National Entrance. Statuesque horses in white and gold were on
the staircase, where classic figures, in graceful and enthusiastic atti-
tudes, beckoned the visitor to the Private Boxes, and the Balcony
Dress Stalls. A courteous gentleman in a resplendent livery, which
was a compromise between that of a Beadle and a Park-keeper,
received us (a friend from the country, and myself) under the por-
tico, and waved us onward in an upstair direction, as though he
were cheering us to perseverance with the cry of "Excelsior .'
Excelsior!" The Equestrian performances were going on, and
1 gave myself up to the thorough enjoyment of a " Grand Nautical
Act, by EKNEST," called " The Sailor, or the Perils of the Deep."
Perils! I should think so. There was the British Tar, standing on
a horse's back and careering round and round with a peculiar
motion, which must have strongly reminded him of his native
element. Then arose a dreadful storm of thunder and lightning,
which made us tremble for that poor sapor's safety on board that
gallant steed. The blinding flashes were ingeniously represented by
lowering the gas sharply, and as sharply turning it on again; a de-
vice which really had a most terrifying effect, even without the
assistance of the Drum, which evidently could not resist the oppor-
tunity afforded by the darkness of coming out uncommonly strong
as the thunder.
It was a night of terror for that child of the Ocean, and I would
not have answered for the consequences to the Management had the
brave MB. PLIMSOLL been present. In strained anxiety Your
Representative watched the actions of this lonely Horse-marine. The
ship had evidently struck; I could tell by his action that she was
fast sinking (the horse did not enter at all into the spirit of the
entertainment, but kept up its even canter, once or twice casting its
eye back, with, I fancied, a slight touch of superciliousness in its
look), and then I saw that the moment had arrived when there was
nothing left but to swim for it. Off went the Horse-marine's hat, off
went his tie, and then, discarding so much clothing as the occasion
seemed to permit, he struck out boldly on that unsympathetic animal's
back, and presently reached shore, represented by a spot within three
inches of the crupper. Here he piously knelt down, and expressed
in pantomime his gratitude to Providence. It was very good indeed,
and would have been absolutely sublime, but that my eye unfortu-
nately fell upon the Clown, who, in the centre of the ring, was
positively ridiculing the sailor's distress, pretending to shed tears,
and scoffing at this honest Tar's outburst of devotion. "What
place," I cried indignantly, "has a Clown in a shipwreck? Would
he behave as has this excellent mariner; or, on his first finding him-
self safe on land, would he merely grin, cut a caper, say ' Here we
are again! how are yon to-morrow?' and sin? Hot Codlins f"
At last, at about eight o'clock, the curtain rose upon the first
scene of Fair Rosamond; or, the Days of the Plantagenet.
Briefly, this Spectacle is exceedingly well put upon the stage, or,
as one ought to say. when speaking of an Equestrian Drama, it is
"admirably mounted."
The A ut hor and Stage Manager have done their work boldly and
thoroughly. The villain is an equestrian villain—none of your
infantry scoundrels, but on horseback, with vindictive "asides";
and it is not such an easy matter, let me tell you, judging from this
instance, to depict the partially-suppressed passions of envy, hatred,
malice, and all unchantableness, and to deliver such cynical asides
as fell to the lot of Bertrand de Born, the wicked troubadour, even
when seated on the quietest cream-coloured steed that ever sniffed
sawdust. Thomas a Beckett was invariably a-foot. It is evident,
from this piece, that at an early stage of his career, the future
Primate developed the clearest proofs of his subsequent ecclesiastical
vocation, by exhibiting on all occasions a strong desire to seize
the slightest opportunity for addressing anybody, on any subject,
in a style suggestive of "heads for future sermons." His delivery
was that of a man who thought a good deal while speaking. I think
it was Thomas a Beckett—but perhaps it wasn't—who asked some-
body, as he entered, attended by a friend, "Are you afraid to come
alone P Or do you bring him (the friend) here as your icet-nurse?"
The quotation is not verbatim, except thfr last word. But why a
doughty old English Baron or a Squire, or Knight of the Shire,
should go about with a wet-nurse, was a considerable puzzle to me
until my intelligent friend pointed out to me that _ wet-nurse"
was the actor's peculiar pronunciation of the word "witness."
I have no time to give in detail how King Henry was crowned in
Westminster Abbey, where on horseback came the mounted Cham-
pion of England, where Theobald, predecessor of A Beckett in the
See of Canterbury, kept handing up sceptres and crowns to the King
and Queen, and hurrying down the steps of the throne again as if he
were afraid of a kick from the impetuous monarch; or how the
Castle of Bridgenorth was stormed, how Clifford died, how he was
carried about the battle-field on a stretcher; how the May-Day
sports, were of rather a lugubrious and monotonous character, but
quite in keeping with our national reputation for dolef ulness and want
of a musical ear; how the Monks came to fetch Thomas a Beckett
to evening service in his own Cathedral, whither he didn't appear a
bit inclined to accompany them, and, indeed, was not even prevailed
on to do so by their telling him that " the congregation was calling
for him"—most indecent conduct by the way; how, finally. Queen
Eleanor did neither poison nor stab Rosamond, but insisted on her
retiring, like Ophelia, to a [nunnery; how Thomas a Beckett, in
the middle of a highly ornate service, belonging to no particular
Church or sect, but perhaps a little fancy of his own, was
assassinated, and the King arrived too late to save him, but soon
enough to punish the over-zealous knights. I say I have not time nor
space for all this in detail, suffice it that Fair Rosamond is the only
thing of the sort in London, and that it most satisfactorily revives
the ancient equestrian glories; and, were the " dialect" only cut
a bit, so that we might get sooner to the '"osses," the piece would
be much benefited thereby, and not in vain would this suggestion
have been made by yOUK REPBESENTATIVE.
Seasonable Belief.
To one class, at least, the present state of the Coal Market brings
hope, if not immediate comfort. These are the unfortunate persons
who have all their lives been accustomed to be "hauled over the
coals." There will soon be no coals for them to be hauled over.

A CHILD'S DOOM.
WE usually abstain from the discussion of merely painful things.
Those who desire such reading find it amply supplied elsewhere, and
some of our respected contemporaries serve it up strongly flavoured
enough for any appetite. But here is a case in which we make ex-
ception. We take this paragraph from the Pall Mall Gazette .—
"Chimney-sweeps, who continue, in defiance of the law, to employ' climb-
ing boys' may take warning from a case which has been tried at Durham. A
Gnteihead chimney-sweeper was sentenced to eiv months' imprisonment for
the manslaughter of an unhappy little lad who was suffocated in attempting
to carry out his orders in clearing a flue."
Apart from the individual ruffianism in this case, Sir. Punch
asks whether the Act which was intended to deliver little children
from the most hideous cruelties, is becoming a dead letter in any
part of the kingdom. Is there any other place than Gateshead
where little lads are rammed into foul flues to be suffocated? The
present generation may not remember the struggle that had to be
tought out, over and over, before the children could be protected.
It had to be waged against habit, prejudice, greed, ridicule; but
the victory was won. JAKES MOHTGOMERY, the poet, with one
ghastly but damaging volume, the Chimney Sweep's Magazine and
Climbing Soy's Album, gave thousands a nightmare that lasted for
years, but he carried the Act. There was a poem in the book, too,
by BLAKE, the painter, that did yeoman's service. We got the
Act, and believed that the system of atrocious cruelty was at an
end. But the above paragraph wakes painful doubts. Will some
M.F. set an investigation going P
We should call the sentence on the fellow who killed the child
ridiculously mild, could anything ridiculous connect itself with such
a theme. We wish that this master chimney-sweeper of Gateshead
could have been sentenced to two years' imprisonment, varied by
twenty sound lashes with the cat every quarter day, except the last,
when he should have had fifty, as a parting testimonial of the public
sense of his character. Let us hope that the gaolers of Gateshead
are not of a forbearing kind, and that the excellent chaplain will
give him terrifying Calvinistio doses of rommination, calculated to
* chasten him in the night season," since he will not get the other
castigation he has so well earned.
SMALL TALK.
Wu EX you dine out, as there is no Opera to discuss yet, and the
Exhibition of New Masters will not be open for some time to come,
and nobody's trial or case is at present harassing everybody, and the
Transit of Venus is out of the sphere of most people, and the Great
Wall opposite Hampton Court Gardens is stopped, and the Univer-
sity Boat Race is not near enough to be a sufficiently stimulating
topic, you may have to fall back on the Central Asian question. If
so, you can have no difficulty in earning for yourself the reputation
of being an authority on the subject, if you will only say, with an
adequate air of importance and mystery, that you know—the state-
ment is easily learned off by heart beforehand—that " last summer,
Badakhshan, believing itself menaced by the Afghans, concluded an
offensive and defensive treaty with the Padishah of Chitral, on the
southern side of the Himalayas, and also asked the help of YAKOOB
BEG, of Kashgar."
Dp not be deterred from volunteering this information by any
foolish fear of being interrogated on the details. Your fellow-
guests will, in all probability, be equally ignorant with yourself of
the geographical bearings of Badakhshan and Chitral, and of the
very existence of such a being as the Padishah, but they will
assume a well-informed look, and not betray their secret. It is not
everybody who knows where the Himalayas are.

IN a recent action for a breach of promise of marriage,

able to obtain the consent of his family—to wit, three of
his eldest daughters, and of four of the brothers and
sisters of his deceased wife, and of the defendant's aunt—
to his marriage with the plaintiff." The sequel will not
surprise any one. The defendant was unable to obtain
the consent of his eight relatives, daughters, and brothers-
in-law, and sisters-in-law, and aunt. As there is no
mention made of such an influential connection, it is to
be presumed that the defendant did not possess a mother-
in-law—her presence in the family council would, pro-
bably, have had the effect' of deterring him from even
making the attempt to induce its members to allow him
to enter into a second matrimonial engagement.

A STEP IN THE PEERAGE.
"!N great attempts 'tis glorious e'en to fail; " therefore the failure
of LORD FITZ-WALTER to reconcile the Lords to the gigantic scheme
of the Chelsea "Waterworks Company, for disfiguring the Thames,
should be duly glorified. Of Suffolk, in Henry the Sixth, a spirit
evoked from below predicts that :—
"By water shall he die and take his end."
The oracle is borne out in Suffolk's death at the hands of one
Walter Whitmore, whose Christian name, in the vernacular of the
period, seems to have been pronounced Water, although, as Suffolk
vainly reasons with him:—
"Thy name ii Gualtier, being rightly sounded."
It would accordingly be calling LORD 'Fm-W ALTER somewhat
out of his name simply to pronounce it for the time to come Frrz-
WATER; but perhaps the Chelsea Water Company may have influ-
ence with the Government enough to procure for the noble Lord a
step in the Peerage, namely an Earldom, by the augmented and
appropriate title of LORD WATERWORKS.

INVALUABLE. OBTUSENESS.
THE Times, in a leader, adverting to the iucautionsness of certain
classes, employed as well as employers, truly observes that:—
"There i> something in dangerous occupationi which seems to blunt the
sensitiveness, if not to harden the hearts of those engaged in them, toward*
the apprehension of peril. It ii * temptation which affects all classes. The
miner IB as reckless in lighting his pipe in a fiery mine as a mine-owner may
be reckless in neglecting to improve the ventilation."
Very true; and in the nature of things, apparently, this contempt
for danger, bred by familiarity with it. is fortunate for Society.
That is, if War be a necessary outcome of the nature of things. Or
else what should we do for soldiers; at any rate, what would sol-
diers do for us P What sort of fighting would be done for other
nations whose soldiers are not volunteers, do not enlist, but serve
under compulsion f How would any army, not callous to jeopardy
of life and limb, behave under fire? Recklessness of danger, con-
stitutional or acquired, may be partial idiocy; but it is the courage
of the common mind. Let us praise it, therefore, Gentlemen and
Ladies, let us honour it exceedingly.

by MB. VKKNON HARCOTIRT, who did his best in answer to Mit. HORSMAN,
and who contended that it was not the first duty of Ministers to please the
Irish prelates, but to make a fair Bill, and let the prelates do as they pleased.
He did not think the Bill perfect, but it might be mended in Committee.
The " gagging clause" was a hideous deformity. He and his friends would not
desert a Minister who had done so much good. Da. BAIL delivered a very
able and impassioned invective against the Bill, which, if carried, would have
been carried by the Welsh and Scotch. The House was BO pleased at his per-
formance, that hands were actually clapped. It was very good clapper-clawing,
as SHAKSI'EAKK would have said.
Divers—we don't mean pearl-fishers, at least they brought up very few pearls
of oratory—followed. MB. M i -M.I, said that Parliament had sown the wind,
and was now reaping the whirlwind. LORD JOHN MANNERS informed MR.
GLADSTONE that his genius was essentially destructive. MR. BERNAL OSBORNB
said that the PREMIER, like Falstaff, had led his ragamuffins where they had
been peppered. The Silent Sister was to be made both blind and deaf. Every-
thing Irish was exaggerated—a shanty was called an hotel, and a hedge-school
a college. Let the Irish Colleges be called Schools, and reformed accordingly.
It had been imploringly said, "Date obolum Selisario "—give a vote to a poor
blind Government; but he was really afraid to do so. He begged MR. GLAD-
STONE to withdraw the Bill.
MR. CABDWELL urged that no Member voting for the Second Heading was
thereby committed to details. (Here people went away a good deal.) He
intimated the willingness of Government to surrender many points. Then
there was rather a demand that the debate should be closed, and MB. MITCHELL
HENRY waxed wroth, and hearing certain noises made at his remarks, declared
that he heard "the sounds of Balaam." This shows that the Honourable
Member would have been the better for a little reading of the Book which the
prieste naturally dislike laymen to study. We adjourned, after a few words
from the PBEMIBB.
—This was the Great Night Entirely, Madam,
"Big with the fate of GLADSTONE and
Good COLONEL WILSON-PATTEN began, and heartily op-
posed the Bill, which would enable the " fulminating"
priests to destroy the independence of education. MB.
O'REILLY supported it, and quoted those eminent poets,
TDK MOOBE and VIRGIL, the second happily, for he
cited the elegant passage in the Georgics where the
effect of grafting is described, and he pictured Trinity
College as admiring her new foliage, et nnn sita poma.
Apples of Discord, however, seem the chief Irish pro-
duction in that line. MB. BOFVEBIE (old Whig) said
that the Bill was miserably and scandalously bad,
also that it had already " gone to Hades," whereat several
"self-made men" probably asked their neighbours what
Ady's meant. 8m P. O'BBIEN said that the Irish
Catholics only asked for justice, and that this Bill was
an insult.
Then, Madam, it wag felt that the time had oome for
the great Swrorders to combat. Breath was bated—we
don't mean the Irish word—as-
"With hand whose almost careless coolness spoke
Its grasp well used to deal the sabre-stroke,
With eye, though calm, determined not to spare,
I)id LARA too his willing weapon bare."
MB. DISRAELI stood at the table. He was in his best
form, Madam, as your daughters say. and should not.
He was like his own Aboriginal Inhabitant, in that
capital book Popanilla, and he came to give everybody a
sound flogging all round. But he did it in the most
artistic fashion. One for MR. HABCOURT, who had talked
like an " Attorney-General"—and this went home, and
the House began to cheer. One for MB. CABDWELL, who
had explained away the Bill, and one for MB. GLAD-
STONE, who had explained away the explanation. We
might discuss the Bill in Committee. Of course we
might—how gracious; what else do we go into Com-
mittee for? Then we had some good fun about the
granting decrees, and he told a story about his refusing
to do something to please some White Quakers, for fear
lest they should confer the degree of White Quaker on
him. (There were some more white Quakers in the
House just then.) Then he derided Government for
refusing to found a Philosophy chair in an age "when
young men prattle about protoplasm, and young ladies
in gilded saloons unconsciously talk atheism." (Tell
your daughters that, dear Madam.) He was very
effective on this part of the subject. Then he adverted
to concurrent endowment. That was the policy of
statesmen. It had been PEEL'S, and PALJLEBSTON'S, and
once MB. GLADSTONE'S own, but he had abandoned it for
a policy of confiscation. That policy had led to the
Disestablishment of the English Church in Ireland, but
what had followed? The Disestablishment of the Catholic
Church in Rome, and for this the Papacy was indebted
to CABDINAL CULLEN, whom let Protestants therefore
reverence. "You," he said to the Government—
"Have had four years of it; you have despoiled Churches,
you have threatened every corporation and endowment in the
country—(laughter and cheert)—you have examined into every-
body's affairs—(cheers]—you have criticised every profession,
and vexed every trade—(renewed laughter and cheers). Nobody
is certain in property; no one knows what duties he will have
to perform to-morrow—(e/ueri). This is the Policy of Con-
fiscation."
He concluded by declaring that he must vote against a
Bill which was monstrous in its general conception, per-
nicious in many of its details, and utterly futile as a
measure of practical legislation.
There is only one man in the House who can hold his
own against such sword-play as that, but the man was
there—" a strong man armed "—we may add, "keeping
the House."
MB. GLADSTONE taunted his antagonist with having
talked for halt -mi-hour on matters that had nothing to
do with the subject. Concurrent endowment I It was
dead, no doubt, but it might revive under the potent
charm of the Magician opposite. But PEEL was not its
friend, nor had he himself ever been. Then the 1' it KM n ,u
defended himself for having made this Bill a question of
confidence. This was needful, after three years of re-
sistance to what was part of a general scheme for the wel-
fare of Ireland. He denied complicity with the Catholic
prelates. Supporting the principles of the measure, he
was bitterly sarcastic on the "Waiters on Providence"
who had so eulogised the Bill at first, but had now all
run away from Us promoters. He called on the House

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TEMPORA MUTANTURI
Ancient Iteasman (to his Officer just returned to Barracks). "COFFEE AND
CURA^OA, SIR ?—BRANDT AND SODA?"
Modern Captain. "AuoH.1—No. BEING ME A GLASS OP ICED TOAST-AND-
WAT-AR III"
AWFUL ANNOUNCEMENT.
AT the top of the Times Police Reports, on Friday,
last week, appeared a cage which may be described as
both shocking and astounding:—
"At MARYLEBONE, SIR JOHN DUKI COLERIDGE was snm-
inoned by MR. BET AN, on behalf of the Metropolitan Board of
Works, for having a chimney on fire at his residence, 1, Sussex
Square, Hyde Park. MR. MANSFIELD inflicted a fine of 10s. and
01. rosts."
The announcement that the ATTORNEY-GENERAL (for
MR. GLADSTONE was as yet Premier) had been summoned
before a Magistrate and fined, could not but have
shocked every the least sensitive nature in a degree only
less than the mind would have experienced from the
news that the LORD CHANCELLOR or the ARCHBISHOP
OF CANTERBURY had been "had up." Equally astound-
ing also was the intelligence that the offence charged
against SIR JOHN DUKE COLERIDGE was that of having
had a chimney on fire; as the right honourable and
learned gentleman is known to be a sweeping reformer.
THE CASE OF THE COAL RING.
IT is a matter of statistics that the death-rate rose
very highly during the late oold weather. This increase
of mortality was evidently in a great measure due to the
coal famine. Happily for the thriving Coal-owners, this
is a consideration which Political Economy not only
permits, bnt enjoins them not to pay the slightest at-
tention to. Political Economy alone controls legislation;
Christianity is an affair of conscience. The Coal-owners
have quite as much right to make money irrespectively
of the death-rate as the men, who, the other day, refused
to try and rescue a drowning child, had to decline risk-
ing their persons; and therefore consistency requires
us to point out the absurdity of prefixing to paragraphs
describing the conduct of these latter in that respect
such headings as "Almost Incredible" and "Shocking
Inhumanity."
APPEAL TO TUK UNITED STATES.
You do sing " Hail, Columbia!" as well as " Yankee
Doodle;" but still your Continent has derived its name
from AMERIGO VESPUCCI. Now, AMERIGO is only the
Christian name of that voyager. Couldn't you sometimes
call your great and glorious country YESPUTIA P
to let the Bill go into Committee, and then to improve it as much as
possible. And he said :—
"My hon. and learned friend the Member for Oxford, in Inn eloquent
speech the other day, said he had years of political life before him. I have
very little before me, but I have much bebind me. I have an account to
render. I have a past and present to think of. The duties of the moment
are solemn, and I wish to leave upon record the solemn conviction I entertain
that it would be a grave and serious error on the part of this House were they
to give the slightest encouragement to the demand that is made for introducing
into Ireland the system of separate endowment for separate religious institu-
tions or academical purposes.
After some humorous references to other speakers, especially
"that old but repentant rebel," Ma. BKNTINCK, M it. GLADSTONE
said that he was not afraid of the charge that he wished to serve the
priests. He was ready to serve them, or any other men, as far as
justice demanded, but was not ready to go an inch further for them
or any other men. His peroration was fine:—
"To mete out justice to Ireland according to the best of our views, and to
which with our human infirmities we could attain, has been the work—I will
almott say the sacred work—of this Parliament (cheers and count er-chetrs).
Having put our hand to the plough let us not turn back. Let not what we
think the folly and perverseness of those whom we are attempting to benefit
have the slightest effect in turning us from the path we have undertaken to
tread. As we have begun, so let us go through; with a firm and resolute
hand let us efface from the laws and practice of the country the last—for I
believe it is the last—of the religious and social grievances of Ireland
(loudcheeri)."
Then the House divided (about two on Wednesday morning), and
the numbers were :—
For the Government
Against
284
287
Majority against Government . . 3
The result was known before the proclamation was made, for
COLONEL TAYLOR, the Conservative Whip, was unable to conceal
his triumph. He waved the paper, and the roof rang with the cheers
of the victors.
Ma. GLADSTONE said the vote was of a grave character, and he
moved the adjournment of the House until Thursday. So died the
Irish Higher Education Bill.
Thursday.—Announcement was made, in both Houses, that
Ministers had resigned.
It was known that HER MAJESTY, faithful as always to constitu-
tional traditions, had " sent for" MR. DISRAELI.
Both Houses adjourned until the Monday.
But the Commons did not separate until MR. OSBORNE had tried
to extract some more information from those who, he said, had run
the ship aground, and to whom MR. GLADSTONE, with admirable
gravity, replied that he had given a complete narrative of events so
far, and anything else belonged to a new chapter. MR. GILPIN
suggested what the Times called the "puerile" device of a vote to
the effect that the rejection of the Bill did not mean want of confi-
dence, but he found no favour. Keep to the old lines, Gentlemen,
vou will not mend them. MR. GLADSTONE was simply doing an
English statesman's duty in resigning after a hostile vote on a large
question. We do not want our system improved. Finally, MR.
DiLLWYN tried to press his Salmon Bill, and the House roared. We
see nothing to laugh at. Irish Salmon do repay any pains taken to
improve them.
Nor did the Lords separate until they had done something.
Earlier in the week they read the important Judicature Bill a
Second Time, thus paying a tribute to the genius of the new LORD
CHANCELLOR, who seems likely to succeed where so many have
failed. And this evening they debated the Marriage with a Wife's
Sister Bill, and once more rejected it, this time by 74 to 49, majority
25. You may like to know, Madam, that the PRINCE OK WALES and
the DCKK OF EDINBURGH paired in favour of the Bill, the former
with his brother-in-law's father, the DUKE OF ARGYLL, who opposed
it. Our uncle, the DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE, paired for its rejection.

IRISH JURIES-PRUDENCE.

r
A MONUS! other novelties in Ireland they
have a new Jury system, but it does not
seem to be a success. The account (riven
by the Dublin Correspondent of the Times
of some incidents at the last Irish Assizes
is as droll as a farce and as strange as a
fiction, and should be examined by any-
body who wants a little relaxation after
studying the Irish Education Bill. We
feel we are contributing to "the gaiety of
nations" by reproducing the best of these
Juryana.
County Gal way shall lead the way :—
"In one of the late prosecutions connected
with the Galway election, the Juror who should have acted as foreman begged to be excused,
and made way for another."
Modesty or bashfulness, perhaps, was the cause' of this Irishman shrinking
from the honour proposed to be thrust upon him? Read on:—
"It was afterwards found that he had good reason for declining the position, being
wholly illiterate. In a criminal trial at the Commission Court a similar incident occurred,
the Juror in that case avowing his inability to read or write."
An Education Bill is clearly wanted in Gal way, but such studies as reading
and writing, although they may seem dangerous accomplishments in the eyes
of Roman Catholic prelates, and fraught with peril to the Faith, must not be
excluded from it. Nenagh, too, appears to be in want of a little elementary
instruction, for the same illiteracy came to light there as at Qalway.
Next let us see what happened at Mullingar. There
"the Court was disturbed by a little wretched-looking old man, who hobbled to the
table, and insisted on speaking to < his Worship.' When he obtained a hearing, he stated
tliat he could not «tand it any longer; that he had only two-pennyworth of bread on the
previous day, and had to come a long distance. The Chief Bi
him from further attendance as a Juror."
Baron immediately released
Further mention is made of a second and third poor Juryman being
released from serving, and there were probably others in waiting with pleai
equally cogent, if they could only have gained a hearing.
"At Trim, a special jury was sworn to try an ejectment case, in which possession ol
170 acres of land was sought. When the issue paper was handed to the Chief Baron he saw
that it was unintelligible, and handed it back to be properly filled, proposing to dictate the
words in which the finding should be given. The foreman proceeded to write, but he hac
recourse to the Registrar to assist him in spelling such words as 'lands' and 'mentioned.'
Finally, to save time, the Registrar dictated the letters, while the Judge dictated the
syllables, and the issue paper was filled. After all it was discovered that the word
'plaintiff' was ipelt with a 'b,' and his Li
amended."
Lordship had to send the paper back to have il
After reading this lesson in dictation and its issue, who will not fervently
hope that he may never have the ill-luck to be a party in an ejectment case a
Trim— at least, until its special jurors have mastered the orthography of such
ntricate words as "lands" and "mentioned," and
liscovered that there is no "b " in plaintiff. We do not
orget that GEORGE THE SECOND confused his "b's"
,nd "p's," or that 3fr. Weller, senior, experienced a
liffioulty in discriminating between " v " ana " w."
"At Monaghan, Mu. KANE, J. P., a grand juror, who was
also summoned as a petty juror, asked Ma. JUSTICE KEOOH
whether he was obliged to serve in the latter capacity. His
vordship replied that the Jury Act had only recently come into
iperation, and its results had not been fully developed. He
lid not know whether Ma. KANK would be enabled by any of
ts peculiar provisions to be in two places at the same time."
MR. JUSTICE EEOOH is evidently as distinguished for
mmour as for courage. No mention is made of SIR
IOVLK ROCHE and his historic bird, but there can be no
doubt they would both be cited.
"Shortly afterward*, when a petty jury came to be em-
>anelledj one of the jurors was sworn as DAVID GBDDKS, and
he Registrar insisted that he answered to that name, but he
nformed the Court that his real name was KICUAKU JACK,
and he was re-sworn in that name."
Every man is the best judge of what his own name is,
and JACK, alias GEDDES, has our sympathy in this contest
irith the Registrar. We should prefer GBDDKS lo JACK,
nit are not in love with either appellative.
"In reply to questions the jurors stated that they had never
served before, and would not then, if they could help it. One
of them appealed to the Judge to let him off on the ground that
le had a bad leg, and could not sit in the box. He offered to let
iia Lordship see the leg. MB. JUSTICE EBOOH declined the
privilege, and told him to stand aside, fle replied he oould not
stand."
This juryman was evidently a wag. and deserved
lis freedom. MR. JUSTICE K BOSH'S refusal to see the
eg will be approved of by all his judicial brethren. The
nspection of such a limb of the law might have set on
foot a disagreeable precedent.
Just one more scene.
"At Clonmel, during the trial of a man charged with murder,
Counsel for the Crown, when replying at the close of the case,
was frequently interrupted by a juryman, whose condition at-
tracted the notice of the Court. A doctor was sent to examine
aim, and swore that he was under the influence of drink, and
would require several hours' repose. The jury were then con-
ducted through the Court, amid the laughter of the bystanders,
to wait until the juror should become sober. It was afterwards
found that he was seriously ill, being in a semi-comatose con-
dition, and they had to be discharged."
We thought we should perceive the aroma of whiskey
before we had done. After reading this last story, no
one will be surprised to hear that "the Chief Justice
commented upon the fact as illustrating the unsatisfac-
tory character of the Jury Act." MR. EHSKINE NICOL, or
some other skilful delineator of Irish character, ought
to seize upon the incident of the exit of the jury to
await the return of sobriety to one of their fellows, and
transfer it to canvas.
It is not improbable that we may have a new jury
system in England. We will hope tor more favourable
results than those so graphically depicted by the Times'
Correspondent in Ireland.
Confess Thyself!
AKOTHER fool, exemplifying a very common form of
insanity, has been giving himself up and confessing
that he committed the Eltham murder. Which is the
greater fool, this kind of one, or the other who allows
himself to be led by the nose to such a length as to be
induced by a sham practitioner of priestoraft to practise
auricular confession in a parson's ear?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
lie visits a Fair, and reports himself to the Editor, as usual.
HEN, Sir, I have nothing better
to do—a rare occasion, as You
may imagine — Your Repre-
sentative likes to take a holi-
day. On such an occasion I
am fond of representing my-
self as sauntering among the
theatrical booths of this vast
Metropolitan Fair, amusing
myself by examining their
flaming pictures hung outside,
listening to the screams of
"Walk up! "Walk up! "from
the hoarse throats of the oppo-
sition showmen, and debating
with myself the question as
to which exhibition shall be
benefited by my patronage.
This entertainment costs me
no more than threepence for
the Times, and, I regret to say,
the price of the coals in my
grate. I do not tramp the
streets to obtain my informa-
tion. The Fair is here.
The advertisement sheet,
with its sole piece of furni-
ture, the old clock in the
corner— tHat small pale-faced
dial, with its unchangeable
hands fixed at half-past twelve
punctually, whether A.M. or
i'.M. is a matter of choice to
the gazer, far more famous
than its reverend friend at St. Paul's, or its towering relation at
St. Stephen's, which is never the same for two minutes together,
—this advertisement sheet of the Times is for me the common
whereon the circus-tents and booths are pitched, and the caravans
of performing prodigies display their banners, lower their platforms,
and let down their steps to the public.
I have been right through the fair. The clanging, the trumpeting,
and the shouting have made my head whizzy, and I sit down within
hearing of its murmur (it is difficult to get entirely away from
that), unwilling to " turn again," even though, like WHITTINGTON,
I should be bidden to the Mansion House by the chimes of Bow
Bells. If I return to the busjr scene, which booth shall I enter?
There used to appear at one time, daily, perhaps it does now, an
advertisement headed, "Where shall we go to-day?" and the
answer ingenuously gave the name of the advertiser's exhi-
bition, without the slightest hesitation, and without a hint of the
possibility of visiting any other amusement in the Metropolis. It
was as great a boon to waverers as is the fixed menu of a one
o'clock ordinary. The Legislature might appoint certain days
for certain shows, and this would assist some folks over a difficulty.
But everything is open to me at once—all are beckoning, inviting,
and prying the excellence of their wares aloud in my ears, frantic
as might be a gang of lunatic Cheap-jacks broke loose from Bedlam.
I stagger, and retire with my pockets buttoned, dazed, amazed,
confused by the jarring din. Only a very few managements seem
to me to display their wares respectably and soberly; and they
have certainly been no losers by the method. One of these has, if I
am not mistaken, invariably preserved a modest and almost bash-
fully-advertising demeanour, as though it were forced, blushingly,
to announce its own merit, at the same time that, for its friends'
sake, it regretted the smallness of its house, and the unfashionable
neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road. Yet if I want to mention
a really successful Theatre. I name, from first to last, MRS.
BANCROFT'S, or, as she still allows "her friends in front" to call her,
M uu K WILTON—and more power to her pretty elbow. There are
one or two others—as, for example, the Gaiety, where the stock in
trade, I observe, is duly set forth, as is the duty of every caterer
for the public, but without any yelling and shouting about "gigantic
and stupendous success," which is as irritating as the newsboys'
cries of vamped-up latest intelligence in a sixth evening edition of
a penny paper at the time of an expected crisis, and as tiresome in
its repetition as the harsh screeching and monotonous bobbing of the
most conceited and idiotic Macaws, trying to attract the visitor's
attention to their sulphur-tapped polls.
To judge by the advertisements outside the booths, in Times'
Common Fair, never was the Drama in a more prosperous state than
now. Great Successes everywhere 1 Artists received with enthu-
siasm! Grand combinations of attractions! Behold, too, the
touching picture, drawn by himself, of an afflicted Manager ut-
terly overpowered by his uncontrollable emotion on seeing his house
nightly crowded by most illustrious audiences! I protest I am
disposed to mingle my tears with his, to pat him on the back, and
say, "Do not cry, Sir I Better days are in store for you. Bear
your hard fortune like a man! Bless yon! Liquor up!
Here is another calming the trembling fair ones in his auditorium,
and shouting to the occupants of stalls, boxes, dress-circle, pit,
and gallery that, on his word and honour, the conflagration on his
stage is not real; that he is only playing with fire; that his nervous
patrons need not stir from their seats, as the mechanist and scene-
painter are only " purtendin';" that he admits the admirable decep-
tion; and that, after all, he is, as it were, not the Lion, but plain
Bottom, the Weaver.
Through other speaking-trumpets, from " other lips and other"
lungs, come shouts of " Most Successful Revival ever Known! Walk
up!" "Most Brilliant Thing ever written, heard, or seen! Walk
up I Walk up!" "Thrilling Sensation Scene, nightly witnessed
with breathless interest! Walk up! Walk up!" Somebody, in
his Great Impersonation of Drunkenness, pronounced by all who see
it (there is a touch of modesty worthy of italics in this conditional
clause), to be a most powerful piece of acting!! Walk up!!
Genuine and Unequivocal Success!!! Engagements at Enor-
mous Cost! Walk upl The Greatest Artists in the World!
Unprecedented Success everywhere I Sound the trumpets, beat the
drums, drench your pocket-handkerchiefs with tears, clang the
cymbals! BUNKUM and CHUMMLES for ever!!
The Managerial motto is, " Whatever is is best," which he adapts
to circumstances. "Whatever is at my Theatre," he says, is
beat," and as long as this over-advertising is the fashion,
he can scarcely be blamed for acting up to what he wishes
to be supposed are his opinions. But why cannot all follow the
example of the Prince of Wales's and the Charing Cross Theatre?
One quiet sensible advertisement each; and another "under the
clock?'
I notice that, just at this time, the Vaudeville has nothing very
startling in the way of advertisement: a sign, though not an
infallible one, of material prosperity. The St. James's is quiet too,
though it has three shouts. Bat why is not the single affiche " under
the clock" sufficient P or say, at most, one under the clock and one
in the adjoining column?
My friend WAOQ drops in with an observation. He has, he says,
a suggestion for the "proud manager" of the Lyceum, who, as one
of the most enlightened and 'cutest people on airth, will probably
avail himself of the notion. WAGG proposes that as Sing Charles
wears a marvellous peruke, and Mr. Cromwell is nearly bald, it
would be well to lighten the advertisement by announcing " MB.
BELMOBE in his vigorous assumption," &c., and " Ms. IBVINQ in his
wiggyrous assumption." WAGG means well, poor fellow.
MB. GTE has hung out his banner on the wall. He announces,
among other things, Mosf in Egitto. How will the great Lawgiver,
&o., make up? WAGG of course answers " with 'air on," an ancient
jest for which he would be deservedly plucked in a Lambeth exami-
nation, or receive the Jo MILLEB scholarship in All Fools University.
Time Works Wonders at the Globe. "Now MONTAGUE, sit fast!
I seek for thee." as King Edward says in So. 2, Act v., Part iii.
HEN. VI., which is a longish reference for a short quotation, but of
course this revival is a thing to be seen, that is, when the govern-
ment of the Weather settles itself into something resembling a con-
sistent policy. Till this happens, a brave indoor soldier, and not
afraid to face the fiercest fire is
YOTJB REPBESENTATIVE.
A WOMAN'S QUESTION.
Is it really illegal for British subjects to wear foreign decorations?
If so, the law in this respect, if enforced, would deprive women of a
right which they probably value more than all the other rights they
claim, or which are claimed for them, put together. What is a
chignon but a foreign decoration; indeed, what feminine decoration
can be named that is of native origin? All the fashions are imported
from Paris; not a fringe, trimming, feather, flower, or bow, but is
of French origin; much of the false hair probably comes from
foreign prisons and hospitals. The rights of women are not so far
recognised abroad as to render them eligible for Orders of nobility
and knighthood; but there are still foreign crosses and ribbons
which they have hitherto been wont to decorate themselves withal
in profusion without let or hindrance, but would have to discard
them all immediately if there existed a law which forbade them
from wearing foreign decorations under penalty of fine or im-
prisonment.

Who bore his flag of " Peace, good-will to men,"

Leagued to spread light of letters through the land.
And sure a hope forlorn they might be deemed,
Who of assault on that strong fortress dreamed,
Where, guarded close by Prejudice and Pride,

Long was the leaguer, toilsome, large of cost,
And oft the cauae to fainter hearts seemed lost,
But he was of those sanguine, cheery souls
Who through the races' dust still see the goals;
Still his strong frame was toughest-braced for toil.
His hand still darkest with the seemly soil
Of the black press, from whose ink-streams a light
Was yet to radiate through England's night.
Ofttimes the fuel well-nigh failed his flame,
And Ruin stood between him and his aim,
But manfully he grappled the grim foe,
Nor ever yielded sword, though oft struck low.
And his reward was that he lived to see
Cheap Letters broad-cut sown, and Knowledge free!

NEWS FROM A STAR.
A VERT curious and suggestive volume, called Another World,
has lately come under the eye of Mr. Punch. It is what may be
called a Romance of Satire, and, unlike most books that are in-
tended to do two things at once, it effects both. The scene is laid in
another Star than our own, as the following morceau will prove :—
"The women are instructed in our planet as to the art of pleasing, and
the handsomest and most gifted exert themselves to this end. They are
required to attend to their personal appearance abroad and at home. The
married especially are enjoined to attend to tins as much in the presence of
their hutbands ai before strangers. A different custom prevailed in former
times, when women, after they had been sometime married, thinking that
their husband's affection was secured, gave themselves no further care to
please him, though still taking pains to appear handsome and fascinating to
others. It was for visitors and strangers that the most comely apparel and
the most engaging manners were put on; the consequence was, that the bus-
bind often preferred the society of those who, in appearance at least, seemed
to care more for him than did hia own wife."
Well, yes, there is something to be said for Another World. But
taking into consideration present prices of feminine apparel, we
think that our own system is the best—certainly the most economi-
cal. If the beloved ones of our bosoms came down to the domestic
dinner every day, arrayed in all their war-paint, what they would
gain by our admiration of their charms they would lose on our in-
vestigation of our cheque-books. Every star its own system. Yet we
should like to see the arrangements so daintily described in the
book in question; for see how the ladies of that world dress their
hair. Wnat does L» Pallet say to this ?—
"la the hair is sometimes worn an ornament forming two wings, each con-
sisting of a single diamond, which moves on small fine hinges, and is so
arranged that the least breath of air will set it in motion. In the centre,
uniting the two wings, is a small crimson stone, surmounted by a large round
stone of purple-blue, from which sprouts out a very fine dagger of a greenish
gold colour. The rest of the head-dress is made of fine metal, chosen for its
lightness, of the same tints. These metals are of equal, perhaps greater,
value than gold, but are chosen for their qualities. The necklace and anklets
correspond in character to the head-dress, with the addition to the former of
one large pearl, which hangs to the wings, and rests on the lady's bosom."

A NEW LEGEND.
THE telegraph (eleotrio, not Daily) relates another
remarkable statement of the POPE'S. In reply to an
address presented by PBINCK LICHTF.NSTEIN to His
Holiness:—
"The POPB >aid he rejoiced at this international demon-
stration, and cited the example of St. Peter, who spoke to several
nations at once."
Did he? We know that St. Peter may be credited
with having; been extraordinarily endowed with the
ability to speak the languages of all nations; but the
fact that he was accustomed to speak, or ever spoke
several of them, or any more than one of them at a
time, if that is what we are to understand, is new to us.
Or if it be that St. Peter, whether speaking several
languages at a time, or only one, was heard and under-
stood by a plurality of nations all at once, the extraor-
dinary gift of hearing and understanding which this
implies on the part of those nations, is something equally
new. We would the POPE would take us with him, as
Falstaff s&ya; what means His Holiness? SIR OEOBOB
BOWTEB will perhaps explain in a letter to the Times;
and, while his hand is in, be so good as to mention also,
fur our better satisfaction, if he can tell, whether the
Holy Father, when he made the statement that St. Peter
spoke to several nations at once, was standing or sitting;
as the view to take of it might be materially modified by
the knowledge of the circumstance that it was or was not
delivered ex cathedra.

Dear friends, has been compelled his great mistake for to bewail.

help of tricksy spirits, they dp all the clever tricks attributed by
Spiritists to the agency of Spirits ; and do them not in total darkness,
but in blazing gaslight. With his hands fast tied behind him, Ma.
CooKE_takcs off his tail-coat in six seconds, and in six more puts it
on again; and Ms. MASKKLYNE, who measures about five feet eight
in length, crams himself into a box which is only three feet long,
and twenty inches wide, and then covers it with canvass, and knots
a cord inside.
Unbelievers as we are in the tales of table-turning, we rejoice to
see the tables turned upon the turners, and we return our hearty
thanks to MESSIEURS MASKELYNE and COOKE for showing us con-
clusively that many so-called spirit movings are merely feats of
muscle, and that simpletons who put their trust in the Spirits of the
Spiritists, are not above proof of being simply humbugged.

sity,

THE SPIRITUAL ART OF SINKING.
E have, it appears, heathen
in our midst, not only at
Whiteohapel and there-
abouts, but likewise at
Cambridge; and there not
only in the Borough, but
in the University too. A
paragraph in the Times
announces that the BISHOP
or ELT and BISHOP
CLAUGHTON, assisted by
«ome neighbouring clergy-
men, have been holding a
number of "Mission Ser-
vices" for the benefit of
both Town and Gown;
special addresses having
been delivered to both
men and women, and, at
the request of students,
members of the Univer-
services having been
in College rooms
besides all which, open-
air preaching has been
conducted in Barnwell ,
•where, as elsewhere, let us
hope that it will have led
to practice. That the
discourses delivered by the Right Reverend Prelate and their
reverend auxiliaries to both undergraduates and townsfolk were
of a highly practical nature as a rule, may be inferred from
their connection with certain proceedings, which seem to have
constituted rather an exception. "On Friday afternoon there was
a conference in the Town Hall, the subject being ' The Deepening of
Spiritual Life.'" This statement is unaccompanied by the expla-
nation it requires. What can " The Deepening of Spiritual Life"
possibly mean? The heightening of spiritual life one understands;
but can hardly understand its deepening, unless iu a sense appa-
rently not contemplated by the BISHOP OK ELY and the assembly
over which his Lordship presided; namely, that of depression, as
opposed to elevation — a spiritual alacrity at sinking.
The deepening of spiritual life is a phrase which maybe considered
to have been illustrated by MILTON in plain English, as well as in
grand poetry, where he makes a Spirit, whose spirituality is under
zero, complain of being situated at a profundity such that, ever
sinking, he has "in the lowest deep a lower deep" still yawning
beneath him. Of course the spiritual life which goes on deepening
in this way is just that from which ministration towards the rescue
of their fellow-creatures, as well as endeavour to obtain their own,
is supposed to be the reason of all clergymen's existence.
When the Pilgrim, in the song, runs up the mountain shoutjng
"Excelsior!" is that imperfect Latinist to be taken as symbolising
the deepening of spiritual life P In that case, deepening means
increasing altitude; and certainly a hill is as deep as it is high: so
is a river or a bowl of punch, or anything else. To deepen, accord-
ing to DR. JOHNSON, in a secondary sense, is "to make sad or
gloomy." We should be glad to be assured that a moody countenance,
and black looks, betokening low spirits, are not the characteristic
symptoms of that deepening of spiritual life which was canvassed
the other Friday at the clerical conversazione in the Cambridge
Town Hall. Those are the physiognomical indications of advanced
atrabiliousness, of which a suspicion may be entertained by many
that the deepening of spiritual life is one of the forms. In that
case, certain doses of calomel, blue-pill, taraxacum, or podo-
phyllin, might be recommended in cases of the deepening of spiritual
life; an affection expressed in terms of art seeming rather to savour
of the religious novel than of the formularies of the Church of
England. _
The Kan in Possession.
ACCORDING to a letter from Berlin, PKINCE BISUARCK will not
consent to the complete evacuation of French territory until the
whole of the indemnity is paid. In the meanwhile, if there were
any such wise men— well, let us say wiseacres, in the French
National Assembly as there are in another place, perhaps, some
of them would propose the abolition of capital punishment on the
ground that France has too much of an execution in the house
already. _
"THE BEST AND CHEAPEST ROUTE FOR IHELAJTD"— evidently
meaning the Potato.
"A CLERK THEEE WAS OF OXENFORDE."
Chaucer.
MR. PUNCH is gratified at reading in the Era that a banquet ha*
been given to MR. JOHN OXENFORD, and that his portrait hag also
been presented to him. The majority of those who rendered these
tributes are connected with the Drama. Literature, however, also
owes a debt to a scholar of varied accomplishment, a humorist of
the best type, and, let Mr. Punch add, in these days of "graphic
slip-slop, a writer of pure and admirable English. Mr. P. tills
his own glass to MB. 0., and ere emptying it, winks, which other-
wise unjustifiable demonstration implies a demand when MR. OXEN-
FORD intends to publish anything more of a Rabelaisian character.
'Tis "looked for at his hand." This said, Mr. Punch who is every-
thing as well as critical, but can also be that, would note that the
gentleman who proposed MR. OXENFORD'S health insisted on a fact
in which that gentleman's very highest excellence does not seem
to lie. "It was a proud thing for ,him to remember that he had
never drawn a tear from one man, woman, or child whom he had
had, in the course of a long career to pass judgment upon in his
official capacity." It is a natural thing that to a theatrical gentle-
man this should seem a very proud thing. Well, as regards "woman
or child," let that pass. No one would willingly make either cry,
except for joy. But as regards " man"—well. Firstly, a man who
blubs over anything that can be written against him is a booby whom
it were gross flattery to call an ass, so we have no compassion for
him. But secondly, who or what is an actor that he is not to be
treated as honestly and severely as a Painter, Sculptor, Author,
Composer, or any other artist? Why is he not to be flagellated, if
he deserves it? Echo answers that she has not the slightest idea.
But as regards MR. OXENFOKD'S criticisms, the truth is that he is
a master of the English language, and his criticisms on stupidity,
or vulgarity, or negligence are so deftly conveyed, that while they
are perfectly lucid to those who read between the lines, a stupid,
vulgar, or negligent person fails to comprehend that he is being
scarified. The educated public is informed, and our "blubbing
friend is still happy. MR. OXENFORD is too well aware of his critical
responsibilities to evade his duty, and those who "are not simple
men" admire alike his perspicacity, and his subtlety of literary art.
There, that's Mr. Punch's speech for the Oxenford banquet, and
now he pledges his friend J. 0. in a cup like unto that of one FRIAB
JOHN of the Funnels.
LIBERTY AND LICENCE.
THEATRICAL Managers in general seem pretty well content, on the
whole, that plays and playhouses should continue to be licensed by
the LORD CHAMBERLAIN. They do not, apparently, want a Licen-
sing Apt passed for the increment of their liberties. They are not
so anxious to be put, as to their licences, on a footing with the pub-
licans, as they should be, if, as we are told, the Public-house Licen-
sing Act "works well." No doubt they would find a Playhouse
Licensing Act "work" equally "well" in the estimation of the
Prigs and Precisians of the Sabbatarian persuasion, most of whom
would like to see theatres shut up as well as taverns on every day
of the week as well as on Sunday, and who will soon, perhaps, begin
to agitate for a Permissive Prohibitory Act to prohibit not only
"intoxicating" liquors, but dramatic performances too.
No Demand for Salmon.
IN a summary of the proceedings of the House of Commons on the
eventful night when MR. GLADSTONE announced the resignation of
the Ministry, it was not surprising to read at the close, that " No
attention was paid to an entreaty from MR. DiLLwrs that he might
be permitted to carry his Salmon Fisheries Bill a formal stage on."
Members had other fish to fry. Official men had other fishes (and
loaves) to look after.
Something Bright in the Future.
MATERFAMILIAS, still mourning over her coal merchant's account,
is most anxious that Parliament should not be dissolved before it
has passed " the Fires Bill," which she was glad to see had been
found so interesting by the House of Commons that they read it a
second time.
Another "Way.
SOM KIIOD v is advertising a preparation which, among other merits,
is warranted to keep a lady's hand free from chaps. Punch knows
another way to effect this. Let her dress in the present fashion, and
have it known that she has no money. Chaps, if they are Sensible
chaps, will let her hand alone very severely.

URBI ET OREL
TnERE is an Old Gentleman site on a Hill,
(By the last Roman mail, he was sitting there still-
There 's but one Hill now. where once were seven) -
And he calls himself the Vicegerent of Heaven.
Thence, East and West, and South, and North,
Much brutum fulmen he thunders forth,
At Princes and Peoples, and Kingdoms and Kings,
Lay-thought, Light, Reason, and other things,
Which stand in this Old Gentleman's way,
And pooh-pooh his infallible say!
For this Old Gentleman flatters himself
He locks all Truth on his cupboard-shelf;
And keeps the keys of Heaven and Hell,
And conscience of Kings and Nations as well;
That whithersoever, Ex-Cathedra,
His will may point, there lies the way;
That whene'er he says "Thus it is," *tis thus,
Singing, "Semper, tibique, ab omnibus ;"
And so this Old Gentleman sits on his Hill,
In the teeth of the times proclaiming his will.
But much as this Old Gentleman may
Atop of his Hill have it all his own way,
'Tis not the less true that, beyond his Hill,
Light still is light, and Reason still .
Is reason, whate'er this Old Gentleman's will!
That Kings decline to Priests to yield,
And narrow the fence of the old Church field;
That more and more The Church's fight
With the State is a strife twixt dark and light;
And though all's not light that for Heht is shown,
None wish to change even half-light for none.
VOL. T.TTT.
Once this Old Gentleman saw, around,
Naught but bowed heads, uncrowned and crowned:
But, one by one, the crowned heads have dropped off,
Some with a sigh, and some with a scoff,
Till now, about the Old Gentleman's chair,
The deuce a head with a crown is there!
But an epicene crowd of skirmish-fighters,
In petticoats, priests' birettas, and mitres,
Each mumbling his hocus-pocus charm,
With his oonjuring-books beneath his arm;
Of Fathers and Casuists large provision,
All in the latest Jesuit edition;—
Some, plain Roman calf, without letters, confined in,
And some, in Ritualist half-binding:
But the bolder their hocus-pocus tricks.
The greater the poor Old Gentleman's tir!
For all the brisker they bid him ban,
The less the Old Gentleman feels he can;
And the louder they make their old lion roar,
Echo but mocks him, more and more;
Till, at each new peal of Vatican thunder,
Says Europe, "What old scold's that, I wonder?"
Of late, they thought a bolt had struck,
And kneeled to give thanks for a stroke of luck,
When, by the blast of the POPE'S brass band,
At wave of CULLER'S staff of command.
An ill-built Liberal wall was brought down,
In an avalanche, on GLADSTONE'S crown.
But, bless the Old Gentleman, if he dreams
That that will forward his Vatican schemes!
Rather twixt them and us 'twill fix
A higher fence of good English bricks,
Than the six feet of ill-set Irish stone,
Which, all things considered, is better o'erthrown.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
-BANQUILLISE yOUTBelf,
Madam, the comedy of
Much Ado About No-
thing has been played
and withdrawn, and
the Westminster Ma-
nager has announced
All's Well that Ends
Well.
Mr. Punch had
some thought of stop-
ping here, and leaving
those lines as his
Essence for the Week.
But you are kind
enough to say, and
wise enough to know
that it is good for you
to hear him talk, and
therefore he will ex-
pound the story of the
Retirement and Re-
turn of Ma. GLADSTONE
at a little more length,
and with some of Mr.
Punch's accustomed
felicities of illustra-
tion.
On the afternoon of
Monday, the 17th of
March, Saint Patrick's
Day, the Lords met,
but EABL GRANVILLB
got rid of them in
twenty minutes, ask-
ing them to come
again on the Thursday.
The DUKE OP RICH-
MOND AND LENNOX
entirely approved this
course.
In the Commons, MB. GLADSTONE, "stepping into his place from behind the
SPEAKER'S chair" (this is very important, and we hope, dear Madam, that you
will remember it, for no step in MR. GLADSTONE'S career should he unnoticed),
made a short speech.
He had been passing Sunday in the country. He might have said, but did
not, that he had been
"At Clieveden's proud alcove,
The bower of naughty SHREWSUUKY and love."
While in that alcove he received an intimation from the QUEEN to the effect
that MB. DISRAELI would not make a new Ministry. HER MAJESTY graciously
inquired, therefore, whether MR. GLADSTONE would resume office, and to this
he replied that he would, and also that he would ascertain from his late col-
leagues how far they were disposed to do the same. He proposed that the
House should again adjourn until the Thursday, in order to give him time to
make arrangements. "For there is a form in these things, Madam, there is a
form," as Lady Blarney says; or is it Miss Skeggs? The moral is the same.
MR. DISRAELI said that he should be silent. That is, he would defer explana-
tions. But he begged that it might be distinctly understood that he had at
once informed HEB MAJESTY that he was ready to make a very good Ministry,
but that he could not work with the present House of Commons.
MR. GLADSTONE repeated that it was not until Sunday that he had abandoned
the expectation that MB. DISRAELI would make a Ministry.
Then we all went away. Mr. Punch, whose every act must be interesting to
you, Madam, proceeded to dine with the LORD MAYOR at the Mansion House.
The banquet was served in the Long Parlour, which has been re-decorated, with
taste and splendour, by MESSRS. GILLOW, and the menu was perfect. As,
however, the season was that of Lent, Mr. Punch of course felt bound to
restrain his somewhat Epicurean tendencies, and he confined himself to one
plate of tortue, two of tortue claire, some filets de truite a la Tartars, some
whitebait, some timbale d'ecrtvitsss, a few mauviettes out of a lovely ponding,
somejambon au vin, a slice of dindonneau pique, some Marrow-Pudding, which
the Scotch bard has worthily celebrated as
"My winsome Marrow,"
some pouding a la Nesselrode, and some anchois en canapf (this is a very pretty
way of putting it, but the canapi is toast), with a few other trifles. He compli-
ments MESSRS. RING & BRYMER on the e_leganoe of the feast, and he gratefully
thanks the LORD MAYOR for having discouraged something, and encouraged
something else, to which things (the party not having been an official one)
Mr. Punch's sense of propriety prevents his making further allusion; but those
who are in the habit of " sitting at good men's feasts " will easily be able to say
what it is the greatest bore to have, and what to lack.
Now, Madam, are you familiar with COWPER'S poems?
If not, pray become so. But you almost indignantly
reply that of course you are. Very good. Then you
recollect a passage in Retirement f The patriot states-
man resolves to leave office and go into the country.
"Tis done—he steps into the welcome chaise,
Lolls at his ease behind four handsome bays,"
("Bays" means horses, but MR. GLADSTONE most
likely took the G. W. R.)
"Which whirl away from business and debate
The disencumbered Atlas of the State."
("Self-made men" will please to understand that
"Atlas" does not mean a book of maps. There are
none at the Treasury—though plenty at the Foreign
Office,—and, if there were, MR. GLADSTONE would not
think it right to take them out of town with him.)
Well, the country stagnation—miscalled repose—soon
begins to pall upoa the brilliant man of the world, and
'' He feels, while grouping at his faded joys,
A secret thirst for his renounced employs,
Blames his own indolence, observes, tho1 late,
'Tis criminal to leave a sinking State;
Flies to the Itvtt, and, received with grace,
Kneels, kis*es hands, and shines again in place."
MB. GLADSTONE certainly had not much time to get
tired of the country, but the rest of the story is suffi-
ciently applicable, and, Madam, whether a quotation
exactly fits or not is of no consequence. It is tie poet's
fault if he has not written with accuracy, it is your busi-
ness to show that you have read the poet, and have a
Macaulayish memory.
Thursday.—There were Ministerial explanations in
the Lords, but you do not want the story twice over, and
the Leaders in the Commons were much more explanatory
than the aristocrats.
'j'Nith MR. GLADSTONE. We will resume our offioes.
(Cheerf.) I did not quite understand MR. DISRAELI'S
written reply to the (iuBE», and I wrote this to HER
MAJESTY. On Friday evening I was satisfied that he had
unconditionally refused office. But I:drew up a paper
on the subject, which I sent to the QUEEN, who gave it
to him. He forwarded his answer to HEB MAJESTY on
Sunday evening. [After church, we hope.] When I
received it, I saw that it was unequivocal.
Now MR. GLADSTONE, it seems, holds that an Oppo-
sition has no right to give a fatal vote, unless prepared
to take the place of the men put out. This view he,
being desirous to put MR. DISRAELI in the wrong, pre-
sented to the QUEEN. But MR. DISRAELI is particularly
ready with an answer, and he responded vigorously to
Ma. GLADSTONE, in another paper sent to HER MAJESTY.
Mr. Punch, as the QUEEN'S private and personal friend,
begs leave to intimate that it is too bad of these two
gentlemen to trouble the QUEEN with their views. Let
them fight matters out in the House, and not at
Windsor.
The PREMIER did not disguise the fact that he had
desired rest, and thought that he had earned it. Also
he admitted that the fortunes of a Revived Government
were not very good. Touching this he quoted Horace,
Liber iii., Carmen v.
"Nequc amissos colores
Luna refert medicata fuoo;
Nee vera virtus, cum seme! cxcidit,
Curat reponi deterioribus."
You understand every thing, Madam, and need not
to be told (yet we tell you) HORACE'S meaning is that
when wool has been once dyed, no washing thereof will
entirely restore its delicate whiteness. The quotation
in itself was happy, but does MR. GLADSTONE wish his
Administration to be known as the "Washed-Out
Ministry"?
He distinctly declared that he had no intention of dis-
solving early, or at any particular time. He should
proceed with business on the old principles, and he
trusted to have the confidence and support of the House.
MR. DISRAELI spoke at great length. He had some-
thing to do besides make explanations. He had to talk
to the Nation. He had to show what humiliations and
torturings he should have had to undergo had he taken
office with a hostile majority of 88 to 00. There was no
common bond, he said, between him and the Irish, who
had enabled him to defeat the Government. Nor did he

see his way to a dissolution. What was he to dissolve upon? A dissolu-
tion would not have been justified. Nor was he bound to take office.
An Opposition could not have a matured policy to be ready at a
moment's notice, when an accident might defeat a Ministry. He
had already tried the experiment of governing; with a minority, and
he was not going to do it again. The Government, however, had
had no business to resign. They knew that they meant to sacrifice
educational interests to the Romish hierarchy, and they had
expected the votes of all the Catholic Members. However, MB. GLAD-
STONE had made it a question of honour; that had been vindicated,
and now let him return to his work. Then the Leader of Opposition
pronounced an eulogium on the Tory party, which, he said, held the
most satisfactory position it had filled since the time of MB. PITT
and LORD GRENVILLE. Financial Questions were all settled, but
now all our institutions were menaced—the rights of the Crown, the
existence of an aristocracy, of the Church, of Property in Land, and
these will become great and burning questions. Then will come the
time for a great, intelligent, and organised Party to step forward u
the guardian of National Interests.
After this there was some small talk, and the House was Counted
Out early. And, to parody good old CM VUCKH, Madam, though we
are sure you never read the original,—
"Thus BENJAMIN hU WILLIAM doth defy,
But WILLIAM is once more set up on high;
And PADDY'S priests lament the mended breach:
That tale is done. Heaven save us all and each!"
Friday.—The Lords wisely stayed at home, out of the way of the
savage March wind;—we admire CANON KINGSLET to excess, but
the encouragement he has given to this abominable blast would
make us remonstrate with him. but that it has got into our throat
and deprived us of the power of objurgation. His health, in a cup
of fine old gruel.
In the Commons, MB. GATHORNE HARDY moved a Resolution
about the Geneva Arbitrators' interpretation of the Three Rules, of
which he wishes HER MAJESTY'S disapprobation to be declared to
all nations in general, and America in particular.
Now touching that Geneva decision Mr. Punch has no desire to
say anything unpleasant. The business is done, and let us have
doue with the business. But it is known in Society that very high
authority does not hesitate to say very unpleasant things indeed on
the subject. Your "finger to your nose "—we beg pardon—" your
lip, thus," Madam, for the present.
The question was debated at great length, and with ability. MR.
FOKSTKK said that the vote would be one of censure on the Arbi-
trators, and he did not think that course would be dignified.
Moreover, we were not bound, for the future, by anything the
Arbitrators had said in excess of their Commission. Some strong
men spoke, and, in the end, MR. GLADSTONE undertook that when
other nations were asked to accept the Rules, they should be "dis-
encumbered of recitals." Rather a dull story, dear Madam, and
the House relieved its mind by some fierce little divisions, on Supply.
We sat till nearly two, though, and then fled away into the dark-
ness and the winds, like KEATS' Lovers on the Eve of St. Agnes.

than usual, for solid
reasons connected
with the time of
high-water at Lon-

the Editor of the
Nautical Almanack
will be happy to
\£ explain to any one
j=t who may favour him
/G\ with a call on the
following Tuesday.
The Vice-Chancellors, Heads of Houses, Doctors, Proctors, Professors, and
other eminent dignitaries of the two Universities, escorted by a guard of
honour composed of gentlemen in statu pupillari, will take their places in the
seats set apart for them by the Thames Conservancy, punctually at the hour
appointed Dy Convocation, wet or dry. The Creweian oration, in accordance
with ancient custom, will then be delivered by a member of the Oxford crew.
(N.B. No Collection.)
Immediately afterwards, the Vice-Chancellors will drop their handkerchiefs,
and the straggle will commence.
The two boats are teak-built, lined with satin-wood, and registered at
Lloyd's as A 1. One of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House will act as
Starter, the FIBST LORD OF TEDS ADMIRALTY will officiate as Judge, and the
J CDGB OF THE ADMIRALTY CouHT will be present as Umpire. The result of the
race will be proclaimed from Hammersmith Bridge by Blue Mantle. The
course will be the same as usual—riding, driving, or steaming down, lunching,
laughing, flirting, betting, cheering, steering, afternoon tea, dining, dancing,
glancing, and going home when it is time to return.
The Railway arrangements for the day may be known on personal application
at the different Booking-offices and the Board of Trade, and by reading the
placards displayed at the various Stations north of the Thames and south of
the Trent. Special trains may be engaged by those willing to pay for them.
During their stay in London and the suburbs, the following places of amuse-
ment wUl be thrown open to the two University crews, free of charge, on
showing their colours and certificate of matriculation—the British Museum,
the National Gallery, the South Kensington Museum, the Law Courts, and .the
Royal Exchange. If the crews can arrange to visit Westminster Abbey and
St. Paul's, in company, a reduction wUl be made in the usual scale of charges.
Application to be made to the Verger in residence.
All persons intending to be present at the race, who are not thoroughly well
acquainted with aquatic sports, are urgently recommended to give their nights
and days to the study of the sporting papers, so that they may be able to dis-
tinguish one end of the boat (either Oxford or Cambridge, it makes no difference)
from the other, to explain the use and construction
of the new "patent sliding seats," and avoid the la-
mentable error of confounding the coxswain with the
stroke. They should also dismiss from their minds all
prejudices in favour of one University over the other—
shunning any such conspicuous symbol of partisanship
as a broad band of blue ribbon round their hats— and
generally strive to conduct themselves as Britons, who
for many centuries past have been in the invariable habit
of ruling the waves.
No prophecy, prediction, or other vaticination will
be hazarded here as to the result of the race, the choice
being so very restricted, lying between but two opposing
parties. Oxford may win, if Victory should once more
smile on the Dark Blue, or the success of Cambridge
may be a mathematical certainty if Fortune again prefers
the lighter shade in ribbons, silks, and other materials
for ladies' dresses; or both may claim a triumph if the
race should prove a dead heat. But one thing is clear,
that, allowing for accidents, the best men are sure to
win; and if anyone is not satisfied with this significant
hint, let him be at Corney Reach or the Soap Works
during business hours between now and then, and watch
the course of events with the acumen of a Judge, the
impartiality of a critic, and the field-glass of any
respectable optician.
Genuine Irish Grievance.
AN Irish grievance, which may be felt, although it
has not been expressed, is a form of oath which, pecu-
liarly constituted as the national mind of Ireland is,
compels a large proportion of the jurors of that country
very frequently to incur the disrepute, in prejudiced
British opinion, of committing perjury. They have to
swear that they will " a true verdict give, according to
the evidence." Justice to Ireland clearly requires that,
in the Irish juryman's oath, for "according to the
evidence" should be substituted " aocording_to the reli-
S'on of the parties concerned and the direction of your
desk"
Prosperity on Paper.
UNDER the able management of our CHANCELLOR OF
THE EXCHEQUER, the Revenue amounts to the amazing
total of £76,000,000. Happy we. What a prodigiously
wealthy nation! Perish individuals. A surplus of
nearly five millions sterling for us all, and a coal and
meat famine for every one.
A SLOVEN'S PLEA.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
Visits the Queen's, and, in reporting as usual to the Editor, draws
the attention of the public to a distinguished sporting character
in the drama of" Old London."

Y Sir, I represented You, the other
night at the Queen's. Let me advise
lovers of the genuine old melodramatic
school of art to see Old London.
Dick Wrattett is played by Miss
HODSOIT as prettily as though, con-
found him, he were a lad of most
unquestionable morality. Never was there such a fascinating,
worthless, charming, unprincipled, amiable, wicked, dutiful, cruel
scamp. Miss HODSON'S Dick is a sort of Aladdin Jack Sheppard
Prince Hal Paul Clifford, all rolled into one: indeed in the French
original Jack was discovered to be the heir to the Throne, and was
only pardoned on condition of abandoning his claim. The Old Mint
on fire is very effective, and Old London Bridge, one of the best
"sets" seen for a long time, and an exciting situation into the
bargain.
But what especially took my fancy, as your Representative, and
what ought to draw to the Queen's all old and young London, all
middle-aged London, and particularly all patrons of pigeon-shooting,
sportsmen, and members of the Gun Club is the astonishing pistol-
practice of Velvet Grawl the villain.
The object of this weak-headed person's life —he evidently being
of a sportingturn—was, as I gathered from his actions, to shoot
little Dicky Wrastell, whom he appears to have considered, perhaps
being misled by the name, as a little Dicky-bird. From morning
to night the aim, literally the aim of his existence, was to catch the
unwary Dick alone if possible, or, failing that, to have a shot at him
in company; his chief point being to get within two feet of him any-
where, an easy shooting distance, which you might think would have
rendered the chance of his hitting him somewhere extremely pro-
bable. Revolvers not having been invented in those days, Grawl,
I am sorry to say, must have suffered considerable inconvenience
from the necessity of having to provide himself with, at least, six
pistols, in order to get half-a-dozen shots; and, at seven for six-
pence, I am bound to sayjhe would have made the fortune of any
one speculating in the hire of firearms ready-loaded. These weapons
were craftily bestowed about his person, much as. I suppose, not
being strictly in the secret, a conjuror conceals the fish-bowl, cannon-
ball, and canaries in a cage, which he is presently going to produce
from under his handkerchief. But a conjuror thus furnished cannot
sit down. Now these pistols of the make of GBOBGB THE FIRST'S
time were not light elegant little pea-shooters, a dozen of which
could be carried in a lady's reticule. No, they were things so con-
structed as to render even momentary f orgetf ulness of their presence
in your tailcoat pocket almost impossible, and interfered with the
set of your clothes as awkwardly as a parcel containing a pair
of boots. Like all true lovers of" sport, Velvet Gratel could
evidently put up with these inconveniences, provided that the sport
itself occasionally came in his way: and only once did I see Velvet
Orawl take a chair, and that was in Sir Randolph's study,
whither he had come without his weapons, at least I suppose he
must have forgotten them (and didn't like to ask if he might
send a servant for them), from their not being employed by
him, when a glorious "opportunity offered itself, fora fair certainty,
at three inches. Such a chance, thought I, you won't have
again, my friend. He did though, or very nearly: but all through
this scene he was scowling and muttering to himself, probably
confounding his ill-luck which had made him forget his pistols
just when they would have come in so handy, reminding me
of the sentiments of a gentleman, who, after mature debate with
himself as to whether he should walk out, with, or without his
umbrella, decides for the latter, and is caught in a pelting shower.
I've got no sort of doubt that Grawl said to himself before
he left bis own house, "Now, let me see, shall I want my
pistols or shall I not? I might meet Dick on the way, and have
a shot, but it isn't very likely. So on the whole I '11 consider this
an off-day, and perhaps, as I am going to pay a. visit, it will be more
comfortable." So he left them behind him. He was soon to be
compensated, however, for his oversight, for, in the very next scene
but one, he had a regular field-day of it. This came off " in a cellar
of the ' Magpie and Stump.'" Here Velvet Grawl was perfectly
reckless with pistols. The cellar was as light as a Belgravian
Drawing-room on a ball-night, with a fair sprinkling of company,
who were evidently accustomed to Grawl, and were prepared to
humour his little ways of bringing out pistols and having a pot-shot
or two at anybody who might offer himself as a tempting mark.
The reason of this general toleration of his peculiar foible was
soon apparent to the meanest capacity.
Whatever Velvet Growl's original intentions may have been, he
was, practically, perfectly harmless when trusted with loaded
pistols—that is, under certain conditions. Only give him a fair-
sized person, in a moderately conspicuous dress, placed in a good
strong light—broad daylight preferred—and within a foot of the
muzzle of his weapon, and as sure as is a falling stone to obey the
laws of gravitation, so certain was Velvet Grawl to miss the
most obvious shot. It was a thousand pounds to a bread-crumb
in favour of the person at whom he aimed. No Life Insurance
Company of the period would have refused Dick Wrastell on the
sworn testimony of any friend that Velvet Grawl was going to shoot
at him from all quarters, in all places, at any hour from 10 to 3, and
every day in the year. "He here!" exclaimed Velvet Grawl,
when, on seeing Dick in the cellar, he was quite unable to repress
his sporting instinct, and lugged out a pistol to have a good steady
shot at him. Old Nollekins baulked him, however—a proceeding
which had the character of obtrusive friendliness, as it was really
quite unnecessary, and certainly called for no gratitude on the part
of Dick, who, with regard to Velvet Grawl and pistol-shooting,
might well say, "My dear friend, let him go on; it pleases him,
and it doesn't hurt me."
Presently Dick stood close at GrawFs elbow, and he never had
such a chance of a dead-shot as now, but for Dick's unfairly inter-
fering with the free action of his wrist. After this Grawl was quiet
for a few minutes, when suddenly the old uncontrollable desire
seized him, and exclaiming, "This time—now, at least, he shall not
escape me," or words to that effect, with which he generally pre-
faced his various misses, he levelled a pistol at Dick, which was,
however, gently taken from him and laid on the table. He yielded
it without even the mildest protest, and thereby Your Representa-
tive, Sir, was certain that he only did not complain of the removal
of his playthings because he knew well enough "there were more
where that came from "—namely, his pocket.
My divination was correct. Within five minutes he had hauled
out another, a larger and more terrible weapon, that might have
done some service on a swivel on the poop of an Elizabethan man-
of-war, and there being this time no obstacle in the road, he blazed
away at Dick to his heart's content. "Now," said I to myself, "if
I he misses him this time he couldn't hit the Great Pyramid at six
inches." Sir, Velvet Grawl could not hit the Pyramid at one inch
distance. After this feeble exhibition, Dick, as might be expected,
was more alive than ever, and, taking up the old pistol from the
table he pointed it at Grawl, who lost the presence of as much
mind as he had ever possessed, forgot his store of weapons, and
crediting Dick with a better eye for a mark than himself, obeyed
that young gentleman's command, and descended by a trap-door
into another cellar below this cellar, suggesting that even in this
deepest depth there was a deeper still.
In the Fourth Act he rushed down to Battersea with pistols, and
a bludgeon, which convinced me that repeated disappointments in
shooting had affected his brain, and I should not have been sur-
prised had I on the next opportunity seen him trying to take aim
with a walking-stick, or attempting to load a kitchen poker.
I believe, now, that this bludgeon was, after all, only taken up in
a moment of weakness and self-distrust, or, in a lucid interval:
either supposition being dependent upon the view adopted of Velvet
Growl's idiosyncrasy. He discarded the bludgeon when he went

SCENE—Hounds running; men pulling up, and hesitating at stone wall.
Very Young Lady (on clever Cob). "WILL THOSE WHO Do NOT MEAN TO JUMP GET OUT OF THE WAY FOR THOSE WHO Do t"
out on the river in a little boat with Sir Randolph, and onoe more
took to his pistols.
Never, never, was there such a chance as now! Dick's boat had
smashed, and Dick himself, in his white shirt-sleeves, was standing
in the angle of a buttress of old London Bridge, and sheltered from
Grawl by the side of the bridge itself.
Never had this undaunted sportsman such an opportunity to dis-
tinguish himself as now! I should not have bet on Dick now, nor
would a Company have risked his premium. Why? Because Grawl,
in a boat, on the further side of the archway away from his victim,
was compelled, by Dick's position in the angle, to shoot at him from
round the corner. Need I say that he missed again, and again.
Then he went away. I was anxious for his re-appearance, as I began
to be fearful lest continued failure might end in hopeless dejection,
when he would probably renounce pistol-shooting for ever, and join
the Society of Friends.
No. In another quarter of an hour he was out again, blazing
away; and where do you think P Why, of all places in the world,
on Hampstead Heath! Now here was a fair field, and no favour!
I was startled to find that a dense London fog had settled on this
suburban elevation.
Yea, now at last I trembled for the lives of such of Knra GEORGE'S
subjects as business, or pleasure, might have brought into this
locality.
There were, as it happened, numbers of people about on this foggy
day, including vague members of the British army—deserters,
perhaps, or out for a few leisure hours with the donkeys, and I
shuddered, for never during the whole play, even when snooting
round a right-angled corner, had Velvet Grawl been so truly
dangerous as now. What damage might not such a man do with
a pistol, in a fog! And so, alas! it turned put. Grawl was
quite in his element, and having made up his mind that somebody
in the fog was the object of his hitherto unrequited attentions, he
made the usual speech about " this time he shall not escape me,"
and fired—bang!—with the usual result, as far as Dick was con-
cerned, inasmuch as he did escape him, out with an unusual result
as far as the sport went, as the bullet had taken deadly effect on
Nolle!:ins, between whom and Dick (for whom Gratol had mistaken
him) there was about as much resemblance, physically, as between
the Norfolk Giant and a Norfolk biffin. When Grawl returned
(the i'oir having cleared off), to find that he had not made the bag
he had intended, he lost all heart, and surrendered himself to the
by whom I trust he was led off gently to Bethlehem
Hospital, where, doubtless, he would be easily kept quiet by amusing
him with Lowther Arcade toy-pistols, with which he could pop at
the keepers from morning to night.
Indeed, Sir, as representing You, I have not been so thoroughly
interested in any recent performance as this. Vive Velvet Grawl.'
I shouldn't like to be out shooting with him, on a moor, in a Scotch
mist.
0, my sporting friends, see Grawl, enjoy his bad shots, and applaud
the genuine hit as heartily as did YouK REPRESENTATIVE MAW.
HIPPO-MAGNETISM.
IT is well to call the art of inducing sleep, sleep-waking, and
other abnormal conditions of mind and body, Mesmerism, from the
name of its inventor, MESMER, rather than Animal Magnetism.
This latter denomination is best restricted to denote the magnetic
influence exerted by the lower animals. The most remarkable
instance of Animal Magnetism in this sense is presented by that
noble animal, the Horse. The attraction which this quadruped
acts on mankind withal far exceeds the strongest that any other
creature has for our species. Almost all men, of what character
soever, are more or less attracted by the horse; but among
them it is notorious that the majority consists of persons whose
character the horse's influence appears to lower exceedingly. Is
there an analogy between Animal Magnetism, emanating from the
horse, and fractional electricity in respect of induction? A body
positively electrified induces, yon know, a state of negative elec-
tricity on another near it. Is the Noble Animal, by a corresponding
magnetic action, apt to induce upon ostlers, grooms, jockeys, betting
men, and even gentlemen so-called about him, a negation of nobility t

THE SCHOOL OF THE STAKE.
AT the late Liverpool Catholic Chili Dinner, the
Papal Archbishop made a speech, in which he said
that
"The great question of education was of all the most
burning question, and at the general election it beboyed
Catholics to unite and to take distinct political action
on it."
No; the question has not yet arrived at the ex-
tremity of burning. But that is not the fault of
those of whom the zeal is so excessive that they
refuse to tolerate mixed education. It appears
not at all unlikely that, by uniting, and taking
distinct action on the question which their Primate
calls "burning," could his followers succeed in
obtaining a parliamentary majority, we should
have that question settled by re-enactment of the
statute De Hteretico comburendo.
Chemistry of Law Reform.
THERE is talk about a contemplated "fusion of
Law with ^Equity." Perhaps, if this be effected,
the resulting amalgam will be innocent, or even
salutary, ouch' is sometimes the case with a
compound the constituents of which are deadly
poisons.
CLASSICAL AND COMMEHCIAL.—WHEN is a blun-
dering schoolboy like a fraudulent shopkeeper ?—
When he makes a false quantity.
ULTRAMONTANE HISTORY.
GIVEN, a Catholic University of Ireland a hundred years hence,
with a Professorship of Modern History, what are the students in
that seat of learning likely to be taught to make out of the following
telegram from Berne, preserved, peradventure, in some historical
record ?—
"The Government of Berne hare resolved to suspend all the Catholic
Clergy who refute to obey its decrees for carrying out tha decision of the
diocesan conference at JBasle."
Is it not possible that this statement will be quoted as attesting
the fact of a persecution, A.D. 1873, in Switzerland as cruel as any
endured by the Christians of the Roman empire under NERO and
DIOCLETIAN? Will the Catholic undergraduates not be taught,
accordingly, and that in perfect good faith on their teachers' part,
that the Government of Berne, in announcing their intention to
suspend the Catholic Clergy above referred to, threatened to hang
them? The foregoing telegram goes on to say that ninety-seven
Cores, having declared that they would pay no respect to orders
issued by the civil authorities relative to ecclesiastical matters, had
all been "temporarily suspended." Can you not imagine that this
will be taken and explained to signify that the ninety-seven Catholic
martyrs were all of them hanged by the neck, but not till they were
dead, having been cut down while yet alive, &c.t &o., as the
Protestant English miscreants under JAMES THE FIHSI served B.B.
Gur FAWKES and GARNET?
To the Scientific World.
IT seems that there is a state of oxygen gas which possesses " a
flavour of lobsters," but, unfortunately, it has the drawback of
being injurious, otherwise, in such dear times as ours, lovers of these
Crustacea might have been glad to inhale it as a substitute for their
favourite shell-fish. Now that they are so costly, cannot some
chemist discover a cheap and harmless gas which has a flavour of
oysters P
A Family Affair.
IN view of the scarcity of coals, the Gardeners' Magazine proposes
the cultivation of trees for fuel. This, doubtless, is a promising
speculation, and it may, perhaps, pay Posterity. But whose Pos-
terity_? Before planting an estate for Posterity, one would like to
be quite sure that the property would be preserved for Posterity by
the perpetuity of entail.

A DAT OF REST FOR ALL.
THE National Sunday League, under the presidency of LORD
AMBEBUSY, at the Horns Tavern, Kennington, the other day, re-
solved on sending a petition to the House of Commons for the
opening of Museums and other similar institutions on Sunday
afternoons. LOUD AJIBERIET made a suggestive remark :—
"He would yield to no one in hia desire that one day out of the seven
should be observed as a day of rest, but he did not admit it to be an absolute
necessity that every person should rest on the same day."
To every thinking and unprejudiced mind this, surely, moat
appear a very just observation. Our fellow-subjects include Jews
and Mahometans. Do they enjoy freedom of conscience when,
whilst their own religions compel them to rest, respectively, on
Friday and Saturday, our own Sabbatarian law compels them to
rest on Sunday too P Against opening Museums and Picture Galleries
on Sundays the only serious objection that can be alleged, the inter-
ference with the Sabbath of officials employed to attend in them,
would be obviated by the employment of a few supernumerary
Mussulmans or Hebrews. Both the Children of Israel and the
Votaries of Mahomet would be glad enough to be engaged in a
service that would be no hard labour for a Christian even, needing
to earn an honest penny. If diversity of creed is an evil, it is
allowed to be a necessary one in a land of liberty; then make the
beet of it. Since we have Jews and Mahometans in our midst, we
might as well utilise them, during our Sunday's rest, to their own
advantage as well as for the benefit of the Christian community.
In the same manner Secularists also might be turned to some pur-
pose, and also withheld from temptation to do worse than work, and
at the same time get to spend their time in doing about the least
possible amount of work, on Sundays.
THE SPANISH KALENDS.
WE learn from a paragraph in the Times .—
"No date is at present fixed for resuming the official inquiry before the
Police Magistrate fit Greenwich respecting the loss of the Northfttet, and it is
expected that nothing further \cttl be done until the case of the Murillo is dis-
posed of by the Spanish Government."
Considering our experience in the case of the Tornado, to say
nothing of the present state of things in Spain, this is a " long look-
out " with a vengeance!
Punch's prayer is, may the owners who are waiting; for ** the
Spanish," get their money—with deferred interest. If they do,
what swingeing damages they will get!
- Legislation for the Counter.
TEE Times remarks that our European neighbours tell us that we
must meet the Ultramontanes with "rigid counter legislation."
Has our legislation, in general, for some time past, been anything
else? The principle on which it has been mainly directed by a
Government of severe economists, who subordinate all other con-
siderations to those of'finance, is surely both counter and rigid to the
uttermost extreme.
Something Left Out.

GENTLEMEN AT LARGE.
PaomsoBS and Practitioners of Psychological Medicine. A
practical question, Gentlemen, of some importance in your line,
peems suggested by eome particulars in connection with a case of
Mysterious Disappearance, mentioned in the Post, under heading of
"The Kidnapped Solicitor," as follows, with variations merely
nominal.
"MB. STAKKISS, the solicitor, whose supposed kidnapping BO much dis-
turbed the public mind, if at present under the care of UK. DASH, of Oldport.
It does not appear, however, that MR. S. is suffering, or has been suffering,
from hallucination. Hit mind is perfectly clear and collected, and if it be
affected with any mysterious form of insanity, it can only be of that strange
kind happily little known in England, ana called by German and Russian
]-lij ficians 'wander-madness.' It is now ascertained that while MR. 8. was
writing the letters giving an account of his abduction to the " loathsome den,'
"i-'iuewhere in the East-end of London, he was pleasantly passing his time in
Southampton."
The'friends of MB. S., TV Inn the yj.ad once caught him, might as
Well havellooked, after, him. But—
"After MR. S. had been only four days with his friends, following his
return from the * loathsome den, he disappeared again on Thursday the 13th
list. This time, fortunately, his friends at once communicated with the
police, and he was traced by MR. Si ri m>Ttuni NT BBOWJC, of Oldport, to a
udging-house at Bitcbmouth. Looking in through a crack in the door, he
saw the missing solicitor tested at a table, with a bottle of sherry on either
>ide of him, a long clay pipe in his mouth, spectacles on his note, and in his
rand a nevtpsper, which be was quietly perusing. He was very carefully
dres*ed, and seemed quite at his ease."
It was subsequently found that this erratic gentleman at large
had been " making arrangements to proceed to Jersey." He seems
distinctly to have asked himself the question—
"Goosey, gooiey gander,
W hither shall I wander >"
There appears to have been a certain method in his "wander-
madness ;" for in the meanwhile, pending reference to his family :—
"The superintendent and the solicitor accidentally met in the street. The
latter knew at once the business of the former, and laid,' How on earth did
you find me out here ?'"
It is pleasant to be enabled to add that—
"Mit. 8. states that he is very glad to find himself at home once more."
Let us hope that his friends, if they rely on this statement, will
not find themselves deluded. It is also to be wished that they may
prove equal to the task of taking care of him. But now, if a case
such as his were put under professional hands, how would they
handle it? Everybody knows what an improvement has been
wrought in the treatment, once customary, of common raving, ram-
pant, roaring, dancing madness. The simply soothing system has
supplanted a regimen which, mainly consisting of bread and water,
included whipping-cheer ad libitum. There still occur oases, how-
ever, of madness, wherein it may be questioned whether, even now,
recourse might not with advantage occasionally be had to that com-
bination of lowering measures with stimulant. Perhaps, in "wan-
der-madness," of which the symptoms are mingled with the degree
of lucidity exemplified in the above instance, considerable success
might be achieved by the moderate and judicious administration of
"Tickletoby."
But there are two sides to every picture, though nobody ever looks
at the other side, except the Cataloguer at the It. A. Travellers,
glorified as heroes, brave dangers, endure privations, and sacrifice
money which at least every Philistine thinks nobody in hia senses
could. Must we not, therefore, beware of being landed in a conclusion
which would bid us prescribe "Tiokletoby" for a Livingstone?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

OOTI Infanta Buffer by the existing laws in regard
to "custody." To-night, Monday, March 24,
LORD CHELMSFORD urged a Bill empowering
Chancery, in iU discretion, to give a mother the
custody of children under sixteen; and supporting
deeds of separation, whereby bad husbands give up children to wives. All in
the right direction. We cannot pay too much respect to the interest of the
young. Maxima debetw pitero Revalenta—here pueris, though wrong, would
be more appropriate.
IB the Commons MR. CHICHESTEB FoRTKScr/E thanked MR. PLTMSOLI, for
giving him such information as had induced him to cause a vessel called the
Pargato be surveyed. She had been declared unseaworthy, and orders had
been given to prevent her going to sea.^ This is well. Touching her name, the
word recalls to Mr. Punch a most valiant and furious poem which he read in
the early days of GEORGE THE FOURTH. In this the treatment of Farga by the
British was made the subject of awful invective. He well remembers that it
began thu* :—
"0 Parga! Parga! land of many wrongs,
Land bowed beneath th* oppressor's iron rod,
Methinlu even now I hear thy dirge-like songs.
I hear and shudder. Can it be, 0 God?"
Unless Mr. Punch mistakes, Pargo, which is in Albania, held out against
ALI PASHA, and we had a good deal to do with its surrender to that tyrant.
Anybody who likes can look up the history—we shan't. We never read anything
that tells against our beloved country.
MB. GLADSTONE said that we were not going to pay the Alabama, money until
it should be due—months hence.
The gallant SIR SAMT/EL BAKER'S expedition for the purpose of putting down
Slavery in Africa, was represented as having met with misfortunes, and there
is some satisfaction in learning that the Khedive has sent some soldiers to the
aid of BAKER PASHA.
Mu. GOSCHEIT gave us the Navy Estimates. They are nearly Ten Millions,
and exceed last year's by about £340,000. But who cires about the money?
Look here. We have got twelve ships, so strong that all the rest of the nations
of the world, together, cannot produce a foroe that can fight us. In addition,
we have another splendid fleet.
So. after a short debate, the Commons voted 60,000 men and boys, and
£•2,029,000 for wages.
Some day the time may come when, in the beautiful words of the Laureate,
we shall be
"Breaking our mailed ahips, and armed towers,
Controlling, by obeying, Nature's powers,
And gathering all the fruiu of earth, and crowned with all her flowers."
Bat it is particularly certain that the time has not yet come, and anachronisms
are bad taste. So, hooray for the Denattation and her terrible sisters!
Tuesday.—A handful of slightly cheeky fanatics in Ireland call themselves
the Catholic Apostolic Christian Church. Which course
Loan RKDBSDALE called rather strong. We think it
rather weak. But there is some difficulty about their
marriages, and as it is not fair that their children, who
have nothing to do with their parents' nonsense, and will
probably repudiate it by-and-by. should be inconveni-
enced, a BUI is passing the Lords for putting matters
straight.
MR. PLIMSOLL'S book was referred to in the Upper
House, and LOUD MALMESBCRT said that MR. PLIMSOLL
had revealed aets which could only be cill-d " diabolical."
A celebrated judgment of the Home of Lords has rather
put the word out of date, but we understsjid LORD
MALMESBUBY, and cordially agree with him.
In the Commons, MR. GudCHgy gave some information
as to the stations selected for observing the Transit of
Venus. Also aboat the " method " to be employed. All
highly instructive, and particularly dull. What says
KEATS?—
*' Do not all charms fly
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?
Tnere wa« an awful ninbow—oa«e—in He»T«n.
We know her woof, her texture. She is given
In the dull catalogue of common things—
Philosophy could clip an Angel's wingi."
There was only one Transit of Venus which commends
itaolf to the lover of poetry—when she passed before
./Eneas.
"Veraque incessu pntuit Dex."
"And by her radiant walk the Q leen of Lore is known."
Drydm.
However, we dare say it may be very proper to measure
stars, and snns, and cook up Nautical Almanacks, and to
mike ourselves generally and astronomically useful.
MR. ANDERSON then proposed to carry the House from
Venus to the Currency. But the Time* says that he was
FO awfully wrong that his speech afforded a painful
illustration of the state of the representation, or there-
abouts, and we shall not go into his heresies. The
Currency question is simple enough. A Bank of England
note is a Mint Certificate. The ebb and fl >w of our
Currency in harmony with the Specie movements of the
world is as regular as that of any river. Bat any man
who suffers from wrong calculations wishes to throw
blame elsewhere. SIR Joes LUBBOCK, who knows all
about it, defended the Bank Act.
After the subject had dropped, MR. CnvDwrcic moved
for an inquiry into the Income-tax; bnt suoh a subject—
or such a speaker—was not acceptable, and there was a
Count.
Wednesday, for a wonder, gave us rather an interesting
debate, and a good party rally. The subject was not
promising. It was the Bill affsoting the Burial of
Dissenters. They are desirous to be permitted to be buried
in Church Yards, but without the service of the Church.
It is not a topic for mirth, unless we find any in the
fact that such a man as MR. DISRAELI could lead opposi-
tion to the Bill, and exert himself, in an elaborate
speech, to array all kinds of arguments against allowing
Englishmen, who had stayed away from the Church in
life, to be brought near it in death. One single real
objection had been provided against. There are vain
fools, and vulgar sceptics, who might take the opportu-
nity of a funeral to air their oratory, or to announce
their atheism, over a grave. But this Bill expressly
enacts that no person shall officiate but a minister of a
registered congregation, and that the service shall be
strictly religious. The Ministers supported the Bill, and
the Second Reading was carried by 280 to 217—majority
63. Yet a second note of resolute opposition has been
sounded.
This evening, in. respectful imitation of 3tr. Punch,
the Ministers went to dine at the Mansion House. They
m«t all the Mayors of the kingdom, whom SIR STDNET
WA'TERLOW had hospitably gathered, and the show of
robes and chains was delightful to behold. Ministers did
not distinguish themselves ranch. Ms. GLADSTONE re-
minded us of Surya in the Rejected Addresses, when
asked to mount the new theatre. In the imitation of
SOUTHET it is writ,—
"But ah, coy Surya still felt a twinjre,
Still started from hii former singe,
And to Veeshnoo replied,
In a tone rather (jmff,
'No, thank yoj, one tumble's enough.'"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. GLA USTOXE said, however, that Government had had a fall
and a recovery, and were ashamed of neither. Bat the event over-
shadowed ministerial memories, and Mil. LOWE quite scoffed at
MB. DISRAELI—who was " not there," like the shopkeeper when the
nigger got the hat from the shop, and therefore could not tell the
price of it.
The Mayors were not eloquent. The LORD MAYOR OF YORK made
"a brief speech," which the reporters did not take. "By perfect
modesty o'eroome," probably, like one of POPE'S heroes. Do you
know the Yorkshire rhyme about the Chief Magistrate of York and
his Lady?
"He is a Lord for a year and a day,
.But she u a Lady lor ever and aye."
Thus sweetly, Madam, does Mr. Punch blend with stern politics
gentle archaeology and placid poesy.
Thwtday.— LORD ENFIELD informed MB. PETER TAYLOR that we
cannot recognise the present Spanish Government, except as pro-
visional.
MR. GLA IJSTONE made a present of this evening to the independent
Members, who gave up their Motions to permit the Irish Education
Bill to come on. The night, of course, was utterly wasted, but the
PHKMJEB, as a gentleman, could do only aa he did. There were a
variety of useless discussions—one on the Park Rules (MR. A VUTON
getting decidedly the best of it, as he had to contend with men of
two extremes), one on the Rule of the Road at Sea. While a Minis-
ter was speaking, MR. CHADWICX tried to count him out. This
would have been bad taste, but that the latter wanted to enforce an
argument about keeping a House.
The Volunteers still desire an Easter Monday Review, and MR.
CABDWELL told LORD ELCHO that any arrangement for one should
be supported by the War-Office. The military authorities are very
cold about military shows. They do not see how such things inflame
the youthful mind towards soldiering. There was a song, in 1825—
"When a youngster up I grew,
Saw one day a Grand Review,
Colours flying
Set me dyin^
To embark in a life so new."
And then mark our gallant young friend's elan (not an elk) in the
hoar of battle :—
"' Charge!' our gallant leaders cry,
On like lions then we fly,
Blood and thunder!
Foes knock under:
Then hooray for a vic-to-ry!"
You don't get such poetry as that now-a-days, Madam.
Friday.—MR. CHICHESTEB FORTESCTTE gave MR. PLMSOLL the
names of the individuals who are to be the Royal Commissioners for
inquiring into the state of our Mercantile Marine. Some very good
men have been selected. Chairman, the DUKE OF SOMERSET, who
will stand no nonsense. The DUKE OF EDINBUBOH is one, and the
nation will be pleased to know this. Some practical and scientific
men are also chosen, and 1'iun-h may say, on a review of the whole,
that he has seldom noted a Committee less willing or less likely to
be humbugged.
We had rather a scene. MB. FAWCETT had an Irish University
Bill. Since he introduced it, he has altered and improved it. So
the POPE'S men, eager to smash it, contended that it was not the
same measure which he had leave to bring in. MR. GLADSTONE saw
a difficulty, and proposed that a new notice should be given. There
is little chance of the measure coming on at all, but this course
would have made that chance infinitesimal. The SPEAKER ruled
that MB. FAWCKTT had received permission to bring in such a Bill,
and that he might do so then and there. Which he did, the Con-
servatives cheering their loudest.
A Select Committee is to inquire into the working of the ridiculous
Irish Jury System. We rather envy the members. They will hear
such a lot of good stories, as will make all of them worth asking to
dinner, which is not to be invariably predicated in the case of a
Member of Parliament.

JONATHAN'S LESSON TO JOHN.

Tin: time has been folks chaffed JOIIN BRIGHT
On his itch for Americanising:
When he painted Columbia, no shadow, all light,
Effete JOHN BULL surprising,
With a babe in her arms, Young JONATHAN hight,
On pure Democracy's milk, to the might
Of an infant Giant arising.
Bat some things, perhaps, we have seen of bite,
Have left us Young JONATHAN'S model state,
On the whole, less disposed to imitate,
And less in the mood for prizing—
As the scandals and shames of the Tammany Ring,
The lobbying and log-rolling;
Corners and wire-pullers in full swing,
The votes of dead-heads polling:
The millions of dollars paid to bring
Representative rascals their papers to fling
The ballotting urns by the shoal in:
And the general confession that, tried by the test
Of character. Congress stands contest
A place whither JONATHAN'S worst, for his best
In too much force, have stole in.
But in one thing JONATHAN stands revealed
Of his cousin JOHN the master—
In raising the crops of roguery's field,
To bigger growth and faster,
Till a harvest, undreamt of once, 'twill yield
To his bold hand who the sickle may wield,
As well as the seed's broad-caster.
He '11 sink his thousands his millions to sack,
As knowing such seed brings increase in its track,
And the bigger the rogue the broader the back—
Not so much for the scourge as the plaster.
Let this effete old Europe go on
With petty robbing and reiving.
Teach, New World JONATHAN, Old World JOHN,
Thy grander style of thieving I
When he would filch a single stone,
Square miles with diamonds broad-oast sown,
Salt thou, for flats' deceiving:
Where he at his one forged flimsy would stick,
With a hundred thousand do thou the trick,
And the Bank of England's own pocket pick—
The swindlers' sublime achieving!
How short the old World of the new one falls,
So prove, to the end of the chapter;
That not only Old England's lakes and falls
By Young America s oapt are:
The jobs of thy senatorial halls,
Thy rings, thy corners, thy crises, thy calls,
In a larger tether wrapt are;
And last, not least, thy swindles rise
To a grandeur that dazzles Old-World eyes,
And Lords of industrial enterprise
Make those who, as rogues, here trapped are!

While costermongers, splashed with mud,
The product of the passing showers,
Cry Here's yer all a blowing flowers!"

8UITRESS AND SUED.
IT is very seldom that Mm is sued by Woman; except at Law.
That, however, happens not at all unfrequently; and there has
lately been rather a glut of breach of promise of marriage cases, in
more than one instance, with exacerbation of damages awarded to a
fair plain tiff for laceration of feelings occasioned by failure to secure
a husband who would have had to keep her, although at the same
time regarding her as an encumbrance, and certain to make her
miserable for life. In the reports of these pleasing trials, letters
which have passed between the parties to them are usually pub-
lished. Some of these contain verses, generally doggerel as to metre,
and for the rest nonsense. It is very remarkable that none of this
poetry is ever the composition of the plaintiff. The author of it ii
invariably the fool, that is to say the defendant, who had the folly,
first, to fall in love with an unsuitable object, and, secondly, to put
his folly on record in suitable strains. In these oases the pursuer,
as the Scotch well call her. is not only too clever to be capable of
writing such stuff as that, but likewise too cool by many degrees to
be susceptible of the sentiment which inspired it.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
At the British Museum. Important to Visitors from the Country.
Hme! "Breathes there
a man with soulsodead,
Who never to himself
has said "—I must go
to the British Museum?
I said this to myself,
and, finding that this
public institution was
10Bed on all the days
most convenient for
ray visit, I nobly sacri-
•ioed myself mi the
altar of Necessity for
the benefit of the Great
Unenlightened.
How to get there.—
The shortest and the
cheapest route is by
walking, if you know
the way from wherever
you may be. Consult
a map and your own
convenience.
The building itself
and environs. — The
mental nose of the
classically-minded will,
on entering in at the
iron gates, sniff, as it
were, a faint odour
of paganism in the
grounds. I allude to
my own mental nose.
There stood before me
the Fane of some
Heathen Deity approached by a majestic flight of steps. I felt that
I had come to worship Something or Somebody, and there were
the pigeons wandering about consequentially awaiting their pur-
chase by enthusiastic devotees, and picking up such crumbs as were
thrown to them by the students returning from mild luncheons at a
neighbouring pastrycook's.
Oa such classic ground did I feel myself, that, had I seen elderly
gentlemen in togas ascending and descending those steps, I do not
think I should have been in the least surprised: on the contrary, I
was astonished at their absence.
At the Inns of Court the Members dining in hall are obliged to
don a sort of academic gown, just to give a learned Tone to the
festivity. This custom, in togas, ought to be adopted by the autho-
rities of the British Museum; a notice could be easily stuck up over
the Porter's Lpd^e, informing the public that " Togas, gratis, must
be obtained within, without which no one will be allowed to enter
the Museum."
The nnclassically-minded could watch the proceedings from out-
side, poking their noses through the railings, and evincing the same
kind of interest as is shown daily by the crowd who watch the
sports of the Blueooat Boys, who, many old ladies believe, are the
sons of the prisoners in Newgate, condemned to wear yellow stock-
ings and cloth petticoats, and confined behind these bars, within
view of the passers-by, for no fault of their own.
I noticed that the houses in the streets leading towards this centre
of attraction seemed to have caught something of its style and cha-
racter, being more and more classical the nearer they approach the
Museum, and increasing, proportionately, in the primness of their
respectability.
The walks and grass in front of the Museum look as though
they had been lathered and shaved every morning regularly, so
clean and smug is their appearance. There are a number of vacant
pedestals, suggestive of there having been a considerable row among
the officials as to " who should have a statue." I do not know how
these things are managed, but I suppose the names of various emi-
nent statues are proposed and seconded for a Committee's election.
These meetings must be, consequently, scenes of great excitement,
requiring, to insure the success of a candidate, much preparatory
diplomacy. I can imagine a proposer, very anxious about his statue
getting in, and even going so far as to say to a probable oppositionist,
"I won't pill your statue if yon won't pill mine!"
It would be interesting on such occasions, too, to hear the objec-
tions made to the character of many of the proposed candidates.
However, this is loitering. Let us enter.
"Scenes of my childhood!" I exclaimed to myself, "oner? more
I behold you!" After many roving years, how sweet it is to come!
to a place of public entertainment where you can go in and see
everything without paying anything!"
Here, first of all, is the usual prisoner in the dock to receive your
stick or umbrella. In return you receive a medal, or an antique
coin, numbered. There is no temptation to even the most dishonest
to leave his umbrella or stick, and walk off with the coin.
The next curiosity, after this mark of respect and esteem pre-
sented to yon by the prisoner in the dock, is a board announcing
"The Christy Collection." As I had been often emphatically
assured, by those who ought to have known, that the Christy Col-
lection never, never, never will (like the Britons in " Sale, Britan-
nia ") perform out of St. James's Hall, I was obliged to look upon
this announcement as a specimen of a curious joke made by the
Committee. I fancied, as I looked warily around, that the police-
men, the catalogue sellers, the two officials in a corner, and another
vague person in a chocolate livery, were all in the sell, and were
only watching my movements, pretending, of course, to be tho-
roughly uninterested, in order that they might not lose the chance
of hearing me ask one of their party for further information about
this board, when, on my uttering the word " Christy," they would,
I "ve no doubt, have broken into a tremendous guffaw, and ex-
claimed, "0, you April fool!"
My reticence sold them. I ascended the staircase chuckling and
pluming myself, as an old bird well may. on not having been caught
with this remarkably inappropriate chaff.
The First Landing.—This is not an incidental allusion to WILLIAM
THE CONQUEROR, nor does it mean that yon. go about the British
Museum, as about Venice, in a boat. It simply means the head of
the staircase, whence you obtain a view in perspective, like what
you see in VAIT DEB Hooo's pictures, of a few rooms full of inani-
mate curiosities, the farther one presenting the terrific effect of
gigantic blackbeetles pausing in a vain attempt to swarm up a
kitchen wall.
My object, to which I have not hitherto alluded, was to see the
fossil ante-diluvian monsters, whose address is—British Museum,
North Gallery, Upper Floor.
For, I have a Theory, worthy of the Laughing Philosopher. It is
this: Geologists have omitted one period. The Oolitic, the Mesozoic,
&o., are all very well in their way, but they are inexpressive terms,
I hold, compared with what I am now about to propose for the
benefit of Science generally, and this Museum in particular. I
would include two or three " periods" in one term, viz., The Pan-
tomime Period. Why these gigantic creatures are the very model*
for Drury Lane property-room at Christmas time; and when some
of the learned have opined that no man could have been their con-
temporary, have they forgotten the men with Large Heads and
Goggle Eyes, who only appear in the Pantomime Period, the
remnant of some oral tradition of the Past. Then came the Trans-
formation Scene; then followed more gradually, in due course,
civilisation, just as the realms of Fairy Land are closed in by the
brilliantly-coloured shop-fronts of JOHX DOUGH, Baker, PIKK,
Fishmonger, and SWIPES, Publican. Oblige me by considering this
as we sit in
Room the First, which I here name The Alderman's Room, it
being apparently full of Turtle—Real and Hock. Let us digest this
first of all. The voice of the Turtle is heard in the Grove. After
such a getting up-stairs, let us sit awhile and lovingly regard a
Tremendous Turtle, of the evidently Pantomime Period, big enough
to have dined, or to have dined on, six Aldermen. Alas! an extinct
species.
LINES ON LADY DAY.
11 KKI: again is Lady Day.
I have got my rent to pay.
How the Quarters roll away!
Lidy Day is fair this year.
Wind East; hazy; mild, but queer.
Sunshine bright, though hardly clear.

Dust in March; it is a thing
Worth the ransom of a King.

Soon will puddles bring, and pools.

PROHIBITION FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
SINCE the loss of the Deceased Wife's Sister's Bill, the other day,
in the House of Lords, a considerable number of our contemporaries
have rejoiced over its rejection, and eulogised its opponents. They
have, however, omitted to notice two chief points in which the claims
of those parties to commendation are remarkable. Not any Journalist
or Reviewer has pointed out, firstly, that the Bill for legalising
marriage with the sister of a deceased wife was permissive and not
compulsory; so that it was not as though those who opposed it did
so because it threatened to make them and others of their way of
thinking liable to be obliged to marry their deceased wives' sisters
against their wills, and therefore that their opposition to it proceeded
from a purely disinterested and benevolent desire to regulate the
conduct of other people. Secondly, that the permission to contract
a marriage forbidden by the British Law, though not by that of
Nature, and not only legal in many foreign countries but customary
without any the slightest detriment to Society, would have been the
removal of an existing restriction on personal liberty ; a thing never
to be thought of by the majority, who are not aggrieved by it, so
long as it is implored only by a weak minority, and to be conceded
not until those who demand it are numerous and formidable; but
then always, of course.
EAGLE AND GOOSE.
IT seems to be a question whether the United States Government
will allow the " Three Rules " under which the Geneva Award was
given against us to the amount of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000
to bind them, prospectively, in the same sense as that in which we
consented to let it retrospectively bind us, so letting ourselves in for
payment of all that money. Bat the money is not paid yet; or, at
least, if it is not, my Lords of the Treasury, had you not better wait
before you do pay it, until you know whether or not the Yankees
mean to agree that what has been sauce for the British Goose shall,
in like circumstances, be held and taken to be condiment also for the
American Eagle?

COAL AND CHAMPAGNE.
MR. DICKEWSOIT, Her Majesty's Inspector of Mine* for East and South
Lancashire, in his evidence before the Coal Committee, in answer to a question
by MB. MUHDELLA, stated that he had heard that the colliers do" indulge in
the luxury of drinking champagne," and believed that it does happen occasion-
ally. Some time ago newspapers announced that an American chemist had
succeeded in making champagne out of petroleum. He very likely did contrive
to make an effervescing fluid, worthy at least of the name of " fizz," which ia
said to be that under which the colliers drink something which goes down for
the above-mentioned wine. There is no petroleum in our British coal-mines,
otherwise perhaps champagne might be cheaper for those striking sons of toil,
who would then occasionally "strike ile" in addition to their strikes for
higher wagns.
If the "fizz " which the colliers sometimes indulge in were really genuine
PESIKK JOUBT, or MO£T and CHANDOK, it might be apprehended that there
would soon occur a rise in the price of champagne as well as in that of coals;
but rhubarb is cheap, at whatever price " fizz " may be vended to its probably
indiscriminate consumers. It is sad to think that those poor men are very
likely done when they spend half-a-guinea out of their hard earnings on stuff'
that may not be worth sixpence a bottle. Yet the painful suspicion which one
cannot help feeling on that point may possibly be unfounded, and the beverage
which has replaced beer among those good fellows may really be the genuine
growth of the French wine-growing districts, premier cru._ If that is go, well.
To a species of malt liquor the denomination of Cooper is applied. In like
manner, let that product of the juice of the grape Which has hitherto borne
the title of Champagne be called Collier.

CULTURE OF NATIVE WORTH.
A JOURNAL of Caen (Calvados) announces the formation
of oyster-beds, on an extensive scale, at Coursenilles and
Marennes. The oysters laid down in them are natives of
Portugal, having been imported from the mouth of the
Tagus to the number of some hundred thousand. An
English contemporary reproduces this information under
the title of "Oyster Culture." This is a branch of
Culture which, to every man of taste, must commend
itself especially, and, barring idiosyncrasy in that
respect, is one of which the prosecution cannot but be
highly satisfactory to MB. MATTHEW ARNOLD. It may
be remarked that Oyster Culture necessarily effects a
development of Sweetness, although the relation of the
mollusc to mud altogether preventa it from being
accompanied by that of Light.

STBIKE FOR LOWER WAGES.
THE KVBL OF Sn AFTEMICRY thinks he has discovered the real way
of effectually promoting temperance amongst the Working Classes.
Opening a Bazaar,
the other day, in
aid of some Baptist
schools, his Lord-
ship made a speech,
wherein, referring
to those classes, he
observed that :—
"There never was a
time when effort* in
support of temperance
were more needed. He
could not help think-
ing that the state of
thing! had become 10
formidable that one
hardly knew how best
to cope with it."
A Permissive Pro-
hibitory,, or any
other Liquor Law,
does not appear to
have commended it-
self to the Noble
Lard's judgment as
a panacea for the
excess which he as-
cribes to the Work-
ing Man. No; but—
"Of one lljiii(f, how-
ever, he wa> sure, and
it w:ii> that no effectual
good could be done
nut.I wo had planted
in the minds of the
people a spirit of self-
control."
The spirit once
planted could be
watered if neces-
sary; and the result,
of course, would not
be grog. But how
to plant it? Hear;
and mind that it is
LOBD SHAFTES^UBY
who epeaks, and nut
a cynical buffoon :—
"What had been the
i • - i.U of that enormous
increaaeof wages which
hud lately taken place
in nearly every class of
Working Men? He
lemembered, thirty
jears ago, there was a
Committee appointed
by the House of Com-
mons in connection
with the principle of
combination, and SIR
ARCHIBALD ALISON
laid it down as a truth
that high wages were
the curse of the Work-
ing Men. He (l.oiin
SHAPTESBDEY) could
not help thinking the
statement a correct
one."
To plant the spirit
of self-control, then,
in the minds of the
People (with a great
P, as, by a mistake,
it is not spelt in the above-quoted report), the way would obviously
be, if LOBD SHAFTES BPBY is right as to both the fact and cause of
their intemperance, simply to lower their wages to the requisite
standard. For, as his Lordship said,—
"Of course, where economy and prudence were practiicd, the condition of
the Working Han should be improred by higher wages; bat there were
recklessness and improridence. The sudden increase of money had been pro -
duotire of the greatest potable mischief, and so long as these habit* continued
he could not but think that an increase of wages was • positive infliction to
the Working Man, nil wife, and his children."

in respect of so-

their actual case.

that drunkenness is

They are both the
one and the other
enthusiastic philan-
thropists, whose
fears are fathers to
their thoughts. The
Working Classes,
it is surely not too
much to say, spend
every little increase
of wages they obtain
by their harmless
strikes chiefly in the
education of their
children, and in the
purchase of the ap-
pliances needful to
make home happy.
If they are at all
extravagant is it
not in books, and
in the dress which
some of them are a
little too apt to
lavish on their

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN OLD FOGY TO MR. PUNCH.

YES, fifty years ago, dear friend, I was
younger than I am now. It is a fact, and
that fact was borne in upon me on the last
night on which MR. CHATTEBTO_N gave us
the Cataract of the Ganges, originally pro-
duced by his predecessor, MB. ELUSION.
It boots not to say what induced me to
visit Drury Lane Theatre on that night.
Perhaps I merely wished to please my nieces, JESSIE and MABIA. Perhaps I wished to escape
a tedious friend who had menaced me with a call that evening. Perhaps I only wished to be
able to say that I had Been a piece twice, with an interval of fifty years between the perform-
ances. 'Tis no matter. I went to the play.
I think the revival was a mistake, but I am an elderly fellow, and I should probably say
that of any revival. > I fancy, however, that neither the story nor the structure of the old
melodrama suited a modern audience, and
that what were gorgeous splendours in
ELUSION'S days are now but the ordinary
accessaries of a show. Still, there was a
great deal of glitter and colour.
But when 1 got home, and the girls had
had their soda-water, and I had been left
to mine (slightly fortified), I dreamed a
dream. I beheld myself in my gay and
graceful youth, as I appeared reading the
playbill, on my visit to the theatre to see
ELLISTON'S piece. With the aid of a
talented young friend, I have sketched
myself as I sat in my chair the other night,
and as I looked in 1823. Accept the work.
"Look on this picture and on that." I do
not know what moral to append. People do
get old, if they live long enough, and old
men do not dress as they did when boys. I
think the garb of our young fellows, no w-
a-days, much more becoming than was
mine in '23, and they will agree with me.
But let them remember that, if they live,
they will be Old Fogies in 1923; and let
them believe that the Old Fogies of the
present day have some memories of an
Arcadia that was not to be despised. '' We
have heard the chimes at midnight."
Yours, uncomplainingly,
Vixi.
P.8.— JESSIE and MABIA declare that no
girl of any day could have made herself such
a fright as the above. I see no fright; but
I see what I saw and loved fifty years ago.
Reparation at Rome.
A SOLEMN- religious service was performed
the other day at St. Peter's, " in reparation,"
says the Osiervatore Romano, " of the exe-
crable blasphemies," which certain journals
continually " vomit out." Ostensibly for a
charitable purpose, two lectures on the sun
and other celestial bodies were lately de-
livered in the great hall of the Cancellaria
Palace by the learned Jesuit astronomer,
FATHER SKCCII i. Were these discourses in-
tended "in reparation" of the "execrable"
treatment to which the Holy See, in error,
subjected GALILEO?
THE THAMES AND THE NILE.
SIR J. KABSLAKE, at the Mansion House, proposing the health of
the LOBD MATOB, as host to the University Boat Crews, gave his
Lordship a chance :—
"Thanking the LOBD MATOB on the part of the assembled guests for his
magnificent hospitality, he said he had taken a wise course in inviting the
Oxford and Cambridge crews, for he had kept them out of the 'Wicked
World,' and far away from the ' Happy Land.'
Of course SIB SIDNEY WATEBLOW was equal to the occasion :—
ihey would return some future day."
The next Lord Mayor may safely try the experiment by inviting
them. Never could have been an inclination to return to the flesh-
pots of ^Egypt experienced more strongly than by the guests who
partook* of those served up at the Egyptian Hall of the Mansion
House.
PUMPS F. PILLAR-POSTS.
LONDON letter-writers ought to be obliged to MB. W. J. WILSON
for warning them, through the Times, of a risk to their letters, we
will be bound to say, they never thought of :—
"Scattered over the parish of St. Marylebone," writes MR. WILSOX,
"and probably in other parts of the metropolis, there are several old-
fashioned iron pumps, the handles of which have been removed, leaving a
vertical ilit which looks much like the opening of a letter-box. In these
pumps many persons place their letters. As it is not impossible that letters
of value or importance may bo lying in some of these hiding-places, surely it
is expedient that a search be at once made, and that sometniug be done to
prevent such mistakes in future:"
All Mr. Punch can say is, that any one so depositing letters mutt
be even a greater pump than that which he thus turns into a pillar-
post. But the writer suggests that the Post Office ought to shut up
the pumps. What next? Is the Post Office responsible for acts of
idiots who can't tell an old pump from a new pillar? We don't
want to be too much Governed. "Folly is but the speck in
Freedom's eye."
HYPERCRITICISM.
A DISCEBNING article in the Saturday Review, on LOBD OBMA-
THWAITE'S Lesions of the French Revolution, contains the following
remark relative to the author of that considerable performance :—
"LOBD ORMATHWAITB, for example, is a believer in the British Constitu-
tion, and for the good old-fashioned reason that it is an admirable mixture of
democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. He regards a Conatitution, that is, as
a kind of chemical product, which should be judiciously compounded by a
legislator, as a chemist makes gunpowder out of saltpetre, sulphur, and
charcoal."
To make the simile perfect, however, gunpowder should, in point
of fact, be a compound of substances chemically combined, as in the
various fulminates, instead of being a merely mechanical mixture.
But, as an illustration, it will do well enough for all that; only an
ass might observe that, whereas gunpowder is made to the end that
it may go off, the British Constitution can have been compounded
only on purpose to go on.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
VESTSO talk on Mon-
day, March 31, in
the House of Lords,
about the Devasta-
tion. My Lords of
the Admiralty do
not distrust her, hut
, they consider her an
• experimental vessel,
so the Comptroller
of the Navy is to
take a passage in
her on her trial trip.
, The DUKE OF SO-
MERSET urged that
if she went the way
of the Captain no
one would know who
was responsible, to
which LOBD HALI-
FAX replied that the
Admiralty would be
responsible. This
must be entirely
comforting to the
Comptroller of the
Navy. We suggest
that the Admiralty
may just as well go
in her also, for if
they stay at home
and anything hap-
pens to her—
"Their lives will not
be made so pleasant
to them,
That they, my Lordi,
will greatly care to
lire."
In the Commons
we had long debate
on the Bill for vest-
ing in three Commis-
sioners authority
over all the Rail-
ways and Canals.
ME. FIELDEIT did
not consider such a
measure necessary,
as the railways kill
very few passengers, considering the vast number they carry. But there are
other things beside accidents to be considered. The railways charge what they
like, and make their own arrangements, and quarrel among themselves, regard-
less of public convenience. When public complaint is raised, the Companies
never condescend to reply, and on the whole the gigantic anomalous monopoly
will be all the better for regulation. It was only the other day that Mr. Punch
wanted to go to the Crystal Palace, and when he got to the High Level station,
Victoria, he found that there was no train for an hour and forty-two minutes. Do
we live in the nineteenth century, Madam? Are we Britons? Are we descend-
ants of the men who won Cressy and Agincourt; who wrested Magna Charta
from the tyrant John, who hurled from his forfeited throne the tyrant JAMES?
We believe these are the questions which it is proper to ask when anything
displeases us?
Tuesday.—The Judicature Bill was sent to a Select Committee, on the ground
that it is too full of detail to be dealt with by the House. Everybody was very
polite to LORD SELBORME, and LORD SKLBORNE was very polite to everybody—
but we hope business is meant.
"Graced as he is with all the power of words,
So known, eo honoured in the House of Lord*,
Persuasion tips his tongue whene'er he talk*.
And he haa chambers in the King's Bench Walks,"
(or at least he might have if he liked), his Lordship will And he needs all he
knows to get the Judicature Bill through both Houses this Session.
LOBD JOHN MAHHT^RS presented a petition from some Leicestershire gabies in
favour of "the Claimant." Let'em go and thatch Groby pool with pancakes,
as their idiotic proverb says.
In reference to the Budget (there's a splendid surplus, Madam, and Drink
has produced a very large part of it—MR. LOWE will probably say, with the wild
fellow in Sarnaby Radge, "I drink to the drink "), MR. GLADSTONE stated that
no resolution would be proposed on the following Monday, binding the House
with reference to the future taxation of the year. This, Madam, was held to
mean a good deal.

. "Folks are not always generous and well-bred,
But GLADSTONE is—meant truly what he said."
Ma. FOWLER moved that the Indian Budget should be
taken early in the Session, so that it might be discussed.
An amendment, referring the matter to the Select Com-
mittee on India, was carried by 130 to 89. Madam, yon
have much general information. Who was " the base
Indian that threw a pearl away Richer than all his
tribe?" (Othello, Act v. s. 2.)
A Defamation Bill was thrown out, bat never mind,
Madam, Mr. Punch intends still to
"Bear without abuse
The grand old name of gentleman,
Defamed by every charlatan,
And soiled with all ignoble use."
By the way, dear Madam, we have heard of a blunder
that is as good as wit. A lady of the Malaprop order
threatened to summon another lady for Definition of
Character. Isn't it good?
W'ednetday.—tas.. CHARLEY promoted a Bill with a
meritorious object. This was to afford certain new pro-
tection to young persons of the genfler sex. There was
snme rather sharp debate, but the Bill was read a Second
Time.
There is a Bill to restrict private slaughter-houses. It
is sturdily opposed, on feeble grounds, but (a spiteful
person would say and therefore) ME. BRUCE joined in the
opposition, but conceded a Committee on the Meat Supply
of London.
An Irish Member raised a point of form in order to
hinder MB. FAWCBTT from bringing in his Dublin Uni-
versity Bill, and for that time succeeded.
Thursday.—In the Commons, a petition like that
already mentioned (about CLAIMANT-CASTRO) was pre-
sented from some ninnies of Hampshire and Dorsetshire.
We inform the Dorset folk that we believe the CLAIM-
ANT to be as much akin to the TICHBORNES as Lenson
Hill is to Pilsen-Pin; and the Hampshire folk, that
Manners makes a man, quo' WILLIAM OF WICKHAM,
and that they would show better manners in not insulting
their QUEEN'S Government by implying that it means to
convict CASTRO in any unfair manner.
It was an important matter, and worthy to be men-
tioned in the Imperial Parliament, that a char-woman
who took away some broken meat from LORD Cin\N-
VILLB'S, and was given in charge for taking it in one of
his Lordship's napkins, which she pawned, was dis-
charged, larcenous intent not being proved, but she was
declared not to be without blame. Question was asked
by the HONOURABLE WILLIAM LOWTHER, Conservative
member for Westmoreland, and answered by the RIGHT
HONOURABLE HENRY AUSTIN BRUCE, Her Majesty's
Secretary of State for the Home Department.
But then we had some fun. The other night the
Pall Mall Gazette wrote as followeth :—
"The scene of Friday night showed how lamentably
MR. GLADSTONE'S sense of propriety has been perverted, by his
fretful irritation at a rebuke the more painful became it was
felt to be merited. It was not surprising that the Irish Ultra-
montane Members should resort to every quibble discoverable in
the technicalities of the law of Parliament to delay or defeat a
measure like UK. FAWCBTT'S, which cuts the ground from under
their venal agitations, and their traffic in noisy disloyalty."
This is mildness itself compared to the furious on-
slaughts of the Papal organs in Ireland against the
supporters of the Education Bill; but then, as no person
in his proper senses cares a farthing for any amount of
howling by the Irish Papal press, whereas a journal of
culture hits hard, we cannot complain that the POPE'S
men are incensed. "Ultramontane," Madam, means
"beyond the mountains;" that is, the Alps, and is a
word applied to the men who take the priestly'view of
Papal authority.
MR. MUNSTER, a very young Member, who had that
day taken his seat after prolonged travel, moved that the
P.M.G. had been guilty of breach of privilege.
MR. DISRAELI made mirth of the proposal, and said
that, before attacking the liberty of the Press, he should
like some more information. Were there any Ultra-
montane Members in the House, and who were they''
But your Irishmen of the present day have small sense
of humour, and MR. DISRAELI caused them to wax
angrier. So the ATTORNEY-GEITERAL had to contend

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
that the newspaper had not attacked the l/ltramontanes in their
Parliamentary capacity. He did not make much of this plea,
however, for an obvious reason: and, after some more excite-
ment, Ma. GLADSTONE was obliged to put an end to the nonsense
by appealing to the Mover, "whose experience in Parliament
had not been long accumulating," not to go to a vote. The charge,
of course, was unfounded, — let the consciousness of that fact
be enough. SIR JOHN EBMOBDE (one of the most sensible and
gentlemanly of the Irish Members) described this as a handsome
statement, and thus flung oil on the troubled Hibernian waters.
The Motion was withdrawn. We don't think the worse of a young
Member for being a little passionate, but at school we were taught
that passion should take advice. The 1'ull Mall Gazette subse-
quently stated that its language had been too ungracious, that by
Venal it had not meant pecuniarily corrupt, but that—
"Nothing mutt be taken to imply that we think the Ultramontane Members
have not retorted to parliamentary quibbling for the defeat of MK. FAWCETT'S
Bill; or that there is no noi>y disloyalty in Ireland to influence elections; or
that the votes of certain Members are not at the disposal of a prieatly party
whose one aim is not the good of the State, but the prosperity of their own
Church. This we do not think, and can make no apology for saying so."
* MB. FAWCETT did bring in his Dublin Bill. It is limited to the
doing away with the Test that excludes the Catholic, and we are
curious to know on what ground the Catholics will oppose it.
Perhaps because it does not impose a Test to exclude the Protestant.
Friday.—My Lords rose for their Easter holidays.
SIB GKOKGK JENKINSON, in a lucid manner, pointed out the great
advantage that would arise from a railway between the Mediterra-
nean and the head of the Persian Gulf. Persicos odi, puer,
apparatus, replied MB. LOWE, If we interfere to promote the
object, Turkey will infallibly let us in for the cost, and, said
MB. DODSON, the making seven hundred miles of rail through a
howling wilderness, infested by howling savages, is not precisely a
joke. Yet we shall probably see such a project accomplished. The
House was Counted Out while SEBJEANT SIMON was recounting the
sufferings of MB. JENCXEN, who was atrociously ill-treated by some
wretches in Spain, and to whom the Spanish Government will make
no compensation. Ha! there teas a time when the mention of
JENCXEN'S, or, rather. JENKINS' Ears, roused a flame not easily ex-
tinguished. But the House, in 1873, had no Ears for
;MATRIMONIAL MIXED PUNCH.
UHDEB the heading of "Mixed Marriages," in a letter to the
Times, " ONE MUCH INTERESTED" inquires what remedy is to be
found for a grievance consisting in the refusal of Unman Catholic
Priests, by order of ABCEBISHOP MASSING, to celebrate mixed mar-
riages between couples who decline promising to be contented with
the Roman Catholic ceremony, and not have the Protestant per-
formed either before it or after. The remedy is simply to do either
without the Roman Catholic marriage or without the Protestant,
whichever the parties intending to marry value the less. People
who do not hesitate to mix their marriages, can hardly be more
particular about their denomination than people accustomed to mix
their liquors are about their drink. For the former, one religious
marriage ceremony ought to be as good as another, if only legal. They
have no right to complain of DB. MANNING. He has professional
reasons for the office he has given his priests as to officiating at
weddings. This is a land of at least religious liberty, and he and
his clergy are a free hierarchy in a so far free State. Any other
Dissenting minister than the titular Archbishop would be quite as
much within his right if he were to take the same line in regard to
mixed marriages as that ecclesiastic's, and risk the result of a
secession from Ebenf zer.
In the meantime, MB. MIAU, and the rest of you, beloved repre-
sentatives and constituents of the said Ebenezer, and also of Little
Bethel, Salem, and so on, must you not admit that the respectable
British Public at large is furnished with at least one great conveni-
ence in an Establishment whose Parsons are bound to marry all
comers provided there be no just cause or impediment why those
persons should not be joined together in holy matrimony? As far
as those reverend gentlemen are concerned, you are entirely at
liberty to mix your marriages as much as ever you please, and as
many of you are blessed with pretty daughters, and, not a few,
moreover, have something to settle on them, it may be as well to add
that there are, doubtless, many eligible young Churchmen who would
gladly afford you plenty of opportunities of enjoying your blessed
freedom in that particular.

THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.

Mr DEAB MB. EOBIN-
so>T BBOWN,
You gentlemen
(as you call your-
selves) are always
making fun or say ing
druadfid things of us
poor English Udits,
because, you say, we
don't know how to
dress ourselves be-
comingly and pret-
tily. Our taste is
hideously vulgar,
you tell us, in such
matters; and even
gallant Mr.^ Punch
is sometimes impolite
enough to make a
funny picture just to show what frights we look. Then you bid us
take a lesson from our friends across the Channel, for you say that
Frenchwomen are models of good judgment in the matter of their
raiment. Well, c'Stait autrefois peut-etre; but they have changed
all that, I fancy, since the EMPBESS left them. At. any rate, see
what a writer says now of the Judgment of Paris in its fashionable
costume:—
"The polychrome cacophony of a fashionable Paris salon is intolerable to
an educated eye. Yellows, pinks, blues, purples, sea-greens, Metternich-
greens, gooseberry-purples (pie), and other equally decided hues jar and
wrangle like an assembly of viragoes."
Have politics, I wonder, any influence on the fashions? May the
polychrome cacophony now current in French drawing-rooms be
regarded as resulting from the varied party-colours displayed in the
Assembly Y Can the jarring and the wrangling of the horribly dis-
cordant hues in Paris evening dresses be occasioned by the jarring
and the wrangling at Versailles?
Leaving you in your own profundity of wisdom to solve these
knotty problems. I would ask what MBS. BBOWN thinks of this
further sample of French taste :—
"Formerly it was considered not the thing to combine the plumage of an
ostricb, the products of a greenhouse, and the contents of a jeweller's shop in
the same head. Any belle Parisunne disposed to make such a display, may
now indulge her fancy without the risk of being laughed at."
There, Sir! Now you have your models of good taste all com-
plete. Now you may behold your beautiful French ladies in all their
native loveliness and elegance of costume: their sea-green skirts,
with yellow bows, pink sashes, and gooseberry-purple paniers, and
their pyramids of ostrich plumes and primroses, and peonies perhaps,
and pearls, and emeralds, and rubies, and cornelians on their heads.
And I trust that, with this pretty little picture fresh before your
mental eyes, you will spare poor English ladies from both your
scathing sarcasm and your scarifying wit.
With my best love to dear MBS. BBOWJJ, believe me
Yours sincerely,
JULIANA JONES.

That more in drink, than wealth or work, JOHIT BULL may boast

Of sorrow, sin, and suffering—whioh have their surplus, too.
THE POLICE ON A NEW FOOTING.
ALARMISTS we are not, and would not write a word to frighten a
oat, if we could help it, and much less an old lady. Still we cannot
help remarking that burglaries of late have been frequent in the
suburbs, and pupils of Sill Sikes have broken the peace of even
Kensington. It is small fault of the police if the thieves have not
been caught: for how can a policeman, heavy-booted as he is,
expect to catch a nimble robber, whose business is to run at the
slightest sound of danger P The tramp of the Bobbeian boots may
readily be recognised full half a mile away; and Sill Sikes has
ample time to pat his crowbar in his pocket, and vanish round the
corner, ere the Peeler, pede claudo, can manage to come up to him.
The heavy boots are, no doubt, useful in their way; for instance,
say for kicking to the station a ruffianly wife-beater. Still we can- j
not help opining it would add to the safety of our streets, if a Light
Brigade of Bjbbies were established for night service, and furnished
with goloshes.
"Sing, Birdie, Sing!"
A YOUNG Lady Correspondent suggests that under the "Wild Birds'
Act the poor dear blackbird* and thrushes are protected. Nobody
must kill a robia. Anybody may kill a blackbird. Not so, if he is
stealing our cherries, for then he is a robbin'. Very good., dear.
We hope ALFRED thinks yon as clever as we do.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
A further report on the British Museum, from Birds to Beetles.
E enter the Zoologi-
cal Department.—
After regretfully
quitting the Real
and Mock Turtle
Room, filled with
specimens of the
Great Aldermanic
Period, when these
monsters crawled
about over the face
of the earth label-
led "This Day at
1 o'clock," and
when even the very
mud on the banks
was mainly com-
fsed of green fat,
strolled into the
Zoological Depart-
ment, with a view
to making the ac-
quaintance of The
American Oriole,
The Esculent Swal-
low, and the crafty
bird of the same
species, which makes
a sham entrance on the side of its nest in order to deceive its ]
creditors. The name of this last is the San Geronimo Swallow : in ,
English the Jeremy Diddler Swallow. The Tailor-bird is also!
exhibited, with, of course, his little bill. I have no doubt he is
occasionally much bothered by the San Geronimo's devices.
The Rooms are dangerous to such as walk unevenly, or with a
rolling gait, on account of the glass cases built up against the walls,
and the islands of more glass oases, in the midst of channels
requiring careful navigation.
The guardian of this department has, I noticed, a martial bearing,
and marches np and down shouldering what appeared to me to be a
billiard cue, as though he were playing at soldiers. "Perhaps," I
said to myself, "he is playing at soldiers. And why not? It is a
harmless recreation, and he must otherwise find lire here a trine
monotonous among the Reptiles, the Batrachia, and the Radiated
Animals."
I came npon him five times daring the morning, and he was still
marching about with the billiard cue. A happy and placid exist-
ence, all among the stuffed exotics, with plenty of food for th«
imagination out of meal-times, and full liberty to fancy himself
whatever he pleases as long as he doesn't break any of the glass
cases with that billiard cue. I thought once that I would ask him a
question suggested by the collections; it was this, "Why is a Tor-
toise like a Bee?" I was prepared with the answer; something about
both making combs. On consideration, I was afraid this would
ruffle his perfect serenity, induce melancholy, and cause him to be
discontented with his lot; so I kept it to myself, and smiling upon
him benignly (when his back was turned), murmured, " Play on at
soldiers, I would not disturb thee for the world. Right about face!
March! Farewell, brave soldier!" and then I betook myself to the
Toads, the Frogs, the Efts, and the Horned Toads of Brazil.
What would the unlearned in such matters make of the " Siren of
Carolina ?," It sounds like the name of a black Soprano. The name
is an attraction. I mean, were your Representative informed, by
an excited person, that by going at once to the British Museum, he
could, for nothing, see "The Siren of Carolina," he would jump at
the offer, and run all the way there to catch her before she left. But,
stay! Impetuous Header, pause! Friends at a distance will please
accept the following intimation, and save themselves some anxiety
and trouble:—
The Siren of Carolina is a sort of an eel with front legs. That's
all. Like a Soprano, however, it is gifted with lungs, and, like a
nigger in the " Christy Collection," it has "gills."
The humour of the nomenclature is really immense, and the com-
pilers of the Guide to the British Museum must have had many a
mirthful hour, after dinner, when making np their book in anticipa-
tion of the series of glorious sells which they were concocting for
the public.
The Siren, above-mentioned, is not a bad one in its way. It is,
perhaps, outdone by the Salamander of Japan. Now, Sirs, I consti-
tute myself a Committee of Inquiry, and I call into court before me,
four skilled witnesses, MR. E. L. BLANCHABD, who has written the
Drury Lane Pantomimes for any number of years past; Ma. DYK-
WVNKvN, who makes the masks; MR. BEVEBLEY, who paints the
scenes; and MR. CHATTERTON, who is a specially Beneficent Provi-
dence to the Renters, and a recognised caterer for Christmas, and I
ask them, singulatim, " What, Sir, would be your idea of a Sala-
mander of Japan?"
What would they individually and collectively answer? Why,
that he was the very fellow for the opening of a Pantomime; that
he might be trusted with some good lines to say; that he would be
dressed in red. with tinsel on his eyelids and spangles all over him ,
that he would be attended by the Sprites Flame, Firefly, Snap-
dragon, attired in costumes stitched with gun-cotton, and accom-
panied by Guards armed with Lucifer Matches warranted to strike
on every one's box but their own; that his Palace would be in the
Glowing Caverns of the Fiery Phlegethon; and that throughout the
first scenes this Salamander of Japan would be the patron of the
savage old Tycoon who wished to part the pair of Japanese Lovers
whom his hereditary antagonist. The Fairy of the Flowing Foun-
tain would of course protect. And the public, one and all, would,
hearing this description, cry aloud, "Hear! Hear!! Hear 1! I Yes.
That's the Salamander of Japan!"
And what is it at the British Museum? Why, an amphibious
animal, to whom the sight of a fire would be instantaneous death.
Were any respectable Manager to attempt to palm this creature off
on the public ai a Salamander in a Christmas Pantomime, my four
witnesses, above-mentioned, agree with me that such an imposition
would end in the benches being torn up, the Manager called for and
pelted, and, in fact, and literally, it would be an effect that would
"bring down the House."
Room 2.—On tables 7 and 8 are laid out the Sea Pancakes.
Whence this division might be termed the Shrove Tuesday Room.
The Guide-Book says of these Pancakes that they are "so de-
pressed" I should think so, being dried np, and stuck in a
glass-case. Why, to look at them, without even a fossil lemon and
sugar, and to think of a fossilised indigestion, and how well ordered
was everything for the "Capacious Mouth" in the Aldermanic
Period of the world's existence, is enough to make one melancholy.
The Catalogue (it is just to finish the quotation) continues—" S>
depressed that there scarcely appears to be any room for their inter-
nal organs." And on this I must remark, that it is a pity to see
British Museum Cataloguists become, by their occupation, so narrow-
minded as to reduce everything in creation to their own notion of
arrangement. Because the Museum is divided into rooms, is that
any reason for a wretched Sea Pancake to be so divided? Why
should a Sea Pancake have a room for an organ inside it? Or rooms
for organs? Could they prove the poor depressed creature to have
been a Musical Sea Pancake, there would have been some exouse for
their remark. I cannot quit this department without drawing
attention to the varieties of beetles from South America, some of
them being nearly as big as lobsters, and as vicious-looking as a
villain of the deepest dye in a melo-drama. The kitchen of a South
American house must be a pleasant sight at twelve o'clock at night
for the master of the house, who, returning home late with a latch-
key, and not liking to arouse the servants, descends to the basement
to see what there may be cold for supper, and to tap the beer. The
Domestic Black Beetle "in his thousands" is quite an agreeable
companion compared with the "Gigantic Gjliath," and the horned
genera of this species. Goliath I see, however, is a native of Africa,
where I trust some woolly-headed DAVID may soon stamp him out.
Seeing these beetles, I am very grateful for being an Englishman.
Beadledom is preferable to Beetledom. Brazil, I observe, is a great
place for beetles, or, I should say, a place for great beetles.
Happy Thought.—Don't go to Brazil.
The Museum is not done in a day, nor is an account of it polished
off in one number. I will conclude my visit next week.
In the evening I refreshed myself with Tricoche ct Cacolet at the
New Royalty. Rither strong: but the ladies laughed. And so, as
the poet says But I have not time to find out which poet, or
what he says; and so I am for ever
"Arnnt, pendant, et apres,"
TOT/R REPRESENTATIVE.
The Wednesday Fops.
Os Wednesday evening, during the season, there is generally a
concert, besides other music, going on. On Wednesdays, also, the
House of Commons is usually engaged in discussing a liquor law,
or some other preposterous measure, proposed by an honourable
fanatic. Shouts of " Sing!" are sometimes heard on these occasions,
but nobody attempts to, and thus the harmony of the evening is
undisturbed. Though quavers are absent from Wednesday's debate,
the attention of the House is so often devoted to a crotchet, that
Wednesday might as well be called Crotchet Day in the House of
Commons.

APRIL THE FIRST.
A Fragment. Showing how All Fools' Day teas solemnly kept by
MASTERS TOMMY MKKTON and HABBY SAHBFOBD in the house of
their beloved Tutor, Ma. BARLOW.
AT six o'clock in the morning of April the First, TOMMY and
HABBY rapped loudly at the door of their beloved Tutor's bedroom,
which they were unable to open, owing to MR. BARLOW having taken
the precaution, overnight, of turning the key on the inside.
He was dreaming of an auction, whereat he wag engaged in bidding
for a brass-plate with his name on it, when, with the third blow of
the hammer, he awoke to the consciousness of his being summoned
by a knocking which was now repeated with increased violence.
"How strange," murmured MR. BARLOW, drowsily, to himself,
"are auricular delusions!" And he was about to give himself up,
once more, to slumber, when a terrific blow, severely trying the
strength of the panels, caused him to sit upright in bed, and demand
the reason for such an unwonted display of energy.
"I protest, Sir," said MASTER TOMMY from outside, while HABRY
could scarcely restrain the exuberance of his mirth by stuffing a
pocket-handkerchief into his mouth, "I protest, Sir, that 1 would
rather have died than that you should have been disturbed in your
repose, which, as you have often taught us, is so necessary alike to
the health both of mind and body. And, indeed. I would not now
call upon you to leave your warm and comfortable couch, but that
my father"
"Who," thought Ms. BARLOW to himself, "is a very wealthy
man."
"is here," continued TOMMY, "and most anxious to see you
on business of the very last importance. He is now sitting in the
library with a cheque-book before him, and says that if yon are
unable to join him forthwith, the loss will be, he regrets to say,
yours, as he must quit this house within the next two minutes."
"Tell your honoured parent, my dear TOMMY," exclaimed
MR. BARLOW, "that he shall not be delayed one instant longer than
is absolutely necessary for my compliance with the ordinary require-
ments of that society of which he is so admirable an ornament"
So saying, he stepped from his bed, and, in less than one minute
and a half, was descending the stairs to the library, the door of
which was slightly ajar.
Though not yet entirely in command of all his senses, MR. BARLOW
was careful to press his hair down tidily with both hands, rub his
eyes, and cause his features to assume that benign smile which so
well became him.
These preliminaries being settled, he addressed himself in a hearty
tone to ME. MERTON, whom he supposed to be within, previous to
pushing open the door.
"My dear MR. MERTON "began the beloved tutor of TOMMY and
HARKY, as he entered the room, when, suddenly, the contents of a
pail of cold water, craftily suspended by hooks, and balanced
between the cornice of the door-post and the top of the door, were,
by the movement of the latter, emptied on MR. BARLOW'S head,
with such force as to deprive him for a while of breath, and to
render him unable to ascertain clearly what was before him.
On partially recovering from the shook, he saw what appeared to
him to be a boy standing by the table; and entertaining no doubt
but that he had been the object of some innocent frolic on the part
of his fond pupils, he rushed forward, and grasped the boy by the
collar, who, offering no resistance, fell to the ground, carrying along
with him MR. BARLOW, whose feet, having caught in the centre of a
system of strings, which were attached to every article of more or
less weight and value in the room, brought to the ground all the
crockery, the glasses, the books, the china ornaments, the ink-
bottles, the water-jars, the inkstands, and some recently framed
pictures, with one overwhelming and appalling crash.
Scarcely had MB. BARLOW discovered that the boy he was
belabouring was only an ingeniously contrived dummy, before the
voices of his two beloved pupils were heard at the door.

At this moment, however, the Butler, who having been' startled
by the prodigious noise, had approached quietly, took the young
gentlemen gently but firmly l>v the collar, and before they were
aware of his intention brought them into the room.
MB. BABLOW, having slowly risen, BOW looked the door; and while
proceeding to open a safe labelled, in large characters, BircKt
Sweets and Sugar Canes, thus addressed his young friends:—
"The Festival of ' All Fools' Day ' is celebrated, or, to keep pace
with the humour of the day, I should say sc/7-ebrated, in various
ways."

"Youth must have its fling, and its whaok." Here MB. BARLOW
produced a brand new birch, tied round with violet riband (for
Mit. BABLOW was acquainted with the ecclesiastical colour of the
Lenten season), and then continued, " I am indeed unacquainted
with the anecdote you have just named, MASTER TOMMT,
but I will forthwith illustrate, strikingly, another, concerning
Greenland, which is called The Rod and the Rising Wales. BINKS,

Thus was April the First kept in the Happy Home of the Beloved

PIOUS PUFFERS.
MB. PUNCH has been favoured with the Card of a certain Associa-
tion for the sale of Tea. He has no objection to make to the state-
ments of the advertisers, but he thinks this paragraph suggestive :—
"Our Tea is offered to all who wi«h to buy it at In. per Ib.; but for the
present. Local Preachers only will be allowed the Discount for selling it. If
they take the matter up heartily, the Pririlege will be continued to them
exclusively."
Punch wishes he had seen this before the first debate on the
Burials Bill. He would have sent it to one of the orators, who could
have used it against the measure. A Local Preacher who heartily
pushes the sale of tea is not likely to be pedantically observant of
what the carnal world calls good taste. We can imagine such a
Vessel dismissing a funeral concourse thus: "And now retire,
brethren and sisters, to meditation and moderate refreshment, for
which latter purpose I humbly represent unto you that there is
nothing better, in this vale of tears, than the excellent Tea which I
can supply at two shillings." Perhaps some M.P. who intends to
speak on the next stage of the Bill will register this Memorandum.
CURIOUS SON-COINCIDENCE.
PBDJCE BISMARCK celebrated his fifty-eighth birthday on Tuesday
last week. So BISMARCK, you see, was born on the First of April.
Do you know what day it is? All Fools; and BISMARCK, certainly,
is not one of them.
Minute Tithes.
AN award of a 'small rent-charge on newly cultivated market-
gardens, made by the Tithe Commissioners, has been announced
under the heading of " Market Garden Tithe." Antiquity may be
quoted for this tribute, of whose payment certain parties in Palestine
once made a pretence of merit. Under the head of Garden Tithe,
our modern Sabbatarians might, like their predecessors, pay tithe
on mint, anise, and cummin. Only some of them are Nonconformists,
who would not pay any tithe whatsoever if they could help it.

RIDDLE FROM RUSSIA.
IT is, of course, complimentary to us English that the "highly
cultivated Russians" should condescend to recognise our language
at all. We are too proud of their deigning to use any of our
barbarous jargon to think of complaining that, when they advertise
in English, they do not take much trouble over a " nice derangement
of epitaphs." Here is an advertisement sent to us from the St.
Petersburg Exchange News. It has appeared four times without
aoy correction, so we suppose it is understood in Russia:—
LAND-HOLDER.

ronreHHion, or faith to have clrcumHtanees Immobility, although a
half dmlffuadon. To addreaa Add I DC protographlc card: Orel
IHmte.rcHtant Si. S,
After giving to this announcement our most deliberate study, we
ceem to arrive at the conclusion that the writer is a young landed
proprietor, with an inalienable income, who wishes to make a
brilliant marriage with a young lady of the orthodox Greek persua-
sion, who has also an inalienable income, although this latter is a
secondary consideration. But why he has taken so much pains
with his Dictionary, and why he advertises at all in what he sup-
poses to be English, we do not understand. If he will explain in a
similar charming style, our columns shall be as open to him as Khiva
is to the arms of his Czar.
UNIVERSITYIFAVOURS.
OXFORD and Cambridge each denotes her Crew,
This with a light, that with a darker blue.
Our damsels, too, those several colours wear;
For ribbons any pretext serves the Fair.
But man may mark, and ask the reason why,
They nearly all the Cambridge ensign fly.
Do Cantabs, then, Oxonians much excel
In person, manners, mind, magnetic spell?
Or can it be that girls at large adore
The Classics less, the Mathematics more?
Such questions may philosophers perplex;
Ah, versed too little with the gentler sex,
Thou verdant Sage! Compare those rival blues;
With dress and wearer, both, connote their hues.
Into thy mind this truth will then be borne:
The more becoming 'tis that's mostly worn.
"A Short Life and (not) a Kerry one."
(Apropos c/M. GafivY's resignation of tin Preiidtney of the Asiemblte
National*.)
SUCH an Assembly can scarce last long,
Now even GREVI finds thrir sauce too strong.
The French Game of War.
THE Due n'Ausui.u, on his reception at the French Academy the
other evening, made a speech in which he said, "Poor France, pick
up thy broken sword, labour, and take heart." The son of the KINO
OF THE FRENCH has known, as they phrase it, how to talk to his
country. "Pick up thy broken sword is good, but would not the
picture suggested by that advice have been improved upon in sig-
nificance if the apostrophe had been, " Poor Franoe,'pick up thy
broken drum"?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH'S DESIGNS AFTER NATURE.
GBEAT SENSATION FOB THE AQUABIU1I—COIFFURE OCTOPUS.
LIGHT IN LOW LIFE.
SCIENTIFIC sages, for some time, were sure that BrHOS made a mistake in
Manfred, where the Spirit of Ocean sings: —
"In the blue depth of the waters,
Where the wave hath no strife.
Where the wind is a stranger.
And the sea-snake hath life.
Where the mermaid is decking.
Her green hair with shells;'
Like the storm on the surface.
Came the sound of thy spells."
Their Sapiences held that, oat of soundings, as soundings then were, there
could be no life at the bottom of the sea. Since then, however, the sea has been
sounded full fathom two thousand, and more, and living creatures have been
detected in its bed, which may therefore be compared to many a one in a marine
lodging house. To be sure, the explorers have not caught the sea-serpent yet,
nor dredged up a mermaid, but they have discovered lots of other wonderful
forms of seafaring] animal life. Among these some are furnished with eyes,
and the question is how do they see with them? Certainly another poet than
the noble one above quoted avers, anonymously, that:—
"The sun's perpendioular height
Illumined the depths of the sea."
But, although in this statement also poetry may turn out to coincide with
in ittrr-of-fact, one does not see how any fish can do so with a mile and a half
-it water between them and the sun. Far-darting Apollo can hardly be sup-
posed capable of shooting his beams such a long way as down to the deepest
recesses of Neptune. Yet the inhabitants of these regions rejoice not only in
eyes, but also in vivid colours—like you, dears. DR. C. WYVILLE THOMSON,
inlhis recent work, The Depths of the Sea, suggests that the submarine light
may, below a certain depth, be afforded to the population by one another, many
of them being phosphorescent. If that is so, then these radiant denizens of
the deep, which lighten the darkness of Davy Jones's looker, are your true
radiala; these, look you, zoologists, are your genuine star-fishes.

vol.'HIT. B
A STATUE FOB LOWE.
SHALL our ROBERT have a statue?
If so, we must agree
What the style, cost, and materials
Of that monument should be.
First, the work must please our AYRTON,
So it must not be a job;
Then for cost, we must insist on
Our bob's-worth for our BOB.
For material—precious metals,
Of course we must discard:
E'en true bronze would come expensive,
And AYRTON soreweth hard.
And I hardly fancy marble
For such a work would do,
Unless a new cheese-Parian
In Attic quarries grew.
Alabaster, in our climate.
Would hardly last as long
As BOB'S fame, in joint-keeping
Of his Budgets, and our song:
Perhaps of all materials,
Brass must fiitest be confest—
Not the true ^Es Corinthiaca,
But one mixed of worst and best.
As for style—we must discover
A kind of golden mean,
Where the modern free and easy,
Blent with the old classic 's seen.
But of sentiment, or ideal,
Not a trace the work must show;
A YKTON would hold it wicked
To waste High Art on LOWE.
Then for treatment, some would tell you,
That, considered by the card,
As BOB treats deputations,
It could not be too hard:
Nor could it, if the treatment
Of BOB'S statue modelled be,
Oa the treatment Clerks and Writers
Get from BOB'S own Treasurie.
But Punch's pet-designer
Long since the statue planned:
On a basis of old Budgets,
With a save-all in its hand.
In which—for useful purpose—
As utility's the go.
We might candle-ends stick nightly,
Aud, as street-lamp, light up LOWE!
His form must stand defiant,
In act a cheese to pare:
With his sharp, shrewd tongue in action,
And his pen drawn keen and bare.
And every one that sees it
From afar, must cry—" That's Low*!'
Aud in his smile sardonic,
Instinctively, read "No."
If, as usual, on the pedestal,
Four bat-reliefs appear,
In one, I 'd have LOWE making
Five quarters of a year:
In another, BULL from Income-tax
Respite to ask should go—
"Bas-relief" you may call it,
Who ask that boon from LOWE!
In the third, I would show ROBERT
In MAT ARNOLD'S mantle dight;
And on it this inscription,
"Sweetness, behold, and Light"
One hand from sugar taking
Half a farthing in the pound;
One behind, a match-box hiding,
With " Lucellum ex Luce " crowned.
In the fourth, I 'd have the subject
That this week's Cartoon has hit—_
BOB, his " conscience money " dropping
luto JOHN BULL'S letter-slit:
With look and gesture, saying,
"This penny back to earn,
Say, Income-tax Assessors,
How oft your screw must turn?"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
'WAS Monday, April 7.—
Master Slender cried
"Mum" when the
supposed Mistress
Ann Page was to
cry " Budget; " but
his experiment was
not so successful as
to induce the House
of Commons to imi-
tate it to-night.
Although ME. LOWE
was to proclaim Bud-
get, the House was
so far from being
Mum that it asked
two columns of ques-
tions before it would
allow the CHANCBL-
LOB OF THE EX-
CHEQUER to get at
business.
One query was to
the point, and it was
raised by MB. STA-
PLETON, who quietly
demanded whether
(recollecting Ameri-
can unpleasantness)
British subjects were
not to be prevented
from raising money
to promote the cause
of CHABLES THE
SEVENTH in Spain.
Ma. GLADSTONE said that the Crown Lawyers saw nothing illegal in the
subscription, and therefore that it would not be interfered with. Well, we
allowed GAEIBALDI to obtain arms and money here in order to place VICTOB
EMMANUEL where he now is, and we suppose that the same rule _ must apply,
especially as we do not even recognise the Spanish Republic. But if Spain were
not a weak Power, we might hear a little more on this subject.
MB. CHICHESTEB FOBTESCTTE was, shall we say. a little explosive ?—no, only
a little impressive, in his declaration that the Board of Trade Had no favouritism
which would prevent certain of MB. PUMSOLL'S accusations from being fully
investigated.
MB. AYBTON made an observation which Mr. Punch—not that gentleman's
most devoted admirer—records with pleasure. In reference to some Mosaics in
the Central Hall, MB. AYBTON said that the artist received £150 for his design,
while the mere mechanics who carried it out received £500. He did not call
this encouragement of Art; and in reference to Frescoes, he had determined not
to go on with them, desiring to have works of Art, and not revivals of the works
of a semi-barbarous period of decoration. It is clear that the . Kilile has been
thinking over these matters, and that some correct ideas are beginning to dawn
on his mind.
In reply to complaint by MB. G. BENTINCK about Counts Out. Ma. GLADSTONE
said that he was not in the House on the preceding Friday, as he was unable to
leave his bed all day. At this the Liberals broke into loud cheering. They
reminded Mr. Punch of what Cousin Phcenix said about the duty, in his days,
of cheering whenever MB. PITT'S name was mentioned, and about the House
being ready to applaud if a Member had announced that MB. PITT had tumbled
down in a fit in the lobby.
MB. C. BENTINCK mentioned that MB. CHADWICK had Counted Out the
House from spite. But he immediately withdrew the un-Parliamentary word,
and substituted " Retaliation," which, being a word of six syllables, was of
Bourse more soothing to the feelings than a word of one. There is a singularly
bidden virtue in polysyllables, and, indeed, in all redundancy of expression.
Tell a man that he is a stupid ass, and he does not, as a rule, look much pleased;
but tell him that he appears to you to fail in the power of exactitude in appre-
ciating the question at issue, and he smiles, as if you had done him a favour.
MB. C. BENTINCK also observed that the Opposition always Counted Out with
great judgment, but the Ministerialists did not; a remark not received with
unanimous plaudit.
But then, Madam, we got at the Budget for 1873. MB. LOWE did not make
a very effective speech. Some said that he was not in good form, having been
incensed with his colleagues for not letting him pay off all the Alabama money.
Be this as it may, he spoke briefly—little over the hour—and was a good deal
Bothered with his figures. His points were these:—
1. Unexampled prosperity, in ipite of Continental troubles, Strikes, a bad
Harvest, and High Prices.
2. We have a surplus of £5,895.000.
3. He hoped we should never have to pay another sum of £3,200,000 in
gold, by referring questions to arbitration.
4. We shall pay only one half of that sum out of the revenue of the year,
and the rest, without new taxation by Exchequer
Bonds, if finances are unlucky.
5. He takes off half the Sugar Duty, after May 8th.
6. He takes One Penny off the Income-tax. Hers he
probably Winked at his Private Mind, and mur-
mured something about Surcharges, which enable
him very well to afford a slight expenditure of
Conscience Money. Oar Income-tax is now to be
Three Pence, which, he added, yields quite as
much aa when SIB ROBEBT PEEL laid it on, at
Seven Pence, in 1842.
. He exempts from Taxation Hotel Servants and
those "of persons who deal in intoxicating
liquors." It must be allowed that the latter have
been his generous Benefactors) and from his point
of view ought to be rewarded.
. Thus, he reduces the surplus to £291,000.
. Daring the year he will pay the Americans their
Three Millions odd, reduce The Debt by £6,000,000,
and relieve taxation by £2,885,000.
There was the usual provisional comment. The Agri-
culturist* complained that nothing was done for them.
But, if signs are to be trusted,—
"Yes, honest Farmer, you may trust our rhyme;
Something trill follow—at a fitting time."
SIB WILFBTD LAWSOJT made a very fair protest against
any rejoicing at our having Drunk ourselves out of the
Alabama difficulty. We have done it, though. SIK
WALTEB SCOTT quotes—
"0 the parish, the parish, thfl parish,
0 the parish of bonny Glenfell!
They 've hangit the Minister, stickit the Precentor,
Buiit the Church, and drunk the Bell."
He "thinks he should like to have known something of
these meritorious people." We have not degenerated.
Warnings were given, from several quarters, against
the present system of assessing the Income-tax.
MB. LOWE said that the country was still on the full
tide of prosperity. •
Resolutions in favour of portions of the scheme were
agreed to, and the House rose for the holidays, until
the 21st.
Touching the weather at this season, Madam, Mr.
Punch would make a Shakapearian remark or two.
Mercutio accuses Benvolio of " falling out with a Tailor
for wearing his new doublet before Easter." Gentlemen
never fall out with tailors, except when they make bad
clothes, or want to be paid. But any tailor, or other
person, who put on new garments before this present
Easter, must have been an idiot. Pandoras says that if
Cresiida were not his relative "she would seem as fair
to him on Friday as Helen on Sunday." All the ladies
whom Mr. Punch beheld on Good Friday looked pinched
and reproachful, thanks to the East Wind, and things
were not mended on Easter Sunday. Posterity may like
to know that the general condition of the English mind
at this period of history was that of unadulterated Solki-
ness—a reflection of the skies.
TEMPLARS GRAND AND PETTY.
A MYSTERIOUS and august transaction was solemnised
on the evening of Monday last week at the Freemason's
New Hall, in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.
This was no less than the fusion of the English and Irish
3rders of the Knights Templar of the most Ancient and
Honourable Community of Freemasons. The PBINCE
OF WALES, as head of the Order, presided, and the
proceedings concluded with a banquet, whereat, of
;ourse, the usual loyal toasts were drunk in the usual
jenerous liquors. It is, however, hardly necessary to
mention this circumstance for the purpose of preventing
any mistake about the fusion of the Knights Templar,
which would involve the confusion of that Order with
the Association whose Members modestly style themselves
jfood Templars, for the sake of a distinction which of
course they do not mean to be invidious, but perhaps
sonsider to be insufficiently apparent from deportment,
language, and costume.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE KITCHEN AND THE NURSERY.
N theT whole,
there can be no
doubt that food
for the mind is
considered of
less value now
than food for
the body, at any
rate so far as
our families are
concerned. As
a rule, at least,
a Cook is paid
far better than
a Governess,
and has far leas
to do for tile
moneythat she
gets. Wellnigh
e very Cook now
expects to have
aKitchenmaid,
who does more
than half her
work; and any
Cook who con-
descends to
serve without
a Eitchenmaid
expects to have
assistance daily
from a char-
woman ; and is
much too lady-
like to scrub her kitchen floor. "We have now a glut of Governesses and a dearth
of Cooks, and we fear there is no likelihood of the former class combining and
going out on strike. Yet this would be a strike which we should see with real

pleasure, if it could fairly be maintained to a successful
end. Meanwhile, Cooks might be hired more cheaply if
there were less demand for them, and this young ladies,
in due time, have in their power to decrease. If young;
ladies would but learn the noble art of cookery, they
might yearly save their parents some considerable out-
going, and might, on marriage, spare their husbands the
expense of hiring high-priced Cooks. South Kensington
is now affording- them the means of acquiring the art in
ijuestion. and Mr. Punch earnestly recommends them to
join the Provisional Classes.
A MODERATE MONSTER,
ANABCHY progresses at a quiet pace. At a meeting of
delegates representing above a hundred of the London
Trades' Societies, held on Wednesday last week, at the
Bell, Old Bailey, it was resolved to hold a "Monster De-
monstration of the Trades of London, in support of the
total repeal ef the Criminal Law Amendment Act, and
to protest against all special legislation for Trades' Union-
ists, and the application of the law of conspiracy as laid
down by JUDGE BEETT in the recent trial of the gas-
stokers." The Trades' Unionists, when they propose to
unite in a Monster Demonstration, appear to accept the
name of "the Many-headed Monster." The self-styled
Monster designs to roar at the Government and Legisla-
ture "in Hyde Park, or some other suitable place, on
a day to be named." Saint Monday, perhaps, would
best suit the Striking Classes, who largely keep that
festival.
But your Monster will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove. The Striking Men are comparatively
reasonable in their demands. Merely to ask for the
repeal of the Criminal Law Amendment Act is moderate
as times go. It is almost a wonder the Monster does not
demand the repeal of the Criminal Law altogether, and
roar "No Punishment!"
THE PLEASUEES OF THE TABLE.
DRESSING in a desperate hurry to dine with most punctual and
particular people, mislaying your studs, failing in several attempts
at a symmetrical arrangement of your tie, compelled after many
postponements to wear your new boots which prove to be tight
across the instep, missing the train, and having to wait twelve
minutes for another ; and at last entering the PUCKERINGS' drawing-
room to find everybody assembled, and to be made uncomfortably

of dinner, that it is for you and yon alone that host and hostess,
guests and cook, have all been impatiently and indignantly waiting.

your main inducement to face the fog and the thaw, is conducted
by a wealthy and widowed ironmaster to a chair at the extreme end
of the table, and on the same side of it as yourself.
Somewhat sated with Miss BRUMBY'S views on the struggle be-
tween Capital and Labour, and the attitude Russia is assuming in
Central Asia, finding, when you turn to the lady on your left, that
it is MBS. CYRIL BOHCASTLE an enthusiastic admirer of the REV.
J.oi rrs PRIESTCRAFT, to whose fantastic proceedings at St. Jerome's
yon are diametrically opposed.
Sitting next the lady of the house—one in which the dishes are

a large party, and afterwards to deal with a popular turkey—your
inability to carve even the simplest joint being a matter of ludicrous
notoriety in your own domestic circle.
Turning somewhat sharply round when the servant offers you a
sweet in the composition of which cream largely predominates, and
thereby causing a deposit of the whole contents of the dish in the
new blue silk lap of your rather stiff neighbour.
Having directly opposite to you at table the lady who returned all
your letters and presents last winter, and whom you have not met
since that well-remembered day, when she suggested that it would
be better for you not to come again to Upper Cheveley Street.
Dining with the I'INCHAMS, and, in ignorance or forgetfulness
of the established fact that the quality of their wines is more than
doubtful, going through a course of experimental chemistry with
their sherry, hook, champagne, and claret, in a fruitless search for
some liquid which will not embitter your to-morrow.
Dining in company with your doctor, who has lately put you on a
strict regimen, and knowing that there is hardly a thing on the table
which he has not forbidden you to touch.
Being a highly nervous man, and choking, or having to talk to a
deaf stranger, or becoming aware that your artificial teeth are every
instant growing more and more insecure.
Being the only man of the party who does not hunt, and having
to listen, after dinner, when the ladies are gone, to narratives of
capital days with the South Yoickshire or MR. WENTWORTH GAMS-
TON'S Hounds, particularly on that memorable occasion when they
found in Toddington Gorse, and, after a splendid run of an hour
and forty-five minutes, killed in LORD SAXONDALE'S shrubberies.
Going up into the drawing-room, and being induced to take a hand
at whist, when you are conscious that you are a most indifferent
player, and never remember what cards are out after the first two
rounds. Finding that your partner is a lady who knows the game
almost as well as CA VKN wxn himself, but has all her finesse spoiled
by your blunders; while your opponents—one of them a man you
have not spoken to for years—are both accomplished performers,
and win every rubber, and all your, and, what is far worse, all
Miss PENDLEHAM'S silver.
Turning the corner of your street, and seeing a fire-engine and a
mob in the middle of the road, and discovering, after a brief interval
of suspense, that the engine and the mob are before your own door,
and that it is your own kitchen chimney which _ is throwing out soot
and sparks at V |.~> I-.M.—eight persons, including a newly-married
couple, being expected to dinner at 6'30.
Inviting several friends to come and help you to eat a haunch of
venison which LORD DABTHOOR has been good enough to send you;
and being informed by your cook, on the morning of the day ap-
pointed for the feast, that the venison is not fit to appear at table.
Having made your adienx to your host and hostess, to be told by
the servant in the hall that it is a pouring wet night, and that there is
not a cab to be got anywhere. Walking home in the rain, and dis-
covering, when you reach your lodgings, that you have forgotten
your latch-key, and standing for ten minutes on the door-step, until
the domestic can be roused to let you in.
Derangement of the digestive organs.

"PREVENTION," said a Sanitary Reformer, "is better than cure."
The Medical Man to whom this observation was addressed, smiled,
and replied, "That may be all very true in theory, but the reverse
is what we always find to be the case in Practice."

(Mr. Punch's Last Treatury Minute.)
A NASHYTH'S steam-hammer serves equally well
To weld a great anchor, or crack a nut's shell;
And the Elephant's trunk the same credit will win,
Set to pull up an oak, or to pick up a pin.
But whatever the work by our Treasury done,
Of suoh double duties, it aims but at one:
It fulfils its small function, to pare and to pinch,
See each candle burnt out to its uttermost inch;
See each cheese to its horniest bottom pared down,
And no service so close-shaved as that of the Crown.
But to show BULL the way hard-earned millions to spare,
To see that the national books are kept square,
On Treasury hammer and trunk never call.
Or you '11 find that their worth is—j ust nothing at all!
For the more penny-wisdom our Treasury shows,
On a scale more superb its pound-foolishness grows;
And the closer its grip of the coppers, we see,
The gold through its lingers run all the more free.
On a penny unvouched in its audit 'tis down,
But out of eight thousand* lets BULL be done brown;
On the waste of red tape strictest checks 'twill impose,
But sees hundreds of thousands! ta'en under its nose;
Of assize prosecutions it outs down the cost,
That rogues may go free, and Crown-verdicts be lost:
To big jobs opes the door, knocking small on the head;
And one sinecure lops, to make two in its stead;
Cool Treasury trunk! It can pick up our pins—
But for rending our oaks, ask when that work begins—
And the Treaa'ry, invited to blush, only grins!

THE PEOPLE AT PENANCE.
EXCEPTION has been taken by thoughtful Churchmen to the enjoy-
ment of Good Friday by the Masses as a holiday, instead of its
proper observance as a fast. This fault, however, is not found with
the People by any one who haa ever mingled with them on that
anniversary at any place of public amusement or recreation open to
them. They resort to every such place, the Crystal Palace for
example, iu their thousands, and so many thousands that they
crowd it almost to suffocation, and quite to such an extent as to
render one another, as well as everybody else, extremely uncom-
fortable. Thus, in effect, they observe Good Friday, practically, as
a day of real penance; and the truth is that they are chargeable
with uncanonical behaviour only in making Easter Monday, and
Whit Monday, days of the same penitential endurance too. What
austerities can equal the mutual punishment which, on those two
days, the People are accustomed to undergo of their own accord,
jammed together, pushing, squeezing, jostling each other, and
treading on each other's toes, whilst utterly incapacitated from

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
All among the Mineral*—a Word on Vegetables—Hints and Sug-
gestions for a new Guide to the British Museum, adapted to the
meanest capacity.

OBSAJTJNG the Vegetables (Botani-
cal Department) for another time,
when Asparagus shall be cheaper
and better, I made for the Minerals.
One word on Asparagus. Imagine
what most have been the primitive
Gigantic Asparagus of the Great
Antediluvian Pantomimic Period! Asparagus grew, then, in forests.
The song would have been—
Woodman, spare that Asparagus!
Touch not its blooming top,
Protect it from the sparrer, Gus,
Until we 've got a crop.
"'Gus," in the third line is supposed to be the "Woodman's name.
Figurez vous the Asparagus grown to fit the mouth of the single-
eyed Polyphemus! But to proceed.
It is a little startling to a Representative Person of nervous tem-
perament to find oneself suddenly among the " Arsenic Group," a
term that might be applied, with much propriety, to two or three
groups of figures in MADAME TUSSAUD'S Chamber of Horrors. But
here it is a harmless party under a glass case, which you would pass
without noticing but for the appalling name in the catalogue.
My attention was attracted by the specimens of the Rhombohedral,
and the Oblique or Clinorhombio Systems— the latter sounding like one
of Touchstone's divisions of lying. The Oblique or Clinorhombio
System is one, alas! in favour with many who might be put under
glass cases and labelled as fossilised Humbugs of the nineteenth
century. But this is to be moral not mineral, so, as the Showman
says, _0n we goes again," using our pockethandkerchiefs, and not
breathing? on the glass cases.
The ninth case brought me to a standstill, for I had been wan-
dering. But now, as the poet says,
"I ceased to wander,
And began to ponder"
on the marvellous Minerals under my very nose—beneath my very
eyes. Description fails me: the Catalogue comes to my aid:—
"Case 9. — Molybenite (Mo S,) and Realgar (As, SJ are
severallyodemim and arsenic disulphides; the former is a rhom-
bohedral, the latter an oblique Mineral."
To all friends from the country seeing the sights of Lunnon the
above will be a piece of really useful information.
Then follows a charmingly picturesque bit—" Here is included
Laurite, the rare ruthenium sulphide."
It sounds like a character in a Fairy Ballet, as, indeed, do almost
all the names. They would come in admirably in a Mineral
Kingdom Scene.
DBAMATTS FEB80N.S:.
Molybdenite (A Lovely Creature)..... MDLLE. FANDANGO.
Realgar (Her Lover: a troubadour) . . . M. TIPTOE..
Laurite (The Rare Ruthenium Sylphide). MDLLB. HENRIETTA D'Oa,
There you have it, or rather there I have it all before me. And
the specimens of Pronstite and Pyragyrite (with Pyragyrations)
should be the Sprites and Tumblers of the entertainment.
I recognise, however, the truth of what I have laid before; namely,
that this is not the spirit wherein to visit the British Museum. Let
us be serious. Lead on, I follow, with further suggestions for a
new Guide to the Collections.
Division III. Cases 13,14, Sect. i. This looks like a reference to
a book of Legal Precedents. It isn't. It is simply to draw the
visitors' attention to "Compounds of the Halogen Elements."
"The Salts in this division are represented,' the book informs me,
"by certain fluorides."
On inspection I found the salts to be genuine Old Salts. I shouldn't
like to call an Old Salt a Double Fluoride. Let somebody else try
it first and report progress. It can be attemptedion the beach at
Brighton.
In Cote 16 (fj will be seen the " Spinel Group," which, from the
name, one would have thought represented the backbone of the col-
lection. Considered from this point of view it is weak.
Case 20. The Tin Stone. Most interesting, if you can find it. I
couldn't. I contented myself with the information, in the Guide
Book, that "Its pellucid varieties are gems," and that " the Dull
green is the Jargoon," whereon my friend WAQG remarked that
the Jargon was uncommonly dull.
Case 21. In the same aeries is the Rutile. As this mineral is of
no great use to anybody in its present form, it doesn't combine
the Rutil» with the Duke. To which joke of WAGG'S ME. TOOLE,
in Don Giovanni might say, "Pah!" Apropos of Don O., I
recommend ajiy one scientifically interested in the Terpsichorean
Art to go and see the Dancing Quakers. To enjoy this thoroughly a
happy day should have been spent at the British Museum.
In the fourth Division—this sounds like a military variety, but,
again, it isn't—Walk up, walk up, and see The Dolomite and The
Ankerite! kl'he latter being a sort of Mineral Hermit without
any legs.
The Female Minerals are represented by the Silicates. Here I
made a discovery of the greatest interest to all admirers of the
works of MB. WILKTE COLLINS. In Case 46 (>")—and I give the
direction clearly in case you should otherwise miss it—I came upon
"Tlf Moonstone." I cannot say I was surprised to find this among
the Minerals, as I had always ranked MB. COLLINS'S novels among
the gems. Suivez moi, s. v. p. Here is " Gypsum." It is a Cam-
bridge Mineral. The name is composed of two words, Gyp, "a
server," and sum "I am." The meaning being, I am a useful
mineral.
Case 57.—Here you will find, if no one has removed it since I was
there, and / didn't, the Haidingirite, the Erinite, the Uranite, the
Antunite, the Leadhillite, and the Lagulite. And, strange to say,
at my elbow, looking into the case, was an unmistakable specimen
of the Israelite. He was humming, nasally, the air of MB.
FBEDEBICK CLAY'S popular song, Nobody's Nose like my Nose.
In the same case were " splendid Specimens of Apatite." This
settled me. It was one o'clock, and I had long felt a craving. So I
determined upon taking "a splendid specimen" of my Appetite
to a neighbouring Restaurant's.
Happening at this moment to refer to the Catalogue, I found that
the Guide to the Mineral Department was signed by MB. MASKELYNE.
It now occurred to me (memory being roused into action by the
aforesaid splendid Appetite) that I had long promised myself a visit
to MESSBS. MASKELYNE & COOK (and, were the latter a woman-cook,
their entertainment might be called Maskelyne and Feminine), at
St. James's Hall. Thither I repaired, and refreshed exhausted
nature. Then I went to see how MESSBS. MASKELYNE & COOK do
all the Spiritualist tricks without any of the oharlatanio humbug.
The Cabinet and Box are very clever, and defy every ordinary eye.
Neither of mine is an ordinary eye, and I should like (or rather I
shouldn't) to hear anybody say that "black's the white of it"
(N.li. This was a mot of other days), but my eyes were defied, and I
retired with some dignity. After all, Sir, who wants to know how
things are done? Life's too short for Inquisitiveness, a fact I could
wish you, Sir, to bear in mind, when you put queries to your Repre-
sentative as to his next intentions.
This digression took me far away from the Fossils, to which I am
obliged, contrary to my intention, but in chivalrous fulfilment of my
promise, to return in my next. As before, so now,
YOUB RBTBESENTATTVE.
Harmony in the Church.
THE arrival of a new Curate is always an interesting event in the
Antm1n of a Parish, and to the ladies of his congregation it can never
be a matter of indifference whether he is married or single, and
likely to be an agreeable acquisition to Society. But it is seldom
that a parish is so exceptionally favoured as one in the immediate
neighbourhood of London, which has just secured the services of a
reverend gentleman, who is described as a "musical bachelor." Of
the popularity of this new Curate with a large and interesting sec-
tion 01 his flock, no one, with any experience of Scenes of Clerical
Life, can have the slightest doubt.

THE NEXT ELECTION.
Ethel. "PAPA, YOU IIUST VOTE FOE MK. MOUNTEBANK, OK WE SHALL NOT GET INVITATIONS TO THE BALLS AT LORD HIQHBOPE'S,
HIS UNCLE, you KNOW I"
POETEY AND PROSPECTUS.
ME. MILTON had an ear for sonorous names. He was the author
of certain lines which will be recollected by most of our young men
and girls who mingle in dances and pic-nics:—
"And all who since, baptised or infidel,
J »u«ted in Aspramont or Montalban,
Danasco, or Morocco, or Trebisond."
Mn, PILGAHLIC has received the Prospectus of a Joint Stock Com-
pany, containing in each of the subjoined paragraphs a string of
names which may be contrasted with the above in Paradise Lust, as
being, if perhaps as imposing as those, not quite so euphonious:—
"This Company has been established for the purpose of developing, under
improved management, the valuable Nicolajevski Colliery, close to the Gru«-
chevka Station of the Voronesh-Roatoff Railway, and also for acquiring and
working 12 other raining areas, situate at Yladimersky, near the Sulin Sta-
tion on the same Bailway, which passes through the property.
"Both properties are in direct communication by Railway with Moscow,
Biaian, Tamboff, Sarotoff, Voronesh, and Rostoff, and the principal ports of
the Sea of Azoff and the Black Sea, namely. Taganrog, Sevastopol, and
Odessa; also by the River Don and the Volga-Don Railway with the River
Volga and the Caspian Sea."
The names of places above enumerated certainly seem to MB.
PILGABLIC somewhat more to the purpose than those of Noblemen,
and other ornamental persons, which sometimes figure on lists of
Directors. Be that as it may, the foregoing prosaic parallel to
MILTON'S poetry is but one out of innumerable communications of
the same kind for which MB. Pri.o.vni.ic is indebted to unknown
friends, who can possess no more information respecting him than
what they may have gleaned from a professional Directory. Thence,
probably, they have surmised that he may, in the course of years,
have amassed some small savings, which he would be glad to invest
so as to secure the highest possible interest for their _ amount. He
has no particular reason for doubting that the advertisers offer him
"a sweet boon." But before ME. PILQABLIC could invest even the
smallest sum at his command in any speculation whatsoever, he
would require to know all about it. This condition cannot exist.
He can, therefore, in any case, only gaze with smiling admiration
on the nicely ruled spaces of the form of application for shares,
so conveniently arranged by his kind benefactors that would be,
to facilitate that petition, which he is invited to fill up and sign.
He beg_s to thank them all for keeping him in waste paper, and thus
supplying his Vestal with the means of lighting the fire, and himself
with those of igniting his tobacco, &o. But he has to complain that
some of the prospectus-paper does not burn long enough, and to
suggest that it should be a little thicker. Companies generally are
requested to notice this intimation.
SHAKSPEARE IN THE SADDLE.
TUB successful attempt which has been lately made at Astley's
(with the reverence of our youth we stick to the old name), to place
a "page of English history " on the boards and in the sawdust, has
set us thinking of the pages and more exalted personages that might
be similarly treated by our clever hippodramatists. How easy it
would be, tor instance, to set SHAKSPEARE in the saddle, and adapt
his plays to the Astleian pomp and circumstance. Good Mr. and
Mrs. Page, and Rubin, FaUtaff's "skirted page," occur to us at
once among the pages to be mounted; and if Sir John himself were
to appear on horseback, half the town would nock to see him in his
acts of equitation.
Since the Battle of Bridgnorth has proved a great attraction, why
should not the Battle, say, of Shrewsbury, be shown in a like man-
ner? Falstaff'i ragged troop might be mounted upon screws to
make them look more comical, and the fight between the Prince and
Hotspur would be sure to bring the house down, if it were fought
on horseback. Indeed the plav of Henry the Fourth abounds with
points for hippodramatists. For instance, take the famous passage
describing how young Harry, with his beaver up, vaulted to his
seat like feathered Mercury,
"To witch the world with nible horsemanship."
See what a splendid opportunity tb.ii gives for what the playbills

A Plea for Old Tom.
THX population of London amounts to four millions.
They are continually adding to their number. Accord-
ingly, the Metropolis keeps on extending itself, and
bricks and mortar encroach daily on and abolish the
beauty of the environs of London. Can nothing be done
to arrest this spreading evil? To limit the expansion of
London in these days by law nobody would propose, for
fear of the Masses; but they would probably nave no
objection to a measure for cheapening gin. It is said that
gin stops children's growth. Would not a sufficiently
plentiful supply of it check that of London P

call a rapid transformation act. You can imagine the Prince turn-
ing a few summersaults to show his skill in vaulting, and then
throwing off his armour and appearing dressed aa Mercury, and
finally performing on his fiery untamed Pegasus a rapid act of
horsemanship, in a brilliant suit of spangles.
There are many other scenes in the historic plays of SHAKSFIABE
which are peculiarly adapted to the saddle and the sawdust. Of
course in hippodramas much depends upon the mounting, still the
audience at times condescends to hear the speeches, and SHAE-
si-E.i ar's noble language would have at least the charm of novelty
to ears which are accustomed to the words of equine writers.
Richard the Third is full of point*, in word as well as action, that
would be sure to tell at Astley's. The Duke of Norfolk, to begin
with, might be costumed as a jockey, to give a new point to the
couplet:—
"Jockey of Norfolk, be not BO bold,
For Dickon thy master ia bought and sold."
Then Juno Richard might on horseback perform prodigies of
valour, and his charger being visibly slain upon the stage, and not
behind, the scenes, as formerly, his scream—
"A hone! a hone! my kingdom for a hone!"
would be much heightened in effect, and would certainly evoke the
plaudits of the gallery.
So too the ghost-scene might be made immensely more appalling,
if the ghosts were to appear all mounted upon nightmares. Indeed
we see no reason why King Richard in his sleep should not perform
a rapid act of riding on four fiery bare-backed steeds, to which,
when he shouts out " Give me another horse I " a fifth might be led
in with an effect quite overpowering.

VICE ITS OWN PENALTY.
To the Ministerial Budget of this year the Times objects that:—
"One half only of the Alabama Indemnity is to be charged on the revenue
of the coming year, the other half being met by a draught on the Bank of
Hope."
If the Bank of Hope were an institution homogeneous with the
Band, the draught would be very much lees likely than it now is to
be honoured. At present one draught seems to meet another. The
Band of Hope youth contribute little to the revenue; but that's no
marvel, they drink no wine, neither do they consume any other
exoiseable liquors. But we (the People, or Working Classes) are
truly said to have drunk ourselves out of the Alabama difficulty.
This is sad, to be sure. It would be comparatively jolly if the
amount had all to be extorted from the Small Involuntarily-Taxed
instead of having been contributed by the Great Self-Taxed. It
would then have been paid in sober sadness—by a minority. Still,
unless the former are absolutely to pay for everybody, a taxed tap
will remain the only possible condition of a free breakfast-table.
"What you want in meat, we '11 have in drink," as Bardolph says.
So may the spontaneous tax-payers say to the others; but the latter
would be even worse off for meat than they are now if the former
had raised the prices of all provisions to a yet higher point than they
actually have, by spending less of the excess of their high wages in
gorge and more in guzzle. Moreover, of gin and other "intoxicating
liquors," at least, pecunia non oht. And, after all, the surplus
derived from the Excise is the Tribute which the Vice of Tippling
pays to the Virtue of Total Abstinence. Need Virtue be so very
indignant at the oblation?
NO BULL.
IF a person has, by the negligence or default of a Railway Com-
pany, sustained incurable injuries, can he recover? No doubt of it;
and, sure, the law in this point, if it does not, ought, by all means,
to extend to Ireland.
PETROLEUM AND PIETY.
A TELEGRAM from Perpignan the other day announced that the
Carlists were threatening to use petroleum for the purpose of burning
down houses whose inhabitants refused to pay the contributions
demanded of them. Several other messages had previously been
telegraphed to the effect that petroleum had been, or been threatened
to be, employed by the Carlists as an incendiary agent on behalf of
Legitimacy and Divine Right. Petroleum is a substance so like
pitch that one wonders that the saying that none can touch it with-
out being defiled, particularly those who employ it in arson, after
the manner of the Communists and Red Republicans, has not
occurred to such loyal and religious enthusiasts as the Carlists. An
advertisement, soliciting subscriptions in aid of those insurgents, has
appeared in the Westminster Gazette. The Gazette, truly, is a credit
to the diocese so called. Are the faithful who call it a diocese
authorised, if they please, to contribute money wherewithal Carlist
incendiaries may purchase petroleum P

IRISH JURIES.
(From the Dublin Denouncer.)
ASK Saxons grieve to
] md that the new Jury
System in Ireland
continues to work ad-
mirably, and that the
happiest results fol-
low, especially to the
unfortunate persons
whom society has
neglected until they
have been led into
violation of conven-
tional and other laws.
Those who are called
culprits are generally
acquitted without fur-
ther persecution. In
some cases our intel-
ligent Jurors refuse
to accept Saxon defi-
nition of so-called
crimes, and describe
such things in their
own way. A deeply injured man, who had been tyrannically
pestered for rent, though he had several times made small payments
on account, and whose nature was at last aroused to indignation,
knocked the collector into a ditch, and set dogs upon him. The
Jury found him " Not guilty," and most logically, for he was indeed
not guilty of betraying the cause of his beloved Ireland. Another
patriot who had protested, through the mouth of a blnnderbus,
against a notice to quit the sacred soil on which he had been reared,
wag found guilty of trespass, for he had trespassed against arbitrary
law, but he was cordially recommended to mercy and reward. In
some instances where duty to Ireland is not concerned, Juries have
used their own common sense, regardless of a scowling Judge and a
sneering Counsel. A man who was indicted for setting a friend's
house on fire was convicted of petty larceny, and another who had
poisoned his neighbour's cows was found guilty of burglary; while
a third, who had blown up a mill, was acquitted, on the ground
that several of his relatives had been sent to penal servitude, and
that the law ought not to be hard on an afflicted family. It may
be considered, by the cold-blooded, matter of regret that our Juries,
when looked up, have frequently engaged in personal conflict; but
we would rather that the noble Irish nature thus found vent for
excitement than that men should sit calmly weighing probabilities,
and comparing testimonies, while a fellow-creature stands trembling
and shuddering in the accursed dock. At present, oases in which
accounts and pecuniary matters are at issue, are the chief stumbling-
block, and we are aware that what would be called " business" by
the callous London citizen or the selfish Scotch merchant is not
thoroughly understood, or, rather, is thoroughly ignored by the
Irish Juror, who recognises a higher law than that of COCK KB, and
in his simple, pious, Catholic way, strives to equalise the advantages
of suitors, and deprives the rich man of his gains, only that the
poor man may be more content with his lot. This is natural justice,
and long may it be administered by the brave Irish Juror, in defiance
of impious Saxon cant.
A Second Donation.
IT is announced that the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers
have granted fifty guineas towards the building of a chapel for the

Ventnor. This is a new obligation which the Fishmongers have now
conferred on those invalids. The Consumptive had already to
thank the Fishmongers for Cod's-liver Oil.

THE SIAMESE TWINS.
(A prop>os of'the Newcastle Co-operative Congress.)
CO-OPBRATB—co-operate—co-operate, ad libitum.
Mountains may grow of mole-hills—one great of many small!
Workers are winners ever: they are idiots who 'd prohibit 'em
From the long pull, and the strong 'pull, and the pull of one
and all.
Yes: the working-arm's the lever—with that, like Archimedes,
We 've power to move the great round Globe, a larger Loggan
stone:
But a " pou sta " to begin with, a fulcrum pur first need is,
And Labour without Capital's an arm without the bone.
That war-cry—" Down with Capital! "—is that the voice of
Labour?
"Not such a fool!" says Labour. "I need tools as well as hands.
If instead these tools of owning, I 'ye to hire them of my neighbour,
Labour is but the Private—Captain Capital commands!
"Bat if Labour save and spare, and lump his littles to a miokle,
Grow his own plant, find his own tools, materials, machines,
Money may be as tight as wax, the market may be fickle,
Labour is lord of his own ends, once he has made his means.
"Why? Not because he's managed to do away with Capital,
But because he's wisely taken his own Capital to raise.
For Capital and Labour's bond is flesh and blood: once snap it all,
You '11 find one life runs in his veins, who's paid, and his who
pays.
"Yes, Capital and Labour are the Chang and Eng of nature:
The Siam twins—united in birth, and growth, and death:
They wax and wane together: one in health, and strength, and
stature;
One blood in heart, one life in brain, in lungs one common breath.
"Through clash of Mischief's cymbals, noise of Folly's pipe and
tabor,
Let Common Sense her still small voice wide as the world make
heard—
Capital still is Capital, and Labour still is Labour:
United, the earth's shaping power: apart, an empty word 1"
Co-operation the world's rule is now. and has been ever:
All things still work together, to fulfil God's heavenly law;
If Labour be the brick that builds our pyramid, once sever
Labour from Capital—what is't? A brick without the straw.
Whoever be your Moses, and where'er your land of Goshen,
One thing is as transparent as the daylight that yon see,
That he of "Down with Capital!" who introduced the notion,
Sets you to make bricks without straw, and must your Pharaoh
be.

IMPROPER EXPRESSION.
11 THE most enjoyable number was the symphony," writes a musical oritip in
a notice of a Concert. This word " enjoyable is one of those novel expression
that have of late been intruded into the English of the Press and the Platform
Enjoyable, that which may be enjoyed; analogy defines it, for the word is no
in Johnson. In the foregoing connection it means most productive of enjoyment
The symphony, described as having been enjoyable when it was played, woulc
have been equally enjoyable if it had been murdered, or never been played a
all. It would have been enjoyable—that is, capable of being enjoyed—whethe
it was actually enjoyed or not. To say that a composition, performed at
Concert, was enjoyable, is either to represent that it was capable of being en
joyed by a lover of music, or else to suggest that it might have been enjoyed i
it had been properly performed, or could have been heard. A dinner is eat
able, and likewise enjoyable, but in being eaten it, if enjoyed, is more than
enjoyable. This word, "enjoyable" sounds like an importation from th
United States. Though not BO base a coin as "reliable," it is still not sterling
and has the ring of a dollar.

nor smells horribly of smoke.
The sight of Leicester Square improved, as it well might be, and
would soon be, if in Paris.
The sight of our brand-new silk umbrella which was taken by
mistake (of course) for a very old alpaca one we found left in
exchange for it.
The light of a pew-door in a convenient position, opened for us
gratis when we desire to listen to a fashionable preacher.
The sight of the menu of an English public dinner, where French
intelligence is shown in both the sequence and selection of the
dishes.
The sight of pictures hung " upon the line " at the Academy, for
reason of their merit, although painted by outsiders.
The sight of some of the half-sovereigns, not to mention the five'

strained to lend to out-at-elbow acquaintances.
The sight of a few rays of continuous bright sunshine, enough to
reinstate our faith in the actual existence of a working Solar
System.
The " finest site in Europe " ornamented with a building to sup-
plant the dome and pepper-boxes, and which should be truly worthy
of the situation.
The sight of a photograph of Ourself, which, in our own private
opinion, really does us any justice.
The sight of an improved specimen of omnibus, which you can
actually sit in without fear of being suffocated, and which will posi-
tively carry you as fast as your own legs.
The sight of an advertisement seeking for us as the next of kin of
a rich Somebody or other, whom we have never heard of, who has
left us all his property.
The sight of a new form of Constitutional French Government,
founded on eternal principles, and capable of enduring for upwards
of a twelvemonth.

That you conceived the notion

"So, at thy strict injunction,

Lapped up Gunpowder Tea,
Until I felt sick passim

And tasted, fast and free,
Teas from each far horizon
Of Inde and eke Chinee.

Regardless what the weather
In London Town might be?
Yes; down we sat together
To make our Hyson Tea.

OUR DOMESTIC DIGGINGS.
A CONTEMPORARY quotes a letter from one of our largest opal-
owners, also an M.I'., addressed to a friend, in which the writer,
haying stated the difficulty in raising coal he had to contend with,
owing to the want of colliers, proceeds to say :—" So, if you should
come across a good vein of skilled collier labour, content with 11is.
to 15>. a day wages, pray inform me." To be content with from
10». to 15*. a day is to be satisfied with, say, some £234 a year. If
that is to be earned by mining here, there can be no inducement for
any skilled miner to betake himself to gold or diamond diggings.
He can live in clover, on enough to satisfy all his wants, by raising
black diamonds at home. For a miner, an income of the above
amount is a salary much more adequate than £5000 for a Law
Officer of the Crown. The miner has no appearances to keep up in a
mine, where any ostentation would be so very imperfectly illumi-
nated by the Davy lamp as to be inappreciable; besides that, if it
could be seen, it would, from its incongruity with ooal-grime, be
derided. He needs not incur any expenses but those which are
necessary for his personal wants and pleasures, including champagne
and dog-fighting; which, the former luxury as well as the latter
amusement, he can manage to nil'in I well enough by a judicious
economy, above-ground, of lodgings, furniture, and clothes.
Economy in ostentation is painless to the average miner. Culture
lias not led him to imagine that other people trouble themselves
about his looks, nor does reflection, in case he is endowed with any,
admonish him to care if they did; because, in his line of life, any
opinion of theirs on that subject could have no possible effect on his
income. Herein he has the advantage of a lawyer, or a parson, or
a medical man, whose professional receipts or earnings, how beggarly
soever, are always more or less contingent on the respect for Society,
which Society expects him to demonstrate by certain proprieties of
costume, residence, and carriage. Whereas a miner is free to
inhabit a hovel, and to go about in clothes and boots patched to any
extent that suits his convenience, with a billycock hat of any
antiquity on his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, as black as his
hands and face.
It used to be common for a young man, come of parents in
respectable circumstances, to talk of going into this or that liberal
Profession. These vocations will henceforth be monopolised by the
sons of millionnaires. The only liberal profession possible for any
other youth will be one liberally remunerated, like that of mining.
A boy not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, if rationally
brought up in or within reach of a mining district, when asked what
he intends to do for a living, will answer, not that he shall enter the
Church, or the Army, or the Navy, or the Law, or the Medical
Profession, but that he intends going into the Mine. Could he d»
better?
SHORTEN TOUR DINNERS.
SYMPATHISING MR. PUNCH,
THAT melancholy time of year is now full upon us when
overworked humanity is sentenced to its annual three months of
hard labour, in the way of driving, dressing, dining, dancing, and
generally doing all sorts of disappointing and health-destroying
things.
Now, you and I, and other fellow social sufferers, would not so
bitterly complain of the hardness of our lot, were our punishment
confined within the limits of the period assigned for its duration.
But, ao lasting are the injuries it causes to our health, that, even
by the very caref ullest of living, we are barely able to restore our
shattered nerves and battered constitutions, ere the time for the
recurrence of our suffering returns.
To you and me, and others whose dancing days are over, dinners
are undoubtedly the worst part of our punishment, and I rejoice to
see that efforts are bravely being made, in certain influential quar-
ters, to procure for us some respite of the labours that afflict us.
How sorely this is needed may be guessed from this sad groan from
one of yonr contemporaries, which rarely is constrained to murmur
at such matters:—
"It is only necessary to watch the habits of what is termed ' society,' in
order to arrive at the conclusion that they are quite sufficient to account for
more than half the illnesses Buffered by those who indulge in them. ... To
lay nothing of the late hour at which people dine, many of them having caton
too much luncheon, or none at all, what an enormous variety of food they
swallow, or are expected to swallow, before they get up from the dinner table.
They could assuage their hunger and Blake their thirst comfortably in half an
hour, yet for an hour and a half or two hoars they go on eating and drinking,
night after night, and at the end of the London season bud themselves, as
they express it, 'thoroughly worn out with business.'"
On sanitary grounds, then, let us humbly pray Society—the Jug-
gernaut we worship—to spare us from the sacrifice which its fashion
of big dinners entails upon our health. Life is short, and banquets
of ten courses are decidedly too long to be undergone without im-
perilling one!s strength. Abolish then yonr entrtle, 0 my dinner-
giving friends, and let us have plain roast and boiled, like our
grandfathers of yore. Good soup, good fish, good meat, with a
salad for a relish, and a morsel of good cheese, is all that man
requires when he sits at home to dine, and why need cooks give him
more when he is tempted to dine out? A surfeit clogs his system,
and destroys his sleep; and when slowly and sadly he lays him
down to rest, depend on it he hears the hoofs of coming nightmares,
and thinks bitterly of the morrow, and his visit to the doctor.
That we may ere long have the sense to cast aside our Juggernaut,
and to prolong our lives by shortening our dinners, is the fervent
aspiration of yours piously,
The Hermitage, Mayfair. PODAGRA.
SWEETNE33 AND LIGHT.
MB. PUNCH has nut the presumption to pretend to understand thU
advertisement, but it is far too lovely to be lost. The fair adver-
tiser proclaims the merits of her "Governesses' Institute" in
Dublin. Something unwelcome seems to have happened, but that
is all over, and there'is formed in the heaven's sight one arch of peace
and loveliness. Subjoined, be it explained, is a list of distinguished
patronesses:—
MISS O'BOROO is happy to announce that her Establishment—the
first of its name—U now, and will be in future, the only one in Ste-
phen's Green. So, should another strange cloud venture, even to the sur-
roundings of this, the "brightest prospect" of Dublin, the generous breaths
of the undersigned, like so many refreshing Zephyrs, will at once send it
back to ita region, truly known by its smoke-Like effusions."
Sense in "Le Follet."
"One thing should always be borne in mind, that the material and colour
that would constitute a robe simple for a married lady, is perfectly admissible,
as a toilet parte for a young unmarried girl. This is a fact seldom lost sight
of by our fashionable motlistei, who know that it is the cut and fafon of a
toilette that constitutes its real elegance, and not the amount of money spent
on it."
PATEBFAMILIAS, who has copied this extract from the Fashions for
each of his four young unmarried daughters, is delighted to find
that the Paris modistes hold such sensible opinions, and earnestly
hopes the London dressmakers may imitate them, and come to the
same economical conclusion.

forgotten until he revived it. Therefore, Gentlemen of the Jury, be
pleased to understand that my picture simply embodies my
intolerable annoyance that once more society is to be set discussing,

duty to try, but which I wish could be tried with closed doors, and
in the absence of reporters. Now, dear Gentlemen, I leave you to a
duty which I am sure you will discharge admirably, with the aid of
the best Bench that could sit to preside over the trial, and receive
your verdict. "I will stand (or rather sit) and mark," as my

1 REAL EDIFICATION.
IF walls really had ears, and could understand what they hear,
the walls of some of our proposed national schools would be likely
to learn, on one subject at least, a great deal more than any of the
scholars whom they contain. That subject is one of no less import-
ance than the Fourth R.; as to which the Secularists propose that
schools provided by school-boards shall be open, out of school hours,
to ministers of all religious denominations, for the purpose of afford-
ing the children belonging to each of them instruction, separately,
in their several creeds. As a branch of education, a great deal is
wont to be said about religious knowledge. The most thorough
knowledge, such as that epithet distinguishes, would be the know-
ledge of religion that the walls of the Secularist schools within
which the scholars were taught it in turn, would acquire if they
were endowed with hearing and intelligence. Those walls would
know all the current religions, instead of knowing only one of them.
Then they would be in the position of being able to choose the best
for themselves, instead of being merely prejudiced with some variety
of one-sided dogmatism. Thus a Secularist school would, in a very
short time, become, more truly than any Church of any one particu-
lar sect, a religious edifice.

POSTHUMOUS BRAYING.
y' m rwnin
HE expediency of
giving executors
some discretion in
cases where the
testator has had
none at all, should
be demonstrated
to the legisla-
tors by the scrap
of news sub-
joined:—
'' EXTRAORDINABY
KECIUESTS. — CAP-
TATH «•••* of
the 2nd Battalion,
6th Begiment, sta-
tioned at Drogheda,
who died a few days
ago, requested that
after his decease a
splendid grey char-
ger, value £150,
should be shot, and
that a phaeton of
great value should
be destroyed. Yes-
terday these requests
were carried out, the
charger being shot,
and the phaeton
broken up. The deceased officer bequeathed 5s. a week to support a Newfoundland dog."
Did yon ever see a dead donkey P Yes, if you ever beheld the mortal

remains of anybody the fellow of that one who enjoined
his representatives to perpetrate the idiotic absurdity
of destroying; a valuable horse and carriage. A man
might die and endow a college, or a cat, or a dog either,
without making himself an absolute congener of the long-
eared quadruped, if that were ail; but the additional
requests that a horse worth £150, and a phaeton of
proportionate cost, should be made away with, are testa-
mentary dispositions of which no creature could be
capable less stupid than the ignoble animal above spe-
cified. Legal obligation, surely, could alone induce any
executors not as senseless as himself to carry out the
ridiculous directions of such an ass.
A LEGEND OF THE THAMES.
THE progeny of Juno
Were mongrels to behold.
The Keeper thought they 'd do no
Good, so the lot he sold.
A baker, for a shilling,
The brood entire did buy,
And of them, after killing,
He sold a rabbit-pie.
0, this delicious pasty,
So cunningly prepared
With condiments right tasty,
A water-party shared!
Thus'Ponfo, Dash, and Carlo,
Were eaten up, all three.
Beneath the Bridge of Marlow.
Ha, ha! by whom, Bargee?
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
Final touches to the British Museum—Holiday time—Farewell—A
Quiet Watering Place—A Secret—An Offer—Close of this Series.
AFTER twice considering this interesting collection, I have arrived
at the conclusion that a visitor cannot begin his examination at a
better point than that offered by Case No. 2, Upper Floor, Third
Room, where are preserved all that remains of that once playful and
amusing reptile, the Dicynodon. It is described, with truth, as
"The large and very remarkable." Its teeth were fortunately
limited to two; if there had been a few more, it is probable that the
Megatherium, the Flesiosaurus, and the other quiet members of the
Happy Family of the Great Pantomimic Period, would n9t have
stood much chance of a dinner, unless they combined and dined off
the Dicynodon.
Do not fail to notice the Gigantic Herring, three feet and a half
long. I remarked, also, a large number of prodigious Anchovies in
oil, which were, perhaps, dainty dishes for the Ogres, Cyolopian
brothers, and Gorgibnsters, of the Antediluvian Era.
I next entered Room VI., which at first sight seems to resemble
what might have been the exhibited collection of an advertising
Painless Dentist in the Edentata period. My friend WAGG imme-
diately observed that an Irishman would seize upon this last name
to jump at the conclusion that the Forbidden Fruit in Paradise was,
probably, a potato; "as," he urged, "if it wasn't, what could be
meant by the Eden-tater period?"
Promising to represent his theory in the proper quarter, I drew
his attention to the "Osseous remains of the Quadrupeds without
front teeth; "—but, with such tusks!
A board requests you not to touch the specimen of the " Giant
Ground Sloth/' How different the request would have been had he
still been living! Alas! poor Yorick.'
Every creature in this room belongs to the Great Pantomime
Period, which would have been a merry time had they had some
sparkling music; but a trifle dull without.
The Dinotherium (an animal, not a Club) seems to have been an
eccentric animal. His large tusks, being in the lower instead of the
upper jaw, and directed downwards, were probably so placed in
order to assist him, when in a joyous mood, in turning head over
heels, either for amusement or to puzzle the foe.
_ And now, Sir. in reply to your questions regarding "my inten-
tions," I reply that this is holiday time; and so, farewell.
I go to the quietest sea-side place that I can at this Easter time
(how did you like the seasonable, because Easterly, winds ?), be
found. Au revoir.
**••**
I am there. I have been here and still would go, 'tis like a little
Haven below,—being, in fact, a sea port, and called Littlehampton.
As WAGG, who accompanied me, because he professed to like a quiet
place, but who didn't expect to find it so very quiet, observed,
"There's precious little of the Hampton in it" But when I telJ
you that WAGO'S idea of solitude is the Brighton Aquarium on an
Easter Monday, you will be able to appreciate his remark for just
exactly its proper value.
Here everything is calm and peaceful. Even the Sei seems to
snore at regular intervals, while its bosom heaves placidly. Wind-
mills here go lazily and noiselessly. There are miles and miles of
sands, and your eye_ (whichever you like, my little dear) rests upon
;he green sward, lying between your front windows and the beach.
Sere children, unprotected, can roam fearlessly by day, and at night
;he bold Policeman is aluxary, scarcely a necessity.
Inland, the country is lovely, and there are the Parks of Arnndel
ind Augmering, the Grove of Nightingales, and the Romantic
Bosquet, where the something or other is caught in profusion in the
picturesque tarn, and the something else sings harmoniously on the
topmost boughs; a fact that accounts for my not having been able
to discover what he was.
I fear I am doing the place a grievous wrong in mentioning it. It
is so quiet and so private that even the proprietors of a very perfect
Little Hotel here attempt to keep its existence a secret from the
world at large; and I do not suppose I should have ever discovered
the " Belle Vue" had not an enterprising waiter, having become a
trifle tired of his monotonous life, hung up the words "Coffee
Room" on a label in the front window.
Aladdin, entering his fairy palace for the first time, could not
have been more agreeably surprised than was I at the comfort and
elegance of this establishment. The Manager and the Waiter were,
for a few moments, staggered at the sight of a stranger, but, re-
covering themselves, they proved that the genie of the Kitchen
could provide an excellent and reasonable repast. They appeared
alarmed at the chance of my disclosing their secret, and, on re-
visiting the spot next morning, I expected to find that the " Belle
Yne" had disappeared, having been spirited away to some more
remote and less known watering-place.
In order to give my readers some notion of the gaiety of this
place in the Season, I will venture to repeat the Hotel Manager's
information. "Oh, yes, Sir," said he. quite smiling and brisk in
anticipation of the future dissipation; we 're lively enough here in
the Season. Why, we engage a man to play the piano in the
drawing-room, regularly."
I could only murmur, slowly and emotionally, "Doyou,indeed!"
And then I dined at This Establishment for the Quintessence of
Quiescence, experiencing less remorse for having awoke them from
their slumbers, than I should have felt had I not seen three or four
people already seated in the snug and comfortable Salle d Manger.
Now, Sir, to my Island Home! Farewell! "Where the bee
sucks "and so forth. Your Tricksy Sprite is away for his
holiday, and, for the present, at all events, you will hear no more
of, or from, YOTJB REPRESENTATIVE.
P.S.—Of course, if you like, I can Represent You on my holiday
trip. It will save your leaving your desk, and I '11 only charge you
half expenses.

ING for the garish eye
When moonless brandlings cling I
Let the froddering crooner cry,
And the braddled sapster sing.
For, never and never again
Will the tottering beechlings play,
For bratticed wrackers are tinging aloud,
And the throngers croon in May!
The wracking globe unstrung,
Unstrung in the frittering light
Of a moon that knows no day!
Of a day that knows no night!
Diving away in the crowd
Of sparkling frets of spray,
The brattioed wrackers are singing aloud,
And the throngers croon in May!
Hasten, 0 hapf ul blue,
Blue, of the thimmering brow,
Hasten the deed to do
That shall roddle the welkin now I
For never again shall a cloud
Out-thribble the babbling day,
When bratticed wraokers are singing
aloud,
And the throngers croon in May.
EARNEST PENITENCE.
WE sincerely hope that the Russians will be kind and gentle with
the KUAN OF KHIVA. He may have erred, but surely he has now
not only made amends, bat has shown such a truly noble nature
that it would be cruel indeed to afflict him further, lie has released
the Russian prisoners. "That'« but a trifle," as the aristocrat lays
in King Lear, when he hears that "Edmund is dead, my lord."
Bat to show how earnest is his sorrow at having been misled into
offending Russia, the high-minded Kir AN has out off the heads of
ever so many of his own uncles and cousins, including his Premier.
He excels AETF.U cm WARD, who only said that he would make
almost any sacrifice for the good of his country—would sacrifice all
his wife's relations. The great KUAN may want a handle, but his
•word clearly wants none. We have rarely read of an instance of
more heroic conduct, or one in which a noble penitence was so man-
fully shown. We may add, that though a Khan's life has its
troubles, it has its compensations. Think of being able to extermi-
nate one's relatives, just as a sort of preliminary measure, before
entering seriously into details of business. The thought makes one
dance a Khan-khan.
SAFE, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
LAST Tuesday was the commencement of Easter Term. On that
day the LORD CHANCELLOR gave the usual breakfast to the Judges
and Queen's Counsel previously to going in procession to West-
minster Hall. The newly-appointed Judges were in attendance;
but a great legal officer, whose office is vacant, was conspicuous by
his absence, all the rather that there could not have been a more
particular occasion for his presence than that of the judicial and
forensic morning meal. But his place was supplied. More than
one learned partaker of that repast is understood to have poked hia
neighbour in the ribs, and pointing to a plate of appropriate comes-
tibles, to have whispered, grinning—" The LOBD CHANCELLOR for
the present takes the business of the MASTER OF THE ROLLS."
FASHIONABLE ARRIVAL.
Mas. MALAPROP has returned to the Caledonian Road, from Scot-
land. She has been spending the Easter Vocation with her friend
Mas. RAMSBOTHAU, in the Cossacks.

TO YOU, ONLY—SHE'S MY OWN!!"
I'D GIVE HEB
THE SONGS OF SPRING.
I LOVE to flee the sultry throng,
And roam the Solitudes among,
Rejoicing in the wild birds' Bong;
There, far away from the guffaws,
Am solaced by the mingled caws
And cackle of the rooks and daws:
Have many a time distinctly heard,
In singing, more than one small bird
A voice articulately word.
The Nightingale throws all away
A warning, meet for them that stray
In towns alone, and live on prey.
For, whether on the prowl, or snug
In pothouse, over pipe and mug,
They hear it not sing " Jug, jug, jug!"
That word to me suggests no fear
Of Prison, when it strikes mine ear;
But bids me think upon my beer.
A NOTE FOR NATAL.
THE subjoined telegram from Washington breathes
vengeance against a horde of murderous and treacherous
savages :—
"Profound indignation prorailn in the army and official oirclei
at the assassination of GENERAL CANBY. The PRESIDENT and
the Cabinet are deeply grieved, and unreservedly unction the
adoption of the severest measures of retribution. An immediate
movement of the troops on the Modocs has been ordered, and
then punishment will be complete and relentless."
Should this meet the eye of BISHOP COLXNSO, it may
suggest to him the question whether he should not have
thought twice or three times before entertaining an ob-
jection based on the extermination of certain races, and
urged by his inconvertible Zulu. But, in the interest
of humanity, Punch is sternly pleased to hear that the
savages have been driven from their "lava fortress,"
and that the American cavalry have had their innings.
ROME AND BOHEMIA.
BY accounts from Austria :—
"The provincial clergy of Bohemia have endeavoured to found a Roman
Catholic Bank at Prague, entitled the ' Bank of St. John,' the management
of which was to be exclusively in the hands of priest). The imperial authori-
ties have, however, declined their assent to the scheme."
It is difficult to imagine what particular objection the Austrian
Government can have had to a bank managed by Roman Catholic
ecclesiastics. The presumption would be, as to probity at least, in
favour of its reverend managers. On the other hand there is equal
difficulty in forming an idea of any special relation that can exist
between Roman Catholicism and banking, unless amongst people
whereof the Protestant bankers were generally rogues, and the
Jewish, for the moat part, no better. The only place which denomi-
nationalism has occupied in finance has hitherto been filled almost
entirely by gentlemen of the last-named persuasion; a small part
of it only having been held by Members of the Society of Friends.
Roman Catholic priests, turning bankers, would find themselves in
a position of express antithesis, if not antagonism, to a Community
in relation to whom they, by their own showing, were originally
Protestants. A bank in Bohemia, if the Bohemia were our own,
and not Austria's, would be a rather questionable concern, whether
its directors professed themselves Roman Catholics, Protestants, or
Jews. The Imperial Authorities cannot, to be sure, have con-
founded the idea of a Romanist with that of a Romany bank among
Bohemians. Some want of confidence, however, must have been
the reason why they refused to sanction the banking scheme of the
Bohemian Popish priests. The frustration of that project precludes
a question which might have arisen if they had permitted it. Would
the bank instituted by those reverend gentlemen have insisted on
the practice of crossing all cheques f

SOMETHING FOR SIR JOHN LUBBOCK TO DO.
EASTER-MONDAY was not a holiday for everybody, even in the
City. For instance, one of the papers, referring to what was hap-
pening on that day, announced that at the Mansion House the
Aldermen and principal officers of the Corporation dine with the
LOBD MAYOR, and afterwards attend Divine Service in Christ
Church, Newgate Street, where the 'Spital Sermon* will be
preached by the BISHOP OF SALISBURY." It must have been a
hard task for the principal members of the congregation to keep
awake, and pay proper attention to the Spital sermon, after par-
taking of the hospitality of the Mansion House, in which this year
there seems to be anything but a falling off. It is sad to reflect that
the Swordbearer, and the Secondary, and the Aldermen who have
passed the chair, may have been caught napping by a Bishop. For
a clear recollection of the discourse we can but look to the
Remembrancer. To prevent the possibility of unseemly conse-
quences, would it not be better in future that the dinner should
follow the sermon, instead of the sermon coming after the dinner f
An amendment in the Bank Holidays Act to this effect would prove
an immense relief to those meritorious persons whose annual duty
it is to spend part of their Easter Monday at church in Newgate
Street.
Historical.

Which no honest Yankee can read without blushing:
But, taken in joke, it is worth any money,
And " CALEB," we know, was the son of "G.

A RUMOUR has reached us that an influential deputation is about
to seek an interview with the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, with
a view to induce him to sanction (at the public expense) an expe-
dition in search of the Lost Tribes.

FASHIONABLE DEFORMITY.
ILL you, Ladies—
fashionable Ladies
—please to spare
two minutes of
your valuable time
to reading what was
said, the other day,
by ME. TEGET-
MEIER, before a
number of the
members of the
National Health
Society, who met
to hear him lec-
ture upon that de-
lightful subject—
Dress :—
"The outrageous
fashion of constrict-
ing the waist, and
thus altering the na-
tural form of the body,
"was the greatest evil
connected with female
dress. They had come
to look upon this
constriction almost as
natural, but it was in
itself a hideous de-
formity. Not long ago
he was talking to a lady, whose weight was about twelve stone, and she told
him that the size of her waist was eighteen inches; and he had measured
many of the villanous bands with which tbe female waist was bound, and
found that they did not exceed that size. Into a space, then, of eighteen
inches the lungs, heart, liver, and stomach—the four largest and most
important organs of the body—were to be compre«sed."
A joker might remark that a fashionable lady is like a strict
economist, because she makes a great fuss about a little waist. But
the practice of tight-lacing is too serious to be laughed about. It
can clearly be no joke to squeeze your heart, and lungs, and liver—
to say nothing of your stomach (think of that, ye Aldermen!)—into
a space that many a man with his two hands could span. Women
who, for fashion's sake, perform this hateful feat, are virtually
guilty of committing actual suicide, and deserve well to be buried
at four cross roads when they die.
But, Ladies, read a little further what was said upon the subject:—
"The system of tight-lacing was attended with the greatest possible evil.
Tbe heart could not act, consequently the circulation was impeded; and as
none of the organs were properly nourished, disease of the whole body here
and there took place. They got even the most visible effects of impeded cir-
culation. Women who tight-laced suffered from cold feet and got red noses.
(Laughter.) If they would only bear that fact in mind, it might have a
greater effect upon them than, perhaps, any consideration of health."
Here, one would think, is what should act as a deterrent from
tight-lacing, if the fear of even suicide should be found to fail of
doing so. Many a lady might consent to die a martyr to the fashion,
who would shrink from it in terror if she thought her nose would
suffer by it. Yet haply a red nose may, in course of time, be viewed
as a fashionable ornament, and love-songs may be written, by the
lovers of Mayfair, in the manner of the following:—
My love has got a red, red nose,
Like roses blown in June:
Her vital organs, clear it shows,
Are sadly out of tune.
My love has got a waspish waist,
A waspish temper, too;
Alack, she is so tightly laced,
The year she '11 scarce live through.
My love is like an hour-glass,
So slender is her shape:
Her sands of life full soon will pass,
Her grave's e'en now agape.
But ah I red nose, nor gaping tomb,
Are fearful in her eye;
Rather to health sans stays than come,
She '11 in the fashion die.
AN EASTERN SUBJECT.
WAFPINO seems a most unlikely place for a person of studious
habits to select as a retreat. Yet, amongst the pictures in the Inter-
national Exhibition at Kensington we find A Study at Wapping.
MOEE PUFFS WANTED.
OUR theatrical advertising friends give us very delightful, if
somewhat monotonous, reading, every morning. We are charmed
to think of " the still waters of the Thames rushing swiftly," we are
greatly comforted to know that though a fire is so tremendous to
behold there is no real danger, we are gratified with the sweet
English of the announcement that an eminent actor will appear in
the " dual roles" (which they are not, but the two parts) of Some-
body and Somebody else; and we are very glad to know that SHAK-
SPEARE'S comedy of Much Ado About Nothing is, in a Manager's
opinion, "sparkling."
But as this sort of thing has been served up for a long time, we
might petition for a little variety. Why do net the Managers imi-
tate another class of persons who push off drugs by means of puffing?
Let us have some testimonials to the efficacy of given dramas. Mr,
Punch is never ill-natured, and would not hurt anybody's feelings
for the world, so in giving an idea of what he means, he disclaims
the intention of alluding to any theatre in particular. The stars
forbid that he should make "uncalled-for remarks." But why
can't we have something like this ?—
THEATRE ROYAL, BLOOMSBURY SQUARE.
The Management is permitted to publish the following letter, the
original of which may be seen at the Box Office between 10 and 5—
fee optional: —
Sir,—I feel it my duty to bear sincere testimony to the merits of
your great and beautiful drama, The Serpent's Whisper. For nine
nighta I had enjoyed no sleep whatever. A friend advised me to
buy a box at your house. I did so, but with little faith in. the
remedy. Before the first Act was over, I was sleeping as soundly as
ever in my life, and I did not rouse till the box-keeper informed me
that the house was being shut up. Then I awoke, "bright as a
button." I have attended several times since, with the same happy
fortune, and I recommend The Serpent's Whisper to all my friends.
Make whatever use you please of this communication, and believe me
Your faithful Servant,
WIDGERY POFPS.
THEATRE ROYAL, HAMPSTRAD HEATH.
The following letter will speak for itself :—
Sir,—I have to thank you for adding a considerable sum of money
to my means. I had lately witnessed, at a rival establishment, the
performance of a piece called the Fiery Tombstone. A friend, who
accompanied me, betted with me, heavily, that this was the worst
play in the whole world. I took him to your theatre, where we
beheld the representation of your brilliant piece, the Boiled Owl of
Avernus. He instantly felt that he had lost, and signed a cheque
for the bet, while we were partaking of the charmingly warmed
soda-water ministered at your refreshment stall.
Yours very sincerely,
WILLIAM BUNKER.
THEATRE ROYAL, SALISBURY PLAIN.
Averse to self-praise, the Manager feels it a duty to give publicity
to this testimonial from a stranger :—
Sir,—Domestic details cannot be uninteresting to one who, like
yourself, is so successful with the domestic drama. It has been my
misfortune to unite myself in holy padlock with a lady who is of an
unsympathetic nature and a bitterly bad temper. We quarrel
terribly from morning to night. But we are sometimes conscious of
pur unhappy condition, and lament it. The other evening my wife,
in an unusually softened mood, observed that not a misery could be
added to our life._ I immediately ordered a cab, and took her to
your theatre, to witness your new burlesque, Strabismus: or, the
Winking Walrus of Westphalia. We endured it to the end, and.
as we returned in abject depression, we agreed that we had still
something to be thankful for. We are very wretched, but we
need not see your piece again, unless we like,—and we don't like.
Yours gratefully,
BARNABY FCDGE.
N.S.'lTo Managers.
The above suggestion is Registered, and any person using it with-
out Mr. Punch's sanction will be prosecuted with the utmost rage
and fury of the law.
Equality on Horseback.
IN connection with Women's Rights, it is whispered that a move-
ment is about to be set on foot amongst iair equestrians for the
abolition of side-saddles. Why not? How charmingly MRS. ROUSBY
looked as Joan of Arc mounted!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

ODD boys are always punctual
as to returning to school after
holidays. Members of Parlia-
ment are not, as a rule, bad
boys, but they did not muster
very strongly on this Monday,
April 2lst. The Lords came,
and sat for about forty minutes,
during; which they discussed
two measures in the interest of
those unfortunate little persons
•whom SIR FEAKCIS HEAD, in a
famous article in the Quarterly
Seview, made a young lady,
with long; carls, call Hilly
Jittiinitcs; those who, in MB. SAVAGE'S words,—
"Live to build, not boast, a generous race."
ME. GLADSTONE and four faithful colleagues appeared, like the knights in
the Ivanhoe tournament, to do battle against all comers; but the comers
declined to come up to any scratch.
So we soon got on ME. FAWCETT'S Dublin University Bill. He promised to
be quite amiable, and kept his word. He had made a sort of bargain with
Government that he should have their support if his Bill merely abolished Tests.
To that object he had therefore confined it, and he thought that the University
might be left to enact other liberal Statutes for itself. Mr. Punch congratulates
M it. FAWCETT on his wisdom and moderation, and would quote a new saying,
which has never yet appeared in print,—
"The better part of valour is discretion."
MB. MITCHELL-HENBY complained that Ireland had been much insulted in
former debates on the subject, and that her pulse had been caused to beat more
tumultuously than for many years past. We are bound to say that the outward
and visible sign of Irish wrath has not been lacking to the Hibernian organs,
and that their Belin'a Gate language has been of the strongest. Let us hope
that, in ME. MOOHE'S words, Ireland -will "feel that pulse no more." He
declared the test to be a small matter, it was Protestant "atmosphere" that
asphyxiated young Catholics. They cannot breathe where it is taught that an
eye on canvass cannot wink, and that the earth goes round the sun.
There was more speaking, but like Thersites (for once) Mr, Punch felt
inclined to say to the Irish lads, " Be silent, boys, I profit not by your conver-
sation." At last
MB. GLADSTONE expressed his approval of the Bill, although it was confessedly
of a limited character. He declared, however, that it would be a mockery to
contend that the measure was payment in full of the educational debt due to
Ireland. But the Government's business was now to take instruction from
others. Amendments being withdrawn, the Bill was read a Second Time.
We went into Supply, and MB. AYBTON was a good
deal catechised. He gave satisfactory answers, and
mentioned, inter alia, that the Works were restoring the
Monument to KING JOHN, in Worcester Cathedral. No
Hebrew Member had the bad taste to object, or to show
his teeth at the mention of the monarch whose odonto-
logical operations on the Jews are historically interesting.
ALDERMAN LUSK objected to payment for an unfinished
picture, the "Judgment of Daniel," but MB. ATBTOIT
explained that it could not yet be completed because it
had given sign of "swelling," and this probably satisfied
the worthy Alderman, who may have supposed that the
picture was getting bigger, and therefore more valuable.
It is still perfectly uncertain whether the Houses of
Parliament will fall to pieces, or not. MB. Aritro>- said
that we, or posterity, must wait and see.
That unlucky monument in St. Paul's to the DUXE OF
WXIXIKOTON came up again. The sculptor has been
painfully afflicted, so no more oan be said. But MB.
GOLDSET was right in remarking that at prefect all
that can be seen is a sort of dilapidated chapel, and
something like a chinmejr-piece. But the Duke can
afford, better than most great men, to wait for "storied
urn and animated bast."
Tuesday.—The Commons did an unusual thin*. MB-
AUBERON HEBBBHT wanted to introduce a Bill limiting
certain compensations to University Fellows. The House
would not even let him bring- it in.
Then we had a most "learned" debate OB Central
Asia, originated by MX. EASTWTCK, who laboured under
the disadvantage of knowing all about his subject, and
therefore could not be paradoxical and amusing. It is to
be regretted that dull topics are taken up by well-
informed men, who are too touch in earnest to be enter-
taining. However, we have not very often to make this
complaint. A jocose Member is a sweet boon, though
"Eter»»l nniles Ins emptincs* betray,
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way."
ME. GRANT Dri F was sarcastic on certain Russians
who dream of fighting England on the banks of the
Indus. There was no more cause for alarm now than
there was four years ago. He would watch Russia, but
remember the Spanish proverb—" Let him attack who
will, the strong man wins." MR. GLADSTONE expressly
declared that we had bound ourselves to nothing except
to use " moral force" with the AHEEB OF AFGHANISTAN.
Nobody supposes that a virtuous nation like England
will ever use immoral force, but, to adapt Sir Henry
Wildair's hint, the strictest morality will permit us at
need to use a sword of gold.
Wednesday.—It teems that legislation is necessary to
enableprivate persons to endow Canonries. MB. BERES-
FOBD HOPE kindly remedies the case. We own that we
should think a good many times before we endowed one,
and then that we should not do it, any more than we
should
"Endow a college or a cat."
But it is wrong that a benevolent wish should be hin-
dered of accomplishment. "Heaven save the founda-
tion" that has enabled authority to promote CHARLES
KINGSLEY to a Canonry at Westminster; and long may
he enjoy his well-earned repose
"In those deep solitudes and awful cells
Where each accomplishment with S I'.V.NLEY dwells."
Wednesday.—A Locomotives on Roads Bill was pro-
tested against by the HOME SECRETARY, and withdrawn.
MR. GBE&OBY justly declared such engines to be in-
truders, and to need restriction. But what's the use of
talking? Look at those detestable Tramways that make
a carriage drive into a suburb a service of actual danger.
Look at the Railway Vans that crush everything but one
another. Who thinks of persons who only desire to be
allowed to traverse London unharmed? Everything is
sacrificed to commercial greed.
Thursday.—LORD SBLBORNE has got his Judicature
Bill back again from the clutches of tbe Select Com-
mittee. There is a ohanee for it yet, if Members of the
House of Commons will make up their minds to leave
the discussion of such a measure to those who have
mastered the questions at issue. Let's have no Punch
and Judi-cature contentions.
MB. GLADSTONE was again questioned about the Oarlist
subscriptions. He somewhat qualified what he bad

he emphatically condemned the raising money for CHARLES THE
SEVENTH. Let us leave the Spaniard* to knock one another about

"The time shall come round
'When, mid Lord*, Dukes and Earls,

It was then proposed to go on with the Budgr-t, and the first
grievance wag that of the Brewers. After debate MB. GLADSTONE
said something which the chief malcontent liberally interpreted into
Soms fools in Nottingham stuck up a Republican placard. The
Chief Constable of the County, happening to see it, instinctively poked
his stick through it and destroyed, it. 'lis a sign of the times that
a gentleman in the House of Commons could complain of this, and
a worse sign that Mu. BRUCE, HEK MAJESTY'S Home Secretary,
could stand up and condemn the Constable's course. In this dis-
play of pedantic timidity, MR. BRUCE showed that he had forgotten,
if he ever knew, the role of law, that every man becomes a Constable
when he sees an offence committed. However, the loyal officer is
not to be dismissed this time, a public reprimand for being
incensed at an insult to his Queen being held sufficient by HEK

&c.—Mav-Day, the darling
theme of every poet from
CHATJCEH to GOWKH, the
favourite subject for the

tor's chisel, and the musi-
cian's grand pi ano, exercises
a mysterious influence over
events and circumstances
subsequent to it in. time
and date, according to the
day of the week on which
it falls. If the First of
May falls on a Sunday,
there will be more mar-
riages in the ensuing year
between bachelors and
spinsters than between
spinsters and widowers;
if it happens on a Monday,
the hens will lay through
the summer; if it occurs on
a Tuesday, the silkworms
should be looked to; if it takes place on a Wednesday, the black-
thorn will be in flower before the white-thorn; if, as this year, it
recurs on Thursday, heavy rain may be expected after sunset; if it
has the ill-luck to be contemporary with a Friday, all the goslings
will not grow up to be geese; and if Saturday is May-Day, search
should be made for a purse of money in growing grass, before the
ash is in full leaf.
Provided the weather is genial, and there is no snow lying on the
ground, and the wind is not in the East, and overcoats and sealskin
jackets can be safely left in their respective wardrobes, and the last
cold in the head has taken its farewell flight, the annual return of.
the month, of May, with all its associations and Meetings, awakens
recollections of home and youth and days gone by, of country
rambles and fresh-laid eggs and new-made butter, in the bosom of
the most hardened political economist, in the breast of the most cal-
culating statist, and in the heart of the most impassive woman of
the world. To listen to the song of the thrush, the nightingale; the
ik, the grosbeak, the hedge-warbler, and all the other primi-
jjerformers in the feathered orchestra; to gather the daisy, the
uiuibdil, the lesser celandine, the polyanthus, and the periwinkle,
in " the flowery meads of May:" to watch the harmless gambols of
the squirrel, the cricket, the field-mouse., and the grasshopper; and
to sally forth, with the first beams of the rising sun on May-Day
morning, with the avowed object of washing the face in dew, and
returning' home, heavily laden with odorous branches of perfumed
blossom, to a comfortable home and nice breakfast—these, next to a

good novel or an unexpected legacy, are Amongst the purest pleasures
that fall to the lot of those who are not insensible to the charms of
nature, and the solid advantages of a landed estate in the Midland
Counties.
Much might be written about the May-polo and its many endear-
ing associations, but, as Parliament is sitting, we have only, room to
enunciate one or two of its leading features. The last Census
showed that May-poles were still to be found lingering in thirteen
of the fifty-two counties into which England and Wales are mapped
out, resembling, in this particular, the hebdomadal divisions ot the
year. But incomplete returns were received from Dunstable,
Hendon, Mile'End, Maoolesfield, Nantwich, West Dray ton, Wigan,
and the Isle of Wight.
The descendants of the last surviving citizen and cordwainer,
who remembered looking out of his oriel window, and seeing the
Corporation of London dancing to the music of tabor and pipe and
the merry clash of the parish bells, round the M*y-pole which for-
merly reared its lofty head ("high as the mast of some tall
ammiral") on the verdant sward of Cornhill, are still to be found
pursuing their usual avocations; and tradition to this day (April
26th) fondly clings to the memory of that buoyant, light-hearted
Under-Sheriff, who specially distinguished himself by the way in
which he executed a galliard on the steps of the old Royal Exchange,
before business hours, "in the merry month of May" (SHAKSPEARE
or BASNFLBLD), long, long ago.
Much, too, might be said of Chimney Sweeps and Milkmaids, and
their participation in the mirth and merriment of May Day; of
QUEEN ELIZABETH going a-Maying wibh BACON and BTTRLEIGH; of
the Oxford Choristers, wno ascend the fair tower of Magdalen at
sunrise to sing their May-morn carol; of the arrival of the May-
flower on the shores of New England; and of May Moons, May
Marriages, May meetings, and May cleanings. ("For those old
Mays had thrice the life of these."—TENNTSON.) But the fullest
details on all such topics may be found in the papers and transac-
tions of those Societies (see. especially, the years 1811, 1826,
1834—5—6—7, and 1861, and the Supplement and Appendix) which
oast the regis of their protection over the manners and customs of a
time growing every day more and more remote from our own
bustling age, and destined, perhaps before the next decennial
Census, to fade away altogether into the vista of the illimitable
past.
Boon to Boniface.
THE recruits of the 1st Surrey Militia were, last year, instead of
being billeted in publio-honses-plaoed under canvass in the barrack-
yard by way of experiment. This experiment was found to answer
so well that it has been repeated this year, and the men are now
encamped at Richmond. The step of lodging Militiamen in tents,
if again successful, will perhaps be adopted as a permanent and not
a merely tentative arrangement.
A Vast Domain.
A FRIEND and Total Abstainer, who has hitherto been a great ad-
mirer of MILTON, feels his faith in that poet somewhat shaken, on
finding that he refers to the " Empire of Negus," without one single
word of disapproval.

A COUSINLY HINT.
"YES, AREN'T THEY?" "TALL ENOUGH FOE us TO BE MARRIED, / THINK!"
SUFFERERS AND SIGHT-SEERS.
WOHTHT MB. PUNCH,
"SPRING, Spring, ge-entle Spring!" I hear a cheerful
butcher-boy chirping at my doorstep, while I am seated shivering
over a winter's fire, and watching the hail pattering on the passing
umbrellas. The little warbler seems to me a trifle premature in the
selection of his song; still I cannot help remembering that May-Day
ia at hand, and the R.A.'s are prepared to exhibit their U-ray.
Springing thus from one of the Fine Arts to another—from
Orpheus to Apelles, if I may air my classics—perhaps I may be
buffered to jump to the conclusion that the Show this year will be
as popular as ever, and that the people who attend it will be as
pushing and unpleasant and impertinent as ever. Hinc ilia lacrt/ma.
I mean, here is the reason of my crying for year aid to reform the
ill-behaviour of the picture-seeing world.
If I may trust my memory of the miseries I have suffered in my
study of the Arts, there are at least ten distinct classes of obnoxious
persons, who have disturbed my comfort, if not trodden on my
toes:—
1. There are the civil people, who, when you are standing at just
the proper distance to appreciate a picture, coolly plant themselves
in front of you, and then back you from your place.
2. There are the pleasant people, who, by force of weight and
muecle, calmly shoulder you aside, and turn a deaf ear to remon-
strance if you think fit to give it vent.
3. There are the fashionable people, who come in all their finery,
and cause you ceaseless fear of being tripped up by their trains.
4. There are the stingy people, who will not buy a Catalogue, and
continually plague you by peering into yours.
5. There are the snobbish people, who affect to claim acquaintance
with half the lords and ladies whose portraits are exhibited, and
audibly proclaim their satisfaction with the likeness, or complain
that "her dear Ladyship" has been "anything but flattered" by
the artist of the work.
6. There are the wall-eyed people, who stick their noses to each
picture, as though they wished to smell it, and thus totally eclipse
it from everybody else.
7. There are the stupid people, who get puzzled by'the Catalogue,
and read out wrong descriptions loudly to enlighten their deaf
aunts.
8. There are the vulgar people, who, when a crowd is round a
picture, tell their cronies, blatantly, "Ah, it ain't so good as mine!"
or else, "I gave fire 'und'erd pound for it, and wouldn't take a
thou."
9. There are the clever people, who make unkind comparisons
of dead with living painters, and tempt you to believe that there is
nothing now worth looking at in all the range of modern Art.
10. And there are the gushing people (young ladies chiefly these),
who go into small raptures at every other second, and scream " How
sweetly pretty!" or, "0, isn't that too charming!" when they see
a scrap of millinery or a sentimental face.
If you could bind these harmful people not to break the peace of
; harmless people like myself, you would deserve to have your portrait
j painted for posterity by the first of living artists (you Know whom
1 mean), and would earn the lasting gratitude of yours truly,
IRACUNDUS.
P. 8.—As there are days reserved for Students at certain of our
Galleries, might there not be days reserved for Snobs at the Show of
the R A. P
PPS.— The charge on these days should be raised from a shilling
to a sovereign.
Woolwich. Nursery News.
MORE Woolwich Infants, yet unborn, are thought of. It is pro-
posed te construct, within the next year, no less than twenty of these
little strangers. They are to weigh thirty-five tons each, and carry a
seven hundred pound bolt propelled by a charge of one hundred and
thirty pounds of pebble powder, necessitating a cartridge of two
feet six inches long. There are reasons which have determined the
choice of that sort of gunpowder for the Woolwich Infanta; and it
is certainly more suitable than violet powder would be to those iron
babies.

OURSELVES AND OTHERS.

CCH ought we to thank goodness that we are
not ae foreigners are, nor even as these Ger-
mans :—
"BEEE RIOTS IK BADHX. — A serious riot ias
broken out in Mannheim, in the Grand Duchy of
Baden, arising from an increase in the price of beer.
A crowd, numbering about 6000 people, attacked and
destroyed to their foundations three great breweries,
and it was necessary to call in the troops before order was re-established."
So much from the Pott. What an admirable contrast to the frantic destruc-
tiyeness of those rampant Mannheimers, infuriated by a mere rise in the price
of beer, is presented by the patience and resignation
which we our noble selves have displayed under an
absolute prohibition of beer on Sunday afternoons; and,
not only that, but during an enormous increase in both
the price of the meat, which used to be the Englishman's
food, and that of the fuel which served to cook it, and
maintain the warmth necessary to his life. No increase
of the death-rate in Mannheim attended the dearth of
beer, as amongst ourselves it has that of meat and coals.
Yet where stood the butcher's shop, which a British mob
has razed, or the plant of a coal-owner, which a populace
of Britons has demolished? Moreover, have not the
Police Stations, the head-quarters of toe Force, inclu-
sive of spies and informers, instrumental to Sabbatarian
legislation in debarring a Briton of his beer, been
scrupulously respected by a law-abidiflg multitude, that
does not even throw stones and break windows? The
popular British Lion may rear in Hyde Park or Trafalgar
Square, but does only when he is poked up by agitators,
and even then (except bat once, when he pushed rails
down) his parti like that which Hulls/ Bottom want, d
to play, is " nothing but roaring." Only certain persons,
particularly prigs and extortioners, might as well con-
sider whether it may not be possible to exhaust the noble
animal's patience, and provoke him, one of these day s.
to a degree of fury that he will "tear the oat iu, and
make all split."
Protoplasm and Putty.
THERE is a great chasm
'Twixt live and dead matter;

IN the International Exhibition may be seen "The Domestic
Freezer." To many visitors this will be no novelty, the Domestic
Freezer being rather too well known in the domestic circle. Some-
times it is the Head of the Family who operates as a Domestic
Freezer, when the business transactions of the day have not been
altogether satisfactory, or dinner is late, or AUNT SABAH has written
to say that she hopes _to be with them on the 16th, to stay a month
or six weeks. Sometimes it is Mamma who is the cause of every-
body feeling chilly and uncomfortable— put out because the servants
have given warning, or the dressmaker lias spoiled her new silk, or
that projected visit to Batbinghampton is likely to come to nothing.
A daughter of the house has been known to perform the part of
Domestic Freezer, and generally in such instances a gentleman is in
the case— FREDERICK has omitted to write, or failed to come, or his
marked attentions to KM n. Y are not regarded with enthusiasm by
EM FLY'S parents. But more frequently it is the presence of a son in
the family circle which acts as a Domestic Freezer — when he has
exceeded his allowance, or is keeping late hours, or finds the billiard-
room more attractive than the counting-house.
The bore who takes a liberal advantage of his general invitation;
the mother of Mamma after she has had a difference with nurse on
the subject of the management of infants ; the enfant terrible of the
family with his inopportune remarks before strangers; and the
unsophisticated relative who will refer to passages in the early
career of COUSIN ROBERT, which he would prefer to have forgotten
— all these Domestic Freezers are additional proofs, if any were
wanting, that it is an everyday institution amongst us, and that
we need not go so far from home as the International to find it.

GENERAL COSTBERAS has been nominated to the command of the

CONFISCATION AND CONSCIENCE.
THE deputation of one hundred gentlemen from the National Anti-
Income Tax League, who waited on MB. GLADSTONE and the CHAN-
CELLOR op THE EXCHEQUER the other day, to urge the abolition of that
popular impost against which they, on behalf of the discontented
minority, who feel it, are banded, were of course "fubbed off," as
Mrs. Quickly says, with the usual courteous and evasive answer.
Neither the PREMIER nor MR. LOWE as yet sees his way to the pos-
sibility of doing without that valuable piece of class taxation.
Perhaps LORD NORTHBROOK could show them. He has discovered
it in India, and they also, if Englishmen were as Indians, would
too soon find it out here. You may take it as an axiom in fiscal (or
oonfisoal) science, that an exaction should, and must, and can, be
abandoned as soon as its collection ceases to be possible. One would
like to know how many Baboos have enriched the Indian Exchequer
with " conscience-money "?

Questionable, very!
Our Alderman's collars of Esses,
Turned Horse-collars, through Bow-bell-dom 1
MR. MAT'S stock of fancy dresses
On the backs of Civic swelldom!
Lord of Misrule and the Revels—
Ought a Lord Mayor to be it?
Is this keeping folks to their levels?
•Somehow, I don't teem to see it.
I've been in the habit of feeling
A great respect for Guy's.
With the Hospital I 've bad dealing,
"Which in the Borough lies.
Then, on the fifth of November,
Guys I hold an institution;
They 're as old as I can remember—
To stop 'em were revolution.
But Guys in the Corporation.
And the I.oi.n MATOB at the head of them!
Seems like trains running out of their station,
And into the train ahead of them.
Twenty jesters at once reads funny;
But they don't seem in place at Guildhall.
I can see mount* banking for money,
At the Wett End Egyptian Hall.
Where of broughams so long the rank was
To A. SMITH'S Mont Blanc crowding hotly;
But his mountain less of a blank was,
Than those twenty mugs in motley.
Once, callings used to be testers
Of what those who used them were best in,
But you 'd scarce say those Mansion-House jesters
I lad served their time to jesting!
I can see my Loan MA YOB presiding
At Courts and Commistions of shores,
But not, like a play actor, striding
About, dressed as Locus QUATOBZB.
That King was no fish out of water,
He didn't look small—but big;
To his Fletir-de-Lys mantle no martyr,
At home in his foil-bottomed wig.
"Vetai c'ett Sfoi," said that sovereign,
Which, for Louis Q.UATOBZE, was true;
But, in Midi a gilt-gingerbread covering,
"La Cite,"—my Lord—ain't you.
I like to see things in their places,
For then they don't cross and hurtle:
I like Aldermen saying graces
For lots of green fat in their turtle:
To see 'em standing up. manful,
For City rights and charters;
For these, o'er the coals, by the panful,
Game to be hauled, like martyrs:
To hear 'em each other schooling
In a Corporation quarrel;—
But I don't like to see 'em torn-fooling,
In other folks' apparel.
I respect my ideal Lord Mayor,
In my family I instil it—
Bow down to the Civic chair—
With something solid to fill it.
But Lord Mayors have no call to be funny,
Or learned, or wise, or witty—
Though in course they should have money,
And position in the City:
Should oe up to entertaining—
The chapter in Civic story !—
And subscribing, and sustaining
The City honour and glory.
Minor Mayors may invite—though a labour it is—
And noblemen, they 're our betters;
But as for dining celebrities
In sciences, arts, and letters,—
All such new-fangled notions
My ideal Lord Mayor must drop,
To Mammon confine his devotions,
In other words, Mind the Shop.
And as for maequing and mumming—
If cobblers should stick to their last,—
They may suit the Queer Time coming,
They don't suit the Good Time past!

Ministers themselves got fresh, that they would not
propose meat urcs to prevent other people from getting
tight.

MR. PUNCH presents his best compliments to MR. W. S. GILBERT,

his opinion was therefore, of course, immeasurably high. It begins,
"Sing for the garish eye" This composition he had supposed to
be new, and the work of the valued contributor who forwarded it
to him. It seems that aliquando bonus, etc. The contributor en-
closed it with some other papers, and in the accompanying note
expressly mentioned that it had been copied from a scrap-book, and
was remitted only for Mr. Punch's private diversion. This notifica-
tion is now before Mr. Punch, but had previously escaped his vigi-
lance. The East wind must have got into his eyes. The verses (with
some slight variations) are by MR. GILBERT, and appeared elsewhere
ten years ago. Mr. Punch had never seen them, or must have re-
membered anything so excellent. He is the soul of frankness,
honour, and good humour, and he hastens to say " Blunderavi";
yet can hardly regret having thus introduced MR. GILBERT'S poem
to a delighted universe.

BORN 1792. DIED AT CHELTENHAM, APRIL 27, 1873.
Is this the Actor's death? When into dark
Sinks the last spark of a slow-waning light,
Only the bedside watchers miss the spark
That quivered tremulously on the night.
The Actor's death is when he quits the Stage,
Whence he controlled the beat of many hearts,
Feeling and making feel more love and rage
Than falls to those who till more work-day parts.
Short life, perhaps, and shadowy —but sublime,
In those rare moments; when, for joy or pain,
Actors and audiences' hearts keep time
To music from some mighty master's brain.
A phantom being: but who dares to say
Our substance than their shadows is more true,
Their lampless night less bright than common day,
Who live, awhile, the life that SHAKSFEARE drew.
MACREADY dead! 'Twill point a paragraph,
Inspire a column—leave some acbing hearts;
But not an instant checks the light world's laugh,
As when an Actor from our stage departs.
He left his, many and many a year gone by;
And I who write must track, with backward thought,
Up to my youth, for the bright memory
Of all MACREADY acted, was, and taught.
He lived the life 'tis fitting they should live
Who commune with ideal thoughts and things.
To all he wrought his best brain loved to give,
Was cold to Fashion's smiles, stout 'gainst her stings.
Of high aim in his art, whoso dared preach
High art was folly, fool would bluntly call:
Still in his craft dared wider range and reach,
Until he stood it chief—confessed by nil.
He was content to shine, and store the gain,
With which success tempts men on downward ways,
But strove to make the theatre a fane
For noble art, e'en in ignoble days.
We were boys then, and, with young hearts aglow,
Followed his hand, that bravely led along
Through Prosperous glamour, Lear's colossal woe,
Hamlets brain-sickness, and Othello's wrong.
Answered like English, English HARRY'S call
Once more to Harfleur's walls; and for the stour
Of battle mustered round him one and all,
On the unequal field of Azincour.
Ah, those were brave times, when each season brought
Its stately tribute of good work, well done;
And kindred spirits at his bidding wrought,
To help the progress he had well begun.
What if no harvest, whose ears men can weigh.
Were housed from that spring-sowing P—fruit it bore,
And most of good our Stage can boast to-day
Came from his labour, who is now no more.
Hail and Farewell—thou last of a great line,
Who in ideal art moved as at home !_
Because ye bowed at a now empty shrine,
Was your faith false f Lo, the believers come!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAHIVA.RL
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
AMR Monday, April
28.—A. late MHS.
BBOWIC — now,
then, Madam,
why this levity
—we repeat, M KB.
SHOWN, a most
excellent Lady,
more worthy to
be mentioned here
than nine oat of
ten persons whose
names frequently
occur in these
columns, has left
£55,000 to pro-
vide hf tier bath-
ing-places for us
Londoners. But
as the money has
not yet reached
the Treasury,
MB. GLADSTONE
could not an-
nounce that any
steps had been
taken to carry
out the bene-
volent old Lady's
wishes. When
the first new
bathing-place has
been erected, Mr.
Punch means to
compose a clas-
sical inscription
for it, on the
model of that
placed by POPE
in his grotto.
"Nymph of the
Grot."
MB. W. H.
SMITH originated
a debate which
lasted through
two nights. His
resolution was
one for which
MB. GLADSTONE
hinted that MB. DMBAELI might have a feeling akin to parental fondness. It was that the
House would not proceed with the Budget, and reduce Indirect Taxation, until it knew Govern-
ment's intentions as to Direct Taxation. MB. SMITH supported his resolution in a speech
of calmness and ability, and said some very hard and just things about the Income-tax,
and the folly and vexatiousness of the way it was imposed and collected. He believed the
Budget to have been framed on a basis of inflation and high prices.
Then did MB. Lows assume a somewhat new character, at least one which he has not put
on during his Ministerial life. He blazed out. He went in for clap-trap, and talked about
"rich and poor," and declared that direct taxation fell on the former, indirect on he latter,
and that corresponding reductions should take place in both cases. He should be sorry to tie
his successor's Hands, as he meant to be his own successor. He had not neglected Local
Taxation. Then he abused the Opposition for asking relief for the poor at the expense of the
nch, and he complimented the working classes as being "neither saints nor idiots." Some
of us may remember that he did not at all times take so favourable a view of the artisans,
and that at a certain Reform period he used such strong language about the lower class that
their organs advised them to stick up his words in their workshops, and remember their
vituperator. But times alter, and so do situations, and we are not always looking forward
to a general election. The_ speech was a slashing one, and from a partisan point of view,
,, but the haughty cynic descended from his philosophioo-economical pedestal to serve
his party. However, when the Gods came down to fight on the plain of Troy, they used the
same sort of arms aa the mortals whom they knocked about so mercilessly.
"Full at the chief, above his coursers' head
From Mars's arm the enormous weapon fled—
Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance,
Far from the car, the strong immortal lance."
Snt STAFFORD NOBTHCOTE rose as Minerva, but even this cool sage rather lost temper at
the charges made by MB. LOWE. The latter had said that more Lies were told about Sugar
than about anything else, and SIB STAFFORD gently suggested that he should have said
Imaginary Statements, and that such language made gentlemen disinclined to criticise any
measure of the Government.
MB. TOBHENS hit out at MB. LOWE, and demanded a great extension of the area of rate-
able property. MB. KAVANAGH accused MB. LOWE of setting class against class. MB.
FAWCETT cut the Budget to pieces, but thought that it was too late to challenge it.

MB. GOSCHBN declined to reveal the Go-
vernment ideas on Local Taxation (of which
we were to hear on the following Monday),
and described Ms. SMITH'S Motion, which
was designed to force the Government hand,
as too clever by half.
MB. GLADSTONE wanted to finish the
debate at once, so we assumed that MR.
GLYN had been able to whisper pleasant
things to his Chief. But we adjourned.
Tuesday.—The LORD CHANCBLLOB intro-
duced what is apparently a most valuable
Bill for simplifying and cheapening the
transfer of land. LORD CAIRNS was pleased
that the subject had been revived. For
those
"Whose freehold's in a garden pot,
And hardly worth a pin,"
the topic has not much interest; but let
those who have ever bought or sold real
property tell us what sort of language they
used on looking at the Solicitors' bills; yet,
mind, the Solicitor is not overpaid for what
he has to do under the existing system of
Conveyancing.
LORD CLAUD HAMILTON brought on a
proposition that the Railways of Ireland
should be acquired by the State. MB.
GLADSTONE saw many difficulties in the
way of this, but he treated the Irish in an
indulgent sort of style, and had a plan for
lending money to the railways at a lower
interest than they now pay, and by this,
and by another device of his, they would
gain £130,000 a-year. "We rejoice to say-
that "a generous and grateful people
dashed back so insulting a boon at the head
of the Saxon Minister. MB. DELAHUNTZ
declared that he would not touch it with a
pitchfork, and laid all the miseries of his
country at the door of the Dublin Castle
officials, who made her laws. "We don't
come among you as beggars," cried MR.
DELAHUNTZ. "Abolish Dublin Castle,
raise the equal flag, and Ireland will go
ahead like a house afire." He also men-
tioned that he wanted England and Soot-
land for the Irish. It was very diverting
to those who like Irish farce, but when we
want this kind of thing we prefer to see it
in MR. BOUCICAULT'S and MB. FALCONEB'S
clever dramas. In the end, the Motion of
LOBD CLAUD was defeated by 197 to 65.
Much more interesting than the clamour
of wild geese was an appeal for protection
to certain other wild birds. MR. A. HEB-
UKKT got a Select Committee to look after
some that had been excluded from the Act
of 1872. "The amiable and accomplished
Jhaffinch," the Thrush, and the Blackbird,
are to be thought of, and we are not with-
out hope of putting down the Sparrow
murderers, the most insensate Clowns in
ixistenoe. It was a case of " the Bird and
VIany Friends," only in the right sense, for
the Committee was granted by 162 to 16.
"Birds in their little nest agree
That 'tis a pleasing sight
To see great gentlemen agree
To do our Warblers right."
Wednesday was given to the Ladies.
VI it. JACOB BBIOHT moved the Second Read-
ng of the Bill for doing away with their
Disabilities—for giving them Votes, in fact.
tt would enfranchise about 300,000 feminine
•sons. We had, he said, a Queen whs
lad showed the greatest tact and judgment
n a late crisis—why should not other ladies
exercise political sway? Women were
much better people than men, and behaved
idmirably in all social and moral relations.
MR. EASTWICK, in the gentlest and plea-
santest manner, seconded the Motion, and
:ven urged that in war times women were
braver than men.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARL
MB. BOTTVEBIE, of course, objected to turning Women into
Men. The former were physically weaker, and therefore could
not undergo equal fatigue. (Beleakins, as we say in Lanca-
shire, MB. BOCVKUIE can never have shared the severe enjoy-
ments of a London season.) He made the usual jokes about
female Members of Parliament, about an Attorney-General eloping
with a Solicitor-General, and about a Prime Minister being laid up
with a baby (are Prime Ministers never laid up with the gout P), and
he gave us the rest of the cheap and aged satire customary on
such occasions. MB. LBATHAH, too, opposed the Bill, and objected
to the creation of the monster called Femme-homme. His picture
of a blooming and engaging First Commissioneress of Works, how-
ever, made the House laugh.
I.nun JOHN MAOTTEBS, always all chivalry, stood up for the
Ladies, and made one good point. If the Ballot were the guarantee
for order, quiet, and seoresy that it had been represented to be, what
difficulty was there in the way of feminine voting P
MB. BBUCB was unusually vigorous against the measure—timid
men are generally most afraid of women, unaware that
"Woman, born to be controlled,
Stoops to the haughty and the bold."
All through the history of mankind a broad distinction had been
made between man and woman,—no country had yet conceded femi-
nine suffrage—in a House whose Members had wives, sisters, and
daughters, their interests were sure to be looked after, etc., etc.
Indeed, so feminine was MB. BRUCK'S logic that it did seem to make
the presence of more orators of the kind unnecessary, and so he did
mischief to the Bill.
MK. BEBESFOKD HOPE hit straighter, though not so politely, and
had a pleasant word for cliques of noisy, and disagreeable, and strong-
minded women, who he thought led the agitation in the matter.
MB. FAWCBTT, of course, supported the Bill, and said that though
women were generally Conservatives, and would certainly hinder the
destruction of the Church of England (which he desired) that was
no reason for refusing them justice.
MB. K NATCH BULL-Hue; ESS EN objected to sarcasm on the question.
But Providence had assigned different duties to men and to women.
This is not quite exhaustive. On both sexes is imposed the pleasant
duty of reading MB. K. H.'s charming story-books, and we wish
he M write more of them.
MB. H KM.KY had previously been on the side of the—Men, but he
had seen reason to go over to that of the Angels.
MB. NEWDEGATB was very, very sorry to hear this. He protested
against the Bill as a declaration that men were unequal to the per-
formance of their own duties.
SiK JOHN TBELAWNY quoted ever so much out of LIVT, in the
original, against women, which would have been rather mean, but
that most ladies understand Latin better than officers, schoolboys,
and " self-made men."
MB. 0HEKKK told the old story about the woman who had no
"coals of fire " to heap on her husband's head, and so took boiling
water, and he seemed to think that this would be the course in a
family where the head of the house did not please his ladies by
voting with them. After this descent no more could be said, and
the Bill was thrown out by 222 to 155: Majority against Woman. 67.
One story might have been told in regard to the proposal that,
when a woman married, she should lose her vote. A Scotchman
made an offer of marriage in the most cheerful style. He conducted
his love to the kirk-yard, and pointing out the graves of his own
family, said tenderly, "Lassie, would ye like to rest with them t"
A somewhat less doleful form of offer, in case of the above arrange-
ment, might be, "BELINDA, darling, say, will you be disfranchised
for the sake of your ALPHONSO P"
Thurtday.—LOBD SELHOKNE'S Judicature Bill was "improved,"
contrary to his wish. An alteration by LOBD CAIBBS was adopted,
purporting to uphold the pre-eminence of the LOBD Cn ANCELLOK.
LOUD SELBOBBE is a Medea in a new light. He takes the two ugly
little children—Law and Equity—and tosses them into a cauldron,
wherein he proposes to fuse them, and to bring out a perfect Angel
of Justice. Their respective friends are making a most intolerable
row about the operation, and Mr. Punch imputes no more inte-
rested motive than Patriotism to the demonstration against the
measure. But it is certain that those who are most displeased with
it are most likely to lose by it.
One of MB. PKTEB TAYLOA'S "grievances"—the case of a culprit
who was said to have received extra punishment for laughing in the
dock, was explained, and of course, exploded. The fellow had
frequently been guilty, but while his poor old mother paid his fines,
he jeered at justice, which has finally given him something which
he does not laugh at.
We then resumed the adjourned debate on MB. W. H. SMITH'S
Motion on the Budget. The House was not well attended during
the early debate, and the speakers could not be very cheerful.
However, it was known that the Leaders meant to have a round or
two, so we picked up about ten. COLOKEL AMCOTTS mentioning
that he intended " to speak truth and shame the Evil One," was
assailed with a cry of "Name!" Ma. BENTINCK walked out of the
House, displeased that the SPEAKER would not hear him instead of
MB. DISKAKI.I.
The Leader of Opposition made an elaborate speech in support of
the Motion, and was full of information about Local Taxation.
But this was not nearly so interesting as his mode of paying back
MB. LOWE for certain taunts. He was able to take a cheerful view
of MK. LOWE'S extraordinary speech—it was a specimen of the
juvenile ardour of some primitive assembly. "Everybody had not
had the good fortune to have travelled in the Antipodes. Trans-
late this—we shall not—and you will see what it meant. He pro-
posed that MB. LOWE should do as he had done before, take back
his Budget, and try to make it better. Speaking of the duties on
liquor and tobacco, MB. DISKAELI informed the House that he
neither drank spirits, nor smoked. We may concede to SIB HENBY
THOMPSON that spirits are bad for most people, but
"Divine tobacco, that from east to west,
Sootues the Turk's labour and the Tartar's rest!"
We cannot hear with pleasure that the friend of 8n>OHiA partaketh
not of the fragrant _weed." as it is profanely called. We had
imagined him, lentut in umbra, watching the narghile, and devis-
ing the epigram. Same pensive regret comes onus to learn that
MB. DISK AKLE has given up smoking. He made, however, an effec-
tive speech.
It was answered as effectively by the other, "war's perfect
master." Ma. GLADSTONE defended the Budget, and dwelt on the
great boon to the working man from the remission of the Sugar-
Duty—£750,000. But for this Motion the plan of Government as
to Local Taxation would then have been before the House. If
Ma. LOWE had said that all the direct taxes fell on the rich, the
indirect on the poor, it was a gross exaggeration, but MB. GLAD-
STOKE said he had not heard this. But it would have been unjust
not to remit as much taxation of the poor as we remitted of that on
the rich. He trusted to the House to fulfil the dictates «f justice.
Both Leaders declared, with profuse emphasis, that they would
not shrink from a division. Doubtless they would not have done so,
but no division was taken. To the Liberal shout of "Ay," the
Opposition gave not one answering " No." And there was an end
of the matter. This debate, with such a result, has been rather
good for the Ministers.
Friday.—We sat very long in the Commons. After it had been
admitted that England had been "put in a hole" in the 8. Juan
business—we having accepted unfair terms of arbitration because
the Americans would not consent to fair terms, we went into Supply,
and supplied away till two in the morning.
FOLLIES OF THE FASHION.
HO is it that sets the fashions?
Whom have we to thank for all
the hideous excrescences by which
beauty is distorted and comfort
is disturbed P Passing periwigs
and pigtails, as things happily
extinct, we wonder _ who invented
chignons, corsets, stick-up-collars,
chimney-pot hats, and high-
heeled boots.
As regards these last-named
instruments of torture, see here
what is said of them by somebody
who knows :—
"It -was impotrible to imagine a
more depraved form of foot covering,
or one more injurious, than the high-
heeled boots now worn by many
women. The fire toes were crumpled
up together, and a greater weight than
it was ever intended it should Dear was
thrown upon the ball of the great toe,
rendering long-continued muscular
exertion a thing impossible."
Fine ladies may declare that
fine ladies have no need of under-
going a continuance of muscular
exertion, and that they therefore
have no need to give up wearing high-heeled boots. Of course, fine
ladies keep their carriages, and, except perhaps in dancing, never
have occasion for stretching their ten toes. So they let these be
deformed and crumpled up by high-heeled boots, and grow mis-
shapen and distorted like the feet of the Chinese. Deformity
becomes a proof of fashionable breeding, and it is better to be
hideous than not dress d la mode.

NAPOLEON m EXCELSIS.
IT is very well known that, during: the late French Empire, the
celebrated Medium, MB. D. D. HOME, enjoyed the patronage of
NAPOLEON THE THIRD, and used to hold seances before his Imperial
Majesty at the Tuileries. In connection with this matter of historical
fact, there seems a peculiar significance in the following passage of
Louis NAPOLEON'S recently published will :—
"II fnut penser que du haul del cieux oeux que roua arez aim4> TOUI
regardant et roua protugent. ('rat lYuur de mon grand onole qui m'a
toujouis inepir^ et aoutenu. II en (era de meme pour man nil, car il sera
toujoun digne de son nom."
Perhaps the Nephew learned that he was inspired from Heaven
by the soul of hia Uncle from raps which occurred in the presence of
MB. HOME. These, however, have proved untrustworthy, and are
not to be depended on. Therefore we cannot confidently express
the hope that NAPOLEON THE THIRD (who avenged Waterloo by
doing good offices to England) may have rejoined his Uncle. We
wish we could. The assurance that NAPOLEON THE FIRST had gone
aloft would be cheering. In that case, who would need to be afraid
of haying to go elsewhither? He is in an abode which contains the
majority, if not all, of the majures. Among them must be nearly,
if not quite, every man Jack of the hundreds of thousands whom he
sent thither from the battle-field— besides the Due D'E.vti HIKN in
cold blood.
In another part of the late EMPEBOR'S testament he expresses,
with reference to the PRINCK IMPERIAL, the desire :—
"Qu'U n'oublie jamaii la devise du chef de notre famille, ' Tout pour It
"'
It may be doubted if the Third NAPOLEON understood this motto
exactly in the sense in which it was practised by the First, it*
Author. A proverb says that, " le pert de famille eit capable de
tout." So was the Chief of the NAPOLEON family. In his mind did
not " Tout pour le Peuple Francois" simply mean '' Anything to
be Emperor of the French." Nevertheless, the ability to believe
that he is now in a better place than even the Tuileries would be
satisfactory, because reassuring.
RIDICULE OF WOMAN'S RIGHTS.
THE suffrage both Man 'a right and duty
You hold, and yet deny to Beauty.
(Women in general so we call—
Some having more, some less, that's all.)
With just above an idiot's brains,
That men should vote you 've taken pains;
To poll admit the multitude
Of fools: the sagest dames exclude.
You have enfranchised each male ninny.
Is Jackass so much more than Jenny f
Yes, men of lofty politics,
For you, because your Jackass kicks;
Whereas poor Jenny does but bray;
So can be safely answered "Nay!"
Say, you whose theory supposes
The rule of right is counting noses,
And who, in point of worth, opine
That snub's as good as aquiline,
The petit nez retrousse, too,
Of less account is that to you,
Why, than the gross plebeian pug
Of tinker Snout or joiner Snug t
Are women in your sight as mud?
Are they not, too, your flesh and blood?
Hard. Case.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

NIP'S NOTES;
Theatrical Nippings. From the Lyceum to the Strand, from the
Strand to the Optra Comique, thence to the Vaudeville.
NOM BER NIP was a fami-
liar. So am I, only not too
much ao. I observe the
caution, "Be thou familiar,
but by no means vulgar."
Being eager to go every-
where, in order to Keep you,
my Master, and your friends
au courant with what is
going on — (and, indeed,
you must now-a-days be
on the run, when nothing
is at a standstill)—being
eager, I say, to go every-
where, and stay nowhere,
I nip into a place, and nip
out again,—fly here, fly
there,—I should say, cab
here, cab there, and see
what is to be seen from
one end of London to the
other. Among the theatres,
I have recently visited the
Lyceum, the Strand, the
Vaudeville, and the Op$ra
Comique, whereon I have
the following remarks to
offer.
Every playgoer will, of
course, at some time or other, treat himself to MR. Iuv ING'S per-
formance of Eugene Aram at the Lyceum. Eugene Aram, how-
ever poetically idealised, was, in fact, but a Eugene Aram-soarnm
sort of a fellow. He was a hero of the Newgate Calendar. He
murdered a man for his plate, wrote half-a-dozen lines of indif-
ferent versification, and met a fate that CINN\ might have expe-
rienced, had "d la lanterne," instead of " tear him," been the cry
in the time of the Roman poet, whom Eugene resembled, only
inasmuch as they were arcades ambo, or Sinners both.
Beautifully put on the stage under the direction of MB. BATE-
MAN, Eugene Aram is an nndramatio play, but a dramatic poem.
Its leading idea is but the ringing of one change on The Bells.
In the latter, Mathias had murdered a Polish Jew: and fear and
remorse killed him. In the present play, Aram has murdered a
scoundrel (not a Polish Jew), and fear and remorse kill him. In the
last Act of The Bells, Mathias showed in pantomime how he killed
the Jew: in the last Act of the present piece, Aram shows Miss
ISABEL BATEHAN, who has rather a dreary time of it throughout,
how he killed the scoundrel.
As for the language of the poem, it is, doubtless, excellent; but
more than one visit is necessary in order to form an opinion of its
literary merits. Were the book published, the more satisfactory
method would be to read it first, and then see it played.
One thing more. The Bells, to which it bears so striking an
affinity, was called a " Psychological Study." This is not so styled,
though it ought to be. Now, Sir, I submit that the stage is intended
for Plays, and not for " Psychological Studies." Hamlet is, himself,
a psychological study; but he is the central figure of a strong play.
So of Macbeth, so of Othello. However, there is the piece, and as it
is, not as it isn't, we must all pronounce upon it. The verdict will
decidedly be in favour of MB. HF-NKT IRVING's performance; but I
sincerely trust that with this second " study" of "murder as one of
the fine arts" will terminate what threatens to be "The Bells
series." If murder will out in this psychologically-stagey way, then,
instead of blessing the Bells, play-goers will be exclaiming, with
Mrs. Gamp, " Drat them Bells," and>o will MB. IRVING. The
piece is completely successful, and has, up to the present time,
attracted more attention than either of its predecessors.
After Eugene Aram, enliven yourself with Nemesis, a niece of
musical buffoonery at the Strand, and one of the funniest, brightest,
and most extravagantest packs of nonsense that this little Theatre
has had since—well, no matter since when—let me say, generally
and vaguely, since the last
There is not a dull bit of music in it, and though there is no par-
ticularly brilliant vocalisation, yet, as all the singing is well acted
(which is nearly everything in this sort of thing), and as the people
fit the parts, and the parts the people, it all goes with spirit.
Over the way at the Opera Comique, MBS. GEORGE HONEY, Miss
PATTT LAVKRNR, Miss CARXYLE, and the numerous dramatis
personee, do their very best with the bright music of the rather too
long Bohemians. There are excellent things in it, but for fun it
is some way behind the general run of Operas Bouffes. Costumes
and scenery, brilliant. Sinking, capital.
Finally, for a genuine bit of comedy, commend me to the per-
formance of MB. FABREN as Sir Peter Teazle, and MB. CLAYTON as
Joseph Surface, in the celebrated Screen Scene in the School for
Scandal. It has run for over two hundred nights; and, were it
acted all round now, as perhaps it was at first, and as it still is by
the two gentlemen above mentioned, it would not "surprise me
to hear." at some future time, that it was celebrating its _four
hundredth representation to a crowded house. Played as it is,
the advertisements ought to announce that the Screen Scene com-
mences punctually at such and such an hour, and add the time of
its finish. This would draw the latest diners, while the earliest
would have their full six-penn'orth. I make no charge for this
valuable bint, and remain your own familiar,
NIP.
FOUR BOB.
THE policy of ROBIN HOOD was not, MR. ROBERT LOWK, exactly
what you represented it in your remark on the proposal to reduce
Direct Taxation rather than the Sugar-Duty:—
"It is reversing the policy of ROBIN HOOD—stripping the poor to feed the
rich."
Why not be accurate? It was, you know, the policy of ROBIN-
HOOD not merely to strip the rich, but worse, to rob them. ROBIN-
HOOD subjected the rich to a pocket-tax. With part of the proceeds
of this direct taxation he bribed the poor to support him. This,
you see, MB. ROBERT, was, as it were, sugaring the poor. Would
not reversing the policy of ROBIN be something like reversing the
policy of ROBEBT f What's in either of those two names to differ-
ence them; do they npt accord in the first syllable; and is not BOB,
politically and financially, in the fullest sense equivalent to ROB F
Recollect, there were two noted ROBS—ROBIN HOOD and ROB ROY.
The English ROB robbed the rich, as you should have said, to give
to the poor, so that he might curry favour with the latter. The
Scotch ROB levied black mail—on privileged classes, look you—and
wouldn't he have made a famous Chancellor of the Exchequer F As
to another illustrious ROB or BOB—long life to him, and— de vivis
nil nisi bonum.
You do not say much to discredit the policy you so cleverly mis-
represent when you declare that—
"Such a policy will be an injustice to the sugar trade, which would,
while these battles were going on about local taxation, be hung up between
heaven and earth."
Well; in that case would not Society be well rid of a great many
fraudulent grocers? In the meantime, MB. ROBERT, you coolly
assume it to be an incontrovertible fact that the payers of direct
taxes consume no sugar. Now—not again to mention the two
BOBS already referred to in connection with a name that makes a
third—is not that rather too much like a fourth BOB—ROBERT

I DON'T INTEND 10 HURRY,
OUR WHISPERING GALLERY.
WE are in a position to contradict the rumour which has lately
been gaining ground, that in consequence of the daily increasing
demand for fresh fruit and vegetables in the Metropolis, MB. AYHTON
has decided to convert a large portion of Kensington Gardens into
Market Gardens.
There is no foundation for the report that MR. GLADSTONE is suf-
fering from harassing doubts as to the personal existence of HOMER,
and the authenticity of the popular accounts of the Trojan campaign.
We have reason for believing that MR. LOWE has no intention of
submitting to Parliament a supplementary estimate for the estab-
lishment and maintenance of a National School of Cookery.
A little bird has just whispered in our ear, but we cannot vouch
for its being well informed, that the leading supporters of the
Women's Wayward Movement are about to abandon their native
snores, and St. James's Hall, and MK. BOUVKRIK and MR. LKATHAM;
and form a new settlement in one of our Transoceanic Colonies-
Ma. JACOB BRIGHT to be the President of the Community, pro tern.,
until the Ladies have settled among themselves which of them has
the best right to take the lead.
A statement has gone the rounds of the Press, but we understand
without sufficient official authority, that the SHAH OF PERSIA,
during his approaching visit to this country, will be invited to lay
the foundation-stone of a new wing to a well-known and popular
public Institution, with fall Masonic honours, a Municipal address,
a procession of five hundred young ladies, dressed in the height of
the folly of fashion, to deposit purses of gold at his slippers, and a
luncheon after the ceremony in the nearest Town Hall.
A rumour is afloat, but we cannot trace it to its source, that a
healthy young sea-serpent is expected at Whitsuntide at the Brighton
Aquarium; and that at the Crystal Palace an elegant chamber (in
the Kuckoco style) is in preparation for the reception of a mermaid
of prepossessing appearance and fascinating manners, now on her
voyage to this country from the Cannibannahan Seas.
The report that a large number of Equity Barristers are about to
present the LORD CHANCELLOR with a full-length portrait of him-
self, holding the Judicature Bill in his right hand, seems to require
corroboration.
The news seems almost too good to be true, that the Royal
Academy have decided, after this year, to hang all the portraits in
a room by themselves, to be conspicuously labelled "Portrait
Room," and to which there will be no additional charge for
admission.
It is whispered in the Club* that the future position of this
country with regard to the oyster is likely to engage the attention of
the Cabinet before next season. The question is one which cannot
long be shelved.—No epigram about shelv-fish implied.
Great excitement has been caused in the House of Commons by a
report that the Government have serious thoughts of not adjourning
this year for the Derby Day, but intend to add an. additional holiday
to the Whitsuntide recess, by way of compensation.
We regret to announce that, after the most searching investiga-
tion, we nave failed to meet with anybody who sate the Members of
the Metropolitan Board of Works twining garlands of flowers round
the lamp-posts on the Thames Embankment, on the morning of the
First of May.
It is whispered that the first stone of the new Courts of Justice
will not be laid until PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR is of an age to take
the chief part in public ceremonials.
We must leave it to our listeners to say what reliance they think
is to be plaoed on the assertion that Government intend to delegate
to a Royal Commission, with its head-quarters at Greenwich, the
delicate task of settling the long-pending question—What is a
whitebait?
A rumour has reached us—we give it for what it is worth—that
through the liberality of the great City Companies, all the London
Bridges will be thrown open, toll free, after the 31st of March next.
A project is said to be on foot for forming a Company to supply
the streets at the West End of London, during the season, with
scented water. The carts to be elegant and ornamental in_ their
structure, to revolve on noiseless wheels, and to be fitted up with an
ingenious musical apparatus, by means of which a selection from

Yon world of splendour, Madam:
They manage matters better there
Than we, the race of ADAH.

Which ns are apt to seize on;
Because they have their feelings all
Subordinate to Reason.
Their earth includes no battle plain,
Renowned in song or story;
For knowledge is their only gain:
No thought have they of glory.
No martial hero there they know,
Low knave, or lofty plotter;
No soldier hath his scars to show;
His stripes hath no garotter.
Folk act for ends which meet they think,
Regardless of sensation;
On principle they eat and drink,
And not from inclination.
Their bodies, which, unto their souls,
Mere engines, ruled by thought, are,
They stoke with food as though with coals;
Turn liquors in like water.
No rivalries are ever bred,
In that wise world, by Beauty.
For there, too, people only wed
Because it is their duty.
Herein the wisdom of their law
Transcends e'en all Egyptian;
The lot of marriage husbands draw,
Wives also, by conscription.
Hence, on that whole resplendent globe,
There's not a single nation
Which will be stripped of Nature's robe
By over-population.

Would we, supreme upon its throne,
Likewise, establish Reason.

Another new tripos (Athletic Exercises) is spoken of as being in

considered by Convocation at Oxford.
HOMO CAUDATUS.
IN the course of bis admirable oration in Castronem, HAWKINS,
Q.C. (we do not say Ma. CICERO), thus bespoke the Jury :—
"You know that the £100,000 upon the Tichborno eetates was not touched
by the will at all. The settlements had done that. But the Defendant, when
questioned as to the general object of the will, laid it was to ' create a reserve
fund by entailing my father.'"
This quotation was followed by " great laughter;" after which
our learned friend proceeded:—
"There is a distinguished conveyancer behind me (Mil. CHAPMAN BAH HER)
who might pomibly make me understand how that could be done, but he
would be a long time about it."
A distinguished Naturalist could, perhaps, easily elucidate in a
few words what it would task a distinguished Conveyancer to ex-
plain in many. Has not the Author of the Origin of Species entailed
his ancestors P If you want to know how to entail your father, ask
MR. DABWDT.
Elegance with Economy.
MADAM, von pinch your waist so tight
As to shock all men in their senses;
Your husband still yon could delight:

THE GOLDEN LAND.
TEX true Tom Tiddler's Ground must clearly, one would say, be
near the Bank of England. And what a lot of gold and silver must
be constantly picked up there, when we find the land is purchased
at the price which we here quote :—
"Tm VALUS or Cm LAND.—Premises in Coleman Street (once a lead-
ing thoroughfare of the City, but since the opening of Moorgate Street not so
much used), with an area of about 2,000 feet, were yesterday sold at a sum of
£12,000, being at the rate of £6 per foot, the largest sum, we believe, yet
obtained at this spot."
Six pounds per foot 1 This 'well-nigh beats the diamond-fields.
Fancy owning a few acres of land which may be valued at six
pounds for a foot! Well, in spite of all one hears about the deca-
dence of England, there is certainly small fear of her prosperity
decreasing while her soil is thought worth purchasing at ten shillings
an inch.
RUSSIAN HIDES.
OUR by no means remote ancestors used to account the Russians,
whom they called Muscovites, barbarians, little better than down-
right savages. Henoe they would have been prepared to misinter-
pret a telegram, concerning the EMPBBOB WILLIAM'S visit to St.
Petersburg, which concludes with the statement that:—
"This being the birthday of the CZAR, the town is decorated in a festive
manner. The streets are filled with joyous crowds. In the evening there
will be a grand tattoo."
Thanks to the vast increase of intercommunication with our
neighbours, which has been effected by the marvellous instrumen-
tality of steam, we are, happily, far too wise to understand that, in
Russia, tattooing themselves, after the fashion of South Sea
1 slanders, is one of the manners and customs of the natives.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE STAGE AND THE PULPIT.
Oir the afternoon of Sunday last week the REV. PROFESSOR
LIOUTFOOT, Canon of St. Paul's Cathedral, preached, at St. James's
Church, Piccadilly, a sermon which, from a published summary of
it, appears to have been an altogether awakening discourse, and not
one of that numer-
ous kind by which,
on the contrary, a
narcotic effect is pro-
duced on a congrega-
tion. The subject of
it was "The Drama,"
whereon the preacher
spoke as to wise men,
and not to sanctimoni-
ous fools or gloomy
hypocrites. He told
them that it "was an
enormous and power-
ful instrument in the
hands of Society—an
engine for good or for
evfl," and that :—
"Its popularity would
inevitably secure for it
a great influence, and
he thought that the
Drama should be en-
couraged, and hearty
sympathy with it ex-
pressed for all its noble
efforts. It should be
raised up and made what
God would have it made,
to purify the moral
sentiments, to be the
common educator of the
people in all that was
heroic, j ust, pure, lovely,
and of good report."
And, he asked,—
"What was there to
prevent the English
ttage from taking its
proper place BO as to
inculcate all that was
healthy in morality in
the hearts of the
people?"
Nothing, to be sure,
in the nature of the
Stage itself :—
"But the preient
state of the Drama was
far from satisfactory;
all honour, then, to
ihose dramatic writers
and stage managers who
were attempting to raise
it by not pandering to
the vitiated tastes of
some of the public."
The Stage, well
conducted, would be
auxiliary to the Pul-
pit—that well con-
ducted too. For if
the state of the Drama
is unsatisfactory, so,
in general, is not that
of the Sermon? If
the former is, in some
instances, immoral,
is not the latter, in
very many indeed,
unpractical; and is
frivolousness on one
hand not matched by
imbecility on the other? Many sermons are light as the lightest
literature, adapted to the meanest capacity by levity consisting in
the mere absence of thought.
CAXOX LIGHTFOOT'S discourse, above quoted, may be ominous of
better things for both Stage and Pulpit. Relating to a matter of
practical interest, with moral and spiritual bearings, it is calculated
to attract the congregation who heard it to come where they may
expect to hear the like, and also to go where'dramas, which
exemplify "noble efforts, on the part both of their authors, actors,
and producers, are performed. Thus people might be sent from
Church to the Theatre, and from the Theatre to Church. And so
the Stage would edify the public six days a week; and the intellec-
tual and moral edifice would be crowned from the Pulpit every
Sunday. It is said that a
movement has at last
been begun for the
amelioration of ser-
mons. If so, CANON
LIGHTFOOT has evi-
dently taken a hand
in it. To call his
exceptionally sen-
sible sermon on the
Drama, as compared
with average ser-
mons, an intellectual
treat, would be to
characterise it by a
phrase which pro-
vincial reporters usu-
ally apply to a penny
reading from Pick-
wick. Yet it was
intellectual; there-
fore, a treat for a
sermon. A good
sermon, truly, is
meat for the inner
man; good meat
even as venison.
Now, in the ancient
ballad of The King
and the Miller of
Mansfield, the Mil-
ler, entertaining his
Sovereign unawares,
regales the hungry
monarch with a veni-
son pasty, which, in
respect of, its con-
tents, was derived
from his Majesty's
own deer. He dis-
tinguishes this deli-
cacy by a name in
point with respect to
the foregoing obser-
vations :—
"Here's dainty Light-
foote! In faith,
said the King,
I never before ate so
dainty a thing.",
The material veni-
son is not to be had
in season and out of
season too. The
metaphorical is al-
ways ready, and long
may it continue in
prime cut every Sun-
day, and other festi-
val or holy day of the
Church.

And parsnips for my lowly pot.
Sweet blossoms! I enjoy their sight
As much as e'er their owner can.
But is my pleasure wholly right?
Their owner is another man.
Should not the pleasure they impart,
Since they belong to him alone,

Be none of mine, and all his own?
Methinks that, as I pass along,
To look upon them I may dare,
And smell them too, and yet not wrong

With balm which sympathy supplied.

PUNCH'S PICTURE GALLERY.
SINCE the opening of the Royal Academy Exhibition, a just sur-
prise has been expressed that so few pictures are to be found on its
walls illustrating the stirring times in which we live, and that our
painters so seldom attempt to depict the remarkable events which
have happened, both at home and abroad, during the last ten or
twenty yean.
It at once occurred to SIB JOSHUA FBANCIS PUNCH, P.R.A. (Presi-
dent of the Right Sort of Academy), that the Artists only require to
have appropriate subjects suggested to them on proper authority;
and he therefore proceeded, in the few moments of leisure he could
snatch from the duties and delights of the Season, to jot down some
recent historical events of importance, which appeared to him to be
eminently suitable for pictorial treatment.
In doing this, the President soon found the contemporary history
of his own little Island so exuberant in subjects deserving a
permanent record on canvas, that he was obliged to postpone his
intention of offering some additional hints for pictures derived both
from the Old and the New Hemisphere, India, Spain, China, Japan,
France. Germany, Italy, America, Australia, Roumania, and the
Papal States.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
v
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
OB this relief much thanks, LORD
REDESIIALE. You are very watchful,
oar good Lord. Yon pointed ont to
your fellow Peers that certain Gas
Companies are trying a dodge. They
want leave to increase their prices,
permanently, because coals are dear,
temporarily. You mean to be down
upon them at the right moment.
"Steadily and diligently" is your
motto, and yon are worthy to bear it
on your shield. More power to its
Eagles. This was Monday, May 5th.
The Judicature Bill was read, by
the Lords, a Third Time, and passed,
after .a curious little debate about
letting Bishops sit on the Judicial
Committee. LORD SALISBURY did not
want their assistance. However, he
withdrew his Motion, hut strongly
objected to be called "a Quarter/'
This is right. Quarter is what the
gallant debater never gives.
In the Commons the Member for
Peterborough (a place that has a beau-
tiful Cathedral and one of the cleverest
bishops " out," and yet it elects MR.
WHALLET) brought up the ORION case
again, and demanded public assistance
for that person. MR. BRUCE snubbed him. and bade
him make hia application to the proper official, and
not bring such matters before the House. This
angered the Member for Peterborough, as shall be
seen.
MR. STANOTELD introduced a portion of the Go-
vernment scheme in regard to Local Taxation, and explained it all,
a process which occupied nearly an hour and a half. But at present.
Madam, all we need tell you is, that he proposes to rate all sorts of
Mines, Woods, Sunday Schools, Ragged Sohosls, and to exempt only
Churches and Chapels, and certain Government property. Sia
MASSEY LOPES declared that Ministers were actually riveting the
chains of those who already laboured under grievances. 'Tia a dull
subject, dear Madam. A Scot once introduced into the middle of a
book on Planting Pines, or Cleansing the Clyde, or some other serious
matter, an indecorous and utterly irrelevant story, lugged in by head
and ears, and said he did it because he had been told that his work
"required to be more lively." We doubt whether w_e could make
Local Taxation lively by a similar process (bating indecorum, of
course), but we can try.
"Our chains you shan't rivet,"
Says MASSEY, BO stout;
"All 'a right as a trivet,"
Says STANSFELD, with flout;
"Tour healths in Glenlivat,"
Says J'uticA, thumb to snout.
Do you feel oheerfuller, M'm? Then you will be prepared to
hear that certain Irishmen tried to spoil MR. FAWCETT'S Dublin
University Bill by proposing to hook on the "Catholic University"
to the former. On division, the House smashed the project by
85 to 9. Then MR. FAWCKTT'S Bill Passed.
So Brighton') FA\VCKTT, single-handed, won
This victory—which great GLADSTONE had not done.
Tuesday. —The Lords read, a Second Time, the Bill creating the Three Railway Dictators—the Traffic Triumvirate.
SIR CHARLES DILKE made a speech in favour of what he calls redressing the inequalities of the distribution of electoral power. He
complained, for instance, that there are 100 Members returned by 80,000 electors, and another 100 who represent 1,080,000. He cannot
lee the constitutional fitness of this, and talked about such a state of things being a menace to the peace of the country, at which unwisdom
the House "murmured." It may be impossible to make SIR CHARLES understand that a small but an educated constituency is likely to
choose a better Member than a great ignorant crowd, and that Parliament requires sundry balances, and not a Rule-of-Thumb system,
which would probably induce a great return of Tom Thumbs. However, MR. GLADSTONE, loudly cheered by the Conservatives, strongly
>pposed the scheme, and soon afterwards the House, impatient, brought matters to an end by cries of "Divide!" SIR CHARLES got
77 votes, and those against him were 268.
Ma. TKKVKITAN tried to convince a scanty audience, chiefly composed of soldiers, that there ought to be no more appointments
,o Honorary Colonelcies. MR. CARDWBLL opposed him, and threw out his Motion by 80 to 40. When you consider, Madam, what a
glorious being a fully-uniformed (and not necessarily fully-informed) Colonel is—the nearest approach to an earthly angel—you will
not desire that such angelic apparitions should be few and far between.
SIR JOHN LUBBOCK had a very meritorious Bill—one for preventing our Vandals from destroying Ancient Monuments—read a
Second Time, but MR. BRUCE refused to promise any public funds in carrying the measure into effect. Of course. We can make magnificent
presents to foreign arbitrators for fining us heavily in the cause of philanthropy, but we cannot afford a shilling for the preservation of
monuments of the days when England held her own against all the world. The House grew pensive, and let itself be Counted Oat.
Wednesday.—SIR WILFRID LAWSON moved the Second Reading of his famous Permissive Bill, the Bill for permitting those
irho drink water to lock up other liquors from other people. The debate was not unamusing, and morning performances of
larces are now so common that we cannot object to the Westminster Theatre following the fashion. Bat Mr. Punch is displeased

at the evidence that the Screw is put on, palpably,
by the fanatics of abstinence, and by the licensed
victuallers. The "insolence" of both sides was strongly
censured, and proof was given that English gentlemen
are indignant at dictation. MB. BRUCE opposed the Bill
heartily, and it was thrown out by 821 to 81.
Thursday.—LOBD RF.DESDALE carried Resolutions for
preventing the Gas-folks from permanently raising their
price. Some day we should like to know why they do
not, on Sunday nights, put on pressure enough to light up
our houses properly. The " dim religious light" we get
on those evenings elicits remarks which are only religious
in a criminatory sense, and "dim" becomes Mautolinian
in pronunciation.
Ha I The Constitution was in danger, for a moment.
But the SPEAKER saved it. The promoters of a Bradford
Bill introduced it in the Lords, notwithstanding that it
contained Money Clauses— conduct worthy of JONATHAN
BRADFORD. But MB. FOKSTEK instantly undertook that
submission should be made, and we breathed again.
MB. BAXTER stated that an awful amount of tobacco is
annually destroyed at the Custom House—smoked in
what is called the Queen's Pipe—but that it is all very
bad. Better far, than that it should be sold to our youth,
for the whitening of their faces, and the stunting of their
growth.
WHALLEY on ORION again. Again snubbed, he de-
manded whether MB. BRUCE would prosecute him if he
C" libhed certain letters. The HOME SECRETARY referred
to the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, and the House roared.
Yet MB. W UALLJE Y can talk good sense when he has not
got hold of a crotchet, and in a subsequent debate he
pointed out that a fine of forty shillings would not deter
the Liverpool Liberals from choking up their register
with fictitious voters, particularly Irishmen.
MB. LOWE ought not to have been asked a question
about Servants, having himself had an unpleasantness
with an insolent Teetotal Butler, whom, we are happy to
say, he defeated in open Court. And, Madam, we are
quite sure that you would applaud the true and lady-
like courage which prompted MRS. LOWE, whom the
fellow had insulted, to appear and give testimony against
him. Sham fine ladies would have declared that they
should faint away if asked to do a reasonable act like
that. Kindly ring the bell for your butler, "a spirit of
another sort, as we should like, respectfully, to drink
to MBS. LOWE'S health. To proceed. MR. HERHON (has
he any fine mountain dew, as his namesake in ancient
writ had?) asked whether, if the CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExcnmuRK gave a party, he would pay the tax on his
extra waiters. MR. LOWE was quite certain that he
would do nothing of the kind.
There was a good deal of miscellaneous talk, but we
fear that it must have been dull, for the JUNO OF THE
BELGIANS looked into the Gallery of Honour, but stayed
only ten minutes.
Friday.—LORD RUSSELL made his first appearance this
Session, but showed that he meant to make up for lost
time, moving for three sets of papers, on the subjects
whereof (Irish) he promised that their Lordships should
hear speeches. They were so delighted that they
instantly rose to go home and toll the good news to their
Peeresses and the younger ladies. Observe the exquisite
delicacy of the comparative. All ladies are young,
Madam.
"Yotmgneu ia your first law, but this confest,
Some are, and muit be, younger than the rest."
MB. EYHTN spoke out for the Police, who have many
grievances, and shall have our aid in procuring redress.
A great deal more ought to be done for the brave and
much too-goodnatured fellows who at the risk of life and
limb, keep the brutal " roughs" in some kind of order.
MR. BRUCE made the usual official reply, and praised
COLONEL HENDERSON, who deserves, we believe, all the
praise he received. But
When it's a ca«e of fair play to brave Bobby
Let every good Member select the right lobby.
MB. PETER TAYLOR'S grievance about a man who, it
was alleged, received extra sentence for laughing at
the Shiffnal Magistrates, came up again. The ATTORNEY-
GENERAL rose this time, dignus r in dice nodus, and MB.
PETEu got something which he would not have had from
the mild MB. BRUCE. SIR JOHN made great fun of
MB. TAYLOR'S grievance-mongering. and stated that the decent and tidy man
for whom he was making fight got mad drunk" four times in four years.
Should you be surprised to hear, Madam, that MR. WHALLEY got at OUT ON
again, for the third time in five days, and tried to drag Mm in on a Bankruptcy
Court vote, on the ground that OKTON had been a Bankrupt. It is true. He
tried to explode several times, but was "sat upon," the House roaring.
Finally he complained of the "insolent" manner in which he was treated, but
a cry arising, he withdrew the word. Mr. Punch's best compliments and con-
gratulations to the electors of Peterborough on their Representative Man, Are

ing as to say that]:—
"He could not con-
vince his opponents,
but he drove some of
them into a comer.
MK. DALKTMPLB, for
instance, who still pro-
poses to lock up the
drunkard, wag point-
edly asked whether
there would not be
quite as much reason
in locking up the
drink."
If Ma. DALBTM i'LK did not instantly bolt out of his corner, and over his ques-
tioner, he could have been withheld only by unilateral regard to a two-sided
proverb of the wise King's. There would not be as much reason in locking up
the drink as in locking up the drunkard. By locking up the drunkard, you
prevent him from doing harm. You do not at the same time prevent him
from exercising a power of doing good; because he is drunk and incapable.
Bat, by locking up the drink, you do not only prevent it from doing harm to
the sots who abuse it, but you also hinder it from doing good to the sober
who use it in moderation to the refreshment of their bodies, and solace and
satisfaction of their minds. In thus answering a certain description of reasoner
according to the measure of his wisdom, with a view to rectify, if not his own
estimate of it, at least that which may have been formed thereof by others, it is
humbly hoped that the mistake has not been committed of becoming like unto
him. *
The Nomenclature of Fiction.
IB a new class of titles for Novels coming into vogue? Or are the Novels
themselves going to be meteorological, like our conversation? It looks so, when
we see advertised, the one under the other, Wild Weather and Bright Morn-

Day, April Showers, Something in the Wind, Angry Clouds, All in a Fog,
A Storm Brewing, &o.
Shavings.
A MEETING of Carpenters and Joiners, in Lambeth, the other evening,
resolved to memorialise their employers for an advance of wages by one half-
penny an hour. If their demand be complied with, let us hope these British
workers in wood will know a deal better than to expend the increment of their
earnings in any description of beverage possessing the properties of American
"timberdoodle."

AFTERNOON TEA.
STUDY OF A BASHFUL MAN, WHO HAS PRIVATELY TOLD AN AMUSING STORY TO THE HOST, AND HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY Hist TO
REPEAT IT ALOUD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY. WE HAVE TRIED TO DEPICT THE WRETCHED INDIVIDUAL AT THE PRECISE
MOMENT WHEN, HAVING MANAGED TO SlAMMEE THROUGH TWO-THIRDS OF HIS ANECDOTE (WHICH IS EATHER LONG), HE BECOMES
CONSCIOUS, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THAT HE HAS COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN THE POINT.
THE SCOTTISH GRAZE.
THE typical Scotchman, if a reader of the Record, must have
perused with mingled feelings of pride and horror the subjoined
paragraph:—
"THE REFORM CLUB AND SUNDAYS.—At the Annual Meeting of the
members of the Reform Club, held on Thursday last, LOUD EIU.-KY presiding
—a strong protest was made by KIR JOHN MURRAY, of Philiphaugh, against
the use of the billiard and card rooms on Sundays. He moved a resolution
that an order should be given to close the rooms on those days. The resolu-
tion was supported, and, after considerable discusiion, an overwhelming
majority of the members decided upon keeping the rooms open."
SAWNEY cannot hut feel proud of SIR JOHN MURRAY, of Philip-
haugh, for the valiant testimony borne by that undaunted Scot in
the attempt, wherein even failure was glorious, to vindicate in the
face of the Reform Club the observance of the Scottish Sawbbath.
But neither can SAWNEY not be horrified by the determination of the
Reform Club to suffer cards and billiards within their walls of a
Sunday. For SAWNKY is the subject of a fixed idea that, apart from
gambling, vicious on any day of the week, it is sinful to play cards
or billiards on the first, which he confounds with the seventh, to be
observed as it was appointed to be by the Jews, with certain Pres-
byterian additions of his own, and thus kept as a Seoto-Judaic
holiday.
And SAWNEY does not ask himself whether he would not invade
religious liberty if he shut the card and billiard rooms of a Club,
comprising: Jewish members, in the faces of those gentlemen on his
own Sawbbath and not theirs.
Perhaps SAWNEY is afraid that things will ultimately go so far as
to be managed here as they are in France; so that, one of these fine
mornings, he will be shocked by an announcement corresponding,
for London, to the statement, in Monday's I'M Matt Gazette,
respecting Paris, that :—
"M. TRIERS attended the races in the Bois de Boulogne yesterday. He
had previously received the KINO OF NAPLES."
To receive the KINO OF NAPLES on a Sunday was probably bad
enough, in the estimation of SAWNEY; but afterwards to go to the
races, and that for the ruler of a nation, was it not absolutely
awt'u'? SAWNEY may well shudder as he imagines himself reading
of a similar impiety announced as having been committed by a suc-
cessor of MB. GLADSTONE.
SKIRTS IN THE STREET.
A CON-CESSION, which the organ of millinery appears to consider
great, has been made by Fashion to Common Sense and Cleanliness.
According to Le Fottet " the out-door morning dresses "for May
"are made just to touch, or even to clear the ground." How ultra-
reasonable and how exceedingly pure must be the skirts of the latter
description, those which are so moderately long that they do not so
much as quite touch the ground, but even actually clear it I Of
some of these morning dresses the length has been retrenched to the
immaculate extremity of clearing the ground to the extent of almost
an inch! For, as to one of them:—
"It was of dust-coloured poil de cherre, with narrow hair-stripea of a
darker shade. The skirt was about an inch from the ground, and had five
orossway flounces bound with green at the lower edge, and occupying about
half the skirt; at the top of these there was a green ruche in inch and a half
wide."
For orossway flounces, especially, those flounces are of oourse_the
best adapted of which the lowermost one does not sweep the crossing.
In that case the " dust-coloured poil de ch£vre" flounce admits of
relief in being "bound with green at the lower edge." But other-
wise it would very soon get that gayer tint obscured and assimilated
to its own, whilst it acted as a besom.

CHAPTER I.— A Conference 'between an Angler, a Hunter, and a
Hawker — What came of it.
THE FIEST DAT.
PISCATOB. VEWATOB. AUCEPS.

Piscator. Ton are
well overtaken, Gen-
tlemen.! A good
morning to you
both! I hope your
business may occa-
sion you towards
Ware, whither I am
going; this fine May
morning.
Auceps. My ware
is the occasion of my
business. I am a
Hawker. You may
know that from my
pack.
Venator. And I,
Sir, am a simple
Hunter, though you
c mid not oome at
that knowledge, see-
i'-'g me without my
pack.
Piieator. I am
right glad to hear
your answers. lam,
.Si r, a Brother of the
Angle.
Auceps. Marry, I had a Sister in a Circle. She IB now a Colum-
bine.
Piscator. Nay, you mistake my meaning. I am an honest fisher-
man. and I purpose taking my morning oup at the "Welsh Harp."
Venator. Sir, I shall by your favour bear yon company, for, in
sooth, I do begin to mistrust the coming of a fox in my way, this
May morning; and, indeed, my horse and I having parted at the
last privet hedge, he preferring to remain on one side while I came
over on to the other, I doubt whether I shall oome up with the
hounds, which, if I am rightly informed, are appointed to meet
some miles hence.
Piscator. Here is the " Bald-faced Stag." Let us turn into it,
and refresh ourselves with a cup of drink, and a rest.
Auceps. Most gladly, Sir. This is very excellent ale.
Piscator. I exchange courtesies with you both. A small glass of
Geneva thrown into it, thus, leavens the whole, like a spice of Cal-
vinism in the Thirty-nine Articles.
Aucepi. Ay, and assists to settle it: like an arbitration.
Venator. Sirs, your discourse charms me to an attention.
Piscator. Why then, Sir, I will take a little liberty to propose to
you that one should be at charges for the other.
Venator. Nay, Sir -
Piscator. I accept your courtesy. Hostess, take my young friend
MASTER VENATOB'S proffered coin.
Auceps, Prithee stay your hand an instant. I will try chances
with you, good Sir, to discover which of ns two shall discharge lie
score of the three.
Venator. Nay, Sir, I cry you mercy -
Auceps. Marry, yon should have cried " Heads," for 'tis " Tails,"
and you have lost.
Piscator. I am glad we are on the road once more. We shall
goon oome to where the river will stop our morning's walk.
Venator. 0 me! I have lost my cigar-case.
Auceps. Nay, Sir, never look so downcast at this ill-stroke. I
have in my pack two bundles of cigars from the Havannahs, all
excellent good, which I am minded to let you have a rare bargain.
See how brown and glossy is their appearance; tied about, too. with
a yellow fillet. Marry there be those of high degree who should not
deal with me at one shilling a-pieoe. But, since your presence and
fair conversation like me, yon shall have them for sixpence each,
and I protest this is, as it were, to bestow them with an open hand.
Do you smoke, Ma. PISCATOR P
Piscator. I do, Sir, in good truth. Indeed I have a sufficiency of
the herb, in my pouch, for my own wants. Were I not thus fur-
nished, I would — while our very young friend VRNATOB is counting
his money, apart and out of hearing — I would, I say, take a liberty
to inquire three things of you. Firstly, Of what colour is the
grass r Secondly, Do you notice a reflection of that colour iu either
of my eyes? And, thirdly, Are you, as a sportsman, sufficiently
skilled in the art of approaching a weasel with so great caution that
he shall not be disturbed by your footsteps, and therewith proceed-
ing so skilfully to shave off his eyebrows, that the creature snail not
discover your trick until he be awoke?
Auceps. Marry, Sir, I think I do perceive your meaning. Silence
is silvern?
Piscator. Ay, now, Sir, you talk like an artist. Nay, I am not
to be put off with less than seven, and those, mark you, good.
Auceps. Give me your hand. There, Sir.
Venator. Honest AUCKPS, here are two pounds ten for one bundle.
Auceps. It is a match, Sir. Marry, here is one that strikes only
on its own box. And now, Gentlemen, I must part with you at this
park-wall, for which I am very sorry. But, I assure you. MR.
PISCATOR, that, however fishy I may have hitherto considered your
general conduct, vet I now part with you full of good thoughts, not
only of yourself, but your recreation. Heaven keep you both.
Piscator. Well, now honest AT/CKPS is gone, MR. VENATOR, I will
tell you all I know about angling.
Venatur. Sir, my patience and diligence shall not be wanting.
But I would first ask you if you can teach me how to jerk a coin in
the air so it fall this or that side uppermost, as you shall list.
Piscator. 0, Sir, doubt not, 'tis an art, whereof honest AUCEPS is
a master. Favour me with half-a-orown, and I will show you how
the feat may be suitably accomplished. Nay, this is an indifferent
piece.
Vtinator. Marry, Sir, it was one given me in change by honest
AUCEPS. But here is another.
Piscator. You shall put my skill to the trial when we have
breakfasted.
Venator. I would I had breakfasted ere I had attempted that cup
of ale and these cigars.
Piscator. Nay, Sir, you look pale. Here is the " Welsh Harp."
Hostess, how do you P I will myself see this poor young gentleman
safely bestowed in bed. Now, Hostess, a cup of your best, and
breakfast at once.
Hostess. I will do it, Ma. PISCATOR, and with all the speed I can.
AN EXTRAORDINARY CHAIR.
THERE has been a conference at the Hall of the Clothworkers'
Company, to consider the best means of promoting technical educa-
tion in connection with the cloth trade. One of the speakers at the
meeting was in favour of the establishment of "an itinerant chair,
with an eminent man at its head, to teach physios and chemistry in
the most important clothing districts in the country."
This proposition is as hard as any in Euclid. It presents three
almost insurmountable obstacles. First of all, the notion of an
itinerant chair—a chair on its legs journeying from place to place,
is not easy to take in. But we will suppose this difficulty overcome,
by the kind assistance of the Railway Companies, and that the chair
is fairly started on its travels—the position of the eminent man at
its head, not, be it observed, as is ordinarily the case, seated on its
bottom, does strike us as uncomfortable, dangerous, and for any
length of time well-nigh impossible. No salary, however liberal,
could compensate the most eminent man for being placed in such a
situation. Then, lastly, highly intelligent as modern chairs and
tables appear to be, not even the most confirmed spiritualist has at
present succeeded in finding a piece of furniture competent "to
teach physics and chemistry.
Unluckily, we have not had the advantage of a technical educa-
tion, or this magic chair, which it was suggested might go about the
country, with an eminent man at its head, teaching natural philoso-
phy in the clothing districts, would probably appear as simple a
thing as logarithms or local taxation.
Proverb and Prescription.
THAT " what's enough for one's enough for two,"
The saying is but in a measure true;
That is, a physiologist might say.
For each, of his or her three meals a day.
Science Gossip.
BOTANISTS have observed that the language of flowers is not a
faculty developed alike in all blossoms. Some possess it more than
others. For instance, flowers of speech have it to a remarkable
extent.
THE NEEDFUL LAW REFORM.
THERE is one glaring deficiency in the LORD CHANCELLOR'S Judi-
cature Bill. No clause provides for the creation of a Lord Cheap
Justice.

PHIZES for improved Cabs have been generously
offered, and specimens of new vehicles are now being
exhibited, which we may hope, if we live long enough,
to see some day in public use. When we have improved
our Cabs, perhaps we may begin to hope for gome im-

there is actually room. Who drives clean Hansoms
should himself be clean, not in person merely, but ill
raiment and in speech. So, projecting our prophetic
mental eye into the future, we can see the British
Cabman courteous, civil, cleanly, cheerful, and _content-
edly receiving his proper legal fare. A Cab will be no
longer a mere vehicle of abuse, and its driver will no
more offend against the laws of grammar, or show his
lack of chivalry when a fair lady is his fare. Instead
of slamming the door savagely, and blurting out,
"Vere to?'T he will perform the shutting softly, and
say gently, "May I beg, Sir, to know the destination to
which I hope to have the honour of conducting you P"
Moreover, far from growling out "Yot'sthisr" when
tendered his right fare, he will bow politely, and accept
it with a smile and a civil phrase of thanks. Indeed,
there is no telling at what an altitude of refinement our
Cabmen may arrive, when their carriages have been
improved. They may actually abstain from smoking in
their Cabs while waiting for a hire, and their manners
may become so altered for the better that the title of the
Growlers will be exchanged for that of Smilers, while the
Hansoms may by synonym be hailed as the Polites.
QUESTION AND ANSWER.
SIXTY-TWO thousand Members of the Church of
England, and more, have memorialised the Archbuheps
with a complaint that Roman doctrine is systematically
preached in Anglican pulpits. "If it were so it were a
grievous fault," the pleaders for Pseudo-Popery admit:
* but then," they say, " we must settle what is Roman."
That may seem no easy thing for anybody to do, and
clearly, if the POPE, and no one else, is infallible,
Romanism can be defined with certainty by the Roman
Pontiff himself alone; but, if the word of his head-man
in this nation is to be taken for what is Roman, then,
as to the fact that Roman doctrines are preached within
the Established Church, it is only certain _ that DR.
MANNING has said so, and exulted in it; that is all.

DOMESTIC EXPECTATIONS.
CLEARLY, Servants now-a-days are not to be contented with mere
payment of their wages. To judge by this advertisement, they have
moro than mere pecuniary expectations, when they condescend to
apply for a new place:—
"A thorough Housemaid, where men-servants are kept. Christian priri-
leges expected."
What are the Christian privileges which this young lady expects?
Church- or chapel-going doubtless may be reckoned in their number,
and possibly flirtation may likewise be included, or why should she
have stipulated that men-servants should be kept P Another Chris-
tian privilege may be the wearing of the dresses of her mistress on
a Sunday: at least this is a privilege which some maid-servants
in Christendom are pretty sure to exercise, if they can get the
chance.

PROFESSIONAL CAUTION.
Mr. Blueoag (out for a Day's Shooting with his Articled ClerK\. "STOP A MINUTE—DON'T FIRE I—LET 's SBB IF THAT BIRD 's IN THE

CRITICISM.
MB. PUNCH seldom quotes, except when he is in a fit of admira-
tion. He is now in a perfect convulsion, caused by that sentiment.
Head this, from the Morning Advertiser ('tis part of a lovely notice
of the Royal Academy), and rejoice that artists have such critics to
appreciate them:—
"M u. V u FBINCEF contributes two examples, one of whioh represents a
scene in the country of the Gadarenes, illustrative of a herd of swine rushing
ii'iwn some precipitous and jagged cliffs into the sea. It ia bold, and essen-
tially novel in treatment. It is culled "The Gadarene Swine" (938). Two
Indies ascending the staircase ia "Devonshire House" (896) is a totally
different subject, showing that ME. P&INCBF is not limited either in resources
or power."
"MB. VAL " is slightly familiar, the Catalogue merely giving the
gentleman's initial; but the Critic would probably have us infer
an intimacy between himself and MR. P. The existence of this is
•lu: more probable, inasmuch as the Painter's name is spelt wrongly,
twice. Of the " scene" depicted it is evident that the Critic never
heard at all. But we entirely agree with his last proposition;
namely, that a painting of two gracious young ladies going up-stairs
to a dance is totally different" from a painting of several little
black pig^s going down a cliff into the Sea. On the whole, however,
such criticism ia hardly fair to the patrons of the Morning Adver-
tiser, whose parlours are usually adorned with works of Art whioh
i-how that their owners are imbued with true aesthetic principles.
Romantic Nonsense.
IT is pretty well understood that there is a large and influential
section of the Community—unmarried ladies looking out for a
settlement, an establishment, a position—who do not agree with the
author of a modern poem, that Love is Enough. Many other things,
they say, are wanted besides—such as a town and a country house,
a carriage or two, saddle horses, some creditable jewellery, perhaps
a box at the Opera, and, above all, plenty of pin-money.
FOOLS AND FIREWORKS.
IT is now gome time since there has been an illumination, such as
was heretofore customary on certain festivals, of St. Peter's at Rome.
Can that discontinuance of a popular exhibition of fireworks account
for the circumstance thus stated by a contemporary's Roman corre-
spondent?
"The silly and dastardly habit of throwing exploding missile* in the neigh-
bourhood of places of worship, and sometimes in the very midst of the con-
gregation, continues to be occasionally practised at Rome. An instance took
place on Sunday last at the Church of Santa M .iriii in Trastevere, which was
very much crowded, when a petard, only consisting of gunpowder tightly
bound with paper, but sufficiently noisy to produce a great deal of alarm, was
discharged in the external portion of the church."
Surely the Roman populace have not turned Protestant! When
they fling crackers into Catholic churches it can only be to hint to
the ecclesiastical authorities their dissatisfaction at missing their
accustomed pyrotechnic displays. They doubtless as little intend
any demonstration of their religious feelings as our own Cads do on
the Fifth of November, when they use to fling about explosive pro-
jectiles in memory of the Gunpowder Plot. The Roman Rough is
probably ignorant of the claims to canonisation whioh might be
advanced on behalf of GUI- FAWKEB, incendiary and martyr.
Law, Ancient and Modern.
"In a case in the Common Fleas on Friday, in which a well-known lady
applied for, and obtained, a rule for a new trial, a previous verdict being
against evidence, Ma. SBBJEANT BALLANTIXB handed up to the Bench the
garment* for the price of which she had been sued. 'Uod bless me!' said
the LORD CHIBP JUSTICB, astounded at the charge*." • • -,'*

A BRITON ON THE BALLOT.
MY Rulers I have cause to bless,
Albeit none at all too BOOH;
Bat 0, the Ballot, I confess,
To me has proved a precious boon.
I was but in a measure taught
To think what it would do for me,
And, till I got it, never thought
How great a blessing it would be.
To vote as conscience might require
That 'twould enable me, I knew;
As well unmindful of the 'Squire,
As reckless of the Parson too.
But now, besides, I also find
It stands between me and the strong,
In Union, League, or Club combined,
Unto whose party I belong.
I 'm free to vote as any bird;
An ox no longer in a drove,
No sheep nor pig in flock or herd:
Now I 'm an independent cove.
And other fellows, if they please,
Both can, and will too, vote alone;
And not in swarms, the same as bees,
Instead of queen that serve a drone.
They '11 vote for steady men and sure,
Who '11 rights preserve and wrongs amend,
And British property secure,
And British liberties defend.
I question if the great and good,
Who gave the Ballot, fully knew
What they were at, or understood
Quite all the wonders it would do.
Legal Intelligence.
TIIK Court of Queen's Bench, Westminster, at Niti
Print, the other day, was occupied during nearly the
whole of it with the trial of a running-down case. This
is a lawsuit, dears, altogether different from an action
for slander or libel.
COOKERY AND CRIBBERY.
WORTHY Mr. Punch, although by nature the reverse of niggardly
or skimping, I am perforce a practical economist; for, having a
email income and rather a large family. I find it needful to econo-
mise that I may make ends meet. Indeed, with mutton chops at
fifteen pence a pound, it is no easy matter now to make ends (purse
ends) meat; and one might certainly be tempted to become a vege-
tarian, if asparagus were only not so ruinous in price.
Now, I observe that at South Kensington daily lessons in plain
cookery are given for benefit of people like myself, who have to
make the best of what is not too bad to eat With the best of
things, indeed, one may get but a bad dinner, if one has the mis-
fortune to be served bv a Dad cook. So I welcome with delight any
effort that is made to further the advancement of the culinary art,
which certainly in England falls short .of such perfection as leaves
nothing to be wished.
That man, I imagine, is deserving of a statue who simply teaches
ladies what to do with their cold mutton, in order to secure its re-
appearance on the table in a palatable shape: and he who further
can invent some ingenious deviation from the ordinary course, or
courses, of our dinners, I consider as a noble benefactor to his
species, whose achievements should be blazoned on the deathless
scroll of fame.
But there is one point which, I fancy, as yet has escaped notice
in this useful School of Cookery, and one on which, were I the
Lecturer, I should plainly say some words. Tbe point is that of
Perquisites—which, for sake of proper emphasis, please to print with
a big P. Perquisites, I fancy, are one of the chief causes that
ruin English Cookery, and make our Cooks dishonest and their
dishes vapid, tasteless, and unworthy of their cost. For instance,
over-fattened meat is purchased for the sake of conversion into
dripping, an end which roaring fires are facile to promote. The best
part of the gravy is thus dried out of the beef, and its place supplied
out badly with hot water from the tap. In short, while Cooks are
TOL. MTV.
dazzled by the golden vision of their perquisites, they cannot keep a
proper eye upon their spits and stewpans, and the Black Doll of the
bone-shop is the idol whereto sacrifice of made dishes is made.
A Course of Lectures upon Cookery can, I think, be hardly perfect
without mention of this idol, and the evils which its worship must
inevitably work. Down with the Black Doll! then, -i has la Pou-
pi'<; Noire! cry I to all our English, or French-English Cooks.
"No Perquisites Allowed " be the postscript to advertisements. Let
no more dirty circulars be dropped into our areas, giving last quota-
tions of the market rate of Kitchen-stuff, or mentioning the prices
current for old Bones. Stop pilfering, in short, which is another
name for perquisites, and depend on it the cost of our dinners will
diminish, and their excellence increase.
Humbly hopeful that, at any rate, poor people like myself may
find that it is possible to act upon this hint, believe me,
Yours respectfully,
Queer Street, Eve of Rent Day. E r AM iXONDAS JOKES.
PS.—" All Fours" has been considered a favourite kitchen game;
but one even still more popular, I fancy, has been " Cribbage.
Competent Juries.
Son E discussion has taken place in the House of Commons re-
specting the pecuniary qualifications of Jurymen. The only such
qualification that can make a man really fit to serve on a Jury is
pecuniary independence. If he have to live by any business, from
which he is dragged away to sit in a jury-box, there he may sit;
but he will be utterly unable to attend to anything that is going on.
His mind will be distracted by anticipations of loss and ruin. Your
Lordship may compel him to swear that he will well and truly try,
&c.; but then you will oblige the man to take an oath that he will
do what it is impossible he can, and will force him to commit that
misdemeanor for which the trial of CASTBO, alias OKTON, is
pending.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
AKTI.K'S (we mean SIB BARTLK FREEE'S) Mission
to Zanzibar, to pat an end to the slave-trading
in that region, was stated (Monday, Stay 12) to
have failed. The SULTAN had two excellent reasons
for being obdurate: he makes much money by
the traffic—that is one; bat we are sore that the
other had the greater weight with hie pious soul.
His Cardinals, or Confessors, or whatever name his
spiritual directors bear, assure him that slavery is
ordained by the Koran, and, therefore, that it would
be wicked to suppress the system. We may regret
that he does not think as we do, but it is impossible
not to respect the feelings of a religious sovereign,
who listens to the counsel of holy men. LORD (J u v x-
VILLE stated, however, that SIR BARTLE FRERE had
obtained valuable information, and had made two
new treaties with influential chiefs. We are quite
certain that SIR BARTLB did all that man could do-
cannon might have done a little more, but England
neither speaks cannons nor uses them, now.
On complaint in the Commons that a paper called
The Christian was refused registration for the foreign
post, the Post Master explained that it did not
mainly consist of news. Cynics might say that such
a name, if its meaning were carried out in the
columns of the paper, might well entitle it to be
considered an entire novelty.
MK. WAIT, the new Conservative Member for
Gloucester, took the oaths.
"They aleo serve who only stand and wait."
But this gentleman only stood and—was elected.
Correspondents will please to be merciful with their
pleasantries on a "waiting policy being that of
Toryism," and the like effulgences.
MR. Dm.wrx tried to abolish the salary of the
Lord Privy Seal. Now it has been explained, over
and over, that this is a most useful official, that he is
the Odd Man of the Cabinet, and has to do all kinds
of work, in order to relieve his various colleagues.
The Motion was a bit of radical pedantry, and Ma.
GLADSTONE stamped it out, getting 229 to 59.
Pleasanter words from MR. WALPOLK, who. as a
Trustee of the Museum, asked for about £100.000, and
told us that we had the finest collection of Roman
coins in the world, and had lately purchased one of the most beautiful collections of works of Art ever brought into this country. We
had gained, inter alia, a glorious Juno, and a divine Venus. The Museum beasts and birds would speedily be exported to Kensington.
It will take some time to get rid of the abominable smell of camphor, though.
"Out with the fusty creatures, and their camphor, a
Nuisance, and in with urn, and bust, and amphora."
Among the questions raised in Supply was one which is what SHAKSPEARE calls " a question to be asked." To a gentleman named
THURLOW a pension was granted about forty years ago, and he has now received about £193,000. There cannot be, of course, the faintest
doubt that he has deserved every half-farthing of it, but none of the Ministers could give the slightest information as to the history of the
grant. Probably the recipient is the THURLOW who was Secretary of State to OLIVER CROMWELL, but we might be told, we think.
A vote for £6165 was taken for the Deep Sea Exploration. It would be a pleasant and also a profitable thing if our gallant Dredgers
would bring up some of those
"Wedges of gold * * * heaps of pearl,
Inestimable atones, unvalued jewels,
All scattered in the bottom of the sea,"
which were seen one night by a late DUKE OF CLARENCE.
MR. STANSFBLD obtained his Select Committee on Boundaries. This is part of the Local Taxation scheme. He wants to get rid of old
parochial and other arrangements, and, in fact, will
"Let vulgar Bounds with brave disorder go,
And snatch a Bate beyond the reach of LOWE."
Tuesday.—LORD CAIRNS, Conservative leader, moved the Second Reading of Ma. FAWCETT'S Dublin University Bill. He did not
approve of the policy of which it was part, but as Tests had been abolished in England the same thing must be done for Ireland.
LORD DENBIGH, as a Catholic, could not accept the Bill as an instalment of justice, but as he could not support tests which he deemed
blasphemous, he should not vote. Now the Tests may be unjust, but to call them what he called them was to talk nonsense. Mr. Punch
is reminded of something that appeared in a Conservative paper twenty years ago—it would admit no such blunder now—where it was
said that "a mob then advanced, bearing banners lettered ' God made us all,' with other blasphemous inscriptions."
EARL GREY painted Irish prospects in black, and EARL GHANVILLE hung up a companion picture in rose colour, and the Bill was read
a Second Time. It passed at the end of the week. We compliment Brighton on its Member, also on its Aquarium.
Something is being done, for preservation, to MR. MACLISB'S great'works in the Royal Gallery, but MR. ABBL cannot report upon the
result until he shall have waited to know it. ABEL is from a Hebrew word signifying "transitoriness." We decline to accept the omen
as regards the pictures.
In the Commons we had a capital evening. Madam, bear with a brief explanation. ANNE LADY DACRE, by will, dated Decem-
ber 20th, 1594, left funds which it is perfectly clear that the good woman meant for the benefit of the poor of Westminster. Never
mind details. The Corporation of London got hold of it, lawfully enough, but did not act with faithfulness, and now, out of sixty
children in the school LADY DACRE founded, Westminster has only thirty-two. The establishment is called Emanuel Hospital. LADY
DACRE is buried, under a stately monument, in Chelsea Old Church. The Endowed School Commissioners propose to take the institution
out of the hands of Gog and Magog, and to carry out the intention of good ANNE. But it is not in G. and M.'s nature willingly to give
np anything they have grabbed. To-night MR. CHAWFORD (the excellent M.P. for London) moved for the rejection of the scheme of

the Commissioners, He could not aay much for his clients, but he
managed unconsciously to represent their grievance as it appears
most frightful to themselves. The idea of interfering with the
an trust Corporation of London!
Now, MB. GLADSTONE has plenty of Veneration, hut he does not
bestow it at random. To-night he bestowed something else. In
•noble and Homeric wrath he stood up to the two-headed monster of
Guildhall, and
Nay, look at the Cartoon.
"What! the City of London, fatted, gorged, not to say Bloated
with charities—the City of London struggling to hold what was
meant for poor, helpless Westminster! And the City alone, of all
the Institutions in England, is not to have a hand laid upon it!
Take that, and that, you "But where's HOMES f

Full on that cheek of his unwary foe.
Beneath the ponderous arm's resistless sway

Like a large fob, when winds and waters roar,
By some huge billow dashed against the shore."
The death-blow was given, bat there was prolonged debate—
"For the prey was strong, and he strove for life."
But the Division came, and Gog and Magog were declared extinct
by 286 to 233. They died hard—likewise impenitent. Be it said
that MB. GLADSTONE never made a better fighting-speech in all his
life.
Wednesday.—Yesterday, Madam, your PBEMIEB appeared as the
champion of property, and as the upholder of the saoredness of
bequests. To-day he showed as a bulwark of the Church of Eng-
land.
MB. COWPEB-TEMPLE promoted a Bill for opening the Church
pulpits to other persons than Clergymen. He thought that there was
a great deal of preaching power outside the Establishment, and that
it was a pity that a parson who was not himself a Boanerges, or a
Bossuet, or a Wilberforoe, should not be able to call in a talented
friend to edify a flock.
After some discussion. MB. GLADSTONE said that the House last
year had rejected the Bill, not as a Party question, bat by the free
expression of all shades of opinion, and it was not equitable to in-
troduce it, year after year, in obedience to the dictates of a Church
Kef orm Society. How could we allow persons under no subscription
or declaration to get up in our churches and preach just what they
pleased P The unrestrained liberty of the priest teas the slavery of the
congregation. (Note that, young Ritualist.) He would oppose a
measure that would be the harbinger of religious chaos.
MR. ImNGWORTH, a Dissenter, made a funny little objection to
the Bill. If the idea was that Dissenters were to be smuggled in to
preach in the afternoon, when the best people stayed at home, and
the congregation was composed of maid-servants, he was quite sure
that the Nonconformists wanted no such favour. But he should
like a Disestablishment Bill.
MB. (."OUTER-TEH pi.E did not care about dividing, but there was
some dispute, so the Bill was oast out by 199 to 53.
MB. CHARLEY'S Bill, to prevent Infanticide, was read a Second
Time, but will not be pressed. The subject is a difficult one. A
jury will seldom convict an unhappy creature whose misery may
have driven all her feminine instincts out of her, and thus child-
murder is not dealt with at all.
MB. PLIMSOLL'S own Bill, for the survey of Shipping, was talked
out of the House—that is, MB. EUSTACE SMITH, who answered him,
was speaking when the time came to rise, and the Bill dropped.
Thursday. — The Commons gave the night to Ireland. The
O'KKEFFE case came up. In brief, Madam, that case is this. CAK-
DINAL ('CLI.I-N (who was, by the way, sent to Ireland by Home,
when somebody else would have been much more welcome to the
Irish Catholics of the higher sort) took upon himself to suspend one
FATHEB O'KEEFFE, and this the Cardinal did as Legato of the POPE,
not as the Father's ecclesiastical Superior. It was done, because
MB. O'KKKFFE dared to exercise his rights as a British subject, and
appeal to the law against what he declared to be priestly slander.
Then the Irish Education Board dismiss the Father from his school
at Callan, on the ground that he had been suspended. Of course all
this looks very like abject obedience to CARDINAL CUI.LEX, and MB.
BOCTKRIB was about to take the sense of the Imperial Parliament
on the matter. But on the Board are several men of high rank and
real eminence, and they object to be judged by the House until they
can be heard. So LOUD HARTINQTON, Minister, asked for a Select
Committee. MB. BOUVEBIE complained that he had been " roped,"
but it is a pity to use horse-racers' slang, especially when you don't
understand its dirty meaning. "Roping " means a mode of cheat-
ing frequently practised on that great English institution, the race-
course, bat it is pulling a horse to prevent his winning, not shoving
him to the rope, as M u. BOUVERIE thought. He let out pretty freely
on the matter, and irreverently described the Commissioners as the
mere creatures and serfs of CARDINAL CULLEN, language which
should not have been applied to several of them. After some
wrangle, LOBD HABTINGTON carried his Motion, but by only 159 to
131. Now 28 is not the sort of majority for a Government, when it
puts out its strength.
Then a Peace Preservation (Ireland) Bill was read a Second Time.
Some Irish Members opposed it, but THE O'DoNOGHUE came out with
the manly and frank declaration that he believed that the Bill was
wanted, that it was no grievance, and would not have been talked
of as one, but for a knot of Dublin newspaper scribblers. MK.
MUNSTER was utterly unable to describe the munstrous indignation
he felt at such a speech, but the House did not seem to regret his
inability, and laughed at him.
Friday.—The Traffic Triumviri were finally confirmed in their
authority by the House of Lords.
This was a GLADSTONE week. A third time. Madam, did our
fighting I'IIK.Mimt address himself to battle. On Wednesday he was
the bulwark of the Church, to-day he was her Champion.
MB. MIALL, in a temperate speech, brought on his Resolution
against maintaining the Establishment.
M it, GLADSTONE declared that the feeling of the nation was against
subversion of the Church, as would be shown at a general election.
The question was indefinitely remote. "Take the Church of
England out of the History of England, and that history becomes a
chaos without order or life." The Church had played a great part,
"so vital, entering so profoundly into the life and action of the
country, that the very attempt in mind to sever the two leaves
nothing bat a bleeding and lacerated mass." And hear the PBE-
MIKII'S concluding words, spoken after he had described MB. MIALL
as the Peter-the-Hermit of an objectionable crusade :—
"I invite the House distinctly and decisively to refuse its assent to this
Motion, because it is a Motion the conclusions of which are alike at variance
with the practical wishes and desires, with the intelligent opinions, and with
the religious convictions of the large majority of the people of this country."
Tremendous Conservative as well as Liberal cheers greeted this
peroration. MB. V. HABCOUBT began to be constitutional on the
same side,
But, " Divide, Divide, Divide!"
The House of Commons cried,
and for MB. MIALL'S Motion there were 61, while MB. GLADSTONE'S
"invitation" was accepted by 356, majority for sustaining the

The Peace Preservation (Ireland) Bill went through Committee,
certain Irish Members hindering it by divisions in which their small
numbers justified' MB. HAMBBO'S taunt that they had no case
against the Government. It was not a pleasant thing, however, to
see even a small body of politicians struggling desperately against a
measure for the protection of life and property, and Mr. Punch
went, sadly, to his Club, where he indignantly rebuked the usually
intelligent waiter, for asking him whether he would take Irish
whiskey.
ANALOGIES OF LANGUAGE.
LOBD LINDSAY has written a learned work, in which he tries to
make out ancient Etrusoau akin to modern High Dutch. From this
attempt, says the Saturday Bevieio :—
"He is not even deterred by the mysterious phrases K&T{ fy"rafi by which
the worshippers were dismissed at the Eleusinian mysteries, and which some
have identified with the not more intelligible form Cantha Pachsa, with which
the Brahmins close their religious services. For LORD CRAWFORD these
words have no mystery at all, and represent simply Bang zu ambachs, or
zumbacht,—' (io to your practical duties,' 'Go about your business.'"
LOBD CBAWFOBD'S authority is weighty, and the valedictory
words of the Elensinian hierophant may have nearly corresponded
to the lif, missa eat of another. It may, however, be worthy of
consideration whether those sonorous expressions were not intended
by the reverend mystery-men at once to impose upon the vulgar
and conciliate the wise, by the latter of whom «.'>yi. was understood
to mean "noses," with the suggestion of "taking a sight;" whereas
o>iro{ was the original word whence, with the addition of an aspirate,
we have derived "humbug."

A TELEGRAM from Vienna, the other day, said : —
"M. SI.AVT, the President of the Hungarian Ministry, has arrived here."
The EMPRROR OF AUSTRIA, being also KINO OF HUNGARY, the
Minister, M. SLAW, may be described as one of His Majesty's
servants; and a fool would perhaps add the remark that, as that
Sovereign has become a Constitutional monarch, it seems odd that
his Premier should be a SLAVY.

PARA.LOGY OF THE PUMP.
GOOD Templars, Beloved Brethren, a word in your ears—if they
are not too long. It ia not generally supposed that the RKV.
DAWSON BUBNS is professionally connected with the provincial
Press. But, Dear Friends, a letter in a country paper from its
London Correspondent, likely to be rather widely read, contains a
specimen of reasoning exactly like that of which examples commonly
appear in communications to which our reverend and Permissive
Prohibitory brother has signed his name. It relates to what the
writer calls "MB. BERNAL OSBOBNE'S astounding statement that
Protestants have just as much right to forbid Catholics to eat fish
during Lent, as two-thirds of the rate-payers have to prevent the
sale of intoxicating drinks." Astounding MB. B. O.'s statement
may be to us, Brethren; it is not, however, original, being merely
the converse of what has previously been often urged elsewhere,
with the differences only of meat for fish and Catholic for Protestant
majority;. These differences dp not at all affect the aptitude of the
illustration, which some logician, who, if not MB. DAWSON BUKNS
himself, argues just like him, thus impugns :—
"It ii by no mean) necenary to be a supporter of the Permissive Bill in
order to see the fallacy of this argument. Indeed, the opponents of the Bill
themselves denounced MR. OBBORNK'S speech in the lobby after the division.
No one can lay that eating fish either injures the eater or throws upon the
rate-papers the harden of supporting his children whom his indulgence has
pauperised. When rate-payer* find that unlimited drink-Belling imposes a
heavy penalty upon them, they hare a right to protest, and something more."
Yea, Dear Friends, they have, certainly, a right to protest and
something more, but 0, that something must be something else than
the invasion of personal liberty. We should abstain from injustice
as well as intoxicating liquors. Every one has, we must sadly
admit, just as much right to drink beer, or anything else not
poisonous, as he has to eat fish or meat either. It is too true that,
because rate-payers are aggrieved through A's drunkenness, they
have no right, therefore, to debar B from hie drink. No more right,
unhappily, have they to prohibit C from selling drink to B, who
keeps sober, merely because if A can buy it he gets drunk. A is
the nuisance which only they have a right to abate, Brethren.
They have no case against either B or C. If they had, then indeed
they would be warranted in shutting up, not only public-houses,
but likewise wine-merchants' and grocers' shops, and, more than that,
would enjoy the glorious privilege of interfering with the privacy
in which, according to another BURNS (alas!) than our own DAWSON—
"Willie brew'd a peck o' nurat"
They might just as well ask to be empowered to stop domestic
brewing as to abolish inns and taverns. In short, you Pumps, the
principle underlying the paralogism above quoted is that a majority
of ratepayers ought to be empowered to forbid the sale of any article
or commodity whatsoever, from the abuse of which they are liable
to incur expense or damage. If that rule were generally enforced,
in a short time how many shops of any kind would there be remain-
ing open?
COALS FOR ALL CREATION.
Br/BirtNG a candle at both ends is frugality itself compared to our
exportation, besides our consumption, of Coal. According to the
Custom House annual return, in the year 1872 there were 12,712,231
tons, value £9,858,418, exported from the United Kingdom. We
supplied France, Germany, Italy, Russia, India, Straits Settlements,
Ceylon, Egypt, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, and Holland with quan-
tities; for each, of from 468,424 to 2,152,527 tons. Of course the idea
of arresting the exportation of Coal is too absurd to be named,
except in joke; restraint of trade is not to be thought of, except as
a privilege to be freely exercised by Trades' Unions: and the law of
supply and demand must be let operate unchecked, and evacuate
our coal mines to supply the world with gas and steam. Whilst,
however, the coal of England is going at the rate of a galloping
consumption, the Committee now sitting on it under MR. AYBTON,
will doubtless pursue their diligent inquiries to great purpose.

FINANCE AND PHYSIC.
HA.T a shock-
ing disregard of
sound financial
• l and economical
principle was
exhibited byjtb.e
Austrian Gx>v-
ernment during
the late Panic
on the Bourse
at Vienna! The
Panic might
have been al-
lowed to run its
course; instead
of which, see
what was done,
by the account
of the Po«-Matt
Gazette .—
"The energetic efforts that are being made to ease the money-market at
Vienna, both by the Government and the leading bank* and credit institu-
tions, have had a steadying effect already in priees, as it is the difficulty which
individuals experience under such circumstances of meeting their immediate
engagements that usually gives rise to so much unnecessary mischief and
needless forced sales."
How much more like philosophical Statesmen would the EMPEROR
OF AUSTRIA'S advisers have shown themselves, if, instead of inter-
fering with the natural consequences of things in the money-market,
they had, on having been interrogated as to their intentions in the
emergency, contented themselves with replying, in the sublimely
curt cant of official stoicism, "That his Imperial Majesty's Ministers
did not consider themselves warranted by circumstances in making
any attempt to resist their progress;" or, in answer to a more
categorical question, that "They did not contemplate suspending
the Bank Act, or authorising the National Bank to issue "notes to any
amount above that already authorised by law." Half-a-dozen, at
least, of the leading firms in Vienna ought to have failed by this
time, and so, doubtless, they would, but for an intervention of
Ministers in a case of financial disturbance precisely like that prac-
tised by medical men in one of bodily disorder.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
On hit return he visits the Globe, and has a word to the wise about a
certain rendering of Sir Peter Teazle at the Vaudeville.
SIR,—My holiday is over. "I love the merry, merry sunshine,"
as the song used to say, and would now, were any one to sing it.
Not I, Sir: I cannot sing the old song.—I mean, I will not, and
there's an end on't. Now is the time for The Weather and The
Parks, the Dorking Coach or the Cochin' Dorking, and the thirty-
five drags which are to turn out for parade in Hyde Park on or
about this very time. Now the monotonous Cuckoo has commenced
his engagement in the provinces, the Foreign Nightingales are
warbling among the cut woods, the sets, and the flats, of Covent
Garden and Drury Lane, and the Jubilee Singers are airing their
hymns, and hymning their airs in Hanover Square. What wonder
that, my thoughts running thus on birds, I should, on returning to
this gay Metropolis, elect to represent Yon, Sir, at the Globe
Theatre, where there is just now being performed a play entitled
Fine Feathers, which amuses many, and puzzles not a few, with its
two or three Claimants, and its mysterious Elderly Gentleman
turning up in the last Act, imploring everybody who happened to
know who he really was, not to mention the fact to anybody else,
as he was going back again to wherever he came from—(I 'm not
sure he wasn't the Ghost out of Hamlet in a modern suit)—as soon
as possible. Your Representative'strongly advises the public to go
and solve for itself the following difficulties ;—Firstly, whether Mr.
Oriswold, the Agent, is a villain or not; secondly, whether'.Signor
Humbalino is, or has been, a scoundrel,—there isn't a doubt about
his being, in any case, an amusing rascal, as played by MR. COMPTON;
thirdly, is Mr. Clithero, a Lawyer, a thorough blackleg, or only a
sharp practitioner with an eye to the main chance; fourthly, is
Doctor Gfopple a wicked old humbug, or only a mild social impostor;
fifthly, is Lord Oadderly an idiot, or a knave; sixthly, is Harry
Gfreville more a good fellow than a bad fellow, or both by turns, and
nothing particular at last?
Daniel Dole, "the Chaucerian Comique," is well played by MB.
E. W. GARDEN, and seems far more worthy of Miss Ruth's hand
than is the vacillating hero who ultimately obtains it—which is
remarkably trae to nature.
MR. MONTAGUE is fond of feathers. False Shame was first called
the White Feather, and, as Your Representative, Sir, I may be
allowed to express a hope that this new piece may prove another
feather in his managerial cap.
Before settling down to my regular Representative work of the
Season (and what a deal there is to be got through!}, I wish to ask
a question respecting the performance of the Screen Scene in the
School for Scandal.
From the moment of the fall of the screen up to his reconciliation
with Lady Teazle, MR. FARREN represents Sir Peter as utterly
heart-broken by the discovery of his wife's supposed infidelity.
The picture thus presented evokes from the audience a feeling of
kindly pity for the old man, whom, till then, they had been
inclined to ridicule. Had SIIEKIIHN brought down his curtain at
this point, as I fancy many a modern dramatist would have been
tempted to do. an audience would have been electrified by the shook
of this most dramatic situation, the force of which comes with the
greater effect, because the transition from the preceding light and airy
pleasantries of comedy, to a situation lying on the border land of
tragedy, has been so sudden, and so startling. Charles's badinage has
a harsh and jarring sound after this: nay, it robs him of what is
supposed to be his one redeeming quality, his good-heartedness, and
makes him a careless, loose-living spendthrift, who can maunder on
occasion about a portrait of his uncle in Calcutta, but who possesses
neither sufficient respect for himself, nor for his father's old friend
and his own guardian, to restrain himself from the most cruel levity
in the presence of what he must actually perceive from Sir Peter's
woe-stricken face, and attitude of utter prostration, to be a grief too
overwhelming for words. If MB. FARREN'S admirable reading, and
no less admirable acting of this scene be correct (I believe it is accord-
ing to paternal tradition, but this is not all-important) then SHERI-
DAN was wrong in allowing Charles Surface to nave another word in
that scene. Charles, good-hearted and generous, should have been
made to share his guardian's grief, and stand aside silently. But the
truth, I suppose, is that the pathos of the situation never once
occurred to SHERIDAN. Sir Peter was an old fool, who had married
a young wife, and was fair game for the town. SHERIDAN gives
him no peace; he makes even Sir Oliver and sly old llowley indulge
in a laugh at Sir Peter's expense. Here, I take it, is an instance
of the thoroughly conscientious artist being, in his generation, wiser
than the author was, and such an author as SHERIDAN, in his.
Your Representative has been there, and still would go. for this
great Screen Scene, as now played by MESSRS. FARRBN, CLAYTON.
H. NEVILLE, and Miss AMT FAWSITT; but—with that picture of
utter hopelessness depicted on MR. FARREN'S countenance, with that
blank dismay of Joseph Surface, that shamefaoedness of Lady
Teazle, fearful of raising her eyes from off the ground, that look of
mingled surprise and (to interpret it by my own idea) regret on
Charles's face—with these, I say, freshly impressed on my mind,
let me get quit of the Theatre, ere Charles's cruel laughter, and
vulgar mockery, jar upon my ear and dispel the charm.
The truth is, SHERIDAN intended the Screen Scene to be farcical
from beginning to end, and Charles Surface strikes, throughout, the
key-note, with which the others must play in harmony. SHERIDAN
was as brilliant as a diamond—and as hard: he risked everything
for a laugh, and obtained it at all hazards. The Sir Peter of
SHERIDAN is not a trusting husband, heart-broken by his lady's
faithlessness, but an old beau, severely wounded in his most vulner-
able point—his egregious vanity—by the publicity of his wife's/auar
pas. Mil. FARREK'S intensity is, in Your Representative's humble
opinion, irreconcilable with SHERIDAN'S frivolity. To be consistent,
either the actor who adopts this serious view must sacrifice SHERI-
DAN, and have the curtain dropped on the situation (and here I
sincerely sympathise with the actor), or he must enter into SHERI-
DAN'S humour, and be more concerned for the inevitable scandal
out-of-doors, than for the death-blow, which, he would otherwise
have us believe, his faith in man's friendship, and his trust in
woman's love, have so unexpectedly received.
I may be wrong: if so, ayez pitiS de mot, for I speak as
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
A WELL-SPENT WEDNESDAY.
MB. COWPER TEICPLE did service to the cause of freedom by caus-
ing last Crotchet Day (Wednesday) in the House of Commons to be
occupied with the discussion of his Occasional Sermons Bill; discus-
sion serviceable all the rather that the Bill was rejected. This
measure was intended to enable professed Dissenters to preach, on
invitation, in Church pulpits. If enacted, it would perhaps effect
some little addition to the diversities of doctrine already preached
by the conforming Dissenters amongst whom the Church is divided.
Next year, perhaps, somebody else will reintroduoe it, or something
like it, to be discussed and rejected again. In the meanwhile, time
will have been consumed in harmless talk which might have been
misemployed in unnecessary legislation imposing new restrictions
on the liberty of the subject under pains and penalties.

A LIGHT the fewer in our firmament!
A light that unto many on their way,
Else darkling, a sure polestar's guidance lent,
Dies from our night, before the wished-for day.
New radiance from that fountain none shall see;
Bat as we bask in beams of some great star
Long ages after it has ceased to be—
Such time take rays to reach us from BO far,—
Thus, for the generations yet unborn,
This now quench'd star the darkness may shine through,
Till what seem'd foolish-false to purblind scorn,
By stronger light is known as wise and true 1
And if the star whose setting we bewail
Some but an unsubstantial meteor hold,
Because it lighted paths beyond their pale,
Let not our reverence for that grow cold.
If e'er man's soul was star-like, his was BO;
It burned so calmly, in such limpid air;
Gave out so pure and passionless a glow.
As scarce our earth's refraction seemed to share.
Strange that this mind, so high and calm and clear,
So set on heights whence e'en great things seem small,
Small shrink to nought, such soaring wings could rear,
On food that earthy one were apt to call.
From warm beliefs and haunting fancies barred,
Under the ferule of a rigid rule,
On manly brain-food e'en from childhood reared,
In the bare-walled Utilitarian school.
Early inured to more than private cares,
Near those who held the helm of empire set,
From boyhood conversant with great affairs,
The calm of large minds, small ones' f ass and fret.
So for long years he lived two lives abreast,
The life he fell upon, the life he sought:
To him, from work of Indian rule 'twas rest
To map wealth's currents, sound the depths of thought.
Till he who of our time was widest styled
"Philosopher," for sovereignty or scorn,
Office laid down, and from his books beguiled,
Was to loud hustings and loose Commons borne.
Wise was he, or unwise, his lamp to bear,
With its dry, pale, pure light, athwart the draughts
Of that rude place, into the smoky glare
That serves the work-day politicians' crafts?
Who says unwise, the Commons more condemns
Than the one wise man in their ranks astray:
If dunghill cooks for barley-corns slight gems,
What matter to men's minds that wiseUer weigh?
'Twai well, methinks, that men this man should Bee
Leaving the heights of abstract thought, hard won,
For levels, where, though foul and dark they be,
Our England's day's work daily must be done.

behalf, with reference to the threatened demonstration of London
Trades, saying that, inasmuch as the Legislature has sanctioned that
sort of thing:—
"The Trades' Council trust, therefore, that it will not be premature to ask
you to be good enough to hare erected, in some suitable position, a platform,
which might "IB uaed by the speakers on the occaiion of the demonstration of
the London Trades' Societies in Hyde Park on Whit-Monday next. This
would prevent the necessity of improvised platform or platforms by us, and
-'•mill remain as a permanent platform for similar useful purposes in the
future."
MB. AYBTON, who can be courteous enough to the striking and
menacing classes, and reserves his rude answers for gentlemen
whom he needs not fear, civilly replied to this! request that he had
no power to comply with it, and referred his correspondent to His
Royal Highness the Ranger. He might have told the representative
of the London Trades that the demand that Government should
erect a structure which would at once commemorate and subserve
their own humiliation, constituting a monumental whipping-post
for their occasional chastisement, was decidedly premature. The
date of the letter containing it was the 6th instant; when the
thermometer was below 60°. The weather was then not yet nearly

speech
FBOM a statement made by MB. GEOBGE ODOEB, in a speech
addressed, the other evening, to an assembly of shoemakers at
Woolwich, it appears that there is a remarkably good time coming,
whilst a pretty good time has already come, tor that description
of working men. "No trade," MB. ODOEB told his hearers, " had a
better prospect than theirs, for it was well known that journeyman
shoemakers were getting scarcer every year, and consequently their
individual value was increasing, while the fact that no apprentices
were joining the trade would make them scarcer and more valuable
still. Nothing like leather, then, for a layman of the working class
to get a living by. As for a curacy, the position of a journeyman
shoemaker is infinitely preferable to that of a journeyman parson;
and your cobbler's is the only remunerative cure of soles.

WE said the other day that we seldom quoted, except when in a
state of admiration. That word, in the sense of "wonder," describes
our condition on reading the following extract. And yet what wise
man wonders at clerical idiotcy, coupled with caddish insolence?
Look at what a " religious" newspaper has to say abont the great
and good man whose loss all but bigots lament. The Church
Herald says:—
"MB. J. STUART MILL, who has juet gone to his account, would have been
a remarkable writer of English, if hit innate aelf-consoiouanwe and abounding
relf-confidence had rot made him a notorious literary prig. His ' philosophy,'
so called, wa« thoroughly anti-Christian; bis sentiments daringly mischievous
nnd outrageously wild. As a Member of Parliament he was a signal failure.
His death is no loss to anybody, for he was a rank but amiable infidel, and a
most dangerous person. The sooner those ' light* of thought' who agree with
him, go to the tame place, the better will it be, both for Church and State."
We do not apologise for quoting this stupid malignity, offensive
as it will be to every reader of Punch. It is well that decent and
rational people should know in what brutality a certain form of
priestly mind can revel. We say "priestly mind," for whether the
animal who penned the above disgrace the Church or the laity, the
perpetration was intended to please a certain knot of ignorant priests
and their wretched.toadies. Olet!
A Sovereign Remedy.
AMONG the contents of the Medical Review and Invalidf Guide
is specified " Gold and its Compounds in the Treatment of Skin
Diseases." Of all cutaneous affections about the most unpleasant
that anybody but a billionnaire could be afflicted with would be one
requiring to be treated with gold. What with fees and what with
physio, such a complaint would be awfully expensive. That is to
say, unless, indeed, gold and its compounds, in the treatment of
skin diseases, are efficacious as remedies altogether of the homo j-
pathio kind, and require to be employed only in infinitesimal doses.
COMPLIMENTARY CHEMISTRY.
THE interests of sweetness, in connection with light, will be pro-
moted by a discovery thus recorded by the Medical Preis and
Circular .—
"ANILINE.—M. LANOORROIS hoi found that putrefaction, and decomposi-
tion of animal matters can be prevented, even when exposed to the air and at
an elevated temperature, by the use of small quantities of aniline, or the
colouring matter got from coal-tar."
Coal-tar, being a product of gas-manufacture, may be considered
as allied to light, and, as aniline is capable of being employed as a
disinfectant, sweetness may be supposed to be typified by that.
Observe, dear old lady, that aniline is a substance obtained from
indigo as well as from coal-tar, and that anil is one of the names of
the indigo plant; so that sweetness and Ijght are not necessarily,
though they may sometimes be, M'm, associated with anility.

Birmingham Grammar School, where
grateful Science still adores her
EDWARD THE SIXTH'S holy shade, and
where the Marquis was afraid the

.. , , prevent adoration of a less Pagan
fcmd. go the plan was demolished. There is a story to the effect that an excellent Dissenter,
wno was one of the managers of the School, preferred to go fishing one fine morning
to attending to his dull duties, and that the Churchmen closed their ranks, and Dissent
never got another innings. If true, we like that Waltonian Schismatic very much—always
neglect business for pleasure, especially on a Derby Day.
The Commons voted money, and MB. GOSCHEN promised that there should be no more ships
of the Devastation type begun until we were quite sure that this vessel was all right. She
seems to be, but it would make any fellow nervous about going aboard her, to read the
unpleasant vaticinations of some of the sea-critics.
The Irish Peace Bill was read a Third Time, ME. Pin pointing out that most of the Irish
Members had always opposed the measure, and always been in a minority. A noteworthy
tapt, but let us not flavour the great National Holiday with any essence of hostile politics.
Ihe Irish Members are all jolly good fellows, and so are all the English ones, and we don't
know which we love most, the Scotch or the "Welsh.
Tuetday.—MR. GLADSTONE proposed, as usual, that Committees should not sit until two

Then came a Railway Debate, but it was clear that a " Count" was coming, and MR. JULIAN
UOLDSMITH delicately alluded to it as "a pending and well-known Parliamentary process."
it muted fare the first time, but on the second attempt, MR. MONTAGU CHAMBERS being up it
succeeded. Still, we trust that he will enjoy his lunch on the Downs.
Wedneiday.—Mr. Punch has the best possible excuse for treating this day's proceedings
briefly. A desperate attempt was made, in accordance with the dictates of the Sentimen-
talists, and of the strong-minded and disagreeable Women (whose pamphlets and placards on
the subject remind us that LORD CAMPBELL carried a certain Act), to abolish a certain
sanitary nMM Measure, which injures nobody, and works great good. Mr. Punch does
not feel inclined to go into the question, but he is happy to state that MR. BRUCE stood up
I2r t£e P<»i°e Measure, and that the Sentimentalists of the "shrieking Sisterhood" (we
thank the 8. R. for the phrase) were defeated by 251 to 128. There is good sense in the
majority of the House of Commons, and we hope that it will be as fortunate in shying at
Aunt Sally as it was in shying at the folly of the other old women of both sexes this
W ednesaay.

of the Government Rating Bill. It is enough to say that the Landed Interest rated the Ad-
minutration, and that the BUI wai read a Second Time, which the Debate certainly will not
TV trust the fresh air of Epsom will restore the liveliness of the orators.
inen we had some fun. To the Committee on the O'KEEFFE affair it was proposed that the
name of DH- L*°N PLATTAIR should be added. MR. GLADSTONE said that this would offend
fourmillions of Irishmen. The Housedidnot
seem to mind this, and inserted the learned
Scotch Doctor's name, by 200 to 182, and
then, in spite of further remonstration, put
on MR. CROSS, by 205 to 165. An Irish
Member declared that he would move to
put on MESSRS. NEWDEOATE and WHALLET.
But SIR PATRICK O-'BRIKN took a much
pleasanter mode of dealing with the matter,
and said it would cause merriment in Ire-
land. This is what we all desire to do,
Mr. Punch not only desiring it, hut nobly
contributing to that end. He hopes that
SIR PATRICK will have a capital place for
his Carriage, and win no end of Sweep-
stakes.
MR. BRUCE obtained leave to bring in a
Bill for appointing a Public Prosecutor.
At last! It was too late to explain the
provisions, but we heartily welcome the
attempt to do what ought to have been
done a century ago.
Friday.— Everything uninteresting, ex-
cept that Ma. WHALLET again brought up
the Tiehborne case, and described the fat
man, now being tried, as an unfortunate
Gentleman." Whoever he may be, he is
not that, and the House shouted with
laughter. "I must speak my conviction."
said MR. WHALLET.
A SUGGESTION.
_ Oira means taken by Counsel for inva-
lidating a witness's evidence is to ask him
"How much he is to be paid for his attend-
ance in this case?" Surely the witness
would be in his right were he to retort on
the cross-examining barrister with—" And
how much, Sir, are you to be paid for your
attendance in this case?" An honest wit-
ness comes in the interests of Justice, and
Justice herself takes the initiative of mak-
ing him some sort of pecuniary compensa-
tion for his loss of time, for his trouble and
personal discomfort. It is, however, a
theory that Counsel's fees are paid by way of
honorarium. _ Counsel, twitted in return by
an ill-used witness, may point to the theory,
but he wouldn't be abje to support it by in-
stancing his own practice. Aren't the Judges
paid, aren't the Law Officers paid, aren't the
Jury paid?
Horseflesh, and Grass.
You bet on yonder favourite steed,
My brethren; yet, for all his backers,
As well as every screw or weed,
He '11 one day go unto the knacker's. STIQQINS.
Communists and Cords.
ACCORDING to a telegram from Geneva,
relative to some Communist refugees lately
expelled from that city :—
"MM. CYEILLE and CCBURDUBOY were among
the expelled refugees."
It often happens that proper names are
peculiarly inappropriate. The name of
Cos ITBDUROT would be as suitable to a par-
tisan of Legitimate Monarchy as, in ap-
plication to a Communist, it is ironical.
CCEUBDUBOY sounds like a noble patro-
nymic, whereas Communists are cads, who
can only be associated with something like
it by the consideration that they have
sprung of ancestors who were accustomed
to wear corduroys.

How potent o'er-f agged statesmen to repair I
For innocence of all things that to course,
Or ring, or rape, or horse,

Or odds or book-makers, their loss or gain,
The frreenness of that turf might symbol be

Few things there he whereof I nothing know;
Still fewer, whereof ignorance I show;
Or knowing not a touch,
Acknowledge to as much,
But this, the Turf—its Kaces and its Ring,
Is such a thing!
But once to Epsom I,
Stole on the sly,
And, ill at ease for time so mishestowed,
Studied the humours of the road,
As between dusty hedgerows ran.
Miles upon miles of vehicle and van;
There my own flesh and blood beheld,
By strange delusion of the day impelled,
On drag, barouche, pab, van, and 'bus,
In aught but puris naturaKbus,
And wondered, 'mong the strange fish of those waves,
Were there more fools or knaves.
There, down the course, incog,
I saw the famous dog
Hush, tail between his legs, through ranks of scorn,
Like some poor Premier, borne,
By fate accurst,
Of the three courses, to essay the worst:
Who the line 'twi.v t antagonist extremes
In media ttttissimut misdeems,
But wakes to learn from foes and friends, all wroth,
He has pleased neither, but won howls from .both.
There, 'neath the crowded stand,
Which, why I know not, they call " grand,"
I marked the roaring, cursing, clamouring ring,
And in the pauses of the race,
With blackened face,
Heard pseudo-Christy-minstrels sing,
And felt, not irresponsive, the hot thrill
Sweep over down and hill,
And saw the great black mass turn sudden grey,
With a square mile of faces turned one way,
As the faint buzz " They 're off!" grew more and more,
Till it rose to a roar,
When round the corner, and the flat along,
Huge horses, gleaming riders, a great throng,
Bewildering ear and eye,
Swept, thundering, by,
And left me faint and white, as one that feels
Uncertain which is upmost, head or heels.
Then, for a moment's space, methought, I too.
Could feel the common frenzy that flashed through
Those thousand thousands of mixed multitude

TAKING THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE.
Dorothy. "I SHALL HAVE sues A BIO "WEDDING-CAKE WHEN I'if MARRIED, MUMMY!"
ChrislopTur. "YES—AND SET IT AFORE iff, WON'T YOU!"
And knew, awhile, why Politics and Gain,
Thus, spite of sense, are fain
To waive their claims, and once a year give place
To the brief madness of the Derby race.
That night a dream I dreamed,
Wherein I seemed
To be translated, not, as in the play,
Poor Bottom lay,
By Oberon so translated as to pass
From blockhead inte ass.
No, mine was such translation as should be,
Of W. E. G.
An elegant translation into Greek
More Attic than e'er Bottom wont to speak
Or any of those " rude mechanicals"
"Who "toiled for bread upon Athenian stalls."
Methonght with woollen tunic for sole wear,
I drove a classic chariot and pair.
Backed for a Derby, that in more than name,
"Was a right Isthmian Game,
Kim by Poseidon's Sicyonian shrine;
Its prize a simple garland of the pine.
In the two steeds that my proud chariot drew
Progress and Peace, a well-matched pair, I knew:
And Progress, fairest of my team to sight,
Was but " Gang Forward," thin year's favourite,
Under more classic name,
But breed and blood the same:
Methonght that for the race
We took our place,—
"Off I" and away we dart ....
Back again!—a false start!
And well it was that a false start 'twas given,
Or, all too-eager driven,
My chariot had sustained a fatal shock
Against the old Hibernian stumbling-block.
Now, we are off again—
With loose hair and tense rein,
We thunder, in a ruck, across the plain:
Still mine the foremost place
In that hot headlong race!
Past me the race-course spins and spins,
My fevered ear
The shout " Our WILLIAM; wins!"
Can hardly hear;
But what 'a this beat of hoofs that, from behind,
Comes borne upon the wind?
With sidelong glance thrown back
I note one on my track;
I know him now, mine enemy of old,
D'IsRAELius the bold,
Who from his gaudy car, with Sphinx-like stare,
His counsel still confined to his own breast,
Without or haste or rest,
Urges a piebald pair-
Ballot and Bung their name,—
(Of Bunkum and of Beer-barrel they came ;)
But, cocktails though they be,
And base of pedigree,
Driv'n by a driver that their paces knows,
And no allegiance owes
To aught beyond the purpose of the hour,
From steeds far nobler born than they,
The prize they well may bear away,
And sweep their dextrous charioteer to power.
Nearer and nearer still they came,—
I knew their wily driver's game,—
Sly creeping up and up, on my off-wheel.
Even now I seemed to feel

The hot breath of his horses past my cheek;
In vain I gasped in Greek
Cheer to my steeds, whose wind came short and thick,
As quicker and more quick
The artful D'IsRAELius forced the pace;
Till, from a waiting to a winning race,
Now, close upon my flank
I hear his chariot clank,
And hoof-beat answering hoof-heat,'team to team ;—
Now, neck and neck we steam,
"Wrapped each in the other's smoke;
And then I woke,
And found to my delight

will take place in Freema»on»' Hall, on Wednesday, May 28, The Right Hon. W. S. GLAD-
STONE, M.P., in the Chair. Dinner at half-past 6 for 7 precisely, at which hour the Chair

Great disappointment will be felt if the Right Honourable Chairman does
not arrive from the Course in time. The Winner of the Royal Literary Fund
Sweep will be announced immediately after the cloth has been drawn.
FOE THE FBUJAY.
THE song says, "PHILLIS is my only joy." Old MABTBT MAHEHAM, who has not
missed the Oaks for forty years, never omits to quote this line, but, with some
disregard of grammatical concord, makes it run thus—" Fillies is my only joy."
THE TUBF AFFECTIOH-.—'Ossification of the heart.
THE TEETOTAL "DBA.G;"
OR, THE GOOD TEMPLAR'S T0RN-OUT.
I UEVER have been to a play;
Bat once to a horse-race I went:
And never experienced a day
Than that one more usefully spent.
Though means are not hallowed by ends,
I felt that we should not do wrong
In going, a party of friends—
An example to offer the throng.
The Horse, noble creature, to see_
Competing in speed with his kind,
Of itself must a spectacle be
To elevate all of right mind.
We thought as spectators we might
Show others the way to abstain
From liquors which double the sight,
And likewise from gambling refrain.
We therefore a vehicle hired.
At a Temperance hostel in Town
We got furnished with all we required;
And so we drove cheerily down.
From trees on each side of the road,
And hedges, a feeling serene
Of exquisite sympathy flowed;
They were go delightfully green.
There yet were horse-chestnuts in bloom,
Of wtfioh we made innocent fun;
Remarking 'twas fair to presume
That some chestnut horses would run.
Arrived in the thick of the " drags,"
Our Whip, with humanity due,
To water assisted his nags;
We bade him to help himself too.
We sat and awaited the race.
Mild bets on the quadrupeds laid.
No money changed hands m our case;
With beans all our wagers were paid.
And when the event of the day
Had now been decided at last,
We laid out a portable tray,
And partook of a welcome repast;
All hungry as lions that growl
O'er a carcase of kid or of lamb.
And I ate a portion of fowl,
And with it a morsel of ham.
Meanwhile we indulged in a drop;
We could take it without any fear.
0, you should have heard our corks pop,
Lemonade some, and some ginger-beer I
We finished our temperate meal;
Descended, and strolled about, each.
A sudden emotion of zeal
Impelled me to stand up, and preach. .
Perhaps I feel some little doubt
The attempt was more zealous than wise.
My pockets were turned inside out;
My hat was knocked over my eyes,
And all my companions I found
Very much in a similar plight.
Distributing tracts on the ground,
They so got involved in a fight.
'Mong Roughs having ventured to roam,
Coats torn down the back they had got.
Youth bantered as all the way home
As a drunk and disorderly lot.
Yet that night on our pillows clear heads
With sweet self-content we could lay:
And in health sprang at morn from our beds,
None the worse for the Derby, next day.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
AH ENQUIRER asks the meaning of an inscription on
the Groat Northern Railway. "King's Cross, Seven
Bisters Road." King has a right to be cross if his
seven sisters rode and he had to walk.
F. P.—Peckham Wrvwas so named from the extremely
crooked ways of the ancient colonists there. We are
unaware whether any amendment haa taken place.
FASTIDIOUS JAMES.—It ia not strictly etiquette, when a
gentleman declines to dine with you, on the ground
of being engaged, to write in reply that you believe
that's all humbug, and that he hopes for a pleasanter
invitation, but your answer would of ten be truthful.
KJ.\, IT v, QUIA, who write on the same subject. It Is
most ungenerous to your friend to accept his invita-
tion, if going will bore you. Gire him credit for
desiring tbat you should do what will make you
happiest, and stay away.
Miss SAPPHO.— If you think that you can sing better
than Madame Patti, there is not the least objection
to your getting over from the stalls into the orchestra,
and thence to the stage (the Big Drum is politeness
itself, and he will heave you up), and trying. But
courtesy demands that you should wait the fall of
the Act-drop, and perhaps you had better obtain a
written permission from Mr. Gye.
VOLPIOIUS.—Nonsense about "no end." Everything
has an end except eternity, and Wimpole Street, W.
A. Hooo. —You say that, like Bacon, you take all
knowledge to bo your province. All your knowledge
appears to us to be provincial.
Fi DELIS.—Never betray a secret. But there is no law
against your making a memorandum of a secret, for
your own use; and, if you happen to write with a
thick pen, and promptly to use the blotting-pad, to
which the head Club Gossip is sure to resort, it will
be the fault of the puper- makers, not yours, if he
reads, and tolls. We knew an objectionable marriage
prevented by such an—accident.
K \, F.—You must not send ecclesiastical jokes to us.
Your statement that you went to Church on the 18th,
and, having to sit in the aisle, you thought that day
VMS de-Rogation Sunday, betokens anything but
proper feeling. ''All equal are within the Church's
gate," says George Herbert.
ANTI-FIDDLER.—Ha I hat "'Music hath charms to
soothe the savage breast,' and to irritate every other,"
is not ba 1, for you But cotton-wool is cheap enough,
and staying at home is cheaper.
IMPATIENT HESTER.—When Hamlet said "Those that
are married already, all but one, shall live," it is cer-
tain tbat he meant, when King of Denmark, to pro-
vide meana of living for such couples as had wedded
on insufficient incomes. But don't you and " Dear
Tom" marry on the idea that anything of the sort
will be done for you. Wait, and hope to get tired of
one another.
Qui s'ExcusE.—Letters intended to be delivered never
miscarry. Misdirect carefully, if for any reason you
desire your epistle to go astray, and be returned to
you, that you may show It when the mischief you
wish it thought you tried to prevent is done. If you
ought to write to Leicester Square, omit " Square,"
and your letter will make a pleasant tour into the
Midlands.
VIATRIX.—No such word, Miss, and you shouldn't ask
us questions you can answer from your MangnalL
However, par nobtte fratrum means, "Pa's brother
is a nubleman;' currente calamo is a nursery bint,
'• calomel in currant jelly;" nemine diuentiente
means " No man should be a Dissenter;" and •- , ,. -n-
mutantur (giro me) " tha /*..-. and my change."
WopptRS.—Now, do you think we shall go to the Derby
for pleasure? Do not misjudge us. We go, firstly,
because we wish to encourage the breed of English
horses (we may back a foreigner, but that's a detail);
secondly, because it costs us nothing; thirdly, bo-
cause we accompany a young friend, whom we wish
to keep out of temptation; fourthly, because, we
particularly wish to speak to a man, on business;
fifthly, because workmen happen to be doing some-
thing in our study; sixthly, because we want a little
fresh air; and, seventhly, because wo do not wish
to discourage our follow creatures too much by show-
ing ourselves superior to all thoir enjoyments. But,
pleasure!
AMPIJIBIOUS.—Never change your opinion about any-
thing. But, 4» the object of talking is to annoy
somebody, express whatever opinion is likely to be
most distasteful to your hearers. If anybody colls
you inconsistent, punch his head.
AMOR VIRTUTIS.—Make all cheques payable to "order."
Many persons will overlook this, and many others
may not know th.it it demands an endorsement, Bo
your balance will remain handsomer a little longer.
A RIGHTFUL HEIR.—With pleasure. Send us all your
papers, and wo will read them carefully, and, if
necessary, obtain our Solicitor's opinion for you.
"Else, wherefore breathe we in a Christian World?"
or, rather, what eUe U the duty of an Editor?
Soorua.—The lines are In Burns' works, but they are
only an amplification of Dr. Watta's terse and elegant
couplet:
"If I could tee what other* tie,
A better cove I think f'd be."
YOUNG POLITICIAN.—You know that a married man
may sit in Parliament, but you want to know
whether a single man can marry while he is in the
House of Commons? Certainly not. It would inter-
rupt public business, and Mr. Brand would not be
pleased to have a swarm of gauzy bridesmaids
flirting with the representatives of the nation.
NI-MA.—You win your bet Every Member of the
Athenaium Club is a contributor to the Athenamm
journal. Before election he must produce six articles
which have been published. Four grammatical
errors black-ball him. Hence the Members of the A.
speak and writo purer English than those of any
other Club.
DR. CULLEN.—The next Pope will bo Cardinal Pane-
bianca. He is a member of the house of Whitbreod,
and his graudfather left England in a rage at
Canning's famou* squib about the apotheosis of the
then head of the family. '' And the Angels all cried,
'Here's old Wlutbread a coming!'"
F. S. A.—Stocks Market was the old Stock Exchange.
Tho original stocks, from which it took name, may
be seen at tho present Exchange any day from 11
to 4, unless a broker happens to bo in them. The
Committee man who shows them expects a trifling
douceur.
R. t -.—An anchovy, nicely rolled up, and inserted into
an olive, vice the stone, ia to bo praised, and so is the
person who gives it you. But, for more reasons than
one, wo should like to see the white fingers of our
hostess herself preparing this relish.
A YOCNO PUBLISHER.—Morocco leather ia made of goat
skin, but that is no reason for putting costly binding
on books for kids. In answer to your second ques-
tion, the banns uf marriage ore the only thing pub-
lished without puffs, and they are no exception if
the list is long and the parson is wheezy.
ApUD.--Your Shaksperian suggestion has its value.
We incline to the old reading, "all the region-kites,"
but y«u think Uamlet said,
"I should have fatted all theRtgent'a Park
With this ilave. Awful!"
That Hamlet died about eight hundred years ago,
while the Park did not receive its name till 1812, we
do not think much of an objection, knowing how
little Shakspeare minded an anachronism when he
could make a point. But we see more difficulty in
the fact that the poet himself died before tho name
was given. 11 is a curious thing, however, that there
are no fat persons in the Regent's Park.
J. LOMAX.—Not quite accurate. The linen, as Isaac
Watts, D.D., wrote them, run thus :—
"Why? \Vert our garment* made to hide?
For ','<„<. let't put them on with pride,
Nor reckon dreu anion-y the tint:
Wketice caiiudear Sce'tJifU robes oftlciM f"
TECHNICAL— In 1862 Mr. Snewing's Caractacug. But
you should be too correct a cuss to think that was
the year it was suewing during the race.
SCRUPULOUS.—There is no objection to shooting a street
organist, but do not fire out of window when any
body else is about, lest you injure a fellow-creature.
SIR WILFRID 1,. -In Sumatra it is with the greatest
difficulty that a native can be got to pronounce his
own name. There is not this etiquette in Eng-
land, but towards the evening of the Derby Day a
good many persons appear to be Sumatrans, to the
extent in question.
ALFONSO. — We have carefully gone through the
"' Lives," and we do not find a single instance in
which a parson who rode in a public horse-race ulti-
mately became Archbishop of York. This is the
more remarkable, as Yorkshire is pre-eminently a
sorting county.
L. J. M.—You did not send the stamps, which was a
bore, because at the moment we happened to wont
some, but your poem would equally have gone into
the waste-paper oasket. Where is your right to give
us the slightest trouble?
A DEJECTED WIFE.—We can give no advice about
marking-ink. Besides, respectable washerwomen
now decline to work for penons who ore mean
enough to mark their linen, and thus not only show
a want of confidence, but give the trouble of sorting
the things.
P. F. S.—What do you send such "talented young
friends J' to us for? You said he was an educated
man. He mentioned the Laureate's poem, St. Simon,
and sounded Stylites as if it rhymed to skylights.
We threw coals at him, and the Commissioner shoved
him into the street Do be more considerate.
AK ARTIST.—Your sketch of " Nature making her first
effut" is pretty, but we don't believe that lizards
originated In that way.
THESPIS.—Yea, true. A late great Actor was rehearsing
the play of William Tell, and he said, in so very col-
loquial a manner, to the man who brings him the
little apple, "Do you shoot?" that the artist quite
forgot where he was, and answered, "A little, Sir;
but, strange to say, I never had a go with one of
them rum cross-bows."
CRETAN.—We know one solution of your " mystery," but
we are never rude on a Derby Day. We leave that
sort of thing to the canaille on the road. Still, if you
can think of a good rhyme to pie, eye, and shy, it is
at your service.
GULES.—If any friends with lunch in their carriage
offer you gooseberry tort, having previously given you
Derby champagne, you can say, "false heraldry,"if
you like. They won't understand, but if you wink
they will think you mean something clever.
K A. PYBUS.—Verses distinctly declined. Ascot does
not rhyme to white waistcoat.
LE COHTE D'A .—" The dual function of the brain"
is, we imagine, to keep a man with brains out of a
duel
A YOUNG M.P.—The Colltern Hundreds are not in-
cluded in the estimates, but are paid by- the Speaker
out of his Salary. The payment means a reward to a
Member of Parliament for making room for a better
man. The form of offering it is defined in the Stand-
ing Orders. The Speaker calls to the member, and
says, in a friendly way, '' The House is very hot, let
you and I go and take a chill turn or two along tho
Terrace." It is high treason to refuse.
LADY ETHEL.—We have seen beautiful models of the
Koh-i-Noor in Regent Street, but we do not advise
you to wear one as an ornament when you are pre-
sented to Her Majesty. Imitation ia the sincerest
flattery, but the highest personage in the realm has
no toleration for flattery. You can hire plenty of
diamonds, if you are so miserable as not to have a lot,
and if that is the case, you are not the sort of person
who ought to have ventured on writing to us.
STUDENT.—The question whether Mary Queen of Scots
was sincere, or only politic, in refusing the hand of
Louis XIV., has ofton been discussed. We are not
inclined to give a positive opinion, where Lingord
doubts and Pinnock generalises, but we have reason
to think she would have married him, but for the
strange conduct of Talleyrand, who instigated tho
Sicilian Vespers in order to divert the attention of
Europe from Mary's affair with Crasar Borgia.
MARIA.—You ask who "Glossary the Poet" was. You
have seen his works indicated on the back of the
Volume containing Chaucer, Oower, and Skolton.
Quite right to ask. He is a very nice poet, and has
this advantage, that he explains every word he uses,
which several moderns do not do.
SCIENTIFIC.—We never hod the slightest idea as to
what is meant by pressure on the barometer, and wo
have lived a good many years, very comfortably,
without knowing. We believe, however, that if you
press it too hard, it will break, and the quicksilver
will tumble all over the floor, and this produces a
pretty effect.
B. L. M.—No real gentleman compose* a telegram In
any carter or terser form than he would adopt in a
note. The telegram was intended to facilitate com-
munication, not to dovelope meanness. The Ameri-
cans ore better behaved in this matter than most
Englishmen, and simply write a letter with the wire
Instead of the pen.
STENTUK complains that he was "turned out of St.
Paul's Cathedral merely for shouting, to try the
echoes of the dome while service was going on."
What could you expect from tyrannical priests and
their dastardly vassals? Ask Mr. Peter Taylor to
bring your cose before Parliament.
RUSTIC us JUNIOH.—Sunday is not the Sabbath, but
that is no reason why you should select that day for
taking the nests of unfortunate little birds, and we
are very glad that the keeper horsewhipped you.
EDWARD J.—From the "specimen of your hand-
writing " we should say that you were on idiot, but
that a person needs some brains to spell with such
ingenious atrocity. Your sentiments are beneath
contempt, and, the way you fold your note is vulgar
in the extreme. We think that you are " calculated
to shine/' but our present shoe-black is a faithful lad,
and we shall not part with him while his merits are
so much superior to your own.
OXFORD DON,— We agree with you. The Romans used
wafers. They had no " w," but spelt aa well as they
could, poor Pagans. Horace expressly mentions the
article:—
'• -(Vex, ti vafer uniu t? alter."
OTHER COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED : — VETUS (old

UNCH had the greatest pleasure in receiving the ac-
counts of MR. UEOHOE SMITH'S splendid successes in
Assyria. His diicorery of ancient tablets and other
records, and his masterly interpretation thereof glad-
dened our soul, and we said in the purest Assyrian, a
tongue known to Oureelf alone, " Somitat men ihad-
doeky Va»h gimmy snork dubbbtoether," which means,
"The noble and learned SMITH shall discover some-
thing for Us." We waived the slight detail of ap-
plying to the British Museum or to the Daily Telegraph upon the subject,
as we knew that both would be proud and delighted at our availing our-
selves of the services of their illustrious Envoy. We telegraphed to
Mu. SMITH, and invited him to ascertain whether he could not find a
Prophecy or two that would be useful to us for the Derby, especially as one
of our regular Prophets has fiercely abjured all sporting topics, and the other
is gone to Vienna. We had a most delightful answer from Mosul. MR.
SMITH has come upon a tablet containing about two Columns of Prophecy,
prepared by a Babylonian Astronomer, who lived in the reigns of Kimini-
jiminy and Belligofuster, and, though it is partially damaged, he has been
able to make out as much as is needful. The Babylonian Prophet will be
found quite as safe a guide aa any of the Ouessers at home, who give you a
of prophecy in a sack full of circumbendibus and slang. We translated the inscriptions ourselves, in order to save Mu. SMITH as much trouble as
but we need hardly say that the British Museum and the Daily Telegraph are heartily welcome to make whatever use they please of our
This is the translation :—
In the reign of a good Queen,
Severed, beloved,
By the Sea-island made of Chalk,
Shall the horses be brought forth;
And her son, even her eldest son, shall
look on,
As the fiery beasts strive for the prize.
The great cry shall go up,
And men's hearts shall be in a blaze.
All shall run, but one only shall re-
ceive the prize.
It shall be called the Silken Ribbon,
And its hue shall be that of the
heavens
As they rarely show in the Sea-isle of
Chalk.

And urge on their steeds furiously,
Calling on such Gods as they worship,

And inviting woes upon the ocular

While the roar goeth up as of the Sea,
And thieve! do not the work negli-

And the names of the horses shall be

But not as the winner shall be hailed.
Him, the savage beast of spots,

Him named from the hot fiend,
Him named from the cold vegetable,

Dog,
Him who is as one that measnreth,
Him who tumbleth head over heels,
Him who recalls a King of Orient.
Let such as please put forth their

Of the hue seldom seen in the Chalk-

Verily, he who hath taken his fine
gold,
And «aid, it shall be wager on one of

Let him, if that he may,
Leap into the leafy fence of the road,
As did the Wise Man of Islington.
But of the more potent striven,
Among whom the Stars point out
Him urged to speed by a Sawney voice,
Him named from the King of Occident,
Him of the haughty step,
Him of the place where asses move
about,
Him whose name rhymeth,
In the tongue of the Chalk-islanders,
To grand o«s,
Let him who would garner his gold
Select one, on whom the Stars look
down,
And let him take his fine gold,
And wager it on that animal, saying,
In a loud voice and a bold,
As one who feareth the face of none,
And, having an opinion, sticketh unto
it,
As the wax clingeth to the Cobbler's
thread,
As the Limpet clingeth to the rock,
As the Woman clingeth to folly and
finery,
Let him upraise his cry,
And put his linn gold
(Tu-o illegible Una.)
So shall his Wife rejoice when he
r< turns,
And smile though he stagger,
And take the farthing Idols from his
hat,
And with her own hand kindle the
sacrifice,
Even the burnt offering for his lips,
And he shall win and shall not lose.
And his household shall rejoice with
This prophecy made I,
Bollifocus, the Son of Longsnouto,
In the reign of my Lord
King Belligofuster the Uncompro-
mising.
And it shall be for a sign and a token
Until the dajs of the good Queen
That sitteth in the Chalk Isle of the
I Sea.
BLEST BEYOND DOUBT.
LET us drink the health of Ilia Holiness the POPE, and many
happy returns to him of his eighty-first birthday, the 13th inst.
The venerable Pontiff is, indeed, better; seemed so. at least, when,
the other day, he received the Dean and Chapter of the Basilica of
Santa Maria in Trastevere. He was, however, still not strong, and,
says a contemporary, "he excused himself on this account towards
the canons for not rising from his chair when he imparted to them
his apostolic benediction." No doubt the reverend gentlemen would
have rejoiced to see the Holy Father on his legs again; at the same
time they could not have received his blessing with the less confi-
dence in its efficacy for that it was delivered ex cathedra.
Respect for the Day.
SIIA KSPRA UK, by the mouth of Ophelia, speaking of rue, tells us
that " yon may call it herb of grace on Sundays." He makes the
Clmen in Twelfth Night swear by St. Anne that "ginger shall be
hot i' the mouth, too. In case that comedy were ever performed
on the Derby Day, it would only be decorous of the actor who
ordinarily makes the remark last quoted to vary the reading, and,
instead of " ginger," to say "horfe-radisb."

RETROSPECTIVE RACING.
THE Derby Day was over;
The Derby had been won;
And many a thousand pounds beside;
But I had betted none.
And I said, "The Race which Doncaiter,
The outsider, ran so fast,
Is gone away, like Herr Sreitmann't beer,
Into the eternal past.
"My Christian friends, what matter P
That need not bar our game,
For the Derby we can have our Sweep,
Though 'tis over, all the same.
Pay down your stakes, 0 brethren dear,
And your horses draw by lot;
We can bet on the race that hath been run,
As well as though it had not."
We wrote the horses' names down,
And the papers folded up.

To win a plate or cup.

CASTRO, otherwise ORION, has addressed an appeal for

times said to be a jewel, but there would be more pro-

under_an alias, that wins the Derby? For endurance
there is no horse to equal Fair play; but is it impossible
to ride Fair play to death f
PRIVATE VIEWS.
PRIVATE Views of Academies, International Exhibitions, Water-
Colour Societies, Performing Spiders, &c., are all very delightful,
and highly conducive to a better acquaintance with the principles
and practice of Art; but there are some other Private Views for
which we should like to be favoured with a card, such as the
following:—
A Private View of MR. AYBTOW in the act of inspecting the pro-
gress of the new Law Courts.
A Private View of CARDINAL CULLEN perusing LORD CHIEF
JUSTICE WHTTESIDB'S charge to the jury in the O'Keeffe trial.
A Private View of the countenance of the CHANCELLOR OF_ THE
EXCHEQUER when he receives a large remittance for Conscience
Money (Income-tax).
A Private View of the REV. ABRAHAM ADAMSON when his eye
falls on an advertisement of the sale of the next presentation to the
living of which he is the present incumbent, giving full particu-
lars of his age, health, and growing infirmities.
A Private View of the faces of the leading electors of Peterborough,
when they read of some fresh eccentricity on the part of their
Member, ME. WHALLEY.
A Private View of SEBASTIAN SMEARY, R.A., studying the
not over-complimentary opinions of the critics on his pictures in the
Royal Academy.
A Private View of the wondering expression on the face of the
SHAH OF PERSIA, when he is informed that the Corporation of
London are going to give him a gold box of the value of one hundred
guineas. (His Majesty's wonder will be redoubled should he be
solicited to become a " Fishmonger " or a " Coachmaker.")
A Private View of the average British farmer, poring over his
weekly paper, and conscientiously endeavouring to understand the
present aspect of French politics.
A Private View of the three Judges in the TICHBORNE case, when
they are talking it over among themselves.
YOU. UOV. A
A Private View of the Leader of the Opposition, when he receives
the news of another Conservative victory.
A Private View of BLANCHE HATHERTON, reading a letter from
her bosom friend, ISABEL GATBFORD, in which she announces her
engagement to SIR LAWRENCE GOLDIE, with whom they were both
staying in the same country house during the Christmas holidays.
A Private View of the lucky man who backed Doncaster for the
Derby, several times over, when he stood at 40 to 1.
A COOL FISH.
IT will be within the recollection of many persons that, a few
years ago, in this Town, a certain Showman professed to exhibit
a Talking Fish. The Showman was not BABNUH; nor was the
Talking Fish an importation from the United States. But now
we have to admire a Writing Fish in the person of MR. FISH,
the American Minister. This Fish has addressed his colleague,
M it. BANCROFT, in a State paper containing a hint that SIR A. COCK-
BURN'S objection to the retrospective rule, under which England
was oast at Geneva in Alabama damages, might become " available
in a possible future to the United States." But is it meant to be
made so P If the Alabama damages are paid before this question
has been answered, English diplomacy, in relation to American,
will so far answer to DR. JOHNSON'S definition of angling, that it
will be something which has had a Fish at one end and a Fool at
the other.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
RACIOUS Message was brought down, Monday, May 26,
by the Lord Steward. The UCKKN wag pleased to
aay that, in compliance with the request of her
Faithful Lords, she would not assent to the Bir-
mingham School scheme. When that excellent Dis-
senter, of whom we spoke last week, went a fishing
instead of attending to the School, how little he thought
that his Waltonian propensity would, in the time to
come, cause such magnificent n suits,—a grand reform
scheme, a lordly debate, a ministerial defeat, and a
Message from the QUEEN. The "gods and little
fishes were never more curiously connected. We
hope he had good sport.
On the Rook of Cashel, which is about 300 feet high,
are some very interesting ruins, of ecclesiastical cha-
racter. The Rock was fortified by BRIAN BOROIMHE,
the ancestor of every Irish family that goes in for
pedigree. There was a Cathedral that wag burned by
the KAKL OF KILDABE in 1495, but his Lordship apo-
logised to the King in the handsomest way, saying that
he would certainly not have fired the place, but that
he had thought the Archbishop was inside. The King
was go pleased at thig highbred frankness that he imme-
diately made K i LIU HE Lord Lieutenant. The various
ruins are among the best things in Ireland. Therefore,
of course, it is proposed to spoil them, and LoED STAN I,K v
of Alderley moved the Second Reading of a Bill for en-
abling restorations to be made. There was rather a
good debate. LORD BHODKICK opposed the measure. A
sum of £7000 has been set apart, under the Irish Church
Act, for the maintenance of the monuments, and LORD
GiiAjm LLK and a large majority of the Peers thought
that the new arrangements ought not to be disturbed.
The Bill was thrown out by 112 to 23.
Some more Tramway Legislation took place. Those
huge machines are a dreadful nuisance, and it is a
mercy that, on the Derby Day, tin y did not kill a
considerable instalment of the population. They are
all very well in a small place like Vienna, and we
believe that they much conduce to the comfort of
visitors to that Exhibition. But they make travelling
on the London roads a matter of exceeding peril. _ We
hope that their extinction is only a question of time;
at present, speculators are tramway mad, and we only
wonder that nobody has proposed to make one of these
ways from one end of St. Paul's to another, to save visitors the
trouble of walking across.
It was mentioned that the Devastation is to be accompanied
by the Carron, afterwards by the Valorous, lest she should
come to any grief on her trial trip. She has gone out expressly
to put herself in the way of the Atlantic Swell. Who he is,
we are not informed.
Some clever Tea-sellers have christened their article " Post-
Office Tea," and caused it to be sold by postmasters, so that the
B. P. may suppose—just what the B. P. likes. MR. MONSELL
has prevented a medallion, in imitation of the postage-stamp, from being
affixed to the packets, but that is all he can do. We really do not see
why he should do anything. If the tea is bad or adulterated, there is
law; if not, in these days of competitive advertising, there is no case for
complaint. Suppose anybody announced "Gladstone Gingerbread,"
"Ayrton Acidulated Drops," or "Salisbury Sugar-candy," where
would be the harm f
We took the Navy Estimates, and had a great row over a vote for
Stores—a trifle of £900,000 or so. But everything asked was granted.
Then a debate on the Alabama Arbitration was raised by MR. G.
SIR 8. NOBTHCOTE defended the Commissioners, and MR. GLADSTONE dwelt ou the advantage of the peace and amity we
are supposed to have secured. MR. C. HKNTINCK told the PRIME MINISTER that he and his colleagues had been overpowered by the
exploded arguments of the late M u. COBDEIT, to which neither the PRIME MINISTER, nor any of his colleagues, nor anybody else
thought it worth while to say a word in reply.
Tuesday. (Eve of S. Derby.)—The first LORD BLACKFOBD, of Wisdome, in Devonshire—by the way, his Lordship's seat is at Ivy
Bridge, a lovely place, and there is an inn there where they sell, or sold, the most beneficial ale, and in the parlour to the right is a mar-
vellous picture representing some local celebrity of the last generation tumbling, with his horse, into some terrific abyss—if we recollect,
neither was hurt, and both were all the better for it— but the picture gives you a mild nightmare. LORD BLACHFORD promoted a Colonial
Church Bill, and then the House rose until the 9th of June.
Dear Toil HUGHES, we do like and admire you so, but what's the good of setting yourself against national feeling, and talking about
the House being spared the humiliation of a special adjournment in compliment to the Derby? You believe that horse-racing does much
mischief to the morals of the people. So do we. But the Derby Day does least mischief of all racing days. It is a great jolly holiday,
and not one person in fifty who go, knows or cares anything about the horses, except as part of the excitement of the day. There is a
vast quantity of nearly harmless pleasure obtained at Epsom by thousands on thousands; and as for the betting rascals and the drunkards,
they really make a very small portion of that English crowd. It's a poor heart that never rejoices, dear T. H.; and though the motive
for rejoicing on a Derby Day may be beneath a philosopher's contempt, we can't all be philosophers, or we should make sharp end and
speedy of a good many tomfooleries less harmless than a wasted day at Epsom.
MB. GfiADSTojTE stated that Government would do all in their power to pay honour to the SHAH OF PERSIA on his visit to this

", Woe to the negligent beggar who shirks hii
Duty to hail the successor of XEBXIB."
Appeal was made to If H. A TETON about the stoppage of traffic in
the streets about Hyde Park, owing to the throng of fashionable
folk, during the season. He gently replied that if proper applica-
tion were made to him by the parochial authorities, he would see
what was to be done. "The stoppages occurred from the happy con-
dition of the inhabitants of the wealthy parish of St. George's,
Hanover Square, who at certain periods of the day enjoyed them-
selves, and afforded great delight to the beholders of their magni-
ficence." This may be so, but Mr. Punch had no great delight
therein on the Derby Day. He came up in his carriage, and did not
encounter one single block until he reached Grosvenor Place. There he
was exposed for at least half an hour to the gaze of the bright eyes of
the beautiful ladies in the balconies, and he became so softened and
bewildered that he could not remember any strong language to hurl
at the bloated aristocracy that was keeping him from his dinner.
The House made a sham of resuming at nine, when there were four
Members present! So we adjourned, and the House of Commons
went away in one cab. Our holidays, thus begun, were to end the
9th of June.
EPISCOPAL ENGLISH.

0 W much it is to be wished that they who
have taken in hand to revise the Autho-
rised Version will so mend as not to
botch and cobble it. Pity it will be if
that pure well of English undefiled have
its chaste waters polluted with slipslop
such as 1 hat, wherein, mostly, our modern
Prelates are wont to compose occasional prayers. In an epistle lately
addressed by three right reverend Bishops to the London Clergy,
recommending certain special missions within their several parishes
for the conversion of the ungodly, you will find these words:—
"We do not think it necessary to lay down special ruin for the conduct of
the mission. There must be much elasticity in tuch an attempt to make it
suit the different characters and needs of various pariihes."
Now, Sirs, this word "elasticity," in the sense of suitableness, is
novel. No doubt it was engendered of the very greatly increased
abundance of India-rubber which has come, within these last few
yean, into use. It is a word much affected by Ministers and Parlia-
ment-men, and also by political leading-article writers. In the
Vestry it were a word especially in place, but as particularly out
of place in the pulpit. It is altogether a secular, mechanical, and
material-scientific word, fit only to be employed in regard to the
management of material and worldly affairs. No poet would use it
in serious verse; neither should a Clergyman in a sermon, charge,
pastoral, or any other communication touching spiritual things,
the rather that it has a significance more or less suggestive of
humbug. An upstart expression foisted into the Text would be
like a patch of new cloth, and that shoddy, sewn, into an old gar-
ment of honest English make. That web is of a woof too precious
to be pieced in with stuff of no more worth than a penny-a-line.
A BIRD IN THE HAND.
A Ballad illustrating an episode in the life of Master Sammy
Simple, related by himself.
Upon a doubtful April day, I walked along the Strand;
Under my arm a book, ana an umbrella in my hand.
And sometimes I these two would change— variety hath charm,
My book I M hold, and carry my umbrella 'ueath my arm.
Thus meditatively I trudged, of mildness an exemplar,
I sought my Temple chambers. Why P Because 1 am a Templar.
And turning, thus, down Essex Street, — its name I 'm free to
mention, —
A sight that touched my tender heart attracted my attention.
A girl who wore the air of one that serves for honest wages
Was being bullied by two roughs, both bearing empty cages,
Betwixt her trembling palms she pressed a 'kerchief, and within it
Lay a poor timid warbler, a canary or a linnet.
One rough exclaimed, "For that there bird to give a bob I 'm
willing."
"Go on with you!" the girl replied. "What! sell it for a
shilling!''
"Come 1 here 's the bob -"
"Get out! - »
"You won't get such another dealer."
"Bill, take the bird !-"
"Leave go, young man, or else I '11 call a peeler!"
anly bosom swelled to see the maiden's situation,
My heaving vest attested my additional pulsation.
And as the Tar, 'longside the foe, his cutlass grasps and boards 'em,
So I my trusty gingham grasped, and— gently walked towards 'em.
Quitting the frightened servant maid, whom they would both have
cheated,
"That bird's worth thirty bob!" they twice, in passing me,
repeated.
"I ain't got sixpence, BILL," says one, " 'aoos I 've not been busy.
We might ha' made two suv'rins, BILL, if we 'd a hextrar tizzy."
"Poor weeping maid!" said I to her (she stopped her boo-hoo-
hooing)
"Confide in me, my friendless girl. What were those rude men
doinjr?"
"They hofferd me," said she, "a bob for this— a pet, Sir, this is—
A buotif ul canary, which its singing worrits Missis."
"Does it indeed!"
"Indeed it do. My Missis, Sir, is hailing,
And finds the Doctor's stuff to cure 'er 'ead-ake hunawailing
Has long as this here bird is hin hits cage, tho' Inn the hairy,
Where it do sing hanjelikal, hall day, do this canary.
"So Missis says, says she, ' I don't arf like to sell the beauty;
Bat sell it, JANE,'— that's me, — 'you must;' and so I does my duty.
And, seein' men with cages there, which looks like birds a buying,
I hoffered it to them— the cheats !— and then you found me crying.
"She'll be so hangry, Missis will "— (her eyes again were filling) —
"'Cos h'I'm so long away."
"I '11 buy the bird. How much P"
"Three shilling."
I 'd heard 'twas worth fall thirty, so, that conscience might acquit
me,
I said, "Nay, nay, not three, my child; I'll give you five —
permit me."
And then I bought a cage from those two rogues, still near us
hoverin',
I got it for five shillings more, and that made half a soverin';
And then I took it to my rooms, just over a Queen's Counsel,
I gave it water, bought some seed, some chickweed, and some
groun'sel.
For days and days it hopped about, in a perpetual flutter,
But not a single songster's note did that Canary utter;
And— most remarkable— it grew less yellow, daily duller,
Till, after many baths, it turned to quite another colour!
To think chicanery like this should thrive! it chills my marrow I
I washed it carefully with soap,— it teas a painted Sparrow .'
******
To think that honest-looking Maids should thus combine to sell you!
But— if I 'm taken in again, I 'm - sure to write and tell you.

A HINT TO MR. GLADSTONE.
MR. GLADSTONE, in his excellent speech at the Literary Fond
dinner the other day, was eloquent both on the admirable distribu-
tion made by the Committee of the Society of the means for the
relief of literary need with which it is entrusted, and on the dis-
creditable narrowness of those means. We venture to suggest to
him a plan, which, without increasing the national burdens, will
enable him, at once, to increase those means, and to transfer a task
both burdensome to himself, and so ill-performed that every attempt
at performance raises a storm of angry dissatisfaction, to an agency
which, by his own admission, not only can do, but does the work to
perfection. For this purpose he has only to hand over to the Literary
Fund that part of the £1200 a-year Pension-fund which is assigned
to literary persons, and ask the Committee of the L. F. to distribute
it, as, by his own acknowledgment, the best public almoners in cases
of literary distress.
Such a transfer will be twice blessed, as all mercy should be,
according to SHAKSPEARB; it will bless him that gives no less than
him, or her, who takes, and it will cost nothing to the Treasury—a
low consideration, perhaps, but one, for that reason, all the more
likely to be favourably viewed by the present Treasury authorities.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
After » I'isit to the Jubilee Singers and La Fills de Madame Angot, he reports to the Editor.

IB,.—Your Represent-
ative felt some con-
siderable curiosity
concerning the Jubilee
Singers, and could not
rest until he had been
an ear-witness of the
musical proceedings
of these very peculiar
people. I presented
myself with a ticket,
I mean that, with a
ticket in my hand, I
presented myself at
the door of Hanover
Square Rooms, on
Saturday afternoon,
five minutes after
three. The Hanover Square Rooms, by day-
light, exercise upon me an effect the reverse
of exhilarating. All smiles abandon I on
entering therein.
So when I [heard that the Jubilees were going to sing at the Hanover Square Rooms, I
trembled for {their prospects. I am delighted to say I was, for once, quite wrong. The
Jubilees are just the people to delight an afternoon audience in the Hanover Square Rooms,
whichjwere crowded in every part, before the Jubilee Singers, behind the Jubilee Singers
(where some of the elderly ladies who sighed a good deal and breathed hard on the backs
of the Jubilees, were evidently rather disturbing to the Christian temper of the Singers),
round 'about the Jubilee Singers, above them, and below them. In fact, had you wanted
to stick a pin in anywhere, and I should have liked to have done it to some selfish
crowding persons, you would have had plenty of .soft material at hand, but very little space
for the .vicious play of the elbow.
The entertainment given by these Jubilee Singers is a sort of revivalist chanting toned down
to suit the aristocratic and respectable precincts of the Hanover Square Rooms. I recognised
a few of their hymn tunes as what have been known, in this country, under the name of
Popular Negro Melodies, only that the Jnbes take them slowly and solemnly, with the altera-
tion of some notes here and there, and have wedded them to their conventional conventicle
hymn-words. The ,1 tines are Scripturally hard on "Ole Pharo," and "Ole Satan," and
occasionally express their unqualified joy at beholding " Ole Dan'l sittin' up dar,"—which
elevated position, judging by the context, seems to mean a distinguished seat in a "great
camp-meeting," in Paradise. The Lawgiver of the Children of Israel is familiarly exhorted
to Come along, Moses I" and the Jubes are never tired of allusions to crossing "de riber
Jordan," and landing safely on "de oder side," which being reached, they sing out in
jubilation " 0, wasn't dat a wide riber?"
Some of their moat simple melodies, and most simple words, touch a true chord of human
sympathy, and for some moments, the hearts of Octoroon, Quadroon, Thorough Black, and
Engliah'jWhite, vibrate in unison. The entertainment was pleasantly relieved by a lanky
American Gentleman, the Entrepreneur, I suppose, to the JUDOS, who stalked out in front of
the platform suddenly, as if the action were entirely unpremeditated, and, holding a book
aloft, addressed the audience with great earnestness. He said, with, a strong American twang,
"Ladies and Gentlemen, this book"—here he paused in order to get the entire attention of
the audience concentrated on the article in question, in which attempt he at once succeeded,
most persons present being, probably, under the impression that the proceedings were to be
varied by a little extempore conjuring—" this book, that I hold in my hand,"—he was very
emphatic on this point, why I could not clearly make out, unless he was usually accustomed
to stand on his head and hold books with his toes—"this book contains the life and
history "—I won't answer for the words verbatim, but this was their purport—" of the Jubilee
Singers, as nar-rated by themselves." It occurred to Your Representative how much he
would like at any time to have such an opportunity for making the world acquainted with
his own'personal biography. "There are portraits of each of them," continued the lanky
gentleman lowering his book and inspecting it himself as if for the first time in his life—
"they're not very good ones," he added, so that no one should be induced to purchase by
false pretence,—" but," he went on, holding up the book once more, so as to show a frontis-
piece representing: some architectural design, "here is a picture of Fisk University, the
Jubilee Hall, to the funds of which place the exertions of these Singers will contribute. The
book is only one dollar," four shillings was its price—" and anyone buying it will know
that they're helping a good work." The "good work" was not intended to describe the
book, but the object of the Jubilee Singers.
So I came away from Hanover Square
Rooms, pleased and edified by the Jubes,
and when I had assumed the toga uthite-
tielig of evening life, I invited myself to
dine at VERREY'S. On the strike of eight
I sang out with Tom Tug, in The Water-
man—
"Then farewell my trim-built YERRBY!"
and betook myself to hear La FiUe de
Madame Angot at the St. James's. "Gen-
tlemen," some amusing singer used to say
to his laughing audience in the ancient
Cider Cellar days, "this is not a comic
song." La Pillede Madame Angot is called
an Opera Comique in Three Acts, and 'tis
written by three_ authors collaborating.
Hence probably its length. The music,
by CHARLES LECOCQ, is occasionally very
taking, but the three authors have over-
weighted the unfortunate composer, who
comes out now and then with a really good
thing, but not until you've been pretty
well bored by the libretto. It should be
compressed into two Acts, or the three
should be considerably shortened.
MADAME DEI.OHME, as Amaranthe, gave
her song and its jovial refrain, descriptive
of the great Madame Angot, capitally. It
was deservedly encored, as was also the
ChcEur det Conjurh in the Second Act.
MLI.K. JEANKE DALBERT, as Mile. Lange,
brought out all the humour (the authors
are to blame for not having made this
situation twice as strong, and, by conse-
quence, doubly as funny as it is at present)
of the Tournez Tournez"aolo and chorus,
where—but this must be seen to be appre-
ciated. It is well got up, the chorus being
admirable throughout, and the costumes
are very effective.
Whether with Bouffes at the Gaiety, the
Strand, and the Opera Comique, and two
Italian Operas, all going on simultaneously,
the more the merrier will prove the rule, is
what I am not called upon to determine as
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
P.S. In answer to an advertisement that
caught my foot and my eye on the pave-
ment, I beg to say that I have not yet seen
Killjoy, the sly Dog of the Adelphi, but I
will. Also that I failed in an attempt to
represent my chief at About Town, at the
Court, where, however, I saw the Happy
Land for the second time, and thought it
capital up to the end of the first twenty-
five minutes, when it ought to finish; and
that my absence was conspicuous among
those who went to see The New Magdalen.
I shall wait till she is The Old Magdalen.
Adieu. Adieu. I am aweary, aweary.

COMMON CRIES.
DURING the stormy debate in the French
National Assembly, which resulted in caus-
ing the resignation of M. THIBRS, of course,
we were duly told by telegram that :—
"Immense agitation prevailed throughout the
sitting, and an excited crowd has aMembled in the
Hue dea Keaervoirj."
With the sole difference of some other
street than the Rue des Reservoirs, how
often have you read all this before, and will
again, if you live. Inevitably the crowd
in waiting outside the Chamber raised
shouts of r' Vive la JMpublique.'" What
will be their next cry? "Vive la Mo-
narchie Conititutionelle," or " Vive VEm-
pire?" or is it even possible that the next,
or after the next not very distant utterance
of their most sweet voices, will be " Vive
leRoit"

PUNCH'S DERBY PROPHECY.
THESE now! That comes of relying on somebody else, instead of doing
one's work oneself. For yours and yean Mr. Punch has been his own Derby
Prophet, and has, of course, never once been wrong. This year, just for a
change, he sends to Assyria for a Prophecy, and obtains one. A beautiful one,
no doubt, and one which he rendered into English undented, which he hopes
will be studied by certain Revisers, in the Jerusalem Chamber. But, a> he
slated, two lines were entirely illegible. He telegraphed to MR. GEORGE
SMITH, to send him a fresh copy, but the telegraph porter's uncle's aunt's
cousin had been beheaded that morning, and the family had held such re-
joicings that the inebriated messenger went to Moselle instead of Mosul.
However, Ma. SMITH got the message at last, and most kindly and promptly
sent us the missing lines—too late, alas, for insertion in our Number, but we
gave away copies to all persons who applied for them on Me Wednesday, at
85, Fleet Street. We print them now merely to show that we lost no chance
of completing the vaticination. There came, after the lines—
"Let him upraise his cry,
And put his fine gold upon the horse
WTuae name it from a northern city ofratti,
So i/iall he be at I he owner it named."
We have frankly explained the accident, but as we were enabled to place
all the best horses among " the more potent striven," and to put Gang For-
ward and Kaiser together, and to bring Ihncuster out as no other Prophet
has done, and to signalise Chandos, who was fourth, as a " grand oss," we gave
about six times as much real information as any contemporary. But we have
usually selected a Winner, and our nomination has always been right. We
regret that it was not absolutely thus this time, but the astronomer of King
Belligofuster the Uncompromising showed wonderful instinct. Another year,
however, we read the Stars for ourselves.
CRT OF COLUBBS' UNIONS.—A fair day's work for a fair week's

OUR CULINARY PROSPECTS.
IF Cooking be not worthy to be ranked with the Fine Arts, it may
certainly be classed among the elegant professions: at least we
judge so by the tone adopted by its followers, when they proclaim
themselves at liberty to accept a vacant place. Here is a recent
specimen of the grandiloquence employed:—
"As a Professed Cook and Housekeeper, in a Nobleman's family. Salary
£50."
Obviously, cooking mast be viewed as a profession, since its prac-
titioners assume the title of Professed Cooks; and surely nobody
would dream of regarding them as servants, seeing that they now
no longer work for vulgar wages, but politely claim a salary to
reward them for their toil. Obviously, moreover, Cooks feel pride
in their profession, or they would hardly stipulate that the family
must be a noble one where they will condescend to take a situation.
To other professional persons such exolnsiveuess is denied: and
we therefore should regard with due humility the social precedence
of Cooks. A Lawyer hardly can expect to pick his clients from the
Peerage, nor could a Doctor hope for large advantage to his practice
by announcing that in future he intended to prescribe for noblemen
alone. Perhaps we soon may hear of Cooks, on the day before a
dinner-party, demanding information about the guests invited, and
declining to serve entrees for those without a title, or handle to
their names. Or we may live to read of Kitohenmaids becoming so
particular about the social rank of the ladies who engage them, that
they will commonly insist, as a postscript to advertisements, "N.B.
—Nobody beneath a Duchess need apply."
Another Protector.
TIJK rallying cry of the new French President is "Dieu et
I'Armfe." Is it quite original P At least a similar sentiment was
embodied in the exhortation addressed by the Chief of another
Commonwealth to the1 troops, whom he advised to put their trust in
providential assistance, and at the same time to take the necessary
care of their powder.

And befools the green in the bumpkin's eye;
When thy flesh and blood on the horseoourse rave,
And around thee the few are serene and grave,

ROGERS'S NEW PLEASURE OF MEMORY.
TIIKRF, is nothing like a thankful spirit. So precious
is it, that it is not wise, perhaps, to be too curious in
analysing the sources of it, any more than it is likely to
conduce to our comfort, sometimes, to analyse those of
the water we drink. But of all the thankful men we
have known, PBOFESSOB THOBOLD RUCKUS, of Oxford,
has shown the most ingenuity in discovering a reason
for thankfulness, when at a meeting of the Oxford
Council of Convocation, the other day, to decide for or
against SIB <jII.HKKT SCOTT'S designs for the new Schools,
he said, "he was thankful he understood nothing of
Art."
We had thought MB. ATBTON the only man who had
discovered that particular motive for thankfulness. But
if PBOFESSOB ROOEKS be equally thankful for all he
understands nothing of, what a great deal he must have
to be thankful for 1
Mr. Punch has heard of "graces" offered to the
Senate of Cambridge, if not to the Convocation of Oxford.
He would respectfully suggest to the former learned
body that PBOFESSOR ROGEBS should be admitted, per
saltum, to an ml eundem Mastership of Arts at the sister
University, in order that he may offer to the Senate this,
which we will take leave to call the new Rogers' Grace—
"a grace" indeed "beyond the reach of Art"—"For
what we hare not received, may we be truly thankful."

IN THE NAME OF PEACE AND ITS PfiOFIT.
™ M. DX [. KSSK PS publishes the communications which have passed
between himself and GENEBAL IGNATIEFF, representative of the
Russian Government at Constantinople, on the subject of his grand
proposal for a railway line to connect the barbarous regions of
Central Asia (which Russia is now engaged in civilising) with
Russia on the one side and British India on the other—an iron
highway, in short—as Russian highways ought to be—between
St. Petersburg and Pcshawur. M. UK LESSEPS and GENEBAL IUNA-
TIEFF both express their hope and trust that England will see the
enormous interest she has in promoting this magnificent undertaking,
in the interests at once of commerce and civilisation—not, as a shal-
low view might lead one to believe, of Russian conquest in Central
Asia, and as a Russian short-cut to British India.
When this noble, if costly, enterprise is carried out, England
will have only to cede Gibraltar to the rising Republic of Spain,
Aden to the SULTAN OF MUSCAT, Singapore to the EMPEROR OF
CHINA or any Malay potentate who may like to take it, and make a
few other acts of becoming, though tardy, restitution, and then to
take shares, extensively, in M. DE LESSEPS crowning project—still in
his portfolio—for converting the " silver streak " of the Channel into
dry land, as he has already transformed the sand of the Egyptian
desert into sea, to feel that she has done an instalment, at least, of
what she is bound to do for the promotion of international frater-
nity, and the advancement of commerce and civilisation, all over
the world, with the same noble disregard to her own narrow and
selfish interests as an empire, which has been shown on all occasions
by her Continental neighbours, and, above all, by Russia, whose
representative at the Ottoman Porte so disinterestedly welcomes, and
promises to recommend to his Government, this last great and bene-
volent project of M. DE LESSEPS,
Let Mr. Punch earnestly hope—if he cannot quite go eonfidently
anticipate—that Great Britain will seem to see it; that all this will
sooner or later be effected; and that Great Britain'will live happy
ever after, crippled here and there, it may be, but with the consoling
consciousness that she has substituted for the unsociable barriers of
severing seas and mountains, barbarous Khanates and inhospitable
deserts, the grander defences of cosmopolitan goodwill and philan-
thropic fraternity I Heaven speed the time! May the shadow of
Russia, the moving spirit of this mighty change, never be less!
And may LESSEPS be handed up to Prosperity, and down to Pos-
terity, as the realiser of this grand scheme of Peace, and its Prophet—
with the " fi" as well as the " phe " thereunto belonging.
TEETOTAL TATTLE.
"DON'T be a fool!" was the reply of a Professor of Finance to a
person who asked him whether prosperity of the liquor trade was
not always accompanied by tightness in the money-market.
The announcement of the fact that no less than £28,000,000 of the
national income is derived from the duty on " intoxicating liquors,"
has suggested a new synonym for the state which results from the
abuse of those generous beverages. As the Member for a Northern
Constituency and a representative of rational people were conversing
in a street contiguous to the House of Commons, a working-man
approached, them, walking zigzag, and inquired the way to West-
minster Bridge. "Straight as you can go," answered the more
practical Member, and, turning to his companion, added, "That
fellow, you see, SIB WILFBID, has been contributing to the Revenue."

POPE AND NO PRETENDER.
LONG live His Holiness to sit in PETER'S chair,
So-called, that is, at Rome, if PETER ne'er was there.
But, if he be a link, indeed, of PETBB'S chain,
To rule as PETER ruled still on may Pius reign.
Because there is no doubt at least of this one thing;
Whate'er ST. PETER was, he was no temporal King.
And, Pius from the load of temporal kingship free,
Pius to PETER is therein as P. to P.
Pius has, first of Popes, the years of PETEB seen;
Reduced to PETBB'S realm his own domain has been.
And Italy will be of nations all the fool
If ever Pope again bear more than PKTKR'S rule.
Pros was made a King, and for a King was owned;
A kingdom still can claim, although by force dethroned.
But Cardinals have since to subjects been cut down.
The law that made him King can no successor crown.
"When into Conclave next their Eminences go,
Thus much must Italy not fail to let them know :—
The Vatican remains the POPE'S allotted home;
But held beneath her King, thenceforth sole King in Rome.
The Latest Invention.
THE arrival of Summer cannot be much longer delayed. We

A CONTRIBUTION TO THE TICHBORNE TRIAL.
THE LOHD CHIEF JUSTICE expressed the difficulty he
felt in understanding how a female character could
possibly be turned into a male one in such pieces as were
produced at Stonyhurst. SIB ALEXANDER is, probably,
well acquainted with the "Triumviretta" entitled Cox
and Sox, for which MB. ARTHUR SULLIYAN composed
some of Lis very best music of the lighter sort. In Sox
and Cox, the original farce, the third character was the
immortal Mn. Bouncer; but in Cox and Box, the
opera bouffe, Mrs. Bouncer, for reasons best known to
the librettist, becomes Sergeant Bouncer, and the muta-
tion was most satisfactory, as no doubt the LORD CHIEF
JUSTICE, who is a judge of music, can testify. If his
•Lordship cannot, but requires further explanation, it is
at hand from
A SKILLED WITNESS.
Survival in Spain.
THE Carlists have not yet triumphed over Spanish
liberty. But one day last week a telegram from Madrid,
relative to a Cabinet Council and the Cortes, announced
that:—
"The latter body will be opened on Sunday."
It may reassure the minds of some readers to inform
them that the Representative Government in Spain is
not yet defunct.
THE NEXT "DEMONSTRATION."
THE Isthmian Games were of a character distinctly Pagan. There
are some who account the great annual horse-race at Epsom, called
after them by our late genial and jolly Premier, little better. But
what would those good people say of the French Derby, run on a
Sunday?
"We, however, are not as other nations "are, nor even as that
France. "We do not desecrate the Sunday with horse-racing. No;
amongst us that day is happily devoted to far other contests—by the
Ministers of all denominations.
A competition, indeed, between our various Preachers is to come
off this very next Sunday. But this will not be one of a distinctly
controversial character, in which the Preachers will expressly con-
tend for proselytes. On Sunday next, June 15, our different Divines
will all agree in devoting their eloquence to the advocacy of charity,
as represented by our public Hospitals. Instead of discourses chiefly
consisting in the assertion of opinions as facts, the extremest of
dogmatists even will address themselves in the main to the inculca-
tion of duties which nobody can deny.
Of course, all who enjoy the unspeakable blessing of a sure and
certain income, more than sufficient for all their wants, are prepared
to contribute largely out of their superabundance to the Offertory-
bag, plate, or poor-box. But unless they rent pews, wherein seats
will be reserved for them, they will have to go to Church or
Chapel early next Sunday. Or else they will be crowded out; for
every Church and every Chapel is sure to be crammed with the
working classes. They, of all sorts and conditions of men, and
women, are those whom Hospitals principally concern. They are
the people who, as a body, enjoythe chief benefit, such enjoyment
as it is, of those institutions. The cause of the Hospitals is simply
their own. They have lately signalised their capacity for self-help
by mutual association in Trades Unions, and combination in strikes
for higher wages, and in menacing demonstration against the Law,
which in some degree regulates strikes. By the high wages which
they have thus obtained through co-operation, they have been
enabled to rejoice in the consumption of good things so greatly as to
have very much raised the price of nearly all of them. Almost
untouched by any other than voluntary taxation, they contribute,
of their own accord, the greater part of £28,000,000 yearly to the
revenue by their spontaneous liberality in solacing themselves with
"intoxicating," but exciseable, fluids. None can better afford
than they to support institutions that operate to their own especial
advantage, all the rather that, if they will live up to their incomes
while their work lasts, there ia no place for them out the Hospital,
except the Workhonse, when both wages and health fail. To bestow
charity not only on their fellow-man, but their fellow-workmen,
and very likely also on their own individual selves, the generous,
yet prudent working-men, will, of course, contribute not their
mites, but their sovereigns, and bank-notes. On Sunday next,
Hospital Sunday, the working classes may be expected to rush in
their thousands to their various places of worship, prepared to devote
as much as they can possibly spare from necessary expenses to the
Hospital funds. They might, however, do better than rushing
along the streets pell-mell and higgledy-piggledy. Let them march
in marshalled and orderly processions to their several temples, under
the guidances of leaders on horseback, and beneath flying banners
announcing appropriate sentiments, and especially the determination
to be independent of Capital in respect of self-assistance. Thus
they will unite in a demonstration which we should all admire, one
entirely suitable to the day of the week, and particularly appropriate
to Hospital Sunday.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

RBAT Lilliputs affairs again sum-
moned its Senators on Thursday,
June 5.—The Hurgoes did not
meet, taking prolonged Whit-
suntide holiday. Bat the Clinabs
re-assembled at the call of their
WIMGUL, and there was a goodly
array on both the Tramecsan
and Slamecsan benches.
How, Madam? Are you dis-
posed to think of preparing to
stare? Ton cannot be so rude. Doth it occnr to you that your Punch hath partaken too
freely of the wine-cup? Far be that thought from you. Or are you inclined to quote our
dear old friend and contributor G. A. A'BECKETT, and say—
"You surely do forget yourself, my son,
And of your ' mother' come to make vile fun ?''
Dismiss the idea. We would instruct you, but in so delightful a fashion that you shall
rather like being instructed than not. Know that in the last century, when the Reporters'
Gallery was not, Parliamentary speeches were furtively given to the reader, but the names of
the orators had to be disguised. In the Gentleman's Magazine—volumes for 1739, '40, and
'II lie before us—you shall read, if you will, the senatorial talk of the time, but yon must
think of your Gulliver, and you must be apt at anagram, if you would detect the Speakers'
names, and the places or things spoken of. Punch will give you a specimen of such reporting,
(borrowing the old nomenclature when it will serve,) and if it bores you, no matter. In talk-
ing to a Lady 'tis better to create any sensation in her mind than none at all, as those who
have loved know well. [Ah, BELINDA! (Sighs deeply). That was a Bellowser, as our friend,
WILKIB COLLINS, says.] But let us to business, even as went the faithful Clinabs to-day.
The Urgol Sadnud took his seat for Michrond, in the room of the present Hurgo
Daltnez.
In reply to the Hurgokn Oatehey, who asked about the lerne Census, the Glum-glum
Toninghart said that a good deal was done, and all would be ready in 187-1.
In reply to the Urgol Skul, the Urgol Cursetfoe said that the Deck-loading question was
to be considered by the Royal Commission.
The Senate then went into Committee on the Juries Bill. The Urg. JDyrah wished to
exempt Masters of Public Schools, Professors, and College Tutors, from service on juries.
The First Snilpal Adviser of the Government opposed this, but was beaten by 70 to 55, so
a Master need not dismiss his class to football, that he may throw away his Horace and go
and sit to decide whether SNORKS cheated I JIT TONS more than an honest tradesman has a
right to do.
The Urg. Lempam moved to exempt Officers of the Houses of Hargoes and Clinabs, and
this was agreed to, the exemption being only, however, during the Session.
The Urg. Stew.would exempt Town Councillors, Justices of the Peace, and others.
The First Snilpal Adviser admitted that the gentlemen referred to were, as a rule, f ally
occupied, but if they were to exempt all who were fully occupied they would hav to fall
back on those whom he from his soul abominated—"professional" jurors, men of loose and
inaccurate minds, hangers on to Society, and in every way the least qualified for serving on
juries. The proposal was rejected by 126 to 12. Hurgokt Juan's language will bitterly
offend a lot of fussy and officious prigs, who love to see themselves in a jury-box, and hear
themselves buttered up by the barristers.
Lac. Tollbarlet wished to exempt Veterinary Surgeons, and, after some debate, this was
agreed to. Punch congratulates the Vets, some of whom are the best fellows he knows,
Madam, men who combine a genuine and genial love of the horse with knowledge of his
wants and ways. Punch rejoices that they are not to be put into a "tight" box.
The Urg. Wylldin would exempt Rail-
way Managers. This was refused, Mr.
Punch cannot tell why. A Manager had
better be at his post, providing against
accidents, than sitting in a box to reduce
damages asked by an injured passenger.
The Urg. Fawdcror would exempt the
Governor and Deputy Governor of the
Nabk. ""
The Urg. Norven Truhocar (Odfrox)
made a humorous suggestion. He would
vote for the exemption, but it should not
apply to the days which were Nabk holi-
days. This riled the Urg. Fawdcror, who
said the jest was beneath the speaker. The
Senate laughed, however: and the Senator
for Mildendo should not be cross, especially
as his Motion was agreed to.
Other proposals were made and negatived,
and then the Ealdarman Rancewel pro-
posed to exempt all the Ealdermen of
Mildendo.
To this responded the acute and able
Hinrtc Jacomo (we follow the G. M., but
could have made a much better anagram
about the Senator for Notaunt), who said,
"and wisely was it said," that
"There were good aldermen and bad aldermen.
(Laughter.) The good aldermen got into the
House of Commons, and were exempt, and as for
the bad aldermen, it would be a great advantage
that they should sit on juries, and thus acquire
a little knowledge of jurisprudence. (Laughter.)
The aix aldermen who were in the House of Com-
mons might very well take the duties of such of
their colleagues as were compelled to serve on
juries."
This did convince, and the Amendment
was rejected by 81 to 17.
The Urg. O. Rangom would exclude all
persons who could not speak Lilliputian.
This suggestion he meant chiefly for the
benefit of Sawel, but a Senator named
Wimguls declared that great numbers of
Shetol, who could not speak that language,
were capital jurymen, and the First Snilpil
Adviser said that such an exemption would
be to abolish trial by jury altogether in
Sawel. So the idea was given up.
The Urg. R. Loiofer would exempt all
gentlemen of 60, instead of beginning ex-
emption at 70. Bat it appears that any
one who has good reason to claim it at 65
may. do so, and this proposal was negatived.
We think that if a gentleman even of 70 ia
able and willing to serve, he might well do
so. For
1 The Soul's dark cottage, battered and decayed,
Lets in new light thro' chinks that Time hath
made."
Pretty lines, Madam. Know whose they
are? Our own? Hookey-Walker. They
are dear EDMUND WALLER'S, Madam,
SACHARISSA'S lover.
More proposals of exemption (for it is
delightful to see how eager the true Lilli-
putian is to escape being made part of the
Palladium of Lilliput's Liberty), but they
were disposed of, and we came to the clause
which interferes for the improvement of
Mildendo Juries. The City fought hard
against such profanity, but the Urg. Jacomo
told the Senators that the commercial Juries
jot worse and worse every year, and that
the lists were selected from the worst
citizens. The City made more row, but the
clause was retained by 97 to 19.
On. the clause for providing for the pay-
ment of expenses out of the Poor Rates,
resistance was made by the Urg. Naigmac,
and a somewhat earnest debate ensued,
which brought up the great orator,
The Urg. Wimgul Staneglod, who treated
ihe motion as one of censure on the Govern-
ment for not taking a certain view of local

taxation. He protested vigorously against a coarse which would
cripple a most valuable Bill.
The Urg. Reviebou warned the Senate against a snap division.
In effect, Madam, things were looking a little ominous, and Govern-
ment has had some awkward facers lately.
The Urg. Retrob Woel had no objection to fight the matter, but
a fair notice ought to be given.
Finally, progress was reported, that is, matters came to a dead
stop.
An lerne Registration Bill was passed.
No foreign questions were raised. No one had anything to say
of the new Chief of the State of Bkfuicu, of the Exhibit ion at
Vinena, of the progress of the Pthaw in Partishy, or of the Carlist
war in Iberia. Nor had the Urg. Yellawh anything to observe
against Mutahm, or in favour of Phat Tonor.
There! dear Madam. Will that do? Out of such reports as
that your respected great-grandmother had to pick her political
knowledge. „. Be thankful that you live in days when not only is
Parliamentary talk given with the utmost freedom, but when you,
dear, have a Punch by your side to supply you with its Essence
only.
Friday.—MR. BETJCE, referring to the case of the sixteen viragos
of Chipping-Norton, who were sent to gaol by two Parsons for
intimidating a brace of valiant labourers, declared that the punish-
ment WM excessive, and that the LOUD CHANCELLOR meant to call
on the Magistrates for explanation. MR. GLADSTONE afterwards
intimated, darkly, yet plainly enough, that he thought the fewer
Clergymen put on the bench the better.
The SHAH was to be received, said MB. GOSCHBN, by a consider-
able gathering of Iron-Clade, but there was to be no naval review.
Very well, bnt let 'em all roar their very loudest—don't spare
powder on that day.
Debate on Cavalry Horses. We have 7481, and MR. CABDTVELL
says that nothing can be finer than our men and their steeds.
The rest of the night was given to debate on the Law of Masters
and Servants, MB. V. HAHCOUBT attacking it, and MB. BBTJCE
defending. For the present the House upholds the old Scotch
doctrine—
"If he have na gold to fine,
He has ahiiA to pine."

IT is not often that Mr. Punch favours the world with the con-

ow, on Whit Mon-
day, it being a
Bank Holiday,
and the weather
permitting ex-
cursions, the om-
nibuses, rail-
ways, and steam-
boats were very
crowded, and so
were all the
usual places of popular resort,
wherein, apart from the demon-
strators in Hyde Park, the People
assembled in their thousands. The
day was dry, but so, the United
Kingdom Allies must grieve to
think, were not the People. That,
on the other hand, the People in
general, or any considerable per-centage of them, were wet, in the
sense in which that epithet is wont to be applied to an unworthy mem-
ber of the Society of Friends, it would be libellous to say. Compara-
tively few appeared to be what is vulgarly, though euphemistically,
called "tight" and " screwed." Still they had, as many of them as
were not Teetotallers, their whack, as the Mobility say, or, at least,
were in a position to have it if they chose. There's the respect which
must sadden the United Kingdom Allies; 'tis enough to make them
all, as our youth phrase it, blub, with SIR WILFRID LAWSON at the
head of them, chief mourner. They have no doubt wept rivers to
think how the People's enjoyment of a holiday on Whit-Monday
must have been impaired by the circumstance that the inns, taverns,
and restaurants remained open all day, even between the hours of
three and six in the afternoon; the very time within which the
majority of persons put for the day want to dine 1
Abandoned to their own self-guidance with regard to their dinner-
hour, and not only that, but being also at liberty to accompany
their meals with indulgence in intoxicating fluids, the People were,
of course, deprived of the pleasure, which on Sundays and other
ecclesiastical holidays they are now obliged to experience, of exer-
cising the virtue of patience, which is its own reward, in contentedly
submitting to the sweet yoke of the paternal Licensing Act.
Perhaps it will be suggested that they had probably had enough of
it the day before: but total abstinence is not, like beer, one of
those good things (if beer can be called a good thing) of which you
can have too much. To render the Bank Holiday equally enjoyable
with the Sunday, it is obviously necessary that all the taverns and
refreshment-rooms should, on every such day of recreation, as well
as the weekly one, be shut up at least during the whole of the after-
noon, so that, if the People wish to dine betwixt the third hour and
the sixth, they may be able to do so if they stay at home, and not
otherwise. Then the pure pleasure of sight-seeing and visiting
remarkable places will no longer be alloyed with any exhilaration
derived from the fermented and stimulant beverages at the command
of all travellers and others who are permitted to take their ease in
their Inn. And, when all other holidays shall, in regard to restric-
tions of personal liberty, have been put on the same footing as
Sunday, let those who like call the Licensing Act a paternal enact-
ment; they will, at any rate, be unable any longer to denounce it as
a piece of Sabbatarian legislation.

ONCE more Grief's hard bat not unkindly hand,
Closer knits England and her ruling race:
Tis no feigned sympathy that, through the land,
Throws this dark shadow on BRITANNIA'S face.
As she was widow with her widowed QUEEN,
And watching wife by her sick Prince's bed,
So now her mother's tears, of truest teen.
With this bereaved young mother will be shed.
England lives with her that dire moment's space,
That fall from height of joy to depth of ill;
Yearns with her o'er the death-pale little face,
But now so full of life, and now so still!
Sad Princess, if 'tis comfort in thy woe,
That every English mother shares therein,
To hold thee up, under this crushing blow,
Such strength thou from a nation's love may'st win.
Let Faction's jaundiced eyes and poisoned lips
See and say what they will, this still is true,
Here rules a Royal Race, whose grief's eclipse
Darkens our joy, whose joy claims ours as due.
Nor slavish is this sense of common life
Shared by the nation and its Royal Line:
No artificial fruit of civil strife,
In whose hot blasts such growths but peak and pine:
Bat the free fruitage of that seed of trust
In law-ruled Prince by law-ruled People sown:
Wliuso roots allow no space for lever-thrust
Of Demagogic wedge 'twixt folk and Throne.
"What race, whose children are so proud to spe&k
Their mother-country's name, as this of ours?
Where Faction, free as air, is yet so weak:
Where silent Sense loud Folly so o'erpowers.
And if this land, while still of all the lands
The closest to its Throne in griefs and joys,
To ordered liberty still stauncnest stands,
And most renews, because it least destroys,
Of slowly ripened seeds all this is fruit,
And while those seeds live, fair their fruit will be:
Then let our loyal love, of comfort root,
Ou thy child's grave bloom in pale flowers for thee.
A BOON AND A BLOW.

to overworked bank-clerks except at the cost of impeding business

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
He visits the School of Cookery, at the International; is edified, and
reports. He also adds a P.S. about the Opera Comique.
ONOTTR'D SIB, — Music, the
Drama, Art, .Kit he tics
generally, may be treated
lightly, nay, flippantly.
But Cookery is a serious
and solemn thing. I avoid
levity, and state at once
that I visited the School of
Cookery at Kensington.
Circumstances over which,
etc., made me rather late.
I rushed into the Inter-
national, sought out the
Cookery Room, found it,
was told there was only
standing room, was admit-
ted, seated myself on a
rail, like the little water-
wagtail in the old nursery
rhyme, and, taking off my
hat, was at once all ears.
(Of course I write as Your
Representative.)
The Lecture is given
in the trimmest - looking
kitchen you ever saw out
of a toy-shop. And, Sir,
the trimmest-looking maids,
to suit the place, in the
neatest possible uniform; the best looking one being (like those
selected for the first line of the ballet) in front. Your Repre-
sentative was delighted; he was seeing "how it's done." There
were the stewpans. and the saucepans, and all the other pans,
and the fires, and the cooks. There were the meats, and the vege-
tables and the breadcrumbs, and high up in a rostrum was the
intelligent Lecturer, looking uncommonly like an American skipper
(I have never, to my recoHeotion, seen an American skipper, but
can imagine as well as anyone), with kitchen-knives, skewers, and
other weapons of his peaceful campaigns hanging up on the wall
behind him.
The Cooks cooked while the Lecturer lectured. They seemed to
me to be (at first) entirely independent of the Lecturer, but this I
attribute to my having been so late, and having, as it were, missed
the first piece of beef.
The Lecturer exhibited a pea-sausage, which he said had "been
through the War," and he further informed us that when the German
soldier could do nothing else, he fell back on his pea-sausage. It
was a dull audience, and didn't take any of the Lecturer's jokes;
but he evidently was able to gauge his audience, for finding his
humorous touches unappreciated, he changed the whole tone of the
discourse, which, when I entered, was inclining towards fun, into a
serious essay on our duty towards our neighbour, and the marvellous
designs of Providence as exemplified in onions and vegetable soups.
All this was what they call in magazines "padding," and was
uncommonly like the "patter" with which a skilful conjuror
engages the attention of the audience while some mechanical change
is taking place in an orange-tree, or his assistant is struggling out
of a drawer in a table. It is unfair to entice us in to hear a lecture
on cooking, and then to make us-listen to a very commonplace
sermon. If this is to be the plan, let the Lecturer and the A HCII -
BISHOP OF CANTERBURY take turn and turn about in the rostrum:
one down t'other come on—but let each stick to his text.
The Lecturer drew a comparison between the wasteful cooking of
an English artisan's wife and that of a German soldier: very much,
of course, and most justly in favour of the latter. I think he also
mentioned a French peasant's cookery: a Breton peasant thrives,
where a Devonshire clodhopper would starve.
The crowd (and the room was crowded) consisted mainly of
ladies.
The Lecturer made all his points tell with admirable effect. When
he found his padding getting a trifle wearisome, even to such an
audience, he suddenly brightened up and said, "Now the Onion!"
Whereupon the excitement was as great as when the horses come
round Tattenham Corner. Your Representative was no proof against
the one touch of Nature which makes the whole world kin, and he,
like the rest, scrooged and elbowed and leant forward to see the
Onion in the cook's hand. I believe the pervading idea was that
nothing was real, that there was some deception somewhere, and
that now, or never, we should detect it. Ne, there was no doubt
about it (at least I think not), it was a real Onion; at all events not
a bit like what you M see, under similar conditions, in a Pantomime,
for the School of Cookery would afford admirable scope to the
talented I'.\YNK family or to the YOKES'S. It was a genuine onion,
and the cook pat it (I think) into the soup. At all events, when I
looked again, it had vanished, leaving not even a perfume behind.
The Lecturer gave one hint which struck me most forcibly. He
said, "If you want to make vermicelli soup, introduce vermicelli."
There was more true morality in this than in all his sermonising,
and it was a bit of genuine humour. Were I to draw out a lecture
I should certainly proceed on this plan. I should say (with safety),
"If you want shrimp sauce, make your sauce, and introduce
shrimps. If you want apple tart, make your tart, and introduce
apples," and so on. Your Representative is to be hired for a series
of Culinary Lectures on his own terms.
I now discovered that the cooks had been making croquettes, for
the Lecturer, as a sort of marry-and-live-happily-eyer-afterwards
sort of finish, said, " The three first rowa of the audience will taste
the croquettes." Immense excitement. Envy of the privileged three
first rows, and an inclination to depreciate the croquettes, were pre-
valent among the occupants of the back seats.
There was just a little stirring incident (" stirring " is the word,
as a cook, a spoon, and a saucepan were in it), which demon-
strated the difference between theory and practice. I will give it
dramatically:—
Lecturer (stopping in his discourse, and addressing a Cook). That
saucepan is too hot.
[Audience in admiration of the Lecturer, and rather annoyed
with the Cook.
Cook (speaking up for herself). No, it ain't not any too hot.
[Audience astonished at Cook, and expecting a row.
Lecturer (controlling himself, but ominously). Well,—you '11 see.
Your Representative was for applauding this scene. It was
capitally done. By the way, the Cook was right; at least we
didn't "see," and so I suppose the saucepan was "not any
too hot."
Advice yratis.—The Lecture should be given in a larger -room,
where three times the number could be accommodated, and where,
depend upon it, three times the number would attend. It is an
excellent notion, but let the motto be " Cookery! no preaching!"
and if the Lecturer must fill up the time, or feels that there is a
necessity for throwing a little life into the thing, let him have a
piajrist seated below, let him change his dress several times, with
imitations of French, German, Russian, Italian chefs, with a good
comic song to wind up with, and he will thus merit the entire
approbation of a grateful public, and above all of
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
P.S. I have seen The Wonderful Duck at the Opura Comique.
The Duck has been carved, I mean cut, since the first representation.
The idea of the piece is very fanny; the music very pretty; in some
respects more graceful than is either demanded or expected in
opera bouffe. Miss ROSE BELL, notwithstanding the drawback of
French accent, is capital, and Miss LA VERNE sings charmingly.
SIGHTS WHICH WE SHOULD SHOW THE SHAH.
WHEN the SHA.H OF PERSIA comes we are to show him Temple
Bar, and the Beefeaters at the Tower, and the fireworks at the
Crystal Palace, and the fleet reviewed at Portsmouth, and the
Waxwork Show in Baker Street, and the Freedom of the City at a
feast in the Guildhall. Bat His Majesty will get but a very poor
idea of the grandeur of our country from such paltry Shows as these.
The following must be ranked among the truly British sights, which
we may well feel proud of showing aay visitor who come to us :—
Oar London four-wheel cabs—their horses, and their drivers.
Oar Mammoth Iron Duke, and other noble public monuments.
Our splendid National Gallery,—i.e., not the pictures, but the
palace which contains them.
Oar Haymarket, and other vastly decorous West End thorough-
fares at Midnight.
Our ingenious devices for sluicing the streets, and sprinkling the
passers-by upon the pavements.
Our Divorce Court: and, hard by, our blatant fellow-countrymen
in waiting to applaud the daily egress of our Claimant.
Oar Hyde Park Sunday meetings.
Oar Income-tax returns for the last score of years or so, and the
pledges of our Statesmen for its speedy abolition.
Our thieves' kitchens and night cellars.
Oar penny gaffs and music-halls, and other intellectual places of
amusement which are sanctioned by the Legislature.
Oar site for our new Law Courts, and the sight of money lost in
interest since we purchased it.
Oar Museums shut on Sundays, and our gin-shops all left open.
Our street Arabs and organ-boys, and the gruesome slums they
sleep in.
Oar unrivalled Leicester Square, with its horse in statue quo.

PEESIANA.
ON the eighteenth of this month, the anniversary of the Battle of
Waterloo, bat too late for the contest at Ascot, the supreme Sove-
reign of a country which has no National Debt, bnt is badly off for

receive the usual English welcome of a congratulatory address
executed in ornamental penmanship.
From the hour that the SHAH OF PE RSI A left his own dominions,

i 'n VMr.EKLAIN, the LORD MAYOR, the Diplomatic Body, the Mana-
gers of the two Opera Houses, the City Chamberlain, the Court
Newsman, Mayors, Sheriffs, Port Admirals, Superintendents of Fire
Brigades, High Constables, and others in an exalted position who
may be brought into personal intercourse with His Majesty.
As Dover will be the first place in this country on which the SHAH
will set his Royal Slipper, we warn the Authorities of that port and
sea-side resort that if they desire to give His Majesty a complete
welcome, and one which will remind him of his own dear home far
away, they must have in readiness a trustworthy and efficient
butcher, with an animal from one of the Royal farms, in case the
SHAH should desire to repose, after the fatigue of his sea voyage, at
the Lord Warden Hotel.
The following account of what occurred when the SHAH reached
Astrakhan will sufficiently explain why the presence of a butcher at
Dover may be as indispensable as the attendance of the Mayor,
Recorder, and Town Clerk, and the Artists of the Illustrated news-
papers :—
'' When he alighted at the Government Buildings prepared for his recep-
tion, he was surprised to find a butcher waiting at the door, knife in hand,
with a snow-white ram ready for slaughter. More Ptriico the blood of
the animal was sprinkled on the threshold, to purify the house before the
Sovereign entered."
It is to be hoped that Fenian etiquette is satisfied with the
slaughter of one snow-white ram in each fresh country the Monarch
visits, and that it is not imperative for the butcher and his victim to
be in waiting at the front door, whenever the SHAH deigns to cross
a strange threshold. If so, very strict police regulations will be
required to keep in order the crowds which are sure to assemble to
see Buckingham Palace, the Guildhall, the Albert Hall, Marl-
borough House, and other edifices public and private, purified
by the Royal Purveyor for the SHAH'S entrance. (It would not sur-
prise us if the London butchers were to make the demand for sacri-
ficial animals a pretext for raising the price of meat.)
Is Guildhall carpeted? If not, there is still time to cover its
floors with the costliest products of Persian looms before the evening
of the 20th. Judge, after reading of the SHAH'S courtesy at Moscow,
whether it would not be a graceful compliment on the part of the
LORD MAYOR and Corporation to receive their Royal guest on the
manufactures of his own country :—
"On the second evening he has promised to attend a ball at the Governor-
General'H, having kindly I'onm'ntoJ to strain a point, and enter an uncarpeted
room, contrary to all rules of Fenian etiquette."
Any Duke, milHonnaire, or other distinguished personage, hoping
to he honoured with the SHAH'S presence at a grand ball, will act
wisely not to take up the carpets, as His Majesty cannot be expected
on all occasions to waive the scruples and prejudices of his country.
There are two things which all Kings, Princes, and Potentates,
Christian or otherwise, never neglect doing in any strange Capital
they may chance to visit. They receive the Corps Diplomatique, as
a duty, and they go to see a grand Ballet, generally on the first
night of their arrival, as a pleasure. The Persian Monarch does not
seem to be behind his Western Brothers in either of these respects;
and at St. Petersburg he "received the Diplomatic Body, having
previously been present at a review of the Fire Brigade." CAPTAIN
SHAW has, no doubt, taken note of this indication of the SHAH'S
tastes, and will be ready with his gallant men to give His Majesty
a warm reception, should he favour Watling Street with a visit.

A CHRISTIAN BABY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
LOOK at this, from the Liverpool Courier:—
WET NURSE.—Wanted immediately, a respect-
able Young Woman to take charge of a Christian
Baby. Good wages. Apply at * * * Bitkenhead.
Simyjes.
(What's "Simyjes"—baby's name? An ugly
one, but rhymes to images. But) Mr. Punch, I
feel inclined to say, with BRET HARTE'S Truthful
James—
"Do I sleep; do I dream?
Do I wonder and doubt?
Are things what they seem,
Or is visions about?"
Is the "Christian baby" supposed to imbibe
principles and doctrines with its earliest food, and
is it a caution to the "respectable Young Woman,"
that unless she be eminently respectable that
"Christian baby" will find her out? Or is it a
gentle bint that though " good wages" are given,
no douceurs are to be expected, as the Christen-
ing has already taken place? Also, I feel sad at
the dangers to which this " Christian baby " may
be exposed in its first troubled months of life.
Suppose the incautious hand of some disciple of
JENNEH should introduce into the "Christian
baby's" system vaccine from a degenerate cow,
or even lymph from an unChristian infant! I
most earnestly beg the "Christian baby's"
relatives not to risk the dangers of a wet-nurse,
but bring up the infant by bottle, on MBS.
MALAPROP'S " Consecrated Milk," which certainly
forms the most suitable diet for a "Christian
baby."
Yours ever, Mr. Punch,
Babbicombe Say. A CHRISTIAN MOTHER.
Inconceivable Enormity.
IP the throne of Persia were now filled by an
Irishman, who, having left it behind him, was
about to visit this country, who would possibly
commit the offence of declaring our illustrious
visitor to be at once the Shah and the Sultan V
Breathes there the buffoon who would venture to
call his Persian Majesty the Padisha?
SLANDER.— An old Cavalier poet speaks of
'' Fishes that tipple in the deep." Do the researches
of modern ichthyologists confirm this imputation on
the moral character of animals, which are generally
supposed to be of necessity habitual water-drinkers.'
Perhaps this is the most suitable place to hint that the week which
has yet to elapse before the arrival of NASSER-ED-DIN cannot be better
spent than in studying the geography, history, and language of the
country over which he rules. Most of us know something of Persia,
its cats, carpets, silkworms, roses, and bulbuls; but as questions are
likely to be asked by Society about the position of Persia on the
map, the leading events in its annals, and the exploits of such great
shades as DARIUS, CYRUS, and AHTAXEBIES—why does nqt some
enterprising theatre revive DR. ARXE'S opera ?—the perusal of one
or two standard works will save us all, particularly our young men,
from making incoherent answers at the garden-party, at the dinner-
table, in the ball-room and the How, and by the side of the gay and
festive Drive. The books recommended by the Civil Service Com-
missioners are Herodotus, MALCOLM'S History of Persia, MOBXER'S:
Adventures ofHajji Saba of Ispahan, the Persian Letters of M. DE ,
MONTESQUIEU, the works of FEHDUSI, HAFIZ, SADI, and ZOROASTER,
and above all, the Arabian Nights' Entertainments.
A Little Misapprehension.
MRS. MALAPROP has been greatly distressed at hearing that some
opposition was made in Parliament to money being allowed for the
_ Queen's Plates." The loyal old soul is happier now in her mind,
since she has been told that there never was any intention to refuse
to replenish the Royal dinner and tea services.
THB LAUNDRESS'S PABADISE.—Starch Green,
WHAT THE SHAH WILL DO.
(Contributed by an enthusiastic Gentleman, with the Shah on the
Srain.)
FIRST and foremost, the SHAH will be immediately presented by
Mr. Punch with a copy of the London <SViaA-ivari.
The SHAH will drive about in a <SAaA-a-banc.
After dinner, when hilarious, he will sing " Champagne Shah-ley
is my name."
He will receive from Windennere " potted Shah" for breakfast.
After several evening parties, he will be what the Americans call
"danced down to Shahs," and glad to rest.
He will call on the French Ambassador, and playfully hide behind
the window-curtains, where he will cleverly imitate the "miaou"
of a eat. His Excellency will detect him, when His Imperial Majesty
will slip out, and say, " Voioi le Chat.'" a jeu de mot which he has
been preparing for months past.
His Majesty will go and see all the Conjurors in town, and every-
body at all like a CAor-latan.
Depend upon the above information. (Contributors, be warned.)

followed immediately by The Sons of Ham.

I say, Bonus, or, as you call yourself, ROBEHTUS HUMUJS, about

They are being treated in the shabbiest manner. The Tories
intended to do what was right, and when turned out left orders, which
the Liberals suspended, in the case of the London men for two years,
and for four in the case of the Oatporters. At last, the Londoners
were paid up, in full, what was due under the Improved Scale, but
hitherto nothing has been done for the men at the ports. They tell
me, BOBUS, my son, that you admit their claim in the frankest
manner, but that with equally pleasing jolliness yon tell 'em that
you '11 pay up when the House of Commons orders you to,do it, and
deuce a twenty minutes before.
Come, BOBUS, that's not the way to go on with men who earn
money loyally, and want it badly. Play whatever you like, and
also Tommy, with the big whales, but feed the little fishes. Keep-
ing men out of £60, £90, and £120, as justly due to them as your
own well-earned salary, ain't the thing, BOBO mio. Don't wait for
a vote, ask for one; or pay up first, and then get the House's sanction
to an act which would have been one of honesty if you had done it
four years ago, but which now will hardly amount to reparation.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

I;M'I;MU.I,V dull,
0 dear Madam,
were all the pro-
ceedings in the
Houses of Hurgoes and CKnabs
during the past week. There, do
not be alarmed. Punch is not
going to give you th« Gulliver
nomenclature over again. One
lesson, like that of Canterbury
Cathedral, is not enough to teach
people not to let British workmen,
un watched, use fire on the roofs of buildings; bat we are quite sure that one lesson in any-
thing Mr, Punch wishes to teach you is quite sufficient.
In the Lords on Monday, June 9 (the day the Alexandra Palace was burned) EABL
RUSSELL came to the front. The veteran politician is about eighty-three, but he is as ready
for work as in the days when Mr. Punch pourtrayed him as the Boy who wrote " No Popery"
on CA nm.N AT, WISEMAN'S door. He had to-night to introduce a plan for the better Govern-
ment of Ireland. His speech was fitly preluded by LOBD (! H.AN VTI.LK'S statement that he had
received a telegram descriptive of the last freak of " an affectionate people." There was a
fire in Dublin. Of this the populace availed itself to break into a neighbouring spirit-store,
to get drunk, to beat the police, to wound the head of the LORD MAYOR OF DUBLIN, to stone a
Judge, and to try to prevent the firemen from extinguishing the flames. The military had to
be called in to remonstrate with the affectionate people, and seem to have given it them a
little hot, but not half hot enough, considering the atrocious outrages which they were then
committing, and upon which they improved, later, by breaking into poor persons' houses,
and robbing women of the articles they were trying to remove, in fear of further conflagra-
tion. It is right to state that none of the Home Rule papers defend the rioters, or abuse the
military, this time.
EAKL RUSSELL'S proposal is to abolish the Lord-Lieutenant, and to create a Secretary of
State for Ireland. He would make six jurors enough for a conviction, except in capital
cases. He would give the English Committee of Council authority over schools, taking away
all power assumed by the POPE. He protested against giving CARDINAL CULLBN complete
control over the education of Ireland.
LORD KiMiiKui.r:v made a moderate and respectful reply, but said that until the Cabinet
could consider the plan, he could give no opinion on it. But no one desired that Ireland
should be dominated by a Catholic majority, vice the deposed Protestant minority.
The Bill of the Earl was read a First Time. (The Gentleman's Magazine would have
called him an Eral.)
MR. BRUCE, in the Clinabs, said that horses formed part of the last demonstration in the
Park, but this was contrary to rule, and should not be allowed to occur again. (Laughter.)
Asked questions about the Shah-in-Shah, Ma. GLADSTONE said that some discretion must
be allowed to the distinguished visitor himself, and that we must not map out all his move-
ments for him as if he were to be drilled. We mention, dear Madam, that you shall have the
fullest particulars of his Majesty's reception at Punch't office.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL (surely you were not bothered by our calling SIR JOHN the
Fir^t Snilpal Adviser) moved the Second Reading of the Judicature Bill. This important
measure has been passed by the Hurgoes, in whose House there is so much legal knowledge
that the CKnabs might reasonably accept such a measure without much debate. But sundry
thought otherwise, and it was proposed to send the Bill to a Select Committee; and had this
been done, it could not have passed this year. If you care to know what the measure is to
do, a few words from SIR ,1 OHM COLERIDGE'S speech will enlighten you: —
"The main principle of the Bill would be the formation of one Queen's Court in England—one
supreme Court of Judicature—in the various branches and divisions of which law and equity, in their
perfection, would be together administered. All the existing Courts—those at Westminster and at
Lincoln's Inn, together with certain quail inferior Courts—would be merged into, and form parts of, thia
one supreme Court. The Court itself would be divided into two parts, one of which would be called the
High Court of Juitice, and the other the Court of Appeal. The present Courts of Appeal would form parts
of the High Court of Juitice, >nd the Court of Appeal would, as it name indicated, be an appeal from the
various division* of the High Court of Juitice. in all the branch Courts law and equity would be ad-
ministered concurrently. Every Court will be competent to hear everything (except wktn the abominable
belli of the neighbouring Churches ttrike up), and the old historical names of the Courts are to be
retained."
That, Madam, is as much as you can want
to know about the measure. We hope that
neither yon, nor any of your amiable de-
scendants, will ever need law; but, should
the case be otherwise, and the proposed Act
come into operation, its excellence will be
revealed to the parties concerned. It is
convenient—that is, it will save trouble—
to add that the debate was adjourned, and
resumed on another night, and the Bill was
read a Second Time, and waa to be Com-
mitted in the regular way.
Then we had a debate on the postal
arrangements between Zanzibar and Aden.
That does not sound interesting, but when
we say that our revered Ministers, and
specially Ms. ROBERT LOWE, proposed to
spend £26,000 on what they could get done
for £15,000, and were ignorant of the ex-
istence of a document illustrating their
wisdom, and therefore asked to adjourn the
debate that they might get np the facts,
you may think that the topic deserved some
attention. MR. DISRAELI s virtuous mind
was so moved by the "extraordinary"
conduct of the Government, that he took a
division against adjournment, and, though
Ministers triumphed on this by 205 to 151,
the victory was one of the kind which the
late lamented Sovereign, Kix<; PYRREUS,
did by no means admire.
Tuesday.—The Hurgoes read a Second
Time a Bill for preventing little children
from being used as agricultural labourers
until they attain the mature age of eight
years. LOBD SALISBURY approved of the
principle of the Bill, but feared it would
* intensify the dislike of the Farmers to
Educational measures." His Lordship
knows the bucolic mind.
The CKnabs sat on the Rating Bill, on
which much wise talk was expended, and
then (two counts being attempted) they
had discussion on Naval Promotion, _ but
refused SIR JOHN HAY a Committee
thereon.
Wednesday. — A Scottish Roads and
Bridges Bill was read a Second Time, and
we are glad of this, as we are beginning
to think of travel, and some of us will use
roads and bridges in Scotland. It is a pity
that the Bill does not contain a clause for
visiting with condign punishment the
Highland drivers who spoil the effect of
the glorious northern scenery by their
brutal cruelty to the poor horses. It is of
no use complaining of this in Scotland—
you are sure to be told, in any individual
case, that doubtless it is an error to depart
from humanity, but that MR. MACFLAY-
HORSE is a very decent body and a regular
communicant.
MR. MUNDELLA tried to promote a Bill
for lightening Female Labour in Factories.
This sounds excellently, but MR. FAWCRTT
has something to say on the other side
about the jealousy of Male Labourers, and
their wish to prevent women from earning
as much as they can. However, the clock
limited the hours of Parliamentary labour.
Thursday.—LORD POWERSCOURT moved
the Second Reading of a Bill for altering
the days on which Shooting (at birds, not
landlords) begins in Ireland. Grouse and
moor game he proposes to kill on the 12th
of August, and partridges, landrails, and
quails on the 10th of September.
LORD CAIRNS asked LORD HALIFAX when
we were to have the final accounts of the
Banda and Eirwee Booty.
LORD HALIFAX replied that he did not
know. "Good boy, always speak the
truth."
MR. PETER TAYLOR again demanded the
recognition of the Spanish Republic. He

BALL OR BALLET?
IN a programme of the entertainment to be given
by the civic authorities to our Illustrious Visitor, it is
announced that:—
"Upon the arrival of the SHAH, the PHIKCH OP WALES,
and the LORD MAYOR in the Guildhall, dancing will begin;
the library also will be tued for dancing."
No better reception oould have been devised for the
entertainment of an Oriental potentate than the arrange-
ment of dancing to begin the moment that he arrives;
but who are to dance? The SHAH, probably, would
care little to see dancing dervishes. The dancers to suit
him should, one would think, be a company of artistes
selected from the corps deballet of the principal theatres.
Theirs is the sort of dancing which an Asiatic monarch
would prefer to any other admitting of less decorative
costume, and, being promiscuous ; Aldermen and Common
Councilmen and other men dancing before his Oriental
Majesty along with their wives and daughters, and
the numerous fair guests voluntarily assisting as
odalisques and bayaderes. Surely the civio dignitaries
do not expect the Su ui to dance too '(
"The Moon is Hot."
THE Philosophers, who never know anything, are
making a great fuss over the above Discovery, as they
are pleased—very much pleased—to call it. Dear readers
of Punch, who are therefore also readers of the other
great poets, how you must smile at the Philosophers!
How wise you are never to take any notice of your so-
called instructors, and to stick to the Poets, who, as MR.
CARLYLB says, are the real Doers. The Moon is hot I

SPEAKINO of a middle-aged Gentleman who had married

ence between them. Bat he's quite old enough to be

took a more than usually appropriate time for this demand, for at
the hour he spoke the evening papers were in everybody's hand,
with the account of the Ministry being kicked out, an officer's
being murdered, the ex-Premier s having fled, and Madrid in
homd fear of an insurrection of the rabble, whom the last Govern-
ment but six or eight had the idiotcy to allow to arm.
MB. FOHSTER introduced his Improved Education Bill, and it is
very good. He goes somewhat further with compulsion, and is
resolved that all pauper children shall be taught. He makes
most considerate provision for the payment of the school-fees of
other children, whose parents are unable to pay. Do you know.
Madam, that One Farthing a day pays for a child's tuition, and
may make him a respectable member of society? That the BUI is
a good one may be inferred from the fact that fanatics express
"bitter disappointment" with it.
Friday.—LORD SALISBURY is aptly described by the Daily News
as "a man of letters who respects his Pen." No wonder that he
was moved to protest, to-night, against the slovenly style in which
Acts of Parliament are drawn. A Bill which the Hurgoes were
asked to read a Second Time proposed to provide for those whom
SIR FRANCIS HEAD'S young lady called Hilly Jittimites, but so
contrived that it abolished the whole law of Court Martial in India!
We had, in the Clinabs, another Rating Debate, in which SIB
GEORGE JBNKINSON brought up the question of rating personal
property. He raised a prolonged discussion, which MR. DISRAELI
said had been very useful, but it came to nothing.
Then we got on the Fiji Islands, which MR. M'ABTHUB wants us
to annex. MB. GLADSTONE delivered an elegant and elaborate
speech on the subject, which Mr. Punch ventures to condense
"Annex Fiji?
0 dear, not I."
MB. WHALLEY finished the week by moving for copies of papers
connected with the Tichborne case, and was politely informed by
the SPEAKER that he was entirely out of order. Mr, Punch had left
the House, but has no doubt that MR. WHALLET smiled at a fuss
being made over suoh a ridiculous detail.
THE CAT, THE BEA.R, AND THE LION.
A FABLE.
(Freely adapted from the Punch-a-banfr'a, the Sanskrit original
of the Fables of PILPAT or BlLPAl, first translated into Pehlvi
l» order of KHOSROU-NouRsmwAN, the great Persian King of
the Sassanian dynasty.)
A PERSIAN Cat, whose name was NASR-ED-DIN,
Thick-furred of tail, and velvet-soft of skin,
Whose eyes, in changing lustre, shot and shone
With diamond's, ruby's, emerald's light, in one,
Thus spit from out his beard, on his divan,
Amidst the crumbling splendours of Tehran,
"Too long have I, soft pillowed, softly furred,
Here on the carpet of contentment purred,
While round my cushions, bigger beasts of prey,
With mutual growl, have tugged, each his own way—
Till by my passive purring bolder grown,
The rug 1 lie on soon they '11 call their own.
But how pan a poor Cat, though Persian, dare
Beard British Lion, or brave Russian Bear?
To the wise Jackal for advice I '11 go,
Which of the two were best made friend, or foe."
So said, so done: the Jackal's cave he seeks,
And sage solution of his doubt bespeaks. •
BlyJaokal winked his eye, and twitched his tail:
"_Who would read, now-a-days, must run by rail):
Lion and Bear at home 'twere best to know,
If you would gauge their use as friend or foe.

His economic taste a joint offends,
Which but cheese-parings craves and candle-ends.
Prom feline moods reclaimed, he sets his heart
On money-making, and industrial art,
And the deep throat, heard winds and waves above,
Now roars as gently as a sucking-dove.
The wary Cat spent some observant days,
Watching the British Lion's walks and ways,
Saw how the teeth, by Russia used to tear,
The British Lion takes his cheese to pare:
How claws wherewith the Bear rends limb from limb,
The Lion serve his candle-ends to trim.
"A Lion this ?" quoth he. "Negatur flat,
This is no Lion—only a big Cat !—
And as Cat should to Cat—my wavering ends:
Do your worst, Bear I Lion and I are irienda 1"
BAD JOB FOR BETSY.
THE Post announces:—
"A WOMAN FINED FOR BETTING.—On Wednesday, at the Birmingham
Police-court, MRS. COOFBR, -wife of a well-known book-maker, was fined
£25 for illegally assisting in betting transactions. Police officers in disguise
visittd a barber's shop in Bell Street, where MRS. COOPER was booking bets
on various races. The premises belonged to her husband."
If so, women seem to be getting their rights with a vengeance.
However, MR. and MBS. COOPER being partners in book-making as
well as in matrimony, the former will have to bear at least his part
of the lino which has been inflicted upon his better half.

[JUNE 21, 1873.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PROGRAMME FOR THE WEEK.
ATICTWATORY.
Wednesday, June 18.—
Gunpowder Day. Arrival
of the SHAH. Sleepless
night on the part of the
Mayor and Corporation
of Dover. Scene in the
Straits and Streets. All
the officials, up to the very
last moment, studying
Persius and other standard
works on Persia. Ex-
citement at the Lord
"Warden Hotel; several
waiters lose their heads,
and obtain no compensa-
tion. The SHAH receives
his first (but by no means
his last) address on vellum.
Presentation by the LORD
CHAMBERLAIN to His Ma-
jesty of the new number
of Punch; the services of
SIR HENRY RAWIJNSON,
SIR ARNOLD KEMRALL,
&c., not required to in-
terpret the meaning of
the Cartoon. General
inspection of the South
Eastern Railway. The
SHAH'S introduction to an
English Palace. Distant roar of the great City; proximate serenade
of organ-grinders. The SHAH retires to his State Bed—his first
impressions. Increase of traffic on the Metropolitan Railway;
St. James's Park Station brought into uee.
Thursday, June 19.—The SHAH and his suite great]y pleased at
the thoughtful care bestowed on their accommodation: Persian
carpets and Persian ware in all the rooms; Persian cats rubbing
themselves against their legs; Persian sherbet to drink; Persian
pipes to smoke; illustrated copies of the Arabian Nights, freshly
gathered roses, and otto of roses on every table. Begging letters;
tradesmen's cards and circulars; invitations to visit all the principal
towns and cities in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, to lay
first stones and to assist at inaugurations, and to be present at
fetes, balls, banquets, soirfes, conversaziones, garden parties,
charitable anniversaries, receptions, reviews, sham fights, and after-
noon drums. The SHAH expresses a desire to inspect the Treasury;
his disappointment at finding no treasures; the CHANCELLOR or THE
EXCHEQUER is introduced to him, but he is not satisfied. Visits the
Bank of England, the Tower (where he is much struck with the
Beefeaters), and some of our principal jewellers, and is better
contented. Ascends the Monument, and is taken to see one of our
great markets—Billingsgate. Is shown over St. Paul's; special
arrangement between the Dean and Chapter and the Government as
to the remission of the usual fees.
Friday, June 20.—Round of Sights. Site of the New Law Courts,
rite of the New Natural History Museum, finest site in Europe;
the Duke of Wellington on Constitution Hill, and all the other
public statues and frights (the SHAH and his party depressed
in spirits); the British Museum, the South Kensington Museum,
and SIK JOHN SOANE'S Museum; the Royal Aoadtmy, the Royal
Observatory, and the Royal Mews. In the evening the SHAH
attends the grand Reception at the Guildhall, and is presented with
the freedom of the City, which, it is explained to His MAJESTY,
will enable him to get through the block on Ludgate Hill and other
crowded thoroughfares. Particularly pleased with the Oriental
magnificence of the LOBD MAYOR'S footmen.and interested in the
biographical account of Gog and Magog. Discovers in the course
of conversation that the jurisdiction of the Corporation of London
is not so extensive as he had imagined, and mentally determines
that the Local Government of the Metropolis is not one of our
institutions to be copied and introduced into Persia.
Saturday, June 21.—The SHAH writes home. Afterwards receives
the Corps Diplomatique and Deputations. Visits Madame Tussaud's.
Explores the principal bazaars, the Soho, Crystal Palace, &e., and
compares them with the (same establishments in his own country.
The Persians being excellent horsemen, the SHAH and his suite ride
in Rotten Row, and then take part in a match at Polo. Unluckily,
their love of the chaoe cannot be gratified at this season of the year,
and, as it is understood that they have come to England to see the
evidences of pur advanced civilisation, nothing is said to them about
pigeon-shooting. At night, State visit to the Opera. Disappoint-
ment at not hearing the opera of Artaxerxes. The Ballet not equal
to expectation.
Sunday, June 22.—The Great Lion of the Season goes to the
Zoological Gardens. The beasts behave better than the company.
Monday, June 23.—Little excursion to Portsmouth and Spit-
head. Another gunpowder day. Blue jackets, blue dresses, blue
iky, blue sea, blue bonnets, and blue Peters. Not a Naval Review
"in the strict sense of the word," but something so very like it that
Persia not being a great naval power, the Hn MI and his suite will
probably return to the Caspian without having detected the differ-
ence. The newest things out in iron-dads and armour plates, very
ugly and very expensive, and warranted to be obsolete and only tit
to be broken up and sold as old metal after another ten years
of experiments and improvement*. Fete at night at the Inter-
national Exhibition and Albert Hall; pipes and pictures, songs
and sherbet, machinery in motion and people in motion to catch a
glimpse of the SHAH and his jewels. School of Cookery unfor-
tunately closed for the day.
Tuesday, June 24.—Midsummer Day. If the weather is not
like the middle of summer, or any other time in summer, apologies
and explanations to the SHAH. Yesterday, Navy and blue jackets,
to-day, Army and scarlet tunics. Review, "in the strict sense ot
the word," of troops in Windsor Great Park. Quantity small,
quality good. Compliments to the DUKE OF CAMIIUIIIOK and MR.
OARDWBLL. The latter, haying for some weeks past been taking
lessons of a Persian Moonshee, replies in a few graceful words in the
language of HAFIZ and ZOROASTEB.
BARS FOB BOB-MAJORS.
HANO the poker on to a string, strike it with the tongs, and you
will immediately twig the value of a suggestion pnt forward in the
Choir by DR. FKHDINAND RAHLIS. ''Go, bid thy Mistress, when
my drink is ready, She strike upon the bell." Had there been
no bell at hand, Lady Macbeth might have banged the tongs against
the poker, if there had been a poker and tongs in Macbeth's Castle.
They would have fully answered her guilty purpose. But there is
an opposite kind of purpose that similar means may be made to
answer. .Pit. RAHLES proposes the substitution of steel bars for
Church bells.
Steel bars are more musical and sonorous, more precisely tune-
able, more easily made to discourse tin ir notes and harmonies,
lighter, more compact, and very much cheaper than bells. They
are not liable to be cracked like Big Ben—that should have been
transferred to Hanwell, or Colney Hatch. Their manufacture is
comparatively simple; they can be made of any size, from a magni-
tude equivalent to that of said Big Ben to that of a bell suitable to
the dimensions of Little Bethel. They are rung with greater safety
than bells, and hung with greater facility; no more trouble than
hanging takes MR. CALCRAFT.
According to DR. K A 11 i.vs, steel bars in place of bells have been
introduced in Germany and in the United States with great success.
Anything that tends to promote harmony among our kinsmen of the
great Teutonic and Angle-Saxon races must gratify every true
Englishman, and in regard to bells, it is an agreeable disappoint-
ment to learn that steel bars have be en selected as substitutes for
them in the United States, because it was to be expected, if any
modern invention had been adopted in their stead, that Yankee
church bells would be superseded by the fteam whistle.
As steel bars are susceptible of permanent magnetism, it remains
to be seen to what extent, if uted for bells, they would have the
advantage, not adverted to by DR. RAHLES, of attracting people of
iron constitution to Church.
EYES RIGHT 1
"Little seems to b« known of the persons composing the new Spanish
Cabinet, but the Finance Minuter, SENOK CARVAJAL, it stated to be a Madrid
oculist."
THEY make and remake Cabinets with great expedition in Spain, so
perhaps by this time an aurist or a dentist may be Chancellor of the
Exchequer in that country. But if SENOH CARVAJAI is still Finance
Minister, any one may see at a glance his peculiar fitness for the
office. With the experience he must have had, he will have an eye
to the main chance, and be able to keep a (harp look out upon his
subordinates. The Spaniards are far too stately and ceremonious
a people to bandy slang, or one could fancy the Senor's political
opponents condensing their opinion of his appointment into few
but expressive words, and describing it as " all my eye."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
He 'ridel in a Cab or two, and faithfully reports thereon to the
Editor.
HILK Ton ride in your coach and four,
loll in your Victoria and pair by the
banks of the blue Serpentine, or wave
your hand indolently from your
cushioned barouche on your road to
Richmond, I, Sir, have to represent
You in vehicles licensed to carry
twenty-six people at once, or, at best,
to take only two inside.
Hence it is that Your Representa-
tive ia one of the greatest employers
of London Cabs. He is a fortune to
the drivers and proprietors, as, being
of a timid and retiring disposition
(wherever there's a chance of a row),
and, never having acquired proficiency
in the art of self-defence, he invari-
ably gives at least sixpence over the
regular fare, so as to avoid all dis-
cussion and interchange of compli-
ments, whereat, not having crushing
repartees ready at hand, Your Repre-
sentative generally gets worsted, after having been held up to the
execration of a dirty crowd as a penurious aristocrat grinding down
the honest working man, or having been chaffed out of his life by
the unscrupulous driver in front of the open windows of his (Your
Representative's) Club.
The Cabman has an advantage, in badinage, over his respectable
fare, similar to that possessed by the French over the English
Dramatists in writing for the stage, that is, they have such a field,
and such scope; they can say anything and everything, while the
virtuous fare is gagged by his respectability as tightly as is a
criminal on his trial by the English law. Brilliancy is lost on a
cabman; he winks at your sky-rocket of wit, which goes far above
his head, and is down upon you with his bomb-shell.
Therefore, Sir, I pay, as the stage Yankee speaks, through the
nose. But what do I get in return for this? Thanks f Rarely.
What have I previously got for it Y Nothing; except twenty
minutes' worth of worry, nervousness, danger, jolting, anger,
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness.
Were all Cabs good in every respect, the lives of vehicle-patronis-
ing Londoners would be lengthened by many years.
Sir, emphatically, our London Cabs, taking them all round
(Heaven forbid I should have to do so!), are what Hamlet said the
player's " faces" were, in Act iii., So. 2, whore Mr. Lucianus enters
to go through his part, and is most rudely interrupted by his highly
educated audience. (SHAKSPEARS evidently meant this as a satire
on some of the swells of his day who would talk aloud during the
performance. Bat this by the way.)
You don't, perhaps, expect much from a Four-wheeler, but, hang
it, yon do from a Hansom. Hansoms now-a-days are a snare and a
delusion. They are calculated to ruin your hat, and your temper.
There is none good, no, scarcely one. Like the gods of the Heathen,
they are all become abominable. I had not intended writing this,
but the edifice of injuries was crowned on my way to the Inter-
national Exhibition, when I was going, last week, to represent you,
Sir, at the Cookery Lecture, and I can no longer control my just
indignation. 'Tis the last bluebottle that rouses the sleeping Lion
(1 am getting up such Eastern proverbs for the SHAH), and the
Hansom that took me to South Kensington caused me to shed tears
of vexation.
I selected him from many others with such care and discrimination
as I should have used at Tattersall's in buying a horse. I eyed his
points—cab-horses have heaps of points, all more or less prominent—
and I took him after dismissing three others who sought my
favours.
Let me tell you of one Hansom refused by me earlier in the day.
It came out of a stable-yard: the horse was being led by an ostler;
the driver (dressed in a Jemmy-Jessamy sporting style, with a wisp
of dark blue ribbon round his whip, probably left there under the
impression that the University boat-race was still going on, as he 'd
been all this time getting to it) was urging him by jerking the loose
reins, and making noises which were all more or less varia-
tions on such original themes as "Tohkj get along, Ey'np!"
and so forth, while, the animal itself was limping and halt-
ing as though he were trying his legs, one after the other, for
the first time in his life, and was doubtful of their capabili-
ties. The wretched machine (including the horse in this term)
stumbled alontr, and the man had the impudence, the coolness, the
unspeakable effrontery, to hail ma, and say, "Hansom, Sir?" But
then and there I had my revenge. I replied, with biting sarcasm,
but ineffable politeness, "No thank you, Pm in a hurry." After
this I shot on,like the advertising picture of M u. WALKINGFAST, the
bootmaker (capital name I), and left the poor crazy wreck to flounder
about as best or worst it might. I just heard him anathematising
me, the cab, and the horse, as I turned the corner. Excuse
me if I am proud of the exploit: it may be weak, but seeing that
it is scoring the bull's eye after a quarter of a century of misses,
I do think the exultation pardonable. I make a present of my
repartee to the public. It will always tell: it will never grow old:
it will improve by use: it will be better for keeping—in short, like
every other effort of genius, it is not for an age, but for all time.
I will not here dwell on the dangers and difficulties of entry
common to all Hansoms, as to what you 're to lay hold of, what
you "re not to lay hold of, what you 're to cling to, when you 're to
sling to it, how you've got to keep your eye on the hind-quarters of
the horse, how you 're to back in, still holding on to something, and
bow you 're to stoop cautiously, for fear of the loosely strappe'd-up
window catching your neatly-brushed hat—on these troubles I will
not now dilate: another time. Sir, I was in a hurry, as I often am;
And when in a hurry, there is nothing in nature so irritating as a
slow Hansom. This cab was not only slow, it was doddling;
that's the word, doddling. Also, it was waggling; going from
one side to the other, like one of those jointed toy-serpents
that you hold by the tail, and making very little more progress.
To whichever side it swerved it got into danger; in avoiding a cart
on the left, it threatened an omnibus on the right; in giving a wide
berth to a waggon approaching, it narrowly escaped the hind wheel
of a barouche passing us. Life was pro tent, not worth having on
such terms. It was sudden extinction or premature greyness. It
was Westminster Abbey, or Mrs. Somebody's Hair-restorer. 0 Pilot I
'twas an awful night—I mean a fearful drive! The horse was the
most perfect multum in parvo I had ever seen. I mean he was too small
for the cab every way, and he had nearly every fault that you could
imagine in so small, a compass. He had a kink in his moral and

walked a little—in fact, he did everything a little and nothing well,
or for long. The trick which was the most unsatisfactory and
perplexing to the person inside was a dejected way he had, after
the failure of any such great effort as breaking into a _ canter, of
hanging his head so low as to be completely out of sight. For
minutes, while going down Piccadilly hill, there was nothing before
me but the headless trunk of a horse, slowly and unevenly trotting.
It was ghostly—it was Gustave-Dore-ish. I had a mind to push
up the little peep-show trap above, and have a look at the driver,
bo see that he 'd got his head on all right. I became nervous: I
began to think that all this was some horrid dream, and that I was
in the hands of a goblin cabman driving a nightmare.
We passed nothing; we followed everything. I envied people in
four-wheelers and 'busses. I growled to myself; I implored him
through the trap, I urged him onward by drawing his attention to
the fact that a 'bus which had stopped three times on the same route
had always caught us up and passed us. The driver replied, " All
right!" to me, and said "Tohk!" to the headless horse, which
responded to the very gentle touch of the whip (which the man
used as if it had been a fishing-rod, and he were dropping a hook
with ground-bait very quietly into a stream) by jibbing, tossing its
head, cantering, and then relapsing into the old desponnent trot.
Sir, I paid that man one sixpence, at least, over and above his
fare. I mide no remark. I was speechless with gratitude for my
safety. Had the authorities been inclined to permit it, I would
have gone into the Albert Hall, and celebrated my safe arrival with
a piece of sacred music (my own composition) on the organ, which
should have been afterwards known, like the "Gottingen Te
Deum," as the Got-baok-again Te Deum.
However, were I always to insist upon performing this on the
Albert Hall instrument whenever I had survived a drive in a cab,
I should be the most voluminous composer of this or any other time,
and the organ would soon be worn out.
Another day I selected a brilliant-looking affair. Black turned
up with blue and blue turned up with black, silver-plated harness,
a horse of a peculiar colour, not unlike that of the variegated
granite rocks on the Jersey coast—an excellent notion, by the way,
tor material for the animal in an equestrian statue—and reminding
me forcibly of the sand in one of those glass mementos, hell-shaped,
of the Isle of Wight called a " Trifle from Shanklin," and meant,
if used properly, for a paper-weight. _ Would yon gather from this
that it was a sort of roan r I believe it was. Somebody to whom I
described this said, "Oh! that was a Strawberry Dun." It might
have been, but it seemed to me what a strawberry might look like
under a sharp attack of measles. He was stepping along at proud
as a peacock when I hired him.
From the moment I got in, bumping my hat as usnal, the Straw-
berry Dun showed what a trained humbng of a steed he was. His
airy manners forsook him completely; he jogged along at a slow

pace, until I began to think that "I really would speak to the
driver "—when all of a sudden he plucked up as we were crossing
a thoroughfare, and in glorious style charged another Hansom
which was driving out of a street at right angles to us. How a
collision, in which the horse would have been the principal sufferer,
was avoided, 1 don't know, but avoided it was, and he went on
in his old butter-and-egg fashion, until a nasty corner offered him
a chance of displaying his original genius. He was going round this
as though he were practically discovering some new force in nature,
when his knees failed him, and, after recovering from such a stumble
as would have ruined less gifted creatures for life, he resumed his
former ruminative trot. The Cabman's knowledge of short cats would
have been most praiseworthy, if in every cage the short cuts had not
been blocked up by coal-carts, carts without coal, carts with sacks,
and trucks; also cabs, meeting us where there was only room for
one at a time, which disputed the ground inch by inch, and before
which we had to retire. The Strawberry Dun performed this grace-
ful act to perfection. It only wanted music to have made it worthy
of a circus.
I paid this Cabman his exact faro, and he asked me, "How's one
to live if one only has his 'iaot fare 1"' I did not stop to answer the
conundrum.
Another horse was what I believe is called " a weed." He was
long, bony, lanky, rat-tailed, and long-legged. . He looked like
pace. When I was seated in the cab, however, he went either as if
he was of an inquiring disposition, and wanted to see what sort of
fare he was taking, or as if he had a stiff neck, and was obliged to
keep his head always turned quite round to the right. Perhaps this
was his merit, and he saw what to avoid in front and at the back.
If so, he went cautiously, and walked round the corners.
In fact we walked the greater part of the time. When I remon-
strated, the man said, "He'd ha' gone faster if he'd known as I
was in a hurry;" but they always have some answer, and it is sur-
prising if it isn't of the sort to which repartee is impossible iu the

information under heading of "The Race Week"? Rhinegan Champagne should he a

very much less germane than Qoosegan.
THE SHAH AT SOMEKSET
HOUSE.
SOME "Spinsters" write to the Timet a
nice little letter, stating certain " Income-
tax Exactions" to which they have been
subjected, and would continue to be if
they did not annually take a great deal of
trouble. Their artless tale would perhaps
enlist the sympathy of the SHAH. The
sole income of the "Spinsters" is 1! 100 a
year, a pension bought for them by their
late father during his life. They were for
many years overtaxed for it at the rate of
30>. a year, not knowing that their pittance
was exempt from confiscation. Having,
however, found that out, and applied for
restitution of the overcharge to Somerset
House, they were informed by the authori-
ties there, that only three years' excess
could be recovered. The recovery of that
little cost these poor ladies a heavy ex-
pense "for postage, oab-hire, and the
like." Thus it appears that Government,
having pillaged individuals by mistake,
refuses, on being convinced of that fact,
to make any but a very limited restitution
of plunder, and also throws every possible
obstacle in the way of obtaining even that.
These things are, probably, managed other-
wise in Persia, now at least under her pre-
sent Sovereign, howsoever they may have
been in some former reigns.
It may amuse an enlightened and right-
eous Monarch to observe, further, that not
only does our Government resist with all
its might a demand for the redress of
demonstrated and acknowledged injustice,
but continues, in the face of demonstration
and acknowledgment, to repeat the wrong
it has done, so as to re-impose on the over-
taxed the trouble of seeking redress .on
every occasion of being repeatedly robbed.
The " Spinsters" say that :—
"The strangest part of the matter, however,
it that the overcharge (till continues, and has to
be recovered by the following procen :—Printed
forma have to be obtained from Somerset House,
and certificates from our agents that the over-
charge is correct. These papers are sent to the
District Surveyor, where other papers, specifjing
whether our parents are dead, whether the
income ie for maintenance or education, vested
interest or contingent, are received; and all
these sets have to be returned to Somerset House,
whence, after considerable delay, the overcharge
is returned."
When our illustrious visitor the SHAH is
conducted over Somerset House, care will
of course be taken to show his Persian
Majesty the machinery at that establish-
ment designed for the obstruction of
attempts to get surcharges of Income-tax
refunded. It is one of those specialities of
the British system of taxation which those
who work it will naturally think likely to
interest the SHAH. He, indeed, might
profit considerably by studying it, if his
views on the subject of extortion were
similar to those of Oriental potentates in
general. But no. The SHAH is a just
ruler, and wise as well as just. Such a
policy on the part of his Government as
that which the "Spinsters" were fleeced
by must, he would see, necessarily tend to
provoke corresponding tactics on the part of
the tax-payers. That is. it would justify
them, in their own minds, in doing their
utmost to evade taxation and defraud the
revenue.
But there! Perhaps we shall shortly see
in the Timet an acknowledgment, by the
"Spinsters," of the receipt of £10 or £12
"Conscience Money," for Income-tax over-
charged, from the CHANCELLOR OF THE
EXCHEQUEB.

THE PERILS OF THE PARKS.

1AIN1Y, to skip in Victoria Park seems to be
a dangerous outburst of animal spirits,
which brings the skippers under the notice
of a Police Magistrate. The next time we
visit Bethnal Green Museum, and take a
turn in the adjacent Park after seeing the
pictures, we shall be careful to walk along
its paths with the utmost sedateness and
deliberation.
If such an innocent act as skipping may be followed by fine and, possibly, imprisonment,
we must all mind what we are doing, and when the warm summer weather comes and tempts
us into the Parks, be on our guard not to show our delight at the phenomenon by so much
as a single hop, skip, or jump.
One hardly likes to think of the tremendous consequences of even a momentary forget-
f ulness of the etiquette all are expected to observe who ramble in the Parks. A Member of
Parliament, Mu. AYBTON for instance, going down to Westminster on a sultry after-
noon in July, and finding there was No House, might stroll into St. James's Park,
and in the exuberance of his delight at
having escaped several hours of Local Taxa-
tion or Courts of Judicature, be betrayed
into an acceleration of pace, an impetuosity
of movement, which might easily be mis-
taken by some vigilant guardian of 'public
propriety and decorum for a skip. Would
the offender have to appear at the West-
minster Police Court? Would he be allowed
to remain at large on bail until the next
morning 'i
Perhaps other actions, which we have
hitherto looked upon as perfectly harmless
and unobjectionable, are daily exposing us
to all those pains and penalties which an
infringement of Park rules and regulations
sets in motion. Perhaps it is a misde-
meanour to run after a friend in Kensing-
ton Gardens, and endeavour to attract his
attention by calling out his name in a load
tone of voice 'i Perhaps it is petty larceny
to pick up a stone and throw it into the
Round Pond for Oscar's delight and recrea-
tion? Perhaps it is downright felony to
allow the same moist and intelligent animal
to carry in his mouth, beyond the Park
boundaries, the fragment of stick we have
thoughtlessly abstracted from the grass?
Are the daisies Crown property? Are the
other wild flowers counted every morning
and evening by the Park Keepers P
The Parks at the present time are delight-
ful resorts, and we shall forfeit many
agreeable hours by shunning their shady
walks and emerald paths, but, until satis-
factory replies are returned to our questions,
we cannot, we dare not, venture within such
dangerous precincts. Fortunately, the Mays,
and lilacs, and laburnums are past their
prime.
BISMARCK AND BIGOTRY.
Ajf article in the Saturday Review on "The Jesuits." referring to
the antagonism heretofore existing between that Order and the
Bishops of their communion, contains the following passage : —
"PKINCK BISMARCK has done his beat to promote a closer alliance between
them in Germany, juat as the kindred though far feebler policy of the Eccle-
aiaatieal Titles Act helped to rally all U >;u tn Catholic partial in England
under the banner* of Ultramontanism."
Exactly so. Oolv the Ecclesiastical Titles Act did no more than
help to narrow all Roman Catholic parties in England to Ultramon-
tanum. Its work remained to be completed by the Vatican Council
in declaring Papal Infallibility. That finished it. The Ecclesias-
tical Titles Aot has been wisely repealed. Who would like to give
gratuitous offence to his Roman Catholic fellow-subjects?
Here and everywhere elae in Christendom people are now com-
fortably divided into Protestants and Papists. Roman Catholics
should accept and not resent that denomination. Ultramontanism
is Popery in a simply definitive sense. Protestantism and Popery
are now marked off from each other, by a line which no believer on
one side can pass, and very few thinking men on the other will.
How many such are likely to commit themselves to all that Popery
comprehends? High Anglican parsons appear to have nearly ceased
"going over to Rome," in whose eyes they occupy the same eccle-
siastical level with MR, SPUROEOIT. Is not all this just what PRINCE
BISMABCK would rejoice over if he were in MB. GLADSTONE'S place?
He would probably not regret the feebleness of the policy which has
nrlped to obtain such results. The stronger policy which he now
pursues is perhaps necessitated by the excess of noly zeal which
iometimes renders Popish ecclesiastic* a little troublesome. When
the Ultramontane Bishops are quiet, PRINCE BISHABCK will doubt-
less know how to deal with them in a spirit of enlightened tolera-
tion. Perhaps he will be happy to concede almost as much to
ritramontanism as British Statesmen have yielded—as soon as he
can afford it.
NOVEL SUPPER BOOM.
WE can imagine few people indifferent to an invitation to the
Entertainment to be given at the Guildhall to the Su vii. but it is
open to a doubt how far guests may like to be included amongst the
ninety who are to enp in "the Court of Sewers."
THE APPROACH OF SUMMER.
Now Spring hath fled; but yet, is Winter past?
With frosty breath he has returned in June
Oft. when from east and north a biting blast
Nipped the young flowers, and hushed the song-bird's tune.
An 1 in my grate at times have I been fain
To light a costly fire of precious coals,
Which at one-pound-sixteen a ton remain;
So we burn money—bless the colliers' souls I
The berry coupled with the name of " goose,"
Whereto ola English cookery added fool,"
Hath yielded pies and paddings to our use
At Whitsuntide, as due by antique role.
But Whitsuntide was late, nor can we call
Potatoes early that were premature,
And watery, more than waxy, almost all;
Such lack of sun our gardens did endure.
Deferred, too, was the customary boon.
Of young green peas, and men said, "Where are they?"
On old Ktrfo GBOBSE'S birthday, Fourth of Jane.
They were not yet when it had passed away.
But see who hither, clad in Orient state,
Comes as the Rising Sun from o'er the seas I
May glorious Summer on his chariot wait,
And bring on our potatoes and our jieas.
Competition and Cleverness.
IT appears that the Government has found it necessary to issue a
warning to Civil Servants, threatening dismissal as the penalty of
betraying official secrets to the Press. The system of Competitive
Examination was designed to provide the Civil Service with clever
young men. It has provided it with young men so clever that they
are able to obtain appointments on the Press, and then turn their
official knowledge to account in journalism. Thus the Competitive
Examination System has more than succeeded in providing the Civil
Service with young men who are clever. Those young men are too
clever by half. The Government finds that in producing the
Competition Wallah it has driven its pigs to a pretty market.

Really Thoughtful.
TEE arrangement for throwing the full glare of the
electric light from St. Stephen's on to the SHAH'S bedroom
windows at Buckingham Palace, was admirable. How
soothing when he came in, tired, from the Ball, and
wanted to go to sleep I Why did not LOBD SIDNEY
insist on fireworks all night in the SHAH'S bedroom,
crackers in the cupboard, Roman candles on the toilet-
table, and Catherine-wheels as castors to his arm-chairs?
COMMANDING FIGURE.
A Gor>D_man struggling with the storms of fate is, we all know, a
very admirable sight, and also a most agreeable one to those who
are themselves in tranquil circumstances. Such a man, so holding
his own, we admire, although his own may be contrary to ours.
The good old POPE is such a man, and holds his own so; his own
claims that is to say: fortunately not the powers he lays claim to.
He has the courage of his opinions; and you may esteem that,
although you deny them. According to a Roman telegram, in a
speech addressed the other day to the Cardinals, His Holiness ex-
pressed himself as much grieved to hear that SIQNOR RATTAX/I had
received Christian burial. His perfectly consistent grief was occa-
sioned by the fact that SIGNOR RATTAZZI was a person "who died
without the consolation of religion, in obedience to the wishes of his
friends." The Holy Father added:—
"SIONOK RATTAZH always fought against the peace of Italy and the Holy
See; still the judgment of tiod ii unknown to us, nor mutt we seek to guess
it. But I experienced a very painful impression on learning from the news-
papers that the clergy of Aleuandria were present at the funeral obsequies.
Those priests showed themselves greater courtiers than ministers of God. I
hope, however, that the news given by the papers is false."
A subsequent telegram says that the Italie mentions a rumour
that Mou. SALVAI, Archbishop of Alessandria, where SIONOB RAT-
TAX/r was buried, has been summoned to Rome by the Vatican, "ad
verbum audiendum." Very likely. He may expect that he will
hear a word, and to what effect we can conjecture, though unable to
toll what precise word it will be. The verbum, whether verb or
noun, substantive or adjective, will no doubt be a part of speech
such as may be called strong language, if it be not anathema itself,
as a menace if not a judgment; or perhaps some more colloquial
expression equivalent to anathema. Ad audiendum verbum may only
mean " to receive a wigging;" but that is the least that the offend-
ing Archbishop can look for. He will learn what the POPE thinks
of countenancing the obsequies of an excommunicated Statesman.
Let us admire the thoroughness and consistency of the POPX in
having let him know so much as he has already; and this we can do
all the more serenely for that His Holiness is able to pronounce only
spiritual censures, and has no power any longer to enforce them by
the secular arm. But, in fulminating words, though mere words,
boldly in the face of Europe and the World, he stands in a far
grander position than that of Ajax merely defying the lightning.
He commands the same respect as that which one accords to his pre-
decessor, BENEDICT THE THIRTEENTH, who, whether he was lawful
Pope or no, believed himself to be, and, having been deposed by
a Council which he did not recognise, used to excommunicate
everybody regularly twice a day. Perhaps Pius THE NINTH will
finally do likewise.
What 'a in a Name P
MB, FITZGERALD, R.A.—no, we mean MB. R. A. FITZGERALD,
which is an autre pair of chote—has written an entertaining account
of the doings of the twelve English Cricketing Champions in
America. The title of the book is deceptive to the Cockney mind,
being called alliteratively Wickets in the West. It is not for a
moment to be supposed that the Secretary of Lord's ever played
cricket in his " West," but he must not be surprised, if, at Eenning-
ton Oval, he should hear BILL SOMEBODY, the eminent professional,
criticise the name thus—" Vicketi in the Vest! Well, I 'd ha' as
soon thought o' Cricket in a Coat!" There is something, yon see,
in a name.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

AH from an aspersion on the
Persian (the very smallest jest
connected with the SHAH is
welcome, to judge from Mr.
Punch' t "Correspondence") is it
to say that he has in some way
acted on Parliament, and that
the influence of the Constellation
Lion and Sun has conduced to a
legislative dulness, against which
even Mr. Punch struggles in
vain. In fact, our Statesmen
plead guilty to thinking of no-
thing but NA88B-Bp-Dnf. MB.
GLADSTONE allowed the Commons to rise early on the Friday, that they might get into the City,
and MB. PELL wanted them to rise earlier still, declaring that he should otherwise never get
his carriage, with MBS. PELL, to the Guildhall in time; and besides, he had had no lunch,
and wished to have some dinner. You see, Madam, we are all in a state like that of your
own excellent household on the day before the night of your charming hall, when you are
shoring up your drawing floors from below, and tastefully festooning the chintz-covered props
with lovely flowers from your villa near the Thames.
MONDAY, June 16. — To-day Ministers were helped out of the Zanzibar business (the
postal contract to spend £26,000 when £15,000 would do) by accepting MB. BOUVEBIE'B
proposal for a Select Committee on the subject. He was not over polite, however, for he
objected to let any of the Cabinet sit in judgment on MB. LOWE, declaring that this would be
like calling on a St. Giles' jury to try a member of the Swell Mob.
We sat till two o'clock on the Hating Bill, and, if Mr. Punch could be severe at such a
time, he would say that folks whom it is proposed to Rate show quite sufficient energy in
resisting an imposition which is supposed to be fair. But, to do each " interest" justice, it
is very ready to assent to the taxation of every other.
MB. BBUCE was asked whether he knew how many people had lately been killed in the
streets of London. He said he was very sorry (and we do not doubt it) to have to state that
the numbers had not decreased. In 1872 the drivers destroyed 118 persons. The police force
had been increased, and everything was done that could be done. This latter statement, of
course, is too absurd to be dealt with seriously. Nothing will have been done until heavy
traffic shall be excluded from the great thoroughfares during the hours passengers want
them. As regards furious driving, the Magistrates are much too punctilious in requiring the
most positive evidence, MB. BKUCK thinks. If there is a doubt, it should go in favour of a
wounded pedestrian. Yet some pedestrians, especially ladies, are wilfully careless, and
choose to think that a horse at average speed can be brought to a dead standstill in a second.
In the Commons MB. WHALLEY obtruded some more Tiehborne queries, and MB. LOWE
said, one evening, that those who had the advantage of hearing the sort of questions MB.
WiiALLK.r asked, would "not be surprised" at his (MB. Lows' s) begging him to reduce his
inquiries to writing. "We rather like MB. WHALLEY (apart from his absurdities), and
therefore decline to quote a wish of Dogberry's.
ay.— Can you, Madam, wish to know anything about the system of Patronage in
the Kirk of Scotland? Of course not. It is enough for you to know that the system of
Church Government in Scotland, doubtless, has its merits, but that the theory which makes
the taught judges of the teacher perpetually produces the most ludicrous results. When any
half-dozen old women may complain to toe authorities that a Pastor does not speak loud
enough, or speaks coldly, sneezes too often, or looks about him too much, or combs his hair in
a non-Calvinistio fashion, it is not wonderful that Clergymen are much exercised in the
North.
Wetlnnttlay. — We debated MB. _FAWCETT'S Bill for relieving Parliamentary candidates
from election expenses, and throwing them on the localities. It was decided by 205 to 91
that things should remain as they are.
This was the day of the SHAH'S arrival. The topic is so far Parliamentary that at
night the bright clock-tower light, which should have been extinguished, the House having
risen, was turned upon Buckingham Palace,
and if N \ssu-i:n-l)iN'S shutters were not
what MKS. MALAPBOP calls "arithmeti-
cally" closed, His Majesty must have
emitted some choice Persian execrations
at having his slumbers hindered by the
AYBTON Comet.
Thursday.—MB. AYBTON said that the
iron floors of the new National Gallery
must be covered with wood, because a large
number of the persons who would go there
to study asstheties and the Old Masters
wear iron nails in their shoes. So we must
urn the risk of using an inflammable
material.
One night this week—it does not matter
which night—an Honourable Member, in
alluding to the Irish, called them " aliens,
and enemies." He remembered LOUD
I.vxniii:iioT and the "aliens in blood,
religion, and language." MB. GLADSTONB
gently deprecated such phrases. But the
Home-Rulers accept them as the highest
compliment an Englishman could pay. By
the way, the "affectionate people" are
committing murders by the dozen just now,
and we suppose that a return on the sub-
ject will soon be asked.
.Friday.—LORD VIVIAW mentioned that
"extremely rough diamonds" now seek to
insert themselves into the Army by means
of competition—including two that had
been expelled from Woolwich. The DTKK
OF C.V.M iiitinri B said that he did what he
could to prevent the admission of other
than gentlemen, but the fact was that mar-
vellous testimonials were always sent in,
and that the two expelled persons were
described to him as most perfect characters.
The MAHQUIS OF HEBTFOBD'S " blood boiled
at seeing MB. CARDWELL'S name at the
head of the Army List, instead of the
venerated name of the Illustrious Duke."
The Commons (after more Rating) ad-
journed soon after six, that everybody
might go to Guildhall, to the ball in honour
of the SHAH. And truly it was worth
while to go and see the opening Quadrille.
Listen, dear Madam.

EXTRACT
From the most private Journal of KHAN MAHOKXED HAasAN-EL-
SAHEE-ED-DOWLAH.
Iir the train of fire, at Dover. Thanks he to Allah, we are off the
sea. The Feringhees said it was calm during our passage. And
the SHAH-IK-SHAII—may his name be crowned with honour!—kept
his head erect and his countenance cheerful before these Kaffirs, and
was not cast down, neither was his face blackened in crossing the
sea of the English. This power was not given to us, hi» servants.
Hoir should it be? May the Illustrious not ask to see the journal
of this crossing kept by his servant EL SANER. All I know is that I
lay ia a narrow box, and felt rollings and great throbbings, and
smelt grievous smells, and heard thunderinga far and near, and
many tramplings and olashings of chains over my head, till mfr
entrails were loosed with a great fear. I gave myself up altogether
to misery, as one in the realm of the Djinns, or as he that passeth
over the hair bridge of El Sirat, in the Valley of Judgment. They
that sat erect tell me we saw many war-ships of iron and brass, some
like birds with wings, and others like houses sailing without sails,
and bearing cannon that fired without hands, and manned by
monkeys or demons. How these things may be, truly I know not.
We are in the land of enchantments and wonders, praise be to the
name of the Prophet, and protection to his servants.
We flr through this land in the cushioned carriages of the rail-
way. This thing we have seen elsewhere, but nowhere so swift aa
here. All here is by steam—more even than in the land of the
Russki and the Prusski. and the faee of all things—excepting only
the heavens—shines. There is a dark grey shadow always over the
sky; I cannot speak with the astrologer of the SHAH-IN-SHAH, for
he is in another carriage. But I fear the signs of the heavens are
inauspicious, and that we did ill to come hither in this conjunction
of planets. The English people gather in crowds to do honour to
the SHAH-IN-SHAH, and wave their hats and shout. Who are we
that we should shine in the brightness of his face P
The women here go unveiled, as in other lands of the Feringhee.
They are more moon-faced than the women of the .Russki, and the
Prusski. My friend, a great Moonahee of the household of the
Elchee RAWLINSON, may his name be honoured, tells me that the
women of the English have lately risen up in revolt, and come
out of their anderoons, and are now striving with men ia all
things, and often beating and buffeting them. A wise man would
have foreseen this. Why did the English let their females come
abroad out of the apartments of the women, and lay aaido
their veils P A fire is good, but only while it is kept in the
fire-pan. Let the woman that can rule a man rule in the
chamber, not in the street; so strength hath its right, and weak-
ness is not encouraged to its undoing. In this land we see many
more people of peace than soldiers, and all the soil is as a garden:
even the beasts in the fields are clean and well cared for. Herein
this land is different from the land of the Ruaski and the Prussia.
Nor do the Khans and Elchees and other servants of the Great
QUEEN go so softly, or bow to the ground so often or en low as the
servants of the CV MI and the EMPEKOH in those lands. Nor do they
wear coats buttoned up so tight, nor so many stars and badges ol
honour on their breasts. The Russki and Prusski said we should
find all men in this country loving money and not oaring for
honour. This I do not know. We shall learn. Only I know,
unworthy as I am to know anything of the Lion and Sun of the
Universe—that the SHAH-IN-SHAH had blackness of face by reason
of the grievous bowing down and the constant ordering of all things
in those lands, whereby we could not move, but ia a line first
drawn out for all. At last did they not order even the SHAB.-IN-
SHAH! Then their faces were blackened before him; and we had
a hard time, and much stick. Here I hope all will be well.
Allah grant so much to his servant.
(At the Palace of the Great Queen, in the first hour of the evening.")
My head aches sorely. We have all drunk touch rain-water, and
our robes of honour are damp and denied. Here the Great QUEEN
may be mistress of the earth and the sea, but Shaitan is master ol
the heavens.
It is now what these English call Midsummer, but the cold is as
that of our second month of the winter solstice, and the rains are as
the latter rains of sowing time.
It Is, in this land, as if for money and steam they had given sun-
shine. Our hearts are black in spite of the whiteness of the face of
-he Su Ait-iy-Sii.Mi before this people.
(Two Hours later.)
I have eaten a dinner of the English. Allah keriml it was
rood. I have drunk of their sherbet that goes off by steam, and,
is with the bursting of guns, like other things in this country. It
iras very good, and made my heart merry within me, so that I sang
this verse:—
'I also am going by steam, like all things in this land of wonders. My
•nvid is aa a wheel, that turneth and grindeth wondroualy, and my heart is
full of still brightnest, like the shining of the sea under the moon, and the
sherbet of the stranger il as the screw of the fire-ship that carries my soul
swiftly through the waters."
Even while t sing, I am summoned to the presence of the Siiiir-
IK-8HAH—majr he be strengthened!
(At the fourth hour of the night.)
The SHAH-IN-SHAH gent for me to attend him to the magical
instrument which these wonderful English have brought to his
chamber, whereby he e»n send his orders to Tehran, and receive
words thence, as lord talkuth to slave in a chamber of audience.
The magician Who Works the spell was also at hand.
The SHAH-IN-SHAH spoke. "Call me up the Prince Governor of
Tehnm."
"He is called."
"What says heP"
"That this must be Shaitan, and not the SHAH-IN-SHAH, that
talks to him so many thousand miles away, and therefore he will
not listen."
"Let him hate stiek, that he may know it is the SHAH-IN-
SHAH."
Then came the message that stick was being given to the
Governor.
The SHAH-iN-SaAH wished to hear the cries of his slave under
the ferashes. But the magician said this was beyond his power.
Then the SHAH-IN-SHAH was pleased to talk with his servant of
this wonderful land, and the sea-journey, and the ships, and all the
marvels he had seen; and bade his servant show him the journal
thereof.
Then I said, "Lo! 0 SHAH, how can I show thee that which is
not? Was not my journal swallowed up in the jaws of the Sea as
we landed at Dover P And who is thy servant, that he should
recover back its prey from the ocean P"
Then the SHAH-IN-SHAH was gracious, and went again to the
magical instrument, and spuke again with those at Tehran.
And, lo ! he made hia wives to arise even at the fifth hour of the
night—for this also was by magic, that here it was the first hour of
the night, when at Tehran it was the fifth—and dress themselves
in their best robes, and come down to talk with their lord and
master; and woe be to any that shall grumble, now they know
for a truth that the ear of the great SHAH is upon them, even
from the ends of the earth!
Much wonder was uttered among the moonshees and khans, and
aghas and meerzas of the Great QUEEN, as we sat at meat, that the
SHAH-IN-SHAH had been pleased to grant such honours to RRUTER
KHAN, and to concede unto him the power to make channels
wherein the wealth of the English should flow into Persia. But
they do not understand how he is to get that wealth into those
channels. Then I said to them: "The English have steam; have
not we Persians stick—that does as great wonders for us as steam
for you P" And I went on to explain to them the power of stick;
how, if the SKAH-IN-SHAH once had the KHAN REUTEB tight
in Tehran, with the Royal ferashes standing over him, REUTBK
KHAN would have no chance bat to bleed either blood or
tomauns; and that in our country wise men would rather give up
their coin than their cuticle. Now, REUTBB KHAN was no doubt
a wise man, or the Sinn -1N-8 u A it would not have chosen him
for this great favour. Besides, cannot the English make money,
by help of steam and the l)j inns together P and has not this RECIEB
lived among the English till he has learnt all their secrets P And
did not SOLOMON, the wise king, compel the demons to give up their
treasures P and shall not the SHAH-IN-SHAH know how to compel
even RETJTBS KHAN P


Doubly Destitute.
VAGABONDS are generally credited with cleverness; if that is the
only credit they get. But street-beggars exhibit want of originality
at least as lamentable as their physical destitution. They continue
to importune you for a "copper," although copper coin has long
been superseded by bronze; and no mendicant asking alms ever
thinks of saying, by way of novelty, "If you please, Sir, would you
have the kindness to assist a poor man with a postage-stamp P"

PASSENGER AND PEOPLE.
THE People in their thousands
So close assembled were
That they obstructed Charing Cross,
And crammed Trafalgar Square.
The glorious British Public,
What went they forth to see,
And there did stand till after six,
Where they had come ere three f
With eyes intently gazing,
They stood at Charing Cross;
Yet not as round a prostrate steed,
Surveying " that^ere "oss."
Their aspects were erected,
And they looked right forth; for ah!
They fronted the Charing Cross Hotel,
And were waiting for the SHAH.
As, bound upon a journey,
I rushed to catch the train,
The British Public blocked my way,
And did my course restrain.
I blessed the British Public,
With the accents of a man:
And I also blessed and praised the SHAH,
And wished him at Teheran.
The British Public'
Was pure good-will 's display.
They were not as supernumeraries
Engaged to shout for pay;
And the SHAH was more to gaze at,
As a Monarch of renown
Than the scene of a horrid murder is,
A dead horse, or a house burnt down.
RESPECT OF COURT.
IN the coarse of the Monster Trial in the Court of Queen's Bench,
which is exemplifying the expedition, efficiency, economy, and
common-sense of English Law to an admiring world, VISCOUNT Si.
LAWRANCE, M.I'., was examined one day last week. In cross-
examination, his Lordship stated that, in an interview with the
defendant, he had asked him questions suggesting certain inaccuracies
relative to places, distances, and events, for the purpose of testing
his suspected veracity. Subjoined is an extract from the Times'
report of the evidence of LOKD Si. LAWKANCB, cross-examined by
DR. KBNEALT :—
"Did ROOBB ever walk that walk with you ?—Never.
It was altogether untrue, then ?—It was.
Was it the • trap ? '—Tea.
Was it not the tuggtttio falsi, the suggestion of a falsehood ?—No, it was
not.
TUB LORD CHIBF JUSTICI.—You may call it a 'trap,' but I see nothing
wrong in it at all. If you have a suspicion that a man is guilty of fraud and
falsehood, there is no harm in putting a question which tends to show it.
DB. KBNEALY.—Oh, my Lord, I think in any case it is wrong to suggest
a lie.
TUB LOKD CHIEF JUSTICE.—It is not a lie, and that is a very offensire and
unwarrantable imputation to make upon the witness.''
It is surely no contempt of Court, but quite the reverse, to say
that LORD CHIEF JUSTICE COCKHUHN is a gentleman.
A RBWABD'WHICH ROGUES REAP.—The County Crop.
