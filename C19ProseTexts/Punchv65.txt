That he may have no face to frown withal.
[A cannon goes off. All the Kings and their armies run away.
Enter SIR GARNET Wolseley, meeting GENERAL PUNCH.
| Sir Garnet. Right welcome Thank you much for coming out.
General Punch. When I'm not thanked at all I'm thanked enough.
I've done my duty, and I've done no more.
My modesty's a candle to my merit,
It shines itself and shows my merit too.
Sir Garnet. All right. Come to my tent.
General Punch. Lead on. I come. Ereunt.

Near Coomassie.
Enter SIR GARNET and GENERAL PUNCH.
General Punch. At length the enemy advances nigh:
- I hear them with my ear, and see them with my eye.
Sir Garnet (quietly). Less noise, brave friend. I like thy sportive mirth,
But there are times and seasons.

Genius. Although 'tis Christmas, when all jests are free,
'Tis fit you show you are not false to me.
Fighting is not a jest, and there's a land
Where, facing angry myriads, brave men stand.
Punch. When I am false to thee, my work is done.
Let one warm word be mingled with our fun.
In not a home where Christmas, all aglow,
Bids the pulse quicken, and the wine-cup flow,
Let England's sons at home forget the toast
To England's brave ones on that savage coast.
Soon may we learn their glorious toils are o'er ;
Soon hail the Victors on their native shore.

For º that now breathe English-speaking breath
And all by whom such breath shall yet be breathed.
What would these pilgrims think of us, or say—
The natural guardians of that double shrine,
If we let tomb be Yº: or house decay P-
“How shall the worldly honour the divine?”
And if we cherish SHAKSPEARE's house and grave,
For pilgrimage of all of English tongue,
DAN Chauce R's Tabard were’t not well to save
From the destroying hammer o'er it hung F
There still, from Southwark's ever-flowing tide
Drawn back in its deep yard, the hostel grey
Rears its quaint galleries, and chambers wide,
And stately stables of the ancient day.
Here stood the stair where HARRY BAILLY, stout,
Received to harbour gentle Knight and Squire,
And dainty Prioresse, and—rougher rout—
Hot Reeve, sly Frere, and Miller fierce as fire.
Where liquorish Monk fair Wife of Bath first saw,

And jolly Franklin, and grave Man of Law,

Here all the motley-clad, full-breathing, life
Of the third Edward's day to being came *
Forth from that brain with moving pictures rife,
Andranged itself in the grey Tabard's frame.
And they that would live o'er that life again,_
English of far-off lands, and times to be,
Will gather still to Southwark High-Street, fain
The Tabard's gallery-girdled yard to see.
And shall they hear, that, in this year of grace,
We valued such old memories nºt a pin,
Or CHAUCER's countrymen were in no case
To save from downfall CHAUCER's haunted Inn?
Too poor to buy and consecrate its walls
To him who gave them tenants for all time,
That future pilgrims, seeking these grey halls,
May still hear Mary-Overies' mellow chime,
For bed-ward Canterbury H. rung,
Or rung to rouse those pilgrims for the way;
As in that April morn, by CHAUCER sung,
“At Southwark, in the Tabard, where they lay”?
ENLIGHTENED PROTEST.
SIR,-In reference to MR. ForsTER's remarks about the National
Anthem being sung in schools, I protest inst the practice, and I
refuse to send my children to any school where that fulsome, unphi-
lanthropic, uncosmopolitan, fawning h is used.
I object to it, first, because it recognises an Influence about which
I know nothing: secondly, because it implies that human beings
have some communication with that Influence: thirdly, because it
adulates a monarch, and I am a republican: fourthly, because it
;". a bellicose spirit, and P am for peace at any price:
fifthly, because it expresses a wish that this country should be more
prosperous than º other; and, sixthly, because it asks what is
not in the interest of trade, which is promoted (though I despise the
means) by frequent transmissions of the so-called Crown.
I desire to see the National Anthem abolished, and
I am (to use the conventional phrase),
Your obedient Servant,
“AN ADVANCED THINKER.”

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
º
S a kind-hearted Lady, you
will r t, dear Madam, to

day, June 23) Loºp REDES-
not his heart in
bleman with
out. He, therefore, asked
eave to postpone a certain
- Life – Peerages Bill. His
Lordship has seen too much of this Wale of Tears to care greatly for “the Slings and
Harrows of outrageous torture” (amended quotation), but we f. he will soon be all right
again. “Gout,” says HoRACE WALPoLE, wisely, “is not a disease but a remedy, and there-
fore 'tis absurd to try to cure it.” Besides, it clears the mental faculties, and, prompts a
fine flow of that comminative language which every Englishman, proud of his native tongue,
should know how to employ. -
LoRD DELAwark had a Bill for preventing Children under twelve from being employed
as Acrobats and the like. Not well drawn, 'twas withdrawn. We are told, Madam, that
the days of treating performing children cruelly have gone by, and we will hope that this is
true. Mr. Sleary, in Hard Times, when offering to retain Sissy Jupe in the equestrian com-
pany, observes, “I don't pretend to be of the angel breed mythelf, and I don’t thay but what,
when you mith'd your tip, you'd find me cut up rough, and thwear an oath or two at you.
But what I thay, Thquire, ith, that good tempered or bad tempered, I never did a horthe an
injury yet, no more than thwearing at him went, and that I don't expect I shall begin other-
withe at my time of life, with a Rider. I never was much of a Cackler, Thquire, and I have
thed my thay.” May all ºur teachers ofittie Acrobats and equestrians be like Mr. Sleary.
Do you remember the Murillo, and the Northfleet's terrible fate? Better forget them, for
the Spaniards have served us just as-we deserve to be served. The Murillo and her crew
have been released, and pronounced free of condemnation, but the Master's certificate has
been suspended for twelve months, because he did not pay sufficient attention to the fact that
he had run into some vessel. We will not, by further comment, insult the relatives of those
who were killed on that night. “Oh, for one hour of PALMERston l’”
On the y Estimates, CAPTAIN ARCHDALE described the Sandhurst examination as
“gruel and inhuman.” We should like first to see the papers which have so exasperated the
gallant Captain, and next, we should like to ask any high-class boy at Rugby or Harrow
whether they could frighten him. The other grievance complained of, namely, that the Sand-
hurst students “are not allowed brandy and soda at breakfast,” we own we do consider
horrible, especially if they have had too many B.'s and S.’s with their pipes over-night.
Tuesday.—To procure the assent of the Canadians to the Washington Treaty, we, England,
undertook to guarantee a large loan to enable the Dominion, to make a certain Rail:
way. But as this way of putting it sounds a little coarsely, in fact the shocking word
“bribe” was used in º debate, the Government says that it offers the guarantee in order to
compensate Canada, for the Fenian Raids, in respect of which the Americans utterly refused
to pay a cent. The Canadians are such capital people, and the Canadian ladies are so
charming, that we do not care in what way we oblige them, provided they are obliged.: .

In the Commons MR. Hunt asked whether
a Government Inspector of Schools had re-
fused to allow the National Anthem to be
sung by some children. MR. ForsTER
admitted that it was so, but said that the
Inspector was very loyal, and had made a
mistake. -

(as given in the Standard), but
“I know you Lawyers can, with ease,

but you have, doubtless, a good library, and MR. John GAY's
works are not absent from it. Do not ict us have to mention

We went into, Supply, and MR. ForsTER asked and received
£1,299,603 for Educational purposes. He stated that our advance
in this matter had been considerable, and sound, and sure.
MR. ForsTER can speak becomingly of a valuable official, what-
ever one of his colleagues may do. In referring to MR. HENRY
CoLE's resignation of his office at South Kensington, MR. ForsTER
said that the gentleman in question was a most devoted, efficient,
and painstaking#"; servant, with remarkable capacity as an
administrator. r. Punch has said the same thing in verse.

GRAN VILLE's opposition to the proposal was that of a thorough man
of the world, and it is just such a man who can best decide upon a
question of the kind.
humbugs.
A debate took place on a very serious and painful subject—the
fearful slaughter yearly made by the wild beasts in India. The
terrible fate of a gallant young officer, LIEUTENANT GILEs, who
lately lost his life in tiger-slaying, has brought the topic vividly to
the notice of households whose loved ones are in the East. The wild
animals kill some ten thousand human beings every year. The
revival of a Hunting Caste is ºff. or, as the DUKE of ARGYLL
said, of Ti ºf: Surely England, a nation of sportsmen,

Jungle.
LoRD SALISBURY declared that if MR. CARDwell, should be turned
out of the War Office, his successor should be asked to reverse the
Druidical decision that Oxford should be a military centre. Some
sh words, “odiousness,” “motives,” and “imagination”—you
Call up the blanks—were exchanged between the Marquis and
EARL GRANVILLE.
Mr. Punch apologises to the nation for depriving all political pro-
ceedings of novelty, by the fatal and True-Thomas-like accuracy of
his prognostications. He has “the tongue that camot lie,” and he
is very sorry for it. In his Cartoon of the “Palladium,” and the
verses appended, he so exactly prefigured the course of the
ATToRNEY-GENERAL on the Jury Bill, and so precisely indicated
that the Sacred Image was to be only burnished, not spoiled, that
he merely records that, *i; SIR John gracefully gave up all

OUR REVIEW.
Poem on the Alexandra Palace, Muswell Hill, Destroyed
June 9, 1873.
Penge.
Fire,
Composed by Joseph Gwyer, Potato Salesman,
Half the Profits will be given in aid of Sufferers.
- E consider this poem
no small potatoes. It
has its merits, it has
its faults, but so has
the Iliad, and so has
Proverbial Philoso-
phy. But, as the
ancient classic poet,
HoRACE, remarks:—
“Ubi plura nitent in
carmine, non ego
aucis
endarmaculis.”
or, to make the senti-
ment clearer, to the
inhabitants of Penge,
“Where a thousand
potatoes are mealy
and white,
To rage that a dozen
are rotten, were
spite.”
We remark, obiter
that ſºon could
not have turned that
translation better.
MR. Gwy ER is what
may be called a free-
hand poet. He has
all an Englishman's
and potato salesman's
scorn and contempt
- for tyranny, and he
refuses to be bound in the rhythmical fetters which, as MR.
Çobbert has told us in Rejected Addresses, were invented by
the monks to enslave the people. But with a free hand he has
a full heart, and we have no doubt that he gives in his business
as overflowing measure as he offers in his song. His poetry is much
better than most which we have º been called on to review. If
he has not the vigour and subtlety of BRowNING, at all events MR.
Gwyer never exercises the soul of his reader by compelling him to
give a second thought to the meaning of a line. If he lacks some-
thing of the tender grace of TENNYson, MR. Gwyer successfully
resists any temptation which may be presented to him to over-refine
his melodies. If he wants the passionate fervour of Sw1NBURNE, it
is the more creditable to him, for SHAKSPEARE has told that the vege-
table in which Mr. Gwyer deals has a tendency to soften the heart.
| And if he is without a good many other º: which a good many
other people are with, he is himself, an I, an Ego, and a poet. e
shall therefore ify ourselves and our readers by an extract or
two from a which is sold at four times the price of the original
edition of Orion:— -
“On Muswell Hill there lately stood,
The Alexandra Palace great and good,
Both to our own and foreign land,
It claimed from each a prestige grand.
“With works of art it did abound,
Which were wont the ignorant to astound,
The sightly dome for miles was seen,
Surrounded by the pastures green.
“Full many a goodly sir upon the opening day
Sported with ; 4. #. one’ the time away, º
And seem'd to like the stimulating meeting,
For interchange of kindly word and greeting.
“But on the 9th of June the palace caught on fire,
Each moment seemed to send the flames much higher,
Flinging around with consternation spell,
Such sad results as no mortal could foretell.
“The shouts of alarm at this dread º:
* were stricken and did prostrate lay,
As if they’d been wounded by some deadly foe,
So painful was the unexpected great blow.
“While some were witnessing this awful view,
Others were anxious as to what they should do,
Some it was seen appeared quite romantic,
While the poor º girls seemed nearly frantic.”
We have then a graceful compliment to the prompt generosity of
SIR SYDNEY WATERLow, the Lord Mayor, and to the ready charity
of the Directors of the Crystal Palace, who may be said to have
heaped coals of fire on the heads of their unfortunate rivals by
giving a benefit for the relief of the distressed Alexandrians. Then
the Bard of Penge boldly reverts to the Catastrophe.
“In two short hours it was a blaze,
Which took some years to build and raise,
Grand Alexandra's noble dome,
Alas! all vanished the Ninth of June.
“I hope when you peruse these lines,
The author's object you’ll have in mind,
For ever will his stand point be,
That one great act of charity.”
If we hint that we perhaps could, by taking our coats off and
thinking our hardest, invent a better--or, at least, a more conven-
tional rhyme for “lines” than “mind,”—we say this to show that
not even our admiration for a great bard and potato salesman drives
us into the unqualified eulogy in which so many of our contempo-
raries delight. But, as afºresaid, non paucis maculis, and there are
as few spots upon MR. Gwyer's verses as upon the very best
potatoes which he supplies to the fortunate residents at Penge.

frequenters. The following is one of these liberal and
enlightened mandates:—
“No Dog is allowed to go into the water.”
There are, in the ponds of Richmond Park, very
few water-fowl which a dog going into the water
would chance to frighten; and there is never any con-
course in which he could shake himself and sprinkle
3. about the ponds on º Of all the Parks,
ichmond Park is that one in which all possible objec-
tion to dogs going into the water is the very least.
another ºf the ordinances above quoted is this:—
ut
“Any Dog brought into the Park which may reasonably be
supposed to be in a rabid state will be destroyed.”
Dread of º: was evidently before the eyes of
the Statesman and Sage who framed the Richmond Park
Rules. This it evidently was which prompted him to
decree that dogs should not go into the water there.
But, if not, there, by how much the rather not in the
other Parks, where water-fowl abound, and the water-
sides are crowded with the British Public? inasmuch
as, if dogs must not go into water in the Parks, and
those, for dogs whose owners live near the Parks, are
the only places where water is handy, the dogs belong-
ing to such persons can seldom, if ever, go into water
at all. . It is evident that the Park Rule which prohibits
them from being allowed to was conceived by official
science and sagacity, in the idea that free access to water,
instead of being preventive, is provocative of canine
eSS.

Venator. My friend, you have kept time with my thoughts.
Piscator. I am right glad to see you so fairly risen. I heard our
hostess herself bringing the soda-water to the chamber where you
lay. You do not eat of this º trout.
Venator. I cannot. But I will beg a courtesy of you, that you
will give me another cup of your hottest.
Piscator. 'Tis said by Travellers that the boughs of the trees in
China are all laden with Tea-leaves, º the hot water
streams into which they fall, while the cows and the cocoa-nuts
afford a sufficient quantity of milk, and the stones of the sugar-
plums serve for lump.
Venator. I could listen to your discourse for hours together.
But, Sir, let us be stirring. You shall bear my charges for this past
night, and I will bear yours to-morrow.
iscator. Nay, we will settle the score between us, first, for last
night's diversion. This paper is in your hand, is it not ?
enator. Marry, Sir, I must acknowledge my own subscription.
Piscator. Why then, Sir, you stand indebted to me in three
pounds and six shillings, that you lost to me at our Anglers' Game
of Blind Hookey, which I learnt from an ingenious gentleman in
Cardiganshire.
Venator. A Welshman, Sir P
Piscator. A Welsher. I thank you; that is the amount exact to
al #. piece. Now, do you discharge our hostess, and let us forth.
I long to be doing.
Venator. O, me! It is fortunate I brought my cheque-book with
me. But, before we proceed farther, let me beg a courtesy of you:
but it must not be denied me. ...

Venator, And shall I have it too?
Piscator. You shall. I will teach you as much of this art as I am
able. Nay, more; and will, as you desire me, tell you somewhat of
the nature of most of the fish that we are to angle for. I am sure I
both can, and will, tell you more than any common Angler, being,
as you wi d me, a good fellow-traveller, full of witty conceits,
tuneful songs, and honest mirth; such a companion, indeed, as must
have his charges borne by his friend and scholar. #ut come, let us
go and catch a Chub.
Venator. Master, where will you commence to fish?
Piscator. In the river. Now I will give you some rules how to
catch a Chub.
Venator. Is not a Chub to be caught—
Piscator. In a lock 2. I thought you would say that. It is an old
conceit, as are all the known jokes about soles, plaice, John Dory,
Jack, Pike, and minnow others, I mean many others, with whic

Piscator. Let there be a seasonable time for our jests, when, after
the labour of the day, we meet at Tittlebait Tower, where f hope
to bring you in the evening. As to the Chub which we are now to
catch, note that, as you catch a Chub to dress him afterwards, so
you must first dress yourself to catch a Chub. You must, then, be
attired in a sad-coloured suit, with a hat, shoes, and veil of the same
hue, for a Chub is the fearfullest of fishes.

A SANE IDEA OF SUNDAY.
Ixºthe *: extract from a report of an address delivered on
Wednesday last week, by the ARCHRISHOP, of CANTERRURY, to a
| meeting held at the National Club, Whitehall, in aid of the Sunday
Rest Association, there will łº, be discerned by many persons,
at first sight, nothing more than thoroughly orthodox sense:-
“The Archbishop said that the report, if the statistics were accurate, showed
that good work been done during the year, for, by persuasion, 600 shops
had been wholly or partially closed, and the Sunday marketing habits of
40,000 inhabitants of the Metropolis had been changed. . The attempts at
legislation on the Sunday question had always failed, and he was sure that
persuasion on this subject would do more than legislation, for the English
people were more, easily led than driven; and if i. Was one thing more
difficult than another to drive them upon it was this Sunday question.’
Qn a moment's consideration, however, any one who is capable of
duly weighing these remarks will perceive that they express not only
sound doctrine and practical wisdom, but also a very extraordina
amount of mental power evinced in a most rare exercise of self-
control. The c of nearly all men, whatever it is, consists of
fixed ideas, which have been so imprinted on their minds as to be,
whether true or false, indelible; like the celebrated Somebody's
So-and-So Marking-Ink. It is as impossible for any man but one
much above the average of thinking men to reconsider the sectarian
doctrines which he has once been imbued with, as it is for a cat to
change its colours, or for a woman to refuse, in any one particular
of dress or ornament, how º uncleanly, unhealthy, or grotesque
soever, to follow the fashion. If this is true of Britons in general
as waii as of Continental and still more of savage or ...
races, it is, above all the 6ther British, true of those who inhabit
the north of this island. And if there is one fixed idea of doctrine
in their minds jº', more ineradicable than another, it is that
which confounds unday of Christendom with the Sabbath of
Jewry. This is an idea so fixed as to constitute what we take leave
to call the Scottish Craze. It is so inveterate that one cannot hel
thinking that it must arise from something specific in the Scottis
blood or the Scottish nervous system. Now, although ARCHIBALD
by Divine permission ARCHBIs Hop of CANTERBURY, and Primate of
all England, is the ecclesiastical head of the English Establish:
Church; nevertheless, that Most Reverend ARCHIBALD is a Scotch
man. And yet DR. TAIT speaks the language of common sense an
Christianity on the subject of Sunday !
COMBINED CHARGES.
Of course Her Majesty's Ministers usually read the Morning Pos
There are some of them who º shook their heads and sighe

—was, be it said by leave of MR. PLANCHE, the substance of obser
vations calculated to sadden Ministerial minds. Though chargin
is nowadays a less important function of the Cayalry than it ha
been, yet, urged the Post, it is at times indispensable:
“And if charging has to be done, where is the Cavalry that could exc
that which the SHAH will see to-day in Windsor Park?”
It was not, however, the charging which the SHAH would see i
Windsor Park that an economical Government must have grieved t
contemplate. No; it was the pecuniary charge of the Britis
Cavalry. Doubtless the idea of that charge, suggested by remark
on the other, affected Right Honourable Gentlemen visibly. Wh
cannot picture to himself, for instance, the effect of this suggestio
on the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER, so as to imagine MR. Low

Laurence. “Not CARE For You Now, EMILY
PURPOSE to PLEASE YOU” ”
WHY, DIDN'T I SIT FourTEEN TIMEs FoE MY PhotoGPAPH LAst WEEK, on
A “THING OF SPAIN.”
SPAIN boasts—generally—but specially boasts of imitating France.
In one matter Spain does not seem so faithful a member of the
serrum pecus as could have been expected. France, just now, is
rather particular about religious services at funerals, and a splendid
point was made last week in the Assembly, by a military man, who
asked, in trumpet voice, “If you deprive a soldier of his belief in a
future state, what right have you to ask him to throw away his
}. life?” The pious conundrum brought down the house.
But what do we read in the same paper, about Spain? “The Cortes
has voted the abolition of Military Chaplains.” This would be wise,
economically, if the Spanish Government ever paid anybody. But
considering that religion is the strong point of the Carlist assassins
who murder their prisoners, it is hard upon the poor ignorant
fellows sent against KING CHARLEs THE SEVENTH to deny them such
consolation as they could obtain from the tender services of the par-
ticularly dirty clergymen thus discharged. Moreover, though it
may not be much to the credit of the Spaniards, they always fight
best, when their priests halloo them on. However, there is only
one blunder more. Soon comes King Blunder-buss.
The Sex of the Sun.
SINCE his departure and during his absence from “the land of the
East” and “the clime of the Sun,” the SHAH has instituted a new
Order bearing the name of that luminary. The Order of the Sun is
for ladies º: The institution of this Order is a remarkable step
on the part of an Eastern potentate. It is a symbolical assertion of
the Rights of Woman, and something more. Hitherto the Sun and
Moon, tively, have been . the celestial representa-
tives of the two sexes—the Moon corresponding to the softer sex.
In creating the Order of the Sun for that Sex exclusively, the SHAH
has, to the extent of his authority, put it in the place of the other;
When he gets back will he put it in the other's habiliments? Will
he promote the inmates of the anderoon to knickerbockers?
DOVES IN A FLUTTER.
IN the course of a reply to an address lately presented to him, the
Pope, adverting to the subject of matrimony, “strongly censured
civil marriages.” A telegram to the foregoing effect adds:—
“He also repeated his declaration that there could be no alliance between
light and darkness.”
Among the Protestant ladies of England visiting Rome, with
whom it is the fashion to go to the Watican, and throw themselves
on their knees before the Pope to receive his blessing, the declara-
tion above quoted from the lips of His Holiness has probably created
some anxious sensation. Many of them, doubtless, are apprehensive
that he intended to denounce mixed *f; as such not only in
respect of creeds but also of complexions. This apprehension must
have rendered many of our fair countrywomen, blondes, in Italy very
unhappy, and may have made some of them cry.

If the CzARoviTCH, when I appear

If all these Wuzeers, and #. and Khans,
For me spend their time and their tomauns.;
Their parks and palaces lay at my feet,
Muster for me their *. and fleet,
And their miles upon miles of merchant ships;
If without the ferashes and their whips,
Manchester gathers, and Liverpool runs,
With voices of men and thunder of guns
to the light of the face of the smººn-Shah,
As unto the amber is drawn the straw ;
All this is proof in more than words,
I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords!
They told me that leaving Teheran,
anger of eating dirt Iran,—
That out of the realms of the SHAH-IN-SHAH
I should find rulers, called Light and Law.
ifay the graves of their mothers be defiled
That fain with such bosh had their SHAH beguiled!
For the more of these Feringhee Kaffirs I’ve known,
The whiter to me my face has grown.
I’ve seen the land calls the Russki lord,
And there the rulers are Stick and Sword:
In St. Petersburg, as at Ispahān,
To CzAR, as to SHAH, what is a man?
To the land of the Prusski when I came,
The tongue was changed, but the rule the same:
The stars on the coats may be sown more thick,
But the Prusski's Shah-in-Shah is Stick!
And here in the land of the Inglees
They live and move but the SHAH to please.
If my diamonds are as the sun in the skies,
What is the brightness of my eyes?
As in this land there is no sun,
They make a daylight instead of one:
The QUEEN from her palace for me retires,
To Teheran binding it with wires:
Here’s SUTHERLAND BEG makes his palace mine,
And all but bids skies for me to shine:
At the Crystal Palace, EFFENDI GROVE
With the rain itself for my pleasure strove:
And out of the water brought the fire
To compass the SHAH-IN-SHAH's desire.
In a wonderful land of wax I’ve been,
And houris fairer than Heaven have seen:
To the Inglees' Bank a visit I’ve paid
Where REUTER’s gold for me is laid:
And all that have seen me, and all I have seen,

he might, had he pleased, have .# the PADDY-SHAH), and to introduce certain alterations
in the jury-system, in order to make it possible sometimes to convict an Irish criminal.
He that the sent Government was conducted entirely according to the orders and
inspiration of the Roman Catholic Church, and therefore he proposed to declare that neither
the Popł nor any other potentate had any jurisdiction in the United Kingdom. He spoke
quite like King John ;-
“Tell this the Pope, and, from the mouth of England,
Add thus much more: That no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
But as we, under Heaven, are supreme Head,
Sounder Him, that great supremacy
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
Without the assistance of a mortal band.”
Then he contrasted Ireland with Scotland, and urged that we ought to spend money on
improving the former.

LoRD KIMBERLEY was allowed to deny that Government was a vassal of the Roman

EARL GREY suggested that the PADDY-SHAH should not be a politician, and should be the
Heir-Apparent.
Lord O'HAGAN declared that Ireland was improving in wealth and prosperity, and was as
loyal as any other part of the QUEEN’s dominions.
Ultimately the measure was put to death in a formal way. Whether the proposals were
well-timed, or were all desirable, may be questioned, but there is no question about the fact
that EARL Rºssº, a friend of Ireland in the morning of his life, continues to try to serve

MR. DISRAELI, in his best style, pulled
the Judicature Bill toº: and, paying
the Government delightful compliments on
their courageous endeavours to make it a
good measure, sweetly advised them, as
they had not been successful, to withdraw
the Bill for the present Session.
MR. GLADstone observed that MR. Dis-
RAELI had done what was most ºi

quite appreciated the bland and compli-

agreeable banter, that the suggestion, had

intimated that he had no intention of
sacrificing a measure which had received

ETIQUETTE MADE EASY.
IIIllinº º
Illº º tº
Y long experience we have been accustomed to see, appended to some of the announce-
ments under the head of “Marriages” in the Times, the excusatory notice, meant to
appease punctilious persons, "No Cards.”. In the Obituary, offence on the part of the
same class of people is usually deprecated by the request that ºriends please to
accept this intimation.”
One day, last week, however, “No Cards” appeared as an addition to an entry in the
last-named catalogue. It is quite conceivable that, in many instances, these formulas
might be interchanged between the hymeneal roll and the other with great propriety:
If there seems something melancholy in “Friends will please to accept § intimation,”
: does not marriage toº often prove to have been a truly melancholy occurrence? surely
a wedding is always such an occurrence unless the parties to it are destined to enjoy a very large and a certain income. And is not the
marriage of an opulent aunt, for instance, or uncle, never expected to wed, an occurrence in general very melancholy indeed to their
nephews, nieces, and other relatives? - - - - - - - - - -
On the other hand, when wealthy kinsfolk die unmarried, or, if widowers or widows, die childless, is not the intelligence of their
decease, if the idea of festivity be associated with cards, conveyed by the adjunct of “No Cards” in a most decorous manner?
The inventors of “No Cards” and," Friends will please accept this intimation” deserve the gratitude of their species for the relief
afforded by those substitutes for awful bores. Even Cards,” involving no composition, necessitate the use of postage stamps; and
there is one person, at least, who remembers that, in the days, of foolish etiquette, on the occasion of his marriage, such a number of
them had to §. used, in sending cards to people who expected them, that, by wetting the stamps in the ordinary manner, he and his
§: i. the day after their wedding, at last contracted such a nasty taste in their mouths that, for some considerable time, it spoiled
their honeymoon. -
There is a certain superaddition to “No Cards,” whose establishment in the column of º: would be a great boon to poor but
“respectable” humanity. It could well be started by a consistent Member of the Society of Friends—who would thereby prove himself
a true friend to his kind. “No Mourning.” . Thus would be initiated an improvement, in our manners and customs which would
constitute the repeal of a heavy social tax, and be a benefit so saving as to preclude all the distress which, in the case of all but affluent
survivors, artificial mourning adds, by reason of its expense, to genuine sorrow.

PUNCH*S CONFESSIONAL.
YEs! Hey for confession! ... But I’ve an impression
That as betwixt styles of confessing
You, my Anglican brother, have one, I've another
Idea our noddles possessing.
My confession, at least, can dispense with a priest,
And carries its own absolution:
So 'tis easier to swallow, besides beats yours hollow,
That it doesn't entail revolution.
No leave of the Bishop, or licence I'll fish up,
Nor with Jesuits, or casuists bore you;
So with this “profiteor,” say your “ confiteor,”
As Punch here shall say it before you:
“I confess, I confess, I've attempted—no less—
Via media, 'twixt two stools to settle;
Cathedra of Perer, and scamnum, whose feet are
Of neither the same make or metal:
And if 'twixt Church of Rome and of England I've come
To the fate that attends two-stool-arians,
I confess (though it hurts) I’ve got just my deserts,
For setting my brethren at variance.
I confess I’m an ass for e'er hoping a pass
To discover from England to Rome,
Without paying toll (à la Faust) of my soul
To the priest that sits under the Dome.
“I confess’tis as clear as the nose doth appear
Which I would I had had sense to follow,
No priest, howe'er clever, will get JoBN BULL ever
iſown his holy water tº swaiſow.
I confess me a donkey to fancy there's one key
To Heaven, and that kept by St. Peter;
That the priest who breeds strife betwixt husband and wife,
Is aught but a rogue and a cheater.
I confess that I trench on respect for the Bench,-
Unlit lights on the Anglican Altar !—
When I utter my hope they'll allow me more rope,
And my vestments employ as a halter l’”
THE SHAH'S OWN SHOW.
ON Wednesday last week, the SHAH visited Madame Tussaud's
Exhibition. It appears to have pl his Persian Majesty more
than anything he ever saw. The Post says:–
“We are informed that, as the SHAH was leaving Madame Tussaud's, he
made use of the following expression,-Je ne me suis jamais tant amusé.”
Perhaps it may be considered º to the SHAH to sup-
pose that he admired the works of art in the Baker Street collection
considerably more than the great majority of our specimens of
British sculpture. . By the account above quoted, the attention of
his Majesty was chiefly attracted by the waxworks which interested
. by their real excellence as portraits of illustrious persons;
and :-
“The Chamber of Horrors had not that fascination for the SHAH which it
has for many visitors.”
That, however, was only what, knowing no more of the SHAH
than that he is an absolute Qriental Sovereign, one would have
expected. The illustrations of capital and corporal punishment,
which are the gems of the Chamber of Horrors, in the eyes of a
SHAH taken to see them, can be easily understood to be as coals
carried to Newcastle.
NICE EMPLOYMENT.
IF “the recent Sugar Conference at Paris” was attended by gen-
tlemen engaged in the public service, they must now know some
thing by agreeable experience of the Sweets of Office.

Venator. On my word, Master, that is a gallant flask.
Piscator. It is; and contains choice entertainment. And you are
to note that it would be to your advantage were you to provide
yourself with one more capacious than you see me carry. you
are to note that there are several kinds of flasks of which certain hold
sufficient for the refreshment of two or three anglers. Furnish

ut for one alone.
Venator. Truly, my loving Master, I will observe your directions.
If I could take some comfort from your flask now, I think it would
save me a chill.
Piscator. Nay, Master Scholar; "º". disport yourself over the
meadow, and when you are tired I will use my rod so dexterously,
that you shall run no risk from the want of a quick circulation.
Venator. O, Master! O! Marry, I am warm throughout.
Piscator. I warrant you. But look how it begins to rain. We
will leave our lines in the river, our rods on the bank, and sit close
under this sycamore tree, where I design to eat the chicken sand-

to see me enjoying this meat P And are not the place and time well
chosen to eat it?
Venator. All excellent good, and my appetite excellent good too.
So, Master, let me fall to. You do not deny me?
Piscator. Nay, indeed, I do not denyº but it is a Christian
principle that you should deny yourself. And note, that it is my
own forethought and prudence that have armed me with this sand-
wich, for no angler should come out unprovided.
Venator. That will I not again. But now—
Piscator. It is a beautiful sandwich, made from what epicures
term the oysters of the plumpest fowls. ... You will find it mentioned
in the reckoning which you discharged with mine Hostess ere we
left this morning. So, it is finished. Now, while I smoke my pipe
of tobacco, I will proceed to my promised directions as to baiting
and angling. First, then, as to baiting a hook—
Venator. Master, is that another thing from baiting a bull?
Piscator. It is as different from it as would be baiting with a
worm, and, what a Hibernian gentleman would term, bating with a
stout oaken cudgel—as you shall soon perceive.
Venator. Nay, good Master, bear with me, and I will undertake
your charges at the next Inn we come to ; and, indeed, I would that
this rain were finished so that we might be there now.
Piscator. Now I will tell you somewhat about angling. And,
first, as to the Perch. The length of the Perch is five and a half
yards, as you .# see byE.; tables. The best time for fishing for
erch is by moonlight. Ere I proceed further, I must tell you that

A QUERY FOR COMMENTATORS.
IN an admirable review of a meritorious poem, Mr. Punch, you
refer to the virtue ascribed º SHAKSPEARE to potatoes. When he
made Falstaff say “Let the sky rain potatoes,” think you he meant
the tubers of the Solanum tuberosum # The divine WILLIAMs most
probably never ate a potato; probably knew of potatoes and their
properties only from hearsay. . The potatoes which we eat are
simply esculent. Do not the Irish rejoice in potatoes? Ireland is
no Paphos; the maids of Ireland, with the men, are potato-
fed, and they are celebrated for the pec attribute of Diana.
But the haums of the potato, and the fruit, Mr. Punch, have
other §. than those of the tubers. These qualities apparently
resemble some possessed by others of the Solanaceae. One member
of that medicinal family, the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), goes
by the alias of love-apple. Why? Perhaps by reason of a suppo-
sition like that which caused SHAKSPEARE to put the words above-
quoted into the mouth of Falstaff, when the fat Knight invoked the
tender passion,--as the Bard of all time supposed it to be understood
by QUEEN ELIZABETH.
Having weighed these considerations, most excellent Mr. Punch,
do you #. it possible that the potatoes which Falstaff wished the
sky to rain were intended to be taken as potato apples? Say, if you
like, that is a question which might be expected to *;to a
UniPrin.
P.S.–Maybe that SHARSPEARE, by potatoes, meant earth-nuts, or
earth-chestnuts, the roots of the Bunium fervosum. Is not reason

PRECAUTION FOR THE POCKET.

The fare was to be ºpenee.
At leisure, and in weather dry,
I never dream of such expense.
And when the driver set me down—
Ill-luck has ever been my curse—
I found that, bating half-a-crowa,
There were but shillings in my purse.
Of course no change the flyman had,
So I two bob was forced to pay,
Which, like old PEPys, did make me mad;

PARTIAL JUSTICE.
A BILL before the House of Commons, the Harbour
Dues (Isle of Man) Bill, affords afresh illustration of the
political * justly resented by the strong-minded
of the weaker sex. While the Rights of Man are cared
for by Parliament, even in a matter of such compara-
tively small importance as Harbour?IDues, the Legisla-
ture still refuses to recognise the Rights of Woman.
In connection with this subject it?may be noted that,
whereas the British Dominions include an Isle of Man
there is no Isle of woman in the whole of the United
Kingdom. There is, to be sure, an Isle of Wight, but,
though Wight means Person, it is at most of common

CONFESSORS AND COXCOMBS.
The REVEREND ALOYSIUs RERED0s, representing a deputation of
four hundred Clergymen of the Church of En ii. waited yester-
day on, the BISHOP of FLEET STREET at his Öfficial Palace, 85, to
sºlicit his Lordship to use his immense influence to induce Convoca-
tion to j. the Legislature to pass an Act of Parliament empow-
. t the Bishops § º $º. in order to jº. the demand
or them occasioned by the gratifying increase of the practice of
Auricular Confession in the diº. d. p
The Bishop of FLEET STREET said that every Clergyman was
officially a licensed Confessor already. Everybody also was free to
confess—if he chose. What REREnos and his party seemed to want
was that the existing licence of all the Clergy should be restricted
to the |..." of a select number.
e . MR. REREDOs did not see the matter in that light.
e Bishop supposed the only light RERenos could see by was
wax candle-ſi ht. The Church of England did not recommend the
liberty of Confession to be exercised except in exceptional cases.
He jº. RERED9s wanted to make the exception the rule, and
establish Auricular Confession as it prevails in Popery. He that
exception tºok for rule, would in the mirror see a fool. Whence
was Auricular Confession derived 2
MR. REREDos said from Catholic antiquity.
. The Bishop of FLEET STREET said that doctors differed about
Catholic antiquity; and who should decide if not the Pope? RERE-
Dos had much better go to Rome. What did the word “Auricular”
come -
The Rev. MR. REREDos knew that. From Auricula, a little ear.
The Bishop.–Why a little ear? Why little?
RERED0s.—My Lord, I don't know.
The Bishop.–You are an ignoramus; and, I have a great mind
to pluck you by the ear. Auricula, as regards the Confessional, is
a little ear by comparison. The ears of the Priest are short com-
pared with those of the Penitent. Popery takes care that the former
shall be no donkey. That, at least, is the Protestant view. As for
you, however, who want to play at Popery without the Pope, and
whose Confessional, according to the Pope, is good-for-nothing,
there is no disparity of ears in the Confessional on either side.
MR. REREDos said his Lordship was disposed to be pleasant.
The Bishop replied that he wasn't, and told REREDOs not to use
wººin a non-natural sense. Did he (REREDOs) believe in Develop-
ment :
The REv. MR. RERED0s.—DR. NEWMAN's?
The Bishop.–No. MR. DARwLN's. Because (continued his Lord-
ship) the simiousness of Anglican mock-Papists made him blush for
their common origin, as to which he feared DARWIN must be right.
Protestant monks, anyhow, might well be thought to have descended
from monkeys. ropos of monks, there was one Romish rite
which he ; t might be º practised in the Esta-
blished Church. The tonsure would be a capital thing for hot-
headed Clergymen—especially in the Dog-days. He (the º
would willingly undertake to confer that distinction on would-be
Father Confessors. If he (REREDos) pleased, he (the Bishop) would
send instantly to HoNEY AND SKEITON's for a duly qualified assistant
by whom the tonsure would be administered on the spot.
The Rev. MR. REREDos would not accept the offer at present, but
thanked his Lordship as much as if he did, and withdrew.

QN the part of the Parsee residents in London, and the Parsees of
India, memorials have been presented to the SHAH, beseeching his
Majesty to redress the grievances to which their co-religionists are
subject in Persia, where their religion, like another in another coun-
try; was once that of the State. The creed of Parsees is commonly
spoken of as the religion of ZoroastER, its founder; and many a
riton, who pronounces ZoroastER in a British manner, will discern
a curious coincidence between ZoroastER's name and his religion in
the circumstance that the distinctive feature of that religion is, if
not exactly the worship, at least the high veneration of fire. It does
not appear, however, that the disciples of ZoroastER were what,
compounding a hybrid word, we may call Zoo-roasters...Theirs was
not the religion which signalised itself by roasting heretics alive.

HYDROPHOBLA INSURANCE.
WHAT a º is that the Government have given a merely local application
to their grand discovery that hydrophobia is preventible by preventing ".
going into the water! To be sure the Dog-days continue to be so named because
we now know that dogs go mad in them less frequently than anywhen else;
but still a few cases of canine rabies may occur for want of, whereas they
might have been assuredly precluded by, sufficient precaution. At present the
ºnly sure precaution taken against that horrid disease is limited to the Parks.
There, indeed, it is rigidly enforced by the Police, who are empowered to
restrict the liberty of ogs and their masters with a high hand, if they are
instructed to let demagogues, supported by mobs, spout sedition unmolested.
But nº steps whatsoever have been taken to prevent persons from sending
their dogs into the Thames, and there dog go in and swim away without re-
straint, how hot soever the weather is. Even the Thames, though, is only a
partial tract of water, whence the exclusion of dogs could onl hinder the
generation of hydrophobia to a corresponding extent, Totally and entirely to
accomplish that important purpose, it is necessary that official notices should
be º: all over the United Kingdom warning all owners of dogs never to
wash them, and not to let them go into the water ever at all; and, moreover,
to make these measures the more certainly efficacious in j dogs from
i. mad, it might be as well to append to them a recommendation to let no
og have any water to drink. At present, to be sure, any admonition to the
§§ effect would be merely hortatory; but, before the end of the Session,
in thin Houses, when none but Ministerial Members attend, and they attend to
.# but Ministerial designs, it would be easy to push a short Bill through
each House of Parliament to deprive dogs of access to water; imposing penalties
for disobedience to its provisions, for the observance of which to issue an edict
instantly would doubtless be to MR. AYRTON, if authorised, a labour of love.

FINAL CAUSE OF A FIRE.
HERE is a cutting from a newspaper:-
“ALEXANDRA PALACE.-The Gardeners' Magazine proposes
that the ruins of the Palace on Muswell Hill should be #".
served, and that another site within the grounds should be
selected for the new building it is intended to erect. Our horti-
cultural contemporary appears to regard the ruins as provi-
dentially provided for a display of ivies and other climbing plants
proper to ruins and historical sites.”
Assent to the idea of a special providence, as proposed
by Hamlet, is consistent with scepticism as to that of a
particular instance of #. º imagined by
some one else. Ivies and climbing plants, by pre-arrange-
ments of creation, spring upon ruins; but that certain
ruins have been “providentially provided” by a cala-
mitous fire to accommodate future creepers is open to
doubt. If they are allowed to stand for that purpose
assurance should first have been obtained, from a carefui
survey, that they º trusted for standing., Qr else,
one of these days, when the People are wandering, or
icnicking, or dancing among the ivy-clad ruins on the
#. site of the Alexandra Palace, the ivy-clad
ruins will perhaps tumble down upon the People's eads,
and somebody will then take occasion to say that “for
this among the rest were they ordained.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. [July 19, 1873.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
º
|iº |
S
ENsiveLY Mr. Punch watched the
A SHAH take his departure on Sa-
turday, July 5. en the former
looked into a º: to see
what had occurred in Parliament
on the previous night, when low-
ness of spirits at parting with
his #º NAssR-ED-DIN pre-
vented Mr. Punch from doing
anything but drink, well-iced
Cup, sub tegmine fagi. He did
not find that he had lost much by
indulging in manly sorrow, ...
LoRD REDESDALE moved an Address for the creation of certain, Legal Life
Peerages in favour of high officials. LoRD SALISBURY made an able speech in
its favour, and declared that the House of Lords, within its own walls, was the
most Democratic Assembly in the world, being full of men who had won their
way by their own abilities. But he complained that the Lords by no means
attended sufficiently to their duties. LoRD GRANVILLE opposed the Motion, and
it was rejected.
The Judicature Bill made progress in the Commons, and young gentlemen of
the legal persuasion may like to know that there are to be “modifications” of
the Long Vacation, at the discretion of the Judges. It may not in the future
be§: so easy to get away to raffle at Margate or to flirt at Tyde.
R. PLUNKETT moved a lution to the effect that Irish Civil Servants are
insufficiently paid, and ought to have the same reward of labour as their English
brethren, and though MR. GLADstoNE and MR, Lowe made vehement fight
against the Motion, the Government was beaten by 130 to 117.
MR. WHALLEY tried for upwards of three-quarters of an hour to bring on a
Tichborne Motion, and being twice informed by the SPEAKER that he was out of
order, the M.P. for Peterborough talked about a “Reign of Terror.” His fears
of this appear slightly superfluous, as during that Reign the only persons in
º had heads. Persevering, MR. WHALLEY was told that the SPEAKER
would have to take the sense of the House on his conduct, whereon he expressed
his regret that his feelings had overcome his judgment. Well, that contest
was unequal.
Monday-LoRD SHAFTESBURY promoted a Bill for putting down “dummy”
Charitable Societies, which are really swindles. He says that the benevolent
but silly public are cheated out of £400,000 a year by the concocters of these
frauds. The provisions, however, which Lord SHAFTESBURY proposed to make
were so stringent, that the LoRD CHANCELLoR declared that if the Bill passed
*...'. in his senses would have anything to do with any charitable institution.
LoRD SAEISBURY said that if fools could not be protected except at the expense of
innocent and charitable folks, fools should go without protection. The Bill was
withdrawn. We doubt whether ºf ois” would be at figrateful for it. There
is a large class that believes itself charitable, but is only yain and pig-headed,
which chooses to dispose of its sham-charity in every way, but that approved by
the rational. Between the she-fool who chucks a shilling to a #. organ-
grinder down to the he-fool who sends a five-pound note in answer to a canting
advertisement, there is a mass of propertied idiotism which qught to be dealt
with by the criminal law, rather than protected by wise and ºil. persons like
LoRD SHAFTESBURY.
i.W. º TrCHBoRNE again. “An ironical cheer.” Peterborough ought to
very proud.
MR. G.ADston E, appealed to by LoRD SANDoN on the subject of Mr. Punch's
Cartoon of the Primates, admitted that the principle of protecting the Church
against the innovations and ceremonials introdu by priests was a sound one,
but that the subject was one for the Ecclesiastical Courts. This was not a
Gladstonian answer, but rather one that might have
been made by the pococurante GALLIo.
The PREMIER then massacred a few Innocents. Among
the list was the Public Prosecutors Bill, which is more
valuable than any other Government measure except the
Judicature Bill.
On the Motion of MR. WHARTON, a whipping was added
to the punishment ordained by a new Bill in case of
certain wicked outrages on the helpless. The lash was
carried by 39 to 25, but MR. PETERTAYLOR announced
that he should try to get the decision reversed. We
should like this done as the CHANCELLOR, in TITUs
OATES days, wished the sentence that doomed that mis-
oreant to be flogged from prison to Westminster reversed
—namely, that the offender should also be flogged “back
d ga in .”
Tuesday.—Mischief in the wind. LoRD CAIRNs (was
he acting on a hint from the Leader of Opposition else-.
where?) had discovered from BLACKSTONE that the Com-
mons had committed a breach of the Lords' privileges,
and from his own sagacity that they had violated the
Acts of Union with Scotland and Ireland. The point is
that by the Judicature Bill, as sent down from the Peers,
the Appellate, Jurisdiction, abolished, for England, was
retained for the two Fº kingdoms (we hope that
is ul enough), but Government, on consideration,
- uced a generi abolition. This LORD CAIRNs re-
In
8. in the grave light above described. The LoRD
HANGELLOR said that the matter should receive all at-
tention, but he earnestly hoped that if the Lords had an
such ri as were suggested they would be waived,
rather endanger so valuable a measure. He, how-
ever, contended that there was no ground for the com-
F. It remains to be seen whether the §. will
e patriotic enough to resist the pleasure of wing out
the best Bill of the Session.
WHALLEY on TICHBoRNE again. “Murmurs.” Peter-
borough ought to be very proud.
MR. H. fº did then astonish himself and the
world by defeating the Government. He mºved an
address in favour of a system of International Arbitra-
tion. He said all the highly true and proper things
about the wickedness of war, of which he declared that
nations were weary. They are nothing of the kind.
“War's a game that, were their subjects wise,
Kings would not play at.”
MR. GLADston E made a very sensible speech in reply,
and did not see that European opinion on the subject
was sufficiently advanced.
SIR WILFRID LAwson wondered what the SHAH
thought of us. We had shown him everything of a fight-
ing sort, but had not taken him to church:to hear that
our religion bade us love our enemies, and if we had, he
would not have believed it. A very good clap-trap for
the houses so much hated by SIR WILFRID, but hardly
worthy of the House of Commons. But, on division-
what the Members of the Government and the Whips
were about we should like to know—the Ministry were
beaten by 98 to 88. “Nice management,” we dare say
that MR. SPEAKER privately remarked to the Maoe, per-
haps adding, “I never made these blunders.”
Wednesday.—In the Commons two things were done.
The Commons, by 140 to 83, threw out a Bill for
hibiting the Sale of Liquor, in Ireland, on Sunday.
LoRD HARTINGTON, in opposing it for the Government,
said, fairly enough, that the constant repetition of such
attacks on a certain trade went some way to justify the
“aggressive self-defence” of our friend, Bung. MR:
Britisford Hope, by an effort of gratory, “talked out.”
the Bill for allowing people to be buried in Churchyards
with almost any kind of service their friends might
think proper to perform. The Bill itself is buried, but
MR. O. MoRGAN, its parent, thinks he may write Resur-
gam on the tombstone, and that Mr. Disnºr's magic
spells may one day revive the defunct.
Thursday.—Something in the Lords about the cost
of salutes to the SHAH. LoRD CARNARwon had heard
that each cost £1000., Lond CAMPERIowN (descendant
of the glorious Admiral first named in the lines
“All for the Land-Service,
Forgetting DUNCAN, NELson, Howe, and JERVIs,”)
said that Pebble Powder had been used, which, if we
made it, cost £33s. 5d. a barrel, and if we bought it of

contractors, £4 15s. Do not; these contractors want somethin
unpleasant done to —blowing away from guns, or some suc
gentle hint about profits?
On the Judicature MR. GLADSTONE very elaborately defended
Bi
the course which he ; taken in regard to the Irish and Scotch
#. question. But he thought it respectful to the Lords, who
had behaved so well about the rest of the Bill, to make things easy
for them, and he proposed to retain the words which completed the
jurisdiction of the new Court, but not those which extinguished the
rds' jurisdiction. Then the Lords would find a Court ready made
for the three kingdoms, but nothing to impair their own privileges.
The device seems neat, and if the purpose be effected, what matter
how circumbendibustically it is done. We regret to say that MR.
DISRAELI begged for time to digest the “queer propositions” of the
Government. We went into Committee on other parts of the Bill.
In the course of the debate MR. CAVENDISH BENTINCR said that he
i. i*be jº: to which º:#".La replied
that nobody su was, “especi inner. ughter.
But we should #. preferred to hear Weeping, considering what was
implied in SIR John CoIERIDGE's “suckasm.”
Friday—Lond HALIFAx stated that Government, intended to
. our defensive works at Alderney. At present they have cost
only a Million and a Half, Madam. They will be useful, it seems,
for “watching Cherbourg’’ when we goto war with France.
In the Commons there was a Scene, You know, Madam, that if
any Member calls the SPEAKER's attention to the fact that there are
Strangers in the House, he must turn them out. M.R. MITCHELL
HENRY did this, and the Reporters were excluded. Hahf-a-dozen
pencils, of course, were instantly ready to take notes for the news-
papers, and just as satisfactory a report appeared in every journal
as if MR. HENRY had abstained from his absurd act. His alleged
reason was that the papers did not report the Irish speeches with the
fulness the speakers desired.
MR. Bouver IE warned MR. HENRY that such capricious exercise
wer would lead to its being taken away, and MR. GLADSTONE
something of the same kind to hint.
Of course the “folly's crown of folly” was woven by MR. WHAL-
LEY, who declared that he was very scantily reported because three-
fourths of the flººn in the gallery were Roman Catholics.
From anybody but MR. WHALLEY, the imputation involved here
would be an insult. Now, of course that is out of the question. But
if the gentlemen, in the gallery were really his enemies, they would
lose no opportunity of recording his utterances. He was rebuked
by the SPEAKER for the line he took. Peterborough ought to be
very proud.
After this the reporters were re-admitted. In the O'Keeffe case,
. GLADsroNE virtually #. a victory to MR. Bouver IE. We
went through a good deal of business. -
Lastly, WHALLEY again on TICHBoRNE. He complained of the
roceedings for contempt of court. MR. BRUCE had hoped that
HALLEY, having relieved his mind, would not again have troubled
the House. MR. BRUCE is a sanguine person. He added that it was
the offensive language used by the friends of the defendant that had
got them into trouble.
WHALLEY up again, but up sprang another Member, and got him
“Counted Out.” Peterborough ought to be very proud.

ANGLO-SAXON DIGNITY.
THE Paris correspondent of a contemporary represents the SHAH
as ºn: for one thing in that capital, the º of not being
mobbed. "This expression implies a comparison which is odious to a
Briton who sym ises with the masses of his fellow-countrymen,
It is true that whenever they could get at the SHAH they pressed
upon him in their thousands, and º: the gratification of a noble
sentiment in trying to touch him bodily, insomuch that they made
His Majesty smile to witness the enthusiastic veneration excited by
contiguity to a despot in the minds of the free. But this physical
manifestation of delicate respect towards the SHAH should be called
thronging, not mobbing him. Of course he has had no such polite
attention paid him in Paris. And perhaps, how flattering soever it
would have been to his higher nature, he did, in a sense, enjoy
exemption from it in the hot weather.
We are also told that the SHAH, who has the newspapers read to
him occasionally, expresses his surprise at the trivial details
recorded about himself and his movements. The journals referred
to in this statement are, of course, the British. There are none
other in * the bulk of whose readers have humility enough not
to despise such small matters. In the United States, however, the
SHAH, if he went thither, would be surrounded, watched, and inter-
viewed, and reported with a degree of minuteness evincing, even
more than any similar manifestations have shown in England, how
profoundly the majority of individuals constituting a great people
are impressed with a sense of their own littleness.
CONJURORS AND NO CONJURORS.
ERTAIN conjurors, illusion-
ists of great ingenuity, are

mena exhibited by, these
gentlemen are real appear-
ances. They are p d
by "...i. but they
are produced: with the
help of apparatus. Are
the spiritualist phenomena,
so-called, produced at all?
For those who think they
witnessed them do seem, at
any rate, to have ascer-
tained that no apparatus
was employed to produce
them. en of science be-
lieve them to be either
fictitious or subjective;
their narrators either hav-
ing been seized with hallu-
cinations, or telling lies.
To give imitations, then,
- of those pretended pheno-
mena, how Glever soever, is not a clever way to prove Spiritualism
humbug. What is there to imitate?
PREACHEE PREACHEE.
IT is too true that the affairs of nations, other than our own, are
not regulated by amiable sentiments. There is more than enough
reason to fear that, while human nature continues to be human
nature, all other people than ourselves are likely to be . by
their blind and bruti passions, uncontrolled, and ungovernable, by
considerations of reason and justice. So long as they remain subject
to the frailties which they share with the gorilla, the tiger, the
hyaena, and other ferocious beasts, that is to say, so long as the
world endures, it will be idle to invite them, as MR. RICHARD pro-
poses, to settle their *.*. by arbitration instead of war. It is
sentimental folly to think that a merely verbal appeal to the better
feelings of mankind, Her Majesty's subjects excepted, will ever
succeed in elevating those feelings, or rather the rudiments of them,
to any degree of predominance over the animal propensities. But,
mind, except the exception, namely, Her Majesty's subjects. . For
if you announce, as aº universally true, that there is no
use in preaching to reform and convert offenders, evilly disposed, the
subscription-payer will, if he believes you, immediately, cry, No
more missionaries!” and the Church-goer will likewise shout, “No
more sermons!” Unless, indeed, the f. regards the utility of a
sermon as consisting, not in any possible reformatory effect it is
absurdly credited with, but in supplying a deficiency which, without
it, might justly be objected to by adversaries to Protestant discipline.
For, unless in the case, here and there, of an instructive and inter-
esting discourse, something else than a string of cant and platitudes,
do not sermons constitute the penance of the Protestant Church F
PROJECTILES AND POWDER.
SUPPOSE that, sixty, or seventy years ago, some one gi with
clairvoyance in a newspaper of the present , meta:
hysically, expanded to his prophetic vision, that a question had
E. asked in the House of Lords about firing a salute in honour of
the SHAH with pebble powder. - -
Not endowed with the faculty of interpretation as well as that of
E. that clairvoyant may be conceived to have been puzzled
y the statement which he may be imagined to have foreseen.
The presence of the SHAH in this country would probably have
struck #. as a fact not clearly intelligible. Wiewing the future as
the past, he would perhaps have conjectured that the SHAH had
involved himself in a war with the East India Company, #: cap-
tured by the British troops, and conveyed to England. But then
what to make out of firing a salute in honour of the SHAH, must
have perplexed him. Would a salute befired in honour of a prisoner
of war?" And then how could a salute be fired with pebble powder?
Pebbles might be made into gun-flints, but by what means could
gunpowder be made out of them? Per . the clairvoyant would
ultimately have taken refuge in the conclusion that the SHAH had
been saluted by the populace with a volley of pebbles.

[July 19, 1873.
A SURREPTITIOUS WHIFF.
SALWATION FOR SHIPPING.
UNDER the heading of “Baptism of a Ship,” the Times, one day
last week, contained some account of “a singular mediaeval cere-
mony,” which “was revived by the christening of a newly launched
vessel, in the neighbourhood of Greenwich.” The vessel was the
Tolten, built by order of the Chilian Government; baptist the REy.
MR. O'HALLoRAN, a Priest of St. Mary's, Greenwich; sponsors for
the ship “a MR. Aves,” and “a young lady of Chilian parent-
age” :—
“Instead of breaking a bottle of wine against the bows of the vessel, as is
the usual custom among us, MR. O'HALLoRAN went round the upper and
main decks, º: by a body of acolytes, and choristers, who sang, the
Benedictus, while the priest sprinkled the timbers of the good ship with holy
water, in the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, and the “baptism was
complete.’”
The baptism of a ship is, we see, performed by aspersion.
Immersion, of course, wº not do; ºf do the reverse of the
desired good. Indeed, the object of the aspersion is to avert the
immersion.
It is to be wished that the custom of baptising ships were general
in the case of vessels built for Roman §. c owners, public or
private. Instructive inferences might then be drawn from the
comparative losses of baptised, and unbaptised shipping. The
baptism of a vessel would plainly appear to be of great use, or of
little, or none. Accordingly, either faith would be vindicated and
Co. ed, or superstition exploded; and it is a wonder that con-
fidence in the former of those two possible results has not long ago
been evinced in a Papal Bull imposing the obligation to have all
their vessels baptised on the faithful.
It is not, however, easy to see the necessity for godfathers and
godmothers in the baptism of ships. What can they promise and
vow? The ships have no evil works to renounce, and a MR. Aves
and a young .# of Chilian parentage, for example, can obyiously
not answer for the behaviour of the Tolten in a storm. Neither,
unless at least one of the sponsors of a vessel is a principal owner,
will her godfathers and mothers be able to take care that she is
ed with cargo, or sent afloat in an unsea-
not dangerously overl
worthy condition and heavily ins , to the intent that the loss of
passengers and crew only, with clear gain to surviving proprietors,
shall be the sole result of her going to the bottom. To be an
efficient godfather to a ship her sponsor should combine the character
of MR. PLIMsoll with the position of the gentlemen who accuse
him of libel.
SUPERLATIVE SAWEALL.

the very opposite of that which the author of the New Magdalen
may be º: as wishing to inculcate.
Both play and novel are undoubtedly clever, especially the play:
indeed, their cleverness is but an aggravation. here, ana-
iogous , is the difference between the late Eugene Aram, which
the tender-hearted º: has prevailed on MR. IRVING not
to play any longer, and this New Magdalen.
he former was, morally and dramatically, bad; the latter, has
the first mentioned defect, but, excepting the finish, is throughout
dramatically excellent.
But, at best, who and what are the hero and heroine?. A priggish
parson, who succumbs to the first impulse of an undignified passion,
and an unprincipled adventuress, who only speaks truth when a lie
will no longer serve her, and whose superficial, penitence would
cause Angels to weep rather than rejoice. And it is this woman who
marries the parson, and whom the author has called the New Mag-
dalen / A very new style of Magdalen indeed!
There’s just one thing about Mercy Merrick and the Curate—
they're uncommonly well matched. When the curtain falls on the
union of this charming pair—“so justly formed to meet by nature”
—one feels that, after a year or two, Mercy Merrick, the false
penitent, will lead that Pecksniffian young clergyman such a life, as
would move his neighbours to pity, were it not for Society's p.
correct verdict of “Serve him right:” for he had literally courte
his Fate, and now he must #". with her as best he can.
But, when you come to think of it, as Your Representative went
and came to think of it, what a prig that ecclesiastic is... Let those
who know the New Magdalen in novel, or play, mark this. That
wonderful preacher, Mr. Julian Gray, had a very limited repertoire
of discourses. º conviction is that he had oni one, and preached
it everywhere, and on every possible occasion. ercy Merrick first
heard this sermon—(I wonder whether it was his originally? I
don't believe it was, myself, but no matter)—at the Refuge. When
she meets him again, and when ceasing to eat pâté de #: gras, and
talk chit-chat "... of a priggish and egotistic c arººter), he
suddenly deems it necessary to speak professionally,–what happens?
Why, she recognises the very words she heard, years * in that
sermon at the Refuge. He’d learnt it by heart, and preached
extempore. -
The author makes his pet parson give his own version of why he
was chasséd from his country cures. Julian tells of his having
sided with the poor, starved employed, against the bloated, grinding-
down employers; and that, therefore, the parishes where
ministerofºil become too hot to hold him—though, as Father
O'Leary told the Protestant Bishop, who denied the existence of
Purgatory, “he might have gone farther and fared worse”-and he
8ir, or my taste, but we A
second.
. The true history of the Rev. Julian Gray (however he may have
imposed himself on MR. WILKIE Collins) is that of a Clergyman
with one sermon. He went into the country, and on the first Sunday
the parishioners exclaimed, “Lovely!” iſery Merricks were in
tears all over the place, and there was no end to the dinner invita-
tions. Next Sunday the congregation thought they’d heard what
he was preaching to them before. The third Sunday they were
certain of it, and complained to him. The fourth Sunday they com-
plained of him to the Bishop; and the fifth Sunday, when, after
cunningly beginning with a different text, he commenced precisel
the same discourse as they had been hearing for more than a mont
of Sundays, my belief is that the infuriated congregation rose en
masse, and chevied him across country out of that parish, the next,
and the one after that. This happened wherever he went, and then
he returned to town, took odd-jobs (where the sermon came in capi-
tally) on sharing terms of half after the first two-and-sixpence in
**. and made averytidy income.

e up to
ad Mercy been made to refuse this impulsive ecclesiastic, whose
haste and warmth are most unseemly, and to devote herself to a
life of penitential works of charity and mercy, the end would have
been worthy of the beginning, where we saw her tending the
wounded with the red, cross on her arm. But that these two—the
unctuous, * , undergraduate kind of Curate, with his one
sermon on º: and the superficially penitent Refugee –
should, at the fail of the curtain be left hugging one another,
and settling where good, places are to be reserved for them in
Heaven, is a g finish to one of the most cleverly drama-
tised stories that has for some time appeared on the London Stage.
By the way, I am not more fastidious than Your Representative
should be, but I take leave to say that there is something worse
than bad tastein the Olympic placards, which seek to attract atten-
tion to this play by 5. a reference to a text from St. Luke.
What is MR. DoNNE about? And I wonder who could have told a
theatrical advertisement-maker anything about St. Luke.

The SHAH played old gooseberry with all, the Shows; and the

self-congratulation on his departure.
Before concluding, I will recount what I saw a week or so back,
and what the SHAH didn't see. In the neighbourhood of Russell
Square, I heard a band *..."; It was on a cart. There
was a huge drum: also several brass instruments, all played
energetically by men in a sort of whitey-brown-holland uniform,
turned up with blue. Following this last, came seven or eight other
carts, with more men in uniforms, and filled (the carts, not the men)
with large milk-cans. On the earts were the words, “The Express
Country Milk Company”—or some such title—implying that the
Company guarantee to bring milk from the country, express to
London. The train that brought this quantity of milk may have
been express; the carts weren't, for they were going at a processional
walk, in order to allow the drumming and trumpeting to be done
comfortably. But what a way to bring milk to town'. I wonder if
the Express Milk Company does this every day, or if this was only an
exceptional occasion. What a poetic halo would be thrown around,
and in some instances what grandeur would accompany, our pro-
visions, were they all thus brought to our doors!" Bakers' and
butchers' processions in the morning with bassoons and 9 hieleides;
grocers with violoncellos; and fishmongers, with harps. e subject

PUNCH*S WHISPERING GALLERY.
It is no secret that the brilliant success at croquet of one of the
best known and most ºl. Prelates on the Bench, at many of the
recent lawn parties, has been the theme of universal admiration.
Now that the season is drawing to a close, rumour is busy with
the names of several members of the haut ton who are about to con-
tract distinguished alliances. A list of these engagements in high
life will shortly be published in the London Gazette. Autumn
* at watering-places, country houses, &c., will go on as
usual.
There will be no match this year at Wimbledon between the
Philosophers and Poets.
It cannot possibly be construed into a contempt of Court, or breach
of privilege, to publish that the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE is sea-bathing,
MR. JUSTICE MELLOR fishing, and MR; JUSTICE, LUSH lying on his
back on the grass, gazing at the blue sky, and doing nothing. The
Jury, who are inseparable, have been enjoying some pic-nics.
MR. HAwKINs is haymaking.
The fireworks at the approaching coronation of the KING of THE
SANDwich IslanDs, and the forthcoming celebration of the silver
wedding of the GRAND LLAMA of THIBET, will be of assing
º and supplied by English pyrotechnists of the highest
celebrity.
Daily telegrams as to the health and condition of the Grouse are
now received and posted at both Houses of Parliament.
Great preparations are already being made for the next meet-
ing of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
(and prices). It is in contemplation to whitewash some of the prin-
cipal ceilings both in shops and private dwelling-houses; and it is
hoped that a sufficient quantity of philosopher's stone will be avail-
able to repave one or more of the principal thoroughfares.
There will be no Ministerial fish-dinner again this year, but the
Cabinet will take some refreshment together at their last conference
before the Recess. Only one toast will be proposed—“To our next
merry meeting.”
The project of a Penny Subscription for gilding the exterior of
the dome of St. Paul's is warmly taken up by the leading Bankers,
Merchants, and Traders of the City of London.
There is no foundation for the report that the Board of Trade
have instructed the Town Clerks and Clerks of the Peace through-
out the country to collect statistics as to the number of caged birds
kept in England and Wales, with a view to future taxation.
t is understood that the attention of Convocation will shortly be

A Petition, signed by 94,615 single ladies, is about to be presented
to the Archbishops and Bishops of both provinces, praying them
whatever other Romish practices they may suffer to pass unchecked
in their dioceses, that they will sternly repress any attempt to
revive celibacy amongst the Clergy.
There is a rumour of further retrenchments in the Civil Service.

translate this to the SHAH.

PHILOSOPHICAL BALL.
A GERMAN Professor has been giving a ball, “to

tween the famous Greek philosopher and quadrilles and
galops is not strikingly apparent, and, so far as we are
aware, no commentator or scholiast" has started the
theory that PLATO's Academy was a Dancing Academy.
But a dance in his honour was better than a dinner
with toasts and speeches, and we hope the Platonists
of both sexes enjoyed the evening, and that no such
dangerous thing as a Platonic attachment was origi-
nated in the room.
It is understood that the admirers of ARISTOTLE,
determined not to be behindhand, have held a meeting
to consider the most suitable way of commemorating the
birthday of their great sage and master. It seems likely
that an open-air fete, concluding with a grand display
of fireworks in the evening, will be the programme
of the Committee. Other commemorations are spoken
of-EUCLID, PYTHAgoRAs, SoLoN, &c. Further par-
ticulars will be duly announced.
A Clerical Example.
A SERIES of charges against a clergyman in the Diocese
of Chester having been investigated by the Bishop at
Wigan, the defendant, convicted of “certain charges

for three years and condemned in costs. Thus it appears
that a Bishop of the Established Church is quite able to
deal decidedly with Ritualists, if he pleases. , Here is
a Ritualist whose peculiar idolatry consists in celebrating
the rites of Bacchus. This one is not allowed to con-
tinue at the same time his orgies and his ministrations.

A NOBLE FAILURE.
EveRY true Liberal will commiserate a generous Government for
the peculiarly bitter mortification it has experienced in the Guild-
ford County Court. Before that tribunal, JAMES GREEN, twelve
years a Warder at Woking Prison, of irreproachable moral character
indeed, but guilty of serious illness, and, because thereby incapaci-
tated, having been dismissed without a day's notice, or a day's pay,
sued the Directors of Her Majesty's Prisons for wages due durin
his illness. With characteristic magnanimity this suit was resisted,
not on its merits, but, by the help of the Law Officers of the Crown,
with a series of ingenious quibbles. Alas, however, judgment was
pronounced in favour of the F. for one month and t days'
pay, the costs of attorney and plaintiff two days, and the plaintiff's
witnesses one whole day! the costs and damages thus inc
will have to beČ. out of the national Exchequer; and, therefore,
Her Majesty's Government will not only not have succeeded in the
endeavour to save the º some §i. s, if not pounds, by the
technical evasion of an ex-official's demand for his just wages, but
they will have let in the nation for the additional expense of the
costs incurred in that great attempt wherein they have had the
glorious but sad misfortune to fail. Are they not, feelingly, deeply,
to be pitied ?

MR. DISRAELI made one of his smartest
speeches thereon, and certainly pointed out
some inaccuracies in the historical state-

before, justified the course he had taken.
He objected to MR. GLADSTONE's impolite-

in the privileges of the Commons, but he

However, that is a detail. Mr. Punch heartily co tulates him,
and the 1st Edinburgh, and Auld Reekie, and Caledonia stern
wild, upon the victory. It was won by a sort of accident—that i

too, loyal and open-hearted a Party to think of trying to explain

One word more. Hearty congratulations to all who were in the
great tent on Sunday, that they were out of it before the storm blew
it down. But is there not something out of taste in this Wimbledon
Church business? Does not the Service seem rather like part of the
Pic-Nic? If it were only for the Volunteers it would be most proper,
but how many of the 2000 in that tent were Volunteers? en, as
to the mode of celebration. Have our readers seen a French regi-
ment at religious duties—drawn up in the open air, on three sides,
with the modest altar on the fourth?. That is, to our eye, more like
what is fitting, than a holiday crowd in a tent.
Leaving this to the consideration of those concerned, we have
nothing to add but congratulations to the Volunteers, and to their
Lady and Mistress, on the capital muster and magnificent marks-
manship of 1873, when

with your hand in the river, as Ibid you, while I consult book
of conceits and ballads, so that I may be even with brother
and his companion to-night.

time, with the help of the water, will rust the hook, and so it will
gently wear away. And now, while he hath hold of you thus, I
will sit down at ease, and tell something more about the Pike, The
learned Gosing observes, that a maid in T was swallowed

But that would be uneven.
If upon a bank he lies
For two hours, then he dies.
Mourn the birds, and weeps the shrike,
All the fishes go on strike
At the death of Old King Pike.
Also my friend, MR. WAGSTAFF, affirms that the gaiters of two
Polonian gentlemen, who disappeared about the same time and
place, were found near a pond on a high road, where *...
used to be a well-known which had been knownto stop 8,
cattle, carts, and everything that came its way. The venerable
Bishop StoßtroRD relates how he used to catch these voracious
monsters, after dark, by fastening himself to bladders and floating
down the stream with a reading-lamp fixed to his girdle, and a
ing-book in his hand. Sometimes he earried bottles of hay, and
the flags of the various countries, through which he floated. There
are no pikes in Spain, and the roads are in a very bad state.
- Venator. Would I were in Spain. Master! O!
Piscator. So! Take him in his leap !—You have him. I tell you,
Scholar, fishing and catching are two separate arts.
Wenator. O me! I am content. Shall we eat him, Master?
Piscator. Nay, that will we not. Honest brother PETER and his
companion will bring a fine salmon trout with them, so we shall net
want for fish. But see! there in the meadow are two simple milk-
maids ºf the sheep. We will speak them so fairly, that they
shall be glad to give us a leg of young lamb in exchange for our
Pike. So do you carry the fish, cans, nets, and tackle, while I hold
the rod, and will presently address these maidens.
Venator. O, Master, the more buxom of the pair would be a fit
hº for an angler!
'scator. Why so?
Penator. She is so Chubby. O, Master! I will never again make
so sorry a jest! O! O! O!
MARTIAL ORGANISATION.
LoRD Eromo is reported to have told the House of Commons that
the physique and age of our soldiers enlisted of late years are lament-
ably below the standard held to be essential in Germany. If this is
so, what wonder? Where military service is compulsory the State
can pick and choose recruits, and chooses grenadiers accordingly.
“Of all the gallant heroes,” sings our anonymous quasi TYRTEUs,
“there’s none for to compare (with a ri-tol-de-riddle-iddle-lol) to
the British Grenadier.” But now it appears that, in a general way,
the German Grenadier does, in stature at least, without jº:
cation in our TYRTAEUS's iyric, excel the British. On the other
hand, however, let it be considered that, in these days of rifle-
shooting with precision, the soldier's stature is of less importance
than it was; and that, if our recruits are short, they are voluntary,
and bear great minds in little bodies—the latter, nevertheless, quite
big enough to serve the former efficiently in drawing the “bead”
and the trigger. But there is another greatness of mind often
actuating a great body, Bodies and brains are not always commen-
surate, but great brains do in many cases go with great bodies, and
generally great minds with generally great brains, and then great-
ness of mind is intellectual as well as impulsive. Thus a greatness
of brains is apt to be accompanied by a great mind, amounting to a
strong determination, to take every possible care never to put the
brains in the way of being blown out. Hence, whilst little men
with little brains enlist willingly in the army of their country, or any
other, great men, with great rains, too many of them, require
coercion to make them soldiers.

PEACE IN SALEM.
. SALEM means “Peace.”. Jerusalem probably means the Founda-
tion of Peace. After which proof of the fact that Mr. Punch
possesses DR: WILLIAM SMITH's invaluable Dictionary of the Bible,
§ former learned man proceeds to show how Peace is kept in
aliena.
A person named DELos HEFFEREN (we know not how he came to
bear the name of the birthplace of Apollo and Diana—which is
fastened to the bottom of the sea by chains, to which we invite the
attention of the Admiralty, as they must be miracles of workman-
ship) had recently the misfortune to murder a person of the name of
HALSTEAD, at Salem. Perhaps it is unfair to call him a murderer,
as he was not tried, he may have been only a manslayer. However,
he found Salem no City of Refuge.
About two in the morning of the 30th ult.,
“A body of masked men entered Salem, seized and held prisoners the
town patrolmen, and, proceeding to the gaol, demanded the keys of DEPUTY-
SHERIFF,CRAycRori, who resides in the building. The Sheriff refused to
give up the keys under any peril, when he was seized and confined, and a
sledge-hammer procured, with which the mob proceeded to force its way into
the cell of DELos HEFFEREN.”
The Sheriff appears to have behaved like a man, and much as the
brave Governor of Newgate did during the Gordon Riots—see
Barnaby Rudge. The mob (the word is not ours; we should not
venture so to describe a body of free and enlightened Citizens) found
that the cell was strºngly protected. But two doors, one of iron,
were broken º and “the murderer stood face to face with the
Vigilants.” . Yes, that is a more gracious name for them. DELos's
vigil had not been a pleasant one, for
“HEFFEREN had watched the #.” of the mob, which came thirsting
for his bl and had prepared himself as well as he could for desperate
resistance... Knowing death awaited him if taken, he determined to fight to
the last, with some pieces of the furniture of his cell. He stood like a tiger at
bay, and guarded the door.”
Or, rather, the doorway. It was not left for him to do as the vassal
is ordered to do in one of JoANNA BAILLIE's powerful dramas:-
“Rise
And set thy brutal strength against the ãoor,” -
for it was already forced. Still, he was not yet vanquished.
“The mob, knowing the desperate character of the man, and that the first
who entered would meet certain death, hesitated to attempt an entrance.
They procured balls of twine, saturated them with coal oil and turpentine,
and threw some of them into the cell, and threw others forward on the ends
of long poles and set them a-blaze. Having thus lighted p the cell, bringing
the victim into full view, the mob opened fire upon him.
If, like the classic hero, he prayed to “die in the light,” his prayer
seemed likely to be granted. There was considerable º
on the part of the Wigilants in contriving this chambre ar ..in
advance. Well, twenty shots were fired at him, and one broke his
right arm, so that he could not use the ºlº. he had—a chair.
Then a “rock” was hurled at his head. This sounds Homeric, but
we fear it was only a big stone; anyhow, it brought him down.
“Before he could recover, he was . tied, and *::: out of the cell
and of the gaol. “What are you going to do with me?' he asked. ‘Hang
you,' was the reply. “I will go along with #. he said. He was immediately
taken to a covered railroad bridge, about thirty feet high, about twołº".
from the gaol, where he asked time to pray, but the lynchers replied they
could not wait.”
Dying in Salem is “parting in Peace,” we suppose, so the Vigil-
ants, who seem to be resolute theologians, held that no special
religious preparation was necessary.
“The rope was put around his neck and thrown over a rafter of the bridge.
HEFFEREN was then pushed off. As soon as he was dead the lynchers returned
to the gaol, gathered up º;; they had left that could afford a clue to
their identity, released the Sheriff and guards, and scattered in every direc:
tion. None were recognised, and no person knows by what road they entered
or left town. The body was hanging till 4 o'clock, when it was taken down-
and brought home.” -
The Wigilants had
The work was certainly not done negligently.

PEBBLE POWDER AND PEPPER.
At the late Naval Inspection at Spithead, the yacht
Lynar, according to a letter in the newspapers from her
owner, had the misfortune to get accidenta # the way,
and close ahead of, a gunboat which was firing salutes
in honour of the SHAH. The salutes were fired with
pebble powder, and “the result may be more readily
imagined than described. The vessel was riddled as with
a charge of grape-shot, five persons severely wounded;
and one burnt with the explosion.” Of course. Not all
the pebbles of pebble powder, when a charge is fired,
explode; some, like some ins. of common powder in
like case, remain entire, and are discharged as projectiles.
Consequently the gunboat astern of the Lynx, in salut-
i the SHAH with the report of pebble powder, also
uted the unlucky Lynx with a shower o pebbles, to
the effect above mentioned. , Moral for yachtsmen—Give
the mouths of guns supposed to be firing blank cartridge
a wide berth, lest they should possibly salute you with
pebble powder, which is both powder and shot.

thought of everything. And as SHAKSPEARE says, “He that is well
hanged in this world needstofearino colours,” for the excellent good
reason that “he shall see none to fear.” The late DELos has no cause
to dread the colour in which his difficulty with HALSTEAD may be
represented to his late fellow-eitizens. Possibly, as he is stated to
have had a “home,” it may now be discovered that he was a
martyr-soul, and that he died for having avenged some outrage on
his s and, Penates. . However, that will not materially alter
matters. ...We know nothing of the circumstances, and it is possible
that the Vigilants may have simply destroyed a ruffian who might
otherwise have escaped moyennant some of the merciful eccentricities
of the criminal law of the country.
For this Salem is not the place of which MELCHIZEDEC was King,

and who look down, with Republican scorn, upon the effete institu-
tions of a rotten old Monarchical country. Jeru—Salem! Yes, Sir.
Yet, on the whole, considering that the most vigilant Vigilants,
being mortal, might confer immortality by mistake, we rather
prefer the Sworn Box and the Black Flag.
THE MUSIC OF INNOCENCE.
THE life of MoscHELEs, latel blished, contains an interesting
story about MENDELssohn a UEEN VICTORIA., The Composer
had paid the QUEEN a visit, during which he played several pieces
before HER MAJESTY and the PRINCE Consort. “You have given
me,” said our Sovereign Lady, “so much pleasure, now, what can I
do to - pleasure?” NDELssohn, “himself the head of a
household, felt mightily interested in the QUEEN's domestic arrange-
ments; in short,” ventured to ask “that he might see the Royal
children in their Royal nurseries.” Whereupon–
“The Queen at onee entered into the spirit of his appeal, and in her
most winning way conducted him herself through the nurseries, all the while
:...ºf notes with him on the homely subjects that had a special attraction
or .”
The notes which the QUEEN compared with MENDELssoRN on
the subject of the nursery were worth preserving. It is known
that HER MAJESTY is well enough ski in music, to be quite
capable of comparing notes with a Master. Very likely MENDELs-
soh N did jot her notes down, and they still exist among his papers.
Had he lived, possibly he would have availed himself of them in
the composition of a symphony on a theme which has never yet
received musical treatment. That is, unless we may regard as
savouring of harmonious effect the suggestive lines, which you
know, boys:-
“Continuſ auditæ voces, vagitus etingens,
Infantumque animaeflentes in limine primo.”
But, considering the place on whose threshold this concert was
heard by the pious AENEAs, we may suppose that the mind's ear of
the Poet imagined other sounds than those of the nursery as they
would have n rendered by the Musician had he composed a
Nursery §. According to Phrenology, the German Com-
oprogenitiveness” appears to have equalled his
poºr “‘Ph
‘Tune,” but much less of the former organ than of the latter is
evinced by the Latin Poet. A Nursery Sym hony by MENDELssohn
would have breathed the sweetness of “The Cradle Song.” But
perhaps VIRGIL's less pleasant conception of that sort of music is
the more matural. e can fancy such music, as conceived by
WIRGIL, just now attending the Massacre of the Innocents.

A FALSE ALARM.
THE BISHop of SALFoRD is too keen-eyed to lose an º
of making a Catholic point. He has been referring to the Judicature
Bill, and, after stating that a tribunal which is not ecclesiastical is
to decide on ecclesiastical questions, he asks— -
“What does this point to? It is the absorption by the State of the
religious independence of the Church of England.”
DR. WAUGHAN was speaking to a Catholic audience, and he was
very properly cheered. The BISHOP of FLEET STREET, addressing
sun. ons who are not Catholic, will with equal propriety, be
cheered when he replies that there is no “absorption” of the kind.
The new tribunal will make no law, but will simply declare the law.
The new tribunal has º to do with the State, except that it
will receive salaries provided by the arts of the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER., Judges who have received a legal and logical educa-
tion are much better qualified to . law than are Bishops, who
have been able schoolmasters, popular preachers, or devoted coun
parsons... English Protestants will be quite satisfied, with suc
ecclesiastical judgments as may be given by men of the school of
LoRDs SELRoRNE, CAIRNs, and HATHERLEy, and will not sigh for
spiritual judges, even if we could get men fike the gracious CULLEN

NEW CODE OF HEALTH.
MR. PUNCH sees advertised “The Ten Laws of Health.” He has
not read the little work, and disclaims all intention of rivalry in
putting forth his own views on the all-important subject of which it
treats. But the interest he feels in every sani movement must
be his excuse for making known to the world a few, simple rules
which he has never known to fail, when rigidly observed, and
perseveringly attended to:—
1. Winter and summer, spring and autumn, always take your
breakfast in bed.
2. In eating and º: ... nothing which you
fancy. Inclination is the only safe rule in these cases.
3. A light supper is your best safeguard against sleeplessness, indi-
gestion, s of unpaid bills and poor relations, and other noctur-
nal disturbances. A lobster, or a buttered crab, or some pickled
salmon, or a nice veal cutlet, or, if there is nothing else at hand, a
hearty meal of toasted cheese, will have a wonde effect upon you,
and cause you to feel in the morning quite another man.
4. Thick soles to boots and shoes would be a laughable mistake, if
they did not lead to such deplorable consequences. They make the
wearer uncomfortable, and cause, the feet to present an unsightly
appearance. Besides, the noise they produce inflicts positive harm
on persons of sensitive nerves.
5. Never get up later than twelve. Never go to bed after three.
Nine hours' sleep is enough for anyone. Perhaps a simpler rule is
never to get up or to go to bed until you feel disposed.
6. If you have the chance of riding, do not waste time, and tissue,
and boot and shoe-leather by walking. Those old-fashioned notions
which some people still entertain about the necessity of exercise
only show how long a superstition will linger on.
7. It is only necessary to think of the incredible number of young
and delicate females who go out to dinners, dances, and other evening
the year, lightly
and airily clad, to be convinced that it is sheer nonsense to take
precautions against damp and the night air.
8. If business, or some other disagreeable necessity, ºl. you
to breakfast early and dine late, on no account be induced to eat
º: in the interval. Dinner is far too important an occurrence
to be encountered with a demoralised appetite. -
9. Always *...*. dinner, and, i #. have the opportunity,
after luncheon (which should be hot and heavy) as well.
10. If ſº must pay attention to your diet, restrict yourself to
pork, veal, curries and other highly-seasoned dishes, broad beans,
ickles, pine-apples, salmon and cucumber, ices, sweets, filberts
uttered toast, pastry in profusion, and all sorts of cool cups and
summer beverages.
Platform Amalgamation.
IT is proposed that the United Kingdom Alliance, the Temperance
League, the Anti-Tobacco Society, and all the other confederacies
for minding other peoples' business, shall amalgamate themselves
together into one comprehensive. band of busybodies, under the
name of “The Pragmatic Association.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ERTAINLY there was

House on Friday,
Mr. Punch regret his
having taken holiday
on that day. The
. thing which
rhaps he might
ave liked to hear
was MR. GIADSTONE’s
reply to MR. WHAL-
LEY. The latter
Statesman's mind had
been exercised by an
account of a visit of
some Catholics to
Canterbury Cathedral
—the history of which
was explained to them
- by a Jesuit gentle-
man. This awful º ht before the House, and MR. GLAD-
SToxE, for the sake o
ish outrage MR. WHALLEY bro
fun, answered him in the most elaborate manner (an attention entirely
thrown away on MR. WHALLEy), and assured him that if he, the great Protestant, desired
also to lecture in the Cathedral, and would undertake to do so in a becoming way
no doubt that he might. Perhaps the satire was a trifle ponderous for so hot a ni ht. and the
House ought to have been the more grateful to MR. GLADSToxE for taking so º trouble.
M -The DUKE of RICHMOND AND LENNox, stating that 22.45 Military Officers have,
or think that they have, reason to complain of the way in which the Abolition of Purchase is
being worked out, moved for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the subject. LoRDLANs-
Downe, for Government, resisted the Motion, alleging that it was b , not on any real
£º but on the old Army feeling of hostility to the Abolition. The CoMMANDER-IN-
CHIEF declined to interfere, having accepted the new system, but he thought that discontent
in the Army was most detrimental to the interests of the Country. Government were beaten
by 129 to 46, and might as well have conceded what was certain to be taken.
But the Čomedy ºf the evening came next. We must go back to history a little. Our
most religious and gracious King, CHARLEs THE Second, showered the beams of his royal
favour upon various charming persons, and among these were a lady known in France as
Louise DE LA QUEROUAILLE § in England, vide PEPYs, as MADAME CARRol), and a lady
known to most persons as NELL NN. The children of these respected ladies, as
MR. SAVAGE says, “Lived to build, not boast, a generous race.” His gracious Majesty con-
ferred certain peerages, which, at the present time, are held by the DUKE of St. ALBANs,
Hereditary Grand Falconer of England, and by the DUKE of RICHMOND, leader of Her
Majesty's º in the House of Lords. To-night these Dukes amused themselves and the
world with a little family wrangle. The Falconer, recently talking at a banquet, referred to
the fact that the QUEEN had been educated, politically, by LoRD MELBourne, and he
º satisfaction that HER MAJESTY had always been a Liberal.
he DUKE of RICHMOND, as a Tory, objected to this, and to-night demanded of his
remote relative what he meant by claiming *. QUEEN as a political partisan, a course which
his GRACE of RICHMOND described as unconstitutional.
The DUKE of St. ALBANs replied with spirit, but introduced an anecdote which he might
as well have omitted, as it was rather in the style of his distinguished ancestress than in that
of a noble Peer. He had been able to make a precise answer, just as some witness had been
able to do, when interrogated about a certain distance. “I measured it, in case any Fool
might ask me the question.” This might have been a repartee by “poor NELLY.”
The DUKE of Rich Mond left it to their Lordships to decide whether he were a Fool or not.
But no division was taken upon this question, and
The DUKE of St. ALBANs had not the least intention of bein rsonal or offensive. He
explained that LoRD MELBourne's counsels to the QUEEN ha rne the best fruit, HER
MAJESTY having always rendered the most impartial and sincere support to any Ministry
whose services she had required.

The MARQUIs of SALISBURY thought
that the DUKE of ST. ALBANs had aggra-
vated his original offence. He made a joke
about MAUNDER A. maundering” being the
moral), which induces us to say that if he
will apply at 85, Fleet Street, he may hear
º: to his advantage. He added
divers caustic criticisms on the banquet in
question, and objected to its having been
said that an irresistible majority in the
Lords put up “inferior men” to debate.
By some statistical process the Marquis
seems to have convinced himself that there
is about 2% per cent. of º among the
Clergy and in both Houses of Parliament.
But for fear of breach of privilege we
should say that this was rather a low
average.
This was the scene of the evening. The
hot weather had, perhaps, something to do
with it.

When theºrieh blood of Peers is set-on-fire!”
Much time was taken up in the Commons

the business of the Session.* ing was
done, however, and then
MR. GLADSToxE explained a Bill for re-
moving a legal doubt as to the power of the
Crown to bequeath Landed Estates to the
Heir-Apparent. Rather an interesting
debate ensued, some constitutional theories
being ventilated, and a few Members getting
a little out of the ordinary Westry tone.
The Bill was read a Second Time by 167
to 35.
Tuesday.—In the House of Lords
tributes were maid to the memories of
two eminent Members of that House.
DR. WILBERFoRCE, Bishop of Win-
chester, had been º away

his energy and intellect. Loan west.
BURY, more aged, but not less able,
had been stricken with º: On
the previous Saturday the Bishop, and
oil #. Sunday, the ex-Changellor, had
died. Here, it is fitting to do no more
than record these greatinational losses.
In the House of Commons, in the morning,
there were long and fierce fights on the
Edueation Question, and they were renew
in the evening. The enemies of the Gov-
ernment Bill were routed all along the line,
and the Bill went through Committee.
We have the honour of congratulating
the country on the fact that to-night the
Commons passed the Judicature Bill. -
GLADston Eintimated that, importantasthe
Bill was, it would be incomplete until its
rovisions were extended to the whole king-
om. Incidentally, MR. ANDERSON, a
Scotch Member, endeavoured to remove the
impression that the representatives of Sºot-
land get all they want by attending to their
own. $º. Their constituents abuse
them for not making themselves as dis-
agreeable to Government as the Irish do.
Without wishing to be rude to anybody,
Mr. Punch may remark that, for reasons,
the Scottish gentlemen are disqualified for
doing anything of the sort, and their eon-
stituents are unreasonable.

day's proceedings like spinach, but they

opinion was that such extension of franchise was just and politic, and
could not be long avoided. There was much sensation caused by
this announcement that a new Reform Bill would soon be heard of,
and there was some sarcasm about a “Message from the Minister.”
The feeling was that the matter was taken out of MR. TREVELYAN's
hands, but the Bill was talked over until the fatal 5'45.
The Bill for letting persons be buried in the State-Church-yard
with any rites which their friends may devise was withdrawn.
Thursday.—LoRD CAIRNs complained of º used in the
other House by two Ministers, who, he thought, had implied that he
and the late LoRD WESTBURY had accepted private business which
interfered with their duties in the House of Lords. He satis-
factorily explained that they had done nothing of the kind, and
LoRD SELBoRNE assured him that no imputation had been intended.
This was no doubt the case, but enough had been said to justify
LoRD CAIRNs in being very promptin defence of himself and his
lately departed friend.

And so, Life's judgment set to right by Death's,

Tor and VENATOR walk
across the Meadows to-
wards their Inn, and fall
in with two Milk-maidens.
Venator. 0, Master, tell
me, as we walk along the

while one is fishing, the

.# scarcely even breathe P
Piscator. Marry, Scholar,
he should indeed be silent,
and breathe lightly. For,
you must know, that a
proficient can catch as good
a fish as swims, with a fine
line from one of the poets,
if he be but careful to let
itfall with 'bated breath.
Wenator. What books
should a fisherman read?
Piscator. I would recom-
'mend for your study Bleak
House, Dr. Newman's Lec-
tures on Angle-can-Düſſi-
eulties, The History of the
Rod, Hook's Remains, Hook's Archbishops of º Can- *V,
The Gentle Life, Line upon Line, and many others of a like mature.
Venator. Truly,
discourse for ever.
my loving Master, I d listen to your learned
%. resolve me this, which I have heard pro-
}: *: a difficulty to fishermen. When does a Trout exhibit
| fatigue
Piscator. Well, Scholar, I should reply when he sleeps.
Venator. Nay, Master, were you to make such an answer you
would err, for the right solution of my-question is to this effect, that
a Trout shows his fatigue when he stops to take a fly.” “O, Master,
O! it hurts | -
Piscator. Such is my intention, and this use of the rod is to
impress, on your memory, the remark of the venerable ALDERMAN
GUTTLER, that “he who would play a fish must not play the fool.”
Venator. I thank you, Master. These words are worthy to keep
a room in every brain where, as the łºś say, the memory of
man runneth: not to the contrary. But I think it is now milking
time, and yonder they be at it. -
Piscator. On my word, a handsome milk-maid that hath not yet
attained so much age and wisdom as to know the distinction between
a pike and the leg of a harmless lamb.
Venator. Ah, my kind Master, how beneficent is Nature who has
made the lamb’armless and not legies. * * * O, Master, O!" +
I will never offend again. -
Piscator. Exchange is no theft; so, as we have no use for this
pike, we will persuade her to give us flesh for the fish. She is
indeed a blooming rose.
Venator. This rose is near-an elder, Master; for, look, she is in
company bfan old maid.
Piscator. An old milk-maid, but, as I think, her grandmother.
Yet, for all her age, I as open to fair speaking as is her
comely daughter or º: And for a little confirmation
of what I have said, I shall repeat the lines of DE BARNAcLEs—

A T)READFUL SCENE OF DRINKING.
THE annual National Temperance fete was celebrated on Tuesday
last week at the Crystal Palace. According to the Times:–
“‘By arrangement,’ mo beer or other intoxicating liquors were supplied to
the places open to the general crowd, although in the dining-rooms and the
saloons circumstances in this particular were as ‘on ordinary days.”
There was nothing to drink but “a warm fluid about four or five
times the eost of public-house beer, and "leavin
thirsty than before.” This nectar “was variously called lemonade,
gingerade, and such fine names.” The Times continues:–
“It was pitiful to see young persons, after ºf this stuff, and finding ||
their ets and stomachs not to agree-with it (all-t jº. in the water-
tank being gone), walk to the lake, and bale out and drink water a little less
wholesome than the dustheap-adulterated tanks of some of our Water
Companies.”
The writer of the above touching passages is to be pitied. Poor
fellow! The Times correspondent in the Crimea at least never
suffered the drought which appears to have been experienced by the
Times correspondent at the #. rance festival in the Crystal
Palace. But he, perhaps, contrived to “make it out” in some one
of the dining-rooms or saloons, where circumstances, in the -
ticular of º: drink, were “as on ordinary days,” and not
as on days of the full moon in a lunatic asylum.
. But saloon and ºf..." charges for a glass of ale are some-
times preposterous; and next }. any gentleman of the Press, not
commissioned by the Band of Hope Review, or some other organ of

nion, or vade mecum, o tº: habitans in succo among the

The managers of the National Temperance fete at the Crystal
Palace displayed much less intelligence than was to be expected of
them in not taking care that their constituents and associates should
be provided with at least an ample supply of Nature's own prºvision
for quenching thirst. If they interdicted them from Bass and ALL-
sopp's ale, they ought at least to have secured them a sufficiency of
ADAM's, and #. good. The Ass, although the proverbial emblem
of stupidity, has at least the sense, in respect of drinking, to be very
fastidious about his water.

POST-OFFICE ECONOMY.
THE Postmen are imploring a little increase of their ever, but
now, in these dear times, more than ever inadequate salaries. Their
agitation for higher wages is stifled by threats of dismissal.
Hºly these menaces are effectual, and our letter-carriers do not
strike. †† on the other hand, too many of them are tempted
to eke out a subsistence by stealing the contents of money-letters.
This practice is, however, in a great measure checked by the
registration necessitated for letters which contain money. . But the
registration of letters containing money in the form of postage
stamps is not as yet imperative; so some of the straitened letter-
carriers sometimes even postage-stamps out of letters. To
stop this pilfering also, what expedient can be more obvious than
that of extending the registration system to letters in which po -
stamps are enclosed? Accordingly, the PostMASTER-GENERAL
announced that he proposes to institute this arrangement on the
1st of August, to continue thenceforward. MR. MonsELL, however,
as a simply economical Minister, seems not to be so thorough as his
#ºf coll es. He has stated that his proposed new rule
will not be enforced until the House of Commons has had
opportunity of recording an opinion on its expediency.
t is to be apprehended that Parliament will condemn it, as
ubjecting letter-writers to an inconvenient and vexatious impost
without sufficient reason. The p se of preventing underpaid
postmen from being tempted to steal will, perhaps, hardly appear
sufficient to Honourable Gentlemen. Too many Honourable Gentle-
men, probably, are unprepared to go so far in parsimony as to
in the proposition that anything is preferable to the slightestincrease
of subordinate officials' wages.

A GLUT OF DIAMONDS.
THE increased price of coal coincides with a reduction of the cost
of a purer form of carbon. Whilst black diamonds are quoted at
high figures, the rates commanded by diamonds proper are very low.
Amongst commercial intelligence it is announced that “the market
for diamonds continues in a very depressed state, owing to the
abundance of the supply.” Some of our wealthier readers, hereto-
fore wont, at this time of the year, to be apprised by their coal-
merchants of their usually reduced prices for the season, may have
received, instead of that accustomed notice, a circular from their
#. recommending them, on the assumption that they most
ikely have, or are in the way to have, wives, daughters, or other
female relations, to seize the #. favourable #. of
laying in a stock of diamonds. e wisdom of º provident
forethought will be manifest from the statement that, “with the
exception of stones of very large size, and brilliants and small rose
diamonds of the very finest quality, the fall in value has been
general, and in some descriptions, such as rose-cut diamonds of
mediocre to middling quality, equal to from 30 to 40 per cent.”
Should the º diamon ºft on increasing in excess of the
demand, it may be that they will sink to a point of depreciation
which will give cause for regret that the diamond, although com-
bustible, is not sufficiently so as to allow diaphanous diamonds to
be substituted for sable, and burnt instead of coals. Otherwise this
is the result which might #. ensue from a progressive
augmentation of the output of diamonds.

the lobe of one ear is completely cut off, three front teeth knocked out, one fearful wound

The other life in danger is that of a person not as yet known, but likely to
be. MARY WILLIAMs, mangled in the manner above described, had, under
treatment at Richmond Infirmary, “rallied sufficiently to give a few important
particulars which, it is hoped, will lead to the detection of her murderous
assailant.” That murderous assailant, therefore, is another whose life is in
danger too. The ºf: of her life endangers that ruffian's. He is likely to
be caught, and, should she die, will no doubt be hanged. In case she gets well
however, he will escape the gallows he deserves. ark here the wisdom an
justice of the law which determines the capital punishment of a criminal by a
contingency, the decision of which he has nothing to do with. In the case of
MARY WILLIAMs, “the great danger that is feared is that erysipelas will set
in.” . Should that happen, and death ensue, then her “murderous assailant”
will be legally guilty of murder, and not otherwise; but, whether she live or
die, he will remain equally murderous and equally meritorious of the rope. The
absurdity of making his punishment depend on the strength of his victim's
constitution would be utterly revolting to reason and justice but for the con-
sideration that, in a case of robbery and attempt to murder, the ruffian who
is a murderer to all intents and purposes incurs, if convicted, a doom perhaps
worse than that of death. By the zealous exertions of a prison chaplain the
execution of the worst of murderers, if he have paid effectual attention, to the
exhortations of the rev. gentleman, is, we must believe, rendered “ and
salary, not revenge.” hereas the hire of robbery with violence is a good
flogging, and the salary is penal servitude for life. Should MARY WILLIAMs
survive, it may be that the savage who has maimed her will have to pass as
bad a quarter of an hour under the cat-o'-nine-tails as he could in the noose,
and, after that, to exist at least for many years in a state which will permit
nobody to think that he is, in Paradise, but will be as far from it as any
condition almost in this world, except, perhaps, that of the Workhouse.

SELL's announcement had been made, but that is a mere detail. He
is not going to º on a Monday to please all the MR. MonsELLs
in the world. But he would remark that the surrender of the plan
was as debilitated a piece of business as its invention, for no new
argument had been used againstit—only the Press had pointed out
that the Post-Office must be Colney Hatch to conceive the idea.
A great—well, scandal is hardly the word-but judge for your-
selves—“name this child.” MR. AYRTON, snubbed by his colleagues
in regard to a piece of Thames Embankment, or rather the erections
to be placed thereon, has disavowed responsibility in a way which is
unmistakably unministerial, and over his disavowal there was a
| fight of some bitterness. He himself is not exactly honey on velvet,
and the weather is hot, and altogether—
| Tuesday.—LoRD GRANVILLE moved and Lord SALISBURY seconded
|an Address to the QUEEN thanking Her for the communication She
was pleased to make about the intended marriage of his Royal High-
|ness ALFRED ERNEST ALBERT, DUKE of EDINBURGH, EARL of
KENT, EARL OF ULSTER, DUKE OF SAxony, PRINCE OF SAxE CoEURG
|AND GoTHA, and Her Imperial Highness the GRAND DUCHESs MARIE
|ALEXAND Row NA, only daughter of His Imperial Majesty the
EMPEROR of ALL THE RUSSIAs, and intimating that the Peers will
|be delighted to concur in any arrangement that may seem desirable.
|LORD SALISBURY remarked that though Royal matrimonial alliances
|might not again be the means of ing this country into war,
they might be means towards the maintenance of peace, and that it
is a matter of congratulation that the Royal House of England is
now connected with the Royal Houses of three great nations, the
†† Sclavonic, and the Teutonic. Young tlemen
|at home for the holidays will please ask their sisters these
|names mean, and for explanation generally, and will make note
thereof, but not upon their left shirt-cuffs or thumb-nails.
We just note that in discussion on an Education Bill, four peers
spoke, LoBD Powis, LoBD FoETEscue, LoRD NELSox, and the Bishop
of LoNDON, and that not one of them was ible in the gallery.
Really their Lordships should send for MR. WALTER LACY or MR.
RYDER, and take a few lessons in the art of not “swallowing the
voice,” as BISHOP BERKELEY called it.
LoRD HARRow By demanded a list of the signatures to that Petition
for Confession. We are sorry that he allowed himself to be talked
out of pressing his Motion, as we should like to know the clerical
gentlemen who want to break into families and “lead captive silly
women.”. The chief point of his opponents was that many men ha
been fools enough to sign the petition without exactly, knowing
what it was about. Certainly such folks are just the persons to be
our guides and advisers in the most momentous of all matters!
LoRD HATHERLEY told a story illustrative of the folly of some
petitioners. A teacher in a Sunday School had been convicted of
trying to murder her father and mother. If she had succeeded, we
suppose she would have imitated the Frenchman, who, having
ed the Court to have mercy
on a poor orphan. But she failed, and a petition was got up in her
favour urging that if sent abroad she would be a useful teacher in
some of our colonial schools. Wery, no doubt. A class would be
much edified by her comments on the Sixth Commandment, especially
if she gave details from experience. Another New Maudlin.
In the Commons, MR. GLADSTONE announced the amount of the
|grant which it was proposed to make to the Duke of Enºurgh.
|He has already £15,000 a year, to which we shall now add £10,000.
|In the event of the Grand Duchess surviving H.R.H., she will
|receive £6000 a year. M.R. Hunt, for the Conservatives, supported
the PREMIER's proposition. MR. PETER TAYLoR, whose mighty
mind embraces everything, from a cock-fight to a Royal Dowry,
gave notice of opposition. MR. Hoºr wished to know the Grand
Duchess's religion, and was told by MR. GLADSToxE that he had no
business to ask the question. The House was to respect religious
convictions wherever it found them.
This brought cheers, and was all very well... Mr. Punch detests
both bigotry, and, impertinence. . But, all things considered, he
thinks that there is a certain mealy-mouthedness in certain Parlia-
mentary utterances. The religion of the reigning family is, at all
events, an important matter in the eye of the British Constitution,
and it is going rather too far in the way of fastidiousness to say that,
when the nation is asked to make a marriage settlement, nobody is
to inquire in what faith the children are to be educated. That sort
of feeling is more akin to the Philistine “modesty” of under-bred
people, who are º ready to be shocked, than tothereal modesty
of frank, highly-b le, who know that nobody of their own
class means anything shocking. - -
Then we had the Post ði, business. Briefly told, 'tis this.
MR. ScupAMoRE, the very able and zealous gentleman to whom most
of the efficiency of the Postal and Telegraph Systems is due, wanted

money to work the latter, and took it out of funds which, legally, he
was not authorised so to employ. But he made the system go
capitally, and as MR. GLADSTONE said, an error prompted by zeal
was balanced by the great services he had rendered to the public.
We had a long debate about the matter, but it was interesting only
as a comic illustration of the adroitness of º: men who try to
shift blame from themselves to others, and MR. Osborn E told the
House that the scene was evidence of a *ś Government and
a worn-out Opposition. He added that MR. Scudamſon E had acted
with chivalry, and offered to take the whole blame on himself, but
it was MR. Lowe who was in fault. The Post MASTER was merely
Slacid and uncom º By 161 to 111 the House, adopted a
solution by which SIR JoBN LUBBoCK let everybody down with a
gentle expression of regret.
The case of the Custom House Clerks at the Outports has been
taken up by Mr. Punch. LoRD SANDoN pressed it on the House
to-night, and the Government professed a desire to do justice
but seemed terribly disinclined to pin themselves to any sort of
engagement as to the amount of such justice or the time of doing it.
In fact, the screw had not been put on hard enough, eh, MR. Low Ef
But next day MR. GLADSTONE promised that the matter should
really receive attention.
Wednesday.—Nothing of interest, except that MR. GIApston E
ublicly explained to MR. Ayrtos that the latter's theory of
*:::::::ii responsibility would not hold water.
Thursday,+Mr. Punch is happy to announce that the Judicature
Bill received final attention from the Lords, who agreed to all the
Commons' amendments. That valuable measure has passed:—
“So Law and Equity will fuse,
Or each can wear à. other's shoes.”
MR. OTwAY, next Session, means to move to shorten Parliaments.
A despairing cry from a gentleman in hot weather. But let him
get the speeches shortened, and he shall be as famous as his name-
sake. o was he? you ask, dear Madam. The dramatist,
THOMAs, who lived between 1651 and 1685, and whom you ought to
love, for writing—
“0 woman, lovely woman! Nature made thee
To temperman; we had been brutes without you.
Ange's are painted fair to look like you;
There's in you all that we believe of Heaven—
Amazing brightness, purity, and truth,
Eternal joy, and everlasting love.”
You adore him, don't you? That shows your confiding heart.
The willain could write very differently about you. The above is
from Venice Preserved. But in the Orphan he asks—
“What mighty ills have not been done by woman
Destructive, damnable, deceitful woman!”
Let that be a lesson to you never to trust a man because he can
say pretty things.
R. PETERTAYLOR distinguished himself twice to-night, and gave
us great comfort, for though MR. WHALLEY is gºing
tout for the man who is being tried for perjury at Westminster, MR.
TAYLOR will remain to delight us with his wit and wisdom. To-
night he got *. upon that cock-fighting cock-and-bull story, and
“caught it” from MR. BRUCE, who very easily showed that the
grievance was no grievance at all.
MR. GLADSTONEmoved the Second Reading of the DUKE of EDIN-
BURGH's Annuity Bill, and MR. PETER TAYLoR opposed it in a long
speech, and protested in the name of 10,000 workmen at Leicester
sº. such a grant. Colon EL North, for the Conservatives, and
MR. BouvKRIE, as an old Whig, supported the Bill, and then MR.
GLADSTONE very needlessly defended it against MR. TAYLOR, who
must have been more flattered at hearing what he no doubt thought
were arguments dealt with by such a man as the PREMIER than
discomfited at beholding every one of them crushed with the most
exquisite ease. However, he divided the House, and 164 voted for
the Annuity, and 20 for MR. PETER TAYLOR's indicrous crotchets.
Then we had the Indian Budget. But as MR. GRANT DUFF said
India is so “ghastly dull” a subject to most people, that we shali
merely observe that he has got a splendid balance, and isſºng to
lay out nearly all of it on remunerative improvements in India. He
struck the right note, saying that unless we were prepared to go on
civilising India, without waiting till the natives asked us to do so
we had better flin up the Empire. MR. FAwgETT moved a vote of
hostility to the Indian Government, and said that much of the
Revenue came out of Capital. This debate was twice adjourned.
We are not in very good humour with India just now. e finest
statue in London, MR. Foley's “Outram,” is now set up in
Waterloo Place, and delights all eyes. And it is to be sent to
India. Perhaps, however, this is best, for all the other statues
blush through their bronze at the contrast.
Friday.—The Lords reduced the º Bill into one affecting
only the relations between Masters and Workmen. Government
were sweetly “agreeable.” Ministers quarrel only with one another.
to America to lai
Commons' Committee on the Duke of Edinburgh's Annuity Bill.
It was opposed by SIR CHARLEs DILKE, and MR. GLADSTONE said
that there was something like Indecency in the course that had
been taken. In answer to complaint that the Bill had been intro-
duced late, the PREMIER grew tender.
“GAto's a proper person to entrust
A love-tale with,”
But our CATo had recollections of youthful feelings:—
“Does my hom. friend think that the sentiment of love can be restrained?
‘Love, free as air, at sight of human ties
Spreads his light wings and in a moment flies.”
(Laughter.) These things are not under my control with regard to Royal
!. or anybody else. I cannot fix the time at which the invader should
e . to occupy their hearts, and to bring to an issue these great
questions.”
. Later, he explained that he had used the severe word cited only
in reference to the persistent resistance to the feeling of the House.
Afterwards, there was question as to the Duke's receiving his
Annuity when he should have become a German Prince. But MR.
GLADSToxE said that His Royal Highness would not thereby cease
to be an English Gentleman. The Bill went through Committee.
Saturday.—The Commons passed that Bill, and got through the
Indian Budget. “Courage, lads, Land!” as PLATo said when near
the end of a dull book.
A KNIGHTLY ACHIEVEMENT.
Epulously the Good Temp-
lars, modestly self-styled,
are engaged among the
fanatics under the banner
of SIR WILFRID LAwson
in a crusade against the
Liquor Trade. As yet,
however, they do not ap-
pear to have succeeded in
closing a single hostelry.
Another Order of Knights,
who leave their ess
to be demonstrated by their
deeds, have been more suc-
cessful. St. John's Gate,
Clerkenwell, for some years
past a publichouse, has been
rescued from Bung by the
English Order of St. John's
Own Knights. Our Knights
of St. John have, by pur-
chase, regained possession
of that venerable but dese-
crated structure, and of the
freehold whereon it stands.
With the devotion of true
sons of chi they pro-
ose to redeem it from the service of Bung and Bacchus, and restore
it to its pristine beauty in honour of their Patron Saint, and also
that of DR. Johnson and his Patron, CAve the bookseller, DAVID
GARRICK, and its other memories, including SYLVANUs URBAN.
The birthplace of the Gentleman's Magazine has now got into the
hands of gentle Knights, and, according to the Globe, St. John's
Gate, completely repaired at their ch “will in time face and
glorify the new street now being forme m Old Street to Oxford
Street.” What have the Templars who call themselves Good done
in the way of Knighthood to match this achievement of gallantry
and largess on the part of those true Knights, the English Qrder of
the Knights of St. John? These are named in full the Knights of
St. John of Jerusalem; those others werather associate with Jericho,
as the place they should go to.
REASON AND RBIYME.

Enough to term a Quack Priest.

to a close.
Venator. And, O Master, my money is well nigh gone.
Piscator. True happiness is not in riches. But for this line I was
speaking of. You must dye your hair with a pint of strong ale, a
pound of soot, a little quantity of the juice of walnut-tree leaves,
boiled in a pipkin. Lay it on smoothly with your brush, and drive
it in thin. It will turn your hair to a kind of greenish yellow. Once
doing will serve if you lay it on well, for doubtless such coloured
hair is most choice and the most useful for an angler, but let it not
be too green. Now we are at the river, go to that hollow tree and
throw your line.
Venator. It is a beautiful seat in the hollow tree, and I have so
craftily disposed my legs in a cleft of the trunk that I cannot be
pºllº,ºut y the strongest pike. 0, Master! . . . here is a wasp!
Piscator. Wasps build their nests in hollow trees on the banks of
a stream. I go on quickly to the next meadow.

out of the tree! O! . . . O' . . . 01 . . . I am free! . . . they

PARLIAMENT leaves us, and Convocation is not sitting, so we can

REVERENCE AND CONTEMPT OF COURT.
CoNTEMPT of Court, it stands to common sense,
Is a particularly grave offence.
And clearly, printed comment on report
Of pending trial is Contempt of Court.
For who can fail to see, if not stone-blind,
How it must prejudice a jury's mind?
Because no : forces rule the pen,
As wig and gown the tongues of chartered men.
Clad in long robe, and crowned with equine hair,
The Pleader cannot s one word unfair,
Inspired with reason by the horsehair crown,
With honour and with justice by the gown,
Pure logic flows from his superior part,
While genuine feeling gushes from his heart.
Two things no Barrister did ever do;
Suggest the false, or falsify the true,
By knavish innuendo or pretence,
Cajolery or illusive eloquence. -
A witness perjured he will ne'er surmise, ..
Whilst 'tis himself that lies and knows he lies.
He never, fee'd to play a client's e,"
Q never, foully tries to blast fair fame!
His earnest words express his firm belief;
For º: believes his brief. -
Say what he will, his words can nought avail
Of Justice by false weight to sink the scale.
He only should your jurymen address;
But, sad to say, you can but gag the Press.
In club, at , in converse, every kind.
Of critic has the power to speak his mind;
And their Contempt of Court is freely shown
Not in discussion unrestrained alone; -
º: that gives the face of Court such kicks
As might the very hair of wigs unfix.
'Twere dreadful such contempt of Court should be,
If it balked justice in the least degree.

POETRY FOR PETER TAYLOR.
O UNGRACIous P. A. TAYLOR,
Chieftain of the al clan'
Would you stint our Royal Sailor P
Most unsympathetic man!
Were he nothing to the nation
But an ornamental Prince,
Discontent at his dotation
You with reason might evince.
But e'en then, and though his Mother
On her People claim had none,
One with feeling for another
Would enrichment vote her son.
Could you, for a single minute,
Put yourself in ALFRED's place,
And just think how you’d feel in it,
PETER!—but you’ve not the grace.
Else would happiness and pleasure
Thrill throughout your heart and soul,
With such force, and in such measure,
As you scarcely could control.
O what bliss, ere on the shad
Side of thirty, should be life
To the lord of a young lady,
With enough to keep his wife'
To confer that bliss on any
Who’d not vote, at loss above
Scarce a fraction of a penny ?
PETER, were you e'er in love?
For a trifle, whilst we never
º all Princes can require,
Let the labourer be, however,
Held as worthy of his hire.
Must the State, which full provision
Makes for children of the Crown,
Close, with cynical precision,
Cut its clerks and postmen down P
With a happy Prince though sweeter
Sympathy must ever be,
With contented workmen, PETER,
Sweet it were in some degree.
TEA-CUP TrME.-If you invite people to
afternoon tea, do your best to e it
lively and agreeable. You would not like
your guests to go away protesting that the
entertainment had been a humdrum affair.
LIBERAL CONSERVATION OF COMMONS.
. CHELSEA is represented by a very advanced Liberal, who yet may
in one particular be accounted a thorough Conservative. But herein
he commends himself to every true Liberal. The name of SIR
CHARLEs DILKE stands next after that of MR. CowPER-TEMPLE on
the Committee of the Commons Protection Society, whose signatures
are appended to an appeal in the Times for contributions in aid of
the conservation of Commons. Especially they ask assistance to
enable the labouringº: at Westerham and Gerrard's Cross to
contest the stoppage of their immemorial habit of cutting gorse and
heather for their own use; a prohibition effected at Westerham by
É. success of !. Fº taken before a Bench of the Great
npaid by a Colonel, and at Gerrard's Cross by the agency of the
rural police invoked by the Lord of the Manor—a Parson.
The truly Liberal Conservatives, who represent the Society above
, in a previous communication addressed to the Times, enu-
merated upwards, of nine instances, in which the rights of the
country people had been invaded by the little tyrants of their fields.
These, under the pretence of being Lords of the Manor, had com-
mitted various acts of tyranny. Prosecuting, people for cutting
gorse and turf to boil their pot withal after the manner of their

- s e the poor. e summoned boys for playin
. ; had perpetrated several . ..; had erec
fences across paths to stop the public; had cut down trees on public
land. In attempting some of these atrocities, however, they were
successfully resisted. As, for instance, in the course of cutting
down trees on a village-green, in Hertfordshire, the scene of an
annual fair, and the venerable site of the parish stocks around which
the trees had been planted. Some of these, which had been felled,
the villagers cut in pieces, which they took away, and defended the
rest by main force. Sued in the County Court, though the defend-
ants were declared by the Judge to have no right to appropriate the
trees which had been cut down, the plaintiff, on the other hand, was
decided to have had no right to cut them down. So a brute was
baffled. There is scarcely anything that affords keener gratification
to a well-constituted mind than the successful enforcement by com-
moners of rights against an encroaching Lord of the Manor, espe-
cially when they tear down a fence with the law on their side; or
do him any other legal *::::::: which*: him to great expense;
the greater the more delightful to think upon. This pleasure can
be purchased by forwarding subscriptions to the Commons Protec-
tion Society. The address of 1, Great College Street, S.W., is given
by those public-spirited Conservative Liberal gentlemen. Who,
that can, will not contribute his mite to the defence of Right?
A Short Way with Savages.
THE Ashantees are giving us a great deal of trouble. We have
had much ado with the Maories, and with the native tribes of Africa.
The Dutch are worried by the Atcheenese; the Yankees bothered
with the Red Indians. By-and-by, perhaps, philanthropists of
enlarged views will set up an Aborigines Extermination Society.
SPEECHLEss!—It is whispered that the CHANCELLOR OF THE Ex-
CHEQUER and the CHIEF CommissionER of WoRKs are not on speak-
ing terms. On such terms with each other, only suppose those two
amiable Ministers were on the same terms with the House!

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
UGUST 2nd, Saturday.—Mr. Punch briefly mentioned what passed on
this day, and perhaps there is no reason (but his own sweet will)
for reverting to it. Yet as you, Madam, do now receive the last
Essence with which, for certain months to come, he hopes to oblige
you, he is minded to discourse unto you at some length. Therefore
let his words flow from his lips like honey, as was the case with
Nestor, who must have regretted that serviettes were not in use at
the siege of Troy. Which reminds him to express his satisfaction
that the Rev. Doctor Bee-Master has been fortunate with his bees,
and that the QUEEN has condescended to accept a quantity of his
honey. Would she send half a pint to MR. AYRTon, andlet PRINCEss
BEATRICE kindly write on the label, In hoc rinces?
On this Saturday, the ante-penultimate day of the Session, there
was final debate on the Indian Budget. MR. Fawcett had pro
to condemn the present constitution of the Government of India.
MR. DENISON him, and considered the Hon. Member's speech
to be mischievous. Let us, however, throw open the Service to
Selected Natives. Certainly. We shall also be happy to throw
open our mouth to them anytime after the 31st instant, unless they
are going to be three-pence a-piece.
SIR. G. BALFour, thirty-years ago, had applied himself to opium.. This was a portentous beginning, but he made an excellent speech,
and advocated Economy. e also advocate it, except when there is question of spending other people's money, and then, our heart
expands, and werealise the famous idea of philanthrºpy. A sees B in distress, and is particularly desirous that G should help him.
sm. D. Wºmenºn was for conceding, in a modified form, representation to India. This is not a new notion, of course, Madam,
and, moreover, it will have to be considered, some day. The time º come when yourwill see dusky voterswalking down “India's

MR. J. F. LEITH, who is an authority on the question, having for
several years seen—
“The nice morn, on the Indian steep,
From her cabined loophole peep,”
thought, that MR. GRANT DUFF's statement was satisfactory, and
that, we had a right to look for better times in India. flºt he

MR. LEITHimentioned one which all young ladies going to the East
will agree with him in describing: as mischievous and iniquitous;
namely, the tax imposed on Suitors. This accounts for the fly
marriages that take place in India. It occurs to us to add, generally,
ne-sutor ultra crepidam-let no suitor go beyond his last—flirtation,
at least unless he sees that a pleasanter one is to be had.
MR. AYRTON.—come, Madam, he has a right to be heard on such
topies-objected to a proposal to forestal the report of avery import-
ant Indian Committee, which has been sitting for three years. He
pointed out, with ability, the absurdity of ing mere arithmetic

at stake. But he desired that official

we have heard of iron tears down Pluto's cheek, but we do not see:
MR. AYRTON among a bevy of laughing girls, passing, the satin
slipper, and a joke at its smallness. Who can have told him that
there was such a game?
MR. withdrew his Amendment, and expressed satisfac-
tion, that greater responsibility was to be established. The Indian-
Budget passed. “B t” is derived from the French º :
but a facetious M.P., whose name wild horses or wild curates should
not induceus to reveal, said, this afternoon, that the word reminded
him of a Shakspearian passage. “Budge!” says the fiend. “Budge

Monday.—LoRD REDESDALE madefinal protestation against paying
£3,500,000 to the United States. The LoRD CHANGELLOR: that
it was child's play to re-open the question now. May be, so, but
have we not played rather a childish game all through the matter?
By the way, what sort of children does LoRD SELBoRNE, know?
They must be precocious little objectionabilities, if one of their
sports is playing at Geneva Arbitrations.
In the Commons various Notices for next Session were given, but
sufficient unto the Session is the Evil thereof; we shall not mention
them, especially as Honourable Members have, probably, six months
in which to repent their intended sins.
You know that Spain is given up to Civil War, Madam, and that
there is a triangular duel. CHARLEs VII., whom we must continue
to call a Pretender until his pretensions are vindicated by success,
is, with the aid of the priests, butchering in one quarter, and the
Reds, or Communists, who are the most execrable scum of the
country, are butchering in another. Opposed to both is something
calling itself a Republican Government, which is abominably ill-
supported, but which shows, spirit, and occasionally wins victories.

pirates about their business. We intend to do this whenever British
interests or British subjects, are, in danger; but for the rest, the
triangular duel must be fought out without our interference. It is
a pity, however, that the two decent parties do not coalesce, utterly
stamp out the Commune, and then settle matters by an appeal tº
the educated classes as to the form of Government. "Spain” is at
present what Italy was, a geographical expression. There is no such ||
nation.
The Conspiracy Bill was nearly the last business of this Session.
MR. HARCOURT's measure been expanded by the Government.
The Lords reduced it to its original form, and made it deal with
trade offences only. MR. HARcount refused to accept it in that
form, and so the measure is lost. The artisan class will infallibly
be told that they have a grievance here, and though practically
there will beenone, as sentences will be modified in view of what

Tuesdag—Some barrister, quoting. Latin in a court, pronounced
the word insiiper with a long vowel, insiper. A Judge said, “Mr.
DREARY, it is near the end of the term. Please do not make things
longer than necessary.” But here, on the very last day of the
Session, Ministers, s, and Commons were kept waiting for two
hours because nobody had taken thought to provide ial convey-
ance for the messenger from Osborne with the i. Mandate ;
Prorogation. This was inconvenient only for those in the House of
Lords. Everybody else had, thanks to the newspapers, which had
copies of the Message, and came out at the usual time, read the
document two hours before LoRD SELBoRNE was permitted to deliver
it in his “slightly melancholy” voice.
However, the order came at last, and the Message was given.
“As you have not heard its contents, I will now proceed to nar-
rate—”, “ In verse,” said Mr. Barlow. “But,” said, Master
Tommy, “I do not know-but perhaps Master Harry might, if you

If the words with which the leading Counsel for the defence, in a
case which has now occupied the Court of Queen's Bench for some
seventy days, closed his remarks on Thursday, the 7th inst, have
been correctly reported, the prospect of a termination to the T–e
trial seems more remote than ever—in fact there will never be an
end to it at all. MR. K—y is stated to have concluded his
address, on the day in question, by saying, “To-morrow we shall
go to ‘fresh fields and pastures new.’” That to-morrow will never
come, as the Judges, the Jury, the Counsel, the Officers of the
Court, and the parties interested in the case may satisfy them-
selves—with what feelings we will not presume to indicate—by
referring to the last line of MILTON's Lycidas. If it is not too
late, we earnestly hope that the records of the Court will be
amended, that the correct quotation may go down to posterity—
“To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.”

MR. (NOx has

Reformer. If Ma-

likewise against
nursemaids who
ropel along the

vehicles containing
their infant charges
- right ahead, whilst
they themselves are looking in another direction, and bruise the
legs or crush the toes of anybody in their way, beneath those not
small cars of Juggernaut, employers would mind how they sent
mooning hoydens into the street to incur fines, practically for them
to pay. - -
#. problem of combining the convenient airing of babies with
the security of adults' toes and shins might be solved by laying
down tramways in the streets, at the sides of the pavements, so that
the perambulators, with the infants in them, and their attendants
behind, might be wheeled by the latter in a line on the tramway,
one after another, clear of everybody, and marked off by a barrier
from the traffic of the thoroughfare, distinctly enough to be tolerably
safe from being run over. Now, whilst people are out of Town, the
“dead season” would be a convenient season for the introduction of
this improvement, which would certainly be hailed as a vast one by
everybody on coming back again.

CHAPTER THE LAST.
PISOATOR. WENATOR.
Piscator. And now, my loving Scholar
to an end, so must also my discourse. But, before we part, I will
remind you of the four ways of fishin which the learned jºkkºns
hath pronounced to be all most excellent; namely, to catch your
fish by dabbling, dibbling, dopping, or daping. For the first two,
the i. of silence must be strictly observed, for the same erudite
writer hath said,
When you dabble
Do not gabble.
And, also, -
When you dape
TNever gape.
So that to dabble should be an evening's occupation, while the latter
should be undertaken in the morning.

If you angle in the Ribble.
After dining on a º

Dabble, dibble, dop, and dape.
Using these
As you please,
Never will a fish escape.
Wenator. Q, Master, I could listen to your discourse for hours,
were I not still suffering from the stings of the wasps, the biting of
the jack, my fall into the river, the evening's potations, which have
induced me to be...somewhat ºf everish, and the hurt that I received
As to the great virtue of
left us this sage advice,—
fined twenty shil-
as your purse hath come
from that red cow in MAUDLIN's field, whither I strayed to tell her
of my affection for her and her mother.
Piscator, Nay, Scholar, you will soon be quit of these disorders,
and the time, so pleasantly spent in my company, with a
grateful and a thankful heart. And, to this end, I will repeat you
a copy of verses which DR. DooBRAIvorus, a worthy Bishop in
Belgravia, hath composed on the happiness and contentment of an
Angler's life. He has styled it, as also shall I, seeing no reason for
- so good a man,—
THE ANGLER'S DEEAM.
Listen to the Angler's dream!—
He dreams that he is by a stream,
Talking to a lovely Bream;
#. his side reclines a Carp,
Playing tunes upon a harp;
While a #.
Dressed inſalace
Sings the very deepest bass.
- the trees he sees a Perch
Kneeling in the village church,
Where the Reverend Mister Barbel,
In a pulpit made of marble,
Shows he can quotations garble.
Now, across the Mead, the Minnow,
Smiling sweetly, fresh and inno-
-cent a maiden as you’d see
In the waters of the sea,
Gomes a-tripping,
Comesa-skipping,
While thesly old #. and Grayling
Watch her, looking through the paling.
Then the Minnow meets a Skegger,
A. º º:
And he says, “My'little lass,
Payme, or you cannot pass.”
“Let me go!” she cries, in dudgeon,
When $º. Policeman Gudgeon,
Felling Skegger with a bludgeon.
Now Brave Gudgeon calls a coach,
Driven by a strong-backed Loach,
T the Skegger,
Boav Mºya,
Up before Chief Justice Roach.
Grubs and gentles
Leave their lentils,
Caterpillars
Quittheir villas,
And the grubs
Come out of tubs,
All to see the cheat and .
Who had only lived topoach,
Sentenced as a guilty Sk
By the Iord Chief Justice Roach.
Sticklebacks are on the Jury,
Counsel Pike is in a fury;
For the Judge, who wants to dine,
Cries, “Bring hither rod and line!
And that Angler by the stream,
Who is flirting with a Bream.
With the Skegger, by our laws,
He must sufferſ Through his jaws
Pass the hook! * him now
With the Skegger. Teach him how—
- Teachhimashe should be taught—
Teach the buffer
How weisuffer
By what he considers sport.”
Pass the hook!—a shooting pain—
And—he is awake again.
He has slept upon a bank
Whereareweeds and mosses dank,
And his face is very swollen:
Bodland can and bait all stolen."
“O!” he cries, “what joys are these !
I've rheumatics in the knees!
I've neuralgia in my cheeks!”
And—he i. up #: weeks.

he himself shall have no further use for it. But do not hanker after
money, whether it be a shilling, a sovereign, or a crown.

I think I shall now be able to become Master to some Scholar less

MERIGINE and Surgery have now something to say for themselves
as well as the other Sciences usually discursive about this time, an
they said it yery creditably last week, in comparatively few words,
ºf the secºnd annual meeting of the British Medical. Association, in
King's College, under the presidency of SIR. W. FERGusson. They
have ceased to hold their tongues, as they did in the days of one

“Scire potestates herbarum, usumque medendi

But, Iapis Iasides differs in more than one important particular
frºm the President of the British Medical Association. The word
inglorius,” even taken to imply no more than the obscurity of
private practice, is altogether inapplicable to that distinguished
Surgeon. Moreover, the address deſivered by SIR. W. FERGusson to
the doetors was by no means that of a man habitually wont to exer-
oise the silent arts. And, lastly, the said Iapis, on an emergency,
proved himself an inexpert operator; who could not even manage to
extract an arrow without supernatural-assistance. The contrast
‘need not be pursued.
To the student of LEMPRIkRE and the other Classics is suggested
an analogy rather between SIR W. FERGusson and Prometheus. If
the latter provided mankind with fire from the sky, the former,
through his Presidential oration, has reminded the British Public
of the facility with which we might supply ourselves, from the
same source, with a sufficiency of that great hygienic and ºthera-
peutic necessary, water.

Where I lately in luxury dined,

And the gatekeeper grins when I go.

Seasonable Occurrence.
THE late hotweather has been attended with several
cases of sun-stroke, in one of which, that of a young
lady, the brain was umaffected, but the chignon took fire,
the sun's rays co-operating with internal heat to produce
what is erroneously called spontaneous combustion. Con-
sidering the magnitude of the ricks which girls con-
tinueto wear ion their heads, the wonder is that cases
of this kind are not more frequent.
*LIBERTY
Confusion of Ideas.
MRs. MALAPROP, who is both an excellent Protestant
and an indefatigable gardener, is evidently.jumbling
up two distinct and separate things. In writing to a
friend at the sea-side, she expresses her horror of “Au-
ricula” confession.
THE LINE
Hear DR. John Wood, Professor of Surgery in King's College, on
an American improvement in the way of performing painless
operations:-
“We followed but tardily, in this old country, in that combination of
pleasure with utility which had led lately the inventive genius of our trans-
atlantic brethren to the association of anaesthetics in the performance of opera-
tions under these agents to an obbligato accompaniment upon the organ, and
an appropriate address by a popular preacher, improving the occasion on
...hº"of morals.”
Perhaps it would be found, in many instances, that an appro-
priate address by a popular preacher would alone produce a state of
coma deep enough to render any physical anaesthetic unnecessary;
thus effectually obviating the danger of using chloroform.
The appearance ºf the PREMIER in the quality of guest at the
Association Dinner in Lincoln’s-inn Hall, and his very remarkable
response to the toast, admirably proposed by SIR JAMES PAGET, of
“Her Majesty's Ministers,” are symptomaticofanincreasing apprecia-
tion of . M. Frofession. y, MR. GLADSTONE, says
he is indebted to it for keeping him up to the mark." Mr. Punch
will not be at all astonished by the speedy announcement that SIR
W. F. and SIR J. P. are about to be raised to the Peerage.
Beward of Spirit.
TEFERRING to MR. BAXTER's . tion of the office of Secretary
to the Treasury, the Times observed:– -
“Take a brick out of a walland the whole structure may tumble down."
Then MR. BAxTER is a brick; and a high compliment has been
paid to MR. BAxTER. |

ONE day last week a tele from Berlin announced that on the
following Sunday, at Stromberg, near Kreuznach, would be held an
Ultramontane demonstration, arranged by Bishop KETTELER's
Catholic Association of Mayence. Will the Prussian Government
stand an Ultramontane ODGERP Probably not, if BISMARCK knows
it, and has, at present, any voice in the matter. Bishop KETTELER
should take care, for he materially differs from a kettle, in relation
to its contents, the kettle remaining outside of hot water, whereas
the Bishop appears to be adopting a course very likely indeed to get
himself into it.
THYESTES REDIWIWUS.
WE had hoped that, the siege of Paris having long been over, any
eccentricities in the matter of eating would have ceased with the
necessity which introduced them. But we regret to find that canni-
bal practices still “obtain” in the capital of civilisation. After the
distribution of prizes, the other day, at the Sorbonne—
“In the evening, the Minister gave a grand dinner of fifty-two covers,
consisting of all the Directors of the Colleges of Paris, the examiners who
had .. on the compositions, and the pupils who had obtained the
Prizes of Honour.”
Well, as somebody (we may as well say SYDNEY SMITH as anybody
else) said to a quarrelsome missionary, just going out, “I hope you
| will disagree with the man that eats you.” Let us hope that
M. BATBIE and his friends had dreadful nightmares after this
banquet of Thyestes.

It is known that Convocation, before it separated, had received

in reply, informed the petitioners that they could have plenty of

of advertisement that would recommend itself to some

thing may be seen everywhere, and that everybody has
it, and, like the MULLIGAN, when you askfor an address,
say, “Q, out there.” Very well, preach a better sermon
yourself on the evident misplacement of three words.
Flippant Fair Ones.
PROFEssoR REINKENs has been consecrated Missionary
Bishop for the Old Catholics of Germany by Bishop
HEYKAMP, of Deventer, and assistants. The priest
RINKEL, of Krommenie, has likewise been consecrated
Bishop of Haarlem. Thus the Old Catholics seem to be
successfully, organising themselves in Germany, and
Holland. Are they likely to increase and i.
That remains to be seen; but, in the meanwhile, there
are a great many silly girls who say that they never will
marry an Old Catholic.
Such Fantastic Tricks.
HIs Holin Ess says, that “what men do in the way of
pilgrimage is done in the sight of the angels.” , Pope
SHAKSPEARE said it before Pope PIUs, with an addition
about men doing certain things that make the angels
use their pocket-handkerchiefs.

FIVE Grocers in Dunmow have been fined for serving
out objectionable Butter. Why have there been, no
proceedings, then, against the speakers who eulogised
the candidates for the Dunmow Flitch?

PUNCH*S MUSICAL SERMON.
(With Two Terts.)
MR. PUNCH has not had much to say about Music lately, and for
a reason sufficing to himself, and therefore sufficient for mankind.
For when Punch is content the world is at peace. The fact is that
the Music-Crops have been bad this year, and the yield next to
nothing. The SHAH prevented the production of BALFE's Opera,
Il Talismano, and thus deferred another victory for Admirable
NILsso N.; but we trust that, like her namesake, ADMIRAL NELsoN,
she will defeat the combined forces of the Continent next season,
and win new glories for the British flag. TITIENs, and PATTI have
been singing like—TITIENs and PATTI; none but themselves can be
their els; which quotation doesn't hold, because parallels
never meet, and those ladies have met very often, to their mutual
delight. M. FAURE has done everything like the true artist that he
is, and we praise Apollo for hi MADAME ARABELLA Gonpah.D has
ſº to see the Southern Cross—let the enchanted Australians give
er one in diamonds. Lesser §: have shone their brightest.
But we have had no novelty, and Mr. Punch has no space to tell a
hundred times told tales. There are two matters, however, to
which he proposes to invite attention. And, first, he begs, or rather
takes leave to ask a question. Where is your English MozART,
WEBER, MEDDLEsoME (as MRS., MALAPROP calls him), BACK (as
MRs. MALAPROP spells him), and AUBER P. If we paused for a reply,
we should wait some time. But it may be that we should not have
to wait so long, if §. bestowed more pains on the musical
education of her children. Latent genius might be developed.
Very, well, go to. , That is, go to the Treasurers for two most
excellent projects which be now in hand. Go to the Bank of Eng-
land, Western Branch, and #. in a donation to the Mendelssohn
Scholarships Foundation, which has been doing exceeding good
work, but which, we regret to hear from MR. OTTo GoLosch MIDT,
is much crippied for want of funds. This is simply a shame, for
MENDELssoRN's music commends itself to those whose gold makes
merry music in their pockets. “Heaven save the Foundation!” as
Dogberry observes, and let us help in the process. Why, ARTHUR
SUILIVAN was the very first scholar elected by this Institution, and
if that fact be not reason for encouraging and supporting it, we know
nothing about facts or reasons either. Well, hand in your money;
Then write a letter to a Lady who has most honourably distinguished
herself by her services to Music, we mean LADY JENKINson, of
Eastwood Park, Gloucestershire, and enclose §. cheque, or your
P.O.O., towards another Foundation, that of a Thalberg Scholars º:
to be attached to the Royal Academy (not our dear, friends the
Painters; they roll in gold, and might give us more dinners), but
of Music. This Scholarship is to be the reward of “the best
executant of the best sort of Music.” Now, don't be absurd. If
England is to be a musical nation, it will not be by gushing, or by
merely paying vast sums to finished artists, but by educating her
own musical youth. There is sound sense in both these efforts, or
Mr. Punch would not have devoted his precious intellect to eulogis-
ing them. Having obeyed his commands, enjoy your holidays.
But, if you neglect the mandate, may the pianofortes in the houses
right and left of you be bumped from morning to night by the most
stupid and unteachable girls that ever banged a ºš.
Hopeful.
M. HENRI ROCHFORT has been sent to New Caledonia. If it's
*...* like Old Caledonia, there's a fair chance of his coming
“Bock agen.” By the way, as a conundrum, when M. RochFort
once more sits on the Boulevards, with his modest glass of malt
liquor before him, what, in Old Caledonian language, will he say?
Evidently (vide supra) “Bock agen.”
Twixt two Latin Races small difference is plain;
There’s fusion in France, and confusion in Spain.

unwilling recruit, is 'held

murderous assault, or the
sufferer of punishment for
robbery with violence, or the
subject of an accident, bleeds
- Fº against his will.
ut there is a sort of invo-
luntary bleeding to which,
however, Britons are liable.
The other day, in the course
of that great trial, the ex-
ample of our Law's despatch,
which the civilised world is
beholding with admiration,
at the conclusion of that
day's proceedings, according to a contemporary:—
“The Juryman who fainted during the early progress of the trial, and who
looked exceedingly ill, said he could not sit longer. He was anxious to have
the case finished, łº, he was losing £20 a week by it, but he could not sit
more hours a day.”
Now this gentleman is bleeding at the pocket, besides as bad as
bleeding bodily from a wound, in his country's service. He bleeds,
in the compulsory office of juror, for the ºistration of justice.
He is losing twenty pounds, so to speak, of pecuniary vital fluid a
week. The accused, on whose indictment he has to pronounce a
verdict, is prosecuted at the public expense. Will not the Govern-
ment, then, indemnify the Juryman for his loss of blood, and, should
he die, as he may, of too protracted, fair argument and scrupulous
eloquence, will they not compensate his survivors, in some measure,
for his loss? Perhaps yes, now that the PREMIER is also Chancellor
of the Exchequer.
No doubt there are numerous Patriots ready to exclaim, “Perish
individuals for the good of the community! tter that a Juryman
should go on losing £20 a week, even until he is ruined, than that
he should be reimbursed with E.; money, to which, in the end,
I should have to contribute a fraction of a farthing.” Nobody who
hates and despises a selfish, unjust, mean brute, can wish anyone of
those Patriots worse luck t to get impressed upon such a jury as
that which has been sitting so long as it has, and is likely to have to
sit so much longer than that, listening to terse and condensed, but
necessarily lengthy, argumentation in the Court of Queen's Bench.

“Half an hour with Seaweeds.”—This cannot be looked upon as
an exorbitant demand on your spare time. And yet there are care-
less and unobservant persons for whom it may be more than enough.
As the poet says,
“A sea-weed by the ocean brim
Is but a sea-weed unto him!”
“Half an hour with Sponges.”—Of course, if your medical man
(or woman) prohibits you from sea-bathing, you must have your
bath at home in your lodgings, and pay for it.
“Half an hour with Sea-Worms.”—We should have preferred
.. about which interesting group of animals, our author,
strangely enough, a rs to be silent.
“Half an hour with Corallines.”—At the end of which period of
time you will know and be able to impart to your friends still steeped
in the lap of ignorance, the exact difference, specifically and generi-
cally, between corals and corallines.
“Half an hour with the Jelly-fish.”—If you can get any fish at
all where you are † and it is not all sent away in the early, early
morning to London and other greatly over-peopled centres of popu-
lation, you will probably feel that your time may be more agreeably
spent in the society of the turbot, the sole, the smelt, the whiting,
and the haddock. -
“Half an hour with Sea-Anemones.”—The Aquarium you are
contemplating in the back yard of No. 58, Lower Tankerville Street,
will induce you not to lose a moment of this particularly precious
half-hour.
“Half an hour with Sea-Mats and Squirts.” Possibly important
links in that great chain of development the termination of which is
said to be Man, in a black hat and upright shirt-collar; and, there-
fore, as our distant relations, deserving some notice and attention.
Otherwise, not personally attractive.
“Half an hour with Sea-Urchins and Starfish.” You love chil-
dren and all their pranks and sports. So many a pleasant half hour
is in store for you, watching your own and other people's sea
“urchins,” splashing and dancing in the water, and digging and
jºins on the beach. (For tº: on. starfish, see ante, Jelly-

he does not believe that the blinded Papists gave no more than two-

24 per cent. be meant, it is a very mean contribution, considering

A PLANO-TAX WANTED.
SYMPATHISING MR. PUNCH,
WE are to be blest with a new tax-maker, or Chancellor of
the Exchequer, and the blessing of mew taxes we may naturall
expect. A Cat-tax and a Croquet-tax have been, I think, propose
in high financial quarters, as being novelties of †: pecuniary
promise; and I rather fancy that a tax upon old bachelors has
already found some favour in the eyes of the fair sex. These im-
posts would, however, º immensely less productive than the one
which I suggest in the heading of this letter, and which few persons
of any sense would venture to oppose.
It may seem to some young ladies a vastly cruel thing to clap a
tax on one of their first necessaries of life. But Alpha's meat, you
know, may turn out Beta's poison: and to my mind a piano, far
from being needful to existence, is pre-eminently hurtful, and may
indeed prove wellnigh fatal to it." In the dictionary a piano is
desi simply an instrument of music; but in the hands of
most performers it may rather be described as an instrument of
torture, capable of causing most excruciating agony on persons like
myself, who are sensitive of nerve. So direful are its torments, I
can conceive one's even putting a pistol to one's ear, to relieve it
from the torture a piano is inflicting on it.
This I say in all sincerity, for my sufferings at this moment are so
terribly intense, that I feel I should be sitting on the very brink of
suicide, had Iany lethal weapon larger than a penknife, lying ready
to my . To enjoy some needful rest after the labours of the
season, I have taken quiet º: at a so-famed quiet watering-
lace; and while I am tranquilly º: in writing at the win-
ow, the jangling wires of six pianos are hammered in my ears. As
compared with the large rent I pay, the room is rather small, and
for fear of suffocation I dare not #: the window; indeed, were I
to do so, I should not escape the torture, for two of my tormentors
are at work beneath my feet. -
A third, moreover, sits next door, and her instrument is placed
ainst the wall of my apartment, which tremulously vibrates to
the thunder of her thumbs. I make use of this expression to give
you some idea of the vigour of her playing. This at times is so
tremendous that I hardly can conceive her having any little fingers;
indeed, I should imagine that her fingers are all thumbs.
To add to my discomfort, through the window comes a clamour of
commingled jingle-jangling, which tells me my tormentors hem me
round on every side. me of them are singing, too, which makes
the torture worse, and I am maddened by the sound of hackneyed
operatic fragments, mixed up with vulgar fractions of music-hall-
marked songs. -
If you try, a quiet watering-place, you will probably experience
the same suffering as mine, and will agree with me in thinking that
pianos should be taxed. A heavy impost, should be laid on every
instrument in use, and every performer should take out a playing
licence, for which a handsome price should be demanded by the
State. The strumming of pianos is worthy to be classed .#
those noxious occupations which are tolerated only in some specifie
localities, and are put under heavy penalties lest they affect the
public health.
Believe me yours, in martyrdom,

P.S.. I think the tax might well be doubled to any one who prac-
tises with the window open.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
After a Visit to the Isle of Wight, reports thereupon to the Editor.
f Suggestions to º Yachtists.
RULY, Sir, I have been re-
- presenti you, nauti-
ºf cally, and you did not
== know it. No || Like one
- of “the gentlemen of
e--
England who live at home
at ease,” you were reclin-
ing in the old arm-chair
in the chimney corner, of
course with the fire out,
and only in order to get
a draught of fresh air
from the chimney itself,
—you, I say, were thus
reclining, littlewotting or
(to sound nautically) little
(“spell it with a
w, my Lord”) of the
dangers which Your Re-
presentative was incur-
ring 'twixt Southsea and
Cowes. -
Belay, you land lub-
bers!”Tº in Stokes’
Bay, or, to be accurate,
'twas off the Southsea pier,
I waved a sorrowful adieu
to the Poll of my heart,
and bade a long farewell to the shores of Qld England, intending
to remain in the Isle of Wight from, at all events, Friday after-
noon till Monday morning. TA brisk breeze , the k-
ling waves danced with joy, as, answering to her helm, the Saucy
(I forget her name) bared her snowy bosom to the sun, and, swan-
like, glided o'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea.
I write, observe, in a poetic vein; for the craft was a steamer,
without sails, and singularly grubby for such a spick-and-span place
as she was bound for. As to that epithet of LoRD BYRON's, “The
Dark-Blue Sea,” he evidently refers to the See of Oxford, the only
one whose colour is, legitimately, dark blue. But, avast jesting,
my messmates! and, in #: wº Yeo hol
§ had gathered, from information had received, that Cowes was
en fête, and therefore, as Your Representative, I was dressed accord-
ingly. Splice your old timbers! it would have done good to the
#. º your heart of oak to have seen me in a straw hat, real
Panama, purchased in Germany, and warranted to be folded up and
stowed away in your waistcoat pocket, a blue blouse, a bright sunset
evening tie, un º a striped turn-down collar, while below. I
was en in a pair of ducks white as the riven snow, taut at the
top, but large and loose at the point where they fall over the shoe.
(This is, perhaps, a lengthy description, but º its delicacy,
which resembles that of the excellent maiden lady who would not
pronounce the word “Rotterdam” on account of its improper termi-
*... * admit that if it be lengthy, it is, at least, not so broad as
it is long.
As we neared Cowes we passed through, a fleet of yachts, and
Your Representative went aloft, that is stood up, and kept a bright
lookout, in the hopes of ...ºf some one on board one of these
aristocratic craft who woul il him with a cheery “Ahoy!
Messmatel” and ask him to come off to dinner. I daresay there
were several doing this in the distance, but, as we sped along, my
eye, unaided, was not arrested by any festive signals, nor did either
six bells, or two guns, announce the preparations for dinner. -
By the time I had got my sea legs on, I had to get ’em off again
and walk ashore. I #. arrived on the night of R.Y.S. Ball, and a
queue of amateur tars were awaiting their turn at the hairdresser's,
who, on this sultry day, was melting under the heavy work, like
his own pomatum before a fire. - -
After my sea-voyage, I too wanted renovating with mechanical
brushing, and the grateful shampoo, without which I foresaw I
should not enjoy my dinner. Shampoo first, Champagne after-
wards. However, I could not be attended to for at least an hour,
so I wandered forth into the town, and H. in the first place be-
fore a shop-window which reflected me like a pier-glass. autical
jeu de mot. No gentleman staying at the sea-side perfect without a
pier-glass. This is the effect of the briny breezes on Your Repre-
sentative.)
I was astonished. My noble Panama, once the pride of a fashion-
able watering-place in Germany, by constant foldings and frequent
battlings with the stormy winds, had got hopelessly out of sha
There let me warn my readers against a Panama, except, only for
domestic wear, where nobody’s looking. A Panama, price about
four guineas, is generally recommended as “a hat, Sir, that'll last
}. your lifetime.” , Quite so: it will, and a precious bore it
ecomes. Fashions change, but there's your Panama, always the
same. No, not always, for having bought it for its “portability”
everything “ º: e” is, generally speaking, a mistake), you have
equently folded it up and stowed it away, in order to prove to
your friends what a valuable acquisition your new purchase is, and
thus whatever shape it might have had to start with, has been clean
taken out of it. This results in “blocking and cleaning”—a process
which will cost about four guineas more, per annum. So, on the
whole, if the hat does last your lifetime, as it undoubtedly will
unless you destroy it, or lose it, you will bequeath a valuable heirloom
to your family, Say lº purchase it when you are thirty, and live
till, seventy, then the original cost being four guineas, and
“blocking and cleaning” four more per annum, we get a total of
about a hundred and seventy-two pounds, which represents the cost
of the Panama hat at the time of your lamented decease.
* Costume at the sea-side is everything, especially at Cowes," where
you are nothing unless nautical; or, rather, as that's too much of a
rough sea-doggy word, I should say yachtical. In Cowes the toy-
shops are generally of a marine turn—toy sailors, dolls in F.
costume, boats of all sizes, cutters, yawls, and luggers. notice
a. brightly-painted Noah's ark on a shelf, in dock, as it were, being
as much out of date as NELSoN's flag-ship among the ironclads.
Shops haying professionally nothing of a nautical character about
them, go in for it by *.*. up a picture of a fearful wreck.
As for the tailors, the haberdashers, bootmakers, and the linen-
drapers, they display in every available space blue cloth, straw hats
with names of yachts on theribands, deck shoes, and sailor costumes
for ladies. Skippers meet you at every turn, as do also first and
second mates with sailors carrying provision-baskets. The conver-
sation everywhere is about yachting: which won what, what came
in when, and yº other didn't this time but would next, and so
on. Guns at ; Somebody told me that they fired at the sun as
it went down behind the horizon; which seemed a puerile sport... I
am more inclined to believe that it was intended, not as a shot at the
great lumi , but as a parting salute on his retiring for the evening.
The gen idea conveyed by the appearance of Cowes to the
mind of Your Representative was that a naval engagement was
going on somewhere, perhaps in “the Roads” (absurd place, of
course, for a naval engagement), and that the reserves were making
the best of “ten minutes allowed for refreshment,” on the island,
before joining the battle.
But the great thing at Cowes is to master the difficulty of “ How
to look like it.”
First, two weeks as a regular Yachtsman of the R.Y.S. evidently
means ten thousand a year, at least. But how does little Tom
TUPPENNY manage to do it on his three or four hundred per annum
at most P Why, he has mastered the secret of “how to look like it.”
And this is it for Cowes; dress in yachting costume, ready, as it
were, for action. If you know anyone with a yacht, and you can
get an invitation, do so, of course; only in this case, mind, you
must have no name on the hat-riband. If you have no yachting
acquaintance, look over the list of yachts, and buy a riband with a
name that isn't in the Catalogue.
This will give, you an opportunity of spinning a yarn about
“Confound it, 'bliged to put into dock. Just off for Sweden. Aii
hands to pump. Had to put back,” &c. Or you can use strong
language about your “Confounded Captain, who always will mistake
your sailing orders, and who ought to have met you at Cowes.”
Secondly, the purchase of a telescope (one second-hand, and
utterly out of order, can be fº for a mere trifle) is a necessity, as,
whenever there’s nothing else to be done at Cowes, the rule is to
look through a glass of some sort, if a telescope, so much the better.
The object is unimportant; but, if you must have one as a subject
of conversation, you can always be on the look out for your boat, or
for your confounded Captain (call him CAPTAIN HARRIs), who won't
be punctual, hang himſ and whom youintend, you can say severely,
to dismiss the instant he arrives.
. This method of “looking like it” will only cost you your ordin
ving, and with a trip or two, on the steamboat round the islan
and over to Southampton and Portsmouth (always, of course, in
search of your missing idiotic Captain—for you must keep up the
character), you’ll have had most of the pleasure of yachting with-
out any of the expense or bother *f to yacht-ownership.
propos of “ownership,” a nauticaljeu de mot (and it’s just as well
to have these things rea : would be that the possession of a Yacht
can't be properly described as Own-a-ship.
Also, with perfect truth, anyone who follows the above directions
will be able to say to a landsman, “Ah, my boy!, there’s a heap of
pleasure to be got out of a yacht!”—and you will make a mental
reservation to the effect that whatever nautical pleasure you had at
Cowes, you did get out of a yacht, and not in it.
But, avast heaving ! or, my worthy Skipper, you’ll be overhauling

PILGRIMS AND PHILOSOPHERS.
Among the wonders of this scientific age, one of the greatest,
º: is the fact that people who live in it should, any of them,
e so stupid and superstitious as to go on such a fool's errand as a
§". to Paray-le-Monial, in honour of MARIE ALAcoquE.
Such folly, and superstition may well be deemed, as the Times
observes, “sufficiently astonishing even in France.” The Times
continues:-
“But what are we to say of the spread of such fanaticism in England? A
band of pilgrims, with the benediction of the ARchbishop of WESTMINstER
and his episcopal brethren, are to set out next month for the shrine of Paray-
le-Monial, in France. The Duke of Norfolk will go with it as its leading
member, and LoRD WALTER KERR will act as Secretary to the undertaking.’
It is rather difficult to think what to say of the enterprise con-
templated by His Grace and His Lordship. The Times may be
right in arguing that—
. “Superstition... is still a great force, and a considerable part of the popula:
tion of Europe, are, so far as relates to religious matters, no more enlightened
than they were five hundred years ago. It may be said that the spectacle of
similar fanaticism in a higher class in Eºshows that education gives no
guarantee against such rela But the two cases are probably very differ-
ent in character. In England there is no chance whatever of such follies
spreading, and they are rather the fancies of the over-cultivated than the
beliefs of the ignorant.”
Possibly. But before adopting that supposition to account for a
proceeding which, on theface of it, indicates parity as to intelligence
and enlightenment with French peasants, one would like to see the
Noblemen who meditate it cross-examined in a witness-box. Per-
haps the place where they received their education was either that
celebrated institution, or some other such reputable seat of learning—
Stonyhurst.

TOO LATE FOR THE SHAH.
OF course his Persian Majesty the SHAH reads the Morning Post.
That journal has probably given him cause, in the subjoined para-

ºnly of witnessing a sight which would have interested
“The Right Hon. Robert Lowe attended at the Home Office yesterday
for the first time since his appointment as Secretary of State for the Home
...and, as is customary, the several heads of the Office were pre-
sen to him.”
The successor of DARTUs and numerous other despotsis, doubtless,
aware that the Law of England is now, according to Act of Parlia-
ment, always Finished in private. Perhaps, however, he does not
also know that decapitatiºn is no longer a of the punishment
for high treason. Wery º: therefore, when he read, or had read
to him by an interpreter, the foregoing announcement, the idea
occurred to him that the heads of the Office presented to MR. Lowe,
on entering upon the exercise of his functions as Home Secretary,
were those of former officials, who had turned traitors and been
brought to the block. Under that impression, he would naturally
regret that he had not remained here long enough to have been
enabled, by ial invitation, to be present at a spectacle which
familiarity with it is not supposed to prevent an Oriental Monarch
from always §: We had no Hanging Gardens to show him
but, he may think, we had a Home Office, within whose walls, had
he stopped with us a little longer, he might have beheld a sight
which would have been equivalent to the view afforded by that kind
of pleasure-ground.

THE SUFFRAGE FOR THE SWAINS.

And grantun' um emancipation
As wide as the breezy South Downs.
No need to fly into a panic;
No fear of increasun' mob rule:

which on 'um's most fur from a fool?
Suppose they be both fools together,
s their words and their acts both denotes,
Why then the plain question is whether
Both bain't *. fit to ha' votes?
The greatest o' pains has been taken
They shall vote as can'trade, write, nor spell;
Then why not allow a chawbacon
To tender a fool's vote as well?
But no man s with his brother,
Whose life is a different lot,
One fool, though as as another,
His own sart o' folly ha’ got.
So one's vote the t'other's opposes,
And that’s the defence of the plan
Of sufferidge by “countun o' noses”;
O' Chelsea to quoat the Wise Man.
The more, under that there condition,
The better the noses, for me,
I thinks I could zign a petition
For Earlswood to vote wi'the Free.
And then, if so be we admitted
Asylums, we med as well schools,
To be all the moor benefitted
By havin' fools vote agen fools.
Leastways, as the materal purtectors,
And gardjuns o' them that we loves,
We ought to make all them electors,
Our darluns, our ducks, and our doves.
To poll we shall soon dance so gaily,
Together, both faymales and men;

THE Inverness Courier, remarking upon MR. Bryce's
taking the title of LoBD ABERDARE, suggests that LoBD
NEVERDARE might have been as apposite. 'Tis neat.
But, anyhow, his Lordship went to the last Mansion

he subjoins a Blue passage from a late Leamington Chronicle. A
certain concert was described, and this tribute was borne to the

“Miss EDITH WYNNE is the TrrieNs of the saloon, and sang with her

We do not say that this is bad musical criticism, as times go, but
on the whole we should prefer a somewhat “nicer derangement of
epitaphs.”
The Official Paradise.
WHEN the Right Honourable and Amiable Gentleman, who was
President of the Board of Works, and is Judge-Advocate-General,
first entered on the duties of his former office, he made, it will be
recollected, a speech, wherein, amongst other negative qualifications
for the performance of them, the advantage of being no market-
gardener was one which he claimed credit for. In the capacity, to
use a questionable expression, which MR. AYRTON has vacated, # is
succeeded by MR. ADAM. If worthy of his name, whether he prove
to be an ile or no, ADAM will at any rate be a gardener.

Butler! Are the advertisers Teetotallers? (Bless the slang !). If
so, they do not want a Butler. But do they partake of the glorious
juice of the grape, given by kind Providence to make glad the heart
of man? so, why a Teetotal Butler? Is it not that official's
business to know about his wines, and to advise his master?
And ought he not to take care that no bottle he produces is corked?
We should as soon en a Wegetarian Cook as a Teetotal Butler.
The fact is, that the abstaining fanaticism means water on the
brain, and hence idiotcy.
A Great Deal in a Name.
DISTINCTIONs are always invidious, and to be avoided. In “the
Intelligence Department of the Army” there would seem to lurk an
implication, which terror of the new Judge Advocate-General and
his powers forbids us indicating more definitely. Is it too late to
select a less obtrusive title for this new Department? Besides, the

thoroughly understand.
INSTEAD OF THE SEA.
Do not be despairing, if financial or other obstacles compel you to
relinquish your intention of visiting the sea-side this Autumn. By
the exercise of a little ingenuity you may, though you never stir
out of London, secure most if not all of the pleasures and advantages
which Breezegate or Gayborough can offer, without the expenses,
inconveniences, and drawbacks, which past . has taught
you to associate with a temporary residence in those Marine Elysia.
All you require is a few hints how to proceed. Here they are, care-
fully selected.
Saline bathing the first thing in the morning has been recom-
mended you. Some “Sea Salt” in your own comfortable bath, in
your own snug bed-room, will enable you to follow * medical
adviser's directions to the letter, and spare you much you would
have to go through at Shingleton—the premature rising to be in
time for some §º. condition of the tide; the hasty equipment,
: hurried walk, the bathing caravan, and all its damping circum-
stances.
The simple addition of a dish of shrimps, or the more refined
prawns, to your breakfast-table, will at once put you on a par with
your more affluent brother-in-law at Jetby.
Your morning promenade is a very obvious arrangement. Where-
ever you may live, be it in the North at Islington, or in the South
at Stockwell, in the East at Hackney, or the West at Fº you
can easily, speedily, and cheaply reach the Strand. you are
inclined to extend your ramble, at the proper time (any almanack
or calendar will tell you the exact hour ºminute), you may take
your stand on London Bridge, and there, in your º suit and
straw hat, and sand shoes, wait for high water. Should the day be
windy, it will be an agreeable variety to return by the Embank-
ment, and watch the yeasty waves foaming in the wake of the
steam-vessels and other craft navigating the waters of our great
tidal stream.
And now, with heightened colour and sharpened appetite, you are
ready for the fish dinner which can always be obtained in London
but is not so invariably to be depended upon by the occupants of
furnished lodgings at #. guineas and a half a week (kitchen fire,
gas, boot-cleaning, the use of plate and linen, and attendance,
extra), at Quayside or Algathorpe.
As the day wears on, books will form a pleasant resource. The
observation of an eminent naturalist that fish, as an article of food
is beneficial to the brain, will come home to you with redoubled
force, when you find your appreciation of GEORGEs SAND, or CRABBE,
or SHELLEY, or some other old-established favourite (Spºt now-
a-days nobody reads—he is quite out of season), keener than ever
after your finny meal.
Music will be instrumental in helping you to while away the
twilight hours.” As you listen to or take a part in By the Sad Sea
Waves, The Minute Gun at Sea, The Sands of Dee, What are the
Wild Waves Saying £ and other nautical ballads and concerted
pieces, the last trace of envy of BARWYSE at Charmouth, or STEEL-
MAN at Llanynlleth, will #. away into the peaceful evening.
A lobster, with or without salad, will be the fitting close to a
well-spent day; and if you seek your bed a little earlier than
usual (No-I think I would not e a Cockle), you will only be
following the example, of. LOTHRERRY, gaping simultaneously, at
Fernycombe, or your old friend, MARK MINCING, yawning, with a
candlestick in his hand, the self-same hour, at Dawdlish.
Insufficiently Armed.
OUR attention has been drawn to a paragraph headed “New Arm
for American Cavalry.” Up to this moment we were ignorant that
horse soldiers in the United States had not the proper equipment of
members; and we can but rejoice that so serious a deficiency is
about to be made good— º by one of those mechanical con-
trivances in which our T.º. brethren are known to excel.
We ºlude that it is not the sword arm American troopers have

SOCIAL SCIENCE AND SMOKE.
PERHAPs some competent member of the Social Science Association
will, with a view to a paper for their approaching Congress, make a
note of the following extract from the Times:–
“ToBAcco.—Smoking is greatly on the increase, as appears from an
official paper just issued. In the last seven months the declared value of
unmanufactured tobacco imported was 1,068,201 lb., against 623,588 lb. in the
corresponding period of the previous year.”
Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Penus. From Baccho the transition
by phonetic impulse to tobacco is natural, and suggests the question
whether the increase of smoking has had the #. of increasing
the marriage-rate?
Tobacco is not the same with Baccho in its properties, and it is
very different from bread. Statistics show that a fall of bread
always coincides with a rise of matrimony. This fact illustrates
the providence of the Masses; when b falls they immediately
marry, calculating that it will never rise again. At the same time
they purchase more tobacco. With them the fragrant weed is not
avourable to the tender º But amongst the poorer middle
and comparatively less wealthy of the upper classes, a young man
in love is now by no means the common *... that he used to
be. On the contrary, the goose has become a black swan, and, in
the meanwhile, the consumption of tobacco has evidently increased,
i. amongst middle and upper class yo men. Tobacco
ys gravings; it may allay the cravings of affection. Smoking is
a practice conducive to philosophical serenity, and exclusive of sen-
timental emotion; now the love which actuates the better orders,
when they give way to it, is specifically sentimental. As a powerful
aid to reflection, smoking disposes youth to calculate consequences;
thus tending to co-operate, in relation to love and matrimony, with
the difficulty of obtaining decent employment and with the high
price of provisions. And, certainly, it is now very seldom that a
poor young gentleman enrages and grieves his anxious parents by
marrying a girl without a penny.
..You want statistical returns of the comparative consumption of
bird's-eye, Hav cigars, and the rest of the higher c to-
baccos. Also a numerical comparison of the average of “Mar-
riages” in the Times yearly for a series of years. This information
would require taking some trouble to get it, but that, to avotary of
Social Science, would be a labour of love. In conducting this im;
portant and interesting inquiry, there is one point which should
not fail to receive, due investigation: Care should be taken to
ascertain, if possible, to what extent the habit of ..f prevails,
and the rate at which it has increased from a given period of recent
date, amongst young ladies.
Sport and Saying.
A PHRASE once much in vogue to express excellence was “This
beats cock-fighting.” Good phrases are, and ever were commend-
able, but, cock-fighting is now illegal, because it is thought cruel.
We could, however, still say, “This beats pigeon-shooting.”

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(Something more about the Isle of Wight.)
SIR, Your Representative,

the R. Y. S. Club-house, known as N. Castle.” He is civil; not.
too civil, and reckons you up in notime. This is very clever on his
part, as he neverlooks at you while talking, being always occupied
with conning something in the offing throughia
me that he is so accustomed to this as to be unable to see without it
and that consequently he had º; me a long way off, and had
reckoned up the full importance of Elvira on my hat.
However, the value of a chat with him is, that, at no expense,
unless you suggest a glass of wine (he is too great a swell for beer),
§. can pass in the º of the admiring public for a member of the
lub in whose grounds you are standing. After this, you can walk
with a prouder air. Should the Signalman be your only acquaint-
ance, and you are not on speaking terms with members of the Royal
Family, or º of the noblemen and titled gentry, your time (this to
the reader) will hang a bit heavy on your s, and I advise you,
as you value your holiday, to take the steamer for Ryde; for, after
all, you are lost at Cowes; Ryde is the better place of the two, and
from Ryde you can go anywhere by coast, train, or boat, which you
can't from Cowes. Your Representative was much struck by the
smallness of the Island, and everything in it. The whole thing is a
toy: The Tramway, to begin, with, is a toy, brightly coloured,
with a meat conductor. The little Railway_Station is a toy; so’s
the miniature train, which should be wound, up and go by clock-
work instead of steam. Then the hills, and the º and the
bridge, and the little people walking about, and the little shops and
the little shopkeepers, toys, every one of them, and the whole
flºº. be stowed away with much neatness and precision in a
few boxes such as the Germans make for toy-packing. Shanklin
is just what you’ll see in one of the toyshop windows in Regent
Street, only that when Your Representative visited it the Water-
fall hadn't been wound up, and nothing was playing a tune. This
was unfair, as I had to pay eighteenpence for seeing this Shanklin
toy. That one-and-six at the f* and the way it was got out of
me, quite spoiled the romance of a stroll through Shanklin Chine.
You wander on under overhanging trees, and by the side of
glistening rocks, you shudder at the depth below, and you e
enraptured at the glimpse of blue sky through the fretwork of foliº
age above, and you soliloquise aloud or to lº. I reached that
poetic point when one feels inclined (as I felt representing You, Sir),
to pour forth my whole soul in some sympathetic ear; and at this
minute my eye lighted upon a young and lovely brunette standin
ensively by a rustic bri * gazing out toward the sea; I paused,
or not by a footfall would I have disturbed her meditation.
However, she had caught the sound of my fairy-like step (I was
weighed the other day, and am able on authority to correct the
report about my walking fourteen stone in my boots), and, sighing
gently, she turned her head towards me.
I approached the Bridge, and, with that courtliness which distin-
guishes any one, Sir, who represents You as You ought to be repre-
sented (a Pºiº generally flatters the original), I raised my
hat, and respectfully, but cheerfully, alluded to the beauty of the
weather, the poetic inspiration of so lovely a spot, and awaited her
, Sir! such soft eyes! And I saw that she was about to reply.
She did. She said—
“Yes, there ain't a many . 'ere to-day, and I ain't done
much. It’s iº is the reg thing, but it’s what you like
to F. the gal, Sir.”
shuddered. The Romance had vanished. She had change for
half-a-crown, that is, she gave me a shilling, said “Thankye, Sir,”
showed me out through a gate, which she locked on the inside, and
then I was alone on Shanklin Beach—alone with the bathing-
machines.
Shanklin will be a great #. one of these days, when the climate
is changed and the projected buildings are º
Your º: dined at Shanklin, and, as up to six in the
afternoon there is nothing to do at Shanklin, and after that hour
still less, I returned by the up-train to Ryde.
As º any public, amusement, the evenings at Ryde are a
trifle dull. However, if fine, everybody is out till they turn in for
the night; and, if wet, everybody turns in, and won't go out.
Wentriloquists and Conjurors occasionally try their luck here, and
do well, I believe, for once only. I observed that the feautiful and
the Gifted, who so long delighted London, at the Queen's Theatre,
with their performance of Elizabeth and her young friend, were
advertised to appear for one-week at Ryde. But—
0, MRs. RousBy!
If the night's fair
Folks take the air,
What will your house be?
At one-time I thought of turning this absence of entertainment to
as good account as did an enterprising gentleman with a limited
knowledge of legerdemain in California. It occurred to me that I
might get one good house, and that then I should have to leave
before the ormance was over, with, of course, the cash-box, so
as to save that valuable article from the fury of the audience. It
was the story of the above-mentioned conjuror in the gold regions
that ested the idea. His name was TIMMINs, or something like
escope. It struck it, and º -
knew about as many tricks as would make him an -
able after-dinner companion when the conversation flagged. #.
ever, the worse the material the greater the speculation.
A brilliant idea occurred to the entrepreneur, who immediatel
advertised TIMMINs as “The Great Basilikon Thaumaturgist,” an
fitted him with a programme announcing such wonders as had never
before been seen there or anywhere else. Elephants were to fly out
of snuff-boxes, a living head would walk and talk in the air; in
fact, there was no limit to the marvels, except that at the foot of
the bill was an intimation to the effect that “this programme might
be varied’—and so it, was considerably. But there was one good
house at all events. “The Great Basilikon Thaumaturgist” disap-
peared only to re-appear with some other title elsewhere, probably
in America, as a Lieutenant, a Colonel, or a Doctor, for it is notice:
able that these peripatetic ºniº are nothing unless dubbed
with some military or learned prefix.
Had Ibut known five tricks, three with cards and two without, I
would have given an evening with Colon EL FLIx. I should have
chosen this title, it’s so vague—“ColoneL FLIx, the Celebrated
Double-handed isaurian Trompydeuxoeilist, and Spiritualistic As-
modeusexmachinistical Delusoriat; with ” (of course) “testi-
monials from all the Crowned Heads of Europe who have witnessed
my astounding performances.”
As representing You, Sir, I am the soul of honour, and, therefore,
I did not venture upon the above entertainment. No ; I went to
bed early, and dreamt that I was King of the Isle of Wight.
Ql but if I were ! “ Sij'étais Roi de Boeotie /* What an army

WHY I AM IN TOWN.
BECAUSE I have long felt a strong desire to know by personal
experiment what London is like at this season of the year.
Because the house requires some repairs, and I am anxious to be
on the spot to look after the workpeople.
Because the progress of my book on Universal Eccentricity renders
it necessary that I should pay frequent visits to the Library of the
British Museum.
Because I have been everywhere, and know every place.
Because the sanitary condition of the only place I at all care to
go to is not altogether satisfactory.
Because my Uncle ANTHONY is expected home every º
Australia, and I am unwilling to be absent from Town w
arrives. -
Because my Cousin SELINA is going to be married from her ste
father's at Upper Clapton, and insists on my giving her away to the
ºman §whom she is about to penetrate into the interior of
Ca.
Because I am desirous to avail myself of this opportunity of com-
pleting some statistical tables I am compiling, showing the compara-
tive numbers of horses, carriages, and, pedestrians passing my
dining-room windows on the last Saturday in May and the last
Saturday in August respectively.,.
Because my eldest son is -
Army examination, and I feel I am of some use to him
studies. -
Because my AUNT PHILIPPA is detained in Town by an attack of
gout, and expects me to call and sit with her three times a day:
use I am determined to put into execution my long-cherished
design of thoroughly exploring the British Museum, the National
Gallery, the South Kensington Museum, St. Paul's, Westminster
Abbey, the Public Monuments, and the City Churches.
Because it is pecuniarily inconvenient to me to be anywhere else.

SALT ON TWO TAILS.
THERE's a way to catch birds that I’m told never fails,
If the catcher's but sharp, and the birds but flat enough,
And that is by putting of salt on their tails;
Of which two samples have lately come pat enough.
At Kanturk, in South Ireland, 'twas bird-catcher BUTT,
At Mold, in North Wales, it was bird-catcher BILL,
Who contrived on a brace of green goslings to shut
The hands which both tails had first salted with skill.
'Twas 6 reen-Gosling ARCH-from his common astray—
Spread his innocent tail for BUTT's salt of Home Rule;
And Green-Gosling TAFFY, his tail gave a prey
To the salt of soft sawder, from GLADSTONE the cool.
Ah, if talk smooth and soft would but answer for more
Than putting the snit on the tail of the bird,
“Home Rule” might not end, like Repeal dreams of yore;
And Welsh bards, harps, and triads again might be heard.
As it is, while the Saxon's hard head sets its teeth
'Gainst the drowsier, dreamier mood of the Celt,
Harder still will be higher, while softer, beneath,
In vain attempts harder to master or melt.
Unreasonable Expectation.
It seems that the “Commissioners of Northern Lights” were not
represented on the day that the PRINCE OF WALEs opened the new
| Breakwater and Harbour at Holyhead. No surprise need have been
felt at their absence. The Aurora Borealis is not usually seen in
the flºtime. and this is not the season of the year for it to appear
| at all.
BURGLARY AND CHEMISTRY.
WE have heard of murder being regarded as one of the Fine Arts,
and we think that, burglary may likewise be included in , the
catalogue: at least, if we may judge by the scientific way in which
the thing is now conducted. In the pockets of a lately captured
student of the art there were discovered, says the newspapers:-
“Two bottles, one containing sulphur and the other chloroform, and a
glass tube containing quicksilver, so pointed that it cut glass easily.”
Here we i. see a proof of the progressive spirit of the age.
Formerly a housebreaker went about his business with a pistol and
a crowbar, but chloroform and quicksilver are surely more refined,
and may be just as efficacious. For ourselves, if MR. BILL SIkhs
paid us a nocturnal visit, we should certainly prefer to have our
sense of feeling, numbed rather than have our brains blown out.
If they thus take to using chemicals, burglars may, in time, be
qualified to act as medical practitioners, at least, so far as may
regard the scientific method of applying anaesthetics.

A NARROW ESCAPE.
Country Magistrate. “PRIsonER, You'RE DIschARGED THIS TIME witH A CAUTION ; BUT IF
- WE SEE You HERE AGAIN, YoU'LL GET Twice. As MUCH !!”
PENAL PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.
THE Legal Profession has an ornament in MR. CoMMIssionER KERR; who, if his lot
had been cast in the Profession of Physic, would have equally adorned that. Such, at
least, is the supposition suggested by the subjoined extract from a column of news:–
“Two men, named PILLARD and Ives, having been convicted of a robbery with violence on a tram
conductor at Holloway, the learned Commissioner said for the last few sessions there had been a remark-
able absence of such offences from the calendar, and he had hoped that the sentences ordinarily
ronounced for that class of crime had at last succeeded in deterring persons from engaging in it. This,
lowever, was a very bad case, and being determined, if possible, to put down the system, he should
sentence the prisoners to be twice flogged—twenty lashes upon each occasion. PILLARP must be kept
in penal servitude for fifteen years, with five years' subsequent police supervision, and Ives must be
imprisoned and kept to hard labour for two years. Lewis TAYLoR, for a robbery with violence at
Muswell Hill, was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude and five years' subsequent police super-
vision, and to be twice flogged, receiving each time twenty lashes with the ‘cat.’”
The ºf piece of satisfactory intelligence evinces a perception similar to the medical
sense, which, when a remedy of known efficacy fails to do all the good expected from it
tells the practitioner to increase the dose, and to prescribe its more uent repetition. I}
necessary to put down garotting, the judicious as well as judicial doctor will not shrink
from the º of some thirty or more stripes three times a year or so. The Hom E
SECRETARY would do well to have the above, and every similar record printed in the form
of a bill, to be extensively posted, about the slums and elsewhere for the edification of the
ruffianly classes. The warning thus given them would tend to prevent the necessity of
inflicting a painful and degrading punishment on our fellow-man.
Wonderful Sagacity of a Horse.
ON the day of the match between Sussex and Kent at Eastbourne, a few days since, the
Huntsman of the Southdown Packyery kindly brought the hounds, on to the Cricket-ground
to amuse the Visitors. A venerable old horse, who pulls the roller, on seeing the hounds,
was taken with a fit of “boiling-house on the brain,” and, thinking that they had come to
eat him, retired into his stable, and has not since been enticed out.
Better Conduct.
ARMAGH has lately been the scene of the dedication of a Roman Catholic Cathedral.
CARDINAL CULLEN officiated, and “aspersed the walls,” and “aspersed the entrance.”
We are very glad that this was all, and that the Cardinal did not “asperse” the Ministry,
or Parliament, or the Education Board, or the Irish Colleges, or Protestantism, or the
whole English nation. -

THERE are several periodicals devoted to

nouncement from the Dublin Daily Express of August 27th, and,
as everybody knows, Irish news is always trustworthy:—

2000 men, 100 horses, and three guns, attended Mass, and received the sacra-
ment at Repill. They left the same day for the province of Gerona.”
A Correspondent informs us that Juggernaut customs are still
observed in Norfolk, as may be seen by this passage in the Norfolk
and Norwich Argus:–
... “The son of MR. ToMIsos, of Wheltham, got his leg in the wheel of a

. The Western Morning News is a strong supporter of the Permis-
sive Bill... But it employs a foreign 5.º. who is evidently
a spirit of another sort, and altogether jolly. Here is the “tooral-
looral” utterance with which he concludes a letter from Pontresina.
.*From over mountainstreams until Ireached the two lakes near the Hos-
pice, and so down the in the most grogeous moonlight that I have ever
seen, seven hours' walking, including half an hour's halt at amountain inn,
brought me back tolerably weary to Prontresina.”
In Warwickshire there appears to be a difficulty in the way of
obtaining Wives. Gentlemen of various ranks in the social scale
are obliged to make their proposals by advertisement, e.g. :-
O LADY CAPITALISTS.—The Son of an Officer of high rank in
the Army, and of high social position in the Midland Counties.—Address,
A Respectable Chimney-Sweeper, with home and trade, forty miles
from Manchester, Wishes to Meet with a respectable Person as WIFE;
a little means preferable; reference given and required.—Address, &c.
This last is in a Warwickshire paper. The advertiser seems to
think that his living * miles from Manchester is a recommenda-
tion. That depends. e should not like to sweep many of the
Manchester Round Towers, known as chimneys. On the other
hand, we have broughtaway the noblestheadaches from Manchester,
where hospitality is of the old English kind, and we hope to get
several others there.
In Devonshire, on the contrary, young Ladies, seem to find it
necessary to proclaim their accomplishments. This is a shame, for
a Devonshire É. is one of the choicest productions of bountiful
nature. The following advertisement has been sent to Mr. Punch
by about º Correspondents, to whom (and especially to one

“indignant ” who thinks that “the Advertiser ought to be

Uxbridge is, we believe, somewhat nearer to Town. Its name
was originally Oxbridge. it is clearly a pastoral sort of place, and
its inhabitants are persons with sweet and domestic proclivities. They
do not understand a gentleman's enjoying himself without “wife,
children, and friends.” Let vitiate ndoners take this lesson to
heart, and hasten to join the circle of friends who do not wish their

We quite agree with the next advertiser, who hails from Liver-
pool, in thinking that any tradesman who wants his books balanced
at the end of the year (when ev y, especially hard-working
accountants, ought to be enjoying their Christmas), deserves to be
executed, with the greatest of care, and the execution should be
“strictly private.”

does not. John KNox himself would only have written like himself
if he had written the foregoing sentences. If the ARCHINEACON 9F
TAUNToN goes on delivering his mind in that style, he will get to be
called GEORGE ANTHONY MARPRELATE. This £rotestantism, if
persisted in, will debar the ARCHDEACON of TAUNTON from the
promotion which he might get one of these days by consistently
following the lead of a sometime N OF CHICHESTER,
The mock-papists who go about leading captive simpletons by
inculcating the obligation of Auricular Confession to themselves as
Father Confessors, profess, great reverence for the episcopal office.
To them Bishops in the abstract are Right Reverend Fathers, &c.
but the concrete Bishop they are apt, very commonly, to speak o
in terms implying that, they account him no, better than a fool, a
bigot and a heretic. When a Bishop “snubs” an ultra-Protestant,
or any Protestant at all, then they extoltheir ecclesiastical superior;
and when he “pats on the back” any mime of Popery, they lau
him still more; but whensoever they themselves are pulled up by
the vestments, or rapped on the knuckles with the crosier, #
resent their reproof with abusive insolence, or contemptuous chaff.
In their capacity of “Catholics,” indeed, they appear to consider
themselves “a cut above” Protestant Bishops, and herein their
pseudo-po º is something peculiar. The Russian-Greek Priests
are all . Popes. What these Priests are denominated, our
Ritualist Parsons seemingly believe themselves to be; every man
his own Pope, and his Bishop's or any other Bishop's Pope too.
ARCHDEAcon DENISON's friends might evince their º of
his “Catholicism” by subscribing for, and presenting him with, a
testimonial, in the shape of a tiara or triple cap, with a difference
from the Pope's own; a triple difference. The summit of the ca

your ticket, which you ought to have in readiness to be produced at
any moment.
Mock-Popery Made Easy.
IT is whispered that a great improvement, from a Ritualist point
of view, might be e in the ispering Gallery of St. Paul's.
In that situation there might be established a Confessional, to con-
sist of a chair on one side of the Gallery for the Priest, and a stool
opposite to it on the other for the Penitent, so that the former might
sit, and the latter might kneel, with their faces to the wall, and the
confession be made, and the absolution pronounced, with commo-
dious privacy, in that position.
The Dog and the Lawyers.
According to the reports of proceedings at the Maidenhead Bench
of Magistrates, A, a dog belonging to B, a Queen's Counsel, bit C,
an Attorney. C struck A, B struck C, who had been bitten by A,
and . to give his name “because he, thought that C was
simply a tradesman.” Looking at the case with an unprejudiced eye,
it appears to us that the title Q.C. must mean “Queer Customer.”

ORTHodoxy and common sense are combined with economy in the

“A correspondent of the John Bull advocates the abolition of godfathers
and godmothers. The causes which led to the institution of sponsors have,
he says, ceased to exist; the sacrament of baptism is complete without them,
and if they were done away with very many religious Dissenters would return
to the Church.”
Godfathers and godmothers have now nothing, to do, for their
spiritual children, that they possibly can, spiritually. Their office
would be a mere sinecure if it were lucrative as well as nominal, and
did not, on the contrary, involve doing, something attended with
expense. Those who give other people's children names, are
expected also to give them plate: so that godfathers and god-
mothers, heretofore called sponsors, had in these days better be
denominated spoonsors.

IDoubtful.
A CoEREspond ENT, who signs himself “RICHARD,” and insinuates
that his modest income is not º to his deserts, asks whether we
think the “Edinburgh Dick Trust” would be disposed to assist
him. We advise him to apply to the Trustees, and to enclose an
envelope ready stamped and addressed.
LOGIC AND LIQUOR.
CoLoREL HENDERSON's Report on the Metropolitan Police is a
º of no mean literary ability. The gallant Colonel is
oubtless, a man of reading. In the document above-mentioned
there is a passage which seems to indicate acquaintance with
Tristram Shandy. . It is stated that drunkenness has greatly
increased during the past year; insomuch, that the arrests for
incapability and disorder, which in 1869 had been only 23,000,
amounted to as many as 34,000 in 1872. So much for the operation
of the Licensing Act. Such, at least, is the comment of a common
mind on the relation between those figures and that statute. But
the Chief Commissioner of Police remarks:—
*It must be a matter of conjecture how much further these offences would
have prevailed if this Act had not been passed.”
When certain sage disputants, in a controve recorded by
STERNE in the above-named biography, are reminded that some-
thing ...i.” to their theory, should have been the case,
happened otherwise:–
“It ought not, said they.”
The Licensing Act was passed on purpose to prevent drunkenness,
and drunkenness has increased enormously since its enactment.
The Archbobby seems to entertain the comwiction that “it ought”
to have prevented drunkenness, and, he is so sure of that, that
he suggests that it must have in a measure, so that, but for its
operation, drunkenness would have been stillmore lent. He
says it must be armatter of conjecture how much her offences
punishable under the Licensing Act would have prevailed if it had
not been passed. But is it not also a matter of conjecture whether,
if the Licensing Act had not been passed, there would have been no
increase of drunkenness at all, and possibly a diminution? How do
we know that the Licensing Act has not provoked manymento drink
the to excessin defiance of a law by which they are coerced as though
they were children? It is even very likely that, on Sundays
especially, when people cannot obtain intoxicating liquors” during
the hours of closing prescribed by the Sabbatarians, and in particular
when they most want refreshment, from three till six in the after-
noon, they are to drink as much as they canwhile they can, and
| drink with a widity, aggravated by having been kept waiting for
their liquor three
Doubtless, however, it would be a mistake to charge the vastly
increasing drunkenness of the Pº. wholly on the Licensing
Act. The spread of that truly degrading vice has coincided not
only with the working of that measure, but also with a continual
rise in the s of mechanical working-men. They can afford the
same excess in “intoxicating liquors” that they can in all other
good things... They, if they are determined to get drunk, will, in
spite of the Licensing Act, or any other Liquor Law, and their dear
friends of the stump and platform, if they really want to sober
them, should exhort them all to strike for a general reduction of
Wages.
WHY I AM OUT OF TOWN.
º we always leave our comfortable home at this season of
e year.
Because the DACREs, the ETTRICKs, the LADBROKES, the GRAN-
VILLE DAWSONs, and all the other ople we know, are away.
Because the best bedroom wanted papering and §.
Because they are taking up the sº in the nt.
Because MR. HENRY DILwATER, M.R.C.S. and L.A.C., observed
that our youngest boy, ALFRED ATHELSTAN, required ºf;
Because the BARRINGTONs are at Cliffenooking, and DUDLEY

PLENTY TO WEAR.
THE lady who teaches other ladies to make one dress last out the
time which two dresses lasted before deserves well of her country-
men. Who will deny that but drapers and milliners? What, then,
does she deserve who informs our wives and daughters how they
may contrive to dress at the rate of nearly one-seventh less than
what, on a moderate estimate, as times go, they have, many of
them, been accustomed to spend? Certainly a ; husband, if she
wants one, or an income at least sufficient for her moderate wants as
a spinster, if she is wise º to prefer that.
t is not uncommon for ladies to regard £100 per annum as a
reasonable sum to expend on their wardrobes. One-seventh of that
sum would more than suffice. A little railway-stall book, written
“By a Lady,” now instructs all whom it may concern how to dress
“as a lady” on £15 a-year. Comparatively, this allowance is
moderate in the extreme. Practically, perhaps, it is the lowest
ssible figure. But consider, dears. Best coals are now 36s, a ton.
The consumption of coals sufficient for a whole family in a house of
moderate size would amount, say, to about eight tons a year =
£14.8s. Now the principal utility of .."; apparel consists in
serving to keep you warm. The measure of dress represented by
£15 required for clothing by one individual lady, exceeds by 12s.
the quantity of coals which would be large enough to supply half-a-
dozen people or so with heat. All the clothing necessary for that
purpose, merely, is reducible to things which cost much less than
£15; and the considerable difference between their price and that
sum goes for mere ostentation. Dear are the dictates of Society.
Substrata of woollens with a cotton surface would be all that comfort
would necessitate for feminine attire; and the various descriptions
of calico would lend themselves readily enough to a decorative
treatment, whereby economy might be combined with elegance.
But that would ask a combination of philosophy with high Art not
to be expected.

MoRE than one paper has contained the following announcement, with an addition which
suggests the thought that the Pope must be . of SHAKSPEARE. Our contemporaries
state that His Holiness highly commends, and grants indulgences for co-operation in the
performance of the project, of which, in a brief lately published, he thus speaks:–
“As pilgrimages in Italy have been prohibited by the Government prefects, several Catholics at Bologna
have decided to invite their fellow Catholics to undertake in Septem ºr. pilgrimages—one
to the Holy Land, the second to the sacred shrines of Italy, and the third to the various foreign
sanctuaries.”
In the Fifth Act, and First Scene, of SHAKSPEARE's Henry the Fifth, you will find this
speech, from the mouth of Captain Fluellen, addressed to Ancient Pistol:—
“I, peseech you heartily, scurvy lazy knave, at my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to
eat, look you, this leek; pecause, look you, you do not love it, nor your affections, and your appetites, and
your digestions, does not agree with it, I would desire you to eat it.
Because the Government of Italy, look you, have prohibited
authority, and general order, and the public health, do not agree with them, therefore, His
Holi appears to say, I will grant indulgences to all you who take part in them. . The

My dear Mr. Punch,
- With your elegant hunch,
Pray hear a poor Schoolboy's petition,
For my jolly old Dad
Says I’m going to the bad,
And in a most hopeless condition.
I can jump five feet four,
Drive my fist through a door,
Bowl, bat, throw, and can keep up my
wicket,
Play football, and row;
But what bot rºle-now”
Is the row aboutfield-sports and Cricket.
Why, when Iwon thematch
With a left-handed catch
And they carried me to the Favilion,
With excitement and pride

And said, “That boy’s one in a million!”
And my dear Cousin GRACE,

When a boy, and now wish to dethrone me,
And whatever, I win, .
They all say “it’s a sin,”
And do nothing but scold and bemoan me.
Mr. Punch, hear my prayer;
Do you think it is fair
To make all this hubbub and bustle,
And to say, night and day,
That I’m in a bad way,
Because I have plenty of muscle?
With my youth and my strength,
I would go any length
To save the dear Governor's pocket;
To Australia, New Zealand,
Or some other free land,
If they'd send me, I’m off like a rocket.
And I don't care a rush
If I find in the bush
My fate to be hardship and danger:
Let the weak stay at home,
And leave others to roam
And cast lot in the land of the stranger.

Because some country relatives, who we can't abide, have written
to invite themselves for a quiet autumn visit.
Because we have all gone mad to get some grouse-shooting.
Because a rich old uncle has just left us a small legacy, too trifling
to invest, but just enough to pay for a little trip to Paris.
Because we keep a yacht, and must go once a year to keep the

Because London gets so stuffy in the Autumn, don't you know,
and (excepting some three millions) really nobody can breathe in it.
Because, like geese, we are gregarious, and birds of a feather are
bound to go and flock together.
Because our tailor has been bothering us about his little account,
and perhaps he may forget it if we go out of town a bit.
Because there's nobody at the Club, except that awful bore, old

Because our Doctor has commanded us to try some German baths,
to cure that ache in our big toe, which has perplexed us ever since

IN an account of “the English Pilgrimage” it is stated that the
Pilgrims about to start arrived at the Victoria Station soon after five

of being disappointed at encountering a like deficiency, would pro-

TEMPERANCE “OLD TOM.”
--
RDINARILY, the “intoxicating liquors,” commonly
known under the name of “spirits,” are whiskey,
brandy, gin, hollands, and rum, to which has
lately been added the New Tea Spirit, Robur—a
spirit that ought to be very strong if Robur
means strength, and not the oak-tree, as though
tea-leaves and oak-leaves were convertible terms.
But the #. which intoxicate people are more
than are dreamt of in your Temperance philosophy. Amongst them
there are some not exciseable. Not only so, but they are imponder-
able too, and, more than that, metaphysical. These are spirits of the
uality, in relation to matter, of esprit de corps, and they very often
o, like that, actuate parties and sects. They have, for example,
actuated certain assemblies at Banbury to the excess of creating
disturbances, insomuch that the Magistrates in Petty Sessions there
had to order the Police to stop all public meetings in the open air.
A MR. JAMES CADBURY, a member of the Society of Friends, and
President of the Tem Society, *ś. , apparently, by
that prohibition, brought the decision of the Magistrates under the
notice of the SECRETARY OF STATE. According to the Times:–
*The Home SECRETARY asked for observations on MR. CADBURY's letter
from the Magistrates' Clerk, and he writes that it was represented to the
Magistrates that the intemperate language of the Temperance advocates had
caused a breach of the peace, and that the Magistrates did not direct any pro-
ceedings to be taken, but simply directed the police in future to prevent, as
far as possible, all such meetings as tended to a breach of the peace, or caused
an obstruction of the thoroughfare.”
“The intemperate lan of the Temperance advocates” had
obliged the Banb agistrates to have all public meetin
dispersed, in order that such language might not continue to
used and create disorder at Temperance Meetings. The disorder
thus occasioned is an instance of the effect of a mental intoxicating
spirit. By the intoxicating spirit of fanatical Temperance those
possessed with it are made drunk and disorderly, just as though it
were so much gin. MR. CADBURY, of course, is a Quaker, but
he might as well be a wet one, worse than the late weather, as the
j. of a Society whose meetings are pervaded by an ardent
spirit, which inflames a domineering and dictatorial officiousness,
and so excites its victims that they behave exactly like wretches
under the influence of “intoxicating liquors.” #. ought... if
possible, to be some law analogous to the Licensing Act, which
would restrain the intemperate advocates of Temperance from
abandoning themselves to spirits which degrade them below the
level of the brute.
Smelfungus on Fines.
THE fulfilment of our desires is generally attended with reward,
and followed by punishment. Through indulgence in good living
we incur gout. A family, however, is not always an affliction.
Some men do not care about their children. Others are opulent.
“Children must be paid for,” but penalties are payable without
pain by people who have plenty of money.

The burden of the French, Pilgrims' hymn is “Sauvez Rome et

THE TORPEDO'S MATE.
WHAT limits can be assigned to the size of which it would be pos-
sible to construct an electro-magnet? Because, if one could be
made sufficiently big, it would be capable of attracting the largest

connected with a galvanic battery, and, the moment it is discon-
nected therefrom, loses its magnetism, its .*.* means of
coast and harbour defence would be most simple. t is there to
hinder making a bar of soft iron into the form of a horseshoe as large
as necessary, and surrounded with a coil of .#. wire duly insu-
lated; and then stationing it on a suitable platform erected on some
convenient shoal or mudbank, or in any other handy situation?
That done, what would be easier than to lay down a conductor by
which the coil surrounding the bar might, at will, be placed in con-
nection with the battery required to make it a magnet? The
moment this was done, would not your magnet immediately attract
any iron vessel within a considerable distance, even more powerfully
than the loadstone-mountain did the ship in the Arabian Nights?
Would it not thus afford you the means of running an enemy

i. to practice, perhaps you will remember who it was that first

A FAIR FLOWER-SELOW.
A FLow ER-SHow, consisting of the Virgineaceae was held yester-
day, in the Assembly Rooms, at Missington. Prizes were awarded
to the parental exhibitors of several uncommonly beautiful speci-
mens, and others were highly commended. The winners of gold
and silver medals included an Augusta formosa, an Arabella auri-
coma, an Amelia elegans, an Agnes gracilis, a Barbara subfusca, a
Carolina rosea, a Dorothea boëpis, an Emma speciosa, a Frances
callisphyrus, and a Georgina glauea. Many others were highly
commended: in particular the Henrietta canora, and Isabella salta-
trir. Attention was attracted by the Julia ridens, the Katharina
rocar, the Louisa languens, the Maria garrula, and the Nora
quacissima. Among some specimens of a typical character, less
::::::::: by their beauty than by other peculiarities, the most
remarkable were the Olivia rotunda, the Priscilla pinguis, the Rosa
androdes, the Rebecca acuta, and the Selina simpler. The exhibi-
tion comprised a magnificent specimen of the Dorcas carota, and an
equally splendid one of the Jemima vulgaris.

Theological Anaesthetics.
HERR PHILIPP SPILLER, German philosopher, has made a dis-
covery in theology, which, if confirmed, would entirely supersede
the Athanasian Creed—and every other. He refers all things that
exist to a Universal World-AEther. This AEther is unconscious and
impersonal. The Infinite does not appear to be solved by a theory
of AEther in anywise more satisfactorily than it would by the
hypothesis of Chloroform.

of the fact is pretty certain

titled relatives of the bride.

all, such other. details of

e deemed attractive to the

protruded announcements
such as this:—
“On the 11th instant, at
the Myrtles, Little Cradleton,
AMELIA AUGUSTA, wife of TIMoThy TwaddLE, ., J.P., F.B.Z.S., &c.,
&c., of a Son [Augustus TIMorry].”
Now, MRs. GRUNDY, E. Ma'am, what imports the nomination
of this infant? Clearly the little bantling was not born ready-
christened; and viewing the celerity jº his birth has been
announced, it is hardly likely that he has been yet presented at the
font. The proclamation of the Christian names which are to be
applied to him must be therefore premature, and of nominal im-
portance. Friends at a distance, who might be expected to accept
the intimation, and to express congratulation, or, if cynical, con-
dolence, could hardly be expected to recite the welcome little
stranger's names in their letters to his parents, and say they hoped
to hear that MASTER TIMOTHY AUGUSTUs was in tolerable health.
For months that little gentleman will be called Baby by his Nurse,
and prºbably addressed by its Mamma as a “pooty ducksy wucksy,’
or a “tiddy ickle sing; ” and we certainly opine that it is some-
what premature to print his more distinctive appellations in the
newspaper. -
A SEA ROMANCE.
A DAY and a night and a morning
We sailed on the lonely deep,
While the water-spouts did around us,
With horrible tameness, leap.
There came on the passing whirlwind
A sound of the dread Typhoon,
And the sun went down in anger
At three in the afternoon.
We heard the song of the Mermaid,
As she silently combed her hair;
The voiee of the warbling Walrus,
The shriek of the Polar bear.
The Captain stood on the cross-tree,
The Mate on the paddle-box,
The Purser upon the fe’c’stle-
He sighted some sunken rocks.
And the good ship heeled to starboard;
And then she listed to port.
“O, give me a drink!” cried the Captain,
“Give it me stiff and short.”
And the good ship heeled to starboard—
Her yards were in the wave:
The Mate shook hands with the Purser,
For both were young and brave.
+ + - -
As the tain's bride was selling
Her winkles on Wi. Stair,
She saw a shrieking phantom,
With sea-weed instead of hair.
Its eyes were cold and fishlike,
The eels went in and about;
A codfish was in its bosom,
In its pockets were whiting pout.
The Mate had an only mother—
She worked in the charing line;
That night she saw her first-born,
His countenance soaked in brine.
The Purser he was an orphan,
With nowhere to lay his head:
The parish beadle started
That night on his feather bed.

A day and a night and a morning
Had B. over wave and shore,
When the good ship hailed a pilot
By the light-ship upon the Nore.
She steamed in silence and sorrow
To her berth in St._Catherine's Docks,
Her bobstay fast to the bowsprit,
The ropes reeved through the blocks.
The anchor fell from the cathead—
It sunk with a sullen splash.
And the Captain paid his shipmates
Their wages insterling cash.
And then he drove to his lodgings;
But vainly he sought his bride:
He called her—she could not hear him—
She was walking along Cheapside.
The Mate, he flew to his mother;
He hoped she was still alive.
But, broken by sorrow and charing,
She had taken a cab for a drive.
The Purser, a lonely orphan,
Had nowhere to lay his head,
So he went to the nearest tavern
And was carried up, tight, to bed.
Credulity and Incredulity.
Discours[Ng on the miracle alleged to have occurred two hundred
years º at Paray-le-Monial, ARCHRISHOP MANNING is reported, in
the Pall Mall Gazette, to have “said those who refused to believe
this would, had they lived at the time, have refused to believe the
Scripture miracles.”. The Pall Mall makes few mistakes, but
surely this is one of them. Regarding those miracles in comparison
with that miracle, MR. BRADIAUGH, indeed, perhaps, places them
on the same footing, and would say that those who could believe the
former would believe the latter.

We need not be much discontented.
The Houses of late, each Recess

Designed to diminish our pleasures,
Or curb us with bridle and rein.
There’s always this great compensation
For Parliament's vacuous jaws;

Afflicts us with no needless laws.

Given small cause to bless them or ban.

From all that a Briton annoys;

And what Progress daily destroys.

FROM a story told in the Newcastle Chronicle, it appears that pit-
men are really accustomed to travel in first-class carriages. Very
soon, no doubt a pitman will be able to .# his own carriage, unless
he drinks a vast deal too much first-quality champagne, Château
d'Yquem, and other extremely expensive wines. e craft of the
pitman, heretofore a mere handicraft, is rising into an art, a scien-
tific art like surgery; and the extraction of coals from the bowels
of the earth will soon be on a par, both as to dignity and remunera-
tion, with those operations by which the human frame is relieved of
morbid formations and foreign bodies. The picks and other imple-
ments used in extracting coal will come to be made of the finest
tempered steel, some of them perhaps of silver. Pitmen's wages
will cease to be so called; they will take the name of fees; and
lº gentlemen, wishing to follow an employment which will occup
ut a small portion of their time in its pursuit, be rewarded wit
high emolument, and not have its portals obstructed by any exami-
nation, will enter the Pit rather than the Medical, or any other
Profession. In the meanwhile, who but a millionnaire will be able
to afford a fire? -
Benedicto Benedicatur.
“BLEss you, my children!'” said His Holiness the Pope, through
the eloquent mouth of his servant the Archbishop, to the Pilgrims
ere they started on their progress from our shores. These progres-
sionists, we may presume, were all of them true Catholics, and we
may doubt if any Protestant who chanced to come among them
would have received the Holy Father's benediction with the rest.
Yet it is said that Mr. Punch, whom no one will accuse of Catholic
É. was heard before the Pilgrims left us to allege that, if
e joined them, he would certainly “be blest.”

fitted by his new one with this remarkable, sportingly cut pair o

admirable fit, it occurred to him that he better be consistent
from the sole of his boots to the top of his hat, and so, when he next
appeared in public, he was sporting all over. He was away for
some time—at least, his friends lost sight of him, and, when I saw li
him again, it was out with the hounds, about sixteen miles from my
cottage, whither I had driven in order to see the throw-off.
Happy Thought.—The pleasantest way of seeing a throw-off is to
be .# comfortably in a trap, drawn by a horse that won't start
at anything. How one can remark on the want of pluck shown by
the riders, and what an exciting spectacle it is to see them take the
first fence One º it, too, all, the more if you've had the

carriage), when ne comes o say “Good morning; ” for instance,
about the “throw-off,” º can say, “I’ve come to see the hounds
throw-off. Your horse looks as if it was going to throw-off first.”
Or something light and airy to that effect. Then
some one else “How he feels outside a horse?” and ask another
person, with a fresh horse, just to “pop over that hedge and let’s
see how he .”
On the whole, the longer I look back on my past experience, and
the more I consider the matter, the more ly am I convinced that
the pleasantest way of going out hunting is in a carriage, with
plenty of rugs, a flask and cigars, and, if you follow the hounds by
road, a hamper with luncheon. - -
ºf know what you want,” GLOPPIN says. This, on consideration,
is clever of GLoPPIN, after I’ve told him what i want. But tº
GLoPPIN's characteristic; he always knows “to a hair” what any- |
one wants, if they only tell him beforehand. “I know what you
want,” says GLoren, quite angrily, as if I had put my case
weakly or described my requirements inadequately; “you want a
good stout cob—”
“Yes,” I say, “about fourteen one.”
“Well,” replies. GLoPPIN, doubtfully, “about fourteen one or
two ; something that would take you a distance when you wanted
to drive, and that you could just º down and throw your leg over
when yº wanted an hour's jog along the road. You wouldn't
object,” he adds, slyly, “to getting a day's hunting out of him
occasionally.”
In the presence of my Aunt and º to whom GLOPPIN is an
oracle, I admit, with a smile intended to be quite as knowing as
GLOPPIN's, that I should not object to a day's hunting out of him.
“Lor!” says GLOPPIN, looking round at the guests and fixing my
Aunt, “I know the sort of horse he wants.”
I, too, look round with an air of satisfaction, as much as to say to
º: a Derby winner.

those who didn't know it before, “I’m a bit of a sportsman; I can
drive, I can ride, and I'm—keep your eye on me—I’m going to do
quite the Country-Squire-like sort of thing—I’m going to buy a
horse. You’ll hear GLOPPIN mention the sort of thing, and you’ll
hear me close with him.”
I am silent, regarding GLOPPIN expectantly. The guests too are
listening to what he's going to say next. -
He eyes me curiously, as if he were going to, subsequently, paint
a portrait of me, from º half-length, the remainder being
cut off by the dinner-table, and then he remarks, “Hm! Yes—he
must be º to weight.”
“Well,” I demur, pleasantly, for I feel we are getting on a deli-
cate subject, only sporting men are so fond of expressing themselves
roughly, and with unnecessary bluntness even before ladies, “Well,
of course, I couldn't ride a mere pony.”
The youngest Miss WHEEBLE, whom I have taken in to dinner,
ind with whom I have been keeping up a gay conversation about
dresses, yachting, military balls, cricket-matches, polo, and
pic-nics (all thºse subjects under a great mental strain, being
entirely foreign to my usual serious line of thought connected with
my seventh volume of Typical Developments), smiles, and observes
that, of course, I couldn't get any hunting on a pony.
Thought.—Good excuse, though, for not hunting. Not a

Safest, when uncertain about a sporting word or its meaning, to

most matters of weight. How much is a stun ? Is it twenty

What measure is this? Riding measure? . . . . Make another
note to look all this out, and have marginal references to article on
Equºrianism. - -
‘Why,” says GLOPPIN, “I ride thirteen stun, and you must
weigh quite two stun more than I do.”
“O, no,” I say, confidently.
“I’ll lay you a fiver you’re nearer fifteen stum than thirteen,”
he returns, *i.
This is another sporting way of his of riding º: over you.
He knows I won't bet, and, because I don't take his wager, every-
bº. thinks he must be right and I must be wrong.

I don't know, and I haven’t been weighed for two years. I
haven’t, because I object to the process. I shouldn't so much if it
could be done quietly, and no one except yourself be a bit the wiser.
But a weighing-machine is generally in some º: part of
some public building, and if à".§ your penny and sit down, lots
of people come round you and make remarks as to what they think
you are, and then there’s great excitement when the weighing
machinist gives out your ticket and announces }. *.
... I also object to it on another ground besides that of publicity, and
it is that I don't believe the machines are correct. I don’t think
they give a correct return any more than any Income-tax payer
does. "No weighing-machine that I’ve tried has ever satisfied me.

GLöPPIN is incredulous. , “Ah,” he exclaims, nodding his head in
confirmation of his own bigoteå opinion, *# you don't ride all

is, drop me, and take up the horse. . Set down one, and one to carry.

very superior style of animal, and I draw myself up and listen with
an air of some consequence.
“Yes,” says GLOPPIN, “any dealer, or any one who knows any-
thing about horses, will tell you”; this puts us all out of the ques-
tion, as we haven't told him—“that the most difficult thing to get
just now is what he wants, that's what they call a thorough old
gentleman's Cob.”
No, hang it! no. I protest against this description. If he had
said a prancing Arab, or cream-coloured Persian steed, or something
showy, or even a “covert hack” (which sounds sporting), I shouldn't
have minded. But to put me down as something so portly that I
can only be suited *. the sort of horse a heavy Archdeacon would
jog about on, is too bad of GLOPPIN–in company—and I believe he
does it on purpose.
Happy Thought.—Laugh the suggestion out of court. Treat it as
GEOPPIN's joke. If my attempt is successful every one will think
it was GLOPPIN's joke, and a very stupid one.
“No,” GLOPPIN insists, evidently rather annoyed at his sugges-
tion being pooh-poohed, “that is what You want an old gentleman's
Cob, perfectly safe and sound. But,” he adds, “it’s a precious
difficult thing to get.” -
I thought he knew of one. No, he doesn’t, he wishes he did;
worth any money just now, GLOPPIN promises to be on the look
out, and to let me know of anything likely. A relation of his, he
says, had the verything—“the very thing,” he repeats, emphati-
cally, and then stops, as if debating within, himse whether his
relation couldn't somehow be got rid of, or the animal stolen, as it
were, from under him, . The expression on GLQPPIN's face just now
does not suggest the idea of obtaining his relative's horse by any
fair means. - -
“Won't he part with it?” I ask, ºnly, with the air of a
millionnaire, to whom money was no o jº. -
“Part with it!” returns GLOPPIN. “He sold it last week.”
Happy Thought.—CLUMBER, the livery stable-keeper, from whom
we have our flys, may know of something or have something. Will
see CLUMBER to-morrow.
Before GLOPPIN leaves us, I impart to him my ideal of the horse I
want. Fourteen hands high, to go in my pony trap, perfectly quiet
to ride or drive, good-looking, if not handsome, bay preferred with
four black legs, must not be afraid of trains, mustn't shy, kick, or
rear, be quite good-tempered, no vice, in fact all virtue, age risin
six—by which I mean §: the expression itself may mean
between six and seven years old, price not more than forty guineas.
“Ah,” says GLOPPIN, “you'd like one given you.”
I should. One was given me once. I shall never fºrgºt him. He
wouldn't stand still, he wouldn't be ridden, he wouldn't be driven
he never kept the same pace for two consecutive minutes, he tºssed
his head up and down as if he were throwing up a ball and §

This is a long time ago, and I flatter myself I know more about
what I do really want now, so to-morrow see CLUMBER the Flyman.
The Nursery Rhyme occurs to me—“Simple Simon met a Flyman”

Some One's Own Colours.
THE Standard, with reference to modern Pilgrims, remarks that,
owing to the policy of the Vatican, “there is being organised a

“A Good SKIRMISHER, IF THERE Is No Cover, should HIDE BEHIND HIs Boots "
SCIENCE IN SEASON.
UNDER the head of “Science Gossip” the Athenaeum informs us that—
“An original suggestion as to the probable origin of nerve-force has been thrown out by MR. A. H.
GARRod. He believes that the difference of temperature between the interior of a living organism and
its external surface is an available source of energy, hitherto unrecognised, which may reasonably be
supposed to give rise to an electric nerve-current.”
The National Association for the advancement of that which is the subject of our learned
and scientific contemporary's above-quoted gossip, will perhaps deliberate on the suggestion
therein contained. Experience (it may be hoped) has already taught the majority of philoso-
phers that the affusion of cold water on the human body in the daily matutinal performance
of “tubbing” is usually attended with a convulsion very similar to a shock of electricity.
How much her they will get than that point, we shall be glad to see. In continuation,
on MR. GARRoD's theory, the Athenaeum observes:–
“Admitting such an hypothesis, it is easy to see why, at this season, most of us feel lacking in nerve-
force, or why the prolonged use of a hot-water bath induces a feeling of faintness. The greatest supply
of nerve-force, and, therefore, the greatest amount of vigour, is naturally to be got in cold weather, when
a considerable difference of temperature obtains between the exterior and the interior of the body.”
From the context of the hot-water bath with the season referred to in the foregoing
passage, this may be, supposed to have been written in warm weather. Accordingly, the
sages of the National Association will perhaps consider whether the exhaustion occasioned by
a high temperature, and the faintness induced by a hot bath do not mainly arise from what
the Faculty call diaphoresis. Also whether, although the greatest supply of nerve-force,
and therefore the greatest amount of vigour, is naturally to be got by some people, namely,
the young, in cold weather, the smallest supply of nerve-force, and, therefore, the smallest
amount ºf vigour, is therein as naturally to be º worse luck! by the aged. Everybody
knows how fast a cold winter carries off old people; and with what hopes, in case they have
much property to leave behind them, a fall of the thermometer about Christmas inspires their
youthful relatives.
As to the origin of nerve-force from the difference between internal and external tempera-
ture, the National Association may vouchsafe to perpend the following doggerel:—
What in fishes is the source
Whence originates nerve-force?
How much warmer is a trout
As it swims, inside than out?
If these are only fool's questions, philosophers may be pleased to laugh at them.
“Circumstances alter Cases.”
BUNTING was using his telescope on the delightful new pier at Haroldstown. BRIggs
came º to him, and said, “What's that?” BUNTING, surprised, “Why, a telescope, of
course!” Whereupon BRIggs rejoined, “I should call it a pier glass.”

Canonization and Causes.
WITH respect to Canonization there are
two “Causes” which certainly ought to be
submitted to His Holiness the Pope. They
are those which produce at least the great
majority of apparitions and visions, which
they have occasioned time out of mind.
They have, therefore, pretensions to the
title of “Venerable” which might be well
entertained at Rome; and then, in due
time, they might be decreed full Saints, b
the names of SS. Hypochondriasis an
Hysteria.

NEW PATERNAL POSTAGE RULES.
THE PostMASTER-GENERAL (pre
tory to leaving office) gives
notice that from and after the 1st
ctober next the following rules
and regulations will be inforce, and that any deviation from them ||
will be punished with the utmostrigour of the Law:—
1. No person is to write, outside a letter, º: the direc-
tion. If it-is-wished to send a public message, a halfpenny card
must be employed.
2. A Stamp, once affixed, must remain, and any person washing
off a Stamp, and gumming it on another envelope, will be liable to
prosecution.
3. Directions must be properly punctuated, with a semi-colon
after the name; a colon after each following line: and a peri
after the concludin word, which must be written large. Otherwise,
no letter will be .
4. Sealing-wax is prohibited, as the sharp edges of a carelessly-
mºr. #:º ºt. d in lieu of a P S
5. Two ny Stamps may be used in lieu of a Penny Stamp,
but only when the letter is posted on Sunday, and other Stamps are
not to be obtained. But the PostMASTER-GENERAL recommends the
Heads of Families to ascertain from every member of the household,
on Saturday evening, before or after prayers, whether he or she is
supplied with Stamps for the following day.
6. For London letters, the district initials must be added, or the
letter will be detained
prosecution.
7. Letters placed in the wrong box at a receiving-house will be
confiscated.
8. No Writer is to inscribe his own name at the corner of a direc-
tion, as the Receiver can discover the Sender by perusing the letter,
and the Postman's attention is liable to be distracted by any need-
for a week. Wrong initials will entail
od º: of sympathising in,
less writing. Initials, however, are permitted, but not more than
two. -
9. Stamps, at the Sender's peril, may be enclosed, but the letter
must be strongly perfumed, as otherwise the smell of the Stamp
can easily be detected, and tempts the officials.
10. No letter under four inches long, by two and a half wide, will
be delivered in any circumstances, and iºdies are specially desired
to notice this.
11. Where two letters are addressed to the same person, the
numerals No. 1, No. 2, must not be inscribed, as they might mislead
the Postman into calling at the wrong house, but “Letter Number
One” may be written in words, on the back.
12. Letters to persons of any title must be addressed correctly,
and in accordance with the rules in Dod's Peerage. For instance,
if a letter to a Dean be addressed “the Wenerable,” instead of the
“Wery Reverend,” it will not be delivered. The omission of the
contracted word “Bart.,” or its use where a Knight is addressed,
will be equally fatal.
13. No tradesmanºis, to be addressed as “Esquire,” either at his
place of business, or his country house. He cannot have two social
positions.
14 Sehoolboys are to be addressed by their Christian names and
Surnames alone, without ºil. as are all Collegians, except
those at the Universities, and all servants, except widows.
15. Coloured or tinted is not to be used for envelopes, as it
º: on the letter a certain importance which is unfair to other
Porre n -
16. º flourishes are to be used, and no dashes or underlining will
be allowed. Write legibly, and leave the rest to the intelligence of
the Department.
17. Where there is doubt as to the number of a house, “8” or
“9” must not be written... This compels the Postman to ask a
question. The letter should be sent in duplicate, a copy to each
house, and the person for whom it is not designed will return it to
the Postman, on pain of prosecution.
18. If a stampbe placed in the wrong corner of the envelope, or
be reversed, or affixed sideways, the letter will be destroyed.
19. The Post-MASTER has heard, with profound astonishment and
regret, that a Postman, who has just taken letters from a Pillar,
ill hold open his bag to receive a letter with which a maid-servant
or other person hurries up, a moment too late. Any Postman
. in such an offence against System will instantly be dis-
Charged.
20, Posting a letter is a serious and solemn business, yetitisfre-
quently entrusted to children and others without an uate-sense
of responsibility. The Police will receive instructions to prevent
such persons from depositing letters, as, unless-the nature of an
oath be understood by them, a prosecution of a defaulting receiver
i.tº be defeated. No child under twelve must be sent to post a
etter.
[These simple rules are provisional only, and may be added to by
a paternal Post-MASTER, at his pleasure, should he be able to devise
any other regulations in accordance with the present, policy of
legislation for British Citizens.]
KING: COFFEE.
A NEWSPAPER, the other day, published the somewhat serio-comic
announcement that—
“The principal officers in command of the expedition againströng CofFEE
and the Ashantees embarked at Liverpool yesterday, en route to the Gold
Coast.”
The expedition against the Ashantees will be no joke to those
concerned in it, or to any others capable of imagining, and not in-
the hardships and sufferings which it
cost brave men. Yet who but feels as one sitting at a burlesque
when he contemplates the idea of BRITANNIAgoing to war with KING
CoFFEE * It will be recollected that, in the Crimea once, she went
to war without KING CoFFEE, so to speak; for the Coffee where-
withal her troops were provided was green, insomuch that it could
not be ground, and was of no use. No mistake, however, of that
kind, is meant to be made on this occasion; for active operations
are in progress at Deptford Wictualling Yard to supply the Forces
with soluble Chocolate. And as to Coffee, let us hope that KING
CoFFEE, of the Ashantees, will get so effectually roasted as to be
done thoroughly brown, and ground up as easily and as
if he were Mocha.

THE late Pilgrimage has at least earned the Duke of Norfolk
and his companions a name. Those devotees are now denominated

erson of Scotland's not numerous if highly select pilgrims to
}. -le-Monial. The honour which MonsignoR *::::::::
ascri to Scotland was sturdily disclaimed on Scotland's behalf
by MR. JAMEs Dow, a truly representative Scotchman, and also the
representative of our above-quoted contemporary, who, responding,
on call, to the toast of “The Press,” avowed himself the Protestant
Correspondent of a strongly Protestant paper, and with frankness,
but respect, told his hearers “*. that since he came among
them he had seem much that he could not sympathise with nor
appreciate,” and added that, as to KNox:—
“MossIGNolt MERMILLoD had alluded to the doctrines of KNox, in which
he (M.R., Dow) had been brought up, and no Scotchman present had any
cause to be ashamed of the country which had accepted those doctrines. Knox,
like themselves, was a believer in the Incarnation, and those who accepted
his teaching were quite as strongly opposed as the Catholics themselves to the
materialism which had been denounced that day—opposed to it whether it
appeared in the writings of men like STRAUss, or the cheap scepticism of the
young man of the period.”
. Not only were the flower of the Scottish nobility, some of them,
included amongst the Paray-le-Monial Pilgrims, but the pilgrimage
was attended by a Newspaper Correspondent, who moreover dis-
played a signal correspondence to the Scottish national flower. On
the subject of John Knox, MR. JAMEs Dow was to be touched
withimpunity no more than a thistle. He would not hear defamation
ºf the great Scotch Reformer unrebuked, but lifted up his voice and
bore testimony against it in the spirit, but without the cant, of a
Covenanter. It is not very easy to see how Scotland is, as Mon-
SIGNOR MERMILLop asserts, now having her revenge against Geneva
for having given, Scotland KNox. Scotland is not giving Geneva
knocks in any blows Geneva, may receive from the flower of the
Scotch nobility who joined the pilgrimage to the shrine of Miss
ALACOQUE., Even if Geneva, gets any, the knocks are of the very
softest. . But Rome received rather a good sound knock from
redoubtable JAMIE Dow.

STRIKES THAT PAY.
THE following extract from a contemporar
seem to indicate that, as to dearth of fuel and
we have companions in distress:–
“THE OL STRIKEs.—A Correspondent, writing to a Boston paper, from
Petroleum County, Pennsylvania, says that the recent great strikes in the oil
regions have caused intense excitement.”
The idea thus suggested of an analogy between petroleum-diggings
and coal-mines is not at once dissipated by what follows:–
“At the oil towns of Pleasantville, Oil City, Reno, Franklin, Pithole, and
elsewhere, new wells are being started daily, which produce largely, and the
oil is of excellent quality. , Not only have these important strikes created
consternation, but the ‘flowing’ of the “dry holes’ made by disgusted pro-
!. in the days of the great oil fever of 1864 and 1
wonder.”
What are those “important strikes” which have “created con-
sternation”? If not strikes of petroleum diggers why consterna-
tion? From the remainder, however, in ourſ contemporary's
statement, it appears that “consternation” is, if not a clerical or a
typographical error, a Malapropriety; and the strikes which have
created the feeling of joyous excitement for which it stands are
strikes of oil, with which wealth-bringing fluid the oil towns of
Pleasantville are flowing, not, indeed, exactly as with milk and
honey, but rather like the celebrated river of Lydia, with gold.

“Tº be Let, permanently preferred, a Furnished Bed-room, in White
In the height of summer, when the nights are hot and sultry, we
can imagine that it might be a welcome relief to have the chance of
sleeping in a grotto; but, at this season of the year, when mornings
and evenings are ...i chilly, to pass whole nights in a White
Rock bed-room, even on the temperate South Coast, strikes us as an
uncomfortable, not to say dangerous, experiment. They must be a
very hardy race at Hastings and St. Leonards, for the expression
“permanently preferred” may be fairly taken to imply that the
proprietor of the bed-room would not be at all surprised to find

I'ouildi.
Qn a second reading, the words seem capable of another interpre:
tation—our Standing Čounsel is at Sittingbourne, so we are deprived
of the advantage of his opinion—and may mean that the furniture
of the bed-room is not the ordinar ogany, polished pine, or
painted deal, but white rock, which would, certainly, be clean,
cool, and ornamental.
CORPORATE IMPUNITY.
THE end of the * on the Wigan Railway accident is that
nobody is to be hanged, or placed in danger of being so, or of getting
penal servitude or imprisonment with hard labour. For—
“The jury returned a verdict of ‘Accidental Death,’ and added that the
London and North-Western Railway Company are not justified in allowing
engine-drivers to run through Wigan Station at so high a speed as was the
case with the tourist train on the night of the accident, and that it was desir-
able that the speed of fast and through trains should be materially slackened
on passing such places.” -
Suppose engine-drivers were not allowed to run with a dangerous
velocity through Wigan Station, and one of them nevertheless had,
and caused a fatal agcident, would the Coroner's jury have been
content with finding that he was not justified in doing so? Would
they not have returned a verdict of manslaughter against him, and
sent him to be tried for felony? But-even now, after the warming
iven as above to the Railway Company above-named, should that
º neglect the warning, and the result of their negligence be
another smash, and more º will any Coroner's jury, havin
had to sit upon them, so d with the masters as they would de
with the man?...What a thing it is to be a Director of a Railway
Company; for Coroners' juries never recognise the possibility of
Joint-Stock Manslaughter!

THE END of A Bookworm.—To be Buried in a Book.
A REPUBLICAN WARMING-PAN.
HAs not the newspaper paragraph subjoined a significance?—
“TITLE of MARSHAL MºMAHoN.—It is said that the title of MARSHAL
M“MAHoN has been somewhat discussed, and that it is proposed to style him
Lieutenant-General of the Republic.”
Lieutenant-General is a title which implies a Superior. The
Republic is a body politic, and not a person. He whom it is º
to style Lieutenant-General of the Republic is the Republic's
President. He stands in relation to the French Republic as the
Lieutenant of the Tower to the Tower of London. As a Lieutenant,
he is the Lieutenant or locum tenens of somebody. The Lieutenant
of the Tower is HER MAJESTY's. Is it not to be presumed that the
Lieutenant-General of the French Republic will be so entitled as
being considered, in that capacity, the locum tenens, ad interim
between Republic and Monarchy, of HENRI W.
ECONOMICAL EXBIAUSTION.
WHAT signifies this newspaper paragraph?–
“CoALs ExpoRTED.—It appears from an official document just issued
that the declared value of coals, &c., exported in the last eight months was
£8,755,831. In the corresponding period of the previous year it was
£5,940,785.”
It is true that the proverbial prodigal was thought a very extra-
vagant fellow for burning his candle at both ends. Nor even can it
be denied that, on a superficial view, the extravagance which he
committed in so doing was, as compared to ºi. with
light and heat at the rate above indicated, whilst our own coals at
home are at famine prices, stinginess itself. To dream, however, of
putting any check on the progressive exhaustion of our coal-beds,
#. by the . figures, is really, in the unshaken
judgment of commercial philosophers, and statesmen of enlarged
views, forbidden by economy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OCCASIONAL HAPPY THOUGHTS.
Still bent on the purchase of a Horse. Plans.
PPORTUNELY in the interim
between this conversation
with GLOPPIN and myinter-
view with CLUMBER, the
Flyman, I spend to the
best advantage in obtain-
ing information as to horses
generally.
The reports about the
prices of horses just now
are something alarming.
A casual acquaintance in
ºr a train has something to
ºf say on the subject. -
casual acquaintance I have
long taken to be of a
strongly sporting turn, for
three reasons: firstly, be-
long way out in the coun-
try; secondly, because, in
the summer, he wears a
white, hat with a black
bandroundit; and, thirdly,
because I don't know his
name, or his profession, or
business, if any; but, in a
generalway, Isuppose him
- - to be “something in
City,” and some only much more so, in the country, where I
can imagine him strolling through his stables with a cigarsticking
:*º: side of his mouth, his hat cocked on the other side of his
of oats, with the air of a man who had been taken in
once, but was nevergoing to be “ | alive” again.
At the same time, and on due consideration, I should not be
extraordinarily astonished were he to turn out to be the Cashier of
some Mercantile Firm, at work from nine till four regularly, with
ten days’ holiday in the summer.
Assuming him, however, to be of a sporting turn for the purposes|
"ß-B, a be
Happy 1ght.—By the way, to assume, everyone to be some-
thing merely for the purposes of conversation. Must lead to dis-
Cusslorl.
For example, assume a man to be a soldier; talk to him of the
latest invention in .*. (if sº can't), º
campaigns. co t Light aw. in
Abyssinia (if you know anything about it—I don't), and . -
He will join you satisfactorily for some time, then you can put such
a test-question to him as would tend to elicit his opinion with regard
to the probable expense of a. *...*.# º or" any such
isionally-military-sounding - really happen
to be in the , then he will i.
seem puzzled, and ask you “what the deuce mean?” in which
case, you can retire behind, your trenches (I haven’t, the faintest
notion what effect this would have on an enemy, but I’ve often met
the phrase in print, and like it), and ly beg to be pardoned
if your “phraseology” (use this word) is incorrect; or say “tech-
nically, incorrect,” which does look as if you had some acquaintance
with the subject—and add that you yourself are not a military
Inan.
Should he, however, have to excuse himself on the same score, you
Carl º high ground (all part of metaphorical field operations with
“trenches” and “high ground”), and observe that you had asked
for information, under the impression that he was in the Army.
This will flatter him, as a rule, and he may after this confide to you,
with a smile, that he travels in the wool trade.
Bappy Thought-fi so, look out for being fleeced. [N.B.-
Arrange this jeu de mot. £ut it down to sº. SMITH, or SHERI-
DAN, or THEópoRE Hook.]
This “ assumption for purposes of conversation” would really be
found a most entertaining ime for voyageurs. You can be
eccentric in your assumptions...Thus, meeting a gentleman in black,
with an imitation Roman collar, high ecclesiastical coat, and so
forth, you can ask him, “How's the dashi Ninety-fourth tting
on?” and º: he’s "... ...t. º: irritates him, be
provided with pince-nez; them ou ck them on your nose,
survey him from hat to heel, and : for short-sightedness.
Assume somebody you’ve never seen before in your life to be
LoRD_WUNBoRough, for example, whom also you’ve never set eyes
on. In the course of conversation on politics, say to him, with a
knowing twinkle, but preserving a deferential tone, “Yet I think
cause he lives, I believe, a .
balance the cigar, and inspecting everything, from a break ||
| to a handful
stick his glass in his eye, con
our Lordship voted on the ºpposite side last, Session.” He will
§h. smile, feel half inclined to accept the title, but honesty will
gain the victory over his innate snobbism, and he will reply, most
good-naturedly, “I think, Sir, Fº: mistake me for some other gen-
tleman.” He will not add, “I am not a Lord,” because to do so
would be to let himself down too suddenly from the pedestal where
you had d him. After this the conversation will flow easily,
and you’ll have made a friend of him for life. When he re-enters
the he’ll say to his wife, “Fancy, ELIZA, I
osom of his fº
was taken for LoRD WUNBoRough to-day. Absurd, wasn't it?”
His wife won't see anything absurd in it, and, on the whole, depend
upon it that, in this case, you’ve put husband and wife in a good
temper, and made a whole household .# for one evening.
Assume a Banker to be a distinguis Artist, and § be de-
lighted. Assume, an Artist to be a Queen's Counsel, and he’ll be
immensely pleased. Assume a gentleman at large to be the Secre-
*: to some foreign legation, with a secret mission, and

be highly gratified. Assume that a literary man would have
made a first-rate preacher, and that a philosophical writer would
have made his fortune if he had only stuck to the violoncello, and
you will increase the number of your friends:everywhere.
On the strength of these assumptions, they will everywhere speak
of you as a “deuced sharp chap,” a man who “sees below the
ace,” one who can “read you up,” and so forth. And why?
Because you’ve struck the key-note # that general dissatisfaction
which everyone feels, and which is the strongest reason for everyone
so working in his “station of life,” as to make the best of it.
[N.B.-The moral finish of the above paragraph is a specimen of
my º in T. p.ſ.º.º. Vol. VI., On Normal Causation
Socially Considered—and has not, of course, much to do with my
fº in search of a horse. Still, it occurred to me. Before now,
've been nearly two hours getting from Langham Church to
the Leicester Square, simply because people would button-hole me in
Regent. Street. And º Casual Sporting Friend was an
opportunity to put before the world my Theory of Gratuitous
Assumptions, which was not to be lost. Passons ! f
My Casual Acquaintance, the cause of the foregoing discursive-
mess, jºyº shaking his head,
“Ah'ſ horses are a price now. Why, you can't look at one under
eighty guineas.”
jeourse, as a fact, I have looked at one for less, and, to take it
literally, as merely meaning looking at a horse and nothing else, I
have loºked at one at several for nothing.
To be: always “going to look at a horse” is, by the way, the
most inexpensive way of getting a reputation for being “deuce
well off.”
“I went,” says my Casual Acquaintance, fiercely, as if recalling
the incident vividly to his own mind, and challenging any one to
contradict him, “I went to look at a mare at CHICK's place, over
the hill by Cooper's Gravel Pits, you know—”
I nod; so as to help him on: but I don't know. However, such
names as “CHICK's place” and “Cooper's Gravel Pits” have a
country-gentleman sort of ring about them, which, in a carriage
full of people, I would rather accept as matters of course than as
entire novelties taking me by surprise. -
My Casual Acquaintance being satisfied, or, appearing to be so,
tinues; “Well, when I to CHICK's, Old WILLIAM there—
look puzzled, feeling it won't do
r me to recollect everyone and everythi ith the same readiness
that I did “CHICK's.” and the “Gravel Pits,”—but he goes on to
explain, rather impatiently, that he means,
“Old Wrillam, who to be at the Kennels—”
* -º t.—0, yes; of course. The Kennels. . . .
[It's no use, after acknowledging “CHICK's,” &c., at first, to stick
at trifles, but I haven't a notion of what he’s alluding to. It
suddenly strikes me that º is proceeding on a theory of
Gratuitous Assumptions, and , as it were, he’s playing at
“taking me for somebody else.” Becautious what I admit.] |
He goes on, “I thought you’d recollect him,” meaning Old
WILLIAM, but I make no º being unwilling to go any further
into the mire. “Well, Old WILLIAM told me he’d got somethin
that 'ud suit me down to the ground. It was nice ..". and

“It's a fact,” he says, getting out, having to change carriages:
“and, if you’re going in for horseflesh now-a-days, by Jove! you ºli
have to pay for it. Good day.”

when, it appears, several people living in remote districts were so
anxious to get rid of horses (always exactly the sort I wanted, of
course) that they'd rather have given them away than been obliged
to keep them.

opportunities were lost for ever—as, indeed, they were.

A SONG FOR THE DULL SEASON.
By a Cockney Economist.
'Tis now the cheapest time of year
For all who hold a town life dear:
'Tis now the season when we may
Care little for what people say:
Wear shabby clothing an we please,
And live completely at our ease;
When tired . walking, take a bus,
Nor fear our friends will sneer at us;
At Greenwich treat our wife and imps
To frugal feasts of tea and shrimps;
Take economic trips to Kew,
ph \\ .
herº paºl
Or go on Mondays to the Zoo, .
Paying but sixpence for the yiew:
At theatres with cheapness sit,
If not with comfort, in the pit;
And e'en, for now no eye we fear,
Refresh our lips with ginger-beer.
Scant orders now our Cook receives;
Our dinner-table sheds its leaves:
If friends drop-in, pot-luck they take,
No fuss on their ..º. ;
No costly viands grace the board,
No dai inks we now ;
Cold mutton with content they eat,
And deem a pudding quite a treat.
If to the Park we fain would hie,
No button-hole bouquet we buy:
No gloves, or shabby ones, we take,
A.;boldly wear a wideawake: .
Bargain to get our chairs half-price,
And save a penny for an ice. -
In short, from morn till even chime,
To please ourselves is now our time.

“RELICs of LITERARY MEN.—Any

habitually used by CHARLEs LAMB, CoLºRunds, Byeon, &c., and willing

The “&c.” emboldens Mr. Punch, to inquire whether any of the
following interesting and valuable relics would be acceptable:—
The Table habitually used by FRANCIs (“Old”). MooRE, M.D.,
when engaged in the preparation of his Almanacks. The green
baize is covered with curious pen-and-ink astrological figures and
. Two of the legs have been cut with a pocket-knife,
probably by one of the young MooREs in a playful mood.
The Desk habitually used by MR. Joseph MILLER to record those
famous jests, which have now been the property of many fortunate
ns. It has a large ink-spot in the middle, and in the
drawer there is aparchment document, certifying that the fluid was
spilt by MR. MILLER late in his career. Also the Table which he
Was Wont to set in a roar.
The Easy Chairin which RABELATs sat and shook. It has been
re-covered with American cloth more than once since RABELATs'
time, and the wood-work is of the I. century. The cushions
are wanting, the arms are gone, and the springs have disappeared;
but in all other respects (except that the gastors are º the
chair is:i. as it was when the great Gallican reclined in it, and
smoked his pipe in company with FENELON, and MonTAIGN.R. This
interesting relic can have a twelvemonth's guarantee from the
present possessor, who is E. with it because he is about to be
married, and the lady wishes to refurnish the house.
One of the Tables which it was the practice of Edward CocKER
to use when tºº. Arithmetic. No Addition has been made
to it since his time, but there is a Division down the centre, and
three of the legs have been Subtracted—it is traditionally believed
by some enthusiastic admirers of the great Arithmetician.
The legs of a table made by MR. CRusof, when living in the island
where he resided for many years in solitary isolation. On one of
them the letter “F” has been º carved with some sharp
instrument, and all the antiquaries to whom this curiosity has been
shown pronounce it to be FRIDAY's initial, cut by his own hand.
The top of the table is, unfortunately, missing, but it is believed to
bein the possession of another branch of the family. Iffort -
it will be included in the Conveyance.
The reticule. MRs. GRUNDY was in the habit of carrying on her arm
when she paid visits to her friends and neighbours. #. is in the
possession of a lady who has a distinct recollection of hearing her
other relate how well her mother remembered the profound
impression the memorable words “What will MRs. GRUNDY say?”
used to make in the country circles in which they both moved as
contemporaries.
The broomstick on which DEAN Swift composed his well-known
meditation. It has been handed down from generation to genera-
tion, and is rather the worse for wear. Very suitable for a Museum,
Mechanics' Institute, or Literary and Philosophical Society.
The steps by which the Reverend DR. Ax was enabled to
mount his horse, when leaving home on his equestrian tour.

a great reduction in the cost of dresses,” &c. We always stuck up

THE Conservatives are up and doing. One of them has sent
Mr. Punch a soul-stirring appeal, addressed to the Electors of
Deptford. They are informed—in reference to the late contest at
Shaftesbury—that “the Mantle of BoADICEA, Queen of the Iceni,
has fallen on the Dowager MARchiowess of WestMINSTER, ... She has
led you on,” proceeds the placard, “let not defeat come!”. If the
framer of this address had turned to the next age of his Pinnock's
Catechism, he would have found that he was favouring his friends
with a bad omen. Does not CowPER say something about a
“Druid,” and “a sweet but awful Liar?” We are quite sure that
the exemplary lady, whose name has been so ridiculously used,
would be the last to desire to imitate QUEEN BoADICEA, and to
exterminate her ... and it could be wished that some rudi-
mentary instruction, however slight, were considered necessary to a
rson who undertakes to stir politicians into action. Punch here-
y sentences the Writer of the Address to learn the Tennysonian
poem, Boadicea, containing the lines—
“Hear, Icenian, Catieuchlanian, hear Coritanian, Trinobant!
Up, my Britons, on my chariot, on my chargers, trample them under us.”

THE Paris Correspondent of the Morning Post observes:—
“One or two of the noble British pilgrims were at the races on Sunday.
They might have done worse.”

instance, instead of doing a little horse-worship, they might have
engaged themselves in bringing discredit, on #. by the practice of

MRs. MALAPROP is staying at an old farm-house, in
one of the Middling Counties, and writes word that it is
in a very “diplidated” condition.
*AM
FAITH AND FASHION.
MR. PUNCH,
LIKE one or two more people of my acquaintance, I am away
on a holiday, and the place of my temporary abode being very slow
and very fashionable, where excursion vans and trains are unknown
of course I follow the general example, and go to Church, and find
myself one of several hundred strangers, who are trying “to catch
the Werger's eye; ” which, by the bye, f find accomplished quickest
by those who carry their right hand in the waistcoat pocket.
I took the liberty of taking stock of my fellow occupants of
Pew 2000 on Sunday last. There were six in all (except a child,
who sat on a mat), including myself—the only male. No. One, at
the top, carried at least—as the Yankees say—“five hundred
dollars' worth of dry goods on her back;” and she had a little girl of
about six years old, like a little dancing dog, who carried in lace
another two hundred dollars' worth. There were, besides, her
mother's jewellery, parasol, scent-bottle, fan, and Prayer-book,
which was the most expensive, money could buy. She was a hand-
some woman, and divided her time between fanning herself,
arranging her necklace, which was very handsome and massive,
and using her gold-topped bottle.
Next to her sat an unmarried sister—very much ditto all round.
Next to the sister sat a charming, neat-looking, middle-aged,
. lady, who evidently adopts the modern very high style, and,
probably, was interested in the Baldacchino question—but simple
and quiet withal; though she bobbed about like a perch-float
towards sunset.
And, next to her, came two sisters. O, Mr. Punch, they were
two ladies—Grecian features, small heads, plainly plaited hair, no
chignon, small round brown straw hats, with simple ribbons of the
Same colour, trimmed with a little heather, and ornamented with
one small flower, perfectly plain dresses of indian cloth or brown
holland, made by themselves with a sewing-machine, were all the
attractions, except their faces, which they boasted. They looked
like two angels, and sang like angels too.
Then I thought to myself, suppose I was to marry that over-
dressed girl, No. Two in the Pew, what would º ? #.
has three hundred a year—the first thing she would do would be to
spend six hundred on dress, and cry for a carriage. . The trousseau
would, probably, not all be paid for; there would be a mob, of
millionnaires, and no end of speeches, at the wedding, and a regular
show-room of wedding, presents, all worth nothing, or next to
nothing, as regards, utility. By Jove! I would sooner take the
Ritualistic old maid!
Suppose I was to marry one of those angels, and that I had three
hundred pounds a year—she would make it go as far as I would
make five hundred. Probably they neither have any money, but
haven't they friends? . There would be wedding presents, too, and
useful ones—table-cloths from one uncle, a few º: from another,
a cheque for fifty pounds from the Squire of the Parish, a silver
tea-pot from the parishioners and Sunday-school children, and all
kinds of tokens of love and affection which simplicity and good
breeding always attract. - -
There, that's enough! Butlet me adyise young ladies who want
husbands to put not their trust in chignons and gimcracks, for
men don't like them, -

THE amount of electricity in the human frame must be much

Perhaps, this is only the first result of some new scientific discovery,
which will speedily supply us in succession with Electric Waiters,
Electric. Postmen, and Electric Policemen.

Welearn from a letter from Philadelphia,

threatened to hang him and burn the town, unless
KELLER was given up. According to the newspaper—
“The Sheriff had kept his prisoner hid, and endeavoured to
dissuade the mob; but they discovered the hiding-place, brought
out the murderer, and, taking him to the woods, hanged him
with very little ceremony.”
Then comes a piece of news from Louisiana, that two
men met at cº' Prairie to settle a duel with fists. A
crowd assembled, and a new quarrel arose which “re-
*| quired fire-arms for settlement”:—
“Pistols were drawn, and in almost an instant three men were
killed and a fourth mortally wounded. Among the killed was
one of the participants in the fist fight. The authorities inter-

not disappointed. In an instant DAN CALHoux was enveloped
in a sheet of flame, and, bounding to his feet with a yellofagony,
ran about like a deer, zig-zag, in the most ludicrous fashion.”
Of course the poor fellow died in the greatest torment,
and the three fiends have decamped.
“All the good citizens, it is stated, regret the circumstances

refused to issue a warrant for the arrest of WAugh AN, RUFFIN,

BEDLAM IN COUNCIL.
THE annual report of the Commissioners in Lunacy, as quoted by
the North British Daily Mail, contains, in a description of the
management of the parochial asylum of the Abbey Parish of Paisley,
the following statement:—
“Last winter a debating society was organised among the men, and it is
said to have been a source of great amusement. At the meetings of this
society the Governor presides, but the discussion is conducted entirely by the
patients, the inmates who are not members of the society forming the
audience. The discussion of the question, “Whether Lunatic Asylums are
really an advantage to the country,’ occupied two sittings, and was
the affirmative by a small majority.”
A debating society, organised amongst lunatics, is one whose pro-
ceedings are only too likely to be a source of great amusement to
persons apt to be gratified by speech and demeanour which disgust
or sadden those of whom t igher feelings are more acute than
their sense of the grotesque. To people of the latter kind, the
debates of such an association must frequently present scenes almost
as painful as those which occur almost every day in the French
National Assembly. . Only the lunatics enjoy, or, at least, possess,
the advantage of having for President the Governor of their institu-
tion, who knows how to enforce order.
The decision that iumatic asylums are really for the advantage of
the country, carried by a small majority of lunatic asylum patients,
seems to show that sane counsels prevailed, though by a few voices,
among the insane, and thus that the debaters, or, at least, the
voters, of unsound mind were outnumbered by the convalescent.
Otherwise the Lunatics' Debating Society would, perhaps, have
decided the question as to the advantage of lunatic asylums in the
negative, and have passed a resolution that, to render them really
advantageous to the country, their inmates ought to be all let out,
and the community at large shut up in their place.
Among subjects for early discussion by the Lunatics' Debating
Society at Paisley, may be suggested the question, “Whether the
Earth is a Disc?” as it is maintained to be in a pamphlet by a
ided in
philosopher signing himself “PARALIAx.”. If they were to argue
this point, probably, unless the convalescents mustered very strong,
“PARALLAX
's” idea of the flatness of the Earth would be affirmed.
TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY AND HISTORICAL PAINTERS
IN GENERAL,
A HANDsoME piece of Plate, to be selected from any crockery
barrow in the Tottenham Court. Road, on any Saturday night, is
offered by us to any Historical Painter who will paint “The Parting
of the DUKE of WELLINGTON and His Majesty GeoRGE THE FourTH
at their Last Interview previous to the Passing of the Catholic itelief
Bill.” The Picture must faithfully represent the scene described in
the Fifth Volume of the Despatches and Correspondence of Arthur
Duke of Wellington (lately reviewed in the Times). His Majesty
must be painted in his oiliest brown wig, and in tears—and the dear
old Duke's nose must stand out boldly in the foreground.
. . . . “The Duke represents his interview with the King to have been
very painful indeed. The King was in a very agitated state, and even º:
of abdicating. The Duke said it was the more I. in consequence of the
very peremptory language he was obliged to hold to him. However, the King
was very kind, and kissed him when he left him.”
Very True.
THE bell-ringers of Chesterfield, and those of Alcester, near
Redditch, are reported to have struck, because they are required to
ring extra peals without extra pay. When Macbeth said to his
attendant–
“Go, bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell.”
he meant his wife to be requested to do exactly the reverse of that
:* th: bell-ringers now on strike have done in striking. Mark
you that!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DREAM OF FAIR THEATRES.
oNSIDERATEMR.PUNCH,
AHAPPY thought
occurs to me. I think
of waking some fine
morning, and, while I
sit at breakfast, find-
ing in my newspaper
a paragraph like this—
“CoNscIENCE MoREY.
—The CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER ac-
knowledges the receipt
# £20 from ‘ ...;
eeper,’ on account o
fees which have been
fraudulently exacted
from the public.”

mature, but Imay live

enough. And I may
likewise live to see
º, i. al *::::

all cº, *ā. I
†† my second egg-
shell:—
“SHAKSPEARE STREET Pop/CE Court.—The worthy sitting Magis-
trate, MR. RHADAMANTHUs MINos, stated that he had received by
F. a cheque for £50, which he was requested to put into the poor-
X, being a return of a small portion of the money lately paid for
booking places at the Royal Claptrap Theatre.”
These º * of mine have in some measure been suggested
% my reading a few words about the management of theatres,
whence I extract the following as worthy of your notice:—
“The absurdity of calling upon visitors to a theatre to pay extra charges
for taking the trouble of gi the manager an assurance that they intend to
be present must be .."; I go to a restaurant and order dinner for a
party of six, a table is kept ready for us at the appointed hour, without any
additional cost to me, and with the risk to the proprietor of our not appearing.
At the box-office of a theatre I pay the money in advance, and, should the
weather or any untoward event prevent our attendance, the manager has the
price of six seats in his till. The charge for bills is even more irrational than
the charge for booking. If one were to go to a restaurant and ask the waiter
what he could have to eat, he would be more than surprised if that functionary
held out the bill of fare in one hand and demanded a shilling in the other for
the information required. Yet at a theatre the visitor does not wonder at
being called on to give a fee to learn what he has paid to see.”
Now, really, Mr. Punch, is such a system fair? You know, a
shilling fee for booking, and a shilling to the Cerberus on duty at
the door, add twenty-five per cent. to the price paid for your seat,
and if you do not “wonder” at sueh rapacious blackmail, you at
least are apt to growl. Fº if your tailor were to clap on a per-
centage for h g you his bill, because you wished to pay before
he sent in your new suit!. Or imagine, if *." paid a visit to your
dentist, ºf asked to give a shilling to the footman at the door
Such brigandage is only to be met with at the theatre, and when we,
are more civilised it surely be suppressed.
If one may credit the advertisements, the
- drama never was *
flourishin
n it is at present... Crowded houses, great attractions,
un. ed successes, are daily penny-trumpeted thro the
penny papers: and every week some splendid triumph is (said to be)
withdrawn prematurely, in the heyday of its glory, to make room
for another which the next week will be advertised as more trium-
phant still. Managers indeed appear to be afflicted with embarrass-
ment of riches, and to hold, so many trumps that they know not
which to play. Butalas! all is not gold that glitters on the Stage,
and theatrical advertisements are hardly more veracious than the
puffs of other wares. Late dinners and home comforts are direful
riyals of the Stage, and if I were a Manager I should study first of
all to make my house attractive by making it accessible, without
causing loss of temper by such paltry petty larcenies as those I have
described.
With which wise hint believe me, bowing to your own superior
worldly wisdom, Yours in all humility,

SAVAGES IN CLUBS.
WoRTHY MR. PUNCH,- - -
The savage custom of chewing toothpicks is still practised
§ some members of this civilised community, and causes daily
shudders to people like myself who are delicate of nerve. The
barbarity of eating peas wº the assistance of a knife is barely more
revolting than this brutal practice; and yet persons of fair standing;
I regret to say, indulge in it. At the Club which I frequent I could
point you out a score of fellows, all of decent family, and otherwise
of wholly irreproachable demeanour, who unhappily are slaves to
this abominable habit. In the pauses of a º and for at least a
mauvais quart d'heure after its conclusion, you see their horrid
instruments F. from their jaws; and they pay no heed
whatever to the suffering of fellow-creatures who may sit contiguous.
For my own part, I protest I would as lief behold tobacco chewed as
toothpicks at the dinner-table, and I wish with all my heart that
dining-rooms were set, apart for men who are addicted to this
offensive practice, and that in the other chambers of the Club there
were placards in iarge letters of “No Tooth-PICKING wºn.”
Beseeching you to lay your cudgel on the shoulders of the culprits,
I have the honour to remain
Your most obedient Servant,
BLACK BALL.
P.S.—I am told there are some monsters who will perpetrate this
dreadful act in society where there are ladies present, and who
have even been detected brandishing their weapons, as a savage
would his tomahawk, in the doorways at a ball. Such outrages are
too atrocious for description, and, as their perpetrators must be
wholly lost to proper i. it were idle to endeavour to reclaim
them to humanity. -
So, with virtuous indignation, Ileave them to their fate.
SAINTS AND SECULARISTS.
THE Dissenters and their friends, constituting the, National
Education League, aggrieved by having to - their com-
pulsory mites to a system of education not, uniformly and wholl
exclusive of instruction in the doctrines of the Church of England,
may yet derive some consolation from the following item of intelli-
gence, happily foreign:-
“RELIGIous Epucation IN FRANCE:-The Prefect of Lyons has sus-
pended six Schoolmistresses and one Schoolmaster for not having given
religious instruction to their pupils. He has also, for similar reasons, inter-
dicted three Mistresses and six Masters from exercising the profession of
teaching.”
Even the Wesleyan Conference has decided that, “in justice to
the interests of National Education in its broadest sense, and to the
different religious denominations of the country,” School Boards
ought, as a contemporary says, “to be everywhere established, and
an undenominational school placed within reasonable distance of
every family.” The Methodists, and all other conscientious Dis-
senters, may congratulate themselves that there are no Prefects in
England to suspend Schoolmasters and Schoolmistresses for keeping
“undenominational schools.” Here, in this happy andfayoured land,
all those religious denominations at least enjoy the blessedness of
beholding undenominational schools conducted freely by undenomi-
national teachers—a consolation, if not a satisfaction, which they
share with their associates of a denomination which signifies no
religion at all.
THE ANTIDOTE TO CRIME.
THE Times, in a column of paragraphs, publishes:-
“AN Explanation.—Qut of 1348 youthful offenders committed last year
to Reformatories, 631 could neither readnor write.”
The young rogues, therefore, who could not read and write, were
in a decided minority. Those who could, exceeded them by a
majority amounting to eighty-six. This, to be sure, is not quite a
conclusive proof that education promotes crime. Still it cannot, but
suggest the conjunction of the three R's with another R, to which
they have hitherto been assumed to be entirely antagonistic, but
may now be regarded as at least associated with it in the phonetic
alliteration of Reading, 'Riting, 'Rithmetic, and Roguery.
Very Thoughtful of Him.
HER MAJESTY's carriage journey to Inverlochy was performed
during heavy rain. En route, The MACKINTosh and his Clan
received HER MAJESTY. This was a case of the right man in the
right place, and no mistake.

Thou, scowling with just hate, behold'st them go,
Indignant at unmerited mischance,
Which brought on thee unutterable woe.
Who, that a generous idea could frame,
To fight for, shared thine anguish not with thee?
Who but partakes thy fury, as thy shame;

She spurned the honour of thy visitation;
Thy legions, on their march beneficent,

Thus with a crime repaid a compliment.
Now she retires, and leaves thee to repair

To brood upon revenge: or to beware

CONFUSION OF IDEAs.
THE man who said that he was so particular about his bacon that
he never ventured on a rasher without first seeing the pig.which had
supplied it, must have been an Irishman.
EXPERIMENTAL DISCIPLINE.
GEORGE PILLARD, bricklayer and habitual robber, convicted at
the Central Criminal Court for the robbery of a watch, accompanied
§ the violence of striking the man whom he robbed a tremendous
blow behind the ear with a loaded walking-stick, and sentenced to
fifteen years' penal servitude and two floggings of twenty lashes
each, received flogging number one in Newgate on Saturday morning
last week. He bore the punishment without howling, but not
perhaps without pain, although with bravado. . According to a
report of his whipping, “at the end of it he coolly asked to have
the remaining twenty lashes given him then and there.” He pro-
bably knew that the terms of his sentence did not allow this request
to be granted. Whether he meant it or not, he was led back to his
cell, there to meditate during the next six months on the prospect
of the second chastisement which he will receive at the end of that
period. Wery likely, however, he would rather have had it all over
at once; and it is satisfactory to find that judicial physicians have
fully discovered the importance, in order to the thoroughly effica-
cious administration of the lash, so as to affect the feelings of a
brutal ruffian as much as possible, of dividing the doses. This
arrangement has the further very great advantage that, if the first
dose, as in the case of MR. PILEARD, has apparently not produced
the desired effect, due care may be taken that a more powerful arm,
and . improved cat-o'-nine-tails, shall render the second strong
enough.
Sparkling Suggestion.
THE practice of *::::::: tea with iron-filings might, one
would think, be easily detec * dipping a magnet of sufficient
power into the suspected article. There is a variety of tea which,
so adulterated, might, having been confiscated, it has been suggested
by an inmate of Earlswood, be utilised instead of being Wn
away. His idea is, that as filings of iron are much used in pyro-
techny, materials for making fireworks are composed by the mixture
of iron-filings and gunpowder.

Bay to the Great Gorm's Head, be well secured from the wind, close to the

Before you come to terms, which should invariably cover all extras, ask a few
questions as to the Fº occupants of the rooms, the age of the furniture,
and the character of the neighbours on either side and over the way; and, dº
not conclude the bargain until you have ascertained that the house is furnished
with a filter, a fire-escape, an aneroid, barometer, and a powerful achromatic
telescope suitable both for marine and astronomical observations. You may
spend a day or two in search of º possessing all these indispensable
requisites, but when you have found them, you will be well rewarded for your

Roses, and the side it took in the struggle between CHARLEs. THE FIRST and the

You will, of course, bring with.you from home, hampers, and chests, and

WELL-EARNED REPOSE.
. THE Government has not chosen to adopt the sugges-
tion of raising MR. CALCRAFT to the Peerage on a retiring
ension; and the other day an accident ensued. It is
igh time that the aged Finisher of the Law was pen-
sioned off, for at his time of life he cannot be expected
to go on finishing it with the finish which once distin-
guished his execution.
Intellectual vigour, however, may survive manual
dexterity; and Čaroºr, if not ion CALCRAFT,
or Lond Dº Noos, or EARL HEMTsIEAp, might easily
earn a#: income by : about and delivering lec-
tures illustrated with model apparatus; thus, minis-
tering to a refined popular taste. Crowds would pay to
go and hear him.
Another means by which MR. CALCRAFT could doubt-
less make money would be the sale of his portrait,
photographed in various attitudes and sizes. Very many
people would make a º: of procuring it. At present
there is no photograph of MR. CALCRAFT in any of the
shop-windows, although there are not a few sun-drawn
pictures of persons on whom the exercise of his office
would be a benefit to Society.

Name and Nature.
THE City Press, in a brief account of the Tichborne
family, states that it was one of great county influence
in Hampshire before the Norman Conquest, and men-
tions that “the name of Doughty came into the family
in 1829 in lieu of Tichborne,” and that the two names
were finally conjoined as Doughty-Tichborne in 1853.
The motto of the Tichborne Arms, according to our Civic
contemporary, is Pugna pro patriá. If, as was doubtless
the case, the Tichboºmes were ever true to their motto,
they were always, from the time they began to practise
it, and long before the names of Tichborne and Doughty
came to be amalgamated, Doughty Tichbornes.

TEAS AND TEASPOONS.
THE convivial gathering, which, instead of a dinner, Dissenters
and Teetotallers are accustomed to hold for the purpose of discussion
or demonstration, is, in their characteristic phraseology, called “a
tea; iſoes not the term "a tea,” thus applied, sound unpleasantly
like nonsense? Do you not feel that they might as we *8. a
coffee?” And why not sometimes meet at “a coffee,” too? ffee
is specifically “the sober berry.” Further confounding general
with particular ideas, and reckless of absurdity, people might talk
of “a sugar ’’ or “a milk”f What would anyone, hearing for the
first time of “a tea,” understand by it? Surely some special
description of tea, distinguished in commerce, as Pekoe, or Kaisow,
or Assam. “A tea,” if you did not know what it meant, would be
as indefinite as “a spinach.” It is also an ambiguous expression.
When two teas and a brandy-and-water, as the waiter said, were
getting over the palings, one of the teas was “a tea.” Of course the
brandy-and-water must have been a great scandal to his honest
associates the teas, if they were Teetotallers. In Paris waiters talk
# t un grog anglais.” Accordingly, “a tea” should signify a cup
or tea.
The Spiritualists are wont to practise necromancy at what they,
too, call “a tea.”—-and, the other day, according to one of their
organs, the Spirits laid “a tea’’ out for them. Spiritualists appear
to share with Teetotallers and Nonconformists the mental condition
indicated by habitually speaking and king of “a tea.” Aver-
sion to Spirits other than ghosts is professed by many Spiritualists;
and Spiritualism and Teetotalism are often united.
“A tea,” in dissenting and teetotal #". may be said to
mean an evening meal of which the fluid portion is tea, and the
solids principally consist of bread-and-butter, muffins, crumpets,
and cake. e origin of the expression “a tea,” in this sense, ma
be guessed to have been Yankee and feminine.' Tea is a drink sai
to cheer but not inebriate; but “a tea” not uncºmmonly §:
effects more than simply exhilarating. Under the head of “Shirley,”
the Hampshire Independent publishes the following piece of local
intelligence:–
“Good TEMPLARs.-The Ray of Hope Lodge of Good Templars, esta-
blished at the village hall, purposed having a procession on Tºº.
last, followed by a public tea and meeting; but man proposes and the weather
disposes; for the procession did not take place owing to the heavy down-pour
of rain. About one hundred sat down to tea, after which, the weather having
cleared, a procession of the officers and a few of the Members, in regalia, was
formed, headed by the fife and drum band of the Lodge, and paraded the
principal streets, returning to the village hall, when addresses on the objects
of the Society were delivered # several speakers to a crowded audience, pre-
sided over by MR. I.UKE. The addresses were interspersed by songs by
several Members of the Lodge.”
The Good Templars, some of them, did still have their procession
—after tea. Ordinary people might make such an exhibition of
themselves after brandy-and-water. Who could march about the
streets in “regalia,” preceded by drums and fifes, for the º:
of proclaiming their personal habits in respect of drinking, sober *
Surely the tea of the Teetotallers who commit this sort of extrava-
º must be very ºl; and the Good Templars may
ave established a Ray of Hope º: ; but it is to be feared that
there is not even a ray of hope for them at Shirley; If, however,
“a tea,” unqualified, is sufficient to make some people tipsy, it may
be said that teas are the Agapat of milksops.
The Turf and the Till.
WE are, as a nation, accused by foreigners of worshipping the
golden calf. That idolatry is doubtless practised to a great extent
in England, but horse-worship also extensively prevails, and the
devotees of the golden calf, if as assiduous, are not so enthusiastic
as those of the golden colt. . There is, however, a daily increasin
number of Britons who combine those two objects of veneration, an
adore them both.

Accorping to the Conte Cavour of Turin, the Italian

in use at present. This announcement is likely to create

F. explain that the Prussian helmet is adopted, not
ecause it is Prussian, but because it is spiked; that no
offence is meant by the spiked helmet to any but the

HAPPINESS WITH ECONOMY.
THE BISHOP of LICHFIELD, the other day, in a speech on laying a
foundation-stone, took occasion to point out the necessity of meeting
high prices by the reduction of personal expenditure. Unfortu-
nately, the necessary reduction of personal expenditure involves, in
all particulars except one, the necessary reduction of personal
enjoyment—at least, a Briton's. On the other side of the Channel,
human nature may appear to superficial observers different from
what it is here. T #iºn said that:-
“Those who had been in France had seen that the Frenchman could be as
happy with his eau sucré as the Englishman with his champagne.”
But a little thought would have convinced them that the equality
of happiness they had seen depended on the º: of gratification.
If a §. is as º on eau sucré as an Englishman is on
champagne, it is because he likes eau sucré as much as champagne.
Happiness arises from, and is directly proportionate to, pleasure, or
the hope of pleasure, without pain or the fear of pain; and
diminishes exactly as we are obliged to stint ourselves in the enjoy-
ment of good things. The one ;particular in which it is possible
to retrench with unabated piness is ostentation ; and that
retrenchment is possible only for a philosopher, who does not care
about appearances, or, if he have any regard for them, can reason
himself out of it. But not even a philosopher can reason himself
out of delight in wine, or into satisfaction with sugar and water.
He may cut down his tailor's bill with equanimity, but, unless he
loves Australian meat as much as English, he will grieve in curtail-
ing his butcher's, and will prune his wine-merchant's with sorrow.

But the movement must not go too far—it must not
extend to “cooking” accounts.
SPIRITS AND FOOLS.
WHAT more than has been already said a thousand times over can
be said of the “shocking affair” which, in substance, has happened
times out of number, related, as below, by a contemporary, under
the heading of “ fatal Foolishness?”"six navvies were assemble
at a house in Bettws Garmon, a hamlet near Carnarvon. Their day's
work was over, “and they commenced to play” games with each
other. Two played at soldiers:—
“One of them, a member of the Carnarvonshire Militia, named CHARLEs
WILLIAMs, a native of Carnarvon, took up an old gun and began to go through
the drill with a companion, who was also a Militiaman. WILLIAMs was
ignorant of the fact that the º was loaded. He cocked it, brought it up to
his shoulder, presented it at his comrade's head, took steady aim, and fired.
His comrade fell down a corpse, the ball having passed through his head.
Wºº voluntarily came on to Carnarvon and delivered himself up to the
police.”
It may be thought that the foolishness of this kind of act, which
fools keep repeating, as the moth and the daddylonglegs repeat that
of flying into the candle, cannot possibly be further set forth than
it has repeatedly been. Perhaps that is so; but there is a folly in
connection with it which, those who are likely to commit, or may
be able to Hº! at least, have not had so frequently pointed out
to them. That is the folly of leaving a gun about loaded, which is
conditional to the foolish act of letting it off. A gun could hardly
be fired, in foolishness, at a companion by one fool, if it had not
been left about loaded by another fool.
... The fool who, leaves about a loaded gun, and the fool who pulls
its trigger, or the º of any gun, whether loaded or not, whilst
the gun covers anybody whom he does not mean to shoot, are nearly
as great fools, one as the other. But the latter of those fools is
something worse than a fool; for covering anyone with a and
drawing the º even knowing it to be unloaded, is shooting
that person in idea, and that idea is a vicious and criminal, one in
#. º ought, perhaps, in act, to be rendered more punishable
larl lù 18.
Fools are now-a-days very sceptical, many of them; otherwise
but that superstition is objectionable, and should not be practised
upon even for a good purpose, any who really believe in “Spiritu-
alism” might be deterred, at least from º: guns º: to
o somet oad
be unloaded, by the suggestion that demons imes ulls
d that lie in their way in order that fools may shoot people with them
in fun. Guns y believed to have been discharged before they
were put by, are, as a matter of fact, on examination now and then
found to bºioaded ; and this, probably, has really been the work of
evil or idiotic spirits—in the bºdy.
BRENTFORD THE DIRTY.
To be ashamed of a course is usually a sign that it will be aban-
doned. Brentford is actually showing shame that it is the dirtiest
place in Middlesex. We have hope for Brentford. But it has a
pedigree of dirt. SHENSTONE wrote of it—
“As when through Brentford Town, a Town of Mud,
A herd of bristly swine is pricked along,
The filthy beasts, that never chew the cud,
Still groan and grunt, and moan their troublous song.”
In the remote days of that pleasant Shepherd, Brentford was
famed for its mud, and its name suggested a picture of piggishness.
It is still dirty. But there are symptoms of reform, and some da
the Two Kings may have a cleaner domain, and not find it needf
to smell so often at their one nosegay, to get rid of the Neapolitan
odours of their unsavoury Capital, and Middlesex's.

house which he occupies in Skimpole Street, Cavendish Square. He
was objected to by both the Liberal and the Conservative agent, and

months with hard labour. If you mean it for a compliment, you’re
another. Now, get on, get on. I really cannot allow the business
of the Court to be delayed in this manner. Remember, we owe a
duty to the public, and we should endeavour to proceed with work
as rapidly as is compatible with the interests of justice, than which,
as CICERo says, in a passage which you may recollect, for I don't,
nothing can be more divine. Will you go on ? Why do you object
to JINKs of the Blue Cravat?

not become respectable solicitors. Do you know the pretty music,

“I am not a baker.”

before. I have seen an octopus, though, and many other things.

bution of cards at whist, or othergames; likewise a town near Dover.
Mr. Punch. There’s one game, Sir, that you will do well to
avoid, and that is trifling with the Court. Now, as this Dissenter,
who, all the same, seems to me. a most respectable man, and an
honour to his chapel, will not tell us about JINRs, perhaps you will
be so-good. Is the poor man to stand there with a blue cravat and
lacerated feelings all day?
Mr. Jinks. Iamºnot exactly a poor-man, Sir. Men with houses
in Skimpole-Street are usually rich men. But I forgive you, as you
meant well.
Mr. Punch. No living-man shall forgive me, Sir. How dare
you? Take back your forgiveness this moment. I did not mean
well. Let well alone. I begin to think that you are objectionable.

the moral is the same. Well.

Mr. Punch. And is this the Nineteenth Century?
Conservative Agent. I am not on oath, Sir, but, if you ask me my
impression, I believe that it is, because the last was the Eighteenth.
Mr. Punch (smiling). Now that’s a very curious fact, and you
reason from it very ingeniously. But I forgot, I was in a rage. I
was going to ask, with becoming indignation, whether in the nine-

to declare his intentions. (Aside. A deuced neat sentence that.)

eaten by lions and tigers and missionaries and cassowaries, and you
claim a vote in his name. In the whole annals of crime Inever read
anything so atroeious. Satan-I mean Saturn, devouring his
offspring, was the Prodigal Son’s father compared to you. Your

N º British Association,
º must have been enter-
tained, if not in-
structed, by some part
at least of what he
heard there. Accord-
ing to the Morning
- Post, DR. FERRIER, in
the course of narrating
a series of well-con-

which he afterwards,
- not without reason
==- said he thought “would

Fºlºs." observed
t :—
“The frontal part of
- the brain was broader and
- r in man than in
the monkey and other animals, which no doubt corresponded to the intellectual de-
velopment.”
On the address which included this passage its learned reader received the
cºngratulations of DR. CARPENTER, who said that “science ought to be proud
of such experiments as those described in it. This other distinguished phy-
siologist added that—
“He believed, along with DR. FERRIER, that the intellectual faculties of man were in
the posterior portion of the brain—a theory directly opposed to phrenology, which placed
ºnal functions at the back, and the intellectual faculties at the anterior part of the
Taln.
The Times represents DR. CARPENTER as saying that—
“He had long since expressed his disbelief in phrenology in an article that had had the
credit of killing the Phrenological Journal, which maintained that the animal faculties
were placed at the back of the head, and the intellectual at the front.”
*
S tomical and Physiolo-
| If DR. CARPENTER killed the Phrenological Journal
with an article, long ago, he also, by anticipation, killed
another bird with the same stone. He §. so much
of DR. FERRIER's paper as he contradicted. Of course
he killed it without having shot at it. Apparently
he did not hear it; or, rather, imagined that he had
heard exactly the reverse of it. is is, if correct,
remarkable in connection with the circumstance that:—
“DR. GeoRGE HARLEY con PRofessor FERRIER
on the able address he had delivered. He was sure that every
one in the room, whether possessed of scientific knowledge or not,
had perfectly understood the subject.”
So it seems; to judge of everybody by DR. CARPENTER.
DR. HARLEY_appears to have agreed with DR. CAR-
PENTER as to º He observed that, “along
with science there had always gone a pseudo-science.”
As reported in the Times, however:-
“DR. BRUNToN alluded to the faculty of will and self-restraint
as distinguishing man from the lower animals, and said that
this was F. in the anterior part of the brain. It
was noticeable that criminals, who were deficient in that faculty,
possessed only a small portion of brain in the front of the head.”
Behold how diametrically doctors differ about the
functions of the brain. Are the intellectual faculties in
the front and the animal at the back of it, or vice versá 2
That is their little diversity. Along with science, truly,
“there has already gone a pseu -
-science; ” but on
which side is the pseudo-science in the case of physiolo-
ists who differ from each other, as Big-endians from
ittle-endians, or as white from black?
Of course DR. CARPENTER's supposition that the in-
tellectual faculties of man are situated in the posterior
º of the brain cannot have been evolved out of
is own consciousness. Clairvoyants are said sometimes
to see at the back of the head; but DR. CARPENTER,
though a man of science, if not pseudo-science, does
not appear to be a clairvoyant. It would also seem that
the learned Doctor is yº, far from being a clairaudient,
unless either he, or DR. FERRIER, has been mis-
reported. - - -
A physiologist's opinion respecting the relation in
which §. intellect and the animal feelings lie fore and
aft in the brain may perhaps, even if Phrenology is false,
depend on the shape of his own head. As to Phrenology,
however, suppose it false; still every philosopher has
a vigorous faculty, if no organ, of “Comparison.” An
such an one must have been able to appreciate, wit
. amusement, the above-collated differences between

Our fighting forces scattered 1
'Tis hard to look facts in the face,
When they are so unpleasant;
Hard, the five-years'—since-past to place
In contrast with the present:
But harder still, when, to deny
Conservative Reaction,
Is to admit that Low E and I
Have not giv'n satisfaction.
Hardest of all to feel the shot
That bowls our Generals over,
Comes from our own ranks, oft as not,
With ballot-box for cover:
That those who used to hoist our flag,
Forget its place in story;
Till Liberal wishes for the drag
Are quite as strong as Tory.
Is it that Red Republic's tricks,
And Yankee revelations,
Lead BULL the “most advanced” to fix
As the “least favoured” nations?
Is it that Unions, workmen-led,
Don't go to prepossess him,
For the time, when, hand over head,
King Mob comes to redress him *
“THE NEWEST GRIEF l’”
Is it that, looking round the world,
Of chequered lots, means, rank, full,
His wings of aspiration furled,
He sighs, “Rest and be thankful; ”
Doubts H. all too bright to last,
Whistles too dearly paid for;
too fast,
If progress may not
R.f. should not be stayed for.
Is it that, starting, all abreast
A burst of “burning” questions,
BULL and BRITANNIA I’ve o'er-prest,
And o'er-taxed their digestions:
That Irish hates by boons increased,
I've got myself more trouble in : .
Have Parson lost, yet not gained Priest,
Snubbed Derry, nor won Dublin.
Is’t that I’ve not held high our flag
To “Rule BRITANNIA’s ” thunder 2
When others played the game of “brag,”
Have rather knuckled under P
Have let Old England, fighting shy,
Down in the scale of nations,
And baked JoHN BULL more humble pie
Than he could eat with patience 2
Or that I’ve kept, for little wars,
The pluck that big ones frightened;
And through my very fear of jars
The danger of them heightened?
Have sent the Army to Old Boots,
In new ways while inducting it:
And by short service scared recruits,
By way of reconstructing it?
Or that I’ve not shown game enough,
With licensed wittlers clashing?
That AYRTON's tongue has been too rough,
Or Bob Lowe's shears too slashing?
In short, is't for good deeds or bad,
Sins of o– or com-mission,
That the Pall Mall with me is mad,
BULL in such ill-condition?
Or is it but the destined end
Of too much praise to start with:
The recoil-kick of candid friend,
That for our good we smart with ?
Is it that I have been too just,
Till men's respect o'er-tried is,
And votes me out, in sheer disgust
As it did ARISTIDEs?
In any case, whate'er the cause,
The end comes near and nearer–
The closer Dissolution draws,
My vision waxes clearer:
Tory Reaction let it be,
Or Liberal Defalcation,
May Parliament's “Goodbye!” to me
Be “Good speed l’” to the nation.
Well, stand or fall, I’ve held the right
'Gainst blunder and defection;
The tº. who falls front to fight,
May hope for resurrection,
So, with hand on the helm of State,
Štediciad, sword-drawn, sedately,
Viking-like, I will meet my fate,
Up-standing, stern, and stately!

Our united ages amounted to—but this is unimportant, as we
were more than half-price on every line, and a child's ticket was
out of the question, though in La belle Grand's case it was at first
worth consideration. - -
Sir, when I travel, I travel with an object. I do not allude to
either of my companions, in making the above statement. One
object was, to compare great things with small—to compare, i. e.
the hotel, bills, of England-of mºry. England-with, those o
France, where live “our lively neighbours.”...Another object was
to note down the simplest, most effective, prettiest, and most satis-
fying-at-the-price dishes, and learn something in addition to the
knowledge of economising resources which I have already, in times
h , gained from a close observance of many a Continental table
ôte.
I chose Brittany.
I had been there and still would go.

If the cosmopolitan traveller, who would do in Rome, as the
Romans do, will insist on doing in Brittany as the Bretons do, then
if he has the good fortune to be travelling with his aunt, wife,
daughter, or grandmother, let him at once in fine weather, load her
with his Ulster coat, his umbrella, his rugs, his stick, his carpet-
bag, while he himself can lounge along the road with a cigar in his
mouth, and a light, joyous heart in his bosom.
. I pointed this out to my elderly relative, and rather than run the
risk of being burdened d la mode de Bretagne, she willingly paid for
coitures to wherever we wanted to go. The Ulsters and carpet-bags
were, as it were, hung in terrorem over her head. She was Mrs.

Though my object was, as already stated, to mark prices and
dishes, yet did I not think it necessary to investin a “Cook.” The
travelling tickets issued by this remarkable and energetic creation
of the nineteenth century tend to inundate the Continent with a
flood of omnivorous tourists, and, by consequence, tend to raise the
prices everywhere, and to Anglicise the hotel dinners; so that there
may be at last a second application of the old proverb, that
“Too many Cooks spoil the broth.” Such, Sir, is my own personal
and private opinion; I may be wrong; I often amwºn representing
myself, as on this occasion.

French towns as will find their equivalents in Chichester, Win-

country, I can have my bed-room (so furnished as to serve for a
sitting-room) on the first-floor, and a better—far better—breakfast,

For the benefit of intending tourists, let your own carpet-bagman
recommend this Hôtel de France at Dol, kept by MADAME RAWEAUD,
most amiable and charming of hostesses. ere my step-grand-
mother had a room in which she could have given a ball had she
been so minded, with four windows commanding good look-outs,
and altogether of a cleanliness which really ran godliness uncom-
monly hard. This chamber was two francs a day: first floor, mind,
only one-and-eightpence. At an English hotel, similarly situated,
for less accommodation I have paid nearly three times the sum.
I find on my arrival in England that MRs. KING at the British
Association Meeting has been trying to "induce us to combine our
resources and our sauces, live in one happy family, and attend more
carefully to the kitchen economy. Bless her heart! we needn't live
as “one harmonious whole” in order to...arrive at a consommé
“devoutly to be wished.” -
Let every lady when travelling note down certain dishes, find out
how they are made, and establish her own private cookery-book. A
franc here and there will be well spent in acquiring this knowledge.

FOLKESTONE.
BoAT arrived about the usual time. To the discontent of the
fashionable visitors, whose one excitement is to come down and
laugh at the afflicted passengers, only two persons were very ill,
and one of these, an old lady, retained strength enough to bonnet a

Crammed, but nothing to what is expected shortly. Lobsters in

sionists, who batter the glass with umbrellas. Seventeen bands all
playing at once on the Parade, nigger minstrels, organists, and

BATH. -
In consequence of the report that if the Liberals should be beaten
at Bath, the general election would take place in November, the
leaders of party on each side met, under a flag of truce, to consider
whether it would be better to fight, or to make things pleasant; It
was resolved that nothing ought ever to be made pleasant in Bath,
and a fight was determined on. A miracle was wrought at the hot
bath. Catholic lady's watch fell in, and when recovered was
found to be going, which had not been the case for a year. The
Catholics say that this is due to the consecration of the waters by
St. Odoacer; the Protestants allege that the hot water melted the
oil, and released the clogged wheels. Sermons, each way, will be
preached on Sunday.
YORK.
The old place is still haunted by little Mayors, but the big ones
have left. The Yorkshiremen audibly wonder at the smallness of
the picked specimens of municipality, but one Tyke who was too
critical received from a stalwart South-country Town Clerk - a
repartee between the eyes, and admitted, when he got up, that he
had better have held his tongue. The scramble at the refreshment
station is as delightful as ever, and numbers of ladies and children
went starving to the north, having been utterly unable to make their
way through the crowd of buriy and selfish excursionists.
SCARBOROUGH.
A lady, who used to be considered the leader of dress here, having
been in the habit of appearing in five different costumes daily, has
been entirely snuffed out by another lady, who changes her dress
eight times, and “wondered who that dowdy thing was that came
out after lunch exactly as she was dressed before it.” A retort,
which we will not at present repeat, occasioned what promised to be
a disagreeable interview.between male friends of each party, but on
its being ascertained that both were simply advertising certain
milliºs establishments, friendly feelings and a champagne lunch
ensued.

Nautical Intelligence.
THE Admiralty has issued a Circular warning those
whom it may concern that marriages heretofore wont to
be performed on board Her Majesty's Ships, on foreign
stations, by the commanding officer—no chaplain or
consul being in the neighbourhood—have been declared
not valid by the law officers of the Crown, and directing
that no marriage shall in future be solemnised on board
a Queen's Ship by the commanding officer. In a British
man-of-war, therefore, except by a parson, or consular
authority, for the future, no more couples, but ropes
only, are to be spliced.
WESTON-SUPER-MARE.
We regret to say that a collision between two British matrons has
occurred here, in consequence of one having accused the other of
surreptitiously obtaining (through a servant) MIss BRADDoN's last
novel from the lodgings of the aggrieved }. before she had done
with it. Very sensational language was freely used on both sides
and it is thought that the gentlemen of the long robe will find
increased employment in consequence.
RAMSGATE.
A, painful affair has taken place here. A gentleman, whose
London residence is not a hundred miles from the New Road, went
down to Ramsgate to join his wife, who had been lodging there some
days. Having omitted to notify his intention, he j that his
wife had gone out on an excursion with some friends, and that no
dinner had been ordered. He flew into a natural fury, left on the
table a card stating, that they would meet no more, #. several
looking-glasses, and a Parian statuette of Patience, and went to
Margate, where he became so intoxicated from grief and other
çauses, that he was locked up for the night. He will be brought
before the Magistrates to-day. His unoffending but penitent wife
returned to the scene of the catastrophe, merely observed “Just
like him,” gave his London address to her i. , and ordered
ickled salmon for supper. This shows that the frightful shock
d affected her mind, as the article is not in season.
EVERYWHERE.
A railway, accident took place near here, last night. We have
not, heard the particulars, but great damage was done, and in
applying for information the officials invited us to visit a district

STRONG-MINDED SOCIAL SCIENCE.
. . THERE are two subjects in connection with the Rights of Women, and their
i. which might have been discussed by the Social Science Congress, but
ave not.
Next year, perhaps, these omissions will be supplied; unless Progress shall
have anticipated the Reforms which have failed to be advocated. -
A paper then will, otherwise, perhaps, be read, º; the necessity for the
enactment of a Permissive Prohibitory Marriage Bill, to limit the number of
churches and other places licensed in any district for the celebration or perform-
ance of matrimony. In this essay will be pointed out and demonstrated, the
right of women to be protected from their own weakness, which makes them
consent to be reduced to matrimonial slavery. Attention will also be directed
to the need of a measure tending to limit the continually increasin º
which makes life less pleasant and more expensive every day, an , if not
checked, make #. so numerous as to be a burden to itself. , . -
An address will, perhaps, also be delivered by a lady endowed with superior
strength of mind, suggesting the expediency of extending Woman's mission by
employing women, ing and able to officiate, in the capacity of executioner.
For this step in the direction of Progress might be advanced the argument that
a task, in which all gentleness consistent with efficiency is desirable, would be
wisely intrusted to the gentler sex. An additional suggestion, that could be
made is that in pursuance of analogy, which couples the opposite sexes in the
antagonistic relation of marriage and that of dancing, MR. KETCH should have
his ministrations limited to female offenders, whilst the feminine Finisher of
the Law should be appointed to finish it upon good-for-nothing men.

LYRIC FOR LORD LUSK.
HE's the Coming Lord Mayor,
And he cometh from where
Flow the Clyde, and the Spey, and the Usk;

To a tune on the gong,
In praise of brave ALDERMAN LUsk.
He says he’s “thick-skinned,”
But he shall not be pinned
To a word that’s as rough as a husk.
He means he don't mind
Any joke, free and kind,
So here's one for ALDERMAN LUsk.
If he asks us to dine,
We will eat and will wine,
Till there's pressure on waistcoat and busk;
And My Lord's Loving Cup
Punch and Dame will suck up,
To the health of his Lordship, bold łºsk.
We'll come dressed very swell,
And emitting a smell
Of patchouli, otto, and musk;
Or less old-fashioned scent
On our wipes will be sprent
For curbanquet with excellent LUsk.
But his life’s not all glee;
He must sit, don't you see
From ten in the morning till dusk,
And serve justice out, hot,
To knave, blockhead, and sot:
No sinecure, eh, jolly LUsk P
He'll detect lies and crams.
Into bubbles and shams
He'll run, let us hope, a keen tusk;
And swindlers, who ge
For a “Limited Co.”
He'll limit to Quod, the stern LUsk.

TRAGI-COMIC INTELLIGENCE.

behind him a scrap of paper whereon were traced th

The newspaper paragraph which contains the foregoin

of death is of course an event more or less tragical; bu
to render that epithet peculiarly apposite in any part
cular case, that case ought, one thinks, to be a case i
which any peculiarity savouring of antithesis to traged
is not very conspicuous. Broken English, interlarde
with French, produces an effect which can hardly, i
any circumstances, be regarded as other than comical.

[October 11, 1873.
ANTAGONISM IN EXCELSIS.
To the Editor of the Times.
ow SIR'ſ
IN a leading article,
the other day, you were
good enough to say, “The
whole nature of a woman,
at least of ninety-nine
women out of a hundred,
is antagonistic.”
Having informed my
husband—not, of course,
that I am obliged to give
him an account of what
letters I send—that I
should address a remon-
º strance to the papers on
this subject, he told me
, that I ought to write to
the paper in which the
observation appeared. ... I
shall do nothing of the
kind. I believe that—
slave as a woman is—I
am at least free to select
my organ of publication.
I choose to write to
Punch, and I do.
The statement in your
article is perfectly un-
true. The whole nature
of a woman is to be abso-
lutely, if not, abjectly,
submissive. When I am
not interfered with, no
person can be more con-
ciliating; that is to say, if I am allowed my own way, because it is
right that Ishould have it. If I am meanly agreed with only because
I belong to what is called the weaker sex, or to keep me quiet,
things are different. I scorn to be treated like a child, and I
refuse to have my own way, if it is to be given mefor any other reason
than because it is my right. - -
“Antagonistic,” indeed! The word sounds .* but it
means that a woman does not choose to be put upon... I hope that
she never will choose. Even the Marriage Service, written by men
for men (I am sure they thought little enough of women) declares
that a woman is to be i. Isit honouring her to trample her
under your feet, to laugh at her, arguments, and to refuse compli-
ance with her wishes? Yes, I dare say that some men are base
enough to say that it is. But no such insult is permitted in the
house in which I am the head.
Mrs. KING's nonsense about servants, being ill-treated, and her
proposal that they should have more liberty, and be relieved by
relays, is such utter idiotey that I have no patience—and yet I am
a patient person—to argue against it. Iikely that I would give my
orders to some JANE in the morning, and find that she had conveyed
them to some SARAH in the afternoon, that JANE might go trapesing
out with CoRPoRAL Sponge, of the Artillery, and that SARAH might
excuse her blunders by saying—which of course would be a false-
hood—that she had not understood what I wished! As to servants
being ill-treated, they are treated a great deal too well, and there
ought to be a separate police-magistrate—a female one would be the
best—who should hear the complaints of mistresses, and have power
to ishidle, impertinent, or overdressed menials Fº
ut that is only a part of the ridiculous stuff talked at the pre-
cious Social Congress. (Socialism, by the way, was no word for a
lady or gentleman to use when I was younger; not that I am old.)
It is proposed that families should live in common—very common-
and that one staff of servants should attend to a whole group of
employers. That is, a married woman is to give up her establish-
ment, and live in an hotel, which would be sure to be a bad one,
because nobody would have command. My husband has his faults,
many, and he knows them, or if he does not, it is not because I have
failed in my duty to point them out to him, but I will do him the
justice to say that he would never dare to make such a proposal to
me...I married into a house which is not what he could have afforded
to give me, and which is one he should have had too much pride to
live in so long, but still it is my own house. ... If I thought he could
for a moment meditate such a plan as MRs. KING's, the proposition
for a change should not have to come from him, but the change
would be of a very different kind. I should demand a separate
income, and should retire to the society of my dear mother, whose
weaknesses and absurdities I should overlook in consideration
of our relationship, and of her affording me an asylum from tyranny.
Whether women, that is, ladies, could live together in the way
roposed, is not worth arguing, because no lady would listen to the
idea. But if such an arrangement were possible—which it is not—
it is certainly not to the “antagonistic” nature of women that the
certain failure should be laid. It is probable that we should have
our differences, and I, for one, should not conceal my opinions, if I
thought that there was any disposition to meanness in housekeeping;
if the hours of meals were ill regulated; if children (Ido not happen
to have any) were permitted too much prominence in the establish-
ment; if#P. to whom I objected were introduced as visitors, or
guests; if offensive remarks were made on any friends of my own,
or upon my , amusements, or reading. resent the
#. tual encouragement of young men in order to secure them as
ds for any girls in the place, and flirtations would not escape
my censure, whether they were carried on by single or by married
persons. should decline to sanction any political discussions,
unless in the tone of good society, and I should entirely refuse to
countenance any theological conversation that opposed itself to the
teachings of the Church Catechism. I should not expectany gentle-
man to take the licence which I deny to my iº. and to pollute
the atmosphere with smoke. I should emphatically protest against
any festivities, or increased hospitalities on the Sabbath. If I
thought that otherladies were indulging in extravagance in costume,
or in frivolity, as a Christian woman Ishould feelitmy privilege to
warn them against sinful error. Other matters on which I might
think it right to assert my own judgment might arise, and if they
did, I certainly should assert it. But I deny that I should be
“antagonistic,” and I protest against your launching a word which
will become a cant phrase with the thoughtless and the worldly.
Wishing you a betterframe of mind, I am, Sir,
- Yours sincerely,
Clapham. PRISCILLA BoADICEA BROWNRIGG.
P.S.—To attack women without offering them an opportunity of
answering is cowardly; that is, manly.
THE JOLLY PLLGRIMS.
A CoMMITTEE has been established in France for the organisation
of Pilgrimages. Of these excursions it has promoted two regular
old orthodox ones this year; Pilgrimages to the Holy Land. Under
its i. the cost of ºf; and of food and drink in Palestine,
is regulated for the pilgrims. e newspaper para h containing
the particulars above referred to, omits to state §: or no the
Pilgrimage Committee makes any provision of proper reporters for
those expeditions. No miracles have been reported to have occurred
on any of the late occasions when pilgrims have congregated at
Paray-le-Monial and La Salette. None probably did occur for any
reporters, provided for the p se of reporting them, to report.
That may have been owing to the presence of other reporters, the
Special Correspondents of British Protestant journals. These incre-
dulous gentlemen may possibly have, by their mere attendance,
prevented miracles, as sceptics present are said to prevent spiri
manifestations at a séance. But, touching-spirits; by the fore-
thought of a truly considerate Committee:–
“Pilgrims are recommended to carry arms, and to take a good flask of
brandy to mix with water.”
This adjunction of spiritual fortification to the arms of the fleshis
most judiciously prescribed; whatever heretical Teetotallers and
Good ºl. may please to think. It seems quite to accord with

ancient pilgrims were of the same kidney. . depicts the

Sir (ºluim ſambsttr.
Born 1802. DIED October 1, 1878.
MoURN, all dumb things, for whom his skill found voice,
Knitting 'twixt them and us undreamt-of ties,
Till men could in their voiceless joy rejoice,
And read the sorrow in their silent eyes.
O. Sºyºgiºn Power, for whom, like other Kings,
Old life's surcease joins hands with new life's start,
Till, with the Herald, staff in graye that flings,
We cry “Queen Art is dead—Long live Queen Art!”
Her rule, that once reached heaven, from that high sphere
Hadfallen down and down: the rainbow wings
That bore her once where angels carol clear,
Grew clogged and foul with stain of earthly things.
But, hurled from heaven, her earthly empel
Reached far and wide, from where the still lagune
Mirrors the lovely City of the Sea,
By light of golden sun or silver moon :
To where fair Florence, in her crown of towers,
Smiles, with the beauty of a royal bride;
Or where Queen Rome displays great MICHAEL's powers,
Worthy of Roman fame and Papal pride;
Or where, through level of the Lombard lº.
The guided streams spread fatness, and, from far,
White cities, girt with seas of greening grain,
Gleam o'er the mounds that the great river bar;
Or where the blink of the Low Country sun
Against the marsh-mist scarcely holds its own:
And boors make revel among smoke-wreaths dun,
And slow canals skirt polders osier-grown.
Alike in lands where all was fair and bright,
And lands where all was dim and dull of show,
Queen Art found realms to own her sovereign might,
Subjects their tribute at her feet to throw,
Till even upon this, our little isle,
That looms so large in light of various fames,
The Fair Queen deigned at last, though late, to smile,
And dubbed her Knights—a few, but glorious names.
Hogarth and REYNoLDs, GAINSBoRough, and those
Less, and less only, than those peerless three,
Who with them caught our manners as they rose,
And their time mirrored for all times to be ;
And WILKIE, who, to Dutch Art's faithful truth
Added a gentler grace, in purer themes;
And TURNER, who made poet's fancy sooth,
And coupled widest truth with wildest dreams;
And, last not least, him, whose death we deplore;
A name writ large upon Art's lieger-roll,
As any of the mightiest gone before—
Who, first of painters, gave dumb things a soul—
And made men feel the links that hold men bound
In love and § and grief with those dumb things,
Till hidden depths of sympathy were found,
Where human kindness flowed from secret springs.
He sought the shieling of the shepherd dead,
Beside whose bier nor man nor woman weeps;
Only the colly lays his faithful head
pon the coffin, where his master sleeps.
Up, with St. Bernard's searchers of the snow,
he good monks' good dogs, in the drifts was he ;
Or, where the wild white horses, foaming, go,
With brave Newfoundland saving life from sea.
Or where the lordly blood-hound, with pricked ear
And scent suspicious, watches for his lord,
At the locked door, from whose sill, trickling clear,
The blood bespeaks surprise and treacherous sword.
The lesson teaching still of love and trust,
In dogs' true service that pleads strong, though mute:
Or with bright humour piercing the thin crust
That hides the common germs in man and brute:
Showing us Jack in Office, proud of place,
Or full-wigged Sapience, laying down the law;
Or High Life's dainty and disdainful face,
Or Low Life, big of jowl, and broad of jaw:
Or sending through the townsman's stagnant vein
The "...º. unbreathed of men,
Where from the ling the moorcock whirs amain,
Startling the antlered monarch of the glen.
Or where by mountain tarn, when evening's light
Lies limpid on the edges of the hill,
The hunted red-deer, panting from his flight,
Seeks sanctuary, serene and safe and still;
Or where o'er the untrodden waste of snow,
Great stag's great shadow on the moonlight falls,
As neath star-studded skies with frost aglow,
Rival on rival, shrill, in challenge calls.
How many a weary paeer of the street,
In City pent, has paused these seenes to scan,
And drunk the heather's fragrance round his feet,
In draughts wherewith wild Nature strengthens man!
His Art has been sound teacher to his a
Whether of sympathy 'twixt man and brute, **
Or lessons drawn from Nature's wholesome page,
And pleasure that, in truth, has deepest root.
Few have lived happier, busier lives than he,
whose Art, plied with delight, delight still gave,
And if at last a cloud fello'er his glee,
It hung not long between him and the grave.
Our best known name in Art has passed away;
Of gifts, though bounded, truest, most his own;
Who did such work as, none of earlier day,
And shall by that to latest days be known.
And as the artist wrought, so lived the man:
umorous, joyous, genial of mood,
With love that took all live things in its span,
And, without effort, all things to it wooed.
Whatever growth of Art may grace our time,
His still shall hold its place—apart—alone;
Others as hiº by other roads may climb,
None can be widelier loved, or worthier known.
A MODUS WIWENDI.
By accounts from Germany; it appears that the German Ultra-
montane organs have published an “identical manifesto,” addressed
|by political leaders of the papistical faction to Roman Catholics,
'exhorting them to make, by their votes at the next election, “a firm
stand against the despotic majority.” Moreover:-
“It points out that of the immense sums of money obtained by the war, and
by the increasing revenue derived from growing prosperity, notathaler has
been applied to lighten taxation or for peaceable outlay, but all has been
.. by the army, the fortresses, and kindred objects. The Ultramon-
tane leaders proclaim their motto to be, “Truth, Justice, and Liberty,’”
Ay, Truth, Justice, and Liberty; but the greatest of these,
PRINCE BIsMARCK will probably be apt to suspect, is Liberty
according to the Ultramontane idea of that blessing; the liberty º
Bishops to rule their flocks independently of the laws of the German
Empire, and subject to the dictation of the Roman See. Spain
enjoyed Ultramontane liberty, for example, when the Spanish
priesthood could hand over heretics to the secular arm, and so forth,
not to specify, in bad, taste, historical facts vulgarly known.
Liberty of this kind includes Truth and justice; it is, we know,
liberty to enforce the truth by just means. The liberty of blowing
the war-trumpet, so as to stir up a crusade against the Kingdom of
Italy is perhaps a particular of liberty in general as understood º
Ultramontanes; but if they want to have taxation lightened, an
money laid out peaceably, they should desist from taking this
...; and, on the contrary, beseech the Pop E to try and make an
amicable arrangement with his “Sub-Alpine King.”
Honour ABLE MENTION.
SHEFFIELD may, with good reason, *; to itself somewell-
known, words of the Poet Laureate's, in his Locksley Hall, and
boast that certain steel instruments, for the manufacture of which
that town is famous, are “foremost in the files of time.”

STIFFENING PRICES.
AMong the news over which we are accustomed to break our fast,
the subjoined truly cheering announcement appeared the other
morning:—
“The PRICE of CoAL.—An advance of 3s. 4d. on all descriptions of house
coal supplied in the Manchester district will take place to-morrow, furnace
engine coal and slack being at the same time advanced 1s. 8d. per ton. Prices
are also stiffening in the Wigan and West Leigh districts.”
The cry is still they rise. Coals, not being raised in due º:
rise in price. They rise, daily, higher and higher. As yet it is on
the coals that rise. Coals keeprising; and temperature is about to fall.
There is every prospect that the fall of temperature will correspond
in ratio to the rise of coals. As mercury descends in the thermo-
meter we may expect that coals will ascend in the market. Thus
whilst prices go on stiffening, is it not to be feared that limbs and
bodies, frozen for want of a fire, will stiffen too? But what is that
to the coal-owners and the colliers? A consideration which, of
course, will very much enhance the jollity the former will congratu-
late themselves on their enormous gains withal, and the latter will
quaff their º and gorge themselves with meat four times
a day. How can they be expected to sympathise with their flesh
and {i,j stiffened by the ever stiffening prices of coals, the result
of enlightened and beneficent legislation, which has emancipated
workmen from all restraint that ever withheld them from dictating
their own terms without regard to the consequences, affecting other
people only, of their avarice, luxury, and laziness? Of course,
enlightened and beneficent legislation can never be reconsidered.
The operation of the natural laws regulating supply and demand
must on no account be permitted to be interfered with in this land
of Free Trade, except by the Trades' Unions; but perhaps some-
thing could be done by Government, to check, the unreasoning
impatience too likely to actuate unintelligent multitudes stiffening
in the depth of winter under a coal-famine, to which they do not
properly resign themselves as a visitation from their fellow-man.
In the good old times, when bread rose to a starvation price, there
were sometimes other risings. Would it not be prudent to take,
betimes, measures of a precautionary nature, in view of possible
effects of combination among our honest, hard-handed colliers,
similar to those which used to be excited by the greedy Protectionism
of a bloated aristocratic landed nobility and gentry?
“MOST MUSICAL, MOST MELANCHOLY.”
MR. PUNCH's susceptibilities are exquisite, and he has seldom had
them awakened more sweetly than by a theatrical advertisement
which appears daily, and runs thus:—
CH*Nº CROSS. W. H. C. NATION'S Love Songs. To charm
the sensitive and the tender-hearted.
“Sensitive and tender-hearted l’’ Words which exactly explain
Mr. Punch's gentle nature. He lives but for music, for that of
which MR. THoMAS MooRE so beautifully says, in Lalla Rookh–
“And music, too, dear music, that can touch,
Above all else, man-milliners and such.”
At an early period he means to go and be charmed. Meantime he
hears that the burlesque into which the “Love Songs” are fitted, is
very clever, and he always rejoices in the success of anything
stamped with the name of A'BECKETT.
Bespect for Court.
CoNTEMPT of Court has in many cases lately been visited with
very heavy penalties. Let us not incur the like by pointing out
that the justice of punishment without reward is one-sided. It
may, however, be permitted to ; that some acknowledgment
is due to a Respect for Court which been continuous, consistent,
and profound. The more substantial the recognition the better.

CATCHING A TARTAR.
H! if all Britons were
Grahameses bri-
gands would do well
to give them a wide
berth. Well may
the Correspondent
who forwards the
account of the en-
counter of this preur
chevalier with bri-
ds at Denia, near
aleneia, describe
considerable nerve,
great presence of
mind, and
resource.” This we
call very mild lan-
guage indeed, after
reading MR. GRA-
HAME's deposition
before the Justice of
the Peace, how he
was riding home the
other evening in his
tartana (a -
en
one-horseshay W.
- - - denly stopped }. a.
band of “six, eight, or more,” brigands armed with guns—four
on the right of him, two on the left of him, to say nothing of a
dagger in the rear—in reply to whose summons ¥. GRAHAME
promptly let fly four shots from his revolver, right and left, and,
under their cover, leapt out, and ran for his life. A gun, loaded with
buck shot, was fired at him, hit him in the thigh, and brought him
down. Leaping up again, he drew the fire of “from twelve to six-
teen barrels,” whose bullets whizzed round his head and body. By
this time some of the villains—worse luck for them!—had come up
to him. The indomitable Briton, threw himself on one of them,
wrenched his f". from him, knocked him to the ground with the
butt-end, and followed up this by flooring two more in the same
fashion. One only was left: the ruffian aimed at him, but GRAHAME
Was i. to the emergency, and reversing the gun, with which he
had already floored the three, he let fly at the fourth, who at the
same moment let fly at him. Our hero saw no more of this worthy—
no doubt he was the owner of the dead body afterwards picked up.
“Some of the other ruffians now coming forward,” the indomitable
Briton began, with both hands, to throw stones at them from a heap,
“fortunately beside him on the road.” Stones in the hands of
GRAHAME may well have seemed to these ruſſians, after their expe-
rience, more formidable than the bullets in their own s, for the
deponent adds, with charming naïveté, “When I had beaten them
off, Iran in the direction of Denia, calling for help at the top of
my voice.” The top of his voice could not have been very high, one
would fancy, after his previous exercise; nor can we be rised to
read of his soon after “lying down, faint from loss of blood, among
the vines,” and hearing the tartana driven off at full speed.
There is a smack of Falstaff’s exploit at Gad's-hill about this
story, which makes one very glad to read, at the end of it, that'very
substantial and ghastly pieces de conviction were forthcoming in
proof of the tale:-
“As soon as the news was conveyed to Denia, the authorities proceeded at
once to the spot, where they found a man disguised and masked, quite dead,
a loosejacket, and a good deal of blood. The §. and tartana were found
near Ondara, three miles distant from Denia, the pony covered with wounds
inflicted with a knife or dagger to make the poor animal go its fastest, and
the cushions of the tartana saturated with the §. of the wounded brigands.”
If this fall into the hands of MR. GRAHAME, or his friends, don't
let them be angry with Punch for a doubt only suggested by the
tremendous prowess of this British Paladin. The story reads too
good to be true in these milk-and-water days. Punch can remember
nothing like it, out of the more audacious than veracious chronicles
of poor CHARLEs LEVER or CAPTAIN MAYNE REID.
he next time we hear of an express train ...”. by a
handfull of, Aragonese freebooters, or an Australian mail-cart
“bailed-up” by a leash of bushrangers, let us remember GRAHAME
and his single-handed encounter with the Valencian brigand band
‘...of six, or eight, or more”—and with no further remembrance of
Falstaff's men in buckram, than may prompt the hope that GRA:
HAME's arithmetic may be as safely relied upon as his revolver, and
that he has not seen—however he may have killed—double, in this
most heroic of all recorded engagements with rascals at long odds.

SOCIAL SCIENCE.
THE Social Science Association has been holding its Annual Con-
gress at Norwich. The Members, both ladies and gentlemen, talked
on a great many subjects, but the programme was not so complete
as it might have been. Want of time alone can have been the
reason why an odd half-hour or two was not given up to the dis-
cussion of some of the following important questions:–
Is it desirable to make any change in the rules which at present
govern the precedence of guests at dinner-parties? Difficulties
eye *... as, for example, when the wives of the chief
Banker, the principal Brewer, the leading Solicitor, and the Doctor
in the best practice, in a country town, have all to be taken down
from the drawing-room to the dining-room; or when the Senior
Curate of the parish church, the Incumbent of the chapel of ease,
the Master of * Grammar School, a Fellow of St. Michael's Oxford,
and a Fellow of St. Martin's Cambridge, meet together at the same
y.
How far is it allowable to depart from strict veracity, when you
are expected to congratulate a friend on a marriage engagement
which you have every reason to believe is about the worst he (or
she) could have contracted; or to . a candid opinion of a book
presented to you by a sensitive and fiery young author, which you
are certain will bring him neither fame nor fortune; or to say what
you really think about a little Cousin in long clothes, when ‘‘it” is
suddenly introduced to you by a partial mother and a prejudiced
nurse?
Agriculture—
There are Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of
why should there not be also established Chambers of Fashion ?
sed of women of influence, position, taste, and good sense,
selected from all ranks of society, and assisted by some eminent
milliners and dressmakers, sitting as assessors and advisers, but not
allowed to vote, such tribunals, meeting twice a year, in the
Spring and Autumn, to determine the shapes, colours, and mate-
rials of the bonnets, hats, dresses, and outdoor garments to be worn
in the ensuing Summer and Winter, and the style in which the hair
should be arranged, would exercise a most beneficial influence over
modern costume. They might issue a code of instructions—signed
by the DUCHEss of DARLINGTON as Chairwoman of the Chamber–
framed to prevent those outrageous mistakes which, under the pre-
sent system of unrestrained freedom, are committed every day and
everywhere—colours not matching with colours, colours in violent
contrast with complexions, the stout adopting fashions only designed
for the 'slim, the short figuring in raiment expressly intended for
the tall, and the old and the young, the clumsy and the graceful,
the plain and the beautiful, wearing exactly the same apparel.
Are the wedding ceremonies and customs now prevailing in Great
Britain and her Colonies capable of improvement? j a limit
be assigned to the number of officiating bridesmaids and clergymen?
Would it be feasible to establish some plan of barter, whereby
young brides might be enabled to exchange their duplicate wedding
presents? What are the comparative advantages of long and short
engagements; and what proportion ought the gifts, ºšy made by
the gentleman to the lady during the period of preliminary proba-
tion, to bear to his income?
Is a mistress justified in interfering with her servant's dress, and
are lace, falls, feathers, polonaises, and jewellery, compatible with
the emoluments and position of maids of all work? º: it be
possible to adopt one uniform hour throughout the United Kingdom
at which servants should be expected to be “in” on Sunday even-
ing? How are the prejudices of the Kitchen against the use of
Australian provisions to be overcome?
This is an ingenious age. England has produced some of the
greatest inventions of modern times. Englishmen have made some
of the most remarkable discoveries which history records. But
there seem to be limits to the ingenuity of our countrymen and
countrywomen. Perhaps the offer of a handsome premium on the
part of the Social Science Association, coupled with the exclusive

THERE is no subject which the most thoughtful of mankind can
discuss more seriously than women are accustomed to talk and write
about dress. Their conversation, relative to that important parti-
cular is more º grave than any that men ever hold touching
money matters and business. Any jocular observation which may
in the course of it be ventured upon by a masculine interlocutor is
resented by a blank look and a pause of silence. It is received as a
pun is when made by a buffoon interrupting a Professor's argument
on theology. The commencement of “Fashions for October,” in
Le Follet, with a joke, is a novelty strange indeed; and therefore
as a stranger give it welcome. Listen:—
“Our September days thisłł." have, many of them, brought the coming

its teetotal proclivities, has been for some weeks past afflicted with
a shivering fit whenever it has happened to pass a public-house.
Investigation being made as to the cause of the complaint, it was
discovered that the animal happened to be present when its gallant

CLAIMS ON A CLAIMANT.
THE “White Terror” may be something more than a Bogy. Yet
the Count DE CHAMBORD's late manifesto, in the form of a private
letter, published in a newspaper, contains a passage of which some
critics have perhaps unduly questioned the sincerity. Amon
“things so little serious” that “they cannot be seriously answered
which many people apprehended from a Legitimist restoration, he
mentions “a war madly undertaken under, impossible conditions.”
These words have been suspected to . that if conditions, impos-
sible at present, by-and-by became possible, and HENRI THE FIFTH
were king, the war would be undertaken; France, that is, would go to
war with Italy for an Ultramontane idea. But, without giving the
Claimant of the Throne of France credit for honour superior to equi-
vocation, which he may be supposed to have practised under priestly
influence, it is quite possible to believe that }. would think not only
twice and thrice, but a good many times, before adventuring to
lunge into a crusade for the restoration of the temporal Popedom.

tion to the Holy See, but also a most forgiving disposition, would
surely be requisite to induce the descendant of St. Louis to go to the
i. of embarking in a perilous warlike enterprise in order to
heap coals of fire on the head of the successor of St. Peter.
Besides, as to the release of the once Sovereign Pontiff from tem-
poral sovereignty, º a legitimate Eldest Son of the Church
might feel bound to say that the thing fieri non debuit, yet, never-
theless, would he not have very sufficient reason to think that

culties with their Holy Father, even whilst Holy Father and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION. M.R. DISRAELI. PUNCH.
EPARTING from his habitual rule of never intruding
his own name, his own portrait, or his own affairs
into these pages, Mr. Punch feels it due to a
distinguished statesman, wit, and humorist, we, alludes of course,
to the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition, to set him right with the
British Public. Everybody has read, and LoRD GREY DE, WILTQN
has read aloud, a capital letter in which MR. DISRAELI dashingly
denounces the character and conduct of the Ministry. The Right
Hon. Gentleman wrote:–
“For nearly five years the present Ministers have harassed every trade,
worried every profession, and assailed or menaced every class institution and
species of property in the country. Occasionally they have varied this state
of civil warfare by perpetrating some job which has outraged public opinion,
or by stumbling into mistakes which have been always discreditable and
sometimes ruinous. All this they call a policy, and seem quite proud of it;
but the country has, I think, e up its mind to close this career of plun-
dering and blundering.”
Nothing could be much smarter, and the letter lost the Bath election
for the Conservatives. But, as must be clear upon a second perusal
of the epistle, it was not intended for Bath, or for LORD GREY DE
WILTON at all. Our friend MR. DISRAELI, who knows that any-
thing he can write Mr. Punch will gladly publish, meant the letter
for US. It was designed as a squib, and not as a serious address to
a constituency. By what accident, or mistake by an able but over-
worked Secretary, the letter was sent to LoBD GREY DE.WILTON,
instead of to Mr. Punch, we are not yet quite clear, but we cannot,
on that account, delay making this explanation. No person ought
to have supposed the leader of a great and powerful party capable
of practising an elaborate joke even upon the Fogies of Bath, but
that they were deceived is shown by their having resented the
epistle, as unworthy of a political leader, and having absented them-
selves from the poll, thus º CAPTAIN HAYTER. Our Liberal
satisfaction at this result is much impaired by our vexation that an
intended kindness to ourselves should have been the means of
annoying our friend. That he is annoyed will be clear from the
following note, which duly reached its destination,-
DEAR PUNCH,
INTo the pigs of KING BLApud there entered the First Whig, and
the herd has run violently into the sea. Or rather, their normal obstimacy
has developed into unmasterly inaction. Forsyth, forsooth, must be made
the sacrifice to their ineptitude, and inability to pple with a second
idea. This were irritating, if philosophers like ourselves ever tolerated self-
irritation. I wrote to you in a #. and the profound wisdom of the Oriental
mind is shown in the proverb, agitel lil Shaitan, which perhaps GLADstone
does not understand—tell him it means that “hurry is the Devil's.” Bath
is gone, and so no more of Bath. Should I have to redistribute the repre-
sentation, it shall not be my fault if so stupid a population be long afflicted
with electoral cares and responsibilities. Explain their foolishness, forget
mine, and believeme, Always yours,
B. DISRAELI.
Mr. Punch willingly complies with his esteemed contributor's
wish, and there is an end, except that while on the subject he con-
gratulates the veteran SIR WILLIAM HAYTER, the accomplished
ex-whip, whose bland yet anxious look is stillº to Mr. Punch's
eyes, upon the return of his gallant son. DISRAELI—politics
aside—is not displeased at this good fortune happening to the now
venerable enemy who has so often cheered the Wº. to the fray,
and not always to victory.
THE ROGUE'S RULE REVERSED.
HoNEST people will be glad to learn that the rogue's maxim,
caveat emptor, endorsed by Statesmen, and other doctors or disciples
of the shoddy-school, has, as a justification for cheating customers
through a fraudulent advertisement, been disallowed by at least one
upright Magistrate, MR. BARKER, at the Clerkenwell Police Court.
On Tuesday last week the Manager of a Coal Company was pulled
up before that tribunal by a MR. HENRY BARTLETT, c with
“having sold one sort of coals for and as a sort which they really
were not.” MR. BARTLETT had bought a ton and a half of the coals
advertised in a puff, which he believed to be true. But in
catching the complainant by their advertisement, the advertisers
caught a Tartar. T_MR. BARTLETT is a consulting analyst; up to
analysing coals. His servant found that it took her one hour to get
the cheap coals he had bought to burn; and analysis H. them
to be very deficient in combustible matter. These facts having been
deposed to—
“The Magistrate said he considered the case fully proved. He ordered the
defendant to pay a fine of £10 and costs.”
At another police-court, a short time ago, cheating in coals by
means of a lying advertisement, went unpunished, by a decision
doubtless determined by the maxim caveat emptor. The judgment
of MR. BARRER in a similar case evinces, on the contrary, a leaning
to the side of honest good faith: indeed altogether to honesty rather
than fraudulence, and, in the interests of the former side, it is to be
hoped that all persons in authority, or whose words carry weight
with them, will do and say all they possibly can to discountenance
the rascal's maxim, caveat emptor, and to the disco ment of
scoundrels in general, and dishonest tradesmen of the shoddy-school
in particular, endeavour, with all their ability and influence, to
enforce the contrary rule, caceat renditor.
PATERNAL POLICE.
FourTEEN naughty grown persons were charged the other day, at
Bow Street, with being in Evans's Supper Rooms after prohibited
hours. The Commissioners of Police are so indulgent as to allow
the Public to enter the hotel for refreshments up to half-past
twelve, and they may remain taking them there as long as one
o'clock, when it is time that everybody, as well as little boys and
girls, should be in bed and asleep, the defendants' lawyers pleaded,
on behalf of their naughty ºt; clients, that the notices warning
visitors were not posted so that they could be well enough seen.
Mi WAUGHAN, the Magistrate, so far admitted this excuse that he
Salol :-
“It would be much better in future to have notices placed in different parts
of the hall. It seemed to him a hard thing that visitors should alone be sum-
moned, as they remained in the place under the protection of the landlord.
They were not in the building a very long time after the prohibited hours,
and although the law had been broken, still he did not think that the defend-
ants should be called upon to paymore than 2s. each, the cost of the summons.”
MR. WAUGHAN is not strict enough; is he, Papa, to carry out a
Papa's Act of Parliament? And fia did not himself make the
Act as strict as he should have done—did he No; the law ought
to be that if naughty people disobeyit, and stay sitting up at .
in a tavern later than the Commissioners of Police *. to let them,
they should not merely be fined a little money the next morning,
§ taken up at once, and taken home, and well popped and put to
When Papa was young, Britons, as people called themselves,
would have laughed the idea of letting the Police limit their supper-
hours to scorn; but they were fierce unruly Britons, and not nice,
and meek, and mild, and patient, like ourselves, their descendants,
were they, Papa?
A Projected Improvement.
THE present system of encores at Concerts, Oratorios, &c., has
long been condemned as most objectionable. Those who are opposed
to it will be interested to hear of a proposal, that in future all the
encored pieces should be given together at the close of the enter-
tainment.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ORTHODOX TEMPERANCE.
ATH, this year, has
seen a Church Con-
gress distinguished
by the uncommon
occurrence of a dis-
cussion in a clerical
assembly mainly
conducted withgood
sense. The subject
thus rarely treated
was that of “The
Duty of the Church
in regard to the
Temperance Move-
ment,” the argu-
ment of most of the
eakers being, that
the duty of the
Church mainly was
to aid the temper-
ance movement by
preaching modera-
tion, and by setting
alFºl example
of it. This example
some of them had
carried to the ex-
tent of voluntary
total abstinence;
but moderation was the rule they were content with recommending
as sufficient to be inculcated on other people. The REV, ERSKINE
CLARKE, for fifteen years a “stanch thorough ºf. ” abstainer
“from wine,” and doubtless also from other exhilarating fluids,
including punch—notwithstanding the plea for that º: ad-
vanced by the Ordinary of Newgate in Jonathan Wild—after having
forcibly dwelton the evils of excess in the use of those good familiar
creatures, observed that:—
“With regard to Good Templars, at the fourth session of the Grand
Lodge at Bristol it was admitted that while 183,982 members were in good
standing, 18,897 had violated their pledge—that was to say, that a number
equal to 10 per cent. of its members in good standing were perjured persons.
In the name of divine compassion and common human kindness they must
all deprecate a system which put such a stumbling-block in the way of souls—
(hear, hear !)—and he thought the duty of the Church in regard to this phase
of the temperance movement seemed to be to warn her members against it.”
The words of the good old song—
“Drink to me only with thine eyes,
And I will pledge with mine”
are brought to mind by the foregoing statement about the Good
Templars—their pledge appears to be entirely ocular.
It was remarked by the reverend gentleman to whom we owe the
foregoing remarks, that “a sort of traditional feeling connected the
clergy in our literature rather with the friends of the bottle than
with its opponents; ” and he cited HogaRTH’s “parson in gown and
bands,” SHAKSPEARE's clergy, “none of them examples of abstinence,”
even “the mild and gentle Čow prºsº chaplain, and “the epithet,
once so familiar, of “two-bottle orthodox,’ which our forefathers
used to bestow on a section of the clergy over-fond of toasting
“Church and King,’” as attesting that view of them. He thought
that “the clergy of our day, as a body, did not deserve the imputa-
tions of past time; ” and undoubtedly they do not. Yet let it
be remembered that the two-bottle orthodox parsons were really
orthodox, and, though their two bottles were bottles of port,
mostly seldom the worse for them, and nearly all at least doc-
trinally sober. That perhaps was because it was port they drank,
and that port was sound, and sound wine engendered sound views.
Then, if any parson dressed himself up in Romanesque pon-
tificals, and pretended to say mass, he would have been supposed to
have considerably exceeded his two bottles; and that of a morning.
In the good old days of two-bottle orthodoxy, a clergyman "...#
have got the credit of having finished at least three bottles if he
had ºd his bishop to let him put up in his church a
baldacchino.
Progress and Enlightenment.
..THE passion for Railway. Pilgrimages is likely to spread. Very
likely it will extend from the Papists to the Mahometans. What
do our friends in the City say to the idea of a Mecca Railway? No
doubt the SULTAN would, for a consideration, readily grant the
necessary concession to any speculators, who would then only need
the ability to enforce it.
THE NATIONS AT THEIR LESSONS IN DAME
EUROPA'S SCHOOL.
THERE's a school, severe and stern, where their lessons nations learn—
Whose prizes and whose poenas are awarded to their earners:
On the pupil-teacher plan that school's worked since it began,
All in it must be teachers, and all in it should be learners:
And though each nation labours for itself more than its neighbours,
'Tis their fault if all don't profit from each pupil in the ...;
And so learn to shun the blunders that bring down the master's
thunders,
The birch-rod on the bungler, the fool's-eap on the fool.
There's that burly boy, John BULL, though of habit rather full,
Too much given to beef and beer, and too keen for pocket-money,
Has a fund of common sense that counts pounds as well as pence,
And more sure, if slow, sagacity, than lads of mood more sunny.
I think that boy's inclined to turn over in his mind
The lessons for his profit, of his fellows short and tall,
Be’t young thirteen to the dozen, SAM SLICK, his Yankee Cousin,
Or that troublesome JACK SPANIARD, as saucy as he's small;
Or that solid German Bursch, whose motto still is “dursch,”
(That's Viennese for “thorough,” and “durch” don't fit my
rhyme),
Who his patient way still plods, makes no rush, but walks down
ociols
As tº: war, book, art, craft, science, flask, pot, pipe, he takes
is time;
His objects still he reaches º and so teaches
The Hare and Tortoise moral in DAME EUROPA's School;
Thanks Kh bottom, brains, and bellows, confounding the sharp
ellows
Who start full speed, then slacken, scorn time, and spurn at rule.
Or that Russ boy, or boy-ar, with caftan and samovar,
What’s in him, what he’s after, who here can see, or say?
He's the dark horse of the school, and far more of knave than fool,
Keeps to himself his little game, till the big game's there to play.
Or that old, old Turkish boy, who, his “kef” so he enjoy,
Lets his quondam fags take with him what liberties they dare,
Swops solid tuck for toffey, and prefers his pipe and coffee,
To learning any lesson, and taking any care.
But who’s this stately lass, who has scarce yet found her class—
So late among the nations has ITALIA come to school—
Whose eyes outshine the fairest, whose form o'erbears the rarest,
Whose brow seems made to wear a crown, her hands a realm to
Tulie
And who’s this that, gaunt and grey, man or woman, who shall

WANDALIA.
“IN Cambridgeshire,” says GIBBoN, quoted by BYRON, “the
Romans planted a great number of Vandals.” The bard adds that
the race was flourishing in his time. But the Wandals of Cambridge-
shire must have been converted, and have exchanged their icono-
clastic tendencies for excessive idolatry. They happen to want a
Parliamentary candidate. They used to return LoRD Royston, but
he is now, *...*. EARL OF HARDWICKE. So they ask the
HoN. ELIOT THoMAs YoRKE, uncle of the Earl, to stand. He won't.
So they ask CAPTAIN York E, brother of the Earl, to stand. He
won't. So they propose to ask the HoNourABLE 'Eiror Constan.
TINE, YoFKE, another brother of the Earl, to stand. It is not
wonderful that somebody thinks the line should be drawn some-
where, and that it is not necessary to ask everybody in the world
who happens to be called Yorke. MR. HICKs, a Cambridgeshire
gentleman, demands why the county is to be made a rotten
borough for the House of Yorke. Truly, “a question to be asked.”
Cambridgeshire, , like º in the play, seems inclined to
say to the Earl (whom we like very much, all the same, as a jolly
Englishman)—
“Our gracious Lord, here in the Parliament,
Let us “insert” the Family of York.”
A Sailor's Home.
In a list of Ministerial Movements—the poor fellows are exhausted
by one or two Cabinet Councils—comes the following:—
“MR. Gösch EN has gone to his residence at Seacox Heath.”
We could have wished for an additional syllable. The appro-
priateness of Seacoxswain Heath, as a retreat for the First Lord of
the Admiralty, would have been apparent to persons of all shades of
opinion.
IDEAL NANCY.
Most readers are familiar with the old English tragi-comic song
whose hero is the Lord Lovel and heroine the Lady Nancy Bell. . It
was not that noble Lord who engaged himself by the following
promise:—
“I shall visit Nancy when, the crisis having been overcome, we shall be
enabled to rejoice in safety and peace at the liberation of the country.”
No; the foregoing words are those of M. THIERs. They occur in
a letter which that distinguished Statesman has addressed to the
Mayor of a French city, which bears the name of the heroine of
the º: lively ballad above referred to. Of late years
especially it has become usual, in painting and sculpture, to repre-
sent cities under female forms supposed to be appropriate. Exe-
cuted by an artist of competent .#. a figure representing Nancy,
on canvas or in marble, might be a really imposing work of Art.
Yet a familiar female diminutive suggests charms and graces which
are less dignified than captivating. We cannot help smiling when-
ever we fancy, whether painted or graven, an image of Nancy.
Welcome to a Lecturer.
“”TIs time we Twain did show ourselves.” 'Twas said
By CAESAR, when one MARK had lost his head: -
By MARK, whose head’s quite bright, 'tis said again;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
Pepresents himself as en royage, and safely returns to his native
Country.
S a useful hint, Sir, to in-
tending Tourists in Brit-
tany, remember that, how-
ever powerful may be the
Silver Key, you must al-
ways have ready a neat set
of compliments wherewith
to oil the locks. >
stick to your traps, for,
as my Step-Grandmother
says, “A Fool and his lug-
gage are soon parted.”
We did all the environs
of Dinan, in a triumphal
chariot. Having come out
- for a drive, we º re-
fused to descend and eke
out the time by walking
to points of view. The
Driver tried very hard to
induce us. With a crack-
ing of whip, a jangling of
bells, and a hullabaloo
enough to have alarmed
even a Breton Yi. on.
a sultry day, he pulled up
his noble steeds at the
border of a grand avenue,
- - about two hundred yards
in length by a hundred in, breadth, and at the end we saw what
appeared to us to resemble a dirty, old, broken, useless, and
unused pump. -
“There it is!” cried the man waying his whip, and * to
| dance himself into an ecstasy of admiration and delight, as he held
the carriage-door open. “There's the fountain There is the
sºng! ..It is magnificent 1 Every one descends here to see the
spring .
: Is that it?'...we asked, pointing to the §.
“Oui-dam. Yes .# , that's it,” said the brave Breton.
But we wouldn't budge. e told him it was nothing, and not
worth taking two steps to see; whereupon he º his shoulders,
his eyes twinkled with humour, and he admitted that we were quité
right; adding that, after all, everything, round about was.#
much like this; and, in fact, he began to depreciate all the ordinary
excursions from Dinan, except one really beautiful route, which he
| would show us. Of course this resulted in his keeping us out double
the time we had bargained for, but it was well worth the money.
In driying through a new country it was, I had hitherto considered,
and so also had my second Step-Grandmother, a great thing to have
with us a Well-informed Friend, who “knew place well, and
had seen most of it before.”
He had utterly forgotten all about it. His explanation was that
the place had been. So altered since his last visit. As, however, all
the most recent guide-books state that in their principal character-
istic features neither the towns nor villages of Brittany have under-
gone any change for the last, six hundred years, this computation
would make my Well-informed Friend a Patriarch of some consider-
able standing, and first cousin, perhaps, to the Wandering Jew.
He made up for this, however, by being highly instructive.
His plan, of imparting information to us as §. along, seemed
to be based upon the same motive as that which induced the simple
soldat in La Grande Duchesse to ask for a schoolmaster's place, “in
order that he might learn .# himself.”
“This,” said my Well-informed Friend, as we drove along the
road 'twixt Dinan and Dol, “is an interesting country. Let me see,
this was the great place for the Vendéens.”
... The who?” asked my Grandmother.
“The Vendéens,” replied my Well-informed Friend, adding im-
º as he turned to me, “wasn't it?” as if he still had his
doubts of his own historical accuracy.
I asked him, “ Why were the Wendéens so called?”
“Well, let me see,” he observed, meditatively, “they were in the
Revolution,”—this is always a safe thing to say of any Frenchmen
| +" and were a sort of sharpshooters, eh, weren't they?” I return
that I am depending upon him for information.
“Well,” he answered, with, probably, an inward resolve to look
up the whole subject the instant he hould get home among his
books, “the Wendéens were like the franc-tireurs, and their name
was something to do with-I fancy, I don't say I am absolutely
...} endetta; and they took a vow of eternal vengeance,
and so on.
“But,” I remarked, “the Wendetta was Corsican.”
“Exactly,” returned my Well-informed Friend; “why not?
NAPOLEoN was a Corsican, wasn't he?”
This was, evidently, decisive, and as I had nothing to say for or
§ it, we set ourselves to admire the vast panorama of the
thickly-wooded “º. which we seemed to be hedged in on
every side. , My Well-informed Friend improved the occasion by
giving us a few statistics on apple-growing. The statistics were, on
examination, limited to the information that Devonshire and Corn-
wall were great º counties, that Brittany resembled both these,
in having plenty of orchards, and that he himself invariably took
cider-cup at his Club in summer, which of course went far to
encourage ºff." trade in England and France,
My Well-informed Friend was immense on architecture. When
we visited a cathedral or any ancient church, my Step-Grandmother
º: that we might have a verger, or some one who knew all
about it.
“I can tell you all about it,” said my Well-informed Friend,
qualifying this assertion immediately afterwards by adding, “That
is, quite as much as you'll want to know.”
y Grandmother yielded at first, and so did I. When we were
quit of my Well-informed Friend, we delivered ourselves over to
#. guides, and the amount of remarkable things which we
ad allowed to escape our notice, owing to our reliance upon our
friend's information, would have formed quite a valuable catalogue.
“That’s Saxon,” he used to say, pointing to a plain archway, “ and
that's Norman,” pointing to another uncommonly like the first.
“That's pointed Gothic, and that the floriated Gothie, all different
styles at different periods. Here!” he would continue, moving us
on rapidly, so as to avoid giving us a minute to think over details,
“is a lovely Rose Window; and observe in those side-lights how the
old glass has been preserved.”
With this he has begun and finished any and every Cathedral.
If he can get to some part of the building, and decipher a Latin in-
scription before our arrival, he will tell us that “here was buried
old, Gozla N DE, PoſNg; we ought to find his tomb somewhere about
with an effigy.” Then he used to pretend to be searching for it.
Presently he would announce, jo y, that his labours had been
j. “Here it is lº' he would exclaim, pointing to a broken-
nosed warrior, doing his best to seem at his ease in the most uncom-
fortable armour. “Here's SIR GoziaN. , Look! He was three
times at the Crusades, you see; that you know by his having his
legs crossed three times,” and so on. -
‘What,” asked my Grandmother, “is the date of Norman archi-
tecture ?—and is Gothic later P’’ -
“Well, º: my Well-informed Friend, considering the
matter, “the Norman was first, of course; ” he evidently had his
doubts on the subject, and was making another mental Mem.—to
look it, up directly he got home. “The Norman,” he continued,
“was first, and the Gothic improved on it.”
“But,” said my Grandmother, who is wonderful for her years
“if the Goths were such barbarians—as they were, or why s ould
everyone with bad taste be called a Goth or a Wandal?—how is it
they built such beautiful hurghes: "... - -
“Ah!” replied my Well-informed Friend, with a sort of sigh, and
a shrug that seemed to intimate how, at last, my worthy relative had
formulated in so many words the difficulty of lifetime. “Ah!
that’s it! How did the Egyptians build the Pyramids? How did
the Druids pile up Stonehenge?...We don't know.” -
The list of things that my Well-informed Friend, will have to
“look up’’ when he “gets back among his books,” must have
amounted to a considerable number by the time he º us at
Mont St. Michel, where; on seeing a pilgrimage, observed,
“History repeats itself; ” but on being questioned by us as to the
particular instance that came to his mind at that moment, he returned,
‘Why, don't you recollect, before the return of Louis THE
EIGHTEENTH, or CHARLEs THE TENTH-or—let me see which was
it came first?” - -- - -
This was another item to be added to his list. Mont St. Micheli
as all the world knows from STANFIELD's pictures (Ithink he pain
it twice), a spot marvellously wild and romantic. The monastery,
the fortress, and the houses have hed themselves on the roc
like the sea-birds on Puffin Island. The monastery belongs, i
believe, to Friars Preachers: Friars Perchers would be a name in
accordance with the situation of their monastic nest. From
Avranches, from Coutances, on the one side, from Dol, Dinan,
Pontorson, on the other, and, indeed, from every place in Normandy
or Brittany lying within forty miles of Mont St. Michel, came omni-
buses, calèches, waggons with ngs, waggons without springs,
diligences of a fashiºn that must have been out of date in eighteen
thirty, carts covered, carts uncovered, in fact every sort of vehicle
imaginable and unimaginable, drawn by animals of all sorts and
sizes, on their first legs and on their last legs, crowded (the vehicles,
I mean) inside and outside with middle-class people, young, middle-
aged, and old, cheerful and decorous, all bound for the p º
but with as little of the fanatic about them as there was of the

rough English, jollity which you would see in a party of Sussex
eomen, with their wives and daughters, going in a van to Ringmer
S.
The Result of the tour was that we º up some excellent
dishes; and we decided, that, with goals and provisions at their
present exorbitant prices in England, the wisest plan for all English-
men, who could manage it, would be to go to Brittany, for the winter
and stop there. Here too is a wrinkle for Tourists vid Channel
Islands. Avoid Guernsey on Sunday. In fact, if you’ve seen
Jersey, avoid Guernsey in toto. Sunday at Guernsey is a day of
nitential discipline, when luxuries become necessities. London on
. liveliness itself compared with Guernsey. So strictly is
what they call the Sabbath kept, that the authorities of Guernsey
ill not allow the mails to land on Sunday, which are, therefore,
taken on to Jersey, and the visitor, anxiously looking for news from
home, must impatiently wait till Monda , though the expected
letter has arrived, and is actually lying in the Jersey post-office.
I complained to a Guernsey, man, in his glossiest, Sunday, best.
He pulled out his prayer-book, and, referring to the Decalogue,
insisted upon its authority for the Sabbath.
“Quite so,” said I, “but Saturday is the Seventh Day. To be
consistent, you must ão as the Jews, and keep Saturday. This is
Sunday, and the First Day of the week. You can't find, anywhere,
a command to make number one into number seven. Get out.”
He got out, and went to consult his minister. I trust some good
may result from this interview, if so, I shall claim to be the
Apostle of the Guernseymen.

in their good old time, considerably more tight t right.

A REFORMER'S REWARD.
THE Morning Post announces the presentation of a
“TESTIMONIAL To M.R. BEALEs.-MR. EDMoND BEALEs,
M.A., was presented yesterday with a gold watch and chain,
subscribed for by a number of tradesmen and artisans in recog-
nition of his efforts in extending the franchise.”
What was the value of the testimonial appropriately
presented to MR. BEALEs (M.A.) : A watch and chain
are articles which the grateful and enthusiastic admirers
of that distinguished ex-tribune of the people, might,
at one time, have bought very cheap. In the days when
BEALEs was wont to preside over intimidation-meetings,
a good many watches and chains may, unbought, have
changed hands in Hyde Park. For many a person,
respectable for his character and station, if not for his
intellect, will, although wearing a watch and chain, and
carrying money in his pockets, venture, out of curiosity
to listen to a mob-orator, into the middle of the people
assembled in the neighbourhood of the Reformers' Tree.
AFFECTION AND ECONOMY.
WHEN those we love are taken hence,
This thought may salve affliction's sore;
“We shall be lightened of expense:”
Or, “Now we shall get something more.”
But nought relieves our sorrow, when
Relations who maintained us go;
Yet most do we grudge mourning then,
When 'tis the garb of truest woe.

NEW BANK STOCK.
ODD things come to light in odd places. An unexpected discovery
has just been made in that romantic spot, the Bank of England. Å
bundle, not of old cheque-books, or old dividend warrants, or old
notes, but of “olilovº has been found in a chest in the
vaults of that matter-of-fact building. A thrill ran through the
Bank and all its branches when the news became known. The oldest
officer on the establishment had never heard, never dreamed, of
such a thing. The Beadle refused to believe it, and denounced the
whole affair as a hoax. The Governor, Deputy-Governor, and all
the Directors were at once summoned. They would have been glad
if the discovery in the vaults could have been kept a profound
secret, º of the effect, it might produce upon the next
half-yearly dividend. The Solicitors to the §. assured them that
no breach of its Charter had been committed. All sorts of rumours
were in circulation, and confidence in the character of the Bank for
st ess was not restored, until it was ascertained that the letters
dated back as far as the Restoration of Cºrm. SECOND, and
were not, as had been feared, the tender effusions of some senti-
mental Director or susceptible Chief Cashier of more modern times.
Restoration of the letters has been made to the present representa-
tive of the ºriginal writer (who the *# lady was does not appear),
and the Old Lady, is again tranquil. The º: of the Bank is no
longer disturbed, its Stock is as valuable as ever, and no alteration
in the rate of discount is apprehended.
Qne strange revelation of this kind often leads to another. The
public would, therefore, do well to be prepared to hear of the dis-
govery of a packet of Valentines, of the time of QUEEN ELIZABETH,
in a bureau in the National Debt Office, or that a tress of golden I
hair, tied round with blue ribbon in a true lover's knot, has been
found concealed in a trunk in the Woods and Forests.
BATH “BRICKs.”—The Liberal Majority.
UNDOUBTED SUCCESSES.
A column of German news contains the statement that:—
“The undoubted success of recent French and English pilgrimages to
Lourdes and Paray-le-Monial has induced the Bavarian Clergy to organise a
South German Pilgrimage to the same places.”
In what have those pilgrimages succeeded so manifestly that their
success is described as undoubted? The Pope still calls himself the
Prisoner of the Vatican, and the Count DE CHAMBopp has not as yet
ascended the throne of France. If any miracle has been performed
at Paray-le-Monial, Lourdes, La Salette, or any other hole-and-
corner, it has been kept dark, and may not come to light, perhaps,
for the next two or three centuries. The success of the pilgrimage:
to the two places above-mentioned may, as a point of faith, be un-
doubted by the undoubting faithful; but, as a matter of fact, at
least, “it hath not appeared.” However, there is no reason to doubt
that the pilgrimages organised by excursion-agents have paid their
managers, and thus, as commercial speculations, been crowned with
a success which, by the parties who have achieved it, is indubitable.
A Note of Sympathy.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
ONyour account I am very sorry for the agitation that has
been created by the anxiety of the Eton Masters to make a shilling
or two more a week out of the parents of the boys whom they have
undertaken to feed for a portion of the year. e temptation to be
facetious about Eton, eat on, eaten, eating eating-houses, &c., will;
know, prove irresistible to scores of ill-disciplined minds, and
you, I fear, will be the innocent sufferer. Now and then you reveal
to us the number of jokes you receive on sºme popular tºpic of the
day. . A little statistical information of this kind on the present
occasion would be acceptable to a circle of sympathising friends, who
meet every Wednesday evening at the LION AND UNICORN.

MR. PLUMPTRE, the celebrated elocutionist, declares his desire to
teach everybody to speak plainly and distinctly, and so to banish

wise people cause a speech to be repeated that they may gain more

is an insolence. As for the Fabian, he is to be baffled and discom-

QUESTIONS FOR THE CHURCH CONGRESS.
AMoNG the subjects set down for discussion in the H. of
the Church §. at Bath, one was described as “The means of
}.5 the Influence of the Church to bear upon the Masses of the
People.” It may be suggested that those who wish the influences
of the Church to be brought to bear upon the Masses of the People
will do very little to effect their object until they manage to prevent
the Masses of the People from continuing to be alienated from the
Church by the Masses of the Ritualists. -
Another subject entered for debate was that of the “Appropria-
tion of Seats as affecting a National Church.” Of course there can
be but one opinion amongst the Churchmen as to the way in which
#. #. is likely to be affected by the appropriation of seats in
arliament.

MR. BRADLAUGH, who is now on a lecturing tour in
the United State,' has been “interviewed,” like other
lions who visit our American Cousins. In the course of
the interview MR. BRADLAUGH expressed his willingness
to make a present of the British Aristocracy and the
Church of England to the United States. We have no
doubt the Aristocracy and the Church would be ready to
reciprocate the compliment, and to make the States a
present of MR. BRADLAUGH. We cannot imagine a
testimonial which would be likely to command a larger
subscription.

THE MUSSULMAN PLATFORM.
ON Tuesday last week, at Manchester, was held the annual
meeting of a General Council—one not of the Church. No ; that
assembly represented our British Know-Nothings; namely, the
Members of the United Kingdom Alliance, who have now proclaimed
that #. will know nothing in politics but the Permissive Prohibi-
tory Bill. The representatives of the Alliance leagued together for
the destruction of the trade in generous liquors, met in the Free
Trade Hall.
So far from being a Council of the Church, indeed, this General
Council of Permissive Prohibitory Know-Nothings appears to have
consisted chiefly of persons whose creed is quite another than that
of Christendom. SIR WILFRID LAwson, according to the report of
his speech in the Times, describing the policy of the United Kingdom
Alliance with respect to the law which at present regulates the sale
of liquors, said:—
“That policy was, disregarding both parties who had allied themselves to
this evil system, to show forth their faith by their works by endeavouring to
return men to Parliament who would go against the mischievous principle.”
The faith which SIR WILFRID Lawson wishes his Know-Nothings
to show forth by their works appears to be one of which few persons
have any idea that there are any votaries in the House of Commons.
But he himself represents Carlisle. And SIR WALTER C. TRE-
VELYAN, President of the Alliance, in his opening address from the
Chair of its general Council, declared that:-
“He could not repress a feeling of anxious foreboding for most disastrous
results from our too characteristic national love for strong drink, should not
some check soon be devised to the continued great increase and extension of
the terrible evils which must ever afflict a country whose revenues depended
greatly on the consumption of those infernal drugs, intoxicating drink and
tobacco.”
By intoxicating drinks, SIR WALTER TREveLYAN means, among
other drinks, wine, which intoxicates those who abuse it, and does
those who use it good. Wine, if the words above quoted are really
woº. LXV.
his, he calls an infernal drug. Of course he would not himself take
any of an infernal drug even for his stomach's, sake. Neither
would SIR...WILFRID LAwson; no more than would, unless he is a
humbug, the SHEIKH-UL-IsLAM. The º: applied by the Presi-
dent of the United Kingdom Alliance, the other evening, to wine, is
obviously inconsistent with any belief in its immediate production,
once upon a time, from pure water. The only faith that can be
shown forth by the use of that strong expression, surely is the
faith of MAHOMET. What says TREVELYAN EFFENDI ? Is it not so,
LAwson BEY P -
And yet Turks, who smoke tobacco, could not call, it also an
infernal drug; but then some Turks may not smoke, and may curse
tobacco, and be Turks and heretics too. However, the idea of the
Permissive Prohibitory Bill is perfectly Turkish; only, to make it
rfect, the permission to prohibit the sale of wine, and the other
rinks which SIR. W. C. TREVELYAN calls infernal, should be accorded
to a Pacha, or a Cadi, instead of to a majority of ratepayers, and
conferred, not by an Act of Parliament, but a firman. - - -
It appears that total abstinence from all but the weakest drink is
quite compatible with the use of the very strongest language.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE JOURNALS.
S MR. PUNCH has solaced
the wet days—that is,
most of the days in his
vacation—by reading his
contemporaries, he gener-
ously offers the Universe a
few of his scissor-notes.
Where Tarporley is,
and whether tarpaulins
were invented there, and
named from the place, we
do not know. But we do
know that it is a place
where prompt justice is
done:—
GEMS FROM
“TARPoRLEY.-Early on
Tuesday evening last it was
discovered that two fine sheep had been
worried which were in a flock belonging
to MR. FINCHET, of Beech Lane Farm.
The owners of the dogs which killed the
sheep had been shot, as soon as they
knew, to prevent any further outrage.’
We admire the expedition with
which right was done: we also ad;
mire the good feeling which delayed
execution until the offenders were
apprised of their crime.
he next is from the Birming-
ham Daily Post. We constantly
hear of the fastidiousness of our
menials, but here is a new case. A
housemaid declines to take care of an ugly child. But as no mother
can believe that her child is ugly, the announcement will probably
not prevent any person from writing to the advertiser.
Hoºp (experienced) At once, willing to take charge of a
Child, of nice appearance. Good references.—Apply, &c., Hagley
Road, Stourbridge.
But the following is far more interesting. It is from the Lirerpool
Mercury; and it seems to need no introduction, though the adver-
tiser n one. We are glad to see that the young lady is pious:—
A YOUNG WIDOW (29), resident of Liverpool, left with four pretty
... children, wishes to meet with a PARTNER for life. Has a houseful of
furniture in good condition. Would prefer a member of some denomination.
Is agreeable and kind. References exchanged. Address ***, North Wales.
“Four pretty children!” Who should know better than their
Mamma;. What is the lowest denomination that would suit her?
Will she take a Jumper, or does she draw the line at Baptists?
Some kind of Dissenting Parliament has been held at Ipswich.
Just before its assembling, a local paper put forth the following
modest appeal:—
“The Congregational Union will honour Ipswich with a visit before our
next issue. Not only the mental but the physical man will have to receive
attention; and all who can lend a bed-room may be allowed to entertain an
angel unawares. Let the Christians of Ipswich come readily and generously
forward to accommodate for a few nights the Messengers of the Churches.”
“Messengers.” Ah, you well-informed schismatic. You know
the meaning of “angeſs,” do you? But most people do not, and
that “entertaining an angel” (whether you ought to use Scripture
wºrds for your advertisements, you know best) was meant to be very
effective with pious sentimentalists. An angel with a woollen com-
forter and a fat umbrella is a new type.
Let us relieve our minds with something murderous—
HALLENGE TO WESTON VOLUNTEERS.—A gentleman resid-
ing within four miles of Weston-super-Mare is OPEN TO SHOOT any
Member of the Weston Wolunteers.
The Weston Volunteers (unless they can get a snap-shot before the
#!. is ready) had perhaps better keep beyond four miles of
eston-super-Mare.
An esteemed resident in Belfast has lately departed this life. The
Belfast Evening Telegraph makes the following announcement:—
“*.*. The length of MR. * * * *'s funeral has compelled us to omit our
first leading article.”
One has heard of driving a coach and six horses through an Act of
Parliament. . Here is a hearse driven through a newspaper.
The critic in the Eastbourne Erpress would do well, now that the
seasºn is over, to take a rudimentary course of English literature.
He has seen a display of fashionable dresses, and is “reminded of
N.
some beautiful parterre of flowers, where every colour is richly
blended, so gloriously described by MILTON.—
“Age cannot wither her, nor custom steal -
Her infinite variety.’”
MILTON's fine play, Antony and Cleopatra, is now performing at
Drury Lane, ...Pif the critic goes there and listens, he wiſhear the
words he has quoted; but, as EEN Q'BARBUsis, as his name shows,
an Irishman, he pronounces the word “steal” as stale, and, curiously
enough, it is so spelt in the books. This proves that MR. WHALLEY
is right in stating that Irish influence is everywhere.
Here is another thing that will be interesting to our Dissenting
friends:—
“COMMERCIAL TRIALS.”—A Baptist Dissenter, living in a retired
villa, in * * * is extensively engaged as a legal Accountant in eco-
nomically extricating persons from Commercial Embarrassments without
publicity, and with protection from arrests. º: persons, male or
female, thus situated, are temporarily afforded the comforts of a socially
religious home, and confidential counsel during retirement. References to a
Minister of the denomination required and given.—Address, &c.
Really, we could almost wish to be “commercially tried,” for the
sake of entering this socially religious home. Doubtless the hymns,
etc., are carefully selected with reference to the condition of the
ious but embarrassed guest, and the history of the Merciless
reditor in the parable, and similar narratives are “improved” for
his benefit. But we observe that such happiness is restricted to the
denomination. Only Baptists may be thus comforted. Might one
ask of members of that exceptionally stern denomination, how they
reconcile getting into “commercial trials” with the injunction
“Owe no man anything.” They are so desperately hard on Church
folk and other outcasts, that we may venture the question.
We penultimately present an advertisement which has evidently
been wr out of the writer by a long series of tormenting she-
menials. e heartily compassionate him, and trust that he may
get the illiterate person he wants:—
WANºp. a good GENERAL SERVANT, who can neither readnor
write, nor be able to do tatting, crochet, or embroidery. A
character is indispensable, and she must be able to cook fish, meat, and
vegetables fit to eaten. Any housekeeper who is parting with such a
treasure, or who knows of such a one out of place, will confer a favour on the
Advertiser by addressing, &c.
He wants something a good deal more like an Angel than the
beings who were to be entertained at Ipswich, but there may be
such a creature, and we trust that she will come to console the
advertiser.
Mr. Punch did not until the other day know Consett, but he
perceives, from its Guardian, that Consett knows Mr. Punch, and
treasures his epigrams. He hopes for long intimacy; and as there
is nothing so nice as an act of politeness at the beginning of a
friendship, Mr. Punch extracts a sage from the Guardian’s
“London letter.” The happy Arºn. of the Wale of Derwent
are informed that—
“The Opéra Comique has gone a little out of its usual course in giving us
serious Italian Opera, with a full company of Italian artistes and such a
prima donna as MADAME RIsroRI. But the boon of genuine operatic per-
formances at low prices is too great for Londoners, for them to question the
consistency of their being presented at the pretty little house in the Strand.
These performances are drawing large and appreciative audiences; and any of
your music-loving readers who may intend visiting London, should by no
meansmiss this attractive entertainment.”
This would imply that the London Correspondent has heard
MADAME RISTORI singing in Serious Opera, or he would not have
recommended visitors to attend. We have not yet had that ad-
vantage, but have sent to secure stalls for her first performance in
-- or "ºnal.
A Bad Road Blocked.
Miss RHoDA GARRETT writes to contradict the reports that her
canvassing against MR. HENRY JAMEs, as the most determined
opponent, last session, of Woman's Suffrage, was one of his Fº
helps to the head of the poll at Taunton. His friends must be glad
to hear it. It could not have been a pleasant thought to them that
a Member in every way so desirable should have found his way into
the House riá the Garret.
Canine Reflection.
DoEs that sagacious animal, a dog, think? If so, what is it pro-
bable that he thinks of the master who feeds him from his plate at
table? No dog, that can help it, will share his meal with another.
Perhaps the thought of the faithful creature really is one of wonder
what it can be that makes his master give away anything good to
eat.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LAW FOR THE LOWER ORDERS.
oRMERLY, in more
serious times than
these, it was be-
lieved possible to
make iº. re-
ligious by Act of
Parliament. An
Act, wisely intend-
ed for that excei-
lent purpose, was
p in thereign
of our most religi-
ous and gracious
King, CHARLEs.THE
SEconD. It is still
occasionally en-
forced, at the in-
stance of pious
informers, by de-
vout Magistrates,
at the expense of
nobody but cads;
chiefly smallgreen-
grocers and the
poverty - stricken
populace , of , low
neighbourhoods. A
case, however, has
- - - lately occurred in
which a Bench has been placed in trying circumstances by having
been invoked to punish, not the transgression, but the observance,
#.. good old statute. Witness the newspaper paragraph which
oilo WS:-
“SAILons REFUsing to WoRk on SuxDAY.-Ten sailors were charged
before the Southampton Magistrates on Saturday, by the Royal Mail Steam-
Packet Company, with combining to disobey the lawful orders of their
officers, in to work on Sunday on board the steamer Liffey, on her
voyage from Brazil to Southampton. The defence was that, under an Act of
CHARLEs the Secoxºn, they were prohibited from following their employment
on the Lord's Day. The Bench sentenced each man to seven days' imprison-
ment. Notice of appeal was given.”
It is to be hoped, in the interests of ºil; , that the con-
viction of these seamen will be sustained, even although the work
they refused to perform on Sunday should be shown to have been
quite unnecessary. The Sunday Act of CHARLEs THE SEcond was
never meant to justify disobedience to orders received on that sacred
day from a superior officer on board a vessel in a great Mail Com-
pany's line of packets. The aim of that enactment was to enforce
respect for the Sabbath on the lower orders; it was not framed to
incommode their betters called to a superior station of life. Should
the conviction of those sailors be quashed on appeal, the law it was
obtained under will have to be rescinded, or else the consequences
will be dreadful. *º the Court above should rule that no
servant is bound to do any work on Sunday for which there is no
absolute necessity. Is it necessary to drive a lady who is in perfect
health, and has the use of her limbs, a mile to Church when she can
walk, and it would do her good to ? Is there any real necessity for
cleaning boots on a Sunday, or even for cooking a dinner at the
request of those who can dine quite as well as they need to on cold
meat and bread? But, on the other hand, in case the performance
of these offices on Sunday shall be decided to be unnecessary, and,
not only that, but to constitute an offence under CHARLEs THE
SECOND’s Sunday Act, the greatest inconvenience and discomfort
will be entailed on the superior classes. The repeal of the statute
which forbids small tradesmen and common labourers and mechanics
from ſº their employment on Sunday will enable them, by
so doing, to fly in the face of the º with impunity, and to
ğ. e feelings of numerous respectable persons on their way to
urch.
PAROCHIALISM AT ST. PAUL’S.
St. PAUL's Cathedral has for some time had the reputation of
being, in a peculiar sense, extra-parochial. It is generally credited
with standing out of the bounds of Beadledom. But the City Press
states that the Rev. W. Rogers, who has abolished the “mob
caps” that were wont to be worn by charity-school girls in his
arish, was therefore “denied admission for the children of the
#: Sehools to the Cathedral at the annual gathering on
Thursday, the reason, being, it is said, that uniformity in the
appearance of the children would be destroyed.” This idea of
uniformity is distinctively a Beadle's. Mob †. are part of the
uniform of “charity” school-girls in the view of the typical Beadle's
mind. They are a specialty of the full dress of degradation which
the regular Beadle regards as indispensable for the recipients of
charity. This Beadle's notion of dº is the cause which per-
petuates the yellow stockings, girdle, and gaberdine of the “Blue-
coat” boys; and, to be sure, there is this to be said for it, that it
makes the genuine Beadle hug himself in the iº. of his own
blazing apparel. There is no Beadle externally of this gorgeous
{lescription at St. Paul's; but, unless our Civic contemporary has
been misinformed, there must be a personagein some authority about
that Cathedral, who orders matters quite after the fashion of the
thoroughgoing parochial Bumble, although officially attired in plain
clothes, or in nothing elsemøre ornamental than, º canonicals;
but, let us hope, in plain clothes only.

THE POPE AND HIS SLIPPERS.
WE learn this little bit of highly interesting news from a para-
graph describing the Pope's Wardrobe, which (the paragraph, not
the wardrobe) has lately been travelling upon the journalistic circuit,
or, in commoner phrase, going the round of the papers:–
“The slippers, of fine red cloth, embroidered with fine gold, and ornamented
with a cross, are worth from 120 francs to 140 francs. The Pope requires six
of these for the year; twenty-four pairs are, besides, always kept in the
wardrobe, and the Chamberlains are forbidden to give them away when cast
off, though many eagerly covet the honour of their possession.”
What in the world, then, can become of them? Are they sold to
the old clo' men, or are they laid up in lavender, as scented, we
mean sainted, relics of His Holiness? If the latter be the case;
what a number of old slippers must be treasured in the Vatican
Supposing five or six pairs have been }. by º year since the
Pope began to reign, one would think there must, by this time, be
a roomful of his slippers. Certainly, if His Holiness feel, the need
of an amusing pastime to enliven his seclusion, he will find at hand
abundance of materials for a game of Hunt the Slipper.
PROMOTION.—If the price of fuel continues to rise, Coal will soon
be entitled to take highermineralogical rank, and to be classed with
precious stones.

'O Boulogne and back, on !”.'";
day or two, while kind friends in
England are looking out for a horse for
ºld.
Happy Thought.—Here I am. On the }.". Low tide. What
a. # unpleasant smell! Friend who knows Boulogne says
it’s the drains.
Friend who knows Boulogne better than the other friend, says,
“No, it isn’t; because É.i. hasn't any drains.”, .
First friend, BARNLEY, who has studied the subject, returns,
#. that he begs pardon. No place has more drains than
oulogne. -
Second friend, CHINTON, inclined to be captious, observes,
“Superficial drainage.” - -
BARNLEY, unable to rebut the argument, admits, with regret, that
the drainage is superficial. -
Being interested in this (having come here tº see about getting
lodgings for my Aunt, who says that if I succeed in getting a horse
and go hunting all the winter, she doesn't see why she shouldn't
enjoy herself in a lively spot, where her two little wards can learn
French), I ask what do they mean by “superficial” drainage?
CHINToN replies, that it’s an official term for no drainage at all.
BARNLEY denies this. -
Happy Thought-As they are both getting warm ºn the subject,
drop it, and remarkthat there can be no doubt about Boulogne being
a pleasant place to stop at.
‘Depends for how long,” says BARNLEY.
“Yes, and what sort of a place you like,” says CHINTON.
“It’s healthy enough,” observes BARNLEY. - -
“If you once get acclimatised to the absence of drainage,”
remarks CHINTON.
“Not absence, CHINTON,” interposes BARNLEY, hotly. “Not
absence.” - -
“Say “superficial,’” I suggest; not having the slightest idea of
what I mean by it.
The word acts like a magic soothing syrup on them.
Happy Thought—The Superficial Soothing Syrup.
“Is it cold in winter here?” I ask, having noticed that, in most
other places, it generally is colder at that season than at others.
[Typical Derelopments—Notes on Climate—Vol. XIII., p. 261—as
the Publishers' advertisements say, “Shortly.”]
“Cold * * returns CHINTON. “Wery.”
“How can you say ‘Very’ 2’ remonstrates BARNLEY. “It’s
beautifully sheltered, and there’s hardly any very cold weather in
the winter.”
“How can it be sheltered º' retorts CHINTON, “when it’s on the
coast, and open to the sea F."
This does sound like a poser. -
“Sheltered by the cliffs,” explains BARNLEY.
“Cliffs be blowed!” says CHINToN, shortly.
BARNLEY and CHINTON always travel together, and are looked
upon as inse bles. I don’t understand them; but, on considera-
tion, put it down to Human Nature.
IHappy Thought.—Study BARNLEY and CHINToN. By the way,
-- pointed, he left by the next Boat, -(
they don't seem to study one another; at least, not with any very
satisfactory result.
They both go off together, promising to meet me afterwards on the
Pier, where I am going to breakfast at the Restaurant, which is, ap-
parently, the only thoroughly French #. remaining in Boulogne.
Happy Thought.—Go on studying Human Nature while waiting
for ºf:
Old Gentleman enters. The Dame du Comptoir cheerfully salutes
him, and, politely, the brisk Garçon takes him round the table,
where the materials for breakfasts and dinners are temptingly dis-
played (i.e., kidneys in geraniums, chickens in parsley, sausages in
masturtiums, and a real live quail, with chickweed, in a cage like a
rat-trap); but, in answer to the waiter's list, and after a close in-
ection with his eyeglasses, he says in English, “Nong, nong, I
on't want that, I’m looking for—” And he continues his search.
Lady at the counter elevates her eyebrows; waiter shrugs his
shoulders. More Human Nature. Also two more Human Natures,
French Boatmen taking raw spirits at a side-table.
Old Gentleman looks at me º: I catch his eye. He sees
in me a fellow countryman, and, as it were, clings to me.
“I have been asking them,” he says, addressing me, plaintively,
“for a bun.”
He must be seventy-three, if a day.
I inform him that, of all things in the world, he has just hit upon
the one º they haven't got. He thanks me sincerely, and dis-
appears. As I never again see him in Boulogne, I conclude that, either
having come to Boulogne for Buns, and, having been bitterly disap-
ãoing everything as much as
possible with the letter “B”—from Britain to Boulogne for Buns in
a Boat—reminding me of the old game, I love my love with a B,
because she is Beautiful; I hate her with a B, because she’s
Bumptious. I took her to Boulogne and treated her to Buns, and
her name was BEINDA) ºr he immediately threw himself into the

I am publicly—or rather restaurantly—thanked for my explana-
tion, and the sea-faring men treat themselves to another glass. .
During breakfast Imeditate whether digérer is to digest or to
direct. Satisfactory, however, to find that my explication was
understood.
IIappy Thought.-Coffee, cigar. Nothing particular to do ‘.
to ascertain, generally, by my own sensations, how my Aunt would
like it. Stroll back again to try the smells once more. Better,
much better.
Very lively place. Nothing but English º apparently.
Have always heard that “shady people” went to Boulogne.
Happy Thought.—Suspect everybody who speaks English, and
avoid any place which advertises Beer and Billiards.
(Odd; among the “B’s” again.) I do wonder that Buns are not
understood here. Why, there’s a Hotel de Bath, I believe. Per-
haps I shall read in the Hotel window, “Ici on rend les Buns
de Bath.”. Might start an opposition to the Hôtel des Bains and
call it Hôtel des Buns. Might be an attraction to one section of
society. My theory is that everybody represents a section of society.
That Old Gentleman who, evidently, couldn't get on without his
Bun, having, perhaps, never omitted it from childhood upwards, of
course represents one section of the public. Well, the Hôtel des
Buns would attract his section.
Happy Thought.—Start it and make a fortune. Foresee a number
of imitations immediately following suit. Hötel des Buns aur
prunes, Hôtel des Buns simples, Hotel des Buns d la Croir chaude,
Hotel des Buns d quatre sous, &c. &c.
Happy Thought.—Finally, only get a medical man to take up the
subject, write an Essay on Buns, and start the Bun Cure. Next
step, to set up an establishment by the sea-side, get in the course.of
two months testimonials from highly respectable people, Nobility

EDWIN JAMES IN ERROR.
THERE are JAMESEs and JAMESEs—HENRIEs and Edwins. HENRY
has just been returned to Parliament amid the general rejoicing of
all who know him; Edwin is trying to return thither, amid—we
would rather not say what kind of feeling. It is thirteen years
since MR. Edwin JAMEs had to vacate his seat for Marylebone, and
to leave his country, for his country's good. He has now returned
from the United States, a sadder man, we have no doubt, and, if we
We rather doubt this, when
we find him proclaiming his intention of coming forward again for
Marylebone." Punch doesn't like to hit a man when he is down;
and he has not said a word about MR. Edwin JAMEs's unavailing
attempts to procure readmission to the Bar. But MR. Edwin
JAMEs must not presume too far on his own abjectness. When he
ventures to stump Marylebone he must have forgotten that the
House of Commons is not the House of Representatives, and that
England—evenin its Metropolitan Boroughs-still requires character
in its Legislative Body. The man whom the Judges have unani-
mously re to re-admit to the Bar, is not the man whom any
English constituency can return to Parliament. Edwin JAMEs's
return to England is not an event on which, as far as we can see,
any person or community is to be congratulated, but his return to
Parliament would be a catastrophe which we decline to contemplate
as possible in even the most Marylebonish of Boroughs.
The Disease and its Remedy.
DR. ShEPPARD, of King's College, writes to the Times proclaiming-
what, we believe, was no secret to chemists—that the worst, mis-
chiefs of alcohol arise from the fusil oil, left in it by over-hasty
distillation. SIR WILFRID LAwson and his teetotal friends say that
if the disease lie in the “fusil,” the remedy lies in the refusal of
alcohol under all forms and disguises whatever.

Ritualism Avenged.
SoME of our Parsons talk a good deal of nonsense, but, to do anti-Parsons justice, they can
meet foll with folly. It would take much Ritualistic twaddle to outweigh a bit of logic just
propounded by a Mr. TILLETT, at Ipswich. He observed that the educated classes like to
go to church, while their inferiors do not. , True enough. . But from this he inferred that
at church true Christianity is not preached. . If we might compare carnal things with
Špiritual, MR. TILLETT would be as right in saying that because the masses prefer a music-
hall song to a composition by Brethoven, the latter did not write good music.
MOTIVE OF MUNIFICENCE.
A CoRRESPONDENT of the Times, under
the signature of “Observer,” enumerates
and sums up from its advertising columns,
in a single number, donations of no less
than “twelve thousand pounds from twelve
anonymous donors,” a thousand pounds
each, to various charitable institutions, and
some of those gifts from persons who have
iven more than once, one donation being a
fifth. The happiness which these munificent
persons must derive from the gratification
of their benevolent desires is, of course,
inconceivable by those who possess none,
although they may well enough under-
stand the blessedness of being able to afford
that luxury to an amount represented by
four figures, still more to an indefinite one.
But persons endowed with genuine sym-
pathy may, §: of it, partake of all
that bliss, although not having a sixpence
they can spare to bless themselves withal.
They, indeed, comprehend the motives of
beneficence; but there are too many
wretches who, if asked to account for the
l and numerous donations noticed by
-- rver,” would very likely suggest that
they were p led by atmospheric influ-
ences, some ing, like sea-weed and
mortar containing a deliquescent salt, liable
to give in wet weather.

Now, in these times of question and of doubt,

Reft of the shrunken realm that owned him lord;
Whose trust is in the alms he need not crave.

Face to face, each against the other's ken,
Bending defiant brows, and equal cheer.

Still the old quarrel—ancient as the world—
Which shall rule—claim of Church or sway of Law?
And are these champions, once more brought to blows,
After their many battles in the past,
To bring the world-old conflict to a close,
Or swell it by this fight—not least nor last?
OWER-LOADED WESSELS.
THE attention of MR. PLIMsoll is invited to the subjoined extract
from the Times:– -
“LITERATURE ExpoRTED.—There has been a large increase in the export
of printed books in the last three years. In nine months of 1871 the value
was £506,387; in the like period of 1872, £628,608; and in the last nine
months, £660,852.”
When it is considered for what quality the greater part of the
works which issue from the Press are most remarkable, a question
which naturally arises in every thinking mind is, what are the
weights corresponding to the sums represented by the above figures?
There is reason to º. that they are such as to render it pro-
bable that the vessels employed in the exportation of literature are
too generally laden to excess, insomuch, that a great many of them
have foundered and gone to the bottom under the ponderosity of
their enormous burdens. -

IN THE PREss.-On the Cure of Sore
Throats. An Essay hitherto omitted from
the works of the late THOMAS DE QUINSEY.
BISMARCK AND HIS BISHOPS.
IN the course of a Sermon lately preached, ARCHBISHOP MANNING
referred to the conflict raging in Germany between the ecclesiastical
and civil powers, and to the letters which have passed between the
EMPEROR and the Pope, delivering himself in language at least re-
markable for its candour. In particular DR. MANNING denied the
assertion “that the ecclesiastical laws which have been passed in no
way touch religion, in no way touch the conscience.” Having cited
the quarrel between HENRY THE SEconD and THoMAs A BECKETT, as
analogous to the present German difficulty, his Titular Grace went
on to reason as follows:–
“What has now been done in Germany? The other day men who refused
submission to the definition of an OEcumenical Council, and, therefore, to a
definition of faith, were justly excommunicated by their Bishops. These
men who were excommunicated for heresy were taken up and supported and
encouraged by the civil power and placed in offices of trust. By that act two
liberties of the Church were violated at once. . . . It was a violation of the
doctrinal authority of the Church. Next, it was a violation of the supreme
judicial authority of the Church to determine who are or are not faithful, who
are or who are not heretical, who are or who are not members of her com-
munion. Does not this touch religion ?”
Yes, dear DR. MANNING, it does touch religion, but not the religion
originally established in connection with the Prussian State. That
religion, did not teach the infallibility of your Pope. It was the
Old Catholic religion; and that religion has now been changed into
the Ultramontane. The Ültramontane Bishops, some of them having
recanted their own Old Catholicism, now pretend to excommunicate
Old Catholics. They excommunicate them not merely to spiritual
intents and p ses; the excommunication would carry with it
civil and political consequences, if the State allowed it to take effect.
But, if the State did allow it to take effect, this allowance would
touch religion still, and that religion the religion originally con-
nected with the State. The State has to choose, then, between
touching your religion, and touching the, Old Catholic religion.
BISMARCK, of course, decides that it shall touch yours. But in
touching yours what does it touch? Apparently to PRINCE BIs-
MARCK, no doubt, and certainly to MR. John BULL, it touches the
religion, which consists simply in believing the Pope's word, and
doing his will.
Still this is a religion which those who believe it have a perfect
right to hold, and practise also, as far as they can without burning
or otherwise molesting their fellow-creatures. But what right have
they to demand that the State shall encourage them in practising
their Popery, . to the molestation of others; and if they do
not like connection with the State, on the State's terms, should they
not content themselves with demanding to be disestablished and
disendowed P
GALLANT ENCOUNTER AND SIGNAL DEFEAT.
LAST Saturday was the anniversary (every day is an anniversary
of something, if people would only look at their almanac and culti-
vate their emotions) of the demise of the good KING STEPHEN. By
a curious coincidence, our tailor's bill came in that day, and, as we
looked at certain items, we could not help singing, with Iago–
“KING STEPHEN was a worthy peer,
His Breeches cost him but a crown.
He held them sixpence all too dear,
With that he called the tailor loun.”
“I would not be vulgar, if I were you, Mr. Punch,” said a Voice.
“I quote SHAKSPEARE, partner of my heart and expenses.”
“He could be #: enough when he liked.”
“Then take a higher authority, and for ever hereafter hold thy
peace. What saith the author of Ecclesiasticus touching the
raiment of AARON ? " He was clothed with perfect glory, and
strengthened with rich garments, with breeches.’”
“That is only the Apocrypha, and very likely translated wrong.”

obstinacy,” said Mr. Punch, shutting up.
American Happy Thought.
AN American gentleman, MR. CHILD, has offered to put up, in the
Abbey, a memorial window to good GEORGE HERBERT. *Twas a.
generous thought. But HERBERT had earned a little attention from
our cousins over the way:—
“Religion stands on tiptoe in our land,
Ready to pass to the American strand.”
However, whether this did or did not suggest the graceful offer, we
gº put it on record, and are glad that the excellent DEAN
TANLEY has accepted this enrichment of the temple he loves so
wisely and well. -

“Aren't wou?” asks CHINTON.
“I don't know,” I reply. “I don't know whether I am or not.”
This indecision is the result of years' experience. I consider it
safer to give myself out publicly as a bad sailor, on the chance of
turning out a remarkably good one, and astonishing everyone on
board; among others no one more than myself. y sea-sickness,
or, to use a more cheerful se, my sea-wellness, depends upon
ail sorts of things at different times, and can't be reduced to a cer–
tainty. I have known myself well and hearty during a seventeen
hours' voyage, enjoying sleep, º meals, enjoying, cigars or
pipes (this is very rare), and enjoying the vessel's urch, delighting
in the waves, revelling in the breezes, and smiling in pity on the
miseries of my fellow-passengers.
I have known myself—but not recognised myself at all as the bold
sailor above described—well, up to a certain point. This “certain
point” was where somebody said, “Now we’re on the bar.” I
replied faintly, feeling suddenly pale and staggery, “Are we?”
and, in another second, for no sort of reason that I could make out,
fixcept that this confounded man had told me “we were on the
bar,” I was groaning in agony, with my head in the wrong direction
over the ship's side.
I have known myself (again quite as somebody else in no way
related to the foregoing portraits) come on board, feel illimmediately,
long before the vessel was even in motion, foresee a fearful passage,
make all my arr , calmly, beforehand, even down to an
anticipatory tip to the steward to look after me as soon as possible,
and be very kind to me in particular, and then, on our leaving the
harbour and being fairly started, all qualms have nearly vanished,
and, finally, I have º off into a fitful and unrefreshing slum-
ber, only to be thoroughly aroused by being told, “Here we are!”
and in g myself at my destination without ever having been ill
at all.
I have found that sometimes the place for me was “below,” on a
º i once, and stay there. More often that “below" wouldn't
o at all.
Sometimes I have found that reading was an excellent preven-
tive; at others, that I couldn't read a line;
The conclusion of this is, without adducing further painful
instances, the Less of the Sea the Better.
The idea of a Tunnel is charming, if quite safe, and carried out
with taste.
IIa Thought.—On the model of the Burlington Arcade. Train
up and down the middle: promenade on both sides with shops. To
make the Tunnel itself quite secure, it should be the central part of

Exchange, and the top should be elevated several feet above the
level of the Chamei forming a handsome bridge, across which
pedestrians, who preferred this route, could, in fine weather, walk,
merely paying at one end, as at Waterloo bridge for example. I
make a present of this suggestion to the inglish and French
authorities who have the . in hand. I cannot see why this
can’t be done. Why isn’t it feasible? -
CHINToN says, “My dear fellow, if you were an engineer, you'd
soon see its utter impracticability.”
But I am not an engineer, and, if it were left to me, I should
bº it—in my own way, I admit" but at once. - - -
An engineer has his Fº to think of, his rules to go by, his
precedents, and so forth. None of these considerations would have
a pin's weight with me. I have often found that knowing nothing
of gardening, I have made such suggestions to Gardeners as have
erfectl º them by their originality, and they have
astened to adopt them.
I recollect one instance about i. A
Professional Gardener, very high up in his art, and always on a
ladder nailing something up, insisted that grapes wouldn't grow
where flowers were.
IIappy Thought.—I said “Try.”
As it was my own garden I did try. The grapes ºw beautifully,
so did the flowers. The High-art Gardener shook his head over it,
and said he’d never heard of such a thing before. It upset all his
theories, all his precedents, and from that moment he went in for
eccentric cultivation. He is now perfectly harmless.
“But what I mean is,” I say to BARNLEY and CHINTON, to whom
I propound my theory, “if the engineers won't do it, give the job to
some one who will strike out a new line, or at all events give some
one who has got a clear idea on the subject, and an interest in it,
the entire direction of the engineers, and let them simply carry out
his design.”
Happy Thought.—Myself. Director of the Submarine Tunnel Co.
Why not? I can tell a tailor how I want a coat made, a coat which
he had never thought possible before, though I can't make it myself.
I can tell a builder the kind of house I require, a house which up to
that time he wouldn't have ventured on building, and he'll erect it
under my guidance. There at once is the division of Labour, i.e.,
The Director and the Erector.
This discussion takes us to the Steam Packet Boat Office...There
is a boat going to-night, but it’s only a merchandise boat; it takes
bales, cargo, and luggage.
“No Passengers?”
“O yes, if you like to go by it.”
I would like to go by it certainly, as it starts at 10.15 P.M., and
arrives at 12.30 at Folkestone; and I do not object to being booked
as bales, cargo, or luggage. i will, if necessary, enter myself as
MR. BALEs, or MR. PortMANTEAU.
I take my ticket, and descend.
Dodge that-making you take your ticket on shore before you've
seen the boat. It is not inviting. Packages and boxes everywhere.
º deck; barely room to walk, and almost impossible to avoid
uddles. Below, small, close, and dull. Evidently it is not intended

are some of the
more important:-
It is recommend-
ed that the con-
versation, at all
meals taken in
common in Hall,
should be of a use-
ful and edifying
character, a defi-
nite subject being
allotted to each day
in the week. Thus,
on Mondays it
might be on Bio-
jºy, on Tues-
ays on Mental
Philosophy, on.
Wednesdays on
Physical Geogra-
--- phy, on Th ays
on Political Economy, on Fridays on Statisties, and on Saturdays on
Hygiene. As an agreeable variation, an arrangement might occa-
signally be made for some book to be read aloud, combining solidity
with cheerfulness.
“Caps,” as an article of female attire, being usually assumed at
a later period of life than that to which Students, as a rule, wi
have attained, their use will be optional. .
The Sub-mistress and tutorial staff will be happy to furnish
Students with the names and addresses of dress-makers and
milliners, who are prepared to study economy in combination with
Annexed |

elegance, and to execute all orders entrusted to them in accordance
with the dictates of taste and requirements of fashion; but, at the
same time, with an especial regard to limited allowances and inex-
pensive materials. -
Arrangements have been made, with Circulating Libraries of
repute for a regular supply of sound and wholesome light literature.
A list of works sanctioned by the College Authorities will be sus-
ended in Hall, and renewed every Saturday. (N.B.-Reading in
ed is strictly prohibited.)
Students §. to give a “tea" to a party consisting of more
than two friends, must apply for permission to the Sub-mistress.
No “teas” will be serve m the Common Room after ºt P.M.,
and no green tea will be supplied at all, on sanitary grounds. -
At the Mistress's receptions Students are expected to appear in
“ºf dress, but low bodies will not be de rigueur. -
In their correspondence with the opposite sex Students will be
restricted, to fathers, brothers, and uncles... No exception can be
made to this rule, without a written authority from the parents or
nearest relatives of the Student, setting forth the name and address
of the gentleman with whom she may interehange letters. Too
much letter-writing is discouraged, as likely to interfere with study.
Students who come up to commence residence already “engaged”
are requested to acquaint the Mistress with this fact, when they call
upon her for the first time: Any engagement formed during resi-
dence must have the formal sanction of the Student's family.
In Hall and in the Lecture Room Students are requested to present
themselyes neatly and quietly dressed; and, if possible, it would be
advisable to adopt some unobtrusive and uniform style in the
arrangement of the coiffure. -
The use of the piano must not be so excessive as to cause annoy-
ance to those occupants of adjoining rooms who may not be endowed
with musical taste.
The Sub-mistress and Tutors will be happy to advise any Student,
i. to what fancy work (if any) she should undertake in her leisure
outs.
In addition to the usual newspapers and magazines, Le Follet
and other journals of costume will be found in the Reading-room.
No Student will be permitted to use a double eye-glass, without a
certificate from an oculist.
Students meeting the Mistress will drop a §: courtesy: to the
d make a respect-
ful inclination. - -
Subscription to the C and Archery Clubs will be optional.
Only bonnets will be alſowed to be worn on Sundays.
No talking in the Lecture Room.

our REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
After the Lyceum he Reports to the Editor.
ONOURED SIR,
I REPRESENTED You the other night at The Lyceum.
- Never, Sir, within the recollection of the oldest inha-
bitant, who, of course, “saw MACREADy in it, by Jove, Sir,” never has this
wind-baggy play, Richelieu, been º on the º with such completeness
and close attention to detail as has been attained under MR. BATEMAN's
management at the Lyceum. The costumes, designed by MR., ALERED THoMP-
son, are admirable from first to last, and their individual effect is never
once lostbyinartistic grouping. With the scenery, too, no fault can be found.
What I have said of the grouping reveals to the º eye of Your
Representative no small ability in the stage-manager, whoever that important
functionary may be. So much for the frame, now for the picture. full-
length portrait of CARDINAL RICHELIEU. Perfect, as a picture: Imperfect as a
ormance.
Your Representative was struck by the consideration that even in his º:
fections it would be but just to give such a conscientious artist as -
IRWING the credit of having seriously thought it out, even where he seemed to
Your Representative to have thought it out wrongly. The Author has through-
out laid snares and pitfalls for the Actor, and ’tis difficult to avoid them all.
Much that MR. IRVING does is excellent, and evinces the most careful
study. But how has he managed to allow every notion of the Great Cardinal's
dignity to escape him?
Utterly absurd and false as is the language of the situation where Richelieu
threatens Baradas and his companions with “The Curse of Rome,” yet the
situation itself demands of the actor the sublime grandeur of the Inspired
Prophet of Heaven rather than the venomous utterances of a Mephistopheles
stretching out his weird fingers over his terror-stricken prey.
This is the scene full of pitfalls, for the author is perpetually at the bellows,
showing, not the divine, afflatus, but the inflatus—blowing the puppet out,
making him collapse, blowing him out again, collapsing him once mºre;
merely to eke out the business of a scene, and give the actor “something to do.”
ſº ing-doors, and bellow forth, in a voice which might
Is it a stage tradition, Your Representative wishes to inquire, that Richelieu,

after stealing off to hisroom with Julie and De Mauprat
—after having blown the lights out, and warned his
companions not even to whisper, he himself the while
speaking with 'bated breath, and creeping out on tiptoe,
so that the Conspirators approaching by the corridor
shall not hear the slightest sound—isit, I ask, a tradition
that, after all these precautions, Richelieu, having gone
thus stealthily out and §º should, after one
second's absence, thrust his head in between the fold-
be heard from here to the Crystal Palace, “We will
foil the bloodhounds yet!” or words to that effect,
for I don't know the play by heart (thank goodness (),
and the exact words were lost on my ear in the terrific
shout? Is this traditional? that is all I want to know.
Ispoor MR. IRVING, whose better judgment must revolt
against such absurdity, bound to do this because Great
Somebodies have done it before? Is it the Author's
stage-direction? Authors can be wrong sometimes when
Actors are right, as I apprehend was SHAKSPEARE him-
self utterly in error, and that artist (whoever it ...}
utterly in the right, when the latter, as Romeo, wo
have whispered, “What ho, apothecary?” had it not
been that the Author had made his Apothecary enter
with “Who calls so loud P’’
If the Author made Richelieu roar like a bull of
Bashan at this critical juncture, then on his head be it.
But if not, and if there be no tradition, what possible
reason (so I argued within myself) can MR. IRVING have
for behaving in such an amazing manner?
In the last scene MR. IRVING's Richelieu (grantin
always that the Author's º: was a very childis
creation, but to be improved on considerably), when
triumphant, raves, and absolutely elbows the miscreant
Baradas off to execution; he is in such a frenzy that
not even had he broken into a dance (as he §.
will, in the forthcoming burlesque at the Olympic
would it have at all rised Your Representative.
No: he lacks º act, he lacks it so much that
he has none at all. Yet all his tenderness for Julie was
most pathetic, and his manner with the youth François
ºº by a beginner, MR. CoNWAY) was admirable.
inally, Your Representative frankly admits that MR.
IRWING may be right in his interpretation of Lord
LYTToN's Cardinal, but he fails to see the reasoning that
would lead to such an interpretation.
Brief as Your Representative's notice must be, it
cannot be allowed to finish without most honourable
mention of MR. CLAYTON, who plays King Louis the
Thirteenth... Not a look, not a word, not an action, but
shows the thorough artist. Your Representative never
had the pleasure of seeing KING Louis THE THIRTEENTH
personally, nor does he remember having come across his
portrait, but, conversant with his character, he is quite
content to take MR. CLAYTON's version of his *.
appearance as a highly satisfactory detail, and heartily
congratulates the artist upon his whole performance of
this no longer small part.
Miss Isabel BATEMAN plays Julie Fº and tenderly,
was never, more winning than when she sits, at the
stern Cardinal's feet, pleading for a smile, and calling
him father. Altogether, Richelieu has been revived here
with more care and attention than were due to its merits
or to its weakness. MR. BATEMAN deserves success, an
I suppose that in this venture, as in the other three,
he has achieved it. YoUR REPRESENTATIVE.

THE priests and the more foolish part of the congregation at Saint

judge who ought to have heard the case is DR. TRISTRAM SHANDY.

that a canopy ought to be set up over an altar in church.”—“Duce take it,'

“The candidate was not prepared to answer any intricate questions, upon

DEMORALISING TALES.
THE attention of SIR WILFRID LAwson is respectfully
invited to an instructive police-case, which occurred the
other day at Guildhall. Two lads, Edwººd ENGLEDEw,
sixteen, shopboy, and HARRY TUCKER, fifteen, ware-
houseboy, were charged before MR. ALDERMAN ALLEN
with stealing ten pounds in money, and watches, chains,
studs, and a large quantity of goods, of the total value
of about one hundred pounds, the property of their em-
ployer, MR. J. A. Russell, of 37, Fore Street, ‘. pawn-
broker. . In the possession of these juvenile ro bºrs of
an Uncle was found a quantity of “trashy books,”
including The Footpad, the Smuggler, and The Prison
Breaker. These boys were both respectably connected,
and one of them, ENGLEDEw, had brought to service an
excellent character with him. They told the constable
who arrested them that it was reading those books that
had led them into trouble. Now, pernicious literature,
as incentive to crime, is worse than intoxicating liquors.
The generous and cordial beverages, called intoxicating
from their abuse, do not intoxicate if well used; then
they cheer and invigorate. . But pernicious literature
is pernicious in itself, and necessarily corrupts the
minds of its readers. They ought, therefore, to be de-
barred from all access to it, and what better means could
the United Kingdom Alliance devise for that p se
than the enactment of a Permissive Prohibitory *to
shut up all the booksellers' shops?
Students at Swindon.
THE Swindon Literary Institute pleaseth us much.
It wants two things—a Library, and a Billiard Table.
“It appears to be obvious that the Institute is not in a
osition to start both.”. At a meeting, and, after a long
iscussion, it was resolved to buy the-Billiard Table.
Evidently, the members think that it is not the Cue
of a Literary Institute to read. But as a slight con-
cession to the interests of literature, could they not
hang round the Billiard Room a lot of those, school
labels, with texts, proverbs, morals, and the like, for
the perusal of members, between the games? The
national schoolmaster of the place would, we are sure,
kindly select them, and thus might sport and instruction
be agreeably combined.
BETTER NAME FOR THE FUSION PARTY.—Confusion.

NO SURRENDER I
To hear a brave deliverance is a rare and goodly thing;
And France has heard a gallant one from her lineal crownless King;
A ºff who scorns to take a crown which is other than his own.
He will wear the same that his fathers wore; he sticks to that alone.
No crown for him of modern cast, remodelled and remade;
None with rebellion's badge in it, your tricolor cockade.
His emblem is the Flag of White—that must his banner be,
And yours; or you, ye men of France, at a distance he will see!
His is the faith of other days; his faith must shape his rule.
To say so shows him a true man, and, by your leave, no fool.
The hypocrite he might have played, as kings have done before,
And getting what they got by it, of himself made one fool more.
At need he law and order to maintain would dare by force,
And his law take from the Syllabus, as St. Louis' heir, of course.
He gives you that to understand, contemptuous of disguise;
Messieurs, he might have spoke you fair, and told you winning lies.
He bides his time—which nothing can but miracle restore—
But he believes in miracle—is a º y man therefore.
Honour to faith and chivalry, for o º dreams although they fight!
A Quixote as a Bayard is to the full as true a knight.
Two figures, odd and out-of-date, before the world yet stand,
And quaint they are, and queer to see; yet withal of aspect grand:
Fact in the face both fly, and each hopes on against all hope,
But they bear themselves with dignity, the PRETENDER and the Pop E.
For them and theirs the world seems like to have no country soon,
Where shall * find a resting-place that's nearer than the moon?
The moon and all the stars beside might fall about their ears:
Unflinchingly those twain would stand amid the tumbling spheres.
'Tis a right valiant quality, which admiration draws,
Firmness or obstinacy called, as in truth or error's cause.
And a fine thing is the fixed belief that doubt can never feel;
And the ºjº. snout, tail, bristles and all, is a marvellous
hearty meal.
FATHERS OF THE CITY.
SoME of the above gentlemen had, the other day (according to our
excellent friend, the City Press) what might be termed, if we were
vulgar, a shindy. In the Common Council there was a quarrel over
certain expenditure, and MR. DEPUTY FRY, who had objected to it,
was politely told that not half as much money would be spent in the
way complained of as he, the Deputy, had laid out in entertaining
the SHAH; and something was said about MR. FRY's being “in-
spired” to object. Then indeed there was a fry.
“MR. DEPUTY FRY thought it was a great pity that MR. BEDForm could
not differ from any member without making personal references. He (the
speaker) did not spend money for the entertainment of the SULTAN ; it was
e Court who º done so. As to any one inspiring him, this was a thing
he did not allow any one to do.
“MR. BEDford: I said it was not you.
“MR. DEPUTY FRY: You said the motion was inspired by the enemy.
Where is the enemy? Let the man be produced.
“MR. BEDford: I distinctly said not the deputy. Isaid the enemy.
“MR. DEPUTY FRY : Then I say who is the enemy? I have a right to ask
this... I defy MR. BEDFord to produce him. I declare before every member
of this Court that I was not inspired.”
This modest disclaimer of inspiration is all, very well, but the
utterances of the Fathers of the City are so plainly supernatural,
that we cannot accept the denial. No mere man could talk as these
superior beings talk. As LoRD BYRON says–
“ Fie!
I thought you had more religion, “MR.' FRY.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BABY-CARRIAGES WANTED.
ouTHFUL MR. PUNCH,
I AM what my
friends are pleased
to call a “regular
old bachelor,” al-
though, in point of
- fact, I am neither
* old nor regular, in
either hours or
habits. But, al-
though I am a
bachelor, I am not
averse to matri-
mony, at least, for
other people; nor
have I that violent
antipáthy to babies
which, I believe, is
not uncommon to
persons like myself,
who live in single
blessedness.
- Still, babies are
a nuisance in some
cases, I confess:
as, for instance, on
a journey, and un-
- der such conditions
as those whereof, the other day, I found myself a victim. Returning
from a holiday amid the mountains of North Wales, with mind con-
tented and serene, and nerves tranquil and at rest, I was disturbed in
my day-dreaming of the scenery and sunsets (to say nothing of the
mutton), which are still sweet in my memory, by the inroad on my
splitude of a Baby, and its rattle, and its mother, and its nurse. Sir,
there never was a pack of hounds that equalled this small creature in
the power of giving tongue. For fifty miles or more it continued in
full cry, and, when its vocal clamour ceased, it began a concert of
instrumental noises, which were hardly less distressing. Besides
the rattle I have mentioned, it was i. with a trumpet, and this
it blew and blew, until it wellnigh blew my brains out. After this
performance, it began to cry again—with hunger, the Mamma said,
and thereupon the nurse produced a pint of milk and a cooking
iº. an Infant's Patent Etna, I rather think she called it.
s volcano smoked away, and made a horrid smell, and clearly
contravened the law, for ours was not a smoking-carriage.
A short interval was here devoted to refreshment, and then the
concert recommenced, with doubled and redoubled vigour, and was
enlivened by a series of infantile gymnastics, which seemed to solve
the problem of perpetual motion. “I like mortals never sleep”
appeared to be the motto of this unwelcome little stranger; and,
though I could not but admire the patience of its nurse, what I felt
towards her charge was the reverse of admiration.
For the protection of the public from similar discomforts, I would
suggest that Baby-Carriages should be specially provided, and that
infants elsewhere should be rigidly ºil. †. is bad enough that
ladies, when travelling by train, should smuggle in their lap-dogs
with them, as they far too often do, to annoy their fellow passengers,
and to defraud the Company. But Babies are a far more serious
infliction, and it is certainly high time that a nuisance such as this,
which is certainly a º one, should somehow be abated.
In the meanwhile pray believe me
Yours resignedly,
A WICTIM.
OCCASIONAL HAPPY THOUGHTS.
Return to England. Search for Horse recommences.
12:30 A.M.–Latest bulletin from myself to myself: “Arrived at
Folkestone.”
Happy Thought.—“All's well that ends well.” Thank goodness!
ended well. -
A kindly sailor is at my elbow. “Had quite a nice berth of it,
Sir,” he says. This really means, “Look here: }. 've had a jacket
and tarpaulin in use all this time, and that can't be done for nothing,
yºu know. What are you going to stand?” I reply, cheerfully,
‘Yes, I hare had a very ºf berth,” but ignore the implied request.
He turns quite round to me, and almost whispers (adopting this sort
of undertone, I believe, so as not to be overheard by the Captain),
“I should like to drink your health this morning, Sir.”
Happy Thought.—No public-houses open after twelye.
As # § not, however, like to confront him with an objection which
would bring up vast political questions, on which he may have strong
opinions, it occurs to me—(several things often occur to me before
Ilay out sixpence in this way)—to ask him, “Are you the man who
lent me his tarpaulin and jacket?”
Happy Thought.—Be just before you are generous.
# compels him to own that he is not the man I took him for.
Then, I explain to him, he, personally, has no claim upon me... He
admits the justice of my remark, and, catching sight of the Captain,
Ifancy, who, like “the sweet little cherub” in the nautical ballad,
is perched up aloft, keeping a watchful eye on poor JACK–
—By the way, “a cherub perched anywhere is, a grand in-
stance of poetic licence. . [Note.--To g?, intº this thoroughly in
Typical Developments, Vol. X., under “C” for “Cherub,” Divi-
sion A., “Artistic Theology.”]— -
tº the kindly sailor is gradually absorbed into the deep shadow,
and, like a baffled spirit of evil, disappears in the gloom. .
Then the real man appears. Quite tic. There is an Eye,
too, from somewhere above on him, as he appears shuffling and un-
easy, and immediately on receiving the money (two strange, coins,
belonging to no particular nation, and given me in change with some
francs at Boulogne), he, too, glides away, and vanishes. He seemed
erfectly satisfied before he vanished. Perhaps I may have given
#. two rare coins, invaluable to a collector.
One other *. lands with me: a long man, in a long coat,
inclined to be confidential. I am not. *... the harbour.
No one in sight. Large Hotel near at hand. member it as first-
rate when I was stopping there. Everybody civil and pleasant.
Long man observes that he was not going there at first, but, since I
recommended it, he will. He was, in fact, he says, going to the
Hôtel de Paris, just on the º side; but since rºm going to
the Big Hotel, why so will he. Quite hearty and affectionate. I
telihim he couldn't do better, and it occurs to me that if the Big
Hotel is, as I’ve heard, chock full, and there's only one bed there,
which of us will have it i will, for choice, as i dºn't like the
sound of “Hôtel de Paris” in England: it’s too much like Leicester
ulare.
At the door of the Big Hotel. I anticipate a hearty greeting
(because, when I stayed here before, I had established most amicable
relations with the Bootses and Waiters generally), even though
qualified by regret at their being unable to give me the best bed-
room in the house. No †. of life anywhere. The Hotel has its
º shut, its eyelids closed, and you can almost hear it snoring in
the º; Boots is asleep, too.
#% hought.—The Sleeping Booty.
Ring hi #. ring him down; depends, of course, upon where
he may be. Through the glass door, we see Night Porter advancing.
I notice a deep, a very deep, growl from somewhere. Not a sharp,
short growl, with something in it of the ejaculatory brevity of a
satisfied grunt, but a prolonged, steady growl, proceeding, I soon
find, from something large and black underneath the hall table; a
growl not to be finished properly, except by a sudden leap out upon
the detested object, who, in this case, is myself, being nearer the
table than my Chance Companion. This is a cheerful welcome on
one's return to England! and so specially friendly in a Hotel.
“Any Rooms?”
The Porter, a very tall man, with weak knees, and only half
awake, is uncertain. Growling going on. Perhaps the dog has
come in late, and hasn't been able to get a bed, except underneath
the table, and he’s growling at that and not at us.
The uncertain young man is a Boots by day, and a Porter by
night. Another Boots appears: he is a short Boots. Blucher Boots
and (the tall one) Wellington Boots. Consultation between the two
heroes. I foresee the result: so does my Chance Companion, who is
beginning to regret that he didn't carryout his original intention of
patronising the Hôtel de Paris. -
Change Companion stupidly says to Boots, “I’m only here for
the night.” . Of course they won’t care what they do with him for
º one night. - -
he consequence of this is, that we shall be Numbers 269 and 266
in the books of the Hotel, and be stowed away among the boxes.
{ºp} Thought.—In order to prevent this, I will tell the Boots
that, if I like the place, I will stop here some weeks, and I remark
how pleasant it was when I was here some time ago.
I advance towards them in order to say this and ingratiate myself
with them. Wellington Boots requests me to stop in the Hall
where I am, and not approach the spot where he and Blucher Boots
are deliberating.
To this (being taken aback by this unexpected, rebuff from
Wellington Boots, and fº * all, idea of ingratiating myself
with him, at all events) I reply that “I shall stop where I like.”
Long Boots angry; Short Boots hesitating.
“Are there any rooms?” I ask.
“That,” answers Wellington Boots, irritably, “is what we're
talking about, if you’ll stop where you are.” -
I deny his right to order a visitor about, and have a good mind to
ring up the Manager or Fº whoever he is. If I knew which
bell would summon him, I’d do it.

Wellington Boots is wild at this. “Then,” says he, quite losing
all the temper he ever had, “we haven't any rooms.”
I insist upon it that there are rooms, and he suddenly lights two
chamber candles, and tells us to follow Blucher Boots:
My Chance Companion, who has been watching this scene, and
casting occasional pleading looks at me, as much as to say, “Don’t,
lease, or Ishan’t get a É. and I’m so tired,” now takes up his
ag, and is evidently pleased at the prospect of immediate sheets.
But I am resolute. T“Where,” I demand, “are these rooms?”
“He’ll show you, if you’ll go,” says Wellington, indicating
Blucher with his head, and turning away sulkily.
SCENE.-Hall of Hotel. Dim light. Arch, right hand, leading to
passage, where stands, pausing, Blucher with two candlesticks and
candles lighted, preceding Weary Traveller with hand-bag.. Myself
in the centre, with bag and stick, in a sturdy Cromwellian-take-
away—that—bauble sort of attitude. Wellington Boots going sulkily
back to his bed somewhere on the left. Growling accompaniment at
interrals from under the table.
N.B. . As they say in play-books, with regard to stage-directions,
the reader is supposed to be on the stage facing the audience.
“Are the rooms,” I demand, “at the top of the House?”
“They are,” returns the Long Boots, scowling, as though the
admission had been wrung from him by my severe cross-examination.
“Then,” I say to my Chance Companion, “you take 'em: I
shan’t. I shali go to the Hôtel de Paris.”
My Chance Companion, clearly wearied by the strife, throws
towards me one .."; glance, with something, too, of reproach
in it, which he §. ps means should haunt me to my dying day,
and follows the Short Boots as though I had ordered him away to
instant execution in a private room.
“Farewell, Brave Spaniardſ and when next —”, but he has
walked off.
I go to the Hôtel de Paris, Anglice superior sort of English tavern.
Brisk person to welcome me. m first floor. Large bed. Gigantic
washing-stand. Everything thoroughly English in the Hôtel de
Paris. Prints on the walls; a sufficiently rare collection to distract
me for some time from going to sleep. The subject of one of the
prints is the EARL OF RoxBURGHE, uis of something, Earl of
&c. &c., with all his titles in full, fishing in view of a Bridge and
Abbey; also portrait of the distinguished fish, which his Grace is
honouring by catching, and which is distinctly shown under the
water. By the way I only suppose the sportsman to be the noble
Earl, in question, in ...]". of the picture being dedicated to
him by his GRAcE's obliged servants, &c, &c., There's a glorious
picture over the mantelpiece of a magnificent bird, half swan, half
stork, in a Primaeval Pond, lighted up with a Turneresque sunset.
Then gradually off to sleep.
First morning in England.—Awake. Strange dream. Hasten to
note it down while fresh, because it’s so odd. I didn't dream about

Frantic Intelligence.
A TELEGRAM came from Penang the other day, saying:—
“It is rumoured that the Acheenese are burning their pepper plantations.”
Can it be credited that the Acheenese are such insane barbarians
as to cut off their noses to spite their faces? How absurd, too, the
idea of their burning their pepper plantations, as if it were possible
they could think their pepper was not hot enough already!
THE CANINE MYSTERY. -
RECENT revelations in Spiritualism have suggested the probability
that the inevitable dog that runs the gauntlet on a race-course is a
supernatural being. Opinions are divided as to whether, he is the
same thing as “the §. Hound in Man,” or an apparition of the
original Dog in the Manger.
LECTURES FOR LADIES.

THE CONTRAST.
ScENE–At a Sale of Antique Furniture.
WHEN the mirror politely stood still for a space,
And she viewed herself there in that reeking old place,
While the tribes clustered, grinning, all round her sweet face,
Such a picture was framed as one don't often see;
On our Catalogue's margin we sketched her, pro tem.,
And just added those lively descendants of Shem
For a background—the brighter and fairer the gem,
The darker and plainer the setting should be
NOTHING SETTLED.
IN this stupid and shop-keeping island of ours
Ere a maid lays, for marriage, her hand in a man's,
There are matters for settlement other than dowers,
And lº. to pop, before reading the banns.
First, the man is expected to make the maid proffer
Of his heart in due form, as a partner for life;
And the maid must have time to think over the offer,
And to weigh “Yes” and “No” ere she's bound as a wife.
Even courtship's mad fit has its intervals lucid,
For parties to\!. on the brink of the pool;
And oft “Ask Mamma,” ere a girl’s fairly nooséd,
Cuts the halter of Hymen, and kicks o'er his stool.
For that Hymen’s a hangman, needs no demonstration,--
Miss FRANCE's late husbands bear out the remark,+
From “altar” to “halter”'s a brief aspiration,
And to both men go blindfold, for leaps in the dark.
Wein England provide a young pair who mean marriage
With seasons for “spoons” out of third parties' ken;
Servant-gals, or swell misses who ride in a carriage,
“Keep company,” both, with their divers “young men; ”
For 'tis hoped that our female and male human-natures
Thus will learn of each other what “spoons” can disclose;
Though all who have looked in a spoon at their features,
Know how strangely distorted the image it shows.
But o'er Channel—'tis practice makes perfect, I fancy—
For much-married FRANCE, “on a changé tout cela : ”
That Grande Dame to whose matches no finis one can see—
May be won without wooing, like slave by pasha.
Nºy, in her case they’ve even waived popping the question;
“Third parties” have settled it all pro and con;
Though, for all either knows, each would more than the pest

At a late meeting of the Cambridge University Athletic Club were
chosen a President and a Secretary; and certain members were
elected upon the Committee. Among these gentlemen one repre-

acquire a new meaning. . It may be questioned whether, at our
Universities and Public Schools, a degree of attention is not devoted
to athletic sports conducive rather less to mental than to corporeal

It is said, by those who ought to know, that those who should

MAN.
SIR,-My dear Sir,
my very dear Sir,
excuse my excite-
ment, but I have
seen a great dra-
matic artiste. I
have seen a won-
der! An Actress,
in London, and on
a London stage,
who can enthral an
audience, can hold
them entranced,
awe-stricken, with
straining eyes that
would notwillingly
let a tittle of her
action pass un-
heeded, withstrain-
ing, ears impatient
of the dropping of a
pin, and waiting
upon each line as
- - though every word
~~~~ in it were uttered
for the first and
only time. This but
- for a few minutes;
an awful:few minutes, for we were watching the writhings of a
guilty soul in the Inferno, and worse than §: #. in its ter-
rible remorse. We, the audience, were for that brief period grouped,
as it were, with the physician and the gentlewoman on the stage; we
were hearing “what we should not,” and sat horror-stricken at the
confession of that most repulsive of all inhuman criminals, a Mur-
deress. Before the curtain rose on that short scene, we knew we
were to see, what we had come to see, MADAME ADELAIDE RISTORI
as Lady Macbeth; while the curtain was up we saw only Lady
Macbeth walking in her sleep: when the curtain had descended, and
had once more risen in answer to our call, it was MADAME ADELAIDE
RISTORI gracefully acknowledging the most fervent applause of a
house crowded and crammed in every part. This was on the second
occasion of her performing the part in English: she had done it for
her benefit on Tuesday: then, without puff or advertisement, the
report . spread about, that this of RISTORI's was the
most wonderful piece of acting that had been seen for years; and,
long before seven o'clockon Thursday night, it was almost impossible
to get a seat for love or money. Your Representative was a little
nervous about her accent; however this might have been on the first
representation, I can answer for it (as Your Representative, being
Truth itself) that, on the Thursday night, her foreign accent was
only perceptible twice; that, moreover, her articulation was per-
fectly distinct, and that finally, in my very humble opinion, there
was not, from first to last, one single fault to be found with this
most remarkable performance.
It is only when witnessing such a rendering of so, critical a
situation as is this of the sleep-walking scene, that one is aroused
to a sense of the boldness of SHAKSPEARE's genius. And to think
that he himself could never have seen his creation realised l at
least it seems impossible to imagine a youth, a mere lad, in this
art; and yet so it must have been. Was there ever a more
angerous situation devised by Dramatist? Think of the costume;
§ of the chamber-candle, of the physician and the chambermaid
up late at night and whispering in a corner; think, too, how the
very slightest over-acting would upset the balance, and render the
actress, and the whole scene, utterly and hopelessly ridiculous.
Man or woman walking, in sleep is, in reality, a ghostly sight; but
not so the mimicry of it on the stage, where we are not only pre-
#. for its unreality, but are ready to criticise its inartistic
efects as an imitation. Yet, Sir, when I recal that pale face, the
glassy set stare, the restlessness of the guilty hands, the stertorous
breathing of the Dying Woman in her last illness (for this is the
last we see of her—the next we hear of her is of her death)—
I protest I shudder again, and feel as though I, personally, were
now an accomplice, ex post facto, in the murder of the ji In an
Duncan, of Banquo, and the wife of the Thane of Fife.
Sir, this was a thirsty performance, and even to write of it,
earnestly, parches the º and dries the throat of one, who, though
deeply affected and unable to write on any other theatricai subject
this week, because this was really too much for him, remains now,
as ever, YoUR REPRESENTATIVE.
THE Oxford “UNION.”—Church and State.
EMOTIONS FOR ENSUING WEEK.
“Every day is an anniversary of something, if people would only consult
their almanacs and cultivate their emotions.”—Mr. Punch, Nov. 1.
NovemRER 5, Wednesday. 65uing faſukts. Read up the history
of this Blessed Martyr.
“GUY FAUx, GUY, with wicked companions contriv'd
To blow the King and Parliament up alive.”
“Contrived,” in the beautiful poem from which we quote, is used
in the sense of framing or devising a plan to do a thing; the word
is derived from the French controuver. For he did not accomplish
his purpose...Write an Essay, showing what would have been the
consequence if JAMES and his Parliament had gone aloft. Set down
memorandum never to make a Guy of yourself.
6. Thursday. . $t. Ltunatt... You never heard of him. What has
that got to do with it? A well-informed person is always reminded
of something by any name. Think of St. Leonards, and the delight-
ful walks you took there with MARIA, and when she had thrown
ou over, with JESSIE; and when you had thrown her over, with
LANCHE. how dear the lodgings were, and how bad the
eggs. Think of LoRD ST. LEONARDs, and recall anecdotes of him
when he was MR., or SIR Edward SugpeN, and his rows with
BROUGHAM. Name Leonard derived from Leonatus; read up Cym-
beline, and write.essay, on the character of Imogen. Look up St.
Leonard's, Shoreditch, in the Handbook of London, and drop a tear
over WILL SoMERs, the BURBAGEs, G. SPENSER, killed in duel by
BEN Jonson, and various other persons buried in the church. Then
go on to St. Leonards, Foster Lane (it is gone, and the Post Office is
on the spot, but that is a detail), and weep over FRANCIS QUARLEs,
who was buried there. Come, you get a deal of emotion out of a
name you thought unpromising. But such is genius!
7. Friday. 3Last &rttution at º 1783. Out with your hand-
kerchief; £ut just let us see whom we are going to blub for.
Where's Haydn's Dates ? He doesn't say... Never mind; dare
say the fellow deserved it. Quite sure the last man hanged at
Newgate did, 26th May, 1868, BARRETT the Fenian, who helped to
blow in the prison wall at Clerkenwell. Write essay on public and
private executions, and on Fenianism. Then write about all the
remarkable crimi who have died at Tyburn, where Connaught
Place now is. JACK SHEPPARD, JonATHAN #. MRs. BROWNRIgG,
DR. DoDD, PARSON HACKMAN. Ha! the last hanged there was
named AUSTIN, but his crime is not stated. You can weep for
grief that there should have been so much wickedness in the world,
or for joy that we are now all so good. -
8. Saturday. 305m ſtilton bitt. Take the º of reading
Paradise Lost, which you dare not, with your hand on your waist-
coat, say you have perused from “Of” to “way.” That will be
emotion enough for one day. -
9. Sunday. 3printt of ºlales harm. We should not think of sug:
gesting the sentiments with which our reader, and therefore a loyal
personage (or party), will hail this day. It is also the anniversary
of the judgment §§ by the Common Pleas, that apprised Miss
LYDIA BECKER that neither she nor any other lady had a right to
vote at elections. You can scoff at Woman's Rights, or gush for
them, according to your taste, or your idea of what will please the
company. -
10. Monday. Dr. Cumming born. Remember that, in 1861, he
delivered a lecture at Manchester (vide your Punch for October 26th
in that year), and stuck to it that 1867 would see the World out, in
some way, or would, at least, be the end of all chronology. He also
stated that he did not desire to be an Angel. Compare his utterances
with MR. DISRAELI's, who wished to be on the side of the Angels.
(“As if the Doctor didn't know he was already an Angel. Ask the
ladies of your flock. Flap your wings, yeould deluder,” said Mr.
Punch, with sweet #. ess.) -
11. Tuesday. # uarter Bag. There’s a ready-made emotion
here, as to-day one usually pays up the rent to last quarter day, or
is invited so to do. But this is a painful sentiment. Anniversary
of the election of MR. THoMAs CARLYLE, as Rector of Edinbur
University, 1865. He defeated MR. DISRAEII. Now comes, MR.
DISRAELI's turn to be a Scotch Rector. Moralise on the vicissitudes
of life, and on the law that brings everything to the man who knows
how to wait. . And now listen. On this day, in 1868, Parliament
was dissolved—then came the elections, and the splendid Party
Majority. “Were is dat Barty now?” - -
Come, dear boy, if you don't shine as a writer, or in conversa-
tion, or in both, next week, Punch must disinherit you, and never
call you JACK again.
COMPARATIVELY WELL OFF.
You hear people saying, “I’ve half a mind.” Lucky folks to
possess even so much as this! Many of us seem to have none at all.

IMPROVEMENT.
PARLIAMENTARY
Y the Scotch Striking Classes a
large demonstration was made
the other day at Glasgow ºff.
the Criminal Law Amendment
Act, the criminal clauses of the
Masters and Servants Act, and
the application of the laws, of
conspiracy to questions of la-
bour. For, although the laws
of conspiracy leave the Striking
Classes at º to conspire in
strikes, that liberty is not so
perfect as they wish. It does
not enable them to carry con-
spiracy to the extent of ratten-
- - ing, still less of maltreating
non-Unionists, and independent workmen who choose to * employment
on other than Unionists' terms. The Striking Classes are so far from being
free to H. such offenders, that, if the Council of a Trade Union ordered
that the house of one of them should be blown up, or himself should be shot,
and, their, sentence, were carried out, they and their agents in its execution
would be liable to be tried for murder, and might even, perhaps, be executed
themselves.
The demonstration by which the justice of the demands above, indicated
was made clear was quite as logical as could be expected even at Glasgow, in
Scotland.. “The people were marshalled on the Green, and marched through
the principal streets with banners flying and bands playing.” The reasoning
the drums and trumpets, no doubt, was irresistible, and even the most
K. ears must have succumbed to the syllogisms of the bagpipes.
umbers, or the arithmetic of multitudes, rendered the demonstration mathe-
matical. “The º numbered about 23,000, and the line of route
was crowded.” If further proof were needed, it was amply supplied by super-
abundance of stump-oratory. ...“On the return to the Green, speeches were
delivered from four platforms.” The rationality of all this eloquence is patent
from its results. “Resolutions were adopted demanding the total repeal of the
first of the Acts of Parliament above-named, protesting against the obnoxious
clauses of the other, “and Fº the meeting to support only those candi-
dates for Parliament who will give effect to their wishes.”
This pledge, if generally adopted and acted upon by Trades' Unionists,
may tend considerably to improve the representation of Great Britain.
If, then, the Trades' Unions, the Teetotal Societies, and
the confederacies of all the other platforms, will seve-
rally vote, each band of them, only for “those who will
give effect to their wishes,” the votes of the main body
of the constituencies will probably return a sensible
majority, unfettered by class interests, and exempt from
crotchets, to Parliament. As the Brethren say, “So
mote it be.”

Perhaps a trifle streaky.]

THE ALLIANCE LOWING CUP.
ON, Monday last week the Lord Mayor elect was,
according to ancient custom, presented, and described to
the LoRD CHANGELLOR by the RECoRDER. To the descrip-
tion of the Heir Apparent to the Civic Crown, given by
the Hon. and Learned Gentleman, an appropriate and
complimentary reply having been duly returned by the
noble and learned Lord; according to the newspapers:—
“The Loving Cup was then passed round, and the Civic dig-
nitaries retired.”
The time at which the ceremony thus concluding com-
menced was about half-past eleven A.M. The Loving
Cup, therefore, was passed round a little before noon, in
accordance with the more early than abstemious habits
of our ancestors. Whereas the contents of that goblet
is a sort of negus, that is, an “intoxicating liquor,”
what will become of the Loving Cup in case the Alder-
men of London should ever grow so unmindful of their
traditions as to elect a consistent Total Abstinence Lord
Mayor? Will the Loving º in that case hiss with
sherbet, or foam with ginger-beer; will it be charged
with sparkling or still lemonade: or is it even possible
that º: Loving Cup will be reduced to toast-and-
water:
Bobby Black-sheep.
SoME persons complain that, the organisation of the
Police Force has become too military. In one particular
it is not military enough. Of late, unworthy members of
that generally well-conducted body of men have been
disgracing their corps by brutal assaults, by taking
people into custody for speaking to them, by locking
up sufferers in fits of º or drunkards, and, by
false swearing in Courts of Justice. Military discipline
is not, at present, as it * to be made, applicable to
exceptional Policemen. e it enacted that all such
offenders shall be liable to be flogged and drummed out of

QUESTIONS FOR SCHOOL-BOARD CANDIDATES.
HAVE you made yourself acquainted, by reading and personal
investigation, with the educational systems *: '. (a) ancient
nations, (b) foreign countries, and (c) England and her dependencies,
from the earliest times to the present day?
Are you conversant with the principal educational theories which
have been propounded, both at home and abroad, since the beginning
of this century?
Have you read all the Blue Books and other Parliamentary docu-
ments which have been issued on the subject of Education?
What system are you prepared to support in this country? Do
you advocate a denominational education for an undenominational
child, or would you train up an undenominational boy or girl on
denominational principles? Can you suggest any plan which
would be likely to prove satisfactory to contending sects and #.
rival public meetings, the parents of the children, the children
themselves, and the ratepayers?
Have you read and studied the Education Act under which you
seek election, and can you quote the famous 25th Clause?
What sort of education did you receive yourself, and can you
point to any prizes or distinctions gained at school or college?
Will you be good enough to describe the plan you have adopted
in the education of your own family?
Have you had any practical experience of teaching?
Please to give an outline of the Bell, Lancaster, Pestalozzian,
Kindergarten, Moravian, Jesuit, Port Royal, Privy Council, British
and Foreign, and National Systems of Education; and to state
whichº" prefer.
Would you confine education simply to reading, writing, and
arithmetic; or extend it to such branches of knowledge as men-
suration, political economy, perspective, chronology, modern lan-
ages, chemistry, counterpoint, and international fº or are you

#. ?
Committee Meetings, to make no lengthy speeches, and to avoid
contradiction, interruption, and personality?
Are you fond of statistics? -
In any future legislation on the subject of Education, are you of
opinion that it would be desirable to make it compulsory on all those
who avail themselves of the opportunities for mental improvement
afforded by schools º out of the public, funds, to present
themselves with clean hands and face; or would you consider an
enactment of this character an unwarrantable interference with
that liberty of action which is the pride and boast and birthright of
every British subject, and a dangerous disregard of time-honoured
º. such as ought to be treated with the utmost tenderness
and respect? - -
Is it your chief desire, not to help on the triumph of Secularism,
or Voluntaryism, or Denominationalism, but to see every -

ELECTRIC SHAWE.
THE idea of “Ajax defying the lightning” is rather *ś
suggested by a telegram which came the other day from Sicily,
contradicting a previous telegram, thus:-
“The news º by an English journal of an earthquake having
occurred in Sicily, of an eruption of Mount Etna, and of the destruction of
some sulphur mines, is completely unfounded.”
Ajax may be considered as represented by the author of the tele-
gram which announced the thing that was not. He, whoever he
was, lied in defiance of an electric current. That is re ly defy-
ing the lightning in a small way... Might not, this fellow be called
the Lesser Ajax-without prejudice to the fair fame of Oileus?
His telegram announced a destruction of sulphur-mines to an extent
which, had it really happened, would have created a famine ºf
sulphur. Perhaps this intelligence was calculated to affect the
sulphur market, and thus make defying the lightning to the cost of
a telegram pay a speculating rogue.

OCCASIONAL HAPPY THOUGHTS.
In Search of a Horse. w

home, the report

within a radius of
at least ten miles.
I ask my Aunt if
she has mentioned
it to any one.
“No, my dear,”
she replies, “I’ve
riot said a word on
the subject.”
She seems as
hurt and annoyed
as if I had ac-
cused her , of
having divulged a
most important
secret.
... I can't go any-
where in my
own neighbourhood
without hearing
about the horse
think I want to raise
that “I'm looking out for.” People seem to
a private cavalry troop. -
At the Railway Station, for example, the Station-Master—the last
}. I should have thought of, as connected with horses (unless he
as a grudge against the Railway, and wishes to encour iving)—
smiles pleasantly, but still knowingly" i can’t help j." is
universally, that whenever a person, no matter who he may be, has
anything to say or do about horses, he instantly becomes more or
less knowing in his manner—I believe the Archbishop of CANTER-
BURY himself wºuld cock his shovel-hat, and smile learily (“learily”
is the wººd) if he had anything to say about a horse-Well, the
Station-Master smiles in this way, and observes—

.say . Yes, I am,” as unconcernedly as possible, as I have a sort
of idea that he’ll suddenly produce º #. the 'engine-house, or
the porters' room, or some unexpected place, by way of taking me
by surprise, and say “Here he is, Sir; here's the very thing for
you!’. and expect me to purchase it on the spot.
So I am reserved, and suspicious. As I go on, I become more
reserved and suspicious. My nature is, I am sure, originally
and trustful; but lººking out for a horse will, I am sure, even at
this early stage, embitter my life.
I almost begin to expect menjumping out at me, from behind trees
or Fº with “Here you are, Sir! here's the thing to suit you!”
and, I am aware of being perpetually, and painfully, on the alert.
The Station-Master seems to be thinking the matter over. I don't
É. away and leave him, as I see he has something more to say.
erhaps, not being professionally a horse-dealer, he doesn't quite
#. ow to put it, or it may be his first attempt at this sort of
Ing.
. He frowns to himself, as it were, and appears to be going through
either some violent mental effort of memory, or a struggle with his
better nature and his early religious education.
I ask him, “Have you #. of anything **
‘Well,” he replies, slowly, the struggle evidently not being quite
over—“Well, no-not exactly, only ºf see he's coming out
with half the truth)—“there's MR. Fost of Barntree was sayin
the other morning here, as he had something as he thought º
do for you. I don't know it myself,” he adds, cheerfully; “but he
Was ºn; As he thought it was about the sort of thing as you
wanted. And,”
he had relieved his conscience at last, and turned Queen's evidence
ag. inst fºtº: * i. to make him an accom-
1ce, sal R. FoSSIT as he tter k to -
Hºli. Up Train for Lon'on!” spea you about it
By the time he has ended he has resumed his own natural honest
and pleasant manner, and is at his work again, with the air of a
man who has successfully combated a fearful temptation.
. I can imagine...that is my increasing suspicious nature can
imagine, what, will take place at the next meeting between Fossit
of Barntree and the Station-Master.
Fossºt (whom I don't know from ADAM) will come up with the
usual deep smile and begin,
;
he finishes, with increasing cheerfulness, as though |S
...Well, have you seen him since? Eh?” . -
The Station-Master, perfectly aware that he is alluding to me, but
i. afraid to admit that he has thrown Fossrſ over, will pre-
tend that he doesn't quite catch his (FossIT's) meaning.
FossIT will then continue, cautiously, “Have you seen MR.
THINGUMMY about that horse, as I was—” .
“O !” the Station-Master will cut in, to avoid further explana-
tion. , “Yes, and I told him he'd better see you about it himself.”
And so he will go off, leaving his companion to understand that
he, the Station-Master, won’t be a party to any duplicity about this
horse, and isn't, to put it plainly, going to stand in with FossIT of
Barntree. -
Again, in the village, I hear of it from the Post-Master. In part-
nership with his mother, he is proprietor of a cheese, bacon, and
grocery shop, and this, and the post-office, they manage between
them. He is a long young man, loosely put together, as if he'd
been made up gradually, and added to at different times when-
ever there might have been some large bones to spare. His face,
which is broad and round, and with a very uneven surface, is
expressive of chronic astonishment at everything and everybody. I
don’t believe he was always like this. -
I fancy the telegraphic arrangements have frightened him, and
that every arrival, or sending of a tele , conveys a fresh galvanic
shock to his nervous system, taking effect on his hair, which is very
dry, and of the colour of one of his own pale Dutch cheeses. He has a
desk to himself in one corner, where he attends to the Money Orders,
occasionally º when the customer's back is turned, to
come up again in the character of a Telegraphic Clerk, in another
corner, where the wires work among sides of bacon, sacks of dog
biscuits, soap, cheeses, and red herrings. From this operation he
emerges quite red in the face, as though they were .# such
things by telegraph that no ... young man could listen to
without blushing. I drop in to buy some stamps.
Happy Thought.—Object for a walk, to go to the village and buy
stamps. Must have some object in view, or should never take any
exercise. When my horse is here I can ride in and buy stamps; or
ride to all sorts of villages for miles round to buy stamps. Could
(for the sake of making a necessity for exercise) invent for myself a
pleasant fiction as to their selling better stamps at one village than
another. The farther the village, the better the stamps. Besides,
there's something of the genuine countrified idea abºut this: it’s
like going about marketing: it suggests the pillion and my Aunt up
behind with a basket: Old #. jog-trot, top-boots, heavy-
handled whip, low-crowned hat, and dialogue along the road.
“Well, Fayrmer, 'ow be’est this marning * an 'ow be yew mam? "
and then we say, we're going to buy some stamps, and trot on... Of
...; this is fanciful, but still there is a pastoral sort of idea
about it.
... A shilling's worth of stamps; please,” I say.
The Young Post-Master, astonished as usual, appears to be taken
aback by this demand, and as he cannot at the moment lay his
hand on the stamps, an animated discussion ensues between himself
and his mother, who is having tea in the little room behind the
glass-windowed door, and won’t come out. . -
The Young Post-Master wom't open the door and show his mother.
He seems to keep her in there as a secret, and, as he speaks through
the door, and turningfa little away from me (his audience), its
effect is to remind me of a Ventriloquist's entertainment, where the
performer pretends to be holding a conversation with some one on
the other side of the wall, or outside a door. -
“Mother, where didyer put the stomps?” he says, in his own
Voice.
Wentriloquist's mother (Imean Post-Master's mother from within),
“You’ll find 'em in the drawer o' the left’and side, John.” -
Post-Master rummages in the drawer, and calls out, “No, th’aint
there.” Then he goes to the door again, turns the handle, and
holds it the slightest bit ajar, which is exactly what I’ve seen
Wentriloquists do, only without a real mother on the other side—
ordinarily some imaginary acquaintance called “ToMMY,” who has
got somehow into a gas-pipe, or some eccentric stranger in the
chimney, who is usually ºd with the utmost courtesy on
the part of the Wentriloquist, as “Sir ; ” each sentence beginning in
this way, “What are you doing up there, Sir?”, to which Eccentric
- .# the Chimney replies, rudely, “What's that to
you, Sir
... I have noticed that the Eccentric Stranger in the Chimney...is
invariably rude, while the Ventriloquist is most markedly polite.
The Man in the Chimney refuses to move, and asserts his right to
stay there as long as he likes; the wentriloquist, still polite, warns
him that, he is lighting a fire, when the Eccentric i.
becomes abjectly piteous, and only asks for time to be allowed to
reach the top and make his escape. By the time he has gained this
oint the Eccentric Person's character has quite changed; he has
ecome less and less rude, and finishes §. the top of the
chimney, and supposed to be out on the roof) by wishing the enter-
tainer “Good night,” to which the amiable Wentriloquist below

replies, “Good night, and mind you don't let me catch you in the
chimney again, Sir,” which remark, elicits a faint §: In a very
distant voice, almost three houses off by this time, “ right, Sir,

This passes through my mind, while the entertainment is being.
given by the Post-Master and his mother in the shop. . -
He finds the stamps under the butter, which surprises him less
than I should have thought, and, haying carefully wrapped them in
brown paper, hands them to me, saying, at the same time,
“Thank you, Sir.”
Then he has to find change for half-a-crown, which causes another
entertainment with his mother in the back parlour, as to where the
change is that some one brought in just now, and was put by mistake
into the Money. Order drawer.
This being found, he gives it to me, and observes, “Are you
settled yet, Sir, with a horse? I heard as you were looking about
for one a while ago.
I tell him I am not suited, and he calls out to his mother,
“I say, Mother, where was that as MR. Holt's Coachman said as h
he knew there was one to be sold?”
“GRANGEBY's,” answers a voice from within.
“At GRANGEby's,” repeats the Post-Master, explaining to me the
answer of the Oracle in the back room.
(Note for Typical Development, Vol. XIV. O. Oracles, how they
were done in ºld times, '6, 6–0ſi Oracles. Never hit on the
subject before.) -
GRANGERy’s; it's the builders, Sir, along here, top o' the hill.
I think it's the sort o' thing that might suit you, Sir.”
Why should a builder's horse suit me? Why should the Post-
Master think so P
#% Thought.—What does he want for it?
The Post-Master doesn’t know ; doesn't suppose much. I pretend
to take a note of GRANGEBY’s address, and thank the Post-Master.
Hºg, Thought.—GRANGEBY's is too near at hand; no excuse to
o to GRANGEby's. Besides, what’s a builder to do with horse-
ealing Suspect something wrong here. No. As I originally
intended, I’ll call on CLUMBER, the *ś he, as it were, lives

edge has been dawning on my mind for man
}. and a day, or two ago it burst into full light. Coming from the Crystal
had spent no less than fourpence in the terrible amusement of
THE RAILWAY AND COAL RING.
As if the cost of coals had not been raised too high
by the conspiracy of extortionate and lazy colliers, the
Railway Companies, it seems, must needs combine with
the Coal Merchants to enable each other to fleece the
F. at their mercy. According to the Post, Railway
irectors refuse to carry coals for private purchasers at
the pit's mouth. In this refusal they are warranted
by a judicial decision, perverting the Railway Act of
1854, which forbids them to give greater facilities to one
class of the public than to any other. This prohibition
has been ruled in a Court of Law to mean that they may
decline to carry coals when they please.
Is it not, then, indeed, high time for a dissolution of
Parliament? Railways, and Railway Gentlemen are far
too strong in the House of Commons. Britons, country-
men, and householders, you are continually invited to
vote for this candidate or that, the one who will or
who will not pledge himself for or against the twenty-
fifth Clause of the Education Act, or something else
of equally vast consequence. If you know your own
interests, but do not know whom to vote for, you may
at least know whom not to vote for. Among these latter
candidates, the Railway Companies are doing all they can
to place all who stand for them. You will be very
blind if they do not soon succeed in making you see that
the candidate not to vote for on any account is a Rail-
way Chairman, Director, Official of any kind, or any
other person who, if returned to Parliament, will repre-
sent not you, but those who º you under legal
sanctions, and get the sanctions legalised, in the capacity
of Railway Members. Study the published lists of the
Railway Men in view of the coming Election.

Who tells her, willy-nilly, she must swallow his warming-pan.
“So, chers Docteurs, take my advice: don't try my temper more,
Lest I should take the liberty of showing you the door:
And if you thrust your warming-pan into my bed, I doubt,
I may take to insisting, mot-méme, and kick it out.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
Regrets and Reports.
RIEND OF MY SOUL,
LIFE is full of
regrets. For your
sake, for the sake of
the public, I do re-
gret my inability up
to this present mo-
ment to visit the
Alexandra Theatre,
near Regent's Park.
Day after day has
. eye fallen on the
advertisement, “See
APHDAL,”—and ah!
Sir, I have not seen
her. Every morning
as Iopened my Times,
there it was, growing
more and more re-
proachful in its as-
pect – “See APH-
DAL.”
“APHDAL!” I ex-
claimed. “I come!”
—but I didn't. .
Pleadingly the
advertisement has
lain before me. And
now I see, that ere
these lines shall have
fallen in pleasant
Fº APHDAL will
ave vanished for
ever, for the Opera
wherein she was per-
forming (I have as-
certained that APH-
woman of the SHAH,” has from the present moment
of writing only four or five nights more of stage exist-
ence, at the Charing Cross. Then she, too, will have
vanished, like a bright meteor, and have joined the
Resplendent APHDAL in the land of Spirits.
I cannot be everywhere at once. I often wish I could
be somewhere else when I'm where I am. I saw Sour
Grapes at the Olympic. I looked at it through a fog. The
fog had penetrated into the house—had filled it. º Was
very foggy on the ºft. that night. MR. ANSON was very
ood as the Country. Bumpkin; and so was MR. CHARIES
EvDLLE as the Willanous Aristocrat. There was the
Farmer and the Farmer's wife—honest couple (at least
I believe so, only the º was so thick I could not get
clearly at the story), and the Farmer's daughter—virtu-
ous, and in love with a Lord. And there was the Lord in
love with the Farmer's daughter, and disguising himself
in order to court her. And there was the usual Charles
his Friend, and the dashing young lady (MISS FowlFR),
in a riding-habit, looking so bright in spite of the fog,
and having a telling exit speech, which brought me down,
and, after me, the house; and then there was the
Lawyer, with the will in his pocket, to be produced at
the fight moment; and then there was the Haughty
Lady of high rank, who wouldn't consent (strangel
enough) to the marriage of her son, the noble Lord,
with a Farmer's daughter; and there were the two

LITERARY ANNOUNCEMENT. —In the Press—Yester-
day's Tablecloth.
A HEATHEN UNDERTAKING.
A REMARKABLE instance of the vast inferiority of the Hindoos to
ourselves, in point of civilisation and enlightenment, is recorded in
the Times of India. According to that journal, there lately died at
Bombay one of the principal inhabitants of that city, MR, WENAYE-
CRAo JuggoNATHJEE SUNKERSETT. The remains of this benighted
Hindoo were disposed of by his equally benighted relatives after
the barbarous fashion of the no less benighted antique Romans.
They were subjected to the unphilosophical process of cremation.
This was preceded by various ceremonies, of course more or less
absurd, and by superstitious recitations, which Brahmins are pleased
to call prayers. me money had necessarily been expended on the
pyre provided for this heathen funeral; but an English undertaker
would be shocked by the mean simplicity of the article of its furni-
ture thus described:—
“A word about the bier: it seemed to us to be a rather shabby affair, con-
sisting only of split bamboo sides and arms, and with a rush bottom; but as
the bier itself was subsequently broken to pieces and burnt, it perhaps served
its purpose as well as a more ostentatious one would have done, and at no
expense worth mentioning.”
This was indeed worse than rather a shabby affair. It was a very
shabby affair indeed; altogether the reverse of “respectable,” as
our undertakers expressively call the expensive but necessary fur-
niture which we do not burn and waste at once, but inter to moulder
in due time. ...
When we think of the advantage, derived by this country, in
point of ornament, use, and sanitary progress, from the continued
extension and encroachment of cemeteries on commons and open
spaces, we cannot fail, to see how much more wisely we dispose of
our dead than those who do so as follows:–
“Then the flames shot up into the air, a canopy of smoke overhung the
spot, and all was over; the mourners dispersed, and by midnight nothing
remained of our well-known citizen but a handful of white ashes and a few
calcined bones.”
That is how the yotaries of Juggernath use the form of organic
matter relinquished by the spirit of a Juggonathjee. They reduce it
in a few hours to phosphate of lime and other earthy salts, having,
in the meanwhile, driven off its combustible portion aloft in the
form of gases into the atmosphere. Thus they practise what
MR. O'BRALLAGHAN calls atmospheric interment. e more reason-
ably allow derelict organisms to decompose at their leisure, and the
i. of their º to mingle, some of them, with the
air which we breathe, whilst others leak away into our wells and
constitute ingredients of the water which we drink. We have no
heathen prejudices.
RUSSIAN SCANDAL.
Russian Scandal is an amusing game. The Nord contains a letter
from St. Petersburg, and here is a slight extract. The Correspondent
states that the marriage of the či Duchess is fixed for January,
and that on the occasion the Court of the CzAR will receive the visit
of the PRINCE and PRINCEss of WALEs,
“du duc de Cambridge, oncle de la Reine Victoria et généralissimo des
armées anglaises, et enfin de l'archevêque de Westminster et de son épouse,
dame d'honneur de la Reine d'Angleterre.”
We all know that the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE is the QUEEN's uncle,
of course, and that the ARCHBISHOP of WESTMINSTER has the
honour of crowning our royalties. But we did not know that DR.
MANNING was married, and, therefore, could not be supposed to be
aware that Miſs Manning is amºhonneur to our quºis. But a
continental journalist's haughty contempt for facts is part of the
nobility of his character.

Captain of Schooner. “What 'A' You Got THERE, PAT * *
Pat (who has been laying in some Firewood and Potatoes). “TIMBER AND FRUIT, YER Honour !!”
PERSECUTION IN PRUSSIA.
THE persecution now º: in Prussia presents a modified
resemblance to that which the early Christians from time to time
suffered under the heathen Emperors. By accounts from Germany
it appears that the Prussian Government has been persecuting ARCH-
Bishop LED0CHovski with peculiar barbarity. No less than forty-
three lawsuits have been instituted by that heretical Administration
against that faithful Prelate.
“The total amount in which the Archbishop has been hitherto fined is
1,300 thalers. The first 200 thalers are covered by the sale of his carriage
and horses. For 900 thalers the Archbishop is offered the alternative of six
months' imprisonment. The remaining 200 thalers have been imposed in
punishment for MossIGNoR LEDochovski's refusal to appoint a legally
qualified priest at Filehne in lieu of the unqualified one for whose institution
he has been fined the first 200 thalers. It is said that a second carriage and
pair will be seized in satisfaction of this debt.”
None of the primitive Confessors and Martyrs ever underwent
anything exactly like this: neither IGNATIUs, nor PolycARP, nor
CYPRIAN, nor any of the rest of them, are related to have suffered
the seizure of a carriage and pair. Some were mutilated very bar-
barously indeed; but whether under NERO, or TRAJAN, or DECIUs,
or DIOCLETIAN, or any other of the persecuting Emperors, at any
rate Bishops used not to be deprived of their carriages and horses.
Perhaps, to be sure, though they kept their consciences, they did
not keep their carriages, as ARCHBishop LED0CHovski does, or did,
before he had all of the latter taken away from him by the tyranny
of a Kaiser WILHELM, whom ecclesiastical historians will perhaps
denounce as a persecutor exceeding in atrocity the worst of all the
Roman Caesars. In the meanwhile, let us hope that LED0CHovskI
will find some modus rivendi under his country's laws which will
enable him to keep his conscience and his carriages too.
QUAKER TO COSTER.
FRIEND, crying “Warnuts ten-a-penny!” cease,
Walnuts, not “Warnuts,” offer men of peace.
AN ARMY OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND.
AN announcement of the very #. importance has been made
public within the last few days. It is one which affects the comfort,
the peace, the pecuniary interests of it is no exaggeration to say-
a large proportion of the inhabitants of these isles. From John-o'-
Groat's House to the Land's-End there is hardly a town, a city, a
village, an extra-parochial place where it will not be received with
mingled and varied feelings. The peer and the peasant, the rich
and the poor, the old and the young, the married and the single, are
all alike concerned by it. There is not a rank or class in society
which it does not involve; there is not an hour in the º there is
not a day in the year, when its influence will not be sensi ly felt.
To come at once to the point—we felt that without some prefatory
words of preparation and warning, it would be unadvisable to give
still further publicity to a statement so momentous, both to present
and future generations, heirs in tail male, and children yet unborn,
at a time, too, when there is already sufficient depression from the
weather —the announcement we refer to is that “as many as
14,053 Attorneys, and Solicitors, Writers to the Signet, Proctors, and
Notaries, took out the annual certificate authorising them to prac-
tise, in the financial year 1872–3.” -
This is not all, there is something more to come—“The number is
229 more than in the preceding year.” -
Have we exaggerated? W; can wonder at the Bank Rate?
A Congenial Taste.
It is a remarkable fact, which has hitherto escaped notice, but
will now meet with universal recognition, that Dairymen, when they
take to reading, are generally found to prefer rather a milk-and-
water sort of book.
to A Correspondent.
A “Husband with an Incompatible Wife” has evidently been
misled by a misprint. We have heard of “Elastic Webbing Bands,”
but never of Elastic “Wedding” Bands.

When Civic Kings retire;

And so say, “The Lord MAYOR is dead;
Long life to the LoRD MAYor!”
Now, when the Pope of RomE departs
This sublunary state,
The Faithful must, with anxious hearts
For his successor wait.
An interregnum there must be;
Meanwhile, which may be long,
Where is Infallibility,
The rule of right and wrong?
The Civic with St. Peter's Chair
A link should thus connect:
Let this, as that has a Lord Mayor,
So have a Pope-Elect.

Long live His Holiness!
PRECIOUS WORDS.
AccorDING to the estimate of a provincial newspaper,
MR. BRIGHT's late speech at Birmingham is “worth its
weight in diamonds to the Liberal cause.”
This is a fine-sounding, though scarcely novel phrase,
and is, doubtless, meant to mean that the words of MR.
Bigºr are words of priceless value and considerable
weight... But a critic might remark, without unseeming
levity, that words are light as air, and, in reality, impon-
derable. Regarded from this unpoetic point of view,
speeches worth their weight in diamonds may be of
precious little value, unless the speaker be permitted to
throw into the scale the thickest of the newspapers which
happen to report him.

Holland House contains the following passage with reference to the
closing scene of the distinguished Author of Cato, and contributor

“We would like to believe DR. YoUNG; but whether he" (ADDIsoN)
“died “as a Christian,’ or whether he died ‘of brandy’ in what is now the
gay dining-room of Holland House, there the great man died.”
Away with the groundless, supposition that ADDISQN died other-
wise than a Christian | At the same time, it cannot be denied that
saying, “See in what peace a Christian can die,” is quite compatible
with dying of brandy-and-water. The force of those words, which

IT is understood that the marriage between the DUKE of EDIN-

then, for ARCHDEACON DENISON, or some other such steadfast cham-
pion of Anglican orthodoxy, to press, in the *:::: uarter, the
suggestion that, when the Royal Pair are married in the form which
rescribes, the Athanasian Creed should be intro-
duced into the Marriage Service.

BONNETS AND CHIGNONS.
HE following extract from the
Times affords primâ facie evidence
of the moral and intellectual
advancement of Woman:–
“CHANGE of FASHIoNs.—Only
£29,525 was the declared value of
hats or bonnets of straw imported
this year, whereas in the year 1872,
in the same period, the amount was
£48,714.”
The difference between these
figures apparently corresponds to
a saving in ostentation on the
outside of the head indicative of
a great expansion of the faculties
and their organs within. Ac-
cording to Phrenology, the aver-
age female brain should have
grown considerably larger in the
course of last year; at least in
the intellectual region. But,
before we deduce from the dimin-
ished value of bonnets imported
the gratifying inference that
women during the past twelve
months have risen in the scale of
reason, let us ascertain the sums
which, for the same period, represent the consumption of false hair.
EMOTIONS FOR ENSUING WEEK.
“Every day is an anniversary of something, if people would only consult
their almºnarks and cultivate their emotions.”—itſ. Punch, Nov. 1.
Now FMBER, 12, Wednesday. Charlts 33 emble bitt, 1854. He was
a fine actor and a fine flºº If you knew him you will not
want any hints... But if you did not, yet have seen him, you have
a splendid pull in all companies where the talk is theatrical. If
you know a young actor, who desires your opinion of himself, say
encouragingly, that acting is an art not to be learned in a day, an
that CHARLEs KEMBLE was rather a stick at first, and was made
a great artist by his brother and sister, and close study, Tell
É. le who never saw him that they have not the least idea of what
high comedy means, and then smile to yourself, as if recollecting
his stroll into Angiers (King John), his pulling the nose of the
ruffian (Inconstant), and his vexation when his scented handker-
chief was taken from him (Much Ado). Imitate his habit of un-
consciously speaking very loud indeed (being deaf in late years),
when his gentlemanly instinct made him endeavour to whisper, lest
he should pain anybody present. If you shout loud enough, the
whole table will have an emotion, but whether it will be altogether
in your favour “depends.” If to-day you are in the company of gen-
tlemen of business, remind them that it is the anniversary of the
3)anic of 1857, and as perhaps some of them may have been hit, either
by that or last week's, there will be more º emotions. You
can allude to the capital article in the other day's Times,
i.; the Share Market, and making it clear to the most
humane that the immediate execution of every member of the Stock
Exchange is the first trifling detail towards reformation.
Thursday. 33ank Charter ºrt $uspenbrü, 1857. This followed the
smash of the Western Bank of Scotland, and the various disasters it
inaugurated. The preceding hint about commercial gentlemen, and
what would please them may be again available. LoRD PALMERston
and SIR GEORGE LEwis acted in the matter—you can easily diverge
into anecdotes of both—tell your friends sayings of “PAM "-you
must know plenty. “Dirt is only matter in the wrong place.”
“All children are born good.” “Better attend to your º
than ask for a Fast.” And quote SIR. G. LEwis's remark that life
would be yery pleasant but for its pleasures, and then poke the lady
next you in the side and ask her, with a loud laugh, what she says
to that. Possibly there will be a good emotion aroused.
Friday. $t. Šternutus. 33. Another of the unknown immortals
of the Romish Church. We dare say that you will him in
Butler, if you like to look him up. We shan’t. His name suggests
a joke on sternutation, and ºts in all the stories about sneezing.
Be classical, and cite
“His nose is so long he cannot hear his sneeze,
And therefore never doth he say, Heaven bless me!”
Tell of the man who was inside the theatrical elephant, and sneezed
so violently that he shook the trunk off—pantomimes are coming on.
Tell of the lady who hid in the clock to learn the secrets of a Mason's
lodge, and sneezed, so the brethren dragged her out and put her to
death—affirm solemnly that it was done at the Freemasons' Tavern,
and that you have been shown the room, and the marks on the floor,
like the Rizzio ones at Holyrood. Appeal to a Mason, if you happen
to know that one is 'present—the outside he will say is that he }.
never been in that room. If you want to create a strong emotion,
show the company how to stop, a fit of sneezing, by tying a string
(which you will have taken with you) very tight round your next
neighbour's forehead.
Saturday. |}rintt of &alts returnt from ºſmerica, 1860. If there
is an American at table, your course of compliments is clear. If
not (but be sure), you can be as sukkastic, at the expense of our
hospitable and warmhearted cousins, as many people think it very
fine to be. Do not forget º who sang the first line of
a then *. American ballad, “Let me kiss him for his mother.”
Remember that at one of the balls the carpet was nailed down by
some workmen who forgot that some others were hermetically sealed
up in a hollow space below, and how the poor fellows' cries were
drowned by the music, but that they were ultimately released, at
the PRINCE's request, the managers of the ball decidedly thinking
that the men might just as well stay below till next day. Of course,
the name of H.R.H. will introduce any late anecdotes, and you can
put his name to anything you invent (everybody does it) as nobody
can contradict you.
Sunday, ſtnian 3Ltattre frntentſ, 1867. Here, naturally, is afforded
a capital text. We assume that you go only into civilised society,
and therefore are not likely to meet anybody who would desire the
release of these wretches. You will therefore express the senti-
ments of all around you in hoping that MR. GLADSTONE will continue
firm. You may remind your hearers that one of the fellows was
very violent in the dock, and declared that he would not give
374 cents for the something British Constitution. Recent demon-
strations will afford you an opportunity of being glad that some of
the Irish Communists are safe under lock and key. With other
remarks which may not be novel—we do not want novelties
in political matters—but which are to the purpose, and as this is
Sunday a certain seriousness is laudable.
Monday. * Canal Optnth, 1869. There’s a splendid opening
for you, if you have ever been in the East. In fact, if you have,
and you do not take the whole talk to yourself, you have mistaken
your vocation. If you have not, look up Eothen, cram a little, and
if you object to telling a downright One (which you should not
mind in the interest of your fellow-creatures), say in a superior
manner that any man acquainted with the East knows, &c.
anybody ventures to ask you whether *". have been there, say,
“Have I?” with an ineffable smile, and look round at the others
as much as to entreat their pardon for such an ignoramus as the
questioner. Then go it—give first-hand, if you have it, if not,
second-hand. Sound the Oriental names in the new-fangled way
-call Aladdin, Al, ah, Deen. We need not enlarge on this hint, an
intelligent man must be able to tell enough lies about his Oriental
experiences to secure himself a dozen invitations. If the other folks
would standit, imply that you bought a choice assortment of beautiful
Circassians, but this you will introduce with careless tact, and then
you will glide from the subject.
Tuesday, juntral of the Duke of Øſtlingtºn, 1852. This is not
a promising subject. All the anecdotes of the DUKE (and a great
many more) have been told to death. But the date is twenty years
back. If you § in for middle age, you were an interesting young
fellow in ’52. It rests with yourself to tell of a most singular thing
that happened during the funeral, and of the protection you
afforded to a lady in the mob, and—and, in fact, how you created
an impression—and just what you please—but the next time you
met her was at a grand dinner at a house of a nobleman “whom,
perhaps, I need not name,” and you took her down, having utterly
orgotten her, and how she said that was not the first time she had
been indebted for your arm. This is a skeleton outline of a story—
fill it up--we have seen a much stupider one (if possible) interest a
whole table. You don't know how good-natured the world is—it is
only boys who fancy that people are cynics.
Fifth and Second.
THE French Republicans are of opinion that it is enough for
France to have been conquered by one HENRY THE FIFTH.
The Newdegate-Manning Problem.

THE COMING ELECTION.
IN two or, three of the Metropolitan School Board
Districts, Ladies—well qualified for the office they are
willing to undertake—are offering themselves for elec-
tion. This is proper Woman's work—far more suitable
for her than w g the hospitals, or interfering in
borough elections, or addressing excited Female Suffrage
meetings; and we cordially wish that Marylebone, and
Chelsea, and Greenwich may all return lady representa-
tives. MISS BECKER has already been chosen on the New
Board at Manchester, where there would seem to be
ample scope, for her energies in providing for the
education of her own sex; for taking part in the election
in that city “there was a j. number of
women, voters, among whom the illiterates were largely
found.” It is too late to improve the present generation,
but the next may be made happier and better, if there
is not too much squabbling over clauses and systems.

Distinctive Spelling.
THAT appliance of a Railway Train which serves the
Engineer to pull it up short is called a Brake. Why?
Before Railways were, a brake meant fern, brambles, an
instrument for dressing linen or flax, the handle of a
ship's pump, and a baker's kneading-trough. None of
these things arrest progress. A contrivance to break
speed, if denominated from its use, should be named a
reak... Orthography, perhaps, is violated to mark a
distinction between the Railway Brake and the Railway
break-down and breakage of bones which the brake too
often proves inadequate to avert.
Escape of a Lunatic.
A PLAN for the improvement of the harbour and
approaches of Whitby, at a cost of £105,600, has been
approved of by the local authorities, and an early appli-
cation will be made to Parliament by Mr. Énior the
excellent and clear-headed Member for North furham,
for authority to carry it out. An inmate of Colney
Hatch, allowed to read newspapers, remarked, on meet-
TheRE's ling in one of them with the foregoing intelligence, that
matter to provide the harbour with a jetty.
A POINT OF PRUDENCE.
A CoRRESPONDENT of the Times, “T. A.,” relates in what manner
he was once seized and locked up by the Police, and brought before
a Magistrate at Marlborough Street on a false charge of asſaulting
them in the execution of their duty, All this annoyance “T. A.”
says he incurred by simply, following a crowd, which crowd was
following some policemen who were conveying two drunk and dis-
orderly women to the station-house. In company with a friend he
followed this crowd “to see what was going on.” Having gratified
his curiosity by seeing the women put inside the station-house, he
encountered a º: at the hands of a policeman, who rushed out
of it and collared him
Never follow a crowd merely “to see what is going on.”. That
can generally be seen at a safe distance from the crowd, and is then
always seen to be not worth seeing. What is going on is very
seldom anything new. It has gone on innumerable times before,
and will continue going on repeatedly for ever. A million to one
you will be none the wiser when you shall have seen what is going
on. Almost certainly you will be none the better; very probably
something,, and perhaps a good deal, the worse. You, may get
hustled and bonneted, have your clothes torn or your hat beatenin,
or your head punched, or your toes trodden on, or your pocket
#. All these misfortunes together even may befall you.
aving seen what is going on, say a row, you may find yourself
nailed to describe it, in a witness-box; first at a police-office, and
then at the Central Criminal Court, or the Middlesex Sessions, or
some other sessions or assizes, at which you will be kept dancing
attendance for a week, having, in the meanwhile, had this nuisance
for some months before you to look forward to, .# .
peace of mind. º,iſ. may get yourself collared by the Police,
as “T. A.” did. By following a crowd to see what is going on, you
constitute yourself one of the crowd. Joining a lot of foolish people,
you make yourself like unto them, are then confounded with some-
body else among them, and taken into custody for that other; the
Police pouncing on the wrong fool.
If, with all these consequences before your eyes, and your eyes
open, you deliberately follow a crowd for the purpose of seeing what
is going on in order to interfere with it possibly for the public
advantage, or the protection of some fellow-creature or creatures
unknown to you, at the risk of being maltreated, mauled, robbed,
subpagna'd, or locked up, that is another affair. Well and good;
then you are no more a fool than a knight-errant was. You go in
for self-sacrifice; you are taken to a station-house here, but hope
to be rewarded for it hereafter. This expectation may sustain you
in the cell you are thrust into among the thieves and drunkards;
but be quite sure of your motive before you follow a crowd at the
risk of incurring confinement in that society. - -
The crowd that follows policemen walking off prisoners in charge,
resembles the flock of small birds commonly seen at the tail of a
hawk skimming along with a chicken in its talons. By-and-by the
hawk suddenly turns round, ºf s, and snatches off, one of its
troublesome attendants as well. The fate of the little bird in this
case is just such as that which appears to have been experienced b
“T. A.” Do you wish to avoid it P. Then respect yourself so mug
as not to allow a gregarious instinct, like that which actuates the
lower ereatures, to impel you to follow a crowd of people for no
wiser purpose than to see what is going on.
Italian Imagery.
SPEAKING of Count CAvour, the Mayor of Turin said:—
“Thanks to him the star of Savoy had become the sun of Italy.”
A brilliant metaphor, no doubt, but of questionable novelty;
Had the orator, descended from astronomy to horticulture, and
simply remarked, that the Cabbage of Savoy. had grown into, the
full-blown Cauliflower of Italy, the observation would have been
immensely more original, and hardly less poetic.

CLAUSE XXV.
THERE is much talking and writing at the present time about
this famous Clause of the Education Act, some insisting that it
should be repealed, others as stoutly urging that it should be re-
tained. For the benefit of all those who have not the Act of Parlia-
ment at hand to refer to, we will here set out this much-debated
Clause at full length:—
“And be it further enacted that from and after the passing of this Act—an
event which may or may not be celebrated by dinners, fireworks, illumina-
tions, and other public rejoicings—any School Board, whether composed of
Denominational or Undenominational Members, or of six of one and half a
dozen of the other, or such other number as may have been assigned for its
constitution by the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education by public
advertisement in the London Gazette, may, if they think fit, after proſonged
discussion at several adjourned meetings interspersed with divisions, re-open-
ings of the question, and considerable excitement, from time to time proceed
to elect at any meeting composed of a legal quorum, and by the votes of at
least three-fifths of the Members then present, should there be more than one
Candidate for the appointment, a proper and suitable Person, at such salary
or wages as shall appear reasonable and sufficient, to clean, cleanse, wash,
scour, scrub, black lead, and polish the floors, forms, desks, and other furni-
ture and fittings, grates, fire-places, and stoves, in any room or rooms, cham-
ber or apartment, used as a Public School, and being under the control,
authority, and management of the said Board, without requiring from the
Person so appointed, as the necessary condition of her election, any declara-
tion, either oral or in writing, of her theological opinions, or of those of her
present or late husband, should she happen to be a married woman or
widow.”
Is it worth while to make all this fuss and stir about such a simple
matter?

RATHER TOO RICH.
IN, a report on the Adulteration Act, lately presented to the
Paddington Parish Vestry by their analyst, DR. HARDwicke, occurs
the somewhat surprising statement that:—
“With regard to the samples of milk brought to him officially, he found
one to contain an enormous quantity of cream—viz., thirty-five per cent.
having been added to the milk in order to deceive the analyst.”
If there is any kind of adulteration that a purchaser could be
reconciled to, it would certainly, one thinks, be the adulteration of
milk with cream. Indeed, by far the greater part of the milk that
is sold would, to the taste of most consumers, be considerably
improved by that particular adulteration. An excess of cream in
milk is generally regarded as º too much of a good thing; yet
it is, if not easy to see, quite possible to conjecture, how it may pay
rogues to * a sample of milk with cream “in order to
deceive the analyst.”

THE DIGNITY OF LABOUR.
ECENTLY_t has been said that, in
some of the Mining Districts,
the Colliers have betaken them-
selves to riding mounted on
their gallant steeds to the pit's
mouth. We shall soon, perhaps,
hear that these industrious,
hard-working fellows are keep-
ing their carriages as well as
their horses, if not their boxes
at the Opera, which is too remote, only, for that. The wages they receive
should H. the apprehension that any of them may, in the meanwhile,
verify the adage about setting a beggar on horseback.

A COURT OF ABLUTION.
A QUESTION now of many years' standing will, there is reason to expect, be
submitted to a legal tribunal. At the Court of Exchequer, on º last;
sittings in Banco before the LoRD CHIEF BARON, BARöNs Bºſweli, IGOTT,
and Pollock, according to the Law Reports, proceedings commenced with the
installation of-
“THE TUBMAN of THE Court.—MR. R. E. WEBstER, at the invitation of the LoRD
CHIEF BARON, took his seat as tubman of the Court.”
Few of the general º probably, are aware that the Court of Exchequer
has a tubman attached to it, and still fewer have any idea of the functions
performed by that officer. Ünder an impression that they are analogous to
those of either a bath-man or a laundress, some junior member of the Bar may
Fº feel called upon to make an application to the Barons of the Exchequer
to be allowed, in connection with the #. of their tubman, to ask them how
he is off for soap.

The Ministers ate, drank, and talked,

And mocked them, d la Barmecide,
With meats that, seeming fair,

establish a University of their own, to correspond, with differences,
to that of London. Its growing body will consist of the thirteen
English titular Bishops, including the Archbishop, with Monsignor
CAPEI, for first Rector, and His Holiness at the head of the concern.
This institution is designed to supply the Roman Catholic superior
classes with the learning which #. forbids them to acquire at
Oxford and Cambridge. The foundation thus prescribed by the
RoPE proves, perhaps more strongly than anything else has proyed;
that PIUs THE NINTH has the courage of his opinions. It is a bold
experiment; for its success, if answerable to its aims, will be more
undeniably miraculous than any picture or statue that ever winked:
whilst, should it fail, its failure will sorely discredit. Infallibility.
The Holy Father confides in the results of competition with Pro-
testantism in the field of learning and science; he expects that the
Papal Church, in its new University, will triumph by degrees. His
pluck is so high as to be regardless of any plucking which may be
sustainable in competitive examinations.

THE ". furnished Å. our Special Correspondents in all parts

Walden to South, Molton, from York to Yeovil—prove, beyond the
possibility of a doubt, that the election of “our Mayors” on the
ninth of this month was commenced and carried to a successful issue
with all that º and circumstance, that spirit and enthusiasm,

om of the Legislature, by a happy thought, purposely reserved to
brighten and spel the gloom º darkness º §.
In those municipalities where it has been the immemorial custom
to have fireworks in the market-place and bonfires on the surround-
ing hills, and to illuminate the Town-Hall, the Police-Station, and
other Public Buildings, the oldest inhabitant, on being questioned
with much tact and kindness, could not recollect any previous dis-
play of the same brilliancy and magnitude, except, perhaps, in the
year 1826, when the evening was remarkably fine ...F.
In different parts of England the flags floated from many an old
church tower, and ivied castle keep, and venerable guildhall; and
merry peals of bells, and merry groups of girls, combined with
public #. and an unusual consumption of excisable liquors,
convinced the passing stranger, and the commercial traveller that
the day was one of exceptional importance.
In those boroughs where long usage has associated this anni-
versary in the minds of the oldest burgess and the youngest appren-
tice with the º of a particular dish on the dinner-table, it
is gratifying to be able to record. that the continued prosperity of
the country was substantially indicated by the large increase in the
number of families who partook of roast goose and apple-sauce.
At Barnsley the Council combined two seemingly impossible
results—they re-elected the Mayor, and at the same time chose a
Newman. At Barnstaple it be May all the year round; at
York, March. Batley and Huddersfield are supplied with a Brooke;
Wisbeach is accommodated with a Ford; and Gravesend has a
Lake all to itself. There is a Narroway at Bideford, a Greenway
at Warwick, a Brownhill at Walsall, and a Ridge at Grantham;
Rhodes at Bradford, and a Walker at Liverpool. -
The new Mayors are not all selected from one class or, calling.
The interests of Newcastle-on-Tyne are cared for by a Potter, a
Turner is responsible for the demeanour of Northampton, a Masºn
has the charge of Stamford, and a Glover fits South Shields.
Arundel has ini a Duke, Ipswich a Chevalier, Birmingham a
Chamberlain, and Wallingford a Champion. -
The Mayor of Berwick is Young, the Mayor of Evesham is New
to his duties; but as they are both Aldermen, Berwick and Eve-
sham will probably not repent of their confidence. RyeW.
nently happy Rye, is again gladdened by, a.Meryon: ho does

There be a Hunt all through the winter again at Bath; and
Boston—is it famous for cricket?—sticks to its Bailes. There is
a Story connected with Lancaster, and we sincerely hºpe that
Harvey’s “Meditations” at Newark will not fail to be satisfactory
throughout his term of office. --- - - -
We trust we shall not be thought guilty of undue familiarity if,
once more taking the Loving Cup in both hands to drink to the
health and prosperity of “Our Mayors,” we call upon Gregory at
Dorchester, and Godfrey at Romsey, and James at Preston, to

THERE is a project—American—for keeping the Erie

Canal into a magnificent warm bath—tickets to residents
on the banks and their friends at reduced rates—he hopes
afterwards to be able to do something to make the North
Pole a little more comfortable; and in time, perhaps, to
raise the temperature of some of our highest mountains, so
as to put an end to glaciers, avalanches, perpetual snow,
and other trying accompaniments of an elevated position.
He has our warmest wishes for his success, and we shall
be glad to hear that he has managed to keep out of hot
water himself.
Appropriate.
According to the description given of MESSRs. SPIERs
AND POND's new Restauration, near Regent Circus, there
is “an entirety of counter length protected by a kind of
cored baldacchino richly dight in gold and colours.” Now
this cuts both ways for the parties who do and don’t
want to have a baldacchino up in St. Barnabas', Pimlico.
The spirited Proprietors of the above-mentioned refresh:
ment place have furnished the ecclesiastical Judge in
this case, if not with a precedent, at all events with a
Criterion to go by; though no doubt they would rather
he dropped into than went by their particular Crite-
r1011.
RESULTS OF • REFLEX ACTION.”
SUNDRY muscular movements, nearly, or quite, mechanical, can
be caused by an impression travelling along sensitive nerves from
without to within, and returning as an impulse from within out-
wards. This influx and efflux of nervous force our physiological
friends, call “reflex action.” . It, though transmitted to and from
the seat of sensation, appears to be in some cases unconnected, and
in others connected but slightly, with consciousness. ... In a lecture
Qu the Functions of the Brain, ſately delivered at St. George's Hall,
DR, CARPENTER adduced the following apt and striking illustration
of #. latter species of reflex action—that of which the consciousness
1s hazy:—
.“How purely automatic, even in man, those movements may be, which,
originally dependent on the will, have come to be habitual, is shown by their
continuance when the attention is entirely absorbed by an internal train of
º: the body of a philosopher, who is mentally working out some pro-
found question, ; carried j his accustomed track by the reflex
motion of his legs, which are guided through his visual sense, so that he
†. at his place of destination without any knowledge of what brought
ere.”
When the process of reflection goes on in the mind, and that of
reflex action, as above described, simultaneously with it in the body
and limbs of a peripatetic philosopher, the results of this double
working of his organisation, F. and corporeal, are sometimes
such as to interest the physiologist much less than the caricaturist
and the buffoon. , Arrived at the place of his destination on, his
legs, without any knowledge of the means that brought him thither,
the sage, who has been wal ºf absorbed in thought, or rather who
has unconsciously been walked along, by reflex, action, will exhibit
Fº at his lower extremities which will show that he has
een walking, for example, through, puddles. Reflex action may,
occasionally, have marched a profound thinker, whilst immersed in
thought, into the midst of a quagmire, and plunged him therein up
to his own middle. It does not always steer such an one clear of
stones and other similar obstacles, which, §: up a learned and
meditative Professor, as stumbling-blocks and rocks of offence, cause
him to fall, thereby bringing his nose in contact with the earth, and
impressing his countenance with the appearance Vulgarly styled
“gravel-rash,” which his friends ascribe to excess in intoxicating
liquors.
t is said that persons in a state of intoxication, lying under, a
table, will sometimes try to hold on to the floor with their hands.
Perhaps this effort is caused by reflex action. -
It does not appear that persons of the unenfranchised sex are
much subject to }. reflex action by which º are apt to
be impelled, and brought to grief. But, in the first place, none
except the very strong-minded are given to lose, themselves, in
thought, and, in the next, still fewer are accustomed to walk when
they can possibly ride.
A case of reflex action sometimes comes perhaps before a Court
of Justice. An impression made on the retina by a watch-chain is
conveyed through the optic nerve to the brain ºr spinal cord, and
thence transmitted to the muscles of the arm and the fingers' ends,
causing them to and tug the chain, and thus abstract a watch
from a pocket. #. abstraction, in two senses, would be combined
with reflex action. This combination might be pleaded on behalf of
a philosopher, but the plea of reflex action in an abstracted mood as
an excuse for abstraction of property, would hardly availan ordi-
nary prig.
The Conservative School.
IN his speech at the Glasgow banquet MR. DISRAELI made grace-
ful reference to his position as the Conservative Leader. On a
festive occasion celebrating his installation as “the Lord Rector of
a famous seat of learning,” he might opportunely, and therefore,
without appearing to extol himself in any degree above measure,
have at least hinted at the services which he has rendered his Party
in the capacity of their Educator.

OCCASIONAL HAPPY THOUGHTS.
oLL0A' Winter’s getting on.
Must get this horse, or
where’s º exercise?
Can't do my little exercise
without a horse; but
fancy trying to ão an
exercise on a horse!—sa
º- a German exercise!
tº should soon find I had
tº committed cin Śrºtium, and
* I from my ºftrº should
** have to himuntergeşem.
= . Dislike the German
character—I mean charac-
ters of the German Al-
phabet. It looks like a
sort of nutcracker lan-
º guage.
\ . Happy Thought.—Kind
of language the Welsh
*† talk in Flintshire.
Talking of languages,
everyone, says Italian is
so easy, because everyone
has learnt Latin. But
Italian would be very
much easier if the Italians
had only stuck to their
- - - Latin, and not tried to
better it. ... Don't tell me that “giorno” is in anyway suggested by
‘... dies.” There's an i in both words, but, for the matter of that,
there’s an eye in a needle.
Happy *::::::: suddenly occurs to me that I’ve invented
a proverb. “He has an eye, and so has a needle,” must be a
companion proverb to “He has a head, and so has a pin.” As some
one said (forget who, but look him up), “Let who will make the
nation's songs, I'll do the proverbs.”
. This suggests rules for making a nation. First, begin with
inventing a set of proverbs. Then— I don't quite see the next
step at present; but to anyone who wants to start a new nation
(and there must be some wanted by this time) it's well worth con-
sideration.
These ideas occur to me while I am on my road to call on CLUMBER,
the flyman, about that horse he's got, which, I’ve heard from
Spokes, the carri builder, or carriage-mender (I think he must
be a carriage-mender, as I’ve often seen him at work mending a
carriage, but never caught him building one), tells me, is, in hi
(SEQRER's) opinion, “Just the verything to suit me.”
Must be on my guard in dealing with anyone about a horse.
Can't get out of my head the rhyme that first occurred to me when
I thought of calling on CLUMBER, the flyman. As I must get it out
ºf my head at sometime or other, so as to allow the brain free action
for other subjects (Note.—Most important to read up DR. CARPEN-
TEB's Lectures on Brain. I think I see something new for Typical
Developments, Vol. II., Thirteenth Edition, revised, *::::::: and
with considerable additions, under “B” for Brain), I put it into my
pocket-book thus:—
“Simple SIMON
Met a flyman
coming through the gorse,
aid Simple Snrox
To the Flyman,
‘How about that horse?’”
This verse might lead on to a story. Perhaps this is the way most
poetry is commenced. If so, is this an inspiration, or not? not
what? Write, and ask TENNYson. y the way, d propos of
national songs and proverbs, I don’t think, on reflection, that when
I was once starting in the latter line as roverb-maker, I would
ever say to anyone else, “Let who will e the songs, I’ll do the
proverbs;” because, why shouldn't I do both? º: pay better
than Proverbs...Get SANTLEY to sing one Song, and the fortune of
composer, versifier, and publisher is made. But there’s nothing to
be got out of some one's delivering a Proverb. There may be, as the
entrepreneurs ; “money on it,” but I don't see it, at present.
Happy Thought.--To ask SpokER something more about CLUM-
BER's horse. SpokER as a carriage-builder (or mender) must know
something about horses. If he doesn’t, he looks like it. There’s
something about SpokER's hat, which he always wears, and his
trousers that suggests to my mind a knowledge of horseflesh.
While at work the line where his upper half terminates is clearly
defined by apron-strings round his waist: his costume being long
apron, no coat, and very well brushed hat, and the ends of his
sporting trousers seen below, so that when he steps into the road
to seeme, with a pen behind his ear and an order-book in his hand,
the idea occurs to me that he represents a sort of out-of-door grocer
who's had a successful bet on the Derby. A vague description,
but if you can imagine somebody, in the above-mentioned costume,
ready at any moment to give you long odds, against anything, in
currants or preserved ginger, and book it at once, there’s SpokER
down to the ground: I mean, in appearance.
Happy Thought.—Riddle for SpokER; to put him in a good

stand it: and clearly thinks I’m laughing at him. I explain that
I mean Village. He is evidently still of opinion that I'm only trying
to get out of it, after deeply wounding his feelings. I must try and
restore his º: by hinting that I shall soon be in want of a large
carriage. At this he brightens up. I go largely into the subject of
coaches and carriages, and I feel I've made SpokER happy for the
rest of the day. I can imagine the way in which he § rub his
hands when he goes in to dinner (all the little SpokERs round the
table, and MRs. SpokeR at the head), and say, “Ah! I think I’m
in for a good thing now. Mr. So-and-So wants two or three new
carriages, and has come to me to ask about them. Thank you, my
dear, yes, I will take a little of that beef, it looks capital.”
SpokER strongly recommends CLUMBER's horse, in fact, if SpokER
himself were in want of such a thing, CLUMBER's is what he should
get. “What does CLUMBER want for him?” I ask. Ah, that
Spoker doesn't know; in fact he doesn't quite know whether MR.
CLUMBER intends selling him or not. “Here,” says SpokER, Point:
ing to a dog-cart, “is the trap he was drove in yesterday—it’s just
the sort o' thing for him, and did ten miles in half an , easy.
I’ll see if MR. CLUMBER's in, if you like, Sir?”
Yes. Thank you. SpokER goes round the corner. I follow.
Perhaps it will be as well not to let SpokER and CLUMBER be too
long together before Ijoin them. Really, horse-buying does make
me very suspicious.
CLUMBER, the flyman, is a square-built, trim-whis very
respectable, yet unmistakably horsey-looking man, in a
#. suit, presenting a compound of a Quaker, a well-to-do
armer, and a superior Hansom-cab driver, all in one. He has a
sharp eye, and so quick a way of constantly turning his head from
one side to the other, without moving his body, that it appears as if
he were, as a coachman, perpetually hearing the cry of “Whip
behind!” and was an adept in flicking a boy neatly on the spokes.
Having time, I look CLUMBER all over. Considering his low-
crowned hat, very much turned up at the brim, his stuff gaiters,
and the preponderance of the respectable Quaker and farmer ele-
ments over that of the Hansom cabman, I begin to think that he
might stand for an ideal portrait of a Rural Dean.
Happy Thought.—Apart from CLUMBER, what a charming subject
for a picture! One can see it, at once, in the Academy List for
next year, “No. 299. “A Rural Dean.” by MILLAIs.” There he'd
be reclining in a meadow, on freshly-made sweet hay: lambkins,
with blue ribbon, frisking by his side: flageolet in his right hand:
garlands and flowers all about him anyhow : an overturned bowl of
syllabub on the short-cropped grass: and one of his shoes off, with
a garter strap loose, showing the cotton work, and pattern (a great
chance for an artist) of the sº Laughing girls, with roses
and posies, might be seen in the distance dancing towards him,
accompanied by boy—choristers in white lices, and there should
be a . (as a background) among the old rook-inhabited trees,
so as not to lose sight of the ecclesiastical character au fond.
I freely make a present of this beautiful idea to any R.A., or to
every one of them, for they could all treat it from their different
points of view. For instance:–

RENDEZVOUS FOR HOME-RULERS.
ENIANISM made late
announcement that
ºld. “Amnesty De-

which preparations
were “being made
on a most extensive
scale,” would come
off at Dublin on the
following Sunday
the anniversary *}
the execution of
ALLEN, LARKIN, and
O’BRIEN, who were
hanged at Manches-
ter, for the murder
of SERGEANT BRETT.
The public were in-
formed that:-
“It is understood that MR. BUTT will address an enormous assemblage of
people in a field adjoining the cemetery, where memorials have been erected
to the memory of the executed men.”
Unless MR. BUTT has disappointed the friends of Home Rule, he
has, doubtless, pointed out to “an enormous assemblage” of Irish-
men the enormity of seeking the dismemberment of the British
Empire by the murder of policemen. No fitter spot could have been
selected for an harangue to that truly patriotic purport than one
adjoining the cemetery “where memorials have been erected to the
memory of the executed men” above-named. Those criminals were
interred within the precincts of a prison; and, in these days, there
remain standing, to answer the purpose of a Reformer's Tree, no
º upon which, as in the days of our ancestors, murderers have
een hanged in chains.

Thought on, HoRSEBACK.—We none of us like to lose the pro-
ficiency to which we may have attained in any art, accomplishment,
pastime, or pursuit, least of all to fall off in riding.
SOCIAL STATISTICS.
Of the Tourists who this autumn have been travelling in Switzer-
land, sixty-six per cent. have purchased Alpenstocks with branded
names of mountains they have never dared to dream of attempting
to ascend: thirty-three per cent. have joked about the Rhine having
run into the rhino: , and only twelve, per cent. have sensibly
abstained in their letters to their friends from making any com-
ments on the cooking or the scenery.
. It is feared that out of nearly half a million of *...*. who
indulge still in the luxury of reading novels when in bed, only one
in every thousand is provided with a safetylamp, in order to prevent
. curtains catching fire in case by any accident she chance to fall
asleep.
Since the recent rise in coal more than twenty thousand rats have
been purchased every month by the Pitmen of Northumberland for
the use and recreation of their favourite bullpups.
.No fewer than eight hundred and ninety-seven Hair-pins were
picked up by the broomsmen at the Crystal Palace at the close of
the last Saturday concert and promenade. This, we learn, exceeds
by as many as one hundred and eleven the number found upon the
corresponding Saturday last year.
A professional Diner-out in extensive West End practice estimates
that at forty-seven out of every fifty dinner parties the saddle of
mutton is served round without any currant jelly, and that at
nineteen out of twenty the vegetables are either cold and underdone
or else boiled into a pulp. He calculates, moreover, that at only
one house out of eighty, even though the claret has been worth at
least a guinea a bottle, can he rely on getting a º cigar.
The young Ladies of sentiment, who keep up the old practice of
pestering their friends to scribble nonsense in their albums, amount,
it is believed, in Middlesex alone, to thirteen thousand and sixteen.
It has been calculated lately, by a careful statistician, that the
Servants without followers, who reside in London, have increased in
number lately, and may be estimated now at nearly one percent.
The vagrant Musicians, who infest the quiet streets of the Metro-
polis, now earn, upon the average, a halfpenny an hour more than
in the corresponding quarter of last year.
JOKES WITH PRAYERS.
OUR Ritualistic contemporary, the Church Herald, contains the
following edifying anecdote, to which it has been pleased to prefix
the very last heading we should have thought applicable :-
“‘HAPPY THought.”—On Sunday evening a Clergyman at the West
End, whose name we would record if we knew it, as that of a staunch Tory,
after announcing that “the prayers of the Church were desired on behalf of a
sick person,’ commenced the appointed Prayer for the present Parliament.
We heard it ourselves.”
And if we knew the name of the parson who played this antic in
the reading-desk, we also would record it, with a hint that the
BISHop of LoNDoN might reasonably object to “larks” with the
Church Service. Does the man know what a prayer means, and to
Whom it is addressed ? Does he think that a bad joke ought to be
let off during Divine Service P.We feel charitably inclined to try to
believe that there is some mistake. That such an accident, if it
were one, or that such a levity should delight a Ritualist, is natural
enough. The sort of creature who would be horrified if a few
crumbs of bread had fallen on the floor near the Table, and been
left for the church mice, is naturally incapable of real reverence,
and would see “fun” in what was (if designed, which, again we
say, we are reluctant to believe) the most indecent thing we have
heard of for many a day of Ritualistic idiotcy.
Civic Benevolence.
THE pleasures of the Lord Mayor's Dinner are not confined to
Guildhall. Neither do its benefits end with the intercourse of the
City and the Cabinet. The poor as well as the rich will have an
agreeable recollection this year of the festivities of the Ninth of
§. A kind thought has led the Banquet Committee to for-
ward “a large quantity of turtle-soup and some choice fruit for the
use of the patients of the London and St. Bartholomew's Hospitals.”
One of the best City Feasts on record.
APPROPRIATE PEIRASES.
THE business of a Soldier is called the Profession of Arms, and
that of a Dancer might be styled the Profession of #: only the
latter description, if applicable, to the Ballet, considered as an
Tºyment might perhaps, with equal justice, be applied to the
ul'I.

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CONTRAST.
Since our Picture of the Fair Lady at the Furniture Sale, published three weeks ago, a great change has taken place for the better.
Auction Rooms, where mirrors are sold, are now exclusively haunted by fair Ladies (led there possibly by some vague hope of meeting
Mr. Punch, and being immortalised by his discreet and not unflattering pencil).
On the other hand, those less ornamental beings, who have hitherto been the principal frequenters of such places, have altogether vanished
from the scene—with the exception, however, of one, whose manners, obliging, yet unobtrusive, and polite, without obsequiousness, lead one
to the conviction that he cannot be
cunningly assumed disguise.
what he seems, and that his apparent calling and unmistakeably Semitic aspect are part and parcel of some
GREEK AT GLASG0W.
“Cassius. Did CICERo say anything?
“Casea. Ay, he spoke Greek.
* Cassius. To what effect 2
“Casca. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you in the face again,
but those who understood him smiled at one another, and shook their heads;
but, formine own part, it was Greek to me.”—Julius Cæsar, Act i., Sc. 2.
THE Times gave Lord Rector DISRAELI's concluding quotation in
its original Greek. Most of our other contemporaries translated it.
#. one hits a happy medium, and gives us Greek in English,
thus:- -
“Egú men oun, kai tauta. kaita pant’ aei,
Phaskoim', an anthropoisi mechanãn theous.
Otó de métad' estinen gnome phila,
Keinos tekeina stergetö, kagö tade.”
It really looks very pretty in our type, and it is to be hoped that
no pedant will object to this Hamiltonian process. We subjoin the
translation in English:-
“These things and all things at all times I say,
My faith is come straight from the gods to men;
wº. deems other form of doctrine true,
He has his creed, let me adhere to mine.”
Now may we, in all good humour (for the brilliant orator was at
his best, and could excite no feeling but that of admiration), offer
another version:—
“This thing once again into language I shape,
Belief in oneself is my faith and evangel:
If any man likes to go in for the #.
He can. I prefer taking side with the Angel.”
EXIT HEENAN.
[From America has come news of the death of HEENAN. An eminent
| sporting Nobleman has been inspired to write the hero's epitaph, and to send
it to Punch. The latter can hardly help printing it, and would exceedingly
like to know who gave his Lordship the names of the Virgilian heroes.]
HERE HEENAN lies, the stalwart son of Troy,
But better known as the “Benicia Boy.”
With him, in '60, bold ToM SAYERs fought—
The battle ended as it didn't ought.
HEENAN was beaten blind, and ToM, instead
Of his maimed right, took blows upon his head.
Then Peelers came. . Each champion got a belt;
Which course unsatisfactory was felt.
Now both are gone; (so's MENKEN, HEENAN's wife),
Let's hope to meet where there is no more strife.
But this we do say, both was noble fellows,
As good as WIRGIL's Dares and Entellus.
Who Can They Be?
“THE LoRINERs' Coxſpany.—A livery dinner of this ancient guild, which
existed as a mystery in 1245, was held at the London Tavern yesterday.”
WHAT is a Loriner? Is he to be found in the Post-Office Direc-
tory? Does he *. Income-tax and serve on Juries? Has he views
| about Education Boards and Epping Forest inclosures? Does he
|ever, become, Lord Mayor? Give the reins to your imagination,
|Reader, and try and fancy what a Loriner is. You will, probably,
| end by thinking that what was “a mystery in 1245” is quite as
much a mystery in 1873.

SIR
I Had had my eye on the Princess's advertisement for some
weeks past, and so, when Griselda did appear, there was I, at the
front door, representing You, and singing gaily—
§ ROUSBY, then,
My merry, merry man,
For ’tis your opening day.
And so it was, as far as the new piece was concerned. Being in
lyric vein, let me proceed:
And let me say
That clever Miss BRADDON
Has written a play,
And not a bad 'un.
That’s rhyme and reason... There are some fine lines in Griselda,
quite as ſº as any one of the above taken separately. Seriously,
most of the writing is very good, so much so that I was sorry to hear
how a couplet was lugged in to be impatiently delivered by Griselda
(who ought to have been so patient, but wasn't), quite out of cha-
racter with Lady Grizzle's character, and which could have been
§ intended as a trap for the applause of the happy gods in the
Gallery. MR. Roushy came out very strong in the §. love-
making scene, where the entrance of MR. WILLIAM RIGNOLD, in full
armour, from the Lord Mayor's Show of the period, is an admirable
dramatic situation most artistically led up to. ...MR. Rousby, in
voice and manner, forcibly reminded §. Representative of
CHARLEs KEAN on this same stage. -

paniment, out of the most dilapidate instrument ever permitted in
a nobleman's private stringed band. But this is a detail, and I dare
say “the harp that once” was all wrong is now all the other thing.
I’ve to say at 1. is, that I would MISS BRADDoN had got
hold of a better subject, and that Griselda is no more the patient
Grizzle of my early childhood than You, Sir, are what I am–

REGULATIONS FOR SCHOOL-BOARD ELECTIONS.
EveRY Ratepayer (including gas and water) is entitled to as many
votes as there are members to be returned; and these he may dis-
tribute amongst the candidates who have been least troublesome
to him with their cards and circulars, or give them all to one—o
none.
The Election will be by ballot—one black ball to exclude.
The voting is cumulative, that is to say, there will be a heap o
people at the polling-booth.
On entering and leaving the booth, the Act requires the Ratepayel
to make a respectful inclination to the Returning Officer (who is no
necessarily a naval or military man), or his deputy; but there mus
be no attempt to draw the officer into conversation about the state
of the weather or the poll. -
When the Ratepayer intends to vote for a Lady-candidate (which,
we trust, he will have the sense to do wherever he has the oppor-
tunity), he must remove his hat while he fills up his paper.
Women are entitled to vote at School-Board Elections, and, as a
rule, will pay some attention to their personal appearance, particu-
larly to the hair, before i. come to the poll.
§. Ratepayer is to divulge how he has voted, except (if he is a
married man) to his wife, and only then under a solemn pledge or
her part not to disclose the secret to MRs. PRIDLE or the MIss
RUMMAGES.
As a fitting preparation for the responsible duty he is about to
discharge, every Ratepayer is recommended, before he leaves home
on the morning of i. election, either to read a chapter in the
History of England since the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, or to commit
to memory the dates of the more remarkable battles in the Seven
Years' War. This, however, is not º,
Suitable vehicles for the conveyance of the Ratepayer to the poll
(at his own expense) will be provided by the different cab-pro-
prietors and livery-stable keepers.
The poll will close at 8 P.M., and the result will be transmitted by
the electric wire to India, America, Australia, the Cape, &c., wit
as little delay as possible. -
Many Happy Returns of the Day.

spirit of his youth. Brayvo, codingsby You will be young ir

To Britain's Commons, and the world
Of London far and wide,
Stops—and the town that marked the
hush -
Of his deep voice with pain,
Is glad to hear 'tis but a halt;
To clean his “going train.”

But ask of clocks the hour, -

Up there, in BARRY's Tower... .
And think, if “going trains” in air
As, upon earth, be rash, ...

Big Ben's not gone to smash!
But with more wonder still we learn
That, in the month gone by,
A face of such ideal truth.
Big Ben has shown on high,
That the accumulated slips
Which in his blackbook show,
On no day of the thirty days
Beyond a second go!

Thus with the tide of time,
Long may'st thou to the Commons set

That England, both of House below -
And Clock above, may say,
'Tis no vain boast that to the world
She shows the time of day!
May headlong Wits, that on the seats
Under that Clock may show,
Learn by its even beat above
To tune hot brains below.
And never hold up hands, unless
The voice of truth to swell;
Nor strike, except at the right hour,
And then strike strokes that tell.

To House's credit set?
Since the month thus from error free
Was when no House was met.

A signal lamp doth rear; -
This shines but while the Čommons sit,
That tells time all the year.

With intermittent heat;

teadily on his beat.
Let other Legislatures take
The shifting Light for i. ;
But England, may'st thou keep the Clock
For symbol, still, of thine.

Though measured 'tis and slow—
Rather than in the flashing light
That shifts 'twixt gloom and glow.

distribution of blankets and coals will then supply the want of news.
Benevolence and Forethought will resolve themselves into a Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to provide the funds needful for those
purposes out of the personal Exchequer. The cases, however, in
which a surplus can be found available are limited. Enormous
opulence is in general, balanced by corresponding expenditure,
necessitated by ostentation, the condition of credit in business, or
at least of position in society. Professional persons, and small pro-
rietors, have mostly quite enough to do to pay their bills at
§º and too many of them consider that they already bear
more than their share of the burdens of their poorer neighbours, and
of their richer too, in paying income-tax. Unable to provide suffi-
ciently for their own families, or against their own misfortune,
they cannot be reasonably expected to lay by anything whatever
for the rainy day of other people. Besides, the mite of the widow
blesses those who give very considerably more than it does those that
take it; and, effectually to feed the hungry and clothe the naked,
the deed must equal the will.
The relief of the destitute will naturally devolve on those who
can best afford it—the .*. working people. Through a series
of strikes they have been blessed with a superabundance of means,
illustrated by the fact that oysters are half-a-crown a dozen. Their
luxury is unlimited by º of splendour. As they drank
us out of the Alabama difficulty, so, it is to be hoped, they will
drink us out of the Ashantee trouble. But, in the ºni, by
the exercise of moderation in drinking for a few weeks, they will be
enabled to spare quite as much money as may be requisite to supply
all the necessities of their own order. Effectually to succour }.
who are stricken with age and poverty, or struck down by disease
* want of work, none are so truly competent as the Striking
Plasses. -
At St. James's Hall.
DR, HANs Won Bülow has made a decided hit on the piano.
This is not a Thumper: nor is he. So deftly does he manage the
keys and the pedals, that, dropping the Won, the Professor should
be named HANs and Feet BöLow, or HANs Above and Feet BüLow.
In the absence of MADAME ARABELLA GoDDARD (now enchanting the
Antipodes) it is most gratifying to hear so admirable a performance
as is that of DR, HANS v. BöLow. So, able an interpreter is he of
the Great Musical Abbé's pieces, that in England he might head one
part of his programme with the adopted Shakespearian motto,
“Liszt, Liszt, Oh Liszt l” And we suggest that when he wants
an epitaph—some hundred years hence, or more—it should be—
“Faithful Bülow he did his duty,
But now he's gone aloft."
The Serenade of the Storm.
How sweet to hear, as you lie snug in bed,
The wind howl outside, and the drifting rain,
Whilst you have your own roof above your head,
Dashed by the §. against your casement's pane.
So should I, . in some fat sinecure,
Which clamour by no rage could wrest away,
Peruse, at breakfast, with enjoyment pure,
The papers railing on me every day.
Change for a Sovereign.
The KING of ITALY declares that Rome is free from Papal rule,
although the Sovereign Pontiff still contrives to live in it. He takes
the liberty to hint that the liberty enjoyed there is greater than it
used to be, and that he will not permit the priests to try to lessen it.
The KING OF ITALY for one, º Mr. Punch may add, the King of
Fleet Street for another, clearly differ from the dictum that—
“Nusquam libertas gratior exstat
Quam sub rege PIo.”
Beware the Bailiffs
MACMAHON has seven years' lease.
Marshal, be your tenure peace.
So shall you and France no Men
In Possession see again.

MR. Forsyth's victory over one Railway Company, which has
been compelled to pay the expenses he incurred through the said
Company's not conveying him according to contract, and the
menacing notice which the Board of Trade has given to all the
Companies, touching Railway Accidents, have aroused the haughty
Directors to a sense of the situation. An extraordinary meeting of
the authorities is about to be held, and we understand that it will
be proposed, that an Oath, in about the terms following, shall be
administered by the ticket-clerks to all intending passengers, after
they have paid their money, and before the tickets are flung at them.
In the event of refusal to take the Oath, the money is to be de-
tained, and paid over to the “Testimonials Fund.”:—

FROM the Autobiography of the late JoHN STUART MILL it appears
that his father, JAMEs STUART MILL, taught him Greek when a child
of tender years, and crammed him besides with all manner of know-
ledges. the two MILLs the elder one seems the more worthy of
the name, from the prodigious grinding with which he exercised his
son's genius. MILL Senior was the grinder; MILL Junior the
ground. When MRs. MILL presented her spouse with an heir, she

THE KING OF FRANCE.
HEALTH and Salutation to MAGENTA THE FIRST, King of France!
The “cool old Sworder” has won the game, and reigns more abso-
lutely than HENRY CINQ ever hoped to do. . Homage to the Sabre!
We have no doubt that he will be a very good King, but the French
Assembly has shown a generous and trustful spirit in taking him
without any conditions whatever. A “King,” as MR. CARLYLE has
informed us, is a man who “can Do,” and His Majesty KING
MAGENTA has, shown his energy and ability in the battle-field.
When we read of the blind fury and frantic scenes which have
marked the change of Government, and when we see how the little
majority of ten has gone up to sixty-eight, nothing succeeding
like success, we feel a profound contempt for our ancestors and their
cautious, cowardly, deliberate method of transferring authority at
the Revolution. The Assembly has gone more bravely into action,
and we only hope that its work will last as long as that of our
ancestors, with their slavish adherence to precedent, and their
exaction of Royal guarantees. Wire le Roi MAGENTA I
An Intoxicating Liquor.
MR. WALTER BURTON, lately an Officer of Her Majesty's Customs,
states, in a letter to the Times, that the average strength of Sherry,
as imported and passed into consumption, is not less than from
thirty-seven to fifty per cent. of proof spirit. So spirituous a liquor
as this should be called, not Sherry, but Sherry-brandy.

PROOF OF PROSPERITY.
At a meeting of the Cardiff Board of Guardians, on Saturday last week, a
remarkable circumstance came under consideration. It was that of a revolt in
the workhouse, which had occurred on the day before among the female paupers.
This outbreak was provoked by the retention in the workhouse, dietary of
Australian meat, notwithstanding the disapproval of it, when first introduced
;...º.º.º.º.º.º.º.º.º. had
induced the Guardians to try it themselves; an experiment which proved it
to be, in fact, exceedingly palatable. So, therefore, says a contemporary:—
“The Guardians resolved to continue its use, but their decision resulted in a novel kind
of outbreak_among the more rebellious paupers. On Friday morning, when the nurse
entered the Lock Hospital for the E." p giving the inmates their breakfast, she was
assailed with a shower of spoons, bread, and other missiles. The Master was sent for,
and order was temporarily restored. Subsequently, however, seven of the women jumped
out of the window, got into the garden, and conducted themselves like lunatics, until the
police, were sent for. They were taken before the bench, and sentenced to twenty-one
days' imprisonment.”
The dietary which these ladies will have experienced by the end of their
three weeks will probably have left them with such an appetite that they
will be ready, to devour Australian meat eagerly, as much so as they could
if they were the daughters of clergymen, solicitors, medical men, or clerks in
the Civil Service. But this by the way. It is to be remarked that the objection
to eat Australian meat was not confined to a section of the inmates of Cardiff
Workhouse. They, those who, actually mutinied, were indeed the more
rebellious of the paupers; but all were more or less rebellious. The whole of
them indignantly objected to eat Australian meat. And, no doubt, how
jº. Had they not, probably, most of them, been accustomed to eat
ar butcher's meat, and that º or four times a day? Did they not
belong to the class whose consumption of it has raised it to its present
prices? Whilst they were in the receipt of high wages were they not accus-
tomed to eat their fill of it, regardless of expense, or the expediency of
making any provision for the future? And, now that they have come to want,
are they not very naturally repugnant to the idea of food which they imagine
inferior to that they have been used to? We cannot wonder that paupers at
Cardiff, or anywhere else, should turn up their noses at Aºtº. meat;
we should . that they do, though glad enough
to eat it ourselves: their contempt for it is a gratifying
proof, of the general prosperity of this great country
and the progressively increasing standard of comfort and
luxury amongst the industrious classes.
AMANTIUM IRAE.
(oN A. LATE BATTLE.)
See the Law Report “ Gilbert (Author of “The Wicked
World’) v. Enoch (Publisher of “Pall Mall Ga-
zette'),” in the Common Pleas.
PALL MALL attacked The Wicked World
The Wicked World arraigned Pailifah,
And in the Court of Common Pleas
To legal loggerheads they fell.
Seeing how much this Wicked World
To Pall Mall's rich purveying owes,
For newest mots and É. squibs,
And all that in Club channels flows,
'Twixt two such natural allies
This sudden internecine jar,
How furious soe'er its wrath,
Must take the form of civil war.
So, HENRY JAMEs, with polished sword,
Stood champion of The Wicked World,
While KARSLAKE's spear as smooth as sharp
Home in Pall Mall's defence was hurled.
With such a civil war, no doubt,
A civil end most fitly squared;
And so they that the Kriegspiel judged,
Drawn battle, not drawn i. declared.
And thus on London's listening ears
Serene the all-round judgment fell,
“Innocent is the Wicked World,
Innocent, also, is Pall Mall !”
This soothing syrup from the twelve
Relief on smarts and sores bestowed;
And to the Common Pleas, for once,
We that uncommon pleasure owed.
Then, though the judgment give to him
damages not e'en a farden,
Let it vexed GILBERT satisfy,
While ENOCH owns 'tis not an 'ard 'un;
And, led by JAMEs's gentle hand,
And KARSLAKE, pattern of his sex,
To better understanding come,
And fall on one another's necks!
Lie down, with journalistic lamb,
Dramatic lion, in communion,-
Included, for all future time,
In a harmonious “Gilbert Union.”*

organisation, and its working, see the Poor-Law Reports.

A Good Test.
A RECENT visitor to Oxford, with statistical tastes,
desirous of ascertaining to what extent the three great
parties in the Church were respectively represented in
that University, drew his own conclusions, as he walked
through the streets, from the fact that, while he could
see “the High” and “the Broad,” he could nowhere
find “the Low.”

T
THE JOVIAL VEGETARIANS.
oRk of the dullest kind must be a
Teetotal feast, unless there be a
little harmony to enliven the
proceedings. There cannot be
much jollity in making speeches
over tea, or drinking toasts in
toast-and-water. Public dinners,
as a rule, are sadly dismal merry
meetings, but how mournful the
must be when abstinence enforce
is added to publicity l Nor, we
fancy, can a banquet whereat meats are all ºl. be a pleasant
sort of gathering. One cannot well imagine people making me
over cabbages and carrots. A pleasant song or two would very muc
increase the chances of conviviality, and so, by way of illustration
of the sort of thing we mean, we beg to recommend the following as
a drinking song to cheer our jovial Wegetarians:–
AIR-"A Bumper of Burgundy fill, fill for me.”
A peck of potatoes go peel, peel for me,
A few guests I’ve invited to dine,
Rare relish for carrots and turnips have we,
And good cabbage we seldom decline.
Carnivorous diners their venison may boast,
And may brag of their beef and their mutton.
But give me asparagus served upon toast,
And for juicy green peas I’m a glutton 1
The cabbages and carrots would surely taste the sweeterif a cheer-
ful stave like this enlivened their consumption. And pray why
should not a song like the following be sung to cheer the cook to do
her best whenever a Vegetarian banquet is in prospect?—
AIR-" Filla Bumper Fair.”
Fill the saucepan fair,
Friends are asked to dinner,
Shred the beans with care,
Slice the carrots thinner.
Mash the turnips well,
Cream improves their flavour;
How nice yon pea-soup's smell!
How dainty is its savour!
Chorus. Fill the saucepan fair, &c.
Celery you have bought,
Clearly you have reason,
'Grass I would have sought,
But 'tis not now in season.
Cabbage?—by all means,
russels sprouts we'll give too:
Men who live on greens
A green old age may live to!
- Chorus. #ill the saucepan fair, &c.
Sweet is the seakale,
Stew it slightly quicker,
Draw us Adam's ale,
'Tis the best of liquor.
Potatoes please to steam,
For every one a plateful;
And prithee do not dream
The guests will not be grateful.
Chorus. Fill the saucepan fair, &c.
Now for the bouquet
Cut a cauliflower,
Sweet as new-mown hay
Sprinkled with a shower.
Then with cheerful smile
Go and mix the salad:
I at ease the while
May warble you a ballad. -
Chorus. Fill the saucepan fair, &c.
A dish of parsnips, too,
May make the board more festive,
Although there may be few
Who find the root digestive.
WHY EDUCATE GIRLS 2

ANYTHING unpractical is shocking to me. I cannot see the
sense of this movement for the higher education of women. Our
object is to get married. To attain that object we must make our-

ear.
ScexE—Dinner. A large Party.
Edwin has been introduced to ANGELINA within the last ten minutes,
and has taken her down. They sit.
Edwin. You have plenty of room, I hope. (Sotto roce.) We are
rather closely packed.
Angelina. Plenty, thanks. [They take up the menu.
Edwin. I think my picture is prettier than yours.
Angelina. Perhaps it is. I don't know. This is a dear little fat
child with the roses. - - -
Edwin. Nothing to compare to my fat child swinging. O, don't

Angelina. Only sometimes. - - -
Edwin. A fine clear soup is the best possible beginning of a
dinner. . Anything heavy is simply a barbarism—that is, unless
one’s going in for a turtle dinner.
Angelina. I have tasted turtle-soup, and I suppose I have no
taste, for I really do not like it. -
Edwin. It is an acquired taste, like that for olives, virtue, and
children, but it is soon gained.
Angelina. O, but I love children.
Edwin. Many little brothers and sisters?
Angelina. Only two brothers.
Edwin. Awful little bores to you, I suppose?
Angelina. No, indeed. They behave very well, and I am very
fond of them.
Edwin. Ah!

are :
Edwin. Yes; and they are put low—no ridiculous épergne, or
anything to shut us out from our opposite neighbours. This salmon
with the Hollandaise sauce is excellent. Do not pass it.
Angelina. See how docile I am.
Edwin. Most amiable trait. Seen IRWING in Richelieu ?

Edwin. I like it very much—immense deal of go about it.
Governor, and other old fogies who have seen MACREADY, won’t
have it at any price; but then the Governor says he used to be in-
sulted for praising MACREADY to people who remembered KEAN, and
so on. I recommend the rol-au-rent.
Angelina. Ah! but I like quenelles.
Edwin. Docility has limits.
Angelina. Certainly. Perhaps it is your theory that Woman
should be a slave.
Edwin. It is, most decidedly; but I seldom ventilate it.
Angelina. I shall remember. Were you on the Continent this
Autumn 2
Edwin. Was I?, Let me see, O yes, I went to Vienna—that’s
on the Continent, isn't it?
Scotland, and had horrid weather.
Angelina. I think it always rains in Scotland.

As methinks it will be, if paid carelessly out,
To get CoFFEE upset and some nasty grounds wasted.
Don't let red-tape triumph, in sense's despite;
Öust General Routine: that old genius-upsetter;
And we haven't a doubt that our Wolseley in fight,
Will turn out a WELLESLEY, to all but the letter.
He has stores in abundance on shore—or at sea—
Not yet past the chances of troopships and packets;
And, in absence of red-coats, his best trust must
In a few—would he'd more—of brave British blue-jackets.
Of advisers at home he has more than enough,
And of critics in newspaper-columns and clubs;
And—as many cooks' broth, to a proverb, 's sad stuff–
It won't be their fault if the ' #: he drubs.
In short, he has all things a General should have,
And #. many things which a General should not;
But, while rubbish in tons we sent over the wave,
One trifle—an army—we somehow forgot.
In our deep penny wisdom, and horror of waste,
We shipped off the General minus his men,
So that if in a fix he should find himself placed, -
He might merely lose time writing home back again.
But if we have kept back the red-coats awhile,
Till the Fantees have been undeniably whipped,
En revanche, railway sleepers and rails by the mile,
In advance both of General and troops we have shipped.
So SIR GARNET, at sweet Cape Coast Castle arrived—
"Mid fever and Fantees and flounders and fuss,
Finds the rails he don't want on the beach snugly hived,
And to whistle is left for the red-coats he does.
We're a practical people—that truth’s rooted deep—
And the work of our practical War Office wights,
Is to pile all the blunders they can in a heap,
And then ask our Gen'rals to set them to-rights.

Two Inspectors of Coal-Mines are required. They will be elected
by open competition. That intending candidates may not be in the
dark as to the ºl. qualifications, they are frankly told that
they “must have been employed within the last five years for at
least two years underground in a coal-mine.” The salary ought to
be large to compensatemen for passing so much of their lives under-
ground. . Never to come to the earth's surface, never to see the light
of day, for two whole years! Enough to undermine the strongest
Constitution.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 229
OCCASIONAL HAPPY THOUGHTS.
HE Cob is brought out into
CLUMBER's Stableyard. We—
MR. SPOKER, CLUMBER, and my-
self—eye it in silence. Bein
nervous about committing myse
on the subject, I do not intend
to be the first to speak.
“Beautiful Cob, that l” says
MR. CLUMBER, finding that he
must, say something. , He is
standing by me, with his legs
wide apart, his hands clasped
behind his back, and his head
very much on one side, eyeing
the mare, not me. * He auty.
she is! feauty tº he repeats,
as if he really couldn't É. over
the fact of her overwhelming
loveliness.
The Ostler, who is holding the
mare's head in a rope halter,
sniffs assent, and relieves his
feelings in a slight cough. He
squints so horribly that I don't
know whether he has his eye on
me, or CLUMBER, or SPOKER; or
- ------- one eye on CLUMBER and myself,
- on the left-hand side of the
horse, and the other on SpokER, who is on the horse's right.
He is a capital man for CLUMBER to have out to show the horse,
as it is impossible to tell from either of the Groom’s eyes, whether
everything is going on in a straightforward manner or not.
I am inclined to think º: is not quite straightforward,
and have a yague idea of being done by CLUMBER, Spokº, and the
Squinting Groom, who, Ifancy (it’s only fancy) are all “stan
1Il >
“A be-auty,” repeats CLUMBER, apparently so rapt in the con-
templation of the animal’s perfections as to be lost in an ecstasy,
and to be rather delivering #. of a sºliloquy, than addressing
anyone of whose presence he is at all conscious. “A little 'orse like
her ain't to be met with every day of the week; no, nor yet in a
whole year, go all over England and give what you like for 'em.
She’s a little”orse as don't mind work,+the more the work, the
better she does it, and a free goer as it’s quite a pleasure to see
along the road. None of your dancing-master toe-and-trip-up; no,
but a good flat, firm, light, and yet-as-you-may-say, solid tread,
that don't come down in the same place as where it went up, but
takes you over the ground, and ull do her fourteen mile an hour in
a dog-cart any day, with a fair country. Why, she's as high-
couraged as a thoroughbred,” he says, as if he was *P.
some objection, which, perhaps, he thought I looked as if I were
§ to make—not that I have been able at present to collect any
efinite ideas on the subject, except that I am still haunted by the
one notion that I am being done—that CLUMBER is doing me, and that
SPOKER and the Groom are “standing in,” and secretly taking a
lesson in the art of selling a horse from CLUMBER, to whose speech
they listen with undisguised admiration.
Not that the Groom's eye expresses anything except squinting;
but his mouth does, and he's evidently enjoying CLUMBER.
I seem to hear the Squinting Groom º himself, “Lor,
ain't Master a wunner at gammonin' a gent into buying a 'oss as he
knows nothin' at all about.”
“She’s better than a thoroughbred, she is,” says CLUMBER, who
is warming with his subject, and is clearly not going to stick, at a
trifle. “For my part, and iknow something of horses, I wouldn't
have a thoroughbred at a gift. Now there!” he adds, quite defiantly,
as if again detecting me in the act of making another objection,
“I wouldn't! No, not if a thoroughbred was hoffered to me, I
wouldn't.” - -
CLUMBER throws in an occasional aspirate with considerable effect.
He expects some observation from me. * So I say, as if surprised
at what }. has told me, and as if it were quite the last thing I should
have expected of him, “No, indeed? %. you, really?”
“No, I wouldn't,” he repeats, emphatically, and then, as if afraid
of a digression interfering with present, business, he resumes his
theme. “But here’s a horse as is a credit to a gentleman. She'd
just do for you. A º gentleman's horse, she is; that’s
what she is; a thorough gentleman's horse.”
He has evidently hit upon the right phrase at last, for he repeats
over and over again that she is “a thorough gentleman's horse,
that’s what she is,” and evidently means to stereotype this happy
expression for future use. He can't get beyond it; there it is. §
can’t (it seems to imply) be more than a thorough gentleman, and
she's the yerything for such a thorough gentleman as you (mean-
ing myself as the intending purchaser) are. Or, if you are not quite
the thorough gentleman, then put this horse into your dog-cart, and
your reputation will be made.
I’m aware that I ought to do something now. I feel that my
turn has come. I ought to ask about her “points.”. I think, too,
I ought to examine her mouth; I know that one tells the age of a
horse by its mouth. But how? False teeth? Stupid of me not to
have read up the subject before I came here. "
Happy Thought.--To appear as if I could ſº of her age without
bothering myself about the mouth. Isay, in as horsey and knowing
a manner as I can assume (though I feel the Squinting Groom sees
through me in every direction),
“She’s not very young, tho', eh?”
SPOKER takes upon himself to reply to this.
“She’s not over five I think, Sir.”
I can't help remarking what a fine horse she is for five years old.
It really seems no age. I wish I’d read up all about the ages of
horses, how long they live, and how long they’re good for work, in
“Stonehenge” or some other authority. em. Buy a book on
“The Horse,” and come out prepared.
h The Squinting Groom opens her mouth, and the horse tosses her
ead.
“Woalass, then! Woa beauty!” says the Groom.
CLUMBER, who has apparently been absorbed in thought during
this colloquy, now addresses Spökºn.
“She’s ºff. yes, rising five, that’s what she is.”
“Rising five?” repeats SpokER, inquiringly.
“Rising, five,” returns CLUMBER, as though anxious to be most
careful and particular on this point.
As I have no means of contradicting this statement, I accept it.
Still I can’t help thinking that if the mare is really a grandmother
(and as far as I can tell I don't see why she shouldn't be), how they
must all be laughing at me in their sleeves.
Happy #:::::::: pass my hand over its hind-quarters,
This evidently is a horsey and knowing sort of thing to do, as it
seems to interest the Squinter, and makes the horse a trifle restive.
ding |I|haven’t the smallest idea what knowledge of the horse's sound-
ness I am to gain bypassing my hand thus over her hind-quarters;
but as she herself rather appears to resent it, I am led to ask,
dubiously, and quite as if I were on the very brink of discovering
her one weak point, “Is she quiet?”
CLUMBER doesn't, seem to have heard my question. SpokER
repeats it loudly to him, and CLUMBER puts his hand to his ear.
The Gentleman asks if she's quiet?” SPOKER shouts.
“Quiet P” repeats CLUMBER, softly—his voice is tender and
husky—as though he scarcely realised that such a question would
have been put by any one in his senses.
SPOKER nods.
The Groom takes the opportunity to inform me that MR. CLUM-
BER is “a bit 'ard o'earin' on one side.”
CLUMBER, having mastered the question, turns to me, and replies,
“Quiet! Why a child might drive her l’”
Happy Thought.—To inquire whether, as a matter of fact, a child
has ever driven her. I pass on, however, to another subject. “Any
tricks?” I ask, as though she were a conjuror.
. SPOKER shouts this twice to CLUMBER. This process gives CLUMBER
time. (By “tricks” I mean, P. 44 §f she kick me off, or
have me off somehow, directly I get on, or soon afterwards?”)
“Tricks!” exclaims CLUMBER (always huskily), as surprised as
if this was the first time he'd ever heard such a thing even hinted
at about a horse of his. “Tricks! Not one that I know of. No
vice. She's quiet in the stable, ain't she, ToM P”
“As a lamb,” replies the Groom, gruftly, squinting all round
the horse's head: “you can do anythink a'most with her. I don’t
think as I ever comed across such another quiet oss as she is. Woa,
beauty l’” l
As the peaceful animal begins at this moment to show signs of
restiveness, CLUMBER, quite equal to the occasion, says
*Walk her up the road, ToM.” Then, as she is led out, with
great caution on the part of the diplomatic ToM (I notice that she
goes out of the yard with a nervous jerking back of the head, as if
she were expecting some one to hit her over the eye), CLUMBER ex-
plains her impatience to me, reasonably enough, by saying, “You
see she’s been standing herein the cold sometime, and she’s a high-
couraged horse, she is.”
I watch her performance on the road with much interest. The
Groom runs with her, and she trots, admirably it seems to me. . He
runs back with her, and she canters, also admirably, with perhaps
just such a hint of kicking up as makes me, standing where I am,
feel a trifle nervous about my knees. I generally feel nervousness
in my knees. (Note for Typical Developments. ees and Nervous-
ness. Their connection. Vol. xix., chap. 8.) CLUMBER observes
that she’s a bit fresh now, but there’s no vice–none.
“Take her in, ToM,” he says.
ToM disappears with her into the stable, and I hear what sounds

look at CLUMBER, who doesn't hear these sounds.
SpokER does, and draws his attention to it. .
“O,” says Čiurger, “that’s the old grey. She's fidgety in
the stable. The little mare's right enough.”
We enter the stable, and certainly there is the little mare in the
stable “right enough.”
To come to the point, I ask what CLUMBER wants for her. SpokER
ats this to him, when he replies, to SpokER, not to me,
“Well, I don't quite know as she ain't already sold to a gentleman
in Devonshire, as was very sweet upon her.”
Now that there is a chance of not getting her, I say, “Q, never
mind the gentleman in Devonshire,” and I at once begin to feel that
she is º: after all this trouble), just the thing to suit me.
“I’d like to part with her to you, Sir,” says CLUMBER, pathe-
tically, “’cos I know as she's sure of a good home.”
He evidently doesn't think much of the gentleman in Devonshire.
He speaks of her having a “good home” with me as though I
should keep her in the drawing-room, and, by implication, that the
gentleman in Devonshire would put her out in the dust-hole. I
appreciate the compliment to my humanity. , In, CLUMBER's eyes
I am the merciful man who is merciful to his beast. I am flattered
by his preference. Come, let him name his price.
“Well,” he says, as if deliberating a nice point, “I can't exactly
say now, because she don't belong to me altogether, as you may say
—she belongs to my Father-in-law, and he won't comeback till the
day after to-morrow, and I don't quite know what he'd say about it
if I’d parted with her while he was away. But,” says he, brighten-
ing up, and becoming a trifle less husky than usual, “if he don't
want to keep her—and he's very fond of the little mare, 'cos she's
so gentle with children,” (quite touching this: the tender side
of CLUMBER's character) “I’ll let you know the day after
to-morrow.”
Good. Agreed. Mem.—To hear from CLUMBER; day after to-

TREMENDOUS SELF-SACRIFICE.
AMONG the regulations respecting Temporary Writers in the
Public Departments, recently put forth in the London,Gazette, the
following noble and generous proviso must command admiration:—
“9. No service, however much it may happen to be prolonged, will confer
any claim to superannuation or compensation allowance.”
Yes, this is noble; this is generous, not, indeed, as a stipulation
simply considered, nor yet if taken in connection merely with the
other ordinances concerning writers and candidates for writerships
in the Civil Service. For it and they, even those which are in a
measure concessionary, are all so worded as to seem to have been
conceived in the spirit of a Board of Poor Law Guardians, with a
Beadle for their amanuensis, and a view to a crowd of casual and
vicious paupers, begging for employment, besieging the workhouse
oor. The nobleness and generosity characteristie of the notice that
no service, however much it may happen to be prolonged, will confer
on the miserable wretches disc jº. it at last any claim to
the allowance which, at the close of a life occupied with official
labour, must be needed to save them from destitution, consist in the
intended self-denial implied by that arrangement on the part of
other Temporary Public Servants than poor Writers. A high-
minded Government will not be harder º. indigent subordinates
than they are upon themselves... Have they not already given mp.
the old accustomed Ministerial Whitebait, Dinner? Of course, Her
Majesty's Ministers mean to decline Retiring Pensions.
Rude Cityl
THE City of London is foremost in deeds of hospitality, charity,
and munificence, but it is sadly behindhand in acts of g try.
Alone, of all the Metropolitan Constituencies, the City did not allow
the Ladies to vote at the School Board Election. The Corporation
may tremble in their shoes and boots. The energetic female will
now be clamorous for reform.

BEN, excuse not truth's transgression,

“Blundering” was a fair expression;
“Plundering” is a word too strong.
Liberal Ministers may blunder.
Some have done so now and then.
Thieves and Tories only plunder;
Mark that observation, BEN
“Plundering” is, instead of labour,
Picking purse, or forcing till,
So as to deprive your neighbour
Of his goods against his will.

For that legal confiscation
Statesmen can't be sent to gaol.
Thus, to bribe the working classes,
What although they cheapen tea,
Coffee, sugar, and molasses;
so the breakfast-table free?
What is property's invasion,
Meant to gain a faction's aid,
Though it failed, on one occasion,
To destroy the tapster's trade?
Call it “policy,” not “plunder;”
Very different things, look you.

SCOTCH REWENGE AGAINST WIT.
ThE Interness Courier informs us that two yºung Scotchmen
recentlyº a joke of the most telling kind. There was a
fair at Fordyce, in Banffshire. After dark the gay young wits
fastened a wire across a road,
—“so as to entirely obstruct the traffic. Soon after, a dog-cart, containing
three men, came along the road, and the horse, coming against the wire,
tripped and fell, "...ºf the machine, and dashing its occupants to the
ground. The men were all more or less injured, the dog-cart was broken and
damaged, and the horse cut and bruised.”
We have not often laughed so much as at this outbreak of true
humour. We regret to add that wits, like prophets, have no honour
in their own country. The light-hearted fellows were laid hold of
by the cold, stern hand of Law, and SHERIFF GoRDON (whose name
should go down to posterity in company, with that of SIR THoMAs
Lucy) sentenced them to thirty days' imprisonment, without the
option of a fine. Wit is a fatal gift in a prosaic land. In England,
now, where there is much more real appreciation of mirth, we allow
farmers and other landowners to do about the same thing without
any hindrance or punishment. We let them conceal wires in their
hedges, and break the necks of man, woman, and child unsuspect-
*f; engaged in the pursuit of harmless and healthy sport.
early as he loves pleasantries, however, Punch wishes there were
Sheriff GoRDONs in every hunting county in England.
Nonconformity and Knowledge.
PROFound thinkers sometimes overlook facts lying on the surface.
Among all the disputants for and against religious instruction in
national schools, there is not one to whom appears to have occurred
the question how much religion is ever taught in any school what-
spever? Might not, Dissenters safely rest satisfied that denomina-
ºachins would be perfectly irreligious if they would leave it
oile
UTILISATION OF PROSE.
FIGURED Shirts have of late come extensively into wear. A neat
thing in this kind of under-clothing has been brought under our
notice. It is denominated the School Board Shirt, and its speciality
consists in its being printed all over with leading articles and
speeches on the subject of Education. This is designed not only
with a view to ornament, but also, and indeed rather, to utility.
The peculiar recommendation of the School Board Shirt is that it
constitutes an efficient preservative against cold, rheumatism. and
other disorders that are apt to be caused by damp linen...When-
soever and howsoever the School Board Shirt may come from the
wash, the print of which forms its pattern remains reading of such
a nature as to keep it always thoroughly dry.
A Black Diamond Drop.
The best news we have heard of late is that coals have fallen
suddenly three shillings a ton. Still eight-and-thirty shillings is a
terrible price for Wallsend—which is not really Wallsend, and
indeed in many cases is hardly more combustible than the stones,
or bricks and mortar which its name seems to imply. With coals at
such a price, we are not surprised to see that “The Diamond Fuel
Company” has been started to supply us. We never sit by our fire-
side now without thinking what we #. for such a precious luxury.
Our black diamonds are gems wellnigh too costly for combustion.
Haply we may live to see them set in necklaces and bracelets, like
other members of the brilliant family whence sprang the Koh-i-Noor.

FACTS AND FIGURES.
For the use of our own Statistical Society.
A GENTLEMAN, in easy circumstances, residing in Belgravia, has
made the computation that Society at present owes him sixty-nine
Umbrellas, of the value in the aggregate of £53 8s. 6d., which he
has left at various houses, or ‘....". various pretexts have been
borrowed or abstracted from him, since he first set up housekeeping
a score of years ago.
Notwithstanding the admirable Lectures upon Cookery, which
have excited such sensation in the fashionable world, it is believed
that at the present time only one (so-advertised) “professed” Cook
out of fifty, wanting forty pounds a year, besides her tea and beer,
knows how to fry a sole crisp, or to dry-boil a *. or to serve a
savoury omelette, which tastes of anything but mildew, garlic,
grease, and superannuated eggs.
The worth of Wedding Presents has been variously estimated.
In certainly not more than thirteen cases in a hundred, the orna-
mental nick-nacks which have been selected have proved to be con-
structed of sufficient durability to last above a twelvemonth: while
the gifts which have been chosen for their positive utility have been
found upon the average scarce exceeding two per cent.
Out of five-and-twenty Cabmen, privately examined, eighteen
have alleged that, when they think it practicable, they always
charge for babies; six have stated that their rule is not to smoke
inside their cabs while waiting for a lady; eleven have declared
that they expect no extra pay for carrying in the luggage when
there is a footman present; thirteen have protested that they never
pawn left articles, not even silk umbrellas; and not fewer than
seven have professed their perfect willingness to depose on oath that
under no temptation ever have º º aforeigner.
Railway Guard computes, as the result of his own personal ex-
Fº that the fines which should be levied upon ladies of good
amily, who fraudulently manage to smuggle in their lap-dogs,
beneath their cloaks, and wrappers, without paying for a dog's
ticket, exceed, upon the average, twenty thousand pounds a year.
At a Circulating Library of extensive reputation it has been shown
that ninety-three per cent of novel-readers always turn the leaf down
when they want to mark their place, and that only two per cent. of
them have sufficient education or mental self-command to abstain
from under-scoring, or making foolish marginal reflections on the
text.
At the Cattle Show last year there were present at one time a
dozen Vegetarians, who had never since their babyhood tasted a
beefsteak. - - - -
It has been calculated lately, by a careful Statistician, that the
value of the bouquets thrown last season at the Opera, in round
numbers, amounted to eleven thousand pounds. -
The Lodgers having Latchkeys at loose in the Metropolis amount
it is believed, to one hundred and fifty thousand, seven hundre
and sixteen. - -
Guesses have been made as to the value of the “perquisites”
claimed yearly by the Cooks at the West End; but it is feared that
the Police are, at present, too much interested to permit of their
collecting statistics on the subject.

London and Elsewhere.
THE omnibus- and cab-men have held a meeting to deprecate the
further employment of asphalte as a pavement for the streets of
London. Among comic Irish melodies once popular there was one
in which occurs the protestation that
“London, agrah! is the divil's own shop.”
The asphalte pavement was designed for the abatement of noise;
but the horses go down on it. It was laid with good intentions, but
thus, so far as it extends, the pavement of London appears to
resemble that of the locality referred to in the foregoing line.

Paul Jones and the Flying Dutchman in chase of the Great Sea †: in High
Latitudes, although perhaps at first sight it may look a little lengthy and com-
plicated, seems to promise endless diversion. The same may also be said of The
Goblin Gnome of the Palace of Black Brilliants and the Mottled Mandrake of
the Spangled Glen ; or, the Shah, the Strike, and the School-Board. The con-
cluding tableau of this spectacle, representing the Realms of Radiant Rapture
and the Phantom Sprites of the Gem-bound Coast, is said to surpass in lavish
splendour and boundless ingenuity all antecedent scenic displays. Those who
pation, both old
to the Christmas
find an inexhaustible stimulant in fairy legend and
nursery lore will, we have reason to believe, not be dis-
appointed with Harlequin Jack and Jill and St. George
and the Dragon and the Four-and-Twenty Blackbirds:
or, Oberon-Aladdin and the Forty Thieves in the Great
Bed of Ware in the Castle of Otranto. - --
Many more promising titles might be indicated, but
enough, perhaps, has been said to stimulate a seasonable
curiosity and satisfy the most inordinate expectations.

ROB ROY MARRIED.
ON the recent occasion of the marriage of JoBN, more
widely known as “Rob Roy MacGREGoR-(not the
cateran—the canoeist pioneer of canoe exploration, and
founder of the Canoe Club, and, better still, hard
working member of the London School Board, and
staunch and generous friend of the Shoeblack Brigade
and the training-ship boys), his club-fellows--we are
informed by the Daily News—have presented him with
a claret jug and goblet with an inscription “in recogni-
tion of #. efforts to improve canoes, promote canoeing,
and unite canoeists.”
MR. MACGREGoR's services to the great canoe-cause are
all very well, but his canoeing comrades would do well
to remember that his best credit has been won not “by
paddling his own camoe,” but by pulling a labouring oar
among the skulls * in *.*.*. on the good
ship “Education.” In honour of his services in that
ship, Punek is glad to sing :-
Hymen's Happiest Voyage to you,
Rob Roy MACGREgor, 0.1
Ne'er may tide or breeze undue
From its fair way sideways slue
Your connubial canoe,

CERTAINLY EDUCATE GIRLS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
YoUR Correspondent, ANGELINA, last week gave you a
leasant but frivolous conversation, in support of her view that no
igh education is wanted by a girl, whose business it is to make
herself pleasant, and to get married.
I concede the latter proposition, but there are men who are not
to be won by twaddle and an incessant use of the word “awful.” I
beg leave to subjoin a report of the conversation that led to my en-
gagement, and I am,
Yours affectionately,
WANESSA.
SCENE-Dinner. A large Party.
CADENUS has taken WANESSA down, having been introduced to her ten
minutes previously. They sit.
Cadenus. You have plenty of room, I hope 2 (Sotto voce.) We are
rather closely packed.
Vanessa. Plenty, thanks. (Eramines menu.) Who was it said,
“What a number of things there are here that I do not want” P
Cadenus.
“Man wants but little here below,
Nor wants that little long.”
But we are going to have a long dinner, anyhow. However, I am
the gainer.
anessa. Why?
Cadenus. “Situated as I am,” as MRs. GERMAN REED sings.
Vanessa. Please don't begin to be civil, especially before you
know whether you are a gainer or not.
Cadenus. One of the old dramatists makes a young lady say—
“Give me him dare love
At first encounter.”
Vanessa. Very likely. , You know we mustn't read the old
º: But I like the word encounter—it takes fighting for
granted.
Cadenus. Our natural state is one of war, says HobBEs of
Malmesbury.
Vanessa. But there is a classical condemnation—I'm afraid I
was going to § curse—upon anybody who quarrels at meals.
Cadenus. Tell me where that occurs.
Punessa. Ah! You think I don’t know. Well, I won't quote,
but wasn’t there a Miss HippoDAMIA, at whose marriage—
Cadenus. The Centaurs and the Lapithae took too much wine. I
am glad to find that you care about old stories.
Vanessa. Surely that is better reading than our modern weddin
descriptions—how the bride looked lovely in lace and silver, an
each of the bridesmaids had a beautiful locket, with her monogram.
Cadenus.
“On her white breast a sparkling gaud she wore,
Which Jews might guess cost, bleth me, four-pound-four.”
Vanessa. Don't! I hate parodies. And I do love Pope. Don't
#. pink that the editor of the grand new edition is very hard upon
lm.
Cadenus. Nobody can be too hard upon anybody. It is a wicked
world, and the fewer people we praise the better.
Vanessa. There is an excellent paper in the Spectator which
advises us to praise people, on the chance of their being stimulated
to deserve the good opinion they think we have formed of them.
. Cadenus, Very well, remembered. But it is of no use lauding
folks who have gone ad majores.
Vanessa. And yet, de mortuis—
Cadenus. Nil nisi verum.
nº. You would not get your living by writing epitaphs, I
think.
Cadenus. Derivation of “epitaph?”
Vanessa. Epi upon, taphos, a tomb. Do you take me for a charity
girl, or a writer of modern novels? Or is this a competitive
examination ?
Cadenus (tenderly and with intense meaning). No, there is no
competition?
anessa. I rather fancied you not the sort of person who needs to
be told a thing twice.
Cadenus. Bis repetita placebit, when some people say it.
Vanessa. Well turned. And as that darling girl, Miss, in
Polite Conversation, says, “Another turn, and I j have turned
away from you.”
Cadenus. She says no such thing, and you know it. Yes, Miss
is a darling, and didn't she want her ears boxed:
Vanessa. Not half so much as those dreadful matrons. Mind, I
read a copy which a friend had edited, with great blottings out, but
the awful vulgarity of the women is inextinguishable. By the
way, did DEAN SwiFT write the Last Years of Queen Anne, or
not
Cadenus. I am ashamed to say I never considered the question.
But MR. DISRAELI's father was a rare authority, and if he told his

Vanessa. “Eternal smiles his emptiness betray,
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way.”
Cadenus. I suppose that’s the solution, though he is your brother,
for he has certainly got a very “gracious Silence” next him, as
Coriolanus says. -
Vanessa. A descendant of Master Justice Silence, perhaps.
Cadenus. How do you know that the eminent Beak was a

Vanessa. Well, he sings
“Be merry, be merry, my wife has all.”
Cadenus. Go on.
Vanessa. Why not? HEtravelling Public,

Cadenus. Yes, I do, and that he will be like GIBBoN, when he
could not rise from his knees, on which he had fallen to the blue-
eyed Agnes.

Vanessa (smiles). She is considered very beautiful.
Cadenus. I admire her dress's semidiaphanity, which suggests a
better arm than it covers. But I can understand her finding favour
in the eyes of sundry persons.
Vanessa. ...Who would find none in yours? However, she is
engaged to “some gentleman who fights, or writes, or drives.”
Cadenus. Fights, if I were to guess. Her intellect would pro-
bably be dangerous to a heavy.
Vanessa. You are not to laugh at the military. I have several
relations in the Army, and they are not at all heavy: An educated
soldier, who is a clever man, and has seen service, and can talk well,

Cadenus. Subknocko. I with you to the fullest extent, and
I am sure that all your combative relations deserve such a descrip-

you would ji everybody that she was a most accomplished linguist.

Vanessa. I am not Hercules, come.
Cadenus...Who educated you—who taught you?, Qr, as JoHN

in, to the minute,
costly, and sponta-
neous precautions
against accidents
which , , endanger
life and limb, uni-
formly taken by
Railway Directors,
will grieve to hear
of the severe pe-
cuniary losses in-
curred by unfortu-
nate failure to
avert casualties of
that nature, in two
instances, which
have been sustained by two several Companies, the London and North-
Western, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire. Against the former of
these an action was brought last Wednesday by a Wesleyan Minister
named TELFER, in the Manchester Assize Court, for loss of livelihood
as a preacher and lecturer, through injuries received in a collision at
Widnes in November, 1872. A jury, evidently estimating both the
value of a Wesleyan Minister and the resources of a Railway Com-
pany at an equally high figure, awarded MR. TELFER damages to the
amount of no less than £1250. At the same assizes, MR. KENYoN, a
potato-dealer, sued the latter of the above-named companies for
serious injuries from, an accident, at Salford. The potato-dealer,
rated even more highly than the Methodist preacher, obtained the
compensation of £2500. These are heavy sums for poor Railway
Directors to have the discredit of losing, but though .# of
every sympathy, they will, it is to be jºi. only redouble their
exertions to prevent the occurrence of those lamentable mishaps too
9ften occurring to litigious persons, and subjecting companies to
lawsuits resulting in damages which make large holes in dividends.
Apprehended Outrage.
CANON KINGSLEY, the other evening, in the chair at a meeting
held at the Jews' Infant. School, Whitechapel, to promote the
reopening of certain Baths and Wash-houses, delivered some
felicitous, observations, on water, associated, no doubt, by his
fascinated readers with water Babies." Other speakers having
otherwise instructed or entertained, the assembly, resolutions were
adopted; the first of them being:—“That it is highly desirable to
reopen and place upon a permanent footing the baths and wash-
houses in Goulston §º As the word footing means a ground
for the foot, it is too probable that its occurrence in the above con-
nection has occasioned some desperate offender to perpetrate the
atrocity of calling the baths to be placed on a permanent one foot-
baths; thus putting his own foot in it.
A Professor's Oversight.
PROFESSOR MAx MULIER is something more than even a profºund
scholar, so that one thinks once, twice, thrice, four, fiye, and, six
times and more before questioning what he says. Yet, when holding
forth on Intercession Day in Westminster Abbey—thanks to broad-
minded DEAN STANLEY-he told the º: that “a religion must
sooner or later cease to exist if it ceased to be missionary,” and that
“the three religions which were alive were the three missionary
religions, the Buddhist, the Mahometan, and the Christian reli-
gions,” one cannot help so far ºff. these statements, which
imply that every other religion besides those three religions is dead
or * only a nominal existence, as to ask what MR. SolomoNS would
say

LAWRENCE'S BEST LORDSHIP.
THERE's life in the old British Lion still;
When he, who late held the Vice-regal helm,
O'er the thrice fifty millions that fill
The brimming borders of our Indian realm,
I+. down more potent power, more royal rule,
an e'er was swayed by Khalif or Mogul,
For London's School-Board chair, and patient sits,
Through infinite debate, and weary war
Of words with words, or, rarer, wits with wits,
Seeing, through stour of strife, the É. afar;
And finds his earned rest, not in idle hours,
But in new battle with more hideous powers,
Than those whose idols stretch their sheafs of hands
O'er the bowed blindness of the Indian crowd,
Prostrate before them on the wide waste sands
Upon whose marge beats the Black-water" loud—
Devilish powers with light and love at war,
Whose empire, than our Indian realm more wide,
Whose sway, than Kalee's,t blacker, bloodier, far,
Asks wills as firm, their will to over-ride,
Hearts as stout, heads as clear, their way to bar,
As India asks of the Vice-regal Lord
Who, for her good, sways sceptre and bears sword.
Then, not less green the wreath for LAWRENCE wound,
The first to guide the Board that guides the School,
Than that we twined those sad, stern brows around,
Worn with the iron crown of Indian rule.
* The Indian name for the Ocean.
+ The Indian Goddess of extermination and wrath.
NICELY Bound.—We are all familiar with “best calf” in another
form besides excellent veal, but perhaps it may not be *}. well
known that “coloured sheep” (not to be confounded with blackfaced
mutton) is also to be found on our tables.
WINTER FASHIONS.
“Polonaises, if made of cloth, may be very plain. . . . The pockets which
are so much worn, add very greatly to the style; they are made large, and
placed in front, on the hips, or at the back. Sometimes there are five-two
in front, two behind, and a small breast-pocket.”
It is unnecessary to name the publication which gives us this
valuable information. It is known all over the world, wherever a
Milliner has found a show-room, or a Dressmaker displays her
patterns. But what can a lady want with five pockets—five large
pockets? Let us see. Supposing her keys, her purse, her handker-
chief, and her card-case all require separate, accommodation, there
will still be a pocket to spare. "Is it reserved for a smelling-bottle,
or for the volume of Shakspeare or Milton which is now the con-
stant companion of the women of the present ... If she is a
young lady, and engaged to be married, we can understand the use
of the º pocket. She may naturally wish to carry about with
her, in some safe receptacle, a cabinet portrait with the hair accu-
rately parted down the middle, and the precious locket well displayed
on the manly waistcoat-and for this purpose the breast-pocket
seems admirably designed.
Do not, dear Ladies, imitate vulgar Man in one more respect. Do
not thrust your dainty hands into these tempting front pockets—an
ugly trick, which all the laws and traditions of good society dis-
countenance and condemn.
Economy of Fuel.
WE'LL be merry yet, old fellows.
Never mind the price of coals!
Sing old Rose and burn the bellows;
Thence with warmth to cheer your souls.
We no more again to blow them
Can afford; shall ne'er require.
Fit for fuel only, throw them,
Therefore, on our winter's fire.

OCCASIONAL HAPPY THOUGHTS.
ERY. Happy Thought.—To
call at MR. TRott's, the
Weterinary Surgeon.
Here’s another object
for a walk. A variation
on Stamps. One day a
walk for Stamps; an-
other, walk to Veterina
Surgeon. Awkward word,
Veterinary. Can't say it
well, without shaking
your head.
I can get TRoTT, who
bears the hi tº cha-
racter as a Wet (jaunty
abbreviation this) and a
CLUMBER's mare. TROTT
will tell me if it is “Just
: *†. thing I want.”
R. TROTT, a long man
in tight trowsers, hard
gloves, and a loose,
weather-stained overcoat,
is starting, in a lofty gig,
for around of professional
“If you don't object to stepping up here, Sir,” he says from the
box-seat, “and won't mind my calling at Flipster's Hatch on the
road, I'll go on straight to CLUMBER's afterwards. It’ll be all in
my way.
# accept, and climb up into the gig.
What strikes me about TROTr's gig, is, considering TROTT's pro-
fession, its remarkable appearance of carelessness.
It has, evidently, seen a great deal of wear and tear. The wear
being in the wood part, and the tear in the leather.
TRott's horse—which he drives apparently so negligently, that I’ve tº
half a mind, to ask him whether, it wouldn't be as well to hold the
reins a little, tighter, only that he's a Wet, and must know what
he’s about--is a long-backed, anyhow-jointed animal, slinging
along as º as TROTT drives, with his head straight out in a
lolloping way, as if he were over-weighted in the nose. I notice,
too, that he moves with an occasional hitch-up of his hind-quarters,
gºing me of a stage-sailor's action, when he says, “Ay, ay,
ir I
Happy Thought.—Evidently an animal for a Horse Marine.
Suggest to TRoTT to send him out to the Gold Coast, as a first instal-
ment towards a Mounted Contingent.
I tell TROTT what I want him to do, and he is of opinion that I am
quite right to call him in.
“It’s worth your while to wait,” MR. TroTT says, “and to give
| a ten-pun' note more for a horse that won't come down on his nose
within a week after you’ve bought him.”
Quite so. My sentiments exactly. I say, “Yes, as long as I get
something that suits me, I don't mind a ten-pound note either way.”
By which I mean ten pounds less, if possible.
“Just so,” says MR. Thott.
We turn in at a gate. A tumble-down house, dirty, sloshy road,
and dilapidated-looking outbuildings.
Flipster's Hatch.
A boy, in a smock, stands at the horse's head, and TRott, saying
ºn't be five minutes, gets down, and disappears into a dirty
I suppose this is a Farm. “Flipster's Hatch” as a name is not
tºº of anything in particular, except, perhaps, Chickens.
“Colney Hatch,” of course, is a Lunatic Asylum, but not all
Lunatiºs are kept under Hatches... There's such a neglected air
about the whole place, that I think it must be a Farm in Chancery.
h IIappy Thought.—Or a “Homestead” when the people are not at
Orne.
A shabby man, with a shirt that ought to have been sent to the
wash three days ago, and with a black frock coat, black waistcoat,
black tie, and grey trousers, not a bit, like a farmer (but more like
an undertaker who’d not quite finished dressing), comes out from a
side door, and, looking §: me, says,
“Come, and have a loºk at the Cºw.”
This takes me so by surprise, that I can’t help showing it.
“I beg your pardon. t?”
* Come, and have a look at the Cow.”
Perhaps he means this for hospitality. Or perhaps it is something
curious which he wishes me, as a visitor, to see.
Not to offend him, I reply, “Thank you, yes, with pleasure.”
I like being shown over farms. That is, iiike getting up as
Dealer, to go and look at C
quickly as possible all the information I can on any subject what-
eyer. It occurs to me as º: (now I come to § of it) that
this is the first time in my life I ever have been specially invited to
“look at a Cow.”
We pick our way (I mean I pick mine, and he trudges) through a
very dirty yard (this is evidently not a model farm, where you could
“eat your #. off the floor of a É. as a model farmer once
said to me), and come to a low, shed-like sort of stable.
mucky place. -
Happy Thought.—All-Muck's.
I wonder the Drainage Commissioners (or somebody) aren't down
on this mucky farmer.
Happy Thought.—Good name for a dirty Scotch Farmer, MR.
MUCKINTYRE. Don't say this to my companion for several reasons.
Firstly, because I think he wouldn't understand it. Secondly,
because if he understood it he wouldn't like it., Thirdly, because, he,
E. isn't Scotch, and wouldn't care much about it. Fourthly,
ecause, if he is Scotch, his º (or Lowland, or Midland) blood
will be up. Fifthly, because -
A very
e is now drawing my attention to the
ow.
I thought he was going to show me a magnificent Alderney, or a
splendid Something-or-other (1 forget what other sort of cows there
are, and at this moment I can only remember that the Southdowns
are sheep not cows), and here I find a dirty-white, fly-bitten, over-
sized Cow, lying in a loose box on heaps of straw, moaning, blowing,
rolling, and, I should say, if I were asked at once what I thought
about her, as mad as a hatter. [How about “Flipster's 'Hatch”
now? Asylum for Lunatic Cows. Why not ? Wouldn't vaccina-
tion from a Lunatic Cow account for a great deal of — Mem.
Note this for Typical Developments under L. C., Wol. XVII.]
The Farmer, or whatever †. is (for the more I see of him the less
he comes up to my notion of a farmer-then, of course, my notion
of a farmer i. be wrong), goes into the loose box, and regards her
with a puzzled expression, I stand at the door, looking in like
Paul Pry, when he says, “I hope I don’t intrude,” and my com-
panion says, “I can’t make her out.”
I don't quite understand at first what it is that he can't make out
about her. Whether he means, “Is she a cow or not a cow PIs she
mad or sensible?” As a safe course, I observe, with sympathy,
seems in rather a bad way.”
“Yes,” he continues, “she is that. We followed out the direc-
tions, though: gave her the mashes and the brandy.”
“Brandy? $º. ?” -
“Why,” he replies, as if a little hurt at my question, “as ordered,
this .# A pint.”
IIappy Thought.—Then I can explain the symptoms. The Cow's
drunk. Evidently not “Mad as a Hatter,” but “Drunk as a Fiddler.”
By the way, I must note this (and do now) for Typical Develop-
ments, Volume something, and see where the subject will fit in. I
fancy under “Peculiar Proyerbs,” or “Social Similes.” (“S. S.; ”
don’t think I’ve done much under the letter S at present.) Why
should certain stigmas be affixed to certain trades?
Query.—Was the first Hatter considered a lunatic by people who,
till then, used to go about bare-headed ? Just as the inventor of
Steam was looked upon as a maniacal visionary, because he thought
he could do something a little out of the common with boiling
water.
Second Query.—Was the first Fiddler (evidently an object of envy
because he played first fiddle) looked upon as inebriated? Perhaps
so. I put an instance to º Supposing I met HERR JoACHIM
fiddling his very best for the first time—supposing, also, that I'd
never seen a fiddle in my life, and º in a street, or a
wood, or on the sea-shore, on HenryoACHIM, hard at work practising

OUR COUSINS AT THE CATTLE-SHOW.

GUINEAs.’”
Yankee Friend. ** SIXTY GUINEAS
WHY, we THINK Nothing on 'EM IN our Country UNDER EIGHT THEOUSAND !”
“Your young man don't seem to make much out of the old Cow,”
says the Sort-of-Farmer.
e has mistaken me for MR. TROTT's assistant.
The error being explained, the man only laughs, doesn't apologise,
and says, “I thought he didn't seem to know much about a Cow.”
Whereat MR. TroTT smiles too.
Now, here would be a first-rate opportunity for a repartee, and I
should make it, if I didn't, luckily, look well ahead, and realise
what he'd say in reply. In one flash of thought I figure to myself
the dialogue thus:—
Farmer (jeeringly). You don't know much about Cows?
Myself (pointedly). No; I know more about Donkeys.
†. that I know him, the Farmer, to be a Donkey.
li Farmer. Ah! I should ha’ thought as that was more in your
line.
And what could I reply to this? There ends the repartee. You
can't have anything after this. It would be an anti-climax. Con-
sequently, as it stands, the Farmer would get the best of it, which
is not my idea of a repartee exercise with a farmer.
TROTT, it seems, is calling, professionally, on the Cows.
Spirits of the People.
DIPPING into Spiritualist Newspapers occasionally, you may have
noticed that the Spirits accustomed to “manifest” their presence at
séances usually express themselves in remarkably colloquial terms,
and are called by names and diminutives of names the most common
and domestic, as “John King,” “Katie,” “Peter,” and “Jack.”
Ghosts, by those who thought they saw them, used to be treated
with respect. Perhaps that was because they did not make them-
selves cheap. The communications obtained through “mediums.”
appear to proceed, not exactly from ghosts, but a low order of Spirits
—from familiar spirits, which, embodied or disembodied, encourage
familiarity to º a degree as to illustrate the saying that “fami-
liarity doth breed contempt.”
SCOTCH ECONOMY.
THE student of jocular literature has, in the course of that reading,
been presented with many illustrations of Scotch economy, but here
is one which perhaps beats all that have ever yet been related. It
is extracted from a newspaper:—
“THE PREvention of RAILway. AccIDENTs.-The Caledonian Railway
Company have resolved to discourage accidents on the line by putting a hand-
some premium on discriminating carefulness and zeal in their servants in
future. Every engine-driver in their employment who can show a bill of
twelve months' running without ... casualty, is to receive a reward
of £5; and in the same way every guardsman and breaksman similarly cir-
cumstanced will get £3.”
Clearly there could have been devised no better way to “dis-
courage accidents” on Railways than that of encouraging carefulness
and zeal on the part of Railway Servants. There can be no doubt
that it is to the discouragement, by the under-payment, of servants
employed on Railways, many, if not most, of the accidents which
occur are owing. The contrary of this false parsimony may be con-
fidently expected to result in great comparative gain. That of the
Caledonian Directors is true parsimony, Caledonian parsimony,
canny Scotch parsimony, the parsimony of those who understand
what parsimony is—the parsimony that pays. What they lay out
in rewards for careful service will be a light insurance against heavy
damages, and the “parsimonia” of those truly economical Scotchmen
will, no doubt, prove “magnum vectigal” indeed.
SPIRITUAL.
A PLACARD extensively Pºsted about is "surmounted with the
heading “Save your Coal!” This must be suggestive to the
Religious Tract Society. The wayfarer will soon, perhaps, have
thrust into his hand a serious little treatise, bearing, with a slight
orthographical alteration, the above title.

MoRE or less sensation was created the other day by
the arrival of the following telegram from Pesth:—
“At yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers M. SLÄvy
announced that he persisted in his determination to resign
office.”
Poor SLÄvy | No doubt he is thoroughly tired of official
drudgery.
“LE MoT (NoN PAS) Pour RIRE”—The situation in
France, under the Ministry of M. DE BROGLIE. An
Im-broglio.
A NEW EXTRAWAGANCE.
} , MANY persons deriving enormous incomes, in these prosperous
times, from business, will, no doubt, jump at the idea of making an
| addition to their expenditure on, ostentation, suggested by the fol-
lowing passage in Le Follet’s “Fashions for i.ecember ºf
“The robes “Princesses,” without tunics or upper skirts, are much worn
for occasions. The skirt is then made with a train or half-train. It is
somewhat difficult to indicate the length this should be, but, for a lady of
ordinary height, the skirt should be from a yard and a half to a yard and
three-quarters at the back for the half-trains, but still longer for the trains for
full evening dress.” -
At present, the wealthy contractors' daughters, the gorgeous
factory-girls, and the other ladies of the plutocracy, who emulate
those of the aristocracy in wearing “Princesses” robes, do no more
than rival them, except in the costliness of their apparel. They do
not, otherwise than in that respect, surpass them, or, as the elegant
phrase is, cut them out. Now the trains of the above-named robes,
which in º of length approach those of railways, afford occasion
for a further extravagance of display, which, for that matter, would
place the wearers of the “Princesses” on a perfect level with the
royal personages so denominated, in point of attire, as these ap-
pear on State occasions. Their fathers or husbands should pro-
vide them with suitable pºe; young fº of some degree
above that of the common “Buttons,” to hold up their trains behind
them as they move about in the assemblies of the opulent, and par-
ticularly whilst they are going down-stairs, when the trains of ladies
| are so apt to get trodden on and torn. The institution of train.
bearers for fashionable females would thus be not only a considerable
comfort to them, but also a great relief to numerous men, who are
continually having the misfortune, in descending a staircase, to
tread on the train of the lady they are walking down behind. These
are of two kinds—the few whom some necessity has involved in a
sumptuous party, whose minds, are elsewhere, and their eyes
elevated in states of thought, and the majority staring in the same
direction at a splendid ceiling. Of course it vexes them, and
especially the former class of them, to find that they have stepped
on a lady's train and made her tear it; besides which they are
liable to get themselves tripped up, and so to tumble on the tail of
guests on the steps below, or even º the steps headfore-
most. As soon as long trains were acknowledged to necessitate
trainbearers, the trains would have to be discontinued by most ladies
but those of the mercantile billionnaires, and a nuisance would be
abated in general Society.
MOSQUITOS' MAGIC MUSIC.
PROFEssoR MAYER, at the Stevens Institute, has been describing
a series of experiments on the antennae, or horns, of the Mosquito.
He finds these horns in the male Mosquito vibrate sympathetically
to the sounds made by the female. -
But the Professor concludes that the highly organised nervous
apparatus in these hitherto imperfectly #. appendages is
meant to enable the insect to detect in the dark the position of sono-
rous centres, and to make for them. Now, this sonorous centre may
be the horn of the female ºf an amorous invitation to the
male; but it may also be the nose of the slee r, playing its uncon-
scious trombone accompaniment to his slumbers. The nose-organ
plays—the air vibrates to its stertorous bass—the º Mosquito's
antennae quiver, and guide him through the night to the centre of
sound. He settles, stabs, and sucks. And thus we see hºw beauti-
fully and º, Nature provides even this awfully aggra-
vating little insect, in his antennal apparatus, with a guide, at once,
to the satisfaction of his two strongest appetites—that for his female,
and that for his food | - -
In short, this interesting, but irritating, Hymenoptera is all his
life—all its nocturnal half, at least-pla ; : perpetual game of
magic music, of which now beauty now blood is the prize, and at
one time his wife's horns, at another his victim’s nose, the guiding
instrument of music.

BONDS BETTER REPUDIATED.
MEXICO has been going further in what the Pope considers the
broad way that leads to destruction—that is, in the teeth of the
Church—than, either Russia, Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, or
any other of the Church's lost sheep in the Old World's family of
nations—if they should not rather be called, in the language of
Papal allocution, abomi-nations. The anti-clerical majority in the
Mexican Congress have decreed marriage a civil contract, have
abolished the †. of monastic vows, the right of religious
corporations to hold property, and the celibacy of priests. In short
§§ have completely severed the bonds between Church and State,
in the vast domain which CoRTEz conquered for the Church.
Prosit. All Mexican bonds have hitherto been a proverbially bad
investment, but the Mexican bonds between Church and State are
the first whose repudiation seems likely to increase the credit of the
repudiators.
An Improvement.
WE observe a pleasing novelty in a notice of a recent marriage.
Instead of the .#. Clergymen being announced, with weary-
ing monotony, as the É. of the bride, or the second
cousin of the bridegroom, they were simply styled “friend of the
bride,” “friend of the bridegroom.” We are hopeful now that
“the Wenerable the Archdeacon of Buntingford’” and the “Domestic
Chaplain to the Right Hon. Lord Banbury” will in time both
disappear.

THIS is from a British, a Liverpool, paper. We are ready to

ism to be added to those by which this country is torn and dis-
tracted? Is Cann-b-lism openly practised in the second town of
the kingdom? What are the Ministers of all Denominations doing?
What steps are the Local Authorities taking? We fear it is too
late to prevent the sacrifice of a useful member of society in the
present instance—a victim has probably long ere this been found of
roportions sufficient to satisfy the perverted appetites of “a Large
}. ;” but we trust the beneficial operation of the School
Board and the spread of Education will be traced in the disappear-
ance of such distressing advertisements in the future. Nothing now
can astonish us any more, not even Boiled Butler or Stewed Footman.
Quite Superfluous.
THE Pall Mall Gazette has been publishing an article headed
“What Railway Passengers may do for themselves;”, and, MR.
MARTIN, a Lombard Street banker, P.P. to form a “Railway
Travellers' Protection Society,” based on the article. What strikes
us is the superfluousness of the leading idea suggested by the title.
How can there be an opening for Railway Passengers to “do for
themselves,” considering the vast variety of ways in which the
Railway Companies “do for them.” P

He instanced a case, where, after touching an old Chief-
tain's heart with some Christian philanthropy, the old
Chieftain, having mastered his emotion, offered to sell
| own son for a spade. Perhaps the son wasn't much
of a fellow after all, and SIR SAMUEL, had he accepted
the offer, might have found that, in exchange for a useful
spade, he only received a stupid spoon, - - - -
Let SIR SAMUEL come and preach to the old Chieftains
and Chieftainesses in the West End, during the Season.
There is, in our Mºjº a large traffic in sons and

EFFECTS OF THE FOG.
BESIDEs killing numbers of the beasts assembled at the Cattle-
Show, the fog last week, occasioned, many, singular mishaps, some of
which may turn out serious. By the zeal of our reporters, we can
here record a few of them:— -
MR. FLITTERTON_made an abortive attempt to shoot the moon
under cover of the darkness. But his f dlord appeared suddenl
with a ºl. at his heels, and MR. FLITTERTON abandoned .
idea of lunar sporting.
MR. Dodge declined to meet a bill drawn, payable at sight,
*** that the fog made it impossible to see it.
. JqLI190CK was discovered by his anxiqus wife a long while
after midnight, vainly trying with his latch-key to § the front
door. He stated for excuse that the fog was sho shoth-hio- tha'he
c-couldn sheekeyhole,
MR, SHIRKER found the º for his #siness
day at b ds
that he stayed prudently at
with his pretty cousin Polly.
Rs. Lynx found a Policeman on duty in her area, and was told
he thought it right during the fog, as there were many thieves
about, to keep a close : on her premises.
MR. PHEEBLE tried his best to pop the question to Miss GAD-
ABOUT, but the fog, so choked his utterance that, when he had
screwed his courage to the popping point, he found himself unable
to stammer out a syllable.
MASTER Nobppeby indulged in a pipe at his Aunt's, trusting that
the smoke would not be smelt in such foul atmosphere.
B. CLYFAKE did a fairish stroke of business in the fog, by help-
ing timid people to find their way about, while he helped himself by
finding his own way into their pockets.
Miss McFLIRTER somehow managed in the fog to miss her party at
the Cattle-Show, and was gallantly escorted home by CAPTAIN SLI-
Boots, to whom she is engaged now.
MR. Jones's mother-in-law contrived under cover of the darkness
to pay his house a visit, and is now quite comfortably quartered for
some six weeks on his larder.
MR, LARKINGTON, in the fog, tied a string across the pavement
from the lamp-post to his neighbour's door-knocker, at an altitude
to catch the hats of ssers-by and project them on the pavement.

CHORAL.
To CARPENTERS and WHEELWRIGHTS.—A good CHURCH
SINGER is WANTED for a Small Willage; eight acres of Land.—
Apply by letter only, &c.
THIs is from a local paper, mot amongst the “Varieties” or the
“Facetiae,” but in the midst of the business advertisements. It may
fairly rank with the most ingenious Christmas puzzles and riddles.
Hitherto it has baffled the acutest intellects to which it has been
submitted, and defied the most vigorous understandings to unravel.
Why, asks the bewildered reader, in mingled accents of defeat and
despair, are Carpenters and Wheelwrights especially singled out as
likely to prove good Church ... Why is the preference given
to them over Attorneys and Solicitors, or Chemists and Druggists,
or Bricklayers and Masons? Is it because they are exceptionally
free from the taint of Nonconformity? Again, why the reference to
“eight acres of land?”, Will the fortunate carpenter or favoured
wheelwright be entitled to the rent they bring in as his yearly
stipend, or will his musical services be acknowledged by permission
to "cultivate these eight acres free of charge or tax, or will they
become his property, his own absolute freehold in fee simple for
ever, if he gives satisfaction in the village choir P -
Such are a few of the questions which this unique advertisement
suggests, and up to the hour of going to press nothing º:
to a satisfactory answer to them had been offered. Perhaps when
the fog has flºº, the intellect may recover itself, and be able to
grapple with “To Carpenters and Wheelwrights.” It was wise to
restrict the applicants to letters, otherwise such a levy of carpenters
and º all singing at the top of their voices, and bent on
viewing the eight acres, might have burst upon the “small village”

TEMPERANCE TAXATION.
FANCY a society of compulsory Teetotallers meeting in a public-
house. Fact. On Monday evening, last week, “the ndon
Auxiliary of the United Kingdom Älliance” held their annual
meeting at the Cannon Street Hotel. Of what magnitude soever, a
public-house is a public-house. Cordial and invigorating liquors were
consumed under the same roof as that which extended over the set
of meddlers assembled to conspire for the p se of depriving other
people of those comforts. The usual cant having been vented by
various declaimers,
“MR. J. H. RoPER moved a resolution, which urged that it was the duty
of all temperance electors to bring their influence to support those Candidates
who were willing, by their votes in Parliament, to give to every district, the
}. of self-defence against the pauperism, crime, and taxation, resulting
rom the liquor traffic.”
This resolution is one unusually good of its kind. Temperance
electors are therein invoked to support Candidates prepared to vote
for a law which will tend to destroy the liquor traffic, in order that
through its destruction §§ may get themselves defended from the
taxation which, amongst other evils, results from it. This is capital.
The Working Classes, almost entirely untaxed, except as to their
liquors, voluntarily tax themselves by consuming them, and thus
“drank us out of, the , Alabama, difficulty.” Some twenty-eight
millions of optional and insensible taxation accrue to the Revenue
from the consumption of exhilarating liquors. Therefore, vote for
Candidates who will vote for a law }. the consumption of
those liquors will be put an end to. o that wise thing to defend
yourselves from the taxation resulting from the liquor traffic. A
hopeful step to self-defence from taxation, truly, for everybod
who pays Income-tax! If the United Kingdom Alliance succeede
in destroying the liquor trade, would they wish the abolition of
excise to be replaced by increased duties on tea and sugar, and not
on the contrary, shout for the swindle of a “free breakfast table” }
Would they have the hole which they desire to get made in the
Revenue stopped by direct or indirect taxation ? Whichever method
of ways and means were adopted, it would be an addition to the
taxes of all electors who do not contribute to drink the nation out of
its expenses; and those are the electors invited to vote for Candi-
dates such as SIR WILFRID LAwson, and his “Band of Hope,” in
order to defead themselves from the taxation which they are subject
to already. The tax-paying electors will,*...*. rather elect to
bear the taxation which they have, partial and heavy as that is,
than fly to other, which they know will be much worse, by electing
the nominees of the United Kingdom Alliance. To the Allies against
the freedom of the United Kingdom, the eye of the tax-payer must
present an appearance of verdure. A great deal will be patent in
reality there, if, after reading such a resolution as that above-
quoted, every taxable person do not immediately pass a counter-
resolution, in his own mind, by all means carefully to vote against
any Candidate of theirs.
THE LABOUR MARKET.
“MILLINERs WANTED, mourning and coloured.”
MoURNING Milliners, we presume, are sought for, as likely from a
feeling of sympathy arising from their own recent bereavement, to
display greater care and industry in the preparation of all the
deeper descriptions of female mourning apparel. The demand for
Coloured Milliners is not so easily explain . persons of the
Negro or Mulatto type, who have gained a knowledge of millinery
and dressmaking in their own genial country, and then made a voy-
e to follow their calling in England, must befew and far between,
#. “angels' visits,” or unexpected legacies. So far as we have
been able to pursue the inquiry, there is no lady in the circle of our
acquaintance whose experience can point to more than the rarest
examples of such a phenomenon.
Perhaps one of the learned Societies, the Statistical or the Anthro-
pological, will take up the investigation, and by their researches
throw light on a subject which is wrapped in obscurity.

FARADAY, know the close relations of magnetic and electric action,
soi. wonder if the tea that so exhibits the one should produce the
other.
Then again iron is a well-known tonic, and it is only natural that,
taken into the system in large doses of morning and afternoon tea, it
should brace up the nerves and stimulate the blood. But, as we
have a right to ask that coffee-drinkers should be allowed to buy
their chicory and their coffee apart and mix for themselves, so we
think ladies in want of a pick-me-up should be allowed to ºhibitº
their tea and their iron separately. They would thus have a chance
of ascertaining how much of the bracing effect they claim for the
tea is due to the theine, and how much to the iron-filings so liber-
ally mixed with it. And thus the divine Thea—a goddess and beye
of goddesses—and tonic iron, would each, as vegetables and minerals
ought to do, stand on their own merits; and the ladies of England
be no longer doctored in disguise by the “Heathen Chinee;” for it
appears that these adulterations come from John CHINAMAN,
prompted, it is true, by the demand of our markets for showy
;: at impossible prices, and not from JoHN BULL, except in
his capacity of tempter.
RIGHT ROYAL PRESENTS.
THE DUKE and DUCHESS OF HAMILTON.—their two Graces—must
have been really delighted with the overpoweringly, handsome
Wºlf Gifts, presented by Home and Foreign Royalties. The
list would be incomplete without the following particulars:-
From H.I.M. the EMPERoR of GERMANY., a pleasing Photograph
of His Imperial Self (price 10 s. gr. apiece—a large reduction made
on taking a quantity), in a neat and tinsel-gilt frame and glass
complete, valued at 100 cents. French money.
From His Majesty the KING OF BAvARIA, a Tune of his own Royal
Composition, arranged by HERR WAGNER for the Wiolin, and written
on one sheet of printed music-paper. Unique.
From the SULTAN, a quarter of a pound of real Turkish Tobacco,
with the motto round the tin-can, “Many Happy Returns.”
From the KHEDIvá, one Share in a new Speculation of LESSEPs'.
Nothing #. up. First call in January, 1874.
ºm ING WICTOR-EMMANUEL, his Royal Autograph, postage not
pald.
Grace's becoming a citizen in a United Sta
From H.I.M. the EMPERoR of ALL THE RUssías, Note-Book,
bound in real Russian.
But what’s in the value of a Present? Nothing. 'Tis the hearti-
ness wherewith 'tis given. So, three cheers for the Duke and the
Duchess, and, like the hero and heroine of a fairy story, may they
“live happily ever after.”
From the American President, Congratulations (by wire) on his
te.
Nine to One.
WE are indebted to a country journal for making us acquainted
with the existence of an “Amalgamated Tailors' Society.” This
looks like a confirmation of what we have hitherto been accustomed
to regard as a vulgar error and popular delusion; namely, that nine
Tailors make a Man.

BUTTS AND BOBBIES.
HE time is now fast approach-
ing when the guardians of
public order, under the dimi-
intº Bobbies” will be
held up to derision on the
stage. This is as it should
be, if Christmas is a season
in which there is any pecu-
liarity rendering it fit to be
celebrated with outrageous
buffoonery, Besides, bur-
lesque is based on venera-
tion, and polieemen are made
of just as we parody
ShakspeaRE.
It is not likely that the
gomplaints which have lately
been alleged against the
conduct of the police wi
effect any diminution of the
extent to which the Force
will be introduced into the
forthcoming pantomimes. In
some be feared

foundation, and the mis-
- behaviour of exceptional
officers may possibly be attributed to a change for the worse in
the authority by which they are regulated. It may, how-
ever, have a different, or at least another cause. Reeent legislation
has rendered this once free nation a grievously police-ridden people.
The police have been constituted a sort of préfects of public-fiouses.
They are #: to enforge petty regulations on the publie at º:
gates, and intrusted with an amount of arbitrary power which has
naturally tended to inflate them. Very much has been done to
º them in the same relation to the people at large as that of
eadles to little boys. Thus, in fact, Bobby has, in some instances,
become exceedingly puffed up. The only wonder is that they are
not more numerous.
Of course the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN may be trusted to take care
that the jocularities of the Clown and Pantaloon with respect, or
disrespect, to the Police, shall not exceed the bounds which ought
to limit the excitement of mirth at the expense of Society's pre-
seryers. ...That reverence for a policeman, . oreigners sneer at
and Englishmen cherish, must not be outraged. is feeling prompts
a suggestion which some illustrious personage will perhaps adopt
the next time he presides at a º dinner, by taking occasion to
say that our constables are social soldiers, and, accordingly, to pro-
pose the toast of “The Army, Navy, and Police.”
TALK OF A TUNNEL!
“The French Conseil and Rapporteurs of the project of a Tunnel under
the Channel between France ...? England, lately entertained the English
engineer and Directors of the Company for carrying out this great under-
taking, at a splendid *: at Boulogne.”—News of the Day.
“MR. PREstwich lately read before the Geological Society a º on the
geological conditions of the strata between the French and English shores,
with reference to the feasibility of a tunnel under the Channel.”—Scientifie
Report of the Week.
WELL, you are §. people
HAwksHAw, GRosvenor, St Co.,
With your grave scheme of a Tunnel
'Neath the Channel sea to go!
Yes, a bond fide Tunnel
"Twixt Cape Grisnez, say, and Dover,
To carry bond fide
French and English traffie over !
We thought it was a bubble
To be blown and then to burst,
After the usual offering
Of eapital at first.
But behold a serious project
- Of a serious engineer,
- And for capital a Lºrdling
Of the House of Westminstére!—
Westminstère, whose head should
Be something like a nob,
With a rent roll (when fall leases!)
Of two millions, if a bob
But e'en that mighty rent-roll
Drained dry methinks will be,
E'er they have run this Tunnel
Beneath the Channel sea.
Spite of Chairmen and Committees,
Conseil and Rapporteurs,
These papers and these dinners
And all this fuss and stir,
Though HAwksHAw, and LoRD GRosvenoR,
At Boulogne they have dified
Have toasted them and buttered,
And spoke all but their mind–
Drank good-speed to the Tunnel
'Neath the silver streak of sea—
As well he may that wishes
With England to make free—
And making free with England—
Stript of her wall of waves—
Means—what thus far they've failed in-
Of Britons making slaves.
So please let's keep the Channel,
nd the waves we’ve learnt to rule,
And with Fº of a Tunnel
Don't let us play the fool.
Sea-sickness is a nuisance,
In a Channel—sea and squall,
But better sea that sickens,
Thán ne'er a sea at all.
All Britons know the blessings
e owe that silver streak;
Or let the ass who doesn't
Hear Father Neptune speak.
“'Tis like you British donkeys,
Fºll. to make away,
With the § your breast that's guarded
Since my trident hath held sway.
“The wall that keeps your borders,
Still sacred from the foe;
akes your isle an asylum,
Girt with my faithful flow;
Of wars and woes of Europe,
Bars out the baleful stress;
Goes far to make your Britain,
The Britain Britons bless.
“Nor Britons most, or loudest,
For all that are opprest,
Of all shades, in succession,
Within my guard find rest.—
But if I went on yarning,
All day from ebb to flow,
I could not sum the comforts
You to your Channel owe.
“And 'tis this source of blessings,
Which at your door I lay,
That I hear these wiseacres
Propose to do * !
Well, my hearties, there's one comfort,
Long though their º: may be,
Through it they will have tunnelled,
Ere they have tunnelled me!”

Thirdly.--In the neighbourhood of St. Paul's and the Bank, where
the traffic, like the Fog, is at its thickest, let care be taken to secure
the absence of all light and all Police. šurely everyone who is out

AN EDUCATED GIRL.
R. PUNCH,
You have heard
two Ladies, now per-
haps you may be so
ood as to hear me.
he following is a re-
port of a dialogue
which induced me to
think that one of the
parties to it would
make a suitable wife
for the other, Iregret
to inform you that
the result of the step
taken by the latter has
been altogether un-
satisfactory. Sir, the
Lady can talk very
fluently, very imperti-
nently, and very fool-
º y Tº not, for an
obvious reason, give
our names, but I bor-
row those of agentle-
man and another per-
son made famous by
BEN Jonson,
Yours diseontentedly,
UNCLE: MoRose.
SCENE–A large Dinner Party. MR. MoRose has taken down Miss
EPIcoeNE, having been introduced to her ten minutes before,
* I hope that you have room. (Sotto voce.) We are closely
packed.
Epicoene. Thanks. Plenty.
Morose (to himself, as he reads the menu). What am I to say to
her? She’s nineteen, and I'm fifty! e've a deal in common.
However, I must say *..."; I suppose. (To her.) They hardly
wanted a fire to-day. I hope that you do not mind being so near
it. Shall I ask for a screen for you
Epicoene (in a quiet roice, preserred throughout). Thank you, no;
I do not mind it.
Morose. Have you been to see the play they were talking about
up-stairs—the adaptation from BEN Jonson's Silent Woman 2
Epicane. We govery little to theatres.
orose. A sign of good taste in your family, for no rational per-
son can take much interest in the stage in its present condition. I
do not know which is worst, the plays, the acting, or the criticism.
Fpicoene. No, indeed.
orose. What does she mean by that? And what does MRs.
BLIBBER mean by giving me a goose of a girl to sit by ? (To her.)
Those engravings are not bad, on that wall. They are from pictures
in the Dresden Gallery. Perhaps you know them—have you been
to Dresden P
Epicoene. No, never,
orose. Travelled on the Continent much? People go about so
much now that everybody has been everywhere.
Epicacne. We travel very little.
orose. Then you are to be congratulated, because you have all
#. more to look forward to, and there is no pleasure like anticipa-
10n.
Bpicane. I suppose so.
orose. I should like to give her a good slap. And yet I
shouldn't, for she is certainly very Prºy, d vou don't see that
sleepy kind of eye every day. She's like what Rosa CHARGEs was
in 1845, and isn't, now, by Joye. For Rosa's sake I'll give her
another chance. (To her.) I noticed signs of a severe musical even-
ing by-and-by. Do you sing P
Epicoene. A little. Chiefly to please Papa.
orose. Come, that's a good trait in her. Then perhaps you do
not care violently for going to Qperas, and all that sort of thing. ..
..". Not much. I would rather read to Papa, and hear his
remarks.
Morose (to himself). That I like. She has sense and is º
I will encourage her. An exceedingly kind as well as exceedi

d 'picane. It does not deserve admiration. Surely, it is only my
uty.
* And, I am sure, a pleasure. Your Papa is much to be
envied.
#. Ah! but he is so , so kind.
. Morose. Goodness and kindness do not always ensure the affec-
tion and gratitude of the young. I have myself found—(to himself)
—what the deuce was I going to be idiot enough to say? I have
myself seen that parental fondness is not always rewarded as it
should be.
Epicane. Surely yes, where children have been properly trained:
orose. A very sensible girl indeed, a very right-hearted girl,
and I thought she was a goose. But I have made mistakes once or
twice in my life. (To her.) You do not live in town, I think?
Epicoene. At dear, quiet Clapham.
orose. Ah, you like quiet P
Epicane. Dearly. I own to liking a little º and flowers;
but even if I could not have those, I hope I could be content.
Morose. This is a she-Phoenix. But stop, stop—no fool like an
old fool—well, I’m not old, but when, we begin to admire at fifty

to your Papa? Novels, I suppose,
}. O no. Except SfR WALTER's and MIss EDGEworth's,
*: few. He likes thoughtful books, and he teaches me to like
em.
Morose. If I do not ask too many questions, would you mention a
book or two?
Epicoene. We have gone together through Lord MACAULAY, CAR-
LYLE, all SIR ARTHUR HELPs' works, FROUDE, and many others,
and he is kind enough to point out meanings to me, and beauties
that would escape me.
Morose...I gań imagine nothing more, charming to a man of
advanced life being so assisted by a young lady, and in return giving
her the benefit of #. reading and experience.
Epicane. But it must be somebody whom she eares very much
about, and implicitly trusts.
Morose. Yes, a father, as in your case, or a much elder brother,
or a husband—only a husband of such a different age does not come
in among the things young ladies dream of tolerating.
Epicane. Perhaps you have known more .#". ladies than I have.
But º one who has a father like mine would wish her husband to
resemble him, and would hardly feel sufficient respect for a much
younger man. -
orose, I have seldom or never heard a wiser sentiment, and I
must i. make an effort to become acquainted with such a father.
Is he here -
Epicane. That is he, dear old flºº on MRs. BLIBBER's right—
he took her down; she is very fond of him. -
Morose. I will ask her to introduce me, or manage to do it for
myself when we come to claret. -
Epicane. You will like him so much, and if you talk to him about
old books, 3. will win his heart.
Morose. They happen to be a slight craze of mine. What does
§ friend, SIR WALTER, º “Old wood to burn, old wine to
ink, old books to read, and o d friends, yes, and young friends, to
converse with.”
#. I remember that, in the Antiquary.
Morose. Have you a good memory? -
Epicoene. Not what I wish it were, but I try to remember things.
orose. Try to remember—you see you are called away—that
you made a not very young man say, and say truly, that he never
so much regretted that the shortness of a dinner—.

to be able to bear that, if not to conquer it. ( tº: We have

picoene. No, dear. I told him, &c. &c.

Bopular Advancement.
A HEADING very commonly prefixed to newspaper pººl. is
that of “Temperance Movement.” It naturally suggests the oppo-
site idea of “Intemperance” movement; namely, that of advancing,
like a besieging army, in a zigzag line. This, happily, is now muc
less frequently observable in the streets than it once was; a fact
which must be gratifying to all friends of genuine progress.

Uplifted over india's cowering head,
And their black shadow broad'ning, vast yet vague,
More awful for the doubt blent with the dread!
Between the cloudless heavens, like brass, on high,
And the baked earth, as iron hard, below,
From Ryot's *::: Viceroy's, every eye
Wanders, athirst, for rain that will not flow.
How many woful watchers through the land
Pray in his hope, that saw, from Carmel's brow,
Rise from the sea a cloud like a man's hand,
That brought black clouds and wind and rain enow!
Till many hearts are loosed with a great fear,
And many hardened with a dark despair:
'Tis hard to see God's love and leading clear,
Athwart this foodless earth and parching airl
Yet sure His love is working, in the glow
of brotherhood that stirs the nation's heart,
In the resolve of all men, high and low,
With hand or brain or purse to bear their part—
That none, whom we can feed, unfed shall go,
No life, that care of ours can save, be lost;
That e'en if purblind doctrine thrust her “ No”
On helping hands, we will not count the cost,
But stoutly press, with wealth's and wisdom's aid,
Betwixt poor India and His doom of dearth,
Knowing great means for great occasions made,
And power God-given to show man's helpful worth.
And when this misery has past away,
And men look back upon this year of woe,
As now on famines of an earlier day
Some seeds of good, sown now, and ripening slow,
May blossom into blessings unforeseen;
Some work now set on foot such fruit may bear,
That men to come may see how it hath been—
Love in the grim mask that now looks despair.

OCCASIONAL HAPPY THOUGHTS.
UDDENLY to TROTT, when
we are once more in the
gig : “Now, what is the
matter with that Cow?”
I put this to him confi-
dentially, as much as to
say, “Look here. Now
I’m driving about with
you I'm one of yourselves;
and, entre nous, though
you told, FLIPSTER some-
thing about that Cow,
du id: tell him every-
hing. Now then, TROTT
my boy, out with it, and
mum's the word.” -
I think he is taken with
my confidential air, as he
inclines his head sideway,
still keeping his eye in a
hiº sort of way on
the careless mare, and,
without, turning to me,
he replies almost in a
whisper
*Well, Sir, my idea is
that it's apoplexy.”
I look at him to see if
he's joking. I am pre-
pared to laugh if he is,
and am ready to say "In-
deed!” quite seriously,
- if he isn't,

Answer—When you’re “in the vein.” Arrange this.] I ask TRoTT,
“Can a Cow have the Chicken-pox?”
“Well,” says TRott, deliberately, and for a second taking his
eyes off the horse to look at me, only without turning his head—a
movement of which the careless animal seems perfectly aware, as he
takes that º of making such a stumble as very nearly
brings him dºwn, whereupon I interrupt TROTT, to say, in a sur-
rised tone, “Hulloa ' ' to intimate that TROTT ought really to hold

Of course I have; but, at this minute, I can't recollect when of

so I reply to Thorº, as though a new light had broken in upon me,

him at the careless horse's ears, that I cannot see whether he is

smiling, why does he smile?
I know, and at the same time I arrive at the reason of his compa-
rative reticence on the subject of animals and, their peculiarities.
This branch of knowledge is his stogk-in-trade, to gain which he
has had to attend Horsey, Cowy, and Piggy Lectures, to pass an
examination, and come out with a degree.
Happy Thought.—“B.A.”—Bachelor of Animals.
. Or, if not with a degree, with a Diploma. Well, all this has cost
him mºney, and, evidently; why should he give me, gratis, because
I’m riding in a gig with him, such information on Horses, Cows,
and other quadrupeds, as would enable me (after one drive with
him, with a note-book and a good memory) to set up as a Wet in a

Could I expect a Solicitor to give me his opinion ? Wouldn't he
be justified in replying, “No, my dear friend, if you are in want of
six-and-eightpence, here it is, but I keep my opinion to myself.”
Could I expect a Barrister to give me the benefit of his experience?
or a Doctor P
No, I am convinced that questions, put to a professional man, in a
†y and confidential way, on purely professional matters, are
unfair.
Though, for the above-mentioned reasons, which I fairly think
out to myself as we drive along, I am going to drop the subject, yet
I can't help inquiring,<
"Is it ºnly short-necked animals that are subject to apoplexy?”
I feel that it is an unfair question for me to put, as it really might
have been one of the chief tests in MR. TRott's examination papers
when he was a Veterinary Student.
Giving the loose reins a slight check, he returns,—
“Short-necked, or short-horned?”
Short-necked, f meant; but, if I'm wrong—
“Yes,” he says, “all short-necked'uns—Bulls, Cows, and sheep.”
{ſº} Thought.—Not Giraffes, then f They're well out of the
wº of apoplexy.
suggest this to MR. Thott, who seems to look at me sideways for
! º , and then, distinctly, smiles, as if this were something new
0 Illin.
. After 'all, he has not, lost by his information, as I've presented
hº with an idea, of which he can make what use he pleases. On it
emight build up a Theory, on the Theory a Practice; then call at
the Zoological Gardens, mention Giraffes and apoplexy before a
Committee meeting, and be elected Special Surgeon and Medical
Attendant-in-Chief to the Zoological Collection. Then there would
be an additional attraction besides “Feeding Time,” which might
be (well advertised) “Medicine Time.”
However, the point now is to talk about CLUMBER and his horse
before we get to CLUMBER's.
“CLUMBER's honest and straightforward,” says TROTT; “I’ve
never heard anything against him.” He admits so much, as though
there might be ºff not to CLUMBER's knowledge, which had
not, as yet, reached his (TROTT's) ears.
“But,” continues MR. TRoTT, “when it's about a horse I wouldn't
trust my own father.”
“That’s why I called you in,” I say, complimenting MR. TROTT's
professional skill and my own cleverness. "Connecting my answer
with TROTT's previous observation, I am aware that I seem to repre-
sent CLUMBER as my father, or something like it.
f -- }}} 're quite right, Sir,” says TRott. “What does he want
or it
ºrty, I think—at least, judging from what MR. SpokER
Sald. -
“Um!'” says MR.T.Rott. “If he's a good’un, at that price it’s
a bargain. If he ain’t, there must be º precious queer
about him, and it 'ud be a dead loss of the money, besides danger to
life and limb,”
“Quite so.” My sentiments to a turn.
“Does CLUMBER expect me?” asks MR. TRott.
“No, he doesn't.” TMR. TROTT smiles. “The fact is,” I go on,
“it only occurred to me to come to you about it this morning.”
I am about to, what the lawyers call, “spring ”TROTT on CLUM-
BER. Here we are.

What’s the news from Ashantee?
For Politics I care not.—
Hang the Trial of BAzAINE .

And the º: from Spain!
This is no time for trifling:—
All our prices may increase; , .
All my friends be smashed on Railways,
Or abused by the Police'
I am one whose business habits
Cannot dull his martial soul;
And my ardour burns within me–
It’s a substitute for Coal!
Though my scuttle may be empty,
I imagine in my glee
A vicarious perspiration
When I read of Ashantee!
For there no dreaded enem
Brings Science to the fight;
No needle-guns to shoot our sons
Before they are in sight;
But cheap and nasty weapons
(How I love to think of them.')

Of time-serving Brummagem!
And the greatest satisfaction
In our modern British eyes
Is, to think we're only hitting
At a man not half our size.
So our Walour is Discretion;
We can boldly cross the sea,
Send out our Cracks to make the Blacks
Behave in Ashanteel
Through the land the tale is thrilling
Of the Stores so thickly sent
(Let the cargoes all be useless,
But our money must be spent)–
Many thousand bales of blankets
Are suggested by the wise,
And unnumbered pairs of trousers,
To impede our bare Allies;
Traction-Engines, that with whistle
Shall strike terror to our foes,
And some fifty tons of pokers
Are thrown in by “One Who Knows.”
Twice a hundred miles of Railway,
When our Troops would onward push,
Neatly packed in pic-nic baskets,
To be laid down in the Bush.
A small fleet of patent lifeboats
To be used across the plains,
If advance should be retarded
By the unexpected rains.
Worsted comforters, goloshes,
Strapless skates of newest plan,
Kalydor to give our soldiers
An immunity from tan!
Of all that Art can furnish,
Of all that Wealth can buy,
We’ll have no lack—against the Black
We'll not work niggerdly;
Load all our ships to fulness!
Send out any one but me!
At home in bed I'll back the Red
To win in Ashantee!
Twaddle not to me of fevers,
Of malaria on the plains;
Even here in modern London
We have trouble with our drains.
You may prate of savage cunning,
Urge KING CoFFEE is no fool,
Make much §. this Black sheep,
And respect his §§ wool;
It is easy (from this distance
Which lends strength to all my views)
To upset his pig-stye palace,
Burn his city of bamboos—
Where this f. Imperial Savage
Boasts Palm-oil his end in life—
And for sceptre wields a thigh-bone
Of a late lamented wife;
Where his babies ply for rattle
Fantee ribs, as ready toys,
And the skulls of conquered chieftains
Are the footballs of his boys!
Is the picture black I’ve painted?
Do you doubt the likeness true?
Go! and judge yourselves, my heroes!
That’s the work I leave to you.
For Improvement is the motto
That rules mankind to-day

REVIVAL FOR RAILWAYS.
THE Railway Accident at Wigan has been ascribed by a Coroner's Jury to the system of management
W. on the London and §º. Line. Yet the Directors of the London, and North-
estern Company inform the claimants of compensation for injuries thence received that they-
“Have i. the matter their best consideration, and deeply sympathise with the sufferers; but as they cannot see
that any blame is attached to them, they decline to entertain any ºl. made to them for compensation, and
further, that they have instructed their solicitors to defend any action brought against them.”
The verdict of a Coroner's Jury may convey a groundless imputation, and the London and North-
Western Company's Directors, when they assert that they are not to blame for the Wigan accident,
. say what is true. Which of these two possibilities is the case another Jury will decide if any
sufferer is bold enough to try conclusions at law with a wealthy Confederacy: Litigation on questions
of this kind wouldº; be lessened by a partial re-enactment, with a little modification, of the old
law of deodand. Under that law anything of the nature of property which had been instrumental,
though casually, to the death of a human being, became forfeit to the Crown.
If therefore, a passenger train .# into a goods train had killed any person or persons, the
goods train and the passenger train would both have been forfeited, the passenger train for having run
into the goods train, and the goods train for having been in the way. Suppose deodand were so far re-
established as the commutation of the forfeiture for a sum of money, to |. assessed, in every case of
fatal Railway Accident, by a Coroner's Jury, and divided amongst the kindred of the slain. Then,
perhaps, Railway Accidents, fatal or not, would soon become very considerably less frequent than they
are now, and consequently the cases in which unfortunate persons would have to sue Railway Com-
anies, in order to wring compensation from them for maims and mutilations, would be very much
ewer.

A REAL BLOCK SYSTEM.
It has been proyed that Railway Accidents for the most part are
preventible, and it is believed that what is thought to be economy
}. the introduction of such preventive measures as might
ead to their decrease. In autumn time especially the Signal-men
and Engine-drivers are too often worked to death, and the loss of
life which follows is not merely their own, but that of sundry of the
public, whose fate it is to travel by the trains under the guidance
of these over-worked officials. The engines, too, break down, being
also worked to death, and when the line is blocked in this way a
fast train rattles up, and carriages are smashed, and people who are
in them. . To. put on extra servants, or to keep a closer eye on the
rolling stock, would doubtless cost some money, and decrease the
rate of dividend; so the Directors, in their wisdom, decide to run
the risk of haying to pay damages for accidents, so called, which are
the fruit of their economy. Mere flesh and blood weighs nothing
in their selfish estimation, and while they think it pays to work
their line on the chean and deadly system, we may be certain they
will stick to it, regardless of the suffering and sorrow it may bring.
But cannot Parliament protect us? some poor innocents may .#
Why, yes-of course, it can; but that it won't is pretty clear, so
long as some three hundred of its Members are Directors of our
Railways, and band together in a body to squelch any endeavour to
obtain railway reform. If the public wish for this, we may wish
that they may get it, but, with the present House of Commons, we
fear they have small chance of it. When the general election
comes, let them bear the fact in mind, and, when canvassed for
their votes, say, No Director Need Apply.

PRETERNATURAL PROCEEDINGS /
CONVERSION OF A THIEF :
AINDNESS OF A PROSECUTOR /
GENTLENESS OF A JURY |
MERCY IN A MAGISTRATE :
GRATITUDE IN THE GUILTY :
LAST week, at the Surrey Sessions, before MR. HARDMAN, Chair-
man, WILLIAM BRoad was charged with stealing two half-sovereigns,
the property of his master, MR. GoDw1N-AUSTEN, of Shalford House,
Surrey. It .. that many complaints had been made of losses
by visitors and others staying in MR. Godwin-AustEN's house, and
therefore, under direction of a detective, marked money was put
into a pocket-book, which was left in a room to which the prisoner
had access. Later, the marked money was found in BRQA5's bºx.
The culprit was defended, but his advocate had scarcely begun his
speech when,
—“without any warning, the prisoner fell violently on the floor of the dock
in a fit. His struggles were yery severe, and it took several persons to hold
him. The surgeon of the prison not being at hand, the Chairman directed
the nearest doctor to be sent for, and adjourned the Court. .
“At the expiration of three-quarters of an hour the prisoner was suffi-
ciently recovered to admit of the case going on. He then expressed, through
his eounsel, a wish to withdraw his plea and plead guilty, throwing himself
on the mercy of the Court. -
“The jury recommended him to ". and MR. Godwin-AUSTEN said he
had only prosecuted the prisoner on pu lic grounds, and expressed .#
his ºnot to press hardly on the prisoner, who was an orphan, and who
recently lost his sister, which loss had affected him #. -
“The Chairman said that, taking into consideration all the circumstances,
the age of the prisoner, and the recommendations to mercy, he thought the
justice of the case would be met by a sentence of three months. .
“The prisoner, who had evidently anticipated a very much heavier sentenee,
was then removed.”
The above dramatic, suggestive, and affecting scene would be in-
teresting in itself. But, when we give one of the answers of a
witness, and show how all these miraculous results were produced,
and what influence threw the prisoner (for his good) into a fit,
turned his heart and made him penitent, bade the benevolent prose:
cutor intercede for him, the jury recommend him, to mercy, and
softened the excellent magistrate's heart, causing him tº astonish
the guilty one with a mild sentence, the universe will indeed be
ecstatic.
MR. ALFRED Godwin-AustEN (son of the prosecutor) said that it
was in his pocket-book that the marked money was placed.
“By MR HARDMAN-The pocket-book was not usually kept in the drawer.
I carry it about with me. IT IS A PUNCH's POCKET-B00K.”
Comment would be an insult to all who are capable of appreciating
supernatural agencies, and who will instantly rush forth and pur-
chase Punch's Pocket-Book for 1874. [Advertisement.

PHILOSOPHY FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
TRICTLY in pursuance of an
arrangement made with
him by the Council of the
Society of Arts, MR. FRANK
BUCKLAND,-intends to de-
liver, in the beginning of
January, a short course
of lectures, for juvenile
hearers exclusively, “On
the Structure and Habits
of Beasts, Birds, and
Fishes, as showing Beauty
and Design.” An accom-
plished naturalist will not
fail to both instruct and
entertain a youthful audi-
ence, in pointing out ex-
amples of beauty and de-
sign in the habits as well
as in the structure of the
lower creatures. He will
doubtless be able to adduce
plenty. Arethere as many
instances of design and
beauty, discernible by a
competent philosopher, not
only in the structure but
likewise in the habits of a
higher race? Its structural
beauties, especially as ex-
hibited in the female face
and form, are numerous no
doubt, and the habits of
human beings of the softer
sex, in the sense of personal
ways and usages are, some
of them, beautiful in so far
as they are fascinating.
Design, too, is exemplified
not less in their habits, as
above considered, than in
manifest beauty and design to the meanest
capacity. But, in respect to their habits and structures considered as apparel, what is to be said about design and beauty? For instance,
wherein is the beauty, and what is the design, of long habits which draggle in the dust? and what design and what beauty can
be made out in that structure of false hair, shreds, and patches, called a “chignon’?
likely, and apparently a design to captivate, a native of that description.

A course of lectures on “Beauty and Design, as con-

FROST AND FOLLY.
FROST came, and straightway ice began
To form on ponds and pools.

Of skating, saved some fools.

A month, and maybe more.

And they will tumble in.

TO THE KITCHEN.
WE recommend to the notice of all domestic servants a, work
entitled Not to be Broken. They like a novel. Let them read this,
“...d ºw by their future conduct that they have profited by its
perusal.
PERAMBULATORS AND PEDESTRIANS.
It is said that a Deputation is being organised to wait upon the
FIRST CoMMIssionER of Works AND PUBLIC BUILDINGs, and, if
F. obtain from him the recall of the subjoined order, of which
e has caused notices to be posted on boards in all the walks and
avenues in Hyde Park leading into Rotten Row:—
“Bath chairs and perambulators may not be brought into these walks
between the hours of 4 P.M. and 7 P.M.”
A Deputation organised to remonstrate with a Minister against
the exclusion of Perambulators from public ways, º be supposed
to be one of a peculiar composition, consisting largely, if not entirely,
of ladies and nursemaids. Yet, if Perambulators are anywhere
compatible with the safety of pedestrians' toes and shins, it is in
the Parks. One would think that the walks in Hyde Park were
almost wide enough for them and their infant occupants. If the
are excluded from those paths, they ought, d fortiori, to be orde
off all the }. Otherwise, their exclusion from the ap-
proaches to Rotten Row will produce an effect like that of closing a
chapel-of-ease. Thus it will render them a greater nuisance in the
streets than ever. , Dangerously obstructive in any of the arteries,
they are comparatively innocuous in the lungs of London.
Wanted a Faculty.
DR. TRISTRAM has refused the application of the Vicar and
Churchwardens of St. Barnabas, Pimlico, for a faculty to erect a
“Baldacchino” in that Church. What those applicants really want
is a faculty to do nothing of the kind; that is, the faculty of

SITTINGS IN ERROR.
It may be jº by some people rather a grand thing to serve on
a Grand Jury; but that Grand Jurors themselves are not so very
much impressed by the grandeur of their service would appear from
the following memorial, which Mr Punch preserves as a condensed
essay on a question that affects a vast number of unfortunate but
otherwise respectable men:—
“The Grand Jury, assembled at the Quarter Sessions for the Borough
of Birmingham, respectfully represent that while recognising the duty
of every citizen to aid, regardless of inconvenience, in #. administration
of the law, whenever required, yet cannot terminate its labours on the present
occasion without expressing a very strong opinion that the time has arrived
when the functions of Grand Juries in large towns and districts should cease,
as having been long practically superseded by the full investigation in public
that invariably takes place i. competent magistrates, with the invaluable
aid of skilled legal advisers of both prosecutor and prisoner before them, and
before whom the evidence is thoroughly sifted and commitment thoroughl
weighed before being resolved upon. Contrasted with this, the unaid
Nº. and entirely one-sided investigation in the Grand Jury room, must
appear to every º mind as superfluous and unsatisfactory, relating
as it does to a state of society long since vanished and gone. The Grand Jury
therefore, cannot but feel that the loss of time most valuable to them involved
in their attendance here is not compensated by any real assistance that they
have given in the administration of justice. It may also be stated, on good
authority, that criminals have ever counted upon the difficulties Grand Juries
have to contend with in eliciting evidence as an important point in their
favour.”
There is, clearly, no º: the presence of good sense in this
jº. although there may be some s º doubt as to the presence
of good mar. But there is not the slightest doubt that, to
“every thoughtful mind,” the serving on a jury of any sort or kind
can rarely be regarded as being “satisfactory,” or, indeed, as being
anything except a horrid nuisance. It entails, in most cases, a
costly waste of time, and an alarming cost of temper; and although
a Special Juror may pride himself on having done the State a special
service, the odds are, after all, that, unlike the jury, the service is a
petty one. . A Grand Juror, however, not merely finds his work a
nuisance, but may well be fearful of its causing an injustice.
“Unaided, haphazard, and entirely one-sided,” his crim Inves-
tigation can hardly be considered a harmless superfluity. If rogues
and rascals can count upon the voice of a Grand Jury to favour
their escape from the punishment they merit, surely honest º:
shortly will come to the conclusion that the calling of Grand Juries
is a grand mistake.
CHRISTMAS-DAY FOLK-LORE.
If Christmas-Day falls on a Sunday, they say in Shropshire that
valuable pieces of Church preferment will become vacant during the
next twelve months.
If it falls on a Monday, there is a prevalent belief in the East
Riding of Yorkshire that the *ś. crop will be different from the
pear crop, and the cherry crop show a marked contrast to the plum
crop.
If it falls on a Tuesday, there is a common saying in Glamo -
shire that the emigration will be greater from Liverpool than from
Lowestoft.
If it falls on a Wednesday, it is impossible to
orders in Huntingdonshire that there will not
House of Commons before another year is out.
If it falls on a Thursday (as this year), every school-boy in North-
umberland knows that the Bank rate of Discount will be subject to
considerable fluctuations.
If it falls on a Friday, the old women in Suffolk nod their heads
and predict that a per-centage of the adult population will contract
unlucky marriages.
If it falls on a Saturday, you cannot shake the strong conviction
which runs through all the Home Counties that the Peerage will

ccording to the Morning Post, the
WENERABLE ARCHDEAC0N DENISON
- recently gave one of his highly cele-
brated imitations at the church of St. Ethelburga, Bishopsgate-
street, where “there was a high ritualistic ceremony, with incense,
banners, and processions; ” and MR. DENIson preached a sermon
on “confession,” maintaining that “it was most blissful and most
full of all peace.” The Post mentions that,
“When ºf of the joys of Heaven, which confession would secure
the ARCHDEAcon lifted up an elaborately embroidered stole, kissed it, and
then solemnly placed it around his neck.”
..It may,#. be º: that this bit of pantomime was a
little out-Heroding Herod, if we may venture to apply such a name
as Herod to the character of a Roman Catholic priest, of which the
original performer does not at least make a practice of kissing his
clothes. ARCHDEAcQN DENISON, however, must have all due credit
flºuintance with a part which he has no doubt carefully
studile(1.
If Dissenters were sufficiently liberal-minded, they might derive a
lesson in mutual toleration from ARCHDEAcon DENISQN's example.
None of them, that are at all orthodox, differ so widely as he does,
both as to doctrine and ritual, from the Protestant clergy of the
Church of England, in which, however, he is content to abide.
Why cannot they, then, conform to it as well as he does, and dissent
i. its principles and practice, within its pale, to any extent they
please.
CHINESE CAPERS.
SEVERAL Liverpool grocers have º been fined for selling tea
largely adulterated with steel-filings and sand. The public analyst
was of opinion that the adulteration was effected in &#.
The tea imported from British, India is, reported perfectly pure:
This is so far a comfort. We rejoice in that fact #: the sake of
the mild Hindoo, who grows, and the mis-used British consumer,
who has to drink. Let us all make a note. While we stick to the
owth of Assam and Katchar we are safe from such strange ingre-
ents in “the cup, that cheers, but not,” &c., as steel-filings
and Prussian blue, China clay and catechn.
The tea impounded at Liverpool was of the kind known in the
trade as Caper. It is somewhat comforting to know that this par-
ticular rascality may be called a Chinese caper. But how many
English º of the same order has the unhappy consumer still to
put up with !
If we could but see John BULL cutting such capers, we might put
up with all John CHINAMAN can do to prove himself more than a
match for English JoHN in the inglorious field of adulteration.
It is a bad race to enter for, and the worst of it is that the
Heathen Celestials' skill in this kind of swindling, and the British
Christians' run so nearly neck and neck, that it is impossible—all
Celestial capers to the contrary notwithstanding—honestly to pro-
nounce JoHN BULL a bit behind JoHN CHINAMAN in the race of
roguery. -
A BOLD RYDER.
“NAY, the deuce take those who cannot say a good word for
themselves,” retorts Miss, in Polite Conversation, when her lover
has credited himself with some merit. ADMIRAL RYDER BURTON
is in no danger from the gentle little “cuss” breathed by Miss
Notable. Having to defend himself from the charge of writing
some objectionable letters, the gallant Admiral, according to the
reports, incidentally mentioned that “from the earliest period of
is existence to the present time he had always borne a religious,
moral, and chivalrous character, and every Admiral or Captain
under whom he had served could and had certified that he was one
of the most gallant of officers, and an ornament to his profession.”
The ºf is aged, and has learned wisdom, and knows that when
Y. want a thing done well you should do it yourself. Ha! haſ
dmiral, Punch drinks off a can of flip to you, and is sorry that
you should be bothered in your old age. He remembers, you when
your jolly sailor voice rang out on the hustings, as no doubt it did
on your quarter-deck, and how boldly you then asserted your
individuality. Was there not some poetic version of one of your
speeches ending-
“None of your humbug, none of your shammy,
I'm CAPTAIN RYDER BURTON,-
#: so long ago that Mr. Punch forgets the rhyme. But he makes
is memorandum to show you how well he recollects old friends.
You have been wounded in your country's service, and he wishes
; yºu out of this botheration, however it may have been brought
adoult.
THE MASK OF HOME RULE.
LET us hope that Germany and Italy, respectively united and
combined together, may be º; and strong-looking enough to
deter France from going to war for an idea, with an object, and
from a motive—the idea of replacing the Pope on his temporal throne
the object of regaining Elsass and Lothringen, and the motive of
revenge. Then will not come to pass the º by
MR. DISRAELI at Glasgow, that “it may be open to England again
to take a stand upon the Reformation, which, three hundred years
ago, was the source of her greatness and her glory.” Nor, in that
case, will be realised the calamity which the RIGHT HoNour ABLE
BENJAMIN contemplated when he proceeded to say, that “our con-
nection with Ireland will then be brought painfully to our conscious-
ness, and I should not be at all surprised § the visor of Home Rule
should fall off some day, and you beheld a very different counten-
ance.” The visor of Home Rule is a very thin mask indeed, and
}. pellucid enough to be seen through already with half an eye.
reland does not want Home Rule for Home purposes; wants
nothing for those but subsidies and exemption from taxes. The
countenance behind the visor of Home Rule is a countenance that
lookstoforeign policy. , Granted the visor, it would drop off and show
the countenance behind it, on the first opportunity for making that
disclosure, to the detriment of England. *. foreign policy behind
the pretence of Home Rule is the policy of making common cause
with the United States in case of a quarrel between ourselves and
America, and it is the policy of sidin ainst this Protestant
§." with any Ultramontane Crusade that may break out in
urope.
CLANDESTINE MUNIFICENCE,
FROM a letter in the Times, bearing the signature of CHARLEs
OPPENHEIM, it appears that the statue of the late PRINCE CoNSoRT,
on the Holborn Wiaduct, is the gift of somebody unknown. Here is
a fact fit to..". a psychologist. One can understand the dis-
covery of bank-notes to any amount in a poor-box, they having
been put there, possibly, by a reasonable person. A logical but
literal understanding, combined with theological convictions, forms
indeed, º very condition which would account for secret and
unlimited almsgiving. But he that (as D.R., Johnson may be
imagined saying) clandestinely presents the public with a work of
Art, performs an act which, however munificent, is not one he can
hope to be rewarded for hereafter. As he gets neither fame nor
money by it, he puts himself to an expense for which he obtains no
reward here that is perceptible, sº may be supposed to
afford some minds a gratification which might repay anonymous
expenditure on the erection of a monument. But what sort of
minds P. Those, surely, of individuals possessed of money in a pro
portion much exceeding that of their brains.

HE butchers may or may not be pleased to hear that attempts
are in course of §: made to bring into consumption, besides
Australian meat, also frozen joints, and steaks preserved in a
liquid of which the nature has not as yet been disclosed.
There is some doubt whether this latter food will go down
with those inconsiderately called the poorer classes, who
refuse the meat which comes from Aus Referring
to the parts and pieces of beef, mutton, and pork, fresh-
killed, to which only they will vouchsafe to abase their
appetites, the Times observes:—
“The prejudice to be overcome before the mass of our º
will take to any description of meat beyond these, can be seen in
the fact that Australian tinned cooked meat, which is far more eco-
nomical than the lowest-priced butcher's meat, besides being more
nutritious, is not yet sold in the poorer neighbourhoods to the
extent it is among the middle and higher classes.”
No doubt. The very paupers in the workhouses turn the
nose of scorn up at Australian Meat, which they, whilst
they were earning a truly good living, never tried. But
what are called poor º contain many, com-
aratively rich people, highly-paid artificers, inhabiting
ow-rented houses, being cheaply clad, and subject to
next to no taxation but that of their gin. These pros-
perous people can, in fact, afford to eat butcher's meat
much better than the great majority of the higher and
middle classes, who pay all manner of taxes, have ostenta-
tion to support in respect of abode, attire, and other exter-
mals, and are fain to eat the cheapest meat they can at
their own tables, seeing that none but the best the butcher
sends is put up with in the kitchen. The contempt of the
Striking Classes for Australian meat is one more gratifying proof of their progressional elevation, whereof the ascending scale is visibl
measured by the rise of beef and of oysters. Don't mention
Qyster-sauce, Not a word to them, especially just now, about any
fare-roast beef and turkey, preliminary to plum-pudding and mince-pie,

Washing down all those good things with abundance of
“fizz,” the sons of toil, and especially the jolly colliers, will generally, let us hope, thoroughly enjoy their Christmas.
A CHRISTMAS-BOX FOR BISMARCK.
A MERRY Christmas to members of all denominations! Our
Roman Catholic fellow-citizens, on Sunday last week, were treated
to a spiritual draught of water from the fountain-head, or, let us
say, beer from the brewery. In all their Churches and Chapels, at
#. Mass, by order of their Archbishop, they had read to them
either, part or the whole of the plucky Sid Popº's thoroughgoing
Encyclical Letter, just out, “upon the present persecution of the
Catholic Church.” There are thoughtless Protestants who, perhaps,
under-estimate the severity of this persecution. They compare the
treatment of the German ti. Bishops of the present §
with that which the early Christians experienced under NERO, an
some of that Emperor's successors. And they pretend to say that
ARCHBISHOP LEDOCHovski and his fellow-sufferers undergo no
martyrdom because they are not any of them thrown to lions, or
wrapped up in pitched canvass and set on fire, but merely get fined.
Those cavillers forget, or ignore, or deny, or do not know that
LoRD BYRON says:—
“Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,
But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.”
Religion does not make an Ultramontane less sensitiye of a fine
than an Evangelical is, unless H.P. in case the former have taken
a vow of poverty. . Moreover, being fined, though it is, in a sense,
bleeding for the faith, does not, or used not to, for aught that has
appeared, constitute the victim a canonical martyr, nor make him a
çºnfessor even. The persecution of the Ultramontane Prelates and
.# is very real, and quite as severe as would be enough to make
most Protestants subject to it roar. That is, the faithful are really
fººverely persecuted if they are really and truly fined for their
altºn. -
Because, on the other hand, BISMARCK says that Ultramon-
tanism, is punished not as religion, but as rebellion; , and then
comes the question where religion ends and rebellion begins. . Some
light may be thrown, upon this point.by the , statement in the
imes, that, on the reading of the Encyclical, as above-mentioned:—
“By desire of ARCHBishop MANNING the faithful were at the same time
formally warned, in their several congregations, that those who dispute or
deny the definition of the Infallibility of 5. Roman Pontiff, or impugn the
decrees and dogmatical constitutions of the late Watican Council, incur the
penalties attaching to the sin of § and are in danger of being excom-
municated from the Unity of the Church, and from the Fold of Christ.”
For Ultramontanes it thus seems clear that religion must include
everything which the Pope, ear cathedrá, may declare to be religion.
By the way, now that those within the Roman Catholic Church who
do not believe this are to be shut out ºf it, not many more outsiders,
º: will enter it but those who have a fancy for a leap in the
| dark, which may some day commit them to collision with their
country's laws. . Howeyer, Infallibility only can w the line
between things civil and religious for its own. But, in the mean-
time, could it not cut the German knot which, for heretics at least,
it cannot untie P Here the faithful, by order of DR. MANNING,
have had the Pope's Encyclical_read to them in every Roman
Catholic Church and Chapel in London. What liberty for them
to enjoy! ... Was the diatribe of His Holiness likewise read at
Berlin P. If not, why not? *. because there is no such
Archbishop in Prussia as the titular ARCHBIshop of WESTMINSTER,
Now, could not his Holiness contrive to create such another there P
Could he not reconstitute the whole German hierarchy, and turn
the Church now bound to the State into a voluntary association?
Suppose, in short, he caused it to disestablish and disendow itself.
Then his Bishops in Germany would be as free as they are in
England; and perhaps PRINCE BISMARCK would interfere, with
ARCHBIshop LEDochovski as little as MR. GLADstone thinks of
doing with ARCHBIshop MANNING. What a seasonable stroke of
olicy on the Pope's part a decree of dissolution of partnership
etween Church and State would be! Prussia would, as for reli-
gious concord, no longer be in case to envy Ireland; the most per-
secuted of German º would lead as jolly a life as that of
CARDINAL CULLEN. The repeal of that union which is the excuse
of the Prussian Government for meddling with ecclesiastical affairs,
would, if º pronounced in a papal edict, be a message
of peace and good-will, peculiarly suitable to this festive season.
A Railway Safety Act.
... A Goods Train is in the act of starting; a Mail Train dashes into
it; the passengers escape with shakes and contusions, nothing but
property is destroyed." Then what ought to be done? Of course
the Board of Trade admonishes the Railway Directors of the line on
which the accident occurred, in consequence of parsimonious
arrangements, to be more careful for the future—or. at? The
Board of Trade will do something. One thing it might do is to
apply to Parliament for an Act, imposing a heavy penalty in any
case of collision, whether attended with actual loºs' of life or not.
If collisions were made more expensive to Railway Companies than
precautions to prevent them, the precautions would be taken
immediately.

And blend your mistletoe with yew.

TIT FOR TAT.
A “NATIONAL Federation of Employers” has been
formed for defensive purposes against the designs of

CHRISTMAS ABROAD.
IN Poland they fasten up all the back doors, in the presence of
unimpeachable witnesses, with gilt-headed nails, and burn branches
of laurestinus and lavender, liberally steeped in brandy, before the
houses of the wealthier inhabitants, to the music of castanets and
hautboys.
In Greece the boys (if under twelve) and girls are allowed to
remain in bed an hour later than usual; and the most muscular men
in each parish take it in turns to sit astride the church weather-
cock and proclaim the hour from four A.M. to four P.M., when they
adjourn to the house of the Chief Architrave, and are regaled wit
sweetmeats and syllabubs at the expense of the rate-payers.
In Asia Minor the streets are strewn with crocuses and snowdrops
at daybreak, and soft music is played at intervals, by wind instru-
ments, in the piazzas and arcades without intermission.
In Illyria the principal dish is an Ibex roasted whole, stuffed
with pistachio nuts, truffles, olives, ortolans, oysters, forcemeat
balls, plovers' eggs, and Sultana raisins, and º up with a sauce
consisting of cream, currant jelly, port wine, prunes, sweet almonds,
and the best Maraschino.
In Sweden, all the dogs, cats, and domesticated poultry, have
blue ribbons tied round their necks by the local Magistracy, to
which little silver bells are subsequently attached by the unmarried
ladies. A procession is then formed, headed by the hand-bells and
companies of minstrels, answering in some respects to our Waits,
but dressed in scarlet and orange, which makes the circuit of the
town walls till the clocks strike twelve, when the torches are all
extinguished, and the crowd go home to sup off curlews and
cranberry tart.
In Savoy, the curious old custom of charming the spider—handed
down from pre-historic times—is still kept up with much pomp and
ceremony. Deputations from all the principal Guilds and Corpora-
tions attend, with flags and banners emblazoned with green spiders
on a gold ground, and for many days beforehand the passes and
gorges re-echo to this quaint ditty (sung to a street-organ accom-
paniment)-
“The Spider we charm,
To keep us from harm,
From warlock, and weevil, and drought;
From the sting of the bee,
And the foam of the Sea,
From toothache, lumbago, and gout.”
And then they join hands and dance round the blazing yule log.
A Rare Waterfowl.
At a public meeting on Monday last week at Plymouth, con-
vened by the Mayor, the medal of the Royal Humane Society was
*::::::: on behalf of that Association by the Bishop of ExFTER
to a young lady, Miss REYNoLDs, for having, in August last,
saved a girl from drowning by swimming out to her assistance.
This act of courage recalls to mind the similar exploits achieved by
the brave GRAce DARLING, whose name has a sense in which it may
be considered applicable to Miss REYNoLDs, with this additiºn, that
a young lady º; has saved life by ºnal swimming deserves
moreover to be accounted a regular duck.

QUEER QUERIES.
CAN a Bill of Exchange drawn
payable at sight be legally pre-
sented at an Irish Blind Asylum ?
Is it known in good society
how many British Cattle-owners
reside in Cattleownia?
Do men of Iron Constitution
ever get a little rusty in damp
weather?
If a Mad Dog won the Derby,
would it be correct to term the
feat a “rabid act of horseman-
ship?”
May young ladies be asked if
they can wear a ship, when the
sails are “blown to ribbons?"
Advice GRAtis.-You wish to
give CLEMENTINA a New Year's
resent. You have thought of a
oy Terrier. You want to know
where you can procure it. Go
into a toy-shop, and ask for one.
You will be sure to get it.
BotANY AND Acoustics.-Cot-
ton, being a light substance, is
not therefore called Gossypium,
because gossypium is not Latin
for “gossip." Note, also, that
gossip is, on the contrary, ex-
cluded by cotton in the ears.
ErhNoLogy. – The Pigmies
were not altogether a fabulous
race; the Boshmen may be so
called because they are no bosh.
Thus it is by no means true
that your only pigmies are little
pigs.

A FEW QUERIES.
Do you envy the Critic who has to read
all the new novels of the week?
Do you envy the Official whe has to go
through all the comedies, tragedies
farces, melodramas, pantomimes, an
burlesques, which are brought out on the
Stage in the course of the year?
Do you envy the Householder who has
Fº to the right of him, dogs to the
eft of him, a street much favoured by
costermongers to the rear of him, and a
#. with a musical family opposite to
ill-
Do you envy your neighbour DINNING,
with his four boys all at home for the
Christmas holidays, and two young
friends with them?
Do you envy Princes, Policemen, Prime
Ministers, Postmen, Editors, Head Mas-
ters, and Omnibus Conductors?
THE OLD AND NEW YEAR.
As the days are getting in,
There are people who grow thin;
Whilst the days are getting out,
Other people then grow stout.
A REAL HERo.—Think for a moment of
that man's perils and adventures: The
African traveller cannot approach them";
the Arctic Explorer cannot hope to equal
them. He had sat upon thorns, stood
on the verge of a precipice, fallen be-
tween two stools, been riveted to the
spot, gone through fire and water, flung
himself into the breach, raised a storm in
a teacup, bearded a lion in his den, taken
a bull by the horns, gone oil wildgoose
chases, played with edged-tools, cut off
his nose to te his face, burnt his
fingers, stood between two fires, paved
the way, broken the ice, strained eve
nerve to raise the sinews of war, and le
no stone unturned to gain the summit of
his ambition. The last time we heard of
him, after running the gauntlet and
escaping from the horns of a dilemma, he

CHRISTMAS CARDs.
FRoxt the KIMMERIDGEs, with an in-
vitation to dinner, which the experience
of many winters tells you will be formal,
heavy, and tedious, mild in its menu,
and mysterious in its wines.
From the DE BoyARDs, to an “At
Home,” where you will meet with no
one you know, and from which you will
make your escape with relief.
From the long-established and onl
genuine and authentic Waits of the paris
of St. Maximus, soliciting you for some
small pecuniary compliment in return
for their musical services during the past
month.
From your Cousin in Norfolk (a post-
card), announcing that in consequence of
a mysterious disease which has made
great ravages amongst his Turkeys, he
will not be able to send you one this
Christmas.
From Aunt UGGATHoRNE–the relict of
your Uncle JAMEs—(likewise a post-card)
to say that she intends coming over from
Dalston to spend the day and stay all
night on Thursday, when you expect the

dinner.

known example of the Arabesque period
of architecture.
TEMPERANCE NURSERY REIYME.
CHARLEY loves good milk and tea;
Charley loves good coffee;
Charley loves a pretty girl
As sweet as Everton Toffee.
Domestic Disconn.—The clocks dif-
fered and were at sixes and sevens, the
fire-irons fell out—the tongs being par-
ticularly noisy—the bellows, came, to
blows, one table groaned and another
was in a roar, the doors were quite
unhinged, the kettle boiled, over, and
the jams and preservesjarred with each
other.

ANECDOTES OF THE GREAT.
ZIMMERMANN disliked being left alone.
He was the life and soul of every party
he entered, and sang a capital comic
song.
&ensions. favourite dish for supper
was toasted cheese. He invariably wore
a sunflower in his button-hole.
Burke composed The Sublime and
Beautiful partly in the Jamaica Coffee-
house, an rtly when he was lodging
over a hair-dresser's in Wigmore Street.
The pen with which he wrote the last
sentence was long preserved by the hair-
dresser's descendants; but, after the fall
of the wig, and before the rise of the
chignon, they became embarrassed in
their circumstances, and parted with
this heirloom to the agent of an American
Museum.
FREDERick THE GREAT played the flute
.. micely, and had an agreeable tenor
voice.
BEETHove N composed his celebrated
Metaphysical Symphony in a flowered
dressing-gown and embroidered smoking-
cap, with a bouquet of fresh Dahlias on
the ichord, a hedgehog in a basket
by the fire, and a man-servant in livery
in the antechamber. -
GIBBox was remarkably superstitious,
and always carried a charm about with
him in his hat-box. What its nature was

threw it into the Tiber on the eve of his

sion of BENJAMIN WEst. It is now the
property of a well-known collector in the
east of England. Amongst the most
precious rarities are a holograph letter
from MRs. GRUNDy—she usually em-
ployed an amanuensis—all about her
neighbours' affairs; the signature of Mr.
John (familiarly known as “Jack")
RQBINsoN, appended to an order for a

RIDAY's mark on the sand; the MS. of
MRs. GLAsse's celebrated receipt—“First

by William Pitt, when a boy at school,

trumpet has not been heard of for many
years; but, not long ago, a ket of
snuff was found in a cupboard in what
used to be his ting-room, in the
house he occupied in Red Lion Square,
then the most fashionable quarter of
Town. Unfortunately, the Royal Academy
let the opportunity slip of acquiring the
snuff, which got dispersed, and is now
irrecoverably lost.
It is always interesting to trace a
familiar phrase to its source. Thus in
SiR THoxias Brown's studious habits we
clearly see the origin of a “brown study.”
THOUGHT FOR THE TOiLET.
PAINT, fair Creature, on the face,
Speaks the injudicious flirt,
Being matter in wrong place-
PALMERston's account of dirt.
In false colours a mistake
They commit the face who rig;
For its pigment doth partake
Of the nature of a pig.
Daub of crimson is a grace,
On fair cheek, to mental eye,
Such as to a nigger's face
DAY AND MARTIN would supply.
The WEGETABLE World.—There was a
#eat stir in our garden the other day.
The Potatoes were ready to jump out of
their skins. The Beet turned red to its
very roots. The Celery lost their heads,
and the Cabbages their hearts. The Peas
split their pods with excitement. The
Asparagus could with difficulty be kept
in its bed. The Parsley curled itself up
in a corner. The Cucumber alone main-
tained his habitual coolness. The cause
of all this commotion was the presence of
a noted Vegetarian. The Potatoes never
took their eyes off him.
A GREAT CURIosity.-We are ac-
quainted with a Ritualistic young Lady,
- who is fond of collecting seals, stamps,
monograms, devices, &c. She is very
roud of her latest acquisition—a fine
pression from the Seal of Confession.
GEographical.—The Society Islands
are in the Pacific Ocean; the Good
Society Islands are much nearer home.
AN IMPossible REQUEST.--To ask any
one to “stop a minute.”
T You, DEAR”.

He drank toast-and water gaily;

With sherbèt in the summer daily.

GUIDANCE IN GALLANTRY. —Never at-
tend any lady, to whom you think of
making yourself agreeable, to any plaſ’,
opera, or other performance, that you
want to hear. You cannot attend to both
it and her. The same remark applies to
your plate before you on the dinner-
table and the attraction at your side.
Moreover, whenever you take the object
of your affections anywhere, in the hope
of seeing or listening to anything with
enjoyment enhanced by her society, be
always prepared for the probability of
her being taken with an interesting in-
dispositiºn.
CLERGY AND CANNIBALs.—We shudder
at the feasts of savages who devour mis-
sionaries, but do not consider perhaps so
seriously as we might with what disgust
we ourselvos may be regarded by some
of our neighbours, who, acquainted by
report only with our insular manners
and customs, are informed that the na-
tives of this island eat Bishops' Thumbs,
Parsons' Noses, and Pºpes' Eyes.
WRoNG Colours.-Black books, black
looks, blacklegs, blue devils, blue ruin,
red noses, red tape, grey mares, white lies,
white feathers, white squalls, greenbacks,

broidery, bouquets, and Ritualists' stoles,
copes, and petticoats.

Do you wish me, my dears?
New Years happy not only, but many,

Don't care when you come in
For the old Fogy's tin *
Eh? I'm sure that is very unselfish of
you.
The Voice of THE STARs.—Those born
on the first, three days of February, as
well as on all other days in any month of
the year, will be liable to colds, if they
sit a long time in draughts of air or in
damp clothes. Let them shun dealings
with patent-medicine vendors, mesme.
rists, mediums, fºrtune-tellers, astro-
logers, and old humbugs.
To Poach Egos–Put on a suit of black,
a broad-brimmed hat, and a pair of
spectacles; sling a wallet at your back,
take a walking-came in your hand, go
into the woods, botanise, put into your
wallet all the plants you pick, and all
the pheasants' and partridges' eggs you
find in your way into your pockets.
A SEASONABLE QUotATroN.—All the
Editors of GRAY have most unaccountably
failed to perceive that in the line where
he speaks of “the weights, that play be:
low," the true reading must be “Waits.”
PLUCKY ANswer. — Framiner – What
was AkCHIMELFs's Screw 7 candidate—
An unsound, broken-down horse, wanting
whip and spur to make him go, that
Archimedes was flat enough to buy.
METRICAL IDEALISM.–On the birthday
of ALExANDRA, Princess of Wales, the
Poet Laureate will perhaps compose an
Ode in Alexandrine verses.

tian,” said a Poacher in gaol to bimself
“sarved the same as a hare 7–When he'ſ

She is Monarch of all she surveys, Behold her surrounded by those Loºk prºud, pretty Queen, from thy shrine,
Her right there is none to dispute, Whose homage is lavishly done, And thy vassals so loftily scan–
On her altar submissively lays The world at the tip of her toes, But tell them their labour, and thine,
Its choicest, each fowl and each brute. •- And its denizens crouching—save one. Is to make thee seem fair to—a Man.
