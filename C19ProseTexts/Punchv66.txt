In Jyll.
So many times they jousted in the lists,
Municipal and Parliamentary,
All lists that open for all tournament,
Sir Wilfrid the Permissive, known besides
As the Probibitory, or-two names
Of counter-meaning in cross meaning joined —
As the Permissive and Prohibitory,
And he, the Wittler-warrior, stout Sir Bung.
For once SiR WILFRID, in Caerleon,
Holding high feast with his Teetotallers,
Had sworn to lay Sir Bung low in the lists,
And after take him captive, and in bonds
Bind hand and foot, for his Teetotallers
To make their mock, and wreak their will of him.
And now, through all the land was blown the shock
Of hobby against hobby, steel on steel,
And trumpet answering trumpet, throats of brass,
Either defying other, and both Truth
And Sense and Logic, for what strengths are these
In the encounter of such opposites
To stand, and not be trampled in the dust ?
High-seated, with one hunch prone-beaked before,
Clad in red samite, mystic, wonderful,
And one bebind, tip-tilted, Punce, the King
Of that great joust, and all the jousts that are
Or have been, or shall be, on English ground.
The King that knows, as none but he hath known,
With knowledge baffling knowledge to say when,
Or where, or whence, or how he came by it,
Betwixt opposing edges, points opposed,
To fling his warder, that, so flung, com pels,
In spite of mêlée-madness, clash of brass,
And ranks that ride à outrance against ranks,
Wrath to good-will, and good to better will,
And better will to best—a blameless King,
Knowing his knights, the length of each man's foot,
And each man's head, and how to handicap,
Another Rouse and yet a better Rouse,
Their hobbies for encounter, in the lists
At Westminster, when on the tower the light
Flares, and the SPEAKER, spent, nods in his chair,
"Twixt stuffiness above and stuff below,
Bude-lights and boredom, and all men, save Punch,
Wax wild for wantonness and weariness.
SIR WILFRID's helm was fasbioned like the pot

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 27, 1874.
For thee and thy Teetotallers to be
A plaything and a pastime, and to sit
Fettered with law-fast hours and fenced with rules—
"
Wherein the tea, or what men drink for such
By Chinaman's permission, is infused :
And all the surcoat covering his steel,
And all his horse's housings that o'er-swept
His limbs from frog to forehead, were set thick
With pumps emblazoned azure, and to each
Its spout and scroll and legend“ Cold without."
Sir Bung displayed three spiggots on his shield,
Issuant proper with both pale and brown,
Surcoat and housings broidered both “Hot with.”
Nimble SiR WILFRID was, cunning of fence,
And quick to cut and parry, thrust and guard,
But, for he rode his destrere without rein
Or curb, Sır Bung had him at avantage,
And knew it, and was more than a match for him,
For all his beefier bulk and wheezier breath.
Three times they clashed, and once Sir Wilfrid bore
Sir Bung to earth, but up he rose again,
And buffetted SIR WILFRID, caught again
His steed, and sprang to selle, with timely aid
Of Cross his Squire, and while the tilt-yard rang
With shouts of “Hot with !" and " A Bung!” charged
home
And smote Sir WILFRID fair upon the shield
And wrenched him backward, till with a great heave
He scarce recovering, straightway to his sword
Betook him, and Sir Bung too drew his blade,
For the arbitrement of mortal strife.
For “Sooner death,” he said, "than in thy Hall
Of Exeter or of Caerleon,
But Punch, who saw their bitterness, arose,
And flung his warder 'twixt the combatants,
And with a Ho! staid strife, and spake to them,
“Both worthy, both unwise, both wrong, both right:
Drunkenness is an evil, Liberty
A good ; but shall that evil on that good
Be turned to quell that good, when 'tis the good
Should quell the evil? Foe to Liberty
Is Licence—not for that be Licence used
As cause of war with Liberty; Liberty
Should rather control Licence, till, controlled,
She ceases to be Licence, and becomes
A friend to Liberty, and not a foe.
But now break off your strife. Lo, I have here
Royal reward for prowess—not for you
Alone, for all good lances, knightly blades
On earth, I bring it- "
So he disappeared
In his pavilion.
Then with a great blast
Of brass, and clash of bells from steeples round,
And roar of Woolwich Infants, dark, deep-voiced,
Broad-breeched, black-muzzled, the pavilion swung
Its curtains back, and therein stood revealed,
With Punch that over-leapt it, lance in rest-
VOL. SIXTY-SIX to an admiring world !

THE COMING RACE.
While Jesdames Wilkins and Perkins are discussing grave School-Board matters and Parliamentary business, their respective Husbands are engaged on a topic more genial to their softer
natures and weaker intellects.
“ISN'T SHE A DARLING PET, FRED! AND JUST FANCY-TWO PRONT TEETH, AND ONLY FOUR MONTHS LAST TUESDAY WEEK"
“WELL, I NEVERI! WHY, MY DARLING ICKLE TOTTY HASN'T CUT A SINGLE TOOTH, AND HE'S Six MONTHS TO-MORROW! HOW DO YOU FEED HER, Toy?”
NOT IN THE DICTIONARIES.-Language is always suscep-
tible of improvement. Thus a coterie of Ladies might
with perfect propriety be tormed a potticoterie.
WHEN is a Lunatic like a pretty flower ?
When he is a little dazey.
SHABBY EVASION.
Thou hast no birthday, Dear, to call
For any gift this year thereon,
As thy nativity doth fall
On Sunday.-which is dies non.
RUS IN URBE.-In October, November, and even Decem-
ber anu January, violets which peep out of little beds of
moss, with wicker frames, may be seen blooming all about
the banks of Lombard Street.
What PRINCES SMOKE.-- Regalias.

NEW EDITION OF WALKER.
The Baker rolls.
The Butcher shamblos.
The Banker balances himself
well.
Tho Cook has a minciog gait.
The Livery-stable Keoper has
a "musing gait."
The Excursionist trips along.
The Fishmonger flounders on.
The Poulterer waddles like a
duck,
The Gardoner does not allow
the grass to grow under his feet.
The Grocer treads gingerly.
The Indiarubber Manufacturer
has an elastic step.
The Rogue shuffles, and
The Doctor's pace is killing.
FAMOUS SAYINGS.
"BRIDE-CAKE or Westminster
Abbey !"
“See, my Son, how easily the
world is bumbugged."
“Above all, no veal."
“ After me, the Income-tax."
"Save me from my duns."
“Rome was not built in
twenty-four hours."
“ Property has its taxes as
well as its rates."
rich,
in his dotieful in his
THE GOLDEX HAIR REVIVER.
It is a well-known fact that sud-
den grief will have the effect of
whitening the hair. There was
once a poor author whose hair
anxiety had turned prematurely
groy. Now for a fact not gene-
rally known, News came that
an Aunt, whom he had never
Boen, bad died and left him a
fortune. His hair immediately
turned brown again. N.B. The
Platin Truth.
WEDDING PRESENTS. - Some
girls like silk dresses, others
prefer jewellery. That sepsible
little creature MINNIE WISSITT,
Who is marrying on four hundred
and fifty, told Uncle ANDREW
tbat & few tons of Silkstones
would be the most acceptable
thing he could give her.
THE PATRON SAINT OF CABINET-
MAKERS.-St. Andrew by the
“WHO GOES THERE ?"
Wardrobe.
Young Sentry (on the Gold Coast). "HULLO! SHALL I SHOOT FIRST, AND CHALLENGE AFTERWARDS? STOP
THE Cat's PARADISE.-Lapland. ! A BIT, THOUGH; PRHAPS IT'S ONE OF OUR FANTEE ALLIES!"
THE BITTER DROP.-One who
had the reputation of being a
great philosopher, an experi-
enced man of the world, a pro-
found thinker, and an acute
observer with a deep insight into
human nature, has left on record
the expression of his firm con-
viction, that no man, however
rich, however gifted, however
fortunate in his domestic rela-
tions, however successful in his
public undertakings, can be pro-
nounced bappy-whose trouscrs
bag at the knees.
PROFESSIONAL ENTHUSIASM. -
A gentleman of the long robe
was so proud of it that, having
been, just after he bad been
called to the bar, invited to a pic-
nic, he went there in his wig and
gown. But why not? The ladies
present wore not only their
gowns but also their chignons.
CHRISTMAS GENIALITIES.-Re-
spectable Solicitor, deck your
office with the evergreens of the
season. Registrar, be especially
careful to hang up a great bunch
of mistletoe.
GARDENING AMUSEMENT FOR
COLWELL-HATCUNEY. - Spinning
Turnip Tops.

" You cannot taste in the
dark," said a Lecturer. “Na-
ture has intended us to seo our
food."
“Then," inquired a forward
pupil, “how about a blind man
at dinner?"
“Nature, Sir," answered the
Professor, "has provided him
with Eye teeth." *
QUEER QUERIES.
CAN a Bill of Exchange drawn
payable at sight be legally pro-
sented at an Irish Blind Asylum?
Is it known in good society
how many British Cattle-owners
reside in Cattleownia ?
Do men of Iron Constitution
ever get a little rusty in damp
weather?
If a Mad Dog won the Derby,
would it be corroct to term tho
feat a "rabid act of borsuman-
ship?"
May young ladies be asked if
they can wear a ship, when tho
sails are “blown to ribbons ?"

PAIRS.-How admirably well
certain persons and things go
together! How invariably we
associate in our minds bricks
and mortar, and BEAUMONT and
FLETCHER, and CHAPLIN and
HORNE, and ANTONY and CLEO-
PATRA, and supply and demand,
and Sherry and bitters, and taro
and tret, and abstract and con-
crete, and oysters and Chablis !
THE SXAKES AND THE SHAM-
ROCK. - According to Tradition.
the aboriginal races of Ireland
included the O'Phidians, St. Pat-
rick drove the whole tribe of
them into the bogs.
ADVICE TO YOUNG HOUSE-
KEEPERS. - Put your washing
out, if you do not wish your
husband to be put out.
PROPOBED EXCAVATION IN THE
CITY OF LONDON.-Dig for the
Municipal Budy in Alderman-
bury.
THERE's one Tree that ought
to be well off for burk--the Dog-
rose Tree.
NOTE FOR MARTINMAS. - In a
Man's Life there is no St. Mar.
tin's Summer.
MY LADY'S EPIGRAM.-Male is
only Mule spelt wrongly.
ADVICE GRATIS.--You wish to
give CLEMENTINA & New Year's
present. You have thought of a
Toy Terrier. You want to know
where you can procure it. Go
into a toy-shop, and ask for ono.
You will be sure to get it.
BOTANY AND ACOUSTICS.-Cot-
ton, being a light substance, is
not thereforo called Gossypium,
because gossypium is not Latin
for "gossip." Note, also, that
gossip is, on the contrary, ex-
cluded by cotton in the oars.
ETHNOLOGY. - The Pigmies
were not altogether a fabulous
raco; the Boshmen may bo so
called because they are no bosh.
Thus it is by no means true
that your only pigmies are little
pigs.
Axiom FOR THE KITCHEN.
Tbings rubbed against a grater
become less.
SHOCKING!

THE TITMOUSE AND TRUNCHEON.- The Small Birds Pro-
tection Act has constituted our Police the special guardians

spondent.)
ANIMAL SPIRITS.
SAID a Calf unto an Ass,
“Did you ever eat the hay
Which was made of sparrow-grass !"
Edward burst into a bray.
BLACK AND WHITE.-Much harmless satire has been ex.

Severe Scotch Schoolmistress (visiting some English Friends). “SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS, 18 IT! Ah! VARA PRETTY! AND CHERUBS DO VARA WEEL IN A PICTURE; BUT I DINNA CARE
FOR BAIRNIES WHOSE PEELINGS I CAN'T APPEAL TO!"

A FEW QUERIES.
Do you envy the Critic who has to read
all the new novels of the week?
Do you envy the Official who has to go
through all the comedios, tragedies,
farces, melodramas, pantomimes, and
burlesques, which are brought out on the
Stage in the course of the year?
Do you envy the Housebolder who has
poultry to the right of him, dogs to the
left of him, a street much favoured by
costermongers to the rear of bim, and a
piano with a musical family opposite to
him?
Do you envy your neighbour Dinnina,
with his four boys all at home for the
Christmas holidays, and two young
friends with them?
Do you envy Princes. Policemen, Prime
Ministers, Postmn, Editors, Head Mas.
ters, and Omnibus Conductors ?
CHRISTMAS CARDS.
FROM the KIMMERIDGES, with an in-
vitation to dinner, which the experience
of many winters tells you will be formal,
heavy, and tedious, mild in its menu,
and mysterious in its wines.
From the DE BOYARDS, to an “At
Home," where you will meet with no
one you know, and from which you will
make your escape with relief.
From the long-established and only
genuine and authentic Waits of the parish
of St. Maximus, soliciting you for some
small pecuniary compliment in return
for their musical services during the past
month.
From your Cousin in Norfolk (a post-
card), announcing that in consequence of
a mysterious disease which has made
great ravages amongst his Turkeys, he
will not be able to send you one this
Christmas.
From Aunt UGGATHORNE-the relict of
your Uncle JAMES-(likewise a post-card)
to say that she intends coming over from
Dalston to spend the day and stay all
night on Thursday, when you expect the
GRANBY PALMERS and ten other people to
dinner.
From the Incumbent of the Parish of
Grabthorpe, in Northumberland, asking
your kind assistance towards the restora-
tion of an ancient Campanile, the only
known example of the Arabesque period
of architecture.
THE OLD AND NEW YEAR.
As the days are getting in,
There are people who grow thin;
Whilst the days are getting out,
Other people then grow stout,
TEMPERANCE NURSERY RHYME.
CHARLEY loves good milk and tea:
CHARLEY loves good coffee ;
CHARLEY loves a pretty girl
As sweet as Everton Toffee.
A REAL HERO.-Think for a moment of
that man's per ils and adventures! The
African traveller cannot approach them:
the Arctic Explorer cannot hope to equal
them. He had sat upon thorns, stood
on the verge of a precipice, fallen be-
tween two stool, been riveted to the
spot, gone through fire an i water, flung
himself into the breach, raised a storm in
a teacup, bearded a lion in his den, taken
a bull by the horns, gone ou wildgoose
chases, played with edged-tools, cut off
his nose to spite his face, burnt his
fingers, stood between two fires, paved
the way, broken the ice, strained every
nerve to raise the sinews of war, and left
no stone unturned to gain the summit of
bis ambition. The last time we heard of
him, after running the gauntlet and
escaping from the horns of a dilemma, bo
had been on tenter-hooks, and was then
preparing to jump out of the frying-pan
into the fire.
A YOUTHFUL ATTACHMENT.-Our green-
grocer and head-waiter, who is an old
bachelor, confesses that he was once in

DOMESTIC DISCORD.-The clocks dif-
fered and were at sixes and sevens, the
fire-irons fell out-the tongs being par-
ticularly noisy-the bellows came to
blows, one table groaned and another
was in a roar, the doors were quito
unhinged, the kettle boiled over, and
the jams and preserves jarred with each
other.

years; but, not long ago, a packet of
snuff was found in a eupboard in what
used to be his painting-room, in tho

then the most fashionable quarter of
Town. Unfortunately, the Royal Academy
let the opportunity slip of acquiring the

irrecoverably lost.
It is always interesting to trace a
familiar phrase to its source. Thus in
SIR THOMAS BROWN's studious habits wo

ANECDOTES OF THE GREAT.
ZIMMERMANN disliked being left alone.
He was the life and soul of every party
he entered, and sang a capital comic
song.
COPERNICUS's favourite dish for supper
was toasted checse. He invariably wore
a sunflower in his button-hole.
BURKE composed The Sublime and
Beautiful partly in the Jamaica Coffee-
house, and partly when he was lodging
over a hair-dresser's in Wigmore Street.
The pen with which he wrote the last
sentence was long preserved by the hair-
dresser's doscendants ; but, after tho fall
of tho wig, and before the rise of the
chignon, they became embarrassed in
tbeir circumstances, and parted with
this heirloom to the agent of an American
Museum.
FREDERICK THE GREAT played the flute
very nicely, and had an agreeable tenor
voice.
BEETHOVEN composed his colebrated
Metaphysical Symphony in a flowered
dressing-gown and embroidered smoking-
cap, with a bouquet of fresh Dahlias on
the harpsichord, a hedgehog in a basket
by the fire, and a man-servant in livery
in the antecbamber.
GIBBON was remarkably superstitious,
and always carried a charm about with
him in his hat-box. What its nature was
it would be useloss to conjecture, as he
throw it into the Tiber on the eve of his
second marriage.
The finest collection of Autographs ever
formed was that belonging to DR. SOUTH.
At his sale it was bought by LORD NORTH,
and, subsequently, it came intothe posses-
sion of BENJAMIN WEST, It is now the
property of a well-known collector in the
east of England. Amongst the most
precious rarities are a holograph letter
from MRS. GRUNDY-she usually em.
ployed an amanuensis-all about her
neighbours' affairs; the signature of MR.
JOHN (familiarly known as "Jack")
ROBINSON, appended to an order for a
gallon of palm oil; a cast in plaster of
FRIDAY's mark on the sand; the MS. of
MRS. GLASSE's celebrated receipt-"First
catch your hard;” and a letter written
by WILLIAM PITT, when a boy at school,
to his father (the Great EARL OF CHAT-
HAM), begging that he would send him
a plum-cake and some sausage-rolls.

For its pigment doth partako
Of the nature of a pig.
Daub of crimson is a grace,
On fair cheek, to mental eyo,
Such as to a nigger's face
DAY AND MARTIN would supply.
THE VEGETABLE WORLD.-There was a
great stir in our garden the other day.
The Potatoes were ready to jump out of
their skins. The Beet turned red to its
very roots. The Celery lost their heads.
and the Cabbages their hearts. The Peas
split their pods with excitement. The
Asparagus could with difficulty be kept
in its bod. The Parsley curled itself up
in a corner. The Cucumber alone main-
tained his habitual coolness. The cause
of all this commotion was the presence of
a noted Vegetarian, The Potatoes never
took their eyes off him.
A GREAT CURIOSITY. - We are ac-
quainted with a Ritualistic young Lady,
who is fond of collecting seals, stamps,
monograms, devices, &c. She is very
proud of her latest acquisition-& fino
impression from the Seal of Confession.
GEOGRAPHICAL.- The Society Islands
are in the Pacific Ocean; the Good
Society Islands are much nearer home.
AN IMPOSSIBLE REQUEST.-To ask any
one to “stop a minute."

GUIDANCE IN GALLANTRY.-Never at-
tend any lady, to whom you think of
making yourself agreeable, to any play,
opera, or other performance, that you
want to hear. You cannot attend to both
it and her. The same remark applies to
your plate before you on the dinner-
table and the attraction at your side.
Moreover, whenever you take the object
of your affections anywhere, in the hope
of seeing or listening to anything with
enjoyment enhanced by her society, be
always prepared for the probability of
her being taken with an interesting in-
disposition.
CLERGY AND CANNIBALS.-We shudder
at the feasts of savages who devour mis-
sionaries, but do not consider perhaps so
seriously as we might with what disgust
we ourselves may be regarded by some
of our neighbours, who, acquainted by
report only with our insular manners
and customs, are informed that the na-
tives of this island eat Bishops' Thumbs,
Parsons' Noses, and Popes' Eyes.
WRONG COLOURS.-Black books, black
looks, blacklegs, blue devils, blue ruin,
red noses, red tape, grey mares, wbite lies,
white feathers, white squalls, greenbacks,
greenhorns, and the green-eyed monster.
WOMAN'S WORK IN THE CHURCH.-Em-
broidery, bouquets, and Ritualists' stoles,
copes, and petticoats.
THE VOICE OF THE STARS.Those born
on the first three days of February, as
well as on all other days in any month of
the year, will be liable to colds, if they
sit a long time in draughts of air or in
damp clothes, Let them shun dealings
with patent-medicine vendors, mesme-
rists, mediums, fortune-tellers, astro.
logers, and old humbugs.
To Poach Eggs.-Put on a suit of black,
a broad brimmed hat, and a pair of
spectacles ; sling a wallet at your back,
take a walking-cane in your hand, go
into the woods, botanise, put into your
wallet all the plants you pick, and all
the pheasants' and partridges' eggs you
find in your way into your pockets.
A SEASONABLE QUOTATION. - All the
Editors of GRAY have most unaccountably
failed to perceive that in the line where
he speaks of "the weights, that play be-
low," the true reading must be "Waits."
PLUCKY ANSWER. — Examiner - What
was ARCHIMEDES'S Screw? Candidate-
Anunsound, broken-down horse, wanting
whip and spur to make him go, that
ARCHIMEDES was flat enough to buy.
METRICAL IDEALISM.-On the birthday
of ALEXANDRA, Princess of Wales, the
Poet Laureate will perhaps compose an
Ode in Alexandrine verses,
PRISON THOUGHT.--"When's a Chris-
tian,” said a Poacher in gaol to bimself,
“sarved the same as a bare 2-When he's
jugged, like I be."
SENTIMENT FOR WINTER. - The Old
Woman about this time may be expected
to Pick her Goose ; may the fall of snow
be unaccompanied by a rise in coal.
VERB.-"To Live" has but one tense-
the Imperfect.

DOPTING, partially, the entirely useless and excessively annoying
custom which induces his contemporaries to spoil their New Year's
Day issue with a recapitulation of the events of the past year,
in lieu of the usual scholarly, suggestive, or smart leading articles,
Mr. Punch devotes a portion of his invaluable space to a brief
but brilliant reference to the leading incidents of the last twelve
months. With his usual consideration and kindness, he begs that
no person will peruse this contrary to his wish, but Mr. Punch
warns every person who omits to read what follows, that he will
never know what he has lost. Inappropriately quoting
" He that is robbed, not knowing what is stolen,
Let him not know it, he's not robbed at all,"
Mr. Punch now calls upon Mnemosyne to dictate to Clio, and to
speak distinctly and mind her stops :
His Holiness the POPE discovered and announced his own likeness
to TOBIT, and some persons who do not usually agree with His
Holiness, approved this comparison, as TOBIT became supernaturally
blind for a season. The Challenger discovered that the little fish
SAMBOURNE. DEL
called the Gonotryx lived deeper in the Sea than had been supposed,
and a delighted and grateful universe burst into acclamation. The
PRINCE OF WALES became what Tom HooD called “ Chairman of the Glorious Apollos,” that is, Master of the Apollo Lodge; and the
LORD CHIEF JUSTICE gave Mr. Onslow and MR. WHALLEY a tremendous wigging, and fined each of them £100 for their over
zeal in the cause of their friend the ex-Claimant.
Convocation entirely smoothed the difficulties of those who disapprove the Athanasian Creed, by declaring that it really meant
nothing but what we all hold to be true, and that it is not at all menacing. All parties instantly embraced with a fervour that did
them infinite honour, and this redintegratio amoris enabled MR. GLADSTONE utterly to floor MR. MIALL, and execute a dance upon his
remains. The SHAH began to come, and became the most awful nuisance (it was not his fault, however), until he had visited Eng-
land, had caused fathers and husbands more botheration than Persia itself is worth, and had gone away amid the roars of cannon and the
execrations of Paterfamilias. All the hack prophets vented idiotic predictions about the Derby, which we need not say was won by a
horse which no one but Mr. Punch announced would be victor. The Alexandra Palace shared the fate of Persepolis after Alexander's
Feast. MR. HAWKINS invited a jury to find the ex-Claimant guilty of perjury.
Our American cousins very properly polished off the Modocs, in spite of sentimental ululation from folks who live very far out of
danger from any savages. The Russians, having quite satisfied the very good-natured LORD GRANVILLE that they were going to war with

to stare at the PRINCE and PRINCESS OF WALES. MR. FOLEY's noble statue of OUTRAM was placed near the York column, and
excited the admiration of everybody, but before the year was out the work was taken away, to go to India. ..

servants are locked up in the kitchen whilst it is in progress.
In many country places it is looked upon as a singular omen to
have to play at cards on New Year's Eve with a person who deals
left-handed. This prejudice has been handed down through many
generations, and those who watch the current of events are of
opinion that it will never yield to the advancing tide of civilisation
until the franchise in town and country is assimilated.
There are certain usages and customs connected with New Year's
Day which should never be neglected, if you do not wish to become
prematurely bald, or to find your clothes wearing out before you are
ready to replace them, or to lose the respect and esteem of all who
know you, during the ensuing year. Any book which deals with
Sports and Pastimes, or Popular Antiquities, or the Wisdom of our
Ancestors, will give full details of what it is indispensable to do on

MORE ECONOMY.
A HINT TO "GOVER’MENT." A CHEAP REMOUNT FOR LIGHT DRAGOONS!
Open and undisguised ; in this brief world
Of unavailing sentiment and sighs,
Fooling, perhaps, the best when all is done.
PENCILLINGS OF THE SEASON.
Two of Life's Stages, Art, at Christmas-tide,
In print-shop windows as exhibited,
Is ever wont to image-Youth and Age.
Youth as a fat, smiling, or sleeping babe,
Or else a toddling, pet, small girl or boy,
Meek-faced and mild to a burlesque degree.
Age, by old men in second infancy,
Who have out-lived their vices and their wits,
Bald, or with long white hair combed down their napes.
These, shaking hands, those, patting youngsters' heads,
Those others, clinking cups. Decrepit duffers,
Old humbugs shamming sad and solemn thought,
Bland, placid resignation, and content;
Or glowing radiant geniality,
Expressed in imbecile affected smiles.
They look so basely good! Old women, too,
In various aspects of fatuity,
Embody dotage. One crone sits and nods,
Dozing in an arm-chair, beside the fire.
Another, through a pair of spectacles,
Pores on the broad page of an open Book,
Much, evidently, comforted therein
By that blest word, “Mesopotamia."
Into such aged women and old men
As these, such youth as those will one day turn.
These popular, pathetic portraitures,
Which charm the many minds of spoony mould,
Provoke a strange repugnance in your own,
Prompting, too strongly, plunge in wild excess
And frantic dissipation. It is best,
From contemplation of these moving works,
To rush away unto a pantomime,
And list the Clown shout “Here we are again!”
And “How d'ye do to-morrow?” and behold
Outrageous acts of mad buffoonery,
TWO SORTS OF SAVAGES.
SMILES, accompanied, however, by shakes of the head, must have
been occasioned the other day by the subjoined paragraph, when
it met the eyes of readers of the Times :-
I “We have reason to believe that there is no foundation for the report pub-
lished in the New York Times, and reproduced in our Latest Intelligence,
to the effect that the British Consul at the Havannah has been instructed
immediately to assemble the British Naval Commanders in Cuban waters, as
England demands the punishment of GENERAL BURRIBL, the Governor of
Santiago."
The idea of even supposing Her Majesty's Government capable for
a moment of entertaining the thought of sending such instructions
as those to the British Consul at Havannah, betrays a most ludicrous
misconception of the character of a Ministry which calculates the
consequences of a spirited policy and counts the cost.
GENERAL BURRIEL is responsible for a most atrocious massacre
of several British subjects. But what if the Cuban authorities were
to rejeot a demand made by the British Naval Commanders in Cuban
waters for the punishment of GENERAL BURRIEL? The British Naval
Commanders would have either to put up with the refusal, or to
bombard Havannah. In the former case, they would stultify them.
selves and their country; in the latter, their action might embroil
us with Spain. It is lucky for GENERAL BURRIEL, or for the
Havannah 'people, that Cuba is the dependency of a State still,
though distracted with civil war, capable, as an enemy, of giving
trouble, instead of being such another kind of territory as an island
of savages in the South Pacific.

NEW POLICE FOR PANTOMIMES.
THE Officers of Law and Order, the Police, at this
time of the year, are wont, impersonated in all the
various pantomimes, to be upheld to the respect and
veneration of the British Public. On the stage they
receive what certain blockheads who suppose “ovation"
to have something to do with eggs, would call "a nightly
ovation," but for the circumstance that they are usually
pelted, not with eggs, but with vegetables. A voyage
on the river, on one of the late fine days, from London
Bridge to Waterloo in a penny steamer, attested the ex-
traordinary mildness of the season, and brought into
view a Thames Police Station. This suggested the
possibility of an improvement, in the way of addition
and novelty, on the customary pantomimic exhibition of
the Police. Occasion might be taken to introduce, in
some scene suitable to their agency, a number of aquatic
policemen distinguished by peculiarities indicative of
design and adaptation to an amphibious existence.
There is also a fluviatile officer of the Corporation of
London, who, if exhibited in connection with the Thames
Police, would, no doubt, afford amusement. Good fun
could 'unquestionably be got out of the Water Bailiff,
represented as organised after a fashion presumably
suitable to his official life. Both the Water Bailiff and
the Water Police present themselves to the eye of imagi-
nation as a sort of Mermen, having lower extremities
analogous to those of fishes or seals ; thus exhibiting
affinities to the finny or the flappery tribes. Their
function may be conceived to be principally that of
swimming after loose fish. The idea of Water Babies
was pretty and graceful in a high degree, to which a
proportional amount of merriment would not fail to be
created by effectively dramatising Water Bobbies.

CANTATA FOR CHRISTMAS-TIDE.
Recitatico.
TAIS festive season is, we know,
The season of gratuities;
Of paying more than what we owe,
And gorging superfluities.
Aria.
Christmas comes but once a year ;
When it comes, it costs us dear.
Brings us heaps of heavy bills,
And a lot of other ills;
Christmas troublesome appeals,
Christmas meetings, Christmas meals,
Christmas games and fooleries,
Christmas toys and Christmas trees,
Christmas carols at your doors,
Christmas boxes, Christmas bores.
HEARTY DEARS.
An exclamation uttered by Othello, in a particular
sense, is capable of being applied in a wider meaning,
and therein suggested to parents and guardians, just now,
at this festive season of exercise of the digestive organs :
"O!
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites.”
The knife and fork, to use an elegant euphemism,
which very many young ladies, as well as their brothers
home for the holidays, may, about this time, be seen to
play, not only at dinner, but also at supper afterwards,
to say nothing of previous breakfast, lunch, and tea,
cannot but, on the part of many of their seniors, excite
an emotion of envious regret, neatly expressible, as above,
in the words of Othello.

« The Prussian Royal Order of Merit of the Civil Class has

THE GREAT."
STOOP, old Sicamber! Bend the neck
Thou still so stiff hast borne:
With star and ribbon while they deck
Thy gaberdine well-worn.
True THOMAS, say, if, prophet-souled,
Thou e'er hadst second-sight
Of thyself ribboned, starred, enrolled
In Prussian ranks a knight ?
Sartor resartus ! Shall we note,
As men clothes-moulded be,
This buttoned-up, black-eagled coat
Work any change in thee ?
Or art thou timber all too tough
For tailors' dummy hollow;
Though Prussia lead court-suit, too rough
Prussian court suit to follow ?
Methinks I see thee-face to face,
With him of blood and iron,
Owning PRINCE BISMARCK of the race
Whom verities environ.
No wind-bag this, thy brother Knight
Who the black-eagle bears :
A man of facts—with shams to fight
Where'er they shame the stars.
And this grim, grey old Emperor,
Whose back no years can curve,
Methinks is a grand master dour
Enough for thee to serve.
I see Drill-Sergeant FRIEDRICI's ghost
The Tabagie below
Leaving, his bear-hug as a host
Upon thee to bestow.
“RITTER CARLYLE, so rauchen Sie
Tabak? So gut: ich auch.”
And Bear-King and Ber-serk I see,
In clouds of kindred rauch.
The clouds that from thy midnight clay,
And midnight-musing brain,
Have blended, wholesomely alway,
Strong scent, and strengthening strain;
Breathed the keen breath of foroeful truth
That still inspires thy page
How good work seed-corn is of youth
That would reap har’st of age.
“No lie shall live: no man by lies :
God's debts are paid at last:
He with the Devil's coin that tries
To pay them, will be cast!”
Plain truths-so plain to be descried,
Unmarked we pass them by :
Truths that bed-rid by Error's side
In the mind's lazaret lie.
Truths ne'er so old but new they show,
When some clear tongue and brain
Drives home on all what all men know,
Till faiths are facts again.
This was thy work, old Chelsea seer ;
And well it hath been done;
And honour's crown on thy grey hair
Sits well at set of sun.
Our mother England has no stars
For soldiers of the Pen:
With us such honours spring from wars
Watered with blood of men.
Then let us rather smile then sneer,
When from the Vaterland,
Whose thought to us he has brought near,
There is stretched forth a hand,
To pin the badge of merit fair
On CARLYLE's manly breast :
The star can shed no honour there,
'Tis honoured there to rest.
HEREAS Complaint hath been made to the
High Court of Punch that he hath in
some sort wronged the Venerable ARCH-
DEACON DENISON, and whereas CÆSAR
doth not wrong. Let it be known, then,
that in a Sermon preached by the Arch-
deacon at St. Ethelburga's, and recently
alluded to by Mr. Punch, the former
reverend gentleman, in alleging that “confession” would secure the joys most
of all to be desired, did not use the word in the Roman-Catholic sense, but he
designed to imply confession of the faith of the Church. This correction Mr.
Punch is as happy to make as he is to perceive, from its being desired, that the
other idea is repudiated. Then Mr. Punch is informed that it was owing to the
Archdeacon's not perceiving the stole (which had been laid on the edge of the
pulpit) that he did not put it on until his discourse was somewhat advanced.
That he kissed it, is not denied. Our friends the Ritualists perform the cere-
mony of kissing the stole when they put it on, and also when they take it off.
Whether this process be not a violation of the statute De Osculis, cited by the
Reverend Grand Master Beaumanoir in the case of Rebecca of York, is open to
consideration ; but in the meantime Mr. Punch is happy to show that even
against such an enemy of the faith as Ritualism he employs no weapons save
those of truth and ridicule.
CREMATION.
SIR HENRY THOMPSON's remarkable article on this subject, in the Contem-
porary Review, furnishes the Spiritualistic Table-rappers with a new theory,
of which, if they are only half sharp, they will speedily avail themselves. SIR
H. THOMPSON writes-
"Our mahogany of to-day has been many negroes in its turn, and before the African
existed, was integral portions of many a generation of extinct species.”
The mahogany table is then evidently “all alive O!” and only wants just so
much galvanic force applied to it as may bring its dormant powers into action.
The Mediums may thank SIR HENRY for his words, and Sir Punch for having
drawn attention to them. If Cremation should ever become the rule (and we
take this earliest opportunity of saying that we trust it may-more of this
anon), the first Cemetery, or, rather, Crematory, would be in Berners Street.

Mr. Busby. “ MANY THANKS, MY DEAR LADY, BUT I COULDN'T EAT ANOTHER MORSEL !”
THE VATICAN HATTER.
Hats, hats, red hats! Who'll buy, who'll buy ?
My red hats, with Church crowns inside 'em!
Come, reverend heads, my measures try!
Mine is the sole shop to provide 'em!
The old-established Vatican hatter,
The red hat is my specialtie !
The shape of head don't so much matter;
There's but one kind of head for me, -
That's the head with no tongue to chatter,
No brain to think, no eyes to see;
Many stone walls 'twill have to batter,
So thick enough for ram must be.
There's only one point I insist on;
The head must, in no case, be long ;
And I prefer such skulls my list on,
As while they 're thick are aught but strong.
A contradiction in conditions,
For human brain-pans, some may say,
And, doubtless, naturalist physicians
Might be found ready with their “nay;"
But 'mong the Vatican hatter's missions
Is this, by voice ex Cathedrá,
Irreconcileable positions
To reconcile, in non-natural way.
So I proclaim, from my old shop,
The only shop to change unknown-
The drip of Time's all-wearing drop
Eats not one grain of PETER's stone
The heads my hats are like to hit
Most hard and yet most soft must be :
So hard, they'll turn the shafts of wit
At my infallibility;
So soft, they'll mould to suit the sit
Of any head-gear I decree;
Strong “ les plus lourdes Salettes,"* to fit,
And round or square, as pleases me.
While such the heads that I require,
My safest custom is in Rome.
Your English heads have too much fire
To be safe 'neath St. Peter's dome.
You ne'er know but they 'll flare about
Some brands of learning, logic, law,
Such as red hats as sure put out
In Latin pates, as fire damp straw.
But when your English heads from doubt
Pass to omnivorous faith and awe,
My measure they stretch quite without,
And longer bows than mine will draw!
So in the recent red-hat rain
Wonder not if no scarlet brim
Has fallen, in the feverish brain
Of MANNING the wild-fire to dim.
'Tis not thus Pro Nono tries
To quench his English Roman candle,
Whose fire-balls, for their shine and size,
So shame Rome's, they cause quite a scandal,
Bedazzle ANTONELLI's eyes,
And almost singe the sacred sandal,
An Irish head its hat may boast, ---
Hot as they are they 're rarely hard,-
Your CUMMING man is for a post
Which MANNING come could never guard.
Your English convert's zeal is such
As TALLEYRAND had styled de trop;
.Salette, an iron head-piece; also a notorious place of pilgrimage, like
Lourdes, and Paray-le-Monial.

THE PLUSH AND THE PEN.
So please Your Excellency, Mr. Punch, read this :-
"THE MARRIAGE OF MIBS GLADSTONE.—The Echo is re-
quested to state that MR. GLADSTONE's remarks on the occasion
of his daughter's marriage were spoken in a private room at
Hawarden Rectory, and to neighbours only.”
Thus you perceive that a speech, which you doubtless
perused and admired, was published, not having been
intended for publication. How did this happen? It is
impossible to say; but let any public gentleman, who
does not want to see his private table-talk in print, mind
what he says in the presence of shoulder-knots, other
than casual ones of the regimental species. Of course,
if JOHN THOMAS sent you a report of his master's re-
marks, you would naturally suppose he had done as he
was bid : and, probably, the paragraph which I have
submitted to your notice attests the results of that
education which has been already given to some of those
whom MR. LOWE once called our future masters;
although those some in particular may, at present, be
our servants.
Receive, Sir, the salutations of the season from your
own obedient seryant to command, whom call, as school-
boys cry,

BOHN v. BASS.
“At a recent meeting of the Students' Literary Society in
connection with St. Andrew's University, the debate for the
evening was, "Whether are Bohn's translations or Bass's beer
the greater benefit to students ?'"
THE subject, it is added, naturally called forth a lively
discussion, and at the close the meeting decided in favour
of the Translations, by an overwhelming majority ?
Wo grieve to say, and every right-minded person will
share our disappointment, that such was not the con-
clusion to which the students came just before the
Christmas vacation. They “decided in favour of the
beer,” but only—and we cling to this as leaving us

THE following extract from a Newspaper contains two statements,
of which the first in order seems incredible, and the second is sur-

WHIPPINGHAM WARBLERS.
On December the 28th, the children of Whipping-
ham School (isn't the name simply perfect ?) sang in
the Inner Hall of the Pavilion at Osborne, The First
Grief. Can't we imagine what the first grief would be
at Whippingham ? Of course it is a school where every
book is illustrated with cuts. We should like to see
exhibited the original "block" of Whippingham.
The School-house itself is, we venture to say, beauti-
fully situated in a grove of birches. DR. BIRCH was the
PRINCE OF WALES's tutor, wasn't he? And Whipping
ham is on the Royal domain at Osborne.
The children then sang Now is the Time. What
for? Clearly, the answer is, " for Whipping 'em.”
Another of their melodious efforts was The Pilgrims
Perhaps this was a Swish air.

Nature at Question.
SOME correspondence which has lately appeared in
the Times, on the subject of Vivisection, brings to mind
a piece of advice which LORD BACON gave to those who
were devoting themselves, in his day, to the then
incipient science of Chemistry. He recommended them
to prosecute their researches in that department of
knowledge by, as it were, torturing nature. Physio-
logists have adopted this recommendation literally in
the pursuit of their inquiries: but, whereas the torture
of lifeless matter has led to many great discoveries,
very few results of any consequence have been obtained

A CASE OF CONSCIENCE.
The Times, the other day, announced &
very decided case of -
“CONSCIENCE Money.-The CHANCELLOR
OF THE EXCHEQUER announces the receipt of
u ten-pound note from B.,' for Income-tax.”
"B." stands for Booby. That, in all
probability, is all that needs be said about
ihat initial, in the above place. And yet
may not “B.” possibly mean “ Brick-
layer," or some other description of Work-
ing-man, in the receipt of wages amounting
in the year to a sum far above the annual
income of many an official Clerk, many a
Clergyman, Solicitor, or Medical Man ?
It is certainly just conceivable that such
a member of the working classes may
feel ashamed of going untaxed by an im-
post which subjects other, and poorer, if
cleanlier and more respectable - looking
members of those classes, to peculiar
taxation. The sense of being thus un-
justly favoured may, perhaps, embitter the
tea which such an one drinks the cheaper
for the direct taxation of those others.
“B.” can hardly signify “Bibax” in the
sense of a tippler; because, Working-men
who consume intoxicating fluids do, at least,
in a measure, tax themselves, and con-
tribute something, if not their share, to
the national expenses.

TO EVERY EDITOR
ABLE Director of Journal, we say, man,
Surely enough is as good as a feast,
Do let's have done with this bother of HAYMAN,
'Tisn't amusing, dear friend, in the least.
Over and over we've had the old story,
Which in two lines it is easy to state:
Tories appointed an orthodox Tory
Successor to ARNOLD, and TEMPLE, and Tait.
What is the good of discussing it sulkily?
How could the thing be except as it is ?
· If in a glass you put acid to alkali,
What, nomme de garce, can result but a fizz ?
Why should the Doctor be loftily gibbeted,
Like his old namesake? He's not in disgrace.
In plenty of Schools where Free Thought is prohibited,
He'd be a very fit man for his place.
But Rugby must stick to her Broad Church traditions --
TAIT, TEMPLE, and ARNOLD built not “for a day."
There's room in the kingdom for all sorts of Missions-
Announce “No more words on this subjcct," we pray,

SENSIBLE MUNIFICENCE.
THE British Army, in general, cannot be
considered to be overpaid, and it must be
confessed that a very moderate remunera-
tion is received in proportion to the services
rendered by that particular division of our
Forces, which remains on constant skir-
mishing duty in the streets and about our
premises, ever on the watch, and ready to
act immediately against our domestio
enemies, the dangerous classes. No reason-
able person, who has a due regard for the
security of his goods and chattels, and the
safety of his skin, can think the amount
of pay assigned to the National Property
and Life Guards (Blue) excessive. Be it,
then, suggested that gentlemen and ladies
in the giving vein, and blessed with the
means of free effusion from that vessel,
might do well, at the giving season of the
year especially, to follow the example thus
recorded in the Hampshire Independent :-
"A New Year's GIFT FOR THE POLICE.-
Mrs. GENERAL ROGERS, of Highfield, bas gene-
rously forwarded a sum of $10 to MR. SUPERIN-
TENDENT BREARY, for division among the mem-
bers of the borough police force, for a New Year's
gift.”
Too generally the only acknowledgment
accorded, at the festive season of the year,
to our gallant defenders from thieves and
ruffians, consists in the complimentary sort
of Christmas-box which they are wont to
be treated with on Boxing-night and there-
after nightly for some weeks, in being ridi-
culed, for the diversion of the juvenile
British Public, and the pickpockets, on
the stage. At Southampton, however, the
“Bobbies" have, this year, obtained a
more suitable recognition, in the shape of
certain “ bob," the dividend of the ten
pounds given to be distributed among them
by MRS. ROGERS.
CANONICAL CUSTOMS.
IN connection with the approaching
marriage of the DUKE OF EDINBURGI,
according to the Greek rite, it has been
stated that, in the Greek Church, a monk,
however high his position, is not allowed to
perform the matrimonial service. That
rite can be administered only by a married
priest. DR. JOHNSON once improvised a
famous parody on the inconsiderately ad-
mired line:-
“Who rules o'er freemen should himself be free."
Undoubtedly, at that rate,-
“Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.”
A REGULAR BRITON.
And then the Greek Church speaks
reason in virtually declaring that:-
“IT WAS MR. ROBINSON GAVE ME THAT Boat, AUNTY !”
“ AND DID YOU KISS HIM FOR IT, ARTHUR ?"
“ Who marries others must himself be married."
“No, INDEED! As if Mey WERE IN THE HABIT OF KISSING BACH OTHER, AUNTY !” Our own Established Church knows of
no such canon ; makes a reverend bachelor

BEST SIGN OF THE SEASON.
Of the mildness of the Season
Many a pretty proof we've seen;
Blossoms plum and apple trees on,
Daisies blooming on the green,
Primroses and periwinkles,
Violets, too, on banks that blow,
Hard by where the sheep-bell tinkles,
Lambkins bleat, and heifers low :
Birds that raise untimely voices;
Song and missel tbrush that sing,
So as when their kind rejoices
O'er a fine fat slug in spring.
Toads and frogs, from winter's slumber,
Which on sunny days awake;
Ere a few more hours they number
They may find out their mistake.

THE SHAME OF STROUD.
O DIELP, THOMAS MOORE, here's a sin and a shame,
Lend a hint from the verse you indignantly writ
When John RUSSELL, fatigued with political game,
Thought of turning philosopher, poet, or wit.
Says you—and uncommonly handsome you wrote-
“Thou, born of a RUSSELL, whose instinct to run
The accustomed career of thy sires" — need we quote
That elegant bit about “ eagle and sun”?
SEPULTURE AND SENTIMENT.
PEOPLE accustomed to regard the question of choice between
“cremation" and interment sentimentally, might as well consider
what it amounts to in the view of enlightened sentiment. It is simply
the question whether there is anything more disagreeable in the im-
mediate than there is in the gradual decomposition of organic remains.
By cremation, properly managed, all the constituents of the thing
burnt, except the earthy particles, are sent in gaseous forms up a
tall chimney into the atmosphere, and the skies. In case of inter-
ment they leak out partly as gases into the surrounding air, which
you breathe; partly as liquids into the neighbouring earth; thus
into any wells you may have sunk therein: and so into the water
which you drink.-Which of these alternative conditions of things
does Sentiment deem the nicer? If Sentiment approve of a wine that
contains some body, is it equally partial to water capable of the
same description? Can Sentiment be pleased to see commons and
open spaces progressively converted into cemeteries; and, if not, how
does Sentiment relish the prospect of their ultimate abolition which
must result from the continual spread of population on a limited
area ? The spirits of the wise may well sit in the clouds and mock
us; for there they are where their bodies ought also to be, resolved
into their innoxious elements instead of entering into the lungs and
digestive organs of those who persist in putting corruptible matter
in the wrong places. There are Churches in which, surrounded as
they are by crowded churchyards, memento mori is addressed now
and then to the ear indeed, but always to the nose. Cremation ap-
pears to be called for with forcible demonstrations by those who
want it. The dead are at least doing all they can to force their
claims on our attention.
But THOMAS, O Thomas, what, what shall we say
To a borough that should be eternally proud
That your RUSSELL sat for it-and yet goes astray-
O what shall be done to the Voters of Stroud ?
With the broad Ajax-shield of the Ballot on high
(Periphrastic, you know, Tom, fortelling a story'),
Bad Stroud has slunk sneaking, so slavish and sly,
And where RUSSELL hath sat there is sitting a Tory!

Let this sentence proceed from the Populi Vox,

The name of base troud. Let it sleep in the-Box !”

quiet time, not a bit. Out comes Mrs. Woodcutter, with the impulse
of her early pantomime reminiscences strong within her, from
behind the bed-curtains, and excitedly warns him, points to a blood-
stain on the pillow, calls on him to escape with her, when enter
Robert. “Ha!” exclaims her sulky step-son, “what are you here
for ?" Well, her presence there is, to say the least of it, odd. The
family, however, are none of them very good at excuses, and she
assures Robert that she only came to give the stranger a night-cap.
“ It may be 80,” says sulky Robert, thoughtfully, and actually
accepts the explanation as satisfactory. In fact, clever, except in
the matter of posing, as he is, professionally, as a Robber, Robert is,
out of business, rather a fool than otherwise, or why believe his
step-mother about that night-cap? They both leave Raymond, who
finding he is unable to escape, goes to bed again, and directly he has
settled himself comfortably, enters the sulky Robert for the third
time, and recommences with his carving-knife. Being, as before,
a long time posing and taking aim, Mrs. Woodcutter seizes the
opportunity to prod Raymond sharply in the ribs from behind
her favourite hiding-place, the bed-curtains (where she has again
concealed herself, having entered unperceived by that sulky idiot,
Robert), and Raymond, springing up, seizes the ruffian for the third
time. His excuse is now, that he "only came up to say that supper
was ready."
Then they go to supper, and Agnes, and the Duenna, are brought
in, and Raymond sups with Agnes, and the Blood-Stained Bandits
make a hearty supper off bread-and-milk in wooden bowls. Then
the Woodcutter gives his guest the poisoned wine, and Mrs. Wood-

WEDDING PRESENTS.
“ The ladies of Edinburgh have resolved to present the
PRINCESS MARIE with an album containing portraits of Scottish
artists, on the occasion of her marriage with the DUKE OF EDIN-
BURGH."
What are the ladies of Dublin going to do on this
happy occasion ? A handsome album might be made of
the portraits of Irish wits or Irish orators; for we fear
the Grand Duchess would fail to appreciate the photo-

THE DIE-HARDS AND THEIR COLOURS.

“Between one and two o'clock to-day (Friday, Jan. 23rd) was
seen a small military detachment, in uniform, marching from
Cannon Street to the Mansion House. A field-officer, three other
officers, and about eight non-commissioned officers and men, were
taking to their final resting-place in St. Paul's Cathedral, the
old colours of the 57th Regiment-the West Middlesex-the
Die-hards.' They were cordially received by the LORD MAYOR,
and with equal cordiality at the Cathedral, where, after a short,
impressive ceremony, the colours were placed on its walls. They
were the colours of the Crimea, and especially of Inkermann.
They were accompanied on this their last march by the condition
that no expense was thereby to be entailed on the public.'”

POEM ON THE DUKE'S DAY.
[MR. Punch feared that the Poets were not coming out “in the
way that might have been expected,” as folks say in Japan. How-
ever, he has been favoured with an early copy of the following com-
position, which the Bard (surely he need not be named) had a double
motive for writing--affection for the Royal Family, and gratitude
for a recent pension. He considers this a gem of the first water.]
This is a day we never saw before,
For both our Princes stand on Russia's shore,
One with a wife of whom 't must be allowed
His Royal Highness is most justly proud;
The other bending to a gracious bride,
To whom for life he will be shortly tied;
Then soar, my muse, on pinions glad and free,
And to the great occasion equal be.
Things have not always been as we could wish,
Russia and England have fried other fish.
In the Crimea both their swords have crossed,
Where honour, if not won, was never lost.
Nor are we sure that Russia doth not mean
Some day to march upon the Indian scene;
But be these memories gently laid away
Upon this happy and well-omen's day,
Remembering, and I say it without scoff,
Sufficient for the day's the ill thereof.
I don't mean that, of course-repress the sneer
No ill can come when saffron Hymen's near,
Combined with Cupid-yet again I pause.
We live beneath the sway of Christian laws,
And if those heathen beings I invoke,
It is that I may point the harmless joke.
I know full well that such old classic ties
The Church of England does not recognise.
Great crowds of persons of most various ranks
Have lately gathered upon Neva's banks,
An interesting sight they did behold,
Water was taken in a bowl of gold,
A cross was then inserted in the wave,
And a chief-priest did benediction crave.
The rite was fanciful, but harmless, sure,
And gave much satisfaction to the poor.
Our Princes were not 'mid the concourse, but
Stood at a window, which, I hope, was shut,
For, till acclimatised, 'tis hard to bear
The shocking keenness of the Russian air,
And stern bronchitis, quite impartial, brings
Grief to the throats of Princes and of Kings.
One novel thought my Muse's wit inflames-
Who ever heard a blessing on the Thames ?
Especially when manufacturing smells
Prompt, not a blessing, friends, but something else-
Not that I tolerate a childish curse,
But claim some licence for a sportive verse.
To-day, my Muse, in matrimonial bands
ALFRED and MARIE swathe their royal hands.
He's bound in Russia, so, for that, is she-
A bondage of the happiest liberty:
Were it but etiquette, the hour would win
His sweetest tune on his best violin;
But, as good Dr. Primrose used to say,
Some graver thoughts befit the marriage day,
DEAN STANLEY's sermon seems to me a boon
Much more becoming than a lively tune.
Now, we'll suppose the ceremonial said,
The crowns suspended o'er each youthful head,
The CZAR protrudes his hand, and gives the kiss,
Wishing his children every sort of bliss,
All the Princesses lavish kindly smiles,
The bright tear sparkling in each eye the whiles ;
Frank ALBERT EDWARD, laughing, whispers, “ ALF,
You, like myself, have got a Better Half!"
Then all the cannons give an awful roar,
Flash flies a telegram to England's shore,

How his gallant old goose-quill he draws with a flourish, Once it proved pluck to brave the Old Lord of the Wave,
To whose Cross-keys the flags of all nations were lowered,
Proclaiming his view, which to doubt he holds treason,
When he ruled all seas over, from Euxine to Dover,
And for which Faith and Love, alike, Liberals must nourish. And bore down on John Bull, that piratical rover,
As an Eagle might swoop on a wren over-powered.
Man or cock, I maintain, 'tis the strife shows the strain,
And since John first wore steel-not u'en scoffers can question-
Now that flag calls in vain, on France, Italy, Spain,
And more vainly still on the iron-clad German,
Never great fight has been, but this small cock was seen,
Their ensigns to lower, in respect to her power,
In the thick of the row, pecker up, and spurs keen,
And under her lee in submission to cower,
Or atip-toe, and straining his throat to congestion.
And to take for sealed orders her old captain's firman.
So shrill chanticleering, for ears dull of hearing,
And it needs little pluck, now she's down on her luck,
As for more normal ears might, at times, seem lost labour,
To tackle the old craft, worm-eaten and crazy ;
But his note still the true British Cock-doodle-doo -
One shot in her quarter, between wind and water,
Every man under law free to think, speak, and do,
Of the bolts in her rotten old sides would be starter,
What pleasing himself, does no wrong to his neighbour.
And her crew is disheartened, commander grown hazy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

And now the Big Bismarck, about to set his mark
Upon the old craft, fifes a-scream, drums a-rattle,
Boarding-nettings up-knotted, big guns double-shotted,
Grave, grim-visaged crew at their stations allotted,
Bears down, huge and heavy, a-taunto for battle!
Let him fight his own fight, God will stand by the right,
He can manage his battle without any backer,
Do his own talking, writing, his own steering, fighting,
His own tacking, wearing, his own signal-lighting,
Choose his own time to ram and steam faster or slacker.
So, my JOHNNY, why poke such a very bad joke,
As when you propose, at this grave German crisis,
Your own cockle-shelly to steer in the mêlée,
And your small pocket handkerchief sail to bid belly,
Like a dingey behind a big barge on the Isis ?
There's a voice from the past-"Cobbler, stick to your last."
And a fable that tells frogs can ne'er into bulls swell,
And a proverb commanding each tub to find landing
Upon its own,--well, let us say,-"understanding,"
So keep your cockboat clear of the Big Bismarck's full swell!

This Gold Coast war I must declare
A most unhappy, sad affair;
We will not press upon the foe
Further than justice bids us go:
But while we fight, as fight we must,
In WOLSELEY We have perfect trust.
More legislation, friends, because-
Because the nation wants more laws.
Touching the Education Act,
We don't yet know enough, in fact,
But the small things that drive folks queasy,
I think we'll manage to make easy.
Strange how they've stuck to their monopolies,
The Local Swells of this Metropolis,
But we'll attempt it, done or undone,
A better Government for London.
And some improvements we'll pursue
At Oxford and at Cambridge, too.
And thus new brightness shall arise
In those twin sparklers, “England's Eyes."
Of course among my list of bounties
Is wider suffrage in the counties,
But on this point the public mind
Is, up to now, I think, purblind.
When people understand the dodge,
We'll see what we can do for HODGE,
But now, my brethren, list to me,
Attention for our L. $. D.
Our Tory friends we banged and basted,
And said the nation's cash they wasted.
Well, we've not saved such awful sums
As we could wish, but there be plums-
This year (excuse the rhyme), you villians,
We'll show a Surplus of Five Millions.
Ten years have I kept up my pecker
As Chancellor of the Exchequer;
So when I paint its prospects brightly
You'll know that I'm not speaking lightly.
Local Taxation, I conceive,
I can reform and 'eke relieve,
But here's the honey, lads of wax,
I will take off the Income-tax.

Who brought it down from six to three ;
But what is BOBBY's joy to his
Who wipes it out? (That's one for Diz.)
But more! you don't know half our gumption :
We'll cheapen things of Home Consumption,
Giving, as far as we are able,
What BRIGHT has called “Free Breakfast Table."
Forty-two years of public life
Have made me rather tired of strife,
And I should like my time to close
With my friend Homer in repose,
But each must do the thing he can,
And for the present I'm your Man.
We're told the Liberals are a pest,
“Endangering," “ worrying,' and the rest.
I will not coarsely fling the lie,
But all such charges I deny,
And say each Institution stands
Firmer through work of Liberal hands,
And we have given you nobler cause
To reverence the Throne and Laws.
Now, choose. I'll serve you, if you will,
With all I have of strength and skill.

How easy does the task appear,
Impossible so many a vear!!
Nor shall your incomes only be,
But breakfast-table, also, free.
How, with a fight for place in view,
Statesmen find out what they can do!
But soft, green friends, too prone to trust,
Oft promises prove pie's mere crust.
That income should be taxed no more,
Once on a time you heard before.
On that pretence was duty laid
Upon“ succession," and prepaid.
But when relief, thus bought, fell due,
Dishonoured was the bill-mind you !
The thing could not be managed. Why?
“Because it can't,” was the reply.
And whichsoever side shall win,
These office keep, or those come in,
If the redress now promised, then
They fail not to refuse again,
Upon the renovated plea
Of its impossibility,
They 'll disappoint, with glad surprise,
The expectations of the wise.

WE doubt, till doubt in the most sceptic yields
To the chill certainty of death, at last :
Death, that has reached him through the four-fold shields
By courage, use, hope, love, about him cast.

Another brain, athirst for knowledge, stayed :
Another manly life and iron will,

The ready question. That our maps may stand
Their blanks filled in with names and figures, wrung,
A life for each, from Nature's close-clenched hand ?
To help us widen wastes-e'en now so wide-
Of brutish dwellers, and, more brutish far,
Of fierce man-hunters, who a-hunting ride,
Dogg'd by worse curses than death, dearth, or war ?
To set new problems more hot brains to fire ?
Hurl more high hearts on desperate emprize ?
To find new fields for Christian desire
To teach and train, to raise and civilise ?
With all these wastes, that waster, wider grow,
Amid our whited homes, and weeded fields;
These savage hordes, embruted, blind, and low-
The wild root, that wild fruit, uncultured yields,
Was there not work for all hearts of his aim
Whose loss we mourn, on this our heathenry ?
More ignorance to teach, vice to reclaim,
Than Central Afric hides, 'twixt sea and sea ?
As strange discoveries to be made here,
Of unexpected dearth for harvests kind :
Of more unlooked-for spring-heads, sweet and clear,
Where drought or bitterness we looked to find ?
It may be some will say his work was waste,
As the waste realms, wild races, where 'twas wrought;
No harvest to his seed or sickle traced,
Of food for higher life, or richer thought.
But are such men vouchsafed unto their race
To be swept by as naught? Is Heaven so free
In lending greatness, or are we so base
In its appraisement, that “what use ? " must be
The measure of our judgments, when we hear
Of some great soul that, on its work undone,
Hath sunk aweary, with the goal so near,
Seemed but a hand to stretch, and it was won ?
By their own scale great souls gauge things and men ;
Their ways and weights are not our weights and ways;
Only their vision goes beyond our ken,
Reaching to larger lights, diviner days.
“What good ?” 'Tis well the question should remain
Unanswered, to our asking, who so use
Mammon's equivalents of loss and gain,
We deem things worthless which that test refuse.
“No good to thee,” this forfeit life may say,
“And yet all good to me, and souls like mine,
That give the lie to doctrines of the day,
And devilish hold much they call divine.

GLORIES OF THE OUTWARD WORLD ?”.
Chorus of Admiring Ladies. “ WHENCE, O WHENCE, INDEED, MR. HONEYCOMB !"
Master Tommy. “P'RAPS THE LITTLE BEGGAR WAS AFRAID HE'D BE BOILED!"
So this bold diver, in mid-Afric's sea,
Un-mapped, un-plumbed, would sink, and re-emerge,
Till men thought what had been again must be,
And still watched for his rising o'er the verge.
This time he will not rise, till that great day
That brings all men's deserts and deeds to scale ;
Then, blest the souls that as true weight shall weigh,
As that which warmed this husk, so worn and pale,
That dropped off, almost as in sight he came
Of evening rest, and honours fairly won;
Bare heads, to welcome back the shrivelled frame,
As befits life well lived, and work well done!
“Knowledge, like other life, springs, fruits, seeds, dies
To live; nor seeks our judgment of its worth;
Prized or unprized, alike, its harvest lies
In hand of Heaven-to garner, or give forth.
“And they that sow the seed, oft see no fruit;
Nay, oft lie dead or ere the bud is blown:
But not the less they dig about the root,
Trusting in growth for good, where seed is sown."
So trusted he, this Scotsman, humbly born,
Yet of a lineage so proud and high,
It brooked no ill-gain bring its poortith scorn,
No ill-deed shame its cottier ancestry.
Through life's rough places winning upward way,
Feeling new strength with each new height attained,
He girt him life at duty's call to lay,
Nor e'er looked back, nor hand from plough refrained.
Since thirty years ago and three, began
The labour of his travel to and fro
The blank zone that across mid-Afrio ran,
Whose mysteries he gave us, first, to know,
Like one who for shell'd pearl or coral's wreath,
In the sea's un-sunned depth adventures leap,
And to the watchers seems to stay beneath
Longer than living lungs their breath could keep,
Then rises, pale and proud, and shakes his hair
Free from the brine, and strikes through cheers to land,
And for past dangers little seems to care
For ipv of the rare treasures in his hand, -
THE OLDEST CANDIDATE.
We do hope that Captain the Honourable RANDOLPH STEWART will
be returned for Kirkcudbright (pronounced something like “Kirkoo-
bery," we believe) without opposition. His gallant services are
known to us all ; but it is his tremendous age that chiefly entitles
him to the reverence and suffrage of his countrymen. He tells us
in his address :
“I was born within sight of the glorious old Stewartry hills, and come
before you as one intimately connected with the Stewartry and Galloway gene-
rally for a period extending over many centuries, whilst in more recent years
my father was your Lord-Lieutenant, and my great-uncle your representative

that may be so called by a figure of speech,
because, only just able to support them-
selves, they consume nothing in comparison
with the rest of the community? The
consuming classes certainly include the
nobility, the gentry, the beneficed clergy,
and all opulent merchants, traders, and pro-
fessional men. They likewise include all
the opulent portion of the working classes,
the chief consumers of butchers' meat and
"intoxicating liquors.” Does MR. GÖSCHEN
mean to say that the abolition of the In-
come-tax will be no relief to them? Then
all that can be said is that it ought to.
CANDIDATES AND COLLISIONS.
PEACE, as well as War, has its returns
of killed and wounded. Street traffic is
attended with great slaughter of people run
over, and a still heavier butcher's bill is
incurred through railway arrangements.
The Times, in an article relative to a late
homicidal collision, propounds a question
which Mr. Punch has raised over and over
again; but it will always bear repetition
as long as Railway Directors, instead of
abiding at their proper work, or in their
proper station, continue to engage them-
selves in keeping watch over their mere
pecuniary interests in another place :-
“Have not Railway Chairmen and Managers
and Directors more than enough to occupy all
their time in the sole management of their lines
without canvassing for seats in Parliament?”
Just now, at election time, the appeal
addressed, as above, to the country by the
Times, is particularly timeous. It suggests
an answer plain to the meanest capacity,
except that of a railway shareholder, mean
in the sense of sordid, so much so, as to
regard nothing but money. From that
answer the constituent stupid enough not
to know whom to vote for may yet be
sufficiently wise to be able to infer whom not
to vote for. The Vote and Interest of the
free and independent British Elector should
be favours for which no Railway Official
need apply. If any exception to the rule
thus proposed were made, it should be on-
behalf of subordinate officials, engine-
drivers, stokers, and pointsmen, who, with
regard to legislation for public safety, could
contribute something valuable to the wis-
dom of Parliament. But circumstances
oblige these men to stick to their duties,
and would not enlightened public opinion
limit their superiors also to their own?

Or a hundred-years-since clothes.

As abroad played all about :
And some foreign tricks are catching,
And, if caught, must be stamped out.
And we doubt if your eleven

Now the time's come to set foot down,
And we doubt if you 're the man.

Quick to raise, or swell, a squall,
But you have been too ready
To fight shy, and sing small.
“You boast you've kept the Club up
At small cost, and all squared,

But all 's not saved that's spared.

And those they gave no quarter,
Salute them, on their shelves !

For yourself, never fear it-
You will win back all you've lost.
But Outings, after Innings,
Are good for every side;
If cricket were all winnings,
Games, not balls, would be shied.

Where's the eleven could stand ?
“ Yet what's this strikes the hearing
With no uncertain sound ?
Quite the reverse of cheering,
From all about the ground?

It plainly seems to say-
The loaf wants change of leaven;
Your lot has had its day!'

IRST, Sir, I must apologise for rot
having represented You in places
of public amusement. But during
these election times I have been Con-
servative, that is, I have kept myself
to myself in my room, in order to
keep myself calm, before proceeding,
in state, to the real Private Box of
the Political Theatre, the Ballot Box.
True, I did drop in to see the

highly commend the old-fashioned

THORNE and Miss LARKIN in the last
scene, whereas Silky, Goldfinch,
and Widow Warren, they hear the
Commendatore-like ghost-raps at
the doors. The play is a curiosity,
and as such ought to be seen. But
how it ever was at any time a success
is beyond the imaginative powers of
Your Representative. Where's the wit? Where's the
epigram? Where, save the one I've mentioned, are the
telling situations ? Where, and in whom, is there any
possible interest ? And yet great names have been asso-
ciated with it; and Young Dornton, old Dornton, Widow
Warren, and Goldfinch, were household words with play-
goers. In the Burlesque there is a very funny Spanish
dance by MR. JAMES, as the short-tailed Flunkey, Ruy Blas. This
is the First Scene.
Miss KATE BISHOP looks charming as Don Casar de Bazan, and
MR. THORNE is a diabolical ruffian, “with a song," encored till
there are no more verses. The “political hits of the day,” even at
this time, did not take on the night your Representative was
present, and I do trust sincerely that we have now exhausted
this vein. Thank goodness, in Ruy Blas, no one is made up as
MR. GLADSTONE, or MR. LOWE, or MR. DISRAELI. Cheap fare at
the best, and all very well in its way, for once, and away, and then
have done with it.
There are, Sir, certain amusements which Your Representative has
not yet done, and the chiefest is the Polytechnic.
Now that the holidays have finished, there is some chance of
getting comfortably into this Amusing and Instructive Institution. Coming to think of it, a place of Popular Instruction where Useful
Knowledge is imparted viva voce, is something that ought to be highly prized by diners-out, loungers, and vapid conversationalists
who scarcely read the newspapers, and seldom open a book. There are lots of such beings. To them a shilling'sworth in the “Poly"
would be a blessing. There, without poring over musty volumes, or spending pounds in books, they would learn (and be subsequently
able to talk about it learnedly, and get quite a reputation for science at dinner-parties), for example, what India Rubber is (this subject
they could introduce humorously at a whist party); what Sugar is made of; who invented Corkscrews; the difference between “ Car-
bonic” and “Carbolic;" all about Soda (without brandy); all about “Potass ;” particulars as to Salt, Mustard, Pepper, Bread,
and the amount of starch in collars and potatoes ; on all of which subjects they, by the outlay of one shilling, might realise hundreds
in the way of subsequent betting. I mean in this form: “I bet you you don't know what India Rubber is made of." Some one will say
“Elephants,” another will suggest “ Indian Water-Rats' hides," and a third will, after some consideration, expect that it grows, but
how, or where, or what as, he will be uncertain.
Try Cork. Ask how this is made. Bet always; only be prepared by a visit to the “Poly” when they are lecturing on such useful
sabjects. You'll get more knowledge of “Ashantees” out of dissolving views than out of newspapers or maps.
French and German might be popularly taught in this way, and I recommend the notion (free of charge) to DR. CROFT and the
spirited Directors of the Polytechnic Institution.
Griselda is to come out of the bills next week, and Marie Stuart, by MR. WILLS, who wrote Charles the First for MR. IRVING at the
Lyceum, is to be produced. MR. Rousey is to play John Knox. (JOHN KNOX would have been, by the way, a first-rate name for a
footman who goes with the carriage: Joun gets off the carriage, and John Knocks. This par parenthèse.)
Well, I hear that John Knox, the Calvinist, is to be shown in love secretly with Marie Stuart. I do not know what sort of a turn
the romantic Author has given to this hidden passion, but if Marie were made to marry J. K., then at the end of the piece there would
be an opportunity for a similar tag to that of Box and Cox—the immortal (or im Morton) Box and Cox-only we must suppose Cox
to be Darnley, Box Bothwell, and Penelope Anne, Marie. Then it would go something like this :

A case occurred to my mind of a friend of mine, who, on being
rejected by the lady to whom he had been paying his addresses, had
struggled with his emotions on a hearthrug, and, on partially re-
covering his equilibrium, had attempted to utter the words, “Fare-
well, thou heartless one!" when he found himself choking after the
“farewell,'' then the word "heartless” got twisted in his throat,
and became something like "hearthrug, which made her laugh,
and caused him to rush out of the room and out of the house, and
when he tried to hail a cab he found that his voice had left him,

Friends came in to see me, and were horrified, petrified. Would
it be all right for Monday night? that is, for the great speech ?
I feared not.
Each one impressed upon me his particular remedy.
The first said : galvanism. He regretted that the Polytechnic
wasn't open on Sunday, as there was galvanism always going on
there. This lead incidentally to a discussion on the advisability of
an Act for the Opening of the Polytechnic on Sunday; with gal-
vanism. I could only listen.
My friend, who made the proposition, wondered that I hadn't a
pocket galvanic machine by me. Everyone had, he said. He
hadn't; and no one who called that day had.

have worked well for BUNG. How it was
likely to profit him has, indeed, been fore-
told. It was pointed out that tipplers,

nalian as well as a moral legend; witness
drinking songs which our forefathers used
to sing after dinner. Now, if Publicans,
in consequence of the Licensing Act, sell
more liquor now in less time than they
used to before, they have to thank the

work for more wages. Proportionate thanks
are due from them to MR. GLADSTONE'S

the following item

tainted or diseased pork may find that he has driven his pigs to a
pretty market.
Steeds featly groomed, and bitted fair,
When rose the cry, “They're off !”-and off they were !
And then was seen, 'spite of friends' favouring cheers,
How work of five long years,
Upon the stoutest charioteer will tell ;
And most on him, who, in each race,
Had joyed to force the pace,
And urge his steeds not wisely but too well.
While Dizzy, with his team well in command,
Hath held his patient hand,
Nor thrust it forward, with more law,
Than backward he could draw,
Nor, for speed risking smash,
E'er overplied the lash,
Nor, with too eager pole,
Pressed for the goal!
See him creep up and on,
Ere the first mile they've gone,-
Neck and neck, head and head, and nose to nose, -
Till, nose in front, then head,
Then neck, then quarters, led ;
But as ahead he dashed,
Chariot with chariot clashed,
As with a dextrous twist
Of reins and wrist,
The sharper charioteer the stronger caught,
And, hurled out of the course to grief behold him brought !
And now, grim GLADSTONE, queered and cleared,
In front the Sphinx-like Dizzy hath appeared,
And ever, with each length,
Growing in skill and strength,
Further and further still ahead he shows !
While, dropping still behind,
In temper touched, and wind,
Gaunt GLADSTONE, ne'er so gallant though he be,
With a protesting frown
The proud if painful crown,
Wrenched from his brow-his rival's prize-must see!
And, checked and checking, second at the post,
Must own the race is lost-
The race, not always to the strong-
Lost with the crown that may be worn too long!

THE SPRING MEETING, FEB. 1874.
FINAL HEAT.
(A Second Isthmian Ode, by Punch's own Pindar.)
EIGHT months, and more, have past
Since PUNCH sang last
The glories and the shames
Of Britain's Isthmian Games,
And painted, neck and neck,
White with the foam-wreath's fleck,
The steeds that swept the chariots along,
Of Dizzy Sphinx-like, and of GLADSTONE strong.
Now, once again, he sues
The Epinikian Muse
To guide the pencil, and to point the pen,
That paints the conflict of these mighty men.
Now for five years the piny* crown
Hath shadowed GLADSTONE's frown;
And who of men can say,
But he that, through the burden of the day,
That garland's spiky twine,
Keen needles of the pine,
Hath round his temples worn,
How, like a crown of thorn
The bright but bitter bough
Can into furrows fret the brow
That its contested diadem hath borne ?
Lo, now we hear, again,
The rival chariots thunder o'er the plain ;
Again, the same strong charioteers behold,
With loose hair and tense rein,
And thews' and sinews' strain,
Behind their rival steeds, on smoking axles rolled !
But “Peace” and “Progress” are not now the names
That GLADSTONE's team of harnessed coursers claims;
I read, instead, branded upon their backs,
“Economy," "Repeal of Income-tax;"
While “Bung” and “Bunkum," still to Dizzy dear,
Scarce altered, reappear
In the euphonious pair “ Our Bibles” and “ Our Beer,”
A team that works, in concert, side by side,
Maugre strange contrasts in such names implied.
Sudden the challenge to the race was given,
Launched like Jove's bolt out of a clouldless heaven;
And scarce was time the chariots to prepare,
To have the harness yare,
• A garland of pine was the prize of the winner in the Isthmian Games.
SITTINGS IN ERROR.
SITTING at a pic-nic on a little mound of earth, which in your
short-sightedness you choose as most convenient for a seat, and
discover, when too late, is in reality an ant's nest.
Sitting with your legs cramped on the knife-board of an omnibus,
while your two neighbours' two umbrellas are both dripping down
your neck.
Sitting (reverentially, if possible) at church, in front of some
spoilt children who examine your back hair.
Sitting on a costly pair of Chelsea china figures, which, for safety
sake, you put in your coat-pocket rather than allow them to be
packed and carried to your house.
Sitting at your ease in the enjoyment of a snooze, while the train
stops at the station at which you should get out.
Sitting for three-quarters of an hour after the ladies have retired,
in order to hear slangy stories, or talk politics or shop.
Sitting on your wife's pet pussy-cat or pug-dog, which in the
dusk has not been noticed asleep in your arm-chair.
Sitting on a bag of grapes, or plums, or apricots, or peaches, which
you are bringing home from Covent Garden in a cab.
Sitting in the stalls (where you go to see good acting) just behind
a lot of ladies, dressed in the height of fashion, with their back hair
decked with flowers, and with ribbons in profusion piled up in a
pyramid on the tip-top of their heads.
Sitting on a pair of stockings which your wife, good soul, was
darning, and which she hid so hurriedly (with her needle sticking
in them) underneath the anti-macassar, when visitors disturbed her
in the afternoon.
A Contrary Wind.
ON Candlemas Day the sky was dun;
One general cloud concealed the sun;.
And Winter ought, says the ancient rhyme,
To have most of it gone at Christmas time.
Whereas there was frost, a great deal more,
After the festival than before.
Accordingly, this year, Winter's flaw
Blew right in the teeth of that old saw.

SONG AND SENTIMENT.

a sentimental manner“ Why I love thee,

This seems just such a song as little
Alice might expect to hear sung to her in
Wonderland, where the roses, if appealed
to, would be sure to make reply. But
where, out of a fairy tale, are roses ever
found to answer when one speaks to them?
and although we may know something of
the language of flowers, should we clearly
understand them if they really made reply?
Putting sentiment aside, one would say
the song is hardly so polite as one might
think it. “Ask the roses” is at best an
evasive sort of answer, and, taken as an
artful shifting of the question, seems
equivalent to the vulgar schoolboy phrase of

THE PROPHET JAMAIS.
It will be recollected that, whilst the French troops
were occupying the present capital of Italy, M. ROUHER,
Imperialist Minister, declared that Italy should go to
Rome—"jamais !” 'M. JAMAIS has now published a
letter in the Ami de l'Ordre, recommending the Bona-
partists to bide their time during MARSHAL MACMAHON'S
seven years, at the end of which M. JAMAIS thinks it will
arrive. Accordingly, M. JAMAIS predicts that
“The intermediate régime will never dare to meet the verdict
of the country. When universa) suffrage is called upon, I am
convinced the citizen class, cured of its extravagances (the great
majority of the electors), will be in accord to re-establish what
the insurrection of Paris broke to pieces."
M. JAMAIS may possibly prove a truer prophet for the
Bonaparte dynasty than he did for the Papacy. There
is no knowing what seven years may bring forth, espe-
cially in France; and the prophecy that, one of these
days, there will be a NAPOLEON THE FOURTH, may by-
and-by be fulfilled, notwithstanding that at present
it can hardly be mentioned without provoking the
exclamation=“Jamais.''
Channel Insular Government.
THE Standard announces that a vacancy in the judicial
bench of Jersey has been filled by the appointment of MR.
BRIAR, formerly a ship-captain, and for several years,
up to about twelve months ago, harbour-master at St.
Helier's. According to our Conservative contemporary,
"Judges in the island of Jersey are appointed without
any regard to their special aptitude for the duties of that
important position by reason of any legal knowledge
they possess.” The Judges derive their office from the
Sovereign People, who elect them. No doubt they do
indifferently administer justice. Thus much for Home
Rule in Jersey. Who imagines that it wouldn't do
equal wonders for Ireland ?

And reaped reward in clamour for Home Rule.
To all true Liberals liberty is dear.
Restrictions for estrangement gave them cause.
Why vex and anger them that love their beer
By Sabbatarian sumptuary laws?
And some there were, in cynic sort that stood

ELEGY ON AN EX-MINISTRY.
THERE lies a Government, from care and strife,
Where now at last its members find release.
They should enjoy repose ; for, e'en in life,
As everybody knew, their end was peace.
Peace they so loved, that, though to pay for aught
Above all woes they deemed affliction sore,
High was the price at which that peace was bought;
And may it, in the end, not cost us more!
To one supreme intent their minds they gave;
They made economy their sovereign good.
Their chiefest purpose was expense to save,
And show as large a surplus as they could.
This all-important object to obtain,
On smallest means that offered they would seize,
And all their energies were wont to strain,
With view to skin a flint or pare a cheese.
Hence, in all humbler service of the State,
_ Retrenchment without mercy they pursued.
Thus hard dismissal, and the pauper's fate,
Unhappy clerks and dockyard workmen rued.
Men cared not for the glory of the earth,
_They, whose sole question touching public land
Was how it best would pay, as money's worth.
Why should a useless Epping Forest stand ?
Ah, what avail economies none feel
But those they pinch! Alas, what signifies
A sight of good you've done the commonweal
When individuals all denounce your eyes ?
They sacrificed the Irish Church, intent
On justice ; loyal friends they rendered cool;

Shirley Brooks.
BORN APRIL 29, 1818.
DIED FEBRUARY 23, 1874.
The relations of Punch and its readers have grown so cordial, that the strokes of death among its Contributors
have become subjects of sorrow far beyond the circle in which the dead were valued as fellow-workers and loved as
friends.
The death we have now to mourn deprives this Journal, for the second time, of a most able and active Head.
SHIRLEY BROOKS has been taken from us in the full force of his buoyant and genial activity. Like so many
soldiers of the Pen, he has died, as a good Knight should, in harness, and at his post. His memory will be cherished
by all who knew him, and by those most who knew him best. Few men have ever brought to the hard service of the
Periodical Press more natural intelligence, a mind better equipped for its work, a more self-sustaining purpose to do his
best in all he attempted, and a more loyal determination to render true and due service in all he took in hand.
During the years-alas too few 1-of his Editorship of this Journal, its Staff have found in him-who was ever
the pleasantest of comrades--the most considerate, sagacious and kindly of Chiefs.
Of his achievements, beyond the pale of Punch, and in very various fields of Literature, of his acquirements as a
scholar, his brilliancy as a wit, and his genial and gentle qualities as a man, this is not the place to speak.
But it is not unbecoming, even in these pages, to say that these graces were so blended in him, that, large as is
the public loss in his death, it is little compared to the blank that death must leave in his family and among his
friends.
Nor can any better wish be offered to his successor in the Editorship of this Journal than that he may be guided
by as fine a taste, as clear a judgment, and as well directed a sympathy, as was SHIRLEY BROOKS.
ANOTHER blithe voice missing from our mirth,
One more bright blade to our wit-combats lost,
One springing seed of life the less on earth,
Nipt by what seems to us untimely frost.
Still our small band grows smaller: still there show
Fewer old faces, and more empty rooms :
Till, shadow-thronged, our table seems to grow
A place of memories--a field of tombs.
We knew his temper for right ruling fit-
His genial art that charms in guiding men.
So he has sat, the focus of our board,
The best jest, sunniest presence, cheeriest voice,
The centre of our council, deed and word,
And none has e'er misdoubted of the choice.
What though new growths spring to replace the old,
Though seats be filled as merrily and well,
Though young hands spring pencil and pen to hold,
And new themes find new wits the laugh to swell ?
It seems but yesterday that he was here,
The busiest in the business of the hour,
With ready judgment, quick wit, vision clear,
Full of the easy consciousness of power.
The clasp of his kind hand still seems to cling
To mine, his blithe voice still rings in my ear,
E'en while this poor memorial wreath I Aing,
With brother's hand, on his untimely bier
The life of Punch lives on, and knows not loss;
His deaths are theirs whom death robs of a friend;
Then let a timely tear his laughter cross,
And seemly mourning with his motley blend.
Untimely!-Yes, to those who count by time;
But who can say how long his life has been,
Gauged by the toil, the thought in prose and rhyme,
Experience of things heard and read and seen,
But three Springs have been green, since we stood round
To hear the clod fall on MARK LEMON's bier,
The wild-flowers yet have hardly claimed the ground,
Where sleeps the Chief whose memory still is dear.
Now our worn mourning must for him be donned,
That took his place, whom we left sleeping there,
Wondering, as homeward from the Church we wonned
Who likeliest to fill best that empty chair!
Recorded, in those swift growths of the brain,
Leaves of the tree, whose sap no winter stays,
That spring to die, and die to spring again,
But sum who knows what toil of nights and days!
And he was chosen, whom in heart we knew
The brightest, blithest, readiest and most bold,
The keenest eye to point wit's arrow true,
The deftest hand to plant it in the “gold.”
And who that marks God's way in nature traced,
The million germs to round one life that die,
Shall say that all this work, or aught, is waste-
Meteors that fade, e'en while they fire the sky.
To tell our sons what our friend wrote or thought
Little or nothing may o'er-float Time's foam ;
What he was we know best, with whom he wrought,
And they who sit, sad in a darkened home.

A CAPTIVE OF COOMASSIE.
In the Times' Special Correspondent's account of the
Missionaries in captivity at Coomassie, there is a passage
which will give not a few readers some satisfaction:-
"On the 9th of August they arrived at a village about twelve
miles from Coomassie. They there met a Frenchman named
BONNAT, who had been captured at Ho, on the east side of
the Volta. When the Ashantee army approached he remained
in his factory for the purpose of selling them powder and guns;
but they took the powder and guns for nothing, and himself into
the bargain."
Served him right. So fare all caitiffs who sell guns
and ammunition to our savage enemies. Such is the
natural wish of every Briton; but with a qualification.
If the guns which M. BONNAT sold the Ashantees were of
Bromwicham make, and the powder was only just strong
enough to burst the guns, then indeed a British patriot
might pity that poor Frenchman.
THE CUP OF PERSECUTION.
THE Bishop of Breslau, MGR. FÖRSTER, is one of the
Ultramontane Bishops who have had their goods dis-
trained upon for fines incurred by disobeying the
Prussian laws. The diocese of Breslau is bisected by the
Austro-Prussian frontier, and MGR. FÖRSTER has applied
to Austria for protection. To this request, says a con-
temporary, “the Austrian Government is not believed
to have made a reply;” but Austrian papers assert that
a certain castle “is to be held in readiness as a refuge
for the persecuted prelate, should his house be rendered
utterly uninhabitable by the removal of his household
furniture.” The castle thus stated to be reserved as an
asylum for MGR. FÖRSTER is the Castle Johannisberg.
There, indeed, he will find a refuge, and not only that,
but also, you can imagine, a solace for persecution.
Will he not drown his sorrows in Johannisberg ? Then,
if it please his Lordship, he can sing Hoc est bonum.
As the boys and girls say-How awfully jolly for BISHOP
FÖRSTER!

No; in Hellas' lovely legends Punch, at least, will claim his share, Though misses we are sure to have, and muddles not a few,
So here goes for his “ Aurora," after Guido's fresco fair!
Let's hope our new-born Graces from their Phoebus may take cue.
Above the stately door-way of the Rospigliosi Hall,
As sun in sky new life evokes with every quickening beam,
The rosy-fingered Lady of the Light begems the wall;
What new life has our Phoebus into old cries served to stream!
As, scattering flowers, she wings her way before Apollo's team, If the sun to paint us pictures takes photographic pains,
While the young Hours, around him, dance in the Sun-God's beam. What pictures has our Phoebus developed from his brains !
So Punch, if not al fresco, will cartoon his “ Opening Day;"
Round Punch's Phoebus Punch's Hours shall wing their joyous way;
Upon films how transparent, breathed on his chemic glass,
And the Opening Day of Parliament shall his Aurora be,
What evanescent pictures made for permanent to pass !
And new-arisen Dizzy in his car-borne Phoebus see!
What negatives to positives, and vice versâ changed,
What flats as seeming solids, shows as substances arranged !
Of Apollo “the far-darter's " long-bow feats let HOMER tell,
But for each inch e'er Phoebus shot Dizzy has shot an ell:
Nothing, in fact, the Sun-God in photography can do,
And what is Phæbus' old light to the new light Dizzy shows ? But Dizzy, our Apollo, does as well, and better too.
Let's hope it may not prove a case of “light come" that “light goes.” | Self-made, and sui generis, perhaps autotype he'll prove,
And “permanent” proclaim himself- until he likes to move !
And round him, like the circling Hours, let Ministers revolve, *

MUSIC IN A MEETING-HOUSE.
On Monday last week, according to the
City Press, a Lecture was delivered by the
REV. NEWMAN HALL on “The Dignity of
Labour.” On this occasion “the proceed-
ings were opened by prayer,” and, in the
course of them, “the organist delighted
the audience with a well-chosen selection
of operatic and other music,” which in-
cluded the Conspirators' Chorus, the Legend
of Madame Angot, and other pieces from
the comic opera of that name. The con-
gruity of these performances, with the rest
of “the proceedings,” has been questioned ;
but why proceedings which included light
music should not be opened as they were,
well be alleged against saying grace before
dinner, and its attendant light conversa-

were sung to airs from Madame Angot ;

win
EXECUTION IN PRUSSIA.
ACCORDING to the Volkszeitung of Cologne, a riot was
occasioned on Saturday last week by the removal of the
goods distrained by the political authorities from the
residence of the BISHOP OF MÜNSTER:-
“The resentment of the Roman-Catholic populace was
increased by the fact that the person who took charge of the
furniture was a Lutheran joiner.”
In this country there is, happily, no need for putting
an execution into the house of any Roman-Catholic
prelate. But, even if such there were, the offence which
that proceeding might occasion would probably, at least,
not be aggravated by any invidious antagonism of creed
on the part of a sheriff's officer, or a man in possession.
Unnecessary provocation would not have been given by
the seizure of the BISHOP OF MONSTER's furniture, if
the person who took charge of it had been a gentleman
of the Hebrew persuasion.

G LATEST FROM IRELAND.
THERE is a new movement, and, of course, a new
“era” in Ireland. The movement is one for forming a
National Roll of those who are in favour of Home Rule.
The first signatures were appended to the Roll at a
meeting held last week, in a place which has witnessed
many new movements and eras commenced and ended-
the Rotunda in Dublin. The national colour, and
singularly enough, the colour which is usually associated
with simplicity and credulity, was sufficiently displayed
in the course of the proceedings. The table at which the
Chairman sat was covered with green baize; the cards of
membership, produced by the Secretary, were green;
and a badge of membership-green, we cannot doubt-

meeting, but disapproved by the M.P.'s and others on
the platform. It is interesting and, perhaps, instructive,
also to note, that the large volume which held the

shilling each per annum) was bound in-calf.

GELELE was anxious that MR. SKERTCHLEY should see

UNCH hopes it is not profane to quote the Psalmist's—“All

that, like other Grasses, they should become Hay, and in that
form be pitchforked from the lower level of the Commons
to that receptacle for ripened reputations — that Parlia-
mentary hay-loft—the Upper House ?
Hence, the last act of W. E. G.'s official life was to make
Hay when the sun did not shine, and to pitchfork into the
Upper House a batch of his most loyal and laborious lieu-
tenants, in and out of Office MONSELL and CARDWELL, and CHICHESTER FORTESCUE, LORD ENFIELD and LORD ELIOT (live sons of live

Where never winds breathe keenly,"
these, being translated, sit as my Lords Emy and CARDWELL, CARLINGFORD and COTTESLOE, STAFFORD and KIRKELLA.
It would be hard to deny our Upper BENJAMIN his spell at Hay-making too, particularly now his sun is shining so bright. And
where could he find a better fork-full than in Punch's good friend, SIR JOHN PAKINGTON, always so "cut and dry” that he may be
said to have been half way to Hay already-marked, as it were, for the pitchfork, even before his elevation? So SIB JOHN is translated
into BARON HAMPTON.
We would fain say of the whole batch, as SHAKSPEARE sings of ihe roses, –
“Of their sweet deaths are sweeter odours made."
May they bear with them, to the existence they are entering, a whiff of the wisdom gathered in that they are leaving a wholesome
breath of the Commons, to freshen the closer atmosphere of the House Hereditary.
A Voice from the Tent of Achilles !
But not such a clarion-note as the son of Peleus sent forth, when standing at the ditch-
“Thrice great Achilles spake,
And thrice in heat of all the charge the Trojans started back.”
The trumpet of our Achilles sends forth but an uncertain sound,
“I will be your leader, an you must needs have me--though for my own part, look you__"
In short, we have here a most qualified acceptanceship of the responsible duties of Head of Her Majesty's Opposition, in the tone
of a General who, seeing his troops in hopeless confusion, and already demoralised on the eve of battle, resumes, half-heartedly
and reluctantly, the command he had laid down in the discouragement of recent and unexpected defeat-more after the fashion of a
Spanish than an English Captain.
But better a ieader on any terms, even such shrewdly qualified ones as those of this letter, than a pack of riotous hounds without a
whip, an army of sheep without a shepherd-such as our Liberal array seemed dissolving into-with just “ vis " enough to quarrel
among themselves, none to face their foemen in the field.
But let Achilles only take the field, and we may trust his temperament to show fight.
So let BRITANNIA bring him his arms, wrought by Vulcan, including the famous Shield, (in his own version,) and let us await his
battle-cry, till (in old CHAPMAN's rendering)-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A TEN-YEAR-OLD MARTYR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
THERE will be a great deal of war-paint going
round soon, in the shape of titles, honours, and decora-
tions, official rewards for killing, slaying, and burning.”
Will you give a decoration to the little motherless girl
of ten, LOUISA Row, who “undertook the cooking”
for her father, "a labourer," and his family, and died in
the execution of her duty ?
She has not killed anyone, black or white, except her-
self; she has not burned anyone's huts, or anyone's
villages-she has only burned herself. She will get no
glory, unless you, with a stroke of your pen, will put
one little star of honour upon her unknown grave.
THE AUTHOR OF “OLIVE VARCOE."
Will our Correspondent accept this inscription for her
poor little martyr's tombstone ?
Duty's small Servant, without prize or praise,
How soon on thy hard life hath death come down !
Take this brief record of thy childish days-
Gold, tried with fire, makes the best Martyr's Crown.
*" A painful death by burning has happened at Torquay.
LOUISA Row, aged ten, lost her mother a few weeks ago, and
undertook the cooking for her father, a labourer, and the rest of
the family. She had well performed the duties devolving upon
her since her mother's death, until one day she went too near
the grate, her frock was ignited, and she was terribly burned.
The poor child lived several days after the accident. At the
inquest, a verdict of Accidental death' was returned.”

THE Romans thought precious little of the Snow.
They spoke of it as Nix. VIRGIL, who hated cold, wrote
plaintively to his friend TIBULBULUS, “ Nix má dolor,"
to Snow is really a grief to me ;” and this line was sub-
sequently adopted by the celebrated DUNTAXUS KANTOR,
the great comic singer of his day, and formed into a
popular Roman chorus, since rendered into English
as" Nix my dolly." The above information may be

THE Special Reporter of the Daily Telegraph records
the following expression of loyalty at the late meet of
the Queen's Stag-hounds, attended by HER MAJESTY and
the DUCHESS OF EDINBURGH:-
“A squat church tower lifted itself above a cluster of
houses."
-What Quaker could keep his hat on after that ?
And she was dying, with the pitiless cry
Of box and pit and gallery, in her ear,
“Give us thy life, but act, and, after, die;
It is to live with thy life we are here."
Thou art at rest, Poor AIMÉE ! bravelier none,
Or less complaining, bowed to Heaven's dark doom;
More modestly and meekly ne'er was one

AIMÉE DESCLÉE.
BORN 1837. DIED MARCH, 1874.
" AIMÉE:” sweet name! Ere she who bore it died
On the steep steps that scale the House of Fame,
Critical Paris, in her cynio pride,
Had turned to truth the omen of the name.
For Paris loved her : gave her all the heart
She has to lend to those whom she loves best.
Nor Paris only: this, our busy mart,
Gave her the love less readily profest.
Hers the High Art, that keeps Truth's lowly way,
A way that asks patience and pride to tread,
Biding sore travel many a dusty day,
Staying a high heart, oft, on bitter bread :
Seeing adventurers by other roads,
Shoot, swift, to loud-voiced name and public stare,
Learning to steel heart to Ambition's goads,
From Siren songs of praise the ear forbear.
Such was the life she lived for many a year
Of little-valued, less-rewarded, toil,
Till when Fame's trump rang for her, sweet and clear,
Her ear was dulled by weary wait and coil.
Then came a space of summer, all too brief,
With fruit of Art, and swift-sprung flowers of fame,
What skill so touched the truths of joy and grief,
So waked the theatre to loud acclaim !
But too late came that harvest of her pains,
The roots of Death had struck deep in her heart;
And what cares Death for glory or for gains,
Guerdon of that short life, so spent for Art.
Cruelty to Men and Animals.

the Jaffa plague-patients! Then, again, what will the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals say to a “ Dromedary taking
thirty-nine invalids to St. Vincent” ?
Loyal and Managerial.
“I'll do something to attract the Public,” said the Manager of
a London Theatre which had not been doing very well lately, I'll
do something, and that too on the DUCHESS OF EDINBURGH's proces-
sional day. If I can't draw, hang it, I can illuminate."
He did. It attracted crowds-outside.
BAL-CONIC SECTIONS.

spectators on the entry of the DUCHESS OF EDINBURGH, a Corre-

to the Acts, in question. They do not interfere with law-abiding
citizens; but they do keep quiet those who would otherwise
be a terror to their fellow-subjects."
Sound sense, SIR MICHAEL, simply spoken.
And so is what followed in your rejoinder to MR.
BUTT. “Local wants might with advantage be dealt with
by local tribunals—but not only in Ireland - in England
and Scotland as well. This is Home-Rule of Home
matters not for Ireland, but for all parts of the Empire.”
But then it would rob MR. BUTT of his cry, and MR.
SULLIVAN of the sale of his Nation.
MR. SULLIVAN made a slashing maiden speech, with
a good deal of fire and fun, to prove that the Coercion
Acts are not wanted in Ireland—which MR. SULLIVAN
does not for a moment believe-and wound up with a
peroration of Irish brilliancy, if of Irish blarney too.
“He looked forward to a brighter and happier future, not
only for his own country, but for England. They were tired
of hatred, and would be glad to have a spell of love. If the
Irish had hated, it was because the English in their place would
have hated too; if they had been angered, it was because the
English, under the same goad, would have been similarly roused.
They were there to fight with Constitutional weapons; to meet
friendliness with friendliness, not to be received with taunts,
or, if they were, they could bear them with the equanimity of
a party that felt they had the power in their hands."
Delightful, if true, MR. SULLIVAN!
The House divided, 315 against 50 for MR. BUTT's
Amendment.
The first thing the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER

OUR LEADER ON THE EVENT OF THE WEEK.
SPRING has returned with scrupulous punctuality. The first
flowers are emerging from the bosom of the earth in our front and
back gardens, the first leaves are tinting landscape and lawn with
their emeraldine hues. There is, in the absence of a searching wind,
and when it does not freeze or snow, a balmy breath in the air, which
stirs the sap and the blood of the young, quickens the languid circu-
lation of those who are advanced in life, and affects even middle-
aged persons with an undefinable feeling of satisfaction.
The dark days of Winter are gone with the pantomime and the
pudding of Yule-tide, the sun rises at 5:43 A.M., the gates of
Kensington Gardens remain open until half-past six in the gradually
lengthening evenings.
Many notable anniversaries recur with sunshine, and the song of
birds, and the sweet breath of violets, and delicate portions of
roasted lamb. There is the day which law and long-established
usage have for ages appropriated to pecuniary transactions between
landlord and tenant; there is the day, the initiatory one of the
coming month, from which the spread of refinement and the exer-
tions of the London School Board have not yet succeeded in banish-
ing the generally harmless, but always irrational, practice of
stultification; and there is that great annual festival, which the

Which to prevent we means must plan,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[APRIL 4, 1874.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

VA
FORESA
N'if Punch—(quod Düi avertant!) had to form an Administration, he
would pray that it might be after a resignation just before the open-
ing of a Session, for then Ministers can fairly call upon ex-Ministers
to do all the “cleaning up," to explain away the jobs, get out of the
messes, dodge the questions,-nay, even to defend the estimates,
while Ministers have but coolly to ask for what they want in advance, and get it.
Thanks to this happy conjuncture, we have had the pleasant sight-to an ironical
Punch-of MR. SHAW-LEFEVRE getting up again to defend the purchase of the
Dromedary—that very fishy bargain of the late Admiralty, in which the Pall Mall,
and one or two other people and papers, will insist on seeing something very like a job-
a sop, they say, to the Union Steamboat Company, who sold her just after they had
been forced to give up that capital Zanzibar contract, so handsomely conceded by the
RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT LOWE.
GAMBOURNE -DEL-
If the Dromedary was a job, (MR. LEFEVRE ingenuously pleads,) she was such a little
one-only cost £15,000 at first, and carried a load of soldiers to the Gold Coast (when
we had to hire transports for the trip at twice the money), and didn't go to the
bottom, and wasn't so much slower than her comrades, and isn't so very rotten, after all-at least, has a right to the benefit of the doubt
on that point, till she is surveyed and condemned. And then MR. SHAW-LEFEVRE will, we doubt not, be furnished with a fresh set of
reasons to justify the purchase.
Pleasant, as SAMUEL PEPYS would have said, to note how now-a-days every fault found with the late Administration is certain of
being fairly weighed, every blot hit in their record at once put in train of searching inquiry, every reason against anything of their
doing sure of the most impartial consideration.
New brooms never sweep anything so clean as the dirt left behind by the last tenants.
Of course it is not MR. WARD HUNT who need wince under my LORD LAUDERDALE's searching Monday review of our sea-going
iron-clads. It is not for nothing that his Lordship lives near a Dockyard, and keeps his weather-eye open. According to the counts
in my Lord's indictment, out of our 33 sea-going iron-clads, 13 want new boilers, while 7 are shaky, leaving us only 10 efficient armoured
ships out of our 33 on paper. Or, gauging the strength of their wood and iron, 16 of the 33 have only 4 inch plates-armour which guns
of the period can smash like paper-while of 14 the wood is rotten, be the iron what it may,
Of course, LORD MALMESBURY, as Minister in charge, waited for an explanation from my LORD CAMPERDOWN, Explainer for the late
Admiralty, and the Representative of ADMIRAL DUNCAN, made the best case he could for BRITANNIA's ugly ducklings. After all, there
is a crumb or two of comfort in store for us. If our 33 iron-clads are such a shaky lot, what of the 299 armoured ships of all nations,
which LORD LAUDERDALE hangs over us in terrorem ?
The DUKE of SOMERSET (still in his character of candid friend to his quondam colleagues), pointed out that the measure of work
doing in the Dockyards is the number of men employed; (delighted to hear it, from so good an authority). When he was in Office, he was
called extravagant-(never by Mr. Punch, he will také his davy)- because he employed 18,000 workmen. After '70, the number was
cut down to 11,200, but only to rise to 12,800 (in '71 and '72) and 13,500 (in '72 and '73). He should move for returns to show our
tonnage in iron-clads, and the life of their boilers.
Then there was talk about Weights and Measures, and a notice from the EARL OF LIMERICK, for returns of our Militia strength, and
statistics of its recruiting, which, he thought, would show falling off in that estimable force.
Opposition Explainer on his legs again, for late Government. LORD LANSDOWNE did not think there was any symptom of Militia decline.
25,000 to 26,000 recruits had enlisted last year-a fair proportion of the 28,000 required to keep up the establishment of 140,000, on the
five years' service scheme.
The same night the Commons had a vast variety of talk (à la WITITTERLEY) on a vast variety of subjects-Election Expenses,
Museums, Railway Accidents, the late Dissolution, Land Laws, the River Shannon, the Bengal Famine, Wormwood Scrubs, Civil
Service Writers, Telegraphic Communications, Foreign Office Clerks-(LOR) DERBY doesn't see his way to raise their salaries, and- pace
SIR DRUMMOND WOLFE, whose kind efforts for his quondam comrades do him credit-F. 0. Clerkships are the prizes of the Service already,
with their chances of a diplomatic début, and their social cachet); Sandhurst-(the War Office, we are glad to see, means to discon-
tinue the stupid blunder of sending young Officers back to school after doing duty with their regiments); Cavalry Inspection, and
Registration of Letters. A pretty good range!
Then we came to Income-tax, MR. SANDFORD moving to exempt £500 incomes-by way of raising the question how the Income-
tax might best be modified.
MR. SCOURFIELD could not admit we had a surplus, while we had a debt. At the same time he did not see why we should be in any
“desperate hurry to fritter our means away in paying our debts”-to quote BRUMMEL.
MR. LAING delivered an excellent lecture in favour of Income-tax "the key-stone of our finance, which has kept the arch tight since

and Pestilence; and they have had to do all this on
calculations, as MR. DISRAELI well reminded the House,
not of months, or weeks, or days, but of hours! The
critics complain that the rhetoric of Monday night was
below the occasion. Punch declines to endorse that com-
plaint. The facts were beyond rhetoric and they were
impressively stated. MR. DISRAELI's peroration was
quintessential and will not bear abridgment:-
“It bas always," he said, “ been a vulgar error to associate mili-
tary glory only with armies of great magnitude. But some of the
greatest military feats have been performed by very small armies.
În modern history, nothing, perhaps, is more illustrative of
this truth than the conquest of Mexico by Cortes. So great a
result effected by such slight means is not easily matched in the
history of men. Even in our own times, in that great Conti-
nental war which occupied a great part and the early portion of
this century, when hosts counted, not only by hundreds of thou-
sands, but by millions, were arrayed against each other, it was
a small army, admirably disciplined—which, to use the words of
their illustrious commander, would go anywhere-it was a small
army like that, under our matchless WELLINGTON, wbich really
decided the fate of Europe. I am not wishing to exaggerate the
gallant deeds, of which we are paturally proud, of SIR GARNET
WOLSELEY. I do not mean to say that they are to be counted
amongst the decisive battles of the world, but I think we may
say of them truly, that they are such deeds as thrill the hearts of
households, and, by the examples they offer of energy and
endurance, sustain and strengthen the tone of the nation."

Over the misty hill :
He sang it at noon, when the sun was bright
In the drip from the wheel of the mill :

Less of music in it than moan:
The song of a life that blank of glee

(A Morning Contemporary publishes the subjoined interesting
announcement:-“BRIGHTON AQUARIUM.-The Mexican Axo-
lotls, which have been for some time exhibited in one of the
handsome vases in the entrance-hall of the Brighton Aquariuni,
spawned about a month ago. As the parents showed every dis-
position to devour their eggs, the latter were removed to one of

I'm the Mexican Axolotl ;
And you all that gaze on me
Know a thing beyond ARISTOTLE,
Who the like of me ne'er did see.
By the many who come to Brighton,
When their minds they here recruit,
I'm imagined to be a Triton,
Like the Greater Water Newt.
I'm the Mexican Axolotl,
From my native clime I've come,
Not to be kept in a bottle,
But in Brighton's Aquari-um.
To quietude oft though sticking
When little inclined to move,
You behold me alive and kicking
Whenever I frisky prove.
I'm a creature between the fishes
And reptiles a place which fills,
For it breathes by lungs when it wishes,
And it likewise breathes by gills.
So I'm equal to respiration

answer.
MR. Bass, moving to do away with the

hung out of the County Courts,-was de-
feated by 215 to 52.
Doctors differ as to the value of this
drastic remedy for the serious disease of

Probably the Scotch tallyman, or travelling

of the disease, and the most regular cus-

MR. LOPES thinks credit a blessing to the

JAMES once, but last year's Select Com-

physic of Commitment that kept alive the

MR. DISRAELI, HER MAJESTY has been pleased to confer
the dignity of a Baronetcy on MR. WILLIAM HENRY
PEEK, one of the Members for Mid-Surrey. The Surrey
hills may now lift up their heads, for the PEEK of Surrey
has risen to an altitude not exceeded by the Peak of
Derbyshire. But we would rather compare the Surrey
PEEK to Mount Atlas, for Atlas was supposed to be a
Caryatid to the heavens, and PEEK, since December, 1868,
when he was first returned, “has given a consistent sup-
port to the Conservative Party.” Hence the elevation of
the Surrey PEEK, who (as we learn from the Daily
News), “as a thank-offering for being made a Baronet,
has forwarded a cheque for 2000 guineas to the Chairman
of the Surrey Sessions."
The Surrey Bench may congratulate itself on having
caught SIR H. PEEK red-handed ... and with his red-

April 20), had under con-
sideration two great Na-
tional Establishments —
both costly, both difficult
of administration, both
much distracted by the
many minds of men about
what they are and ought
to be-the Church in the
Lords, the Navy in the
Commons.
On the showing of the
parties officially in charge
- the ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY, and the FIRST
LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY
- both are nothing short of
rickety, and repairs in both
come ruinously expensive.
The Archbishop moved
for leave to bring in a Bill,
which may be profanely
described as one to restrain
Romanising Rectors from
kicking over Church ropes.
Where Ritualistic Rectors
and recalcitrant parish-
ioners come in collision,
either may go to the Bishop,
who, with three assessors
—the Dean, Archdeacon, or
Chancellor of the diocese, a
barrister of seven years'
standing, and a third of
the Bishop's own selection
-may hear arguments and
decide on the practice in
dispute, subject to appeal
to Archbishop, who may
refer the case to the Court above. If Bishop fissue monition forbidding
practice, it is to be stopped till Clergyman gets leave from higher Court of
Appeal.
LORD SELBORNE blandly wished well to the Bill, and was scandalised by the
enormity of costs in Church cases, as a great lawyer might be expected to be.
EARL NELSON was much exercised for the consciences of poor Ritualistic
parsons, forced to be lawless, because they really could not see how the law
could be binding on them. Lay consciences that feel a call to kick against
the pricks of law are not usually so much considered. LORD NELSON thought
the House ought really not to proceed to Second Reading till Convocation had
met, and considered the matter.
Convocation has usually thrown so much light on Church legislation ; and
is so eminently clear-headed, clear-spoken, and sound-judging a body!
The BISHOP OF LINCOLN, too, feared “There might be a schism between the
Upper and Lower House of Convocation, if the matter were pushed forward
with anything like intemperate and indecent haste!” Isn't that schism, in matters Ritualistic, a little past praying for?
LORD CARNARVON has had no official communication of the cession of Fiji to the British Crown. When it comes, then will come
“ considerations of climate and production, of winds and currents, of expense, of organisation of administration; and there was, lastly, but by no means
least of all, the very serious question of the feelings of the native races.”
“Tantæ molis erat Fijeiam condere gentem."
In the Commons we lingered awhile in Her Majesty's Dockyards, while ADMIRAL ELLIOT argued (as became the Member for Chatham)
that the late Admiralty had “disestablished the Dockyards,' and 'handed over the Navy to the tender mercies of private builders.
Even the breaking up of the old ships had been put out to contract; one ship sold for £500, and her copper bought back for £5000.
MR. HUNT deprecated a Committee, but promised attention. Just now his hands were really too full, and he wanted to get on with
the Naval Estimates. Would the Admiral be so kind as to shut up-
But MR. REED had a speech ready, and insisted on firing it off.
It was the very best thing that ever happened to the Navy when Government handed over the building of a good part of it to private
hands. Experto crede.
MR. REED ought to know. He was chief Government Constructor. He is head of a great Private Ship-building Company.
MR. SHAW LEFEVRE did what the grievance-mongers say we have never done-defended the Dockyards.
Then, on MR. DISRAELI'S Motion, the Vote for SIR GARNET WOLSELEY's grant of £25,000 was agreed to. HER MAJESTY wished to
add an hereditary distinction. SIR GARNET may succeed to either of two family Baronetcies, and, under these circumstances, feels he has
quite chances enough of hereditary rank. Besides, he really thinks he has been over-rewarded already. We don't; but the feeling is a
creditable one. And then, at last, the RIGHT HONOURABLE WARD HUNT reached the Navy Estimates.
0, what a speech was there, my countrymen! A bill of close on Ten Millions. Dockyard Establishments short by 800 men, for repairs
of Iron-clads, at an expense of one-third their original cost! Only 5,592 tons of Iron-clads, built in the year, though the vote taken
for 8,500 tons had been exceeded. This year we mean to build 19,470 tons.
Then for the debtor and creditor account of our economising friends on the other side. Of our forty-one sea-going Iron-clads (five still
on the stocks, by the way) only eighteen effective! Of our fourteen for coast and harbour defence, including the Devastation (we don't

NEW SPANISH WAR INVENTION.
A TIMES' telegram from Santander informs us that:-
"From one o'clock of the morning of the sixth to seven
o'clock of the morning of the eighth (fifty-five hours), 425 shells
were thrown into the town of Bilbao, there being constantly in
the air five projectiles.”
By simple arithmetic it follows that each shell must
have been thirty-eight minutes in the air. As the time
of flight of shells fired for the purposes of bombard-
ment, according to the system of artillery hitherto in
vogue, has never been known to exceed thirty-eight
seconds, it is evident that this Correspondent has brought
to our knowledge a wonderful discovery, which, if he
would be kind enough to discover and communicate,
our War Office authorities will, no doubt, immediately
adopt.
Nothing can be conceived more trying to the nerves of a
beleaguered garrison than a sucoession of shells, five at
a time, wavering for thirty-eight minutes over their
doomed heads, in a state of uncertainty as to where they
will pitch.
The only wonder is how the defenders of Bilbao have
been able to hold out so long against this fearful new
missile; and we hope, if Our Own Correspondent has not
invented it himself, that he will soon nose” out the
invention for the use of his country, whenever she is
called upon to provide bombarding matériel...
We should propose to christen this formidable projectile
the “Spanish-fly-shell."

The DUKE OF SOMERSET-who, like a certain other old gentleman,

the job. LORD CARLINGFORD-speaking with full official knowledge

MR. DISRAELI, in answer to a question about the appropriation of the

The Irish balance is a debt of £9,700,000, which will be paid in
seventeen years, and then there will be five millions' worth of
terminable annuities to divide. So, about 1893, Irish Pathriots look

WHAT BECOMES OF THE OLD RAILWAY SERVANTS.
MR. PUNCH,
Did you, Sir, ever see an old, or, rather, a very old Railway
Servant, more particularly a Guard ?' I never did ; and, I venture to
say, neither have you, nor any of your numerous readers. What
becomes of them ? This is the mystery which has long oppressed
me. I had often inquired of Railway Directors and Railway
Managers, and was always met by evasive replies. I inquired of the
men themselves, and have hitherto been met with evasion; but
their nervous start at the question showed something lay hidden,
which they were unwilling or afraid to divulge. At length, yester-
day, I found one who, under a solemn pledge of secresy as to his
| name and residence, revealed the startling secret.
Every Railway Servant, when he enters upon his employment,
signs an agreement that he will provided that he arrives at sixty
1 years of age-allow himself to be converted, by some process or
other, the secret of which is in the Manager's hands, into Buffers !

In a letter written to the Times a gentleman, under
the signature of “R. C. B. C.," announces that he has
established in Ireland an Irish School of Cookery. One
Irish dish should be tabooed in that school. There can
be no need of instruction how to make an Irish Stew,
considering that England's cooks have taught nothing
else since STRONGBOW's day: and the Irish, by this time,
are perfect masters of the process.

PRINCELY COTTAGES.
"The PRINCE OF WALES began, immediately after his mar-
riage, by building the Alexandra Cottages, a row of twelve
dwellings, built of Carr stone found on the estate, faced by white
stone, and each entered through a pretty porch, with gardens in
front and rear. For these a rent of £i per year is paid by the
tenant. The cost of the erection of each was £195. The Louise
Cottages, built on the West Newton portion of the estate, are
only inferior to the Alexandra Cottages in outward appearance;
but tbey are also inferior in rent, and even their outside is
attractive enough. They cost less than the Alexandra Cottages,
the money laid out for the erection of each being only £140. For
these the tenants pay a yearly rental of £3 108. each.
irly rental of £3 108. each. On the
whole, the Sandringham Cottages produce only about one and a
half per cent. on the capital invested.”—The Hour, May 12.
“THE Cottage-homes of England,
How beautiful they stand !”.
(So once FELICIA HEMANS sang,)
Throughout the lovely land!
By many a shining river-side
These happy homes are seen,
And clustering round the commons wide,
And 'neath the woodlands green.
The Cottage-homes of England-
Alas, how strong they smell!
There's fever in the cesspool,
And sewage in the well.
With ruddy cheeks and flaxen curls,
Though their tots shout and play,
The health of those gay boys and girls
Too soon will pass away.
The Cottage-homes of England !
Where each crammed sleeping-place
Foul air distils whose poison kills
Health, modesty and grace.
Who stables horse, or houseth kine,
As these poor peasants lie,
More thickly in their straw than swing
Are herded in a stye?
The Cottage-homes of England !-
But may they not be made
What Poetess FELICIA
In graceful verse portrayed ?
With chambers where a purer air
The sleepers' lungs may bless,
And pretty porches, gardens fair ?
The PRINCE OF WALES says, “Yes."
The Cottage-homes of England,
Whose aspect makes men wince,
May turn to happy dwellings yet,
With landlords like the Prince:
Then quicker brain and readier arm,
And more strength better spent,
May add an economic charm
To less than two per cent.
The Cottage-homes of England !
The toiler gay and blithe,
Who drinks his ale, and plies his flail,
And swings his sweeping scythe,
His sons and daughters, braced anew
With strength that nothing ails,
Will bless each Prince of landlords who
Does like the PRINCE OF WALES.

To his sisters who suffer from “Woman's Wrongs."
Her wrongs who must daily and nightly cower,
In the sway of a brute with a tyrant's power,
Who in sickening fear of her life must go
From the killing kick and the blinding blow.
Who, with all her sex's burdens, must weep
'Neath the weight of all man's strength can heap
On backs that their load at his will must take,
And hearts that, if they can't bear, may break.
Knot well the nine tails, strand on strand,
For the brute on a woman that lifts his hand;
And sharpen the claws of the cat to tear
His back with the pain he has made her bear.
And more power to COLONEL EGERTON LEIGH,
And more speed to the day Punch hopes to see,
When, woman's wrongs done away to begin,
Her “rights” are all that is left to win.

results of so rash an experiment.” Perhaps hydrophobia is incom-

is incompatible with human insanity. Or, in a case of self-inocula-

If it cost me a cold in the head, full-flow,
And the worst of woe in my corniest toe,
Or the crush of a Crystal Palace show,
In the bitterest east wind that May can blow;
Or the price of an Albert Hall first row;
If a Guildhall lunch I have to stow,
Though Hygeia to lobster and fizz say no;
If I sit at a window in sun or snow,
(And which is likeliest I don't know)."
I said, "I will see the Czar ere he go.”

“I will see the Czar," it was easy to say,
But not so easy to find the way;
For spend what I will, and go where I may,-
For an Albert Hall ticket though I pay;
Eat a Guildhall lunch ; in the east winds of May,
At a Fleet Street window spend most of the day;
With Aldershot dust though I cake myself grey;
Catch my death of cold upon Gravesend Quay;

And yet I was oft where the CZAR past by,
In what should have been reach of my glass and my eye,
But whether it was that he was shy,
Or, perhaps-as an English May does try
Even strong constitutions seriously, : ".
Felt a touch of neuralgia in the eye,
It seemed as if always, when he passed by,
His head was held low, and his hat held high;
So that all I could see-and how I did try!-
Was a bush of white plumes against the sky:
And when every one asked me, eagerly,
“ Did you see the Czar?” I could not say “aye,”
But was forced to say “no," decidedly.
I could not say I saw him how could I?
Who saw but the plumes in his schako fly.
Till, after a week of excitement high,
East wind, indigestion, and misery,
All the wool I got for a great deal of cry, i
Was a hat not a head, and a plume not an eye,
Nor an ear, nor a nose, nor a mouth, nor a smi-
-ling face, nor a sad one, to swear thereby,
That the CZAR was a Czar, not a hat plumed high,
With a bush of cock's feathers set artfully,
For the crowd to cheer as it whirled by,
With Princess and Duchess sitting nigh,
To lend the charm which can never die,
From the gracious smile and the gentle eye!

So, after all, I was forced to go,
For the little that of the Czar's looks I know,
To the Graphic and Illustrated, also,
And the photograph shops, where, row upon row,
The head of the Czar in all sizes they show;
Where I feel, as his photographs calmly I scan,
That the Czar's an exceedingly good-looking man;
And no doubt 'tis because he's a Russian ruler
We were cool to him, and he to us cooler.

A SUBURBAN SKETCH.
(TEACHING YOUNG HOPEFUL THE USE OF HIS EYES.)
THE INTERNATIONAL “DERBY.”
THERE are some who while Punch's Cartoon they admire,
When its foreign-bred horses and jockeys they see,
And its title peruse, will be apt to inquire
What this " International Derby" may be ?
Each ill-fated State 'neath the burden that cowers
Of soldiers and armaments one thing will own,
That this International Derby of ours
Is no International Derby and Joan.
Europe's Great International Derby to-day
On the broad “road to ruin” is run for a course.
'Tis the race who the biggest of armies shall pay :
And “ Deuce take the hindmost " its rule-man and horse.
All who in that race, by that rule, try their stride,
Whate'er they may own to, must feel in their hearts,
Though never so artful the jockeys that ride,
They are one and all making the worst of false starts.
There's France, of her blood and her breed though she brag,
With her temper, the best jock to steer her defies,
Takes each scrap of paper that flies for her flag:
Frets herself to a fever, bolts, kicks, starts, and shies.
See Germany rearing !—less speedy than safe
Wants the spur, but her blood up, a devil to go;
And her jock with a big whip her withers to chafe,
And sharp spurs, intends that his will she should know.
A wide berth France were wisest to give her, I ween:
If the German horse cannoned against her-my eye!
Their late match, methinks, should a lesson have been, -
She's too light now, whate'er she may be by-and-by.
As proud as a peacock, as stubborn as sin-
See, the bit in her teeth, Spain all over the course.
Was e'er such a pig-headed brute backed to win!
Mule or donkey, methinks, crossed with Barbary horse.
There's Italy, ill-trained, ill-groomed, out of form,
But a beauty, when once to condition she's brought;
With an honest jock up, who will weather the storm,
Though his nag has to carry more weight than she ought.
Who's that raw-boned, high-stepping, Roman-nosed nag,
Lashing out right and left, till " Ware kicker"'s the cry?
By her jock's stars and stripes, and his bunkum and brag,
'Tis the Yankee horse come “ The Europians” to try.
But nearer the post, watching our Derby crack,
What dark horse is that, for false starts far too cool,
With a look in her eye at once forward and back,
Rough in coat, but if points may be trusted, no fool ?
That's the Russian horse ; and the old Tartar blood
For pace and for pluck is a match for the best;
When we come to the scratch with a horse of that stud,
Our breed, bone and bottom, 'twill put to the test.
Meantime, while we doubt which strange horse bears the palm
For false starts and hark-backs, for cross cannons and kicks,
See our Derby horse, and his jock cool and calm,
With light snaffle, and spur that guides rather than pricks,
For the horse trusts the jock, and the jock trusts the horse,
In stable and paddock, in trial and race;
Both are game to ride straight, with an eye to the course,
And the sense when to wait, when to put on the pace.
And while horse and jock can this temper command,
Foreign horses let who so will fancy for me;
Punch will back his own lot, by his own stable stand,
In the faith that BULL's blood still the winner will be.
RITUALISM AND RACING.
It is rather unusual for Epsom Races to be run in June. A horsey
man considers it to be an unaccountable omission that the Derby
Day is not inserted in the Calendar among the “Moveable Feasts."

HORSE FOR EVER!
(Song of a Stable Mind.)
WHAT becometh of the Horse
When the breath has left his corse ?
Is the Noble Quadruped
Wholly done for when he's dead ?
Who conceives a higher sphere
Where the Horse is not as here,
Nor, in a superior state,
Runs for stakes, and cup and plate ?
There be Shades, with tails and manes,
Flitting o'er Elysian Plains ;
Races in those fields of rest:
Otherwise they can't be blest.

From on earth the Gallant Beast,
May perchance go to the hounds
In the Happy Hunting-Grounds.

SONG FOR A SPORTING GENT.
Lo, how the Welchers do abound
On every side of me!
Another Derby Day comes round,
Which here we are to see.
Now this year's Race will soon be run,
And, O my friends, how fast
Has been, besides, full many a one
Between it and the last !
Ah, who, although he stands to win,
But waits with anxious heart,
Lest he should lose no end of tin,
And trembling bides the start?
My Book although I've tried to make
Upon the surest plan,
It still may prove a great mistake,
So fallible is Man!
But hold, my tongue; be still, my lips;
From moral talk refrain.
On aught, except authentic “tips,"
Reflection is in vain.
Upon the Future they that choose
May stupid thoughts bestow.
Which horse will win, and which will lose,
Is all I want to know.

“He confessed he had fixed his entertainment to the Mayors

distinguished personages. In him the Municipal authorities
recognised a worthy leader and representative. “In late years
the taunts against Corporate bodies had been less frequent, and

less often at their expense."

FRANCE often does, made matters worse by the explana-
tion. So the bar was pulled out for FRANCE, and FRANCE
was pulled up to the bar; had to “toe the line" (as
sailors call it) ; was solemnly told by the SPEAKER to
consider himself admonished; considered himself
admonished accordingly, and did not appear to be a bit
the worse for it.
Honourable Members seemed much amused, and
FRANCE did not seem at all impressed. Probably he
will say, as the navvy said when his wife pitched into
him, “ It amuses them, and it don't hurt me."
Punch, for his part, would suggest that there is one
explosive which the House of Commons ought never to
play with, and that is brutum fulmen. Farces are out
of place on the floor of the House; and the SPEAKER
and MR. DISRAELI decidedly out of place in farce-parts.
MR. TORRENS McCULLAGH moved an Address praying

standing may be removed from active service, in peace,

was a grievance at the back of the Motion, of which the

and SECRETARY-OF-WAR were of opinion that Courts of
Inquiry might often be preferable to Courts-Martial,
and the House agreed with them by 91 to 31, though

staff service, supported the Motion.

When men like FALMOUTH, for the race-course hottest,
Breed the best horses, and disdain to bet;
As men dream of a Turf which honour rules,
Its winners not all rogues, nor losers fools.
Clear that Turf of its vermin parasitic,
Its filthy fringe, the spawn of lusts and lies,
But spare sneers, hyper- if not hypo-critic:
Love of the Horse in England never dies.
Whigs, Tories, foes else, friends in this we find-
The Turf's Blue Riband doth all parties bind!

"It is always more or less uncertain whether a Railway will produce a

ADULTERATION'S ARTFUL AID.
“Yesterday the House of Commons Committee on the Adultera-
tion Act of 1872 was wholly occupied with the examination
of two analysts, one from London, the other from Norwich,
where some articles of questionable quality are manufac-
tured. A newly-elected Member of the House and of the
Committee, had to sit and see an article of his own manufacture,
silver-medalled by the Moscow Exhibition as nutritious food
for infants and invalids, described as worthless for food,
indigestible, and likely to lead to the most serious results if
depended upon for infants or invalids, it being, in fact, nothing

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ISHOPS are not to speak till they are spoken to. So says the Public Worship
Bill, Clause Eight, over which the Lords had a long fight on Monday, June 8th,
-LORD SELBORNE moving to give the Bishops power to begin the fray by a
monition.
LORD SHAFTESBURY carried a Clause giving the Bishops discretion; for which
the Bishops should be very much obliged to him. If any of their Lordships
could give a little discretion to the Ritualising Clergy, it would be even more
conducive to the peace of the Church. Where parties bind themselves in writing
to submit to the arbitration of the Bishop, they are to be bound accordingly.
And security for £100 costs is to be given before appeal to the Judge. For has
not Themis a right to her turnpike-tolls ?
Altogether, their Lordships seem to be making a very good job of the Arch-
bishop's crook.
MR. DISRAELI presented a seven-chambered revolver at the head of the House
of Commons, bidding them stand and deliver their
Tuesdays to the use of the Government.

Then come a whole bunch of Irish Bills—anything but
"first-rate paper," so properly described by MR.
DISRAELI-qui s'y connait-as" second-rate,”—bringing
the Bills on the file to seventeen.
Then there are outstanding accounts for Education,
the Gold Coast, and other supplementary trifles.
Then there is Public Worship Regulation of which
the Commons may yet have to sing, -
Church Regulation is vexation,
Division is as bad:
MacKONOCHIE doth bother me,
And PURCHAS drives me mad !
So, “ Your Tuesdays, or your lives !” said the gallant
PREMIER, his seven-chambered revolver having grown
XXX
into a seventeen-chambered one by dint of talking, like
Falstaff's men in buckram.
It seems we are to see the New Rules under the
Judicature Act before the year is out. The selected
men have completed their draught. The Judges had
their first tasting Committee last Saturday. They liked
the first batch. They have to lay down three batches,
and mean to have good sound wine-in vino veritas-
wine which will stand water from the well of truth-the

The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER is going to
befriend the Friendly Societies by giving them Tables,
improving their registration, requiring them to show their
solvency at starting, and bringing the Burial Clubs
under the rule of the theatre-galleries—“Children in
arms not admitted.” Only the House of Commons is to be allowed its "Magsacre of the Innocents."
Tuesday:-“ Eleotion” always was a tough point in the Scotch Kirk, and to-night their Lordships "had a nicht o' it" over the
question who should elect the Meenister-Ratepayers, Congregation, or Communicants ?
LORDS GREY and CAMPERDOWN spoke for, the Macallum More and LORD ROSEBERY against, giving the election to the Ratepayers.
Said the DUKE-is there any human being as authoritative as the Duke on a Kirk question ?-the enemies of the Kirk would put in
bad men, as the Evil One sowed the tares. Wolves could not be trusted to choose collies. His notion of a constituency was con-
gregation plus Communicants. And this the DUKE OF RICHMOND, for the Kirk, accepted.
LORD SALISBURY purposes to add a Public Works Member to the Supreme Council of India. If India would only take his Lordships'
word for his Works! One thing is certain: there is no want of works for such a Member, if he had as many heads and hands as the
great Vishnoo himself, or any other Briaræus of the Indian Olympus.
Then their Lordships went to work on the Pastoral Crook, got to the BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH's “neutral ground," and stopped-
aghast at the sight of that “ Debateable Land.”
In the Commons we had MR. O'SHAUGHNESSY on the needs of Intermediate Irish Education, and MR. MELDON on the pay of Irish
National School Teachers“ CHARLES HENRY asking for more."
SIR M. HICKS BEACH, candid as usual, admitted that Irish Education, both Intermediate and National, was open to improvement, but
National School Teachers had had a rise two years ago (£104,000), out of payment by results; and there was another year to run before
the system was open to overhauling.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH STANDS CORRECTED.
MR. FRANCE, who was lately admonished
at the Bar of the House (and feels wonder-
fully well after it, considering) writes to
inform Punch he is not an Inventor of Ex-
plosives, as Punch in his Essence had de-
scribed him, but a Quarry Owner, with a
good deal of blasting to do. Hence his
quarrel with the Departments, who take
Official Patentees for their advisers on
matters involving the interests of dealers
in the patented articles, so putting Non-
Official Patentees and Inventors at a dis-
advantage. There is evidently a great deal
of highly explosive matter connected with
the quarrel, which seems a very pretty one
as it stands, and Punch is satisfied with
correcting his own mis-description. Ma-
DAME FRANCE is such a famous Inventor of
Explosives, that MR. FRANCE will easily
understand our transferring a description
so eminently applicable to the Country to
her namesake, the Man.

For the Sabbatarian clause of the Min-

of Lords will be Liberal enough to amend
